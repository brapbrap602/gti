<h1>Chapter 2141: Recognition and Unfamiliarity</h1><p>“I still don’t understand your meaning, Master Ning. Please be more direct.  With you protecting Liuli and shielding her from all storms, what can a humble cultivator like me possibly do?”</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brows, unconvinced by Master Ning’s words.</p><p>“Everyone in this world is caught in the cycle of calamities; I am no exception. Who can say for certain whether they will safely survive the next tribulation? I cannot remain by Liuli’s side forever…”</p><p>Master Ning’s tone was flat, as if she weren’t speaking of herself.</p><p>Liao Chen and the others were moved, softly exclaiming, “Master Ning!”</p><p>Master Ning waved them off and continued explaining to Qin Sang.</p><p>“As I said before, Liuli has feelings in her heart; cultivating the Supreme Forgetfulness technique is not what she desires. As her master, I naturally hope that one day, she will achieve great cultivation while remaining true to her heart.</p><p>“‘Supreme Forgetfulness’ and ‘Supreme Heartlessness’—a single character difference, yet for cultivators, it’s merely a difference in thought.  Cultivating this technique, even a slight misstep can be extremely dangerous, even leading to demonic possession. Liuli’s initial intention in cultivating this technique was to escape, thus planting a demon seed in her heart. I fear that in the future, she will instinctively avoid certain things, which will only hinder her cultivation.</p><p>“That’s why, while I can kill anyone else who dares to influence Liuli, I must be extremely cautious with you, Qin Shijun. Otherwise, if Liuli later sees you or learns something, it will only backfire.</p><p>“I have been pondering how to prevent Liuli from going astray, until your appearance, Qin Shijun! I found that there’s no one more suitable!”</p><p>Qin Sang remained impassive, but a suspicion dawned on him.  “Master Ning, you want…”</p><p>Master Ning nodded. “Every breakthrough is when the technique and Liuli’s temperament fluctuate most violently. You, Qin Shijun, are the demon in Liuli’s heart. I believe that if you are by her side during each breakthrough, especially during major breakthroughs, it should benefit her. You don't necessarily need to *do* anything! But if you participate in her breakthrough, it will forge a stronger bond.”</p><p>Qin Sang fell into thought. He couldn't be certain if Master Ning’s words were true. The jade Buddha granted him absolute rationality during cultivation, making it difficult to comprehend techniques like Supreme Forgetfulness, which are related to emotions and desires.</p><p>Qin Sang neither confirmed nor denied, instead asking, “Liuli has already entered the Void Refinement stage?”</p><p>He originally thought that she was at a breakthrough juncture, which is why she hadn’t returned in time.</p><p>Master Ning shook her head. “Liuli is currently in seclusion, attempting to break through the bottleneck, but she hasn’t yet succeeded. Moreover, I woke her up before your arrival, allowing her to leave seclusion.”</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly startled. “Why?”</p><p>Liuli's seclusion indicated that she sensed an opportunity for a breakthrough, an opportunity that would vanish quickly. Missing it could mean wasting hundreds or even thousands of years.</p><p>Unless Master Ning possessed extraordinary abilities to allow Liuli to break through at will.</p><p>“Because you are here, Qin Shijun,” Master Ning said, “This is no longer the best time for a breakthrough!”</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled and patiently listened to Master Ning continue.</p><p>“I know of a special secret realm; it is a great opportunity for Liuli.  Breaking through within that realm would be incredibly beneficial.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I have a vow that prevents me from entering it personally. For her to successfully enter, Liuli would have to break through prematurely, only gaining a portion of the benefits. Your appearance, Qin Shijun, provides another possibility.</p><p>“Liao Chen and the others cannot help Liuli; only you can, because in critical moments, you remain the most trustworthy person in her instincts.”</p><p>Master Ning paused, then continued, “I don't know the depth of your feelings for Liuli, nor will I force you to help her every time. You are still far from the Unity and Mahayana stages; no one knows what the future holds. Consider this a request from her master; this journey will also benefit you. In addition, you can witness Liuli's breakthrough firsthand. If you see anything inconsistent with my words, you can stop her!”</p><p>Master Ning’s tone was earnest.</p><p>Qin Sang felt slightly relieved.  After meeting, although Master Ning hadn't used a harsh tone, an invisible pressure still lingered in the gazebo.</p><p>If Master Ning adopts a condescending attitude, even if Qin Sang wants to help Liu Li, she will suspect his ulterior motives and refuse to be led by the nose.  Even if she is currently weak, she will find a way to take Liu Li away later.</p><p>At least from this conversation, Master Ning does seem somewhat like a "master."</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal and asked, "Where is this sacred realm?"</p><p>"Within the Yi Ren's sacred grounds!"  Master Ning replied.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.  Master Ning continued, "My earlier words weren't false.  Mount Taiyu can indeed be repaired, but it requires finding a similar sacred mountain."</p><p>"Mount Yuanjiao?"</p><p>"Correct," Master Ning nodded.  "In ancient times, five sacred mountains were renowned. Entering the sacred grounds and absorbing Mount Yuanjiao's essence will help Qin Shijun quickly repair Mount Taiyu."</p><p>Knowing the method to repair the sacred mountain, Qin Sang felt no joy. He didn't know what exactly sacred mountain essence was, but he knew Mount Yuanjiao was the cornerstone of the Yi Ren's sacred grounds, a place where powerful cultivators resided.  Stealing Mount Yuanjiao's essence, if sensed by those powerful cultivators, would be suicidal!</p><p>"Qin Shijun, rest assured. I have a way for you to absorb the mountain's essence undetected.  Even if the current Mount Taiyu absorbs it freely, compared to the entire Mount Yuanjiao, it's insignificant. The Yi Ren's powerful cultivators won't pay attention to such a small change,"</p><p>Master Ning said confidently. "The sacred grounds are vast and complex, inevitably with some vulnerabilities where the mountain's essence spills out.  There is one such place in the sacred realm I mentioned, therefore helping Liu Li is also helping Qin Shijun."</p><p>"How can we, as outsiders, enter the Yi Ren's sacred grounds? And if I remember correctly, Yi Ren cultivators must reach the Void Realm, second stage, to be eligible to enter."</p><p>Years ago, Si Lu also tried to use this condition to persuade Qin Sang, but Qin Sang never took it seriously. The sacred grounds are shared by all Yi Ren tribes; the rules are established, and even the Si Huang has no power to make the tribes violate their ancestral traditions.</p><p>"Don't worry about Liu Li's cultivation. I'll use a Celestial Emperor Control Talisman to enhance her beforehand. Before the talisman's power dissipates, she can disguise herself as a Nascent Soul cultivator and possess the corresponding strength," Master Ning explained.</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Celestial Emperor Control... could it refer to Gou Chen, one of the Four Heavenly Emperors of the Dao Court?</p><p>Master Ning chuckled lightly. "Qin Shijun, don't you think only the Talisman Sect understands talisman techniques and summoning gods? In ancient times, the Talisman Sect created the Divine Court, following the entire Daoist canon. The names of the gods are ancient! My Celestial Emperor Control Talisman is very different from the Talisman Sect's, and its quality is only considered low-grade; otherwise, Liu Li couldn't withstand the talisman's power. As for the eligibility to enter the sacred grounds, Ziyun Mountain and the Yuanxiang Clan leader have a prior agreement. It was originally for Liao Chen and Liu Li, so I've given it to Qin Shijun."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted.  "Outsiders can enter the sacred grounds?"</p><p>"When the Yi Ren found Mount Yuanjiao and created the sacred grounds with the entire tribe's efforts, they almost failed and had to rely on outside help. After the sacred grounds were built, a rule was established: outsiders, as long as they obtain the recognition of a whole Upper Tribe's Mirage Pavilion Master, can have the same eligibility as the Yi Ren, but only as attendants..."</p><p>Master Ning explained, "However, over the years, very few outsiders have qualified. Many Upper Tribes have forgotten this rule."</p><p>"In that case, I have an idea. If it works, we won't need Liao Chen's quota..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, briefly explaining his battle with the Si You Clan.</p><p>The Si Huang likely has a way to persuade the other Mirage Pavilion Masters.  One Mirage Pavilion for a quota – I wonder if the Si Huang would be interested.</p><p>In the Yi Ren's sacred grounds, the more experts on our side, the better.</p><p>Also, the trip to the sacred grounds is a rare opportunity. If both of Ziyun Mountain's quotas are taken by him and Liu Li, even if Liao Chen doesn't mind, it will cause discontent among the monks of Ziyun Mountain.</p><p>Master Ning was overjoyed. "Excellent! Liao Chen is from Ziyun Mountain, and Liu Li has the Celestial Emperor Control Talisman; neither can hide their identities. Qin Shijun can hide in the shadows, making it easier to act."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.  "Does Master Ning have enemies in the sacred grounds?"</p><p>Master Ning sighed. "Originally from the same origin, but because of different Daoist ideals, we are estranged. The atmosphere in the Yi Ren's sacred grounds encourages infighting; you are destined not to coexist peacefully. However, their allies are from the Water Tribe, and they should not know about Qin Shijun's existence; you may not meet in the sacred grounds."</p><p>It's good that the opponent isn't one of the powerful outsiders from the Sacred Land. Qin Sang nodded. "When will the Sacred Land open?"</p><p>"The Evil River has minor and major tides.  Each time the major tide recedes, the Sacred Land opens. The timing is unpredictable. My calculations suggest the next major recession will be within a millennium."</p><p>Master Ning looked at Qin Sang. "Have you accepted, Qin?"</p><p>"I want to see Liuli!"</p><p>Qin Sang met Master Ning's gaze without flinching. "Master Ning won't stop me, will you?"</p><p>Master Ning smiled slightly, gesturing vaguely towards the pavilion. "Liuli's abode is on Jade Peak."</p><p>Qin Sang received directions to Jade Peak, bowed slightly to Master Ning, and flew from the pavilion.</p><p>"Master Ning..."</p><p>The old nun watched Qin Sang's back, her face filled with worry.</p><p>Master Ning shook his head gently. "Qin is not one to act rashly. You should return; don't disturb them."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The three exchanged glances and bowed, retreating.</p><p>...</p><p>Flying from the main peak of Purple Cloud Mountain, Qin Sang passed numerous smaller peaks until he saw a unique one.</p><p>The peak stood alone, far from its neighbors, almost perfectly vertical on all sides, sheer cliffs with no stone steps, only clinging vines and pines offering a way to climb.  The summit was snow-covered, desolate and magnificent!</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang saw a stone mansion under the snow, a figure standing before it.</p><p>The figure was Liuli, blending seamlessly with the cold environment!</p><p>In flowing white robes, her beauty was breathtaking. Her long, black hair flowed freely, dancing in the cold wind.</p><p>Nearly a millennium had passed since they last met.</p><p>Their eyes met, and Qin Sang's heart stirred. He gently landed before Liuli.</p><p>"Master said a former acquaintance would visit. It is Daoist Qin," Liuli bowed first and spoke.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. He'd grown accustomed to Liuli's silence.</p><p>Liuli's demeanor remained cool and distant, but the stubbornness in her eyes was gone. Or perhaps she had forgotten her 'troubles,' no longer burdened by struggle, no longer needing to project that 'stubbornness.'</p><p>The Liuli before him felt unfamiliar.</p><p>Was this her true nature, suppressed all along?  Was forgetting everything a form of liberation?</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed his thoughts, returned the bow, hesitated, then said, "Thank you, Fairy. During my absence, you protected Qingyang Temple and even commissioned a statue of me, greatly benefiting my cultivation."</p><p>"Daoist Qin led away the great calamity, benefiting the world. These were our duties,"</p><p>Liuli said calmly, pointing to a nearby stone pavilion. "Please, have a seat."</p><p>A pot of tea sat within, and Liuli poured a cup for Qin Sang with delicate hands—unimaginable before.</p><p>They spoke of the past like old friends who shared experiences yet had never truly known each other. Liuli seemed an observer, her tone even and unemotional.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully avoided mentioning their deeply painful shared history.  He wondered if Liuli had forgotten those events, or simply forgotten her feelings for him, able to remain calm and unaffected.</p><p>Master Ning's warning echoed in his ears.  Qin Sang dared not gamble; he didn't know how Liuli would react to such sensitive topics.</p><p>It was hard to believe Liuli remembered yet was unmoved.</p><p>The tea was finished, and Qin Sang didn't know what it tasted like.  He sighed inwardly and rose. "The Storm Realm needs rebuilding; I can't stay long. I must go."</p><p>Liuli rose. "With Daoist Qin's return, the Storm Realm should be safe."</p><p>Qin Sang waited, but Liuli made no further gesture. He flew from Jade Peak, glancing back.</p><p>The pavilion was empty. Liuli had entered her abode, her back disappearing into the shadows.</p><p>Only after the door closed did Qin Sang turn, flying back to the main peak.  Master Ning waited.</p><p>"Did you see Liuli, Qin?"</p><p>Qin Sang produced an item and gave it to Master Ning.</p><p>Master Ning took it—a red cord holding a small, square wooden tag, smooth and unadorned.  He was surprised. "This is... Soul-Nurturing Wood!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He’d received a piece of Soul-Nurturing Wood from Bai, refined most of it, and made the tag for emergencies.</p><p>He’d long wanted to give a piece to Liuli, but she’d been so wary, she wouldn't have accepted it.</p><p>When he'd given her the Heavenly Exquisite Jade and Spirit-Calming Incense, he'd considered giving it then, but those were consumables; the Soul-Nurturing Wood was a keepsake.</p><p>He hadn't known what to inscribe on it. He'd hoped to do so when she agreed—the perfect moment.</p><p>He didn't know if he'd ever have another chance.</p><p>Master Ning held the Soul-Nurturing Wood tag.  "I'll give it to her."</p><p>"Farewell!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed and vanished in a streak of light.</p>
