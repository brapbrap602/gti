<h1>Chapter 396: Corpse Transformation</h1><p>Qin Sang split off a portion of the Nine Nether Demon Flames to block the Skyfiend.</p><p>At the same time, fearing Yu Hua might still have the strength to retaliate, Qin Sang urged the remaining flames to completely destroy Yu Hua's Ten Yama Formation. After confirming Yu Hua was unconscious and unable to resist, Qin Sang flew over to him, sealed his energy center, and cast a restrictive spell, turning Yu Hua into a living corpse embryo before storing him in his Corpse Puppet Pouch.</p><p>Having lost its target, the Skyfiend looked puzzled, then vanished on the spot, returning to its lair.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the scattered Five Elements Swords and pointed them at the barrier.</p><p>He chose not to exit the Ice Palace.</p><p>First, he was unsure what the Swarmfish Dragons would do after their nest was destroyed, whether they would leave the deep pool or not. If he encountered them in the passage, in his current state, even escaping would be difficult.</p><p>Second, he feared Yu Hua might have accomplices waiting outside.</p><p>On the other hand, the space behind the barrier was a rare safe haven, guarded by the Skyfiend.</p><p>The logical course of action was to recover from his injuries first, then find a way to leave.</p><p>After teleporting into the Ice Palace, Qin Sang immediately collapsed.</p><p>Reflecting on his recent experiences, from helping Yun Youzi delay the Skyfiend to encountering and ultimately killing Yu Hua, it hadn't actually been that long. Yet, not only was he covered in injuries, but his mind had also been constantly tense, without a moment's respite.</p><p>All he wanted now was to fall into a deep sleep and forget everything.</p><p>But he couldn't.</p><p>Qin Sang forced himself up, supporting his body with his arms. Suddenly, he hissed, his face contorted in pain. His upper body bent like a shrimp as he clutched his core, gritting his teeth to endure.</p><p>Cold sweat dripped onto the ground, freezing into icy beads.</p><p>The slightest movement sent a searing pain through his energy center.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang felt slightly better. Inspecting his internal condition, he saw the depletion of his vital essence and the ravaged state of his energy center and meridians. He couldn't help but smile bitterly.</p><p>After encountering Yu Hua, he had repeatedly overdrawn his energy center, forcefully refining medicinal pills, and even feeding his Ghost with his vital essence. Although he had found an opportunity to consume healing elixirs, he had still suffered considerable damage.</p><p>Now, he was even more severely injured, his energy center and meridians in a disastrous state.</p><p>Even with elixirs, it would likely take time for him to fully recover, requiring a period of careful nurturing.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, took out a bottle of elixirs, and swallowed a few. The pills transformed into a cool medicinal force, circulating through his meridians and beginning to heal his injuries.</p><p>After a brief period of meditation, Qin Sang awoke from his trance and looked at Yu Hua. He gathered some icy water and splashed it on Yu Hua's face.</p><p>Yu Hua shuddered, waking from his unconsciousness.</p><p>"It's you..."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Yu Hua's expression changed drastically. He immediately realized his predicament and tried to struggle, but found his entire body bound, his spiritual power sealed, rendering him as helpless as a mortal.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yu Hua quickly regained his composure, earning Qin Sang's grudging admiration.</p><p>"Zhao Yan's death was not in vain!"</p><p>Yu Hua, though defeated, remained defiant. His gaze was dark as he stared at Qin Sang. "Back at the Yuanzhao Sect, your cultivation was only at the Qi Refining stage, right?  Just after Yi Tiannie planted the Heart-Eating Insect in you, you were sent to the Yuanzhao Sect. How did you resist the insect's control?"</p><p>"You want to know?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was playful. "But I won't tell you!"</p><p>"You!"</p><p>Yu Hua was furious, his face red, his teeth gritted. "Not killing me, do you intend to make me serve you? I advise you to stop dreaming!"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered. "Don't worry, I will give you a quick death! But first, I have some questions for you, then I'll send you on your way."</p><p>Without finishing his sentence, Qin Sang launched the spell from his palm. The Soul Snatching Curse landed on Yu Hua.</p><p>He couldn't be bothered to play games with Yu Hua.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang saw that Yu Hua was already resigned to death.  Against such a cunning old devil, interrogation might not be effective and could even lead to false information, a final trick from Yu Hua before his demise.</p><p>As the Soul Snatching Curse took effect, Yu Hua's eyes became glazed over.  Qin Sang seized the opportunity to interrogate him.</p><p>Yu Hua's cultivation was far higher than his, and the Soul Snatching Curse's duration was limited. Qin Sang prioritized the questions he urgently needed answered.</p><p>The first question was about the method to counteract the Heart-Eating Insect.</p><p>The second question was about the identity, cultivation level, and injury status of the surviving Golden Core cultivator from the Kuiyin Sect, as well as the whereabouts of the remaining Kuiyin Sect remnants.</p><p>Just as he was about to ask the third question, Yu Hua's eyelids suddenly fluttered, and his soul began to rapidly decay.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned deeply.  His divine sense probed Yu Hua's soul space, discovering that his soul was incredibly dim and on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Was this caused by the Nine Nether Demon Flames?</p><p>Yu Hua's soul was deteriorating quickly. Qin Sang raced against time, striking Yu Hua's soul space with the Celestial Corpse Talisman, merging it with Yu Hua's soul.</p><p>If he could successfully induce Yin Sha into the body and transform Yu Hua into a living corpse, Qin Sang would possess an extremely powerful corpse puppet, greatly increasing his strength.</p><p>However, the final step in refining a living corpse was extremely difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. His current cultivation was only at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment realm, and the success rate was likely not very high.  To be safe, it was best to wait until he broke through to the late-stage Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p>Holding Yu Hua in his hand, Qin Sang stared at Yu Hua's neck, his brow suddenly furrowing.  An inexplicable urge arose from within him, a craving for vital essence, almost instinctive...</p><p>Qin Sang raised his arm and examined it.  His skin was unnaturally pale, devoid of any color, and he felt a faint chill within his body.</p><p>These descriptions were all mentioned in Wu Shang's letter, the effects of corpse transformation.</p><p>However, Wu Shang didn't have the Jade Buddha and was controlled by the Celestial Corpse Talisman. His urges were much stronger than Qin Sang's, requiring him to constantly consume the vital essence of cultivators to barely resist the transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled, his face calm.</p><p>The moment the Celestial Corpse Talisman touched his soul, he was absolutely certain that if he willed it, he could use the Jade Buddha to remove the talisman from his soul.</p><p>After removing the talisman, the corpse transformation should stop. If Wu Shang hadn't lied in his letter, the corpse refining restrictions, modified by him, had a way to be reversed.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't entirely sure. If he used the corpse path to condense a Corpse Core, the degree of corpse transformation would be profound.  After transforming into a Skyfiend, even if he removed the Celestial Corpse Talisman, could he still reverse the process and return to normal?</p><p>"This path, unless absolutely necessary, is best avoided."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>Within his soul space, Qin Sang 'saw' the Heart-Eating Insect clinging to his soul.  From Yu Hua, he had learned the secret method to counteract the insect's control.</p><p>However, Qin Sang suddenly didn't want to remove it.</p><p>Combined with the complete poison control method and the Void Spirit Seal, he could minimize the Heart-Eating Insect's fluctuations to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>From Yu Hua, Qin Sang gleaned a great deal of information.</p><p>For example, the surviving Golden Core cultivator from the Kuiyin Sect was at the early Golden Core stage and was hiding near Green Sun City, his injuries severe and still unrecovered.</p><p>The Kuiyin Sect remnants gathered under this person's command were now operating under the alias "Demonflame," constantly searching for healing elixirs.</p><p>Qin Sang silently activated the secret method, using the Void Spirit Seal to suppress the Heart-Eating Insect.</p>
