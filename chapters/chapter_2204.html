<h1>Chapter 2194: Nine Turns Annihilation Wind</h1><p>Hearing Qin Sang's shout, the man in green retreated even faster, further confirming Qin Sang's suspicions.</p><p>The Yi people's cultivators were all blocked outside by two Saint Realm powerhouses. Those who dared to remain near the Heart Lake under the pressure of two Saint Realm powerhouses either possessed incredible abilities or had some kind of backing.</p><p>This person likely had a similar background to the Celestial Child, or perhaps was even a helper summoned by the Celestial Child! Otherwise, with his clearly superior cultivation and lack of injuries, why would he react so strangely upon seeing them?</p><p>The man in green ignored them, retreating again and again.</p><p>His strange behavior put Qin Sang on alert, causing a sense of unease.  Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and he quickly retreated, fully activating his Heavenly Eye ability to perceive his surroundings.  He then transmitted a message to Liuli, "This person is suspicious. Retreat!"</p><p>"You're pretty sharp!"</p><p>The man in green snorted, a smirk playing on his lips as he let out a loud laugh.</p><p>"Haha, Daoist Si has searched for his enemy in vain, but fate is unpredictable, and it has come so easily!"</p><p>The next moment, a deep voice came from afar, "Heh heh, little brother, you should thank us for forcibly bringing you here. Otherwise, wouldn't you have missed this great opportunity?"</p><p>The voice, like rolling thunder, grew closer, shaking the mountains.</p><p>Simultaneously, two streaks of light, one black and one gold, appeared and sped towards them, like shooting stars across the sky.</p><p>They no longer concealed themselves, bursting forth with astonishing power.</p><p>Qin Sang's premonition came true. He saw a delicately crafted child in the golden light and immediately recognized him as the Celestial Child mentioned by Si Lu.</p><p>In fact, even without seeing the Celestial Child's face, Qin Sang could determine his origin, because his aura was very similar to the Grand Protector's, clearly from the same lineage.</p><p>"Three top-tier experts comparable to late Nascent Soul stage!"</p><p>Qin Sang used his Heavenly Eye to its fullest, his heart sinking slightly, yet tinged with regret.</p><p>The enemy's strength didn't exceed his expectations by much.  He and Liuli, along with a Thunder Beast Guard, would not be too fearful of a direct confrontation. If the ambush had succeeded, there was a good chance of killing the Celestial Child.</p><p>Yet, fate was unpredictable. Not only did the enemy not fall into the trap, they actually encountered them here.</p><p>This encounter was completely unexpected. Qin Sang and Liuli had been on guard against other Daoist disciples, pondering how to proceed in the secret realm, collecting the essence of the Immortal Mountain, and helping Liuli safely overcome her tribulation.</p><p>This showed that the Yi cultivator's appearance here was no accident. Something must have happened here to draw the Celestial Child and his companions, leading to this unexpected encounter.</p><p>The situation was extremely unfavorable. Their path was blocked, and Qin Sang and Liuli could only choose to retreat.</p><p>They landed on the west side of the island and traveled east. The evil wind was moving rapidly towards the northwest, fortunately giving them a path of retreat. They flew west, skirting the edge of the evil wind.</p><p>"Please help me, two Daoist friends, to obliterate this person and offer him as a sacrifice to my senior brother's spirit in heaven!"</p><p>The Celestial Child's voice was as childish as his appearance, but the deep-seated hatred distorted his tone, like a demon's howl, chilling one to the bone.</p><p>"Certainly! Certainly! If we couldn't find this person, it would be that, but since he's come to us, how could we let him go?"</p><p>The man in green switched from retreating to chasing, laughing sinisterly, then his expression changed.  "This person's escape technique is truly remarkable!"</p><p>Two streaks of light merged into one, transforming into a green lightning bolt that pierced through space and instantly vanished into the sky.</p><p>Even with someone else, the thunder escape technique displayed extreme speed.</p><p>Earlier, when the man in green suddenly encountered Qin Sang and Liuli, he had the chance to hold them off and wait for his companions. The three of them had previously decided to investigate separately; they had encountered the evil wind along the way and were not far apart.</p><p>But the other party had the impressive feat of killing the Grand Protector and wiping out the entire Lu family, and was even treated as a distinguished guest by Emperor Si.  They were clearly not ordinary individuals.</p><p>The Celestial Child insisted that Qin Sang relied on an altar and that the rest were insignificant, but the man in green wouldn't completely believe him.  Moreover, Qin Sang had another helper whose strength was unknown, although his surface cultivation was not high.</p><p>He was not the victim, nor did he have a life-or-death friendship with the Celestial Child. He only came to help because the Celestial Child had paid him, and he was unwilling to take risks. Therefore, his first reaction upon seeing Qin Sang was to retreat, only starting to pursue them after his companions arrived.</p><p>The Celestial Child knew his intentions and couldn't blame him.  It is always easier to add flowers to a blossoming scene than to send coals in snowy weather. However, once they gained the upper hand, this person would still contribute.</p><p>As the green lightning was about to disappear into the thick fog, the black-robed cultivator and the man in green pursued relentlessly.</p><p>The man in green was not adept at flight, so he quickly fell behind, widening the distance between himself and the black-robed cultivator.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator's robe billowed, like a black shadow engulfing him. From his back, the shadow gradually extended, transforming into a pair of charcoal-black wings.</p><p>A dark feather fluttered, seeming to become a black hole, drawing in all surrounding light.  Instantly, darkness fell.  Then, a shadow in the darkness rapidly elongated, like an infinitely extending thread, the darkness swiftly encroaching forward as the thread lengthened.</p><p>Two invited helpers pursued with all their might.  Oddly, Xian Tong's escape speed slowed.</p><p>"Qi, Tang, don't let him get away! I'll break his Thunder Escape technique first," Xian Tong transmitted his voice, his right palm rising, a gourd appearing in his palm.  The gourd, smoothly rounded and made of black jade, was slightly smaller than his hand – small and charming.</p><p>To kill Qin Sang, they had to capture him first.  They had to counter his Thunder Escape technique. Xian Tong had made multiple preparations, the Xuan Shen Nine-Splendor Array being one.</p><p>Furthermore, in case Qin Sang saw through the trap, he had a way to stop him: the black jade gourd. This treasure, a spiritual treasure called the Extinction Ember Gourd, could unleash a Nine-Turn Extinction Ember Wind, combining wind and fire, capable of countering thunder techniques.  Once caught in the wind, even Qin Sang's powerful Thunder Escape technique would be significantly hampered.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't own the treasure; he'd borrowed it at great cost. The gourd's owner naturally wouldn't teach him the treasure's secret techniques, instead using a special secret method to allow Xian Tong temporary use.  He could only activate it three times. But if used correctly, three times would be enough to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>Xian Tong focused his mind, and the Extinction Ember Gourd flew to his head. Four streams of light flew out from his brow, four companion beasts forming a ring.</p><p>He'd been diligently familiarizing himself with the gourd.  Since it wasn't his, using it wasn't as effortless as if it were.  And Qin Sang's escape speed demonstrated his profound mastery of thunder. Everything in the universe has its counter; to counter this, Xian Tong focused most of his attention on activating the gourd to unleash the full power of the Nine-Turn Extinction Ember Wind!</p><p>The Extinction Ember Gourd hung high in the sky.  A dark glow flashed on its surface.  Its mouth aimed at Qin Sang and Liuli's escape route, a black vortex appearing, seeming to contain endless darkness.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The Extinction Ember Gourd blew out streams of black energy.  These fine black currents rapidly faded after leaving the gourd, eventually disappearing completely.</p><p>The gourd rotated; the black energy intensified with each turn. The wind howled, growing stronger.</p><p>The moment the Nine-Turn Extinction Ember Wind was unleashed, others sensed something amiss.  Qin Sang felt a sense of foreboding.  He and Liuli fled without looking back, seemingly in a panic, but they didn't unleash their Thunder Beast Guard.</p><p>The moment he identified them, Qin Sang knew this wouldn't end well. While fleeing, his mind raced; he even considered counterattacking Xian Tong.</p><p>There were only three enemies. If Liuli unleashed the Heavenly Emperor's Strategy Talisman, did they have a chance?  The enemy had the advantage of numbers; they had the records of this secret realm, even if many were outdated, providing some geographical advantage.</p><p>As Qin Sang secretly plotted, a sudden warning flared in his heart. He looked up.</p><p>Thick fog was everywhere, obscuring the sky and sun, but above, dark clouds had appeared, not rain falling from them, but black flames and strange winds.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>'Whoosh!'…</p><p>Wind and fire filled the heavens, howling, the sudden display almost matching the previous evil wind in power.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could react, they were enveloped by wind and fire.  There was nowhere to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was grim. The wind and fire didn't bring immediate danger; it wasn't soul-consuming infernal fire.  But instantly, his Thunder Escape technique strangely faltered.</p><p>It wasn't a problem with his technique, but a force pervading the area, repelling and countering thunder power, as if the thunder was unwelcome in this region of wind and fire! This force wasn't enough to suppress the Azure Luan True Thunder, but Qin Sang hadn't fully refined the Azure Luan True Thunder; he was only using its power superficially.</p><p>The slightest delay in the process would affect his lightning techniques, something unavoidable in the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind.</p><p>If not for the Azure Luan True Lightning, the limitations on his lightning techniques would be even greater.  Though he hadn't tried, Qin Sang guessed that unless he escaped this wind and fire, other lightning spells would be severely weakened, even impacting the power of his Thunder Beast Guards.</p><p>The opponent was clearly prepared, having anticipated countermeasures.  In this situation, seeking a counterattack didn't seem wise.</p><p>At that moment, the pursuing forces behind them noticed the strange happenings.</p><p>Seeing the azure lightning's glow subtly dim, the black-robed cultivator was delighted, increasing his speed.</p><p>His escape technique had nothing to do with the way of thunder, and the Immortal Child hadn't targeted him, so he remained unaffected.</p><p>As he rapidly closed in, darkness and fire merged, amplifying the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind's power.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>Wind and fire surrounded them, the azure lightning seemingly sinking into a mire, while the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind grew stronger.</p><p>Sensing the pursuer's approach, Qin Sang's eyes flashed as he glanced behind him.</p><p>Although the black-robed cultivator's escape technique wasn't as powerful as the lightning technique infused with Azure Luan True Lightning, it was still remarkable – something he'd never seen before.</p><p>He wondered if the man was deliberately concealing his background.  Always shrouded in his black robe, his origins remained unclear.  Only the black wings on his back suggested a possible connection to the Feather Clan or a related group.</p><p>His thoughts racing, Qin Sang knew he couldn't let the man get any closer.  With a flick of his sleeve, he shot out a golden ray.</p><p>The ray transformed mid-air into a golden lock – the Heavenly Binding Lock he'd seized from the Grand Devotee.  Qin Sang launched it at the black-robed cultivator, unleashing the full power of his Void Domain.</p><p>Given the relationship between the Immortal Child and the Grand Devotee, the latter’s possession of this treasure must have been known. Since a surprise attack was impossible, he might as well use it openly; perhaps it could drive the opponent back.</p><p>Seeing the Heavenly Binding Lock and the spreading Void Domain, the black-robed cultivator remained calm, coldly sneering, "I knew you'd use that!"</p><p>From his chest, a green light flew out – a piece of azure bark, thin as paper, slightly curled, with clearly visible patterns.</p><p>Its origin was unknown, but the patterns looked both naturally grown and artificially etched, the more one looked, the more profound it appeared.</p><p>The azure bark erupted in a burst of green light, then disintegrated along the patterns, countless thin azure threads drifting toward the black-robed cultivator.</p><p>Simultaneously, a strange energy appeared.</p><p>This treasure was a unique type of spirit talisman, only the medium was different; it was meticulously crafted from the bark of a specific spirit tree – a method quite prevalent among the 異人族 (Yi Ren).</p><p>This was also the Immortal Child’s precaution against Qin Sang refining the Heavenly Binding Lock, providing it to the black-robed cultivator in advance.</p><p>The Heavenly Binding Lock had originally been taken from the Sacred Land by the Grand Devotee, so the Immortal Child naturally knew how to counter it.</p><p>The azure threads touched his black robe, clinging to it, taking root, absorbing nutrients, and rapidly thickening, sprouting new buds and branches. In an instant, the black-robed cultivator was surrounded by dense vines, like wearing heavy wooden armor, but without hindering his combat abilities.</p><p>Next, a crimson hue appeared among the vines, a flower bud blooming.</p><p>The vibrant flower, like embroidery on the wooden armor, seemed sentient, its red center like an eye, always locked onto the Heavenly Binding Lock in the sky, regardless of movement.</p><p>*Clang clang clang…*</p><p>Locked by the flower, the Heavenly Binding Lock malfunctioned, disturbed by an invisible force and becoming unstable.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly cursed, frantically trying to stabilize the lock, but ripples inevitably appeared in the Void Domain.</p><p>In combat, this was enough to create a weakness.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator flapped his wings several times, his figure like a ghost, instantly weaving through the shimmering golden light of the Void Domain several times, each time precisely at the point of greatest fluctuation – a perilous maneuver. He passed through the Void Domain unscathed!</p><p>The initial attack failed. Qin Sang's expression darkened, but he remained undeterred and unsurprised. Using the Heavenly Binding Lock was a test; better to try it now than have it countered during a critical moment.</p>
