<h1>Chapter 1301: The Rescue</h1><p>In the void, a kaleidoscope of seven-colored lights intertwined, obscuring all else. This was the manifestation of a restrictive formation, not only blocking sight but also possessing formidable power. Qin Sang, standing within the formation, felt as though he had entered a world of neon.</p><p>"There!" Qin Sang pointed toward a cluster of purple light ahead and sent his sword flying toward it.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A mysterious pagoda responded, flying over the purple light and casting a shadow of itself before slamming down!</p><p>The sword and pagoda arrived simultaneously.</p><p>The purple light shattered.</p><p>The rainbow hues dissipated, and the scenery before them abruptly changed—they had broken through another layer of the formation. At the same time, Qin Sang's instincts flared, and he deftly dodged in all directions.</p><p>In the next moment, a tidal wave of attacks surged toward him.</p><p>Blades and swords flashed, and countless Daoist techniques filled the air.</p><p>Individually, none of these attacks would have fazed Qin Sang, but with the formation's amplification, he had no choice but to evade their combined force.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Tortoise Shell Shield, positioning it in front of him.</p><p>'Thud! Thud! Thud!'</p><p>The shield trembled as it blocked all incoming attacks.</p><p>At that moment, both Qin Sang and Qing Jun received a message from Elder Zhenyi. Despite the enemy's onslaught, they flickered through the formation, eventually finding the elder.</p><p>Tongyou Demon Lord had arrived even faster.</p><p>Once everyone had gathered, Elder Zhenyi urgently spoke, "I've just received word. Our mole attempted to sabotage the city's defenders and shut down the protective formation but was exposed and is now being hunted. The other fellow Daoists will stay here to hold the formation. Please follow me to assist him. He holds a high position and knows the secrets of the Sin Abyss intimately. We cannot afford to lose him!"</p><p>"Elder, is the mole you planted in the Sin Abyss truly a Nascent Soul expert?" Qin Sang couldn't help but ask.</p><p>Only a Nascent Soul expert could carry out such tasks and escape unscathed after being exposed. No wonder Elder Zhenyi's intelligence was so precise—he had even managed to recruit a Nascent Soul expert!</p><p>Elder Zhenyi nodded.</p><p>"At this point, there's no need to hide it. The one who infiltrated the Sin Abyss is none other than Fellow Daoist Qu Huan. Years ago, I secretly sent a group of disciples to the Sin Abyss, infiltrating various sects. Qu Huan was the most deeply hidden among them. I never expected that, despite the immense pressure and humiliation of being in enemy territory, he would manage to break through to the Nascent Soul stage."</p><p>"It's him!" Tongyou Demon Lord frowned deeply. "I never would have guessed he had such a connection with you, Elder. One of my disciples was killed by Qu Huan, his body and soul utterly destroyed!"</p><p>Elder Zhenyi's expression remained unchanged. "Fellow Daoist Qu Huan had no choice. Every move he made was under constant surveillance, and the slightest misstep could have exposed him. I would never have contacted this mole unless absolutely necessary, or else he wouldn't have been able to remain hidden under Old Demon Ye's nose for so long. The intelligence Qu Huan provided has always been crucial. For instance, if not for him, we would have only received vague information by now and would have just set out from Stone Quarry City."</p><p>Tongyou Demon Lord snorted. "Of course, I understand the gravity of the situation. If Qu Huan has indeed contributed greatly, then that matter will be forgotten!"</p><p>That disciple had been Tongyou Demon Lord's most valued, and his death on the battlefield due to a moment of carelessness had left a lasting impression. However, compared to Qu Huan's secrets, this grudge was insignificant.</p><p>After a brief discussion, the four of them flickered through the formation, disappearing into its depths.</p><p>...</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A protective treasure shattered.</p><p>Qu Huan staggered, his face flushing unnaturally as he suppressed the backlash. He had no time to mourn the loss of the treasure, his expression filled with urgency as he flew outward, cursing inwardly that the rescue team had yet to arrive.</p><p>Though he had taken precautions, being pursued by so many had left him nearly out of options.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A chilling wind swept toward him, and Qu Huan felt a cold sensation on his back. Without hesitation, he flung out a spirit talisman.</p><p>The talisman shattered, releasing a burst of green light that transformed into a massive green bell, enveloping Qu Huan entirely.</p><p>In the next moment, a skull materialized within the chilling wind, its jaws opening wide as it lunged at Qu Huan, only to clamp down on the bell. A deafening 'clang' echoed as the skull was repelled, howling in pain and disorientation.</p><p>Qu Huan, however, showed no sign of relief. This was his last protective treasure. If the talisman's power ran out before the rescue team arrived, his situation would become dire.</p><p>The skull wailed as it flew back into the sleeve of a tall, thin cultivator.</p><p>"After him!"</p><p>Old Freak Feng and the others arrived, preparing to encircle Qu Huan, when a ripple suddenly appeared above them. Thousands of silver threads rained down like a storm.</p><p>"Be careful! It's Elder Zhenyi's Thousand Jade Horsetail Whisk!"</p><p>The tall, thin cultivator exclaimed in alarm.</p><p>At the same time, they heard the rumble of thunder and the whistle of a sword. On one side, dark lightning erupted, while on the other, a sword streaked across the sky like a meteor.</p><p>Amidst the silver threads, the shadow of a pagoda flickered.</p><p>"The Five Directions Pagoda, the Dark Lightning Gourd, the Ebony Sword..."</p><p>Old Freak Feng gasped. After years of warfare, they were all too familiar with these treasures and their owners.</p><p>The four great experts of the Two Realms Alliance had arrived!</p><p>Seeing this, they knew it was impossible to kill Qu Huan in front of these four. They decisively abandoned the pursuit, flickering away to return to the city.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The silver threads twisted, aiming for Old Freak Feng.</p><p>Elder Zhenyi sought to seize the opportunity to capture one of them, and Qin Sang and the others, understanding his intent, directed their treasures toward Old Freak Feng, coordinating with the Thousand Jade Horsetail Whisk to subdue him.</p><p>Old Freak Feng's instincts screamed, and his demonic form tensed.</p><p>In the next moment, a massive demonic shadow emerged from his body, roaring furiously at the sky. The Thousand Jade Horsetail Whisk only ensnared the shadow.</p><p>The others reacted swiftly, summoning their treasures to counterattack and rescue Old Freak Feng, retreating back to Valley City.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qing Jun seemed to notice something, a hint of confusion crossing his face.</p><p>"What is it?" Qin Sang turned to ask.</p><p>Qing Jun stared at Old Freak Feng's retreating figure. "Old Freak Feng seems... off. I've fought him before, but his cultivation seems to have regressed rather than advanced... he's weaker."</p><p>"Perhaps he was injured during the siege against Old Demon Ye," Qin Sang speculated.</p><p>"It doesn't seem like it," Qing Jun slowly shook his head.</p><p>The battle had ended as quickly as it began, with neither side suffering significant losses. But they all knew that the most brutal battles were yet to come.</p><p>Having driven off the pursuers, Qin Sang and the others immediately turned to meet Qu Huan. They had too many questions and curiosities about this sudden turn of events, and only Qu Huan could provide the answers.</p><p>"Thank you, fellow Daoists, for your assistance."</p><p>Qu Huan, now safe, breathed a sigh of relief and clasped his hands in gratitude.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qu Huan has rendered great service. Naturally, we cannot allow a meritorious hero to come to harm! Welcome back, Fellow Daoist Qu Huan!" Elder Zhenyi stroked his long beard, a hint of pride in his tone.</p><p>A mole planted years ago, thought to have gone rogue, had unexpectedly proven to be such a powerful asset.</p><p>The group exchanged greetings with Qu Huan, all familiar faces who had even crossed swords on the battlefield before, so no further introductions were needed.</p><p>Now that they were all allies, past grievances were naturally set aside.</p><p>Without delay, they eagerly began to voice their questions.</p>
