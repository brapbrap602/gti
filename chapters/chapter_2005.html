<h1>Chapter 1996: Azure Essence</h1><p>Without unnecessary movements, Qin Sang drew upon the ambient spiritual energy, gathering it around her body.  The fierce winds were unable to affect her in the slightest.</p><p>Passing through the gale, they found themselves in a breathtaking azure expanse—a scene of unusual calm for this realm.  There were no hurricanes, no torrential rain; it was as if a blue star illuminated the space.  It also resembled the inside of an ice crystal, dreamlike and ethereal.</p><p>However, appearances were deceiving. The gale still existed, even more terrifying than before. Its extreme condensation had caused a transformation; it had become an invisible wind, capable of killing unseen.</p><p>Around each of them, strange lights flickered as their protective auras clashed violently with the formless gale.  The scene was identical in all directions.</p><p>The invisible gale formed a barrier. As the four penetrated deeper, the area became even calmer, almost deathly silent.</p><p>Finally, they discovered something beyond the gale: a tiny, insignificant blue glimmer.</p><p>Master Yu acted swiftly, reaching out to grasp the glimmer. It shot towards him, landing in his palm—a small piece of ice.</p><p>It was no larger than a pinprick; "ice shard" would be a more fitting description.  And it wasn't actually ice, but something similar.</p><p>"It's Skybright Jade!"</p><p>Old Man Gu recognized the "ice shard."</p><p>The image of this spiritual material flashed through Qin Sang's mind. Skybright Jade is a type of spiritual jade, usable as a material for refining artifacts or as a medicinal ingredient to moderate certain properties. Its versatility makes it not particularly rare in the cultivation world, yet its price remains high.</p><p>"There must be more inside!" Master Yu declared, gazing into the depths of the gale.</p><p>This was a characteristic of Skybright Jade: its presence was subtle, but once a piece was found, a large quantity was sure to be nearby.</p><p>It was likely that a jade mine had formed within the Celestial Sea Eye.</p><p>The four continued inward, indeed finding numerous glittering blue lights drifting within the gale.  They were all Skybright Jade, of varying sizes.  Ignoring the fragments, the four pressed on, eventually sighting a deep, intense blue light.</p><p>They had found a blue mirror, reflecting their images—a massive block of Skybright Jade.</p><p>This was the core of the Celestial Sea Eye.  The gale had abruptly vanished, undergoing a strange transformation that had given birth to and accumulated Skybright Jade over many years, resulting in an astonishing quantity.</p><p>"A veritable jade mine!"</p><p>Master Yu exclaimed joyfully, flying towards the Skybright Jade and touching its surface. His delight intensified.  "At the very least, it's high-grade Skybright Jade; top-grade pieces are also numerous.  A jade mine of this quality is rare even in the Great Thousand Worlds."</p><p>Master Ying circled the jade mine, shaking his head.  "Master Yu is correct, but while Skybright Jade is excellent, we cannot harvest too much at once."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Master Yu's expression shifted slightly.</p><p>"Master Ying has also noticed that as long as the Celestial Sea Eye persists, the Skybright Jade will regenerate.  A steady stream," Old Man Gu tapped the edge of the jade mine with his purple bamboo staff. "Regardless of how the Skybright Jade originally formed, over time, the mine has become part of the Celestial Sea Eye.  Exhaustion of the mine would lead to its collapse, the loss of this treasure, and possibly unforeseen changes to the entire Azure Sky Grotto."</p><p>Master Yu, momentarily careless, understood upon hearing this. He marked the jade mine with gestures. "In that case, after careful calculation, the four sects will send someone to harvest a piece at intervals. The Skybright Jade will be distributed according to the previous agreement.  Daoist, what are your thoughts?"</p><p>All eyes turned to Qin Sang, who seemed oddly pensive.</p><p>Qin Sang descended to the very center of the jade mine, crouching and gazing at the Skybright Jade. She extended a finger and gently stroked its surface. The surface, already free of dust, became even purer after her touch, reflecting a strangely vibrant azure glow that vanished the moment her finger left.</p><p>The three exchanged glances, realizing this was no ordinary Skybright Jade mine; there was a deeper mystery, one Qin Sang had discovered.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The jade mine cracked open, the fissure running precisely through the center and rapidly spreading downwards.</p><p>Qin Sang vanished into the crack, followed by the others. They soon reached the end, where they found a space as blue as the sky.</p><p>The space was purer than the Skybright Jade, like flowing soft jade, enveloping streaks of azure light.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>The three who followed were astonished.  Their earlier cursory examination had failed to reveal this hidden space within the jade mine.  Had it not been for Qin Sang, the four sects might not have discovered this for a long time.</p><p>"Bihen Yuanjing!"</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, secretly delighted at this unexpected find.</p><p>"That's it! Pure and flawless, with traces as blue as the jade; this is truly a celestial treasure!  Thanks to the Daoist's sharp eyes. We were all focused on the Kongchen Jade, almost missing the treasure in plain sight."</p><p>Sect Leader Ying exclaimed.</p><p>At this moment, everyone realized that the true treasure nurtured by the Heavenly Sea Eye was the Bihen Yuanjing, with the Kongchen Jade merely a companion gem.</p><p>Normally, the Kongchen Jade and Bihen Yuanjing have nothing in common, but in a fragmented Lesser World, exceptions are to be expected.</p><p>The Bihen Yuanjing is a rare and precious celestial treasure, a material for refining spiritual treasures. For Qin Sang, it has another use.</p><p>It is one of the crucial spiritual materials needed to establish a Daoist altar!</p><p>In particular, the foundations of various altars require a significant amount of Bihen Yuanjing.</p><p>The main altar of Qingyang Temple needs a large quantity of this material!</p><p>Qin Sang turned, bowed to the three, and said, "Three Daoist friends, this Bihen Yuanjing is of great use to me. I hope you will grant me this. I am willing to compensate you elsewhere."</p><p>Before their arrival, the four sects had preliminarily agreed on a distribution plan, with Qingyang Temple receiving the lion's share.</p><p>Qin Sang needed the Bihen Yuanjing; he had to adjust the plan and make concessions.</p><p>He doesn't plan on building an altar immediately, but it's a possibility in the future.</p><p>After settling everything here, he will embark on a journey, traveling the Greater World, seeking old friends, and searching for his own Dao.</p><p>However, if he fails to find his Dao, he cannot remain stagnant. He must continue along the path of the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*.</p><p>To comprehend the Great Slaughter Dao, he might have to descend to the mortal realm again, establish a force, and protect a region.</p><p>A Daoist altar is undoubtedly the best approach.</p><p>His luck won't always be this good— finding Daoist ruins. He'll have to plan the construction of an altar himself.</p><p>He must start preparing now, gathering various spiritual materials, and the Bihen Yuanjing is certainly not to be missed.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou and the others hadn't discovered the Bihen Yuanjing, and he could have waited to retrieve it alone later, but that might create future problems and discord between the four sects.</p><p>He is now acting from the position of a sect leader.</p><p>After he leaves, Qingyang Temple, being weaker, must remain allied with the three major sects.</p><p>The current situation is hard-won. A sect wishing to thrive should act with integrity.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou and the others understood this. Hearing Qin Sang's intention to keep the Bihen Yuanjing, they didn't see it as an offense and pondered seriously.</p><p>The Bihen Yuanjing is precious, but the three sects don't urgently need it, so there's no need to upset Qin Sang.</p><p>Moreover, the unique aspect of this world is that the Bihen Yuanjing, like the Kongchen Jade, is renewable.  By guarding the Sky Sea Cave Heaven, they can obtain more Bihen Yuanjing, although it takes a very long time, with each small amount taking a century to accumulate.</p><p>After a telepathic discussion, they quickly reached an agreement. Gu Yun Sou said, "Good! Since Daoist Master urgently needs the Bihen Yuanjing, we will grant your wish. You may take it all."</p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, sat cross-legged, and sent his divine sense into the space to carefully sense the Bihen Yuanjing.</p><p>Subtle ripples disturbed the space.</p><p>After an examination, Qin Sang had a plan, informed the others, who had no objections, and began to harvest it.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, taking out pieces of spiritual wood to create wooden boxes on the spot.</p><p>The Bihen Yuanjing must be stored in spiritual wood to preserve its power, and it cannot come into contact with other elements.</p><p>With a gesture, strands of Bihen Yuanjing flew towards him, filling a box.</p><p>As he continued collecting, the blue light in the space gradually dimmed, the Bihen Yuanjing becoming scarcer until only a layer remained.</p><p>Having gathered so much Bihen Yuanjing, Qin Sang was satisfied. This alone made the journey worthwhile.</p><p>The four returned to the surface. The jade vein fissure sealed itself, ready for the next harvest.</p><p>Leaving the Heavenly Sea Eye, the four went to the small restricted area, following the Western Sea to the South Sea, reaching the last large restricted area.</p><p>This one was located under the sea.</p><p>According to Hong Mei, this place was once a prison used to confine the world's most vicious demons. None who entered escaped, and resentment filled the air. For some reason, it had become even more dangerous and terrifying, and living creatures should avoid it.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others felt a chill even from above. After descending into the ocean, they saw a landmass rise, like a black dragon lying on the seabed, completely dark.</p><p>Passing through a layer of icy black water, a black mountain range appeared before them, its rocks and soil jet black, like the ashes of decaying demonic corpses, eerie and sinister.</p><p>Surprisingly, the black water, capable of corroding anything, was internally calm and harmless.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Master Yu's eyes flashed. He spread his five fingers, and several streams of light flew out, revealing themselves to be multicolored beetles.</p><p>These beetles scattered in all directions, burrowing underground.  Moments later, they returned, the patterns on their backs slightly altered.</p><p>Master Yu stared at the patterns, exclaiming, "This place is a superb medicinal field, a Yin extreme of this world, particularly suitable for yin-loving herbs. Cultivation here will surely be twice the result for half the effort."</p><p>"Oh?  So, this place is no less valuable than the Celestial Sea Eye. Our sect has been sorely lacking superior medicinal fields," Elder Gu said joyfully.</p><p>Qin Sang was naturally pleased as well. The greater the value of the Azure Sky Cave Heaven, the deeper the foundation of the Green Sheep Sect.</p><p>"These two forbidden lands seem to be the greatest value of this world.  Sadly, the other two forbidden lands were emptied by the Jitian Sect, I wonder what treasures they obtained," Master Ying mused, "I had originally planned to establish a joint villa for the four sects, but now we need to carefully plan and manage this world. What are the thoughts of my three fellow Daoists?"</p><p>With the basic exploration of the Azure Sky Cave Heaven complete, the remaining details were left to the younger generation. The four began to discuss important matters.</p><p>First, they decided on the distribution method.  For example, the Azure Trace Essence and the Sky Summit Jade would be divided into seven parts, with the Green Sheep Sect, Cloud City Heaven, and Ancient Wheat Garden each receiving two parts, and the Shangling Academy receiving one.</p><p>Qin Sang also conceded on other matters.</p><p>The key was how to manage it in the future to achieve perfection.</p><p>"The medicinal field must not be revealed.  Not only should we station guards, but we must also set up sealing formations.  Furthermore, while we cannot reverse the trend, we must strive to slow down or even stop the Cave Heaven's continued fragmentation. Ideally, we should use formations, and this requires the concerted efforts of our four sects!"</p><p>Elder Gu said solemnly.</p><p>"My Heavenly River Slaughter Formation's materials are almost ready and can be deployed outside the Dao marker as a protective boundary array!"</p><p>Qin Sang stated. During the last month of the Jitian Assembly, he had been extremely busy, contacting various forces and collecting materials, even going so far as to sell spiritual treasures at low prices.</p><p>In any case, the array would serve a dual purpose.</p><p>This way, he could exert less effort within the world, preventing the depletion of the Green Sheep Sect.</p><p>Seeing the hesitation of the three, Qin Sang understood their concerns and explained, "There is no need to worry.  This formation is inherently ever-changing. Even those proficient in it cannot easily break it.  The Heavenly River Slaughter Formation I will deploy will also incorporate my understanding of the Stellar Dao, making the formation even more difficult to decipher. Even Zhen Laomo himself would not gain an advantage.  Once the formation is set up, the three of you will see for yourselves.”</p><p>"Very well," Elder Gu nodded. "With Daoist's Heavenly River Slaughter Formation, we can concentrate on managing the world within."</p><p>"Initially, we could send more disciples here to act as a living formation."</p><p>"It might be better to improve the climate in certain areas, bring in mortals, and let them reproduce and thrive. This might have a miraculous effect through humanity nourishing the Dao."</p><p>"Is there any basis for this?  The true mountain gate of the Jitian Sect is said to be a small Cave Heaven. Has Daoist Yu been inside, or did you hear it from some elder?"</p><p>"Neither. It was a sudden thought of mine."</p><p>…</p><p>The four finalized their plans within this great forbidden land, agreeing to work together to manage this small thousand world.</p><p>Countless tasks lay ahead, requiring immediate attention. The four left the Azure Sky Cave Heaven, taking the five great wood spirits with them.</p><p>They passed through the Dao marker gate and entered the Great Thousand World.</p><p>"Is this the Immortal Realm?"</p><p>Vast blue waves stretched out before them.</p><p>Hong Mei looked at the azure sky and calm sea, a stark contrast to the Azure Sky Cave Heaven. Feeling the abundant spiritual energy, her heart was filled with emotion.</p><p>"The Immortal Realm?" Master Ying chuckled. "We are also on the path to seeking the Immortal Dao."</p><p>Qin Sang softly said, "The Great Thousand World is not the Immortal Realm, but it may contain paths leading to it.”</p><p>Hong Mei and the flower spirit stood side-by-side, like twin sisters, seeming to understand, and bowed together. "Thank you, Sect Master, for your guidance."</p><p>"Write down your cultivation methods. Also, be careful during your next tribulation, but remember that danger also presents opportunity,"</p><p>Qin Sang said; this was the true guidance.</p><p>After setting a time to meet again, the four separated. Qin Sang and Elder Gu flew towards Wanluo Island.</p><p>Zhen Laomo’s injuries had not healed, making it inconvenient for him to go out and meet them. Qin Sang and Elder Gu exchanged a few words with him remotely before taking their leave.</p><p>The Cloud-Crossing Treasure Ship soared into the air, leaving Wanluo Island and turning into a green streak of light, returning to Cloud City Heaven at maximum speed.</p><p>Qin Sang declined the invitation to stay and immediately rushed to the Green Sheep Sect.</p><p>The Green Sheep Sect was severely lacking in experts.  Managing both the Azure Sky Cave Heaven and the sect required careful planning.</p><p>Qin Sang left these matters to the two Great Demon Marquis and Taiyi, made his arrangements, and then returned to his secluded residence to begin refining the Heavenly River Slaughter Formation!</p>
