<h1>Chapter 923: Ambush</h1><p>Late afternoon.</p><p>Two figures stealthily left Hai Chan Island.  After flying some distance, they used their magical flight to head towards the deeper parts of the Demon Sea.</p><p>One of them had a long beard and looked to be close to fifty years old, yet he was extremely respectful to the younger man.</p><p>The young man was the Fang family youth, the senior disciple of Black Snake Mountain, whom Qin Sang had previously encountered.</p><p>“Senior Brother, I’ve searched this sea area for months and confirmed that the nest belongs to a rare Obscure Light Beast.  There’s a high chance it’s a late-stage or even peak-stage妖丹 beast. My cultivation is too low, I’m afraid of being discovered by the Obscure Light Beast, so I didn't dare get too close. I could only ask Senior Brother to investigate the truth about this beast's lair…”</p><p>The older cultivator led the way, transmitting his voice.</p><p>The Fang family youth grunted, saying indifferently, “If there’s only this Obscure Light Beast in the lair, the two of us will directly kill it.  If other powerful demonic beasts are present, we'll have to wait a few more days and invite some helpers before we act. The Obscure Light Beast's dual pupils are the most crucial ingredient in Master's needed medicine recipe, the sooner we get them, the better.”</p><p>Just as he was speaking, the Fang family youth suddenly frowned, “Are you sure no other forces are eyeing this beast?”</p><p>The older cultivator was startled, and confidently said, “Senior Brother, rest assured. I acted very cautiously, never revealing the Obscure Light Beast’s location to anyone, and I’ve been secretly observing the lair for a long time, and haven’t discovered any signs of other forces.”</p><p>The Fang family youth nodded slightly and said nothing more.</p><p>But in his heart, he couldn't help but recall a shameful incident from years ago, his teeth grinding silently.</p><p>To this day, he still couldn't figure out where he went wrong.  He had repeatedly reviewed the entire plan, carefully considering every detail; his junior brothers had no possibility of betrayal, yet in the end, the plan failed, allowing his enemy to reap the benefits.</p><p>Even more tragically, they were double-crossed. So many senior brothers went out, and only three returned to the sect alive.</p><p>The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.</p><p>How did that oriole discover their secret and silently follow them?</p><p>Although their Master didn't severely punish him upon his return to Black Snake Mountain, the Fang family youth always remembered this incident as a lifelong disgrace. For years he hadn't given up searching for that person, longing to tear them to pieces to ease his hatred.</p><p>That person, however, vanished from the face of the earth.</p><p>The Cang Lang Sea and the Demon Sea are both exceptionally vast; hiding one person is easy, and as they weren't human, it was difficult to get accurate information.</p><p>But in the Fang family youth's view, these were not excuses. He would absolutely not give up on revenge.  A fierce look flashed in the Fang family youth's eyes. That person had better pray they never fell into his hands.</p><p>The two exchanged a few more words and silently flew towards the beast's lair.</p><p>Three days later, they arrived above an unremarkable deserted island.</p><p>The older cultivator stopped his magical flight and pointed at the island.</p><p>“Senior Brother, the lair is not far ahead. I’ve opened a cave dwelling here. Why don’t we rest for a while, adjust our state, and then go investigate the lair…?”</p><p>The Fang family youth nodded, and his magical flight shifted, about to land on the island, when his eyes suddenly shot out sharp light, “Who’s sneaking around!”</p><p>Almost at the same time as the Fang family youth's furious shout, a swift sword light suddenly flashed from the forest below, accompanied by an extremely sharp sword cry, heading straight for them.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Fang family youth reacted extremely quickly, slapping his waist pouch. The blood sword that had accompanied him for many years turned into a bloody rainbow, intercepting the sword light.</p><p>The two flying swords touched and separated, seemingly evenly matched.</p><p>Then, ripples of a restriction appeared in the forest, and three figures emerged.</p><p>“Senior Brother, it wasn’t me…”</p><p>Suddenly caught in a catastrophe, the older cultivator hadn’t understood what was happening. Discovering that his senior brother was glaring fiercely at him, he was terrified and quickly defended himself.</p><p>“Friend Fang, don’t you recognize me?”</p><p>One of them removed their mask, revealing Qin Sang.</p><p>The other two, naturally, were his external avatars.</p><p>He looked at the Fang family youth with a playful expression, and said with some emotion, “I’ve searched the Demon Sea for three whole years, finally waiting for you to appear.”</p><p>Since he had the strength to take revenge, he had no intention of continuing to swallow his anger.</p><p>Qin Sang understood that once he made his move, it would inevitably alert the Black Snake Mountain ancestor, and the other party could easily use this as a trap to lure him into a net.</p><p>There was only one chance. His target was the Fang family youth.</p><p>Furthermore, to enhance his external manifestation, he needed a powerful cultivator like the young man surnamed Fang as a sacrifice to reach the peak.</p><p>Qin Sang, concealing his identity, cultivated while searching for clues.  It took three years to confirm the whereabouts of the Black Serpent Mountain disciples, patiently lying in wait until he finally intercepted his target.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang was even stronger than before, a peak Golden Core cultivator, only a hair's breadth from Core Formation.</p><p>But as long as he wasn't a Nascent Soul cultivator, Qin Sang was absolutely confident that this person couldn't escape his grasp.</p><p>"It's you! You dare show your face before me!"</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang instantly recognized Qin Sang, the man he hated with a burning passion. His eyes filled with blood, he laughed furiously, "Good! Good! This is too easy! Hand over the stone platform, and I'll let you die quickly!"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, "Fang Daoist, you haven't forgotten the stone platform. Perhaps you should worry about your own life first! Kill!"</p><p>Before his voice faded, Qin Sang, his manifestation, and the two-headed… beast attacked.</p><p>Three figures suddenly separated.</p><p>Qin Sang charged directly at the young man surnamed Fang, while his manifestation and the two-headed… beast engaged the Wu tribe cultivators, preparing to eliminate them first.</p><p>Seeing this, the young man surnamed Fang was somewhat surprised. He had assessed the opponent's cultivation and understood that the ambush was deliberate.</p><p>He had expected the attacker to be the unfamiliar Golden Core late-stage cultivator, not Qin Sang.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang was close.</p><p>A green light surged from Qin Sang, and a pair of exceptionally beautiful phoenix wings unfurled behind him, startling the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang's aura skyrocketed, reaching a level that made the young man surnamed Fang's face change drastically.</p><p>"What kind of secret technique is this?"</p><p>A premonition of danger struck the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>Qin Sang, who only possessed mid-Golden Core cultivation, now, after using this transformation ability, had an aura that was almost as strong as his.  At this moment, the young man surnamed Fang truly felt the danger and his expression changed drastically.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>With the phoenix wings, Qin Sang's speed soared, and in a flash, he appeared before the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>Demonic energy enveloped Qin Sang, his wings spread wide, like a bloodthirsty, ferocious demon, pouncing forward.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang was incredibly shocked, but his movements were not slow. A dark light flashed from him, revealing strange insect armor. Then, with a flick of his arm, his blood-red sword unleashed a crimson sword energy, striking swiftly.</p>
