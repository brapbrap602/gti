<h1>Chapter 1132: Peak of the Golden Core Realm</h1><p>---</p><p>"The mysterious stone slab was discovered in the ancient battlefield of the Immortals. Reflecting on it now, that place was likely a secret realm of the demon race. In my opinion, the only thing of value there was this stone slab. Although I was the first to discover it, the Demon King Qianji and a demonic Nascent Soul cultivator also entered the realm at the same time. Seeing that it was an ancient treasure of the demon race, I didn’t want to take unnecessary risks, so I chose not to reveal myself and quietly retreated..."</p><p>As Qingjun recalled the events of that time, her expression shifted slightly, as if she had just remembered something important.</p><p>"Back then, when they were fighting over the stone slab, the battle was extremely fierce, and it took a long time before a victor emerged. By that time, the ancient formation sealing the stone slab had already been broken. In the end, Demon King Qianji gained the upper hand and managed to seize the stone slab before flying away. It’s likely that because of the shadow of the Azure Phoenix, the stone slab couldn’t be stored in a spatial pouch or any similar treasure..."</p><p>"It can’t be stored in a spatial pouch?" Qin Sang’s expression turned to one of surprise.</p><p>Such treasures were indeed rare, each with its own unique reason—either they had an extraordinary origin or possessed astonishing power.</p><p>However, this was good news for Qin Sang.</p><p>Demon King Qianji couldn’t possibly carry the stone slab with him at all times. If it was stored in his cave abode, Qin Sang might still have a chance.</p><p>"Based on the intelligence we’ve gathered from the spies of the Two Domains Alliance, the Sin Abyss was previously delayed by a certain matter, which wasn’t a true reflection of their strength. This allowed us to seize some advantages. It’s almost certain that once the Sin Abyss resolves their issues, they will strike again. This time, the momentum of the Sin Abyss is different from before, and it’s likely to be a brutal and bloody battle. To avoid being caught off guard, I must head to the frontlines immediately..."</p><p>As Qingjun spoke of the results of the alliance meeting, she revealed that she would be leaving the Minor Cold Domain.</p><p>She glanced at Qin Sang and said, "For now, you don’t need to worry. Dongyang Bo will also be going. In the fight against the Sin Abyss, there’s no room for error, so it’s unlikely he’ll have the energy to trouble you. Over the next few years, you can cultivate within the Illusory Mist Sect. The sect’s protective formation will ensure your safety. However..."</p><p>Qingjun’s tone suddenly shifted as she warned, "Right now, we’re only seeing signs of the impending war. Before the war begins, I can buy you some time. But once the survival of the cultivation world is at stake, I can’t let you hide in the sect forever... unless you leave the Minor Cold Domain."</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression darkened as he understood Qingjun’s meaning. The time he had left to make a breakthrough was running out.</p><p>If he failed to break through, Qin Sang knew that no matter how strong he was, his value couldn’t compare to that of a Nascent Soul cultivator. He wouldn’t have the face to ask Qingjun to continue protecting him.</p><p>Once he entered the battlefield, even with numerous life-preserving methods, he would have to constantly guard against Dongyang Bo’s open and hidden attacks.</p><p>The Purple Palace hadn’t opened yet, so he couldn’t return to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>To the south, beyond the Heavenly Alliance, lay the territory controlled by the Sin Abyss. In the current situation, heading there would be akin to walking into a trap.</p><p>---</p><p>The mountain gate of Shaohua Mountain was located within a vast marshland, while the Illusory Mist Sect was situated in the mountain range along the shore.</p><p>In the Minor Cold Domain, this mountain range was second only to the Heaven-Sundering Mountains in size. It stretched westward from the northern shore of the Yun Cang Marsh before changing direction and extending all the way to the far north, forming a natural barrier that separated the human and demon territories.</p><p>The mountain gate of the Spirit Taming Sect was also located within this mountain range, though further to the north.</p><p>Traveling directly west from the Illusory Mist Sect would lead one straight into the demon territory.</p><p>Deep within the ancient forests, two figures flew through the air.</p><p>Here, two towering peaks stood, their terrain perilous, with only a hundred zhang of space between them, resembling a gate. This was the mountain gate of the Illusory Mist Sect.</p><p>Qingjun led Qin Sang through the gate and into the sect’s interior.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that everything within the Illusory Mist Sect appeared normal.</p><p>Low-level cultivators bustled about, busy with various tasks, and the entire sect operated as usual.</p><p>After Qingjun took control of the Illusory Mist Sect, she had been warned by figures like the Red-Haired Ancestor not to act recklessly within the sect. She disguised herself as Leng Yuntian, secretly eliminating a few individuals involved in the assassination plot before stopping, ensuring that not too many were implicated.</p><p>As a result, the other disciples of the Illusory Mist Sect remained completely unaware of the changes within their sect.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t help but admire Qingjun’s incredible skill in disguise, wondering if it was due to her expertise in the art of puppetry.</p><p>"This was originally the cave abode of the Leng father and son. You can cultivate here," Qingjun said, bringing Qin Sang to a restricted area within the Illusory Mist Sect.</p><p>As they spoke, an elder from the Illusory Mist Sect came to request an audience.</p><p>"Elder Xun, gather all the disciples in the sect who are at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage or above, including the elders, and assemble them in the main hall. I will join you shortly," Qingjun ordered.</p><p>"As you command!" Elder Xun acknowledged and left.</p><p>Seeing that Qingjun was about to summon the sect’s disciples, Qin Sang truly felt the urgency of the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly spoke up, "Senior Sister, I’ve been thinking. I won’t cultivate within the Illusory Mist Sect. If Dongyang Bo truly intends to kill me, and if I’m forced to leave for some reason, I might fall into a trap."</p><p>Qin Sang had no objections. "Very well."</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly escorted away by Qingjun and returned to the cave abode of the wandering cultivator, bringing Bai along with him.</p><p>This was the advantage of having multiple hideouts.</p><p>Bai had been fully focused on comprehending the Soul Pearl and didn’t mind where they were.</p><p>"The Star Essence Baptism was effective. My physical body has indeed grown stronger, but it doesn’t count as a true breakthrough. It’s far from reaching the fourth level. Being stuck in this limbo, I wonder how much help it will actually be?"</p><p>Qin Sang entered seclusion, examining his body through internal vision. After a long period of contemplation, he flipped his palm and took out a jade slip.</p><p>Before leaving, Qingjun had given him the Illusory Mist Sect’s treasured insights on breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, left behind by their ancestors.</p><p>Qin Sang was deeply grateful for this.</p><p>But he also understood that this might be the last time Qingjun would help him.</p><p>After briefly reviewing the contents of the jade slip, Qin Sang activated his cultivation technique and entered a meditative state.</p><p>---</p><p>The shadow of war once again loomed over the Minor Cold Domain.</p><p>At this stage, both sides were still in a standoff, probing each other’s strengths.</p><p>However, the relaxed atmosphere of the past was long gone.</p><p>As battle reports continued to come in, although it became clear that the Sin Abyss wasn’t as overwhelmingly powerful as initially feared, a layer of gloom still settled over the faces of the cultivators.</p><p>For low-level cultivators, they could only resign themselves to fate.</p><p>Four years passed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained completely focused and finally completed the engraving of the seventh killing talisman, breaking through to the peak of the Golden Core realm!</p><p>Both his realm and cultivation had reached their zenith.</p><p>However, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s breakthrough to the late third transformation had occurred many years after Qin Sang’s, so it couldn’t progress so quickly. Knowing that haste was futile, Qin Sang had prepared ample spiritual medicines. It would only be a matter of a few years before the Heavenly Eye Butterfly reached the peak of the third transformation.</p><p>After reaching the peak of his realm, Qin Sang didn’t end his seclusion. Instead, he continued to refine his cultivation, reflecting on his past experiences, and filling in any gaps.</p><p>At the same time, he studied the insights on breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage that Qingjun had left him.</p><p>At this stage, it was impossible to take the Tribulation Transcendence Pill.</p><p>However, Qin Sang still attempted to break through the bottleneck a few times on his own, with results that were unsurprising.</p><p>Thinking of how Dongyang Bo had poured so much effort into nurturing so many disciples, each with greater talent than himself, yet none had succeeded in forming a Nascent Soul, Qin Sang felt a sense of resignation.</p><p>"Contemplating these insights doesn’t necessarily require staying in seclusion here. Before the Heavenly Eye Butterfly reaches its peak, I might as well make a trip to the demon territory. In this situation, the demon territory will also be affected. Perhaps I’ll find something of value..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered thoughtfully.</p><p>This was also why he didn’t want to be confined to the Illusory Mist Sect.</p><p>He was still unwilling to give up.</p>
