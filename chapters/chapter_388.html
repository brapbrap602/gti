<h1>Chapter 381: Nascent Soul</h1><p>Qin Sang followed the instructions and walked briskly for a few steps, before the view suddenly opened up.</p><p>It turned out that this grassland was just a corner of a vast world. Only within the grassland was there such peace and tranquility.</p><p>Beyond the grassland, the sky was filled with a myriad of glowing clouds, obscuring the sky. The earth was fragmented, filled with perilous mountains, cliffs, and deep abysses. Even space itself felt turbulent and unstable.</p><p>This feeling wasn't an illusion. As far as the eye could see, within this space, there were a dozen or so places constantly ravaged by violent storms.</p><p>Standing within the crevice, shielded from the sound, one could still see the terrifying power of these storms.</p><p>Such powerful storms, yet they couldn't shake the glowing clouds, which remained firmly in place.</p><p>The glow and the chaotic clouds intertwined, condensed and unyielding.</p><p>Undoubtedly, these were incredibly dangerous ancient restrictions.</p><p>Among them were also strands of white, black, and silver. Some were so large, tens of yards long and several yards wide, floating in mid-air like clouds.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen similar black lines in ancient cultivators' ruins and recognized them at once. These were spatial rifts!</p><p>For Foundation Establishment cultivators like them, danger lurked everywhere, with almost no safe ground to stand on. It was hard to imagine how Cloudtraveler had found a safe route.</p><p>Seeing the inner valley's landscape, Qin Sang imagined having to traverse such a place to reach its depths.</p><p>Even with his courage, his face paled slightly.  He hesitated to take the next step out of the crevice, pulling his foot back as if burned.</p><p>"This grassland is a rare haven within the inner valley. Don't worry, Brother Qin…"</p><p>Cloudtraveler stepped out first, onto the grassland. He surveyed the surroundings, his gaze sweeping over the various anomalies, before finally settling on a spot between two storms. He pointed, his voice tinged with excitement.</p><p>"It's there. We've been inside for a while, and there's still a long way to go. Thanks to that senior paving the way, we haven't been too exhausted.  To avoid further complications, let's start now. Brother Qin, you must follow me closely. Don't deviate from the path, or you could easily trigger a restriction or a spatial rift."</p><p>Without waiting for a reply, Cloudtraveler launched his flying light, heading straight for his target.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled and followed without hesitation. Since he had come this far, there was no turning back. He could only hope that the path Cloudtraveler knew hadn't changed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two flew across the grassland, arriving before the storms.</p><p>The two storms whipped up countless rocks and sand, transforming into two tornadoes rising from the earth, close but not merging.</p><p>Cloudtraveler seemed oblivious to the stones being torn apart by the storm. His figure flashed, and he flew directly into the gap between the two tornadoes. Qin Sang hesitated for a moment before following.</p><p>The expected destructive force wasn't there. Between the raging tornadoes, it was surprisingly calm.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly amazed. He looked around and saw Cloudtraveler’s flying light continuing, already emerging from the gap. He quickly followed suit.</p><p>Thus, the two flying lights, one after the other, navigated through countless deadly dangers.</p><p>Their speed varied, sometimes requiring them to make large detours to find a safe route.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, strictly adhering to Cloudtraveler’s warnings, following closely behind, never stepping off the path.</p><p>He gradually felt reassured.  Along the way, Cloudtraveler hardly paused, always appearing confident. Every time they encountered a seemingly impassable obstacle, he found a way around, a welcome relief.</p><p>Under these circumstances, Qin Sang didn't dare to relax, memorizing the route.</p><p>Once they reached their destination, if Qin Sang could hold back the strange man and send Cloudtraveler in, they would have to part ways. He couldn't stay in this place indefinitely, waiting for Cloudtraveler.</p><p>They had already agreed that after leaving the Boundless Valley, Qin Sang would return to Green Sun Market and wait. If Cloudtraveler didn't appear within a month, Qin Sang would give the token to Li Yufu.</p><p>After many twists and turns, they went deeper into the inner valley. Qin Sang skillfully followed Cloudtraveler's route, with enough attention to observe the surrounding environment.</p><p>He was most curious about the origin of the Boundless Valley.</p><p>Legend had it that the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was formed when ancient immortals battled and shattered space.  Was the Boundless Valley also a consequence of that battle?</p><p>He wondered what existed within those ancient restrictions, perhaps ancient treasures?</p><p>According to Cloudtraveler, most of the restrictions were empty.</p><p>Some Nascent Soul cultivators would spend a fortune and considerable time preparing methods to break the restrictions, only to find nothing. Such occurrences were common.</p><p>While Qin Sang was lost in thought, Cloudtraveler suddenly stopped and turned sharply, looking towards the left with a grave expression.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, thinking they had encountered danger.  Just as he was about to ask, Cloudtraveler made a silencing gesture, looked around, flew to a steep hillside, and hid behind a yellowish-brown rock, peering towards the horizon.</p><p>Qin Sang followed and looked in the same direction. In the distance, mountains stood tall. At the edge of their vision, two mountains stood close together, forming a gap facing their direction.</p><p>Spiritual energy within the gap converged into a surging wave, forming a river of spiritual energy. It suddenly plunged downwards like a celestial river, crashing into the depths of the gap.</p><p>Lying on the hillside, they couldn't see what the 'celestial river' was impacting, but guessed it might be an ancient restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. Such a surge of spiritual energy didn't seem natural.</p><p>Could it be…?</p><p>Just as the thought crossed his mind, he saw two figures in black robes appear after the spiritual energy dissipated.</p><p>The two hovered in mid-air, their black robes concealing their faces. They looked down, seemingly discussing something.</p><p>Cloudtraveler turned, his expression grave, and mouthed a single word.</p><p>"Nascent Soul!"</p><p>He then gestured to Qin Sang, signaling him not to look directly.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that Nascent Soul cultivators had keen spiritual senses and could detect his gaze. He quickly averted his eyes, using his peripheral vision to observe, secretly relieved that they were far away, and ancient restrictions blocked their aura. Otherwise, they would have been discovered.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang had seen Nascent Soul cultivators, and two at once!</p><p>He had often imagined what it would be like to witness a Nascent Soul cultivator in action.</p><p>Would the heavens crumble and the earth shatter? Or would rivers flow in reverse?</p><p>Now it seemed that the celestial river of spiritual energy hadn't caused any significant destruction. Perhaps they were holding back.</p><p>Qin Sang made a 'sword' gesture towards Cloudtraveler.</p><p>He was asking if the Wuji Sect expert who killed the Starvenom Toad was one of them.</p><p>Cloudtraveler slowly shook his head, indicating he didn't know.</p>
