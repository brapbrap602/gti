Chapter 219: Jiang Ying

With a twist in the void, an old man in black robes gradually solidified from the illusion.
Before the man could fully manifest, a ripple suddenly surged out of the malignant miasma, and a blood-red sword gleam shot out with a swish. The sword qi effortlessly cut through the toxic miasma, casting a dazzling brilliance.
Even miasma that could poison cultivators and corrode magic artifacts could not damage this spirit sword in the slightest.
The sword qi was as red as blood, and its terrifying killing intent struck directly at the heart, seizing souls and capturing spirits!
The brawny man and scholar were utterly terrified, with only one thought in their minds: Escape!
“Retreat quickly!”
The black-robed old man who had just arrived had a sudden change in expression and shouted out loud.
The brawny man and scholar had already heard their Big Brother’s warning, and their instincts were also urging them to flee quickly. They had judged the situation wrongly. This man was not a fat sheep, but a man-eating tiger!
Unfortunately, the gap between them and Qin Sang was too vast. Their defenses were destroyed as easily as dried weeds by the killing intent emanating from the Ebonywood Sword, and they could not resist at all.
Inside their minds, they were incomparably anxious, but their bodies did not obey their commands. They felt a chill in their chests, and then the spirit sword pierced their hearts.
Bang! Bang!
Two bodies crashed to the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.
All this happened too quickly. The black-robed old man who had walked out of the void had just arrived and saw his two brothers killed with ease. He could not rescue them in time at all.
The malicious miasma lost its master, and after a period of intense fluctuation, it almost dissipated. Then, out of the center of the miasma, a suction force suddenly appeared, and a figure wearing an evil ghost mask emerged, absorbing all the miasma into his palm.
This person was none other than Qin Sang. He no longer concealed his true cultivation level, Foundation Establishment!
Swish!
As Qin Sang appeared, several black lights suddenly flew out from his side and landed around the black-robed old man in the blink of an eye. Under the cover of the miasma, he had already set up the Ten Directions Yama Array.
The ghost banner fluttered, and demonic energy surged.
Seeing the momentum of the great array, the black-robed old man’s pupils suddenly contracted. He said solemnly, “My two subordinates were blind and have offended my fellow Daoist, and they deserved to die. Fortunately, my fellow Daoist was not injured. This old man will apologize to my fellow Daoist. How about we shake hands and reconcile? This old man swears to never step foot in Changyang Market again. From now on, we will not interfere with each other, how about that?”
Qin Sang indifferently said, “Why does my fellow Daoist speak such naive words? If you surrender, relax your mind, and let me plant a restriction on your body, I might consider letting you live.”
Since he had already set up the Ten Directions Yama Array, Qin Sang had no intention of letting him escape.
The black-robed old man was furious. “Arrogant rat! Do you really think you have me in your grasp?”
If a restriction was planted in his mind, his life and death would be controlled by the other party, allowing them to do whatever they wanted with him. How could the black-robed old man agree? He immediately roared, and a stunning blade gleam suddenly cleaved through the demonic energy.
Then, the deafening sound of thunder rang out, and the blade gleam instantly released countless extremely yang and extremely powerful bolts of lightning that danced like silver snakes.
…
“Truly, capturing an opponent at the Foundation Establishment stage alive is not easy.”
Qin Sang sighed. He had planned to use the Soulstrangling Thread to slowly wear down the black-robed old man’s primordial spirit and then seize an opportunity to capture him alive. However, the other party quickly noticed Qin Sang’s intentions. In the end, he would rather die than surrender and unleashed a secret technique that left both sides injured.
Sensing the power of the secret technique, Qin Sang did not dare to be careless. He immediately attacked with full force, using the Ebonywood Sword to kill the black-robed old man. Fortunately, the body was still mostly intact, so it could still be refined into a Corpsefiend.
Spiritual energy swept up the three bodies and then collected their mustard seed pouches. Qin Sang cautiously scanned his surroundings, activated his sword gleam, and flew away, breaking through the void.
Corpsefiends can be refined from Foundation Establishment bodies, while Corpsecops can be refined from Qi Condensation bodies. They are both very useful corpse puppets. For Qin Sang, their greatest use now was to lure cloud beasts, avoiding the need for him to personally act and accidentally falling into an encirclement of cloud beasts.
The Corpsefiend refined by White Cloud Hermit had been destroyed more than a decade ago. At that time, Qin Sang had accidentally fallen into a group of cloud beasts and had been unable to escape in time, so he could only abandon the Corpsefiend and leave it behind to hold up the rear. As a result, the Corpsefiend was torn to shreds by the cloud beasts.
That’s when Qin Sang came up with the idea of fishing.
By using the Spirit Concealment Technique to hide his cultivation level, unless their cultivation level was much higher than his or they possessed some kind of secret technique, it was difficult to see through Qin Sang’s true cultivation level.

He kept his cultivation level secret, and every year and a half he would come out and sell a large batch of Fire Essence Stones in various marketplaces. He pretended to accidentally reveal his whereabouts, attracting those who were interested to take the bait.

Those people dared to take advantage of Qin Sang's business without capital, so he turned around and did the same to them. He was now very familiar with how to do so.

The thieves who did this kind of thing were all very careful, so Qin Sang could not succeed every time.

If the thieves he attracted were too powerful, he could only flee using his Cloud-Dropping Wings after turning invisible, or fight them head-on, forcing them to retreat. Because of this, his Cloud-Dropping Wings and Heavenly Star's Tear had been destroyed a few years ago.

Fortunately, he later became familiar with the habits of the Cloud Beasts, so he lost fewer Corpse Puppets, and had enough to sustain his consumption.

Unfortunately, Qin Sang still had not captured any Foundation Building stage cultivators, but he had captured a few Qi Condensation stage thieves. However, he could not use them to refine Corpse Puppets because Corpse Puppets required Foundation Building stage cultivators.

...

Sky Crystal Secret Realm.

"Martial Uncle Qin!"

The two guards guarding the secret realm opened the secret realm and saw Qin Sang walking in. They immediately bowed politely and looked at him with eager eyes. Qin Sang smiled and nodded, taking out two bottles of spiritual wine he had bought from the Taiyi Pill Pavilion and tossing them to them.

"Azure Rainbow Wine! Thank you, Martial Uncle Qin!"

The two men's eyes lit up when they saw the spiritual wine. They could not wait to open the bottle and take a big gulp, their faces showing intoxication.

The tempting aroma of wine wafted through the air.

This Azure Rainbow Wine was one of the best spiritual wines of the Taiyi Pill Pavilion. It was brewed from several spiritual fruits and not only tasted excellent but also increased one's spiritual power by a sliver after drinking it.

The price of Azure Rainbow Wine was not cheap, and the secret realm guards were all at the Qi Condensation stage, so they were naturally reluctant to buy it. However, it was not a big deal for Qin Sang. Every time he went to the marketplace, he would bring back a batch and give it to them to foster goodwill.

Qin Sang had some small tasks that required manpower, and they were also willing to help.

"Take it easy. Only one bottle per person, no more."

Qin Sang threw another storage bag to them and said with a laugh, "This is for the others. If you two alcoholics dare to pocket it, be careful or I'll skin you alive!"

The two men opened the storage bag and counted the number of bottles. They found that there were two more bottles than the number of people, and they smiled even more happily. They flattered him, saying, "Martial Uncle Qin, rest assured. We will definitely handle it properly!"

Qin Sang pointed at them and smiled helplessly. He was about to fly back to his cave when he suddenly remembered something and turned around and asked, "Where is Jiang Ying now?"

The two men looked at each other, wondering why Qin Sang was suddenly asking about Jiang Ying. However, they were sensible and did not ask too many questions. "Reporting to Martial Uncle Qin, Martial Sister Jiang is in her cave. She said that she is going to go into closed-door cultivation for a while, probably because she has some insights on her cultivation. If Martial Uncle Qin has anything urgent, you can go directly to Martial Sister Jiang's cave to look for her."

"I'll wait until she comes out of seclusion."

Qin Sang nodded and flew towards his cave on his sword.
