<h1>Chapter 2016: Evil Wind and Ghostly Thunder</h1><p>Traveling through the Distorted Spacetime, having witnessed scene after scene of fantastical and magnificent sights, Gu Ya gradually became unfazed.</p><p>After passing through yet another small world fragment, Gu Ya noticed that Qin Sang had suddenly stopped, gazing ahead with a seemingly sentimental expression.</p><p>At the end of the void, a multicolored radiance manifested. In some places, the colors were distinct, while in others, they blended together. But within each ray of light was a different scene, each one beyond human comprehension, not appearing to be naturally formed.</p><p>Moreover, some of the radiance seemed dormant on the surface, appearing peaceful within, without any apparent danger. Yet, they faintly emitted an aura that made Gu Ya's heart palpitate. If she had come alone, she would have definitely avoided them.</p><p>Seeing these familiar scenes reminded Qin Sang of the Ju Mountain Healing Platform. The scene ahead was just like the Ju Mountain Healing Platform, a divine ability left behind after the battles of ancient mighty figures.  It seemed as though it could last forever, having evolved over countless years, forming a real illusion.</p><p>He still remembered that period, which was probably the fastest stage of his cultivation. Hiding within the Healing Platform, free from disturbance, he only needed to focus single-mindedly on his cultivation.</p><p>The Feng Ju Jade Gate should be far more expansive than the Ju Mountain, unlike the 'crowded' Ju Mountain Healing Platform.  Some gaps existed between the radiance, forming patches of dark void. Those divine ability illusions were mostly stable, and as long as one was careful, even Nascent Soul cultivators could pass through safely.</p><p>Furthermore, there were also fragmented small worlds here, dividing the illusions into regions with varying degrees of danger.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang was still on the outer edges of the Feng Ju Jade Gate.  The interior might hold further changes.</p><p>With a single glance, he saw that there was almost nothing of value here, presumably having been ransacked countless times.</p><p>‘Thump! Thump! Thump!’</p><p>A heartbeat-like sound emanated from Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>After entering the Feng Ju Jade Gate, the inherited blood seal showed a clear reaction.  At this moment, blood light flickered in Qin Sang's palm as the inherited blood seal pulsed strongly, providing him with clear guidance.</p><p>Within the Feng Ju Jade Gate, it was easy to become disoriented, and many cultivators had become lost here.  Qin Sang turned his head, looking towards what should be the northwest. Judging by the reaction of the inherited blood seal, his destination was likely not far.</p><p>Increasing his speed once more, Qin Sang traveled like lightning between the divine ability illusions, sometimes barely brushing past them, even stirring up slight ripples. This was a far cry from his cautious approach within the Ju Mountain Healing Platform, making Gu Ya tremble with fear.</p><p>Here, day and night were indistinguishable.  After traveling an unknown distance, Gu Ya suddenly remembered something and asked in a low voice, "Senior, be careful. I've heard that there are natural disasters in the Feng Ju Jade Gate, called Evil Wind and Ghostly Thunder."</p><p>Qin Sang responded with a 'hmm'.  "This location isn't too deep.  The Evil Wind and Ghostly Thunder rarely reach this area."</p><p>The Evil Wind and Ghostly Thunder were similar to the fog waterfalls in the Sea of Mist, unique calamities of the Feng Ju Jade Gate.  Being labeled with the names 'evil' and 'ghostly', one could imagine how dangerous they were.</p><p>There were various theories regarding the origin of the Evil Wind and Ghostly Thunder.</p><p>One theory suggested that within the ancient battlefield, the divine abilities of the mighty figures had yet to subside, forming residual waves from the conflict.  Another theory posited that the destruction of too many small worlds had affected the greater world, destabilizing space. There was also the theory that the Feng Ju Jade Gate was an ancient sacred mountain of the Wu Clan, and remnants of the Wu Clan's grand formation might still exist.</p><p>None of these theories could be confirmed. What was certain was that each appearance of the Evil Wind and Ghostly Thunder often claimed countless lives, burying countless individuals who sought instant ascension.</p><p>The Evil Wind and Ghostly Thunder originated from the depths of the Feng Ju Jade Gate, their power gradually diminishing outward. But each appearance of the calamity would shake the already stable divine ability illusions and small world fragments, bringing unforeseen dangers.</p><p>Although there were signs of the calamity, the time left for reaction was very short, making it impossible to guard against.  Everyone could only try their best to avoid danger. The best countermeasure was to assess one's own strength, resist temptation, and avoid places one shouldn't go.</p><p>As they spoke, Qin Sang slowed down and, with a sweep of his gaze, suddenly entered a divine ability illusion.</p><p>The illusion was filled with dazzling white light, containing nothing else. The moment he entered, Qin Sang keenly perceived that this white light would invisibly affect one's spiritual sense and judgment.</p><p>After flying for a while within the white light, Qin Sang reached the other end of the divine ability illusion and discovered two more divine ability illusions ahead. The three illusions were close together, with only a narrow gap between them.</p><p>At this moment, the fluctuation of the inherited blood seal intensified dramatically, as if it would slip from his hand at any moment.  The target was the void within the gap.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with surprise.  Such a narrow space actually concealed the entrance to a small world.</p><p>Activating the inherited blood seal, the blood light swept away the darkness, revealing a tiny point of light.  Qin Sang's figure flickered, passing through the point of light and instantly entering another space.</p><p>This small world was probably the smallest Qin Sang had ever seen, as if it was still underdeveloped, with a radius of less than a thousand miles and undulating mountain ranges everywhere.</p><p>The space here was more stable than the small world fragments outside. Qin Sang wasn't sure if this was also a fragment or a newly born small world.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew Gu Ya's protective qi shield. Gu Ya couldn't help but sniff the air, catching a faint fragrance.</p><p>Following the fragrance, the gurgling sound of water came from ahead.  The two of them soon saw a clear pool in the center of a large valley, with a continuous flow of spring water bubbling up from within. The fragrance emanated from the spring water.</p><p>A stone tablet stood before the valley, inscribed with the words "Chen Clan Secret Realm".</p><p>Around the clear pool, restriction formations shimmered everywhere, with one or several spiritual herbs within each formation.</p><p>Gu Ya couldn't help but be stunned.  Among these spiritual herbs, those she could recognize were all extremely valuable, and there were some she didn't recognize, which at a glance, she knew were extraordinary.</p><p>"What kind of spring water is this? It seems to be able to nourish spiritual herbs…"</p><p>Qin Sang also saw that the area around the clear pool was a superior medicinal field, no worse than the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven.  There were a few spiritual herbs that would even tempt Void Refinement cultivators, and they were already mature.</p><p>"Deer Blood Epiphyllum, Green Pearl Bamboo…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked them over one by one, sighing inwardly with regret.  He had some understanding of alchemy, but he had neglected it later on.  He was willing but unable to refine spirit pills, and he lacked the corresponding pill recipes.</p><p>However, trading them would certainly fetch a good amount of spiritual materials, which was an unexpected gain.</p><p>That old devil Chen only treated this place as a medicinal field and didn't leave behind any other treasures.  Qin Sang's figure flashed repeatedly, collecting those top-grade spiritual herbs, leaving the rest for Gu Ya.  He then said to Gu Ya, "There's no danger here.  You stay here and heal your injuries first. I'll take you away after I've finished dealing with matters here. We'll go to Kan Province first."</p><p>Kan Province, one of the eight great celestial provinces, located in the east.</p><p>Kan represented the water trigram. The provincial capital of Kan Province wasn't on land but in the Eastern Sea.  It was said to be an ancient giant turtle, incredibly massive, its enormous shell carrying a celestial city.</p><p>Legend had it that the ancient giant turtle was still alive, currently in slumber.  If it were true, with such a long lifespan, it could be considered immortal to a certain extent.</p><p>"How long will Senior be gone?" Having finally encountered a senior from the lower realms, Gu Ya was afraid of being left behind.</p><p>"It won't be too long. I still have some things to do.  When your injuries are healed, come out and help me. I'll impart to you a refinement method for refining the Jade Heart Blade, so you can strive to ascend it to a spirit treasure as soon as possible.  You can kill a few more Chang You clansmen when we return."</p><p>Qin Sang took out a blank jade slip, inscribed the secret method, and handed it to Gu Ya.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior Qin, for bestowing this method. I will definitely study it diligently!" Gu Ya happily accepted it and eagerly began to browse its contents.</p><p>After settling Gu Ya, Qin Sang stayed for a while longer, meticulously setting up restrictions on the two captives, then left the Chen Clan Secret Realm, heading towards the agreed-upon location.</p><p>The agreed-upon location was even deeper within the Feng Ju Jade Gate, a void region with a radius of a hundred miles.</p><p>Illusions surrounded the void.  Qin Sang passed through the illusions, and upon entering the void, he saw the Luan Carriage parked in the center, with Young Master Xin and the others already there.</p><p>The dragon and phoenix pulling the carriage were gone, and the Luan Carriage had transformed into an elegant palace, quietly floating there.</p><p>Several stone platforms surrounded the Luan Carriage, with cultivators sitting cross-legged on each. Qu Zhen and the others occupied one of them.</p><p>The other stone platforms held unfamiliar faces, presumably the Xin Clan elites that Young Master Xin had mentioned.  All of them were at least at the Nascent Soul realm, and each team was led by a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>The moment he entered the void, Qin Sang's gaze fixed on the palace.  He saw that on one side of the palace was Young Master Xin's private chamber, still veiled with light gauze curtains, concealing his true appearance. The other side was empty, with only two people.</p><p>An unfamiliar young man sat cross-legged behind a jade table, his eyes closed, while Steward Luo carefully attended to him.</p><p>The young man had a long and thin face with particularly thick eyebrows. He wore a silver robe that shimmered with a metallic luster, woven from countless tiny scales, as soft as brocade.</p><p>This person was unexpectedly a Void Refinement cultivator, his aura even more profound than Qin Sang's, similar to Gu Yun Sou's, not far from the mid-Void Refinement stage.</p><p>At the same time, the young man's eyes suddenly opened, his gaze carrying a compelling force as it landed on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>"Greetings, Elder Qin."</p><p>Qu Zhen and the others also saw Qin Sang and immediately rose to greet him.  The Xin Clan cultivators also stood up, secretly sizing Qin Sang up.</p><p>"Elder Qin has finally arrived," Young Master Xin's voice came from behind the gauze curtain. "Allow me to introduce you. This is Senior Pei, a retainer of our Xin Clan, who has helped us through numerous tribulations. Senior Pei, this is Elder Qin of the Five Elements Alliance, whom I have specifically invited to assist us."</p><p>Senior Pei's brows furrowed slightly as he questioned coldly, "Inviting a Void Refinement cultivator for assistance, why didn't you discuss it with me first?"</p><p>His tone was like that of questioning a junior.</p><p>Young Master Xin's tone remained unchanged as he patiently explained, "This journey requires a Grandmaster Refiner.  Someone who has achieved such skill at the Nascent Soul stage is extremely rare.  I have tried to find one over these years, but there were no suitable candidates. Before Senior arrived, I took the liberty of making the decision."</p><p>Senior Pei snorted. "You keep everything from me.  Isn't it up to your Xin Clan to decide what kind of help is needed?  Countless sects and clans wish to be under my protection.  If it weren't for Brother Xin's sake, do you think your insignificant Xin Clan would catch my eye?"</p><p>"It's not that I intentionally concealed it.  Senior also knows that before my father passed away, he forced me to make a vow not to reveal a single word about this to anyone."</p><p>Young Master Xin's tone was bitter.  "Once we find the place, naturally, the truth will be revealed. Please be patient, Senior."</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang flew closer, stepped into the palace, and first cupped his hands towards Senior Pei, saying with a faint smile, "Senior Pei seems to not welcome me.  Young Master Xin isn't going to break our agreement, is he?"</p><p>He had agreed to Young Master Xin's invitation, firstly to conceal his true intentions, and secondly to borrow the Xin Clan's manpower. As for whether or not to help the Xin Clan with refining, it was neither here nor there.</p><p>During their previous discussion, Young Master Xin had offered two conditions: one was to provide a sufficient amount of Purple Origin Stones, and the other was to invite Qin Sang to become a retainer of the Xin Clan, using the harvest as compensation, which could be considered after they found their target.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't care about the Xin Clan's compensation and casually agreed. But now, it seemed being a retainer wasn't so easy.</p><p>Using one to eliminate the other?</p><p>If Young Master Xin had this intention, he had chosen the wrong target.</p><p>"The Five Elements Alliance is renowned, and Elder Qin is an elder of the Five Elements Alliance, whose skill in the Dao of Refining is rarely matched. Senior Pei will probably have difficulty finding someone who surpasses Elder Qin," Young Master Xin said.</p><p>Senior Pei was impolite to Young Master Xin, but on the surface, he didn't take it out on Qin Sang.  He rose and returned the gesture, saying indifferently, "What's done is done. Why should I act like a villain?  Besides, once you begin your operation, the news will definitely leak out. Where are you going to find a Grandmaster Refiner in such a short time?"</p><p>"We will have to rely heavily on Senior Pei and Elder Qin for this journey," said Young Master Xin from behind the curtain, his figure faintly visible as he bowed.</p><p>Qin Sang offered a noncommittal response.</p><p>Young Master Xin coughed lightly, and the Xin Clan members immediately left the stone platforms, forming ranks in front of the palace.  Qu Zhen also brought his people closer.</p><p>Then, Steward Luo stepped forward and took out a stack of yellow talismans, distributing them to the various leaders. Qu Zhen also received one.</p><p>Along with the talismans, a map was also distributed.</p><p>"Everyone, please hold this talisman and search separately according to the routes marked on the map.  While searching, you must constantly burn this talisman with true essence.  Normally, it will emit a crimson flame.  If the flame shows any abnormality, stay put and immediately send a signal. The future of the Xin Clan depends on you all!" Young Master Xin said solemnly.</p><p>"Elder Qin?"</p><p>Sensing Young Master Xin's gaze, Qin Sang flicked his fingers, sending out several streams of light that landed on the maps in the hands of the various leaders, leaving marks.</p><p>"While you all are searching, please also visit these locations nearby and record the surrounding environment so I can make judgments.  Whoever finds the Earth Flower Jade Dew Vine will be handsomely rewarded by me."</p><p>The marked locations were special places Qin Sang had selected by combining numerous maps.  He would personally visit each one to investigate and then plan his route accordingly.</p><p>Senior Pei kept his eyes closed, meditating, saying nothing, indifferent to Young Master Xin and Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>Everyone bowed in acknowledgment and immediately departed separately.</p><p>Qin Sang also walked out of the palace and said, "I also need to search for medicine on my own, so I'll take my leave first.  If I find anything, I will immediately inform you, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>After a brief farewell, Qin Sang took Qu Zhen and the others and departed.</p><p>Some of the places he had chosen could only be approached by Void Refinement cultivators, so he had to go there personally.</p><p>Taking Qu Zhen and the others deeper, upon reaching a void region, Qin Sang ordered the Heng Sha Society members to split into two groups to explore, keeping only Qu Zhen by his side.</p><p>"Tell me in detail.  Where did you want to invite me before?  Does it have something to do with the Ancient Sword Pavilion?"</p>
