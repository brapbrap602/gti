<h1>**Chapter 160: Corpsefiend**</h1><p>**Chapter 160: Corpsefiend**</p><p>Qin Sang examined the zombie's wounds closely, confirming his suspicions that it was not a naturally formed zombie but a refined corpse meticulously crafted by a cultivator.</p><p>After his examination, Qin Sang rose and dashed behind the stone gate, his gaze shifting to the ground.</p><p>A complete skeleton lay prone on the ground. From its posture, it looked as if it had been running when it suddenly died and collapsed. Dust covered the decaying bones.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned it with his divine sense and found no wounds on the skeleton. It had either been killed by a powerful heart attack or its primordial spirit had been directly erased.</p><p>He had intended to search for any identifying remains on the skeleton, but there was nothing. However, there was a broken black coffin beside it with a large hole torn in the lid by claws.</p><p>This coffin was likely the Dharma artifact used to seal the refined corpse. Its spiritual essence had either waned or it had been destroyed by external forces, leaving only a few pieces of rotten wood. The refined corpse sealed within had broken free and escaped.</p><p>In that case, the zombie from before had been this person's refined corpse. This person was most likely a demonic cultivator skilled in corpse refining techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang knew very little about demonic cultivation and had mostly heard rumors. He had never heard of any disciples of the demonic sects in the Lesser Glacial Region who were proficient in corpse refining techniques or who used this type of coffin to seal refined corpses.</p><p>"Was this person an intruder or the cave's master?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, his gaze fixed on the narrow stone path that led deeper into the cave. Judging by the strength of his refined corpse, this person's cultivation level could not have been very high, and he could not have created such a magnificent cave府.</p><p>There was more than one zombie. Qin Sang ventured deeper and deeper, killing several more zombies, each with varying strengths. He also found a few more skeletons, some intact like the first one and others with shattered vital bones, indicating that they had died from serious injuries.</p><p>Was this the nest of a demonic sect? If they were so skilled in corpse refining techniques, why would they choose a desolate cave filled with Earth Fiend Qi instead of a place rich in Yin Qi?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently as the Earth Fiend Qi pursued him relentlessly. He dared not pause for long and quickly sped toward the depths of the cave. At the same time, he remained vigilant, knowing that where there were zombies, there could be Corpsefiends.</p><p>If this was truly the stronghold of a demonic sect, the Qi Condensation disciples on the outer perimeter could only refine zombies, while the Foundation Establishment disciples were capable of refining Corpsefiends.</p><p>If he were to encounter a powerful Corpsefiend, it would be a truly difficult situation.</p><p>Even more terrifying was the Flying Night Rakshasa. If such monsters existed in the depths of the cave, none of them would survive.</p><p>After passing through several stone paths, Qin Sang still hadn't encountered anyone or seen any traces or marks left behind. In the blink of an eye, he reached the end of another stone path. Just as he was about to enter, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>At the end of the path was a stone hall. This was the first time Qin Sang had seen such a stone hall since entering the cave. Several stone paths connected to the entrance, and at the back of the hall were two imposing black iron doors.</p><p>The iron doors were tightly shut, and on them was etched an image of an ancient corpse—one that Qin Sang had never seen before.</p><p>In the image, the ancient corpse was unusually tall and possessed the ability to fly. It soared through the clouds with billowing Fiend Qi, yet it was quite different from a Flying Night Rakshasa. The ancient corpse had a gaunt face, and its two fangs were several inches long. Its漆黑 eyes seemed to possess a mind of their own and emitted a fierce and murderous aura.</p><p>When Qin Sang's gaze met those eerie eyes, his mind trembled slightly, and he hurriedly averted his gaze. He was secretly surprised at the凶厉 aura of the ancient corpse in the image. Merely its portrait possessed such an imposing presence.</p><p>The interior of the stone hall was in ruins, with shattered stone chairs, stone tables, coffin boards, and bones scattered everywhere. Most noticeable were a dozen or so refined corpses roaming the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across these refined corpses, and his expression suddenly became solemn as he fixed his gaze on the one in the middle.</p><p>This refined corpse was as ugly as the others, with a ghostly face and fangs, but its body was much taller and sturdier. Black Qi lingered around it constantly, and its physical body was clearly stronger than the other refined corpses.</p><p>"Corpsefiend?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. His guess had come true; there were indeed Corpsefiends in the depths of the cave. Among the skeletons, there were likely Foundation Establishment cultivators' remains, but they were all broken beyond recognition and mixed together, making them difficult to identify.</p><p>"No! That's not right!"</p><p>Qin Sang then realized that this Corpsefiend was different from the ones described in legends. The black Qi缠绕 its body was not Yin Qi but Earth Fiend Qi!</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized the Corpsefiend with astonishment. This was the first time he had heard of a Corpsefiend refined using Earth Fiend Qi. How was it different from an ordinary Corpsefiend?</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang emerged from the entrance to the stone hall.</p><p>The heavy door made of black iron was tightly shut, obviously less easy to open than the previous stone doors; opening the black iron door would inevitably disturb these refined corpses, so first, the stone palace had to be cleaned out.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang appeared, all the refined corpses in the stone palace were alerted, and a dozen-some refined corpses with ghost-faced and fanged grimaces abruptly turned around, their black eyes all staring fixedly at Qin Sang. The scene was exceedingly eerie.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qin Sang had long since consecrated his Five Elements Sword Formation; without waiting for these refined corpses to make a move, the Five Elements Sword Formation shot out with great speed.</p><p>There was no need to use full strength against these refined corpses; the five spirit swords parted as if in a flash, each drawing on the Five Elements spirit force, transforming into five beams of sword light that wove flexibly through the multitude of refined corpses. One by one, heads fell, and in the blink of an eye, all the zombies were beheaded by Qin Sang and collapsed lifelessly to the ground, with only that one evil corpse remaining.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The evil corpse abruptly brandished its ghost claws, lightning-fast, striking the spirit sword that had pierced it.</p><p>The spirit sword quivered slightly, its forward momentum coming to a standstill.</p><p>The sword light and ghost claws collided, actually deadlocking with each other; the evil qi on the ghost claws was impacted by the sword light, dispersing for the most part, and the tip of the sword pierced the ghost claws but only left a cut, failing to pierce the ghost claws through.</p><p>Moreover, after the spirit sword withdrew, new evil qi immediately gushed out from the cut in the ghost claws, and the cut closed up at a speed visible to the naked eye, completely healing in the twinkling of an eye.</p><p>Was it actually able to heal itself by drawing on the earth evil qi? I wonder if there’s a limit?</p><p>Qin Sang was just about to continue controlling two spirit swords to test the evil corpse’s abilities, when suddenly his eyes flickered, and with a calm expression he activated the Firmament’s Tears, forming a protective cover over his whole body.</p><p>Then with no further hesitation, the Five Elements Sword Formation moved as one, five spirit forces merging to become a single boundlessly mighty beam of sword light that ruthlessly pierced toward the evil corpse.</p><p>The evil corpse reacted extremely swiftly, crossing its arms to block the Five Elements Sword Formation. Innumerable earth evil qi from its body gushed toward the Five Elements Sword Formation, like a swarm of bees, and from its throat came a dreadful wail.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang retrieved the Blood Saber, his figure flashing as he appeared behind the evil corpse, the saber light like lightning as he ruthlessly slashed at the evil corpse’s back. He attacked with his full strength, immediately leaving a cut in the evil corpse’s back.</p><p>As predicted, earth evil qi immediately gushed out of the cut.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression didn’t change as he divided his attention, manipulating the Five Elements Sword Formation to unceasingly attack the evil corpse, giving it no chance to consider anything else.</p><p>Then, one saber strike after another continuously struck the same spot in the cut, and before long, the earth evil qi became increasingly thin, and the speed of the cut’s healing slowed down drastically.</p>
