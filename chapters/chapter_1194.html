<h1>Chapter 1186: Soul-Shattering Spike</h1><p>Outside the Cold Bell Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Lin appeared, one after the other. Before Jing Lin, a green light shimmered, emanating from a green jade bracelet—a treasure known as the Wind-Summoning Bracelet. Meanwhile, Qin Sang was surrounded by twelve demon banners.</p><p>To deal with the old demon Pei, who was protected by the Shadow Crystal Tower, they had only one chance. Qin Sang immediately summoned the twelve demon banners to ensure success. Now that he had reached the Nascent Soul stage, there was no need to hide his strength any longer. Revealing some of his power at the right moment could deter those with ill intentions. Moreover, the twelve demon banners were not his only trump card.</p><p>Their plan was simple: while Jing Lin took advantage of the moment when Pei's attention was drawn to another battlefield, he would break through the protective barrier formed by the Shadow Crystal Tower. Then, Qin Sang would unleash demonic flames to kill Pei. The Shadow Crystal Tower's protective power would be at its weakest when Pei was distracted by the battle against Si Di.</p><p>Jing Lin took the lead.</p><p>The moment they appeared, he pushed his hands forward with force. The Wind-Summoning Bracelet emitted a howling sound, transforming into a gust of green wind that rushed toward the Shadow Crystal Tower at incredible speed. This was no ordinary wind—it was a spiritual wind conjured by Jing Lin's full-powered activation of the treasure. Though it appeared less ferocious than a storm, its power was not to be underestimated.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>In an instant, the Wind-Summoning Bracelet reached the barrier. The Shadow Crystal Tower trembled, and the barrier glowed with a dark light. Pei, caught off guard, had no time to react. The tower itself launched a counterattack, with dense black light surging toward the point of impact to resist the spiritual wind's assault.</p><p>Jing Lin had planned this for a long time and had struck with all his might. If the barrier could be so easily blocked, it would be a disgrace to his reputation as a Nascent Soul cultivator! At this moment, the Wind-Summoning Bracelet shone with a green light, resembling a massive wind tunnel. A continuous stream of spiritual wind poured out from the treasure, instantly transforming into a terrifying hurricane.</p><p>With a slight tremble, the Wind-Summoning Bracelet gathered all the spiritual wind's power and slammed into the barrier.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The deafening roar that Chan Ling and Tan Laomo heard was this very sound!</p><p>The three Shadow Crystal Towers shook violently. The fierce collision sent shockwaves rippling in all directions, causing the low-level cultivators nearby to tumble and fall.</p><p>The barrier cracked.</p><p>The Shadow Crystal Towers were more resilient than expected. The Wind-Summoning Bracelet failed to completely destroy the barrier, which began to repair itself. However, the demonic flames that followed soon after overwhelmed the barrier, shattering it completely!</p><p>A horrifying gap was torn open in the barrier, and the hurricane and demonic flames poured in.</p><p>Qin Sang's hand seals changed rapidly. The twelve demon banners fluttered wildly, and the demonic flames surged, as if the banners themselves were on fire. The Nine Nether Demonic Flames transformed into a black fire dragon, roaring ferociously. Under the horrified gazes of countless onlookers, it charged toward Pei's hiding place with unstoppable force!</p><p>The sudden turn of events was too fast.</p><p>Pei, as if waking from a dream, realized he had been tricked!</p><p>From the moment Qin Sang and Jing Lin appeared, to the barrier being broken, and the demonic fire dragon rushing toward him, it all happened in the blink of an eye. By the time he reacted, it was already too late. The crisis was right before him!</p><p>No, it was despair!</p><p>Feeling the aura of the Nine Nether Demonic Flames, Pei's face was filled with terror. The power of the demonic flames was too terrifying. Any means he could currently employ would be utterly useless against such flames. Pei had no doubt about his fate.</p><p>This was almost certainly a death sentence!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The demonic flames arrived.</p><p>Pei's protective spiritual barrier was instantly shattered. The demonic flames engulfed everything, leaving him no time to even release his Nascent Soul.</p><p>At the critical moment, Pei did not sit idly by. His eyes filled with unwillingness and deep resentment, and he suddenly let out a piercing, ear-splitting howl!</p><p>The howl was sharp and shrill. Pei, now disheveled and looking like a madman, seemed to be letting out a desperate cry before his death.</p><p>However, Qin Sang and Jing Lin felt a sense of foreboding!</p><p>Without seeing Pei perform any secret technique, a strange shadow suddenly emerged from the back of his head. The shadow split into three parts and shot out, instantly merging into the crystal spheres atop the Shadow Crystal Towers.</p><p>In the next moment, Pei suddenly aged several hundred years. His hair turned snow-white, and his face was covered in wrinkles.</p><p>A dignified Nascent Soul Patriarch had turned into a decrepit old man!</p><p>His vitality had been completely drained by that shadow, sacrificed to the Shadow Crystal Towers.</p><p>At the same time, the three Shadow Crystal Towers suddenly erupted with intense black light. Endless darkness surged toward the crystal spheres at the top of the towers, turning them pitch black, like three demonic eyes.</p><p>The eerie sight sent shivers down everyone's spines.</p><p>The Shadow Crystal Towers emitted a faint, peculiar fluctuation. The black light burst forth, transforming into two black spikes that appeared before Qin Sang and Jing Lin as if teleporting.</p><p>Sensing the fluctuation from the Shadow Crystal Towers, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically.</p><p>This fluctuation and the spikes were something he had never encountered before, yet they felt vaguely familiar!</p><p>"Beware the Soul-Shattering Spikes!" Jing Lin urgently warned.</p><p>Without hesitation, he crushed a spiritual talisman, which transformed into a small round shield.</p><p>The Soul-Shattering Spikes were one of the Shadow Crystal Towers' attack methods, specifically targeting the soul. They were difficult to defend against and had caused significant trouble for the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Two Domains Alliance.</p><p>Later, the Two Domains Alliance developed a talisman called the Mystic Shield Talisman, which changed the situation.</p><p>Since they were ambushing Pei, they had naturally considered all possibilities and had the Mystic Shield Talisman ready.</p><p>Qin Sang also instinctively crushed a Mystic Shield Talisman, but his expression remained grave, and his heart was in turmoil.</p><p>He had realized the source of that familiar feeling!</p><p>At the Seven Slaughter Palace, beneath the Heaven-Leaning Peak, within the Demon-Sealing Space.</p><p>The elder from the Four Saints Palace had escaped using the Heavenly Phoenix Feather. Everyone had been closing in on the Demon Lord, and the situation had seemed favorable. But suddenly, the Demon Lord merged with his split soul and unleashed an unknown divine ability, instantly reversing the situation!</p><p>Ling Zhu Zi, the Demon Lord, the Great Shaman, and Fang Laomo—all of them were among the top cultivators of the Canglang Sea—were severely injured, without exception.</p><p>Qin Sang still didn't know that this divine ability was called *Soul-Sundering Slash*.</p><p>The reason everyone had been so easily defeated was that the *Soul-Sundering Slash* directly harmed the soul, making it extremely insidious. Moreover, it was wielded by the ancient Demon Lord.</p><p>That despairing scene was still fresh in Qin Sang's memory.</p><p>The Shadow Crystal Towers and the Soul-Shattering Spikes, whether in appearance or aura, were completely different from the *Soul-Sundering Slash*, and their power was far inferior.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had read about the Shadow Crystal Towers, he had never connected them to the *Soul-Sundering Slash*.</p><p>Now, standing on the battlefield and personally sensing the fluctuation of the Shadow Crystal Towers, he still couldn't find concrete evidence linking the two. But his intuition told him that the Soul-Shattering Spikes and the Demon Lord's divine ability were definitely related!</p><p>This was truly chilling.</p><p>He didn't know if the *Soul-Sundering Slash* was a divine ability unique to the Demon Lord.</p><p>Could there be a Demon Lord behind the Sin Abyss?</p><p>But if there really was a Demon Lord, not only would the Heavenly Alliance be in danger, but the Sin Abyss could easily conquer the entire North Star Realm.</p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>But the current situation left no room for further contemplation.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The Soul-Shattering Spike reached Jing Lin.</p><p>The small shield conjured by the Mystic Shield Talisman was pierced by the spike!</p><p>Although Jing Lin had suspected that Pei's desperate attack might not be so simple, he hadn't expected the Mystic Shield Talisman to be so easily broken.</p><p>In the next moment, the Soul-Shattering Spike shot toward Jing Lin under his shocked gaze!</p>
