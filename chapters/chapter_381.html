Chapter 374: Ambush


“My friends, my task ends here. Beyond this point, either I lack the ability to scout further, or the dangers are too great. You must proceed on your own.”


Kong Xin produced three jade slips, making rough markings on the map before handing them over.


Qin Sang scanned the jade slips with her spiritual sense. She found that the location of the Yellow Dragon Grass was northeast of their current position.  A direct path, assuming no danger, would take several hours.


The Yellow Dragon Grass grew not far from the second layer of the Wuyaya Valley.


The so-called three layers of the valley don’t actually represent distinct changes in terrain. Instead, they're divisions created by ancient restrictions within the valley, a term that evolved over time.


Between the first and second layers are several well-known paths through the restrictions, all marked on the map Qin Sang purchased from Tianfeng Tower.


However, no path before the third layer of the Wuyaya Valley is considered safe.


“This is the remaining payment. Thank you for guiding us.”


Yunyouzi tossed a pouch to Kong Xin and, along with Qin Sang, departed on their flying swords.


Before leaving, Qin Sang glanced at Kong Xin and his companions.


Throughout their journey, their pursuers had never appeared, making their presence feel like mere coincidence.


However, as long as the pursuers weren’t targeting them, they didn’t bother to investigate.  Yunyouzi’s main task was paramount.


…


A dense forest, towering ancient trees, lush and green.


Such a sight was uncommon in the Wuyaya Valley.  The valley was rife with chaos, and these ancient trees must have been incredibly lucky to survive without destruction.


An unnatural silence hung in the forest, not a sound to be heard. The stillness was unsettling.


Suddenly, a flying sword landed before the forest, revealing a figure—the cultivator surnamed Bao, who had parted ways with Qin Sang and the others.


He held a jade slip in his hand.  After studying the forest and comparing it to his map, a look of surprise crossed his face.


“Not a single beast encountered along the way. Lucky…”


The cultivator surnamed Bao muttered to himself, putting away the jade slip before summoning a flying sword.


The sword flashed, heading straight into the forest.


Just as the sword was about to reach the trees, ripples appeared in space.  The scene before the cultivator distorted, the trees breaking apart like reflections in water.


The forest was, in fact, an illusion created by an ancient restriction.


The cultivator's eyes sharpened. He poured all his energy into breaking the illusion.  The restriction didn’t retaliate, and the cultivator, relieved, studied the scene within the illusion.


Beneath the illusion was a narrow canyon, similar to a一线天 (a natural chasm).  The canyon was damp, dark, and extremely narrow. It seemed peaceful enough, without apparent danger, but strange sounds emanated constantly from its depths.


The sounds, amplified by the canyon, were exceptionally eerie.


The cultivator's expression turned worried, but he didn’t stop.  He continued to use his sword to dispel the illusion.


But the moment the illusion broke, things took a sharp turn.


A streak of sharp blue light shot out from the depths of the canyon, impossibly fast.


The blue light contained a familiar-looking flying sword.


The cultivator’s face changed, but he reacted swiftly, his body twisting. However, the attacker had chosen his moment impeccably. The cultivator managed to dodge only a few times before the flying sword pierced him.


Surprisingly, no blood flowed from the wound.


Simultaneously, a few feet behind, the cultivator reappeared, his breath ragged but otherwise unharmed.


The sword had pierced a clone.


A figure emerged from the canyon, retrieving the flying sword, his expression dark as he watched the cultivator.  He hadn’t expected his carefully chosen moment to be so easily countered.


“Kong Xin!”


The cultivator surnamed Bao recognized the man and wasn't surprised. He coldly snorted, “I always knew you were no good!”


“Not so! Not so!”


Kong Xin shook his head in denial. “I’ve always followed the rules, hence my good reputation in the Wuyaya Valley. This time, I’m only acting out of necessity; I need to borrow some of your essence…”


Before he could finish, a flush spread across Kong Xin’s pale face. He clutched his chest and coughed violently, as if trying to expel his lungs.


“So you’re a sickly weakling! And you dare try to murder me!”


The cultivator's eyes lit up.  He sneered, attacking without hesitation.


Kong Xin quickly blocked with his sword, but his weakened state made his movements erratic.  Bao pushed back, and as Kong Xin struggled, his breathing grew increasingly labored.


Kong Xin suddenly shouted, "Don't you dare stand there watching!  Are you waiting for a better moment?"

The cultivator surnamed Bao was startled.

Behind him, a cackling laugh echoed, "Old Brother Kong, I thought you were strong enough to handle this yourself.  I didn't expect to have to help…"

The air twisted, and a figure in black robes materialized from thin air, blocking Bao's escape route.

Kong Xin coldly snorted, "Less chatter!  We need to finish this quickly! If we miss our chance, the others will escape."

The man in black robes complained, "If you hadn't changed the plan and brought them out of the cave prematurely, I wouldn't have wasted my time. They should already be dead! Why all the fuss?"

"You don't understand!"

Kong Xin raged, "How was I to know such a sharp flying sword existed? I bet my entire fortune with Old Master Ji, trading for the Blue Light Sword, which could only leave a shallow scratch on stone! That fellow's sword, however, sliced right through!  Do you think I didn't want to delay?  Luring them into the cave already aroused suspicion; any sudden move would have gotten us all killed!"

The man in black exclaimed, "What? Old Master Ji's Blue Light Sword is one of the sharpest top-grade magical weapons.  Is there something sharper? What grade is it? Could it be a treasure?"

"I saw how effortlessly he wielded his sword. It's not a treasure, I think some special material was added…"

…

The two men conversed without a care in the world, completely ignoring Bao.

Bao's expression grew darker. From their conversation, he understood – Kong Xin's ambition was far greater than he’d imagined; he'd intended to wipe them all out in the cave.

Luckily, Daoist Qingfeng's flying sword was sharp enough. If Kong Xin had delayed any longer, everyone would have been exhausted and fallen victim to their plan.

Bao knew he had to escape these two quickly, or his chances of survival were slim. The man in black was mysterious and unpredictable, but Kong Xin's injuries were real.

With this in mind, Bao suddenly flew off on his sword, choosing to break through in Kong Xin's direction.

Facing Bao's desperate attack, Kong Xin's expression didn't change. A flash of blood appeared between his brows, like a seal being broken, and his aura exploded.
