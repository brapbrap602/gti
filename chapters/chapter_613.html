<h1>Chapter 606 The Black Tower</h1><p>“You five, close off your senses and sit on this cloud,” Dongyang Bo stood up, suddenly summoning a purple cloud, and said to Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were startled, looked at each other, dared not disobey Dongyang Bo’s orders, nor dared to ask more questions, so they flew onto the purple cloud and closed their senses.</p><p>The world fell into darkness, unaware of everything outside.</p><p>Chen Yan glanced at them, and said faintly, “Daoist Dongyang is really cautious, not even trusting his own disciples?”</p><p>“It’s not that I don’t trust them, it’s just a precaution.”</p><p>Dongyang Bo raised his hand, and the purple cloud carrying Qin Sang and the four others followed behind him.</p><p>“The entrance to this secret passage keeps moving around the Tian Shan mountain. This time it's at the lake bottom; next time, it might be under an ancient tree. Only I know how to find it.”</p><p>“However, the exit of the secret passage is fixed.”</p><p>“I don’t want to be ambushed and killed when I come out of the secret passage next time.”</p><p>“That red-haired old fellow has coveted this secret passage for a long time. Even during the time of the previous Pure Yang Sect Master and my master, they fought over this passage and the key in my possession. Luckily, this secret passage doesn't touch the core, saving the trouble of breaking the formation. Otherwise, this unworthy descendant wouldn't be alive today.”</p><p>“That old man is both righteous and wicked. If they accidentally leak the secret after going out, and get caught by Pure Yang Cave and have their souls searched, it wouldn't be surprising.”</p><p>“Knowing nothing is actually better for them.”</p><p>Chen Yan said calmly, “Daoist, does that mean that when we exit the secret passage, I will also have to close my senses before you feel at ease?”</p><p>Dongyang Bo smiled, shook his head slightly, “If you don't know how to get out, how can Miss Chen Yan rest assured? How could I force you? You and your master are not cultivators from Xiao Han region. Your presence here is merely accidental. With your strength and background, after you rescue your master, there shouldn't be anything worth lingering over in Xiao Han region, right? Miss Chen Yan has resided on Shaohua Mountain for two hundred years, and I have never mistreated you. I not only collected cultivation resources for you but also helped you search for your master. What reason do you have to betray me?”</p><p>Chen Yan was silent for a moment, then said, “After leaving Ziwei Palace, I will swear on my heart demon not to reveal the secret passage to anyone, including my master.”</p><p>“That’s the best!”</p><p>Dongyang Bo nodded, took the purple cloud, and flew towards the depths of the secret passage.</p><p>Chen Yan quickly followed.</p><p>Along the way, they passed unimpeded, encountering no restrictions or battles. The five people on the purple cloud sat securely, being carried through the air.</p><p>The secret passage had been cleaned thoroughly, without a single item left behind.</p><p>After many twists and turns, they suddenly came across a wall built of blue bricks, completely blocking the path ahead.</p><p>Dongyang Bo glanced at Chen Yan, cast several hand seals in front of her, and embedded them into the wall. Then the wall rippled like water, with faint light shimmering, becoming almost transparent, turning into a water wall.</p><p>On the other side of the water wall was a dilapidated hall, silent and empty.</p><p>Chen Yan and Dongyang Bo passed through the water wall and appeared in the hall. Looking back, the water wall had disappeared, transforming back into a blue brick wall, its surface mottled and showing its age.</p><p>The brick wall was unremarkable; no one would have guessed that a secret passage was hidden there.</p><p>Exiting the hall,</p><p>Dark clouds obscured the sun, limiting their vision to a short distance.</p><p>They seemed to be on the peak of Tian Shan Mountain, deep in the clouds, but the surroundings were calm, and there were no signs of turbulence above.</p><p>This was very different from other parts of Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Nearby were buildings similar to the hall they had just exited, arranged neatly. Ancient palaces stood side by side; in such a place, no one would notice anything unusual about a wall.</p><p>In the depths of the clouds, shadowy figures loomed, mysterious.</p><p>Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan were not curious about this place. After observing for a moment, they flew directly upwards with a clear objective.</p><p>There were some places they dared not enter rashly, forcing them to take detours.</p><p>The higher they went, the more imposing the palaces became.  Though the ornate decorations were dilapidated, the buildings themselves remained, displaying their grandeur.</p><p>“We’re here!”</p><p>Dongyang Bo pointed ahead.</p><p>In the depths of the clouds, a pool of water came into view. The pavilion that should have been at the edge of the pool was severely damaged, with rubble everywhere, a horrifying sight.</p><p>Across the pool, stood a tall, slender tower.</p><p>This tower, a hundred zhang high, is entirely black, its surface seemingly radiating a dark aura that seems to draw in even one's gaze—an unsettling sight.  Four exceptionally thick iron chains, extending from the tower's peak to the ground, secure it at each corner.  These chains are heavily rusted, bearing the marks of time and indecipherable runes.</p><p>The black tower stands alone; no ancient temple graces its surroundings.</p><p>At the sight of the tower, Chen Yan's usually calm eyes, still as an ancient well, flared with intense excitement.</p><p>Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan swiftly crossed the pool and landed before the tower's base.</p><p>Chen Yan approached alone, gently running her hand over the door, feeling its chill.  She then looked up, her gaze sweeping upwards, past layer upon layer of the tower, towards its summit.</p><p>Dongyang Bo watched her for a moment before speaking.</p><p>“Miss Chen Yan, you see now just how powerful the restrictions on this door are. I wasn’t lying, was I?</p><p>“The restrictions grow stronger with each level.</p><p>“Your master was an exception.  Now, even combined, the Xiaohan Domain and the Tianxing League lack a late-Yuan Ying cultivator. Only he possessed the strength to ascend the tower alone.</p><p>“Even using the Five Elements Beast Seal cleverly, we'd need at least two Yuan Ying cultivators to have a chance of opening that door.  Therefore, to rescue him, you must break through to the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>“You shouldn't blame me for pushing you back then, should you?”</p><p>As he spoke, Dongyang Bo’s gaze casually swept over Qin Sang, a strange smile playing on his lips.</p><p>Qin Sang, seated on the purple cloud, his senses still sealed, remained unaware.</p><p>Chen Yan sensed the undercurrent in Dongyang Bo's words.  She turned sharply, her expression darkening, and stared at him.  “I take responsibility for my own actions! I made my own choice and will not, nor should I, blame others. What are you trying to say?”</p><p>“It’s good that Miss Chen Yan doesn't blame me. I feared that unresolved feelings might become a demon for you, and that would be my fault... I spoke out of turn.”</p><p>Dongyang Bo chuckled, saying no more.  With a flick of his finger, he unleashed a burst of true energy, dispersing the purple cloud and simultaneously forcibly releasing Qin Sang and the others from their sensory deprivation.</p><p>Qin Sang and the four others fell to the ground, their senses restored.  They quickly regained their footing, eagerly looking around.</p><p>Both the ancient temples within the sea of mist and the black tower before them held immense appeal.</p>
