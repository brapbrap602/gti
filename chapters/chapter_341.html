<h1>Chapter 334: Reunion of Old Friends</h1><p>Tan Hao flew with all his might, but the difference in cultivation was too great, and the masked man easily caught up.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gust of wind, powerful as a thunderbolt, struck from behind.</p><p>Tan Hao was startled. Without pausing, he hurriedly tossed a shield artifact behind him.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>A sharp, metallic sound rang out.</p><p>The masked man's flying sword easily knocked the shield away. After a brief pause, the sword flashed again, continuing its pursuit of Tan Hao.</p><p>One artifact after another was thrown out, either deflected or destroyed by the flying sword. The distance between the two not only failed to widen but actually grew shorter.</p><p>"Keep running. Let's see how much further you can go…"</p><p>The masked man's mocking voice rang out, close at hand.</p><p>Having been deceived by Tan Hao and forced to take such a long detour, the masked man's fury remained unabated. Like a cat playing with a mouse, he intended to toy with Tan Hao to vent his frustration.</p><p>A fierce look flashed across Tan Hao's face. His escape light abruptly stopped, and he suddenly turned around. With a flick of his wrist, he threw out a stack of talismans.</p><p>A resounding dragon's roar echoed.</p><p>The talismans were all inscribed with the same spell. As they shattered, a dozen ice dragons materialized, roaring towards the sky.</p><p>With menacing roars, they lunged at the masked man with claws outstretched.</p><p>These imposing ice dragons formed a formidable dragon formation, working together to ensnare the masked man.</p><p>The masked man, who had been holding back and was prepared, calmly weaved through the ice dragons. His flying sword circled him, emitting sharp bursts of sword energy. Each strike precisely targeted the dragons' weak points.</p><p>With a series of explosions and frustrated roars, the ice dragons were decapitated one by one. Their bodies disintegrated into icy fragments, scattering like falling snow.</p><p>The scene was quite beautiful.</p><p>However, Tan Hao was in no mood to admire the scenery. His last resort had been easily countered, failing to even scratch the masked man.</p><p>This was the difference between Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment.</p><p>He lacked powerful artifacts and talismans, lacked profound techniques and spells. He couldn't bridge this gap.</p><p>Tan Hao gave up struggling. He looked southwest, his gaze seemingly piercing through the endless swamp, towards his cave and the only family he had waiting there.</p><p>He had bought the Tranquility Pill, but he would never be able to deliver it.</p><p>From the moment he decided to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield as a Qi Refining cultivator, Tan Hao had foreseen this day.</p><p>Without reaching Foundation Establishment, survival in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was a constant struggle.</p><p>For years, the mask had helped him deter opponents and escape danger, allowing him to survive in this perilous place. But the mask wasn't万能的, and this day had finally arrived.</p><p>His eyes held not despair, but a sense of resignation and relief.</p><p>Tan Hao sighed softly, murmuring, "Xiao Jie, big brother will go ahead and scout the path for you…"</p><p>He held a dagger in his right hand, a final gift for himself.</p><p>The cultivation world had countless methods of torture, some of which were the most cruel punishments imaginable.  The thought of them was enough to make one's hair stand on end. He could clearly sense the masked man's hatred. He would rather die than fall into his hands!</p><p>He would rather choose death over unimaginable torment.</p><p>Tan Hao had long accepted this possibility.</p><p>Just as he was about to raise his arm, a sudden, piercing scream erupted from within the swirling ice particles.</p><p>It was the masked man!</p><p>Tan Hao froze, his face filled with disbelief. He knew his own limitations; those talismans couldn't possibly cause the masked man such pain, unless…</p><p>‘Swoosh!’</p><p>A slender, emerald green flying sword, dripping with blood, emerged from the ice.</p><p>The warm blood instantly froze upon contact with the ice fragments, turning into crimson specks. The flying sword nimbly turned and flew back.</p><p>The next moment…</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>A nearby tree shuddered.</p><p>The flying sword pinned a corpse to the trunk.</p><p>The corpse was already coated in a thin layer of ice, but two deep sword wounds on its chest remained vividly red.</p><p>The masked man's eyes were wide open in terror and disbelief. Clearly, he had been caught completely off guard by the surprise attack and hadn't had time to react before being slain.</p><p>This was the first divine ability of the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture," the Shadowless Flight.</p><p>The masked man, confident in his victory and focused on toying with Tan Hao, hadn't noticed the Ebony Wood Sword approaching, meeting his demise unexpectedly.</p><p>Opportunities to use the Ebony Wood Sword for a sneak attack against opponents of the same realm were rare, but against lower-level cultivators, this divine ability was incredibly effective!</p><p>There was no need for the Talisman Treasure or the Ten Kings Yama Banner.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword disdainfully dropped the masked man's corpse into the mire. Sword energy wrapped around the man's storage pouch and flew back.</p><p>The decaying mire quickly swallowed and consumed the body, leaving no trace.</p><p>A figure emerged from behind a tree, retrieving the flying sword and the storage pouch. After a cursory glance inside, the figure shook their head in disappointment, pocketed it, and looked up at Tan Hao.</p><p>From the brink of death to the masked man's sudden demise, the situation had taken an unexpected turn. Tan Hao now understood that he had witnessed a double-cross.</p><p>Tan Hao's face was a mix of surprise and uncertainty. He couldn't be sure whether this new development was good or bad.</p><p>Whoever killed the masked man so easily must be even stronger.</p><p>Both the masked man and this mysterious figure could easily kill him. However, unlike the masked man, this person hadn't immediately tried to kill him. Perhaps there was a chance for survival.</p><p>Feeling the stranger's gaze upon him from beneath the cloak, Tan Hao's heart tightened. He hurriedly offered his own storage pouch, bowing deeply.  "Thank you, Senior, for saving my life. I have nothing to repay you with but my meager possessions. I hope you will not disdain them."</p><p>He waited, but his storage pouch remained untouched.</p><p>The mysterious figure stood motionless, showing no intent to kill.</p><p>The uncertainty was agonizing.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Tan Hao, pondered for a moment, and finally removed his cloak, revealing his face. "Tan Hao, it's been years. Do you remember your old friend?"</p><p>Tan Hao stared, stunned.  He looked at Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Confusion flickered in his eyes, then recognition sparked, rekindling distant memories. After all, Qin Sang's appearance hadn't changed drastically in decades.</p><p>"You're... Qin…"</p><p>Tan Hao pointed at Qin Sang, utterly astonished.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, sighing with emotion. "Decades have passed. I never thought we would meet again like this, Brother Tan. How have you been?"</p>
