<h1>Chapter 832: Ambush</h1><p>“Old Man Mou…”</p><p>Qin Sang remembered this person.</p><p>The man in black armor, sent by the Huntian Island Master to guard the Dongming Cold Flame, had mentioned that Old Man Mou was interested in the Dongming Cold Flame, and the Huntian Island Master had asked him to subdue it.</p><p>Old Man Mou was a powerful figure in the demonic path, long established in his reputation.</p><p>“Unexpectedly, the Dongming Cold Flame has already been taken. This person must be extremely skilled in controlling fire…”</p><p>Qin Sang felt regret.</p><p>He knew very well that all of Elder Dongming’s relics had been destroyed by the Dongming Cold Flame, and only this Cold Flame remained, a treasure beyond compare.</p><p>…</p><p>The journey was relatively smooth; they didn't encounter any beast tide attacks and arrived at an island called Yu Heng Island.</p><p>Qin Sang and Madam Liu disguised their identities and landed on the island. With the help of Madam Liu's friend, they entered the city.</p><p>This friend is also a female cultivator, named Jin Ying. She is pretty and has been monitoring Xiang Yi's activities on the island.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, her eyes showed some displeasure; she seemed distrustful of his abilities. Although she masked it well, Qin Sang noticed it.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly understood the reason. They had missed an opportunity last time because they couldn't contact him, hence the dissatisfaction.</p><p>“This is the Qingfeng Daoist I often mentioned to you.”</p><p>The three of them hurried back to Jin Ying's cave dwelling. Madam Liu introduced them, “Daoist, this is my junior sister Jin Ying. I was once a disciple of a sect and became close friends with her. She’s now a manager at the Nine Stars Guild. Over the years, she’s helped me conceal my true identity, preventing Xiang Yi from discovering me. This time, we need Jin Ying to lure Xiang Yi off the island, giving us a chance to act.”</p><p>So it's the Nine Stars Guild.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently. The Nine Stars Guild is one of the top merchant guilds in the league; Jin Ying certainly has the ability. She’s willing to break with the merchant league and guild to help Madam Liu avenge her husband, demonstrating their profound friendship.</p><p>“Senior sister, you don’t need to say that. If it weren’t for you and Brother Liu’s help back then, I wouldn’t be where I am today.”</p><p>Jin Ying glanced at Qin Sang, then at Madam Liu, and said solemnly, “Xiang Yi is currently on the island. The rulers of several nearby islands are preparing to converge here to defend the island, and the merchant league is also rapidly deploying forces. Xiang Yi can’t leave for now. But before we act, you both must think carefully. If we fail and alert him, not only will Brother Liu’s revenge go unavenged, but Xiang Yi will certainly not let us go. Under these circumstances, being wanted by the merchant league means we can’t return to the Canglang Sea; we’ll be adrift in the Yao Sea, living alongside the demonic beasts.  So, this might be our only chance.”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang understood that Jin Ying's words were directed at him; she still didn't trust his abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly without saying anything.</p><p>Madam Liu smoothed things over, “Junior sister, rest assured. The Daoist can move freely in the Seven Killing Hall and once instantly killed a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. His strength is unquestionable. As long as he can use that Prohibition Talisman, defeating Xiang Yi shouldn't be a problem. But Daoist, don't underestimate him; I must ensure Xiang Yi's complete annihilation to appease my husband's spirit!”</p><p>Madam Liu's tone was firm, her hatred for Xiang Yi palpable.</p><p>“As long as your arrangements are flawless, I am confident I won’t give Xiang Yi a chance to escape.”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped smiling and made a promise. Then he began to understand their plan, “How do you intend to lure Xiang Yi off the island? What if he's not alone and has other experts with him? From what you said earlier, it seems Xiang Yi has several experts sent by the merchant league accompanying him.”</p><p>The two women exchanged glances, and Madam Liu nodded to Jin Ying.</p><p>Out of caution, Jin Ying waved her hand, setting up a soundproofing restriction before explaining in detail, “According to our understanding, Xiang Yi has been searching for a spirit tree called Turtle-Patterned Wood, a little-known spiritual material. This Turtle-Patterned Wood is very unique; it seems to breathe mist like a demonic beast and, every hundred years, erupts, its mist covering a radius of several miles, with a special smell. We’ll create a similar phenomenon in the Yao Sea and use our connections with the Nine Stars Guild and the merchant league to leak the news of the phenomenon to Xiang Yi. As for Xiang Yi's companions…”</p><p>Madam Liu added, “My husband also made some friends during his lifetime.  The fact that Xiang Yi needs the Turtle-Patterned Wood was revealed to me by a friend. Although they fear the league leader and dare not oppose Xiang Yi, they are willing to provide what help they can. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had such smooth sailing. One friend also works for the merchant league and happens to be on the island. Before we act, he will try his best to restrain the merchant league experts, but the assassination must be carried out by us.”</p><p>"Furthermore, Xiang Yi is inherently greedy and cunning. If he's certain a treasure exists, he'll definitely not bring anyone else along, to avoid sharing the spoils..."</p><p>"However... that being said, Xiang Yi might still have accomplices. We can't let our guard down..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. He wasn't one to rely on others.</p><p>Madam Liu sighed, "That's true, but there won't be a better opportunity. We have to take this risk.  Once Xiang Yi returns to seclusion to break through, we'll have no chance at all."</p><p>Qin Sang understood.</p><p>Confident in his ability to escape even if the ambush failed, he didn't say anything more.</p><p>The three of them spent a day strategizing and devising a plan.</p><p>Qin Sang and Madam Liu left Yu Heng Island first, searching for several days before finding a suitable small island where they set up a camouflage illusion array using turtle shell wood.</p><p>Then came the long wait.</p><p>Two months passed before the opportunity finally arrived!</p><p>...</p><p>Outside Yu Heng Island, Qin Sang and Madam Liu anxiously waited.</p><p>Suddenly, the water splashed, and a carp-like sea beast leaped from the water – Jin Ying's tamed spirit beast – spitting out a message talisman.</p><p>"The fish has taken the bait!"</p><p>Madam Liu read aloud.</p><p>Exchanging a look, the two immediately hid themselves.</p><p>They lay in ambush, with Jin Ying relaying messages.  Her strength was insufficient for the ambush itself; she was securing their escape route, allowing for a swift retreat if things went south.</p><p>However, Jin Ying's spirit beast was certainly not as fast as Xiang Yi's escape technique. They only knew the news of the materials had been successfully transmitted. They were unsure when Xiang Yi would arrive, whether he had accomplices, and needed to improvise.</p><p>Qin Sang and Madam Liu separated slightly.</p><p>He held the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring and had the Tian Mu Butterfly activate its celestial eye to scan the sea, so they could detect Xiang Yi's approach in time.</p><p>Time ticked by, each second seeming an eternity.</p><p>Xiang Yi's presence was still absent.</p><p>However, Jin Ying also hadn't sent any new messages, indicating that nothing unexpected had happened.</p><p>With the sea breeze on his face, Qin Sang listened to the waves, his gaze suddenly hardening. In the distance, a meteor-like glow appeared on the ocean surface, rapidly approaching.</p>
