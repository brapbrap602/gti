<h1>Chapter 2004: The Jade Emperor</h1><p>The tide surged fiercely.</p><p>Following the advance of a white line, a wall of water rushed forward, inundating everything. Except for a mountain at the very center of the island, almost everything was submerged beneath the tide.</p><p>Looking towards the direction from which the tide came, one could not see the end of the current.</p><p>The setting sun cast a dim light upon the sky.</p><p>As the tide approached, the area around the island brightened. It turned out that what was seen before wasn't just waves, but also countless points of light.</p><p>These points of light were extremely tiny.  They were actually spirit insects, similar in form to beetles, glowing like fireflies, but much smaller in size.</p><p>Within the swarm, the lights connected, forming a luminous tapestry, like patches of glowing seaweed.</p><p>The insects drifted with the tide; the current seemed to be composed entirely of them. From the surface to the seabed, they were omnipresent and innumerable.</p><p>In an instant, the entire small island, along with Bai Hu who hadn't yet left, was surrounded by the swarm.</p><p>Although no immediate danger was felt from the initial arrival of the tide, the scene itself was sufficiently unnerving.</p><p>Inside the quiet chamber, Qin Sang watched the scene outside, his brow furrowed.</p><p>This spirit insect wasn't listed in the Witcher Insect Manual.  It was clear that the individual capabilities of this spirit insect were weak, as fragile as ants, but their sheer number was astonishing.</p><p>Some special spirit insects, while unremarkable individually, once swarming and proliferating to a certain number, could undergo a collective transformation, developing unimaginable and powerful divine abilities.  These became extremely dangerous, forcing even cultivators to avoid them.</p><p>The Witcher Insect Manual only listed spirit insects with both potent divine abilities and inherent potential – insects powerful enough individually to guide future generations in the Dao of Insect Cultivation.</p><p>It was difficult for cultivators to control this type of spirit insect, so they weren't listed.</p><p>It was unknown what divine abilities these light insects possessed, but judging by Li Er’s reaction, she definitely had a countermeasure.</p><p>"What spirit insects are those in the sea?" Someone couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"These are Tide Messenger Insects. They've finally arrived!"</p><p>Li Er replied crisply, cheering as she leaped into the air.  Mid-air, a series of mechanisms clicked and whirred as she transformed into a Hammerhead Shark.  With a powerful thrust, she plunged towards the sea.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>Water sprayed high into the air.</p><p>Li Er dove into the current, becoming a true Hammerhead Shark, swimming nimbly in the sea.</p><p>The Hammerhead Shark’s skin was covered in dense spots.  These spots were the same size as the Tide Messenger Insects and emitted an identical light. They even mimicked the unique fluctuations of the Tide Messenger Insect swarm.</p><p>The Tide Messenger Insects mistook Li Er for one of their own. The startled swarm immediately converged towards her.</p><p>The spots on Li Er’s body began to flicker faintly, as if possessing a certain magic.  The swarm continuously gathered towards this section of the current, appearing brighter than elsewhere.</p><p>More and more Tide Messenger Insects were attracted, forming a dense patch of luminous tapestry that enveloped Li Er, completely obscuring the distinction between her and the insects.</p><p>Li Er fully integrated into the swarm, drifting with the current alongside them.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a while, but didn't detect anything unusual about the swarm. Moreover, the speed of the current was quite fast. He thought to himself that Canjin City indeed had its methods. He considered himself to have some accumulation in the Dao of Insect Control, but even for him, understanding the habits of this type of spirit insect wouldn't be easy.</p><p>The Tide Messenger Insects made no sound. In the current, there was only the sound of flowing seawater, eerily quiet.  The others also relaxed, entering meditative cultivation.</p><p>This drifting lasted for a full three years.</p><p>During those three years, Li Er never changed into any other form or displayed any identification tokens. Yet, they weren't harassed by any demonic beasts or cultivators.  This indicated that the Tide Messenger Insects weren't entirely harmless, and Li Er must have used some method to deceive the swarm.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>Li Er emerged from the water, transforming back into her white tiger form. Shaking the water from her fur, she raised a paw and waved it towards the swarm. "Goodbye! Thank you for protecting Li Er!"</p><p>The swarm naturally didn't respond to her, but Li Er didn't mind. She stretched her four legs and began to run. Nearing the Great Zhou, the area was noticeably safer, and Li Er began to accelerate.</p><p>Three months later, someone else wanted to disembark.</p><p>"Let this old man down, please. Many thanks to Young Lady Li Er for the escort."</p><p>An elderly man stepped off the “ship”.</p><p>In the fifth month, Zhu Que suddenly woke Qin Sang, excitedly pointing out the window. Qin Sang saw a black line appear on the horizon, extending infinitely in both directions.</p><p>"Esteemed guests, we've reached the shore! The tide arrived early, we're half a year ahead of schedule!"</p><p>Li Er’s voice echoed through the cabin, waking everyone.</p><p>"We've finally reached the Great Zhou!"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but stand up, gazing at the continent.</p><p>Ahead lay the territory of the Great Zhou, the land where the human race thrived.  He wondered what awaited him, whether it would be joy or danger.</p><p>From the remote Moonwash Bay to the Great Zhou, only now had he truly taken his first step into this vast world.</p><p>"Will I encounter old friends in the Great Zhou?"</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze was distant.</p><p>Before, he thought that searching for old friends in this vast world was like searching for a needle in the ocean.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the human race had the Great Zhou Immortal Kingdom, as well as the sacred ground of Jade Capital, essentially the center of the entire human race, the most prominent landmark. Any ascended cultivator, given the chance, would surely want to visit and pay their respects.</p><p>As the center of the human race, the Jade Capital of the Great Zhou was bound to hold more opportunities, undoubtedly attracting countless heroes, gathering them towards it.</p><p>Perhaps ascended cultivators from Storm Realm in the past had also established forces in the Great Zhou, leaving behind their legends.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang longed to see those familiar faces. If they could also reach Jade Capital, they would eventually reunite.</p><p>"Five hundred years…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  Adding the two hundred years in the Talisman Realm, he had 'ascended' for nearly eight hundred years. It was a number unimaginable to a mortal, a span of time in which much could happen.</p><p>"The prefectural city of Azure Shore Prefecture is called Azure Shore City, not far from the South Sea. We'll arrive in three days!"</p><p>Li Er stepped onto land, her body trembling slightly as she spoke excitedly, interrupting Qin Sang’s thoughts.</p><p>The cultivators on board all planned to make their decisions after reaching Azure Shore City, so no one disembarked.</p><p>Stepping onto land, they were greeted by a tall mountain range, stretching along the coast into the distance.</p><p>Wings sprouted from Li Er’s sides as she transformed into a winged tiger. Her vision broadened, taking in the endless undulating mountains that stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><p>"Worthy of being the Gen Province!"</p><p>Qin Sang and the others couldn't help but marvel. The Eight Celestial Provinces were named after the Eight Trigrams, and it seemed they did correspond to the trigram imagery.</p><p>As they journeyed, they saw mortals working below and cultivators traveling back and forth. Overall, it was relatively peaceful.</p><p>On the third day, just past noon, a mountain city came into view. It was Azure Shore City.</p><p>Azure Shore City was built on a mountain, orderly and unremarkable, yet not lacking in any way. It reminded Qin Sang of the immortal cities in the Dao Court's altars.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>Li Er descended from the sky, landing gracefully on all fours upon a high platform within the city.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the presence of guards and formations within the city, but no one stopped them, nor did anyone come to investigate.  This was clearly a privilege granted by Canjin City.</p><p>"We've arrived at Azure Shore City. Li Er’s mission is complete.  Esteemed guests, you may disembark!"</p><p>A door opened in Li Er’s belly, and Qin Sang and the others filed out.</p><p>"Ah! Li Er is finally back!"</p><p>A delighted cry came from below, and a fiery figure flew out. It was a Vermilion Bird.</p><p>This Vermilion Bird was undoubtedly a mechanical beast as well, presumably one of the Crimson Phoenixes Li Er had mentioned earlier.</p><p>"Sister Hong Er, Li Er missed you so much!"</p><p>Li Er hopped over, and the tiger and phoenix embraced tightly, spinning and jumping. Finally, the tiger’s paws rested on the phoenix's wings, and they danced in the air, fully expressing the joy of their reunion.</p><p>Such a pure and sincere scene was rare in the cultivation world.  The older cultivators all smiled kindly.</p><p>"Young Lady Li Er, until we meet again!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed and walked towards the courtyard entrance.</p><p>On their journey, Li Er had given a general introduction to Azure Shore City.  He already had a destination in mind.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please wait," Huai Ting called out from behind him.</p><p>Learning that Huai Ting planned to settle in Azure Shore City first, exploring the surroundings and familiarizing himself before venturing deeper, Qin Sang once again declined Huai Ting’s invitation to travel together.  Huai Ting was an easygoing person, and with a farewell, he turned and left.</p><p>Qin Sang turned down a street, found a few merchant guilds, and purchased several cartography maps. He discovered that the content on them was largely similar, only slightly more detailed than Li Er’s, marking some nearby sects, powers, and forbidden areas, but he would have to discern their veracity himself.</p><p>He casually chose a merchant guild to linger in, chatting with the manager.</p><p>"Sinking Radiance Prefecture is the westernmost prefecture of Gen Province? What lies further west?" Qin Sang asked, pointing at the map.</p><p>"Mountains!"</p><p>The manager replied, drawing a half-circle on the edge of the map.  "Besides the sea, it’s mountains. Endless mountains, endless dangers.  It's said that even between Gen Province and Jade Capital, it’s the same: mountains that would take a lifetime to traverse.  Why else would it be called Gen Province?"</p><p>"Of course, I haven't been there myself. I heard it from a senior. Does Fellow Daoist Qin intend to go to those places?" The manager inquired.</p><p>Qin Sang had decided to use his real name in the Great Zhou, perhaps it would reach the ears of his old friends.</p><p>"I'm afraid it wouldn't be easy, would it?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside, sighing.  "This prefecture is one of the prefectures of Gen Province, yet it doesn't even have a Great Teleportation Formation to other prefectures!"</p><p>The manager chuckled.  "Great Teleportation Formations aren't so easily constructed. Azure Shore Prefecture hasn't even existed for a thousand years yet.  Who knows when our Prefect will have the strength to build one.  Travel will be much more convenient then."</p><p>"Oh?  Our Azure Shore Prefecture is within the Great Zhou's territory, yet the Great Teleportation Formation requires the Prefect to personally arrange its construction?" Qin Sang feign</p>
