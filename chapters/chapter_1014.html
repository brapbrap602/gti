<h1>Chapter 1066: Return</h1><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal his presence.</p><p>The white crane never expected to encounter a cultivator here, and one that seemed hostile.</p><p>Its eyes darted around, then it turned and fled.</p><p>Clearly, it possessed a certain level of intelligence.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction. Three-colored light flashed around him, and he easily intercepted the crane.</p><p>The crane darted left and right, but Qin Sang effortlessly blocked every attempt.</p><p>Unable to break through, the crane became enraged. It flapped its wings and attacked Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang threw a punch, meeting the crane's wing head-on.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang's figure merely trembled, while the crane was sent flying backward, its wings shaking, its eyes filled with shock.</p><p>A flicker of fear appeared in the crane's eyes.  No longer daring to engage, it flapped its wings, sending out two blade-like beams of light before transforming into a white streak and fleeing.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed repeatedly, easily dodging the light blades.</p><p>This time, he didn't rush to intercept the crane. Instead, he unhurriedly pursued it, summoning his Ebony Sword and casually slashing at it from time to time.</p><p>The chase was pure sport.</p><p>Even without using his sword wheel, each casual strike forced the crane into desperate defense.</p><p>It finally understood that the cultivator before it was unfathomably powerful and much faster. Escape was impossible.</p><p>If Qin Sang wanted it to go east, it couldn't go west.</p><p>From rage, the crane descended into despair.</p><p>Finally, after flying an unknown distance, the crane gave up completely. Folding its wings, it plummeted into the sea with a splash, floating motionless on the surface.</p><p>It seemed to have resigned itself to its fate, offering no resistance.</p><p>“Playing dead?”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled inwardly.  He flew to the crane and saw that its eyes were tightly closed, showing no reaction.</p><p>This made Qin Sang curious.</p><p>He summoned the Concentric Rings, extending a finger. The rings flew to the crane's head.</p><p>When he had decided to subdue the crane, he had cleared the rings.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his true essence. The rings glowed brightly, and shadows of the rings rushed towards the crane, binding it. The crane's figure stiffened.</p><p>With Qin Sang's cultivation, suppressing the crane wasn't difficult, but the taming process was usually unavoidable.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when Qin Sang tried to activate the rings to subdue the crane, he met no resistance. The crane had truly accepted its fate, abandoning all resistance and allowing Qin Sang to do as he pleased.</p><p>Qin Sang had never encountered such a straightforward demon. He had intended to use the rings to chastise it, but seeing its cooperation, he couldn't bring himself to do so.</p><p>The crane rolled over, touched the ring around its neck with its claw, and its eyes darted around.</p><p>“You seem clever. Follow me, obey my commands, and work diligently, and you won't suffer. I might even release you eventually…”</p><p>Qin Sang observed the crane.</p><p>It definitely understood; its intelligence was no less than Two-Headed.</p><p>However, the crane's nature was too slippery. Unlike Two-Headed, who would work diligently with a little encouragement, this one would need occasional discipline.</p><p>“Take me to the nearest late Core Formation demon,” Qin Sang commanded.</p><p>The dejected, crestfallen crane suddenly perked up at this command. As if forgetting its own predicament, its eyes lit up, it squawked twice, and eagerly prepared to fly back.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing the crane's excitement, gave it a strange look.  Had he captured a fool?</p><p>Then he guessed the crane's intentions: it wanted to take the opportunity to cause trouble for a rival.</p><p>That demon island wasn't simple. Qin Sang suspected that there might be a transformed demon's lair in its depths. He didn't want to fight there and attract powerful enemies, so he immediately stopped the crane.</p><p>The crane was greatly disappointed.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang felt that he had stayed too long and it was becoming risky. He decided to leave the area.</p><p>The crane looked back wistfully, its cries mournful, as if bidding farewell to its lovers.</p><p>…</p><p>Calling it training was a euphemism; it was more like wandering.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled countless miles across the Demon Sea, experiencing different landscapes, encountering danger several times, and even alarming transformed demons who laid traps to ambush him.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was vigilant enough to escape each time.</p><p>His gains, however, were substantial.</p><p>Before he knew it, the ten-year agreement was almost up.</p><p>On a nameless small island.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from meditation and examined his body.</p><p>After nearly ten years of training, due to his inability to stay in one place for long, apart from his daily star essence body refinement, he hadn't had much time for proper cultivation. However, his comprehension of the Killing Talisman had deepened, and it would be easy to catch up with his cultivation later.</p><p>“The appointed time is near. The Seven Kills Palace will soon appear. I wonder how Bai is doing. It's time to go back…” Qin Sang murmured, calculating the time.</p><p>In his ten years in the Demon Sea, he had accumulated considerable wealth.  Those he personally dealt with were at least Core Formation demons, and their cores and bodies were extremely valuable.</p><p>“I can go to Tianxing Island and do some serious shopping…”</p><p>Qin Sang decided to return to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>He took out a Toxic Algae fruit and fed it to the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>Then he took out a petal from a rare spirit flower he had found and watched tenderly as the Skyeye Butterfly nibbled on it.</p><p>Both spirit insects were still in the middle stage of their third transformation.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm had eaten so many Toxic Algae fruits, yet showed no sign of breaking through, and the Skyeye Butterfly was still far from it, unlikely before entering the Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>After feeding the spirit insects, Qin Sang walked out of his cave.  Not seeing the crane, he activated the Concentric Rings.</p><p>Soon, a streak of white light flew towards him from the distant sea. It was the crane.</p><p>The crane flew swiftly, landing beside Qin Sang. It looked left and right, full of energy, shaking its feathers and scattering a few red ones.</p><p>“Where have you been?”</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. “If you cause any trouble, don't expect me to clean it up!”</p><p>At first, the crane had been lazy, but after being severely punished a few times, it became quite obedient, though it couldn't shake its womanizing habits.</p><p>The crane shrank its neck, looking meek.</p><p>A moment later, a white light flew off the island.</p><p>Riding the crane, Qin Sang crossed the Demon Sea and returned to Great Desolation Island.</p><p>After ten years, Great Desolation Island and Tianxing Island hadn't changed much. Qin Sang contacted the major trading companies and auction houses, selling off the spirit materials he didn't need and acquiring a large quantity of Demon Slaying Pills and other treasures scarce in the Small Cold Region.</p><p>A dignified cultivator engaging in such profiteering didn't faze Qin Sang in the slightest.</p><p>However, he didn't waste too much time on this, stopping when he had enough.</p><p>Whether he could return or not was still uncertain.</p><p>While making his purchases, Qin Sang also collected treasures useful to him, preparing for the Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>After more than a month of this, he finished his business and left Tianxing Island.</p><p>He didn't know if he would ever have the chance to return.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, looking back at Tianxing Island, lost in thought.</p><p>“The Wang sisters, Two-Headed, Yuan Zhu…”</p><p>Qin Sang counted, realizing there weren't many people or things here worth remembering.</p><p>He had bid farewell to the Wang sisters and Yuan Zhu. Two-Headed's whereabouts were unknown.</p><p>He only pitied Ya Gu, who, even if she awoke, would likely never return to her homeland.</p>
