<h1>Chapter 697: The Path</h1><p>Chapter 697: The Path</p><p>After the teleportation ordeal, Qin Sang learned his lesson. He kept a small pouch at his waist, containing various items to deceive onlookers.  He didn't want a repeat of the river incident, where his Qianjun ring was snatched.</p><p>Noticing the subtle surveillance had vanished, Qin Sang sneered inwardly. He quickly returned to the stone house and cautiously set up several layers of protective formations.</p><p>Holding the bone flute, he hesitated for a long time before finally tying a rope around it, hanging it around his neck, concealed beneath his inner armor. He didn't dare let the two sections of the flute touch here.</p><p>The market was teeming with experts; it wasn't a safe place. The bone flute's peculiar power was linked to the celestial constellations.  If its power manifested, it would be difficult to conceal, attracting unwanted attention.</p><p>To be safe, Qin Sang suppressed his curiosity, deciding to wait until the trading fair ended. Over the next two days, he occasionally went out for a stroll, but found nothing of great value.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the protective barrier outside his stone house being triggered, waking him from meditation.  A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed someone from the market standing outside. Understanding the trading fair was about to begin, he opened the door.</p><p>The person, upon seeing Qin Sang, bowed. "Senior, the trading fair is about to begin. I'll escort you there now."</p><p>As Qin Sang reminisced about his recent gains, he walked towards the largest stone house in the inner area. He'd already bought most of what he needed; even without the trading fair, he'd consider himself successful.  His main reason for attending was to inquire about routes through the Thousand Demon Sea.</p><p>The Hun Yuan concentric ring wasn't strictly necessary, but without it, he wouldn't feel secure in the Demon Sea. He could avoid the ring and hunt demons elsewhere.</p><p>However, the increasingly chaotic situation outside Huntian Island indicated finding a peaceful haven in the already explored sea regions would be difficult. Unless the two factions ceased hostilities, they would inevitably be affected sooner or later.  If they didn't want to be entangled in the conflict, they would be forced into the unknown seas; then the Hun Yuan concentric ring would be indispensable.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't afford to be unprepared. Of course, if crossing the Thousand Demon Sea proved impossible, Qin Sang wouldn't force it.</p><p>Guards stood before the stone house, but upon seeing Qin Sang and his companion, they didn't stop them but instead bowed respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang entered, finding the large stone house furnished with over thirty chairs, most already occupied.</p><p>"So many Golden Core cultivators here?"  Qin Sang was secretly amazed.  He looked around, recognizing some familiar faces: managers from the most reputable trading houses.  Major trading houses had sent representatives.</p><p>He then spotted several other familiar figures, exchanging nods in the midst of scrutinizing gazes, before finding a chair in a corner and sitting down, awaiting the fair's commencement. Han Cuo wasn't present.</p><p>A couple of days earlier, Han Cuo reportedly spent all his savings on a long-desired treasure, leaving the market before the fair to bid farewell to Qin Sang. Before leaving, Han Cuo repeatedly tried to invite Qin Sang to join his group, but Qin Sang politely refused. He didn't want to get too involved with Huntian Island cultivators, promising to meet Han Cuo on the island later.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for a quarter of an hour. More people arrived, filling almost all the chairs.  Then, the elderly man seated at the far end, who had been meditating with his eyes closed, suddenly stood, drawing everyone's attention. He announced in a loud voice, "Many fellow cultivators have graced us with their presence today, including several new faces. I'm deeply honored. I'm sure you're all eager, so I won't waste time. The rules are simple:  we'll showcase treasures one by one, state the exchange conditions, and once a trade is made, it cannot be reversed. I'm not skilled, but I can serve as a witness…"</p><p>The old man spoke briefly and sat down. The attendees were clearly familiar with the procedure. They glanced at each other; a female cultivator near the entrance took out two items from her pouch and showed them to everyone. "A demon core and a damaged treasure. I'll exchange them for a type of spirit water, the exchange terms depending on the water's quality…"</p><p>The treasure was obviously severely damaged in battle, but no one seemed to mind, focusing their spiritual sense on it. Soon, some people began talking to the female cultivator. Besides the treasure, the demon core was from an early-stage Black煞 pig. For a cultivator at her level, hunting such a creature wasn't easy.</p><p>Although the Demon Sea teemed with monsters, demon cores remained highly valuable; many were tempted. Not everyone could move as swiftly as Qin Sang, easily hunting same-level beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang showed no interest in the treasure or the core and sat quietly.  The female cultivator soon found a satisfactory exchange, and it was the next person's turn.</p><p>Time slipped away, one treasure after another was brought out. Some got what they wanted, others left disappointed.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't seen anything that caught his interest until a Lei Men Crane beast egg stirred his heart.</p><p>Beast eggs were extremely valuable treasures here.  After hatching, one could personally raise and tame the beast as a spirit beast, without fear of betrayal.</p><p>However, raising a spirit beast was no easier than raising spirit insects.</p><p>Qin Sang was already raising two spirit insects; another spirit beast would require too much energy.  The Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring, on the other hand, could directly control a beast without the time investment of raising one.</p><p>The reason the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring required so many exceptionally rare materials, yet only achieved a low-grade ranking, was mostly related to this.</p><p>There was a reason why it was considered a secret treasure by the Yu Ling Sect.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring could only control beasts in the early stages of forming their inner core.  Once Qin Sang broke through to the later stages of core formation, this function would become less useful.</p><p>After a while, someone brought out a venomous fish's inner core for sale.</p><p>Qin Sang had been looking for this type of inner core to see if his Fat Silkworm could consume it, without success. Seeing it now, he immediately joined the bidding, and after some haggling, exchanged another inner core and a beast corpse for it.</p><p>Finally, it was Qin Sang's turn.</p><p>Under everyone's gaze, Qin Sang calmly brought out three inner cores and a magical artifact.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang could produce so many inner cores, the expressions of those around him changed, revealing apprehension.</p><p>"I require Soul-Guiding Grass, Wan Shi Chang..."</p><p>Qin Sang listed several herbs and pills, finally saying,  "Besides this, I also wish to inquire about a safe passage through the Thousand Demon Sea. Price negotiable."</p><p>Hearing this, those who had been eyeing Qin Sang's treasures were astonished and looked at him.</p><p>"Friend, you plan to go to the Thousand Demon Sea now?  Aren't you afraid of being ambushed by the rogue cultivators there?"</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "I didn't say I'm going now. Even if things settle down in the future, that route will likely become dangerous. But I'll have reasons to go eventually, so I'm buying a safer route now."</p>
