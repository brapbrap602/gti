<h1>Chapter 1128: Facing the Great Enemy</h1><p>Chapter 1128: Facing the Great Enemy</p><p>“After the death of the Red-Haired Ancestor, it seemed that Chunyang Sect had two Yuan Ying disciples left, but in reality, it sowed the seeds of its own destruction.  The two were always at odds. When one became Sect Master, the other couldn't accept it. They saw each other as enemies, utterly incompatible, leading to internal strife and the sect's decline.  Outsiders saw their opportunity and fanned the flames – Chongyi Daoist's hand is evident here.  Chongyi Daoist's next Heavenly Tribulation is approaching; if he fails, he will follow in the Red-Haired Ancestor's footsteps. This was meant to pave the way for Taiyi Danzong to become the dominant force, and other factions were also happy to see it happen. Unexpectedly, it actually succeeded... The new Sect Master wasn't foolish, however, and allied with the newly risen powerful sect,  Shape Mountain Sect. The result was that Chunyang Sect split in two, each side now claiming the other as rebels, and themselves as the true successors of the Red-Haired Ancestor.”</p><p>Qingjun, seemingly unconcerned with worldly affairs, was in fact acutely aware of everything.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>He thought to himself that although Chunyang Sect was now divided, it had mostly stabilized and would likely soon begin dealing with the resulting chaos.</p><p>Li Yu Fu's cave abode is not far from Da Sui; they need to keep a low profile.</p><p>“Senior Sister, do you have any plans to expand the Yuan Shen Gate?”</p><p>Qingjun, his senior sister, acted freely, often disappearing for decades and seemingly unconcerned about Yuan Shen Gate. He wondered what her true thoughts were.</p><p>“My taking over Yuan Shen Gate was a whim; I merely need them to do some odd jobs for me.”</p><p>Qingjun said indifferently.</p><p>Back at his cave abode, Qin Sang busied himself.</p><p>First, he reviewed the "Heavenly Demon Refining Form," confirming that there were no omissions and that his cultivation had reached perfection.</p><p>Then, he left Peach Blossom Valley, traveled through various market towns, and visited Tan Yi'en and Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu, in addition to the pills Qin Sang had given her, also received frequent guidance from Tan Yi’en and Li Yu Fu, and had already broken through to the eleventh level of Qi Refinement.</p><p>For a four-spirit-root cultivator, this speed was astonishing.</p><p>“These are the tokens for registered disciples of Yuan Shen Gate. If anyone comes looking for me, show them these. For the next few years, I will be avoiding a powerful enemy and will rarely appear.  When you go out to cultivate, do not mention me…”</p><p>This trip was for Qin Sang to arrange his backup plan.</p><p>He looked at Bai Hanqiu, who was no longer a girl, “Hanqiu, these pills are for you. You have about ten years to prepare for Foundation Establishment. If you fail to establish your foundation, you can choose a successor in the secular world, or leave behind the Bai family bloodline.”</p><p>Although it was harsh, Qin Sang spoke frankly.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu was not a naive girl; she could understand the realities of the situation, and his words did not shake her resolve.</p><p>“Disciple obeys!”</p><p>Bai Hanqiu's expression remained unchanged, a hint of determination flashing in her eyes.</p><p>Tan Yi'en had also broken through to the late stage of Foundation Establishment two years ago.</p><p>Qin Sang gave them both some guidance before returning to Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>Two beams of light sped across the Yun Cang Great Marsh, heading south – it was Qingjun and Qin Sang.</p><p>The outline of a large island appeared ahead.</p><p>“That’s Cang Heng Island.”</p><p>Qingjun transmitted his voice.</p><p>Qin Sang looked out, noticing a high peak in the center of Cang Heng Island, which for convenience, he named Cang Heng Peak. Atop Cang Heng Peak stood a magnificent palace, the site of the two-realm alliance meeting.</p><p>Surrounding the mountain slope, buildings were densely packed, extending all the way to the ground, truly a magnificent city.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two flew into Cang Heng Island, their speed unabated, heading straight for Cang Heng Peak.</p><p>Before reaching the city, two Nascent Soul cultivators flew out from the city. Sensing Qingjun's aura, their expressions changed slightly, and they respectfully said, “Senior, are you here for the alliance meeting?”</p><p>“Indeed. I know the rules of the city; you may retire.”</p><p>Qingjun landed on the ground, and walked into the city with Qin Sang.</p><p>The two cultivators immediately retreated without questioning Qingjun's identity.</p><p>“Flying is prohibited within the city; even Yuan Ying masters must abide by the rules. I'll go to the alliance meeting hall first; you should arrive quickly and wait for my news outside the hall.”</p><p>Although Qingjun concealed his cultivation and wore a veil, revealing only her bright eyes, her red dress was still extremely eye-catching.</p><p>Qin Sang, in his hooded cloak, walking beside her, was largely ignored.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The two separated. Qin Sang took the opportunity to visit various trading houses.</p><p>He was treated as an honored guest by the Tianxing League's trading house, reminding him of the days when they fought tooth and nail for the high-level gamble between the two realms; there might even be rivals in the city who he had fought before.</p><p>Only after reaching Nascent Soul stage could one become a chess player; otherwise, one was destined to be a mere chess piece.</p><p>This was the largest trading place between the two realms. Qin Sang quickly procured what he needed and headed towards the mountaintop.</p><p>Outside the grand assembly hall, numerous pavilions and towers of varied shapes dotted the landscape.  Few people were about, giving the place a serene atmosphere.  The area was further protected by a magical barrier, barring entry to unauthorized individuals.</p><p>Qin Sang produced his Elder's token from the Yuan Shen sect, and with a wave before the barrier, a passage opened.</p><p>One of the bamboo towers belonged to the Yuan Shen sect, where some lower-level female cultivators resided. Upon seeing an elder—even an unfamiliar one—they greeted him with great enthusiasm.</p><p>"Has the Sect Master gone to the assembly hall?" Qin Sang asked, looking towards the center of the tower.</p><p>A cultivator stepped forward and replied, "Reporting to the Elder, the Grandmaster left a short while ago.  It is said that all the other invited Grandmasters have also arrived…"</p><p>Amongst the Yuan Shen sect disciples, Qing Jun maintained the identity of Leng Yuntian.</p><p>"You may leave.  Do not disturb me without my orders," Qin Sang said coldly.</p><p>The female cultivators, somewhat disappointed, withdrew.</p><p>He sat in the quiet room, calmly awaiting news, feeling no anxiety. He hadn't expected to meet Dong Yang Bo so soon.  Since escaping Zi Wei Palace, this was his first direct encounter; he wondered what expression the man would wear.</p><p>After a stick of incense had burned, a streak of light flew into the bamboo tower.</p><p>"He's here!"</p><p>Qin Sang caught the light, removed a cloak, rose to his full height, and strode towards the assembly hall.</p><p>"Are you Elder Qin of the Yuan Shen sect?" a guard at the hall's entrance inquired.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, presented his token, and passed without hindrance.</p><p>The moment he entered the hall, Qin Sang felt an invisible pressure, his heart sinking slightly.  The assembly was comprised of the peak experts from both realms, making him acutely aware of the weight of the occasion. He bowed before them: "Elder Qin Sang of the Yuan Shen sect, greets all esteemed seniors."</p><p>Many eyes fell upon him.  Qin Sang distinctly felt one gaze like a sharp sword piercing him.</p><p>"You are Qin Sang? Come in." A familiar voice sounded—it was Zhen Yi Laodao.</p><p>Without changing his expression, Qin Sang went to stand behind his senior sister, Qing Jun.  His gaze swept across the assembled figures.  Some were familiar faces, including the two at the head table: Zhen Yi Laodao and Tong You Mo Jun. There was also Chong Yi Daozhang, the head of the Tai Yi Dan sect, and the She Po of the Yu Ling sect.  However, She Po had now reached the Nascent Soul stage. Beside her stood a strange half-human, half-serpent creature, her spirit beast, at the peak of the Core Formation stage—the only demon cultivator present.</p><p>Most importantly, seated beside Tong You Mo Jun was a man in brocade robes.</p><p>Dong Yang Bo!</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, Dong Yang Bo showed no anger, but instead smiled and nodded at him.</p>
