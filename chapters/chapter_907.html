<h1>Chapter 899: The Stone Platform</h1><p>“Martial Uncle Wu spearheaded that incident. He forcibly cultivated the technique, causing demonic energy to overwhelm his mind, drastically altering his personality. He nearly caused irreparable damage to our sect, a chaos that still affects us today. Your adoptive father showed immense mercy by allowing Martial Uncle Wu to leave with you without holding him accountable…”</p><p>Elder Lu disagreed with the strong man's words.</p><p>The strong man abruptly waved his hand, interrupting Elder Lu and scoffing, “Master has long passed away. Of course, you can say whatever you like! I, Gao, am not here to argue about right and wrong. After leaving the Luminous Cauldrons Sect, my fellow disciples and I endured countless torments. Following Master's final instructions, we finally discovered a method that may alleviate our suffering. But we need that stone platform. Junior Brother Lu, in the name of our former brotherhood, hand it over, and let bygones be bygones!”</p><p>Elder Lu was taken aback but firmly refused, “This object is of great importance and cannot leave Illumination Island. As for solving the hidden dangers of the Lightning Manipulation Technique, that's absurd. It was merely discovered alongside the technique and has some auxiliary functions. Martial Uncle Wu and Master have already studied it countless times. Do you think I’m ignorant of this secret technique, Senior Brother Gao?”</p><p>The strong man snorted, “If you don’t believe me, let me try it in the Thunder Caves, and won’t it be clear then?”</p><p>Elder Lu frowned slightly, suspicion rising in his heart.</p><p>Judging by his expression, could they have truly grasped something?</p><p>But the two Nascent Soul ancestors had studied it together for years without any results.</p><p>At this moment, Elder Huayang, who had been observing the three, flashed a look of doubt but remained uncertain. After a moment's thought, he transmitted his voice to Elder Lu.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu, since that's the case, let them reveal the method first. We can verify its authenticity before discussing further.”</p><p>Elder Lu nodded slightly and said aloud, “If it can solve the hidden dangers of the Lightning Manipulation Technique, it would benefit us all. Senior Brother Gao, please show me the method first. If it's effective, I’m not an unreasonable person.”</p><p>Hearing these words,</p><p>the young man surnamed Fang, standing at the back, raised his head, his eyes flickering.</p><p>The strong man feigned contemplation, then retrieved a jade slip and handed it to Elder Lu, “Then please take a look, Junior Brother Lu!”</p><p>As he spoke, a bloody glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Elder Huayang’s expression changed drastically, and he shouted, “He’s not Senior Brother Gao! It's a trap!”</p><p>Simultaneously, he flicked his duster, transforming it into countless fine threads that shot straight towards the strong man.</p><p>But he was a step too late. A strange smile appeared on the strong man's face, his expression suddenly stiffening as an inhuman sound escaped his throat.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The strong man’s body suddenly exploded.</p><p>A cloud of blood mist erupted, filling the entire bamboo pavilion. No trace of the strong man remained. The blood mist, formed from his essence blood, pulsed like a living thing. With a sudden expansion and contraction, a slender blood-colored serpent emerged. It opened its maw wide and, with a shrill cry, lunged at Elder Lu, who was closest.</p><p>Elder Lu was, after all, a peak-stage Late Core Formation cultivator. Coupled with Elder Huayang’s timely warning, he remained composed despite the sudden change.</p><p>He waved his hand, and his true essence surged like a tide, forming a barrier of light. But the blood mist crashed against it, shattering the barrier instantly. The blood serpent was already upon him.</p><p>Elder Lu’s expression shifted. A blue light flickered from his dantian, and a dragon-eye-sized orb shot out, his nascent soul treasure.</p><p>With a thought, he activated the treasure. Immense water-elemental power slammed into the blood serpent like a giant wave.</p><p>At the same time, Elder Huayang’s duster also arrived, its white threads piercing the blood serpent like silver needles.</p><p>The immediate danger seemed to be averted.</p><p>However, the other cultivators didn’t possess Elder Lu’s strength.</p><p>As the strong man's body was detonated by the Blood Corpse Worm, the cultivator surnamed Hong also exploded, his essence blood devoured by the worm, transforming it into another blood serpent.</p><p>The Blood Corpse Worm was already a third-transformation spirit insect. After devouring the essence blood of a Core Formation cultivator, its power would surge to the limit of its control for a period, until the absorbed energy was depleted.  This made it incredibly dangerous.</p><p>Otherwise, the young man surnamed Fang wouldn’t have dared to venture into this dangerous situation with two corpse puppets, facing so many powerful enemies.</p><p>Under Fang’s deliberate arrangement, the cultivator surnamed Hong had been standing close to two early-stage Core Formation cultivators from the Luminous Cauldrons Sect.</p><p>Those two never imagined that their former fellow disciple would attack them, and they were completely unprepared.</p><p>With the corpse puppet's explosion,</p><p>they were engulfed by the blood mist before they could react.</p><p>Two screams echoed from within the mist, followed by a figure stumbling out, utterly disheveled. The skin on his face had been corroded by the blood mist, leaving him unrecognizable.</p><p>Fortunately, he was a Core Formation cultivator and managed to activate his spiritual power and protective treasure in time, narrowly escaping death.</p><p>However, the other scream quickly faded.</p><p>Another explosion sounded from within the blood mist, and the mist grew denser, forming a larger, more ferocious blood serpent that lunged at the escaping cultivator.</p><p>The man's face was filled with terror as he turned to flee.</p><p>But from the corner of his eye, he saw a blood-red sword pierce his heart with terrifying speed. He died instantly, his body enveloped by the blood mist, his essence blood also consumed by the Blood Corpse Worm.</p><p>Meanwhile, the young man surnamed Fang joined forces with the other blood serpent.</p><p>He had revealed his true cultivation, which, while not as high as Elder Lu's, wasn't far behind. Clad in a strange insect armor, he and the blood serpent forced Elder Lu to retreat continuously.  He also fought one against three, holding back Elder Huayang and the other cultivator.</p><p>This allowed him to watch as the two disciples of the Luminous Cauldrons Sect were killed by the Blood Corpse Worm.</p><p>Of course, this was due to Fang’s meticulous planning and Elder Lu's being caught off guard.</p><p>This suppression wouldn't last, but the Blood Corpse Worm, its power surging after devouring the essence blood of three Core Formation cultivators, now joined the fray.</p><p>While relentlessly attacking the Luminous Cauldrons Sect cultivators, Fang silently chanted an incantation. The blood mist within the bamboo pavilion solidified, and the blood serpents merged into it, forming a seemingly impenetrable barrier that trapped Elder Lu and the others inside.</p><p>Fang’s plan had been long in the making, and his attack was swift and decisive.</p><p>The other cultivators on the bamboo platforms outside, having discussed the Luminous Cauldrons Sect without reaching any conclusions, began to disperse, some leaving to check on their disciples, but most remained.</p><p>When they heard the commotion, before they could understand what was happening, the bamboo pavilion had transformed into a sea of blood, the pungent metallic scent sickeningly sweet.</p><p>Then, a shout, the source unknown, echoed, “Lu, you dare defy even the ancestor’s orders? Do you intend to betray the sect?!”</p><p>This accusation stopped everyone who was about to rush to the pavilion's aid in their tracks, leaving them stunned and bewildered.</p><p>The Luminous Cauldrons Sect had only two ancestors.</p><p>Sect Leader Lu was trapped in the Demonic Sea and unable to return.</p><p>The one remaining in the sect was Ancestor Wu.</p><p>Could it be that their earlier suspicions were true?</p>
