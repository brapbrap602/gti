<h1>Chapter 318: Daring to Ask Heaven, How to Become Immortal</h1><p>Sealing the sand cave, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>His initial strategy was to feign weakness, allowing his opponent to lower their guard.  Then, during their pursuit, he intentionally returned, utilizing the concealed talisman and the Yin-Yang compass to swiftly close the distance and eliminate the strongest one in a surprise attack.</p><p>This maneuver appeared incredibly risky.</p><p>In reality, the worst-case scenario was Scarface being prepared and blocking his sudden assault.</p><p>With the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, Qin Sang could still escape at any moment and wouldn't be trapped in a hopeless situation.</p><p>He managed to eliminate a powerful enemy and capture two others without resorting to his talisman treasure or the Ten Yama Banners. Reviewing the battle, Qin Sang was quite pleased with his performance.</p><p>After a brief rest to recover, Qin Sang conjured a ball of icy water with a flick of his finger and splashed it on Yu Daiyue's face.</p><p>Yu Daiyue awoke from his unconscious state. Following a moment of disorientation, his gaze met Qin Sang's with an unsettling calmness.  He didn't plead for mercy, remaining silent.</p><p>Qin Sang could see Yu Daiyue's desire for death.</p><p>Yu Daiyue had to die, but Qin Sang was curious why Yu Daiyue wanted to kill him.</p><p>He pointed his fingers repeatedly, sending out soundwave-like restraints that drifted toward Yu Daiyue.  Landing on him, the restraints caused Yu Daiyue to furrow his brow. With his spiritual power depleted and his energy center sealed, he was powerless to resist, left at Qin Sang's mercy.</p><p>Restraint after restraint was applied, yet Yu Daiyue felt no change, growing impatient.</p><p>"Kill me!"</p><p>Yu Daiyue finally spoke, urging Qin Sang to end his life, his voice raspy.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him, his fingers moving faster.</p><p>Finally, the last restraint of the Soul Seizure Curse was formed. Qin Sang's fingers moved like lightning, swiftly striking Yu Daiyue's forehead. The restraint flashed, sinking into him.</p><p>Yu Daiyue's body trembled, a struggle evident in his eyes, which then became vacant, staring straight ahead.</p><p>The Soul Seizure Curse took effect.</p><p>Qin Sang had obtained this curse from Old Man Di Que's belongings.  This was his first time using it since mastering it. He could see Yu Daiyue's resolve to die, knowing that questioning him would be futile. He decided to test the curse's effectiveness.</p><p>"Brother Yu, do I have a grudge against you?"</p><p>Qin Sang cut to the chase, voicing his biggest question.</p><p>"No grudge."</p><p>Yu Daiyue shook his head, his tone flat, his response swift.</p><p>"Why," Qin Sang crouched down, "why kill me?"</p><p>"Because you are trash!"</p><p>Yu Daiyue's expression suddenly became ferocious, his eyes bloodshot as he glared at Qin Sang.  Veins bulged in his neck as he let out a hysterical roar.</p><p>"Trash!</p><p>Five-element spiritual root trash!</p><p>Used, damaged trash!</p><p>Dregs!</p><p>Why!</p><p>Why did you breakthrough before me!</p><p>Do you know what I've been through all these years?</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Because of you, I couldn't even be a cauldron!</p><p>Because of Li Zai, I was punished by that old fool Feng Ming, almost expelled!</p><p>I had nowhere to go, so for my breakthrough, I risked my life in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield for twenty years!</p><p>Twenty years, countless times I entered the most dangerous secret realms, walking on the edge of life and death!</p><p>I tried dozens, hundreds, thousands of times!</p><p>Every time, I failed!</p><p>All my efforts, all useless!</p><p>That damned bottleneck, still towering above me!</p><p>It's mocking me!</p><p>That damned Heaven is mocking me too!</p><p>Everyone is mocking me!</p><p>And you?</p><p>If it weren't for selling yourself, you wouldn't have been able to establish your foundation!</p><p>While I was fighting outside, you hid in the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm for twenty years, and your power surpassed mine!</p><p>And now, you've broken through again!</p><p>Why you?</p><p>Why... not me?</p><p>Why... why... why..."</p><p>Venting his anger at the injustice of heaven, Yu Daiyue's voice weakened, but he persisted, his hoarse voice repeatedly questioning with those three wordsâ€”why.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly met the crazed Yu Daiyue's gaze.</p><p>Surprisingly, being called trash to his face didn't anger him.  Even the resentment from the ambush vanished, replaced by an overwhelming sorrow.</p><p>"So, back in the Ancient Cultivator's ruins, you had already decided to kill me.  Five years ago, inviting me back to the ruins to harvest the Earthfire Pantung was also a trap."</p><p>Qin Sang waited for Yu Daiyue to finish venting, then sneered, "Why make yourself sound so wronged? Because my talent was inferior to yours, you assumed my breakthrough was due to some fortunate encounter and wanted to steal it, right?  What did you mean earlier about handing over the treasure I obtained from the Heavenly Corpse Cave?"</p><p>"Without a fortunate encounter, how could you surpass me? How could you break through before me?"</p><p>Yu Daiyue's tone was confident, certain, "In the Heavenly Corpse Cave, you must have obtained a treasure from the Heavenly Corpse Sect in the core forbidden area, otherwise you couldn't have cultivated so quickly!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, rebuking, "Nonsense! The core forbidden area of the Heavenly Corpse Cave was in ruins.  I went in with you, we searched together, there's no way I could have hidden anything... Wait..."</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered that before entering the core forbidden area, he pushed open the heavy iron gate first, and only then did Yu Daiyue appear.</p><p>When Yu Daiyue arrived, he must have seen the gate already open, with Qin Sang standing in front of it!</p><p>Qin Sang realized the truth.</p><p>Although he hadn't actually gone in first, anyone seeing that scene would likely be suspicious, wouldn't they?</p><p>No wonder...</p><p>Trapped at the bottleneck, Yu Daiyue had become obsessed.</p><p>Every time Yu Daiyue recalled that scene, coupled with the fact that Qin Sang had surpassed him, it must have been like a thorn, deeply embedded in his heart.</p><p>Deeper and deeper, more and more painful, until it drove him mad.</p><p>Qin Sang was silent for a moment, then suddenly asked, "Did you have any thoughts of killing me for the treasure back then?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Yu Daiyue shook his head.</p><p>Soon, a flicker appeared in Yu Daiyue's eyes. The Soul Seizure Curse wore off; the curse couldn't erase his memories. He remembered everything that had just transpired.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't wait for Yu Daiyue to speak, sighing softly, and finally called him Brother Yu one last time.</p><p>"I'll give you a quick death."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang pressed his palm onto Yu Daiyue's forehead, his spiritual power surging forth, shattering Yu Daiyue's soul. Then, a burst of flames engulfed Yu Daiyue, reducing him to ashes.</p><p>Let it be said that Yu Daiyue disappeared in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, just like countless fellow cultivators who struggled on the path to immortality, silently perishing for various reasons.</p><p>With this, the last trace of Yu Daiyue vanished from the world.</p><p>Qin Sang had taken more than one life, and now he felt no ripple of emotion when killing.</p><p>However, after eliminating an enemy who had ambushed him, Qin Sang felt no sense of relief, only a heavy feeling in his chest.</p><p>He looked up. The thick layer of sand blocked his view, obscuring the clear blue sky, but it couldn't contain his thoughts.</p><p>Daring to ask Heaven, how to become immortal?</p>
