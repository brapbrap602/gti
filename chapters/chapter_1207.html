<h1>Chapter 1199: The Stone House</h1><p>Chapter 1199: The Stone House</p><p>This stone wall appears unremarkable at first glance.</p><p>Had it not been for Tianmu Butterfly's warning, Qin Sang might have overlooked it completely.  Even cultivators from the Nan Yin Mountains would be unlikely to discover its secret.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tianmu Butterfly examined the wall closely for a long time, finally confirming that the strange array etched upon it possessed a distinct divine inscription aura, unmistakably of Wu origin!</p><p>In the Cang Lang Sea, this wouldn't have been surprising. Before the Seven Killing Hall's emergence and the rise of the four Human Saints, who drove the Wu people to the Wu God Continent, the Wu were the masters of the Cang Lang Sea.</p><p>But in Xiao Han Domain, Qin Sang had never encountered any trace of the Wu, either through personal experience or hearsay.</p><p>There weren't even any similar legends throughout the entire Bei Chen Realm.</p><p>A Wu array hidden deep within the Tian Hen region!</p><p>Could this be connected to the Tian Shi Sect?</p><p>Could the Tian Shi talismans be a Wu secret technique, and the key to unlocking them lie with the Wu?</p><p>That would be a frustrating case of missing a golden opportunity!</p><p>In the Cang Lang Sea, Qin Sang had witnessed the Wu’s necromantic arts, similar to those practiced by humans but vastly different from those of the Tian Shi Sect.</p><p>Unless the Cang Lang Sea Wu's necromantic lineage had been severed and its remnants had drifted here.</p><p>Regardless, encountering a Wu array demanded investigation.</p><p>Qin Sang proceeded cautiously, working with Tianmu Butterfly to use their combined Tianmu divine ability to carefully examine the array, searching for a way to break it.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang began to understand.</p><p>“The array itself isn't particularly powerful, but whoever set it was incredibly clever and intricate, layering it in several stages. The outer layer isn't just for concealment; it’s imbued with destructive energy, designed to self-destruct if forced. The inner layers seem to have illusionary, defensive, and even displacement properties, allowing someone inside to escape…”</p><p>After careful analysis, Qin Sang looked at the stone wall with a doubtful expression.</p><p>“It feels like it's meant to protect a hidden abode? The power isn't as terrifying as other ancient arrays I've encountered. Could it be that a cultivator obtained a Wu legacy and established a dwelling here?”</p><p>Qin Sang's knowledge of the Wu was limited, so he couldn't confirm his guess, but his intuition felt off.</p><p>After considering this, instead of acting rashly, he retreated from the area, setting up precautions as usual before attempting to interact with the array.</p><p>It was akin to sending a message expressing his intent to visit.</p><p>After waiting a long time and several unsuccessful attempts, he decided to stop waiting.</p><p>The Tianmu's large eyes, more than just markings, opened on the butterfly's wings.  They were deep and profound, the pupils filled with chaos, and the gaze of the Tianmu Butterfly seemed tangible, carrying faint threads of lightning energy.</p><p>The Tianmu gazed at the stone wall.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his twelve Demon Banners planted nearby, sat cross-legged before the wall, carefully using his Jin Chen Sword to unravel the array, his movements incredibly subtle and cautious.</p><p>This method was slow, but it prevented any backlash during the process.</p><p>His ability to do this stemmed from his high cultivation, his familiarity with Wu divine inscriptions having seen their cultivation methods, and most importantly, Tianmu Butterfly.</p><p>Layer by layer, the array was broken, revealing the stone wall's true nature.</p><p>As expected, it led to a hidden realm.</p><p>Even after the array was completely broken, there was no reaction from within.</p><p>After waiting a moment to ensure no anomalies existed, Qin Sang left Fatty Chicken outside, summoned his twelve Demon Banners, and stepped inside.  He felt a spatial shift, and the next moment, found himself on a mountaintop.</p><p>“How desolate!”</p><p>That was his first impression of the hidden realm.</p><p>There were no plants, trees, pavilions, or buildings, only a monotonous gray ground stretching to the horizon.</p><p>Though it seemed empty at first glance, closer inspection revealed a layer of fine dust covering the ground, as if repeatedly ravaged by storms, with everything ground to pieces – "ruins" was an understatement.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the energy fluctuations a century ago.  Could this place have been ravaged by that event?</p><p>Or perhaps, this was the epicenter!</p><p>Qin Sang flew towards the deeper parts of the hidden realm.</p><p>The desolate landscape continued uninterrupted, but after flying a distance and nearing the boundary, he finally saw something different—a stone house!</p><p>The stone house was built in a pit, surrounded by raised ground, but just as dilapidated as everything else.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, sweeping out his spiritual sense.</p><p>The area around the stone house was silent, devoid of any other presence.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then slipped into the stone house, easily bypassing the magical seal on the door.  He pushed it open and, seeing the interior, paused slightly.</p><p>The stone house was small, its contents immediately apparent.  The left room held meditation cushions and a jade altar. The right side was mostly empty, except for a large, still-active ice spirit array.  However, the spirit stones within were pale, their energy depleted, and the array was barely functioning, drawing on ambient spiritual energy to survive. The owner had clearly been gone for a long time.</p><p>A chill emanated from the ice spirit array. At its center, the cold had formed a low, knee-high, rectangular ice platform.  It was empty.</p><p>Seeing the platform, Qin Sang immediately recalled something: the crystal coffin he'd given Tan Hao to hold Tan Jie's body.  The dimensions were nearly identical. This seemed purpose-built as a resting place for the coffin.</p><p>"Could the house's owner be Tan Hao?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. The ice platform and spirit array looked like they were designed to work with the coffin, protecting Tan Jie's remains.  This was unexpected. He'd considered many possibilities, none of which involved Tan Hao. When had Tan Hao learned the Wu tribe's magical runes, and to such a high degree?  Even the Wu practitioners of the Canglang Sea couldn't create such sophisticated runes.</p><p>"Judging by the arrangement, Tan Hao lived here for a long time before leaving for unknown reasons..."</p><p>Qin Sang deduced.</p><p>But Qin Sang wondered: were the outer Wu tribe seals already there, with Tan Hao, like himself, breaking them to enter? Or had Tan Hao placed them himself? What had he found here?  Why had he stayed?</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang approached the cushions. Aside from the ice spirit array and some odds and ends, the house contained little else.  It didn't look like Tan Hao had been driven out by enemies, fleeing in haste, nor had he left any useful clues.</p><p>"After leaving here, where did Tan Hao go? Why arrange for the ice spirit array and the coffin? Did he not find the Tian Shi Sect's legacy, or did the sect lack a way to break the Tian Shi Seal? If so, why didn't he return to Xiaohan Domain to see Tan Yi'en? Or did something else happen later?"</p><p>Many questions filled Qin Sang's mind.  These discoveries cast a shadow over his heart. If even the Tian Shi Sect couldn't break the Tian Shi Seal, his only hope of awakening Ya Gu rested on Bai.</p>
