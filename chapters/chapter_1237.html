<h1>Chapter 1229: Rest in Peace</h1><p>Stone Song Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang received the message and rushed over without delay.</p><p>"I'm not sure what the ancient cultivators used to carry the spirit array, but I've forged a few array artifacts and a formation diagram, barely managing to restore a portion of it..."</p><p>Qing Jun walked out, holding several items, which she handed to Qin Sang.</p><p>Among them was a formation diagram made from an unknown type of animal hide.</p><p>The formation diagram, when not activated, was only the size of a palm. It was inscribed with cinnabar lines, identical to the patterns Qin Sang had once copied.</p><p>Within the patterns, a strange power flowed, its fluctuations resonating with the Demon-Binding Rope in Qing Jun's hand.</p><p>The other array artifacts were also designed to work in conjunction with the formation diagram, maximizing the power of the Demon-Binding Rope.</p><p>"You mentioned before that I should consult your friend who practices the Corpse Dao. I went back to the Mist Illusion Sect specifically to meet him, and he gave me quite a few suggestions—many of which I hadn't considered... Do you know his origins?"</p><p>Qing Jun recalled something and asked with curiosity.</p><p>Before handing the Demon-Binding Rope to Qing Jun, Qin Sang had planned to wait for Bai to break through and then ask him to restore the rope. He had mentioned to Qing Jun that if the two of them worked together, the chances of success would be greater.</p><p>Qing Jun had returned at some point, but Bai hadn't mentioned it during their last meeting.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. Bai and Qing Jun had no prior connection, and even with Qin Sang as a mediator, they couldn't trust each other.</p><p>When Bai had come out of Peach Blossom Valley to meet Qing Jun, he had used a disguised identity.</p><p>Qing Jun didn't know Bai's true origins.</p><p>Since Bai himself didn't wish to reveal his secrets, Qin Sang couldn't disclose them either. He replied vaguely, "Given the nature of these ancient secrets, Brother Bai wouldn't speak without reason."</p><p>Qing Jun nodded thoughtfully and didn't press further.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the formation diagram but couldn't discern its quality. He stepped out of the room and took out a demonic banner. "Let's test it..."</p><p>A stream of demonic fire flew out from the banner.</p><p>Understanding his intent, Qing Jun tossed the Demon-Binding Rope into the air and formed a hand seal with her jade-like fingers. The formation diagram flew out of Qin Sang's palm, instantly expanding to the size of an acre. The array artifacts merged into the diagram.</p><p>The formation diagram spun rapidly, positioning itself beneath the Demon-Binding Rope. The previously rigid rope came to life, twisting and writhing, its chains clattering.</p><p>Smoke began to rise within the courtyard.</p><p>The formation diagram itself vanished, transforming into a misty terrain.</p><p>Qing Jun's hand seals changed again.</p><p>Suddenly, dozens of illusory copies of the Demon-Binding Rope emerged from the mist, like black serpents, lunging toward the demonic fire.</p><p>*Snap! Snap!*</p><p>*Clatter!*</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the demonic fire was tightly bound by the ropes, shrinking into a ball.</p><p>Qing Jun waved her hand, retrieving the Demon-Binding Rope and the formation diagram. After a moment of contemplation, she said, "The Demon-Binding Rope does indeed have the ability to suppress demonic fire, but this can't be its full power. We'll need to continue refining it. Additionally, setting up the formation diagram and activating the rope takes time—enough for an enemy to react, escape, or disrupt it. Unless it's prepared in advance, it's difficult to use in combat. This also needs improvement."</p><p>Seeing that Qing Jun had already pointed out the flaws, Qin Sang didn't need to add anything. Instead, he shared some of his own thoughts.</p><p>He had some insights into artifact forging and had browsed the Mist Illusion Sect's treasured collections, which might inspire his senior sister.</p><p>The two of them discussed for a long time, not only about the Demon-Binding Rope but also about their upcoming journey to the Blood Lake.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang returned to Threefold Pass.</p><p>In the following days, Qin Sang rarely left Threefold Pass, dedicating himself to cultivation day and night. He temporarily halted his body refinement training, using that time instead to refine the demonic fire and nurture the Fire Lotus Seed.</p><p>The *Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture* was never interrupted.</p><p>No matter how powerful these secret techniques were, they were only superficial. True strength came from advancing one's cultivation realm.</p><p>A year passed uneventfully.</p><p>News from the Boundless Valley continued to arrive. The Blood Lake's seal was still trembling, but there were no signs of it loosening yet.</p><p>The war had entered a prolonged stalemate. Qin Sang couldn't help but admire the patience of the Sin Abyss cultivators. Despite achieving little, they stubbornly remained on the Heavenly March Plateau, occasionally launching harassing attacks, treating the battlefield as a training ground.</p><p>He wondered if their goal was to tie down the cultivators of the two regions here.</p><p>Unable to decipher the Sin Abyss's intentions, Qin Sang decided not to waste his energy on it.</p><p>His purpose in entering the Blood Lake was twofold: first, to search for the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon and to see if any fragments of the Blood Mulberry Tree were scattered in the lake; second, to thwart Elder Ye's schemes.</p><p>If things became too dangerous, Qin Sang certainly wouldn't risk his life.</p><p>With the Eighteen Demon Banners protecting him, even Elder Ye wouldn't be able to stop him if he decided to leave. Old Monkey and the others had already found a cave dwelling overseas. At worst, he could relocate his juniors and establish himself as a ruler on an island.</p><p>However, doing so would make it much more difficult to enter the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Thus, unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang had no intention of leaving the Frost Domain.</p><p>Several more months passed, and the cultivators stationed at the Boundless Valley finally sent back definitive news: the Blood Lake's seal was loosening and would soon be broken.</p><p>After discussing with Tongyou Demon Lord and others, they decided to act, fearing that Elder Ye might have some method to slip in unnoticed before the seal was fully broken.</p><p>Upon receiving a message from his senior sister, Qin Sang didn't join them at the Ice Crystal Palace. Instead, he called upon Fat Chicken and headed straight into the Boundless Valley. For this purpose, Qin Sang had refined the Primordial Unity Ring with several precious spiritual materials, allowing it to carry Fat Chicken.</p><p>The blood miasma at the outskirts of the Boundless Valley no longer posed a threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>Time was plentiful.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that the blood miasma was home to a strange insect, the Ghost-Headed Wasp. He spent some time searching the miasma for it.</p><p>Much of Qin Sang's current strength was owed to the Fat Silkworm, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, and the Fire Jade Centipede—three spirit insects that had greatly aided him. Thus, he paid special attention to the spirit insects listed on the Rare Insect Ranking.</p><p>Unfortunately, not even the Blood-Winged Ghost-Headed Wasp could be found, let alone the native Ghost-Headed Wasp.</p><p>Finding nothing, Qin Sang didn't linger and flew straight into the inner valley of the Boundless Valley.</p><p>This time, he took the same route he had traveled with Wanderer Yun.</p><p>As he passed through the inner valley's barrier, Qin Sang recalled how he and Wanderer Yun had discovered traces of the Wuji Sect's leader here, which had led to the subsequent events.</p><p>Memories flooded his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang moved forward, stopping occasionally, and soon found the icy plain.</p><p>The ice fissure was still there. Qin Sang descended beneath the ice layer and swiftly traversed the area. Before long, an ice palace came into view.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang appeared in the ice palace, a dark figure lunged at him.</p><p>The stench of corpse energy filled the air.</p><p>The attacker had a green face and fangs, a ferocious Flying Yaksha—it was Wu Shang.</p><p>In his pursuit of the Dao, Wu Shang had turned himself into a living corpse. He had come here in search of the Night Lily but had succumbed to corpse poison. For countless years, he had wandered here, lost and unable to find peace.</p><p>Without Qin Sang making any visible movements, Wu Shang was immobilized, unable to move.</p><p>"May you rest in peace, Senior, and return to the cycle of reincarnation."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed deeply, performing a solemn ritual to express his gratitude for Wu Shang's guidance on the path of cultivation.</p><p>With a solemn expression, Qin Sang extended his finger and gently touched Wu Shang's forehead.</p><p>Wu Shang's aura rapidly faded.</p><p>In his final moment, a glimmer of serenity seemed to flicker in those lifeless eyes...</p><p>---</p><p>Apologies for the delay—there's been a lot going on. This is today's chapter; I'll make up for it later.</p>
