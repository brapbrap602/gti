<h1>Chapter 2121 A Close Brush with Death</h1><p>Qin Sang's holding back last time was within their expectations. After all, their defeat was too swift, too ignominious.</p><p>The continuous dispatch of scouting parties into the formation was meant to force out more of its variations, thereby deducing a method to break it.</p><p>To counter Qin Sang, Shi Mu and Shi Ying were willing to use a trump card, but they hadn't expected it to be so easily countered.</p><p>While Qin Sang's formidable strength was a factor, their own state also played a part.  They had each left a companion beast within the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram. They weren't at their peak strength, not because they didn't trust the Diagram, but because they trusted themselves more.</p><p>Furthermore, they needed to guard against Qin Sang having other helpers launching a surprise attack.</p><p>Even so, the fact that Qin Sang neutralized their offensive with only his movement technique was far beyond their expectations, shaking them to their core and preventing them from noticing the changes on the other battlefield in time.</p><p>High above, lightning surged like an ocean, with figures of Thunder Gods flickering in and out of existence.</p><p>All the Thunder Gods pointed their weapons skyward, striking at the clouds. Thick pillars of lightning seemed to connect to the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Countless bolts of lightning danced between the Thunder Gods, transforming into dazzling chains of thunder held in their hands, forming a boundless net of lightning that enveloped the entire battlefield.</p><p>The Thunder Gods glared, their thunderous chains swirling in unison!</p><p>In an instant, terrifying lightning energy permeated the air.</p><p>The Void Realm Second Stage cultivator employed a rather conservative strategy, advancing cautiously. Several fierce attacks by the Thunder Gods were repelled without success.  At this moment, the Twelve Thunder God Talismans suddenly unleashed their divine might.  However, he didn't panic. With a single command, bursts of black light erupted from within the battle formation.</p><p>The black light was as dark as ink, like a black tide swallowing everything.</p><p>The chains of thunder pierced through the void with boundless power.  Despite reacting in time, the cultivator still felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>'Boom!' The first chain of thunder lashed out at the formation, striking a patch of black light.</p><p>The cultivators there were concealed by the black light. A flash of lightning later, both the black light and the cultivators beneath vanished without a trace.</p><p>Lightning filled the sky, crisscrossing downwards.</p><p>The chains of thunder deliberately avoided the Void Realm Second Stage cultivator, targeting Lu Wang's subordinates.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the cultivator watched helplessly as swathes of the formation were emptied. Just as he was about to intervene, Shi Mu and Shi Ying's voices came from outside, "Retreat!"</p><p>Shi Mu took one last look at Qin Sang before decisively choosing to retreat.</p><p>Having witnessed the power of Qin Sang's movement technique and forced out the second transformation of the Thunder Gods, they hadn't returned empty-handed.</p><p>Lu Gan employed his old trick, activating the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram to help Shi Mu and the others retreat smoothly.  Calm returned to the battlefield.</p><p>Following this, they analyzed their encounter. A few days later, they dispatched another small team, still led by three early Void Realm Second Stage cultivators, but with more subordinates.</p><p>The tranquility within the Thunder Marsh was shattered once more.</p><p>This time, the process was similar to before. As soon as the invading side showed signs of defeat, they contacted Lu Gan and chose to retreat, repeating the previous process.</p><p>From then on, every few days, sometimes every ten or so days, Lu Wang would send people to probe the formation.</p><p>As their understanding of Qin Sang and the Twelve Thunder God Talismans deepened, the strength of the probing forces increased. They gradually developed a method to cope, and the situation slowly began to reverse.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this and wasn't anxious, consistently leading the one hundred and twenty Thunder Gods alone against the enemy.</p><p>Another retreat.</p><p>Within Lu Wang's carriage, numerous cultivators gathered.</p><p>Lu Wang looked around and said, "Over these past days, everyone has worked tirelessly, constantly probing.  The Grand Protector and I have gained some insights into how to break the formation.  However, there is one thing. Since the beginning of the conflict, only that True Person Qin has acted. What are your thoughts on this?"</p><p>The cultivators fell into contemplation.</p><p>After so many battles, let alone Xia Changshi, even Si Lu and the mysterious cultivator who had appeared in the North Sea hadn't shown themselves. As for whether there were other hidden cultivators, they were even less certain.  Perhaps they were lurking somewhere, ready to deliver a fatal blow at any moment.</p><p>This was also why they didn't dare to launch a rash attack despite their superior strength.</p><p>After a brief silence, a silver-armored cultivator stepped forward and said, "I have a plan. Since that True Person Qin is being so secretive, why don't we launch a full-scale assault, with the Grand Protector waiting for an opportunity to strike?  If that True Person Qin is overwhelmed, he will definitely call for reinforcements. If they still refuse to reveal themselves, we will seize the opportunity to break that Thunder God Formation and gain the upper hand!"</p><p>"Mountain Lord Mo speaks wisely," the Grand Protector looked towards Lu Wang.</p><p>Lu Wang agreed, "Let's proceed according to this plan!"</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Silhouettes appeared at the edge of the land.  A total of seven early Void Realm Second Stage cultivators, led by Shi Mu and Shi Ying, were about to lead their army into the formation once again.</p><p>"We request the Grand Protector to cover us."</p><p>Shi Mu bowed his hands towards the Grand Protector, who had come to see them off.</p><p>The Grand Protector nodded, transmitting his voice, "Once this formation is broken, I will keep my promise and give that item to the two of you."</p><p>Hearing this, a spark of excitement flashed in Shi Mu's eyes.</p><p>To break this formation, he and Shi Ying had painstakingly gone through repeated clashes with Qin Sang, and this time they were even using themselves as bait to force Xia Changshi out, all for this promise!</p><p>"We will certainly live up to your expectations!"</p><p>Shi Mu roared, and the vast army marched towards the Thunder Marsh.</p><p>Inside the Thunder Marsh, a chilling atmosphere prevailed. Qin Sang's expression was grave as he felt the pressure.  He gazed into the distance for a moment before withdrawing his gaze and disappearing.</p><p>The scenery within the Thunder Marsh was monotonous. The cultivators advanced at a steady pace, reaching the edge of the Thunder God Formation. Previously, they would have been attacked upon reaching this point, but now it was unusually quiet.</p><p>After a brief discussion, Shi Mu and the others ordered the advance to continue.</p><p>Sure enough, they hadn't flown far before a torrential downpour of thunder descended from the sky.</p><p>"Form the Sky Mirror Formation!"</p><p>Including the Void Realm Second Stage cultivators, everyone immediately followed Shi Mu's command without hesitation.</p><p>The battle formation transformed, taking the shape of a Bagua. Above the formation, silver light shimmered.  It turned out to be numerous silver mirrors, reflecting the lightning and creating an illusion.</p><p>These mirrors not only reflected light, but when lightning struck their surface, it was like hitting water. Ripples spread, and most of the lightning's power was dissipated.</p><p>Before the first wave subsided, the second wave of attacks followed closely.</p><p>Chains of thunder struck repeatedly. Within the formation, mirrors rose, and red ribbons shot out.</p><p>These red ribbons were extremely soft and flexible, deftly latching onto the chains of thunder and instantly wrapping around them.</p><p>The immensely powerful chains of thunder, once entangled by the red ribbons, lost much of their momentum. Despite their surging power, they could only shake off a small portion of the ribbons, unable to destroy them.</p><p>The second wave of attacks was easily neutralized.</p><p>Shi Mu ordered a rapid advance. The formation, topped with silver mirrors and trailing red ribbons, spun forward.</p><p>The third wave of attacks arrived swiftly. Countless rings of thunder erupted from the void. The formation, however, had already been covered in a layer of green. Green vines sprouted from the cultivators, rapidly spreading towards their companions. Countless vines instantly filled the gaps within the formation.</p><p>The formation became a sea of green vines. As the rings of thunder expanded, green light emanated from the surface of the vines.</p><p>After a burst of lightning and flashes, the vines thinned considerably, but through the gaps, one could see that the people inside were unharmed.</p><p>The fourth wave, the fifth wave...</p><p>In Qin Sang's hands, the Twelve Thunder God Talismans exhibited an almost limitless variety of changes, with wave after wave of attacks, each different from the last.  This even surpassed the inherent capabilities of the Twelve Thunder God Talismans. Qin Sang had gained the inheritance within the Five Thunders Emissary's Seal, which granted him such profound understanding of the Way of Thunder.</p><p>Unfortunately, the enemy had countermeasures for everything. After several waves of attacks, their advance was only slowed.</p><p>It was clear that the Twelve Thunder God Talismans were about to be completely understood by the opponent.</p><p>However, this still wasn't the full extent of the talismans' power!</p><p>Qingyang Temple, main altar.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma Body chanted incantations silently. The altar beneath him vibrated, and the Thunder Gods far away in the Western Lands appeared simultaneously.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>Shi Mu's expression was grave as he looked at the Thunder Gods in the sky.</p><p>He noticed that the Thunder Gods' appearance was different from before. Their weapons faintly shimmered with a tinge of cyan.</p><p>Shi Mu's heart trembled. He exclaimed, "True Person Qin can actually utilize that Cyan Thunder in this way!"</p><p>Some of those present had previously experienced the power of the Cyan Phoenix True Thunder.  Qin Sang's attacks were already extremely fierce.  Infused with a trace of this thunder power, they would be even harder to withstand.</p><p>One hundred and twenty Thunder Gods simultaneously unleashing the Cyan Phoenix True Thunder – the very thought sent shivers down their spines!</p><p>Little did they know, if Qin Sang could use the Cyan Phoenix True Thunder to inscribe the Thunder Oath Chapter, he could also use it to inscribe third-grade spirit talismans. However, the grade of the Cyan Phoenix True Thunder was too high. Third-grade spirit talismans like the Twelve Thunder God Talismans couldn't fully contain it.  In the end, only a portion of its power was integrated, but the result was still extraordinary.</p><p>'Boom!'  The Thunder Gods raised their weapons, the tips shining with dazzling cyan light.</p><p>'Crack!' Cyan lightning bolts erupted from their weapons, slightly thinner and less imposing than the previous lightning.</p><p>The Cyan Thunder unleashed.</p><p>Its power far exceeded its appearance. Wherever it passed, chaos erupted within the formation. The silver mirrors and other defenses were rendered ineffective, and lives were reaped by the cyan lightning.</p><p>The several cultivators reacted quickly, resorting to various means. Some summoned spirit treasures, others called upon their companion beasts, and some unleashed divine abilities.</p><p>Shi Mu summoned a treasure.</p><p>It was a two-eared earthen jar, without a lid. Water could be heard sloshing inside, but the surface wasn't visible. The mouth of the jar was pitch black.</p><p>Shi Mu made a gesture, and a stream of clear water shot out, sprinkling down from the sky.  The clear water dispersed into a mist, incredibly thin, with many minute droplets falling onto the cultivators.</p><p>The cultivators, as if divinely inspired, began to circulate their Qi, their auras surging.</p><p>In the next moment, a rainbow appeared within the water mist, its other end stretching far beyond the Thunder Gods, its destination unknown.</p><p>This was their prepared method for breaking the formation, now forced into use.</p><p>If all went well, the cultivators would, after a period of distortion and transformation, merge into the rainbow, or rather, become a part of it.</p><p>At that time, only the rainbow would be visible, not the figures of the cultivators.</p><p>As the cultivators advanced along the rainbow bridge, each step they took caused the bridge to emit a peculiar wave, repelling the enemy.</p><p>Unwilling to return empty-handed again, Shi Mu decided to launch a counterattack.  The rainbow light rapidly spread throughout the formation.</p><p>Just then, on the left side of the formation, a silver-armored Void Realm Second Stage cultivator suddenly felt a sense of foreboding. He hastily summoned a companion beast, while not forgetting to transmit a warning to his companions.</p><p>The next moment, a white ferret appeared in front of the silver-armored cultivator.  Simultaneously, his own companion beast grunted and retreated repeatedly.</p><p>Bloodlust gleamed in the white ferret's eyes, its ferocity apparent.</p><p>"Frost Ferret!"</p><p>The silver-armored cultivator's heart tightened. He shouted, "It's Si Lu!"</p><p>His ambush attracted everyone's attention. The cultivator closest to him immediately moved to assist.</p><p>The Frost Ferret flickered, dodging the attack and vanishing without a trace.</p><p>At the same moment, on the other side of the formation, another shadow emerged.  A spirit tablet, as large as a mountain, slammed down towards a grey-robed cultivator without warning.</p><p>The grey-robed cultivator's heart lurched. He didn't forget to warn, "It's True Person Qin!"</p><p>He knew he wasn't Qin Sang's match, but retreat wasn't a long-term solution.  He opened his mouth and spat out a transparent object, resembling a jellyfish, which rapidly expanded in size.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The spirit tablet seemed to hit cotton. The 'jellyfish' was knocked back to its original form, but the grey-robed cultivator was unharmed.</p><p>For a time, cyan lightning flew, and the situation shifted rapidly, making it difficult to keep track.</p><p>The Twelve Thunder God Talismans were high-grade third-grade spirit talismans of the Dao Court, unleashed by Qin Sang's Dharma Body through the altar and further infused with Cyan Phoenix True Thunder power.  Fully activated, their might was unimaginable.</p><p>Under the barrage of cyan lightning, Shi Mu's formation struggled to maintain its integrity. The rainbow bridge was newly formed, and there wasn't enough time to reorganize the formation before Qin Sang and Si Lu appeared.</p><p>Shi Mu focused all his energy on the earthen jar. Shi Ying stood beside him, warding off the cyan lightning while remaining vigilant.</p><p>To his left, Si Lu's Frost Ferret was surrounded by two cultivators.</p><p>On the right, three others were attempting to encircle Qin Sang.</p><p>Suddenly, golden light filled the air.</p><p>A golden sun rose within the chaotic battlefield.  Sensing danger, the grey-robed cultivator's face paled as he retreated hastily.  He then saw a bolt of lightning hurtling towards him with terrifying speed.</p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p>The grey-robed cultivator yelled.</p><p>Two of his companions exchanged glances.  One threw a bronze seal, which slammed down from the sky, creating immense pressure in an attempt to suppress Qin Sang.</p><p>The other, an elderly man, summoned his companion beasts.  All three were identical:  without facial features or limbs, their heads were simply giant mouths, emitting a powerful suction force that locked onto Qin Sang.</p><p>Even the Heaven-Confining Golden Chains couldn't restrain Qin Sang, let alone a bronze seal.  Qin Sang's figure flickered, easily breaking free from the suppression. However, he didn't resist the suction force, allowing himself to be pulled towards the elderly man.</p><p>During the clash, the cultivators' attention wasn't solely on Qin Sang. They were also guarding against sneak attacks from others.  They had means of escape, but their opponent was Xia Changshi, and no one knew the extent of this fellow clansman's profound abilities, or whether he could cut off their retreat.</p><p>At this moment, the elderly man realized something was amiss when Qin Sang charged towards him.  He understood that Qin Sang was the greatest threat, and then saw two streaks of five-colored light shoot towards him in succession.</p><p>The True Five Elements Divine Light focused on imprisonment. The elderly man froze instantly, then the Inverse Five Elements Divine Light sought his life!</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu had experimented. Two consecutive bursts of Five Elements Divine Light had a chance of preventing the Si You Clan from using their interchanging technique, but the window of opportunity was fleeting because he could only restrain the opponent's true body, not their companion beast.</p><p>The reaction of the companion beast was only slightly slower than its master, and the will residing within it could still activate the technique.</p><p>This strike was impeccably timed. Caught off guard, the elderly man was almost hit by the Inverse Five Elements Divine Light.  Suddenly, a rich, profound yellow light surged from his body, accompanied by rippling waves, resembling a funnel in the void.</p><p>The elderly man's figure distorted as he was pulled into the funnel and vanished.</p><p>The Inverse Five Elements Divine Light brushed past him, failing to inflict any harm.</p><p>However, the display of the Five Elements Crown still startled everyone.  Shi Mu made an immediate decision, retracting the earthen jar, "Retreat!"</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew the Five Elements Crown, slowly turning around to see the Grand Protector standing at the edge of the Thunder Marsh, seemingly out of nowhere.</p><p>The two seemed to be able to see each other, engaging in a silent 'stare-down' across the distance!</p>
