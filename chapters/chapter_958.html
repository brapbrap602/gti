<h1>Chapter 950: Another Trial</h1><p>Finding the teleportation array on the fifth level, Qin Sang entered the sixth, noticeably more cautious.  The sixth level's puppets were the strongest, but they no longer posed a challenge to his swordsmanship. Qin Sang swiftly dispatched them, eventually locating the solitary, floating teleportation array.</p><p>Darkness and silence surrounded the array.  Qin Sang approached carefully, stepped onto it, and with a flash of light, found himself on the seventh level, facing a ruined mountain peak.</p><p>Assessing his surroundings, Qin Sang relaxed slightly; like the previous six levels, this one was deserted.</p><p>"Did those Nascent Soul cultivators not come to the Heavenly Tower?" he muttered, turning to the Corpse Puppet Pouch. "Friend, do you recall anything?"</p><p>"Nothing," came Bai's voice.</p><p>Qin Sang was disappointed. If Bai remembered any secrets of the Heavenly Tower, it might have helped him find the ancient teleportation array and cultivation techniques.  He couldn't force Bai's memory, though.</p><p>After surveying the area, Qin Sang pondered briefly, then vanished, activating a concealment technique and silently ascended.  Along the way, he noticed a disturbed restriction, possibly triggered by someone, but chose not to investigate further.</p><p>Soon, he reached the middle of the mountain.  Just as he prepared to continue, he heard a strange sound, his expression shifting. He accelerated, leaping across dozens of mountain fragments until he reached the large fragment containing the valley.  He quickly hid among a cluster of rocks, watching the valley intently.</p><p>The Heavenly Tower's seventh level lacked an upward teleportation array. The tower's space was a peculiar, magically created pocket dimension.  Cultivators speculated that these seven levels were only a part of the tower; countless had searched, but none had found the eighth level's entrance.  Many focused on anomalies, particularly the valley.</p><p>The valley's black thread restriction was extremely dangerous, even late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators avoided it. Nobody knew what lay beyond. Many suspected the teleportation array was located there.  The previous conflict between the Great Shaman and the Demon Lord, reportedly over an ancient treasure, likely occurred within the valley.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed several figures hovering outside the valley, peering inside.  Powerful fluctuations periodically emanated from within.</p><p>"Could those Nascent Soul cultivators really be trying to break the black thread restriction?" Qin Sang mused, glancing at the figures. A cold smile touched his lips.  "These people are incredibly reckless, trying to snatch treasures under the noses of two clans' Nascent Soul cultivators! They're courting death!"</p><p>He had no intention of joining the fray. Seeing no immediate breakthrough in the valley, he altered his course, soon reaching the entrance to the Sword Path.</p><p>Nobody would be interested in a completely decayed and collapsed ancient temple. Qin Sang ordered the Sky-Eye Butterfly to maintain vigilance, ensuring no one was watching. He set up a concealment restriction before summoning his ebony sword, using sword energy to open the entrance.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang slipped inside.</p><p>The brick-paved Sword Path remained unchanged since his last visit. He had copied the jade slip left by Elder Qingzhu before leaving, returning the original.  The jade slip still lay there. Elder Qingzhu's inscription spoke of his bitterness.</p><p>"Unforeseen circumstances… I didn't expect this to be Elder Qingzhu's final words."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the inscription, a look of sorrow on his face. He had heard many tales of Elder Qingzhu, yet sadly, never met him. Finding Elder Qingzhu's cultivation ground, only to learn of his likely demise at the hands of his enemies, was disheartening.</p><p>Collecting himself, Qin Sang approached the Sword Path, his expression serious.  The success of his sword-soul-forged external avatar hinged on whether it would be accepted by the Sword Path.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The avatar emerged from the Heavenly Corpse Coffin, standing beside Qin Sang.  Qin Sang had stored the avatar's artifacts; likely they wouldn't be usable within the Sword Path.</p><p>"When I enter, the Corpse Puppet Pouch might be sealed, don't worry…" Qin Sang explained the situation to Bai.</p><p>Bai's voice echoed from the pouch, "This Sword Path, combined with the puppets on the previous six levels, is very much like a sect's training ground. If the restrictions within the Sword Path are as remarkable as you say, this force was quite powerful.  It's a pity I remember nothing…"</p><p>After a brief conversation with Bai, Qin Sang gestured to his external avatar and stepped into the Sword Path.</p><p>A fathom out, an anomaly appeared.</p><p>A brilliant green light erupted from the tunnel ceiling, descending rapidly.  Qin Sang's heart pounded; he'd invested immense effort cultivating this peak Foundation Establishment-stage body double, and he wasn't about to lose it here.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The green light, carrying terrifying pressure, was about to engulf them when it abruptly dissipated.  A familiar scene repeated itself: remaining green lights targeted Qin Sang, sealing all his treasures except for his ebony sword.</p><p>To Qin Sang's immense relief, his body double remained unharmed.</p><p>“Elder Qingzhu left the *Seed of the Demon Embryo* for a reason! This demonic body double technique allows those below the Nascent Soul stage to pass the sword path trials. Otherwise, unless you're like me, a dual cultivation practitioner, you'd likely need to grasp sword intent and form a sword array to withstand the attack of two top-tier swordsmen…”</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed, his worries completely gone.</p><p>Then, the blue bricks on either side of the tunnel glowed, and two figures leaped out—the same two swordsmen.  After a deep bow, they attacked.</p><p>In high spirits, Qin Sang returned the bow before ordering his body double to engage.  The body double, lacking magical treasures, still easily overpowered the swordsmen.  After a few exchanges, the swordsmen were cornered and conceded defeat.</p><p>“Protect me,” Qin Sang instructed the body double, taking a deep breath. He summoned the ebony sword and stepped forward.</p><p>He planned to immerse himself in combat as before, further refining his swordsmanship and improving his sword cultivation. With his body double protecting him, he could focus without fear, allowing for a timely rescue should things go wrong.</p><p>He might not return to this place, so he couldn't miss this precious opportunity. This sword path trial would greatly benefit him; even without grasping sword intent, it would enhance his sword wheel's power.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The two swordsmen reappeared only to be pierced through the chest by Qin Sang's sword, returning to the blue bricks.  His enhanced strength rendered the remaining swordsmen insignificant. He swiftly progressed, effortlessly traversing a significant portion of the sword path.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang reached the point where he had previously stopped.  His relaxed expression faltered slightly; he suppressed some of his cultivation and took another step.</p>
