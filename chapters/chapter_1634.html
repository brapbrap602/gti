<h1>Chapter 1625:  The Jade Tower of Langzhong</h1><p>Chapter 1625:  The Jade Tower of Langzhong</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the treasures obtained from the Water Phase Lord's suspected tomb: a mysterious ice disc and two spirit pills.  His external incarnation used the ice disc to cultivate the "Ice Soul Divine Light" technique and sensed an opportunity for a breakthrough, but could only utilize the disc's power superficially.  Qin Sang believed he had not yet unlocked its true potential. The two spirit pills remained a mystery, gathering dust. The mysterious ice disc remained with his external incarnation.</p><p>The incarnation took out the treasure. The internal landscape of the ice disc shifted constantly, flashing images of an ice palace every few breaths. A section of the ice palace visible ahead was part of this image.  Qin Sang flew to another mountain peak, gaining a clearer view.</p><p>The mysterious ice disc, being a relic of the Water Phase Lord, undoubtedly had a significant connection to the Wu Xiang Sect.  Qin Sang hadn't expected the ice palace image to be real, however, unsure which existed first, the palace or the disc.</p><p>"The Water Phase Palace?"</p><p>Qin Sang suspected the ice palace was the location of the Water Phase lineage's inheritance within the Wu Xiang Sect. Having found a Water Phase lineage inheritance, it was an opportunity not to be missed. His incarnation, skilled in ice-type cultivation techniques, might gain further fortuitous encounters in the ice palace.  At the very least, he needed to determine the function of the disc and the pills.  Initially, Qin Sang had analyzed the disc as a kind of array eye.</p><p>"Could it be the treasure that suppresses the ice palace's main formation array eye?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.  If so, he would be somewhat disappointed.  He wouldn't allow others to rest comfortably near his bed. With the appearance of this legacy, regardless of which faction controlled it, it was impossible for him to allow anyone to occupy a cave dwelling here.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The main body and the incarnation didn't linger, quickly flying away. Qin Sang's gaze swept across the Jade Tower of Langzhong, already planning his next move; he decided to continue exploring separately with his incarnation and main body.</p><p>The northern wasteland held the Water Phase Lord's suspected tomb.  The entrance to the Wu Xiang Sect featured a stone tablet of the Earth Phase Hall. The Wu Xiang Sect's inheritance was related to the Five Elements.  Five types of inheritance, along with the scripture library, treasure forge, and pill refinement areas—places most likely to contain treasures—were hardly enough for the sect's Grand Cultivators to divide.  Not to mention, Old Devil Fan might escape at any moment, with Wu Xiang Sect remnants and Daoist masters following close behind.  If he stayed at the Jade Tower of Langzhong for a long time, by the time he emerged, the ice palace would likely be taken by others.</p><p>...</p><p>The peak where the Jade Tower of Langzhong stood was considered precipitous, even among the countless peaks of the Wu Xiang Sect. Yet, the mountain's shape wasn't particularly sharp.  Clear springs flowed, ancient trees provided shade, and misty clouds hung like dark eyebrows—a refreshing and timeless scene.  The reason the incarnation could see the Jade Tower of Langzhong from afar was that the jade tower was too eye-catching.</p><p>A platform had been carved out of the mountainside, and the jade tower was built upon it. The mountain above the platform was cut straight, forming a sheer cliff. The tower stood against the cliff, a thousand meters tall, reaching into the sky, its peak even extending beyond the summit. On the cliff face, to one side of the jade tower, four ancient characters were carved—Jade Tower of Langzhong.</p><p>Two figures appeared at the foot of the mountain. Qin Sang and his external incarnation arrived, noticing a stone tablet before the mountain path inscribed with the words "Path of Inquiry," confirming they had found the right place. The main body went to the stone tablet, while the incarnation paused briefly before continuing north towards the ice palace.</p><p>...</p><p>The Five Phase Halls surrounded Mount Di, but their distances from the mountain were unequal, some near, some far.  Their distribution lacked any clear pattern; the only discernible regularity was their construction following the flow of spiritual veins. North of Mount Di. The peaks here were lower than elsewhere. As far as the eye could see, vast forests stretched out, green waves covering the undulating hills. The trees were particularly lush. Ancient trees towered, their canopies like canopies, clouds and mist flowing between them, lingering and adding a chilly atmosphere to the forest.</p><p>A figure leaped through the treetops.  Getting closer, one realized the canopies the person traversed were taller than the surrounding ones; these canopies formed a path in the clouds, winding into the depths of the forest.  Parting the concealing branches.  The person was actually walking on a series of wooden bridges, hidden among the treetops, creating a concealed path.  However, the bridges were dilapidated, severely damaged in many places, clearly the remnants of cultivator battles, revealing a glimpse of the past great war.  Restrictions were heavily layered on the bridges; each step the person took met with great resistance.  Above their head, strange lights flickered, a small token slowly rotating—the Wood Phase Token!</p><p>This person was the strange-faced man. After separating from the Weeping Spirit Cave Master, he came alone, seeking the Wood Phase Hall.</p><p>He had been here for an unknown amount of time.  His scarred face showed impatience; he kept glancing towards the cliff. The treasures of the Mu Xiang Palace were important, but the opportunities within the Immortal Palace couldn't be missed! As long as he held the treasures of the Mu Xiang Palace, he wouldn't fear the Lord of the Qi Ling Cave going back on his word.  His worry was that Zhu Wu Dao would act tyrannically, and the Lord of the Qi Ling Cave wouldn't be able to stop him.</p><p>"The Mu Xiang Order can't control the outer perimeter restrictions!"</p><p>The scarred-faced man was somewhat agitated, but could only slowly advance, bridge by bridge.  "When I reach the Mu Xiang Palace and open the main hall, it should be of some use…"</p><p>His thoughts raced.</p><p>The scarred-faced man passed through a forest and finally saw the silhouette of a palace ahead.  The palace was built atop the tree canopy, vibrant with green light and brimming with life.  Everything was made of wood; some chambers were even carved directly into the trees.</p><p>The Cloudwood Palace was naturally harmonious. Every corner blended perfectly with nature, seamlessly integrated into the forest without any jarring effect.</p><p>This was the Mu Xiang Palace!</p><p>The scarred-faced man's expression brightened. He surged forward, but was stopped by the restrictions.  He let out a cold snort. A faint green glow suddenly appeared on his body. With a thunderous "boom," his body, like a heavy hammer, forcefully smashed through the restrictions, charging all the way to the palace gate in one go.</p><p>The green glow faded.</p><p>The scarred-faced man breathed a sigh of relief. He glanced at the main hall in the center of the Cloudwood Palace, then turned his head towards the cliff before entering.</p><p>From time to time, a blue light shot up from the cliff, then faded into silence.</p><p>The sight was strange, unlike the normal activation of a teleportation array. It was unexpected.  The distance was vast, with restrictions and mist obstructing the view, so what he could see was the limit.  The scarred-faced man frowned, unable to figure out what was happening there.</p><p>For some reason, he suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><p>Without hesitation, the scarred-faced man dashed into the Cloudwood Palace.</p><p>…</p><p>In the valley bottom between two mountains.</p><p>The area was in ruins, crisscrossed with ravines, severely damaged.</p><p>The vegetation was devastated; half was withered from the incursion of blood energy, the other half entirely frozen by frost, their life extinguished.</p><p>Clearly, a fierce battle had just taken place.</p><p>On a mountainside, Su Zi Nan stood with his hands behind his back, gazing intently at the cliff, also captivated by the spectacle on it.  He wasn't a descendant of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect; key information had been intentionally withheld from him, so he could only rely on the secrets his foster father had told him and the information he had gathered during his travels to make his deductions.</p><p>"Could it be the entrance to the Immortal Palace? Mo Xing Dao should be rushing there…"</p><p>Su Zi Nan pursed his lips, looking down at the valley.</p><p>The valley floor was now in utter chaos.</p><p>A howling wind whipped up a blizzard.</p><p>It seemed as if there was an underground river; waves of water surged into the sky, deafeningly loud. When the water collided with the cold, powerful waves were generated, sweeping across the valley and continually spreading outwards.</p><p>However, no matter how strong the waves were, they were confined to the valley, unable to affect the outside world, because a large crimson net sealed off the top of the valley.</p><p>The crimson net trembled repeatedly under the impact, yet it remained remarkably resilient.</p><p>Below the crimson net, a figure stood in mid-air – Wu Lao, who was now under Su Zi Nan's control.</p><p>Wu Lao wielded the Blood Drinking Devil Halberd, using the great divine ability, the Heaven-Stabilizing Halberd, from his lifetime.</p><p>The halberd's shadow multiplied.</p><p>The astonishing pressure actually suppressed the cold.</p><p>At that moment, a blue light shot out from the cold, encasing a pale white water droplet.</p><p>The ice bead showed no power, yet Su Zi Nan's expression turned serious. He suddenly pointed his two fingers at the valley, and magical light shot out, transforming into a black ruler.</p><p>In an instant, the black ruler pierced through the crimson net and appeared above the water droplet.  The ruler's shadow filled the sky, omnipresent.</p><p>Thousands of ruler shadows suddenly converged, and with overwhelming power, struck the water droplet.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The water droplet exploded.</p><p>However, whether it was triggered by the ruler shadows or exploded on its own remained unknown.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A sound like thunder rolled.</p><p>Streams of white water, like ribbons, shot out from the water droplet.  Unfortunately, half were forcibly suppressed by the black ruler in place, their light dimming as they fell to the valley floor.</p><p>Wu Lao raised the Blood Drinking Devil Halberd high into the air. Its tip trembled slightly, and the halberd multiplied, stabbing downwards furiously.</p><p>In the next moment, a devil halberd appeared above each stream of water, locking onto its target.</p><p>Su Zi Nan's pupils turned blood red, but he didn't look at the water droplet or any of the water streams. His gaze pierced through the various phenomena, focusing on the mountain wall to the side of the valley. His left hand, behind his back, silently made a hand seal.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>A blood array, shaped like a talismanic disk, suddenly appeared from the earth.</p><p>This was the talismanic disk Su Zi Nan had placed there beforehand.</p><p>A powerful energy emanated from the talisman, its range vast. Crimson runes crisscrossed, like the blood vessels of a mountain range, everywhere.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Rocks shattered.  A large hole exploded in the mountain wall, revealing a treasure mirror within.</p><p>Inside the mirror, a white figure was trapped, the mirror's surface entangled by countless blood threads, forcing its appearance.  The figure, hair disheveled and in disarray, was Yan Shan Laoren.</p><p>A loud *hum* resonated as the mirror shattered the blood threads.  The white figure rapidly faded, about to disappear, when the mirror was suddenly enveloped in demonic light. A shadowy figure appeared above the mirror!</p><p>“Heh, you have quite the escape skills, friend. If not for my carefully laid trap, you would've slipped away…”</p><p>Su Zinan's figure appeared at the cave entrance, blocking the light.  His expression darkened.</p><p>In the valley, a fragment of a water droplet suddenly transformed into a phantom, swiftly darting towards the valley exit.</p><p>Wu Lao moved with incredible speed. His Blood-Drinking Halberd flashed, piercing the phantom. A resounding wave echoed as the phantom dissolved into a pool of water, its form shifting and changing.</p><p>At that moment, two ghostly figures, the remaining two evil shadows of the Three Corpse Death Banner, shrieked and lunged into the water, tearing frantically.</p><p>Su Zinan, still uneasy, surveyed the valley, chuckling darkly.  “Why not quickly offer your Nascent Soul, friend? Enjoy eternal life within my Divine Banner, wouldn't that be delightful?”</p><p>…</p><p>Before the entrance to the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>The Cloud Dragon crumbled.</p><p>The cloud wall had expanded dozens of times its original size, its overwhelming power barring the entrance.  Only after this energy dissipated could things begin to return to normal.</p><p>Then,</p><p>a fissure suddenly ripped open in the inner cloud wall, with swirling clouds, occasional flashes of demonic light, poisonous mist, and fist shadows erupting.</p><p>A figure burst free – Fan Laomo.</p><p>Two more figures followed, Poison King and Huaiyin Master, arriving from behind.</p><p>Huaiyin Master, barefoot and in simple robes, stepped calmly from the cloud wall, seemingly untouched by the inner turmoil.</p><p>The fissure began to close.</p><p>A puff of poisonous mist drifted out, condensing to reveal the Poison King.</p><p>Fan Laomo was far more disheveled than the others, his robes torn.</p><p>A soft, sinister laugh echoed behind them.</p><p>Tian Hao Tower's Grand Elder, Fan Laomo, whose demonic reputation instilled fear, drew no reaction from the Poison King, who laughed freely.</p><p>“Even the mighty Grand Elder of Tian Hao Tower has fallen to this!”</p><p>While breaking through the cloud wall, the Poison King and Huaiyin Master had learned the truth.  Fan Laomo, feeling humiliated, his robes shining with magical light, restored to their pristine state, roared,  “That insidious scoundrel! The Cloud Dragon's collapse was no coincidence; he’s involved! I won't let him get away with ruining my plans!”</p><p>“Old Devil, if you're not hiding anything, that person's cultivation is at least equal to ours, and he could even outmaneuver you. I doubt you're a match for him.”</p><p>The Poison King taunted, enjoying Fan Laomo's frustration. He was delighted at the prospect of a fight to the death between the two.</p><p>After a period of flight, they saw a range of mountains.</p><p>The Poison King murmured, “Is this the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect?”</p><p>“Zi Lei Daoist and Yue Laogui have already entered, so it must be true,” Fan Laomo said, his anger seemingly forgotten.</p><p>“Interesting!  Zi Lei Daoist's appearance in Jinyu State was a fake. The Eight Scenic Views strictly guards the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, yet secretly allows the sect's remnants to restart the Legacy Mansion. How peculiar.”</p><p>The Poison King secretly transmitted information to Huaiyin Master, revealing various secrets of the Central Plains.  He glanced sideways at Fan Laomo, “Old Devil, you skipped the Dharma Assembly and came to Nanjiang; you’ve been after them for a while, haven't you?”</p><p>“You too,”</p><p>Fan Laomo chuckled nervously, eyeing Huaiyin Master with a hint of apprehension, now aware of his background. He pondered, "The Cloud Dragon delayed us; we're hours behind. One side is the Daoist sect; the other is the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect's remnants – their strength is considerable…"</p><p>He was interrupted by the Poison King, “Old Devil, when did you become so hesitant! We’ve already lost the advantage; without cooperation, we'll just watch them loot the treasures!”</p><p>Fan Laomo laughed, swallowing his instinctive retort.  “You’re more decisive than I expected.”</p><p>Huaiyin Master said, “Legend has it that the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect once controlled the Immortal Palace?”</p><p>“Correct,” the Poison King looked around, then fixed his gaze on the cliff face.  “The Wu Xiang remnants must be targeting the Immortal Palace first. The Daoists' intentions are unclear, but they won't easily let the remnants succeed!  The place with the most obvious signs will likely be the Immortal Palace entrance!”</p><p>Fan Laomo curiously asked, “Does the Western Lands have an Immortal Palace?”</p><p>Huaiyin Master shook his head, “Never heard of it.”</p><p>(End)</p>
