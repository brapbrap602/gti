<h1></h1><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>……</p><p>Within the fissures of the Thousand Buddha Wall, a figure fled as if his life depended on it, pursued relentlessly by a tide of crimson-gold light flames formed from Buddha light and crimson fire.</p><p>Qin Sang wielded the Gold Sink Sword to clear the path, not daring to pause for even a moment.</p><p>He had retaliated against Old Devil Hunmo with Demonic Fire, then turned and fled, uncertain of the effect it would have or whether it would buy Mu Gu Master and the others time to escape.</p><p>'Bang! Bang!'</p><p>The sound of sword light clashing echoed incessantly.</p><p>Qin Sang ventured deeper and deeper.</p><p>Within his sight, the only colors were crimson and gold.</p><p>It was unimaginable how much crimson fire aura had accumulated here over countless years. After being released continuously for so long, so much still remained.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the original spirit formation should not have been this powerful. Influenced by the crimson fire aura, the spirit formation had mutated, increasing its power to such an astonishing level.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang felt the light before him suddenly dim, and he immediately became vigilant.</p><p>He forcefully unleashed a sword strike forward.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The sword light separated the Buddha light and crimson fire, and Qin Sang dashed out.</p><p>The next moment, he felt the pressure on him lessen sharply. The surrounding light was no longer so glaring, and the monotonous crimson and gold colors were replaced by colorful and radiant light.</p><p>More strangely, the violent fluctuations behind him also vanished into thin air at the same moment.</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished and turned to survey his surroundings.</p><p>It was the same as before.</p><p>The position he was in was still unsupported by either heaven or earth, with no place to stand.</p><p>Colorful radiant light was visible everywhere, some connected in patches, some condensed into clumps.</p><p>Radiant light of various colors filled the entire void, creating a beautiful sight. However, no matter what kind of radiant light it was, it was permeated with familiar crimson fire aura, omnipresent.</p><p>Illusory, ethereal.</p><p>No real objects could be seen.</p><p>Clearly, Qin Sang's previous guess was correct. Passing through the Thousand Buddha Wall only meant transitioning from one variation of the spirit formation to another.</p><p>He was still within the spirit formation.</p><p>But what was surprising was that the Thousand Buddha Wall was nowhere to be seen behind Qin Sang!</p><p>He had clearly just emerged from the Thousand Buddha Wall, yet it had vanished into thin air. Behind him was boundless radiant light, with no familiar scenery visible.</p><p>"This… have I fallen into another layer of the spirit formation's variations?"</p><p>Qin Sang was doubtful.</p><p>He stopped where he was, not moving rashly, and observed intently with the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>No matter how powerful a spirit formation was, there would definitely be patterns to follow, especially since this formation was masterless and its variations were limited.</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>Just then.</p><p>A sharp whistling sound suddenly came from within the radiant light.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly and immediately felt a prickling sensation on his skin, as if locked on by a sharp intent. A warning arose in his heart, and he immediately turned the Gold Sink Sword floating above his head, as if facing a formidable enemy.</p><p>'Buzz…'</p><p>The spirit sword let out a long hum.</p><p>The whistling sound grew closer and closer, with astonishing speed.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang saw the radiant light distort and disappear in that direction, revealing a black hole. A dazzling golden light, carrying the aura of destroying everything, charged straight towards Qin Sang!</p><p>This golden light was extremely pure.</p><p>Since entering the spirit formation, the crimson fire aura had been present in every scene Qin Sang had witnessed. Only this golden light was an exception.</p><p>From this, it seemed that this might be the original attack method of the spirit formation.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly. Not daring to be careless, he fully activated the Gold Sink Sword, preparing to unleash a sword strike and contend with the golden light head-on.</p><p>Suddenly, his gaze flickered, as if he had thought of something. He hesitated for a moment, then made a strange move, retracting the Gold Sink Sword, and then shifting his body several dozen feet away.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The golden light arrived, and it was faintly discernible that its true form seemed to be a Zen staff conjured by the spirit formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's dodging caused the Zen staff to change direction.</p><p>The staff body shifted sideways, but only by a few feet. It was too late to catch up with Qin Sang, and it brushed past him, disappearing into the depths of the radiant light.</p><p>Qin Sang's protective divine essence was impacted by the staff's fluctuations and rippled slightly, but that was all.</p><p>He himself was completely unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the place where the Zen staff had disappeared and exhaled a breath. He thought to himself, "As expected! If it were the original spirit formation, this Zen staff would not have been so easy to avoid. If someone were manipulating it from outside, it would be even harder to deal with. Now that the spirit formation is affected by the crimson fire aura, it has power to spare, but lacks variation. It looks dangerous, but it is actually easy to handle…"</p><p>This initial attempt confirmed Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>Of course, this did not mean he could be careless.</p><p>There would always be places like the Thousand Buddha Wall, unavoidable and more dangerous than before.</p><p>"Now it seems that I have entered the second variation from the first variation of the spirit formation. It's like going through levels. I wonder how many levels there are in total?</p><p>"Old Devil Hunmo definitely didn't follow us in right from the start, otherwise the Skyeye Butterfly would have detected him long ago. Looking at it this way, the encounters of all intruders should be similar.</p><p>"If Mu Gu Master doesn't die, he will definitely come to this 'space' after passing through the Thousand Buddha Wall, but he may not appear near me. Also, where did the Thousand Buddha Wall go?</p><p>"The Thousand Buddha Wall should be the manifestation of the barrier between two variations of the spirit formation. Since I came out from there, I should be able to find it if I go back, but the scenery seen inside and outside is different, so it may not be the Thousand Buddha Wall."</p><p>Qin Sang calmed down, analyzed what he had seen and heard, and pondered the patterns of the spirit formation.</p><p>As he was pondering, the Skyeye Butterfly conveyed a thought, seemingly having discovered something.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up into the depths of the radiant light, his figure flashing repeatedly.</p><p>Within the radiant light, crimson fire drifted. Once touched, it could easily cause a large area to shake.</p><p>If the attacks of the spirit formation could not be avoided, it would be really difficult to deal with.</p><p>Here, the radiant light stretched endlessly, and crimson fire covered the sky, like fiery red evening clouds.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped and went, sometimes approaching the radiant light to look closely, sometimes frowning in thought.</p><p>Gradually, a helpless expression appeared on his face.</p><p>"This place has completely different patterns from the Thousand Buddha Wall. The crimson fire aura and the radiant light are inseparable. By the time I figure out the patterns and open up a way back, it will be too late…"</p><p>Going back to save people was not feasible.</p><p>What if he had just returned and Mu Gu Master was killed by Old Devil Hunmo, instead sending himself into a dangerous situation.</p><p>"Waiting here to save people also has a very small chance. The formation is so complex, the one who laid out the formation clearly wants to move the intruders to different locations and defeat them one by one, and it cannot be determined whether Mu Gu Master can escape here…"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts flickered rapidly, deciding to wait a little longer.</p><p>The result was as expected.</p><p>"The three of you should wish yourselves good fortune."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly and turned to leave.</p><p>He couldn't think of any good solutions. For now, he had to move forward alone and explore the Pure Sea Sect. If Mu Gu Master could escape from Old Devil Hunmo, they would meet again at the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>Fortunately, the Fire Jade Centipede was Qin Sang's spirit insect, guiding him in the direction.</p><p>It would be worth the trip to obtain the Myriad Spirit Fruit.</p><p>As for other treasures, he would have to act according to circumstances.</p>
