<h1></h1><p>The herb garden was a matter for later.</p><p>The strange-faced man's legacy was the true prize of this venture.</p><p>With a cursory glance, Qin Sang discovered quite a few things that stirred his heart.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved some True Essence Replenishing Pills and shared them with his avatar. While recovering their True Essence, he took out the strange-faced man's Mustard Seed Bag and began to examine it carefully.</p><p>Inside, there weren't many magical treasures, spirit pills, talismans, or similar external objects. In fact, there were surprisingly few, not befitting his cultivation level.</p><p>For many years, the strange-faced man had devoted himself to cultivating the Gu King, refining his poison skills, and dealing with the intense poison within his body.</p><p>Later, after the Gu King matured, he obtained the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree, cultivated the Acquired Wooden Figure Stele, and prepared to open the Legacy of the Formless Immortal Sect.  He had no spare energy for anything else.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense stirred the Mustard Seed Bag, and several streaks of light flew out.</p><p>He reached out and grabbed a wooden box.</p><p>Opening it, he found a cluster of azure light within.  As his divine sense swept over it, the refining method for the Heavenly Exquisite Jade appeared in Qin Sang's sea of consciousness.  This secret art, exclusive to the Wooden Aspect Hall, was finally in his hands.</p><p>The refining method was complete, even including insights left by past Hall Masters of the Wooden Aspect Hall.</p><p>Seeing it with his own eyes, Qin Sang realized refining the Heavenly Exquisite Jade wasn't as easy as the strange-faced man had suggested.</p><p>The refiner must first possess profound skill in the Dao of Artifact Refinement and have a cultivation level no lower than late Nascent Soul.</p><p>This treasure aided in reaching Deity Transformation, so its value was self-evident.</p><p>However, if someone wanted to refine the Heavenly Exquisite Jade to trade, they would still need to carefully weigh the gains and losses, which showed the difficulty of refining this treasure.</p><p>Refining the Heavenly Exquisite Jade was no small feat, requiring spiritual materials that were rare heavenly treasures. Even Qin Sang, a master artifact refiner, didn't recognize several of them.</p><p>The other streaks of light contained jade slips, some of which detailed the artifact refinement heritage of the Wooden Aspect Hall.</p><p>When the Formless Immortal Sect flourished, the Wooden Aspect Hall was renowned for its artifact refinement. This heritage would undoubtedly be of great help to Qin Sang.  In the future, when he could devote himself to refining artifacts, his skills would surely advance by leaps and bounds. This was a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the heritage of both the alchemy and artifact refinement branches of the Formless Immortal Sect had fallen into his hands.</p><p>Combining the contents of the jade slips, Qin Sang found records of those unfamiliar spiritual materials. Some could still be found in the world with diligent searching, but others relied solely on luck.</p><p>Especially a spiritual object called Moon Laurel Immortal Dew, the rarest of all, produced in the Immortal Laurel Secret Realm of the Heavenly Harmony Hall. Access was granted only once every few hundred years.</p><p>The strange-faced man hadn't been able to find Moon Laurel Immortal Dew within the Wooden Aspect Hall.</p><p>Now that the Immortal Halls had ascended, the Immortal Laurel Secret Realm was inaccessible. Where could he find it?</p><p>The refining method for the Heavenly Exquisite Jade didn't mention this information. The strange-faced man had deliberately erased it; otherwise, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master wouldn't have been so optimistic.</p><p>Of course, there were exceptions.  A Nascent Soul cultivator from the Formless Immortal Sect, while traveling in the outer regions of the storm belt, had stumbled upon an ancient cultivator's legacy and obtained a small vial.</p><p>It might still exist somewhere in this world, hidden within some unknown ancient cultivator's legacy.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed five elemental spiritual roots, making the Heavenly Exquisite Jade useless to him.  But seeing all this, he couldn't help feeling disappointed. Without all the necessary spiritual materials, the value of this secret art was greatly diminished.  He would have to carefully consider how to maximize its benefit.</p><p>The strange-faced man hadn't only concealed this from the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to the last streak of light and gently beckoned it.</p><p>In his hand, he held a crystal-clear jade sphere, the size of a baby's fist, emitting a pure emerald light. It shimmered like a night pearl.</p><p>The jade sphere was the Heavenly Exquisite Jade!</p><p>However, this Heavenly Exquisite Jade was an unfinished embryonic form.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze, peering through the emerald light and noticing imperfections within the jade.</p><p>The surface of the sphere wasn't smooth, but dotted with countless tiny voids. These voids were so small that they were imperceptible without careful sensing.</p><p>Within each void were inscribed countless restrictions, their intricacy unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen.  Few treasures in this world could compare, and this was only the sphere's first layer.</p><p>The Heavenly Exquisite Jade could be seen as five nested jade spheres.</p><p>All five layers possessed the same level of intricate craftsmanship.</p><p>When the Heavenly Exquisite Jade was complete, the five spheres had to be fused into one, their energies perfectly balanced without conflict.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, Qin Sang realized that the Heavenly Exquisite Jade wasn't entirely solid. It existed between reality and illusion, capable of merging with any type of natal magical treasure.</p><p>Back then, the Hall Master of the Wooden Aspect Hall had refined this embryonic form and placed it in the artifact chamber, nurturing it with the Hall's unique artifact refinement spirit array. Later, when the great war erupted, the Hall Master perished, leaving this treasure behind in the Wooden Aspect Hall, gathering dust, unknown to anyone.</p><p>When the strange-faced man discovered this treasure, he was overjoyed. Although the embryonic form was far from complete, at least he no longer needed to worry about Moon Laurel Immortal Dew.</p><p>He wouldn't have given it to the Weeping Spirit Cave Master even if he had several of them.</p><p>The artifact refinement heritage of the Wooden Aspect Hall and the embryonic Heavenly Exquisite Jade alone were worth the cost of a Boiling Snow Pill, let alone the fact that Qin Sang had paid almost no price.</p><p>Qin Sang marveled at his good fortune, carefully storing the treasures away.  He stirred the Mustard Seed Bag again, and three more clusters of radiant light flew out.</p><p>A token, a wooden armor, and a broken tree.</p><p>The token was the Wooden Aspect Token.</p><p>From searching the Weeping Spirit Cave Master's soul, Qin Sang learned that the Five Aspect Tokens seemed to have some significant role in the Emperor Bestowal Mountain.  He didn't understand the details, so he put it away for now, waiting to see its effects later.</p><p>The wooden armor was frozen by the Ice Soul Divine Light. After the strange-faced man's demise, it fell into Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>This treasure was undoubtedly a powerful defensive artifact, but he needed to erase the strange-faced man's aura and carefully refine it before he could use it. He set it aside along with the broken tree.</p><p>The broken tree was the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree.</p><p>The strange-faced man had self-destructed his spirit wood body, shattering the tree. Its essence remained, and a portion survived. However, the tree had been refined by the strange-faced man for many years, tainted with his aura.  Now it could only be used for artifact refinement.</p><p>Qin Sang was more interested in the strange-faced man's divine abilities: the Spirit Wood Body and the poison needles.</p><p>He continued searching, finally finding a piece of withered wood within the Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>The withered wood was less than a foot long and as thick as a wrist, entirely black. It appeared to be a completely rotten piece of wood, showing no abnormalities even under his divine sense.</p><p>If it were anywhere else, Qin Sang wouldn't have given it a second glance.</p><p>But when he carefully searched with his divine sense and touched an almost imperceptible point of light at the wood's core, he realized there was something else hidden inside!</p><p>The withered wood contained records of several heritages of the Wooden Aspect Hall, seemingly left behind by its descendants.</p><p>The heritages included the strange-faced man's core cultivation method, the Wood Emperor Scripture, and its corresponding divine abilities, including the Acquired Wooden Figure Stele that Qin Sang had been thinking about!</p><p>Cultivating these divine abilities required finding spirit wood and refining a Spirit Wood Body, granting immense strength comparable to a body cultivator, just like the strange-faced man.</p><p>Within a forest rich in wood spiritual energy, one could become like a divine stele, rooted to the earth, connected to all vegetation, absorbing wood spiritual energy, and gaining all-around enhancements in both strength and recovery.</p><p>Qin Sang now understood why the transformed strange-faced man had been so difficult to deal with.</p><p>And the strange-faced man had only achieved minor completion of this divine ability.  Upon major completion, there were many more incredible abilities, although reaching that level in the Nascent Soul stage was extremely difficult.</p><p>Additionally, the enhancements granted by the Acquired Wooden Figure Stele were also related to the quality of the spirit wood.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at his avatar.</p><p>Back then, the Dao Manifestation Tree could make Bai lose control.  What other spirit tree had a higher rank than the Dao Manifestation Tree?</p><p>However, if he were to refine the Dao Manifestation Tree into a Spirit Wood Body and integrate it into himself, he would have to restore the tree to its original form, abandoning his external avatar.  This was a difficult choice to make.</p><p>The Acquired Wooden Figure Stele held great potential, enhancing his own body, but his external avatar had the ability to die and be reborn, and he had already invested a tremendous amount of effort and resources into it.</p><p>Refining a Spirit Wood Body was also no easy task.</p><p>His external avatar was about to break through to late Nascent Soul, its potential not necessarily inferior to the Spirit Wood Body.  The death and rebirth ability was a powerful divine ability he couldn't afford to lose.</p><p>Even with his late Nascent Soul cultivation, Qin Sang didn't dare claim invincibility.</p><p>With a sigh, he put aside these troubling thoughts for the time being and stored the withered wood away. He then took out another jade slip.</p><p>This jade slip contained the Ten Thousand Poison Mountain's Gu Scripture, and it was complete.</p><p>The latter half of the Gu Scripture didn't record the Gu King cultivation method, but the descriptions suggested the Gu King was derived from the same lineage as the scripture.</p><p>The Gu King cultivation method must have been a core secret of the Ten Thousand Poison Mountain. Qin Sang didn't know how the strange-faced man had obtained it, but he had essentially looted part of the Ten Thousand Poison Mountain's heritage.</p><p>No wonder they hated him so much.</p><p>The latter part of the Gu Scripture recorded several poison path divine abilities, the most powerful of which was the Heaven Severing Soul Stirring Divine Needle.</p><p>The name, implying the power to annihilate all living beings and ghostly creatures upon release, was grand and befitting its power.</p><p>Cultivating this divine ability required a potent poison as a catalyst, but refining the poison required caution.  Being too hasty would cause the poison to invade one's internal organs, resulting in death before mastering the skill.</p><p>The strange-faced man had undoubtedly used the Gu King to cultivate this divine ability.</p><p>Qin Sang looked away from the Gu Scripture, his gaze falling on the demonic fire floating within the cave, a contemplative look on his face.</p><p>After devouring its master, the Gu King's crimson color gradually faded, almost returning to its original jade white.  But its ferocious nature hadn't diminished; instead, it seemed to be intensifying.</p><p>He didn't know how to subdue the Gu King and had been using the demonic fire to imprison it.  Even after examining the Gu Scripture and the strange-faced man's treasures, he hadn't found a method to subdue it.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang understood.</p><p>The Ten Thousand Poison Mountain had revealed this information because they were certain that even if he killed the strange-faced man, he wouldn't be able to subdue the Gu King and would have to trade with them.</p><p>The Gu King's poisonous light was extraordinary, and its rank was extremely high, making its value immeasurable.</p><p>“What will the Ten Thousand Poison Mountain offer in exchange?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered but didn't hold high expectations.</p><p>If possible, he'd rather subdue the Gu King himself and control this powerful weapon. At the very least, he wanted to consult with Ghost Mother before considering a trade.</p><p>But he needed to enter the Emperor Bestowal Mountain, and this wasn't a long-term solution.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Gu King for a while, a thought suddenly occurring to him.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's poison pearl could counter the Heaven Severing Soul Stirring Divine Needle.  Could he use the poison pearl to suppress the Gu King's ferocity? That would be enough to keep it in check while he was at the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>He decided to put his idea into action.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed his mind within his Qi Sea, activating the poison pearl.</p><p>Seven-colored light erupted from his dantian as the poison pearl slowly flew out, drifting toward the Gu King.</p><p>Sensing the poison pearl's aura, the Gu King's buzzing suddenly ceased.  It turned, its blood-red eyes fixated on the poison pearl as if facing a formidable enemy, then emitted an even more frantic and shrill buzz.</p><p>“A reaction is good…”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. After a moment's thought, he directed the poison pearl through the demonic fire, placing it before the Gu King.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Immediately, a beam of poisonous light shot out.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare be too careless and controlled the poison pearl to dodge slightly, allowing only the edge of the poisonous light to touch it.</p><p>Suddenly, the poison pearl transformed into a mist, and the poisonous light passed straight through.</p><p>Then, the poison pearl reformed, completely unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang checked it and, reassured, guided the poison pearl towards the Gu King.</p><p>The Gu King's wings vibrated frantically, spewing poisonous light. But it couldn't hit Qin Sang nor destroy the poison pearl. Instead, the demonic fire gradually constricted its space, and the poison pearl closed in.</p><p>Soon, the poison pearl floated directly above the Gu King's head.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The poison pearl transformed into a radiant, poison-repelling mist, as if about to swallow the Gu King.</p><p>The next moment, the Gu King was enveloped in the mist. The faint outline of the pearl could still be seen within the mist's form.</p><p>However, after approaching the Gu King to a certain distance, the mist could advance no further. The Gu King spread its wings, its body emitting a faint crimson light, forming a protective poisonous aura, and flashed out of the mist.</p><p>The attempt failed, but Qin Sang's face showed not frustration, but surprise, as if he had discovered something unexpected.</p><p>He continued controlling the poison pearl, repeating the process.</p><p>After dozens of attempts, all ending in failure, the strange look in Qin Sang's eyes intensified. He had made a startling discovery.</p><p>Every time the poison pearl enveloped the Gu King, Qin Sang felt a sensation as if the pearl craved the Gu King, intending to devour it!</p><p>After so many attempts, Qin Sang was certain this sensation wasn't an illusion.</p><p>He remembered that after the Fat Silkworm's fourth transformation, it could directly devour gu insects. He had even bred some for it to feast on.  The Gu King's cultivation method was similar to those gu insects.</p><p>The poison pearl extracted from the Fat Silkworm had inherited this devouring ability!</p><p>“If the poison pearl devours the Gu King, could it continue to improve?”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed at this possibility.</p><p>The poison-repelling divine ability had a limited scope, but when used, it was remarkably effective.</p><p>Qin Sang always believed internal power was superior to external objects.  The poison pearl was closely connected to him, practically a part of him.  If the poison pearl continued to devour poisonous creatures, what kind of transformation would it undergo in the future?</p><p>The Gu King had low intelligence. In terms of potential, it was clearly inferior to the poison pearl.</p><p>The problem was that the poison pearl couldn't suppress the Gu King. How could he make the Gu King willingly submit to being devoured?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, recalling various scriptures and further comprehending the Gu Scripture. Even as his True Essence neared full recovery and it was time to leave, he couldn't come up with a solution.</p><p>Suddenly, inspiration struck. He clapped his hands.</p><p>Since insect control methods weren't working, why not approach it from its master's perspective?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure what methods the strange-faced man used to suppress the Gu King.  But he knew the strange-faced man's core cultivation method was the Wood Emperor Scripture, aligned with the Wood Dao.</p><p>The Gu King, constantly by the strange-faced man's side, might fear this aura.</p><p>However, before having his avatar attempt this, Qin Sang withdrew his mind from his Qi Sea, returning to his original spirit.</p><p>For the first time since integrating Yun Youzi's Scorched Wood True Spirit, the unused Yun You Sword would be unsheathed!</p><p>Light flashed from his brow.</p><p>Azure sword light instantly illuminated the cave!</p><p>“Old friend, it's your turn…”</p><p>Qin Sang, filled with both excitement and a tinge of melancholy, pointed at the Gu King.</p><p>The Yun You Sword, infused with ten divine woods, was a supreme Wood-type treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't using the Yun You Sword to kill the Gu King, so he didn't worry about damaging the true spirit. Instead, he catalyzed the sword intent, using the pure Wood-type treasure fused with powerful sword intent to suppress the Gu King.</p><p>If successful, he would retract the poison pearl, the Gu King, and the Yun You Sword into his body, maintaining this state until the poison pearl devoured the Gu King!</p>
