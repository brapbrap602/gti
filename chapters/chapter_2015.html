<h1>Chapter 2006: Fengju Yumen</h1><p>“Sword Slave?”</p><p>After leaving the Talisman World, Qin Sang had lost contact with all his old acquaintances there.  He hadn't expected the first one he encountered would be Sword Slave.</p><p>Tian Yue Shangren had dispatched Sword Slave to wait for him in Bai Yu Jing. He wondered what instructions awaited him.</p><p>With contact re-established with Tian Yue Shangren, reaching First Sword Attendant and the Dao Court would be much easier. This saved him from wandering around like a headless fly.</p><p>“This is not a suitable place for conversation.  True Man, please follow me,” Sword Slave said, activating his movement technique and flying towards Bai Yu Jing.</p><p>Bai Yu Jing's Thirty-Three Heavenly Palaces, with their countless golden halls standing shoulder to shoulder, denoted rank by height. The higher the level, the more noble the status. King Zhou resided on the highest, the Thirty-Third Heavenly Palace.</p><p>However, King Zhou's demise had caused Qin Sang to question his cultivation level. The hierarchy within Bai Yu Jing might not adhere to the cultivation world's common understanding of strength determining status.</p><p>“After Master brought me to Bai Yu Jing, I cultivated while seeking opportunities.  Eventually, I became a Golden Guard of King Zhou and now reside on the Twenty-Ninth Level, awaiting summons at any time," Sword Slave explained, yet he led Qin Sang towards the lowest level. His current residence was too close to King Zhou's palace, making it unsafe.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang had assumed it was Tian Yue Shangren’s or the Dao Court’s arrangement, but he hadn’t expected it to be Sword Slave’s own doing. Were the King Zhou's Golden Guards so easy to join?</p><p>“The members of the Golden Guard are originally sent in by various factions. They also regularly hold selections in the Eight Heavenly Continents. I relied on the swordsmanship Master taught me to compete for a position,” Sword Slave explained.</p><p>Sword Slave’s current cultivation had reached the peak of the Nascent Soul stage, just a step away from Soul Formation.</p><p>He remembered that Sword Slave was still in the late Nascent Soul stage when they parted.  His progress over these five hundred years had been astonishing, a true testament to accumulated effort.</p><p>If not for experiencing various fortuitous encounters, Qin Sang couldn't guarantee that his current cultivation could match Sword Slave's.</p><p>Tian Yue Shangren and Sword Slave were master and servant in name, but they had a teacher-disciple relationship. To be chosen by Tian Yue Shangren, Sword Slave's talent must be exceptional. After diligently honing his cultivation, his hopes of breaking through to Soul Formation were high.</p><p>“The Golden Guards are all spies sent by various forces.  King Zhou truly has no freedom,” Qin Sang looked up at the Thirty-Three Heavenly Palaces of King Zhou and thought to himself.</p><p>As a Golden Guard, Sword Slave moved freely within Bai Yu Jing.  He brought Qin Sang to a secluded courtyard, activated the restrictive formations, and meticulously completed the customary rituals.</p><p>“Meeting an old friend in this vast world is a joyous occasion. Fellow Daoist, why adhere to these formalities? It creates unnecessary distance. I believe Senior Tian Yue wouldn’t interfere with the camaraderie between us," Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>“Etiquette cannot be neglected. I cannot bring shame upon Master,” Sword Slave said resolutely.</p><p>Was this unyielding temperament what made one suitable to be a sword cultivator?  Qin Sang was helpless and could only let him be.</p><p>The courtyard was small, with a stone table and stools in the center.  The two sat facing each other.</p><p>Having waited for centuries, a little more time wouldn't hurt.  As they sipped tea and conversed, Qin Sang wasn’t in a hurry to ask any questions, using a casual tone to recount his experiences over the years.</p><p>“I was sent into the Great Thousand World and landed in the South Sea, beyond the Great Zhou territory. Fortunately, it was also a human territory, so I didn't encounter any danger. These years, I've been busy stabilizing my cultivation, honing my divine abilities, and preparing myself before setting off. I didn't expect Fellow Daoist to have been waiting for me all this time. I apologize for making you wait.”</p><p>“Back then, during the demonic chaos, Master ordered me to travel north to hunt down the culprits. I used this opportunity to break through to Nascent Soul.  Master brought me into the Great Thousand World and guided my swordsmanship for a period before ordering me to come to Bai Yu Jing…”</p><p>Sword Slave’s subsequent experiences weren’t particularly noteworthy.  For fear of missing Qin Sang, he had barely left Bai Yu Jing.</p><p>“Do you know where Senior Tian Yue and the Dao Court are now?” This was what Qin Sang was most concerned about.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Sword Slave shook his head slightly. “I don't know.  Master brought me here and has never appeared since.”</p><p>Compared to himself, Tian Yue Shangren seemed more like a descendant of the Sword Pavilion.</p><p>Having not appeared for so long, could he be carrying out some grand plan under the orders of First Sword Attendant?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, then pressed further, “Is there no news of the Dao Court? Its return to the Great Thousand World has already spread, hasn't it?”</p><p>Bai Yu Jing was the center of the human race, the place with the most information in the Great Thousand World.</p><p>“I have indeed heard many rumors. The Dao Court has returned to the Great Thousand World and established the Myriad Dharma Altar, marking the reappearance of the Daoist Talisman lineage.  But regarding the location of the Myriad Dharma Altar, there are many conflicting accounts. Some say it has already been obtained by a major power, others claim it's outside the Eight Heavenly Continents, in the Western Buddhist Lands, or even within the territories of the Witch Clan, Demon Clan, or other foreign races. There are even rumors of it being hidden in the deep sea wilderness… There’s no definitive answer.”</p><p>A strange glint flashed in Sword Slave's eyes. He had followed Tian Yue Shangren in the Talisman World and came from a Daoist lineage himself.  Despite knowing that the Dao Court had returned to the Great Thousand World, he didn't know the location of his homeland.</p><p>Qin Sang knew in his heart that the Dao Court’s secrecy was the right choice.</p><p>Even if the enemies who had destroyed the Dao Court and defeated the Divine Court were gone, the Divine Court itself was a supreme Daoist talisman treasure, bound to attract the covetous eyes of powerful beings.</p><p>Now, the human race in the Great Thousand World was ruled by King Zhou, and the Eight Heavenly Continents were rife with powerful factions. The situation was certainly different from when the Dao Court existed. Times had changed, and it might not be possible to gather the forces that had once besieged the Dao Court. Perhaps some could even become allies of the Dao Court.</p><p>Qin Sang’s standing wasn't high enough to see through these intricacies.  He guessed that at least one true Grand Ascension cultivator would need to appear before the Dao Court gradually made contact with the Great Thousand World.</p><p>It wouldn't be difficult for the Dao Court to remain hidden.</p><p>Even the Ji Tian Sect could control the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven.  Those top powers controlled countless Small Thousand Worlds, and there were certainly Small Thousand Worlds with more complete and wondrous Heavenly Daos, even approaching the Great Thousand World.</p><p>The Grand Ascension cultivator slain by Celestial Master Zhang and First Sword Attendant might have had a cultivation sanctuary that was a grotto-heaven.</p><p>If the Dao Court established the Divine Court within a normal Small Thousand World and sealed the Dao Marker Gate to recuperate, who could find them if they didn't emerge?</p><p>It seemed that he wouldn’t see Tian Yue Shangren and the Dao Court anytime soon. Qin Sang rubbed his fingers against the warm teacup.  “Senior Tian Yue asked Fellow Daoist to wait for me here.  What are the arrangements for what’s next?”</p><p>Sword Slave’s expression turned serious.  “Master commanded that upon seeing True Man, I should direct you to the Zi Wei Palace to retrieve a sword!”</p><p>He didn’t know which sword specifically, but Qin Sang knew perfectly well.</p><p>The Earth Slaughter Sword fragment!</p><p>The Zi Wei Sword Canon!</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly straightened his back and asked in a deep voice, “Did Senior find the Zi Wei Palace?”</p><p>The Earth Slaughter Sword fragment was hidden within one of the Fourteen Sword Pavilions of the Zi Wei Palace. To obtain the fragment, one must first find the Zi Wei Palace.</p><p>Back then, the Zi Wei Palace was summoned from the Storm Realm to the Upper Realm, its whereabouts unknown since.  Qin Sang had planned to settle down in Bai Yu Jing, hoping it would be easier to inquire about the Zi Wei Palace here.</p><p>Sword Slave nodded slightly, subconsciously lowering his voice to explain the reason.  Qin Sang finally learned the full story.</p><p>As he had suspected, it was indeed someone from the Great Thousand World who had summoned the Zi Wei Palace back then, causing it to ascend through the realms.</p><p>First Sword Attendant was traversing the River of Misfortune at the time. Sensing the fluctuation, he was too late to stop it, and could only act hastily to prevent the Zi Wei Palace’s return.  He struck the Zi Wei Palace, sending it into an Ancient Battlefield, using the residual power left behind by the battles of ancient mighty figures to conceal it, disrupting the other party's plan to recall the Zi Wei Palace.</p><p>However, First Sword Attendant was affected by the Six Heavens’ Ancient Qi at the time, and the space within the River of Misfortune was chaotic.  He wasn't sure which Ancient Battlefield the Zi Wei Palace had fallen into.  Tian Yue Shangren, upon returning to the Great Thousand World, searched and finally pinpointed its specific location.</p><p>“Where is the Ancient Battlefield?”</p><p>Qin Sang was all too familiar with Ancient Battlefields. The Storm Realm had them, the Talisman World had them, and the Great Thousand World also had them.</p><p>“Master has confirmed it's west of Dui Continent, at Fengju Yumen!” Sword Slave said.</p><p>Dui Continent was one of the Eight Heavenly Continents, said to be northwest of Bai Yu Jing.</p><p>Fengju Yumen, the name was unique, and Qin Sang had heard it for the first time.</p><p>“Fengju Yumen was once a sacred mountain of the ancient Witch Clan. They believed it to be the mountain where the sun and moon set.  Later, during the great war between the ancient races, the sacred mountain collapsed, transforming into an Ancient Battlefield.  Within these Ancient Battlefields, the divine abilities left by ancient mighty figures remain undiminished for eons.  There are also shattered grotto-heavens and Small Thousand Worlds, with chaotic Heavenly Daos. They remain the most dangerous places in the Great Thousand World even today,” Sword Slave explained.</p><p>“As Master confirmed the Zi Wei Palace’s location at Fengju Yumen, some factions have also become aware of it.  Undercurrents are stirring within Fengju Yumen, and some fragments have already been unearthed.</p><p>“The true Zi Wei Palace has not yet emerged, but people are persistently searching for it, and its location will be exposed sooner or later.</p><p>“Master doesn't dare open it rashly, otherwise, it will immediately attract powerful figures, leaving no opportunity to retrieve the spiritual sword.</p><p>“Only True Man can sense the location of the spiritual sword. At that time, Master will personally go to Fengju Yumen and use the Zi Wei Palace to attract the attention of all factions.  True Man will secretly retrieve the spiritual sword and must immediately flee without any hesitation. When the time is right, Master will come to see you.”</p><p>“Hiss!”  Qin Sang gasped.</p><p>Tian Yue Shangren intended to draw all eyes to himself, allowing Qin Sang to remain hidden in the shadows.</p><p>The Zi Wei Palace was the enemy of the world, and First Sword Attendant was in closed-door cultivation to heal his injuries.</p><p>From this point on, Tian Yue Shangren would be plunged into a vortex of life and death, facing the entire Great Thousand World alone with his sword!</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t know how dire the situation was that it required Tian Yue Shangren to be so resolute.</p><p>Although Tian Yue Shangren valued the Earth Slaughter Sword and Qin Sang’s identity as the "descendant" of the Zi Wei Sword Sovereign more, Qin Sang couldn't deny that he was the biggest beneficiary, and the price was Tian Yue Shangren putting himself in danger.</p><p>Even First Sword Attendant needed to conceal his identity.  What kind of danger would he, with only Soul Formation cultivation, face?  Could he truly accomplish this?</p><p>Silent for a long while, Qin Sang sighed inwardly and asked, "Will Fellow Daoist accompany me?"</p><p>“Now that I have news of True Man, I must inform Master. I’m unsure how Master will arrange for me."</p><p>Sword Slave continued, "True Man’s arrival is timely. King Zhou’s demise has caused a huge uproar within the human race. The attention of all factions, and even foreign races, is focused here. They will soon convene to discuss King Zhou’s lifespan, and the pressure on Fengju Yumen will lessen somewhat.”</p><p>“No wonder King Zhou passed away months ago, but Gen Continent hasn’t reacted at all. It seems like they’ve been keeping the secret of his death.  Was King Zhou’s lifespan restricted before?” Qin Sang suddenly realized.</p><p>Sword Slave nodded.  “After the Jade Emperor, no successive King Zhou could surpass Nascent Soul, thus being limited by lifespan. Legend says that powerful figures reached a consensus and established a law.  King Zhou, enjoying all the worldly glory, could not further occupy destiny! Now, rumors are rampant within Bai Yu Jing, and the next King Zhou has yet to be established.  All factions are debating whether to break or loosen this restriction.”</p><p>Breaking the lifespan restriction… If a truly gifted King Zhou appeared, reaching Soul Formation or even Grand Ascension, wouldn’t he become a living Jade Emperor, a true king?</p><p>How could other factions accept this?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t understand how this issue had become a point of contention.</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Suddenly, a thought struck Qin Sang. He considered a possibility: "The Great Vehicle and Small Vehicle debate?"</p><p>The Great Vehicle aimed to ferry all beings across the sea of suffering. Regardless of the path – Divine Dao, Kingly Dao, Sage Dao, etc. – utilizing royal authority was undoubtedly easier to achieve this.</p><p>King Zhou occupied righteousness and was irreplaceable.</p><p>In the cultivation world, a mere two or three thousand years was hardly enough to form a grand momentum.  Promoting a true King Zhou and implementing policies in his name to reform the world, with all of humanity obeying his laws, would undoubtedly be greatly beneficial to the propagation of the Great Vehicle Dao.</p><p>This was a contention of the Dao!</p><p>It wasn’t difficult to imagine who the opposing sides of this debate were.</p><p>Although the Zi Wei Palace was the Zi Wei Sword Sovereign’s sanctuary, in the eyes of some powerful figures, it was perhaps less important than the Dao contention.</p><p>Sword Slave nodded.  “The debate has existed for a long time, and with King Zhou’s passing, it has reached its peak.”</p><p>“Those carefree Grand Ascension cultivators and major sects will certainly not stand idly by…”</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang truly felt as if he was experiencing a world-altering change, caught in the currents of history.</p><p>This debate wasn’t limited to the human race; it was about paving the Dao for all beings in the Great Thousand World.</p><p>Countless years later, the Great Vehicle and Small Vehicle debate would surely leave a significant mark in the history books of the Great Thousand World, just like every world-altering event of the ancient era.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of excitement, but he also deeply understood the danger involved. It could very well be the beginning of an epoch-making war. “Fellow Daoist, being in Bai Yu Jing, you must have seen many ancient texts. How much do you know about ancient history?”</p><p>He knew that only by understanding the history of the Great Thousand World could he deduce the underlying currents, find the truth, and determine his own stance. Otherwise, he would remain perpetually ignorant and manipulated.</p><p>Unfortunately, after countless years, history had become blurred and even rewritten.</p><p>The texts available for purchase were mixed with legends and couldn't be trusted. True ancient texts were only collected by ancient lineages, top sects, and powerful aristocratic families, and they were rarely shown to outsiders.</p><p>“Even as a Golden Guard of King Zhou, the ancient texts I have access to are extremely limited.  Master, when in the mood, would discuss ancient and modern times, and I did hear some things.</p><p>“In ancient times, myriad races thrived, and humanity was just one of them.</p><p>“The so-called myriad races of antiquity, after the rise of humanity, were almost all categorized as ‘demons’ by humans, who considered themselves the most intelligent of all beings.</p><p>“But in ancient times, the Demon Clan flourished, with the Ancient Demon Court ruling the Great Thousand World. The Witch Clan harbored ulterior motives, and there were even foreign demons from beyond the realms who breached the barrier and invaded the Great Thousand World…</p><p>“In that most chaotic era, the Jade Emperor led humanity to shatter the Demon Court, subdue the Witch Clan, and drive out the foreign demons, sealing the barrier between realms. The Ancient Battlefield of Fengju Yumen was a remnant of that time. The Witch Clan was driven beyond Fengju Yumen and has been unable to cross it since.</p><p>“It’s said the Jade Emperor intended to establish a Heavenly Court of the Human Dao.  It's unknown what truly happened then, leaving only Bai Yu Jing and the Eight Heavenly Continents.  The barrier wasn't completely sealed, laying the groundwork for future unrest.</p><p>“Humanity appears prosperous, but in reality, there are external threats from foreign races, internal disagreements between the Great Vehicle and Small Vehicle, the Buddhist Western Lands governing themselves independently, the Eight Heavenly Continents and various Dao lineages acting on their own, and foreign demons coveting the Great Thousand World.  There are hidden dangers everywhere…”</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Entering the final arc of this volume. Taking a day off to organize the outline.</p>
