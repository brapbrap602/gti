<h1>Chapter 2081: The Demon Cultivator</h1><p>The Central Plains, vast and boundless, is large enough to accommodate humans, demons, and witches.</p><p>For now, the three races haven't clashed over territory, each recuperating within their own domains, boundaries clearly defined.</p><p>The Demon Sea's territory borders the Western Wasteland, situated by the South Sea.  Squads of demon soldiers patrol back and forth on clouds, forming a tight defense, creating a chilling atmosphere.</p><p>Over a certain part of the sea, shortly after a squad of demon soldiers flew by, the sea suddenly churned. With a whoosh, waves splashed, and a full-grown shark surfaced, its mouth agape, revealing a mouthful of sharp teeth.</p><p>The shark ejected a jet of water, within which was a whale.  This whale was smaller than even a typical young whale.</p><p>After expelling the whale, the shark’s body stiffened, its eyes rapidly clouded over with a film of white, its belly flipped, and it drifted away with the current, already dead.</p><p>The small whale swam into the sea, its eyes bright and intelligent, clearly not an ordinary beast.</p><p>The nearby demon soldiers noticed nothing unusual.  The small whale oriented itself, silently swam for a while, and arrived beside an island, sticking its head out of the water. A ball of blue light floated from its mouth; a pearl was faintly visible in its throat.</p><p>The blue light separated from its body, flickered once, and transformed into a pool of clear water. The small whale immediately closed its mouth and dived beneath the surface.</p><p>The pool of water undulated in mid-air, first growing limbs and a head, then hands, feet, and facial features, transforming into a water duplicate of the Dragon Whale King, though slightly shorter.</p><p>The water duplicate materialized, blinked, and instantly came to life, its aura changing dramatically, exuding the same imposing presence as the Dragon Whale King. It abruptly raised its head, looking toward the top of the island. Its gaze, sharp as two swords, met two other gazes in the air.</p><p>At the top of the island, tall grass surrounded a large rock. A tall, imposing man stood on the rock, clad in dragon robes, with a valiant bearing—the Jiao Dragon King.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King had witnessed the entire transformation. Seeing the Dragon Whale King's water duplicate looking at him, he nodded slightly, offering a friendly smile.</p><p>The water duplicate took a step forward, and in the next instant, it appeared at the edge of the rock.</p><p>"What brings you here, friend?"</p><p>The water duplicate spoke in the Dragon Whale King's voice, though slightly muffled.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King sized it up. This was his first contact with the water duplicate; he wasn't sure if the Dragon Whale King was controlling it directly from the East Sea, conversing remotely.</p><p>"King Golden Toad said that you, Dragon Whale, have made great progress in your cultivation, soon to reach the late Nascent Soul stage?" The Jiao Dragon King curiously asked.</p><p>"This water duplicate can only maintain its form for a hundred breaths," the water duplicate replied flatly, evading the question.</p><p>This was a clear indication to stop wasting time.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King wasn't annoyed. He continued, "King Golden Toad mentioned the protective formation of Qingyang Temple. I investigated it before Qingyang Temple closed its gates, and King Golden Toad's words were not exaggerated."</p><p>The water duplicate uttered a sound of acknowledgement.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King didn't dwell on this, changing the subject. He asked in a low voice, "Once you reach the late Nascent Soul stage, what are your plans?"</p><p>The water duplicate stared at the Jiao Dragon King, silent.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King smiled, his expression darkening.</p><p>"For years, we have suffered countless casualties fighting the Changyou Clan. Our contributions are no less than the humans', yet we are consistently suppressed by them.</p><p>"The humans are deceitful. They only allied with us to fight external enemies. But the allocation of Qingling Qi always depends on their whims. Thankfully, our race has innate talent; otherwise, even if we expel the Changyou Clan, we will be forever suppressed by the humans.</p><p>"Before, our clan was weak and could only hide and endure. Once you and I both reach the late Nascent Soul stage, the balance of power will shift. It's time for a change; surely you won't continue to endure?"</p><p>His tone was subtly persuasive as he observed the water duplicate, but it showed no change in expression.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King smirked, "Are you reluctant to overthrow that ice beauty? Her lover drained my Dragon Transformation Pond, otherwise I wouldn't have been so severely injured and almost died under the Heavenly Tribulation. If you could take her, you'd also help me get revenge. But don't fall for her charms, haha…"</p><p>The provocation was ineffective against the Dragon Whale King. The water duplicate calmly said, "The Changyou Clan also has several skilled individuals."</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King stopped laughing, understanding the Dragon Whale King's implication.</p><p>The decline of human power stemmed from their dwindling legacy, while the Changyou Clan possessed both a legacy and powerful techniques.  In the last battle, several individuals showcased impressive cultivation.</p><p>Not only were their own strengths improving, but their enemies were also getting stronger.</p><p>Even if the Changyou tribe produces one or more late-stage Divine Transformation experts, their breakthrough won't change the Storm Realm's situation. Now is not the time for internal strife.</p><p>"I don't intend to annihilate the human race.  My clan is powerful; the Storm Realm should be led by us, and we should control the distribution of Qingling energy. Of course, provoking the Ice Beauty and the Changyou leader into a fight to the death would be most beneficial to my clan."</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King paused, observing the Dragon Whale King's reaction.  He continued, "Those of different races will always have different hearts! Even if we subdue the Changyou, the three races can't coexist peacefully. We are all of the same race, much more trustworthy than outsiders. Why not unite the East Sea and the Demon Sea?"</p><p>The Dragon Whale King remained noncommittal, asking, "Have you consulted the Feather King?"</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King sneered, "That fellow supports some sect called the Yuling Sect, cozying up to the humans, seemingly content with it. However, his stronghold is deep in the North Sea, near the Xuan Tian Palace and the Qingyang Temple ancestral grounds. His true intentions may be different. I'll try to probe him."</p><p>The Water Spirit incarnation nodded, finally responding directly, "I haven't broken through yet. It's too early to think about these things."</p><p>This wasn't the answer the Jiao Dragon King wanted. He frowned. "Why don't you hear my plan first? I have a like-minded friend. Would you like to meet him?"</p><p>"No need! If you have nothing else, I'll take my leave."</p><p>The Water Spirit incarnation flatly refused, melting like a candle, about to become a puddle of water.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King's expression shifted. He said repeatedly, "I'm not forcing you to make a decision immediately. However, you should at least promise me neutrality."</p><p>"I need to close myself off to break through..."</p><p>The Water Spirit incarnation left behind a single sentence before completely melting away.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King's brow relaxed slightly. "The Qingyang Temple's high-minded words are merely a pretext for rebuilding their sect, yet they dare demand everyone's cooperation! Since they disregarded the greater good first, next time the three races meet, I intend to ask the human race to help us reclaim our ancestral lands. I hope you will support us."</p><p>There was no response; only a water stain remained on the rock.</p><p>At that moment, a ball of green ghost fire floated from the bushes beside the rock, rising above it. The flame flickered, and a hazy figure emerged.</p><p>The figure was ghostly, surrounded by ghost fire, pale-faced, lifeless, exuding a strong chilling aura even under the scorching sun.</p><p>The ghost looked at the water stain on the ground, worriedly asking, "The Dragon Whale King refused?"</p><p>"He didn't agree, but he didn't refuse either."</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King sneered, "That fellow will always side with the victor. As long as we gain the upper hand, he'll come crawling to us."</p><p>Upon hearing this, the ghost's expression eased slightly, but doubts still lingered. He had assumed this was a conflict between two races, and the Dragon Whale King would definitely agree to join forces with the Jiao Dragon King.</p><p>What is the Dragon Whale King thinking!</p><p>If all the demon clans attack together, the human race will have to make huge concessions to avoid internal division.</p><p>However, if only the Demon Sea demon clans are involved, their strength is considerably weakened and their plan might encounter unforeseen difficulties.</p><p>In fact, the Jiao Dragon King wasn't as confident as he sounded.  Beneath the Dragon Whale King's rough exterior and domineering demeanor lay an incredibly deep mind; until the very end, no one could fathom his thoughts.</p><p>But the overthrow of the human race would benefit all demon clans, and the Jiao Dragon King couldn't think of a reason for the Dragon Whale King to betray them.</p><p>He lifted his eyes, looking at the ghost, saying, "Next, it depends on Daoist Hong."</p><p>The ghost bowed slightly, "Jiao Dragon King, rest assured. Hong will not let you down."</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King stared into the ghost's eyes, giving a cold smile. "I naturally trust Daoist Hong, but I haven't met many of your subordinates. I don't know if their backgrounds are truly clean, or if they are truly ruthless."</p><p>The ghost's expression became serious. "Hong understands the gravity of this matter and has personally investigated the background of each person. Their backgrounds are absolutely clean. As for ruthlessness, the Jiao Dragon King need not worry. These people were all powerful figures in the demonic path, just like me, having slaughtered countless people. Their hearts are only set on the Dao. Even if millions die before them, they won't blink an eye. As long as it benefits their cultivation, they are willing to do anything!"</p><p>"Good."</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King stood with his hands behind his back, gazing at the Central Plains. "Daoist Hong should know that once we start, we cannot turn back. And you have no way out!"</p><p>"Humph! Even though we are demonic cultivators, we can fight and make contributions! When they distributed the Qingling energy, they excluded us!"</p><p>Hate flashed across the ghost's face.  "Luckily, Heaven had eyes and allowed Hong to reach the Divine Transformation realm. Since they were unrighteous, don't blame me for being unrighteous!"</p><p>Demonic cultivators also have different levels. Some practice demonic arts, some refuse to be bound by rules, and others are truly evil, devoid of kindness.</p><p>Among the most notorious were those lawless cultivators who, unburdened by conscience or restraint, practiced the most evil magic, readily resorting to blood sacrifices.  These demonic cultivators were uncontrollable; if something benefited them, they would do it, regardless of the consequences.  Even sects like the Tian Hao Tower refused to associate with them.  Yet, they consistently managed to seize the greatest gains, rising to become powerful figures in the demonic world.</p><p>Allowing these cultivators to gain power would mean no protection for the Storm Realm.  In times of crisis, they would flee faster than anyone else.  The Storm Realm wasn't yet in such dire straits as to compromise with such individuals.  Giving them access to the Azure Spirit Qi was out of the question; it was even purged to prevent sabotage during any future battles.</p><p>These demonic cultivators were forced into hiding, enduring and biding their time, afraid to cause trouble.  However, with the resurgence of spiritual energy, some, whether naturally gifted or blessed by extraordinary opportunities, managed to ascend to the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>The large-scale battles left countless corpses and rivers of blood—a sight these demonic cultivators relished.  Gui Ying was one such cultivator. He had gathered around him a group of wronged demonic cultivators, forming a considerable force.</p><p>The allure of the Azure Spirit Qi was too strong; they were unwilling to remain in the shadows. They considered defecting to the Changyou tribe, but realized that when the nest falls, the eggs break. The Changyou tribe's intent to exterminate all opposition meant that once the Storm Realm fell, they would be useless, so they hesitated.</p><p>However, they soon made contact with the Jiao Long King, who offered them a place.  They decided to join him.</p><p>“Azure Spirit Qi, you say?” the Jiao Long King asked abruptly.  “Hong Dao you, are you not afraid I’ll turn on you?”</p><p>Gui Ying’s expression remained unchanged. “As long as humanity endures, the Jiao Long King will need us.  Once your Majesty’s power grows, and you successively conquer the Changyou tribe, humanity, and the demon beasts, we will take some Azure Spirit Qi and leave. When you rule the world, surely you won’t begrudge us a little?”</p><p>“Haha…” The Jiao Long King roared with laughter, his eyes flashing. “The Dragon Whale Saint King is right. It’s too early to think of that now.  Hong Dao you, you may return and prepare.  Await my good news!”</p><p>Gui Ying bowed deeply. “This subordinate takes his leave!”</p><p>With that, Gui Ying vanished into the ghostfire; with a ‘pop’, the ghostfire exploded, leaving no trace.  The Jiao Long King remained for a long while before leaving.</p><p>The sea breeze dried the moisture from the rocks, and the island returned to its quiet state.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Thanks to Qin Sang’s tailored plan for Qingyang Temple, the expansion of the mountain gate progressed smoothly.  The entire temple worked together, transforming the landscape. Several peaks and rivers had even been relocated.  The breathtaking scenery already hinted at the grandeur of a future great sect.</p><p>Underneath, the temple was channeling spiritual veins, converging them towards the chosen main peak, gradually forming a pattern resembling a hundred rivers flowing into the sea.  Seeing their mountain gate improve under their hands filled the disciples with pride.</p><p>Anyone entering at this time might glimpse secrets of the protective mountain array, so Li Yu Fu recently announced the closure of the temple, refusing visitors. Other sects wisely refrained from disturbing them.</p><p>Having received too many visitors, Li Yu Fu worried about revealing flaws. Exhausted, he finally enjoyed some peace, but it wasn’t exactly restful; all Qingyang Temple matters still fell to him.</p><p>“Senior Brother.”</p><p>Shen Chen’s voice came from outside the palace.</p><p>Li Yu Fu opened the door, letting Shen Chen in.  “Junior Brother, another batch of spirit flags completed?”</p><p>Shen Chen nodded, placing a storage pouch down.  “All the spirit flags are here. We can select disciples to begin refining them.”</p><p>Noticing Li Yu Fu’s serious expression, he asked, “Senior Brother, what concerns you? Are you afraid of opposition?  Has the Changyou tribe made another move?”</p><p>The tripartite council was approaching; Li Yu Fu had already spread word that this meeting would decide the matter.</p><p>Li Yu Fu’s brow smoothed. “It’s not that, brother.  Our proactive withdrawal of forces is exactly what they desire, so why would they object?  But these individuals are all shrewd; I must be careful with my every word and action, rehearsing them in my mind beforehand.”</p>
