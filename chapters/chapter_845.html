<h1>Chapter 837: Siege</h1><p>Chapter 837: Siege</p><p>“The island masters had an agreement. We've been trapped for so long, others should have noticed something's wrong and sent reinforcements. Yet, there's no news…  Something must have happened outside.  The island master senses danger. If things turn for the worse, we'll abandon the island…”</p><p>Jin Ying received detailed information from the Merchant Alliance; all major forces were scrambling to make arrangements.</p><p>“The island master poured a lot of effort into building this array. Yu Heng Island's protective array isn't just for defense; it can easily be transformed into a pure killing array, incredibly powerful. Unfortunately, once transformed, the spirit array can only be used once, unleashing its final brilliance. When the island master activates the array to annihilate the demonic beasts, that's our best chance to break out…”</p><p>Jin Ying invited Qin Sang to break out with them. After a moment's thought, Qin Sang only said she would try to rendezvous with them.</p><p>After all, no one could predict the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang, having sent the two women off, sat cross-legged in her cave dwelling, lost in thought.</p><p>She wondered how powerful the protective array was. Ideally, it would wipe out the demonic beasts in one fell swoop, allowing for an immediate escape.</p><p>More likely, a fierce battle would ensue.  Going with the Merchant Alliance's experts meant having strong backup, but also being a bigger target, easily attracting powerful demons.</p><p>After cultivating the "Heavenly Demon Transformation," Qin Sang had an idea, one she might be able to test this time.</p><p>For the next few days, everything proceeded as usual. During routine patrols and vigilance, Qin Sang observed and found the demonic beasts were indeed more active than before.</p><p>Days turned into weeks.  They maintained contact, with Jin Ying frequently sending updates, the situation showing no improvement.</p><p>After two weeks, the cultivators were awakened in the dead of night.  Bursting from their caves, they saw dark clouds pressing down from the sky.</p><p>Anger, fear, determination, despair…</p><p>Various expressions appeared on the cultivators' faces.</p><p>On Yu Heng Island, demonic roars echoed like thunder, yet the deep sound of the warning bells remained clear.</p><p>Suddenly, dawn broke.</p><p>A gigantic protective dome appeared, covering the entire city and the surrounding area.</p><p>The protective array had been activated!</p><p>The array couldn't cover the entire island; the outer areas were abandoned, everyone retreating into the city. The verdant mountains were quickly overrun by a sea of demonic beasts.  The cultivators felt the ground tremble violently beneath their feet, mirroring their pounding hearts.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The first collision occurred. A demonic beast slammed into the dome, instantly annihilated by the array's power, its body disintegrating, blood raining down from the sky.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, clumps of flesh exploded, splattering the dome, staining it crimson, turning it into a horrifying blood-red shield.</p><p>Apart from the roaring and the demonic howls, they could hear nothing else. The dome pulsed with powerful spiritual energy.  As soon as one beast was destroyed, another took its place, endlessly.</p><p>Despite its seemingly thin appearance, the dome proved extraordinarily resilient under the onslaught.</p><p>Without needing any prompting, the lower-level cultivators in the city spontaneously summoned their magic weapons, soaring into the sky, unleashing beams of light to slay the beasts outside the dome.</p><p>The dome blazed, the magic weapons and treasures emitting multicolored light, like stars.</p><p>Under the array's protection, the cultivators, free from immediate danger, fought with all their might.</p><p>Qin Sang, on patrol, was the first to detect the demonic beasts' unusual activity.</p><p>The island was prepared for a beast tide; Qin Sang had a mission.  With a command, she led her team towards the ground, where they jointly activated an array disc to assist the island master in maintaining the array.</p><p>Qin Sang was tasked with guarding a section of the array—a heavy responsibility.</p><p>She dared not be negligent. Any lapse could result in the beast tide tearing a hole in the defenses, and they would be the first to be attacked.</p><p>The array disc hovered above them, resonating with the main array and other discs, strengthening the dome and building a solid defense.</p><p>Initially, they faced only minor demons; the scale of the attack was impressive but the pressure was manageable for now. Qin Sang made appropriate arrangements, instructing her subordinates to regulate their breathing, preparing for the most perilous moment.</p><p>Meanwhile, some of the city's guards were securing other sections of the array, like Qin Sang.  Others were busy actively attacking, slaying demonic beasts, though it felt like a drop in the bucket in such a battle.</p><p>Their fates were intertwined.</p><p>Everyone understood this.</p><p>However, they soon faced resistance; demonic beasts at the Core Formation stage pressed their attack.</p><p>These demons possessed thick hides and tough bodies, capable of engaging magic weapons in close combat and withstanding their attacks directly.  They blocked the cultivators' experts, allowing the lesser demons to assault the dome, creating a stalemate.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, observing the shifting formations and the movements of the demonic beasts.  His gaze occasionally drifted towards a large complex of buildings in the north. Jin Ying had informed him that the Merchant Guild members were gathered there, preparing to break out from the island.  He should have time to rendezvous with them during the evacuation.</p><p>…</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, while he wielded his ebony sword, wreaking havoc, several figures moved among the beasts near the protective barrier.  They largely refrained from attacking, instead observing and sensing auras.  Ultimately, they found nothing.</p><p>"We didn't sense that person's aura, nor did we see any similar artifacts," one demon reported to the others. "That person is either hiding, or maintaining the barrier, their aura concealed by the array. Unless they make a move, it'll be difficult to detect them."</p><p>"They must be maintaining the barrier!" another demon concluded.</p><p>A leopard demon, pacing impatiently atop a hill overlooking the city, growled, "That person's cultivation is not weak. We can't afford to ignore them. It seems we can only find them after breaking the barrier. Keep attacking! Once the barrier is down, let's see where they can hide!  And don't forget, they had a companion. Finding her will do just as well!"</p><p>Resolute in his determination, the leopard demon ordered a relentless assault on the barrier, commanding his subordinates to attack in waves until it broke.  The demons, burdened with apprehension, obeyed.</p><p>…</p><p>Awakening from meditation, Qin Sang looked down at his hands. The two mid-grade spirit stones in his palms had turned pale, their spiritual energy depleted. He crushed them into powder, letting the dust sift through his fingers.</p><p>He looked back towards the barrier, where the demonic tide still raged, obscuring the sky.</p><p>"Five days," he murmured, calculating the time.</p><p>For five full days, the corpses of the beasts had piled high, the ground awash with blood, yet the tide showed no sign of abating.  Being on the front lines, he sensed the subtle organization beneath the apparent chaos – a powerful demon was surely orchestrating this.</p><p>The atmosphere in the city grew increasingly heavy.  The people sensed the unusual nature of this assault and were deeply worried; those in the know, like Qin Sang, were even more anxious.  Cut off from the outside world, with no reinforcements in sight, hope was dwindling. The fate of Yu Heng Island rested solely on the island master's decision.</p><p>(This chapter is a repost of yesterday's.)</p>
