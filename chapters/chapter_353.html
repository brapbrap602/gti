<h1>Chapter 346: The Boundless Valley</h1><p>Chapter 346: The Boundless Valley</p><p>“This person is extremely strange. He dwells in a gloomy and dark place within the Boundless Valley, wandering like a ghost, for an unknown period of time.  He has a human form, seems to retain some consciousness, and possesses considerable strength.  Even stranger, he’s adept at escape techniques, appearing and disappearing without a trace, and can use incantations, yet he doesn't seem quite alive…”</p><p>Yun Youzi carefully recounted what he knew about the strange man, his voice laced with doubt.  “I initially thought he might have been caught in some strange restriction within the Boundless Valley, only to discover that the energy fluctuations in Tan Jie's aura bear some resemblance to this strange person…”</p><p>Qin Sang, the more he listened, the more convinced he became that this person was a reanimated corpse.</p><p>Moreover, based on Yun Youzi's description, this reanimated corpse was exceptionally strong; even if not a Sky-Soaring Night Rakshasa, it must have been created using a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Could it be that some expert from the Heavenly Corpse Sect met with an accident, leaving their reanimated corpse trapped in the Boundless Valley?</p><p>The Boundless Valley, situated deep within the Sky Severing Mountains, is surrounded by demonic sects. Legend claims that the valley is like a幽冥地狱 (literal translation:幽冥 Hell; contextual translation: hellish abyss), fraught with peril, yet also containing heavenly opportunities.</p><p>It's not surprising to find Heavenly Corpse Sect cultivators in the Boundless Valley.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang cautiously said, “With all due respect, senior, if this strange person is connected to this peculiar technique, I do have some means of influencing him. However, this influence is limited; I can't control him.”</p><p>Back in the Heavenly Corpse Cave, he couldn't even control a reanimated corpse at the early stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Each Heavenly Corpse Talisman is meticulously crafted by the necromancer, infusing their soul imprint during the process. Though the person may be dead, the soul imprint remains.</p><p>Unless the original owner wills it, outsiders can hardly replace it.</p><p>The reanimated corpse's owner is surely dead.  While Qin Sang can't control an ownerless Heavenly Corpse Talisman, he can use the techniques of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* to restrict its movements.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't determine how effective such restrictions would be against a powerful reanimated corpse.</p><p>If it truly were a Sky-Soaring Night Rakshasa, Qin Sang felt it best to avoid it.</p><p>Yun Youzi frowned, lost in thought for a long time, before speaking to Qin Sang.</p><p>“Qin junior brother, the few places I know, some are almost as dangerous as the Boundless Valley, and even if I go, it’s not certain my injuries will be healed.</p><p>“At least, I have reliable information that there is a spiritual herb in the Boundless Valley that would benefit me.</p><p>“While the Boundless Valley is perilous, I know a route that allows safe passage into the valley. I’ve traversed it before; there shouldn’t be too much danger.</p><p>“Once we reach the location, I only need your assistance in attempting to restrict that strange person.  We don't need to kill him; just buying some time will suffice.</p><p>“If it doesn't work, we'll retreat immediately.</p><p>“If we succeed in entering, I'll proceed alone afterward.  You don't need to continue taking risks, nor wait for me. Just leave the Boundless Valley discreetly.</p><p>“Regardless of success or failure, I am indebted to you, junior brother. Once I return to my sect, I’ll shamelessly ask my senior brothers for a Harmony Pill for you.”</p><p>Having gone this far, Qin Sang couldn’t refuse. He shook his head and said, “Senior, where did you hear such talk? Since you wish it, I will gladly accompany you.”</p><p>The Boundless Valley is in the Sky Severing Mountains, and he planned on returning to Mount Shao Hua to collect the earth-sha spirit energy.  A trip to the Boundless Valley on his way back wouldn't take much extra time.</p><p>Furthermore, Yun Youzi had made it clear the danger was minimal, and he could withdraw at any time.</p><p>Besides, Qin Sang was also very interested in the reanimated corpse.</p><p>If the corpse's owner died nearby, perhaps their remains were still there, and he might find clues to the latter half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*. Even without Yun Youzi's promise, it was worth the trip.</p><p>“When does senior intend to set out?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's agreement, Yun Youzi was quite pleased. After a moment of contemplation, he said, “Besides that strange person, the Boundless Valley contains many other strange beings and restrictions. I need to prepare a few things to increase our chances of success, so I can’t leave immediately.  How about this, I will return to my sect to prepare, and we can meet at the entrance of the Boundless Valley in a year’s time.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.  “So soon? Senior doesn’t intend to wait for the Purple Star Secret Realm auction?”</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head.  “I can’t afford the Purple Star Secret Realm auction; I only planned to join in the fun.  Healing my injuries is more important. Once we enter the Sky Severing Mountains, Qin junior brother, remember to be careful. It's best to disguise yourselves as demonic cultivators, and don't reveal your identity as disciples of Mount Shao Hua.”</p><p>Qin Sang was confident in this regard and wasn't worried at all.</p><p>He just had to show his necromantic skills, he wouldn’t need to disguise himself at all—he’d look even more like a demonic cultivator than a real one.</p><p>After further discussion and planning, Yun Youzi left Yin Mountain Pass that night and returned to his sect to make preparations.</p><p># Get 888 Cash Red Envelopes # Follow the WeChat public account "Book Friends Camp," read popular masterpieces, and win 888 cash red envelopes!</p><p>Qin Sang began to ponder the next leg of the journey.</p><p>They had agreed to meet again in a year.  This short timeframe wouldn't allow for a return trip to Xuanlu Pass; thankfully, Xuanlu Pass was safe, so returning wasn't necessary.</p><p>They had used an ancient teleportation array at Shangyuan Quiet Palace on the way there, but the return journey would require traveling the traditional way.</p><p>After rescuing Shi Hong, they would head south to Shaohua Mountain. After refining the living corpses, they would set off for Wuya Valley, essentially traversing the entire Xiaohan region.  Time would be tight.</p><p>Thankfully, they had acquired the Youluo Cloud artifact; otherwise, time would indeed be extremely short.</p><p>...</p><p>Fengcang Market Town.</p><p>There are three safe routes from Yinshan Pass into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Each route has a town or market town, situated roughly parallel to each other and equidistant from Yinshan Pass.</p><p>Fengcang Market Town is one of them.</p><p>Though called a market town, its prosperity rivals that of many larger towns.</p><p>Similar to Xihuang Town, it's not built within a secluded realm but exposed, only activating its protective formation when celestial events occur.</p><p>However, Fengcang Market Town's geography is drastically different from Xihuang Town.</p><p>Fengcang Market Town is built on a mountain rising from a swamp. Though not particularly tall, this is due to the strange terrain of Yinshan Pass.</p><p>The protective formation encompasses the entire mountain.  Houses are built layer upon layer from the foot to the summit, densely packed without much space between them.</p><p>Many cultivators are active in Fengcang Market Town, with numerous figures visible in the streets.</p><p>In the back mountains, rows of small courtyards appear extremely crowded.</p><p>There are no lush bamboo forests or flowing springs; no scenic beauty at all.  Its only advantage is its tranquility.</p><p>Unbeknownst to many, these courtyards and their surrounding area are a treasure in Fengcang Market Town.</p><p>The spiritual energy is extremely dense, suitable as cultivation residences for Foundation Establishment cultivators. The courtyards look unremarkable, but they actually conceal powerful restrictions, allowing cultivators to safely practice without safety concerns.</p><p>Of course, most cultivators can't afford to live in such places.</p><p>One of the courtyards contains only three wooden houses, looking quite simple.</p><p>The main hall is silent.</p><p>A young man sits cross-legged on a wooden bed, deeply absorbed in cultivation.</p><p>If Qin Sang were here, he would immediately recognize him: Liang Yan!</p>
