<h1>Chapter 707: Terrifying Great Demon</h1><p>The others hadn't emerged yet.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what was happening in the cavern, but if they couldn't make a decision soon, they might not be able to escape. He couldn't worry about them.</p><p>In his haste, Qin Sang glanced back.</p><p>The figures in the white cloud immediately spotted him. A streak of light separated from the cloud and rapidly chased after him.</p><p>"As I suspected, there's more than one!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought, not pausing for even a moment as he flew with all his might.</p><p>The pursuer seemed to notice Qin Sang's exceptional escape technique, and they were already quite far apart.</p><p>A reckless chase in the Demonic Sea would easily attract demonic beasts, which was clearly unwise.  Seeing that the pursuit was hopeless, the figure eventually gave up.</p><p>However, when the pursuer returned to the white cloud, its speed increased dramatically.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't look back, fleeing into the distance.  After flying a considerable distance and confirming no one was following, he quietly landed on the water's surface.</p><p>"Why is there no activity over there? Did they reach some sort of agreement, or were those in the cavern instantly killed?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked back and pondered.</p><p>Just as this thought crossed his mind, a blinding sword light suddenly flashed from that location, followed by an incredibly sharp sword cry.</p><p>"Good! They're fighting!"</p><p>A smile appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>"It's Lan..."</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the blue-robed scholar's spirit sword. The sword light was definitely his.  It seemed he had encountered a powerful enemy, as this sword strike was clearly made with all his strength.</p><p>This person's swordsmanship was actually stronger than Qin Sang's. Even if he hadn't grasped the Sword Qi Thunder Sound, he wasn't far off.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly shocked. This person had hidden his true abilities. During their previous conversation, he had humbly asked Qin Sang several questions about swordsmanship, and Qin Sang hadn't noticed anything unusual.  None of them were easy to deal with.</p><p>Qin Sang would have to be on full alert against such a sword strike.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a buzzing sound suddenly erupted, overpowering the sword cry.</p><p>Then, at the point where the sword light was directed, a strange, indistinct phantom appeared. Qin Sang was certain it wasn't a human figure, but rather the shape of an insect.</p><p>"Insect control! It really is a Witch Clan member. Someone's a traitor! It seems Lan and these people aren't allies..."</p><p>Qin Sang concealed himself, flew higher, and observed from afar. He could most clearly see the sword light and the insect phantom battling, seemingly evenly matched, unable to determine a victor for the moment.</p><p>While watching the fight, Qin Sang opened the withered old man's storage pouch. His divine sense quickly swept over the items inside, and his expression suddenly shifted.</p><p>A white bone as thick as an adult's thigh and a full ten feet long leaped out of the pouch.</p><p>"A Great Demon's bone! It emits the same aura as the beast hide!"</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed the bone and found it dull, devoid of spiritual energy, and extremely brittle.  Clearly, like the beast hide, it had been completely corroded.</p><p>"This man and the stout cultivator were definitely partners. Apart from the bone, there's nothing of value in the storage pouch.  It seems they really only found some scraps in the cave. Could it be they exhausted their resources to open the Nascent Soul cave, were overjoyed, only to discover the treasures had all been corroded by the cold mist? Driven by despair, they decided to use this place as bait, lure in a few people, and kill them to recoup their losses?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, "Or is there some treasure land sealed deep within the cavern, requiring a special condition to open? Capturing someone and asking them would provide answers."</p><p>The waves there were monstrous, the battle's momentum vast. Even from high in the air, the island was obscured. The fluctuations from colliding true essence were intense and frequent.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang noticed the battlefield shifting. One side seemed to be retreating, perhaps trying to escape.</p><p>"They haven't been able to defeat Lan after so long.  It seems my guess was right. Although the withered old man's companion controls a strange white cloud and possesses astonishing speed, their strength is limited.  If I return now, I can instantly kill one of them and easily turn the tide of the battle."</p><p>Qin Sang thought, but he hesitated, unsure if these people were feigning weakness to lure him back.</p><p>"Even if the newcomer is extremely powerful, they couldn't have thought of this method to attract me so quickly, right?  Such a large commotion might attract the Great Demon, which would be a loss for everyone. Moreover, I didn't use my full strength earlier. With the Sword Qi Thunder Sound, they wouldn't be able to catch me even with the white cloud. If they insist on pursuing me, it becomes a contest of true essence reserves, and I have the Corpse Pill, so I'm not afraid."</p><p>Qin Sang decided to approach stealthily and observe.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as he flew back a short distance, an inexplicable sense of danger washed over him. His hair stood on end, as if a terrifying presence was approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped abruptly and turned his head, his face filled with uncertainty.</p><p>The next moment, he saw ripples suddenly appear on the sea surface to his left. Beneath the ripples, a massive dark shadow, resembling both a dragon and a fish, slowly emerged from the depths.</p><p>Seeing this shadow, Qin Sang's scalp went numb. It was likely a late-stage Demon Core Great Demon!</p><p>This area of the sea actually concealed such a terrifying Great Demon!  It was probably slumbering and had been awakened by the battle. Now that it had appeared, it would definitely devour someone!</p><p>Fortunately, the Great Demon was attracted by the battle ahead and hadn't noticed Qin Sang, who was relatively closer.</p><p>Qin Sang held his breath and slowly retreated. The battle ahead continued, and no one noticed the terrifying shadow swiftly swimming over beneath the sea surface. Danger was approaching!</p><p>After retreating a certain distance, Qin Sang turned and fled without looking back. Treasures, spirit fire, everything was forgotten.</p><p>Before a Great Demon, there was no chance of luck. The others could only pray for themselves.</p><p>"Crash!"</p><p>Not long after he began flying, Qin Sang heard a deafening roar of waves. He looked back in alarm and saw a white line appear on the sea surface behind him. A wall of water, dozens of feet high, was chasing him.</p><p>He seemed to hear a faint, miserable scream.</p><p>Qin Sang increased his altitude and only saw a vast expanse of white waves. A gigantic demonic beast was tumbling among them, seemingly playing. As for the cultivators, they had long been swallowed by the waves, nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Even the island seemed to tremble under the giant waves stirred up by the demonic beast.</p><p>So many cultivators faced with a single demonic beast seemed utterly helpless. He didn't know how many could escape.</p><p>As dusk approached, witnessing this scene, Qin Sang resolutely fled, chasing the setting sun.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated the battle wouldn't last much longer, but he didn't dare pause, fearing the Great Demon would come after him next after dealing with the others.</p><p>Even after the battlefield was out of sight, the ripples from the battle hadn't subsided, spreading far and wide across the sea surface below Qin Sang, although they appeared much weaker.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang thought the battle was over, a thunderous roar suddenly erupted from behind him!</p>
