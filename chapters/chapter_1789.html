<h1>Chapter 1780: The True Essence Pill</h1><p>“I’d like to hear more.”</p><p>Qin Sang said, already suspecting the answer.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren’s following words were exactly as he expected.</p><p>“If your ancestor left behind a legacy, go directly to the Dao Court.  They value their reputation and generally won't cause trouble. For example, if your sect has ancient ties to the Dao Court, or if your ancestor made significant contributions during past wars between the two sides.”</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren continued without pausing, implying that if Qin Sang came from such a sect, he wouldn’t need to ask for his advice.</p><p>“If you approach them, the Dao Court will give you two choices. If you are willing to serve them, obtaining powerful techniques will not be difficult.”</p><p>“Wouldn't that make one a servant of the Dao Court?” Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe the Dao Court would treat them as equals. Human nature is such that regardless of time, place, sect, or school of thought, there will always be distinctions.</p><p>If a life-threatening mission arises, the Dao Court would certainly prioritize these individuals.</p><p>Being controlled by others—how could one achieve freedom?</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren explained, “Those who cultivate to this level possess superior mentality and talent. The Dao Court wouldn't truly treat them as servants. Usually, the Dao Court doesn't interfere.  They say that responding to the Dao Court’s summons comes with generous rewards, and those unwilling to respond aren’t forced.  But if war breaks out between the Dao Court and Guifang, then…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded; he could imagine.</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator holding a position of power within the Dao Court wouldn't lightly sacrifice such a powerful expert.</p><p>Currently, the Dao Court and Guifang are merely in a standoff, maintaining restraint.</p><p>However, no one can predict when this situation will change.</p><p>If one side suddenly launches a war, it would instantly drag Jushan Prefecture into conflict—it’s happened before.</p><p>“If one doesn't want to be subservient to the Dao Court, what then?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren simply replied, “Exchange life for advancement!”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, thinking, as expected, it's the same as the Dao Court’s summons from Heming Mountain—earning merit to gain advancement.</p><p>However…</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts turned, “The Dao Court wouldn't send people to die, would they?”</p><p>Cultivators in this world typically seek advancement when their cultivation reaches its peak, nearing a breakthrough.</p><p>In other words, Jushan Prefecture cultivators need to contact the Dao Court at the peak of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>At that time, they haven't reached the Nascent Soul stage yet.</p><p>The Dao Court wouldn't assign them Nascent Soul-level missions; otherwise, it would be akin to murder for profit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhijian Zhenren shook his head slightly, saying under Qin Sang’s surprised gaze, “To my knowledge, these summons are generally of two types. The first requires the abilities of a Dongxuan expert to complete. The second is less dangerous but often requires a hundred or even several hundred years, during which one cannot be distracted, and failure is possible.  They also need to prepare for their breakthrough—how much time do they have to spare? Those unwilling to be bound by the Dao Court are proud and ambitious; they usually prioritize their own breakthrough before responding to the Dao Court’s summons for advancement.”</p><p>The Dao Court is ruthless!</p><p>Those who dare to break through before advancement, seeking freedom, are also extraordinary.</p><p>The breakthrough to Nascent Soul is vastly different from the breakthrough to Golden Core; the Nascent Soul stage involves Heavenly Tribulations!</p><p>The Three Heavenly Tribulations and the Demon Tribulation can both be fatal.</p><p>Undergoing tribulation before advancement, exceeding the protective power of one's cultivation base, with unstable True Qi, passing the Three Heavenly Tribulations is extremely difficult.</p><p>However, this place is better than the life-threatening Storm Realm. The influence of the Six Heavenly Qi on the mind is gradual, unlike the Heavenly Demon Sound, which has an immediate effect. Therefore, the power of the Demon Tribulation will not be stronger.</p><p>Even so, one wouldn't dare do this without immense confidence and strength.</p><p>But even if they successfully break through, they must suppress their True Qi like him, greatly weakening their strength. How can they complete Nascent Soul-level missions?</p><p>Qin Sang asked this question.</p><p>“Upon receiving the summons, the Dao Court will bestow a True Essence Pill.  During the duration of the pill's effect, one can restore their peak strength and remain unaffected by the Six Heavenly Qi,” Zhijian Zhenren’s tone changed; he suddenly smiled, “In this matter, force cultivators who practice the Dragon Tiger Art, like yourself, are the least worried.”</p><p>Qin Sang instantly understood.</p><p>Force cultivators cultivate their bodies; their only fear is mental confusion, and the Dragon Tiger Art protects the mind.</p><p>They can break through without advancement without worry; their strength won't be affected, and their chances of surviving the tribulation are high.</p><p>After breaking through, force cultivators can still maintain powerful combat abilities, while others must suppress their True Qi to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>This is one of the reasons many cultivators choose the Dragon Tiger Art over orthodox Daoist cultivation.</p><p>“There’s actually a True Essence Pill, such a divine medicine!”</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed.</p><p>The Daoist sect is deeply rooted in this world, surely having discovered many ways to deal with the Six Heavenly Qi; techniques are the most complete system.</p><p>The True Essence Pill is a pill; its effects are not permanent, and each person is limited to one, undoubtedly invaluable.</p><p>Qin Sang has traveled to many places, but hasn't seen it sold anywhere.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren continued, "Moreover, compared to cultivators from the other two schools, you should find receiving a summons easier."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred.</p><p>From Zhijian Zhenren's tone, it seemed the difference lay in the three schools' summoning practices.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang's expression turned serious, and he asked in a low voice, "What if I don't wish to accept the Long Hu Altar's summons?"</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren, a man of great insight, instantly understood the underlying meaning in Qin Sang's words. His gaze sharpened, and he exclaimed in surprise, "You're a Dharma cultivator?"</p><p>The three major schools of Daoism, the Jin Yin Altar and the Bing Ma Altar, are essentially Dharma cultivators who cultivate True Essence.</p><p>The Long Hu Altar is unique; its practitioners cannot stabilize True Essence, but they can enhance their cultivation speed in terms of physical strength.</p><p>For the Long Hu Altar, one cannot have both fish and bear's paw. Cultivators at each realm can only choose one cultivation method of the same level.  Because of its unique cultivation method, the Long Hu Altar cannot stabilize True Essence and must focus solely on physical strength. Unless one undergoes a transformation and changes Daoist cultivation methods, starting over from scratch, dual cultivation is impossible.</p><p>While the other two schools can accommodate body refinement, firstly, their cultivation is already difficult; secondly, without the Long Hu Altar's enhancement, their results are inferior to true physical cultivators, making dual cultivation extremely rare.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang's path to body refinement was accidental.  The *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique stagnated throughout his Yuan Ying stage. After reaching the Hua Shen stage, he first prepared for a journey to Gui Xu across the eastern sea, then, compelled by a heavenly tribulation, he reluctantly resumed this technique.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly but didn't explicitly state whether he was originally a Dharma cultivator or a physical cultivator who transformed into a Dharma cultivator.</p><p>"No wonder your poison techniques are so formidable," Zhijian Zhenren shook his head repeatedly, seemingly lamenting his own lack of discernment.  "Not cultivating the Long Hu Altar's methods is a good thing. You should have noticed that the Long Hu Altar isn't orthodox Daoism; it's a dead end."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred. "I've heard rumors, but I'm not certain...is it because of demonic techniques?"</p><p>Rumors among cultivators often carry weight. The Long Hu Altar's techniques were supposedly based on demonic cultivation methods.  This world is clearly more suitable for physical cultivators, and many cultivate the Long Hu Altar's techniques, yet Daoist true disciples scorn them.  Something unusual is afoot.</p><p>Qin Sang had long suspected this.</p><p>"Correct," Zhijian Zhenren nodded. "Demons are gifted with innate abilities; their bloodline power can enhance demonic techniques. We humans lack bloodline abilities, so how can we compare? While the exact limits of the Long Hu Altar are unknown, the fact that almost no esteemed masters in the Dao Court cultivate its methods speaks volumes."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this.  Guardian deities aren't easily obtained and provide lasting peace of mind.</p><p>The altar is not only a place of peace, but also a divine dwelling.  If the altar is unstable, the deities will be restless – this is the greatest hidden danger of the Long Hu Altar!</p><p>"If you seek Daoist cultivation methods but wish to avoid Daoist control, you must plan carefully," Zhijian Zhenren cautioned.</p><p>"Thank you for your guidance!"</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and bowed.</p><p>While he could have investigated this himself, the information would have been mixed with truth and falsehood, unlike the detailed explanation from Zhijian Zhenren.  Knowing this will allow him to act more effectively.</p><p>"There's no need for such formality,"</p><p>Zhijain Zhenren waved his hands repeatedly, then gave Qin Sang an address. "The Dao Court's two academies have dispatched a master specifically for this matter. His Dharma name is Zhan Gui, and he's in seclusion on a spirit island north of Xingdao Lake.  Before visiting Master Zhan Gui, you might inform me."</p><p>"Did you receive your promotion through this Master Zhan Gui?" Qin Sang wrote down the island's location.</p><p>Zhijien Zhenren said, "I've met Master Zhan Gui a few times. While I may not be able to guarantee anything, I doubt he'll make things difficult for you."</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "I need to prepare, and it will likely take a few years before I can answer the summons."</p><p>Daoist summons vary in difficulty, and the tasks assigned depend entirely on Master Zhan Gui's decision. Having a recommendation is certainly beneficial.</p><p>"No worries; I won't be leaving Jianxin Island anytime soon."</p><p>After settling the matter, Qin Sang stayed on Jianxin Island for several days.</p><p>Above the vast waters, two figures flew through the air; it was Qin Sang and Zhijian Zhenren.</p><p>They proceeded leisurely, chatting as they flew north.</p><p>"Two fellow cultivators reside on Youhuang Island, three hundred miles away. They should have received the message and are waiting for us," Zhijian Zhenren pointed north.</p><p>They were going to see Zhijian Zhenren's friends, reportedly two Hua Shen stage cultivators.</p><p>"Their Dharma names are Gu Yun and Youhuang.  Youhuang Zhenren is a female cultivator, and Youhuang Island is her Daoist grounds. Neither are aloof individuals..."</p><p>Zhijien Zhenren briefly introduced them.</p><p>Qin Sang took note, giving Zhijian Zhenren a subtle glance. He sensed that the recommendation was not merely for acquaintance, but had ulterior motives.</p><p>Shortly, they descended from the sky and landed on a charming spirit island filled with flowers and bamboo.</p><p>Several beautiful women stood respectfully amidst the blossoming flowers.  Upon seeing the guests, they bowed and led them to the secluded cave dwelling of the two Masters.</p><p>Master Youhuang, appearing barely twenty years old, was petite with bright, expressive eyes.  Her smile was as captivating as a crescent moon, making her resemble a charming young maiden.</p><p>Qin Sang was most captivated by Master Guyun, the other Master.</p><p>Master Guyun was tall and straight as a pine tree, a cultivator of formidable physical strength, which he didn’t attempt to conceal. His vital energy was exceptionally potent, even surpassing Qin Sang's, despite Qin Sang's ordeal in the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Master Zhijian introduced the three, they exchanged greetings, and settled into their respective places.</p><p>The maidservants brought forth celestial fruits and exquisite wines, all rare delicacies with intoxicating aromas that stimulated the appetite.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't resist several cups.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, Master Zhijian seemed genuinely intent on fostering a friendship.</p><p>The group conversed amicably.  They sometimes discussed Daoist secrets, which Qin Sang listened to quietly. At other times, they debated Daoist practices, occasions when Qin Sang would cautiously participate, carefully concealing his identity as an outsider.</p><p>Their lively gathering continued until late into the night.</p><p>Master Youhuang warmly urged them to stay, and Masters Guyun and Zhijian intended to remain for a few more days. However, Qin Sang, mindful of the precious fragment, rose to take his leave.</p><p>"Cultivation interspersed with socializing and relaxation...quite tranquil," Qin Sang mused as he flew away from Youhuang Island.  Reflecting on his eight hundred years of life, such leisurely moments were rare.</p><p>"Once I obtain the Dharma Artifact, I will find a secluded dwelling, cultivate friendships with a few companions; if a war breaks out, we can support each other.  In times of peace, I can focus on my cultivation…it seems quite appealing," Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>In the Storm World, he was constantly driven by various events. Due to his insufficient innate talent, he had to seize opportunities relentlessly. Now, as a Nascent Soul cultivator, he was relatively young and his cultivation talent had been enhanced; ordinary treasures held little appeal, so why continue his restless travels?</p><p>Of course, this didn't imply complacency.</p><p>"I'll escort you a short distance," a voice called from behind. Master Zhijian had flown to his side.</p><p>"What was your impression of them?" Master Zhijian asked.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, puzzled. "They are all exceptional talents."  In any world, achieving the Nascent Soul realm is no easy feat.</p><p>At this point, Master Zhijian finally revealed his true intentions. "My invitation, friend, was borne of selfish motives."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him, unsurprised.</p><p>"For years, I've been preparing for a significant undertaking, requiring entry into the Mire.  Youhuang and Guyun are my recruited allies.  Incidentally, this matter is related to the Daoist Court.  I initially believed you might be from a Daoist temple, and I know you're a trustworthy person. If I could persuade you to join, you'd not only be a reliable ally, but you could also help me uncover information that has eluded me for some time," Master Zhijian explained candidly.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "Unfortunately, I am not."</p><p>"However, I still wish to invite you," Master Zhijian said sincerely. "If this endeavor succeeds, you'll not only receive substantial rewards but also directly obtain eligibility for the Dharma Artifact. Furthermore, working together, we can provide mutual support, far safer than facing this alone."</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly taken aback. He hadn't revealed his true strength to Master Zhijian. Generally speaking, those who haven't obtained a Dharma Artifact are weaker than those who have.</p><p>Master Zhijian's invitation seemed to hold a genuine concern for his well-being, stemming from their positive interactions.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could reply, Master Zhijian continued, "There's one more piece of information we haven't confirmed yet; we're awaiting news, and it should be verified shortly. Then I’ll explain everything. You don't have to decide immediately; you can visit Master Zangui first, compare the difficulty of obtaining a Daoist summons and a Dharma Artifact, and then make your decision. Even if you choose the summons, if you need my assistance, I will offer my full support!"</p><p>This presented Qin Sang with two options.  Master Zhijian's undertaking was certainly more perilous, but it offered mutual support.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang nodded slightly. "I will heed your advice. I should visit Master Zangui within three to five years, and we can discuss this further then."</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>Master Zhijian halted his flight.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, activated his flying talisman, and headed south, returning to Hucheng.</p><p></p>
