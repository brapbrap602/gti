Chapter 328: Unsold

The mysterious Golden Core cultivator paused, then spoke in a seductive tone: “Purple Micro Palace is the most mysterious immortal abode deep within the ancient immortal battlefield, a sacred place that even Nascent Soul cultivators would not miss. Countless Foundation Establishment cultivators have racked their brains to obtain a single Purple Micro Secret Map; the treasures within are incredibly valuable.

If any of you wish to enter Purple Micro Palace to seek treasure, now is the best opportunity.  If you miss this Secret Map, finding another will be far more difficult. Your cultivations haven't reached the Foundation Establishment stage yet. Even if you come from renowned sects, your Nascent Soul ancestors cannot guarantee your entry into Purple Micro Palace. You must obtain a Purple Micro Secret Map to ensure a safe passage.  I was just a Qi Condensation cultivator when Purple Micro Palace last appeared. I still vividly remember the upheaval caused by the Secret Map!”

A wistful tone filled the mysterious Golden Core cultivator's voice.

The hall fell silent. No one doubted the cultivator's words; this auction was organized by the Yin Mountain Pass, openly and publicly.  Yin Mountain Pass would not risk its reputation to collude with a Golden Core cultivator in a lie.

The issue was the obvious immense value of this item, based solely on the description. The question was what price the mysterious Golden Core cultivator would demand.  Was it truly worthwhile to pay a huge price for what's essentially a ticket, only to possibly get even better treasures inside? It couldn't be that simple, could it?  And if Purple Micro Palace truly held such riches, why was this cultivator auctioning the map?

Qin Sang thought about his own 'sheepskin.'  If it was also a Purple Micro Secret Map, that would explain why all his previous attempts to activate it had failed. As the mysterious Golden Core cultivator had mentioned, with signs of the spiritual tide appearing, Purple Micro Palace was about to open, and the maps would appear accordingly, subsequently leading to competition for entry. He hadn't considered the 'sheepskin' held such a secret, keeping it in the corner of his storage pouch since arriving at the ancient immortal battlefield without further investigation.

A murmur rippled through the hall.

The Daoist who had purchased the Golden Water Formation cautiously asked, "To my knowledge, only Nascent Soul and Foundation Establishment cultivators have explored Purple Micro Palace in the past. Even then, many have perished within.  Purple Micro Palace must be incredibly dangerous.  We Foundation Establishment cultivators would be risking certain death if we entered; who would dare to covet its treasures?"

The Daoist's words resolved everyone's doubts.  Purple Micro Palace was undeniably a perilous place; not even Nascent Soul and Foundation Establishment cultivators were guaranteed safety. For them, Foundation Establishment cultivators, entry meant certain death.

Immediately, everyone's enthusiasm waned.

The mysterious Golden Core cultivator remained patient, unangered, and chuckled.  "Indeed, Foundation Establishment cultivators who entered Purple Micro Palace were few, but not non-existent. Those who have cultivated to this level surely understand that great rewards come with great risks. One cannot expect smooth sailing and rapid cultivation progress; the world doesn't offer such easy advantages.  Purple Micro Palace contains many treasures that can alter one's destiny and transform one's being. Thousands of years ago, a False Core cultivator emerged from Purple Micro Palace and achieved Nascent Soul within a century.  Furthermore, the elixirs and secret techniques you've been seeking, even scouring heaven and earth, can only be found within Purple Micro Palace.  Will you live an ordinary life, or will you fight for a chance at greatness?  The choice is yours."

A hush fell over the hall as everyone pondered.

The mysterious Golden Core cultivator said nothing more. Gao Yi, receiving a signal, announced loudly, “One Purple Micro Secret Map! The starting bid is one magical treasure, even a damaged one will do, any type!”

"Hiss…"

The crowd gasped.  They had anticipated a high price, but no one expected it to be a magical treasure!

A few who had been tempted by the mysterious Golden Core cultivator's words were immediately deterred by the price. Not every Golden Core cultivator possessed a magical treasure, especially those who had recently broken through; most were still striving for their first lifebound treasure.  This was even more true for the Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Besides, the choice was clear: a vague possibility of great fortune versus a precious magical treasure. The weight of the matter was obvious. A magical treasure wouldn't be exchanged! Even a damaged treasure was easier to repair than to create anew. Once they reached the Golden Core stage, obtaining a treasure would be swift. This temptation far outweighed Purple Micro Palace.  Only those with no other hope, those prepared to bet everything, would make the exchange.

Qin Sang relaxed, leaning back in his chair. He possessed the Ten Directions Yama Banner and the Primal Harmony Ring, two magical treasures, but neither could be revealed, and he had no need to exchange them.


Even if his "sheepskin" is a genuine Ziwu secret scroll, he must wait until he returns to his sect to thoroughly investigate Ziwu Palace before making a decision.

The mysterious golden elixir's words were evasive and contained many falsehoods; Ziwu Palace is certainly not simple.

If the rewards and risks are not commensurate, there's no need to risk one's life.

If the Ziwu secret scroll is truly worth a magic artifact, then perhaps...

Qin Sang stroked his chin, lost in thought, no longer paying attention to the auction.  This Ziwu secret scroll would most likely go unsold; he wondered if there would be any suckers.

As Qin Sang expected, after Gao Yi hawked it for a while like a peddler, no one bid, and he finally announced that the Ziwu secret scroll had failed to sell.

"It seems I'll have to stay a few more days in Yinshan Pass."

The mysterious golden elixir retrieved the Ziwu secret scroll, smiling, showing no regret whatsoever at its failure to sell.

Qin Sang suddenly understood. The mysterious golden elixir likely never intended for the scroll to be sold; instead, he used this method to spread news of the scroll, attracting those with the power to obtain it.

His true goal was the subsequent Nascent Soul stage cultivator auction!

Of course, if it had been sold, exchanging a Ziwu secret scroll for a magic artifact would have been a good deal.

What a sly old fox.

Qin Sang cursed under his breath. Hearing Gao Yi announce the end of the auction, he immediately stood up, squeezed through the crowd, and walked into the darkness.

Along the way, Qin Sang's ears buzzed as many people sent voice transmissions, hoping he would sell a Ghost-attracting Herb. The offers were high, but Qin Sang refused them all.

Entering the darkness, Qin Sang immediately changed into a new robe and mask, completely altering his appearance.  He carefully checked to ensure no one had left any markers before stepping out.

Emerging from the darkness, Qin Sang found that most people had done the same, all looking unfamiliar.

Some chose to leave the Stone Island immediately; most, however, planned to stay for a few more days.

The crowd dispersed into the streets.  Qin Sang walked inconspicuously, detecting no pursuers. He then found an opportunity to change his attire again.
