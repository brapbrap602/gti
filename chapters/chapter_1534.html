<h1></h1><p>Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>After meeting with Mu Yifeng, Qin Sang spent a month traveling far and wide, visiting old friends.</p><p>Most of his time was spent in the Lesser Cold Domain.</p><p>It was equivalent to retracing half of his cultivation journey.</p><p>Having cultivated to the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang's temperament wouldn't be overly affected by this journey. His purpose was simply to look around and reminisce about the past.</p><p>This departure for the Central Province, who knew when he would return.</p><p>After making a full circle, Qin Sang finally arrived at Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Unable to return to the Seven Kill Palace to cherish the final writings of Senior Qing Zhu, he could only pay his respects at his tomb.</p><p>Inside the wooden pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang placed four wine cups on the table.</p><p>He tried to be sparing, but his treasured Peach Blossom Wine was almost depleted. This Peach Blossom Wine was carefully brewed by Senior Sister Qing Jun, sweet and clear, far surpassing others.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how to brew, nor did he want to learn.</p><p>He raised his cup.</p><p>One cup was dedicated to Qing Zhu.</p><p>Two cups were respectively raised in distant respect to Senior Sister and Bai.</p><p>……</p><p>Green Goat Temple.</p><p>A crowd gathered in front of the restricted area.</p><p>Li Yufu, Shangguan Lifeng, Mei Gu, Zhao Ying, and other renowned Core Formation cultivators were all present.</p><p>"Senior Brother, I wonder what major event the Temple Master is going to announce this time? Could it be that he brought back some treasure from the North Sea?" Zhao Ying walked to Li Yufu's side and asked softly.</p><p>Zhao Ying had the least interaction with Qin Sang. Her previous understanding was limited to various rumors, and she both respected and feared Qin Sang.</p><p>After Qing Jun ascended, she joined the Green Goat Temple. She was initially worried about being ostracized, but found that the Green Goat Temple had a spirit of mutual respect and love, without any atmosphere of power struggles, giving her a true sense of belonging.</p><p>"Junior Brother Tan has always handled the sect's affairs. If there are any major movements within the temple, Junior Brother Tan should be the most informed. Why isn't he here?"</p><p>Mei Gu interjected, looking around, but she couldn't find Tan Yien.</p><p>"Senior Sister just returned, you probably don't know yet?"</p><p>Bai Hanqiu said with a hint of envy, "Senior Brother Tan has struck it rich. Senior Tan and Master reunited in the North Sea and returned together. Moreover, Senior Tan is already a Nascent Soul cultivator. Master has invited Senior Tan to be the Grand Elder of Green Goat Temple."</p><p>"Nascent Soul!"</p><p>Mei Gu was naturally overjoyed.</p><p>The stronger the Green Goat Temple became, the more its disciples would benefit.</p><p>Jing Yu was close to the Green Goat Temple, but he was more like a guest elder.</p><p>The Green Goat Temple was still in its initial stages, with only a leader and no elders.</p><p>Tan Hao was the first.</p><p>After the joy, Mei Gu remembered something and said with a charming smile, "Junior Brother Tan probably won't be able to continue his leisurely life, right? Previously, I was very envious of him for not having to suffer the hardships of cultivation."</p><p>Bai Hanqiu shrugged and was about to say something when the fog in the restricted area churned and parted, forming a small path. Qin Sang's voice came from within, calling Li Yufu and the others to enter.</p><p>The crowd became solemn and silent, their expressions respectful, and they entered the restricted area without looking sideways.</p><p>Qin Sang had just returned from the Green Goat Temple's spirit vein, where he had planted the root of the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree, set up restrictions, and carefully nurtured it.</p><p>"Greetings, Temple Master!"</p><p>Li Yufu and the others bowed in unison.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, told them to rise, and pointed to Tan Hao sitting beside him. "From now on, Brother Tan will be the Grand Elder of Green Goat Temple. Seeing Elder Tan is equivalent to seeing me."</p><p>Tan Yien stood behind Tan Hao.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how this father and son communicated.</p><p>He only knew that Tan Yien still did as he pleased, while Tan Hao wore a helpless expression.</p><p>"Disciple obeys! Greetings, Elder Tan!"</p><p>Only after Li Yufu and the others bowed did they dare to secretly size up Tan Hao.</p><p>He was tall and imposing, with a dignified bearing.</p><p>They had all heard Tan Yien talk about the story between Qin Sang and Tan Hao, and knew that this person was loyal and righteous, a true hero, and they couldn't help but feel admiration.</p><p>Tan Hao returned the salute, looked at the outstanding juniors, nodded secretly, and praised Qin Sang for not only rapidly advancing himself, but also managing to build up the framework of a sect.</p><p>After introducing Tan Hao, Qin Sang announced two other major events: relocating the sect and passing the position of Temple Master to Li Yufu.</p><p>He originally wanted Tan Hao, who had the highest cultivation, to take the helm, but Tan Hao firmly refused.</p><p>One shocking piece of news after another stunned the disciples, leaving them unable to believe their ears. They were stunned for a long time before they could barely digest it.</p><p>Qin Sang brooked no argument. He had long had a plan for how to arrange the sect, and his orders were issued in an orderly manner.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang summoned Li Yufu and the others individually.</p><p>Li Yufu accepted the heavy responsibility of Temple Master, but he requested Qin Sang to stay in the North Star Region.</p><p>Although he longed for a broader world, he understood that cultivation was fundamental. He planned to continue cultivating diligently until he reached the peak of the Core Formation stage and encountered the Nascent Soul bottleneck, then he would go to the North Sea to seek opportunities.</p><p>Another reason was that the situation in the North Sea was complex and the conflicts were intense, far beyond what the North Star Region could compare to.</p><p>Compared with the great powers such as the Profound Sky Palace, the Green Goat Temple was still very weak. Tan Hao had to stay in the North Sea personally to look after it, and even Jing Yu had to frequently lend a hand.</p><p>The North Star Region was the rear base of the Green Goat Temple, and there must be a person with high enough status to hold the fort. Li Yufu was the best choice.</p><p>The second was Mei Gu.</p><p>She did not hesitate and requested Qin Sang to take her to the North Sea.</p><p>Previously, she had been bound by the responsibilities of the Demonic Flame Sect.</p><p>After Qin Sang returned, Mei Gu unloaded the heavy burden and could finally follow her heart. Without delaying her cultivation, she took every opportunity to travel around, her footprints almost covering the entire North Star Region, encountering opportunities and dangers.</p><p>Learning that the three regions of the North Sea were far vaster and more exciting than the North Star Region, Mei Gu's eyes lit up, and she almost couldn't wait a moment longer.</p><p>If Qin Sang agreed to take her to the Central Province, Mei Gu probably wouldn't hesitate.</p><p>The third was Shangguan Lifeng.</p><p>His decision was the same as Mei Gu's.</p><p>However, his goal was to meet friends through the sword and witness more exquisite sword techniques.</p><p>He had once delayed his cultivation by delving into saber techniques and the way of killing, which almost led to him being unable to form his core and his lifespan ending. After obtaining the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture", Shangguan Lifeng was completely engrossed, forgetting his previous lessons.</p><p>He confessed to Qin Sang that he knew he had not yet broken through to the mid-stage of Core Formation, and his hope of forming a Nascent Soul in the future was slim. He only wished to be single-minded in the way of the sword and achieve something.</p><p>One day, if he could cultivate a successor and carry forward Senior Qing Zhu's legacy, it would not be in vain.</p><p>Then there was Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>Over the years, she had enjoyed a loving marriage, given birth to a son and two daughters, enjoyed the happiness of family life, and personally witnessed many junior disciples surpass her in cultivation. Although she was envious, she had no regrets.</p><p>She also didn't want to leave her family and go far away to the North Sea.</p><p>She was willing to spend her old age here.</p><p>As for Tan Yien, Qin Sang didn't need to talk to him to know that he would definitely go to the North Sea.</p><p>Tan Yien's lifelong ambition had changed from cultivating the number one sect in the North Star Region to the number one sect in the North Sea. He was eager to try, full of fighting spirit.</p><p>After Tan Yien left, Bai Hanqiu would take over the position of chief steward.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu's eldest daughter possessed cultivation talent, and she was about the same age as Qin Niansui. She had previously wanted to ask Qin Sang for permission to arrange a marriage between the two.</p><p>Qin Sang was noncommittal about this.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Qin Sang took out a piece of jade, cut it into two jade pendants, suspended them in his palm, and used demonic fire to forge them into protective treasures, giving them to Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>Finally, there was Zhao Ying.</p><p>She inherited Qing Jun's orthodoxy, and Qin Sang regarded her as his junior, treating her equally.</p><p>Zhao Ying decided to stay in the North Star Region for the time being, assisting Li Yufu, and waiting for the right time to go to the North Sea.</p><p>"Take a look at these two items. Have you ever seen them before?"</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Yang Puppet Crystal and the Strange General's puppet.</p><p>He had studied them for a long time, without a clue.</p><p>It was a pity that Qing Jun was not here.</p><p>Zhao Ying was influenced by Qing Jun, and might have heard of them.</p><p>Zhao Ying took the Yang Puppet Crystal and the puppet with both hands, examined them repeatedly for a while, and her brows furrowed deeper and deeper. She apologized, sat cross-legged on the ground, closed her eyes, and performed a secret technique.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't say a word and waited patiently.</p><p>It took two full hours for Zhao Ying to wake up. She pointed to the puppet and said, "Reporting to the Temple Master, I have never seen this kind of puppet before. But I have a feeling that it is similar to Senior Qing Jun's Azure Luan Puppet in some respects. It is born because of the master's imprint in the body. Once the master falls, it will be completely silent, losing all power, and outsiders cannot control it."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded thoughtfully. He suspected that this might be the Strange General's life-bound puppet, an extremely mysterious and exquisite kind in the way of puppets.</p><p>After a pause, seeing that Qin Sang didn't speak, Zhao Ying continued, "I seem to have heard Senior Qing Jun mention this kind of puppet crystal once. At that time, Senior only mentioned it briefly, it might be a treasure used by ancient cultivators to refine puppets, and it has been lost. I don't know their function. This puppet should not have completely refined the Yin Puppet Crystal. I am dull and have racked my brains, but I can't figure out how to separate it completely and undamaged."</p><p>Qin Sang did not criticize, and his eyes showed approval.</p><p>The puppet crystal could enhance Nascent Soul-level puppets. It was already very good that Zhao Ying could see so much.</p><p>……</p><p>In the following time, the Green Goat Temple seemed calm, but in fact, there were undercurrents surging, preparing for the relocation of the sect.</p><p>Qin Sang learned from the lessons of the Profound Sky Palace and made some adjustments to the Green Goat Temple, but he also understood that it was impossible to solve the problems once and for all. The future of the Green Goat Temple was in the hands of these disciples.</p><p>In addition to the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree, he also left three things for the Green Goat Temple.</p><p>First, the sea chart of the Central Province.</p><p>Second, the formula for Spirit-Suppressing Incense.</p><p>He established a rule that in the future, only the Temple Master and the Grand Elder of the Green Goat Temple would be qualified to know these two things. The Green Goat Temple should pay attention to collecting the spirit herbs on the formula of Spirit-Suppressing Incense.</p><p>The third was the Sacrifice Origin Technique.</p><p>In the North Sea, the status of this secret technique was equivalent to an immortal technique.</p><p>By learning this technique and refining a pseudo-spirit treasure, the strength of a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator could be further improved.</p><p>Once it was spread, the entire four regions of the North Sea would be in an uproar.</p><p>The Profound Sky Palace also knew the Sacrifice Origin Technique, this technique was not a secret.</p><p>Out of multiple considerations, Qin Sang decided to leave it behind, but he set up a divine sense restriction, and only juniors who reached the Divine Sense Manifestation realm could obtain this secret technique.</p><p>With these three things, the foundation of the Green Goat Temple was no less than that of other sects.</p><p>But the Green Goat Temple was still too weak, and it would probably be a long time before it could benefit from them.</p><p>……</p><p>Half a year later.</p><p>Qin Sang personally attended the North Star Alliance Conference for the last time.</p><p>The news that a new Nascent Soul elder had appeared in the Green Goat Temple spread like wildfire, and it had already spread throughout the various sects. Seeing Qin Sang, they came forward one after another, offering congratulations.</p><p>As for what they thought in their hearts, Qin Sang didn't care. He publicly announced that he would go into seclusion, vowing to break through to the late stage of Nascent Soul.</p><p>On the third day after the conference.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tan Hao, along with Mu Yifeng and the first group of elite disciples selected from the Green Goat Temple, quietly flew to the southernmost tip of the North Star Region and met with the demons of Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea led by Jing Yu.</p><p>Since it was the first time, there were not many people.</p><p>With the help of the Ten Directions Land-Splitting Divine Shuttle, and after resting in two shelters along the way, they led these juniors through the storm belt without any danger.</p><p>Entering a brand new world, the disciples felt novelty and excitement, but after flying with Qin Sang for a few days, they felt bored, as if it was not much different from the North Star Region.</p><p>When they bypassed the demon realm on the way, Jing Yu asked about the location of the Verdant Bright Archipelago and entered the demon realm alone to travel.</p><p>The others did not stop and arrived at the Verdant Bright Archipelago smoothly.</p><p>Above Green Goat Island.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared and looked down.</p><p>He had been away for so long, but the great array on Green Goat Island was intact, and no one dared to set foot on it.</p><p>Seeing such a large sea area being exclusively enjoyed by the Green Goat Temple, and learning that Nine Precepts Island and other treasure islands were controlled by Qin Sang, Tan Yien and the others were extremely excited and even more looking forward to the future.</p><p>They had created the Green Goat Temple from scratch.</p><p>Now, opening a branch temple was naturally very familiar. Drawing on previous experience and lessons, they quickly built Green Goat Island in a decent manner.</p><p>During this period, they finally learned from outsiders about the great achievements of their own Temple Master.</p><p>In just twenty years, he had turned the Boundless Sea upside down, and his reputation spread throughout the North Sea.</p><p>In their hearts, their respect for Qin Sang had reached an unparalleled level.</p><p>At the same time, the news that Qin Sang had established a sect in the Boundless Sea spread without warning, attracting the attention of all parties.</p><p>The situation in the North Sea was complex, and there were far more things to consider than in the North Star Region.</p><p>For example, the Boundless Sea was vast, and business was prosperous. Many business alliances were not like those in the North Star Region, which were controlled by sects. They were overlords themselves.</p><p>The Green Goat Temple had to learn how to deal with them.</p><p>There were many things, too many to mention.</p><p>Qin Sang's notoriety was still there, so things were simple.</p><p>Especially since he publicly killed the Strange General a few years ago, he was unscathed, living up to his reputation. All parties had no doubts, and those restless demons also completely disappeared.</p><p>Tan Yien represented the Green Goat Temple, frequently contacting various parties. No matter how high their cultivation, they treated him with courtesy and enjoyed it.</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>The Green Goat Temple was officially established!</p><p>Tong Lingyu came out of seclusion and personally led the leaders of each branch to send congratulatory gifts.</p><p>In addition, there were also Master Feng and Valley Master Mu from the Crescent Moon Region, Daoist Yin Quan, and other famous Nascent Soul cultivators, as well as the Dao friends Qin Sang met in the Star Sand Archipelago, who all traveled thousands of miles to congratulate Qin Sang.</p><p>The forces of the Boundless Sea would naturally not be absent.</p><p>The surviving devils did not dare to come to the door in person. After killing the Strange General, Qin Sang contacted the Profound Sky Palace to search for the remnants, making them anxious. They took the opportunity to send people to deliver congratulatory gifts to show their intentions.</p><p>The grandeur of the scene was probably no less than the Dao-Achieving Celebration of a Great Cultivator.</p><p>Big shots arrived one after another, any one of them could stir up trouble in the North Star Region, and there were so many in the North Sea.</p><p>The little pride of Tan Yien and the others was shattered, and they realized that they had a long way to go.</p><p>No Demon King from the demon realm was present.</p><p>Jing Yu, who had been traveling for a long time, rushed back.</p><p>Qin Sang reminded her that the Nine-Headed Great Sage was likely in contact with the Feather King and knew about their relationship, so she had to be wary of him making a sneak attack.</p><p>Jing Yu did not visit the Nine-Headed Great Sage, but took a distant look.</p><p>This demon was a nine-headed demon serpent that had attained the Dao. Surprisingly, it had not yet transformed into a human form and maintained its demon body. When it moved, it would swallow clouds and spit fog, its aura was magnificent.</p><p>The reason Qin Sang did not let the Green Goat Temple monopolize the sea chart was precisely to guard against this demon.</p><p>The ceremony ended.</p><p>Shi Xue, Liuli, and the others stayed on Green Goat Island. Liuli's Heavenly Tribulation was coming soon.</p>
