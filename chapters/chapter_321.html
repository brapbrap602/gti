Chapter 314: Yin Mountain Pass Auction


Fortunately, the current 灵潮 (spiritual tide) is merely a sign of what is to come, it is still in its nascent stages. The actual 灵潮 invasion is at least a few decades away.
During this time, it is unlikely that the Heavenly Movement Union will recklessly start a war. At most, there will be minor skirmishes as both sides test each other's strength.
If it is truly as Senior Brother Qi said, and the Heavenly Movement Union's intention is only to harass us, then that would be the best possible outcome.
One can only hope it is so.
Qin Sang shook his head inwardly and entered the Taiyi Pill Pavilion. He was immediately greeted by a beautiful servant girl.
He spread his palm open and showed a sound transmission talisman to the servant girl in the hall. The servant girl hurriedly bowed and then led Qin Sang to the highest level of the Taiyi Pill Pavilion, where he met the Pavilion Master, Elder Wen.
Elder Wen is an old friend of the Wandering Immortal's, and is responsible for the Xuanlan Pass branch of the Taiyi Pill Sect. He holds great authority.
Three years ago, Qin Sang got to know him through the Wandering Immortal and entrusted him with the task of helping him to gather information about the Soul-calling Grass.
Although the strength of Mount Shaohua is not inferior to the Taiyi Pill Sect, when it comes to alchemy, there is a huge gap between them, both in terms of connections and resources.
It is rumored that the Taiyi Pill Sect has its fingers in every pie within the reach of the Devilish Dao's sphere of influence. Whether or not it is true, only the people of the Taiyi Pill Sect know for sure.
Facts have proven that Qin Sang did not choose the wrong person.
This sound transmission talisman was sent to his cave by Elder Wen, and it is the reason why Qin Sang left his seclusion this time.
"Fellow Daoist Qin, please have a seat!"
Elder Wen waved his hand and ordered the servant girl to退下 (leave/withdraw), and greeted Qin Sang with a warm smile.
"Qin Sang greets Elder Wen."
Qin Sang cupped his hands and, after Elder Wen's warm invitation, took a sip of the fragrant tea.
Elder Wen sized Qin Sang up, and suddenly his expression changed to surprise. "I haven't seen you for three years, and you have already broken through to the middle stage of Foundation Establishment. Congratulations!"
"Just luck."
Qin Sang cupped his hands, his face showing no trace of pride.
Elder Wen is a master who is not inferior to the Jade Sun Zi.
From what he had heard from the Wandering Immortal, Elder Wen was stuck at the bottleneck of the late stage of Foundation Establishment, and with no hope of breaking through, he decided to give up on the path of immortality and take over the business of the Taiyi Pill Pavilion.
This person was also a well-known figure in the Taiyi Pill Sect before, and his strength is unfathomable.
"Fellow Daoist Qin, have you already read the sound transmission talisman?"
After some small talk, Elder Wen got straight to the point. "The Soul-calling Grass is indeed not common. It is said that it has the effect of assisting in the cultivation of certain unorthodox cultivators. Once it appears, there will be many who will fight over it. I have contacted many friends, and in the past three years, it has appeared twice in Yin Mountain Pass, but we learned about it too late. Fortunately, this time, the news came early enough, so we can be almost certain that the Soul-calling Grass will appear at this auction."
The auction that Elder Wen mentioned was already introduced in the sound transmission talisman.
This auction will be held in Yin Mountain Pass, and it will take place a year from now.
Yin Mountain Pass is a place where all kinds of people gather, including unorthodox and righteous rogue cultivators, as well as people from both the righteous and evil paths.
Compared to other passes, Yin Mountain Pass is not firmly controlled by any powerful force, so it is very 'chaotic'. Precious treasures often appear in the auctions held here.
Therefore, every auction attracts a lot of attention. If one wants to buy the treasure they desire at an auction in Yin Mountain Pass, they must have strong实力 (strength/power).
No one dares to act recklessly at the auction.
There have been cases in the past where people who lost a bid tried to抢夺 (snatch/seize) the treasure. Without exception, they were all easily suppressed, and their corpses were hung outside the pass as a warning to others.
It is said that the mastermind behind the auction is none other than the City Lord of Yin Mountain Pass, a great cultivator of the Nascent Soul stage!
Hearing Elder Wen's words, Qin Sang pondered to himself. Since the Soul-calling Grass is in such high demand, if it is put up for auction, he is likely to have to compete with some Foundation Establishment后期 (late stage) cultivators.
As for Core Formation stage cultivators, there is no need to worry too much. It is said that the auctions in Yin Mountain Pass are also graded, and treasures that can attract the attention of Core Formation stage cultivators will not appear here.
At that time, it is inevitable that he will have to spend a lot of money.
The spirit stones on him are definitely not enough, and even if he is willing to sell the Yin-Yang Compass or the Heavenly Poisonous Silk, it is still hard to guarantee that it will be enough.
After all, anything can happen at an auction.
Apart from the few spiritual objects for refining the Pure Yang Unity Ring, the only thing he can拿出手 (show/take out) and is willing to拿出来 (show/take out) is the Blue Dewdrop.
"Can you contact the friend who has the Soul-calling Grass?" Qin Sang asked.
Elder Wen shook his head. "The rules of the auction are set by the higher-ups. If it weren't for the fact that the Taiyi Pill Pavilion has frequent dealings with the major forces in Yin Mountain Pass, and has some connections, it would not have been possible to obtain the news of the Soul-calling Grass. Apart from this news, that friend of mine dares not leak any other information, otherwise he will lose his head..."
Elder Wen pointed to his neck and made a gesture.
Qin Sang nodded slightly, he also knew that his question was a bit whimsical, and he was just asking casually.
"I wonder what Fellow Daoist Qin plans to do?"
Elder Wen took a sip of tea. "If Fellow Daoist Qin does not have time to go to Yin Mountain Pass, I can send someone to take the Soul-calling Grass for you."
Qin Sang pondered for a while, and finally shook his head and declined Elder Wen's offer. He decided to go to Yin Mountain Pass in person.
The reason why he didn't dare to run around before was because he was afraid of being caught by the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect.

Now that the Nether Shadow Sect had been destroyed and he had the Seal of Prime Origin to quell the fluctuations of the Heart-Devouring Beetle, there was nothing too worrying about making a personal visit.

Almost all the Golden Core cultivators of the Nether Shadow Sect were killed, and even if remnants of the sect at the Foundation Establishment Stage really did discover his tracks, he did not fear them with his current strength.

If he were to entrust the task to someone from the Great Unity Pill Pavilion, there was no guarantee that they would do their best, and the price could not be controlled. If the item bought was too expensive, that would be an unnecessary loss. He did not have the spare funds to spend recklessly.

He should personally attend the occasion so he could adapt to any situation.

Qin Sang then asked Elder Wen for guidance on the auction rules, and discovered that the auction would be flexible, not prohibiting bidders from trading with one another.

Bidders could exchange with each other during the bidding process, each taking what they needed and reaching mutually beneficial outcomes.

In this process, treasures could generally be exchanged for a satisfactory price, at the very least ensuring that they would not be undervalued by the auction house.

There was all the more need for him to attend in person.

After talking with Elder Wen for a while longer, Qin Sang bid farewell to Elder Wen and left the Great Unity Pill Pavilion.

There was still a year until the auction began, so Qin Sang decided to first return to the Tianjing Secret Realm to cultivate for a period of time to earn some more Spirit Stones and set off again when the auction was nearing its commencement.

Great changes were imminent, and time was of the essence. Every moment could not be wasted.

He could improve his strength by even a little. If he could break through the late Foundation Establishment realm before the war came, or even reach the False Core realm, his chances of survivability would undoubtedly increase greatly.

At this moment, Wandering Daoist still had not left seclusion.

Qin Sang returned the cave abode to the sect. By then, Senior Brother Rong had taken over the affairs of the Hanging Skull Pass and had made some changes to Qi Yuanchou’s arrangements. Qin Sang and the others cooperated with Senior Brother Rong to finalize the arrangements, then bade farewell to their fellow disciples and departed from the Hanging Skull Pass and entered the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.

With his mid Foundation Establishment cultivation, returning to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, Qin Sang clearly felt that his mindset was much more relaxed. Some of the dangers that he had previously feared, he could now easily handle with his current strength.

Riding his sword, he sped forward, hardly stopping along the way, until he reached the Changyang Market Town.
