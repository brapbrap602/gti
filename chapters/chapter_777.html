<h1>Chapter 769: Infernal Fire</h1><p>Chapter 769: Infernal Fire</p><p>Qin Sang's burst of speed left the ferocious beasts far behind.  </p><p>Soon, the pack was out of sight, including their leader, who lost Qin Sang's trail and wandered the chasm, roaring in frustration.</p><p>Having shaken off the beasts, Qin Sang dared not linger. He fled, constantly watching his rear, until all sound ceased.  Then he found a concealed crevice to hide in.</p><p>Although he only heard roars, even from this distance the sounds sent a surge of qi and blood through him. The creatures, even if not as strong as a transformed great demon, could have easily defeated the young man he'd just killed.</p><p>The chasm's depths were truly dangerous, concealing who-knows-how-many similar beasts.</p><p>Hidden in the crevice, Qin Sang remained vigilant. After listening to the outside sounds for a while, he checked on the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>Twice spitting out the seven-colored silk had greatly exhausted the silkworm, leaving it listless and drowsy.</p><p>Still, the Fat Silkworm looked at Qin Sang expectantly, eager to devour the purple crystal.</p><p>"We'll eat it after we leave the Seven Killing Hall. Eat this for now."</p><p>Qin Sang produced a venomous beast's demon core for the silkworm to absorb and recover.</p><p>Before, in the Bear Mountain region and Red Leaf Island, after consuming the Thousand-Hand Spider fruit and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, absorbing the thunder, the silkworm had immediately fallen asleep—one instance leading to a transformation, the other a mutation.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare feed the silkworm the purple crystal here; if it fell asleep, he'd be done for.</p><p>On this trip to the Purple Mist Wasteland, the Fat Silkworm's role had truly been revealed, far exceeding expectations.</p><p>It might be even more useful later, so he'd definitely wait until they left the Seven Killing Hall and returned to safety before feeding it and observing the changes.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm hugged the demon core and glared at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang twitched at the silkworm's dismissive look.</p><p>That was a demon core!</p><p>And it was just food for this guy, who was still disdainful.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to give it a good beating, but seeing their surroundings, he decided to hold back.</p><p>As the Fat Silkworm absorbed the demon core and its energy recovered, Qin Sang paid attention to the outside. After waiting a while, seeing that the leader hadn't followed, he cautiously went out.</p><p>His escape had brought him almost back to his landing point.</p><p>Returning to his previous route, Qin Sang continued his search for the spirit fire. This time, he was more cautious, fearing an encounter with the beasts searching for him, stopping every few steps, always ready to flee.</p><p>The Nine Nether Infernal Fire in his hand trembled violently, growing more excited, indicating that the unknown spirit fire was getting closer.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed he was once again at the foot of a cliff, unsure if it was the same one where the beasts lived.</p><p>The chasm's terrain was very complex.</p><p>The direction indicated by the Nine Nether Infernal Fire seemed to be along the cliff.</p><p>Qin Sang clung to the cliff, watching both sides and guarding against beasts above. Fortunately, he proceeded smoothly.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly stopped.</p><p>He found two cliffs converging before him, forming a narrow canyon.  Purple mist still filled the area ahead, obscuring the view.</p><p>"The chasm has such unusual formations? This place is ideal for a nest.  Could the spirit fire be hidden in some ancient temple or forbidden area, guarded by ferocious beasts?"</p><p>Qin Sang suspected as much, feeling a premonition of danger. He stared ahead for a while, hearing nothing.</p><p>Since he was here, he'd go on.</p><p>Qin Sang steeled himself, gripping his Ten Directions Yanluo Banner, and slowly walked forward.</p><p>The canyon wasn't wide, and it grew narrower the further he went.</p><p>After walking a distance, Qin Sang paused slightly, his eyes widening in shock. Then he suddenly sped up, rushing forward.</p><p>…</p><p>Between the cliffs, a black flame floated in the canyon, blocking his path.</p><p>Qin Sang stood there, looking up at the flame.</p><p>"Nine Nether Infernal Fire! It's actually Nine Nether Infernal Fire! The Seven Killing Hall also has Nine Nether Infernal Fire! No wonder…"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, his expression shifting from shock to enlightenment and finally, ecstatic joy.</p><p>No wonder the Nine Nether Infernal Fire behaved so differently on Cold Flame Island. This spirit fire was clearly of the same origin as his, their auras identical.</p><p>This wasn't the superficial control Qin Sang achieved through the Ten Directions Yama Banner, but the true essence of demonic fire!</p><p>Years ago, Kui Yin Old Ancestor encountered the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire in Ziwei Palace.  He painstakingly refined the demonic banner to subdue it, subsequently dominating the Xiaohan region.</p><p>Qin Sang, upon learning this secret, had been envious.</p><p>Later, Kui Yin Old Ancestor and his successors searched Ziwei Palace and the Ancient Immortal Battlefield for a long time, but never found another such demon fire. This resulted in irreparable damage to their sect's treasure.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he now saw it in the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Moreover, this Nine Netherworld Demon Fire was even larger than the one Kui Yin Old Ancestor had subdued!</p><p>Standing there, sensing the true power of the demonic fire, Qin Sang finally understood Kui Yin Old Ancestor's obsession.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire burned silently.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened as he sensed its power.</p><p>Previously, he only had secondhand knowledge through soul-searching Yi Tiannie, lacking firsthand experience of the demon fire's might.</p><p>Its seemingly calm surface concealed a power as violent as volcanic magma.</p><p>Qin Sang had no doubt that unleashing its true power would instantly obliterate him.</p><p>He instinctively compared it to the Yuan Ying masters he'd encountered, finding it far surpassed even the terrifying power of Chifa Old Ancestor and Zhenyi Daoist—both peak mid-Yuan Ying stage cultivators, a single step from the late stage!</p><p>Kui Yin Old Ancestor, using the Ten Directions Yama Array, could only utilize a fraction of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's power, yet it propelled him to the peak of the Xiaohan region.</p><p>"Such terrifying power... can I really subdue it?"</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, self-doubt creeping in.</p><p>Suppressing his excitement, he flipped his hand, revealing a black iron pillar.</p><p>This pillar was a trophy from the battle that killed Jiupao Daoist, and a prized possession of the Kui Yin Sect. The shaft of the Ten Directions Yama Banner was forged from another such pillar.</p><p>If the Kui Yin Sect had found the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, they would have long since created a new Ten Directions Yama Banner, repairing the array.</p><p>After being gravely injured, Jiupao Daoist had attempted to use it to refine a lifebound treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang later obtained it, studying it for a long time, discovering it was impossible.  Kui Yin Old Ancestor had merely cleverly refined it without destroying the inherent restrictions of the black iron, leaving it untouched.</p><p>Qin Sang never expected to witness the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>"Such a large mass of Nine Netherworld Demon Fire… even if I melt the entire iron pillar into the Ten Directions Yama Banner, it would be enough for fifteen or sixteen banners…"</p><p>Qin Sang examined the black iron pillar, analyzing it.</p><p>His eyes widened.  "Doesn't that mean I have a chance to create a stronger array than the original Ten Directions Yama Array!"</p><p>The original Ten Directions Yama Array, with ten demonic banners, could withstand a direct blow from a top-grade treasure.</p><p>If he successfully refined more banners and developed a suitable array, he'd possess the power of a top-grade treasure!</p>
