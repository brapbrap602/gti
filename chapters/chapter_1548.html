<h1>Chapter 1539: The Relic (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1539: The Relic (4k)</p><p>Only one venerable remained at the Zhurlan Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli, after deliberation, decided to take it by force!</p><p>Liuli used the Moonlight Bodhisattva to pique Venerable Chengyuan's interest, luring him to the front temple while secretly deploying the Ice Soul Radiance.</p><p>The Ice Soul Radiance, formless and intangible, is one of the most effective ambush techniques in the cultivation world.</p><p>Liuli concealed the technique, and Venerable Chengyuan, despite controlling the temple's protective formation, detected nothing unusual about Liuli.</p><p>When Venerable Chengyuan appeared,</p><p>Liuli, without a word, attacked.</p><p>The Ice Soul Radiance suddenly activated!</p><p>‘Ka-ka!’</p><p>A sound of freezing abruptly echoed in the void.</p><p>Immediately, the sound was drowned out by Venerable Chengyuan's roar.</p><p>However, by the time he heard the sound and noticed something amiss, he had already fallen victim.</p><p>Without warning, the void around Venerable Chengyuan solidified.  Having moved from the cliff face, he had essentially walked into a trap, placing himself within the Ice Soul Radiance.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan hadn't anticipated anyone being so audacious as to attack within the Zhurlan Temple.</p><p>Relying on the protective formation, he could exert power beyond his actual cultivation level!</p><p>Blue light burst forth.</p><p>A chilling aura pressed down.</p><p>Ice formed spontaneously in the void, rapidly spreading.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan's figure appeared within the ice.  His face, contorted with rage, showed deeper wrinkles, but the ice distorted his features, making him look somewhat comical.</p><p>Liuli unleashed the Ice Soul Radiance to its full extent.  Taking advantage of his surprise, Venerable Chengyuan indeed fell prey.</p><p>Inside the ice, the cold air visibly spread, closing in to engulf Venerable Chengyuan.</p><p>If sealed by the Ice Soul Radiance, Venerable Chengyuan would be at their mercy.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Thin ice coated Venerable Chengyuan's kasaya.</p><p>The chill had pierced his protective true energy, invading his body.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan's escape seemed impossible!</p><p>While the situation appeared critical, Venerable Chengyuan showed no sign of panic.</p><p>His opponent possessed high cultivation and exceptional abilities, but hadn't chosen the right time or place.</p><p>Unless the opponent could somehow disrupt the protective formation or sever Venerable Chengyuan's control over it, this technique couldn't pose a fatal threat.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan believed that a cultivator of this level couldn't be stupid; surely she had considered the influence of the protective formation?</p><p>If she did this, there must be a reason!</p><p>As the crisis loomed, Venerable Chengyuan calmly analyzed the situation.</p><p>The Zhurlan Temple, allied with the six major temples, controlled seven oases in the vast sea, expelling other forces, and had indeed made many enemies, but none that included this nun.</p><p>There was no animosity between them.</p><p>Her intentions didn't seem to be to kill him.</p><p>Suddenly, a thought struck Venerable Chengyuan.</p><p>“The Sutra Pavilion! The Treasury!”</p><p>She was bait!</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan instantly understood.  The nun's accomplices must be hidden within the Zhurlan Temple!</p><p>She wasn't seeking revenge; she was luring him to the front temple to cooperate with her accomplices in stealing treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli's plan was indeed simple, never expecting to conceal it from Venerable Chengyuan's eyes.</p><p>However, even though Venerable Chengyuan saw through their intentions, his first thought was of the Sutra Pavilion, which housed secret techniques and scriptures, and the treasury.</p><p>Who could have imagined their target was actually the stupa field where the remains of past high monks were enshrined?</p><p>“Insignificant villains!”</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan flew into a rage. A buzzing sound emanated from within him, like a great bell resonating through the Zhurlan Temple, causing a tremor in everyone's hearts.</p><p>Intense Buddhist light surged from Venerable Chengyuan, faintly revealing the phantom of a bronze bell, engraved with thirteen horizontal lines, each space between them depicting Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.</p><p>The bronze bell phantom burst from his body. The ice shards on Venerable Chengyuan instantly shattered, but the Ice Soul Radiance wasn't so easily broken. The hastily formed bell phantom quickly frosted over, then cracked, on the verge of shattering.</p><p>However, the time bought by the bronze bell phantom was enough for Venerable Chengyuan to reactivate the formation and escape!</p><p>“Return to the mountain, close the temple!”</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan’s shout echoed throughout the Zhurlan Temple.</p><p>The Zhurlan Temple monks, hearing the roar and the sounds, were still confused about what had happened. Panic-stricken, they heard their master’s order and rushed towards the rear mountain.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan disappeared before Liuli.</p><p>The Ice Soul Radiance fell on empty space.</p><p>Liuli had anticipated this, ignoring the frightened temple administrator, glanced at the stupa field on the rear mountain, and instead of retreating, advanced, darting towards the mountain.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan appeared above the scripture library.</p><p>The temple treasures were of utmost importance.</p><p>Therefore, without waiting for the outcome of his fight with Liuli, Venerable Chengyuan decisively retreated to the back mountain, preventing thieves from exploiting the chaos to steal the treasures.</p><p>The scripture library was located on the mountaintop, with the treasury adjacent to it.</p><p>Upon appearing, Venerable Chengyuan flicked his sleeve, and a golden ray shot out, emitting a piercing, sword-like shriek as it soared into the sky and burst apart at high altitude.</p><p>Instantly, golden clouds spread layer upon layer, bathing the land in Buddha's light, resembling the scenes of Buddha's arrival depicted in scriptures.</p><p>The golden light and clouds were visible to all the people in the oasis. Devout Buddhists were ecstatic, prostrating themselves and praising the Buddha.</p><p>This was actually a signal used by Venerable Chengyuan to alert others. The six great monasteries in other oases could also see the celestial phenomenon and would come to reinforce.</p><p>It had been a long time since this signal had been used since the seven monasteries formed an alliance.</p><p>While sending the signal, Venerable Chengyuan quickly scanned the area below.</p><p>His reaction was swift, yet the result was unexpected.  Everything around the scripture library was normal; no intruders were found.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan was startled.</p><p>He had anticipated at least one accomplice of the nun from Zhulan Temple, possibly more, to be lurking inside. Otherwise, they wouldn't have dared to be so brazen!</p><p>The enemy was in the dark, he was in the light.  Being targeted by a mysterious Yuan Ying cultivator, someone who clearly had long planned this, Venerable Chengyuan felt a strong sense of foreboding and immediately issued the warning.</p><p>Unexpectedly, no one had infiltrated the site.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>A tremendous explosion came from the pagoda forest, demonic fire erupting into the sky!</p><p>…</p><p>At noon.</p><p>The sun was high, the sky clear.</p><p>The intense sunlight fell upon the pagoda forest, yet failed to dispel its chilling atmosphere.</p><p>As Liuli launched her attack, Qin Sang began his own operation.</p><p>Within Zhulan Temple, the pagoda forest, where the remains of past masters were enshrined, held a superior position and enjoyed significant protection.</p><p>However, it only housed earthly objects; the defenses couldn't be as tight as the scripture library's, otherwise Qin Sang would face greater difficulty.</p><p>With the Sky-Eyed Butterfly assisting, breaking this protective barrier wasn't particularly challenging.</p><p>The pagoda forest's barrier had long been etched in Qin Sang's mind, having been mentally practiced countless times.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly appeared at the edge of the pagoda forest. Before him lay an invisible barrier.</p><p>Confident in Liuli's abilities, he didn't overthink it.  His mind was clear, focused on the barrier.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's pupils appeared somewhat dilated, as his mind was connected to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, fully activating his celestial eye ability.</p><p>In the Butterfly's 'vision,' the barrier materialized, the void ahead transforming into a golden net.</p><p>Golden threads crisscrossed, forming a dense net enveloping the pagoda forest.  The net extended outwards, ultimately vanishing into the void, merging with the temple's protective formation.</p><p>Only during grand Buddhist festivals would the three Venerables open the pagoda forest.</p><p>Ordinarily, the monks guarding the pagodas wouldn't dare disturb the past masters and lacked the knowledge to open it.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted.</p><p>His spiritual sense surged from his Purple Mansion.</p><p>The Fire Lotus also flew out from his forehead, guided by his spiritual sense, separating into gentle strands of demonic fire, slowly drifting towards the 'golden net.'</p><p>The demonic fire lightly attached itself to the 'golden net.'</p><p>Qin Sang's control over the demonic fire was impeccable, selecting key points of the barrier—locations determined after countless simulations.</p><p>Silently, the demonic fire began to integrate into the 'golden net.'</p><p>Qin Sang remained focused, not daring to be distracted.</p><p>This step was the most crucial part of the entire plan.</p><p>At this moment, Venerable Chengyuan, having just been ambushed by Liuli, would certainly have reacted and gone to protect the scripture library.</p><p>Should Qin Sang make a mistake and draw Venerable Chengyuan to the pagoda forest prematurely, the entire operation would likely fail.</p><p>The golden threads on the net appeared to gradually darken, replaced by black, while the actual process of breaking the barrier was breathtaking, demanding significant mental exertion from Qin Sang.</p><p>He hadn't directly breached a passage in the barrier, as doing so would inevitably alarm Venerable Chengyuan.</p><p>His plan was cautious: to weaken several key points of the barrier, reducing its defensive strength to a certain point, then make a final push into the pagoda forest, leaving no chance for Venerable Chengyuan to intervene.</p><p>By the time Venerable Chengyuan appeared above the scripture library and the golden clouds filled the sky,</p><p>the golden net seemed to rot, revealing several unsightly black patches.</p><p>Throughout, the disciples responsible for guarding the protective formation had not detected Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted, his eyes shining brightly, and he suddenly raised his hand to press against the 'golden net.'</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The demonic banner flew swiftly, demonic flames forming in an instant. Qin Sang's arm muscles bulged as a demonic fire dragon coiled around his arm, combining with a powerful punch to smash against the golden net.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A deafening roar shook the Zhushe Temple.  Within the pagoda forest, the pagodas shook violently, the Buddha light atop each flickering erratically.</p><p>A gap tore open in the barrier!</p><p>Amidst the swirling demonic flames, a figure darted into the pagoda forest, heading straight for one of the pagodas.</p><p>Zhushe Temple's pagodas were built from a yellow ore, said to be unavailable in the瀚海 region; the monks brought it from their homeland when they relocated.</p><p>The pagodas varied in height but were uniformly arranged and shaped – all hexagonal, single-eaved pagodas. The number of levels, ranging from five to nine, reflected the contribution of the monk whose relics were enshrined within.</p><p>The pagoda containing the relics of Venerable Hongyi, with its nine eaves, was one of the most impressive in the forest.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Qin Sang appeared atop the pagoda. The relics were within his grasp.</p><p>Even with his composure, a smile played on his lips. Without hesitation, he reached into the Buddha light, grasping for the relics.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A furious shout rang from above.  A shadow appeared above the pagoda forest; Venerable Chengyuan, sensing the disturbance, had arrived, but too late to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>The relics felt smooth and cool, like a precious jewel.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the relics, didn't even look up, and immediately retreated. Simultaneously, his spiritual energy coalesced in his palm, forming a phantom sigil that enveloped the relics, adhering to their surface before vanishing instantly.</p><p>This was a secret technique taught by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>If, by misfortune, the relics were fake, he would have to fight Venerable Chengyuan, and forcefully raid the scripture library and treasury.  After today, the Zhushe Temple would be on high alert; there would be no better opportunity.</p><p>As the sigil disappeared, Qin Sang immediately sensed the relics' extraordinary nature, perceiving a strange power within them through the sigil.  This power lay dormant; even if Qin Sang had obtained the relics, he would have overlooked it without Xiao Xiangzi’s guidance.  No wonder the Zhushe Temple hadn’t noticed anything.</p><p>“It’s real!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart leaped with joy.  Just as he was about to withdraw his spiritual energy and leave, he ‘heard’ a faint sound.</p><p>Something seemed to crack.</p><p>He didn’t hear it with his ears, but perceived it through his spiritual sense, emanating from within the relics!</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang’s expression tightened.</p><p>For some reason, the relics in his hand suddenly became intensely hot. It was as if a seal had been present, inadvertently broken by Qin Sang’s probing, and the power within was now active, even erupting!</p><p>This was something Xiao Xiangzi hadn't mentioned – a complete surprise.  Qin Sang hadn’t performed the complete refinement technique, only the initial part to sense the power’s existence before stopping. Logically, the relics shouldn't be reacting this way.</p><p>In Qin Sang’s perception, the relics weren't originally a single, unified entity.</p><p>Remembering the relics' creation, Qin Sang suddenly understood, vaguely guessing the reason.  Initially, Venerable Hongyi had failed in his attempt to break through using a magical artifact, dying in the process. The external ‘seal’ was likely formed from Venerable Hongyi's essence upon his passing, fusing with the artifact's remaining power, thus sealing and preserving it.</p><p>As the years passed, the ‘seal’ gradually weakened, becoming increasingly fragile.  That's why Qin Sang’s slight probing touched upon the power, causing the relics' anomaly; the ‘seal’ couldn't contain the artifact's power any longer, and it began to revive after years of dormancy.</p><p>Even without Qin Sang, as time went on, the imbalance within the relics would have led to the artifact's power erupting.</p><p>For Qin Sang, it was an unexpected crisis.</p><p>Elsewhere, he could immediately meditate and refine the relics.  Doing so within the Zhushe Temple was akin to suicide.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly; his spiritual energy surged into his palm, layer upon layer enveloping the relics, yet unable to stop the power's eruption.</p><p>He wouldn't simply wait for death; his mind raced, activating the fire lotus to construct a demonic fire seal.</p><p>Fortunately, the relics’ ‘seal’ hadn’t completely broken; Qin Sang’s actions worked, temporarily stabilizing the ‘seal’, but it would only buy him time. He needed to escape and find a place to refine them.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>At this moment, Venerable Chengyuan's gaze shifted from Qin Sang to his palm, perceiving the relics' fluctuations.  He understood immediately: Venerable Hongyi's relics were a magical artifact; it was laughable that the Zhushe Temple had worshipped them for so long without knowing.</p><p>The thieves had sent two Yuan Ying mid-stage experts – such a significant effort suggested the relics' value far surpassed expectations.</p><p>“Thus have I heard,”</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan clasped his hands together, his voice low.  Using some unknown technique, his bones cracked, and his aura surged explosively!</p>
