<h1>Chapter 1414: Final Appearance</h1><p>Traveling between the radiant glow and the crimson flames.</p><p>At intervals, an attack would appear.</p><p>The spirit array conjured weapons, each different from the last.</p><p>There were staffs, alms bowls, as well as golden swords and knives.</p><p>These weapons, while menacing, shared a common weakness. Qin Sang could easily evade them with timely dodges.</p><p>The journey was uneventful.</p><p>Guided by the Fire Jade Centipede, Qin Sang sped forward.</p><p>Throughout this, Qin Sang remained vigilant. With the Sky Eye Butterfly's assistance, he focused on analyzing the spirit array.</p><p>Having thoroughly studied the Yuan Shen Sect classics, he possessed some understanding of formations and prohibitions.</p><p>Although this was a Buddhist array, certain principles were universal.</p><p>However, being within the array, he only saw the tip of the iceberg, unaware of the array's full scope.  He couldn't devise a way to break it in a short time, so he could only follow its course.</p><p>As time passed, Qin Sang's understanding of the array deepened, and the moment to break it drew near!</p><p>As he moved forward,</p><p>Qin Sang increasingly marveled at the array's sophistication.</p><p>Aside from the Zi Wei Palace, the Seven Killing Hall, and other places with those incomprehensible immortal prohibitions, this spirit array was the most complex and grand he had ever encountered. The array's creator possessed unimaginable mastery of the art of formations.</p><p>He raced continuously for several hours, yet the end was still nowhere in sight.</p><p>Adding to the time spent in the first layer of the array,</p><p>by now, a full half-day had passed since they entered the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>The array's coverage couldn't possibly be that vast. It could only be explained that the array's creator cleverly confined those who dared to enter within a limited space.</p><p>That such a powerful figure existed within the Buddhist sect yet remained unknown was a mystery.</p><p>Along the way, he saw no sign of Master Mu, the Hun Mo Elder, or the others.</p><p>Qin Sang ceased to ponder.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed that the frequency of the attacks was increasing.</p><p>He braced himself, not slowing but accelerating his pace.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Not far from there, Qin Sang abruptly stopped, his pupils contracting.</p><p>Before him stood a Buddha statue, blocking his path.</p><p>Unlike the Thousand Buddha Wall, this was a single, towering Buddha, with twenty-four heads and eighteen arms, each wielding a golden sword, umbrella, staff, lotus, alms bowl, or other Buddhist treasures.</p><p>The attacks Qin Sang had encountered were all emanating from this statue.</p><p>The statue, too, was not spared from the crimson flames, its body a mixture of gold and red.</p><p>The eighteen Buddhist hands' weapons were condensed from the spirit array's power. Golden light gathered, gradually solidifying before Qin Sang, and then launching their attacks.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed closer.</p><p>The Buddha statue glared with wrathful eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened, and he hastily dodged sideways.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Two weapons flew from the Buddha's hands, both aimed at Qin Sang. Fortunately, he was alert, or he might have been injured.</p><p>The attacks grew more frequent and violent.</p><p>Qin Sang responded calmly, his gaze fixed on the statue. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. He flung out his magic banner, his phoenix wings flapping rapidly, transforming into a streak of green light, striking the Buddha statue with lightning speed.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The fire dragon struck the statue's forehead.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>A deafening roar echoed. The statue's movements abruptly froze, then began to shatter from its forehead.</p><p>In an instant, the entire statue collapsed, revealing a swirling vortex of crimson and gold.</p><p>Before the crimson flames erupted, Qin Sang hesitated not a moment, charging into the vortex.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>In a flash, the scenery shifted again.</p><p>Seeing the completely different surroundings, Qin Sang knew he had entered the third transformation. He rubbed his temples wearily.  "At this rate, I don't know how many more days it will take to find the array's weakness. If this drags on, more Yuan Ying stage cultivators will be drawn here, and things will become increasingly chaotic."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, took a moment to adjust his breath, summoned the Fire Jade Centipede, found his direction, and set off again.</p><p>And so it went.</p><p>Time slipped away.</p><p>Qin Sang charged through the spirit array, witnessing various Buddhist techniques, his understanding of Buddhism deepening – a case of misfortune turning into good fortune, perhaps.</p><p>Unknowingly, Qin Sang had spent nearly five days there.</p><p>During these days,</p><p>Qin Sang was constantly harried by the array’s ever-changing nature.  However, he rarely encountered true danger.</p><p>Without the pressure from Hun Mo Elder and the others, the four of them could have calmly broken the array, albeit with the expenditure of more time.</p><p>Day and night blurred within the array.</p><p>At this moment,</p><p>Qin Sang found himself standing on a path paved with golden bricks.</p><p>The path hung in mid-air, stretching out into the distance.</p><p>He sat cross-legged in meditation.</p><p>His Yuan Ying spirit puppet stood guard beside him, ready to counter any attack that might appear.</p><p>Qin Sang had just taken a few pills and was in the process of refining them.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, refreshed and full of energy.  Confidence shone in his eyes.  Five days of relentless exploration had allowed him to understand most of the spirit array's patterns, enough to break it.  Moreover, he was now very close to the array's core.</p><p>Glancing down at the golden brick path, Qin Sang stood up and dashed forward. He stopped abruptly, located a node in the array, and repeated his earlier tactic, summoning the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire. The flames hovered before him.  Without pausing, he retrieved a set of array instruments from his Qianjun Ring. He had refined these before leaving the Yuanshen Sect; their power was somewhat lacking, but they could serve as a supplementary tool.  Qin Sang rapidly changed hand seals, deploying the instruments around himself.  Pausing slightly, he looked down at the golden bricks and pressed his hands forcefully downwards.</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>The instruments trembled, and a yellowish-brown light coalesced into a stone spear, which plunged downwards.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Golden light radiated outwards. The path shattered. The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire followed closely, surging downwards.  In an instant, a rich reddish-gold light erupted, and the demon banner billowed.  Qin Sang narrowed his eyes. His vision was filled with chaos; he felt the spirit array's power becoming extremely disordered, powerful waves surging from all around as the array fought back.  His expression remained unchanged as he suddenly plummeted downwards.</p><p>…</p><p>This was a purplish-red space.  Purple flames filled the sky.  These purple flames were the ultimate manifestation of concentrated Fiery Inferno energy.  Streams of purple fire moved through the void like dragons, radiating terrifying power.  The higher up, the denser the flames became, obscuring the sky entirely. Below lay a barren landscape.  The area was not vast, smaller even than Hundred Flowers Valley, with only two mountain ranges intersecting at their highest peak.  There were traces of rivers between the mountains, but all were now dried up.  A pillar of fire erupted from the summit of the highest peak, with Fiery Inferno energy constantly flowing out, merging with and strengthening the purple flames.  Scattered golden lights could be seen across this land. Golden-topped buildings stood on mountain peaks, and golden Buddhist pagodas shone brightly.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang finally escaped the spirit array. Carefully avoiding the floating flames, he looked down at the strange scene below.</p><p>"This is the Jinghai Sect?" he muttered to himself.</p><p>He looked around.  There wasn't a single person in sight; the Jinghai Sect was eerily silent, its Buddhist disciples vanished without a trace.  He also saw no sign of the Hunmo Elder, Mu Valley Master, or others.  It seemed he was the first to enter this place.</p>
