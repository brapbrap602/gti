<h1>Chapter 1690: Shared Heart</h1><p>The avatar, carrying Qin Sang's true body, escaped from Emperor Bestowal Mountain and had just entered the sword formation when a prickling sensation, like needles on his back, arose. Looking up, he saw demonic Qi billowing in the distance; the demon horde had arrived!</p><p>Leading the charge was a white figure, grotesque and humanoid in shape, with slender limbs and long, thin fingers. It resembled a mountain魈 or倀ghost, a demonic specter wreathed in swirling white smoke, seemingly formed from Yin souls and ghostly Qi, intensifying the eerie and terrifying aura.</p><p>Wherever the white figure passed, the very light of day seemed to dim.</p><p>This white figure was the true form of Great Sage Bai Xiao. To carry out the Holy King's command, he had directly revealed his demonic body. On either side of him were two demon kings skilled in遁 techniques, with the rest of the demon kings following close behind.</p><p>One was a fleshless bone bird, a few withered yellow feathers clinging to the edges of its wings, tucked between its bones. The other was a four-winged blood serpent with crimson scales.</p><p>All were monstrous demons of bizarre appearances.</p><p>The gaze the avatar felt was precisely from Bai Xiao. Sharp eyes locked onto Qin Sang and his avatar. Bai Xiao had personally witnessed them escape into the sword formation and wouldn't let them escape so easily.</p><p>Bai Xiao let out a cold, harsh laugh. He forcefully churned his arms, and the white smoke surrounding him, drawn by some unseen force, rapidly converged, ultimately forming a slender bone sword before him.</p><p>The four-winged blood serpent and the bone bird, having followed Bai Xiao for many years, understood his intentions. One spat out a blood pearl, while the other vibrated its bony wings, shooting out three demonic feathers.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Three attacks were launched simultaneously.</p><p>Three streams of light appeared above the sword peak: one white, one yellow, and one crimson, as fast as lightning.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Azure light erupted skyward above the sword peak.</p><p>The grand formation, recently breached by Qin Sang, immediately began to violently shake. The blood pearl and demonic feathers reached the formation before the bone sword, colliding head-on. Blood-red light, murky yellow light, and azure light burst forth simultaneously, causing the earth to tremble.</p><p>The bone sword followed close behind, its timing impeccable. It precisely located a weak point in the formation, trailing a long plume of white smoke as it hurtled downwards like a comet.</p><p>The avatar felt a stinging sensation all over his body, as if locked onto by a true blade. His expression hardened slightly, and he swung his arm back, transforming icy white Qi into a long river that spread out behind him.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>The bone sword plunged into the river of icy Qi.</p><p>No ripples appeared.</p><p>The next moment, Bai Xiao's expression froze. The bone sword had inexplicably vanished. He hadn't felt any impact from the collision, a bizarre occurrence that filled him with shock and fury.</p><p>Unbeknownst to others, as the Ice Soul Divine Light was unleashed, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly perched on the avatar's shoulder spread its wings, shooting out a beam of Heaven's Eye Divine Light.</p><p>The bone sword, formed from divine power and launched from afar, melted upon contact with the Heaven's Eye Divine Light.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was eager to find a place to heal and didn't want to tangle with Bai Xiao. The Ice Soul Divine Light not only concealed the Heaven's Eye Divine Light but also shielded his movements.</p><p>Taking advantage of the icy Qi's cover, the avatar glanced around, burrowed into the ground, and his figure flickered, rapidly traversing between the sword peaks.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>An unnamed sword peak.</p><p>The avatar, carrying Qin Sang's true body, crashed into a valley.</p><p>A fierce wind swept through, snapping vegetation and leaving a trail of destruction. A clear spring flowed through the valley, and beside it stood a simple wooden hut, likely the dwelling of a sword cultivator, now undoubtedly abandoned.</p><p>The avatar hastily set down Qin Sang's true body. His injuries were worsening, the repercussions of consuming two Boiling Snow Pills now manifesting.</p><p>Ordinarily, a Grand Cultivator would need to heal immediately after taking even one Boiling Snow Pill. Damage to the meridians and Qi Sea was only part of it. The influx of immense, foreign spiritual energy, without any buffer, directly impacted one's Dao Foundation. Any delay risked destabilizing the foundation itself.</p><p>Qin Sang had relied entirely on his robust physical body and exceptionally powerful divine sense, far surpassing those of his peers, to stabilize his body and Dao Foundation, enduring the onslaught.</p><p>In reality, the spiritual energy within Qin Sang's true body hadn't been completely depleted, and the pills' medicinal power hadn't fully dissipated.  The combined effect of two Boiling Snow Pills left some residue.</p><p>But this remaining energy was more detrimental than beneficial.  Qin Sang's true body could no longer control it and was using all its strength to prevent the injuries from worsening, unable to divide its attention.</p><p>To make matters worse, the toxins within his body were stirring, taking advantage of his weakness. Although the poison-repelling halo from the antidote pill offered some protection, it relied on Qin Sang's ability to suppress the toxins himself.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was ashen, his brows furrowed deeply, his breath weak and erratic.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly flapped its wings, taking flight from the avatar. Its divine ability had allowed them to quickly decipher the Golden Aspect Hall's formation's intricacies.</p><p>It landed on Qin Sang's shoulder, its soft wings gently brushing his cheek. As if sensing his pain, the butterfly's wings trembled, and a faint blue mist emanated from the Heaven's Eye patterns.</p><p>The avatar flashed behind Qin Sang's true body, placing a hand on his back.  Being one and the same, Qin Sang could trust the avatar's power to enter his body and help regulate his spiritual energy.</p><p>With the avatar's assistance, Qin Sang's internal condition improved somewhat.</p><p>The pain on his face lessened, but his injuries remained severe. The avatar continued to work diligently, hastily grabbing several bottles of healing pills and stuffing them into Qin Sang's true body.</p><p>Just then, the ground began to shake violently.</p><p>Looking up, demon shadows hovered in the air.</p><p>Bai Xiao and the two other demons hung in the sky, their gazes sharp as lightning. They quickly discovered the situation. The four-winged blood serpent let out a shrill cry, its blood-red light flashing as it appeared above the sword peak, its long tail whipping out fiercely.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Blood-red light exploded, the violent impact creating a spiritual energy hurricane even through the sword formation. The force rebounded towards the sword peak, completely plowing through the valley.</p><p>The wooden hut collapsed, exposing the earth and rocks beneath.</p><p>Qin Sang was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Sensing the danger, Qin Sang had escaped the valley in advance, suppressing his aura and seemingly fleeing randomly like a headless fly. In reality, he relied on his understanding of the sword formation and the Heaven's Eye divine ability, following the formation's flow.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>...</p><p>The booming sounds continued to echo.</p><p>Tracking through the grand formation was difficult. The demon kings bombarded the area indiscriminately. Bai Xiao, the four-winged blood serpent, and the bone bird took turns attacking, forcing Qin Sang to keep moving.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang gained a general understanding of the nearby formation's changes and unexpectedly sensed a hidden location, quickly escaping into it.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A long-absent ray of light entered the dark underground palace.</p><p>Apparently, the original owner had cut corners. The underground palace's restrictions were linked to the protective mountain formation, their networks intertwined, utilizing the formation's power. Because of this, Qin Sang could easily enter.</p><p>The furnishings within the palace were simple, suggesting it wasn't a place of great importance.</p><p>With a rare moment of respite, the avatar continued to regulate Qin Sang's spiritual energy, but his heart grew heavier with each passing moment. Qin Sang's true body's condition was more troublesome than anticipated.</p><p>The gains from this trip to the Formless Immortal Sect were considerable, far exceeding Qin Sang's expectations, provided he survived to enjoy them. Otherwise, it was all for naught.</p><p>The depletion of True Essence wasn't a major issue. Without Boiling Snow Pills, he still had top-grade spirit stones.</p><p>During the confrontation with the Holy King, the avatar hadn't had a chance to act, slowly recovering True Essence by consuming other pills. The top-grade spirit stones were reserved for Qin Sang's true body, which could absorb their spiritual energy once his condition stabilized.</p><p>But now, the problem wasn't True Essence. Without first suppressing the injuries, Qin Sang's true body couldn't act.</p><p>The avatar alone, even with the Sun God Tree, could repel a demonic Great Sage, but how could it withstand the siege of numerous demon kings?  Moreover, they could easily surround and wait, continuously wearing him down until the Azure Fox Holy King was free to act.</p><p>Now, he could only rely on the grand formation to evade them. He didn't know if he could hold on until Qin Sang's true body recovered.</p><p>"The true body or the avatar… must I abandon one?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought bitterly.</p><p>When the time came to make a choice, if possible, he would prioritize the survival of his true body.</p><p>...</p><p>At the edge of the Golden Aspect Hall.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang flee in this direction, the old nun felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p>She didn't know how much the destruction of the three phantom bodies had affected the Azure Fox Holy King, but she absolutely didn't want to be dragged into their conflict, let alone risk incurring the wrath of a Nascent Soul cultivator. The sect's top experts were all gathered here. If they were caught in the crossfire, the consequences would be unbearable for the Hidden Moon Convent.</p><p>One could see that other cultivators, initially intending to explore the Golden Aspect Hall, had hastily scattered.</p><p>She immediately crushed the jade talisman in her hand, ordering a retreat.</p><p>Fortunately, her junior sister had sent back a message, indicating they had broken through most of the secret hall's restrictions and obtained a portion of the treasures, a bountiful harvest.</p><p>Having received the warning, they didn't dare linger, hurriedly withdrawing.</p><p>After the old nun regrouped with her junior sisters, she looked back towards the west but didn't see any trace of Liuli.</p><p>"Did she see the battle at Emperor Bestowal Mountain and take a detour?"</p><p>Just as this thought crossed her mind, a cold voice echoed from the shadows of a nearby rock formation, "Abbess."</p><p>Liuli had arrived at some point, emerging from the darkness. Not only had she not flown openly on her sword, but she was also suppressing her aura as much as possible.</p><p>Upon witnessing Qin Sang's battle with the demonic Nascent Soul cultivator, Liuli had concealed herself.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar cultivation technique came from the Listening Snow Pavilion, and the avatar also cultivated the Ice Soul Divine Light, sharing a common origin, making their auras similar to hers. If she didn't conceal herself, the demonic Nascent Soul cultivator might see through her disguise, and she would be implicated.</p><p>"Good to see you back!"</p><p>The old nun's expression softened, and she said gravely, "We can't stay here long! Though our gains fall short of expectations, this is still a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. Return and cultivate in seclusion, and your cultivation will surely advance greatly.  Know when to retreat, and don't be swayed by greed."</p><p>These words were not only directed at Liuli but also served as a warning to her other junior sisters who still harbored some reluctance.</p><p>Once the old monk suppressed the demonic being and freed himself, he would undoubtedly target them, the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect. Delaying any further was already risky.</p><p>"Such a pity! Given a little more time, we could have broken through the last sword Qi seal on that secret hall! Based on our previous findings, there are definitely sword cultivator treasures inside, extremely valuable, and perhaps even the *Taiyuan Golden Astral Sword Scripture*!"</p><p>A young nun expressed her disappointment.</p><p>"Junior Sister Ying, you must have drawn a map of the protective formation while exploring the Golden Aspect Hall, right?  Give me the map, and I'll retrieve the treasures from the secret hall," Liuli said, extending her hand.</p><p>These words surprised everyone.</p><p>The old nun waved her whisk, blocking Liuli, "Junior Sister, don't be reckless…"</p><p>Liuli interrupted the old nun, insisting, "Since joining the convent, I've received much kindness but have yet to contribute anything. The cultivation methods and techniques I practice aren't inherited from the Formless Immortal Sect, and others are unaware of my connection to the Hidden Moon Convent. I won't be targeted."</p><p>Hearing this, the others felt tempted. The young nun was especially eager, already retrieving a jade slip with an expectant expression.</p><p>The old nun remained silent, her gaze fixed on Liuli.</p><p>After a long while, she glanced back at the Golden Aspect Hall, not towards the secret hall but at the floating lake above, its surface suddenly turbulent. She then turned to a female lay disciple beside her and said, "This place is fraught with peril. We can't let Junior Sister Liuli venture alone. I'll stay and provide support. Junior Sister, take the others and leave first."</p><p>The female lay disciple was taken aback.</p><p>Before she could respond, the old nun took the jade slip from the young nun, her tone不容置疑 as she urged them to leave.</p><p>"The legacy site is crowded and full of prying eyes. Don't go to the teleportation formation yet; leave directly through the main entrance.  The other factions are either occupied with the ancient demon or busy searching for treasures and won't have the time to bother with us. There shouldn't be any obstacles, but remember not to linger."</p><p>Everyone understood that the teleportation formation was reserved for the abbess and Liuli, so they didn't object.</p><p>The young nun, a mixture of hope and worry in her voice, said, "We found several secret passages in the Golden Aspect Hall… Abbess, Senior Sister Liuli, please be careful."</p><p>The old nun's tone was stern, and with the abbess's authority, the female lay disciple didn't dare disobey. She immediately gathered her junior sisters, bid farewell to the two, concealed their auras, and flew towards the entrance of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>After watching the nuns depart, the old nun turned back, handing the jade slip to Liuli, "Have you considered the dangers within, Junior Sister?"</p><p>"Thank you, Abbess."</p><p>Liuli accepted the jade slip, aware that the abbess might have discerned something.</p><p>Her joining the Hidden Moon Convent had been a coincidence, leading to a bond with the abbess.  Apart from restrictions on leaving the convent, the rules were lax. The abbess could also guide her in understanding Buddhist principles, which she needed, so she had accepted the invitation.</p><p>She didn't harbor deep feelings for the Hidden Moon Convent.</p><p>Nor did she hold high expectations for it.</p><p>With a demonic Holy King looming, how could she ask the old nun to gamble the convent's survival?</p><p>Regardless of the abbess's intentions, her willingness to stay was akin to offering timely assistance, so Liuli expressed her sincere gratitude.</p><p>Liuli immersed her mind in the jade slip.</p><p>They had been exploring the Golden Aspect Hall for some time, and combined with the convent's existing records, they had a general grasp of the protective formation's layout and flow, with many areas documented in detail, ready to be exploited.</p><p>At this moment, demonic Qi permeated the Golden Aspect Hall.</p><p>Unable to locate Qin Sang, Bai Xiao found it exceedingly difficult to search through the protective formation.  He simply led the demons to surround a large area of sword peaks, trapping Qin Sang within.</p><p>The demons formed a formation, each occupying a sword peak, watching their surroundings like hawks.</p><p>The four-winged blood serpent and the bone bird continued their attacks, while Bai Xiao ceased, white smoke billowing from his body, drifting upwards to form a head-sized white mass that eventually transformed into the shape of an eyeball.</p><p>The eyeball floated in mid-air, capable of rotating in any direction, a grotesque sight, scrutinizing the area below to prevent Qin Sang from stealthily escaping.</p><p>The next moment, the demons launched a simultaneous attack on the grand formation.</p><p>The peaks trembled, and the formation surged.</p><p>By now, Liuli and the old nun had infiltrated the Golden Aspect Hall. To the old nun's surprise, Liuli moved with a clear purpose, quickly approaching the vicinity of the demon formation. Due to the demonic eye hovering above, she didn't dare get too close.</p><p>Then, Liuli stopped at a certain spot, discreetly unleashing the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>Her Ice Soul Divine Light was inherently subtle, further masked by the disturbances created by the attacks on the grand formation.  No one noticed as the divine light seeped through the formation, its target being Qin Sang's hiding place.</p><p>Back in the North Sea, she had discovered that due to the demonic cultivation's aftereffects, she could sense Qin Sang through the brand within a certain range.  Previously, Qin Sang had likely been within Emperor Bestowal Mountain, concealed by the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, rendering the demonic brand unresponsive.</p><p>Within a certain dark chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body's aura had stabilized and showed signs of improvement.  Just as he was about to deduce his next escape plan, he opened his eyes in astonishment.</p>
