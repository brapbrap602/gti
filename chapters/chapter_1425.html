第一千四百一十七章 天意难违

Suddenly appearing gravestone, and the writing on the gravestone,
Caused Qin Sang's figure to stiffen, completely beyond his expectations.
"Tan Hao?"
Qin Sang came to the Northern Sea, one of his purposes was to find Tan Hao, as well as the mysterious Ghost Mother.
He followed Wind Master, traversed half of the Crescent Moon Realm, without any gains.
He originally intended to wait until the matter of the Pure Ocean Sect was settled, then carefully explore the Boundless Sea.
The Boundless Sea is the most complex and chaotic area in the Northern Sea, making it much easier to do anything without worrying about attracting the hostility of the entire continent.
A mysterious existence like the Ghost Mother is most likely to appear here.
Unexpectedly, he would discover Tan Hao's trail in this situation.
"Tan Hao and the Ghost Mother harvested those spirit medicines. So, the phenomenon that attracted Fellow Daoist Qi was likely caused by their entry. Is the Ghost Mother a Buddhist mighty figure (great expert)?"
Qin Sang observed his surroundings, stepped towards the hill, and stood in front of the gravestone.
The writing on the gravestone carried strong sorrow.
"Since the parting at Yinshan Pass, Tan Hao has strived to save Tan Jie, day after day for a hundred years. Given the bond between the brothers, Tan Hao would never give up if there was even a sliver of hope. He successfully found and rescued the mysterious person behind the Heavenly Corpse Sect, yet he erected this gravestone for Tan Jie here. Even the Ghost Mother could not revive Tan Jie..."
Qin Sang looked at the gravestone, his heart heavy.
From the Canglang Sea to the Little Cold Region, the Abyss of Sin, and then tracing them to the Northern Sea.
Dumb Girl's condition gradually improved, Qin Sang originally thought that finding the Ghost Mother would be the catalyst for Dumb Girl's awakening, but seeing Tan Jie's grave, Qin Sang realized that things might not be so simple.
A faint sigh.
Tan Jie's grave is here, Tan Hao shouldn't have gone far.
"They wouldn't have taken the Pure Ocean Sect as their cave dwelling, would they?"
Qin Sang muttered to himself, put away the Demonic Flame and Golden Sinking Sword, but still harbored some vigilance towards the Ghost Mother, secretly hiding the Demonic Banner in his sleeve, ready to strike at any time.
He shifted his gaze, past the hill, towards the stone wall.
After staring for a while, he discovered an anomaly.
The seemingly ordinary stone wall concealed a restriction within, containing another world (hidden universe).
Just then.
A wave suddenly emerged within the stone wall, emitting 'crackling' sounds.
Qin Sang's heart stirred, stopping his footsteps.
He saw the scene on the stone wall suddenly change, revealing a mountain cave that was obviously artificially opened, the stone door was pushed open from the inside, and a figure walked out.
It was Tan Hao!
"Late Golden Core stage... no! Peak Golden Core stage, only one step away from Nascent Soul stage."
Qin Sang discerned Tan Hao's current realm.
At his age, there was a good chance that he would break through to the Nascent Soul stage.
The true essence within Tan Hao's body showed obvious signs of instability, seemingly caused by forcibly interrupting some kind of secret art he was practicing, fortunately it wasn't serious.
The stone door opened.
Tan Hao pushed open the door and walked out, without summoning any magical treasures.
He skillfully performed a hand seal, divine light flashed in his eyes, just as he was about to look towards the depths of the purple mist to observe the situation, he suddenly saw the unfamiliar figure in front of Tan Jie's grave, and was instantly startled.
Qin Sang deliberately concealed his aura, Tan Hao hadn't noticed at all that there was another person here.
In an instant, Tan Hao's hair stood on end, his face full of shock, and he unhesitatingly summoned his Natal Magic Treasure. But when he saw this person's face, a sense of familiarity welled up in his heart, and Tan Hao froze on the spot.
"You are... Qin..."
Tan Hao's tone was somewhat trembling, his face full of disbelief.
They had been separated for too long.
If it hadn't been for his constant gratitude towards Qin Sang for his kindness to him and his brother, Tan Hao wouldn't have recognized Qin Sang at a glance.
Tan Hao still couldn't believe that Qin Sang would appear here.
After their parting at Yinshan Pass, he traveled abroad, participated in the Three Realms War, and never received any news about Qin Sang again. Even though it was hard to accept, he understood that Qin Sang had most likely already fallen.
A deceased friend, who he thought was separated by life and death, suddenly appeared in front of him, and met in the most impossible place.
It felt like a dream.
"Brother Tan, have you been well?"
Qin Sang's expression was complicated.
The time had indeed been too long, almost three hundred years.
For a moment, the two were speechless.
Qin Sang secretly observed Tan Hao's cave dwelling, discovering that it was very simple, it seemed that only he himself was here, he didn't know where the Ghost Mother was cultivating.
Tan Hao took a deep breath, suppressed his surging thoughts, took a deep look at Qin Sang, and smiled: "Brother Qin, you should be one step ahead of me again, right?"
When he was awakened in the cave dwelling, he had investigated, and hadn't noticed Qin Sang's aura at all. If Qin Sang hadn't taken the initiative to show himself, he would probably still be kept in the dark.
In Tan Hao's eyes, Qin Sang was mysterious and abnormal, unable to discern what realm he was in.
There was only one explanation, Qin Sang's cultivation was far superior to his.
Tan Hao remembered when they met at Yinshan Pass, it was also a similar situation.
Fortunately, Qin Sang gave him the Foundation Establishment Pill, which allowed him to fortunately establish his foundation.
In recent years, he had encountered many lucky chances, which allowed him to reach his current cultivation level, if nothing unexpected happened, he should be able to break through to the Nascent Soul stage before he was four hundred years old, but he didn't expect that he was still inferior to Qin Sang.
He remembered, Qin Junior Brother seemed to have Four Spiritual Roots or Five Spiritual Roots...
"Just luck."
Qin Sang nodded slightly, didn't say much about himself, lowered his head and looked at the gravestone, his tone low, "Brother Tan Jie, he..."
"Heaven's Will is Hard to Defy!"
Tan Hao bitterly shook his head, his tone carrying a strong sense of powerlessness.
Qin Sang could understand the feeling Tan Hao had of pursuing something for hundreds of years, but the final result was like a flower in a mirror, a moon in the water (illusionary).
The cultivation world was such a cruel place.
With Tan Hao's temperament, he didn't need external comfort.
Qin Sang was silent for a moment, and then said: "A hundred years ago, I went to Yinshan Pass, I originally wanted to find you, I saw Yi'en, and learned about your situation from him."
"Yi'en? How is he now?"
Tan Hao's eyes lit up, and he eagerly asked.
"Don't worry, Yi'en is doing well, he has already formed his core (Golden Core), I founded a sect, and he is handling secular affairs for me," Qin Sang briefly explained Tan Yi'en's situation.
Tan Hao breathed a sigh of relief, and murmured: "That's good, that's good..."
He had given up too much for his brother, including his own bloodline, and felt guilty towards Tan Yi'en.
Qin Sang weighed his words and said: "Yi'en has been looking for you, we found several of your friends, and learned that you had investigated the news about the Heavenly Corpse Sect and sneaked into the Abyss of Sin. I then followed the trail to investigate, and finally found the Heavenly Corpse Sect's main altar, as well as the water prison in the Abyss Ruins."
After a pause, Qin Sang looked at Tan Hao.
Tan Hao sighed: "You have put yourselves to much trouble."
Then, he didn't hide anything and talked about his encounter in the Abyss of Sin, which coincided with the clues Qin Sang had found.
Tan Hao heard the mysterious person calling him at the Heavenly Corpse Sect branch, guiding him to the main altar, using saving Tan Jie as a trade, releasing the mysterious person who was trapped in the water prison, and then he was brought to the Northern Sea by the mysterious person.
This person was the Ghost Mother!
"Senior Ghost Mother was trapped in the water prison, suffering from severe injuries and was extremely weak. She barely suppressed her injuries, recovered some of her strength, and passed on a combined attack secret art to me. We worked together to activate a protective magic treasure and pass through the storm belt. Senior Ghost Mother obtained treasures she had left behind in the Northern Sea, which allowed her to heal her injuries and recover all her strength."
Tan Hao explained.
"Treasures left behind before?"
Qin Sang discovered something was wrong, "That Senior accidentally broke into the water prison and was trapped here?"
