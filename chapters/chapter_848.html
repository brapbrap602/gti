<h1>Chapter 840 Demonic Aura</h1><p>As expected of a Greater Demon, its physical body was incredibly robust, especially its bizarre scales, whose luster held a strange power.  Surprisingly, the Star Conch didn't kill it.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't stop there. Pressing his advantage, he retrieved the Star Conch, his figure flickering as he closed in on the demon fish's remains.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Azure Serpent cut off the fish demon's escape route.</p><p>At the last moment, the fish demon's eyes turned crimson, fixing Qin Sang with a resentful glare. Then, employing some unknown secret technique, it detonated its demonic body!</p><p>Flesh and blood exploded into a bloody mist, a crimson shockwave sweeping outwards.</p><p>The wave contained not only immense power but also a corrosive force.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  He stopped abruptly, hastily urging the Ebony Sword to form a protective barrier against the oncoming wave.</p><p>He felt an immense force crash against him, shattering the sword barrier. Qin Sang retreated, forced to evade.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Azure Serpent was too close to escape in time.  It roared, retreating while casting a spell. Azure energy enveloped its body, resisting the blood mist.</p><p>Fortunately, the fish demon was already gravely injured, significantly reducing the power of its self-destruction.  The Twin-Headed Azure Serpent reacted quickly enough. As the blood mist surged forward, the azure energy held it back.</p><p>Its fur became mottled and corroded by the blood mist, appearing battered, but thankfully it wasn't injured.</p><p>However, the blood mist was incredibly strange. Some of it seeped into the azure energy, turning it a mixture of azure and crimson. It even tried to penetrate the serpent's body.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Azure Serpent struggled to purge the blood mist. While it prevented further corrosion, it couldn't completely eliminate it.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was checking on his Twin-Headed Azure Serpent, a streak of crimson suddenly shot out from the blood mist.  With astonishing speed, it darted into the horde of beasts and fled.</p><p>"Demon Core?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. The fish demon wasn't dead; it had only detonated its physical body, its Demon Core escaping.</p><p>It was too late to stop the fish demon's escape.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't pursue.  His priority was to escape quickly. The powerful auras were closing in.</p><p>Without its physical body, the fish demon was no longer a threat. Qin Sang merely glanced at the streak of blood, ignoring it as he moved to the Twin-Headed Azure Serpent's side to examine it.</p><p>The blood mist itself wasn't a major concern, but like a persistent ailment, it was difficult to remove completely.</p><p>Qin Sang worried that the blood mist carried the fish demon's power and could be used to track them.</p><p>Being pursued by a vengeful fish demon leading a horde of beasts would be a serious problem.</p><p>With this in mind, an idea struck Qin Sang. He summoned the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>The blood mist couldn't withstand the demonic flames, burning away and releasing a foul odor.</p><p>"Kill! Kill them! I want to eat their flesh and drink their blood!"</p><p>Having narrowly escaped death, the fish demon shrieked madly within the beast horde, filled with hatred for those who had cost it its physical form.</p><p>Driven by the fish demon's screams, the other beasts went into a frenzy, lunging at Qin Sang.</p><p>The blood mist finally purged, Qin Sang and the Twin-Headed Azure Serpent fought their way through the beast horde, the Ebony Sword clearing a path.</p><p>The Greater Demons hadn't arrived yet, and the lesser demons were no match for Qin Sang and the serpent.</p><p>The powerful auras, sensing the fish demon's near-death experience, were clearly startled and hesitated, missing their best opportunity.</p><p>Having lost its body, the fish demon was in no position to pursue.  It could only watch helplessly as Qin Sang cut a swathe through the horde, growing increasingly distant.  Its cries became even more furious and shrill.</p><p>Qin Sang rushed outwards.  After escaping some distance, he tossed a scroll upwards.</p><p>Flying flowers formed an illusion, confusing the surrounding lesser demons, causing them to lose their target.</p><p>Amidst the beast tide, such illusions were easily broken.</p><p>However, for Qin Sang, it was enough cover.</p><p>He recalled the Twin-Headed Azure Serpent and activated the Celestial Demon Transformation!</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A pair of phoenix wings unfolded behind his back, and Qin Sang's aura shifted dramatically, the demonic energy around him intensifying.</p><p>This was a peculiar change Qin Sang had discovered while cultivating this technique.</p><p>From the beginning of his cultivation of the "Celestial Demon Refining Form," even before he learned the Celestial Demon Transformation, subtle changes had been occurring.</p><p>To disguise himself and appear weaker, he had previously consumed Demonic Augmentation Pills, which had given him a faint demonic aura.</p><p>Therefore, he hadn't initially noticed the changes in himself.</p><p>It wasn't until he broke through to the second level of the "Celestial Demon Refining Form" that he realized his demonic aura seemed stronger than before.</p><p>And when he learned the Celestial Demon Transformation, upon activating this divine ability, he was astonished to discover that his demonic aura was almost comparable to a Demon Spirit level beast.</p><p>This strange transformation had initially worried Qin Sang, fearing that cultivating this technique would turn him into a demon beast.</p><p>Later, after a long period, Qin Sang confirmed that aside from the demonic aura, there were no other changes to his body. He relaxed, suspecting that the phoenix wings on his back might be the cause.</p><p>With his demonic aura and the magnificent phoenix wings resembling those of a Azure Phoenix, Qin Sang felt he could even disguise himself as a transformed Greater Demon.</p><p>Trapped in the beast tide, Qin Sang had wondered if he could activate the Celestial Demon Transformation to confuse the demons and escape.</p><p>He had only cultivated to the second level of "Celestial Demon Refining Form," and the Celestial Demon Transformation still had many flaws.  It naturally couldn't fool the eyes of Greater Demons.</p><p>But it should be somewhat effective in confusing the less intelligent lesser demons.</p><p>Entangled with the fish demon for so long, the path opened by the golden light had closed. Qin Sang had to find his own way out.</p><p>As expected, the illusion was quickly dispersed by the beast tide.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang and the Twin-Headed Azure Serpent disappeared from sight.</p><p>He enveloped himself with his phoenix wings, merging into the beast tide.  Reappearing discreetly, he was delighted to see that the surrounding demons were much less hostile towards him.</p><p>The demonic aura generated by the Celestial Demon Transformation could actually deceive the demons' senses!</p><p>The beasts viewed him as one of their own, reducing the resistance he faced.  Qin Sang's movements became less conspicuous amidst the chaotic beast tide.</p><p>When the fish demon and its subordinates caught up, they were enraged to find that they had lost track of Qin Sang.</p><p>Even the demons with the keenest sense of smell, sniffing everywhere, couldn't find him, as if he had vanished into thin air.</p><p>The fish demon was furious, but for the moment, it couldn't think of a solution.  It had to abandon its plan to monopolize the treasure and urgently contact the Leopard Demon.</p><p>Having shaken off his pursuers, Qin Sang felt a wave of relief.  He nimbly weaved through the beast horde, finally reaching the outer edge and seeing the distant night sky and stars.</p><p>He didn't know that due to the Celestial Demon Transformation, his altered aura had inadvertently saved him from a great calamity.</p><p>...</p><p>While Qin Sang was escaping, the Merchant Alliance found themselves in a desperate battle.</p><p>They were surrounded by a large group of Greater Demons, including several formidable ones like the Crane Demon, who possessed intelligence.</p><p>These Greater Demons were not only powerful but also coordinated and difficult to deal with. No matter how many experts they had, they couldn't withstand such a ferocious assault and quickly fell into a bitter struggle.</p><p>Lady Liu and Jin Ying deeply regretted not leaving with Qin Sang.</p><p>They were still unaware that it was Qin Sang who had inadvertently drawn the demons' attention.</p>
