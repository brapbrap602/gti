<h1>Chapter 2168: Gathering Storm</h1><p>Qin Sang failed to obtain useful information from Ji Xia. Tracing the poison's source would likely take considerable time.  Besides the Thunder Hall, there were no visible opportunities. Qin Sang sensed something was amiss, and unwilling to waste more time, he returned to his original location.</p><p>Above the dark clouds, he looked out into the pitch-black, silent expanse. If not for the constant sensation from the mark on his palm, he wouldn't have guessed a Thunder Hall was hidden here.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang made no preparations. The location was already well-concealed; adding any formations or restrictions would be superfluous. Even if someone discovered the secret, without the golden book imprint, entry would not be easy.</p><p>With a flash, Qin Sang passed through the clouds and descended to the ground. Thunder boomed around him, the sudden noise shattering the silence.  Glancing at the palace gate, Qin Sang touched the mark on his palm. In a blink, the thunder vanished, and he found himself back in his hut.</p><p>The transition was peculiar. It didn't feel like a teleportation array. Where exactly was the Thunder Hall located?  The fact that the radiant light could connect to that space made it even more intriguing.</p><p>However, now wasn't the time for such inquiries. After meeting Ji Xia, Qin Sang felt a storm brewing.  If something happened at the 異人族 (Yi Ren Zu) sacred land, he couldn't remain unaffected.  He needed to achieve his goal quickly to remain composed and weather the storm.</p><p>Contemplating, Qin Sang looked at his palm. The mark remained, and when he exited the hut, the fluctuations of the spirit formation dissipated, but the mark hadn't reverted to the golden book.  It was clearly bound to him; others couldn't take it.</p><p>This trip felt anticlimactic.  He hadn't expected much from the Thunder Hall and felt no regret. His greatest disappointment was failing to ascertain the nature of the orb and its connection to the golden book and the Thunder Hall. He had high hopes for the orb.</p><p>Flying beyond the mountain, Qin Sang found everything normal and flew towards the island's edge. He quickly passed through the island's protective array, left the island, and returned to Red Lake.</p><p>Back in the cave, Min Zhuo projected a beam of spiritual light toward Qin Sang, conveying events during his absence.  Everything at Red Lake remained peaceful; the enemy hadn't arrived.</p><p>Perhaps the Grand Marshal had escaped by chance, or perhaps he remained steadfast and hadn't revealed any secrets. If the enemy knew he and Si Lu would meet here, they would have certainly laid an ambush.</p><p>Continuing to wait was pointless. Qin Sang put away his array tools, stored Min Zhuo in his small heavenly space, erased all traces of his presence, and departed.</p><p>From Red Lake to the meeting place with Liuli, there was still a journey of nearly ten days. To avoid unnecessary trouble, Qin Sang didn't use thunder escape, but he hardly paused, traveling day and night.</p><p>He passed two famous secret realms along the way, sensing several presences – some traveling in groups, others alone. Regardless of their strength, Qin Sang always concealed his presence and avoided them.</p><p>His journey proceeded smoothly.  In less than five days, he covered half the distance.</p><p>Evening of the fifth day.</p><p>Qin Sang was flying over a mountainous area. There were no steep peaks, only rolling hills covered with tall ancient trees, a scene of vibrant life.  The area was uninhabited, devoid of any beasts, a rare peaceful place.</p><p>Still pondering the radiant light, Qin Sang experienced a familiar fluctuation.  He paused, surprised, and looked ahead.</p><p>In the sky above this wilderness, clusters of colorful clouds suddenly appeared.</p><p>Including Ji Xia, this was the fourth time Qin Sang had encountered this radiant light—its frequency was alarmingly high!</p><p>The radiant light was dazzling, seemingly born from a white cloud, rapidly dyeing the surrounding clouds with vibrant hues.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang witnessed the entire eruption.  It began as a single point, quickly expanding outwards.  Its light illuminated the land, turning the earth and sky into a breathtaking spectacle of color.</p><p>But beneath this beauty lay a destructive power. The clouds were but a fleeting phenomenon, instantly dispersed by the radiant light's force. Then the earth suffered.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly saw a beam of radiant light descend from the heavens, striking a hill.</p><p>In an instant, the earth shook and the hills were obliterated, leaving behind a bottomless pit.  The radiant energy continued to spread, overwhelming even the protective formations of the hidden realm and its ancient ruins.  Countless plants, trees, and hills were destroyed in its wake.</p><p>In a short time, the land was ravaged and unrecognizable. If the energy continued to erupt, the entire mountain range would likely be destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang, aware of the energy’s power, immediately changed direction to put distance between himself and the devastation.  At the same time, he kept his eyes fixed on the source of the energy.</p><p>The three previous outbreaks had all occurred near dangerous nests and hidden ruins, suggesting a possible connection. But after a long observation, Qin Sang found no trace of any ruins or any force capable of resisting the energy.  Waves of light, substantial and powerful, relentlessly swept across the land.</p><p>“Was it all coincidence?”</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind, but he then detected a strange fluctuation.  He shifted his gaze to the edge of the radiant energy.</p><p>As the energy expanded, it engulfed the mountains and valleys, reaching other areas. Where it passed, mountains vanished and the earth collapsed in earth-shattering booms.</p><p>As the energy washed over several more peaks, the mountains were first toppled by the force of the impact, crashing to the ground. Then, their bodies were torn apart and annihilated by the light.  Huge craters formed where they once stood, but then an unusual sight appeared.</p><p>Two sharp cries echoed from within a crater, followed by two white streaks shooting into the air.  These were long ribbons, their movements creating unseen waves that finally met resistance to the radiant energy.</p><p>'Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The ribbons danced in the air, and two winged women emerged from the crater.</p><p>Immediately afterward, two grey figures pursued them – the grey figures, now mimicking the appearance of the two women.</p><p>“More winged warriors?”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, observing the two women.</p><p>Their wings were not pure white, but more of a silvery white, indicating that they were not members of the Sacred Wing clan of the Avian race, whose wings held the highest status and could not bear a single flaw.</p><p>Whether the two women were from the Common Wing clan or another Avian clan remained unclear, as some tribes shared similar appearances and abilities.</p><p>Below them, in the crater, a striking red glow revealed the eruption of magma.</p><p>This was no ordinary magma.  Qin Sang sensed the fluctuations of an ancient protective formation within; an ancient array that had been disrupted by the radiant energy.</p><p>The two women were likely in the process of breaking the formation when they were struck by this calamity, and they weren't alone.</p><p>Their cultivation level was similar to Qin Sang's, but he detected a stronger presence within the magma!</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The two women used their ribbons to attack the grey figures.  The grey figures wielded identical ribbons and used the same techniques. The women seemed to realize something was amiss, focusing on dodging and avoiding the use of other abilities.</p><p>While maneuvering, they kept an eye on the changes deep within the magma, their expressions suddenly shifting as they finally noticed Qin Sang outside the radiant energy's range.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't hidden himself; he stood there openly.</p><p>Seeing no grey figures near Qin Sang, the women guessed the situation and, after a moment's hesitation, flew toward him.</p><p>The grey figures relentlessly pursued them. Once they were outside the energy’s reach, the grey figures were defeated and dissipated, unable to reform.</p><p>The two women breathed a sigh of relief, eyeing Qin Sang with wary expressions.</p><p>“Greetings, fellow cultivators,”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, pointing at the magma, “May I ask if there is a hidden realm there?”</p><p>The women's brows furrowed, their vigilance intensifying.  Their ribbons twitched, pointed at Qin Sang, ready to attack at any sign of aggression.</p><p>The older-looking woman exclaimed, “This is not a place you can interfere with. Leave immediately, and we will not trouble you!”</p><p>It wasn't out of kindness. Qin Sang's confidence was unsettling.  The energy's magnitude was also significant, likely attracting more people. A peaceful resolution was preferable.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, amused. He knew his question was abrupt and explained, “I merely happened to pass by; I am not after this realm. I only wish to ask you a few questions.”</p><p>"I wonder how large the protective array of that relic mansion covers.  Was the radiant glow emanating from inside?"</p><p>He saw the glow coming from the sky, but that might not be the truth. Perhaps a giant, hidden formation was obscuring his perception.</p><p>The two women exchanged glances. The elder woman said coldly, "We don't know what you're talking about. The space inside was only a few rooms large. We were fine inside, then suddenly something happened, and we came out to see this glow."</p><p>"I understand," Qin Sang nodded, his heart sinking slightly.</p><p>If the previous three incidents weren't coincidences, and the glow is now affecting the ordinary mountains and fields, does that mean it's rapidly evolving and becoming more aggressive?</p><p>As far as Qin Sang knew, the trials in the Sacred Grounds were always gradual, with experts from all factions preparing thoroughly before the final showdown.</p><p>This time is quite unusual!</p><p>"Thank you for clarifying, my friends. I won't disturb you further. Farewell!"</p><p>Qin Sang vanished in a flash, leaving the scene.</p><p>The two women's expressions relaxed slightly, but they remained vigilant, carefully watching their surroundings.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang flew some distance away but didn't leave immediately. He landed on a mountaintop to observe.</p><p>If the glow attracted other experts, leading to a battle, and there was something beneficial to him in the relic mansion, he wouldn't mind getting a share. This wait wouldn't be long. Gradually, the glow reached its peak, then began to rapidly fade.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang notice two figures arriving late. The newcomers' cultivation and concealment skills were not very sophisticated, and those from the mansion had already controlled the situation.</p><p>As with their previous encounter, the glow brought danger, but it also helped them break the ancient array.</p><p>"No chance."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, without any hesitation, and immediately left.</p><p>...</p><p>He didn't encounter the glow again, but on the eighth day, Qin Sang had another astonishing encounter.</p><p>He was flying over a vast lake, boundless in expanse, with countless islands scattered across it.</p><p>As he flew, a strange aura came from the distance. Qin Sang stopped, sensing carefully for a moment. His eyes widened in shock.  He hesitated for a moment, then carefully concealed himself.</p><p>The source of the aura was an island.</p><p>The island wasn't large. In the center was a solitary peak that soared into the clouds.</p><p>The peak's summit had been leveled by immense power. A man in a green robe sat there. Around the peak, ethereal flags floated in mid-air, and another person stood amongst them, holding a magic sword.</p><p>The flags formed a large array; the sword was used to control it. The array sealed the island while masking their presence.</p><p>However, the intense fluctuations on the island could no longer be concealed by the array.</p><p>The sword-wielder looked up at the peak, where dark clouds gathered, and a hurricane howled. The sky above was dramatically shifting, like an ink painting, or an apocalyptic scene.</p><p>Within the turbulent sky was a golden circle, and a huge, majestic ox phantom stood proudly in the void, roaring at the heavens, its horns seeming to pierce the sky.</p><p>An extremely powerful aura stirred heaven and earth. Sensing it, the sword-wielder showed deep reverence and envy.</p><p>"Someone is attempting the Ascension Stage!"</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang breathed a sigh, his eyes filled with envy as well.</p><p>The Sacred Grounds are a treasure trove for the practitioners of the 異人族 (Yi Ren Zu -  Assume this translates culturally appropriately as 'the Unusual People'), and countless people have obtained chances to advance to the Sacred Realm here throughout history.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't expect someone to break through so soon. He dared not approach, only watching from afar.</p><p>On the top of the solitary peak...</p><p>The celestial phenomenon intensified. The ox became increasingly agitated, roaring like thunder, yet seemingly bound by some restraint.</p><p>That restraint grew weaker, but finally, the ox didn't break through, perhaps exhausted.  The ox let out a final roar, transforming into a stream of light that entered the green-robed man's body. The golden light changed into a golden bracelet, encircling the man's wrist.</p><p>The celestial phenomena began to dissipate.</p><p>"Elder Brother!"</p><p>Seeing this, the sword-wielder flew to the summit, his face full of worry.</p><p>The green-robed man, however, looked calm, smiling faintly, "Don't worry! For me, reaching the Ancestor Realm is only a matter of time. Breaking through too early, even if I'm not taken away, would subject me to many restrictions. I prefer to stay and see what our ancestors intend to do this time!"</p><p>His confidence eased the sword-wielder's anxiety.</p><p>Having spoken, the green-robed man stood tall, gazing at the heavens, his eyes deep, his robes billowing.</p><p>After a moment, he swept his gaze around, and snorted coldly.</p><p>Qin Sang and those attracted by the green-robed man's breakthrough retreated quietly.</p><p>The two on the island then put away their flags and left.</p>
