<h1>Chapter 546: Peculiar Insects and Spirit Insects</h1><p>Both unorthodox paths could be used to directly enhance combat prowess.  Qin Sang had gained considerable experience with this during the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>His smooth journey to his current level, possessing strength surpassing his peers during Foundation Establishment, wasn't solely due to his cultivation method, but also relied heavily on external forces.</p><p>Besides magical treasures, the most helpful factor was his choice to cultivate the Corpse Path.  Quickly increasing combat strength is one of the hallmarks of the Heavenly Corpse Sect's corpse refinement techniques.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang only possessed the first half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*.  He had tried to find the second half, making inquiries about the Heavenly Corpse Sect whenever possible, but to no avail.</p><p>The Flying Night Fiend was strong, but its strength was limited. Like living corpses, their power plateaued at the moment of refinement. During early Golden Core, the Flying Night Fiend was indeed a valuable asset, but with further cultivation advancements, it would become a burden.</p><p>Qin Sang himself, even as a corpse refiner, couldn't find a way to increase his own power, let alone enhance the Flying Night Fiend.  He wondered if the Heavenly Corpse Sect had other secret methods, similar to refining Corpse Cores, that could further enhance the Flying Night Fiend's strength.</p><p>Corpse refinement techniques of other sects were clearly different from the Heavenly Corpse Sect's.  The only possible reference was to borrow their body tempering methods and see if the Flying Night Fiend could break the limitations of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang had to plan ahead and avoid limiting himself to a single path.</p><p>After thoroughly studying the *Fragmentary Records of the Supreme Profound Formation* and the Golden Core insights, Qin Sang sighed.  He couldn't find any other quick and easy methods that didn't require significant effort, like the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*.</p><p>Both the path of Spirit Formations and Beast Taming required considerable dedication.</p><p>Without sufficient knowledge of Spirit Formations, it was impossible to understand the *Fragmentary Records of the Supreme Profound Formation*.  Unless Qin Sang sought guidance from a Spirit Formation master and started learning from scratch.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't give up completely. He often contemplated the scroll, drawing parallels to gain some insights into Restriction formations.</p><p>The Beast Taming path was also challenging. Although the insights of the Beast Taming Sect Golden Core cultivator weren't obscure, one couldn't make bricks without straw.</p><p>Beast Taming was equally vast and profound.  Spirit beasts were categorized into birds, beasts, fish, and insects.</p><p>Some beast tamers, like the Snake Mistress, focused on nurturing a single spirit beast, feeding it with their own essence blood, connecting their lives with the beast's. The beast's strength was comparable to its master's, creating a two-on-one advantage in combat.</p><p>Others took the opposite approach, overwhelming opponents with sheer numbers.</p><p>Some specialized in breeding venomous beasts, collecting all kinds of bizarre poisonous creatures, essentially following a similar path as poison-using demonic cultivators.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivator's insights also mentioned the Beast Taming Sect's Beast Formations.  The most powerful Beast Formations were comparable to renowned Spirit Formations, but the requirements were extremely demanding.</p><p>That Golden Core cultivator was eccentric.  He wasn't interested in the aforementioned methods, favoring Insect Control within Beast Taming. His insights primarily focused on this aspect.</p><p>To utilize his insights, one had to follow the same path, which explained why Old Man Di Que collected so many peculiar insects and spirit insects back then.</p><p>The difficulty was apparent: it required significant effort to find and nurture these peculiar insects.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang felt regretful.  Back in the ancient cultivator's ruins, he had snatched Old Man Di Que's mustard seed bag but failed to obtain the spirit beast bag.  Otherwise, things would be much easier now.</p><p>Spirit insects were relatively easy to find, though rare. With the power of a Golden Core cultivator, it wasn't difficult to locate them. However, their potential was far inferior to peculiar insects.  Similar to Greenèš¨ Insects, even after painstakingly nurturing them to adulthood, they only served as support.</p><p>Actually, there was no clear distinction between peculiar insects and spirit insects in the cultivation world.  They were collectively referred to as spirit insects.  Peculiar insects were a classification specific to the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p>They compiled a list of insects they deemed peculiar, based on two criteria:  possessing powerful and unusual abilities, and their potential.</p><p>Peculiar insects had higher potential.  Some needed multiple transformations to reach adulthood, and their adult forms could rival, or even surpass, Nascent Soul cultivators!</p><p>However, not only were they extremely difficult to find, but each type was a rare encounter, and nurturing them was incredibly challenging.</p><p>The transformation conditions were incredibly stringent, comparable to human cultivators breaking through realms.</p><p>According to the Beast Taming Sect's records, for peculiar and spirit insects, the first transformation after hatching, before adulthood, was analogous to a human cultivator's Foundation Establishment, the second to Golden Core, and so on.</p><p>Spirit insects could generally undergo only one or at most two transformations before reaching adulthood, while peculiar insects had the potential for at least three.</p><p>The difficulty of each transformation increased exponentially.  Especially after adulthood, their potential was exhausted, and further transformation was unlikely without extraordinary encounters.</p><p>But having potential didn't guarantee transformation.  Old Man Di Que had possessed the Fire Jade Centipedes for an unknown duration, and they had long reached the limit for transformation, yet they couldn't initiate their first transformation. They could only be used for treasure hunting.</p><p>Because the Beast Taming Sect didn't know how to help the Fire Jade Centipedes transform.  Their understanding of peculiar insects was limited, as very few cultivators had actually encountered them in the current cultivation world.</p><p>Through ancient texts or the experiences of their predecessors, they had only recorded a handful of peculiar insects and the supplementary spirit herbs required for their transformations, mostly limited to the first two.</p><p>Like Qin Sang's Blood Winged Ghost Head Bees, he didn't know how to help them and could only let them fend for themselves.</p><p>If not for the two Fire Jade Centipedes luckily encountering the Crimson Gold Vine Fruit, which could aid spirit insect breakthroughs, they might still be unable to transform.</p><p>The Blood Winged Ghost Head Bees were even more unfortunate. Their growth stagnated before their first transformation, and even the Crimsonfire Gold Liquid was ineffective.</p><p>Qin Sang only had one Crimson Gold Vine Fruit and a limited amount of Crimsonfire Gold Liquid, so naturally, he wouldn't waste them.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang couldn't make up his mind and could only take things one step at a time. If he encountered a cultivable peculiar insect, he could pursue the Beast Taming path then.</p><p>Moreover, he wasn't necessarily limited to choosing between these paths.  Shao Hua Mountain was one of the eight righteous sects, with numerous Nascent Soul and Golden Core elders.</p><p>After reaching Golden Core, he could consult them or access cultivation texts available only to Golden Core cultivators, perhaps finding more suitable secret methods.</p><p>Having figured this out, Qin Sang stopped worrying and turned his attention to refining tools.</p><p>He had spent over two decades studying tool refining. Though not a master, his skills were respectable, and he shouldn't neglect this craft after reaching Golden Core.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to refine his own magical treasures in the future.</p><p>He secretly hoped that after reaching Golden Core, he could befriend some cultivators from the Illusory Spirit Sect and seek their guidance. After all, his tool refining skills came from Shopkeeper Wu, obtained legitimately.</p><p>His sect also possessed treasured tool refining texts, though not as profound as the Illusory Spirit Sect's, which he could also study.</p>
