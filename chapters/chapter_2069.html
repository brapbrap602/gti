<h1>Chapter 2060: The Source Sea</h1><p>“Could it be that the two of you intend to confront experts from the Changyou Clan?  Unfortunately, I'm unfamiliar with their divine abilities and can't offer any useful advice," Si Lu shook his head.</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at him and said, "What if we wanted you to take us to the Changyou Clan's ancestral land?"</p><p>Si Lu was taken aback, shocked.  "You want to go to the Mist Sea?"</p><p>"Do you think it's feasible?"</p><p>Qin Sang lifted his jade cup, took a sip, and quietly watched Si Lu.</p><p>Si Lu's first reaction was that it was absurd. The Celestial Realm was not like the Aquatic Realm. Human cultivators rarely reached there. Before being driven out, he had never seen a human cultivator in his clan.</p><p>The Celestial Realm clans harbored no goodwill towards unfamiliar foreign races. Moreover, the Mist Sea was not only filled with Mist Beasts and Mist Cascades but also teemed with various unknown dangers, making it impassable for those unfamiliar with it.</p><p>However…</p><p>Si Lu suddenly realized that this might be an opportunity for him.</p><p>He was certainly not resigned to wandering forever. Once he accumulated sufficient strength, he would definitely return and avenge his humiliation. But for now, he himself was still being controlled by others, and he didn't know when he could gain his freedom, let alone when he could take his revenge.</p><p>Entering the Mist Sea, the other party would inevitably rely on him more, at least he wouldn't have to fear them suddenly turning against him.</p><p>Perhaps, they could even become his allies. Especially Qin Sang, who had fought against several experts and retreated unscathed. His strength might not be weaker than Xia Changshi's. It was important to note that this person was only at the early stage of cultivation now, and his future was limitless.</p><p>Furthermore, Si Lu knew deeply that revenge could not be achieved by strength alone. Unless he could break through to the Saint Realm, he would have to gain the support of other clan members. But if he waited for hundreds or thousands of years to return, who would still remember him?</p><p>Due to the circumstances, he couldn't return to his ancestral land; he was willing but powerless. Now, the opportunity to return to the Mist Sea had presented itself, which was exactly what he wished for.</p><p>Si Lu lifted his eyes and cautiously asked, "May I ask, what is your purpose in seeking the Changyou Clan?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled but remained silent.</p><p>Si Lu understood in his heart. It seemed that it was nothing good for the Changyou Clan. However, as long as it wasn't against the Zhuyan Clan, he didn't need to worry too much.</p><p>"If you only intend to stay in the Mist Sea briefly and return quickly, the involvement won't be too deep, and I have a way to help you conceal your identities. The most pressing concern is the journey to the Celestial Realm. The path is long and prone to accidents," Si Lu said thoughtfully.</p><p>"What if we want to stay in the Mist Sea for a long time?" Qin Sang asked again.</p><p>"A long time…"</p><p>Si Lu's eyes flickered, surprised. Seeing Qin Sang's expression didn't seem to be feigning, he hesitated for a moment, then solemnly said, "Could you allow me some time to consider?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Please do."</p><p>The other party was, after all, a Void Refinement expert.  Qin Sang didn't want to resort to other means unless absolutely necessary. It was best to reach an agreement without coercion.</p><p>Si Lu thanked him, got up, and excused himself.</p><p>Returning to the side hall, Si Lu sat down on the meditation mat, his expression grave, lost in thought.</p><p>In fact, he had a secret he hadn't revealed. He and Xia Changshi hadn't crossed the vast ocean by swimming themselves, but had passed through an ancient translocation formation.</p><p>He didn't know whether his father had told Xia Changshi about this formation or if Xia Changshi had discovered it by accident. When the crisis came, Xia Changshi saved him and activated this translocation formation, thus shaking off their pursuers.</p><p>Unfortunately, fate was cruel. Just as they escaped from danger, their injuries unhealed, they ran into members of the Quanfeng Clan, which led to Xia Changshi's eventual death.</p><p>It was certain that the translocation formation had been sealed for a long time, likely a relic from ancient times. Xia Changshi had said that no one else in the clan knew about it. They had intended to make a comeback, and before leaving, they had made all the necessary arrangements. They shouldn't have been discovered by the clan.</p><p>After their conversation, Si Lu understood Qin Sang's true intention, which was to have him lead the way to the Celestial Realm. However, he didn't know how far it was from Blue Sand Province to the Celestial Realm, nor how many dangers lay along the way.</p><p>Unless, he revealed this ancient translocation formation!</p><p>He had to be cautious. Once the news about the formation leaked out, he would lose an escape route.</p><p>However, how to deal with Qin Sang was a pressing issue. The other party wouldn't allow him to consider for too long.</p><p>Various thoughts flashed through Si Lu's mind. What he could be sure of now was that the other party had no connection to his clan and could be won over by him.</p><p>The other party dared to abduct him under the noses of so many experts, showing they were not afraid of trouble.</p><p>However, to win them over, he had to demonstrate sufficient value.</p><p>After much deliberation, Si Lu finally made a decision and returned to the main hall, waking up Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing Si Lu's solemn expression, Qin Sang asked, "Have you made up your mind?"</p><p>Si Lu nodded, his voice deep. "I have a secret that can save us a lot of trouble on our journey to the Mist Sea. But before I tell you, I need to ask a question."</p><p>"Please speak," Qin Sang said seriously.</p><p>"How long is the 'long time' you mentioned earlier?" Si Lu stared into Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Time was important to him. Only if it was long enough would it be worth his full effort to win them over.</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely guessed Si Lu's intention. After thinking for a moment, he answered truthfully, "If this trip is unsuccessful, we will return immediately. If we successfully find what we are looking for, we will likely stay there and establish a cultivation sanctuary."</p><p>"Establish a cultivation sanctuary!"</p><p>Si Lu was greatly surprised, but more so, overjoyed.</p><p>Establishing a cultivation sanctuary in a foreign race's territory was unconventional, but Si Lu didn't ask why, because the more deeply involved the other party was with the Foreign Tribes, the more they would rely on him.</p><p>"In that case, I have no need to hide anything..."</p><p>Si Lu's tone was low as he recounted the matter of the translocation formation.</p><p>He didn't rush to express his intention to win them over, understanding that this wasn't something that could be accomplished overnight.  The first priority was to gain their trust, and at the same time, he needed to observe them.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  He hadn't expected rescuing Si Lu to have such a pleasant surprise.  He had originally thought Si Lu could guide them on a safe route, but unexpectedly, there was an ancient translocation formation. This way, they could quickly reach the Celestial Realm. Although the opposite side was near the Siyou Clan's territory, it would be much easier to find the Changyou Clan once they arrived there.</p><p>Some time later, Su Nu returned. Qin Sang told her the good news, and Su Nu was also overjoyed. She immediately summoned Si Lu and used her spiritual energy to manifest a sea chart.</p><p>On one side of the sea chart was Blue Sand Province, and on the other side was the endless ocean, also known as the Outer Sea by the Blue Sand Province cultivators. There were some markings on it, the most prominent being a series of red lines, which were the routes of the treasure ships.</p><p>However, the routes only had simple markings, indicating the general direction of travel. Without a ship captain to lead the way, forcing one's way through would only lead to death. Qin Sang and the others were certainly not among those who would do so. There were actually not many places in the world that could threaten the lives of Void Refinement cultivators, but taking a treasure ship could save a lot of trouble.</p><p>Si Lu walked to the sea chart. He and Xia Changshi had encountered pursuit before they could gain a foothold, and they had fled all the way to Blue Sand Province, never having returned. After asking Su Nu a few questions, he dared to be certain.</p><p>"It should be in this area. As long as we are within a thousand miles, I can definitely recognize it."</p><p>Si Lu pointed to a certain spot on the sea chart, his tone confident.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at where he was pointing and found that it was located in the northeast direction, not too far or too close to Blue Sand Province, separated by a sea region called the Source Sea.</p><p>From the chart, the Source Sea was directly east of Blue Sand Province and covered a vast area. Strangely, these routes all chose to bypass the Source Sea, as if it were a man-eating beast.  Not a single treasure ship dared to cross the Source Sea, preferring to spend more time taking detours.</p><p>Su Nu looked at Qin Sang and said, "The Mist Sea is in that direction. They happened to land on the route used by the Foreign Tribes, no wonder they encountered them."</p><p>"Is it possible that those people discovered the translocation formation?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Si Lu shook his head. "Absolutely impossible!"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over the routes.  Going from the north side of the Source Sea was closer, but they might also encounter Foreign Tribes.</p><p>Now they had to avoid any unnecessary complications. Qin Sang pointed out a few routes.  "Have all of these been investigated?"</p><p>Su Nu calculated silently. "There is one treasure ship that sets sail in a year."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "A year, the time is a bit tight, but we don't need to prepare anything else. If the two of you have no objections, let's choose this one!"</p><p>Su Nu had no objections.</p><p>Si Lu said, "With the medicinal pills given by the two of you, in a year, I should be able to stabilize the injuries in my body and won't hold you back."</p><p>Next, everyone began to make preparations in full swing.</p><p>Qin Sang asked Si Lu to guide the two brothers in their free time, and had them depart first with Su Nu.</p><p>He himself went to several important Immortal Cities in Blue Sand Province, and finally purchased a batch of treasures, including some cultivation techniques and secret arts.</p><p>Although Void Refinement inheritances were rare, Flowing Years Small Pavilion also had some treasured collections. However, in Qin Sang's eyes, they were somewhat biased and shallow, with various flaws and hardly top-tier.</p><p>Of course, they were more than enough for the cultivators of the Storm Realm.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A majestic treasure ship sliced through the sea, leaving a long white line in its wake.</p><p>The surface of the treasure ship had a faint glow, looking somewhat old, but its interior held another world.  Formation restrictions divided it into courtyards, each undisturbed by the others.</p><p>In addition, there were merchants selling various treasures, who would also purchase beast bones and spiritual materials on the spot. There were also various places for enjoyment, everything one could think of. A single ship was like a small Immortal City, and these merchants resided on the ship year-round.</p><p>Those cultivators who spent years training overseas obtained supplies through these treasure ships.</p><p>Inside a courtyard with a small lake and artificial mountains, Qin Sang and the others sat around a stone table.  Outside, the vast expanse of blue waves stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><p>The treasure ship plowed through the waves at great speed. They had already left Blue Sand Province for some time, and what they encountered ahead were mostly deserted islands.</p><p>At this time, clear bell chimes drifted into the courtyard.</p><p>Everyone looked up and saw a giant sail slowly unfurl, almost covering the sky. The ship's hull vibrated slightly, slowly rising from the sea. Then, a sudden gust of wind arose, and the ship's speed increased dramatically.</p><p>The giant sail bulged, shimmering with a dark light. A faint dark light sprinkled down, as if a layer of gray gauze had been cast over everyone's vision.</p><p>At this moment, all traces of the treasure ship vanished from the outside. Only cultivators and demonic beasts with sufficiently high cultivation could detect the fluctuations of its Qi.</p><p>The treasure ship was using formations to conceal itself, avoiding unnecessary trouble.</p><p>At the same time, the ship's bow turned slightly south, gradually deviating from its original course.</p><p>Qin Sang looked outside the courtyard and saw a group of people gathered at the bow. He then got up and left the courtyard, walking to the bow.</p><p>Among this group of people, one person was very conspicuous. This person had a pipe in his mouth, a centipede-shaped scar on his forehead, a burly build, and a bare chest, looking quite like a bandit.</p><p>This person was the captain of the treasure ship, surnamed Wu.  Despite his fierce appearance, he had a good reputation outside.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, Captain Wu looked over and grinned, patting his chest.  "I apologize for the disturbance just now, Fellow Daoist Qin. The road ahead is not peaceful, and this will help us avoid trouble. Fellow Daoist can simply go back and cultivate in peace. On Wu's ship, you don't have to worry about anything!"</p><p>The others seemed to be quite familiar with the captain and praised him one after another.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and walked to the ship's railing, gazing eastward.  "I have a question. Why do you all avoid the Source Sea? What is the origin of this Source Sea?"</p><p>"Oh? Has Fellow Daoist never been out to sea before?"</p><p>Captain Wu looked Qin Sang over once more, a mysterious smile appearing on his face. "If Fellow Daoist has nothing else to do, you'll know in a moment."</p><p>Qin Sang was also curious, so he stayed at the bow as suggested.</p><p>The treasure ship continued sailing for some time. Captain Wu's expression suddenly shifted, and he said, "They're here!"</p><p>He then turned to Qin Sang. "These beasts have come early this time!"</p><p>With that, Captain Wu stared intently at a spot on the sea and took out a fist-sized jade bead, gently rubbing it.</p><p>Suddenly, bursts of whooshing sounds came from below, and several beams of dark light shot out from the bottom of the ship. Within the dark light were iron anchors.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Captain Wu no longer concealed anything, and the iron anchors slammed heavily into the sea, stirring up huge waves.</p><p>These were clearly not ordinary iron anchors, but weapons used by the treasure ship to repel enemies when encountering danger. They were integrated with the ship's formation power and possessed considerable might.</p><p>As the waves churned, a splash of blood suddenly appeared. Then, the iron anchors bound a strange fish tightly and dragged it out of the sea, flinging it onto the bow with a powerful swing.</p><p>‘Slap!’</p><p>The strange fish was met with a punch to the head as soon as it landed, instantly losing consciousness.</p><p>Captain Wu rubbed his fist, jumped onto the strange fish, slit open its belly, and, ignoring the blood and gore, reached inside and fumbled around, pulling out a bloody sac. Then, he grinned and took out several jade bottles.</p><p>"This thing must be extracted alive. It's useless once it's dead."</p><p>As he spoke, he squeezed transparent droplets from the sac and carefully placed them into the jade bottles.</p><p>Suddenly remembering Qin Sang, he looked up. "Did Fellow Daoist see anything?"</p><p>"Poison?"</p><p>Qin Sang had cultivated poison techniques before and had very keen senses. The liquid droplets in the sac were extremely toxic.</p><p>"Precisely!"</p><p>Captain Wu nodded, recounting a legend.</p><p>"The Source Sea also has another name, the Poison Sea. Legend has it that there was once an incredibly powerful force here that cultivated bizarre poison techniques. Their strength was formidable, striking fear into the hearts of all.  There's also a legend that the Source Sea was actually the cultivation sanctuary established by a Great Ascension stage expert, a mighty being known as the Poison God!  It's said that during the Source Sea's heyday, Blue Sand Province was merely a vassal on its periphery.  Situated between the Source Sea and Kanzhou Province, it gradually flourished.  Later, the Source Sea declined for unknown reasons, and now it's completely silent, its inheritance likely broken.  But even in its dormancy, it remains extremely dangerous, like a peerless ferocious beast lurking in the sea with its jaws wide open.  Its outer edges alone are teeming with countless poisonous beasts. The truth of these legends is uncertain, but the danger is real.  No one has ever been seen coming out of it alive, and those who enter never return…"</p><p>Hearing this legend, Qin Sang's heart trembled. "Poison God?"</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
