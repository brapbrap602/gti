<h1>Chapter 1941: The Peerless Fiend</h1><p>Yu Chenghuang and the two Judges were about to question, but upon hearing that the three Star Lords had arrived with their troops in pursuit, their imposing aura suddenly vanished into thin air. They naturally stepped across the threshold and entered the teahouse.</p><p>Including the ghostly officials and soldiers under the nine Spirit Banners, and the chief officials of various departments, also followed in a line, crowding into the teahouse.</p><p>The teahouse had limited space, and most of the ghosts and deities could only stand.</p><p>The audience was engrossed in the story, unaware that the empty seats were filled with deities and ghosts, and some ghostly officials were even standing beside them.</p><p>Winter days are short, and the sky gradually darkened.</p><p>As soon as the hour of the Rooster arrived, it was almost dark. The streets were brightly lit, even more lively than during the day.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The storyteller slammed the gavel heavily, raising his voice: “This is precisely where the Goddess's infatuation stirs up trouble, and the Azure Bird's confusion invites disaster. If you wish to know what happens next, please listen to the next chapter!”</p><p>“Oh! It's over again!”</p><p>“We have to wait until tomorrow again!”</p><p>“Ending it at such a place every day, he's truly heartless!”</p><p>…</p><p>The crowd awakened as if from a dream.</p><p>Sporadic cheers echoed through the teahouse, followed by more complaints, and some pleaded with the storyteller to continue for a bit longer.</p><p>“I'm sorry, everyone, it's getting late. Please come back tomorrow.”</p><p>The storyteller's heart was as hard as iron. He took a sip from his teacup, packed up his things, and went into the back room.</p><p>The tea patrons had no choice but to leave with sighs.</p><p>“Take your time!”</p><p>“You take your time!”</p><p>…</p><p>The teahouse attendant, having held his tongue all day, finally dared to speak. After seeing the tea patrons off, he noticed the young lady who arrived last was still sitting there, motionless.</p><p>“Miss, haven't you heard enough? The storyteller will be here promptly at the Snake hour tomorrow. If you come again tomorrow, I'll save you a good seat.”</p><p>Compared to the other patrons, the young lady was the one truly awakening from a dream.</p><p>It was an incredibly realistic dream; she had experienced everything the Celestial Goddess had, vividly and distinctly.</p><p>But the young lady didn't realize anything was amiss. Feeling unfulfilled, she stretched, “Where can I find lodging nearby?”</p><p>“You're not a local?”</p><p>The attendant thought to himself, the storyteller's charm is indeed great; someone is even staying the night just to listen to the story.</p><p>The young lady’s elegant demeanor and attire clearly indicated a wealthy background. The attendant gestured towards the east end of the street, “The Drunken Fragrance Inn next to the City God Temple also offers lodging, but they don't have many rooms. I'm not sure if there are any vacancies now.  The few inns next to the Drunken Fragrance Inn are a bit less luxurious, but they're all clean. You can choose one that suits your fancy.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the deities and ghosts also left the teahouse.</p><p>Including Yu Chenghuang, none of them noticed anything strange about the situation. They even forgot to investigate the young lady, and as they left, everyone was discussing the story.</p><p>Two ghostly officials on patrol passed by, saw their colleagues coming out of the teahouse, greeted them, and asked, "Did you catch the troublemaker? Judge Wu even used the Mountain Quelling Spirit Banner, why didn't we hear anything?"</p><p>“Amazing! It was bloody amazing!”</p><p>Their colleague suddenly slapped his thigh.</p><p>The two ghostly officials were startled by their colleague's reaction. After a moment of stunned silence, they asked, "What was amazing? Where's the storyteller? Did Lord Chenghuang execute him on the spot?"</p><p>“The storyteller? He'll be here promptly at the Rooster hour tomorrow morning. I have to remember the time, mustn’t miss it," their colleague mumbled, his answer completely irrelevant. He then grabbed the other colleague and began discussing the story animatedly.</p><p>The Celestial Soldiers and Generals were portrayed as adversaries to the Goddess in the story.</p><p>Their stance was diametrically opposed to the young lady who sympathized with the Goddess; they all agreed that the Heavenly Court's laws were inviolable.</p><p>The two confused ghostly officials sought out other colleagues, who all reacted similarly.</p><p>Looking at their entranced colleagues, the two ghostly officials exchanged glances, a sudden chill running down their spines.</p><p>They stood frozen for a moment, then, instead of returning directly to the yamen, went to the city gate and told the gatekeeping ghosts about their discovery.</p><p>By now, there were very few ghosts and deities in Jin County who hadn't been to the teahouse.</p><p>"Did you see Lord Chenghuang? Did he react the same way?"</p><p>The gatekeeping ghost asked the two officials.</p><p>"When we arrived, the Lords had already entered the yamen. We didn't dare follow them.  Should we send someone in to take a look?" the ghostly official whispered.</p><p>They all looked at each other, but no one responded.</p><p>"Let's go together, leaving one behind. In case we're all wiped out, there'll be someone to spread the word. Let's draw lots," one ghostly official acted decisively, grabbing a few straws, marking them, and half-concealing them in his hand.</p><p>In the end, one ghost drew the winning straw and watched his colleagues go.</p><p>The remaining ghosts and deities returned to the City God Temple, gazing at the building that represented divine authority and the boundary between Yin and Yang. In the past, this place had been their strongest support, but now it had become a den of tigers and dragons.</p><p>With solemn expressions, the ghosts and deities stepped into the yamen, tiptoeing towards the main hall.</p><p>“There's no one inside…”</p><p>They then went to the other departments.</p><p>“The Lords of the various departments are all absent…”</p><p>They gathered, looking at each other in bewilderment. Lord Chenghuang and the Civil Judge were the most diligent, and they should have been in the main hall handling official business at this time.</p><p>"Hiss, could it be…"</p><p>A ghostly official gasped, only to have his mouth covered by a colleague.</p><p>“Shhh!”</p><p>The ghosts and deities quietly withdrew from the City God Temple, returned to the city gate, and gathered together, their faces filled with worry.</p><p>"What's the background of this storyteller? Has anyone paid attention to him?" a ghostly official broke the silence.</p><p>Everyone shook their heads.</p><p>"I say," the ghost who had stayed behind looked around, "Could it be that we're overthinking this? If this storyteller is truly so powerful that even Lord Chenghuang has fallen prey, how could you all return completely unscathed?"</p><p>"Right, why would he spare us alone?" the ghostly official said in a daze.</p><p>"I specifically went out of the city just now, all the way to Nine Sons Mountain, and no one stopped me," the ghost continued, "Unless he deliberately let us out to spread the word."</p><p>"There are indeed no external injuries on Old Wang and the others, and there are no traces of a magical duel in the teahouse…"</p><p>The two ghostly officials who first discovered the situation were now hesitant.</p><p>"If the storyteller truly possesses such power, it means he deliberately spared us. No matter what we do, the outcome won't be any different.  To report to the prefecture city, we need to know exactly what happened, otherwise what can we say? Perhaps we truly are overthinking it. Let's wait until tomorrow morning to observe the situation."</p><p>The ghosts and deities finally came to an agreement.</p><p>They dared not enter the city all night, enduring the entire night at the city gate.</p><p>The next day, at the Snake hour.</p><p>The storyteller arrived as promised. Fifteen minutes earlier, the young lady had already ordered tea and snacks, waiting.  The ghosts and deities from yesterday were all present, not a single one missing.</p><p>"Last time, we spoke of the Goddess's infatuation and the Azure Bird's confusion, which angered the Heavenly Mother..."</p><p>New Year's Eve.</p><p>The most lively day of the year, the peak of human prosperity.</p><p>This atmosphere was extremely beneficial for the cultivation of ghosts and deities, but the ghostly officials eavesdropping outside the teahouse felt a chill in their hearts, without any thought for cultivation.</p><p>The storyteller's powerful voice echoed from within the teahouse, and there were no other sounds.</p><p>The ghosts and deities of Jin County, from the Chenghuang to the lowest ghost soldier, became the most loyal audience.</p><p>The ghostly officials remained three zhang away from the teahouse, not daring to approach, and quietly retreated back to the city gate.</p><p>Waiting at the city gate were not only the few ghosts and deities from last night, but all the mountain gods and earth deities within Jin County had been summoned.</p><p>Just listening to the ghostly officials' descriptions sent chills down the spines of the ghosts and deities.</p><p>They looked back at Jin County City, the familiar city transformed into a dragon's pool and tiger's den.</p><p>The mortals, however, were completely unaware, celebrating the New Year with great joy, firecrackers occasionally exploding within the city.</p><p>Another ghostly official emerged from the city.</p><p>"I've found out. The storyteller stays at the Drunken Fragrance Inn at night, just like ordinary people. He uses silver for lodging and meals. There's only one peculiar thing: he has the Drunken Fragrance Feast every night."</p><p>Hearing this, the ghosts and deities were stirred.</p><p>"Is this person an old friend of the Drunken Fragrance Inn's owner?"</p><p>It was well known that the owner of the Drunken Fragrance Inn had an eccentric temperament. Even Lord Chenghuang couldn't have the Drunken Fragrance Feast often, yet he prepared it for the storyteller every night.</p><p>"I… didn't dare use magic on the owner of the Drunken Fragrance Inn, nor did I appear to inquire directly.  It seems the owner only recently met the storyteller," the ghostly official hesitated.</p><p>Everyone knew what he was worried about; they wouldn't dare either.</p><p>"This matter is beyond our ability to handle. Since he allowed us to spread the word, let's fulfill his wish. It's a pity that the Lords are all trapped and cannot use treasures to transmit messages. We can only ask a brother to personally run to the prefecture city and report the situation.  When reporting, you must make it clear that the other party is fearless, and I'm afraid even the prefecture city may find it difficult to cope."</p><p>The most prestigious ghostly official looked around, noticing the strange expression on a certain Earth Deity's face.</p><p>"Brother Yue, do you know something?"</p><p>This person was the Earth Deity of the area where Qingyang Temple was located, named Yue Wenf.</p><p>At this moment, he was thinking about what happened yesterday.</p><p>After Chenghuang and the Civil Judge visited Qingyang Temple and gave him some instructions, they returned to the city and this incident occurred.</p><p>Could it be just a coincidence?</p><p>However, Yue Wenfu didn't reveal this.</p><p>Daoist Qingfeng was experiencing the mortal world, living in seclusion at Qingyang Temple, and definitely didn't want to be disturbed. Even Chenghuang and the Civil Judge had specifically instructed him so.</p><p>Even if Daoist Qingfeng had nothing to do with this matter, asking for his help might help Jin County overcome this calamity.</p><p>"There is indeed something, but I cannot speak of it. I must return quickly, excuse me…"</p><p>Yue Wenfu said hastily and used his earth-遁 technique to escape.</p><p>The remaining ghosts and deities looked at each other in bewilderment, having no choice but to continue according to their plan.</p><p>Yue Wenfu didn't stop for a moment, hurrying back to Seven Rows Village. He tidied his clothes at the foot of the mountain and walked up the mountain as a sign of respect.</p><p>The sun was shining brightly, not as cold as yesterday.</p><p>Despite it being New Year's Eve, there were still patients coming up the mountain seeking medicine.</p><p>Entering the Daoist temple, Yue Wenfu saw Qin Sang taking the pulse of an elderly man. Yulang and Xiaowu had set up a brazier in the main hall, warming themselves by the fire with the other patients.</p><p>"Wenf pays his respects to Daoist."</p><p>Yue Wenfu walked to Qin Sang's side and respectfully bowed. He wanted to speak, but Qin Sang only hummed in acknowledgment, continuing to diagnose the elderly man.</p><p>He could only suppress his anxiety, watching as Qin Sang slowly explained the illness to the elderly man, then wrote a prescription, grabbed the medicine, explained the precautions and how to take it, picked up the brush, licked the ink, recorded the transaction, and finally accepted the elderly man's profuse thanks.</p><p>Before Yue Wenfu could speak, the next patient immediately sat down.</p><p>After nearly half an hour, the last patient was finally seen off.</p><p>“Daoist…”</p><p>Yue Wenfu was already burning with anxiety.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand and said to Yulang, "Yulang, go down the mountain and borrow two horses from Scholar Chen. We're going into the city today."</p><p>“We're going to the city!”</p><p>Yulang cheered and dashed down the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang then said to Xiaowu, "Xiaowu, stay here and watch the house."</p><p>Xiaowu didn't ask why and nodded slightly.</p><p>"Let's go," Qin Sang called to Yue Wenfu and strode down the mountain.</p><p>Yue Wenfu realized that Daoist Qingfeng was going to intervene, and his heart was filled with ecstasy. He hurriedly followed.</p><p>‘Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!’</p><p>The rapid sound of hooves echoed on the official road.</p><p>Two Daoists galloped on horseback, attracting the attention of passersby.</p><p>The speed of galloping horses was no match for his earth-遁 technique. Yue Wenfu easily kept pace, but dared not urge, sighing inwardly that Daoist Qingfeng was truly immersed in his role.</p><p>Yue Wenfu arrived first and told the ghosts and deities to retreat.</p><p>The master and disciple galloped to the Jin County city gate, tied their horses to the wooden posts outside the city, and entered on foot.</p><p>“So lively!”</p><p>Yulang took a deep breath, the air filled with the aroma of various foods, intoxicating.</p><p>He had been born in a mountain village and had few opportunities to enter the city.</p><p>His most vivid memory was the last time his father took him to the city for the temple fair, which was as lively as today.</p><p>Although he had entered the mountains to cultivate the Dao, this memory became increasingly poignant, perhaps never to fade.</p><p>In his memory, there was not only his father, but also the brilliant fireworks of the human world.</p><p>“Master, why didn't Senior Sister come? I want to buy Senior Sister a gift,” Yulang looked up and said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s choose as we walk.”</p><p>Qin Sang acted as if he was truly here to stroll, leisurely wandering the streets with Yulang, looking here and there, making Yue Wenfu behind them nearly die of anxiety.</p><p>The goods were dazzling.</p><p>Yulang was almost overwhelmed by the choices.</p><p>They strolled all the way to Temple Front Street, where Qin Sang slowly stopped in front of the teahouse.</p><p>Yulang saw his master stop, listened attentively for a moment, peeked through the curtains to see the scene inside, and asked in confusion, “Master, is the story that good?”</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and commented, “It’s a story full of cliches.”</p><p>At this time, the storyteller was talking about the great battle between the Goddess, the Azure Bird, and the three Star Lords.</p><p>When the crisis arrived, the Goddess and the Azure Bird unexpectedly discovered an ancient immortal's cave dwelling, greatly increasing their strength.  They engaged in a fierce battle with the three Star Lords within the cave.</p><p>This battle was exceptionally intense.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, the cave dwelling was actually an ancient immortal’s demon-sealing grounds. A peerless fiend was sealed underground, and the seal was gradually being broken by the magic of both sides, but neither side noticed.</p><p>“Suddenly, a thunderclap echoed through the clear sky, and smoke and dust billowed from the depths of the cave dwelling. Then, with a crack, the entire mountain split from the middle, startling both sides into ceasing their fight. Rolling demonic smoke surged from the fissure, and maniacal laughter resounded from the depths of the earth, shaking heaven and earth. The peerless fiend emerged! The Goddess's single act of willfulness ultimately brought calamity upon the world!”</p><p>The storyteller spoke with passionate fervor, suddenly flicking his folding fan towards the main entrance.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The minds of the mortals and ghosts and deities within the hall were captivated by the storyteller and they all turned to look at the teahouse entrance.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance with his hands behind his back, unmoved, and said calmly, “If this poor Daoist hadn’t appeared, would fellow Daoist intend to detain all the ghosts and deities of this region before ceasing?”</p><p>“Hahaha… This humble one cannot bear such karmic consequences, and I believe fellow Daoist wouldn’t stand idly by and watch the world descend into chaos.”</p><p>The storyteller laughed heartily, stepped down from the platform, gently swayed his folding fan, and walked towards the teahouse entrance.</p><p>As he passed, the tea patrons were brushed by the wind from his fan and instantly awoke from their long dream, completely regaining their senses.</p><p>The storyteller lifted the curtain, walked out of the teahouse, closed his fan, and cupped his hands, "This one is Qingyuan.”</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
