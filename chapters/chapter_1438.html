<h1></h1><p>The three spirit insects had consumed the Myriad Spirit Fruit.</p><p>Qin Sang released them outside and observed them for a while, but he didn't detect any obvious changes.</p><p>The Myriad Spirit Fruit didn't directly enhance the spirit insects' cultivation. According to Valley Master Mu, its benefits were manifested in their spirituality . This was the most invaluable aspect, and it was also the reason it could increase the success rate of the Spirit Ascension Ritual.</p><p>"We need to wait for them to fully digest the medicinal power to see the changes."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, allowing them to slumber.</p><p>Next, he resealed the remaining Myriad Spirit Fruit and took out the tree root segment.</p><p>The severed root contained spirituality .</p><p>If nurtured properly, it could yield a new Myriad Spirit Fruit tree, providing a continuous source of Myriad Spirit Fruit.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had no idea how to cultivate a Myriad Spirit Fruit tree. The growth cycle of this kind of spirit tree was definitely extremely long. Even if he successfully cultivated it, he didn't know when it would bear fruit.</p><p>"I'll have to look up relevant information when I have the chance."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself. He walked out of the meditation chamber, found the area with the densest spiritual energy in the cave, and set up the most conservative spiritual herb nurturing restriction, placing the severed root down.</p><p>This place was secluded. He'd nurture the severed root here for now and take it back to the Azure Goat Temple when he returned.</p><p>Then, he returned to the meditation chamber and took out five jade boxes.</p><p>Each of the five jade boxes contained a spirit herb. Including the one he gave to Tan Hao, there were a total of six, all rare spirit herbs that were difficult to buy with spirit stones outside.</p><p>Among them, the Spirit Lamp Flower was the most valuable.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to ask someone to refine it into a Hidden Fragrance Pill, which could enhance one's divine sense, for his own consumption.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had deliberately disguised himself in the secret passage, the Mixed Demon Old Man couldn't be certain that it was his doing. However, this kind of old demon always preferred to kill by mistake rather than let one go.</p><p>Qin Sang urgently needed to continue to improve his strength.</p><p>Advancing the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* to the second layer was the quickest way.</p><p>Divine Sense Transformation, comparable to a Great cultivator, would mean that even if he stood before the Mixed Demon Old Man, he wouldn't have to worry about his disguise being seen through.</p><p>The Fire Lotus Seed had already taken shape. Qin Sang had been refining Demonic Flame, and breaking through was only a matter of time. Taking the Hidden Fragrance Pill could speed up the process.</p><p>The remaining four spirit herbs were not spirit herbs that directly improved cultivation or strength. Each had its own unique function, but none were urgently needed by Qin Sang.</p><p>It would be best to use them to trade for treasures he needed.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly thought of the Myriad Demon Assembly nine years later.</p><p>Originally, Qin Sang had already decided to participate in the Myriad Demon Assembly. After this incident, he had to carefully consider it.</p><p>This grand trading event among Core Formation cultivators was bound to see countless rare treasures appear: materials for the Golden Submerged Sword, spiritual objects for the Spirit Ascension Ritual, and all kinds of peculiar cultivation arts and secret techniques, all of which he had a chance to obtain there.</p><p>He needed to prepare for breaking through to the late Core Formation stage. He wouldn't refuse any secret techniques that could improve his chances of breaking through.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had spirit herbs in his possession that could be used for trading, and it would be a shame to miss out.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that even the Hundred Flowers Valley didn't have many of these precious spiritual objects for the Spirit Ascension Ritual. Even if he took out the Myriad Spirit Fruit, he would be lucky to exchange it for one set from the Hundred Flowers Valley, and he needed at least two sets.</p><p>One for the Fire Jade Centipede and one for the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>But the location of the Myriad Demon Assembly was Mixed Demon Island, the Mixed Demon Old Man's lair!</p><p>Tan Hao needed to cultivate in seclusion for several more decades before daring to attempt a breakthrough and wouldn't have time to participate in the Myriad Demon Assembly. As a Golden Core cultivator, he couldn't represent Qin Sang in the top-tier trading event.</p><p>The Myriad Demon Assembly was the biggest event in the Boundless Sea. Even Nascent Soul cultivators and Demon Kings from other regions would be attracted to it. It was impossible for the Mixed Demon Old Man to completely control it, right?</p><p>Qin Sang tapped the jade box in his hand with his finger, a pensive look on his face, preparing to wait until he had gathered more information before making a decision.</p><p>He changed the sealing method according to the characteristics of each spirit herb before taking out the three magical artifacts he had obtained in the Buddhist temple.</p><p>The Demon Subduing Pestle had already been analyzed with Tan Hao.</p><p>Qin Sang placed it aside for now, planning to try to re-refine it later and change its form.</p><p>The pearl and the seven-story pagoda were placed in front of him.</p><p>Both treasures were incomparably pure, evoking contemplation.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted, landing on the pearl, which he grasped in his hand.</p><p>"Wish-Fulfilling Pearl…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured silently.</p><p>He had already probed it on the way. When he probed the pearl with his divine sense, these four words automatically appeared in his mind. It should be the pearl's name, but there was no detailed introduction. Qin Sang needed to explore it himself.</p><p>He held the pearl in his hand, his eyes slightly closed, focusing on analyzing it.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression twitched slightly. The Wish-Fulfilling Pearl in his palm suddenly changed. The inside seemed to have ripples of water, followed by a sudden burst of intense golden light.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang seemed to have acquired some Buddhist nature, becoming a cultivator bathed in Buddha's light.</p><p>The change had not yet stopped. Golden light surged, forming a circular, pale golden qi shield around him without Qin Sang's control, enveloping him within it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the qi shield was teetering and only lasted for three breaths before shattering silently. The Wish-Fulfilling Pearl immediately dimmed, returning to its original appearance.</p><p>This was because the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl had not yet been completely refined by Qin Sang.</p><p>After several attempts, Qin Sang finally managed to forcibly maintain the qi shield.</p><p>He looked at the pale golden qi shield around him and pondered, "It's not an offensive magical artifact, and it doesn't seem to have any special effect. Could it be…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he summoned the Golden Submerged Sword, splitting off a ray of sword energy and stabbing it at himself.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The sword energy was blocked, and the qi shield shattered in response.</p><p>Then, after some exploration, Qin Sang roughly figured it out.</p><p>The Wish-Fulfilling Pearl was not the peculiar magical artifact that Qin Sang had hoped for. It was a defensive magical artifact!</p><p>This was still a pretty good result. After the Nine Lives Mysterious Turtle Shell was used to refine the Sun God Tree, Qin Sang was lacking such a life-saving treasure.</p><p>The best defensive magical artifacts were those that could sense danger and automatically protect their masters.</p><p>The Wish-Fulfilling Pearl was not of this type, but it could be stored in the *dantian*. As long as Qin Sang thought about it, he could immediately release the qi shield.</p><p>The problem was that Qin Sang couldn't even tell the grade of the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl!</p><p>He considered his own attainments in the art of refining treasures to be not low.</p><p>"It's a bit strange. Could it be because it's a Buddhist treasure? The refining methods mastered by Buddhism aren't the same as what I've learned?"</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl with his palm. "I'll have to wait until I've finished refining it to know its true power. It shouldn't be too long."</p><p>He refined it slightly and stored the pearl in his *dantian*, accompanying his Nascent Soul.</p><p>When he picked up the seven-story pagoda, he realized that this thing was even stranger than the pearl.</p><p>"This isn't a magical artifact?"</p><p>Qin Sang's astonished voice echoed in the meditation chamber.</p><p>Just now, he had used various methods: divine sense, true essence, and even manifested his demon body. The seven-story pagoda remained unresponsive, lying quietly in his palm.</p><p>The light emitted by the seven-story pagoda remained the same, without the slightest fluctuation. Qin Sang couldn't help but suspect that this light originated from the material of the seven-story pagoda itself.</p><p>Even a Buddhist treasure that must be used by Buddhist cultivators shouldn't behave like this.</p><p>Unfortunately, he knew too little about Buddhism.</p><p>Could it not be a magical artifact?</p><p>Qin Sang repeated this question in his mind.</p><p>He had risked great danger to obtain such a thing. Qin Sang was somewhat unwilling to accept it. He tried again with various methods, but the result was still the same.</p><p>This path was impassable. He could only start with the Pure Sea Sect and the Buddhist temple.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the information he had learned from Tan Hao, as well as the furnishings in the Buddhist temple.</p>
