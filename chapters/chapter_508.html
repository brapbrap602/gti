<h1>Chapter 501: Human Effort Has Limits, Don't Force Anything</h1><p>After all, it's the most effective spirit herb in the current cultivation world for forming a Gold Core. Even a naturally gifted dual-spiritual root prodigy wouldn't pass up the chance to obtain it.  Every bit of hope is another possibility.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A streak of light suddenly shot out from the crack in the door. It flashed before Qin Sang, then split into three, speeding off in different directions.</p><p>Three!</p><p>Qin Sang was glad he hadn't returned directly to his sect. Otherwise, facing the pressure of three Gold Core cultivators, whether he could keep the spirit herbs was uncertain. Although he ultimately failed, he wouldn't hand over the opportunity to others.</p><p>Silence reigned in the cave dwelling for a moment before Qi Yuanhu's voice echoed out again, "What are your plans now?"</p><p>What are my plans?</p><p>A trace of melancholy surfaced in Qin Sang's eyes. He bowed respectfully and said, "Please, Master Qi, give me some guidance. Is there still a chance for me... to form a Gold Core?"</p><p>Qi Yuanhu didn't answer directly. "Tell me in detail how your cultivation changed when you consumed those two spirit herbs. What insights did you gain?"</p><p>"After consuming the spirit herbs, the effect was slightly better than the Kanli Gold Core..."</p><p>Qi Yuanhu still didn't open the cave. Qin Sang stood outside, facing the stone door, recounting every change in his body from the moment he took the herbs until their potency was exhausted.  He didn't dare conceal anything; his future was at stake.</p><p>"Five spiritual roots..."</p><p>Qi Yuanhu sighed softly. "It seems that spirit fruit didn't completely break the limitations of your talent..."</p><p>He even knows this?</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised. A casual, almost joking excuse he made while chatting with Senior Brother Wen had actually reached Qi Yuanhu's ears.  He hadn't expected Qi Yuanhu to pay so much attention to him.</p><p>"Talent..."</p><p>Qin Sang was unwilling to accept this. "Is there truly no path left for me? Do any of the other Masters have Gold Core formation methods they could teach me? I'm willing to do anything!"</p><p>He had three Ten Yama Banners. Since Half-Ghost Ancestor's Ten Yama Banners were already half destroyed, and it was impossible to complete the formation, one banner would be enough. Even a Gold Core cultivator from Shaohua Mountain couldn't refuse the allure of a magical treasure, right?</p><p>He also had the iron ring left by Dove Robe Daoist.</p><p>He wasn't greedy; he only sought to form a Gold Core. For Gold Core cultivators, exchanging a Gold Core formation method for a magical treasure was a profitable deal. They definitely wouldn't refuse.</p><p>He could use all these things!</p><p>As for the Nine Phantasmal Orchid, unless he was truly desperate, Qin Sang would never exchange it. This spirit herb represented a glimmer of hope for reaching Nascent Soul.</p><p>Having come this far, as long as he could form a Gold Core, the Nascent Soul stage wasn't out of reach.</p><p>Qi Yuanhu chuckled. "If there were so-called superior Gold Core formation methods, would they still covet your Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower? The current cultivation world is but a fragmented remnant of the ancient golden age, where heavenly treasures were abundant, and secret inheritances were plentiful. These two spirit herbs are the best that can be found today. If it weren't for the inter-realm competition, would they have fallen into your hands? You consumed them, yet the effect was only this much. Even if you obtained other spirit herbs, what then?"</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent.</p><p>After a period of silence, Qi Yuanhu's tone softened, and he said faintly,</p><p>"I'll give you two pieces of advice, which are also the insights I've gained from guarding Skull Ridge Pass for decades.</p><p>"First, human effort has limits; don't force anything.</p><p>"Failing to form a Gold Core and dying with regrets is not uncommon throughout history. Countless dual and triple-spiritual root cultivators have met this fate, let alone you.</p><p>"Don't let obsession lead you down the demonic path. I don't want to personally cleanse the sect of you.</p><p>"Second, everyone has their own destiny.</p><p>"You, with five spiritual roots, reached the Pseudo Gold Core stage in a hundred years, a miracle in the eyes of others.  Only those who know the truth understand that since you could endure the 'Mysterious Feminine Jade Cauldron Scripture' in the early Foundation Establishment stage and withstand the pain of the 'Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter,' it's only natural you could cultivate these two techniques. These techniques are part of your destiny.</p><p>"In the future, there might be another opportunity that will help you form a Gold Core.</p><p>"However… as time passes, those who see no hope often lose their fighting spirit. You might as well ask yourself, is your Dao heart firm?"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head and replied without hesitation, "My heart is set on the Great Dao!"</p><p>Qi Yuanhu hummed in response.</p><p>"In that case, I'll give you a Skull Guard token. Take this token to Skull Ridge Pass, join the Skull Guard, and gain some experience.</p><p>"Three years later, when the Spirit Tide nears its end, you can use your Skull Guard identity to justifiably be among the first to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and patrol the secret realms.</p><p>"At that time, as the Spirit Tide recedes, some hidden restrictions will reveal themselves. If you're lucky enough to find a few newly opened secret realms and be the first to enter, you might encounter a world-changing opportunity and defy your fate.</p><p>"During these three years, you don't need to go out to resist the Cloud Beast Tide. Stay within the pass. Since you've already reached the Pseudo Gold Core stage, there's no need to cultivate desperately. Immerse yourself in the mortal world and experience the joys of mortals. There are many interesting things to be found..."</p><p>A streak of light flew out of the cave and landed in Qin Sang's palm. The light dissipated, revealing a Skull Guard token.</p><p>Three years.</p><p>Qin Sang grasped the token, noting the timeframe in Qi Yuanhu's words.</p><p>In three years, the Spirit Tide would reach its peak and then recede.</p><p>The third year was also when the Violet Palace would open.</p><p>The sudden cessation of hostilities during the intense inter-realm war must be related to the opening of the Violet Palace. This timing was roughly in line with Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>Pondering this, Qin Sang looked down at the token. He had seen a Skull Guard token from Jade Sun Zi, and this one was identical, signifying the rank of captain.</p><p>Since the Spirit Tide arrived, the Upper Yuan Serenity Palace's ancient teleportation formation had been continuously active, teleporting groups as soon as enough people gathered. Therefore, there was no need to rush.</p><p>However, the sooner he reached Skull Ridge Pass, the better.</p><p>His agreements with Granny Jing and Wandering Scholar required careful planning and early preparation.</p><p>With this token, he wouldn't have to worry about being suddenly conscripted to hunt Cloud Beasts after entering Skull Ridge Pass.  Moreover, after the Spirit Tide receded, he could be among the first to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to seek opportunities.</p><p>This was a significant favor; Qi Yuanhu had truly put in effort.</p><p>Qin Sang was grateful. He said respectfully, "I will remember Master Qi's kindness."</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Qi Yuanhu began to speak, then hesitated, sighing almost imperceptibly. He suddenly and decisively issued a dismissal order, "I will be in secluded cultivation from now on and won't see anyone. Take the token and go to Skull Ridge Pass quickly. Don't delay too long. From now on… take care of yourself! Go!"</p><p>"Sigh..."</p><p>Qin Sang was caught off guard. He suddenly felt his body tighten, and then the scene before him blurred as he was teleported to the foot of the mountain.</p><p>He saw the mist close, concealing the green peak.</p><p>Gao Yang stood in the mist, waved to Qin Sang, and hurried back.</p><p>Qin Sang had no choice but to give up for now. He would ask Qi Yuanhu for guidance when the opportunity arose.</p><p>Flying away from the sect, Qin Sang arrived at an unnamed mountain and stood on its peak for a day and a night.</p><p>He watched the sun rise and set, the moon wax and wane.</p><p>His gaze gradually grew resolute.</p>
