<h1>Chapter 1413: The Patterns of the Spirit Array</h1><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>…</p><p>Within the cracks of the Thousand Buddha Wall, a figure was fleeing frantically. Behind him, a surging tide of golden-red flames, a fusion of Buddhist light and fiery inferno, relentlessly pursued.</p><p>Qin Sang, wielding the Golden Sinking Sword, forged a path forward, not daring to pause.</p><p>After retaliating against the Mixed Demon Elder with a blast of demonic fire, he turned and fled, unsure of the attack's effect or whether it bought Mu Valley Master and the others any time to escape.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The sound of sword light impacting echoed continuously.</p><p>Qin Sang went deeper and deeper.</p><p>His vision remained dominated by the two colors: golden-red.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how much fiery energy had accumulated here over countless years.  Even after such prolonged release, so much remained.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected the original spirit array wasn't this powerful. The fiery energy had altered the array, dramatically increasing its potency.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang noticed a dimming of the light ahead, instantly raising his guard.</p><p>He slashed forward with all his might.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The sword light cleaved through the Buddhist light and fiery flames, allowing Qin Sang to burst forth.</p><p>The next instant, the pressure on him lessened, the light became less intense, and the monotonous golden-red gave way to vibrant, multicolored rays.</p><p>Even stranger, the violent energy behind him vanished at the same time.</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. He turned to examine his surroundings.</p><p>It was the same as before.</p><p>His current location was suspended in nothingness, without any ground beneath his feet.</p><p>Multicolored rays filled the void, some forming vast swathes, others coalescing into dense clusters.  The various colors were breathtaking, but the familiar fiery energy permeated every ray.</p><p>Everything felt ethereal and intangible.</p><p>He couldn't see any solid objects.</p><p>Clearly, Qin Sang's previous guess was correct: passing through the Thousand Buddha Wall was merely a transition from one form of the spirit array to another.</p><p>He was still within the array.</p><p>But surprisingly, the Thousand Buddha Wall was gone behind him!</p><p>He had just burst through it, yet it had vanished without a trace.  Behind him stretched an endless expanse of multicolored rays, devoid of any familiar sight.</p><p>“This… I’ve fallen into another layer of the spirit array?”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>He remained still, observing intently alongside the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>No matter how powerful a spirit array, there would be patterns to follow.  Especially since this array was ownerless, its variations must be limited.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp tearing sound cut through the multicolored rays.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed. He felt a stinging sensation on his skin, as though locked onto by something acutely sharp, triggering a premonition of danger.  Instantly, he raised the Golden Sinking Sword, poised for battle.</p><p>*Hum…*</p><p>The spirit sword hummed.</p><p>The tearing sound grew closer, its speed alarming.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang saw the rays in that direction vanish, revealing a black hole.  An incredibly brilliant golden light, radiating an aura of destruction, hurtled towards him!</p><p>This golden light was utterly pure.  Since entering the array, every scene Qin Sang had witnessed contained fiery energy, except for this light.</p><p>Therefore, this was likely the array's original attack method.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, he didn't dare to be careless, and fully activated the Golden Sinking Sword, about to unleash a strike to meet the golden light head-on.</p><p>Suddenly, his eyes flickered. He seemed to think of something, hesitated, and made a strange move – he retracted the Golden Sinking Sword and shifted his body several dozen meters to the side.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The golden light struck, faintly revealing its true form: a staff seemingly formed by the spirit array.</p><p>Qin Sang’s evasive maneuver caused the staff to alter course.</p><p>It shifted slightly, but only a few meters, failing to intercept Qin Sang before it passed him by and vanished into the multicolored rays.</p><p>The impact of the staff's energy wave caused slight ripples in Qin Sang's protective aura, but that was all.</p><p>He himself was unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the place where the staff disappeared, exhaled, and thought, "As I suspected!  With the original array, that staff would not have been so easily avoided.  If someone were controlling it externally, it would be even harder to deal with.  Now, the array is affected by the fiery energy; it has excessive power but lacks flexibility.  It looks dangerous, but it's actually quite manageable…”</p><p>This initial test confirmed Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>Of course, this didn't mean he could become complacent.</p><p>There were bound to be places like the Thousand Buddha Wall, inescapable and even more dangerous than before.</p><p>It seems I've transitioned from the first stage of the spirit formation to the second.  It's like a series of trials; I wonder how many there are?</p><p>The Hunmo Elder surely didn't follow us in from the very beginning, otherwise, the Sky-Eye Butterflies would have detected him.  This suggests that all intruders face similar challenges.</p><p>If Guzhu Mu hadn't perished, after passing through the Thousand Buddha Wall, he would have also reached this 'space,' though not necessarily near me.  And where is the Thousand Buddha Wall now?</p><p>The Thousand Buddha Wall must have been a manifestation of the barrier between the two stages of the spirit formation.  Since I emerged from it, I should be able to find it if I go back, though the view from inside and outside might be different. It may not even look like the Thousand Buddha Wall anymore.</p><p>Qin Sang calmed himself, analyzing what he had seen and heard, pondering the patterns of the spirit formation.</p><p>As he was lost in thought, the Sky-Eye Butterflies transmitted a mental message, seeming to have discovered something.</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the depths of the radiant glow, his figure flashing repeatedly.</p><p>Within the glow, red flames danced.  Touching even one could likely trigger a large-scale disturbance.</p><p>If the formation's attacks couldn't be avoided, things would be far more difficult.</p><p>The radiant glow extended endlessly, the red flames filling the sky, like a fiery sunset.</p><p>Qin Sang moved slowly, sometimes approaching the glow to examine it closely, sometimes frowning in thought.</p><p>Gradually, a look of resignation appeared on his face.</p><p>"The patterns here are completely different from the Thousand Buddha Wall. The fiery aura and the glow are inseparable. By the time I figure out the patterns and open a path back, it'll all be too late..."</p><p>Going back to rescue others is impractical.</p><p>If he returned and Guzhu Mu had already been killed by the Hunmo Elder, he would only be putting himself in greater danger.</p><p>"Waiting here for rescue offers little hope. The formation is so complex; the creator clearly intends to move intruders to different locations and defeat them one by one.  Furthermore, it's uncertain if Guzhu Mu even managed to escape into this place…"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, and he decided to wait a little longer.</p><p>The result was as expected.</p><p>"Three of you, you're on your own."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly and turned to leave.</p><p>He couldn't think of a better solution.  For now, he could only proceed alone and explore the Jinghai Sect.  If Guzhu Mu escapes the Hunmo Elder, they will meet again at the Jinghai Sect.</p><p>Fortunately, the Fire Jade Centipedes, Qin Sang's spirit insects, were guiding his way.</p><p>Obtaining the Myriad Spirits Fruit would make the trip worthwhile.</p><p>As for other treasures, he would have to act accordingly.</p>
