<h1>Chapter 1751: The Wolf Demon</h1><p>The wolf demon resembled a dog in appearance, but its front legs were short and thin. Fearing that the middle-aged Taoist priest might uncover its true form, it could only crawl close to the ground, using its two hind legs to sprint. Despite this, its speed was not slow.</p><p>Suddenly exposed, the wolf demon froze momentarily, then, with its legs spinning like wheels, it summoned a demonic wind and bolted toward the dense forest ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang followed leisurely, his gaze fixed on the wolf demon with a hint of curiosity.</p><p>Earlier at Bailong Crossing, the aura he had sensed from the grass was likely this demon's. Its aura was comparable to that of a transformed-stage great demon, making it the true master of the altar. It had been manipulating the giant wolf from the shadows, showcasing its profound magical abilities.</p><p>However, the wolf demon's aura had now significantly weakened, barely reaching the early stage of a demon core.</p><p>Qin Sang had followed it for a while, confirming that it wasn't injured or suffering from any other affliction. Instead, its cultivation had regressed.</p><p>The giant wolf and the wolf demon shared the same aura, suggesting they were one entity. Their cultivation levels could even be transferred between them, a fact that had eluded even the middle-aged Taoist priest.</p><p>Seeing the wolf demon still fleeing, Qin Sang lightly tapped the ground with his foot, effortlessly catching up to it. With a casual gesture, he grabbed the wolf demon by the scruff of its neck, rendering it immobile.</p><p>After moving far from human habitation, Qin Sang found a flat rock to settle on and casually tossed the wolf demon down.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>The wolf demon hit the ground, its eyes tightly shut, body stiff as if lifeless.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke indifferently, "I know you can understand human speech. If you don't want me to use soul-searching techniques, answer my questions honestly."</p><p>The wolf demon trembled, opened its eyes, and rolled them rapidly. It quickly flipped over and knelt, kowtowing repeatedly, "Immortal, spare me! Immortal, spare me! This humble demon is willing to serve you faithfully. Whatever you wish to know, I will tell you everything."</p><p>This demon was cunning but knew its place, saving Qin Sang some trouble. With a lack of capable hands around, such a highly intelligent demon beast was hard to come by and could be useful.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, "Tell me, where is this place?"</p><p>What he urgently wanted to know was how the cultivators of this realm stabilized their spiritual energy and what cultivation methods they practiced. However, he needed to understand the general layout of this realm first to make any judgments.</p><p>The wolf demon hesitated, cautiously glancing at Qin Sang.</p><p>This person's aura was obscure, and it couldn't sense his cultivation level at all. But it was certain that he far surpassed its own peak strength.</p><p>Just a hint of the pressure emanating from him was enough to make its heart race.</p><p>A Taoist master, under the rule of the Taoist Court, could he really be lost?</p><p>Uncertain of what Qin Sang wanted to ask, the wolf demon racked its brains and began to recount everything it knew.</p><p>Qin Sang listened quietly and learned that this was a realm dominated by Taoism.</p><p>The Nine Dragons Kingdom, where he currently was, was under the jurisdiction of a Taoist sub-altar. The king and the nobility were all mortals, and the Taoist sects rarely interfered with the rise and fall of mortal dynasties, a strategy similar to that of the Storm Realm's cultivation sects in governing the mortal world.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had heard the female Taoist priest announce her title and knew that the Nine Dragons Kingdom was under the jurisdiction of the Ninth Sub-Altar of the Mystic Response True Altar.</p><p>However, according to the wolf demon, the full name of this region was: Central Prosperity Governance, Clear Void Tranquility, Mystic Response True Altar, Ninth Sub-Altar, Nine Dragons Kingdom, Floating Dragon City.</p><p>There were legends of the Nine Heavens Golden Palace, but they remained just that—legends. No one knew if it truly existed or where it might be.</p><p>The altars were divided into main altars and sub-altars.</p><p>Tranquility referred to Tranquility Huts, also known as Tranquility Altars.</p><p>Each Tranquility Altar had various departments managing humans, gods, ghosts, and demons, much like a mortal dynasty, with a hierarchy of official ranks divided into nine grades, with the first grade being the highest. Each grade had principal and secondary distinctions.</p><p>The sub-altar master, like the female Taoist priest, held the official rank of Principal Sixth Grade, serving as the Chief Law Officer of the Celestial Pivot Court, concurrently managing Celestial Pivot Court affairs.</p><p>Below the sixth grade, all served in various sub-altars. The national preceptors of each kingdom held positions in the Celestial Pivot Court, acting as overseers of their regions.</p><p>The main altar master was titled Supreme Clear Mystic Capital Grand Master, holding the rank of Secondary Fifth Grade. Only the most important main altars could be elevated by half a grade.</p><p>Above them were the Tranquility Hut Chief Officers, known as the Nine Heavens Golden Palace Censors, holding the rank of Principal Fourth Grade, managing Celestial Pivot Court affairs.</p><p>Beyond that was the Central Prosperity Governance, which the wolf demon knew little about.</p><p>The hierarchy was clear and strict, hence it was also referred to as the Taoist Court, but the Taoist Court was not limited to the Celestial Pivot Court.</p><p>The Central Prosperity Governance was under the jurisdiction of the Celestial Pivot Court, while the White Stone Governance was under the North Pole Exorcism Court, both collectively known as the Two Governances. It was said that the North Pole Exorcism Court could rival the Celestial Pivot Court in power and rank, though their official titles differed.</p><p>However, within the Central Prosperity Governance, the Taoist Court usually referred to the Celestial Pivot Court.</p><p>Of course, not all Taoist cultivators in the Central Prosperity Governance were affiliated with the Celestial Pivot Court. There were many Taoist sects outside the Celestial Pivot Court, but they couldn't truly live as free as clouds and wild cranes. As long as they were under the jurisdiction of the Taoist Court, they were subject to its laws and regulations, adhering to the Heavenly Laws. Any misconduct would be punished by the Taoist Court.</p><p>For example, the wolf demon's former master hailed from the Danxiao Mansion, whose mountain gate was located in the Tranquility of True Perfection within the Central Prosperity Governance. Even the main altar master of the Tranquility of True Perfection would have to open the mountain gate to welcome them, showing great respect.</p><p>These Taoist sect cultivators, after being assessed for their merits and demerits, could also become celestial officials in the Celestial Pivot Court, though they were a minority.</p><p>The wolf demon's former master, having achieved the Ascendant Mystic Law Rank, chose not to join the Taoist Court.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel surprised. A Nascent Soul cultivator in the Celestial Pivot Court could only hold the rank of a Fifth Grade Main Altar Master, with Tranquility Huts and Central Prosperity Governance above them. If the official ranks corresponded to cultivation levels, did this realm have Void Refinement cultivators or even higher?</p><p>"How many levels of Law Ranks do Taoist cultivators have?" Qin Sang asked solemnly.</p><p>The wolf demon was momentarily stunned, unsure how to answer.</p><p>In this realm, all human cultivators joined the Taoist sects, and the Taoist cultivation hierarchy was common knowledge, even known to the demon and ghost kingdoms in the Eastern Twin Mountains.</p><p>Seeing that this person was clear-headed and his aura was profound and balanced, he must have received proper teachings. How could he not know the Taoist cultivation methods?</p><p>"Could he be a demon from beyond the realm?"</p><p>The wolf demon suddenly recalled a legend and shivered, not daring to speculate further. It quickly shared what it knew.</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel relieved that he had been cautious.</p><p>The overall strength of the Taoist cultivators in this realm was indeed much higher than that of the Storm Realm, with no fear of a dead end in cultivation.</p><p>The Taoist cultivation hierarchy in this realm was called Law Ranks, divided into nine levels, from highest to lowest: Completion of the Dao Law Rank, Cave of Truth Law Rank, River Chart Law Rank, Five Talismans Law Rank, Cave of Mystery Law Rank, Ascendant Mystic Law Rank, Cave of Divinity Law Rank, Virtue of the Dao Law Rank, and Orthodox Unity Law Rank.</p><p>The levels he was familiar with—Great Ascendant, Unity, Void Refinement, Nascent Soul, Golden Core, Foundation Establishment, and Qi Refinement—were eight in total.</p><p>Due to its limited cultivation and knowledge, the wolf demon didn't know much about the higher Law Ranks.</p><p>But Qin Sang could confirm from its description that, at least below the Nascent Soul level, the cultivation strength corresponded.</p><p>For example, the female Taoist priest was at the Cave of Divinity Law Rank, her aura comparable to a Golden Core cultivator, while the middle-aged Taoist priest from the main altar must be at the Ascendant Mystic Law Rank, equivalent to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>The wolf demon had once overheard its former master and his close aides discussing a Cave of Mystery Law Rank master, and from its retelling, it seemed comparable to a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>Based on this, Great Ascendant cultivators were only at the Cave of Truth Law Rank, but it was unclear whether there were further divisions within the Great Ascendant level or something beyond it.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang was still far from such realms, and now was not the time to ponder these matters.</p><p>"Do the Law Ranks correspond to the official ranks?" Qin Sang calculated that the Celestial Pivot Court's official ranks were divided into nine grades, which could correspond to the nine Law Ranks.</p><p>If so, did that mean the First Grade celestial officials of the Celestial Pivot Court were all Great Ascendant cultivators?</p><p>If that were the case, Great Ascendant cultivators likely wouldn't remain in a minor realm. He must have ascended to a major realm.</p><p>The wolf demon, now accustomed to Qin Sang's questions, treated him as a demon from beyond the realm and answered truthfully, "The Eighth and Ninth Grades are held by Orthodox Unity Law Rank cultivators. Starting from the Seventh Grade, it should be so. This humble demon didn't follow its former master for long, but from what I've seen, there might be cases where someone's Law Rank has advanced but their official rank hasn't been promoted due to special circumstances. However, I've never seen someone promoted to a high rank without the corresponding cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. The Completion of the Dao Law Rank was indeed mysterious. "So, the Central Prosperity Governance's Chief Officer must be at least at the Five Talismans Law Rank."</p><p>The Chief Officer was the head of the Central Prosperity Governance, holding the Central Prosperity Governance Chief Officer Seal.</p><p>And the Five Talismans Law Rank was likely equivalent to a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>The wolf demon smiled ingratiatingly, "This humble demon has limited knowledge, but I've heard that the Celestial Pivot Court of the Central Prosperity Governance indeed has Grand Masters, though I don't know if they are the Chief Officers."</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly scoffed.</p><p>He had already learned that in this realm, Taoist cultivators who reached the Ascendant Mystic Law Rank, equivalent to Nascent Soul cultivators, could be called Masters, consistent with the Storm Realm.</p><p>However, the three Law Ranks above Ascendant Mystic were all called Masters, up to the River Chart Law Rank, which he inferred to be equivalent to Unity cultivators, who could be honored as Grand Masters. Since the Five Talismans Law Rank Masters oversaw the governance of a region, they were commonly referred to as Grand Masters.</p><p>He, a mere Void Refinement cultivator, had been honored as a Grand Master for many years, which now made him feel somewhat embarrassed.</p><p>If the high-ranking Taoist masters of this realm found out, they would surely rebuke him for overstepping.</p><p>Having grasped the general outline of the Taoist sects, Qin Sang then inquired about the cultivation methods practiced by the Taoists of this realm.</p><p>The answer surprised him greatly.</p><p>Based on what he had seen and heard, he had assumed that this realm practiced both divine and talisman paths. However, it turned out that the Taoists here cultivated talismans and meditation.</p><p>Talismans and meditation were to be considered separately.</p><p>The key lay in 'meditation'!</p><p>Meditation, also known as Dharma Meditation, was said by the Taoists to possess immense power.</p><p>It could command the deities of heaven and earth, summon ghosts and spirits, judge sins and blessings, assess merits and demerits, and issue decrees to all spirits.</p><p>It could also slay demons and subdue monsters, control mountains and rivers.</p><p>It could purify foul energies and command all forms of qi.</p><p>It could also merge with the Dao, allowing one to cultivate and ascend to immortality!</p><p>What Qin Sang had previously seen as 'meditation' was the Proclamation to All Spirits Seal in the female Taoist priest's altar and the Danxiao Banner in the wolf soldier's altar.</p><p>These were the true forms of Dharma Meditation, also known as Meditation Seals, with different seals passed down through different lineages.</p><p>The Proclamation to All Spirits Seal was unique to the Celestial Pivot Court. It was said that the celestial officials of the North Pole Exorcism Court used a seal called the Nine Heavens Soldier Talisman!</p><p>When the wolf demon was summoned as a soldier by its former master, he had already reached the Ascendant Mystic Law Rank, so it wasn't clear what the original form of meditation was. It was said to be something like a seal talisman, possibly a combination of cryptic runes or an incredibly complex talisman diagram.</p><p>As one's cultivation advanced, a true Meditation Seal would gradually form.</p><p>Taoist disciples, after being initiated into the sect, needed to receive meditation. Only after receiving meditation could they begin cultivation. This involved two important functions of meditation.</p><p>First, it could purify foul energies and stabilize the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi.</p><p>Second, it could facilitate the meditation on divine truths.</p><p>"Six Heavens' Ancient Qi..."</p><p>Qin Sang silently repeated this term.</p><p>The Taoists of this realm viewed chaotic energies as the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi. After receiving meditation, with the altar as the foundation, one could use the altar to stabilize the heavens and fix the primordial qi, allowing one to enter the path of cultivation.</p><p>However, merely stabilizing the primordial qi was not enough. The Six Heavens' Ancient Qi contained chaotic mechanisms that, over time, would erode the cultivator's soul, affect their mind, and shake their foundation. Thus, one needed to use meditation techniques to visualize heavenly deities, using the seal as a medium, to harmonize with the divine spirits and sense the heavenly will. This ensured safety.</p><p>This method was also known as Divine Meditation, and the visualized deities were called Guardian Deities or Altar Guardian Generals. The Meditation Seal and the Altar Guardian Generals were the pillars of the altar.</p><p>Dharma Meditation not only protected the Taoist priest but also allowed the soldiers under their command to cultivate around the altar, receiving protection. They could also meditate on the Guardian Deities alongside the priest, not only strengthening the altar but also benefiting the priest's cultivation through their sincere devotion. It was a mutually beneficial relationship.</p><p>The altar could not only be used for cultivation but also for storing soldiers. When a Taoist priest traveled, they could take their soldiers with them by storing the altar.</p><p>If one encountered a Taoist priest and thought they were alone and vulnerable, they would be gravely mistaken. The priest could instantly summon thousands of demon soldiers, with banners blotting out the sky, truly embodying the phrase "one person is an army."</p><p>However, maintaining an army was not easy, and there was the risk of the altar exploding.</p><p>Because the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi ran rampant in this realm, demon cultivators who practiced alone faced an increasing risk of losing their sanity as their cultivation advanced. Even demon cultivators with low intelligence could sense the benefits of the altar, making it easier to recruit soldiers compared to other realms.</p><p>Moreover, the Meditation Seal had the ability to enlighten spirits. Without the need for the Emperor's Nectar, the generals and soldiers in the army, once enlightened by the Taoist priest, would be grateful and more willing to submit.</p><p>Naturally, there were limits to the number and cultivation level of the soldiers, but the wolf demon wasn't entirely clear on this, only knowing that it was related to the priest's cultivation level and the Meditation Seal they had received.</p><p>Receiving meditation was not a one-time event. Upon achieving certain merits, one needed to receive higher-level Meditation Seals, which was part of the Taoist cultivation hierarchy.</p><p>Receiving meditation had to be done at the altar. Each sect had its own mountain gate and sect altar, and the Celestial Pivot Court also had its own altars. The so-called Governances, Tranquility Huts, Main Altars, and Sub-Altars all had the responsibility of conferring meditation.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's initially relaxed mood grew heavier.</p><p>"Are you the rebellious soldier who caused the altar to explode?" Qin Sang scrutinized the wolf demon.</p><p>The wolf demon shrank back. It hadn't wanted to reveal its shameful past, but considering that its identity as a wandering master had already been exposed on the river, this person could easily find out with a simple inquiry, so it dared not hide the truth.</p><p>"That old Taoist was cruel and harsh. This humble demon was forcibly conscripted later and wasn't one of his close soldiers. I was often mistreated. That old Taoist favored his own and frequently unjustly punished me..."</p><p>The wolf demon wanted to argue further, but under Qin Sang's amused gaze, even its sharp tongue faltered.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bother with its excuses and asked indifferently, "Tell me, you mentioned that Taoist priests receive meditation and meditate on divine spirits, allowing them to summon heavenly soldiers and generals. Have you ever seen this?"</p><p>The wolf demon breathed a sigh of relief and quickly shook its head, "I haven't. That old Taoist always used his own soldiers in battles. Since he wasn't a celestial official of the Celestial Pivot Court, he had no authority to command. To summon city gods or mountain deities, he had to promise benefits first. There were no heavenly soldiers or generals. It must be something the Taoist sects boast about."</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in acknowledgment and asked, "If there are no heavenly deities, where do the city gods and mountain deities come from?"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>The wolf demon was stumped. It had never really thought about this question.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, the wolf demon suddenly remembered something and exclaimed, "This humble demon recalls! That old Taoist once said—'All gods are appointed by humans!'"</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Thank you to Chain Sin Wheel for the generous reward. I almost forgot to acknowledge it as I haven't been checking the Author's Assistant recently. My apologies.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
