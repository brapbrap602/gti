<h1>Chapter Two Thousand and Thirteen: The Sage</h1><p>Qin Sang had envisioned various reunion scenarios, even imagining encountering seniors who had ascended from the Storm Realm long ago.  Yet he never expected that his first 'reunion' would be with a spirit embryo he had personally refined.</p><p>Back then, when the Void Spirit Sect discovered Fire Jade within the Mountain within a Mountain and cultivated a special fire spirit, Sect Master Bing Han invited him and Xiang Qing of the Azure Yang Sect to assist in refining it into a spirit treasure embryo, hoping that it would one day birth a true spirit treasure for the Void Spirit Sect.</p><p>This spirit embryo had unexpectedly appeared in the Great Thousand World, and was already a pseudo-spirit treasure on the verge of transformation.</p><p>Could this woman be a Void Spirit Sect disciple who had ascended from the lower realm?</p><p>He had left the Storm Realm for less than a thousand years, and someone had already ascended to the Great Thousand World.  Did this mean that not only was the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound gone, but the path of ascension through the Return Ruins had also been restored?</p><p>Liu Li, Green Goat Temple... could someone from there have already ascended to the Great Thousand World?</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Her jade knife snatched away, the woman hadn't yet recovered from her shock when two gusts of sinister wind suddenly struck from behind, two streaks of grayish-blue light aimed directly at her back.</p><p>The blue light was an ice arrow, thinner than the one shattered by the jade knife earlier, but its glow was purer and sharper, clearly possessing greater power. Along with the incoming ice arrow came a blizzard that filled the sky.</p><p>Snowflakes as large as bushels fell with a *plop plop*, a cold wave surged, and even the wind and sand were frozen, as if all things in heaven and earth were solidified.</p><p>The gray light was a pill, the size of a dragon's eye, surrounded by gray qi, giving off a sinister aura.</p><p>The moment the pill approached the woman, a rumble suddenly erupted from the earth. Sand dunes collapsed, the desert cracked, and a plume of gray qi burst from the ground, soaring into the sky.</p><p>Within the gray qi was a terrifying phantom, a giant gray-scaled python.  Its body was as massive as a mountain, its dull gray scales seemingly composed of earth and stone.  It swallowed the pill in one gulp, erupting with monstrous ferocity, its long tail suddenly coiling.</p><p>The earth seemed to transform into a blanket, vibrating rhythmically.  The yellow sand was lifted by a powerful force, forming a terrifying dust storm that threatened to engulf the woman.</p><p>Ice and snow above, dust storm below, the ice arrow and the gray-scaled python arrived in an instant, leaving no escape route between heaven and earth.</p><p>Under such a tight offensive, even if the woman hadn't been distracted, escaping would be no easy feat.</p><p>At this moment, the woman had no time to care about Qin Sang's question.  The survival instinct suppressed her fear.  She lunged forward, her palace attire, which was a magical garment, hastily transforming into a cloud banner, emitting colorful mist.  Clouds and rosy hues instantly enveloped her, forming a protective aura.</p><p>But this was far from enough to extricate her from danger.  Just then, she suddenly felt the surrounding spiritual energy fluctuate.</p><p>In an instant, all sounds ceased, and the threat behind her disappeared simultaneously.</p><p>The void transformed into a magnificent yet tranquil painting, as if time itself had frozen.</p><p>The ice and snow, the dust storm, the colorful mist, everything froze at this moment. The ice arrow and the gray-scaled python were also restrained by an invisible force, unable to move.</p><p>The two pursuers felt their scalps tingle as a chill colder than the blizzard permeated their bodies.  In their terror, they were about to retreat when they felt a terrifying pressure descend.</p><p>The black-robed man who had wielded the ice arrow spat out an oval-shaped piece of profound ice. Its surface was inscribed with dense runes, a protective treasure.  However, the profound ice merely flickered with blue light before extinguishing.</p><p>Then, the black-robed man involuntarily flew towards Qin Sang.</p><p>His companion reacted slightly faster, summoning a jade bracelet that manifested a ring of protective light around him.  But that was all it could do. The jade bracelet couldn't protect him at all, and he was carried away along with the other man.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The two crashed heavily to the ground, unable to utter a word. From beginning to end, Qin Sang hadn't even glanced at them.</p><p>“You don't need to come over.”</p><p>Qin Sang said in a deep voice.</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>Qu Zhen's voice came from the wind and sand in the distance. The members of the Constant Sand Society, without asking why, immediately retreated to their chariot.</p><p>Two powerful enemies captured in an instant, at his mercy.  The woman, still shaken, stared blankly at Qin Sang. Suddenly, she remembered Qin Sang's earlier question and finally realized something.</p><p>“Do you know my Master?”</p><p>At this moment, the woman seemed to have just clearly seen Qin Sang's face.  Her eyes widened, her lips parted slightly in disbelief, and she blurted out,</p><p>“You… You are Sage Qin!”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the woman's change in expression. She seemed to be Bing Han’s disciple and recognized him. However, her words were unexpected, causing him to frown.</p><p>Sage? What sage? When was he canonized, and who canonized him?</p><p>The woman, oblivious to Qin Sang’s confusion, continued with an expression of reverence, her voice filled with excitement and delight, “Junior Gu Ya, pays respects to the Sage!  The Sage once lectured at my sect. I was young then and unfortunately missed the opportunity, a regret I’ve always carried.  Later, I visited the sacred grounds to pay my respects to the sacred statue and make a wish.  I never imagined I would have such great fortune to meet the Sage in person and be saved by him…”</p><p>Sacred statue? Sacred grounds? What nonsense!</p><p>Qin Sang was completely bewildered, finding it all absurd. He waved his hand to stop Gu Ya, “What sage? I know nothing about it.  Who erected a statue of me? And where are these sacred grounds?”</p><p>Gu Ya froze, realizing she was too excited and hadn’t explained things clearly. After the upheaval, the Sage hadn’t returned, so he must be unaware of what transpired.</p><p>“Back then, the Sage caused a celestial phenomenon in the Boundless Sea, visible throughout the realm. Later, the truth came to light. We learned that the Sage had offered himself to the demon, drawing it away and saving the lives of an entire realm. He also shattered the cage imprisoning the realm, allowing it to ascend into the Great Thousand World, paving a path for future generations.  We thought the Sage had…”</p><p>Gu Ya paused, “To express our gratitude for the Sage’s grace, we venerate the Green Goat Temple as sacred ground.  Fairy Liu Li, along with the major sects, erected a statue of the Sage at the sacred grounds, for all eternity to admire!”</p><p>“What did you say? The entire Storm Realm ascended to the Great Thousand World?” Qin Sang keenly grasped the most crucial information, startled. “When?”</p><p>The Talisman Realm ascended as a whole, and now the Storm Realm had also ascended.</p><p>Could this be why the First Sword Attendant could no longer sense the Storm Realm?</p><p>But the Talisman Realm was one of the Four Separate Domains created by the Dao Court in ancient times, formed by the Dao Court leveraging the power of the Divine Court to separate it from the Great Thousand World, becoming a realm of its own.</p><p>What about the Storm Realm?</p><p>What was the Storm Realm's origin?</p><p>Did the Storm Realm’s ascension to the Great Thousand World have anything to do with the Dao Court's return, or was it related to the Purple Subtlety Palace?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but look westward.  The Storm Realm's existence might have been solely to contain and conceal the Purple Subtlety Palace.  With the palace recalled, the cage of the Storm Realm was broken. However, according to Ghost Mother and various indications, before the Purple Subtlety Palace, the Storm Realm clearly held greater secrets, secrets even the First Sword Attendant dared not forcefully pry into.</p><p>If the Storm Realm was also a part of the Great Thousand World, why did cultivators ascending from the Storm Realm still experience the Gray Heavenly Tribulation? Only in Minor Thousand Worlds, where the Heavenly Dao was incomplete, would cultivators comprehend the true Heavenly Dao amidst the tribulation lightning upon ascending to the Great Thousand World.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure if there were any precedents of a Minor Thousand World completely merging into the Great Thousand World.</p><p>This news was entirely unexpected, leaving Qin Sang's mind in a whirl, flooded with countless questions.</p><p>“I can’t say the exact time!</p><p>“It is said that one day, mist suddenly appeared in the Storm Belt, but no one could say when it first emerged.  The mist first spread within the Storm Belt, then filled the entire area, making the barrier appear as a vast expanse of white.</p><p>“Gradually, the invisible barrier that held back the storms seemed unable to withstand the encroaching mist. People grew uneasy.</p><p>“Later, the barrier's power truly began to wane. The white mist crossed the barrier, enveloping the land and sea, omnipresent. Heaven and earth were shrouded in a boundless expanse of white, and people were terrified, believing the end of the world was at hand.  </p><p>“Then came the fluctuating spiritual energy.  Spiritual tides roared incessantly in the sky, as if the heavens were collapsing, as if the storms were truly invading.  All living beings were consumed by fear, frantically searching for refuge. Cultivators could only hide in their caves, the major sects powerless, sealing their mountain gates and awaiting the apocalypse.</p><p>“But as time went on, we discovered that not only did the end of the world not arrive, but the spiritual energy grew richer amidst the fluctuations. Some broke through bottlenecks that had long held them back, as if a depleted world was being revived.</p><p>“Finally, someone ventured out and discovered that the invisible barrier had vanished, but the eternal storms had also dissipated…”</p><p>Gu Ya described the changes during the Storm Realm's merging with the Great Thousand World, all from her personal experience.</p><p>According to Gu Ya, the truth was concealed by the mist, and no one could say for certain when the Storm Realm truly merged.</p><p>When they first entered the Great Thousand World, the cultivators of the Storm Realm were still bewildered, unsure of what had happened. They only knew that the Storm Realm's spiritual energy was becoming increasingly rich, more and more suitable for cultivation.</p><p>It wasn't until much later that they understood what had transpired.</p><p>All the changes occurred gradually, without a definitive point in time.  The abundant spiritual energy didn't surge into the Storm Realm in a single instant.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully questioned Gu Ya about her experiences during that period, trying to find some evidence to support his judgment.</p><p>After leaving the Storm Realm, he had traveled from the Central Continent to the Boundless Sea and even glanced at the edge of the Return Ruins.  Earlier still, he and Liu Li had traveled from the North Sea to the Central Continent.</p><p>But Qin Sang couldn't be certain whether the 'mist' Gu Ya mentioned had begun to gather at that time.  Within the Storm Belt, the ceaseless storms ravaged the sea, perpetually shrouded in water mist, while between the Western Lands and the Central Continent lay raging flames.</p><p>The changes the Storm Realm experienced lasted for a long time.  The mist was already spreading when he was in the Talisman Realm.  It wasn't until he ascended to the Great Thousand World that the cultivators of the Storm Realm confirmed their merging.</p><p>It was impossible to determine whether this had any connection to the Dao Court's return, or whether it was caused by the earlier ascension of the Purple Subtlety Palace.</p><p>Ironically, Qin Sang had gone through numerous trials and tribulations to ascend to the Great Thousand World, while the beings of the Storm Realm had 'ascended' in a daze.</p><p>How would Sage Hui Guang, Saint King Qing Hu, and Mo Xing Dao feel about this?  How would the Storm Realm seniors who had painstakingly opened the path of ascension through the Return Ruins feel?  How would the geniuses who had died with regret, blocked at the gates of Nascent Soul, feel?</p><p>Qin Sang had initially thought it unlikely he would ever see his old friends from the Storm Realm again, perhaps only two or three managing to ascend.</p><p>But now, with the Storm Realm merging with the Great Thousand World, its spiritual energy revived, transformed into a cultivation paradise, and aided by the Gray Heavenly Tribulation, many of his old friends would surely experience a surge in cultivation!</p><p>“Where is the Storm Realm now? How did you end up here, being chased?”</p><p>Qin Sang suspected the Storm Realm might be near the Abundant Despair Jade Gate.  If so, could it be due to the Purple Subtlety Palace?</p><p>“After merging with the Great Thousand World, the mist didn’t dissipate.  Whether on land or sea, day or night, it remained misty, the fog perpetually lingering. Later, we learned that we had landed in a place called the Sea of Mist.</p><p>“The Sea of Mist is far from peaceful. Just as we were exploring outwards, we were discovered by a foreign race, the Zhangyou Clan, which quickly led to war.</p><p>“The Zhangyou Clan, like humans, have two arms and two legs, but are covered in yellow fur, more abundant than ours, resembling apes but with four ears. They possess innate water manipulation abilities and are as comfortable in the sea as fish.  Caught off guard, we suffered heavy losses. My Master also perished in that war.”</p><p>Gu Ya’s voice lowered, the excitement she felt upon seeing Qin Sang diminishing considerably. The Storm Realm had merged with the Great Thousand World, and cultivators saw the dawn of the Immortal Dao, yet her Master had fallen at the very moment of its arrival. How could this not be heartbreaking?</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  His friendship with Bing Han had begun with this jade knife, and now, upon hearing the news, he learned of her passing.  And she was certainly not the only one lost.</p><p>“Later, we discovered that we hadn't entered human territory, but the domain of the Otherkin.  The Otherkin have strange appearances, born with human bodies but possessing features similar to certain妖兽.  Besides the Zhangyou Clan, there are countless other Otherkin tribes with different characteristics, forming clans and kingdoms, scattered throughout the Sea of Mist.  It is said that the most powerful are the Feathered People and the Merfolk…”  Gu Ya suppressed her grief and continued.</p><p>The Sea of Mist, the Otherkin.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression turned serious. He had read related records. The Otherkin were another race in the Great Thousand World, distinct from humans,妖兽, and witches.  It was said that deep within the Eastern Sea lay a region shrouded in boundless mist, mysterious and unpredictable, where the Otherkin resided.</p><p>The Storm Realm had actually landed in Otherkin territory.  It was truly hard to say whether this was a blessing or a curse.</p><p>“Fairy Liu Li and the major sects, along with the cultivators of the Storm Realm, joined forces to resist the Otherkin. But we didn’t expect that the dangers of the Sea of Mist weren't limited to the Otherkin.  There were also natural disasters like the Mistfalls.  It was a Mistfall that swept me away to this place.”</p><p>Gu Ya recalled her experience, still shuddering at the memory. She composed herself before continuing.</p><p>“The Mistfall arrived in an instant, incredibly terrifying. I was caught completely unprepared, thinking I would be torn to shreds. After a dizzying spin, I lost consciousness.  When I awoke, I found myself seriously injured, flung onto an unfamiliar landmass. After careful inquiries, I learned I was far from the Sea of Mist, surrounded by dangers.  Alone, I could only be cautious, prioritizing the improvement of my cultivation.</p><p>“Later, I confirmed I had been thrown into the dark zone between the Savage Wilds and the Great Zhou Dynasty. By chance, I heard about the Abundant Despair Jade Gate, and that the Purple Subtlety Palace had manifested there.</p><p>“The Purple Subtlety Palace is well-known in the North Star Realm. I thought that once news of the Purple Subtlety Palace spread, seniors who had ascended from the lower realms might be drawn here as well…”</p>
