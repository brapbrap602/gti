<h1>Chapter 177: Golden Core Disciples</h1><p>Chapter 177: Golden Core Disciples</p><p>The golden light from the restriction spell formed a wall, sealing the forbidden zone.</p><p>'Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Under the impact of the Earth煞 Qi, the restriction spell shook violently, and there were loud noises.</p><p>However, by the time the Earth煞 Qi reached here it was already at its weakest, and its power soon weakened significantly.</p><p>Seeing that the Earth煞 Qi outside was starting to recede, Yu Daiyue was overjoyed. Then he thought of something and turned his head to instruct Qin Sang, "Junior Brother Qin, after the煞 Qi subsides, you and I will search the cave separately. Junior Brother Li is Windcry Uncle-Master's personal disciple and has a protective dharma artifact bestowed upon him by Windcry Uncle-Master. As long as he didn't fall into the subterranean cave, he might have a chance to survive. It's best if we can rescue him. Otherwise, I'm afraid it would be difficult to explain to Windcry Uncle-Master."</p><p>Qin Sang had been planning to find an opportunity to throw Wu Yuesheng's remains into the subterranean cave, so he agreed immediately and asked another question, "Fellow Daoist Baiyun is a casual cultivator, so it's hard to say. I remember that Senior Brother Wu was the disciple of Uncle-Master Che Yutao. In that case, Senior Brother Wu should also have a chance to survive, right?"</p><p>"Difficult!"</p><p>Yu Daiyue shook his head, his tone tinged with resentment. "Junior Brother Qin doesn't know this, but Golden Core cultivators are desperate to enter the Nascent Soul realm and must focus their mind on their Path. They are no different from us. How many of them are willing to take the time to accept disciples?</p><p>Our Shaohua Mountain, in order to prevent a lack of successors, forcefully orders its Golden Core cultivators to accept a sufficient number of disciples to guide their cultivation. For this reason, although there are many who join the sects of Golden Core cultivators, they are also divided into three, six, and nine ranks. Only a few who are truly gifted receive重視.</p><p>Junior Brother Wu is not comparable to Junior Brother Li. Junior Brother Li is exceptionally gifted, and Windcry Uncle-Master values him greatly. That's why he was able to bestow a dharma artifact on him just after breaking through to the Establishment realm. It is said that the cultivation technique that Junior Brother Li cultivates was also chosen for him by Windcry Uncle-Master. That is what a true personal disciple is.</p><p>As for someone like me, I only met my master once on the day I became his disciple. He gave me a few pointers, and I was on my own after that. My master might not even remember that he has such a disciple, unless I can break through to the later stage of the Establishment realm and gain my master's approval.</p><p>Fortunately, we have the sect to rely on, which is better than being an outside casual cultivator. But even so, I've been stuck in the early stage of the Establishment realm for decades with no hope of breaking through. Otherwise, why would I have gone to Red Dust Gourd?</p><p>Junior Brother Wu is even more miserable. It is said that on the day he became a disciple, Uncle-Master Che sensed something and needed to go into seclusion to comprehend it. He didn't even let him enter his cave dwelling and drove him out. How could he possibly have bestowed a dharma artifact on him?"</p><p>In the cultivation world, regardless of whether they were righteous or demonic, great importance was attached to the master-disciple relationship. Once one became a disciple under a master, it was not the same as the nominal superior-subordinate relationship within the sect.</p><p>Before becoming a disciple, listening to the Dao at Daomen Peak was a fair trade, where one exchanged spirit stones earned from doing chores for the sect.</p><p>However, a master had the grace of imparting the Dao, teaching, and dispelling doubts for his disciples. Their relationship was even closer than that of Dao companions. It was natural for masters to value their disciples, and for disciples to respect their masters.</p><p>This relationship could not be changed even if the heavens and the earth turned upside down.</p><p>In the future, even if a disciple's cultivation surpassed that of his master, he would still have to be respectful and courteous when he met his master. He could not show the slightest disrespect, or he would be despised by everyone in the world.</p><p>Other than Senior Brother Wen, Qin Sang had not had much contact with other Establishment realm cultivators, and it was not appropriate to ask about such private matters. Hearing Yu Daiyue say this, Qin Sang realized that there was more to it than he knew, and the last bit of regret he had disappeared.</p><p>With his terrible talent, even if he hadn't gone through this furnace cauldron incident and had managed to become a disciple of a Golden Core cultivator, he would not have been valued. It would have been the same as now. It would be better to be free and unrestrained.</p><p>Qin Sang had been worried that Wu Yuesheng had a dharma artifact bestowed upon him by Uncle-Master Che, and that there might be a secret mark left by Uncle-Master Che on it. Since he didn't know which item it was, he had decided to throw them all away.</p><p>Since none of those artifacts were bestowed upon him by Uncle-Master Che, and Wu Yuesheng was not favored by anyone and Uncle-Master Che didn't care about his life or death, it wouldn't matter if he kept them. There would be no Golden Core cultivator investigating it personally.</p><p>Crimsonflame Sword was Wu Yuesheng's lifebound spiritual sword, and it carried his aura. It would be difficult to completely erase it in a short period of time. It would be enough to destroy Crimsonflame Sword and some related items.</p><p>After waiting for a while longer, the rumbling sounds outside gradually faded away, and the golden light of the restriction spell stopped fluctuating.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yu Daiyue looked at each other, and together they manipulated the formation artifact to open the restriction spell. They saw that the great hall ahead was filled with Earth煞 Qi that had yet to disperse. The Qi was extremely cold.</p><p>However, such a small amount of Earth煞 Qi posed no threat to them. The two of them immediately split up and acted according to their agreement.</p><p>Qin Sang ran straight to the outside of the solution cave, speeding up all the way. When he was about to reach the cave entrance, he cast the Falling Cloud Wings to conceal himself.</p><p>Upon returning to the lair, he saw that the soaring Earth Fiend's breath had already subsided. The overcast barrier in the sky had actually been directly ruptured into a huge gap, and even a large round hole appeared on the mountain cliff where it overlapped above, revealing the blue sky.</p><p>It was noon at this moment, with the sun high in the sky and sunlight shining into the lair, creating a rather peculiar scene.</p><p>Even the scorching sun could not dispel the heart-piercing cold. Deep in the lair, dark energy surged as if a black dragon were rolling about inside, giving off an extremely terrifying aura.</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously shielded himself as he approached the Earth Fiend's breath and discreetly tossed in items such as the Scarlet Flame Sword. He watched as the Earth Fiend's breath swallowed them whole, then returned to the solution cave and patiently began searching.</p><p>Ultimately, the duo reunited in the sky above the lair. They had meticulously searched every nook and cranny of the Ghost Corpse Sect's sub-sect but had not found Li Zai. They hadn't even discovered any of his remains, so it was highly likely that Li Zai had failed to escape into the solution cave and had been devoured by the Earth Fiend's breath.</p><p>Yu Daiyue gave a wry smile. "Junior Brother Qin, we must come up with a good excuse before reporting back to the sect. If Reverend Windbell were to fly into a rage, even if your elder brother survives, he'll be skinned alive."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Three fellow disciples had died on this trip, and the sect would definitely not turn a blind eye. Fortunately, it was not his idea to come here, and thus Yu Daiyue was under far more pressure than he was.</p><p>The overcast barrier was gradually recovering. The duo hurriedly got on their swords and flew out of the lair. When they saw the scene around the mountain peaks, they couldn't help but be horrified. Affected by the Earth Fiend's breath, the surrounding vegetation had wilted, and all life had been extinguished, leaving the earth pitch black like a graveyard.</p><p>Such a huge commotion might very well attract the attention of ill-intentioned parties. Not daring to tarry, the duo identified the direction of the sect and sped away.</p><p>Flying on swords was far faster than riding flying magic treasures. They almost reached Mount Shao Hua within a month. Qin Sang used an excuse to part ways with Yu Daiyue and hid certain dubious objects. Not long after arriving at Dragon Back Temple, he saw an elder clad in moon-white Daoist robes gracefully arriving.</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Brother Chu."</p><p>Qin Sang recognized this Senior Brother Chu, the chief of the Law Enforcement Hall. It seemed Yu Daiyue had already reported the incident.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin."</p><p>Senior Brother Chu's tone was neither sharp nor harsh. "You must know why this old man has come. If there are no urgent matters, please return to the sect with me. I've heard that Junior Sister Qingting entrusted her final affairs to you?"</p>
