<h1>Chapter 352: Immortal Master Han</h1><p>Hidden Mountain Market.</p><p>Deep mountains and secluded valleys, dense forests and light mist.</p><p>Just as in my memory.</p><p>It seems that Hidden Mountain Market hasn't changed much over the years.</p><p>Qin Sang descended from the clouds, wearing a cloak. Standing at the market entrance, he recalled his past journey seeking immortality, a sense of life's changes washing over him. Then, he gave a carefree laugh.</p><p>At this moment, the mist stirred, and a young man, only at the third level of Qi Refining, walked out. Seeing Qin Sang, his expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly bowed, "Junior Zhang Feng greets Senior!"</p><p>"Are you the gatekeeper of Hidden Mountain Market?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the man and asked.</p><p>It wasn't the previous gatekeeper.  It made sense; that man was just a mortal, and already quite old back then. After so many years, he must have long since returned to dust.</p><p>Zhang Feng nodded repeatedly, "Senior has a keen eye! I'm here on my family's orders to welcome fellow Daoists and guests into the market. Our Hidden Mountain Market is the largest market in the entire Hidden Mountain range. If Senior wishes to purchase spirit pills, magical artifacts, or other items, I can assist you. If you have other matters, I can also report to the elders of my family to facilitate things for you."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "I'm just here to look around, and pick something up..."</p><p>The Hidden Mountain range lies at the edge of the righteous path's territory, bordering the demonic path. It's located just south and slightly east of Gloomy Mountain Pass. The area is a mix of all sorts, which is why Qin Sang had encountered all kinds of people the last time he visited the market.</p><p>For Hidden Mountain Market to stand in this environment for so many years, its owner must be quite extraordinary.</p><p>Essentially, the righteous and demonic paths of the Small Cold Region are divided by a line south from Gloomy Mountain Pass. The mountain gates of the Yuan Zhao Sect and the Kui Yin Sect are also located on either side of this line, facing each other.</p><p>Qin Sang, fearing he might run into acquaintances, had taken a large detour, avoiding the former site of the Yuan Zhao Sect, before arriving at Hidden Mountain Market. His purpose was to retrieve the letter left by Tan Hao and erase any trace of it.</p><p>That Tan Hao, even in danger, hadn't forgotten to leave a warning was one of the reasons Qin Sang was willing to help him.</p><p>He took out Tan Hao's token and handed it to Zhang Feng.</p><p>Zhang Feng didn't possess the previous gatekeeper's photographic memory and said, "Please wait a moment, Senior..."</p><p>He hurried inside.</p><p>Before long, Zhang Feng returned with a yellowed letter, walking quickly, "Reporting to Senior, there is indeed a letter that hasn't been retrieved. Please see if this is it.  This letter was left by a fellow Daoist over forty years ago. The person who left it didn't leave any information, and hasn't been seen since."</p><p>Qin Sang took the letter and unfolded it. The content was simple, it was the code left by the Tan brothers, warning him not to continue cultivating with the Yama Banner.</p><p>Crushing the letter into dust with a wave of his hand, Qin Sang nodded to Zhang Feng, "Thank you, fellow Daoist. This is the letter."</p><p>He had intended to leave directly, but a sudden impulse made him want to take a look inside. Although he hadn't stayed in Hidden Mountain Market for long, it held great significance for him. It was here that his journey into the cultivation world began.</p><p>From this place, he joined the Kui Yin Sect, experienced the Yuan Zhao Sect, Mount Shaohua, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and finally arrived at where he was now.</p><p>Zhang Feng sensed that Qin Sang didn't want to be disturbed and tactfully retreated.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang entered the market.</p><p>Streets and canals crisscrossed, shops lined the roads, willow trees provided shade, and the streets were bustling with people, mostly mortals.</p><p>Some places matched his memory, but much had changed.</p><p>These mortals were already accustomed to people wearing cloaks and masks, and no one came over to gawk. Qin Sang walked silently along the streets, unknowingly arriving at the blue-stone street within Hidden Mountain Market.</p><p>In the plaza surrounded by winding streams, there were still some cultivators setting up stalls to trade, but the flow of people was far less dense than before.</p><p>Most of the cultivators in the plaza were at the Qi Refining stage.  As a tribute to the past, Qin Sang strolled around the plaza, but found nothing that caught his eye, nor did he see the fat man who sold him the " Netherworld Scripture".</p><p>Right, the Divine Artifact Pavilion!</p><p>Qin Sang quickened his pace and walked to the wooden building in his memory.</p><p>The building remained, but the plaque had been changed to "Autumn Water Pavilion," selling various common spiritual materials of the cultivation world.  Business was slow, and the shopkeeper was lazily dozing in a reclining chair.</p><p>The shopkeeper of the shop next to the Divine Artifact Pavilion, with whom he had once conversed, was also gone.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it and turned to leave.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly sensed two powerful auras. He looked up towards the entrance of the blue-stone street and saw five people approaching from afar.</p><p>Surprisingly, all five were cultivators, and two of them were Foundation Establishment cultivators!</p><p>Although they weren't being arrogant, the presence of two Foundation Establishment cultivators together was still eye-catching. Pedestrians on the street gave way as they approached.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. He didn't want to provoke enemies unnecessarily and was about to step aside when he suddenly stopped, staring at the person walking at the front of the five, a look of surprise gradually appearing on his face.</p><p>This person was tall and imposing, with an extraordinary aura. His cultivation level was actually at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Judging from appearance alone, it was difficult to discern the true age of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>This person had sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, with sharp features. He looked to be less than thirty years old, but his cultivation and exceptionally calm demeanor were definitely not something a young person could possess.</p><p>This person seemed to be the highest-ranking of the five.</p><p>The other three, including the old man with the subtle aura, seemed more like his guards, their gazes intentionally or unintentionally sweeping across the surroundings. Their auras were like unsheathed swords, ready to respond to any sudden attack, vigilant of their surroundings.</p><p>At this person's waist hung a circular jade pendant. The warm jade pendant was engraved with the characters "Pure Yang."</p><p>In the cultivation world, only disciples of one sect were qualified to wear such a pendant.</p><p>The Pure Yang Sect, one of the eight righteous sects!</p><p>However, there was a slight difference on this person's jade pendant compared to the disciples of the Pure Yang Sect. Below the words "Pure Yang," there was a small character - Han!</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the jade pendant.</p><p>He also recognized the person.</p><p>This person was Immortal Master Han, whom he had saved at the foot of Mount Guling and who had later given him a token, directing him to Hidden Mountain Market!</p><p>Although many years had passed, Immortal Master Han hadn't changed much, and Qin Sang recognized him at a glance.</p><p>Why was he here?</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.</p><p>After obtaining the map of the Small Cold Region, Qin Sang had guessed that Immortal Master Han might be a member of the Han family, and now it seemed he was right.</p><p>The Han family was a cultivation family affiliated with the Pure Yang Sect, but their location was still south of Hidden Mountain Market, not close by, and this wasn't within the Pure Yang Sect's territory.</p><p>He bore no resentment towards Immortal Master Han.</p><p>Although the token Immortal Master Han had given him had led him astray, Immortal Master Han had made it clear beforehand that all the choices Qin Sang made were his own.</p><p>But there was one question that Qin Sang had never been able to figure out.</p><p>He hadn't had the time to deal with such trivial matters, and since it had already happened, there was no point dwelling on it and wasting precious cultivation time.</p><p>Now that he had encountered him, perhaps he could finally understand.</p>
