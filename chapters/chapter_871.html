<h1>Chapter 863: Blood Sword</h1><p>Cold air bound the Kui Dragon.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang first flew into the sky, disrupting the clouds to prevent the Kui Dragon from using the power of thunder and lightning to break the formation. Legend had it that Kui Dragons could control thunder and lightning, and no one dared to be certain what kind of terrifying electrical storm would be unleashed if the Kui Dragon used its innate powers.</p><p>Then, the young man surnamed Fang flew back to help them suppress the Kui Dragon's counterattack.</p><p>His back-and-forth efforts, combined with everyone's concerted efforts, stabilized the Cold Wind and Fierce Gale Formation. The cold air finally stabilized.</p><p>With the continuous release of energy from the crystal stele, more and more cold air gathered upwards. White mist condensed, and the pillars of cold air became thicker and heavier, looking like a cage made of black ice from afar.</p><p>However, the Kui Dragon's counterattack did not weaken in the slightest.</p><p>Its roars grew increasingly piercing, its claws flailing, and lightning bolts erupted from its mouth, violently striking the cage. Each impact brought intense tremors and dense cracks.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others, who were the main controllers of the formation, felt their blood surge and their faces turned pale, their vital essence pouring out like a flood.</p><p>However, as the cage neared completion, the damage caused by the Kui Dragon's resistance lessened.</p><p>Seeing this, the young man surnamed Fang's face lit up with joy. He stopped assisting, withdrew his golden rope, and transmitted his voice, "Keep maintaining the formation! You must not let the Kui Dragon escape!"</p><p>Then, the young man surnamed Fang brushed his hand across his waist and took out a palm-sized short sword.</p><p>It looked like a short sword, but it was actually smaller than a dagger.</p><p>Both the hilt and the blade of the short sword were a strange blood-red color, and the blood groove looked as if blood was flowing through it. As soon as it was taken out, a pungent bloody smell filled the air, and the nearby cold air was also tinged with red.</p><p>After taking out the blood sword, the young man surnamed Fang's expression became serious. He carefully held the hilt with one hand and sat cross-legged in the air.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were concentrating on controlling the spiritual formation. After the young man surnamed Fang took out the blood sword, they sensed something unusual and couldn't help but open their eyes and look over.</p><p>"What kind of evil weapon is this?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>The blood energy on this blood sword was too strong, as if it had been soaked in a pool of blood for countless years. It was definitely an extremely evil object, and it probably wasn't a righteous tool.</p><p>Even if it was refined from demon blood, who knew how many demon beasts' lives it had consumed.</p><p>Judging by the young man surnamed Fang's cautious appearance, the blood sword shouldn't be his natal magic treasure, and neither did the golden rope seem like one. This made Qin Sang a little curious.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, a natal magic treasure should be a cultivator's most powerful weapon, one that is connected to their mind.</p><p>Apart from anomalies like the Ebony Sword, which requires external objects to strengthen its origin and carry Killing Talismans, natal magic treasures can be continuously refined as one's cultivation improves, gradually increasing in power.</p><p>Given the young man surnamed Fang's cultivation level, his natal magic treasure was most likely already a middle-grade magic treasure.  He abandoned his natal magic treasure and used the blood sword instead, either because his natal magic treasure was damaged or because the blood sword was more powerful.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang sat cross-legged above the cold air cage, holding the blood sword with a solemn expression, chanting words silently.</p><p>As he chanted the incantation, the blood sword began to exhibit strange behavior. The blade trembled slightly, emitting buzzing sounds, sounding like the wails of resentful spirits.</p><p>A stronger blood energy surged out, and the blood sword slowly floated upwards, hovering above the young man surnamed Fang's head. The tip of the sword pointed obliquely towards the Kui Dragon trapped in the cage, and the blood-colored sword light flickered erratically, extremely sharp!</p><p>The Kui Dragon sensed the fluctuations of the blood sword, and this sword made it feel danger.</p><p>It stopped attacking, its huge eyes wide open, staring fixedly at the blood sword.</p><p>At this moment, the Kui Dragon's state could finally be clearly seen.</p><p>The Kui Dragon was surrounded by cold air, its scales flashing with electrical arcs, preventing the cold air from penetrating. The battle had lasted for a while, and it was also injured. Some of its scales were cracked, and even blood seeped out, forming whiplash-like marks.</p><p>Some were left by the young man's golden rope, while others were caused by the cold air within the Cold Wind and Fierce Gale Formation.</p><p>The most noticeable injury was on its tail, where large patches of scales were shattered and blood flowed freely. When it struck the cage, the Kui Dragon had also injured itself.</p><p>However, these injuries were not fatal; to this colossal creature, they were merely superficial wounds.</p><p>The Kui Dragon was still full of life, showing no signs of weakness.</p><p>It stretched its neck, glared angrily at the blood sword, sensed the threat, and opened its mouth to spew thunder, but it was firmly blocked by the now-formed cage.</p><p>The effect of the Cold Wind and Fierce Gale Formation was evident. The Kui Dragon's attacks all carried the essence of extreme Yang, difficult to resist by ordinary means, but they would annihilate along with the cold air.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others manipulated the cold air, shielding the young man surnamed Fang and bearing the Kui Dragon's attacks for him. They couldn't subdue the Kui Dragon for now, but neither could the Kui Dragon break through the formation's blockade in a short time to stop the young man surnamed Fang from activating the blood sword.</p><p>Just giving the young man surnamed Fang a little time was enough.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang didn't look down, concentrating on chanting the incantation.</p><p>The blood energy surrounding the blood sword grew increasingly dense, enveloping the sword itself, as if this evil sword was also growing, and the sword light on the blade became even more dazzling and captivating.</p><p>Unable to attack the young man, the Kui Dragon became enraged. It curled its body into a ball, resembling a massive ball of lightning. The lightning ball grew larger and larger, and terrifying energy was accumulating.</p><p>A sharp cry came from within the lightning ball, like a cry of blood. Then, with astonishing momentum, the lightning ball shot straight towards the young man.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others' expressions changed drastically. At this moment, no one dared to hold back, pouring all their vital essence into the crystal stele.</p><p>The earth trembled, and even the crystal stele began to shake.</p><p>Five visible streams of cold air quickly merged into the cage. After flickering for a moment, the cage was finally struck by the lightning ball.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>From afar, one could see a pale white cloud of air suddenly appearing beneath the dark clouds, rapidly expanding.</p><p>The Kui Dragon was fighting for its life. This was the most critical moment. Qin Sang and the others trembled, gritting their teeth and persisting, fully mobilizing the power of the spiritual formation to gather the cold air.</p><p>The cage held, unbroken by the Kui Dragon.</p><p>The Kui Dragon didn't stop. Its body retreated slightly and continued its assault. Just then, the young man surnamed Fang finally prepared his magic treasure. He lowered his head slightly, glared at the Kui Dragon, and shouted, "Sever!"</p><p>At this moment, the blood sword, merged with the blood energy, was a full ten feet long.</p><p>The sword shadow shot downwards, arriving in a flash, piercing the lightning ball without deviation. Following closely behind was the cold air of the spiritual formation, working together to suppress the Kui Dragon.</p><p>A mournful roar echoed through the sky.</p><p>A burst of blood light suddenly erupted from the lightning ball, then vanished, either the power of the blood sword or the Kui Dragon's blood, vaporized by the force of the thunder.</p><p>Then, the lightning ball suddenly became dispersed and vibrated violently.</p><p>Everyone's hearts leaped with joy. They stared intently at the lightning ball, and soon saw the violently tumbling Kui Dragon. Its body was covered in blood, the blood sword embedded in its abdomen. The blood energy on the sword squirmed like a living thing, invading its body, bringing terrible pain.</p><p>Having severely wounded the Kui Dragon with a single strike, the young man surnamed Fang's face showed joy, but a hint of vigilance and caution flashed in his eyes.</p>
