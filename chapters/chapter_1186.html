<h1>Chapter 1178: Golden Sinking Sword</h1><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue, this is one of the core artifacts for controlling the Frost Bell Formation. In the event of an attack from the Sin Abyss, you can manipulate this treasure to adapt the formation's seventy-two variations according to the situation, countering the Sin Abyss. Only a few know of the demonic allies coming to reinforce us. We hope to catch the Sin Abyss off guard, so please avoid revealing your presence in the camp to prevent spies from leaking the information," Jing Lin handed Qin Sang a blue bell and carefully instructed.</p><p>Earlier, they had secretly brought Qin Sang into the camp.</p><p>The bell was about the size of an adult's fist, crafted from an unknown spiritual material. It was ice-blue in color, with intricate runes carved both inside and out. Holding it, a cool sensation spread through his hand.</p><p>By activating the secret technique Jing Lin had passed to him, Qin Sang could sense the countless connections between the bell and the spiritual formation, instantly grasping the various transformations of the formation.</p><p>The Frost Bell Formation was highly versatile, combining both defense and offense. Its most powerful aspect lay in the seventy-two hidden frost bells surrounding the area, which could emit soundwave attacks through their chimes—formless and intangible.</p><p>Of course, they couldn't entrust the entire formation to Qin Sang's control. His role was limited to manipulating the formation through the bell, coordinating with the others to face the enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang then inquired about the recent situation and gained a general understanding. Ahead of the Threefold Pass lay another fortification, serving as the vanguard. As long as the front remained stable, the Threefold Pass would be safe for the time being.</p><p>"From now on, Fellow Daoist will oversee the central command! During ordinary times, you may cultivate in peace within the tower," Jing Lin and his companion led Qin Sang to a quiet chamber at the top of the tower, assigning him no additional tasks. This had been part of their prior agreement.</p><p>The three of them chatted at length, discussing not only the Sin Abyss and the war across the three regions but also worldly affairs, cultivation techniques, and even unorthodox methods. Qin Sang had traveled to the Canglang Sea, while Jing Lin and his companion had once ventured into the Northern Star Desert during peacetime. All were well-traveled and knowledgeable, making for a pleasant conversation.</p><p>From their words, Qin Sang gained much and felt that this journey had been worthwhile. After the lively discussion, the two took their leave.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Si, please stay. I have one more request," Qin Sang called out to Si Di.</p><p>Jing Lin tactfully excused himself.</p><p>Qin Sang stated his purpose, "Fellow Daoist, you hail from the Supreme Unity Alchemy Sect. I wonder if there are any of your sect's juniors in the camp who are skilled in alchemy. I need to refine a certain pill, and the recipe is quite complex. I would feel more at ease entrusting it to an alchemist from your sect and am willing to offer compensation."</p><p>Originally, Li Yufu could have handled this. However, as the sole disciple of the Wandering Sage, Qin Sang had left him behind in the rear. Here, he had no choice but to seek the help of an alchemist from the Supreme Unity Alchemy Sect.</p><p>"Oh? Fellow Daoist wishes to refine a pill? Leaving it to a junior might not be the most reliable. Though I am not particularly skilled, I have also studied alchemy. Coincidentally, not far east of the Threefold Pass lies a large market once operated by the Heavenly Travel Alliance, complete with ready-made fire chambers," Si Di offered to take on the task himself.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, "No need to trouble yourself, Fellow Daoist. Although the pill's refinement process is intricate, its grade is not high. It's not for my use, so a Golden Core stage junior should be capable enough."</p><p>"In that case, my junior sister Weng happens to be in the camp. She has a natural talent for alchemy and received direct teachings from our master. I'll have her come over," Si Di's fingertips glowed as he conjured a small bird, which flew out of the tower.</p><p>Shortly after, a Golden Core stage female cultivator, resembling a young girl, hurried over.</p><p>"Senior Brother, you called for me?"</p><p>The female cultivator surnamed Weng greeted everyone politely. It was her first time meeting a demon king, and she was particularly curious, especially about the pair of magnificent phoenix wings on Qin Sang's back. The stunning wings clearly had a strong impact on her, her eyes filled with envy.</p><p>After Si Di explained the situation, Qin Sang handed over the pill recipe. The female cultivator examined it carefully and confidently agreed to take on the task, waiting only for the delivery of the spiritual herbs to begin the refinement.</p><p>After seeing them off, Qin Sang closed the quiet chamber and began familiarizing himself with the Frost Bell Formation as quickly as possible.</p><p>That evening, Tan Yien reported that Tan Hao's old acquaintance was not in the area and decided to search elsewhere.</p><p>"Go with him," Qin Sang summoned Fat Chicken and ordered.</p><p>Tan Yien's travels between the various camps still posed some danger. Fat Chicken, skilled in concealment and disguise, was more than capable of ensuring his safety.</p><p>Once upon a time, Fat Chicken had been stubbornly resistant to submission, but since Qin Sang's breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage, it had become utterly obedient, even jokingly calling itself Qin Sang's lackey.</p><p>Fat Chicken puffed out its chest, promising to bring Tan Yien back safely.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed since Qin Sang arrived at the Threefold Pass.</p><p>Ten days prior, the spiritual herbs had been delivered, and the female cultivator surnamed Weng had gone to the market to refine a bottle of Fire Fusion Pills.</p><p>Qin Sang fed one pill to the Fire Jade Centipede every two days.</p><p>Surprisingly, after just two Fire Fusion Pills, the Fire Jade Centipede began to show signs of restlessness, a clear indication of an impending transformation. By the fourth pill, its body curled into a ball, spitting out a crimson cocoon of light as it fell into a deep slumber.</p><p>Qin Sang speculated that this rapid effect was due to the Fire Jade Centipede having previously consumed Crimson Fire Gold. Otherwise, the Fire Fusion Pills wouldn't have worked so swiftly.</p><p>Holding the cocoon in his hand, Qin Sang murmured incantations, casting a series of seals into the cocoon. He employed a secret technique from the Beast Taming Sect to subdue the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>After years of nurturing, the Fire Jade Centipede no longer resisted him, but only through this method would it truly acknowledge him as its master.</p><p>As the technique neared completion, a faint resistance emerged from within the cocoon—a subconscious struggle from the spirit insect. Far weaker than when awake, this was precisely why the success rate of the technique was highest at this moment.</p><p>Perhaps sensing Qin Sang's aura, the resistance quickly faded, and the technique was successfully completed.</p><p>"The Fire Jade Centipede's potential may not match that of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, but as a rare spirit insect, it should prove useful after advancing to its third transformation..."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the cocoon, recalling when the Fire Jade Centipede was only at its first transformation and could already sense the Crimson Gold Vine. Even if its treasure-seeking abilities improved, it would be worth the effort.</p><p>He didn't expect to possess another fourth-transformation spirit insect. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's advancement had been a stroke of luck, impossible to replicate.</p><p>Storing the cocoon, Qin Sang pondered for a moment before leaving the Threefold Pass and heading to the market to personally refine a flying sword.</p><p>The market was built within a canyon, where the climate was as warm as spring. It had once been a place of great renown.</p><p>With the war reaching this area, everyone had been forced to evacuate, and the market had been temporarily abandoned.</p><p>Qin Sang found a fire chamber and took out the Golden Sinking Wood and other spiritual materials.</p><p>Over the past month, he had already planned everything out. The process went smoothly, resulting in a mid-grade flying sword less than a foot long, gleaming like gold. He named it the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>Crafted primarily from Golden Sinking Wood and personally refined by Qin Sang, this sword felt more natural in his hand than other spiritual swords. It would serve as a replacement for the Ebony Sword during its unusable periods.</p><p>"The flying sword is ready. Once the seven sword souls begin merging with the seven souls, completing the first step, I can unleash a portion of the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation's power, further enhancing the sword formation's might. While the Sin Abyss remains inactive, it's best to focus on cultivation..."</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang returned to the Threefold Pass.</p><p>******</p>
