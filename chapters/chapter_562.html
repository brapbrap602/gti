<h1>Chapter 555  Tiandu Rock</h1><p>After Granny Jing left, Qin Sang went out, heading straight for the various trading houses.  After making the rounds and meeting Yun Youzi, he returned to Che Yutao's mansion just before dawn.</p><p>Qin Sang was contacting the trading houses, spreading the word that he possessed a Zimwei Secret Scroll and intended to sell it.</p><p>With Dongyang Bo's help, the Zimwei Secret Scroll was no longer needed.</p><p>He had obtained two Zimwei Secret Scrolls, but neither had been used.  The Zimwei Palace would open in less than half a year; the sooner he spread the news, the greater the chance of getting what he wanted in exchange.</p><p>Those vying for the Zimwei Secret Scrolls were mostly Golden Core cultivators. Qin Sang had researched the prices fetched at previous auctions of the scroll and had a general idea.</p><p>His proposed exchange was: a piece of Tiandu Rock, and a Wan Shi Chang tree.</p><p>At the Yinshan Pass auction years ago, when the first Zimwei Secret Scroll appeared, a mysterious Golden Core cultivator had bid a magical treasure, but it was obviously an inflated offer to attract attention.  The final price was far lower.</p><p>Sects with Yuan Ying masters didn't need the Zimwei Secret Scroll.</p><p>Smaller sects and independent cultivators might not be willing to pay such a high price for a slim chance, especially in a dangerous place, risking their lives.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a little apprehensive about requesting these two spiritual materials, unsure if he could get them.</p><p>After spreading the news, Qin Sang settled down and cultivated at Che Yutao's mansion.</p><p>He first subdued the ferocious spirits within the Xuanwu Beast Seal, then focused on helping the Flying Night Rakshasa recover.</p><p>Time flew by, and over four months passed.</p><p>Since Qin Sang released news of the Zimwei Secret Scroll, he had contacted several people, but none of the deals had materialized. To his disappointment, he still hadn't received any news about the Tiandu Rock and the Wan Shi Chang tree.</p><p>If he had, he would have found a way to buy them.</p><p>The moon hung high in the sky.</p><p>The mansion was unusually quiet, bathed in the silvery moonlight.</p><p>Time was running out; Qiu Mu Bai and the others were all working hard to subdue the ferocious spirits.</p><p>Qin Sang was studying the refining insights given to him by Shopkeeper Wu when he suddenly felt a pang in his heart. He looked down at the jade pendant at his waist and saw a faint, ethereal green glow.</p><p>This communication jade pendant was given to him by the Taiyi Dan Pavilion; its range wasn't great, barely usable within the city.</p><p>Seeing the jade pendant's strange behavior, Qin Sang's face lit up. He stood up, left Che Yutao's mansion, found a secluded spot, put on a mask, and hurried towards the Taiyi Dan Pavilion.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng has arrived!"</p><p>At the Taiyi Dan Pavilion's entrance, a servant was already waiting.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, the servant immediately led him to a quiet room, whispering, "Daoist, a senior cultivator came a quarter of an hour ago, claiming to have information about the Tiandu Rock and the Wan Shi Chang tree and wishing to exchange it for your Zimwei Secret Scroll. He asked for you to come."</p><p>"Just information, not the actual items?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, his brow furrowed.</p><p>"He didn't specify," the servant shook his head. "The senior cultivator refused to reveal details, insisting on seeing you and the Zimwei Secret Scroll in person to discuss. He didn't hide his identity; it's the Fengjian Sect's Sect Master, Old Man Bajian. He shouldn't be lying to us."</p><p>"Both of them?"</p><p>"He said he has information on both."</p><p>â€¦</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, recalling information about the Fengjian Sect from his memory.</p><p>The Fengjian Sect was once a powerful sect similar to the Eight Great Righteous Sects. After its Yuan Ying ancestor passed away, its subsequent generations faltered and it gradually declined.</p><p>Now it's a minor sect, but its Sect Master, Old Man Bajian, is somewhat famous; his signature flying sword can split into eight, and his swordsmanship is exquisite.</p><p>However, he's quite old and only at the early Golden Core stage, not a leader capable of revitalizing the sect.</p><p>The Fengjian Sect is also known for its sword techniques, but unlike Mount Shaohua, its disciples are true sword cultivators, adhering to the principle of going straight ahead rather than taking a roundabout way.</p><p>Old Man Bajian must consider the reputation of his sect.  The Fengjian Sect currently depends on the Yuling Sect, and most of its disciples are active near Jiuyong Pass. His journey here was surely not for leisure.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang calmed down, pushed open the door, and saw a man of about fifty, with a goatee, sitting in the room, accompanied by a Taiyi Dan Pavilion manager.</p><p>"I apologize for keeping you waiting, senior."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, expressing his apologies.</p><p>Old Man Bajian didn't act superior despite being a Golden Core cultivator; he immediately stood up to greet him, not minding Qin Sang's mask. He smiled, "It's I who have disturbed Daoist; please, come in."</p><p>The Taiyi Dan Pavilion manager acted as a witness.</p><p>The two sat opposite each other, exchanged a few pleasantries, and then got straight to the point.</p><p>"Senior, please have a look."</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried about his treasure being stolen; he directly took out the Zimwei Secret Scroll and handed it to Old Man Bajian for inspection.</p><p>The authenticity of the Ziwei Secret was easily verified.  Seeing the phantom of the Ziwei Palace, the Eight Swords Elder returned the secret to Qin Sang, then pondered for a moment before saying, "Master Qingfeng, this exchange must include both the Tiandu Rock and the Wan Shi Zhang, is that correct?"</p><p>The crucial part begins.</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely, "That's right. I'm gathering materials to refine a magical artifact, and these two are the most difficult to find."</p><p>The Eight Swords Elder looked at Qin Sang, then suddenly changed his tone. "If I'm not mistaken, Master, you haven't achieved Golden Core yet, have you?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and countered, "My cultivation level shouldn't hinder our transaction, should it?"</p><p>"No, no," the Eight Swords Elder quickly shook his head. "To be honest, I only have one piece of Tiandu Rock. However, I'm willing to offer a spiritual item that aids in Golden Core formation in place of the Wan Shi Zhang.  It's a mid-grade item.  What do you think, Master?"</p><p>With that, the Eight Swords Elder produced a stone resembling an inkstone and placed it before Qin Sang.</p><p>The Tiandu Rock was pitch black, with an incredibly fine texture.  A peculiar luster emanated from its surface, and cloud-like grey patterns appeared and disappeared, making it quite unique.</p><p>Qin Sang confirmed it was genuine Tiandu Rock, and his heart leaped with joy.  After all this time, he had finally found one.</p><p>However, exchanging the Ziwei Secret for just a single Tiandu Rock left Qin Sang unsatisfied.</p><p>Remaining calm, he slowly shook his head. "With all due respect, Senior, I'm confident in achieving Golden Core, so an item to assist in that process is of no use to me."</p><p>The Eight Swords Elder looked at him in surprise, likely never having encountered such an audacious individual.  He frowned, then considered for a moment before saying,  "Master, have you investigated the market? The highest price ever paid for these Ziwei Secrets was merely three fist-sized pieces of Star Sand Steel. Your asking price is far too high, and no compromise is possible. Let's try this instead..."</p><p>The Eight Swords Elder said seriously, "I don't have Wan Shi Zhang, but I once saw a jade slip in a hidden realm that mentioned where this material grows, often attracting a type of symbiotic beast. I'll give you the jade slip. Following its instructions, you'll be able to find the Wan Shi Zhang. That's better than blindly searching, wouldn't you agree?"</p>
