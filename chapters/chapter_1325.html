<h1>Chapter 1317: Fire-Eating Beasts</h1><p>“Junior Yun Lan, an attendant of the Xu Ling Sect, greets Senior Qin.  Is this Senior Qin?”</p><p>Four Xu Ling Sect disciples—three men and one woman—flew before Qin Sang.  Upon seeing his face, they were visibly surprised and bowed respectfully.</p><p>Surprisingly, the female disciple was a Golden Core cultivator.  A Golden Core cultivator guarding the gate.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Qing Jun’s earlier assessment: the Xu Ling Sect had silently profited handsomely from the war.  Now, it seemed true.  The resources of the Qing Yang Sect simply couldn't compare to these established schools.</p><p>The woman appeared to be in her twenties, with a graceful figure, pretty features, and a red court dress. She was the one who had spoken.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal his identity. He was now quite famous throughout Bei Chen, and few cultivators in the two realms wouldn't recognize him.  The female cultivator identified him at a glance.</p><p>“It is I,” Qin Sang said calmly, nodding. “I made a prior arrangement with Daoist Bing Han.  I have some free time today and have come to pay a visit. Please inform her.”</p><p>Yun Lan’s face lit up.  “There’s no need to announce you. Senior Qin, please come with me. I’ve been waiting for you here on orders from our Sect Master.”</p><p>“Oh? Daoist Bing Han is thoughtful.  I shall accept your kind offer.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.</p><p>Yun Lan gestured for the other three disciples to retreat, then led the way.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately slowed his pace, leisurely observing the surroundings.</p><p>Flying over the dormant volcanoes, Qin Sang noticed some cat-sized creatures, neither quite leopard nor cat, running wildly through the mountains. They possessed unusually long, fluffy tails—twice their body length.</p><p>Their fur was entirely crimson red, without a single other color, with a bright sheen as if molten rock flowed through their coats. Only their eyes were black.</p><p>The creatures were busy searching the ground.</p><p>As Qin Sang and Yun Lan flew past, they lifted their heads, their gazes gentle, with a touch of innocence and curiosity.  They tilted their heads, glanced at them, then returned to their task.</p><p>Behind the creatures, some Xu Ling Sect disciples were panting, having been led on a chase by them.  Upon seeing Yun Lan, they quickly bowed.</p><p>“These are your sect’s famed Fire-Eating Beasts, are they not?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>While other sects didn’t specialize in beast-keeping like the Yu Ling Sect, they weren’t without similar arts.  Any beast selected and cultivated by them would possess special abilities.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Fire-Eating Beasts showed no killing intent in their eyes; they seemed like innocent children who had never experienced battle.</p><p>“Yes, they are Fire-Eating Beasts.  However, many rumors are inaccurate and don’t do them justice—certainly not to your standards, Senior Qin,” Yun Lan chuckled. Seeing Qin Sang’s curiosity, she explained. “People say Fire-Eating Beasts have incredible abilities, but they’re actually referring to another beast, the Crimson-Tailed Leopard, similar in appearance.  Of course, we deliberately spread this misinformation to protect the Fire-Eating Beasts. Their innate ability is fire control; they help us stabilize the spiritual flames during refinement, increasing our success rate.  They actually have very little combat ability.”</p><p>Yun Lan pointed to the ground.  “The Fire-Eating Beasts are foraging.  But their diet is unusual; they eat the unrefined fiery qi from the underground flame veins.  The flame veins have been unstable lately, shaking out the fiery qi buried deep underground.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked in the direction she indicated.</p><p>He saw one Fire-Eating Beast sense something. It let out a high-pitched cry and suddenly plunged into the ground, digging a large hole.</p><p>A wisp of red smoke rose from the ground, like a living thing, fleeing into the distance.</p><p>The surrounding Fire-Eating Beasts immediately swarmed forward and devoured the smoke.</p><p>Subsequently, fiery qi erupted from the cracks in the ground. This delighted the Fire-Eating Beasts, who chirped happily, scrambling to consume it.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's attention was on the ground.</p><p>His senses detected an unexpected surge in the underground flame veins.  The surge wasn’t strong; otherwise, much more fiery qi would have erupted.  However, the source of the surge was clearly within the depths of the Xu Ling Sect. Even after being weakened by the protective array, it still caused this commotion—intriguing indeed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained outwardly calm, withdrawing his gaze.</p><p>Yun Lan couldn’t possibly guess Qin Sang’s thoughts and continued to lead the way.</p><p>Soon, they passed through an invisible barrier.  The surrounding heat dissipated, replaced by a gentle spring-like warmth.</p><p>The landscape ahead was no longer desolate, but lush and vibrant with life.  This place, near the Xu Ling Sect's mountain gate, was where underground fiery veins converged, yet it thrived surprisingly. Deep within the jungle stood a mountain, not particularly tall, but exceptionally wide – an unusual sight.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the mountain, recalling her prior knowledge of the Xu Ling Sect. This mountain was their most important forbidden area. Its summit wasn't flat, but a massive volcanic crater. The legendary "Mountain within a Mountain" was said to be within its depths.</p><p>Along the way, they encountered many Xu Ling Sect disciples. Upon seeing Yun Lan, they all respectfully bowed, casting curious glances at Qin Sang. Some recognized her, their faces registering shock.</p><p>Qin Sang observed that regardless of their cultivation level, these disciples were all spirited, full of energy, and exceptionally talented, a testament to the Sect's resources and Bing Han's training methods.  After this, she should ask Bing Han for advice on managing a sect.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang was surprised to find Yun Lan leading her directly towards the forbidden area, without pausing.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Moments later, they arrived at a beautiful palace halfway up the mountain, named Yan Huo Pavilion.  Qin Sang, noting the absence of any restrictions, swept her spiritual sense inside, finding it empty. She frowned slightly.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of light descended from the sky, landing in Yun Lan's palm.  A hint of surprise flickered in Yun Lan's eyes before she hesitated, a troubled expression on her face.  "Senior Qin," she said, "I've just received word that the Sect Master is in deep cultivation within the Mountain within a Mountain.  It's a crucial time, and she can't be disturbed. Please rest at Yan Huo Pavilion for a few days. I hope you won't mind."</p><p>"It seems I've come at an inopportune time," Qin Sang replied. "Since Daoist Bing Han is busy, waiting a few days is no problem."  She wasn't going to trouble a junior, and waved her hand dismissively before entering the hall.</p><p>Relieved, Yun Lan personally prepared some spiritual fruits and celestial wine, but Qin Sang declined.  Qin Sang instructed Yun Lan not to be overly courteous, to simply call her when Bing Han was free, and then sealed Yan Huo Pavilion with a restriction, isolating it.  Yun Lan, however, dared not be negligent and remained guard outside, awaiting instructions.</p><p>After inspecting Yan Huo Pavilion and confirming the absence of any unusual restrictions, Qin Sang opened her spirit beast pouch. A red glow shot into her hand – the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede struggled furiously in Qin Sang's palm, unable to escape.</p>
