<h1>Chapter 936: Confirmation</h1><p>Qin Sang glanced at Bai.</p><p>"If that person was waiting for you, how could you have easily discovered them? I knew you were likely coming, and sensing the tremors, I came to guard this place. Shortly after you entered, they arrived. This person has set up some kind of formation outside.  Inevitably, there were flaws when setting it up, which I noticed. I can't see their true form, but a spirit formation can't be completely flawless. Carefully observe those few spots…"</p><p>Bai's voice transmitted, guiding Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was very curious which Nascent Soul ancestor was targeting him.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly activated its divine ability, scanning the canyon back and forth.</p><p>No figure was visible, but Qin Sang felt a sense of unease.</p><p>"I can use the Ghost Mist to disrupt the demonic restriction and force them to reveal themselves. Every tremor is followed by instability in the demonic restriction. This is normal, so don't worry about alerting them," Bai offered.</p><p>"No rush!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment, then called out. The Sky-Eye Butterfly flew out from his dantian, danced gracefully, and landed on his shoulder.</p><p>The tremors Bai mentioned should be the aftershocks caused each time the Immortal Formation outside was attacked. Seven Kills Hall was sealed by the Immortal Formation, and when the formation was disturbed, the inside would also be affected.</p><p>Seeing the Sky-Eye Butterfly, Bai was somewhat dazed. This guy was actually hiding a third-transformation spirit insect.</p><p>"I lost fair and square," Bai thought to himself, the resentment in his heart inexplicably dissipating.</p><p>After summoning the Sky-Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang commanded his avatar and the Twin-Headed Ghost Lizard to stay alert. Then he slowly closed his eyes, communicating with the Sky-Eye Butterfly with his mind, urging his divine sense to settle on the butterfly.</p><p>This was a Witch Clan secret technique, used in conjunction with a natal Gu insect.</p><p>The master and the Gu insect work together to enhance the power of the divine ability temporarily. The forbidden secret technique used by the Fang youth before his death was of this type, but the secret technique Qin Sang was using now was much gentler, and naturally, its power was not as strong as a forbidden secret technique.</p><p>Using this secret technique would greatly consume the master's divine sense, and Qin Sang couldn't maintain it for long.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, its wings spread, facing the canyon.</p><p>After several transformations and mutations, the patterns on the Sky-Eye Butterfly's wings were extremely beautiful. The eye-like patterns were aesthetically pleasing, without the slightest hint of horror.</p><p>The eye patterns resembled real eyes, and their gaze seemed to be able to move.</p><p>No matter where one stood, there was the illusion of being watched by the Sky-Eye.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense merged with the Sky-Eye Butterfly, activating the Sky-Eye divine ability together.</p><p>The patterns on the butterfly's wings lit up, becoming even more captivating, making it hard to look away. Light continuously flowed towards the Sky-Eye in the center, making it radiant.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly's wings trembled slightly, making one worry if its small and fragile body could withstand it without being harmed.</p><p>At this moment, the 'pupil' in the Sky-Eye actually moved, turning into a real eye, staring intently at the canyon outside the demonic flames.</p><p>Silently, the Sky-Eye scanned the canyon inch by inch.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang signaled to Bai, "Thirty percent strength!"</p><p>Without any visible movement from Bai, the Ghost Mist behind them suddenly pressed down towards the ground. Then, the ground trembled slightly, and the demonic flames floating at the entrance of the canyon swayed, releasing a bit of demonic fire power. The ancient restrictions on the stone walls also fluctuated slightly, then quickly returned to normal.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang helped the Sky-Eye Butterfly fully activate its divine ability.</p><p>The moment the demonic restriction fluctuated, Qin Sang's expression changed, his face becoming grave.</p><p>At the entrance of the canyon, on a section of the stone wall, the texture was as hard and dense as iron, covered with ancient restrictions. Other than that, it looked empty.</p><p>This was one of the spots Bai had pointed out.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly, however, detected a slight fluctuation there. The fluctuation was extremely subtle, as if a small, square phantom had flashed by. If Qin Sang hadn't been alerted by Bai, he wouldn't have noticed such a minor anomaly.</p><p>The reason why peculiar insects were rare was that their innate divine abilities far surpassed ordinary spirit insects, possessing the ability to transcend their cultivation level. If the Sky-Eye Butterfly broke through to the late stage of the third transformation, it could even see through the concealment techniques of Nascent Soul ancestors.</p><p>With Qin Sang's help, the Sky-Eye Butterfly's divine ability greatly increased, no less than that of the late stage of the third transformation.</p><p>If someone was really lying in wait, only a Nascent Soul ancestor could conceal themselves so perfectly, and their cultivation might even be higher than he had anticipated!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>A moment later, everything returned to normal.</p><p>At the canyon entrance, a figure sat cross-legged in the shadows like an old monk in meditation. It was Old Devil Mou, who had escaped.</p><p>He had rushed to the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone without stopping and discovered traces in the canyon. The person he was looking for had once again passed through the demonic fire blockade and entered that unknown ghostly land.</p><p>Old Devil Mou was both surprised and delighted.</p><p>If he had been a bit faster, he might have captured the person directly. Now, he could only lie in wait outside.</p><p>Just now, Old Devil Mou had been observing the other Nascent Soul cultivators and hadn't noticed any unusual actions from them. This indicated that the one who had passed through the demonic fire and entered the ghostly land was likely a Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>Unless some old fellow, like him, had used some method to escape and arrive earlier.</p><p>Old Devil Mou was uncertain.</p><p>This was a demonic fire that even he and those late Nascent Soul cultivators feared. Since ancient times, no one had ever entered the ghostly land. For a mere Core Formation cultivator to do so was simply unbelievable.</p><p>To be safe, he had taken extra precautions, setting up a spirit formation, preparing to ambush the person when they came out.</p><p>Sensing the subtle fluctuation of the demonic restriction, Old Devil Mou lifted his eyelids, his gaze sweeping across the demonic fire and the ghostly land, but he didn't find anything unusual.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang and Bai had retreated back into the depths of the Ghost Mist.</p><p>"It seems you've discovered something! You don't have to see their true form to believe me, do you?"</p><p>Bai, occupying the Flying Night Fiend's body, smirked.</p><p>His smile was chilling in the eerie ghostly land.</p><p>"That's enough!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was preoccupied, as if he was pondering something. Then, he gazed into Bai's eyes and said, "I can be sure that there was nothing unusual there when I entered. I can tell that you and the resentful souls are afraid of the demonic restriction. The restriction is aimed at you! It's impossible to tamper with it outside the ghostly land, otherwise you would have left long ago. Doing so unnecessarily would alert that person, making my situation even more dangerous."</p><p>A satisfied expression appeared on Bai's face. "It seems you're also a clever one. Now we can talk about the deal."</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang raised a hand. "That person couldn't have come in with me. The problem must lie here! You've been trapped in the ghostly land. This shouldn't be the first time you've seen them, right? What else do you know? What's their cultivation level?"</p><p>"Indeed, this isn't the first time this person has appeared. Shortly after you left last time, they came again. As for their strength…"</p><p>Bai fell into recollection, a grave expression appearing on his face. "Among those who have appeared before and been detected by me, the strongest was only at the late Nascent Soul stage. They revealed their aura once, only slightly weaker than a late Nascent Soul cultivator."</p><p>"Just below late Nascent Soul…"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled upon hearing this.</p><p>It matched his previous judgment. This person was at least a mid-Nascent Soul expert!</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Failed to adjust sleep schedule.</p>
