<h1>Chapter 133 Seeking Advice on Cultivation</h1><p>Chapter 133 Seeking Advice on Cultivation</p><p>(The previous chapter was a bit ambiguous, and some readers seemed to have misunderstood, so I've revised it.</p><p>Previously, there was no preface to the books I read, and I liked to accumulate a number of chapters before reading. As a result, I didn't pay much attention to many things. Only after I started writing books did I discover many problems.</p><p>It's unnecessary to bury some foreshadowing since it doesn't help the plot, and instead, it could cause misunderstandings for readers who follow the updates. Sometimes, if you write a sentence for the next chapter, it would come across as deliberately enigmatic. It's better to write things clearly.</p><p>Writing books is indeed a technical skill. You only learn about many pitfalls after you've stepped into them. I'm still a beginner. I'll try my best to correct my mistakes.)</p><p>Even more frightening was that his foundation had been damaged, which would also affect his future breakthroughs. Qin Sang had very little hope of forming his golden core in the first place. If he wanted to attempt to form a golden core, he had to seize any opportunity that could increase his chances and eliminate any negative factors. As such, he first needed to find a way to restore his foundation.</p><p>Judging from what Sect Master Yu and the Gu-surnamed cultivator had said, restoring his foundation would be very difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in seclusion in his cave dwelling for ten days before he managed to stabilize his cultivation base and recover his physical health.</p><p>However, he was still unable to cultivate for the time being.</p><p>The Profound Jade Caldron True Scripture could not be used as his fundamental cultivation technique. He didn't have a cultivation technique for the Foundation Establishment stage yet. He had to wait until he went to Sect Master Peak to exchange his jade tablet. Only then would he be eligible to go to the Pagoda Peak to choose one.</p><p>But he knew nothing about the Foundation Establishment stage. He didn't know which cultivation technique was good or bad, and even less so which cultivation technique was suitable for his废材资质.</p><p>Choosing a cultivation technique was extremely important for cultivators. If he could choose a cultivation technique that suited him, his cultivation would progress twice as fast, and his advancement would be smooth. Only then would he have more possibilities in the future.</p><p>But he had merely been a Qi Condensation stage cultivator in the past. Of the Foundation Establishment stage cultivators, he only knew Senior Uncle Wen. He had successfully formed his foundation out of nowhere, so he hadn't had the opportunity to learn about these things.</p><p>Now, he had two paths before him. One was to ask for advice from a fellow Foundation Establishment stage cultivator, and the second was to hope that one of the sect's Nascent Soul realm seniors would accept him as their personal disciple.</p><p>If he could receive guidance from a Nascent Soul realm elder, that would be ideal. He could avoid taking many detours. But his innate talent was already very poor, and now his qi sea had also shrunk by 10%. Even without this setback, which Nascent Soul realm elder would be blind enough to take a fancy to him?</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly to himself. He realized that even though he had successfully formed his foundation, the road ahead was still rugged and thorny.</p><p>After completely refining the medicinal power of the Nine Yang Pill, Qin Sang left his cave dwelling.</p><p>Ten days had passed. Mount Shao Hua seemed to have forgotten about him. No one had visited him at all.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment before summoning his flying shuttle.</p><p>The first place he naturally wanted to go was Sect Master Peak to exchange his jade tablet. When he arrived at the Sect Master's grand hall, he learned from a Daoist boy that Sect Master Yu wasn't in the sect at the moment.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for a while, but Sect Master Yu still didn't return. After thinking for a while, he set off to fly to Dao Pavilion Peak.</p><p>He landed his遁光 in front of the wooden palace. Just as he arrived, he saw several youths laughing and chatting as they walked out of the wooden palace. They were all Qi Condensation stage cultivators, and Qin Sang recognized all of them.</p><p>Whenever a Senior Uncle gave a sermon, he would return from the Earthly Abyss Cave to listen to it. He wasn't close with many of his fellow sect disciples, but he was familiar with their faces.</p><p>Among these people, there was a young man called Qian Yuanzhu who had even discussed the art of cloud evasion with Qin Sang.</p><p>When he suddenly saw Qin Sang, Qian Yuanzhu's eyes lit up. He raised his hand and greeted him, "Hey! Junior Brother Qin..."</p><p>As soon as he uttered those words, Qian Yuanzhu was suddenly yanked hard by the young man next to him.</p><p>The young man bowed deeply and saluted Qin Sang with great respect. "Disciple Zhou Yan greets Uncle Qin."</p><p>The other people did the same.</p><p>Qian Yuanzhu was stunned. Only then did he realize that Qin Sang was already a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator. The people who used to be his equals could no longer compare with him.</p><p>His lips twitched as he saluted Qin Sang in panic. "Disciple was rude just now and offended Uncle Qin. Please be magnanimous."</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang wouldn't mind something so trivial and said, "Brother Qian, why do you need to stand on ceremony with me?"</p><p>But Qian Yuanzhu became even more flustered and said repeatedly, "Disciple doesn't dare."</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang suddenly realize that his identity had changed. There was now an insurmountable gulf between them. Unless Qian Yuanzhu was able to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, the two who used to be acquaintances would gradually drift apart and never be able to return to their old relationship.</p><p>In the cultivation world, strength was respected, and the hierarchy was strict.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly and no longer tried to do unnecessary things. His tone became cold and distant. Qian Yuanzhu and the others' expressions relaxed a lot compared to before. After bidding farewell, they left in a hurry.</p><p>Qin Sang only turned around to enter the wooden pavilion when their figures had disappeared. Fortunately, he didn't meet Zhuang Yan in the wooden pavilion.</p><p>Zhuang Yan was the person who Qin Sang got along with the best on Mount Shao Hua. Qin Sang had gotten the opportunity to sell his body to form his foundation this time, thanks to Zhuang Yan informing him in time. If he had also been like Qian Yuanzhu and the others, Qin Sang wouldn't have been able to be happy.</p><p>"Congratulations to Junior Brother Qin for forming his foundation!"</p><p>He used to call him Uncle Wen, but now he should call him Senior Brother Wen.</p><p>He seemed to have known beforehand about Qin Sang cracking the hurdle and stood up with a smile and congratulations as soon as he came in.</p><p>"I didn't expect that Junior Apprentice Qin actually has such a strong will. Not only did you get through the Bao Gourd Illusion, you also gained the recognition of Uncle Ma Wu. Senior Apprentice Brother is ashamed, just staying in the Illusion for a few hours and barely escaped getting enchanted. Compared to Junior Apprentice Qin, I'm a long way off!"</p><p>Seeing that Senior Apprentice Brother Wen's tone of voice was a bit ingratiating, Qin Sang paused a little before understanding right away.</p><p>Aside from Head Master Yu and the six others who broke through the Bao Gourd Illusion, no one else knew the truth. They really thought that he had become Ma Wu Zhen Ren's dual cultivation partner.</p><p>This matter must have already spread throughout Mount Shaohua. No wonder that Money Yuan Zhu's companions looked at him strangely earlier.</p><p>Those who know you best are yourself.</p><p>Qin Sang understood in his heart that he had no powerful backer. This was just a deal, and even Fairy Chen Yan wouldn't care about the life or death of a dregs of medicine.</p><p>But he wouldn't be so stupid as to expose himself. First, he didn't dare to break the secret. Second, by pretending to be Real Person Ma Wu, as long as he acted modestly and got out while the going was good, he didn't need to be explicit about it, and there would be many hidden benefits.</p><p>He had originally planned on asking Senior Apprentice Brother Wen for cultivation method guidance, but that wasn't going to happen now.</p><p>Qin Sang and Senior Apprentice Brother Wen chatted for a while over tea, and then said, "Senior Apprentice Brother Wen, I just went to Head Master Peak, but Senior Apprentice Brother Head Master wasn't in the Sect and hasn't changed my jade scroll yet. It's still from when I was in the Qi Refining Period. Can a Senior Apprentice Brother from Pagoda Peak help out?"</p><p>Senior Apprentice Brother Wen said generously, "What's so difficult about that? If Junior Apprentice Brother Qin isn't at ease, first take my jade waist tag and use it. They definitely wouldn't dare to make things difficult for you."</p><p>Having taken the jade waist tag, Qin Sang came to Pagoda Peak and first went to the hall that held the foreign method books such as alchemy, enchanted instruments, and talismans.</p><p>The hall's warden was a cultivator named Zhang. He was currently napping in his chair, with tea on the table. Judging by his age, he was likely already very old. Only someone who had given up on his immortal path would be so lazy.</p><p>"Qin Sang greets Senior Apprentice Brother Zhang." Qin Sang greeted him with cupped hands.</p><p>That Senior Apprentice Brother Zhang stretched and opened his turbid eyes. It was as if he had been woken from a sweet dream. His expression was a bit of dissatisfaction. But upon hearing Qin Sang's self-introduction, Senior Apprentice Brother Zhang was suddenly startled and leaned forward to look at Qin Sang. "Which Qin Sang are you?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and said, "From what I know, there should only be one Qin Sang in Mount Shaohua. Has Senior Apprentice Brother Zhang seen other Qin Sangs before?"</p><p>"No, no..."</p><p>Senior Apprentice Brother Zhang waved his hand repeatedly and stood up. He said fervently, "This Senior Apprentice Brother was caught in a daze. Junior Apprentice Qin, don't take offense. I wonder what business has brought Junior Apprentice Qin here?"</p>
