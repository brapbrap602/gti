<h1>Chapter 1231: Unsealing</h1><p>The ancient forbidden cloud formations were stained crimson, a miasma of blood energy spreading everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the blood miasma at the edge of the Wuyagu Valley was formed by this blood energy.</p><p>Through the ancient prohibitions, one could faintly see the edge of the Blood Lake. It was less than half the size of the Yuanxu Abyss, but the aura emanating from it was identical, allowing Fat Chicken to recognize it instantly.</p><p>The blood in the Blood Lake seemed to flow from nothingness, rootless water.</p><p>At this moment, the Blood Lake's seal was turbulent, with surging waves of blood.</p><p>This not only affected the surrounding area but also other parts of the inner valley.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the Blood Lake's seal closely, sensing that this was just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>He secretly ordered the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to use its abilities to gaze upon the Blood Lake, but within its vision, there was only endless blood, nothing else.</p><p>"After you brought back news last time, we've been collecting information about the Wuyagu Valley and the Blood Lake, researching them together. We have several theories about the Blood Lake,"</p><p>Xiang Qing approached, hands behind his back, watching the Blood Lake. "In ancient times, the two Blood Lakes were probably one.  We don't know what caused their separation. Since the seal isn't completely severed, even across half of the Beichen Realm, the internal spaces should still be connected. The great abilities of ancient cultivators are truly awe-inspiring."</p><p>Qin Sang asked, "So, these two forbidden lands originated from the same place? One fell to Tianhen, forming the Yuanxu Abyss, and the other fell here, forming the Wuyagu Valley?"</p><p>Xiang Qing nodded. "That's highly likely. You mentioned before that you suspected the Yuanxu Abyss was used to suppress an ancient demon.  But unbeknownst to many, Wuyagu Valley was once like the Yuanxu Abyss, with many independent seals.  However, they were severely damaged, unlike the Yuanxu Abyss which remained relatively intact. Eventually it became the inner valley we see now, a perilous place filled with fragmented seals. Even if there were ancient cultivators suppressed here, they would have perished long ago."</p><p>Xiang Qing looked towards the boundless north.</p><p>"Don't forget, the Ziwei Palace and the Zuishen Palace are even farther apart, yet they're connected through a demonic passage. This proves that the Zuishen Palace, and even the Yuanxu Abyss, were once parts of the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>"It seems that the famous secret realms in our Beichen Realm are all related to the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>"Unlike the ancient cultivator's caves in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the Ziwei Palace didn't originally belong to the Beichen Realm. It was struck down from an unknown place.</p><p>"In those days, a great catastrophe struck the Ziwei Palace. Perhaps the master of the Ziwei Palace encountered an insurmountable foe, their mountain gate shattered, countless fragments falling to the world."</p><p>Xiang Qing's theory was widely accepted as the most probable.</p><p>The boundless storm surrounding the Beichen Realm shows that a terrible war must have occurred in ancient times, causing this everlasting devastation.</p><p>The shattering of the Ziwei Palace is not surprising.</p><p>The main body of the Ziwei Palace fell to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the Zuishen Palace landed in Tianhen, spanning the entire Beichen Realm.</p><p>The Wuyagu Valley might be a larger fragment, while smaller fragments, after the prohibitions shattered, have long since been erased.</p><p>Qin Sang knew more.</p><p>Besides the Zuishen Palace, there was the Qisha Hall, deeply connected to the Ziwei Palace, located in the distant Canglang Sea.</p><p>Xiang Qing gazed at the sky, his face full of longing. "Above the nine heavens, or deep within the storm, there must be a much broader world. I wonder if I'll ever have the chance to break free from this cage…"</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>He had traveled to Xiaohan Domain, the Canglang Sea, and the Yaohai, and every cultivator aware of the storm belt regarded it as a cage, hoping one day to escape.</p><p>After this sigh, they returned to the topic of the Blood Lake.</p><p>"In that case, could there also be an ancient demon suppressed within the Blood Lake?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Blood Lake, his brows furrowed.</p><p>Xiang Qing hummed in agreement. "We've considered that possibility. However, an ancient demon that survived to this day, if released, what would the consequences be? Elder Ye wouldn't be unaware of that. Even if Elder Ye has gone mad, others wouldn't follow suit. Of course, we've made some preparations…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.</p><p>In the Qisha Hall, the release of the ancient demon was purely coincidental.</p><p>Only the three major trading alliance leaders and Qingzhu Demon Soul were manipulated by the ancient demon, each with their own motives.</p><p>If the Jiao Dragon King, the Great Witch Priest, the Demon Lord, and Lingzhuzi had known how terrifying the ancient demon was, they wouldn't have dared to have such thoughts.</p><p>A demon might be able to deceive Elder Ye, but it couldn't command the entire Zuibian to serve him. Otherwise, why go through so much trouble?</p><p>Yuan Ying masters were shrewd individuals, not easily fooled.</p><p>Another piece of evidence is that when the Blood Mulberry appeared, the Blood Lake seal was opened once, revealing a hellish scene inside.  If any ancient demons survived, they would have escaped then.</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Hong also approached and added this.</p><p>The righteous and demonic cultivators of Xiaohan Region jointly found a record from a Nascent Soul cultivator's remains, a cultivator who had once participated in the struggle for the Blood Mulberry.</p><p>While the three spoke, the Golden Core cultivators stood respectfully at the periphery, not daring to approach.</p><p>Several hours later, Lord Tongyou and Qing Jun arrived together.</p><p>Qin Sang, the only demon king present, stood apart, casually watching their actions, his gaze occasionally sweeping over Dongyang Bo, a glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>The enemy is in the open; I am in the shadows.</p><p>In the treacherous and unknown Blood Lake, it’s easier to find opportunities. A Nascent Soul master's bad luck led to their death inside; afterwards, no one could find any trace.</p><p>This is undoubtedly the best opportunity for revenge.</p><p>With the eighteen demonic banners forming a great array, Qin Sang was confident that his strength was not inferior to Lord Tongyou and the others, and that he could likely surpass Dongyang Bo, but this didn't mean he could kill Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Controlling demonic fire through the banners, it's difficult to be completely thorough.</p><p>Dongyang Bo leads a major sect, possesses countless treasures, and has numerous life-saving techniques. If he wants to escape, the chances of capturing him are slim.</p><p>In that case, Qin Sang would be exposed and revealed.</p><p>With Dongyang Bo on his guard, it would be even harder to find another chance.</p><p>In Qin Sang's mind, the most opportune moment would be after the fire lotus seed sprouts and Bai advances to become a Corpse King.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, regretting his circumstances.</p><p>They found the bone incantation too late, and it was incomplete.  Unfortunately, it was also the crucial moment for Bai’s understanding of the incantation.</p><p>Ye Laomo should have acted slower.</p><p>Otherwise, with Bai's help, and waiting for Dongyang Bo to be alone, there would have been a high chance of taking him down.</p><p>Even if they killed Dongyang Bo, with Bai, their side wouldn't lose much combat power. Bai's origins are mysterious, and he's not to be underestimated.  After his breakthrough, his strength will surpass that of ordinary Corpse Kings.</p><p>Bai is seeking lost memories and is very interested in secret realms; he would certainly be willing to come.</p><p>…</p><p>Lord Tongyou and others deployed a spirit array above the Blood Lake.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivators retreated far away, and several more arrived during this time.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped aside, and saw Dongyang Bo and Lord Tongyou each guarding an array eye, jointly activating the array to forcefully strike the seal!</p>
