Chapter 1299: The Traitor

A moment later.

The group swiftly descended the mountain.

This time, their expressions carried a hint of confidence and joy. Each employed their own methods to conceal their auras and hide their forms as they rushed toward the direction of Yu City.

Their path seemed chaotic and without pattern, yet they moved smoothly, arriving near Yu City without alerting anyone.

Outside Yu City.

Qin Sang and the others emerged from the shadows, observing the large city. Seeing the chaos within, they did not hesitate and charged straight into the Lotus Formation!

...

Among the three Nascent Soul cultivators left to guard Yu City, one bore the surname Qi. He had connections with both Canghong Zhenren and Tianzheng Laoren, two esteemed figures of the righteous path, and was highly regarded.

At this moment, Qi was standing on the city walls, personally overseeing the defense.

Though the enemy's main force had yet to arrive, the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Two Realms Alliance had already gathered. Even with the protection of the city's defensive formation, the situation was extremely precarious.

Worried about the battle, Qi wore a deep frown.

Unexpectedly, his earlier words had come true. The Two Realms Alliance's intelligence network was far more extensive than they had anticipated. They had arrived so quickly, descending like divine soldiers, catching them completely off guard.

He stared intently at the figures outside the city, not daring to relax for a moment.

Fortunately, the soldiers of the Sin Abyss were battle-hardened and worked in perfect coordination. At a single command, a flood of attacks was unleashed, pouring into the formation.

Though Qin Sang and the others were Nascent Soul cultivators, they were still within the enemy's formation and under concentrated fire. They dared not be careless, dodging and weaving, which inadvertently slowed their progress in breaking the formation.

Seeing this, Qi's expression did not lighten.

Canghong Zhenren had gone to pursue Ye Laomo and had yet to return, leaving Yu City at its most vulnerable.

With a lack of powerful experts, all they could do was defend and delay. They could not sally forth to engage the enemy, nor did they have the means to threaten their lives. This allowed the enemy to act without restraint, charging recklessly through the formation.

If this continued, it was only a matter of time before the city's defensive formation was breached.

Just then, a hurried voice came from the distance.

"Fellow Daoist Qi, the situation is dire. The previous defensive formation was built to complement the Dark Crystal Tower. With the tower destroyed, the formation has been compromised, revealing flaws. They arrived too quickly, and we had no time to repair it! With only the three of us left in the city, we cannot possibly seal all the breaches. Once they discover them, Yu City is doomed!"

The voice grew closer.

In the next moment, a figure flew up to the city walls. It was another Nascent Soul cultivator left to guard Yu City, named Qu Huan.

Seeing the critical state of the battle, Qu Huan hurried over to discuss with Qi.

Landing beside Qi, Qu Huan glanced at the remnants of the Dark Crystal Tower and sighed softly.

The base of the tower remained intact, but the structure itself was in ruins. Some parts were riddled with cracks, while others had crumbled into piles of rubble. The crystal sphere at the top had vanished, already taken by Ye Laomo.

Qi frowned deeply. He understood the situation perfectly but could think of no immediate solution. All they could do was hold their ground. Seeing that Qu Huan seemed to have an idea, he quickly asked, "Fellow Daoist Qu, do you have a plan?"

"Abandon the outer city!" Qu Huan declared resolutely. "In times of necessity, sacrifices must be made. If we wait until the outer city is breached, it will be too late to regroup. Fellow Daoist, you must decide quickly! The inner city is the original site of Yu City. Its protective formation was left by our ancestors and has stood the test of time. Even if the Two Realms Alliance throws everything they have at us, they won't be able to break through in a short time. We can hold out until Zhenren and the others return."

Qi's expression turned grave, and a struggle flickered in his eyes.

Abandoning the outer city was not just a matter of losing territory.

The outer city housed numerous treasuries, now filled with resources prepared for the war, all of which would fall into enemy hands.

There was also the city's defensive formation, which the Sin Abyss had spent vast resources to construct. Without the outer city as a barrier, they would have no retreat!

"Fellow Daoist Qu..."

After hesitating for a moment, Qi opened his mouth to speak, but suddenly, a sense of danger surged within him. A cold glint flashed, heading straight for his face.

A sharp pain pierced his brow.

"It's you!"

Qi's expression changed drastically. He roared and retreated, his body erupting with a brilliant green light.

Within the light, the phantom of a treasure armor appeared.

The armor was ancient and rugged, to put it bluntly, it looked old and worn, as if pieced together from patches of tree bark.

Despite its dilapidated appearance, the armor spun rapidly around Qi, its surface covered in countless glowing runes, exuding a dense, heavy green light.

*Clang!*

A thumb-sized, dark golden flying sword pierced through the green light and struck the armor, producing a metallic clang.

Seeing that the sword could not penetrate the armor, Qu Huan recalled it, a look of surprise flashing across his face. He had not expected Qi to so easily block his sneak attack.

"Shameless traitor! Have you forgotten the grace of your sect's nurturing? How could you betray the Sin Abyss and become a lackey of the Heaven's March Alliance?"

Qi was furious, unable to believe what was happening.

Qu Huan hailed from Haotian Mansion, a major orthodox sect of the Sin Abyss. His status was second only to the sect's Grand Elder, placing him above tens of thousands. His future was boundless, yet he was a traitor.

"Lackey? I was born into the Heaven's March Alliance. My time in Haotian Mansion was merely a pretense. In my youth, my talent was mediocre, and I received little attention. It was only through the Heaven's March Alliance's secret support and my own efforts that I achieved what I have today. Haotian Mansion was merely the icing on the cake; they truly owe me no gratitude..."

Qu Huan spoke without a trace of guilt, his tone calm.

"What? You were sent to Haotian Mansion by the Heaven's March Alliance?" Qi was stunned.

Both the Heaven's March Alliance and the Sin Abyss were well aware that there were spies within their ranks, but for a spy to achieve Qu Huan's level of success was exceedingly rare.

"Impossible! If you had been controlled by the Heaven's March Alliance all along, there's no way you could have hidden it until now!"

Qu Huan sneered, "Controlled? Zhenyi Laodao did try to use methods to control me, but I secretly broke free. Before today, even during the campaign against the Heaven's March Alliance, I never sent a single message to them or did anything to betray the Sin Abyss. Of course, you would never suspect me! Which side I lean toward depends entirely on my mood. Naturally, I would hedge my bets. With the situation as it is today, the outcome is clear, so I decided to take a gamble. I just didn't expect you, Fellow Daoist Qi, to be so capable. Even after being poisoned by my Formless Toxin, your true essence remains unaffected, and you can still block my Dust Dusk Sword. With these two methods, I once slew a shape-shifting great demon!"

Hearing this, Qi dropped all pretense and said coldly, "Did you really think your schemes were flawless, that everyone would dance to your tune? When you and Old Freak Feng volunteered to stay and assist me in defending the city, of course I had to be cautious. I was more wary of Old Freak Feng, suspecting he was putting on an act. I never imagined the traitor would be you!"
