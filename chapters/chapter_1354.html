<h1>Chapter 1346: Altar’s Change</h1><p>The demonic fire was about to be taken.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang showed no sign of panic.</p><p>Yu Gu paused, sensing something amiss, realizing he might have overlooked something!</p><p>The soul energy around the Soul Gathering Array swirled, forming a huge funnel-shaped dark cloud in mid-air, releasing a continuous stream of strange fluctuations that clearly affected the demonic fire.</p><p>Even the eighteen demonic banners were powerless against it.</p><p>Qin Sang could only watch helplessly as the demonic fire detached from the banners, speeding towards the Soul Gathering Array, ultimately falling under its control, completely changing hands!</p><p>Just at the critical moment.</p><p>A tiny flame suddenly leaped from the center of the demonic fire.</p><p>This flame was also demonic fire, seamlessly integrated.  Yu Gu wouldn't have noticed anything unusual if it hadn't appeared. Unlike the other demonic fire being drawn to the Soul Gathering Array, this flame, though seemingly weak, was incredibly stable, completely unaffected.</p><p>The flame rose, revealing a fire lotus seed!</p><p>The Fire Seed Golden Lotus!</p><p>From the beginning, Qin Sang had secretly hidden the fire lotus seed within the demonic fire, deliberately masking its fluctuations to deceive Yu Gu’s senses.</p><p>The fire lotus seed was formed from the demonic fire Qin Sang had refined.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The fire lotus seed scattered, transforming into a fiery blanket, covering the demonic fire and cutting off the Soul Gathering Array’s influence.</p><p>Qin Sang's control over the demonic fire returned. With a thought, the demonic fire’s momentum instantly stopped, then abruptly fell back, increasing its distance from the Soul Gathering Array.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to delay, rapidly changing hand seals, struggling with all his might against the Soul Gathering Array.</p><p>Seeing the fire lotus seed, Yu Gu’s expression changed instantly.  He could clearly sense that the fire lotus seed and Qin Sang shared an identical aura, their connection extremely close.</p><p>He had just confidently told Elder Ye that a Nascent Soul-stage cultivator couldn't refine demonic fire.</p><p>He was slapped in the face so quickly, it was unbelievable.</p><p>The *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique had refined the demonic fire, making it almost like a natal demonic fire, leaving a deep imprint of Qin Sang's essence. Even a descendant of the Nine Nether Clan couldn't take his fire lotus seed.</p><p>Yu Gu, enraged and humiliated, roared.</p><p>The Soul Gathering Array violently shook, its fluctuations drawing soul energy, transforming into streaks of black energy that shot downwards, directly towards the main body of the demonic fire.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly, immediately dispersing the fiery blanket, merging the fire lotus seed back into the main demonic fire.</p><p>*Pff! Pff!*</p><p>The streaks pierced the fire mass.</p><p>The demonic fire was about to fly towards the Soul Gathering Array again.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't allow this, activating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique, pulling with all his strength.</p><p>A tug-of-war ensued.</p><p>Yu Gu was also indirectly controlling it through the Soul Gathering Array, no different from the demonic banners.</p><p>Now, Yu Gu and Qin Sang's struggle for the demonic fire was far more difficult than seizing an unowned one.</p><p>Although only a portion had been refined by Qin Sang, the demonic fire was of the same origin. Through the fire lotus seed, Qin Sang had a degree of control, a concept completely different from indirect control via the banners—a qualitative change!</p><p>Yu Gu, at his former level, could certainly have done it.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had just escaped his seal, and his current cultivation was not yet worlds apart from Qin Sang’s.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Yu Gu and Qin Sang chased and fled, putting distance between themselves and the others.</p><p>Daoist Zhen and the others watched Qin Sang and Yu Gu’s struggle while rapidly approaching to support Qin Sang.</p><p>Those who made their move were all Nascent Soul masters, the pinnacle beings of Beichen Realm.</p><p>Each attack was formidable.</p><p>Years of warfare had honed their combined attack techniques; they were far from disorganized. Faced with the combined assault of several Nascent Soul cultivators, even a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator would have to retreat.</p><p>Yu Gu couldn't face them all head-on, yet their attacks found it difficult to approach him.</p><p>Without using any particular technique, Yu Gu's figure flickered, dodging all the magical treasures and spells, appearing completely unscathed.</p><p>Yu Gu ignored everyone else, coldly staring at Qin Sang, his eyes blazing with cold soul fire.</p><p>"You dare to defy me! I’ll end you today!"</p><p>His plan to seize the demonic fire failed.</p><p>If the struggle continued, Yu Gu would certainly win, but he lacked the patience for such games with Qin Sang. He made a decisive decision, abandoning the Soul Gathering Array.</p><p>Murder!</p><p>Plundering the fire!</p><p>"Why isn't Bai moving yet? I wonder if this little bit of time will be enough..."</p><p>Even at this moment, Qin Sang's mind was occupied with other thoughts.  He had done everything he could.  Unfortunately, Yu Gu was impetuous; if they had continued to stall, they could have bought more time.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, his expression taut. He stood still, his hand moving slightly, about to unleash the Binding Demon Rope. Yu Gu was closing in too fast; he couldn't hold back any longer.</p><p>Just then, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>A tremendous roar echoed from the distance, shaking the earth.</p><p>The ground trembled, the vibrations growing stronger.</p><p>The source seemed to be the direction of the Blood Altar.</p><p>Deep within the ghost mist, a bright green light was clearly visible.</p><p>Yu Gu's figure suddenly stopped, right in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>His head violently snapped towards the Blood Altar, Yu Gu stared intently, a horrifying roar escaping his throat.  His soul fire flared, almost bursting from his eyes!</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>His voice was like thunder.</p><p>Rage filled the air.</p><p>The next moment, Yu Gu abandoned the pursuit of Qin Sang, ignoring the demonic fire, transforming into a purple streak of light and vanishing instantly.</p><p>Zhen Yi Daochang and the others flew to Qin Sang's side, staring at the empty ghost mist, exchanging bewildered glances.</p><p>Yu Gu's appearance and disappearance were like a ghost, fleeting and untraceable.</p><p>"That's the demon sealed in the Abyss of Sin, right?  The demon Ye let loose, possessing Yu Gu.  Even after being sealed for countless years, he still possesses such terrifying power. What level of cultivation did he have back then?"</p><p>A young cultivator murmured, still shaken by what had just happened.</p><p>Even someone as powerful as Qin Sang, with his numerous treasures, was no match for Yu Gu. If they had been targeted, they would likely be corpses now.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, are you injured?"</p><p>Zhen Yi Daochang asked with concern. Seeing that Qin Sang was only slightly breathless and not seriously wounded, he turned his gaze towards the Eighteen Demon Banners. "What is the relationship between the demonic fire and Yu Gu?"</p><p>"There must be some connection."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, without elaborating. He summoned the banners back, checked them for damage, resealed the demonic fire, and said, "Let's go and see!"</p><p>With that, Qin Sang used his full遁术, speeding towards the Blood Altar. His eyes fixed on the green light above the altar, his gaze flickering, he tightened his grip on the Binding Demon Rope.</p><p>Zhen Yi Daochang and Cang Hong Zhenren quickly followed. They watched Qin Sang's back, a hint of suspicion flashing in their eyes. They felt that Qin Sang was acting strangely, as if he knew something.</p><p>The others hesitated for a moment before following suit.</p><p>Yu Gu's reaction didn't seem like an act; it appeared he had encountered some trouble.</p><p>He not only abandoned Qin Sang and the demonic fire, but also ignored the evil formation. The surrounding blood clouds dissipated, and the attack of the ghost creatures was no longer as ferocious as before.</p><p>The pressure on everyone lessened considerably, allowing them to break through the encirclement and head straight for the Blood Altar.
