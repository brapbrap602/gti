<h1>Chapter 841: A Surprising Discovery</h1><p>Leopard Demon and Crane Demon, along with other powerful demons and their followers, besieged the Commerce League cultivators.</p><p>The Commerce League cultivators were puzzled why so many powerful demons had targeted them.</p><p>They attempted to break through the encirclement, but the demons desperately blocked their escape, their ferocity chilling everyone to the bone.</p><p>Simultaneously, they discovered with horror that more demons seemed to be converging on their location.</p><p>Just as despair gripped the Commerce League cultivators, the Leopard Demon received a message from the Fish Demon, revealing the target's location.</p><p>"Lie Qin has found the person, uh…"</p><p>The Crane Demon's voice was filled with surprise.  "Lie Qin tried to stop him, but was severely injured and forced to self-destruct to escape. The target has broken through the encirclement. We must reinforce immediately! Does he have help?"</p><p>The Leopard Demon was first ecstatic, then his expression turned grave.  He roared angrily, "That useless thing! Why did he send the message so late? Go!"</p><p>An unexpected turn of events unfolded for the Commerce League cultivators.</p><p>They thought their fate was sealed, secretly discussing a final, desperate fight.  Then, without warning, the strongest demons were inexplicably drawn away, abandoning them.</p><p>The remaining demons were still powerful, but not as terrifying.</p><p>Though unsure of what had happened, the Commerce League cultivators immediately seized the rare opportunity.</p><p>Confirming that the powerful demons had truly left, they executed their escape plan.</p><p>Shortly after, the Leopard Demon and his followers arrived at the place where Qin Sang disappeared, employing every means at their disposal, but they couldn't find him.</p><p>Frustrated roars echoed through the demonic horde.</p><p>…</p><p>Unaware of the chaos he had caused, Qin Sang escaped the demonic tide. Using celestial navigation, he activated the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman, set a course, and embarked on his solitary escape.</p><p>He quickly left the demonic tide far behind.</p><p>Despite the fierce battle with the Fish Demon, he encountered little resistance afterwards, outpacing most others.</p><p>He sped onward, encountering no one.</p><p>Having manipulated the formation disk for so long, Qin Sang was already exhausted; now he felt even more fatigued.</p><p>But he wouldn't rest nearby.  After traveling a considerable distance, he summoned his two-headed… beast, and they took turns traveling day and night without stopping.</p><p>After leaving that sea area far behind, Qin Sang found a small island to rest and recuperate.</p><p>He built a cave beneath a large rock, concealed by a spirit formation.</p><p>Sitting in his cave, Qin Sang had recovered from his exhaustion but didn't leave immediately, planning to stay for a while longer.  He waited for his Star Conch to replenish its spiritual energy and restore its power before setting off again.</p><p>The Star Conch had saved him many times, and he didn't want to repeat the fate of its previous owner, whose insufficient refinement time had compromised its power.</p><p>Furthermore, having verified the effect of the Heavenly Demon Transformation, he felt more confident in venturing alone into the Demon Sea.</p><p>"Other cultivators who consumed the Demonic Pill also have demonic aura, but it's useless. The Heavenly Demon Transformation is truly extraordinary…"</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation, his spiritual sense repeatedly sweeping across his phoenix wings.</p><p>He stood up, condensed water into ice, and formed a mirror.</p><p>Who was the refined gentleman reflected in the mirror?</p><p>He looked like a jade-faced young man, but his eyes held a maturity and firmness that belied his appearance.  Behind him, his phoenix wings unfurled, radiating light, their azure brilliance resembling a phoenix descendant, giving him an otherworldly air.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't deliberately altered his appearance. Even when his foundation was damaged and his face looked old, he hadn't cared.  Later, after consuming the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit and the Three Lights Jade Liquid, his appearance had returned to its youthful state.</p><p>As the saying goes, the face reflects the heart. He was past the age of relying on his looks.</p><p>Years of cultivation and hardship had subtly changed his demeanor; even an ugly person would command attention.</p><p>"Thankfully, it's just some extra demonic aura. Otherwise, I wouldn't know what I'd become if I continued cultivating this technique. Heavenly Demon Transformation, demons can comprehend bloodline abilities, follow the path of their ancestors, and transform into Heavenly Demons. I used the Jade Buddha's power to forcibly open this path, even the Heavenly Demon I envisioned was a puppet illusion. It's probably a dead end. How far can I really go?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, a little uncertain.</p><p>Presumably, no other cultivator had ever cultivated this technique before, so it's impossible to learn from predecessors; he could only explore it on his own.</p><p>"One step at a time. At least it's going smoothly for now. As long as I can reach the third stage and open the sword path, that's enough. Before Yuan Ying, I should focus on the 'Chapter on Cultivating the Nascent Soul Sword'; I can't expect too much from the 'Heavenly Demon Transformation'…"</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, continuing to comprehend the Heavenly Demon Transformation while waiting for the Star Conch.</p><p>…</p><p>Months later.</p><p>A two-headed flying creature sped across the sea.</p><p>Qin Sang held a nautical chart.  "Last night's stargazing indicates we're near another large island, Milo Island.  Its island lord is also a Yuan Ying cultivator. He and the lord of Yu Heng Island had agreed to a mutual defense pact, but neither appeared during the beast tide.  I wonder what happened…"</p><p>Approaching Milo Island, Qin Sang paused, recalled the two-headed creature, and stealthily approached.</p><p>Upon seeing Milo Island, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically, and he retreated!</p><p>"The island is overrun with demonic beasts!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face was grave. A quick glance revealed Milo Island was filled with demonic energy, a haven for beasts; not a single cultivator was in sight.</p><p>"When did the beast tide conquer Milo Island?"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.  No wonder there was no reinforcement; Milo Island had also fallen.</p><p>The island's occupation by demonic beasts, with no visible battlefield, suggested either the island lord abandoned it, or suffered a devastating defeat.</p><p>The simultaneous fall of two Yuan Ying masters' domains was unprecedented.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a growing sense of foreboding.  It was likely more than just these two places were affected.</p><p>"No! I must return to Da Huang Island immediately. If the Demon Sea undergoes a major transformation and the teleportation array is sealed, I might not be able to return.  If a Heavenly Demon emerges, being trapped in the Demon Sea wouldn't be life-threatening. However, the Yuan Tai within my externalized body is about to mature, and I must personally nurture it. Also, the Mao Shan vine was sent back to Da Huang Island; as long as it hasn't been sent to the Inner Sea, there's a chance to retrieve it."</p><p>Qin Sang bypassed Milo Island and headed towards Da Huang Island along the established route.</p><p>This time, he and the two-headed creature traveled almost non-stop, unwilling to linger in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Soon, he reached a third island.  From afar, he saw demonic birds circling and playing joyfully in the sky.</p><p>"A third island, also occupied! This route is essentially severed!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart grew heavier.  Even more pressing was the complete lack of information about what had transpired.</p><p>He encountered other cultivators along the way—escapees from Yu Heng Island—equally clueless.  They did, however, share some details from the night of the breakout.</p><p>Qin Sang declined their offer to travel together, charting his own course to reach Da Huang Island as quickly as possible.  After all, there was nowhere safe in the Demon Sea.</p>
