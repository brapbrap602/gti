<h1>Chapter 663: Settlement</h1><p>Chapter 663: Settlement</p><p>Du Han had been stuck at a bottleneck for many years, all because of the demonic energy.</p><p>He had previously refined some spirit herbs to cleanse the demonic energy, with some effect.  Taking this Golden Barrier Grass would have allowed him to smoothly break through to the mid-stage of Core Formation, but unfortunately, he had no such chance.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the crystal, a jade box appearing in his palm.</p><p>Inside the jade box was a slender, glittering golden herb – the Golden Barrier Grass.</p><p>“I never imagined that some herbs of little value in Xiaohan Region would be such rare treasures here.  If I’d known, I would have brought more, I could have made a fortune!”</p><p>Qin Sang said with self-deprecation.</p><p>He had obtained Du Han's pouch, gaining a rich harvest, so he wasn't in a hurry to sell the Golden Barrier Grass. This kind of spirit herb was needed by all human Core Formation cultivators; it was best used for bartering to maximize its value.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang sorted and transferred the contents of Du Han's pouch into his own storage ring, then destroyed the pouch.</p><p>…</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>Qianhu Village.</p><p>The old shaman, whose body had always been exceptionally strong, still capable of personally collecting herbs and hunting wolves in the mountains at his age,  suddenly fell gravely ill and died within a single hour.</p><p>The shamans summoned from other villages hadn't arrived yet.</p><p>The old shaman was highly respected and held great prestige in Qianhu Village. The villagers were heartbroken, but could only grieve while making arrangements for his funeral.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, on the day of the old shaman's burial, it was the body of a strange old man that was interred. Simultaneously, a dark cloud silently rose from the green peak across from Qianhu Village and soared into the sky.</p><p>Within the cloud sat Qin Sang and the old shaman.</p><p>The old shaman remained silent, gazing silently at Qianhu Village, where he had lived for decades. Even as it disappeared from view, his gaze lingered, reluctant to let go.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang’s gaze, the old shaman retracted his eyes, wiping away tears, and said with self-deprecation, “Forgive my emotional display, Master. Though I am a solitary man, leaving Qianhu Village so suddenly leaves me strangely empty.  Things I once considered ordinary now feel like bonds I can't bear to sever, tugging at my heart…”</p><p>The old shaman’s face was filled with melancholy.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the old shaman's feelings.</p><p>The old shaman had saved him, so Qin Sang didn’t resort to force. Instead, under the guise of Ya Gu, he coaxed and persuaded the old shaman to leave.</p><p>The body in the grave was found elsewhere, and he used a method learned in the mortal realm to ensure rapid decomposition after burial.</p><p>This was a precaution, not strictly necessary.</p><p>That day, drifting in the river, caught amongst broken branches and dead wood, his body covered in grass and leaves, only Ya Gu and the old shaman had witnessed his near-death state.</p><p>Even if the Li Witch Palace investigated, without knowing the truth, there would be no reason to exhume a mortal's grave.</p><p>“Old man, rest assured. Ya Gu instructed me before her seclusion to settle you in a safe place, ensuring your prosperity for generations to come,” Qin Sang promised.</p><p>The old shaman chuckled bitterly, “I’ve endured hardship all my life; what’s the importance of riches and comfort?  But I never expected to be taken to the heavens by the Master before my death.  Only now do I understand the freedom of birds, and I feel my life has not been in vain.”</p><p>After a moment of reflection, the old shaman suddenly became nervous.  “Master, you didn't mention it before, but I didn't know the world of immortals was so dangerous. You only took me, will they threaten Ya Gu to get to you?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. “Ya Gu cares only for you. Besides, you know Ya Gu's personality; she wouldn’t recklessly stir up trouble.  Relocating you is purely a precaution.”</p><p>The old shaman breathed a sigh of relief. “As long as it doesn’t burden Ya Gu.  I am a dying man, I can do anything. I watched that child grow up, she’s suffered so much, she's so naive. I regret that I couldn’t protect her when she was chosen as the Saintess. Fortunately, Master, you came. It’s Ya Gu’s destiny, her hardship has led to this, becoming an immortal others dare not dream of. If she does anything inappropriate, Master, please bear with her for saving you. Otherwise, just send her back, I can live a few more years, and I can take care of her...”</p><p>“Ya Gu is doing very well, diligently cultivating.  Don't worry,”</p><p>Qin Sang said insincerely, then entered into deep meditation.</p><p>The old shaman secretly glanced at Qin Sang, sighing inwardly, not daring to disturb Qin Sang further.</p><p>What the old shaman hadn't anticipated was that this flight would never end.  The black cloud beneath them passed through mountains and ridges, revealing countless breathtaking sights he could never have imagined in his lifetime.</p><p>From initial novelty to eventual numbness.</p><p>The shaman's envoy beside him, aside from the occasional conversation, spent his time in meditation.</p><p>The old shaman finally understood the meaning of "austere training."</p><p>He'd lost count of the sunrises and sunsets. He noticed the mountains and rivers below were less treacherous, plains became more common, and he saw several magnificent cities he'd never seen before—a truly eye-opening experience.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, they were about to leave the Western Frontier.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, took out a map, and checked it.</p><p>With the old shaman in tow and needing to avoid other Golden Core cultivators entering the Western Frontier, Qin Sang took a circuitous route.  His flight wasn't fast, but he arrived at the edge of the Western Frontier without incident.</p><p>The map showed their current location was a small human kingdom under the control of the Li Wu Palace.</p><p>Heading directly east would lead them straight into Li Wu Palace territory.</p><p>After examining the map, Qin Sang immediately steered his cloud mount north, bypassing the Li Wu Palace's influence.</p><p>He didn't intend to leave the old shaman here. He was going to Pingbo Harbor, a port on the northern end of the Shaman Continent.</p><p>Pingbo Harbor was one of the most famous ports on the Shaman Continent, a hub for many large human merchant guilds. It provided easy access to human cultivators.</p><p>Pingbo Harbor was extremely prosperous, with intertwined powers, but being within Shaman territory, humans didn't dare be too ostentatious, all hoping to maintain the harbor's stability.</p><p>The Li Wu Palace's reach didn't extend to Pingbo Harbor.  Settling the old shaman there in a human kingdom for a peaceful retirement was ideal.</p><p>After leaving the Western Frontier, the population density noticeably increased.</p><p>Qin Sang maintained a low profile to avoid encountering Shaman Golden Core cultivators, even going so far as to disguise himself as a commoner and hire a carriage.  With his protection, the old shaman, despite his age, felt no hardship.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the old shaman was growing suspicious about being taken so far, but he didn't mind.  After settling him, he would definitely seal his memories, especially those concerning his lost arm.</p><p>This matter was of great importance and couldn't be treated lightly.</p><p>An unremarkable carriage sped along the road. Suddenly, the curtain was lifted. Qin Sang gazed south, towards the Li Wu Palace's mountain gate, his expression indifferent.</p><p>Finally, he collected his thoughts and began considering his next steps in Pingbo Harbor.</p>
