<h1>Chapter 768: Snatching Food from the Tiger's Mouth</h1><p>"Ha..."</p><p>The pack of beasts bared their fangs, their purple eyes widened, and their ferocious aura surged as they growled warnings.  They seemed surprised that other monsters dared to compete with them for the Violet Crystals. Even their leader appeared stunned, momentarily unable to react.</p><p>After all, in this territory, only their own kind dared to consume the Violet Crystals.</p><p>But upon seeing the Two-Headed Vulture swoop down and swallow a Violet Crystal whole, the beasts erupted in fury.</p><p>Their leader roared, and the entire pack went berserk.  Their fleshy wings connected, blotting out the sky. Waves of violet fire formed a sea of flames, instantly engulfing two of the vulture's illusory doubles.</p><p>The Two-Headed Vulture unleashed a windstorm attack before turning tail and fleeing, narrowly avoiding being scorched by the violet fire.</p><p>Just then, a streak of escaping light shot out from a crevice in the stone, its speed astonishing. In the blink of an eye, it reached the center of the small lake.</p><p>Most of the beasts were pursuing the Two-Headed Vulture, leaving only their leader guarding the lake's center, waiting to seize the emerging Violet Crystal.</p><p>Qin Sang's sudden appearance caught the leader off guard.</p><p>It opened its massive maw and spewed violet fire.</p><p>However, before the fire could reach Qin Sang, it was scattered by the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire was undoubtedly far more potent than the beast leader's flames, but due to Qin Sang's limited cultivation, the demon fire, after dispersing the violet fire, was also nearing exhaustion, on the verge of extinguishing.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to urge the Ten Yama Banners to attack and force the beast leader back.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon seeing the Nine Nether Demon Fire, the leader recoiled as if it had seen a ghost. Its face contorted in terror, its cries distorted, and it instinctively retreated.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished. He hadn't anticipated this reaction. The leader's fear of the Nine Nether Demon Fire was so profound that its first instinct was to flee.</p><p>Although puzzled, this situation was clearly advantageous.</p><p>In the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone, once these beasts went berserk, they wouldn't give up until death.  Qin Sang had initially assumed forcing the leader back would require considerable effort.</p><p>Presented with such a golden opportunity, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't let it slip. He immediately abandoned the pursuit of the beast leader. His figure flashed, bypassing the creature, and darted towards the swirling vortex at the lake's center.</p><p>At this moment, the Violet Crystal within the vortex rose higher and higher. Two more cracks appeared on its surface before it shattered into three pieces, rapidly ascending.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared above the vortex, True Essence surging in his palm, transforming into a large hand that reached for the nearest fragment.</p><p>The True Essence hand withstood the vortex's impact and successfully grasped the Violet Crystal.</p><p>At that instant, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically.</p><p>The moment his True Essence touched the Violet Crystal, a rich purple energy surged from it, infiltrating his True Essence. In the blink of an eye, his True Essence was completely dyed purple.</p><p>Furthermore, the purple energy rapidly spread upwards, following the connection of his True Essence, directly towards his physical body.</p><p>"What a potent poison! More terrifying than the Violet Mist, capable of even infecting True Essence!"</p><p>Qin Sang was alarmed. He finally understood why the beasts inhabiting the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone were so wary of the Violet Crystals, only daring to consume tiny fragments at a time.</p><p>He hadn't expected such a complication while retrieving the Violet Crystal.</p><p>He certainly didn't want this potent poison to invade his body.</p><p>For a moment, Qin Sang couldn't think of a suitable countermeasure.</p><p>Left with no choice, he could only abandon the attempt and sever the connection with that strand of True Essence.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, inwardly cursing the troublesome situation.</p><p>If he waited for the Violet Crystals to emerge from the vortex on their own, most of them would dissipate into the Violet Mist.</p><p>He knew few restrictive spells that targeted poisons, and faced with such a potent toxin, ordinary restrictions wouldn't be able to suppress the Violet Crystals.</p><p>The only thing he possessed that was clearly more powerful than the Violet Crystals was the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>While subduing the Cold Flame, he had created several sealing restrictions that could utilize the power of the Nine Nether Demon Fire. He wondered if they would be effective against the Violet Crystals.</p><p>Just then, the sound of something cutting through the air came from behind.</p><p>Qin Sang's back tensed as he felt the approaching wind.</p><p>The leader had recovered.</p><p>Simultaneously, the beasts that had been pursuing the Two-Headed Vulture, enraged beyond measure, were also returning, leaving him with little time.</p><p>Without turning back, Qin Sang unleashed a burst of Nine Nether Demon Fire behind him.</p><p>As expected, the leader, terrified of the Nine Nether Demon Fire, didn't dare to collide with it. With a howl, it twisted its body and swiftly dodged.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze flickered as he fixed his eyes on the swirling Violet Crystals. Just as he was about to make another attempt, he noticed Fatty Silkworm rearing up, its mouth open, spitting out incredibly condensed strands of seven-colored light towards the Violet Crystal.</p><p>"How could I forget about it!  The Violet Crystal is what this little guy specifically wanted to eat.  Quite clever of it to lend a hand."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly. It wasn't that he had overlooked Fatty Silkworm's abilities, but rather that Fatty Silkworm wasn't his natal insect, so communication took time, which he clearly lacked in this situation.</p><p>The strands of light swiftly landed on the Violet Crystal, rapidly wrapping around it, quickly forming a thin, seven-colored cocoon.</p><p>Qin Sang's True Essence then descended. With the seven-colored cocoon acting as a barrier, the potent poison didn't spread.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Qin Sang retrieved the cocoon into a jade box in his palm.</p><p>This Violet Crystal was the size of a fist, yet in his hand, it was as light as a feather, without any weight.</p><p>He was curious about how these Violet Crystals formed, but unfortunately, the vortex was incredibly deep, and he couldn't see the bottom.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the lake's center, quickly storing the jade box within the Qianjun Ring, and then looked at Fatty Silkworm.</p><p>After expelling the seven-colored silk threads, Fatty Silkworm's aura suddenly weakened.  Clearly, producing these highly condensed threads consumed more energy than the seven-colored halo.</p><p>Yet, Fatty Silkworm persevered, continuing to spit silk threads towards the largest remaining Violet Crystal, determined to secure its delicacy.</p><p>At this moment, the entire beast pack went completely mad.</p><p>They had watched Qin Sang take a large Violet Crystal, stealing their clan's treasure. How could they not be enraged?</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang dare to claim another Violet Crystal, all the beasts went into a frenzy.</p><p>Using the Nine Nether Demon Fire to repel them was no longer feasible.</p><p>The leader let out an earth-shattering roar that echoed through the rift valley.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He sensed something odd about the leader's roar, as if it were calling for something.</p><p>Soon, his suspicions were confirmed.</p><p>A responding roar came from the depths of the rift valley, booming like muffled thunder. Hearing this sound, Qin Sang felt a tightness in his chest, his blood boiling.</p><p>"There's an even stronger leader hidden in the depths of the rift valley!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face paled. He sensed agitation in the depths of the rift valley, a powerful force rushing towards them.</p><p>He didn't dare hesitate.  Quickly scooping up the Violet Crystal bound by the seven-colored silk threads, he turned, unleashing a sword strike.  The surging sword energy blocked the beast leader's claws, opening a path.</p><p>The rest of the pack had arrived, overwhelming in number.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. He then abruptly struck the center of the vortex with his palm.</p><p>The last remaining Violet Crystal, impacted by the force, instantly shattered into countless glittering fragments that shot out like fireworks, scattering everywhere.</p><p>As the Violet Mist swirled, some of the fragments vanished.</p><p>The beasts, nearly driven to madness, saw this and their eyes turned bloodshot. They changed their target, scrambling for the Violet Crystal fragments.</p><p>The pressure on Qin Sang immediately lessened, but he felt no relief.  He charged out of the encirclement with all his might, retrieving the waiting Two-Headed Vulture with the Twin Heart Ring and fleeing at top speed.</p>
