<h1>First Thousand Four Hundred Eighty-Eighth Chapter Aged and Decrepit </h1><p>‘Hua!’</p><p>Two streams of light tore through the overcast clouds.</p><p>One was golden, a miniature Garuda formed from golden light, lifelike, with sharp beak and claws, its feathers like golden iron, exceedingly fierce.</p><p>The other was black, the Chaos Demon Token.</p><p>The golden Garuda and the Chaos Demon Token were evenly matched, simultaneously breaking through the overcast clouds.</p><p>Qin Sang was too familiar with the Chaos Demon Token.</p><p>The moment he saw this magical artifact, Qin Sang's pupils constricted, and he understood many things.</p><p>The Chaos Demon Old Man's purpose in inviting him was the Xuan Tian Palace Holy Land!</p><p>No wonder the Chaos Demon Old Man widely invited experts, proactively resolving grudges; it wasn't that the place he was going to was so dangerous, but rather that the Xuan Tian Palace's strength was too great.</p><p>He had to find another Great Cultivator-level expert to have the strength to contend.</p><p>Qin Sang had a feud with the Xuan Tian Palace, making him the perfect candidate.</p><p>Qin Sang mused that if he hadn't been persuaded by Liu Li with the condition of the Cleansing Body Pond and ignored the Chaos Demon Old Man's invitation, he could now be a double agent.</p><p>That golden Garuda must be the Great Sage Heavenly Peng's divine ability.</p><p>Now it seemed that the Demon Clan's sudden attack earlier was also intentional.</p><p>These thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The next moment, the Chaos Demon Token and the golden Garuda's light dimmed, and a狂 laugh resounded from within the overcast clouds as two figures burst into the Holy Land. Streams of light followed them, emerging one after another.</p><p>"Chaos Demon Old Man!"</p><p>"Great Sage Heavenly Peng!"</p><p>"Blood Demon King!"</p><p>"General Gui!"</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing these faces, the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators exclaimed in shock.</p><p>All were famous Great Demons and Demon Lords.</p><p>At this time, how could they not understand that the war a month ago had been calculated by the other side, leading to the sect leaving many experts to guard Demon Subduing Island.</p><p>Comparing the two sides.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace had actually fallen into a disadvantage, becoming the weaker side.</p><p>Undercurrents surged in the void.</p><p>The Chaos Demon Old Man's side also saw the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators.</p><p>The two sides stared at each other across the void, their expressions varying.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liu Li stood together, silently pondering.</p><p>With the situation as it was, Qin Sang couldn't tell whether it was good or bad.</p><p>Just now, he had probed indirectly and discovered that Palace Lord Jiang and Liu Li knew very little about the depths of the Holy Land, and that unknown secrets were hidden within.</p><p>The unexpected appearance of the Chaos Demon Old Man and the Great Sage Heavenly Peng, disrupting the situation, might be an opportunity for him to seize the Shattered Sword Fragment, but it was also possible that two powerful opponents had emerged.</p><p>For now, he could only take things one step at a time.</p><p>Qin Sang weighed the pros and cons, and a plan formed in his mind.</p><p>In any case, he had to get the qualification for the Cleansing Body Pond first, and then act according to the situation.</p><p>For Qin Sang, the Shattered Sword Fragment was not an urgent matter.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, the cultivation technique stored with the fragment must be the part after the Transformation Stage, which he certainly wouldn't be able to use for hundreds of years.</p><p>The greatest use of the Shattered Sword Fragment was to help the Sword Spirit recover.</p><p>However, the Sword Spirit's recovery speed was too slow, so there was no need to rush.</p><p>Therefore.</p><p>Qin Sang understood very clearly that whether the Shattered Sword Fragment continued to be stored in the Holy Land or fell into the hands of the Chaos Demon Old Man and others, it wouldn't matter much.</p><p>They couldn't possibly destroy the Shattered Sword Fragment, nor could they cultivate the *'Primal Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter'*. He would just treat it as them keeping it safe for him.</p><p>Having found this Shattered Sword Fragment that had fallen into the North Sea, Qin Sang's purpose had been achieved.</p><p>He could lock onto the location of the Shattered Sword Fragment through the Sword Spirit, so others couldn't hide it.</p><p>Qin Sang had plenty of patience.</p><p>When he had enough strength, he would come and retrieve the treasure!</p><p>The opportunity to improve his talent was only this once, a great opportunity that would benefit him for life, so he couldn't miss it.</p><p>Of course, if there was an opportunity to seize the Shattered Sword Fragment, he would definitely go all out, to avoid accidents with the cultivation technique, and he also had the strength to participate in the competition!</p><p>Having figured this out, Qin Sang immediately became much more at ease.</p><p>He took a deep look at the Chaos Demon Old Man and the Great Sage Heavenly Peng, his gaze sweeping over the group of demons behind them, and a look of surprise flashed when he saw two of them.</p><p>They were an old man and a young man.</p><p>The two stood not far behind the Chaos Demon Old Man.</p><p>The old man had a full head of white hair and was aged and decrepit , but between his brows, one could still see a few traces of his youth. A flash of精芒 occasionally appeared in his turbid eyes, making people afraid to underestimate him.</p><p>The young man was a handsome youth, refined in appearance, a modest gentleman. Even strangers would feel a sense of goodwill upon seeing him.</p><p>A strange look appeared in Qin Sang's eyes. This young man was actually the long-separated Qiu Mubai, Senior Brother Qiu.</p><p>The only disciple that Dongyang Bo took away when he left Shaohua Mountain!</p><p>His current cultivation was already at the peak of the late Golden Core stage, on par with Tan Hao.</p><p>However, Tan Hao had received guidance from the Ghost Mother, and also obtained spirit medicine and listened to the morning bell and evening drum at the Pure Sea Sect. With so many opportunities, breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage was only a matter of time.</p><p>"Could that old man be…"</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the old man, and his heart trembled.</p><p>"It really is him!"</p><p>The old man was actually Dongyang Bo!</p><p>The last time Qin Sang saw Dongyang Bo was when the Northern Chen Alliance was established, not long after the Ziwei Palace ascended.</p><p>At that time, Dongyang Bo's appearance hadn't changed much from before. He was still wearing brocade robes, possessing the demeanor of a mid-Nascent Soul stage cultivator and the master of a sect.</p><p>But in just a few decades, Dongyang Bo had become so old, carrying a deep air of decay, almost unrecognizable.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered what Liu Li had said earlier.</p><p>Bing Yao had passed on a secret technique to Dongyang Bo, allowing him to break through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, but the essence energy in his body would decay faster, and even if he managed to hold on until the next Heavenly Tribulation descended, he would surely die.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had obviously not found a solution, and the hidden danger had begun to erupt. He wasn't dead yet, but his appearance was already so old, no different from a decrepit old man among mortals.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Liu Li's gaze and turned to look at her.</p><p>"He is already nearing the end of his life,"</p><p>Liu Li also recognized Dongyang Bo, transmitting her voice.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He couldn't say what he was feeling in his heart.</p><p>Seeing his enemy about to die, he certainly felt satisfaction, but seeing the Shaohua Mountain Ancestor, whom he had once feared so much, heading towards his demise, he couldn't help but feel a sense of *'a rabbit dying, the fox grieves'*. </p><p>If he stopped progressing, he would eventually face such a day!</p><p>After coming to the North Sea, Qin Sang hadn't found any trace of Dongyang Bo, and had thought that his previous deduction was wrong. He hadn't expected to meet him again here.</p><p>At this time, Dongyang Bo also saw Liu Li in the Xuan Tian Palace crowd.</p><p>No one else, Liu Li was too eye-catching, even wearing a veil.</p><p>Finding that Liu Li was still trapped in the early Nascent Soul stage, Dongyang Bo wasn't surprised at all.</p><p>The origin of the *'Profound Female Jade Cauldron True Scripture'* was not simple. It was an existence that could be enshrined by the Demonic Sect, so how could the hidden dangers of evil cultivation be so easily resolved?</p><p>As the instigator, he didn't have a good solution either.</p><p>This was also one of the reasons why he had been avoiding seeing Liu Li.</p><p>At this time, Dongyang Bo noticed the unfamiliar man beside Liu Li.</p><p>The distance between the two was a little too close.</p><p>Without resolving the hidden dangers of evil cultivation, Liu Li shouldn't have been able to form a Daoist partnership with another person.</p><p>A trace of strangeness flashed in Dongyang Bo's eyes. Although Qin Sang had changed his appearance, Dongyang Bo had studied Qin Sang for a long time after suffering a loss, and was too familiar with him.</p><p>…</p><p>The two sides confronted each other across the void.</p><p>Within the Holy Land, there was only the sound of the overcast clouds moving.</p><p>The Chaos Demon Old Man and the Great Sage Heavenly Peng's gazes fell on the Divine Bird Treasure Carriage, somewhat uncertain.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace Master had really come out of seclusion.</p><p>They exchanged glances and no longer hesitated, immediately driving their escape lights and leading their team into the Holy Land, not wanting to fight the Xuan Tian Palace head-on.</p><p>Tong Lingyu coldly swept her gaze over the group of demons, without the slightest hint of panic, flashed to the side of the Treasure Carriage, and whispered a few words.</p><p>After silently communicating with the Palace Master for a while, Tong Lingyu slightly nodded, turned to look at everyone, and said in a calm tone: "Everyone, please don't be restless, there's no need to worry, the Chaos Demon Old Man and the Great Sage Heavenly Peng will be taken care of by the Palace Master and this Palace! The Can Shen Pearl and other most important treasures must not be lost, Palace Lords and Elders, please take the treasures in pairs and quickly rendezvous with us, remember to act cautiously…"</p><p>Tong Lingyu was methodical, making various arrangements.</p><p>It was clear that on the basis of guarding against demons, the goal was still to obtain treasures as the main priority.</p><p>Hearing these arrangements, there was a commotion in the crowd. Some people didn't understand why they wouldn't directly start a war, driving the demons out of the Holy Land, but instead let them run rampant.</p><p>They worried that doing so would allow the demons to defeat them one by one.</p><p>The Palace Master's cultivation was the best in the North Sea, and together with the Great Elder wielding the spiritual treasure, they would surely be invincible.</p><p>Although the demons had the upper hand, it wasn't a decisive advantage. They were a rabble, and would guard against each other, while the Xuan Tian Palace was united and their hearts were available for use.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly praised her wisdom.</p><p>Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu's minds were very clear.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace was wary of the demons, but how could the other side not be wary of them?</p><p>This group of demons had come to seek opportunities, not as subordinates of the Chaos Demon Old Man, and didn't want to form a deadly feud with the Xuan Tian Palace unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>With the Chaos Demon Old Man and the Great Sage Heavenly Peng present, it was impossible for the Xuan Tian Palace to kill them all, and would only increase casualties for nothing.</p><p>The Holy Land's exposure was a foregone conclusion.</p><p>They might as well go back and think about countermeasures later.</p><p>For now, taking treasures was the top priority. The Xuan Tian Palace knew the Holy Land best, and no matter how lucky those demons were, they could only snatch a very small portion.</p><p>Hiding the location of the Holy Land before was to avoid attracting trouble.</p><p>Now that the location was exposed, the Xuan Tian Palace might not be afraid.</p><p>The key to the Holy Land was still in the hands of the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace could decide when to open the Holy Land, and then strictly keep the opening time secret. Unless these people did nothing and guarded nearby every day.</p><p>As the number one sect in the North Sea, the Xuan Tian Palace had enough confidence to dominate the Holy Land!</p><p>Having figured this out, Tong Lingyu and the Palace Master quickly made a decision.</p><p>Taking treasures in the Holy Land was up to each individual's ability!</p><p>The Nascent Souls also knew the stakes, acted according to orders, and the Xuan Tian Palace moved up and down, entering the Holy Land.</p><p>This arrangement was just what Qin Sang wanted. He immediately transmitted his voice to Liu Li, and the two of them immediately drove their escape lights and flew towards the floating mountain where the Cleansing Body Pond was located.</p><p>The two were about to leave.</p><p>A faint voice transmission, like murmuring, suddenly came to Qin Sang's ear, "After the Daoist Priest leaves the Cleansing Body Pond, I hope you can come to the last floating mountain to meet with me, I have important matters to discuss, and I will definitely not disappoint the Daoist Priest…"</p><p>This was Tong Lingyu's voice.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's eyes flashed with精光, and his figure paused slightly.</p><p>There really were secrets deep within the Holy Land!</p><p>Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu were worried that they would be plotted against by the Chaos Demon Old Man and the Great Sage Heavenly Peng.</p><p>Within the Holy Land, only he was qualified to participate in the Great Cultivator battle.</p><p>This was exactly the opportunity Qin Sang had been seeking.</p><p>He nodded almost imperceptibly and left with Liu Li, heading away.</p><p>The situation was unpredictable, and the opening time of the Cleansing Body Pond was very short, so they didn't have time to pay attention to Dongyang Bo.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Dongyang Bo silently watched Liu Li and Qin Sang's movements.</p><p>He couldn't be completely sure that this person was Qin Sang.</p><p>Discovering that this person's cultivation was actually at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, Dongyang Bo's heart shook greatly, unbelievable, and he didn't reveal it on the outside only with his strong concentration.</p><p>You must know that less than a hundred years had passed since Qin Sang formed his Nascent Soul!</p><p>How was that possible!</p><p>Was this guy really a five-elemental root?</p><p>Did the person who tested his talent back then mismeasure?</p><p>Dongyang Bo fell into deep suspicion, but it was already too late to regret it.</p><p>He took Qiu Mubai, always following the strongest force led by the Chaos Demon Old Man and the Great Sage Heavenly Peng, and when he saw Liu Li and Qin Sang gradually moving away, his expression eased slightly.</p><p>"Master, where are we going now?"</p><p>Qiu Mubai was protected by Dongyang Bo with the Vajra Cutter.</p><p>Dongyang Bo did it deliberately, the Vajra Cutter emitting white light to block Qiu Mubai's line of sight, causing his vision to be blurred, and he didn't see Liu Li and Qin Sang.</p><p>Qiu Mubai couldn't see the outside situation clearly, and felt a little uneasy in his heart, couldn't help but speak out to ask.</p><p>Dongyang Bo glanced at the direction where Qin Sang and Liu Li disappeared, withdrew the Vajra Cutter, quietly changed direction, and said in a low voice: "Go to the Ice Wind Cave first!"</p><p>It was said that a late Golden Core stage cultivator could improve the chance of successfully forming a Nascent Soul by taking a trip to the Ice Wind Cave.</p><p>Qiu Mubai was facing this difficulty.</p><p>For decades, the two of them, master and disciple, had traveled around, and had obtained some opportunities, but the effect was not far from the Ice Wind Cave.</p><p>Qiu Mubai revealed an excited expression.</p><p>At this time, seeing Dongyang Bo's old face, Qiu Mubai suddenly remembered his master's state, and his heart ached, fearing to delay his master's time, and hurriedly said: "Master, disciple will go to compete for the qualification of the Ice Wind Cave myself, you are not with General Gui…"</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, he was interrupted by Dongyang Bo.</p><p>"Do you think you only need to compete with cultivators of the same rank? So many demon clans and demonic cultivators have entered the Holy Land, how can the Xuan Tian Palace not send experts to escort them, don't be noisy again!"</p><p>Qiu Mubai didn't dare to argue, and a resolute look appeared on his face.</p><p>The two, master and disciple, separated from the Chaos Demon Old Man.</p><p>There were several others who made the same choice as them, meeting halfway, deciding to join forces, and headed straight for the floating mountain where the Ice Wind Cave was located.</p><p>…</p><p>The floating mountains seen at the entrance were as small as stones.</p><p>Only when getting closer did they discover that each floating mountain was extremely huge.</p><p>One could imagine how vast the space of the Holy Land was.</p><p>So many people scattered into the Holy Land, but it didn't bring any change, it was still so empty and vast.</p><p>Qin Sang was in front, Liu Li was behind.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly could always easily find the gaps between the ancient restrictions and turbulence.</p><p>With the help of the Celestial Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang always maintained an extremely fast escape speed, flying and maneuvering, which looked extremely dangerous to outsiders, but he always turned danger into safety.</p><p>Liu Li didn't need to worry, just follow Qin Sang closely.</p><p>Passing floating mountain after floating mountain.</p><p>The Cleansing Body Pond was getting closer and closer.</p><p>The road they chose was slightly remote, and they could only see faint streams of light in the darkness far away.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced behind him, and thought that except for a few like the Chaos Demon Old Man, no one should be faster than them, and said: "Let's go to Gluttonous Lake first."</p><p>Liu Li nodded.</p><p>Gluttonous Lake and the Cleansing Body Pond were on the same floating mountain, located at both ends of the floating mountain respectively. There was an ancient restriction outside Gluttonous Lake, one of which was very strong, and Qin Sang and she had to join forces to break the restriction, but it wouldn't take too long.</p><p>The two were silent, flying silently.</p><p>They didn't encounter any obstacles on the way, and no one had the stupidity to intercept them.</p><p>Finally, the floating mountain was in sight.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>The epidemic has been repeated, and I haven't been home for a long time.</p><p>Tomorrow is the festival, and my parents are coming to see me from thousands of miles away, so I will spend some time with them and rest for a day.</p><p>I wish you all a happy festival and family reunion!</p>
