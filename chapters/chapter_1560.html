<h1>Chapter 1551: The Southern Red Island Chain</h1><p>Having traversed the Canglang Sea and the North Sea,</p><p>Qin Sang was no stranger to the ocean.</p><p>Returning to the sea, she felt a strange sense of ease; the mainland held too many constraints.</p><p>“Whoosh…”</p><p>Waves splashed.</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts were drawn back. She closed the window, sat cross-legged, and entered a meditative state.</p><p>Several times during the journey, the ship docked, and the crew knocked on her door, inviting her ashore for supplies, sightseeing, or trading for rare terrestrial spiritual materials and herbs, but Qin Sang declined each time.</p><p>This trading company had been in business for a long time, expertly managing various aspects of the journey.  They encountered no bandits or pirates, arriving smoothly at their destination: Farewell Island.</p><p>This island lay near the edge of the inner sea. For human cultivators, the area inside Farewell Island was relatively safe. Beyond Farewell Island, however, lay the outer sea—a place of extreme danger, where life and death hung in the balance, a fate reflected in the island's name.</p><p>However, even the most intimidating name couldn't deter cultivators’ thirst for treasure.</p><p>Cultivators who obtained treasures in the outer sea would sell them on Farewell Island, exchanging them for what they needed.  Farewell Island gradually became one of the largest trading centers in the East Sea, its commerce thriving.  The trading company that owned the dragon ship primarily aimed to procure goods on Farewell Island, using the sea voyage as secondary business.</p><p>“Safe travels, sir.”</p><p>The ship's manager waited at the dock. Seeing Qin Sang disembark, he smiled broadly, handing her a scroll.  “There are unscrupulous thieves on the island. Be careful not to be deceived. This scroll lists reputable merchants; our Shanhai Trading Company vouches for them.”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the scroll and thanked him.</p><p>The manager chuckled.</p><p>For some reason, even though this young scholar hadn't displayed any extraordinary abilities, the manager felt oddly inferior in his presence.</p><p>It wasn't a suppression of cultivation; the scholar seemed to possess an innate noble aura.</p><p>The manager, a seasoned traveler who had seen much of the world, trusted his intuition and knew that politeness was always appreciated. Building rapport was never a bad thing, and even if he misjudged, there would be no loss.</p><p>Soon, the manager rejoiced at his own good judgment.</p><p>Qin Sang walked through the crowd and went straight to a man and a woman waiting outside the dock.</p><p>On Farewell Island, where many cultivators gathered, the appearance and demeanor of individuals couldn't be overlooked.</p><p>“The woman is at the late Foundation Establishment stage, and the man is even stronger!”</p><p>The manager was startled, especially after seeing the couple's respectful demeanor towards the young scholar. Only then did he realize he had greatly underestimated the scholar.</p><p>Appearances truly could be deceiving!  What old monster was playing amongst mortals?!</p><p>They were Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu, husband and wife.</p><p>After Ruan Yu's illness was cured, they confessed their feelings and asked Qin Sang to officiate their wedding.</p><p>Years ago, the Zhou and Ruan couple had set out to the East Sea to scout ahead, following Qin Sang’s instructions.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Qin.”</p><p>Zhou and Ruan stepped forward to pay their respects, but Qin Sang stopped them.</p><p>They were the only two who knew that Qin Sang and Qingfeng Daoist were one and the same, though they couldn't fully comprehend it, only speculating that Qingfeng Daoist might be an incarnation of Qin Sang.</p><p>“Excellent.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the couple with approval.</p><p>They were inherently talented individuals, carefully selected by the previous head of the Loutai Pavilion.</p><p>When they left, Zhou Jin was at the early Golden Core stage. Now, he had advanced to the middle Golden Core stage. Ruan Yu had reached the False Core realm, only a step away from the Golden Core stage.</p><p>However, this hurdle wasn't easy to overcome.</p><p>On the way back to the inn, Zhou and Ruan seized the opportunity to ask Qin Sang for guidance, and she answered all their questions. After receiving her instruction, the couple was overjoyed with their gains.</p><p>As they spoke, the three entered the inn.</p><p>They activated a sealing restriction.</p><p>Zhou Jin put away his smile and spoke seriously. “Senior Qin, we came to the East Sea, following your instructions, to search for the legendary Transcendence stage cultivator. We discovered that many cultivators of unknown origin have also appeared in the East Sea with similar intentions.  We attempted to make contact with some of them but haven't found any accurate information.”</p><p>Ruan Yu continued, “We tried to trace the origin of the legend. The place where a Transcendence stage cultivator appeared couldn't have been the inner sea.  Those who witnessed it firsthand must have been cultivators who sought treasure in the outer sea; at minimum, they must have been at the Foundation Establishment stage. If there were Golden Core cultivators present, they probably wouldn’t have died of old age. But after years of searching, we still haven't found any eyewitnesses. The information is chaotic, and we can't even pinpoint the island where the rumors first spread.  Those who venture out to sea to seek treasure face constant danger; eyewitnesses may have already perished in accidents.”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised.  Two hundred years had passed; tracing the source was extremely difficult. Moreover, she knew that many unseen forces were likely stirring the waters, muddying the situation.</p><p>Another possibility had to be considered: the eyewitnesses might be under the control of some powerful force.</p><p>Besides finding people, Qin Sang also asked Zhou and Ruan to keep an eye out for other information.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that after the Ziwei Palace ascended, a deep pit remained on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, filled with terrifying ancient forbidden storms and spatial rifts.</p><p>The Abyssal Ruins and the Boundless Valley were also affected and became forbidden zones.</p><p>The Abyssal Ruins were impassable; Grandmaster Cang Hong had unfortunately perished within.</p><p>Assuming the celestial palaces of Tian Tong and Tian Xiang are also affected by the Purple Micro Palace, similar strange phenomena might occur.</p><p>Zhou Jin shook his head, "My junior sister and I have been to sea several times, and we haven't found such a place. However, there's a recent rumor that someone has found records indicating the existence of a very powerful ancient immortal sect in the East Sea.  In ancient times, the East Sea was plagued by rampaging demonic beasts, and the ancient immortal sect was destroyed in a monstrous tide of beasts. Legend says that if one finds the ruins of the ancient immortal sect, they can obtain top-tier inheritances. It's likely that the Nascent Soul cultivator has obtained some clues and is heading for the ancient immortal sect. The rumor is quite credible, and many people have already been drawn there..."</p><p>The situation in Central State doesn't seem to have always been so stable; peace is hard-won.</p><p>Qin Sang thoughtfully pressed, "Has anyone discovered anything?"</p><p>"Not yet."</p><p>While speaking, Ruan Yu mobilized her true essence, conjuring a sea chart out of thin air.  It basically included the locations of the most famous islands in the East Sea.  She pointed to an island chain further south.</p><p>"This is called the Chi Nan island chain; many cultivators are already gathering there."</p><p>The reason for sending a message back to the mountain and asking Qin Sang to go personally is because increasingly powerful cultivators are gathering in the Chi Nan island chain. With Zhou Jin and the others' cultivation levels, they can't do much. Even if they find something, they won't be able to contact Qin Sang in time, thus missing a good opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't expect that investigating the Nascent Soul cultivator's whereabouts and the two celestial palaces would also involve an ancient immortal sect.</p><p>If Hui Guang Saint and Dan Yu True Monarch are really trapped in the ruins of the ancient immortal sect, wouldn't it be tantamount to suicide for them, as Yuan Ying cultivators, to go there?</p><p>Breaking through to the late Yuan Ying stage is almost a sure thing. There's no need to take risks during this time.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped the table lightly, pondering for a moment before deciding to go and see what happens, acting according to the circumstances.</p><p>The decision was made.</p><p>The three of them rested briefly on Bie Li Island, gathered some information, and then set off for the Chi Nan island chain.</p><p>Instead of renting a ship, Qin Sang directly summoned a flying artifact, carrying the two of them, and flew through the air.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Posting two thousand words first, more to come later.</p><p>Sigh, writing is a constant struggle against one's own sleep schedule.</p>
