<h1>Chapter 1167: Another Advance</h1><p>The Feather Demon King's demeanor remained as majestic as ever, exuding an air of authority despite the lack of any noticeable fluctuations in his aura. In such a place, one could not employ any probing techniques. However, facing the Feather Demon King, Qin Sang could sense a faint, almost imperceptible pressure, which naturally put him on guard.</p><p>It was said that the Feather Demon King was at the mid-stage of transformation, slightly weaker than the Crimson-Haired Patriarch and the True One Daoist back in the day. Over the years, the Feather Demon King had rarely made any moves, and no one could accurately gauge his current strength. The accumulated wealth left by successive generations of Feather Demon Kings was a vast treasure trove, and it was certain that the Feather Demon King's power was far more profound than it appeared on the surface. Facing such a regional overlord, Qin Sang did not dare to show the slightest negligence.</p><p>"Greetings, Feather King," the Red-Tailed Demon King stepped forward and cupped his hands in salute. Qin Sang followed suit.</p><p>"Please, both of you, take a seat," the Feather Demon King gestured with his hand, his gaze settling on Qin Sang with a smile. "This fellow Daoist seems unfamiliar. You must be the one Li Hong mentioned—Daoist Mingyue, correct?"</p><p>"My Daoist title is Mingyue. I hope the Feather King and all fellow Daoists will offer guidance in the future," Qin Sang nodded, cupping his hands in a circle to acknowledge the other demon kings present.</p><p>The moment he entered, Qin Sang felt the probing and scrutinizing gazes of the others fall upon him. Fortunately, he did not sense any overt hostility. It seemed that the Wanderer had maintained decent relationships in the past.</p><p>Those seated here were all great demons at the transformation stage, and they each returned Qin Sang's gesture with a nod. However, not all of them had fully taken on human forms. Some, like the Red-Tailed Demon King, retained their most distinctive features. Others, despite being at the transformation stage, could not fully transform due to their bloodline limitations and remained in their demonic forms. In short, these demon kings presented a variety of appearances, some bizarre and others grotesque.</p><p>Qin Sang had inquired in detail with the Red-Tailed Demon King beforehand and could roughly recognize their identities. The Puppeteer Demon King was not present here. However, Qin Sang noticed a half-human, half-snake demon seated to the Feather Demon King's right. This demon's title was simple—Snake King. That alone spoke volumes.</p><p>The Snake King's reputation and strength were second only to the Feather Demon King, and he had recently broken through to the mid-stage of transformation. However, it was said that the Snake King was extremely cunning and had never openly opposed the Feather Demon King. Additionally, the Snake King held another identity—he was the father-in-law of the Puppeteer Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang took his seat beside the Red-Tailed Demon King. His gaze inadvertently met the Snake King's, who nodded at him with a smile, seemingly unaware that Qin Sang was the thief who had infiltrated his son-in-law's cave.</p><p>Once they were seated, the Feather Demon King gave a slight nod and said, "Now that most of the fellow Daoists attending this meeting have arrived, let us proceed directly to the main matters at hand."</p><p>The demon kings all straightened their expressions.</p><p>The Feather Demon King paused briefly before getting straight to the point. "The reason I have summoned all of you today is primarily for a few matters. The first is the one that concerns you the most—the Purple Mansion. Due to the recent anomalies in the timing of the Purple Mansion's emergence, over the years, both we and the humans have been closely monitoring the changes deep within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Not long ago, we indeed discovered something unusual."</p><p>"What kind of anomaly? The Ancient Immortal Battlefield hasn't experienced a spiritual tide yet, has it?" A burly, bear-like demon king with a deep, rumbling voice couldn't wait to ask. He called himself the Black Wind Demon King, a transformed black bear demon, his face still covered in short, coarse black fur, making him look very much like a bear.</p><p>The Feather Demon King was not offended by the interruption and explained, "Although the Ancient Immortal Battlefield has not yet experienced a spiritual tide, not long ago, I personally ventured there with a human Nascent Soul cultivator and discovered that the Purple Mansion's immortal formation has begun to exhibit abnormal fluctuations."</p><p>The demon kings immediately understood the implications. Fluctuations in the immortal formation were also a precursor to the emergence of the Purple Mansion.</p><p>The Red-Tailed Demon King interjected, "The intervals between the Purple Mansion's appearances have been getting shorter and shorter. The last time was only a little over a hundred years ago. Could it be that this time it will be even shorter, emerging within the next few years?"</p><p>"Fellow Daoists must have sensed this as well, just like the Red-Tailed Demon King. However, this time it likely won't be that quick..." The Feather Demon King shook his head. "After all, there are no signs of a spiritual tide yet. We will probably have to wait a bit longer. However, it is certain that the interval will be shorter again. I estimate that even if the interval is longer this time, it will not exceed a hundred years, and it is more likely to be even shorter."</p><p>Hearing this, the demon kings exchanged glances.</p><p>A female demon sighed, "If it's shorter, will it be fifty years? Or seventy? It's been about forty years since the last emergence. Counting the time, it won't be long now."</p><p>"If this continues, the Purple Mansion will emerge more and more frequently. Could it be that in the future, the Purple Mansion will be completely exposed, allowing us to enter and search for treasures at will?" One demon king's tone carried a hint of excitement.</p><p>The mere thought of such a possibility stirred a fervor not only in this demon king but in all of them.</p><p>The Purple Mansion was undeniably a treasure trove, filled with secrets from ancient times. Over the years, countless experts had ventured inside. However, the time they could spend within was always limited. Many of the immortal formations and ancient restrictions were not entirely impossible to break, but the lack of time prevented them from conducting thorough research. To this day, the areas they had explored were but a fraction of the entire Purple Mansion.</p><p>Especially the inner palace! The Seal Hall, the Ancient Medicine Garden, the Heavenly Mountain... Each of these places was shrouded in mystery, captivating the imagination.</p><p>All signs indicated that the Purple Mansion far surpassed the Nascent Soul level. Even if they could comprehend just a tenth or a fifth of its secrets, it would be beyond the wildest dreams of all the demon kings present.</p><p>Qin Sang had been silently listening, not uttering a word. His mind was occupied with another matter.</p><p>The Purple Mansion was connected to the Canglang Sea and even the Demon Sea. If the Purple Mansion were to become freely accessible in the future, the only passage would be under his control. It was clear to anyone that this held immense potential benefits.</p><p>The question was how to capitalize on these benefits without becoming a target for all. This required careful consideration.</p><p>"Let's not get too excited too soon. Abnormalities don't necessarily mean good news. What if the Purple Mansion's immortal formation is on the verge of collapse, leading to these anomalies?" The female demon spoke calmly, pouring cold water on their enthusiasm.</p><p>"If that's the case, it would be bad enough if the Purple Mansion simply self-destructed. At worst, we'd lose a treasure-hunting secret realm. After all, after so many expeditions, most of the easily accessible treasures have already been taken. However, the Purple Mansion is intricately linked to the spiritual tide. What if its collapse impacts the entire Ancient Immortal Battlefield, or even the barrier surrounding it? Have you considered the consequences?"</p><p>The hall fell into silence.</p><p>They understood that the Purple Mansion might indeed be on the brink of self-destruction. The cracks in the immortal formation within the inner palace were clear evidence.</p><p>This barrier protected billions of lives in the Northern Dipper Realm. If it were torn apart, it was uncertain how much of the realm would remain habitable. While they might be able to flee to the other three realms, most other beings would struggle to survive here.</p><p>"Haha, fellow Daoist, your words are a bit alarmist. If the barrier were so easily destroyed, it wouldn't have stood intact for countless years," the Red-Tailed Demon King broke the silence, turning to Qin Sang. "What do you think, Daoist Mingyue?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement.</p><p>He reminded himself not to be carried away by excitement. Only by strengthening himself would he have the power to hold onto what was rightfully his!</p>
