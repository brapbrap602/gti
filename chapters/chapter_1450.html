<h1></h1><p>Island in the Center of the Lake.</p><p>Inside a bamboo building.</p><p>The puppet maidservants quietly guarded outside the door.</p><p>Inside the room, two women sat on bamboo chairs.</p><p>One of the women wore a silver half-mask, her hair styled in a high bun. Beneath the mask were a straight, delicate nose and lips as red as glazed porcelain, with a faint smile playing at the corners of her mouth.</p><p>She wore an emerald green long dress, her shoulders delicately sloped, her waist slender, leaning slightly against the bamboo chair, exuding an aura of laziness.</p><p>Her hands rested casually on the armrests, her wrists snow-white, the ice crystal bracelet on her wrist appearing even more crystalline and translucent.</p><p>A pair of almond eyes, filled with curiosity, gazed at the darkness outside the room. Then, she raised a finger and tapped her chin thoughtfully, appearing eager to try something. It seemed she wanted to break the restriction and see what was outside, and what tricks the Myriad Demons Assembly was playing.</p><p>Opposite her sat a woman dressed in white, as pure as snow.</p><p>This woman wore a veil, her legs together, sitting properly on the bamboo chair, emanating a cold aura, as if she were a statue carved from ice.</p><p>She also wore a similar bracelet on her wrist, but otherwise, she had no other adornments. The features beneath her veil were exquisitely perfect, her lips slightly pursed, with only a faint hint of color.</p><p>Her eyes were tightly closed, and her body seemed to be enveloped in a faint cold light, isolating her from the world, aloof and independent.</p><p>The two women were none other than Shi Xue and Liuli, as referred to by the Xuan Tian Palace elder.</p><p>Shi Xue looked up and down at the darkness outside, finally abandoning the idea of probing. She retracted her gaze and looked at Liuli, who sat motionlessly, the corners of her mouth curving into a smile, and habitually teased, "Shimei, I told you to put on that long dress, but you refused. Anyone with eyes can see that your attire is a clear indication of our relationship with Xuan Tian Palace. This robe is too stiff and old-fashioned, what a waste of your beauty! Well, perhaps it's for the best, lest those old demons discover such a stunning beauty and snatch you away to be their mountain stronghold wife. Then I'd have nothing to admire."</p><p>Liuli slowly opened her eyes, her pupils deep and profound, as if a ball of azure light was brewing inside. Her gaze was ethereal, yet also held a hint of solitude.</p><p>Seeming dissatisfied with Shi Xue's words, a ripple appeared in Liuli's eyes, and her delicate eyebrows furrowed slightly.</p><p>"Alright, alright..."</p><p>Shi Xue quickly placated her, "How could I bear to let our great beauty fall into the hands of those devils? If Shifu knew in the afterlife, she would never forgive me!"</p><p>"Shifu..."</p><p>Liuli paused, repeating the two words as if in a murmur.</p><p>Shi Xue realized she had spoken out of turn and quickly changed the subject, "Shimei, if we can buy suitable treasures at the Myriad Demons Assembly, we should go to Di Tong Island on the way back and try to get a few Di Tong fruits. You can try to break through your bottleneck. With luck, you might be able to cultivate the Ice Soul Divine Light to a great success, and then you can meet the Holy Land's conditions."</p><p>Seeing her shimei nod almost imperceptibly, Shi Xue secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>She knew her shimei was cold and taciturn, and continued to speak on her own, "Shimei, have you noticed anything strange these past two days? I think I've discovered people from the Enforcement Hall in the city, perhaps even elders."</p><p>Liuli seemed somewhat absent-minded. After a moment, she realized her shijie was asking her a question. Her eyes flickered and her tone was indifferent.</p><p>"Perhaps."</p><p>Content with getting a response from her shimei, Shi Xue twirled the bracelet on her wrist and continued, "The Enforcement Hall is good at what they do. It wouldnâ€™t be easy for us to notice them, probably because we are not their target and they didn't bother hiding themselves in front of us. Could something big be about to happen at the Myriad Demons Assembly? I don't know why, but I feel uneasy. Alas, not only are there great demons on the island, but there is also a Great Sage of the demon race. If we run into trouble, we must immediately ask the elders for help..."</p><p>Before she finished speaking, the bracelet suddenly lit up with a faint light.</p><p>Shi Xue's mouth fell slightly open. She abruptly stood up, swept her divine sense over the bracelet, and exchanged a look with Liuli, a look of surprise on her face. Silently she mouthed, "It's Elder Mei..."</p><p>Then, Shi Xue cautiously placed a layer of restrictions around herself, and lightly tapped a crystal stone on the bracelet. Elder Mei's familiar voice came from within.</p><p>"Shi Xue, are you and Liuli on the Island in the Center of the Lake?"</p><p>Shi Xue replied in a low voice, "Yes! Elder Mei, what's wrong?"</p><p>...</p><p>While Shi Xue was in hushed conversation with Elder Mei, Liuli placed her hands on her knees and also stood up from the bamboo chair, shifting her gaze to the darkness outside the bamboo building.</p><p>Gradually, her brow furrowed even deeper, her lips pressed tightly together, and a hint of confusion surfaced in her eyes.</p><p>Elder Mei quickly explained the whole story simply.</p><p>Shi Xue's face was full of shock. She asked several questions in quick succession before she dared to believe the news was true. The Xuan Tian Palace's sacred treasure had been stolen by a traitor!</p><p>"Remember to conceal your whereabouts, don't be discovered by the claws of Old Man Hunmo. Elder Lan and I will wait for you outside the island."</p><p>Elder Mei ended the conversation.</p><p>The light on the bracelet died out.</p><p>Shi Xue's expression was extremely solemn, with a hint of anxiety, "Elder Mei ordered us to leave Hunmo Island immediately to help retrieve the sacred treasure. What do we do?"</p><p>"Leave!"</p><p>Liuli retracted her gaze, her expression returned to normal, and she turned to walk out the door.</p><p>...</p><p>In another bamboo building.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely unaware of the undercurrents surging outside.</p><p>He seemed to be closing his eyes to rest, but in reality, he had been paying attention to the mysterious ice chest.</p><p>Until now, the mysterious ice chest had shown no signs of abnormality. In this case, Qin Sang couldn't tell if the Xuan Tian Palace could sense the mysterious ice chest. He could only be careful of his surroundings when he leaves.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>The mist on the Island in the Center of the Lake frequently parted, and Nascent Soul ancestors landed on the island one by one, led by puppet maidservants into the bamboo buildings.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed in the bamboo building and couldn't see what was outside, so he had no way of knowing how many Nascent Souls had arrived.</p><p>*Dang!*</p><p>Suddenly a bell rang.</p><p>Then the restriction outside the door was triggered. Qin Sang called out for them to enter, and the puppet maidservant entered holding a jade token. Having already learned the rules of the Myriad Demons Assembly, Qin Sang took the jade token and looked it over.</p><p>Later, when the trade fair begins, the participants take turns explaining the treasures they want to obtain and sell.</p><p>When the jade token lights up, it means it is Qin Sang's turn.</p><p>Of course, there are also many people who do not have a clear goal. They can urge the restriction on the jade token to skip themselves.</p><p>In addition, the jade token is also a disguise, and everyone's voices are exactly the same.</p><p>*Dang!*</p><p>*Dang!*</p><p>Soon, two more bell sounds rang in succession.</p><p>Three bells, the trade fair begins!</p><p>"The time has come, the fellow daoists who should have arrived are almost all here, the trade fair begins now!"</p><p>A deep, old voice suddenly rang out outside the bamboo building.</p><p>Venerable Chongtai!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind flashed with this name. This person has been in charge of the last two Myriad Demons Assemblies, and it is said that his cultivation is strong, only one step away from being a Great Cultivator.</p><p>"The flow of the trade fair, everyone has already heard the puppet maidservants introduce it, this old man doesn't need to waste his breath. The rules are the same as before... Presumably everyone will not disappoint us!"</p><p>The old man's voice came slowly, reminding and warning everyone on the Island in the Center of the Lake.</p>
