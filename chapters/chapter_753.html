<h1>Chapter 745: Blood Moon Formation Activation</h1><p>“Look! What's that?!”</p><p>Just before midnight, as everyone wondered why the Immortal Formation remained inactive, someone spotted an anomaly and pointed towards the eye of the hurricane, exclaiming in surprise.</p><p>Behind the gray wind wall, a point of blood-red light had appeared at some unknown time.</p><p>Judging by its position, the blood light was clearly at the deepest part of the hurricane, yet those standing outside could see it distinctly, and it was incredibly vibrant!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze narrowed slightly. He knew that with this unusual phenomenon appearing, the formation breaking process might have already begun inside.</p><p>“Everyone, take out your jade pendants. These pendants will provide protection; otherwise, we won't be able to move an inch within the Immortal Formation."</p><p>Following Xiang Yi's order, everyone took out their respective jade pendants.</p><p>At that moment, Xiang Yi suddenly produced a talisman. With a flick of his finger, the talisman ignited spontaneously without any flame. A cluster of transparent threads shot out, landing on the jade pendants held by the others.</p><p>Everyone was on high alert but unable to stop the threads.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Xiang, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>The young man with the sword's expression darkened as he questioned coldly.</p><p>Xiang Yi smiled faintly. “Please remain calm, everyone. I am concerned that you might encounter unforeseen circumstances during the formation traversal and become separated. We all know time is of the essence, and I doubt anyone wants to waste time and effort searching for each other once inside, right? The Seven Kills Hall is quite vast. If we get separated, regrouping won't be easy. I will naturally undo the talisman later.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned inwardly, urging his divine sense to examine the threads, but he couldn't discern what kind of power they possessed.</p><p>This mission was supposedly related to the leader of the East Pole Alliance.  If anyone planned to leave the Seven Kills Hall and betray the Alliance, out of the seven people present, probably no one would dare to break their word.</p><p>The East Pole Alliance was a colossal force with influence everywhere. Its leader was also a supreme expert.</p><p>Both righteous and demonic cultivators, as well as other trade alliances, wouldn't hesitate to give the leader face. Angering the leader would make traversing both the Inner Sea and the Demon Sea incredibly difficult.</p><p>However, it wasn't impossible that someone might be audacious enough to seize the opportunity during the formation traversal and escape.</p><p>The jade pendants were extremely fragile, shattering at the slightest touch. If Xiang Yi wanted to manipulate them secretly, it would be incredibly simple. The fact that he openly cast the threads was likely a warning.</p><p>As long as it didn't interfere with his search for the ancient传送阵, Qin Sang didn't want to risk provoking the East Pole Alliance, so he didn't mind the threads.</p><p>Although the others were dissatisfied, they also endured it.</p><p>After this brief interruption, everyone finally noticed that the blood-red light had slowly risen from the center of the hurricane, like a blood moon hanging high in the sky, directly facing the hurricane.</p><p>At that moment, without any warning, the blood moon suddenly shattered.</p><p>Countless fragments of the blood moon exploded.</p><p>In an instant, a dazzling blood light erupted, descending from the sky and rushing straight towards the center of the hurricane. A strange, invisible wave suddenly burst forth from the hurricane's center, instantly sweeping in all directions.</p><p>Impacted by the wave, everyone's minds trembled. They stared intently at the hurricane, not even blinking.</p><p>“Blood Moon Formation Activation,”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured softly, recalling the scene of the Small North Star Yuan Formation breaking the Immortal Formation years ago.</p><p>Unfortunately, the spectacle of the blood light impacting the Immortal Formation was blocked by the hurricane, and the inside remained a chaotic mess, impossible to see through.</p><p>The strange wave continued to erupt. While lacking a world-shaking impact, it was deeply unsettling.</p><p>“The wind wall is cracking! The formation is broken, let's go!”</p><p>Someone suddenly shouted.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze and saw that the gray wind wall, originally seamless, had now cracked open, revealing a fissure.</p><p>The turbulence from the center of the hurricane spread outwards. After the first crack appeared, the entire wind wall suddenly fragmented, crisscrossed by fissures of all sizes.</p><p>The hurricane seemed on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The underwater vortex was also in turmoil.</p><p>At this moment, the surrounding wind force actually weakened considerably, even experiencing a momentary lull.</p><p>Xiang Yi was no slower than the others. Upon seeing the cracks, he immediately ordered everyone to charge in.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others followed closely behind. With a few flashes, they appeared before the wind wall, selecting a small fissure and plunging in without hesitation.</p><p>After entering the fissure, their vision narrowed further. Gray mist was everywhere, obscuring everything else. As for the Seven Kills Hall’s Immortal Formation, they couldn't even tell its direction.</p><p>However, the jade pendants would guide them.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others followed Xiang Yi's instructions, staying close to him.</p><p>Not long after they entered, the restrictions within the jade pendants activated on their own, seemingly connecting with something at the hurricane's center. Immediately, eight blood-red beams of light shot towards them, instantly enveloping them.</p><p>“Blood Moon Light. It seems this is the formation's power Xiang Yi mentioned, capable of protecting us.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.</p><p>After being enveloped by the blood light, the terrifying pressure vanished. The blood light shielded them from the hurricane's erosion.</p><p>They continued forward. The scenery remained unchanged, consistently gray and misty. However, the blood light grew increasingly intense, clearly indicating unknown changes occurring outside.</p><p>The blood light became increasingly dazzling, making it almost impossible to see the outside world with the naked eye.</p><p>In such a place, they didn't dare to release their divine senses and probe carelessly.</p><p>They could only follow the guidance of their jade pendants and silently move forward.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A terrifying force suddenly appeared ahead, slamming into them.</p><p>The blood light trembled, producing violent fluctuations.</p><p>Trapped within the blood light, they were powerless, able to do nothing but worry as they watched the blood light anxiously, fearing it would shatter.</p><p>Fortunately, the fluctuations came and went quickly, and the blood light returned to calm.</p><p>But the peace didn't last. Soon, a new impact arrived, even stronger than before, relentless and wave after wave.</p><p>Frequently bombarded, the blood light thinned, finally allowing Qin Sang to faintly glimpse the outside scene. To his surprise, it seemed that water waves were impacting them.</p><p>These spirit stones were well spent. Without the jade pendants, relying on his own power, he would have been completely unable to traverse the Immortal Formation.</p><p>Although appearing thin, the blood light remained remarkably resilient, protecting them and keeping their formation intact.</p><p>Gradually, everyone felt reassured.</p><p>“We should be almost through the Immortal Formation.”</p><p>Qin Sang had been silently calculating the time, comparing it to the information he had previously gathered, estimating they were close.</p><p>“The Seven Kills Hall, the Purple Subtlety Palace… what is the connection between them? Is the ancient传送阵 really in the Celestial Tower? After waiting for fifty years, I've finally entered. I hope I can find something useful…”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of emotion, his mind wandering. Then he abruptly lowered his head, staring intently at the Thousand Jun Ring on his hand, an expression of utter surprise on his face.</p><p>Just now, a strange fluctuation had emanated from the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>With a sweep of his divine sense, he discovered that the bone flute, now fused with two sections, was shimmering, pointing towards his left.</p><p>After the bone flute had fused, no matter how Qin Sang tried to manipulate it, it had remained unresponsive, never exhibiting such an anomaly before.</p><p>Such a clear indication was unprecedented.</p><p>“It's calling!”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. “Is it the other section of the bone flute, or something else? Why didn't it react this way when I encountered the second section?”</p>
