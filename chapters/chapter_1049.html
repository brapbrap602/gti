<h1>Chapter 1441: Blood Stained Secret Cave</h1><p>Chapter 1441: Blood Stained Secret Cave</p><p>‘Click!’</p><p>A crisp sound.</p><p>The sound, though faint, was like a thunderclap to the cultivators’ ears!</p><p>A fine crack appeared on the protective barrier.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes burned with intensity as they frantically attacked the barrier.</p><p>More and more cracks appeared, but the sealing barrier remained surprisingly sturdy.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed sharply.</p><p>He saw that…</p><p>Elder Ye suddenly stopped, the runes on his body flickering, his aura shifting unpredictably, while Su Nu and the others began to close in towards the center.</p><p>“The seal hasn't been broken, yet Elder Ye is about to make a move?”</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, causing him to tense up. He quickly popped several spirit pills into his mouth and began to rapidly manipulate hand seals.</p><p>The cultivators were restless.</p><p>Around the barrier, bursts of strange light erupted one after another as everyone converged on the seal, poised to strike.</p><p>‘Crack… crack…’</p><p>More and more cracks appeared on the sealing barrier.</p><p>Suddenly, a resounding clang echoed in everyone's ears.</p><p>Everyone was startled.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a blade of light suddenly shot up from the ground, instantly descending above the barrier. The blade energy soared into the sky, tearing through the black mist, splitting apart in a flash before a myriad of horrified gazes.</p><p>The blade light was dazzling, an endless eruption of blade energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's body tensed.</p><p>This strike came from Elder Ye.</p><p>The moment the blade light appeared, Qin Sang understood that what Su Nu had said was true—it was confirmed, Elder Ye had indeed snuck in here.</p><p>Only a Nascent Soul master could unleash such a terrifying attack.</p><p>“Get out of the way!”</p><p>With the sudden appearance of the blade light, a furious roar followed.</p><p>It was like a thunderclap exploding in their ears, causing the cultivators to be terrified.</p><p>The blade light descended from the sky, swift as lightning.</p><p>The few cultivators closest to the barrier were the first to bear the brunt, including Xue Fu, Daoist Xiao Yun, and other core disciples from various sects.</p><p>They were among the most outstanding Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Cang Lang Sea, desperate for the Soul Cleansing Liquid.  If the amount of Soul Cleansing Liquid hadn't been unexpectedly small, they would have almost certainly each received a bottle.</p><p>Now, their position at the forefront gave Elder Ye the opportunity to wipe them out in one fell swoop.</p><p>To catch the thief, one must first catch the king. By incapacitating these few, the remaining cultivators would be leaderless, a disorganized mess unable to mount a siege in the short term, allowing for a swift retreat.</p><p>This attack came without warning. Everyone's attention had been focused on the Soul Cleansing Liquid, and the sudden attack caught everyone off guard. No one expected a hidden dragon among them!</p><p>At that moment, Xue Fu and the others were utterly horrified.</p><p>Locked in by the terrifying blade energy, everyone froze, as if trapped in quicksand.</p><p>Their hairs stood on end, their faces pale.</p><p>These individuals had varying degrees of familiarity with each other, roughly understanding each other's strengths and weaknesses. Even the strongest had their limits.</p><p>“Nascent Soul…”</p><p>Someone’s teeth chattered, barely squeezing out these two words.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Someone roared in fury and terror.</p><p>This strike was terrifying, potentially cleaving them in two instantly.</p><p>Xue Fu was enraged, his expression contorted, but he felt utterly helpless.</p><p>He didn't understand how such a strong opponent could appear, given the trial realm's restrictions on Nascent Soul cultivators.  But regardless of whether the opponent was a Nascent Soul master or not, the power of the blade light was undeniable.</p><p>With their lives threatened, who would still care about the Soul Cleansing Liquid?</p><p>Xue Fu's only concern was survival.</p><p>But the blade light was as fast as lightning. He only had time to frantically pour all his true energy into his protective armor.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Before the armor could fully brace itself, it shattered in a moment under the blade light.</p><p>Xue Fu still didn't give up. He didn't know what secret technique he used, but his blood energy erupted, his blood bat shadow reappeared, flapping its wings and rising, enveloping the blade light like a curtain of blood.</p><p>‘Sizzle!’</p><p>The blood bat shadow was silently cleaved in two.</p><p>Xue Fu’s body shook violently.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Xue Fu's scream sent shivers down everyone's spines.</p><p>Blood, seemingly mixed with bone fragments, sprayed from the air as he tumbled away like a rag doll. His final technique had bought him time, preventing instant death, but he was severely injured, his accumulated blood energy completely depleted.</p><p>Daoist Xiao Yun, sensing the power of the blade light, looked grave.</p><p>Instead of confronting it directly like Xue Fu, he quickly took out a palm-sized wooden carving from his pouch.</p><p>The carving was exquisitely crafted, complete with limbs, but its face was blank, lacking features.</p><p>As he took out the carving, Daoist Xiao Yun squeezed out a drop of his essence blood and injected it into the carving.  The carving's face began to writhe, features appearing, remarkably similar to Daoist Xiao Yun.</p><p>‘Whizz!’</p><p>The blade light descended.</p><p>Daoist Xiao Yun didn't resist, and was split in two from head to toe.</p><p>The next moment, a strange scene unfolded.</p><p>Daoist Xiaoyun's "corpse" vanished into thin air.  A ripple appeared in the void beside him, and he reappeared, a matching wound now visible on the wooden carving in his hand.  He appeared unharmed, but his breath was weak, his face pale and bloodless. Clearly, the cost of using the carving was significant, his condition little better than Xuefu's.</p><p>The others were in even worse shape than Xuefu and Xiaoyun, with severed limbs, horrific wounds, and their lives hanging by a thread.</p><p>Master Ye had incapacitated Xuefu and his men with a single strike, staining the cave with blood.</p><p>One side had planned meticulously, the other was completely unprepared, and the disparity in strength was overwhelming. The outcome was predictable.</p><p>The cultivators at the periphery, terrified, scrambled to retreat.</p><p>"Out of respect for your sect," Master Ye sneered, "I'll spare your lives! Anyone who dares to approach will face my wrath!"</p><p>He let out a cold snort, changed his hand seals, and the remaining blade energy coalesced, striking the sealing barrier with tremendous force.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The already fractured barrier shattered.</p><p>The seal was broken!</p><p>The Soul Cleansing Liquid was within reach, but witnessing Xuefu's fate, no one dared to move.</p><p>Before everyone, Master Ye formed a phantom hand and reached for the high platform.  A *clink* echoed as he grasped four bottles of the liquid, drawing them towards him.</p><p>Seeing the cultivators cowed and the Soul Cleansing Liquid almost in his possession, a smile touched Master Ye's lips, only to freeze instantly!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A deafening thunderclap, bright as day, erupted from the depths of the cave.</p><p>An overwhelmingly powerful aura descended!</p><p>Master Ye looked up sharply, his face changing drastically.</p><p>Not far away, Qin Sang remained calm, his fingers forming lightning seals as he unleashed the *Thunder Control Technique*, targeting Master Ye.</p><p>That strike had surprised even Qin Sang.</p><p>The gap between Core Formation and Nascent Soul cultivators was truly vast.</p><p>Had Master Ye not been restricted in his cultivation, Qin Sang wouldn't have dared to challenge him. He would have had to watch Master Ye take the Soul Cleansing Liquid and then seek a way to trade with Lady Su.</p><p>From the moment Master Ye moved, Qin Sang had been watching him intently, missing nothing.</p><p>He discovered, as Lady Su had said, that after unleashing his cultivation, Master Ye could only make this one strike.  The moment he struck, a strange fluctuation appeared in the void, suggesting the trial realm was suppressing him, his aura plummeting.</p><p>However, the other cultivators were intimidated by the fierce blade energy, and Master Ye concealed his condition well; no one saw through his ruse.</p>
