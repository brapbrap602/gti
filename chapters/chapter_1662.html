<h1>Chapter 1653: Refining Demons with True Yang</h1><p>‘Rumble…Rumble…’</p><p>Heavenly fire ceaselessly slammed down, the roaring deafening.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was obscured by the intense firelight, his features blurred.</p><p>A brief pause.</p><p>Another fireball plummeted before him. Qin Sang, seizing the gap, manifested a protective罡 around himself and plunged resolutely into the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The moment he entered, he triggered the Divine Prohibition. A scorching aura poured over him, his scalp tightening.</p><p>Unseen, crimson clouds surged, birthing new fireballs that locked onto Qin Sang and crashed down with a roar!</p><p>Even more perilous, the nearby fireballs were stirred by his spiritual energy, shifting their trajectories. Those close by hurtled towards him, while those further away seemed to anticipate his flight path, pursuing and intercepting him.</p><p>Qin Sang was like a drop of water in boiling oil; his intrusion threw this realm into chaos.</p><p>From outside, his figure was completely invisible.</p><p>Heavenly fire surrounded Qin Sang on all sides. If struck by even one, even if not instantly incinerated, it would trigger a chain reaction, forcing him to experience the full might of the Divine Prohibition.</p><p>In this situation, Qin Sang could only weave through the gaps between the fireballs, thankful that the Divine Prohibition was masterless.</p><p>Fortunately, to maintain its ceaseless flow, the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition’s descending fire was unyielding, yet the fireballs couldn't relentlessly chase Qin Sang. They wouldn't accumulate endlessly, leaving room to maneuver.</p><p>Most fireballs were destined to plunge into the sea of fire below, reintegrating into the Divine Prohibition.</p><p>However, some collided during their pursuit of Qin Sang. If their internal energy became unstable, they would explode, unleashing dazzling rings of fire, their power no less than the fiery waves below.</p><p>These rings of fire swept across with explosive force.</p><p>Each time, Qin Sang had to flap his phoenix wings, swiftly traversing the gaps within the Yang Yan Heavenly Fire. For the moment, he appeared composed.</p><p>While flying, Qin Sang divided his attention, communicating with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to analyze the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition, while simultaneously invoking a secret art, manifesting a fire lotus in his palm.</p><p>Flames flowed within the fire lotus. Nine Nether Demonic Fire, Ancestral Saint Fire, and other spirit flames he’d subdued flashed alternately as he attempted to use the lotus or one of the spirit flames to resist or guide the Yang Yan Heavenly Fire.</p><p>He focused on both, seeking a way to break the prohibition.</p><p>Not long after Qin Sang entered, Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao arrived at the edge of the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition.  Hesitating briefly, they saw Qin Sang moving deeper and could only follow closely.</p><p>Some of the Yang Yan Heavenly Fire was drawn away by Qin Sang, but the Yang Yan energy within the Divine Prohibition was boundless, and the fireballs surrounding Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao were no fewer than those pursuing Qin Sang.</p><p>In fact, because they kept a distance from each other, they attracted even more fireballs.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Su Zinan flicked his finger, and his black ruler flew from his hand, projecting myriad ruler shadows.</p><p>The shadows didn’t directly strike the Yang Yan Heavenly Fire, as that would cause them to detonate; a lesson learned previously. They struck the empty space, their residual energy dissipating, their force gentler.</p><p>Several fireballs hurtling diagonally were disturbed by the ruler shadows, their trajectories slightly altered, creating a gap.</p><p>Simultaneously, Mo Xingdao formed a shield of profound energy, blocking a ring of fire surging from the side. One after the other, they passed through the opening.</p><p>As a pair, cooperating, they were naturally more adept at handling the situation than Qin Sang. However, in this environment, speed was impossible.</p><p>They could only patiently endure, attempting to counter the heavenly fire with various mystical treasures, continuing their pursuit.</p><p>…</p><p>As the three pursued each other,</p><p>In the distance,</p><p>The two from the Jade Platform Sect deliberately avoided Qin Sang and his pursuers, taking a circuitous route to reach the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition.</p><p>Unable to see the terrifyingly powerful Yang Yan Heavenly Fire, Kun Dao was both fearful and excited, gazing expectantly at her senior brother.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist flicked his wrist, and the Crimson Fire Sword left his hand, flying above their heads, its blade inverted.</p><p>“Yang Yan Seal!”</p><p>He silently formed hand seals, his fingers joined like a sword, swiftly pointing upwards. His fingers turned crimson, and a spark flew to the tip of the Crimson Fire Sword. Flames immediately branched out, flowing across the blade.</p><p>In the next moment, the Crimson Fire Sword hummed, transforming into the Yang Yan Sword. Sword shadows split, manifesting a wheel of swords, the shadows like flowing fire, constantly revolving around them.</p><p>The aura of the flowing fire sword shadows was remarkably similar to that of the Yang Yan Heavenly Fire.</p><p>Controlling the Yang Yan Sword seemed to strain the white-robed Daoist. He nodded to Kun Dao and enveloped them within the whirling swords, flying into the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A mass of Yang Yan Heavenly Fire happened to plummet before them.</p><p>Kun Dao held her breath. Through the fire curtain-like sword shadows, she saw with delight that the Yang Yan Heavenly Fire merely shifted its trajectory slightly, plunging directly into the sea of fire.</p><p>Though the Yang Yan Sword didn't completely mask their presence, its effectiveness was evident. As long as they were cautious, they could proceed unimpeded!</p><p>The white-robed Daoist also breathed a sigh of relief. Too much of their sect's heritage had been lost, including the methods for manipulating the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition. Otherwise, they wouldn't necessarily fear those great cultivators within the prohibition.</p><p>Fortunately, the Yang Yan Seal remained, proving highly effective.</p><p>Under the protection of the sword, they advanced rapidly within the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition. Their speed far surpassed that of Qin Sang and the others, and they had a clear objective.</p><p>They weren't heading straight for the summit but gradually towards the center of the prohibition, where the Yang Yan Heavenly Fire's energy converged.</p><p>Kun Dao initially tried calculating the distance but later gave up, realizing they had already traveled far enough to reach the summit of Divine Bestowment Mountain, yet their destination remained distant. Space was distorted by the prohibition.</p><p>The deeper they went, the more intense the heavenly fire became.</p><p>Even with the sword's protection, they had to proceed with extreme caution.</p><p>After much weaving and maneuvering, they finally reached their objective.</p><p>Before them, heavenly fire rained down, and within the boundless sea of fire, an empty space opened up.</p><p>There were no flames there, and the heavenly fire wouldn't fall into it.  A section of mountain wall and a cave dwelling were revealed.</p><p>The mountain wall appeared abruptly within the sea of fire, surrounded above and below by raging flames. It was likely part of Divine Bestowment Mountain, separated by the prohibition.</p><p>The edge of this area was where the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition was most potent. The two struggled mightily to cross, facing several near-death experiences, their backs drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>Entering the area by the mountain wall, they were astonished. It was eerily calm, devoid of any scorching aura.</p><p>The stone door of the cave dwelling was closed, sealed by a simple restrictive formation.</p><p>The Yang Yan Divine Prohibition outside served as the ultimate defense.</p><p>The two exchanged glances.</p><p>Out of caution, the white-robed Daoist waved his hand, sending out a talisman that transformed into a molten rock golem.  The golem pushed open the stone door, the interior instantly illuminated by the firelight from outside.</p><p>They immediately saw a figure sitting cross-legged just inside, facing away from the entrance.  The back of his head, hair, and flesh appeared intact, lifelike.</p><p>Their hearts pounded, and Kun Dao nearly cried out.</p><p>In the next moment, due to the shift in the cave’s energy, the figure suddenly turned to dust.</p><p>“Dead!”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist’s mind eased. He quickly surveyed the interior and was surprised to find another elderly figure within.</p><p>The elder sat in meditation, enveloped by interwoven flames.  These flames seemed connected to the Yang Yan Heavenly Fire outside, the Yang Yan energy continuously flowing inwards, forming a bell-shaped fiery shield around the elder.</p><p>“This formation… it seems to be refining demons with True Yang…”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist's thoughts raced as his gaze fell upon the top of the fiery bell, where a crimson immortal pendant was embedded in the shield.</p><p></p>
