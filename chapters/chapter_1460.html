<h1></h1><p>A streak of crimson gold light appeared on the eastern horizon, speeding towards them.</p><p>Another master from Profound Heaven Palace was about to arrive.</p><p>Shi Xue had fled west for a distance to escape, causing him to arrive a step later than Chen Yan.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's attention was not on this person.</p><p>This person was not enough to make Qin Sang so vigilant.</p><p>Qin Sang was wary of the two figures that had quietly arrived on the sea surface to the north.</p><p>The water surface there was empty, and the waves were undulating due to the impact of the battle. However, the aftershocks were not very strong there, unlike the center of the battlefield where the giant waves were towering, and large pieces of profound ice were floating everywhere.</p><p>Including Elder Mei Lan, no one had discovered those two people.</p><p>"Old Devil Hunmo!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened.</p><p>The demonic fire armor on his body completely subsided to avoid leaking his aura.</p><p>When he discovered the ambush and decided to attack, he had already quickly gone through the situation and possible subsequent developments in his mind.</p><p>This place was far from Hunmo Island, and the Lost Trace Formation  that Qin Sang had arranged was in front.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo was not like Profound Heaven Palace, who could lock on to Qin Sang's route in advance. Assuming that the battle had just alarmed Old Devil Hunmo, it would take him some time to rush over from Hunmo Island.</p><p>Seeing that Shi Xue had so many unexpected life-saving methods, and that Elders Mei and Lan had arrived in time, Qin Sang did not choose to flee first or propose a transaction, but was determined to capture Shi Xue, for two reasons.</p><p>One was that there was no one in Profound Heaven Palace who could threaten him; that Palace Lord was indeed not there. He wouldn't even need to use the Lost Trace Formation, Qin Sang could easily get rid of them.</p><p>Second, the time had not exceeded his predetermined bottom line.</p><p>Of course, this decision was definitely made after considering various unexpected situations based on the changing situation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, an accident arrived as expected.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo came much earlier than expected, but fortunately, Qin Sang had never relaxed his vigilance.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that Old Devil Hunmo might have been attracted by Profound Heaven Palace, and cursed these guys for not knowing how to be careful after so many people were slaughtered in the Yellow Dragon Scholar's Palace .</p><p>He didn't know the ins and outs, and his reasoning was wrong, but the conclusion cleverly coincided with the facts.</p><p>"This place is not suitable to stay for long!"</p><p>Qin Sang made a decisive decision.</p><p>No matter who Old Devil Hunmo came for, he had to leave immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Old Devil Hunmo had a feud with Profound Heaven Palace, but he would not naively want to use this to make a fuss, provoke a fight between dragons and tigers, and benefit as a fisherman.</p><p>Even if Old Devil Hunmo couldn't see that he was the person who robbed the treasure from the Buddhist Temple, once he guessed that he had a treasure on his body that Profound Heaven Palace coveted, his first choice would definitely be to keep the treasure first, and then consider how to compete with Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>This was Old Devil Hunmo's lair, and he had enough confidence.</p><p>Putting himself in his shoes, Qin Sang would do the same.</p><p>At that time, Qin Sang would be facing Profound Heaven Palace and Old Devil Hunmo at the same time, as well as other passing Nascent Soul cultivators  who were attracted. Even if he had a backup plan, his situation would be quite dangerous.</p><p>His only option was to make peace with Profound Heaven Palace and promise to return the sacred object.</p><p>Such a forced transaction was obviously not conducive to him.</p><p>In an instant, one thought after another flashed through his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang gave up the idea of capturing Shi Xue because she would become a burden in this situation.</p><p>Qin Sang was not sure when Old Devil Hunmo had arrived, or how long he had been watching.</p><p>When entering the Pure Sea Sect, Old Devil Hunmo must have seen the Golden Abyss Sword .</p><p>Before participating in the trade fair, Qin Sang bought some spiritual materials from Dan Ding Mountain during his time on Mingzhu Island and modified the Golden Abyss Sword, but like Tan Hao's Demon Subduing Pestle , he could not completely change its essence, and it was difficult to guarantee that Old Devil Hunmo would not see something.</p><p>He had to leave as soon as possible.</p><p>This was no loss to him. The original plan was just to confirm whether Profound Heaven Palace could sense the mysterious ice box. He intended to capture Shi Xue when he found that this woman was alone and saw the opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his hand on the corpse puppet bag. As a disguise, he took out a handful of elixirs from the Thousand Jun Ring , swallowed them into his belly, took the opportunity to restore some true essence, and cast the Sword Art .</p><p>'Buzz!'</p><p>The Golden Abyss Sword's sword light was dazzling, and its aura was erratic.</p><p>Between Qin Sang and Chen Yan, the seemingly calm void suddenly darkened, and countless sword threads vaguely appeared. However, these sword threads were very stiff, not as flexible as before, and seemed to be frozen by extreme cold.</p><p>At the same time, a cloud of white mist bloomed there. The appearance of this phenomenon indicated that the power of the Ice Soul Divine Light  had erupted and was blocked by the sword formation.</p><p>Qin Sang had a fresh memory of the previous danger. He was very cautious in the face of Chen Yan's strange divine power, so he did not hesitate to restart the sword formation.</p><p>'Crack crack crack...'</p><p>Countless tiny ice shards were shattered by the sword formation, and the Ice Soul Divine Light was invisibly cut.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, the resistance that the Golden Abyss Sword received was not as great as he had imagined.</p><p>"More bark than bite?" </p><p>Qin Sang looked at Chen Yan in surprise and found that the faint blue light in her eyes was no longer clear, but rather scattered, and even faintly showed signs of collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang knew very well that even if Chen Yan recognized him, it was impossible for her to hold back in this situation. First, she was eager to save people, and the woman in green was obviously closely related to her. Second, this divine power was cast by Chen Yan before she recognized him.</p><p>The only explanation was that she could not use this divine power continuously, and forcibly casting it could not compare with the power of the first time.</p><p>"Junior Sister, retreat quickly!"</p><p>Shi Xue also noticed Chen Yan's abnormality, and his face was anxious, not wanting his junior sister to be implicated by him.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep look at Chen Yan, urged the sword formation, and rolled the aftermath back to Chen Yan.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Qin Sang's back felt a prickling pain, and his divine sense sensed that a gray-white bone needle had locked onto him and pierced silently.</p><p>Moreover, the crescent moon formed by the Douri Circle  turned from dim to bright, becoming more and more dazzling, and the light was swallowing and spitting.</p><p>Elders Mei and Lan finally recovered.</p><p>They didn't have time to adjust and use other means. Seeing the urgency of the situation, they still used the previous Bone Piercing Needle  and Douri Circle  that they had sacrificed to force back and restrict Qin Sang first.</p><p>Without looking back, Qin Sang flapped his phoenix wings behind his back, turning into a bolt of lightning and rushing out.</p><p>The Bone Piercing Needle  pierced quickly, but Qin Sang chose the direction very cleverly. This movement happened to let Chen Yan block between him and the Bone Piercing Needle .</p><p>Chen Yan was surrounded by a storm formed by the aftershock and could not take care of him for a while.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Elder Mei's expression was slightly shocked, and he clenched his palm fiercely.</p><p>The Bone Piercing Needle  paused, and the tip of the needle swung, bypassing Chen Yan, thus missing the best opportunity.</p><p>But the attack on Qin Sang was not over yet.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Douri Circle  lit up.</p><p>A beam of light fell from the sky, several times thicker than before.</p><p>This time, Elder Lan learned to be good. He dispersed the power of the Douri Circle  and did not aim at Qin Sang, but enveloped him, freezing the sea water into an ice cage!</p><p>Above the sea.</p><p>Walls of ice grew at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>There were hidden runes flowing inside, which were obviously not ordinary ice walls.</p><p>Although time was short and it had not completely formed yet, Qin Sang would need to use other means to break through the ice wall, which would inevitably be affected.</p><p>It was enough to restrict him for a moment, enough for others to adjust.</p>
