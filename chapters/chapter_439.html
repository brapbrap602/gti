Chapter 432: Each Fleeing for Their Lives


Becoming a Core Formation cultivator isn't as easy as Cang Ling makes it sound.
However, given Han Family Head's talent and the favor of a Core Formation cultivator, his chances are far greater than others.
This kind of opportunity is enviable.

As they spoke, they finally flew out of the turbulent waters.
Everyone concealed their auras, flying close to the water's surface.
Not far out, everyone suddenly stopped, simultaneously looking up at the distant sky, their expressions varied.
It was noon.
The sun was shining brightly, a clear sky without a single cloud.
In the south, where the sky met the water, a patch of crimson clouds was strikingly visible, obscuring a large area of the sky.
The red clouds churned, seemingly concealing countless devouring ghosts. Even from this distance, Qin Sang could faintly sense the terrifying aura emanating from the red clouds, causing his heart to palpitate.
These red clouds were certainly not naturally formed in the Yun Cang Marsh; the battlefield was there!

"Everyone, be careful."
Cang Ling warned, his robes glowing with light before fading, his aura perfectly concealed.
Qin Sang secretly activated the *Duan Ling Jue* (遁灵诀).
After a moment's thought, he took out a three-foot long green blade, gripping it firmly.
This spirit sword was the best he had ever crafted after years of studying sword-making.  It was a top-grade spirit sword containing cold gold, ranking among the best of its kind.
Qin Sang had forged countless swords, but only one similar to this.
Having used up his supply of cold gold, Qin Sang named this sword 'Cold Gold' in remembrance.

However, the Cold Gold Sword was far inferior to the Blackwood Sword, and not solely because the Blackwood Sword was a magic treasure.
The difference was more than just quality.
The Blackwood Sword was Qin Sang's life-bound spirit sword!
Cultivation technique, the divine ability bestowed by the technique, and the life-bound spirit sword were one; the absence of any would be detrimental.  The Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability could only be used with the Blackwood Sword.
No matter how high the quality of other spirit swords, Qin Sang couldn't use the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability with them, and their power was inferior to the Blackwood Sword.
Losing the Blackwood Sword would significantly reduce his strength.

While powerful, using the Blackwood Sword openly wasn't advisable in this situation.
Although he could temporarily conceal its magical treasure aura, this concealment wouldn't last long.
Especially in battle; in a crisis, he wouldn't be able to maintain the concealment, easily revealing a weakness.
Magic treasures are precious even to Core Formation cultivators.
A Foundation Establishment cultivator wielding a magic treasure is like a child showing off gold, attracting unwanted attention; who could guarantee that others wouldn't covet it?
The battlefield was teeming with Core Formation cultivators.  If Qin Sang revealed a weakness, they would detect it, leading to his demise.

Therefore, Qin Sang had decided to avoid using the Blackwood Sword unless absolutely necessary, and even then, he would retreat to find a concealed location.
Or save it for a surprise attack.
Qin Sang held the Cold Gold Sword in one hand and the Yin-Yang Compass in the other. The Yin-Yang Compass could prove exceptionally effective in a chaotic battle.
The others also prepared themselves.

Qin Sang caught up with Cang Ling; the three late Foundation Establishment cultivators led the way, with others following.
As they flew further, the crimson cloud became clearer.
This cloud was extraordinarily vast, covering almost half the sky and engulfing even the Yun Cang Marsh; the waters there were stained crimson, with enormous waves crashing against one another.
The churning clouds resembled the crimson glow of the setting sun.
The crimson clouds blocked their vision, making it impossible to see who was fighting, how many people were involved, or who was winning.
Unable to ascertain the situation, they couldn't make a decision.
Everyone's hearts were filled with unease, mentally cursing Pei Qin's ancestors a hundred and eighty times over.

At that moment, a resounding dragon's roar echoed from afar.
The crimson cloud seemed to be cleaved by someone, splitting down the middle.
A streak of azure sword light pierced the crimson clouds, like a dragon weaving through them.  The sword light was incredibly sharp, the surrounding spiritual energy swirling around the sword light, forming a terrifying hurricane, bringing with it countless sharp blades.
The crimson cloud was severely damaged by the sword light, but was far from dissipating.
Judging by its power, the sword light undoubtedly came from a magic treasure!
Everyone was shocked by the sudden appearance of the magic treasure.


A crimson cloud clashed with a magical artifact—was the cloud itself a magical artifact?

Two magical artifacts collided, and the onlookers couldn't determine which was winning.  They didn't know whose artifacts these were, and thus couldn't hope for a specific outcome.

Then, they realized the blue sword light didn't contain a sword, but a needle-shaped artifact!

"It's Master Fang's Sky-遁 Needle!"

Qiao Jiang pointed, his expression suddenly filled with excitement.  "The Sky-遁 Needle is Master Fang's life-bound artifact. Everyone in our Xu Ling Sect knows about it! Master Fang is alright, everyone, don't worry!"

Hearing this, the anxiety of the others eased slightly.  It was Master Fang who sent the Liu family cultivator to the trading fair for help.

The group had been terrified by the Liu family cultivator's condition, fearing Master Fang was similarly injured.

But judging from the Sky-遁 Needle's terrifying power, Master Fang seemed to be in relatively good condition, not the gravely injured fugitive they'd imagined.

With Pei Qin's assistance, the forces from the Little Cold Region could at least hold their ground and avoid immediate collapse.

"Let's go! Get closer!"

Cang Ling gritted his teeth and accelerated.

They were still far from the battlefield.  The cloud hadn't dispersed, obscuring everything. They couldn't see what the battlefield had become.

Qin Sang frowned slightly, glancing at Cang Ling's back.  After a moment's hesitation, she followed.

Her alertness was at its peak.

Their speed slowed, as they cautiously approached the cloud, still seeing nothing, only hearing the roar of spiritual energy from ahead.

After advancing a short distance, Qin Sang's expression shifted. She stopped abruptly and gestured sharply behind her.

Cang Ling and Fan Zhen, only slightly behind Qin Sang, simultaneously halted their flight.

All three looked towards a nearby body of water, exchanged glances, and then moved instantly!

Prepared for battle, they smoothly formed their practiced formation. Qin Sang and Fan Zhen took flanking positions, while Cang Ling charged forward, reaching the water's surface and surrounding the area.

The others, bewildered and unsure what was happening, remained where they were, afraid to move.

Before the three could fully settle,

with a 'whoosh,' water splashed.

A dark shadow, like a dart, shot from the water, incredibly fast, almost breaking through their encirclement.
