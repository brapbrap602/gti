<h1>Chapter 301: Gathering Herbs</h1><p>As they spoke, they were already entangled in battle with the Man-Headed Eagles.</p><p>With the addition of Qin Sang and Ge Yuan as reinforcements, the power of the Golden Ring Formation surged. The early-stage Spirit Severing Man-Headed Eagle, having been severely wounded when they seized their chance, now only dared to circle at a distance. The other lesser demons dared not approach at all.</p><p>The Man-Headed Eagle attempted to create distance and pick them off one by one, but Qin Sang and the others gave it no such opportunity, relentlessly pursuing it across a vast stretch of the hillside.</p><p>They seized their chance and consecutively ensnared the Eagle's wings and claws with copper rings, finally suppressing the great demon's ferocious aura somewhat, and keeping it barely contained.</p><p>Seeing this opportunity, Qin Sang and Shangguan Lifeng immediately withdrew and split up.</p><p>Ge Yuan, still harboring resentment from his earlier humiliation, urged the yellow copper ring to fiercely attack the Man-Headed Eagle while hastily transmitting his voice to Qin Sang, "The Blue Dew昙 is of great use to me. Daoist Qingfeng, please obtain it for me. I would be eternally grateful!"</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang also received a voice transmission from Yun Youzi, informing him of the locations and types of several spiritual herbs.</p><p>It seemed his efforts wouldn't be in vain, as beneath the mysterious yellow aura was indeed the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence!</p><p>Upon hearing confirmation of the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence, Qin Sang's heart pounded with excitement.  He patiently listened to Yun Youzi's instructions on how to break the spiritual herb's protective restrictions, then immediately dashed towards it.</p><p>The lesser demons, seeing this, swarmed to intercept him.  However, it wasn't a major issue.  Qin Sang reached an unoccupied spot and deployed the Ten Yama Banners.  The soul-burning threads scorched the demons' souls, forcing them back, while he maintained his speed, quickly reaching the long-awaited spiritual herb.</p><p>The Profound-Veined Yellow Essence grew within a crevice, covered by only a thin layer of soil, its roots stubbornly splitting the rock.</p><p>Its leaves were emerald green, broad like lotus leaves, spreading out to form a large patch.</p><p>A section of rootstalk emerged from the crevice, the same color as the mysterious yellow aura emanating from the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence. However, it was incredibly inconspicuous, only as thick as a finger, and wrinkled on the surface, resembling an extremely withered tree root.</p><p>There was no strong medicinal fragrance emanating from it.</p><p>Yet, this was the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence, the main ingredient for the Profound-Veined Harmony Pill!</p><p>Qin Sang's breath grew heavy. He took a long look at the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence, then raised his head, his gaze following a beam of light into the depths of the mist.</p><p>Yun Youzi's information confirmed his suspicions, allowing him to roughly understand the workings of the protective restrictions surrounding the spiritual herbs.</p><p>The restrictions here were uniquely arranged.  The mountain mist, seemingly harmless, was actually part of the restrictions.</p><p>Within this yellow light was not only the mysterious yellow aura of the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence, but also another layer of the restriction hidden within. This was why the essence's aura was so condensed.  Those seemingly faint, slender beams of light were in that state because they were no longer connected to a spiritual herb.</p><p>Once someone attempted to harvest a herb, disturbing its aura, the restriction would be triggered, unleashing lightning. Yun Youzi speculated that the power of the lightning was likely related to the quality of the spiritual herb.</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed this when Ge Yuan attempted to pick the Blue Dew昙.  The lightning was terrifying, capable of annihilating even late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. Otherwise, the herbs would have long been devoured by the Man-Headed Eagles.</p><p>Because of this, he had to be extremely cautious; a single misstep could turn him into ashes beneath the lightning.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang extended his right hand, condensing a small ball of spiritual energy in his palm. With a flick of his finger, he sent it flying towards the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence.</p><p>*Poof!*</p><p>The spiritual energy couldn't harm the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence at all.  Upon contacting the outer layer of the mysterious yellow aura, the light rippled slightly and dispersed the spiritual energy.</p><p>Seeing that the restriction seemed unchanged, Qin Sang no longer hesitated. He secretly activated the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman within his sea of Qi, manifesting the Dragon Spirit around him. He then darted to the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence and reached for it.</p><p>Just like Ge Yuan's experience, as the herb seemed within his grasp, the restriction was triggered. A bright, dazzling net of lightning suddenly erupted.</p><p>Simultaneously, thunder roared above, and Qin Sang appeared to be facing imminent doom.</p><p>These lightning bolts were even more powerful than those Ge Yuan had encountered.</p><p>Prepared for this, Qin Sang immediately activated the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman and retreated rapidly, only stopping after the lightning dissipated. Throughout this process, his gaze remained fixed above, on the point where the herb's aura met the mist.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang heard the enraged cries of the Man-Headed Eagle in the distance. He looked warily in that direction, guarding against the possibility that they hadn't been able to suppress it.</p><p>Fortunately, the demon was firmly restrained by Yun Youzi and the others, allowing him to focus on breaking the restriction.</p><p>#Get888CashRedEnvelope# Follow vx.

His gaze became sharp.</p><p>Although he had discerned the key to the restriction, breaking it still carried considerable risk.</p><p>However, no matter how great the danger, he had to try.</p><p>The Dragon Spirit roared silently as Qin Sang preemptively activated the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman. His Ebony Sword also floated before him, ready for deployment.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, then reappeared beside the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence, instantly triggering the restriction.</p><p>Faced with the onslaught of lightning, Qin Sang, instead of retreating continuously, feigned a retreat.  When the lightning dispersed slightly, he charged head-on!</p><p>In the next instant, Qin Sang was enveloped by lightning.</p><p>He emptied his mind, his eyes fixed on the writhing bolts of lightning.  Without hesitation, he moved at his absolute fastest speed, leaving a series of afterimages.</p><p>These afterimages were instantly shattered by the lightning, but Qin Sang himself weaved through the gaps, flying straight upwards.</p><p>The lightning bolts immediately changed direction, pursuing him relentlessly, but this brief opportunity was all Qin Sang needed.</p><p>The Ebony Sword shot out, striking a specific point where the herb's aura and the mist intersected, producing a resounding clang like a giant bell.</p><p>The light trembled violently, seemingly without much change.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had achieved his objective. He immediately began to flee, repeating the process after the lightning dissipated.</p><p>He repeated this dangerous maneuver time and time again, becoming increasingly adept at navigating the lightning.</p><p>The restriction wasn't completely unaffected, and Qin Sang carefully monitored every subtle change.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>His persistence paid off.  After another resounding boom, the light dimmed considerably, greatly encouraging Qin Sang.</p><p>However, the restriction began to adapt, the mist churning as it started to repair itself.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.  He retrieved a handful of spiritual pills and swallowed them without pause.</p><p>Finally, the Ebony Sword struck the core of the restriction once more. The pillar of light shattered with a whoosh, and the lightning behind him simultaneously dimmed, its power greatly diminished.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. Without hesitation, he turned and swooped downwards, enduring the weakened lightning strikes as he grabbed the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence!</p>
