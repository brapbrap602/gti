<h1>Chapter 1384: Withering</h1><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Lightning struck the sea.</p><p>The seawater was instantly pierced, leaving a bottomless hole.  Waves surged skyward, shimmering silver, countless silver serpents writhing amongst the spray, spreading out like a peacock's tail, brighter than the moon, illuminating the night sky.</p><p>The aftershock of the lightning slowed Bi Fang involuntarily.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity to swiftly close the distance.</p><p>The gap between them narrowed considerably.</p><p>Bi Fang glared at Qin Sang with hatred, spreading its wings wide and suddenly unleashing a powerful gust.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A violent wind erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang's vision was filled with a sea of blood red.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, these crimson entities were sharp, blood-colored feathers, raining down upon him.</p><p>These feathers weren't solid, appearing ethereal, yet their power was undeniable.</p><p>Qin Sang was wary.</p><p>He decided against a desperate fight with Bi Fang, remaining vigilant against any underhanded tactics.</p><p>Therefore, until he ascertained the full power of Bi Fang's technique, he wouldn't act rashly. He slowed his speed, preventing the feathers from reaching him.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A golden light flashed.</p><p>The Jin Chen sword, like a dragon, let out a deep resonant hum. Though still a high-grade magical artifact, in Qin Sang's hands, its power was no less than any other.</p><p>The sword vibrated, emitting streaks of dazzling golden light.</p><p>Golden light filled the sky, blindingly bright, clashing with the blood red.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly shifted his thoughts, and the Jin Chen sword, enveloped in a torrential rain of sword light, shot forth with tremendous force.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>Mid-air, the blood-red feathers and the sword rain collided violently.</p><p>The spectacle was earth-shattering.</p><p>Half the sky was dyed crimson, the other half gleaming gold.</p><p>*Bang bang bang…*</p><p>Explosions echoed continuously.</p><p>One could faintly see feathers shattering and sword light dissipating.</p><p>It seemed neither side had gained a clear advantage.</p><p>Bi Fang's attack was solely to obstruct Qin Sang, and without waiting for a decisive victory, it flew away.</p><p>Qin Sang showed no sign of panic.  After sensing the power of the blood-red feathers, he was reassured.  He made a swift decision, merging man and sword as one, piercing through the crimson.</p><p>…</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A crescent-shaped sword energy followed, its trajectory exceptionally tricky.</p><p>Bi Fang tensed its left wing, transforming it into a blade, striking downwards.  Its feathers stood erect, a bloody glow circulating around them.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>The sound of metal clashing echoed.</p><p>Bi Fang was unharmed.</p><p>But the ensuing impact caused its form to slightly waver.</p><p>Harassed by Qin Sang's relentless attacks, Bi Fang was increasingly annoyed and furious, but found it hard to deal with Qin Sang effectively.  Unless it stopped to engage in a full-scale battle.</p><p>Two streaks of light, one crimson, one azure, tore through the night sky.</p><p>Ironically, moments ago Bi Fang had been pursuing Qin Sang relentlessly, but now the situation had reversed.</p><p>Yet, even as Bi Fang focused on escape, the distance between it and Qin Sang was steadily decreasing.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly sheathed the Jin Chen sword.</p><p>He didn't publicly display the Seven Souls Killing Formation, though using the sword array to hinder Bi Fang would have been easier.</p><p>Instead, he brought out the magic banner.</p><p>When pursued by the frog-fish, he had used the magic fire to try and kill it, failing in the attempt.  The magic fire was already exposed, so there was no need to hide it any longer.</p><p>A piercing sound of air being torn apart followed.</p><p>The spectacle was less grand than that of the Jin Chen sword.</p><p>Yet Bi Fang felt an immediate sense of foreboding. Turning its head, it saw a black fire serpent shooting towards it.  The aura emanating from the Nine Nether Magic Fire caused its mind to tense suddenly, reminding it of the frog-fish’s warning.</p><p>This person wields a strange black fire. The frog-fish, caught off guard, nearly fell victim; it felt the threat of death, still feeling apprehensive even now.</p><p>That must be this magic fire!</p><p>It no longer dared to use its physical body to defend itself.  With no other choice, it dodged to the side.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The black fire serpent brushed past Bi Fang.</p><p>The close encounter with the magic fire's aura sent tremors through Bi Fang's mind, changing its expression. Though it knew from the frog-fish that the magic fire was extraordinary, it had never imagined it to be so powerful, far surpassing any spiritual fire it had ever encountered!</p><p>"Disperse!"</p><p>With a thought from Qin Sang, the magic fire suddenly scattered, transforming into a sea of flames.</p><p>The raging flames seemed to ignite the night sky, the black magic fire appearing incredibly eerie under the moonlight, engulfing Bi Fang in a sudden wave.</p><p>Bi Fang’s eyelids twitched, its long neck tensed, it let out a sharp cry, its feathers standing on end.  A bloody flame erupted from its entire body.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The bloody flames soared, almost obscuring Bi Fang's true form.</p><p>The magic fire pressed down relentlessly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Two incredibly powerful flames collided, unleashing a shockwave that instantly vaporized a layer of water.  Flames erupted in every direction, a spectacle more dazzling than fireworks. The night sky became a fiery inferno.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft “hmm,” slightly surprised.  The blood flames wielded by Bi Fang were some kind of extraordinary technique, surprisingly powerful.  Though the blood flames were being consumed by the demonic flames, they still held their own.</p><p>This skill alone put Bi Fang far above Dongyang Bo.  A truly formidable veteran expert, worthy of his reputation!</p><p>These thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but her movements remained unaffected as she silently channeled more power into the demonic banner.</p><p>While Qin Sang and Bi Fang were locked in combat...</p><p>Elsewhere,</p><p>The human and demon cultivators had clashed countless times, the situation shifting constantly.  However, they shared a single objective: the Xuan Tian Palace traitor!</p><p>Because of this shared goal, neither side was willing to risk a decisive battle, fearing the traitor might escape.  Even during the most intense fighting, they continued their pursuit.</p><p>Eventually, they even left Qin Sang and Bi Fang far behind.</p><p>The two were left undisturbed.</p><p>The humans, confident in their Yuan Ying mid-stage cultivator, Feng Shangshi, felt they held a significant advantage.  The demon kings understood their disadvantage and changed tactics, focusing on apprehending the Xuan Tian Palace traitor, hoping Bi Fang could somehow break free from Qin Sang.</p><p>Rarely seen demon kings and Yuan Ying cultivators engaged in a breathtaking chase, streaking across the sea in a flash.  From afar, their various colored rainbow lights crisscrossed and dispersed, a magnificent sight.</p><p>"Everyone, be careful, we're almost there!"</p><p>Island Master Shen transmitted a warning, adding with a sigh, "I never expected that Friend Mingyue would be so powerful, to actually hold Bi Fang back!"</p><p>Feng Shangshi and the others looked closely,</p><p>but the sea was empty, devoid of any islands or reefs.  The wind howled, the waves crashed.</p><p>Madam Yue mentally calculated their position, her brows furrowing slightly. "We'll be entering the storm zone soon..."</p><p>Before she could finish, Island Master Shen's cry interrupted her.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Island Master Shen opened his palm, revealing that the blood insect was withering, visibly melting into a foul-smelling black liquid, utterly decaying like a dying flower.  Simultaneously, he lost his connection to the mark.</p><p>His expression changed drastically, suddenly understanding. He looked up to see a fist-sized rainbow rat emerging from the eagle demon's feathers, its gaze filled with intense hatred.</p>
