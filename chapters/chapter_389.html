<h1>Chapter 382: Jungle and Flower Sea</h1><p>Just then, the two Nascent Soul cultivators seemed to have finished their discussion.</p><p>They separated, pressing themselves against the cliff walls, facing each other. Simultaneously, they raised their hands, and boundless spiritual energy surged forth, converging between them.</p><p>Gradually, this spiritual energy formed a shimmering sphere, which then expanded at a visible pace.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't sense the sphere's aura, but he could see how much spiritual energy was contained within such a large sphere. If it were him, he wouldn't even be able to sustain its creation; his spiritual sea would be instantly drained.</p><p>Yet, the two Nascent Soul cultivators remained relaxed as the sphere rapidly expanded without any sign of stopping.</p><p>The gap between him and a Nascent Soul cultivator was immense, as one could imagine.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the sphere reached its maximum size and then began to deform. It stretched vertically, eventually transforming into a giant sword of light. It then collapsed inward, finally compressing into a sword only as tall as a person, its light restrained and substantial.</p><p>The sword hung upside down, pointing downwards, and suddenly vanished from sight.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang felt the ground tremble slightly.</p><p>Immediately after, from the crevice between the two mountains, endless rays of light erupted, shooting towards the two Nascent Soul cultivators in the air.</p><p>Surprisingly, even the Nascent Soul cultivators had to dodge and weave to avoid these rays.</p><p>However, the rays grew more numerous, like living things. No matter how they dodged, the rays would entwine around them with uncanny flexibility, like a clinging shadow.</p><p>Just then, one of the Nascent Soul cultivators, unable to avoid a ray of light, had half of his robe torn away. Seemingly enraged by the clinging light, he suddenly opened his hand, and a black, circular object shot out from his palm.</p><p>The object spun rapidly, growing as it flew.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi finally saw clearly that it was a Black Tortoise Shell!</p><p>The shell was jet-black, inscribed with mysterious patterns.  Because they were too far away, they couldn't tell if the shell was a magical treasure or some other wondrous item.</p><p>The other Nascent Soul cultivator shook his head upon seeing this and didn't follow suit. Instead, he leaped to his companion's side, attracting all the rays of light to himself.</p><p>The tortoise shell hovered in mid-air, radiating a profound light, and enveloped the rays. The light struggled to resist, but it was steadily pushed back, eventually suppressed by the tortoise shell and vanishing without a trace.</p><p>Merely observing this silent battle, Qin Sang was captivated and felt tense.  The Nascent Soul cultivator had easily extinguished the seemingly powerful rays of light with a single tortoise shell, leaving Qin Sang filled with admiration.</p><p>The light was extinguished.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator retrieved the tortoise shell, and the other one then swooped downwards.</p><p>A moment later, this person returned, having obtained some unknown treasure from within. The two seemed to exchange a few words, then headed towards the depths of the Boundless Valley, quickly disappearing.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi only dared to emerge from the hillside after confirming the two Nascent Soul cultivators were long gone.</p><p>"Senior, did you recognize the identities of those two Nascent Soul cultivators?" Qin Sang asked, glancing sideways.</p><p>It was unclear if the two cultivators were deliberately concealing their identities. Not only were they shrouded in black robes, but they also didn't use any incantations when breaking the restriction. Only when the one cultivator became impatient with the clinging light did he reveal the tortoise shell, which might offer a clue to their identities.</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head with a wry smile.</p><p>"Brother Qin, you overestimate this old Daoist. With my meager cultivation, I can only listen to rumors. How could I possibly know the secrets of the Nascent Soul level?</p><p>"However, the true Nascent Soul experts in our Little Cold Realm are few and far between. I've heard that the relationships between them aren't harmonious. I wonder what treasure could make two Nascent Soul cultivators join forces...</p><p>"Forget it, these matters have nothing to do with us, nor are they something we can pry into. Fortunately, those two Nascent Soul cultivators' route is opposite to ours. Let's continue on our way."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, glanced back, and followed Yun Youzi, still replaying the earlier battle in his mind.</p><p>Due to the numerous dangers and their weak strength, they traveled slowly.</p><p>After another half a day passed.</p><p>Rounding a ravine, Yun Youzi's face lit up with a hint of joy as he stopped. "Brother Qin, we're here."</p><p>In front of them appeared a small patch of dense jungle, a rare sight in the fragmented inner valley.</p><p>Qin Sang's tense nerves relaxed slightly as he carefully observed the scene.</p><p>There were only a few towering trees in the jungle, mostly consisting of shrubs about a person's height, allowing one to see through to the other side. It was eerily quiet, without even the sound of insects, as if no living creatures resided within.</p><p>"This is actually an ingenious illusion, but if you don't find the way to break it, all of this is real!"</p><p>Yun Youzi said admiringly, striding down and expertly navigating the jungle, not hesitant to touch the plants.</p><p>An illusion?</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. He reached out and snapped a twig, and milky-white sap flowed out, emitting a grassy fragrance. It felt completely real!</p><p>Yun Youzi stopped in the middle of the jungle, his eyes scanning, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>A moment later, Yun Youzi's gaze fixed on something. He walked to an ancient tree and crouched down, looking at an inconspicuous small plant growing at its base.</p><p>He raised his hand, covering the small plant, and spiritual energy surged from his palm, pouring into it.</p><p>The next moment, the jungle vanished, and the scenery abruptly changed!</p><p>...</p><p>A mountain, split in two, formed a valley.</p><p>The break was as smooth as a mirror, making one wonder if the mountain had been cleaved by a single strike.</p><p>Countless flowers grew in the valley.</p><p>These flowers, each with different colors and shapes, were all blooming at the same time and in full bloom.  They formed a sea of flowers, dancing in the gentle breeze.</p><p>At this time, a figure in a gray robe and a bamboo hat was walking through the flower sea.</p><p>Facing these delicate and vibrant flowers, the gray-robed figure showed no sign of appreciating the beautiful scenery. His expression was extremely serious, as if the flower sea concealed man-eating beasts.</p><p>He even swiftly dodged when the flowers brushed against each other, releasing pollen, careful not to let any of it touch him.</p><p>This person, who had been in the flower sea for an unknown amount of time, seemed to understand the flowers very well, his dodging and weaving movements practiced and precise.</p><p>Just then, the gray-robed figure seemed to have touched something, and a flower beside him suddenly transformed into a fierce ghost, opening its bloody maw and biting down with sharp fangs.</p><p>The gray-robed figure reacted swiftly, retreating explosively.  As he retreated, he struck out with both palms, sending out streams of spiritual energy.</p><p>This spiritual energy didn't harm the pursuing ghost but gently suppressed and soothed it until the ghost's eyes grew hazy, and it transformed back into a flower.</p><p>The gray-robed figure expertly resolved the crisis. Just as he was about to continue forward, he seemed to sense something and looked up, staring at the multicolored sky in the distance.</p><p>A surprised expression appeared on his face.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, the figure transformed into a wisp of blue smoke, flying out of the flower sea and disappearing into the depths of the layered restrictions.</p><p>Only a surprised murmur remained, slowly fading away.</p><p>"Heart-Devouring Worm?"</p>
