<h1>Chapter 1179: The Invasion</h1><p>These past few days, he’d been monitoring the situation.  Perhaps related to the emergence of the Ziwei Palace, the activities of the Evil Abyss seemed to be truly winding down.  Reports from Sandie Pass and other areas confirmed this; only minor skirmishes were occurring.</p><p>However, this very calm made him even more cautious.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the tall building.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely focused.</p><p>The killing talisman had been successfully imprinted onto his sword spirit. The next step was the fusion of the sword spirit with his seven souls.</p><p>Soul… soul…</p><p>While frequently used in conversation, in the context of present-day cultivators, it was essentially the same as the primordial spirit or divine soul. Some soul-splitting techniques merely created a fragment from the primordial spirit.</p><p>Truly understanding the three souls and seven spirits, however, remained a profound mystery to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had encountered various interpretations in Xuanmen scriptures.</p><p>Some Daoist texts described the three souls as Taiguang, Shuangling, and Youjing. The seven spirits were described as Shigou, Fushi, Queyin, Tunzei, Feidu, Chuhei, and Choufei – essentially the impure spirits within the body.</p><p>But all of this remained confined to scripture and myth; he had never seen any related cultivation methods.</p><p>Fusing each sword spirit with one of the seven spirits was unheard of.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t know where to begin, so he focused his mind, repeatedly running his cultivation technique, sensing a faint connection, and gradually merging the sword spirits according to the technique’s guidance.</p><p>The process was slow and filled with setbacks.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was incredibly patient.</p><p>Days turned into weeks.</p><p>Undisturbed, Qin Sang diligently cultivated in the tall building. Finally, he made progress – one sword spirit showed signs of merging with his primordial spirit.</p><p>The process then accelerated; the second sword spirit displayed similar signs.</p><p>“It seems they’re all merging with my primordial spirit, but the power of the fusion with these two sword spirits feels slightly different…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>He had a vague sense of this, yet couldn't articulate it.</p><p>“Unless this technique is just using the name, otherwise, the three souls and seven spirits might actually exist!  Does the underworld, the Yellow Springs, Yama, and even reincarnation and transmigration, exist beyond legend…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a long time, then slowly shook his head. Even if they existed, they were far beyond his reach.</p><p>He dismissed these thoughts, about to resume his cultivation, when a rapid bell sound startled him, causing his expression to slightly change.</p><p>The ringing of the cold bell signified an emergency.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly stopped his cultivation, pushed open the door of his chamber, and found Si Di and Jing Lin already there, both with serious expressions.</p><p>“Several watchtowers have reported increased activity by Evil Abyss cultivators. This time it doesn't seem like a feint. I’ve ordered a full retreat…”</p><p>Jing Lin explained softly, relaying all the intelligence to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside the tall building, where streaks of escaping light were flashing, as the army began to assemble.</p><p>“Are you two planning to defend Sandie Pass?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Si Di nodded. “We’re still unclear about the Evil Abyss’s intentions. Are they, as Daoist Zhen predicted, planning a desperate attack before the emergence of the Ziwei Palace, or are they just their usual tactics? The safest option is to defend within the pass, wait for news from Shiqu Mountain, and clarify the situation before making a decision.”</p><p>Jing Lin added: “We also worry that a rash attack might lead us into an Evil Abyss trap. Daoist Si Di will organize the troops. While I would usually control the Cold Bell Formation, with Daoist Mingyue here, I can operate from behind the scenes and surprise the enemy at the opportune moment!”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang understood their strategy.</p><p>Sandie Pass was second only in importance to Shiqu Mountain and other locations. The Cold Bell Formation was exceptionally complex and required a Nascent Soul cultivator to fully utilize its power.</p><p>Two Nascent Soul cultivators, one commanding the center, the other leading the army – freeing up one person would allow for a surprise attack that could severely cripple an Evil Abyss Nascent Soul cultivator, essentially securing victory.</p><p>This was precisely what Qin Sang had agreed to before arriving.</p><p>However, after some thought, Qin Sang offered a suggestion, “Do you have any way to operate the Cold Bell Formation without me? I’d also like to go out and see the Evil Abyss Nascent Soul cultivator's abilities firsthand.”</p><p>“You’re willing to personally participate in the battle?”</p><p>The two were overjoyed.</p><p>They knew the terms of their agreement and didn't expect these demon kings to help without reward.</p><p>Qin Sang’s willingness to fight was unexpected.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “If the Evil Abyss succeeds, our demon race will likely suffer as well. I’ve long wanted to contribute. I have confidence in my escape techniques, even if I'm outmatched, I can still ensure my safety.”</p><p>The two exchanged glances.</p><p>Si Di mused, “I’ll go out to draw one opponent, the two of you will stay hidden, attack unexpectedly, and we might be able to kill their Nascent Soul cultivator together!”</p><p>In the war of the three realms, few Nascent Soul cultivators had perished on the battlefield.</p><p>Each Nascent Soul cultivator is cunning and cautious, and even more importantly,  a Nascent Soul possesses the ability to teleport after leaving the body, making it incredibly difficult to restrain them.</p><p>The three alliance leaders of the Canglang Sea were simply unlucky to encounter that unpredictable ancient demon; otherwise, even if they lost their physical bodies, their Nascent Souls could have escaped.</p><p>“Even if we can’t kill the Nascent Soul, destroying their physical body will weaken Zu Yuan's strength! Finding a suitable new body won't be easy for him, and his power will undoubtedly be greatly reduced. If we succeed, we will certainly recommend Mingyue for merit!”</p><p>Jing Lin’s face was full of joy.</p><p>Si Di remained calm, pointing out a difficulty. “While the array instruments can be entrusted to Foundation Establishment cultivators, the grand array is extremely complex.  There’s a significant difference in power between us operating it and a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  Zu Yuan has been familiar with the Hanling Grand Array for years; deceiving them won’t be easy. If they detect any irregularities, they will undoubtedly be prepared.”</p><p>“You’re right, we need to consider this carefully.”</p><p>Jing Lin's joy subsided. After pondering for a while, he said, “Initially, the Hanling Grand Array was primarily defensive. Zu Yuan didn't commit all his forces, so any changes in the array's performance wouldn't be obvious.”</p><p>Si Di hesitated. “That window of opportunity is too short. I doubt we'll find a chance.”</p><p>“Regardless, it’s worth a try. Even if we can’t kill their Nascent Soul, without affecting the overall battle, I can kill a few Foundation Establishment cultivators first, then return to control the Hanling Grand Array. That would still help you…”</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>His primary goal was to get close to Zu Yuan’s Nascent Soul.</p><p>The three-headed, six-armed ancient demon shadow that ambushed him had been a constant shadow in Qin Sang’s heart.</p><p>If Zu Yuan truly had ties to the ancient demon, he would need to prepare a retreat strategy and plan accordingly.</p><p>The three discussed numerous details and finalized their plan.</p><p>Jing Lin secretly summoned a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator, a junior from his sect, entrusted him with the array instruments, and gave detailed instructions to maintain a perfect disguise.</p><p>Then Si Di went out to deploy troops and await Zu Yuan’s main force.</p><p>******</p>
