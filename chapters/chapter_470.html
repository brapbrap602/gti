<h1>Chapter 463: An Inauspicious Start</h1><p>Vision returned, growing clearer.</p><p>Qin Sang could finally see things other than white light.</p><p>Deep within the white light, the scenery shifted.</p><p>A smooth, mirror-like grayish-white stone, embedded in the mountain, formed a steep cliff face. In the center of the gray stone was a deep groove, from which a white line shot out – a waterfall.</p><p>The waterfall impacted a sizable pool below. To the left of the pool was a stone pavilion, perfectly positioned at the edge of the waterfall's mist.</p><p>Sitting in the pavilion, one could enjoy tea and admire the scenery.</p><p>Unfortunately, half of the pavilion had collapsed. Stone slabs had smashed the stone table and chairs below, scattering rubble everywhere, a scene of utter ruin.</p><p>Surrounding the pool was a vast meadow, lush with green grass and vibrant flowers. The meadow was completely visible, tranquil, without a single creature in sight.</p><p>Towering ancient trees formed a dense forest around the meadow, completely enclosing it. Only a small stone path led into the forest, disappearing among the ancient trees.</p><p>The scene he could see was only a tiny, insignificant part of Skyreach Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless, committing every detail to memory.  He expected to land somewhere in that vicinity.</p><p>After clearly observing the waterfall, meadow, and surrounding scenery, Qin Sang's expression suddenly changed.</p><p>This forest was unusual.</p><p>At the tops of the ancient trees, countless multicolored, irregularly shaped rays of light connected, forming a canopy.  Among these rays of light were scattered crystal-clear orbs.</p><p>The number of orbs was far less than the rays of light, but the orbs emitted a pure starlight, seemingly possessing a purifying effect, making them hard to ignore.</p><p>These orbs and the multicolored light were intertwined, inseparable.</p><p>Qin Sang learned from Vice-Island Master Xiao that Star Essence Stones came from these orbs.</p><p>There were many orbs in the forest. Qin Sang should have been excited, but he wasn't happy at all. His expression became grave.</p><p>Those rays of light were not ordinary. Even before truly encountering them, Qin Sang could sense the extreme danger they emanated, alarming him.</p><p>They were what Vice-Island Master Xiao had described: remnants of ancient restrictions within Skyreach Peak.  Rushing into them would surely lead to a gruesome death.</p><p>Due to various reasons, the space within Skyreach Peak was highly unstable, as were the remaining restrictions. Some fragments of the restrictions still held terrifying power, triggered by the slightest touch, and were incredibly difficult to overcome.  Caution was paramount.</p><p>However, the multicolored light was directly below him, and the forest seemed endless. If he fell naturally, he would inevitably land within the forest and collide with the light.</p><p>Certain death!</p><p>Qin Sang gasped. This was the danger of Skyreach Peak. If one was unlucky and lacked sufficient strength, death was the only outcome.</p><p>He didn't want his journey to end before it truly began. Granny Jing's wooden carving remained motionless, so he could only rely on himself.</p><p>He absolutely couldn't fall into the forest. Only the pool and the meadow seemed relatively safe.</p><p>The chaotic suction force tumbled his body. Relying on his memory, he noted the positions of the meadow and the pool, and his own position relative to them.</p><p>Then, he opened his right hand, revealing the Yin-Yang Compass he had been clutching.</p><p>He was fortunate. The compass was perfectly suited for this situation.</p><p>The compass shimmered.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated in his mind. When a surge of suction appeared, the Yin-Yang Compass suddenly emitted a black magnetic light, a repulsive force that partially neutralized the other suction.  Qin Sang used all his strength to propel himself, borrowing the remaining suction to shift his body several meters closer to the meadow.</p><p>Black and white magnetic light flickered repeatedly, alternating back and forth.</p><p>Qin Sang focused most of his attention on the compass, leaving only a small amount of spiritual energy to maintain his Azure Robe.  As a result, the robe's power greatly diminished. Under the strain of the chaotic suction, its luster faded, and small cracks began to appear.</p><p>Seeing his precious magical artifact about to be destroyed, Qin Sang disregarded everything else.</p><p>Fortunately, his efforts weren't in vain.</p><p>As Qin Sang plummeted, he gradually adjusted his direction, getting closer and closer to the meadow. Finally, at the last possible moment, he cleared the edge of the forest, narrowly avoiding a ray of multicolored light, and crashed down!</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Grass and dirt flew everywhere.</p><p>A deep crater formed in the meadow.</p><p>Qin Sang scrambled up, looking up at the restriction he had nearly touched, his heart pounding.</p><p>Seeing that the light remained inactive, he finally relaxed.</p><p>Without time to celebrate, he circulated his spiritual energy, shaking off the grass and dirt, and hurriedly checked his Azure Robe.</p><p>More than a dozen crisscrossing cracks marred the robe, a truly sorry sight. Fortunately, it wasn't completely destroyed. With the right materials, it could be repaired.</p><p>He put away the robe and donned a lower-quality one.</p><p>Vice-Island Master Xiao had mentioned one advantage of Skyreach Peak: there were no living creatures.  No ferocious beasts or ancient beasts roamed the mountain. The only danger was the omnipresent restriction fragments.</p><p>That's why he dared to stand there openly.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to examine his surroundings when he suddenly felt the wooden carving on his chest move.</p><p>The carving flew out on its own.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang felt a weight on his right shoulder. The carving had settled there.</p><p>He turned his head. The carving had come to life, sitting on his shoulder, and nodding slightly to him.</p><p>The carving now looked exactly like a miniature version of Granny Jing, smaller than Qin Sang's palm.  Her ethereal aura remained, but the overall impression was different.</p><p>She looked like a serious little adult, almost cute…</p><p>A powerful being was right before him, capable of crushing him with a single finger.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not entertain any disrespectful thoughts and quickly cleared his mind.</p><p>"I need to fully suppress my cultivation and must borrow your assistance to travel…" Granny Jing's cold voice sounded. Qin Sang gave a soft "Mm-hmm" in response. Seeing Granny Jing sitting in a meditative posture, eyes slightly closed, he knew she was sensing the direction and quietly surveyed the surroundings.</p><p>He only had one hour.</p><p>In an hour, the suction force above would disappear briefly. The opportunity was fleeting.  Afterward, Skyreach Peak would close again, and if missed, they might be trapped forever.</p><p>The meadow where he landed was safe, but there were no orbs above.  All the orbs in this area were trapped within the forest's restrictions.</p><p>To collect Star Essence Stones, he had to navigate the gaps between the restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but ask, "Senior, are the Star Essence Stones in this forest easy to collect? It would be great if we could take all of them."</p><p>Granny Jing opened her eyes and nodded.  "With the Star Net, collecting these Star Essence Stones is not difficult, and there are quite a few. However, we cannot take them all."</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously, "Why not?"</p>
