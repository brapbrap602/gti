Chapter 598: Three Lights Jade Liquid


The raised platform was clear of debris and showed no obvious mechanisms. Most noticeable were the several jade pillars, all damaged to varying degrees, with clear breaks and many dragon and phoenix carvings missing halves.  A tremendous battle had clearly taken place in the Assembly Hall.

The platform itself suffered the most damage, bearing the scars of a terrifying impact.  Numerous large cracks crisscrossed its surface, with many areas shattered. Only the immortal prohibition prevented its complete collapse.

However, the prohibition was now extremely weak, severely damaged, its power barely perceptible.  It was unclear whether this was a result of the battle or if the prohibition, damaged and unable to sustain itself, had weakened over countless years.

If it was due to time, the platform would likely collapse within a few millennia. Then, anyone entering the Assembly Hall would easily find it, without such elaborate efforts.

As Qin Sang pondered this, his gaze swept across the jade pillars, finding nothing unusual.  His eyes then fell upon an indentation on the platform, where he suddenly sensed a strange fluctuation.

It emanated from within!

Yun Youzi, looking at the same spot, noticed it too.  Had the prohibition been intact, their cultivation wouldn't have allowed them to perceive it. But now, with the prohibition nearing collapse, the internal fluctuation was no longer concealed.

Exchanging a glance, they moved simultaneously.

Qin Sang activated his Corpse Core, soaring above the platform on his Ebony Sword.  Like a bolt of lightning, the sword descended, its Qi dividing into countless strands, resembling tassels.

With the platform exposed by Qin Sang's Heavenly Dipper Steps, the prohibition was revealed. Though they lacked the ability to break it, finding a few weaknesses was not difficult.

'Boom!'

Triggered by the sword Qi, the prohibition appeared, and the platform trembled.  Qin Sang, with calm focus and sharp eyes, instantly pinpointed the weak points.  His hand clenched in the air, condensing the sword Qi into several beams of light that precisely struck those points.

'Thud! Thud!'

The sword Qi penetrated the prohibition.

Instantly, the Assembly Hall was filled with radiant light. The prohibition vibrated intensely, and a vast spiritual wave erupted, surging skyward towards Qin Sang.

Even in its weakened state, the prohibition's counterattack was fierce.

Qin Sang's expression shifted. Without hesitation, he used the Sword Qi Thunderclap technique, transforming into a flash of lightning to evade the attack.

'Whoosh!'

The spiritual wave narrowly missed him.

Yun Youzi, poised and waiting for his opportunity, sprang into action as the wave appeared.  Working seamlessly with Qin Sang, he rushed towards the indentation.  Gathering spiritual power in his palm, he seized the chance to destroy a restriction beside it.

Then, he quickly retreated.

'Hum!'

The platform trembled even more violently, followed by faint cracking sounds from within.

Moments later, the indentation began to rise, revealing a jade pillar beneath, similar to the others outside.

Unexpectedly, as the pillar fully emerged, a hidden compartment was revealed beneath it, containing a tilted jade bottle.

A flash of green light appeared.

With a click, the bottle rolled out of the compartment, capturing Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's attention.

The bottle was small, fitting comfortably in one hand.  Transparent itself, it contained a small amount of emerald liquid, staining the bottle green.  There appeared to be about a dozen drops.

The moment the bottle appeared, Qin Sang felt an incredibly rich life force and abundant spiritual energy. He inhaled deeply, feeling intoxicated.

Even the surrounding plants leaned towards the bottle, their stems and leaves swaying as if dancing.

What miraculous liquid!

Qin Sang marveled.

"Three Lights Jade Liquid! It truly is Three Lights Jade Liquid!"

Yun Youzi murmured, his eyes filled with uncontainable excitement.

"Senior, let's divide this Three Lights Jade Liquid equally," Qin Sang offered, suppressing his own excitement.

He wasn't greedy.  Even half the liquid would be enough for the Nine Phantasmal Orchid's transformation, with some left over for emergencies.

Unexpectedly, Yun Youzi refused. "Three drops are enough for me.  Taking more would not be beneficial, but might instead foster complacency and weaken my resolve. It would be detrimental! Take the rest, younger brother. If I ever need it, I can ask you, and you won't refuse, will you?"

He looked at Qin Sang with a smile.

Qin Sang chuckled. "If you ever need it, Senior, feel free to take it.  The other spirit herbs from the Hanging Garden were divided among the Nascent Soul cultivators, and I won't get any more.  As precious as it is, the Three Lights Jade Liquid is just a healing medicine, not much more valuable than the Ten Thousand Year Spirit Milk."

Yun Youzi nodded. With the Hanging Garden plundered, the primary use of the Three Lights Jade Liquid was gone. He took the bottle, retrieved another from his storage pouch, poured out three drops, and handed the jade bottle back to Qin Sang.

A cool sensation emanated from the bottle.  With a gentle shake, the liquid within shimmered, exuding an even stronger life force.  Qin Sang couldn't resist taking a few sniffs.

After Yun Youzi took his share, about ten drops remained.

Qin Sang sealed the bottle and, for added safety, placed a restriction on it to prevent the life force from leaking, then stored it in his Qianjun Ring.

After securing the Three Lights Jade Liquid, they thoroughly searched the platform, confirming the absence of the Assembly Bowl before giving up.

â€¦

Above the forest.

The two figures that had vanished reappeared briefly, then disappeared again in a flash. Hidden within the canopy, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi cautiously scanned their surroundings, ensuring no one was watching before moving.

Such caution was necessary.

The Purple Subtlety Palace was filled with Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators.  They were at the bottom of the food chain, and a moment of carelessness could spell disaster.

Emerging from the canopy, they changed direction, Qin Sang following closely behind Yun Youzi.

Their destination was near the Ancient Herb Garden. According to Yun Youzi, it might have been an ancient alchemy site, containing something that could aid his recovery.

"We're here!"

They traveled at top speed, reaching a mountain in no time.

Yun Youzi put away his Spirit Bamboo flying boat and pointed to the summit. "It's there."

The mountain was steep and shrouded in mist, with faint outlines of palaces visible, mostly in ruins like the Assembly Hall.

Most striking was a chasm on the eastern side, stretching from peak to base like a narrow passage.  The other side of the chasm leaned outwards, on the verge of collapse.  Clearly not a natural formation, it was a sword scar!

A single sword stroke had split the mountain.

Senior Green Bamboo had done similar feats, but this sword scar still radiated a terrifying sword Qi, far beyond Senior Green Bamboo's capabilities.
