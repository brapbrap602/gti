<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1275: Purification</p><p>Jingyu was deeply concerned for her child.</p><p>She asked Qin Sang to bestow a name upon the plump chicken, hoping to maintain this bond of goodwill.</p><p>However, even though Qin Sang was no ordinary figure, she did not wish for her child to become someone else's mount, losing its freedom.</p><p>In comparison, the status of a mountain-guarding spirit beast was more akin to that of an honorary elder, with far fewer restrictions. They only needed to step forward when the sect faced a crisis.</p><p>She had carefully inquired about Qin Sang's background from the plump chicken and learned that he had only recently formed his Nascent Soul, yet his strength was already formidable. His future prospects were boundless. Who would dare provoke the Green Goat Temple?</p><p>Such situations were likely rare.</p><p>As long as it did not hinder her own cultivation and she could receive offerings from the Green Goat Temple, it was entirely acceptable.</p><p>Jingyu's words aligned perfectly with Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>Qin Sang had initially worried that Jingyu, having enjoyed freedom for so long, might be unwilling to be bound. Seeing that she was not averse to the idea, he nodded inwardly and said, "It would be a slight to ask you to serve as a mountain-guarding spirit beast. If you are unwilling to return to the Boundless Valley, why not establish your abode in the Thousand Bamboo Sea? As a human, I previously concealed my identity with a secret technique. Now that it is exposed, it would be inconvenient for me to intervene in the future. Once I establish the Green Goat Temple, I will invite you to take the position of an honorary elder. How does that sound?"</p><p>He then briefly explained the origins of Wandering Master and their relationship to Jingyu.</p><p>Jingyu was visibly surprised. "You and the Bamboo Demon Senior actually have such a connection! I have long heard of his great name, but alas! Very well, I will guard the Thousand Bamboo Sea for you in the future!"</p><p>Jingyu readily agreed but adamantly refused to become the master of the Thousand Bamboo Sea. The spirits of the Thousand Bamboo Sea would still regard Qin Sang as their master.</p><p>The relationships were tangled, but fortunately, they were resolved amicably.</p><p>Qin Sang was quite pleased to have successfully persuaded Jingyu to stay.</p><p>Qin Sang, upholding Wandering Master's last wish, established the Green Goat Temple. However, he himself had to travel to search for fragments of the Slaughtering Sword. The sect was newly founded, its foundation shallow, and it could easily collapse. With Jingyu's protection, he could rest assured.</p><p>The plump chicken, seeing the matter resolved satisfactorily and its mother unharmed, was overjoyed.</p><p>Having followed Qin Sang for many years, it had long been convinced of his capabilities and saw no issue in acknowledging him as its master. Since its mother had decided, it could only obey.</p><p>"Chile, go to the Thousand Bamboo Sea and send a message to the Triple Pass. Summon the White Crane, White Cat, Old Horse Monkey, and Willow Demon to the Thousand Bamboo Sea to await my instructions. I have matters to discuss," Qin Sang remembered something and, in front of Jingyu, unceremoniously ordered the plump chicken.</p><p>Seeing her mother smiling at her, the plump chicken immediately obeyed and left.</p><p>...</p><p>The restrictions of the cave abode were disturbed once more.</p><p>This time, it was Elder Xun from the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Qin!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang emerge, Elder Xun hurriedly performed a grand salute.</p><p>Upon returning from the Boundless Valley, Qing Jun had summoned her disciples and publicly announced Qin Sang's true identity.</p><p>The entire Yuan Shen Sect was shaken, only then realizing that the mysterious Elder Qin was already a Nascent Soul Patriarch. Although Qing Jun explained that Qin Sang was only temporarily residing in the Yuan Shen Sect, they were still overjoyed.</p><p>"Senior Qin, these are the spiritual materials you requested. I have personally gathered them all."</p><p>Elder Xun handed over a spatial pouch. Qin Sang's divine sense swept over it, confirming that all the materials needed for the formation were present and complete.</p><p>With the materials in hand, Qin Sang called Jingyu and, through the Yuan Shen Sect's forbidden grounds, arrived at the core of the mountain's spiritual vein. This was also the core of the Yuan Shen Sect's mountain-protecting formation.</p><p>He had obtained a jade token from Qing Jun to control the formation. Activating the formation, they entered the cave, where the spiritual energy was palpable, refreshing the mind. In such an environment, there was no sense of darkness.</p><p>Before long, they saw a spiritual lake formed by the spiritual vein, their destination.</p><p>In the entire Yuan Shen Sect, only he and Qing Jun could enter here.</p><p>Outsiders could not possibly intrude, so there was no need to worry about the Corpse Flower Blood Amber being stolen.</p><p>"How does this place look to you?"</p><p>Qin Sang carefully used the Golden Sinking Sword to create a platform at the bottom of the lake without damaging the spiritual vein, then turned and asked.</p><p>Jingyu surveyed the surroundings, sensing for a while, then shook her head. "The quality of this spiritual vein is not the highest. Purifying the Corpse Flower Blood Amber here will likely take more than ten years, possibly up to twenty."</p><p>"An extra ten years is acceptable."</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his sword and sighed. "The spiritual energy in the world is sparse. No spiritual vein can compare to those of ancient times. The Yuan Shen Sect is a top-tier sect in the Cold Domain. In the entire North Star Realm, there are few spiritual veins that surpass this one."</p><p>Even if the major sects did not covet the Corpse Flower Blood Amber, they would certainly not damage their own spiritual veins to help others purify elixirs.</p><p>The Heavenly Demon Ridge was considered a remote area. Wandering Master held a high status among the demons, but the spiritual vein of the Thousand Bamboo Sea was not as good as the Yuan Shen Sect's.</p><p>This was the greatest challenge Qin Sang would face.</p><p>The top spiritual veins in the North Star Realm were mostly claimed. To ensure the long-term prosperity of a sect, a top-tier spiritual vein was a necessary condition. Where should the Green Goat Temple be established?</p><p>Having chosen the location, Qin Sang opened the spatial pouch and took out the spiritual materials.</p><p>The two of them worked together, embedding the materials into the spiritual lake, and soon the outline of a spiritual formation appeared.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, place the Corpse Flower Blood Amber inside."</p><p>Jingyu spoke up.</p><p>With a flash from the Thousand Jun Ring, three jade boxes flew out.</p><p>According to their agreement, Qin Sang received three pieces.</p><p>These three pieces of Corpse Flower Blood Amber varied in size and shape, their texture resembling amber, with the spiritual flowers vibrant as if alive, captured at their most beautiful moment.</p><p>Set against the blood essence, they exuded an eerie allure.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Corpse Flower Blood Amber flew into the spiritual lake.</p><p>Jingyu's hand seals changed rapidly as she embedded the last few spiritual materials into the formation, completing the secret technique.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A stream of light flowed across the lakebed.</p><p>The spiritual formation vanished, replaced by a verdant spiritual plant. Its pure white, flexible roots clung tightly to the platform, the stem slender and straight, growing visibly, branching out, and turning into a small tree. Finally, three flowers bloomed on the crown, the very Corpse Flower Blood Amber Qin Sang had just placed inside.</p><p>The Corpse Flower Blood Amber seemed to truly grow on the spiritual plant, flawless and perfect.</p><p>The spiritual pearls swayed in the spiritual lake, manifestations of the formation's power.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the spiritual plant intently. After a long while, he finally saw a faint trace of blood appear on the pure white roots, barely visible to the naked eye. The blood gradually merged into the spiritual lake, quickly dispersing.</p><p>This was the function of the spiritual plant, using the power of the spiritual vein to meticulously cleanse the blood poison from the Corpse Flower Blood Amber without damaging its medicinal properties. The blood poison dispersed into the spiritual lake, and the spiritual vein's powerful self-purification ability would restore it to normal soon after the purification was complete.</p><p>Confirming that the secret technique was effective, both Qin Sang and Jingyu breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The Corpse Flower Blood Amber was extremely rare, and Jingyu was using it for the first time. Fortunately, the inherited knowledge of her clan was accurate.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang summoned several small triangular flags and planted them around the spiritual plant.</p><p>This was the protective formation Qin Sang had prepared.</p><p>A ripple of water waves spread, and the small flags shone brightly, then transformed into a light barrier covering the entire platform, making the spiritual plant disappear from sight.</p><p>They retraced their steps, planning to return in twenty years to retrieve the elixir.</p>
