<h1>Chapter 1911: The Abyss of Fallen Souls</h1><p>From afar, one could see flames flickering above Fire Origin Valley.</p><p>Countless points of firelight resembled stars scattered across the valley floor.</p><p>Qin Sang saw through the illusion at a glance. These flames weren't naturally occurring but manifestations of a formation's power.</p><p>Having received Yu Daozi's plea for help, Patriarch Guan hadn't ventured out to rescue him, nor had he fled. Instead, he had arrayed a formation within his cultivation grounds, waiting in tranquility.</p><p>A streak of escaping light, swift as a meteor, approached Fire Origin Valley.</p><p>Those within the valley sensed the hostile aura, and the myriad firelights flickered uneasily.</p><p>"Which fellow Daoist graces my humble abode?"</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Qin Sang landed at the valley's entrance, his voice carrying into Fire Origin Valley, "This humble Daoist is Qing Feng. Are you the Patriarch Guan that Yu Daozi spoke of?"</p><p>Within the valley.</p><p>Upon an exposed crimson stone sat a strange man.  The parts of his head, face, and hands that were visible were completely bald, devoid of a single hair.</p><p>His rough skin was covered in bizarre scars, as if seared by fire, and wisps of black energy occasionally surfaced on the scars' surface.</p><p>Whenever black energy spread across a certain area, the flesh there would twitch, a faint bloody hue flashing as it suppressed the dark energy.</p><p>This man was Patriarch Guan!</p><p>He opened his withered eyelids, looked towards the valley entrance, and spoke in a raspy voice, "It seems Daoist Priest has already slain Yu Daozi. Well done!"</p><p>"Oh? Does Your Excellency know why this humble Daoist eliminated Yu Daozi?"</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the valley entrance, hands clasped behind his back, his gaze sweeping across the myriad firelights.</p><p>"Heh heh…"</p><p>Patriarch Guan's laughter was sharp as a ghostly wail, adding a layer of eerieness to Fire Origin Valley. "Regardless of the reason, that wretch overestimated himself, provoking Daoist Priest. His death is justified!  Keeping such a fool alive would only bring me greater trouble. That's why I say Daoist Priest did well!"</p><p>"Your Excellency is also a decisive person."</p><p>Qin Sang looked directly into Fire Origin Valley. "It seems those who secretly pledged allegiance to you aren't limited to Yu Daozi. Losing a single Nascent Soul late-stage cultivator doesn't seem to affect Your Excellency much. No wonder undercurrents surge in the cultivation world, and the sand bandit menace grows increasingly rampant."</p><p>A grand formation separated the two.</p><p>Yet Patriarch Guan felt Qin Sang's gaze, sharp as a sword, pierce through the formation's barrier and land upon him.</p><p>His pupils abruptly contracted. After a moment of silence, he countered, "Having arrived in the Fire Region, I've heard of various sect experts, but I've never heard of a Daoist Priest Qing Feng. May I inquire which sect's Patriarch you are?"</p><p>"No sect, no school. I wander as I cultivate," Qin Sang replied indifferently.</p><p>Patriarch Guan was momentarily speechless.</p><p>If he truly were a wandering cultivator, would he come looking for trouble without reason?</p><p>Upon learning of Yu Daozi's sudden demise, Patriarch Guan had speculated that perhaps he had overstepped his boundaries somewhere, incurring the displeasure of the three major sects of the Fire Region, and this was a warning.</p><p>Prior to this, Patriarch Guan had anticipated that no matter how cautious he was, since he had interfered, this day would eventually come.</p><p>He believed that as long as he acted intelligently and understood the rules, the three major sects, with their vast resources, wouldn't choose a life-or-death struggle with a Soul Formation mid-stage cultivator.</p><p>Patriarch Guan assumed Qin Sang was a reclusive Patriarch from one of the three major sects, perhaps concerned about his descendants facing retribution and unwilling to reveal his identity.</p><p>"Sand bandits, being sand bandits, won't leave the desert. Some are indeed lawless, daring to disobey even my commands. Rest assured, Daoist Priest, those reckless fellows will be dealt with.</p><p>"As for the turmoil in the cultivation world, Daoist Priest exaggerates.</p><p>"The three major sects are the overlords of the Fire Region. I am but a lone cultivator. How dare I challenge their authority? In truth, some, yearning for the Great Dao, actively sought my patronage. Some even harbor malicious intentions, exploiting my name for their own gain. I've been in secluded cultivation for many years and was deceived by these scoundrels.</p><p>"If any of Daoist Priest's descendants are among them, I will immediately sever ties and extinguish their hopes.</p><p>"However, those who genuinely strive for progress, vowing to follow me and seek the Immortal Dao together, cannot all be turned away.</p><p>"Isn't that so?"</p><p>Patriarch Guan, having prepared his speech in advance, displayed weakness while subtly hinting at his own power. His words were watertight.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang knew Patriarch Guan had misunderstood.</p><p>If it were anyone else, merely intending to give Patriarch Guan a warning, they would be satisfied with such a response.</p><p>Unfortunately for Patriarch Guan, he had encountered Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang dispensed with further pleasantries and raised his right hand.</p><p>Instantly, thunder rumbled in the clear sky, and dark clouds gathered above Fire Origin Valley. The myriad firelights flickered with increasing intensity.</p><p>"You!"</p><p>Patriarch Guan's expression changed drastically. He rapidly considered which words had caused offense, then saw a flash of silver above.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>Heaven-shaking thunder reverberated.</p><p>A point of lightning coalesced at the heart of the thunderclouds.</p><p>All the surrounding lightning was drawn in, and the thunderclouds discharged bolts of lightning that danced wildly.</p><p>Spiritual Qi surged, and countless electric serpents and thunder dragons weaved through the thunderclouds, forming a vast net that covered the sky.</p><p>The point of lightning at the center seemed to possess an infinite attractive force, drawing in the surrounding lightning bolts.</p><p>Like rivers converging into the sea, the light grew increasingly blinding, transforming into a mystical thunder seal hanging high in the sky, its inscriptions flickering in and out of existence.</p><p>This scene bore some resemblance to when he had borrowed the power of the Thunder Ancestor to cast the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal within the Talisman World, but its power was far less than it had been then.</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>Patriarch Guan was terrified.</p><p>With a crack, the surrounding mountains, including Fire Origin Valley, became vividly clear.</p><p>The thunder seal unleashed terrifying lightning, striking down like a heavenly thunderbolt!</p><p>The myriad firelights floating above Fire Origin Valley froze in that instant, then shook violently as large swathes of them were extinguished.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The mountains trembled.</p><p>The Fire Origin Valley formation was shattered by the thunderstrike, riddled with breaches.</p><p>Patriarch Guan abruptly stood, his cold eyes filled with terror. He opened his mouth and spewed a cloud of blood mist.</p><p>A pungent, bloody stench filled Fire Origin Valley.  Within the blood mist floated countless pale skulls and contorted ghostly figures.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The blood mist exploded, transforming into a blood cloud.  The skulls and specters tumbled within the blood mist, emitting mournful wails. Judging by their lingering auras, they had all been cultivators in life.</p><p>Having expelled the blood mist, black Qi surged throughout Patriarch Guan's body, his aura in disarray.</p><p>He forcibly suppressed the black energy, attempting to use the blood mist to block the lightning.  He formed a hand seal, his figure flickering as he tried to escape underground.</p><p>Just then, a five-colored stream of light shot from the valley entrance, striking Patriarch Guan directly.</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Light primarily served to bind. He had no time to react, freezing in place, an expression of terror etched on his face.</p><p>Moments later, the thunder subsided, and the thunderclouds gradually dispersed.</p><p>Qin Sang silently reflected on the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal. Having received guidance from the Thunder Ancestor, its power now was incomparable to what it had been.</p><p>The High Divine Firmament Scripture was the core essence of the entire Dao Court's thunder techniques. The deeper his understanding of the scripture, the easier it was to comprehend the Five Thunders Institute's thunder techniques.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang collected himself and, leading Xiao Wu, stepped into the valley. He saw Patriarch Guan, now completely powerless.</p><p>"I was blind and ignorant, failing to recognize a true expert. I'm willing to follow Daoist Priest and serve you from now on!" Patriarch Guan cried out desperately.</p><p>"Do you have a sect behind you? Who instructed you?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Daoist Priest, I was expelled from my sect long ago. I have no sect, no school.  I originally cultivated in Twilight Fall Mountain but was later ambushed by villains and forced to relocate here.  No one instructed me…" Patriarch Guan dared not conceal anything, answering honestly.</p><p>His words carried another implication: taking him in wouldn't incur much karmic debt. It was akin to gaining a capable subordinate for free.</p><p>His enemies were somewhat formidable, but they were definitely no match for this Daoist Priest before him.</p><p>Even ants cling to life.</p><p>Patriarch Guan held a glimmer of hope, but seeing Qin Sang's expression, he sensed something amiss.</p><p>Upon hearing his words, the other party seemed…disappointed?</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, his tone indifferent. "This humble Daoist came to kill Your Excellency, not to negotiate a deal."</p><p>"Why! I have no grudge against you! Why must you kill me!" Patriarch Guan roared furiously.</p><p>He suddenly recalled Qin Sang's previous questions.</p><p>"Just for those sand bandits? Just for those insignificant ants?  You want to uphold justice for the heavens? Uphold justice for the heavens!"</p><p>Patriarch Guan's eyes widened in disbelief, as if looking at a madman. A deep sense of absurdity surged within him, and he burst into maniacal laughter.</p><p>"Haha…"</p><p>"Countless evildoers exist in this world. How many cultivators have no innocent blood on their hands?  Can you kill them all? Are you yourself completely innocent?"</p><p>"Twilight Fall Mountain is teeming with demons. Why don't you go there to uphold justice for the heavens! Do you dare to attack the Abyss of Fallen Souls!"</p><p>His questions echoed through Fire Origin Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly watched Patriarch Guan, extending a finger towards his forehead. He said indifferently, "If necessary, I will…"</p><p>The laughter abruptly ceased.</p><p>Patriarch Guan's aura vanished, his eyes filled with lingering resentment.</p><p>"The Abyss of Fallen Souls…" Qin Sang softly murmured the name.</p><p>As far as he knew, the Abyss of Fallen Souls was the only power in the vicinity that could rival Cloud Capital Heaven, located in the deepest reaches of Twilight Fall Mountain.</p><p>The cultivators of Cloud Capital Mountain considered those of the Abyss of Fallen Souls to be demonic heretics. Yet, over the years, they had coexisted peacefully, demonstrating the Abyss's strength.</p><p>With Twilight Fall Mountain as the boundary, Cloud Capital Mountain cultivators rarely crossed over, and neither side interfered with the other.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's understanding of Cloud Capital Heaven, their Supreme Patriarch was at the Void Refinement stage, but it was unknown whether it was early Void Refinement or higher.</p><p>No one in Cloud Capital Mountain dared defy the Supreme Patriarch's orders, and no one had witnessed him in action. The Supreme Patriarch was the most powerful cultivator in Cloud Capital Heaven, unless there were other hidden Void Refinement cultivators.</p><p>If the Abyss of Fallen Souls was comparable in strength to, or slightly weaker than, Cloud Capital Heaven, Qin Sang wouldn't mind challenging them for the sake of comprehending the Dao of Slaughter.</p><p>However…</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head inwardly.</p><p>He had slaughtered his way from Four Fires Town to Fire Origin Valley, showing no mercy to evildoers, be they Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, or even Nascent Soul and Soul Formation cultivators, yet he still hadn't felt that touch of enlightenment regarding the Great Dao.</p><p>"Expecting to achieve something so soon after descending the mountain is too impatient," Qin Sang reflected.</p><p>The Dao follows nature.</p><p>As the saying goes, searching high and low without finding it, only to have it appear effortlessly.</p><p>Perhaps, without deliberate pursuit, without demanding results, the path would naturally reveal itself.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Xiao Wu, remembering his initial purpose in descending the mountain: to temper Xiao Wu's demonic nature.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he dispersed the resentful spirits within the blood cloud.</p><p>Qin Sang collected Patriarch Guan's belongings, finding quite a few treasures, though none that truly caught his eye.</p><p>However, some of these items could be useful.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced through the various thunder-related treasures recorded in the Five Thunders Emissary Institute Seal.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang and the others left Fire Origin Valley.</p><p>He decided to continue south, but before leaving, he would eliminate Patriarch Guan's remaining followers. Having started this, he would see it through to the end.</p><p>"Next, Frost Snow Palace."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed eastward.</p><p>Two people, a horse, and a bird sped through the night.</p><p>"Give me a share this time!" Zhu Que's disgruntled cry came from the sky.  It hadn't had a chance to act and was growing restless.</p><p>…</p><p>Unlike other sects, Frost Snow Palace's mountain gate was located underground, built around a cold spring.</p><p>Frost Snow Palace cultivated a unique technique that utilized the energy of flames to temper their own Yin-cold cultivation.</p><p>The sect's founder had chosen this location, excavating the ground directly.  Ice palaces, arranged around the cold spring, were neatly arrayed, their icy blue radiance shimmering within the dark underground space, a breathtakingly beautiful sight.</p><p>On this day, Frost Snow Palace was ravaged as if by a devastating firestorm. More than half of the ice palaces had collapsed.</p><p>The disciples huddled in the undamaged areas, looking at their ruined mountain gate and destroyed protective formation, some filled with grief, others with blank stares.</p><p>Everyone could see the list of crimes, etched in blood upon an ice wall, a shocking sight.</p><p>"Cough, cough…"</p><p>Beside the cold spring, two women supported an old woman, her face pale as she coughed incessantly.</p><p>The three women were still shaken.  They had claimed it was an internal matter of Frost Snow Palace, but the person had destroyed their mountain gate without a word.  Fortunately, he had only punished the wicked and hadn't indiscriminately slaughtered the innocent.</p><p>"Red Granny brought this upon herself, implicating the sect.  If she hadn't died today, I wouldn't have spared her either!  Spread the word, no one is to speak of this outside. I'm going to Six Harmonies Sect…"</p><p>…</p><p>Frost Snow Palace, Returning Dragon Cave, Clear Wave Mountain, Three Mountains Bandit Stronghold…</p><p>And various sand bandit groups like the Northern Desert Thirteen Eagles.</p><p>Qin Sang tirelessly targeted them one after another, leaving a trail of blood in the yellow sand wherever he went.</p><p>The sand bandit forces were uprooted.</p><p>…</p><p>Luo Meng Mountain, one of the Three Mountains Bandit Strongholds.</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop the mountain, countless corpses lying at his feet, blood-written accusations covering the surrounding cliff walls.</p><p>"Time to head south…"</p><p>"Daoist Priest has quite a thirst for blood!" A voice suddenly came from afar.</p><p>On another mountaintop outside Luo Meng Mountain, a burly man had appeared at some point.</p><p>The man stood over ten feet tall, with a commanding presence. He wore a fiery red robe inscribed with dense runes, clearly a powerful artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang had long been aware of his arrival.  Looking across the mountains, a strange glint appeared in his eyes. "Does fellow Daoist believe the sand bandits shouldn't be killed? Or do these sand bandits have some connection to you?"</p><p>The man's eyelids twitched. He had personally visited Fire Origin Valley.</p><p>Suppressing the urge to retreat, the man shook his head repeatedly, distancing himself. "Sand bandits plague the world, and everyone has the right to eliminate them! We've long wanted to eradicate them, but we were wary of that devil's power and didn't dare act rashly.  Many thanks to Daoist Priest for removing this scourge for us!"</p><p>Pausing, the man cupped his fists. "This humble one is Fu Xiao of Six Harmonies Sect.  I wonder if I might have the honor of inviting Daoist Priest to our sect as a guest, so that the three major sects of the Fire Region can fulfill our duty as hosts."</p><p>"The three major sects of the Fire Region, I've long admired your reputation. However, this humble Daoist is about to journey elsewhere. We shall meet again if fate allows."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and, leading his horse, prepared to leave.</p><p>Of the three major sects, Six Harmonies Sect's mountain gate was closest to his cultivation grounds.  Clearly, they were still unaware of their new neighbor.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang about to leave, the man inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. After a moment of hesitation, he couldn't help but ask, "Is this…Cloud Capital Heaven's will?"</p><p>He didn't believe Qin Sang was acting purely out of a desire to slay demons and eliminate evil.</p>
