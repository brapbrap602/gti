Chapter 1875: Swordsmanship


“Since Fellow Daoist speaks thus, this humble Daoist will have the audacity to frequently visit True Person Zuo in the future.  Well, as the saying goes, one should keep in touch, haha…”
Qin Sang said, unable to help but chuckle.
True Person Zhijian also smiled and shook his head. “Does Fellow Daoist think that True Person Zuo treats you differently because of our connection? The Grand True Person has discerning eyes that can perceive the finest details. How could their judgment be swayed by outsiders? Since True Person Zuo is courting you, it only means that your abilities are powerful enough to gain the Grand True Person's recognition and esteem. Fellow Daoist shouldn't underestimate yourself.”
Qin Sang took a sip of wine and said, “This humble Daoist won’t underestimate myself, but it’s undeniable that being able to meet True Person Zuo and having them willing to intervene and rescue me from danger has something to do with Fellow Daoist…”
Qin Sang then briefly described the events of seven years ago, when he and True Person Zuo had joined forces to fight against the Demon King.  He objectively described his own strength and the role he played.
Before this, Qin Sang had always concealed his true cultivation level every time he returned to the Star Island Immortal Lake.
After obtaining the *Poison God Classic*, Qin Sang's cultivation speed could be described as astonishing. He wasn't afraid of True Person Zhijian knowing, but rather that the news would reach the Dao Court and be noticed by those with ulterior motives.
Qin Sang understood the principle of ‘a tall tree catches the wind.’  As a rogue cultivator with no backing, he had to be cautious in everything he did.
After the battle at the Altar of Healing, it was impossible to conceal it any longer, but now, his strength and background were completely different.
Qin Sang guessed that after the chaos at the Altar of Healing, True Person Zuo must have contacted True Person Zhijian to inquire about his background.
True Person Zhijian probably already knew.
As expected, after listening to Qin Sang's account, True Person Zhijian didn't appear too surprised.  Gently swirling the wine cup in their hand, they feigned surprise. “As the saying goes, one should look at a person with new eyes after even a short absence. This humble Daoist has been in secluded cultivation for merely a few years, and not only has the outside world undergone dramatic changes, but an old friend has also soared to great heights, almost beyond recognition!  Fellow Daoist possesses the ability to slay Demon Kings; you must have comprehended the Chengying Sword and gained enlightenment in the Sword Dao.  Do you still remember our agreement from back then?  There's no time like the present.  The moonlight is just right; why don't we discuss the Sword Dao tonight?”
Qin Sang was resigned. True Person Zhijian clearly knew what he wanted to ask, but feigned ignorance, constantly changing the subject, likely due to some unspoken difficulty.
Since True Person Zhijian didn't want to speak, Qin Sang didn't press the matter, draining the wine in his cup. “To wield a sword before Fellow Daoist, this humble Daoist needs to make some preparations.  Could we wait for another year?”
Qin Sang hadn’t forgotten his agreement with True Person Zhijian and had always been looking forward to it.
However, he didn't have a suitable spirit sword at hand.
The Grey Warbler Sword wasn't of sufficient grade, and the Cloud Wanderer Sword was currently absorbing Diamond Essence; it should be completed soon.
“Alright, let’s set it for one year from now!”
True Person Zhijian nodded, matching Qin Sang’s drink.  Picking up the wine pot, they gave it a shake and filled both their cups again.
Before they knew it, midnight had arrived.
The two talked about everything under the sun, discussing past and present, and returned home content.
…
Six months later.
Inside the cave dwelling.
Qin Sang was meditating with his eyes closed when he suddenly felt something. Silently activating a sword incantation, the room instantly filled with sword light.
A shimmering sword ray hovered before Qin Sang, revealing the bright and translucent Cloud Wanderer Sword.
It didn't look much different from before, except that the azure light emanating from the spirit sword seemed a bit richer.
However, Qin Sang could sense that the Cloud Wanderer Sword's blade was now indestructible, thanks to the Diamond Essence.
After giving birth to a spirit embryo and advancing to a spirit treasure, the Cloud Wanderer Sword devoured spirit wood at a much faster rate than before.
Both pieces of Diamond Essence had been absorbed by the Cloud Wanderer Sword.  From the day it began absorbing them until now, seven years had passed, though the actual time spent absorbing was only three years.
In the interval between absorbing the two pieces of Diamond Essence, Qin Sang had spent a few years comprehending the changes brought about by the Diamond Essence.
Qin Sang kept his eyes closed, using his divine sense to perceive his natal spirit sword. After a moment, he murmured, “Indeed…”
After absorbing the first piece of Diamond Essence, Qin Sang had discovered that the changes to the spirit embryo weren’t significant.
The second piece was the same.
This showed that absorbing spirit wood only enhanced the spirit sword itself; it could increase the spirit sword's power but couldn't accelerate the Cloud Wanderer Sword's transformation through accumulating spirit wood.
The key to the transformation of a spirit treasure into a Postnatal Spirit Treasure lay in spirituality, in the gestation of a tool spirit within the spirit embryo.
Qin Sang had also learned this when consulting Grandmaster Gu.
In terms of nurturing spirituality, a natal spirit treasure, intertwined with its owner’s life and bloodline, had advantages that other spirit treasures couldn't match.
However, to maintain the purity of a natal spirit treasure and prevent any fissures from appearing between it and its owner, certain refining secret arts that relied on external forces to catalyze spirituality couldn't be crudely applied to a natal spirit treasure and had to be carefully evaluated.
Qin Sang hadn’t learned many secret arts and could only rely on himself to nurture the Cloud Wanderer Sword for now.
He opened his eyes, and the Cloud Wanderer Sword gently turned, its tip pointing directly at Qin Sang's eyes.
At this moment, Qin Sang’s pupils contracted. He felt the sharpness of the sword tip intensely, even feeling a sting, and couldn't help but silently praise it.
…
Six months later, the appointed time had arrived.
The northern region of the Star Island Immortal Lake.
This place had become even more desolate. Cultivators were scrambling to escape into the inner lake to avoid disaster, some even relocating their entire sects, taking the families and mortals affiliated with them.
Mortals with connections were also fleeing south, leaving those who remained to their fate.
Islands became deserted, and though traces of their former prosperity could still be seen, they were now devoid of human life.
Two figures flew through the wind, Qin Sang and True Person Zhijian.
Their escaping lights didn't stop, flying continuously north.  Signs of human habitation became increasingly scarce, and further north, all was desolate.
Flying to a vast expanse of water, True Person Zhijian descended, flicking their finger to send out a sword shadow. It whistled out and returned a moment later.  They nodded slightly. “There's no one within a thousand miles; let's do it here.”
“Alright!”
Qin Sang landed a thousand zhang in front of True Person Zhijian, his feet treading the water’s surface, rising and falling with the gentle ripples.
The two exchanged greetings across the water.
Qin Sang formed a sword incantation, and a sword ray shot out from between his eyebrows, like a dragon emerging.
Stirred by the sword energy, huge waves immediately surged before Qin Sang.
The Cloud Wanderer Sword circled above Qin Sang's head once, then transformed into a startling rainbow, soaring into the heavens. Its sword cry was like thunder, shaking the surroundings.
There were no islands or reefs nearby, but the water wasn't lacking in life. Hearing the thunderous sound, even ordinary fish and shrimp that hadn’t attained sentience felt an instinctive fear, fleeing in schools.
The birds in the sky didn’t dare fly over this area of water.
“A fine sword!”
True Person Zhijian’s gaze followed the Cloud Wanderer Sword, their eyes gleaming with admiration, praising it loudly.
In the next instant, they flicked their sleeve, and a silver light shot out, transforming into a three-foot azure blade, hanging upside down before True Person Zhijian.
Qin Sang had seen this sword before. It was the sword True Person Zhijian had used when they first met in the Star Valley Grotto.
Back then, this sword was only a pseudo-spirit treasure. Now, it had become a true spirit treasure, with two seal characters, ‘Ask Heart,’ engraved on its blade at some point.
But Qin Sang knew that this wasn't True Person Zhijian’s most powerful spirit sword.
Qin Sang asked curiously, “Why not use that sword?”
The sword he referred to was the sheathless spirit sword in True Person Zhijian's cave dwelling, completely wrapped in strips of white cloth inscribed with talismans.
Upon first seeing that sword, it had left a deep impression on Qin Sang, making him curious about its true appearance.
True Person Zhijian knew what Qin Sang was asking and said, “I can't fully control that sword yet, so I left it in the cave dwelling.”
Qin Sang nodded.  Seeing that the Ask Heart Sword hovering in front of True Person Zhijian wasn't moving, he didn’t hold back. With a thought, a clear sword cry came from the sky, followed by the incessant sound of something breaking the air.

‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’

The whistling of swords echoed throughout the heavens and earth.
True Person Zhijian looked up and saw a scene of a myriad sword energies obscuring the sky.  Countless sword shadows, both real and illusory, rained down, covering the entire water surface.
The surroundings had transformed into a forest of swords, offering no escape.
“Fellow Daoist, behold my sword!”
True Person Zhijian shouted softly.
The Ask Heart Sword trembled slightly, its blade turning to point upwards.  In an instant, it vanished.
Qin Sang’s face showed surprise. The moment the Ask Heart Sword disappeared, he lost all sense of it.
Only by using his Heavenly Eye divine ability could he see a sword shadow rising against the rain of sword energy.
And just as the sword shadow was about to collide with the sword energy, even the Heavenly Eye Butterfly lost track of the Ask Heart Sword.

‘Clang!’

A sword cry, distinct from that of the Cloud Wanderer Sword, suddenly rang out.
The sound wasn't loud, almost faint compared to the whistling of the sword energy, yet clearly audible.
At this moment, the whistling of swords seemed to be suppressed by this sword cry.
Immediately after, golden sword glows suddenly appeared in midair, as numerous as the descending sword energy, each sword glow precisely corresponding to a streak of sword energy.
The myriad sword energies and the myriad sword glows collided almost simultaneously, as if heaven and earth were crashing together.

‘Boom!’

Dark clouds filled the sky.
Giant waves surged in the lake.
A blinding sword light erupted between the water and sky, as if transforming into a realm of thunder, making it impossible to see.  The figures of the two were swallowed by the sword light.
Two different, yet equally powerful and terrifying sword intents instantly swept across all directions.
Fortunately, this was a vast expanse of water.  On land, the power of a single strike might have already caused mountains to crumble and rivers to run dry!
At this moment, Qin Sang was enveloped by chaotic sword intent.  His eyes and heart held only the sword.  A thought arose, and just as he was about to change his tactics, a sword cry suddenly rang out within his heart.
This ‘sword cry’ wasn’t a real sound, but a divine ability he had gained from comprehending the Chengying Sword. As the saying went, ‘the sword rises from the heart.’  It would immediately warn him if it sensed any killing intent directed at him.
A strong premonition of danger arose in Qin Sang's heart.  Without hesitation, he recalled the Cloud Wanderer Sword.

‘Swish!’

In an instant, a rainbow of sword light descended from the sky, arriving with a whoosh and slashing at the void beside Qin Sang.
With a ‘clang,’ a sword shadow, unable to strike, was forced out by the Cloud Wanderer Sword.  It was the Ask Heart Sword.
“Not bad!”
True Person Zhijian in the distance nodded slightly, praising him. They seemed to have seen through the reason for the Ask Heart Sword's exposure at a glance.
The Ask Heart Sword trembled slightly, returning without success, not engaging with the Cloud Wanderer Sword. It transformed into a streak of sword light and shot back.
Qin Sang stared at the Ask Heart Sword, but couldn't see how it disappeared or how it had appeared beside him so silently. Knowing that continuing like this would be disadvantageous to him, he didn't hesitate and immediately changed his sword incantation.
The Sword Array emerged!
The sky and earth darkened, then stars suddenly shone brightly, with countless sword stars hanging in the void. The lake water beneath the two disappeared.
At this moment, they seemed to have been pulled into the void, drifting in the starry river.
This time, it was Qin Sang who disappeared.  His true body merged with a sword star, and secretly divided into seven sword souls.
The sword souls each entered one of the Seven Mansions, each presiding over a mansion, one person manifesting the sword array.
True Person Zhijian stood in place, never moving, allowing themselves to be pulled into the sword array.
At this moment, they were positioned right at the center of the sword array, gazing up at the sword stars with profound eyes, as if deducing something.
Qin Sang naturally wouldn't let them decipher the sword array.  He immediately activated it.
True Person Zhijian was situated within the Mao Mansion.  The sword star of the Mao Mansion lit up first, beams of starlight pouring down like a torrent, striking True Person Zhijian.
Simultaneously, starlight flickered from the other six mansions, striking from afar.
Starlight was sword light.
Locked onto by starlight and facing the terrifying sword momentum, True Person Zhijian’s expression remained unchanged. The Ask Heart Sword before them trembled violently, and an immensely powerful sword intent erupted, shattering the sword momentum pressing down upon them.

‘Swish!’

The spirit sword slashed upwards towards the heavens!
The first beam of starlight intersected with the Ask Heart Sword. It was like a solid object, first stagnating, then shattering inch by inch.
True Person Zhijian held one hand behind their back, while the other formed an incantation, pointing towards the void.
The Ask Heart Sword suddenly split into two, one real and one illusory, one bright and one dark, rotating around each other, faster and faster.
Finally, both Ask Heart Swords disappeared, replaced by a continuously rotating yin-yang symbol.
Sword intent transformed into yin and yang.
The subsequent beams of starlight, as they descended, seemed to be drawn by some force, falling into the yin-yang diagram.

‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’

Muffled sounds continuously rang out. The yin-yang diagram shook ceaselessly but didn't collapse.
At the same time, Qin Sang noticed that his sword array was also being subtly affected, and he couldn’t help but feel secretly astonished.
Although he was only at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, with the Cloud Wanderer Sword and the sword array, relying solely on swordsmanship, even late-Nascent Soul cultivators had to treat him with caution.
Even a powerful being like the Spirit Nether King, while not fearing the Seven Mansions Dividing Sword Array, wouldn't be able to break it easily.
Unexpectedly, before True Person Zhijian, only a few breaths had passed, and they seemed to have found a way to counter it.
One must know that True Person Zhijian's cultivation was the same as his, also at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.
“Is the gap between myself and True Person Zhijian in the Sword Dao truly this wide?”
Qin Sang suddenly felt like he was showing off his meager skills before an expert, but he wasn't discouraged. After all, he hadn't unleashed the full power of his sword array yet.

‘Rumble…’

Ripples spread through the water.
Looking from outside the sword array, the entire area of water was enveloped by an obscure energy, seemingly isolated from the world.
But it wasn't peaceful within. Tremors continuously emanated from inside, shaking heaven and earth.
This confrontation lasted for a full incense stick's worth of time, and the scene within the sword array remained the same.
The yin-yang diagram rode atop the starlight, rotating on its own.
Qin Sang had used almost all the variations of his sword array, unable to break it open, let alone injure True Person Zhijian.

‘Hum!’

Suddenly, the seven mansion stars resonated together, and an unprecedentedly rich starlight illuminated the starry sea.
A ferocious beast was born within the starry sea, formed from stellar煞 energy. It let out a thunderous roar and lunged downwards!
“A Western Sacred Beast…”
True Person Zhijian's face showed a grave expression for the first time, murmuring in a voice Qin Sang could hear, “This array imitates the celestial stars, profound and extraordinary. It’s a pity it only contains the Western Seven Mansions. If it could incorporate all the stars in the heavens, with the Four Symbols complete, the Three Enclosures present, and the Nine Luminaries shining together, it would be a peerless sword array!”
Hearing these words, Qin Sang was slightly startled. True Person Zhijian’s words seemed to have a deeper meaning. There was no time to ponder it now. He focused all his energy on controlling the White Tiger Sacred Beast, crashing it towards the yin-yang diagram!
