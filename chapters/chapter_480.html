<h1>Chapter 473: Immortal's Abode</h1><p>Suddenly, all the runes began to rapidly revolve around the stone platform, eventually forming a door.</p><p>A downward-facing door opened on the platform.</p><p>All the runes shattered, swirling rapidly within the doorway.  Rippling light emanated from within, and beyond the fragmented brilliance lay chaos, impossible to see through, its destination unknown.</p><p>The moment Elder Starpalm unleashed the stream of light, Yu Shanting suddenly activated his bronze bell, pushing Qingluan aside and, without looking back, leaped towards the door.</p><p>Qingluan had been preventing Yu Shanting from approaching Granny Jing.  With Yu Shanting's sudden change of direction, Qingluan couldn't react in time and was evaded.</p><p>Around Elder Starpalm,</p><p>the spatial fluctuations grew increasingly violent and terrifying. Elder Starpalm seemed unable to withstand the pressure of the shattering space, not only sweating profusely but also trembling as if with a seizure.</p><p>The space around him grew increasingly menacing, brewing incredibly terrifying and violent power.</p><p>"Fall!"</p><p>Elder Starpalm roared,</p><p>even vocalizing with great difficulty.</p><p>His voice was incredibly hoarse, almost inaudible.</p><p>The stars shifted, and the Milky Way easily shattered the bright moon, then descended from the sky, returning to Elder Starpalm.</p><p>All the stars connected, forming the silver robe seen earlier.</p><p>With his treasure returned, Elder Starpalm's expression eased somewhat. Ignoring Granny Jing, he mirrored Yu Shanting's actions, exerting all his strength to lunge towards the door.</p><p>Although his cultivation had soared, he wasn't much faster than Yu Shanting due to the immense pressure from the shattering space.</p><p>The silver robe, which had borne most of the pressure for him, now showed signs of splitting apart, with the outermost stars vanishing at an alarming rate.</p><p>Even if Elder Starpalm escaped this calamity, his treasure would be severely damaged, likely requiring decades of nurturing to recover.</p><p>Within a moment, the space would engulf the silver robe, and Elder Starpalm would surely perish. He dared not make any unnecessary movements.</p><p>He had only one thought: escape!</p><p>……</p><p>That door is the entrance they came through!</p><p>Qin Sang realized. Behind that door lay the path back to where they entered.</p><p>Elder Starpalm shattered the chains and unleashed his cultivation to break the entrance seal.</p><p>They wanted to escape!</p><p>Witnessing this, Qin Sang's expression changed.</p><p>He had already withdrawn the Ebony Sword. The space around Elder Starpalm was too terrifying; the Ebony Sword would only be devoured if it entered.</p><p>He wanted to switch targets and pursue Yu Shanting with his sword, but it was too late.  They had clearly planned this for a long time, choosing their moment perfectly.</p><p>Even more frightening, the spatial shattering caused by Elder Starpalm was rapidly spreading outwards. Darkness pervaded the void, concealing a beast within, devouring everything.</p><p>The entire plaza was about to be engulfed.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly felt a flash of brightness before his eyes. The moonlight shifted slightly, enveloping him.</p><p>Granny Jing!</p><p>Qin Sang looked up sharply and saw Granny Jing standing in the air, ethereal and immortal-like, looking down at Elder Starpalm.</p><p>The space around her was also tainted by darkness, about to be consumed.  Facing this situation, her expression remained calm, her eyes unwavering.</p><p>"Seeking your own death."</p><p>Granny Jing said coldly.</p><p>Above her head floated the Landscape and Hidden Moon Painting. The moon had somehow returned to the painting.</p><p>The scroll unfurled, revealing what seemed to be a real world within.</p><p>A boundless landscape.</p><p>Wind and clouds surged.</p><p>A bright moon rose from the sea of clouds!</p><p>The moon absorbed the essence of the entire painting, overshadowing everything else. Then, a beam of moonlight, incredibly gentle yet exceptionally swift, shot out from the painting.</p><p>This moonlight, as if teleporting, struck Elder Starpalm the instant it left the painting.</p><p>The door was within reach, a single leap away.</p><p>This short distance, however, became an insurmountable chasm.</p><p>Elder Starpalm was immobilized by the moonlight.</p><p>The next moment, Qingluan, trailing a streak of azure light, flew towards him with beautiful grace, ignoring the shattered space around Elder Starpalm and fearlessly rushing in, embracing him.</p><p>Qingluan looked up and cried out to Granny Jing, its call filled with sorrow, its eyes revealing endless grief, as if a tear fell.</p><p>It erupted with power far surpassing that of a Spirit Manifestation Realm spirit beast, knocking Elder Starpalm away.</p><p>"No..."</p><p>Elder Starpalm let out a final cry, filled with utter despair.</p><p>Qin Sang, momentarily stunned by Qingluan, suddenly felt a tightness around him as Granny Jing wrapped him in the Landscape and Hidden Moon Painting and rushed into the door.</p><p>At the last moment, Qin Sang retrieved his two flying swords and didn't forget to grab the handsome young man abandoned by Elder Starpalm and Yu Shanting.</p><p>After their figures disappeared, the entire plaza was swallowed by darkness.</p><p>The terrifying storm engulfed both Qingluan and Elder Starpalm, intensifying.</p><p>What lay beyond the door?</p><p>Would there be the Yuan Mirage Sect army, or even Leng Yuntian waiting on the other side?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know, but he had no choice but to obey Granny Jing's command. Elder Starpalm was certainly destined to be devoured by the spatial storm, but Yu Shanting had escaped through the door and couldn't be allowed to return to the Yuan Mirage Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang fully supported Granny Jing's pursuit of Yu Shanting to the death. As for the final outcome, it was up to fate.</p><p>Chaotic forces swirled within the door, disorienting Qin Sang. Fortunately, the Landscape and Hidden Moon Painting continued to protect him, preventing him from being separated from Granny Jing.</p><p>"Suppress your cultivation to the Qi Refining Realm..."</p><p>Qin Sang heard Granny Jing's voice. This was a strange command, but Qin Sang didn't question it, complying without hesitation and activating the Spirit Concealment Art.</p><p>Just as he suppressed his cultivation, Qin Sang felt a coolness on his chest as Granny Jing extended a finger and placed a restriction on him.</p><p>The restriction wasn't complex, serving only to mask his cultivation level.</p><p>The next moment, the chaos abruptly vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang's feet landed on solid ground.  He quickly opened his eyes and found himself in a vast hall, about the same size as the plaza.  Towering stone pillars surrounded them, but they weren't constructed from rough stones.</p><p>A stone platform rose from the smooth floor, directly beneath their feet.</p><p>The platform resembled the one in the plaza.</p><p>The hall was empty. Qin Sang's gaze swept across the area, spotting a single figure fleeing towards the hall's exit.</p><p>"Yu Shanting!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed softly.</p><p>The Landscape and Hidden Moon Painting shot out another beam of moonlight, striking Yu Shanting's back. A scream echoed as a bloody hole appeared on his back, sending him tumbling to the ground. However, he quickly got back up.</p><p>Watching Yu Shanting rush out of the hall, Qin Sang felt a surge of anxiety. "Senior, kill him quickly!"</p><p>Simultaneously, he prepared to summon the Ebony Sword to aid Granny Jing in the pursuit.</p><p>This seemed to be another secret realm similar to Skypointing Peak, which Qin Sang remembered Elder Starpalm referring to as the Immortal's Abode.</p><p>The absence of the Yuan Mirage Sect army was a good thing. Yu Shanting had to die.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Granny Jing didn't pursue Yu Shanting. Instead, she withdrew the Landscape and Hidden Moon Painting, looked at Qin Sang, and said, "No rush."</p>
