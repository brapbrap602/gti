<h1>Chapter 1020: Su Nu</h1><p>Chapter 1020: Su Nu</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>Su Nu was startled awake.  She abruptly turned her head, her face alert, and shouted, "Who's there!"</p><p>"Junior Sister, don't worry, it's me."</p><p>A figure appeared, revealing the handsome young man.</p><p>"Senior Brother…"</p><p>Su Nu's expression relaxed, the alertness leaving her eyes. She seemed to trust the young man implicitly.</p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief, a radiant smile spreading across her face.  She said sweetly, "Senior Brother arrived first! Where are the others?"</p><p>The young man was momentarily stunned by Su Nu's bright smile.</p><p>However, he didn't notice the complex glint that briefly flickered in her eyes as she spoke.</p><p>"They should be arriving soon. I didn't expect the first trial to be a puppet battle. Otherwise, we could have met up in the previous stage…"</p><p>The handsome young man approached, noticing the blood on the ice and Su Nu's condition. His expression turned grave. He exclaimed, "Junior Sister, are you injured?"</p><p>Su Nu nodded, her voice weak and tinged with resentment. "I was slightly injured in the first stage and suppressed it.  The ice lizard attack aggravated my hidden injuries, forcing me to stop and heal."</p><p>"With your cultivation, the puppet battle shouldn't be difficult! I see… Master and the others have protected you too well! The final puppet beast in the puppet battle is indeed difficult to handle. You've focused too much on cultivation; while your progress is incredibly fast and unparalleled, you lack experience, haven't had enough real combat, and don't know how to react when facing a strong enemy. You get flustered…"</p><p>The handsome young man slapped his hand against his palm, believing he'd found the problem. He advised, "After we leave the Seven Killing Hall, Junior Sister, ask Master to let you go on a training expedition. I'll accompany you and ensure your safety."</p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother."</p><p>Su Nu bowed gracefully, gathering her meditation cushion.  She said, "With Senior Brother here, I'm relieved.  To prevent the Soul Cleansing Liquid from being stolen, let's go. The other senior brothers will probably join us later."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>The young man, unsuspecting, flashed to Su Nu's side.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as he approached, the smile vanished from Su Nu's face. She looked coldly at the young man and unleashed a powerful palm strike.</p><p>A black palm imprint, composed of demonic energy, shot towards the young man's vital point.</p><p>"Junior Sister, you…"</p><p>The young man was shocked.</p><p>He never imagined that this innocent girl, whom he perceived as naive and unworldly, would suddenly attack him, especially him.</p><p>They were too close.  Caught off guard, the young man could only dodge sideways.</p><p>The moment he moved, he sensed something amiss.  He knew something was wrong.</p><p>In the ice, numerous jade bracelets suddenly materialized.</p><p>Their arrangement revealed a spirit formation, and the young man's foot had stepped right into its range.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The ice layer exploded, countless ice shards flying everywhere.</p><p>'Jingle… jingle…'</p><p>The jade bracelets vibrated, like bells, emitting a clear, ringing sound.</p><p>But to the young man, it was like a death knell. He hastily summoned his innate treasure, a silver chain.</p><p>He named it the Binding Immortal Chain.</p><p>However, the moment the chain appeared,</p><p>a gust of wind suddenly attacked.</p><p>The young man only caught a glimpse of a black light flashing past before realizing, to his horror, that a barrier had suddenly appeared between him and his innate treasure, causing a sudden stillness.</p><p>A small black snake, formed from demonic energy, appeared on the silver chain.</p><p>The snake's tail was held in Su Nu's left hand.</p><p>Her other hand quickly formed seals, and her lips parted slightly as she softly said, "Explode!"</p><p>The jade bracelets trembled even more violently, suddenly rushing towards the young man, exploding with a deafening roar before his horrified eyes.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The spirit formation self-destructed, pulverizing everything around it.</p><p>Su Nu retreated, avoiding the shockwave, then cautiously glanced into the distance, confirming no one else was there. She flashed back to the center of the explosion.</p><p>Silence reigned. The young man seemed to have been killed.</p><p>"Stop pretending, I know you're not dead."</p><p>Su Nu said disdainfully, demonic energy surging from her palm, transforming into a demonic blade that slashed down.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The blade was stopped.</p><p>The young man reappeared, disheveled and utterly devastated, a stark contrast to his previous appearance. Only a fragment of his innate treasure remained in his hand, his breath weak.</p><p>He stared fixedly at Su Nu's pretty face, his eyes filled with bitter hatred. "Vicious woman! We have no grievances between us. Why did you set a trap to kill me!"</p><p>"Vicious woman? No grievances?"</p><p>Su Nu sneered, making no reply, and attacked again.</p><p>The severely wounded young man was no match for Su Nu, and she easily captured him.</p><p>She tossed him onto the ice, her expression complex.  "Senior Brother, considering our decades of close companionship, if you honestly answer one question, I'll grant you a quick death, sparing you the soul-searching."</p><p>He remained silent, his eyes filled with hatred.</p><p>Su Nu ignored him, continuing, "You were sent by the Alliance Leader and your master, Old Man Xun, to monitor me, weren't you? What is their purpose in taking me in?"</p><p>The young man's expression changed, shock flashing in his eyes.</p><p>"I knew it!" Su Nu sighed softly. "Are you wondering how I discovered this?  Mistress Yue orchestrated everything, pretending my discovery by the Alliance Leader was accidental. She claimed my exceptional talent led to my apprenticeship, but she actually intended to offer me as a gift. She thought my memory was lost, but I remember everything!"</p><p>Su Nu's face contorted with bitter resentment. "She used dozens of us sisters as sacrifices, employing dark magic to create what she called 'Five Yin bodies.'  Only I survived!  Mistress Yue succeeded; she offered me up, and now she's achieved her goal, hasn't she? For decades, I pretended to be naive and allowed you to manipulate me, but my fear grew! Even with my Five Yin body, my cultivation speed is too fast. What are you planning to do to me that you'd go to such lengths to cultivate me?  Your supposed reunion was actually surveillance, wasn't it?  And there are surely Alliance guards at the Inner Chamber entrance, correct?"</p><p>Su Nu's gaze locked onto the young man's eyes, her voice sharp with accusation.</p><p>"Junior Sister, you're overthinking things. The Alliance Leader valued you for your exceptional talent. For decades, Master and the Alliance Leader guided your cultivation; they never mistreated you."</p><p>The young man sighed and closed his eyes.</p><p>Seeing his stubbornness, Su Nu hesitated no longer, pressing her hand to his forehead.</p><p>Moments later, the young man was dead.</p><p>"It was that old ghost's orders, to get close to me.  Unfortunately, he knew too little.  Did you really think I was simply letting you manipulate me?"</p><p>Su Nu snorted, looking down at the corpse. After a moment's hesitation, she summoned flames, reducing it to ashes.</p><p>She took out a token, intending to destroy it.  But the token was incredibly hard and linked to her blood, impossible to discard.</p>
