<h1>Chapter 759: The Ancient Divine Platform</h1><p>Xiang Yi and the others stopped.</p><p>The group arrived in front of the second stone hall.</p><p>It was very similar to the first stone hall, except the ancient restrictions were different.</p><p>The Earth Positioning Banner could still break the restrictions.</p><p>They cleared out the surrounding beasts, rested briefly, set up the Earth Positioning Banner, and began to try and break the restrictions.</p><p>The earthquake caused by the Earth Positioning Banner was unavoidable, but this time everyone was clearly more alert. While activating the spirit array, they kept a close eye on their surroundings.</p><p>No one wanted to repeat the same mistake and be surrounded and killed by beasts again.</p><p>Even if a second cultivator with the surname Pan appeared, they couldn't possibly achieve such a good result.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the distance, motionless, doing nothing.</p><p>The Earth Positioning Banner broke through the ancient restrictions, Xiang Yi flew into the stone hall, and quickly came out, whispering, "It's done! There's only one stone hall left, fellow Daoists, follow me."</p><p>Xiang Yi changed direction; the third stone hall was closer to the rift.</p><p>The Bone Lotus was being eroded faster and faster, so they quickened their pace.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the locations of these three stone halls formed a very regular triangle, involving ancient secrets, discovered by the East Pole Alliance.</p><p>The third stone hall also opened very smoothly.</p><p>When Xiang Yi came out of the third stone hall, the ground suddenly began to shake.</p><p>At this time, the Earth Positioning Banner had been withdrawn.</p><p>The source of this tremor was in the distance and deep underground. The waves were thicker and heavier, as if the earth had a powerful heartbeat, reviving after the three stone halls were opened.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and looked towards the center of the three stone halls; the tremor came from there.</p><p>Xiang Yi seemed to have opened some mechanism; something was emerging there.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang sensed Xiang Yi and the others suddenly turning back and rushing towards him at high speed, heading straight for the source of the tremor. He quickly dodged.</p><p>"The Ancient Divine Platform has emerged, which may alarm the surrounding beasts. I ask all fellow Daoists to work together to protect me..."</p><p>Xiang Yi's voice came.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately followed.</p><p>Before reaching the source of the tremor, Qin Sang saw a golden light in the distance.</p><p>The golden light was extremely dazzling, penetrating the purple mist and clearly visible even from such a distance.  Continuing forward, getting closer, Qin Sang could even vaguely see the outline of the Ancient Divine Platform.</p><p>The Ancient Divine Platform was seven or eight Zhang high, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, shaped like a tower. Around the platform, there were a few slender golden lights, barely visible.</p><p>They had passed by nearby before, but hadn't noticed it.</p><p>The Ancient Divine Platform was so conspicuous; it was impossible not to see it. It must have just appeared, displaying its unusual phenomenon.</p><p>Qin Sang stared for a moment, realizing these golden lights were likely chains, extending from the top of the tower to the ground, one at each of the four corners of the Ancient Divine Platform.</p><p>This scene looked familiar.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recalled the black tower they had entered with Duke Dongyang and Chen Yan in the Purple Subtlety Palace. It also had iron chains at its four corners, very similar to this one.</p><p>But this Ancient Divine Platform was far less grand than the black tower on Tianshan Mountain.</p><p>"Is it a coincidence?"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>Because he could only see the outline and not the details of the Ancient Divine Platform, he couldn't make a judgment.</p><p>Xiang Yi and the others had already arrived in front of the Ancient Divine Platform. Qin Sang stopped in the distance, observing the situation.</p><p>A large hole appeared in the ground.</p><p>'Crack... Crack...'</p><p>'Clatter...'</p><p>The Ancient Stone Platform slowly rose from within, golden light soaring into the sky, extremely dazzling.</p><p>Everyone squinted, examining this Ancient Divine Platform.</p><p>The golden light wasn't emitted by the Ancient Divine Platform itself, but by the ancient restrictions around it. The Ancient Divine Platform looked very ordinary. At first glance, it looked like a crudely carved stone platform.</p><p>There were layers of steps on the stone platform, all the way to the top, square and square, with the top about one Zhang square.</p><p>There was nothing on it, and there was no door-like structure on the entire platform.</p><p>At the four corners of the Ancient Divine Platform, an iron chain hung down, deeply embedded in the ground. As the Ancient Divine Platform rose, the chains gradually tightened. The 'clattering' sound was made by the swaying chains.</p><p>The chains were covered with runes, incredibly profound.</p><p>Strangely, these clearly extraordinary iron chains were actually rusty, seemingly unable to withstand the erosion of endless years.</p><p>However, the runes on the chains still shone, their divine power undiminished.</p><p>A muffled sound.</p><p>The Ancient Divine Platform rose completely out of the ground.</p><p>Everyone looked up, then all looked at Xiang Yi.</p><p>Xiang Yi walked around the Ancient Divine Platform and took out six talismans, one for each person.</p><p>The six talismans weren't exactly the same. Four of them were engraved with black dragons, their eyes vivid and lifelike. The other two were made of black jade cones, with a strange shape.</p><p>The four Black Dragon Talismans were given to the Liu couple, the young man with the sword, and Cui Ji, while Xiang Yi and the richly dressed fat man held the Jade Cone Talismans.</p><p>He had the Liu couple and the others stand at the four corners of the Ancient Divine Platform, facing the iron chains, then he stood shoulder to shoulder with the richly dressed fat man, facing the restrictions on the Ancient Divine Platform itself.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Liu, after Fellow Daoist An and I start breaking the ancient restrictions, you will fully activate the Black Dragon Talismans to suppress the iron chains. It seems the fierce beasts in the forbidden area haven't been attracted, so we'll be under much less pressure."</p><p>Xiang Yi made the arrangements and nodded to the richly dressed fat man.</p><p>The two of them brought out the Jade Cone Talismans together.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The Jade Cone Talismans shattered, the talisman paper flying everywhere.</p><p>A mass of black light appeared, wriggling and transforming, finally becoming a real jade cone.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The two shouted, and the Jade Cone Talismans suddenly vanished into thin air, appearing near the Ancient Divine Platform in the next moment.</p><p>'Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Impacted by the jade cones, the ancient restrictions of the Ancient Divine Platform were activated, and the golden light became even more dazzling, dyeing Xiang Yi and the others completely gold.</p><p>The jade cones were also unyielding, tough and sharp, with a continuous stream of black energy erupting from their tips, continuously impacting the platform.</p><p>At this moment, the iron chains at the four corners of the Ancient Divine Platform moved without any wind, making a loud 'clattering' sound.</p><p>The runes on the iron chains flickered, suddenly bursting with a silvery-white light.</p><p>Lightning appeared on the iron chains!</p><p>In an instant, the rust on the iron chains disappeared, replaced by streaks of silver moving on them, as if they had transformed into lightning chains, emitting a terrifying aura.</p><p>Lightning surged, poised to strike, and Xiang Yi's expression changed.</p><p>He clearly sensed that these lightning bolts were aimed at him, a punishment for those who attacked the divine platform. Their power was terrifying. If the lightning were released, he and the richly dressed fat man definitely couldn't withstand it.</p><p>Xiang Yi shouted urgently, "Quickly use the Black Dragon Talismans to suppress the iron chains!"</p><p>The Liu couple and the others didn't dare to delay, immediately bringing out the Black Dragon Talismans.</p><p>The moment the Black Dragon Talismans shattered, earth-shaking dragon roars rang out one after another.</p><p>A mass of black energy suddenly rushed out of the talismans, instantly transforming into real black dragons, soaring through the clouds, claws outstretched, incredibly ferocious.</p><p>The black dragons' eyes were extremely sinister, giving off an exceptionally fierce feeling, as if they were demonic dragons from the abyss, their bodies covered in rolling black smoke, emitting endless demonic energy.</p>
