<h1>Chapter 1486: The Ganoderma Ruyi</h1><p>The eldest disciple clutched the jade slip, hesitating for a moment before asking, "Master, you previously mentioned that the Palace Lord of the Profound Heaven Palace might no longer be able to act. With so many experts gathered on this ship, can we not entangle the Profound Heaven Palace and create an opportunity for ourselves?"</p><p>The Elder of Chaos and Demons seemed to be in a good mood. He leisurely replied, "The Profound Heaven Palace is a behemoth. Even without its Palace Lord, it is not something a ragtag group can shake. That Grand Elder is no pushover either. We cannot be certain of the Palace Lord's condition or how much the Profound Heaven Palace has grasped about the Holy Land. We must remain cautious. If we could persuade that fellow who knows the Thunder Escape technique, there might be some hope. Unfortunately, he is as timid as a mouse. He appeared once in the Valley of a Hundred Flowers and then vanished without a trace. However, even so, we must still rely on the power of the demon race to keep the Profound Heaven Palace occupied outside and weaken their forces in the Holy Land."</p><p>The eldest disciple, having received his master's teachings, voiced his concerns, "The trusted subordinates of the Great Sage Heavenly Peng are all ancient demons, powerful and cunning. If you invite the Great Sage Heavenly Peng, I fear they may harbor ulterior motives."</p><p>The Elder of Chaos and Demons was not worried. "That is precisely why I only allow the Great Sage Heavenly Peng to accompany us. I will only let him borrow a few subordinates from the Nine-Headed Great Sage to create a show of force and pressure the Profound Heaven Palace. The initiative lies in my hands. A single demonic Great Sage cannot stir up much trouble."</p><p>"Master is truly wise!" The eldest disciple's doubts were dispelled, and he bowed respectfully before returning to the cabin.</p><p>The Elder of Chaos and Demons' expression turned serious as he frowned and gazed at the storm belt. Although he was confident, his failed attempt at the Ten Thousand Demons Assembly had left him with lingering suspicions. But now that things had come to this, he could only wait.</p><p>Suddenly, the Elder of Chaos and Demons' expression changed slightly. He lightly tapped his spatial pouch, and a white light flew outâ€”it was the Ganoderma Ruyi. The moment it left the pouch, a faint white halo rippled from the Ganoderma Ruyi.</p><p>Seeing this, the Elder of Chaos and Demons' eyes flashed with intense joy, and his worries vanished. He laughed heartily, "Just as I thought! Just as I thought!"</p><p>The Elder of Chaos and Demons grasped the Ganoderma Ruyi and stomped his foot. The Black Dragon Treasure Ship set sail, heading straight for the storm belt.</p><p>The others on the ship were immediately alerted.</p><p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p><p>Streaks of light flew to the bow of the ship.</p><p>The Feather-Robed Primordial Lord, the Cunning General, the Moon Demon, the Discipline-Keeping True Man...</p><p>Demonic figures rarely seen in ordinary times emerged from the cabins, along with some reclusive Nascent Soul cultivators from the Boundless Sea, some righteous, some wicked. There were even a few wandering cultivators at the Crescent Moon Realm.</p><p>Yet, in the eyes of the Elder of Chaos and Demons, these Nascent Souls were nothing more than a ragtag group.</p><p>At that moment, an overwhelmingly powerful aura surged forward, causing everyone along the way to pale and hastily make way.</p><p>A golden light arrived in an instant, landing unceremoniously at the bow of the ship, standing shoulder to shoulder with the Elder of Chaos and Demons.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>As the Great Sage Heavenly Peng appeared, the Black Dragon Treasure Ship entered the storm belt and was immediately besieged by hurricanes.</p><p>His gaze swept over and landed on the Ganoderma Ruyi in the Elder of Chaos and Demons' hand. "Old Demon, is this the Ruyi that can guide us to the Holy Land of the Profound Heaven Palace?"</p><p>"Exactly!" The Elder of Chaos and Demons was brimming with confidence. "I obtained this treasure by chance and discovered its connection to the Holy Land of the Profound Heaven Palace. The Holy Land is a treasure trove that can sustain a massive sect's prosperity for generations. I have long admired it!"</p><p>As he spoke the last sentence, the Elder of Chaos and Demons deliberately raised his voice.</p><p>Everyone heard it clearly.</p><p>The Nascent Souls were all stirred.</p><p>As the Elder of Chaos and Demons had said, the Holy Land of the Profound Heaven Palace was renowned throughout the three realms of the North Sea, recognized as the number one treasure land. Unfortunately, the Profound Heaven Palace was too powerful, monopolizing the Holy Land, and no one dared to challenge them.</p><p>The Profound Heaven Palace's secrecy measures were also impeccable. Over the years, countless people had tried to locate the Holy Land and sneak in, but all had failed.</p><p>Rumors, both true and false, filled the streets, perhaps deliberately spread by the Profound Heaven Palace to confuse the public.</p><p>This time, none of the Nascent Souls had come alone; they had all brought their most talented disciples.</p><p>This was because most of the opportunities within the Holy Land were tailored for low-level cultivators.</p><p>This was the true secret behind the Profound Heaven Palace's endless stream of geniuses.</p><p>Legends said that from the Foundation Establishment stage onwards, similar opportunities covered every minor stage, even extending to the Nascent Soul stage, forming a complete system that left people in awe.</p><p>Many had long suspected that this was the remnant of an ancient immortal sect, a place for nurturing disciples.</p><p>While it was difficult to uncover information related to the Nascent Soul stage, there were plenty of rumors about stages below it. From this, it could be inferred that Nascent Soul cultivators could also reap significant benefits.</p><p>The jade slip the Elder of Chaos and Demons had just handed them contained extremely detailed information, far more comprehensive than anything anyone else had gathered. It was unclear how long the old demon had been collecting this.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Peng noticed a loophole and retorted, "I have long heard of the Holy Land of the Profound Heaven Palace. But even if this Ganoderma Ruyi fell into my hands, I wouldn't know where to wait for them. By the time we followed the Ruyi's guidance, the Profound Heaven Palace would have already closed the Holy Land and left. Before this, how did you know the Holy Land was nearby? Did you bribe someone, or have you been planning this for three hundred years or even longer?"</p><p>The Elder of Chaos and Demons smiled without answering.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Peng snorted but did not press further.</p><p>The Black Dragon Treasure Ship, though massive, was incredibly agile and fast.</p><p>Not long after entering the storm belt, the Elder of Chaos and Demons suddenly changed course, heading straight west.</p><p>Soon, everyone on the ship felt something and looked up simultaneously.</p><p>Above them, a massive rift hung in the void, continuously devouring the surrounding hurricanes as it slowly widened.</p><p>It was like an ancient behemoth opening its maw, gazing down at these ants.</p><p>The astonishing sight left everyone shaken and dumbfounded.</p><p>At the same time, the Elder of Chaos and Demons and the Great Sage Heavenly Peng both sensed something. Following the direction of the rift, they looked deep into the hurricanes ahead.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The Elder of Chaos and Demons suddenly halted the Black Dragon Treasure Ship.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Peng frowned slightly and pointed ahead. "The fluctuations there are strange. The entrance to the Holy Land should be ahead. Why stop here?"</p><p>The Elder of Chaos and Demons raised his head and said calmly, "If we charge in from the entrance, the Profound Heaven Palace will be prepared and will surely use the terrain to block us. Even if we force our way in, we will waste a lot of time. If the Profound Heaven Palace decides to fight to the death, the outcome is unpredictable. Look at these dark clouds..."</p><p>As he spoke, the Elder of Chaos and Demons pointed to a certain part of the rift.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Peng followed his gaze.</p><p>Amid the thick dark clouds, there were a few areas that appeared thinner, clearly weaker than the rest. It was likely that one could enter the Holy Land from there, though the resistance would still be significant.</p><p>The Elder of Chaos and Demons glanced back. "If we work together, it shouldn't be too difficult. Once we enter the Holy Land, it will be too late for the Profound Heaven Palace to stop us."</p><p>After proposing this, it was unanimously agreed upon.</p><p>The Elder of Chaos and Demons put away the Black Dragon Treasure Ship, and the Nascent Souls protected their respective disciples, forming a battle formation.</p>
