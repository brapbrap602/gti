<h1>Chapter 601: The Reason</h1><p>Yun Youzi saw Qin Sang's worry and confusion. He leaped forward, approaching the Nan Ming Li Huo, looked around, and suddenly flicked his fingers, sending countless strands of spiritual energy into the walls of the hidden passage.</p><p>The next moment, a faint blue light suddenly illuminated the passage.</p><p>Countless unusually complex runes inexplicably appeared on the walls of the passage. As Yun Youzi moved, the runes were activated, the blue light grew brighter, and a spiritual array outline emerged from it.</p><p>The blue light was nowhere near as bright as the Nan Ming Li Huo, but it still held its own.</p><p>Qin Sang found that this spiritual array had nothing in common with the several ruined arrays and celestial prohibitions he had encountered before. It didn't seem to be inherently part of the Zi Wei Palace.</p><p>However, although it wasn't as complex and mysterious as the outer celestial arrays, it was still extremely exquisite, a complete system in itself, far beyond the capabilities of ordinary people to create.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand it; even glancing at it for a moment made him feel dizzy.</p><p>The blue light shone brightly.</p><p>The next moment, a small, fiery red bird flew out from within, chirping and circling around Yun Youzi before settling obediently on his arm, preening its feathers.</p><p>The bird looked vividly alive.</p><p>However, a sweep of spiritual sense revealed the truth: the bird wasn't a living creature, but a puppet intricately woven from some kind of spiritual wood, extraordinarily exquisite and breathtakingly lifelike!</p><p>The bird was entirely fiery red, its feathers seeming to burn with flames, but this wasn't due to the original materials. Its aura was identical to the Nan Ming Li Huo.</p><p>Its skeleton and feathers were made from red strips and some kind of slender leaf, trimmed and then transformed by absorbing the Nan Ming Li Huo with the help of the spiritual array, making it impossible to identify the original materials.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang had met many cultivators who mastered puppetry, but this puppet was so skillfully made, almost indistinguishable from a real bird, that aside from the Qingluan created by Jing Po Po, only this bird could compare.</p><p>Who placed the bird here, or was it always there?</p><p>Qin Sang marveled silently.</p><p>Yun Youzi held the bird in his palm and said with relief, “Someone buried this here long ago, to allow it to absorb the power of the Nan Ming Li Huo. After years of nurturing, it has finally assimilated some of the Nan Ming Li Huo's essence.  With the help of this spiritual array and the puppet, it can create a passage through the flames. Getting past the Nan Ming Li Huo isn't difficult; the hard part is obtaining the cauldron shard.  Among the people I could ask, only you, Qin Lao Di, are capable of doing it.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze from the bird puppet and looked curiously at Yun Youzi. What obstacle was there ahead, and why was Yun Youzi so certain that he could help him obtain the cauldron shard?</p><p>Yun Youzi extended a finger, soothing the bird puppet, and pointed ahead.</p><p>“Not far ahead, the passage is severed by a sword mark.  Originally, one could enter and exit from there, but the sword energy in the mark persists, and no one dares to venture through it.”</p><p>“The swordsman likely cultivated an ice-cold technique.  The lingering sword energy is a type of profound ice sword energy.”</p><p>“The sword energy gathers but doesn't dissipate; it draws on the local spiritual energy, forming an extremely cold, deadly wind that rages perpetually around the sword mark. The outer illusionary array conceals it, so it's not visible.”</p><p>“What’s even more terrifying is that this deadly wind carries the lingering profound ice sword intent from the sword mark. This intent has evolved into an extreme and strange chill. This combination… doesn't Qin Lao Di find it familiar?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>Upon hearing Yun Youzi describe these characteristics, Qin Sang immediately recalled the Xuan Frost Deadly Wind he encountered in Wu Ya Valley.</p><p>The Xuan Frost Deadly Wind formed naturally, while this deadly wind was created by the sword energy; their origins differed, yet they sounded remarkably similar.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Yun Youzi seemed to be implying something, and his expression shifted slightly. How could he know that he had encountered the Xuan Frost Deadly Wind?</p><p>“Senior, that day… did you still have the energy to perceive what was happening outside?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked astonished.</p><p>When he was picking night-blooming lilies in Wu Ya Valley, Yun Youzi had used the green lamp and the flawless pearl to resist the Xuan Frost Deadly Wind, almost to the point of collapse. Qin Sang had been about to help him.</p><p>And yet he still had the energy to perceive him!</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded slightly, then shook his head, saying, “At that time, I was indeed at my wit’s end, but my spiritual senses are sharp. I vaguely sensed the presence of another person nearby.  For someone to appear in that place, not attack me, and not take the night-blooming lilies...  I could only think of you, Lao Di.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Yun Youzi's words greatly surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>No wonder outside the Zi Wei Palace, Yun Youzi had first asked for his opinion on whether the man in black was the Wu Ji Sect Master.</p><p>He knew he had reached the end of the ice cave, witnessed the great battle, and might have seen their true forms!</p><p>Although Yunyouzi didn't witness the battle firsthand, he could guess.  The Wuyagou Valley is remote; it's unusual to have so many Yuan Ying cultivators appearing there at once.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p>Since Yunyouzi already knew of Yi Tiannie's existence, Qin Sang briefly recounted his encounter with Yu Hua in the ice cave.</p><p>“Senior, I had no intention of entering; I was forced there by a powerful enemy, with nowhere else to go.  In the ice cave, I initially intended to help you, but then you single-handedly…”</p><p>Yunyouzi waved his hand, saying sincerely, “I'm not ungrateful, I understand your intentions. That was a trial, like a fledgling breaking its shell. Even I wouldn't have rashly intervened. Besides, my obtaining the Night Orchid Lily was entirely thanks to you. Do you remember the final tremor in the ice cave? You were in front of me then, shielding me from a blast of Xuanfrost Gale, allowing me to escape…”</p><p>Yunyouzi bowed to Qin Sang. “Junior Brother, you must have some secret technique to withstand the Xuanfrost Gale's chill, right? Your cultivation is far stronger now, so the technique's power should be even greater.  Retrieving the cauldron fragments from the Sword Qi Gale falls to you then.”</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>His greatest fear was the Jade Buddha being exposed.</p><p>The Jade Buddha was his most important secret, the foundation of his existence in the cultivation world.  Even those closest to him couldn't know.</p><p>Fortunately, Yunyouzi was misled by the Xuanfrost Gale, misinterpreting his ability to withstand the cold as a secret technique or treasure.  Given Yunyouzi's vast knowledge, he likely wouldn't imagine the existence of such a miraculous object as the Jade Buddha.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang agreed. “If the Sword Qi Gale isn't much stronger than the Xuanfrost Gale, I should be able to withstand it. Senior, feel free to separate the flames and try.”</p><p>Qin Sang's agreement was carefully considered.</p><p>With the Jade Buddha's power, even if the bird spirit puppet malfunctioned and the Nanming Li Fire blocked his path, he could still force his way through the Sword Qi Gale and escape from the other side; he wouldn't be trapped.</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Yunyouzi; this was also a test.</p><p>He trusted Yunyouzi's character, but treasures tempt the heart.</p><p>May old friendships remain unchanged!</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's agreement, Yunyouzi's expression turned serious. “I can fully control the spirit array and puppet for ten breaths. Within ten breaths, regardless of success or failure, you must return!”</p>
