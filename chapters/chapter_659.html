<h1>Chapter 651: Pursued by Enemies, Urgent Escape!</h1><p>Ya Gu seemed to be drifting down the Qingyi River.</p><p>Qin Sang passed by Qianhu Village and found everything normal there. The villagers were going about their daily lives peacefully; women were cooking, children were playing, a scene of tranquility.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>About to fly over Qianhu Village, Qin Sang suddenly descended with a flash of sword light, landing behind the village, in front of the thatched hut where Ya Gu used to live.</p><p>Less than a year had passed since Ya Gu's departure, and no one had occupied the hut; it hadn't changed much.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at a large hole in the hut's roof. He remembered that although the hut was dilapidated and leaked during heavy rain, Ya Gu was diligent and often repaired it with thatch, she wouldn't let the roof become so damaged.</p><p>This seemed to have been caused by a stone, and the marks were fresh.</p><p>Qin Sang used his spiritual sense to scan the area and indeed found a blue stone in the hut. The stone still had green moss on it, clearly recently taken from the Qingyi River.</p><p>Upon seeing the stone, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.</p><p>The stone was inscribed with eight characters:  Enemies pursuing, flee immediately!</p><p>The writing was very scribbled, but clearly Ya Gu's handwriting.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the stone, scanned the surroundings with his spiritual sense, found no other abnormalities, and immediately flew away, continuing to pursue her down the Qingyi River without delay.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang glanced back at Qianhu Village. Judging from the position of the stone and the hole in the hut, Ya Gu had thrown it up from the river.</p><p>Qin Sang could imagine the scene: Ya Gu crushed the Qingfu coins but received no response. Severely injured, she drifted down the Qingyi River, unable to even pull herself ashore. She could only throw the stone up, leaving a message for him.</p><p>Or perhaps, fearing pursuit and exposure, she didn't dare leave the river.</p><p>If he couldn't find Ya Gu, he would definitely come to Qianhu Village to check.  As for whether the pursuers would find the stone first, Ya Gu probably didn't have the energy to consider that; it was the only thing she could do.</p><p>Who had driven Ya Gu to leave a message in this way?</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the stone.</p><p>Enemies?</p><p>What enemies?</p><p>Had this danger been caused by him, endangering Ya Gu?</p><p>Qin Sang was utterly perplexed.</p><p>Carefully recalling his recent experiences since waking up, he had only killed twice: once to avenge Ya Gu, eliminating the Yi Hui Village shaman, and once to eliminate a bandit who attacked the Wu Chong Sect. Both were minor figures.</p><p>It was certain that these bandits had no significant background, lone wolves operating independently.  Even if they had relatives, they wouldn't dare oppose a Foundation Establishment cultivator, let alone threaten Ya Gu, who was under the Wu Chong Sect's protection.</p><p>Within the Wu Chong Sect, only Cui Xuanzi and the Tong-surname cultivator knew about his relationship with Ya Gu.</p><p>Whether it was the Wu Chong Sect, Jing Lei Village, or Baihua Palace, he had used both coercion and inducement, but had not forced them too hard. They lacked the courage and reason to defy him.</p><p>Qin Sang was baffled and could only understand the situation by finding Ya Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the Qingyi River downstream at an incredible speed. As the distance closed, the Qingfu coins' response became clearer, confirming Ya Gu was indeed drifting in the river!</p><p>This caused Qin Sang's heart to sink, but he could only suppress his anxiety.</p><p>Shortly after, the Qingfu coins indicated that Ya Gu was just below, at the bottom of the river.</p><p>The river was vast and incredibly swift. Qin Sang directly plunged his sword into the river's heart and finally found Ya Gu at the bottom.</p><p>Ya Gu's eyes were closed, lifeless, drifting with the current, her body entangled in thick aquatic plants, looking like a corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his true essence, gently enveloped Ya Gu, and carried her up.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Water sprayed everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang carried Ya Gu out of the water, onto the bank, and immediately began to remove the aquatic plants and water from her body.</p><p>Ya Gu's face was pale, the aftermath of a great battle.</p><p>She had numerous wounds, all waterlogged and pale.  The most serious was a shocking blood hole on her left shoulder, seemingly pierced by some sharp weapon.</p><p>The immense force had shattered the bone in Ya Gu's left shoulder, nearly injuring her heart.</p><p>But Ya Gu's condition was extremely critical; her heart had stopped beating.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was cold and stern, but he didn't give up hope. He probed Ya Gu's body with his spiritual sense, then a hint of joy appeared on his face.</p><p>Ya Gu still had a faint breath!</p><p>Though not dead, her injuries were too severe; ordinary pills were useless.  Qin Sang immediately took out the San Guang Jade Liquid from his Qian Jun Ring, poured out a drop, and fed it to Ya Gu.</p><p>As the San Guang Jade Liquid entered her body, a powerful life force erupted within her.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed his hand to the mute girl's abdomen, channeling his energy to help the medicine take effect and guide the life force of the Three Lights Elixir to repair her injuries.</p><p>The mute girl's wounds visibly healed; her broken left shoulder rapidly mended, and color returned to her face and skin.  Even more encouraging, her heart began to beat weakly.</p><p>However, she remained unconscious.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, examining her spirit.  He found it incredibly weak, nearing dissipation. The Three Lights Elixir's life force could heal her body, but not her spirit.</p><p>If he waited, within fifteen minutes, her spirit would dissipate, and she would die nonetheless!</p><p>He had few spirit-restoring pills, none with the efficacy of the Three Lights Elixir.  He produced his best Spirit Nourishing Pill and gave it to her.</p><p>As the pill took effect, her spirit showed signs of improvement, but recovery would be slow.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his flying yaksha to stand guard, then sat on a riverbank stone, holding the mute girl, waiting for her to wake. His face was grave; he alternately gazed at the Qingyi River and the sky, his expression deep and unreadable.</p><p>It was then he noticed four sets of divine script tattoos on her hands and arms.</p><p>The script was complex and varied, capable of producing diverse and extraordinary powers.  Qin Sang's knowledge of divine script was limited, but he vaguely recalled that this type seemed water-related.</p><p>Unexpectedly, she hadn't focused solely on the *Du Tian Mo Yin* but also cultivated divine script.</p><p>Her cultivation was only at the third level of Qi Refinement, a recent breakthrough—lower than Qin Sang had estimated, likely due to the distraction of the divine script.</p><p>Low cultivation didn't mean she was weak.  He found the two sets of script on her hands particularly potent.</p><p>Her achievement in divine script, given the short time she’d cultivated it, was remarkable, showcasing exceptional talent that surprised even Qin Sang.</p><p>Just then, he felt her stir. Looking down, he saw her eyelashes flutter, her eyes opening a crack, revealing a weak, confused gaze.</p><p>“Brother Qin?”</p><p>Seeing his face, she was stunned, thinking she was dreaming.  She murmured, “Thank you, Witch God, for letting me dream of Brother Qin one last time…”</p>
