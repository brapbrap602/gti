<h1>**Chapter 1350: Each Their Own Fortunes **</h1><p>Inner Palace.</p><p>Lu Boyuan and Hanxi were desperately fleeing for their lives in the Inner Palace.</p><p>The journey was fraught with peril.</p><p>Among these dangers, the Five-Colored Immortal Gale  was only a minor threat.</p><p>They were forced to use their combined attack secret art.</p><p>Even so, both the man and the lizard were covered in wounds. Lu Boyuan's Daoist robe was almost dyed crimson with blood, but fortunately, most of the injuries were superficial.</p><p>They occasionally looked up at the sky.</p><p>The distance between the Ziwei Palace  and the large hole in the sky was getting closer. The spatial storms emanating from it made their scalps tingle, leaving them no time to heal.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A Secret Realm  was destroyed.</p><p>The aftermath violently swept in all directions.</p><p>"Careful!"</p><p>Lu Boyuan shouted a warning.</p><p>Hanxi's reaction was also quick. Coordinating with Lu Boyuan's combined attack secret art, it spat out a ball of frigid light, but its target was themselves.</p><p>The frigid light enveloped them, transforming into a solid ice coffin, sealing them inside.</p><p>The next moment, the aftershock arrived.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The ice coffin was sent flying far away, with a series of cracking sounds. Cracks spread all over it, and the next moment, it disintegrated into countless fragments, some of which were stained with blood.</p><p>Two figures shot out from the fragments.</p><p>Lu Boyuan and Hanxi were in a sorry state, but fortunately, their lives were not in danger. Moreover, using the force of the impact, they successfully rushed out of the Inner Palace and plummeted towards the Outer Palace without stopping.</p><p>At this moment, they finally had the mind to observe their surroundings.</p><p>The Immortal Palace pierced through the void, carrying a world-destroying power. Looking at the scene above, the fear in their eyes lingered, their souls still unsettled.</p><p>Their gazes shifted, and the Azure Platform  under the spatial storm came into view.</p><p>Seeing the figures on the Azure Platform, and the scene of everyone vying to ascend, they couldn't help but be stunned.</p><p>They were both of excellent intellect. Seeing this scene, and associating it with the anomalies in the Immortal Palace, even without knowing the purpose of the Ascension Platform , they could vaguely guess a thing or two.</p><p>The man and the lizard exchanged a glance, incredibly shocked.</p><p>"I've implicated you."</p><p>Hanxi regretted it.</p><p>If Lu Boyuan had been present, he would have also had a chance to be on the Azure Platform.</p><p>To help it find restorative elixirs, Lu Boyuan risked great danger and ventured into the Ancient Medicine Garden with it. Although they successfully obtained the immortal medicine, he was injured and exhausted, unable to ascend the platform.</p><p>The only chance of 'Ascension'  in the cultivation world for countless years was missed because of this!</p><p>Lu Boyuan did not blame him for it. He stared at the Azure Platform and shook his head, saying, "Not necessarily! There may be variables later..."</p><p>Before he finished speaking.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>A black shadow heavily crashed to the ground.</p><p>Lu Boyuan and Hanxi, who were attracted by the Azure Platform, were startled by the sound. Turning their heads to look, they only saw a round, furry ball. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the Feather King  in his original form.</p><p>Lu Boyuan admitted that his strength was not as good as the Feather King's, but the Feather King looked much more miserable than they did.</p><p>The Feather King's demon body was originally incomparably magnificent, comparable to a divine bird.</p><p>At this moment, his entire body was covered in blood and filth, devoid of luster. Moreover, there was a missing patch here and a bald spot there, dripping with blood, a terrible sight.</p><p>The most serious injuries were to his wings, which were limp. The left wing was even broken, turning into several sections, with only a piece of flesh connecting them.</p><p>When had the Lord of the Heavenly Demon Hill  ever been so embarrassed!</p><p>The Feather King rolled around on the ground a few times, staggered to his feet, and his figure suddenly stiffened.</p><p>Six eyes met.</p><p>The Feather Demon King  tidied up the few remaining feathers on his head, greeted them calmly, and also noticed the scene on the Azure Platform.</p><p>After gazing for a moment.</p><p>The Feather King's expression changed slightly, and a strong regret flashed in his eyes. Although this trip had been fruitful, missing this opportunity could not be compensated for no matter what.</p><p>If he had not been lured by the immortal medicine in the Ancient Medicine Garden and suffered such severe injuries, he would definitely have been a member of the Azure Platform at this time!</p><p>However, there were even more miserable endings than theirs.</p><p>A burst of bloody light erupted from the Inner Palace of the Ziwei Palace from time to time. Those who had not escaped yet would never leave, falling here with the treasures on their bodies!</p><p>Each their own fortunes , nothing more than that.</p><p>...</p><p>On the Azure Platform.</p><p>Ye Laomo , Bai, and Qingjun stood on one side of the Azure Platform.</p><p>True Oneness Daoist , Canghong Zhenren, and Tongyou Mojun stood on the other side.</p><p>Everyone was silent. It was already very difficult for them to gain a foothold here, and they still had to deal with the dangers ahead, so they had no intention of fighting.</p><p>Qingjun and Bai paid no attention to external affairs.</p><p>They controlled the Jade Bone , slowly moving towards the spatial storm.</p><p>Since they could not kill the Jade Bone Demon Head  with their own power, they would use external forces!</p><p>Ye Laomo coldly watched True Oneness Daoist and the other two.</p><p>In the process of struggling, Jade Bone screamed madly, trying his best to bewitch them.</p><p>If anyone was moved, they would have to get past Ye Laomo first.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>The firmament trembled.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace flew higher and higher.</p><p>The shadow covered most of the Inner Palace.</p><p>Everyone was shocked by this magnificent scene, staring blankly as the Ziwei Palace pierced through the void.</p><p>This secret realm, once regarded as the number one treasure land in the Northern Chen Domain , would leave them forever.</p><p>The Immortal Palace descended into the mortal world, but there would eventually be a day of return!</p><p>Finally, the Ziwei Palace flew over the Azure Platform, touching the edge of the spatial storm.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The aftershock was as tangible, and the naked eye could clearly see a huge halo spreading around.</p><p>From their position, they could only see the edge of the Inner Palace of the Ziwei Palace, and it was not very clear. But they could guess how terrifying the destructive power of the Immortal Restriction  and the spatial storm would be.</p><p>The outer palace was being impacted, and the collapse was accelerating.</p><p>The power of the Azure Platform storm instantly increased several levels.</p><p>The first to show signs of weakness was Tongyou Mojun.</p><p>His style of doing things had always been steady, planning before acting, and rarely taking risks. After hesitating for a moment, he looked at the people on the platform, jumped off the Azure Platform, knowing when to quit.</p><p>'Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Deafening roars drowned out all sounds in the world.</p><p>Everyone's heart was beating along with it, their expressions extremely nervous.</p><p>Jade Bone ultimately failed to break free from control, struggling in vain, flying towards the spatial storm.</p><p>The roar was barely audible.</p><p>His figure was as small as an ant in the face of the vast spatial storm.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Jade Bone's bones were extremely hard. Even after being close to the spatial storm and being impacted by the aftermath, he did not turn into ashes on the spot.</p><p>If the Jade Bone Demon Head had not been suppressed by the Demon Binding Lock  and the Heart Demon Puppet Seal , he could probably have walked out of the spatial storm alive even if he fell into it.</p><p>Qingjun changed his hand seals, and actively destroyed his puppet, adding to Jade Bone's woes. Destruction was only a matter of time.</p><p>At this time, another person was eliminated from the Azure Platform.</p><p>The most important protective magic treasure of Canghong Zhenren had been severely damaged by Ye Laomo before and had not yet recovered. Having experienced the power of spatial turbulence up close, he knew that the opportunity was not great. He sighed inwardly and gave up decisively.</p><p>Only True Oneness Daoist remained!</p><p>"Old ox-nosed Daoist, why don't you hurry down! Do you really want to die here?"</p><p>Ye Laomo taunted.</p><p>The millennium scheme was about to succeed, and he suddenly felt like talking, "Back then, Ye regarded you as my lifelong rival, but unexpectedly you went to become the leader of that Heavenly Walk Alliance . Ask yourself, you claim to have compassion and protect all living beings, but haven't you also been intoxicated by power? If there was an opportunity to be the leader of the Northern Chen Alliance , you would take it without hesitation, wouldn't you?" </p>
