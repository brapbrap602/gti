Chapter 693: The Second Transformation


“Just ahead lies Siming Island. If all goes well, after bypassing it, we'll reach Huntian Island in about two months!”
The journey by boat wouldn't typically take this long, but Qinsang had taken many detours. Along the way, as expected, he had witnessed several skirmishes along the sea routes, each of which he had avoided in advance, prioritizing his journey.
Of course, he'd also encountered attacks from great demons. Those he could kill, he did; those he couldn't, he used the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman to escape.
The reason he stopped here was twofold: firstly, both his body and mind were exhausted and he intended to rest for a few days. Secondly, after consuming countless spiritual medicines, the Sky-Eye Butterfly had finally reached the peak of its first transformation and was ready for its next evolution!
A light flashed at his dantian, and the Sky-Eye Butterfly flew out, fluttering around Qinsang before finally landing on his shoulder, conveying a sense of intimacy.
The blue light on the butterfly's wings shone even brighter, and the patterns became even more beautiful.
Qinsang smiled faintly and flipped his hand, taking out the Redfire Gold.
Smelling the Redfire Gold, the Sky-Eye Butterfly suddenly took flight, darting to Qinsang's hand and hovering excitedly above the jade bottle, eager to devour it.
Knowing it would aid the butterfly's transformation, Qinsang was naturally not stingy. He opened the jade bottle and poured a drop of Redfire Gold into his palm.
The Sky-Eye Butterfly immediately swooped down joyfully and began to consume it bit by bit.
The Redfire Gold visibly shrunk as the butterfly swallowed it all. Still seemingly unsatiated, Qinsang poured out another drop.
He remembered that when Elder Dique had fed a drop of Redfire Gold to each of the two Fire Jade Centipedes, both spirit insects had begun their transformations. It seemed the Sky-Eye Butterfly had a much larger appetite.
It might also have something to do with their individual natures.
Before receiving the Redfire Gold, the Fire Jade Centipedes had reached the peak of their first transformation long ago, stuck at the bottleneck for many years, so their transformations were easier than the Sky-Eye Butterfly's.
After finishing the second drop of Redfire Gold, the Sky-Eye Butterfly became languid, slowly flapping its wings as it landed in Qinsang's palm.  It then nestled against Qinsang's finger and fell asleep.
Qinsang held the Sky-Eye Butterfly for a while, but didn't observe any signs of transformation. He wasn't worried, though.  Taking advantage of the butterfly's slumber, he began to meditate and adjust his breath.
For several days, whenever the Sky-Eye Butterfly awoke, Qinsang would feed it Redfire Gold, supplementing it with a few other spiritual medicines he had prepared beforehand that were beneficial for transformation.
On the evening of the third day, the eyes on the Sky-Eye Butterfly's wings suddenly 'opened', emitting a celestial blue light.  A hazy blue glow enveloped the butterfly.
In the deep night, starlight reflected on the shimmering sea surface, and the Sky-Eye Butterfly looked like a blue star.
The butterfly slept within the celestial blue cocoon of light, its wings folded together, also forming a cocoon shape.
Qinsang grinned silently, marveling that the Redfire Gold was indeed a divine medicine. The Sky-Eye Butterfly had entered its transformation! Shaking the jade bottle, he saw plenty of Redfire Gold remaining, enough for the butterfly's third transformation.
He himself was also sufficiently rested.  Storing the Sky-Eye Butterfly within his dantian, allowing it to transform in peace, he set off on his journey once more.
…
Two months later.
In a desolate area of the sea, despite the clear weather and lack of storms, massive waves occasionally surged, accompanied by the clang of metal and furious shouts.
A closer look revealed that in the heart of the waves, over a dozen figures were locked in battle, various magical artifacts colliding back and forth, interspersed with a few strange-looking insect shadows.
It was clearly a clash between human cultivators and witch cultivators, engaging in a fierce battle after some disagreement.
The battle was raging.
Suddenly, a streak of light appeared in the distant sky. Moments later, the owner of this light seemed to notice the battle and abruptly stopped, observing from afar.
The cultivators on the battlefield also noticed the approaching light, and both sides became hesitant.
They had initially been evenly matched, each with their own hidden agendas. While the human cultivators were slightly disadvantaged, they weren't without their trump cards. This newcomer, if powerful, could instantly change the tide of battle.
Considering this, both sides simultaneously gathered their respective cultivators, wary of the mysterious person in the distance.
Unexpectedly, at this moment, the streak of light brightened again, aggressively charging straight towards the battlefield. The speed of this person's flight caused the cultivators on both sides to change their expressions.
“Core Formation stage… Not good, it's reinforcements for the humans!”
Among the witch cultivators, an elderly man who was clearly the leader, his face drastically changed. “Retreat!”
In contrast, the human cultivators' spirits were greatly boosted. They attacked with all their might, relentlessly pursuing and entangling the witch cultivators, preventing them from escaping easily.
The mysterious person quickly arrived.  The witch cultivators, having lost all will to fight, fled in disarray after a chaotic skirmish, leaving behind several corpses.
The human cultivators pursued them for a while, but seeing that they couldn't eliminate more, they finally gave up the chase.
“Many thanks, fellow Daoist, for your righteous assistance. I am Han Cuo,” the leader of the human cultivators, a middle-aged man with a square face and imposing demeanor, who usually appeared dignified and awe-inspiring, now spoke amicably, cupping his hands towards the young man opposite him. “Fellow Daoist, so young yet possessing such high cultivation, I admire you!”
This young man was Qinsang.
After a long journey, he finally arrived near Huntian Island.  Discovering unrest there as well, after some contemplation, he decided to first contact the island's cultivators and inquire about the situation.
He had observed that the cultivators in the battle were not particularly powerful, with only a few early Core Formation stage experts and the rest being Foundation Establishment stage cultivators, so he revealed himself to scare away the witch cultivators.
“I am surnamed Qin. Fellow Daoist Han flatters me. My cultivation method is unique and has a youth-preserving effect, which is why I appear young,” Qinsang said indifferently.
He didn't wear a cloak, mask, or any such disguise, but revealed his true appearance.
In this situation, being secretive could easily arouse suspicion. Qinsang had previously concealed his identity to guard against the Li Witch Palace, but there was no need for that within the Demonic Sea.
Han Cuo was momentarily taken aback but didn't delve into it further.  He introduced Qinsang to the other cultivators.
The others also thanked Qinsang and proactively offered him a portion of the spoils, which Qinsang accepted without hesitation.
After becoming acquainted, Han Cuo sized Qinsang up. “Fellow Daoist seems unfamiliar. You must have arrived at Huntian Island recently?”
“Indeed,” Qinsang said with a wry smile, glancing around. “I was hunting demons on other islands when sudden chaos erupted. I decided to risk coming to Huntian Island, but unexpectedly… this place isn't peaceful either.”
Han Cuo chuckled. “With the war between the two races, where can one find peace? If fellow Daoist seeks a safe haven, it’s not difficult. Just go to Huntian Island itself. The Island Lord strictly forbids fighting there; the island and the outside are two different worlds.”
“Oh?”
Qinsang’s gaze swept over the group. “If that’s the case, why haven’t you fellow Daoists gone to the island?”
Han Cuo replied meaningfully, “With risk comes opportunity. What others fear, I embrace. As for them… the area outside Huntian Island is actually more dangerous. Their cultivation is too low. Because they were a step too slow, now they dare not attempt to go to the island, forced to remain outside. However, with fellow Daoist’s strength, reaching Huntian Island safely shouldn’t be a problem.”
