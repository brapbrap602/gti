<h1>Chapter 2044: The Ju Fu</h1><p>Upon seeing Elder You, it was clear he was much more enthusiastic than their last meeting, inviting Qin Sang to sit in the same stone pavilion as before.</p><p>"I have been awaiting Elder Qin for some time…"</p><p>Elder You presented two jade caskets, pushing them towards Qin Sang. "Please, examine these two items."</p><p>Qin Sang, already harboring a guess, waved his hand, opening the caskets. Within one rested numerous glittering golden seeds, resembling a handful of golden melon seeds. From the rounder end of each seed extended delicate lines, forming the pattern of flower petals, even outlining the calyx.  Quite peculiar, occasional sparks of electricity danced across the petals.  These were indeed the Gold-Veined Grass Seeds.</p><p>The other casket contained a mass of hazy, ethereal substance, like a wisp of gentle breeze, seemingly ready to disperse at the slightest touch. This was the Ethereal Wind.</p><p>Both were items Qin Sang required. Elder You had previously mentioned the Alliance possessed them, but Qin Sang hadn't expected them to be produced so readily.</p><p>The quantity of spiritual materials within the caskets was more than sufficient.  However, although tempted, Qin Sang didn't reach for them.  He raised his head, looking at Elder You.</p><p>"Elder You, what is the meaning of this?"</p><p>As a Guest Elder, when favored, one was naturally treated as an honored guest, but such favors were usually inconsequential. Qin Sang knew himself; he hadn't yet earned the right to have the Five Elements Alliance simply gift him these two items.</p><p>That Elder You presented them before even mentioning any conditions naturally aroused Qin Sang's suspicion.</p><p>"Haha, Elder Qin's arrival is most timely," Elder You explained with a relaxed demeanor. "The Alliance recently received a commission and is currently recruiting. A few days ago, I reported Elder Qin's matter to the higher-ups. An edict has been issued, instructing me to extend this invitation to you. Should you agree to this undertaking, these two items will be your reward, regardless of success or failure.  And if successful, the client might even bestow further generous gifts."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the two jade caskets. Such a reward was undoubtedly precious, but it also implied this task wouldn't be easy.</p><p>"What kind of commission is it?" Qin Sang inquired.</p><p>"Those who seek out our Five Elements Alliance naturally come for refining. Rest assured, Elder Qin, there will be no danger.  However, the treasure the client wishes to refine is likely of utmost importance, and they are being very secretive. Even the Alliance is unaware of its nature. Only after Elder Qin agrees and arrives at their sect will you be informed," Elder You explained.</p><p>Hearing it involved refining rather than some perilous exploration, Qin Sang's expression softened slightly. As an outsider, agreeing to treasure hunts with others could easily lead to being manipulated without his knowledge. Unless absolutely necessary, he would never place himself in such precarious situations.</p><p>The two treasures were enticingly displayed. Qin Sang wouldn't deny his interest, but he needed to understand the situation more clearly. After a moment of thought, he said, "I am a newcomer.  My skills haven't been tested. Such a secretive and handsomely rewarded task…why would it fall to me? Is there some hidden complication? Or is the client difficult to deal with?"</p><p>"There's no need for any testing. Who would dare question the refining prowess of a Five Elements Alliance Guest Elder?  And there's no need to worry about the client. They cultivate profound Daoist arts, certainly not some demonic path. As for hidden complications, it's as I just said, the client, due to certain concerns, requires someone with untainted origins. Most of the Alliance's elders don't meet this requirement.  A few recommendations have been rejected by the client, causing considerable trouble.  We were already considering recruiting from the outer Celestial Provinces," Elder You said with a look of helplessness.</p><p>Untainted origins?</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Though Elder You didn't explicitly state it, it wasn't difficult to guess. If untainted origins were the requirement, no one fit the bill better than him, an outsider with no connections to any factions within the Kan Province.</p><p>"So much left unsaid! What are the requirements for the refining process? How long will it take? Surely these can be disclosed?  What if I'm trapped there for too long, delaying my own affairs?"</p><p>Though his words carried a hint of dissatisfaction, Elder You could tell Qin Sang was swayed.  He immediately retrieved a jade slip.  "All the information is within this slip."</p><p>Simultaneously, Elder You placed a contract on the table.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it, carefully reviewing its contents.  After a moment of contemplation, he gave a nod of agreement, signed the contract, and with a wave of his sleeve, collected the two jade caskets. "I'll undertake this task.  Which sect is this client from?"</p><p>Elder You was overjoyed. "It's the Luo Hua View. A True Person from Luo Hua View is waiting outside. I'll summon him to meet with Elder Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, recalling a name he'd seen on a sea chart. "A Daoist sect?"</p><p>"Precisely!" Elder You nodded.</p><p>With the Divine Court's decline, most Daoist sects in the Great Thousand Worlds followed the Cauldron and Furnace lineage. Due to his connection with the Talisman lineage, Qin Sang naturally felt an affinity towards Daoist sects, finding them easier to deal with than demonic cultivators.</p><p>Elder You relayed the order.  Shortly after, a servant girl led in a young Daoist priest.  With his Daoist topknot and jade hairpin, he possessed a clear and refined air, evidently at the late Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>"This humble Daoist, Yu Hong, greets the two seniors," True Person Yu Hong bowed, maintaining a composed demeanor even before two Void Refinement cultivators.  His gaze shifted to Qin Sang.</p><p>"This is Elder Qin. He has already signed the contract.  As for when to return to the mountain, you can discuss that amongst yourselves. I won't intrude further."</p><p>Elder You rose to leave, then suddenly recalled something, turning back to Qin Sang.  "I have already issued orders to the Alliance's various branches to inquire about the other spiritual materials you require.  Please be patient, Elder Qin. Upon returning from Luo Hua Mountain, there should be good news."</p><p>"Many thanks for your efforts, Elder You!"</p><p>Qin Sang rose to see him off, then returned to the pavilion, inviting True Person Yu Hong to sit.  "Does your sect have any other requirements of me?"</p><p>"No other requirements. May I ask when Elder Qin can depart?" True Person Yu Hong sat upright.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, asking a few more questions.  Seeing True Person Yu Hong's tight-lipped nature, he said, "Allow me to return and make some arrangements.  We'll depart tonight."</p><p>Leaving True Person Yu Hong at the Five Elements Alliance, Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling, awakening his Sword Servant. "I've been invited to refine a treasure for someone, and I estimate it might take some time. Stay in Xu Wei City and keep an eye on the Five Elements Alliance for me."</p><p>That night, Qin Sang and True Person Yu Hong departed Xu Wei City together.  After several transfers, they arrived at an Immortal City named Yan Ling.</p><p>The Immortal Cities of Kan Province were all built on islands, often with one island comprising a single city.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang learned about the local customs of Kan Province.  While safety was generally guaranteed within the Immortal Cities, the same couldn't be said outside their walls.</p><p>In the vast ocean, the deaths of a few individuals barely caused a ripple.</p><p>Major powers established their own sects outside the Immortal Cities, becoming local overlords. Conflicts frequently arose between these factions, and the Immortal Cities rarely intervened.</p><p>Luo Hua View was situated outside Yan Ling City.  Leaving the city, the two flew for several days before a range of towering mountains emerged from the sea ahead.  Lush green forests stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><p>What were called islands in Kan Province, some appeared no different from continents to cultivators from smaller worlds.  Innumerable mortals lived here, forming nations and countless Daoist temples, all under the governance of Luo Hua View.</p><p>The island was rich in vital energy and brimming with spiritual essence.  The beings residing here were perpetually bathed in this energy. Mortals possessed keen eyesight and agile bodies.  Through generations of refinement, their constitutions gradually transformed, making them more likely to produce individuals with exceptional talent.  These individuals were then inducted into the Immortal Sect, ensuring the continuation of their lineage.</p><p>In the eyes of sect powers, this was a superior breed, a carefully cultivated human population, also possessing considerable value for trade.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately slowed his flight, intending to glean some experience from Luo Hua View for managing his own Daoist establishment.  Since they were nearing the sect, True Person Yu Hong didn't urge him, patiently following behind and answering any questions Qin Sang posed.</p><p>Luo Hua View's governance appeared orderly and efficient. Daoist priests flew back and forth, each attending to their duties.  From the population alone, it was evident that Bi Shui Village, with its shallow foundations, couldn't compare to Luo Hua View.</p><p>A glimpse into a single aspect revealed the whole.  This was the foundation of a renowned sect.</p><p>Qin Sang mused that Luo Hua View wasn't considered a top-tier sect in Kan Province.  Rumor had it their current Sect Master was only at the late Void Refinement realm. He couldn't imagine the grandeur of those at the Body Integration or even Great Ascension realms.  His own path was long and arduous.</p><p>Mid-flight, Qin Sang saw peculiar peaks rising ahead, wreathed in immortal clouds, exuding an ethereal aura.  In the distance, a vast lake stretched endlessly. Several Daoist temples nestled among the mountains were faintly visible. All these sights were veiled by an inexplicable energy.</p><p>"Elder Qin, that is our sect," True Person Yu Hong flew up, leading the way.</p><p>Before they could enter the mountains, the sound of a chime resonated, followed by the rumbling of water.  A ribbon of water shot out from amidst the peaks, cascading towards them, forming a watery path that reached their feet.  Then, accompanied by celestial music, troops of celestial maidens in feathered robes and flowing garments, holding zithers, lutes, and pipas, approached, gliding across the water.</p><p>Behind them, powerful warriors stood guard on either side.</p><p>At the forefront of the procession was an elderly man, exceptionally tall and robust, yet possessing a refined air. He bowed to the two, his voice resonant.</p><p>"Greetings, True Person Yu Hong.  This esteemed True Person must be Elder Qin.  The Sect Master has been awaiting you in the Profound Water Hall for some time."</p><p>This person seemed to hold a high position within Luo Hua View. True Person Yu Hong stepped aside, avoiding the bow. "Thank you, Fellow Daoist Mi, for leading the way."</p><p>"Esteemed True Person, please."</p><p>Elder Mi maintained a respectful demeanor, waiting for Qin Sang to step onto the watery path before turning to lead the way.</p><p>The water path led directly to the Profound Water Hall deep within Luo Hua View.</p><p>Traveling along this path, the scenery of the sect was fully visible. The disciples of Luo Hua View, seeing the flowing water above, knew honored guests had arrived. They offered distant greetings, respectfully watching the procession pass before returning to their tasks.</p><p>However, what caught Qin Sang's attention wasn't the scenery or the disciples, but rather Elder Mi and several unusually tall warriors.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that as Elder Mi moved, his wrists occasionally emerged from his sleeves, revealing grey hair significantly thicker than a human's. Moreover, his skin bore peculiar tattoos, different from the Witch Tribe's divine markings. Whether they were innate or applied later, Qin Sang couldn't tell.</p><p>Those warriors were clearly of Elder Mi's race.  Some wore only armor, and through the gaps in the plates, Qin Sang saw both their arms were covered in tattoos. The tattoos appeared similar amongst them.  Their torsos were heavily muscled but lacked tattoos.</p><p>Particularly striking were their exceptionally thick and powerful arms.</p><p>Aside from the tattooed arms, the abundant hair, tall stature, and unusual appearance, they didn't appear drastically different from humans.</p><p>Recalling Elder You's words, Qin Sang spoke. "Forgive my boldness, but Fellow Daoist Mi, you are not human?"</p><p>Elder Mi replied, "Your honor, we are descendants of the Ju Fu clan."</p><p>True Person Yu Hong offered an explanation.  "The Ju Fu clan is a tribe of Exalted Ones. Long ago, this particular branch was expelled from the Sea of Mists for reasons unknown.  While drifting at sea, they encountered one of our sect's ancestors, who took them in and brought them to the mountain.  They willingly pledged their loyalty to Luo Hua View, and the Sect Master permitted them to serve within the sect."</p><p>Elder Mi said respectfully, "We are grateful for the sect's benevolence, granting our clan a place to settle and protecting our continued existence."</p><p>Qin Sang thought that Elder You's words indeed held true.  Although Elder Mi was of a different race, judging by True Person Yu Hong's attitude towards him, he seemed to enjoy the Sect Master's trust and wielded considerable authority.</p><p>"The Ju Fu clan…"</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized Elder Mi and his kinsmen again.</p><p>He observed that the Ju Fu clan possessed robust physiques, yet their faces had a somewhat pointed, ape-like appearance.  This was more pronounced in Elder Mi, who showed signs of age.  A thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  "I once encountered the Zhang You clan of your Exalted Ones. They possess four ears, lack these tattooed arms, yet bear some resemblance in appearance.  Is there a connection between your two clans?"</p><p>"The Zhang You clan?"</p><p>Elder Mi pondered briefly, then nodded. "Within the Exalted Ones, our Ju Fu clan does have some related tribes, among which I believe there is one called the Zhang You clan. However, according to oral traditions passed down from our elders, among the Exalted Ones, aside from the perpetually prosperous Feathered Folk and Merfolk, other tribes also experience periods of rise and decline. Before our branch was expelled, our clan seemed to have lost contact with the Zhang You clan. Perhaps they migrated elsewhere, or perhaps they have already declined.  We only know the name now."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.  The Zhang You clan couldn't even conquer the Storm Realm, so it was unlikely they were particularly prosperous.</p><p>As they spoke, the group arrived at the end of the water path. A magnificent jade hall stood before them, and an otherworldly old Daoist priest stood at its entrance.</p><p>Seeing the old Daoist, Qin Sang's heart trembled slightly.</p><p>This person's energy was as deep as the sea, reminding Qin Sang of Island Master Meng whom he'd encountered on his journey to the Great Zhou.  However, facing such a powerful individual now, Qin Sang felt much more at ease than before.</p><p>Each generation's Sect Master of Luo Hua View adopted the Daoist title Luo Hua upon assuming leadership.  This person was undoubtedly True Person Luo Hua.</p><p>True Person Luo Hua laughed heartily, flicking his dust whisk.  "I feared that inviting Elder Qin openly would create too much commotion and attract unwanted attention. Please forgive any lack of propriety."</p><p>"Sect Master is too kind!"</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto solid ground at the end of the water path, giving a slight bow.  They exchanged greetings and proceeded towards the hall together.</p><p>Before entering, Qin Sang sensed several powerful auras.  He knew Luo Hua View hadn't invited him alone; other fellow Daoists must be within.</p><p>True Person Yu Hong and the others remained outside.</p><p>True Person Luo Hua glanced back.  "I noticed Elder Qin has no attendants and seemed somewhat interested in them.  This Ju Fu clan possesses unique abilities. Do they catch your eye, Elder Qin?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, pausing his steps. "Is the Sect Master willing to part with them?"</p><p>He glanced back at Elder Mi.  Despite being offered as a gift, Elder Mi displayed no sign of humiliation. The other members of his clan even puffed out their chests, eager to be chosen, not viewing it as shameful, but rather as an honor.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. It seemed this clan had been completely subdued by Luo Hua View, their spirit long broken.</p><p>"To follow Elder Qin is their good fortune," True Person Luo Hua said indifferently.</p><p>"Let us discuss the main matter first. We can address this later."</p><p>Qin Sang gave a noncommittal response, not refusing outright.  He considered that bringing along a couple of Ju Fu clansmen might prove useful in the future, potentially providing leverage regarding relations between the two clans.</p>
