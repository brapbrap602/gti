<h1>Chapter 891: Dark Thunderwood</h1><p>Chapter 891: Dark Thunderwood</p><p>“Sister Fang, Brother Zhao, please!”</p><p>Huasheng smiled, inviting the two inside.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao was a shrewd man.</p><p>Huasheng had heard from Fang Ting that after joining the sect, Zhao Songqiao had shown great interest in her, frequently visiting. Initially, Fang Ting was wary of this old man, but later, seeing that he was genuinely harmless and had even helped her with a few small things, and being a fellow disciple, she lowered her guard.</p><p>She had mentioned to Zhao Songqiao in passing that Huasheng was a true disciple of the Yin-Yang lineage of the Lan Dou Sect, and unexpectedly, Zhao Songqiao asked her to arrange an introduction.</p><p>Fang Ting couldn't refuse, so she brought Zhao Songqiao along when she visited last month.</p><p>Huasheng had seen this sort of thing many times before.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao, as a solitary cultivator, had painstakingly cultivated to the thirteenth level of Qi Refinement, forging such a resilient spirit; he must have experienced the harsh realities of life. Huasheng didn't harbor ill feelings toward Zhao Songqiao's attempts to gain favor, but wouldn't become overly friendly either, maintaining a polite distance.</p><p>The three entered the room and sat down.</p><p>Huasheng brewed some spiritual tea, observed their expressions, took a sip, and calmly asked, “Sister Fang, is there something you need this time?”</p><p>“Brother Zhang, you can tell?”</p><p>Fang Ting looked surprised, then her nose wrinkled, showing a troubled expression.</p><p>This made Huasheng secretly curious. Fang Ting had a straightforward personality; during her previous visits, she had rarely shown such hesitation.  He wondered what the matter was.</p><p>“Hehe, sister's worries are written all over your face. With Brother Zhang's keen observation skills, how could I not notice?”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao suddenly chuckled, looking at Fang Ting and saying, “Sister Fang, if you find it difficult to speak, since this concerns me, let me explain it to Brother Zhang.”</p><p>“Alright, Brother Zhao, please do.”</p><p>Fang Ting nodded, seemingly relieved.</p><p>Huasheng simply looked at the two curiously, without speaking.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao sat up straight, his expression slightly serious, and said, "Brother Zhang, as a true disciple of the Lan Dou Sect, you must know about the Dongming Island Dharma Assembly.”</p><p>Huasheng paused slightly, setting down his teacup and asking, “Brother Zhao, why are you asking about the Dongming Island Dharma Assembly?  The Yanmiao Pavilion should be sending disciples as well, shouldn't they?”</p><p>“That's right, but only true disciples are permitted. I don't qualify. At the Dharma Assembly, the true disciples of various sects will compete in martial arts, and it would be greatly beneficial for me to observe the Foundation Establishment stage seniors of various sects, in order to advance my own cultivation.”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao sighed, and before Huasheng could respond, he changed his tone, "Fortunately, Sister Fang agreed to take me to Dongming Island to observe the Dharma Assembly."</p><p>Huasheng looked at Fang Ting, not surprised. Given Fang Ting's status, no one from the Yanmiao Pavilion would likely object.</p><p>However, Fang Ting hadn't seemed particularly close to Zhao Songqiao when she mentioned him before.</p><p>Huasheng was curious how Zhao Songqiao had swayed Fang Ting.</p><p>“Is Elder Chen taking you?”</p><p>Fang Ting shook her head, somewhat helplessly saying, “Originally, Master was leading the team to Dongming Island, but Master has been in seclusion…”</p><p>Huasheng chuckled softly.</p><p>The feud between Elder Chen and Daoist Huayang was certain; it seemed Elder Chen wouldn't emerge from seclusion until he broke through to the mid-stage of the Nascent Soul realm and faced Daoist Huayang.</p><p>“Then congratulations, Brother Zhao! You are the most advanced cultivator among our batch of disciples, and Elder Chen also holds you in high regard. After the Dharma Assembly, you will surely break through. Among us, Brother Zhao should be the first to reach Foundation Establishment.”</p><p>Huasheng offered his congratulations, without mentioning the earlier matter.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao waved his hands repeatedly. Seeing Huasheng's tactful approach, he continued, “Brother Zhang, you will soon break through to the tenth level of Qi Refinement; then you’ll understand how difficult Foundation Establishment is. At my age, I've failed countless times and have given up hope. To be accepted by the Yanmiao Pavilion is a unique opportunity in my life, one I must seize. I implore you to help me!”</p><p>Seeing Zhao Songqiao's behavior, Huasheng was puzzled and said, “Brother Zhao, I’m completely confused. I didn't enter the sect before you, and my cultivation is inferior to yours. How can I help you?”</p><p>“Brother Zhang, have you ever learned about Dongming Island?”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao asked Huasheng to seal his cave’s restrictions before whispering, “It’s no secret within Lan Dou Island that the island is quite unique, abundant in Wood-type spiritual energy, especially suitable for the growth of spiritual herbs and trees, requiring no attention from cultivators. After various sects discovered Dongming Island, they divided it amongst themselves, with the Lan Dou Sect controlling the largest and richest area.”</p><p>The heart of the island, however, is Longxing Mountain at the center of Lantou Island.  It's said to contain many rare medicinal herbs, so valuable that even high-level cultivators are tempted, nearly causing a major conflict.  Later, the various sects established rules, jointly sealing off the island.  It's only opened during the Dongming Island gathering, allowing access for herb collection. The allocation of herbs is said to be related to the performance of each sect's disciples at the gathering…”</p><p>Huasheng listened quietly to Zhao Songqiao’s words. He had already investigated Dongming Island thoroughly.  The island only opens infrequently and is considered forbidden territory, but Huasheng felt it was unlikely to be connected to Douniu Peak. Nevertheless, he would seek an opportunity to search the island.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao’s account matched what he’d already learned.  Lantou Sect couldn't keep all the herbs from Longxing Mountain; the Dongming Island gathering was a way to appease the other sects.</p><p>Huasheng intently studied Zhao Songqiao. This fellow knew so much about Dongming Island… could he have designs on Longxing Mountain?  Even his true self wouldn't dare attempt such a reckless act; Longxing Mountain is heavily guarded. Trespassing on Longxing Mountain is practically suicide!</p><p>“…Besides Longxing Mountain, each sect cultivates their own spirit trees and herbs within their designated areas.  Supposedly, their quality is far superior to those grown elsewhere.”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao paused, bowing slightly. “Your sect possesses a grove of Dark Thunderwood on Dongming Island.  As a true disciple working under Elder Jinyan, Junior Brother Zhang must be aware.  I would be grateful if you would allow me to enter this grove with you.”</p><p>“The Dark Thunderwood grove?” Huasheng was surprised. “Brother Zhao, you know about that, too?”</p><p>Dark Thunderwood is a type of dark, ink-colored wood, resembling acacia.  Its unique quality is a faint trace of dark thunder energy within, useful in crafting flying swords and other magical weapons, enhancing their power compared to similar items.  However, this thunder energy is very weak and diluted, only effective for low-level cultivators.</p><p>Lantou Sect does indeed possess a sizable Dark Thunderwood grove on Dongming Island. Elder Jinyan mentioned that a batch of mature trees should be ready for harvest.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao shook his head repeatedly.  “The valuable herbs outside Longxing Mountain have long been harvested, leaving only ordinary medicinal plants. What each sect grows is hardly a secret.”</p>
