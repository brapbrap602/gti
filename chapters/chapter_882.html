<h1>Chapter 874: Apprenticeship</h1><p>Apprenticeship?</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He shook his head repeatedly, saying, "Fellow Daoist, you jest. Even if we wanted to join the Azure Citadel Sect, they wouldn't accept us."</p><p>"Indeed."</p><p>The burly man sighed. "We are already Foundation Establishment cultivators. Unless it's a very special circumstance, those renowned sects won't take us in.  If we truly harbored some ulterior motive, we wouldn't be able to pass through the Path of the Heart."</p><p>"Path of the Heart?"</p><p>Qin Sang heard this term for the first time.  Upon inquiring, he learned it was a method the Azure Citadel Sect used to select disciples. Even their inner disciples had to walk the Path of the Heart after reaching Foundation Establishment.</p><p>In most sects, Qi Refining disciples are called outer disciples. Without reaching Foundation Establishment, they can never truly rise in status. Foundation Establishment disciples are the core strength of the sect, and their selection must be handled with care.</p><p>Major sects don't take in core disciples lightly.  They all have similar methods.</p><p>Some even start this process during the selection of outer disciples.  However, the sects Qin Sang had previously joined were quite unusual and didn't have such practices.</p><p>The Gloomy Yin Sect recruited people to find sacrifices for the Yama Banner. As long as the conditions were met, they would accept anyone.</p><p>The Yuan Zhao Sect held the Ascension Ceremony to offer blood sacrifices to a crumbling secret realm. To entice more rogue cultivators to join, they wouldn't set any other barriers.</p><p>Those selected into the sect weren't valued at all. They were used as laborers, burdened with heavy tasks and stringent demands. They had no prospects and were kicked out once they reached a certain age.</p><p>If it hadn't been for Yu Hua, bribed by the Gloomy Yin Sect, Qin Sang would have been worked to death in the Yuan Zhao Sect, with no time for cultivation.</p><p>Mount Shaohua did have similar methods. However, Qin Sang entered with the Sword Intent Decree.  This kind of selection happened after outer disciples reached Foundation Establishment and had their jade talismans replaced.</p><p>But Qin Sang's method of reaching Foundation Establishment was unique, unprecedented.</p><p>Not only did he become connected with a Core Formation elder within the sect, but he was also personally granted medicine by the Nascent Soul ancestor.  The sect leader observed the whole process, astonished, and didn't dare to use such a method on him.</p><p>By a strange twist of fate, he had never experienced this Path of the Heart.</p><p>Of course, even if Qin Sang had walked the Path of the Heart, he wouldn't have revealed any flaws. Protected by the Jade Buddha, such methods were useless against him.</p><p>Joining the Azure Citadel Sect was just a joke, and both of them knew it was impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  He would probably only be able to learn about Qi Yunzi by contacting the Azure Citadel Sect's disciples.</p><p>The trouble was, since the demonic disturbance, the Azure Citadel Sect's leader had also gone to the Demonic Sea. The sect was practically closed off, and core disciples rarely went out.  Even in the Azure Citadel Sect's market, it wasn't easy to encounter them.</p><p>And, as the burly man said, the Azure Citadel Sect wouldn't let outsiders freely browse their true inheritances.  Even if he found that inheritance, obtaining it would be another problem.</p><p>The burly man said excitedly, "I used to commission a refining master from the Azure Citadel Sect. He was extremely arrogant and charged exorbitant prices, but his refining skills were far inferior to Fellow Daoist Mingyue's.  Fortunately, he's holed up in the Azure Citadel Sect these days.  A friend recommended me to seek you out, so I travelled a great distance.  Otherwise, I would have missed this opportunity!"</p><p>Hearing the burly man consider meeting him an opportunity, Qin Sang smiled faintly and sent him away, lost in thought.</p><p>A moment later, he strode out of the quiet room, gave the attendant an instruction, and hurriedly left.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't return to his cave until the evening of the following day. Looking at his avatar, his eyes flickered.  He had spent the day investigating the Azure Citadel Sect and its affiliated sects' recruitment schedules.</p><p>He learned that the Azure Citadel Sect opened its doors for recruitment every twelve years. Unfortunately, they had just recruited a batch of disciples this year, and the next opportunity would be twelve years later.</p><p>Initially disappointed, Qin Sang then learned that among the sects affiliated with the Azure Citadel Sect, there was one called the Misty Smoke Pavilion that would soon hold a recruitment ceremony. Many rogue cultivators were already heading there to prepare.</p><p>Although the Misty Smoke Pavilion wasn't as powerful as the Azure Citadel Sect, it had a deep foundation, with several Core Formation experts.  Affiliated with the Azure Citadel Sect, they thrived and could be considered a renowned sect.</p><p>During his conversation with the burly man, an idea had sprung up in Qin Sang's mind. He himself would have difficulty being accepted by the Azure Citadel Sect, but his avatar had a clean background and might have a chance to infiltrate it.</p><p>After Qin Sang brought his avatar into the market, the avatar had remained secluded in the cave, cultivating and never interacting with outsiders. Their relationship hadn't been exposed.</p><p>The avatar's real name was Zhang Yue, and he had a clean background, originally a cultivator born and raised on Heron Island.</p><p>After occupying this body, Qin Sang, both for closure and peace of mind, had properly arranged Zhang Yue's affairs.  Before leaving, he told his parents that he was leaving to seek the Dao.</p><p>Thus, Zhang Yue's identity was preserved.</p><p>His background was very clear.</p><p>He wouldn't fear inquiries.  The sword soul within the avatar inherited some of the Jade Buddha's power.  These sects wouldn't use overly violent methods on newly recruited disciples, as it could cause irreparable hidden injuries.</p><p>Unless a Nascent Soul ancestor was present, the avatar's identity would be difficult to expose.</p><p>If it were infiltrating the Azure Citadel Sect, Qin Sang would hesitate.  But the Misty Smoke Pavilion didn't have cultivators powerful enough to see through his avatar's disguise.</p><p>The Misty Smoke Pavilion had a close relationship with the Azure Citadel Sect. This roundabout approach might take more time, but it was still a viable path.</p><p>His true body could remain outside, investigating in secret.</p><p>Cooperation between inside and outside would offer a greater chance of success.</p><p>Qin Sang's biggest concern was that his avatar lacked strength and wouldn't be able to react to danger. If the mission failed and he lost his avatar, he would regret it immensely.</p><p>"So be it, fortune favors the bold!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face hardened, his resolve firm.</p><p>The *Demonic Transformation Scripture* was as important as the avatar.  Neither could be dispensed with.  It was worth taking a gamble.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wouldn't act rashly. He would provide his avatar with enough life-saving measures.</p><p>The most useful were treasures like the Fire Pearls and Void Thunder, with terrifying power and instantaneous detonation, leaving the enemy no chance to dodge.  But those were already used up. The next best option was to prepare more Soul Devouring Cones.</p><p>There was no shortage of demonic corpses here.</p><p>Qin Sang's refining skills were far superior to what they once were.  He was confident in refining the Soul Devouring Cones to a level that would frighten even False Core Realm cultivators.</p><p>The Soul Devouring Cones were more than enough to deal with ordinary dangers.  If he were targeted by a Core Formation cultivator, however, they would be somewhat inadequate.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and decided to have the Heaven's Eye Butterfly accompany his avatar.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly was proficient in concealment and illusion, even better at hiding than the avatar. It could deceive everyone.</p><p>After obtaining the lightning manipulation divine ability, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly wasn't weak either. It should be able to hold off a Core Formation cultivator for a while, long enough for his true body to arrive.</p><p>After sending his avatar away, his true body wouldn't stray too far.</p><p>The Green Cicada Coins' power hadn't been exhausted and could still be used. He would have his avatar carry them for timely warnings.</p>
