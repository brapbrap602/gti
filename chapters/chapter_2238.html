<h1>Chapter 2228: Misconception</h1><p>Tong Shen Ren's urgency was evident in his voice; even abandoning the mountain gate indicated the crisis wasn't limited to Yuan Jing Mountain.  The situation had likely drastically changed.</p><p>“Master, my parents…”</p><p>Despite being in an illusion where her family was unreal, Qin Sang needed to appear filial and devoted before Tong Shen Ren.</p><p>“Disciple, you needn't worry. The Golden Eagle Clan shouldn't involve ordinary people, but I will transfer them to a safe place.  Unfortunately, my abilities are limited, and I can't protect more of our kin.”</p><p>Tong Shen Ren sighed, then addressed his senior disciple, “Qing Yan, you also go and settle your family, then rendezvous with me.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Qing Yan left first.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Qing Hong beside her.</p><p>“Master said my parents died of illness before he found me,” Qing Hong said flatly, looking at Frost. “What about your family, Frost?”</p><p>Frost shook her head, her expression somewhat sad.</p><p>“Master, what exactly is happening outside?” Qing Hong asked, she and Qin Sang still bewildered.</p><p>“The various races are planning a major action, rumored to target human cultivators. We'll likely struggle to remain in Golden Eagle territory.  Fortunately, Daoist Lu has good information; the Golden Eagle Clan hasn't acted yet, giving us time. Otherwise, we'd only realize the danger when the demons surrounded the mountain!”</p><p>While speaking, Tong Shen Ren sent out several talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang asked, “Master, is it related to those portraits?”</p><p>“Perhaps, perhaps not.  One thing is certain: our situation is becoming increasingly precarious.  The world is vast, but where can we find refuge?”</p><p>Tong Shen Ren called Qing Hong over, giving her a jade pendant.  “Go quickly! Daoist Lu is contacting other Daoists. We'll create some illusions to mislead the Golden Eagle Clan, just in case… Be careful on your journey, avoid patrolling demon soldiers, and use this treasure for protection if you encounter danger.”</p><p>“Master, you must also be careful,” Qing Hong worriedly said.</p><p>Tong Shen Ren nodded and left.</p><p>“Junior Brother, Frost, only the three of us remain; you must follow my orders!” Qing Hong stated unequivocally.</p><p>Qin Sang had no objections, neither did Frost, as Qing Hong had the highest cultivation among them.</p><p>Qing Hong's tone softened, “Don't be too nervous. Since Master dared let us act alone, the situation hasn't worsened. We just need to avoid the demon soldier patrols. Let's go!”</p><p>Qin Sang had the lowest cultivation among the three; Qing Hong and Frost were both Golden Core cultivators. They took turns using their artifacts to carry Qin Sang, traveling nonstop.</p><p>Along the way, Qing Hong detailed the route Qing Yan had explored.  Even if they were separated, they could find their way to each other.</p><p>Qin Sang knew Tong Shen Ren had foreseen this day. Their destination was a temporary cave; ultimately, he would lead them to the sanctuary created by humans and the descendants of gods.</p><p>She hadn't expected this day to come so soon. Qin Sang guessed that many other human cultivators might have also ended up there, making it easier to find old acquaintances.  The only drawback was her current low cultivation.</p><p>They were still within Ling Kong Mountain's range.  Traveling west from Yuan Jing Mountain, they remained surrounded by endless mountains.</p><p>Qing Hong was optimistic, constantly finding ways to tease Qin Sang and Frost while they traveled.</p><p>Frost was quiet, but even she couldn't resist Qing Hong’s enthusiasm, answering her questions and allowing Qin Sang and Qing Hong to get to know her.</p><p>With increased interaction, they realized that while Frost wasn't outwardly warm, she didn't shut people out.</p><p>Frost's master was Daoist Lu's junior sister, who died unexpectedly under unsolved circumstances. Daoist Lu then took Frost, his junior sister’s only disciple, under his wing and cared for her deeply.</p><p>Learning Frost’s background, Qing Hong felt a kindred spirit, quickly addressing her as “sister”.</p><p>“We’re about to leave the young eagle king’s territory…”</p><p>After several hours of flight, Qing Hong pointed ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang and Frost looked and saw the mountain range abruptly ending, a fissure appearing in the earth, its origin unknown, forming a natural boundary.</p><p>“Further ahead, the land becomes increasingly barren. Few Golden Eagle cultivators would come here. A few minor demons settled here in recent years, occupying a few plots of land.  These demons are weaker than me, not a concern.  Beyond this area, it’s even more desolate and barren. Though not occupied by Golden Eagle cultivators, it's the border of Ling Kong Mountain and the Golden Eagle Clan territory; there will be demon soldiers patrolling…”</p><p>This was Qin Sang’s first time leaving Yuan Jing Mountain; Frost rarely ventured out. Both listened intently to Qing Hong.</p><p>“How strong are the demon soldiers?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Qing Hong, familiar with the route, led them on a detour, skillfully navigating through the territories of the Golden Eagle Clan’s cultivators.  A previous visit with her master had shown her that the patrolling demon soldiers were only at the peak of the Lingming Realm, suggesting the Golden Eagle Clan used this area to train their younger generation.  After all, antagonizing the Golden Eagle Clan meant antagonizing the Phoenix Clan, and to the Golden Eagle Clan, this was a remote backwater, insignificant enough to be considered outside of Lingkong Mountain; otherwise, they would have been expelled long ago.</p><p>Their journey was uneventful until they reached a noticeably desolate region.  The mountains were primarily rocky, with sparse vegetation struggling to survive in the crevices.  Initially, patches of desert were interspersed; gradually, the sandstorms intensified, transforming the land into a barren wasteland where even animals were scarce.</p><p>“Here we are!”</p><p>Flying over a sand dune, Qing Hong whispered, immediately descending to the ground.  Miss Shuang and Qin Sang followed suit.  They concealed themselves between two dunes. Qing Hong produced a jade pendant given to her by Master Tong Shen, lightly touched it, and three beams of white light shot out, enveloping the three of them.  Their presence vanished.  Qin Sang saw Qing Hong and Miss Shuang transform into the color of the sand and blend seamlessly with the dunes.</p><p>It was a remarkable concealment artifact, Qin Sang thought.</p><p>“Don’t move!”</p><p>Qing Hong’s voice reached him.  Qin Sang remained motionless, his gaze fixed upward.  Soon, four dark spots appeared on the horizon, quickly approaching.  They were four golden eagles, soaring high above, their sharp eyes scanning the surroundings, completely oblivious to the three people hidden below.  Once the eagles disappeared, Qing Hong exhaled, put away the jade pendant, and turned to Miss Shuang.  "Miss Shuang, did you sense anything?”</p><p>“Two of them were far stronger than I am,” Miss Shuang replied.</p><p>Qing Hong nodded.  “One was about as strong as Big Brother. Usually, patrols consist of three golden eagles; I don’t know why there’s an extra one…”</p><p>With that, the three continued their journey.  The road ahead was long. According to Qing Hong, this desolate land was vast; during her previous trip with her master in search of a spiritual herb, they had flown for over ten days without reaching the end.  The terrain varied constantly—sometimes rivers, sometimes desert. They followed the route Qing Yan had explored. They encountered demon soldiers twice more, easily avoiding them with the jade pendant.</p><p>“It’s been ten days, and still no news from Master and Big Brother…”</p><p>The days' experiences had eased their vigilance.  As they flew, they chatted casually.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Shijie. Master is so powerful; nothing will happen to her!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s reassurance wasn’t entirely insincere; he still depended on his master.</p><p>“You’re so sweet, no wonder Master likes you so much,” Qing Hong teased Miss Shuang.  “Miss Shuang, be careful whom you trust, lest your heart be stolen.”</p><p>“Sister Qing Hong, what are you saying!”</p><p>Miss Shuang's cheeks flushed slightly.</p><p>“I see you’re clever. You must understand that I mean you should watch out for this good junior brother of mine…”</p><p>Qing Hong pointed playfully at Qin Sang, but her words were cut short by a sudden tremor.  Qin Sang, lacking the cultivation to detect it, noticed the change in Qing Hong and Miss Shuang's expressions.  Both women looked towards the south.</p><p>The tremor, though subtle, was unusual; it wasn't a simple earthquake, and it filled them with a sense of unease.</p><p>“No good, here we go again!”</p><p>Before they could determine the source, they sensed the presence of demon soldiers.  Misfortunes struck one after another.</p><p>Below lay a rocky mountain range. Qing Hong quickly scanned the area, signaling for them to land on one of the mountains and seek shelter in a hidden crevice, activating the jade pendant.  The pendant perfectly concealed them within the rocks.</p><p>Moments later, three dark spots appeared on the horizon—three golden eagles.  Being on the ground, they felt the tremor more intensely, growing stronger and stronger.  While Qing Hong and Miss Shuang were still uncertain, Qin Sang's eyes showed a grave expression. He deduced from the frequency and change in the tremors that their source was rapidly approaching, at an incredible speed.</p><p>“Could it be…?”</p><p>A bad feeling washed over Qin Sang.  Could they be witnessing a battle between powerful cultivators? If caught in the crossfire, a single ripple of energy could turn them to ash.</p><p>It was too late to dodge.  The tremors were heading straight for them.  Even with Qinghong and Miss Shuang's speed, escaping the battlefield was impossible.  And with golden eagles patrolling the skies, revealing their position would attract a swarm.</p><p>"What's that?"</p><p>In a flash, Qin Sang heard Qinghong's exclamation.  Looking south, he saw a towering crimson plume erupting into the sky.</p><p>It looked like a volcanic eruption, a column of fire shooting into the heavens, staining the sky red.</p><p>Three golden eagles clearly saw the phenomenon and circled hesitantly.</p><p>Before the crimson plume could fully explode, however, fiery orbs appeared out of thin air. These blazing infernos were even brighter than the plume, instantly forming a sea of fire that scorched the heavens.</p><p>Endless flames licked at the sky.  Even from a distance, the terrifying heat was palpable.</p><p>Qinghong and Miss Shuang were stunned.  They had never witnessed such power.  Against this force, even the esteemed Tong Shen and Mr. Lu would likely be helpless, reduced to ashes by a single spark.</p><p>"It's definitely powerful beings battling!  Could it be human cultivators fighting against the Golden Eagle tribe?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. Judging by the scale, the combatants were at least Metamorphosis stage cultivators, possibly even Void Refinement.</p><p>He frowned, a deep sense of powerlessness washing over him.  Forces he once disregarded could now easily destroy him.</p><p>What would happen if he died in this illusion?</p><p>The thought suddenly occurred to Qin Sang.  Would it restart his life? Would it affect his real body? Or even worse, would it lead to his death?</p><p>He realized he'd underestimated the danger of this illusion.  He couldn't escape, so he could only pray they wouldn't approach.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's pupils constricted.  He witnessed a shocking sight.</p><p>Amidst the flames, a golden light erupted, revealing a gigantic claw.</p><p>The claw, like a celestial pillar, descended towards the crimson plume.</p><p>Qinghong and Miss Shuang were terrified by this monstrous claw, but Qin Sang was deeply shaken.</p><p>He had seen a similar sight before, during the beast tide, when an Ying Shao tribe strongman used this exact technique!</p><p>The Ying Shao tribe existed in ancient times, of course. But that strongman fused their innate ability with a powerful artifact to achieve this. Its reappearance in the illusion—was it really just a coincidence?</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The earth trembled. The crimson plume burst.</p><p>The celestial phenomena were too chaotic for Qin Sang and the others to discern what had happened, let alone who had won.</p><p>The tremors rapidly approached, like the earth's pulse, affecting their minds.</p><p>Suddenly, the tremors stopped.</p><p>Fiery waves surged in the horizon, the sea of fire churning.</p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p>A maniacal laugh echoed from the inferno, followed by several streaks of light that vanished into the sky.</p><p>"Whew!"</p><p>Seeing this, they breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>"There was more than one person. Was the Ying Shao strongman among them? Did they win or lose?"</p><p>What puzzled Qin Sang was that, protected by the jade Buddha, he'd realized he was in an illusion the moment he arrived. Yet, someone had seen through it even earlier, regaining Void Refinement strength in just two years—impossible through normal cultivation.</p><p>Was it extraordinary talent, or something else?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't pursue them. Besides being unable to catch up, even if the victor was the Ying Shao strongman, they might not be friendly.  It would only put him in danger.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly realized he might be mistaken.</p><p>In the illusion, everything around him, including space, was illusory.  Time could also be false.</p><p>Though they were pulled into the illusion simultaneously, they might not be in the same era.  Someone might have lived in this illusion for decades, or even centuries.  They were all geniuses from different tribes with sharp minds.  After so much time, seeing through the illusion wouldn't be strange.</p><p>If that were the case, the situation would be far more complex.  Perhaps Liuli hadn't even been 'born' yet. Qin Sang felt a huge headache coming on.</p><p>Of course, these were just Qin Sang's speculations, but he had to consider this possibility.</p><p>From now on, he needed to carefully conceal his identity and try to approach an 'awakened' cultivator from another tribe.</p>
