<h1>Chapter 2051: The Water and Sky Divisions</h1><p>Qin Sang observes the brothers, Qinggao and Qingyi, both now at the peak of the early Yuan Realm stage.  Their cultivation, similar to the Golden Core stage, has its own gradations.  While they've recently advanced to this level, they are still some distance from their next breakthrough.  Observing their training, Qin Sang senses changes within them, noting that their ancestral clan's cultivation technique can be seen as a body-refinement method. However, unlike human force cultivation techniques, their practice involves constantly circulating their blood essence and infusing it into their arms.</p><p>Their arms are like bottomless pits, constantly absorbing blood essence, but not wastefully so.  A mysterious transformation occurs within their arms, eventually replenishing their bodies and preventing depletion.  This ceaseless circulation allows their cultivation to increase incrementally with each cycle.</p><p>"This must be what the Yi people call continuously refining innate abilities, seeking the origin of their ancestors. The innate abilities are the foundation of their Dao, considered their lifeblood…"</p><p>Qin Sang muses that the Yi people's cultivation methods are indeed unique. The existence of legendary Zu Realm cultivators among them suggests they've mastered this path, finding a way of cultivation through their innate abilities.</p><p>After observing for a while, he awakens the brothers and asks several questions about the Ju Fu clan, to which they readily respond.  Qin Sang then produces a jade vial. "Try refining the Si Huan paste inside."  Si Huan paste is a pill that aids human cultivators in body refinement.</p><p>The brothers thank Qin Sang for the gift. Opening the vial, they inhale the potent fragrance. Qinggao sniffs, sensing the medicinal properties. "Reporting to Master, we believe we can refine this Si Huan paste! While at Luohua Temple, our clan performed meritorious service.  The pills bestowed by the temple's high priest were mostly human force-cultivation pills, regarded as treasures by our clan elders."</p><p>They sit cross-legged, applying the paste as instructed by Qin Sang, circulating their blood essence. The medicinal power gradually penetrates and is refined, resulting in a significant improvement in their cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang nods and commands, "Now, engage each other in combat, using only your innate abilities."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Qinggao and Qingyi stand opposite each other. Raised together since childhood, their training and teachings have been identical. They raise their right arms, joints cracking as muscles tense. The black markings on their arms gleam, radiating an eerie black light, with strange energy flowing.</p><p>They extend their hands, grabbing at each other. Ripples appear in the air, followed by a loud bang.  A visible wave of spiritual energy erupts between them, dissipating before spreading.</p><p>Qin Sang observes, recalling the brothers' descriptions of their clan's abilities. He recognizes their technique—the Sky-Tearing Palm—learned after breaking through to the peak of the early Yuan Realm stage.  It allows them to seize opponents from a distance and even restrain spells.</p><p>As the Yi people's cultivation improves, in addition to the transformations stemming from their innate abilities, their clan also has secret techniques based on these abilities.</p><p>After some time, Qin Sang dismisses them. This training is preparation for the upcoming Misty Sea expedition. He reflects that the Yi people, unlike human cultivators, are formidable opponents.</p><p>Most human cultivators practice the Five Elements Dao. By identifying their foundation, one can generally anticipate their subsequent moves, except for those from major sects.</p><p>This is not the case with the Yi people. Different clans possess different innate abilities. Encountering unfamiliar Yi people renders prior experience useless.</p><p>Su Nu's notes mention this as well: some Yi people possess exceptionally powerful abilities that defy logic.</p><p>While the Ju Fu clan's abilities are discernible, indicating a connection to their arms, other Yi people's abilities are impossible to judge externally, requiring improvisation.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully reviews the jade slips then appears in the small pocket dimension within his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang has explored the pocket dimension whenever possible.  Due to the limited time he could spend there in each visit, and the many times he has entered, only one area remains unexplored.</p><p>He heads straight for the tallest peak, encountering a high altar. This altar is the most unique place in the entire dimension. Qin Sang saved it for last, hoping to find clues elsewhere. However, he has already explored the other structures without success.</p><p>It seems that before the Qianjun Ring was destroyed, the pocket dimension was already abandoned.</p><p>Time is pressing. Qin Sang quickly scans the altar, focusing on features unlike human architecture. After a moment, he appears atop the altar.</p><p>The altar is remarkably intact.  If so, its power might still remain.  However, after sensing it, he finds no place for spirit stones.</p><p>Cultivators at the Transcendent Void stage can manipulate spirit stones with their bare hands, but that doesn't mean spirit stones are useless.  In many situations, such as activating spirit arrays and special magical artifacts, spirit stones remain irreplaceable.</p><p>"Could it require a ritual and offerings?"</p><p>Qin Sang considered the Witch Clan's heritage but didn't immediately go out. He sat cross-legged, connecting his consciousness to the high altar.</p><p>Suddenly, a natural phenomenon occurred, and the void became unstable. Qin Sang quickly withdrew his consciousness, not daring to linger.</p><p>In the originally empty chamber, Qin Sang's figure silently reappeared, returning to the greater world.</p><p>When he retreated into his small secluded world, the greater world vanished without a trace, leaving only an invisible, hidden marker.  Before his small secluded world became violently unstable, as long as no fluctuations leaked out, outsiders would find it difficult to detect. Qin Sang carefully confirmed this, so he believed that when facing danger, he could escape into his small secluded world for safety.</p><p>Gently stroking his Qianjun ring, Qin Sang fell into thought. He had just tried to activate the high altar without triggering anything unusual, but he had gained an understanding; it seemed something was missing.</p><p>"Could it be necessary to cultivate corresponding techniques to activate this altar?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, recalling the feeling from that moment. It felt like the altar itself was incomplete.</p><p>"Perhaps there are other altars, echoing each other, forming a complete whole. Whether this altar is the primary or secondary one remains unknown."</p><p>After much deliberation, Qin Sang decided to ignore it for the time being.</p><p>If the altar remained silent, it would have no impact on the small secluded world. If something unusual happened, it would indicate the existence of other fragments, perhaps another chance encounter.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't yet understand what it meant to refine a secluded world into a magical artifact, but he was certain that if he could gain some insight into it in the future, he would greatly benefit!</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang took out the jade slip containing the records of the "Luo Hua Dream Interpretation" and continued his study.</p><p>In the third month after Qin Sang arrived in Wumian City, Gu Ya rushed into the inner hall, triggering the chamber's restrictions. Hearing Qin Sang's inquiry, she replied, "Senior Su Nu has sent a message!"</p><p>The chamber automatically opened, and Gu Ya entered, presenting a talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang reached out and took it, breaking the seal to see the contents. His gaze flickered slightly.</p><p>Su Nu hadn't told them when Qin Sang planned to leave when she was preparing for that matter.</p><p>Recently, Su Nu saw Gu Ya's message and learned that Qin Sang was already in Wumian City. She immediately sent a letter indicating an address and urging Qin Sang to leave quickly and meet her.</p><p>Such urgency—had Su Nu encountered some trouble?</p><p>It was likely related to what Su Nu had done before. Unfortunately, the letter didn't specify, and they didn't know what it was.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the address, located in a place called the Zhuo Lang Sea Area in Lansha Prefecture.</p><p>Time was of the essence. Qin Sang stood up, saying, "Are the arrangements at this manor complete? Let's set off today for Lansha Prefecture. We may not have time to return later."</p><p>"So soon?"</p><p>Gu Ya was startled, immediately realizing that something might have gone wrong with Su Nu, and repeatedly said, "Everything is ready, but there are a few minor matters. I'll arrange them right away."</p><p>Gu Ya hurried back to the lakeside, gathering all the disciples.  Her gaze swept across their faces, settling on an elder, "Hu Qi, come with me."</p><p>Hu Qi obeyed, following Gu Ya to an inner courtyard.</p><p>This small courtyard had previously been a forbidden area of the manor, strictly prohibited from any disciple.</p><p>Turning around, Gu Ya said to the anxious Hu Qi, "I will be leaving Wumian City with the senior, and I don't know when I will return.  You will be in charge of this manor and instruct the disciples in cultivation."</p><p>Hu Qi was shocked and terrified.  Knowing the hardships of unaffiliated cultivators, he thought he would be abandoned again and knelt down, "Disciple will diligently cultivate, please, Master, don't…"</p><p>Gu Ya saw through his thoughts, smiling wryly, and waved her hand to stop him, "Where did you get that idea? Once you enter our doors, you are disciples of the Xu Ling sect. It's just that the time hasn't come yet to bring you back to the sect.  This manor is actually very important…"</p><p>She pointed to the closed door, "Inside is a great formation. You will be responsible for guarding it.  In the future, if there are any orders from the sect, a spiritual light will appear in the formation, and you must obey.  This responsibility is significant. You must prioritize guarding the formation and discipline the other disciples."</p><p>Hu Qi's expression relaxed, and he quickly said, "Disciple will diligently guard, never leaving the manor!"</p><p>Gu Ya nodded and took out several jade slips, two of which were sealed, "These are subsequent cultivation techniques. If you break through to the Nascent Soul stage and I haven't returned, you can cultivate them yourself. These two jade slips contain the cultivation insights of our sect's ancestors, but remember not to be greedy; only when your cultivation reaches the appropriate level can you open the seals."</p><p>She had poured a lot of effort into the Xu Ling manor. If the Storm World ceased to exist, this would be the only remaining line of the Xu Ling sect.</p><p>Having arranged everything, Gu Ya hurried out of the manor. Qin Sang and Jian Nu were already waiting. The three left Wumian City, clouds forming beneath their feet as they flew towards the East Sea.</p><p>There is no teleportation array between the City of Sleepless Nights and Blue Sand State, so they could only travel by flight.</p><p>Grand Ascension cultivators rarely appear in the world unless a major event occurs.  Even those at the Unity stage seldom travel, making Nascent Soul cultivators the peak of what ordinary people consider possible. Qin Sang only needed to release a wisp of his aura; no one dared to disturb him.</p><p>Flying eastward from the City of Sleepless Nights for over ten days, after crossing a vast expanse of ocean, the islands suddenly became dense, with numerous cities, markets, and cultivators, indicating they had entered Blue Sand State.</p><p>Because of its proximity to Kan State, they only encountered human cultivators.</p><p>Su Nu had already sent a map of Blue Sand State.  Qin Sang, therefore, avoided the trouble of scouting, identified the location of the Turbid Wave Sea, and rarely stopped along the way, finally arriving at his destination.</p><p>The Turbid Wave Sea is under human control, but they frequently saw妖修  and other non-human races coming and going openly.  Human cultivators had become accustomed to it.</p><p>Blue Sand State is far less stable than Kan State.  Along the way, Qin Sang and his companions encountered countless magical battles; conflict was everywhere, and many cultivators carried a violent aura. If not for Qin Sang's aura deterring troublemakers, they might have been drawn into several fights.</p><p>Of course, Blue Sand State also has many safe areas, such as the Turbid Wave Sea, mostly controlled by large sects and powerful factions.  Those who offend their authority face certain death.</p><p>Unsure of Su Nu's safety, upon entering the Turbid Wave Sea, Qin Sang left Jian Nu and Gu Ya waiting in a celestial city while he went to meet her alone.</p><p>Following the instructions on the message, Qin Sang quickly arrived at a small market town.</p><p>Before entering, he observed from the outside.  The cultivators on the island were coming and going, everything seemed normal, and he found no abnormalities. He then entered the market and arrived at a courtyard.</p><p>As soon as he touched the barrier, the courtyard gate swung open, and Su Nu's surprised voice rang out, "Qin Xiong, you're so quick! This will make things much easier!"</p><p>Entering the courtyard, Qin Sang saw Su Nu gracefully welcoming him. After examining her, and seeing that her aura was full and she had no injuries, he was relieved.  He asked, "You urgently summoned me. Did you encounter any trouble?"</p><p>"I'm just scouting, so I wouldn't have made enemies without reason," Su Nu smiled. "Come inside, Qin Xiong. I've discovered something interesting, and I need your opinion."</p><p>After settling down, Su Nu said, "Qin Xiong, you must have seen the message I sent back, right?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I've also gathered some information over the years, though not as detailed as what you've found in Blue Sand State.  What else have you discovered?"</p><p>Su Nu responded, "To establish themselves in the Great Thousand World, different non-human tribes, while considering themselves a single race, view humans and妖族  as external enemies.  When faced with threats, they unite against the common foe.</p><p>"However, the non-human races are not united. Each tribe is a separate power, unwilling to be controlled by others. Simultaneously, these tribes will also cooperate to secure benefits for themselves, inevitably leading to disputes.</p><p>"The two largest forces are the Water Tribe and the Sky Tribe, encompassing over 90% of the tribes. The Water Tribe is led by the Merfolk, while the Sky Tribe is ruled by the Feather People.  The two are not at peace and often clash.</p><p>"The Water Tribe's territory is closer to Kan State, which is why we mainly encounter them in Blue Sand State. Only a few know the name of the Changyou Tribe, but their location is unknown. I suspect the Changyou Tribe is located deep within the fog sea, within the Sky Tribe territory, and is far from being a major tribe…"</p><p>Qin Sang agreed with Su Nu's deduction, and mused, "The task we're about to undertake is related to this?"</p><p>Su Nu nodded. "Exactly!  I recently learned that two individuals, possibly from the Sky Tribe, have appeared in Blue Sand State, but they seem to be in considerable trouble."</p>
