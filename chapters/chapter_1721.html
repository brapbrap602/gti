<h1>Chapter 1712: Nascent Soul </h1><p>Inside the fire chamber.</p><p>A ball of demonic fire danced above Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>The normally violent demonic fire appeared docile as water before Qin Sang, its aura restrained within a small space. Even if someone stood before him at this moment, they would not sense any threat.</p><p>Within the demonic fire, a Celestial Platform slowly revolved.</p><p>Each rotation sent out ripples, but under Qin Sang's exquisite control, the ripples quickly subsided, making the refining process exceptionally stable.</p><p>This Celestial Platform was the core of the tribulation-crossing formation—the Taiji Celestial Platform.</p><p>Compared to the one he had seen in the Ice Instrument Palace, this platform's form was more complete. The forty-nine grooves along the outer edge, meant for the Icefire Tokens, were all present. Only the Yin and Yang poles remained unformed, their runes flickering, and the glow of restrictions fluctuating.</p><p>The Ice Instrument Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Horn hovered on either side of the demonic fire.</p><p>A chilling aura extended from the Ice Instrument Divine Disc, connecting to the Yin pole. Similarly, a crimson thread linked the Fire Rhinoceros Horn to the Yang pole.</p><p>The energies of the two treasures slowly poured in.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the Celestial Platform at the heart of the demonic fire, his hand seals changing continuously. He meticulously imprinted restriction after restriction, guiding the two diametrically opposed energies to circulate within the platform's spiritual channels.</p><p>If the Celestial Platform were considered a human body, the internal spiritual channels would be its meridians. The circulation of these channels, the connection of their vital energies, and their integration with the restrictive runes would continue until the treasure was fully formed!</p><p>Ten years ago.</p><p>Qin Sang had quickly refined the Icefire Tokens. The Taiji Celestial Platform, however, was more troublesome. After shaping the platform, Qin Sang entrusted his avatar with the task of arranging its spiritual channels, a process that took a decade to complete.</p><p>As time passed, one could see complex blue and red patterns forming on the platform's surface, centered around the Yin and Yang poles.</p><p>The patterns gradually spread across the platform, meeting in the middle. Under Qin Sang's precise control, they did not clash but instead extended into each other's territory. Finally, the blue and red lights intertwined across the entire platform, becoming indistinguishable before fading away completely.</p><p>The platform's spiritual light receded, and disc-shaped and jade pendant-shaped depressions appeared at the Yin and Yang poles. Placing the two treasures within these depressions resulted in a perfect fit.</p><p>"Hu..."</p><p>Extinguishing the spiritual fire, Qin Sang gently exhaled and examined the Taiji Celestial Platform before him.</p><p>Then, remembering something, he flipped his hand and consecutively shot out forty-nine streaks of light, each an Icefire Token. They slotted into the grooves along the platform's outer edge as the Ice Instrument Divine Disc and Fire Rhinoceros Horn returned to their respective positions.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>The Taiji Celestial Platform trembled slightly.</p><p>Two dazzling beams of light, one blue and one red, shot out from the Yin and Yang poles.  Following this, the forty-nine Icefire Tokens vibrated with a deep hum, as if trying to detach from the platform.</p><p>Qin Sang did not further activate the platform; otherwise, the Yin and Yang poles would manifest ice and fire pillars, initiating the tribulation-crossing formation.</p><p>His eyes gleamed with a strange light as he gazed at the platform for a long time, sensing the changes in its vital energy. His face was filled with satisfaction.</p><p>The tribulation-crossing formation was complete!</p><p>The Ice Instrument Palace had contained not only the tribulation-crossing formation but also a restriction that could record the tribulation scenes of their ancestors for future generations to study. Unfortunately, Qin Sang had not obtained this method.</p><p>Next, he only needed to place the tribulation-crossing formation in a suitable location and wait for the tribulation to arrive!</p><p>Storing the treasures, Qin Sang walked out of the fire chamber.</p><p>It was midday.</p><p>The sun shone brightly.</p><p>The scorching sun illuminated the Deer Wilderness.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly at the entrance of the fire chamber, surveying the entire Daoist compound. He slowly closed his eyes. Without using his divine sense, he felt a peculiar sensation of merging with heaven and earth, becoming completely oblivious to himself.</p><p>Five-elemental spiritual roots, Nascent Soul-level divine sense—all these advantageous conditions converged within Qin Sang. When seeking the Celestial Harmony, he quickly grasped the key after an initial period of confusion.</p><p>He achieved minor completion in just twenty years, and his progress in the past decade had been even more rapid.</p><p>Such speed would be unimaginable for others.</p><p>Of course, merely achieving a certain level of proficiency in Celestial Harmony was not enough to directly propel Qin Sang into the Nascent Soul realm. He still needed to spend a considerable amount of time comprehending the Great Dao, reflecting on himself, and seeking the opportunity for a breakthrough.</p><p>The key lay in the *Wusheng Moyin* .</p><p>Now, the *Wusheng Moyin* was nearing completion, only one step away from condensing the Devil Seal.</p><p>After years of careful contemplation, Qin Sang was certain it wasn't his imagination; the Unborn Devil Seal he was condensing indeed possessed extraordinary power!</p><p>In addition, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had been cultivating alongside Qin Sang. After completely refining the strange energy of the Near Dragon Saliva, supported by the Spirit Nurturing Art and various spirit medicines, it had reached the peak of the Late stage.</p><p>Since the main ingredient for the Azure Frost Pill remained elusive, and Qin Sang had discovered the secret of the Unborn Devil Seal, he stopped thinking about helping the Heaven's Eye Butterfly break through and focused his energy on himself.</p><p>A Fourth Transformation peak-level natal insect also possessed the ability to assist in breaking through realms.</p><p>With the completion of the tribulation-crossing formation, the various conditions for breaking through to Nascent Soul were essentially in place.</p><p>As his thoughts raced, Qin Sang's perception encompassed the entire Daoist compound, every plant and tree as clear as if right before his eyes.</p><p>His avatar, having completed its task, was recuperating in its cave dwelling.</p><p>The bamboo forest outside the cave dwelling was forbidden ground. No one in the Azure Ram Temple, including Shen Chen, dared to approach it without permission.</p><p>A gentle breeze rustled through the bamboo leaves, creating a serene atmosphere.</p><p>The Azure Ram Temple, built on the other side of the Deer Wilderness, was referred to as the Inner Temple by its disciples.</p><p>Qin Sang's perception revealed several cultivators within the Inner Temple's cave dwellings.  Gold Core disciples had emerged in the Azure Ram Temple, and several at the False Core realm were preparing for their breakthroughs.</p><p>Before these disciples entered the Deer Wilderness, Shen Chen would bring them to pay respects to their ancestor. Qin Sang had some impression of them.</p><p>But that was all.</p><p>Unless someone possessed exceptional talent and cultivated far faster than their peers, they wouldn't catch Qin Sang's eye.</p><p>The door to a stone chamber deep within the Inner Temple was tightly shut. This was Shen Chen's cave dwelling.</p><p>Several noteworthy events had occurred over the years.</p><p>With Shen Chen's advancement to the Nascent Soul realm, Qin Sang had passed the position of Azure Ram Temple Master in the Middle Continent to him.</p><p>Shen Chen was originally quite talented. While his avatar was traveling, it had fortuitously obtained pills that aided in breaking through realms. He sent them back to the Deer Wilderness, helping Shen Chen achieve his breakthrough.</p><p>However, Shen Chen's success on his first attempt at breaking through had surprised Qin Sang.  He had initially taken this disciple on a whim, valuing his refining talent, but hadn't expected him to be so successful.</p><p>The Azure Ram Temple in the Middle Continent now had a second Nascent Soul ancestor!</p><p>With Shen Chen around, the Azure Ram Temple's lineage was secure, and Qin Sang could become a hands-off leader.</p><p>The Cloud Roaming Sword had also undergone significant changes.</p><p>With continuous refinement using the *Ji Yuan Shu* , Qin Sang clearly felt that the Scorched Wood True Spirit was more stable than before and was gestating.</p><p>Another development concerned the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>After devouring the fire spirits of the Flowing Fire Illusion True Pool on Fire Rhinoceros Island, the Fire Jade Centipede had slumbered for many years. Upon awakening, it possessed the cultivation of Fourth Transformation Mid-stage.</p><p>Qin Sang then fed the fire spirits sealed by his avatar to the Fire Jade Centipede, allowing it to continue its slumber. He wondered if these fire spirits could push it to the Fourth Transformation Late stage.</p><p>Everything was developing in a positive direction.</p><p>His thoughts returned to the present.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly and walked down the stone steps. After a few steps, he heard rustling sounds from the bamboo forest. Suddenly, over a dozen greenish lines shot out, pouncing towards him.</p><p>The lines reached Qin Sang and emitted chirping sounds, then prostrated themselves at his feet.</p><p>These were the Earthbound Dragons raised by Su Zinan.  Qin Sang had removed their ferocious nature and kept them as guardian spirit beasts.</p><p>The Earthbound Dragons were very close to Qin Sang's aura. They lay on the ground, rolling on their backs, their chirps filled with urgency. Qin Sang smiled and flicked his fingers, sending out a few pills.</p><p>After snatching the pills, the Earthbound Dragons followed behind Qin Sang, sometimes in a line, sometimes scattered, frolicking amongst the bamboo.  Only when Qin Sang entered the bamboo hut did they return to their nests.</p><p>Inside the bamboo hut.</p><p>Qin Sang sat upright with a serious expression.</p><p>His divine sense looked inward, silently circulating the *Wusheng Moyin*.  Sensing the nearly formed Devil Seal, he continued his comprehension.</p><p>He cultivated in seclusion like this for ten years.</p><p>One day.</p><p>The spiritual energy around the bamboo hut suddenly became turbulent.</p><p>Qin Sang's face underwent bizarre changes, sometimes drained of color, deathly pale, sometimes covered in a layer of grayish-black aura, as if afflicted by demonic energy, terminally ill.</p><p>His aura fluctuated erratically, affecting the surrounding environment.</p><p>'Crash...’</p><p>The bamboo hut shook as a fierce wind swept through the bamboo forest, scattering leaves.</p><p>Sensing the aura emanating from Qin Sang, the Earthbound Dragons trembled in their nests.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely oblivious to the external changes, his mind entirely focused on the Devil Seal within him.  The time had come; he was ready to condense the seal today!</p><p>His obsession was yet unfulfilled, but Qin Sang disregarded it entirely, forcibly condensing the seal.</p><p>At this point, the Demonic Intent of the Heavenly Devil had become very thin. The Devil Seal was no longer in its embryonic form but had a complete structure, only lacking the final step. With his obsession incomplete, there were indeed many inconsistencies when circulating the cultivation technique. The Devil Seal was constantly on the verge of losing control, making the process extremely difficult.</p><p>The greatest danger was the triggering of inner demons, a loss of mental control.  But Qin Sang's spiritual platform remained clear, completely focused, unwaveringly pushing the secret art forward.</p><p>'Condense!'</p><p>He abruptly let out a low shout.</p><p>A booming sound resonated within his body.  Black and white colors alternated on Qin Sang's face, and demonic energy nearly erupted, but he immediately suppressed it, completing the final hand seal.</p><p>In an instant, the demonic energy subsided.</p><p>Within Qin Sang's perception, a square seal slowly rotated within him.  The Devil Seal was pitch-black and sinister, as if capable of absorbing everything, including the consciousness of its cultivator.</p><p>"It's finally done!"</p><p>Qin Sang had no time for sentimentality.  He immediately circulated his cultivation technique, comprehending the Devil Seal.</p><p>Just as he had sensed before, the Devil Seal was closely connected to him.  A slight touch of the Devil Seal caused the True Essence within him to vibrate.  Qin Sang had a premonition that the Devil Seal's power was even greater than he had anticipated!</p><p>The greater the Devil Seal's power, the more terrifying the hidden dangers within the process of attracting the Demonic Intent became, making him shudder with fear in retrospect.</p><p>It was too late to dwell on those thoughts now.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind returned.  After a moment of contemplation, he summoned the Heaven's Eye Butterfly and retrieved a jade box.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly seemed to know that its master was pondering important matters and perched quietly on his shoulder.</p><p>Opening the jade box, he revealed a crystal-clear spiritual fruit, the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit.</p><p>Smelling the fragrance of the Immortal Fruit, and with his mind connected to the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang once again comprehended the Unborn Devil Seal.  The palpitations became even clearer, as if about to burst forth!</p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p>Only his physical body lacked a bit of refinement.</p><p>But he had grasped the opportunity. There was no need to wait any longer!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang stood up abruptly.</p><p>Within the Azure Ram Temple, Shen Chen was cultivating when he suddenly heard his master's voice transmission.  His face showed surprise, then, as if recalling something, a mixture of shock and joy. He immediately rushed out of his cave dwelling, awakening the other disciples and leading them back to the lower courtyard.</p><p>When Shen Chen returned, he brought the Nether Moon Guards with him and saw Qin Sang's avatar standing behind him.</p><p>They ascended the Deer Wilderness and felt it tremble as it sped westward.</p><p>Arriving near the Storm Belt, a desolate wilderness ravaged by the Nine Calamities, the Deer Wilderness came to a halt. Then, ripples suddenly appeared in the surrounding void.</p><p>White clouds materialized out of thin air, forming a layer across the sky.</p><p>Then, waves appeared in the sea of clouds.</p><p>At the center of the sea of clouds, a Daoist compound with mountain peaks resembling dragons gradually materialized.</p><p>This was due to the deactivation of the Deer Wilderness's protective formation, leaving only the formation protecting its core.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body now appeared on the main peak of the Deer Wilderness, gazing up at the heavens and down at the earth.</p><p>The tribulation-crossing formation was placed here, connected to the spiritual veins. He was prepared to break through and face his tribulation within the Daoist compound!</p><p>"Quickly patrol the surroundings and drive away all unrelated individuals!"</p><p>A deep voice resonated in the Nether Moon Guards' ears.</p><p>The avatar led the group out of the Deer Wilderness, scattering in all directions to carry out the order.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>The avatar stood on a mountaintop not far from the Deer Wilderness, with Shen Chen and the Nether Moon Guards stationed in their respective positions.</p><p>Within the Daoist compound.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body sat cross-legged atop the Taiji Celestial Platform. The Icefire Tokens, Ice Instrument Divine Disc, and Fire Rhinoceros Horn were all in place.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly circled above Qin Sang's head, then suddenly transformed into a streak of light and shot into his brow.</p><p>The next moment, a thunderous roar erupted within Qin Sang.</p><p>A layer of black demonic energy surged from an unknown source, engulfing him. The Unborn Devil Seal within him had shattered!</p><p>Shattering the Seal, breaking through the realm!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The True Essence within Qin Sang boiled, as if his Qi Sea and meridians were about to burst, sending waves of pain through him.</p><p>But he was completely oblivious, experiencing the Celestial Harmony.</p><p>This sensation was like actively merging with heaven and earth, returning to his origin, yet without completely losing his own Dao. He was seeking the point of perfect harmony with heaven and earth, receiving feedback from the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang could clearly sense that the moment the Unborn Devil Seal shattered, the bottleneck loosened!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The jade box opened, and he placed the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit into his mouth.</p><p>The Immortal Fruit, the natal insect, the Unborn Devil Seal—the power of all these treasures erupted simultaneously.</p><p>In an instant, the previously somewhat blurry Great Dao became exceptionally clear. He finally grasped the profound truth!</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>Qin Sang laughed towards the heavens.</p><p>His voice shook the universe!</p><p>Dark clouds gathered above the Deer Wilderness, thunder rumbled, and the world's spiritual energy became incredibly violent. Within the roaring spiritual tide, the turbulent energy formed countless orbs of varying colors, drifting around Qin Sang and the Deer Wilderness, descending from the sky.</p><p>A terrifying pressure emanated from the main peak of the Deer Wilderness.</p><p>Even the Nascent Soul realm Nether Moon Guards, stationed outside the Deer Wilderness, couldn't help but tremble when the pressure descended upon them.</p><p>The heavenly tribulation wasn't over yet.  Multicolored clouds filled the sky, their light forming vast swathes. Then, wind and thunder intermingled, and this region of heaven and earth descended into complete chaos. Finally, they sensed a familiar fluctuation and saw formless flames flickering within the heart of the storm.</p><p>"Yin Fire Tribulation!  Master... has succeeded!"</p><p>A Nether Moon Guard uttered these words almost in a moan, his gaze towards the Deer Wilderness filled with both reverence and awe.</p><p>On the main peak of the Deer Wilderness.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely detached, allowing the Yin Fire to burn him.</p><p>The tribulation-crossing formation was active.  The two treasures at the Yin and Yang poles shone brightly, projecting ice and fire pillars respectively. The forty-nine Icefire Tokens broke free from their grooves and rose into the air, revolving around Qin Sang.</p><p>The Icefire Tokens received the power of ice and fire.  The two mutually exclusive energies, flowing through the tokens, converged into a single force, circulating around Qin Sang endlessly.</p><p>Protected by this energy, the Yin Fire dancing around Qin Sang did indeed weaken, no longer as fierce as it had been initially.</p>
