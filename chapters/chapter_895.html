<h1>Chapter 887 Nascent Soul</h1><p>While the avatar pondered, the Dao Child finished his lecture.</p><p>After answering a few of the avatar's questions, the Dao Child led him away from Jade Finger Peak.  Using a magical artifact, they crossed a great river and arrived at a fiery red stone hall atop a cliff by the riverbank.</p><p>Before they even drew close, a wave of intense heat washed over them.</p><p>This stone hall was constructed from a peculiar stone imbued with the power of fire.  Reinforced with appropriate restrictions, it could preserve this fiery power indefinitely.  Cultivating spiritual fire here was far easier, making the refining process twice as efficient.</p><p>The two landed in front of the stone hall but didn't enter directly.</p><p>The Dao Child sent a pulse of spiritual energy to activate the restriction on the hall's door.</p><p>Soon, heavy footsteps echoed from within, and a brawny man with bronze skin strode out, his gaze sweeping over them.</p><p>“Senior Brother Jin Yan!”</p><p>The Dao Child bowed respectfully.</p><p>Jin Yan's face, initially etched with irritation as if he'd been interrupted from an important task, softened slightly upon seeing the Dao Child.  He grumbled, “So it’s Junior Brother Yang! I heard you became Master Huayang's personal attendant.  Do you have time to wander around?”</p><p>The man’s booming voice resonated within the hall, his words blunt and direct.</p><p>The Dao Child, seemingly familiar with Jin Yan, didn't mind his tone and replied, “I’ve come to offer you a helping hand, Senior Brother, someone to tend your fires.”</p><p>The brawny man’s eyes shifted, finally noticing the avatar. He chuckled, “Someone you brought?  What can they possibly do besides cause trouble?  I don't recognize this kid. When did he join?”</p><p>“You’re so engrossed in refining, Senior Brother, it's no wonder you haven't met him. Zhang Yue is a new disciple.  I asked Senior Brother Lu to assign him to you.” The Dao Child gestured for the avatar to step forward. “He studied refining before joining, Senior Brother. You can test him.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The brawny man sized up the avatar, stating bluntly, “Come in and try then. I happen to have a batch of spiritual materials that need refining. Junior Brother Yang, let’s be clear. You know how much I have on my plate.  I can't help your Yin Yang lineage raise idlers. Our friendship is one thing, but if you’ve brought me a useless fellow, I won’t keep him…”</p><p>“Naturally! I wouldn't dare bother you, Senior Brother Jin Yan, with an incompetent disciple.” The Dao Child spoke with confidence. He had questioned the avatar about refining beforehand, confirming his proficiency.</p><p>With that, the brawny man opened the door, inviting them inside.</p><p>The heat within the hall was even more intense.</p><p>Following behind, the avatar entered a stone chamber and saw a large pile of purple ore.  He feigned astonishment, “So much Purple Wind Copper Ore!”</p><p>This ore could be refined into Purple Wind Copper, ideal for crafting metal-type magical artifacts.</p><p>Jin Yan raised an eyebrow. “Recognizing Purple Wind Copper Ore at a glance...seems Junior Brother Yang didn't deceive me. Choose a piece and refine the Purple Wind Copper. Show me your skills.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The avatar lowered his head, obediently entered the stone chamber, grabbed a moderately sized piece of ore, and walked to the fire channel in the center. Under Jin Yan’s guidance, he activated the restriction.</p><p>…</p><p>An hour later, the Dao Child flew out of the stone hall with a smile, his light heading straight for Yin Yang Peak.</p><p>The avatar stood at the hall's entrance, toying with the token in his hand.</p><p>With his refining expertise, a fraction of his true skill was enough to amaze them. Of course, he wouldn’t be so arrogant.  Diligently refining a piece of pure Purple Wind Copper, meeting Jin Yan's requirements, was sufficient.</p><p>Seeing the refined copper, Jin Yan didn't hesitate to keep him.</p><p>The Dao Child, relieved to have completed his task, hurried back to the mountain, reminding the avatar to focus on condensing the Yin Yang Armor and avoid disturbing him unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>“You have a foundation in refining.  Have you considered dedicating yourself to this path?”</p><p>Jin Yan’s voice came from behind, but he then shook his head.  “Forget I asked! Master Huayang brought you in.  The Yin Yang lineage wouldn’t let me waste your talent.  I don’t want to invite trouble. Come with me. I’ll introduce you to a senior brother. He'll give you some spiritual materials daily.  Complete the tasks, and you're free to do as you please. I won’t interfere.”</p><p>“Thank you, Senior Uncle Jin!”</p><p>The avatar offered a dutiful thanks.</p><p>They walked deeper into the hall, turning a corner to arrive at another stone chamber.  Jin Yan left him with a disciple named Gao Yi and departed.</p><p>“Since Master personally instructed, Junior Brother Zhang, start by refining this batch of Red Jade into round pendants.  Once you’re done, I’ll take you to choose a cave dwelling. We have quite a few vacant ones on the cliff face.”</p><p>Gao Yi led the avatar to an adjacent quiet chamber.  Inside were some crimson jade stones, a small quantity that others could finish in an hour. The avatar was even faster.</p><p>Compared to the tasks of others, his was undoubtedly easier, even Gao Yi seemed somewhat envious.</p><p>After Gao Yi left, the avatar closed the door. Despite his low cultivation, he completed the task in just half an hour.</p><p>He didn't rush to leave. The hall, though hot, was rich with spiritual energy. He sat in meditation within the chamber, deciding to attempt condensing the Yin Yang Armor here.</p><p>Condensing the Yin Yang Armor first required sensing and refining the Yin and Yang energies from the chaotic spiritual energy within the void. This wasn't difficult for the avatar. His main body, at the Core Formation stage, was extremely familiar with various refining methods.</p><p>He formed a hand seal, and the surrounding spiritual energy surged towards him.</p><p>A funnel-shaped vortex appeared above his head, spinning rapidly, faster and faster. Suddenly, an unexpected event occurred—the vortex exploded with a bang.</p><p>A streak of light shot out from the avatar's dantian, effortlessly suppressing the chaotic spiritual energy. It was the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, lending a secret hand.</p><p>The avatar smiled wryly. “This body’s cultivation is too weak. It seems I can’t rush it. I can only take it slowly…”</p><p>He adjusted his breathing and began to invoke the incantation again, this time with gentler movements.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>“Junior Brother Zhang…”</p><p>A knock came at the chamber door.  The avatar, roused from his meditative state by Gao Yi's voice, quickly stopped the incantation.</p><p>He calculated the time—two hours had passed.</p><p>The avatar opened his palm, revealing two wisps of energy, one black and one white, swirling like nimble fish.</p><p>“Two hours of cultivation, and I’ve only condensed this much.  True new disciples, without talent, wouldn’t even be able to cultivate this technique, let alone enter the sect. It truly is a profound esoteric art…”</p><p>The avatar murmured, then suddenly clenched his fist.  The Yin and Yang energies vanished into his body, guided by his will, flowing swiftly along his meridians and into his Purple Mansion.</p>
