<h1>Chapter 681: The Monster Hunting Team</h1><p>Chapter 681: The Monster Hunting Team</p><p>Qin Sang's actions were observed by Ran Luo and the others, who grew increasingly friendly towards him, gradually bridging the gap between them.  Even the chief artificer, a young man surnamed Zhuo, whose initial hostility towards Qin Sang had been minimal, let go of any remaining resentment after several exchanges of refining techniques.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang also reaped considerable rewards.  However, while making friends, he remained guarded, finding it difficult to truly trust anyone.</p><p>After speaking with the young man surnamed Zhuo, Qin Sang learned that Zhuo’s sect, the Jian Ding Sect, was indeed a renowned crafting powerhouse in the Cang Lang Sea.  Qin Sang seized an opportunity to discuss the Ten Divine Trees.</p><p>Zhuo, looking ashamed, explained that due to his limited talent, he was not valued by his sect and was forced to venture out on his own. He lacked access to core sect secrets and was unsure if any of the major crafting sects in the Cang Lang Sea possessed the Ten Divine Trees.  He hadn't heard of anyone in the Jian Ding Sect obtaining them in his over a hundred years there.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that in the past six months, Ran Luo had procured four live dragons for him.  After absorbing their dragon spirits, Qin Sang now had six in the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman.  Master Xuan Yu had expended immense effort to gather that many years ago.</p><p>Qin Sang went to the uninhabited waters near Du Yan Island to try activating the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman in conjunction with sword energy and thunder.  His escape techniques had become significantly faster than the average mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.  His ability to flee from danger was greatly enhanced.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang stayed on Du Yan Island for several months, finally nearing the completion of his task.  Since Ran Luo had been unable to procure any more live dragons, Qin Sang decided to go out to sea himself to hunt for dragon spirits.  Gathering ten dragon spirits would trigger a qualitative change in the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman!</p><p>When Qin Sang sought out Ran Luo, she didn't object and, as requested, helped him find a reliable team.</p><p>"Daoist, according to information from the Commerce Guild, the southern edge of the trench sometimes sees dragons.  However, besides Spirit Transformation stage dragons, traces of Core Formation stage dragons have been found in the depths.  Dragons are among the most powerful of the demons; they’re difficult to handle. Perhaps we should wait a while longer.  When Hui Wen returns, she can help you," Ran Luo advised.</p><p>Ran Luo was uneasy about the team Qin Sang requested—it consisted of only five False Core stage cultivators, with Qin Sang, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, as the only leader.</p><p>Qin Sang’s reasoning was that working with similarly powerful cultivators would lead to disputes over spoils and difficulties in control.  Those cultivators wouldn't readily obey someone of the same realm.  This weaker team, while less powerful, would allow him greater control as long as he avoided provoking powerful late-stage Core Formation demons.  He was confident in his ability to escape.</p><p>Hui Wen had only recently left Du Yan Island and would be gone for some time.  The Commerce Guild didn’t have many Foundation Establishment cultivators stationed on the island, and they were all busy.</p><p>“No need to trouble Daoist Hui Wen. I’ll only target peak Spirit Transformation stage dragons this time. I’ll return immediately after gathering the dragon spirits; there won't be any danger,” Qin Sang refused.</p><p>Ran Luo, unable to persuade him further, instructed someone to bring the monster hunting team and introduced their background to Qin Sang.</p><p>“The team has five members, recruited into the Guild six months ago by Manager Ning before he left. While their cultivation is not high, they have been active on Du Yan Island for many years and enjoy a good reputation.  Most importantly, they’ve spent a considerable amount of time in the southern trench and are extremely knowledgeable about the local demons, possessing unique skills in both monster hunting and early warning.  Of course, I've instructed them to follow your lead entirely once at sea…”</p><p>Ran Luo introduced the team members to Qin Sang.</p><p>All five were False Core cultivators, drawn to the Demon Sea in pursuit of Core Formation. They had met on Du Yan Island and forged a bond of trust.</p><p>Qin Sang noted their information. He primarily chose them for their familiarity with dragon habitats, relying on them for guidance and assistance in locating the dragons.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang met the five.</p><p>“Junior respectfully greets Daoist Qingfeng,” the five bowed together.</p><p>Qin Sang sat, observing them.</p><p>Three women and two men; two of the younger women bore a striking resemblance and were sisters. They reminded him of the Le sisters from Little Cold Region.  It was rare for two sisters to reach such high cultivation levels, especially as independent cultivators.  The older woman and the man in green robes were a couple.</p><p>This elderly couple, well over two hundred years old, showed the unmistakable signs of age and fatigue on their faces.  At their age, achieving the coveted Golden Core stage of cultivation was virtually impossible.</p><p>Ran Luo explained that they had been in the Canglang Sea for decades, fortunate to have escaped life-threatening situations, but sadly, neither had managed to form a Golden Core. They had one son, currently cultivating in the Inner Sea.  They had given up on achieving the Golden Core themselves, dedicating their remaining time to accumulating cultivation resources for their son.</p><p>The fifth person was a middle-aged man in grey robes, a sword cultivator.</p><p>These five individuals appeared unremarkable, but Qin Sang sensed a subtle aura of lethality about them. Even their bows and stances were meticulously calculated, maintaining constant contact with each other.  This was the unmistakable mark of seasoned cultivators who had seen extensive combat.  Having spent several years in the chaotic waters of the islands, witnessing countless battles, Qin Sang recognized this immediately.  Working together, these five could easily defeat an unsuspecting early Golden Core cultivator who underestimated them.</p><p>“There’s no need for ceremony,” Qin Sang said, standing and surveying them, his tone turning serious. “After we leave the island, I will require your assistance. If you have any suggestions, feel free to voice them; if they are reasonable, I will certainly comply. However,” he continued, his voice hardening, “if anyone acts without my permission, or disobeys my orders, I will not hesitate to take their life!”</p><p>As the words left his lips, a wave of killing intent erupted from Qin Sang, a potent mixture of cultivated power and years of experience, startling even Ran Luo.  The five were visibly shaken, hastily assuring him of their obedience.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, satisfied. “Time is of the essence. Return now and prepare; we set out tomorrow.”</p><p>The next morning, six figures silently departed from Duyan Island. They initially headed west, but after a short distance, they circled several times before finally setting a course for the southeast.  Qin Sang allowed the elderly couple to lead the way, his spectral cloud following closely behind.</p><p>Their caution impressed Qin Sang.  Surviving decades in the demon sea certainly required skill. To accommodate them, he slowed his pace, covertly observing the environment. In such a treacherous place, they were constantly at risk of ambush by demonic beasts; even flight altitude was critical.  The couple answered all his questions, giving him valuable insight.</p>
