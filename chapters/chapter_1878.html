Chapter 1869: The Great Sage


A crimson star descended from the heavens.
Blazing winds rolled forth, warping the very void.
With a chanted command, the old Daoist abruptly flicked his dust whisk. The whisk, like a sword, slanted towards the sky.
The golden light within the battle formation, stirred by the dust whisk, surged into a golden wave.
‘Crack!’
The threads of the dust whisk exploded outwards, yet remained strangely ordered. Thousands of silver strands formed an incredibly complex rune, as golden light madly converged towards the tip of the whisk.
Before the dust whisk, the golden light coalesced into a golden spirit talisman. The talisman paper, brilliantly gold, was thin as a cicada's wing, and flowed like water.
Nearly thirty feet long, the spirit talisman resembled a golden banner planted in the void. The banner bore no words, but was covered in golden runes, far more intricate than any the old Daoist had used before.
As golden light flowed, the golden talisman floated upwards, seemingly slow yet incredibly fast, meeting the incoming meteorite. In a flash, it appeared before the celestial rock.
The meteorite was enormous, its surrounding flames forming an even larger fireball. Compared to it, the golden talisman seemed minuscule, insignificant.
But the instant the meteorite touched the golden talisman, its momentum halted, its speed plummeting.
Time seemed to freeze as the fireball collided with an unyielding barrier, its leading edge deeply indented.
The golden talisman pierced the fireball. Though seemingly fragile, it forced the crimson flames to recoil.
Amidst the chaotic inferno, the golden talisman's light shone brilliantly, piercing through layers of raging fire until it finally penetrated the fireball and imprinted itself upon the meteorite within.
‘Boom!’
The meteorite shuddered violently.
‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’
Streams of crimson fire, losing control, erupted from the fireball and shot in all directions.
The golden talisman adhered to the meteorite's surface. Though seemingly a small inscription, falling lightly, it possessed the might of a thousand jun, causing the massive meteorite to tremble ceaselessly, suspended in mid-air.
Immediately, the golden talisman erupted with even more intense golden light. The light, sharp as a blade, churned the fiery storm and pierced the meteorite's core.
‘Crack! Crack!’
The meteorite vibrated wildly, fissures appearing where the golden talisman struck. Intersecting at the center of the talisman, these cracks formed larger crevices, spreading outwards in all directions.
Ravines and craters marred the meteorite's surface.
In the next instant, the opposite side of the meteorite was also torn apart, golden light seeping through.
In the blink of an eye, the meteorite, pierced by the power of the golden talisman, was filled with golden light, inside and out.
‘Boom!’
A thunderous roar shook the battlefield.
Crimson-gold light exploded, blindingly bright. Fragments of the meteorite, trailing flames, shot outwards like fireworks. The sight was breathtaking, yet a terrifying shockwave spread in its wake.
The meteorite had been torn apart by a single golden talisman!
All who witnessed it were awestruck. The demon cultivators were horrified, while the human cultivators rejoiced.
The two Demon King Dharma Bodies groaned, retreating several zhang, their forms dishevelled, their auras in disarray.
The meteorite had been summoned from the outer realms by their Dharma Bodies, their energies intertwined. With the meteorite's destruction, they inevitably suffered backlash.
The Earth Armored Dragon anxiously thrashed its long tail, while the Fire Essence glared intently at the fragmented painting of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons.
Damaged and incomplete, this treasure was far from the legendary Heavenly Prisons. The Ghost Soldiers and Talisman Deities were limited in power.  In past battles, with Grand Masters and Demon Kings ever-present, the Yintian Palace hadn't seemed so formidable. Only after their cultivation was suppressed did they truly grasp the treasure's power.
With the meteorite shattered and the Demon Kings reeling, the Daoist side's morale surged. The old Daoist, having unleashed the golden talisman, pointed his dust whisk forward.
The three Grand Masters, piloting their platforms, had already overtaken the old Daoist.  The other Masters and troops shifted their formation, dividing into three forces, each led by a Grand Master, and launched their assault on the enemy.
The old Daoist remained the core of the battle formation, directing hand seals, pacing techniques, talismans, and summoning deities and generals…
His mastery was profound. Relying on the fragmented painting, he unleashed a dazzling array of divine abilities.
Three spearheads now protruded from the front of the golden battle formation, like three golden arrowheads, advancing in unison. Led by the three Grand Masters, they charged towards the enemy ranks, their offensive like a tide, unstoppable!
On the other hand, the Gui Fang Kingdom side, their morale crushed by the meteorite's destruction, seemed stunned by the power of the fragmented painting of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons. The Demon Kings hesitated, failing to mount an effective response, leading to widespread panic and disarray in their ranks.
A Demon King Dharma Body, with the form of a scorpion-tailed lion, even retreated. As it did, a green fog rushed towards it.
The green fog, highly toxic, was the scorpion-tailed lion's own divine ability.
During the earlier fighting, it had secretly released the poison.  Unexpectedly, before it could take effect, the old Daoist's dust whisk had sent it back.
Facing its own poisonous fog, the scorpion-tailed lion dared not confront it directly, for it was now infused with the power of the Talisman Deities.
‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’
The scorpion tail lashed out, unleashing beams of divine light to disperse the poisonous fog.
Similar scenarios unfolded throughout the demon ranks.
With one side gaining momentum and the other falling into chaos, the Daoist forces, their morale soaring, were poised to break through the enemy lines and charge into the auspicious clouds.
Finally, the White-Robed Demon King reacted.  He seemed to have only just noticed the changing tide of battle behind him, slowly turning around.
As the battlefield came into view, the White-Robed Demon King's expression remained unchanged, his gaze indifferent.
Casually glancing at the old Daoist and the others, the White-Robed Demon King tilted his head slightly, murmuring as if in reminiscence, "The Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons…"
Instead of panic, a strange, unreadable expression appeared on the White-Robed Demon King's face.
The Masters felt a pang of unease, unable to pinpoint the source of their apprehension.
The demon army's spirit had been broken, and it was too late for them to regroup. The Demon Kings' reactions seemed genuine, with no hint of a trap.
There were no unusual fluctuations from the White-Robed Demon King either.
All signs pointed to their impending victory, yet their unease intensified.
Suddenly, a mocking sneer appeared on the White-Robed Demon King's lips. He raised a hand and beckoned behind him.
The tremors within the auspicious clouds abruptly ceased.
The swirling vortex of auspicious clouds stopped rotating, the multicolored qi within dissipating. A streak of light flew from the vortex into the White-Robed Demon King's hand - the half of the Imperial Decree.
The passage to the Divine Court had vanished.
The White-Robed Demon King, holding the Imperial Decree, swept his gaze coldly across the battlefield and clenched his fist.
‘Crack!’
The Imperial Decree shattered.
The sound of the shattering, though not loud, boomed like thunder in the Masters' ears, causing their hearts to skip a beat.
The old Daoist hurriedly looked at the other half of the Imperial Decree floating beside him and found it covered in cracks.
At the same time, four streaks of light shot out from the demon ranks, including the Earth Armored Dragon and two other Demon King Dharma Bodies.
Between the three Dharma Bodies was an unremarkable young man, possessing only the cultivation of a Demon Marquis, yet protected by the three Demon Kings.
The young man, his face tense, flew to the White-Robed Demon King's side. He took a gray cloth pouch from his bosom, and upon releasing its seal, a beam of purple light flew out, landing before the White-Robed Demon King.
"This humble Marquis has fulfilled his mission," the young man breathed a sigh of relief, bowing and retreating, his expression filled with excitement.
The purple light coalesced into a purple drum. It had no drumsticks, but its waist was wrapped in golden threads, outlining various strange beast forms.
“Roar!”
A tiger's roar suddenly echoed.
For the first time, the White-Robed Demon King manifested his Dharma Body – a ferocious white tiger – which then merged into his body.
He raised his right hand, a purple mark appearing in his palm. Purple light surged towards his palm, transforming into a purple drumstick.
Purple lightning danced across the surface of the drumstick, radiating a divine aura.
After forming this drumstick, the White-Robed Demon King's face became deathly pale, clearly exhausted.
"The Demon Calling Drum!"
Seeing the purple drum, the old Daoist's face completely changed.
The three Grand Masters and some of the more knowledgeable Masters also paled, crying out in alarm.
The Demon Calling Drum was the Gui Fang Kingdom's ultimate treasure, bar none.
Even True Treasures and Acquired Spirit Treasures paled in comparison to this treasure in the eyes of the Gui Fang Kingdom's demon cultivators.
The Gui Fang Kingdom's very existence was largely due to this drum.
None of the Masters present had witnessed the Demon Calling Drum's power firsthand, but they had all heard the legends.
It was said that once the spiritual drum was struck, its sound would instantly travel for thousands of miles.
Reaching the depths of the Wastelands, the ferocious beasts and ghostly beings within would be driven mad, drawn by the drum's call.
It was rumored that the drum's sound could attract ferocious beasts and ghostly beings as powerful as Great Sages, or even more terrifying entities!
The Wastelands, the Waste Sea, boundless and limitless, were even more perilous than imagined.
These ferocious beasts and ghostly beings instinctively loathed the fluctuations of the Capital Seal. The stronger they were, the more sensitive they were to it. Unless provoked, they would not actively approach.
But once driven mad by the drum's sound and driven into the Four Regions, the consequences would be unimaginable.
Fortunately, the Gui Fang Kingdom could not fully control these ferocious beasts and ghostly beings.
Even a Great Sage personally directing them risked being devoured. Before they could annihilate their enemies, they might find their own kingdom trampled by the beasts, a pyrrhic victory. Thus, they dared not lightly strike the spiritual drum.
However, when the Gui Fang Kingdom faced its demise, it would undoubtedly unleash the beasts without hesitation, destroying the Four Regions and perishing alongside the Daoist sects.
With the Demon Calling Drum as a deterrent, the Daoist sects dared not push the Gui Fang Kingdom to this point.
Because of this, the Daoist sects of this realm, holding two of the Four Regions, had been stronger than the Gui Fang Kingdom for many years. Yet even at their peak, they had never managed to annihilate the Gui Fang Kingdom.
The Demon Calling Drum was truly a national treasure, always kept within the Great Sage's Palace, heavily guarded.
If this treasure were ever lost, the fate of the Gui Fang Kingdom would be in the hands of the Daoist sects.
And now, they dared to bring the Demon Calling Drum into the Wastelands!
The White-Robed Demon King's face was contorted in a grimace as he raised the drumstick high with both hands and brought it down with all his might.
‘Dong!’
The drumstick in the White-Robed Demon King's hand vanished, as if all its power had been spent.  His face dripped with sweat, his whole body trembling, his weakness evident.
Intense purple light erupted from the drum's surface, stinging the Masters' eyes.
The drum's sound echoed far and wide.
It reached the battlefield, piercing through layers of illusions, reaching the ears of Qin Sang, Master Zuo, and the others within the Region Platform.
The Grand Masters and Demon Kings outside the Region Platform also heard the drumbeat.
These events occurred almost simultaneously. The drum's sound continued to spread throughout the Wastelands, traveling thousands of miles in an instant, reaching its deepest recesses.
‘Dong!’
Another Demon King took the White-Robed Demon King's place, striking the drum a second time, then a third Demon King stepped forward…
…
A towering mountain range.
The mountains seemed forged from black iron, their dark stone surfaces devoid of vegetation or any sign of ferocious beasts.
The terrain was treacherous, soaring into the clouds. Approaching these mountains brought a sense of infinite oppression.
The pressure instilled a primal fear, keeping all beasts at bay.
Atop the highest peak was a vast plateau with a depression in its center.
Suddenly, a sharp shriek, filled with boundless rage, echoed from within the mountain. The surrounding area erupted into chaos as countless beasts fled in terror.
“Screech!”
The shriek pierced the heavens, drowning out the drumbeat.
In the next instant, a massive shadow enveloped the entire mountain range. In the sky above, only a pair of black wings could be seen, blotting out the sun like a descending cloud.
…
Meanwhile, in another part of the Wastelands' depths, on a vast, boundless plain.
When the drumbeat reached this place, an earth-shattering explosion ripped through the plain's center.
Waves of earth surged tens of thousands of feet into the air, leaving a bottomless pit in the plain.
A roar like thunder shook the heavens and earth.
The beast itself remained unseen, but a gray lightning bolt shot out from the pit, tearing through the void.
Where the lightning passed, it left behind jagged bolts of electricity in the void. Countless lightning bolts filled the sky, using the heavens as a canvas, sketching a divine image of thunder, as if tearing the sky asunder.
Occasionally, an arc of lightning would strike the ground, easily obliterating a mountain and annihilating all life within.
…
The shriek and the roar shook the Wastelands. The armies outside the Region Platform heard them as well.
The cultivators all looked towards the depths of the Wastelands.  The auspicious clouds within the Region Platform seemed to grow even more vibrant, like a rainbow.
Behind the auspicious clouds lay the deep sky, where beings that terrified them resided.
Even Grand Masters and Demon Kings trembled at the sounds, seemingly sensing the approaching aura of terrifying ferocity, filled with dread.
…
Inside the Region Platform.
Qin Sang was still bewildered, unaware of the Demon Calling Drum or the significance of its sound.
Master Zuo clearly had no time to explain.
However, seeing Master Zuo's expression, Qin Sang understood that something disastrous for the Daoist sects had occurred.
Three drumbeats had sounded, and Qin Sang suddenly furrowed his brow, faintly hearing the shriek and the roar.
The sounds came from outside the Region Platform, not distinct, yet they sent shivers down his spine, as if something terrifyingly powerful was approaching.
Master Zuo abruptly raised his head, his expression even more furious and alarmed, confirming Qin Sang's fears.
…
In the depths of the Region Platform.
The Daoist forces fought fiercely, but they were too late to stop the Demon Kings from sounding the Demon Calling Drum.
The white-robed scholar, though weakened, continued to gaze longingly at the fragmented painting of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons.
At this moment, the more astute Masters began to understand.
There was no Divine Court emergence!
It was all a lie, a trap laid by the Gui Fang Kingdom. They had exploited the unusual unrest within the Region Platform, meticulously planning for a hundred years, leading the Daoist sects step by step into this trap, all for this day!
So, what was the Gui Fang Kingdom's goal?
The old Daoist abruptly looked up.
The fragmented painting of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons!
The Gui Fang Kingdom wanted to seize the fragmented painting of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons!
In ancient times, the Earthly Mother Celestial Master had founded the Divine Path and refined the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons. This treasure was the origin of the Divine Path.
If the Gui Fang Kingdom truly intended to revive the Divine Path, the fragmented painting, as a reference, would be invaluable.
However, this treasure had always been kept within Crane Cry Mountain, protected by the Yintian Palace's grand formation, with reinforcements readily available from the Daoist Court. It wasn't easily stolen.
Once the fragmented painting left the Yintian Palace, especially if brought into the Wastelands, it would be much easier to seize. Sounding the Demon Calling Drum here also lessened their concerns.
The old Daoist instantly grasped the truth, his hand gripping the dust whisk trembling as he desperately tried to retrieve the fragmented painting.
…
At the border between the Wastelands and Mount Gang Region.
As the Imperial Decree was crushed, the heavens roiled.
Dark clouds gathered, blotting out the sun, rapidly spreading towards the Region Platform of Mount Ju Region, swiftly crossing the vast Wastelands, golden light faintly shimmering within the clouds like scales.
The armies outside the Region Platform were suddenly plunged into darkness. Looking up, they saw dark clouds covering the eastern sky, accompanied by wind and thunder, rumbling towards them.
