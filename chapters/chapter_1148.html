<h1>Chapter 1140: The Yao King's Birthday</h1><p>The willow spirit saw Qin Sang's hesitation and whispered, “Those three treasure vaults may all contain treasures, or they may only be in one of them.  If Young Master Qin wishes to steal the treasures, there's a good opportunity soon. You could take advantage of the occasion of the Qienji Yao King's birthday celebration.”</p><p>“The Yao King is holding a birthday banquet?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, then realized he had again made a mistake in his assumptions.</p><p>Great demons who have gained sentience, whether awakened by Emperor's Dew or through self-transformation, are no less intelligent than humans; holding a birthday banquet isn't strange at all.</p><p>After entering the Sky Demon Ridge, Qin Sang discovered that those demonic beasts were even more concerned with etiquette than humans, seemingly afraid of being ridiculed for their uncouth nature despite attaining enlightenment.</p><p>“When beasts and spirits are unenlightened, they don’t know when they were born.  We plant spirits are even less aware. Therefore, most demons consider the day they suddenly awakened and learned to cultivate the essence of heaven and earth as their birthday.”</p><p>The willow spirit explained briefly, then continued, “After the Qienji Yao King transformed, he holds a birthday banquet every sixty years. At that time, the Qienji Yao King will leave his cave, and other Yao Kings acquainted with him will send junior demons to offer gifts.  This is the most chaotic time in the Wan Snake Abyss—perhaps you could steal the treasures amidst the confusion. The next banquet is next year…”</p><p>Qin Sang did some mental calculations.</p><p>It was already late autumn; the Qienji Yao King's birthday banquet was only a few months away.</p><p>The willow spirit’s suggestion was promising, but they knew nothing about the Yao King's treasure vaults. Qin Sang wasn't sure he could open them all without alarming the Qienji Yao King.</p><p>“Young Master Qin, the old monkey and I still have some strength. We can infiltrate with you.”</p><p>said the willow spirit.</p><p>“No! You must stay outside; you absolutely cannot appear before the Qienji Yao King!”</p><p>Qin Sang refused without hesitation.</p><p>His daring to covet the Yao King's treasures stemmed from his mastery of several powerful techniques and his comprehension of some of the power of the Corpse Soul Pearl; his strength far surpassed that of an ordinary Golden Core peak cultivator.</p><p>If he failed, he still had a good chance of escaping.</p><p>The willow spirit and the old monkey did not possess such abilities. If exposed, they would be killed, and it would implicate the Qianshan Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Hearing this, a strange look flashed in the willow spirit's eyes, and it silently nodded.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a while and said, “Please continue to investigate information about the Qienji Yao King's birthday banquet, whether other Yao Kings will come to celebrate in person.  Also, before taking the risk, I must first secure the fastest escape route from the Wan Snake Abyss.”</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>The willow spirit left to carry out its task.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, then returned to the cave, woke Bai, and told him his plan.</p><p>“Though your escape techniques are strong, at best you can only match the Yao King, but you lack the Three Lights Jade Liquid, and your true essence is far inferior to the Yao King's. Simply fleeing won't do.”</p><p>Bai reminded Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang understood that he was still no match for a transformed great demon. Fortunately, he had already devised a countermeasure.</p><p>“I’ve purchased Mist Enveloping Pills and a set of trapping arrays. This array is even more valuable than the pills, and you'll personally oversee its deployment along my escape route. Even a Yao King, once caught, will find it difficult to break instantly. Then we can calmly choose to flee or use the Twelve Demon Banner Array to ambush…”</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang had a plan, Bai had no objections and agreed to help him steal the treasures.</p><p>After Li Hong Yao King left.</p><p>The Qianshan Bamboo Sea returned to calm.</p><p>Qin Sang cultivated in his cave, continuing to refine his sword array.</p><p>Unknowingly, another half a year passed.</p><p>…</p><p>Wan Snake Abyss.</p><p>Located south of the Yun Cang River, near the edge of the desert.</p><p>Countless abysses here, like a fishing net, extend in all directions, the longest stretching tens of thousands of miles, penetrating the desert.</p><p>Wan Snake Abyss is just a part of this system of abysses; after being occupied by the Qienji Yao King, the surrounding area became his territory, and he named it Wan Snake Abyss.</p><p>Outside the abyss, mountains stand tall, verdant and lush.</p><p>The valley…</p><p>It was midsummer, the heat was unbearable, yet the Wan Snake Abyss remained chilling.</p><p>On this day, sand and stones flew, and many junior demons rode demonic fog and winds, entering the abyss in groups.</p><p>Within the Wan Snake Abyss, a celebratory atmosphere prevailed.</p><p>Even the uncivilized small demons could feel the joy, dancing and leaping.</p><p>The Qienji Yao King's cave was in the deepest part of the Wan Snake Abyss, and the birthday banquet was held in the most beautiful place—by the Dark Lake.</p><p>By nightfall, the place was brightly lit, adorned with night pearls the size of a human head.</p><p>Beautiful women, like flitting butterflies, smiled as they moved among strangely shaped demonic beasts, carrying trays of food, seemingly unafraid.</p><p>Golden tables and jade stands overflowed with exquisite food and drink, their fragrant aromas filling the air.  Human women played music on stage, accompanied by dancing snakes.</p><p>These snakes, though serpentine, wore floral crowns; their scales shimmered in shades of pink and purple. Their vertical pupils, far from cold, seemed to convey endless affection, their movements incredibly seductive, even their occasional flicking tongues adding to their allure.</p><p>Far from being terrifying, they captivated the lesser demons more than the human women. The smaller demons roared with excitement and lust.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling…</p><p>The Demon King Qianji heard the commotion outside and laughed heartily. He said to the stunning half-human, half-snake demoness beside him,  "My Lady, the auspicious hour approaches.  If we don't appear soon, our underlings will be impatient."</p><p>"What's the rush? If they're impatient, let your favorite concubine go out."</p><p>The snake demoness, who was applying makeup, gave him a side-eye.  Though half-human, half-snake, she, like the snake queen's spirit beast, hadn't broken through to the transformation stage, only reaching the mid-stage of the demon core.</p><p>"Hey! She's merely a plaything. How can she compare to my Lady?  It's my birthday; my Lady's presence is essential for the celebration!"</p><p>Qianji thumped his chest, speaking with righteous indignation. "I just received a batch of excellent spirit wine, but unfortunately, my father-in-law is tied up with matters and can't join me for a drink."</p><p>"Nonsense!  A father-in-law doesn't personally celebrate his son-in-law's birthday!"</p><p>The snake demoness glared at him.</p><p>Qianji laughed, "My fault! My fault! I'll personally deliver the wine to my father-in-law another day."</p><p>The snake demoness leaned slightly against the Demon King, smiling alluringly. Gently raising her arm, she murmured sweetly, "My husband, won't you help me up?"</p><p>"At once, my Lady—"</p><p>…</p><p>The appearance of Demon King Qianji and his wife caused an uproar of cheers.  The auspicious hour arrived. The banquet began.</p><p>Qianji and his wife sat in high seats.  Subordinates sent by other demon kings presented gifts.  Qianji's own demons offered their tributes, wishing the King long life and prosperity.</p><p>Celestial music filled the Wan Snake Abyss, a stark contrast to the desolate wasteland outside, creating an illusion of a paradise.</p><p>However, unbeknownst to them, a figure was already lurking in the shadows, stealthily approaching the Demon King's cave.</p><p>"Fortunately, no other demon kings have appeared yet.  The defenses here are considerably weaker than usual, and everyone is distracted by the feast…"</p><p>Qin Sang remained hidden in the shadows, carefully observing what lay ahead.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>These two chapters make up for yesterday's and the previous ones.  More to come.</p>
