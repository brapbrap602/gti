<h1>Chapter 1385: Despair and Resolution</h1><p>Chapter 1385: Despair and Resolution</p><p>“The rat demon isn’t dead!”</p><p>Island Master Shen exclaimed.</p><p>Master Feng, flying at the forefront, frowned upon hearing this.</p><p>He and Island Master Shen had personally laid an ambush to kill the rat demon, witnessing its demise with their own eyes—yet they had failed!</p><p>Could it be that they hadn't killed the rat demon's true form, but only an avatar?</p><p>The situation didn't allow Master Feng time to ponder.</p><p>The mark had lost its connection, but the direction was clear.</p><p>His figure moved like smoke, his escape technique seamless.  After flying a short distance, he suddenly saw a dark shadow appear on the sea ahead—clearly an island.</p><p>The island was pitch-black, deserted, a desolate isle.</p><p>Master Feng's heart leaped.</p><p>The appearance of this island was no accident; the Xuan Tian Palace traitor was likely hiding here!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Master Feng flew to the edge of the island and without hesitation unleashed his spiritual sense, searching the island thoroughly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he found nothing unusual.</p><p>…</p><p>Secret Cave.</p><p>As numerous Yuan Ying cultivators and demon kings converged and appeared near the island,</p><p>the ice-encased man in white sensed something amiss, his eyelids fluttering slightly.</p><p>“They’re quick…”</p><p>A soft sigh echoed in the quiet cave.</p><p>However, the man in white showed no signs of panic.</p><p>寒气 coalesced above the ice, forming a circular ice mirror, reflecting the scene near the island.</p><p>In an instant, the calmness in the man in white's eyes vanished, replaced by a grim expression!</p><p>“How many are there?!”</p><p>If he weren't frozen, the man in white would probably have jumped up in shock.</p><p>His plan had given him a sixty to seventy percent chance of escape, of shaking off the Rainbow Rat's pursuit.</p><p>The man in white never imagined that so much had changed during his confinement in ice.  Now, six or more demon kings were drawn here, along with a host of human Yuan Ying cultivators joining the fray.</p><p>Even at his peak, with so many people targeting him, escape would be impossible.</p><p>Despair!</p><p>Filled his heart.</p><p>The man in white’s face was bitter.</p><p>If given another chance, he would never have betrayed Xuan Tian Palace, but now regret was too late.</p><p>Suddenly, the ice mirror showed the Rainbow Rat on the back of the hawk demon.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat, having resurrected using a clone, its secret technique incomplete, was already weak and significantly weakened; sensing the mark had further depleted its strength.</p><p>Eyes fixed on the Rainbow Rat,</p><p>a cold light flashed in the man in white’s eyes, followed by a resolute expression.  He lightly vibrated his arms.</p><p>‘Crack… crack…’</p><p>The ice emitted a series of crisp sounds.</p><p>Cracks gradually spread across the entire ice block.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang and Bi Fang's battlefield.</p><p>Demonic fire and blood flames clashed, a raging inferno engulfing the heavens.</p><p>The battle had reached a fever pitch.</p><p>Bi Fang's demonic eyes flashed with fierce light, seeming to pierce through the flames and land on Qin Sang.</p><p>The power of the demonic fire was unlike anything it had ever seen.</p><p>When did the human race produce such a master?</p><p>Under the onslaught of the demonic fire, the blood flames were forced to contract. If this continued, they would soon show signs of defeat, completely suppressed by the demonic fire.</p><p>However, Bi Fang had not displayed its full power.</p><p>It was saving its trump card to defend against Qin Sang's Yuan Ying puppet.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after such a long battle, Qin Sang showed no sign of releasing the puppet.  On the plus side, the puppet might have been too badly injured to repair and thus unusable in combat.</p><p>Bi Fang’s eyes darted, a plan forming in its mind.</p><p>The others had already flown far away, it couldn't delay any longer.</p><p>The blood flames danced wildly, quickly converging in the center, then counterattacking the demonic fire.</p><p>Qin Sang, behind the demonic fire, manipulating the demon banner, remained calm. Seeing this, he felt a slight movement in his heart; it seemed he could force another technique out of Bi Fang.</p><p>This thought had only just crossed his mind.</p><p>Suddenly, with a loud roar, the pillar of blood flame shot towards the sky.</p><p>The pillar was incredibly thick, transforming into a cloud of fire in mid-air.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to act, he saw that fire cloud shift and change, forming a real Bi Fang divine bird, standing on one leg, its divine might overwhelming, surveying all directions!</p><p>He quickly looked towards the center of the sea of fire.</p><p>Bi Fang's true form had disappeared, merging with the blood flames, becoming this blood flame Bi Fang!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The blood flame Bi Fang turned its neck, its blood flame eyes fixing on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a tightening in his entire body, as if targeted by a peerless beast, feeling his mouth go dry, he became secretly vigilant and cautious.</p><p>Then, a cold snort exploded in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The blood flame Bi Fang withdrew its gaze, looking towards the direction Master Feng and the others had fled, its wings folded, suddenly shooting out a stream of fire, its body following closely behind.</p><p>Demonic fire rose, stretching across the sky, trying to stop Bi Fang.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Bi Fang's power had greatly increased, forcibly breaking through the demonic fire's blockade and escaping into the distance.</p><p>Crimson flames rained down, a scene of tragic beauty.</p><p>The demonic flames, instead of pursuing Bi Fang, converged towards the center, transforming into a fiery dragon before returning to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang, standing in mid-air, watched the direction Bi Fang flew off to, hesitated slightly, then retracted the demonic flames and gave chase.</p><p>He didn't want to force Bi Fang into a desperate battle, so he hadn't used his full power. Seeing the right moment, he ceased his relentless pursuit, letting Bi Fang go.</p><p>Having held Bi Fang back for so long, the Feng Shangshi couldn't fault him.</p><p>Besides, Qin Sang was very curious about what treasure lay ahead, one that held such a strong attraction for the experts of both races.</p><p>From the Feng Shangshi's actions, Qin Sang deduced that they certainly knew something.</p><p>He just wasn't sure if the Feng Shangshi had only just discovered the妖族's intentions, or had known all along but deliberately concealed it, fearing Qin Sang would harbor evil thoughts.</p><p>Their deal was for Qin Sang to engage Bi Fang during the upcoming battle.</p><p>The Feng Shangshi's omission of key information wasn't exactly a broken promise.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang saw no reason not to get a share of the spoils.</p><p>And Qin Sang possessed the strength to do so!</p><p>Qin Sang knew that if he showed any intention of vying for the treasure, not only the various妖 Kings, but also the Feng Shangshi and others would instantly turn against him.</p><p>So, Qin Sang decided to remain inconspicuous and observe for a while.</p><p>He still had plans for the Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>He didn't want to become enemies with the Feng Shangshi unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Unless it was a treasure vital to his cultivation, Qin Sang wouldn't act rashly. This was a good chance to make another deal with the Feng Shangshi.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Qin Sang's speed didn't falter.</p><p>He sensed the current location of his Yuan Ying talisman puppet. During his fight with Bi Fang, the puppet had gradually caught up and was trailing behind.</p><p>He had left the puppet behind as a precaution against the Feng Shangshi and others, a means of outside rescue should he fall into a trap.</p><p>Now it seemed that precaution was unnecessary.</p><p>However, he didn't have time to retrieve it.</p><p>Leaving it outside wasn't a problem; in case of an emergency, the Yuan Ying talisman puppet could still provide support.</p><p>The path ahead was unknown.</p><p>The situation was sure to be extremely chaotic.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bi Fang's escape techniques were among the best among the strong cultivators. Despite the delay caused by their fight, it wasn't long before they saw the other cultivators' streaks of escaping light.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to harass Bi Fang, making occasional attacks.</p><p>In truth, most of his attention was on the others ahead.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang saw the outline of the island, and witnessed everyone rushing towards it.</p><p>They had arrived!</p>
