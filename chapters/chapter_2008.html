<h1>Chapter 1999: A Visit</h1><p>Circulating the sixth level of the *Celestial Demon Refining Form* cultivation technique, Qin Sang felt himself transform.  In a trance, he soared through the night sky as a Star鸞, his body merging with the constellations.  Blending into the starry expanse, drawing upon the power of Stellar Essence became effortless, like a fish returning to water.  He swam through the star sea, a profound sense of ease washing over him.  Moreover, Qin Sang sensed within the depths of the night sky an incredibly pure and rich Stellar Essence.</p><p>Cultivators who tread the path of the stars typically can only absorb Stellar Essence from the scattered starlight raining down from the heavens.  Before reaching a certain realm, they cannot touch the deep void.</p><p>One of the reasons for the *Celestial Demon Refining Form*'s power lies in its ability to help cultivators reach deeper into the starry sky, accelerating the absorption and refinement of Stellar Essence.</p><p>However, before his breakthrough, Qin Sang could only vaguely perceive this pure Stellar Essence. Now, he could draw upon it.</p><p>Using this denser and purer Stellar Essence for body refinement could multiply the effects several, even tenfold. Naturally, this also placed higher demands on the cultivator.</p><p>Having stepped into the sixth level of the *Celestial Demon Refining Form*, Qin Sang naturally met the requirements. He immediately drew upon the Stellar Essence, experiencing the effects of cultivation.</p><p>All signs indicated that the higher the realm in this cultivation technique, the more emphasis was placed on the Dharma Idol, and now was no exception.</p><p>The Azure鸞 Dharma Idol descended behind Qin Sang, merging with his back as they both underwent Stellar Essence refinement.  Most of the Stellar Essence, however, was absorbed by the Azure鸞 Dharma Idol.</p><p>The benefits to Qin Sang's main body were limited unless he merged his own vital essence and blood with the Dharma Idol to undergo refinement together.</p><p>After cultivating for a while, Qin Sang sensed a change in the Azure鸞 Dharma Idol, discovering that it had grown slightly stronger.</p><p>This meant that his method of cultivation was feasible, enabling him to continue strengthening the Azure鸞 Dharma Idol and increasing his power without stagnation.</p><p>Discovering this, Qin Sang felt a sense of relief.  Since that was the case, he would maintain the status quo and not rush to make a decision.</p><p>After the divergence between his own path and the Great Vehicle Path of Slaughter in the *Violet Microcosmic Sword Scripture*, Qin Sang considered switching to other cultivation techniques.</p><p>Even in the vast world, there were likely few cultivation techniques comparable to the *Violet Microcosmic Sword Scripture*. The *Celestial Demon Refining Form* was one option, but due to his discoveries during cultivation and the First Sword Attendant's warning, Qin Sang had a premonition that he would also encounter a divergence with this demonic cultivation technique.</p><p>It proved to be true.</p><p>His journey to this point owed much to these two top-tier cultivation techniques. He originally thought they could take him further, but unexpectedly, he faced a choice at the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Aside from these, Qin Sang considered his other inheritances. Among the human techniques, there were the Nine Luminous Seals of Buddhism, certainly a major inheritance of Buddhist body refinement, but unfortunately, he possessed the seals without the corresponding Buddhist Dharma.</p><p>For the Poison Dao, he had the *Poison God Canon*, but it was incomplete, and the Poison Pearl was shattered.</p><p>He summoned the black and white chess pieces. The two pieces slowly rotated in his palm, forming a Taiji Yin-Yang symbol. This treasure was an artifact of the Yin-Yang Great Dao, but he still had little understanding of it, not even knowing its origins.</p><p>As for Thunder Arts, the Five Thunders Emissary Seal was incomplete, and he didn't know where he could obtain the Fourth Order High Divine Empyrean Thunder Scripture.</p><p>After considering everything, Qin Sang discovered that if he were to change his path, the most readily available major inheritance might be the Dao Court's Thunder Arts.</p><p>The problem circled back. He couldn't remain secluded; he had to venture out!</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, deciding to maintain the current situation for now, focusing on the *Violet Microcosmic Sword Scripture*. At least the Great Vehicle Path of Slaughter was clear, and the path ahead was illuminated.</p><p>Moreover, his Sword Dao was bright. Having comprehended the Four Symbols Sword Formation and the Sword Domain, he could dominate the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>From now on, the *Violet Microcosmic Sword Scripture* would be his primary focus, Thunder Arts secondary, and the *Celestial Demon Refining Form* third. After his breakthrough, he would be able to utilize the Sun Wheel Seal and the Azure鸞 True Thunder, achieving his current goals.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang extended a strand of divine sense, entering a stone mansion at the foot of the mountain and transmitting his voice.</p><p>"Gui Hou, Luo Hou, come up."</p><p>After halting the Heavenly River Inverse Slaughter Formation, the two Demon Marquises hadn't left, remaining at the auxiliary peak to guide the Red Plum Two Demons.</p><p>The Red Plum Two Demons were plant spirits, while the two Demon Marquises were beast demons. Their cultivation paths differed. For example, plant spirits couldn't cultivate the *Celestial Demon Refining Form*.</p><p>However, the Ghost Fang Kingdom also had plant spirits, and the two well-traveled Demon Marquises could still offer guidance to the Red Plum Two Demons.</p><p>The Red Plum Two Demons, with their close relationship, cultivated in the same cave dwelling. The two Demon Marquises sat, while the Red Plum Two Demons stood, listening attentively.</p><p>Hearing the summons, the two Demon Marquises immediately rose, bowing in acknowledgment, and hurried to the summit.</p><p>"We greet Great Lord," the two Demon Marquises saluted in unison.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the two demons, his gaze carrying a scrutinizing air, making them uneasy.  They couldn't help but recall the time they first entered the vast world hundreds of years ago when Qin Sang had observed them in the same manner.</p><p>"You've served me diligently, managing Azure Goat Temple, and have been fairly devoted. I've said that contributions will be rewarded."</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the bone flute to Gui Hou.</p><p>At first, Gui Hou was puzzled. He placed the bone flute to his forehead. Moments later, his eyes widened, and for a moment, forgetting his place, he urgently asked, "This cultivation technique only has the first four levels?"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly thought, as expected. After the fifth level, the techniques obtained from the bone flute varied for each cultivator.</p><p>Gui Hou could only see the first four levels, likely because he hadn't started cultivating it yet.  Once he switched to the *Celestial Demon Refining Form*, the most compatible technique would manifest with his bloodline.</p><p>A single bone flute was a treasure trove!</p><p>If the demon races of the vast world knew about this, it would surely cause further karmic entanglement. Was this what the First Sword Attendant had foreseen?</p><p>He would need to be more cautious when imparting cultivation techniques in the future.</p><p>"There are naturally more levels, but you'll only see them after you switch to cultivating this technique. Whether or not you change your cultivation is up to you; I won't force you," Qin Sang said calmly after retrieving the bone flute.</p><p>He preferred that the two Demon Marquises switch to the *Celestial Demon Refining Form*, and ideally, they would break through to the Void Refinement stage so he could observe the effects of true demon cultivation of this technique, using it as a reference and to verify his own understanding.  But that wasn't so easy.</p><p>Furthermore, if given the opportunity, Qin Sang would also collect other demon race cultivation techniques to compare with the *Celestial Demon Refining Form*.</p><p>The two Demon Marquises had previously presented their own cultivation techniques. They didn't come from prominent families or clans, and their techniques, bestowed by the Ghost Fang Kingdom, only reached the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Qin Sang also possessed Void Refinement stage demon cultivation techniques, specifically, the Black Demon Roc's technique.</p><p>But this was the true inheritance of the Roc lineage, requiring Roc bloodline to cultivate. Qin Sang couldn't practice it, and comprehending it was exceedingly difficult. He only knew that the Roc lineage, upon reaching the Void Refinement stage, would also focus on tempering their Dharma Idols, but not with Stellar Essence.</p><p>According to the two Demon Marquises, there were also demon races in the Ghost Fang Kingdom that cultivated using Stellar Essence, but unfortunately, he hadn't obtained their inheritances.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, dismissing them to consider their options.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling, the two demons looked at each other.</p><p>Despite only seeing the first four levels, they were deeply captivated by the profundity of the *Celestial Demon Refining Form*.  Their original techniques couldn't compare.</p><p>They hadn't expected a human like Qin Sang to possess a great demon inheritance!</p><p>They rejoiced at encountering the Dao, but amidst their excitement, they understood even more clearly that the Dharma shouldn't be transmitted lightly.  Once they accepted it, they would certainly be bound, their fates tied to Qin Sang.</p><p>However, even if they didn't cultivate this technique, did they have any chance of escaping?</p><p>Thinking back on the years they had followed Qin Sang, apart from their lack of freedom and the need to handle various chores, at least in terms of cultivation, Qin Sang hadn't treated them poorly. His demeanor towards them had been gentle, never treating them as mere servants, and after the Clear Sky Dharma Assembly, he had even brought back treasures as rewards.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't deceived them, perhaps by switching to this technique, they might have a chance to break through to the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Silence filled the cave dwelling, each demon seeing the other's eyes waver.</p><p>If previously they had been deterred by Qin Sang's power, afraid to harbor any disloyalty, now they were seriously considering pledging their allegiance to him!</p><p>…</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Outside the Azure Sky Grotto Heaven, Qin Sang, Solitary Cloud Elder, and the other two surrounded the island within the sea, standing at the four cardinal points. Between them floated countless points of light and numerous Seven Star Swords.</p><p>Four Void Refinement cultivators joined forces to establish the formation.</p><p>The sea surface remained calm, while the seabed churned, the spiritual veins of this place undergoing transformation.</p><p>With clearly defined roles, the four made rapid progress.</p><p>The points of light rose, transforming into a silver river. The Seven Star Swords plunged downwards, embedding themselves within the island. The Heavenly River Inverse Slaughter Formation was complete!</p><p>If Old Devil Zhen were to arrive now, he would find this formation unfamiliar.</p><p>Qin Sang's deeper understanding of the Star Dao had led him to drastically improve the formation.</p><p>Solitary Cloud Elder clearly sensed the vast difference between this formation and the one at Azure Goat Temple's auxiliary peak. He secretly marveled that the power displayed by Daoist Clear Wind previously wasn't even his full strength, and his profound understanding of the Star Dao further solidified his earlier judgment.</p><p>Having established the formation, the four continued casting spells, transforming the island peak. In the blink of an eye, pavilions and towers appeared.</p><p>"From now on, this place shall be called Azure Sky Water Palace!" Sect Master Ying declared with a smile, stroking his beard.</p><p>The other three nodded in agreement.</p><p>Sect Master Yu looked towards the forbidden area of the Water Palace where the Azure Sky Grotto Heaven's marker resided. "Each of the four sects will send a Nascent Soul disciple to lead a group and garrison this place, overseeing the formation. Should enemies invade, they can hold out until we arrive."</p><p>Tai Yi, Yu Lang, and other elite disciples from the three sects had been brought here and were waiting outside.</p><p>Everyone was filled with curiosity about the Minor Thousand World.</p><p>Orders were relayed, and the disciples entered the Azure Sky Grotto Heaven, setting to work.</p><p>Even with the combined efforts of the four sects, it would take time for things to settle into place.</p><p>…</p><p>Six years later.</p><p>Azure Goat Temple's auxiliary peak.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed someone approaching his cave dwelling and leisurely awakened. He heard Gui Hou's voice outside, "Reporting to Great Lord, Senior Master Yue has arrived."</p><p>Knowing that it was someone Qin Sang had mentioned, Gui Hou didn't dare to be negligent and immediately reported.</p><p>"She's finally here…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  After the Clear Sky Dharma Assembly, he and Senior Master Yue had parted ways. He hadn't expected it to take so long for news to arrive and had wondered if something had happened.</p><p>Glancing at the Skyeye Butterfly on his shoulder, Qin Sang smiled, "Your delicacy has arrived."</p><p>After his breakthrough, Qin Sang had focused his energy on the Skyeye Butterfly, jointly cultivating the *Panhu True Scripture* and refining its cultivation, only waiting for the Jade Origin Frost Flower Divine Liquid.</p><p>Qin Sang rose, lightly smoothing his Daoist robe, and teleported to the entrance of the guest hall.</p><p>Inside the hall, Senior Master Yue stood with her back to the entrance, hands clasped behind her, seemingly appreciating the hall's decorations.</p><p>Senior Master Yue turned around, cupping her hands in greeting, a smile gracing her lips. "Greetings, Daoist Qin."</p><p>"Please, have a seat."</p><p>Seeing her smile, Qin Sang felt reassured and entered the hall unhurriedly.</p><p>Senior Master Yue was straightforward, immediately taking out a jade bottle and placing it on the table.  "Please take a look, Daoist Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.  The jade bottle was entirely translucent jade, yet inside, specks of light swirled like dancing snowflakes, drawing one's attention into a miniature world of frost and snow.</p><p>Within his Qi Sea, the Skyeye Butterfly stirred restlessly, seemingly impatient.</p><p>It was the Jade Origin Frost Flower Divine Liquid!</p><p>Judging by its color, it was of the highest quality.</p><p>Senior Master Yue took credit, saying, "Refining this spiritual medicine was the most meticulous and cautious endeavor of my life. Thankfully, I did not fail my mission."</p><p>Qin Sang was naturally overjoyed. "You've put in much effort, Fellow Daoist.  I'm deeply grateful."</p><p>He didn't rush to take the Jade Origin Frost Flower Divine Liquid, his gaze remaining on Senior Master Yue, knowing that she hadn't come merely to deliver the medicine.</p><p>As expected, Senior Master Yue retrieved another item, a dried yellow leaf with exceptionally intricate veins. Qin Sang couldn't identify what kind of leaf it was.</p><p>"If you wish to journey to the Great Zhou Dynasty, Daoist Qin, take this token and go to Extreme Heaven Peak to meet someone named Mr. Hong. Upon meeting Mr. Hong, wait patiently for the Radiant Gold City's steward to arrive. Mr. Hong will make the arrangements; do not inquire about anything else."</p><p>"Mr. Hong?"</p><p>The person sounded rather mysterious. Seeing that Senior Master Yue didn't intend to explain further, Qin Sang nodded, indicating he had memorized the information.</p><p>Senior Master Yue continued, "The Radiant Gold City doesn't operate on a fixed schedule.  It usually comes every few decades. If you've made your decision, Daoist Qin, it's best to depart early."</p><p>Seeing that Senior Master Yue had made all the arrangements, Qin Sang reciprocated, immediately taking out a jade slip.</p><p>He had pre-inscribed a portion of the *Panhu True Scripture*'s pill formulas onto the jade slip.</p><p>Senior Master Yue's eyes lit up. Putting down the yellow leaf, she picked up the jade slip and eagerly began examining it.</p><p>Her expression became entranced.  After a long while, she sighed softly, "The Witch Clan's alchemy is truly wondrous!"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't directly given her the *Panhu True Scripture*, but he discussed the Dao with Senior Master Yue, sharing some of his understanding to help her comprehension.</p><p>"I hope Fellow Daoist will keep my intent to travel to the Great Zhou Dynasty confidential," Qin Sang said earnestly.</p><p>Senior Master Yue glanced towards the hall entrance. As an ancestor of her own sect, she understood perfectly.  She smiled and said, "I'll be looking forward to your return, Daoist Qin, hoping you'll bring back some Witch Clan secret arts."</p><p>Qin Sang replied frankly, "If the opportunity arises, I'll keep an eye out for you, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>However, Qin Sang himself didn't know when he would return.</p><p>Senior Master Yue stayed for a few more days before bidding farewell, leaving behind the Jade Origin Frost Flower Divine Liquid and the yellow leaf.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly was just a step away from its sixth transformation.  With everything prepared, Qin Sang planned to make his decision after the Skyeye Butterfly's breakthrough.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Spring turned to autumn.</p><p>Eighteen years had passed.</p><p>On this day, the cave dwelling atop the auxiliary peak opened, and a figure shot westward.</p><p>Flying past Moon's Lament Bay and continuing west for a while, Qin Sang arrived at a desolate stretch of sea before halting his escape technique and landing on the water's surface.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly lightly fluttered its wings on his shoulder. After years of accumulation and refinement, its aura was perfectly harmonious. It was time for its tribulation!</p><p>Because the Skyeye Butterfly needed to devour the tribulation lightning, caution was necessary. To avoid prying eyes, Qin Sang brought it to the deep sea for its breakthrough.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Qin Sang opened the jade bottle.</p><p>A refreshing, invigorating aura wafted out.  The Skyeye Butterfly's wings beat noticeably faster. It reverted to its true form, a giant butterfly, and suddenly lunged towards Qin Sang's hand, desperately trying to pry his fingers open, but it couldn't budge. A委屈ed thought transmitted, on the verge of tears.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily, ceasing his teasing. He guided the spiritual medicine from the bottle, transforming it into a ribbon that flew towards the Skyeye Butterfly.</p>
