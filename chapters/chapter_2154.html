<h1>Chapter 2144: Increasing Strength</h1><p>Qin Sang retrieved the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle, instantly filling the room with golden radiance.</p><p>Inactive, the shackle was merely palm-sized.  Qin Sang held it, carefully examining it.  The lock was tightly clasped, its surface etched with faint cloud patterns.</p><p>Qin Sang attempted to probe the shackle with his divine sense, clearly perceiving its spiritual nature.  The nascent spirit within had already gestated to a considerably advanced stage, not far from its metamorphosis.  For spirit treasures, crossing this threshold meant the birth of a tool spirit within the nascent spirit, defying fate itself. However, this hurdle was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.  Countless powerful spirit treasures remained eternally trapped before this stage.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang touched the nascent spirit, he felt a strong sense of rejection.  Conventionally, if a cultivator and a spirit treasure were highly compatible, they would sense it instantly upon contact, easily gaining the treasure's recognition.</p><p>The nascent spirit of a spirit treasure, yet to develop sentience, was driven solely by instinct.  If not initially recognized by the spirit treasure, it was almost impossible for it to willingly accept a master later.  The only recourse was to forcibly subdue it using the "Treasure Mastery Canon."</p><p>For years, many Artifact Refiners had spared no time or effort, delving into methods to subdue spirit treasures.  Similar secret techniques emerged endlessly, yet their effectiveness varied drastically.</p><p>For instance, most secret techniques relied on stringent conditions that ordinary cultivators found difficult to meet.  Some techniques, though enabling cultivators to wield spirit treasures, damaged their spiritual nature, greatly diminishing their power. Others took the opposite approach, preserving the spirit treasures but demanding a significant price from the cultivators. Unless the treasure's power was exceptional, it wasn't worth the cost.</p><p>Of all these methods, truly perfect ones were few, mostly held by grand lineages and powerful forces specializing in the Art of Artifact Refinement.</p><p>Secret techniques varied in quality.</p><p>Relying on the Boundless Blood Mulberry and utilizing the Blood Defilement Divine Light was undoubtedly one of the most superior secret techniques, even capable of subduing the tool spirits of Acquired Spirit Treasures and Innate Spirit Treasures.</p><p>This was precisely why the Boundless Blood Mulberry was ranked among the Ten Divine Trees.</p><p>While possessing the Boundless Blood Mulberry, Qin Sang lacked the corresponding secret technique.  Directly defiling the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle with the Blood Defilement Divine Light might enrage the spirit treasure, producing the opposite effect.</p><p>The secret technique he had obtained from the Five Elements Alliance was called the Grand Equilibrium Art.</p><p>This was one of the best secret techniques accessible to guest elders of the Five Elements Alliance. Certainly not the most potent technique in their possession, it inevitably had its drawbacks. But these flaws were acceptable. With Qin Sang's proficiency in the Art of Artifact Refinement, after careful study, he might be able to compensate for the shortcomings, minimizing the technique's impact on the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle.</p><p>Qin Sang had already formulated some ideas, waiting to be tested.</p><p>The "Profound Manual" contained a Blood Refinement technique that could deepen the connection between a cultivator and a spirit treasure. Qin Sang intended to nourish the spirit treasure with his own lifeblood.</p><p>Before employing the Grand Equilibrium Art, he needed to refine eight golden figures.  Qin Sang had planned this for a long time, and the spirit materials for crafting the golden figures were all prepared.</p><p>He entered the refining chamber, placing the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle aside.  The Myriad Ton Ring shimmered, and streams of light shot out, hovering in mid-air, nearly filling the chamber.</p><p>Countless types of spirit materials, seemingly incredibly complex, were methodically tossed into the spirit fire by Qin Sang. His timing and control of the flames were impeccable, demonstrating his mastery.</p><p>Gradually, a faint dark gold light emerged from the flames.</p><p>After a while, the entire refining chamber was bathed in a dark gold sheen. Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.  He struck the spirit fire with his palm, and the flames vibrated, splitting from the center. A dark gold light shot out, landing beside Qin Sang.</p><p>*Thump!*</p><p>The ground trembled, as if under immense weight.</p><p>This was a golden figure, half a man tall, with distinct features and limbs. It sat cross-legged, hands resting palms up on its knees, eyes open, gazing straight ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the golden figure, nodding in satisfaction. Then he continued refining, his movements fluid, producing one golden figure after another. Even with his cultivation, it took two failed attempts before he successfully refined all eight golden figures.</p><p>Putting away the remaining spirit materials, Qin Sang waved his sleeve, and the eight golden figures scattered with a thud, each occupying a position corresponding to the Eight Trigrams.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, silently recalling the Grand Equilibrium Art.  He had studied this secret technique beforehand but still had some uncertainties, needing the eight golden figures to aid his comprehension.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's aura underwent a subtle change.  Drawn by his Qi, the golden light on the eight figures was pulled towards him, dyeing his skin a dark gold color.</p><p>Then, the eight golden figures seemed to come alive.  A strange gleam flickered in their eyes as they slowly turned to gaze at Qin Sang. They raised their right arms, index fingers pointing towards him.</p><p>The eight golden figures maintained this posture, exhibiting no other unusual phenomena.  Yet, a profound Qi continuously flowed between Qin Sang and the figures.</p><p>Qin Sang's brows furrowed and relaxed intermittently.  Finally, he nodded slowly, uttering, "So that's how it is," and exhaled a long breath, ceasing his technique.</p><p>The eight golden figures lowered their arms, returning to their previous state.</p><p>Qin Sang meditated briefly to adjust his breathing, then summoned the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle, letting it hover above his head.  Simultaneously, he activated the secret technique, striking eight hand seals in succession, which melted into the eight golden figures.</p><p>"Hum!"</p><p>The golden figures rose into the air, surrounding the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle.  Like before, they raised their arms, fingers pointed at the shackle.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in place, fully activating the secret technique. At intervals, a faint ripple emanated from the void, causing the golden light on the figures to rise and fall. Then, a golden light would surge from their fingertips towards the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle.</p><p>Before long, the shackle was enveloped in a dark golden light, as if encased within a golden embryonic core.</p><p>Qin Sang's movements became increasingly rapid, hand seals flashing. Some struck the golden figures, while most melted into the golden embryonic core.</p><p>Mysterious patterns emerged on the surface of the shackle within the core, growing denser, seemingly penetrating inwards.  Qin Sang's perception became clearer. The formless power generated by the Grand Equilibrium Art was approaching the nascent spirit of the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle.</p><p>As if instinctively sensing danger, the shackle grew restless.  Qin Sang immediately interrupted the secret technique.</p><p>Looking at the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle now, it trembled within the golden embryonic core. The eight golden figures continued their work, but in a way that wouldn't alarm the spirit treasure, slowly allowing it to adapt and accept.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hands to his chest, palms cupped together, continuing to operate the Grand Equilibrium Art. Golden droplets condensed in his palms, gradually filling them.  Qin Sang seemed to be expending a great deal of energy, his expression becoming somewhat haggard.</p><p>The golden liquid divided into eight portions, flowing into the eight golden figures.</p><p>Soon, the golden embryonic core became as dense as water, and the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle calmed down. The hall was silent, but changes continued to unfold silently.</p><p>Sensing the Qi on the eight golden figures, Qin Sang nodded inwardly. Subduing the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle was a gradual process.  With the aid of the eight golden figures, he didn't need to remain here constantly.</p><p>However, this golden liquid would eventually be depleted and needed replenishing at intervals, the strain on him intensifying each time. Furthermore, the eight golden figures could only be used once before losing their power and becoming useless, a considerable price to pay.</p><p>As long as he could refine the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle, these costs were worthwhile.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in meditative trance for a long time before his Qi recovered.  He rose and stepped back but didn't leave the refining chamber, settling down in a corner to cultivate, guarding against any unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>With a resonant sword cry, the Grey Warbler Sword leaped into the air, circling above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>Moments later, darkness spread, engulfing Qin Sang and the spirit sword.  Within the refining chamber, darkness and golden radiance occupied opposite halves, coexisting peacefully.</p><p>Inside the sword formation, a different scene unfolded.</p><p>The night sky was filled with璀璨 stars, forming a vast and boundless river of stars.  At a glance, it could be roughly divided into four regions.</p><p>The west and south were the brightest, their starlight distinct, each star clearly visible.  The north and east were two chaotic masses of starlight, seemingly composed of nebulae, with barely any individual stars discernible.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in the night sky, positioned at the center, taking in the four star regions. His gaze swept over the west and south.</p><p>The Western White Tiger Seven Mansions and the Southern Vermilion Bird Seven Mansions were fully formed.  The south was presided over by a true Vermilion Bird.  With the Vermilion Bird's breakthrough to the Soul Formation stage, the power of the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation had ascended to a new level.  It was a pity he only had one Vermilion Bird.  If he could gather all four sacred beasts, each with cultivation comparable to the Vermilion Bird, not only would deducing the sword formations become much easier, but the power of the Four Symbols Sword Formation would also reach terrifying heights.</p><p>With this thought flashing through his mind, Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the east and north.  After pondering for a moment, he decided to first deduce the Eastern Azure Dragon Sword Formation.  For him, both sword formations were at the same starting point, making little difference which came first.</p><p>With a flicker, Qin Sang appeared at the center of the nebula.  Chaotic shadows and filaments of light drifted around him, like stardust pervading the void.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the void, gazing at the nebula, his mind filled with complex thoughts.</p><p>The Four Symbols Sword Formation shared certain commonalities. He first recalled the process of comprehending the Western White Tiger Sword Formation and deducing the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation.</p><p>Then, he recalled the enlightenment he had gained on the Sword Path within the Purple Star Palace.  The enlightenment was vague, but incredibly valuable.  By diligently pondering and discerning the underlying principles, he could use it as the backbone for further deduction, preventing him from straying off course.</p><p>Next, images flashed through Qin Sang's mind, scenes he had witnessed in the Divine Court.</p><p>The Talisman God resided within the Divine Court, each divine hall representing a star, arranged according to the laws of the celestial constellations.</p><p>Recalling the Eastern Azure Dragon star region and referencing the Daoist scriptures he had studied previously, all of these could assist him in deducing the sword formation.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang's initial intention to create the Celestial Star Sword Formation originated from the Divine Court, which he continued to use as a reference. Once the sword formation reached completion in the future, it could be considered a lineage stemming from the Divine Court's Dou Department.</p><p>And most importantly, over the years, he had gained insights from comprehending Tian Yue's sword light and the Sword Domain.</p><p>These elements intermingled, making it difficult to unravel the threads at once.</p><p>Qin Sang's brows knitted tightly, his eyes glazed over as he immersed himself in contemplation, his hand unconsciously stirring the void before him.</p><p>The nebula churned as he stirred it, as if swept by a storm. The surrounding nebulae vibrated, colliding and merging.  Originally evenly distributed in the void, the nebulae began to disperse and coalesce.</p><p>Where they coalesced, stardust accumulated, the starlight intensifying, forming ribbon-like or wisp-like bands of stardust.  These bands continued to condense, as if drawn towards the center by an invisible force.</p><p>First, a massive disk of stardust formed, then a loose sphere, surrounded by swirling stardust.  The sphere continued to compress, and a star was born!</p><p>Hidden beneath the surface phenomenon was the transformation of sword intent.</p><p>This star hovered before Qin Sang, exuding a chilling sword intent. It was a Sword Star!</p><p>"This can be the first star of the Horn mansion…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured as he gazed at the star.</p><p>His words were like a decree!</p><p>The star trembled violently, suddenly shooting towards the depths of the nebula.  Wherever it passed, the nebulae parted, until it finally settled at a specific point in the night sky, hanging high, radiating brilliant light that illuminated the entire star region.</p><p>The Horn mansion was the first mansion of the East. This was the first star of the first mansion!</p><p>The establishment of this star held profound significance.</p><p>A smile appeared on Qin Sang's lips. Suddenly sensing something, he hastily withdrew from the sword formation and discovered that the eight golden figures had dimmed, the golden embryonic core also becoming extremely illusory.  They wouldn't last much longer.</p><p>"So much time has passed…"</p><p>Qin Sang had been so engrossed in deducing the sword formation that it felt like a mere instant.</p><p>He repeated the process, stabilizing the golden embryonic core and condensing golden liquid for the eight golden figures.  After adjusting his breath, he returned to the sword formation.</p><p>Gazing at the first star of the Horn mansion, Qin Sang reflected on the previous process, realizing that deducing the sword formation this time had been easier than anticipated.  The reason was obvious.  His cultivation was higher than before, and he had the accumulated experience from deducing the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation.</p><p>Moreover, there was another crucial factor.  With his increased cultivation, comprehending the true meaning of the "Purple Star Sword Canon" and the sword light left by Tian Yue became easier, as did his understanding of the Sword Domain.</p><p>Conversely, deducing the sword formation also provided reciprocal benefits, deepening his understanding of the Sword Dao and aiding his comprehension of the sword light and the Sword Domain.</p><p>For the remainder of his time, aside from occasionally emerging to assist the eight golden figures, Qin Sang completely immersed himself in the profound Sword Dao, oblivious to the outside world.</p><p>While Qin Sang was in seclusion, Li Yufu was following his instructions, mobilizing the power of the Storm Realm to select locations and construct Dharma altars.</p><p>With the spirit materials readily available, they only needed to follow the established procedures for construction.  Assisted by Su Nu and the Vermilion Bird, the progress was swift.</p><p>Across the three domains of the Storm Realm, Dharma altars rose one after another, mostly built in places with abundant spiritual energy and thriving populations, or at strategic crossroads.  Corresponding spirit formations, halls, pavilions, cultivation chambers, and other structures were also built, creating magnificent complexes that would serve as the official residences for the Celestial Officials of the Five Thunders Court.</p><p>Emerging from the sword formation once more, Qin Sang probed the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle with his divine sense again and found that the repulsive force had weakened considerably.  He nodded inwardly. Once the spirit treasure no longer rejected him, he could begin the refining process. During this period, not only had the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle gradually yielded, but the Eastern Azure Dragon Sword Formation had also taken shape.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the secret technique, condensing golden liquid and imbuing it into the eight golden figures. Eager to continue deducing the sword formation, the restrictive formation outside his door was suddenly triggered.</p><p>The visitor was Li Yufu.</p><p>Moments later, Li Yufu's respectful voice came from outside.</p><p>"Reporting to Senior Uncle, the Dharma altars for disseminating the teachings have all been constructed, with only the final Governing Altar remaining.  I wonder when Senior Uncle will emerge from seclusion?"</p><p>"Oh? The Dharma altars have been completed?"</p><p>Engrossed in his seclusion, Qin Sang had completely lost track of time.</p><p>The darkness receded like a tide. Qin Sang recalled the Grey Warbler Sword, leaving the eight golden figures and the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackle in the refining chamber. He opened the door and stepped out.</p><p>Next, with the completion of the Governing Altar and the dissemination of his teachings, his Daoist lineage would truly take form!</p>
