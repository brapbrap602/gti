<h1>Chapter 2198: The Power of Talismans</h1><p>The gentle woman was indeed the helper,  Lady Ping, whom the Immortal Child had invited.</p><p>“Sister Ping, should we go?” the young girl pouted. “We’re all acting on the orders of the Ancestor; we should each mind our own business.  They can’t expect us to blindly follow their lead, can they?”</p><p>Lady Ping was also hesitant.  “Master Si must want to discuss strategies for dealing with his enemy.  I heard he’d already asked Master Qi and the others for help, yet still lacked confidence in eliminating his enemy. He then sent a message to me, which shows how powerful his enemy is. Since the signs have just appeared, Master Si and the others probably wouldn't dare delay the important matter and gave up the ambush.  It’s a rare opportunity; it will require much more effort later.”</p><p>“That old ghost from Flying Rainbow Mountain? What kind of background does Master Si’s enemy have?  Isn't he a disciple of some Ancestor at the Zu realm?” the girl exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>“The letter didn’t give details, only mentioning that the person is an outsider cultivator, not from the Sacred Lands…”</p><p>Lady Ping put away the message, thought for a moment, and said, “I didn’t immediately agree before, only promising to discuss it after meeting. Changing my mind on the way is breaking my word. Master Si sent another invitation; it’s hard to refuse his request.  It won't hurt to meet him.”</p><p>The girl slyly smiled, “It’s because Master Si offered extremely favorable terms, making it impossible for Sister Ping to refuse, right?”</p><p>“You little rascal!”</p><p>Lady Ping tapped the girl's forehead, then rose gracefully into the air, speeding towards the direction indicated by the message.</p><p>The girl clutched her forehead, crying out in pain, and hurriedly followed.</p><p>Guided by the message, the two women traversed mountains and rivers.  Like Qin Sang and the others, they discovered the mortals living in this area and its unique features, secretly marveling at them.</p><p>They landed on the island far from where Qin Sang and the others were. After flying for some time, they finally arrived near the Panlong Cave.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Two beams of light landed, and both women looked at the entrance of Panlong Cave, their faces filled with astonishment.</p><p>Lady Ping gazed into the distance.  Her gaze fell on the direction from which Qin Sang and the Immortal Child had fled.</p><p>Both sides had chased each other here and then rushed into the Panlong Cave, leaving no time to erase their traces. Although some time had passed, their auras were mixed and difficult to distinguish, but the damage caused by their fight was clearly visible.</p><p>“They chased each other here from that direction…”</p><p>Lady Ping pointed and said gravely.</p><p>“The aura here is so chaotic; it seems like there are more than two or three experts. Sister Ping, can you tell who they are?” the girl frowned.</p><p>She had lived a secluded life and didn't know much about the Immortal Child and the others. Relying only on hearsay, she couldn’t identify these auras.</p><p>Lady Ping shook her head slightly.  She had met the Immortal Child and the others at a Dao discussion conference, and their relationship was casual.  The Immortal Child had somehow learned that she was looking for a certain treasure, and this had appealed to her; otherwise, in this serious situation, she wouldn't have gotten involved.</p><p>“I wonder what kind of enemy Master Si encountered?  Aren’t they starting to fight each other?”</p><p>The girl felt increasingly apprehensive, her pretty face full of worry. Since the Immortal Child’s enemy was an outsider cultivator, it was unlikely they would coincidentally appear here, meaning their current opponent was someone else.</p><p>It must be someone else from the Sacred Lands, a junior disciple sent down the mountain by the Ancestors!</p><p>The signs have just appeared, and the killing has already begun? Later, wouldn’t it become a bloodbath!</p><p>The girl was born in the Sacred Lands, had always been cared for by her parents and elders, and the Ancestor also favored her. She had a smooth life, almost never encountering any setbacks, and everything she needed for cultivation was prepared early. She had never experienced this kind of situation.</p><p>Furthermore, she hadn't yet broken through to the late stage of the Void Realm Second Stage; her cultivation was inferior to Lady Ping’s, and it was dangerous for her to survive in a battle.</p><p>“Little Yan, don’t worry. The signs have just appeared, and the situation is unclear. Even if there is competition among them, they wouldn't kill each other now. Perhaps they had old grudges or a dispute over some treasure.  It seems they’ve chased each other into the cave. Let’s go down and find out the truth. Wait for me up here for a moment…”</p><p>Before Lady Ping finished speaking, the girl kept shaking her head.  “Sister Ping, don’t leave me behind!”</p><p>Seeing Little Yan's expression, Lady Ping sighed inwardly.</p><p>Although Little Yan's cultivation was high, she lacked experience and the mindset of a strong cultivator. She was able to reach this level solely due to her talent and the support of her family's ancestor.</p><p>The Ping and Yan families were old friends. Before her departure, the Yan family had entrusted her to take care of Little Yan. She had thought it would be a simple task, but now she realized it wasn’t easy at all.</p><p>However, Little Yan’s spiritual treasures were all gifts from her family's ancestor, and the divine abilities she had learned were all taught by the ancestor, so her strength should not be underestimated, and this could make up for her shortcomings.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go together.”</p><p>Lady Ping pondered for a moment and decided to take Little Yan down to investigate, but it was merely for observation.</p><p>The alluring treasure in the fairy child's possession tempted her, but she would never risk her life for it; after all, it wasn't something urgently needed.</p><p>The two women activated their protective talismans and entered the cave, arriving at a fork in the path.</p><p>Ping Xianzi looked around, pointing towards the right path, a windy, blade-like corridor.  "They went this way…"</p><p>As she spoke, she noticed Xiao Yan staring intently at the left path, a bloody, treacherous route.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Ping Xianzi knew Xiao Yan possessed an exceptionally keen intuition.</p><p>Xiao Yan hesitated. "It feels like something's there… something that makes me afraid."</p><p>Ping Xianzi frowned slightly. "Perhaps Daoist Si and the others sensed something unusual and chose a different path…"</p><p>They flew into the windy corridor, proceeding cautiously, exploring as they went.  The wind had obliterated any traces, yielding no valuable clues.  They pushed through, emerging into a chaotic scene. After careful observation, they cautiously ventured further.</p><p>In the icy wasteland,</p><p>Liuli unleashed the power of the Emperor's Talisman, manipulating the frigid air to create a devastating blizzard.  The talisman's power filled the heavens, the cold air bowing before its might. The sky darkened, the scene growing increasingly terrifying.</p><p>At the heart of the blizzard, a white pillar of icy air pierced the sky – the epicenter of the storm's power.  Within the pillar, a cloaked figure hovered – the dark-robed cultivator.  While seemingly calmer than the surrounding chaos, the area was filled with an intensely chilling aura.  His robes were coated in frost, resembling a statue of ice.</p><p>The Silver Winged Drum floated above him, showering him with a faint silver light, forming a protective barrier.  Within the barrier, a fiery light flickered like a dragon, revealing a fire Ruyi, another of the cultivator's treasures, protecting him from the intense cold.</p><p>Previously confident in the Ruyi's protection, the dark-robed cultivator had underestimated Liuli's abilities, dismissing her.  He had gravely underestimated the Emperor's Talisman – the most mysterious and extraordinary talisman he had ever encountered!  It likely required a powerful cultivator of the Unity Transformation stage to even forge such an artifact.</p><p>Had he known Liuli's true cultivation was merely at the late stage of Divine Transformation, his estimation of the talisman would have been even higher.</p><p>He wondered where she obtained such a talisman.  If it were a gift from a powerful human cultivator, he had to consider the consequences of killing her.  There was an unspoken agreement amongst the elders of the Otherworld race:  the life and death of their younger generation within the Sacred Land was their own affair.  However, an outsider, a powerful cultivator from another race, might not be so forgiving.</p><p>Even if that powerful outsider didn't dare attack the Sacred Land, he didn't want to spend the rest of his life hiding within its borders.</p><p>Of course, the most pressing issue wasn't whether to kill Liuli, but escaping his predicament.</p><p>A black phoenix circled, repeatedly attacking the pillar, but to no avail – as it had in previous attempts.</p><p>The dark-robed cultivator hadn't exerted his full strength, but forcefully breaking through would come at a cost.  Even if he escaped, without severely wounding or repelling Liuli, it would be useless for the overall situation.</p><p>More importantly, he didn't know if this was the talisman's limit.</p><p>The dark-robed cultivator realized a swift victory was impossible. He decided to continue probing, gradually pressuring Liuli, hoping to force a mistake.</p><p>Meanwhile, Liuli sat cross-legged above the pillar, her aura radiant. The Emperor's image seemed poised to emerge from the light, descending upon her.  If the Emperor truly descended, she would likely explode and die.</p><p>Liuli's eyes were closed, her face pale and devoid of color, enduring unimaginable pressure.  Yet, successfully overcoming this ordeal would bring immeasurable benefits.</p><p>The dark-robed cultivator's decision against a direct attack suited Liuli. She didn't dare hope to kill him, but trapping him here was enough.</p><p>However, this respite was short-lived.  A sudden change occurred, originating not from within the storm.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Liuli sensed something, abruptly opening her eyes, staring intently at the edge of the icy wasteland, her expression grave.</p><p>She vaguely perceived two powerful auras moving through the chaos, drawing ever closer, both far surpassing her in strength.</p><p>Who were they? Human or Otherworld?  A chance encounter or reinforcements summoned by the fairy child beforehand?</p><p>Numerous thoughts raced through Liuli's mind. She quickly realized the newcomers were Otherworld powerhouses.  The dark-robed cultivator, having failed to escape, now faced a new threat.</p><p>If the newcomer is also an ally of Xian Tong, it shows he overestimates Qin Sang.  Inviting two late-stage Refinement Void cultivators isn't enough.</p><p>Should we give up immediately?</p><p>Liuli was at a loss. Otherwise, how could she and Qin Sang possibly deal with five powerful members of the Yi people?</p><p>Qin Sang had left a strand of his divine sense on her. She sent out a warning signal, but he seemed to be preoccupied and didn't respond.</p><p>He might be in the middle of something crucial. Liuli gritted her teeth, determination flashing in her eyes.  She produced an ice sphere—the Celestial Dew Pure Ice she had acquired earlier.</p><p>She had intended to use it to refine her Ice Soul Divine Light, but now, she had to use it here.</p><p>To gain something, one must first sacrifice something!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The Celestial Dew Pure Ice shattered in her palm, transforming into countless ice shards that danced on the wind before being swept away by the icy storm.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator at the storm's center immediately sensed the change in the cold energy; it became more ethereal and unpredictable. He became wary, glad he hadn't acted rashly. This woman clearly still held something back.</p><p>*Crack, crack, crack…*</p><p>The ice field erupted with even more intense cold, the surrounding chill intensifying the storm.  Simultaneously, the coldness spread rapidly, overflowing from the ice field and permeating Panlong Cave.</p><p>At that moment, Ping Xianzi and Xiao Yan were making their way through the chaotic scene, almost through the area.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Ping Xianzi suddenly stopped, calling to Xiao Yan.</p><p>Moments later, to the two women's astonishment, an astonishing wave of cold energy surged towards them, powerful and immense. In an instant, the floating debris and swirling lights were frozen solid.</p><p>*Crack, crack, crack…*</p><p>The ice spread rapidly, soon freezing the entire cave. An ice wall blocked their path, radiating a bone-chilling cold.</p><p>"What is this...?" Xiao Yan was stunned.</p><p>"It seems like cold energy emanating from deep within the cave. No!"</p><p>Ping Xianzi's expression changed. She sensed unusual fluctuations in the cold energy, more than one kind.</p><p>One felt like a naturally formed, extraordinary power of Heaven and Earth, dreamlike and mysterious.</p><p>Another seemed to be the power of talismanic arts, but it was extremely subtle and unprecedented; she couldn't fathom it.  She even had a vague feeling that this power was on a completely different level from her own, that the wielder was looking down on her from above.</p><p>To her knowledge, none of Xian Tong's allies were proficient in ice-type techniques, implying this cold energy likely came from their enemy.</p><p>She could only sense the cold, and Xian Tong and the others were nowhere to be found.  Had they been frozen?</p><p>Was this a warning from the enemy?</p><p>Ping Xianzi glanced at Xiao Yan. If they ignored the warning and broke through the ice wall, they might face a fierce counterattack.</p><p>The enemy hadn't revealed themselves, but even the fluctuations from the cold energy alone filled her with apprehension.  She would hesitate to act alone, let alone while protecting Xiao Yan.</p><p>"Sister Ping, it feels like someone is watching us," Xiao Yan whispered nervously.</p><p>Unbeknownst to her, Liuli in the ice field was even more nervous, closely monitoring their movements.</p><p>She leveraged the power of her talismans and the properties of the Celestial Dew Pure Ice, making the cold energy not only more powerful but also incredibly inscrutable.</p><p>Seeing the two women pause before the ice wall, hesitant, she felt a slight relief.  However, Liuli knew this wouldn't last.  It was unlikely to scare them off completely. If they insisted on pushing through, she would soon be exposed and put herself in danger.</p><p>She had done everything she could. How long she could hold out was now up to fate.</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>After leading Xian Tong and Chong Yun away, Qin Sang plunged forward, delving deeper into Panlong Cave.</p><p>The ancient forbidden realm within Panlong Cave was both an obstacle and an ally, helping Qin Sang escape several near-death situations and prevent Xian Tong and Chong Yun from cornering him. But without Liuli's assistance, he sustained further injuries, worsening his condition.</p><p>Regardless of his own state, Qin Sang quickly recalled the records of Panlong Cave, selecting a few locations that could be used to his advantage.</p><p>However, whether these places still existed was uncertain.  Along the way, Qin Sang had already encountered several ruined realms, their ancient prohibitions utterly destroyed.</p>
