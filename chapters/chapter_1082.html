<h1>Chapter 174: The Pursuit</h1><p>“He's still alive?”</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed Mu Laomo being besieged, and was just lamenting the demise of this long-time nemesis at Mount Yitian.</p><p>So many experts were present, yet none had noticed Mu Laomo's subtle maneuver, allowing him to slip through the cracks.</p><p>“I just activated the Fire Curse Seed, and I can still sense him, but it's very weak.  Even if he's alive, he's in bad shape. His physical body must be destroyed; he probably used some life-saving technique. He's moving stealthily, trying to escape in the chaos. What are you thinking?” Bai explained.</p><p>Qin Sang understood.</p><p>This was a golden opportunity.</p><p>If Mu Laomo successfully feigned death and escaped, both righteous and demonic cultivators would believe him dead. His past crimes would be written off, allowing him to wreak havoc again in the future.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the cliff where Mu Laomo had fallen, remaining silent. Bai didn't say anything more, leaving the decision to Qin Sang.</p><p>“A Core Formation cultivator hunting a Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivator…”</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled slowly; the thought itself was suffocating.</p><p>The experts were all occupied with the ancient demon, unable to be distracted.  It also sounded like there were further developments on Mount Yitian that had everyone on edge.</p><p>Compared to the ancient demon, Mu Laomo wasn't a major threat. Qin Sang couldn't rely on others to deal with him, as that risked exposing the grey energy within him.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu, his only connection, was locked in a fierce battle with the demonic soul, and his situation was unknown.</p><p>He had to do it himself!</p><p>It was an insane idea; no one would dare attempt such a thing.</p><p>But it wasn't entirely hopeless.</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow, pacing back and forth.</p><p>“Those two appeared suddenly, both as strong as Mu Laomo, and attacked without mercy. The jade tablet's power was astonishing. Mu Laomo was caught off guard; it couldn't have been premeditated. Even if he used a secret technique to survive, he must have paid a heavy price and is barely clinging to life.”</p><p>Qin Sang clearly understood how dire the situation had been.</p><p>“Mu Laomo is severely injured, no doubt about it.  He'll be affected by the Spirit Suppression Domain, and even more so now that he's injured. His Nascent Soul didn't escape, but so many experts, including Lingzhuzi, were fooled. That means the jade tablet's attack must have been capable of destroying a Nascent Soul, leading them to believe Mu Laomo was dead…”</p><p>“In the Spirit Suppression Domain, heavily injured and near death, relying on a secret technique to survive, how much strength could he possibly have left?”</p><p>“Lightning Manipulation, the Ten Kings Yama Banner, the Star Conch… I’m not weak myself.”</p><p>“Most of the renowned human cultivators are here and can’t be distracted. I don’t need to worry about someone interfering if I ambush Mu Laomo.”</p><p>“Even if there are Demon Lord’s followers at the foot of the mountain, their cultivation is insufficient to enter the Spirit Suppression Domain. Besides, a cunning schemer like Mu Laomo, having lost his physical body and with a severely injured Nascent Soul, would he dare to face other demonic cultivators?  They’d likely finish him off before I even got a chance. He’ll definitely avoid them and escape from another direction, which suits me perfectly.”</p><p>“But if Mu Laomo still has some strength left and the ambush fails…”</p><p>Qin Sang's face hardened slightly.</p><p>“This is an ambush. If it fails, I’ll immediately retreat to the summit. If Mu Laomo isn't afraid of being discovered by Lingzhuzi and the others, he can come after me.”</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, anticipating all possible contingencies.  Ambushing such a powerful enemy required careful planning and execution.</p><p>This opportunity was fleeting. If he missed it, Mu Laomo would escape the Seven Kills Hall, and finding him again would be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the rolling demonic energy.  The sudden appearance of the chasm gave him a bad feeling.  Looking into its depths sent chills down his spine.</p><p>There was something terrifying down there!</p><p>Unease settled over Qin Sang. He dared not linger and observe.</p><p>Moreover, he didn't know Senior Qingzhu's condition or if he could suppress the demonic soul.</p><p>The situation was unclear, and the outcome uncertain. He needed to prepare for any eventuality.</p><p>If he couldn't return to the Small Cold Realm and was forced to remain in the Boundless Sea, Mu Laomo's existence would be a constant threat, a thorn in his side.</p><p>“Wait! If Mu Laomo still has the strength to teleport, we might…”</p><p>Qin Sang was about to make his decision when a crucial point struck him.</p><p>One reason Core Formation cultivators struggled to defeat Nascent Soul ancestors was the inability to prevent their teleportation. Without restricting that, it was nearly impossible to kill them.</p><p>“Have you forgotten my origins?” Bai chuckled. “Although I’ve lost my cultivation, my judgment and insight remain. Nascent Soul teleportation isn't an unstoppable technique for high-level cultivators. Even if I can’t restrict it, his movements won’t escape my notice.”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned, then overjoyed.</p><p>Giving the Star Conch to Bai was the right decision.</p><p>“Let’s do it!”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately made up his mind.  He scanned the area, identified a route, bypassed the battlefield, and quietly descended the mountain.</p><p>Bai tracked Mu Laomo, noticing he started slowly, inching away to escape the Demon Lord’s and others' perception.  Only then did he dare to increase his speed, fleeing down the mountain cautiously, frequently stopping and changing directions.</p><p>As Qin Sang predicted, Mu Laomo avoided the other demonic cultivators.  Once he was sure no one knew he was alive, he deliberately circled around the back of the mountain.</p><p>This was when Mu Laomo was most alert. Qin Sang didn’t approach him directly but instead descended the mountain, concealed, moving silently through stone forests and ancient halls, ignoring forbidden zones and secret realms. He then slowly closed in on Mu Laomo.</p><p>As Qin Sang crossed a stone forest and finally caught up, Bai softly transmitted, “He’s just ahead.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, suppressing his aura completely. He slipped out of the stone forest, his figure merging with the shadows of the rocks, and commanded the Skyeye Butterfly to activate its divine ability.</p><p>With the Skyeye Butterfly's power, Qin Sang quickly noticed something unusual.</p><p>At the base of a cliff, a dry riverbed lay, its stones polished smooth by the long-gone water, still gleaming.  The riverbed was filled with fossilized plants, resembling countless tiny swords.</p><p>Within the fossilized plants, a subtle spatial fluctuation was moving downstream.</p><p>To avoid detection, Qin Sang didn't look directly at the source of the fluctuation.</p><p>He was secretly surprised at how easily he’d located Mu Laomo.</p><p>“Mu Laomo must be using a secret technique to sustain himself, exhausting himself to hide from the experts. He can't maintain it for long, which is why he fled as soon as the battle started.  His aura is unstable now, he can't conceal it…” Bai concluded after hearing Qin Sang’s description, echoing his thoughts.</p><p>Cautious, Qin Sang didn’t attack immediately. He maintained a distance, tailing Mu Laomo, observing patiently.  With the Fire Curse Seed, he wasn’t worried about losing him.</p><p>Before he knew it, they were nearing the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang had ascertained Mu Laomo's condition.  He had to act decisively before Mu Laomo left the Spirit Suppression Domain.</p>
