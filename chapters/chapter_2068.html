<h1>Chapter 2059  Silu’s Thoughts</h1><p>As Qin Sang expected, the Haitang Academy didn't pursue him relentlessly.</p><p>After losing his pursuers, Qin Sang first found a place to recover his qi, then returned to the Turbulent Wave Sea area without incident.</p><p>At this time, Su Nu had already brought the Siyou tribesman back to the agreed location. Before leaving, she had sensed the aura of the late Nascent Soul stage cultivator.  Even knowing Qin Sang's considerable strength, she couldn't help but worry. If Qin Sang hadn't sounded so confident, she would have considered sending the Siyou tribesman away.  Seeing Qin Sang safe and sound, she breathed a sigh of relief, quickly opening the cave's restrictions to welcome him in.</p><p>They had carved out this cave on a remote island, casually building a few halls.</p><p>"Where is the Siyou tribesman?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Su Nu pointed to a side hall, "He was injured. I gave him some pills, and he's recovering."</p><p>Qin Sang looked over. The restrictions here were personally set by Su Nu; he could perceive the situation inside the side hall through them. He discovered a long, faint aura within. The man was recovering here without setting up any additional protective formations.</p><p>Unless this person was naive, this action was meant to convey an attitude.</p><p>"Have you spoken with him?"</p><p>Rescuing this person was a risk, but his purpose was to have him guide them to the Mist Sea, so his agreement was non-negotiable.</p><p>If he was sensible, they could avoid some trouble.</p><p>"I haven't had the chance to have a proper conversation.  He's severely injured, with old wounds aggravated by new ones. Furthermore, he only recently broke through to the Nascent Soul stage—early stage of the Void Realm, according to the Yi people—and his cultivation isn't stable.  Any further delay could undermine his foundation and leave lasting problems. Considering his future usefulness to us, I let him recover first," Su Nu paused, "But he seems to understand the situation."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked, "Did you ask him where the other Siyou tribesman went?"</p><p>He hadn't sensed the other person's aura; it was easy to guess that the situation was dire.</p><p>Su Nu had already asked.  She said, "He's dead! To get him out, that person self-immolated using their essence blood and detonated a treasure, attempting to die with the enemy."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, thoughtfully saying, "It seems this person's identity isn't simple!"</p><p>He had just broken through to Nascent Soul stage, yet the enemy sent so many experts to capture him, even with a late Nascent Soul stage cultivator present.  Such attention meant his companion must be a powerful figure, at least mid-Nascent Soul stage, possibly late!</p><p>Such a strong cultivator willingly died for this person, meaning either a close relative or someone of extremely high status.</p><p>They already understood that the Celestial and Water Departments of the Yi people were merely alliances. The merfolk would not interfere in the internal affairs of the various tribes in the Water Department. Within a tribe, equality was naturally impossible, leading to a hierarchy.</p><p>Su Nu smiled, agreeing, "It seems we've caught a big fish.  It's a pity we're not from the Yi people; otherwise, we might be able to use him for great things."</p><p>"Not necessarily..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, "Let him recover. Until he leaves seclusion, you and I will take turns guarding him. How are other arrangements coming? Once he awakens, we should leave, barring any unforeseen circumstances."</p><p>Su Nu’s smile faded, "Lan Sha Prefecture frequently has cultivators venturing into the ocean, training themselves, and seeking opportunities. Some people saw a business opportunity, building treasure ships to take these people out to sea.  First, these ship owners are familiar with the surrounding waters, and second, having many people makes them less vulnerable to enemy surveillance. The first part of the journey allows them to conserve their strength, facing the later dangers at their peak.  Regardless of the news this person brings, using a treasure ship for the initial part of our sea voyage is the best option."</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Su Nu, having spent many years in Lan Sha Prefecture, was far more familiar with the place than he was, so he let her take the lead.</p><p>Su Nu nodded, "I've contacted several ship owners.  You watch things here; I'll go out and find out when they're setting sail."</p><p>"Very well. Those Yi people might still be searching for us. Be careful," Qin Sang reminded her, watching Su Nu leave, before summoning Jian Nu and the Qing Jia and Qing Yi brothers.</p><p>"What are your commands, Master?" Jian Nu bowed.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the two brothers.</p><p>Their journey across the ocean demanded a higher cultivation level than their Golden Core stage. Raising them to the Nascent Soul stage was a priority, and Qin Sang had long been preparing, providing many pills. The two brothers were diligent, making significant progress and were close to the fourth stage of the Yuan Stage—the threshold of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"During this time, please guide them, helping them break through as soon as possible," Qin Sang entrusted the brothers to Jian Nu. Though not of the same lineage, their paths converged on the Dao; he was more than capable of guiding them.</p><p>Jian Nu readily agreed and took the two brothers away.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then produced a jade gourd, obtained from the deceased Quan Feng tribesman—a type of spatial storage artifact.</p><p>A man almost perished in a sword formation, dropping this object in the process.  After some effort, Qin Sang managed to break the seal.  A quick scan of his spiritual sense revealed it wasn't a storage device containing valuables.  Qin Sang had anticipated this; such devices, holding things vital to one's life, are specially refined and impossible to steal unless the owner is dead.</p><p>While no great treasures were found, the jade gourd's interior was filled with neatly arranged, unrefined herbs and materials, rare even in the Human Realm.  Qin Sang immediately understood their origin.  The Otherworlders often come to Lansha Prefecture to trade with humans.  These must be goods brought from the Misty Sea, yet to be sold, and now unexpectedly his.  A fortunate windfall indeed.</p><p>He happily accepted them and sat cross-legged in meditation.</p><p>After an indeterminate amount of time, Su Nu had still not returned, when Qin Sang sensed a fluctuation in the barrier.  Awakening from meditation, he perceived that the side chamber's seal had been broken – the Siyou man had awakened.</p><p>Qin Sang stood and opened the door.</p><p>The Siyou young lord was pale, his injuries clearly still fresh, but his inner energy was stable. He was observing the surroundings when, sensing something, he looked towards the main hall.  Seeing Qin Sang, his expression tightened.</p><p>Knowing Qin Sang had single-handedly held off pursuers, battling several strong enemies unscathed, he understood the man's power and, without hesitation, bowed.</p><p>"Silu greets Daoist Qin!  My injuries prevented me from thanking you properly earlier; please forgive me."</p><p>Both knew each other's names through Su Nu, so introductions were unnecessary. Qin Sang sized Silu up, saying it was no matter. "Your old wounds remain unhealed, lingering for too long, affecting your foundation. It's troublesome.  But don't worry, here is safe; no one will disturb your recovery."</p><p>"Thank you both, for not only saving my life but also providing a place of refuge. I'm eternally grateful," Silu said earnestly.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, gesturing towards the main hall. "Daoist friend, are you free for a chat?"</p><p>Silu agreed and entered the main hall, taking a seat. Gu Ya, having received prior instructions, served some spiritual tea, standing attentively beside them.</p><p>Qin Sang motioned, "Please."</p><p>Silu's gaze flickered towards Gu Ya before he took a sip. Preoccupied, he didn't fully appreciate the tea, but still complimented it.</p><p>Qin Sang set down his cup, cutting straight to the chase. "Your noble bearing and cultivation suggest high status within the Siyou clan.  Yet, here you are.  Why were your pursuers so relentless, even to Lansha Prefecture?"</p><p>Silu steadied himself, sighing. "Those Quanfeng people… we had no prior grievances. We encountered them unexpectedly; our identities were inadvertently revealed. They sought to capture us, returning to Shui Department for glory.  We were already injured, and unable to win, we had to flee.  We didn't expect them to have considerable influence here, repeatedly finding us."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "I see."</p><p>"As for earlier…" Silu hesitated. "We provoked a powerful enemy within our clan, leading to our escape."</p><p>Seeing his evasiveness, Qin Sang pressed him. "What kind of enemy?"</p><p>Unable to hide it any longer, Silu chuckled wryly.  "How much do you two know about our Otherworld clans? Each clan varies. The Siyou clan has a ruling royal family, bestowing titles and governing the land. I was a regional lord, cultivating in my territory, until a rival suddenly rose to power, attacking.  Allies feared him and refused aid; even some within my own ranks were bought off.  I hadn't yet broken through to Void Realm Second Stage. Isolated and besieged, I lost my territory and was driven to this."</p><p>Confessing his failings, Silu felt shame.</p><p>Qin Sang observed him, sensing no deceit, but suspecting this wasn't the full story.  "You ruled a region before reaching Void Realm Second Stage?  And your opponent openly attacked his kin, seizing your territory and relentlessly pursuing you.  Did the royal family tolerate this?"</p><p>He wondered about the importance of bloodline in the Siyou clan.  Top clans possessed countless masters.  Even royal descendants needed strength to command respect.</p><p>"Father left behind several loyal old ministers who protected me. As for the royal family, they didn't interfere, indeed, they welcomed the struggles between lords."</p><p>Indeed, even if I wanted to interfere, I might not have the ability. The royal family's strength isn't much stronger than some of the noble houses. Their highest cultivation wouldn't exceed the second level of the Void Realm. The elders who have reached the Saint Realm have all entered the Sacred Land to cultivate and are unconcerned with worldly affairs…"</p><p>Hearing Si Lu's words, Qin Sang's eyes flickered, "Sacred Land?"</p><p>The Saint Realm of the Yi people is equivalent to the Unity Stage of human cultivators. The Si You clan actually has Saint Realm experts!</p><p>"That's right," Si Lu nodded. "It is said that the Sacred Land contains things needed for cultivation beyond the Saint Realm. Cultivating there allows one to achieve twice the result with half the effort."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang suddenly realized something, slightly bowed, and pressed further, "What Sacred Land? Is it your clan's Sacred Land, or the Sacred Land of the entire Yi people?"</p><p>The existence of items needed for Unity Stage cultivators—any clan possessing such a Sacred Land would surely keep it strictly secret. Yet Si Lu revealed it so easily.  Doesn't the Si You clan fear attracting the covetousness of other clans?</p><p>Unless…</p><p>"It is naturally the Sacred Land of our entire Yi people! Regardless of the Sky Clan or the Water Clan, it is said that once someone reaches the Saint Realm, most, like our clan elders, enter the Sacred Land to cultivate. Unless a matter concerning the survival of the clan arises, the elders rarely appear; presumably, other clans are the same."</p><p>Si Lu had intended to use the elders' prestige, but reconsidered. At least in the Si You clan, once the elders enter the Sacred Land, they seem to cut off their earthly ties. There's no precedent of them appearing because their descendants were threatened.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't intervened, he would have already been a prisoner. If there are Saint Realm experts backing him, why haven't they appeared yet?</p><p>Such a claim is easily refuted and might backfire.</p><p>His current priority is to gain the other party's trust, protect himself, and accumulate strength.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were deep, and he mused inwardly, never expecting this to be the situation among the Yi people.</p><p>Saint Realm experts are hidden in the Sacred Land, unconcerned with worldly affairs. In other words, the strongest experts of the Yi people in the mortal world are at most in the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>After a brief exchange with Elder Quan, he has a rough understanding of the strength of late Nascent Soul stage cultivators. Once he breaks through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, with his magical abilities and treasures, he might not be afraid of them!</p><p>Previously, believing the Yi people to have countless experts, fearing the accidental arrival of a Unity Stage cultivator, Qin Sang had proceeded cautiously with each step. Now, knowing he doesn't have to face such a strong opponent, he feels greatly relieved.</p><p>However, Si Lu didn't completely rule it out; there might still be Unity Stage cultivators in the mortal world. The Yi people are a vast power with numerous internal clans, and external threats from other races, someone must manage the overall situation.</p><p>Moreover, if he attracts several late Nascent Soul stage experts, he would also have to flee, so he still needs to be cautious in the future.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, Si Lu couldn't hold back and said, "Two Daoists saved me.  What are your instructions? Please speak frankly, so I can have peace of mind."</p><p>He was prepared to be commanded.</p><p>Xia Changshi's last words still echoed in his ears: "Cherish your life.  A living man can always bounce back!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Si Lu, channeled a wisp of spiritual energy, and manifested an image in mid-air –  the Chang You people from Gu Ya's memories.</p><p>"This clan is called Chang You, also an Yi clan in the Misty Sea. Do you recognize them?"</p><p>Si Lu stared at the image, pondered for a long time, and shook his head slightly, ashamedly saying, "Previously, I was eager to break through to the second level of the Void Realm, focusing entirely on cultivation. The clan provided everything I needed; I rarely concerned myself with external matters.  Regarding the internal affairs of the Sky Clan, I only know some famous upper clans, and truly have no knowledge of this clan. However…"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, seeing that he seemed to have more to say, and didn't interrupt.</p><p>Si Lu pondered, "Judging from their appearance and the magical abilities you mentioned, I'm reminded of the Zhu Yan clan.  It is said that this clan and some of their vassal clans have appearances similar to apes. The Chang You clan might be a vassal clan affiliated with the Zhu Yan clan."</p><p>Through Si Lu's explanation, Qin Sang learned that the Sky Clan revered the Feather People clan as its king, but there were also many powerful clans. In major matters, even the Feather People clan would consult with them.</p><p>These large clans would attract smaller clans to become their vassals, known as upper clans, while the smaller clans were called vassal clans.</p><p>Upper and vassal clans are relative terms; vassalage wasn't complete subservience.</p>
