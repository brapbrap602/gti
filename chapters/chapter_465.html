Chapter 458: Sword Escape


After leaving Stargazing Island, Qin Sang, his brow furrowed, flew towards his cave dwelling on a cloud.
Hearing the sound of a sword behind him, Qin Sang stopped and turned to see Senior Brother Rong catching up.
“Junior Brother Qin, what are your thoughts?  Any plans for cooperation?  Shall we agree on a meeting point after entering the Finger Point Peak to rendezvous?  Or do you have another plan…”
Both slowed their speed and flew side-by-side.
After listening to Senior Brother Rong, Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then slowly shook his head.
“Junior Brother understands the saying ‘one tree cannot make a forest,’ but cooperation on Finger Point Peak is too difficult. Senior Brother also heard what Senior Xiao said: after the restriction is lifted, we will only have less than an hour to collect the Star Yuan Stones.
“According to the illusion Senior Xiao showed us, Finger Point Peak is vast and towering, with a wide range, complex terrain, and numerous restrictions.
“Finger Point Peak is so large, and there are only sixty-six of us, scattered everywhere. Unless we’re extremely unlucky, it’s unlikely we'll encounter opponents.
“Senior Snake Woman's warning was merely to remind us to be prepared, to avoid unexpected setbacks.
“In this situation, cooperation is largely irrelevant. The most important thing is the Star Yuan Stones, and the biggest obstacle is the hidden restrictions on Finger Point Peak.
“After being scattered by the restrictions, we may end up in different locations.  Communication talismans are unusable inside, so rashly agreeing on a meeting point would waste too much time and energy, ultimately outweighing the benefits!”
This was the reason Qin Sang had been feeling uneasy.
This Finger Point Peak competition isn’t just a simple test of strength; his two magic treasures will have limited effectiveness.
Of course, strong power is indispensable; otherwise, one wouldn't even be able to pass the restrictions on Finger Point Peak. However, the final number of Star Yuan Stones one obtains depends largely on luck.
Qin Sang wasn't against cooperating with Senior Brother Rong.  Their time together showed Senior Brother Rong to be a good person, quite considerate of his fellow junior disciples, and he himself is no weakling.
It’s simply that the environment of Finger Point Peak doesn’t allow it.
Senior Brother Rong had to give up the idea of cooperation, sighing lightly: “Junior Brother Qin is right.  I discussed it with Shang Yi earlier, and we came to the same conclusion… I can only wish you good luck, Junior Brother Qin, and hope you achieve your goal.”
“And to you, Senior Brother Rong.”
After a few more words, the two separated and flew towards their respective cave dwellings.
While flying on his cloud, Qin Sang assessed his own situation.
Compared to others, his advantage lies in his two magic treasures and the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman.  But others who have reached this stage wouldn't be without their own trump cards.
Luck is predetermined, but effort is up to us.
It's a pity that Finger Point Peak appeared too early. If it were two years later…
Once he breaks through to the False Core stage, he’ll be able to wield the Ebony Sword more freely, using the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability during the man-sword unity and sword flight, greatly increasing his speed, far surpassing cultivators of the same realm.
That's why the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability is so coveted and awe-inspiring.
If he had time to return to the Boundless Valley and extract the dragon essence to enhance the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, his escape speed would be even faster.
Qin Sang had a certain understanding of the strength of Core Formation cultivators.  He estimated that with the Sword Qi Thunder Sound combined with the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, his escape speed would surpass that of Foundation Establishment cultivators, comparable to early Core Formation experts.
This speed would certainly play a powerful role on Finger Point Peak.
Missing this opportunity was beyond Qin Sang's control.  Since entering the immortal path, he had never relaxed for a moment; if he couldn't make it, he couldn't.
Qin Sang sighed inwardly, dismissing these useless thoughts.  He landed in front of his cave dwelling and habitually checked the restrictions he had left outside – everything was normal.
He opened the restrictions and pushed open the door.
Sitting cross-legged on a cushion, he activated the spirit gathering array.
Just as Qin Sang was about to enter meditation, he suddenly sensed something unusual in his cave dwelling.
Immediately, his expression changed, and he abruptly turned his head, glaring at a corner of the cave.
“Who’s there!”
At the same time, Qin Sang stood up, flashed to the cave entrance, and swiftly swept his hand across his waist. The Cold Gold Sword and the Yin-Yang Compass instantly flew into his palm, and the Ebony Sword in his primordial spirit was also poised.
Qin Sang stared intently at the shadow in the corner of the cave, his whole body drenched in cold sweat.  Even on the bloodiest battlefields, he had never been so terrified.
In the shadow of the corner was a dark figure, clearly humanoid.
His cave dwelling had been silently invaded!
His carefully set restrictions showed no signs of being broken; they were completely useless!
Who was it?
Or was it some kind of monster?
Qin Sang’s back was against the stone door.  A chill emanated from the stone door; a slight push would break it open, but he dared not move.
He could feel a faint wisp of divine sense locked onto him.
This wisp of divine sense seemed not malicious, but Qin Sang dared not act rashly.
His cave dwelling was still some distance from Stargazing Island.  The cultivators on the surrounding islands were weaker than him. If he couldn't defeat this person, neither could anyone else.
This is the Chaotic Island waters, with the Thousand Illusions True Water Array outside.


Those who can silently infiltrate this place are undoubtedly powerful.  Rash actions would only anger the shadowy figure; we might not even get rescued before they strike.

Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder if his magic tools had been compromised…

It's best to keep the situation calm first.

His mind was in turmoil, but he forced himself to remain calm, his thoughts racing. He took the initiative to speak:  "Friend, who are you? Qin has rarely made enemies. If…"

Mid-sentence, Qin Sang saw the shadowy figure slowly emerge from the darkness, revealing an aged face.  He was startled, pausing, and showing a look of surprise.

"Elder Jing? It's you!"

Recognizing the old woman's face, Qin Sang exclaimed.

The old woman before him was thin and stooped, her face deeply lined; she was Elder Jing, the owner of the secret shop in the Moonlit Market.

Among cultivators above the Foundation Establishment stage, such an aged appearance is uncommon.  It usually indicates an impending end and depleted vital energy.

Yet, when Qin Sang first met Elder Jing in the Moonlit Market, she looked exactly the same.  More than seventy years have passed, and her appearance hasn't changed in the slightest.

Furthermore, back then, Qin Sang had only recently broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage and found Elder Jing unfathomable, completely unable to see through her.  Now, nearing the False Core stage, it's still the same.

To Qin Sang, Elder Jing's aura was like a deep, dark spring, profound and mysterious.  He had only felt this way about cultivators at the Core Formation stage.

"It's commendable that Daoist Qin still remembers this old woman."

Elder Jing nodded slightly, the wrinkles on her face bunching together in a strained smile.

"How could I forget the help I received from you, senior?"

Qin Sang chuckled nervously, appearing relaxed on the surface, putting away his Cold Gold Sword and Yin-Yang Compass; however, the Ebony Sword in his spiritual consciousness remained poised.

There was no other reason.

Elder Jing's disappearance for so long, and then suddenly appearing and infiltrating his cave dwelling… it was highly unusual.

Elder Jing had a good reputation in the Moonlit Market, and Qin Sang greatly respected her, but that didn't necessarily mean his respect would remain unchanged after seventy years.
