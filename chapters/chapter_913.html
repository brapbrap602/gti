<h1>Chapter 905: Cutting Off the Escape Route</h1><p>Ignoring the enraged shouts behind him, Qin Sang entered the passage and swiftly darted outward.</p><p>Simultaneously, he transformed his palm into a demonic banner, unleashing the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>The Mixed-Elemental Concentric Rings spun out, encircling the Two-Headed Serpent.</p><p>The Black Serpent Mountain sect definitely had people stationed outside the island. Uncertain of their numbers, Qin Sang didn't dare relax. If he couldn't eliminate his opponents quickly, he would be surrounded.</p><p>The situation was chaotic. He had killed the black-robed figure in full view of everyone and snatched the treasure, making himself a prime target.</p><p>As long as the Black Serpent Mountain and Wandering Isle cultivators weren't fools, they would surely call a truce and join forces to eliminate him first before fighting over the treasure. After all, the treasure belonged to the Wandering Isle sect, and those cultivators had no feud with Black Serpent Mountain.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang commanded the Two-Headed Serpent to use its newly comprehended Azure Shadow ability. The Two-Headed Serpent grumbled; it hadn't fully mastered this ability, and each use weakened it.</p><p>However, under Qin Sang's stern gaze, the Two-Headed Serpent reluctantly obeyed.</p><p>The passage wasn't long, but the black smoke generated by the flag formation, despite corroding the fog and runes, was still being compressed by the spiritual array's power from both sides, resulting in tremendous pressure.  Fortunately, both Qin Sang and the Two-Headed Serpent were resilient and managed to break through the restraints.</p><p>The black smoke didn't seem to diminish, but the pressure suddenly vanished.</p><p>Immediately after, a surprised voice came from outside, "Is that Second Senior Brother? Did you get it?"</p><p>The voice was unfamiliar. Qin Sang realized this was one of Black Serpent Mountain's sentinels.</p><p>Waiting outside was a dwarf, the tenth disciple of Black Serpent Mountain, left to guard and maintain the flag formation and passage. He thought his fellow disciples had succeeded and escaped, so he was naturally overjoyed.</p><p>The next moment, the black smoke churned as two figures, one tall and one short, emerged.</p><p>The dwarf's joy instantly froze. "Who are you?!"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around and discovered there were only two people outside, one of whom was Zhao Songqiao.  He was instantly relieved and without hesitation ordered the Two-Headed Serpent to attack.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>The Two-Headed Serpent roared, its body trembling violently as an azure shadow detached.</p><p>The dwarf was furious. He thought that with Second Senior Brother's strength and the Beast King Banner, even if they failed to steal the treasure, they wouldn't be completely wiped out, let alone have the passage taken.</p><p>Maintaining the flag formation, he was completely unprepared for this situation. Now, realizing something was wrong, he could only react instinctively.</p><p>A vortex appeared on the dwarf's chest and abdomen, and the shadowy figure of a beetle-like insect was about to emerge.  He simultaneously retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, the dwarf's cultivation was inferior to the Two-Headed Serpent's, and facing the Serpent's divine ability, he had no chance of fighting back.</p><p>Before the Gu insect could emerge, the azure shadow, in the dwarf's horrified gaze, arrived before him.</p><p>A fierce wind rushed at his face. The azure shadow was incredibly swift.</p><p>Panic seized the dwarf. He found himself unable to move, locked by a strange force. Struggling frantically to no avail, he was struck by the azure shadow with a 'boom'. His protective spiritual light shattered like dried leaves.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The azure shadow passed through the dwarf's body, appearing behind him. It casually swatted Zhao Songqiao dead before slowly dissipating.</p><p>A large hole appeared in the dwarf's chest. His eyes were lifeless as he fell backward.</p><p>The Two-Headed Serpent staggered, panting heavily, listless.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qin Sang praised. The Two-Headed Serpent using its divine ability to kill the dwarf was overkill, but in this situation, the faster the opponents were dealt with, the better.</p><p>The Two-Headed Serpent glanced at Qin Sang and returned to the Mixed-Elemental Concentric Rings to rest.</p><p>Qin Sang hooked his finger, not forgetting to retrieve the dwarf's storage pouch.  He then looked around, eyeing the black flags.</p><p>With the dwarf dead, the black flags began to destabilize, but the formation didn't collapse immediately.  Simultaneously, Qin Sang sensed violent fluctuations from the passage behind him; someone was trying to break out.</p><p>Qin Sang turned, his gaze cold.</p><p>These Black Serpent Mountain cultivators had used him as bait, and he wouldn't show any mercy.</p><p>Cut off their escape route!</p><p>Qin Sang reached out, blasting true essence towards the black flags, attempting to retrieve them. Unexpectedly, the black flags trembled, scattering his true essence.</p><p>The flags were masterless, yet the formation remained?</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, then realized the inner and outer flag formations were likely connected. Even without a master, they could function independently.  Only by understanding how to manipulate the black flags could they be retrieved, or by waiting for the formation to be suppressed by the Illumination Island's grand array until it collapsed.</p><p>The situation was urgent. Qin Sang didn't have time to study the formation, so he could only destroy them!</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand, the Nine Nether Demon Fire billowed, and surged towards a black flag.</p><p>Suppressed by the Illumination Island's grand array and burned by the Nine Nether Demon Fire, the black flag only held on for a moment before igniting and turning to ash.</p><p>The rest was easier.  The black flags were destroyed one after another, the black smoke thinned, the surrounding white fog pressed inward, and the passage narrowed.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly heard an enraged shriek, followed by a terrifying wave of energy.  Startled, he turned and saw a surge of blood-colored energy flying towards him.</p><p>Within the blood energy, two blood-red dragons coiled around a figure.</p><p>He couldn't see the person's face, but Qin Sang could sense two incredibly cold gazes, as if they wanted to devour him, sending chills down his spine.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>Qin Sang realized the person within the blood energy was the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>The most terrifying things were the two blood dragons.  He didn't know what they were transformed from, but their aura was extremely powerful. Recalling the previous events and Fang's background, Qin Sang had a vague guess about the blood dragons' origin.  They were likely a notorious type of peculiar insect called Blood Corpse Insects.</p><p>Three-Transformation Blood Corpse Insects, and there were two!</p><p>Black Serpent Mountain's foundation was truly deep.</p><p>Fang had trapped the five Golden Core cultivators of Wandering Isle for so long, likely due to these two Blood Corpse Insects.</p><p>Behind the blood energy, another streak of light was rapidly pursuing. Judging by its aura, it was Head Elder Lu.  After all, Head Elder Lu was a peak Golden Core expert.  Not only had he survived the sea of blood, but he also had the power to counterattack.</p><p>However, Head Elder Lu's speed was slower than Fang, who was riding the two dragons, and he was falling behind.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang inwardly cursed. Even Head Elder Lu had been trapped for so long before escaping. If he were entangled by Fang, his fate would be dire.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. He didn't dare stay any longer. He poured all his power into the Nine Nether Demon Fire, fiercely engulfing the remaining black flags. He also activated the Ebony Sword, slashing towards the passage exit once more.</p><p>Then, he activated escape treasures like the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and, without looking back, vanished into the sky with a few flashes.</p><p>Riding the two dragons, Fang's speed was also impressive. He didn't know the details, but seeing Qin Sang destroy the black flags, he realized something was wrong.</p><p>Arriving at the passage exit, just as Fang was about to continue pursuing Qin Sang, he heard screams from within the passage â€“ the voices of his fellow disciples.</p>
