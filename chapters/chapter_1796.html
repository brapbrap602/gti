<h1>Chapter 1787: Breaking Through</h1><p>Qin Sang knew nothing of the exchange between Zhan Gui Zhenren and the others.</p><p>Zhij Jian Zhenren stood at the cliff edge, waiting for Qin Sang to emerge before taking them back to Sword Heart Island via magical flight.</p><p>“How did it go?” Zhi Jian Zhenren asked.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, “The Celestial Court wants me to infiltrate Gui Fang.”</p><p>Zhij Jian Zhenren wasn't surprised.  He and Qin Sang had discussed this possibility earlier, concluding it was the most likely scenario.  The Daoist sect had countless powerful cultivators; tasks that were easy or low-risk could be handled by the Celestial Court officials themselves. Only a mission fraught with uncertainty, like infiltrating Gui Fang, would be outsourced.</p><p>“They want me to investigate a certain secluded realm, supposedly near a demon king's manor. The details are unclear. Once inside Gui Fang, someone will contact me…”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly summarized the contents of the summons. There wasn't much to hide; he wouldn’t know the specific location of the realm until he reached Gui Fang. This also indicated further variables.</p><p>“Near a manor?” Zhi Jian Zhenren frowned.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, that was precisely his concern.  A manor referred to a Gui Fang prince's mansion, not comparable to a demon king's lair in the Storm Realm. A Gui Fang prince, commonly called a demon king by the Daoist sect, was equivalent to a high-ranking Celestial Court official—a powerful cultivator at the Void Refinement stage! He could mask his aura to appear as a demon cultivator, so he should, barring any surprises, be able to deceive other demon cultivators of the same level.  But there was no guarantee he wouldn't cause a commotion in the secluded realm. Although the summons stated it was some distance from the manor, Qin Sang couldn't ignore the possibility of attracting the prince's attention. He’d never experienced the powers of a Void Refinement cultivator, and he certainly didn't want to test his luck with his life.  Ironically, this summons was considered one of the easier ones.</p><p>After Zhi Jian Zhenren learned about Qin Sang's conversation with Zhan Gui Zhenren, he also shook his head repeatedly.  “Your luck is poor, friend. Both summonses are difficult and highly dangerous.”</p><p>Qin Sang, however, remained optimistic. “Luckily, I have you here.  Zhan Gui Zhenren was accommodating. The first summons was likely intended for a true Cave Xuan Zhenren. If they'd forced it on me, I would have had to accept it.”</p><p>They spoke for a while longer. Zhi Jian Zhenren asked about Qin Sang’s plans.</p><p>Qin Sang countered, “Have you reached a conclusion?”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren nodded. “While one piece of information remains unconfirmed, it's almost certain.  Yu Huang, Gu Yun, and I are preparing, and it shouldn't take long. I'll explain everything to you now…”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren looked around cautiously and cast a sound-proofing barrier before speaking.  Qin Sang, intrigued by his seriousness, listened attentively.</p><p>Soon, Zhi Jian Zhenren finished, looking at Qin Sang. “What are your thoughts?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, pondering.  Zhi Jian Zhenren and the others planned to venture deep into the Mire of Sin, confronting the Gui Fang demons.</p><p>“Capturing a demon marquis grants advancement?” Qin Sang asked gravely.</p><p>“A live capture is best; the Celestial Court will handsomely reward us. Even if we divide the reward, the Court won't be stingy with an advancement token. Killing a demon marquis is also a great achievement. Even if your contribution alone isn't enough, we'll give you a share. If you feel uneasy about it, you can return the favor later. We fellow cultivators should help each other.  Yu Huang and Gu Yun are not petty,” Zhi Jian Zhenren said confidently, as if killing a Gui Fang marquis was a trivial matter.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. Deep within the Mire of Sin was different from Gui Fang itself.  The four of them working together, with the element of surprise, had a good chance of success.</p><p>According to Zhi Jian Zhenren, the Celestial Court had discovered that Gui Fang demons were plotting something in the Mire of Sin, with a demon marquis active there. To avoid alerting them, the Celestial Court avoided a large-scale operation.  Cave Xuan Zhenren were usually sect leaders or held important positions and couldn't easily move.  Cultivators like them, with less prominence, were the best option for this task. But it was certain the Celestial Court would make other arrangements.  With enough patience, they could fish in troubled waters once both sides clashed.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren smiled again. “If we manage to uncover the demons' secrets, what's an advancement token? We might even secure guidance from a Grandmaster.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart pounded.  Guidance from a Grandmaster was an invaluable opportunity!  After receiving the Five Thunder Secret Technique, he would focus on cultivation, with Void Refinement no longer a distant goal.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't blinded by ambition.  The Gui Fang demon marquis would undoubtedly be cautious and likely move in groups, making it difficult to find a lone target.  More importantly, they needed to hide and wait for the right moment.</p><p>Qin Sang worried that if the matter was significant enough to warrant the Celestial Court's attention, it couldn't involve only a few demon marquises; demon kings might be involved. If they attracted a demon king, Zhi Jian Zhenren's outwardly strong but inwardly weak sword would hardly deter them.</p><p>The Sword Master saw Qin Sang's worry and changed his tone.  "Friend Daoist, have you ever witnessed a Grand Master of the Daoist sect in action? Have you ever heard of any Grand Master intervening in worldly affairs?"</p><p>"Never," Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Though unclear about the specifics, he had gleaned some information over the years.  Unless engaged in war with the Gui Fang kingdom, Grand Masters rarely left the Daoist courts, rarely appearing in the mortal realm.</p><p>"Because Grand Masters rarely leave their secluded retreats!"</p><p>The Sword Master glanced southwest. "Those who reach the fifth level of cultivation pursue harmony with Heaven and Earth, drawing upon the natural forces to enhance themselves, achieving near-infinite lifespans.  Their actions carry the might of Heaven and Earth. But precisely because of this, once a Grand Master strays too far from their retreat, their connection to Heaven and Earth cannot be hidden. Their presence is marked by wind, thunder, and unusual phenomena. The demon king of Gui Fang is the same."</p><p>Pausing, the Sword Master pointed towards the northern Wasteland. "Thus, it is far easier for us to operate. Imagine, if a Grand Master were to enter the Wasteland, they would be like a beacon in the darkness, driving all beasts wild. The commotion would be immense.  We would know long before we even approached the demon king."</p><p>"Harmony with Heaven and Earth..."</p><p>Qin Sang showed a sudden understanding.</p><p>Longevity is a concern for Yuan Ying and Hua Shen cultivators.</p><p>Upon reaching the Yuan Ying stage, one transcends the mundane, with various methods to replenish energy, lifespans become indeterminate, varying with cultivation methods, experience, health practices, and environment.</p><p>Even the lifespans of body cultivators, spell cultivators, and spirit cultivators differ.</p><p>Generally around fifteen hundred years, with variations of several centuries possible.  Hua Shen cultivators roughly double that.</p><p>However, heavenly tribulations are far more dangerous; most do not die of old age.</p><p>Once the Void Refinement stage is reached, only heavenly tribulations need be feared.</p><p>It is said that the Void Refinement tribulation is a six-nine tribulation occurring every three thousand years, far exceeding the four-nine tribulation in power. Therefore, reaching Void Refinement doesn't mean one can rest easy.</p><p>When Qin Sang learned that the key to breaking through to the Hua Shen stage lay in sensing Heaven and Earth, he deduced that Void Refinement might require achieving harmony with Heaven and Earth. He never imagined that this integration would have such drawbacks in this world.</p><p>The Sword Master, capable of wielding a sword almost comparable to a Void Refinement cultivator, must have received a great legacy. His knowledge is unsurprising.</p><p>Qin Sang’s curiosity about the Daoist court’s retreats grew.</p><p>The retreat, as the core of a court, seems to be more than just a place for teaching.</p><p>This made him realize that he had never heard of the location of the secluded retreat of the Mountain Court.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang asked, "How long do you intend to stay in the Wasteland?"</p><p>"It's hard to say. It depends on the distance and the situation, but it won't be long," the Sword Master explained.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang nodded silently.</p><p>If that's the case, he could go with the Sword Master first. If they returned empty-handed, he could then complete the summons.</p><p>The summons didn't specify a time, so it should be flexible.</p><p>He hesitated no longer and agreed.</p><p>...</p><p>Soon, the two returned to Sword Heart Island, where You Huang and Gu Yun were already waiting.</p><p>Learning that Qin Sang would accompany them, the two exchanged glances. They weren’t elated, but neither did they refuse outright.</p><p>They knew Qin Sang was striving for promotion.</p><p>You Huang turned to the Sword Master, "Friend Qingfeng is still a second-rank cultivator. The protective deities of the court can only protect those at the Sheng Xuan level.  The effects in the Wasteland will certainly be far greater on him than on us. We might last longer.  Should we return together later?"</p><p>Gu Yun added, "Though Friend Qingfeng has a Tranquil Essence Pill, it's only one. The situation we face is too complex. I'm afraid..."</p><p>Both voiced their concerns.</p><p>The Sword Master had not revealed Qin Sang's background to them before.</p><p>Qin Sang remained impassive.</p><p>The Sword Master laughed, "Master You Huang, don't worry. I happen to have several pills that stabilize the soul. Though they can't completely counteract the malign influences, they can serve as a temporary measure."</p><p>You Huang nodded slightly. They wouldn't stay in the Wasteland long. As long as their minds remained clear, they could recover later.</p><p>Then, the Sword Master looked at Gu Yun, "You underestimate Friend Qingfeng. Friend Qingfeng cultivates both body and spirit. When we last met, he displayed tremendous physical strength. With full effort, he could potentially hold off two opponents.  We may well depend on Friend Qingfeng in a critical situation."</p><p>"Body and spirit cultivation?"</p><p>Gu Yun's eyes widened in surprise as he looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Such cultivation is rare in this world, especially among those who cultivate at the Dragon Tiger Court.</p><p>Qin Sang replied simply, "Just lucky."</p><p>He had already told the Sword Master, so there was no need to hide it from these two, especially since they were all aiming for the demon lord and needed to cooperate sincerely.</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>The Sword Master stopped the eager Gu Yun, "I know you're eager for a fight, but now isn't the time for sparring. There will be plenty of opportunities to fight in the Wasteland."</p><p>Having said that,  Zhijiejian Zhenren turned to Qin Sang, "Before we leave, Daoist Qingfeng, is there anything else you need to do? Let's brainstorm and share information so we can prepare as quickly as possible, to avoid being caught off guard."</p><p>The Hui Feng armor was already refined, so Qin Sang actually had nothing left to do.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's mind turned, "Do you remember the Emperor Bell Talisman? I've been collecting materials everywhere, but unfortunately, I'm still missing Kun Earth Blood Sand, and I haven't had any luck finding it."</p><p>Zhijiejian Zhenren looked at Guyun Zhenren, "I remember Daoist Guyun has a piece of Kun Earth Blood Sand."</p><p>Guyun Zhenren immediately produced it—a fist-sized, blood-red stone.  A closer look revealed it was composed of countless tiny, rice-grain sized crystals.  With a little refinement, it could be processed into cinnabar for talisman drawing.</p><p>Qin Sang also took out the spiritual materials he had collected.</p><p>Zhijiejian Zhenren examined them and said, "These are enough to refine about three Emperor Bell Talismans."</p><p>Guyun Zhenren interjected, "I have a friend who is skilled in talisman making.  We could ask him to make them. I can provide any missing materials. If we get two or more, would you give me one?"</p><p>The last sentence was addressed to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Good," Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>In this world, every cultivator can draw talismans, but the success rate varies widely. Not everyone can become a master. Qin Sang estimated that if he were to make them himself, he might only be able to refine one successfully.</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>Guyun Zhenren laughed heartily, gathered up all the materials with a sweep of his sleeve, and put them away.</p><p>Next, the group discussed for a while before parting ways.</p><p>Qin Sang first returned to Hu Zhong Island, found Master Qi, collected his Hui Feng armor, and informed him that he would be leaving for a while.</p><p>Master Qi seemed quite reluctant to see him go, whether it was due to genuine affection for Qin Sang or attachment to the armor, remained unclear.</p><p>Then Qin Sang vacated his cave dwelling on Hu Zhong Island and went to Jianxin Island to cultivate.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he waited for a whole year.</p><p>During that time, Guyun Zhenren visited once, informing Qin Sang that only two Emperor Bell Talismans had been refined, one for each of them.</p><p>With the delay, when the four cultivators gathered again, Youhuang Zhenren began to suspect that the Daoist Court might have exaggerated the threat, making it all a farce and wasting everyone's time.</p><p>After several more months, just as Qin Sang was considering going to Guifang Kingdom to investigate, the news finally arrived!</p><p>…</p><p>Jianxin Island.</p><p>Qin Sang and Zhijiejian Zhenren stood side by side, while an elderly servant, who referred to himself as an "old slave," stood respectfully nearby.  Despite his considerable cultivation, he was unable to participate in this level of combat and had to remain behind to guard the cave dwelling.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Two streams of light arrived simultaneously, speeding towards them.</p><p>Upon landing, Youhuang Zhenren asked impatiently, "Is it confirmed?"</p><p>Zhijiejian Zhenren nodded, "Rest assured, Daoist friend, the source of this information is absolutely reliable! The demon lords of Guifang Kingdom are moving, heading in that direction. We haven't identified which demon lords are involved yet, but time is pressing, we can't wait any longer."</p><p>"How long ago did they leave?" Guyun Zhenren pressed.</p><p>"Two days ago, but the news just arrived," Zhijiejian Zhenren said gravely.</p><p>As top-tier cultivators, their speed wouldn't differ much; they must hurry.</p><p>"There must be more than just us, right? Taking it a little slower might not be a bad thing," Youhuang Zhenren's expression relaxed.</p><p>"Of course, there are others.  Everyone knows the Daoist Court's little tricks," Guyun Zhenren scoffed.</p><p>With that, everyone prepared themselves and set off towards the north.</p><p>They arrived smoothly at the northern shore of Xingdao Lake.</p><p>Before them stretched vast expanses of tall, yellow grass, so thick it resembled a dense jungle.</p><p>Even on land, the four continued to fly at high altitude.  The grassy plains were incredibly expansive.  They flew for quite some time before reaching the edge.</p><p>Fortunately, they didn't encounter a single beast along the way.</p><p>Zhijiejian Zhenren stopped at the front and said solemnly, "Dangerous beasts roam ahead. Everyone, be careful. If you encounter any, act decisively and quickly!"</p><p>Then he handed Qin Sang several jade bottles, explaining how to use their contents.  The bottles contained various kinds of pills, clearly the accumulation of Zhijiejian Zhenren's many years, all given to Qin Sang.</p>
