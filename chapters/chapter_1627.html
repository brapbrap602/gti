<h1></h1><p>Outside the Boundless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Numerous cultivators, each displaying their divine abilities, navigated the passage.</p><p>Qin Sang, accompanied by his avatar, initially proceeded cautiously, vigilant against pursuers. Once he was certain no one was following, he focused on breaking through the obstacles ahead.</p><p>Whether it was a solitary restrictive formation or a chaotic energy current, with Qin Sang's current cultivation, he had the means to cope.</p><p>However, these adverse conditions were intertwined here, creating extreme chaos, demanding considerable effort from Qin Sang.</p><p>Cultivators with weaker cultivation would have been overwhelmed long ago.  It was with good reason that Old Ghost Chou and the others had joined forces.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A fierce wind struck Qin Sang's face.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw only the afterimage of a crimson flying sword.</p><p>The sword energy was sharp, and Qin Sang felt a faint pain in his forehead.</p><p>However, before the flying sword drew near, the Skyeye Butterfly had already detected it and issued a warning.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly saw clearly that this sword was not a physical entity but a manifestation of sword energy, forming an illusory sword image.</p><p>Yet, its destructive power was no less than that of a real treasured sword.</p><p>Strangely, although it was an illusory sword image, the flying sword appeared as a broken sword, with only half a blade.</p><p>Could an illusory sword also be broken?</p><p>There was only one explanation: the spirit formation or restrictive formation that manifested the flying sword was damaged. This explained the chaotic scenes Qin Sang had witnessed since entering.</p><p>"Back then, not only were the two Southern Barbarian states devastated, but the Boundless Immortal Sect's mountain gate must have also suffered.  I just don't know if the mountain gate was affected by the demonic chaos or if it was destroyed by infighting among human cultivators after the demonic chaos ended..."</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. Seeing the flying sword approaching, he calmly directed his sword to slash towards the front left.</p><p>To his front left, a vibrant green light, representing life, shone brightly. Within the green light lay a lush jungle, with ancient trees and verdant leaves, a sight that brought peace to the heart.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one would realize that there were only a dozen or so ancient trees, the rest being their branches.</p><p>In places rich in spiritual energy, where vegetation thrived, such ancient trees were not uncommon. Using them to set up hidden traps often yielded remarkable results.</p><p>But in this environment, they were too conspicuous. Ordinary trees could never have survived until now. It was obvious that something was amiss; it must be some kind of residual formation.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword thrust towards the thickest ancient tree.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected, before the Golden Sinking Sword could strike the trunk, just as it approached within a hundred zhang of the ancient tree, the tree suddenly transformed, coming alive!</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Blinding green light erupted as countless vines shot out from the tree trunk like the ancient tree's hair wildly dancing, clawing towards the Golden Sinking Sword, instantly ensnaring it.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang's main body did not withdraw his sword, and his avatar retreated behind his main body, sheathing its saber.</p><p>‘Creak! Creak!’</p><p>The vines possessed immense strength, ferociously tearing at the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but suspect that if he didn't retrieve the Golden Sinking Sword soon, this magical treasure might be torn to shreds.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't need to confront the ancient tree himself.</p><p>The moment the ancient tree trapped the Golden Sinking Sword, the flying sword arrived, striking the vines precisely, everything unfolding just as Qin Sang had calculated!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Within the green light emitted by the vines, a crimson spark suddenly burst forth. The power of the flying sword was like a raging torrent of flames, engulfing countless vines and surging forward.</p><p>The crimson light, like fire, incinerated the vines with devastating force.</p><p>The vines were an extension of the ancient tree's power. Under attack, the ancient tree reacted immediately, its trunk swaying as the entire forest grew wildly.</p><p>The trunks of all the ancient trees extended, twisting beyond recognition, the green tide surging as if determined to extinguish the flames of the flying sword.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't wait to see the outcome of the clash between these two forces.  Seizing the opportunity, he retrieved the Golden Sinking Sword and, with a series of flashes, slipped through the gap.</p><p>Engrossed in their battle, the flying sword and the ancient tree formation paid little attention to Qin Sang's approach.</p><p>He effortlessly bypassed this perilous obstacle.</p><p>Relying on early warnings and his ability to quickly analyze formations, Qin Sang frequently employed this method of leveraging strength against strength, achieving great results with minimal effort.</p><p>Along the way, the Skyeye Butterfly had been of immense help.</p><p>Although not as efficient as Zhu Wudao and the others relying on their Dharma altars, or Zi Lei Zhenren and the others combining their power in formations, his speed was considerable.</p><p>Despite this, after entering the passage, Qin Sang still hadn't encountered anyone who had entered before him.  He wondered if the others possessed secret treasures and divine abilities, making them even faster, or if the area was simply too vast, and they had inadvertently missed each other.</p><p>Qin Sang deduced that the space within the passage couldn't be measured by conventional means. Clearly, the influence of formations and restrictions was at play, leading to various unexpected events and unknowingly diverting people to different paths.</p><p>Moreover, this place was ever-changing. Even if they traveled the same path, each person's experience would be different.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Skyeye Butterfly devoted all their efforts to avoid getting lost. Otherwise, even if they could escape, they would fall far behind and miss opportunities for exploration.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>Having just moved beyond the influence of the ancient tree formation, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something amiss and abruptly stopped.</p><p>He looked around.</p><p>He was suspended in the void, with nothing above or below, surrounded by endless darkness, with chaotic currents streaking past like meteors.</p><p>His divine sense and the Skyeye Butterfly worked in tandem.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang realized, "It's an illusion formation!"</p><p>He feared this type of formation the least, especially since none of the spirit formations and restrictions in the passage were complete.</p><p>Unifying his mind with the Skyeye Butterfly and utilizing its power, Qin Sang easily identified the flaws in the illusion formation. With the Golden Sinking Sword and the Snow-Treading Divine Saber working together, he carved a path, breaking free from the illusion formation. His vision instantly brightened, transitioning from darkness to daylight.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, for he had descended into an unfamiliar sea of mist. The white mist stretched endlessly, the only constant being the ubiquitous chaotic currents.</p><p>The scene before him reminded Qin Sang of the common practice among cultivation sects – using white mist to seal their mountains, isolating themselves from the mundane world.</p><p>"If this is a mountain-sealing mist, then the Boundless Immortal Sect's mountain gate might be close..."</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted, and he increased his speed, expertly handling various unforeseen circumstances, navigating through dangers with remarkable ease.</p><p>However, after flying for a while, he suddenly slowed down, gazing at what lay ahead with astonishment.</p><p>An unusual silhouette emerged from the depths of the mist.</p><p>A long, slender white form lay horizontally, extending to both sides, its ends unseen.</p><p>The white form remained motionless, unclear whether it was animate or inanimate.</p><p>With caution, Qin Sang approached. As he drew closer, aided by the Skyeye Butterfly's divine ability, he finally discerned that the white form was a dragon sculpted from clouds and mist!</p><p>The condensed clouds and mist, serving as spiritual material, formed a tangible cloud dragon. Its scales and claws were lifelike, as if a celestial dragon lay prostrate before him, its presence majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p>There was not just one cloud dragon, but two.</p><p>The two dragons faced each other, their bodies winding towards both sides, their tails lost in the distance.</p><p>Between their heads lay a plaza of cloud qi, where numerous stone pillars stood erect.</p><p>The stone pillars were thick, capable of accommodating over a hundred people, resembling arenas.</p><p>Their original purpose was unknown, but now they were all damaged and uneven, some reduced to mere bases.</p><p>Only one remained relatively intact.</p><p>"Someone's there!"</p><p>Having clearly seen the scene around the stone pillars, Qin Sang's expression grew serious. He had finally caught up!</p><p>Silhouettes flickered around the stone pillars.</p><p>These individuals stood or sat.</p><p>Between the dragon heads, the chaotic currents were significantly fewer, a rare area of calm within the passage.</p><p>Most were seizing the opportunity to meditate and recover, but a few were surrounding the best-preserved stone pillar, constantly attacking it, causing flashes of light.</p><p>It seemed that the area between the two cloud dragons was the entrance to the mountain gate.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the cloud dragons, not detecting any barrier on them, but he wouldn't risk testing it himself. It was best to enter through the cloud qi plaza between the dragon heads.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the area between the dragon heads, identifying the attire of the group.</p><p>"They seem to be from the Eight Sceneries View and Mount Taiyue Sect.  The remnants of the Boundless Immortal Sect have already entered. Zi Lei Zhenren and Yue Lingtian aren't here either, only these people are resting..."</p><p>Qin Sang paused in the distance, noticing the lack of Grand Cultivators among the group. As he continued to approach, he saw that a spiritual herb was growing on the stone pillar they were attacking.</p><p>The spiritual herb grew in the crevices of the stone pillar, twisted and contorted, resembling a wild weed to the untrained eye.</p><p>"Azure Cloud Grass!"</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly startled.</p><p>The spiritual herb bore no flowers or fruit. Its leaves were azure blue, slightly curled, with intricate patterns.  It was a rare spiritual herb from Qin Sang's memory, highly valuable to cultivators practicing specific divine abilities!</p><p>The stem of the Azure Cloud Grass was a crimson purple, a sign of its age and superior quality, its efficacy surpassing other Azure Cloud Grasses by a significant margin.</p><p>Judging by its location, it didn't appear to be planted intentionally. It had likely grown naturally during the years of the Boundless Immortal Sect's dormancy, nurtured by the abundant spiritual energy, coincidentally sprouting on the stone pillar and protected by its restrictions.</p><p>Zhu Wudao and Zi Lei Zhenren had noticed the Azure Cloud Grass but hadn't wasted time on it.</p><p>These cultivators intended to harvest the Azure Cloud Grass during their rest.</p><p>Discovering a Heaven and Earth Treasure level spiritual herb before even entering was unexpected for Qin Sang.</p><p>The Boundless Immortal Sect was indeed an untapped treasure trove. Even without considering the Southern Sea Immortal Palace behind it, this journey was already worthwhile!</p><p>The Azure Cloud Grass wasn't particularly useful to Qin Sang. He withdrew his gaze, pondering how to bypass this group.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly recalled something. When the passage opened, another shadowy figure had entered before him. Where had that person gone?</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's expression darkened. He instructed the Skyeye Butterfly to carefully scan the area. It didn't find the person around the cloud qi plaza. But as Qin Sang discreetly moved, expanding the search area, he finally made a discovery!</p><p>A wisp of black smoke faintly lingered within the cloud sea, outside the cloud qi plaza.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to focus his vision to discern the true nature of the black smoke, he suddenly sensed something amiss.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the person within the black smoke was Old Devil Fan.</p><p>Having tracked them to this point, Old Devil Fan hadn't rushed in.  The Azure Cloud Grass was beneficial to his cultivation of a particular divine ability, something he had sought for many years.</p><p>Two fists were no match for four hands. Even with Zi Lei Zhenren absent, Old Devil Fan dared not confront the two sects' experts alone.  He had chosen to lie in wait, planning to snatch the Azure Cloud Grass.</p><p>To this end, Old Devil Fan had secretly laid out his plan in the surrounding area.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before he could put his meticulously crafted plan into action, Qin Sang stumbled upon him.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered Old Devil Fan at the same time Old Devil Fan became aware of Qin Sang.</p><p>The stone pillar's restrictions were about to crumble.</p><p>Old Devil Fan was decisive.</p><p>A bird in the hand was worth two in the bush.  It was better to secure the Azure Cloud Grass than to painstakingly scheme for treasures within.</p><p>Sensing another's arrival, he changed his plan without hesitation, launching a sneak attack to force Qin Sang's exposure. He would then take advantage of the two sects' distraction to rush into the cloud qi plaza, seize the spiritual herb, and escape!</p><p>Qin Sang's main body and avatar were connected in mind and spirit.</p><p>As his main body sensed the anomaly, his avatar, without hesitation, unleashed its divine ability. Its pupils turned deathly white, and a visible beam of icy light, carrying intense chilling煞 energy, shot downwards.</p><p>The newly refined Ice Soul Divine Light was used against an enemy for the first time.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Before the icy light arrived, the extreme cold began to spread.</p><p>The void distorted, revealing three points of dim light that flashed towards Qin Sang's main body and avatar.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light, converging inwards, arrived first, instantly freezing the surrounding space.</p><p>Several cracking sounds echoed as a few black nails materialized within the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>The nails were slender, only the length of an adult's thumb.  Their movement was silent and詭異, difficult to detect.</p><p>Now, all three black nails were enveloped by the Ice Soul Divine Light.  Their tips trembled slightly as frost spread, completely freezing them.</p><p>Cracks then appeared on the nails, shattering them on the spot.</p><p>Old Devil Fan was utterly astonished, completely taken aback by this outcome.</p><p>These black nails were called Yin Devil Nails. Each nail was imbued with a Yin Devil.  Once they struck an enemy, they would inflict unbearable torment.  They were a renowned demonic treasure of the Skyhowl Tower, feared by all.</p><p>He had deployed three at once, yet they were instantly destroyed!</p><p>But what surprised Old Devil Fan even more was that his position had been exposed so quickly!</p><p>Qin Sang instantly guessed his opponent's intentions and showed no mercy. He commanded his avatar to block the black nails while his main body flicked its sleeve, sending streams of black flames – Nine Nether Devil Fire – shooting out.</p><p>He hadn't used all of his devil fire; this amount was sufficient!</p><p>The devil fire didn't target Old Devil Fan directly but instead aimed at other locations.</p><p>This place was still within the Boundless Immortal Sect's passage, as chaotic as the outside, with only the cloud qi plaza offering some semblance of peace.</p><p>Qin Sang's targets were the fragments of restrictions and spirit formations surrounding Old Devil Fan's hiding place.</p><p>A cracked stone tablet.</p><p>A river of crimson lava.</p><p>…</p><p>Various restriction fragments formed strange phenomena, incredibly conspicuous.</p><p>Seeing this, Old Devil Fan knew things were bad.  He quickly retrieved a yellow copper bowl.  With a 'clang,' the bowl emitted ripples of yellow light, enveloping him.</p><p>Old Devil Fan darted outwards.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Nine Nether Devil Fire activated the ancient restrictions.</p><p>In an instant, Old Devil Fan's surroundings became a dazzling display of colors.</p><p>For him, this wasn't the biggest problem.</p><p>To make matters worse, Qin Sang's vision surpassed everyone else's. He had anticipated the trajectories of the chaotic currents and the paths of several flying swords, carefully calculating the order in which the restrictions would be triggered.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Explosions resounded as Old Devil Fan, along with his copper bowl, was engulfed, cursing furiously, "Damn it!"</p><p>The commotion of their clash alerted the cultivators in the cloud qi plaza.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>The cultivators of the two sects shouted, ceasing their meditation and rushing out to investigate.</p><p>Just then, they heard a sharp whooshing sound from behind.  Before they could react, a bolt of lightning tore through the clouds and mist, crossed the cloud qi plaza, and entered the Boundless Immortal Sect!</p>
