<h1>Chapter 650: A Sudden Change!</h1><p>Chapter 650: A Sudden Change!</p><p>Manager Bai informed Qin Sang of three more locations where spirit insects were rumored to be found.  This was newly acquired information, but the locations were far away, and their accuracy wasn't guaranteed.</p><p>While all three insects were unique, some were unsuitable due to their innate abilities, and for others, the cultivation methods were unknown, making the Sky Eye Butterfly a better choice for a soul insect.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>Seeing this, Manager Bai said, "There's one more place where such spirit insects might exist: the secluded, powerful sects beyond the Western Frontier. They might keep some as pets."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "Would they sell them?"</p><p>Manager Bai shook his head, "I doubt it! The rankings on the Witch Insect List are only really relevant to small sects and independent cultivators; they don't mean much to large sects and powerful factions. These spirit insects are useless to us and independent cultivators; we don't know how to cultivate them, and even reaching the second transformation is difficult. However, some large sects possess the complete cultivation methods for certain spirit insects – closely guarded secrets, the very foundation of their power – and they wouldn't easily sell them to outsiders."</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this. The major Witch clans were indeed formidable, possessing profound knowledge of insect control, with each major sect rivaling the Spirit Control Sect.</p><p>Without the Crimson Fire Gilded and the Spirit Control Sect's heritage, Qin Sang wouldn't dare aspire to more, only able to follow the current and choose a spirit insect from the top of the Witch Insect List.</p><p>After bidding farewell to Manager Bai, Qin Sang visited several trading houses before leaving Baizu Village that evening.</p><p>The newly acquired information was unsatisfactory. Qin Sang now leaned towards choosing the Sky Eye Butterfly as his soul insect.</p><p>After traveling a distance from Baizu Village, Qin Sang no longer concealed his movements, using his sword to fly back towards the Xiong Mountain region.</p><p>He traveled day and night without delay.</p><p>Just as he was about to enter the Xiong Mountain region, Qin Sang abruptly halted his sword flight, raised his right hand, and took an item from his Qianjun Ring. Upon seeing its change, his expression shifted slightly.</p><p>A Green Peng coin mother lay in his palm.</p><p>The mother coin, usually empty due to the lack of a child coin, now held one.</p><p>A child coin had suddenly appeared inside the mother coin as he arrived.</p><p>The child coin had returned!</p><p>After teleporting, Qin Sang had only given one child coin to Ya Gu.</p><p>Ya Gu had crushed the Green Peng child coin!</p><p>Qin Sang held the Green Peng coin, looked towards the Five Insects Sect, his eyes shifting uncertainly.</p><p>Ya Gu had asked him not to take back the Green Peng coin that day because it was the first gift he had given her, and she wanted to keep it as a memento.</p><p>Qin Sang understood her feelings and knew she wouldn't easily crush the coin unless something extraordinary happened.</p><p>What danger could Ya Gu have faced at the Five Insects Sect?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe Cui Xuanzi would dare harm Ya Gu.  This person was clever; even if Ya Gu's Cold Gold Sword and Devour Essence Cone were exposed, it wouldn't be worth the risk of offending a Foundation Establishment cultivator to kill her and steal her treasures.</p><p>The question was, when did Ya Gu crush the coin?</p><p>The Green Peng coins could only sense each other within a certain range.</p><p>After leaving the Xiong Mountain region, Qin Sang had left the sensing range. Only when he returned, as now, would the child coin sense the mother coin and return!</p><p>He hadn't even entered the Xiong Mountain region yet; he was at the limit of the sensing range. This meant Ya Gu hadn't crushed the coin just now—it was likely much later!</p><p>The Green Peng coin couldn't transmit messages; Qin Sang didn't know what had happened to Ya Gu.</p><p>However, when a Green Peng coin was crushed, the person who crushed it would leave behind a trace of their blood essence. Through the mother coin, one could vaguely sense their general location.</p><p>But Qin Sang was surprised to find the location indicated by the Green Peng coin was east of his current position, downstream of the Green Robe River.</p><p>The Five Insects Sect was to his north, upstream.</p><p>Why had Ya Gu left the Five Insects Sect?</p><p>Ya Gu had only been a member of the Five Insects Sect for half a year.</p><p>Qin Sang had given Ya Gu some auxiliary cultivation pills and the Winged Viper Village Priest's belongings – far more cultivation resources than Qin Sang had when he was her age.</p><p>However, her talent wasn't outstanding.</p><p>In such a short time, Qin Sang estimated she might have reached the peak of the third layer of Qi Refinement at best; the fourth layer was a hurdle that couldn't be overcome simply with pills.</p><p>At the third layer of Qi Refinement, even in the relatively safe Xiong Mountain region, dangers lurked everywhere. Yet Ya Gu leaving the Five Insects Sect at this time was very intriguing.</p><p>Qin Sang gripped the Green Peng coin tightly, casting a cold look towards the Five Insects Sect. Knowing he had to save her, he immediately turned his sword, sparing no spiritual energy or pills; he used the Sword Qi Thunder Sound and Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman to travel at maximum speed.</p><p>Ya Gu had done him a kindness, and now she was in trouble. He had to save her, hoping he wasn't too late.  Furthermore, Ya Gu's sudden departure from the Wu Chong Sect certainly had a reason. If Cui Xuanzi harbored some ulterior motive, finding Ya Gu was the only way to find out the truth.</p><p>His sword energy and thunderous sound, his escape techniques were astonishing.</p><p>A brilliant sword light split the sky, as radiant as a meteor, its immense power sweeping across all directions without restraint.  Countless birds and beasts fled in terror along its path.  Ordinary people, hearing the thunderclap in the clear sky and witnessing the dazzling sword light, fell to their knees, crying out to the gods.</p><p>The magic coin could only pinpoint a general location. Qin Sang vaguely sensed that Ya Gu was moving.</p><p>Passing a large encampment, Qin Sang's heart stirred.  He swept his spiritual sense downwards, discovering an old priest at the Foundation Establishment stage within.  He then directly used his true essence to form a hand, grabbing the old priest out of his cave dwelling.</p><p>"Aaah..."</p><p>The old priest screamed in terror. He had been peacefully cultivating in his cave when the prohibition was brutally shattered. Before he could react, a large hand formed from true essence snatched him out, like a chick, leaving him utterly defenseless.</p><p>Qin Sang was desperate to save Ya Gu, so even after grabbing the priest, his speed didn't falter.  He flew across several mountain ranges in the blink of an eye.</p><p>"I ask you, what has happened recently in the Xiong Shan region?"</p><p>Qin Sang held the old priest aloft, his gaze icy as he interrogated him.</p><p>The old priest, sensing the terrifying pressure emanating from Qin Sang, was greatly frightened. However, being an old hand, he saw that Qin Sang had no intention of killing him, and quickly steadied himself.  He trembled, "Four months ago, the Wu Chong Sect suddenly gained a new Gold Core stage expert, who subdued the surrounding areas.  Under the guise of this Gold Core cultivator, they forced us to search for hidden realms within a thousand li radius. Other than that, nothing significant happened."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly. "Has there been any unusual activity at the Wu Chong Sect in the past few days?"</p><p>"I don't know what you mean, senior. As far as I know... nothing, it seems."</p><p>The old priest cautiously watched Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang asked the old priest a few more questions, but seeing he truly knew nothing, casually tossed him away.</p><p>The old priest, having escaped death, was pale, muttering incessantly, "Trouble… trouble…  The Xiong Shan region is going to be in great chaos! I'd better leave…"</p><p>Leaving the old priest behind, Qin Sang's speed didn't lessen.  Before long, Qin Sang finally saw the Qingyi River and the Qianhu Village not far ahead. The magic coin indicated that Ya Gu was even further downstream.</p>
