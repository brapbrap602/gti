<h1>Chapter 1266: Lone Battle</h1><p>Chapter 1266: Lone Battle</p><p>Ye Laomo was determined to have his way.</p><p>Qing Jun knew further words were futile.  She suddenly released the Five-Faced Pagoda, sending it soaring towards Ye Laomo!</p><p>However, a phantom of the pagoda, faster than the real thing, appeared above the prison cage.</p><p>Ye Laomo glanced at the diligently exhaling white shadows, his black robe billowing as he uttered several unintelligible syllables. The phantom of the Five-Faced Pagoda seemed to encounter immense resistance, unable to descend.</p><p>Those white shadows remained unmoving, their eyes fixed on the cage.</p><p>Simultaneously, Ye Laomo's body, about to be suppressed by the Five-Faced Pagoda, suddenly vanished, reappearing three meters away, effortlessly escaping the pagoda's pressure.</p><p>Before him, two beams of light, one black and one white, materialized.</p><p>These were two short halberds.</p><p>The halberds themselves were one black, one white – his life-bound treasures: the Yin-Yang Halberds!</p><p>The Yin-Yang Halberds shot out, transforming into two dragons.</p><p>The white, the Yang Halberd, possessed unparalleled power, unstoppable.</p><p>The black, the Yin Halberd, moved silently, cunning and venomous.</p><p>The white dragon, claws outstretched, lunged at the Five-Faced Pagoda.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>Two supreme treasures clashed without flourish, striking each other with brutal force.</p><p>The Five-Faced Pagoda, originally aiming for Ye Laomo, was hit by the Yang Halberd, directly on the central 'square' character.</p><p>However, the Yang Halberd didn't break the pagoda's protective light, nor did it strike its core. The Five-Faced Pagoda tilted slightly, pausing, its body unharmed.</p><p>The Yang Halberd failed to gain the upper hand, even recoiling. Immediately, it reformed into a white dragon, fiercely entangling the pagoda again.</p><p>Dragon shadows encircled the Five-Faced Pagoda; the two treasures were momentarily locked in a stalemate.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Ye Laomo was surprised.</p><p>The Five-Faced Pagoda was not inferior to his Yin-Yang Halberds.  Even more remarkable, it wasn't anyone's life-bound treasure, making it suitable as a sect's heirloom.</p><p>However, no matter how high the quality of a treasure, its power depends on the wielder's skill.</p><p>The Yuan Shen sect master before him had always been quite low-key, achieving some renown in previous battles, but still not someone Ye Laomo took seriously.</p><p>Ye Laomo had only used the Yang Halberd against the Five-Faced Pagoda, expecting to easily hold it off even if slightly outmatched. This situation was unexpected.</p><p>Ye Laomo stared intently at Qing Jun, increasingly astonished.</p><p>He found himself unable to fully gauge this person!</p><p>While "number one in Bei Chen" was mere flattery, Ye Laomo had the confidence to deserve the title.</p><p>Yet, someone was unreadable to him.</p><p>The Five-Faced Pagoda's performance proved that he and Tian Zheng had underestimated her, whether she had been deliberately concealing her abilities or had recently made a breakthrough.</p><p>As Ye Laomo assessed Qing Jun, the Yin Halberd vanished, reappearing before Qing Jun, aiming directly for her face.</p><p>The Yin Halberd remained silent, like a black dragon moving in shadows.</p><p>Qing Jun, feeling a stinging pain where the halberd targeted her brow, felt an intense warning, silently chanting an incantation. A green light shot out from her sleeve.</p><p>A sudden phoenix cry echoed.</p><p>The green light expanded in the wind, transforming into a Qingluan (Azure Bird).</p><p>The Qingluan appeared vibrant and different than before.</p><p>After obtaining Qingluan’s blood, Qin Sang had shown Qing Jun the true spirit of the Qingluan, allowing Qing Jun to improve her Qingluan puppet, enhancing its spirit to closely resemble a real Qingluan.</p><p>However, from the start, Qing Jun had imbued the Qingluan with a fire-type rune, transforming it into a Firebird, making a change back to a Thunderbird impossible.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Qingluan puppet had undergone a transformation and had become even closer to Qin Sang.</p><p>After a clear cry, the Qingluan turned its head, fixing its gaze on the black dragon form of the Yin Halberd. It immediately flapped its wings, extended its claws, and pounced.</p><p>‘Peng! Peng!’</p><p>The Yin Halberd and the Qingluan instantly engaged in several exchanges, becoming entangled.</p><p>Having learned his lesson, Ye Laomo poured his energy into the Yin Halberd, gaining the upper hand, causing the Qingluan to show signs of fatigue.</p><p>Seeing this, Qing Jun produced another scroll – the River and Mountain Hidden Moon Chart she had used before.</p><p>The River and Mountain Hidden Moon Chart slowly unfurled.</p><p>Vast rivers and mountains stretched endlessly, with boundless clouds swirling, a full moon rising slowly – breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>The River and Mountain Hidden Moon Chart was also far superior now, its painted world flawless, seemingly real.</p><p>The treasure unrolled, encircling Qing Jun, forming a protective barrier.</p><p>Only the full moon ascended, flying out from the painted world, hanging above the two.</p><p>Cool moonlight shone, a beam entering the Qingluan's body.</p><p>Empowered by the treasure, the Qingluan’s strength greatly increased. It cried out excitedly twice, then tightly entangled the black dragon.</p><p>Ye Laomo's plan for a swift victory was completely thwarted.</p><p>However, Qing Jun found it difficult to prevent Ye Laomo from breaking the seal.  She withdrew some of her spiritual energy from the Qingluan puppet, activating the Five-Element Pagoda to forcibly retreat from the white dragon and shatter the shadowy creature gnawing at the prison.</p><p>But Ye Laomo wouldn't give her the chance.  His hand seals changed rapidly, creating a mysterious connection between the two Yin-Yang halberds, boosting their power even further.</p><p>Just as the battle intensified, Ye Laomo sensed something and abruptly looked up.  Above, black ropes crisscrossed, obscuring the sky. His gaze seemed to pierce through the blood, towards the top of the blood pool.</p><p>Then, Ye Laomo lowered his gaze, his eyes flickering, seemingly considering something.  After a moment, he snorted coldly, suddenly forcing a few drops of his essence blood from his fingertips and flicking them into the shadowy creature.</p><p>The shadowy creature consumed the blood, instantly becoming incredibly ferocious. The prison seal was on the verge of collapse!</p><p>...</p><p>Outside the blood pool.</p><p>Qin Sang gasped for breath, frowning at the blood demon before him. He had retracted his demonic flames; the sword energy and lightning around him had just dissipated, showing that he had used lightning and sword escapes.</p><p>A moment ago, Qin Sang had used the demonic flames to intimidate the blood demon, hoping to catch it off guard and use his superior escape techniques to forcibly break through its blockade and enter the blood pool, but he had been stopped.</p><p>Qing Jun and Jing Yu had been down there for a long time, yet there was little movement from the blood pool.  Not only was the Zuanyuan side anxious, but Qin Sang was also worried that Qing Jun and Jing Yu might not be a match for Ye Laomo.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the other two battlefields.</p><p>At the blood pool entrance.</p><p>Two large arrays intertwined, each within the other.  The arrays were interconnected; everyone was affected by them.  It was the most intense moment; under these circumstances, those within the arrays dared not easily withdraw, lest they trigger a chain reaction and be exploited by their opponent.</p><p>As for Tongyou Mojun and Tianzheng Laoren, it was unclear when they would reach a conclusion.</p><p>Initially, Tongyou Mojun was just an insignificant shadow in the starry river.</p><p>Now, the shadow had engulfed half the starry river, with howling gales assaulting the remaining stars.  Tianzheng Laoren had been forced to break through the Star River Record, suffering some depletion of his energy. Tongyou Mojun’s demonic power had greatly increased, putting him at an advantage—victory was only a matter of time.</p><p>But time was precisely the most precious thing!</p><p>Even though Tianzheng Laoren was injured, delaying Tongyou Mojun for a while was certainly not difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  It seemed the breakthrough could only come from his side.</p>
