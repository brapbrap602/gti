<h1>Chapter 1354: The Efficacy of the Corpse Flower Blood Amber</h1><p>Chapter 1354: The Efficacy of the Corpse Flower Blood Amber</p><p>After entering Xuanlu Pass, the Yuan Ying cultivators observed for another month.</p><p>As they expected, the hurricanes and spiritual tides in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield showed no signs of abating, transforming into a storm belt.</p><p>Fortunately, </p><p>whether due to the lingering power of the Ziwei Palace or other unknown reasons, the storms in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield were much weaker than other storm belts, with fluctuating intensity.</p><p>The various factions of the Beichen Realm cooperated to defend the pass, and the pressure was less than expected.</p><p>During periods of low tide, lower-level cultivators, if bold enough and well-prepared, could venture outside the pass to seek opportunities in the outer regions of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>However, it was impossible to delve as deep as before.</p><p>In comparison, the Yuanxu Abyss suffered more severe damage, and even Yuan Ying cultivators dared not enter.</p><p>The Wuyaya Valley did not escape unscathed.</p><p>Fortunately, only the inner valley was destroyed; the outer valley, though impacted, partially survived.  Jingyu's cave abode and the Blood Lake vanished, leaving him to settle in the Qianshan Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, establishing the Beichen Alliance encountered almost no resistance.</p><p>Given the circumstances, Xiaohan Territory no longer dared to harbor ambitions of monopolizing the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, willingly relinquishing its interests in the Qixiong Pass.</p><p>Tianyao Hill, Xiaohan Territory, Tianxing Alliance, Zuibian, and the Beichen Great Desert—five major regions—rarely formed a defensive alliance, guarding a common secret.</p><p>As the saying goes, after a long period of division, there will inevitably be unity.</p><p>Thanks to the Beichen Alliance, the Beichen Realm's cultivation world enjoyed a long period of peace.</p><p>"The enduring spiritual tides have both advantages and disadvantages. Some deeply hidden ancient restrictions might be activated by the tides, reappearing in the world. Perhaps there are celestial palaces comparable to the Ziwei Palace, with access platforms…"</p><p>In a small courtyard, Qin Sang, Bing Han, and several other Yuan Ying cultivators sipped tea and discussed matters.</p><p>They occasionally looked up at the sky; the spiritual tides constantly bombarded the barrier, causing it to flicker incessantly.</p><p>Xiang Qing spoke.</p><p>A rising star with a promising future, he placed great importance on the access platforms.</p><p>In the future, the Yuan Ying cultivators of the Beichen Alliance would frequently explore the Ancient Immortal Battlefield together, searching for opportunities.</p><p>Bing Han's expression shifted slightly upon hearing this. She said, "Cultivation is already difficult for cultivators today. Now, the largest treasures of the Beichen Realm—the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the Yuanxu Abyss, and the Wuyaya Valley—have all been affected, making it even harder for disciples to seek opportunities. In my opinion, the Beichen Alliance should add another rule: Yuan Ying cultivators should not excessively plunder the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, leaving a path for future generations."</p><p>"That's reasonable. Most treasures are useless to us…"</p><p>The group exchanged comments.</p><p>After drinking a pot of tea, Qin Sang rose to take his leave.</p><p>"Where is Daoist Friend Qin heading?"</p><p>"To collect the souls of the cloud beasts."</p><p>Qin Sang replied, flying out of Xuanlu Pass.</p><p>He had re-refined a batch of Beast King Banners, and together with those seized from the Wu Clan's Golden Core cultivators, he had gathered eighty-one banners.  With minor adjustments, he could collect the cloud beast souls.</p><p>The cloud beasts of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield were special creatures that appeared intermittently due to the spiritual tides. Now that the tides were incessant, cloud beasts would become increasingly rare.</p><p>The following decade.</p><p>With the establishment of the Beichen Alliance, communication between the various regions' cultivation worlds became unimpeded, and mutual animosity gradually dissipated.</p><p>No single entity could command the allegiance of all.</p><p>The Beichen Alliance had no leader but an Elder Council that jointly decided on major affairs, balancing the interests of all parties; Qin Sang was a member.</p><p>After attending to the matters of the Beichen Alliance, Qin Sang began preparations for establishing his own sect.</p><p>And today, the grand ceremony is imminent!</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the events of the past ten years, gradually calming his thoughts.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The Qianjun Ring flashed, releasing two items.</p><p>One was the eighty-one Beast King Banners; the other was a cushion-shaped treasure.</p><p>The cushion was another treasure Qin Sang prepared for the Qingyang Sect—the Heartlight Cushion.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the material of the Heartlight Cushion was not of plant origin; it emitted a faint blue light, seeming to be made from a type of crystal.</p><p>Its main material was a rare spiritual object called Illusory Light Crystal, obtained by Qin Sang in exchange from a Yuan Ying cultivator in the desert.</p><p>The Yuan Ying puppet's ability to seal soul shadows was due to the Evolutionary Dao Tree.</p><p>Bai later provided Qin Sang with an idea, which, after careful consideration and several attempts, allowed him to refine the Heartlight Cushion using Illusory Light Crystal, achieving a similar effect of sealing soul shadows.</p><p>However, the Heartlight Cushion was far inferior to the Yuan Ying puppet.</p><p>First, the Heartlight Cushion could not autonomously devour soul shadows; Qin Sang had to transfer them from the Yuan Ying puppet.</p><p>Second, the number of soul shadows that the Heartlight Cushion could seal was limited, and they would weaken over time until they completely dissipated, unlike the Yuan Ying puppet which could exist for a long time. Qin Sang had no better solution.</p><p>This proved that the Evolutionary Dao Tree truly had an extraordinary origin, impossible to replicate.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang had already transferred two nascent soul-stage spirit shadows into the Heartlight Cushion.</p><p>He activated his divine sense to probe the cushion. The spirit shadows were stable; adding one more would be the limit.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>A blood-red, teardrop-shaped mark adorned the puppet's forehead—a mark Bai had given Qin Sang to mask the fluctuations of the Yandao Tree, preventing others from discerning the puppet's material.</p><p>Even though it was immature and tainted, the Yandao Tree was a rare treasure. Caution was necessary.</p><p>Qin Sang set aside the Beast King Banner and guided a spirit shadow from within the Nascent Soul puppet, merging it into the Heartlight Cushion.</p><p>The Heartlight Cushion trembled slightly before returning to stillness.</p><p>“Creak!”</p><p>Qin Sang pushed open the door, spotted Jing Yu, and quickly flew into the gazebo.</p><p>The white cat wisely retreated.</p><p>“I apologize for keeping you waiting,”</p><p>Qin Sang said apologetically.</p><p>Jing Yu looked Qin Sang up and down.  “Your cultivation has improved significantly during this retreat. It seems you’ve refined a Corpse Flower Amber?”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He produced a pot of peach blossom wine, pouring a cup for Jing Yu and himself.  His senior sister's peach blossom wine was nearly gone; he only brought it out for esteemed guests.</p><p>“I must also thank you for the secret technique to purify the Corpse Flower Amber. After removing the blood poison, we cultivators can directly refine it. The process was remarkably smooth, and the improvement to my cultivation far exceeded my expectations!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyebrows flew up, his voice filled with delight.  “If all goes well, after refining these three Corpse Flower Ambers, I should be able to reach the mid-Nascent Soul stage!”</p><p>Jing Yu, well-aware of the Corpse Flower Amber's effects, wasn’t surprised. She smiled gently, raising her cup. “Then I wish you an early breakthrough to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, shocking the world!”</p><p>A breakthrough to the mid-Nascent Soul stage within a hundred years of forming the Nascent Soul was extremely rare throughout history, a feat worthy of a peerless genius!</p><p>Qin Sang thanked her, raising his cup in return, without any false modesty.</p><p>He felt no self-satisfaction.</p><p>The three Corpse Flower Ambers, along with the Yandao Tree spirit shadow's assistance, made a mid-Nascent Soul breakthrough possible.  Without them, he had no idea how long it would have taken.</p><p>The two put down their cups and began to discuss other matters.</p><p>Just then,</p><p>the white cat returned. “Tan Yi'en sent an urgent message, saying that a former acquaintance of the master has come to visit and is waiting at the mountain gate.”</p>
