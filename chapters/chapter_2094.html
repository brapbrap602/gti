<h1>Chapter 2085: The Three Sects' Plot</h1><p>Zhongzhou.</p><p>The former location of the Formless Immortal Sect now served as the headquarters of the Three Sects Alliance.</p><p>The founders of the Three Sects Alliance—the Eight Sceneries View, the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, and the Heavenly Hao Tower—were the leading forces of the Dao, Buddhist, and Demonic sects respectively, and the overlords of Zhongzhou.  After their alliance, other powers could only submit to their will.</p><p>Back then, after Qin Sang reached Nascent Soul, he was the sole Nascent Soul cultivator in the Storm Realm.  He certainly had the power to dismantle the Three Sects Alliance and suppress the three major sects. However, at the time, the Azure Ram View in Zhongzhou was newly established, and he had no interest in dominating the world.</p><p>More importantly, there was no path to ascension then. He needed to unite all forces to find a way out for the Storm Realm. The Three Sects Alliance would not be an obstacle; on the contrary, it could better cooperate with him and consolidate everyone's strength.</p><p>After Qin Sang's disappearance, the Three Sects Alliance lost its checks and balances. When the Storm Realm first ascended, all three major sects suffered losses, with experts falling to the Heavenly Tribulation. However, the other sects in Zhongzhou were similarly affected, so they were still unable to shake the Three Sects Alliance's position.</p><p>With the emergence of Liu Li and the discovery of the formidable enemy, the Long Right Tribe, the Storm Realm was in a precarious situation.  There was no energy to target the Three Sects Alliance, and their support was even needed, leading to a reluctant tolerance.</p><p>As time passed, Nascent Soul cultivators gradually appeared within the Three Sects Alliance, and it steadily became an unwieldy behemoth.  The powers in Zhongzhou had to heed their every whim, and Liu Li could no longer command them.</p><p>Unfortunately, Zhongzhou held the strongest human force.</p><p>Perhaps because Liu Li held the moral high ground, possessing unparalleled cultivation and prestige, or perhaps because the Three Sects Alliance believed that humanity's situation had not improved and preferred to have Liu Li bear the brunt of the storm while they remained behind the scenes, they had not yet openly opposed her.</p><p>Any discerning eye could see that once the Three Sects Alliance produced one or even two late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators, they would inevitably attempt to seize power.</p><p>Regrettably, humanity was currently slightly weaker than the妖族.  The three sect leaders showed no signs of breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage.  If nothing unexpected happened, they would be suppressed by the妖族 and would still have to rely on Liu Li to confront external threats.</p><p>The Dao, Buddhist, and Demonic cultivation philosophies differed. Under normal circumstances, harmony between them was impossible. Conflict would inevitably erupt one day, ultimately leading to their disintegration.</p><p>However, external crises repeatedly forced the Three Sects Alliance to unite against external enemies, venting internal conflicts outwards and strengthening the bonds between the three major sects.</p><p>At this moment, the three sect leaders gathered at the Three Sects Alliance headquarters.</p><p>Outside, the night was deep. Moonlight shone into the headquarters, casting shadows of palaces and pavilions, creating an unusually serene atmosphere. Within one of the ancient halls, lights blazed, illuminating its gilded splendor.</p><p>Three figures sat high within the hall. One of them was He Gao Zhenjun, the current master of the Eight Sceneries View.</p><p>Opposite He Gao Zhenjun sat a young man in a black robe. He had a thin face, an effeminate air, and strikingly white hair and eyebrows. This was Ku Rong Lao Mo, whom Qin Sang had once encountered.</p><p>After the death of the Heavenly Hao Tower's sect leader, Ku Rong Lao Mo had taken over, living up to expectations. Not only had his own cultivation progressed rapidly, but he had also led the Heavenly Hao Tower to flourish.</p><p>Sitting between He Gao Zhenjun and Ku Rong Lao Mo was an old monk, also an acquaintance of Qin Sang—Master Xing Ren, now respectfully addressed as Saint Xing Ren.</p><p>Saint Xing Ren was the senior brother of the previous abbot of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, Master Xing Ji. After Master Xing Ji's death, he had taken on the mantle of leadership.</p><p>Among the three, Saint Xing Ren was the most senior. In terms of cultivation, however, the youngest, Ku Rong Lao Mo, possessed the greatest talent and held a slight edge.</p><p>"Ku Rong Lao Mo, you insisted on summoning this poor Daoist and Saint Xing Ren. What important matter do you have?" He Gao Zhenjun looked at Ku Rong Lao Mo and went straight to the point.</p><p>Over the centuries, the Three Sects Alliance had established comprehensive rules and regulations, with experts permanently stationed at the headquarters.  Ordinarily, the presence of the three sect leaders was unnecessary. Moreover, the three needed to focus on their cultivation, striving to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage as soon as possible, so gatherings like this were rare.</p><p>Ku Rong Lao Mo gently waved his hand, activating the hall's formation barrier and then specifically setting up a Dao-sealing restriction.</p><p>This was the Three Sects Alliance headquarters. His cautious actions caused both He Gao Zhenjun and Master Xing Ji's eyes to narrow slightly.</p><p>"That Sect Leader Li seems determined to re-establish his sect, regardless of the consequences."</p><p>Ku Rong Lao Mo spoke slowly.</p><p>He Gao Zhenjun frowned slightly. "This was already confirmed! This poor Daoist personally visited him to ascertain the matter. The Azure Ram View has clearly been planning this for a long time and is unlikely to give up due to external doubts."</p><p>"Then, Zhenjun, do you believe that the words of the Flood Dragon King and the Golden Toad King at the Three Races Council were merely threats intended to deter the Azure Ram View?" Ku Rong Lao Mo looked at He Gao Zhenjun and chuckled darkly.</p><p>Saint Xing Ren's expression shifted slightly, and he chanted a Buddhist mantra.  "Fellow Daoist, do you know something? There are no outsiders here. You may speak plainly."</p><p>Ku Rong Lao Mo spread his hands. "I have no concrete evidence, but this is not mere speculation.  We all know the Flood Dragon King's temperament. This demon fancies himself a descendant of true dragons, with noble blood and an arrogant demeanor.  His words should never be taken as simple threats.  And that Dragon Whale, never one to act without benefit, spoke in support of the Flood Dragon King at the Three Races Council. They must have already reached a secret agreement."</p><p>He Gao Zhenjun pondered. "Are you saying that the Flood Dragon King might be plotting to reclaim the Demon Sea?"</p><p>"The Azure Ram View has set a fine precedent!"  Ku Rong Lao Mo sneered.  "The Demon Sea is not only their ancestral land, but it's also close to the Tainted Lands, making it more advantageous for competing for Azure Spiritual Qi. Once the Flood Dragon King and the Great Saint Dragon Whale both break through, even disregarding the human race and the Wu Clan, the妖族 will have the strength to reclaim the Demon Sea!"</p><p>Saint Xing Ren and He Gao Zhenjun fell silent, understanding that this was a very real possibility.</p><p>"This matter is difficult to prevent."</p><p>Saint Xing Ren sighed.</p><p>By then, with the妖族's strength growing, humanity would need to guard against their suppression.  How could they proactively provoke them?</p><p>He Gao Zhenjun nodded slightly and mused, "However, reclaiming the Demon Sea won't be easy. The Long Right Tribe will never give up easily unless the Flood Dragon King is willing to pay a heavy price."</p><p>Humanity was unable to stop it, but they couldn't be dragged into it either. The Dragon Whale Great Saint might not fully support the Flood Dragon King.</p><p>"With the Flood Dragon King's cunning, he certainly won't be willing to suffer losses. So, what would be the best course of action?"</p><p>Ku Rong Lao Mo looked at the two and answered his own question, "Divert the disaster!"</p><p>By diverting the Long Right Tribe's army, the pressure of reclaiming the Demon Sea would naturally decrease.</p><p>The question was, would the Flood Dragon King target Zhongzhou or the North Sea?</p><p>Both Saint Xing Ren and He Gao Zhenjun looked grave.</p><p>Ku Rong Lao Mo continued his analysis, "That Dragon Whale, although of the妖族, is quite sensible.  I see him enjoying himself in the East Sea, unlikely to be willing to move to the Demon Sea and live under someone else's thumb. If the Flood Dragon King targets Zhongzhou, he won't agree. That leaves only the North Sea.  Fairy Liu Li is in seclusion, and the Azure Ram View is constantly transferring personnel. In the future, when the protective formation is complete, they may even invite allies to assist. The North Sea will be unprecedentedly vulnerable..."</p><p>He paused here, not needing to elaborate further.</p><p>Ku Rong Lao Mo's analysis seemed logical and reasonable.</p><p>But He Gao Zhenjun sensed something amiss. Ku Rong Lao Mo's tone was too certain, as if events would definitely unfold as he predicted.</p><p>"Have you discovered something?"</p><p>He Gao Zhenjun stared at Ku Rong Lao Mo.</p><p>Ku Rong Lao Mo neither confirmed nor denied, saying faintly, "That's not important. What's important is, if the North Sea is in danger, will the two of you save it or not? When will you save it? How will you save it?"</p><p>Three consecutive questions went straight to the heart of the matter.</p><p>There was an ancient teleportation formation between Zhongzhou and the North Sea. If they were to send full reinforcements, the troops could be dispatched quickly.</p><p>"Fairy Liu Li cannot be harmed! The North Sea cannot be lost!" Saint Xing Ren declared resolutely.</p><p>Neither Ku Rong Lao Mo nor He Gao Zhenjun objected.</p><p>The North Sea definitely needed to be saved, at least before they broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage. They still relied on Fairy Liu Li's power and could not afford to see her injured.</p><p>But when to send troops and how many to send were matters requiring careful consideration.</p><p>Of course, they could warn Fairy Liu Li and Li Yufu now, stating the gravity of the situation and urging the Azure Ram View to abandon the re-establishment of their sect, preventing the situation from worsening.</p><p>However, none of the three sect leaders suggested this option, tacitly choosing to ignore it.</p><p>"Indeed, we cannot sit idly by and watch the North Sea fall, but we can use this opportunity to let Fairy Liu Li and the Azure Ram View understand that without our support, they are simply incapable of resisting the Long Right Tribe!" Ku Rong Lao Mo's gaze swept over the two. He said in a deep voice, "Zhongzhou has always been a land of outstanding individuals, far surpassing the North Sea and other regions. It deserves a greater share of the Azure Spiritual Qi!"</p><p>Saint Xing Ren and He Gao Zhenjun exchanged glances, understanding Ku Rong Lao Mo's intentions. No one wanted mutually assured destruction, but before the "net" was broken, there was room for maneuvering.</p><p>He Gao Zhenjun hesitated. "With the alliance agreement in place, if our reinforcements are not timely and we delay the battle, it will be easy for others to criticize us.  If Fairy Liu Li uses this as a pretext to attack..."</p><p>They didn't want a complete falling out with the North Sea.</p><p>Both Saint Xing Ren and He Gao Zhenjun looked at Ku Rong Lao Mo.  The old demon had been acting confident, and must have thought of a countermeasure before inviting them.</p><p>Seeing the opportune moment, Ku Rong Lao Mo stopped beating around the bush. "Zhenjun's concerns are not unfounded, but there are countermeasures. Please look, fellow Daoists."</p><p>Saying this, Ku Rong Lao Mo took out a jade slip and placed it on the table.</p><p>Sweeping their divine senses over it and seeing its contents, both Saint Xing Ren and He Gao Zhenjun revealed surprised expressions.</p><p>"This spiritual treasure I envision combines the power of the Dao, Buddhist, and Demonic sects. Wielded by the three of us together, it will be sufficient to withstand the heavenly might of a late Nascent Soul cultivator, and even facing two might not be impossible! Once this treasure is refined, even if we haven't broken through, we won't fear any force!"  Ku Rong Lao Mo's eyes flashed with confidence, his spirit soaring.</p><p>Saint Xing Ren and He Gao Zhenjun were astonished by Ku Rong Lao Mo's ingenious idea, but they were not as optimistic, as his concept for the spiritual treasure was incomplete, merely a proposed approach.</p><p>It seemed to have considerable feasibility, but there was still a possibility of failure.</p><p>According to Ku Rong Lao Mo's vision, refining this treasure required the three of them to comprehend it together and refine it jointly.</p><p>They were all exceptionally talented individuals, their paths of cultivation not yet exhausted, with the potential to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage in the future. Whether it was worth delaying their cultivation for an uncertain treasure was questionable.</p><p>"However..."</p><p>Saint Xing Ren was about to speak but was interrupted by Ku Rong Lao Mo.</p><p>"We will use comprehending this treasure as a reason for seclusion, entrusting the sects to those below us and letting them act according to the circumstances.  If we refine this treasure, we can stand on equal footing with Fairy Liu Li.  If we fail, and Fairy Liu Li raises objections in the future, presenting this incomplete design will make it easier to explain."</p><p>Having laid out the advantages and disadvantages, Ku Rong Lao Mo stopped speaking. He believed they would make the correct decision.</p><p>The hall fell silent.  After pondering for a long time, He Gao Zhenjun was the first to express his position. Saint Xing Ren finally nodded slightly, signifying his agreement.</p><p>The three continued discussing in the hall for a long time until daybreak, before leaving the Three Sects Alliance headquarters.</p><p>...</p><p>Azure Ram View.</p><p>Jian Nu's cave dwelling was located on a mountain peak beside the main peak.  Huan Hen often visited, seeking Jian Nu's guidance on swordsmanship.</p><p>On this day, after helping Li Yufu further refine a portion of the protective formation, Huan Hen rushed back impatiently, activating the cave dwelling's restriction.</p><p>"Senior Jian Nu, it is I."</p><p>A flash of spiritual light appeared before the cave dwelling, and Jian Nu's calm voice emerged. "Enter."</p><p>With a respectful expression, Huan Hen entered the cave dwelling, bowed to Jian Nu, and voiced his confusion regarding the Dao of the Sword.</p><p>This was how they had interacted over the years.  The two sword cultivators focused only on the sword, their conversations revolving solely around it.</p><p>Jian Nu wouldn't directly answer Huan Hen's questions, but guided him to find the answers himself.</p><p>Their sword techniques differed. Huan Hen's technique stemmed from the *Purple Star Sword Canon*, while Jian Nu's technique was passed down to Tian Yue Shangren by the First Sword Attendant, representing a different swordsmanship lineage from the Purple Star Palace's Fourteen Sword Pavilions.</p><p>In the future, Qin Sang would undoubtedly refine Huan Hen's technique. Leading him astray wouldn't benefit him.</p><p>Back then, Tian Yue Shangren, under the alias Zhi Jian, had guided Qin Sang in the same manner.</p><p>Lost in thought after their conversation, Huan Hen didn't feel instantly enlightened, but the more he pondered, the more he sensed the profoundness within, his admiration for Jian Nu growing immensely.</p><p>Still having unanswered questions, he wasn't in a hurry. Regaining his composure, he said respectfully, "Reporting to Senior, I have a matter to relay on Sect Leader's orders."</p><p>Then, Huan Hen briefly described the recent situation.</p><p>Although there were no clear signs yet, based on the intelligence sent by Gui Hou and others, the North Sea was becoming increasingly dangerous.</p><p>They wanted to lure out the evildoers, but not at the cost of the North Sea's downfall.  Precautions were needed to prevent unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>Below the Void Refinement stage, Jian Nu possessed the greatest strength.  Inviting him to safeguard the North Sea was the most suitable course of action.</p><p>Upon learning of this, Jian Nu nodded slightly. "Very well.  I told you to sheathe your sword and cultivate your sword intent. It's time to draw your sword!"</p><p>Huan Hen's eyes lit up with excitement. Since joining the Azure Ram View as a child, he had consistently challenged strong opponents with his sword. Initially, he found Jian Nu's instruction to sheathe his sword unsettling, but later gradually realized its benefits.</p><p>He was certain that he had undergone a transformative change and was eager to find an opponent to test it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Jian Nu immediately poured cold water on his enthusiasm.  "The sword technique you cultivate is not my technique. Cultivating my sword-nurturing technique requires patience when drawing your sword.  Otherwise, your energy will dissipate abruptly, and all your efforts will be wasted!"</p><p>Huan Hen's expression turned serious.  "Please instruct me, Senior!"</p><p>"You can conceal your identity, seal your cultivation, and engage in battlefield combat, starting from scratch and reliving the path of sword refinement. This should allow you to achieve great success! This endeavor inevitably carries risks. Consider it carefully," Jian Nu said.</p><p>Huan Hen seemed to have a sudden realization.</p><p>The next day, Jian Nu left the Azure Ram View, accompanied by a young man.  The young man carried a sword on his back, his appearance and demeanor ordinary, attracting no attention.</p>
