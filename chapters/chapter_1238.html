<h1>Chapter 1230: Revenge</h1><p>Chapter 1230: Revenge</p><p>Pang Ji circled the ice palace and discovered a teleportation array.  He realized that Qin Sang had used it to reach his home and steal a fragment of the  "Interminable Blood Mulberry."</p><p>However, the array was inactive; the corresponding array on the other side was damaged.</p><p>Qin Sang buried Wu Shang's body in the ice palace, erected a memorial, and then sealed the palace.</p><p>After leaving the ice palace, Pang Ji wanted to visit his old lair.</p><p>The Thunder Hawk's lair was deep within the Inner Valley.</p><p>The Wuya Valley was filled with numerous restrictions and spatial distortions.  Qin Sang followed Pang Ji for a long time before they finally reached the familiar glacier and the boundless, cloud-like Xuan Frost gale.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Qin Sang passed through the Xuan Frost gale and saw the entrance to the Thunder Hawk's lair. Sensing that the lair now had an occupant, he subtly shifted his gaze to Pang Ji.</p><p>Pang Ji chuckled foolishly, "You can't hide anything from Master's keen eyes. My mother's lair was seized by a damned fox shortly after she disappeared. I was young then, and it chased me relentlessly. Luckily, my mother left me a few life-saving treasures; otherwise, I would have been killed. Afterwards, I was displaced, suffered greatly, and almost captured by cultivators who would have skinned and boned me to make a magical artifact.  I can't let this go unavenged!"</p><p>Recalling his past suffering, Pang Ji gnashed his teeth.</p><p>Although the Thunder Hawk demon king had disappeared, he had left behind a magnificent lair and numerous treasures. Pang Ji could have calmly cultivated to the Demon Core stage or even higher and then journeyed to find a way to save his mother.</p><p>Unfortunately, his lair was occupied by an uninvited guest.</p><p>The descendant of a powerful demon king became a homeless stray.</p><p>Pang Ji narrowly escaped, hiding and fleeing in a desperate situation.</p><p>"No need to bother Master, I'll settle this score myself!"</p><p>Pang Ji let out a sharp cry, diving down like a lightning bolt, directly into the ice cave. Immediately afterward, a sharp, urgent cry echoed from within the lair.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The cold wind in the ice cave dispersed, and beams of lightning and blue light erupted from the cave, radiating light in all directions.</p><p>Pang Ji charged back out of the ice cave, followed by a blue glow – a blue fox, as large as a calf, whose aura was comparable to his own.</p><p>Over the years, the blue fox, occupying such a good lair and cultivating day and night, had grown into a late-stage Demon Core demon; otherwise, Pang Ji would have sought revenge long ago.</p><p>Enemies meeting is a sight to behold.</p><p>The two demon beasts instantly clashed.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the fight; the blue fox was quite fierce and strong, but not as strong as Pang Ji, who had absorbed the power of the Azure Luan lightning and possessed the demon king's treasures.</p><p>Pang Ji's victory was only a matter of time.</p><p>Uninterested, he turned his gaze away, flying out of the gale layer to observe this remote land.</p><p>Outside the lair.</p><p>The two demons fought for hundreds of rounds in the blink of an eye.</p><p>They fought from the ground to the sky, and from the sky to the ground.</p><p>The roars shook the heavens.</p><p>The glacier cracked, and a hurricane howled.</p><p>Pang Ji finally vented his anger, using all his abilities and powers. Azure lightning enveloped him, emitting beams of lightning, resembling an Azure Luan, his might extraordinary.</p><p>The blue fox gradually felt overwhelmed, its eyes darting around.  It hadn't expected that the little demon it had driven away years ago would now be stronger and come for revenge.</p><p>Although it had never consumed Emperor's Flowing Liquid, it had lived for a long time and possessed high intelligence.</p><p>Facing such a powerful enemy, it decided to flee.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The blue fox spat out a ball of cold air, the essence of the Xuan Frost gale it had absorbed and refined over the years into a spiritual wind.</p><p>Pang Ji dared not receive it head-on and quickly dodged.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the ball of cold air condensed into a sharp blade as it approached, its speed surging.  In an instant, it pierced the void and struck Pang Ji's chest, about to pierce him and kill him.</p><p>Without looking back at the result, the blue fox whipped its tail and turned to flee.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for that!”</p><p>Pang Ji laughed calmly, opening his mouth, and the treasure orb left by the demon king floated out lightly.</p><p>The orb appeared thin, but when the ice blade struck it, not only was it unharmed, but the blade instantly turned to dust.</p><p>Pang Ji roared with laughter, closed his wings, and pounced on the blue fox.</p><p>Lightning flickered on his claws, ready to crush the blue fox’s skull.</p><p>Lan Hu dodged hastily, but Fat Chicken's attacks came in quick succession.  A sudden bolt of lightning shattered Lan Hu's protective aura, striking a vital point.  He tumbled from the clouds, crashing onto the ice and rolling into a heap.</p><p>Severely wounded, Lan Hu could flee no longer.  He lay on his back, pleading with Fat Chicken, who was charging down, whimpering repeatedly.</p><p>Remembering past grievances, Fat Chicken's blood boiled.  There was no way he would let his enemy live.  Without mercy, he disemboweled Lan Hu, tearing at him with his claws, retrieving Lan Hu's demon core and swallowing it whole.</p><p>Revenge accomplished, Fat Chicken cleaned up the mess Lan Hu had made in the cave and went to rendezvous with Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't ask about the details, but stored Fat Chicken in the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring and set off towards Blood Lake.</p><p>The danger deep within Wuyagu Valley was comparable to the abyssal ruins, making every step difficult.</p><p>But Qin Sang, who could navigate the abyssal ruins with ease, found these obstacles trivial.</p><p>With time to spare before the appointed hour, Qin Sang explored Wuyagu Valley, collecting several types of spirit herbs and fruits. Unfortunately, the spirit of the Killing Sword remained unresponsive.</p><p>Five days later, Qin Sang found Blood Lake.</p><p>"Daoist Mingyue has arrived."</p><p>More than a dozen figures stood at the edge of Blood Lake.</p><p>Xiang Qing, the closest to Wuyagu Valley and thus the first to arrive, greeted Qin Sang. They had collaborated on subduing the Ancestral Saint Fire at Shen Gang Peak, establishing a connection.</p><p>Next to Xiang Qing stood a Yuan Ying stage demonic cultivator who had been guarding the Blood Lake seal and relaying information.</p><p>The rest were all Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>"Daoist Xiang, Daoist Hong..."</p><p>Qin Sang greeted them.</p><p>He was surprised to see the Golden Core cultivators standing far off, whispering amongst themselves.  Blood Lake presented not just one challenge; even Yuan Ying masters had to proceed with caution.</p><p>The purpose of entering Blood Lake was to deal with the Abyss of Sin, and these Golden Core cultivators wouldn't be of much help; they would only be a burden.</p><p>Xiang Qing glanced at them and said dismissively, "They're just desperate individuals, who somehow heard about Blood Lake's appearance and want to take a chance.  Someone might be incredibly lucky, like the one who found the Wujian Blood Mulberry in Blood Lake back then. However, how many will survive is another matter."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed these cultivators were mostly disciples from various sects, well-informed, likely guided by their elders.</p><p>While they lacked for nothing in cultivation resources, being stuck at a bottleneck for a hundred years or more was common.  Bold individuals often ventured into forbidden areas and secret realms seeking opportunities.</p><p>Qin Sang had done the same.</p><p>"This is Blood Lake? Smaller than the one in the abyssal ruins..."</p><p>Qin Sang took a few steps forward, observing Blood Lake.</p><p>Blood Lake was nestled between two ancient forbidden cloud formations, revealing only a narrow, ribbon-like gap. They were standing at one end of that gap.</p><p>Strangely, Blood Lake seemed to float in mid-air, neither touching the earth nor the sky, constantly emitting a blood-like aura.</p>
