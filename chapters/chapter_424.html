<h1>Chapter 417 The Lure</h1><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The walls echoed with the roar of water.</p><p>Golden light, like a surging river, shot out in all directions, engulfing the black-robed figure.</p><p>Before the figure's pressure could reach the silver-robed man, it was forcefully suppressed by the grand formation.</p><p>The black-robed figure swayed slightly, momentarily held in place by the golden light.</p><p>Undeterred, the figure tried to channel their spiritual power to break through the formation.</p><p>The crowd in the hall panicked, scrambling for safety. Only the VIPs in the second and third-floor boxes remained unmoved, yet none offered to help Mr. Kan.</p><p>Suppressing his anger, Mr. Kan abruptly shouted, “Senior, I respect your high cultivation, but the rules of the auction cannot be broken! If you insist, I'm willing to risk my life and destroy this formation, teaching you a lesson you'll never forget! I believe you can sense the power of this formation. Even if you kill me, the price will be something you are unwilling to pay!”</p><p>The black-robed figure paused, glancing at the aggressive golden light, and finally withdrew their surging spiritual power.</p><p>Mr. Kan's racing heart finally calmed. His tone softened as he cupped his hands towards the black-robed figure and said soothingly, “Senior, I understand your disappointment at losing the treasure. But are there not other spirit medicines in the world besides Blood Essence? Now that the Ancient Immortal Battlefield is becoming increasingly dangerous, cultivators outside the Pass are starting to return to the city. Perhaps they will bring back spirit medicines even more precious than Blood Essence. Please be patient, Senior, and continue your search. You will surely find what you seek.”</p><p>The black-robed figure snorted coldly and turned to leave.</p><p>Mr. Kan had long since given up on befriending this person. Such a narrow-minded, volatile individual, relying on their cultivation to act recklessly, could be useful, but getting too close might not be a good thing, potentially inviting disaster.</p><p>Good riddance!</p><p>“Quickly escort the senior to the tea room to rest!”</p><p>Mr. Kan arranged for someone to escort the black-robed figure away. He breathed a sigh of relief and looked at the silver-robed man, secretly surprised.</p><p>This person was remarkably composed.</p><p>Even when the black-robed figure’s pressure was almost upon him, the silver-robed man remained calm and unperturbed. This composure was the mark of a true master, far superior to the black-robed figure.  As long as their talent wasn't exceptionally poor, their future achievements would be considerable.</p><p>Befriending this person might prove to be a great advantage in the future.</p><p>“Are there any other bids?”</p><p>After waiting for a moment, Mr. Kan, seeing no further bids, presented the Blood Essence to the silver-robed man and announced loudly, "Fifteen thousand low-grade spirit stones! The Blood Essence now belongs to this fellow Daoist!"</p><p>“Next item…”</p><p>…</p><p>Leaving aside the disrupted auction, the black-robed figure, after leaving the hall, was led by two beautiful young women to a tea room.</p><p>The tea room was also within the formation; no one could leave before the auction ended.</p><p>“Immortal, please have some tea…”</p><p>The two young women nervously served the tea.</p><p>The black-robed figure snapped, “Get out!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Relieved, the young women hurriedly set down the tea and rushed out.</p><p>The black-robed figure sat motionless. The face beneath the hood was Qin Sang!</p><p>At some point, he had left Green Sun Market, arrived at Heavenly Gloom Pass, and even caused a scene at the auction.</p><p>Now, there wasn't a trace of anger on his face. He was exceptionally calm, a thoughtful look in his eyes, as if pondering something.</p><p>His outburst at the auction was a deliberate act, not truly aimed at the Blood Essence. He had his own motives.</p><p>He had already investigated Mr. Kan's conduct and acted with careful measure. Otherwise, making an enemy of Mr. Kan before accomplishing his goal would have been a grave mistake.</p><p>Silence filled the tea room. Qin Sang sat in his seat for a while before a young woman’s trembling voice sounded from outside, “Senior, the auction has ended…”</p><p>He was then escorted out like a plague.</p><p>Upon leaving the auction, Qin Sang immediately concealed himself, quietly departing Heavenly Gloom Pass. Gazing at the vast expanse of mud and swamp, he pondered for a moment, then urged the Stygian Cloud, flying at full speed eastward.</p><p>There, in that direction, lay Green Sun City!</p><p>Not long after Qin Sang left, as dawn broke in the east, a middle-aged man left Heavenly Gloom Pass.</p><p>This man was ordinary in appearance but possessed a refined air, dressed in simple robes, resembling a scholar. Unfortunately, cultivators weren't judged by their appearance but by their cultivation.</p><p>His aura wasn't strong, appearing to have just broken through to Foundation Establishment.</p><p>He walked away from Heavenly Gloom Pass and, upon reaching the swamp, flew using body refinement techniques, his speed not particularly fast.</p><p>It was unclear what he intended. He flew aimlessly through the swamp, sometimes making large circles. After more than half an hour, he landed on a withered tree.</p><p>He looked back, confirming that no one was following him, a mocking sneer appearing on his face. “Cowardly rat! I didn’t even bother hiding, and you still didn’t dare follow! Consider yourself lucky, old man!”</p><p>This was the silver-robed man who had been targeted by Qin Sang at the auction.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, demonic energy surged from his body, transforming him into a streak of black light as he flew eastward.</p><p>His true cultivation was finally revealed – the astonishing level of False Core Realm!</p><p>The streak of light was incredibly fast, quickly leaving the swamp behind.</p><p>Ahead lay a desolate landscape of mountains and valleys.</p><p>The silver-robed man's speed didn't decrease as he entered the depths of the mountains.  Not long after, a soft exclamation came from within the streak of light. Then, it changed direction, landing on a mountain peak.</p><p>The silver-robed man looked surprised, staring north towards a colossal mountain range resembling a giant dragon.</p><p>From that direction, a strange fluctuation faintly emanated.</p><p>This fluctuation was unique to a secret technique known as the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu, a distant memory.</p><p>Since the destruction of his sect, the Soul-Yin Sect, the few remaining Heart-Devouring Insect Gu, along with the sect leader, were destroyed in the self-destruction of the Yuan Zhao Sect. This secret technique was declared lost.</p><p>The Heart-Devouring Insects were long extinct. The corpses of the insects, sealed in glaciers, were extremely rare. The Soul-Yin Sect, with all its resources, had only managed to collect a few. Finding more would be difficult.</p><p>After the destruction of his sect, he and his master became fugitives, constantly pursued. Only in the last decade or so, with the cultivation world of the Small Cold Region preoccupied with the spiritual tide and the Heavenly March Alliance, and the Yuan Zhao Sect no longer so aggressive, had they been able to breathe freely and act openly.</p><p>Those previously controlled by the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu had long since disappeared.</p><p>Yet one had appeared here.</p><p>The silver-robed man gazed intently. He recognized the mountain range. Beneath it lay a large spiritual vein, with numerous excellent caves. The fluctuation indicated that the person was motionless, likely cultivating in a cave.</p><p>“I didn’t encounter them last time. Could this person have just returned from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield? I wonder which sect's pawn they are?”</p><p>The silver-robed man pondered. “There are countless secret techniques in the world.  The poison Gu created by our ancestor is difficult to cure, but there might be ways to suppress it.  Furthermore, if this Heart-Devouring Insect Gu was implanted before the destruction of our sect, this person’s cultivation might be considerable, perhaps not inferior to mine.  Relying solely on the insect Gu might not be enough to control them…”</p>
