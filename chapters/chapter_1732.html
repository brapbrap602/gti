<h1>Chapter 1723: Southward Journey</h1><p>Hearing one inconceivable secret after another, these apex cultivators, whose faces remained unchanged even when mountains crumbled before them, were stunned.</p><p>Was this still the world they knew?</p><p>Yet, with True Monarch Qin's personal testimony and the corroboration of the three sects of Buddhism, Daoism, and Demonic Cultivation, coupled with all the strange occurrences they'd witnessed, they couldn't help but believe.</p><p>Qin Sang had already done his utmost by reminding them.  Having said all he could, whether they believed or not was no longer his concern.  He made them swear oaths of secrecy before dismissing the crowd.</p><p>The grand ceremony drew to a close.</p><p>The unaware guests returned home filled with novelty and excitement.</p><p>Everyone discussed the Ascension Platform, believing that cultivators in this realm now had another path. Those who couldn't achieve Deity Transformation and were facing death now had a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Those who knew the truth, however, were deeply worried.</p><p>It wasn't that a new path had opened, but that the old one had closed!</p><p>The Ascension Platform might be their only hope from now on.</p><p>It was foreseeable that after the ceremony, as the news spread throughout the cultivation world, it would inevitably trigger a massive wave of searches for the Ascension Platform.</p><p>Various factions would spare no effort, scouring ancient texts, exploring hidden places, and searching for secrets.</p><p>Mobilizing the entire cultivation world's power was undoubtedly more effective and promising than the strength of a single person or sect.</p><p>This was precisely what Qin Sang wanted to see.</p><p>The guests dispersed.</p><p>Venom King and Elder Ming of the Myriad Venom Mountain bid farewell to Master Xingji.  Reaching the temple gate and about to take flight back to Myriad Venom Mountain, they suddenly heard a voice behind them.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, please wait."</p><p>Venom King turned around and saw Qin Sang approaching slowly. "This humble Daoist has long heard of the wondrous and unique scenery of Myriad Venom Mountain, quite different from other sects. I intend to pay a visit."</p><p>Ill intentions!</p><p>Venom King's expression stiffened slightly.</p><p>He had repeatedly offered kind advice, yet this person avoided the topic, clearly intending to seize the Venom King.</p><p>Since he had achieved True Monarch status, Venom King would have accepted it, but for him to come knocking again, he clearly had other motives.</p><p>Was the Venom King not enough to satisfy his appetite?</p><p>Too much!</p><p>Venom King felt inwardly annoyed, his lips twitching.  "True Monarch's gracious presence brings honor to our humble abode. Elder Ming, quickly return to the mountain and summon the disciples to welcome True Monarch."</p><p>Elder Ming acknowledged the order and prepared to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand to stop him, saying, "This is a private visit, no need for such fanfare... This humble Daoist has already made an appointment with Sect Master Yan of the瓊影門 (Qiong Ying Sect). If you two fellow Daoists have no urgent matters, why not join us?"</p><p>Venom King and Elder Ming exchanged glances, cupping their hands and saying, "We dare not disobey True Monarch's command."</p><p>The three paused for a moment, waiting for the Qiong Ying Sect group to arrive.</p><p>The Qiong Ying Sect consisted mostly of female cultivators, with a disproportionate number of women to men.</p><p>Sect Master Yan was dressed as a Daoist nun, her face beautiful and refined, her eyebrows carrying a heroic air.  Having been in a position of authority for a long time, she commanded respect without needing to display anger, making people hesitant to approach her.</p><p>Qin Sang had encountered the Grand Elder of Qiong Ying Sect at the Six Continents Hall auction, but both had concealed their identities and hadn't seen each other's true faces.</p><p>Qin Sang learned from Sect Master Yan that the Grand Elder of Qiong Ying Sect was approaching her Heavenly Tribulation and was currently in secluded cultivation, hence her absence.</p><p>Instead of using flying artifacts, the group traveled on clouds, talking as they went.</p><p>Qin Sang stated his purpose.</p><p>Upon learning that Qin Sang wanted to consult on refining techniques, Sect Master Yan readily agreed, saying, "True Monarch enlightening us is such a righteous act! This mere refining path, I dare not keep to myself, but I fear it may not meet True Monarch's discerning eye."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't neglect Venom King and Elder Ming, discussing the Dao of Venom with them.</p><p>With Sect Master Yan's words preceding them, Venom King couldn't hide anything.</p><p>The group chatted pleasantly until they reached Qiong Ying Sect.</p><p>Qiong Ying Sect was located slightly north of the Fu River mouth, near the East Sea on Qiong Ying Lake. Spirit formations created mist, concealing the mountain gate. Outsiders could only see a spirit island in the mist and a small pavilion in the center of the lake.</p><p>Little did they know that beyond the lake pavilion lay another world.</p><p>Entering the mountain gate, Qin Sang saw spirit islands scattered across the lake, each with breathtaking scenery, elegant and pleasing, befitting a sect primarily composed of female cultivators.</p><p>True to her word, Sect Master Yan immediately sent someone to fetch the sect's classics.</p><p>Among them was the "Art of Spirit Confinement" that Qin Sang had requested.</p><p>It wasn't just the fragmented version from the auction.</p><p>Qiong Ying Sect had excavated the ruins of Profound Artifact Mountain and continued collecting over time. They not only obtained most of Profound Artifact Mountain's inheritance, but through generations of masters' research and comprehension, and further additions and improvements, they had surpassed the original.</p><p>The Seven Islands of the Water Mirror, renowned for their refining skills, admitted their inferiority to Qiong Ying Sect.</p><p>This "Art of Spirit Confinement" not only allowed the refinement of pseudo-spiritual treasures, but when cultivated to its peak, it could truly imbue treasures with spirituality, allowing them to advance into true spiritual treasures!</p><p>Furthermore, it included methods for nurturing spiritual treasures after their advancement.</p><p>However, imbuing a spiritual treasure with a tool spirit was far more difficult than simply refining one, a feat Qin Sang didn't dare to hope for yet.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang didn't plan to nurture the Grey Warbler Sword, obtaining this refining secret technique greatly benefited him, broadening his horizons and even providing insights he could apply to the Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>Staying at Qiong Ying Sect for more than ten days, Qin Sang received meticulous guidance from Sect Master Yan and the refining masters. He vowed not to divulge the secrets but secured an opportunity for Shen Chen.</p><p>During this time, Venom King and Elder Ming also remained at Qiong Ying Sect.</p><p>After Qin Sang finished his consultation on refining techniques, the three left together, heading straight for Myriad Venom Mountain without stopping along the way.</p><p>Myriad Venom Mountain was located in the sparsely populated Savage Prefecture.</p><p>Savage Prefecture was filled with perilous mountains and treacherous waters. The cave abode occupied by Myriad Venom Mountain was a rare paradise.  However, multicolored mist drifted within the mountain gate, and various venomous creatures roamed about, lending it a touch of the Savage Prefecture's character.</p><p>After Qin Sang entered the mountain with Venom King and Elder Ming, he saw that almost every Myriad Venom Mountain disciple carried a venomous insect or beast. Some had even disfigured themselves due to careless handling of venom, appearing as fearsome as ghosts.</p><p>No wonder cultivators outside held Myriad Venom Mountain in awe and fear.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know when Venom King had sent the message, but Master Xingji was already waiting there when they arrived.</p><p>"My apologies for keeping Master waiting," Qin Sang greeted him with a smile.</p><p>Entering the main hall, Qin Sang met the various elders of Myriad Venom Mountain. Venom King then instructed everyone else to withdraw, and Master Xingji tactfully retreated with a bow.</p><p>The two sat facing each other, a table between them laden with spiritual fruits, immortal peaches, jade dew, and fine nectar.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the jade cup before him.  Myriad Venom Mountain was truly unique; the spirit wine within was a deep墨绿色 (mo green), almost black.  If not for the enticing aroma, one might suspect it was venom rather than wine.</p><p>"Please, True Monarch Qin, taste our sect's Myriad Venom Wine!" Venom King gestured, raising his cup for a toast.</p><p>As the wine entered his mouth, Qin Sang felt a burning sensation down his throat, like a line of fire descending into his stomach.  A ball of fire within him exploded, surging through his limbs and bones, as if cleansing his entire body, an incredibly invigorating experience.</p><p>"Good wine! Thank you, Fellow Daoist, for your hospitality!"</p><p>Qin Sang praised, then sighed, "Back then, when Fellow Daoist was trapped by the Ancient Demon, this humble Daoist was deeply worried about your situation, but unfortunately, my strength was meager, and I was unable to assist."</p><p>"I appreciate True Monarch's kindness," Venom King said, gripping his jade cup and quietly observing Qin Sang.</p><p>With a concerned tone, Qin Sang asked, "Fellow Daoist was able to resist the Ancient Demon, presumably by relying on the power of your esteemed sect's sacred artifact? After such a fierce battle, I wonder how the sacred artifact is faring. Has it suffered any damage?"</p><p>As expected, he's after the sacred artifact!</p><p>Venom King's expression darkened slightly. "Thank you for True Monarch's concern. The sacred artifact exhausted its essence in that battle. Being inanimate, its recovery is extremely slow. It's currently being nurtured in the forbidden grounds."</p><p>Venom King was telling the truth.</p><p>The sacred artifact's true form was a Fifth Transformation Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit. Unfortunately, Myriad Venom Mountain only possessed its corpse.  Later, they refined the corpse into a Gu, restoring some of its power, but it was far from a true living creature.</p><p>First, wielding the sacred artifact required mastery of Myriad Venom Mountain's true teachings, as it had been continuously refined by generations of sect masters using true methods to achieve its current power.</p><p>Second, wielding it was difficult.  Even Venom King, the sect master, who had personally refined it for many years, had to pay a price.</p><p>Third, after each use, it needed to be placed in Myriad Venom Mountain's forbidden grounds for a long period of recovery. During the Formless Immortal Sect incident, it was fortunate that the sacred artifact had devoured fire venom on Fire Rhinoceros Island beforehand, otherwise, it might have suffered irreparable damage.</p><p>However, if it didn't have these characteristics, it would likely have been borrowed by Sage Huiguang and Sage Qinghu long before Qin Sang's arrival.</p><p>In the Formless Immortal Sect battle, the grey cocoon formed by the sacred artifact had been remarkably effective, able to withstand Deity Transformation level techniques, making it a rare and valuable protective treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, pondering for a moment before saying, "Then I'm relieved... To be frank, Fellow Daoist, the purpose of my visit is to inquire about a few matters, which are somewhat related to your esteemed sect's sacred artifact."</p><p>Venom King's hand tightened around the jade cup, nearly shattering it.</p><p>"Is it because the Venom King's realm is too low to meet True Monarch's requirements?"</p><p>A hint of sarcasm flashed in Venom King's eyes, but his tone remained calm. "Unfortunately, even if I were to offer the sacred artifact with both hands, it would be useless in True Monarch's possession unless True Monarch is willing to switch sects and cultivate our Myriad Venom Mountain's true teachings..."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang seemed oblivious to Venom King's anger, asking curiously, "I didn't expect your esteemed sect's sacred artifact to have such a peculiar origin. I observe that the Venom King and the sacred artifact are vastly different in form, yet there seems to be a certain connection.  I wonder what the reason might be?"</p><p>Venom King frowned.</p><p>This was a Myriad Venom Mountain secret, how could it be divulged?</p><p>Qin Sang said meaningfully, "When slaying that strange-faced man, this humble Daoist discovered something unexpected. As he was dying, he was backlashed by the Venom King. Coupled with the residual poison of the sacred artifact within his body, the two potent venoms fused into one, creating an incredibly terrifying toxicity.  This humble Daoist intended to capture his Nascent Soul for soul searching, but could only watch helplessly as he was reduced to ashes, unable to prevent it."</p><p>Venom King's face changed several times upon hearing this.</p><p>Myriad Venom Mountain had given the strange-faced man the sacred artifact's fluff to continuously trigger the residual venom within him, keeping him constantly on the run.  They never anticipated that someone with such formidable strength would die at the hands of another, and be backlashed by the Venom King in his final moments.</p><p>Sighing, Venom King said, "Since True Monarch has slain that scoundrel, you presumably obtained our sect's true teachings, the 'Gu Sutra'.  I wonder if you have attempted Gu refinement?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied frankly, "I have tried and benefited from it. One of my spirit insects achieved a breakthrough thanks to this technique."</p><p>"The Venom King was born from the art of Gu refinement.  However, nurturing the Venom King not only consumed several rare venomous insects, but also incorporated the essence extracted from the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit's corpse. After obtaining the corpse, our ancestor attempted to use Gu refinement to create a true Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit.  Unfortunately, a dead thing is a dead thing, only capable of carrying a portion of its former power. The only way was to divide its essence and take a different approach, refining a new Gu insect that could inherit the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit's abilities."</p><p>Venom King couldn't help but glance at Qin Sang.  "Our sect has attempted this countless times, all ending in failure, with the Venom King being the only survivor. Because the Venom King and the sacred artifact share the same origin, their toxicity can merge."</p><p>And then it was stolen by the strange-faced man!</p><p>Although Qin Sang hadn't inquired about the strange-faced man's background in detail, he guessed that he must have had a close relationship with Myriad Venom Mountain in the past, otherwise he wouldn't have had access to the Venom King.</p><p>"From Fellow Daoist's words, it seems there's only one Venom King, and it can't be replicated?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Venom King said despondently, "I don't even know how it survived... Had I known, I would have guarded it more closely."</p><p>Myriad Venom Mountain had attempted countless times, all ending in failure.  The facts proved that success was nearly impossible.</p><p>Venom King didn't believe he could achieve it, merely following his master's instructions. Unexpectedly, he succeeded, only for it to be stolen by a thief, leaving him filled with regret.</p><p>"Perhaps the Venom King's survival has something to do with the strange-faced man?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang suddenly said, "Your esteemed sect expended vast resources to nurture the Venom King.  There must be more to it than just obtaining a Gu insect, right?"</p><p>Without waiting for Venom King's reply, Qin Sang continued, "This humble Daoist kept the Venom King because I'm interested in the Dao of Venom. The Venom King has already been used for another purpose, and it's impossible to return it to Fellow Daoist. However, I have an idea."</p><p>Venom King's brow furrowed.  "Please enlighten me, True Monarch."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "I want to know the true purpose of your sect's Venom King refinement.  The Venom King is gone, but this humble Daoist can wield its venom power, perhaps I can be of some assistance."</p><p>Venom King shook his head. "Unless True Monarch is willing to return the Venom King to our sect."</p><p>"I'm all ears," Qin Sang said seriously.</p><p>Venom King remained silent for a while before saying, "Nurturing the Venom King is related to our sect's true cultivation method. The Venom King's maturation would greatly benefit me and future generations of our sect... True Monarch, there's no need to say more. If you want the fused venom, I can gift you a bottle of venomous smoke exhaled by the sacred artifact. I would also like to request some of the Venom King's venom from True Monarch."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, seemingly unsurprised.</p><p>He shared an intimate connection with the Venom Pearl. The Venom Pearl refining the Venom King was equivalent to him refining it. He had sensed something earlier.</p><p>Seeing that Venom King was still unwilling to reveal the truth, he spoke frankly, "The Venom King's maturation would allow it to merge with the sacred artifact, correct? Or perhaps devour it. This wouldn't simply fuse their toxicities, as that would only be superficial! You want to recreate the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit's original venom, and use it to verify and comprehend the true meaning of your cultivation method, thereby achieving Deity Transformation. Am I right?"</p><p>Venom King's expression changed dramatically upon hearing this.</p><p>Before Venom King could respond, Qin Sang waved his hand to interrupt.  "Don't worry, this humble Daoist isn't trying to forcefully seize it. I want to discuss a mutually beneficial method with Fellow Daoist."</p><p>At this point, Venom King couldn't hide anything anymore. He said quietly, "True Monarch doesn't cultivate our sect's methods, so even if I give you the sacred artifact, you wouldn't be able to recreate the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit's original venom."</p><p>"How do you know I can't?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled enigmatically.</p><p>Although he couldn't recreate the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit, he could devour the sacred artifact's venom power and restore the true Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit's original venom, not just a simple fusion.</p><p>This was the Venom Pearl's ability!</p><p>Qin Sang had only discovered this after refining the Venom King, marveling at Fatty's talent.</p><p>Venom King was utterly astonished.</p><p>"This humble Daoist would like to request the sacred artifact's venom from Fellow Daoist, without harming its main body, allowing it to recover slowly. After the fusion, once the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit's original venom is obtained, I'll gift some to Fellow Daoist.  How about that?"</p><p>Qin Sang proposed.</p><p>How could Venom King refuse? He sighed, "Unfortunately, the Demonic Sound blocks the path. Obtaining the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit's original venom is too late."</p><p>...</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>Qin Sang left Myriad Venom Mountain and traveled southeast, arriving at the Veiled Moon Convent.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
