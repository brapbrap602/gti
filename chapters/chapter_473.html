<h1>Chapter 466: Pure Land</h1><p>Elder Jing seemed not to hear Qin Sang's warning.  She gazed into the depths of the canyon, her eyes unusually bright, holding a chaotic, profound, and mysterious light, as she used some kind of technique affecting her pupils.</p><p>Qin Sang, helpless, did his best to conceal his aura, moving silently through the black mist.</p><p>As he drew closer to the other person, Qin Sang finally sensed a faint aura, a pleased expression appearing on his face. He stopped, unable to resist sending another voice transmission to Elder Jing.</p><p>"Senior, it's not someone from our Little Cold Region. It's someone from the Skywalk League…"</p><p>Only familiar faces from Little Cold Region had entered this place. Based on the aura, Qin Sang could generally determine the person's identity, similar to the cultivator surnamed Wei from the Ancient Will Sect he had encountered earlier.</p><p>The aura of the person ahead was unfamiliar.  Qin Sang had been dealing with the Skywalk League for three years, clashing with most of their experts, and knowing some less familiar ones as well.</p><p>This was the second person they'd encountered since entering the Pointing Heaven Peak. Having traveled so far with Elder Jing and only meeting two people showed just how vast the peak was.</p><p>Since this person was an enemy of the Skywalk League, Qin Sang certainly didn't want to miss this opportunity, but it depended on Elder Jing's wishes.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed ahead, looking at Elder Jing inquiringly.</p><p>However, Elder Jing remained gazing into the deep valley, ignoring Qin Sang's direction.  She decisively said, "Go around."</p><p>This was different from last time.</p><p>Last time, the cultivator surnamed Wei was from Little Cold Region, and Elder Jing was unwilling to let them fight each other.</p><p>This time, the reason was clearly different.</p><p>Serving different masters, Elder Jing wouldn't have any mercy for a Skywalk League cultivator, but she didn't want to waste time on this person.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed the reason and sighed inwardly, having to obey.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>After taking a few steps, Qin Sang's expression suddenly shifted, a hesitant look appearing on his face. "Junior is being presumptuous, please forgive me, Senior. I wonder… how much further is our destination?"</p><p>Elder Jing finally deigned to look away, giving Qin Sang a deep look. After a moment's thought, she spoke sparingly, "Soon!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, "As expected," and immediately pursued with sincere urgency, "Junior has a humble request… when we encounter restrictions later, could Senior please help me conceal my spiritual energy fluctuations, so that he doesn't discover my presence?"</p><p>Elder Jing was reluctant to take action, but Qin Sang didn't want to give up this rare chance.</p><p>Within Pointing Heaven Peak, he didn't fear attracting the attention of powerful figures.  He could use the Ebony Sword and the Ten Directions Yama Banner without restraint, along with the combat experience he'd accumulated over the past three years.</p><p>Even without Elder Jing's help, Qin Sang was ninety percent confident in subduing the opponent.</p><p>Elder Jing agreed that after they reached their destination, he could withdraw, as he wouldn't be needed for what came after.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to return alone, so it was best if the other party didn't discover his presence, to avoid alerting them and possibly causing them to leave.</p><p>Restrictions were densely packed here, some incredibly powerful. Even with Elder Jing's warnings, Qin Sang had to be fully focused, which might alert the other person. He could only rely on Elder Jing to mask his spiritual energy fluctuations.</p><p>Qin Sang had only asked tentatively, but Elder Jing readily agreed.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed, putting aside his other thoughts and concentrating on following Elder Jing's guidance as they moved through the canyon.</p><p>With Elder Jing helping to conceal him, the Skywalk League cultivator indeed didn't notice him. One person passed by without noticing him; he was busy collecting starstones.</p><p>After bypassing this person, urged by Elder Jing, Qin Sang quickened his pace.</p><p>Elder Jing was now more willing to lend a hand, helping Qin Sang break powerful restriction fragments blocking their path.</p><p>Further in, restrictions became denser and more dangerous, making progress almost impossible.  Without Elder Jing, Qin Sang couldn't have possibly reached this place alone.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully memorized the route as he went, fearing he wouldn't be able to find his way back later.</p><p>Elder Jing's goal was clear: she went straight ahead.</p><p>Deeper into the canyon, the cold intensified, and the black mist thinned, yet it became even darker. Even with Qin Sang's cultivation, he couldn't see very far with his eyes alone.</p><p>While breaking restrictions, Qin Sang observed the surroundings with his peripheral vision.</p><p>Along the way, there had been countless rocks and black weeds, leading him to believe this was a desolate valley.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just a moment ago, a stone path paved with stone slabs suddenly appeared beneath his feet.  Though the path was almost unrecognizable, with all the slabs broken, it was clearly man-made.</p><p>Elder Jing ordered Qin Sang to proceed along the stone path.  Her destination seemed to be at the end of it.</p><p>What lies ahead?</p><p>Qin Sang was curious, but his expression remained unchanged. He obediently followed Granny Jing's instructions.  Meanwhile, in his spiritual space, a storm raged as he secretly mobilized his spiritual sense.  His ebony sword silently detached itself, its body trembling slightly, poised for action.</p><p>He wouldn't, and dared not, attack Granny Jing.  Given Granny Jing's nature, she probably wouldn't break her promise or betray him.  </p><p>But caution was necessary. If her previous actions were all a pretense, he would accept his fate, but he wouldn't submit passively. He would fight to the death. He was confident his ebony sword would leave a lasting impression on her!</p><p>The stone path was unimaginably long.  Finally, two broken pillars appeared ahead, standing on either side of the path.  They were incredibly thick, like two gigantic pillars holding up the heavens. One could imagine their original height; they might have even towered over the canyon, reaching the sky. Sadly, they were now almost completely shattered, leaving only remnants.</p><p>Many large boulders were scattered around the pillars. Further ahead, it was unclear, but it looked like a stone-paved plaza.</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly.  Hearing no further instructions from Granny Jing, he continued walking, soon arriving beside the two pillars. A vast plaza appeared before them.</p><p>It was unbelievable. At the bottom of the canyon, there was such a large space, and the ruins of a grand plaza.  Standing at the edge, Qin Sang felt insignificant.</p><p>The circular plaza was composed of countless identical, massive stone blocks, each tens of meters long and wide.  Concentric circles of these blocks formed a peculiar shape: higher on the outside, lower in the center, like an inverted funnel.  If it were the other way around—higher in the center, lower on the outside—it would resemble an altar for sacrificial rites.  This strange shape made it difficult for Qin Sang to discern the plaza's true purpose.</p><p>Several similar pillars, also broken at the base, stood at the plaza's outer edge.  Large and small stones, the remnants of those pillars, littered the plaza.  The debris had severely damaged the plaza, leaving it in ruins.</p><p>Even more peculiar, Qin Sang looked around and found not a single fragment of restriction.  The entire canyon was filled with restrictions, dangers lurking every few steps, yet this place was an exception. The plaza seemed to be the only untouched area in the canyon.</p>
