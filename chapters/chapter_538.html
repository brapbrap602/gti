<h1>Chapter 531: Sealing the Mountain</h1><p>Gang Jade is a peculiar substance.</p><p>Untouched, it possesses extreme hardness.</p><p>The Gang Jade Qin Sang initially chose was the size of an infant, and only after absorbing nearly all its Gang Qi did it shatter.</p><p>Once removed from Divine Gang Peak, it becomes unstable and quickly dissipates.</p><p>However, retrieving those Gang Jade stones from Divine Gang Peak safely would likely prove challenging.</p><p>The stability of the Ancestral Sacred Flame is linked to the Gang Jade.</p><p>And the Ancestral Sacred Flame itself serves as the protector of the Gang Jade.</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly channeled his True Essence, his figure flickering and vanishing. He realized his speed had also dramatically increased, now rivaling a genuine Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>A thought crossed his mind, and the Ebony Sword flew from between his eyebrows, quietly appearing before him.</p><p>Since True Essence was his own power, it didn't hinder his use of the Ebony Sword. With a thought, the sword flashed with light, instantly circling him before returning to its original position as if it had never moved.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang extended his right hand.</p><p>The Ebony Sword flashed, landing in his palm before transforming into a streak of sword light. Like a playful fish, it nimbly swam around his fingertips.</p><p>A faint smile of satisfaction played on Qin Sang’s lips.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was his Natal Magical Treasure. While usable at the Pseudo Core Formation stage, it had placed a significant burden on him and couldn't unleash its true power.</p><p>Now, things were different.</p><p>He could effortlessly wield the Ebony Sword, executing various sword techniques without any difficulty!</p><p>Regrettably, he couldn't utilize the Sword Qi Thunderclap divine ability. Otherwise, with his current power, why would he fear an early Core Formation opponent?</p><p>They wouldn't be able to catch him!</p><p>Then there’s the Ten Yama Banner.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. The Ebony Sword’s greatest asset now was its inherent Bloodfiend Divine Light, which could catch opponents off guard and create significant trouble.</p><p>But to confront that Core Formation cultivator head-on, he still needed the Ten Yama Banner.</p><p>The Azure Yang Sect's Azure Yang Demonic Flame was formidable. Using the Ebony Sword against a Core Formation level Demonic Flame was unlikely to be effective. The Ten Yama Banner, however, contained the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, a similar peculiar flame, perfect for a counter-attack.</p><p>Since he now appeared monstrous with his altered features, even with the sharpest eyes, that Core Formation cultivator wouldn't recognize his origins.</p><p>Moreover, possessing Core Formation level power, he was no longer the same. He could openly use the Ten Yama Banner without fear of repercussions.</p><p>However, the Ten Yama Banner was buried outside the Azure Yang Sect. First, he had to get out.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his finger, recalling the Ebony Sword and retrieving the Void Thunder from his robes. He was about to use his movement technique to return to the inner sect of the Azure Yang Sect.</p><p>He wondered what the situation was like there now.</p><p>Not long after he set off, Qin Sang suddenly had a premonition. He abruptly turned his head and saw the Azure Yang Sect's mountain gate engulfed in swirling white clouds. The clouds parted to the sides, revealing the stone tablet.</p><p>Seeing the six Foundation Establishment cultivators sitting around the tablet, Qin Sang realized the formation's core was here. He inwardly cursed their composure.</p><p>Despite the anomaly at Divine Gang Peak, they remained unmoved.</p><p>If they had been lured away, he would have escaped long ago!</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, there were originally eight people.</p><p>They were aware of the changes at Divine Gang Peak. After two of their fellow disciples entered the mountain and disappeared, two others went to rescue them and quickly sent back news.</p><p>The Azure Yang Sect was now in chaos. Those two stayed on Divine Gang Peak to appease the other disciples.</p><p>The remaining cultivators knew they couldn't resolve the issue or save their fellow disciples.</p><p>The anomaly at Divine Gang Peak hadn't reached a catastrophic level. They understood that in times like these, maintaining order was paramount.</p><p>After discussion, they decided to follow Elder Wu’s orders before his departure and firmly guard the mountain gate, relaying the news to him as quickly as possible and requesting his return to manage the situation.</p><p>The mountain gate opened wide.</p><p>Qin Sang watched as the six Foundation Establishment cultivators stood up in unison, bowing towards the gate. A streak of rainbow light, as bright as a meteor, shot across the distant sky.</p><p>It was the Core Formation cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He hadn't expected this person to return so quickly.</p><p>His expression shifted. In a flash, he vanished into the forest, suppressing his aura and cautiously approaching the mountain gate.</p><p>“Greetings, Elder Wu!”</p><p>The Core Formation cultivator bypassed the stone steps, the rainbow light flying directly to the mountain gate.</p><p>The disciples didn't question this, instead offering respectful greetings.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>A furious voice, loud enough to echo through the mountains, boomed before the rainbow light even arrived.</p><p>The next moment, the light landed before the six disciples, dissipating to reveal the enraged Elder Wu.</p><p>As the saying goes, one's dwelling influences their Qi, and their nourishment influences their physique.</p><p>Even if a Core Formation cultivator wasn't naturally good-looking or cared little for appearances, their inherent aura was enough to make people overlook everything else.</p><p>Of course, there were exceptions, such as those whose cultivation methods affected their temperament. This was most common among demonic and unorthodox cultivators.</p><p>This man, named Wu Youdao, had been brought to the Azure Yang Sect by his master as a child.  His talent wasn't exceptional among his peers, yet he was the only one who successfully formed his core, becoming the Azure Yang Sect's fourth Core Formation expert.</p><p>Others, more talented than him, were either struggling at the Pseudo Core Formation stage or had ventured out seeking opportunities, gradually disappearing without a trace.</p><p>With Wu Youdao's composure, he wouldn't typically display his anger so openly, but he genuinely felt like exploding.</p><p>This was the first time he’d guarded the mountain gate alone since forming his core.</p><p>He had been cultivating peacefully in his cave.</p><p>First, a beast tide erupted in Boundless Valley, affecting several promising disciples, forcing him to intervene. The Azure Yang Sect wasn't like those large sects with vast resources; every disciple with the potential to form a core was precious.</p><p>Unexpectedly, shortly after arriving at Boundless Valley, he received news of the Ancestral Sacred Flame's anomaly!</p><p>Exhausted from running around, Wu Youdao felt like the heavens were against him. He was irritated with everyone.</p><p>The six disciples noticed Wu Youdao's fury and, fearing becoming his targets, nervously reported, “Reporting to Elder Wu, the eight of us followed your orders and sealed the mountain gate. The Ancestral Sacred Flame suddenly displayed unusual signs, and Disciples Dong and Zhu went to investigate but were trapped by it for some reason. Fortunately, the Ancestral Sacred Flame itself remains stable. Two other disciples are currently calming the other disciples. We don't yet know the exact cause of the anomaly…”</p><p>“Everything was normal at Divine Gang Peak when I left. I'll see what it is…”</p><p>Wu Youdao snorted, flicking his sleeve, about to return to the inner sect. Suddenly, he remembered something and said coldly, “After Li Qing returns, spare no spirit stones and immediately seal the mountain until the Sect Leader returns! It's a turbulent time, and I don't have the energy to constantly go out and rescue people. Understood?”</p><p>The six disciples exchanged glances and replied in unison, “Understood!”</p>
