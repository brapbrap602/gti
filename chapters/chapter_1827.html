<h1>Chapter 1818: Recovery</h1><p>The protective formation's tremors lasted a long time.</p><p>As the shaking gradually subsided, Qin Sang's aura calmed and finally stabilized.</p><p>He opened his eyes, his excitement evident.  Even he hadn't expected to break through to the mid-stage of the fifth level of the *Tianyao Lianxing* cultivation method in just thirty years.</p><p>After calming himself, Qin Sang examined his inner body. This breakthrough had left no hidden problems.  He lightly clenched his fists, feeling an inexhaustible power in his body.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang remembered something and looked up at the Qingluan Dharma Image above him.</p><p>With the breakthrough, the changes in the Qingluan Dharma Image were obvious—the illusory form had become more solid, gradually transforming towards reality, though still far from comparable to the fleeting glimpse he'd had of a demon king's Dharma Image.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered what benefits each transformation of the Qingluan Dharma Image would bring.</p><p>The cultivation method didn't explain it.</p><p>Perhaps different Dharma Images have different effects, or perhaps it's related to bloodline.  Those with bloodline inheritance might intuitively understand, while he could only explore it himself.</p><p>Cultivating the *Tianyao Lianxing* method in human form always presented various difficulties, but Qin Sang was used to it.  He immediately calmed his mind and sensed the Dharma Image.</p><p>…</p><p>One year later.</p><p>A faint golden light flickered in the cave, illuminating the outline of Qin Sang's figure.</p><p>He formed hand seals, the first seal of the *Seven Master Buddha Seals*, the Auspicious Seal.</p><p>The practice requires forming hand seals, chanting mantras, and visualizing the Buddha. Qin Sang had long reached the stage where the heart seal is sufficient, yet he still formed the hand seals.</p><p>However, this Auspicious Seal was vastly different from before.</p><p>“It still doesn't work…”</p><p>A sigh escaped his lips.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, looking at his hands, lost in deep thought.</p><p>Clearly, he was comprehending and practicing the *Seven Master Buddha Seals*, aiming for the unification of the seven seals.</p><p>Five years remained until his agreement with Venerable Zhenru.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang thought the fifty-year agreement was ample time to achieve the unification of the seven seals.  Unexpectedly, he obtained the *Poison God Scripture*, so he focused on cultivation and set aside the *Seven Master Buddha Seals*.</p><p>Improving his cultivation realm first; breaking through would surely make comprehending the Buddha Seals easier.</p><p>As expected, in the year after his breakthrough, Qin Sang made rapid progress, achieving the fusion of five seals. Only the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal and the Vajra Great Freedom Seal remained.</p><p>He was currently attempting to fuse the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal and had encountered a bottleneck at the last moment.</p><p>The fusion of Buddha Seals becomes increasingly difficult with each addition.  Qin Sang had anticipated this, muttering to himself:  "Book learning is ultimately superficial; it needs to be verified through combat…"</p><p>The best opponents for testing the Buddha Seals were ferocious beasts; this would also allow him to comprehend the Dao of Killing and obtain valuable materials—a win-win situation.</p><p>Qin Sang got up, and the Sky Eye Butterfly landed on his shoulder.</p><p>Leaving the cave, he gathered ripe flower dew.  Arriving at two plots of top-quality flowering plants, Qin Sang saw the eye of the array and stopped.</p><p>After staring for a moment, Qin Sang's figure flickered as he crossed the flower fields for the first time, approaching the eye of the array.</p><p>Toxic mist shrouded the area around the eye, and a terrifying crisis seemed to lurk within the gloom. Although Qin Sang had a poison pearl protecting him and cultivated poison arts himself, he still felt an inexplicable discomfort as he approached.</p><p>Finally, he stopped on a mountain several miles away, gazing at the eye of the array.</p><p>According to the *Poison God Scripture* and his judgment of the spirit array, the eye of the array was located deep within the mountain.</p><p>Using his Sky Eye divine ability, he could see a circular stone cave at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Toxic mist billowed from the cave mouth, continuously emanating from within in an impenetrable density.</p><p>Normally, the eye of the array shouldn't accumulate so much poison; it would be processed at a certain point.  These flower fields have been here for an unknown length of time.</p><p>Qin Sang had secretly inquired within Jushan City.  Some sects within Jushan City and the Daoist schools had poison cultivation methods, but few specialized in poison like the Mole Cricket Mountain, and none had any connection to the *Poison God Scripture*.</p><p>There were also no legends about the 'Poison God' in Jushan City.</p><p>Standing there, Qin Sang hesitated and ultimately did not approach the cave entrance.</p><p>“I'll investigate after I break through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage at least.”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>One reason was the perceived danger within the cave, his current strength being insufficient; the other was the insufficient power of the poison pearl.</p><p>When the Fat Silkworm separated the poison pearl, it was only a four-transformation spirit insect. The poison pearl, after being absorbed and reconstituted with the bloodthirsty miasma poison, only then received an upgrade, and that from a dead insect corpse.</p><p>Recently, Qin Sang had focused on his own cultivation, using the poison pearl mainly as an aid to his practice, only absorbing a small amount of flower poison, resulting in slow improvement.</p><p>As Qin Sang's cultivation improved, his rate of poison absorption increased, and he would inevitably need to upgrade the poison pearl to suppress the residual poison.</p><p>However, this would make the flower dew even scarcer, so he would eventually have to investigate the eye of the array.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back at the stone cave before leaving the Poison Lake.  He habitually checked the secret markers and found them all intact.</p><p>Over forty years had passed unnoticed.  The Gui Fang Kingdom and the Daoist Court seemed to have forgotten the Gu Shan Zhi Zhi Altar.  Gui Fang Kingdom was aggressively promoting its divine path, diligently gathering followers, with demonic temples sprouting everywhere. The Daoist Court, however, remained inactive.  Perhaps the two powers were locked in a silent struggle somewhere unseen.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, left the altar, and flew deeper into the Nie Yuan.</p><p>...</p><p>“This is the place.”</p><p>In a boundless expanse of black mire, Qin Sang stood on a tree branch, gazing at the mud pit ahead.  Focusing his senses, he confirmed the presence of the ferocious beast. He'd discovered it earlier, but two other beasts' lairs were nearby, so he’d held back.  His recent breakthrough gave him more confidence.</p><p>After stealthily circling the swamp, he found the other two beasts had vanished.  There was no reason to delay any longer. He unleashed his aura and charged towards the mud pit.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>A wave of mud erupted, revealing a beast with a serpentine head and a tortoise body. Its ferocious gaze locked onto Qin Sang.</p><p>...</p><p>Two months after leaving the altar, Qin Sang returned, his aura thick with bloodlust, his Qianjun Ring holding two Nascent Soul-stage demonic beast cores.  Although he hadn’t faced a beast requiring his full strength, the two battles had solidified his understanding of the Buddha Seal.  The bottleneck was loosening, and six-seal fusion was imminent.</p><p>Instead of immediately returning to his cave abode, Qin Sang decided to visit Gu Shan Zhi.  After traveling southeast for a while, he concealed his presence.  Gui Fang Kingdom's influence was growing, its demonic temples expanding north along Gu Shan Zhi into the Nie Yuan, reaching the northern part of Xingdao Xianhu, effectively blocking the path for Gu Shan Zhi cultivators to enter and exit Nie Yuan.</p><p>It was said that Daoist Court forces were holding the line in the south, preventing further encroachment. However, the sects in the northern part of Gu Shan Zhi lacked the strength to resist Gui Fang Kingdom and could only endure, awaiting the Daoist Court's action.</p><p>Qin Sang navigated familiar territory, passing through several demon god domains until he reached the Serpent Demon's temple.</p><p>The temple, built from rough hewn stones, was sturdy and possessed an ancient aura.  A lifelike statue of the Serpent Demon stood before it, exuding an imposing presence, as if capable of swallowing the sun and moon.</p><p>The Serpent Demon was gathering followers within its territory, not only among the ghost people but also among the mountain goblins and wood sprites.  These spirits gradually become ferocious beasts after birth due to the erosion of the Six Heavenly Ancient Qi.</p><p>By becoming followers of the Serpent Demon, they became more like the ghost people,  receiving divine will. Their intelligence improved, and their savagery diminished.  In a way, the demon god's presence brought about a transformation in the Nie Yuan.</p><p>The Serpent Demon itself greatly benefited from its followers' devotion and worship.  Qin Sang had studied this phenomenon out of curiosity and discovered that the power transfer was facilitated by the statue in front of the temple.  Followers' sincere prayers generated a strange energy, absorbed by the statue and channeled to the Serpent Demon.  The Serpent Demon merely needed to rest in the temple and occasionally fulfill the wishes of its followers.</p><p>The temple and statue were built by Gui Fang Kingdom, while the Serpent Demon reaped the rewards without fully understanding the mechanism. Qin Sang had attempted to comprehend the statue's workings but failed.</p><p>The Serpent Demon, initially somewhat resistant, had grown to enjoy its divine status.</p><p>Inside the temple, the Serpent Demon napped on a soft couch, surrounded by fine bedding and a table laden with spiritual fruits.</p><p>“A pity this isn't Gui Fang Kingdom,”  the Serpent Demon hissed, using its forked tongue to pick up a spirit fruit and devouring it with relish.  “Personal instruction is far more troublesome than this effortless gain. These ghost people and spirits aren't very intelligent, only capable of offering natural spirit fruits as offerings.”</p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared before the couch.</p><p>The Serpent Demon froze, swallowing the fruit in a gulp, scrambling off the bed and prostrating itself.  “My humble self, unaware of Your Excellency’s arrival, failed to offer a proper greeting. Please forgive this transgression.”</p><p>The Serpent Demon had fully adopted the role of a serpent god, showing none of its former vigorous spirit.  There was no competition for followers in the vicinity.  Becoming a god and establishing a temple, all it needed to do was fulfill followers’ wishes to gain power endlessly.  Power gained so easily leads to complacency, feared Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head silently.  Words alone wouldn't awaken the Serpent Demon; only a catastrophic event could shake it from its complacency. Water can carry a boat, and it can also capsize it.</p><p>Qin Sang believed the divine path was far more complex than it seemed.  What would happen to these gods if the Daoist Court launched a counteroffensive, destroying mountains and temples, and taking away their followers?</p><p>“Any news lately?” Qin Sang asked calmly.</p><p>The serpent demon respectfully said, "I've been gathering information about medicinal herbs, and I've made some progress. I'll contact them on my next visit... Also, three months ago, the wolf demon delivered a message."</p><p>The serpent demon produced a yellow talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He immediately took the talisman and used his spiritual sense to examine it.  It was indeed a secret message from Mo Xingdao.</p><p>The message contained only one piece of news: Hong Yuzi, after decades of seclusion, had recovered from his injuries and soon after resuming his activities began preparing various magical treasures and talismans.  Mo Xingdao judged that within three years, he would return to investigate the Jushan altar again!</p><p>"Three years..."</p><p>Qin Sang looked thoughtful.</p><p>It was said that Hong Yuzi's previous injuries were extremely severe.  Truly worthy of being a celestial official of the Dao Court, he recovered after only forty years of seclusion.</p><p>Without the *Poison God Canon*, Qin Sang's strength would be significantly weaker, forcing him to act cautiously. Now, however, his options were far greater.</p><p>His previous plan with Mo Xingdao was for Mo Xingdao to stall Hong Yuzi, buying Qin Sang time to cooperate and gradually explore the path to ascension.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation speed far exceeded expectations, so the plan needed to be adjusted to gain greater advantages.</p><p>They could even consider helping Mo Xingdao escape control, thus placing the initiative in their hands.</p><p>Qin Sang crushed the talisman and paced back and forth, assessing his strength. Although Hong Yuzi was a high-ranking celestial official, with advance planning and utilizing the terrain of the altar to his advantage, Qin Sang believed he might succeed.</p><p>He estimated he should be able to integrate the seventh seal within three years, but the timing was inconvenient; he had intended to visit Mirror Terrace Temple after integrating the seven seals.</p><p>A single attempt at the Floating Pagoda might not be successful, and even if he gained some opportunity, he wouldn't be able to digest it quickly.</p><p>More importantly, he needed to explore the altar before Hong Yuzi acted, aiming to delve deeper and be able to deal with the changing situation calmly.</p><p>He could only postpone that matter.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, immediately took out a talisman, wrote a coded message, and commanded, "Take this to the wolf demon quickly."</p><p>The serpent demon responded, not daring to be negligent. After Qin Sang left, it immediately used its demonic wind to fly towards the Jushan altar.</p><p>Qin Sang travelled south, entering the Star Island Celestial Lake and finding numerous cultivators gathered at the border.</p><p>These cultivators were disciples sent by various sects, guarding the border to prevent demonic gods from causing chaos and attracting the Ghost Fang army.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly passed through the defenses, first visiting Sword Heart Island to see the Sword Master, deliberately suppressing his aura to avoid being too conspicuous.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang stayed on Sword Heart Island a little longer, asking the Sword Master for advice on swordsmanship and practicing with him several times.</p><p>He needed to quickly master the sword technique obtained from the sword dao legacy; each increase in strength would mean a greater chance of success.</p><p>After leaving Sword Heart Island, Qin Sang visited Master Qi on Pot Island and received a second message.</p><p>This letter was from Master Gu.</p><p>Over the past forty years, Master Gu had sent two letters, both containing her insights gained from comprehending the Broken Drum, written in code.</p><p>This was their agreement.</p><p>Repairing the Broken Drum required Qin Sang's personal involvement, and Master Gu could only assist Qin Sang wholeheartedly and share her findings.</p><p>The insights included Master Gu's understanding of the art of refining weapons, making it a treasure for any refiner.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang was not focused on weapon refining at the moment; he glanced through it and stored it away for now.</p><p>After several days of discussions with Master Qi, he brought out his accumulated demonic corpses to re-refine his gauntlets and the Returning Wind Armor.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Returning Wind Armor did not achieve a qualitative change; the two treasures only received some enhancements.</p><p>Feeling the pressure of time, Qin Sang almost immediately returned to his cave to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>During this seclusion, Qin Sang put everything aside and focused on comprehending the *Seven Master Buddha Seals*.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang visited the serpent demon temple periodically to exchange messages with Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Three years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>On this day, Qin Sang did not stay in his cave; he went deep into the altar alone, passing through one illusion after another.</p><p>Near the White Stone Altar and the border of the Demonic Origin, two figures flew swiftly – Hong Yuzi and Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao lagged slightly behind, watching Hong Yuzi's back, his eyes flickering.  He had been confined to the Dao Court and was unsure if there would be other helpers.</p><p>He only hoped that there was only Hong Yuzi; if it was only him, he and Qin Sang might have a chance to escape.</p><p>After flying for some distance and passing a narrow valley, Hong Yuzi looked down, his gaze fixed. He shook his head and sighed softly, "These demons are becoming increasingly rampant."</p><p>Mo Xingdao looked in the same direction.  He saw a statue in the valley, and some ghostly people and spirits were prostrating themselves in worship.</p><p>A demon god dared to build a temple so close to the Dao Court.</p><p>...</p><p>Shortly after they left...</p><p>On the border between the Ghost Fang nation and the Demonic Origin, in a mountain cave, a beautiful woman was cultivating in seclusion.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of light flew into the cave, a voice saying, "They've moved."</p><p>The woman's eyes widened, and a beautiful smile curved her lips.</p><p></p>
