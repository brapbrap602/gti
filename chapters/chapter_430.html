<h1>Chapter 423: Cultivation</h1><p>“A treasure of heaven and earth!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, knowing that Cloud Traveler's hidden injuries required a heavenly treasure-level elixir. He was once again on the move for healing and hurriedly asked, “Senior, what is your current cultivation level?”</p><p>Li Yufu said with a relaxed expression, “Grand Master's cultivation has reached perfection. Three years ago, when he left seclusion, he was already at the Pseudo Core Formation realm. Grand Master originally wanted to come and talk to you personally, but it seemed urgent and he left in a hurry, so he could only send me as a representative."</p><p>Hearing this news, Qin Sang was shocked.</p><p>Twenty-eight years ago, Cloud Traveler had just broken through to the middle stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Now he had actually surpassed him, reaching the Pseudo Core Formation realm first!</p><p>Could it be that Cloud Traveler's talent was comparable to Senior Qingzhu who cultivated the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture"?</p><p>Of course, the biggest hurdle was Core Formation. Countless geniuses were trapped before this hurdle, unable to make any progress their entire lives!</p><p>This was the advantage of having high talent. Cloud Traveler was able to establish his foundation at the age of one hundred, so his talent went without saying.</p><p>If not for the restrictions of his hidden injuries, it was hard to imagine what astonishing achievements Cloud Traveler would have made!</p><p>He himself cultivated the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture" painstakingly, aided by the Killing Talismans, yet he still couldn't catch up.</p><p>Interrupting his cultivation after breaking through to the Pseudo Core Formation realm and diverting his attention to other matters, Cloud Traveler's premonition might very well come true. His hidden injuries would greatly impact his Core Formation.</p><p>Otherwise, knowing Cloud Traveler as he did, he would definitely be able to endure the loneliness and cultivate in seclusion until he formed his core.</p><p>"Important matters take precedence!"</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand dismissively, "When you see your Grand Master after returning to your sect, tell him to send a message if he needs any help."</p><p>He was no longer the inexperienced youth he once was. Facing the Night Devil again, he had some power to maneuver and wouldn't be as helpless as last time.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Li Yufu shook his head slightly and said, "Master Uncle, Grand Master instructed me to deliver the Harmony Pill to Master Uncle and then go to the Cloudmire for training."</p><p>Cloudmire?</p><p>The Cloudmire now was not what it used to be. Describing it as a dragon's pool and a tiger's den wouldn't be an exaggeration.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned upon hearing this and asked, "Does your Grand Master have any arrangements for you?"</p><p>Li Yufu answered honestly, "Grand Master told me to act together with several fellow disciples to familiarize myself with the Cloudmire, and leave future matters to my own discretion."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. Li Yufu was already a Foundation Establishment cultivator. He needed to forge his own path to achieve something.</p><p>Cloud Traveler must have had this purpose in mind, so he decided to let go.</p><p>How much fortune Li Yufu could obtain depended on his own opportunities and abilities.</p><p>Having guessed Cloud Traveler's intentions, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't rashly interfere. After thinking for a moment, he took out a pair of twin swords from his Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>Although the quality of these twin swords was only high-grade, the blades contained Cold Gold, making them no less than top-grade magical artifacts. They were one of Qin Sang's proud creations, kept in his possession specifically for gifting.</p><p>Not to mention his relationship with Su Mingyue, Cloud Traveler treated Li Yufu as a direct disciple, making these spirit swords a worthy gift.</p><p>Li Yufu took the twin swords, his excitement overflowing, "Thank you, Master Uncle!"</p><p>"Go," Qin Sang didn't keep Li Yufu any longer, "The situation in the Cloudmire is becoming increasingly chaotic, remember to be careful... I estimate that it won't be long before I'm also summoned by the sect to enter the battlefield. We'll meet again then..."</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't speaking empty words. The situation in the Cloudmire was growing more and more tense.</p><p>The Small Cold Region and the Heavenly Firmament Alliance hadn't openly fallen out, but small-scale battles continued, with casualties on both sides, and the hatred between them deepened.</p><p>In recent years, Shaohua Mountain's Foundation Establishment disciples were either sent to guard Hanging Skull Pass or summoned to the Cloudmire.</p><p>Qin Sang had also received several letters from the sect.</p><p>Fortunately, with Qi Yuanzhu's mediation, Qin Sang used the excuse that he was at a critical juncture in his breakthrough, delaying it until now.</p><p>It probably wouldn't be delayed much longer.</p><p>After sending Li Yufu off, Qin Sang couldn't wait to return to his cave and take out the Harmony Pill.</p><p>Holding the crescent moon-white elixir in his fingertips, Qin Sang smelled the rich fragrance, his mind intoxicated!</p><p>The Harmony Pill's efficacy was also strong, but it was inferior to the Profound-Veined Harmony Pill in one aspect. If the pill was ineffective for Qin Sang, the medicinal power couldn't be used to enhance his cultivation, and he could only watch helplessly as it was wasted.</p><p>It concerned his own foundation, so even if the entire Harmony Pill was wasted, it was worth it!</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and swallowed the elixir!</p><p>As the elixir entered his belly, Qin Sang's heart became as still as water, slowly refining it.</p><p>The cave was exceptionally quiet, Qin Sang like an ancient pine, motionless.</p><p>After a long time, a long sigh suddenly echoed in the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang had woken up from his meditative state at some point, opening his eyes and staring blankly at the cave walls.</p><p>The effect of this Harmony Pill was less than half of the previous Profound-Veined Harmony Pill.</p><p>Most of the pill's power was wasted.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this, and he couldn't help but feel a little sad.</p><p>But recalling Cloud Traveler's repeated failures, his unwavering Dao Heart despite repeated defeats, Qin Sang banished those distracting thoughts, his expression returning to calmness.</p><p>Slowly exhaling a turbid breath, Qin Sang entered meditation once more, his mind sinking into his Primordial Spirit space.</p><p>On the Ebony Sword, three and a half Killing Talismans shone brightly, continuously absorbing spiritual energy and enhancing Qin Sang's cultivation.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang's cultivation speed actually slightly surpassed that of a cultivator with three spiritual roots!</p><p>Previously, he had only refined the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom, and the two bottles of Dragon Departure Pills were still unused.</p><p>After his breakthrough, he had cultivated diligently for another seven years.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, in another ten years or so, he would be able to catch up to Cloud Traveler and begin preparing for Core Formation!</p><p>Qin Sang's greatest hope was that the Small Cold Region and the Heavenly Firmament Alliance could continue to exercise restraint, at least until he reached the Pseudo Core Formation realm.</p><p>Unfortunately, things rarely went as planned.</p><p>Three months after entering seclusion, Qin Sang held a letter from the sect, his expression helpless.</p><p>The letter was written by none other than Qi Yuanzhu himself and delivered by messenger.</p><p>It ordered Qin Sang to put aside all matters at hand, regardless of whether he had broken through, and return to the sect in the near future to await instructions.</p><p>The wording of the letter was stern, leaving no room for Qin Sang to object.</p><p>In order to delay, Qin Sang had been suppressing his true cultivation level and hadn't reported it.</p><p>Just a few months ago, he had discussed this with Li Yufu, and unexpectedly, his words had come true, as he was now summoned by Qi Yuanzhu.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of betraying Shaohua Mountain. Although he was neither loved nor favored within the sect, he enjoyed the freedom and lack of restrictions.</p><p>He could also seek help from the sect when encountering difficulties, so why not stay?</p><p>Since he didn't intend to betray them, he could only obey.</p><p>Qin Sang reviewed his cultivation and all his magical artifacts.</p><p>He wasn't worried about the dangers of the Cloudmire. As long as he didn't encounter a Core Formation cultivator from the Heavenly Firmament Alliance, he could come and go freely.</p><p>He was just afraid that the sect's affairs would be burdensome and affect his cultivation.</p><p>He hoped that the task Qi Yuanzhu assigned would be relatively easy.</p><p>Qin Sang vacated his cave, transferring the ownership of the 'Sword Pavilion' shop to Ning Youwei, and left Azure Sun Market alone.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang turned around and took a deep look towards the Azure Sun Devil Sect and Boundless Valley.</p><p>He hadn't touched the peak Demon Spirit stage Flood Dragon for the time being, as he wasn't confident enough to extract its essence.</p><p>Failing to obtain the Flood Dragon essence would mean all his efforts were in vain.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to return after reaching the Pseudo Core Formation realm.</p>
