<h1>Chapter 2103: The Blood-Stained Ceremony</h1><p>The three major sects’ actions, exposed in plain sight, caused a significant drop in their reputation, making the dissolution of the Three Teach Alliance inevitable.  Even if the Eight Scenic Views Sect and the Ganlu Zen Monastery don't completely collapse, their recovery will be arduous.</p><p>This is no longer the lower realm where controlling the resources of a fairy palace ensures lasting prosperity and stability.  All clans and sects are now beholden to Qin Sang's will. Unless Qin Sang changes his view of them, they will remain suppressed, giving other sects a chance to rise. This ebb and flow will inevitably lead to the decline of the Eight Scenic Views Sect and the Ganlu Zen Monastery.</p><p>It all depends on whether the Heaven Hao Tower can survive this ordeal.</p><p>Everyone looked towards Old Demon Ku Rong.</p><p>Old Demon Ku Rong, possessing remarkable composure, remained calm in the face of Old Demon Fan's accusations.  "The position of sect leader belongs to the most capable. I haven't used any underhanded tactics to suppress the Grand Elder. This was a normal internal competition within the sect. Grand Elder, don't let resentment cloud your judgment and lead you to falsely accuse me.  Dragging me down with you benefits neither the Fan family nor the sect; it only pleases our enemies."</p><p>Then, Old Demon Ku Rong bowed slightly to Qin Sang.  "Great Real Person, please allow me to report that long before the attack in the North Sea, I secluded myself with the two sect masters to refine a treasure to counter the might of the Changyou Clan's leader. After more than a decade of seclusion and painstaking effort, we have made significant progress. The treasure is almost complete; it only needs a period of refinement before it is perfected. This is the treasure; the two sect masters can testify…"</p><p>He opened his palm, revealing a small golden seal.  The seal bore no inscription, but golden lines on its surface twisted and writhed ceaselessly, seemingly on the verge of forming actual characters.</p><p>Many secretly admired Old Demon Ku Rong's skill as a master of the demonic path; he had foreseen defeat and prepared accordingly, distancing himself from the blame.  His words framed Old Demon Fan's accusations as revenge. His later mention of the Fan family sounded both like a threat and a promise—if Old Demon Fan accepted responsibility, he would protect the Fan family.</p><p>Before Qin Sang, openly promising anything to Old Demon Fan was impossible; this was the best Old Demon Ku Rong could do.</p><p>Old Demon Fan, however, seemed not to understand, or perhaps he no longer cared, letting out a chilling laugh. "You are the sect leader of the Heaven Hao Tower. Without your involvement, how could the Three Teach Alliance follow my orders?  To know the truth, simply ask the cultivator surnamed Hong."</p><p>The latter half of his statement was directed at Qin Sang.</p><p>Old Demon Fan had clearly given up, filled with hatred for Old Demon Ku Rong.  "My current plight is entirely your doing!  You think you can escape?  I'll have company on the road to the Netherworld, haha…"</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Seeing Old Demon Fan, nearly insane and irrational, Old Demon Ku Rong felt his situation had become extremely difficult.</p><p>The response of the cultivator surnamed Hong sealed Old Demon Ku Rong's fate.</p><p>It turned out that after allying with the Dragon King, the cultivator surnamed Hong had informed Old Demon Ku Rong.  However, Old Demon Ku Rong hadn't explicitly responded, and some time later, Old Demon Fan had approached him, clearly with Old Demon Ku Rong's tacit approval.</p><p>At this point, Old Demon Ku Rong could no longer maintain his composure. He cried out, "Great Real Person, please don't believe the slanders of this villain! I…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were deep and cold. Before Old Demon Ku Rong could finish, several chains burst from the clouds, striking him.</p><p>Old Demon Ku Rong was undoubtedly a demonic genius, rarely matched in the Storm World, and one of the most promising candidates to break through to the Transcendent Void stage. Killing him was a waste.</p><p>However, the cultivation world was never short of geniuses.  Wasn't the Dragon King, with his higher cultivation, even more valuable?</p><p>In Qin Sang's eyes, they were no different from ordinary Metamorphosis Stage cultivators.  He held the main altar, Su Nu and others held the three branch altars; everyone else could only manage an ordinary branch altar. A slightly higher or lower cultivation made little difference; there was no need to "consider the overall situation."</p><p>Qin Sang aimed to make an example, to show everyone that betrayal, regardless of strength or status – even as high as the Heaven Hao Tower's sect leader or a Yaozu king – would result in the same consequence!</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Old Demon Ku Rong and the others involved in the Three Teach Alliance's plot were bound and thrown before the main peak, awaiting punishment.</p><p>Silence fell upon the crowd, broken only by Old Demon Fan's maniacal laughter.</p><p>But the reckoning was not yet over.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the seat of the Canglang Sea, Bao Xi turned, nodded to those behind him, and a masked figure flew out, kneeling before the main peak, removing the bronze mask to reveal a young, handsome face.</p><p>A middle-aged cultivator from the Central Plains delegation's eyes narrowed at the sight of the young man, a sense of foreboding washing over him.</p><p>The youth, his face etched with grief, repeatedly kowtowed.  "My name is Yue Yi, from the Yue family of the Canglang Sea. My father and several elders answered a call to aid our northern sea allies, but were ambushed and massacred by villains.  Over a hundred members of my family were slaughtered, and our ancestral home plundered. My father rushed back upon hearing the news, only to be ambushed and murdered on the way by the same villains, fearing retribution. I beg the Grand Master to see justice done!"</p><p>"Do you know who the perpetrators are?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"It is he!"</p><p>The young man pointed at the middle-aged cultivator, his eyes blazing red.  "He learned of our family's treasured Cangbi Jade and demanded it from my father.  When my father refused, he acted out of spite and murdered us to steal the jade!"</p><p>A murmur rippled through the crowd surrounding the middle-aged cultivator.  This man was an elder of the Lingweng Sect of the Central Plains, a once-respected sect, though not among the top-tier schools. That such a respected figure would commit such a heinous act – murder and theft – was shocking.</p><p>Someone in the audience recalled that the Lingweng Sect possessed a cultivation technique that required a specific spiritual artifact, and the Cangbi Jade fit that description.</p><p>"Lies!"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator slammed his hand on the table, vehemently denying the accusation. "I have done no such thing! I implore the Grand Master to judge fairly!"</p><p>"The Cangbi Jade is still on him. It's uniquely shaped, with a mark my father inscribed using a secret technique. It would take at least a year for anyone else to remove it."</p><p>The youth's method of verification stunned the cultivator. Suddenly, he felt a tightening sensation, his storage device flying out on its own. The protective enchantments shattered, revealing its contents—a fish-shaped jade, bearing the described mark.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's face turned ashen. The Lingweng Sect Master rushed forward. "This was his own doing, with accomplices he gathered himself. The Sect knew nothing of this; otherwise, I would have stopped him. I failed to judge his character, and I accept full responsibility. We will compensate the Yue family for all their losses…"</p><p>"Our allies fought and died at the front lines, while these men hid and plundered! They deserve death a thousand times over!" Qin Sang thundered.</p><p>'Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator and his accomplices were bound in chains and dragged away.</p><p>Several more people stepped forward with accusations.  Those who had pillaged during the northern sea attacks were captured on the spot at Qingyang Temple; those who weren't present also met their end.</p><p>The number of prisoners at the foot of Qingyang Temple's main peak grew, a vast, intimidating crowd including individuals whose displeasure could shake the very foundation of the Storm Realm.</p><p>Finally, the purge ended.</p><p>"The situation demands severe measures! The Jiao Long King, second only to the Glass Fairy in the late Nascent Soul stage, and the Kuru Rong Sect Master, a genius of the demonic path, have acted against the greater good, jeopardizing the Storm Realm.  Justice must be served. I must, with a heavy heart, execute them to serve as a warning!"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was unwavering, forcing those present to bow their heads.</p><p>"These are certainly not all.  Some are well-hidden, others haven't yet had the chance to commit their crimes.  It’s best to learn from this and remain hidden."</p><p>Chains tightened, slowly lifting the prisoners into the air.</p><p>They had clung to a sliver of hope—that Qin Sang might spare them to fight against external enemies.</p><p>But seeing Qin Sang's determination to kill, the approaching death, fear consumed them.</p><p>Some wept, some begged for mercy, some raved like the mad Old Man Fan – a spectrum of human responses.</p><p>Kuru Rong Old Devil and the Jiao Long King were filled with regret. They had been fortunate, brought into the greater world by the Storm Realm; otherwise, ascension might have remained out of their reach.  Their futures seemed bright, even if the Storm Realm were destroyed, they could have escaped to pursue their cultivation.</p><p>But a moment of transgression ruined everything.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A final dragon's roar, abruptly cut short as the Jiao Long King's head was severed. The massive head tumbled to the ground, blood spurting like a fountain.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Simultaneously, the others were beheaded. A pungent smell of blood filled the air, staining the white clouds crimson.</p><p>The Yi Xi lotus bloomed brighter, nourished by the blood.</p><p>That day, Qingyang Temple was awash in blood.  The ceremony became a bloodbath, a human sacrifice.</p><p>Heads rolled, bodies hung swaying in the wind.</p><p>The scene deeply impacted everyone present, leaving an indelible mark of awe and fear.</p><p>The massacre was brutal, yet each individual's crime was clear, the punishment just and fair.  No one could argue with the outcome.</p><p>A mountain wind swept across the clouds.</p><p>Only the wind seemed to remain.  The assembled crowd, gazing at the swaying corpses in the sky, fidgeted uneasily. The ceremony had just begun, and they wondered what else awaited them.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, and flames erupted from the bodies, reducing them to ash. The stench of blood vanished.  Enough of a warning had been given; today was a joyous occasion for the Qingyang Temple, and the corpses couldn't remain hanging in the sky.</p><p>With the ringleaders dealt with, Qin Sang's expression softened.  He said calmly, "Everyone harbors selfish desires, their greed insatiable. The emergence of evildoers is not surprising. What pleases me is that in the face of this calamity, the North Sea cultivators did not flinch. Many cultivators prioritized the greater good—such as the Western Buddhist sects, the Wu clan, some cultivators from the Demon Sea and East Sea, the Four Saints Palace, Unmindful Mountain, Venomous Mountain, Qiongying Sect…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at each in turn, showing kindness.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, Old Man Fang, the Poison King, Sect Master Murong, Feather King, Yuan Zhu, and others all nodded in response.</p><p>The atmosphere gradually eased.</p><p>"As many of you have realized, the Storm World faces not only external threats, but also internal strife. For example, the various schools' lineages, previously limited by the Lower Realm, are incomplete after achieving the Nascent Soul stage. Many of you must be facing the dilemma of broken lineages and a lack of cultivation paths…"</p><p>Qin Sang paused deliberately.</p><p>Those present were intelligent; they grasped his meaning instantly, their eyes brightening.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. "I anticipated this. The enemy’s lineages are complete, while we lack cultivation techniques. Over time, the gap will only widen.  Therefore, before arriving, I specifically searched the Great Thousand World for various cultivation techniques and spells. They may not suit everyone, but they should at least offer some reference and hope.  If time permits, I can also help some of you refine your cultivation techniques…"</p><p>Hearing this, the crowd was overjoyed; their anticipation immediately overshadowed their previous fear.</p><p>They also understood the meaning behind the words "if time permits".</p><p>It seemed Qin Sang would display the collected techniques for everyone to study and practice.  However, changing cultivation techniques would certainly be less effective than asking Qin Sang to help refine their lineage's techniques.  Even if Qin Sang didn't understand their sect's techniques, his insight was unparalleled; simply pointing them in the right direction would make their own refinement much easier.</p><p>The oppressive atmosphere lifted, and the crowd shouted in unison.</p><p>"Thank you, Grand Master, for your compassion! We will pledge our lives to repay your kindness!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly. "It is not for me, but for yourselves. The Storm World is our shared home. I want to see it thrive, and I'm sure you all feel the same. We can discuss other matters later. The immediate priority is to repel the enemy. I have some ideas. After the ceremony, please stay, sect masters. I have something to discuss."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to Li Yu Fu, stepped aside, and observed the ceremony from the edge of the altar.</p><p>After the turmoil, the Qingyang Temple disciples, having witnessed their ancestor's might and authority, were elated and their morale soared.</p><p>Even the mundane ritual chants, recited by them, carried an earth-shattering momentum.</p><p>The guest seating area was noticeably less crowded.  Seeing the empty seats, those remaining felt a chill, sat up straight, and patiently observed the ceremony.</p><p>The ceremony followed a fixed ritual. Li Yu Fu led the Qingyang Temple disciples, proceeding flawlessly. Even into the night, no one grew impatient.</p><p>Finally, the ceremony ended.  Instead of leaving, the attendees stayed, finding temporary lodgings with the Qingyang Temple disciples.</p><p>The various sect masters, along with Old Man Fang, Yuan Zhu, and others, were invited to the Yingke Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang awaited them on Yingke Peak.</p><p>"Yuan Zhu pays his respects to the Grand Master." Yuan Zhu bowed.</p><p>"My friend, no need for such formality. We haven't seen each other for over a thousand years. Looking back, it seems like a dream. Our reunion is a fortunate event indeed," Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>Yuan Zhu felt the same.</p><p>Years ago, he and Qin Sang had nearly perished at the hands of the Nine-Phoenix King, their situation dire.  They could never have imagined achieving such success.</p><p>Once everyone was seated, Qin Sang returned to the main seat, surveyed the crowd, his gaze less sharp than before.</p><p>"My earlier words were not an exaggeration.  Even with a plan, I cannot guarantee complete success. My first priority was to find a refuge. You can choose talented disciples to send there. If the worst happens, at least a spark of our heritage will remain.”</p>
