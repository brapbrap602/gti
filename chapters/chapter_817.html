<h1>Chapter 809: The Enemy</h1><p>He looked around. There were no islands nearby to offer refuge. He immediately activated his talisman.</p><p>The next moment, the storm hit.</p><p>Qin Sang was like a ghost, swaying in the violent wind and rain.</p><p>There was no telling when the storm would subside. Qin Sang braved the elements and continued forward.</p><p>Spirit Turtle Island was located near a mid-sized island called Barren Island. There were also dozens of smaller islands nearby, but they were all very barren, unworthy of the attention of high-level cultivators.</p><p>According to the information Qin Sang had gathered on his journey, the sects in this area were not powerful. The strongest sect was called the Vast Sea Sect, and its leader was only at the Core Formation stage.</p><p>Qin Sang had been mentally rehearsing how to meet the Spirit Turtle Island Master.</p><p>Having come this far, regardless of whether the island master was Senior Qing Zhu or not, a visit was necessary.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wouldn't act rashly. He planned to conceal his cultivation level, spend some time around Spirit Turtle Island, learn about the Island Master's deeds, and thereby judge his character.</p><p>Cultivator Wang only knew about this person from rumors; only the residents of the surrounding islands knew the details.</p><p>Finally having news of Senior Qing Zhu, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel apprehensive.</p><p>But overall, he was full of anticipation. Senior Qing Zhu was a true sword cultivator. From the two letters he left behind and his past deeds, one could discern some of his character.</p><p>Thinking of these things, Qin Sang set his sights on Barren Island and flew against the wind.</p><p>The storm intensified, and the surroundings were pitch black. Qin Sang flew alone for a while, then suddenly stopped, as if he had heard something.</p><p>Qin Sang listened carefully, discerning an unusual sound from the chaos, and abruptly changed direction.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang saw a wooden ship about to capsize.</p><p>Gale-force winds, monstrous waves, and torrential rain battered the ship.</p><p>The wooden ship was on the verge of collapse. A protective barrier, clearly formed by a spirit array, shimmered around the ship, but for some reason, it was already fragmented, flickering and about to extinguish.</p><p>Parts of the ship exposed to the storm looked fragile and severely damaged.</p><p>The ship was listing heavily and seemed about to capsize.</p><p>Qin Sang's sharp eyes noticed that there were still survivors on board. After a moment of contemplation, he flew directly towards the wooden ship.</p><p>As he approached, he could see more clearly.</p><p>Several people were running on the deck, their faces filled with panic, like headless flies. They weren't mortals, but their cultivation levels were low, only at the Qi Refining stage.</p><p>These people were clearly trying to repair the spirit array, but they didn't know how. Some had broken down, crying out in despair. Without the protection of the ship and the spirit array, these Qi Refining cultivators had little chance of surviving the storm.</p><p>"Quick! Put all the spirit stones in! Third Junior Brother, go to the cabin and see if Master has woken up!"</p><p>A young man in white tried to suppress his panic, frantically attempting to repair the spirit array. Unfortunately, his cultivation was insufficient, and despite his best efforts, he couldn't make any progress.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A huge wave several meters high crashed down.</p><p>The protective barrier dimmed again. The ship's hull, though not completely broken apart, was badly damaged, creaking and groaning everywhere.</p><p>Just as everyone fell into despair, a strange figure suddenly appeared on the deck.</p><p>They thought they were hallucinating. Looking closely, they realized it was a young man who looked even younger than them, but his expression was far calmer, and his aura was no weaker than their Master's.</p><p>"Who are you? Are there only a few of you on board?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, frowning.</p><p>He himself looked somewhat disheveled because he had disguised himself as a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>The young man in white saw Qin Sang. After a brief moment of joy, he remembered his Master was seriously injured and unconscious. Fearing that this newcomer had ill intentions, he felt a mix of relief and worry, yet he dared not lie.</p><p>However, dying at the hands of this person was no different from dying in the storm.</p><p>He remained relatively calm and shouted, "Reporting to Senior, this junior is a disciple of the Three Mountains Sect. We are traveling with our Master. When the storm hit, our ship was suddenly attacked by a sea beast, damaging the spirit array. Master repelled the sea beast but was seriously injured and fell unconscious. This junior implores Senior to save our lives!"</p><p>Qin Sang swept the area with his divine sense and found a seriously injured middle-aged man, a Core Formation cultivator, in the cabin. He flashed inside.</p><p>The young man in white and the others were startled and quickly ran in after him.</p><p>They saw Qin Sang holding their Master's arm, seemingly checking his injuries.</p><p>Everyone held their breath.</p><p>The man was seriously injured, his internal organs damaged. Qin Sang took out a healing pill and put it in his mouth. The pill took effect immediately, and the man slowly regained consciousness, though still weak.</p><p>The young man in white and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>"Thank you, fellow Daoist, for saving our lives..."</p><p>The man saw the stranger Qin Sang, startled at first. After his disciples explained what had happened, he tried to force himself up to express his gratitude.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand to stop him. "Fellow Daoist, your injuries are severe. You need to rest for a while to recover. The wind and waves are high outside, and the ship is about to capsize. I was on my way to Barren Island when I encountered the storm and wanted to take shelter on the ship. Please tell me how to control the spirit array so I can repair it."</p><p>A short while later, Qin Sang returned to the deck, took out some spirit materials, and easily restored the spirit array.</p><p>The protective barrier recovered, blocking the storm.</p><p>The ship was finally spared from the onslaught and pulled back from the brink of capsizing. The young man in white and the others, having narrowly escaped death, obeyed Qin Sang's every word, repairing the damaged parts of the ship.</p><p>Once the ship was stable, Qin Sang instructed the others to steer the ship and returned to the cabin to talk with their Master.</p><p>"My surname is Wu. I was originally a rogue cultivator. I took in a few incompetent disciples and called ourselves the Three Mountains Sect. We have been cultivating on a small island near Barren Island. I went out on a mission this time, but unexpectedly encountered several calamities and almost died here. It's fortunate that Fellow Daoist Qin arrived in time and saved our lives..."</p><p>Sect Master Wu's complexion improved somewhat, and he asked curiously, "Fellow Daoist cultivates on Barren Island? We haven't met before, have we?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I am not a cultivator from Barren Island, but a rogue cultivator who has been traveling around. I once searched for renowned sects and families, but unfortunately, my talent is limited, and I wasn't accepted. I happened to hear a rumor that there was a senior near Barren Island who opened a dojo to lecture and guide rogue cultivators, so I came here to seek apprenticeship."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist is looking for the Spirit Turtle Island Master?"</p><p>Sect Master Wu exclaimed, a strange look flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Seeing his unusual expression, Qin Sang's heart tightened, and he asked anxiously, "What? Is the rumor false?"</p><p>Sect Master Wu shook his head. "The rumor is true. To be honest with Fellow Daoist Qin, I was also a rogue cultivator from elsewhere. I learned that the Island Master Senior was giving lectures and was drawn here. I received his guidance and benefited greatly. Later, I had another opportunity and successfully formed my core. However... Fellow Daoist is late."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned upon hearing this. "Has that senior left?"</p><p>"Not left."</p><p>Sect Master Wu sighed deeply, his eyes filled with deep hatred, gritting his teeth. "It's that senior's enemy who came looking for him! The Island Master Senior had lived in seclusion here for two hundred years, but his enemy wouldn't let him go, chasing him here and razing Spirit Turtle Island to the ground. The Island Master Senior's life or death is unknown!"</p>
