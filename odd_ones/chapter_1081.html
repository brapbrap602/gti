    Watching the last Void Duke get turned into a patty by the
            Mechanical Deity, Han Xiao finally heard the soothing notification
            sound from the interface.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    In the past ten days or so, he had been taking Ames around to look
            for other Void Dukes for partnerships. He had been active in the
            various edge areas of the Void Dimension.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Since not everyone wanted to hire outsiders, the two of them wasted
            some time in between. However, overall, the mission was completed
            quite efficiently. As long as a partnership was agreed upon, Han
            Xiao would easily be able to wipe out the hostile Void Duke’s
            forces.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “It’s finally completed.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao deactivated the Mechanical Deity and opened the interface
            to look at the reward.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The bonus from [Void Conqueror] was already in effect. His various
            void-related talents were all slightly enhanced. He received 1,600
            Free Attribute Points and one God’s Trait Transformation Point, as
            well as +20 starting Favorability with all void creatures. He also
            received a Legendary Point [Void Celebrity]. Its introduction was
            that the name ‘Black Star’ was now well known between the void
            creatures.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    As usual, he stocked the Free Attribute Points up, of which he now
            had close to 4,000. As for the God’s Trait Transformation Point, Han
            Xiao continued on the path of maxing one path first, so he used it
            on [God’s Trait Transformation—Machinery] and unlocked the level
            four bonuses.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">

   <p class="calibre5">
    Stage Four: +3 Levels to abilities belonging to the [Apostle
            Mechanic] and [Emperor Mechanic] stages. +25% base success rate of
            inventing blueprints. +15% base success rate of improving
            blueprints. +3% base success rate of inventing Grade Gold
            blueprints. +1.5% rate of acquiring unique talents. +15% abilities
            of the sub-branches.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    _____________________
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Not bad.” Han Xiao scanned through it.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The class abilities of the Apostle and Emperor stages were very
            crucial, so enhancing them was quite useful. According to the
            current trend, Han Xiao estimated that the next level would most
            likely enhance the abilities of the Lord and Throne Mechanic stages,
            which were even more crucial.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Overall, the bonuses of this level were mainly focused on enhancing
            his ability to innovate. After all, Han Xiao had no channeling bars
            like the players. At his level, innovating new blueprints from his
            class knowledges was common, same with improving the base quality of
            blueprints. The blueprints he used often nowadays were all enhanced
            and improved versions.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    What Han Xiao was more concerned about was the unique talent. It
            seemed like those old men like Manison and Sorokin all had their own
            unique talents. Since the players did not have this in his previous
            life, Han Xiao had no idea about how to acquire them, nor did the
            interface give any tips. Therefore, he could only figure it out
            himself.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    As for the enhancements of the sub-branches, they enhanced Han
            Xiao’s Armed and Energy Branch abilities, basically almost all the
            Mechanic abilities not belonging to the Virtual Branch.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao was still looking at the interface when his current Void
            Duke partner finished consuming the enemy’s core and came to beside
            him.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Black Star, a Void Lord under the command of His Excellency Kasuyi
            wants to see you.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Finally, I knew he wouldn’t ignore my actions.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao had expected this, so he was not surprised. Following the
            Void Duke’s arrangements, he met with the Void Lord.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Void Lord’s body was enormous and seemingly extended from the
            ground right into the clouds. Its body’s color was deeper than even
            the Void Duke.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    As soon as he saw Han Xiao, he felt close to him for some reason he
            could not explain. Somehow, Han Xiao looked very easy to befriend.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Despite the rather good first impression this Void Lord had of Han
            Xiao, it did not affect his attitude when carrying out the mission
            for Kasuyi. He directly said, “Black Star, we’ve noticed your recent
            frequent battles in the Void Dimension. Are you planning to rule the
            Void Dukes and build your forces here?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Don’t worry. Tell Kasuyi that I’m just signing contracts with some
            mercenaries and have no plans of building a force. In fact, I’ve
            almost achieved my goal, and I’m planning to leave the Void
            Dimension in just a day or two.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao knew what Kasuyi was worried about, so he expressed that he
            was not there to fight for territory.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “That’s best. As long as you don’t interfere too much with the
            internal matters of the Void Dimension, we will always welcome you.
            Do come to us if you need anything.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Void Lord was quite well mannered. As a subordinate of Kasuyi,
            he had some basic knowledge of the powerful people in the main
            universe. He knew that Black Star was not someone he could mess
            with.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Sure, we might have the chance to do business in the future,” Han
            Xiao said casually.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Kasuyi’s territory had a stable production line that produced all
            kinds of void specialties. It was quite a good business. If he had
            any needs, he would not mind working with him.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This time, the Void Lord took out a tube that was filled with a
            light blue liquid that was giving off a dim light and said, “This is
            master Kasuyi’s special present for you. It’s liquid-form Void
            Essence extracted for the core of the dimension. It’ll help in
            enhancing your void bloodline.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao raised his brows, accepted the tube, and said with a smile,
            “Thank Kasuyi for me.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Clearly, this was meant as a farewell gift to tell him not to stay
            too long in his house. Anyway, Han Xiao never planned to, so he had
            no problem with it.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    After a successful exchange, the Void Lord left satisfied. Han Xiao
            kept the tube too, which would most likely increase the attributes
            he would gain during the next Race Evolution.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Finally done?” This time, Ames giggled.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Over the past few days, Han Xiao had been very occupied with doing
            the mission and did not fulfill his promise to Ames of traveling
            with her. He could not help but feel he had wronged her. Now that
            business was done, with a relaxed mind and mood, he waved and said,
            “Let’s go. I’ll accompany you to travel the secondary dimensions all
            you want.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    …
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    While the two of them traveled the secondary dimensions, the
            situation of the main universe kept changing.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Although the plan of forming a Beyond Grade A Alliance in the
            Flickering World was not publicized yet, the unusual movements of
            numerous peak Beyond Grade As attracted attention from many
            well-informed organizations.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    After the initiators of the alliance gathered, they started the
            first meeting.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Inside the round table conference room of a spaceship, the remote
            projections of the various initiators gathered and sat in their
            chairs. Most of them were peak Beyond Grade As.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    At the huge round table, only one seat was empty. It was Han Xiao’s.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Manison clapped, signaling everyone to look over, and slowly said,
            “Black Star went to the secondary dimensions and isn’t available.
            We’re the only ones attending this meeting today.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “He’s the main initiator. Growing the association needs the Black
            Star Army’s help too. Is it suitable to not call him for such an
            important meeting?” Secret Master asked.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The rest agreed.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Currently, Han Xiao’s position was quite high among the Beyond Grade
            As. Although he did not come, no one could ignore his existence.
            Furthermore, with the irreplaceable importance the Black Star Army
            had in creating the Beyond Grade A Association, the various Beyond
            Grade As present all recognized his significance. Even though he was
            not present, they would still speak for him.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Black Star said himself he isn’t coming.” Manison shook his hand.
            “He has already made his stand. He suggests everyone should focus on
            the agreement we had during the Meeting of the Gods, and once we
            come to a conclusion, just inform him of it.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He would never lie about such things.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Alright then.” The rest nodded.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Let’s talk business,” Manison said slowly. “Since we’re decided to
            form the association, we’ll first have to set down the rules,
            regularize the positions of the association, confirm the nature of
            the organization and its development direction, and decide on the
            laws its members must follow.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Kasuyi followed up and said, “That’s right. Our core goal is to
            unite the strength of all Beyond Grade As, be it now or in the
            future. The Ancient Ones’ structure is too lenient, and its entry
            point is too high, so this time, we can’t repeat their mistakes. We
            must have a clear set of laws and regulations.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    A peak Beyond Grade A said, “According to the proposal Black Star
            gave, the main use of the association is to solve conflicts between
            Beyond Grade As. I think that’s a good path, and it’s best we start
            there. For example, we can have the rule that members can’t easily
            initiate physical conflicts with other members except for the
            purpose of sparring, to maintain the image that the Beyond Grade As
            are united. Also, members shouldn’t be allowed to deliberately
            escalate the conflict and avoid peaceful compromises…”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Everyone started discussing their ideas one after another. The rules
            and regulations were being filled up very quickly.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This time, Sorokin, who was the major investor, suddenly said, “The
            rules are good indeed, but the biggest problem is to make sure the
            Beyond Grade As are willing to follow them. As everyone knows,
            Beyond Grade As all have their own pride and have been enjoying tons
            of privileges. It won’t be easy to make them follow rules.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “That’s right. This is a core problem,” Manison said. “Not only must
            we make sure the members accept the restrictions from the rules, we
            also have to make sure that even after the outsiders see these
            rules, they’ll also still be willing to join the association. Not
            everyone agreed with what we said during the Meeting of the Gods, so
            in order to prevent others from just ignoring us, as usual, it’ll
            all come down to the use of intimidation and benefits. We have to
            let the other Beyond Grade As see the price of disobeying the rules
            while also understanding the benefits of joining the association.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Intimidation is easy. We seniors won’t have to do anything. We’re a
            form of intimidation by ourselves. Benefits, however, must be
            displayed through many aspects. We shall build an interest network
            of Beyond Grade As, unite and share our resources, and provide help
            to each other through many means. As for the new members in the
            future, we can use our resources to help them to build their Beyond
            Grade A forces, as well as provide some guidance from the peak
            Beyond Grade As…
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Also, we can even include the Ultimate Knowledges of the five
            classes as a benefit.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Hearing this, everyone was shocked.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Ultimate Knowledges? This is basically fighting with the three
            Universal Civilizations in the market of recruiting Beyond Grade A
            allies. They’ll definitely object to it to an extreme extent. This
            isn’t a small issue.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Have you forgotten our initial goal so soon?” Manison said slowly.
            “If we can’t break the forced monopoly that the three Universal
            Civilizations have on the Ultimate Knowledges, even if the Beyond
            Grade A Association is formed successfully, it’ll still be
            controlled by the advanced civilizations. We’ll have no choice but
            to continue working for them all the same.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Some nodded in agreement while more stayed silent. They felt that
            this was too big a step and too risky. Opinions were varied.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Since you insist on doing so, the three Universal Civilizations
            will have a lot to say to us,” Kasuyi said with resignation.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Therefore…” Manison looked around and finally showed his true goal.
            “We need a leader. He must be able to take the pressure and never
            compromise, and I’m the only one who is able to take on that
            position.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Everyone glanced at him.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Someone started praising him and said, “Manison is strong. He has a
            lot of connections, a huge organization, and he’s senior. He is
            indeed the most suitable candidate.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Quite a number of people there were invited by Manison, so they were
            going to support him from the beginning.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This time, another peak Beyond Grade A candidate said, “Who doesn’t
            know what you’re planning? We’re all the initiators of the
            association. I think I’m more suitable than you.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Everyone there was a Beyond Grade A. One person speaking for
            everyone was impossible. Even the president would only be taken more
            seriously when it comes to making decisions but could never truly
            order around these people. Most decisions would still have to be
            made together by the elders. However, due to the unique nature of
            the Beyond Grade A Association, this kind of opportunity was
            extremely rare.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This time, Milizaus said slowly, “Although Black Star isn’t here, he
            also intends to be a candidate. The forces the Black Star Army has
            in the Flickering World are unquestionable. Our organization will
            only be truly powerful with him as the president. Furthermore, the
            Evolutionary Totems will soon be sold to the public. At that time,
            Black Star will be much more important to the three Universal
            Civilizations. He’s suitable as the lubricant between two sides and
            will be able to tremendously reduce the pressure the association
            will face… I vote for Black Star as the representative.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao did not join the meeting because he wanted to let others
            settle the issue, but it was mainly because he was not willing to
            face the other candidates directly, including Manison. Since he
            could not compete with the others in terms of connections, all he
            could do was bring up the profit he could bring and let the others
            decide. This way, he would avoid direct conflicts with other peak
            Beyond Grade As. More importantly, he did not want to disrupt the
            Great Director Manison’s plans.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Black Star is indeed very useful, but he’s far from experienced. I
            wouldn’t want a youngster to stand above my head.” Sierron snorted.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Everyone had different people they wanted to vote for, so they
            started arguing. Surprisingly, quite a number of people voted for
            Han Xiao, who was not even here.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    After quite some time, someone said, “I think that the management
            structure should be balanced. The position of the president
            shouldn’t be permanent. They need to be re-elected regularly.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This suggestion was agreed on by most. They only did not want to
            step up now, but it was certain that being the president would be
            beneficial once the association became stable. Also, in terms of
            maintaining balance, no one wished for one person to be the
            president forever.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This time, Manison looked at Kasuyi, who did not participate much in
            the discussion. He narrowed his eyes and said with a deep voice,
            “Vote for me this time. I’ll fully support you in the next
            election.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Hearing this, for some reason, Kasuyi suddenly felt a chill up his
            spine.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Why do I feel like I’ll have to keep my Psychic shield up at all
            times from now on?
   </p>
