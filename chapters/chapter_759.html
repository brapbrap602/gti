<h1>Chapter 751: The Stone Hall</h1><p>Having escaped the Purple Star Eagles, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.  Affected by the poisonous mist within the deadly zone, their strength was limited, making it difficult to deal with such a large flock.</p><p>“Have you noticed? The insect beasts we’ve encountered since entering seem normal at first, but once combat begins, they become frenzied, extremely ferocious, and completely lose their minds.”</p><p>The young man with the sword stared at the spot where the eagles had disappeared, and spoke.</p><p>“Indeed, that's why they're called vicious insects and beasts. Not just here, but all the creatures within the Seven Kill Hall are like this.  Influenced by something unknown, even Nascent Soul ancestors can't unravel the secrets of the Seven Kill Hall. Therefore, everyone must remember to leave before the spirit array collapses.”</p><p>Xiang Yi looked down at the ground, walking around, searching for something.</p><p>The interior of the canyon seemed a different world from the outside.</p><p>Not a single plant could be seen here; it was desolate, covered with hard, sharp rocks.  Everyone proceeded with caution.</p><p>Xiang Yi finally determined their direction.</p><p>The terrain within the canyon was strange. Moving forward, they discovered the path sloped downwards, making them feel as if they were descending from a mountaintop.</p><p>Obscured by the poisonous mist, they could not see the surrounding terrain and could only guess.</p><p>The descent was deeper than they had imagined, seemingly bottomless.</p><p>Vicious beasts still roamed here, and Xiang Yi avoided them whenever possible.</p><p>The poisonous mist grew thicker. Everyone periodically glanced at the Bone Lotus, reassured only when they saw no abnormalities. Currently, only three of its petals had turned purple, leaving them ample time.</p><p>Finally, the downward slope ended.  By now, they had no idea how deep they had descended.</p><p>The surrounding mist enveloped the protective shield formed by the Bone Lotus like a purple curtain, leaving them to rely almost entirely on their hearing to sense any danger.</p><p>Fortunately, they hadn't encountered any beasts adept at ambush.</p><p>After traveling a bit further, Xiang Yi signaled everyone to stop, looked to the left, and sent a wave of true essence.</p><p>The poisonous mist dispersed momentarily, revealing the silhouette of an ancient stone hall within, before quickly closing again.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Xiang, this stone hall is…”</p><p>Seeing Xiang Yi nod, everyone rejoiced; they had finally reached their destination.</p><p>However, they didn't dare relax. The brief glimpse revealed an extraordinary hall, surrounded by ancient restrictions and hidden in the heart of the poisonous mist zone, likely a dangerous place.</p><p>The fact that the Merchant Alliance sent so many people spoke volumes.</p><p>“Don't approach yet. Circle the hall. If there are any vicious beasts nearby, hunt them all down to prevent them from noticing us when we break the restrictions and causing a major problem.”</p><p>Xiang Yi whispered.</p><p>“Are there even stronger beasts inside?” Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>Xiang Yi nodded.  “This appears to be the bottom layer of the poisonous mist zone, but according to the Merchant Alliance's records, there is a bottomless rift ahead, the true core of the poisonous mist zone and its source. Entering the rift, the Bone Lotus would likely be completely contaminated, losing its power. The poisonous mist there is something even Nascent Soul ancestors fear. Moreover, at the bottom of the rift, there may be vicious beasts comparable to transformed demons.”</p><p>Everyone was astonished.  It truly was a deadly zone!</p><p>Without the Bone Lotus, their true essence would quickly deplete if they were exposed to the poisonous mist. Such a dangerous place, and it wasn’t even the core of the poisonous mist zone.</p><p>They began circling the stone hall, searching for beasts.</p><p>They did indeed find two lion-like beasts, which they proactively attacked and killed. After clearing the area, they approached the stone hall.</p><p>Reaching the hall, everyone's expressions turned strange.</p><p>It could hardly be called a hall. It was tiny, only half the size of a room, and perfectly square.  Apart from the ancient restrictions, there were no distinguishing features.</p><p>“Does the Merchant Alliance want us to break the restrictions and enter the stone hall to retrieve a treasure?”</p><p>The Liu couple stepped forward, channeling their true essence to gently touch the ancient restrictions. “These restrictions don't seem too strong. At least for Nascent Soul ancestors, breaking them wouldn't be difficult. This thing stands here, so obvious, it must have been visited countless times by Nascent Soul ancestors. What could possibly be left?”</p><p>Xiang Yi said calmly, “That's all I know. The Merchant Alliance's request is indeed for everyone to cooperate with me in breaking the restrictions and then retrieving something inside. Many secret places in the Seven Kill Hall are like this; it's not just about high cultivation.  Just because Nascent Soul ancestors have visited doesn't mean all the treasures are gone.”</p><p>Xiang Yi then took out eight small triangular flags and distributed them to everyone.</p><p>The eight apricot-yellow triangular flags were identical, their poles shorter than a palm's length.</p><p>Qin Sang took one, recognizing it instantly as a type of restriction-breaking tool. Controlling these flags, the eight of them should be able to break the ancient restrictions.</p><p>“These are Earth Location Flags.  My cultivation is based on earth-element techniques, so I will be the formation's core. Fellow Daoists, please assist.  Pay attention to the formation…”</p><p>Xiang Yi carefully explained the key points of the formation.</p><p>All of them were highly skilled cultivators and quickly grasped the formation. They arranged themselves in front of the ancient hall, with Xiang Yi at the center.</p><p>Xiang Yi held the Bone Lotus in one hand and a triangular flag in the other.</p><p>Once everyone was in position, Xiang Yi nodded slightly and then poured his true essence into the triangular flag with all his might.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The triangular flag instantly grew three meters tall, plunging into the ground.</p><p>Xiang Yi's hand seals changed rapidly, sending a series of incantations into the flag. The flag fluttered, devouring true essence like a bottomless pit.</p><p>As true essence poured in, cloud seals and thunder patterns appeared on the flag, appearing mystical.</p><p>Apricot-yellow light erupted, and the ground began to tremble.</p><p>“Activate the formation!”</p><p>Xiang Yi roared.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others immediately sat down, activating their triangular flags.</p><p>A difference became apparent.  Their flags were a meter shorter than Xiang Yi's, and the cloud seals and thunder patterns on them were less dense.</p><p>However, the yellow light released by their flags was no less intense than the core flag's, and after appearing, it seemed drawn towards the core, converging upon it.</p><p>This made the core flag even more dazzling.</p><p>The earth trembled like a dragon turning over.</p><p>If they hadn't cleared the area beforehand, the surrounding beasts would surely have been attracted.</p><p>A steady stream of earth elemental power was drawn from the earth's veins, merging into the flag formation. A sphere of light formed on the core flag, accumulating terrifying power.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang and the others' true essence was rapidly depleting, and they couldn't move, needing to maintain the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang had taken several pills beforehand and was faring well.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Xiang Yi's eyes widened as he roared.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A blinding flash of yellow light shot out, slamming into the ancient restriction.</p><p>The yellow light enveloped the stone hall, and all they could sense were two immensely powerful forces colliding, neither yielding to the other.</p>
