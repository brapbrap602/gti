Chapter 617: Life-Bound Insect Gu


The Thousand Households Village was surrounded by a river.
This was the largest river in the vicinity, flowing from north to south, known as the Green Robe River.
At night, several boats drifted on the Green Robe River, with skilled guards keeping watch, preventing beasts or enemies from intruding into the Thousand Households Village.
The river Qin Sang had drifted down was a tributary of the upper reaches of the Green Robe River, originating from deep mountain ravines and eventually merging into the Green Robe River. Similar tributaries were countless.
During his drift, Qin Sang was sometimes unconscious and sometimes awake, but he remembered the general direction.
The night dew was heavy and cold, but Qin Sang's physical injuries had recovered, and he could endure it, so he let the Flying Night Devil speed up.
The place where he lost his Spirit Beast Pouch was farther from the Thousand Households Village than he remembered. Qin Sang and the Flying Night Devil stopped and walked, searching for suitable spiritual veins for secluded cultivation as they traveled.
Unexpectedly, this place was far more barren than Qin Sang had imagined. After traveling so far for half the night, they only found a few small, unusable spiritual veins.
Leaving the Green Robe River, villages became increasingly rare, replaced by deep mountains and old forests, devoid of human traces.
Qin Sang carefully discerned the path and found the small river he had drifted down. He flew along the river, and by early morning, he finally arrived near the location where he had lost his Spirit Beast Pouch.
Reaching the puddle, Qin Sang examined it carefully. The beast-skin-clad man had been completely devoured by the Bloodwing Ghost Head Hornets, leaving not even a bone fragment behind.
He searched the surrounding area but found no trace of the Corpse Puppet Pouch.
Qin Sang recalled the events of that day.
Preoccupied with escaping, he hadn't seen where the beast-skin-clad man had thrown the Corpse Puppet Pouch before dying. If it had fallen into the river, it would have been swept into the Green Robe River, making retrieval impossible.
Fortunately, besides the Bloodwing Ghost Head Hornets, there were no other strange insects in the Spirit Beast Pouch, otherwise Qin Sang would have been truly heartbroken.
Unlike the vibrant scene that day, the mountains on both sides of the river were now silent. Not a single bird song, beast roar, or even insect chirp could be heard.
Such an abnormal situation was undoubtedly caused by the Bloodwing Ghost Head Hornets; all life on the mountain had been devoured.
Qin Sang jumped onto the Flying Night Devil, about to track the Bloodwing Ghost Head Hornets' trail, when he suddenly saw a flame-like green light flicker on a mountain to the west, disappearing in a flash. He also faintly heard a few shouts.
"Someone?"
Qin Sang frowned and ordered the Flying Night Devil to carry him into the shadows, stealthily approaching.
"These monstrous bees fear my ghost fire! You two priests, use your insect gu to lure the monstrous bees down, and I'll set them on fire and take the hive."
Three figures gathered in a mountain hollow, concealing their auras as they watched the distant cliff.
Scattered around them were the corpses of two Bloodwing Ghost Head Hornets. Judging by the marks on the bodies, most had been burned to death.
At this moment, a buzzing sound continued from the cliff face, where a large swarm of Bloodwing Ghost Head Hornets still hovered and danced, forming a vast blood cloud. A rough count revealed over two hundred remaining.
They circled the cliff, seemingly protecting something.  A closer look revealed a black, ball-like hive on the cliff face.
The three were unaware that someone was watching them from the nearby woods.
The one who had spoken was a pale young man.
He wore a black robe, with the character "insect" outlined on the back in strange patterns.
Behind him stood three white bone skeletons. Green ghost fire flickered in the skeletons' eye sockets, and transparent silk threads bound their joints, the other ends wrapped around the young man's fingers.
Qin Sang, an expert in corpse arts, recognized at a glance that these three skeletons were bone puppets refined using a corpse art secret technique. Unlike the Flying Night Devil with its powerful physical body, their core lay in the ghost fire within their eye sockets.
This refining method was crude, consistent with the young man's twelfth level of Qi Refining.
The two elderly men beside the young man were also at the Qi Refining stage.
One was at the tenth level, the other only at the ninth.
They seemed to be from the same village, their clothing patterns similar, adorned with beast skins, beast teeth, and other strange decorations, though different in style from the beast-skin-clad man who had died to the hornets.
One wore a crescent moon ornament on his forehead, the other a waning crescent moon.
Could they be the priests of the Skymoon Village, Qin Sang wondered?
The shamanic envoys of these villages had pitifully low cultivation levels. He wondered about the young man's background.
The two priests seemed to be at odds, ignoring each other and chanting spells independently. Then, from their dantians, each released a spirit insect.
One was snake-like, covered in fine, fiery red scales, yet possessing wings and two heads. It was smaller than a human finger, and extremely bizarre.
The other was a beetle, slender with a carapace as thin as a cicada's wing, but which unfolded like a blade.
Qin Sang's spirits lifted as he stared intently at the two spirit insects. He only recognized the beetle, which the Spirit Controlling Sect called the Great Blade Divine Ox. It wasn't considered a rare insect.
It only had the potential for two transformations, but its speed was exceptional, and its sharp carapace was comparable to a magical tool, giving it decent combat power.
That day, when he saw the Jade Mantis emerge from the beast-skin-clad man's qi sea, he'd become curious.
The insect control techniques of the cultivators here were a completely different system from the Spirit Controlling Sect's.
Like the Jade Mantis, these two spirit insects had a unique qi connection with their masters, clearly formed through a life-bound cultivation method.
Could it be that they had refined the spirit insects into life-bound spirit insects?
"Go!"
Following the young man's command, the two elders directed their spirit insects toward the swarm.
The two-headed, winged serpent opened its mouths mid-air, spitting two streams of fire. The Great Blade Divine Ox also spread its wings, unleashing several wing strikes, attracting the swarm's attention before fleeing in separate directions.
'Buzz...'
Enraged, the Bloodwing Ghost Head Hornets split into two groups to give chase. One group, lured by the strange serpent, flew towards the young man.
The young man confidently summoned his three skeletons to meet the hornets, ordering them to spew ghost fire when the swarm arrived.
He expected the hornets to burn to death instantly, but unexpectedly, a blood mist suddenly spread throughout the swarm, devouring the ghost fire. Only the outer layer of hornets burned, while the rest, to the three men's astonishment, swooped down upon them.
"This idiot."
Qin Sang shook his head inwardly.
The Bloodwing Ghost Head Hornets had undergone their transformation in the blood mist of the Bottomless Cliff Valley. Alone they weren't fearsome, but in a swarm, they underwent a qualitative change.
The strange serpent couldn't escape, becoming enveloped by the hornets as it frantically spewed fire in retaliation.
The young man hurriedly continued to urge on the ghost fire, finally rescuing the serpent, which was now covered in wounds and nearly incapacitated.
The elder with the crescent moon ornament on his forehead let out a mournful cry, as if he himself were injured, his aura weakening considerably.
"Truly life-bound spirit insects!"
Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.
When a cultivator's life-bound magical tool or treasure was severely damaged, it would backlash against its owner, similar to what the elder was experiencing.
Seeing the three in disarray, Qin Sang took out two large cloaks, placing one on the Flying Night Devil and then ordering it to attack.
