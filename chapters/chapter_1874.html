<h1>Chapter 1865: The Heavenly Dao's Constant Course</h1><p>Divine Court, Divine Firmament, Talisman Deity…</p><p>Qin Sang marveled at the profound heritage of the Daoist lineage. Although Zuo Zhenren's words contained many ambiguities, through these fragments, Qin Sang could still glimpse the splendor of the Daoists in ancient times.</p><p>Qin Sang's first thought was his earlier speculation about this world. Could a Minor Thousand World truly nurture such a power?</p><p>Yet Zuo Zhenren clearly spoke of 'this world'.</p><p>After listening to Zuo Zhenren's explanation of the Divine Court, Qin Sang fell into deep thought, sorting through these astonishing secrets.</p><p>According to Zuo Zhenren, the Ghost Fang Kingdom's demonic cultivators modeled their demonic techniques after Daoist techniques. Both demonic and Daoist techniques were rooted in Talisman Dao. The Divine Court and the Talisman Deity were the materialized true meaning of Talisman Dao, the foundation upon which a cultivator's Dao Foundation rested.</p><p>In the present age, the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi ran rampant, yet the Divine Court's whereabouts remained unknown.  The connection between techniques and the Divine Court, as well as the Talisman Deity, had weakened, resulting in unstable Dao Foundations for cultivators. By the Grand Master and Demon King realms, relying solely on techniques proved insufficient in power.</p><p>The Divine Court's power was channeled through various administrative altars and the Merit Seal.</p><p>This led to two consequences.</p><p>First, before cultivators broke through to the Five Talismans Realm, they had to visit a True Monarch. The True Monarch would empower them with the Merit Seal's strength, granting them greater protection. This was essentially 'inscribing their name' on the Merit Seal. The Dao Court referred to this as 'Ascending to Truth'.</p><p>Only after Ascending to Truth could one enter the Five Talismans Realm and become a Grand Master.</p><p>Therefore, the number of Grand Masters in the Daoist lineage was fixed, determined by the refinement level of the Merit Seal.  It wasn't a breakthrough just anyone could achieve.</p><p>One could judge this by the size of an administrative region.  The territory of an administrative region was the boundary of the Merit Seal's power. The vaster the territory, the closer the Merit Seal was to completion.</p><p>Second, Grand Masters had to cultivate within the Merit Seal's range. Straying too far from the administrative altar would still impact their Dao Foundation. The celestial phenomena triggered by a Grand Master's travels were not a good sign. The farther from the altar, the more violent the phenomena.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang could already guess Zuo Zhenren's intentions.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren, by explaining so much, willing to divulge the secrets of this world to an outsider like himself, likely wanted him to help the Daoists reclaim the Divine Court.</p><p>His performance during the fight with Ling You Wang had clearly caught Zuo Zhenren's eye. At full strength, he could at least hold off a Demon King.</p><p>Moreover, as long as there was sufficient Wood Spiritual Qi, he dared to charge into battle regardless of the consequences. It was hard to find a more valiant general than himself.</p><p>It wasn't surprising that Zuo Zhenren was trying to recruit him.</p><p>"Are these contributions of mine still insufficient to exchange for the qualification to Ascend to Truth?" Qin Sang asked, frowning.</p><p>"The merit of slaying a Demon King is certainly enough, but Fellow Daoist is not a member of our Daoist lineage… and whether or not one can Ascend to Truth requires an audience with a True Monarch, for the True Monarch to decide," Zuo Zhenren paused, then spoke frankly, "If Fellow Daoist can help the Daoists reclaim the Divine Court, your merit will be unparalleled. Ascending to Truth would be no problem."</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze passed through the golden-armored warrior and landed on the meditating Zuo Zhenren. He hesitated, "I believe I can't hide it from Senior's discerning eyes. What I rely on is actually a Daoist technique. It requires a specific environment, otherwise…"</p><p>The golden-armored warrior chuckled, interrupting Qin Sang, "Among our fellow Daoists, there is no shortage of True Monarchs skilled in Five Elements Talisman techniques.  Our forces also include Wood-type spirit creatures. Creating a Wood Spiritual Domain for Fellow Daoist is a simple matter. Wood Spiritual Qi will be yours for the taking!"</p><p>Qin Sang let out an "uh." He was accustomed to fighting alone, overlooking the difference between battlefield厮杀 and ordinary duels.</p><p>Daoist talisman techniques were the most suitable divine abilities for battle formations. With the cooperation of troops, Zuo Zhenren's words were not unfounded.</p><p>It seemed Zuo Zhenren was determined to win him over.</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent again, pondering Zuo Zhenren's words.  Based on his own experience, the so-called Six Heavens' Ancient Qi mainly affected True Essence and Nascent Soul.</p><p>He didn't cultivate Talisman Dao, merely utilizing techniques to stabilize his True Essence. His Dao Foundation had no connection to the Divine Court. After breaking through to Void Refinement, would the impact on his Dao Foundation still be so significant?</p><p>Techniques could already communicate with the Divine Court, drawing upon its protection.  A Void Refinement cultivator's control over True Essence and Heavenly Yuan Qi far surpassed that of a Nascent Soul cultivator. As long as he didn't stray far from Daoist territory, perhaps he could cultivate normally without needing to 'Ascend to Truth'.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren also mentioned the threat of restless Divine Generals was greater than disordered True Essence.  He had the Jade Buddha and didn't need to worry about that at all.</p><p>If Qin Sang's deductions were correct, perhaps he wouldn't need to seek the Dao Court, and thus wouldn't need to risk being drawn into the vortex of conflict between the two major powers.</p><p>In the presence of a Grand Master, Qin Sang could feel an invisible pressure, urging him to be cautious.</p><p>Facing a True Monarch directly, he feared being seen through at a glance, with nowhere to hide.</p><p>Of course, all these considerations were based on the premise that he would break through to Void Refinement in this world. If he could find the path to ascension beforehand, he wouldn't need to worry at all.</p><p>Seemingly perceiving Qin Sang's thoughts, Zuo Zhenren reminded him, "Fellow Daoist shouldn't think that not being a member of our Daoist lineage, not cultivating our scriptures, grants you an exception.  Over the years, among the sects within the Ju Shan administrative region, there's been no shortage of exceptionally talented individuals, and in the end, they all sought the Dao Court…"</p><p>Zuo Zhenren paused here, as if the following words were too important, and he hesitated.</p><p>Finally, he made up his mind, "The so-called Six Heavens' Ancient Qi also refers to the Heavenly Dao. The explanation about True Essence and Nascent Soul is to enlighten younger generations while preventing them from being shaken by the truth of this world. It's a conventionally accepted, relatively reasonable explanation… Fellow Daoist, make an oath first."</p><p>The golden-armored warrior fell silent, his gaze burning as he watched Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, knowing he was about to touch upon the true secret. He immediately swore a Heart Demon Oath, vowing never to divulge it.</p><p>Having decided, Zuo Zhenren no longer hesitated, "Cultivating to the Profound Clarity Realm, Fellow Daoist should be able to perceive the importance of the 'Dao'. Cultivating the Dao, seeking the Dao, are not empty words. As the saying goes, Heaven and Earth mingle, all things refine and mature. The Heavenly Dao has its constant course, evolving all things; if the Heavenly Dao falls into disorder, what then?"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang's face immediately revealed a look of shock. He abruptly looked towards the exit of the administrative altar and said in a deep voice, "Like those ferocious beasts?"</p><p>"Precisely like those ferocious beasts! With the Heavenly Dao in disarray, how can we cultivate the Dao?" The golden-armored warrior nodded heavily, posing a counter-question.</p><p>"The Divine Court can pacify the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi and stabilize the four directions and eight extremes. What it stabilizes is the Heavenly Dao, the Great Dao!"</p><p>"Our ancestors, when discussing the Dao, once said: Without accumulating meritorious deeds, one cannot reach the profound realm. Without aiding those in distress, the Dao Fruit is difficult to achieve! The Divine Court, when first established, was called Thunder City, revering Thunder techniques…"</p><p>Speaking of this, the golden-armored warrior's voice suddenly rose.</p><p>"What are Thunder techniques? Wielding thunder in one's palm, summoning wind and rain before one's eyes, acting as Heaven's mouthpiece, benefiting all beings, a treasure for all time!"</p><p>The words were resounding and awe-inspiring, echoing in Qin Sang's heart for a long time.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren remained seated, the golden-armored warrior expressionless. But when these words were spoken, Qin Sang could sense an extraordinary radiance, a transcendental air, emanating from them!</p><p>"The Daoists created the Divine Court, established administrative altars, refined the Merit Seal, and passed down techniques. One of their aspirations was to pacify the孽原, restore a clear and bright world, free of ghost people and ferocious beasts, a world worthy of being called a Great Creation. It is said that once a Merit Seal reaches completion, within its administrative region, the Heavenly Dao will follow its constant course, impervious to the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi.  It's a pity…"</p><p>Zuo Zhenren sighed, falling silent, then continued with a hint of hope, "With the return of the Divine Court, we, inheriting the Dao lineage, may one day achieve the aspirations of our predecessors."</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to scratch his head. Zuo Zhenren had said a lot, yet concealed even more, and clearly wasn't prepared to offer detailed explanations.</p><p>The Divine Court could stabilize the Heavenly Dao. What level of grand divine ability was that?</p><p>Such grand ambition, such a high realm… If it were said the Daoists had once produced Celestial Masters, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.</p><p>Such a powerful ancient Daoist lineage, why had it fallen to this state?  Why had the Divine Court crumbled?</p><p>Could there be even more terrifying enemies within the孽原? Had the Dao Court been defeated, never to recover?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the legends of the ghost creatures within the孽原. He had entered the孽原 many times to hunt demons, strictly adhering to warnings, never venturing too deep, never personally witnessing those诡异莫测 ghost creatures.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Although there was no wind, the canopy behind Qin Sang shook violently, leaves rustling and falling.</p><p>The floating island beneath him, the entire space, the entire administrative altar, was trembling.</p><p>A leaf landed on Qin Sang's shoulder, jolting him awake. He glanced outside the illusion.</p><p>Unlike the previous burst of golden light, besides the tremors, there were no other unusual phenomena. The source of the tremors couldn't be accurately perceived, only that they originated from the depths of the administrative altar.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren also couldn't say for sure whether the tremors were caused by the battle between the two sides or the emergence of the Divine Court.</p><p>"Having delayed for so long, we're probably too late now, aren't we? Also, does Zhenren know where the Divine Court is?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't directly agree or refuse.</p><p>He had been in the secluded valley at the bottom of the blue sea of light when the Southern Heaven Gate appeared, completely unaware of it.</p><p>"We do what we can and leave the rest to fate," Zuo Zhenren sighed softly. "Those demons are clearly prepared. I only hope our fellow Daoists won't fall too soon, that they can hold the demons at bay.  A divided rule is also勉强 acceptable. If that's the case, there will inevitably be another battle at the Divine Court. Let us quickly recover our strength. We might still make it in time."</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang learned the location of the Divine Court from the golden-armored warrior and was immediately startled.</p><p>The Divine Court was actually in the direction of the crimson-gold spiritual needles!</p><p>"Is this a coincidence, or…"</p><p>Qin Sang had a bad feeling, but knowing so little, with so many tangled threads, he couldn't sort it out.</p><p>He couldn't help but worry. The Divine Court could potentially affect the path to ascension. If the passage between the two worlds were destroyed, he would only have one choice left – to rely on the Daoists.</p><p>Even if Zuo Zhenren hadn't invited him, Qin Sang would have gone to take a look.</p><p>Moreover,  he dared not take Zuo Zhenren's discourse on the Heavenly Dao lightly, even if he didn't completely believe it.</p><p>Unless he could ascend, remaining in this world meant bearing the consequences of a disordered Heavenly Dao, being led astray. How could he then speak of pursuing the Great Dao?</p><p>Taking precautions was imperative.</p><p>He would assess the situation when the time came.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang agree, Zuo Zhenren was overjoyed. His tone lightened, "Does Fellow Daoist Qing Feng still wish to use these merits to exchange for cultivation opportunities first?"</p><p>Qin Sang said in a deep voice, "The essentials of cultivation, and the steps to Ascend to Truth, neither can be lacking!"</p><p>Only with the ability to break through bottlenecks did one qualify to Ascend to Truth.</p><p>Qin Sang believed the former was more important.  If Zuo Zhenren was exaggerating the danger, he would know once he broke through to Void Refinement.</p><p>The golden-armored warrior nodded. "In that case, this humble Daoist also has some insights into the Five Talismans Dao. If Fellow Daoist trusts this humble Daoist, I can offer you some guidance now."</p><p>As the saying goes, techniques should not be imparted lightly.  Zuo Zhenren wouldn't offer guidance for free; Qin Sang still needed to exchange it for merit.  But he could transmit the teachings first, and discuss the reward later at the Dao Court.</p><p>This was a clever move, seemingly a gesture of goodwill, and he wasn't afraid Qin Sang wouldn't be able to repay him.</p><p>But Qin Sang's heart stirred. Zuo Zhenren had fought alongside him and presumably had some understanding of him.  Guidance from Zuo Zhenren would be most suitable.</p><p>Regardless, he would secure the benefits first.</p><p>"Please, Senior, instruct me," Qin Sang said respectfully, bowing deeply, ready to listen attentively.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Zuo Zhenren's eyelids twitched slightly. He suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze filled with divine light, and looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if his mind had been struck by a heavy hammer.  His expression remained unchanged, but his heart tensed.</p><p>Under Zuo Zhenren's gaze, Qin Sang felt as if his Bright Mountain Armor had been removed, as if he were being seen through.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren slowly said, "Regardless of what technique Fellow Daoist cultivates, to seek the Great Dao, one must emulate Heaven and Earth, achieving unity of Heaven and Man. The Five Talismans barrier also lies in this. Over the years, the Daoist predecessors have summarized some key points, which can be considered shortcuts. As for their effectiveness, it varies from person to person…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression became even more respectful. He listened as Zuo Zhenren revealed the true words, "If one enters the Dao through the Five Elements, these two paths are supreme:  Choose one and refine it, purify it, or possess all five elements, balanced and unbiased."</p><p>With each word Zuo Zhenren spoke, his divine sense transmitted Dao Rhymes, profound and mystical, beyond words.</p><p>Therefore, although it was a simple sentence, the profoundness within it was beyond the imagination of ordinary people.</p><p>Qin Sang remained stunned for a long time, struggling to digest these words. With the experience of breaking through to Nascent Soul, he had previously had some speculations, but they weren't systematic.  Zuo Zhenren's guidance pointed directly to the key.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Qin Sang would choose the second path.</p><p>He possessed Five Element Spiritual Roots and could be said to have all five elements, but balancing the Five Elements was by no means something achievable simply by having Five Element Spiritual Roots.</p><p>How to regulate the Five Elements couldn't be fully explained in a few words, nor was it something that could be accomplished overnight.</p><p>For a time, Qin Sang couldn't fully comprehend it. He memorized it roughly, intending to slowly contemplate it later.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could fully grasp these true words, Zuo Zhenren carefully examined him again, then continued, "One must know that technique cultivators and physical cultivators are different."</p><p>Qin Sang quickly regained his focus and listened attentively.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren had clearly seen that he cultivated both techniques and physical strength. Qin Sang hadn't expected Zuo Zhenren to be so generous, willing to guide him on the path of physical cultivation as well.</p><p>Although Qin Sang's Dao Foundation wasn't in physical cultivation, knowing this would still greatly benefit him.</p><p>"Physical cultivators, at the Profound Clarity Realm, will use their own Yuan Essence as the foundation, evolving an internal world. This humble Daoist has seen in scriptures the concept of Internal Scenery and External Scenery, corresponding to the Profound Clarity and Five Talismans Realms…"</p><p>Zuo Zhenren paused, as if recalling and pondering, "Both emulate Heaven and Earth, pursuing unity of Heaven and Man.  We manipulate Yuan Qi, controlling Heaven and Earth, while physical cultivators pursue the concept of 'I am Heaven and Earth'.  The so-called External Scenery is continuously absorbing the power of Heaven and Earth into the body, strengthening the internal world, until it reflects outwardly, influencing Heaven and Earth. The demonic cultivators' Dharma Forms are a manifestation of 'External Scenery'…"</p><p>Zuo Zhenren spoke more about physical cultivation.</p><p>Seemingly explaining in more detail, it was actually less profound than before, but it was enough to guide Qin Sang.</p><p>As the saying goes, a true transmission in a single sentence is worth ten thousand scrolls.</p><p>Perhaps Zuo Zhenren was holding something back, but none of these words were false. With Qin Sang's current cultivation, he could judge for himself.</p><p>His previous doubts were resolved, and Qin Sang suddenly felt a sense of clarity, having found the direction for his future cultivation, although it wasn't entirely clear yet.</p><p>"This is a huge favor!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, filled with pleasant surprise.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren was so forthright. Even if he had ulterior motives, Qin Sang had to acknowledge his gratitude. It wasn't simply a fair trade.</p><p>At least, in this Divine Court conflict, he couldn't simply be a spectator.  When the time came, he would have to act.</p>
