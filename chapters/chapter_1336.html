<h1>Chapter 1328: The Foul Land</h1><p>Qin Sang and Lu Boyuan huddled together, and through his introduction, met several unfamiliar desert cultivators.</p><p>Qing Jun stood aside, intently watching the swirling fog, lost in thought.</p><p>Five days passed in a flash.  No newcomers appeared after that.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced casually at the Xiaohan Domain cultivators nearby. They were to cooperate with the Tongyou Demon Lord and the demon clan to investigate another forbidden area.</p><p>When his gaze swept over Dongyang Bo, Dongyang Bo noticed it, raising his head to meet Qin Sang's eyes.  As if knowing what Qin Sang was thinking, Dongyang Bo curled his lips into an amused smile.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze turned cold, then he looked away.</p><p>For twenty years, Dongyang Bo had been surprisingly quiet, seemingly having forgotten about Qin Sang seizing his Nascent Soul puppet and severely injuring him. Perhaps he was wary of his own strength, fearing repercussions for Shaohua Mountain, and had decided to swallow his pride and let it go.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't care about his thoughts. Dongyang Bo posed no threat to him. If Dongyang Bo dared to make a move, the Nascent Soul puppets he'd already subdued would certainly give him a huge surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang was thinking about something else.  Based on information he'd received and what Dongyang Bo had said, Chen Yan's last attempt to rescue her master had likely failed.</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had sold herself to become a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but Chen Yan's true purpose was to rescue her master at all costs, showcasing the profound depth of their bond.</p><p>Given Chen Yan's personality, even with only a one in ten thousand chance, she would never give up.  But since she left, she hadn't appeared, even when the Ziwei Palace appeared last time.  And now, with the imminent opening of the Immortal Gate, Chen Yan still hadn't returned.</p><p>Chen Yan was a heaven-born cultivator with a spiritual root, a Nascent Soul cultivator two hundred years ago; her current cultivation must be far beyond what it once was. Even if she hadn't broken through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, recruiting a few helpers shouldn't be difficult, right?</p><p>Had she given up on saving her master, or had something unexpected happened?</p><p>…</p><p>The Sin God Palace.</p><p>Musty, lifeless.</p><p>A faint, ghostly light flickered in the darkness, illuminating a figure seated cross-legged beside the sealed ancient prohibition. This person, like an ancient bell, had been sitting here for countless years, motionless, blending seamlessly with the shadows.</p><p>Ye Laomo, sensing the fluctuation from the sealed ancient prohibition, awoke from his meditative state, slowly opening his eyes.</p><p>For over twenty years, he hadn't moved a step. His wounds had long healed.  He glanced around him.</p><p>The core crystal of the Youjing Tower floated nearby, slowly rotating around him.  But the Nascent Souls were gone.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it became clear that each crystal ball imprisoned a tiny figure – the Nascent Souls, including Tian Zheng Lao Ren!</p><p>Fine chains bound their limbs and necks.  Their faces lacked malice; they were vacant, their eyes lifeless, clearly having lost themselves. Trapped in the crystal balls, they showed no signs of struggle.</p><p>Ye Laomo's gaze shifted, finally settling on the central crystal ball.  Tian Zheng Lao Ren's Nascent Soul was imprisoned within.</p><p>Ye Laomo looked deeply at him, then spat out a mouthful of refined blood.  He manipulated his spiritual sense, conjuring a remarkably complex blood soul curse, which instantly entered Tian Zheng Lao Ren's forehead.</p><p>Tian Zheng Lao Ren's face contorted in pain.  Exhausted from years of struggle against Ye Laomo, he had little strength left to resist. The last vestiges of his clarity were swallowed by the blood soul curse, plunging him into deep despair, completely under Ye Laomo's control.</p><p>A ghostly fog suddenly emerged from the crystal ball, transforming into countless ghostly figures that clawed and lunged at Tian Zheng Lao Ren, finally coalescing into chains that bound him tightly.</p><p>Seeing this, Ye Laomo breathed a sigh of relief. He hadn't expected the old man to be so difficult to deal with.</p><p>The other Nascent Souls quickly crumbled, exploited by Ye Laomo, and refined into the crystal balls.  Only Tian Zheng Lao Ren, still recovering from his wounds, continued to fight desperately in the face of his predicament; his resolve was unwavering, without flaw.  This, coupled with Ye Laomo's own injuries, had dragged things out until now.</p><p>"The Ziwei Palace is about to appear! Release me quickly! Otherwise, it'll be too late!"</p><p>A scream echoed from beneath the seal.</p><p>Ye Laomo glanced at it indifferently. This demon, desperate to break free, pulled this stunt every few years.  He wouldn't believe it, of course.</p><p>With a series of flashes, Ye Laomo moved to the edge of the forbidden area, gazing into the depths of the Sin God Palace.  He saw the celestial omen and a flash of surprise and eagerness crossed his eyes.</p><p>The time had come!</p><p>"Throw down the jade bone! Quickly!"</p><p>The demon screamed, even more impatient than Ye Laomo. The jade bone had been placed by Ye Laomo on the edge of the ancient prohibition.</p><p>Hope of freedom was within reach, after twenty years of watching helplessly, a true torment.</p><p>This time, Ye Laomo didn't hesitate, grabbing the jade bone and throwing it into the seal.</p><p>A幽光 erupted, finally revealing the seal's full appearance.</p><p>The place was unusually empty, surrounded by a swamp.</p><p>The swamp was filled with mud and filth.</p><p>A stone path led through the swamp, ending at four stone pillars.</p><p>Each pillar was dozens of meters tall, imposing and magnificent, their bases firmly planted in the swamp, forming the seal.</p><p>A muddy pool between the pillars churned, revealing a small opening – the source of the demon's voice.</p><p>Ye Laomo's figure flickered, splitting into four, each flying towards a pillar.</p><p>He had remained on the path, afraid to touch the swamp.</p><p>The filth possessed corrosive power; the trapped demon suffered unspeakable torment.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The four figures formed a complex seal, simultaneously pressing their hands against the pillars.</p><p>The seal trembled.</p><p>*Glug glug…*</p><p>The jade bone sank into the swamp.</p><p>A maniacal laugh echoed from the depths.</p><p>Suddenly, waves of mud surged, a nauseating stench filling the air.</p><p>From the churning mud, a grey shadow emerged – a skull.</p><p>The moment the skull appeared, the seal reacted violently.</p><p>After countless years, the pillars still emanated an astonishing power.</p><p>Ye Laomo's expression changed; gritting his teeth, he activated the seal, shaking the foundation.</p><p>The seal's power lashed out at the shadow like spiked whips, striking the skull repeatedly.</p><p>*Crack crack crack…*</p><p>The demon screamed, the skull charging towards the jade bone, cracking as it neared destruction.</p><p>As the skull shattered, a soul escaped, narrowly diving into the jade bone.</p><p>The seal's power pursued, even more ferocious.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The jade bone's surface ripped open, damaged beyond repair.</p><p>The jade bone emitted explosive sounds.</p><p>It was incredibly strong, but without swift escape, it would share the skull's fate.</p><p>幽光 flowed over it, countless strange runes flickered, then erupted with a powerful aura.</p><p>Two soulfires ignited in its empty sockets, pulsating fiercely.  The jade bone, now possessed, let out a piercing shriek and soared into the sky!</p>
