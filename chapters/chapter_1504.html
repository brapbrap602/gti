<h1>Chapter 1495: Bitter Battle (4k)</h1><p>Liuli closed her eyes tightly.</p><p>Tong Lingyu had determined that Liuli could influence Yin Changsheng's control over the Fourfold Coiling Serpent Seal, but it was only a deduction. She could not offer any further guidance, and Liuli had to figure it out on her own.</p><p>In an instant, Liuli activated the Treasure Manipulation Incantation, and indeed sensed the connection between herself and the spirit treasure.</p><p>This sensation was several times clearer than before her Ice Soul Divine Light had reached great completion!</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light, one of the pinnacle divine abilities of the Dao of Frigid Ice.</p><p>The Fourfold Coiling Serpent Seal was also a spirit treasure of this kind.</p><p>Mysteriously, Liuli seemed to feel a flicker of spirituality rejoicing within the spirit treasure.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The main body of the Fourfold Coiling Serpent Seal disappeared from everyone's sight.</p><p>In its place was a faint, eerie blue light that shrouded the area above.</p><p>At this instant, the thirteen ice mirrors of the Fallen Serenity Divine Restriction were also completely obscured by the radiance of the Fourfold Coiling Serpent Seal.</p><p>The eerie blue light shifted and changed, appearing somewhat ethereal, rising and falling, extremely illusory, like flames dancing above a sea of fire, full of a dreamlike quality in its movements.</p><p>To the naked eye, it looked like a tragically beautiful cold flame, extremely pure and intoxicating.</p><p>But hidden within this beautiful scenery was a murderous intent.</p><p>The hisses of the Coiling Serpent echoed from within the cold flame, one after another, the piercing and sharp sounds seeming to originate from the mouths of true ancient divine beasts, traveling through countless years to pierce the minds of their opponents.</p><p>Hearing this sound would awaken a primal fear originating from instinct.</p><p>Within the layers of cold flame, a massive figure occasionally appeared, sometimes a long tail covered in scales, sometimes a giant head, with huge, bell-like eyes shooting out fierce rays.</p><p>The Coiling Serpent swam within the cold flame, never revealing itself for too long, always flashing past and immediately disappearing into the depths of the cold flame.</p><p>These fleeting glimpses only served to intensify the fear of their opponents.</p><p>In some legends, the Coiling Serpent was revered as the God of Fire.</p><p>Although this was not spirit fire, nor was it truly a cold flame, but rather an anomaly formed by extremely dense cold energy, and the Coiling Serpent was merely a manifestation of the spirit treasure.</p><p>But this scene was not much different from the legends.</p><p>The might of the spirit treasure was fully displayed!</p><p>Under the influence of the cold flame, the entire underground cavern was extremely frigid, the cold air manifesting into substance, turning the cavern into a vast expanse of white.</p><p>Strangely, the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool showed no signs of freezing over; the blood in the pool became even more vivid, and the speed at which the blood threads spread also increased.</p><p>'Hiss… hiss…'</p><p>The hisses grew more and more urgent.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was extremely grave.</p><p>A ray of sword energy leaped from his fingertip.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword flew out of the Thousand Jun Ring, its blade flashing, and hovered above Qin Sang's head, pointing remotely at Yin Changsheng. It seemed to also sense the pressure from the spirit treasure, its blade trembling slightly, emitting bursts of sword cries.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced out of the corner of his eye at Liuli beside him, seeing her eyes tightly shut, concentrating on activating the Treasure Manipulation Incantation to control the spirit treasure. She had even retracted her Ice Soul Divine Light, and it seemed unlikely that she could spare any attention for a short time.</p><p>He knew too little about spirit treasures and had no confidence. He wasn't sure how long Liuli needed to prepare, or how much influence she could exert on Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>An extremely ear-piercing hiss came from mid-air, and it was clear that there was more than one!</p><p>At the same time, the cold flame frantically condensed inward, revealing two thick, long serpentine shadows.</p><p>Two Coiling Serpents intertwined with each other, cold flames flickering in their fierce eyes, their killing intent fully revealed, staring at Qin Sang. They bathed in the cold flame, using it as wings, their slender bodies suddenly swaying.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A bone-chilling wind blew towards them.</p><p>The cold wind struck the stone walls of the cavern, producing a series of 'bang bang' sounds, and the walls were instantly covered in frost, a crystalline expanse.</p><p>In an instant, the figures of the two Coiling Serpents vanished into thin air.</p><p>Through the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang saw the illusory forms of the Coiling Serpents riding the fire, charging towards him at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Each Coiling Serpent was smaller in size than when Tong Lingyu had controlled them, yet Qin Sang felt a profound sense of crisis.</p><p>"Two!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils contracted, his gaze becoming solemn.</p><p>He had a premonition that if he used the Seven Slaughtering Souls Formation to resist head-on, even if he could preserve his own life, Liuli would undoubtedly die.</p><p>He made a decisive decision!</p><p>Lightning flashed behind Qin Sang, the Phoenix Wings spread wide, and his arm swiftly wrapped around Liuli's slender waist. Without a moment to savor the softness, his figure immediately transformed into a bolt of lightning, abruptly rushing out.</p><p>The instant Qin Sang activated his lightning escape technique.</p><p>The void twisted, and the heads of two Coiling Serpents suddenly emerged, their mouths filled with fangs.</p><p>At this critical moment.</p><p>Liuli's eyelids trembled slightly.</p><p>A trace of confusion suddenly appeared in the eyes of one of the Coiling Serpents, its head stiffening slightly, causing its movements to slow by half a beat.</p><p>However, the other Coiling Serpent was unaffected, ferocious and menacing, opening its bloody maw and fiercely pouncing towards the bolt of lightning that Qin Sang's escape light had transformed into.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The lightning flickered, breaking through the air.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's figure appeared on the other side of the cavern, his feet landing on the ground, his figure staggering slightly, almost crashing into the stone wall.</p><p>His face was pale, his eyes filled with a hint of terror, as he glanced at the protective barrier around him. Merely being grazed by the Coiling Serpent had caused cracks to appear in the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel's barrier.</p><p>"Hehe, not a bad escape technique…"</p><p>Yin Changsheng's mocking laughter came from within the ice coffin.</p><p>His attack had missed, but Yin Changsheng did not show any anger, instead his tone carried a sense of enjoyment from toying with his opponent.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was finally able to confirm that Yin Changsheng's mind had definitely been eroded by the evil technique.</p><p>It was impossible for such a tyrant to develop this kind of thought at this critical moment when his scheme was about to succeed, and to express it so clearly.</p><p>However, this was not enough to improve their current situation.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang felt gusts of cold air, and discovered that the figures of two Coiling Serpents had appeared out of thin air on either side, blocking their retreat from both left and right.</p><p>Cold winds surged wildly in the cavern.</p><p>The two Coiling Serpents watched them menacingly, cold flames surging, boundless cold intent converging towards Qin Sang's location.</p><p>An invisible pressure enveloped his entire body.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that something was wrong, his expression changing drastically, and he was about to act.</p><p>Just then, one of the Coiling Serpents suddenly raised its head, emitting a piercing shriek, its entire body convulsing, falling into confusion.</p><p>"It worked!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart rejoiced. He looked down and saw Liuli's face flushed, her breathing rapid. Without hesitation, he immediately took Liuli and fled far away.</p><p>"Yin Changsheng, you plotted so meticulously, but you didn't expect that Liuli could make the Fourfold Coiling Serpent Seal acknowledge her as its master, did you?" Tong Lingyu's laughter was weak but unrestrained.</p><p>"Seeking death!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng tried, but he couldn't immediately eliminate Liuli's interference. He immediately urged the other Coiling Serpent to pursue and kill them.</p><p>Affected by Liuli, the power of the Fourfold Coiling Serpent Seal was greatly diminished, but it was still astonishing.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang discovered another problem. As time passed, under the influence of the spirit treasure, the temperature of the cavern continued to drop, and the void seemed to be freezing.</p><p>If not for Liuli's help, in less than an instant, he would be as if frozen in ice, severely restricted!</p><p>'Hiss… hiss…'</p><p>The sound of the Coiling Serpent came from behind.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have time to think, silently activating the sword formula.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword trembled, its blade reversing, and a ray of sword light swiftly slashed out. At the same time, the Golden Sinking Sword split into thousands, brilliant as stars, and then vanished into thin air, the Seven Slaughtering Souls Formation reappearing.</p><p>At this moment, the illusion here became completely different from other places.</p><p>The vast white cold air was dispersed by the sword formation, turning into a gloomy darkness. Invisible sword threads moved, rapidly surging towards the Coiling Serpent.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>That ray of sword light was instantly shattered.</p><p>The Coiling Serpent roared and charged out, colliding head-on with the sword formation.</p><p>In an instant, the sword formation and the power of the spirit treasure collided with a heaven-shaking force.</p><p>The sword threads were endless, dense and packed, forming layer upon layer of sword nets, extremely sharp and swift, strangling the Coiling Serpent.</p><p>The Coiling Serpent remained fierce, unyielding, its body merging with the cold flame, surging like a tide, layer upon layer counterattacking. One sword net after another was annihilated within the cold flame.</p><p>The aftershocks spread, impacting the ancient restriction.</p><p>The cavern shook repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped his lightning escape, staring intently at the center of the collision. He calmed the rapid breathing within his body, not daring to hesitate, and fully activated the sword formation.</p><p>Facing such a terrifying impact, the sword formation was on the verge of collapse, but it did not directly crumble.</p><p>Although the Seven Slaughtering Souls Formation was no match for the Fourfold Coiling Serpent Seal, it already had the power to resist!</p><p>The Coiling Serpent was blocked by the killing formation, emitting a furious roar.</p><p>It suddenly stopped attacking, its head raised high, its giant eyes emitting a fierce light, firmly locking onto Qin Sang, its mouth opening wide, the cold flame all over its body converging towards its mouth.</p><p>Seeing this scene, a great alarm rose in Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>The Coiling Serpent's movements were incredibly swift, the cold flame rapidly condensing into a giant fireball in its mouth. Its body dissipated with the wind, merging with the cold flame, and in a roar, it shot out!</p><p>'Zila!'</p><p>This ball of cold flame directly charged into the Seven Slaughtering Souls Formation.</p><p>The sword threads melted on contact with the cold flame.</p><p>An astonishing scene unfolded, the cold flame actually forcefully carved out a path within the sword formation, shooting towards Qin Sang. Fortunately, the sword formation was not completely powerless, weakening the power of the cold flame and slowing its speed.</p><p>Qin Sang did not hesitate, grabbing Liuli and flashing away from his original spot.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Cold mist surged.</p><p>Like a dragon turning over, the cavern shook violently.</p><p>The ground was directly blasted into a deep pit by the cold flame, covered with a thick layer of ice. The scattered cold flame converged in the pit at a visible speed, forming the outline of the Coiling Serpent.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared not far away.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword followed its master closely.</p><p>Its main body was not damaged. Qin Sang took a deep breath, and once again activated the sword formation, standing in front of him, fully alert.</p><p>If Liuli could continuously restrain the spirit treasure, he could indeed hold on.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Liuli's breathing became increasingly rapid, but her true essence consumption was not that intense, making it difficult to directly assess her condition. Her struggle with Yin Changsheng for control of the spirit treasure seemed to be a contest on another level.</p><p>He just didn't know how long Liuli could hold on against an opponent two realms higher than her.</p><p>As soon as this thought flashed through his mind, the Coiling Serpent arrived again.</p><p>Qin Sang skillfully controlled the sword formation to entangle with the Coiling Serpent, circling around the cavern.</p><p>Seeing that he couldn't take down Qin Sang in a short time, Yin Changsheng finally became impatient, letting out an angry snort.</p><p>This seemingly ordinary snort sounded like thunder in Qin Sang's ears, and his expression changed.</p><p>He faintly felt a nameless danger, and without the slightest hesitation, his divine sense swiftly surged out, forming a thick barrier of divine sense in front of Liuli.</p><p>The instant the barrier formed.</p><p>The void in front of Liuli twisted, and a transparent, sharp cone appeared out of thin air.</p><p>The fluctuations emitted from the cone were completely different from other Dao techniques and divine abilities. It was a pure fluctuation of divine sense, arriving in an instant, formless and intangible, impossible to defend against.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't reacted quickly, Liuli's primordial spirit would have suffered severe damage at this moment.</p><p>"A secret technique of divine sense attack!"</p><p>A gleam flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>His divine sense far surpassed that of cultivators of the same level, but unfortunately, he lacked such secret techniques, and could not unleash its overwhelming effect. If he were to create his own, he would have no reference, and it would inevitably consume a great deal of energy and time.</p><p>Great cultivators in the late Nascent Soul Stage indeed rarely had weaknesses, and Yin Changsheng was also proficient in secret techniques of divine sense.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had been prepared for this, and had been paying attention to Liuli while controlling the sword formation.</p><p>He knew that Liuli was the breakthrough point, and Yin Changsheng would definitely not let her go.</p><p>The cone was blocked by Qin Sang's divine sense barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed Liuli and retreated.</p><p>Strangely, his divine sense did not feel any pain. Although Qin Sang's divine sense was not weak, this simple and crude defensive method was certainly no match for Yin Changsheng's secret technique of divine sense.</p><p>Just then, an unexpected event occurred.</p><p>A transparent, fine needle suddenly appeared at Qin Sang's glabella, flashing and disappearing.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's true target was actually Qin Sang!</p><p>However, if Qin Sang had not chosen to protect Liuli, the cone would have followed the momentum and turned from illusory to real, severely injuring Liuli. No matter what Qin Sang did, one of them would be injured.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Qin Sang's figure swayed, and he let out a muffled groan. Blood threads appeared at his seven apertures, his eyes turned red, and his breathing became rapid.</p><p>This was naturally a deliberate act by Qin Sang.</p><p>No matter how strong Yin Changsheng's secret technique of divine sense was, it could not harm his primordial spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang had cultivated to this day, and was already extremely skilled in such matters, his acting skills were superb.</p><p>The Jade Buddha must not be exposed, it might be the key to turning defeat into victory.</p><p>With this thought in mind, Qin Sang had been doing his utmost to persevere from the beginning, facing several life-threatening situations, almost sacrificing his external body and the Sun Divine Tree, but he forcefully endured.</p><p>Because the pressure brought by Yin Changsheng was too great, he had been unable to find an opportunity to counterattack!</p><p>During the course of the battle.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on two tasks, working with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to observe the ancient restriction.</p><p>His greatest hope was naturally to leave the cavern, but after analyzing, he found that the top of the cavern was not only sealed by the ancient restriction, but also had the thirteen ice mirrors transformed by the Fallen Serenity Divine Restriction.</p><p>A double obstacle.</p><p>Yin Changsheng would surely go crazy to prevent them from leaving. Qin Sang could at most break through one layer, and would then be at a disadvantage.</p><p>For now, the only options were to follow Tong Lingyu's advice and try to stall for time, but Yin Changsheng was unfathomable, and Qin Sang was worried about other variables.</p><p>Or to target the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool or Yin Changsheng himself. Yin Changsheng's mind was unstable, and destroying the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool, shattering his hope of becoming a Deity Transformation cultivator, would make him retaliate madly, making it even more dangerous, but it would also reveal flaws.</p><p>But such an opportunity would not be easy to come by.</p><p>Yin Changsheng never left the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool.</p><p>The figures of Tong Lingyu and Luo Yun had already disappeared.</p><p>The ice platform had dragged them down, sinking to the bottom of the blood pool, and it was unknown what their final fate would be.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that despite the intense battle earlier, the blood in the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool had not shown any ripples, indicating that some kind of power was protecting the blood pool.</p><p>But Qin Sang looked and looked, and did not find any obvious defensive spirit formations.</p><p>He had a vague feeling that the aura of the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool seemed to be directly connected to Yin Changsheng himself. If he was the so-called 'formation eye', things would be troublesome.</p><p>'Swish swish swish…'</p><p>Qin Sang retreated repeatedly.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword trembled, and the sword formation revealed a flaw.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened, as if he was using his tenacious willpower to resist the effects of the damage to his primordial spirit, forcefully maintaining the sword formation from collapsing, resisting the fierce attack of the Coiling Serpent.</p><p>Yin Changsheng did not doubt him, and laughed heartily.</p><p>He had taken advantage of Qin Sang's use of the sword formation to suddenly attack, and had also lured Qin Sang into being distracted to protect Liuli. He did not believe that he could have failed.</p>
