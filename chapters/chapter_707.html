<h1>Chapter 699: The Yuan Ying Cave Mansion</h1><p>“Daoist Fan was able to invite Daoist Qin. It seems we needn't worry about this trip.”</p><p>The scholar in green smiled kindly at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression softened slightly. He bowed and said, “Daoist, you flatter me. I'm not yet clear on why Daoist Fan invited me, and I haven't agreed to anything.”</p><p>The short, stout cultivator said repeatedly, “Daoist Qin, please come ashore and wait a moment.  Once the other Daoists arrive, I'll explain everything clearly.  Whatever conditions I promised you, I will certainly fulfill them if you agree.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then flew over on his sword, his eyes sharp as he checked the island for anything unusual before landing on a rock, keeping his distance from them.</p><p>The scholar in green exchanged a few pleasantries with Qin Sang, but seeing Qin Sang’s cool demeanor, he wisely ceased speaking.</p><p>After a while, three more cultivators arrived—all of them cultivators Qin Sang recognized from the market.</p><p>Qin Sang observed them coolly, noting that they were all top-tier early Nascent Soul cultivators, each possessing considerable strength.  The stout cultivator’s scheme was clearly ambitious.</p><p>“Daoist Fan, why did you summon us here? You can tell us now, can't you?”</p><p>It was nightfall, and someone impatiently questioned.</p><p>The stout cultivator chuckled, “Daoist Qian, please be patient.  One more Daoist is yet to arrive, but they should be here soon.  Then, Daoist Fan will definitely not keep you in suspense and will explain everything thoroughly.”</p><p>As he spoke, a green rainbow suddenly flew from afar, stopping outside the island, revealing the figure of a thin, elderly man.</p><p>“Daoist Wan has arrived!”</p><p>The stout cultivator’s face lit up. He was just about to greet him when he heard the thin elder shout angrily, “Fan, you said you invited me to search for treasure together. Now you’ve gathered so many people here in ambush. What’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>The stout cultivator explained profusely, and the thin elder only hesitantly flew closer.</p><p>Seven Nascent Soul cultivators were now gathered on the island—enough for a small trading gathering.  Everyone looked at the stout cultivator, curious about his intentions.</p><p>It was obvious that the stout cultivator had paid a hefty price to persuade so many people to come, so whatever he sought had to be worth the reward.</p><p>The stout cultivator cleared his throat, and without further ado, said solemnly, “Today, I invited you all here to ask for your help in breaking a restriction.”</p><p>“A restriction?”</p><p>“What kind of restriction?”</p><p>“Could it be an ancient restriction? Has Daoist discovered a legendary ancient realm in the Demon Sea?”</p><p>“Where is it located?”</p><p>…</p><p>For a moment, everyone was intrigued and questioned him repeatedly.</p><p>Even the thin elder, who had been grim-faced, showed an excited expression.</p><p>After the two races’ incursion into the Demon Sea, the Demon Beasts proved too strong, nearly overwhelming the Great Waste Island and the Heaven Witch Island. The human cultivators only managed to secure a small area, constantly threatened by beast tides, and never discovered any legendary ancient realms in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Some suspected that before the Demon Sea was discovered, it might have always been the territory of the demonic beasts with no human cultivators present; therefore, there were no traces left by ancient cultivators.</p><p>Hearing that the stout cultivator was asking for help in breaking a restriction, everyone was surprised yet also highly interested.</p><p>The stout cultivator waved his hands repeatedly: “My Daoist friends, you misunderstand.  It’s not an ancient realm. I suspect it’s the cave mansion of a senior cultivator…”</p><p>“A senior cultivator's cave mansion?”</p><p>Everyone looked at each other in astonishment.</p><p>The thin elder sneered, “These temporary cave mansions are everywhere.  Who would be foolish enough to leave anything valuable inside? Aren’t you afraid of disappointment?”</p><p>The scholar in green frowned and thought for a moment, then said gravely, “Daoist, you are willing to spend such a large sum to get us to act, so you must have noticed something. Which senior cultivator’s cave mansion is it?”</p><p>The stout cultivator nodded, “To be frank with you all, the cave mansion’s restriction actually has three layers. I’ve managed to break through two of them, but the third one is immovable no matter what I try. I originally planned to seek help from my friends, but unfortunately, they're trapped on Huntian Island and can't get out.  So I resorted to this strategy, taking advantage of the market opening to invite you all to assist me.  Even with only two layers broken, I’ve discovered some things that suggest the cave mansion’s owner might be extremely significant. I'm risking everything, but I’m willing to gamble.”</p><p>The gaunt elder scoffed, "Who was the owner of that cave?  Fellow Daoist Fan is being awfully secretive. Was it some Yuan Ying master?"</p><p>The gaunt elder's laughter trailed off as he noticed the stocky cultivator staring at him with a strange expression.  His face froze, disbelief etched on his features. "It was actually a Yuan Ying master's cave?"</p><p>"Hard to say," the stocky cultivator shook his head. "I consider myself reasonably skilled, but the restrictions were impenetrable, even to me.  That level of power suggests at least a Golden Core peak cultivator. And, I found something else in the cave…"</p><p>The stocky cultivator produced a decaying piece of fish skin.</p><p>The fish skin was severely deteriorated, seemingly ready to crumble at the slightest touch.  The once-tight scales were now patchy and mostly gone.</p><p>At the sight of the near-ruined skin, everyone's faces changed.</p><p>"This is…" the scholar in green robes swallowed hard, his voice trembling.  "The hide of a Transformation Stage demon beast?"</p><p>Qin Sang also stared intently at the fish skin. Despite its decay, the powerful aura of the demon beast remained, chilling them to the bone. This instinctive sense of awe and oppression, Qin Sang had only felt in the presence of Yuan Ying masters!</p><p>The skin of a Transformation Stage demon beast!  He had never seen anything like it.</p><p>Everyone was speechless, staring dumbly at the fish skin.</p><p>The stocky cultivator nodded. "As you can see, this is what I found in the cave.  I was overjoyed, but the simple restrictions on the hide had long since faded, and even the skin of a Transformation Stage demon beast couldn't escape the ravages of time. You all understand how terrifying these beasts are.  Even a Yuan Ying master would treasure such a hide. Conversely, only a Yuan Ying master would treat it so casually."</p><p>The fish skin was too decayed to be of much use.</p><p>The stocky cultivator casually passed it to someone nearby, and it was passed around.</p><p>When it reached Qin Sang, he held it carefully, gently stroking the hide. He'd seen living Transformation Stage demon beasts in Xiao Han Region, but never a dead one.</p><p>The skin was genuine; its unique aura was unmistakable.</p><p>The stocky cultivator said gravely, "Now, do you believe me, fellow Daoists?"</p><p>The gaunt elder reluctantly returned the fish skin, hesitantly asking, "If there's even the hide of a Transformation Stage demon beast, it seems you must have gotten many valuable things. Surely not everything was as decayed as the hide? Why not let us see what else you found?"</p>
