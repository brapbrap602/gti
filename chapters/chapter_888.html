<h1>Chapter 880: The Old Daoist</h1><p>Fang Ting was nowhere to be seen.  </p><p>Hua Shen, his expression unchanged, followed the others towards the summit.</p><p>Soon, they emerged from the forest and arrived before a grand hall.</p><p>A middle-aged cultivator stepped forward and announced loudly, “Master, I have, as instructed, conducted the apprentice selection ceremony.  The chosen apprentices are here for your inspection.”</p><p>“Enter…”</p><p>The hall doors opened automatically, revealing a familiar voice from within.</p><p>“Master Chen?”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator quickly entered, discovering Master Chen and the girl, Fang Ting, whom he had brought.  He exclaimed in surprise, “Master…?”</p><p>Master Chen calmly replied, “Sect Leader happened to have a sudden breakthrough in his cultivation and has gone into seclusion. I will handle the remaining matters. Do you have any objections?”</p><p>“I dare not!”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator’s face changed slightly. He quickly presented a jade slip, “Master Chen, this jade slip contains the information of the new disciples.”</p><p>Master Chen grunted, accepting the jade slip and surveying the group.</p><p>Under the gaze of a Golden Core cultivator, everyone felt uncomfortable, harboring silent anxieties.</p><p>Upon entering, Fang Ting saw Hua Shen and greeted him happily.</p><p>Hua Shen inwardly sighed, maintaining a calm demeanor.</p><p>He never expected this man to decide their fates, hoping for impartiality.</p><p>“Lan Dou Sect just took a batch of disciples, so having this many is quite good. You've all done your duty,” Master Chen nodded to the four cultivators, offering praise.</p><p>The four cultivators showed delight.</p><p>Master Chen then turned his gaze, pointing at the three-spirit-root youth, “You! Come here!”</p><p>The youth was startled, his face pale, knees trembling.</p><p>“Am I so frightening?”</p><p>Master Chen frowned, displeased. “No wonder you were rated as having poor temperament. As you suggested, you will be sent to the Casting Hall for three years of training, to observe your progress!”</p><p>With that, Master Chen tossed the youth a red token, dismissing him to the side.</p><p>He then selected several more, sometimes asking questions, sometimes not, simply handing out tokens.</p><p>His questions were unpredictable, sometimes about their origins or experiences, sometimes about their cultivation insights, leaving them unprepared.</p><p>The tokens were of various colors, representing different halls within Yan Miao Pavilion.</p><p>As Master Chen selected each disciple, Hua Shen grew more anxious.</p><p>Finally, only two remained: himself and the oldest elder.</p><p>“This old fellow wouldn't be targeting me, would he?”</p><p>Hua Shen muttered to himself, worried that his undercover mission might fail due to such a minor setback.</p><p>“Your name is Zhao Songqiao? Come forward.”</p><p>Master Chen called out the elder, leaving only Hua Shen.</p><p>Fang Ting sensed something was amiss and remained silent, not daring to speak. The others, not foolish, had noticed the situation and were watching with interest.</p><p>“For your cultivation level, your temperament is remarkably well-tempered. You're not without hope of building your foundation.”</p><p>Master Chen was kind to Zhao Songqiao. “Go to the Xue Ying Hall. The hall master is my disciple; he will guide you in changing to a sect technique, and see if you have a chance.”</p><p>“Yes, Master!”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao received the snow-white token, his face filled with excitement.</p><p>Finally, it was Hua Shen's turn. Master Chen pointed at him, about to speak, when his expression suddenly changed. He abruptly looked towards the entrance of the hall.</p><p>The others, puzzled, looked as well, seeing only the vast expanse of water.</p><p>“Why is this old fellow here?”</p><p>Master Chen frowned, showing surprise, muttering to himself before waving his sleeve and shooting a blue light arrow outwards.</p><p>The arrow shot beyond the peak, exploding after a distance. Ripples appeared in the void, and two figures slowly materialized.</p><p>These two wore black and white robes adorned with yin-yang symbols.</p><p>One was a slender elder, holding a whisk, with an ethereal, refined aura. The other was short, standing behind the elder, resembling a young Daoist attendant.</p><p>After appearing, they paused briefly before flying towards the hall.</p><p>“Brother Chen, I apologize for the unexpected visit.”</p><p>The old Daoist bowed, glancing around in surprise. “Where is Daoist Qi?”</p><p>“If Daoist Huayang is looking for the Sect Leader, I’m afraid you'll be disappointed. The Sect Leader is indisposed,” Master Chen returned the bow, his tone cold. “If you have urgent business, I will convey your message upon his return.”</p><p>"I hear your sect is holding an initiation ceremony today.  These are the new disciples, yes?  Is there anything more important than the continuation of the sect's legacy?  Could it be that Daoist Qi has sensed a breakthrough and is about to form a Nascent Soul?"</p><p>The old Daoist, seemingly oblivious to the cultivator surnamed Chen's implicit dismissal, strode over, his gaze sweeping across the new disciples with an unsettling intensity.</p><p>Everyone felt uncomfortable under his scrutiny, but seeing even the Golden Core cultivator of the Yanmiao Sect treat him with deference, no one dared to speak.</p><p>The avatar felt a surge of surprise.</p><p>Though he had never met this old Daoist, the peculiar robe immediately revealed his origins.  He was a cultivator from the Lan Dou Sect, and moreover, a practitioner of one of their core techniques, the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Art*.</p><p>The Yanmiao Sect and the Lan Dou Sect clearly had a close relationship.</p><p>To encounter a Lan Dou Sect master so soon after joining...</p><p>The avatar couldn't fathom the reason for Chen's coldness towards the old Daoist, and as a newly initiated disciple, was unable to guess at the underlying situation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang's true body stood on a hill overlooking the mist-shrouded Yanmiao Sect, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>Hidden in the shadows, he intended to leave after confirming the avatar's safety, traveling around Lan Dou Mountain for a while to try and make connections, working with his avatar in a coordinated effort.</p><p>Suddenly, he sensed a fluctuation and saw a streak of light flying from afar, disappearing into the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't make out the old Daoist's features, but the unique black and white light was unmistakable on Lan Dou Island – it strongly suggested a Lan Dou Sect master.</p><p>The light had come from the direction of the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>"What could a Lan Dou Sect disciple be doing here?  I'll wait and see, perhaps I can find a way to approach him…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, after a moment's thought, he returned to his hiding place.</p><p>…</p><p>In the Yanmiao Sect's main hall.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Chen, suppressing his displeasure, said calmly, "Daoist Huayang, please don't jest, Sect Leader's cultivation hasn't reached its peak, he's still some distance from forming a Nascent Soul. Besides, forming a Nascent Soul isn't so easy. What good will a couple of breakthroughs do? The Nascent Soul is not something that can be achieved at will!"</p>
