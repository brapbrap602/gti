      Han Xiao would never make a losing deal. The price that he asked
                for was very high, and most players would not be able to afford
                his equipment. He soon thought of launching rental services for
                his weapons to gain a profit through low margins but high sales.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, Han Xiao rejected this idea immediately after.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       If the players damage the weapon, I will make a loss, and
                  there might even be some players that don’t return my
                  equipment. Before ensuring that the weapon can be retrieved in
                  perfect condition, rental service is not a good idea,
      </em>
      Han Xiao thought.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The concentrated sound of gunfire came from the nest under the
                West City Area, together with explosions. The ground trembled
                lightly, shaking up the sand and dust on it.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      While the players hunted the Shadow Stalker Vipers, the people
                of Dark Net were not doing nothing. They drew out the map of the
                underground nest from the images of the detectors and divided
                the nest into areas on the ground.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Your Excellency, the habits of the Shadow Stalker Vipers are
                alike to ants. Their nest is very labyrinthine and complicated;
                it can be roughly divided into two areas—the core area and the
                activity area. The activity area makes up to 95% of the entire
                nest, and we are still looking for the core area,” Huang Yu
                reported.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao nodded. If his guess was correct, the Shadow Stalker
                Viper Beast King should be in the core area.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Beast King should be between the level of 50 to 60 and have
                a BOSS panel. This difference in strength could not be filled no
                matter how outnumbered it was by the players at the moment. Han
                Xiao would have to do it himself, which he planned to do as soon
                as they found the core area.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The nest was the Shadow Stalker Vipers’ territory. On the first
                day, the players split up and marched in at a very slow pace.
                Most of the players were completely thrashed. After all, it was
                the first time that these new players had faced a monster with
                such a high level. Thus, their weak spirit and mind were beaten.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao did not focus on the West City Area all the time. This
                was just a part of the sanctuary construction, and as a
                responsibility of the overseer, he patrolled the other areas’
                construction progress and went back to building machinery.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The class advancement requirement was five purple quality
                equipment. He could already stably build Compounded Magnetic
                Chain Split Blades, Iron Fist—Mounted Heavy Mechanical Arm, and
                Mini Maneuvering Equipment with dark blue quality. One time of
                over performance was all he needed to achieve purple quality for
                these pieces of equipment.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The failed products—those that did not reach purple
                quality—filled almost half of the entire room.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Only Han Xiao, who had so many assets, could afford such
                expenses.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Some players finally came to visit during the evening.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Jade Green Sky brought a group of guild members to visit. They
                expressed their intention of wanting to buy equipment.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      A large number of players resided in the sanctuary at the
                moment. Players could be seen all over the place requesting to
                team up and do missions. Many Mechanics opened up stalls for
                repairing, building, and enhancing services, and even Maple Moon
                would sometime open a stall to pass the time. The sanctuary did
                have the feeling of a main city indeed.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      These Mechanics were able to gain the blueprints of various
                low-tier machinery through Knowledge Fusion, each having its own
                uniqueness, and firearms were the most common type.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Mechanics who opened stalls demanded very low prices, so
                many not-so-rich players were very willing to buy from them.
                However, Han Xiao did not bother to do such things as it was a
                waste of time for him. The market that he was aiming for was
                high-end as his product quality was far beyond that of the
                players, and he had a lot of blueprints that they did not have.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He was irreplaceable—he had no competition.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “You want to buy equipment?” Han Xiao put down the parts in his
                hands.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Jade Green Sky nodded hastily.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Sky Territory had accepted the prize-pool mission, and they had
                a chance to go for a higher position, but other large guilds had
                arrived at the sanctuary a few days ago, and they were all
                strong competitors. Thus, Jade Green Sky wanted to buy Black
                Phantom’s equipment to stay ahead.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Jade Green Sky had bought a Light Mechanical Arm when the public
                launch had only just begun, and it was his main weapon even now,
                so he was very confident in Han Xiao’s products.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Great Mechanic Han had an outrageous amount of 230,000,000
                experience in his interface at the moment, so he could afford to
                spend some of that experience and gamble out some new
                blueprints, which made his inventory full of various types of
                equipment. To match the ever-increasing level of players, he had
                put in some new machinery.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After some consideration, he also added Iron Fist—Mounted Heavy
                Mechanical Arm and Mini Maneuvering Equipment into to his store.
                He had a lot of blue-quality products for these two types of
                machinery, which he had no use for, so this was a chance for him
                to get rid of them and gain some profit at the same time.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, he did not sell Compounded Magnetic Chain Split Blades.
                This was almost god-tier equipment for the players in the early
                stage, so Han Xiao did not want to sell it to players easily.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The people of Sky Territory took a deep breath when they opened
                up the store. The huge variation of products had their hearts
                beating faster, and everyone’s eyes twinkled brightly.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “God, even the lowest quality is green. There is even some blue
                quality equipment. I have never even seen blue equipment
                before!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “All of them are so tempting!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Jade Green Sky stared at the Heavy Mechanical Arm with
                excitement. This thing was stronger than the Light Mechanical
                Arm; it could largely increase his strength.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He looked at the price—120,000!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “So expensive!” Jade Green Sky’s face twitched. Although the
                guild was rich, 120,000 was still a significant amount; it was
                the price of dozens of firearms and many boxes of gunpowder.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After some hesitation, Jade Green Sky decided to buy it. He
                believed that it had more worth than anything else he could buy
                with that money!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Large guilds were rich. They purchased many pieces of equipment
                that totaled to 300,000 dollars, and they were given to Core
                Group One for the prize-pool mission.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao earned a fortune and offloaded some machinery that was
                useless to him at the same time—a very profitable deal.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He had set security measures within the machinery that he sold.
                The Mechanic players at the moment would only be able to pass
                through these measures only in their dreams, so it was
                impossible for the blueprint to be leaked. Therefore, Han Xiao
                was very confident when he sold them.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Having sole possession of the technology meant a monopoly—it was
                the most profitable business as there would not be another place
                where these products could be bought.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Du du!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Frenzied Sword and the other three returned right after Jade
                Green Sky left, bringing along new discoveries.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “We have detected a very high radiation strength, almost
                reaching the maximum on the measuring device,” Maple Moon said
                and passed the device back to Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was a little shocked. With such high radiation,
                creatures that lived near it would very likely go through
                mutations. Whether the mutation enhanced one’s strength or the
                other way around depended on the species and habits of the
                creature. Stronger creatures that had a higher resistance would
                more likely have enhancing mutations.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Which means there might be elite mutated variants in this
                  Shadow Stalker Viper herd,
      </em>
      Han Xiao thought.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “We have also discovered the source of the mutation—it’s these
                things,” Frenzied Sword said as he took out a bag of blue
                crystals and laid them out on the table. The crystals were
                filled with mist and cracks—they looked very turbid. The blue
                crystals reflected a mist-like aura from the light. They looked
                magnificent and almost magical.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      _____________________

     <p class="calibre5">
      Unknown Crystal: A crystal formed by unknown reasons. It is
                highly radioactive.
     </p>

     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The measurement on the device increased noticeably as it was
                moved closer to the crystal.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao wore a pair of gloves. He held up a finger-sized
                crystal and looked at it carefully. “Where did you find this?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “On the walls deep inside the nest.” Hao Tian gave a very simple
                answer.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Frenzied Sword added, “These crystals were embedded in the wall.
                We wouldn’t have found it either if the slime on it wasn’t
                scraped off during the battle. Furthermore, these crystals
                became more concentrated as we went deeper into the nest as did
                the monsters. We were unable to go even deeper, so we came back
                early.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao could feel the warmth from the crystal itself even with
                gloves, which solved one of his questions. These crystals
                provided the heat energy that made the Shadow Stalker Vipers
                build their nest here.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao waved at Frenzied Sword.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Without a hint of hesitation, Frenzied Sword walked toward Han
                Xiao, who suddenly did something shocking. He grabbed Frenzied
                Sword’s mouth and stuffed the crystal into it. Then he blocked
                his mouth, not letting him spit it out.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Swallow it.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Wuuuuuu—” Frenzied Sword’s face was filled with shock. He
                struggled all he could, but Han Xiao’s hands did not budge even
                an inch. Then, the crystal went down his throat. The three
                people watching from the side were stunned.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Any reactions?” Han Xiao stared at him.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Frenzied Sword let out a sigh like he accepted his fate. He
                touched his chest and looked at his interface.

     <p class="calibre5">
      Frenzied Sword described the status. Undying players were the
                best choice to test drugs. Han Xiao gave a large amount of
                experience to Frenzied Sword as a reward and said while nodding,
                “Well done.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Frenzied Sword felt much better when he saw the experience. He
                looked at the rest of the crystals on the table and
                pondered,
      <em class="calibre7">
       Will there be more experience if I eat all of them? It
                  actually tastes like sweets.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao knew what Frenzied Sword was thinking from the
                expression on his face. He awkwardly collected all of the
                crystals, denying Frenzied Sword’s thoughts.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      From the experiment, the rough uses of the crystals could be
                seen—purifying this type of radiation crystals would create
                crystal-formed energy, which was a form of clean energy.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had a thought. There were a lot of such crystals in the
                nest. He could use [Basic Extraction] to purify them and turn
                them into energy storage, and these energy crystals could even
                be used on all kinds of machinery if he made an energy
                transformation device. It was a valuable discovery.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Crystal energy was most commonly used in magic civilizations, it
                would also appear sometimes in technological civilizations. In a
                more fashionable way, such clean energy crystals could also be
                called ‘Non-Elemental Crystal’ or ‘Magic Crystal’. Mages would
                use magic techniques to harvest energy from these crystals to
                become their own energy or to power magic, so there were many
                uses for it.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       The concentration level of the crystals should lead to the
                  core of the nest,
      </em>
      Han Xiao thought and called Huang Yu over immediately.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After describing this discovery, Huang Yu instantly marked an
                area on the nest map that they had drawn.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “There’s a ninety percent chance that this is the core area.”
                Huang Yu pointed at the map confidently.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Very good.” Han Xiao nodded.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Time to act!
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At midnight, players continued to fight in the nest as they did
                not need to sleep.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The prize-pool mission motivated the players. Although there was
                no direct mission, they still received quite a lot of experience
                from killing the Shadow Stalker Vipers, which were a much higher
                level than them.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Sky Territory was at the top of the rank!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Quickly, T3 (third tank) pull the monster. T1 (main tank) and
                T2 (secondary tank), come back here now!”

     <p class="calibre5">
      “Pugilists attack at close range quickly!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Come on Espers, last longer! Go to the side to recover if

      The people of Sky Territory were surrounding a Shadow Stalker
                Viper and took it like a BOSS. Jade Green Sky was commanding and
                yelling, and they were having a very exciting time. The
                cooperation of Core Team One was very in sync.

      The slime in the nest would lower the players’ speed, but
                although the nest favored the Shadow Stalker Vipers, it still
                was a fish in a net when facing the core team of Sky Territory,
                which was extremely experienced in fighting BOSSES. The Shadow
                Stalker Viper could not break out of the net no matter how it
                tried, and its health was decreasing at a steady rate.

      All kinds of attacks downed on Shadow Stalker Viper. Its
                carapace started cracking, and slime splashed all over.

      Jade Green Sky charged forward. He wore a Heavy Mechanical Arm
                much thicker than his hands on his right arm and activated the
                active ability of the Heavy Mechanical Arm.

      The motors made a loud noise. Heated steam shot out of its
                ventilation pipes, and the iron fist hit straight at Shadow
                Stalker Viper’s head. At the same time, Jade Green Sky shouted
                out loud with passion!
