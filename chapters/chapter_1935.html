<h1>Chapter 1926: The Dao</h1><p>“What is a Ghost Cloud Steed?”</p><p>Vermilion Bird, hearing of this type of demonic beast for the first time, recalled that Luo Hou was still in a spirit form and suddenly realized, “You want to possess it?”</p><p>Luo Hou had been crippled by Qin Sang years ago and hadn’t found a suitable physical body. She herself was unwilling to settle, delaying it until now.</p><p>Luo Hou neither confirmed nor denied, replying, “The Ghost Cloud Steed's bloodline has a certain degree of compatibility with my own clan.”</p><p>If she wanted to possess a body, she didn’t have to insist on the Shadow Horse clan; she could also choose a similar bloodline as a vessel.</p><p>Luo Hou had several alternatives, the Ghost Cloud Steed being one of them.</p><p>Luo Hou's expression was clearly hesitant. Firstly, this Ghost Cloud Steed's bloodline was thin. Secondly, the Ghost Cloud Steed wasn't the best choice, only a middling to lower one.</p><p>But the demonic races Luo Hou had selected, including the Ghost Cloud Steed, were all extremely rare.  It had taken this long to encounter one.</p><p>Deeper within the Twilight Fall Mountains, there might be better options. She considered herself a defeated general, fortunate enough to survive and become a guardian spirit beast. How could she dare ask her master to make a special trip to find her a physical body?</p><p>Furthermore, the situation in the Twilight Fall Mountains was complex, teeming with Nascent Soul stage powerhouses.  Danger lurked everywhere.</p><p>She only had her spirit remaining, her strength diminished. Dealing with demonic cultivators like the Purple-Gold Divine雕 was more than enough, but facing powerhouses of the same realm, she fell somewhat short and wouldn’t dare venture into the Twilight Fall Mountains alone.</p><p>Encountering a Ghost Cloud Steed unexpectedly was a small stroke of fortune.</p><p>Possessing a Ghost Cloud Steed, although not as compatible as some other demonic races, still held the hope of restoring her to her peak, though it would require more effort.</p><p>Missing this opportunity, she didn't know how long she would have to wait for the next one. The prolonged lack of a physical body had a non-negligible impact on her cultivation. The sooner she possessed a body, the better.</p><p>“Then what are you waiting for? Go, go, go!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird urged repeatedly, clamoring, “I’ll deal with this guy! It dares to call itself the Demon Emperor in front of this divine bird? I’ll let it know how formidable this divine bird is!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird rubbed its claws together, its tone arrogant.</p><p>Luo Hou didn’t move, hesitating, “But, Master…”</p><p>“Why are you worried about that? Could that Qin fellow stop your possession? He brought you down the mountain precisely to help you recover. Otherwise, why wouldn’t he bring that fox?”</p><p>Vermilion Bird, with its little bit of cunning, rolled its eyes and guessed Luo Hou’s concerns, then suddenly burst into raucous laughter.</p><p>“Ga ga… You actually believed him? He keeps saying he won't kill, isn't it to help Little Five temper his demonic intent? He didn’t specifically tell us to show mercy when we came down. Do you take that Qin fellow for a rigid pedant who doesn’t know how to adapt, or do you really think your master is some great philanthropist?”</p><p>“Ga ga ga ga…”</p><p>Vermilion Bird laughed as if it had heard the biggest joke, clutching its belly.</p><p>Following Qin Sang, it had learned quite a few new and interesting words, such as ‘pedant.’</p><p>The laughter reached the Purple-Gold Divine 雕's ears, igniting its fury.</p><p>They were chasing and trying to kill it, yet they dared to be distracted by conversation and laughter.  It was a grave humiliation!</p><p>Luo Hou was still hesitant. Since descending the mountain, Qin Sang had slain demons and devils all along the way, creating rivers of blood.  Possessing another being was undoubtedly the act of a devil, even though the Ghost Cloud Steed had undoubtedly killed many mortals.</p><p>She wasn’t Vermilion Bird; she didn’t have the privilege of being spoiled and daring to ignore Qin Sang's words.</p><p>“Oh my, I didn't realize you were so timid!  If you’re unsure, just ask that Qin fellow! Quickly go catch that Ghost Horse thing before it escapes!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird flapped its wings, condensing a fiery feather that transformed into a crimson streak, piercing through the air.</p><p>Luo Hou left the Purple-Gold Divine 雕 to Vermilion Bird, leaping towards the Ghost Cloud Steed.</p><p>Vermilion Bird shook its wings, glancing sideways at the enraged Purple-Gold Divine 雕 with a wicked chuckle.</p><p>“Your demise has come!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird, having learned more elegant new words from the mortal world, roared and ignited itself in raging flames, swooping down on the Purple-Gold Divine 雕.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>The Purple-Gold Divine 雕’s words were unflinching, but it didn’t turn its head.  However, it was easily overtaken by Vermilion Bird. As soon as they clashed, it realized something was amiss.</p><p>Vermilion Bird seemed to only be at the late Nascent Soul stage, comparable to the Purple-Gold Divine 雕, but it couldn't be treated as an ordinary demonic beast.</p><p>Moreover, the Demon Emperor had just taken a direct hit from Luo Hou and was already injured.  It quickly fell into a disadvantage, swallowed by the overwhelming flames.</p><p>With the imperial palace breached, the Demon Emperor was preoccupied.</p><p>The other demonic beasts, each acting on their own, were a disorganized rabble. They couldn't organize any decent offensive and retreated steadily, escape itself becoming a luxury.</p><p>Luo Hou captured the Ghost Cloud Steed, moving like a phantom to clear the battlefield. The demonic horde could only surrender.</p><p>The sky above the capital city became the battlefield for Vermilion Bird and the Demon Emperor.</p><p>“No one interfere!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird’s roar came from within the flames. It finally had a chance to fight and wanted to have some fun.</p><p>“Senior Luo, what do we do now?”</p><p>A cultivator stepped forward.</p><p>Luo Hou gazed for a moment, certain the Purple-Gold Divine 雕 couldn’t escape. “Let Master Vermilion Bird play. We’ll go reinforce elsewhere!  Let's go!”</p><p>“Play?”</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. To treat a late-stage Transformation realm great demon as a plaything was simply inconceivable!</p><p>With the arrival of reinforcements, the other two battlefields crumbled just as easily.</p><p>Three demonic nests, all destroyed overnight!</p><p>Finally, the group marched towards the capital of the Myriad Spirits Kingdom. The great battle hadn't yet concluded, but the Purple-Gold Divine 雕 was already at the end of its rope.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A blast of crimson fire slammed into the ground like a meteorite, destroying half the imperial palace. The earth trembled!</p><p>When the flames dissipated, everyone saw a small Vermilion Bird with one foot planted on the head of the Purple-Gold Divine 雕, countless times larger than itself.</p><p>Vermilion Bird preened its feathers, its gaze sweeping over the crowd.</p><p>Amidst a chorus of flattery, its little head rose higher and higher, its beak almost poking the heavens.</p><p>Su Xuanzhu and the others took care of the aftermath. The three demons, their task complete, departed without a trace.</p><p>Vermilion Bird called out to Luo Hou, shaking a fiery feather, “Your master has already given permission. Why aren’t you possessing it quickly? What are you waiting for?”</p><p>“I’ll trouble the two fellow Daoists to protect me!”</p><p>Luo Hou, without questioning its truthfulness, made up her mind and landed on a hilltop with the Ghost Cloud Steed.</p><p>Vermilion Bird and Tai Yi stood on either side, guarding her.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day at noon, the three demons returned to Tai Yi's cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang was comprehending the Tai Yi Thunderclap Talisman. Seeing Luo Hou, he was a bit surprised. “You found a physical body yourself? This poor Daoist was planning to make a trip to the Twilight Fall Mountains. This saves me the trouble.  Take these pills. Quickly adapt to this body and recover your strength.”</p><p>He tossed a jade bottle.</p><p>Inside the bottle were three spiritual pills, all extremely precious. They were obtained from the Demon King’s remains, specially refined pills for demonic cultivators, greatly beneficial to Luo Hou.</p><p>Luo Hou finally understood that Qin Sang had remembered her all along.  She immediately knelt and kowtowed, gratefully saying, “Thank you, Master, for the pills.”</p><p>“Hee hee, I told you he wouldn't refuse. You still insisted on asking for permission…”</p><p>Vermilion Bird hopped onto Luo Hou's shoulder, brimming with pride.</p><p>“Asking for permission?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Vermilion Bird.</p><p>Vermilion Bird abruptly covered its beak, its eyes darting around, then it turned and rushed towards the entrance. However, a powerful force yanked it back, causing it to shriek.</p><p>“Luo Hou needs to focus on refining her physical body and isn’t convenient to be a mount anymore.  From now on, you will take over.”</p><p>Qin Sang, deaf to the screams, raised a finger and pointed.  The flames on Vermilion Bird’s body surged.</p><p>“Master…”</p><p>Luo Hou opened her mouth, then met Qin Sang’s gaze and fell silent.</p><p>Before long, a crimson-feathered great bird flew out of the mountain, carrying everyone on its back towards the sky, leaving behind heart-wrenching screams.</p><p>“Ah! I, the dignified Vermilion Bird!”</p><p>…</p><p>Fire Domain, Daoist Abode.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body awoke from meditation, calculated with his fingers, and murmured, “It’s almost time for the appointed meeting with the Cloud Cauldron City Lord.”</p><p>Now, restoring his foundation was no longer a problem. Qin Sang had to consider the priorities of his future cultivation.</p><p>Comprehending the Dao of Slaughter was clearly not something to rush.</p><p>Seeking the Dao, seeking the Dao…  The most important thing was enlightenment and understanding of the Great Dao.  Epiphany referred to precisely this.</p><p>His true body emerging wouldn't be any better than his avatar.</p><p>Entrusting it to his avatar, letting his avatar continue to wander the mortal realm and seek opportunities from within, might be the best choice.</p><p>What Qin Sang's true body needed to do was to gain strength matching a Void Refinement cultivator as quickly as possible.</p><p>The various divine abilities and treasures from before Void Refinement, some of them, were now slightly lacking in power.</p><p>Especially the three immensely powerful Buddhist Seals, arguably his most important means before Void Refinement, were now limited by his physical cultivation.</p><p>Comprehending thunder arts wouldn't yield extraordinary results in a short time unless the Thunder Altar could bring him a pleasant surprise.</p><p>He had two choices.</p><p>One was to quickly raise his physical cultivation, breaking through to the sixth level of the *Heavenly Demonic Body Tempering*.</p><p>The other was to comprehend the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, relying on the *Purple Star Sword Canon* and Celestial Master Tian Yue’s sword light, to deduce a Sword Domain from the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation.</p><p>Even if he could only grasp a hint of the Sword Domain's essence, he would gain a tremendous advantage when fighting Void Refinement cultivators!</p><p>A breakthrough in swordsmanship would undoubtedly bring about a leap in his strength, but the difficulty was certainly immense.</p><p>For over three hundred years, Qin Sang had often pondered where he should start.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang gained some clues and made a plan, though he hadn’t yet tested it.</p><p>Celestial Master Tian Yue’s words back then were also a subtle guidance.</p><p>Evolving the sword formation into the celestial bodies, Qin Sang knew it would be difficult and didn’t dare to have such grand ambitions for the time being.</p><p>Creating his own Celestial Bodies Sword Formation had to be gradual. He planned to emulate the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation and gradually construct the Southern, Eastern, and Northern Seven Lunar Mansions.</p><p>With the Four Symbols complete, he would achieve the Four Symbols Sword Formation!</p><p>Thus, the sword formation could be considered a minor accomplishment. Then he would evolve the Sun, Moon, and Nine Luminaries, the Three Enclosures of Purple Forbidden Enclosure, Supreme Palace Enclosure, and Heavenly Market Enclosure, and finally achieve the complete Celestial Bodies Sword Formation.</p><p>This was a grand plan, and Qin Sang wasn't sure if he could complete it in the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Images flashed through Qin Sang’s mind – what he had witnessed in the Divine Court.</p><p>There were images of the Western White Tiger Star Field he had memorized while being pursued by the Demon King.</p><p>And the moment when he was possessed by the Thunder Ancestor, controlling Heaven and Earth, placing Heaven and Earth and the Divine Court beneath his feet.</p><p>This imprint on his soul seemed to also include some impressions of the Divine Court, the Four Star Fields, the Three Enclosures, and the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions.</p><p>His consciousness had been hazy at the time, and he had suffered repeated shocks afterward, unable to calm his mind. The remaining impressions were faint, very faint.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t sure how much he could gain in the end, but if he could truly glean something from it, using the essence of the Divine Court to construct his sword formation would undoubtedly multiply his efforts!</p><p>Compared to directly observing the ethereal celestial bodies, this was undoubtedly a shortcut.</p><p>Of course, if he could achieve a breakthrough in the *Heavenly Demonic Body Tempering*, he could also rely on the three Buddhist Seals to gain formidable combat power.</p><p>Qin Sang lightly tapped his knee with his fingers.</p><p>He had asked the Cloud Cauldron City Lord in advance to help him collect potent poisons, and it was almost time for their agreed-upon retrieval.</p><p>The *Poison God Canon* was secondary. Qin Sang pondered, he should now focus on comprehending the Dao of Dharma Manifestation. The deeper his understanding, the easier it would be to break through future bottlenecks.</p><p>The Great Dao was diverse, yet interconnected. He was already a Void Refinement cultivator. His understanding of the Oneness of Heaven and Man would also be beneficial to comprehending Dharma Manifestation.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A fierce wind arose within the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Dharma Manifestation.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation, carefully sensing it.</p><p>Previously, guided by Master Zuo, he learned about the so-called inner and outer landscapes in physical cultivation, but his understanding remained very vague.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had grasped some of the true meaning.</p><p>Void Refinement stage Dharma cultivators manipulated the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, with the emphasis on control.</p><p>The transition from inner landscape to outer landscape for physical cultivators was also the Oneness of Heaven and Man, but it pursued the integration of Heaven and Earth into oneself, with oneself as the core.</p><p>It was like absorbing the power of Heaven and Earth, nourishing oneself, achieving one's own inner Heaven and Earth, thus, in turn, influencing the true Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Then what about the Nascent Soul?</p><p>Was it taking Heaven and Earth as the root, with the soul actively merging into Heaven and Earth?</p><p>The most extreme choice on this path, was it to abandon the self, to exist within Heaven and Earth, to be one with Heaven and Earth?</p><p>It seemed to have some similarities with the Divine Dao, which either rooted itself in the mountain and river veins or relied on the worship of incense and fire.</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang’s mind. He recalled the Nascent Soul that attacked him in the Divine Court, its figure like a phantom. He couldn’t see at all how it had moved in front of him.</p><p>Did these three different Daos represent the three ultimate paths for sentient beings seeking the Dao, then further differentiating and branching out into various other Daos?</p><p>These were the results of Qin Sang's continuous contemplation.</p><p>He knew there must be many errors and omissions, but it didn’t matter. With the advancement of his cultivation, he would gradually perfect it and comprehend the true location of the Dao.</p><p>This process was a journey of seeking the Dao, and also a transformation and sublimation of himself!</p><p>“Dao! Dao! Dao!”</p><p>Qin Sang repeated the word continuously.</p><p>Facts proved that the higher the realm, the greater the importance of ‘Dao,’ and the smaller the influence of talent.</p><p>At the Void Refinement stage, who would care whether you had five spiritual roots or not?</p><p>Of course, the speed of comprehending the Great Dao was also a kind of talent.</p><p>Some had sudden enlightenment, while others toiled for half their lives.</p><p>“Is this comprehension? But the level of comprehension certainly can’t determine future achievements. It can still be supplemented by external means, gaining inspiration.”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation.</p><p>The so-called Dharma Manifestation was an external manifestation of the power of the inner Heaven and Earth.  With his Void Refinement understanding, his ‘comprehension’ of the Dharma Manifestation was undoubtedly beyond compare for ordinary people.</p><p>Qin Sang silently circulated the *Heavenly Demonic Body Tempering*.</p><p>Several days later, the stone door of the cave dwelling opened. Qin Sang emerged, full of energy. He instructed Gui Hou to guard the abode and flew out of the Daoist Abode.</p><p>He flew unhurriedly in the sky, crossing the Fire Domain and arriving at Cloud Capital Mountain, observing the changes below.</p><p>It seemed that over two hundred years, Cloud Capital Mountain hadn’t changed at all, at least superficially, it was very peaceful.</p><p>Under Yun Du Tian’s governance, Cloud Capital Mountain enjoyed lasting peace and stability, a blessing for cultivators.</p><p>Cloud Cauldron City.</p><p>Qin Sang only came to the Immortal City once every few decades, but all the successive guards knew his name.</p><p>Upon entering the city, he was personally escorted by the commander of the guards directly to the topmost level of Cloud Cauldron City.</p><p>The City Lord himself came out to greet him.</p>
