<h1>Chapter 2012: The Jade Blade</h1><p>Seeing that Qin Sang didn't mind Steward Luo's presumptuous words, Deacon Ruan wisely closed his mouth and looked at Steward Luo.</p><p>Steward Luo appeared calm, but in reality, his heart was incredibly tense. The other party was not only a Void Refinement Stage powerhouse but also an elder of the Five Elements Alliance, a person of high status who could not be offended.  If it weren't absolutely necessary, he wouldn't dare to stubbornly insist on his own opinion.</p><p>His mind easing, Steward Luo hurriedly took out a purple stone. "If Senior can remove the impurities from this Purple Source Stone and refine the purest Purple Firmament Divine Iron, that will be sufficient proof."</p><p>Seeing the stone in Steward Luo's hand, Qin Sang was somewhat surprised.</p><p>Purple Firmament Divine Iron was a precious spirit material; he was naturally aware of it. However, he had never heard of this Purple Source Stone, nor was it recorded in the Five Elements Alliance's archives.</p><p>According to the records, Purple Firmament Divine Iron existed in the form of crystalline grains in the Great Thousand World. Often, as long as a vein was discovered, one could obtain the purest Purple Firmament Divine Iron. However, Purple Firmament Divine Iron had a troublesome characteristic: these grains were independent, making it extremely difficult to fuse them into a single piece.  Furthermore, the crystalline form of Purple Firmament Divine Iron could not be directly used for refining tools.</p><p>"Where did you obtain this Purple Source Stone?"</p><p>Qin Sang drew the stone into his palm, his divine sense probing within. He immediately made another novel discovery. Purple Source Stone was far less pure than Purple Firmament Divine Iron grains, but the Purple Firmament Divine Iron refined from it could directly form a solid piece, saving the trouble of fusion.</p><p>"It is said that the Purple Source Stone comes from a region within the Savage Wilds. A vein formed due to the special environment there. Unless there are similar environments elsewhere, only that place produces Purple Source Stone," Steward Luo replied.</p><p>"The Savage Wilds?"</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep look at Steward Luo. No wonder even the Five Elements Alliance had no records of it.</p><p>The family backing Steward Luo could actually produce treasures from the Savage Wilds. What was their background? Could they be from the chaotic territories between the Great Zhou Dynasty and the Savage Wilds?</p><p>Within a few breaths, Qin Sang had already grasped the general characteristics of the Purple Source Stone. Refining Purple Firmament Divine Iron from it was not particularly difficult. The key lay in how much loss occurred during the refining process and how much pure Purple Firmament Divine Iron could be extracted. This would reveal the refiner's skill.</p><p>Especially for someone just encountering Purple Source Stone, only with a profound accumulation in the Dao of Refining could the loss be minimized. It was indeed a clever method of verification.</p><p>Qin Sang stood where he was, his eyes slightly closed, the Purple Source Stone resting in his hand, preparing to refine it on the spot.</p><p>Seeing this, Deacon Ruan quietly activated the courtyard's formation, pulling Steward Luo to the side to silently observe Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>True Essence gradually converged towards Qin Sang's palm, a visible mist enveloping the Purple Source Stone.</p><p>The Purple Source Stone tumbled within the mist.</p><p>Refining Purple Source Stone did not require fire; pure True Essence was sufficient. Firstly, it demanded powerful cultivation and precise control over every minute change within the Purple Source Stone. Secondly, it relied on past accumulation to perform a subtle analysis of the Purple Source Stone, meticulously extracting the Purple Firmament Divine Iron like unraveling silk from a cocoon without contamination from impurities.</p><p>Deacon Ruan and Steward Luo held their breath, watching as wisps of turbid Qi dissipated from the mist. The Purple Source Stone gradually shrunk, its luster becoming increasingly pure. They couldn't help but reveal expressions of astonishment.</p><p>Finally, the fist-sized Purple Source Stone was reduced to the size of a fingernail, like the purest amethyst, radiating a vibrant purple light.</p><p>"Elder Qin's skill is truly divine! This junior is filled with admiration!"</p><p>Steward Luo stepped forward, his demeanor even more respectful. "This piece of Purple Firmament Divine Iron is a gift from my master to Elder Qin. Please wait a moment, Elder Qin. This junior will return and invite my master to come personally. However, my master was recently injured and is currently using a secret technique to heal. If there is any disrespect, I hope Elder Qin will pardon him."</p><p>With that, Steward Luo bowed and excused himself. Not long after, he personally drove a carriage to the Five Elements Alliance gate.</p><p>Pulling the carriage was a unique Spirit Horse.  All sorts of strange spirit beasts were commonplace within Jade Gate Pass and didn't attract attention.  Only those with sufficiently keen spiritual senses could faintly perceive something special about the aura of the Spirit Horse and the carriage. Just as they were about to observe more closely, Deacon Ruan had already invited the carriage inside.</p><p>The carriage drove into Qin Sang's courtyard. Steward Luo lightly landed, standing beside the carriage, and whispered, "Young Master, this is Elder Qin of the Five Elements Alliance."</p><p>Then, bowing to Qin Sang, who was sitting in the courtyard toying with the Purple Firmament Divine Iron, he was about to speak when the carriage curtain trembled slightly.</p><p>"My surname is Xin, and my given name is 'Sheng.' Greetings, Elder Qin. Due to my ailing health, I'm forced to employ a family secret technique, which has rendered me immobile and my appearance strange.  I dare not show myself openly.  Please forgive my discourtesy."</p><p>Qin Sang raised his eyes towards the carriage.</p><p>The carriage faced him directly, separated only by a thin curtain. It seemed as if he could see the scene inside through the gaps, yet he could only perceive a blurry aura, unable to determine this Young Master Xin's cultivation level.</p><p>The other party's voice was extremely hoarse, indeed sounding like they lacked vitality.  He didn't know if it was real or a pretense.</p><p>Looking at the Spirit Horse pulling the carriage, it was clearly an illusory creation, indicating that the carriage must be a unique treasure capable of isolating the spiritual sense of even a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang hadn't used his divine sense to forcefully probe. Otherwise, it might not have been able to block him. But if he had done so, it would have been impossible to continue their conversation peacefully.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang couldn't completely believe the other party's words.  Steward Luo and Young Master Xin's words and actions gave him the feeling that they were deliberately concealing some secret. Their identities might not be genuine. Were they perhaps avoiding some enemy?</p><p>However, inviting a Grandmaster Refiner to the Abundant Jade Gate to refine treasures was extremely rare. Qin Sang had long anticipated that there might be some underlying complications.</p><p>He always valued practicality over formalities. Moreover, since the other party's words were relatively sincere, he didn't delve into it further. Placing the Purple Firmament Divine Iron on the table, he sat in his original spot and said indifferently, "You have witnessed my skills. Since Young Master Xin has come personally, you must be sincere. Let's get straight to the point."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Young Master Xin paused for a moment, as if organizing their words. "This matter is of great importance. Before reaching our destination, we cannot reveal the exact location. We can only tell Elder Qin that it is a Small Thousand World within the Abundant Jade Gate…"</p><p>…</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>An inconspicuous carriage drove out of Jade Gate Pass, gradually swallowed by the wind and sand.</p><p>At the city walls, several pairs of malicious, hidden eyes stared intently at the carriage.</p><p>Just as the carriage disappeared into the wind and sand, several figures stealthily darted out, attempting to follow behind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after pursuing for a while, the carriage ahead vanished without a trace. This group from different factions, having lost their target, stood in the desolate desert, staring blankly at each other.</p><p>"Elder Qin, shall we deal with those fellows?"</p><p>On a hill, Qin Sang, who had already left the city, stood there with more than ten people behind him.</p><p>Among the group were Nascent Soul and Divine Transformation cultivators, each with fierce expressions and an aura of intense murderous intent. They were members of the Everlasting Sand Society.</p><p>Within the Abundant Jade Gate, the danger level varied depending on the location. Nascent Soul cultivators could explore the outer regions alone, but to venture deeper, they needed Divine Transformation cultivators to lead them.</p><p>Six of them were Divine Transformation cultivators. The one who spoke was their leader, named Qu Zhen, with Late Divine Transformation cultivation. The Nascent Soul cultivators were also shrewd and capable, constituting a considerable force anywhere.</p><p>"No need," Qin Sang raised his head towards the sky.</p><p>A Dragon-Phoenix carriage was descending from the sky.</p><p>Having left Jade Gate Pass, the carriage finally revealed its true power. The Spirit Horse pulling it transformed into eight Dragon-Phoenixes.</p><p>Four dragons and four phoenixes, incredibly divine. The carriage's structure also changed. Apart from Young Master Xin's private chamber, a spacious hall appeared, supported by over a dozen Dragon-Phoenix stone pillars.  Gauze curtains adorned the exterior, while the interior featured jade tables laden with fine wines and immortal fruits.</p><p>"Elder Qin, fellow Daoists, please come aboard. Riding the treasure carriage will save us some effort," Young Master Xin invited.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't decline, boarding the Dragon-Phoenix carriage with Qu Zhen and the others.  They each found a jade table and sat down.</p><p>The Dragon-Phoenix carriage trembled, and just as it started its journey, Qin Sang's gaze suddenly sharpened.  He stared intently towards the north, his eyes flashing with a bright light.</p><p>Everyone on the carriage immediately noticed Qin Sang's unusual behavior. Following his gaze, they saw only the boundless yellow sand and dust.  They couldn't help but tense up, thinking that danger was approaching.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, and he vanished from the carriage in an instant.</p><p>The reins on the Dragon-Phoenixes suddenly tightened, and Young Master Xin brought the carriage to a halt.</p><p>At this moment, everyone faintly sensed several auras in the north, chasing each other.  It seemed like one group was pursuing another, and their highest cultivation level was only at the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>They looked at each other in confusion. A female cultivator softly asked, "Could there be a junior of Elder Qin among those being pursued?"</p><p>It wasn't the first time they had encountered people fighting, yet Elder Qin had never intervened.</p><p>Qu Zhen shook his head and dispatched all the Divine Transformation cultivators to investigate.</p><p>Steward Luo hesitated.  "Young Master, should we…"</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Young Master Xin uttered only a single word.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Amidst the wind and sand, three streaks of light were chasing each other.  It appeared that two men were jointly pursuing a woman in front.</p><p>All three were Divine Transformation cultivators. The pursuers were two black-robed men, while the woman in front had a disordered aura and was already injured.</p><p>The woman's jade blade danced around her with exceptional agility, repeatedly blocking the opponents' attacks.</p><p>However, her face was filled with anxiety.  Each pursuer's cultivation surpassed hers. If not for the jade blade, she would have already been defeated. Now, tightly pursued, she had no chance of escape and would eventually succumb to exhaustion.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>An ice arrow was deflected by the jade blade, shattering into pieces.</p><p>One of the black-robed men was unconcerned, instead revealing a greedy expression.  "Unexpectedly, this time there's an unexpected harvest!  A mere Early Divine Transformation cultivator possesses a treasured blade on the verge of transforming into a Spirit Treasure!"</p><p>"If we seize this blade, we brothers will soon have our own Spirit Treasure," the other man licked his lips, a lewd look in his eyes. "This little vixen is also quite attractive, a top-grade cauldron. Too bad there's only one. We brothers will have to take turns enjoying her!"</p><p>"Hahahaha…"</p><p>The two men laughed unrestrainedly, using their words to assault the woman's spirit.</p><p>None of the three noticed a figure silently appearing before them.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the woman, or rather, at the jade blade beside her.</p><p>Although the jade blade was vastly different from what it once was, it had been refined by his own hand, and within its body, a familiar aura still lingered.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand, and the jade blade abruptly left the woman, flying towards him of its own accord.</p><p>The woman also saw Qin Sang and discovered that she had completely lost control of the jade blade.  Her blood nearly froze, and her eyes filled with terror.</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked the jade blade, as if communicating with an old friend, or perhaps reminiscing about the past.  Looking at the terrified woman, he softly asked, "What is your relationship to Patriarch Bing Han of the Illusory Spirit Sect?"</p>
