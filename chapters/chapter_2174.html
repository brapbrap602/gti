<h1>Chapter 2164: Warning</h1><p>“That Qin Zhenren is still unaware of the danger. Since he hasn't gone far, we might find something if we follow his trail,”</p><p>Yuan Jian offered, a look of regret on his face.  “That Qin Zhenren's thunder escape technique is extraordinary, truly unparalleled in my experience. Once he joins forces with Prince Yan and becomes alert, it will be much harder to kill him. It's a pity we arrived too late. Otherwise, with the Immortal Child using the Ancestor's authority to coerce the Imperial Lord into helping us ambush Qin Zhenren, he wouldn't have been able to escape!”</p><p>He and Qin Sang had no personal grievances.  Back then, when setting the trap, he never considered Qin Sang a serious threat, merely a pawn along with the Storm Realm.</p><p>Only to be overturned by the pawn!</p><p>A miscalculation. Yuan Jian could only blame himself for misjudging, mistaking someone worthy of being a player in the game for a mere pawn. Even now, he harbored no resentment towards Qin Sang; his renewed attempt to harm Qin Sang was solely to appease the Immortal Child.</p><p>Seeing Yuan Jian's genuine desire for revenge, the Immortal Child's expression softened slightly, finding Yuan Jian more agreeable. He nodded. “Let them follow!”</p><p>…</p><p>Taking leave of the Imperial Lord, Qin Sang hurried to meet Si Lu.  Naturally, he wouldn't openly reveal his whereabouts, changing direction several times along the way, leaving the Immortal Child and his followers searching in vain.</p><p>Midnight, the following day.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the designated location, a place marked as Chihu Lake on the topographical map.  In reality, it was a forest, where the leaves of the trees were fiery red, resembling flames from afar, hence the name.</p><p>The trees in Chihu Lake possessed incredibly tenacious vitality. Legend has it that the forest had been ravaged multiple times by cultivator battles. In the worst instance, the entire forest was destroyed, the land virtually plowed by powerful magic. Yet, when the 異人族 (Yi Renzu) cultivators returned, they were astonished to find the vegetation had regrown, Chihu Lake restored to its original state.</p><p>This miraculous phenomenon piqued everyone's curiosity, leading to various speculations about a hidden secret beneath Chihu Lake.</p><p>The plants in this forest were ordinary spirit trees, possessing no unusual qualities except for their leaf color. This was illogical, especially since the surrounding areas were normal; only Chihu Lake was different.</p><p>Consequently, many Yi Renzu cultivators came to Chihu Lake, employing various methods to investigate. The land and sky were searched countless times, with spirit trees even felled for close examination, all to no avail.</p><p>Everyone knew Chihu Lake held a secret, but no one could uncover it.  Similar places were not uncommon in the Sacred Land. Only through some unforeseen opportunity or profound good fortune could someone possibly unlock the mystery.</p><p>Gradually, people returned empty-handed, even those who came to Chihu Lake to try their luck dwindling, as numerous other secret realms and lost palaces offered more enticing prospects.</p><p>In the night, Qin Sang saw a fiery red expanse amidst the mountains, instantly recognizing Chihu Lake. He withdrew his escape technique, calmly flying towards the lake.</p><p>He had arranged to meet Si Lu at the edge of Chihu Lake, expecting to wait for some time. However, upon entering the forest, he sensed something amiss.</p><p>Landing in the woods, Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he looked at the base of a spirit tree.  Amongst the root system, resembling a coiled dragon, lay an ordinary insect – a katydid.</p><p>The katydid, a vibrant green, lay still on the ground, with a faint, familiar divine essence faintly wrapping around it.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the divine essence as Si Lu's. The Si You tribe not only controlled companion beasts but also possessed unique skills in beast control. This katydid was clearly under Si Lu's control.</p><p>However, the katydid appeared lifeless, unresponsive to his arrival, causing Qin Sang to frown, sensing an ominous feeling.</p><p>He sent out a strand of divine sense to touch the divine essence within the katydid. “Daoist Friend Si Lu?”</p><p>“Qin Xiong has arrived?”</p><p>After a moment, Si Lu's voice, somewhat indistinct and weak, came from the katydid.</p><p>Qin Sang's tone deepened. “You're injured?”</p><p>Si Lu's tone became urgent. “Qin Xiong, beware! There may be an ambush!”</p><p>“Were you attacked?”</p><p>Qin Sang, ever cautious, had already awakened his Celestial Eye Butterfly to thoroughly scan the area, finding no abnormalities.</p><p>Nevertheless, Si Lu's reaction alerted Qin Sang to an unseen danger. His brow furrowed slightly as he enveloped the katydid in true energy, swiftly escaping Chihu Lake and landing in a valley, pressing, “Who did you encounter? Where is the Grand Marshal now?”</p><p>Si Lu said, “It's the younger brother of the Lu family's Grand Protector! The Grand Protector is actually from the Sacred Land; his brother came seeking revenge…”</p><p>Si Lu's voice was intermittent, but the story was finally explained.</p><p>Silu and the Grand Marshal, upon entering the sacred grounds, found their destination surprisingly close and their journey unimpeded.  Their objective was a cavern discovered by an ancestor of the Yanshan Si family. Initially believed to be the legacy of a powerful cultivator, they soon realized it was a trial ground, meticulously crafted by that same cultivator.</p><p>Unlike the secret realm discovered by the Siyou royal family, this trial ground was fraught with challenges, each offering substantial rewards.  The Yanshan Si family had prospered greatly from these rewards for generations.  Had it not been for an unforeseen incident, they would have continued to flourish until conquering the final trial.</p><p>The Yanshan Si family weren't the only ones aware of this trial ground, but generations of accumulated knowledge gave them a significant advantage—a likely reason for the Grand Protector's designs on the family.</p><p>The Si family's records, kept in the Mirage Pavilion, detailed everything about the trial ground, including the experiences and insights of past generations of their experts. Silu's father had previously attempted to overcome a specific challenge, failing but ultimately deducing its pattern, which he recorded in the Pavilion. Silu, despite his relatively lower cultivation, was well-prepared for this attempt.</p><p>Their initial progress within the trial ground was smooth, fueling their hope for success.  However, their advance was abruptly halted by a surprise attack.</p><p>“We weren’t careless,” Silu recounted, his voice trembling with pain. “The trial ground incorporates ancestral and royal protective formations, seamlessly integrated and under our control. Even top-tier experts would be detected and could be dealt with.  But they seemed to know the trial ground intimately, or possessed some way to bypass our senses. By the time we realized something was wrong, it was too late.  We were deciphering an ancient formation when they attacked.  I escaped using the formation's power, but the Grand Marshal stayed behind to cover my retreat…”</p><p>Silu's grief was palpable. The memory of Xia Changshi's self-sacrifice to ensure his escape still haunted him. While avenging the Grand Protector and destroying the Lu family brought some solace, the repetition of such tragedy was unbearable.  He was powerless to save those who died for him.</p><p>Qin Sang understood Silu's despair but needed clarity, asking solemnly, “Is there any chance the Grand Marshal escaped?”</p><p>After a pause, Silu lamented, “The attackers were led by a young man, claiming to be the Grand Protector's junior brother, a servant of an ancestor within the sacred grounds.  He certainly had accomplices; it wasn't just a couple of top-tier experts, otherwise, we wouldn't have been so completely unaware. However, from his words, it seems he's unaware of your presence in the sacred grounds…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed.  This meant the Grand Marshal's chances were slim; the only question was whether he was killed outright or captured.  While Qin Sang and Silu hadn’t revealed too many secrets to the Grand Marshal, Silu relied heavily on him, and some things couldn't be concealed. Capturing the Grand Marshal would lead directly to Qin Sang’s location.</p><p>Silu played a part in killing the Grand Protector, but Qin Sang, as the creator of the Thunder Altar, was the mastermind.  Seeking vengeance, the attackers wouldn't overlook him.  His presence in the sacred grounds as an outsider wasn't a secret among the Siyou.  The Grand Protector's junior brother would eventually learn of it through other Siyou cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't anticipated the Grand Protector's powerful connections.  His origin within the sacred grounds implied the backing of an ancestor exceeding the Saint realm—a serious predicament.</p><p>He wasn't afraid of the ancestor directly intervening; if such actions were permissible, the sacred ground trials wouldn't have lasted this long.  No one dares to kill casually, even those diminished minor clans possibly have their ancestors still alive.  Numerous upper clan heads have perished within the sacred grounds over the years, not to mention the descendants of various ancestral figures.</p><p>If the ancestor sought revenge on Qin Sang, they would consider the ancient pact and the Zhuyan clan's reputation, and Qin Sang could leverage Ning Zhenren's influence.</p><p>However, being targeted by a being beyond the Saint realm was undeniably dangerous.  The Grand Protector's junior brother alone was formidable, and he had accomplices.</p><p>Who informed the Grand Protector's junior brother?  Communication in and out of the sacred grounds was supposedly difficult; how did they connect? If it were Siyou cultivators, knowing Qin Sang’s presence and his invitation from the Siyou Emperor, they would prioritize eliminating the mastermind, a classic case of the enemy in the open, and themselves hidden in the shadows.</p><p>If it wasn't a Siyou cultivator, then who could it be?</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred, and a name came to her.  The mysterious strong cultivator behind Min Zhuo.  That person had secretly colluded with the Lu family back then, and certainly cooperated with the Grand Protector.</p><p>"Could it be him?"</p><p>Yuan Jian's image flashed through Qin Sang's mind, and a cold glint appeared in her eyes.</p><p>Last time, the Yuanxiang Clan leader said the other party's true goal was to target the Zhuyan clan, and the Storm World was merely collateral damage.</p><p>This time, however, it's different. The opponent brought in the Grand Protector's junior brother, and between them, there is a blood feud; it's a situation of irrevocable enmity!</p><p>"Qin Xiong, please be extremely careful. They definitely won't let you go," Si Lu said.</p><p>Si Lu was somewhat despondent, not mentioning revenge, nor daring to ask Qin Sang to rescue the Grand Marshal. This situation was even more hopeless for him; not only did the enemy have an ancestor behind them, but also many powerful helpers.</p><p>However, unknown to Si Lu, Qin Sang had already formed a killing intent.</p><p>With the Grand Protector dead, the hatred could not be resolved. She would absolutely not sit idly by and swallow her anger; to do so would only embolden the enemy.  Given any opportunity, she would definitely strike first.</p><p>Especially that fellow hiding behind the scenes, repeatedly using schemes and plots against them—he must be eliminated as soon as possible!</p><p>At least on the surface, the Ancient Covenant still held some constraints over the various tribes of the Yi people. As long as Qin Sang remains in the right, that ancestor would have no reason to interfere.  Even if the ancestor disregarded their face and personally intervened, Qin Sang was not without means of support.</p><p>However, Qin Sang hadn't yet figured out how to counterattack. Suppressing her killing intent, she said with concern, "Daoist Si Lu, how are your injuries?"</p><p>"I've taken a few spirit pills, and I can barely stabilize my injuries, but I still need time to heal.  Brother Qin, don't worry, my current hiding place is very safe. As long as I don't leave here, I should be able to hide for a long time, and they won't find me. It's a pity that I can't help Brother Qin before my wounds heal," Si Lu said apologetically, the whole turmoil was essentially caused by him.</p><p>Things having come to this, Qin Sang wouldn't blame others. She said, "Daoist friend, you should focus on healing, but don't let your guard down. Right now, nowhere in the Sacred Land is absolutely safe..."</p><p>Then, Qin Sang told Si Lu about her previous encounter and the possibility of an imminent霞光 eruption.</p><p>"Such a thing!"</p><p>Si Lu was startled. "Thank you, Brother Qin, for the warning. I will be careful."</p><p>The two discussed a method of communication, then Si Lu dispelled the divine intent within the cicada. The cicada's life force quickly vanished, and it died instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang casually waved her hand, erased the traces, looked towards the Red Lake, and frowned.</p><p>The situation had completely exceeded her expectations. Not only had she gained a powerful enemy out of nowhere, but she had also lost two helpers.</p><p>Her thoughts racing, Qin Sang didn't rush to leave.</p><p>She didn't know the Grand Marshal's temperament. If he were captured alive and interrogated, he might reveal their meeting place.  Even if the Grand Marshal remained tight-lipped, if the enemy used soul-searching techniques on him, there was a chance they could find out this information and set an ambush.</p><p>Interrogating the Grand Marshal would take time; perhaps she had arrived too early, and the enemy was still on the way.</p><p>It might be better to wait a little longer. Even if she didn't have a chance to strike, she could still assess the enemy's strength.</p><p>There was still plenty of time before her appointment with  琉璃, so Qin Sang could afford to wait.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang immediately acted, investigating the area around the Red Lake, finally selecting some concealed locations to secretly set up an array before lying in wait outside the Red Lake.</p><p>In a subterranean cavern, the space was narrow, dark, and lightless. Qin Sang sat cross-legged in meditation.</p><p>The spiritual energy within the Sacred Land was extremely pure and abundant.  The cavern Qin Sang was currently in had richer spiritual energy than most caves built on spirit veins in the outside world, and such places were commonplace within the Sacred Land.</p><p>Even if Yi cultivators entered the Sacred Land and didn't compete for opportunities or treasures, simply finding a superior cave to cultivate in would bring significant benefits.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was still a long way from the late Nascent Soul stage; it couldn't bring about a qualitative change in the short term. After a brief adjustment of her breath, she took out a [宝珠].</p><p>The treasure's luminescence illuminated the cave. After she cast the Thunder Seal, the [宝珠] returned to its original state.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang took out everything the Si Huang had given her.  She'd briefly inspected them before, and she had a faint sense of them. It was a good opportunity to investigate them carefully.</p>
