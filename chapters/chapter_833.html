<h1>Chapter 825: The Hegemonic Blood Fruit</h1><p>Xiang An Auction House.</p><p>Qin Sang finally met Yi Danshi.</p><p>“Long time no see, Daoist Friend Qin, you haven’t aged a day.”</p><p>Yi Danshi entered, chuckling.  A maidservant followed him, carrying a tray. She handed Qin Sang a small pouch from the tray.</p><p>Qin Sang opened it; inside were the spirit materials he had commissioned Xiang An Auction House to gather. They were for the spirit array to construct the staff of the Ten Directions Yama Banner. He’d collected some before, and now the rest had been assembled. Only high-grade spirit stones were missing.</p><p>“Thank you for your trouble!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s face lit up. He accepted the materials and paid the spirit stones.  His savings took another significant hit, but thankfully, he’d had a few windfalls recently and could manage.</p><p>After the maidservant left, Qin Sang continued, “After parting ways with Daoist Friend Yi, I returned several times, only to learn you’d gone to the Demon Sea. Later, I had urgent business that forced me to leave Tianxing Island. I didn't return for years. I heard there was quite a stir then; many weren’t just you who were sent to the Demon Sea. When did you return?”</p><p>“That's right, I did go to the Demon Sea.  Many daoist friends went with me, and most remain there. I only recently found an opportunity to return.”</p><p>Yi Danshi stopped smiling, sighing suddenly.</p><p>Seeing his hesitation, Qin Sang’s curiosity piqued. He asked in a low voice, “Daoist Friend Yi, did something happen in the Demon Sea?”</p><p>Yi Danshi nodded, hesitated for a moment, then cast a soundproofing barrier. “Daoist Friend Qin, if you trust me, it’s best not to go to the Demon Sea anytime soon. I suspect a great upheaval is imminent.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Qin Sang asked gravely.</p><p>He secretly guessed that in the Demon Sea, humans and witches must cooperate to survive; their only enemy was the demon race. Could the demons be stirring? If the two races were forced out of the Demon Sea, and all cultivators were trapped in the Canglang Sea, it was hard to imagine the chaos that would ensue.</p><p>“I can't say my guess is entirely correct, but in the two years I spent in the Demon Sea, I noticed a significant increase in beast tide attacks on the islands.  Two Yuan Ying Masters were even forced to abandon their islands, nearly severing the shipping routes.  These beasts seemed organized, as if orchestrated by some powerful demon. The recent actions of the Merchant League’s upper echelon suggest they've also noticed something. I have a very bad feeling, and I seized an opportunity to request a return. I only know how to refine pills, not fight. I don't want to be caught in a beast tide.”</p><p>Yi Danshi shook his head repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang had spent decades in the Demon Sea, experiencing beast tides firsthand. He knew the place well.  Hearing Yi Danshi’s words, he realized something was wrong.</p><p>Beast tide attacks on cultivator-occupied islands were common, such as the previous incident with Wuyuan Island.  Continuous attacks resulted in the loss of all five islands, forcing the cultivators to leave.</p><p>However, islands occupied by Yuan Ying cultivators were not easily lost; such events only happened once every hundred years or so.</p><p>In just a few short years, two Yuan Ying masters abandoned their islands. That was highly unusual.</p><p>“What do the demons want?  They wouldn’t try to drive the cultivators out of the Demon Sea, would they? As far as I know, Tianwu Island and Dahuang Island have never fallen.  They're connected by teleportation arrays, allowing for immediate deployment of experts,” Qin Sang questioned.</p><p>“Who knows? We know so little about the demons, only that several top demon clans rule the Demon Sea. I'm not worried about Tianwu and Dahuang Islands falling, but I fear that in a large-scale war, we're insignificant. If we're caught in the crossfire, we'll be at the mercy of fate, and nobody knows what will become of us. In the hands of the demons, keeping one's body intact would be a luxury…”</p><p>Yi Danshi paused, then smiled. “Of course, this is just my opinion, it might be wrong. Perhaps I’m simply being overly cautious.”</p><p>“I believe your words hold merit, Daoist Friend. Thank you for the warning.”</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude.</p><p>Yi Danshi then recalled something, changing the subject. “Daoist Friend Qin, you rushed here upon returning to the island. It's for the spirit fruit, isn't it?”</p><p>“You still remember,” Qin Sang smiled faintly.</p><p>“Of course, I never break a promise.”</p><p>Yi Danshi produced a jade slip and handed it to Qin Sang. “After returning, I finally found this spirit fruit in an ancient demon text from a friend’s collection. See if this matches your description.”</p><p>Translated from the demonic script, this fruit is called the Ba Xue Fruit. It's a demonic fruit that can cleanse the blood, marrow, and bones, with incredibly potent effects.  Only demonic beasts, with their powerful physiques, can withstand its power. For cultivators, consuming it risks a fatal rupture.  If you find this fruit, remember: never eat it raw.  It's best to find a pharmacist to mitigate its potency.”</p><p>“Ba Xue Fruit?”</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked. He was incredibly surprised.</p><p>The cultivation technique, *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, mentions three spiritual fruits that aid in breaking through to the third level. One of them is the Ba Xue Fruit!</p><p>The other two are the Qing Wu Root and the Scorpion Venom Herb.</p><p>Only the names are given, no illustrations.</p><p>He'd inquired about them before, but found nothing. He'd planned to ask Master Yi upon his return, never expecting to find one himself.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression remained unchanged as he calmly accepted the jade slip.  He found the name marked in demonic script and saw it perfectly matched the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* text!</p><p>“It really is the Ba Xue Fruit.”</p><p>Qin Sang read the demonic script, confirming Master Yi's words. It was indeed a demonic fruit with incredibly potent effects, capable of refining the body.</p><p>For demonic beasts, it’s a rare treasure.</p><p>When ripe, the Ba Xue Fruit is covered in a dense network of veins, appearing blood-red like blood itself. The fruit in his possession wasn't ripe, but already contained most of its medicinal properties.</p><p>“Demons consume it directly. After I break through to the third level of *Heavenly Demon Transformation* and my body transforms, I should be able to consume it as well. However, I still don't know where to find the place for Star Yuan Infusion.  With one Ba Xue Fruit already obtained, finding the other two herbs would allow me to break through this bottleneck. It's a viable option…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts raced. He withdrew his consciousness from the jade slip, stood up, and thanked Master Yi. “Thank you for your efforts, Master Yi. It is indeed the same fruit; I finally know its name!”</p><p>Master Yi shook his head. “Don’t celebrate too soon, Qin Sang. This demonic fruit is not easy to obtain.  I've never heard of it before;  few people have likely ever found it. Knowing its name doesn't help if you can't find it.”</p><p>“You’re right.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked dejected, and said with a wry smile, “Besides, I need more than just this. Master Yi, have you ever heard of the Qing Wu Root and the Scorpion Venom Herb?”</p><p>“Those…”</p><p>Master Yi paused in surprise.  “If I hadn’t looked them up, I wouldn’t have remembered.  According to the records, both are herbs used by demonic beasts to refine their bodies. Are you perhaps a body cultivator?”</p>
