<h1>Chapter 1583: Central Plains</h1><p>Chapter 1583: Central Plains</p><p>Clear Void Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, his breath gradually steadying.  He wasn’t injured, only his True Yuan was depleted. After a period of rest, he quickly recovered to his peak state.</p><p>Opening his eyes, Qin Sang glanced at the Sky Eye Butterfly perched on his shoulder. Its wings were slightly spread, and faint lightning flickered within its eyes.</p><p>When the Heavenly Tribulation had just ended, the Sky Eye Butterfly glowed brightly, almost completely enveloped in lightning threads, resembling a thunder butterfly born from the storm.  The lightning gradually faded, and the Sky Eye Butterfly finally absorbed the tribulation thunder into its body.  It conveyed a weary thought to Qin Sang, gently rubbed against him, and then retreated into his dantian, falling asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang had a feeling that once the Sky Eye Butterfly completely digested the tribulation thunder’s power, it would receive significant benefits, perhaps even greater than a century’s worth of cultivation.</p><p>“This is a path…”</p><p>He rubbed his chin.</p><p>Without the Witch Clan’s heritage, Qin Sang had to explore on his own.  Due to focusing on his own cultivation for nearly a hundred years, he had somewhat neglected the Sky Eye Butterfly, resulting in its cultivation lagging far behind his own.</p><p>The same was true for the *Heavenly Demon Refining Form*; it was still stuck in the early stages of the fourth level. After forming his Nascent Soul, Qin Sang had almost abandoned body refinement.</p><p>He considered himself quite lucky.  In his early Nascent Soul stage, he obtained the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper and the Nascent Soul Puppet; in the mid-stage, he received enhancements from the Cleansing Pool and obtained the Buddha Bone Relic. Not only was his cultivation speed not slow, but more importantly, his two breakthroughs were exceptionally smooth.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang had no choice but to devote all his energy to improving his realm and the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.  Everything else had to be put on hold.</p><p>No wonder most cultivators nowadays focused on spell cultivation; there simply wasn't enough time for simultaneous cultivation of side paths.</p><p>Letting the Sky Eye Butterfly absorb tribulation thunder to enhance itself seemed like a viable path, but it would require waiting for Qin Sang’s own tribulations – the three-hundred-year cycle of the forty-nine-day tribulation and the Divine Transformation tribulation – a tremendously long time.</p><p>Allowing the Sky Eye Butterfly to absorb another cultivator’s tribulation thunder was impossible.  Firstly, Qin Sang didn't want to expose the Sky Eye Butterfly’s abilities, and secondly, no cultivator would allow anyone to approach them during their tribulation.</p><p>Next, his main body and his clone would jointly comprehend the *Ice Soul Divine Light*.</p><p>Months later, the main body quietly left the Clear Void Realm and returned to Yan Shui Xu to continue cultivating secret arts.</p><p>After the Heavenly Tribulation, the Heavenly Dao’s suppression was gone. Qin Sang had broken free from a layer of restraint, finally able to move freely without worrying about an incident disrupting his next tribulation.</p><p>In the following years, Qin Sang unexpectedly took the initiative to invite Jiang Mu to his cave abode as a guest, engaging in discussions on the Dao, forging a degree of friendship.</p><p>As Jiang Mu had predicted, as the Ullambana Festival approached, auctions and treasure exchanges in the Central States gradually increased.  Before his tribulation, Jiang Mu had sent several messages, which Qin Sang had ignored at the time.</p><p>However, the top-tier treasure exchanges that truly interested Qin Sang had yet to appear.</p><p>Qin Sang participated in one auction and one treasure exchange for the sake of it.  A few items deemed “treasures” caught his eye, but that was all. He quickly lost interest and didn't want to waste more time.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that Qin Sang bought a Fire Date at an auction. When the Fire Date was presented, the Fire Jade Centipede in his spirit beast pouch stirred, transmitting an urgent thought.</p><p>Speaking of the Fire Jade Centipede, Qin Sang felt a bit helpless.  The Fire Jade Centipede was subdued, and compared to the Fat Silkworm, Qin Sang had better control over its state.  Although its ascension attempt in the North Sea had failed, it had gained significant benefits, greatly increasing its potential.  Later, it continuously consumed Fire Melting Pills and various spirit herbs collected by Qin Sang's avatar, and Qin Sang had expected the Fire Jade Centipede to advance before the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>Unexpectedly, more than a century had passed since his arrival in the Central States, and the Fire Jade Centipede remained firmly stuck at the bottleneck of the fourth transformation, unable to progress an inch.</p><p>The difficulty of a spirit insect’s advancement was evident.</p><p>Seeing this spirit herb that the Fire Jade Centipede desperately craved, Qin Sang didn't hesitate to bid for it.  The Fire Date also had obvious benefits for cultivators of fire-based techniques, attracting many bidders, including two Nascent Soul cultivators.  Fortunately, Qin Sang had obtained Yue Fei’s legacy, enabling him to successfully secure it.</p><p>After consuming the Fire Date, the Fire Jade Centipede reverted to its old habits, curling up into a ball.  It was fast asleep, but it hadn't spun a cocoon, not resembling a breakthrough.  Qin Sang couldn’t be sure and could only let it be.</p><p>Apart from this, Qin Sang could also learn about the overall situation through the Six States Hall.</p><p>Currently, the most talked-about event in the cultivation world was undoubtedly the appearance of the Luye lineage successor!</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Zinan had never met, but they indirectly had a feud. Yue Fei ‘died’ at the hands of his clone, and Old Wu retreated after losing to his main body.  They might have a showdown in the future.</p><p>Upon learning that Su Zinan had appeared in the Central Plains, Qin Sang paid special attention to this matter.</p><p>Su Zinan, dressed in white, arrived in the south with great fanfare.</p><p>Immediately upon entering the Central Plains, the Mingyue Guards recognized him, and news of his arrival spread rapidly. Countless cultivators and factions turned their attention to him.</p><p>Su Zinan, befitting his status as the adopted son of a Nascent Soul cultivator, possessed extremely high cultivation—a late-stage Yuan Ying cultivator—and made a grand entrance.</p><p>He was constantly accompanied by two Yuan Ying-stage Mingyue Guards at his beck and call, as well as a remarkable-looking stranger who shadowed him.</p><p>Later, it was discovered that the stranger was Mo Xingdao, a highly reputed and renowned independent cultivator from the Northern Wilderness.</p><p>Such a formidable figure acted as Su Zinan's bodyguard!</p><p>No one knew the extent of Su Zinan's power, for no one dared to offend them.  Even without Su Zinan needing to take action personally,  neither Mo Xingdao nor the Mingyue Guards were easy to overcome.</p><p>After entering the Central Plains,</p><p>Su Zinan disappeared for a period, his whereabouts mysterious and elusive, as if searching for something.</p><p>Then, he visited the Ganlu Zen Monastery and the Eight Scenic Views, as expected.</p><p>He stayed at both sects for a short time. Witnesses reported that he looked very upset each time he left, seemingly after an argument that ended with him departing angrily.</p><p>Next, Su Zinan's actions sent greater shockwaves through the Central Plains.</p><p>He announced his intention to recruit helpers to search for the Wuwang Palace in the East Sea.</p><p>During the last appearance of the Wuwang Palace ruins, many had witnessed the event and retreated from the outer perimeter; the Eight Scenic Views and Ganlu Zen Monastery suffered heavy losses, with even the Purple Thunder True Person injured.</p><p>Since then, the Wuwang Palace ruins vanished completely, never to be found again.</p><p>Coupled with the ruins' inherent danger, fewer people were interested in it.</p><p>As time passed, the uproar caused by the Wuwang Palace gradually subsided, but the events surrounding its emergence were not forgotten.</p><p>Many suspected that a Nascent Soul cultivator might be trapped within the Wuwang Palace.</p><p>Su Zinan's actions further fueled these suspicions.</p><p>Su Zinan announced that anyone who could help him reach the depths of the Wuwang Palace would be handsomely rewarded, even if he took none of the treasures within the ruins.</p><p>He displayed several treasures, two of which even Qin Sang found quite tempting.</p><p>Regardless of the credibility of Su Zinan's promise, his intentions were intriguing. If he wasn't seeking treasure, why would he go to such lengths to forcefully enter the Wuwang Palace?</p><p>Confirmation came that Su Zinan had appeared on the Chi Nan Island chain.</p><p>Many people rushed to the East Sea.</p><p>Upon learning this, Qin Sang considered meeting Su Zinan, quickly making a decision to leave his physical body in Pushan for cultivation, and go to the East Sea himself.</p><p>Firstly, to witness the Wuwang Palace.</p><p>Secondly, the Nascent Soul cultivator's whereabouts were uncertain, and Qin Sang wanted to confirm them. If a Nascent Soul cultivator was indeed missing or trapped somewhere, he wouldn't need to be so wary of the Ganlu Zen Monastery and the Eight Scenic Views when investigating the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>He followed the same route his physical body had taken before.</p><p>First, he took a boat down the Feiyun River.</p><p>The river flowed endlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the bow of the ship, listening to the water churning past, looking left and right, seeing only the boundless river, the banks invisible.</p><p>By now, he had left Zhuozhou and entered the heartland of the Central Plains—the Six States of the Jiangzuo region.</p><p>He silently calculated the distance, then looked up.</p><p>Soon,</p><p>Mist suddenly rose on the empty river surface.</p><p>This mist was peculiar; it was invisible from a distance but appeared suddenly when approached, clearly the effect of a spirit array.</p><p>The mist obscured a vast stretch of river but did not affect visibility.</p><p>"It's the Longju Wharf!"</p><p>Lower-level cultivators in the cabin exclaimed.</p><p>A throng of cultivators rushed to the deck, excitedly looking ahead.</p><p>As the name suggests, Longju Wharf was associated with the top-tier sect, Longju Cave Heaven. In fact, the wharf itself had no name; it was controlled by Longju Cave Heaven, hence the name commonly used by outsiders.</p><p>Longju Cave Heaven's mountain gate was located less than three thousand miles south of Zhuozhou, not far from the Buling Mountain, one east and one west, both on the banks of the Feiyun River.</p><p>Leaving Zhuozhou, one must pass Longju Cave Heaven first.</p><p>Longju Wharf was the second-largest wharf on the Feiyun River, second only to Feiyun Ferry, where the Feiyun River and the Fu River meet!</p><p>Furthermore, Longju Wharf was not only a docking point for ferries.</p><p>Large flying artifacts operated in the Central Plains, and the largest merchant behind them was Longju Cave Heaven.</p><p>Mist hung in the air.</p><p>On the river surface, at regular intervals, stood enormous white pillars extending thousands of feet into the sky, disappearing into the clouds. Upon closer inspection, they were columns of water.</p><p>Streams of river water were drawn upwards by some unknown force, like coiling dragons, forming massive pillars that ascended against the current, supporting the clouds above.</p><p>Many ferries were moored around each water column.</p><p>At this moment, a chorus of surprised exclamations rang out from the boats.</p><p>In the distance, a group of cultivators were seen disembarking. Then, a white shadow flickered at the base of a water column, and a majestic water dragon emerged from the river, clouds swirling around it, carrying the cultivators into the sky.</p><p>As the dragon ascended, the clouds parted, revealing the silhouette of a giant flying craft before disappearing.</p><p>The boat gently shuddered and came to a stop beside a water column.</p><p>The cultivators, impatient to leave, hurried off the boat and soared into the sky on their dragons.</p><p>The ferryman took on new passengers and continued south.</p><p>In the Central Plains, everything was orderly. This was undoubtedly good news for low-level cultivators, who could travel far and wide for a small fee without worrying about the dangers of the journey.</p><p>Years ago, before he achieved the Golden Core stage, Qin Sang didn't even know what lay south of the Great Yun Cang Marsh.</p><p>"How long can this peace last?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed silently and returned to his cabin.</p><p>After passing Dragon Residence Wharf, the treasure ship reached Flying Cloud Ferry, where Qin Sang switched to a merchant ship and headed east.</p><p>Flying Cloud Ferry was less a ferry than a vast lake.</p><p>The Flying Cloud River and the Fu River, the two most important waterways in the Central Plains, converged here, their constant flow creating the largest lake in the Central Plains, and perhaps the entire continent.</p><p>Ruins and bustling trade routes surrounded Flying Cloud Ferry.</p><p>The Eight Scenic Spots and the Ganlu Zen Temple were located on the east and west sides of Flying Cloud Ferry, on the southern bank of the Fu River.  Their mountain gates were a distance from the ferry, maintaining a respectful distance and avoiding interference.</p><p>Flying Cloud Ferry was like a pearl in the Central Plains, a jewel within a jewel!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't disembark. While this was his first time here in person, his avatar had visited several times, so he was familiar with the place.</p><p>There were cultivators living lives of decadent pleasure.</p><p>There were also mortals diligently pursuing their paths.</p><p>…</p><p>All sorts of people, from all walks of life.</p><p>All could be found at Flying Cloud Ferry.</p><p>As the ship sailed east, Qin Sang turned to look west.  West of the Ganlu Zen Temple lay the Tianhao Tower, the foremost sect of the demonic path.</p><p>Tianhao Tower, along with the Zezhou Demonic Cult in the Northern Territories and the Futian Valley in the Western Seven States, were known as the three great demonic sects of the Central Plains. Occasionally, a demonic cultivator would achieve the transformation into a Divine Soul.</p><p>These three sects moved in concert and maintained ties with the demonic sects of the Northern Wilderness, securing their position.</p><p>Moreover, Tianhao Tower had more allies than just these.</p><p>Continuing east along the Fu River,</p><p>passing the Eight Scenic Spots, nearing the East Sea.</p><p>The last of the super sects of the six states to the east of the river, the Qiongying Sect, was located here.</p><p>It was said that the Qiongying Sect had close ties to the immortal mountains of the East Sea, its influence rivaling that of Tianhao Tower.</p><p>The five major sects of the six states east of the river weren't strictly divided according to the boundaries of the six states.</p><p>The Dragon Residence Heavenly Domain and Qiongying Sect were not demonic sects, and the East Sea Immortal Mountains predominantly followed the Daoist path.  Yet, they secretly colluded with the Tianhao Tower. The three sects formed a roughly triangular formation, encircling the Eight Scenic Spots and the Ganlu Zen Temple.</p><p>This arrangement, once established, had remained stable to this day.</p><p>Of course, no matter how the three great demonic sects cooperated, they couldn't suppress or restrict Divine Soul-level powerhouses.</p><p>The Western Desert, largely the domain of Buddhist and Daoist sects, was clear evidence of this.</p><p>In the Western Seven States, Buddhism and Daoism had merged long ago, resulting in the creation of the Jingchan Mountain Villa, acting like a nail firmly lodged between the three great demonic sects, much to their displeasure.</p><p>The ship sailed out into the East Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang arbitrarily chose an island to disembark, and using his flying technique, he flew familiarly towards the Chi Nan island chain.</p><p>Upon reaching the Chi Nan island chain,</p><p>Qin Sang found it even more bustling than during his previous visit as his avatar.  Cultivators were arriving in droves, rumors spreading like wildfire.</p><p>Without much effort, he learned Su Zinan's whereabouts.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed briefly before flying out of the island chain.</p><p>He remembered this area from his avatar's journey by ship.</p><p>He deliberately suppressed his cultivation, changed his appearance, and flew across the sea for a while until he arrived at the location where the Wuwang Palace ruins had once emerged.</p><p>Hovering in mid-air, Qin Sang looked at the empty sea, feeling astonished.</p><p>If he remembered correctly, there should have been a large island here, but it was gone.</p><p>He circled the area, confirming that his memory was correct.  The mere aftershocks from the Wuwang Palace ruins had leveled a sizable island.</p><p>Qin Sang awakened his Heavenly Eye Butterfly, using his Heavenly Eye technique to search the sky and sea, but found nothing.</p><p>He pondered for a moment before flying southwest.  He sensed a chaotic aura ahead; at least several hundred people were gathered nearby, their cultivation levels varying widely, including several Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang approached discreetly and blended into the crowd without attracting attention.</p><p>He overheard snippets of conversation:  "Su Zinan and his people have been searching here for seven days without results. It looks like they'll be returning empty-handed again."</p><p>"Exactly.  So many people searched for years back, and they all gave up in the end."</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, gazing into the distance. He saw beams of treasure light shimmering on the sea's surface, with countless figures visible.</p>
