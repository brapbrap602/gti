<h1>Chapter 718: The Road Ahead</h1><p>“Fifteen years here, it’s about time I went back.”</p><p>A soft sigh echoed from the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around. The cave dwelling was simply furnished, but not austere.  Remarkably, the spiritual energy was exceptionally abundant, no less than those high-quality caves.</p><p>Finding such a superior cave in the vast妖海 (Yao Hai) was incredibly fortunate. He had been very content with his life there, almost unwilling to leave.</p><p>With the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring providing early warnings, Qin Sang had encountered real danger only a few times.  The pills and other supplies he’d prepared before leaving were still largely untouched.  Given his temperament, he could have stayed longer, using up his supplies before returning. Unfortunately, he only had two six-petal butterfly orchids left;  his Tian Mu butterfly was running low on food.</p><p>The six-petal butterfly orchids on Hong Ye Island must be ripe by now, but Qin Sang was completely out of touch with the outside world. He had no idea how far the conflict between the two factions had escalated, or if he could even reach Hong Ye Island safely.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang’s cultivation had steadily improved, and his two spirit insects had also grown at an astonishing rate.</p><p>Not long after settling here, the Fat Silkworm had absorbed all its poison pills, successfully reaching the mid-stage of its second transformation, as expected.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang was that after reaching the mid-stage, its absorption rate increased, but the effects of the pills became less noticeable.</p><p>After consuming all the poison pills Qin Sang had prepared, it was still a hair's breadth away from breaking through to the late stage, and the pills' effect was weakening.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang gave it real poison beast’s inner cores. After some initial difficulties, the Fat Silkworm could finally directly absorb them, much to Qin Sang’s relief. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have known what to feed it.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's abilities had been proven in several battles with poison beasts.</p><p>Its seven-colored aura had transformed into a detoxifying armor, now capable of resisting the intense poison of early-stage poison beasts.</p><p>The armor was as thin as a cicada's wing;  worn by Qin Sang, it was almost imperceptible to others. In the future, it would give him a significant advantage when fighting cultivators skilled in poison techniques.</p><p>Clutching a poison beast’s inner core, the Fat Silkworm was fast asleep in its insect cage, having successfully broken through to the late stage of its second transformation.</p><p>In comparison, the Tian Mu butterfly’s growth was slower. Although it had broken through to the mid-stage three years ago, its next transformation would likely be later than the Fat Silkworm's.</p><p>‘Ting…ting…’</p><p>The Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring flew up, emitting a burst of white light; the two-headed beast let out a pained cry.</p><p>Its injuries were improving, the wounds beginning to heal.</p><p>After being released, the two-headed beast struggled to its feet, its fur bristling, eyes blazing, teeth bared, growling at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face darkened; the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring tightened, and the two-headed beast shrieked, falling to the ground, trembling, sometimes curling into a ball, its wounds reopening without it realizing.</p><p>In its extreme agony, it even started butting its head against the cave walls.</p><p>Qin Sang watched coldly, his expression unchanging.</p><p>Only when the two-headed beast was gasping for breath did Qin Sang stop the punishment.</p><p>“I know your intelligence surpasses that of ordinary sea beasts; you should understand what I mean.”</p><p>Qin Sang approached, picked up the two-headed beast, and looked directly into its vertical pupils.</p><p>Even Qin Sang found this unruly beast somewhat troublesome.</p><p>Similar scenes had occurred several times along the way, and none had broken the two-headed beast’s will.  The previous Qing Jiao had submitted after the second time.  </p><p>The two-headed beast had no strength left, yet it stubbornly glared with its double pupils. However, Qin Sang keenly perceived a deep weariness in its eyes.</p><p>“You can’t expect me to release or kill you.  Whether you like it or not, the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring will eventually subdue you;  it’s best to accept your fate. Countless beasts have been taken as mounts by cultivators; you’re not the only one. You saw what happened to that Qing Jiao. I won’t bind you for life. When I find a better beast, or when you’re no longer useful to me, I will grant you freedom… on the condition that you obey my commands!”</p><p>The two-headed beast whimpered softly.</p><p>Qin Sang fed it a spirit pill and put away the ring.</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared on the surface of the sea, a nautical chart in hand. After checking his bearings, he decided to head north, retracing his original path.</p><p>The southern route was likely still occupied by the rogue cultivators, who were powerful and unpredictable. Qin Sang weighed his options and decided to take the northern route.</p><p>He also wondered if the Cold Flame was still in its original place or had been taken by the transformed demon.  After discovering that the transformed demon was attracted to the Cold Flame and appeared in this sea area, Qin Sang was very anxious and acted cautiously for a time.  He only relaxed when he noticed no further disturbances in the Demon Sea.</p><p>During this period, there was only one brief disturbance caused by demonic beasts two years ago. Qin Sang was already deep within the Demon Sea at the time, and the commotion had already subsided by the time he noticed anything unusual.</p><p>Two years ago, Qin Sang ventured north to investigate, suspecting it was another pass of the transformed demon. However, this time was different from the last; after an interval of over a decade, the transformed demon finally returned to its lair.</p><p>No one knows what the transformed demon did during its fifteen years lurking near Huntian Island.  Qin Sang suspected that the transformed demon's willingness to return meant it had likely succeeded in its objective.</p><p>After fifteen years in this region, Qin Sang was intimately familiar with the waters. He easily found the optimal route, gave a wave of his arm, and summoned his two-headed beast.</p><p>The two-headed beast lay on the surface of the water.  A bluish light flickered between its ribs, conjuring a pair of remarkably beautiful wings. Judging by its aura, its injuries were clearly healed.</p><p>Qin Sang mounted the two-headed beast, pointed out the direction, then closed his eyes and began to cultivate, leaving the beast to its own devices. The two-headed beast, rather reluctantly, stood up and, with a beat of its wings, took to the air.</p><p>Half a month later, Qin Sang saw the large island marking the exit of the Thousand Demon Sea. The western waters appeared normal, but Qin Sang decided to err on the side of caution and sent the two-headed beast ahead to scout, choosing to proceed alone.  A solitary traveler is better able to conceal themselves and escape danger.</p><p>Entering the Thousand Demon Sea and retracing his steps, Qin Sang encountered no large groups of demonic beasts. His taut nerves gradually relaxed as he approached Cold Flame Island.</p><p>A ghostly figure appeared on the still waters. Qin Sang turned towards the north, the direction of the Cold Flame.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang invoked the *Dun Ling Jue* (遁灵诀), flipped his palm, and revealed a scroll – a magical artifact seized from a young man of the Witch tribe, with a mesmerizing effect.</p><p>The scroll lightly sprang into the air, unfurling above Qin Sang's head, revealing an exquisitely detailed landscape painting of a lush forest, teeming with life and breathtaking beauty.</p><p>Flowers and leaves drifted from the painting, swirling around him, before silently vanishing.</p>
