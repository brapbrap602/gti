<h1>Chapter 1624: The First Move</h1><p>Tenglong Cliff.</p><p>The altar and the Five-Phase Order shone brightly.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The Five-Phase Order wobbled precariously, giving the illusion that it might be flung away at any moment.  The altar itself shook incessantly; the tremors seemed small, but held incredible force.</p><p>Five figures rotated with the altar, their hands pressed firmly against its edge, enduring the tremendous vibrations, unable to shift an inch.  Despite their top-tier cultivation, the continuous recoil from the altar was becoming unbearable, threatening to force them to release their grip or even cause injury.</p><p>Here, the difference in their lineages became apparent.</p><p>Su Zinan and the Swordsman were not disciples of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>A blood talisman spontaneously flew from Su Zinan's pouch, exploding with a *bang* and revealing a bloody figure.  The figure's features were contorted in agony, emitting a pained shriek that unsettled the minds of all who heard it – clearly an evil entity.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The blood figure turned and lunged at Su Zinan.</p><p>Su Zinan neither dodged nor evaded, merging with the blood figure.  A wave of blood washed across his face before returning to normal, his aura surging, the tremors in his arms significantly reduced as he clung to the altar.</p><p>The Swordsman lowered his head slightly, silently reciting sword incantations.  His heavy sword behind him trembled, its hum like a dragon's roar, before suddenly unsheathing.</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>The long sword soared through the air.</p><p>A torrent of blade energy erupted!</p><p>The sword itself was invisible; only its dazzling, crescent-shaped energy, blazed a path towards the space between the Swordsman's hands.  The tip silently pressed against the altar, sharing the burden of the recoil.</p><p>The other three had varying degrees of connection to the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>The white-robed man's robes billowed.  The robes weren't purely white; intricate patterns were revealed, seemingly concealing a miniature, snow-covered world within.  Visible pale gusts of icy wind surged from within the robes, gathering around him, growing stronger.  The cold air accumulated behind him, gradually forming an ice mirror.  The mirror hung behind the white-robed man, its surface reflecting the altar with shimmering frost.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man shuddered slightly.  Starting from his shoulders, his arms petrified, turning into two pieces of dead wood, his fingers like withered branches, tightly gripping the altar, ensuring he would not lose his hold.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao was the mastermind, but Su Zinan had yet to see him act.  He subtly observed Zhu Wu Dao through the shimmering light of the Five-Phase Order.  Unexpectedly, Zhu Wu Dao merely shifted his eyes to a pale gold, his gaze, seemingly substantial, fixed on the altar – no other actions. Without visible incantations or magical techniques, he stabilized the situation.</p><p>He was the most relaxed of the five.</p><p>Together, the five stabilized the altar, then turned their gaze upwards.</p><p>The Five-Phase Order emitted five colored beams of light.</p><p>In the center of these beams, the white light expanded considerably, forming a light orb the size of a human head, its strange fluctuations growing increasingly intense. These fluctuations were the source of the tremors. The light within surged, each surge generating a powerful tremor.  This tremor not only affected the altar, but the entire space, shaking the earth; the peaks of Taiyue Mountain trembled, and rocks tumbled down.</p><p>On the main peak,</p><p>Both sides had ceased fighting, drawn by the six ascending pillars of light.</p><p>Gold, green, blue, red, and yellow! Five beams of light, almost identical in scale, encircled the white beam. Initially, the white beam was smaller, but as the tremors intensified, the white light grew brighter, showing signs of surpassing the others.</p><p>The tremors were strongest on the main peak; lower-level disciples had to use their cultivation to maintain their footing, their faces showing their fear.</p><p>“There!”</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>Someone pointed at the light orb and shouted.</p><p>Hua Chenzi rebuked, “Quickly, regulate your breath!”</p><p>The disciples, startled, finally remembered their predicament; escaping the danger was paramount.  The invaders' continuous attacks had exhausted them; they quickly calmed their minds, preparing themselves.</p><p>The light pillars shot into the dark sky.  In the heavens, dark clouds gathered, locking onto the light pillars.  Otherwise, the phenomenon would be visible for miles, and before the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect even appeared, news would spread at an alarming rate, alerting various factions.</p><p>After several hours, the five colored light pillars stabilized, with only the white pillar continuing to expand. The light orb gradually swelled, revealing what seemed to be a deep passage within, filled with chaotic and multicolored light twisting together, charged with chaotic energy.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The origin of these light beams remained unknown, colliding and constantly exploding.  The power of the spirit array and the restrictions surged to the extreme, even mixing with spatial turbulence.</p><p>Su Zinan and his group were extremely close to the luminous orb, their expressions solemn as they witnessed the scene within.  Even they wouldn't guarantee their safety if caught in it.</p><p>"We must enter the Wu Xiang Immortal Gate from here?"</p><p>Su Zinan's brow furrowed, sensing danger.</p><p>"The great upheaval back then came unexpectedly. Our ancestors, unprepared, forcefully sealed the Wu Xiang Immortal Gate, causing spatial turbulence and chaos. We have no other choice but to force our way in. But don't worry, everyone. Once the passage stabilizes and the Immortal Mansion appears, there will be room to maneuver."</p><p>Zhu Wudao said, looking up at the sky to confirm that the anomaly was contained by the Mu Tian Xuan Array, then nodded silently.</p><p>Though subtle, the disturbance caused by the Wu Xiang Immortal Gate's emergence intensified, slowly overwhelming the Mu Tian Xuan Array. The tremors reached the outer gates of Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>Some time after the passage opened.</p><p>On a distant mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the fluctuation, awakening from meditation.</p><p>"Finally!"</p><p>He waved his sleeve, storing the Solar God Tree, and rushed out of his cave dwelling. Concealing his presence, he stopped a distance from the Taiyue gates.</p><p>From this vantage point.</p><p>Everything at Taiyue Mountain appeared normal.</p><p>But Qin Sang knew this was an illusion; a major upheaval had occurred within Taiyue Mountain!</p><p>"To seal a top-tier sect… what a grand scheme!"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.  Worried about countermeasures against detection within the array, he refrained from using his Sky Eye Butterfly for observation, opting to watch and wait.</p><p>Remaining hidden, he searched the area but found no trace of Zi Lei Zhenren, unsure if Gui Mu's assessment was correct.  Better safe than sorry.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>The luminous orb vanished.</p><p>Over those two days, the orb slowly ascended, and the power within the passage manifested externally. A spatial vortex appeared in the sky above Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>The vortex's range now covered a significant portion of Taiyue Mountain, its terrifying power threatening to destroy everything, creating an ominous and terrifying pressure.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A deafening roar, shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>Everyone looked up in shock. The passage had contacted the black veil; the edge of the turbulent flow finally collided with the Mu Tian Xuan Array.</p><p>Instantly.</p><p>Turbulence filled the sky, and the black veil tore.</p><p>The clash of forces created a storm that swept across Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>Trees were uprooted, halls collapsed, the ground trembled, and Taiyue Mountain's main peak seemed ready to crumble; utter devastation reigned.</p><p>Finally, the black veil shattered completely!</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Wudao could no longer contain the anomaly.  Strange lights shot into the sky, spatial fluctuations suddenly exploded outwards, and the celestial phenomena changed dramatically.</p><p>However, this was within Zhu Wudao's expectations.</p><p>Everything unfolded according to his plan. The top experts from various sects in the Central Plains had gathered in Jin Yu Prefecture. Even if they received news and rushed over, they wouldn't be able to stop them in time.</p><p>The vortex expanded at an increasing rate.</p><p>Through the vortex and passage, fleeting glimpses—a mountain range, a pavilion, a forest—could be seen, clearly projections from within the Wu Xiang Immortal Gate.</p><p>This confirmed that the Wu Xiang Immortal Gate had not been destroyed but remained intact!</p><p>Just then, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The altar began to shake violently, and several people struggled to maintain their balance.  The two imitation Wu Xiang Tokens clattered, threatening to break.</p><p>This unforeseen event could ruin everything.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Zhu Wudao's face suddenly changed, letting out a long cry.</p><p>The anomaly had appeared; there was no longer a need to seal Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and the others, hearing the cry, immediately retreated and rushed to surround the altar, each displaying their abilities.</p><p>…</p><p>North foot of Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>Yue Liting returned, entering a valley to meet Zi Lei Zhenren.</p><p>They hid there, gazing at the sky.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren searched for Zhu Wudao and the others.</p><p>…</p><p>West of the mountain gate.</p><p>Qin Sang stood beneath a tree, waiting patiently, intently watching the celestial phenomena.  His brow flickered as he summoned his external avatar.</p><p>…</p><p>Southeast of Taiyue Mountain, in the wilderness not far from Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>A figure hid within a strange mist, drifting through the woods at varying speeds, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>When the anomaly appeared.</p><p>The figure stopped abruptly, looking up sharply, revealing a pale face—Fan Laomo, the Grand Elder of Tianhao Tower.</p><p>The man was pale and beardless, his face devoid of blood, his aura chilling.  Initially surprised, he then remembered something, his expression turning from astonishment to elation.  "Zhu Laogui, I suspected your Qu Yang Mountain lineage was up to something.  So it's the remnants of the Wu Xiang Immortal Gate! Luckily, I tracked you here; otherwise, I would have missed a golden opportunity!"</p><p>He gave a sinister laugh and vanished.</p><p>…</p><p>Further away.</p><p>In a market town.</p><p>Low-level cultivators lacked the resources for long journeys to the Dharma Assembly, so they organized a smaller gathering in the market town, even offering prizes. Participants were mostly disciples from nearby smaller sects.</p><p>Two were dueling on stage, the audience captivated.</p><p>Suddenly, a commotion erupted outside. Several people left and never returned.</p><p>Screams arose, and curiosity overwhelmed the others, causing a rush from the hall; even the duelists stopped their fight.</p><p>The street was thronged with people, all staring towards Taiyue Gate.</p><p>“There… that looks like Mount Taiyue.”</p><p>“What happened at Taiyue Gate?”</p><p>“Impossible! Who would be so foolish as to attack Taiyue Gate? Looks like a treasure has appeared. Let’s go!”</p><p>As one person moved, a companion grabbed him. “You dare try to take Taiyue Gate's treasures?  You want to die?!”</p><p>“What are you afraid of?!”  The first man pulled his companion along. “The celestial phenomenon is so striking, it's not just us who have seen it.  Where there are many, there is no blame. Taiyue Gate gets the meat, we’ll get the broth! Let’s go see what's happening!”</p><p>His companion was swayed.</p><p>Soon, figures shot from the market town, flying towards Mount Taiyue on their magical artifacts.  Similar scenes unfolded around Taiyue Gate.</p><p>…</p><p>Southern Mount Taiyue.</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin were searching for the strange-faced man in the wilderness.</p><p>They were joined by Elder Ming of Wan Du Mountain.</p><p>While the Poison King and Master Huaiyin tracked the man, Elder Ming led Wan Du Mountain experts to search for clues, preventing any omissions.</p><p>As they traveled…</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin suddenly stopped, sensing something. Their expressions changed; they exchanged a glance, then their speed surged, their figures like lightning.</p><p>Elder Ming, bewildered, quickly followed, but could only see their backs.</p><p>After a chase…</p><p>Elder Ming finally caught up to them atop a mountain peak, and also saw the increasingly intense celestial phenomenon.</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>Elder Ming was startled. “It seems to be coming from the direction of Taiyue Gate.”</p><p>Master Huaiyin looked at the Poison King.  He was from the Western Lands, knew little of the Central Plains, and didn't understand the significance of this phenomenon.</p><p>The Poison King said nothing, lost in thought for a moment.</p><p>“Southern Xinjiang, the Immortal Mansion…”</p><p>The Poison King suddenly understood.  “The Unseen Immortal Sect!  No wonder this villain lingered in Southern Province.  A Nascent Soul disappearance… surely some scoundrels are causing trouble during the Dharma Assembly!”</p><p>“The Unseen Immortal Sect?” Master Huaiyin questioned.</p><p>The Poison King briefly explained.</p><p>Master Huaiyin nodded, about to go, but the Poison King stopped him.</p><p>After some thought, the Poison King turned. “They dare to act now, and on Mount Taiyue, no less. They must be quite powerful. If their cultivation is similar to this villain’s, we alone may struggle. The Daoist and Buddhist sects know the Unseen Immortal Sect best. Elder Ming, return to the mountain and send a message to Ganlu Temple, have them contact Master Xingji and learn the details!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Elder Ming left.</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin entered Mount Taiyue.</p><p>…</p><p>Somewhere on the border of Man Province and Southern Province.</p><p>The environment was starkly different from Southern Xinjiang; there was no miasma for a hundred miles.</p><p>The mountains were beautiful.</p><p>Morning mist drifted through the woods, birds sang in the quiet mountains, surpassing even the Central Plains in beauty.</p><p>Deep in the mountains lay an ancient temple, called Yan Yue Temple.</p><p>Only a few temples dotted the forest, embracing serenity and blending seamlessly with nature.</p><p>Yan Yue Temple was only slightly larger than the Eight Scenic Spots.</p><p>Leaves fell on the temple grounds.</p><p>Several nuns swept the leaves, just like any ordinary temple.</p><p>Their brooms were weightless in their hands, each movement effortless and serene, a form of cultivation itself.</p><p>In a quiet room…</p><p>An old nun, her fingers counting prayer beads, sat before burning incense, in meditation.</p><p>Suddenly, a young nun rushed in, flustered.</p><p>“What is it, why the commotion?”</p><p>The old nun asked quietly.  Her voice seemed to hold a calming power, easing the younger nun's anxiety.  She bowed. “Forgive my intrusion, Master. A stupa in the stupa field is suddenly glowing.”</p><p>The old nun paused, rose, and went to the stupa field.</p><p>“Master, it’s there.”</p><p>The young nun pointed to a stupa in the center of the field; it was indeed glowing.  Its shape was unlike the others.</p><p>The old nun finally showed emotion, a ripple across her face.  She instantly appeared before the stupa.</p><p>She gently touched it; her surprise deepened. She murmured, “The Unseen Immortal Sect…”</p><p>“Master, what is it? What is the Unseen Immortal Sect?” the young nun asked cautiously, having watched over the stupa field for years and never seen anything like it.</p><p>The old nun's palm glowed, merging with the stupa's light.</p><p>Then, she reached into the stupa, as if grasping something.</p><p>After sensing it for a while, she didn't answer, but instructed,  “Go summon your senior sisters from their seclusion. Yes, including your senior sister Liuli.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p>
