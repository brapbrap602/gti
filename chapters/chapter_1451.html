<h1>Chapter 1443: Top-Tier Evasion Technique</h1><p>Chapter 1443: Top-Tier Evasion Technique</p><p>A faint light flickered in the darkness, revealing hidden bamboo houses.  At the center stood a high platform where the Venerable Chongtai stood.  After his customary opening remarks, he briskly announced the start of the exchange.</p><p>Qin Sang sat up straighter.  The treasures listed on the inventory would be showcased first.</p><p>“I wonder what the owner of the ‘Seven Masters’ Buddha Seal’ wishes to exchange it for? I inquired with True Person Yinquan earlier; there are no famous physical cultivators at the String Moon Realm. Since it’s so rare, they shouldn’t demand too high a price…”</p><p>Qin Sang mentally assessed his needs and what he could offer.  First was the ‘Seven Masters’ Buddha Seal.  Then, the final spiritual material needed to refine the Jinchen Sword, which he was fairly certain he could acquire at the exchange.  And finally, the three main spiritual items for the Ascending Spirit Ritual:</p><p>Yuan Yin Water.</p><p>Seven-Colored Ganoderma fruit.</p><p>Yin冥土 (Yinmingtu –  rendered as “Yin Earth” for clarity).</p><p>The requirements for the Ascending Spirit Ritual were peculiar, including spiritual water, herbs, and more.  Especially the third item, Yin Earth, which Qin Sang had never even heard of.</p><p>Would four spiritual herbs be enough?  He mused.  He possessed many valuable treasures, but few he could readily trade, having had no time to prepare.</p><p>Just then,</p><p>a bamboo house silently appeared next to the Venerable Chongtai, shrouded in darkness, concealing its occupant.  A bright white light erupted from within, accompanied by a mechanical, monotone voice: “Three star feathers of the Imperial Star Bird, with the bird's true blood remaining at the base…”</p><p>As the voice described the item,</p><p>three feathers materialized in the white light.  Even from his room, Qin Sang could clearly see them—faint blue luminescence, their forms like ethereal stars, constantly shifting.  At the base of each feather, within the transparent shaft, was a drop of blue blood, seemingly still fresh.</p><p>Attendees could then project their spiritual senses into the white light to examine the treasures.  Qin Sang had just sent a strand of his spiritual sense when a domineering consciousness, completely unrestrained, swept across the feathers, causing other spiritual senses to hesitate.</p><p>“Great Saint Tianpeng?”</p><p>The thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind as his spiritual sense examined the feathers.  The star feathers were imperfect, their spiritual essence diminished, making them difficult to refine into artifacts—clearly designed to attract妖族 (yaozu – rendered as “demon race” for clarity) participants.  However, Qin Sang scanned them repeatedly, finding nothing unusual about the so-called true blood.</p><p>“The three star feathers must be traded together for at least a high-grade wood-attribute artifact with healing properties.  If the healing effect is exceptionally strong, the grade requirement can be lowered.”</p><p>Before the words faded, a voice from a darkened bamboo house announced, “I'll take the star feathers.  Here’s a high-grade wooden flute crafted from the main root of a Drunken Cloud Tree.”</p><p>A white light illuminated another bamboo house, revealing a mottled wooden flute—invisible to all but the star feather owner.</p><p>“Are there any other cultivators willing to bid?”</p><p>After a pause, the star feather owner asked, and receiving no response, said, “Deal!”</p><p>Two balls of white light, each containing the traded items, flew into their respective bamboo houses.</p><p>Transactions didn't need to be finalized immediately.  Dissatisfied parties could leave their items on display for later trades, hoping for a better opportunity.  Commission for the Wanmo Assembly would be collected at the end of the exchange.</p><p>Throughout the process, the Venerable Chongtai remained silent, his face brightening at the smooth first transaction. His ears twitched slightly before he announced, “Next!”</p><p>The bamboo house retreated into the shadows, replaced by another.</p><p>“Skyfall Iron, suitable for refining cold-attribute artifacts…”</p><p>“Cold Bone Devil Hand, an ancient cold bone devil artifact of high grade, activated with refined blood, possessing the power of an apex artifact…”</p><p>…</p><p>One after another, rarely seen treasures took the stage.  Some were traded; others remained on display, awaiting buyers.</p><p>“‘Seven Masters’ Buddha Seal, a Buddhist physical cultivation technique…”</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang’s anticipated ‘Seven Masters’ Buddha Seal appeared.  He held the jade token, observing a jade slip floating before the central bamboo house.  A Yuan Ying-level physical cultivation technique, a rare item even at past Wanmo Assemblies. Qin Sang keenly sensed fluctuations of spiritual sense from several bamboo houses, indicating significant interest in the technique.</p><p>“Hopefully, Great Saint Tianpeng doesn't intervene.”</p><p>Qin Sang reviewed his assets, lacking confidence in competing with a demon race Great Saint.</p><p>Then, after a brief introduction by the owner of the ‘Seven Masters’ Buddha Seal, a hesitant voice declared: “I’ll exchange it for a top-tier earth-attribute evasion technique.”</p><p>This announcement caused a stir.</p><p>“Are you joking?  A physical cultivation technique for a top-tier evasion technique?”</p><p>Someone blurted out, their tone, despite its evenness, betrayed their incredulity.  If the owner hadn’t exaggerated the ‘Seven Masters’ Buddha Seal’s value, the exchange might be equitable.  But the reality was that physical cultivators were nearly extinct.</p><p>Then, a voice rang out from the bamboo building where Xing Yu had just been sold, "Friend, why not allow us to examine a portion of the contents to assess its value? We can't simply take your word for it."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened.</p><p>The demons definitely have ulterior motives!</p><p>The owner of the "Seven Master Buddha Seals" did not respond to the questioning, simply saying, "Fine!"</p><p>One after another, divine senses probed into the jade slip, all deeply curious about the physical cultivation technique.</p><p>Only a portion of the general outline of the jade slip was revealed.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned the entire contents.</p><p>The "Seven Master Buddha Seals" were actually seven types of Buddhist hand seals.  According to the general outline, each seal was extremely powerful and forceful, with remarkable power.</p><p>However, using this technique would place an immense burden on the cultivator's physical body; only pure physical cultivators could withstand it.</p><p>A physical cultivator below the Yuan Ying stage could barely use the first seal; a cultivator at the early Yuan Ying stage could only use the first four.</p><p>This alone demonstrated the extraordinary nature of the "Seven Master Buddha Seals."</p><p>While these thoughts flashed through his mind, Qin Sang also secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Because, according to the general outline, this technique was specifically created based on human characteristics.  Even if demons forcibly used it, the power of the Buddha seals would clash with their bloodline, harming themselves before harming others, greatly reducing its effectiveness.</p><p>Tian Peng Da Sheng probably wouldn't actively participate in the bidding war.</p><p>Otherwise, the owner of the "Seven Master Buddha Seals" wouldn't have hesitated when proposing the conditions.</p><p>The problem now was that Qin Sang didn't have a top-tier earth-elemental escape technique. What could he use to persuade the other party?</p><p>A moment of silence fell on Lake Heart Island.</p><p>Then, a voice suddenly rang out, "I heard that an ancient Buddhist sect relic surfaced two years ago.  Friend, you must have obtained the 'Seven Master Buddha Seals' from there, correct?"</p><p>Pausing, seeing that the owner of the "Seven Master Buddha Seals" did not reply, the person continued, "May I ask if you possess any other Buddhist cultivation methods or techniques?  Let's exclude those related to physical cultivation."</p><p>Buddhist sect members?</p><p>Everyone looked in the direction of the voice, but saw only darkness.</p><p>There's no news of any Buddhist sect with a Yuan Ying stage master, it is likely they commissioned a Yuan Ying stage cultivator to purchase it on their behalf.</p>
