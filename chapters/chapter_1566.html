<h1>Chapter 1557: Corpse Flame Moths</h1><p>Two mountains stand close together, resembling a cuddling couple from a certain angle.</p><p>Local cultivators call them the Male and Female Mountains.</p><p>Entering the basin through the mountain pass of the Male and Female Mountains is one of the safe routes discovered by local cultivators over countless years. A group of low-level cultivators gather on the mountains.</p><p>The basin's miasma rises regularly at night and falls back during the day.</p><p>Night is the most dangerous time.</p><p>At sunset, they flee the basin and wait for sunrise on the Male and Female Mountains. Those with higher cultivation or those who have prepared antidotal elixirs can withstand the miasma for a longer time, but even they must come out to rest after a while.</p><p>The Male and Female Mountains were once glorious, once forming a sizable market town.  As the resources in this area were depleted, it gradually declined, and the trading guilds moved elsewhere.</p><p>Now, only these low-level cultivators remain, eking out a living.</p><p>The old splendor is gone.</p><p>They entered the dilapidated market town, found a few empty houses, took out various bottles and jars and herbs, brewed them into medicine, and each person drank a bowl.  Immediately, they sweated profusely, dispelling the miasma in their bodies.</p><p>They had performed similar actions countless times, becoming very skilled.</p><p>Refreshed, they chatted and laughed, sorting through their harvest.</p><p>"Sigh! The herbs around the Male and Female Mountains are getting scarcer. This time's harvest is only 80% of the last. At this rate, when will we be able to exchange for a Spirit Transformation Powder?"</p><p>The leader, a strong man, looked dejected.</p><p>"Heh heh, even with Spirit Transformation Powder, to break through to the tenth level of Qi Refinement, we still need to gather spirit stones to buy Foundation Establishment Pills, and one might not even guarantee a breakthrough.  Even you, boss, find it so difficult, we dare not even dream of it.  Just earn some savings, go home and marry eight or ten wives, and be content with relying on luck to have a talented child," someone chimed in.</p><p>"That's not difficult. If we find a Spirit Illusion Flower, we'll be rich, and several Foundation Establishment Pills will be within reach.  There's a legend that a guy got an extremely high-quality Spirit Illusion Flower seed, and the trading guild that took it resold it to some big shot, the price multiplying dozens of times.  Even so, that guy made a fortune and moved his whole family away," the number two in the group said enviously.</p><p>Someone beside him scoffed, "Second Brother, stop talking nonsense.  The Spirit Illusion Flower is indeed precious, but it only appears when the miasma is at its strongest.  With our cultivation, we wouldn't know how we'd even die going in..."</p><p>Before he finished speaking,</p><p>The door creaked open from the outside, and two people walked in.</p><p>Everyone was startled, raising their magic weapons, on high alert.</p><p>The leader scrutinized the uninvited guests, growing increasingly alarmed. He calmed his companions, stepped forward, and clasped his hands, saying, "Meeting is fate.  It's cold at night. If you two friends are looking for a place to stay, I'll have my brothers share a room with you."</p><p>The newcomers were Qin Sang and Lu Zhang.</p><p>Lu Zhang was eager to find the stone toad's trail and didn't bother with pleasantries. He merely released a wisp of true energy, and the group instantly collapsed, leaving only the terrified leader.</p><p>"Where did you say the Spirit Illusion Flowers appear?"</p><p>The leader's legs were weak, his voice trembling, "Reporting to senior, we only heard rumors.  They say that the location changes each time, but it's roughly in the center of the basin. If senior wants to find out the exact location, there's a market town eight hundred li to the west; someone there must know…"</p><p>Lu Zhang nodded slightly, tossed the leader a few spirit stones, and turned to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered something and interjected, "Do you know what god the nearby villages worship?"</p><p>The leader thought for a moment and cautiously replied, "Senior is referring to the Gu God Cult, right? I've heard of it; it's just something those merchants use to make money, fooling ordinary people. They spread the Gu God Cult everywhere, using it to sell herbs with hallucinogenic effects at high prices to those villages… We don't believe in it."</p><p>No wonder those villagers are so fervent.</p><p>Using hallucinogenic herbs, their bodies are affected by the medicine over many years.  Combined with psychological suggestion, even the simplest talisman water can have an effect later on.</p><p>If they consumed such drugs daily, the villagers' bodies would have collapsed long ago.</p><p>Spread only among the commoners, yet the upper echelons have Yuan Ying protectors.</p><p>Such a division, are they really the same force?</p><p>Qin Sang felt strange.</p><p>The two left the Male and Female Mountains, entered the market town, made some inquiries, and then, braving the heavy miasma, entered the basin without delay.</p><p>The intervals between the stone toad emerging to absorb purple qi can sometimes be as long as several decades.</p><p>Lu Zhang judged that the stone toad was nearing maturity and could transform and escape at any moment; they couldn't afford to wait idly above ground.</p><p>The area where the stone toad dispersed its spores was relatively large, meaning its main body must be hidden somewhere within.  The search area was considerable, requiring a thorough search, with no certainty whether it was on the surface or underground.</p><p>It was said that the basin below was riddled with interconnected tunnels, the source of the miasma, and extremely dangerous.</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>Qin Sang and Lu Zhang plunged directly into the ground.  The miasma hit them immediately. They activated their true essence, forming a protective barrier. Looking up, the thick miasma completely blocked out the moonlight.</p><p>Both their vision and spiritual senses were affected.</p><p>Based on gathered information, Lu Zhang marked out an approximate area.  He sped through the miasma, reaching his target and producing the Treasured Bell.</p><p>*Ting…Ting…Ting…*</p><p>The bell's sound echoed unusually clear in the vast basin.</p><p>A halo of treasure light spread far and wide.</p><p>Lu Zhang could contain the bell’s sound locally, but couldn’t mask the treasure light’s fluctuations, as doing so would negate the bell's ability to dispel illusions.</p><p>Ordinary treasures couldn't penetrate the stone toad's disguise.</p><p>They had contacted several trading companies along the way, but hadn't found any suitable magical artifacts, so they had to rely on the Treasured Bell.  They decided against splitting up; one would operate the bell while the other kept watch, taking turns.</p><p>Lu Zhang held the Treasured Bell, nodded to Qin Sang, and began the search.</p><p>Maintaining a distance of several meters, Qin Sang, taking advantage of Lu Zhang’s distraction, deactivated her protective barrier and deliberately drew a wisp of miasma into her body.</p><p>The miasma circulated within her, but Qin Sang felt no significant discomfort.</p><p>Clearly, the miasma primarily harmed the physical body; her transformed body, being of spirit wood, was largely immune to this damage.</p><p>This was a significant advantage for their mission.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that finding the stone toad on the surface was unlikely; they would have to delve underground.</p><p>The confined underground environment, being the source of the miasma, would place a considerable burden on them—resisting the miasma while maintaining the Treasured Bell.  Not to mention the poisonous beasts and insects that the bell’s vibrations might attract, bringing them into conflict.</p><p>Aside from them, few dared to venture deep into the basin at this time.</p><p>They searched the entire night without encountering a third person.</p><p>During this time, many poisonous creatures were attracted, but Qin Sang easily disposed of them.</p><p>By the next morning, the miasma began to recede, though even at its lowest point, a layer remained on the ground, leaving their task no less challenging.</p><p>However, they proceeded more cautiously than during the night.</p><p>They had ascertained that while this wasn't the cultivation ground of some powerful cultivator, Nanzhou had plenty of Yuan Ying-level forces, and making too much noise would attract unwanted attention.</p><p>After taking turns several times, they finally completed their surface search, as expected finding no trace of the stone toad.  They ended up at the entrance to an underground passage.</p><p>The entire basin was full of such entrances, covered by decaying vegetation; removing the cover revealed them, ranging from narrow fissures to openings large enough for dozens of people.</p><p>Each entrance was filled with miasma, which gushed out continuously at night.</p><p>"Let's go down from here,"</p><p>Lu Zhang said.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, handing the Treasured Bell to Lu Zhang and taking out spirit stones to replenish her true essence.</p><p>They chose a passage of moderate width.  It was said that the underground tunnels were all interconnected, rarely presenting dead ends, making the entry point irrelevant.</p><p>Even during the day, few cultivators dared to enter the underground tunnels.</p><p>The true depth of the underground passages remained undetermined.</p><p>Qin Sang and Lu Zhang prepared to measure it themselves.</p><p>They chose a direction, traversing numerous passages, continuously descending, losing track of their depth, until they reached a passage that seemed to have no end.</p><p>Here, the miasma was as thick as water, like a subterranean miasma river.</p><p>Qin Sang fared better, but Lu Zhang needed to expend more true essence to resist the miasma.</p><p>"Ugh!"</p><p>Qin Sang felt a headache coming on.  "To thoroughly search this area will likely take two or three months.  Let's hope the stone toad hasn't moved."</p><p>Lu Zhang hadn't anticipated such trouble.  He sighed, "Before maturity, stone toads move only by instinct, not quickly, and generally won't leave the nest where they were born… this will delay Daoist quite some time."</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head.  "Since I've promised Daoist Lu, I will certainly see this through to the end."</p><p>The two said no more and silently continued their search.</p><p>The underground passages were intertwined.</p><p>Some were straight, others curved, their paths unpredictable.</p><p>Fortunately, both were Yuan Ying cultivators; even complex terrain couldn't confuse them.</p><p>Qin Sang built a mental map of the terrain.</p><p>Day after day, the map grew more complete, the passages becoming clearer.</p><p>A month passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Having searched nearly half the area, they still hadn't found the stone toad, but both were resolute and their determination remained unshaken.</p><p>They did have some gains.</p><p>Qin Sang obtained many remains of poisonous beasts and insects, as well as poisonous pills, to see if the fat silkworm would enjoy them.</p><p>Lu Zhang, seeing Qin Sang's interest in the objects, gave them all to him.</p><p>The two traversed a long, winding tunnel, several thousand meters in length.  It ended at a stone passage, the widest they had encountered during their journey.</p><p>Lu Zhang made a brief observation before activating the Treasured Bell and entering the stone passage first. Qin Sang followed close behind.</p><p>The bell's light illuminated one side of the stone walls, its sound echoing only around them.  They proceeded silently, like travelers with lanterns.</p><p>After a while, suspicion flickered in Qin Sang's eyes. He abruptly stopped Lu Zhang.  "Lu Daoyou, something's not right. We've been walking for a long time, and haven't seen a single venomous insect or beast."</p><p>Lu Zhang halted, his expression turning grave.  Based on their experience, this could only mean one thing: they were near the lair of a powerful insect or beast king, its territory unapproachable to others.</p><p>The strongest venomous creature they had encountered thus far was a mid-stage demonic python.  Could this be the lair of a transformed beast, or even a fourth-stage spirit insect?</p><p>Any creature inhabiting this place would most likely possess exceptional poison control abilities, making them far more dangerous in this unique environment.  They dared not underestimate the threat.</p><p>Lu Zhang reduced the Treasured Bell's range.  Qin Sang gripped his Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade.</p><p>They continued for some distance without incident.  Just as they were nearing the end of the stone passage, a faint rustling sound emerged from the depths of the miasma—a subtle scratching, like scales scraping against the ground.</p><p>Lu Zhang reacted instantly, pressing down on the Treasured Bell. Qin Sang stopped in his tracks.</p><p>They exchanged a look, communicating briefly through mental transmission. Lu Zhang would scout ahead, while Qin Sang held his blade, ready to unleash his Xuan Qi.</p><p>They advanced, and soon saw a dim, flickering light ahead.  A few steps further, the source became clear: a ball of flame.</p><p>The flame, hovering on the ground, pulsed and contracted. It enveloped a venomous spider, roughly the size of a human head, weak and near death.  The flame burned through the spider's carapace.</p><p>The spider writhed in agony but couldn't escape the flames, its flesh consumed in an instant, leaving only its shell behind.</p><p>Lu Zhang frowned, unable to recall the origin of this flame.</p><p>"Corpse Flame Moths!" Qin Sang exclaimed, recognizing the insect from his extensive collection of insect-control manuals. Like the Rotting Phosphorus Fireflies, Corpse Flame Moths were social spirit insects; their flickering light—actually poisonous powder—was their camouflage.</p><p>The flame detached itself from the spider's remains.  Within the light, dozens of small, yellow moths huddled together, forming the heart of the flame.</p><p>"How many Corpse Flame Moths are there?" Lu Zhang asked gravely.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated.  "It's difficult to say.  At least hundreds, perhaps…"</p><p>Before he could finish, the miasma ahead surged, and countless dim lights ignited—thousands of them, at least, visible to the naked eye. Only a place like this poisonous swamp could nurture such a large colony.</p><p>"They've spotted us," Lu Zhang declared, a radiant aura erupting from his body, sweeping the surrounding area. "Poison dust!"</p><p>A deafening buzzing filled the confined space, a sound that seemed to pierce their eardrums.  Instantly, all the lights converged and lunged at them, instinctively devouring any living being in their path.</p><p>The stone passage blazed with light.  An endless torrent of poison dust swept down.  Unbelievable that such weak creatures could unleash such a devastating attack.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang vibrated his wrist, sending a wave of icy energy from his blade, creating a path of frost. The sharp energy effortlessly cleaved the flames in two.  The frozen moth corpses scattered on the ground, but the swarm pressed on, relentless.</p><p>Lu Zhang acted just as swiftly, a green light flashing from his brow before engulfing his entire body, then shielding Qin Sang within a protective, jade-green bell. The bell's aura repelled the insects, aiding the blade in splitting the swarm.</p><p>As they battled the swarm...</p><p>Deep beneath the earth...</p><p>In the unknown...</p><p>A furious growl echoed in the darkness.</p>
