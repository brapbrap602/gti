<h1>Chapter 1908: The Daoist Descends the Mountain</h1><p>This was a perfect opportunity to take Xiao Wu into the world, allowing her to experience worldly affairs and test her own perceptions.</p><p>Qin Sang considered this.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat quietly, her dark eyes fixed only on Qin Sang, her master, showing no interest in anything else.  She only glanced at Zhuque when it flitted near her, behaving exceptionally well.</p><p>But this very behavior was unsettling.</p><p>A ‘baby’ newly born, everything in the world should be new and exciting, inspiring curiosity, not such indifference.</p><p>Zhuque, highly perceptive, sensed this, and quietly returned to Qin Sang’s side, careful not to disturb Xiao Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang made a decision.  He raised a finger, lightly tapping the air before him. Spiritual energy surged, and a Daoist appeared.</p><p>The Daoist resembled Qin Sang, sharing about a third of his features. He wore a square headcloth, stood tall and elegant in a simple green robe and white shoes, exuding an air of transcendence.</p><p>His eyes flickered, bringing his expression to life, adding a certain grace and bearing. He bowed to Qin Sang with an easy, graceful manner.</p><p>At the Refining Void realm, certain things transcend mere ‘techniques.’</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't used any secret arts.</p><p>This was a different application he'd understood through his Dharma body, something akin to the incarnations of gods and immortals in legends.</p><p>An incarnation enters the world while the true body remains in seclusion, allowing both pursuits to proceed simultaneously.</p><p>Of course, the top sects have superior methods for creating incarnations and clones, far surpassing Qin Sang's.</p><p>“Still lacks a certain something…”</p><p>Qin Sang stroked his chin, studying the incarnation. With a thought, the incarnation's features underwent subtle changes, adding a touch of weariness.</p><p>“Now he looks like a wandering Daoist.”</p><p>Qin Sang was satisfied. He gestured with his hand, and a brilliant light in the fire chamber suddenly intensified, flying out on its own and streaking through the air.</p><p>The incarnation turned towards the exit, raising his right hand. The brilliant light precisely entered the cave and landed in the incarnation's hand.</p><p>This treasure was the Earth Travel Boat that Qin Sang had obtained from the remains of the demonic Peng.</p><p>Then, a green light flashed from Qin Sang, revealing a human-shaped spirit wood—the Evolution Tree, refined using the *Post-Heaven Wooden Man Stele*.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Evolution Tree entered the incarnation's body.  The incarnation’s form immediately solidified, seeming to possess a genuine flesh-and-blood body.</p><p>This incarnation only had the power of a Divine Transformation cultivator, but it could manipulate the natural energy to a certain extent, something that ordinary Divine Transformation cultivators could only borrow from Heaven's might.</p><p>With the help of the Evolution Tree, it could unleash even greater strength in places rich with spirit wood energy.</p><p>Plus, Xiao Wu would be with him.</p><p>The incarnation would enter the world for training, and beyond a certain distance from the Daoist temple, the return-to-origin technique would become unusable.  However, Qin Sang's main body could still sense the incarnation's experiences.</p><p>If any accident occurred, his true body would sense it immediately.  And since it was a journey into the mortal realm, Qin Sang felt confident that there would be no problems.</p><p>“Take these as well…”</p><p>Qin Sang's consciousness entered his dantian, sensing the Five Thunder Envoy’s seal. He made copies of the scriptures and secret manuals within, transforming them into a ray of light, which he sent into the incarnation's brow.</p><p>While the incarnation traveled down the mountain, he could use his spare time to study thunder techniques.</p><p>In the future, Daoist thunder techniques might become a vital asset for him.</p><p>“I’m going too! I’m going too!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's actions, Zhuque guessed what he was planning and immediately lit up, eager to join them.</p><p>The area was filled with lava and fire seas, normally deserted, and Qin Sang was always in seclusion. Zhuque could only search for treasures around the area with the fire jade centipede, finding the isolation tedious.</p><p>A trip down the mountain, such fun, how could it miss out?</p><p>The creature was completely focused on anything but cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, saying, “Conceal your feather patterns, and I might consider bringing you down.”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Zhuque hopped to the doorway, looking wary.</p><p>Its most distinctive feature compared to other fire crows was its unique and beautiful patterns, which it often admired.</p><p>Concealing those would make it just as ugly as any other fire crow.</p><p>“Then you stay on the mountain and keep the fire jade centipede company!”</p><p>Qin Sang showed no mercy, waving his hand, and the stone door slammed shut with a *bang*.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Luo Hou and Gui Hou, while training their demonic soldiers, sensed a shift in energy from the mountaintop, and looked up.  They saw a Daoist emerge from the cave on the peak.</p><p>The Daoist held a little girl's hand, moving swiftly down the mountain on a cloud, landing by the lake.</p><p>Zhuque flew excitedly around them.</p><p>“Accompany them down the mountain.”</p><p>Luo Hou heard Qin Sang's voice and without hesitation, respectfully replied, "As you command."</p><p>Luo Hou created a demonic wind, swiftly catching up and settling beside the Daoist.</p><p>Luo Hou, a creature of the Shadow Horse lineage, possessed the awakened bloodline of the Azure Lightning Beast.  Its body was covered in azure scales, with lightning flickering between them, making it far larger and more powerful than a typical Shadow Horse.</p><p>A flash of azure light.</p><p>Luo Hou concealed its scales and lightning, its divine aura receding, its form shrinking to become a majestic azure horse.  It stamped its hooves on the ground, snorting.</p><p>Qin Sang had subdued Luo Hou, intending to use it to help navigate the dangerous Mount Ju and its altar. He'd promised to help it find a suitable physical form, but unforeseen events delayed this until now.  He took it down the mountain with him.</p><p>Gui Hou’s eyes flickered with envy. Luo Hou had become the mount of their master's physical form, a privilege envied by all.</p><p>Without the master's permission, it could only watch with longing.</p><p>However, remaining on the mountain as a guardian beast wasn't without its advantages. Occasional guidance from the master significantly benefited its cultivation.</p><p>Over a hundred years ago, this had enabled Gui Hou to break through to the mid-Metamorphosis stage.</p><p>Gui Hou, lying on a grey stone at the foot of the mountain, watched Luo Hou depart, lost in thought.</p><p>On the mountaintop,</p><p>Tian Mu Die, having reached the late Fifth Transformation stage, stood on Qin Sang's shoulder, watching the departing figures.</p><p>In the setting sun,</p><p>A man held a young girl's hand, seemingly walking slowly, yet each step covered a hundred yards.</p><p>An azure horse followed closely behind, needing no lead.</p><p>A restless fire crow hopped between the horse's head and the man's shoulder, incessantly chattering, disrupting the tranquil scene.</p><p>The man, the girl, the bird, and the horse –</p><p>gradually disappeared into the distant mountains.</p><p>…</p><p>In the south, in the mortal realm,</p><p>They traveled southwards at a leisurely pace, without using any special movement techniques.</p><p>The land was indeed sparsely populated.  For a long time, they saw no one. Only a few times did they sense faint auras in the mountains, likely cultivators in seclusion.</p><p>Continuing south, the subterranean fire veins grew calmer, and the landscape began to change. The ever-present flames were weakening.</p><p>Further on, they would transition from the dense network of lava rivers to a similarly desolate desert.</p><p>They should soon encounter signs of human activity.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly stopped. Xiao Wu, noticing this, also stopped, tilting its little head in question.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't spoken much during this journey, and Xiao Wu patiently followed, never initiating conversation.</p><p>Qin Sang lifted Xiao Wu onto the horse's back, gently closing its eyes.  "Xiao Wu," he instructed, "Don't open your eyes from now on, and call me Master in front of others."</p><p>Xiao Wu showed no resistance, closing its eyes and softly saying, "Master."</p><p>Zhu Que, perched on the horse's head, nodded off, its head bobbing. The conversation jolted it awake.  It opened its beak to speak, but Qin Sang's sharp gaze stopped it.</p><p>"There are no outsiders here, why can't this Zhu Que speak...?"</p><p>Zhu Que mumbled softly.</p><p>Before leaving the mountain, Qin Sang had given it numerous rules, including not speaking casually.</p><p>To have some fun, it had to endure this humiliation!</p><p>…</p><p>The wind carried sand like blades.</p><p>Waves of deadly heat, driven by the fierce north wind, scorched the fragile vegetation.  The surrounding area was nothing but endless sand; not a single oasis could be found.</p><p>Mortal beings would find survival impossible here.</p><p>However, for cultivators, this heat was insignificant.</p><p>Located on the edge of the Fire Domain, this place was far less dangerous than the domain itself, yet it offered easy access for treasure hunting, making it the ideal location to settle.</p><p>For countless years, markets had spontaneously formed here. Over time, those that survived merged into towns, with Si Huo Town retaining its name to this day.</p><p>The town was so named because a fire vein once passed through it, surrounding it on all four sides with fire.  Even after the vein's disappearance, the name remained.</p><p>Cultivators knew Si Huo Town was safe, a gathering place for cultivators from all directions, with their descendants also living within its walls.</p><p>The town bustled with activity.</p><p>Si Huo Town was also surrounded by walls, although these served more as decoration; a large formation was the town's true protector.</p><p>The four gates remained open at all times, allowing free passage.</p><p>"From the looks of it, is the Ember Wind coming?"</p><p>Before the west gate, several people queued to enter the town. Two sensed the approaching heatwave from behind and looked around. One of them spoke.</p><p>The Ember Wind was a natural disaster, a fiery wind from the Fire Domain, like heavenly fire, sweeping across the land.</p><p>Its terrifying appearance was matched only by its dreadful power.</p><p>A powerful Sandstorm, the Jinfeng, would force even Foundation Establishment cultivators to seek shelter in Sihuo Town.</p><p>“No way,” another person shook his head. “I heard that before the last Jinfeng, the horizon was burning red, like fire searing the sky. Cultivators who went into the Firelands to search for treasures fled in panic, swarming into the city.”</p><p>As they spoke, they suddenly noticed something indistinct in the sandstorm in the northwest direction, like figures.</p><p>“Could it be?  Someone actually made it back?”</p><p>The man looked surprised, then saw an unusual sight.</p><p>Upon seeing the small figure on the horse, he frowned and said, “Why would someone bring a child to risk their life here?”</p><p>Sihuo Town is safe, but only within the city walls. A delicate child like that could be shattered to pieces by the aftershocks of a cultivator's battle.</p><p>“Hush!”</p><p>His companion covered his mouth, warning him with a look.</p><p>The newcomers were strangers; who knew what abilities someone who dared to travel the world with a child might possess?  Sihuo Town was full of hidden masters; careless words would bring disaster, something that happened frequently.</p><p>Everyone at the city gate noticed them and silently observed Qin Sang and the child.</p><p>“That’s a fine horse!”</p><p>“Such a spirited girl. Why doesn't she open her eyes?  A pity she's blind…”</p><p>…</p><p>Whispers rippled through the crowd, fleeting and anonymous.</p><p>“Xiao Wu, we’re at Sihuo Town. How do you feel?” Qin Sang asked with a smile.</p><p>“Many people…”</p><p>Xiao Wu, despite her closed eyes, was acutely aware of everything.</p><p>“Yes, all sorts of people,”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, approaching the two who had been discussing them. He bowed and said, “Esteemed fellow cultivators, I'm newly arrived and weary from travel.  Could you tell me where I might find lodging and food?”</p><p>“The largest inn in the city is the Gathering Immortals Inn.  They say their ingredients are all spirit beasts hunted from the Firelands…”</p><p>“The Gathering Immortals Inn also has private rooms, but they're quite expensive…”</p><p>The two men gave Qin Sang directions.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked them and quietly joined the queue.</p><p>“Truly a master!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang head straight for the Gathering Immortals Inn, the two exchanged a glance. They couldn't sense his aura; either he had a concealment treasure or his cultivation was far beyond theirs.</p><p>Anyone could enter the city as long as they paid the spirit stones.</p><p>Qin Sang encountered no difficulties, leading his horse into the city, through the streets and alleys, towards the Gathering Immortals Inn.</p><p>The Gathering Immortals Inn lived up to its name.  In the heart of Sihuo Town, besides some secluded mansions, stood the inn; ordinary people were not allowed inside.  While the heat was intense outside the walls, here there were streams and bridges, and the inn was surrounded by beautiful scenery.</p><p>As Qin Sang arrived, the innkeeper quickly approached them. He gently lifted Xiao Wu from the horse.</p><p>The attendant deftly took the reins, saying warmly, “Will you be staying overnight or just dining, esteemed guests? I can take your spirit steed to the stables.”</p><p>A cultivator’s mount would not be an ordinary horse. Many guests brought spirit beasts with them, and the inn had procedures for this.</p><p>Qin Sang, holding Xiao Wu’s hand, glanced inside. The first floor was a large hall, like an ordinary inn, with tables and chairs where guests were drinking and chatting. Even cultivators enjoyed company. From the second floor upwards were private rooms.  The inn was built with spirit arrays, allowing the rooms to transform into different scenes; guests could even hold a feast in the sky, enjoying celestial delights.</p><p>Qin Sang and Xiao Wu’s arrival attracted the attention of some in the hall. Some glanced at them and looked away, while others gazed at the unusual pair with interest.  Even guests in the upper rooms noticed them.</p><p>Third Floor.</p><p>Inside a private room, a celestial cloud and pool had been conjured.  Fine wine and delicacies were spread amidst the mist; the food and drink emanated spiritual energy, and some goblets even glowed crimson, clearly no ordinary objects.</p><p>Several large men were drinking and feasting unrestrainedly. A dozen dancers surrounded them, their movements alluring and suggestive.</p><p>“Second Brother.”</p><p>One lean and shrewd man paused mid-drink, nudging his companion.</p><p>The other wiped his face, the drunkenness gone. He gazed through the array at the inn’s entrance, staring for a moment before asking in a low voice, “Are you sure they’re new faces?”</p><p>“No mistake.  A girl that delicate, if I’d seen this father-daughter pair before, I’d remember.”</p><p>The shrewd man said confidently.</p><p>…</p><p>“Our business has arrived…”</p><p>A subtle smile played on Qin Sang’s lips as he sent a message to Xiao Wu.  The inn’s meager array couldn’t block his perception.</p><p>Xiao Wu remained uncomprehending.</p><p>“No need. We’re going to the Firelands to search for medicine, so we'll only rest briefly before leaving. Please prepare some high-quality spirit beast meat for my steed,” Qin Sang shook his head and led Xiao Wu into the Gathering Immortals Inn.</p>
