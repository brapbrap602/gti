<h1>Chapter 1675: Contesting the Crossing</h1><p>As time passed, the Sky Hao Ancient Mirror was no longer merely touching the surface of the seal but had become fully embedded within it, continuously sinking deeper.  Surprisingly, this process didn't stir any ripples or counterattacks from the seal, proceeding as smoothly and silently as the gentle rain nourishing the earth, a testament to the mirror's profound mystical power.</p><p>When the Sky Hao Ancient Mirror penetrated the seal's interior, the sight within was unexpected.  Instead of the anticipated vibrant colors, it was a world devoid of light.</p><p>Dark, oppressive.</p><p>Through the Sky Hao Ancient Mirror, this sensation transmitted to Fan Laomo's mind and spirit, making him secretly apprehensive.</p><p>Soon, the Sky Hao Ancient Mirror’s reflection revealed that this wasn't pure darkness.  There was a light source.  At the heart of the darkness, a single point of light flickered.</p><p>Its colors were fivefold, resonating with the seal.</p><p>The Sky Hao Ancient Mirror immediately moved towards it, and the reflection of a five-colored crown appeared.</p><p>The mirror stopped beside the five-colored crown.  The Nether Lotus within the mirror's surface slowly drifted outwards. As the Nether Lotus drifted, its closed petals unfolded layer by layer, resuming its Myriad Illusions Nether Lotus form.</p><p>At the lotus's heart, a mass of black Qi fluctuated erratically, gradually coalescing into a human silhouette.  It was Fan Laomo!</p><p>At this moment, Fan Laomo's state was quite peculiar.  It wasn't his true body that had entered, but a Phantom Devil body conjured through a secret technique, possessing the mirror.  He had used the Sky Hao Mirror as a vessel to bring his Phantom Devil body inside.</p><p>Although it wasn't his true body, and thus subject to certain limitations, many mystical abilities could still be performed by this Phantom Devil body.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Fan Laomo opened his eyes, which were pitch black, with what seemed like two Nether Lotuses within his pupils.</p><p>“Is this the spirit treasure?”</p><p>His black eyes shifted, a hint of doubt in Fan Laomo's gaze.  Here, the Five Elements converged, their energies chaotic.  His gaze fell upon the five-colored crown. Just as he was about to carefully analyze its patterns, he suddenly saw the crown tremble.</p><p>Five-colored radiance instantly illuminated all directions. Fan Laomo had a feeling that although the crown's outward appearance hadn't changed, it was completely different from before.  A supreme treasure was awakening.</p><p>In fact, Fan Laomo distinctly felt something awakening within the five-colored crown…</p><p>This something seemed to be… consciousness!</p><p>Consciousness… awakening?</p><p>This unprecedented sensation left Fan Laomo momentarily stunned.  Then, the feeling became even clearer, definitely not an illusion. In a single instant, perhaps even less, a more tangible sensation emerged.</p><p>It was the feeling of being watched!</p><p>The source of the ‘gaze’ was the five-colored crown.</p><p>The Phantom Devil body, impervious to heat and cold, shivered violently at this moment.  A chill pierced through his crown, almost making him cry out in alarm, “Spirit Tool!”</p><p>A Spirit Tool!</p><p>The five-colored crown had actually birthed a Spirit Tool!</p><p>In truth, the Sky Hao Ancient Mirror of the Sky Hao Tower and the Eight Scenery Palace Lantern of the Eight Scenery View were both spirit treasures. The presence or absence of a spirit treasure to suppress a sect's destiny was also one of the hallmarks of a top-tier sect.  Naturally, the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery was no exception.</p><p>However, spirit treasures not only varied in power, but also in strength.</p><p>Spirituality was a crucial factor in distinguishing the strength of spirit treasures.</p><p>When spirituality reached its peak and a Spirit Tool was born, it marked a further transformation of the spirit treasure.</p><p>The Sky Hao Ancient Mirror and the Eight Scenery Palace Lantern had never directly clashed, and neither sect would voluntarily reveal their secrets. However, it was certain that they were both still far from birthing a Spirit Tool.</p><p>The timeframe was difficult to estimate, potentially hundreds or thousands of years, or perhaps a Spirit Tool would never be born.</p><p>Even when spirituality reached its peak, it remained in a chaotic state and might not necessarily give rise to a spirit. This stage was known as the Spirit Molding stage, its difficulty comparable to a cultivator breaking through a major realm bottleneck.</p><p>Perhaps even more difficult!</p><p>Of course, Fan Laomo gleaned this knowledge from ancient texts collected by his sect. Cultivators in the Middle Continent were as numerous as the carp crossing the river, with no shortage of Soul Transformation experts, yet there were no clear records of a spirit treasure molding a spirit.</p><p>In this world, very few cultivators possessed spirit treasures.  Those at the late Nascent Soul stage, like himself, were still using various secret techniques to enhance their natal magic treasures into pseudo-spirit treasures, striving towards true spirit treasure status.</p><p>Who would dare to yearn for the unattainable Spirit Tool?</p><p>At this moment, amidst his shock, Fan Laomo suddenly understood what the Formless Immortal Sect had sealed within Mount Di Shou.</p><p>It was to suppress a Spirit Tool!</p><p>Even spirit treasures would actively choose their masters and require the "Treasure Mastery Canon" to control them.  Since a Spirit Tool existed, how could it willingly submit to a cultivator's enslavement?</p><p>Back then, during the Demonic Tribulation, whenever the Formless Immortal Sect wielded this treasure, it was always accompanied by grand formations.  Thinking back now, although the formations differed each time, they all subtly aligned with the Dao of the Five Elements.</p><p>Presumably, this was partly to control the treasure and partly to suppress the Spirit Tool, preventing it from causing havoc.</p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts flashed through his mind.  Fan Laomo believed he had grasped the truth, but his mind and spirit remained tense, feeling the Spirit Tool's gaze.</p><p>The emotion of rage was palpable.</p><p>This was the accumulated fury from repeated failures in its schemes, from being manipulated, and from realizing something was amiss when the Spirit Tool discovered that even its home had been invaded!</p><p>Under the gaze of this enraged ‘eye,’ Fan Laomo's heart pounded.  Seeing the jade pieces on the five-colored crown radiating brilliant light, he suddenly felt a sense of danger.</p><p>Without time to think, he instinctively waved his right hand, and a streak of dark green light shot out.</p><p>Within the light, faintly visible were glittering grains of dark green sand.  A green glow emanated from the surface of the sand, like flickering will-o'-the-wisps, bone-chillingly cold.</p><p>This was a treasure refined by Fan Laomo from various venomous and sinister materials, called the Foul Yin Phosphorus Sand, specifically designed to defile magic treasures.</p><p>When using the Phantom Devil body, he could temporarily transform a treasure connected to his mind and spirit into a mystical ability to bring inside.  Fan Laomo's goal was to seize the spirit treasure and prevent Zhu Wudao from controlling it, thus greatly increasing his power. His first choice was naturally the Foul Yin Phosphorus Sand.</p><p>Although he hadn't anticipated encountering a Spirit Tool, by mistake, the Foul Yin Phosphorus Sand was perfectly suited for this situation. However, Fan Laomo wasn't sure how effective the Foul Yin Phosphorus Sand would be against a Spirit Tool.</p><p>He was even less certain of the power of a five-colored crown that had birthed a Spirit Tool.</p><p>He coveted the five-colored crown, but understood the principle of knowing one's limitations.  He didn't dare to directly seize the treasure, but had to plan cautiously.</p><p>Therefore, as the Foul Yin Phosphorus Sand was unleashed, Fan Laomo retreated towards the Myriad Illusions Nether Lotus.  He didn't want to lose this Phantom Devil body here.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Fan Laomo was very close to the five-colored crown. The Foul Yin Phosphorus Sand instantly enveloped it. The fine sand transformed into specks of foul phosphorus fire, clinging to the surface of the five-colored crown, instantly staining it with blemishes.</p><p>The crown's luster was dimmed, tainted by the dark green, sinister light.</p><p>But at this moment, Fan Laomo's expression drastically changed.</p><p>Just as the Foul Yin Phosphorus Sand was about to hit the five-colored crown, a surge of black tide, hidden for a long time, erupted from beneath the crown. The black tide surged violently, carrying a terrifying demonic intent that chilled even the great devil Fan Laomo to the bone, fiercely impacting the five-colored crown.</p><p>It was this impact that caused the five-colored crown to tremble violently, its five-colored spiritual light flickering. Caught off guard, the Spirit Tool couldn't react in time and was struck by the Foul Yin Phosphorus Sand.</p><p>The black tide was the true master of the seal!</p><p>He had been used!</p><p>Fan Laomo was shocked and furious. It was too late to recall the Foul Yin Phosphorus Sand.  Many doubts arose in his mind.</p><p>What was the relationship between the Spirit Tool and the black tide? If the five-colored crown was part of the seal, why didn't the Spirit Tool counterattack or warn him when he entered the seal?</p><p>…</p><p>On Mount Di Shou.</p><p>Qin Sang tricked and led Poison King away, while his true body relentlessly pursued Kundao.</p><p>The Sun God Tree and the Four Chariots Azure Serpent Seal combined forces for several strikes. Although there was a barrier as a buffer, Kundao was still injured, worsening her condition.</p><p>At the same time, Kundao had to divert her attention to expel the sword intent Qin Sang had left within her body.  This forced her to focus on escaping, with almost no strength to retaliate.</p><p>Although his avatar wasn't by his side, Qin Sang still held the absolute advantage, no longer needing to deliberately maintain the罡 Fire Shield, moving with effortless grace.</p><p>From outside the mountain, one could occasionally see fireworks blooming along the slopes of Mount Di Shou, some crimson, some black.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword hovered upside down above Qin Sang's head, its sword intent continuously accumulating, yet held in check.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Sun God Tree in one hand, and in the other, a Demonic Fire Dragon coiled, launching attacks in turns.</p><p>Ignoring her internal injuries, Kundao focused all her energy on suppressing and expelling the sword intent within her. Finally, before Qin Sang forced her true form to reveal itself, she expelled the last trace of his sword intent.</p><p>Unconsciously letting out a sigh of relief, Kundao abruptly shifted dozens of zhang within the barrier, then froze, as the Demonic Fire Dragon followed close behind.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The violent impact transmitted through the barrier into Kundao's body, further injuring her already battered form.</p><p>It wasn't sword intent!</p><p>How did he find me?</p><p>Kundao was driven to madness, but Qin Sang didn't give her time to think. The Demonic Fire Dragon followed her like a shadow. Her increasingly severe injuries reminded her that this physical body couldn't hold on much longer.</p><p>“The time is ripe.”</p><p>Qin Sang had been constantly assessing Kundao's condition.</p><p>As soon as the thought arose, sword light flashed like a dragon.</p><p>Wherever the Golden Sinking Sword reached, a sword formation reappeared.</p><p>At this moment, something unexpected happened.  A furious roar, filled with rage, suddenly erupted from the barrier. Then, a figure flashed, and Kundao plummeted, her eyes tightly shut, her aura extinguished.</p><p>Caught off guard, Qin Sang almost sliced Kundao into pieces. He quickly diverted the Demonic Fire and retracted his sword energy.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Sword threads wrapped around Kundao's body, floating towards Qin Sang.</p><p>“She’s truly dead…”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly sensed, and Kundao's life force was completely gone.  She was dead. He couldn't help but feel deeply puzzled.</p><p>He hadn't expected Kundao to be so resolute, choosing to commit suicide when the situation turned dire.</p><p>He had patiently pursued her this far, intending to capture her alive.</p><p>Regardless, the most important objective had been achieved. Qin Sang looked at Kundao's waist, snatched the crimson immortal pendant, and immediately felt a surge of blazing sun energy enter his body, making him feel hot all over.</p><p>Its power rivaled the chilling煞 energy of the Mystical Ice Disc.</p><p>“What a treasure!”</p><p>Qin Sang praised, feeling elated.</p><p>With this, the two most important treasures of the Tribulation Transcendence Formation were now in his possession.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Qin Sang swept his divine sense across Kundao's entire body, but couldn't find any storage artifacts like a Mustard Seed Bag.  Could it be that she hadn't gained anything from the medicinal garden?</p><p>Recalling various illogical details, piecing them together, Qin Sang's doubts grew, and he felt Kundao's suicide was increasingly unusual.</p><p>Just then, a furious roar echoed.</p><p>The roar’s origin was unknown.</p><p>It seemed to come from the mountaintop, or perhaps from the barrier itself. It wasn't loud, but it couldn't be ignored, carrying boundless rage that startled anyone who heard it.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, his brows furrowed.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t the only one startled by the roar.</p><p>Behind Qin Sang’s true body.</p><p>Poison King pursued the avatar, quickly realizing he had been tricked.  Sensing the commotion Qin Sang’s true body was creating in the distance, he turned to leave.</p><p>The avatar was more than just bait.</p><p>Just as Poison King made his move, he suddenly felt a chilling sensation. He turned to see an Azure Serpent, wreathed in layers of cold flames, baring its fangs and claws, tearing through the wind煞, pouncing towards him.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Poison King’s face darkened. He waved his hand, and the toxic cloud surrounding him gathered above his head, meeting the Azure Serpent head-on.</p><p>Upon contact, Poison King sensed something was wrong and hurriedly summoned toxic sand, shooting it towards the toxic cloud.  The cloud abruptly contracted, but became several times denser than before.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>The Azure Serpent crashed directly into the toxic cloud.</p><p>The toxic cloud trembled violently, almost torn apart by the Azure Serpent.  But supported by the toxic sand, its structure held, remaining intact. Only the surface layer of toxic mist was assaulted by the cold flames, freezing into toxic ice of various colors.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The toxic ice shattered, and the toxic sand, along with the remaining toxic cloud, shot back.</p><p>Poison King gracefully retreated dozens of zhang, his phoenix eyes narrowing slightly, as he saw the avatar return from the depths of the wind煞.</p><p>“A Spirit Treasure?”</p><p>The first thing Poison King noticed was the Four Chariots Azure Serpent Seal above the avatar’s head.</p><p>The Spirit Treasures in the Middle Continent were well known.</p><p>Poison King mentally reviewed them all but couldn't recognize this one.  The records related to the Formless Immortal Sect didn't mention this Spirit Treasure either. Although the opponent was only at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, wielding a Spirit Treasure made them a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>But why did a mid-Nascent Soul helper suddenly appear beside Qin Sang?</p><p>Recalling the sudden fluctuation he sensed from Qin Sang's side earlier, Poison King’s expression shifted.  “This is… your clone? No, it's an External Avatar!”</p><p>Judging by the avatar’s perfectly unified energy, it was definitely not a mere clone.</p><p>With this, all his questions were answered.</p><p>This person not only possessed exceptional strength in his true body but also had an External Avatar wielding a Spirit Treasure. This explained why the rebel had fallen at his hands.</p><p>“First a late Nascent Soul puppet, then an External Avatar. This place truly is teeming with hidden dragons and crouching tigers…”</p><p>Poison King sighed with a smile, “Fellow Daoist, do you think you can stop me with just an avatar?”</p><p>His identity exposed, the avatar made no further futile attempts at concealment, happy to converse with Poison King and buy time for his true body. He calmly replied, “Why must Poison King be so aggressive?”</p><p>“I only wish for fellow Daoist to give me an answer…”</p><p>Poison King repeated his offer of great rewards.</p><p>“After this matter is concluded, when my true body is free, I will naturally contact fellow Daoist…”</p><p>The avatar’s words were cut short by Poison King.</p><p>“Since the avatar cannot make decisions, I have no choice but to ask fellow Daoist’s true body in person,” Poison King boomed, suddenly transforming into a streak of light and flying away.</p><p>Poison King had already seen that the other party had little intention of returning the Gu King.</p><p>Stopping now would be a joke. Should he wait for the other party to resolve the trouble, return fully loaded, and then leisurely concoct the Gu King? Or should he beg for their charity?</p><p>Only by creating more trouble for them could he seize the initiative!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>As soon as the escaping light appeared, the Azure Serpent swooped down.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Poison King abruptly stopped, feigning escape, turning back to face the avatar, and pouncing towards him with even greater speed.</p><p>The avatar was prepared. His eyes turned completely white, and a beam of pale, chilling light swept down from before him.  Simultaneously, his figure shot backward.</p><p>The Ice Soul Cold Light was like a wall of ice, unleashed without hesitation, forming a barrier.</p><p>The avatar was extremely cautious, not giving Poison King a chance to use the caterpillar-like Gu worm. He only circled at a distance, harassing with the Spirit Treasure and Ice Soul Divine Light, never getting close.</p><p>Although he couldn't stop Poison King, he could still delay him.</p><p>Until the roar echoed, both sides stopped in surprise.</p>
