<h1>Chapter 419:  Crimson Divine Light</h1><p>Chapter 419:  Crimson Divine Light</p><p>The ebony sword, having completely absorbed the Nether Blood Mulberry, was now one with it, transformed into a low-grade magic weapon!</p><p>Its green blade emanated an extreme sharpness; the sword intent on its edge was almost tangible, as if capable of tearing through the void.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the ebony sword with affection, then his eyes turned cold as he fixed his gaze on the blood-red escaping light, his lips forming a single word.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>In an instant, the ebony sword vanished before Qin Sang.</p><p>The next moment, a tremendous roar of thunder shook the heavens.</p><p>The thunder reverberated across the land, possessing earth-shattering power, frightening ghosts and spirits, and shaking the very hearts of men.</p><p>Hearing the thunder, the silver-robed man fleeing in terror was startled, a sudden feeling of impending doom washing over him. He hastily turned his head, only to see a dazzling sword light, hurtling towards him with incredible speed, like a shooting star chasing the moon.</p><p>Such a distance, yet it arrived in the blink of an eye, close at hand.</p><p>The razor-sharp edge of the flying sword carried an unstoppable might, filling the silver-robed man with terror.</p><p>The earth-shattering thunder was precisely caused by this sword light.</p><p>Witnessing this scene, the silver-robed man suddenly recalled a legendary swordsmanship realm – Sword Qi Thunder Sound!</p><p>The sword's path is like lightning, swift as a startled bird.</p><p>Legend holds that even Golden Core cultivators rarely achieve this swordsmanship realm; only sword maniacs or those exceptionally gifted and possessing extraordinary talent have the chance to cultivate it.</p><p>Qin Sang, naturally, did not possess such talent.  He needed to cultivate with every second counting, and could not indulge in the way of the sword, transforming into a sword maniac, immersed in the sword intent day and night.</p><p>Sword Qi Thunder Sound was the second divine ability bestowed upon Qin Sang by the *Meta-Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter*.</p><p>Upon breaking through to the second level of the cultivation method, he gained the Human-Sword Unity and Shadowless Escape divine abilities, helping him overcome numerous crises.</p><p>Several years ago, upon breaking through to the late Foundation Establishment stage and reaching the fourth level, Qin Sang learned the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability.</p><p>After mastering this ability, Qin Sang spent a period of seclusion, carefully comprehending it, and discovered that Sword Qi Thunder Sound truly lived up to its name – incredibly powerful.</p><p>The most terrifying aspect was Sword Qi Thunder Sound's astonishing speed. Coupled with the ebony sword's improved grade as a magic weapon, cultivators of the same realm, if they were too close and overconfident, would be unable to react in any way, their spiritual energy and bodies easily pierced by the ebony sword.</p><p>After understanding Sword Qi Thunder Sound, Qin Sang spared no effort, temporarily halting his cultivation to spend a full year mastering this divine ability.</p><p>This was a powerful divine ability capable of influencing the outcome of a battle even between Golden Core cultivators; thanks to the *Meta-Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter*, Qin Sang mastered it during the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>With Sword Qi Thunder Sound alone, he could easily crush cultivators of the same realm.</p><p>If it weren't for the terrifying after-effects of the *Meta-Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter*, which made it impossible for normal people to successfully cultivate, every disciple of Mount Shao Hua would undoubtedly choose this cultivation method!</p><p>After breaking through to the late Foundation Establishment stage and inscribing the fourth killing talisman onto the ebony sword...</p><p>Qin Sang's understanding of the *Meta-Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter* deepened.  The spiritual sword residing in his meta-spirit, along with the four killing talismans and the sword intent and killing intent emanating from the spiritual sword itself, constantly bombarded his meta-spirit.</p><p>Without the Jade Buddha's protection, Qin Sang would have long since gone mad.</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang admired Senior Qingzhu even more.  Just how much perseverance did Senior Qingzhu possess to withstand the impact of the sword intent and killing talismans with a fragile meta-spirit and still achieve the Mount Shao Hua record of forty years to Golden Core!</p><p>Sword Qi Thunder Sound was already so powerful; just how terrifying would the fifth-level divine ability, Sword Light Division, be?  This thought made Qin Sang even more eager for Golden Core advancement.</p><p>It was only because the silver-robed man fled first, and the distance between them was too great; otherwise, this person would already be a corpse beneath his sword.</p><p>Sword Qi Thunder Sound!</p><p>It was actually Sword Qi Thunder Sound!</p><p>The silver-robed man was filled with terror. He never imagined that his opponent was a freak who had comprehended Sword Qi Thunder Sound at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Throughout the entire Xiao Han domain's cultivation world, it was a legend that very few people had ever understood Sword Qi Thunder Sound at the Foundation Establishment stage; those who did were all famous figures, each leaving behind their own legendary tale.</p><p>At this time, the ebony sword had traveled a great distance, its momentum waning, but the sword light was still dazzling, bringing with it the aura of death.</p><p>In his terror, the silver-robed man hurriedly threw out all the talismans from his pouch, simultaneously summoning a wicker basket.</p><p>For a moment, various incantations blazed, the air shimmering with colorful light, a truly spectacular sight. However, against the ebony sword, these incantations posed virtually no obstacle, shattered as if by a powerful force.</p><p>"Another magic weapon!"</p><p>The silver-robed man's eyes widened in disbelief; he felt like he was going mad.</p><p>My master, Jiupao Daoren, was a highly respected Golden Core cultivator.  Before the destruction of Kuiyin Sect, he was the leader of the third generation of disciples, showered with the sect's favor, yet possessed only two magic treasures.</p><p>He expended immense effort gathering the necessary materials to refine his life-bound treasure.  The other, the Ten Directions Yama Banner, was a legacy from his ancestor.</p><p>This man, clearly a Foundation Establishment cultivator, not only wielded Sword Qi and Thunder Sounds but also possessed two magic treasures – and even more strangely, he could actually use them.</p><p>When did I ever provoke such a formidable individual?</p><p>If he knew that Qin Sang's pouch held a fragment of a magic treasure, one that could be repaired with the right materials, he might just explode in rage.</p><p>The man in silver hastily summoned his magic basket.  Streams of rainbow light shot from it, thousands of auspicious rays filling the sky, entangling the ebony sword.  He hoped to stall the sword while it was exhausted.</p><p>Just as the silver-clad man prepared to burn his essence and flee, a shocking sight unfolded.</p><p>The ebony sword quivered, its green blade suddenly flaring with an unnatural crimson. A beam of blood-red light erupted, striking the magic basket directly.</p><p>Touched by the bloody light, the basket seemed defiled by some foul substance. Its vibrant blossoms withered, the basket itself turning blood-red, its magical properties lost.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The ebony sword pierced straight through.</p><p>“What kind of blood light was that?”</p><p>The thought barely crossed the silver-clad man's mind before a sharp pain shot through his chest.  He looked down to see the ebony sword had pierced his body and spiritual energy.</p><p>Blood sprayed across the sky; his life force was extinguished.</p><p>On the lone peak, Qin Sang dispelled the lingering traces of the battle and swiftly flew into the air.</p><p>He glanced around.  Many faint auras emerged from this mountain range, clearly cultivators in seclusion, disturbed by the clash.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of Foundation Establishment cultivators, but he feared attracting the Golden Core cultivators from Tianyou Pass. He wasn't arrogant enough to challenge them.</p><p>That's why he'd used the ebony sword's Blood Defiling Light ability without hesitation, aiming for a quick resolution.</p><p>The ebony sword, having absorbed the Bloodless Mulberry, gained the Blood Defiling Light ability. It could severely damage the spiritual essence of magic treasures, making short work of mere magic weapons.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Blood Defiling Light could only be used once before needing time to recover.</p>
