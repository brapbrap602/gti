**Chapter 214: Transactions and Requests**

Qin Sang nodded thoughtfully and pondered for a moment before saying, "I can sell them to you. The price will be established according to your rules, but I need some things in return. I must ask you to help collect them diligently."

It was said that this black market auction was held only once a month. With the number of magic artifacts he had, attending just one auction might not be enough to sell them all. He was unwilling to risk any trace of himself being exposed, especially since Yin Xingge had a Core Formation Stage cultivator backing him.

Furthermore, Qin Sang wanted to go to the Tianjing Secret Realm as soon as possible, so he decided to sell them all at once.

Time was the most valuable thing to him. He could accept some losses, especially since the items were essentially free.

The old man's face exuded confidence. "Fellow Daoist, please tell me. As long as it is not something too rare, this old man has a way to obtain it. Of course, this is under the condition that Fellow Daoist can afford it."

Qin Sang stared at the face intently and said in a hoarse voice, "I need a batch of soul-refining magic artifacts. I wonder if your establishment has any channels to acquire them?"

In the Ganyang Quartz Mine, Qin Sang discovered that the Ten Specters Banner could absorb other magic artifacts, which sparked this idea.

After leaving Yuankong Town, Qin Sang had the Ten Specters Banner absorb all the evil spirits in the bracelet. Although it had shown significant improvement, it was still far from the completion of all six Ten Specters Banners.

It was a pity that when they escaped the mine, although they had killed many humanoid cloud beasts and obtained some magic artifacts, they did not find another soul-refining magic artifact. He could only find a way on his own.

The Ten Specters Banner was one of his most important means. Qin Sang had a feeling that if all six Ten Specters Banners reached completion, the power of their formation would surpass that of the Ruyi Jade Talisman, which was of great significance to him.

It was important to note that the Ten Specters Banner would not lose its power after repeated use. It could be used without restraint. Moreover, when arranged in a formation, it was more powerful and versatile than a talisman.

At that time, if he could deploy the Ten Specters Banner in advance, Qin Sang believed he would have the strength to fight against a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.

It was indeed worthy of being a magic artifact derived from the Nascent Soul ancestor's natal magic artifact.

If he could gather ten Specters Banners and set up a complete Ten Specters Banner Formation, its power would rise to another level, possibly reaching the level of two or even three talismans.

Foundation Establishment cultivators could not use magic artifacts. Qin Sang could use the Ten Specters Banner Formation to make up for the gap in cultivation level between him and others.

After weighing the pros and cons, Qin Sang made a decision. He would temporarily put the Ebony Sword aside in favor of the Ten Specters Banner. His assets were limited, and he could only focus on improving one magic artifact.

Using spirit wood to upgrade the Ebony Sword would be expensive but would not have immediate results. The most important goal was to prevent it from becoming a hindrance to his cultivation.

Now it seemed that even if the Ebony Sword could not withstand a second killing talisman, it was not far off. Moreover, it would take a long time before he could break through to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment realm, so there was no rush.

By upgrading the Ten Specters Banner, his strength would also increase, and it might be easier to collect spirit wood.

Of course, it was not that simple to gather ten Ten Specters Banners, so it was too early to say for sure.

Because of the Mind-devouring Worm, Qin Sang did not dare to set foot on the territory of Demonic cultivators in the short term. Even collecting magic artifacts could only be done through the hands of others.

He had already made a plan. After a period of hard cultivation in the Tianjing Secret Realm, when his cultivation level was high enough to gain a foothold in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, he would investigate the whereabouts of the surviving disciples of the Kuiyin Sect while cultivating.

Everything had its pros and cons. The Mind-devouring Worm was indeed a sword hanging over his head, but it might not be a bad thing. It could also be bait for fishing!

Hearing Qin Sang's strange request, the old man's face indeed showed an expression of great astonishment. He looked at Qin Sang in disbelief. "Fellow Daoist, are you interested in magic artifacts?"

"Are you trying to pry into my background?"

Qin Sang narrowed his eyes and snorted coldly. "I heard that your establishment abides by the rules and has an excellent reputation. But now it seems... It may not be entirely true."

The old man's face changed greatly. He hurriedly explained, "Fellow Daoist, do not be angry. This old man was just surprised for a moment and spoke out of turn. I did not mean to pry into Fellow Daoist's background..."

Seeing that Qin Sang had retracted his gaze and was no longer咄咄逼人, the old man's face relaxed slightly. After a moment of contemplation, he said with some difficulty, "Fellow Daoist, the item you seek is not easy to find, even in the territory east of Yinshan Pass. Good soul-refining magic artifacts are extremely difficult to refine in the first place and are very rare. Moreover, they are powerful and are highly sought after in the Demonic realm. It is rare for them to end up outside."

Besides, this is Xianlunguan. It will be really difficult for me to meet your need, fellow daoist…”
Qin Sang chuckled, saying, “I believe that with your power, this store will definitely not disappoint me. Besides, my need can be flexible.”
“Oh?”
The old man looked at Qin Sang with surprise on his face.
“You don’t have to offer complete magic weapons. As long as the soul refining magic weapon which is an evil spirit or demon is still in it, I will also take the damaged ones. And if the damaged magic weapon contains enough remnants of spirits, I am okay to pay the price of an undamaged one.”
Qin Sang said his need in a deep voice.
His actual goal was the damaged magic weapons like the bracelet.
Over the years, the Righteous and Demonic Sects have been incompatible like fire and water. There must be some soul refining magic weapons left when righteous cultivators looted the spoils of war after slaying demonic cultivators.
These types of magic weapons are all quite powerful. Those who looted the complete magic weapons would keep them for their own use, which was what Qin Sang did.
However, the damaged magic weapons are different. To righteous cultivators, these things were like chicken ribs. They could not bear to throw them away, but also could not use them.
First, when using them in a battle, they could not rest assured. They did not know when these things would be destroyed. And they could not be sold for many spirit stones.
Second, each type of soul refining magic weapon had a unique refining method. Only a refiner with very high skills could repair them. That was too costly.
It was difficult for Qin Sang to collect them. It was much easier to use the black market channel. Such damaged magic weapons did not cost a lot. Even if the black market asked for a certain percentage of profit, he could accept.
Upon hearing this, the old man indeed looked less embarrassed. He nodded. “Fellow daoist, this need is not that harsh. I’ll try my best to find them for you. Besides this, is there anything else you need, fellow daoist?”
Qin Sang shook his head, saying, “There isn’t anything else for now. But if we can cooperate well this time, there will be more opportunities in the future. These items… can you please price them for me?”
…
He used to have less than one thousand spirit stones. He spent all of them to prepare cultivation necessities, such as spirit pills and magic weapons, in Xianlunguan. Now, with less than three thousand low-rank spirit stones in his sumeru pouch, Qin Sang finally felt settled.
Qin Sang kept the best pieces of magic weapons for himself. He could sell them for money later if he needed to.
Otherwise, the fortune of three Foundation Establishment cultivators could be sold for more spirit stones.
