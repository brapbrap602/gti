<h1>Chapter 1507: The Deep Valley Seal</h1><p>While Tianpeng the Great Sage and Huangmei the Demon King conversed,</p><p>other demon kings busied themselves around them.</p><p>The assembled demons stood on a jade staircase.</p><p>This was the deepest part of the cloud sea.</p><p>The demons, after considerable effort and overcoming numerous ancient barriers, had finally arrived.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the deep valley was desolate.</p><p>They found no treasure or treasure vault as they had imagined, only a three-tiered jade circular platform of immense size, its full extent impossible to see at a glance.</p><p>Each tier was twice a man's height.  The surface, though lacking intricate patterns or carvings, was constructed of flawless white jade, its purity and beauty accentuated by the surrounding rugged cliffs and scattered rocks.</p><p>From the platform's center erupted a raging inferno, a fiery pillar a hundred meters high.</p><p>This was a type of spiritual fire unlike any they had ever seen—multicolored and strangely cool. Even at the platform's edge, they felt no heat, giving the impression it wasn't truly real.</p><p>After countless years, the fire still burned fiercely, holding everyone in awe.</p><p>It was impossible to imagine the scene back then!</p><p>Initially, the sight of the giant platform and its flames left the demons stunned.  Only after a moment did they remember to approach the top for a closer look.</p><p>The center of the platform was hollow, with just enough room for several to stand side-by-side.</p><p>Looking down, they saw only the roaring flames, unable to penetrate the fiery depths.</p><p>The demons sensed something beneath the flames.  Circling the platform, they found two immensely thick chains descending into the fire.</p><p>Anchored to either side of the platform, the chains seemed to restrain something—an object of unknown material, unscathed by the fire's relentless refinement.</p><p>The demons tried pulling the chains, but to no avail.  Even several demon kings, transforming into their monstrous forms with strength capable of moving mountains, could not budge them.</p><p>In other circumstances, they might have suspected an evil spirit was trapped beneath, thus hesitant to act so rashly.</p><p>However, based on the patterns on the Danxiang Pavilion's alchemy furnace and other findings, they had pinpointed this valley, concluding it was highly likely to contain treasure.</p><p>The platform resembled a giant refining furnace, the flames serving as spiritual fire that had tempered the treasure at the chains' end for countless years.</p><p>What power would this treasure possess once it emerged?</p><p>The thought sent shivers of excitement through them.</p><p>Exploration revealed the platform's flames to be a unique blend of spiritual fire and a form of restrictive energy—a strange force unlike anything they'd encountered.</p><p>This didn't deter them.</p><p>The treasure seemed sealed by the flames.  Continuous assault, scattering the flames and breaking the seal, was likely to release the treasure.</p><p>Realizing this, the previously hostile demons temporarily set aside their differences.  With the treasure still unseen, and the Xuantian Palace lurking nearby, a fight would only benefit no one.</p><p>Led by Tianpeng the Great Sage and Hunmo the Elder, the demons divided, each group taking a chain, and began their work.</p><p>Their efforts proved effective.</p><p>The demons, employing their diverse magical abilities and treasures, relentlessly attacked.  The flames diminished, and the seal weakened.</p><p>The treasure's emergence seemed imminent.</p><p>Even as Tianpeng and Huangmei continued their assault on the flames, the Xuantian Palace arrived—at the worst possible time.</p><p>After a brief pause, Tianpeng transformed into a golden light and circled to the other side of the platform.  The demons along his path ceased their attacks, their faces filled with apprehension.</p><p>Tianpeng went straight to Hunmo the Elder.</p><p>After hearing the news, Hunmo narrowed his eyes, saying coldly, “This valley is fraught with peril; Yin Changsheng won't easily reach here! However, the Xuantian Palace's arrival is unexpected. Opening the Yong'an Pavilion cost considerable time. I thought Yin Changsheng would've been here already.”</p><p>The loss of the Ruyi Lingzhi and inability to control the opening and closing of the stone tablet space left them unable to mask the disturbance caused by its opening.</p><p>An investigation by the Xuantian Palace would easily reveal the anomaly.</p><p>Therefore, upon entering the stone tablet space, the demons focused on treasure hunting instead of infighting, only clashing if the treasure presented itself.</p><p>Yong'an Pavilion was the most crucial of all the halls within the stone tablet space.</p><p>Tianpeng the Great calmly said, "Perhaps our arrangements in Yong'an Pavilion bought us some time.  Yong'an Pavilion is incredibly grand, the most magnificent building I've ever seen, like a celestial palace. Far more alluring than this place; they're sure to go there first. But since Yin Changsheng is already coming, we can't be complacent.  The Xuantian Palace has controlled the Sacred Grounds for years—who knows what resources they possess? They might have a way to influence this place!  Fellow Daoist, if any treasures you looted from Yong'an Hall are relevant to this place, you should bring them out.  Any later, and we'll be wasting our efforts."</p><p>Hunmo the Elder smiled without speaking, his expression unchanged.</p><p>Unable to gauge the old demon's intentions, Tianpeng the Great inwardly scoffed, looking down at the chains. "After attacking for so long, the seal's power is much weaker. It's time to pull out the chains. I have a technique that can add considerable force.  You must have something similar, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>"Force it open?"</p><p>Hunmo the Elder frowned, turning towards the valley entrance.</p><p>Clouds and mist obscured the view, making it impossible to see the entrance.  It was clear, however, that the Xuantian Palace forces were rapidly approaching.</p><p>Tianpeng the Great's words weren't unreasonable.</p><p>Even if the demons and monsters joined forces, they could put up a fight.  But each one is cunning and prioritizes self-preservation.  The Xuantian Palace not only has Yin Changsheng and powerful artifacts, but they're also united, unlike our disparate group with conflicting interests.  If confronted, we'd be at a serious disadvantage.</p><p>"Very well," Hunmo the Elder nodded slightly. "I suspect that what's chained here isn't a single artifact or treasure, as we assumed, but something much larger. If it's a treasure vault or something similar, there should be enough for everyone."</p><p>Tianpeng the Great chuckled, neither confirming nor denying, before leaping back across, summoning the other demon kings to discuss the matter.</p><p>The other demons and monsters likewise feared the Xuantian Palace.  Once Yin Changsheng arrived, their chances of obtaining treasure would be even slimmer.</p><p>Quickly reaching a consensus, the demons and monsters unleashed their most powerful techniques, relentlessly attacking the seal.</p><p>The flames in the center of the platform surged, the seal becoming increasingly chaotic.</p><p>Tianpeng the Great fixed his gaze on the chains, seizing the moment. A golden light erupted from his body as he transformed into a golden-winged roc, his massive wings like clouds obscuring the sky, majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Running late, posting one chapter today.
