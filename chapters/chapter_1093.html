<h1>Chapter 1885: Soul Slave</h1><p>The ancient demon's fragmented soul is not to be underestimated.</p><p>After Nan Gui Xianzi moved the Demon Suppressing Stele, the Demon Lord was immediately in grave danger.  Even with the timely assistance of the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle, the Demon Lord was still on the defensive against the ancient demon's fragmented soul.</p><p>The situation on the other side was even more perilous.</p><p>Four Grand Cultivators were besieging Mo Qingzhu, but the situation was only slightly better than before; they were merely avoiding being defeated individually.  Mo Qingzhu's demonic power surged, overwhelming them. They could only retreat step by step, and in an instant, defeat was imminent.</p><p>Just at this critical moment, a scene that filled everyone with joy appeared.</p><p>Qingzhu, with unwavering resolve, did not give up hope in the face of such terrifying opponents.</p><p>He hid within a fragment of the spirit sword, and the demonic soul was momentarily unable to harm him.</p><p>This body originally belonged to Qingzhu.</p><p>Even with a significant difference in strength, as Qingzhu struggled, he could still affect the demonic soul's movements.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu's aura fluctuated, albeit slightly, almost imperceptibly, but at this moment, it became a crucial weakness, which Lingzhuzi and the others exploited.</p><p>The situation improved slightly.</p><p>The elder's expression was solemn.  He knew the situation was critical and worked tirelessly to refine the Sky Phoenix Feather.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang held a lotus seed in one hand and the ghost seal given to him by Su Nu in the other, cowering back.</p><p>Before the battle, the elder had created a protective barrier for the young man and woman to shield them from the aftershocks. Qin Sang, having moved closer, also benefited from it.</p><p>However, with the battle so intense, it remained uncertain whether this barrier could withstand the aftershocks.</p><p>The young man and woman were visibly tense, worried about their ancestors' situation.  Noticing Qin Sang's movements, they glanced at him without paying him much attention.</p><p>They were also curious about how he appeared there, but clearly, this wasn't the time to delve into that.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed himself against the edge of the space, opening his left hand to reveal the ghost seal.</p><p>Seeing that the body occupied by the ancient demon's fragmented soul was indeed Su Nu's, Qin Sang recalled the ghost seal Su Nu had given him.</p><p>Su Nu suspected the Dongji Alliance had ill intentions towards her, fearing she would be used as a vessel and possessed, so she gave the ghost seal to Qin Sang. However, Su Nu certainly couldn't have imagined that the one plotting against her body was such a terrifying ancient demon.</p><p>Would this insignificant ghost seal even work?</p><p>With a "dead horse, doctor" mentality, Qin Sang activated the ghost seal using the method Su Nu had taught him.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the situation changed too rapidly.</p><p>Before the secret technique was complete, in the blink of an eye, the Sky Phoenix Feather changed hands, and the battle erupted.</p><p>Both battlefields were in critical danger.</p><p>Qin Sang's lips moved slightly. As the secret technique neared completion, a surprising scene unfolded: a wisp of black energy suddenly emerged from the ghost seal, transforming into a humanoid figure, bearing a striking resemblance to Su Nu!</p><p>'Su Nu' was contorted in pain, her expression twisted, emitting a silent wail.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. Before he could examine it carefully, he suddenly felt a tightening in his body, as if locked in by a gaze.  He looked up in alarm and found the Demon Lord staring at him.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang activated the ghost seal, a faint layer of ghost markings suddenly appeared on the face of the ancient demon's fragmented soul, emitting an unusual aura that didn't belong to it.</p><p>Compared to the ancient demon's fragmented soul's aura, the ghost markings' aura was extremely weak, not even comparable.</p><p>But upon seeing the ghost markings, the Demon Lord's eyes lit up, instantly locking onto their source—the ghost seal in Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>"Give it to me!"</p><p>The Demon Lord's roar echoed in Qin Sang's ears. His body stiffened, then he felt his hand lighten as the Demon Lord snatched the ghost seal.</p><p>"Hmm? A soul seed or a slave mark? Interesting!"</p><p>The Demon Lord seemed to have found a treasure, laughing aloud.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A brilliant yellow light erupted from the Demon Lord's palm, wildly pouring the Great Yin Heaven Ghost divine light into the ghost seal.</p><p>At that moment, the ancient demon's fragmented soul glanced down at its arm, intending to shatter the ghost markings.</p><p>With the Demon Lord's action, the seemingly fragile ghost markings suddenly surged with ghostly energy, resisting the ancient demon's fragmented soul's power.  They instantly covered half of the face and rapidly spread across the body.</p><p>It was Su Nu's face.</p><p>One half was enveloped by ghost markings, sinister and eerie.</p><p>The other half flaunted demonic flames, bloodthirsty and frenzied.</p><p>"If it's indeed a soul seed or a slave mark as the Demon Lord said, did Su Nu, to counter the soul trying to possess her body, actively refine herself into a soul slave?"</p><p>Then, she could combine her own power with her master's to fight back and swallow the other?"  Qin Sang vaguely guessed Su Nu's plan, and was shocked by this woman.</p><p>To counter the body-snatching ordeal, she refined herself into a soul slave, voluntarily surrendering the Ghost Seal to find a master—such an idea was incredibly insane.  Qin Sang was the master she chose.</p><p>Even if successful, she would become another's slave.  Of course, the difference from being possessed was that she would still be alive. In the cultivation world, as long as one is alive, there is hope!</p><p>If the opponent were not such a terrifying ancient demon, but only a wisp of a remnant soul, Su Nu might have succeeded.</p><p>"I wonder if the ancient demon hasn't completely devoured Su Nu? Or perhaps Su Nu's soul is hidden within the Ghost Mark, and the ancient demon's fragmented soul, after consecutive battles following its unsealing, hasn't had time to check its host body? Who could have imagined that someone so weak, someone the ancient demon could completely ignore, could outsmart it...?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to herself, feeling incredibly lucky.  Su Nu's plan had played a crucial role.  She sighed, "If I survive this, I really need to thank her properly."</p><p>She just didn't know if Su Nu was still alive.</p><p>This bizarre turn of events not only shocked Qin Sang, but the ancient demon's fragmented soul was completely unprepared. It was instantly enraged and furious.</p><p>The Demon Lord, having cultivated the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light, was extremely adept at manipulating Yin ghosts. With the Ghost Seal in his hands, it was much harder for the ancient demon's fragmented soul to shatter the Ghost Mark.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Ghost Seal enveloped by the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light. Its form had drastically changed, surrounded by countless Yin spirits—completely different from before.</p><p>The fluctuations within the Ghost Mark were also growing stronger.</p><p>The ancient demon's fragmented soul suppressed it with all its might, managing only to compress the Ghost Mark onto its cheek.  Even reduced to a tiny black dot, it couldn't be completely erased.</p><p>Unexpected events unfolded on both battlefields. Both individuals were being possessed, and both were using their own methods to resist.</p><p>With the Ghost Mark in the Demon Lord's possession, he naturally wouldn't miss this hard-won opportunity.  Using the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light, he analyzed and improved the Ghost Seal.</p><p>The ancient demon's fragmented soul, enraged, glared at the Ghost Seal in the Demon Lord's hands and charged furiously.</p><p>The Demon Lord and the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle exchanged a glance. Using the turtle shell, they desperately protected the Ghost Seal and engaged the ancient demon's fragmented soul.</p><p>The previously dire situation was barely stabilized.  However, this precarious balance couldn't last long.</p><p>At this moment, the elder finally used his secret technique to refine the Sky Phoenix Feather.</p><p>Silently glancing at the two battlefields, he didn't hesitate. He swung his hand towards the crimson crystal wall.</p><p>The Sky Phoenix Feather ignited without fire.</p><p>The flames were weak this time, far less spectacular than when the Jiao Dragon King used the Phoenix Clan's secret technique.</p><p>But it was enough!</p><p>The crimson crystal wall was scorched by the Phoenix flames, showing signs of melting.</p><p>The Sky Phoenix Feather, seemingly real and illusory, tore a crack in the crimson crystal wall. The Phoenix flames enveloped the elder as he took a step forward!</p>
