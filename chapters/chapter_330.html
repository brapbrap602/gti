Chapter 323: Soulheart Fruit


After the warning, Gao Yi wasted no time and declared the auction open.
A graceful young woman emerged from the darkness, carrying a square tray covered with a red cloth.
Intimidated by Gao Yi, the crowd refrained from using their divine senses to peek, patiently awaiting his announcement.
With a flourish, Gao Yi lifted the red cloth.
“The first item of this auction: a high-grade magical artifact, the Bloodflame Fork!”
As the cloth was removed, a fork-shaped artifact came into view.  Crimson all over, its two prongs were incredibly sharp. Though only the size of an adult's palm, everyone knew this wasn't its true form.
Once activated, it would certainly be much larger.
Qin Sang understood the auction's rhythm. The quality of the treasures would gradually increase, culminating in the final, most coveted item.
By then, the crowd's excitement would reach fever pitch.
The first item was merely a high-grade magical artifact, but no one seemed disappointed.  For Foundation Establishment cultivators, especially rogue cultivators, acquiring Talismans was a luxury. Most could only afford one or two top-grade magical artifacts, relying on high-grade ones for everyday use.
This was true even for Yu Daiyue and his two companions, who had besieged Qin Sang.
The young man in warrior attire possessed two top-grade magical artifacts: a Seven-Colored Umbrella and a flying sword.  However, they were of the lowest quality among top-grade artifacts, worth at most 1,500 low-grade spirit stones each. Combined, they were still less valuable than the scarred man's flying sword.
The scarred man, having recently broken through to mid-Foundation Establishment, had spent heavily on resources for his advancement. He only had his flying sword and a Thunderclap Talisman as his trump card left.
He had thought eliminating Qin Sang, a Shaohua Mountain disciple, would bring him great wealth, but he ended up losing his life instead.
Although Yu Daiyue also struggled for his breakthrough, as a sect disciple, he was wealthier than the scarred man. His flying sword and octagonal bronze mirror were both mid-to-high quality top-grade magical artifacts, each worth over 2,000 low-grade spirit stones.
Of course, these were just estimates. The actual transaction price could fluctuate greatly depending on the artifact's specific function and the needs of the buyer and seller.
For instance, the scarred man's flying sword was undoubtedly a rare spirit sword, a highly prized weapon.  If he had found the right buyer, he could have potentially sold it for 5,000 low-grade spirit stones.
Qin Sang mentally assessed his own assets, listening attentively as Gao Yi continued.
“The Bloodflame Fork, once activated, creates a flurry of illusory fire forks, concealing the true weapon within.  Of course, if that were all, it wouldn't be here. Its true power lies in the sealed Venomfire. Should an opponent's spiritual energy come into contact with it, the Venomfire will spread through their body like a clinging curse…”
Qin Sang thought, "As expected." High-grade magical artifacts offered at auction were never ordinary.  With the sealed Venomfire, the Bloodflame Fork was no less valuable than the warrior's flying sword.
Gao Yi demonstrated the Bloodflame Fork's abilities, then let the illusory forks dissipate and placed the artifact back on the tray. “The owner has set the starting price at 500 low-grade spirit stones or a magical artifact with concealment properties.”
Trading the Bloodflame Fork for a concealment artifact showed that its owner prioritized self-preservation. However, concealment artifacts were even more precious, and Qin Sang doubted he would get one.
As soon as Gao Yi finished speaking, bids began.
“550 low-grade spirit stones…”
“580…”
Unexpectedly, the price quickly climbed to 1,300 low-grade spirit stones before the momentum slowed.
Qin Sang's prediction was correct; everyone opted for spirit stones, no one offered an artifact in exchange.
“1,700 low-grade spirit stones!”
After a few more bids, only a handful of people remained. A cultivator in brocade robes suddenly raised the bid by 200 spirit stones, then bowed slightly, saying with a smile, “I've been looking for a weapon like this.  This is my final offer. If anyone bids higher, I'll withdraw.”
This price far exceeded Gao Yi's expectations.
A high price for the first item was an auspicious start.  A hint of excitement entered Gao Yi's voice.  “This gentleman offers 1,700 low-grade spirit stones.  Are there any other bids, or perhaps a concealment artifact of comparable value?”
No one responded.
Gao Yi waited a moment longer, then declared the Bloodflame Fork sold to the cultivator in brocade.
As the auction progressed, the atmosphere grew tense.  Some items sparked fierce competition, driving prices higher and higher.
With a clear goal in mind, Qin Sang remained calm. Although he bid on a couple of promising artifacts, he ultimately decided to pass after careful consideration.

“Soulheart Fruit!”
Gao Yi’s voice now carried a note of passion and enticement.  He unveiled the red cloth, revealing a purple fruit on the tray.
The fruit resembled a plum, with incredibly thin skin through which flowing juice was visible.  A restrictive seal on its surface preserved its potency.
Seeing the Soulheart Fruit, Qin Sang's eyes flickered.
He'd heard of the Soulheart Fruit from Yun Youzi. It could nourish a cultivator's Nascent Soul.
It also aided in recovery from soul injuries. Yun Youzi himself had consumed one, but to no effect.
Protected by the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang didn't need it and leaned back to observe.
At that moment, he noticed the large man in the corner suddenly sit up, gripping his thighs, his gaze fixated on the Soulheart Fruit.
Even with the mask, Qin Sang could sense his excitement.
Until now, the large man hadn't spoken.  This sudden eagerness was his first reaction.
Could he have a soul injury?
Qin Sang scrutinized him, but it didn't seem likely.
“Soulheart Fruit, starting price 1,000 low-grade spirit stones, or a flying sword-type magical artifact.”
As soon as Gao Yi finished, the large man blurted out anxiously, “Can it only be exchanged for flying swords or spirit stones? Can I use other spiritual herbs?”
Gao Yi frowned slightly, replying firmly, “The owner only wants spirit stones or flying swords.  If you lack a flying sword but desire the Soulheart Fruit, you may present your spiritual herbs and barter with others here…”
This was a pre-established rule of the auction.  Gao Yi would act as a witness for transactions between attendees, taking a cut as payment.
A figure in black robes immediately spoke up, “What kind of spiritual herbs do you have, fellow Daoist? If they're valuable enough, I can bid on the Soulheart Fruit for you and then trade.”
Qin Sang's interest was piqued, and he also sent a mental message to the large man.
He had three spirit swords.  If the man’s herbs were valuable enough, he might bid on the Soulheart Fruit.
Sensing the large man's desperation, many others sent him messages, hoping for a bargain.
