<h1>Chapter 624: The Canglang Sea (Extra chapter for the alliance leader Qianyu!)</h1><p>The western frontier is too barren, the spiritual energy is thin, unsuitable for long-term cultivation. Even local Foundation Establishment cultivators leave for other places.  Qin Sang doesn't want to be stuck here; it will affect her future cultivation. Beyond the western frontier, the world is vast.</p><p>If she can't find the ancient teleportation array, she'll have to leave temporarily to find a suitable cultivation location, improve her cultivation, and then return.</p><p>Lately, Qin Sang has been wondering if Senior Qingzhu had a similar experience. During the teleportation, she was almost torn apart by the ancient array, surviving only because of a severed arm and depleted spiritual sense.  If her spiritual power hadn't been sealed by the prohibition, the outcome would have been better.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu was at least a late Foundation Establishment cultivator; he shouldn't have died during teleportation.  Yet, with his great revenge unfulfilled, he hasn't returned to Xiaohan Domain.</p><p>Did something happen?  Or did Senior Qingzhu also fail to find the ancient teleportation array?</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><p>"Has a cultivator named Qingzhu ever appeared in the western frontier?" Qin Sang suddenly asked.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi thought for a moment and shook his head: "Although the western frontier is barren and mostly wild, there are still prominent figures. I've never heard of anyone named Qingzhu."</p><p>Qin Sang said: "Think carefully. Qingzhu is just his given name; he might have aliases like 'Sword Demon'. He's devoted to the sword, skilled in swordsmanship, at least a late Foundation Establishment cultivator, possibly even a Nascent Soul cultivator.  Consider the past two hundred years, has there been anyone similar?"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi smiled, "Senior, if such a person existed in the western frontier, he would be renowned!  Most cultivators born and raised here leave after reaching Foundation Establishment. Why would such a powerful cultivator come here? Even those hunting insects wouldn't stay long. If you're looking for someone, I can investigate while gathering information; maybe I'll find something."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi is curious about Qin Sang's purpose.  Is the person she's looking for, like his uncle-master, a senior from their sect who disappeared after leaving? He's guessed right – her sect has a Nascent Soul cultivator, quite a remarkable background.</p><p>"Very well," Qin Sang nodded. "Besides that, spread the word, offering a large reward for Soul-Guiding Grass and Everlasting Camphor.  Also, keep an eye out for locations where Fire-Sparrows appear."</p><p>Everlasting Camphor is usually buried deep underground, difficult to find. If they find the companion beast, the Fire-Sparrow, they can find the Everlasting Camphor.</p><p>Qin Sang only needs the Everlasting Camphor to complete the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring. This artifact will greatly increase her strength; it’s her quickest path to improvement. Furthermore, the ring's unique effects will be useful when searching for the ancient teleportation array in the wilderness.</p><p>Soul-Guiding Grass is also needed – to refine more Sky-Flying Night Rakshasas; she will be unstoppable in the early Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>"Fire-Sparrows, Everlasting Camphor, Soul-Guiding Grass…" Cui Xuanzi's face fell. He thought Qin Sang's requests were excessive, treating their Five Elements Sect like pack animals, though these were only information-gathering tasks, not life-threatening ones.</p><p>"I've never heard of any of these. Please tell me more, Senior."</p><p>These three were quite rare; it's normal that Cui Xuanzi hadn't seen them. Qin Sang took out a jade slip and engraved images of them on it.</p><p>"Do your job well, and I won't treat you poorly."  Qin Sang showed Cui Xuanzi two top-grade artifacts and several bottles of spirit pills before putting them away and handing over the jade slip.</p><p>…</p><p>The Black-Winged Eagle's cave.</p><p>Qin Sang has set up an array, using it as a temporary residence. It will suffice for now, but she'll need to find a better place eventually.  However, the spiritual energy in the western frontier is thin, making it hard to find a satisfactory cave.</p><p>Qin Sang sat on a meditation cushion, holding three jade slips, examining them one by one.</p><p>The three jade slips contained the Five Insects Sect's true teachings on insect control, a geomantic map, and the Witch Insect List, which noted the habitats of some spirit insects. This information was accumulated by the Five Insects Sect over the years.</p><p>Qin Sang has sent Cui Xuanzi back to gather more information.  She urgently wants to know where she is and started with the geomantic map.</p><p>The Five Insects Sect's map is most detailed about the Xiong Mountain region and its surroundings. It also briefly introduces the major powers in the western frontier, but information beyond it is extremely sparse.  Beyond the Witch God Continent, it's completely blank.</p><p>According to the map, the Witch God Continent is roughly divided into three regions: the western frontier, the southern frontier, and Witch God Mountain.  The western and southern frontiers are both called "barren lands." The western frontier is the most barren; even powerful cultivators avoid it. The southern frontier is better, with more and stronger forces, but also more chaotic, constantly at war.</p><p>The harsh, treacherous mountains and waters of Western Xinjiang offer few habitable places for the Wu people.  Settlements are clustered in areas like Xiong Mountain, where both ordinary people and cultivators live together in relative safety.</p><p>These regions are separated by vast, untamed wilderness, some extremely distant from each other.  The wilderness is fraught with countless dangers; ordinary people are certain to die venturing in, and even Foundation Establishment cultivators must remain constantly vigilant.</p><p>Looking at this map, Qin Sang finally grasped the sheer size of the Wu God Continent, marveling at the expanse of the sea.</p><p>The sea surrounding the Wu God Continent was once called the Wu God Sea by the Wu people, but after the rise of the human race, it was renamed the Canglang Sea, a change that deeply angered the Wu people, though they could do nothing about it.</p><p>Western Xinjiang alone is almost as large as Little Cold Territory.  Excluding the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, Little Cold Territory is long and narrow, running east to west.  Western Xinjiang, on the western side of the Wu God Continent, is roughly semicircular.  Southern Xinjiang is similar in shape to Little Cold Territory, but even larger than Western Xinjiang.</p><p>Wu God Mountain, the ancestral home of the Wu people and considered a sacred site, represents the most fertile region of the Wu God Continent.  Compared to Wu God Mountain, Western and Southern Xinjiang are considered remote areas. The most powerful Wu factions reside there.</p><p>Legend speaks of a Wu cultivator at the late Yuan Ying stage, but the Five Insects Sect lacks knowledge of which faction this powerful cultivator belongs to.</p><p>The Wu God Continent is just one island in the vast Canglang Sea, albeit the largest. The Wu people control the Wu God Continent and a surrounding area of the sea, located in the southeastern corner of the Canglang Sea.</p><p>The Stormy Demon Sea is not part of the Canglang Sea.</p><p>The Canglang Sea is not boundless; its edges are surrounded by terrifying storms, contained by a strange barrier formed by ancient restrictions.  Even Yuan Ying cultivators dare not enter the most violent parts of the storm.</p><p>To this day, no one knows how this barrier was created or by whom.  Despite the constant battering of the storms, it remains remarkably stable.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.  He suddenly remembered the spiritual tides of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and the mysterious barrier between the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and Little Cold Territory.</p><p>The similarities are striking.  Could there be a connection between them?</p>
