<h1>Chapter 1236: The Nascent Soul Puppet</h1><p>Gong Liangyu stood before the cave entrance, looking around.  He then flicked his fingers, sending out more than a dozen blue lights.  Each light contained a tiny jade talisman, no bigger than a chess piece.  Exceedingly intricate, they fell around the cave mouth like scattered flowers.  All the talismans were interconnected, forming a complex warning array; some hidden in mid-air, others concealed within the rocks and earth, completely invisible.</p><p>After setting the talismans, Gong Liangyu darted into the cave.  Shortly after, Dongyang Bo arrived at the spot where Gong Liangyu had stood.  A white light shimmered as the Vajra pestle subtly vibrated, silently emitting minute waves that precisely located each talisman, effortlessly masking their perception.  Dongyang Bo slipped through the array unnoticed.  Once the Vajra pestle’s vibrations ceased, the talismans returned to normal, completely unaware of the deception.</p><p>A third person then appeared. Qin Sang had witnessed Gong Liangyu’s every move. He recognized the technique; he’d seen something similar at the ancient cultivator's ruins.  Elder Dique had used a similar method to threaten Qin Sang into scouting ahead for Xuan Yu Daozhang, who had left similar warning talismans along his path. However, Gong Liangyu’s skill was clearly far superior to Xuan Yu Daozhang's.  The interconnected talismans formed an extremely intricate array. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator could easily trigger them unintentionally and be detected by Gong Liangyu.</p><p>Assisted by the Heaven's Eye butterfly, Qin Sang could see through the array's intricacies, but not as effortlessly as Dongyang Bo. It seemed Dongyang Bo had long anticipated this, thoroughly familiar with Gong Liangyu’s methods.  Secretly activating his Heaven's Eye ability, Qin Sang fully understood the array.  His demeanor suddenly changed; he became like a sharp sword, its momentum pressing against the array. A faint sword light burst forth, a single strike cutting through the void, vanishing instantly as if it had never existed.  Qin Sang had vanished into the cave with the sword light.</p><p>The three entered successively, leaving only the talisman array guarding the entrance.  Entering the cave, they discovered an incredibly vast space.  The hill was hollow beneath, apparently once the course of a large river; a massive riverbed, hundreds of miles wide, stretched endlessly into the depths, its bottom unseen.</p><p>Gong Liangyu hovered above a river of blood, his expression grave.  The underground river was gone, but a thick blood mist filled the space, like a surging river of blood flowing down the ancient riverbed. The malevolent energy here was overwhelmingly strong.  However, Gong Liangyu's greatest concern wasn't the malevolent energy.  According to the information he'd received, the Blood Ginseng grew at the bottom of this river; entering the river was the only way to find it.  The blood river was treacherous, far from calm; Gong Liangyu, despite his cultivation, sensed many dangers within. The river bottom was surely even more perilous.  With his current cultivation, retrieving the treasure from such a place was impossible.</p><p>Gong Liangyu's expression shifted, as if making a difficult decision.  Finally, he steeled himself, raising the hand holding the jade pendant, holding it before him.  A Nascent Soul phantom appeared on his forehead, sending a strand of divine sense towards the pendant.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The jade pendant shattered, instantly reduced to dust.  In its place remained a ball of azure light.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>He enveloped the azure light with his divine sense and absorbed it into his Nascent Soul.  His eyes immediately became exceptionally clear.  This light calmed his soul, and Gong Liangyu felt his mind unprecedentedly steady, free of distracting thoughts.  Azure light flickered in his Purple Mansion as the azure light protected his Nascent Soul.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Gong Liangyu raised his other hand.  Looking at the small figure in his hand, understanding there was no turning back, he hesitated no more.  He formed a hand seal, releasing the yellow talisman on the figure's forehead.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Instantly, the small figure blazed with light.  Within the light, countless illusory talisman phantoms flickered repeatedly.  Behind these phantoms, faint figures appeared, some pained, some frenzied, some laughing wildly, some screaming—a chaotic dance of demons.  A hint of fear flickered across Gong Liangyu’s face.</p><p>‘Hum! Hum!’</p><p>The small figure came alive, struggling violently with immense strength.  Gong Liangyu sensed the figure was about to break free from his control, his expression changing. Without hesitation, he spat out a mouthful of refined blood and, using a secret technique passed down through his lineage, performed a series of hand seals, sending them into the small figure.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A small statue, about the size of a hand, suddenly grew to human height, appearing before Gong Liangyu.  Its faceless visage was directly in front of him.</p><p>Then, its face began to writhe and contort in a sickening display.  In the blink of an eye, features formed.  Strangely, the face was an exact replica of Gong Liangyu's own, like a twin brother.  He felt a profound unease, as if looking into a mirror, a deep worry settling in his heart.</p><p>The figure suddenly opened its eyes, the pupils black as ink, filled with madness yet strangely accompanied by a sinister smile.  Gong Liangyu felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>Simultaneously, a terrifying aura erupted from the figure, instantly surpassing Gong Liangyu's own power, rivaling that of a Yuan Ying cultivator!</p><p>This was the Yuan Ying Talisman Puppet, one of the four sacred talismans of the Shangyuan Quiet Palace.</p><p>Of the four—the Heavenly Gang Blade Talisman, the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman, and the Inner Scene Yuan Talisman—were all normal talismans.  Only the Yuan Ying Talisman Puppet was a unique entity, akin to a puppet. It was unintentionally created by a Shangyuan Quiet Palace ancestor, a fusion of talismanic weaponry techniques, puppetry arts, and demonic soul refinement techniques.</p><p>After the ancestor's death, the Yuan Ying Talisman Puppet was left behind as a treasured guardian of the sect.  It had protected the Shangyuan Quiet Palace through countless calamities, allowing it to survive periods of decline and maintain its position among the top sects.</p><p>Legend held that the Yuan Ying Talisman Puppet could not be removed from the Shangyuan Quiet Palace.  It was only used in times of dire need, when the sect was under attack and facing imminent danger.  Combined with the mountain protection array, the Yuan Ying-level puppet made the sect's defenses impregnable.  Outside the mountain, no one had ever witnessed a Shangyuan Quiet Palace cultivator using the puppet in battle.</p><p>Gong Liangyu's bringing the Yuan Ying Talisman Puppet out was a clear deviation from this tradition.  The legend was likely a misconception, perhaps a deliberate fabrication by the Palace, or there were other reasons.</p><p>Gong Liangyu's summoning of the puppet was clearly to aid him in his quest for treasure in the Blood River. Yet, his expression was far from normal, revealing a deep fear of the puppet.</p><p>The ancestor's creation was inherently flawed.  Over countless years, the puppet had become even more sinister, and most of its other functions had deteriorated.  Each time the Shangyuan Quiet Palace used it, they paid a heavy price.  It was a pyrrhic victory; a devastating cost for any advantage gained.</p>
