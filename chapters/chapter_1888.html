<h1>Chapter 1879: Riding the Dragon, Reaching the Moon</h1><p>Their attempt at the Illusionary Storm proved fruitless.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that his current strength had nearly reached its limit in exploring to the location of the Red Gold Spirit Needle; further investigation would be very difficult.</p><p>Before repairing the Taiyi Star Chart, there was no need to waste more time.</p><p>The three retreated, and Qin Sang chose a different route, stopping at the edge of the blue luminous sea.</p><p>“Having traveled so far, I ask for your help, Daoist friend, in finding a treasure,” Qin Sang pointed to the sea, informing Mo Xingdao of the possibility of finding a Vajra Bodhi tree and its fruit there.</p><p>The luminous sea was vast, too much for one person to manage alone. If they found the Vajra Bodhi tree, Qin Sang didn't mind sharing.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's expression changed slightly, and he repeatedly asked, “Is there truly a Vajra fruit, one of the ten divine trees, in this place?”</p><p>Seeing Mo Xingdao's expression, Qin Sang had a thought, “Could this treasure help you, Daoist friend?”</p><p>After Mo Xingdao's explanation, Qin Sang learned that the Vajra fruit could be refined into his puppet body, supposedly providing significant benefits. Unfortunately, two Vajra fruits had already been devoured by the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>Hope was rekindled in Mo Xingdao; his previous gloom vanished, and he eagerly prepared to enter the luminous sea.</p><p>Qin Sang also released the Luo Hou spirit and told them the characteristics of the Vajra Bodhi tree's aura.  They split into four directions to search carefully.</p><p>Due to insufficient preparation and excessive energy expenditure during the Illusionary Storm, the group withdrew after a month, finding nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly searched the area where the previous secluded valley had been located over ten times, without finding the slightest trace.</p><p>Logically, the shockwaves from the Illusionary Storm were no less powerful than the Guifang Nation's Primordial Formation, yet the blue luminous sea showed no unusual changes like before.</p><p>To understand the reason, they would have to determine what was special about the Guifang Nation's Primordial Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Mo Xingdao discussed it, and weren't discouraged. Exploring the Illusionary Storm wouldn't be accomplished overnight; they would return frequently in the future, and there would be opportunities.</p><p>“Please wait here a moment, Daoist friend. I recall something I need to do; I'll be right back,” Qin Sang left Mo Xingdao and flew towards his cave abode.</p><p>Years ago, Qin Sang had brought Mo Xingdao back to the flower field and had kept him confined to the cave abode. Mo Xingdao still didn't know about the existence of the flower spirits.</p><p>Everything in the flower field was as usual.</p><p>Qin Sang landed in a flower bed and carefully checked the condition of the flower spirits, walking through flower bed after flower bed.  Finally, he picked up a jade bottle, sighing softly.</p><p>The collected flower dew was scarce, far less than during its peak.</p><p>Over the years, the flower spirits had gradually recovered, but the pace was slow. The flower spirits that had been uprooted had only regained a faint trace of life.</p><p>It was foreseeable that in the future, the flower dew wouldn't be enough to sustain his cultivation needs.</p><p>“In the future, I may be able to barely manage by balancing cultivation, comprehending the Dharma image, and refining the five elements...”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, inspected the flower field array, and returned the way he came, leaving the spiritual grounds with Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Reaching the Star Island Immortal Lake, they parted ways. Qin Sang returned to his cave abode on Sword Heart Island, rested, and then took out the Taiyi Star Chart.</p><p>Moonlight filled the room.</p><p>The light was like water, clear and intoxicating, flowing through Qin Sang's fingers and across the quiet room.</p><p>Since arriving in this realm, Qin Sang hadn't touched this treasure; it remained as it was when he first saw it.</p><p>The Taiyi Star Chart resembled a divine palanquin, or a divine palace, carved from mutton-fat jade. Sadly, it was covered in cracks, a distressing sight.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Taiyi Star Chart, eyes closed slightly, his mind enveloping it, sensing the treasure.</p><p>After a long while, he raised his other hand, drawing talismans in the air, sending streaks of divine symbols towards the Taiyi Star Chart.</p><p>The talismans floated around the Taiyi Star Chart, like an eight-sided screen. Faint blood energy flowed between the eight talismans, forming a strange blood ring—a kind of talisman formation from the Chongxuan Sect, used to help cultivators analyze the origin of unknown treasures.</p><p>The Taiyi Star Chart had been with Qin Sang for many years. Occasionally, he would take it out to examine and study it.</p><p>However, his cultivation and skills in refining artifacts had far surpassed what they once were.  Now, upon closer examination, he made many new discoveries.</p><p>Gradually, the light in the cave fluctuated, and the Taiyi Star Chart emitted a series of clinking sounds, like the collision of bells and jades.</p><p>Qin Sang remained seated, motionless, but his hand seals had changed several times.</p><p>At this moment, the Taiyi Star Chart floated by itself in front of him.</p><p>Qin Sang sometimes drew talismans, sometimes fell into thought, his left hand unconsciously gesturing.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, murmuring in surprise, “I never imagined that the Four Saints of the Canglang Sea had such high attainments in artifact refinement!”</p><p>From Qin Sang's current perspective, repairing the Taiyi Star Chart was no less difficult than repairing the war drum. In its perfect state, it was possibly a genuine treasure or a postnatal spiritual treasure.</p><p>Without relying on Master Gu and Master Yuan's insights, the analysis alone would take a considerable amount of time.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang discovered that Bao Gu's repair method was actually feasible.</p><p>Of course, it was impossible to completely restore the Taiyi Star Chart; it was more like Master Gu's first restoration of the war drum, only recovering some of its power.</p><p>This was a remarkable achievement.  Remember, Bao Gu, the most powerful among the Four Saints, had only recently reached the Divine Transformation stage, unless they had received alchemic inheritance at the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>From Qin Sang's current perspective, Bao Gu's approach inevitably had limitations, with errors and omissions.  However, Qin Sang could continue along Bao Gu's line of thinking, saving a lot of effort.</p><p>As with the restoration of the war drum, the first step was preliminary repair.  Even if the repaired power wasn't satisfactory, it would help analyze the Taiyi Star Chart, and then strive for perfection later.</p><p>This way, Qin Sang could complete it independently, without needing to ask others for help.</p><p>Thinking this through, Qin Sang almost immediately made a decision. Setting aside his own cultivation, he sent a message to Jian Nu and then closed his cave dwelling to enter seclusion again.</p><p>The progress was smoother than expected.</p><p>Qin Sang essentially perfected Bao Gu's approach, making it far easier than starting from scratch.</p><p>Many ideas Bao Gu couldn't achieve, Qin Sang could, and could further develop and expand upon.</p><p>Due to limited perspective, Bao Gu chose spiritual items of lower grades, creating risks in refining. Qin Sang replaced them with higher-grade spiritual materials with similar properties and higher purity, increasing the chance of success.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang would also make changes based on his own understanding and the actual situation.</p><p>In just two years, Qin Sang had a clear idea. The next step was to gather the spiritual materials.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>After two years, Qin Sang opened the quiet room for the first time.</p><p>Sunlight filtered through the gaps in the leaves, falling on him, bringing a wave of warmth. Qin Sang extended his spiritual sense and noticed that the protective formation of the Sword Master's cave dwelling was activated.</p><p>Jian Nu, not in seclusion, sensed the spiritual sense fluctuations and flew over.</p><p>"Has the Sword Master returned to the island?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Jian Nu nodded. "The master returned half a year ago. Seeing that the master was cultivating, he didn't disturb them and instructed me that he would be in seclusion for a while."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Sword Master's cave dwelling. In recent years, the Sword Master had frequently gone out and would enter seclusion upon returning, making opportunities for them to meet rare. He wondered what they were busy with.</p><p>After asking a few questions and learning about the current situation from Jian Nu, Qin Sang flew towards Hu Zhong Island.</p><p>The atmosphere in Xingdao Xianhu remained tense as always. Qin Sang formally landed on the island and went to Qi's residence first.</p><p>Several days later, Qin Sang and Qi Master's disciples left Qi's residence separately, searching for materials.</p><p>Qin Sang's wealth was considerable; the preliminary repair of the Taiyi Star Chart wouldn't deplete his resources.</p><p>However, the spiritual items he chose were all treasures.  Even searching all of Xingdao Xianhu would be insufficient.</p><p>Over the next six months, Qin Sang actively contacted old friends like Youhuang Zhenren and frequently participated in auctions and trading events. When he encountered his targets, he wouldn't hesitate to overpay.</p><p>If he heard that someone might possess a certain spiritual material, he would try to persuade them to part with it.</p><p>During this time, many cultivators in Xingdao Xianhu heard rumors of a wealthy and mysterious expert.</p><p>Half a year later, Qi Master's disciples gathered the miscellaneous materials. Seeing that Xingdao Xianhu had been largely "stripped" by him, Qin Sang decided to travel west.</p><p>If one were to talk about the world's treasures, where were they most abundant?  The Dao Court, of course!</p><p>Returning to the Dao Court.</p><p>The golden armored guards already knew Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the Dao Court with a golden armored guard, chatting amicably.  Learning that Master Yuan was still in seclusion, he asked the guard to take him to the treasure vault.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that the government office managing the North Pole Exorcism Courtyard's treasure vault was surprisingly called the Grain and Provisions Office, befitting the Dao Court's military establishment.</p><p>Master Yuan had personally taken him to the treasure vault, explaining the properties of various spiritual materials. Through this, Qin Sang became acquainted with Du Lu Miao Zhenren, who managed the Grain and Provisions Office.</p><p>Miao Zhenren held the position of Du Lu in the Grain and Provisions Office, a rank four official, with cultivation comparable to Qin Sang's, and they were equals.</p><p>Learning of Qin Sang's arrival, Miao Zhenren warmly welcomed him, and Qin Sang stated his purpose directly.</p><p>Miao Zhenren didn't refuse, pondering, "Friend Daoist wishes to exchange with merit?"</p><p>Here, spirit stones were useless.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked, "I wonder if a barter exchange is possible, all rare treasures, I assure you it will not cause Daoist any trouble."</p><p>Then, Qin Sang took out several of Ling You Wang's relics.</p><p>Miao Zhenren quickly glanced over them, his expression relaxing.  Exchanges of high for low, or equal value, he could authorize. His main concern was if Qin Sang's request was too high and he couldn't provide equivalent items.</p><p>It's not that many low-grade spiritual materials could be exchanged for a high-grade one.</p><p>That day, Qin Sang left the altar with a light step, having exchanged most of the spiritual materials he needed.  The remaining items were recorded in the Daoist temple, and Master Miao had indicated their location.</p><p>Qin Sang was most grateful, but also felt a pang of regret for the treasures he had traded.</p><p>After paying a visit to Master Gu, Qin Sang used a small teleportation array, moving several times, until he reached the southernmost point of Baishi Prefecture, entering the Abyssal Sea to search for the spiritual materials on the islands.</p><p>Over the next six months, Qin Sang explored the islands Master Miao had mentioned. On his return, he personally visited Huangquan Dao to investigate the situation. While the outside world remained untouched by war, Huangquan Dao was already a river of blood, the site of countless brutal battles.</p><p>Qin Sang did not intend to reveal himself, so his understanding of the situation was limited.  However, there was no sign of a large-scale battle between the Daoist temple and the Gui Fang Kingdom; he still had time.</p><p>With the collected spiritual materials, Qin Sang rushed back to the Qi residence, immediately sealing the fire chamber and ordering no one to disturb him.</p><p>Inside the fire chamber, the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and the Earth Vein Flame Fire shone brightly.</p><p>Qin Sang used his spiritual sense to refine the spiritual materials one by one, then threw the Taiyi Star Chariot into the fire and used his spells to activate its energy pathways. The process was similar to repairing the war drum.</p><p>Compared to then, Qin Sang was more at ease. He had improved, and this repair required less effort.</p><p>As the essence of the spiritual materials poured into the spiritual fire, the Taiyi Star Chariot did not transform into a spirit embryo.  Qin Sang was more like a repairman, mending cracks.</p><p>However, the Taiyi Star Chariot underwent noticeable changes.  Some of its powers were activated, and its form altered, as if gradually unfolding.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A blinding light erupted from the fire chamber.  Qin Sang's eyes widened. Without hesitation, his palms surged with blood energy, pouring into the spiritual fire. The Taiyi Star Chariot was enveloped in a cocoon of interwoven flame and blood energy.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A pure, radiant light broke free from the cocoon.</p><p>Fatigue etched on his face, Qin Sang’s joy was undeniable.  He stabilized the earth fire vein and gazed at the shimmering white light before him.</p><p>Within the light was an object—undeniably a jade chariot.  The chariot was exquisitely crafted, with a jade seat inside, an open front, half-height side panels, and a rear jade panel with intricate openwork carvings depicting mystical symbols.  It had a canopy with hanging tassels, truly elegant.</p><p>Some details seemed mismatched, a result of incomplete repair, Qin Sang knew.</p><p>After a long gaze, Qin Sang’s expression changed. He had intended to activate it but hesitated.  Having personally refined it, he had a certain understanding of the chariot.  Yet, when his spiritual sense touched it, a strange feeling arose, the origin of which was unknown, hinting at hidden secrets.</p><p>His intuition told him not to activate it there.</p><p>With that, Qin Sang patiently entered meditation to recover, before hurriedly leaving the Qi residence and teleporting to the outer lake, finding an uninhabited stretch of water.</p><p>…</p><p>It was deep into the night.</p><p>The moon hung high, a disc of silver.</p><p>Under the moonlight, Qin Sang took out the jade chariot.  As he infused it with his true energy, it shone brilliantly, transforming into a normal chariot size.  The glow echoed the moonlight, adding to its regal splendor—the most divine of chariots.</p><p>Qin Sang tentatively boarded the chariot, sat on the jade seat, and stroked an armrest, attentively sensing the chariot.  The strange feeling grew stronger.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's face contorted!</p><p>A terrifying roar, like a dragon's cry, shook the heavens and earth, causing Qin Sang's soul to tremble.</p><p>Golden light erupted from the front of the chariot, giving birth to a long, slender figure. The figure twisted its body, its head adorned with dragon horns, its body covered in golden scales – a magnificent golden dragon!  Its form was ethereal, yet it seemed like a dragon soul.  The roar was the dragon's cry!</p><p>Overwhelmed, Qin Sang, still unsure of what was happening, suddenly felt something and abruptly looked up at the moon.</p><p>He felt a power emanating from the moon, resonating with the chariot below.</p><p>Two golden chains bound the golden dragon to the chariot. Without Qin Sang’s command, it roared, its tail swayed, its claws stepped on thin air, dragging the chariot, carrying Qin Sang toward the heavens, heading straight for the moon palace.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The night wind howled.</p><p>A dragon chariot soared through the heavens!</p><p>The moon shone even brighter—or rather, its center.</p><p>Upon entering this world, Qin Sang had noticed that the moon seemed to be two overlapping moons, one large and one small.  He felt the inner moon rapidly enlarging in his eyes.  Within the moon seemed to be a strange space, as small as a mustard seed, yet seemingly boundless.  Before the entrance, a celestial gatehouse was faintly visible—dark jade, adorned with glittering jewels, bearing the inscription:</p><p>—South Heavenly Gate!</p><p>At the moment the golden dragon appeared…</p><p>…</p><p>Zhongmao Prefecture altar.</p><p>In the golden hall, a Daoist priest awoke from his meditation.</p><p>…</p><p>Baishi Prefecture altar.</p><p>In the bamboo forest, a female cultivator sat cross-legged, a bronze bell slowly rotating before her, each rotation ringing a clear chime.</p><p>The chimes ceased.</p><p>…</p><p>Gui Fang Kingdom, Grand Sage's Mansion.</p><p>Atop a high altar sat a man, majestic in bearing, wearing an imperial crown and dragon robes. A fragmented map rotated slowly above his head.  Around the altar, figures sat in shadow, their auras powerful.  Suddenly, they all seemed to be struck by something, violently jolting, looking at the man on the altar with apprehension.</p><p>…</p><p>Sword Heart Island.</p><p>In a quiet room, the Sword Master sat cross-legged, eyes closed, a sword wrapped in white cloth stuck in the ground before him.  The sword trembled, emitting a deep hum.  The Sword Master suddenly rose and stepped outside.</p><p>…</p><p>That night, anyone outside admiring the moon in this world could see a dazzling rainbow streaking across the night sky, toward the heavens.</p><p>A celestial being rode a divine chariot, riding a dragon to the moon!</p><p>(End)</p>
