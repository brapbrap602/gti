<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1295: Anomaly</p><p>From Qin Sang's account, Bai learned of the events that transpired during the Blood Lake battle. Bai muttered to himself, "Jade Bones, Brocade Skin... It must be some kind of life-preserving secret technique, transforming oneself into something inhuman to cling to life. That mysterious figure in the water prison, who turned his bones into a bone array, had the same intention."</p><p>Bai pondered for a moment, then said, "Such techniques are not common. If I still had my memories, I would surely recognize his origins. Are you certain his soul has completely dissipated?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "Senior Sister's Azure Phoenix Spirit Puppet is akin to her avatar. During the struggle with Old Demon Ye, it personally touched the Jade Bones and confirmed that the person had perished before giving up the fight."</p><p>"Qing Jun?" Bai nodded slightly, pausing for a moment before shifting the conversation to Old Demon Ye. He was deeply interested in the demon and inquired about every detail.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang had only clashed with Old Demon Ye's avatars twice and had yet to face the demon's true form. During the battle at Twin Mirror Mountain, Old Demon Ye had fallen into a trap, suffered injuries, and fled. Since then, he had rarely appeared, and Qin Sang had not encountered him again.</p><p>"Brother Bai, what are you suspecting?" Qin Sang asked curiously, noticing Bai's relentless questioning about Old Demon Ye.</p><p>Bai replied matter-of-factly, "Your intuition about the Shadow Crystal Tower might not be a mere illusion! How did the Sin Abyss discover the connection between the Sin God Palace and the Purple Palace? Where did the Shadow Crystal Tower come from? How did they know that ancient cultivators were trapped in the Blood Lake, clinging to life? Behind every event, Old Demon Ye's shadow looms. As the foremost figure in the North Star Realm, he must know many hidden secrets!"</p><p>Qin Sang was naturally curious about these matters as well, but Old Demon Ye was not an easy foe to deal with. As long as Old Demon Ye's actions did not threaten him, Qin Sang had no desire to engage in a life-and-death struggle with the demon. He still harbored deep apprehension toward Old Demon Ye.</p><p>Qin Sang already had enough secrets of his own. The Southern Bright Flame and the fragments of the Slaughter Sword were just the beginning. The celestial palace atop the Seven Slaughter Hall awaited his exploration. The Four Saints Palace was the only known inheritance of a Divine Transformation cultivator, with profound foundations. Qin Sang held a token given by Bao Zhengnan, allowing him to visit the Four Saints Palace legitimately in the future.</p><p>If he could unravel these secrets, he might find opportunities to reach the late Nascent Soul stage or even the Divine Transformation stage. Qin Sang had many options and no need to risk his life against Old Demon Ye. At least, before breaking through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, he would not actively seek trouble with the demon.</p><p>With the recent conflict subsiding and the framework of the Green Goat Temple established, Qin Sang planned to focus on his cultivation.</p><p>"Old Demon Ye is cunning and has now firmly decided to withdraw his forces. We will soon reach the walls of Yu City. The Sin Abyss has nowhere to retreat and will undoubtedly fight to the death. By then, Brother Bai should have a chance to face Old Demon Ye. However, before that, I need your help with something..."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone turned cold, a glint of frost flashing in his eyes.</p><p>...</p><p>Only Qin Sang and Qing Jun knew of Bai's return. The next day, Qin Sang led his troops out of the city to pursue the enemy as usual. The Sin Abyss no longer hid its intentions, with its armies racing against time to move resources from the grasslands. What they couldn't take, they destroyed, leaving behind a scene of devastation as they fled like locusts toward Yu City.</p><p>In such a situation, killing enemies was no longer Qin Sang's primary task. Instead, it was to seize resources as quickly as possible. Due to the vastness of the plains, by the third day, Qin Sang had to split his forces with Jing Yu. Jing Yu pursued a remnant force of the Sin Abyss, aiming for a small city ahead, while Qin Sang changed direction to seize a spirit mine.</p><p>For the next few days, the two fought separately, with little chance to reunite. Qing Jun was doing the same, gradually moving further away from them. Throughout this time, Bai never revealed himself.</p><p>Ten days later, Qin Sang led his troops into a city. The Sin Abyss cultivators had long since fled, destroying the city's spirit formations before leaving, leaving only ruins behind. Among the rubble, mortals who lacked the means to escape trembled as they watched the invading cultivators, awaiting their fate.</p><p>Though this was a war between cultivators, mortals inevitably suffered as well. Most cultivators would not harm mortals, but there were those with cruel dispositions. Some demonic cultivators, who required living souls for their techniques, took advantage of the chaos in enemy territory to slaughter indiscriminately.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun could only restrain the cultivators under their command, ensuring such tragedies did not occur around them.</p><p>"Uncle-Master, the cultivator families in the city have all fled, and their treasuries have been emptied. There were several medicinal gardens outside the city, but the spirit herbs have all been destroyed," Li Yufu reported.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Pass the order: we will rest in the city tonight and set out for Yu City tomorrow!"</p><p>"Yes!" Li Yufu withdrew.</p><p>Qin Sang went to the area with the densest spiritual energy in the city and used a spell to create a simple stone hut.</p><p>"It seems your plan has failed," Bai emerged from the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>Earlier, after discovering that Bai had broken through and possessed considerable strength, Qin Sang had devised a plan to lure out the enemy. With the Sin Abyss about to be driven into Yu City, the next phase would either be negotiations or a prolonged stalemate. Such chaos would be hard to come by again.</p><p>Once the situation stabilized, there would be no more opportunities. If Dongyang Bo harbored ill intentions, these few days would be the best time to act. Killing Qin Sang could be blamed on the Sin Abyss. With Senior Sister and Jing Yu by his side, Dongyang Bo would not dare act rashly. Thus, Qin Sang subtly separated from them, deliberately exposing a weakness.</p><p>With Bai's assistance, Qin Sang was confident that even if Old Demon Ye and Cang Hong Zhenren arrived together, they could hold out until Jing Yu and Senior Sister arrived. Of course, this was the worst-case scenario, and Qin Sang believed it highly unlikely. Both old foxes would not easily trust Dongyang Bo's information.</p><p>The main goal was to draw out Dongyang Bo and his accomplices. However, after ten days, everything remained normal. Qin Sang had even intentionally distanced himself from Jing Yu. It was unclear whether Dongyang Bo felt uncertain about dealing with Qin Sang alone and was still biding his time, or if he truly prioritized the greater situation.</p><p>"The more such a high-level opponent hides their intentions, the harder they are to guard against. Fortunately, Shao Hua Mountain is his concern, and he wouldn't resort to extreme measures against me. Otherwise, he would be a significant trouble," Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>At that moment, the barrier outside the stone hut was suddenly disturbed. Qin Sang's divine sense swept out and found Li Yufu rushing back, holding a jade slipâ€”an urgent report.</p><p>"What's happened?" Bai asked curiously, seeing Qin Sang's expression change drastically as he took the jade slip.</p><p>"Brother Bai, you truly are a bringer of fortune!" Qin Sang's expression shifted unpredictably before he uttered this seemingly nonsensical remark to Bai.</p><p>He handed the jade slip to Bai, his tone filled with disbelief. "Just received news: Yu City has suddenly fallen into chaos, and the reason is still unknown... See for yourself, Brother Bai!"</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>These were yesterday's two chapters. I had most of it written last night and planned to finish it this morning, but a wisdom tooth that was misaligned got crushed, and I had to rush to the hospital to have it extracted. The pain felt like it was drilling into my brain all day, but it's finally subsiding a bit now.</p>
