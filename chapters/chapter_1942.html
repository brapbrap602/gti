<h1>Chapter 1933 Jade Melody</h1><p>Zhu Que, seemingly captivated by something, was gesticulating excitedly.</p><p>Xiao Wu lowered his head, following Zhu Que's gaze.</p><p>Below the sheer cliff was a dense jungle.</p><p>Ancient trees towered, their canopies forming an impenetrable barrier, occasionally revealing thick vines, as wide as pythons, snaking down from the crowns.</p><p>‘Chirp… chirp…’</p><p>“Tweet tweet…”</p><p>‘Flap flap!’</p><p>It was a bird's paradise; nests were everywhere in the treetops, while rustling sounds from below indicated animals moving through the undergrowth.</p><p>However, the roars of large predators were scarce;  animals like wolves, tigers, and leopards were presumably rare here.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, one could see traces of human passage, a narrow path worn through the thorns and vegetation.</p><p>It wasn't actually a deep mountain.</p><p>The path led from the outside to this point, vanishing at the base.</p><p>Overgrown with weeds, it was easily missed unless one looked carefully.  Few people used it; likely a hunting trail carved by local hunters.</p><p>Following the path outward, the terrain gradually leveled.  When Qin Sang and the others arrived, they saw a village in the distance.</p><p>Beyond this mountain lay a true wilderness, seldom visited, where wild animals were more abundant.</p><p>Zhu Que was looking at that very path.</p><p>The sun climbed high, its rays dappling the forest. At the far end of the path, a figure appeared.</p><p>The newcomer was a boy, fourteen or fifteen years old, dressed in roughspun clothes and straw sandals – clearly from a poor family. Yet, his clothes were clean, and his brow held a determined air, a hint of scholarly refinement unusual for someone of his background.</p><p>He walked with a bundle of hemp rope in one hand and a sharpened steel pick in the other, his pace surprisingly brisk despite the uneven path.</p><p>His hands, with their large knuckles, showed evidence of training.</p><p>Hunters usually possessed some martial skills; otherwise, venturing into the mountains, let alone hunting wild beasts, would be incredibly difficult.</p><p>Whether he was collecting firewood or hunting, this boy's boldness in entering the mountains alone was remarkable.</p><p>‘Rustle rustle!’</p><p>Not being a cultivator or a martial artist who could traverse walls and leave no footprints in the snow, his movements through the tall grass inevitably made a sound.</p><p>His brow remained furrowed, his vigilance high, constantly scanning for dangers lurking in the undergrowth, pausing frequently to observe.</p><p>Soon, a mountain to the east cast the path and the boy into shadow.</p><p>Here, it became clear he wasn't hunting.  He slowed, carefully examining the mountainside to his right.</p><p>This mountain lacked the towering grandeur of the one Qin Sang and the others were on.</p><p>The slope was alternately steep and gentle, covered in vegetation. Sheer cliffs rose a hundred feet in places; in others, it was easy enough to climb on foot.</p><p>He seemed to be searching for something, moving slowly, shaking his head occasionally, pausing to think.</p><p>Finally, he found a spot that matched his expectations, his eyes lighting up as he quickened his pace.</p><p>His target was a cliff face, about a hundred feet above the path, beyond a gentle slope.</p><p>Before approaching, he looked at the sun, scratched a line in the earth with his pick, surveyed the slope, then with a powerful leap, landed on a rock.  Repeating this several times, he reached the cliff face and looked up.</p><p>The cliff wasn’t particularly tall, perhaps just over a hundred feet, but its face was flat, overgrown with clumps of grass.</p><p>A tenacious tree, with vines intertwined, grew horizontally from a crack in the rock, two vines hanging almost to the ground.</p><p>The cliff wasn't wide; it was flanked by slopes, with a large tree pressed against the right side, also covered in vines.</p><p>He recognized these vines; they were exceptionally strong, suitable for ropes.</p><p>He quickly scanned the entire cliff face, his gaze flickering, seemingly pondering something, finally settling on the top.</p><p>From below, he could see a dark mass – a large boulder projecting out, uneven and seemingly precariously balanced.</p><p>This was his goal. Using the same technique, he leaped from the slope to the cliff top, reached the boulder, and gently pushed it.  It remained unmoved.</p><p>He increased his effort, feeling the large stone shift slightly.  A look of delight crossed his face.  Ignoring the danger, he lay down at the edge of the cliff, observing where the stone met the cliff face, trying to insert the steel chisel.</p><p>Next, he repeatedly moved the chisel and rope up and down, measuring and marking.</p><p>Lost in his work, the boy suddenly remembered something. Looking at the line he’d drawn earlier, he saw the mountain's shadow was about to cross it.  His expression tightened, and he quickly hid the chisel and rope in the grass, running back as fast as he could.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Zhu Que and Xiao Wu, who had been watching with interest, were surprised to see the boy suddenly rushing back as if fleeing a predator.</p><p>“He’ll definitely be back tomorrow,” Zhu Que declared confidently.</p><p>The following day, at the same time, the boy returned as promised.</p><p>This time, he brought a shovel. He retrieved the rope and chisel from the grass and continued his work.  As before, he left promptly when the time came.</p><p>From then on, while Qin Sang was busy repairing the Thunder Altar, the boy became a source of amusement for Zhu Que and Xiao Wu’s otherwise boring days.</p><p>Zhu Que even wanted to bet with Xiao Wu on what the boy was up to, but Xiao Wu wasn't interested.</p><p>This didn't dampen Zhu Que’s enthusiasm; her daily highlight was watching the sunrise.  However, to preserve their curiosity, they refrained from using their supernatural abilities to investigate the boy's intentions.</p><p>Over time, the boy brought new tools each visit.</p><p>Things like wire mesh wrapped with oddly colored nails – likely poisoned.</p><p>Or a wooden shaft with an iron tip, sharpened to a deadly point.</p><p>And various mechanisms.</p><p>These mechanisms were the ingenious inventions of a hunter, cleverly designed for traps.</p><p>The boy experimented for over two weeks before selecting the most suitable mechanism.</p><p>“See! I guessed from the start he was building traps!”</p><p>Zhu Que, satisfied, boasted to Xiao Wu.</p><p>What was puzzling, however, was that the boy's efforts seemed excessive for hunting ordinary animals. There weren't any particularly dangerous beasts in the area; those in the deeper mountains were blocked by the mountain beneath Qin Sang.</p><p>The boy was incredibly patient, working for over a month before finally completing his traps.</p><p>On the final day, he meticulously checked each mechanism, carefully removing any trace of his work, and even brought moss to cover any remaining marks on the stones.</p><p>He didn’t set any bait, nor did he lure any animals.  As usual, he went home when the time came.</p><p>“This kid’s concealment isn’t perfect enough. Let me give him a hand.”</p><p>Zhu Que, eager for excitement, chuckled, flapping her wings.</p><p>For the next three days, the boy didn't reappear, making Zhu Que increasingly restless.  She almost flew to the village to find him and ask what he was doing.</p><p>On the fourth day, at sunrise, the boy finally returned.</p><p>His steps seemed heavier than before, but his pace was still brisk.</p><p>This time, he passed by his traps without stopping, heading straight for their mountain.  It was his first time entering the mountain in days.</p><p>The dense foliage didn’t obstruct Zhu Que and Xiao Wu's vision. They watched as the boy moved through the trees with the agility of a monkey.</p><p>He had a light crossbow strapped to his right arm.  Using a combination of traps and crossbow bolts, he made a good haul.</p><p>Descending the mountain, his bag contained several birds, and he carried a sizable deer.</p><p>Back on the mountain path, the boy checked the time; it was almost his usual departure time.  But this time, he didn’t go home. Instead, he went to his traps, to a pre-selected spot on the north slope of the cliff face, built a fire, took out a bird, gutted it, and placed it over the flames.</p><p>The bird was fat and soon began to sizzle, its aroma spreading far and wide.</p><p>What came next was astonishing. The boy didn't seem to be tempted by the smell of the cooking meat. He pulled out a small knife from his belt, hesitated briefly, then pressed it into his left arm, cutting a deep gash.</p><p>Flesh and blood revealed the wound as bright red blood quickly stained his clothing. The scent of blood mingled with the meat’s aroma.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The boy gasped, tore off a strip of cloth, bit one end, and began to bandage the wound.</p><p>The bleeding wouldn't stop easily, and the cloth soon became soaked.</p><p>His face paled from blood loss, he opened his waterskin and drank deeply before turning his attention back to the cooking meat.</p><p>Soon…</p><p>A white figure suddenly flashed on the mountaintop where the boy was, disappearing instantly.</p><p>“It’s coming!”</p><p>Zhuque, who was watching, lowered her voice involuntarily, her eyes shining with excitement.</p><p>“No wonder! So he's hunting a demon!  This kid must have guts of steel!”</p><p>Xiao Wu’s eyes also flickered.</p><p>The white figure's movements couldn't escape their eyes; it was a white weasel, a common demon.</p><p>While human warriors who reach the innate stage possess considerable strength and might potentially kill low-level Qi-refining cultivators, the boy clearly wasn't one of those top experts.  Daring to lure a weasel to its death was incredibly reckless.</p><p>The weasel moved stealthily, gliding through the grass without a sound, silently approaching the boy from behind before suddenly attacking.</p><p>The boy, seemingly focused on grilling meat, had actually kept his senses sharp. But the weasel was too fast. By the time he sensed the wind, he didn't even have time to dodge.</p><p>The weasel closed in instantly, its sharp claws slashing towards the boy's back.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The sound was that of metal colliding with metal.</p><p>Underneath his torn clothes, iron plates were revealed.</p><p>Based on the bodies of the Master and others, and accounts from survivors, the boy had deduced that this beast favored surprise attacks, targeting the back.  He had prepared iron plates for protection.</p><p>However, the weasel’s claws were incredibly sharp, piercing the iron plates!</p><p>The boy felt a sharp pain in his back, and a terrifying force slammed into him through the plates. He instinctively lunged forward.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The boy tumbled headfirst towards the stone wall, taking the grilling rack with him, landing in the sand below.</p><p>His whole body ached, his internal organs displaced.</p><p>Even so, before hitting the ground, he managed to twist his body, aiming the light crossbow on his right arm behind him.</p><p>Failing to kill its prey, the weasel shrieked.</p><p>“Squeak!”</p><p>The cry was extremely piercing.</p><p>At the same time, the weasel turned into a white blur, leaping down after the boy, continuing the chase.  It shook its chin, releasing a puff of white smoke that enveloped the boy.</p><p>The boy, well-prepared, had already closed his eyes and held his breath.  Despite his precautions, the shriek made his head buzz, leaving him slightly dazed—even though he’d stuffed cotton in his ears.</p><p>The smoke and shriek were terrifying demon arts. The village's most skilled hunter had died from this sorcery, helpless, leaving the villagers terrified.</p><p>Luckily, this weasel wouldn't appear in the morning. The villagers only dared to move about in the morning; after noon, they would close their doors and windows, and no one dared to hunt demons.</p><p>His preparations proved somewhat effective. The boy didn't lose consciousness immediately.  With sheer willpower, he raised his left arm and fired his crossbow.</p><p>As the weasel pounced, it looked as though his left arm would be torn to shreds. Fortunately, he had also bound iron plates to his forearm, but even they were torn, leaving a deep wound to the bone.</p><p>‘Whizz! Whizz! Whizz!’</p><p>Three crossbow bolts shot out, their tips reflecting a blue glow, having been previously poisoned.</p><p>The weasel was forced to evade, twisting its body in an impossible contortion to avoid the bolts, escaping unharmed.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The boy crashed to the ground, spitting blood.</p><p>The weasel looked greedily at the vibrant body, leaping down.</p><p>Just then, something triggered a mechanism. The sand on the ground flew up.</p><p>On either side of the trees, two curved branches straightened simultaneously with a bang.</p><p>The vines hanging from the branches were pulled from the sand.</p><p>Several vines were tightly bound to a wire mesh that sprang from the ground, creating a net.  The weasel was about to be caught and impaled by the nails.</p><p>Being a seasoned demon beast, the weasel reacted swiftly, grabbing the edge of the net and leaping high.</p><p>But this was not the end of the traps.  As the net sprung up, a further mechanism triggered. A vine clinging to the stone wall was pulled, dislodging a large rock from the edge of the cliff.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gust of wind ruffled the weasel’s fur.</p><p>The weasel was completely enveloped in the shadow of the falling rock.  With its cultivation, being struck would shatter its bones.</p><p>“Squeak!”</p><p>The weasel shrieked in furious rage.</p><p>‘Puff! Thwack!’</p><p>At the last moment, the weasel hastily released a puff of white smoke to slow the rock.  It grabbed the edge of the rock with its forepaws, digging its hind paws into the ground, performing a somersault to avoid the falling rock.</p><p>But this was not all.  As the rock fell, a third trap was sprung.  The ground clicked, and cold steel flashed from the grass.</p><p>On both sides, five poisoned spears shot out, taking advantage of the weasel's airborne position, unable to gain purchase.</p><p>‘Swish! Whizz! Whizz! Whizz! Whizz!’</p><p>The spears’ force was comparable to a crossbow, swift as lightning.</p><p>Ten poisoned spears crisscrossed, leaving the seasoned weasel no escape.  Its enraged shriek turned into a terrified scream.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Demon blood trailed a crimson line on the ground.</p><p>A spear pierced the weasel, its tip deeply embedded in a tree trunk, its shaft still trembling.</p><p>“Magnificent!”</p><p>Zhuque clapped her wings. “Such a pity.  This weasel has a cultivator's aura; it must have been someone's pet. This boy is in trouble.”</p>
