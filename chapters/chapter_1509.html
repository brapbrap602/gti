<h1>Chapter 1500: A Plea for Survival</h1><p>Chapter 1500: A Plea for Survival</p><p>Thunderclouds gathered.</p><p>Above the sinkhole, the clouds churned.</p><p>A Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>Qin Sang was closer to Yin Changsheng than the cultivators outside, feeling the tribulation more acutely.  Even knowing it wasn't targeting him, he felt an instinctive unease.</p><p>"It's finally here!"</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.  He had played a part in bringing this about.</p><p>After realizing escape from the cavern was impossible, Qin Sang had racked his brains, simultaneously fending off Yin Changsheng's attacks and desperately searching for a way to turn the tide.</p><p>Initially, his goal was the Blood Pool of Slaughter.  This was a desperate measure.  While it angered Yin Changsheng, it didn't change his predicament; he still had to fight.  And Yin Changsheng wouldn't leave the Blood Pool, making it impossible for Qin Sang to succeed easily.</p><p>Until Yin Changsheng summoned the Hanging Sword Pavilion.  It seemed like a dead end, but it secretly held a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Qin Sang keenly sensed that Yin Changsheng's madness was intensifying.  The evil sorcery was eroding his sanity.  As long as Qin Sang persevered, Yin Changsheng's descent into demonic possession was imminent.</p><p>Upon realizing this, Qin Sang immediately shifted his strategy.  Yin Changsheng was using evil sorcery to avoid the tribulation, clinging to life. His greatest fear was the Heavenly Tribulation itself.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation was his heart demon!</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly's thunderclap ability was superficial, but it could draw out his heart demon.</p><p>However, success required precise timing to avoid being discovered by Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Qin Sang used himself as bait, utilizing Liuli, to successfully launch a surprise attack with the Solar God Bird.  Even if it couldn't kill Yin Changsheng, it created an opening to unleash the tribulation's thunder.</p><p>It worked!</p><p>While relieved, Qin Sang felt utterly exhausted.  His external avatar and Liuli were both depleted. His own spiritual energy was almost gone.</p><p>After reaching the Yuan Ying stage, Qin Sang always prepared escape routes before engaging in battle. This was the first time he'd faced such a perilous situation, leaving no room for retreat.</p><p>"As expected, it's a direct thunder tribulation."</p><p>Feeling the power of the Heavenly Tribulation, this thought crossed Qin Sang's mind.  Breakthroughs involved wind, fire, thunder, and heart demon tribulations.  The three-hundred-year Heavenly Tribulation involved only thunder, but its power was terrifying—designed to obliterate.</p><p>Especially since Yin Changsheng had used evil sorcery to delay it for countless years.  This tribulation would be earth-shattering.</p><p>Realizing he was in the cavern, so close to Yin Changsheng, a chill ran down Qin Sang's spine.  Without hesitation, he flashed to Liuli and his avatar.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved his external avatar into the Corpse Puppet Bag and recalled the Solar God Tree, not even glancing at this great contributor before tossing it into his Qianjun Ring. He was too weak to control it now.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang helped Liuli up, retreated to the edge of the cavern, gulped down a handful of spirit pills, activated the Ruyi Treasure Orb to protect them both, and pressed tightly against the stone wall, wishing he could merge with it.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Liuli's trembling body.  His expression softened, a sigh escaping his lips.</p><p>Moments before, Liuli had willingly relinquished her imprint, allowing him complete control.  At that moment, Qin Sang could have done anything to her, and she wouldn't have been able to resist; he could even have easily planted suggestions in her mind.</p><p>She had chosen to trust him.</p><p>Qin Sang, naturally, wouldn't take advantage of her.  Besides, Liuli had been instrumental in pushing Yin Changsheng to the brink of demonic possession.</p><p>He stayed true to his principles.  After summoning the three divine birds, he immediately severed the connection with Liuli, avoiding any further interaction, not even the slightest touch upon her spirit.</p><p>But was that enough to eliminate the risk?</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Liuli's pale face.  Her current state clearly indicated it wasn't that simple.</p><p>To completely surrender oneself, to be controlled by another – the thought was terrifying.  Any trace left behind would be an inescapable nightmare for Liuli.  No one could predict the lasting impact.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the cicada molt in his Qianjun Ring, which he hadn't yet given to Liuli.  Would she still be able to break through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage as planned with the treasure's help?</p><p>Amidst his swirling thoughts...</p><p>The oppressive pressure intensified.</p><p>Within the thick thunderclouds, thunder roared incessantly.  Azure arcs of lightning, like untamed horses, leaped across the churning clouds, waves of energy surging wildly towards the center, aiming at the sinkhole.</p><p>The faint light at the heart of the thundercloud suddenly blazed, and countless lightning bolts descended from the sky, instantly transforming into a furious storm.</p><p>The mountain trembled.  The black mist boiled and surged.</p><p>This was the breakthrough point Yin Changsheng had chosen, prepared for the tribulation.  But he was now possessed, and the tribulation’s sudden arrival left him no time to react.</p><p>Under the relentless bombardment of lightning, the cavern's ceiling finally shattered.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!…</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed the cave ceiling being pierced by a thunderstorm.</p><p>The thunder in the stone cave was deafening, drowning out all other sounds.  A blinding blue light flashed.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed her eyes, a look of horror flashing across her face.  She wondered how many heavenly tribulations Yin Changsheng had already endured, the power of this one was terrifying.</p><p>Yin Changsheng, his face still dazed, suddenly looked up. This time, it was a true heavenly tribulation.</p><p>"Damn heavens!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng's roar was swallowed by the thunder. He didn't give up, however. He forcefully activated the Xuanjian Tower. The treasure soared into the air with a brilliant glow, like a rainbow,  shooting upwards to meet the tribulation thunder.</p><p>For a moment, blue light and rainbow light intertwined in a chaotic dance.  The booming sounds continued as the two forces collided and annihilated each other.  Strange phenomena unfolded, with threads of light flickering within the rainbow, creating a strangely beautiful spectacle.</p><p>The tribulation thunder, weakened somewhat by the ancient prohibitions etched into the cave ceiling, still relentlessly shattered the rainbow light.  This tribulation felt like the heavens unleashing centuries of pent-up rage.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!…</p><p>The tribulation thunder relentlessly struck.  A torrent of blue lightning descended. The Xuanjian Tower hovered above Yin Changsheng, faithfully protecting its master.</p><p>Yin Changsheng, displaying incredible power, fought the tribulation thunder, but ultimately, both he and the Xuanjian Tower were struck into the ground. The thunderclouds didn’t dissipate; he was still alive!</p><p>The remaining energy surged through the cave, painting the entire cavern in a bluish hue.  But this was only the first strike. The thunderclouds churned faster, and the lightning bolts grew thicker.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang, forgetting her astonishment at Yin Changsheng's resilience, grabbed Liuli, pushed off the ground, and flew toward the edge of the chasm, seeking to escape the cave.</p><p>As they neared the chasm's edge, Qin Sang caught a glimpse of the cave's center. The ice coffin had been thrown by the tribulation thunder, and the Lu Yin Blood Pool was cracked; the only ice platform visible was gone.  Blood flowed steadily.  From within the pool, a figure struggled to get out.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's injuries weren't life-threatening.  She was partly restrained by Yin Changsheng's enchantment and partly by the blood pool.  The blood pool's destruction, however, had shielded her from the full force of the tribulation thunder, freeing her from some of her constraints. She was desperately trying to escape the pool's grasp.</p>
