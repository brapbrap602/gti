<h1>Chapter 1934: The Martial Dao</h1><p>“What is a Ghost Cloud Steed?”</p><p>Zhu Que heard of this demonic beast for the first time. Remembering that Luo Hou was still a spirit, she suddenly understood.  “You want to perform a body snatching?”</p><p>Luo Hou had been injured by Qin Sang years ago and hadn’t found a suitable body. She was unwilling to settle for anything less, so she waited until now.</p><p>Luo Hou neither confirmed nor denied this, replying, “The Ghost Cloud Steed’s bloodline has a certain degree of compatibility with my own race.”</p><p>If she were to perform a body snatching, she didn’t need to limit herself to the Shadow Horse clan.  She could choose a bloodline with similar characteristics for a new body.</p><p>Luo Hou had several options; the Ghost Cloud Steed was just one of them.</p><p>Luo Hou’s expression showed some hesitation. Firstly, this Ghost Cloud Steed's bloodline was weak. Secondly, it wasn't the best choice, only mediocre at best.</p><p>But the demonic beasts she considered, including the Ghost Cloud Steed, were all extremely rare. It had taken a long time to find this one.</p><p>Deep within the Mulu Mountains, there might be better options.  She considered herself fortunate to have survived as a defeated general and become a mountain spirit guardian.  She wouldn't dare ask her master to make a special trip to find a body for her.</p><p>Moreover, the situation in the Mulu Mountains was complex, full of formidable cultivators, and extremely dangerous.</p><p>As a mere spirit, her power was weakened.  She could easily deal with a demonic cultivator of the level of the Golden-winged Roc, but against someone of her own level, she was somewhat lacking. She dared not venture into the Mulu Mountains alone.</p><p>Encountering a Ghost Cloud Steed was a moderate stroke of luck.</p><p>Though possessing the Ghost Cloud Steed wouldn’t be as compatible as other demonic beasts, it still offered a chance of restoring her to her peak state, albeit with greater effort.</p><p>If she missed this opportunity, she didn’t know how long she’d have to wait.  Lacking a physical body significantly impacted her cultivation.  The sooner she possessed one, the better.</p><p>“What are you waiting for? Go, go, go!”</p><p>Zhu Que urged repeatedly, clamoring, “I’ll deal with this thing.  It dares to call itself a Demon Emperor in front of this divine bird! Let it learn its lesson!”</p><p>Zhu Que rubbed her claws together, her tone arrogant.</p><p>But Luo Hou didn’t move, hesitating. “But, my master…”</p><p>“Why worry about that?  Will Qin ever stop you from possessing a body? He brought you down the mountain to help you recover. Otherwise, why didn't he bring the fox?”</p><p>Zhu Que, showing some cleverness, her eyes rolling, guessed Luo Hou’s concerns and suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p>“Ha ha… You actually believed him?  He claims he won't kill, but isn't it to help Xiao Wu dissipate his demonic intent? He didn't specifically instruct us to show mercy. Do you think Qin is a rigid pedant, or do you really think your master is a great benevolent person?”</p><p>“Ha ha ha ha…”</p><p>Zhu Que seemed to have heard the funniest joke and laughed until her sides hurt.</p><p>Following Qin Sang on her travels, she had learned many new words, such as ‘rigid pedant’.</p><p>Her laughter reached the Golden-winged Roc's ears, inflaming its anger.</p><p>The other party was pursuing him yet dared to be distracted by conversation and unrestrained laughter. This was utterly humiliating.</p><p>Luo Hou remained hesitant. Since Qin Sang descended the mountain, he had been slaying demonic beasts, causing rivers of blood.  Possessing someone else's body was undoubtedly the act of a demon, even though the Ghost Cloud Steed had certainly slaughtered many people.</p><p>Unlike Zhu Que, she did not have the privilege of arrogance to ignore Qin Sang’s words.</p><p>“Oh my, you’re so timid! Can you do it or not?  Why don't you just ask Qin? Quickly go capture that Ghost Steed before it escapes!”</p><p>Zhu Que flapped her wings, condensing a flame feather into a crimson streak of light that pierced the air.</p><p>Luo Hou left the Golden-winged Roc to Zhu Que and leaped towards the Ghost Cloud Steed.</p><p>Zhu Que shook her wings, glancing sideways at the furious Golden-winged Roc, letting out a cackling laugh.</p><p>“You are doomed!”</p><p>Zhu Que, having learned more elegant words from the human world, roared, her entire body engulfed in blazing flames as she lunged at the Golden-winged Roc.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>The Golden-winged Roc didn't back down verbally, but still didn't turn around. However, it was easily caught by Zhu Que, and upon engaging in combat, it immediately realized something was amiss.</p><p>Zhu Que seemingly only possessed the cultivation of a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, comparable to the Golden-winged Roc, but it absolutely could not be viewed as an ordinary demonic beast.</p><p>Moreover, the Demon Emperor had just suffered a blow from Luo Hou and was already injured.  It quickly fell into a disadvantage and was swallowed by an overwhelming sea of fire.</p><p>The palace was breached, and the Demon Emperor was preoccupied with self-preservation.</p><p>Other demonic beasts acted independently, a disorganized mess, unable to mount a proper offensive.  They retreated steadily, escape itself a distant hope.</p><p>Luo Hou captured the Ghost Cloud Steed, moving like a phantom, clearing the battlefield.  The demonic horde could only surrender.</p><p>Above the capital city, Zhuque and the Demon Emperor battled.</p><p>"No one interfere!"</p><p>Zhuque's roar echoed through the flames.  This was her chance, and she intended to make the most of it.</p><p>"Senior Luo, what should we do now?"</p><p>A cultivator approached.</p><p>Luo Hou watched for a moment, confirming the Golden-winged Roc's escape was impossible.  "Let the divine bird have its fun. We'll reinforce elsewhere! Let's go!"</p><p>"Fun?"</p><p>The others looked at each other in astonishment.  To simply play against a late-stage demon—it was utterly unbelievable!</p><p>With reinforcements arriving, the other two battlefields collapsed as easily as crumbling ruins.</p><p>Three demonic lairs were destroyed overnight!</p><p>Finally, everyone rushed towards the capital of Wanling Kingdom.  The battle wasn't over, but the Golden-winged Roc was already exhausted.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A fiery blast slammed into the ground, like a meteor, destroying half the palace in a earth-shattering explosion!</p><p>When the flames cleared…</p><p>Everyone saw a small Zhuque, one foot planted on the head of the Golden-winged Roc, a creature vastly larger than itself.</p><p>Zhuque preened her feathers, surveying the scene with pride.</p><p>Amidst the praises, her little head bobbed higher and higher, her beak almost touching the sky.</p><p>Su Xuan and others cleaned up the mess. The three demons, their task complete, vanished.</p><p>Zhuque stopped Luo Hou, shaking a fiery feather.  "Your master has agreed.  Hurry up and find a new body. What are you waiting for?"</p><p>"Please protect me, fellow Daoists!"</p><p>Luo Hou didn't question it, making a swift decision. She landed on a mountaintop with the Ghost Cloud Steed.</p><p>Zhuque and Taiyi guarded her, one on each side.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day at noon.</p><p>The three demons returned to Taiyi's cave.</p><p>Qin Sang was studying the Taiyi Thunderbolt Talisman.  Seeing Luo Hou, he was surprised.  "You found a new body yourself? I was planning to go to Mulu Mountain anyway.  This saves me the trouble.  Take these pills.  Adapt to your new body quickly and recover your strength.”</p><p>He tossed a jade bottle.</p><p>Inside were three extremely valuable pills, obtained from the remains of a demon king, specially made for demons, greatly beneficial to Luo Hou.</p><p>Luo Hou then understood that Qin Sang had remembered her all along, and immediately knelt, grateful. "Thank you, Master, for the pills."</p><p>"See? I told you he'd agree.  And you had to ask…"</p><p>Zhuque hopped onto Luo Hou's shoulder, smug.</p><p>"Ask?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Zhuque.</p><p>Zhuque quickly covered her mouth, her eyes darting around, then she dashed for the door, but a powerful force yanked her back, causing her to scream.</p><p>"Luo Hou needs to focus on refining her body and can no longer be a mount. You'll take over from now on!"</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the screams, raised his hand, and Zhuque's flames erupted.</p><p>"Master…"</p><p>Luo Hou opened her mouth, but Qin Sang’s glance silenced her.</p><p>Shortly after, a large red-feathered bird soared into the sky, carrying everyone, leaving behind a heart-wrenching scream.</p><p>"Ah! I, the noble Zhuque!"</p><p>…</p><p>Fire Domain, Daoist Grounds.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body awoke from meditation, calculated with his fingers, muttering, "It's almost time for my appointment with the Cloud Tripod City Lord."</p><p>Restoring his foundation was no longer a problem. Qin Sang now considered his next priorities in cultivation.</p><p>Rushing into the pursuit of the Dao of Slaughter was unwise.</p><p>Seeking the Dao—the most important thing was understanding the Dao itself, the sudden enlightenment that brings this understanding.</p><p>His true body wouldn't fare any better than his avatar.</p><p>Leaving it to his avatar to continue his journey through the mortal world, seeking opportunities, might be the best choice.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body needed to quickly achieve strength comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Some of his previous abilities and treasures were insufficient.</p><p>Especially his three powerful Buddha Seals, his most significant tools before the Nascent Soul stage, were now limited by his strength cultivation.</p><p>Comprehending thunder techniques wouldn't bring extraordinary results quickly, unless the Thunder Altar surprised him.</p><p>He had two choices.</p><p>One: rapidly improve his strength cultivation, breaking through the sixth layer of *Heavenly Demon Transformation*.</p><p>Two: comprehend the Seven Constellations Divergent Sword Formation, using the *Purple Micro Sword Scripture* and the sword light of Heaven Transcendent, to deduce a sword domain from the formation.</p><p>Even a hint of the sword domain's essence would give me a significant advantage against a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>A breakthrough in swordsmanship would undoubtedly lead to a quantum leap in strength, but the difficulty is undeniably high.</p><p>For over three hundred years, Qin Sang has pondered his approach.</p><p>Gradually, he developed a plan, though it remains untested.</p><p>The hints dropped by the Transcendent One Tian Yue were subtly guiding him.</p><p>Using a sword array to mimic the celestial constellations is a daunting task, and Qin Sang dare not be so ambitious yet.</p><p>Creating the Celestial Constellation Sword Array must be a gradual process. He plans to emulate the Seven Mansion Sword Array, starting with the Southern, Eastern, and Northern Seven Mansions.</p><p>Once the Four Symbols are complete, the Four Symbols Sword Array will be achieved!</p><p>This would mark a minor success.  Then, he will incorporate the Sun, Moon, and Nine Luminaries, the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, the Great Brightness Enclosure, and the Heavenly Market Enclosure, eventually culminating in the complete Celestial Constellation Sword Array.</p><p>It's an ambitious plan, and Qin Sang isn't sure if he can complete it during his Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Images flashed through Qin Sang's mind – his memories from the Divine Court.</p><p>He recalled his escape from the Demon King, the scenes from the Western White Tiger star region.</p><p>And the moment when the Thunder Ancestor possessed him, granting him control over heaven and earth, allowing him to stand above both the Divine Court and the world.</p><p>This mental imprint seemed to contain fragmented impressions of the Divine Court, the four star regions, the Three Enclosures and the Four Symbols and Twenty-Eight Mansions.</p><p>His consciousness was hazy then, and subsequent attacks left his memories extremely faint.</p><p>Qin Sang is unsure how much he can glean from this, but if he manages to grasp even a small insight and use the Divine Court's essence to build his array, it will be incredibly efficient!</p><p>This is undoubtedly a shortcut compared to directly observing the ethereal celestial constellations.</p><p>Of course, a breakthrough in the *Heavenly Demon Refining Form* would grant powerful combat abilities through the Three Great Buddha Seals.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his fingers against his knee.</p><p>He previously requested the Lord of Cloud Tripod City to gather potent poisons.  It's almost time to collect them.</p><p>The *Poison God Scripture* is secondary. He mused that he should focus on comprehending the Dharma Aspect. The deeper his understanding, the smoother his future breakthroughs would be.</p><p>Different paths have common ground.  As a Nascent Soul cultivator, his understanding of the harmony between man and nature benefits his comprehension of Dharma Aspects.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A violent wind swept through the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Dharma Aspect.</p><p>He looked up at his Vermillion Bird Dharma Aspect, carefully sensing it.</p><p>Previously, after receiving guidance from Left Master, he learned about the concepts of internal and external scenes in body cultivation, but his understanding remained vague.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang has gained some insight.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators who manipulate the energy of heaven and earth emphasize control.</p><p>The transition from internal to external scenes in body cultivation also involves the harmony between man and nature, but it involves absorbing heaven and earth into oneself, with the self as the master.</p><p>It's like absorbing the power of heaven and earth, nourishing oneself, creating one's inner heaven and earth, and thus, in turn, influencing the true heaven and earth.</p><p>What about the Yang God?</p><p>Is it rooted in heaven and earth, with the soul actively merging with them?</p><p>The most extreme path: abandoning the self, entrusting oneself to heaven and earth, coexisting with them?</p><p>This seems somewhat similar to the paths of divinities rooted in mountain ranges or sustained by incense offerings.</p><p>Qin Sang considered this, recalling the Yang God that attacked him in the Divine Court; its figure was like a ghost, its movement impossible to trace.</p><p>Do these three different paths represent the three ultimate paths for beings to seek the Dao, with subsequent branching and diversification into various paths?</p><p>These are the results of Qin Sang's continuous contemplation.</p><p>He knows there are many flaws, but it doesn't matter. As his cultivation progresses, he will gradually refine them and comprehend the true essence of the Dao.</p><p>This process is a journey of seeking the Dao, and also a transformation and sublimation of the self!</p><p>“Dao! Dao! Dao!”</p><p>Qin Sang repeated the word.</p><p>It has been proven that the higher the realm, the greater the importance of the 'Dao', and the less the influence of innate talent.</p><p>At the Nascent Soul stage, who cares if you have five spiritual roots?</p><p>Of course, the speed of comprehending the Dao is also a kind of talent.</p><p>Some have sudden enlightenment, others spend a lifetime struggling.</p><p>“This is intuition, right?  But high or low intuition doesn't determine future achievements. It can be compensated for through external means and insights.”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Vermillion Bird Dharma Aspect.</p><p>The Dharma Aspect is an external manifestation of the power of the inner heaven and earth. With his understanding at the Nascent Soul stage, his intuition in comprehending the Dharma Aspect is surely unparalleled.</p><p>Qin Sang silently practiced the *Heavenly Demon Refining Form*.</p><p>Several days later.</p><p>The cave's stone door opened.  Qin Sang emerged, refreshed, instructing Gui Hou to guard the home, then flew out of the training grounds.</p><p>He flew leisurely across the Fire Region, reaching Cloud Capital Mountain, observing the changes below.</p><p>It appears that in over two hundred years, Cloud Capital Mountain has not changed, at least superficially it is peaceful.</p><p>Under Cloud Capital Heaven's governance, Cloud Capital Mountain enjoys lasting peace, a blessing for cultivators.</p><p>Cloud Tripod City.</p><p>Qin Sang only visits this immortal city every few decades, yet every guard knows his name.</p><p>Upon entering the city, the guard commander personally led him directly to the highest level of Cloud Tripod City.</p><p>The City Lord personally came out to greet him.</p>
