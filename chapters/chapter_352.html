<h1>Chapter 345: The Strange Being</h1><p>In the cultivation world, the strong prey on the weak.</p><p>Only Foundation Establishment cultivators can truly gain a foothold and possess the power to protect themselves during their travels.</p><p>Tan Hao couldn't break through to Foundation Establishment, so everything else was moot.</p><p>Otherwise, it was more likely that Tan Hao would die on the road to reviving Tan Jie.</p><p>All this effort would be in vain.</p><p>Qin Sang simply wanted Wandering Scholar to give Tan Hao some guidance. He himself had only broken through to Foundation Establishment thanks to the Dragon Ginseng and the Sect Leader's personal protection. He had stumbled into it himself and wouldn't know where to begin to guide Tan Hao.</p><p>He hadn't expected Wandering Scholar to be so generous, directly gifting him a Jade Clarity Pill.</p><p>Looking at the two spirit pills in front of him, Tan Hao, a burly man, was at a loss for words.</p><p>He was reluctant to refuse.</p><p>But he couldn't accept them for free.</p><p>At this moment, Tan Hao's mind was filled with one thought: "How could I deserve this?"</p><p>Among rogue cultivators, who dared to dream of obtaining a Foundation Establishment Pill?</p><p>Not every disciple of a cultivation sect received one.</p><p>Moreover, Tan Hao had spent most of his savings on Tan Jie's treatment; to say he was destitute wouldn't be an exaggeration.</p><p>Tan Hao knew clearly that even if he sold himself, he couldn't afford these two spirit pills. He couldn't think of anything he could do for Qin Sang and Wandering Scholar to repay this kindness.</p><p>"Take them!"</p><p>Wandering Scholar pressed the Jade Clarity Pill into Tan Hao's palm, speaking with deep emotion.</p><p>"I was deeply moved when Brother Qin told me about your righteous deed. Even without Brother Qin's connection, I would be willing to offer what little help I can.</p><p>"The bond between you brothers... I can't fully comprehend.</p><p>"But your decades of unwavering dedication show the astonishing power contained within this bond.</p><p>"The Jade Clarity Pill is not a precious item, far less valuable than a Foundation Establishment Pill. Besides, I'm not giving it to you for free. Reflecting on your experiences has given me pause and some faint insights.</p><p>"Perhaps, because of this encounter, my Dao Heart will advance further. Consider this pill a reward!"</p><p>Qin Sang also placed the Foundation Establishment Pill into Tan Hao's hand, pointing at the crystal coffin. "Don't just think about yourself, think about Tan Jie, think about your unwavering resolve. If you don't reach Foundation Establishment, you'll be stuck in your cave forever. How will you travel the world? How will you cure Tan Jie? Do you want him to lie in this coffin, half-dead, for the rest of his life?"</p><p>Wandering Scholar echoed Qin Sang's words.</p><p>"Brother Qin is right. We admire this quality in you, and that's why we're willing to help.</p><p>"Consider this an opportunity, earned through decades of hardship and perseverance.</p><p>"Since we're talking about unwavering resolve, let me offer a few words of wisdom gleaned from my own cultivation journey, which greatly aided me during my Foundation Establishment. Just listen and consider them.</p><p>"Some say that cultivation is the pursuit of freedom and requires tempering one's state of mind. If one harbors unresolved attachments, one will be plagued by inner demons. Being trapped at a bottleneck is a minor issue; the true danger lies in the proliferation of inner demons and succumbing to demonic influence.</p><p>"But everyone has their own path, how can they be the same?</p><p>"In my opinion, having unwavering resolve is not necessarily a bad thing.</p><p>"It was precisely because of my own resolve that I never gave up, never feared any hardship, and steadfastly pursued my own Dao.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Tan, your experiences are complex, you must have similar insights.</p><p>"Before preparing for your breakthrough, carefully reflect on your past. Whether you choose to let go or become even more resolute, it will be your own unique understanding.</p><p>"Perhaps it will help you with your Foundation Establishment."</p><p>Hearing Wandering Scholar's words, Qin Sang became thoughtful.</p><p>Wandering Scholar was speaking to Tan Hao, but perhaps he was also speaking to himself.</p><p>Tan Hao seemed to have grasped something, lost in thought.</p><p>Wandering Scholar walked to the crystal coffin. Seeing Tan Jie's state, he let out a soft "Eh?" He bent down to observe for a moment, a look of surprise flashing in his eyes. He glanced at Tan Hao but said nothing.</p><p>That night.</p><p>Qin Sang was cultivating when he sensed someone triggering the restriction. It was Wandering Scholar.</p><p>"I hope I'm not disturbing your cultivation, Brother Qin?"</p><p>"Please come in, Senior..."</p><p>Qin Sang invited Wandering Scholar in, his expression puzzled. He wondered why Wandering Scholar was visiting so late at night.</p><p>Wandering Scholar came in and got straight to the point. "Brother Qin, I wanted to ask you about the strange technique used to seal Tan Jie..."</p><p>"Are you interested, Senior?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought that Wandering Scholar might have noticed something.</p><p>However, he wasn't alarmed. Demonic Corpse Refining techniques weren't uncommon, and he could easily explain it away as something obtained from a demonic cultivator.</p><p>He had been cautious before because he didn't want to attract trouble.</p><p>Corpse Refining was just a means to an end, and his purpose was to save someone. As long as he didn't use Corpse Refining to harm others like demonic cultivators, the righteous sects wouldn't exterminate him simply for knowing the technique.</p><p>Wandering Scholar shook his head.</p><p>"I sensed a familiar aura from Tan Jie, very similar to a strange being I encountered before. I have a feeling it might be related to your technique.</p><p>"I know a place where spirit herbs that can heal dark soul injuries might exist. However, it's extremely dangerous, and I had planned to wait until at least late Foundation Establishment before venturing in.</p><p>"A large part of the reason was the presence of this strange being.</p><p>"If Brother Qin has a way to deal with that strange being, I'm prepared to try now. If I succeed, I won't have to worry about it until I reach Core Formation."</p><p>"Strange being?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought that the aura Wandering Scholar sensed was likely the change in Tan Jie's primordial spirit after merging with the Celestial Corpse Talisman. Could it be that he had seen a living corpse sealed by a Celestial Corpse Talisman before?</p><p>If it was a living corpse, why describe it as a strange being?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't plan to focus on cultivating the *Celestial Yin Corpse Art*, but he was very interested in using Corpse Refining as a combat method, especially the secret technique to enhance a living corpse into a Flying Night Fiend.</p><p>A Flying Night Fiend was equivalent in strength to a Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>Perhaps not as powerful as a true Core Formation cultivator, but certainly stronger than a Foundation Establishment cultivator. If he could refine one, he could dominate the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p>The *Celestial Yin Corpse Art* allowed the creation of a Flying Night Fiend without needing a Golden Core corpse, a remarkable feat.</p><p>Unfortunately, he only possessed the first half of the *Celestial Yin Corpse Art*.</p><p>After returning from the Celestial Corpse Cave, Qin Sang had investigated the Celestial Corpse Sect and discovered that it wasn't well-known. Because they used Earthly Yin Qi for Corpse Refining, a method different from other techniques, they were only occasionally mentioned.</p><p>The records in ancient texts were brief and vague.</p><p>This suggested that the Celestial Corpse Sect was either weak or short-lived, in any case, insignificant.</p><p>Unable to find any clues about the second half of the *Celestial Yin Corpse Art*, Qin Sang had eventually given up.</p><p>The strange being Wandering Scholar spoke of, if it was a living corpse, might be related to the Celestial Corpse Sect.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang became quite intrigued.</p><p>"Senior, could you tell me more about this strange being?"</p>
