<h1>Chapter 670: A Moment of Calm</h1><p>The tamed demonic beasts possessed immense strength and could even cast simple spells.  Their tireless efforts propelled the caravan much faster than anticipated.</p><p>The next day, Qin Sang became acquainted with the two other passengers in her carriage.</p><p>Ran Luo, also traveling in the same carriage, had responsibilities assisting Elder Zou in coordinating the caravan and rarely appeared.</p><p>The other two were a man and a woman, both in the early stages of Core Formation.  They were unsurprised by Qin Sang's attire and didn't pry.</p><p>The man, Ning Kun, was, like Ran Luo, a manager for the Qiongyu Trading Company.</p><p>However, after boarding, Qin Sang noticed Ning Kun, despite his high cultivation, was clearly suffering from blood deficiency and appeared wounded.  She later learned he had recently arrived in Pingbo Port after escorting a Qiongyu trading vessel.</p><p>During the voyage, they had unfortunately encountered rampaging demonic beasts that attacked the ship. He fought them off, saving the vessel, but sustained serious injuries.</p><p>He had intended to recuperate in Pingbo Port but had to join the caravan while wounded.</p><p>The other cultivator was a female Daoist, Daoist Huiwen.  She wasn't affiliated with the Qiongyu Trading Company but was close friends with Ran Luo, having been invited along.</p><p>“Thankfully Elder Zou returned and sensed the abnormality among the Wu tribe. Otherwise, if we'd only realized it later, it would have been too late. Now we finally understand why the top human forces have been leaving Pingbo Port these past few months.  We thought it was coincidence, but they'd already received warnings.”</p><p>Huiwen patted her chest in relief, her demeanor seemingly innocent and carefree.</p><p>Qin Sang, aware that cultivators of their level were far from ordinary, wasn't fooled by her appearance.  Turning to Ning Kun, she asked, "Your company originates from the East Pole Alliance. How did you not receive any prior notice?"</p><p>The more factions she interacted with in Pingbo Port, the more she learned about the East Pole Alliance—a powerful trading company whose influence within humanity rivaled even the top sects.</p><p>Qin Sang found it hard to believe the East Pole Alliance hadn't detected the Wu tribe's actions.</p><p>Ning Kun's face remained pale, and his voice was weak. “Our company focuses mainly on the East China Sea.  Our branch in Pingbo Port has weak roots. Recently, Elder Zou befriended the island lord of Duyan Island in the Stormy Demon Sea. Duyan Island is closer to the Wu tribe's Tianwu Island, so he decided to establish this route.  We didn't expect this to happen. As for the East Pole Alliance… it's not a unified body…”</p><p>He shook his head, his expression suggesting some unspoken difficulties.</p><p>Qin Sang had already learned that the human and Wu tribe's outposts in the Demon Sea weren't in the same location.</p><p>The Wu tribe occupied an island called Tianwu Island, while humans used a different island, Dahuang Island.  The two were far apart, requiring significant effort to establish contact.</p><p>Between Tianwu Island and Dahuang Island, human and Wu tribe experts jointly guarded several islands, forming a route and resisting the demons.</p><p>Cultivators entering the Demon Sea to hunt demons relied on these islands as bases.</p><p>The areas controlled by humans and the Wu tribe were tiny specks in the vast Demon Sea.</p><p>Except for Tianwu and Dahuang Islands, the security of the other islands couldn’t be guaranteed; attacks resulting in the destruction of islands and deaths of inhabitants frequently occurred.</p><p>However, Tianwu and Dahuang Islands had been established for a long time, with the surrounding demonic beasts largely cleared.  To obtain significant gains, one had to venture to other islands.</p><p>Judging by Ning Kun's tone, Duyan Island seemed to be one of the larger islands on the route. These large islands possessed formidable strength, often ruled by Yuan Ying masters.  Elder Zou's ability to befriend the island lord of Duyan Island spoke volumes.</p><p>Qin Sang considered this; joining the Qiongyu Trading Company might indeed be beneficial.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, then changed the subject. “Do you two have any thoughts on the Wu tribe’s recent actions? Could it be related to the Seven Killing Hall incident some time ago? I heard rumors in Pingbo Port; many large forces with Yuan Ying masters were involved.”</p><p>Her main concern was the Seven Killing Hall, but her inquiries in Pingbo Port yielded little. Learning that Ning Kun had recently arrived from the human realm, she steered the conversation toward him.</p><p>Ning Kun, unsuspecting, shook his head. “It shouldn't be related. The appearance of the ancient corpse in the Seven Killing Hall isn't a secret; it was widely circulated a while ago, and the details are clear.  Wu tribe experts cannot enter the Seven Killing Hall; it's a human secret realm, unrelated to the Wu tribe. Moreover, the Wu tribe’s activities reportedly began shortly after the Seven Killing Hall opened, but it wasn’t taken seriously before.”</p><p>Furthermore, even if there's a connection, the human turmoil has subsided. Why hasn't the Witch Clan's Yuan Ying ancestor appeared yet?”</p><p>“The turmoil has subsided?”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. “The ancient corpse from the sky has been found?”</p><p>“I think so,” Ning Kun said uncertainly. “Some say this corpse carries a precious treasure of the Seven Killing Hall. Those Yuan Ying ancestors would be envious, wouldn't they? If they hadn't found the corpse, they probably wouldn't have given up so easily. Oh, right! I heard that in order to find the corpse, the righteous and demonic paths had several clashes, almost triggering a large-scale war affecting many factions. Perhaps the high-ranking officials of both sides suppressed the turmoil to avoid internal strife within the human race, switching to a secret search.”</p><p>“Makes sense.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, finding Ning Kun's speculation somewhat reasonable.</p><p>In the Canglang Sea, although human forces dominate, pushing the Witch Clan to the Witch God Continent, the Witch Clan is not to be underestimated. They have numerous Yuan Ying ancestors, always watching intently.</p><p>Human unrest could be exploited by the Witch Clan.  The human high-ranking officials would never allow this.</p><p>He's still alive and well, and nobody has found him.</p><p>The Sky Tower is heavily restricted, shrouded in immortal clouds.</p><p>The scene in the crystal shows that the corpse appeared for a very short time. Several Yuan Ying ancestors closest to the Sky Tower rushed over, but the corpse disappeared before they could see his true identity.</p><p>Huiwen, having listened to their conversation, found it boring and interjected, “Friend Qingfeng, I don't seem to have met you before.  Why did Sister Ran Luo invite you to travel together? What's your relationship? Does she have secrets I don't know?”</p><p>Huiwen smiled playfully and winked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang thought this nun was rather unconventional; instead of “Poor Nun,” she called herself “This concubine.”</p><p>Ning Kun seemed to know the inside story. “Manager Ran highly regards Friend Qingfeng's skill in crafting magical tools. I also look forward to you becoming an overseas guest elder of the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce.”</p><p>“Crafting magical tools?”</p><p>Huiwen exclaimed, delighted. “Friend, you can craft magical treasures?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly. “Both of you overestimate me. My skills are questionable, even to Elder Zou. I only have some understanding of crafting magical artifacts, and I'm confident I'm slightly better than others.  However, due to insufficient cultivation, I haven't yet crafted a magical treasure.”</p>
