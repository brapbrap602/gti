<h1>Chapter 1202: Tremors</h1><p>"The mysterious person called for help, luring me here, but now there's no response. This means the mysterious person was either rescued or has already perished here. In any case, they’ve most likely vanished...</p><p>"Tan Hao made a move, but only his aura remains here, with no trace of an opponent. Could it be that he was guided by the mysterious person to break the seal?</p><p>"Chen Heng probably came as well, but he didn’t intervene to save anyone.</p><p>"Did the treasures stored in the grand hall by the Corpse Sect fall into Chen Heng’s hands? Otherwise, how would he know corpse refinement techniques? That guy likely took the treasures and fled without a second thought about saving anyone—what a crafty fellow."</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang immediately realized that the mysterious person was the one he had been searching for!</p><p>"If Tan Hao was moved to help the mysterious person escape, it means she must have had something to offer him in exchange. And Tan Hao, who has long since disregarded his own life, is solely focused on reviving Tan Jie. That condition alone would be enough to sway him! The question is, did Tan Hao succeed? And where have they gone now?"</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly stood up and began searching the water. Sure enough, he discovered traces of sharp metallic energy in other areas.</p><p>With the mysterious person’s guidance, Tan Hao was able to attack the seal from both inside and out.</p><p>Qin Sang, alone, could only follow the distribution pattern of the metallic energy, slowly unraveling the seal in hopes of finding the sealed space and uncovering some clues.</p><p>In the secret realm, undisturbed, Qin Sang and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly patiently analyzed the seal.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the seal was far more vast than Qin Sang had imagined. It was clear that no cultivator of the current era could possess such power. The mysterious person’s origins were becoming apparent—she likely hailed from the same era as Bai.</p><p>Days passed.</p><p>After more than ten days, Qin Sang finally began to make some progress.</p><p>On this day, he appeared beside the altar, surrounded by demonic banners. The Golden Sinking Sword flew out on its own, swimming through the water like a fish, seemingly aimless but actually prying open the nodes of the seal one by one.</p><p>As Qin Sang moved, the once-calm water surface began to churn with waves.</p><p>Underwater currents surged, bringing with them immense force.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his true essence to protect himself, ignoring his surroundings as he followed the Golden Sinking Sword. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly on his shoulder fluttered its wings gently.</p><p>As he and the sword moved, the chaos in the water grew increasingly violent. In some areas, the seal’s formations briefly manifested before vanishing, only to trigger disturbances in other parts of the water.</p><p>This place was like an ocean formed entirely of seals, its complexity unparalleled. Without the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and the traces left by Tan Hao’s earlier attempts to break the seal, Qin Sang would have no idea how long it would take to decipher.</p><p>Gradually, the seal began to reveal its secrets.</p><p>'Boom...'</p><p>Layer upon layer of waves shattered the tranquility of the space. At the exit, the fat chicken, seeing the scene below, grew nervous. It flapped its wings, lightning crackling, blocking the exit to prevent the disturbances from affecting the outside world.</p><p>Underwater, everything turned pitch black.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the chaotic forces in the water growing stronger. He surfaced, leaving only the Golden Sinking Sword behind.</p><p>The sword’s light flickered in the water, appearing and disappearing intermittently.</p><p>At that moment, a shadow inexplicably appeared on the altar. The unexpected change made Qin Sang’s gaze sharpen. He stared intently at the altar, but the Golden Sinking Sword continued its work without pause.</p><p>The shadow rapidly transformed, and the power of the seal began to converge toward it, gradually forming a vortex at the bottom of the water, connected to the very center of the altar!</p><p>The vortex appeared, leading to an unknown place.</p><p>Yet, the water level didn’t decrease, indicating that the vortex was a manifestation of the seal’s power.</p><p>Just as the vortex was about to fully form, Qin Sang’s expression shifted slightly, and he suddenly recalled the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>The vortex instantly dissipated, and the seal’s power scattered back into the water. The surface quickly returned to calm, as if nothing had happened, making one doubt whether it had all been an illusion.</p><p>"The interior of the vortex is impossible to probe. It doesn’t seem to be a simple spatial connection."</p><p>Qin Sang analyzed the images the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had just observed. "The vortex leads to the sealed space, but there’s no reaction from within. To confirm my suspicions and uncover the whereabouts of Tan Hao and the mysterious person, I’ll likely have to venture in myself. Entering an unknown space, it’s best to wait until the Ebony Sword finishes its devouring before taking action..."</p><p>Qin Sang had a hunch that the sealed space was far from simple.</p><p>The sword formation required the use of his lifebound spirit sword to unleash its full power, giving him an additional strategy in case of danger.</p><p>Moreover, once the lifebound spirit sword advanced to the level of a supreme treasure, the combination of thunder and sword techniques would greatly enhance his evasion abilities.</p><p>When he set out for the Sin Abyss, the Ebony Sword was nearly done with its devouring. It wouldn’t take much longer now.</p><p>The fat chicken was eager to try, but Qin Sang held it back. This wasn’t some ordinary secret realm—if they entered and faced danger head-on, there might not even be time to call for help.</p><p>Qin Sang was patient. He returned to the front of the grand hall, sitting cross-legged as he contemplated the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation while waiting for the Ebony Sword.</p><p>...</p><p>At the entrance to the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>This was the forbidden land of the Sin Abyss, the deepest part of the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>Yet, this wasn’t the end. On the ground, there was a massive, irregular void spanning thousands of feet, filled with endless mystery and true darkness, as if it could swallow even one’s gaze.</p><p>This was the entrance to the Abyssal Ruins, and within the ruins lay the Sin God Palace.</p><p>Around the void, the Sin Abyss had set up a grand formation.</p><p>One purpose was to prevent intruders from sneaking in.</p><p>The importance of the Abyssal Ruins and the Sin God Palace to the cultivators of the Sin Abyss was self-evident, especially during times of war, when they had to guard against sabotage from the Two Domains Alliance.</p><p>The other purpose was to prevent the power of the Abyssal Ruins from leaking out.</p><p>At the edge of the void sat a white-haired elder and a high-crowned Daoist. Judging by their auras, both were Nascent Soul Ancestors, personally guarding this place!</p><p>Around them, squads of guards patrolled back and forth, the defenses exceptionally tight.</p><p>The two Nascent Souls sat casually on the rocks beside the void, their eyes closed as they meditated.</p><p>Suddenly, an unusual fluctuation emanated from within the void.</p><p>Both Nascent Souls opened their eyes simultaneously, their gazes sharp as lightning as they stared into the void.</p><p>After a moment, they exchanged a glance. The white-haired elder said, "It must be the Sin God Palace. Calculating the time, it’s been half a year since the last tremor. It’s about time for another."</p><p>The high-crowned Daoist nodded. "This time, it seems the Sin God Palace and the Purple Palace are preparing to emerge earlier than usual. In the years leading up to their emergence, the tremors of the Sin God Palace will become increasingly frequent."</p><p>As they spoke, they flicked their fingers, sending streams of light into the formation surrounding the void. Moments later, bursts of strange light flashed, activating the formation, which then transformed into a thin barrier of light covering the void.</p><p>Soon, more fluctuations followed.</p><p>This continued for two days, during which some cultivators emerged from within.</p><p>"It’s coming! Have them come down."</p><p>The white-haired elder spoke gravely, taking out a delicate iron bell and shaking it. A melodious chime rang out.</p><p>The guards rushed over, gathering around the two Nascent Soul Ancestors. Feeling the increasingly chaotic fluctuations from the void, they waited for what was to come.</p>
