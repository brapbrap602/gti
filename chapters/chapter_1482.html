<h1>Chapter 1474: The Cleansing Pool (4k)</h1><p>*Clink!*</p><p>Liuli gently set down the jade cup.</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing something significant was about to be revealed, straightened his expression.</p><p>"Daoist Qin... have you heard of the Buddhist legend of the Cleansing Pool?" Liuli asked softly.</p><p>In the North Sea's cultivation world, Buddhism had declined, far from being comparable to the Daoist sects. Over the centuries of his cultivation, Qin Sang had encountered only a handful of Buddhist sects, with the Pure Sea Sect being the only notable one. However, even that sect had been wiped out, its lineage severed.</p><p>Yet, the legends surrounding Buddhism were numerous.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool was said to be a treasure of the Buddha himself. It was rumored that even a mortal with no cultivation base could enter the pool and emerge cleansed of all karmic burdens, achieving enlightenment and escaping the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p>The Daoist sects had similar legends, such as a mortal consuming a Nine Revolutions Golden Elixir and ascending to immortality in a single step.</p><p>Even among the myriad of fantastical tales, the Cleansing Pool and the Nine Revolutions Golden Elixir stood out as the most unbelievable, almost like the wild imaginings of mortals. Cultivators, however, did not indulge in such unrealistic fantasies.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard bits and pieces of these legends but had never paid them much attention.</p><p>He nodded slightly and smiled, "Are you telling me that such divine artifacts truly exist in this world?"</p><p>Even if the Cleansing Pool did exist, it would likely be found only in the realms of immortals or the Buddha's paradise.</p><p>Liuli, however, did not answer directly. Instead, she turned to Shixue, as if seeking her approval.</p><p>Shixue cleared her throat and addressed Qin Sang, "Daoist Qin, as a guest elder recognized by both myself and Hall Master Jiang, revealing this secret to you does not violate our rules. However, before we proceed, you must swear a heart demon oath that the contents of our conversation will never be disclosed to a fourth person."</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned, finding this request somewhat incredulous.</p><p>Could it be that the Profound Heaven Palace truly possessed the Cleansing Pool?</p><p>What puzzled Qin Sang even more was why Shixue and Liuli were revealing this to him.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang swiftly swore the heart demon oath, vowing never to divulge the secret.</p><p>Shixue nodded to Liuli, who then turned back to Qin Sang and continued, "This secret is known in its entirety only to the four main branches of our sect. Within the sacred grounds of the Profound Heaven Palace lies a Cleansing Pool, though its efficacy cannot compare to the Buddhist holy artifact. However, if a cultivator enters the pool, it can enhance their ability to absorb spiritual energy in the future, effectively improving their innate talent. This effect is even noticeable for those with heavenly spiritual roots. According to our predecessors, the weaker one's spiritual roots, the greater the potential improvement."</p><p>Liuli emphasized the last sentence.</p><p>Back at Mount Shaohua, she had thoroughly investigated Qin Sang and knew he was born with five spiritual roots, the worst possible talent for a cultivator. Such individuals were least likely to achieve anything in the path of immortality, which was why he had resorted to selling himself to reach the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>However, it was unclear what fortuitous encounters Qin Sang had experienced later, as he had managed to reach his current level with only a fragmented soul-splitting cultivation technique. This was the greatest mystery Liuli had about Qin Sang since their reunion.</p><p>Shixue leaned back in her chair, sipping her tea, waiting to see Qin Sang's reaction.</p><p>Liuli had not disclosed Qin Sang's background to her. Shixue assumed Qin Sang's talent was at least that of a heavenly spiritual root, or perhaps dual spiritual roots.</p><p>However, no matter how talented one was, the allure of the Cleansing Pool was irresistible. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><p>Enhancing one's cultivation speed, even if it only saved a year of arduous training, meant a greater chance of breaking through bottlenecks and reaching higher realms.</p><p>Shixue could hardly imagine anyone refusing such a temptation, except perhaps someone as stubborn as her junior sister.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>As Shixue had anticipated, even someone as composed as Qin Sang was taken aback by Liuli's revelation, finding it hard to believe.</p><p>After centuries of cultivation, Qin Sang had repeatedly witnessed the harsh realities of the cultivation world.</p><p>Lacking talent meant facing endless obstacles, requiring every possible effort to overcome them.</p><p>Methods to improve one's innate talent after birth were exceedingly rare. The only one Qin Sang knew of was the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture," which had been instrumental in his current achievements.</p><p>Even if the Cleansing Pool only enhanced the speed of absorbing spiritual energy without truly improving one's innate talent, it was still a treasure coveted by all cultivators.</p><p>With the Profound Heaven Palace monopolizing the Cleansing Pool, it was no wonder the sect had flourished for so long, producing numerous powerful cultivators.</p><p>With his life-bound spirit sword engraved with killing runes, Qin Sang's cultivation speed already surpassed that of dual spiritual root cultivators. If he could gain access to the Cleansing Pool, he might one day catch up to or even surpass Liuli.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was not one to be swayed by fantasies.</p><p>He never believed in free lunches and quickly suppressed his excitement. His gaze swept over Shixue and Liuli's faces as he pondered for a moment before asking, "What is the meaning behind you two revealing this secret to me? Surely the Profound Heaven Palace wouldn't grant access to the Cleansing Pool to an outsider like me, a guest elder?"</p><p>Shixue, noticing how quickly Qin Sang regained his composure, showed a hint of surprise and explained on Liuli's behalf.</p><p>"Only when the sacred grounds are opened can one enter the Cleansing Pool. The pool is surrounded by powerful restrictions that have been in place for an unknown period. Each time, only one person has the opportunity to enter, and sometimes, this opportunity must be fought for. If no one enters within the allotted time, the pool will close on its own. Additionally, to prevent the opportunity from being wasted on the unworthy, there is an ironclad rule..."</p><p>At this point, Shixue showed a look of frustration and continued, "Only Nascent Soul cultivators who have broken through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage within three hundred years of forming their Nascent Soul, before the first heavenly tribulation, are eligible to enter the Cleansing Pool."</p><p>This restriction eliminated the hopes of the vast majority of Profound Heaven Palace cultivators, including Shixue herself.</p><p>She had already undergone her first heavenly tribulation but remained stuck at the early Nascent Soul stage, making her one of the "unworthy."</p><p>Shixue's concern for Liuli, which had led her to seek the "Divine Maiden's Heart Scripture" from the Luo family, was partly motivated by the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>Liuli's talent was exceptional. If not for her emotional struggles, she would have undoubtedly broken through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage before her first heavenly tribulation, securing her place in the Cleansing Pool with her formidable Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>In the future, Liuli might even succeed the Grand Elder and revitalize the Listening Snow Pavilion.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool was likely a legacy left by the founder of the Profound Heaven Palace to ensure the sect's enduring prosperity. Unfortunately, due to internal strife and the loss of ancient texts, it was no longer clear which ancestor had left this treasure.</p><p>Throughout the history of the Profound Heaven Palace, most of those who ascended to the positions of Grand Elder and Palace Master had emerged from the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>While their innate talents were undoubtedly exceptional, the role of the Cleansing Pool in their success could not be overlooked, serving as the icing on the cake.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang instinctively glanced at Liuli, suddenly understanding many things.</p><p>Calculating the time, Liuli's first heavenly tribulation was approaching, which explained Shixue's concern.</p><p>Her last attempt to break through had been her final opportunity, but it had ended in failure.</p><p>However, if both of them agreed to cultivate the "Divine Maiden's Heart Scripture," Liuli could use dual cultivation to dispel the demonic imprint and seize the chance to break through.</p><p>Yet, Liuli had not hesitated at all, choosing to miss this great opportunity rather than submit to the demonic imprint.</p><p>Qin Sang observed her closely but found no trace of regret in her expression.</p><p>Truly, those with great talent could afford to be willful.</p><p>"This condition is indeed quite stringent. Even your four main branches cannot guarantee that a cultivator who breaks through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage before the first tribulation will always appear, right?"</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze from Liuli and continued to question Shixue.</p><p>The current state of the Listening Snow Pavilion was a prime exampleâ€”even main branches could decline.</p><p>"Correct," Shixue admitted frankly.</p><p>"Whenever a disciple with exceptional talent emerges, all four branches will spare no effort in nurturing them. Even so, it is difficult to ensure that someone will always be available to compete for the Cleansing Pool. However, the pool opens roughly once every three hundred years. Aside from those who have already entered the pool, those who failed to secure a spot in the previous attempt can continue to compete before their second heavenly tribulation.</p><p>"Additionally, we have tried various methods.</p><p>"For instance, when a branch produces a prodigy, we absorb them into the main branch, or even merge the branch into the main branch, though this is quite troublesome. Others resort to unorthodox methods, even forbidden demonic techniques, to forcibly elevate their cultivation, even if only temporarily.</p><p>"Even if it leaves some lingering issues, gaining access to the Cleansing Pool is worth it."</p><p>As she spoke, Shixue couldn't help but glance at Liuli.</p><p>Her efforts to obtain the "Divine Maiden's Secret Scripture" for Liuli had been motivated by this very thought.</p><p>Unfortunately, Liuli had refused.</p><p>As Qin Sang listened to Shixue's explanation, his mind raced.</p><p>Shixue and Liuli would not have revealed these secrets to him without a reason.</p><p>He indeed met the requirements, and Qin Sang was confident that as long as he could enter the sacred grounds, unless Palace Master Tong Lingyu or the Grand Elder personally intervened, the opportunity to enter the Cleansing Pool would undoubtedly be his.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, his eyes flickering as he began to grasp the situation. He gave Liuli a meaningful look and said, "Unfortunately, I am not from the main branch, nor am I from a branch. I am an outsider."</p><p>The term "guest elder" existed for a reason.</p><p>Guest elders were not burdened with the responsibility of continuing the sect's legacy.</p><p>Correspondingly, they were also not privy to the sect's true secrets.</p><p>Would the Profound Heaven Palace really grant such an opportunity to an outsider?</p><p>Shixue opened her mouth to explain, but before she could speak, Liuli, who had been silent until now, interjected, "When the four branches first reconciled, a resolution was made. Outsiders who sincerely join the Profound Heaven Palace can be treated equally, but they must have a compelling reason and a deep enough connection to ensure they will not betray the sect."</p><p>She paused briefly before adding in a serious tone, "For example, a marriage alliance!"</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond, Shixue chimed in, "The Profound Heaven Palace occupies an entire realm and has never lacked geniuses. Such situations are rare but not unheard of. However, these cultivators, like those who have competed multiple times, face certain restrictions. When Profound Heaven Palace cultivators compete for the first time, the difficulty of the restriction trials is reduced by one level. But these outsiders must pass the full trial, and only those with exceptional strength have a chanceâ€”like you, Daoist Qin."</p><p>As she spoke, Shixue kept her eyes on Qin Sang, her tone relaxed.</p><p>Having personally witnessed Qin Sang's abilities, she knew better than anyone how formidable he was. If Qin Sang was willing to participate, victory was almost certain.</p><p>"I'm a bit confused. Are you two suggesting that I form a marriage alliance with a fellow cultivator from the Listening Snow Pavilion?" Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>"With me," Liuli stepped forward unexpectedly, "and no one else."</p><p>Shixue looked helpless. "Within the Listening Snow Pavilion, only my junior sister, myself, and another senior sister meet the requirements in terms of status and cultivation level to convince the Palace Master and the other three branches... My junior sister doesn't want to involve us."</p><p>With that, Shixue suddenly stood up. "I just remembered there's an important matter I nearly forgot. Junior sister, you stay and discuss this with Daoist Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang watched Shixue's hurried departure with a wry smile.</p><p>Only after she was gone did he turn back to Liuli and sigh. "I must admit, the Cleansing Pool is quite tempting. However, if this is merely a facade, I doubt it would fool the Palace Master and the elders, would it?"</p><p>This was clearly different from his previous transaction to reach Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Back then, it had been a straightforward deal, with no lingering obligations. If not for the series of unexpected events, they would have gone their separate ways long ago.</p><p>This time, forming a genuine Daoist partnership with Liuli would create many entanglements.</p><p>If it were mutual, that would be one thing.</p><p>But while Qin Sang and Liuli had known each other for centuries and shared a complicated history, there was no genuine affection between them. Liuli was trapped by the demonic imprint, and her feelings for him were fabricated.</p><p>Liuli had firmly rejected dual cultivation but now proposed a marriage alliance, offering an irresistible gift. It all seemed rather peculiar.</p><p>Liuli's gaze lowered slightly, and she bit her lip lightly before speaking in her usual cool tone, "We have cultivated the 'Mystic Yin Jade Cauldron Scripture.'"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>The imprint still existed, creating a unique connection between him and Liuli that others did not share.</p><p>If they could use this to deceive the heavens, it would simplify matters.</p><p>"I do not accept rewards without merit. Surely, you have additional conditions for me? What must I do to earn this opportunity?"</p><p>Hearing this, Liuli was not surprised.</p><p>Given Qin Sang's intelligence, it would be strange if he hadn't guessed as much.</p><p>"After you enter the Cleansing Pool, help me retrieve a treasure from the bottom of the pool."</p><p>"A treasure from the Cleansing Pool?"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately sensed the danger and asked solemnly, "Will retrieving this item cause any anomalies in the pool or alert the Palace Master and the Grand Elder?"</p><p>A treasure from such a sacred place was no ordinary matter.</p><p>If the Profound Heaven Palace discovered it, it could lead to a deadly confrontation.</p><p>Liuli explained carefully, "This item was discovered by my master when she entered the Cleansing Pool. It's unlikely that anyone else knows of its existence. My master attempted to retrieve it but lacked the strength. The restrictions at the bottom of the pool are extremely dangerous. However, my master had nearly succeeded in moving the item, and the pool showed no reaction. Unless one possesses extraordinary strength, only the Ice Soul Divine Light can retrieve it. This is part of the reason I cultivated the Ice Soul Divine Light. With your strength far surpassing your peers, you have a good chance. When the time comes, I will condense a strand of Ice Soul Divine Light into a talisman, though its power will inevitably diminish and may not be fully effective."</p><p>A hint of complexity flashed in Liuli's eyes.</p><p>Cultivating the Ice Soul Divine Light had been a multifaceted endeavor.</p><p>Even with a treasure inferior to the Yin Li Pearl, Liuli had a more than fifty percent chance of breaking through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>But all her plans had been disrupted upon reuniting with Qin Sang.</p><p>The influence of the demonic technique was more terrifying than she had imagined. Facing Qin Sang directly had caused the imprint to react violently, and her Ice Soul Sealing Emotion technique had failed, leading directly to her breakthrough failure.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>Liuli's clear demand actually put him at ease. He could adapt as needed, and taking some risks for the Cleansing Pool was worth it.</p><p>Having made up his mind, Qin Sang inquired about the restrictions surrounding the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>Liuli handed him a jade slip. "Everything is recorded here."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, accepting the jade slip, signaling his agreement to the plan.</p><p>"What do I need to do next?"</p><p>"Hold a grand wedding," Liuli said after a pause, "a fake one."</p>
