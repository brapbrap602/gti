<h1>Chapter 1613: The Sword Tomb</h1><p>As they spoke,</p><p>the Murky Heaven Formation enveloped Dragon Soaring Cliff, its black curtain expanding outward.</p><p>Su Zinan and the others felt a resonance, falling silent and looking up at the sky, intently observing the formation's changes.</p><p>With their keen eyesight, they could clearly see that the Murky Heaven Formation wasn't simply sealing off Mount Tai Sect; it was actively disrupting its protective mountain formation.</p><p>From the outside, the Murky Heaven Formation seemed to penetrate everything, embedding itself within Mount Tai Sect's protective array.</p><p>The two spiritual formations nearly overlapped, the dark curtain clearly spreading within the protective array.</p><p>These two radically different formations, normally incompatible, were now perfectly integrated, indistinguishable from one another.</p><p>Key nodes of Mount Tai Sect's protective formation were either invaded, obscured, or destroyed by the Murky Heaven Formation, greatly weakening its power.</p><p>This demonstrated the incredible sophistication of the Murky Heaven Formation.</p><p>Su Zinan, as a successor of a Nascent Divinity cultivator, possessed unmatched insight among those present.  Because of this, he was all the more aware of the immense difficulty involved.</p><p>A strange look flashed across his eyes. He secretly used his divine abilities to mentally simulate the formation's next moves, but even with the previous clues, he found it incredibly strenuous.</p><p>Looking at the white-haired elder in surprise, Su Zinan’s internal estimation of him rose significantly.</p><p>He wondered how long the white-haired elder had been plotting against Mount Tai Sect, possessing such intimate knowledge of its protective formation. Even for a master of formations, achieving this level of mastery would require immense effort, almost impossible to accomplish.</p><p>Furthermore, sealing Mount Tai Sect was only the initial preparatory stage, not even the first step. They hadn't even seen a trace of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect yet.</p><p>No single person, or even a large power, could do this!</p><p>Unless the plot had begun long ago, cultivated over generations, gradually achieving its goal.</p><p>This was characteristic of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's successors.</p><p>"By my foster father's standards, your mastery of formations is truly remarkable. I am truly impressed,"</p><p>Su Zinan maintained a refined demeanor in public, never using his status as a Nascent Divinity successor to bully others. He readily admitted his mistakes and readily praised those more skilled.</p><p>No one could guess his brutal nature.</p><p>"Unbelievable! Besides Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan, Heaven Soaring Pavilion actually hides such a master. The Qu Yang Mountain branch of Heaven Soaring Pavilion is inconspicuous. Your hiding here is a waste of your talent. In my opinion, your abilities are enough to replace either of them. If I hadn't been with my foster father and interacted with Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan, I would have thought one of them was disguising themselves to make fun of me."</p><p>The white-haired elder's subordinates all wore long robes to conceal their identities, but their true nature was revealed once they clashed with Mount Tai Sect. Su Zinan and the others, with their sharp eyes, finally saw through his origins.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man clearly knew the white-haired elder's identity beforehand, while others were surprised at his formidable background, hailing from the number one sect of the Demon Path.</p><p>The white-haired elder controlled the Murky Heaven Formation with ease, even having the leisure to respond, "Su Daoist flatters. Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan possess profound demonic arts and will soon reach Nascent Divinity.  I can only painstakingly uncover the ruins of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect to seek opportunities. The difference in our abilities is clear."</p><p>These words subtly indicated that he wasn't aligned with Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan.</p><p>Everyone understood.</p><p>Heaven Soaring Pavilion was not a monolithic entity; the hearts of demonic cultivators were unpredictable, with internal conflicts far exceeding those of other sects.</p><p>If this person had colluded with Yu and Fan, adding him to their numbers, Heaven Soaring Pavilion could easily open the Wuxiang Immortal Sect with just a few allies; they wouldn’t need such elaborate measures.</p><p>The Daoist and Buddhist sects weren't the only ones targeting the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. The Demon Path had also reaped substantial benefits back then, and Heaven Soaring Pavilion showed no mercy towards the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Preventing the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's resurgence seemed to be a consensus among the major sects of the Central Plains, otherwise, traces of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect would not have been erased so thoroughly.</p><p>The remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect had infiltrated Heaven Soaring Pavilion, forming their own branch.  The most dangerous place is indeed the safest, proving the wisdom of the ancients.</p><p>During the group's discussion, the sword-carrying man remained silent.</p><p>After a light cough, the sword-carrying man said solemnly, “To my knowledge, the sect master of the Qu Yang Mountain branch is only at the mid-Yuan Ying stage. Judging by your abilities, you haven't achieved this recently. Have you been secretly hiding behind the scenes all this time?"</p><p>"I am Zhu Wu Dao, the sect master of Qu Yang Mountain," the white-haired elder nodded.</p><p>The sword-carrying man was astonished. "You've been hiding for so long under the noses of Yu and Fan?"</p><p>"My master left me a few little tricks, nothing worth mentioning," Zhu Wu Dao replied nonchalantly, offering no further explanation.</p><p>After a moment, Zhu Wu Dao withdrew his control, allowing the formation to evolve on its own. After sensing the outside, he let out a long sigh, "Daoist Mo and the others have personally taken action; there should be no worries! The situation is settled; we should begin."</p><p>Pausing, Zhu Wu Dao remembered something and looked at the grotesque-faced man, "Where is the Poison King now?"</p><p>The grotesque-faced man made a calculation with his fingers. "The Cave Master and I set up a deceptive formation outside. If nothing goes wrong, he should have been lured to the heartland of Manzhou."</p><p>"That's good. The Poison King alone can't stir up much trouble!"</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao nodded.  "As long as we can draw the Poison King away for a while, even if the Wuxiang Immortal Sect appears and brings him here, by the time the news reaches Jinyuzhou it will be too late. We have plenty of time."</p><p>...</p><p>As they spoke, the sounds of battle outside Tenglong Cliff grew deafening.</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>...</p><p>The sound of drums suddenly echoed from within Taiyue Gate.</p><p>Each drumbeat was faster than the last.  These weren't ordinary drums; they seemed to originate from the earth itself, commanding the myriad mountains to move.  The drumbeats were deep and resonant, not shrill, yet those who heard them clearly felt the urgency they conveyed, their minds shaken, a sense of suffocation gripping them.</p><p>With each drumbeat, panic spread through Taiyue Gate.</p><p>This was the Taiyue sacrificial drum, built atop the main peak, personally constructed by Taiyue Gate's founding ancestor. It wasn't a magical treasure, but its significance to Taiyue Gate was immense.</p><p>The Taiyue sacrificial drum was only struck in the direst of emergencies. Since Taiyue Gate rose to become the dominant force in the Southern Province, the sound of the drums hadn't been heard for countless years.</p><p>Upon entering Taiyue Gate, disciples were informed of the existence of the sacrificial drum, but none had ever heard it sound.</p><p>The moment the drum sounded, regardless of their cultivation level or the reason, everyone in Taiyue Gate immediately converged on the main peak.</p><p>To make matters worse, night fell without warning.</p><p>From the depths of the darkness, it seemed as if a hundred ghosts were roaming, increasing the terror of the Taiyue Gate disciples.</p><p>They knew something had happened to their sect, but they never imagined the calamity would originate from within. Had their protective formation become nothing more than a display?</p><p>For a time, Taiyue Gate was in chaos.  Streams of escaping light flashed out in all directions, heading towards the main peak.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, these fleeing disciples only made themselves easier targets.</p><p>The lower-level disciples of Taiyue Gate were no match for the invaders.  Slaughter ensued; beams of light extinguished one after another, only the occasional short, sharp scream breaking the silence.  Most, like the gate guards, died silently.</p><p>The invaders, having slaughtered the low-level disciples, found it unsatisfying and turned their attention to Taiyue Gate's main peak. The Taiyue Gate experts reacted swiftly, most already gathering on the main peak and activating the protective array.</p><p>At this moment, the Mutian Xuan Array covered the main peak of Taiyue Gate, but the darkness couldn't swallow the peak entirely; a Xuanhuang light flickered there.  The Mutian Xuan Array could only break the protective formation around the mountain; the main peak had its own independent array.</p><p>However, the Mutian Xuan Array's sealing power was impartial.</p><p>The main peak's array was also enveloped by darkness; the yellow light appeared weak and dim. The strange phenomenon here was invisible to outsiders, let alone able to transmit any messages.</p><p>"Old Chi, where are you going!"</p><p>Suddenly, two beams of light, one red and one white, appeared from the darkness.</p><p>The white light led, the red trailing behind.</p><p>The red light belonged to the Qiling Cave Master. After a search yielding little, he had assumed that all the Taiyue Gate experts had fled to the main peak, only to unexpectedly discover a sneaky individual.</p><p>Even better, this person had a grudge against him!</p><p>The white light revealed a burly man with a ruddy complexion.  Seeing the Qiling Cave Master, his eyes widened in fury: "It's you!"</p><p>The Qiling Cave Master sneered, "Back then, you all shouted about leveling my Qiling Cave, driving the Cave Master out of the Southern Province. Did you ever think this day would come?"</p><p>Before he could finish, the Qiling Cave Master shot a red light from his palm.</p><p>The red light was strikingly vibrant, a red flower, resembling a trumpet flower, hanging upside down in the air, its opening facing Old Chi.</p><p>'Wuuu…'</p><p>A strange whistling sound came from the flower's center, the red light flickering.</p><p>There was no overwhelming attack.</p><p>But the moment the whistling sound began, Old Chi reacted as if facing a mortal enemy, instantly throwing himself to the ground.  With a 'boom,' he crashed into the hard mountainside, creating a large crater.</p><p>Then, a yellow light flashed from Old Chi, and he merged with the rock, instantly disappearing underground.  Simultaneously, the crater's center swelled, exceeding its original height, forming a distinct bulge.</p><p>The texture of the bulge was distinctly different from the surrounding mountainside; it had regular patterns, like a shield carved from stone.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>A series of explosions rang out; the bulge's surface instantly cracked with a dozen knife-like cuts. Only then did a few fleeting illusory blade shadows appear.</p><p>The bulge collapsed.</p><p>A muffled groan came from within.</p><p>Seeing that he hadn't forced Old Chi out, the Qiling Cave Master changed his incantation. The red flower suddenly swelled, growing as large as a small mountain, like a giant bell, and descended heavily towards the direction Old Chi had fled.</p><p>Unexpectedly,</p><p>Just as the red flower was about to land, the ground cracked open, black light shot up into the sky, and a stone stele flew out from the earth.</p><p>The stele was square and unremarkable, bearing only two characters: "Dingfeng."</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>A deafening roar.  Hong Hua and the Dingfeng Stele, one descending, the other ascending, collided violently.  A blinding red light erupted, staining half the sky.</p><p>The Dingfeng Stele's impact was less noticeable in the darkness.</p><p>But Hong Hua faltered, its descent arrested.</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu, the Cave Master of Qi Ling, was taken aback by this unexpected intrusion. His expression changed, but any attempt at rectification was too late.</p><p>*WHOOSH!*</p><p>The stele shot into the air, towards the main peak.</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu hesitated, then abandoned the pursuit, his gaze turning coldly towards the Tai Yue Men main peak.  Within the yellow glow of the protective formation, several figures flickered.</p><p>They were attempting a rescue.</p><p>At that moment, a figure materialized beside Qi Ling Dongzhu.</p><p>"Daoist Mo, you were too slow," Qi Ling Dongzhu said with dissatisfaction.</p><p>The newcomer was Mo Xingdao.  Had he acted without hesitation, he could have stopped the old ghost, Lao Chi.</p><p>Indecisive. How could he be the North Waste's foremost hermit cultivator?</p><p>"You're injured?" Mo Xingdao asked, ignoring the rebuke.</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu, surprised by Mo Xingdao's perceptiveness, reluctantly nodded.  "The Poison King set a trap."</p><p>"The Poison King?" Mo Xingdao exclaimed, but seeing Qi Ling Dongzhu's reluctance to elaborate, he didn't press further, instead following his gaze to the main peak. "I need to prevent others from breaking through."</p><p>This served as an explanation for his earlier inaction.  Their goal wasn't to hunt down Tai Yue Men's masters, but to ensure no news leaked and to keep Tai Yue Men confined to the main peak.</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu grudgingly accepted this explanation.</p><p>On the main peak, Tai Yue Men disciples were in despair.</p><p>Those who had managed to escape to the main peak wore no smiles; many of their friends and relatives had been slaughtered, others falling into the clutches of demons, doomed for eternity.</p><p>The Yuan Ying stage cultivators guarding the mountain gathered, maintaining the protective formation – their last defense.</p><p>These cultivators were centered around an elderly man with a deeply wrinkled face.</p><p>Anger was secondary; they had to find a way to break out.</p><p>Then, a figure arrived, panicked. "Grand Elder! The communication formation is down!  Someone tampered with it inside the mountain gate!"</p><p>The elder was Tai Yue Men's current Grand Elder, his cultivation at the peak of the mid-Yuan Ying stage.  Though further advancement was impossible, his spiritual sense was at the level of manifestation, making him a prominent figure in the cultivation world.</p><p>This news caused an uproar.</p><p>Grand Elder's expression remained impassive. His voice, though soft, reached everyone clearly. "Remain calm. In this chaos, I've already alerted the Sect Master.  We need only defend the main peak and wait for reinforcements. We will retaliate and avenge our kin!"</p><p>His words calmed the troops.</p><p>The disciples' panic subsided.</p><p>The Grand Elder's eyes were half-closed, appearing almost asleep, like an ordinary old man.</p><p>No one noticed that his gaze pierced through the protective formation, towards the hellish scene outside the main peak.</p><p>Those Tai Yue Men disciples, moments ago vibrant lives.</p><p>His expression wasn't truly emotionless.  Though he'd sent away the most promising disciples under various pretexts, witnessing this needless slaughter still caused him pain.</p><p>These disciples never imagined they had been abandoned by their revered Grand Elder and Sect Master, discarded pawns of the sect!</p><p>This plan had started when the target was identified as remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Though the mastermind behind the plan was Zi Lei Zhenren, the Grandmaster of the Eight Scenery Sect, both he and Yue Lingtian had no reason to refuse, agreeing without hesitation.</p><p>For after this, Tai Yue Men would gain entry to the South Sea Immortal Palace!</p><p>The Eight Scenery Sect and the Ganlu Chan Monastery thrived thanks to a hidden realm within the South Sea Immortal Palace.</p><p>Both sects possessed Nascent Soul cultivators, jointly controlling the South Sea Immortal Palace, excluding outsiders. Each generation of great cultivators could enter the palace, improving their chances of breakthrough.</p><p>Entry to the South Sea Immortal Palace was solely determined by these two sects.</p><p>Rumors were true: Tai Yue Men's rise to dominance in the South was due to the Eight Scenery Sect's support.</p><p>Even so, the Eight Scenery Sect wasn't generous enough to offer a place.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren had promised that upon the next opening of the South Sea Immortal Palace, the Eight Scenery Sect would give Tai Yue Men a spot!</p><p>Who could refuse such an offer?</p>
