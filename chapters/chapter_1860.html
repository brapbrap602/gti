Chapter 1851: Imperial Decree


How could the Demon King enter the Governance Altar?
Moreover, there was no sign of any celestial phenomenon surrounding him.
Powerful as he was, there remained a significant gap between him and a true Void Refinement realm expert. Qin Sang had been hunted by Demon Kings before and experienced their terrifying might.
Qin Sang's first thought was to temporarily suppress his cultivation base using a secret technique. However, if doing so was enough to conceal celestial phenomena and enter the Governance Altar, it would be far too simple. Void Refinement experts wouldn't need to worry about celestial phenomena at all.
Could it be self-severing?
Qin Sang couldn't be certain. The Dao Court and the Ghostfang Kingdom possessed unfathomable foundations and certainly had many methods he was unaware of.
However, based on Qin Sang's understanding of the Illusory Realm, one thing was certain: Void Refinement experts wouldn't dare unleash their full power within the Governance Altar. Once celestial phenomena manifested, it would inevitably trigger the Illusory Realm's instability, and the one who caused the chaos would bear the brunt of the consequences.
If it was merely temporary suppression, there might be a chance to unleash full power for a single devastating blow. The consequence would be forced expulsion from the Governance Altar, or even severe injury. It was unlikely they would resort to such measures against him for the sake of a mere Demon Marquis.
These thoughts flashed through his mind like lightning. Qin Sang wasn't deterred by the mention of a Demon King. His eyes flashed with a sharp glint, and his speed, instead of decreasing, actually increased. In an instant, he closed the distance to Marquis Gui.
The final barrier before Marquis Gui couldn't even withstand a single breath against the Great Vajra Wheel Seal and the Palm-Heart Sword. It shattered in an instant under Marquis Gui's despairing gaze.
‘Whoosh!’
A gigantic palm shadow enveloped Marquis Gui, carrying the momentum of collapsing mountains.
“Audacious!”
Demon King Lingyou snorted coldly.
He employed his divine ability, traversing the water. Unexpectedly, his escape speed was inferior to this nameless individual. By the time he arrived, he witnessed this scene and found himself momentarily unable to intervene.
Qin Sang turned a deaf ear to the snort. His palm slammed down mercilessly. Having exhausted all his means, Marquis Gui couldn't evade. He let out a shrill, miserable cry, blood splattering across the sky.
Marquis Gui bore the full brunt of the palm strike, feeling as if his limbs and bones were shattered into dust by the terrifying force. In an instant, his internal organs were displaced, and he was grievously wounded.
The next moment, Marquis Gui felt a tightness around his neck, gripped firmly by a palm. Seeing stars, he seemed to glimpse the illusory image of a Buddhist seal.
An insurmountable force erupted. Marquis Gui's eyes bulged, and he could even hear the sound of his own spine cracking.
“Gasp…”
Marquis Gui’s eyes were bloodshot as he struggled frantically.
Seeing this, Demon King Lingyou laughed in fury. The black, ethereal waves beneath his feet ceased their advance and spread upwards at an astonishing speed, like a surging river.
‘Rumble…'
The roar of the waves was deafening.
A colossal wave suddenly surged from within the black, ethereal waves. Within the spray, a strange shadow could faintly be seen leaping out of the water from behind Demon King Lingyou.
Within the wave, the strange shadow revealed itself. A black fish head emerged from above Demon King Lingyou's head.
The fish head resembled that of a mundane blackfish, filled with sharp teeth. Its ethereal eyes stared fixedly at Qin Sang, who was wreaking havoc, brimming with ferocious intent.
However, the blackfish's body wasn't that of a fish. Its form was long and slender, akin to a Flood Dragon. Its black scales were identical to a Flood Dragon's, but three-clawed talons grew from its fins. It was clearly a fish demon that had yet to fully transform into a dragon!
‘Splash…’
The ethereal waves continued to rise, submerging Demon King Lingyou, leaving only the blackfish swimming within.
‘Gurgle…’
Strange sounds emanated from the blackfish’s body. Its long tail swung abruptly, drawing in the black, ethereal waves and surging forth like a bursting dam.
This blackfish was Demon King Lingyou's Dharma Idol.
Even a self-severed Demon King wouldn't completely sever their Dharma Idol. In the application and comprehension of the Dharma Idol, a Demon Marquis was far inferior.
This alone was sufficient to suppress a Demon Marquis.
‘Boom!’
Qin Sang suddenly felt his vision darken. Black water appeared from all directions, creating a terrifying scene of an imminent deluge.
Behind him, a river seemed to be rushing forth, accompanied by the celestial might of the Dharma Idol, bringing an overwhelming sense of oppression.
At this moment, Qin Sang felt like he had fallen into a whirlpool in the heart of a river, about to be crushed.
Qin Sang immediately understood what he was facing: a Demon King's Dharma Idol!
While startled, Qin Sang also breathed a sigh of relief. The Dharma Idol's celestial might was terrifying, but compared to the true Demon King Dharma Idol that had hunted him down in the past, there was a clear difference!
As expected, the Demon King was greatly restricted within the Governance Altar.
'Splash, splash, splash...'
The roar of waves filled his ears, and the pressure from behind grew closer and closer.
Qin Sang quickly assessed the power of the Demon King's Dharma Idol. Summoning his Azure Phoenix Dharma Idol, he should be able to counter the Dharma Idol's celestial might, either negating its suppression or limiting its effect.
However, he could only integrate the Azure Phoenix Dharma Idol into his body, passively utilizing its power. In terms of Dharma Idol application, he was far inferior.
If this was the extent of the Demon King's abilities, Qin Sang wouldn't be too apprehensive.
But this was clearly impossible. No matter how confident Qin Sang was, he didn't believe he could overpower a Demon King.
Qin Sang didn't turn back. He tightened his grip, merging the power of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal and a portion of the Azure Phoenix Dharma Idol.
Crack!
Bones shattered.
Marquis Gui's struggles ceased, his eyes turning ashen. Qin Sang's body flickered. The power of his Dharma Idol perfectly broke through the suppression of the celestial might, and he charged out just before the water waves converged.
In an instant, the sound of water vanished, and the surrounding waves momentarily froze.
The blackfish's gaze also solidified, its mouth wide open, spewing a stream of black water, but it was too late.
Qin Sang recalled the Cloud Wanderer Sword. With a powerful flap of his phoenix wings, he transformed into a bolt of lightning, cleaving through the waves. After a few flickers, he vanished from the demons' sight.
The blackfish stared in the direction Qin Sang had fled, abandoning the pursuit. It floated on the surface of the ethereal waves, its Flood Dragon tail swaying continuously.
Marquis Dingxiang arrived late, while Marquis Ping had narrowly escaped, still shaken.
The two demons looked at the blackfish, not daring to speak.
Other Demon Marquises also sensed the commotion here and gradually converged.
Amidst the splashing sounds, the waves receded, and the blackfish vanished, revealing Demon King Lingyou. A hint of anger flashed through his deep, black eyes.
"Was that a Dharma Idol?"
Marquis Dingxiang stepped forward and asked in a low voice.
Demon King Lingyou's expression was unreadable. He gave a faint "Mm" and added, "He doesn't have the aura of a Grand True Man."
The demonic soldiers of the Dao Court cultivated within the Governance Altar and inevitably carried traces of their master's aura. While indiscernible to ordinary individuals, it was clearly visible to Demon King Lingyou.
The absence of a Grand True Man's aura indicated that he wasn't part of a Grand True Man's forces.
If he were a Dao soldier nurtured by the Dao Court, he should also bear the Dao Court's talismanic decree.
Marquis Dingxiang wore an incredulous expression. "Could he be a hidden sage from the wilderness? Or perhaps a Demon King who has pledged allegiance to the Dao Court?"
After speaking, Marquis Dingxiang also felt the second possibility was unlikely. The Dao Court would find it difficult to trust a demon cultivator.
Demon cultivators could only rely on Daoists. The Dao Court had never directly granted the qualification to break through to the Five Talisman realm to a demon cultivator.
If he were a rogue demon cultivator, it would make sense. This demon might have received information and, confident in his strength, entered to fish in troubled waters.
The Ghostfang Kingdom occupied the Gangshan Governance Altar, and its Merit Seal was their foundation in this realm. Like Daoists, demon cultivators seeking to become Demon Kings had to first secure a position within the Merit Seal.
There were also free spirits among the demon race who disdained restraint. They sought to obtain a Third-Rank Dharma Position and then secluded themselves within the demon kingdoms of the Jushan Governance Altar. The price was eternal inability to break through to the Five Talisman realm.
Who could resist the allure of the Merit Seal? Ultimately, they would still join the Ghostfang Kingdom. However, there were always exceptions.
These demon cultivators could only continuously hone themselves, potentially comprehending a Dharma Idol.
Of course, this possibility was extremely low. The Ghostfang Kingdom wasn't lacking in talented demons who received personal guidance from Demon Kings or even Great Sages, yet those who comprehended a Dharma Idol were few and far between.
He had followed Demon King Lingyou for many years and only grasped the basics.
"Regardless of his origins, I will ensure he doesn't return," Marquis Dingxiang declared fiercely.
Demon King Lingyou glanced at Marquis Dingxiang, his expression betraying no emotion. "The Dharma Idol power he displayed was slightly inferior to yours. However, that may not be the full extent of his strength."
Marquis Dingxiang was awestruck, understanding that the Demon King was cautioning him. He hastily bowed in acknowledgment.
Unaware of this conversation among the demon cultivators, Qin Sang had already fled far away. After confirming there were no pursuers, his figure paused, and he raised the demon corpse in his hand to examine it.
With the situation urgent, Qin Sang couldn't afford to hold back.
Marquis Gui's life force was extinguished, his spirit severely damaged, leaving only a remnant soul.
Qin Sang didn't bother with pleasantries and moved to search his soul. Marquis Gui was terrified and pleaded repeatedly, revealing everything he knew.
"So it really is self-severing..."
Qin Sang murmured.
Marquis Gui recounted that when they encountered the Dao Court earlier, Demon King Lingyou had warned them not to fear Grand True Men.
The Grand True Men had already self-severed their cultivation, falling to the Grotto Profound realm. Even without Demon King Lingyou present, the Demon Marquises, by forming a demon formation, could escape.
Presumably, the Demon Kings were no exception.
This relieved Qin Sang considerably. Otherwise, he truly would have to reconsider whether or not to snatch food from the tiger's mouth in the presence of a Demon King.
"How long have you been inside? Has Demon King Lingyou discovered anything?" Qin Sang asked coldly.
Marquis Gui answered without reservation. They had also entered the blue sea of light not long ago. This was the second tremor they had encountered.
Demon King Lingyou seemed to have sensed something during the tremor and ordered an investigation.
Qin Sang clarified Demon King Lingyou's orders and, combining them with the various scenes during the tremor, fell into deep thought.
A moment later, Qin Sang sealed Marquis Gui's remnant soul, placing it with the female demon. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and continued flying towards the source of the tremors.
…
Hidden currents surged within the blue sea of light.
Beyond the sea of light, the wind and clouds churned even more violently.
The golden light rapidly receded. The nine Primordial Embryos were far more illusory than before and would soon exhaust their power, completely disappearing.
However, the Primordial Embryo Formation had completed its task, its indication exceedingly clear. Teams of cultivators and demon cultivators converged upon the location.
Unexpectedly, the area indicated by the Primordial Embryo Formation was sparse in illusory scenes, filled with vast expanses of auspicious clouds.
When the old Daoist led True Man Wan and the others to arrive, they saw two teams of Dao Court experts patrolling outside the area, True Man Ruoquan among them.
The old Daoist immediately went forward to join them and inquire about the situation.
True Man Ruoquan said worriedly, "Those demons have planned this in advance. Their gathering speed far exceeds ours. I'm afraid..."
"It doesn't matter," the old Daoist glanced around. "As long as we wait for one more fellow Daoist, with our demonic soldier talisman formation, it will be enough to contend with them."
Although they had self-severed their cultivation and couldn't retain their Dharma Bodies like Demon Kings, their subordinate forces were more than a notch stronger than those of Grotto Profound True Men. This was their source of confidence.
As they spoke, the True Men all looked towards the front.
Even through the illusory scenes, they could sense unusual fluctuations there. The jade talismans in their hands emitted a faint light, faintly resonating with that place.
Before long, another team of Dao Court experts arrived.
After a brief discussion, the True Men summoned their respective forces.
In an instant, demonic soldiers formed ranks, their banners like a forest, a vast and uncountable dark mass.
These demonic soldiers were clearly elite troops at a glance. There were nearly twenty True Men present, but the variety of demonic soldiers wasn't extensive. Most True Men commanded only three to five types of demonic soldiers, and many had recruited the same kind.
Within the formations, Governance Altars floated, four of them particularly divine and clearly more substantial than the others.
These four belonged to the four Grand True Men, with the old Daoist's at the front and the other three arrayed in a line behind him.
The other True Men also summoned their Governance Altars, guarding the four Grand True Men.
The Governance Altars were linked by their Qi. It was less a demonic soldier formation and more a Governance Altar formation.
As several streaks of talismanic light descended, the demonic soldiers belonging to the Governance Altars were woven into a single force.
The old Daoist lightly flicked his dust whisk and paced in the Taiwei Steps, chanting an incantation with each step.
It was as if he held the mandate of heaven. With each incantation, the demonic soldiers' auras involuntarily erupted, surging skyward and forming dark clouds above.
Dark clouds threatened the city.
The demonic soldiers, however, became increasingly excited, roaring incessantly, their voices shaking the heavens. The True Men also assisted with their talismans and techniques.
‘Snap!’
With the final罡step taken, the dark clouds suddenly solidified, unexpectedly transforming into a black talisman diagram out of thin air, descending from the sky.
The talisman diagram, originally formed from the condensed Qi of all the troops, seamlessly integrated into the battle formation.
In an instant, black Qi billowed within the formation. The troops were no longer individual demonic soldiers but a unified whole, impregnable!
"Heaven clear, Earth serene, soldiers and generals obey my command.
Soldiers follow the seal's rotation, generals follow my orders!"
The old Daoist flicked his dust whisk forward. The True Men and demonic soldiers roared in acknowledgement. The black Qi transformed into a giant sword, pointing straight ahead. Within, shadows flickered, faintly revealing the radiant light of the Governance Altars.
In just a dozen breaths, the giant sword of black Qi effortlessly pierced through the illusory scenes, appearing within the sight of the Ghostfang Kingdom's demon cultivators without losing a single soldier.
Stared down by dozens of demon cultivators, including Demon Kings, the black Qi showed no signs of weakening. Its momentum even surged.
Despite being outnumbered, these demon cultivators all wore grave expressions. Several Demon Kings unhesitatingly summoned their Dharma Idols – flying birds, running beasts, and various other forms, as if a multitude of demons were dancing wildly.
‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’
One after another, Dharma Idols blocked the path of the giant black Qi sword. The demons poised themselves, ready for battle.
‘Crack!’
Black clouds covered the sky, and blue demonic lightning coursed through them, striking directly at the Dao Court’s formation.
Beneath the giant black Qi sword, the ground transformed into a marsh, while walls of thick stone materialized before it. The sounds of dragons roaring and tigers howling echoed, carrying strange fluctuations that assaulted the formation.
Behind the Demon Kings' Dharma Idols and the assembled demons, a white-robed scholar sat cross-legged in the air, seemingly oblivious to the surrounding changes.
His hands rested flat on his knees, one palm gleaming with golden light, the other forming a specific hand seal.
Within the golden light lay half of a token. Characters were inscribed on the token, but it was also split in two, making the inscription difficult to discern.
With the white-robed scholar’s movements, the golden light intensified, and the golden token trembled, as if attempting to escape his grasp.
Seeing this, the old Daoist’s expression changed drastically. Flipping his palm, he revealed half of a golden token in his hand as well.
If the two halves were combined, they would form the character '敕' (Imperial Decree)!
This token was an Imperial Decree of the Dao Court. During the Dao Court's prime, some important decrees were issued through the Divine Court.
This decree must have been unsent, remaining hidden within the Divine Court until it suddenly reappeared a hundred years ago. Not long ago, it was confirmed to still possess remnants of the Divine Court's aura. Through this token, one could still sense the Divine Court. The previous conflict had been over this very decree, with each side obtaining half.
At this moment, the old Daoist's half of the decree also radiated golden light.
He tossed the half-token into the air and formed a seal with one hand, attempting to seal it.
The two halves were essentially one. By sealing this half, he could stop the white-robed scholar and buy time.
The white-robed scholar glanced over coldly, letting out a disdainful snort. He flicked his finger sharply towards the half-token!
