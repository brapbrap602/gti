<h1>## Chapter 1426: Battle of Divine Powers</h1><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The ‘卍’  character runes on the mountain's surface bulged frequently.</p><p>As the Old Devil Hunmo and the others destroyed the restrictions on the Golden Peak and the Buddha Pagoda, the seal was already on the verge of collapse. Not only the Herb Garden, but also other places successively showed anomalies.</p><p>Purple flowing flames, drifting in the void, flew around chaotically, exacerbating this chaos.</p><p>Pavilions and towers collapsed or exploded, one after another, with constant loud noises and rising smoke.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded in rotation throughout the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>In this almost apocalyptic scenery, the Herb Garden's anomaly seemed less special and wouldn't directly arouse the suspicion of those Nascent Souls.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Endless purple mist spewed out, dyeing the air, almost completely occupying that space, making it difficult not to attract attention.</p><p>While the purple mist expanded, various Buddhist restrictions also flashed and collided, causing the surrounding mountains to vibrate violently.</p><p>Within this, the scene inside the Herb Garden frequently flashed, appearing somewhat blurry in the purple mist, but unable to block the view of those Nascent Souls.</p><p>Patches of scorched earth.</p><p>Sprouts of withered spiritual trees.</p><p>Regrettable.</p><p>Suddenly, everyone's gaze froze.</p><p>Amidst these desolate scenes, a glimmer of vitality appeared. It was actually an intact Herb Garden. Although the spiritual herbs appeared listless, they stubbornly survived under the scorching aura of the crimson flames.</p><p>“Night God Flower!”</p><p>“That’s Profound Yin Epiphyllum…the main ingredient for the Profound Longevity Pill!”</p><p>…</p><p>The newly arrived Nascent Souls abruptly halted, exclaiming in surprise.</p><p>The Profound Longevity Pill was a precious elixir capable of increasing lifespan, and among all similar elixirs that had appeared in the world, its effect was top-tier. The value of the Profound Yin Epiphyllum could be imagined.</p><p>The other spiritual herbs that flashed in the Herb Garden included several whose value was not inferior to the Profound Yin Epiphyllum, and the rest were all spiritual herbs that could move a Nascent Soul’s heart.</p><p>The Profound Yin Epiphyllum and other spiritual herbs were all things that had appeared in the cultivation world before. Qin Sang had seen them in classics before and had Tan Hao conjure them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't choose those legendary peerless immortal herbs, although the effects were better, they would also more easily arouse suspicion.</p><p>These were enough to make the Nascent Souls outside feel their hearts pounding.</p><p>"Herb Garden!"</p><p>Someone whispered, without suspicion.</p><p>From those patches of scorched earth, it could be seen that most of the Herb Garden had been destroyed by the crimson flame aura. Only the most precious spiritual herbs were protected by the most powerful restrictions, allowing them to persist until now.</p><p>Judging from the power of the sect-protecting grand formation and the seal, one could imagine that the strength of this sect was definitely astonishing back then, and it was normal to have treasured spiritual herbs of this level.</p><p>The Precept Holder Arhat  in front of the Buddha Pagoda paused in his actions of breaking the restrictions after seeing the Herb Garden. The Nascent Soul on his left side even had a look of extreme regret.</p><p>Had he known this earlier, he would definitely have chosen to go to the Herb Garden.</p><p>The treasures in the Buddha Pagoda and Golden Peak might not be comparable to those spiritual herbs!</p><p>In front of the Golden Peak Grand Hall.</p><p>At this time, the power of the restrictions was at its last gasp.</p><p>The Old Devil Hunmo and the Feather-Clad Yuanjun  were also not immune, startled by the Herb Garden, and therefore distracted.</p><p>The Profound Yin Epiphyllum and other spiritual herbs also had a great attraction for the Old Devil Hunmo.</p><p>His gaze locked onto several spiritual herbs in the purple mist. Seeing that some of the newly arrived Nascent Souls had changed direction and rushed towards the Herb Garden, his turbid pupils erupted with a deep killing intent.</p><p>The Feather-Clad Yuanjun felt the killing intent emanating from the Old Devil Hunmo, and her spine felt somewhat chilled.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>The Old Devil Hunmo seemed to have discovered something. His expression suddenly stiffened, his eyes turned into pitch-black devil pupils, then he suddenly turned his head back, his face full of rage.</p><p>"Who!"</p><p>Hearing the Old Devil Hunmo's roar, the Feather-Clad Yuanjun finally noticed something was amiss.</p><p>The restrictions on the Golden Peak Grand Hall had an unusual fluctuation. This fluctuation was not caused by their breaking of the restrictions, but came from another direction!</p><p>At the same time, the power of the restrictions was rapidly depleting.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Behind the mysterious stone statue, a cracking sound suddenly came. A crack appeared in the hidden door, then a ball of black flame crawled out of the crack, transforming into a fire snake, rushing straight towards the treasures in the Buddha Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity and decisively made his move.</p><p>Moreover, having learned about some of the rules of the Golden Peak's restrictions from Tan Hao, and observing the opponent's process of breaking the restrictions, Qin Sang could control his actions, reduce the overall damage to the restrictions, and forcibly break open a gap.</p><p>Coupled with the anomaly in the Herb Garden distracting the opponent.</p><p>Double restrictions caused the opponent to be unable to intercept him at the first moment, thus buying precious time.</p><p>Seizing the treasures was not the end point; a safe retreat was the true success. Otherwise, Qin Sang would face five Nascent Souls alone, including a Great Cultivator!</p><p>"There’s a thief!"</p><p>The thought flashed through the Feather-Clad Yuanjun’s mind. Realizing that the appearance of the Herb Garden’s anomaly was perfectly timed, she instantly understood what had happened and was immediately shocked and furious.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The Old Devil Hunmo’s withered hand clenched tightly. The black bamboo staff erupted with deep black light and stabbed forward forcefully, sharp as a spear, actually penetrating the light barrier formed by the restrictions.</p><p>At the same time, the Hunmo Token  had somehow fallen into his other hand, and was slammed fiercely onto the Golden Peak's restrictions.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Golden Peak shook violently, as if it was about to collapse.</p><p>With the Hunmo Token as the center, countless cracks appeared on the light barrier, and it looked like it could no longer hold on.</p><p>But at this moment, the fire snake had already been launched into the grand hall, and was rapidly rushing towards the offering table, its target clearly the Pure Treasure Orb  that the Old Devil Hunmo and the Feather-Clad Yuanjun had long coveted.</p><p>The struggle between experts was only a matter of a moment.</p><p>By the time they broke through the restrictions, even a moment's delay would be enough for the fire snake to sweep away all the treasures in the grand hall.</p><p>The Old Devil Hunmo let out a cold snort. Using his mind for two purposes, he activated the Hunmo Token. At the same time, the black light at the top of the black bamboo staff twisted like a living creature and shot out.</p><p>Halfway through, the black light twisted, vaguely forming the prototype of a large hand.</p><p>The Feather-Clad Yuanjun was also clearly aware of the key to victory or defeat and made the most correct choice.</p><p>Her delicate body flashed, sticking closely to the light barrier. Her five fingers stretched out, her nails rapidly lengthening, turning into scarlet demon fingers. Then, her hand turned into claws, forcefully piercing into the light barrier, making a sharp, ear-piercing sound.</p><p>And the Crimson Phoenix Fiend  suddenly retracted inward. The souls of men rushed forward, disregarding the backlash of the restrictions, forcibly crashing a crack in the light barrier. Then, the Crimson Phoenix Fiend silently seeped in, slower than the Old Devil Hunmo by a slight margin.</p><p>"Worthy of being a Great Cultivator…"</p><p>Hiding in the secret passage, Qin Sang sensed the outside through the crack, sighing inwardly.</p><p>He had made so many arrangements, but the effect was not as expected. The Old Devil Hunmo's reaction was faster than anticipated, and his intention to take all the treasures was impossible to achieve.</p><p>…</p><p>In the Buddha Hall, which had been silent for who knows how long, there were now three uninvited guests.</p><p>To be exact, three kinds of divine powers .</p><p>Nine Nether Devil Fire  transformed into a fire snake.</p><p>Black demonic light condensed into a demonic palm.</p><p>The Crimson Phoenix Fiend was still in the form of scarlet silk.</p><p>Three forces, entering the Buddha Hall from three different directions, had a surprisingly consistent goal: the Pure Treasure Orb!</p><p>Qin Sang did have the advantage, and the Pure Treasure Orb was placed on the right side of the offering table, close to the stone statue. The fire snake was the first to entwine the Pure Treasure Orb.</p><p>In front of the Old Devil Hunmo and the Feather-Clad Yuanjun, half of the Nine Nether Devil Fire broke through a layer of light shield, wrapped the Pure Treasure Orb, and rebounded back!</p>
