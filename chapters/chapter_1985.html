<h1>Chapter 1976: Serving Tea</h1><p>A streak of light shot out from the Soulfall Abyss, incredibly swift, piercing through the wasteland and into the Twilight Mountains, heading directly east.</p><p>The streak of light, like a grey wave of smoke, tore through the vast sky, rolling and surging, majestic and imposing.</p><p>‘Rumble… Rumble…’</p><p>The sound of breaking the sound barrier was like heavenly thunder descending upon the world, shaking heaven and earth, bringing an unprecedented shock to the wasteland and the Twilight Mountains.</p><p>Countless cultivators were startled awake from their meditative trances, their faces filled with alarm.</p><p>Even before hearing the thunderous sound, they could feel a terrifying pressure, pervading heaven and earth.</p><p>It felt as if the sky was about to collapse!</p><p>Instinctive fear made countless people tremble, cowering and shivering in their caves.</p><p>The end of the world seemed imminent, with the heavens collapsing and the earth splitting apart, leaving nowhere to escape.</p><p>The thought of resistance simply couldn't arise in their minds, as if that pressure represented the will of heaven and earth.</p><p>Born between heaven and earth, how could one dare to defy the will of heaven and earth?</p><p>……</p><p>Within a valley, lush greenery stretched like a sea, with ancient trees reaching towards the heavens.</p><p>‘Chirp… Chirp… Chirp…’</p><p>Joyful calls came from the forest.</p><p>Through the gaps in the leaves, one could see a group of white-furred, long-armed Spirit Apes chasing and playing.</p><p>These Spirit Apes leaped from branch to branch, as if walking on flat ground, incredibly agile.</p><p>Their movements possessed a strange rhythm, like a unique movement technique, completely natural and unforced.</p><p>The Spirit Apes were completely unaware.</p><p>On a nearby tree, a faint human figure stood, observing the Spirit Apes with interest, fingers gently moving, seemingly mimicking their movements.</p><p>Suddenly, this person's expression changed drastically.  Their figure flickered, pressing close against the tree trunk, their body seeping into the bark like water, merging with the ancient tree.</p><p>The ancient tree's bark twisted, revealing a terrified human face.</p><p>The Spirit Apes also sensed the anomaly, letting out sharp shrieks and scattering in all directions.</p><p>Hidden within the tree, this person still felt uneasy, and escaped from the trunk into the ground, using a secret technique to hide within the tree roots.</p><p>The next moment, the streak of light flew overhead.</p><p>Underground, a human figure, as small as a cicada, huddled within the tree roots, their whole body trembling uncontrollably, not daring to return to the surface for a long time.</p><p>……</p><p>A certain wondrous peak in the Twilight Mountains.</p><p>The scenery was picturesque, brimming with spiritual energy.</p><p>Here resided a sect named the Eight Tripods Sect, neither entirely righteous nor entirely evil, quite renowned throughout the Twilight Mountains.</p><p>The founding ancestor of the Eight Tripods Sect was a Nascent Soul cultivator.  Subsequent sect leaders failed to surpass the ancestor.  The current sect leader, having discovered flaws in the cultivation method, rectified them and achieved a breakthrough to the Deity Transformation stage in one fell swoop, a true prodigy.</p><p>Due to the current sect leader's remarkable feat, the Eight Tripods Sect's fame spread throughout the Twilight Mountains.</p><p>However, this sect leader was very clear-headed.  He did not rush to expand the Eight Tripods Sect, opting for steady progress, and restrained his disciples from becoming arrogant.</p><p>On this day, the tranquility of the mountain gate was shattered by urgent bell tolls.</p><p>The Profound Bell's ringing signified that the Eight Tripods Sect faced a life-or-death crisis.</p><p>Accompanying the bell tolls was the sect leader's roar, "Quickly activate the Mountain Protection Grand Formation!"</p><p>The Eight Tripods Sect disciples were greatly alarmed.  It was the first time they had seen their sect leader so urgent and panicked.</p><p>The moment the grand formation was activated, a terrifying pressure swept across.</p><p>Even the Mountain Protection Grand Formation could not block that pressure.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The Eight Tripods Sect disciples trembled, involuntarily kneeling on the ground.</p><p>In front of the main hall, the Eight Tripods Sect leader stared intently at the streak of light in the sky, stabilizing his mind with immense willpower.</p><p>His eyes were filled with awe, terror, and intense anticipation!</p><p>……</p><p>The river surged.</p><p>The river flowed between two mountains, the terrain treacherous, the current swift.</p><p>White waves constantly splashed on the river's surface.</p><p>From time to time, river fish leaped out of the water.  As they fell back, a slender black shadow would rise from beneath the surface, revealing a sharp snout filled with fangs, swallowing the fish in one gulp.</p><p>When the pressure arrived,</p><p>In an instant, the wind howled and the waves surged, as if the water at the bottom of the river had been churned upwards.</p><p>The streak of light flew past, disappearing into the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The river gradually calmed down.  A monster, neither snake nor fish, floated to the surface, belly up, lifeless.</p><p>It was the fish-swallowing beast.</p><p>It had actually been scared to death on the spot!</p><p>……</p><p>The higher one's cultivation, the more they could feel the immense power of the master of this escaping light.</p><p>They had finally witnessed the legendary Void Refinement cultivator who could control heaven and earth, but that kind of impact was not something everyone could withstand.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu seemed extremely urgent, breaking through the void and not concealing his movements at all.</p><p>He had no choice but to be anxious. The Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar was unearthed by the Nine Immortals of Cloud Metropolis. Only two people were present at the Soulfall Abyss, and they were utterly powerless to stop the Nine Immortals of Cloud Metropolis.</p><p>A moment's delay might allow the Cloud Metropolis Heavenly Speed Sect to gain the upper hand.</p><p>Concealing his aura was also meaningless. In the vicinity, the only one qualified to compete with him for the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar was Solitary Cloud叟.</p><p>With the emergence of the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar, even Solitary Cloud叟 couldn't remain calmly seated. He would definitely descend the mountain as well.</p><p>The value of a single Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar surpassed all other legacies combined. The gentlemen's agreement between the two sects did not include the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar!</p><p>Solitary Cloud叟, traveling with his Dharma Body, though not as imposing as Patriarch Minghu, also caused quite a stir in the Cloud Metropolis Mountain, his speed no less swift.</p><p>……</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang had left seclusion at some point, leaving the underground chamber and ascending into the sky, gazing towards the north.</p><p>"They're already coming out?"</p><p>Void Refinement cultivators in motion, shaking the world.</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, feeling quite surprised.</p><p>He had made his move in the Fire Domain, interfering in the mortal world. All his plans were aimed at drawing out the two Void Refinement cultivators.</p><p>Today, his wish was granted, but it was somewhat unexpected.</p><p>Too fast, too easy.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the true value of the Crimson Fire Copper Pillar.</p><p>Relying on this item alone to alarm two Void Refinement cultivators might have a slight chance, but Qin Sang didn't hold much hope.</p><p>As long as it could incite conflict between the two sects and deepen their contradictions, it would have served its purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang had made two sets of preparations. While making his move, he also interfered in the mortal world, stirring up the situation, and gradually dragging the two sects into the mire.</p><p>He hadn't expected to succeed so easily.  All his subsequent plans were now unnecessary.</p><p>This showed that the value of the Crimson Fire Copper Pillar far exceeded his estimations.</p><p>Missing out on the treasure, Qin Sang didn't feel any regret, because it wasn't important.</p><p>Instead, he felt a faint excitement, eager to try.</p><p>Perfect timing!</p><p>Some ideas could finally be verified!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed as he looked down at the Qingyang Temple below.</p><p>Smoke curled from chimneys at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Yu Lang had achieved fame and success, and the academy had become a sacred place in the hearts of the Yan Kingdom's people. Scholars came to pay homage in an endless stream.</p><p>Seven Rows Village benefited from this, expanding again and again, becoming increasingly prosperous, gradually transforming into a small town.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed his palm downwards.</p><p>An invisible barrier enveloped the land, blocking the sight of mortals and concealing all fluctuations.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The mountain peak where Qingyang Temple was located suddenly cracked.</p><p>The fissure ran through the mountain, passing right through Qingyang Temple, splitting the main hall in two.</p><p>The mountain slowly tilted to both sides, on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>The interior of the mountain was exposed, lightning flashing, the main altar revealed!</p><p>Qin Sang sat in meditation high in the sky, directly above the main altar, his eyes closed, forming a thunder seal with his hands.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>A muffled thunderous sound, as if emanating from the depths of the earth, echoed throughout this space.</p><p>The mortals below couldn't hear the thunder at all, continuing to live their normal lives.</p><p>Even the cultivators near Jinyi County were completely unaware.</p><p>All unusual phenomena were deliberately suppressed by Qin Sang, but his actions didn't stop.  His hand seals changed continuously, faster and faster.</p><p>With each seal formed, a thunder talisman would leave his hand and merge into the main altar.</p><p>Then, lightning would be generated from the main altar, shooting towards the sky, divine thunder filling the heavens.</p><p>In an instant, a vast sea of thunder manifested between heaven and earth.</p><p>Qin Sang was immersed in this sea of thunder, and these thunders formed a colossal thunder altar directly beneath him.</p><p>This altar connected heaven and earth, brewing divine power, yet remaining dormant!</p><p>The next moment, the main altar below exhibited further unusual activity, emitting a dazzling silver light that even surpassed the thunder sea above.</p><p>A silver ‘sheet’ emerged within the main altar, radiating an exceptionally mystical aura.</p><p>The surface of the silver sheet was covered in writing.</p><p>The writing constantly shifted and changed.</p><p>These characters were incredibly profound, resonating with the fundamental principles of heaven and earth. A single character seemed to contain boundless knowledge.</p><p>A mere glance from a mortal could cause their mind to collapse, their head exploding!</p><p>The silver sheet undulated, as if it might detach from the altar and shoot towards the sky at any moment, but it was also suppressed by Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's actions were precisely to activate the altar, not to unleash its power, but to gather momentum.</p><p>With the main altar revealed, the entire altar formation was activated.</p><p>In the four directions, east, south, west, and north, Taiyi, Luohou, Lingshi, and Guihou, the four Deity Transformation cultivators, sat cross-legged on the branch altars, their faces solemn.</p><p>They presided over the four branch altars, acting as the four pillars of the formation, stabilizing the four directions and safeguarding the main altar!</p><p>Qin Sang's will, transmitted through the main altar via the altar formation, caused the branch altars beneath the four Deity Transformation cultivators to simultaneously flash with thunder light.</p><p>Besides the four branch altars, other branch altars also had altar masters presiding over them.</p><p>These altar masters included fire spirits and demons, with almost no humans, and they all revealed their true forms.</p><p>Over the years, they had been assigned to the four Deity Transformation cultivators, cultivating thunder arts, and all had achieved a certain level of mastery.</p><p>At this moment, these demon creatures sat cross-legged, imitating human posture, following the commands from some unknown source and casting spells, their bodies ignited with blazing thunder fire.</p><p>It was as if the altars themselves were burning.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't require them to have high comprehension. As long as they could utilize thunder arts, preside over the branch altars, and stabilize the altar formation, it was sufficient.</p><p>The four Deity Transformation cultivators received Qin Sang's guidance, and these branch altar masters obeyed the four Deity Transformation cultivators.</p><p>The branch altars, the main altar, and all the altar masters were connected as one, forming a vast altar formation that encompassed the mortal world!</p><p>Qin Sang was the master of the main altar, the controller of the altar formation.</p><p>This was the first time he had truly activated the altar, and as he sensed the entire formation, a strange expression appeared on his face.</p><p>At this moment, what he thought of were scenes from the Talisman World.</p><p>The remnants of the Dao Court, relying on altars, gathered the power of the Dao, and Celestial Master Zhang, with the aid of the altar, invoked divine power to break through, slaying a Great Ascension cultivator in one fell swoop.</p><p>The awe-inspiring divine might was truly captivating.</p><p>Qin Sang finally experienced the power of the altar firsthand. It truly lived up to its reputation!</p><p>And the altar beneath him definitely wouldn't rank among the top within the entire Dao Court.</p><p>The path of immortality was long, and he still had a long way to go.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, slowly opening his eyes and rising to stand on the thunder altar.</p><p>Looking around, Qin Sang took a step to his left, leaving an identical copy of himself in his original spot.</p><p>Two Qin Sangs stood side by side, one his true body, the other his Dharma Body.</p><p>This was a true Dharma Body, not like the incarnations he had sent down to the mortal world in previous lives.</p><p>The Dharma Body slightly raised its hands, palms facing down. Sword light flashed, and a sword image appeared, the sword hanging upside down, slowly rotating.</p><p>This sword was the Grey Warbler Sword.</p><p>Moreover, it was the Grey Warbler Sword that had transformed into a spiritual treasure, having birthed a sword spirit!</p><p>‘Hum! Hum!’</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword, seemingly sensing its master's thoughts, emitted sharp sword cries, full of spirit.</p><p>The spiritual sword radiated killing intent.  Its edge would follow its master's will, severing all enemies!</p><p>"Caw! Caw!"</p><p>Along with the sword cries came strange bird calls.</p><p>A ring of fire danced around the Grey Warbler Sword.  It was the Vermilion Bird.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird seemed to have been suppressed for too long.  Without any semblance of a sacred beast's demeanor, its cries were filled with excitement, urging Qin Sang:  "Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! This Vermilion Bird can't wait any longer!  The first strike belongs to this Vermilion Bird!"</p><p>This foolish bird was truly audacious, fearing nothing under heaven.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head inwardly.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird knew what they were about to do, yet it showed no fear or worry.</p><p>The Dharma Body flicked its sleeve, storing the Grey Warbler Sword and the Vermilion Bird within.</p><p>At the same time, a cyan light appeared behind Qin Sang's true body.  The pure cyan light was accompanied by a phoenix cry as the Azure Phoenix Dharma Image was summoned!</p><p>The Azure Phoenix spread its wings, its wings covering the sky.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix Dharma Image fully extended its body, flew high into the sky, and then dove down, transforming into a cyan light that poured into Qin Sang through the top of his head.</p><p>The Dharma Image merged with his physical body, and Qin Sang's aura instantly changed.</p><p>At the same time, five-colored light flashed, and Xiao Wu appeared.</p><p>Having returned to the mountain, Xiao Wu seemed to have forgotten the mortal world, cleansed of worldly distractions.</p><p>She still kept her eyes closed, standing beside Qin Sang with a serene expression, innocent and carefree.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body took Xiao Wu's small hand, nodded to the Dharma Body, and headed northeast.</p><p>……</p><p>Cloud Metropolis Mountain.</p><p>Solitary Cloud叟 left the mountain gate, traveling westward alone.</p><p>His escape technique was quite peculiar. He pointed the purple bamboo staff in his hand forward, its tip touching the void, and purple light erupted.</p><p>The purple light was like lightning, instantly traversing mountain ranges. When the purple light faded, Solitary Cloud叟 would appear within it.</p><p>The purple lightning continuously leaped, gradually reaching the edge of Cloud Metropolis Mountain.</p><p>Solitary Cloud叟 held the staff in one hand and made calculations with the other, his expression not at ease.</p><p>"That Corpse Demon, I wonder if its divine abilities are fully developed. If so, it will be difficult to deal with..."</p><p>While pondering, Solitary Cloud叟 suddenly sensed something, his expression changing abruptly.  He heavily tapped the void with his purple bamboo staff, stopping the purple lightning.</p><p>Ahead, on a mountaintop, stood a strange Daoist, arms crossed behind his back, gazing towards him.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, from where do you hail, and why do you block my path!"</p><p>Solitary Cloud叟 shouted sternly, but he didn't act rashly.</p><p>He sensed the aura of a Dharma Image from Qin Sang.</p><p>Although some exceptionally talented demon cultivators could comprehend Dharma Images in the Deity Transformation stage, it was absolutely impossible for them to possess such powerful and dense Dharma Image power!</p><p>Something unusual must be happening.</p><p>This Daoist was a complete stranger to him, yet he blocked his path at this time. Could he be a helper summoned by the Corpse Demon?</p><p>"This humble Daoist is Qingfeng. I have long admired Fellow Daoist Solitary Cloud叟's great name, and have come specifically to pay my respects."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed from afar, stepping aside to reveal what was behind him: a stone table carved into a Go board, two stone stools, and black and white Go pieces.</p><p>The board and pieces were all carved from ordinary stone, locally sourced.</p><p>"I've heard that Fellow Daoist is skilled in the art of Go. This humble Daoist would like to invite you to a game. I wonder if you would be interested?" Qin Sang gestured in invitation.</p><p>Solitary Cloud叟 narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing Qin Sang for a moment, then glanced at the Go board, seemingly pondering something.</p><p>After a short while, he actually flew forward and landed on one side of the board, lightly tapping the ground with his purple bamboo staff.</p><p>Qin Sang smoothed his Daoist robe, sat down, and instructed, "Xiao Wu, serve tea!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Xiao Wu approached with a tea tray.</p><p>Like an obedient young Daoist attendant, she knelt properly at the side, arranged the teapot and teacups, and began to meticulously prepare the tea.</p>
