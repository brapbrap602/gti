<h1>Chapter 309 Comprehending the Dao of Murder</h1><p>Chapter 309 Comprehending the Dao of Murder</p><p>Yunyouzi received the Cigarettes of Serenity and after looking it over decided to gather the small amount of spiritual power in his body and use his palm as a furnace and his spiritual power as fire to refine the Cigarettes of Serenity.</p><p>The emerald-green spiritual herb became a drop of green fluid as if the naked eye could see it happen.</p><p>A heavy fragrance immediately filled the entire cavern-dwelling.</p><p>Seeing that Yunyouzi could still refine the spiritual medicine steadily in this state and not lose a bit of the medicinal properties, Qinsang admired him in secret and made up his mind to have him refine the Profound Patterns Harmonic Elixir once he recovered.</p><p>There was no need to ask a Foundation Establishment cultivator to act.</p><p>When Qinsang mentioned it to Shangguan Lifeng again, he claimed that his contribution was small and refused to take the spiritual medicine no matter what, only taking two of Ge Yuan’s Dharma artifacts. They weren’t very valuable.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng said hesitantly: “Daoist priest, I have a shameless request. Earlier when Luo Xingnan was killed, I saw the Daoist priest use a spiritual sword, and the sword Qi’s killing intent was especially pure. Cooperating with the large formation, it managed to shock Luo Xingnan for a moment. Such killing intent is very special. I’ve never seen such a thing. I wonder if the priest can give me some pointers?”</p><p>Hearing Shangguan Lifeng’s unexpected request, Qinsang lightly gasped.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng’s eyesight was good. Luo Xingnan was burned by the Ghost Soul Thread and his soul became chaotic, and then with the murderous intent after the killing talisman exploded, it truly shocked Luo Xingnan for a moment.</p><p>They seized this opportunity and killed Luo Xingnan.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng was interested in the killing talisman’s killing intent. Could it be that he also followed the Dao of Murder?</p><p>Then, Qinsang remembered that when he first met Shangguan Lifeng at Xifan Town, Shangguan Lifeng gave him the first impression as a swordsman who was skilled in swordsmanship.</p><p>无论是人还是刀，都锋芒毕露。Both the man and the sword were very sharp.</p><p>Seeing Qinsang ask, Shangguan Lifeng didn’t hide anything and said frankly: “After my teacher was murdered, I was enraged and I was only left with hatred and killing intent. I never thought that a blessing in disguise would allow me to sense the crucial chance to break through the bottleneck of Foundation Establishment, and then I followed this path and never turned back, and also collected many relevant tactics and scriptures. I used killing intent to integrate with the art of the sword. There was a small accomplishment, and so I decided to continue to follow this path.</p><p>The killing intent in the Daoist priest’s sword Qi is the purest I’ve seen in my life. If the Daoist priest can help me even a little, it would be more important to me than a thousand-year spiritual medicine. I’m willing to give up the Lingbi Tree to the Daoist priest as well.”</p><p>So that’s how it is.</p><p>Qinsang slowly shook his head.</p><p>He didn’t want Shangguan Lifeng’s LIngbi Tree and his expression was embarrassed as he said: “I won’t lie to Daoist Shangguang, my talent is ordinary and the killing intent in my sword Qi was something that already existed in the tactic. Although I cultivated bitterly, I’ve only comprehended a bit of its fur, I’m afraid I can’t really explain it.”</p><p>The killing intent came from the Divine Consciousness Nurturing Sword Chapter’s killing talisman.</p><p>Qinsang didn’t lie. Although he treats the tactic as a tool to improve his cultivation, he did also truly study and understand it. Whether it was due to his limits in talent or the problem with the path he chose, overall he didn’t understand much of what was his own and he was always stuck within the limitations outlined by the tactic.</p><p>Originally, Qinsang still hoped to try to comprehend the incomplete latter half of the Divine Consciousness Nurturing Sword Chapter after forming his golden core, but reality cruelly destroyed his hope.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng lowered his head in disappointment.</p><p>“However…”</p><p>Qinsang’s tone changed. “If you trust your Daoist priest, there is another way.”</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng suddenly looked up with wide eyes, and his tone was eager as he asked: “Daoist priest, please tell me!”</p><p>Qinsang hesitated: “Your Daoist priest can activate sword Qi and let you experience the killing intent for yourself. However, Daoist friend will need to use your divine consciousness to make contact with the sword Qi and concentrate fully. This way…”</p><p>This way, it’s like Shangguan Lifeng is defenseless against Qinsang. If Qinsang suddenly has evil thoughts, he can easily take Shangguan Lifeng’s life.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Shangguan Lifeng agreed without hesitation: “Thank you for fulfilling Daoist priest’s request!”</p><p>“Have you considered carefully?”</p><p>Qinsang asked once more with a serious expression, receiving Shangguan Lifeng’s exact answer.</p><p>Next, the two stood up and faced each other, with a distance of about ten feet between them.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng put down his sword and withdrew all of his spiritual power into his Qi Sea, he stood there unguarded with his divine consciousness spread and he softly said: “Daoist priest, begin!”</p><p>Qinsang faintly nodded, his brow flashed and the Ebony Sword flew out. In the blink of an eye it came to a halt in front of Shangguan Lifeng, the killing talisman on the sword body was suddenly activated, and endless killing intent was released.</p><p>He only wanted to have Shangguan Lifeng understand the killing talisman’s released killing intent. An easy task, it won’t cause Qinsang any harm.</p><p>The sword aura made contact with Shangguan Lifeng's divine sense.</p><p>With Qin Sang, restricting it, the sword aura didn't hurt Shangguan Lifeng.</p><p>However, the method of using divine sense to touch the killing talisman nakedly was incredibly dangerous. Shangguan Lifeng's face instantly became deathly pale, and waves of sweat flowed over his entire body. But, he persevered and gritted his teeth.</p><p>Seeing that Shangguan Lifeng could soon no longer hold on, Qin Sang withdrew the Blackwood Sword. Otherwise, he may have given Shangguan Lifeng irreversible damage.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng cupped his hands together in gratitude, immediately sitting down cross-legged. After he recovered, he repeated the process, doing so many times.</p><p>After Shangguan Lifeng completed his meditation, Vagrant Taoist had also ingested the spiritual fluid of the Aromatic Tobacco. Refining a portion, he awoke from his meditation and opened his eyes.</p><p>That millenniums-old spirit herb was something else. It hadn't even been that long, and Vagrant Taoist's face became much better. His qi sea had also recovered somewhat; at the very least, traveling alone was no longer a problem.</p><p>"I refined 30 percent of the medicinal strength. Its results are even better than what this old man imagined. Millenniums-old spirit herbs are violent. There is no rush. The remaining medicinal strength can be slowly refined later. This place is not someplace where we should stay for long. We should still hurry and return to a safe location," said Vagrant Taoist, sighing and standing up.</p><p>The three of them took a big circle, avoiding the Western Waste Town and returning to the outer region.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng bid them farewell and decided to return to his cave abode to go into closed-door cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Vagrant Taoist watched him go.</p><p>"That boy has good innate talent. What's praiseworthy is that he has a good disposition. He repays kindness. If Junior Brother Qin keeps him around, it should be quite helpful," said Vagrant Taoist.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't express his opinion.</p><p>Secrets must not be shared.</p><p>He had too many secrets. Allowing Shangguan Lifeng to know about the Ten Direction Yama Banner was because he had used the fake identity, Daoist Qingfeng.</p><p>It was better for them to go their separate ways.</p><p>"Senior, let's go."</p><p>Qin Sang turned and walked away. Shouldering with Vagrant Taoist, they stepped onto the boundless yellow sand, returning to Suspended Head Pass.</p><p>The Taiyi Pill Sect had its own cave abodes. Vagrant Taoist chose one that wasn't too far from Qin Sang. All he had to do was wait for his wounds to heal before starting to refine the Profound Pattern Accordance Pill.</p><p>At the same time, Vagrant Taoist ordered a steward of the Taiyi Pill Pavilion to gather supplementary herbs. The value of these supplementary herbs was far less than the main herbs. They were easy to find. Qin Sang only needed to pay the spirit stones and not worry about the rest.</p><p>The escape light landed in front of the cave abode. Qin Sang checked the array of the cave abode and confirmed that no one had touched it, before pushing open the door and entering.</p>
