<h1>Chapter 804: Azure鸾</h1><p>The Heavenly Demon Transformation requires the fourth level of the cultivation technique, equivalent to the Nascent Soul stage, still far beyond his reach. Qin Sang's focus was on the first three levels, carefully pondering whether he could cultivate them.</p><p>He spent several days and nights tirelessly studying the technique.</p><p>One day, he abruptly left Tianxing Island, flew far from the island chain for an entire day, and arrived at a deserted island, preparing to attempt cultivating the "Heavenly Demon Body Refining" technique there.</p><p>This technique draws power from the constellations. Unsure of the commotion it might cause, Qin Sang decided to experiment in the wilderness.</p><p>He casually set up a large formation. Due to the nature of the technique, he needed to be directly under the stars, so even a cave dwelling was unnecessary.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a rock, waiting for nightfall.</p><p>During the day, the scorching sun, filled with solar energy, wasn't ideal for cultivation, despite the possibility of drawing power from the stars.  At this time, the sun's power was at its peak, fiercely intense and volatile. Cultivating then could easily lead to burns, or even death by immolation if one wasn't careful. Only those with sufficiently high cultivation could withstand it.</p><p>The coolness of night was conducive to connecting with the stars.</p><p>The sun set in the west.</p><p>Twilight descended.</p><p>A thin veil covered the world, and the light gradually dimmed.</p><p>Finally, complete darkness enveloped the surroundings. The moon in the sky mirrored the moon's reflection in the sea.  Two galaxies, one celestial and one aquatic, shimmered in Qin Sang's view, bathed in starlight, ethereal and serene, a breathtaking scene.</p><p>After taking in the beautiful scenery, Qin Sang took out his bone flute, placed it horizontally across his knees, and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>“Eliminate distractions, hold onto your true self, visualize the Heavenly Demon…like a bright lamp hanging high, dispelling the clouds and mist, illuminating the path forward…”</p><p>Qin Sang silently recited the scriptures as he understood them.</p><p>The "Heavenly Demon Transformation" was profound, every word and sentence requiring careful consideration. Fortunately, Qin Sang came from a respectable lineage and possessed a deep foundation.</p><p>Visualization techniques were more common in Buddhist scriptures, which Qin Sang hadn't previously encountered.  However, whether Buddhist, Daoist, or Demonic, all emphasized guarding one's true self and eliminating distractions, so entry wasn't difficult.</p><p>Cool moonlight bathed Qin Sang.</p><p>The bone flute rested on his knees.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless.  At that moment, even the wind seemed to stop, the sea surface became calm and waveless, and Qin Sang seemed to transform into an ancient pine, rooted on this deserted island.</p><p>His thoughts were active, attempting visualization.</p><p>Visualization was the most perplexing aspect of this technique for Qin Sang.</p><p>Demonic cultivators didn't need to worry; they only needed to activate their bloodline and visualize their ancestors.  Their bloodline carried deep imprints of their ancestors.</p><p>Guided by their ancestors, they followed their ancestral path, undergoing transformations, eventually becoming Heavenly Demons.</p><p>As a human, Qin Sang didn't know whom to visualize.</p><p>This was a lost world. Qin Sang didn't even know the true names of Grand Completion stage cultivators, let alone visualize them. Finally, he settled on a target: the Jade Buddha.</p><p>He wasn't sure if this decision was right or wrong; only by trying would he know.</p><p>Within his Purple Mansion, a faint yellow Buddhist light emanated from the surface of his Nascent Soul. The image of the broken-armed Jade Buddha was deeply ingrained in his mind.</p><p>"Jade Buddha…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>He raised his head, opened his eyes, and looked up at the sky.</p><p>Countless stars twinkled in the night sky, infinitely mysterious.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed. Qin Sang imprinted the myriad stars in his mind. Then he closed his eyes, imagining the starlight converging, the stars shifting. Within his consciousness, the image of a golden Buddha gradually emerged.</p><p>Everything was born from his will.</p><p>The "Heavenly Demon Body Refining" stated that when visualization was successful, the bone flute would resonate, helping the cultivator enter the first stage, guiding the absorption of starlight to begin the first step of body tempering.</p><p>At the same time, the bone flute wasn't just a jade slip and a catalyst, as Qin Sang had previously thought.</p><p>The bone flute was likely specifically refined by the great demon who created the technique. Holding the bone flute throughout the cultivation process had a supplementary effect. Although not essential, cultivating without it would be significantly more difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang forgot everything, with only the Jade Buddha in his heart, waiting for the bone flute to respond.</p><p>Cultivation made him oblivious to the passage of time.</p><p>Three days passed in a blink.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered during the day and cultivated at night, never slacking.</p><p>Disappointingly, not only did the bone flute remain unresponsive, but the technique also showed no progress.</p><p>"I've never been troubled by heart demons.  Early in my cultivation, I learned how to eliminate distractions and achieve a state of tranquility. The 'Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter' is no worse than the 'Heavenly Demon Body Refining'. If the requirements are so stringent that even my state of mind can't begin, those demonic beasts with undeveloped intelligence and chaotic minds would have no chance of cultivating…"</p><p>Recalling his experiences over the past few days, Qin Sang identified the problem. "Visualizing the Jade Buddha is not working! Then I can only try the Heavenly Demon…"</p><p>Heavenly Demons were only mentioned in fragments in ancient texts.</p><p>Some ancient texts provided detailed descriptions of renowned sacred beasts and great demons like dragons, phoenixes, and qilin. However, Qin Sang hadn't witnessed these creatures personally.  Visualizing them out of thin air would be difficult to capture their essence.</p><p>The only one he'd seen was the Azure鸾!</p><p>That year, in the chaotic island waters, Granny Jing summoned the Azure鸾 wooden puppet for battle, a scene deeply etched in Qin Sang's memory.</p><p>He remembered Granny Jing mentioning that she had once been fortunate enough to see the true form of the Azure鸾 and personally feel its aura. Although she hadn't encountered the divine beast's true body, her wooden carving perfectly captured the Azure鸾's essence, more vividly than any ancient text.</p><p>At the time, he couldn't detect any flaws, believing it to be a living Azure鸾.</p><p>Visualizing the Azure鸾 was the best choice.</p><p>However, Granny Jing's wooden carving wasn't a true Heavenly Demon, and whether it could activate the bone flute remained uncertain.</p><p>“It's worth a try…”</p><p>Qin Sang had already prepared for this moment.  He had been recalling every detail of his encounter with the Azure鸾, not missing a single aspect.</p><p>The Azure鸾's liveliness when they first met, its divine might wielding Azure Fire during the battle with Yu Shanting, its heroic sacrifice…</p><p>He had already vividly pictured the Azure鸾 in his mind, making visualization surprisingly smooth.</p><p>He focused his intent, imagining the myriad stars radiating brilliant starlight. A majestic Azure鸾 soared through the star sea, gracefully spreading its wings, its feathers covered in Azure flames, like a divine bird bathed in fire.</p><p>Suddenly, the bone flute in his hand moved.</p><p>An immense attractive force seemed to emerge within Qin Sang. The Azure鸾 soaring in the star sea opened its divine eyes, looked at him, and then, with a spread of its wings, flew towards him.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>A roaring wind swept through the visualized starry sky, and Qin Sang felt a sense of suffocation.</p><p>The Azure鸾's speed was astonishing.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could react, the Azure鸾 descended from the sky.</p><p>His thoughts spiraled out of control.  In his imagination, the stars in the sky flickered, sending down slender beams of light from the high heavens, converging with the Azure鸾, descending upon his head, and entering his body through the Baihui acupoint.</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang felt a cool, ethereal power entering his body, followed by an indescribable sense of comfort, surrounded by a gentle breeze, feeling light and airy, intoxicating.</p>
