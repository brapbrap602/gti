<h1>Chapter 1960: No Regrets</h1><p>The Emperor is gravely ill.</p><p>All factions are focused on vying for the throne.</p><p>The turning point, however, comes from an unexpected quarter.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>Yu Lang’s hand trembled, and his teacup shattered on the floor.</p><p>Ignoring the spilled tea, Yu Lang stared intently at the names on the urgent report.</p><p>Qi Prefecture, Ci Zhen Prefecture, Zhongning Prefecture…</p><p>All were prefectural cities in Luzhou Prefecture—the main target of the Da Liang attack!</p><p>And the prefect of Zhongning Prefecture in Luzhou is Chen Zhenqing, Master Chen!</p><p>The mortal world is not like the cultivation world, where there are communication talismans and spells.  War reports are delayed. The Da Liang invasion left several prefectures isolated almost instantly. By the time the news reached the capital, days had passed. No one knows if the Luzhou garrison can withstand this surprise attack, or what the situation in the city is now!</p><p>There are four prefectures bordering Da Liang in Yan.</p><p>While Luzhou has experienced several wars, its strategic importance is not paramount. Logically, Luzhou would not be Da Liang’s first target.</p><p>Therefore, Yan’s military deployment in Luzhou is not the strongest.</p><p>The crown prince, unlike the Emperor, cannot interfere with military affairs; it’s forbidden.  Yu Lang could only secretly arrange for additional troops to be sent to Zhongning Prefecture.</p><p>The Da Liang surprise attack on Luzhou showed no prior warning. Yu Lang, being close to the center of power, didn't receive any intelligence, showing how covert this attack was.</p><p>Caught off guard, how long can Luzhou hold out?</p><p>How long can Zhongning Prefecture hold out?!</p><p>‘Creak!’</p><p>A woman in a pale yellow silk dress opened the door, carrying a soup bowl.</p><p>She is beautiful, poised, and gentle – Yu Lang’s lawfully wedded wife, Miss Mu Yunwan, daughter of the Minister of Rites.</p><p>“Husband, drink your ginseng soup.”</p><p>Mu Yunwan glanced at the broken porcelain, placed the soup down, and spoke softly.  Then she saw Yu Lang’s expression and her heart clenched.</p><p>What a look – apprehension, helplessness, panic, fear…</p><p>No matter how dangerous the court was, her husband always seemed composed. She had never seen this look on his face before.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Mu Yunwan gently took Yu Lang’s hand, trying to soothe him.</p><p>Yu Lang seemed to snap out of a trance. “Is the messenger still outside?”</p><p>Mu Yunwan nodded.</p><p>Yu Lang abruptly stood, quickly removing his official robes, and opened the rear window, leaving through it instead of the main door.</p><p>Just before leaving, Yu Lang turned back, saying, “Tell Tao Teng to wait for me in the study.  I'll go to the East Palace after I return!”</p><p>Even without using his spiritual energy, Yu Lang is a genuine innate expert, his light skills are impeccable.  He left a quick message and disappeared into the night like a nimble cat.</p><p>Mu Yunwan stood by the window, clutching the frame, staring at the dark night, her face full of worry.</p><p>…</p><p>By Jade Waist Lake.</p><p>Qingyang Tea House.</p><p>Yu Lang, having left the Qin residence, hurried here, using his light skills the entire way.</p><p>The urgent message was placed before Xiao Wu.</p><p>Xiao Wu, unlike Yu Lang, was not panicked. After a moment of silence, she said, “Master Chen won't leave.”</p><p>Yu Lang understood his senior sister’s meaning, answering and reassuring himself, “Zhongning Prefecture is a prefectural city. Even if surrounded by enemy forces, it shouldn't fall so quickly…”</p><p>However, they both knew that Da Liang's sudden invasion was surely long-planned, aiming for a decisive victory and maximum gain!</p><p>Besides the major passes, the so-called prefectural cities on the border were not strong, some even rebuilt on the ruins of old cities. Their walls were probably only slightly stronger than those of ordinary counties.</p><p>Yu Lang’s voice was strained, “Master Chen has a protective talisman.”</p><p>“Master Chen won’t leave!”</p><p>Xiao Wu repeated.</p><p>The protective talismans they gave Master Chen were only to prevent accidents and resist spells from cultivators. They could create better ones, but the gods wouldn't allow it.</p><p>Once surrounded by a vast army and facing weapons, a talisman would offer no protection.</p><p>Besides, knowing Chen Zhenqing’s character, he would definitely share the fate of the people!</p><p>“I’m going to Zhongning Prefecture!”</p><p>Xiao Wu pointed at her forehead, a light flashed, with a ‘bang’, a complex rune appeared then shattered, as if breaking a seal. Xiao Wu’s cultivation was fully restored!</p><p>The next moment, Xiao Wu vanished.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The lake water rippled; the night sounds were especially clear, reaching the Qingyang Tea House.</p><p>The room remained dark.</p><p>After Xiao Wu left, Yu Lang sat alone in the darkness.  At this critical juncture of shifting political tides, he remained, unable to leave. His senior sister had gone to Zhongning to rescue people; the intervention of cultivators in mortal affairs was something he had always vehemently opposed. Yet, now, he couldn't, dared not, stop her.  He couldn't bear to watch Master Chen die. Even though he knew that if Master Chen refused to leave and chose to share the fate of Zhongning, his senior sister would undoubtedly intervene and force the Liang army to retreat.  The human world's situation, the destinies of countless people, would be altered by his senior sister alone.</p><p>Yu Lang slowly bowed his head, his hands clasped around his head.  A breeze blew in. A figure appeared beside him – the young man surnamed Shi.  Not only had Yu Lang not stopped his senior sister from saving people, he had also made a backup plan: if his senior sister couldn't break the seal, he would ask Shi to go to Zhongning. After understanding the situation…</p><p>"Still can't figure it out?  Heh, you'll understand later. There are many things in this world that defy understanding!"</p><p>The young man sighed softly, patting Yu Lang on the shoulder. "You should go back! If Master Chen dies on the battlefield, it will be a worthy death.  If you ask, I will kill every soldier of Liang for you. But your involvement in the mortal world would then be meaningless. I think, even in the afterlife, Master Chen would rather see you help the crown prince ascend the throne, strengthen the Yan kingdom, and defeat the Liang kingdom honorably, avenging him!"</p><p>…</p><p>The road was filled with refugees fleeing.  The night was exceptionally dark. The people were exhausted, moving forward listlessly. As long as they had a sliver of strength, they dared not stop. The enemy army was behind them; they could only flee, flee inland.</p><p>Xiao Wu flew in the sky, her gaze scanning the ground.  After arriving in Luzhou, she followed the road to Zhongning, knowing that if Master Chen's family escaped from Zhongning, they would take this route. Then, her spiritual senses detected a familiar presence. Xiao Wu immediately descended.</p><p>By the roadside, a carriage was slowly moving. It wasn't luxurious; the driver was a burly man with a fierce look, clearly not someone to be trifled with. Inside the carriage sat a mother and daughter. The daughter was asleep in her mother's arms. The mother held her daughter, her face pale and tear-stained.  Her body swayed with the carriage, her gaze unfocused, staring blankly at the darkness ahead.  This mother and daughter were Master Chen's wife, Chen Liushi, and their daughter.</p><p>"Mistress!"</p><p>Chen Liushi, unaware of Xiao Wu's sudden appearance, was startled by the call.  Her eyes flickered before she regained her senses. A soft light illuminated the carriage.</p><p>Recognizing Xiao Wu, Chen Liushi's face showed surprise. "Xiao Wu, how did you get here?"</p><p>"Mistress, Master wasn't with you when you left the city?" Xiao Wu had a premonition, but facing the reality, her heart was heavy.</p><p>"He found a chance to send us out of the city, but he refused to leave himself. He vowed to share the fate of the city's people!"</p><p>Chen Liushi hugged her daughter tightly, tears welling up again. Her tone was filled with sadness, yet also with a hint of strength and pride. "He did it. He kept his vow!"</p><p>Xiao Wu fell silent, gazing towards Zhongning. Master Chen's words from that drunken night at Qingyang Temple were vivid in her memory.</p><p>Chen Liushi remembered something, reaching into her bosom and tremblingly taking out a letter. Despite the hardships of their escape, the letter was perfectly preserved, without a single crease.</p><p>"This is Zhenqing's letter for…"</p><p>Xiao Wu took the letter and opened it. It contained only eight words:  "To die with the people, to die without regret!" The ink was slightly smudged, clearly written hastily before the ink dried, yet the powerful conviction and determination were evident in the strong calligraphy.</p><p>"Xiao Wu…" Chen Liushi hesitated. "You… are you… not ordinary people?"</p><p>Xiao Wu's sudden appearance from the capital, even on the fastest horse, was impossible.  Back in Qibai Village, the couple had recognized Qingfeng Daoist as an extraordinary recluse, and his two disciples as exceptional individuals.  But Chen Liushi didn’t know just how extraordinary.</p><p>Seeing Xiao Wu nod in confirmation, Chen Liushi's eyes brightened. "Could you…"</p><p>"I'm going to Zhongning!"</p><p>Xiao Wu placed a protective enchantment on the carriage before flying towards Zhongning.</p><p>With her cultivation, she could have reached the Zhongning Prefecture capital in an instant, but she slowed her pace, as if hesitant, afraid to approach the city.</p><p>Darkness shrouded the land.</p><p>Xiao Wu flew alone, her speed reduced to that of a bird. Finally, she saw the Zhongning Prefecture capital.</p><p>She remembered her last visit.  After years of recuperation, Zhongning had begun to recover, showing signs of prosperity. Now, countless torches illuminated the night sky, but they also lit up the city's ruined walls and the mountains of corpses and rivers of blood!</p><p>Xiao Wu landed on a mountain outside the city.</p><p>Standing there, she silently gazed at the city.</p><p>She clutched the letter left by Master. The paper, fine Xuan paper from Yan, fluttered in the night wind, like a white butterfly dancing in the air.</p><p>Xiao Wu stood motionless, like a statue.</p><p>Within the city, she sensed Master's presence, but it was lifeless.</p><p>She was too late!</p><p>Anger, grief, regret, self-blame, sorrow…</p><p>Xiao Wu couldn't distinguish the multitude of emotions swirling within her. It was too complex, even more so than when she was betrayed by Meng Yu Su. She dared not enter the city to face it.</p><p>What should she do now?</p><p>Revenge?</p><p>Xiao Wu was lost, looking at the eight characters in her hand.</p><p>She could easily slaughter all the Daliang army, but what good would that do?</p><p>This was a conflict between two nations. If she sought a culprit, everyone, from the monarch to the common soldier, could be considered guilty, yet none had personal animosity towards Master Chen.</p><p>Besides, Master Chen had a chance to escape but chose to stay, accepting death.</p><p>He died for his country, for his people, saying he died without regret!</p><p>'Whoosh… whoosh… whoosh…'</p><p>The night wind intensified.</p><p>"Master, what should I do?"</p><p>Xiao Wu stared blankly at the deep night sky, finally moving.  She walked down the mountain.  She didn't use any magical techniques, only concealing her tracks as she walked step by step into the city.</p><p>The city gate was destroyed; the Daliang soldiers showed no intention of repairing it, not planning to stay long.</p><p>Along the roadsides, corpses were piled in heaps, blood flowing like rivers.</p><p>Xiao Wu walked on the path of blood towards the government office.</p><p>The city was unusually boisterous; the Daliang soldiers were celebrating their victory amidst the carnage.</p><p>Xiao Wu's eyes were vacant, as if she hadn't heard the sounds; she unconsciously arrived at the government office.</p><p>One gate of the government office was also broken. The guards didn’t notice a woman passing them and entering.</p><p>In the main hall of the government office…</p><p>A large sand table was set up, displaying the terrain of Luzhou in its entirety.</p><p>Only one person was present, the Daliang general leading the army. He held a candle, carefully examining the sand table, intently studying the battle situation.</p><p>Suddenly, hurried footsteps sounded outside.</p><p>Someone reported at the door, "General, the identities of those corpses have been confirmed."</p><p>The general stood up and said in a deep voice, "Confirmed that it is the Prefect of Zhongning Prefecture, not a substitute?"</p><p>The reply came from outside, "It is indeed! His name is Chen Zhenqing, a man of great prestige in Luzhou!  Master Zuo asks if we should take the body or perhaps decapitate him and display his head at the camp gate to greatly demoralize the enemy!"</p><p>"Although I am in Daliang, I have heard of Chen Zhenqing.  This man loved the people like his own children. During the siege, many officials and nobles escaped.  Yet, he, as the chief official, remained and died on the battlefield with his soldiers. It seems his reputation was well-deserved!  Such virtuous man, his integrity remains even in death, how can we allow anyone to insult him!”</p><p>The general remained silent for a moment, then said in a deep voice, "Give him a proper burial."</p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p>The man outside left.</p><p>…</p><p>The tomb of Chen Zhenqing, Prefect of Zhongning Prefecture, Luzhou, Yan.</p><p>Xiao Wu stood before the tomb, watching the Daliang soldiers erect a tomb for Master Chen.</p><p>She observed the entire process until the soldiers left before revealing herself.</p><p>After paying her respects for a long time, Xiao Wu finished her offerings to Master Chen, her fingers, which had been tightly clutching the letter, gradually relaxed.</p><p>Finally, she meticulously folded the letter, carefully stored it, and then left Zhongning Prefecture.</p><p>Leaving Master Chen in this land might be his best resting place.</p><p>Xiao Wu found her master's wife and, using magic, brought them back to Qipai Village, settling them down.</p><p>She stood at the foot of the mountain, looking at the Qingyang Temple on the mountain, hesitating, but ultimately she didn't go up.  She rose on a white cloud and flew away.</p><p>Above the clouds…</p><p>Xiao Wu looked at the vast land, her eyes still somewhat lost and uncertain, unsure if what she had done was right or wrong.</p><p>Her flight had no direction.</p><p>She hadn't even realized she had deviated from the capital's direction, not knowing where she was flying.</p><p>Suddenly, Xiao Wu's eyes flickered, and she mechanically looked into the distance.  A flicker of emotion finally appeared in her eyes.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>In an instant, she soared over countless mountain ranges and appeared above a mountain basin.</p><p>A moment later, a white shadow suddenly jumped out of the mountain basin, leaping into Xiao Wu's arms, emitting a sound filled with affection and surprise.</p><p>"Yīng yīng…"</p><p>It was a white fox.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Unknowingly, another Spring Festival has arrived.</p><p>Happy New Year to all readers, good luck in the Year of the Dragon, and may you soar to the heavens!</p><p>I am also taking a three-day break to rest and spend time with my family.</p><p>(End)</p>
