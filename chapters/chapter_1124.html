<h1>Chapter 1116: Great Progress in Cultivation</h1><p>Time flies.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang had been in seclusion in Peach Blossom Valley for eighteen years. Fortunately, the cultivation world remained relatively peaceful during this time, allowing Qin Sang to cultivate in tranquility. Aside from occasionally visiting the market to collect resources gathered by the merchant guilds on his behalf, he rarely left the valley.</p><p>A year after Qin Sang entered seclusion, Qing Jun left the valley, her whereabouts becoming elusive, appearing and disappearing like a dragon glimpsed only by its head. Over the years, Qin Sang had only seen her return once, and she left again in haste.</p><p>Li Yufu and the other two disciples sent him messages every year, seeking his guidance. However, Qin Sang was troubled by the fact that Yun Youzi had not sent any news. Hearing from Li Yufu that this was normal for Yun Youzi, Qin Sang felt slightly reassured.</p><p>On one hand, Qin Sang devoted himself wholeheartedly to cultivation for eighteen years. On the other hand, he spent the resources he had brought back from the Canglang Sea lavishly, and his progress naturally advanced by leaps and bounds.</p><p>During these years, Qin Sang focused primarily on cultivating his techniques. He temporarily set aside the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*, not deliberately diverting his attention to comprehend it. With the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* as his foundation, he believed that after successfully forming his Nascent Soul, understanding sword intent and sword formations would come naturally. At that point, comprehending the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture* would be much easier.</p><p>Additionally, the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique had also reached a standstill. After slightly condensing the Fire Lotus Seed, Qin Sang found himself limited by his cultivation level and unable to progress further. Thus, he had to set it aside along with the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*.</p><p>The number of demon banners he could control was related to the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique. The Twelve Demon Banners Formation, which was even more powerful than the *Thunder Control Art*, was currently Qin Sang's strongest trump card.</p><p>With his secret techniques difficult to refine and the Soul Cleansing Liquid completely depleted, Qin Sang had no choice but to seek other methods, such as finding similar pills that could temporarily enhance his divine sense.</p><p>After entering seclusion, Qin Sang quickly regained his previous cultivation level. After careful consideration, he decided to focus primarily on the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* technique, with the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* as a secondary focus, aiming to first bring his physical body to its peak.</p><p>Even during the ten years he spent training in the Demon Sea, Qin Sang had never neglected tempering his physical body. Fortunately, through the various merchant guilds and factions he had commissioned, Qin Sang managed to acquire several spiritual fruits recorded in ancient demonic texts. Although their effects were not as potent as the Tyrant Blood Fruit, they still provided significant benefits. However, their high cost made Qin Sang wince every time he purchased them.</p><p>Thanks to these spiritual fruits and years of rigorous cultivation, Qin Sang's physical body grew increasingly powerful, and the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* technique was nearing the completion of its third layer. Of course, he had not neglected the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, though its progress was slower compared to the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*.</p><p>The true killing talismans did not disappoint him. After breaking through to the late Golden Core stage and successfully inscribing the sixth killing talisman, Qin Sang's cultivation speed had surpassed that of dual-spiritual root geniuses. If he could complete the seventh killing talisman, he would not be far from the prodigies born with heavenly spiritual roots.</p><p>It was precisely this rapid cultivation speed, coupled with the absence of bottlenecks at minor realms, that allowed Qin Sang to balance the cultivation of both techniques.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and his life-bound insect gu had made breakthroughs. The Celestial Eye Butterfly, continuously fed with spiritual medicines, had successfully reached the late stage of its third transformation. Although the improvement was only a minor realm, the changes in the Celestial Eye Butterfly were not immediately noticeable, except for the deeper and more vivid celestial eyes on its wings, which had grown even more powerful. The thunder-controlling ability it had gained from its previous mutation remained unremarkable. Perhaps after completing its fourth transformation, there would be new changes. However, Qin Sang had almost exhausted his supply of Crimson Fire Gold, and he had no idea how to assist the Celestial Eye Butterfly in its fourth transformation.</p><p>Additionally, there were the Fire Jade Centipede and the Fat Silkworm. After consuming the Crimson Fire Gold, the Fire Jade Centipede had not undergone a transformation, though it had grown somewhat closer to Qin Sang. The Fat Silkworm's condition was even more concerning. Qin Sang had initially thought that the Fat Silkworm, like before, had fallen into a deep sleep due to overexertion and would recover after some time. However, even after so long, it remained in a deep slumber within Ya Gu's body, showing no signs of awakening, much like its master. Externally, there were no visible changes. Qin Sang was unsure of the current state of this pair and dared not rashly awaken the Fat Silkworm, choosing instead to patiently wait for it to wake on its own.</p><p>Under the starry night.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the Star Platform, drawing upon the power of the stars to temper his physical body. The star煞 (sha) was blocked by the Jade Buddha and expelled from his body. At this moment, Qin Sang's body transformed into his demonic form, with phoenix wings sprouting from his back. Bathed in the starlight, his body became as translucent as jade, emitting a faint glow. The phoenix wings appeared even more solid, seamlessly integrated with his physical form. To an outsider, it would be hard to imagine that these wings were a manifestation of a divine ability.</p><p>Tiny points of starlight seeped into Qin Sang's body, purging impurities from his flesh and blood, and strengthening his bones and muscles. The cool, ethereal power of the stars, while tempering his body, actually brought Qin Sang a sensation of tearing and pain. However, his physical body was now far more resilient than before, and he remained unmoved.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the glow on Qin Sang's body suddenly dimmed, and the starlight receded like a tide. With a soft exhale, Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state and instinctively clenched his fist.</p><p>"Not bad!" Qin Sang's face showed satisfaction. "Cultivating both body and spirit, every step forward brings a significant improvement... It should only take two more years to reach the peak."</p><p>He retracted his phoenix wings and stood up, glancing toward Bai's cave abode. When Qing Jun had returned to the valley, Bai had emerged from seclusion once to pay his respects. The rest of the time, he had remained in his cave, and Qin Sang had not seen him since. He wondered how Bai's comprehension of the Soul Pearl was progressing.</p><p>"Eighteen years have passed so quickly. From the rumors I've heard in the markets and from the major merchant guilds, the cultivation world is far from stable. It's said that tensions are gradually rising at the borders, and a major conflict could break out at any moment. To get accurate information, I'd have to ask my senior sister, but her whereabouts are so unpredictable..."</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Qin Sang walked out of his cave.</p><p>A crane's cry echoed through the valley.</p><p>A white figure flew to Qin Sang, revealing a majestic immortal crane. During his seclusion, Qin Sang had left the crane outside to tend to the peach forest. He did not restrict the crane's cultivation. If the crane could break through to the late Demon Core stage on its own, Qin Sang would not hesitate to set it free. However, the crane did not seem to share the same lofty aspirations as the two-headed 暾 (tun), showing no strong desire to escape his control. Its only grievance was being confined to the valley, forbidden from venturing outside. It could not go out to flirt with other birds, nor could Qin Sang find it a mate.</p><p>The crane landed in front of Qin Sang, rolling around and scratching its head in frustration.</p><p>"This is a cultivator's territory. Aren't you afraid of being caught, plucked, and roasted for food?" Qin Sang scolded it lightly. "Enough nonsense! Have there been any recent news?"</p><p>The crane hung its head, letting out a mournful cry, then wobbled back to its nest, gazing blankly at the vast blue sky.</p><p>Qin Sang nearly laughed in exasperation.</p><p>Just as he was about to return to his cave to continue cultivating, the valley's protective formation suddenly rippled.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, and he flashed out of Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Standing outside was none other than Li Yufu.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Li Yufu bowed respectfully and said with joy, "Uncle-Master, the Grandmaster has returned! Upon learning of your safe return, the Grandmaster was overjoyed. She wanted to come see you personally, but due to an urgent need to enter seclusion, she couldn't leave. Instead, she sent me to invite you over!"</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted upon hearing this.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p>
