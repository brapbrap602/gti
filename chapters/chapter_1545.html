<h1>Chapter 1536: The Moonlight Bodhisattva (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1536: The Moonlight Bodhisattva (4k)</p><p>“How long have you been at Jiuga Mountain, Fairy?”</p><p>Qin Sang rose to greet her.</p><p>“Three months.”</p><p>Liuli walked in, removing her cloak.</p><p>Her cloak was very large, concealing not only her face, but also her graceful figure.  This attire was somewhat unusual in Buddhist territory, but Jiuga Mountain was a mixed bag, so it didn't seem so out of place.</p><p>This was because she had encountered some unruly thugs while traveling through the Northern Wasteland.</p><p>In the cultivation world, not every cultivator possesses sufficient self-control, and exceptional beauty can easily attract trouble.</p><p>Liuli, like Qin Sang, always favored a low-key approach, never revealing her true cultivation unless necessary.</p><p>Even the great reputations of Xuantian Palace and Tingxue Tower couldn't reach the Central Plains, let alone deter petty criminals.</p><p>Liuli killed them all with a single sword, but to avoid further trouble, she simply put on the cloak, and things were indeed much quieter afterwards.</p><p>“Three months, exactly the time I was delayed at the Sky-裂 Valley…”</p><p>Qin Sang invited Liuli to sit down and briefly recounted her previous experiences.</p><p>“Sky-裂 Valley isn't far from the Nineteen Rain-swept States, a perfect location, but unfortunately, the cave abode was destroyed. I rescued a Golden Core cultivator on the way and sent him to the Nineteen Rain-swept States to scout for information. Once I get the Buddha Bone Relic, I’ll go there personally. If Xiaoxiangzi’s records are correct, and I’m lucky, I might have a chance to take over a top-tier Daoist sect…”</p><p>The Nineteen Rain-swept States were indeed a cultivation holy land, but as far as Qin Sang knew, all the prominent mountains and rivers were already occupied.</p><p>It wasn't a time of chaos.  Various factions were intertwined, with complex relationships and mutual support.</p><p>Seizing someone else's mountain gate was obviously impossible and would invite the wrath of everyone.</p><p>Furthermore, there were Nascent Soul cultivators stationed in the Central Plains.  Their strength was far from sufficient for them to act recklessly.</p><p>To gain a foothold in the Central Plains, one either had to attach themselves to a sect or choose a location in the Northern Wasteland, Western Desert, or overseas immortal mountains to establish a cave abode.</p><p>However, if the cave abode was too remote, far from the center of the cultivation world, information couldn't be transmitted promptly.  If something major happened, by the time they received news and arrived in the Central Plains, it would already be over.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was not only self-cultivation but also gathering information and seeking opportunities for Nascent Soul advancement.</p><p>He directly mentioned the cave abode to Liuli, implicitly inviting her to join him. Liuli was not only a powerful helper but also, most importantly, trustworthy.</p><p>She came for the Buddha Bone Relic, unlike Qin Sang who was entangled in various karmic entanglements. Her main tasks were cultivation and investigating the mystery of the Purple Micro Palace's ascension; it didn't matter much where she was.</p><p>Liuli hesitated, neither confirming nor denying.</p><p>Qin Sang, familiar with Liuli's nature, didn't mind.  He recalled his discovery while climbing the mountain, "Has something happened on Jiuga Mountain? Those Buddhist cultivators seemed rather strange?"</p><p>Liuli hummed, saying, "A month ago, the Moonlight Bodhisattva arrived here and set up an altar on Jiuga Mountain, attracting many monks to debate with her."</p><p>“Bodhisattva?”</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback.</p><p>Buddhism revered Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.</p><p>Could someone be carrying the temple's Moonlight Bodhisattva statue around?</p><p>Liuli shook her head, "The Moonlight Bodhisattva is said to be from the deep desert, well-versed in Buddhist scriptures, with profound cultivation, and self-proclaimed ‘Bodhisattva.’ She claimed that unless someone could defeat her in debate, she would not change her title, hence the debate a month ago."</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators in Buddhism were only titled Saints, such as the current Hui Guang Saint of Ganlu Monastery.</p><p>To dare to use the title ‘Bodhisattva’ was clearly presumptuous!</p><p>A debate was the least of their worries.</p><p>If that person was attacked on Jiuga Mountain, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.</p><p>In the depths of the Western Desert, where people were few and far between and news was scarce, using such titles was fine; no one would care. But to dare to act so brazenly on Jiuga Mountain – she really wasn't afraid of attracting Buddhist Saints!</p><p>“What was the outcome of the debate?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>Liuli hesitated, “I'm not well-versed in Buddhist scriptures… The debate lasted three days, after which the monks were speechless, and the Moonlight Bodhisattva left calmly; no one dared to stop her.”</p><p>“Since she has the courage to call herself a ‘Bodhisattva,’ she must have the ability.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Those monks must have rushed over to help after receiving news, but the Moonlight Bodhisattva was no longer on Jiuga Mountain.</p><p>Xuelian Mountain was known as the origin of Buddhism, more as a spiritual sanctuary; the top Buddhist sects weren't there, but rather in the Central Plains.</p><p>Three days of debate, and once the news spread, she left.</p><p>This person must have been wary.</p><p>"I've gathered a lot of information from the many Buddhist disciples who've flocked here recently," said Liuli, producing a sheepskin map.  She unfolded it on the table, pointing to a spot in the desert. "The Buddha bone relic is likely here – the Seven Lakes of the瀚海."</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted.</p><p>"Thank you, fairy!" he exclaimed, leaning in to examine the map.  Liuli's finger indicated a large oasis, actually seven separate oases arranged in a line across the desert, not far from each other. Each oasis showed a prominent lake symbol.</p><p>The map was quite simple, containing only this information. Liuli explained: "The western desert is not uniform; its situation is ever-changing, with many kingdoms. Western desert cultivators divide the area based on characteristics, like the Snow-Covered Mountains and the瀚海.  These seven lakes never dry up, nourishing the oases like stars in the desert. Later, Buddhist monks built temples by the lakes, so ‘Seven Lakes of the瀚海’ also refers to these seven temples, closely linked and the dominant power in the region.  My investigation suggests that originally, there were many oases and lakes here. They gradually merged, leaving only these seven large ones, consistent with Senior Xiao Xiangzi's records."</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes scanned the seven temples on the map.  "There's no Yin Chan Temple?" he asked, puzzled.  Senior Xiao Xiangzi had mentioned that the relic was formed from the remains of an enlightened monk from Yin Chan Temple.</p><p>Liuli explained her reasoning: "There were no temples here originally. Legend says a great monk came here alone, seeing the people's lack of faith, and built a temple to spread Buddhism – that temple was Yin Chan Temple.  Later, great turmoil struck the瀚海, and Yin Chan Temple disappeared for unknown reasons, but more temples were built, indicating the triumph of Buddhism. If Yin Chan Temple's lineage ended, its treasures likely ended up in these seven temples."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent. The world is ever-changing; even a slight difference can lead to vastly different outcomes.  Even if Liuli’s guess is correct, there’s a chance that Yin Chan Temple had survivors who escaped, taking the treasures with them. Finding them would be extremely difficult.</p><p>Liuli stated, "Whether this is the same Yin Chan Temple needs verification in the瀚海."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded gravely. "We should leave immediately."</p><p>An unspoken worry hung between them. Stealing the relic from Yin Chan Temple meant facing the temple's experts. Now, they might face seven powerful temples at once!  But that was a concern for later; they would deal with it once they found the relic.</p><p>Liuli had spent three months in the Snow-Covered Mountains and had gathered all available information.  They left the mountain the next morning.  The number of Buddhist monks increased dramatically as they descended. The repercussions of the Moonlight Bodhisattva's actions were still unfolding.</p><p>Beyond the Ji Jia Mountain, the desert began; hot, dry air formed visible heat waves. The western desert was dangerous, but not comparable to a storm. The Ten Directions Earth-Opening Shuttle could easily handle it. While harsh, this area was the most fertile part of the western desert. Meltwater from the Snow-Covered Mountains fed several streams and underground rivers to the south, bringing life to the desert. Many settlements thrived along these waterways, forming countless kingdoms, most devoted to Buddhism, known as the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms.  The瀚海 lay south of them, not the deepest part of the desert. Westward lay the true death desert.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli journeyed onward, gathering information along the way, passing through numerous kingdoms and experiencing various cultures.</p><p>Nearing the edge of the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms, they learned something about the Moonlight Bodhisattva. After the three-day debate at Ji Jia Mountain, the Bodhisattva vanished, sought by many but never found.  Ten days earlier, however, the Bodhisattva reappeared in a Buddhist kingdom, again challenging monks in a public debate.  But the monks there were no match for the Bodhisattva, and were defeated quickly. This continued provocation enraged the Buddhist community, stirring even many ordinary monks.</p><p>Regardless of the Buddhist sect's response, Qin Sang and Liuli directly traversed the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms, crossed the desert, and entered the vast瀚海 (Hanhai).</p><p>The Seven Stars of Hanhai are located deep within Hanhai.</p><p>They did not directly approach the Seven Stars, instead settling in a market town on the edge of an oasis.</p><p>Only then did they learn that the seven oases housed not only seven Buddhist temples, but hundreds more, excluding those built by ordinary monks and laity.</p><p>This shows the extent of Buddhism's prosperity in the Western Desert.</p><p>Liuli remained cloaked, while Qin Sang, disguised as a lay Buddhist, wore a simple robe and a wide-brimmed hat.</p><p>Hanhai is prone to sandstorms. The wind whipped up sand, stinging their faces like knives. The locals wore similar attire.</p><p>"Creak."</p><p>Qin Sang opened the inn door to find Liuli already back.  They had just separated to gather information.</p><p>"I've obtained a list of the many Buddhist temples in Hanhai,"</p><p>Qin Sang closed the door softly. "Including secular temples. I skimmed it; there's no Yin Chan Temple. We need to verify separately. Some larger temples seem to have cultivators; we can start with them, and subtly make contact with the Seven Stars."</p><p>Liuli offered a guess: "During the great upheaval, Yin Chan Temple might have simply ceased its practices, with the lay monks changing the temple's name to avoid disaster."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment. "Possible, but that means we have to visit every temple."</p><p>"I'll go."</p><p>Liuli stated.</p><p>Qin Sang understood her meaning.</p><p>The Seven Stars of Hanhai undoubtedly have Yuan Ying stage cultivators. However, since their reputation spread, no force has dared to challenge the seven temples' status.</p><p>Their current strength is difficult to estimate.</p><p>It's unlikely they have any great cultivators.</p><p>Middle Kingdom's Nascent Soul cultivators are elusive; late-stage Yuan Ying remains among the world's top experts.</p><p>In the Buddhist world, once a high monk breaks through to the late Yuan Ying stage, a grand water and land ceremony is traditionally held to celebrate, inviting fellow practitioners.</p><p>According to their investigations, the Seven Stars have never held such a ceremony.</p><p>Qin Sang's spiritual sense was subtly concealed; cultivators below the late Yuan Ying stage couldn't see through his cultivation unless they used detection techniques directly.  He was the safest choice to approach the cultivators.</p><p>Liuli was less capable.</p><p>"Good."</p><p>Qin Sang produced the list, and they divided the temples into two categories, assigning each other tasks.</p><p>...</p><p>After separating, Qin Sang began his solitary journey through the oases, openly and secretly investigating the temples.</p><p>Rushing could arouse suspicion, so he acted as a devout lay Buddhist, slowing his progress.</p><p>Bei Shan Temple.</p><p>One of the Seven Stars of Hanhai, ranked sixth.</p><p>Qin Sang had already visited Deng Ci Temple, the lowest ranked, but failed to meet the abbot, only interacting with a few low-cultivation young novices, learning nothing valuable.</p><p>Neither Bei Shan nor Deng Ci Temples had Yuan Ying cultivators; the abbots were reportedly only at the late Golden Core stage.</p><p>However, the temples' formations were sophisticated, clearly crafted by a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>After observing for a long time, Qin Sang determined that he couldn't infiltrate unnoticed. He patiently searched for another approach.</p><p>Bei Shan Temple was located by a lake and welcomed laypeople.</p><p>Many people visited the temple.</p><p>Qin Sang behaved normally, joining the queue of worshippers.</p><p>He didn't reveal his cultivation, but his years of cultivation were evident in his demeanor, setting him apart from the crowd. The welcoming monk noticed him.</p><p>Offering incense, bowing, listening to the scriptures...</p><p>Qin Sang was very familiar with these procedures.</p><p>After absently listening to the sermon, Qin Sang rose with the other worshippers.  He was about to call a novice to find a pretext to explore the temple when he felt a sudden intuition.</p><p>Moments later.</p><p>A monk approached from afar, unnoticed by the other worshippers.</p><p>"Amitabha, may I speak with you, sir?"</p><p>The monk walked directly to Qin Sang, hands clasped, bowing.</p><p>"Junior disciple greets the Abbot."</p><p>Qin Sang returned the bow, recognizing the late Golden Core cultivator as the abbot of Bei Shan Temple, inwardly pleased with his effortless success.</p><p>Both recognized each other as cultivators and dispensed with formalities, exchanging Dharma names.</p><p>The abbot's Dharma name was Seng Yan.</p><p>Qin Sang used his previous story, claiming to have been raised by a monk as a child, given the name Mingyue, and meant to be ordained, but due to a temple incident, he became a wanderer.</p><p>Though he encountered the path of cultivation, he committed countless sins, and now, upon reflection, he repented and vowed to travel far and wide, worshipping ten thousand Buddhas to atone.</p><p>Qin Sang was invited by the Abbot to a secluded hall.</p>
