<h1>Chapter 340: The Celestial Corpse Talisman</h1><p>Qin Sang carefully stored the remaining two Soul-Attracting Grass leaves.  He then channeled a stream of spiritual energy to envelop one leaf, simultaneously activating a secret technique from the *Celestial Yin Corpse Scripture*.</p><p>Surging currents of spiritual energy, like rushing rivers, converged before him, forming countless mystical runes. The radiant glow of the spiritual energy illuminated the cave dwelling.</p><p>Finally, these runes coalesced, and at the very center of the spiritual energy, a faint, dark light appeared.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was a flickering flame.</p><p>The flame gradually grew larger, becoming a fist-sized blaze. The runes seemed to transform into a furnace, with Qin Sang's spiritual energy as fuel.</p><p>The flames remained a dark black, burning before Qin Sang. Yet, instead of heat, he felt a chilling aura emanating from the flames.</p><p>This was the Yin Fire, conjured by the secret technique of the *Celestial Yin Corpse Scripture*, specifically used to refine the Soul-Attracting Grass.</p><p>Maintaining the Yin Fire consumed spiritual energy rapidly. However, Qin Sang, already at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, felt little strain and had no fear of his spiritual energy depleting mid-process.</p><p>He observed the Yin Fire and then the Soul-Attracting Grass. After a moment of contemplation, instead of immediately adding the grass, he focused on manipulating the flames.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's control, the circular flames began to shift, sometimes elongating, sometimes compressing.</p><p>Initially, the transformations were slow, and Qin Sang furrowed his brow slightly, feeling the effort. Gradually, the changes became faster, the flames morphing into various animals, vivid and lifelike, as Qin Sang's expression eased.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>With a gesture, Qin Sang cast the Soul-Attracting Grass into the Yin Fire.</p><p>The flames abruptly expanded, completely engulfing the grass. Tiny flames began to lick at the leaves.</p><p>An hour passed quickly. The Soul-Attracting Grass remained nestled within the Yin Fire. Aside from a slight dimming of its surface sheen, there appeared to be no other changes.</p><p>Qin Sang's face remained calm, devoid of any anxiety.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on his wooden bed, eyes closed, his entire being focused on the flames before him, his mind utterly still.</p><p>As time passed, the first crack finally appeared on the Soul-Attracting Grass. More cracks followed, becoming dense, as if the grass would shatter at the slightest touch.</p><p>Indeed, without any external force, the Soul-Attracting Grass crumbled.</p><p>More accurately, it melted, transforming into a pool of black spiritual liquid.</p><p>The Soul-Attracting Grass was finally refined by the Yin Fire!</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly sighed in relief, but he couldn't relax yet. Refining the Soul-Attracting Grass was just the beginning.  He still needed to purify the impurities within the spiritual liquid, leaving only the essence.</p><p>Under the scorching heat of the Yin Fire, the volume of the spiritual liquid gradually decreased.  Originally the size of a baby's fist, it now shrunk to a single drop, its color deepening.</p><p>Ink-black.</p><p>From start to finish, this process lasted three full days. Finally, it was complete!</p><p>The impurities in the Soul-Attracting Grass were purged, but its inherent纹路remained intact. This was crucial for the subsequent crafting of the Celestial Corpse Talisman. This step demanded extreme precision and control from the crafter. A single lapse in concentration could ruin the entire process.</p><p>Withdrawing the Yin Fire, Qin Sang opened his eyes, gazing at the drop of liquid.  Fatigue tinged his gaze, but excitement dominated. He hadn't expected to succeed on his first attempt at the most challenging step of creating a Celestial Corpse Talisman.</p><p>After a brief rest to recover some spiritual energy, Qin Sang immediately continued the process.</p><p>The liquid droplet hovered before him. With a serious expression, Qin Sang cleared his mind, raised his hands, and began forming hand seals.  His fingers danced with increasing speed, leaving blurs in the air, a dazzling display.</p><p>As his hand seals changed, countless mystical runes materialized and were instantly imbued into the spiritual liquid.</p><p>The liquid seemed to come alive, writhing and pulsating. Its black color began to fade, becoming lighter, while its shape grew more defined.</p><p>Finally, a rectangular Celestial Corpse Talisman began to take form!</p><p>However, this wasn't the end.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his hand seals, simultaneously splitting a sliver of his primordial spirit, quickly condensing it into a spiritual imprint, which he embedded into the talisman.</p><p>Success!</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled deeply, his face slightly pale. More than half of his spiritual energy was depleted, highlighting the difficulty of crafting a Celestial Corpse Talisman.</p><p>The talisman was no longer black but a translucent gray.</p><p>Thin as paper, it resembled gray jade, only the size of a thumb, radiating an aura of mystique, with shimmering light flowing across its surface in a specific pattern.</p><p>Like a celestial river in the night sky, faint yet mesmerizing.</p><p>Qin Sang held the weightless Celestial Corpse Talisman in his palm, examining it closely.</p><p>Outwardly so beautiful, yet it was an object of extreme Yin and evil, used to create living corpses.</p><p>This contrast made Qin Sang contemplate in silence.</p><p>He didn't rush to create a living corpse. Instead, he retrieved a jade box and stored the first Celestial Corpse Talisman within, preparing to strike while the iron was hot and craft another.</p><p>"That wasn't so hard…" he muttered to himself, feeling confident.</p><p>However, his complacency was short-lived. The second talisman failed.</p><p>The failure wasn't due to carelessness.</p><p>Failure was, in fact, normal. Crafting a Celestial Corpse Talisman was incredibly difficult. Qin Sang's initial success was partially due to luck.</p><p>Understanding this, Qin Sang felt no discouragement. He dispersed the remnants of the Soul-Attracting Grass, analyzed the cause of failure, and began working on the third talisman.</p><p>Three days later, another Celestial Corpse Talisman was complete!</p><p>Two talismans from one Soul-Attracting Grass. Qin Sang was quite satisfied.  These three attempts provided valuable experience, boosting his confidence in future success.</p><p>Crafting the talismans alone took eight days.</p><p>Estimating Yun Youzi's imminent arrival, Qin Sang paused his work. He retrieved the prepared corpse embryo from his Corpse Puppet Pouch.</p><p>According to the *Celestial Yin Corpse Scripture*, living corpses and煞尸differed significantly, and the Celestial Corpse Talisman was only one requirement.</p><p>Since a living corpse's energy center was intact, not depleted, the Five Elements foundation required a greater quantity of Five Elements Yin objects and Earthly煞energy.</p><p>The precise amount varied based on individual circumstances but was at least several times that required for a煞尸.</p><p>While expensive, Five Elements Yin objects weren't difficult to acquire, and Qin Sang was well-stocked.</p><p>Earthly煞energy, however, was running low.</p><p>Earthly煞energy was an extremely Yin substance, feared even by Foundation Establishment cultivators. It was rarely used in crafting, except for certain ancient, specialized artifacts.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang had encountered a few Yin-rich locations in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield but none like the Earth Sinkhole in Mount Shaohua.</p><p>His supply of Earthly煞energy had been dwindling, with no means of replenishment.  Failed attempts at creating煞尸further depleted his reserves. Now, he only had three bottles left.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the three Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottles, pondering.</p><p>If his Earthly煞energy proved insufficient, it was time to return to Mount Shaohua.</p>
