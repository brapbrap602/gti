<h1>Chapter 1440: The Great Sage Tianpeng</h1><p>Leaving Demon Mixing Island, Tan Hao flew for a while before encountering Qin Sang, who had come to greet him.  Relieved, Tan Hao followed Qin Sang to an underwater reef.</p><p>Entering the water, Tan Hao looked around, sensing something unusual.</p><p>“I’ve set up a large formation here, but it’s not finished yet. I’m short on some materials to refine the array components,” Qin Sang explained briefly, taking the pouch Tan Hao offered. Opening it, he saw it filled with spiritual materials.</p><p>Most were for the Ascension Ceremony.</p><p>He had bought three of each kind, nearly depleting his savings.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet decided whether to help the fat silkworm ascend, but it was better to be prepared.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tan Hao hadn't been able to find the three most crucial materials for the Ascension Ceremony, nor had he found any information about them in Wanmo City, demonstrating their rarity.</p><p>He would have to wait for tomorrow's trade fair.</p><p>If he couldn't buy them, Qin Sang would have to go to Hundred Flowers Valley and trade with them using his Myriad Spirit Fruits.</p><p>Putting away the pouch, Qin Sang said, “I’ll take you to Low Tide Island first. It’s under the Chamber of Commerce’s control and very safe. Wait for me there. If I don’t return within three days, go back to the cave.”</p><p>Tan Hao’s heart skipped a beat. He looked at the formation Qin Sang had set up, his expression changing slightly.  “It’s dangerous?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. “Just in case. Nothing major will happen.”</p><p>Tan Hao hummed in agreement, silently following Qin Sang, flying an unknown distance until they reached Low Tide Island.</p><p>After seeing Tan Hao off, Qin Sang returned to the reef, taking out the materials Tan Hao had bought.  One by one, array components formed in his palm, completing the formation.</p><p>This formation had a simple purpose and an ordinary name: the Maze Formation.</p><p>Unlike common low-level maze formations, this one was created by a senior member of the Yuan Shen Gate, a master of formations, who had deciphered an ancient incomplete formation.</p><p>This formation could trap a Nascent Soul cultivator, but it lacked offensive power. It required significant time to set up beforehand, and the array components would self-destruct after a single use.</p><p>Qin Sang's purpose in setting up the formation wasn’t to kill. If the situation turned unfavorable, he would use the Maze Formation to delay his opponent and escape.</p><p>This was the lair of the Old Man Hunmo; it wasn't suitable for a prolonged fight.</p><p>Of course, if a chance to kill presented itself, he wouldn't miss it.</p><p>Since deciding to bring the mysterious ice box to the Wanmo Assembly to probe the Xuan Tian Palace, Qin Sang, in addition to improving his own strength, had prepared the Maze Formation and the Dan Ding Mountain as backups, ensuring his safety.</p><p>As the last array component was refined and placed into the formation,</p><p>a faint ripple silently appeared on the reef. Qin Sang leaped into the air, looking down. He saw the reef flicker before returning to normal.</p><p>He withdrew his gaze, glanced in the direction of Demon Mixing Island, sat back down on the reef, and waited for the trade fair to begin.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>Before dawn, Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, put on his mask, added a layer of spiritual energy shielding, and flew towards Demon Mixing Island.</p><p>He encountered several cultivators along the way.</p><p>The low-level cultivators, sensing the aura Qin Sang emitted, hastily avoided him.</p><p>Before long,</p><p>Qin Sang saw the outline of the island on the horizon. It was indeed quite large, with a large number of ordinary people and cultivators.</p><p>“Does Old Man Hunmo consider this hiding in plain sight?”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Old Man Hunmo's compound, suppressing his aura, dismissing the thought. Suddenly, he felt something, paused slightly, and turned towards the west.</p><p>A short time later, a black rainbow streaked across the sky.</p><p>Only then did the person within the black rainbow notice Qin Sang. The rainbow stopped, revealing a figure in a wide black robe and a bone mask, a cultivator at the early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The person, sensing Qin Sang's gaze, became secretly alert.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to him, indicating that he had no hostile intent, marveling at the benefits of powerful spiritual sense.</p><p>Their eyes met briefly, and they were about to enter Demon Mixing Island.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang seemed to sense something else, his expression suddenly changing. He abruptly looked up towards the north of Demon Mixing Island, and without a word, dashed into a nearby forest.</p><p>The person in the bone mask, noticing Qin Sang’s unusual behavior, was startled. He subconsciously followed his gaze towards the north, his eyes twitching violently.</p><p>A dark cloud had appeared in the north, seemingly from nowhere.</p><p>The sky was clear, the stars were sparse, and this cloud was quite unnatural. The cloud seemed slow but was rapidly approaching, its target clearly Demon Mixing Island.</p><p>As the cloud neared, the northern mountain of Demon Mixing Island suddenly erupted in a burst of light, illuminating half the sky. Then, a figure slowly appeared in mid-air.</p><p>It was Old Man Hunmo.</p><p>As soon as the figure appeared...</p><p>A piercing, long laugh echoed from the dark clouds.  Instantly, the clouds gathered, forming the ghostly silhouette of a colossal bird with immense, cloud-like wings.</p><p>Several powerful figures stood upon these wings, their expressions varying—some apprehensive, others wary—as they gazed at the Old Demon of the Immortal Mountain.</p><p>Demonic energy soared into the heavens!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The laughter ceased abruptly, the phantom bird dissolving.  Before the assembled demon kings, a man appeared, clad in golden robes and an imperial crown.  His gaze was sharp as an arrow, his nose hooked.  He stood in mid-air, hands behind his back, exuding an air of authority without needing to speak.</p><p>His aura was on par with the Old Demon's.  "Old Demon, what is the meaning of this?  Do you not welcome me to the Great Demon Assembly?"</p><p>"Great Saint Tianpeng's arrival graces Demon Island; how could I not welcome you? I merely feared my subordinates' ignorance might offend you, so I came in person to ensure your comfort," replied the Old Demon, his voice calm but his tone heavy.</p><p>Great Saint Tianpeng chuckled.  "The assembly was supposed to be seven years hence, yet it's been brought forward.  Luckily, I successfully cultivated that technique; I almost missed it."</p><p>The Old Demon, without inquiring about the technique, personally escorted them into Demon City.</p><p>In the forest,</p><p>Qin Sang, concealing his aura, observed from afar, thoughtfully murmuring, "So this is the Great Saint Tianpeng, in his final transformation stage.  Truly a demon king worthy of his reputation.  A formidable opponent. I never expected him to be drawn to the Great Demon Assembly.  Good. The Old Demon is distracted by the Great Saint; the more chaotic the situation, the better."</p><p>After watching the Old Demon and the Great Saint enter the city, Qin Sang calmly emerged from the forest and slowly flew towards Demon City.</p><p>Upon entering the city, Qin Sang sensed something amiss.</p><p>The name and reputation preceded him.</p><p>Great Saint Tianpeng's presence weighed heavily on the cultivators, despite the greater number of human Nascent Soul cultivators within Demon City, despite it being the Old Demon's domain.</p><p>In the heart of Demon City,</p><p>a lake surprisingly existed. The trading fair was located on an island in the center of this lake.  A light mist drifted across the surface, obscuring the view.</p><p>Guards stood watch.</p><p>Qin Sang moved swiftly to the lakeshore.  Numerous gazes fell upon him. Sensing his Nascent Soul aura, the guards, without a word, parted to make way, all kneeling in obeisance.</p><p>Then, the mist parted, revealing a luminous bridge leading to the island. A beautiful woman stood respectfully at the bridge's head.</p>
