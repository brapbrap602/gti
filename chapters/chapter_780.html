<h1>Chapter 772: Strange Creatures</h1><p>Flying Yaksha ventured deep into the Ghostlands.  Aside from inadvertently disturbing some vengeful spirits, it encountered no particularly powerful ghosts.</p><p>This space was vast, with mountains of corpses. Countless ancient cultivators had perished here, their souls imprisoned, their minds lost, becoming vengeful spirits, eternally doomed.</p><p>However, the Ghostlands had boundaries.</p><p>Flying Yaksha reached the end, touching a sheer cliff.</p><p>The piles of bones and broken swords and armor spoke of a once-terrible battle.</p><p>Otherwise, there were no obvious anomalies.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered Flying Yaksha to continue its search to one side, then left the area shrouded in demonic fire.</p><p>He vanished into the ghost mist, appearing before a small pile of bones. With a flick of his finger, he sent out a gust of energy.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>A skeleton was struck by the gust and shattered instantly.</p><p>Alarmed by Qin Sang, several white figures surged from the pile, attacking him. These vengeful spirits opened their mouths wide, their cries filled with extreme resentment.</p><p>Sensing the life force emanating from Qin Sang, they were even more frenzied than those Flying Yaksha had encountered before, craving his flesh.</p><p>Facing the clawing spirits, Qin Sang remained impassive. He snorted coldly, reached out, and grasped forward.</p><p>True Qi erupted from his palm, surging out madly, forming a pocket that enveloped all the spirits, then suddenly tightened.</p><p>The spirits instinctively felt something was wrong, but were powerless against Qin Sang.  Wrapped in his True Qi, they were compressed into a fist-sized ball of ghostly energy.</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned, and the ghostly energy fell into his palm.</p><p>The spirits screamed incessantly; pale ghostly faces appeared one after another within the ball, their mouths agape, their eyes vacant, their expressions grotesquely twisted.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the spirits coldly; their screams had no effect on him.</p><p>After a moment's thought, his eyes changed, and he softly commanded, “Condense!”</p><p>His True Qi surged; mysterious and eerie restrictions appeared. In an instant, under the influence of the restrictions, his True Qi turned black, incredibly sinister.</p><p>At the same time, the black True Qi began to compress inward.</p><p>The spirits inside emitted pained screams, their expressions becoming even more terrifying, but they were utterly helpless.</p><p>Qin Sang was using the secret technique he'd obtained from Yi Tiannie, attempting to refine soul threads. This technique was derived from demonic and ghost-cultivation techniques; cruel and evil.</p><p>Unlike in the Xiong Mountain region, after being refined by this evil technique, these vengeful spirits left nothing behind; their spirituality was already lost, making reincarnation impossible.</p><p>The spirits vanished, and in Qin Sang's palm appeared a segment of soul thread, like a living thing, coiling around his finger.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face lit up.  “The vengeful spirits here can indeed be used to refine soul threads.  Unfortunately, soul threads need to be attached to a banner pole to last. The pole isn’t ready yet, so I'll have to wait until my next visit to the Seven Killing Hall to continue refining them. Still, this is a huge surprise. Based on Flying Yaksha’s exploration, there are a vast number of vengeful spirits here; refining ten or more Ten Directions Yama Banners is entirely possible. After leaving, I can focus on preparing the spirit array to refine the Xuan iron pillars…”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang dispersed the soul thread and chose the direction opposite to Flying Yaksha, intending to thoroughly explore every corner of the Ghostlands to prevent any accidents.</p><p>Next time, he'd focus solely on refining soul threads, without distractions.</p><p>Qin Sang and Flying Yaksha searched separately, one left and one right. Qin Sang unleashed his corpse pill, shrouding himself in corpse energy to mask his life force, allowing him to blend perfectly into the ghost mist.</p><p>After a thorough search, Qin Sang was completely reassured.</p><p>This place was safe, containing only vengeful spirits—an ideal location for refining soul threads.</p><p>He ordered Flying Yaksha to return and decided to leave the Purple Mist Wasteland and head to the Heavenly Tower. Time was ample; he could thoroughly search the Heavenly Tower for ancient teleportation arrays.</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure flickered as he dashed toward the exit of the Ghostlands.</p><p>Flying Yaksha also hurried back.</p><p>It moved swiftly and effortlessly through the ghost mist.</p><p>The grayish-white mist was parted by Flying Yaksha, creating a passage.  Behind it, the mist surged, as if countless ghostly figures were flickering faintly.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang, almost back at the entrance to the Ghostlands, suddenly changed expression, stopped abruptly, and turned to look in the direction of the Flying Night Rakshasa!</p><p>Immediately, without hesitation, he activated the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman and Sword Escape within the Ghostlands.  His escaping light broke through the ghostly fog at an astonishing speed, rushing away and disturbing countless vengeful spirits.</p><p>In a short while, Qin Sang appeared in a clearing, his face ashen as he looked at the empty ground.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa was nowhere to be found!</p><p>A moment before, Qin Sang had sensed the Flying Night Rakshasa being attacked.</p><p>The attack came very suddenly. The enemy was silent and unseen, appearing from behind and closing in without the Flying Night Rakshasa noticing, before striking.</p><p>Due to the distance, Qin Sang couldn't issue a command in time.  The creature could only rely on its instincts to react to the unexpected.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa fought back fiercely. The enemy's strength didn't seem particularly strong; it couldn't subdue the Rakshasa instantly.</p><p>But then, something strange happened.  For no apparent reason, the Flying Night Rakshasa inexplicably gave up resisting and was dragged away by some unknown force deep into the ghostly fog, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Even more shockingly, during the dragging process, Qin Sang's connection with the Flying Night Rakshasa rapidly became blurry, until he completely lost all contact.</p><p>His connection to the Rakshasa was based on a soul mark within the creature, implying that the mark had been obscured or erased.</p><p>This unexpected event came without warning, catching Qin Sang off guard. Through the Rakshasa, he only sensed a vague shadow; he didn't even see the opponent's appearance.</p><p>Upon noticing the anomaly, Qin Sang immediately rushed to the rescue, but it was too late. The Flying Night Rakshasa had been dragged into the ghostly fog and vanished.</p><p>The place was desolate and deathly silent.</p><p>"What is lurking in the shadows?"</p><p>Qin Sang's face was filled with anger.</p><p>He and the Flying Night Rakshasa had been searching separately, confirming that only low-level vengeful spirits were present.  Unexpectedly, an unknown entity was hiding in the ghostly fog, secretly watching them and seizing the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>This entity not only ambushed and attacked but also knew how to target his soul mark, showing high intelligence, unlike the vengeful spirits.</p><p>Why could such an anomaly be born in the Ghostlands?</p><p>Apart from him, no one else in the cultivation world could have passed through the Nine Netherworld Infernal Fires to enter this place. Even if there were remnants of ancient cultivators' souls, they would have long since lost their intelligence over the countless years, becoming mindless vengeful spirits. Could a vengeful spirit have undergone some kind of mutation?</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted, fixing on the direction where the Flying Night Rakshasa disappeared. He summoned the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner and pursued at full speed.</p><p>All signs pointed to an opponent of low strength but with incredibly cunning methods.</p><p>As his cultivation advanced, the Flying Night Rakshasa's usefulness would diminish, but it still possessed the strength of a nascent soul cultivator—a powerful combatant. Qin Sang would not let it be taken away so inexplicably.</p>
