<h1>Chapter 790: Flower Fairy Lake</h1><p>Qin Sang considered his options for a moment, then set off towards the teleportation formation.</p><p>He returned to the valley once more, but found nothing new.</p><p>Finally, he retraced his steps, descending level by level until he emerged from the Celestial Tower.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators from both clans were nowhere to be seen. Outside the plaza, signs of a fierce battle were evident, suggesting they had fought all the way from inside the tower.</p><p>It was unclear who had ultimately won.</p><p>The area outside the tower was quiet. Qin Sang cautiously surveyed his surroundings, then slipped into the forest.</p><p>Checking the time, he saw he still had some left, but not enough to explore the heavily restricted secret realms. He could, however, spend a little time searching the mountains, hoping to find some spirit fruit.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang was about to depart, when he glanced down at his insect cage and remembered an ideal location.</p><p>Within the Seven Kill Sect were three perilous areas: the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, the Gloomy Valley, and Flower Fairy Lake. Others feared these places, but he could navigate them freely.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm had proven its abilities time and again, reaching places where even protective treasures couldn't.</p><p>Of the three, the Gloomy Valley was only accessible when it naturally appeared within the Seven Kill Sect domain.</p><p>Flower Fairy Lake, like the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, could be entered and exited at will.</p><p>This area was a natural depression and might have been a large lake before becoming a toxic zone, hence the name "Fairy Lake." The "Flower" part came from a peculiar plant ubiquitous in Flower Fairy Lake. The lake's toxicity originated from this plant.</p><p>Flower Fairy Lake was also located in these mountains, making it convenient to visit on his way back.</p><p>The intense poison deterred most cultivators from venturing into these dangerous areas, meaning there might be more opportunities there than elsewhere.</p><p>Both Xiang Yi and the young cultivator had relied on poison-repelling treasures bestowed by the Merchant Alliance to dare enter the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.  Besides them, Qin Sang had encountered no one else there, highlighting the rarity and value of such treasures.</p><p>Flower Fairy Lake was likely no different.</p><p>Even if he could only find food for the Fat Silkworm similar to the purple crystals he had found before, the trip wouldn't be in vain.</p><p>He could also explore the area, hoping to sense the bone flute's location again.</p><p>Despite the gathering of so many cultivators at the Celestial Tower and his encounter with the Nascent Soul cultivators, the bone flute had remained silent.</p><p>“That person had better not have died in the Seven Kill Sect,” Qin Sang thought, gazing at the distant mountain peaks.</p><p>Countless secret realms and restrictions existed within the sect. If that person perished in some obscure corner, their treasure would be lost.</p><p>The distant sky was dim, tinged with a faint green. Qin Sang activated a talisman and flew towards it.</p><p>There were two dock-like structures serving as entrances to Flower Fairy Lake. Qin Sang headed directly for the nearest one, arriving without incident.</p><p>"Still haven't found that person. I'll search Flower Fairy Lake. If the Fat Silkworm finds nothing, I'll go to the wasteland early and wait. I might be able to intercept that person..."</p><p>This thought ran through Qin Sang's mind as he organized his treasures.</p><p>He had no shortage of spirit stones and demon cores. The young cultivator from the Western幽 Alliance, a prominent figure among Foundation Establishment cultivators with a powerful background, had left him a substantial fortune.</p><p>It would be ideal to buy the bone flute with spirit stones.</p><p>However, Qin Sang held little hope for this.</p><p>This situation was different from the last. The man on Kunlun Island was desperate and had no choice but to sell the flute for survival.</p><p>Since he had specifically asked for the bone flute, the owner wouldn't part with it easily. He would need a strategy.  He had already decided to offer the treasures he had obtained from others, including the Golden Shackle and Golden Radiance Armor, for trade.</p><p>“Without the spiritual plants from the Hanging Garden, the Three-Light Jade Liquid is merely a healing elixir, equivalent in value to Ten-Thousand-Year Spirit Milk.  If necessary, I could offer a drop for the trade…”</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang gradually approached Flower Fairy Lake.</p><p>Flower Fairy Lake was no smaller than the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone. While it supposedly lacked chasms and abysses, the dangers at its heart were no less formidable.</p><p>From a distance, Qin Sang saw a vast green lake.</p><p>A type of flourishing toxic algae grew everywhere in the lake. The algae emitted a green fluorescence, standing tall and straight, transforming Flower Fairy Lake into a massive, beautiful emerald.</p><p>From afar, Qin Sang could see fields of the algae, the wind creating shimmering waves of fluorescence.</p><p>Once mature, the algae would shoot out seed pods resembling flower buds, light as willow catkins, whirling and dancing in the air, yet somehow unable to leave the confines of the lake.</p><p>The buds slowly unfurled,</p><p>Countless beautiful petals danced above Flower Fairy Lake, creating a breathtaking spectacle under the fluorescent glow.</p><p>But beneath this beauty lurked a deadly poison.</p><p>The pollen released by this algae carried a toxin feared by all cultivators.</p><p>A wooden bridge extended into the lake from the shore, but it was obscured by the swirling petals, its outer entrance barely visible. The bridge was ancient, not recently built.</p><p>This bridge was one of the two entrances to Flower Fairy Lake.</p><p>Qin Sang descended, making sure no one was following him, and approached the ancient bridge.</p><p>Halfway there, sensing something amiss, he suddenly dodged behind a boulder, frowning at the bridgehead.</p><p>The bridge was surrounded by the toxic algae, seemingly deserted.</p><p>There was no one in sight.</p><p>But Qin Sang felt uneasy.</p><p>From his vantage point, he quickly made a discovery. Someone had set a spirit array at the bridge entrance!</p><p>The array's disguise wasn't sophisticated, but the pollen-filled air within the lake made it impossible to see through from inside. Any cultivator emerging from the lake would step directly into the trap.</p><p>“Who set a trap here?”</p><p>This area was rarely visited, and there were two entrances to Flower Fairy Lake. It was uncertain if anyone had even entered. Setting a trap here to kill and steal seemed like a gamble.</p><p>Qin Sang found this odd. Searching further, he noticed an unusual mist-shrouded area in the forest beside Flower Fairy Lake. His keen senses detected a hidden sword energy, poised to strike.</p><p>This sword energy was unique, strangely familiar.</p><p>“It’s her!”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. Hidden there was Lady Liu!</p><p>Of the eight people who entered the Seven Kill Sect together, Qin Sang had a favorable impression of the Liu couple. They hadn't participated in the plot against him, so he harbored no ill will.</p><p>The couple had mentioned they entered the sect to seek a medicinal herb for Lady Liu. He hadn't expected to find her here, laying an ambush.</p><p>Qin Sang was reluctant to interfere in others' affairs, but this scene made him pause, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>He noticed that only Lady Liu was present, not her husband.</p><p>The couple's actions had shown them to be deeply devoted. Unless something had happened, Mr. Liu wouldn't leave her alone.</p><p>The Seven Kill Sect was rife with danger; accidents could happen at any time.</p><p>“Who is Lady Liu ambushing? Could it be... Did something happen after they left the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone?”</p><p>This thought sparked a gleam in Qin Sang's eyes. He chose to remain hidden, donning his cloak and finding a concealed spot to observe.</p>
