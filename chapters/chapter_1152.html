<h1>Chapter 1144: The Lure of Thunder</h1><p>Chapter 1144: The Lure of Thunder</p><p>Boundless void.</p><p>The location is unknown.</p><p>Thunderclouds gather, stretching endlessly.</p><p>At the edge of vision, only a myriad-league glow of light can be seen, with thunder like a sea; nothing else is visible.</p><p>Qingluan's wings unfurl, ten thousand meters long, comparable to a mountain. Such a colossal creature is beyond belief, existing only in legends.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang has truly seen the divine beast, Qingluan.</p><p>Faced with the awe-inspiring power of heaven and earth and the great demon Qingluan—even if only a phantom—Qin Sang's mind buzzes, the world spinning.</p><p>Here, Qin Sang feels his own insignificance; a single thundercloud holds enough power to reduce him to ashes.</p><p>This is the Heavenly Thunder Marsh, a death trap for all living beings!</p><p>Even transformed demons and Yuan Ying masters would struggle here.</p><p>But Qingluan shows no fear, basking in the thunderclouds, moving freely. Countless bolts of lightning strike Qingluan repeatedly, yet fail to ruffle a feather.</p><p>A green light emanates from Qingluan's body.</p><p>The lightning, upon touching the green light, becomes docile, then dissipates, leaving only ripples.</p><p>“What realm is Qingluan? Could it be a legendary Celestial Demon?”</p><p>Qin Sang is terrified.</p><p>Qingluan treats the heavenly thunder as nothing, seemingly without even using its true energy; the lightning cannot harm it at all.  Its cries hold a certain contentment.</p><p>Such power is terrifying, unimaginable.</p><p>“No! It's absorbing the power of the thunderclouds!”</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang notices a clue. Qingluan isn't fighting the thunder; that's why the clouds can't harm it. The lightning bolts are actively drawn to it.</p><p>Whether confronting or absorbing the thunderclouds is beyond the comprehension of ordinary beings.</p><p>“It's a Thunder Qingluan!”</p><p>Qin Sang's mind races, guessing that the Qingluan roaming the thunderclouds in the phantom is likely the true form of the Qingluan shadow from the mysterious stone tablet.</p><p>Senior Sister Qing Jun only glimpsed it briefly, failing to see its full form. When carving the Qingluan puppet, she could only rely on her imagination, granting it the ability to control fire.</p><p>The scene in the void is monotonous.</p><p>Constantly enveloped by thunder, Qin Sang can't clearly see its expression. Qingluan seems to be hurrying, its gaze fixed ahead, racing towards a distant point, piercing through one thundercloud after another.</p><p>The myriad-league glow remains far ahead.</p><p>Endless thunderclouds, seemingly without end.</p><p>After his initial shock, Qin Sang recovers and attempts to leave the phantom.</p><p>“Such a terrifying Qingluan… no wonder a mere shadow could persist until now. The mysterious stone tablet only sealed a shadow? What exactly entered my body?”</p><p>He worries about his body.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as this thought arises, Qin Sang feels a tearing pain that instantly rips him from the phantom.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Qin Sang lets out a piercing scream.</p><p>This pain is unlike anything he has ever experienced; even the agony of using Star Yuan to break through his cultivation is far less intense.</p><p>His entire body is in pain.</p><p>Flesh, meridians, bone marrow, qi sea—a foreign force seems to tear through Qin Sang, searching inch by inch but failing to find something.</p><p>In this moment, Qin Sang feels he will be torn to shreds.</p><p>Even now, Qin Sang doesn't understand why this is happening.</p><p>But connecting the Qingluan shadow with his visualization of a Celestial Demon, his cultivation of the "Celestial Demon Transformation", and the Qingluan aura on his body, Qin Sang has a vague idea.</p><p>This force is extremely violent, imbued with the aura of thunder, identical to the Qingluan in his vision.</p><p>Qing Jun first touched the tablet, then it fell into the hands of the Qieji Demon King.</p><p>Qing Jun is human, while the Qieji Demon King is a transformed snake demon; neither has Qingluan bloodline.</p><p>In their hands, the mysterious stone tablet was normal; activating its true energy only manifested the Qingluan shadow.  It's only when Qin Sang touched the Qingluan shadow that this invasion happened.</p><p>This is definitely no coincidence!</p><p>Waves of pain wash over Qin Sang. He knows that if this continues, his end will be grim!</p><p>“Celestial Demon Transformation!”</p><p>A thought flashes in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Only the originator can solve the problem. Whether it works or not, he can only grasp this last lifeline.</p><p>Enduring the excruciating pain, Qin Sang forces himself to focus and activates this technique.</p><p>In that instant, the Qingluan force seems to find two outlets, madly surging towards the phoenix wings on Qin Sang's back.</p><p>This pair of phoenix wings, conjured by a celestial demon's power, weren't solid; merely incredibly dense, creating an illusion of substance.  The moment power surged in, the wings blazed, blurring the line between real and unreal.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Suddenly, cracks appeared on the wings.</p><p>Even these illusory wings couldn't withstand the power and were on the verge of destruction.</p><p>Qin Sang, barely catching his breath, inwardly cried out, frantically channeling his cultivation technique to reconstitute the wings.</p><p>He also made a new discovery.</p><p>His body, infused with star essence, had reached its limit, only a hair's breadth from breaking through to the fourth level. Now, as he cultivated, signs of a breakthrough were subtly emerging.</p><p>But time was of the essence.</p><p>The Qingluan power was too violent and overwhelming.</p><p>Before he could even grasp the celestial demon form described in his technique, he was already overwhelmed by the terrifying impact.</p><p>'Crack...crack...'</p><p>Crack after crack appeared.</p><p>The phoenix wings warped and twisted, nearing their breaking point.</p><p>To make matters worse, Qin Sang's injuries worsened.</p><p>"Am I going to die here?"</p><p>The thought crossed Qin Sang's mind, instantly dismissed as he focused on breaking through!</p><p>He would absolutely not give up his will to survive!</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly noticed a faint suction force in his dantian, absorbing the Qingluan power.</p><p>"Sky-Eyed Butterfly!"</p><p>Qin Sang joyfully discovered it was his companion insect, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, absorbing the Qingluan power!</p><p>The divine beast Qingluan, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Two completely unrelated creatures. Why could the butterfly absorb it?</p><p>"Thunder! That's it! Thunder Control! It's the Thunder Control!"</p><p>Qin Sang instantly understood.</p><p>This was the power of a thunderbird!</p><p>After its transformation, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly had also gained Thunder Control, though largely unused until now.  It had become a key catalyst.</p><p>It could withstand the thunderbird's power, sharing the burden and benefiting itself in the process!</p><p>"Will it evolve or transform after absorption?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>The suction intensified, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly absorbing more and more Qingluan power. Qin Sang's pain lessened slightly, the phoenix wings stabilized, giving him a much-needed reprieve.</p><p>He poured all his energy into the "Celestial Demon Transformation," seeking the breakthrough.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a falcon demon's furious roar: "Are you crazy?! Run! You're going to die! I haven't lived long enough!"</p><p>Startled, Qin Sang's focus snapped back to reality.</p><p>The entire treasury lay in ruins, the anomaly caused by the Qingluan phantom having already burst forth from the treasury!</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Finally, all caught up.</p><p>It's the last day of the month, fellow readers.
