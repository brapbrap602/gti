<h1>Chapter 2059: Si Lu</h1><p>As Qin Sang expected, the Haitang Academy did not relentlessly pursue him.</p><p>Shaking off his pursuers, Qin Sang first found a place to adjust his breath, then returned to the Turbid Wave Sea.  The journey was uneventful.</p><p>By now, Su Nu had already brought the Si You tribesman back to the agreed-upon location. She, too, had sensed the aura of the late Void Refinement realm cultivator before leaving. Despite knowing Qin Sang's considerable strength, she couldn't help but worry. Had Qin Sang's tone not been so confident, she would have considered sending the Si You tribesman away immediately.  Seeing Qin Sang safe and sound, she breathed a sigh of relief and hastened to open the cave dwelling's restrictions, welcoming him inside.</p><p>They had carved out this cave dwelling on a remote island, casually constructing a few pavilions.</p><p>"Where is the Si You tribesman?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Su Nu pointed towards a side hall. "He's injured. I gave him some medicinal pills; he's currently recuperating."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over. The restrictions here were personally set up by Su Nu, allowing him to perceive the situation within the side hall through them.  He discovered a lingering aura inside.  This person, while healing, hadn't set up any additional protective formations.</p><p>Unless this person was naive, this act was likely an expression of a certain attitude.</p><p>"Have you spoken with him?"</p><p>They had risked their lives to rescue this person for one purpose: to act as their guide to the Mist Sea.  Refusal wasn't an option.</p><p>If this person was sensible, it would save them some trouble.</p><p>"We haven't had a chance to talk in depth yet.  His injuries are quite severe, old wounds compounded by new ones. Moreover, he recently broke through to Void Refinement, what the foreign tribes call the Second Initial Stage of the Empty Realm. His cultivation isn't stable yet. Any further delay might destabilize his Dao Foundation, leaving behind hidden dangers.  Considering his future usefulness to us, I let him focus on healing first." Su Nu paused. "However, he seems to understand the situation."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked, "Did you ask him where the other Si You tribesman went?"</p><p>He hadn't sensed the other person's aura towards the end, making it easy to guess that things hadn't gone well.</p><p>Su Nu had already inquired. "Dead! To ensure his escape, the other person ignited their lifeblood, detonating a secret treasure, attempting to perish together with the enemy."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  He mused, "It seems this person's identity is not simple!"</p><p>This person had just broken through to Void Refinement, yet the enemy dispatched so many experts to capture him, even including a late Void Refinement cultivator. Such attention implied his companion must have been a powerful figure, at least mid Void Refinement, or even late!</p><p>For such a powerful cultivator to willingly die for this person suggested either a close familial relationship or an extremely high status.</p><p>They had previously learned that the Celestial and Aquatic Assemblies of the foreign tribes were merely alliances. The Merfolk, for instance, wouldn't interfere in the internal affairs of the Aquatic Assembly's various tribes.  Naturally, within the tribes, equality couldn't be assumed, leading to distinctions of rank and status.</p><p>Su Nu smiled, echoing, "Looks like we've caught a big fish.  It's a pity we aren't from the foreign tribes; otherwise, we might have been able to use him to achieve something significant."</p><p>"Not necessarily…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment. "Let him heal first. Before he emerges, you and I will take turns guarding him. How are the other arrangements coming along? Once he awakens, barring any unforeseen circumstances, we should be setting off."</p><p>Su Nu's smile faded. "Cultivators from Blue Sand Prefecture frequently venture out to sea, delving into the vast ocean, tempering themselves and seeking opportunities. Some have seen a business opportunity in this, forging treasure ships to ferry these cultivators. First, these ship captains are familiar with the surrounding waters. Second, with a large group, they're less fearful of external threats, allowing them to conserve their strength for the initial leg of the journey, facing later dangers at full strength. Regardless of what news this person brings upon waking, taking a treasure ship is our best option for the first part of our sea voyage."</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Su Nu, having spent many years in Blue Sand Prefecture, was far more familiar with the area than he was. He decided to follow her lead.</p><p>Su Nu nodded.  "I've contacted a few ship captains previously.  Qin Xiong, please keep watch here.  I'll go out and inquire about their departure schedules."</p><p>"Alright.  Those foreign tribes might still be searching for us.  Be careful," Qin Sang reminded her, watching as Su Nu left.  He then summoned Jian Nu and the brothers Qing Jia and Qing Yi.</p><p>"What are your instructions, True Man?" Jian Nu asked, bowing his head.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the two brothers.</p><p>Their Golden Core realm cultivation was too low for a transoceanic voyage. They needed to reach at least Nascent Soul. Qin Sang had made preparations early on, bestowing them with numerous medicinal pills. The two brothers were diligent and had made great strides in their cultivation, reaching the Fourth Order of the Origin Realm, the threshold of Nascent Soul.</p><p>"During this time, please guide them, striving for a breakthrough as soon as possible." Qin Sang entrusted the two brothers to Jian Nu.  Despite not being of the same lineage, the Great Dao was interconnected, making Jian Nu more than capable of guiding them.</p><p>Jian Nu readily agreed and immediately led the two away.</p><p>Qin Sang contemplated for a moment, then flipped his hand, revealing a jade gourd obtained from the Quan Feng tribesman. It was a Mustard Seed type magical artifact.</p><p>The tribesman, nearly slain by the sword formation, had discarded this item.</p><p>After some attempts, Qin Sang successfully broke the restrictions.  A sweep of his divine sense revealed that this was certainly not the tribesman's primary storage artifact.  Qin Sang had anticipated this. Such artifacts, crucial to one's life and fortune, were specially refined. Unless the owner perished, they couldn't be easily seized.</p><p>Despite the lack of precious treasures, the jade gourd's internal space was filled to the brim with rows of unrefined spiritual herbs and materials, all rare within the human realm.</p><p>Qin Sang instantly understood their origin. The foreign tribes came to Blue Sand Prefecture mainly to trade with humans. These were likely items brought from the Mist Sea, yet to be sold, now falling into his hands, an unexpected windfall.</p><p>He gladly accepted them and sat down in meditation.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.  Su Nu hadn't returned yet. Qin Sang suddenly felt a fluctuation in the restrictions, awakening from his meditative state.  He sensed the side hall's restrictions being opened; the Si You tribesman had awakened.</p><p>Qin Sang rose and pushed the door open.</p><p>The Si You tribe's young master, Si Lu, was pale, clearly still injured, but his internal aura had stabilized.</p><p>He was observing the surroundings of the cave dwelling. Sensing something, he looked towards the main hall. Seeing Qin Sang, his expression turned serious.</p><p>He knew that Qin Sang had single-handedly held back their pursuers, fighting several powerful enemies and returning unscathed.  His strength was evident.  Not daring to be disrespectful, he bowed deeply.</p><p>"Si Lu greets Fellow Daoist Qin! I was previously troubled by my injuries and only now can I thank you in person. Please forgive my tardiness."</p><p>They had both learned each other's names through Su Nu, eliminating the need for introductions.  Qin Sang looked Si Lu up and down, dismissing his apology. "Fellow Daoist, your old injuries have lingered, affecting your Dao Foundation. It's somewhat troublesome. But you needn't worry. This place is sufficiently safe; no one will disturb your recuperation."</p><p>"Thank you to both Fellow Daoists. Not only did you save my life, but you also provided me with a sanctuary.  Si Lu is eternally grateful."</p><p>Si Lu's expression was earnest.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, gesturing towards the main hall. "Fellow Daoist, if you have the time, perhaps we could chat inside."</p><p>Si Lu agreed and entered the main hall.  They took their seats according to guest and host etiquette.  Gu Ya, having received instructions earlier, served spiritual tea and stood by.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured. "Please!"</p><p>Si Lu glanced at Gu Ya, took a sip of tea. His mind was heavy, unable to fully appreciate the taste, but he still complimented it as good tea.</p><p>Qin Sang put down his jade cup and, without beating around the bush, went straight to the point. "I observe Fellow Daoist's noble aura and cultivation. Within the Si You tribe, you must hold a distinguished status.  But why have you ended up here, with these pursuers relentlessly chasing you all the way to Blue Sand Prefecture?"</p><p>Si Lu composed himself and sighed.  "Those Quan Feng tribesmen, we had no prior grievances with them. We encountered them by chance not long ago. They inadvertently recognized our identities and wanted to capture us, returning to the Aquatic Assembly to claim credit. At that time, we were already injured, unable to withstand their assault, and could only continue fleeing.  However, we didn't expect them to have such a significant presence here.  They've found us several times."</p><p>Qin Sang understood, nodding. "I see."</p><p>"As for before…"</p><p>Si Lu hesitated. "We provoked a powerful enemy within our tribe, which led to our exile here."</p><p>Seeing his evasiveness, Qin Sang wouldn't let him get away with it.  "What kind of powerful enemy?"</p><p>Seeing that he couldn't hide it, Si Lu forced a smile. "I wonder how much the two Fellow Daoists know about our foreign tribes. Within the foreign tribes, each tribe's situation varies.  The Si You tribe is ruled by a royal family, who appoint lords to govern the land. I was originally a regional lord, cultivating in my own territory.  Unexpectedly, a rival suddenly rose to power, launching an attack.  My allies, fearing this person, dared not come to my aid.  There were also traitors within my ranks.  At the time, I hadn't yet broken through to the Second Stage of the Empty Realm. Isolated and outnumbered, facing enemies both within and without, I not only lost my territory but also ended up in this predicament."</p><p>Revealing his weaknesses, Si Lu couldn't help but feel ashamed.</p><p>Qin Sang observed his expression, seemingly genuine, but this might not be the entire truth.  He asked curiously, "Fellow Daoist, before reaching the Second Stage of the Empty Realm, you were able to rule as a lord?  Moreover, the other party openly attacked a fellow tribesman, seizing your territory and relentlessly pursuing you.  Could the royal family tolerate this?"</p><p>He wondered how significant bloodline was within the Si You tribe. Top-tier clans possessed countless experts. Even for a descendant of royalty, without formidable strength, how could one command respect?</p><p>"My father left behind several veteran ministers, utterly loyal to him.  With their protection, I was able to maintain my position. As for the royal family, not only would they not interfere, they would actually welcome conflict among the lords.  In reality, even if they wanted to interfere, they might not have the ability. The royal family's strength isn't much greater than some of the lords.  The highest cultivation wouldn't exceed the Second Stage of the Empty Realm.  Tribe elders who have reached the Saint Realm have all entered the Sacred Ground for cultivation, detached from worldly affairs…"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's eyes flickered. "Sacred Ground?"</p><p>The foreign tribes' Saint Realm was equivalent to the human race's Body Integration stage. The Si You tribe truly did possess Saint Realm experts!</p><p>"Indeed," Si Lu nodded. "It's said that within the Sacred Ground are resources necessary for cultivators beyond the Saint Realm. Cultivating there yields significantly greater results."</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang suddenly realized something, slightly bowing, and asked further, "What Sacred Ground?  Is it your tribe's Sacred Ground, or the entire foreign tribes' Sacred Ground?"</p><p>Possessing resources required by Body Integration cultivators, any tribe controlling such a Sacred Ground would undoubtedly keep it a closely guarded secret. Yet Si Lu revealed this information so readily.  Was the Si You tribe not afraid of attracting the covetous gazes of other tribes?</p><p>Unless…</p><p>"Naturally, it is the Sacred Ground of our entire foreign tribes! Whether from the Celestial or Aquatic Assembly, it is said that once someone reaches the Saint Realm, most, like our tribe elders, enter the Sacred Ground for cultivation.  Unless matters concerning the survival of the tribe arise, the elders rarely appear.  It's presumably the same for other tribes."</p><p>Si Lu initially intended to invoke the authority of the tribe elders, but thought better of it. At least within the Si You tribe, once elders entered the Sacred Ground, they seemed to sever their worldly ties. There was no precedent of them emerging due to threats against their descendants.</p><p>Had Qin Sang not intervened, he would have already become a captive. If he had a Saint Realm expert backing him, why hadn't they appeared yet?</p><p>Such a claim was easily refutable and might even backfire.</p><p>His current priority was to gain the trust of these individuals as much as possible, protect himself, and accumulate strength.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were deep as he pondered.  He never expected such a situation within the foreign tribes.</p><p>Saint Realm experts secluded within the Sacred Ground, detached from worldly affairs.  This meant that the strongest among the foreign tribes in the mortal world were only at the late Void Refinement realm.</p><p>Having briefly clashed with Elder Quan, he had a general understanding of a late Void Refinement cultivator's strength.  Once he reached mid Void Refinement, with his various divine abilities and treasures, he wouldn't necessarily fear them!</p><p>Previously believing the foreign tribes possessed countless experts, he had been worried about inadvertently attracting Body Integration cultivators, treading carefully with every step.  Now, knowing he wouldn't face such powerhouses, the pressure lessened considerably.</p><p>However, Si Lu hadn't completely ruled out the possibility.  There might still be Body Integration experts in the mortal world. The foreign tribes held vast power, with numerous internal tribes and external threats from other races.  Someone had to maintain order.</p><p>Moreover, if he attracted several late Void Refinement cultivators, he would still have to flee in disarray.  Caution was still necessary in his future actions.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, Si Lu couldn't help but speak, "The two Fellow Daoists rescued me. I don't know what you require of me, but please be forthright, so I can be prepared and avoid this constant unease."</p><p>He was ready to be tasked with something.</p><p>Xia Changshi's dying words still echoed in his ears: Preserve yourself above all else. Only with your life intact can you have a chance to rise again!</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Si Lu and, channeling a wisp of spiritual energy, manifested an image in the air—the image of the Chang You tribesman from Gu Ya's memory.</p><p>"This tribe is called Chang You, also a foreign tribe from the Mist Sea.  Do you recognize them, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Si Lu stared at the image, pondering for a long while, then slightly shook his head, ashamedly saying, "I was previously eager to break through to the Second Stage of the Empty Realm, dedicating myself to cultivation.  The tribe provided everything I needed, and I rarely paid attention to external matters. Regarding the internal affairs of the Celestial Assembly, I only know of a few renowned upper tribes.  I truly don't recognize this tribe. However…"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, seeing he had more to say, and didn't interrupt.</p><p>Si Lu mused, "Observing this tribe's appearance and the divine abilities Fellow Daoist described, I'm reminded of the Zhu Yan tribe.  It's said this tribe and some of their vassal tribes all resemble apes in appearance. The Chang You tribe might be a vassal tribe affiliated with the Zhu Yan tribe."</p><p>Through Si Lu's explanation, Qin Sang learned that the Celestial Assembly revered the Feathered People as their rulers, but there were also many powerful tribes.  In important matters, the Feathered People had to consult with them.</p><p>These major tribes would then attract smaller tribes to affiliate with them, becoming known as upper tribes, while the smaller tribes were called vassal tribes.</p><p>Upper and vassal tribes were relative terms.  Affiliation wasn't complete subservience.</p>
