<h1>Chapter 2270: Another Plot Against Zhenlei</h1><p>A soul contract, a pact binding souls, cannot be broken unless the initiator releases it. Even with godlike abilities, it's unbreakable.  Just like the Immortal Emperor, Little Yellow Chick—formerly just a God King—even he, as an Emperor, couldn't break the contract.  To prevent this fellow from changing his mind and causing a backlash, the Masters Continent established a rule: even if someone transcends the Heavenly Dao register, they can’t escape a soul contract!</p><p>“A soul contract can’t be severed from the consciousness sea.  But I've integrated a special energy that can dissolve even the Heavenly Dao.  Breaking this contract isn't difficult… with enough power to bombard the contract's location, it's achievable!”</p><p>the Ruthless One declared.</p><p>Soul contracts are founded on the Heavenly Dao.  A special energy can dissolve even the Heavenly Dao of the God Realm, so dissolving a soul contract, if handled correctly, is child's play.</p><p>“I see…” Zhang Xuan's eyes flickered.</p><p>“Considering all I've told you, it's my thanks for bringing me to the God Realm!”</p><p>Having explained, the Ruthless One said no more.  Their aura grew ancient and profound; the black hole behind them expanded, visibly absorbing immense power as they spoke.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan, the more the black hole consumes, the stronger he becomes…”</p><p>Luo Ruoxi, noticing the anomaly, urgently transmitted her concerns.</p><p>“Prepare to attack!” Zhang Xuan, his doubts dispelled, took a deep breath, raising his sword: “Then let's settle this!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The most powerful sword intent unleashed once more.</p><p>To live is to return, to die is to yearn for reunion!</p><p>Life and death hold no fear, what can stop me?</p><p>This sword technique, though not at the Emperor level, contained all his resolve, pushing his Heavenly Compassion technique to the limit.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>One sword cleaved the Ruthless One’s attack in two.</p><p>Simultaneously, Luo Ruoxi struck, her jade hands weaving, sword energy like falling snow.  Her swordsmanship resembled that of the young man from Sword God Heaven—unyielding momentum and natural grace.</p><p>“Your skills are impressive, but compared to me… they fall short…”</p><p>With a light smile, the Ruthless One attacked again.</p><p>In an instant, the sky was obscured, their hand engulfing the heavens and earth, shattering space, as if the sun, moon, and stars would be crushed.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Zhang Xuan and Luo Ruoxi were sent flying, blood spraying.</p><p>Even with their strength, they couldn't withstand it!</p><p>What realm has this person reached?</p><p>“Audacious!”  The clone strode forward, each step blooming a lotus, the sound of flowing water echoing through the void.  From afar, it was quite impressive.</p><p>Having refined the Nine Heavens Chaotic Golden Lotus, his cultivation was on par with Zhang Xuan’s.</p><p>He unleashed a punch, its power reaching the heavens.</p><p>Clashing with the Ruthless One, he too was sent flying, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p>Zhang Xuan clutched his forehead.</p><p>Even as an Emperor, his clone still hasn’t shed its pretentious nature…</p><p>This flashy display of power would be far more effective if concentrated!</p><p>“Attack together! Otherwise, if they die, we all die…”</p><p>Little Yellow Chick roared, crimson flames engulfing him, igniting the sky.</p><p>The remaining six Emperors also unleashed their powers.</p><p>Seven Emperors combined, their might capable of destroying the world, overwhelming any defense, but their opponent was the Ruthless One, empowered by a special energy.  As the attack neared, the black hole expanded, instantly devouring the force and countering with a devastating attack.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The seven Emperors, like Zhang Xuan and the others, were sent flying.</p><p>Ten Emperors united, yet they couldn't withstand a single attack!</p><p>How could this person be so strong?</p><p>“You may die now…”</p><p>Having shattered their defenses, the Ruthless One took a step forward, hand raised to strike again.</p><p>“You insolent cur!”</p><p>A roar echoed as the elderly man from Sword God Heaven suddenly appeared, blocking the attack, his sword transforming into a silver river.</p><p>“An Emperor? He's also an Emperor?”</p><p>Zhang Xuan's pupils constricted.</p><p>This elder, previously following the young man, was thought to be merely a follower, at most a titled God King.  Only upon seeing his power did they realize he was also an Emperor!</p><p>If he's an Emperor, what was the young man?</p><p>“He is an Emperor of Sword God Heaven…” Luo Ruoxi struggled to her feet, gritting her teeth.</p><p>“Then… the young man who taught me swordsmanship?” Zhang Xuan could contain his curiosity no longer.</p><p>“He is…” Luo Ruoxi was about to answer when space twisted.  They saw the Sword God Heaven Emperor sent flying, crashing into a massive crater.</p><p>Even Zhang Xuan, surpassing him in strength and swordsmanship, couldn't contend with him; despite his strong cultivation and skill, he was still no match for him.</p><p>"Haha, Emperor, a bunch of rabble! Today, I will destroy the Nine Heavens, destroy this divine realm, and flatten all rules!"</p><p>The Emperor of Sword Heaven was defeated, and the ruthless one laughed wildly. The surrounding space continuously collapsed, making him look demonic.</p><p>"What do we do?" Zhang Xuan clenched his fists.</p><p>He and his clone had unleashed their strongest attacks, and even Luo Ruoxi had used her strongest move, yet they couldn't withstand a single blow...</p><p>Could it be that no one in the divine realm could stop this person?</p><p>Could they just let him destroy the world?</p><p>"The only way… is to return your incomplete Heaven's Mandate to its original state, letting the Mandate suppress him…" Luo Ruoxi clenched her delicate fists, her eyes reddening.</p><p>"Return it to its original state?" Zhang Xuan understood her meaning.</p><p>The library in his mind was part of the Heaven's Mandate. Once it returned, the Mandate would be complete, perhaps repairing the flaw and expelling the ruthless one.</p><p>Like a human body's immune system.</p><p>A complete immune system easily repels viruses; a damaged one cannot resist viral invasion, and even the strongest person will die.</p><p>But…</p><p>"He's too powerful. Even if the Heaven's Mandate is restored, it might not be able to suppress him!" Zhang Xuan shook his head.</p><p>The immune system can kill viruses, but… what about a tiger?</p><p>Even the strongest immune system wouldn't stand a chance.</p><p>This person, while merely an ordinary God King, even with a title, could be easily killed by the Heaven's Mandate, yet he's stronger than the Emperor… beyond the Mandate's ability to contend with.</p><p>"This…" Luo Ruoxi paused, a look of disappointment on her beautiful face. "Yes… we can't suppress him, but if the Heaven's Mandate is complete, he can wake up, and killing this person won't be difficult!"</p><p>"He?" Zhang Xuan frowned.</p><p>"I'll take you to him, he's in Zizai Heaven…" Taking a deep breath, Luo Ruoxi gritted her teeth and flew forward.</p><p>"Trying to escape?" The ruthless one sneered, pressing down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Luo Ruoxi fell from the sky.</p><p>"You…" Zhang Xuan unleashed his swordsmanship again, his sword intent brilliant.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>He was blocked again by the ruthless one.</p><p>"Go! I'll hold him off…"</p><p>Knowing they needed to find another way to save the divine realm instead of fleeing, the clone and the Immortal Emperor shouted, standing in front, while Luo Qiqi transformed back into her Jingkong Orb form.</p><p>The surrounding space solidified.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Seeing everyone selflessly blocking behind them, unafraid of death, Zhang Xuan's eyes reddened. However, knowing this wasn't the time to talk, he pulled Luo Ruoxi, his body flickered, breaking through space, and the next moment they were in Zizai Heaven.</p><p>Zizai Heaven was no longer peaceful. The divine realm was collapsing, and chaos reigned everywhere.</p><p>"Where's the person you mentioned?"</p><p>Without time to observe the lives of ordinary people, Zhang Xuan looked at the girl in his arms.</p><p>If the person she mentioned could really save the divine realm, what did his own sacrifice matter!</p><p>"He's my father. The blood in your pendant is his. The Immortal Emperor was once his pet…" Luo Ruoxi took a breath to recover, explaining.</p><p>"Father?"</p><p>Zhang Xuan suddenly understood.</p><p>No wonder he always felt the blood in the pendant was similar to Luo Ruoxi's yet different; it was her father's.</p><p>This also explained why the remnant thought of the Immortal Emperor immediately recognized him as its master upon seeing the pendant.</p><p>"Is your father also an Emperor? Or possesses strength exceeding that of an Emperor?"</p><p>He couldn't help but ask.</p><p>The chaos in the library was the blood in the pendant that allowed him to regain consciousness. Could it be that not only she was an Emperor, but her father was too, and even stronger?</p><p>If so, why was he in a coma?</p><p>And why did it require an incomplete Heaven's Mandate to awaken him?</p><p>"He's not an Emperor, but… the Heaven's Mandate!"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi clenched her fists.</p><p>"The Heaven's Mandate? Your father… is the Heaven's Mandate?" Zhang Xuan was shocked, disbelieving.</p><p>"Yes! Fifty years ago, Father couldn't withstand that giant hand and fell into a coma. The Heaven's Mandate scattered into three parts: Ordered Heaven's Mandate and Incomplete Heaven's Mandate, entering spatial turbulence. I took over the Natural Heaven's Mandate, maintaining the balance of the divine realm. To restore him, I have to gather the scattered parts… that's why I'm so determined, I can't fail! That's why I specifically entered the Master's Continent, researched the Spring and Autumn Annals, and tried to defeat Master Kong!  When I fought Master Kong, the favor I asked for was also related to this."</p><p>Luo Ruoxi said.</p><p>Zhang Xuan understood.</p><p>He had met her not long ago on Master's Continent, and she had told him her story, wanting to save a loved one. He didn't understand at the time, but now he realized.</p><p>It was her father, and he was the Heaven's Mandate of the divine realm!</p><p>Could the Heaven's Mandate actually take human form and have children?</p><p>"Took over the Natural Heaven's Mandate… you don't have any Heaven's Mandate fragments in your body?" Suddenly realizing the inconsistency in her words, Zhang Xuan looked at her.</p><p>Controlling it from outside and merging with it are two entirely different concepts.</p><p>“I only control it; I’m not a part of the Heavenly Dao…” Luo Ruoxi said.</p><p>Zhang Xuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>This meant he only needed to separate the flaw in the Heavenly Dao, he didn't need her to die.</p><p>Although he didn't want to accept this fate, he wasn't willing to let the girl in front of him get hurt either.</p><p>“If I separate the flaw in the Heavenly Dao within me, your father can be revived, and even the Ruthless One can be defeated, right?” Zhang Xuan asked.</p><p>“That… I’m not sure…”</p><p>Looking up at the shattered Celestial Realm, Luo Ruoxi hesitated.</p><p>The Celestial Realm was her father's foundation. Now that the foundation was gone, even if he woke up, could he really defeat that powerful Ruthless One?</p><p>It was hard to say!</p><p>“It seems you can’t be certain either. In that case, we should rely on ourselves… We have to find our own way!” Zhang Xuan gritted his teeth. “You, me, my clone, along with the Nine Heavens Nine Emperors, and if we cooperate with Master Kong, we might be able to win!”</p><p>“Master Kong? He…” Luo Ruoxi frowned.</p><p>“Master Kong is dead, right? He isn’t truly dead. If I’m not mistaken, his death was merely a method to separate himself from the Heavenly Dao… If I'm right, he should be a [Primordial Fetal Soul Body], just like Wei Changfeng!”</p><p>Zhang Xuan said.</p><p>Seeing Wei Changfeng made him understand that Master Kong’s ability to retain his consciousness was likely due to him also being a Primordial Fetal Soul Body.</p><p>They could remain conscious even before birth.</p><p>Coupled with the preparations he made beforehand, his resurrection was only a matter of time.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was stunned; she hadn’t expected this.</p><p>“Let’s go see. If I’m right, he should have recovered already. Otherwise, his students wouldn't have stayed away from the Tidal Sea…” Zhang Xuan said.</p><p>Master Kong’s students, like Zi Yuan Gu Sheng and others, were all incredibly powerful. Even without the Emperor's help, they would certainly have a way to enter the Tidal Sea, yet none of them were there.</p><p>There must be something more important they were waiting for, something to be done while all the Emperors were preoccupied at the Tidal Sea!</p><p>And this important matter was clearly Master Kong’s recovery.</p><p>“This…” Luo Ruoxi was shocked, suddenly understanding.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without further explanation, with a wave of his hand, Zhang Xuan returned to Master Kong’s residence, and indeed saw an old man levitating cross-legged in the air. Seeing them arrive, he smiled slightly: “You’ve come!”</p><p>If it wasn't Master Kong, who else could it be!</p><p>This master of all ages truly hadn't let him down!</p><p>Just as he had guessed, he had resurrected while everyone’s attention was focused on the Tidal Sea.</p><p>“You…” Luo Ruoxi trembled.</p><p>She knew Emperors could be resurrected, and the Immortal Emperors had also revived, but… she didn't expect it to be this fast!</p><p>“I concealed it from the Heavenly Dao and made preparations beforehand. The nameless giant in the Ghost Pool was something I left behind.  When you killed him, I used the opportunity to break free from the Heavenly Dao's constraints and reconstitute my physical body. I've only just recovered.”</p><p>Master Kong smiled faintly.</p><p>He was proficient in manipulating time. It seemed like only one or two days had passed in the Celestial Realm, but in reality, he had spent an unknown amount of time recovering his strength.</p><p>It could have been decades.</p><p>“The three of us are strong, but defeating the Ruthless One won’t be easy…”</p><p>Seeing that Master Kong had indeed recovered, Luo Ruoxi still shook her head.</p><p>This wasn't about diminishing their own strength or exaggerating the opponent's; it was simply the truth.</p><p>Even with so many people working together before, they still couldn't stop the opponent.  Even with the addition of Master Kong, what difference would it make?</p><p>It wouldn't change the situation!</p><p>“Individually, or even combined, our strength is no match for the opponent. But… what if we fused everyone's power into one person?”</p><p>Master Kong looked at them, smiling.</p><p>“Fuse it into one person?”</p><p>This time, not only Luo Ruoxi frowned, but Zhang Xuan was also full of doubts.</p><p>“That hand could tear apart the Celestial Realm and shatter the Heavenly Dao itself. The strength is undeniable. The Ruthless One absorbed all that power, and consumed fifty years’ worth of the Celestial Realm’s spiritual energy.  In terms of pure strength, even individually, we are no match for him, even among the dozen or so Emperors…”</p><p>Master Kong said: “But if we unite, and concentrate our power on one person… it might be different!”</p><p>“How do we concentrate it?”</p><p>Luo Ruoxi looked at him.</p><p>It sounds simple, but it’s difficult to do.</p><p>The Emperors are already at the pinnacle of the Celestial Realm. If absorbing others' power was so easy, she wouldn't have stagnated for so many years.</p><p>“It’s simple… We concentrate our power onto Zhang Xuan.  Once he breaks through the Emperor’s shackles, he can save the Celestial Realm!”</p><p>Master Kong stated.</p><p>“Me?” Zhang Xuan was stunned. “Why me?”</p><p>“The Lingxi Emperor cultivated freedom and transcendence! But with the constraints of his father and Heaven’s Will, and with loved ones, he can never truly transcend! If I’m not mistaken, when you fought me before, you also gave up and intended to be killed by me!”</p><p>Kong Shi said.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was speechless.</p><p>During the battle, she had indeed considered this, so their initial exchange was more like a sparring match than a fight to the death.</p><p>“Inability to transcend naturally means one cannot unleash their full strength; even with more true energy, one cannot break through to the highest realm! As for me…”</p><p>Kong Shi nodded. “I cherish all beings, wanting to save the world, but I don't want others to sacrifice for me. Too much kindness is also a flaw! If I had been ruthless and exterminated the Yiling, the situation wouldn’t be like this…”</p><p>If the Yiling had been completely annihilated, the Ruthless One wouldn’t have been resurrected, and this wouldn’t be happening.</p><p>“Therefore, I’m not suitable either! But Zhang Xuan, your cultivation method is harmonious, without flaws. You value living your own life; even if you die, as long as you live without regret, your heart will be at peace. Such a person possesses greater tolerance and potential for growth. Only in this way can you go further and higher!”</p><p>Kong Shi continued.</p><p>To live is to return, to die is to be long remembered!</p><p>One who doesn't even fear death wouldn't be shackled by other things.</p><p>“This…” Zhang Xuan frowned, about to speak, when he saw Kong Shi looking at him intently. “Don’t refuse. Even if we had time to cultivate others, I don't think anyone could do it better. Although the Lingxi Emperor doesn't possess a fragment of Heaven’s Will, he has long controlled Heaven’s Will and has his own understanding of it; I control Heaven’s Will in an orderly manner. If we infuse our power into you, you will possess the complete power of Heaven’s Will! Combined with your clone’s Nine Heavens Chaos Golden Lotus, you can completely stabilize the nine heavens, control the universe, battle the nine skies, and annihilate all things!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Seeing that the decision had been made, further explanations were useless, so Zhang Xuan nodded.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He sat cross-legged, and in the blink of an eye, two powerful forces surged in from both sides.</p><p>Zhang Xuan’s body stiffened; he seemed to instantly transform into Heaven’s Will, soaring above the nine heavens.</p><p>His soul, body, and true energy were instantly cleansed, becoming stronger and more powerful.</p><p>…</p><p>“You want to stop me? Fine, I’ll kill you, then kill Zhang Xuan…”</p><p>After sending Luo Qiqi and his clone flying, the Ruthless One sneered.</p><p>The combined power of his clone and many Emperors was indeed formidable, but still weaker than him.</p><p>The Tide Sea had absorbed almost all the spiritual energy outside the city of the God Realm; now, this power served as his nourishment, giving him the ability to destroy the world with a flick of his wrist. Those Emperors and God Kings, though representing the peak of the God Realm, were no match for him.</p><p>The Ruthless One now seemed to represent the entire God Realm, unstoppable.</p><p>“The God Realm is destroyed; there’s no point in us living. I, Yun Chi, will perish with you…”</p><p>Yun Chi the Great transformed into his true form, a gigantic five-clawed golden dragon, charging towards him.</p><p>“You?  Not worthy!”</p><p>The Ruthless One squeezed his hand, and the golden dragon was trapped in his palm, unable to escape.</p><p>“Old friend, wait for me!”</p><p>Fu Meng the Great roared, transforming into his white tiger form, soaring into the air.</p><p>The Immortal Emperor, his immortal fire phoenix form ablaze, illuminated the sky.</p><p>Xuan Ming the Great, whose true form was a giant tortoise, seemed to support the heavens.</p><p>The four divine beasts, guarding the four cardinal directions of the God Realm, simultaneously transformed, slowing the collapse of the God Realm.</p><p>Time seemed to freeze.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>With four consecutive strikes, the Ruthless One suppressed the four beasts. A strong killing intent flashed in his eyes: “Since you seek death, I’ll grant it to you…”</p><p>As he was about to kill them all, he felt his raised arm tighten and stop in mid-air.</p><p>“Want to kill them? Ask me first…”</p><p>Then, to the astonishment of everyone, a figure slowly descended from the sky.</p><p>It was Zhang Xuan!</p><p>The young man now possessed surging power, ten times stronger than before. He descended from the heavens, like a world unto himself.</p><p>“Improved quite a bit…”</p><p>The Ruthless One stopped, his gaze serious.</p><p>He clearly didn't understand how the other’s strength had increased so dramatically in just a few minutes.</p><p>“But what does it matter? Even the God Realm at its peak couldn’t withstand me. I don’t believe you can stop me…”</p><p>With a cold snort, the Ruthless One attacked again.</p><p>Zhang Xuan raised his sword and met the attack.</p><p>As they fought, space tore apart, and air currents raged.</p><p>Could Zhang Xuan win?</p><p>Luo Ruoxi, at Kong Shi's base, watched with worry.</p><p>She and Kong Shi had transferred their power to Zhang Xuan, reducing their own cultivation to the God King level—a far cry from their former glory.  However, their level remained, and with sufficient power, they could eventually recover.</p><p>"With his current strength, victory is… difficult! Unless… he can achieve power beyond that of an Emperor!" Kong Shi said after a moment of silence.</p><p>Even a dozen Emperors combined couldn't defeat the Ruthless One.  Even transferring all their power to one person wouldn't guarantee victory. They did this because… only by concentrating power in one individual was there a chance of reaching the apex, truly surpassing limits, and breaking through!</p><p>"Power beyond an Emperor?" Luo Ruoxi's gaze grew distant.</p><p>Her father, while still alive, had spoken of the same thing. But… she couldn't do it. Could the man she loved?</p><p>"He can… He has an unyielding spirit! And a proud defiance of this world." Kong Shi smiled, sensing her doubts.</p><p>…</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After several consecutive blows, Zhang Xuan's knuckles cracked, a massive, horrific wound appearing on his chest.  As Kong Shi said, even with their combined power, forming a complete Heavenly Dao within him, he was still no match.</p><p>"Haha, I thought you were powerful, but you're nothing!" The Ruthless One sneered.</p><p>"I'm no match for you anyway, I'll be killed sooner or later.  Since that's the case, I want to die from your strongest attack…" Zhang Xuan took a deep breath, stopping his attack and looking at the Ruthless One.</p><p>"Fine, I'll grant you that, my strongest attack…"</p><p>Hearing this, the Ruthless One paused, then coldly snorted, raising a hand.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of green light appeared in their palm, striking down forcefully.</p><p>It was indeed their strongest attack.  The entire divine realm trembled, as if it couldn't bear it, another enormous crater appearing.</p><p>Zhang Xuan, eyes closed, didn't dodge.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His head exploded, his soul scattering.</p><p>"Zhang Xuan…" Everyone's face went pale at this sight.</p><p>Luo Qiqi seemed to go mad.</p><p>Yun Chi the Great and others widened their eyes, trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi were also stunned.</p><p>Their intention was for him to break through his limitations and strive for power beyond the Emperor realm.  Why didn't he resist, willingly accepting death?  Wasn't this a waste of their efforts?</p><p>"No, it's the Immortal Emperor's immortal technique…"</p><p>Just as they were puzzled, Kong Shi suddenly spoke.</p><p>Everyone then saw that Zhang Xuan, whose head had exploded and soul shattered,  had his chest pendant suddenly burst. A drop of blood floated up, ignited, forming a blazing flame. From within the flame, a completely unharmed figure slowly emerged.</p><p>"He… used the opponent's power, and the blood in the pendant, to separate the flawed Heavenly Dao and his soul?" Luo Ruoxi's pupils contracted.</p><p>Zhang Xuan, reborn from the flames, no longer had the Heavenly Dao Library within him, free from the Heavenly Dao's interference!</p><p>"How did he do it?" Kong Shi was equally incredulous.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao and soul were fused, inseparable. To break free, he had to shatter his soul, using the Netherworld Pool to reconstitute it.  This one… was simply killed once, and completely freed himself. What method did he use?</p><p>"I know… he used the Ruthless One's method of breaking free from the soul contract…" Luo Ruoxi realized.</p><p>Soul contracts bind master and servant; unless the master releases it, the servant is forever bound… The Heavenly Dao Library was the same, a stronger version of the contract.  Bound to the soul, it couldn't be escaped without death.</p><p>But… the Ruthless One had used a special power to break free from their soul contract. Zhang Xuan had inquired about the specific method before, likely planning this then.</p><p>That's why he deliberately fought to the death, allowing the Ruthless One to unleash their strongest attack.</p><p>Using this power, he was reborn from the flames, and it was a complete success!</p><p>"So that's it, that's the method to surpass an Emperor…"</p><p>Zhang Xuan, emerging from the flames, showed a faint smile, as if he'd understood something.  He gestured, and his clone instantly transformed into a lotus flower and flew towards him.</p><p>In an instant, it merged perfectly with him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, everyone felt that Zhang Xuan had become the Nine Heavens, the Nine Heavens were him.</p><p>He lightly stepped on the ground.</p><p>The chaotic Nine Heavens immediately stabilized.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Primordial Golden Lotus, born at the dawn of the Nine Heavens, stabilized the realm.  Zhang Xuan's avatar and true self achieved perfect fusion, becoming one. He now commanded this power.</p><p>More than that, his already peak cultivation, enhanced by the Lotus, showed signs of breaking through.</p><p>"Master-servant bond, brotherhood, teacher-student bond, familial love, romance... combined, they are all things in the world. This is what it means to be human!"</p><p>A smile played on Zhang Xuan's lips as he murmured to himself.  The moment the Heavenly Dao Library separated from his soul, he understood.</p><p>Do people create the world, or does the world precede people?  Is it the wind that moves, or the heart? This question, timeless and profound, has plagued countless individuals.</p><p>But now… none of that matters!</p><p>Without life, without emotion, what meaning does a world have, even if it exists?  Therefore, beyond romance, is universal compassion!  The interwoven emotions of the world.</p><p>All things possess emotion.  Emotion creates the world; emotion sustains life.</p><p>Love is emotion.</p><p>Hate is emotion.</p><p>Joy is emotion.</p><p>Pain is emotion.</p><p>Farewell is emotion.</p><p>Reunion is emotion!</p><p>"Countless emotions, all for my use…"</p><p>A low cry escaped his lips, and the restraints on his cultivation shattered. The Emperor's shackles were broken!</p><p>Instantly, he touched a new world, a new door. His soul was rapidly nourished.  Countless chaotic energies surged toward him, his body strengthening rapidly.  Before, only absorbing spiritual energy brought progress. Now, spatial turbulence, chaotic energy, even the opponent's green light—all became his to command.</p><p>"You…" Hen Ren never expected that her full-powered attack didn't kill him, but instead empowered him. Furious, she screamed and attacked again.</p><p>"Your resentment towards the high and mighty Emperors for not saving you in the spatial turbulence is emotion; your feelings of inferiority and anger as my former servant are emotion; your desire to destroy the divine realm to vent your rage is emotion; your desire for greater power is also emotion… Emotion controls you. How can you overcome me, how can you escape my control?"</p><p>A faint smile spread across Zhang Xuan's face. His voice grew faster, louder.  With a gentle grasp of his hand…</p><p>The once invincible Hen Ren was bound by countless threads of emotion, restrained and immobile.  All emotion was to be used by him, controlled by him!</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Terror filled Hen Ren's eyes. "Master Zhang, I am your servant, please don't kill me… I offer my soul as a sacrifice…"</p><p>"It's too late for that…" Zhang Xuan smiled faintly, shaking his head.  Control over the world's emotions rendered the concept of a servant meaningless.  After killing so many gods, harming his girlfriend Luo Qiqi and so many friends, how could he forgive her today?</p><p>"No…"</p><p>Sensing his resolve, Hen Ren's pupils constricted. Before she could finish, a violent pain struck her.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In an instant, she exploded, transforming into countless strands of spiritual energy that poured into the divine realm.  The power previously absorbed by the Tidal Sea was returned, rejuvenating the desolate lands.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>"She's… dead?"</p><p>Yun Chi Dadi, the Immortal Emperor, Linglong Xianzi, and others stared, disbelieving.  They had fought Hen Ren and knew her terrifying power. To eliminate such a formidable being so easily… what level had Zhang Xuan reached?  Could there be a realm beyond the Emperor?</p><p>"He succeeded…"</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi unclenched their fists.</p><p>"This is a part of the Heavenly Dao. Now, I shall return it…"</p><p>Seeing the "Incomplete Heavenly Dao," previously separated from his body, still suspended in the air, Zhang Xuan smiled slightly and flicked his finger.</p><p>Hum!</p><p>The library, his companion since his rebirth, was embedded into the sky of the divine realm.  A bell-like resonance echoed. The crumbling divine realm visibly began to heal; the chaotic currents coalesced.</p><p>The collapse ceased. The depleted spiritual energy slowly revived with Hen Ren's demise.</p><p>"It seems the divine realm is about to enter a new era of spiritual recovery…" Zhang Xuan smiled.</p><p>The hole in the Tidal Sea, along with the Heavenly Dao's restoration, was healed. The divine realm’s return to its former glory was merely a matter of time.</p><p>"Zhang Xuan, come here…"</p><p>A voice echoed in his mind. Zhang Xuan paused, then took a step.</p><p>The step carried him an immeasurable distance.  A young man stood before him—the one who had taught him swordsmanship.</p><p>"Senior, you…"</p><p>Zhang Xuan was taken aback.</p><p>I sensed his unfathomable power before, but now I realize he's only a hair's breadth away from my level.  He's reached the peak of Emperor-level strength, far surpassing Luo Ruoxi.</p><p>"Just call me by my name. I am... Nie Tong!"  The young man exuded an unstoppable sword intent, speaking calmly.</p><p>"Nie Tong?" Zhang Xuan frowned.</p><p>He'd never heard that name before.</p><p>"Come with me. I'll introduce you to my brother!"  The young man, Nie Tong, smiled gently and strode forward.</p><p>Zhang Xuan followed closely behind.  After what felt like an eternity of flight, they stopped before a mountain peak.</p><p>There, he saw another young man.</p><p>His appearance wasn't much different from Nie Tong's, but his raised eyebrows gave him a profound, unreadable air.</p><p>"His power..." Zhang Xuan shuddered.</p><p>This young man's strength surpassed even his own! He, too, had broken through the Emperor-level barrier, possessing even deeper and more profound cultivation!</p><p>"I am Nie Yun," the young man smiled faintly, his gaze settling on Zhang Xuan. "And I am… Nie Lingxi's father, the father you know as Luo Ruoxi's father."</p><p>"Ruoxi's father?"</p><p>Zhang Xuan was shocked. "You… are the Heavenly Dao of the God Realm?"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi had mentioned her father was the Heavenly Dao. He never imagined it would be such a young man.</p><p>"I achieved the Three Pure Ones from One Qi. Part of my soul became the Heavenly Dao! Besides, I created this world, so calling me the Heavenly Dao isn't inaccurate," Nie Yun smiled calmly.</p><p>Zhang Xuan was incredulous.</p><p>This man created the God Realm?</p><p>Then how powerful must he be?</p><p>"But if you created the God Realm and are the Heavenly Dao, why did you allow the powerful villains to run rampant without intervening...?" Zhang Xuan questioned.</p><p>If he hadn't broken through, the God Realm might have completely collapsed. Why did this man remain indifferent?</p><p>He didn't even seem to care about his daughter's life or death?</p><p>Without answering, Nie Yun looked at him calmly: "Do you believe... that there are even more powerful beings above the God Realm?"</p><p>"Well..." Zhang Xuan hesitated. "Probably..."</p><p>He'd never seen them, but if this man could reach this level, perhaps others could, even stronger ones.  Like the one before him.</p><p>"I once suspected that more powerful beings existed above the God Realm. So I used all my strength to try and glimpse them, ultimately attracting a backlash from a higher world… a hand descended from the heavens!"</p><p>Nie Yun continued, "If I had dodged, the entire God Realm would likely have been obliterated, leaving not a single life behind… So I blocked the attack, but because of that, the Heavenly Dao aspect of myself was split apart."</p><p>"Restoring myself is a simple matter of intent, but… I understood that to truly transcend the God Realm's constraints, to explore the origin of that hand and what lies beyond the God Realm… it's something I couldn't do alone. Therefore, I wanted to see if any being could break through the Emperor-level barrier and reach my level!"</p><p>"So, I sent the scattered fragments of the Heavenly Dao's intent to the lowest world… bestowing them upon souls who originally belonged to this world, and one soul who did not. And you, you did not disappoint me!"</p><p>Nie Yun laughed.</p><p>"A soul not belonging to this world? So, my transmigration was because of you?" Zhang Xuan was stunned.</p><p>So that's why he was able to cross over. It was all orchestrated by this man.</p><p>"He he!" Nie Yun chuckled. "Those who are inherently from this world hold a reverence for it, making it much harder to break through its constraints. It was a spontaneous act on my part. I didn't expect you to actually succeed…"</p><p>"I…" Zhang Xuan blushed. "Without Kong Shi's selfless dedication, I couldn't have reached this level…"</p><p>Without Kong Shi's sacrifice, reaching his current level would have been impossible.</p><p>"I gave him the opportunity, but he didn't seize it. His battle with Lingxi was the perfect chance for him to break through, but he chose to retreat. He thought he had a backup plan, that he could escape unscathed, but he actually lost his aggressive spirit. When facing someone who surpasses you, if you lack that spirit, how can you possibly contend with them?"</p><p>Nie Yun stated.</p><p>Zhang Xuan remained silent.</p><p>He had witnessed their fight; Kong Shi had indeed lacked decisiveness.</p><p>Perhaps he didn't want to kill Luo Ruoxi.</p><p>But that single hesitation cost him the chance to advance.</p><p>"If Kong Shi had won, Ruoxi would have died…" After a moment, Zhang Xuan looked up, his brow furrowed.</p><p>Did this man not even care about his daughter's life or death?</p><p>"With me here, she wouldn't have died," Nie Yun smiled faintly. "Your strength is now almost equal to mine. Do you think, in a life-or-death situation, you two could have saved her?"</p><p>"That…" Zhang Xuan chuckled wryly.</p><p>The Emperor's breakthrough and the Emperor himself are two different things. If he were truly willing to intervene, he could have easily saved her at the last moment, ensuring she wouldn't suffer a single scratch.</p><p>“Lingxi is my other wife, Luo Qingcheng's daughter.  That's why she uses the surname Luo… to make her believe I'm still unconscious and avoid any emotional entanglement, I've kept up the charade until now…”</p><p>Nie Yun gave a wry smile.  “I guess I've played the role of a ruthless father quite well…  Look, you should explain this to her. Her affections have clearly shifted to you, and I'm pretty sure she's forgotten all about her old dad… Haha, I’ll disappear for a while. Otherwise, I'm afraid she’ll create utter chaos…”</p><p>Zhang Xuan’s face twitched at the sight of this unreliable father.  “Fine…” he agreed.</p><p>He had no choice; after all, he’d taken his daughter away…</p><p>“The Heavenly Dao Library is a manifestation of my will, my foundation, and also my constraint. You were able to overcome it with your own abilities, proving your capabilities and potential. You have a bright future ahead of you. As her father, I’m relieved she’s with you.”</p><p></p>
