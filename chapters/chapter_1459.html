<h1></h1><p>Generally speaking, a cultivator in the early Nascent Soul stage wouldn't pose much of a threat to him.</p><p>But Qin Sang wouldn't underestimate any opponent, especially those hailing from famous and powerful sects.</p><p>They might lack some experience and trials, acting less ruthless and decisive than rogue cultivators, but they also had a greater chance to inherit powerful treasures from their sect.</p><p>His divine sense perceived a strange wisp, but there were no abnormalities in his surroundings.</p><p>Just then, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly also sent a warning, but her intent carried a human-like hesitation, as if uncertain whether what she saw was real.</p><p>It was very similar to Qin Sang's feeling.</p><p>Encountering this situation for the first time, Qin Sang chose to trust his own intuition and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. Without the slightest hesitation, he shifted his escape light, abruptly moving several *zhang* away.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang saw one side of his pale-golden *qi* shield being covered by a layer of cold mist at a speed visible to the naked eye. Under his very nose, it condensed into thin ice.</p><p>It was different from Shi Xue's Raging Winter Talisman and Elder Mei's conjured ice shield.</p><p>This layer of ice was free of impurities and colors, completely transparent, and one would surely mistake it for being non-existent if they weren't careful. Even through the *qi* shield, Qin Sang could feel the extreme cold capable of freezing a Nascent Soul.</p><p>It was the spot he had occupied just a moment before.</p><p>A cloud of white mist rose silently.</p><p>Inside the white mist were tiny ice crystals, which then formed slender, hair-like ice threads, transforming into mysterious runes that flashed and disappeared.</p><p>At that moment, the extreme cold erupted, as if the void was frozen, giving the feeling that it had lost its flow.</p><p>Only now did a faint wisp of white *qi* appear, its source the pure-white figure that was rushing over at high speed.</p><p>'Hiss...'</p><p>Qin Sang inhaled a breath of cold air, grateful that he was cautious enough to never underestimate any opponent.</p><p>The newcomer's cultivation was similar to the green-robed woman's, but she had almost put Qin Sang in a crisis, something that Elders Mei and Lan hadn't accomplished.</p><p>If he hadn't moved away from that area of space in time, he would probably have been frozen there on the spot.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang could resist the erosion of the cold and break free from its restraint, the two people in the Sword Formation would be able to take the opportunity to escape and surround him.</p><p>At that time, the situation would be reversed, and Qin Sang's plan would fail!</p><p>…</p><p>The person who came was none other than Liuli, who, seeing her senior sister's critical situation, hurriedly took action to save her.</p><p>As she manipulated the incantation, Liuli's eyes were submerged in a dark blue, as deep as the ocean. Her entire temperament changed, becoming solitary and icy cold.</p><p>Glacial Soul Divine Light!</p><p>Formless, imageless, and without substance, the pinnacle Divine Power of the Great Dao of Ice!</p><p>The so-called ice, ice crystals, and white mist were all phenomena caused by the external world being affected at the moment of the Glacial Soul Divine Light's eruption.</p><p>By the time the enemy noticed the phenomenon, they would actually already be hit!</p><p>If Liuli cultivated her Glacial Soul Divine Light to the Great Perfection stage, it would be even harder to detect before its eruption.</p><p>Seeing that the Glacial Soul Divine Light had actually missed, Liuli was slightly stunned, but her movements didn't pause in the slightest. A phoenix-shaped treasure sword appeared in the palm of her hand. She raised her hand and stabbed out, while her figure flashed rapidly along the wisp of white *qi*.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the mist not far away, suppressing his curiosity about this Divine Power.</p><p>With this brief delay, the Seven Soul Killing Formation had completely erupted. Although Elders Mei and Lan were in a disheveled state, they had indeed not perished.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced. Taking advantage of the fact that they were still entangled in the aftermath of the Sword Formation, he recalled the Golden Sun Sword and slashed in a tit-for-tat manner at the incoming sword light. At the same time, one hand reached towards the Corpse Puppet Pouch on his waist, preparing to intercept the others himself and let the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet capture the green-robed woman.</p><p>At this moment, his peripheral vision caught sight of the phoenix-shaped treasure sword in the sword light.</p><p>This one glance caused his expression to suddenly freeze.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind couldn't help but conjure up a figure, and distant memories were awakened.</p><p>That figure was both unfamiliar and familiar. Although there were only a few fragments, every event that occurred was enough to be unforgettable.</p><p>Back then, when he first entered the Violet Palace, Chenyan was holding this sword, blocking Dongyang Bo, so Qin Sang could escape from his control and flee to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly turned his head to look at the pure-white figure.</p><p>That veil couldn't block the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's sight. That perfect face completely corresponded to the person in his memory.</p><p>"It's her!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart trembled. The newcomer was actually Chenyan; Chenyan actually came from the Profound Heaven Palace!</p><p>This was something Qin Sang hadn't expected.</p><p>Chenyan's master had been trapped in the Violet Palace for so long, but her sect hadn't sent anyone to rescue her. She abandoned Chenyan, who was only in the Qi Refining stage at the time, alone in a foreign land, relying on others, struggling to find a way to save her.</p><p>To save her benefactor, she didn't hesitate to sacrifice her reputation, cultivating the dual cultivation demonic art, falling into Dongyang Bo's scheme.</p><p>Qin Sang originally thought Chenyan's master was a rogue cultivator with no relatives or friends, but he didn't expect her to have such a big background.</p><p>The Palace Master of the Profound Heaven Palace was a great cultivator who could definitely pass through the storm belt. Facing the Palace Master of the Profound Heaven Palace, Dongyang Bo would never dare to do anything crooked.</p><p>But Chenyan's master had been missing for so long, and no one had gone to look for her.</p><p>When he decided to come to the North Sea, Qin Sang had anticipated that he might encounter Chenyan. After all, there weren't many Nascent Soul cultivators in the North Sea, but there weren't few either.</p><p>He was worried that Chenyan had been bewitched by Dongyang Bo, cultivating the so-called Stone Bridge Meditation.</p><p>It was Chenyan who gave him the opportunity to build a foundation, and it was Chenyan who cooperated in blocking him, allowing him to escape from Dongyang Bo's clutches, and had the possibility to continue pursuing the path of immortality, Qin Sang did not have any ill will towards Chenyan, and believed that the best result was to forget each other in the pugilistic world (world of martial arts).</p><p>He never expected to be reunited under such circumstances.</p><p>"She has a Heavenly Spirit Root, formed her Nascent Soul nearly three hundred years ago, and is still in the early Nascent Soul stage, but I have overtaken her. Could it be true that, as Dongyang Bo said, she was affected by the hidden dangers of the dual cultivation demonic art?"</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, and his mood was somewhat complicated.</p><p>In an instant, his thoughts ran wild, but his actions didn't slow down.</p><p>He and Chenyan had this and that entanglement (complications), but they had hardly any communication, and were very unfamiliar with each other. He wouldn't change his plan because of Chenyan.</p><p>*‘Clang!’*</p><p>The Golden Sun Sword didn't deviate, blocking the phoenix-shaped treasure sword.</p><p>The two streams of sword *qi* were like two storms, colliding fiercely together. The phoenix-shaped treasure sword was indeed no match and flew backwards.</p><p>Liuli, who had followed closely behind, had a dark blue glow rising in the depths of her eyes again. She had already used the Glacial Soul Divine Light again. Her expression was faintly pained; continuously using this Divine Power was also a great burden on her.</p><p>"Junior Sister, be careful!"</p><p>Seeing that it was her Junior Sister who had arrived, Shi Xue was overjoyed, but a strong sense of worry arose in her heart. She hurriedly reminded her.</p><p>This demonic fiend was too terrifying; Junior Sister was no match!</p><p>Just at this moment.</p><p>The dark blue in Liuli's eyes suddenly fluctuated violently. She suddenly raised her head and looked directly at the figure whose face was covered by a mask.</p><p>For a moment, her eyes were somewhat dazed.</p><p>Two pairs of eyes met.</p><p>After more than two hundred years, they were looking at each other again, but it was on the battlefield.</p><p>"Huh? She seems to have recognized me?"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Chenyan's reaction and muttered silently.</p><p>That dangerous premonition appeared once again, and he unhesitatingly controlled the sword to slash.</p><p>The sword transformed into a myriad of forms, cutting away the extreme cold!</p><p>At this time, the two Elders were just about to regroup and aim their magical artifacts at Qin Sang.</p><p>But just at this moment, the hand that was about to open the Corpse Puppet Pouch suddenly froze.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes surged with a strong wariness, as if facing a formidable enemy!</p>
