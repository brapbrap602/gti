<h1>Chapter 2099: Ancient Covenant</h1><p>Qin Sang ignored Zai Zhen, controlling the Azure Phoenix manifestation to gaze at the horizon. The dark gold short spear, after a single strike, shot back, disappearing from Qin Sang’s sight. He hadn't seen the attacker but could sense a faint aura lingering there, and it seemed there was more than one expert.</p><p>The other party was clearly prepared, forcing Qin Sang to reassess the current situation.</p><p>Min Zhuo being able to summon so many helpers was beyond Qin Sang's expectations. After all, the Changyou Clan previously didn't even have a Void Realm Second Stage expert, and Min Zhuo wasn't a powerful leader either. Yet, he possessed such extensive connections, revealing that those smaller tribes of the Foreign Tribes shouldn't be underestimated.</p><p>For countless years, they had dwelled in the Sea of Mists, isolated from the world, forming intricate internal connections, woven into a dense net.  Who knew what relationships lay hidden behind these tribes.</p><p>But at the same time, Qin Sang also noticed that the attitude of the dark gold short spear's owner was quite intriguing. The person took action to rescue Min Zhuo upon seeing him in danger, but disengaged after a single strike, a mere symbolic gesture.</p><p>Was the other party hiding in the shadows to exert pressure, waiting for an opportunity? Or did they, seeing his own strength, deem him a formidable opponent and were unwilling to create enmity?</p><p>With the Changyou Clan's foundation, it wasn't difficult for Min Zhuo to summon helpers, but Qin Sang didn't believe these experts would willingly serve Min Zhuo.</p><p>Azure Spirit Qi, while undoubtedly valuable, was useless to Void Refinement cultivators. Even if Min Zhuo was willing to share, the other party would have to provoke two powerful enemies for it, a prospect they might not be eager to embrace.</p><p>Furthermore, Li Yufu had mentioned earlier that when the Azure Spirit Qi was first discovered, it was abundant, but the amount they obtained later dwindled.  It was unclear whether it was due to the impact of their battles or if the Azure Spirit Qi itself was finite, thus dissipating gradually.</p><p>With powerful enemies present, they hadn't had a chance to investigate thoroughly.</p><p>If the Azure Spirit Qi was truly diminishing, it wouldn't satisfy the appetites of those powerful clans, and its value would greatly decrease.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang controlled the Azure Phoenix manifestation to retract its gaze, looking towards Zai Zhen, "May I ask this fellow Daoist's name?"</p><p>Zai Zhen beckoned with his hand, recalling the Three Afflictions Ring and gripping it tightly, "Yonghe Clan, Zai Zhen!"</p><p>"So it's the Yonghe Clan Chief, my apologies."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was flat, lacking any discernible respect.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix manifestation's wings slowly folded, the surrounding thunder and lightning gradually diminishing in intensity.  Flickering lightning was absorbed into the phoenix wings, tiny threads of lightning dancing between the azure feathers.</p><p>Seeing his actions, Si Lu and Min Zhuo also ceased their attacks.</p><p>Water and fire began to separate.  The Crimson-Feathered Bird swallowed mouthfuls of fire, burped, shook its wings, and flew to the Azure Phoenix manifestation's side. The white marten vanished without a trace once more.</p><p>Min Zhuo hastily recalled his jade bowl and eight-sided jade screen, his heart still pounding. He had almost felt the Azure Phoenix's thunder claws piercing him just moments ago.</p><p>Both sides stood in a standoff across the void.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix manifestation’s gaze fell upon Min Zhuo once more.</p><p>His gaze wasn't as sharp as before, but whether directed at Zai Zhen or Min Zhuo, it made them tense, as if they were being targeted by a peerless凶兽.</p><p>"Does Your Excellency intend to engage in a decisive battle with this humble Daoist?"</p><p>The Azure Phoenix manifestation's gaze narrowed slightly, its tone suddenly chilling, instantly filled with killing intent.</p><p>Min Zhuo's face twitched. Confronting him directly, he realized that Zai Zhen's previous description had been somewhat understated.</p><p>Pressed directly, he instinctively wanted to look at Zai Zhen, but thankfully, he remembered Zai Zhen’s prior instructions.  He spoke stiffly, "Above our ancestors, this region has been the territory of my Changyou Clan since ancient times, yet it has been occupied by you invaders. This old man, lacking sufficient cultivation before, could only endure this humiliation. Now, I've invited Brother Zai to help me drive away the invaders, which is perfectly justifiable!  As long as you leave, we naturally won't make things difficult for you, and past grievances can be written off!"</p><p>Zai Zhen chimed in, "Do the two fellow Daoists intend to disregard the Ancient Covenant, bully the weak, and seize the territory of another clan?"</p><p>The Azure Phoenix manifestation and the Crimson-Feathered Bird exchanged glances. Both Qin Sang and Si Lu detected a hint of forced bravado in Min Zhuo’s tone.</p><p>This confirmed Qin Sang's judgment; those experts were, at most, there for support.</p><p>Qin Sang, through the Azure Phoenix manifestation, let out a cold laugh, "Bully the weak? Clan Chief Min, it was you who massacred countless of my junior demon cultivators just moments ago, that is bullying the weak!  This debt, this humble Daoist will certainly remember!"</p><p>Si Lu also controlled his companion beast to speak, "Since Clan Chief Zai mentioned the Ancient Covenant, I clearly remember that the Ancient Covenant forbids forcing others to leave their ancestral lands. This sea region is the Changyou Clan's territory, but it can also be the home of others who have resided here since their ancestors, and there is ample evidence to prove this!"</p><p>"Nonsense!"</p><p>Min Zhuo flew into a rage.</p><p>Zai Zhen calmly identified the loophole in Si Lu’s words, questioning, "They are of a different race, not our kind. Logically, they are not protected by the Ancient Covenant. Fellow Daoist's words are untenable. Furthermore, fellow Daoist is a member of the Siyou Clan, not one of our Superior Clans. Interfering in this matter is unjustified and improper. If you persist in your folly, we will certainly report you to the Superior Clans in the future. Let's see how you will handle yourself then!"</p><p>Si Lu chuckled, unmoved, "Has Clan Chief Zai forgotten several stipulations within the Ancient Covenant? I have decided to establish my Daoist Sanctuary here. Fellow Daoist Qin is the master of this place and my protector, having already decided to pledge allegiance to me, becoming my vassal clan. Why can't I intervene?"</p><p>"Preposterous! These foreign races are not our kind, how can they be considered a vassal clan!"</p><p>Min Zhuo couldn't help but shout, the contents of the Ancient Covenant flashing through his mind. He realized that several clauses were surprisingly fitting for the current situation.</p><p>First, the Ancient Covenant stipulated that if members of other clans sought refuge and a place to live, as long as the request was reasonable and didn't harm the host's interests, they couldn't be driven away under the pretext of being a different race.</p><p>This was to prevent the clans from becoming isolated, leading to deepening divides and even mutual hostility.</p><p>Second, any clan had the right to choose a Superior Clan and pledge allegiance to them.  If they already had a Superior Clan, they must first sever ties with their original Superior Clan, provided they had justifiable reasons, such as being oppressed by the Superior Clan.</p><p>This was to protect the rights of the smaller clans, but in reality, severing ties with a Superior Clan was difficult, requiring reporting to the Feathered Clan and other Superior Clans for joint judgment.</p><p>The Storm Realm didn't belong to any Superior Clan, so pledging allegiance to this Siyou Clan expert wouldn't require the Zhuyan Clan's permission.</p><p>The territories of the major Superior Clans in the Foreign Tribes were separated by tides of mist, but they weren't entirely isolated. Each Superior Clan's territory was just a general area. Accepting a vassal clan within another's territory sounded incredible, but it wasn't unheard of, as long as the vassal clan could withstand the pressure.</p><p>Because of the Ancient Covenant and the deterrence of the Sacred Earthquake, it was difficult for wars of extermination to occur between clans. Without the worry of annihilation, there were always bold individuals willing to take risks.</p><p>The Storm Realm didn't belong to the Foreign Tribes, but the Ancient Covenant didn't seem to strictly limit it to them. Perhaps the ancestors who established the Covenant hadn't foreseen that other races would dare to establish Daoist Sanctuaries within the Sea of Mists.</p><p>In the worst-case scenario, even if the Storm Realm couldn't legitimately become a vassal clan, as long as Si Lu was willing, he could completely claim that the Storm Realm was his subordinate, exploiting a loophole.</p><p>This was the strategy Qin Sang and Si Lu had devised after discussion, using the Ancient Covenant to transform the conflict between the Storm Realm and the Changyou Clan from an enemy-versus-outsider conflict into an internal conflict within the Foreign Tribes.</p><p>The only concern was that pushing Si Lu to the forefront might expose his identity.</p><p>Qin Sang had considered this long ago.</p><p>This was the Zhuyan Clan's territory. Even if Si Lu's enemies learned of his identity, the Zhuyan Clan wouldn't tolerate the Siyou Clan's army marching into their territory; they would at most dispatch some experts.</p><p>Si Lu's identity being exposed and the Siyou Clan negotiating with the Zhuyan Clan would all take time, and time was precisely what Qin Sang lacked.</p><p>As long as the Thunder Altar was built, he wouldn't fear even if Siyou Clan experts came seeking revenge!</p><p>Qin Sang keeping Si Lu was because he had anticipated this situation. As for Si Lu's enemies, Qin Sang hadn't inquired in detail, but he could guess the general situation. The two understood each other tacitly.</p><p>Changing enemies from the Changyou Clan to the more powerful Siyou Clan seemingly put Qin Sang in a more difficult position, but for his Daoist Sanctuary, for the survival of the beings within the Storm Realm, it was a necessary step.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't confident in keeping all of the helpers Min Zhuo had called.</p><p>Even if he had the ability to kill them all, the consequences would be unbearable for them.</p><p>He could defend for a time, but not forever.</p><p>But from another perspective, the Siyou Clan's internal affairs were complex. Si Lu's enemies didn't represent the entire Siyou Clan. If he helped Si Lu eliminate his enemies and aided his return to the Siyou Clan to regain power, it would be equivalent to gaining a powerful ally within the Foreign Tribes!</p><p>For Si Lu, having Qin Sang, a top-tier expert, assisting him was naturally a desirable outcome.</p><p>The two hit it off immediately.</p><p>However, the success of their plan hinged on the Zhuyan Clan's approval.</p><p>The other party clearly understood this as well.  Zai Zhen scoffed, "Pledge allegiance? Vassal clan? Have you asked the Zhuyan Clan if they agree?"</p><p>The Crimson-Feathered Bird raised its head proudly, "I will personally seek the Zhuyan Clan’s consent!  This is a matter between our Superior Clans, it doesn't concern you."</p><p>"You!"</p><p>The other party was clearly disdainful of his status. Anger burned in Zai Zhen's eyes as he raged, "It seems fellow Daoist is determined to protect them!"</p><p>"You're welcome to try!"</p><p>The Crimson-Feathered Bird retorted, unflinching.</p><p>Qin Sang also backed Si Lu, the Azure Phoenix manifestation spreading its wings wide, thunder rumbling in the sky.</p><p>Zai Zhen's expression shifted slightly as he turned to Min Zhuo, "What are your intentions, Brother Min?"</p><p>Min Zhuo's face was grim as he took a deep look at the Azure Phoenix manifestation. "As long as you are willing to take your people and leave this place, other matters are negotiable.  Regarding those demon cultivators who died at this old man’s hand, I can offer appropriate compensation as an apology to the two of you. Otherwise, I will definitely settle the score with you two another day!"</p><p>Min Zhuo's words carried a hidden meaning, which Qin Sang understood to be referring to the Azure Spirit Qi. It seemed that seeing the situation turning unfavorable, Min Zhuo had thoughts of reconciliation, which was precisely what Qin Sang wanted.</p><p>Zai Zhen frowned inwardly. Min Zhuo's words differed somewhat from what he had instructed, but their primary objective had essentially been achieved, so he didn't delve deeper.</p><p>After making his statement, Min Zhuo waved his hand, "Let's go!"</p><p>Mist rose beneath their feet as they slowly retreated.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix manifestation's eyes gleamed with ferocity, eager to give chase. The Crimson-Feathered Bird flew closer and whispered something, seemingly persuading Qin Sang to swallow his anger for the time being.</p><p>Since Qin Sang had already 'pledged allegiance' to Si Lu, he naturally heeded his advice, coldly watching Min Zhuo and Zai Zhen retreat.</p><p>Out of the Azure Phoenix manifestation's sight, both Min Zhuo and Zai Zhen felt a sense of relief.  Despite being the instigators, they had felt the most pressure.</p><p>Zai Zhen's expression flickered, and he bowed towards a calm patch of the sea, "Thank you, fellow Daoist, for your assistance!"</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>Ripples spread across the sea surface as the aura abruptly dissipated. The other party had quietly departed.</p><p>Min Zhuo stared at the sea, unable to determine how many people were hiding there from beginning to end. He murmured, "Which fellow Daoist was that?"</p><p>Zai Zhen shook his head, offering no explanation, "Let's leave quickly as well. If they pursue us, with just the two of us, I'm afraid the odds are stacked against us."</p><p>They immediately summoned their escape lights and flew westward.</p><p>Min Zhuo had countless questions. He had originally thought that Zai Zhen, bringing so many experts, intended to lure the other party out for an ambush, yet they retreated after this charade.</p><p>Was it because they discovered the other party's strength far exceeded their estimations, and they didn't dare to act? Min Zhuo was truly puzzled. Was there actually enmity between them?</p><p>"Brother Zai, what should we do next?" Min Zhuo couldn't help but ask.</p><p>The threat of the Storm Realm remained, and it was even more terrifying than before.</p><p>What worried him most was that during the next ebb of the polluted Qi, when both sides competed for the Azure Spirit Qi, if that demon cultivator personally intervened, he would very likely discover Mount Daiyu, and he simply didn't have the strength to compete with him.</p><p>After much deliberation, Min Zhuo found that he had no choice but to pin his hopes on Zai Zhen and the person behind him eliminating the other party.</p><p>Zai Zhen’s face wore a relaxed smile, as if he had completed some task. He hummed and said, “Brother Min can recall the North Sea army. There's no need to provoke them during this time.”</p><p>This clearly wasn't what Min Zhuo wanted to know.</p><p>Zai Zhen thought for a moment, deciding to reveal some information, "As for that person's intentions, I cannot fully comprehend. Brother Min might as well return and calmly await news; there will certainly be further developments. Rest assured, Brother Min, since they have been targeted by that person, they will have nowhere to escape..."</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix manifestation and the Crimson-Feathered Bird stared at the horizon for a long while, their true forms quietly appearing behind them.</p><p>“It seems Min Zhuo’s trip was to probe our strength," Si Lu said.</p><p>Min Zhuo choosing to retreat this time didn’t mean he would give up. His next arrival might be for negotiation, or he might gather even more experts; it depended on Min Zhuo’s choice.</p><p>However, with the Changyou Clan’s foundation, inviting top-tier experts wasn’t easy. They would at least have a period of peace.</p><p>What they needed to do now was to delay as much as possible.</p><p>The main altar and the three branch altars were nearing completion. The villains within the Storm Realm had mostly been exposed. The next step was to consolidate the Storm Realm and focus all efforts on constructing the altars.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix manifestation transformed into a streak of azure light and merged into Qin Sang’s body. He said, “I’ll trouble fellow Daoist to make a trip to the Zhuyan Clan and explain this matter.”</p><p>Si Lu nodded, his expression solemn. This trip was crucial; the Zhuyan Clan’s attitude would determine the success or failure of their plan.</p>
