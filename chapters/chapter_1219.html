<h1>Chapter 1211: The Old Demon Ye</h1><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath and quickly retrieved the Twelve Demon Banners along with the white copper. Without time to inspect them, his figure merged with his spirit sword, instantly darting away.</p><p>A cyan light finally erupted, narrowly missing Qin Sang's back.</p><p>The close call sent a shiver down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>However, it hadn't escaped his control, and he had successfully seized the white copper.</p><p>He hoped the white copper wouldn't disappoint him.</p><p>The entire treasure-seizing process had been completed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>The excruciating pain and the theft of its treasure drove the malevolent spirit into a complete frenzy. Its hatred for Qin Sang burned deeper than its enmity toward the Snake King and his companions.</p><p>For the Snake King and his group, this was the best possible news.</p><p>While Qin Sang made his move, they hadn't been idle either.</p><p>The Lu-named cultivator and the Frost Lizard worked together to block the malevolent spirit's tail. Then, taking advantage of the spirit's focus on Qin Sang, they both lunged toward the exit of the Abyssal Ruins below.</p><p>The Snake King, having unleashed some unknown secret technique, wielded his black blade with unparalleled ferocity. He fought against two opponents single-handedly, forcing Jiang Chenzi and his companion into a desperate defensive stance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the other Nascent Soul cultivator from the Sin Abyss seemed to have just snapped out of his daze. In a flurry, he activated the treasure flag in his hand, which was identical to Jiang Chenzi's.</p><p>The three Nascent Soul cultivators from the Sin Abyss were both shocked and furious as they watched Qin Sang snatch the treasure right under their noses. They were astounded by the divine abilities and treasures Qin Sang had displayed, which not only possessed extraordinary power but also seemed to suppress the malevolent spirit. They had long considered the treasures within the serpent spirit to be their exclusive spoils.</p><p>This newcomer had not only ruined their perfect plan but had also taken one of the treasures, leaving them powerless to stop him.</p><p>The Snake King, however, felt entirely differently.</p><p>He, too, was stunned by Qin Sang's hidden strength. It was laughable that he had once asked the Puppeteer Demon King to challenge Qin Sang in a duel. Had he taken the field himself, he likely wouldn't have stood much of a chance either.</p><p>After forcing Jiang Chenzi and his companion back, the Snake King immediately recalled his black blade and followed the Frost Lizard and the Lu-named cultivator toward the exit. At the same time, he sent a hurried voice transmission, "Fellow Daoist, your skills are impressive! This is no place to linger. Let's go!"</p><p>Despite seeing that Qin Sang could suppress the malevolent spirit, the Snake King and his group had no intention of staying to assist him in seizing more treasures.</p><p>First, the malevolent spirit, though its intelligence had been eroded by malice, was not truly dead. Its instincts remained intact. Using the same tactics a second time would yield diminishing returns. Prolonging the fight would only make it harder to achieve their goals.</p><p>Second, they had already secured what appeared to be the most important treasure. There was no need to risk their lives for two items whose purposes were unknown.</p><p>Having cultivated to this level, they naturally understood the principle of knowing when to advance and when to retreat.</p><p>The Snake King kindly reminded Qin Sang to leave with them.</p><p>Although Qin Sang's primary goal had been the treasure, the fact remained that he had saved them in a moment of crisis. Regardless of his motives, they owed him gratitude.</p><p>Qin Sang was currently struggling to evade the malevolent spirit's relentless pursuit.</p><p>Facing the spirit alone, Qin Sang felt the pressure mounting.</p><p>He had once encountered a Demon Lord in the Seven Slaughter Palace, but it was Qing Zhu and the other experts who had truly confronted the Demon Lord. This malevolent spirit was, without a doubt, the strongest opponent Qin Sang had ever faced.</p><p>Hearing the Snake King's voice transmission, Qin Sang nodded inwardly.</p><p>He had guessed correctly. The Snake King and his group indeed had a secret passage into the Abyssal Ruins. Qin Sang had initially thought it was hidden within the Blood Lake, but it turned out to be located below. Without hesitation, Qin Sang retracted his aura and followed the Snake King toward the exit.</p><p>Having thoroughly searched the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters, he knew he could easily leave from here without needing to take a longer route.</p><p>At that moment, the Lu-named cultivator and the Frost Lizard reached the exit ahead of them. Qin Sang and the Snake King were slightly behind, with the serpent spirit and the Sin Abyss Nascent Soul cultivators hot on their heels.</p><p>Just as the Lu-named cultivator and the Frost Lizard were about to enter the exit, Qin Sang suddenly felt an ominous premonition.</p><p>"Something's wrong! What's the problem? What have I overlooked?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened.</p><p>The feeling was overwhelming, as if some danger was lurking nearby, and he had failed to notice it.</p><p>This was the Sin Abyss's stronghold. How could Qin Sang not be cautious?</p><p>Before making his move, Qin Sang had even activated the Witch Clan's insect-controlling secret technique, using the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's abilities to scan every inch of the surroundings. He had confirmed that no additional enemies were hiding in the shadows, and no other Nascent Soul cultivators were approaching.</p><p>Throughout the entire operation, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had remained vigilant.</p><p>Despite such caution and thoroughness, a flaw had still emerged.</p><p>Just as these thoughts crossed Qin Sang's mind, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly sent a strong warning.</p><p>'Splash...'</p><p>Behind the battlefield, the once-calm Blood Lake suddenly churned.</p><p>In an instant, a bloody storm formed.</p><p>The blood water gathered into towering waves, rising high into the air and forming a blood-red gate.</p><p>Inside the gate, endless blood churned and then parted to the sides, revealing a figure that seemed to move slowly but was actually flying out with incredible speed.</p><p>As the blood gate and the figure appeared, the area in front of the exit was suddenly and inexplicably flooded with blood. The Frost Lizard and the Lu-named cultivator, caught off guard, were swept into it.</p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Chenzi and his two companions showed no surprise. They immediately abandoned their pursuit, splitting apart and each holding a treasure flag. They formed a three-talents formation, setting up a blood-colored flag array!</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator who had been hiding in the shadows had previously appeared clumsy.</p><p>The Snake King and the others had assumed that Qin Sang's sudden and fierce attack had caused the situation to change too quickly, leaving this person unprepared and always a step behind.</p><p>But now, as they looked at this person's sharp expression and swift movements, it was clear that his earlier clumsiness had been an act.</p><p>Even Jiang Chenzi and the others' pursuit had been a feint, meant to lull their opponents into a false sense of security, waiting for this very moment!</p><p>The figure flew out of the blood gate, and its face became increasingly clear.</p><p>"Old Demon Ye!"</p><p>Upon recognizing the figure, the Snake King exclaimed in shock, his face paling.</p><p>Both he and Qin Sang had stopped in time. Fortunately, they had been behind the Lu-named cultivator and the Frost Lizard. Seeing the danger, they halted immediately and avoided being swept into the blood.</p><p>Hearing the Snake King's exclamation, Qin Sang's gaze sharpened, and he was momentarily stunned.</p><p>Old Demon Ye was here!</p><p>Years ago, Old Demon Ye had orchestrated a surprise attack on the Purple Palace, nearly wiping out the high-level cultivators of both regions. The incident had left a deep impression on Qin Sang.</p><p>This man's cultivation was on par with the Red-Haired Ancestor and the True One Elder, both of whom were just a step away from becoming Great Cultivators. Yet, they regarded Old Demon Ye as their lifelong nemesis, deeply wary of him.</p><p>The Sin Abyss's relentless campaigns, which had plunged the Northern Star Realm into chaos, were all directed by this man.</p><p>Qin Sang prided himself on having few people to fear in the Northern Star Realm, but Old Demon Ye was undoubtedly one of them. It was best to avoid him at all costs.</p><p>However, since the war began, Old Demon Ye had never left the front lines.</p><p>During the previous surprise attack, it was said that the True One Elder himself had confronted Old Demon Ye in a fierce battle.</p><p>Knowing that Old Demon Ye was tied up at the front, Qin Sang and the Snake King had felt confident in infiltrating the Abyssal Ruins. No one had expected Old Demon Ye to suddenly emerge from the Blood Lake.</p><p>Moreover, Old Demon Ye didn't seem to have just returned. His aura was deeply connected to the Blood Lake, indicating that he had been here for a long time.</p><p>"Could there be two peak mid-Nascent Soul Old Demon Yes?"</p><p>A ridiculous thought crossed Qin Sang's mind.</p>
