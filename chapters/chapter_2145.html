<h1>Chapter 2135: News from Purple Cloud Mountain</h1><p>Si Lu and others continuously exerted great magical power, cleaning the battlefield and then reorganizing the remnants of King Lu’s army.</p><p>The direct descendants of the Lu family were selected to remain in the Storm Realm, serving alongside the demon soldiers.  Those who were Lu family vassals and other clans could still be utilized. Si Lu promised to let them join the Si family of Yan Mountain; their status would be lower than in the Lu family, but far better than annihilation, quickly winning their hearts.</p><p>Compared to the aggressive momentum when King Lu led his army to attack, now they were just defeated remnants, yet they still possessed some semblance of strength.</p><p>Previously driven by self-interest, strong cultivators like Shi Mu were now prisoners, controlled by others, unable to shirk their duties.</p><p>At a glance, they seemed to be a formidable force. Once Si Lu returned with this victory, the remnants of King Yan’s army would surely seek refuge, and the Si family’s power in Yan Mountain would continue to grow.  Except for the lack of top-tier experts, their strength would likely be comparable to their peak.</p><p>The only person who could fill the role of top-tier expert was Qin Sang.</p><p>The feat of eliminating the Grand Protector and King Lu could intimidate some, but as an outsider, he could only act as an honored guest elder.  His actions needed careful consideration, and certain rules couldn't be broken.  Being too flamboyant wouldn't benefit Si Lu.  If public anger was stirred, and the Si Emperor seized the opportunity to attack, it would lead to another bloody conflict, and the Thunder Altar was too far away to provide assistance.</p><p>Si Lu had no ambition to replace the Si Emperor, and Qin Sang wouldn't support such a move.</p><p>“Brother Qin, let's go first!”</p><p>Si Lu reorganized the army, took control of the Lu family's airships, ordered all soldiers aboard, and prepared to depart.</p><p>Su Nu and Zhu Que led some Storm Realm experts, accompanying him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, about to speak, but his expression shifted as he looked towards a distant barren hill.</p><p>Above the barren hill, winds gathered, and radiant light filled the sky.</p><p>This celestial phenomenon, caused by the turbulent flow of Heaven and Earth's energy, signified a breakthrough in cultivation, drawing everyone's attention.</p><p>“It’s Huan Hen…”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly.</p><p>On the barren hill, Huan Hen sat cross-legged on a rock, his spiritual sword resting on his knees, his eyes closed.</p><p>The one breaking through was Huan Hen, with Jian Nu protecting him from afar.</p><p>They had no formal master-disciple relationship, but their bond was that of master and disciple. During the previous battle, they hadn't stayed in the rear to manage the altar, but instead participated in the fighting, honing their swordsmanship.</p><p>Their battlefield experiences differed greatly from Qin Sang's. There were countless unprecedented magical artifacts, and cultivators comparable to Nascent Soul stage experts continuously appeared, with many enemies of equal or greater strength.</p><p>Although protected by Thunder Talismans, they couldn't be constantly guarded, often facing life-threatening dangers. This kind of tempering was precisely what they sought; having experienced the rigors of war, Huan Hen's swordsmanship had greatly improved, completing this journey of sword sharpening!</p><p>There were numerous Transformation Stage cultivators present, so Huan Hen's breakthrough didn't cause much of a stir.</p><p>With his mind transforming into a sword, he cut through all obstacles, stepping into the Transformation Stage!</p><p>Huan Hen soared into the air on his sword, the sword light like a dragon, his spirit soaring.</p><p>At that moment, some cultivators among the crowd looked grave, realizing that although Huan Hen's cultivation wasn't exceptionally high, his strength was beyond normal expectations.</p><p>“Greetings, Master Uncle Qin!  I am overjoyed, but I beg for your punishment, Master Uncle!”</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, Huan Hen quickly retracted his sword light, flew to Qin Sang, and knelt in the air.</p><p>According to the lineage left by Qing Zhu, Shangguan Li Feng ranked below Qin Sang, so Huan Hen addressed him as Master Uncle.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't punish him for such a trivial matter. He smiled and said, “Your achievement today is a testament to your exceptional talent and character. Your master and Daoist Friend Jian Nu's efforts have not been in vain.  You may return to the sect first, consolidate your gains, and then come to my cave dwelling.”</p><p>“Disciple obeys!”</p><p>Huan Hen was secretly thrilled; this meant Qin Sang would personally guide him.</p><p>At this time, Jian Nu also flew forward, bowing, "After this battle, this old servant has also gained something, but I cannot accompany you to the Lu Manor in Hanjiang."</p><p>“Daoist Friend is also about to break through?”</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed. Once Jian Nu reached the Nascent Soul stage, he would have another powerful general by his side.</p><p>“I can sense the boundary, but whether I can break through is still unknown,” Jian Nu said modestly.</p><p>…</p><p>Jian Nu and Huan Hen returned to Qingyang Temple, while Si Lu, Su Nu, and others also bid farewell.  Airships, countless in number, filled the sky and soared into the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards the sea, took a step in the air, and vanished.</p><p>…</p><p>East Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared on the sea surface, looked up at the sky, and suddenly a green light descended from the heavens, entering his forehead.</p><p>After the green light dissipated, Qin Sang was holding Min Zhuo with one hand and playing with the Qianjun Ring with the other, pondering for a moment before disappearing again.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The illusory form of the Thunder Altar dissipated, and Qingyang Temple returned to its original scenery. The physical altar sat quietly in the valley, peaceful and serene.</p><p>It was hard to believe that the fourth-order thunder talisman, the Thunder Oath Seal, which had shattered Lu Wang's army and killed top-tier experts, had been launched from this altar.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in the valley, surveyed the area, and rapidly executed several hand seals.</p><p>The valley's formation shifted, undergoing a transformation of light and shadow as it expanded outwards.  Qin Sang moved several surrounding peaks, clearing a large space.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>Daiyu Mountain materialized, descending to the ground with a powerful tremor.</p><p>White mist swirled, shrouding the valley in a hazy fog.</p><p>Qin Sang moved to the stone platform, sat before the stele, and entered a meditative state to sense the stele.</p><p>His perfected body was even more powerful than his previous Dharma manifestation.  As expected, he made new discoveries, though not enough to allow him to refine the mountain or fully comprehend its mysteries.</p><p>Since the mountain had been brought back, there was no need to rush. Qin Sang activated more ancient prohibitions to seal the mountain, preventing any energy fluctuations from escaping, intending to explore it later.</p><p>Qin Sang reached into a crack in the mountain, and a shimmering green light appeared. A mass of verdant energy floated out, circling before him.</p><p>He extracted all the verdant energy from the crack, adding it to what he had already collected.  All of it was now here.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's recent investigations, the verdant energy was most likely created during ascension and was related to the surrounding environment at the time.  Until he understood the secrets of the mountain, there shouldn't be any more, making each one precious.</p><p>For the cultivators of the Storm World, this amount of verdant energy was still far too little.  Now that the war had ended, the previous distribution method needed revision. Qin Sang planned to establish rules to use the energy as rewards and incentives.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang believed that relying solely on verdant energy for each breakthrough wasn't necessarily beneficial.  The Storm World cultivators who had advanced this way often lacked a solid foundation.  However, the external threats had forced them to take shortcuts.</p><p>The mountain was shrouded in mist.</p><p>Qin Sang left the valley and partially released Min Zhuo from his restraints, awakening him.</p><p>Min Zhuo knew he was at Qin Sang's mercy and had no room to negotiate.  Concealing or delaying information would only prolong his suffering, so he answered Qin Sang's questions truthfully.</p><p>Qin Sang was most interested in the mountain's origin and the various texts treasured by the Changyou Clan.  His initial question about Min Zhuo's actions before the battle was casual, but Min Zhuo's answer made him increasingly gloomy.</p><p>Min Zhuo's breakthrough had not been achieved through his own abilities.  His betrayal to Lu Wang was not the result of his intelligence or insight into Si Lu's background.</p><p>Everything had been orchestrated by someone else!</p><p>"You don't know who that person is?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was icy as he looked into Min Zhuo's eyes.</p><p>Min Zhuo met his gaze calmly, sighing, "I was merely a pawn in that person's game, believing I could escape the board, but it was all in vain."</p><p>"Besides Zai Zhen, how many other experts were sent on that person's orders?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>"Their identities aren't difficult to guess, but I suspect they were all summoned by Zai Zhen and may not know the full story…"</p><p>Min Zhuo revealed everything he knew.</p><p>Qin Sang noted down these individuals' identities.  As an outsider, it was inconvenient for him to investigate personally; he would inform Yuan Miao and the Yuanxiang clan leader.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, Min Zhuo, seemingly seeking death, sneered, "Does the esteemed Qin Sang have so many enemies that he can't remember who is targeting you?  Those with the courage and ability to do this are at least Zhu Yan Clan elders, or a major power capable of rivaling them. Perhaps, soon, I will see you follow in my clan's footsteps, hahaha…"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't engage with a prisoner, but Min Zhuo's words had touched upon his concerns.</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader and Yuan Miao's attitudes towards the Storm World seemed genuine.  So who was behind this?  Was it internal strife within the Zhu Yan Clan, or was there a mysterious enemy watching from the shadows?</p><p>Min Zhuo couldn't answer these questions.</p><p>After re-imprisoning Min Zhuo, Qin Sang sat in his chamber, recalling past events, searching for clues.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang sensed something, looking towards the outside.</p><p>"They should be arriving."</p><p>He murmured, his figure flashing as he appeared outside Qingyang Temple, greeting the Yuanxiang clan leader with a respectful bow.</p><p>After the war, Yuan Miao took his leave, saying he would report to his clan leader. Qin Sang suspected that the Yuanxiang clan leader had been near the battlefield all along.</p><p>Yuan Xiang, his face flushed with wine, sat on a mountaintop rock, a wine gourd in his arms.  He bellowed joyfully, "Qin Zhenren's victory was magnificent and awe-inspiring! We must celebrate!"</p><p>"Chieftain Yuan Xiang, you flatter me.  I owe my success to your delaying the Lu King's army and setting a deadline, forcing their hasty advance. This gave me the opportunity to act decisively; otherwise, the outcome would have been uncertain," Qin Sang replied respectfully.</p><p>"It was nothing significant," Yuan Xiang waved his hand dismissively.  His tone then shifted, and he added with a smile, "Min Zhuo, the Chieftain of the Changyou tribe, is dead.  After this battle, the Changyou tribe is severely weakened and poses no further threat.  How do you intend to deal with them?"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, "I leave it entirely to your judgment, Chieftain Yuan Xiang."</p><p>Yuan Xiang nodded in satisfaction, "Nothing more than territorial concessions and reparations."</p><p>As they spoke, a sound pierced the air. Yuan Miao arrived on a cloud, accompanied by two others; one was Min Shu, the new chieftain of the Changyou tribe, Min Zhuo's son.</p><p>Min Shu, still shaken, trembled at the sight of Qin Sang.  He felt not resentment, but only profound fear.</p><p>"The Changyou sacred grounds are a legacy from our ancestors.  Though I wished to relocate the entire tribe to separate us and allow time to heal the hatred, our ancestral teachings forbid it. I hope, Zhenren, that you will leave Shengmu Plain to the Changyou," Yuan Xiang sighed.</p><p>Qin Sang understood this was the Zhuyan tribe's bottom line. He immediately stated that he would not set foot on Shengmu Plain.</p><p>The Three Realms and the vast surrounding seas, with their countless islands and reefs, were sufficient to accommodate the cultivators of the Storm World. When choosing this location for his cultivation grounds, Qin Sang had anticipated this; his cultivation grounds could not continuously expand within the Mist Sea.  If he continued on the path of Great Ascension, he would inevitably need to select a new location elsewhere.</p><p>With the capture of Chieftain Min Zhuo and the deaths of over half their top experts, and the capture of others, the Changyou tribe had been set back a thousand years.</p><p>Without the Qingling energy, restoring the Changyou tribe to its former glory would be nearly impossible.</p><p>The Changyou tribe no longer qualified as a rival in the Storm World.  Leaving them as an opponent would serve to hone the skills of future generations.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally summoned Li Yu Fu, instructing him to negotiate with Min Shu. His sole requirement was that the Changyou tribe's treasured texts be brought to him.</p><p>Li Yu Fu invited Yuan Miao and Min Shu to the mountain gate.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious. He declared gravely, "I learned some secrets from Min Zhuo, which I wish to report to Chieftain Yuan Xiang."</p><p>Seeing the seriousness of Qin Sang's demeanor, Yuan Xiang put aside his casual air. "Please, Zhenren, speak."</p><p>Qin Sang then relayed the information he obtained from Min Zhuo to Yuan Xiang.</p><p>Yuan Xiang’s expression grew increasingly grave. He remained silent for a long time after Qin Sang finished.</p><p>Releasing Min Zhuo might lure out the mastermind behind the events, but after some thought, Qin Sang decided not to reveal that Min Zhuo was still alive.</p><p>If the Daiyu Immortal Mountain was truly of such importance, it was best to keep its existence a secret.</p><p>Some texts in the Changyou tribe were only accessible to the chieftain.  Fearing leaks, Min Zhuo had never revealed them to anyone else.  Even those who had heard of the Daiyu Immortal Mountain from the Storm World cultivators would not have guessed the truth behind it.  Even Min Shu only knew Min Zhuo had infiltrated the polluted lands searching for the source of Qingling energy; he was unaware of the greater secret.</p><p>"Alas!"</p><p>After a long silence, Chieftain Yuan Xiang sighed and shook his head. "Zhenren, you've been caught in this.  Having lost this game, yet showing such strength, your opponent will not dare to act against you again. Rest assured."</p><p>Yuan Xiang stopped there.</p><p>Seeing that he knew something but wouldn't say it, Qin Sang didn’t press him, but he could guess. He nodded silently.</p><p>Chieftain Yuan Xiang's assessment was likely accurate, and with the Thunder Altar, Qin Sang feared no one unless a Nascent Soul cultivator appeared.</p><p>"Ah!  Almost forgot..."</p><p>Yuan Xiang reached into his sleeve and produced a round jade pendant which he gave to Qin Sang.</p><p>"During your battle with the Lu King, someone came from Ziyun Mountain. Seeing you were capable of handling the situation, they left this behind, instructing you to go to the place indicated by the pendant when you are free. You will be met there."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. He took the pendant and asked, "Was it Liuli?"</p><p>"No, it was not the Immortal Liuli."  Yuan Xiang shook his head. "I cannot reveal more.  A trip to Ziyun Mountain will answer your questions."</p><p>Black Myth finally released.  Sadly, I’m too busy now. I might need to take a day off in a few days (laughs).</p>
