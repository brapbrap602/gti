<h1>Chapter 709: Escape</h1><p>The commotion caused by the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman and the Sword Qi Thunderclap couldn't be concealed.</p><p>Fearing detection by the great demon, Qin Sang plunged into the ocean depths. Initially, he didn't dare use the talisman, only unleashing its power as he neared his destination.  The dragon roared, thunder rumbled.</p><p>His escape light, a streak of silver and crimson lightning, sliced through the air above the sea.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang moved, the great demon noticed him. It turned its massive body, blood-red eyes fixated on Qin Sang.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang saw the demon's true form. Its body was incredibly thick, and if not for the half that had been blasted away by the Cold Flame, it would have rivaled the Flood Dragon in size. It was clearly fish-like.</p><p>Its head was mangled, but Qin Sang could make out a human-like face, with features eerily similar to a human's.</p><p>"A Merman," Qin Sang thought.  Being stared at by the Merman's blood-red eyes sent a chill down his spine, yet he felt a slight relief.</p><p>The Merman's body was elongated, but it lacked the bloodline of a Flood Dragon. It was a sea beast.</p><p>The good news was that the Merman's cultivation wasn't as terrifying as he'd imagined. It wasn't at the peak of the Demon Core realm.</p><p>Mermen possessed astonishing water-based magic, especially potent in the vast ocean.  A peak Demon Core realm Merman would be a formidable opponent even for a Nascent Soul ancestor. Even against a wounded one, Qin Sang would have to tread carefully.</p><p>This Merman was clearly intelligent. Seeing Qin Sang pursuing it, its blood-red eyes blazed with murderous intent, yet it made a rational decision, immediately diving towards the seabed.</p><p>In the next moment, Qin Sang appeared above the sea, gazing down at the dark shadow below.  He flicked his hand, sending a black tongue of fire downwards. "Go!" he commanded.</p><p>‘Hiss…’</p><p>The Nine Yin Demonic Fire, unaffected by the seawater, moved swiftly towards the Merman.</p><p>Having recently suffered at the hands of the Cold Flame, the Merman's eyes filled with terror upon sensing the Nine Yin Demonic Fire. With a powerful flick of its body, it burst out of the water amidst a spray of foam.</p><p>Simultaneously, two shadowy figures, radiating a thick deathly aura, shot up from the waves on either side of the Merman with astonishing speed.</p><p>The next moment, the Merman’s body lunged forward, creating a huge wave as it slammed into one of the Skyfiends.</p><p>The Merman's judgment was precise, targeting the weaker of the two.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The impact sent the Skyfiend flying back into the water.  The Merman’s flesh was torn, leaving deep wounds tainted with deathly aura that seeped inwards.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. The beast could withstand attacks from two Skyfiends and even repel one.  Were its injuries not as severe as he’d thought?</p><p>He quickly extended his divine sense to check the Skyfiend's condition. Soul-Guiding Grass was rare in this area, making it difficult to refine new Skyfiends. Killing the Merman would be fine, but losing a Skyfiend in the process would be a painful loss.</p><p>Fortunately, the Skyfiend only suffered a disruption of its deathly aura, with no actual damage.</p><p>Having repelled one Skyfiend, the Merman let out a whale-like cry.  It opened its massive jaws, and a swirling white mist formed within, shooting outwards.</p><p>Crackling sounds emanated from the mist, which transformed into an icy fog.</p><p>The icy fog descended just as the Nine Yin Demonic Fire caught up, only to be blocked.</p><p>"Hiss..."  Qin Sang gasped.</p><p>This Merman had comprehended ice magic!</p><p>No wonder it appeared so battered yet not as weak as expected.  Its mastery of ice magic would have provided greater resistance to the Cold Flame.</p><p>Even with its magic, the Merman was still severely injured. Given enough time, Qin Sang was confident he could kill it.  However, a swift victory as he had envisioned was now impossible.</p><p>Hunting demons in the depths of the Demon Sea presented these dilemmas.  Whether to continue the pursuit was a judgment call.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered, a bird’s cry startled him. He looked up sharply.</p><p>The cry came from the distance, yet its penetrating power was extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the moment the cry echoed, the Merman turned its head in the same direction, its eyes filled with apprehension, seemingly wary of the cry's source.</p><p>"Another Demon Core realm demon?"  Qin Sang's heart sank.  He'd heard of the numerous great demons inhabiting the Thousand Demons Sea, and now he was witnessing it firsthand.  Another demon had been alerted and was approaching.</p><p>"No!"  Qin Sang quickly scanned his surroundings.</p><p>A red cloud was rapidly approaching from the direction of the bird's cry. In other directions, similar phenomena were unfolding.  A dark cloud in the west, rolling waves in the northeast revealing a long, white figure.</p><p>All these locations pulsed with demonic energy.</p><p>"The Cold Flame! They're drawn to the Cold Flame's eruption!"  Qin Sang exclaimed, finally realizing the source of the problem.</p><p>The Cold Flame's eruption, the blue beam piercing the sky, must have been witnessed by distant demons, drawing them towards it.  These were surely not all of them.  Demons from the surrounding waters were likely on their way.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang broke out in a cold sweat.  He didn't dare linger. Recalling his Skyfiends and Nine Yin Demonic Fire, he turned and fled.</p><p>The Merman watched Qin Sang retreat, hesitated, and then, with its bloodlust fading, sank back into the ocean depths instead of pursuing him.</p><p>East, northeast, west…</p><p>With great demons approaching from three directions, Qin Sang could only flee south, his path taking him past the Cold Flame.  He glanced at it briefly.</p><p>The island was now unrecognizable. The central hill had become a crater, as if blown open from the inside.  The cave was gone, leaving only a single blue Cold Flame flickering.</p><p>Up close, its ethereal beauty was captivating.</p><p>Sensing the Cold Flame's aura, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  Such a powerful flame, yet untouchable.</p><p>He had hoped the Cold Flame's location would remain hidden, allowing him to devise a plan to obtain it.  Now, with so many demons attracted to it, he wondered if any of them possessed the ability to subdue the flame.</p><p>Qin Sang was powerless in this situation, left to mere speculation.</p><p>His immediate priority was escape, avoiding being surrounded by the great demons.</p><p>He recalled the sea chart the stout cultivator had given them. South would lead back to the established sea route.</p><p>Trusting the chart, Qin Sang set his course, remaining vigilant, ready to evade any approaching demons.</p>
