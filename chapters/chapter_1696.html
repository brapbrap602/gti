<h1>Chapter 1687: Demon Tail</h1><p>Awakening the Gu King within one's body is undoubtedly a highly risky move.  Qin Sang guided the poisonous light towards the giant demonic soul, simultaneously activating the poison pearl to create a protective aura.  Even so, he couldn't prevent some residual poison from seeping into his body.  </p><p>Coupled with the Sun God Tree instantly draining his true essence, he almost suffered a toxic outburst. Qin Sang had anticipated the Sun God Tree's consumption; he swallowed a Boiling Snow Pill as he attacked. Immediately afterward, he experienced an extreme upswing followed by a sharp downturn. His true essence was depleted, leaving him weaker than he had ever felt since his breakthrough.</p><p>Then the Boiling Snow Pill dissolved within him, its medicinal power transforming into supremely pure vital energy. Unlike other pills, however, its effect was far from gentle; it was almost explosive.  The medicinal power surged like an avalanche, a bursting river, using Qin Sang's body as a flood plain.  Immense vital energy violently rushed through his limbs and meridians. Even with his late-Yuan Ying cultivation, the impact was beyond his limit.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang encountered such a ferocious pill.  The description of its effects in the formula was no exaggeration; intense pain shot through his meridians.  Several meridians tore, flesh exploded, and his whole body trembled.</p><p>Though the medicinal power replenished him, allowing him to quickly recover from his weakness, Qin Sang had no time to calmly regulate his vital energy. He could only forcefully stabilize a portion, suppressing the internal poison and pacifying the Gu King. Compared to the invading poisonous light, the Gu King was the greater danger. If the Gu King felt threatened and unleashed more poisonous light, Qin Sang would face severe consequences.</p><p>He held his breath, exerting all his strength to stabilize his energy sea, preventing the Gu King from being disturbed or sensing his weakness. The Gu King showed no trace of blood; this pure white, lustrous insect resembled a jade carving more than a terrifyingly venomous creature.</p><p>The Gu King's eyes moved, revealing a hint of confusion.  The sudden, sharp sword intent had startled it, prompting an instinctive counterattack.  But after regaining its senses, it found its surroundings unchanged, devoid of any immediate threat.  </p><p>It gently fluttered its wings. The Gu King sensed the Cloud Roaming Sword's intent, different from the murderous intent earlier. This intent was gentle, carrying only the wood element's aura – an aura it deeply feared. Since awakening its intelligence, the grotesque man had suppressed it with his supernatural power, leaving an imprint deep in its very being.</p><p>Surrounding it were seven-colored rays of light, another aura it detested.  Blinking its eyes, the Gu King encased itself in its wings, assuming a defensive posture, then fell silent.</p><p>“Whew…”</p><p>Once the Gu King fell asleep, Qin Sang let out a long sigh. Although this action was risky, the outcome was positive, and at that moment, there was no better choice.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang immediately mobilized the poison pearl's power to suppress the remaining poison.  During this process, his main body was constrained by the Gu King, limiting his movement. His subsequent attacks on Su Zinan were all carried out by his avatars. Qin Sang had judged that Su Zinan was engulfed in spiritual fire, escape impossible, rendering further risk unnecessary; he’d been secretly on guard all along.</p><p>The avatar shattered the Thousand Realms Mirror, successfully capturing Su Zinan's remnant soul.  However, an unexpected event occurred.</p><p>After the six divine birds exploded, their power exceeded expectations.  It wasn't simply about destroying the formation; it actually shook the spiritual array's foundation, ripping apart the Seven Mansions Sector Sword Array!</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Ban was laid by the entire Wu Xiang Immortal Sect. Each sword star within the array was painstakingly refined by top-tier sword cultivators from the Golden Aspect lineage, maintained by the Five Elements' cyclical generation and connected to the earth's veins—an enduring structure for countless years.  If the array were smaller, the outcome would have been far worse than a simple rupture.</p><p>Qin Sang anticipated that the sword array couldn't conceal the fluctuations of the South Bright Fiery Fire and would be detected by Nascent Soul cultivators.  If it hadn't been exposed, there might have been some room for maneuver. But he hadn't foreseen the array's shattering, leaving him completely exposed to everyone's sight.</p><p>On Emperor Bestowal Mountain, five-colored rays of light had engulfed half the peak.  Within the vast radiance, a hole abruptly appeared, spewing fire continuously. Those unfamiliar with the situation might mistake it for a conflict between the Five Elements Divine Bans, with the Fire Element Ban forcing its way in.</p><p>The South Bright Fiery Fire erupted within the sword array, most of the spiritual fire vented within. However, even the portion escaping after the array's destruction created a significant spectacle.</p><p>Deep within the fissure, amidst the raging inferno's edge, two figures flickered—Qin Sang's true form and his avatar.</p><p>The avatar had just captured Su Zinan's nascent soul.</p><p>Qin Sang's true form seemed stunned, looking upwards.  Those with sharp eyes could see his condition was far from normal: his face was ashen and weak, his body bloodied, his aura chaotic.  Clearly, he was gravely injured and his true essence was out of control.</p><p>"What's in his hand?"</p><p>South of Mount Di, above a palace resembling a temple, three figures hovered.  They were jointly breaking the palace's restrictions when the commotion on Mount Di caught their attention. Two looked towards Qin Sang's true form; the gaze of the third, a man in Taoist robes, was drawn to the avatar.</p><p>"It looks like a nascent soul..." one of them said hoarsely, as his companion shifted their gaze.</p><p>Those daring to linger near Mount Di were undoubtedly powerful, yet this one met such a tragic end, his nascent soul captured, unable to escape.</p><p>The avatar put away the nascent soul.  In that fleeting glimpse, they hadn't seen the soul's face clearly, only that it was smoking, as if scorched by fire.</p><p>The man in Taoist robes had seen Su Zinan before and seemed to recognize something, a sense of familiarity.</p><p>"That nascent soul is..." He opened his mouth, then fell silent, unable to utter the name; it seemed too unbelievable.</p><p>Jinxiang Hall.</p><p>An old nun intently watched the levitating lake, her expression tense.  First the purple lightning tribulation, then the Nascent Soul appearance. She had planned to lead her disciples out of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect immediately.  However, her junior sister sent a message: they had found a crucial secret chamber in Jinxiang Hall, but breaking the formation would take time.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator was entangled with the ancient demon, giving them time.  The old nun decided to take the risk, ordering her junior sister to break the formation quickly while she watched the battle above.  If the situation changed, she would have to withdraw decisively, abandoning the treasures.</p><p>The old nun also worried about Liuli's whereabouts.  With a Nascent Soul cultivator residing in the Legacy Mansion, powerful individuals abounded; the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect had become a place of turmoil.  They, the "remnants of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect," couldn't stay long.  She wondered where Liuli was and if she could retreat with them.</p><p>Clouds split, crimson fire shot into the sky.</p><p>The old nun was startled, her gaze briefly lingering on the mountain before turning to the western horizon.  She saw a familiar streak of light rapidly approaching, and her heart eased slightly.</p><p>It was Liuli.</p><p>Liuli flew on her sword, her expression serious as she watched the figures within the rift in the divine prohibition.</p><p>After bidding farewell to the old nun, she went in search of the Immortal Palace.  Following the nun's directions, she first went to the northern forbidden zone.  After going deep inside, she found it wasn't the Immortal Palace passage and retreated to the clifftop, where she saw a ruined teleportation array.</p><p>Liuli knew about the Immortal Palace's ascension, and this confirmed her suspicions. Top-tier experts repeatedly appeared on Mount Di, proving that something had also happened to the Central Plains Immortal Palace.</p><p>She put aside the matter of the Immortal Palace and focused on herself. Remembering something unusual she’d seen in the northern forbidden zone—a potential opportunity—she turned back.</p><p>As she was about to enter the zone, the ancient demon broke free, and the Nascent Soul cultivator emerged.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Liuli saw a familiar figure from afar—Qin Sang's avatar, left behind by the Hui Guang Saint.  She realized Qin Sang was also here.</p><p>She didn't know if the avatar was acting alone or if Qin Sang's true form was also trapped on Mount Di.  Being targeted by a Nascent Soul cultivator meant an uncertain outcome; even if it was just the avatar, its loss would be devastating. Though her mark had led her to become a nun and to deliberately distance herself from Qin Sang, she knew she couldn't blame him.</p><p>She and Qin Sang had shared life and death, travelling through storms for decades.  She couldn't stand by and watch him die. Liuli immediately decided to forgo entering the forbidden zone and return, to see if she could help.</p><p>As expected, before she arrived, Qin Sang's true form appeared, creating quite a stir.</p><p>"It's the Sun God Bird…" Liuli recognized the crimson fire.</p><p>Its power surpassed that of three birds combined. Qin Sang must have broken through, and not recently, otherwise he wouldn't be able to summon so many Sun God Birds.</p><p>Hiding for so long, only to reveal himself now!</p><p>Liuli's eyebrows furrowed slightly, and she increased her speed.</p><p>The levitating lake was stained with ink.</p><p>The demonic body unleashed its ferocity.</p><p>Five-colored spiritual light flew chaotically, demonic claws flashing—sometimes small as a human hand, sometimes large enough to hold the heavens—their power consistent, touching them meant injury or death.</p><p>Several great cultivators struggled to cope, their anger suppressed.</p><p>Since breaking through to the late Yuan Ying stage, when have they ever been so disheveled?</p><p>However, although the demonic body's power is terrifying, because the demonic spirit is in a frenzy and attacks without any pattern, only resorting to brute force, dodging is incredibly difficult.  But as time went on, they became more familiar with the demonic body's methods and gradually gained some experience.</p><p>Amid the chaos, everyone nervously watched the progress of the sealing pillar's repair.</p><p>Surrounded by the Heart Fire of the Hui Guang Saint, the sealing pillar was like being thrown into a furnace.  The Heart Fire flowed across its surface, as if melting the pillar.</p><p>In fact, this was an illusion; the sealing pillar itself remained unharmed.</p><p>The internal restrictions were activated by the Heart Fire, emitting a faint black light, most intense at the broken points. This showed that the Hui Guang Saint had a plan and had begun to manipulate the restrictions.</p><p>The broken parts of the sealing pillar were extremely smooth, fitting together seamlessly.</p><p>Now, a noticeable gap appeared between the two sections.  The intangible Heart Fire spread through the crack, some even penetrating deep into the pillar's interior.</p><p>At this time, the lotus platform beneath the Hui Guang Saint changed shape, with countless runes appearing on the petals.  If Qin Sang were to see them, he would find them familiar.</p><p>They resembled the formations he and his senior sister Bai had devised years ago to cooperate with the Demon Binding Rope – the Suppressing Demon Formation, as the Hui Guang Saint had called it.</p><p>The Hui Guang Saint had no formation diagram and could only divert his attention to temporarily inscribe it on the lotus platform. This action held deeper meaning.  As soon as the Suppressing Demon Formation was complete, the sealing pillar’s glow suddenly intensified, echoing the formation.</p><p>The Suppressing Demon Formation, acting as a guide, also helped in understanding the sealing pillar's restrictions.  The Hui Guang Saint's furrowed brow gradually smoothed out.  His fingers moved like wheels, constantly casting various profound Buddhist seals.</p><p>The seals transformed into streams of golden light that entered the sealing pillar.</p><p>Initially, there were no obvious changes. As time passed, faint golden light emerged from within the crack, and the sealing pillar's momentum shifted.</p><p>"At this rate, if we can hold on until the Hui Guang Saint repairs the sealing pillar, we should be able to manage."</p><p>This was the thought of Fan Lao Mo and the others.  Seeing the Hui Guang Saint's progress was quite smooth, they all felt relieved.</p><p>Qinghu Shengwang's grasp of the situation was more precise, and she was more optimistic than they were.</p><p>The Sky Lake had almost turned black, looking like a demon-tainted lake. Even the phoenix hairpin that had transformed into a celestial pillar was shrouded in demonic energy, obscuring its original form.</p><p>This was all deliberate on Qinghu Shengwang's part. As the saying goes, it's better to let out than to block. After stabilizing their position, she attempted to deliberately expose weaknesses, laying bait to create opportunities for the demonic body.</p><p>Although it seemed extremely dangerous, it was much easier to deal with than at the beginning.</p><p>Everyone present were seasoned top-tier experts, perfectly executing Qinghu Shengwang's will. Of course, they could do this because of the sealing pillar; they had the confidence to engage with the demonic body without worrying about consumption.</p><p>The bright moon remained pure. The bright moon was the cornerstone of the Sky Lake. Qinghu Shengwang, her robes fluttering, stood high in the air, very close to the moon, like a fairy among the stars.</p><p>She controlled the overall situation, watching the demonic body's every move, until a change occurred in the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up. Even across the Sky Lake, he could see those enchanting eyes, suddenly feeling a sharp pain in his eyes, as if his heart was pierced, his heart beating violently.</p><p>Qinghu Shengwang saw the mass of red fire tearing through the clouds, raised an eyebrow, and narrowed her eyes, a cold light flashing.</p><p>Then, Qinghu Shengwang glanced at the Hui Guang Saint.</p><p>The Hui Guang Saint was seen sitting in meditation on the lotus platform, focused and wholeheartedly urging the Heart Fire, seemingly oblivious to the changes below.</p><p>The Nan Ming Li Fire was, after all, a rootless fire.</p><p>After tearing through the Seven Mansions Star Field Sword Array, the red fire faltered and soon stopped gushing out. While the giant stone-like fireball was still dancing in the void, the five-colored clouds had already begun to counterattack.</p><p>Especially the earth and water divine prohibitions on either side of the sword array, taking advantage of the confusion, pressed towards the center.  There were continuous rumbling sounds from the mountain, and under the intense impact, the mountaintop began to tilt, the mountain about to be broken.</p><p>The gap in the clouds was about to close.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body seemed to sense something, a look of unease flashing in his eyes.  He forcibly suppressed the turbulent energy in his body, his figure trembled, and he and his avatar plunged towards the depths of the cloud rift.</p><p>Qinghu Shengwang's eyes flickered, and a cold smile appeared on her lips.</p><p>Her three fox tails suddenly fell off, transforming into three streams of light that shot downwards.  Instead of heading towards the demonic body, they passed through the Sky Lake and fell directly towards the cloud rift.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>A cold shout, audible to all, made everyone's faces change.</p><p>"So it's you! You killed my disciple, seriously injured my beloved general, and dare to appear before me!"</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Streams of light plummeted.</p><p>The clouds on both sides of the gap suddenly paused for a moment.</p><p>At that instant, an astonishing pressure descended from the sky.  The three streams of light reappeared in their original fox tail form, but with a flicker, they transformed into three figures, each charming and seductive, identical in appearance, attire, and bearing to Qinghu Shengwang.</p><p>The figures seemed somewhat illusory, as if they were some kind of divine ability similar to a dharma body, but the pressure they brought was no different from a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Their expressions were calm, their postures elegant, as they stepped into the cloud rift.</p>
