<h1>Chapter 551: An Unrecognized Reunion</h1><p>Master Che Yu Tao's residence was unostentatious, with a simple courtyard featuring a few flowers and plants.  Most of the disciples of Shao Hua Mountain at the Foundation Establishment stage or higher who were stationed at Xuanlu Pass were present, with only a few exceptions.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed several unfamiliar faces, likely disciples who had recently arrived from the sect.</p><p>These individuals stood quietly and orderly in the courtyard, maintaining complete silence.</p><p>Standing beside Master Che was a powerfully built man with a ruddy complexion and a calm demeanor.  He unusually carried an exceptionally heavy Xuan iron broadsword, wrapped in cloth, resembling a worldly swordsman.</p><p>Qin Sang had never seen this man before, but the Xuan iron broadsword on his back instantly revealed his identity: Ji Qing, Master Che’s eldest disciple.</p><p>While Zhan Yi was undoubtedly a favorite of Master Che, Ji Qing, this powerfully built man, was the most renowned of Master Che’s direct disciples, once considered the top expert of Shao Hua Mountain.  Unlike Qin Sang, Ji Qing earned this title through numerous victories in the Grand Tournament of the Eight Righteous Sects.</p><p>At the time of the tournament, Qin Sang was still cultivating in seclusion in Qingyang Market Town, having only recently broken through to the late Foundation Establishment stage. Even if he had participated, without using his corpse refining techniques or magical treasures, he would have struggled to achieve a high ranking.</p><p>However, Qiu Mu Bai did not participate in that tournament; therefore, Ji Qing never fought him, leaving the question of who was stronger unanswered.</p><p>After the tournament, Ji Qing disappeared after receiving his reward and remained absent during the subsequent turmoil in the Xiao Han region. He was either traveling or secluded in preparation for the Golden Core stage.</p><p>It seems his attempt at forming a Golden Core failed, and he is currently still at the Nascent Golden Core stage.</p><p>A woman in a hooded cloak sat on the main seat, her face obscured.  Her presence alongside Master Che indicated her high status. Could she be a reclusive Golden Core cultivator from the sect?</p><p>I don't recall any senior aunt who favored wearing a cloak, Qin Sang mused, giving the cloaked woman another look. He was suddenly startled; despite being completely concealed, she evoked a strange sense of familiarity.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a growing sense of unease.</p><p>“Mu Bai, come here!”</p><p>Upon seeing several people enter, Master Che smiled warmly, gesturing for Qiu Mu Bai to approach, then noticed Qin Sang.</p><p>“Eh? Qin Sang is also at Xuanlu Pass? Come forward as well.”</p><p>Qin Sang exchanged a look with Qiu Mu Bai.  Seeing Qiu Mu Bai's equally puzzled expression, Qin Sang felt slightly reassured. Although unsure why Master Che summoned them, the involvement of Qiu Mu Bai and Ji Qing suggested it wasn't a negative development.</p><p>“Greetings, Master Che.”</p><p>Both approached and paid their respects.</p><p>Master Che gestured for them to relax, then asked Qin Sang, “If I remember correctly, your main cultivation path is water-elemental spiritual power?”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately replied, “Yes.”</p><p>Master Che nodded and turned to the cloaked woman.</p><p>“Miss Chen Yan, Qiu Mu Bai’s strength is unquestionable; his appointment to oversee the White Tiger beast seal will ensure success. This is also Master's intention, to send Mu Bai on this tempering experience.</p><p>“This is Qin Sang, my nephew. Miss Chen Yan has been in secluded cultivation, so she probably hasn't met him.</p><p>“He is known as the Shadowless Sword, displaying exceptional skill during the conflicts with the Tianxing Alliance.  Among his peers, he ranks among the strongest.  Aside from Mu Bai and Ji Qing, no one here is a match for him; he'll oversee the Xuanwu beast seal.</p><p>“With Ji Qing overseeing the Gouchen beast seal, we only need two more individuals.”</p><p>The moment Master Che uttered ‘Miss Chen Yan,’ Qin Sang froze.</p><p>It was her!</p><p>The only woman he had ever been intimate with, a connection born of a difficult-to-explain circumstance—a connection Qin Sang could never forget.</p><p>She was also the reason for the damage to his foundation that prevented him from advancing to the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang harbored no resentment.  The sacrifice of his foundation for the sake of reaching the Foundation Establishment stage was his own choice. He had no right to blame anyone.</p><p>Such are the ways of the world; when one takes a shortcut to overcome difficulties, one may later have to pay a hundredfold, or even a thousandfold, the price.</p><p>Without that event as a furnace and cauldron, he might never have had the chance to reach the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stages are not the same.</p><p>Nascent Golden Core cultivators are considered experts in the cultivation world; they can seek opportunities and protect themselves adequately, and also take risks.  Cultivators at the Qi Refinement stage face greater uncertainty; their lives are fragile.</p><p>It had been a fair exchange back then; after that night, they were no longer connected.</p><p>Both strictly adhered to their agreement, tacitly forgetting the incident.</p><p>No matter what difficulties Qin Sang encountered, he never considered seeking her help.  In fact, after that incident, he had never mentioned the name ‘Chen Yan’ to anyone.</p><p>Chen Yan had likewise never offered him assistance or caused him hardship, effectively treating him as non-existent.</p><p>That event happened almost a century ago. Now, Qin Sang finally saw Chen Yan again.</p><p>Over the years, Chen Yan had vanished without a trace, causing newer disciples to be unaware of her existence.</p><p>Some time ago, Qin Sang suddenly thought of Chen Yan, wondering if she had successfully achieved Nascent Soul stage.  Unexpectedly, she saw her under these circumstances!</p><p>Judging by Che Yutao's tone, even he was kept in the dark about his entanglement with Chen Yan.  No wonder so much effort was made back then, using Master Ma Wu's name to deceive everyone.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart churned, but her expression remained unchanged. She seemingly calmly glanced at Chen Yan.</p><p>Chen Yan was sitting quietly, listening to Che Yutao, seemingly ignoring both Qin Sang and Qiu Mubai.</p><p>"Let's follow the old rules,"</p><p>Qin Sang silently thought.</p><p>"Let's treat each other as strangers, and forget about our past."</p><p>But she couldn't help but wonder: Why did Chen Yan secretly leave seclusion and come to Xuanlu Pass? Had she achieved Nascent Soul stage? What did she want from them?</p><p>When Che Yutao mentioned the White Tiger Seal, the Xuanwu Seal, and the Gouchen Seal, Qin Sang was completely baffled.</p><p>She had never heard of them before. She didn't know what these seals were or why they were being controlled by others.</p><p>Qin Sang looked sideways at Qiu Mubai, seeking an explanation through her eyes.</p><p>Qiu Mubai gently shook his head.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently waited for Che Yutao's explanation, without looking at Chen Yan again.</p><p>Che Yutao finished speaking.</p><p>A calm voice came from under the cloak: "Fine."</p><p>Just like old times.</p><p>The familiar voice stirred Qin Sang's memories, but she quickly suppressed them.</p><p>Old friends meet, yet don't recognize each other...</p><p>...</p><p>Che Yutao obeyed Chen Yan implicitly, turning to the courtyard.</p><p>Besides Qin Sang, Qiu Mubai, and Ji Qing, everyone else was standing neatly in the courtyard, including Zhan Yi and Mu Yifeng, and other Foundation Establishment masters.</p><p>Che Yutao addressed the people in the courtyard, "Spread out, everyone. Show your best skills, and let Miss Chen Yan assess you. Remember, don't hold back.  Maintain your stance with all your strength until you can't hold it any longer."</p><p>Hearing this, the people in the courtyard exchanged glances.</p><p>Although they didn't know the reason for this assessment, seeing that Qiu Mubai and the others were prominent figures in the sect, the opportunity to be ranked alongside them was certainly not something to be missed.</p><p>Immediately, everyone followed Che Yutao's orders, spreading out and taking up a small space each.</p>
