<h1>Chapter 1157: The Banner of the Beast King</h1><p>The eighth layer of the "Primordial Spirit Nurturing Sword Scripture."</p><p>Upon reaching this realm, one could comprehend the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation.</p><p>Only by re-experiencing the techniques and secrets of the cultivation method at the Nascent Soul stage could one truly grasp its profound mysteries.</p><p>Qin Sang entered a meditative state, focusing on the cultivation method. His gaze first fell on the combat technique—the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation.</p><p>Having already comprehended the sword's momentum, he had laid a solid foundation. Without much effort, he grasped the true essence of the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation and successfully executed it.</p><p>However, this slaughter formation felt like an empty shell, more akin to the sword formation Qin Sang had previously comprehended on his own.</p><p>The Seven Souls Slaughter Formation was extremely profound. The degree of fusion between the sword soul, the killing talisman, and the seven souls would determine the formation's power.</p><p>For now, it seemed that fully unleashing the formation's potential would take some time. Temporarily, it could only serve as a basic combat technique, with his greatest trump card still being the Demon Banner.</p><p>Setting aside the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation for the moment, Qin Sang began to practice the cultivation method.</p><p>He had long memorized the scripture, but his previous level of cultivation had made it seem obscure and difficult to understand.</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, he was finally able to begin comprehending it.</p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang opened his eyes, deep in thought.</p><p>"Projecting the killing talisman onto the sword soul..."</p><p>He frowned, feeling somewhat lost. After some consideration, he summoned the Ebony Sword and one of its sword souls, connecting his mind to the first killing talisman.</p><p>He imagined the killing talisman as a tangible entity, merging himself with it, drawing upon its power to condense a shadow of the talisman and integrate it into the sword soul.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The sword soul suddenly shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang was jolted awake, realizing that the sword soul was not a physical entity. Like other sword lights, it was illusory, merely carrying the aura of his spirit.</p><p>How could such a sword light bear the power of the killing talisman and remain eternal?</p><p>Unexpectedly, the first step of the cultivation method turned out to be the most difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang steadied his mind, undeterred, and re-condensed the sword soul. While delving deeper into the scripture, he continued to experiment.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang sensed that the protective formation of his cave had been disturbed by an outsider. With a sweep of his divine sense, he recognized Elder Xun, whom he had met before.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang rose and stepped out of the cave.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin!"</p><p>Elder Xun greeted Qin Sang with great courtesy.</p><p>This was not solely due to Qing Jun's influence.</p><p>Although Qin Sang did not wish to reveal his Nascent Soul identity, he also did not intend to remain overly discreet. His displayed cultivation level was unmistakably at the peak of the Golden Core stage.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xun, please come in!"</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands in greeting and invited Elder Xun inside, speaking amiably, "Last time, when I followed the Sect Master back to the mountain, it was too rushed, and I didn't have the chance to visit fellow Daoists. Please forgive me, Elder Xun."</p><p>"Not at all, not at all."</p><p>Elder Xun waved his hands repeatedly, not mentioning Qin Sang's origins at all.</p><p>"I only learned of Fellow Daoist Qin's return through my disciples. Before the Sect Master left, he entrusted me with the affairs of the sect. If Fellow Daoist Qin has any needs, please let me know, and I will have the disciples prepare in advance."</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude, "No need to trouble Fellow Daoist Xun. During my travels, I gained some insights. This time, I returned to seclude myself for a while and perhaps browse through the ancient texts in the sect's collection..."</p><p>Speaking of which, Qin Sang still couldn't fathom how Qing Jun, his senior sister, would arrange matters for the Yuan Shen Sect in the future.</p><p>The Yuan Shen Sect had been built up over several generations, with a deep foundation.</p><p>If the Qingyang Temple could annex the Yuan Shen Sect, it would effortlessly establish itself as a top-tier sect.</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but he quickly suppressed it. There was no need to rush the establishment of the Qingyang Temple. He could inquire about Qing Jun's thoughts when the opportunity arose.</p><p>After some pleasantries, Elder Xun led Qin Sang to the place where the sect's treasured texts were kept. Along the way, they chatted amiably, and Qin Sang learned some news about the frontlines from Elder Xun.</p><p>After seeing Elder Xun off, Qin Sang eagerly delved into the ancient texts, including the Yuan Shen Sect's most precious spiritual formation scriptures, gaining substantial insights.</p><p>From then on, he remained in the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>Qin Sang finally succeeded in projecting the shadow of the first killing talisman onto a sword soul.</p><p>Within the sword soul, the shadow of the killing talisman flickered faintly. Although somewhat blurry, it did not collapse as before.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath. This had consumed a great deal of his mental energy, but he had finally succeeded.</p><p>There was no need to rush now. He only needed to continue refining the sword soul, systematically projecting all seven killing talismans, and then attempt to fuse the seven souls.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew the sword soul and turned his attention to other matters.</p><p>First, he took out the Nine-Life Mystic Turtle shell.</p><p>The best use for this shell would be to refine it into a defensive treasure.</p><p>But Qin Sang had other plans.</p><p>At the same time, he also took out the green copper fragment.</p><p>He had a reason for placing these two treasures together. The profound water energy contained within the turtle shell could counteract fire, and perhaps it could be used in conjunction with the green copper fragment to subdue the South Ming Li Fire.</p><p>For now, this was only Qin Sang's initial idea, and these two treasures alone might not be enough.</p><p>However, before proceeding, he certainly couldn't casually refine the turtle shell.</p><p>After some contemplation, Qin Sang's fingers danced, casting simple restrictions that landed on the surface of the turtle shell. The shell was tough enough to serve as a shield.</p><p>Having dealt with the turtle shell, Qin Sang then took out the Star Conch.</p><p>After testing the Star Conch's power, Qin Sang shook his head. This treasure had a limit to the amount of true essence it could absorb, and in combat, it could only be used once. It was no longer very useful at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The same applied to the Mixed Origin Unity Ring and the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman.</p><p>These treasures, which had served him well during the Golden Core stage, were now outdated.</p><p>On the other hand, the Thunder Summoning Technique, having grown in power with his breakthrough in cultivation, remained a formidable Daoist art.</p><p>"And these!"</p><p>Qin Sang also pulled out some spirit banners.</p><p>These were the Beast King Banners he had obtained from killing the disciples of the Black Snake Mountain of the Witch Clan.</p><p>At its peak, the Beast King Banner formation consisted of eighty-one banners. If fully assembled and controlled by Golden Core disciples, it would be a powerful formation that could be left to the Qingyang Temple as a true inheritance.</p><p>Even if the Qingyang Temple lacked a Nascent Soul cultivator in the future, it would not decline too quickly.</p><p>Although the number of Beast King Banners was insufficient, Qin Sang had obtained the method to refine them. While the Cold Domain lacked enough demon beasts to harvest souls for the banners, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was teeming with cloud beasts.</p><p>During this time, he had browsed the Yuan Shen Sect's collection and gained some insights into spiritual formations. When he had the time, he would attempt to modify the Beast King Banners.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang organized the contents of his Thousand Jun Ring, systematically reviewing all the treasures he possessed.</p><p>The last item was the Demon Banner.</p><p>There were a total of eighteen Demon Banners.</p><p>After breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang no longer needed elixirs to control twelve Demon Banners in combat.</p><p>He had tested it—twelve was the limit; he could not control more.</p><p>Back in the day, the Ancestor of the Ghost Yin Sect had only ten banners and had made a great name for himself.</p><p>With twelve Demon Banners forming a formation, their power rivaled that of a top-grade treasure. Qin Sang estimated that, combined with his other abilities, he could hold his own against a mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>At the very least, he could rely on his escape techniques to flee.</p><p>However, every Nascent Soul old monster was formidable, and Qin Sang would not provoke them unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>"Cultivation cannot be rushed. It would be better to focus my efforts on the 'Seed of Fire, Golden Lotus.' If I can make progress, I might be able to control fifteen Demon Banners..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>I went out to relax over the weekend and returned late, so I only managed to write one chapter. I'll make up for it later.</p>
