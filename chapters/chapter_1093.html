<h1>Chapter 185: Soul Slave</h1><p>The Ancient Demon's soul fragment was not to be underestimated.</p><p>After the Southern Wanderer moved the Demon Subduing Stele, the Demon Lord was immediately in mortal danger.</p><p>Even with the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise's timely aid, the Demon Lord was still suppressed by the Ancient Demon's soul fragment.</p><p>The other battle was even more perilous.</p><p>The four great cultivators besieging Mo Qingzhu fared only slightly better than before, managing only to avoid being defeated individually. Mo Qingzhu's demonic might surged, overwhelming them and forcing them to retreat steadily. Defeat seemed imminent.</p><p>Just at this critical moment, a scene that delighted everyone unfolded.</p><p>Qingzhu's will remained firm. Even facing such a terrifying opponent, he hadn't given up hope.</p><p>He hid within the fragments of the Spirit Sword, and the demonic soul was momentarily unable to harm him.</p><p>This physical body originally belonged to Qingzhu.</p><p>Even with the vast disparity in power, Qingzhu's desperate resistance could still influence the demonic soul's actions.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu's aura fluctuated. Though subtle, almost imperceptible, in this precarious situation, it was enough of a weakness for Spirit Pearl and the others to exploit.</p><p>The situation improved slightly.</p><p>The old man, his expression grave, knew the urgency of the situation and raced against time to refine the Heavenly Phoenix Plume.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang clutched the lotus seed in one hand and the ghost seal Su Nü had given him in the other, shrinking back.</p><p>Before the battle, the old man had erected a barrier to protect the young man and woman from the residual energy. Qin Sang, having moved closer, also benefited from its protection.</p><p>However, with the intensity of the battle, whether the barrier could withstand the onslaught remained uncertain.</p><p>The young man and woman, their faces etched with worry for their masters, noticed Qin Sang's actions and glanced at him, too preoccupied to pay him much attention.</p><p>They were curious about how this person had appeared here, but this clearly wasn't the time to delve into such matters.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed himself against the edge of the space, opening his left hand to reveal the ghost seal.</p><p>Seeing that the body occupied by the Ancient Demon's soul fragment was indeed Su Nü's, Qin Sang remembered the ghost seal she had entrusted to him.</p><p>Su Nü had suspected the Eastern Polar Alliance harbored ill intentions towards her, fearing they would use her as a vessel for possession.  She had given the ghost seal to Qin Sang as a precaution. But she surely couldn't have imagined that the entity plotting to seize her body was such a terrifying Ancient Demon.</p><p>Could a mere ghost seal possibly be of any use?</p><p>With the mindset of trying anything, Qin Sang activated the ghost seal according to the method Su Nü had taught him.</p><p>However, the situation changed too rapidly.</p><p>Before the secret technique could be completed, the Heavenly Phoenix Plume changed hands, and the great battle erupted.</p><p>Both battlefields were on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang's lips moved slightly. As the secret technique neared completion, an astonishing scene unfolded. A wisp of black energy emerged from the ghost seal, transforming into a human form bearing a striking resemblance to Su Nü!</p><p>‘Su Nü’s’ face was contorted in agony, emitting a silent wail.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Astonishment filled Qin Sang. Before he could examine it closely, he felt a sudden tightening sensation, as if a gaze had locked onto him.  He looked up in alarm to find the Demon Lord staring at him.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang activated the ghost seal, faint ghost markings appeared on the Ancient Demon's soul fragment's face, emanating an unusual波动distinct from the Ancient Demon's own.</p><p>Compared to the Ancient Demon’s aura, the fluctuation from the ghost markings was incredibly weak, practically negligible.</p><p>But upon seeing the ghost markings, the Demon Lord's eyes lit up, instantly locking onto the source—the ghost seal in Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>“Give it to me!”</p><p>The Demon Lord's roar echoed in Qin Sang's ears. His body stiffened, and then he felt the ghost seal snatched from his grasp.</p><p>“Hmm? A soul seed or a slave seal? Interesting!”</p><p>The Demon Lord chuckled, as if he had stumbled upon some treasure.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A brilliant yellow light erupted from the Demon Lord's palm, channeling a torrent of Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light into the ghost seal.</p><p>At this moment, the Ancient Demon's soul fragment glanced down at its arm, intending to shatter the ghost markings.</p><p>As the Demon Lord acted, the seemingly fragile ghost markings suddenly surged with ghostly energy, resisting the Ancient Demon's power.  They instantly spread across half of the face, rapidly extending towards the body.</p><p>It was the face that had once belonged to Su Nü.</p><p>Half covered in eerie, sinister ghost markings.</p><p>Half consumed by rampant, bloodthirsty demonic flames.</p><p>“If it’s truly a soul seed or a slave seal as the Demon Lord says, could it be that Su Nü, to resist the soul possessing her body, willingly transformed herself into a soul slave? Then, she could combine her own power with her master's to devour the other soul?”</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely guessed Su Nü’s plan, stunned by this woman’s audacity.</p><p>To face possession by transforming oneself into a soul slave, willingly handing over the ghost seal and choosing a master – such a notion was utterly insane.</p><p>Qin Sang was the master she had chosen.</p><p>Even if successful, she would still become another’s slave.</p><p>Of course, the difference between this and being possessed was that she would still be alive.</p><p>In the cultivation world, as long as one lived, there was hope!</p><p>If the opponent wasn't a terrifying Ancient Demon but a mere remnant soul, Su Nü’s plan might have succeeded.</p><p>“I wonder if the Ancient Demon hasn't completely devoured Su Nü yet? Or perhaps Su Nü’s soul is hidden within the ghost markings. After breaking free, the Ancient Demon’s soul fragment has been through several battles and hasn’t had time to examine the body? Who could have predicted that someone so weak the Ancient Demon could completely ignore could actually outsmart it…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, feeling incredibly fortunate. He hadn't expected Su Nü’s arrangement to play such a crucial role at this juncture.  "If I make it out alive this time," he thought, "I really need to thank her properly."</p><p>He just didn't know if Su Nü was still alive.</p><p>This bizarre scene not only shocked Qin Sang but also caught the Ancient Demon's soul fragment completely off guard, filling it with rage and astonishment.</p><p>The Demon Lord, having cultivated the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light, was highly proficient in the ways of ghosts. With the ghost seal in his control, it wouldn’t be easy for the Ancient Demon’s soul fragment to shatter the ghost markings.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the ghost seal enveloped in Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light.  Its form had drastically changed, now surrounded by countless wraiths, completely different from before.</p><p>The fluctuations within the ghost markings grew stronger.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's soul fragment, despite its all-out suppression, could only confine the ghost markings to the cheek. Even reduced to a mere black dot, they wouldn’t be completely erased.</p><p>Unexpected turns had occurred on both battlefields. Both individuals were victims of possession, yet they were using their own methods to fight back.</p><p>With the ghost markings under his control, the Demon Lord naturally wouldn't let this hard-won opportunity slip. He used the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light to analyze and refine the ghost seal.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's soul fragment, enraged, glared at the ghost seal in the Demon Lord's hand and charged towards him furiously.</p><p>The Demon Lord and the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise exchanged a glance.  Using the tortoise shell as a shield, they desperately protected the ghost seal, engaging the Ancient Demon's soul fragment in a fierce struggle.</p><p>The previously precarious situation was, for the moment, stabilized.</p><p>However, this stalemate couldn’t last.</p><p>Finally, the old man completed the secret technique to refine the Heavenly Phoenix Plume.</p><p>After a quick glance at the two battlefields, he unhesitantly swept the plume across the crimson crystalline wall.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Plume ignited spontaneously.</p><p>However, this time the flames were weak, far less intense than when the Flood Dragon King had wielded it using the Phoenix Clan's secret technique.</p><p>Fortunately, it was enough!</p><p>Burned by the phoenix flames, the crystalline wall appeared to melt.</p><p>The ethereal Heavenly Phoenix Plume tore a fissure in the crimson barrier, and, enveloped in phoenix flames, the old man stepped through!</p>
