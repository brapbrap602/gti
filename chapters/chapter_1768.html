<h1>Chapter 1759: Xuanji Gate</h1><p>The term "zhengfa" refers to the Daoist methods taught by the two courts of the Daoist Tribunal, also known as official methods.</p><p>In contrast, the methods taught by various schools and sects outside the Daoist Tribunal are called "sifa" .</p><p>Whether zhengfa or sifa, their essence lies in possessing corresponding cultivation methods, receiving heavenly blessings, invoking protective deities corresponding to the methods, and progressing step by step in cultivation.</p><p>However, according to Qin Sang's understanding, there is another type of Daoist method, either lacking cultivation methods or unable to sense the corresponding deity.</p><p>Those lacking cultivation methods can practice other methods, but because the methods do not match the Daoist method, most of the benefits are unattainable, making cultivation and breakthroughs more difficult than others.</p><p>Those unable to sense the corresponding deity can only forcibly focus on other deities, but due to incompatibility, there is a risk of instability.</p><p>These are called "waifa" .</p><p>Upon learning this, Qin Sang immediately had an idea; obtaining waifa is obviously easier.</p><p>His own cultivation method is strong enough; he doesn't want to change methods unless absolutely necessary, nor does he care how much benefit a Daoist method brings him.</p><p>With the Jade Buddha protecting his primordial spirit, a protective deity is dispensable.</p><p>In other words, the various disadvantages of waifa are not a problem for him, as long as the power to stabilize his energy remains!</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more he felt that waifa was perfect for him.</p><p>However, a damaged Daoist method means that the sect has lost its lineage.  Receiving such a method requires going through the sect's ancestral hall, but with the lineage gone, where is the ancestral hall to be found, and who can grant him the method?</p><p>The Daoist Tribunal might possess this information, but the problem returns to the original point: how does he gain the Daoist Tribunal's trust and obtain these secrets?</p><p>Regardless, Qin Sang has at least found viable paths, more than one.</p><p>As far as he knows, the Daoist Tribunal also has the concept of "jiafa" .</p><p>Daoist cultivators who gain the Daoist Tribunal's recognition and join as officials, if they wish to leave their original sect, can even be granted zhengfa, truly joining the Daoist Tribunal's cultivation system.</p><p>It sounds like gaining official rank in the secular world.</p><p>But joining the Daoist Tribunal requires extremely strict scrutiny. Obtaining a flawless identity is almost impossible.</p><p>Once within the Daoist Tribunal, one's actions are constrained.</p><p>Many secular affairs would burden one, affecting cultivation, which Qin Sang does not desire.</p><p>He is reluctant to expend much effort on his own Qingyang Temple, preferring to establish the framework and then act as a hands-off manager.</p><p>Combined with various concerns, he will not compromise unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>As his thoughts turned, Qin Sang's face showed a thoughtful expression.</p><p>After a moment, he shook his head and said, "I don't need a fellow cultivator who practices star-killing charms, but rather someone skilled in incantations and shaping."</p><p>Upon seeing the reward of the Daoist Tribunal's summons, he had a sudden idea: since he couldn't find a place where starlight converged, why not try another approach?</p><p>In this world, countless Daoist experts excel in charms, and many are related to the constellations.</p><p>If he could invite a powerful cultivator to use charms to draw starlight and perform a star essence infusion for him, it should be feasible.</p><p>This would require an extremely high level of skill from the caster; their cultivation must be at least at the Transformation Stage.</p><p>Inviting such an expert wouldn't be easy.</p><p>During the star essence infusion, Qin Sang would need to focus on his breakthrough and guard against the other party's betrayal or ill intentions.</p><p>The Daoist Tribunal's summons gave Qin Sang hope.</p><p>He took the summons, intending to use merit to obtain the expert's help, essentially making a pact with the Daoist Tribunal, related to its reputation.</p><p>The person who lends their assistance should not dare to defy righteousness and risk incurring the wrath of the world by harming him.</p><p>His worries were thus resolved.</p><p>However, he needs to carefully consider what charms to use during the star essence infusion.</p><p>Star-killing charms, as the name suggests, are purely offensive charms.  Qin Sang seeks a breakthrough, not death, so they're clearly unsuitable.</p><p>This world's Daoist charm system is comprehensive and covers everything. Since many charms have multiple functions, no one makes a strict classification; only a few conventionally accepted methods exist.</p><p>The terms "incantation" and "shaping" refer to two types.</p><p>Incantation charms can dispel filth and toxins, resolving various unfavorable states, many with healing effects.</p><p>Shaping charms are strengthening charms; those in the military hall mainly use them for their troops, while those in the dragon and tiger hall use them for themselves, excelling in this area. When Shen Huo broke down the temple, his body swelled to several meters, using this type of charm.</p><p>It can be seen that incantation and shaping charms are mostly beneficial and harmless, and that's what Qin Sang needs.</p><p>The old Daoist understood Qin Sang's request. After pondering for a moment, he stroked his long beard and said, "I understand, fellow Daoist. There are countless charms in the world, but if one speaks of such incantations, none surpass the Xuanji Gate, especially their Northern Palace, Southern Dipper cultivation charms, which are incredibly exquisite!"</p><p>"Northern Palace, Southern Dipper..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, thinking to himself that the name of this charm seemed to only invoke the power of the Northern and Southern Dipper constellations.</p><p>His cultivation of the Heavenly Demon Shaping Technique did not involve any specific stars, nor did the technique itself have such requirements.</p><p>From the beginning of his cultivation, he had indiscriminately drawn in all the starlight from the void, encompassing all the stars in the heavens.</p><p>His journey had been without fault.</p><p>If he were to only draw in the starlight of the two constellations, would it have an impact due to the incompleteness of the stars?</p><p>This matter concerned his own path, so Qin Sang naturally needed to clarify this incantation.</p><p>Upon hearing his question, the old Taoist smiled, "Friend Daoist, you've asked the right person. Three hundred years ago, I was fortunate enough to witness from afar the power of the Northern Palace Southern Dipper Preserving and Refining Incantation. Although the incantation's name suggests otherwise, it begins with the Big Dipper, drawing in the starlight from all the heavens.  As the saying goes, the Southern Dipper governs life, and ultimately the incantation is transferred to the Southern Dipper. The power of the stars in the heavens is incredibly vast and complex. Yet, this incantation is executed without the slightest disorder.  This is why it has such a great reputation."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's expression relaxed slightly. He would then see if the Xuanji Sect had experts who could help him break through.</p><p>Observing Qin Sang, the old Taoist softened his tone, reminding him, "Friend Daoist, don't rejoice too soon. The more profound the Northern Palace Southern Dipper Preserving and Refining Incantation is, the more difficult it is to cultivate, and the higher the demands placed on the caster.  Such individuals are not so easy to find…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged as he asked, "I wonder, how many within the Xuanji Sect have cultivated this incantation?"</p><p>The old Taoist held up one finger, "To my knowledge, there's only one!"</p><p>"One?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. Could it be the Sect Master of the Xuanji Sect?</p><p>"Only one, unless the Xuanji Sect has secretly produced another Dongxuan True Person," the old Taoist nodded.</p><p>A Dongxuan True Person is equivalent to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>In other words, only a Nascent Soul cultivator can cultivate this incantation. If he could enlist the full power of such a person, it would most likely satisfy Qin Sang's needs.</p><p>But the only person who has cultivated this incantation is the Xuanji Sect Master. As the old man said, the master of a sect is not so easily summoned.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang made a mental note of the Xuanji Sect, deciding to address it later. He still had thirty years.</p><p>He continued to question the old Taoist about similar incantations in other sects and received several leads.</p><p>The Dao Court also possesses similar incantations.</p><p>But after comparing them, the Xuanji Sect's Northern Palace Southern Dipper Preserving and Refining Incantation remained the most suitable.</p><p>"Thank you, Friend Daoist!"</p><p>Qin Sang produced a magical artifact and offered it to the old Taoist.</p><p>The old Taoist's eyes lit up at the sight of the artifact. He accepted it with a smile, "Friend Daoist, if you have any more questions, I will answer them truthfully. The crafting method of this artifact is quite profound, more than sufficient compensation for your previous question.  Unless it involves core secrets, I can freely share information going forward."</p><p>Cultivators in this world also use external artifacts, but this world relies more on divine powers and incantations. The three schools each have their strengths, and their power is equally formidable, unlike cultivators in the Storm World who depend so heavily on artifacts.</p><p>Of course, if they encountered superior artifacts or spiritual treasures, they wouldn't hesitate to compete for them.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed exceptional skills in artifact refinement and had the opportunity to showcase his abilities in this world, but he didn't have time to consider those matters now. He needed to address the immediate threat.</p><p>Since the old Taoist offered to help, Qin Sang didn't hesitate and carefully asked several questions he wanted answered, gaining much insight.</p><p>He left the shop.</p><p>It was late at night.</p><p>Before arriving, Qin Sang had heard that Jushan's night sky was exceptionally dark, with little visibility of stars and moon.</p><p>Looking up at the sky, this proved to be true.</p><p>A layer of dark clouds seemed to obscure the night sky, making the starlight hard to find. Only a ring of light in the sky indicated the moon.</p><p>Qin Sang, his sleeves fluttering, walked alone in the street, pondering his next move.</p><p>He had previously asked the old Taoist about two peculiar areas within Jushan that inexplicably attracted starlight.</p><p>Due to the unusual phenomenon, they were somewhat famous in Jushan, but many Daoist cultivators had investigated them without finding the cause.</p><p>Qin Sang obtained the relevant files and, after reviewing them, determined that the stellar energy in those two places wasn't sufficiently dense to meet his requirements, so he lost interest.</p><p>As per Qin Sang's habit, even if he thought of other solutions, he couldn't place all his hopes in one basket.  A two-pronged approach was necessary for success.</p><p>He still had to continue searching for places where stellar energy converged!</p><p>Not only the Dao Court existed in this world, but also the Gui Fang nation and the boundless Abyss and Wasteland.</p><p>Their absence in the Dao Court didn't mean they didn't exist elsewhere.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang remembered the snake and the wolf; it was time for them to play their part.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was not in a hurry to act; he hadn't yet met Shi Xuan and the others.</p><p>He crushed a jade talisman and stepped into a nearby inn.</p><p>The inn had private courtyards, each a cave dwelling.</p><p>After a short while, three people rushed into the inn, triggering the restriction.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>The restriction opened.</p><p>Shi Xuan was the first to enter the courtyard. Seeing Qin Sang, he bowed deeply, "The three of us greet our senior."</p><p>Facing Qin Sang again, Shi Xuan and the others seemed much calmer.</p><p>Their sect had numerous Shengxuan True Persons; earlier, they had been taken aback by the sudden revelation of Qin Sang's true cultivation level.</p><p>However, while their sect was powerful, that didn't mean they dared to offend a True Person, and their demeanor remained respectful.</p><p>"I apologize for keeping you waiting."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled warmly and gestured for them to sit.</p><p>The three men quickly bowed and sat down. Before Qin Sang could speak, Shi Xuan said, "Senior, after returning, we presented the tiger corpse to the Northern Pole Exorcism Office and received over ten thousand merits as a reward. We should return it to you."</p><p>"Ten thousand?" Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>The summoning talismans he had seen offered at most three thousand merits for killing a demon commander comparable to the tiger demon.  Yuan Ying-level talismans rarely offered more than ten thousand, and were extremely difficult.  Such a large amount of merit clearly wasn't just for the tiger demon; they must have stumbled upon some conspiracy.</p><p>Shi Xuan mentioned that the Northern Pole Exorcism Office wanted to speak with him.</p><p>"No rush," Qin Sang shook his head slightly.</p><p>Shi Xuan then recalled something and said solemnly, "Senior, I remember you were investigating the place where star energy converges. I took the liberty of asking my senior master, please punish me."</p><p>Qin Sang looked him up and down and said meaningfully, "What crime is there in helping me gather information? Not only will I not punish you, but I will reward you handsomely, regardless of the results!"</p><p>Shi Xuan seemed to breathe a sigh of relief and happily said, "Thanks to you, Senior, I have accomplished my mission. I learned of a place from my master, hidden in Jushan.  I don't know if the star energy there is sufficient to meet your requirements.”</p><p>Qin Sang became interested. After further questioning, he learned that the place was located far to the north of Heming Mountain, a hidden location named Xinggu Valley by a master from Jiuhua Cave Heaven.  From the description, the star energy was far richer than the other two places!</p><p>"Excellent!" Qin Sang praised, taking out a whip-like magical treasure from his Qianjun ring as a reward.</p><p>Shi Xuan eagerly accepted it.</p><p>Transferring the merit required a trip to the Daoist Court's headquarters. Qin Sang had already left a spiritual contract with the Daoist Court, so Shi Xuan and the others could directly transfer the merit to him without needing to appear in person. Qin Sang only wanted the whole numbers; the remainder was theirs to keep.</p><p>After Shi Xuan and the others left, Qin Sang stayed in the immortal city for two more days before leaving. This time, he left from the north gate and flew northeast. Near the border between the two opposing forces, he landed on a barren mountain and opened his spirit beast pouch.</p><p>'Bang! Bang!'</p><p>A snake and a wolf-dog tumbled out, baring their fangs at each other.</p><p>"Enough!" Qin Sang sternly shouted.</p><p>The two demons were startled and cowered.</p><p>"The territory occupied by the Guifang nation is not far ahead," Qin Sang told the snake demon, throwing a token to it.</p><p>The snake demon used its demonic wind to catch it, looking at Qin Sang with surprise and suspicion. It couldn't believe Qin Sang would let it go.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't let it go so easily. He needed a helper to infiltrate the Guifang nation and gather information for him. He planted the essence of the Bloodthirsty Swamp Spirit poison onto the snake demon.</p><p>He said to the snake demon, "Even with the token, gaining favor in the Guifang nation won't be easy.  We might as well cooperate."</p><p>"You... what do you want me to do, Immortal?" The snake demon was wary.</p><p>"I want merit too," Qin Sang pointed at it, then at himself.  "If the opportunity arises, we can help each other."</p><p>The snake demon was silent.  Though inexperienced, it understood the fate of spies was usually grim.</p><p>"Rest assured, I swear I'll always ask for your consent before doing anything. I won't force you into life-threatening missions. In a hundred years, I'll release you from the restriction.  However..." Qin Sang's tone turned cold, "If you betray me, think carefully. You were once captured by humans. Will they truly trust you?"</p><p>The snake demon trembled, silent for a long time before nodding. "I hope you keep your word."</p><p>Soon, the snake demon slithered away.</p><p>Qin Sang watched it go, considering it a calculated gamble. If the snake demon, with the token, made contact with the higher-ups in the Guifang nation, the hidden poison might be discovered.  Success would be welcome, but even if it escaped his control, he wouldn’t have lost anything.</p><p>The wolf-dog watched the snake demon's departure with envy.  However, Qin Sang had revealed too much to it when he first arrived, and couldn’t release it yet.</p><p></p>
