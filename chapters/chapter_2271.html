<h1>Chapter 2261: Heaven's Eye, Earth's Ear</h1><p>“Junior Brother has truly inherited the essence of the *Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun*?”</p><p>The two women entered the array, both stunned by Qin Sang's news.  Aside from everything else, the Yujishan array alone, if sufficiently manned at every key point, could repel Nascent Soul cultivators!  Even the meticulously crafted protective array of the Yuanjing Mountain was no match for this one.  The benefits of the *Su Wen Jing* and the array tests then exceeded their expectations.</p><p>“Senior Sisters, please observe this scripture…”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his sleeve, and a string of jade talismans flew out, neatly arranged.  The two women glanced at them, immediately absorbed in the profound scriptures, unable to extricate themselves.</p><p>“The complete text is so vast…”</p><p>After a long while, Qinghong and Shuangluo reluctantly withdrew their attention, filled with wonder.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, “Senior Sisters can study it at your leisure. Now, let's discuss how to manage this cave abode.”</p><p>The two women exchanged glances, “Junior Brother’s meaning is…?”</p><p>“This is a treasure.  We Yuanjing Mountain must secure it. I will contact the Dongliang Sect to request this area,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Qinghong nodded, her brows furrowed slightly, “That’s only right.  But what of the Dongliang Sect’s strength? If they refuse, we may have to take it by force…”</p><p>“Conveniently enough!”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, “The Dongliang Sect's Sect Master recently died in battle, reportedly taking several elders with him.  Many of the remaining elders have been deployed to the front. The sect is currently vulnerable, surrounded by covetous forces, and teetering on the brink of collapse.  If I approach them with an alliance proposal, simply requesting this small piece of land, it should be manageable.”</p><p>“Oh? I thought Junior Brother was planning to relocate the sect here,” Qinghong said.</p><p>Compared to Yuanjing Mountain, this place was undoubtedly more suitable as a sect headquarters.  But moving the disciples would require more land. Over the years, Qinghong, following Qin Sang's wishes, had continuously expanded the sect, and the number of disciples had grown significantly.  Now, the Tianjing Sect had been superseded by Yuanjing Mountain, and the Qingjiang Sect had been sidelined;  only this much land could accommodate Yuanjing Mountain's disciples.</p><p>Here, Qinghong remembered that not every disciple was suited to cultivating water and fire Dao, many had to abandon the Yin-Yang Dao and cultivate other methods, leading to internal discord. The return of the *Su Wen Jing* would finally solve this problem.</p><p>“Abandoning the established base at the current mountain would be a pity, and our Yuanjing Mountain’s foundation isn't strong enough to expose this location yet. This can serve as a last resort; if the sect is ever in danger, we can move here. Even a rabbit has three burrows. Until then, we'll present this as a secondary Yuanjing Mountain residence, only allowing tested inner disciples to train here. With the Immortal City’s flying boat, travel will be convenient…”</p><p>Qin Sang, having already considered all the details, had a plan.  The two women nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang summoned a jade pendant, splitting off two illusory images, which he gave to the women.</p><p>“These are the keys to the array. Senior Sisters can use these to control it,” Qin Sang paused, smiling slightly, “The array’s intricacies are beyond description; why not experience it yourselves?”</p><p>The two women were already eager to try.  Qin Sang's insights had been instrumental in their dual breakthroughs to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Qin Sang watched them enter the array with a smile, then, his smile fading, fell into contemplation.  With these gains, Yuanjing Mountain's future looked promising, but whether it would help him remained uncertain.  He did these things naturally, without great expectations.</p><p>Three years ago, there had been another tremor in the celestial mechanisms, making him feel increasingly urgent. It was time to return to the battlefield.</p><p>Shortly, the two women emerged from the array, looking spirited and clearly having reaped significant benefits.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang’s plans, the two women were reluctant but helpless; if Qin Sang didn’t go to war, they couldn't remain safely at the sect.</p><p>Shuangluo said sadly, “We're too weak to be of help to Junior Brother.”</p><p>“Junior Brother is destined for great things. Go with peace of mind; you needn't worry about the sect. My junior sister and I will guard the rear!”</p><p>Qinghong declared firmly.</p><p>Two months later, after finalizing his agreement with the Dongliang Sect and visiting the surrounding forces, Qin Sang bid farewell to his senior sisters and returned to the battlefield.</p><p>In this era, those who demonstrated sufficient talent were nurtured by the Immortal City. The Immortal City was very lenient towards people like Qin Sang; as long as they achieved sufficient military merit, their actions were unrestricted.</p><p>Qin Sang's previous merits were almost exhausted, but he quickly replenished them, moving freely between the camps.</p><p>He aimed to investigate the whereabouts of the demonic shadows among the demon race, but his concerns prevented reckless action, limiting his progress.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang, cultivating in a cave abode, was suddenly awakened.</p><p>“Celestial omen…again…”</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan's voice immediately followed.</p><p>Qin Sang asked, "Senior, is the treasure about to appear?"</p><p>"It should be... some time yet. You... focus on your cultivation... don't be impatient... don't disturb your state of mind..."</p><p>"I'm worried that my cultivation won't be sufficient when the treasure appears, and I'll ruin everything," Qin Sang said with a wry smile.</p><p>"You... are already fast enough... no one in the world can match you. If..." The mysterious Azure Bird paused, sighing, "...it's simply...fate..."</p><p>"I don't believe fate would favor the demonic forces from outside the world!"</p><p>Qin Sang declared, his fighting spirit soaring.</p><p>...</p><p>Over the next decade or so on the battlefield, Qin Sang's skills were nearly honed. It was time to attempt the breakthrough to the Transcendent Void stage.  Although he constantly worried about the imminent appearance of the treasure, he couldn't delay any longer; his cultivation speed was already defying logic.</p><p>One evening, Qin Sang left the battlefield and went to a place he had chosen long ago.  He set up a grand formation and contacted the mysterious Azure Bird.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>asked the mysterious Azure Bird.</p><p>"Senior, I believe I've reached my cultivation limit..."</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated. His rapid advancement had not brought him joy, but rather confusion.</p><p>"Hmm," The mysterious Azure Bird sensed his strange tone and waited for him to continue.</p><p>"But, I haven't reached the bottleneck as you said, Senior. It seems I've encountered a problem," Qin Sang scratched his head.  "Lately, I've been seeing an illusion."</p><p>"An illusion? What kind of illusion?"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird's tone grew tense.</p><p>Qin Sang's progress was astonishing, unprecedented. Without sufficient foundation or a commensurate state of mind, such forced growth would inevitably leave hidden dangers.  But the situation forced them to continue;  they dared not stop, even though they knew the risks were immense.</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird had anticipated this but still worried about Qin Sang.  The appearance of an illusion, at Qin Sang's current level, was likely a sign of demonic interference.  A burgeoning inner demon before even starting the breakthrough was extremely bad!</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird believed in Qin Sang's exceptional talent, but without sufficient experience, a calm mind couldn't be easily obtained.  What Qin Sang lacked was precisely experience. This was the most dangerous scenario, and it happened just as feared.</p><p>"It was very blurry at first, but recently it's become clearer. It seems to be a... pavilion..."</p><p>Qin Sang said hesitantly.</p><p>"A pavilion?" The mysterious Azure Bird was also surprised.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "I haven't seen it clearly yet, but it should be a pavilion with a unique design."</p><p>"Just... a pavilion? What's inside...?" The mysterious Azure Bird pressed further.</p><p>"Just a pavilion," Qin Sang stated firmly.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird was speechless.</p><p>It had assumed Qin Sang's inner demon stemmed from a deeply ingrained memory, or perhaps the loss of loved ones. It never expected it to be just a pavilion. This inexplicable inner demon was the most troublesome kind.</p><p>"Have you... ever... seen... this pavilion before? It might... be related to... a memory of yours..."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  "I've searched my memory thoroughly, but I've never seen it before, and I don't know where this pavilion is."</p><p>"Wait until you see it clearly... then we'll talk," said the mysterious Azure Bird.</p><p>Months later.</p><p>Qin Sang contacted the mysterious Azure Bird again. This time, he had 'seen' the stone pavilion completely and vividly described its details to the mysterious Azure Bird.</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird was silent for a moment, recalling its past.  Even in the Azure Bird clan territories it had visited, there was no such stone pavilion.</p><p>"Besides the pavilion... any other landmarks...?"</p><p>Qin Sang said, "An open space, and a clear sky."</p><p>"Wait a little longer... there might be more changes," If the mysterious Azure Bird were physically present, it would have a hundred ways to suppress Qin Sang's inner demon, but now it could only tell him to wait.</p><p>Qin Sang was patient. After a year, he reported to the mysterious Azure Bird, "The illusion... has stopped moving."  Anyone, with eyes open or closed, would find it hard to cultivate peacefully with a pavilion constantly floating before them. Inner demons were unreasonable; anything strange could happen.</p><p>"Senior," Qin Sang said, "Could such a stone pavilion really exist in the world?"</p><p>"Perhaps..."</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird remained noncommittal. It wasn't very hopeful, because the details Qin Sang described were too clear. If such a place existed, Qin Sang would surely have been there.  Unless something had happened then, causing a lapse in his memory, making him completely forget this experience.</p><p>In any case, finding this pavilion was the only way to resolve the issue. Searching from the outside would clearly be easier than searching Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>"Try... using your divine ability!" said the mysterious Azure Bird.</p><p>Qin Sang rejoiced. This was exactly what he had been waiting for.  It was said that powerful demon cultivators who had transformed into demon stars could monitor the world, and he intended to utilize this ability.</p><p>The style of stone pavilions might be similar, but the one at the Moon-Veiling Hermitage is unique.  The nuns there carved countless decorations onto it, each a different hand, making an exact replica practically impossible.</p><p>“However…”</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan’s tone shifted, warning Qin Sang of what to expect.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression grew serious.</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan possessed this ability to survey the world, but its use differed greatly depending on whether it performed the ability itself or through Qin Sang.  Even the Qingluan’s own power, it surmised, might struggle to overcome the inherent limitations and truly “see” the world directly.  Perhaps when Qin Sang’s cultivation advanced, he could do so, but for now, he would bear the full burden.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't sustain the ability for long.  The moment it activated, the images and information he "saw" would flood his mind in a torrent, a deluge he would willingly accept, placing a terrible strain on him.  </p><p>First, this would be overwhelming for Qin Sang. Second, as it wasn't his own direct vision but a divinely granted ability, the images would arrive chaotic and disorderly.  After the power faded, locating a small pavilion on such a vast expanse would be akin to searching for a needle in an ocean.</p><p>Therefore, before activating the ability, Qin Sang had to repeatedly visualize the pavilion, etching every detail firmly into his mind.  Then, once he "saw" it, he could immediately lock onto it. Other information would wash over him, minimizing the pressure.</p><p>This power was far more dangerous than anticipated, yet Qin Sang didn't hesitate, asking the mysterious Qingluan for assistance.</p><p>Seeing his resolve, the Qingluan remained silent, telling him to prepare.</p><p>Atop a hill...</p><p>Qin Sang had been meditating there for three days, motionless.  His mind held only one image: the stone pavilion.</p><p>Night fell, stars blazing overhead.</p><p>“Begin…”</p><p>A faint voice echoed in Qin Sang's mind.  He felt a mysterious energy surge into his body, his expression calm, his mental image unwavering.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang felt himself lifting off the ground.</p><p>His spirit seemed to leave his body, soaring into the sky, higher and higher, until he mingled with the stars. The earth shrunk dramatically; towering peaks became insignificant.  He felt as if he’d become one with the countless stars.</p><p>Suddenly, it was as though Qin Sang opened his eyes, seeing everything below him.</p><p>In an instant, countless images flooded his mind.</p><p>He saw the land beneath him, army camps on the battlefield.  He saw Lingkong Mountain to the east, and beyond it, the magnificent mountain ranges, presumably the Phoenix Clan’s territory.  </p><p>He even saw Yongtu Immortal City and, west of the city, the vast desert dotted with oases of varying sizes.</p><p>The detail was astonishing. He could even see a common mountain, a centipede battling a venomous spider in a crack in the rock face, trapped in the spider's web, facing certain death.</p><p>This must be the legendary ability to perceive heaven and earth, though he could only see, not hear.  It was extraordinary: his vision was limitless yet capable of discerning the minutest detail, except for areas obstructed by other objects or magical barriers.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a delusion of omnipotence, a feeling of being a celestial being, omniscient, capable of controlling everything; nothing could be hidden from his gaze.</p><p>Was this what it felt like to be a powerful cultivator?  Truly intoxicating!</p><p>Such ability could traverse Yongtu Immortal City and probe its depths – no wonder humans feared powerful demon cultivators so intensely.</p><p>“Aaargh!”</p><p>On the hilltop, Qin Sang let out a sharp cry, clutching his head.</p><p>A splitting headache threatened to shatter his skull.  He gasped for air, crimson blood flowing from his orifices.  Despite this great cost, he hadn’t found the pavilion!</p><p>Had Liuli not been reborn? Was the pavilion hidden? Or...had Liuli’s memories been erased after her rebirth?</p><p>After a long while…</p><p>“Senior,” Qin Sang asked in a hoarse whisper, “can you show me further?”</p>
