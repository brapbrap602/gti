<h1>Chapter 324: Soul-Gathering Grass</h1><p>The burly man held only three Thousand-Vine Flowers.</p><p>The potency of spiritual medicines varied greatly, making it difficult to determine their exact value.  But judging by the atmosphere in the auction hall, the Soul-Nourishing Fruit would undoubtedly fetch a high price. After weighing the pros and cons, most people began to back down.</p><p>However, the Thousand-Vine Flower was also a rare spiritual medicine.  It seemed that many were attempting to bypass bidding on the Soul-Nourishing Fruit and trade directly with the burly man.</p><p>Overwhelmed, the man cupped his hands and announced loudly, "I only wish to exchange for a Soul-Nourishing Fruit, or a similar elixir that can nourish the soul.  Fellow Daoists, if you do not possess such an item, please save your breath."</p><p>Despite this brief commotion, the auction of the Soul-Nourishing Fruit proceeded uninterrupted, the price steadily climbing.</p><p>Unfortunately, many were vying for the fruit, driving the price far beyond its inherent value.  A few who were interested in the Thousand-Vine Flowers made a few attempts to raise their bids, but eventually retreated.</p><p>Qin Sang made two bids before deciding to give up.</p><p>It wasn't worth spending so much on a few Thousand-Vine Flowers that held no immediate use for him.</p><p>Ultimately, the Soul-Nourishing Fruit was claimed by a female cultivator at a price that left the burly man in despair.  She clearly had no intention of trading for the flowers; it seemed the Soul-Nourishing Fruit was precisely what she needed.</p><p>Dejected, the man slumped back in his chair.</p><p>Some persisted in trying to negotiate a trade with him, but he refused them all.</p><p>The auction continued without pause, with various items being sold.  Sadly, nothing else with similar properties to the Soul-Nourishing Fruit appeared.</p><p>"The next item! Soul-Gathering Grass!"</p><p>Gao Yi's enthusiastic voice jolted Qin Sang.  He had been cautious in his previous bids, reluctantly purchasing only a Phoenix-Fall Vine of similar quality to the Earthfire Tung, for fear of depleting his spirit stones before the Soul-Gathering Grass appeared.</p><p>Finally, the moment had arrived!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Gao Yi whipped away the red cloth, revealing three jade boxes arranged side by side on the tray!</p><p>Inside each box was a Soul-Gathering Grass plant, dug up roots and all!</p><p>The Soul-Gathering Grass was jet black. Three leaves sprouted from its base, not in separate directions, but intertwined like vines, converging at the top to form a bud-like shape, a peculiar sight.</p><p>During its growth, the Soul-Gathering Grass transitioned through white, green, dark green, and finally, jet black â€“ a sign of maturity!</p><p>The appearance of the Soul-Gathering Grass caused an uproar in the hall, with several gasps of astonishment.</p><p>Some even leaped to their feet, eyes fixed on the tray, burning with fervor.</p><p>Many cultivators who had previously spent lavishly now sighed with regret.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened; he had a bad feeling.  It seemed he had underestimated the allure of the Soul-Gathering Grass to demonic and unorthodox cultivators.</p><p>Each leaf could be refined into a Celestial Corpse Talisman, meaning one plant could yield three. While there was a chance of failure, Qin Sang had been studying the *Celestial Yin Corpse Scripture* for some time and was confident he could refine at least two.</p><p>Judging by the frenzied reactions, the competition for the Soul-Gathering Grass would be fierce.  Qin Sang didn't dare hope to acquire all three plants.</p><p>He would preemptively strike, sparing no expense to secure the first plant, then assess the situation for the remaining two.</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind.</p><p>With his resources, he should be able to secure the first plant, though the price would likely exceed his expectations.</p><p>Still, obtaining at least two living corpses would be worth it.</p><p>"Three mature Soul-Gathering Grass plants, beneficial to the cultivation techniques of many demonic and unorthodox Daoist friends. It seems everyone is aware of their value. I will only briefly introduce..."</p><p>Gao Yi announced the starting price with a slight smirk.</p><p>"The owner requires that all three Soul-Gathering Grass plants be auctioned together, preferring them to go unsold rather than be separated.  The starting bid is one talismanic treasure with at least 70% of its power remaining, preferably an offensive type!"</p><p>All three together!</p><p>Not spirit stones, nor artifacts, nor elixirs, but a talismanic treasure!</p><p>This condition doused the heated atmosphere like a bucket of cold water.</p><p>Silence fell over the hall as everyone exchanged bewildered glances.</p><p>How many among these Foundation Establishment cultivators were fortunate enough to possess a talismanic treasure?</p><p>Furthermore, the requirement of 70% remaining power was extremely demanding.</p><p>"This old man offers 7,000 low-grade spirit stones to purchase a talismanic treasure in exchange for the Soul-Gathering Grass.  Would any fellow Daoist be willing to part with one?" a raspy voice called out.</p><p>7,000 low-grade spirit stones could buy two high-quality top-grade artifacts.  It was a fair price for a talismanic treasure.</p><p>However, no one would sell at that price.</p><p>"7,000 spirit stones for a talismanic treasure?  You jest, fellow Daoist!  I offer 7,500!" another voice immediately countered.</p><p>"8,000!"</p><p>...</p><p>The price climbed to 9,000 spirit stones, with only a few still able to compete.</p><p>Yet, only their voices echoed in the hall. No one responded; clearly, mere spirit stones were insufficient to tempt those who possessed talismanic treasures.</p><p>"Two top-grade artifacts, plus 2,000 spirit stones! Will anyone trade?"</p><p>Finally, someone offered alternative items for exchange.  The strained tone in his voice betrayed his reluctance; he was likely offering his own personal artifacts.</p><p>Qin Sang, having participated in the bidding, quickly realized this approach wouldn't work. He carefully observed the crowd.</p><p>Gao Yi stood on the platform, a smile playing on his lips as he watched the bidding war unfold.</p><p>Below, several people were communicating with Gao Yi through voice transmissions. Qin Sang could guess their intentions: they hoped to purchase the Soul-Gathering Grass plants separately or negotiate other terms.</p><p>They seemed to have been refused, each sighing in disappointment.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang noticed a few individuals who caught his attention.</p><p>A woman in red.</p><p>A Daoist priest in a dark blue-green robe, his face uncovered by any artifacts.</p><p>A lean young man clad in armor.</p><p>A boy who looked no older than a teenager, a faint smile playing on his lips.</p><p>...</p><p>They shared a common trait: their auras were remarkably subtle, unreadable to Qin Sang. He suspected they were likely late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>These individuals were all fixated on the Soul-Gathering Grass, silent, seemingly weighing the value of exchanging a talismanic treasure.  They ignored the escalating bids, completely unmoved.</p><p>This raised a red flag for Qin Sang.</p><p>The auction house at Yin Mountain Pass was renowned, attracting many powerful cultivators. It was not unusual for a few to possess talismanic treasures.</p><p>For these individuals, spirit stones and top-grade artifacts were not necessities. Only equally rare treasures could entice them.</p><p>Even if he offered his spirit stones, artifacts, and the near-broken Silver Knife talismanic treasure, he would at best be locked in a stalemate.</p><p>Besides those, he only had two thousand-year-old spiritual medicines of value.</p><p>If he was unwilling to part with the medicines, and the price continued to rise, he would be the first to give up.  His resources simply couldn't compare to theirs.</p>
