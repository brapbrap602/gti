<h1></h1><p>As Qin Sang moved, the divine inscription on his left arm gradually faded.</p><p>The power of the divine inscription was fully unleashed.</p><p>Finally, only a crescent blood moon remained on the back of Qin Sang's left hand.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the blood moon, focusing his senses.</p><p>Gradually, the blood moon's luster receded, leaving only a blood moon-shaped mark, the unique aura sealed within it.</p><p>"No reaction..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>The blood moon offered no feedback, indicating the Nascent Soul remains weren't nearby.</p><p>Qin Sang was unsure of the mark's sensing range, as Ghost Mother had been vague. He could only take it one step at a time.</p><p>The mark remained on his hand, causing no interference.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his hand, dismissing it, then looked up at the cliff top. With a thought, his Second Nascent Soul flew out from his crown, summoning his External Avatar.</p><p>He intended to have his avatar scout the terrain of the Formless Immortal Sect's inner territory.</p><p>The avatar summoned the Snow-Treading Divine Saber, preparing to depart.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered something. The Myriadéˆž Ring shimmered, and a blood-wrapped crocodile bone flew out.</p><p>It was the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand Qin Sang had refined earlier.</p><p>The crocodile bone possessed remarkable power and was controlled through the blood hand. Giving it to his avatar would provide an additional means of defense.</p><p>Prior to this, the avatar had refined the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand. He took the blood glove, wore it on his hand, stowed the crocodile bone, and stealthily vanished into the darkness towards the depths of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang watched his External Avatar disappear into the forest and emerged from his hiding place.</p><p>By now, Zhu Wudao and the others had broken through the crimson mist, ascended the cliff top, and used the crystal stele to summon the illusory image of the ancient temple.</p><p>From the cliff base, the radiant light diffusing from the top was visible.</p><p>Qin Sang no longer hesitated and climbed along the stone path Zhu Wudao and the others had forged.</p><p>The stone path was winding.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended at a moderate pace, commanding the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to closely monitor the changes in the phenomena atop the cliff.</p><p>Through the butterfly's eyes, he saw faint spatial fluctuations flash within the pavilion where True Person Zi Lei and Yue Lingtian were hiding. The two finally emerged from the stone pavilion, but paused again just before reaching the summit.</p><p>Sensing something, True Person Zi Lei's expression shifted, and he suddenly glanced down the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, darting to the edge of the stone path and concealing himself using the remnants of the restrictive formations.</p><p>Noticing True Person Zi Lei's action, Yue Lingtian inquired through sound transmission.</p><p>True Person Zi Lei mused, "Including Junior Brother, only four have ascended the cliff."</p><p>"A bunch of rabble!"</p><p>Yue Lingtian scoffed. "Some seek opportunities within the Immortal Palace, others covet the Formless Immortal Sect's legacy treasures. They're not aligned. The Celestial Concord Hall's teleportation formation is within the ancient temple. The overall situation is settled. No matter how many insignificant figures there are, they can't stir up any real trouble!"</p><p>The Cloud Carving Dragon blocking the path to the Formless Immortal Sect was a double-edged sword. While Hua Chenzi couldn't enter in time, most of the Formless Immortal Sect remnants were also kept out.</p><p>With him, True Person Zi Lei, and True Person He Gao joining forces, who would dare to obstruct them?</p><p>True Person Zi Lei nodded slightly, also believing that even if someone was hiding below, it wouldn't affect the overall situation. To avoid further complications, he withdrew his gaze.</p><p>Atop the cliff.</p><p>The statue within Zhu Wudao's sleeve was scorching hot.</p><p>He remained unperturbed, raising his hand and pressing it against the ancient temple door.</p><p>The door was sealed by restrictive formations, but due to damage to the temple structure, numerous flaws had appeared in the formations. Zhu Wudao's eyes shone with divine light as he focused on deciphering them.</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master and the other two also arrived at the door, dividing the task of breaking the formations.</p><p>Soon, Zhu Wudao formed a hand seal with a single hand and abruptly struck out. A golden handprint landed squarely in the center of the temple door.</p><p>Despite the lack of communication, the Wailing Spirit Cave Master and the other two cooperated with remarkable tacit understanding.</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master summoned a wooden thorn-like treasure, holding it between two fingers. Infusing it with True Essence, the wooden thorn shot out a black thread that pierced directly into the formation, clearly a treasure specifically designed for breaking restrictive formations.</p><p>The Swordsman stuck to his tried-and-true method.</p><p>He employed saber techniques with his sword, but unlike his previous wide and sweeping style, his saber light was now restrained and subtle, silently wedging into the formation, demonstrating remarkably refined saber artistry.</p><p>Mo Xingdao couldn't help but glance sideways. He also summoned a silver bell-shaped magical treasure. The silver bell was small and delicate, and Mo Xingdao held it in his hand, gently shaking it.</p><p>No bell sound could be heard, but visible ripples emanated, drifting towards the temple door.</p><p>With the combined efforts of the four, the restrictive formations on the temple door finally reached their breaking point. The door trembled violently, radiating brilliant light, which quickly dimmed.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>Zhu Wudao pushed open the temple door, revealing the scene within.</p><p>Unexpectedly, despite the vastness of the hall, its furnishings were so simple as to be described as crude.</p><p>Grand yet empty!</p><p>Within the hall stood only four jade pillars, carved with dragons and phoenixes, depicting various divine birds and beasts. The carvings were exquisite, as if they truly carried a trace of the beasts' divine essence, ready to step down from the pillars at any moment.</p><p>This was clearly not the work of ordinary hands.</p><p>The jade pillars supported the hall.</p><p>In addition, a mass of azure light floated between the four pillars.</p><p>Within the azure light was a teleportation formation!</p><p>Two meditation cushions were placed at the edge of the formation, suggesting that cultivators once guarded it. Now, they were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Upon seeing the teleportation formation, the four's eyes lit up. They didn't delve into why the hall was so spartan, their gazes fixated on the formation.</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master hesitated, pausing at the entrance to observe Zhu Wudao's actions.</p><p>"There shouldn't be any traps within the ancient temple..."</p><p>Zhu Wudao said, flashing into the hall and directly towards the teleportation formation. As expected, there were no obstructions.</p><p>Up close, they realized how truly intricate the formation was.</p><p>Suspended in mid-air, the formation connected with the earth's energy. Its restrictive formations were exceptionally complex, rivaling rare ancient teleportation formations, a masterpiece nearly impossible for contemporary cultivators to achieve.</p><p>This formation could bypass the Immortal Palace's outer restrictions, directly entering the palace from the Southern Border.</p><p>Both Daoist and Buddhist sects controlled the Immortal Palace, yet neither had achieved this.</p><p>Zhu Wudao and the others were captivated, marveling at the formation, wondering if the Formless Immortal Sect had perhaps relocated an ancient formation, thoroughly comprehending and modifying it.</p><p>Even so, the difficulty was unimaginable.</p><p>With the teleportation formation before them, the Immortal Palace was but a step away.</p><p>Yet their expressions became even more solemn.</p><p>Zhu Wudao circled the formation twice and, under the others' eager gazes, nodded. "Heaven favors us. The teleportation formation is intact!"</p><p>Hearing this, the Wailing Spirit Cave Master and the other two sighed in relief. They could discern some clues, but only dared to confirm after Zhu Wudao's verification.</p><p>Even now, Zhu Wudao showed no intention of driving the others away and monopolizing the Immortal Palace.</p><p>The three tacitly allowed Zhu Wudao to fly above the teleportation formation.</p><p>Zhu Wudao performed a series of hand seals. After some effort, the teleportation formation slowly began to rotate, its energy pulling. The already damaged hall trembled, making them worry it might collapse.</p><p>At this moment,</p><p>Streaks of light leaped from Zhu Wudao's Mustard Seed Bag, all high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>The South Sea region wasn't large, and the distance between the Southern Border and the Immortal Palace wasn't excessively far. To be safe, Zhu Wudao used only high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>'Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...'</p><p>The spirit stones embedded themselves into the formation's apertures.</p><p>Instantly, the formation vibrated, and a thick beam of azure light erupted, nearly shattering the hall.</p><p>While the Wailing Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xingdao were still observing, the Swordsman suddenly leaped, flying above the formation and directly facing Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Simultaneously, two streaks of light landed at the entrance of the ancient temple.</p><p>True Person Zi Lei and Yue Lingtian finally appeared!</p><p>"Eight Sceneries Pavilion!"</p><p>Hearing the sound of breaking air and seeing True Person Zi Lei, the Wailing Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xingdao's expressions drastically changed. They quickly flashed to the other side of the teleportation formation, exchanged glances, then looked at the Swordsman.</p><p>His identity was now clear!</p><p>Staring at Zhu Wudao, the Swordsman no longer concealed himself. His bones cracked as he rapidly thinned, his appearance undergoing a drastic transformation.</p><p>Light flickered, and the Swordsman transformed into a gaunt Daoist priest, none other than True Person He Gao!</p><p>"Greetings, Seat Master Zhu. Long time no see."</p><p>True Person He Gao offered a greeting.</p><p>Zhu Wudao was the Seat Master of the Quyang Mountain branch of the Heavenly Hao Tower, a renowned figure even in the Central Continent. True Person He Gao had interacted with him several times and was relatively familiar with him.</p><p>Before Zhu Wudao's exposure, he never imagined this person to be a Formless Immortal Sect remnant!</p><p>'Thump! Thump!'</p><p>Footsteps echoed through the hall.</p><p>True Person Zi Lei approached slowly, without summoning any magical treasures or techniques. Moreover, he was looking at the teleportation formation.</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xingdao subconsciously held their breaths, their faces grave.</p><p>The Eight Sceneries Pavilion and Mount Taiyue, three great cultivators arrived together, two of whom were Sect Master-level powerhouses.</p><p>Zhu Wudao remained calm in the face of danger, narrowing his eyes, then suddenly letting out a relaxed chuckle. "I wondered why it was so smooth. I hadn't even used all my tricks before successfully opening the Immortal Sect's legacy grounds. I'd always felt a force lurking in the shadows, flickering in and out of existence. I initially assumed it was another group of Formless Immortal Sect descendants. Turns out, it was you! What, are the two Immortal Palaces and the Daoist lineage's inheritance not enough to satisfy Pavilion Master's appetite? You've now set your sights on the Formless Immortal Sect's legacy grounds?"</p><p>His tone grew increasingly relaxed as he glanced behind True Person Zi Lei. "Where's the old baldy?"</p><p>As he spoke,</p><p>The phenomena surrounding the teleportation formation intensified.</p><p>The ancient temple, under the strain, trembled violently once more.</p><p>Dense azure light surged from the temple.</p><p>At the temple entrance, another figure was illuminated by the formation's spiritual light â€“ Qin Sang, who had sensed the spatial fluctuations and rushed over.</p><p>Atop the sheer cliff,</p><p>Seven great cultivators were finally gathered.</p><p>Everyone was surprised.</p><p>They had assumed the newcomer was Su Zinan or others who had left earlier.  Instead, it was an unfamiliar face, and seemingly not aligned with True Person Zi Lei.</p><p>"Seize him!"</p><p>True Person Zi Lei, without turning his head, shifted his gaze and abruptly fixed it on Zhu Wudao.</p><p>True Person He Gao had been itching for action. Due to his senior brother's presence, he hadn't dared to act independently. Receiving the command, he immediately summoned his natal magical treasure, the Jade Smoke Torrent.</p><p>Myriad Lights Thousand Illusions.</p><p>The wisps of smoke instantly transformed into a torrential flow, a white streak lashing towards Zhu Wudao's face.</p><p>"Do you all still intend to watch the show? Do you think the Eight Sceneries Pavilion will share the Immortal Palace's opportunities with you?"</p><p>Simultaneously with True Person Zi Lei's command, Zhu Wudao roared.</p><p>These words were not only directed at the Wailing Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xingdao, but also at the newly arrived Qin Sang. Anyone not allied with the Daoist sect could be exploited!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>True Person Zi Lei moved like lightning, darting towards the teleportation formation.</p><p>Along the way, he raised his right hand, his five fingers slightly curved. Purple light swirled, and the sound of thunder echoed through the ancient temple, deafeningly loud. Abruptly, he shot out five bolts of purple lightning.</p><p>The lightning bolts, thick as pythons, intertwined with the white streak, piercing through the air.</p><p>In truth, capturing Zhu Wudao was secondary. Seizing the initiative was the true goal.</p><p>Yue Lingtian's movements were equally swift. He stomped heavily on the ground, and Primordial Yellow energy emanated from the floor, forming an intricate diagram beneath the teleportation formation.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Over a dozen Primordial Yellow light pillars erupted.</p><p>The heavy pillars surrounded the teleportation formation like a cage, attempting to seal it within.</p><p>From the moment Zhu Wudao activated the formation, to the appearance of True Person Zi Lei, Yue Lingtian, and Qin Sang, and then True Person Zi Lei's attack, all transpired within the blink of an eye.</p><p>However, everyone present had cultivated for many years. Even sudden changes didn't hinder their judgment.</p><p>Although the three's techniques were fierce, the Wailing Spirit Cave Master and the others' counterattacks were equally impressive.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's fate was irrelevant to them, but his words held truth.</p><p>After the Eight Sceneries Pavilion and Sweet Dew Chan Monastery occupied the Immortal Palace, they had never been known to share opportunities. Their domineering actions were notorious, and today would likely be no exception.</p><p>Even Qin Sang made his move.</p><p>He entered the ancient temple, flashing to the side of the hall. The Goldfall Sword pierced the air, its light faster than a meteor, vanishing mid-air and transforming into a sword formation. However, he deliberately avoided True Person Zi Lei and Yue Lingtian, his target firmly fixed on the teleportation formation.</p><p>The Eight Sceneries Pavilion and Sweet Dew Chan Monastery's occupation of the Immortal Palace was no secret. The two sects had other means of entry, but they didn't. The teleportation formation was their only path!</p><p>Qin Sang and the others didn't know the details, assuming True Person Zi Lei merely wanted to eliminate future threats, easily severing their chance of entering the Immortal Palace by destroying the formation.</p><p>Undoubtedly, protecting the teleportation formation was paramount!</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, why resort to such drastic measures? Why not sit down and talk?" Qin Sang appealed sincerely.</p><p>Within the void, sword threads surged, cascading downwards.</p><p>Just at this moment, the Primordial Yellow light commanded by Yue Lingtian erupted.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Primordial Yellow light, halfway to its target, suddenly dimmed, enveloped by the sword formation.</p><p>For a time, the Primordial Yellow pillars were significantly impeded, their surfaces becoming mottled and riddled with holes, forcibly suppressed by the sword formation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yue Lingtian, meeting for the first time, exchanged a blow from afar.</p><p>Yue Lingtian's expression shifted slightly. He responded by summoning a three-legged cauldron. It spun rapidly, crashing into the sword formation.</p><p>Without a word, not only Qin Sang, but also the Wailing Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xingdao adopted the same approach.</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master's red flower magical treasure never left his side. With a thought, the treasure transformed into a rainbow, flying above the teleportation formation. The flower crown inverted, like a canopy, unleashing a torrent of violent spiritual power, sweeping away any force attempting to approach the formation.</p><p>Mo Xingdao secretly formed a hand seal, hesitated, then changed it to another seal. His throat pulsed, and he opened his mouth, expelling a stream of white profound energy.</p><p>This profound energy was unexpectedly sharp, as swift as a sword ray, daring to directly confront the purple lightning unleashed by True Person Zi Lei.</p><p>Simultaneously, everyone charged towards the teleportation formation.</p><p>For a moment, the ancient temple's interior was filled with a chaotic explosion of intermingling light.</p><p>Zhu Wudao stood at the center of the storm, his every move influencing the situation.</p><p>At this critical juncture,</p><p>The relaxed expression vanished from Zhu Wudao's face. With the Jade Smoke Torrent upon him, he neither dodged nor retreated. His upper body straightened, and in an instant, golden light blazed brilliantly.</p><p>Golden light enveloped him, containing endless runes.</p><p>The light refracted, the runes rearranged. After a dizzying transformation, Zhu Wudao was clad in a suit of golden armor!</p><p>The armor's luster flowed over his body, no mere illusion, but a tangible object.</p><p>Based on its appearance alone, no one doubted the armor's resilience.</p><p>Zhu Wudao, still unsatisfied, his tongue cracked like spring thunder, prepared to unleash further techniques or treasures.</p><p>As the battle for the formation was about to begin,</p><p>At this moment, the teleportation formation absorbed the spirit stones' energy, and the spatial fluctuations became increasingly pronounced. The teleportation light brightened to its peak.</p><p>Suddenly, it extinguished!</p>
