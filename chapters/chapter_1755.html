<h1>Chapter 1746  A World Turned Upside Down</h1><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>Spiritual energy in the forest suddenly surged towards a mountain, only to disperse violently a moment later.  The intense spiritual waves created a gale, bending and breaking trees, sending withered leaves swirling through the air.</p><p>The island's spirits, accustomed to the volatile weather of the sea, were nonetheless shaken to their core by the immense pressure in the wind.</p><p>Besides the animal spirits, numerous plant spirits inhabited the forest.</p><p>These plant spirits were not particularly powerful; most lacked the ability to move their physical forms and could only withdraw their consciousness into their bodies, trembling.</p><p>A few ancient trees and spiritual herbs, however, reacted differently.  Some stretched out their roots like a thousand legs, fleeing across the forest floor; others transformed into bolts of green light, shooting outwards, with a vibrant green herb clearly visible within the light.</p><p>After the celestial phenomenon subsided, the mountain remained eerily silent.</p><p>Inside the cave,</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to have recovered, sitting cross-legged, but his brow remained deeply furrowed.  His injuries to his foundation were still unhealed, and the recent upheaval had nearly undone his progress.</p><p>“This spiritual energy is unlike that of the Storm World…”</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head slightly, gazing at a wisp of ethereal energy in his palm.</p><p>He referred to the small world he had previously been in as the Storm World.</p><p>The spiritual energy here was incredibly rich, far exceeding that of the Storm World, yet it felt… wrong.</p><p>Upon first arriving, he had sensed something amiss, but, grievously injured and desperate to escape, he'd attributed it to his condition and hadn’t given it much thought.</p><p>He now held a demon pill and a section of demon bone in his other hand – remnants from his hunt of the thunder turtle in the Storm Belt.  A quick sense confirmed the chaotic spiritual energy. The thunder turtle, likely a native of this world, must have cultivated using this area's energy, gradually becoming affected itself.</p><p>His eyes flickered.</p><p>He had previously assumed the thunder turtle's behavior was due to the Heavenly Demon's Sound, but now it seemed far more complex.</p><p>He hesitated, unsure if he had truly left the Storm World or if he’d fallen into the Abyss.</p><p>From outward appearances, the Abyss was chaotic and incredibly dangerous, nothing like this calm.  However, cultivators from the Storm World knew little about the Abyss; no one knew what worlds lay beyond its depths.</p><p>Recalling various texts he had read, even before the Heavenly Demon's Sound, the Abyss beasts were violently cruel and incapable of normal communication.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered:  Could this be due to cultivating in this chaotic energy, affecting their souls and leading to their savage natures?</p><p>His expression darkened.</p><p>With the Jade Buddha, he wasn't worried about his own nature being affected, but who knew what other effects long-term absorption of this chaotic energy might have?</p><p>He had already determined that directly absorbing this chaotic energy would affect even his stable True Essence, stirring his energy sea, and severely impacting his cultivation foundation.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang released his divine sense.</p><p>The forest was gradually returning to normal. One tree spirit darted to the edge of the woods, stopping, its body faintly glowing green as the light gathered towards its crown.  Its branches danced, encircling the green glow like an eye, observing behind it.</p><p>At that moment, a transparent hand materialized in the air above the tree spirit, seizing it. The ground trembled slightly as the tree spirit was uprooted and vanished instantly.</p><p>An ancient tree now stood before the cave.</p><p>A ball of green light, the tree spirit's essence, floated before Qin Sang.</p><p>The tree spirit, not yet enlightened, was instinctively terrified of Qin Sang; the green light trembled violently.</p><p>Although Qin Sang still possessed Imperial Dew, he didn't want to waste it on such a minor spirit. He sent a strand of divine sense into the green light.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense, sighing inwardly.</p><p>As expected, the tree spirit's cultivation, by the standards of the Storm World, was only recently in the Spirit Realm, equivalent to a Foundation Establishment cultivator in the human world.</p><p>In the Storm World, even unenlightened spirits possessed considerable intelligence; this tree spirit's intelligence was far lower than normal, and its nature was inherently ferocious and agitated.</p><p>No wonder he had sensed an oppressive, malevolent atmosphere in the forest upon arrival.  It wasn’t a benevolent place.</p><p>Normally, plant spirits born in the wilderness, without consuming blood, were mostly innocent.</p><p>But this island, seemingly calm, experienced periods of brutal slaughter, all caused by that ferocious aura.  Once the killing intent arose, it ignited their ferocity, engulfing all the spirits on the island.</p><p>He then captured a newly born flower spirit. Its nature was significantly milder than the tree spirit, yet that same ferocious intent was deeply rooted.</p><p>Is it the fate of all beings in this world to become ferocious beasts?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, entering meditation once more. He carefully refined and processed the world's elemental energy, separating the five elemental energies. He found he could do it, but it took several times longer than in the Storm World.  Cultivating in this world, he wondered how many years it would take to reach the Transcendence stage.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang patiently continued to refine the energy, slowly absorbing it into his body.  There was no better way for now, so he could only endure, waiting until he recovered his strength before searching for fellow cultivators in this world to see how they practiced.</p><p>"This world can't be full of demons and monsters, can it?"  Qin Sang muttered to himself. He had plenty of time, and there were no powerful妖兽 (demon beasts) watching this island.</p><p>While using the pills and spirit stones from the Qianjun Ring would speed up his recovery, he hadn’t brought many. In the Storm World, he was the foremost expert, never needing to rely on spirit stones for combat, so he had left most of his at his sect.  Activating the summoning platform used up his only remaining top-grade spirit stone.</p><p>If other places in this world were the same, he could infer that the spirit stones formed in this elemental energy were probably not normal spirit stones.  The remaining pills and spirit stones he had were probably his only recourse in future battles, and he couldn't use them lightly.</p><p>Days blurred in the cave. Qin Sang’s injuries and cultivation slowly recovered. After a few days, he suddenly emerged from meditation, rising abruptly and looking down at himself, his expression shifting between gloom and uncertainty.</p><p>During this time, he had tirelessly refined and absorbed the elemental energy. At first, he didn't notice, but today he suddenly felt a recurrence of the chaos in his true essence.</p><p>The signs were still subtle. His approach was clearly effective, but it couldn't eliminate the problem.  The energy he had thought he'd purified seemed to contain some kind of chaotic energy he couldn't detect, invading his body.  And the manifestation of this chaotic energy further unsettled Qin Sang.</p><p>The chaotic energy didn't entirely originate within him; his true essence was actually being triggered by external chaotic energy, leaving him without the complete control he once possessed. At this point, his true essence had only recovered to the initial stage of Golden Core cultivation.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang tried to isolate the internal and external energies, and the situation immediately improved, but his mood didn't improve as a result. He began to suspect something.</p><p>Qin Sang sat down again, this time not wasting time refining energy. Instead, he took a pill and held a high-grade spirit stone in each hand, quickly recovering his strength.</p><p>After ten months, he had recovered to the Nascent Soul stage. His true essence was stable, but now he had to use his spiritual sense to stabilize it, sealing his energies and cutting himself off from the outside to avoid being affected by the chaotic energy.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang had guessed the reason. Cultivators could not exist in isolation from the world.  In fact, the higher the cultivation, the more one pursued harmony with nature.  Internal and external energies were not completely isolated; they constantly interacted, making it impossible to avoid being influenced by the external world. Even the true essence obtained from refining pills and spirit stones would eventually be triggered and invaded by the world's chaotic energy over time.</p><p>His spiritual sense was powerful, unconsciously suppressing it.  Since he had only recently arrived in this world, the influence was still shallow, and his impaired cultivation didn't require conscious use of his spiritual sense. But as his cultivation gradually recovered, the connection between internal and external energies deepened, requiring constant maintenance.  And he also had to use part of his spiritual sense to suppress the Kirin Primordial Seed.  He calculated that his recovery would probably be limited to the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>This wasn't a long-term solution.  His spiritual sense was tied up, hindering him, not to mention how he would cultivate in the future. Would he have to completely abandon the path of Qi Refinement?  Perhaps after refining the Kirin Primordial Seed and greatly improving his spiritual sense, there would be a chance.</p><p>But his primary cultivation technique was the "Chapter of Soul Cultivation and Sword Nurturing", and no matter how strong his physical body and spiritual sense became, they couldn't help him break through his current limitations; this was only a stopgap measure.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes opened slightly, his gaze like lightning, seeming to pierce through the cave and look towards the boundless sky beyond.</p><p>He wondered if there were any cultivators in this world. If there were, Qin Sang didn't believe everyone had as powerful a spiritual sense as he did. There must be a solution!</p><p>"The most important thing now is to contact the cultivators of this world!" Qin Sang made up his mind, stopped his cultivation, maintaining only his initial Nascent Soul stage, and turned his thoughts to other matters. Now that his blood and energy were gradually stabilizing, his body refining cultivation wasn't too greatly hindered.</p><p>"How will this world's chaotic energy affect body refinement?"  Qin Sang had this thought and immediately tried practicing the "Heavenly Demon Body Refining Technique."</p><p>He no longer had the Star Platform, so Qin Sang could only directly draw in stellar energy himself. He stepped outside the cave, sat down on a flat rock in the valley, and looked up at the sky.  It happened to be a full moon night.</p><p>The bright moon hung high in the sky, and the stars were scattered across the heavens.</p><p>The bright moonlight bathed the mountain, illuminating it as brightly as day.  Qin Sang found the moon's radiance almost blinding.</p><p>The stars here seemed no different from the Storm World, but the moon was far brighter, its halo noticeably larger.  The moon's light varied in intensity, brightest at its center, as if another silver disc were embedded within.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, vaguely perceiving a second circle within the moon, as if two moons overlapped, illuminating this world. This celestial phenomenon indicated a difference between this realm and the Storm World.</p><p>Composing himself, Qin Sang performed the Heavenly Demon Transformation, calming his agitated blood, then silently cultivated the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*.  During his decades in the Storm Belt, he had never ceased his body refinement, and with the fortuitous treasures gathered from various regions of the Storm World, he was not far from the late fourth stage. He still possessed the spiritual liquid from the Dragon Transformation Pond, promising smooth progress in his cultivation.</p><p>Starlight entered his body, the stellar煞 being blocked by the jade Buddha; the sensation was much like the Storm World.  But after only an incense stick's worth of time, Qin Sang abruptly stopped, his expression slightly surprised, then hurriedly resumed his cultivation.</p><p>Three hours later.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft sigh, slowly ending his cultivation, a strange light flashing in his eyes. He murmured to himself, "To think the chaotic world has this benefit... a case of losing at one point, only to gain at another, perhaps?"</p><p>During his body refinement, he'd discovered that the chaotic energy impacting his blood had an unexpectedly beneficial effect on his physical body, significantly increasing his cultivation speed.</p><p>"No wonder there are so many monsters," he mused, scanning the boundless forest below.  "Could this be a demonic realm?"</p><p>The chaotic celestial energy made cultivation far easier for monsters than in the Storm Belt. Qin Sang secretly guessed that if humans existed in this realm, they wouldn't have missed such an advantageous environment; body cultivators should be numerous.</p><p>The "Great Dao" pursued by cultivators, at least before the Divine Transformation stage, could be likened to the Heavenly Dao; thus, cultivation should follow the Heavenly Dao.  Those who defy the heavens would only do so after possessing immense power.  How can one defy the heavens without understanding them?</p><p>For body cultivators, this was a treasure trove! Yet, considering the Abyssal Beasts, the situation was uncertain.  If this hidden danger couldn't be resolved, cultivators of any kind – humans, demons, ghosts, or spirits – would surely be unwilling to pay the price of mental derangement for powerful strength.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang summoned the Sky Eye Butterfly and the Fire Jade Centipede.  The two spirit insects also showed some unease at the start of their cultivation.</p><p>Spirit insects cultivated divine abilities, not like Qin Sang's uncontrolled true essence; however, inhaling the chaotic energy would still have an impact, especially on their minds.  Since they were not yet sentient, if they were infected with violent intent, the consequences would be dire.  Qin Sang didn't dare let them continue their cultivation for now.</p><p>"I thought the rich spiritual energy here would give you a good chance of breaking through without the Frost Jade Pill, but we must wait..." Qin Sang gently soothed the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly slowly fluttered its wings, conveying affection, showing no impatience.</p><p>Qin Sang was like a newborn, slowly exploring this world. He had discovered the benefits of the chaotic world but didn't allow the chaotic energy to temper his body because he didn't know if hidden dangers existed. The power of the celestial bodies and the Dragon Transformation Pond were sufficient to support his cultivation, and the speed wouldn’t be too slow.</p><p>Twelve years later.</p><p>A Daoist emerged from the mist-shrouded valley. Qin Sang's aura was considerably stronger than twelve years ago, thanks to the improvement of his physical body.  In his eagerness to interact with the outside world, he had consumed the Dragon Transformation Pond's spiritual liquid without restraint during those twelve years. Coupled with his previous foundation acquired at the Radiant Gold Sword Grotto and other places, he finally broke through to the late fourth stage of *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*!</p><p>Gazing at the sky, Qin Sang thought to himself, a late Nascent Soul cultivator wouldn't be considered weak anywhere; his physical body alone could handle most situations.  The Sky Eye Butterfly compensated for his sensory shortcomings. If there was real danger, he could forcibly use his true essence and deploy treasure abilities. True essence chaos didn't occur instantly, it simply meant he couldn't directly replenish it from the heavens; he'd have to escape before his true essence was exhausted.</p><p>With a step, Qin Sang flashed towards the island's center, reappearing above it, holding a spirit stone. He'd obtained it from a beast demon's lair.  Unsurprisingly, the spirit stone's energy was also chaotic. He had already learned from the island's monsters that there were no transformed great demons nearby, and they hadn’t ventured further.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that while drifting at sea, the Sky Eye Butterfly had spotted a distant land during an alert, seeming extremely vast – even if not a continent, it was far larger than this island. He leaped into the air, flying towards the location he remembered.</p><p>A recommendation for a friend's book; interested cultivators might check it out and show your support.</p><p>*Cling On!
