<h1>Chapter 405: The Chubby Chick</h1><p>Ever since he started cultivating the *Yuanshen Sword Raising Chapter*, Qin Sang's sole focus had been gathering enough spiritwood to satisfy the insatiable demands of the Ebony Sword.  He never dared to hope for anything more.</p><p>The secrets revealed by Wandering Cloud were like legends to him.</p><p>The Ten Sacred Spiritwoods were, indeed, the stuff of legends, certainly not something a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator like him could even dream of possessing.  Perhaps after reaching Golden Core, he might dare to entertain such thoughts.</p><p>Yet, fate had a strange way of unfolding. Here, before his very eyes, lay a piece of a Sacred Spiritwood!</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the Bloodwood with an obsessive glint in his eyes.  Sensing the potent aura emanating from the Eternal Bloodwood, only one phrase came to mind – truly worthy of its reputation!</p><p>This piece of Eternal Bloodwood was clearly unrefined.</p><p>If the Ebony Sword could absorb it, there was no doubt it would undergo a complete transformation, ascending to the rank of a true magical treasure and gaining a formidable supernatural ability.</p><p>Suppressing his eagerness, Qin Sang tore his gaze away from the Eternal Bloodwood and turned towards the other half of the jade pool.</p><p>He saw a delicate, white root growing amidst the magma-like, crimson 'water'.  The slender root was as white as jade, clearly no ordinary thing. However, its stem and leaves were missing, leaving only the main root standing solitary in the pool, its severed end bearing clear bite marks!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. After a moment of contemplation, he took a step forward, then suddenly sensed something and abruptly looked up at the sphere of lightning.</p><p>Just then, he saw the lightning within surge, several tiny bolts breaking free from their confinement!</p><p>Upon escaping the sphere, the hair-thin lightning bolts instantly expanded to the thickness of a man's arm.  Amidst deafening thunder, they slammed down towards Qin Sang's hiding place.</p><p>The cavern trembled, the lightning blinding.</p><p>As if anticipating the attack, Qin Sang pushed off the ground with force, leaping backward.</p><p>However, as he moved, a gust of wind erupted from his right. In his peripheral vision, he caught sight of a silver, round shape hurtling towards him, moving like a bolt of lightning, eerily familiar.</p><p>Thunder Escape!</p><p>Qin Sang instantly recalled the scene he had witnessed earlier, the Thunder Swallow using Thunder Escape to force the black-robed man out of hiding with its physical body alone.</p><p>He thought, “Just as I suspected!”</p><p>Seeing the jade pool, the sphere of lightning, and the white fragments within, he had felt the arrangement was peculiar, like a nest nurturing something.  Coupled with the gnawed remains of the unknown spiritual herb, Qin Sang was almost certain that a Thunder Swallow chick was hidden within the cavern!</p><p>He already knew that the Thunder Swallow's Thunder Eyes could see through invisibility.</p><p>It made sense now why the Thunder Swallow fought so desperately against two Nascent Soul experts – it was protecting its young.  The remaining fragments in the sphere of lightning suggested the chick had likely just hatched, which is why Qin Sang wasn't overly afraid.</p><p>What he hadn't anticipated was the chick's ability to control the lightning within the sphere, and its power far exceeded his expectations!</p><p>"Rise!"</p><p>Having just dodged the sphere's initial attack, Qin Sang had exhausted his momentum and couldn't evade further. He had no choice but to face it head-on.</p><p>With a roar, he activated the Ten Yama Formation he had prepared earlier.</p><p>Facing the Thunder Swallow's Thunder Escape, he dared not hold back. The black-robed man's fate was fresh in his mind. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator couldn't withstand the power of Thunder Escape and had been put in grave danger.</p><p>The formation had barely unfolded, its banners shielding Qin Sang, when the Thunder Swallow, using Thunder Escape, crashed into it, barely held at bay.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Yin energy of the Ten Yama Formation collided with the Thunder Escape, each force attempting to devour the other. The formation showed signs of collapsing.</p><p>Within the formation, the ghost banners fluttered wildly, their surfaces rippling.</p><p>The main spirit roared, its voice shaking the cavern, struggling to resist the impact of Thunder Escape.</p><p>Qin Sang groaned, his blood churning. He staggered back several steps before regaining his footing, hastily stabilizing the formation, inwardly shocked.</p><p>As the residual energy dissipated, Qin Sang remained hidden within the Ten Yama Formation, peering through the gaps in the Yin energy. He saw a falcon standing on one leg at the edge of the jade pool.</p><p>This falcon wasn't exactly majestic. It looked more like a chubby chick.</p><p>Its feathers lacked luster, replaced by clumps of pale yellow down, including its small, pointed beak.  It held a small piece of white eggshell in its mouth.</p><p>The chick's downy feathers were puffed out, its fluffy body resembling a yellow ball, looking anything but fearsome, rather, quite adorable.</p><p>*Crack, crack…*</p><p>Its little beak moved.</p><p>The crisp sound of chewing echoed through the cavern. The eggshell, unharmed within the sphere of lightning, was incredibly fragile in the chick's beak, easily crushed.</p><p>*Cheep, cheep…*</p><p>The chick chewed on the eggshell, then suddenly widened its eyes, gripping the edge of the pool with its talons, letting out a sharp chirp.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly as he braced himself.  He then saw it turn its head and take a sip from the spirit spring behind it. Then, craning its neck, it hopped and flapped its small, disproportionately sized wings with effort.</p><p>Its throat pulsed as it swallowed the eggshell and spring water, its chirps becoming noticeably more cheerful.</p><p>Qin Sang stared, dumbfounded. Had it choked?</p><p>Washing down its meal with spirit spring water was certainly extravagant.</p><p>After swallowing the eggshell, the chick seemed content, tilting its small head, its round eyes filled with a mixture of innocence and curiosity as it openly studied Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had a feeling it was looking at him as a plaything.</p><p>Seeing its憨态可掬 appearance, who would imagine it would eventually grow into a majestic Thunder Swallow, capable of battling two Nascent Soul cultivators with such power?</p><p>Qin Sang's lips twitched. So this was what a Thunder Swallow chick looked like!</p><p>It was clearly newly hatched.</p><p>Another person might have been completely charmed by the chick's large, innocent eyes, but Qin Sang didn't find it cute at all. Instead, he felt a sense of dread.</p><p>Despite having just hatched, this chick possessed the peak cultivation of a Demon Spirit, no weaker than Yu Hua!</p><p>This was normal. Powerful demon beasts were blessed by the heavens, born with terrifying strength.</p><p>Moreover, the spiritual herb planted in the cavern by the Thunder Swallow was undoubtedly extraordinary, likely carefully prepared for its young. It wasn't surprising that the chick, after consuming the herb, had broken through to the peak of the Demon Spirit realm.</p><p>The peak Demon Spirit realm wasn't inherently terrifying, as the chick was clearly still very young. Its true combat ability didn't necessarily reflect its full potential.</p><p>The truly terrifying aspect was its ability to manipulate the power of the sphere of lightning!</p><p>The sphere was undoubtedly left behind by the adult Thunder Swallow to incubate and protect its young. With the chick controlling it, even Golden Core cultivators had to be cautious.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted past the chick, landing on the Eternal Bloodwood lying in the spirit spring.</p><p>He clenched his hands. The demonic fire within his Crimson Pill was almost halfway consumed. He didn't have much time left. He had to leave before the fire burned out completely, or he would be trapped in the cavern forever.</p><p>He wondered what the adult Thunder Swallow would do upon returning and finding him there.</p><p>Whether he became the chick's food or its toy, neither prospect was appealing to Qin Sang.</p>
