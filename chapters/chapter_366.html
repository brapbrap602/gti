<h1>Chapter 359: The Dao Lineage</h1><p>“From now on, you don’t need to keep your Great-Grandmaster’s memorial tablet…”</p><p>Qin Sang lightly shook Yun Youzi’s spirit tablet.</p><p>Li Yu Fu was initially puzzled, then suddenly realized something, his face filled with shock.  “Great-Grandmaster…could it be…?”</p><p>Li Yu Fu had been holding back from asking, but he clearly remembered his master mentioning more than once that Grand-Uncle Qin Sang was only a couple of years older than him.</p><p>He’s now over seventy, yet he looks as young as a boy.</p><p>Only one possibility remained.</p><p>His Grand-Uncle had truly become a celestial being.</p><p>But Li Yu Fu never imagined that the Great-Grandmaster was also a celestial being!</p><p>Neither his master nor his grandmaster had ever mentioned this, perhaps they didn’t know either.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded, making a joke, “I didn’t expect that Senior Yun Youzi would enter the immortal path even before me.  A few years ago, I unexpectedly met the senior and recognized him thanks to having seen his portrait before. The old man is doing very well now; putting up a memorial tablet for him isn’t akin to cursing him, is it?”</p><p>Li Yu Fu respectfully put away the tablet, still finding it hard to believe that the Qingyang lineage, including Qin Sang, only six people in total, had produced two cultivators.</p><p>“So, Great-Grandmaster, like Grand-Uncle, also became a celestial being…”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and explained further, “I dare not claim to be a celestial being. We can only be considered cultivators, those who wield great power…Senior Yun Youzi's journey was much more arduous. He entered the path at seventy-eight, established his foundation at a hundred years old. To achieve this feat is unparalleled in the cultivation world; it stemmed from his unwavering belief. Although Daoist Jixin and Mingyue are mortals, their enshrinement and veneration by countless people is also due to the senior's teachings. I only hope that you, future generations, will never forget…”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu bowed solemnly, “Disciple will heed Grand-Uncle’s teachings.”</p><p>Jing Tian quickly followed suit.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the master and disciple, nodding silently in his heart. Li Yu Fu was not only intelligent but also of good character.</p><p>Although he stayed in the Ancestor Hall, his spiritual sense had always enveloped the Qingyang Hall, silently observing Li Yu Fu and his disciple.</p><p>For the entire day, Qin Sang had a sense of deja vu.</p><p>Those who came to Qingyang Hall for treatment were all local villagers. No one looked down on Li Yu Fu because of his young age; everyone treated him with great respect.</p><p>Li Yu Fu and his disciple treated everyone equally, regardless of wealth or poverty.</p><p>If a patient couldn’t afford the consultation fee and chose to settle the account later, Li Yu Fu showed no impatience. His ledger, though not as thick as Daoist Jixin’s, had also accumulated a considerable amount.</p><p>All his actions were genuine and natural.</p><p>Without the teachings of Daoist Jixin and Mingyue, it would have been impossible to achieve this.</p><p>If it were an act, it wouldn't have escaped Qin Sang’s keen observation. Even if Li Yu Fu were cunning, it would have been impossible for a young child like Jing Tian to maintain such a perfect pretense.</p><p>Daoist Jixin and Mingyue had worthy successors!</p><p>Qin Sang was very pleased.</p><p>At the same time, he perceived a look of anticipation and anxiety in the depths of Li Yu Fu and Jing Tian’s eyes when they looked at him.</p><p>He was very familiar with this gaze.</p><p>Before he came into contact with the cultivation world, he used to look at cultivators with such eyes.</p><p>“Extend your hands, let me see your aptitude…” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Qin Sang was grateful to Daoist Jixin and Mingyue. If Li Yu Fu and his disciple possessed talent, he would naturally not mind helping them.</p><p>However, Qin Sang knew very well that this possibility was extremely small.  Even among the descendants of the three great families in the capital, none possessed spiritual roots—this was the norm.</p><p>Li Yu Fu’s face lit up, and he quickly extended his arm. Jing Tian was still a bit bewildered, but he also knew it must be something good.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Qin Sang placed his fingers on Li Yu Fu’s wrist, letting out a soft exclamation, and looked at Li Yu Fu in surprise. Then, he placed his fingers on Jing Tian’s wrist, examined it, and fell into thought.</p><p>The master and disciple did not dare to disturb him, watching Qin Sang nervously.</p><p>It was indeed unexpected. Qin Sang hadn’t expected Li Yu Fu to possess spiritual roots, and moreover, an exceptional dual-attribute (water and wood) spiritual root!</p><p>Comparable to Senior Sister Shi Hong!</p><p>Unfortunately, Jing Tian had no spiritual roots and couldn't cultivate.</p><p>While checking their aptitudes, Qin Sang also checked Li Yu Fu’s bone age: twenty-five years old.</p><p>At this age, starting his cultivation journey seemed a bit late, but with his dual-attribute spiritual roots, if he diligently cultivated without taking detours, he still had a chance to establish his foundation.</p><p>Qin Sang, using his influence, was confident in getting Li Yu Fu admitted to Mount Shaohua.</p><p>However, firstly, Qin Sang is still struggling at the Foundation Establishment stage, busy traveling and with limited time, making personal guidance impossible.  She can only ensure he can cultivate peacefully within his sect and avoid bullying.</p><p>Secondly, tracing back their origins, Li Yu Fu and Yun You Zi have a clear master-disciple relationship.  Directly bringing Li Yu Fu to Shao Hua Mountain would seem presumptuous.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Yun You Zi's comment about Tan Hao's deep brotherhood at Yin Shan Pass; his tone seemed to hint at something else, perhaps remembering Ji Xin Dao Zhang and considering taking on a disciple?</p><p>If Yun You Zi truly wishes to take a disciple, Li Yu Fu would be the perfect candidate!</p><p>This thought struck Qin Sang, prompting a decision.</p><p>She asked Li Yu Fu to let Jing Tian rest, then revealed the truth.</p><p>Li Yu Fu's delight was evident, but a hint of worry clouded his eyes. He couldn't help but ask, "Master Aunt, can Jing Tian really not cultivate alongside me?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Without spiritual roots, he cannot cultivate. This is the cruelty of Heaven's way."</p><p>Li Yu Fu felt a mix of joy and sorrow.  Hearing that Qin Sang wouldn't take him as a disciple was a great disappointment.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "I'll leave you a cultivation technique and some protective artifacts.  Stay at Cui Ming Mountain and cultivate. After I speak with Elder Yun You Zi, if he's willing to guide you, he'll take you to his sect. Elder Yun You Zi's sect, Tai Yi Dan Zong, is a leading righteous sect, the strongest in the cultivation world.  Being accepted into Tai Yi Dan Zong would be your greatest fortune…"</p><p>Before the sixth level of Qi Condensation, the demand for spiritual energy isn't that strict.</p><p>Cui Ming Mountain is a spiritually rich place, gathering spiritual energy, with excellent feng shui, entirely sufficient for Li Yu Fu's cultivation needs.</p><p>"However…"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone shifted, becoming serious. "Before that, I have one request. You must fulfill it."</p><p>Li Yu Fu's expression tightened. "Please instruct me, Master Aunt."</p><p>Qin Sang was pleased with Li Yu Fu's attitude, nodding. "Entering the path of cultivation means severing worldly ties. Before your cultivation begins, you must continue the legacy of Qing Yang Temple. This is your unavoidable responsibility. Jing Tian has a good nature; remember to guide him well, don't let this worldly lineage die out."</p><p>The Qing Yang Temple lineage, beginning with Yun You Zi, was truly developed by Ji Xin Dao Zhang, incorporating the life's work of Ji Xin Dao Zhang and Ming Yue over the years.</p><p>To sever the legacy would be a great pity!</p>
