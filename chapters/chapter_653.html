<h1>Chapter 645: The Fat Silkworm</h1><p>The Cai Huan Giant Earthworm always emerges from the mud.</p><p>It feeds on toxic gas, and before it refines it, a ring of poisonous miasma forms on its body, making it look like it has expanded countless times, comparable to a giant python.</p><p>The poisonous miasma is composed of pure toxic gas, surpassing even the poisonous fog of the swamp.</p><p>Whenever the Cai Huan Giant Earthworm appears, it's easily spotted.</p><p>Within the poisonous fog, Qin Sang wasn't sure how far the Red Fire Gilded Gold scent could spread. He considered circling the core of the poisonous swamp and choosing several locations.</p><p>The poisonous fog moved like water.</p><p>Qin Sang covered his mouth and nose, his gaze scanning back and forth.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly narrowed, fixing on the base of a large tree, a gleam of joy flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang had applied Red Fire Gilded Gold to the tree trunk.</p><p>At this moment, a patch of grass growing at the base of the tree was swaying, clearly not caused by the wind, but by the disturbance of the roots, transmitting the force upwards.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, deciding not to directly use his spiritual sense to investigate. He decided to wait for the Cai Huan Giant Earthworm to appear, determine its rank, and then take action, lest he should fail through cleverness.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The grass swayed more and more violently.</p><p>Gradually, the grass parted, mud surging up, and then a seven-colored, plump, fat worm awkwardly crawled out.</p><p>This worm was incredibly plump, almost a small column of flesh, its whole body seemed to be draped in a layer of iridescent light, like a colorful silkworm. Its body, like a fat man's belly, was segmented, and every wriggle sent a ripple of flesh.</p><p>Crawling from the mud to the slippery grass stalks was difficult for it.</p><p>Like a mortal struggling after falling into water, it rose and fell, stirring the mud to gurgle and bubble, finally clinging to two grass stalks before crawling out of the mud, then heading straight for the tree trunk.</p><p>Probably the Red Fire Gilded Gold's attraction was too great; the fat silkworm's movements were much more agile than before, its climbing speed surprisingly fast.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the fat silkworm with suspicion.</p><p>Especially when the fat silkworm scurried up the tree trunk and eagerly licked the Red Fire Gilded Gold, Qin Sang was even more baffled and confused.</p><p>This clearly wasn't the Cai Huan Giant Earthworm.</p><p>But Qin Sang couldn't find a matching insect name.</p><p>Neither the Witch Insect List nor the Strange Insect List contained it!</p><p>After seeing the fat silkworm, Qin Sang thought it wasn't a spirit insect, just an ordinary insect that had accidentally appeared here.</p><p>But seeing it rush towards the Red Fire Gilded Gold, Qin Sang immediately overturned his previous guess. This was definitely a spirit insect, but one without any record!</p><p>On the Witch Insect List, there were numerous silkworm-type spirit insects, but all had distinct characteristics.  Including the legendary Witch God's insect, the nine-transforming immortal silkworm, the Witch tribe also had records.</p><p>But there wasn't the slightest resemblance to this fat worm.</p><p>None had such chaotic colors.</p><p>Moreover, besides the color, the fat silkworm seemed unremarkable.</p><p>It possessed no power whatsoever, essentially a common insect. Qin Sang couldn’t determine its transformation stage, even doubting whether it was a spirit insect at all.</p><p>But the scene before him left Qin Sang no choice but to believe.</p><p>The fat silkworm happily licked the Red Fire Gilded Gold, its plump body swaying from side to side, giving a feeling of great contentment.</p><p>The amount of Red Fire Gilded Gold was small. After licking it clean, the fat silkworm let go of the tree trunk, ‘plop’ dropped into the mud, turned over, and continued to wriggle, heading towards other areas smeared with Red Fire Gilded Gold, feasting heartily.</p><p>The Red Fire Gilded Gold's allure to it was so great, it must be a spirit insect, just one unseen by the Witch tribe and human races, or one that existed in ancient times but went extinct, its records lost along with it.</p><p>The Cai Huan Giant Earthworm had a strong territorial sense.</p><p>If the fat silkworm was a spirit insect, it meant the Cai Huan Giant Earthworm had left the swamp.</p><p>This seemingly clumsy fat silkworm couldn't possibly have the strength to drive away the Cai Huan Giant Earthworm, could it? Did the Cai Huan Giant Earthworm migrate on its own, or is this creature actually very strong?</p><p>Qin Sang grew serious. Years of experience told him that spirit insects, like people, couldn’t be judged by appearances.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang quietly opened his pouch and summoned a corpse puppet.</p><p>The corpse puppet leaped from the tree trunk, walking through the mud. The corpse aura on it was obvious as it approached the fat silkworm.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Fat Silkworm ignored her completely, its head not turning as it greedily lapped up the Red Fire Gilded substance on the grass stalk, until the Corpse Cultivator grabbed it by its rear and lifted it into the air.</p><p>The Corpse Cultivator turned, innocently holding up the Fat Silkworm towards Qin Sang's hiding place.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm struggled in the Corpse Cultivator's hand, its upper body reaching towards the Red Fire Gilded substance, but it couldn't break free from the Corpse Cultivator's powerful grip.  It bit down hard on the Corpse Cultivator's iron fingers, leaving not a single mark.</p><p>Some liquid, possibly saliva, landed on the Corpse Cultivator's finger. It seemed to be poisonous, but the toxicity was too low; the Corpse Cultivator's corpse energy easily resisted it.</p><p>It seemed truly out of tricks, but not giving up hope, it stretched its plump body, trying to reach the Red Fire Gilded substance.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was speechless.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang emerged from the shadows, swiftly approaching and using her true energy to grab the Fat Silkworm. After examining it for a while, Qin Sang was certain: the Fat Silkworm wasn't pretending; it was just that weak!</p><p>"What on earth is this thing?!"</p><p>Qin Sang was exasperated, thinking to herself that she was truly having terrible luck.</p><p>Wasting the Red Fire Gilded substance and so much time, she'd first caught an excessively strong Gloomy Water Bug, then this useless Fat Silkworm. Even newborn spirit insects weren't this pathetic.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Fat Silkworm, letting it lick up the surrounding Red Fire Gilded substance. Only then did it calm down, immediately falling asleep on Qin Sang's finger.</p><p>It wasn't like molting; it was just… full.</p><p>After consuming her Red Fire Gilded substance, it dared to sleep soundly on her hand.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to throw it away, but considering that it was an unrecorded spirit insect in the Witch Insect Catalogue, and that despite its weakness, it occupied the Rainbow Ring Earthworm's nest and lived in this terrifying poisonous swamp, she hesitated.</p><p>This area, besides the poisonous fog, was also home to many venomous beasts, a truly dangerous place.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang put it in her insect basket, planning to check the Witch Clan's texts later to find out its origins.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm had disrupted her arrangements in this area.  Qin Sang covered the insect basket and looked around.</p><p>"The Rainbow Ring Earthworm has left the swamp?"</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled and unwilling to give up so easily, so she set up bait in three other directions around the swamp's core, continuing to lure it.</p><p>In the end, the Rainbow Ring Earthworm didn't appear. It was truly gone.</p><p>All this effort, only to obtain a useless Fat Silkworm.</p><p>Without knowing the Fat Silkworm's background, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't choose it as her life-bound insect, at most using the Imperial Spirit Sect's secret techniques to control it during its molting stage.</p><p>Judging by its current stupidity, its future didn't look bright.</p><p>Another wasted trip!</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled wryly, suppressing her frustration and heading to the next location.</p>
