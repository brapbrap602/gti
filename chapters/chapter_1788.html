<h1>Chapter 1779: A Visit</h1><p>Inside the hall.</p><p>Master Qi and a red-faced elder clad in a Daoist robe embroidered with lightning runes sat facing each other.</p><p>The two had known each other for a long time.</p><p>Master Qi got straight to the point, “This humble Daoist has come to ask Elder Li for a favor.”</p><p>The red-faced elder laughed heartily, “This old Daoist just told my attendant that Master Qi must have a reason for visiting!”</p><p>Master Qi’s face showed a hint of embarrassment.</p><p>The red-faced elder only teased his old friend a little before turning serious, “Fellow Daoist, what is the matter? Speak freely. Does it have something to do with this young friend?”</p><p>As he spoke, the red-faced elder looked at the young Daoist respectfully standing behind Master Qi.</p><p>He knew almost all of Master Qi’s disciples and attendants, but he had never seen this person before.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the young Daoist was Qin Sang, disguised as Mingyue Daolang’s disciple, accompanying Master Qi.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Li,” Qin Sang bowed respectfully.</p><p>This Elder Li was an elder of the Right Thunder Palace.</p><p>Master Qi nodded, “I can’t hide anything from your discerning eyes. He is the disciple of an old friend of mine. As you can probably tell, this young man’s cultivation has reached the Great Completion of the Earthly Immortal Realm and wishes to break through, but he has yet to receive his second-stage Dharma Seal.”</p><p>Elder Li had already guessed as much and was not surprised. He said amiably, “I wonder which year this young friend received his Dharma Seal? Those who receive their Dharma Seal in our Right Thunder Palace demonstrate a karmic connection with our sect. Even if they are not disciples of our sect, as long as they haven’t done anything detrimental to the sect, the sect won’t make things difficult for them during their ascension and empowerment.”</p><p>He scrutinized Qin Sang with his gaze.</p><p>“He is not a disciple of the Right Thunder Palace, otherwise why would I trouble you?” Master Qi shook his head.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Elder Li pondered, “I wonder what his initial Dharma Seal was? Fellow Daoist should know that our sect’s High Divine Empyrean Scripture has a long and profound history. It is not comparable to ordinary Dharma Seals. Even if they are both Thunder Dharma Seals, they may not be able to ascend to our sect’s Dharma Seal. Only a few are barely compatible.”</p><p>Master Qi said meaningfully, “His initial Dharma Seal is indeed the High Divine Empyrean Scripture.”</p><p>Elder Li was slightly taken aback, then immediately understood.</p><p>In Ju Shan Zhi, besides the Right Thunder Palace, only the Left Thunder Palace could bestow the High Divine Empyrean Scripture.</p><p>This young man was a disciple of the Left Thunder Palace, yet he wanted to ascend in the Right Thunder Palace. There was only one possibility: this young man, or his sect, had offended the Left Thunder Palace.</p><p>Elder Li couldn’t help but hesitate.</p><p>The Right Thunder Palace and the Left Thunder Palace were not on good terms, and he was happy to cause some trouble for the Left Thunder Palace. But if this young man's master had a deep grudge against the Left Thunder Palace, helping this young man would trigger an open conflict between the two sects, which was not what the sect wanted to see.</p><p>Master Qi said in a deep voice, “Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, this young man does not carry any major karmic debts. If any disputes arise, this humble Daoist will bear full responsibility.”</p><p>Elder Li nodded slightly. He could still trust this old friend.</p><p>To be able to move Master Qi to action, this young man’s background was worth pondering.</p><p>Master Qi was a renowned Artifact Refinement Master of Star Island’s Immortal Lake. Many factions had tried to recruit him when he was still gaining fame, but Master Qi had his own pride and declined all offers. It was rare to see him asking for favors.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Elder Li took out a Thunder Talisman, “Young friend, remember, on the day of the empowerment two years from now, bring this talisman to our sect.”</p><p>“Thank you, Fellow Daoist, for your accommodation.”</p><p>Master Qi cupped his hands.</p><p>Qin Sang took the Thunder Talisman and noticed that it was similar to the Left Thunder Palace's, with subtle differences, and also expressed his gratitude repeatedly.</p><p>Master Qi and Elder Li chatted for a while longer before getting up to leave.</p><p>Returning to Pot City, Qin Sang bid farewell to Master Qi, but was stopped, “When your master finishes his seclusion, tell him that this humble Daoist has something to discuss with him.”</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly surprised and agreed.</p><p>He wondered what Master Qi wanted from him.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for a few more days. When he went to see Master Qi again, disguised, he was directly led to the fire chamber by an attendant.  He saw Master Qi sitting in the fire chamber, unconcerned with his appearance.</p><p>Fragments of a True Treasure were placed in front of him, surrounded by a chaotic pile of spirit materials.</p><p>Most of these spirit materials were worldly treasures.  If an ordinary person saw this scene, they would be dumbfounded and breathless.</p><p>Master Qi’s hair was a mess. If it weren't for the self-cleaning ability of his Daoist robe, he would probably look even more disheveled.</p><p>He stared at the scroll, scratching his head from time to time, as if pondering some question, but constantly rejecting his own ideas.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Wrong!”</p><p>“That’s it, it should be like this! But…”</p><p>Master Qi was immersed in his own world, completely oblivious to Qin Sang at the door.</p><p>Qin Sang coughed lightly.</p><p>Master Qi was startled awake, looked up, his eyes still somewhat dazed as his consciousness gradually returned, “Oh! It’s Fellow Daoist Mingyue, please sit!”</p><p>He patted the non-existent dust on his body, put away the miscellaneous items, took out two meditation mats, and eagerly welcomed Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sat opposite him, glancing at the scroll, “Master summoned me so urgently, have you had new insights?”</p><p>Only the True Treasure fragments could make Master Qi so engrossed.</p><p>Master Qi, however, asked in return, “I recall Fellow Daoist recently acquired a set of spirit armor?”</p><p>“Indeed, it’s this armor.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. With a thought, the Returning Wind Armor covered his body. His eyes peered through the faceplate, curiously looking at Master Qi, guessing his intentions.</p><p>Master Qi gazed at the Returning Wind Armor for a moment, nodded slightly, and showed a rare look of hesitation, “After contemplating the True Treasure fragments for many days, this humble Daoist has had an idea, but I'm not entirely confident. This treasure belongs to Fellow Daoist, so I must discuss it with you first…”</p><p>“Master, please speak freely,” Qin Sang said readily.</p><p>Master Qi then laid out his thoughts.</p><p>After hearing him, Qin Sang couldn't help but be surprised. Master Qi had actually thought of a way to refine the True Treasure fragments.</p><p>Not to repair them.  Master Qi admitted that even if his cultivation advanced further, he wouldn't be able to repair the True Treasure.</p><p>The method he thought of was to fuse the True Treasure fragments into another magical treasure.</p><p>It was impossible to completely merge the two treasures, but it was possible to connect their auras. With luck, it might be possible to activate some of the True Treasure fragment's power, thereby greatly enhancing the other treasure.</p><p>However, no one knew how much power the True Treasure fragment still retained.</p><p>Moreover, Master Qi wasn’t very confident.</p><p>If it failed, the magical treasure would certainly be lost, and the True Treasure fragment might also be damaged, making things worse.</p><p>Pseudo-Spiritual Treasures were too precious. If he failed, the loss would be heavy. Qin Sang's Returning Wind Armor was considered top-tier among magical treasures, making it the most suitable.</p><p>“Based on my judgment, this True Treasure was likely a defensive True Treasure when it was intact. If Fellow Daoist agrees, this humble Daoist will use the Returning Wind Armor as a base, supplemented by certain spirit materials, to refine a new set of top-grade spirit armor, striving for better compatibility with the True Treasure fragments…”</p><p>Master Qi looked at Qin Sang with some nervousness.</p><p>After all, Qin Sang was the owner of the True Treasure fragments. He worried that Qin Sang would take back the fragments and turn to the Daoist Sect's Artifact Refinement Masters.</p><p>Master Qi admitted that he couldn't compare to the true experts of the Daoist Sect. He could only promise to do his utmost to preserve the True Treasure fragments.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the True Treasure fragments. He didn't think for too long before giving Master Qi a joyful answer, telling him to proceed as he saw fit!</p><p>However, Qin Sang made a request, “Master, when refining this treasure, could you allow me to control the fire for you?”</p><p>He said "control the fire," but in reality, he wanted to observe the refinement process.</p><p>Qin Sang considered that, firstly, it wasn’t easy to invite a Daoist Sect expert, and secondly, the Daoist Sect, being a large and influential organization, had probably seen intact True Treasures and might not be as invested. Even if they agreed, they wouldn’t likely allow him to observe.</p><p>The True Treasure fragments were a pleasant surprise. Failure would only mean losing a set of spirit armor, which he could afford.</p><p>Success would result in a set of spirit armor far exceeding the power of ordinary magical treasures, plus invaluable Artifact Refinement experience.</p><p>This time, Master Qi would definitely use all his skills. Qin Sang would effectively become half a true disciple of Master Qi.</p><p>Master Qi was overjoyed, “Thank you for your trust, Fellow Daoist! I need to think this through carefully before I begin. Please stay here for a few more years, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn’t be leaving Star Island’s Immortal Lake before receiving the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Dharma Seal. He immediately retrieved the imprint within the Returning Wind Armor, restoring the treasure to its original form, and handed it to Master Qi.</p><p>The Returning Wind Armor's main body was a set of bronze armor no bigger than a palm.</p><p>Master Qi carefully put it away and discussed the Dao of Artifact Refinement with Qin Sang.</p><p>Leaving Master Qi’s residence, Qin Sang’s next task was simple: to continuously cultivate his spirit and wait for the Right Thunder Palace’s empowerment ceremony.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang ceased his spirit cultivation technique and wondered if he should visit Sword Heart Island.</p><p>The time he had agreed upon with Realman Zhijian had already passed. Now that he had received his initial Dharma Seal, and his second-stage Dharma Seal was within reach, he should consider how to ascend to the third-stage Dharma Seal.</p><p>The third-stage Dharma Seal of the High Divine Empyrean Scripture was called the Five Thunders Secret Scripture.</p><p>As far as he knew, the ancestral altars of the Left and Right Thunder Palaces didn't bestow the Five Thunders Secret Scripture.  According to Realman Zhijian, it was very likely not that they didn't bestow it to outsiders, but that they simply couldn't.</p><p>“It’s time to visit Realman Zhijian.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang flew out of Pot Island, heading north. Two days later, he entered a relatively open area of water.</p><p>In the center of this area was a small, circular island.</p><p>The island was covered in a type of spiritual tree called Sword Heart Orchid, from which the island derived its name.</p><p>From afar, Qin Sang saw the Sword Heart Orchids on the island, like sharp swords pointing towards the sky, standing straight and tall.</p><p>Before he got close, ripples suddenly appeared in the water, and a spirit sword made of water shot out, blocking Qin Sang's path, accompanied by a stern shout, “Halt!”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped his escape light and saw a slightly hunched black-robed elder fly out from Sword Heart Island.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the elder's eyes lit up, “Is this Daolang Qingfeng?”</p><p>“It is I. I have come to visit at Realman Zhijian's invitation. May I ask how I should address you, Fellow Daoist?” Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>The elder bowed deeply, “My master is in seclusion.  This old servant was ordered by my master to await Daolang Qingfeng.  I was blind just now, please forgive me, Daolang.”</p><p>Surprise flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>This elder was a late-Nascent Soul Grand Cultivator, yet he referred to himself as an "old servant," so humble.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn’t underestimate someone based on their status.</p><p>Learning from the elder that Realman Zhijian would be in seclusion for a while longer, Qin Sang stopped the elder from disturbing Realman Zhijian and settled down in a cave dwelling on Sword Heart Island.</p><p>Six months passed in a flash.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang felt the cave dwelling’s restrictions being triggered. He opened the door and first heard a hearty laugh.</p><p>Realman Zhijian entered with a smile on his face, walking quickly, “I’ve kept you waiting, Fellow Daoist… Eh?”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Realman Zhijian was first taken aback, then carefully examined him for a moment, “Since our last parting, Fellow Daoist seems to have greatly improved?”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that this person truly had a sharp eye.  He smiled without answering and invited him to sit.</p><p>Realman Zhijian sighed, “I previously heard Fellow Daoist Guzhou speak of you, saying that for decades, you’ve been in seclusion at Crane Cry Mountain, uninterested in worldly affairs.  Your unwavering determination is admirable. A few years ago, after this humble Daoist finished handling some trivial matters, I intended to visit you at Crane Cry Mountain.  I happened to receive your letter and thus waited in my cave dwelling, not daring to venture far until you arrived.”</p><p>“You are too kind, Fellow Daoist,” Qin Sang said with a questioning look, “Is there something you need?”</p><p>Realman Zhijian shook his head, “It’s just that this humble Daoist owes Fellow Daoist too many favors and has always felt uneasy. If there’s anything Fellow Daoist needs, please do not hesitate to ask!  Also, this humble Daoist would like to introduce you to a few experts, all fellow Daoists with compatible temperaments.  However, they are all recluses, and I fear they may not be worthy of your attention.”</p><p>Since they were friends of Realman Zhijian, their cultivation must be considerable. Qin Sang was naturally interested.</p><p>First, the tribulation, then receiving the Dharma Seal, Qin Sang had been busy with these two matters and hadn't properly interacted with the powerful cultivators of this world.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that there seemed to be more to Realman Zhijian's words, but since he didn’t elaborate, Qin Sang wouldn't take the initiative to ask.</p><p>After agreeing on a time to meet, Qin Sang changed the subject, “This humble Daoist does have something I wish to inquire about with you, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Realman Zhijian composed himself, ready to listen attentively.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully asked, “Could Fellow Daoist perhaps share the process of ascending to the third-stage Dharma Seal?”</p><p>He had already inquired and found that there was no so-called “Sword Dharma Seal.”</p><p>The Daoist Sect’s Dharma Seals corresponded to the Heavenly Court’s Celestial Deities, primarily the deities of the Thunder and Fighting Departments.</p><p>The Celestial Deities of the Fighting Department encompassed a wide range, for example, the Nine Luminary Star Lords could encompass the Five Elements and Yin Yang.</p><p>The Heavenly Court in Daoist legends didn’t have a position for a Sword God.</p><p>But Realman Zhijian didn't reveal a Dharma Altar when he wielded his sword, so Qin Sang still didn't know what kind of Dharma Seal Realman Zhijian cultivated.</p><p>Hearing this, Realman Zhijian was first surprised, then astonished.</p><p>“You’re not a Daoist Sect descendant?”</p><p>He had told Qin Sang that the third-stage Dharma Seal was bestowed by the Dao Court.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang seemed like a powerful cultivator concealing his strength, and he didn't appear panicked in the Ghostfang Kingdom.</p><p>If he were a Hollow Profound Realman of the Daoist Sect, it wouldn't be difficult to inquire about these secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Realman Zhijian repeatedly said, “No wonder,” and said seriously, “This humble Daoist received my third-stage Dharma Seal from the Dao Court!  Do you remember what this humble Daoist said in Star Valley?  I can tell you with certainty that in all of Ju Shan Zhi, I won't rule out the possibility of some sects hiding very deeply, but so far, this humble Daoist hasn’t discovered any sect whose ancestral altar can bestow the third-stage Dharma Seal!”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's last shred of hope was extinguished. It seemed he had to seek out the Dao Court.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hide his intentions, and Realman Zhijian naturally saw through them.  He explained in detail, “Within the Daoist Sect, one should distinguish between the Dao Court and the Daoist Temples.  If you have a karmic connection with a particular sect, it’s less difficult to obtain the qualification for empowerment. However, Daoist Temples only have their own inheritances, which may not be suitable for us.  Fellow Daoist should know that changing Dharma Seals midway, even if they are on the same path, inevitably carries the hidden danger of an unstable foundation.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood the implication and said in surprise, “Can the Dao Court truly integrate all Dharma Seals under Heaven?”</p><p>Realman Zhijian shook his head slightly, “Only the Dao Court Celestial Officials know! However, this humble Daoist did indeed obtain the desired third-stage Dharma Seal from the Dao Court. Even if I hadn’t, with the Dao Court’s capabilities, they could certainly find the most suitable third-stage Dharma Seal for you.  There’s no doubt about that!”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, once again sensing the Dao Court’s powerful control over this world.</p><p>“Obtaining the qualification for empowerment from the Dao Court is probably not easy, is it?”</p><p>Realman Zhijian’s tone was meaningful, “It is both difficult and not difficult.  It depends on whether Fellow Daoist is willing to add another layer of restriction upon yourself.”</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
