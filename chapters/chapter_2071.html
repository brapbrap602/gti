<h1>Chapter 2062: Mist Beasts</h1><p>The Mist Sea has a unique celestial phenomenon. When it occurs, thick fog rolls in like a tide, obscuring the sun and lasting for years. The Yi people call this period the "Fog Year."</p><p>The Fog Year is the most dangerous time in the Mist Sea.  Not only do fog cascades become much more frequent, but mist beasts appear in large groups, posing a significant threat to all life within the sea.</p><p>Therefore, when choosing a place to live, the Yi people prioritize avoiding areas prone to frequent fog cascades and mist beast appearances.</p><p>The Yi people also have ordinary people; not everyone can cultivate. They judge talent based on the amount of ancestral essence inherited. Only those with sufficient talent can comprehend supernatural powers and hope for a path of cultivation.</p><p>This step is called "Awakening." The vast majority of Yi people never awaken in their lifetime. Some may awaken, but too late, missing their prime, resulting in limited cultivation achievements.</p><p>Over the years, the Yi people have developed effective methods to cope with the Fog Year. They cultivate crops that can survive and even be harvested during this time.  Ordinary people stockpile enough supplies for a year before the Fog Year begins, remaining within a reasonable distance from their homes throughout the period. Aside from some limitations on life and travel, they generally manage quite well.</p><p>Once the Fog Year ends, the thick fog around their settlements dissipates, the sun shines, and life returns to normal, much like the lands beyond the Mist Sea.</p><p>Despite this, accidents can still happen, such as sudden fog cascades or mist beast attacks. These events are akin to natural disasters. The presence of cultivators offers protection; otherwise, it's a catastrophe.</p><p>During such times, the Yi people organize cultivators to patrol, allowing for early warnings and prevention.</p><p>The Mist Sea is undoubtedly a place of numerous calamities, but this very fact keeps outsiders away, ensuring peace for the Yi people.</p><p>Gu Ya had lived in the Mist Sea, but her knowledge was far less than Si Lu's. Everyone found Si Lu's account of the Mist Sea and its people quite fascinating.</p><p>Gu Ya sighed, "Had I known all this, so many of my companions wouldn't have been lost."</p><p>She realized that many methods existed to predict the arrival of fog cascades and mist beasts, though not entirely accurate, these could significantly reduce losses.</p><p>Cultivators from the Storm Realm also gradually learned some patterns—but at a heavy cost in blood!</p><p>"Daoist Si Lu, will the Fog Year affect our next actions?"</p><p>Qin Sang and others looked at Si Lu.</p><p>"Xia Changshi and I disappeared nearby. Those people haven't found us yet, and likely haven't given up searching. However, during the Fog Year, their patrol duties force them to withdraw most of their personnel. This works in our favor. We should leave this sea area first, then consider our next steps…"</p><p>Si Lu glanced outward. The mist flowed like water in the sky, creating various fantastical scenes. Using his enhanced vision, he saw hazy mountain silhouettes deep within the mist and detected no mist beasts or Si You Clan cultivators nearby. He then asked Qin Sang to summon their flying vessel, lifting everyone into the air to disappear into the mist.</p><p>Concerned about potential Si You Clan experts watching, they proceeded cautiously, concealing their vessel's aura and moving slowly as per Si Lu's directions.</p><p>The large array is located on an island.</p><p>The Mist Sea lacks the vast continents found in the Great Zhou.</p><p>The Si You Clan's royal family resides on the largest island. To cultivators from the Lesser Thousand World, this would seem like an expansive land.  The entire Si You Clan territory spreads outwards from this central island, with islands of varying sizes granted to different princes.</p><p>The tribes allied with the Si You Clan surround them, following a similar pattern elsewhere.</p><p>This doesn't imply free movement between these areas. First, not all places are safe habitats; second, even after the Fog Year, the mist may not dissipate in many areas. Some extremely dangerous places are avoided even by powerful Yi people, forming natural barriers.</p><p>It's even possible for territories of two clans to be very close yet never encounter each other.</p><p>Major clans use large teleportation arrays to travel between each other. Logically, they could reach the Si You Clan capital and then teleport to the Zhu Yan Clan. However, Si Lu worried that his enemies were watching that location, so he wouldn't dare approach the capital.</p><p>The Si You Clan's allied tribes lack teleportation arrays connecting to other places.</p><p>Therefore, to reach the Zhu Yan Clan, they must first escape the Si You Clan and its allied territories, then cross the border, reach other Yi Clan territories, and then travel to the Zhu Yan Clan.</p><p>The distance is unknown, but their previous teleportation saved considerable time, making it manageable.</p><p>The magic boat sped across the sea.  Guided by Silu, it constantly changed course, never detecting the presence of any Siyou tribe strongmen. The group gradually relaxed.</p><p>"It seems they've given up searching for you," Su Nu said.</p><p>"Perhaps."</p><p>Silu offered no opinion.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang, piloting the boat, frowned, his gaze deepening.</p><p>"Enemies?"</p><p>Su Nu noticed Qin Sang's change in expression and quickly asked.</p><p>Silu's expression tightened as well.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed the highest cultivation among them, aided by his celestial butterfly.  Neither Su Nu nor Silu had sensed anything amiss.</p><p>Qin Sang stared ahead, saying gravely, "The aura ahead is wrong. It's like a presence..."</p><p>He paused.</p><p>He sensed a distant presence that felt threatening, yet upon closer inspection, it felt strangely unlike a Siyou tribe strongman.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's description, Silu immediately reacted, "It could be a Mist Beast!"</p><p>"Mist Beast?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression grew serious.</p><p>Silu nodded. "I've heard of them. Our tribe has always avoided this sea area because of the frequent appearance of Mist Beasts, impossible to completely eliminate.  To think there's one powerful enough to threaten Daoist Qin... the rumors were true."</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang said, "Let's go see!"</p><p>He wanted to see what this Mist Beast looked like. Such powerful ones were rare.</p><p>The magic boat continued forward. Gradually, Su Nu and Silu also sensed the presence. Gu Ya and the others felt an oppressive force descend, making their hearts pound.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang stopped the boat. Everyone activated their spiritual sight, gazing ahead.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the fog ahead was unusually thin, not dispersed, but rather, being absorbed by a central mass of white fog.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>‘Crash! Crash!’</p><p>A storm raged.</p><p>They saw, amidst towering waves, an incredibly dense mass of fog drifting on the sea's surface, rapidly moving and continuously absorbing surrounding mist.</p><p>Inside the white fog, waves of mist churned, vaguely revealing strange outlines – like monstrous creatures. Some were huge, others the size of ordinary birds and beasts, sometimes surfacing, sometimes sinking into the fog.</p><p>They, like the fog, were pure white, as if composed of mist itself.</p><p>The largest was a gigantic serpent. When it occasionally raised its head, it resembled a large island; its arched back, a mountain range; its raised tail, a towering peak.</p><p>They only ever saw parts of the serpent's body, but it was clear its length was at least tens of thousands of feet.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly sensed it, then looked at Gu Ya.</p><p>Gu Ya trembled, "We've... never seen such a Mist Beast."</p><p>Terror filled her heart. This serpent Mist Beast was terrifying; its aura and oppressive force were comparable to a Transcendence cultivator.</p><p>The Mist Beasts encountered in the Storm World before were at most equivalent to Nascent Soul cultivators, and such encounters were few and far between, yet each time resulted in disastrous consequences.</p><p>The greatest threat wasn't the Changyou tribe at all! If a Mist Beast like this serpent appeared, it could easily annihilate the Storm World!</p><p>"Friend, don't worry. Such powerful Mist Beasts are extremely rare even in the Mist Sea…"</p><p>Silu noticed the hesitant expressions, quickly explaining, "Mist Beasts are linked to spiritual energy. Areas with more spiritual energy are more likely to produce powerful Mist Beasts; places with less spiritual energy are less dangerous. Those areas are mostly occupied by the superior tribes, who are responsible for eliminating them.  Our tribe usually doesn't encounter such Mist Beasts."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  So, even the selection of a tribe's territory considered their strength. Insufficient strength, occupying rich lands, only brought disaster. Conversely, declining tribes would voluntarily relinquish their territory and relocate.</p><p>This subtly resolved many conflicts within the various tribes.</p><p>"Will the Siyou tribe send someone to deal with this serpent?" Qin Sang looked around, seeing no one else.</p><p>"Not necessarily. They might not have discovered it yet, or they might observe for a while. Perhaps this Mist Beast will disappear on its own soon."</p><p>Silu explained.</p><p>While Mist Beasts were dangerous, they were also easily dealt with because they didn't exist for long; their lifespan was unpredictable, unrelated to their strength. The various tribes haven't yet discovered any patterns.</p><p>A dead Mist Beast left nothing behind. Aside from honing one's abilities, killing them offered no benefits. As long as it wasn't invading their tribe, they could simply avoid it and wait for it to dissipate.</p><p>"A rare opportunity. May I test the Mist Beast's abilities? Any objections?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Silu hesitated. "Mist Beasts are formless and intangible. Daoist Qin should ensure you leave no trace, then it should be fine."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "Please, fellow cultivators, provide cover!"</p><p>Before the words left her lips, everyone felt a sudden tightening in their chests, as if targeted by a terrifying presence.  A gigantic snake head rose from the swirling mist, its eyes empty sockets yet radiating ferocious intent.  A chill ran down their spines.</p><p>Suddenly, a sword beam sliced through the air, relieving the oppressive pressure.  Gu Ya and the others quickly steadied their minds.</p><p>Qin Sang soared into the air on her sword, charging towards the giant serpent. Su Nu and Si Lu simultaneously moved to the flanks, maintaining vigilance and concealing the fluctuations of the battle.</p><p>As they drew closer, the beast's aura became clearer—it was undeniably at the level of a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator! Other creatures lurked within the mist, but their strength was at most that of a Transformation Stage cultivator.</p><p>The serpent fixed its gaze on Qin Sang, its ferocity intensifying.  With a roar, its massive body burst forth from the mist, instantly obscuring half the sky.  Its slightest movement stirred the very winds and clouds.</p><p>The other creatures within the mist, apparently taking their cue, surged out in a swarm, charging towards Qin Sang.</p><p>With a flick of her sleeve, Qin Sang obliterated the creatures like melting snow. Glancing at the vanished beasts, she gathered a wisp of white energy into her palm.  These mist creatures reminded her of the cloud beasts from the ancient fairy battlefield of Xiao Han Domain; however, unlike the cloud beasts that left corpses behind, the only remnant of these creatures was this fleeting white energy, which soon dissipated, leaving no trace of their existence.</p><p>The serpent, finally losing its patience, opened its maw and unleashed a torrent of mist, hurtling towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  Her Grey Warbler sword flashed, appearing above the serpent before it could react, trapping it within a sword formation.</p><p>The sword formation was subtle, its workings entirely under Qin Sang's control.  In the vast expanse of the star sea, the serpent—perhaps for the first time since its creation—felt its own insignificance.  Anxiety and frustration surged through it as it roared, lashing its tail against the nearest star.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>The impacts reverberated through the star sea.</p><p>Qin Sang watched coldly, continuously launching starlight attacks at the serpent. After a while, however, she noticed the serpent's attacks were repetitive, lacking any strategic sense to break the formation.</p><p>With a subtle shift in her intent, Qin Sang intentionally exposed a minor flaw in the formation. The serpent immediately seized upon it, turning to attack.  Qin Sang swiftly corrected the flaw, changing the formation's configuration, only to have the serpent repeat its earlier, predictable attacks.</p><p>"Highly sensitive perception, but limited intelligence. It acts purely on instinct," she mused. "If I were weaker, its repeated attacks would eventually wear me down, forcing me to reveal more serious flaws."</p><p>Observing the serpent, Qin Sang concluded, "While powerful, even an early Nascent Soul cultivator could handle it."</p><p>Reaching this conclusion, Qin Sang held nothing back, activating a double-layered sword formation.  Sword beams rained down relentlessly upon the serpent.</p><p>Finally, the serpent succumbed, its body sliced into several sections. Yet, with a ripple of mist, it reformed, though weaker and smaller.  This was the frustrating aspect of these creatures—they lacked vital points, making them extremely difficult to kill.</p><p>Qin Sang relentlessly bombarded it with sword beams, and slowly, the serpent's form shrank until it finally vanished. Like the others, it left behind only a fleeting wisp of white energy, quickly dissolving into nothingness.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang vanquish the beast, the others gathered, erasing any lingering traces of its presence before fleeing on their magic vessel.</p><p>Shortly after, two streaks of light arrived—two Si You Cultivators.  After searching the area, one of them spoke in astonishment, "Did our master misjudge? There are no mist beasts here."</p><p>"Master deduced from celestial signs that a Void Realm mist beast might appear in this region. We were only sent to investigate, not to guarantee we'd find one."</p><p>The other cultivator looked around, a relieved smile spreading across his face. "It's better this way.  If there was a Void Realm mist beast, we'd have to stay and guard this place. Now we can return and report."</p><p>His companion stopped him. "Wait! Let's search a little longer…"</p><p>The two continued their search for a while longer, but finding nothing, eventually departed.</p>
