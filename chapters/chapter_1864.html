<h1>Chapter 1855: Divine Light Reappears</h1><p>Seven Tapir Demons spread out in an arc, blocking Qin Sang outside the mountain.</p><p>Although their appearances differed, the gazes they fixed upon Qin Sang were identical, their strength and aura indistinguishable.</p><p>“Moo!”</p><p>The mature Tapir Demon at the center raised its head and let out a bovine bellow. The roar was deafening, and within the sound, strange fluctuations rippled. The eyes of all seven Tapir Demons turned crimson, radiating a ferocious light.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang charged forward.</p><p>At this moment, a scene of indistinguishable reality and illusion unfolded before him. Clouds and mist swirled, the mountain was a tapestry of verdant green, and below, the river wound like a jade belt.</p><p>Were it not for these ferocious Tapir Demons, it could easily be mistaken for an Immortal Mountain.</p><p>All these scenes were conjured from within Dingxianghou's dream.</p><p>However, the malevolent aura was palpable, and Qin Sang's sensations were intensely real.  Then, flashes of white streaked across his vision.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>In an instant, the seven Tapir Demons surrounded Qin Sang.  The naked eye could only perceive seven streaks of white light, the demons' forms blurred beyond recognition.</p><p>A blinding white enveloped Qin Sang. The Tapir Demons seemed intent on confusing his judgment, the seven white lights moving at extreme speed, weaving themselves into a white, silken sphere.</p><p>Within the sphere, Qin Sang felt the surrounding energies in disarray. Attacks could come from any direction at any moment, making defense incredibly difficult.</p><p>However, through the eyes of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, the seven demons' trajectories were clear and distinct. They couldn't hope to disturb Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly and charged forward, disregarding the number or position of the Tapir Demons before him.  He raised his right palm, channeling the power of the Buddha Seal. A giant golden palm slammed forward.</p><p>Furious roars assaulted Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The seven Tapir Demons moved in unison.</p><p>Two demons from Qin Sang’s left and right lunged at his vulnerable flanks. The three behind him advanced simultaneously, all in their true demon forms, claws poised to tear at Qin Sang's back, ripping out his heart.</p><p>Directly in front of Qin Sang were a young Tapir Demon and another in human form, both with solemn expressions, standing shoulder to shoulder, prepared to meet the Buddha Palm and momentarily obstruct Qin Sang.</p><p>With such seamless coordination, no enemy could hope to escape.</p><p>But at this moment, Qin Sang retreated instead of advancing. He abruptly turned, his gaze cold as he fixed it upon the three Tapir Demons behind him.  His seal followed his body's rotation, and he slammed his palm down!</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>None of the three Tapir Demons were spared. Struck squarely on their foreheads by the palm, they emitted a dull thud and collapsed, transforming into three wisps of white smoke that merged into the surrounding clouds and mist.</p><p>The remaining four Tapir Demons were momentarily stunned. The two from the flanks had also lunged in vain.</p><p>Seven demons had attacked, yet they hadn't even grazed Qin Sang. Instead, three had been instantly annihilated.</p><p>The surviving four Tapir Demons retreated in succession, but Qin Sang pressed his advantage, several consecutive palm strikes extinguishing two more.</p><p>Within the mountain's belly, Dingxianghou's eyelids twitched slightly, but he did not awaken.</p><p>The last two Tapir Demons suddenly ceased their struggle and perished under Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>With the path clear, Qin Sang was still wary. He charged straight towards the mountain peak, tearing through Dingxianghou's dreamscape.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang discreetly formed a Lightning Incantation, the Divine Firmament Lightning Seal within his altar flashing with thunderous light.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A bolt of lightning split the clear sky, shaking the earth.</p><p>Lightning illuminated the entire dreamscape. The Seal of Heavenly Thunder formed, and a silvery white radiance filled the sky above.</p><p>Under the might of the thunder, all demonic evils cowered. The cloud-shrouded, hazy dreamscape was momentarily imbued with a sense of clarity.</p><p>At the peak of the lightning's intensity, a bolt of Heavenly Thunder descended from the sky, striking the mountaintop.  Countless bolts of Skyfire Lightning and lightning rained down like a deluge, blotting out the sky, their power terrifying, as if they intended to obliterate Dingxianghou's dream.</p><p>Just then, the surrounding scene warped. The mountain peak and all the scenery vanished, replaced by a massive thundercloud.</p><p>Dingxianghou himself was hidden within the thundercloud, as if he had been floating in the sky all along. Within the cloud, thunder rumbled, lightning flashed continuously, and bolts of lightning danced, connecting with the lightning outside.</p><p>At this moment, the thundercloud merged with the surrounding lightning and Skyfire Lightning.  To be precise, Dingxianghou actively altered his dream, merging it with the surrounding environment rather than confronting it.</p><p>Because of this, the power of Qin Sang's Lightning Talisman remained undiminished, but its destructive effect on the dreamscape was greatly reduced. It could no longer destroy the dream or harm Dingxianghou.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel at the profoundness of Dream Dao magic. As long as the imagination was boundless, it could adapt to any attack.</p><p>No magical power was perfect; there were always limitations.  But Qin Sang didn't have the time to unravel Dingxianghou's dream bit by bit.</p><p>Amidst the rumbling thunder, clouds within the dark mass shifted and transformed, and the seven Tapir Demons reappeared, identical to before.</p><p>As expected, no matter how many times their illusory bodies were destroyed, as long as Dingxianghou hadn't exhausted his power and could continue to manipulate the dreamscape, the illusions could be reborn.</p><p>‘Moo!’</p><p>The seven demons pounced, attempting to prevent Qin Sang from approaching the thundercloud.</p><p>Having learned their lesson, they moved with greater coordination.  They didn't rush to encircle Qin Sang but instead spread out before him in a staggered formation, subtly aligned with the principles of formations. Because the seven demons were essentially one, their cooperation was impeccable.</p><p>Qin Sang remained undaunted.  Without hesitation, he charged directly into the formation.</p><p>A strange glint flashed in the eyes of the seven demons. They appeared frenzied, launching a furious assault on Qin Sang.</p><p>For a time, the dreamscape was plunged into chaos.</p><p>White light filled the battlefield. The figures of Qin Sang and the seven demons became indistinct, leaving only the incessant roars, the sounds of collisions, and even the screeching of claws against armor.</p><p>Within moments, the white light expanded nearly twofold, the roars of the Tapir Demons growing more frantic.</p><p>Evidently, even their formation couldn't contain Qin Sang.  Instead, they themselves were frequently in danger, forced to expand their encirclement.</p><p>By now, the power of the Lightning Talisman was waning, the lightning and Skyfire Lightning within the dreamscape fading, nearing their end.</p><p>The thundercloud remained suspended, Dingxianghou within, unharmed, his eyelids twitching rapidly.</p><p>Qin Sang, in the heart of the formation, sensed something and abruptly looked up at the thundercloud, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.</p><p>He saw a mass of white qi gathering at the edge of the thundercloud, transforming into a new jade壶 (hu - pot/ewer).</p><p>This jade ewer was identical in appearance to the Spiritual Treasure Jade Ewer currently battling the Cloud Roaming Sword.</p><p>“Could there be two jade ewers?”</p><p>Qin Sang's face grew grave.</p><p>If this was a product of the dream, could it conjure a Spiritual Treasure of comparable power?</p><p>In a flash, the dream-ewer drifted towards the battlefield, mirroring the actions of the real Spiritual Treasure Jade Ewer.  Its spout tilted, pouring out white smoke.</p><p>Billowing smoke transformed into a vast river of white mist in the air, flowing majestically, its momentum no less impressive than the river unleashed by the real jade ewer.</p><p>“Such potent Dream Dao magic!”</p><p>Qin Sang abandoned his last shred of hope. With a flick of his sleeve, a point of cold light shot out, revealing the Four Jiaos Snake Seal in mid-air.</p><p>Four Jiaos snakes detached from the seal, their bodies wreathed in icy flames.</p><p>Their massive forms danced within the flames, their fierce eyes fixed on the white mist river as they swooped down.</p><p>Facing the oncoming wave, the four Jiaos snakes neither retreated nor flinched.  Wielding boundless icy flames, they advanced side-by-side, plunging into the heart of the river.</p><p>‘Rumble…Rumble…’</p><p>The river's heart roared, the sound deafening.</p><p>Mist churned violently, waves surged, and the shadowy forms of the Jiaos snakes could be faintly seen rising and falling beneath the surface.</p><p>The waves churned with a mixture of white mist and icy flames, the collision of these two forces earth-shattering.</p><p>In an instant, giant waves exploded in mid-air, eclipsing even the Heavenly Thunder.</p><p>Meanwhile, the four Jiaos snakes, their bodies undulating, rode the waves, carrying icy flames as they swam upstream.  Wherever they passed, the river collapsed, the dispersing white mist resembling a bursting dam.</p><p>The scene truly resembled the legendary Jiaos dragons traversing the waters!</p><p>The dream-ewer's body continued to tilt, pouring out an endless stream of mist into the river, resisting the Jiaos snakes and their icy flames.</p><p>Dingxianghou's eyelids trembled more rapidly.</p><p>Qin Sang marveled at Dingxianghou's magic. He himself was equally surprised. His opponent not only surpassed him in the Dao of Dharma Manifestations but could also casually produce two Spiritual Treasures. Who knew how many more tricks he had hidden?</p><p>“Fortunately, a dream conjuration is ultimately inferior to a true Spiritual Treasure. The Four Jiaos Snake Seal and I aren't perfectly attuned, and my cultivation is below this demon's, yet we can fight on equal footing…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly, then sensed several gusts of malevolent wind approaching.  His eyes flashed coldly, he beat his phoenix wings powerfully, and simultaneously unleashed a punch with all his might.</p><p>In the next instant, his figure appeared before a young Tapir Demon.</p><p>This demon, surprisingly lifelike, displayed a human-like astonishment, hastily dodging.</p><p>The surrounding Tapir Demons rushed to its aid. Empowered by the formation, they should have been able to instantly shift their formation to rescue the young demon.  However, the resulting formation felt strangely awkward.</p><p>This awkwardness stemmed from Qin Sang.  With a simple, timely step to the side, he stood upon the formation's crucial point, causing a momentary lapse in its flow.</p><p>By the time the demons tried to compensate, it was too late. Qin Sang's figure flickered, lunging at the nearest demon. With a single palm strike, the Sword Qi within his palm pierced its skull.</p><p>The demon's eyes lost their light, turning into white mist like the others.</p><p>With one Tapir Demon eliminated, the formation crumbled.</p><p>The defeat of the remaining six was only a matter of time.</p><p>However, these Tapir Demons didn't give Qin Sang the opportunity to pick them off one by one. The moment the formation broke, they retreated together, forming a line in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>With roars, the six Tapir Demons' eyes intensified with ferocity.  They suddenly charged towards each other, as if intent on mutual destruction. In the blink of an eye, they merged into a single being, along with a wisp of nearly invisible white qi from the void.</p><p>The seven demons became one, transforming into a single, powerfully built adult Tapir Demon!</p><p>Simultaneously, a larger Tapir Demon phantom manifested behind it, clearly Dingxianghou's Dharma Manifestation.</p><p>Whether he had brought his Dharma Manifestation into the dream or the dream itself could conjure the power of a Dharma Manifestation was unclear. The phantom flickered and merged into the Tapir Demon's body.</p><p>“Moo!”</p><p>A world-shaking roar. The Tapir Demon vanished.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Two figures clashed and separated instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang staggered back several steps, his expression grave. Dingxianghou was far more formidable than anticipated. The dream Tapir Demon, fused with the Dharma Manifestation, possessed power nearly equal to his true form. He truly deserved his title as the foremost demon lord under the Spirit Nether King.</p><p>The Tapir Demon was sent flying backward.  Although appearing more disheveled than Qin Sang, it was unharmed. It raised its head, shook its trunk, and fearlessly charged at Qin Sang once more.</p><p>Man and demon were locked in fierce combat. The life-or-death struggle between two Nascent Soul powerhouses had become a purely physical brawl, almost a return to the basics.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang discerned a clue.  This Tapir Demon could be considered Dingxianghou's true form within the dream.</p><p>Dingxianghou's manifestation of this Tapir Demon was no simple feat. If Qin Sang could destroy this demon, even if Dingxianghou's true body wouldn't be directly affected, it was likely no new Tapir Demons would appear.</p><p>However, although he held the upper hand in the fierce battle due to the suppression of Heavenly Might, he couldn't hope to slay the Tapir Demon quickly.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>With a sharp sound, Qin Sang seized an opening, pressing his palm against the Tapir Demon’s chest. His fingers dug into the demon's breastbone, piercing through its fur like sharp blades, and he pulled downwards with force.</p><p>The Tapir Demon roared in fury, its front hooves stomping towards Qin Sang's head.  Anticipating this, Qin Sang raised his other arm to block the hooves. He twisted his waist, unleashing astonishing power, flipping the Tapir Demon over. While it struggled to right itself, Qin Sang raised both fists and smashed them towards the demon's abdomen.</p><p>The Tapir Demon reacted quickly, its body contorting unnaturally. It thrust its four hooves forward, blocking the fatal blow at the last possible moment. However, the powerful impact still penetrated its internal organs, sending tremors through its entire body as it was flung backward.</p><p>“Cough… Cough… Cough…”</p><p>A heart-wrenching cough.</p><p>The Tapir Demon’s breath came in ragged gasps. Then, darkness encroached.  Qin Sang, relentless, delivered another heavy blow.</p><p>In desperation, the Tapir Demon lashed out with its trunk, shrouding itself in billowing white mist. It curled into a ball, as if retreating into a protective shell, bracing itself for the impact.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  His fist transformed into a palm, pinning the Tapir Demon beneath it.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's expression, Dingxianghou's eyelids twitched violently.  A sense of unease washed over him for no apparent reason.</p><p>Sensing this, the Tapir Demon within the dream was about to abandon its defensive posture and break free.</p><p>Suddenly, a dazzling golden light erupted!</p><p>Qin Sang held the Tapir Demon down, his eyes fixed on the distant thundercloud.  Behind him, a golden sun slowly rose, illuminating the world.</p><p>The dark, gloomy dreamscape was instantly bathed in golden light, dispelling all shadows!</p><p>The Sun Wheel Seal!</p><p>Since obtaining this Buddha Seal, Qin Sang had frequently exchanged insights with the eminent monks of Mirror Stage Temple. Although he hadn't fully mastered it, he could now summon a golden sun.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's blood and True Essence surged within him, flowing towards the golden sun, converging within its core.</p><p>This technique, built upon the foundation of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, also integrated his True Essence and physical cultivation, erupting with power far beyond what ordinary cultivators could imagine!</p><p>The golden sun shone brightly.</p><p>The golden light grew increasingly radiant.</p><p>Qin Sang stood beneath the golden sun, resembling a Buddha with a halo, majestic and divine.</p><p>Even the pure white Tapir Demon was tinged with gold, and everything else was bathed in a golden glow, including the thundercloud where Dingxianghou hid.</p><p>Dingxianghou's body trembled.  Although asleep, his face expressed shock. He squeezed his eyes shut, seemingly resisting waking up.</p><p>The scene within the dream shifted rapidly: mountains and rivers, lava and deserts, dark nights and overcast skies, even a sun appeared, attempting to oppose the golden sun.</p><p>All to no avail!</p><p>The golden light pierced through heaven and earth, carrying a terrifying power that could melt everything, engulfing the entire dreamscape.</p><p>The scenery within the dream, like snow under the scorching sun, began to melt away, even the thundercloud showing signs of dissipating.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Cloud Roaming Sword and the Spiritual Treasure Jade Ewer were locked in battle near the edge of the battlefield. At the same moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Seizing an opportunity, the Cloud Roaming Sword broke through the smoke and clouds, reaching the vicinity of the Spiritual Treasure Jade Ewer. Its blade transformed into a crimson blood sword without warning.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A streak of blood-red light shot out from the sword, striking the jade ewer.</p><p>Simultaneously, the sword's tip turned, pointing directly at Dingxianghou!
