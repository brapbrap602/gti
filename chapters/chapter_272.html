<h1>Chapter 265: A Circle of Primordial Energy</h1><p>Chapter 265: A Circle of Primordial Energy</p><p>The strength of the Jiao dragon spirits should not differ too greatly; otherwise, the weaker spirit will not be able to withstand the pressure of the token and will explode to its death.</p><p>With each additional Jiao dragon spirit, the cultivator who controls the token increases in speed.</p><p>Daoist Xuanyu has only collected six Jiao dragon spirits, but all of them are terrifying existences at the pinnacle of the demon spirit stage, equivalent to cultivators at the false pellet realm; therefore, the speed of the token is astounding.</p><p>Currently, there is only one Jiao dragon spirit left. If the token had not been destroyed, then when the Jiao dragon spirit recovers, Qin Sang would be able to compete against the speed of cultivators at the latter stage of the foundation establishment realm when he controls this token!</p><p>What a pity!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed in regret and was about to pull his divine sense away when suddenly he felt a sob from the Jiao dragon spirit.</p><p>A moment later, a look of joy flashed on his face.</p><p>The other half of the Nine Dragon Sky Chariot token was still intact. The other half of this Jiao dragon spirit's body was in that half of the token, desperately resisting the melting of the lava.</p><p>The Jiao dragon spirit could sense the other half of its body. If he could enter the lava to retrieve it, then with a little nourishment, he would be able to obtain the complete Nine Dragon Sky Chariot token!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart was instantly set aflame. He looked down at the surging lava river, but his expression was somewhat hesitant.</p><p>The other half of the Nine Dragon Sky Chariot token was flowing with the lava and was now far away. It wouldn't be long before the Jiao dragon spirit would lose touch with it, even if it hadn't exhausted its energy.</p><p>The lava was terrifying and full of hidden dangers.</p><p>Moreover, he could not be sure whether he could find the Nine Dragon Sky Chariot token before his spiritual energy ran out.</p><p>If he wasted too much time, then the crater might also change.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Qin Sang finally made up his mind. He held the Nine Dragon Sky Chariot token in one hand, stimulated his spiritual energy to protect his body, and jumped into the lava river.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang stimulated his spiritual energy, rolled up the lava, and washed every nook and cranny of the space several times, using the lava to erase all aura and traces.</p><p>...</p><p>The air was filled with thunderous crashing sounds, and all he could see was surging lava.</p><p>The lava river was magnificent and vast, with countless branches crisscrossing and forming an unusually dense lava "water net". Some were even wider than the lava in the cavern.</p><p>Without the Jiao dragon spirit to guide him, Qin Sang would not have been able to find the other half of the Nine Dragon Sky Chariot token in such complex terrain.</p><p>After leaving the crater, the circular restriction was restored. Qin Sang stepped on the lava and flew away, with the restriction just above his head.</p><p>The lava was turbulent, comparable to the Nine Folds of the Wuiling River. It was extremely erratic, leaving him with very little room to move, forcing him to always be on his guard and dodge the massive waves.</p><p>Scorched by the high temperatures and occasionally being swallowed by the lava, Qin Sang's spiritual energy was rapidly being drained. The Nine Dragon Sky Chariot token was still being carried away by the current, and he could only chase after it patiently and slowly close the distance.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no fire spirit beasts in the lava, proving Qin Sang's earlier guess. The birth of fire spirit beasts was related to that totemic barrier.</p><p>He held the token in one hand, sensing the direction, while his other hand held the storage pouch of the old man from the Earth Rift and focused on breaking the restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang had several bottles of spirit pills that could replenish spiritual energy, but he didn't know if they would be enough. If he could open the storage pouch of the old man from the Earth Rift, he wouldn't have to worry about running out of spirit pills.</p><p>It was precisely because the old man from the Earth Rift had forced Qin Sang to use the power of the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound to break through the restrictions along the way that Qin Sang was so familiar with the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound and had gained considerable experience in restrictions. Otherwise, it might have taken him a long time to break the restriction on the storage pouch.</p><p>It had to be said that it was an immense irony.</p><p>Qin Sang swallowed three Qingling Pills to replenish his spiritual energy and fixed his gaze on a spot on the storage pouch. His spiritual energy suddenly burst forth from his palm, transforming into a flying needle and piercing it.</p><p>"Buzz!"</p><p>A ripple appeared on the storage pouch, accompanied by a buzzing sound.</p><p>Immediately after, the buzzing sound suddenly became deafening. A powerful sound wave shot out of the restriction without warning.</p><p>Qin Sang was prepared. His figure flashed quickly, and he dodged the sound wave easily.</p><p>"Splash!"</p><p>The sound wave sank into the lava river, creating a splash dozens of meters wide. The destructive power of the sound wave after it exploded made Qin Sang secretly shocked.</p><p>The sound waves sent the enchantment almost to its limits. Qin Sang did not give it a chance to recover and eventually completely broke the enchantment.</p><p>When the enchantment faded, Qin Sang was impatient to investigate with his divine consciousness. He soon found several elixirs similar to Azure Spirit Pills and clenched them in his hand, only then continuing his patient search.</p><p>Qin Sang was not interested in the common items, and as for healing elixirs, which there were many kinds of, Qin Sang was not surprised since he had expected to find them.</p><p>There was nothing left of his magical devices or spirit patterns, which Qin Sang guessed that Old Man Di Que had thrown away to resist the Skyblade Spirit Pattern; otherwise, it would not have been so empty.</p><p>To Qin Sang’s disappointment, he only found around ten thousand low-level spirit stones in the mustard seed pouch.</p><p>This would have been a fortune for a Foundation Stage monk, but Old Man Di Que was a famous Golden Core. This was nothing more than appalling.</p><p>However, Qin Sang quickly discovered that there were many valuable spiritual objects in the pouch.</p><p>Dark Yin Cold Iron, Three-Colored Phantom Lotus, Windthunder Origin Crystal...</p><p>There were also three kinds that Qin Sang did not recognize.</p><p>The value of each spiritual material was no less than Qianyang Crystals. Each was a very rare and valuable material for refining magical devices.</p><p>Was Old Man Di Que going to refine a magical device?</p><p>Qin Sang’s attention was attracted to a white, smooth golden ring the size of a bracelet. The golden ring emitted no spiritual light and was full of gaps. It seemed to have mysterious patterns on the surface, but they were too worn and damaged to see clearly.</p><p>At least the ring was not broken.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the ring and examined it in his hand, but could not use it. He guessed that it must be a magical device.</p><p>He wondered if Old Man Di Que wanted to repair it or make a new one.</p><p>His divine consciousness returned to the mustard seed pouch. There was only one place left. There were several jade slips and a black iron piece, as well as the jade bottle with the Red Fire Gilding, next to a jade slip.</p><p>Perhaps these were his greatest gains, Qin Sang thought to himself as he retrieved the jade slip and began reading.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang opened his eyes, thoughtful.</p><p>The jade slip contained the insights of a Yu Ling Sect Golden Core monk, including the inheritance unique to the Yu Ling Sect!</p><p>No wonder Old Man Di Que was so skilled in beast control and raising strange insects. All this knowledge came from the jade slip.</p><p>That meant Old Man Di Que had killed a Yu Ling Sect Golden Core before this. He had dared to remain at the Suspended Skull Pass and now, even attacked Daoist Xuanyu. He was utterly audacious.</p><p>From the jade slip, Qin Sang learned the name of the golden ring: the Void Harmony Ring.</p><p>As the name implied, the Void Harmony Ring was a Yin-Yang pair, the magical device of that Yu Ling Sect Golden Core monk. Now, only the Yin ring was left, and it was badly damaged.</p>
