Chapter 724 Ashamed

“Back then, the Daoist sacrificed himself to lure the enemies away. After we separated, we rushed to the island to seek help. Senior Ran Luo led people out to rescue the Daoist, but found nothing…”
In the quiet room, Qin Sang sat with the Wang sisters, listening to them recount their past experiences.
Qin Sang was somewhat stunned. No wonder the Wang sisters were so emotional when they saw him.
They witnessed Qin Sang single-handedly intercepting the enemy, allowing them to escape rather than using them as bait. Therefore, they regarded Qin Sang as their lifesaver, remembering him to this day.
Qin Sang actually hadn't thought that much about it. He urged them to leave quickly because their cultivation levels were too low. They wouldn't be of much help and would only become a burden.
An unintentional act held extraordinary significance for others.
However, one thing they said was correct.
Qin Sang indeed hadn't thought about using them as bait to attract the enemy's attention while he escaped.
“Congratulations, fellow Daoist, on stepping onto the Golden Core path. Your sister must also be close to breaking through, right? I wonder how the other three fellow Daoists are doing?”
Qin Sang looked at the two with a smile.
The elder Wang sister blushed and said,
“I was able to break through thanks to the Daoist.  During the years we followed the Daoist, seeing such profound cultivation yet still diligently practicing without slacking off, it greatly encouraged us.
“The valuable spiritual materials the Daoist gave us allowed my sister and me to accumulate enough cultivation resources to purchase high-quality Demon Slaying Pills. My sister then gave her Demon Slaying Pill to me, which allowed me to break through in one go. Now I am helping my sister gather Demon Slaying Pills. With her aptitude, she should be able to successfully form her Golden Core without any problems.
“The other three fellow Daoists have now returned to the Inner Sea.
“After the two seniors returned, they attempted to form their Golden Cores again, but unfortunately, they both failed. They frankly admitted that they had given up on forming their Golden Cores and returned home with their years of savings to nurture their only sons.
“Fellow Daoist Peng also sensed an opportunity for a breakthrough, but his cultivation method is unique and requires the protection of his master during the breakthrough. He had to return to his sect. He left not long ago. I don't know if he has succeeded in forming his Golden Core.
“Before the three fellow Daoists left, they all told me to find the Daoist.”
While they were talking, Ran Luo walked in from outside. Seeing Qin Sang, she was also overjoyed.
When asked about his experiences over the years, Qin Sang had no choice but to offer the excuse he had prepared beforehand. He claimed that his opponent back then was too powerful, and he was chased deep into the Demonic Sea, losing his way.  He was then afraid that those people were still lurking near the island, so he didn't dare to return for a long time.  He only dared to come back recently after learning that the war was over.
The three women didn't doubt him, and they all sighed with emotion.
“Cultivating diligently is the same wherever I am, it's nothing much... However, I just became a guest elder of the Chamber of Commerce and haven't done anything yet. I've been gone for twenty years, which has let down Ran Luo…”
Qin Sang said apologetically.
Ran Luo waved her hand, “The Daoist's safe return is a great blessing. Compared to the Daoist's safety, the Chamber of Commerce's trivial matters are nothing. If anyone is to blame, it's those who started the chaos and those few Witch Clan scoundrels. The Daoist might as well rest for a few days. I'll send this good news to Old Zou and hold a welcome banquet for the Daoist in a few days.”
Qin Sang didn't want to make such a fuss and quickly dissuaded Ran Luo, “Ran Luo, you don't know, when I first entered the Demonic Sea, I learned of a certain spiritual herb on Sky Witch Island, which I happen to need. I wanted to collect it fifteen years ago, but I was trapped in the Demonic Sea and have been delayed until now.  The spiritual herb has already matured. If I delay any longer, I'm afraid some demonic beast will get to it first. Time is pressing, so let's not bother. Please fetch the materials, and after I fulfill my duties as a guest elder and refine the tools, I will set off.”
Ran Luo quickly asked, “Is that spiritual herb growing near a demonic beast's lair? If there is danger, the Daoist might as well pick a few helpers from the Chamber of Commerce to go with you.”
“No worries. If it were fifteen years ago, I wouldn't have been completely confident. But as they say, misfortune brings fortune. Being trapped in the Demonic Sea, I also had quite a harvest, and my strength is not what it used to be.”
Qin Sang was full of confidence and added, “I also have a small matter I'd like to ask for your help with.”
Ran Luo straightened her face and said, “Please speak, Daoist.”
At this time, the Wang sisters tactfully excused themselves and left.
Walking out of the quiet room and closing the door, the elder Wang sister’s expression was somewhat gloomy when she saw Qin Sang only nod slightly at them without any intention of keeping them.
“Sister…”
The younger sister took her sister’s arm and looked into her eyes, wanting to speak but stopping.
The elder sister shook her head, as if talking to herself, and as if admonishing herself, “The Daoist is a devoted cultivator.”
The younger sister sighed softly and hugged her sister tightly.
The two sisters leaned on each other, gradually walking away.
In the quiet room, Ran Luo watched the Wang sisters leave and suddenly chuckled, “Perhaps the Daoist doesn’t know yet, but the Wang sisters were deeply impressed by the Daoist’s character. After the island was unsealed, they never stopped searching for the Daoist and even secretly investigated the culprits who harmed the Daoist. They are truly rare and loyal individuals…”
“I am humbled by their kindness. I am ashamed…”
Qin Sang fell silent, not continuing the topic. He changed the subject, “Ran Luo, I intend to enter the Seven Killing Palace and would like to ask the Chamber of Commerce to help keep an eye out for which power will be leading the next opening. The Chamber of Commerce mainly operates in the Inner Sea. Inquiring about this information shouldn’t be difficult, right?”
It had been almost twenty-five years since he arrived at the Roaring Waves Sea.
According to past practice, if any power was interested in the Seven Killing Palace, they should be starting to spread the word.
After all, preparing to break the immortal formation required an astonishing amount of resources. Even with the profound resources of those powers, it was still a burden, so they needed to prepare decades in advance and recoup their costs by selling entry qualifications.
He had thought that the conflict between the two races would affect the Seven Killing Palace, but now that the chaos had subsided, everything would return to normal.
Qin Sang was determined to gain access to the Seven Killing Palace. He needed to obtain the qualification first to be at ease.
Actually, he knew very well that even if he could find the ancient teleportation formation this time, he probably wouldn't be able to go back.
The Seven Killing Palace could be opened artificially, but the Violet Constellation Palace on the other side could not. Teleporting over would trap him inside, facing unknown dangers within.
He had to wait for the Seven Killing Palace to emerge on its own to return to the Small Cold Realm.
However, the ancient teleportation formation was probably not easy to find. If he waited until the Seven Killing Palace emerged and then went in, if he couldn't find the teleportation formation, he would have to wait another two hundred years for the next emergence, and by then, it would be too late.
So, this time, it was imperative.
Ran Luo was surprised to hear this and said in a serious tone, “When did you decide to go to the Seven Killing Palace, Daoist? How much do you know about it? Don't believe everything you hear! The easily obtainable treasures in the Seven Killing Palace have long been plundered. What remains are extremely dangerous forbidden areas, most of which even Nascent Soul ancestors are helpless against. Those who enter the Seven Killing Palace now are either overly confident in their strength or have no hope on the path of immortality and are taking a desperate gamble.  Daoist, you have just formed your Golden Core, with ample lifespan and a bright future. Why take such a risk?”
