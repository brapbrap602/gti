<h1>Chapter Nine Hundred and Thirty: The Deal</h1><p>Fang Laomo's appearance caused a brief stir, but calm quickly returned.</p><p>The cultivators waited patiently.</p><p>Past midnight.</p><p>The High Priestess's expression shifted slightly, her red lips parted gently: "Fellow Daoist Lingzhuzi, the time has come. I shall now activate the Thousand Swords Formation."</p><p>Lingzhuzi calculated with his fingers, his voice deep: "This Immortal Formation is currently at its weakest point. We will assist you with all our might, High Priestess. Begin."</p><p>With that, Lingzhuzi waved his whisk, and the other Nascent Soul cultivators dispersed, standing at the edge of the formation, channeling their true essence into the spiritual array.</p><p>Seeing this, the Golden Core cultivators stirred, retreating hastily, afraid of being caught in the formation's residual energy, yet unwilling to miss this opportunity to observe. They didn't retreat too far.</p><p>Soon, the Nascent Soul cultivators of both clans were spread out.</p><p>At the center of the formation, Lingzhuzi and Fang Laomo stood on either side of the High Priestess.</p><p>The High Priestess took a deep breath, her jade hand rising gently. Ripples appeared on the water's surface below, and a milky white point of light rose slowly from the sea, gradually elongating into a slender spiritual sword.</p><p>Next, the High Priestess's other hand produced a mustard seed pouch.</p><p>With the opening facing down, a flash of light erupted, and spirit stones poured into the sea like flowing water, all of them high-grade!</p><p>So many spirit stones stunned the Golden Core cultivators outside.  They finally understood why a single jade talisman was so expensive. And this was only the spirit stones; the spiritual materials consumed in setting up the formation were an astronomical figure they couldn't even imagine.</p><p>Perhaps only the most powerful forces could afford such a cost.</p><p>The spirit stones landed precisely on the points of light in the sea, disappearing without a sound as they were absorbed.  These points of light grew brighter, slowly rising like the one summoned by the High Priestess, ultimately transforming into slender swords.</p><p>The surrounding Nascent Soul cultivators acted in unison.</p><p>Each controlled the light swords around them, transforming them into streams of light that flowed towards the center of the formation. Their speed and momentum were astonishing.</p><p>This step was clearly not easy, as all the Nascent Soul cultivators displayed strained expressions, some even using magical treasures to assist them.</p><p>The High Priestess's gaze sharpened, turning to Lingzhuzi and Fang Laomo.</p><p>The man and the cicada each released a beam of light, one green and one yellow, connecting to the central light sword as if lifting it upwards with great effort.</p><p>At the same time, streams of light shot towards the central sword, merging into it.</p><p>Without a ripple, the light sword acted like a bottomless pit, devouring everything.</p><p>In an instant, a thousand swords merged into one, gathering the entire formation's power, an astonishing force concentrated at a single point.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others, standing at the outermost perimeter, felt only a vague sensation, yet it was enough to make their scalps tingle and their hearts pound with fear.</p><p>Lingzhuzi's expression was grave, his whisk connected to the light sword, his arm trembling slightly.</p><p>Fang Laomo spread his wings, vibrating them rapidly. The cicada's cry grew even sharper, irritating those who heard it.</p><p>The most strenuous effort came from the High Priestess, who presided over the Thousand Swords Formation.  Her gaze was like water, her red lips pressed tightly together, her hand seals changing constantly as she infused countless incantations into the light sword.</p><p>Because of this, the light sword, despite absorbing a thousand others, remained stable and grew increasingly solid.</p><p>Finally, a jade-white spiritual sword appeared above everyone.</p><p>The sword was about three feet long, crystalline and jade-like, its body covered in runes, resembling a celestial sword.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The High Priestess suddenly raised her jade hand and pointed towards the Immortal Formation. The spiritual sword trembled slightly, then vanished into the gray wind wall with a flash. After a brief silence, a terrifying, invisible wave erupted within the wall.</p><p>The cultivators felt as if struck by an invisible hammer, their escaping lights wavering.</p><p>The next moment, a familiar scene unfolded. The gray wind wall began to shatter from within, countless cracks spreading outwards in all directions.  Each crack seemed to contain a light sword, opening a path for the cultivators.</p><p>"Move!"</p><p>The High Priestess and Lingzhuzi shouted almost simultaneously.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators quickly took out their jade talismans, instantly passing through the gaps and into the wind wall.</p><p>Qin Sang was not slow either. He had already made his preparations and immediately raised his talisman, choosing a gap and rushing in.  The talisman's power had already been activated before he entered.</p><p>This time, it wasn't a blood-colored shield, but a sword-like beam of light that enveloped his body, clearing a path through the storm.  He soon encountered the first impact.</p><p>Qin Sang, revisiting this experience, reacted calmly. Protected by the talisman, he successfully withstood the impact of the Immortal Formation, passed through it, and descended from the sky onto the barren plain.</p><p>The plain was exceptionally vast.</p><p>Qin Sang's feet touched solid ground. He looked up and saw figures passing through the Immortal Formation, descending from the sky, each landing in a different location.</p><p>After a brief pause, these figures immediately took action, flying off in all directions, disappearing into the deep mountains and dense forests.</p><p>"I'm back!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, first glancing towards the Heavenly Tower, then turning and flying towards the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, deciding to retrieve the Nine Nether Demonic Fire first.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang arrived at the ancient forest that led to the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>He vividly remembered his first encounter with Xiang Yi, aware of the dangerous insects and beasts within the forest. He had prepared several types of medicinal powders and wore them on his person.</p><p>With a flick of his fingers, he used an invisibility spell and entered the forest, searching for the purple river.</p><p>Qin Sang moved cautiously, unsure if the East Pole Alliance would send anyone to the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone to activate the ancient divine platform, causing further complications.</p><p>As Qin Sang swiftly flew towards the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone...</p><p>Deep within the mountains, the Nascent Soul cultivators of the two clans were not far apart, flying towards the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>Mou Laomo glanced towards the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, then scanned the Nascent Soul cultivators around him, but detected nothing unusual.</p><p>He pondered for a moment, then suddenly transmitted a message to the blood-robed elder beside him.</p><p>The blood-robed elder was startled. "Mou Laomo, you dare defy the orders of Lingzhuzi and the Demon Lord!  Are you tired of living? Don't drag me down with you!"</p><p>"Heh heh, Blood Devil, do you think I don't know your secrets? You want to use the Seven Slaughter Palace's ancient restriction to refine that evil artifact to help you overcome your next tribulation.  Your chances of success are less than ten percent, right? Without that artifact, you probably won't live for another hundred years. If you help me this once, I can borrow the Heavenly Astral Ring from Wen Laomo for you."</p><p>Mou Laomo suppressed his anxiety and proposed a deal to the blood-robed elder.</p><p>The blood-robed elder's expression flickered, and he said in disbelief, "The Heavenly Astral Ring is Wen Laomo's lifeblood, as precious as his own life. You think you can just borrow it?"</p><p>"Wen Laomo owes me a big favor. Borrowing the Heavenly Astral Ring once is still possible! Although the Heavenly Astral Ring's effect is not as good as your evil artifact, it's still a rare treasure that can give you a fighting chance."</p><p>Mou Laomo looked confident. "Besides, I'm not exactly disobeying orders this time.  As long as you give it your all, I'm sure nothing will go wrong."</p><p>The blood-robed elder was clearly tempted, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>"Fine! I'll trust you this once! But if you dare trick me, I don't have much time left, and I won't have any scruples. Watch out for your Heavenly Wind Island!"</p>
