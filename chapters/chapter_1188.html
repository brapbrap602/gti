<h1>Chapter 1180: The幽晶 Tower</h1><p>After years of warfare, cultivators from both realms, battle-hardened, moved within the vast encampment.  Streams of escaping light crisscrossed the sky, yet there was no sign of chaos; everything was orderly and well-organized.  </p><p>Soon, the battle formations were perfectly aligned, ready for battle.</p><p>A deathly silence fell over the camp, an atmosphere of intense killing intent.</p><p>Every soldier bore the marks of countless battles.</p><p>Qin Sang overlooked the scene from a tall building, remembering the Battle of Yun Cang Marsh.</p><p>Back then, he, like those below him, was merely a pawn.</p><p>From the perspective of a Yuan Ying master, that battle seemed rather childish, with both sides deploying a surprisingly small number of Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>The cause was even more absurd; so many lives lost, all for a Yuan Ying duel between the two realms, a gamble over the materials for array formation, perhaps with a hint of intent to hone disciples' skills.</p><p>This time was different. Yuan Ying masters were personally involved, affecting three realms and the Heavenly Demon Ridge; this was a true fight for survival!</p><p>As the cultivators assembled, the great array began to change.</p><p>The outer layer of cold mist silently rolled towards the center, the power of the Cold Bell Array contracting, its range reduced by more than half.</p><p>Si Di stood at the forefront of the battle array, his gaze cold as he surveyed the outside.</p><p>After a moment, he waved his hand sharply, and the battle array moved out!</p><p>Si Di was the core of the entire array, each other Golden Core cultivator commanding a smaller unit, mostly composed of Foundation Establishment cultivators. Squad after squad of cultivators flew towards the edge of the Cold Bell Array in perfect order.</p><p>The composition of each squad wasn't solely based on the cultivators' cultivation level or sect, but also on their complementary skills and mastery of the five elemental arts.  This careful arrangement ensured close coordination and maximized their combat effectiveness.</p><p>Some of these cultivators wore armor, others wielded various peculiar artifacts— clearly standardized equipment with special uses in battle.</p><p>Qin Sang had rarely witnessed such a scene, and his outward appearance being that of an outsider, he did not ask questions, but simply watched quietly.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, everyone disappeared into the cold mist.</p><p>This was the battlefield chosen by Si Di. The mist was a manifestation of the Cold Bell Array. Their own side carried a special artifact that shielded them from the mist's effects, while the enemy would be severely hampered.</p><p>Moreover, only those within the array, controlling it, could adjust the formation and provide support in a timely manner.</p><p>“Daoist Mingyue, it's our turn to move.”</p><p>Jing Lin whispered.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, activating a secret technique to conceal his aura and form, and flew out of the tall building with Jing Lin, quietly heading towards the center of the battlefield.</p><p>The area outside the Cold Bell Array was now calm.</p><p>The terrain of Sandie Pass was low in the middle and high on both sides. Their position was at the exit above Sandie Pass; any unusual activity below would be easily detected.</p><p>The biting winter wind, especially sharp on the Tianxing Plateau, cut like knives. As far as the eye could see, everything was covered in snow, soon to be stained crimson.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Lin hid in a high place.</p><p>As they had previously discussed, due to the time constraint, they couldn't be too far from the battlefield. For safety, they carefully set up a concealment array to avoid detection.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Si Di had sent out scouts.</p><p>There was still no sign of the Zuyuan army.</p><p>However, these were cultivators; a little cold was nothing. Everyone remained in position, resting.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>"No news from Shiqu Mountain yet?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked out for a while, then turned to ask Jing Lin.</p><p>Upon discovering Zuyuan's movement, they decisively withdrew their troops and reported the situation.</p><p>Jing Lin nodded, "If Zuyuan were to attack, they wouldn't just target our Sandie Pass. Shiqu Mountain needs to gather information from various locations and verify the situation; it's impossible to get a response that quickly…"</p><p>Just as he spoke, a swift stream of escaping light suddenly rushed into the array. Then, escaping lights and talismans carrying messages flew in from all directions like snowflakes.</p><p>Without even looking, they knew something was happening.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Lin exchanged a glance, activating their concealment array to its fullest capacity, holding their breaths.</p><p>Secretly, he awakened the Tianmu Butterfly, instructing it to use its heavenly eye ability to monitor the enemy. If the Zuyuan army concealed any treasures or individuals, encountering the Tianmu Butterfly would be their undoing.</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>With a command from Si Di, war drums suddenly thundered.</p><p>The drumbeats were deafening.</p><p>They even employed this mundane battlefield tactic, but it had to be admitted that the effect was excellent.  The powerful drumbeats boosted morale, igniting their fighting spirit.</p><p>At that moment, several dark shadows appeared on the horizon.</p><p>The scouts from both sides clashed first, engaged for a while, then several streams of escaping light flew back into the array. The Zuyuan troops halted, a distance from the array, gazing for a moment before turning back.</p><p>After a brief skirmish, more and more shadowy figures appeared on the horizon.  A massive army pressed forward.  The leading ranks were now vaguely visible.</p><p>Xiaohan Domain, Tianxing Alliance, and Zuoyan, compared to Beichen Territory, occupied roughly the northern and eastern regions. There was almost no desert separating them, forming a long, narrow area.</p><p>The three powers were essentially contiguous; all human, and perhaps even originally united centuries ago, without such clear divisions. Their methods were also very similar.</p><p>Zuoyan cultivators wore similar armor and equipment. The biggest difference was the three black crystal towers standing in the center of the Zuoyan army.</p><p>The towers seemed to be made of black crystal, each three stories tall, completely windowless, although markings resembling doors and windows were carved onto their surfaces.  Atop each tower sat a spherical crystal orb, of the same material.</p><p>Each tower was nearly ten meters tall and identical in appearance. Perhaps due to the material, no runes were visible from the outside.</p><p>Marching across the snow, the towering towers were extremely conspicuous within the army. Several cultivators stood beside each tower, supporting and escorting it as the army advanced.</p><p>Zuoyan clearly placed great importance on these towers; the three were positioned deep within their ranks, heavily guarded.</p><p>Seeing the towers, Jing Lin's expression darkened.  "Three Shadow Crystal Towers!  With three of these, a Yuan Ying cultivator must control them personally.  Tan Laomo and Pei Laomo have indeed deployed their full strength!"</p><p>He referred to Zuoyan's two Yuan Ying cultivators. These two had previously led their armies in skirmishes, harassing the opposing side, but had never been decisively defeated. Jing Lin’s tone regarding the enemy was, unsurprisingly, less than complimentary.</p><p>“Are those Zuoyan’s Shadow Crystal Towers?” Qin Sang stared at the three towers.</p><p>Although he had seen information about them before, this was his first time witnessing them. Seeing is believing.</p><p>Facing the Shadow Crystal Towers directly, Qin Sang felt a distinct unease, the reason unclear.  The records indicated that these were not ordinary treasures, but specialized war-forged artifacts used in battle formations.</p><p>“Indeed, those are Shadow Crystal Towers! Fortunately, there are limitations to their use; Zuoyan can’t use them recklessly. Otherwise, we’d be constantly running and wouldn’t know how to fight…” Jing Lin sighed in relief.</p>
