<h1>Chapter 1272: A Fleeting Dream</h1><p>Dongyang Bo was certain Qin Sang wouldn't dare kill him in public.</p><p>As long as he was careful, he wasn't afraid of Qin Sang's underhanded tricks.</p><p>Qin Sang had indeed removed her mask.</p><p>Dongyang Bo keenly noticed the others' ambiguous attitudes towards Qin Sang—a subtle mix of apprehension and respect, a testament to her power.</p><p>Upon learning about the events in the Blood Gate, Dongyang Bo was shocked.</p><p>Qin Sang's performance exceeded his expectations; destroying Ye Laomo's incarnation was an unprecedented feat for the Two Realms Alliance!</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang looked up slightly and met Dongyang Bo's gaze.</p><p>Both their eyes remained unwavering, their contact brief.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed Dongyang Bo's intentions. He chose to conceal the fight: firstly, to avoid a public confrontation and forcing others to choose sides immediately; secondly, to cover up his shameful act of attacking an ally.</p><p>Revealing it publicly—even if Dongyang Bo retaliated—others might not believe his lies.</p><p>Sometimes, the truth doesn't matter.</p><p>Qin Sang had obtained the Nascent Soul puppet and naturally wouldn't mention it.</p><p>Qing Jun, the only one privy to the truth, seeing the two act as if nothing happened, could only sigh, "A meeting of kindred spirits."</p><p>At this time, Tongyou Mojun, who had entered the blood mist to investigate, returned and said gravely, "The monsters are similar to flesh and blood puppets in strength, but are even more ferocious and bloodthirsty. This place is extremely dangerous. What do you all think?"</p><p>Everyone looked at each other.</p><p>They had their own agendas beforehand.</p><p>Some wanted to return to the Black Pagoda Formation, explore the ruins, and search for treasures.</p><p>Some wanted to search for fragments of the Interminable Blood Mulberry.</p><p>…</p><p>But now, none of that was possible. If these monsters roamed freely instead of remaining dormant, it would be difficult to enter the Blood Lake again.</p><p>After a brief discussion, Qin Sang and Qing Jun decided to leave.</p><p>Jing Yu hadn't found the Interminable Blood Mulberry in the blood pool, and the Blood Lake was vast; searching for it here was like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Without the Positive and Negative Nine Palaces Formation, everything was unpredictable.</p><p>If surrounded by monsters, even with his superb escape techniques, he wouldn't be able to survive.</p><p>He had plenty of time; there would be other opportunities.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun understood everyone's thoughts. After asking Qin Sang and a few others, he coldly said, "Whether you leave or stay is your own decision. However, let me make it clear: if the monsters show any sign of breaking out of the Blood Lake, we will immediately seal it!"</p><p>Hearing this, the crowd was in an uproar.</p><p>Even the most powerful individuals were unwilling to risk it.</p><p>Nobody knew the location of the treasures and could only search blindly. Missing the opportunity, even if they survived, they would be trapped in the Blood Lake forever.</p><p>Unless they had Jing Yu's luck, and someone came to rescue them.</p><p>Who would dare stay?</p><p>Everyone cast a lingering glance at the Black Pagoda Formation, sighing inwardly before agreeing to retreat.</p><p>Dongyang Bo entered the Positive and Negative Nine Palaces Formation.</p><p>They took turns manipulating the jade talismans, with Dongyang Bo leading the way, avoiding the territory of the monster leaders, and quickly moving through the blood mist to find a way out.</p><p>Luckily, they encountered some manageable monsters along the way and dealt with them before alerting others.</p><p>As they were about to leave the basin…</p><p>For some reason, the three master and disciples of the Taiyi Danzong had a dispute.</p><p>"Master, you absolutely mustn't! That ancient prohibition is incredibly powerful and extremely dangerous…"</p><p>Si Di exclaimed, rushing to block Daoist Chongyi.</p><p>Everyone looked over.  Since leaving the Blood Gate, the three had been muttering, no one knew what they were doing.</p><p>"Insolence!"</p><p>Daoist Chongyi sternly rebuked, displaying the authority of a master, "What I do doesn't require your permission! While I failed to pass through it before, the ancient prohibition was impacted when the seal was broken, making it the perfect opportunity."</p><p>Another disciple, whose dharma name was Yaojing, seeing Daoist Chongyi's resolve, said, "My senior brother and I will accompany Master."</p><p>"Foolish! I'm half a step away from the underworld; my death means nothing. If you're implicated because of me, what meaning will my centuries of hard work have?"</p><p>Unable to dissuade them, Daoist Chongyi angrily shouted, "I ask all fellow Daoists to bear witness! After I leave, if these two unfilial disciples dare to take a single step, I will expel them from the sect today, forever barring them from setting foot in Taiyi Danzong! This is my solemn oath, witnessed by both gods and men!"</p><p>With that, Daoist Chongyi flung his whisk, drawing a line on the ground.</p><p>Seeing their master's determination, Si Di and Yaojing trembled, their faces filled with grief.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun and the others understood the situation and tried to dissuade him.</p><p>"This place is extremely dangerous, Daoist, think again!"</p><p>Daoist Chongyi bowed, saying calmly, "The heavenly tribulation is imminent, time is short. Rather than clinging to life, it's better to give it my all."</p><p>"Farewell, my fellow cultivators!"</p><p>News of the ancient cultivator's actions had initially offered a glimmer of hope, but it quickly vanished like a dream.</p><p>Master Chongyi, devoted to his sect all his life, finally had no regrets. With two Nascent Soul cultivators now protecting the Taiyi Danzong, he smiled as he went to his death.</p><p>With that, he raised his whisk, and walked towards the bloody mist.</p><p>A faint song drifted on the air:</p><p>In youth I ascended Taiyi, a carefree immortal, so bold.</p><p>A thousand years have flown by now, a dream upon a millet stalk told.</p><p>Everyone was silent, watching as Master Chongyi's back disappeared into the bloody mist.  Some among them had only recently achieved Nascent Soul, yet to experience the pressure of the Heavenly Tribulation.  Others faced a similar situation to Master Chongyi, but were burdened by too many concerns, lacking the courage to fight to the death.  However, everyone understood Master Chongyi's feelings. Even Dongyang Bo, who had long been at odds with him, felt a deep respect for the old fellow.</p><p>They all joined forces to urge Si Di and Yao Jing to continue pushing towards the edge of the Blood Lake.</p><p>Along the way, they found the number of monsters increasing.  Silently, they reached the entrance to the Blood Lake seal, thankfully finding the monsters hadn't yet gathered there. Relieved, they quickly flew out.</p><p>Several figures were guarding the seal's exterior, staring fearfully at the Blood Lake, still shaken.  They were the remaining Gold Core cultivators who had entered earlier, only about a quarter of their original number.</p><p>After escaping the Blood Lake, they didn't leave, nor did they rush to repair the seal.  Unanimously, they worked together to eliminate the wandering monsters, waiting for Master Chongyi.  Moved by his decisive action, they displayed a rare unity of purpose.</p><p>Si Di and Yao Jing anxiously guarded Master Chongyi's spirit tablet.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the various reactions.</p><p>The newly ascended Nascent Souls were thoughtful.  Before, they had only heard tales, not fully understanding the cruelty of the Heavenly Tribulation.  For most, it was their first direct encounter with its harsh reality.</p><p>Qing Jun remained calm, her resolve unwavering.  She had long since defined her path, unmoved by external influences or people.</p><p>A flicker of relief crossed Jing Yu's eyes.  The price of two hundred years of imprisonment had been worth it. She had finally obtained the Corpse Flower Blood Jade, securing a lifeline.</p><p>The older Nascent Souls, including Master Tongyou, all faced the threat of the Heavenly Tribulation, their expressions grave.</p><p>Dongyang Bo stood alone on the outer edge, hands clasped behind his back, his head tilted upward towards the sky, lost in thought.</p><p>Time ticked by.</p><p>The Blood Lake grew increasingly chaotic.</p><p>Qin Sang also joined the effort, and together they fought back the monsters, but it was clear they couldn't hold out much longer. The monsters had discovered the breach in the seal and were beginning to converge.</p><p>There was still no sign of Master Chongyi.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A faint sound, like a thunderclap, shattered the calm in everyone's hearts.</p><p>The spirit tablet had broken.</p>
