<h1>Chapter 1364: Sentiment</h1><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled leisurely through the courtyard.</p><p>Today was the day of the Outer Sect disciples' competition.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu presided over the competition.</p><p>She and her Daoist partner were a deeply loving couple, an enviable pair in Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The arena was set on the bank of a great river, atop the highest peak of the Outer Sect.  From the summit, one could see the Inner Sect, a view meant to inspire the Outer Sect disciples.</p><p>From time to time, cheers erupted from the mountaintop.</p><p>This was the final match, deciding the ultimate victor.</p><p>Outer Sect disciples surrounded the arena, cheering for their respective sides.  Even some Inner Sect male disciples came to watch the excitement.</p><p>On the arena.</p><p>One combatant was a youth in yellow robes, unremarkable in appearance and demeanor.</p><p>The other was a beautiful girl in flowing white garments.</p><p>The girl had snow-white skin and a cool temperament.</p><p>She held a spiritual sword, its body as bright and clear as ice, matching her own cold beauty.</p><p>Everyone appreciates beauty.</p><p>Clearly, most people were there to see the girl; their cheers drowned out the river's roar. A few companions tried to encourage the youth, but their voices were barely audible, so they gave up.</p><p>"Go, Sister Lu!"</p><p>"Take him down!"</p><p>"I bet that kid can't last five moves against Sister Lu."</p><p>"Three at most…"</p><p>…</p><p>The protective barrier around the arena couldn't block the sound.</p><p>The youth was lost in the cacophony, alone and helpless, clutching a blackened fire poker, looking rather pathetic.</p><p>The girl showed no sign of smugness. Her lips parted slightly.  "Brother Zhang, I didn't expect you to be my final opponent. Please, enlighten me!"</p><p>The youth seemed distracted, his eyes vacant.</p><p>He appeared overwhelmed by the spectacle.</p><p>The girl frowned.</p><p>Then, the Outer Sect attendant announced the start of the match.</p><p>The clever girl noticed her opponent's strange state, but her resolve was firm. She would give her all, regardless of the opponent!</p><p>The girl gestured with her right hand, and her spiritual sword flew into the air.</p><p>The sword's energy vibrated, her clothes billowed, captivating the onlookers, cheers ringing out across the Outer Sect.</p><p>In contrast, the youth, as if waking from a dream, hastily raised his blackened fire poker.</p><p>This elicited a wave of laughter.</p><p>It was hard to imagine anyone crafting such an unsightly magical artifact. Yet, the youth had used it to win every match, reaching the final round.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The spiritual sword struck mercilessly, transforming into a blue sword beam.</p><p>Provoked by the sword beam, the fire poker emitted a brilliant green light, shooting into the sky in an instant.</p><p>Green and blue light collided with a violent clash.</p><p>A thunderous roar filled the air, blurring the figures of both combatants. The crisscrossing green and blue light spread toward the edge of the arena, causing the protective barrier to tremble repeatedly.</p><p>The spectators closest to the barrier recoiled in alarm, only relaxing when they saw the barrier remained intact, their faces filled with surprise at the power of the initial exchange.</p><p>The girl was also surprised.  The fire poker not only held its own against her spiritual sword but also seemed to possess a strange suction, disrupting her spiritual energy, causing it to churn.</p><p>The youth's cultivation was clearly a level below hers.</p><p>This battle couldn't be lost!</p><p>The girl gritted her teeth, no longer hesitating.  She immediately activated a recently mastered secret technique.</p><p>"Divine Sword, Control Thunder!"</p><p>With a cry, the spiritual sword let out a long hum. The blue light flashed, suddenly transforming into a pillar of light that struck down at the youth with incredible power!</p><p>"What! Junior Sister Lu has already mastered Divine Sword, Control Thunder!"</p><p>"As expected of a genius!"</p><p>…</p><p>The crowd gasped.</p><p>The light pillar resembled a thunderbolt, its momentum breathtaking, as if it would cleave the mountain.</p><p>Of course, it didn't possess the power of actual thunder, nor was it a sound of thunder from the sword's energy. It was a treasured sword technique of Qingyang Temple. For a girl of her cultivation to master this technique, she was a true swordsmanship genius.</p><p>Outside the arena, Bai Hanqiu looked at the girl with approval, while an attendant beside her watched the youth with a tense expression, his eyes showing a hint of expectation.</p><p>Before the youth, there was nothing but the fire poker.</p><p>His face contorted, blood flowing from his orifices, he gripped the fire poker. A circular crystal on the end of the blackened fire poker faintly glowed red, and he hurled it towards the light pillar.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A thunderous explosion.</p><p>The arena trembled violently.</p><p>The blue and green light were nearly indistinguishable.</p><p>The crowd fell silent, their faces tense as they watched the arena.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>Suddenly, the blue light dimmed, and the girl flew backward.  Her face was pale, her breathing weak, her spiritual energy almost depleted. She barely managed to steady herself.</p><p>The boy, however, spat blood and fell from the arena like a rag doll.</p><p>"Junior Sister Lu wins!"</p><p>After a brief silence, the crowd cheered excitedly.</p><p>But the girl remained silent, standing there, staring blankly at the boy.</p><p>"Pathetic!"</p><p>The attendant, heartbroken, could clearly see that the boy had faltered at the last moment.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu's expression, however, was not unkind.</p><p>Just as she was about to speak, she suddenly saw a refined figure in the crowd nod slightly at her. Thinking she had imagined it, she quickly looked again.</p><p>After whispering a few words to the attendant, Bai Hanqiu, ignoring the stares of her fellow disciples, transformed into a streak of light and flew into the inner sect.  Seeing Qin Sang strolling through the mountains, she respectfully followed.  "Disciple greets Master. Did Master also watch the disciples' competition?"</p><p>"The youthful exuberance of a bygone era.  I'm indulging in a little nostalgia,"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled.</p><p>In truth, he had encountered too many setbacks in his early cultivation to have the opportunity to participate in the sect's competition.  Even after joining Shao Hua Mountain, he had avoided such events whenever possible.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang didn't blame her, Bai Hanqiu breathed a sigh of relief and made small talk.  "That male disciple, I don't know where he obtained his good fortune, but the artifact he wielded seemed to have quite a history. Senior Brother Tan said it has the potential to become a high-level treasure..."</p><p>"It's a blood-forged, malevolent artifact, but don't worry about it.  Artifacts have no inherent good or evil; it all depends on the wielder's character."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded unconcernedly, understanding Bai Hanqiu's apprehension.  He had been in seclusion for many years, and Bai Hanqiu's cultivation hadn't progressed much. It seemed she had given up on the path of cultivation.  This was Bai Hanqiu's choice, and Qin Sang wouldn't interfere.</p><p>Changing the subject, Qin Sang asked, "The Han family has relocated from Da Sui?"</p><p>Bai Hanqiu nodded repeatedly, reporting to Qin Sang.</p><p>Da Sui was the birthplace of the Green Sheep Temple. Jiang Xueshi, understanding the situation, ordered the Han Manor to relocate, ceding Da Sui and a large surrounding territory to the Green Sheep Temple.</p><p>Tan Yi'en, knowing the significance of Da Sui to Qin Sang, stationed an attendant there, designating Mount Chao Sheng as a sacred site.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu became the current head of the Bai family.</p><p>The Bai family suddenly transformed into a cultivator family.</p><p>However, the Qin family remained the imperial family of Da Sui, enjoying great prosperity, though sadly lacking descendants with cultivation talent.  Any offspring born with spiritual roots were immediately brought to the Green Sheep Temple for training.</p>
