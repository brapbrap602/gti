<h1>Chapter 889: The Dongming Island Dharma Assembly</h1><p>Chapter 889: The Dongming Island Dharma Assembly</p><p>Everyone fell silent, not daring to say much, and dispersed.</p><p>Huasheng was the last to leave.</p><p>“Forbidden area? Is it an openly declared forbidden area, or a place sealed away from the world?”</p><p>He mused to himself, feeling that the secrets involved in Douniu Peak were becoming increasingly profound. The seemingly fearful attitude of the Lan Dou Sect towards it made him even more curious about the true teachings of Douniu Peak.</p><p>Returning to his stone chamber, he refined the spiritual materials for the day, then left the stone hall and returned to his cave to continue refining the Yin-Yang Armor.  The next morning, he flew towards a mountain peak in Lan Dou Sect resembling a pagoda.</p><p>The mountain was covered in wooden halls, a place where the sect's scriptures were treasured.</p><p>Passing through areas where low-level disciples were active, he simply greeted those he knew and continued flying towards the mountaintop without stopping.</p><p>He entered the mountain, paid the required spirit stones, and began to browse the scriptures.</p><p>He frequently visited this mountain over the next few days.</p><p>New disciples could only access the first level of the tower’s scriptures.  While there were many previously unknown secrets of the Canglang Sea, he did not find what he was truly searching for.</p><p>Closing a book, Huasheng looked thoughtful. “It seems I must quickly refine the Yin-Yang Armor and become a true disciple of Yin-Yang Peak. Only true disciples are allowed to enter those forbidden areas of the sect. Fortunately, the standard for accepting true disciples on Yin-Yang Peak isn't foundation establishment.  All that's needed is to successfully refine the Yin-Yang Armor, proving that one has the talent to cultivate the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique*. Otherwise, even if I'm confident I can reach the thirteenth level of Qi Refinement and establish my foundation within a year or two, that speed is far too astonishing. It would certainly attract unwanted attention…”</p><p>Considering this, Huasheng decided to leave and return to his cave to concentrate on refining the Yin-Yang Armor.</p><p>His cultivation speed was in no way slower than those talented new disciples. As time went on, the Yin-Yang energy condensing on his body increased, gradually forming the outline of armor.</p><p>That day, Huasheng suddenly received a message from a senior brother: someone was looking for him outside the sect.</p><p>After sending the message, the senior brother had an ambiguous smile on his face.</p><p>“Huasheng has had almost no contact with cultivators outside the sect. Who would be looking for me? Could it be…?”</p><p>Huasheng's heart stirred. He flew outside the sect gates and saw Fang Ting standing there.</p><p>“Brother Zhang!”</p><p>Seeing Huasheng, Fang Ting's eyes lit up, and she waved vigorously.  When Huasheng landed before her, she composed herself, and somewhat timidly stammered, “Brother Zhang, I'm sorry, I didn’t know Master would…”</p><p>Huasheng waved his hand. “Junior Sister, you needn't say that. I know you meant well! Besides, Senior Chen may not have been targeting me. Perhaps he was planning to arrange a good position for me, but it was interrupted by Grandmaster Huayang’s sudden arrival…”</p><p>Given the relationship between Lan Dou Sect and Yanmiao Pavilion, addressing each other as senior and junior siblings was not inappropriate.</p><p>“Brother, you don’t blame me! That’s great!”</p><p>Fang Ting felt a huge weight lift from her shoulders, sighing in relief.  She rejoiced, “I was afraid you’d misunderstand me, so I hesitated for so long. Otherwise, I would have come to visit you much sooner!”</p><p>“Zhang is not an unreasonable person,” Huasheng smiled faintly. “However, Junior Sister, did you ask Senior Chen for permission to come here?”</p><p>Fang Ting pouted. “Brother, you’re still upset with Master, but it’s understandable. You’ll understand later; Master isn’t a bad person!”</p><p>At this point, Fang Ting lowered her voice, pointed to Lan Dou Sect, and mysteriously said, “Master has been fuming ever since he returned. He’s currently in seclusion, vowing to break through to the mid-stage of Core Formation…”</p><p>Huasheng suddenly understood. Anyone who had experienced the humiliation at the Yanmiao Pavilion’s ancestral hall would find it hard to let go.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Chen's sect couldn't possibly be stronger than Old Daoist Huayang, so he could only strive for self-improvement, hoping to surpass him in cultivation and have a chance to avenge the humiliation.</p><p>Seeing that Huasheng didn't seem to mind the past incident, Fang Ting regained her usual demeanor.</p><p>Huasheng took her into the sect and gave her a tour, learning from her that Senior Chen had long since taken Fang Ting as a disciple.</p><p>However, she had been unaware of Senior Chen's true identity until she joined Yanmiao Pavilion.</p><p>Finally sending off the reluctant Fang Ting, Huasheng sighed in relief.</p><p>“This girl holds a high position in Yanmiao Pavilion, and Old Ghost Chen is so protective of her.  Probably few of her peers in the sect dare to approach her, so she considers Huasheng a friend. Playing this role is quite troublesome; I have to be careful with everyone I meet.”</p><p>Find the true Dou Niu Peak teachings and leave as soon as possible. That's the right way.  Once I solve the third challenge of the *Sky Demon Refining* technique, my true body can find a safe cave to cultivate for decades, waiting for the Qi Sha Hall to open…" the avatar muttered to himself.</p><p>Though still some distance from truly condensing the Yin-Yang Armor, after some thought, the avatar decided to visit Master Yang.  He headed straight for Yin-Yang Peak, quickly arriving at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The spiritual energy here was several times denser than at Jade Finger Peak, clearly one of the sect's best spiritual veins.</p><p>The avatar stopped at the foot of the mountain, produced a token, and activated the inscription with his spiritual energy.</p><p>Soon, a streak of light appeared from the mountain, revealing the figure of an acolyte.</p><p>His expression was unfriendly, seemingly displeased by the avatar's intrusion. He scolded, "You've only recently joined, yet you don't diligently cultivate but wander around instead?"</p><p>The avatar showed fear, timidly replying, "With respect, Master Yang, I've just condensed the initial form of the Yin-Yang Armor, but I've hit a bottleneck for days now, and I have some questions I'd like to ask the Master…"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Hearing the avatar's words, the acolyte's anger subsided, replaced by surprise.  "You've already condensed the initial form of the Yin-Yang Armor? Let me see!"</p><p>As instructed, the avatar manipulated his spiritual energy. Grey energy swirled around his body, barely coalescing into the faint shape of armor.</p><p>While not the fastest in the Yin-Yang lineage, his controlled condensation speed was among the best.</p><p>Seeing the nascent armor, the acolyte's surprise deepened. "I underestimated your talent. This is even better than my achievement back then! At this rate… you might even make it to the Dong Ming Island Assembly."</p><p>The acolyte fell silent, his final words barely audible, almost a mutter to himself.</p><p>The avatar still caught a few words, though. This Dong Ming Island Assembly was entirely new to him.</p><p>The acolyte raised his eyelids and said gravely, "Condensing the Yin-Yang Armor is a talent test. Once the initial form appears, one can begin cultivating the technique. Your rapid progress shows exceptional talent; further effort is unnecessary.  Even granting you the true teachings now is justifiable.  The Master said to act decisively in urgent situations, and with the current manpower shortage, strict adherence to tradition isn't necessary…"</p>
