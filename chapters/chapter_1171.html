<h1>Chapter 1163: Cleansing the Sect</h1><p>*Creak!*</p><p>The grand hall doors slowly parted to either side, and a figure emerged from within.  </p><p>This person wore a mask, their aura obscure and difficult to discern.  </p><p>For the past month, Qin Sang had been wandering near the Verdant Sun Demon Sect. As he had expected, the sect had sealed its gates, and he hadn’t seen any core disciples. Gathering information had proven difficult.  </p><p>Suddenly, someone strode out of the sect leader’s hall, spouting arrogant words.  </p><p>Both sides were stunned.  </p><p>When Mei Gu and Zhao Shanran caught sight of the newcomer, their eyes widened in shock as they stared at the iron ring on the person’s finger, their faces filled with disbelief.  </p><p>Lu Xing also noticed the iron ring on Qin Sang’s hand.  </p><p>A look of suspicion crossed his face as he glanced at Mei Gu and Zhao Shanran, then sneered, “That old fool has been missing for over a hundred years. His corpse has long since turned to bones, and you dare to find someone to impersonate him? Do you take the entire Blazing Flame Sect for fools?”  </p><p>Mei Gu, however, ignored Lu Xing. She hurried forward, still in disbelief, her voice trembling, “Are you truly… the Sect Leader?”  </p><p>“Mei Gu, how much do you remember of what I told you before I left?” Qin Sang smiled at her, casually mentioning a few phrases.  </p><p>“This disciple has remembered every word, never daring to forget a single one!” Mei Gu wept tears of joy.  </p><p>“The act is quite convincing…” Lu Xing muttered, his voice laced with suspicion and sarcasm. But before he could continue, Sect Leader Dong stopped him, causing Lu Xing to startle.  </p><p>Sect Leader Dong frowned as he observed Qin Sang, a sense of foreboding rising within him. As a late-stage Golden Core expert, he couldn’t see through this person’s true strength, yet he could faintly sense a thread of threat emanating from them.  </p><p>Suddenly, Sect Leader Dong felt a gust of wind rush toward him, and his vision blurred.  </p><p>“Not good!” Sect Leader Dong shouted, “Be careful!”  </p><p>His reaction wasn’t slow. He was about to summon his lifebound treasure when he noticed a figure suddenly appear beside him. With a cry of alarm, he hastily retreated.  </p><p>Lu Xing’s face was filled with terror. He had thought the other party was an imposter, but he never expected their movement to be so ghostly, appearing before him in an instant.  </p><p>“What use is there in keeping such a traitorous scoundrel alive?” Qin Sang coldly snorted, then struck out with a palm toward Lu Xing’s forehead.  </p><p>To Lu Xing, the seemingly light palm strike felt like a thousand strikes, as if the surrounding space had been sealed off, leaving him no room to escape. To his horror, he found that no matter how he tried to dodge, he couldn’t avoid the blow.  </p><p>“Ah!” Lu Xing let out a desperate roar, his body erupting with red light. His lifebound treasure, the Seven Sun Ruler, flew out from within him, hastily countering the attack.  </p><p>The Seven Sun Ruler surged with fiery energy, forming waves of flame that rushed toward Qin Sang’s palm. But Qin Sang showed no intention of holding back, his palm continuing its relentless descent.  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>A dull thud echoed.  </p><p>The Seven Sun Ruler was the first to suffer.  </p><p>The treasure’s glow dimmed, emitting a mournful cry as its fiery energy scattered, forced back by the sheer force of the palm strike!  </p><p>In the next moment, the palm, still carrying the Seven Sun Ruler, struck Lu Xing’s forehead.  </p><p>Lu Xing’s pupils dilated as he stood frozen in place.  </p><p>Then, as if an invisible flame had ignited, his entire body began to turn to ash, starting from the top of his head and gradually disintegrating into dust, scattering with the wind.  </p><p>In the end, not a trace of him remained.  </p><p>Within the Blazing Flame Sect, silence reigned.  </p><p>Qin Sang casually tossed the Seven Sun Ruler to Zhao Shanran, then turned with a smile to Sect Leader Dong, cupping his hands slightly. “Fellow Daoist Dong, I’ve been busy establishing my sect here and haven’t had the chance to pay you a visit. My apologies.”  </p><p>Qin Sang didn’t want to draw the attention of the Verdant Sun Demon Sect, so he had only used the level of true essence equivalent to a late-stage Golden Core cultivator.  </p><p>However, his physical body was far too powerful. Even with just his bare hand, Lu Xing had no hope of harming him, which was why he had displayed such a terrifying scene before everyone.  </p><p>Sect Leader Dong, as if waking from a dream, shuddered and retreated dozens of feet with Elder Wu, both shocked by Qin Sang’s display.  </p><p>He knew that if he had personally attacked, he could have killed Lu Xing, but never so effortlessly. Even if this person had been hiding in the sect leader’s hall, plotting for a long time, such strength was still too terrifying.  </p><p>Sect Leader Dong steadied himself, secretly on guard, and confirmed that Qin Sang was only at the late-stage Golden Core level. “Fellow Daoist Lu had already been expelled from the Blazing Flame Sect by Acting Sect Leader Mei and had agreed to become a guest elder of my Shadow Spring Sect. It’s not appropriate for you to kill him in front of us.”  </p><p>At first, he suspected that this person might be a Nascent Soul old monster, but he quickly dismissed the idea.  </p><p>If a Nascent Soul ancestor had been present, it wouldn’t have been just Lu Xing who died.  </p><p>“Mei Gu is merely the acting sect leader. I have not yet spoken, so Lu Xing remains a disciple of the Blazing Flame Sect. I was merely cleansing my sect. Are you trying to interfere in the affairs of the Blazing Flame Sect?” Qin Sang said meaningfully.  </p><p>“Not at all, not at all…” Sect Leader Dong forced a dry laugh. “In that case, I must have misunderstood… May I ask for your Daoist title?”  </p><p>“This old man’s Daoist title is Clear Breeze,” Qin Sang said, gesturing toward the foot of the mountain. “I’ve just returned from a long journey, and there are many sect matters to attend to. It’s inconvenient at the moment, but I’ll invite you all to visit another day.”  </p><p>Mei Gu’s eyes widened at his words.  </p><p>She remembered that a disciple had once told her about encountering an old acquaintance of hers, whose Daoist title was Clear Breeze.  </p><p>Sect Leader Dong didn’t take offense, nodding repeatedly. “Of course, of course. I’ll take my leave now and not disturb Fellow Daoist Clear Breeze any further.”  </p><p>As he turned away, his expression instantly darkened.  </p><p>“Also, Mei Gu will lead half of the disciples to meet with you in the coming days,” Qin Sang stated firmly.  </p><p>Sect Leader Dong’s expression stiffened, but he nodded and hurried down the mountain without looking back, his retreating figure appearing exceptionally disheveled.  </p><p>Qin Sang turned around to find all the Blazing Flame Sect disciples staring at him in stunned silence.  </p><p>Even Mei Gu felt as if she were dreaming, unable to believe that the long-missing sect leader had returned, his power so overwhelming that he had instantly obliterated Lu Xing and forced Sect Leader Dong to retreat.  </p><p>“Disciples pay respects to the Sect Leader!” Mei Gu knelt in reverence.  </p><p>“We pay respects to the Sect Leader!” All the disciples shouted in unison, dropping to their knees, their faces filled with joy and genuine respect.  </p><p>Zhao Shanran tightly gripped the Seven Sun Ruler, his hands and voice trembling.  </p><p>The hearts of the people were now aligned.  </p><p>Qin Sang nodded and walked toward the grand hall, saying as he went, “Rise. The sect’s rules remain unchanged. Mei Gu will continue to act as your sect leader. Mei Gu, follow me. Zhao Shanran and the late-stage Foundation Establishment disciples, stay behind.”  </p><p>“Yes!”  </p><p>…  </p><p>After arranging for the others, Mei Gu, suppressing her excitement, entered the sect leader’s hall and was once again stunned.  </p><p>Inside the hall, Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, gazing up at a portrait.  </p><p>It was the same pose as in the portrait.  </p><p>The portrait was well-crafted, but it couldn’t capture even a fraction of Qin Sang’s true presence, appearing thin and pale in comparison.  </p><p>“A Nascent Soul ancestor…” Mei Gu murmured, her mind blank.  </p><p>Today, she had been shocked time and time again, thinking she had grown numb to it.  </p><p>But at this moment, her mind was completely empty, utterly bewildered.  </p><p>“You’ve done well over the years,” Qin Sang turned around, his expression filled with approval.  </p><p>Mei Gu stared at Qin Sang, then suddenly burst into tears. Years of grievances and burdens finally found release. From now on, she would no longer have to bear everything alone—she had someone to rely on.</p>
