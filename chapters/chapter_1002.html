<h1>Chapter 994: The Seed of the Fire Curse</h1><p>Qin Sang cautiously investigated, then plunged into the deep sea.</p><p>The source of the light pillar was on the seabed.  It wasn't calm here either; the force of the storm reached down, creating strong currents, making it as dangerous as the surface.</p><p>Qin Sang managed to stabilize himself and looked towards the source.</p><p>The strange light was blinding.</p><p>Using his celestial eye ability, Qin Sang saw a large curtain beyond the light, and behind the curtain lay a desolate land with several ancient temples.</p><p>He surveyed the scene behind the curtain, finding it deathly still, devoid of life.</p><p>Everything was clearly visible; there were no apparent dangers.</p><p>The curtain itself was the ancient restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang unexpectedly found that the curtain was incomplete, broken in one corner, as if forcefully breached.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately moved to the curtain.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly exerted its full power.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had never seen this type of ancient restriction, with the Butterfly's help, he gradually analyzed its power and eventually found a way to break it.</p><p>Using the existing break, Qin Sang felt confident he could get through.</p><p>He didn't rush, waiting a while to confirm there were no hidden dangers behind the curtain before attempting to break the restriction.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>Six magic banners formed an array, and the Nine Netherworld Magic Fire formed a spear, striking hard at the corner of the ancient restriction.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The curtain remained unmoved.</p><p>The light pillar only rippled slightly.</p><p>But the area hit by the spear showed a change.</p><p>There were already cracks there, and the spear precisely hit one, causing that section of the curtain to glow more brightly, with strange phenomena appearing.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly spread its wings, its wings manifesting a pair of real celestial eyes, fixed on the curtain.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity,</p><p>Qin Sang rapidly changed his hand seals, sending streams of restriction-breaking energy into the curtain.</p><p>His first few attempts failed.</p><p>After several refinements, Qin Sang finally succeeded.</p><p>The crack in the corner of the curtain suddenly dimmed, Qin Sang flashed through the crack and entered the area behind the curtain.</p><p>The space here wasn't large.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his spirit sword and magic banners for protection, quickly circled the area, and came before the temples, discovering that the restrictions here also showed signs of being broken.</p><p>"Empty!"</p><p>Bai suddenly spoke.</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up. "Friend Bai, you've recovered?"</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Bai emerged from the corpse puppet bag, nodding.  "By tomorrow, I should be able to barely break the fire curse."</p><p>He surveyed the surroundings. "I didn't expect you to find this secret realm! However, these restrictions seem to have been broken; it's been visited before…"</p><p>"There are countless powerful ancestors from the Human and Witch clans, many must have entered the storm zone to explore.  It's normal for it to have been visited. As long as it's safe enough to shelter us for a while, I'll be satisfied. Since we started fleeing, my physical and mental strength are almost exhausted, I've been persevering solely on willpower."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, his tone revealing deep fatigue.</p><p>"I haven't been able to thank you properly, Friend Bai! Without your help, I would have already perished."</p><p>Qin Sang's gratitude was sincere as he bowed to Bai.</p><p>Bai looked at Qin Sang deeply. "To find a glimmer of hope in a desperate situation, to escape from a Yuan Ying expert… most of the credit goes to you! Anyone else, even with my help, would have been helpless."</p><p>The two briefly discussed and each chose a temple to rest and recover.</p><p>Qin Sang desperately wanted to sleep, but it wasn't the time.</p><p>He sat in meditation, his mind empty.</p><p>After a few hours, Qin Sang recovered some of his energy, left the temple, and looked up at the curtain above.</p><p>The strange phenomena from the ancient restriction were too conspicuous.</p><p>Qin Sang flew close to the curtain and studied it for a long time, finally finding a way to hide the light pillar's strange phenomena and reinforce the damaged part of the curtain.</p><p>When he finished, Bai had been waiting for some time.</p><p>Inside the temple,</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the magic fire.</p><p>He had learned the magic fire curse seal technique from Bai, and they worked together to break the fire curse.</p><p>Bai's target was the fire curse in Qin Sang's limbs; the deeper curses in his inner organs and Purple Mansion were for Qin Sang himself to deal with.</p><p>It seemed that Old Devil Mu had given up, as the fire curse showed no signs of activity.</p><p>The speed of removing the curse was slow, but progress was smooth.</p><p>During a break,</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, then suddenly said to Bai, "What about leaving one fire curse behind, to pinpoint Old Devil Mu's location, or lure him here?"</p><p>Bai was startled. "You wouldn't be thinking…"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, then said, "I suspect Old Devil Mu might still be looking for me."</p><p>"I underestimated you.  To say you're reckless is an understatement!"</p><p>Bai Lian shook her head. "If Mou Lao Mo only had early Yuan Ying cultivation, with your powerful thunder magic, there might be a 10% chance. But Mou Lao Mo, a cunning old fox, wouldn't easily put himself in danger. If he dares stay in the storm zone, he must have a trump card to ensure his survival, or even to counterattack. Even if we were rested and at our peak, it would be difficult to win against him."</p><p>"Don't worry, I was just thinking aloud..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. He understood perfectly. The difference in their strength was too great; schemes and tricks wouldn't work.</p><p>"However..."</p><p>Bai's tone changed, and she mused, "Your words gave me an idea.  Cursed magic is a double-edged sword. I can try to manipulate the fire curse, leaving behind a seed.  Later, when your strength surpasses his, you can hunt him down – it's not impossible."</p><p>Pausing slightly, Bai looked at Qin Sang. "If the Winter Nether Flame is as powerful as you say, after subduing it, Mou Lao Mo's strength will likely surpass his peers, second only to late Yuan Ying cultivators. Revenge will be extremely difficult... If you feel the chance is slim, it's better to let go of the thought to avoid it becoming a demon in your heart."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.  Even if Mou Lao Mo stopped improving, it was uncertain when he himself would break through to mid-Yuan Ying.  By then, he might already have left the Canglang Sea. And if Mou Lao Mo became a powerful cultivator, revenge would be even more hopeless.</p><p>Qin Sang had suffered heavy losses from Mou Lao Mo's relentless pursuit. He had only a few high-grade spirit stones left, and most of his pills were consumed.  Furthermore, the self-destruction of his avatars and the loss of his two-headed beast were like severing his own arms, greatly weakening him.  Creating new avatars would take at least several decades.  And any new beasts he captured would be inferior in spirit and strength to the two-headed one.</p><p>What hurt Qin Sang most was the loss of three drops of the Three Lights Jade Liquid!</p><p>This anger was hard to swallow, but he had to endure. He had to bide his time.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled and resolutely said, "Please, Senior Bai, leave the fire curse seed! I've been through many ups and downs; I've experienced similar situations before.  I'm not easily affected by such things."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Bai said gravely, "Refining the fire curse seed, and ensuring Mou Lao Mo doesn't notice it... I need to think carefully about this."</p>
