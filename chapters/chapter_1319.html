<h1>Chapter 1311: The Millennium Pact</h1><p>Two months later.</p><p>Within the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>A dozen figures streaked across the sky.</p><p>These individuals moved with such exquisite techniques that the restrictive formations within the Heavenly Scar seemed to pose no obstacle to them. The creatures inhabiting the Heavenly Scar trembled in fear, sensing the overwhelming pressure emanating from these figures, and hid in their nests, shivering.</p><p>If anyone were to witness these figures, they would undoubtedly be astonished, for they were all renowned figures from the Northern Star Realm.</p><p>The True Lord Canghong from the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>The Sect Master of the Heavenly Alliance, Daoist Zhenyi.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord from the Frost Domain, Qin Sang, and others.</p><p>The foremost expert of the demon race, the Feather King.</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Lu from the desert.</p><p>...</p><p>Their destination was the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>Experts from various regions traveled together, and the once-tense atmosphere had dissipated.</p><p>With the news of the demise of Elder Tianzheng spreading, the morale of the Abyss of Sin had plummeted further. After several rounds of negotiations, they had agreed to the harsh terms set by the alliance of the two domains.</p><p>A month ago, the Frost Domain, the Heavenly Alliance, and the Abyss of Sin had sworn an oath before the city of Yu, establishing a millennium-long pact, marking the official end of a war that had lasted nearly two hundred years.</p><p>The Heavenly Demon Hills and the desert forces had also attended the ceremony.</p><p>The Northern Star Realm had finally welcomed a rare period of peace!</p><p>After two centuries of turmoil that had nearly engulfed the entire Northern Star Realm, the moment the stone monument bearing the pact was erected, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Yet, no one dared to let their guard down.</p><p>The Demon Lord Ye, who had slaughtered Nascent Soul cultivators and fled into the Palace of Sinful Deities, had become the common enemy of all factions. This was precisely why they had gathered to enter the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>The Palace of Sinful Deities and the Purple Micro Palace held too many secrets, and the ambitions of the Demon Lord Ye were vast. After deliberation, Daoist Zhenyi and others concluded that the Demon Lord Ye would surely be prepared for a joint attack from the three domains, making it uncertain whether they could eliminate him. To be cautious, they decided to invite the Heavenly Demon Hills and the desert cultivators to join them in entering the Palace of Sinful Deities next time to surround and kill the Demon Lord Ye!</p><p>Everyone knew that no single individual could match the Demon Lord Ye, and thus, no one could monopolize the secrets. No matter how important the secrets were, if they couldn't kill him, it would all be for naught.</p><p>When the time came, the various factions would share the secrets, and how much they could achieve would depend on their individual capabilities.</p><p>There was another reason why it was difficult to exclude them.</p><p>There was an ancient pact between the Frost Domain and the Heavenly Demon Hills concerning the Purple Micro Palace. This time, they had entered through the Immortal Gate of the Palace of Sinful Deities, which was unusual, and they owed the Heavenly Demon Hills an explanation.</p><p>During the war, the Heavenly Demon Hills had consistently sent demon soldiers to aid them. They couldn't simply turn their backs on them now that the situation had improved.</p><p>Moreover, during the peace talks with the desert forces, the Palace of Sinful Deities had promised to open the Abyssal Ruins and the Palace of Sinful Deities to them, which was why the desert forces had readily accepted.</p><p>For the sake of the Demon Lord Ye, the entire Northern Star Realm had united as never before.</p><p>Qin Sang, of course, strongly advocated for cooperation. He did not want a Demon Lord to emerge in the Northern Star Realm. The Azure Wave Sea had first seen the machinations of a Divine Transformation cultivator, followed by the deaths of so many top experts, and they had barely managed to seal the Demon Lord.</p><p>The Frost Domain did not have the capability to seal a Demon Lord; they could only stop the Demon Lord Ye before he acted.</p><p>As a precaution, Qin Sang ordered Fat Chicken and the others to continue searching for a suitable cave dwelling overseas. He also postponed the founding of the Green Goat Temple once again.</p><p>He would make further plans after emerging from the Purple Micro Palace next time.</p><p>Although the spoils Qin Sang had received were more than enough to support the development of a sect.</p><p>This time, the Abyss of Sin's trump cards had been exposed, and they had been forced to make continuous concessions in the face of the aggressive alliance of the two domains, paying a heavy price—truly a significant loss.</p><p>The Abyss of Sin had offered the interests of the Demon Lord Ye and the deceased Nascent Soul cultivators as compensation for the previous losses of the two-domain alliance, but the appetites of Nascent Soul cultivators were not easily satisfied.</p><p>For instance, Qu Huan had long coveted the Yellow Luo Vine, a treasure of the Star Constellation Sect.</p><p>As a result, True Lord Canghong and the others had to reluctantly part with their treasured rare artifacts. Even though it didn't cripple them, it was close to their limit, and they would have to tighten their belts for some time.</p><p>They could only hope that the spoils obtained from eliminating the Demon Lord Ye would make up for their losses.</p><p>Qin Sang's achievements stood out even among the top experts, earning him the right to choose from the spoils.</p><p>These treasures were all rare and dazzling, including peculiar magical artifacts, ancient treasures passed down from antiquity, and various precious spiritual materials and herbs.</p><p>Qin Sang was reluctant to part with any of them, but after careful consideration, he decided to stick to his original plan. He shifted his gaze from the ancient treasures to the spiritual materials.</p><p>In the end, he selected rare spiritual materials such as the Flame Gui and Winged Fire Liquid.</p><p>Without exception, all were fire-attribute spiritual items.</p><p>Their value, being treasured by Nascent Soul cultivators, was self-evident.</p><p>They were extremely difficult to find under normal circumstances.</p><p>Those old fellows would never part with them easily.</p><p>Qin Sang was preparing to refine a magical artifact to collect the Southern Brightness Fire, and he happened to be lacking in precious spiritual materials. Obtaining so many this time was a pleasant surprise, and he thought to himself that his efforts had not been in vain.</p><p>After a trip to the Void Spirit Sect to improve his artifact refining skills, he could begin the refining process.</p><p>"What is Fellow Daoist Qin thinking about?"</p><p>Qin Sang was deep in thought when someone's voice startled him. He turned to see the cultivator surnamed Lu.</p><p>He now knew that this person's name was Lu Boyuan.</p><p>After the battle at the Abyssal Ruins, Lu Boyuan had been severely injured, and the Cold Lizard had self-destructed its body. Qin Sang hadn't seen him since.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, "Nothing much, just thinking about the Demon Lord Ye. When the Purple Micro Palace emerges next time, it would be best not to involve low-level cultivators."</p><p>If another ancient demon were to be released, cultivators below the Nascent Soul level would be of no help and would only serve as offerings.</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>"That makes sense. Fellow Daoist Qin is very thoughtful."</p><p>...</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang's suggestion, the others also nodded, and the matter was settled with a few words.</p><p>"I didn't have a chance to ask earlier, but how is Fellow Daoist Cold Lizard recovering?"</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his pace to walk alongside Lu Boyuan.</p><p>Lu Boyuan sighed softly, a bitter smile appearing at the corner of his mouth, "Fellow Daoist Cold Lizard is severely injured, and recovery will be difficult. I can only seek alternative methods..."</p><p>Before he could finish, there was a rustling in his sleeve, and a blue ice lizard, about the length of a hand, crawled out. It looked up at Qin Sang and spoke in a human voice, "Fellow Daoist Qin, it's been many years. I never expected to hear news of you again, and to find that you have become a Nascent Soul cultivator among humans. Fellow Daoist Lu and I were stunned for quite a while."</p><p>Qin Sang was quite surprised.</p><p>The aura of the ice lizard was obscure, and he couldn't tell how much of its strength it had recovered. It seemed as though it had possessed the body of another ice lizard.</p><p>Hearing the Cold Lizard's friendly teasing, Qin Sang glanced at the two figures on the periphery—the Feather King and the Snake King.</p><p>The swift resolution of the war among the three domains and the unprecedented alliance of the human race in the Northern Star Realm due to the Demon Lord Ye was something the Feather King had not anticipated.</p><p>For the Heavenly Demon Hills, the unity among humans was not good news, but there was little they could do about it.</p><p>Qin Sang had once disguised himself as a demon king and boldly entered the Ten Thousand Demon City to attend a demon king council. When the demon kings learned of Qin Sang's true identity, they were utterly shocked and furious.</p><p>Every time the Feather King saw Qin Sang, his expression was far from pleasant. Even the Snake King, who had once shared a life-and-death bond with Qin Sang, was now very cold.</p><p>Fortunately, Jingyu acted as a mediator, or else the Thousand Bamboo Sea lineage might not have been able to maintain its position in the Heavenly Demon Hills.</p><p>As long as Jingyu successfully transcended the heavenly tribulation, with the passage of time, the rift could gradually be mended.</p>
