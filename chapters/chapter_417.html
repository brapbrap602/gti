<h1>Chapter 410: Elixir Completion</h1><p>Yun Youzi left in a hurry.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed in Qingyang Market for another half a month. Afterward, he changed his original plan and didn't go to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, returning to his sect, Shaohua Mountain, instead.</p><p>Several more message talismans had appeared in the Returning Dragon Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved them and examined them one by one. When he saw one of them, his expression shifted slightly. He summoned his flying light and flew towards his sect.</p><p>Shaohua Mountain, Main Peak.</p><p>Originally, Sect Leader Yu presided over this peak.</p><p>After the Heavenly March Alliance's strange movements were discovered, Qi Yuanshou was urgently summoned back to the mountain and resided on the Main Peak.</p><p>A streak of light pierced the sky and arrived before Main Peak.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang was very cautious.  His flying light landed at the foot of Main Peak. He then took out a jade box, held it in his palm, and walked up the mountain with hurried steps, arriving in front of the main hall.</p><p>In front of the main hall stood a tall, handsome young man. Judging by his cultivation, he should have recently achieved Foundation Establishment.</p><p>The young man not only looked young but was likely also young in age, indicating great talent.</p><p>Qin Sang had been away from the sect for a long time and didn't recognize these rising stars. Since this person was guarding the main hall, he couldn't be underestimated.  Qin Sang cupped his hands in greeting and said, "Greetings, Junior Brother. I am Qin Sang. I request an audience with Martial Uncle Qi.  Would you kindly inform him?"</p><p>"Are you Senior Brother Qin?"</p><p>The young man seemed to know Qin Sang. A smile immediately appeared on his face as he walked over and returned the greeting. "Gao Yang greets Senior Brother Qin. Master often speaks of Senior Brother Qin, Senior Brother Yu Yangzi, and Senior Brother Mu, praising you all highly. I've long admired you and finally have the honor of meeting Senior Brother Qin today!"</p><p>"You flatter me! You flatter me!"</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously, "Junior Brother Gao, is your master Martial Uncle Qi?"</p><p>Gao Yang nodded, a look of realization dawning on his face. He explained, "Senior Brother Qin has been traveling outside the sect for a long time and may not know. When Master achieved Core Formation, it coincided with my breakthrough to Foundation Establishment, so he took me as his disciple. Thus, I have the fortune to stay by Master's side, listen to his teachings, and share his worries."</p><p>An envious expression appeared on Qin Sang's face. "Junior Brother Gao, it is truly a blessing to be chosen by Martial Uncle Qi as his disciple! When Martial Uncle Qi was stationed at Hanging Skull Pass, Senior Brother Mu and I received much care from him. If Junior Brother Gao encounters any difficulties in the future, feel free to tell me. Although my cultivation is not high, I will do my best to help."</p><p>Gao Yang was overjoyed. "Thank you, Senior Brother Qin!"</p><p>A warm smile appeared on Qin Sang's face, and he began to chat enthusiastically with Gao Yang.</p><p>Among the message talismans from the Returning Dragon Pavilion, one was a letter of congratulations, informing him that Qi Yuanshou had successfully achieved Core Formation a month ago, becoming a Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang's first visit to Hanging Skull Pass was thirty years ago. At that time, Qi Yuanshou was already a False Core realm expert, having been stuck at the bottleneck for a long time.</p><p>It was common for cultivators to be stuck at the False Core realm for their entire lives.</p><p>For thirty years, Qi Yuanshou hadn't been able to break through.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after being summoned back to the sect to handle more complex sect affairs, Qi Yuanshou managed to break through in one fell swoop.</p><p>Senior Brother Qi had transformed into Martial Uncle Qi.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't heard any news before he left, and even Senior Brother Wen, who was in charge of the Dao Sect Peak, was unaware of it.</p><p>Before Core Formation, cultivators needed to enter secluded meditation to refine themselves, often for decades or even longer. Qi Yuanshou was different. Not only did he not enter seclusion, but he continued to handle various matters.  When the opportunity arose, he immediately broke through.</p><p>It was truly enviable.</p><p>Qin Sang was away and missed Qi Yuanshou's Core Formation celebration. Since he happened to be returning to the sect, it was both appropriate and necessary for him to personally bring a congratulatory gift.</p><p>"Senior Brother Qin, Master is in secluded cultivation, and it's unknown when he will emerge. After Master comes out, I will report to him and convey your message. However, Master does not accept congratulatory gifts, so please put it away, Senior Brother Qin."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's unhappy expression, Gao Yang quickly explained, afraid of being misunderstood. "Senior Brother, I assure you, Master refuses gifts from not only you but also other senior brothers and martial uncles."</p><p>Qin Sang was a little surprised. "Is this true?"</p><p>Gao Yang's expression was solemn. "Absolutely true. How would I dare deceive Senior Brother Qin!"</p><p>"Since it's Martial Uncle Qi's rule, I certainly can't break it. It was my presumption."</p><p>Qin Sang had no choice but to put away the jade box.</p><p>Inside the jade box was Cold Gold Ore Essence. Qin Sang hadn't had time to refine it, but it was certainly sufficient as a congratulatory gift.</p><p>While putting away the jade box, Qin Sang took out another item from his storage pouch, a copper ring.</p><p>This top-grade magical artifact was a relic from the man he chased down in the Yin Mountains. It was of good quality but somewhat ordinary in function. Qin Sang had kept it in his storage pouch, as he had no use for it at the moment.</p><p>"Junior Brother Gao, although we've only just met, I feel we are quite compatible. This magical artifact of mine is quite suited to your cultivation technique. I'd like to give it to you for your protection..."</p><p>It was clear that Gao Yang liked the artifact very much, but he didn't dare to accept it, repeatedly refusing.</p><p>Qin Sang urged him.</p><p>Gao Yang was still young and could barely resist.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as the two were going back and forth, Qi Yuanshou's laughter came from the hall. "Gao Yang, don't refuse your Senior Brother Qin's kindness. Accept the gift and bring your Senior Brother Qin in."</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>Gao Yang quickly put away the copper ring and bowed towards the hall. After receiving the order, he turned to Qin Sang and said, "Thank you, Senior Brother Qin! Please follow me."</p><p>Having given away a top-grade magical artifact, Qin Sang was very happy.</p><p>Following Gao Yang into the main hall, he saw that Qi Yuanshou had just emerged from his cave residence.</p><p>"Disciple greets Martial Uncle Qi! Congratulations to Martial Uncle Qi on achieving Core Formation, taking another step closer to the Great Dao!"</p><p>Qin Sang respectfully greeted Qi Yuanshou according to Shaohua Mountain's customs.</p><p>"Mere Core Formation, how dare I speak of the Great Dao?"</p><p>Qi Yuanshou retorted with a smile and pointed to the table. "Qin Sang, we have known each other for many years. There's no need for formalities. Please, have a seat."</p><p>"Thank you, Martial Uncle Qi."</p><p>Qin Sang sat down on half of a chair and poured tea on his own initiative. He didn't dare to probe Qi Yuanshou with his divine sense, but sitting in front of him, he could feel his powerful aura, like facing a mountain.</p><p>Without waiting for Qin Sang to speak, Qi Yuanshou got straight to the point. "Qin Sang, I've learned about some of your matters. Since you've chosen to cultivate the 'Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter' and dedicate yourself to the path of the sword, you need to travel and hone yourself.</p><p>"The sect has selected a group of disciples to be sent to the Cloudmist Great Marsh to guard important locations like mineral veins and medicinal gardens, as well as patrol various areas. The rewards are very generous.</p><p>"However, although the Heavenly March Alliance is restless, the situation hasn't reached a critical point yet. Even if you join the patrols, you won't encounter many opponents.  Staying in those places, unable to leave without permission, may suit others, but it would hinder your cultivation.</p><p>"Therefore, your name was originally on the list, but I took the liberty of removing it, intending to summon you back to the mountain when the war truly begins, so you can enter the killing fields and temper yourself.</p><p>"Since you're back, I wanted to ask for your opinion."</p><p>Qin Sang saw that Qi Yuanshou had no intention of taking him as a disciple, but his words implied a degree of protection.  Qin Sang couldn't help but feel deeply moved. The goodwill he had cultivated in the past had finally borne fruit!</p>
