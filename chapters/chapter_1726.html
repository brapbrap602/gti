<h1>Chapter 1717: Fellow Daoist, Please Wait</h1><p>The ocean surface stretched boundless and vast.</p><p>The demon armies of both sides spread out, engaging in close combat.  The sky and the water were both a dense, oppressive black.  The vast sea had become a battlefield for the two armies, filled with the roar of battle that shook the heavens. Unlike the human wars Qin Sang had experienced, this one was dominated by strange roars and howls, creating an exceptionally chaotic cacophony.</p><p>Gradually, crimson seawater spread from the battlefield, dyeing the surrounding waters into a sea of blood.</p><p>The most striking sight was a colossal whale at the heart of the battle.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage had directly manifested his true form.  Setting aside his profound cultivation, the sheer oppressive presence of his massive Dragon Whale body was unmatched by any other beast.</p><p>Other Dragon Whales, pulling the Sacred Bone, followed behind him. Compared to him, they looked like ninety-nine calves.</p><p>Worthy of being the East Sea's foremost Demon Sage!  Even caged and without utilizing the Sacred Bone, the Dragon Whale Great Sage, relying solely on his own power, rampaged across the battlefield, unmatched and ferocious.</p><p>No Great Sage had yet appeared from the Sacred King Palace's side.</p><p>Those low-level demonic beasts couldn't even approach the Dragon Whale Great Sage's true body. Merely touching the waves stirred by him swept away swathes of them.  The waves carried strange fluctuations, transformed by the Dragon Whale Great Sage's divine abilities. Those with insufficient strength who were struck by them screamed in agony, their bones breaking and tendons snapping.</p><p>However, despite the Dragon Whale Great Sage's relentless assault, the Sacred King Palace's forces somehow maintained their formation.</p><p>Qin Sang did not participate in the battle. He hovered at the edge of the battlefield, his divine sense spread out, observing the changes in Qi within the field.  His gaze passed over the awe-inspiring Dragon Whale Great Sage and landed on the demon soldiers of the Sacred King Palace.</p><p>With the naked eye alone, he couldn't see the full extent of the Sacred King Palace's demon army. It wasn't that their numbers were limitless, but rather that they were concealed by a mysterious, primal yellow light.</p><p>The primal yellow light enveloped the Sacred King Palace's army, thinning towards the edges.  Where they clashed with the rebel army, it resembled a thin layer of yellow mist.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, gazing at the area where the primal yellow light was most concentrated. He vaguely saw the illusory image of a grand palace.</p><p>"Sacred King Palace…"</p><p>Qin Sang silently recited the words in his heart.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, that illusory palace should be the Sacred King Palace, whose prestige shook the East Sea's demon races.  However, what he saw wasn't the true Sacred King Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang had given the Cleansing Pearl, obtained from the remains of the Witch Tribe Nascent Soul cultivator, to the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to refine. Utilizing the spirit control secret art from the *Panhu True Scripture*, he merged with the butterfly. Although the Heaven's Eye Butterfly hadn't reached the Fifth Transformation, it could still display divine abilities close to that realm.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye divine ability could see through illusions.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang could discern that it wasn't a real palace, but an illusory image manifested by the operation of some kind of spirit array.  The Sacred King Palace's demon army relied on this array to withstand the Dragon Whale Great Sage's assault.</p><p>He could see the primal yellow light on the battlefield fluctuating like tides, rising and falling. The Sacred King Palace's momentum surged and receded with the fluctuations.  Each time it swelled, a ring of yellow light would burst forth from each demon soldier, like armor, skillfully neutralizing danger with a certain methodical precision.</p><p>"This array…"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, his brow furrowed in thought.</p><p>The illusory image of the Sacred King Palace appearing here indicated that the true palace wasn't far.  Qin Sang suspected this primal yellow light originated from the Sacred King Palace's protective Immortal Array!</p><p>However, after observing for a while, he felt something was amiss.</p><p>He had learned from the Dragon Whale Great Sage that the Sacred King Palace possessed a protective Immortal Array, though its origins were unknown. Some of the array flags within it were ancient Immortal Flags, possessing immense power.</p><p>When hunting the ferocious beast, the Azure Fox Saint King had initially intended to use the ancient Immortal Flags.</p><p>Later, after obtaining the Five Elements Crown, which offered the more suitable Great Five Elements Sealing Divine Light and the Buddhist Demon Subduing Grand Formation, he abandoned that plan. Otherwise, Qin Sang would have already witnessed the power of the protective Immortal Array.</p><p>The current array of the Sacred King Palace was undoubtedly strong, but in Qin Sang's eyes, it seemed somewhat unworthy of its reputation.</p><p>"Could it be that because the Azure Fox Saint King isn't personally controlling the array, its power is diminished… or am I mistaken?"</p><p>Unless the Sacred King Palace was deliberately creating a false impression to lure the enemy deeper, concealing some other scheme, these signs were enough for Qin Sang to make a judgment.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the sea chart given to him by the Dragon Whale Great Sage.</p><p>The chart showed that passing through this battlefield would lead into the core territory of the Sacred King Palace. The reason they were able to encircle the Sacred King Palace's demon army here was twofold: their own meticulous planning, and the enemy having little room to retreat.</p><p>Places deemed sacred grounds by the demon race were few and far between in the entire East Sea.</p><p>This area was favored by the Azure Fox Saint King because it was near three sacred grounds, including the East Sea Eye, the foremost sacred ground, holding immense significance for the demon race.  Since it had been occupied by the Azure Fox Saint King, the various races had almost forgotten what the East Sea Eye looked like.</p><p>With the various armies about to reach the gates of the Sacred King Palace, if the Sacred King Palace had the ability to project its protective spirit array here to bolster morale, they would undoubtedly prioritize their strongest Immortal Array.</p><p>Leaving the protective Immortal Array unused…</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King remaining unseen…</p><p>Qin Sang concealed his presence, repeatedly surveying the battlefield. His premonition grew stronger: the Azure Fox Saint King had not only left the East Sea, but had also taken the protective Immortal Array with him!</p><p>Abandoning his foundation and absconding with his treasures, such a decisive move… where could he have gone?</p><p>The pungent smell of blood filled the air.</p><p>The battlefield grew increasingly chaotic.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around and noticed two armies flanking the battlefield.  Those allied forces who had hesitated, seeing the Dragon Whale Great Sage's overwhelming dominance and the absence of the Azure Fox Saint King, finally joined the attack.</p><p>Of course, having delayed for so long, they had no further reason to procrastinate.</p><p>With fresh reinforcements arriving, the Dragon Whale Great Sage's momentum soared.  His roars echoed clearly, like the resounding cries of a dragon, shaking the heavens.</p><p>Even Qin Sang couldn't help but admire, what a magnificent demon!</p><p>With the allied forces united and encircling from multiple sides, the pressure on the Sacred King Palace's demon army more than doubled.  Even relying on the spirit array, they couldn't withstand the elite forces of various races and began to retreat.</p><p>However, the closer they got to the Sacred King Palace, the stronger the array's empowerment became.  The allied forces' victory wouldn't come easily.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless, his gaze fixed on the illusory Sacred King Palace, flickering as he tried to discern something from it.</p><p>However, the Dragon Whale Great Sage was growing impatient.</p><p>As things stood, with the Sacred King Palace army relying on the grand array, even if the allied forces could win, the Dragon Whale clan, bearing the brunt of the attack, would inevitably suffer heavy losses. If the battle dragged on for too long and the sacred grounds were emptied, it would take a considerable amount of time for them to recover.</p><p>With the Azure Fox Saint King nowhere to be seen, he was hesitant to reveal his trump card.</p><p>Before the battle, Qin Sang had promised to help them break the array, yet he remained inactive.</p><p>Amidst the carnage, the Dragon Whale Great Sage repeatedly communicated with Qin Sang through sound transmission. Finally, he couldn't help but ask, "True Monarch, have you discerned any weaknesses in the enemy's formation?"</p><p>"Contact the other commanders.  Follow my instructions!"</p><p>Qin Sang commanded in a deep voice.</p><p>While searching for the Azure Fox Saint King, he hadn't neglected to analyze the array.</p><p>The profoundness of a spirit array manifested differently to cultivators of different realms.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators could initially sense the heavens and earth, and with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's divine ability aiding him, the array naturally wasn't without flaws in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Facing a spirit array of this level, Qin Sang didn't even need to delve into the fundamental source of its power, whether it was Five Elements, Yin and Yang, or something else.</p><p>There was no need for laborious deductions. Sensing the flow of the array's Qi and targeting the points of stagnation was the optimal method for breaking it.</p><p>Qin Sang issued his commands without hesitation.  The Dragon Whale Great Sage, instead of being angered, was overjoyed.  He immediately transmitted the message to the commanders of the various armies, using himself as a relay to coordinate the entire army.</p><p>"Zhen position!"</p><p>The next moment, a shout reached their ears.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage slammed against the seawater, relaying the command.  He himself, carrying a thousand-foot wave, soared into the air. Under the astonished gazes of countless demonic beasts, the giant whale thrashed its tail, its gaping maw spewing a jet of water.</p><p>Calling it a water arrow was an understatement; it was thicker than a water column.</p><p>The thick water arrow, as fast as lightning, pierced through half the battlefield, shooting directly towards the location Qin Sang had indicated.</p><p>Simultaneously, the armies received the order, and their top experts unleashed their attacks, cooperating closely.  The commander in that position, without hesitation, coordinated his subordinates, unleashing a barrage of demonic arts.</p><p>For a time,</p><p>The Zhen position roared like thunder.</p><p>The Dragon Whale's water arrow, the transformed bodies of great demons, the formidable煞of the demon soldiers, and various terrifying attacks converged.</p><p>Other demonic arts rained down on the enemy formation.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Although their attack wasn't aimed at the center of the primal yellow light, the illusory Sacred King Palace suddenly trembled. The light rings surrounding the demon soldiers of the Sacred King Palace in the Zhen position also vibrated.</p><p>Cries of alarm arose, followed by screams of agony.  The light rings around a significant portion of the demon soldiers shattered, exposing them directly to the terrifying attacks.  Heavy casualties resulted instantly.</p><p>Struck by this blow, the Sacred King Palace's forces immediately sensed something was wrong.</p><p>The Demon Kings hidden within the formation felt a sense of foreboding and contacted the central army, inquiring about what had happened.</p><p>Within the Sacred King Palace, the Demon Sages such as Bai Xiao Great Sage also wore grave expressions, mingled with bewilderment.</p><p>Although this array wasn't the original protective Immortal Array, it was still a powerful defensive array they had meticulously refined.  Even if it wasn't a match for the combined forces of the various races, it should have been able to hold them off for a while.</p><p>Once the spiritual treasures of the sacred grounds matured, they would plunder them and depart unhurriedly.</p><p>They never expected that a weakness would be exposed in the very first engagement.</p><p>Although there were issues with remote empowerment and the smooth operation of the array, their hearts began to pound with unease.</p><p>Could it be that another array master had emerged from one of the races?</p><p>"It must be a coincidence…"</p><p>Just as this thought flashed through Bai Xiao Great Sage's mind, he sensed the palace tremble again.  This time, it was the demon soldiers in the Qian position who suffered.</p><p>It wasn't a coincidence!</p><p>On the battlefield, the allied forces, following Qin Sang's commands, achieved repeated successes. The Dragon Whale Great Sage roared with delight, his cries echoing like a death knell to the Sacred King Palace's demon army.</p><p>Commands continued to arrive.</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was calm, his orders concise, never exceeding five words. Yet throughout, he remained at the periphery of the battlefield, never once personally intervening.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage assumed Qin Sang was fully focused on breaking the array and couldn't be distracted. He didn't mind this; these instructions were sufficient.</p><p>Qin Sang, without needing to lift a finger, could influence the course of the battle.</p><p>He stared at the illusory Sacred King Palace, his commands continuing.</p><p>"Qian…"</p><p>Just as he uttered a single word, Qin Sang was astonished to see the Dragon Whale Great Sage, abandoning his forward charge, suddenly retreat back into the whale pod.</p><p>The ninety-nine Dragon Whales seemed to have received some command. They surfaced one after another, their blood Qi surging wildly, roaring in unison, shaking the world.  Intense blood Qi surged along the chains towards the iron cage.</p><p>The iron cage was stained with blood, countless strange runes erupting from its iron bars, reflecting the blood-red sea below.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>One side of the iron cage suddenly opened, the side facing the Sacred Bone.</p><p>The next moment, a whale song emanated from within the cage.</p><p>The sound was deep and low, far less imposing than the Dragon Whale Great Sage's, yet every demon soldier on the battlefield could hear it clearly, feeling an inexplicable fear and unease.</p><p>Qin Sang was also startled.  He shifted his gaze and immediately noticed something unusual in the eye sockets of the Sacred Bone.  Then, he saw the skull open its massive mouth like a living creature.</p><p>*Crack… Crack…*</p><p>Within the Sacred Bone's mouth, a mass of water had accumulated at some point.</p><p>Limited by the size of the skull, this mass of water wasn't large, yet it seemed as profound as a vast ocean.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A torrent of water erupted, its momentum like a raging river, its form constantly shifting. Finally, it transformed into a colossal whale in mid-air!</p><p>This whale, entirely composed of water, was incredibly lifelike. Its appearance resembled other whales, yet its body was more slender than the Dragon Whale Great Sage's and several times larger.  Coupled with its full set of fangs, it appeared incredibly ferocious and awe-inspiring.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze narrowed.  He saw the giant whale thrash its tail fiercely, drawing a full moon arc in the void.  Immense water waves manifested out of thin air, seemingly drawn from within the giant whale's body.</p><p>Under countless horrified gazes, the giant tail, carrying the immense wave, slammed down with unparalleled force!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Giant waves soared skyward, swirling up countless bloody corpses and debris.</p><p>Visibly, the sea surface sank a whole layer where the giant tail struck.  Demon soldiers were crushed into meat paste, swept away by the raging waves as the Sacred King Palace's formation descended into chaos.</p><p>The might of a single strike from the Sacred Bone was truly terrifying!</p><p>"This Sacred Bone was obtained by my clan's ancestor, who guarded the edge of the East Sea's Return to Ruin alone for three hundred years.  He single-handedly hunted a Mad Whale that wandered to the edge of the Return to Ruin, dragged it back to the Central Continent, and refined it into a Sacred Bone using our clan's lifeblood…"</p><p>Qin Sang heard the sound transmission and saw the Dragon Whale Great Sage, at some point, had returned to the iron cage, struggling to close its door.</p><p>The Sacred Bone within the cage shook, as if about to awaken.</p><p>The ninety-nine Dragon Whales in the sea, their Qi depleted, sank beneath the surface to recuperate.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled upon hearing this.  Was the Dragon Whale Great Sage trying to display the strength of the Dragon Whale clan to him?</p><p>He had to admit, this Sacred Bone was formidable.</p><p>This was merely a portion of its power, activated by consuming blood Qi.  If it was truly as the Dragon Whale Great Sage claimed, that the Dragon Whales could ignite their blood essence to awaken the Mad Whale, it was indeed a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>With the Sacred Bone's intervention and its resounding victory, coupled with Qin Sang's guidance, the Sacred King Palace's defeat was a foregone conclusion.</p><p>At this moment, however, Qin Sang vanished without a trace.</p><p>The fighting continued.</p><p>The Sacred King Palace retreated again and again, completely different from before, their morale shattered. Bai Xiao Great Sage and the others were both shocked and furious, but even relying on the Sacred King Palace's grand array, they couldn't mount an effective counterattack.</p><p>At this time, the Dragon Whale Great Sage also manifested his human form, leading his forces in pursuit.</p><p>With the prestige of breaking the array earlier, the various races were utterly convinced.</p><p>Several figures had appeared beside him at some point, including a man wearing an imperial crown.  They were the commanders of the various armies.</p><p>The allied forces, united, pursued relentlessly, their momentum unstoppable.</p><p>The man with the imperial crown gently fanned himself, observing the battlefield with a furrowed brow. "The enemy's spirit is broken.  We should press our advantage and annihilate them.  Why has the Great Sage ordered a slowdown in the attack?  Aren't you afraid of missing this opportunity?"</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage claimed it was for the sake of caution, but inwardly, he sighed.</p><p>He hadn't given this order. It was the will of that Daoist.</p><p>He knew in his heart that he was merely a pawn in the Daoist's hands.  Of course, he didn't mind.</p><p>The Daoist orchestrated this demon race internal conflict, aiming directly at the Azure Fox Saint King.  Slowing the attack at this juncture was to allow the remnants of the Sacred King Palace to send out a plea for help, giving the Azure Fox Saint King time to come to their rescue.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the battlefield.</p><p>A man clad in armor flew swiftly and discreetly, his figure flickering in and out of visibility.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard someone say from behind,</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please wait."</p>
