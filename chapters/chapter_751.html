<h1>Chapter 743: The Storm and the Sanctuary</h1><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged at the heart of the Ten Directions Yama Array, took out the Winter Nether Cold Flame, enveloped it with the Nine Nether Demon Fire, and then carefully removed the restrictions on the cold flame's surface.</p><p>The cold flame remained unruly, yet it submitted to the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>The difference between these two spirit flames was obvious when they met head-on.  The claim that Kuiyin Ancestor used the Ten Directions Yama Array to dominate the Lesser Cold Region wasn't empty boasting.</p><p>Facing the Winter Nether Cold Flame, one felt utterly helpless.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had a plan, having rehearsed it countless times.  After a moment's thought, Qin Sang gently clenched his hand. The Nine Nether Demon Fire trembled and slowly compressed inwards.</p><p>The Winter Nether Cold Flame offered no resistance before retreating; the fireball visibly shrank.</p><p>But halfway through the process, Qin Sang suddenly stopped. He sensed instability in the Winter Nether Cold Flame; further forceful suppression might cause problems.</p><p>“As expected! Brute force won’t work; I need another approach.”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, allowing the Winter Nether Cold Flame to return to its original state. He then channeled a wisp of Nine Nether Demon Fire, his fingers dancing as he continuously cast several restrictions.  Wrapping this wisp of Nine Nether Demon Fire, he slowly drifted it towards the Winter Nether Cold Flame.</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>After a busy night, Qin Sang let out a long breath, his fatigue vanishing, replaced by excitement as he gazed at the blue pearl before him.</p><p>This was the fire pearl condensed from the Winter Nether Cold Flame. Qin Sang had experimented with several kinds of restrictions before finally refining it.</p><p>The fire pearl appeared to be the size of a dragon's eye, but its actual size was only that of a green bean, its surface radiating the cold flame's light.</p><p>After being refined into a pearl, the cold flame's aura seemed even more violent.</p><p>Its use requires caution; the fire pearl doesn't distinguish between friend and foe.</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely cautious. He carefully put away the fire pearl, feeling his chances of entering the Seven Killing Hall had increased significantly.</p><p>Then, a wave of weakness washed over him.  Refining the fire pearl had been extremely taxing. Qin Sang hurriedly put away the Ten Directions Yama Banner, activated his cultivation technique, and entered meditation to recover.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, this would take a whole month.</p><p>One day, while Qin Sang was meditating, he was suddenly awakened by an incredibly powerful aura.  He dashed out of his room and just happened to see Cui Ji also rushing out of his room.</p><p>The two men glared at each other with mutual dislike.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bother with Cui Ji's provocation. He looked up at the sky and saw a figure flying from the east, brazenly soaring over East Gate Island, then hanging motionless in plain sight.</p><p>Surprisingly, it was a Wu Clan cultivator!</p><p>“The Grand Shamaness has decreed, the great array is complete, the Seven Killing Hall will open tonight at midnight!”</p><p>Before the words had finished, the person’s light flickered and flew away in another direction. There were apparently two more islands similar to East Gate Island, not far away.</p><p>Cultivators who intended to enter the Seven Killing Hall were waiting on these three islands.</p><p>Upon hearing this, there was an uproar.</p><p>After waiting for so long, the Seven Killing Hall was finally about to open.</p><p>Several figures immediately soared into the sky from East Gate Island; those Nascent Soul masters could no longer contain themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his gaze, glancing around and seeing Xiang Yi striding towards him, saying, “The Seven Killing Hall is about to open. Let’s set off. Any of you who haven't finished their preparations, hurry up.”</p><p>The young man with the sword showed an excited smile. “I’ve been ready for this day!”</p><p>Others also nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Let's go!”</p><p>Xiang Yi led the way, and everyone followed.</p><p>At that moment, people came and went in the city, streams of light flying out from East Gate Island.</p><p>After leaving the island, they avoided the main crowd, detouring for a distance before flying towards the storm.</p><p>“Some have malicious intent, using the storm as cover to rob and murder.  Though we don’t need to worry too much given our strength, caution is still advised.”</p><p>Xiang Yi warned through voice transmission. Everyone summoned their treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang wore his Golden Light Armor, capable of handling most situations, so he only summoned his Ebony Sword and flew on it.</p><p>Cui Ji looked askance at Qin Sang, noticing he hadn't summoned the Ten Directions Yama Banner, and secretly sneered. He still thought the Nine Nether Demon Fire was responsible for the defilement of the Purple-幽 Pearl, unaware it was actually the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The storm grew closer.</p><p>As they approached the storm zone, Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.</p><p>Although one of the Liu couple was a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, they were unassuming and easy to approach.  Qin Sang was most familiar with them compared to the others.</p><p>The Liu surname man noticed Qin Sang’s unusual expression and curiously asked, “Daoist, have you discovered something?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, then added, "I've heard tales of the storms here, said to be as powerful as the forces of heaven and earth. Seeing it now, it truly is extraordinary.  I'm just worried that if we get lost in the storm, we don't know what will become of us."</p><p>Xiang Yi, hearing Qin Sang's words, turned his head and said, "Fellow Daoists, there's no need to worry. The jade pendants we received can sense the Seven Killing Hall's formation and will guide us within a certain range. Once you obtain the treasures and leave the Seven Killing Hall, follow the jade pendant's guidance, and you will safely exit. Of course, there is a risk of getting lost in the storm. Even the outer edges are extremely dangerous. If you truly get lost and wander into the storm's depths, even a Yuan Ying Master would perish, so don't lose your jade pendant..."</p><p>Qin Sang absentmindedly nodded.</p><p>He was in a state of shock.</p><p>Upon arriving and seeing the barriers protecting against the storm, Qin Sang's suspicions were confirmed.</p><p>These barriers were formed from ancient restrictions, with mysterious runes flashing within, firmly blocking the storm; they were strikingly similar to the barriers at the edge of the Xiao Han Domain's ancient immortal battlefield.</p><p>However, there were some differences.  There were no gaps like the Seven Heroes Pass, but it didn't impede cultivators from passing through.</p><p>Furthermore, the storm behind the barrier bore a resemblance to the celestial phenomena during the arrival of the spiritual tide on the ancient immortal battlefield.</p><p>The difference was that the ancient immortal battlefield was on land, while this was the vast ocean.</p><p>Moreover, the storm here raged incessantly with monstrous waves, never ceasing, unlike the Xiao Han Domain's spiritual tide, which only appeared periodically.</p><p>"Could it be that the edge of the Cang Lang Sea is also surrounded by an ancient immortal battlefield?"</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with curiosity about this world.</p><p>He didn't know what other places were like, but the two places he had visited—the Xiao Han Domain and the Cang Lang Sea—felt like two shelters in an apocalyptic world.</p><p>Those barriers were the legacies of ancient sages, shielding the dangers and creating a haven for later generations to recuperate and thrive.</p><p>It was said that the edge of the Demon Sea was similar to the Cang Lang Sea.</p><p>"What kind of world is this?!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, feeling a pressing need to grow stronger and explore the world's mysteries.</p><p>"Take out your jade pendants, activate your artifacts, and protect yourselves from the storm!"</p><p>Xiang Yi shouted, without producing any artifact, a green protective light surged from his body, likely from protective armor similar to Golden Glory Armor.</p><p>Xiang Yi shielded his jade pendant with both hands, infusing it with true energy, causing it to shine with a bright white light.  With a flash, Xiang Yi passed through the barrier and into the storm.</p><p>The others followed suit.</p><p>Qin Sang put aside his contemplations and astonishment, quickly following behind.</p>
