<h1>Chapter 1659: Adrift in the Star Sea</h1><p>The Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation actually had two Bi Mansions, one bright and one dark, the bright being a facade, the dark the true one. Kundao entered the true Bi Mansion.</p><p>This was the core of the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation.</p><p>If there was a formation master, they would be stationed in the Bi Mansion, and all the sword cultivators in the formation would obey their commands.</p><p>The Star Pavilion was placed here, as concealed as the cave dwelling within the Yang Flame Divine Restriction.</p><p>Kundao appeared before the Star Pavilion.</p><p>The Star Pavilion wasn't magnificent, only two stories high, its body slender like a sword. The upper floor had no walls, allowing a direct view inside.</p><p>At the four corners of the upper floor, a sword hung from each.</p><p>The sword blades were transparent, seemingly light swords formed from starlight, but their essence was similar to the sword stars, containing sword intent, pure and refined.</p><p>Four streams of sword intent descended, sealing the Star Pavilion.</p><p>Kundao stood still, her gaze passing over the Star Pavilion, surveying all the stars of the Bi Mansion.</p><p>At this moment, if Qin Sang and the others found a way to enter the Bi Mansion, they would surely be overjoyed.  For most of the stars of the Bi Mansion had shifted, their starlight flickering, and seeing these stars, they wouldn't need to painstakingly traverse the star sea any longer. With some thought, they could likely deduce a method to break the formation.</p><p>This phenomenon occurred because the Bi Mansion, as the formation's core, was the point of direct impact.</p><p>When Zhu Wudao destroyed the Jade Pavilion, the Bi Mansion bore the brunt, its internal energies clashing and colliding.  The aftermath spread to the Five Elements Divine Restrictions, then transmitted back, adding insult to injury.</p><p>With the core in chaos, the Seven Mansions trembled. If it couldn't be adjusted in time, the sword formation would gradually crumble, potentially even triggering the collapse of the Five Elements Divine Restrictions.</p><p>Starlight illuminated the upper half of Kundao's face, the lower half hidden in shadow, her expression unreadable.</p><p>Sharp sword intent surrounded the Star Pavilion, but Kundao ignored it.  Taking two steps forward, she raised her right hand, passed it through the sword intent, and effortlessly pushed open the Star Pavilion's door.</p><p>Similar to the cave dwelling in the Yang Flame Divine Restriction, the Star Pavilion's furnishings were simple.</p><p>Inside was a sword platform.</p><p>The sword intent from the suspended swords above penetrated the pavilion, forming four white pillars of light at the corners of the sword platform.</p><p>A female cultivator sat cross-legged on the platform.</p><p>Her attire was plain, without any adornments. On her lap lay a sword, engraved with seven stars, gleaming like inlaid gems under the light pillars.</p><p>Enveloped by sword intent, the female cultivator sat upright, her spine straight as a sword piercing the heavens!</p><p>However, the expression on her face was contorted with evident pain. Even after so long, one could still see the unwavering resolve in her eyes. She sat ramrod straight, as if resisting something.</p><p>Whether she had triumphed over her opponent was unknown, but the outcome was her demise here.</p><p>Only the female cultivator remained within the pavilion.</p><p>Kundao walked to the sword platform, reached out, and made a grasping motion. The female cultivator's features shifted, the pain disappearing, replaced by serenity.</p><p>Unlike the cave dwelling in the Yang Flame Divine Restriction, scorched by heavenly fire, the omnipresent sword intent had merged with the female cultivator's bones, becoming a kind of support, preserving her remains.</p><p>In fact, although the female cultivator's body seemed intact, her expression vivid, her life force was long extinguished.</p><p>Furthermore, Kundao could sense a unique sword intent emanating from the cultivator's remains, connected to the Star Pavilion's suspended swords. It was as if the female cultivator had refined herself into a sword.  She must have achieved extraordinary accomplishments in the Way of the Sword during her lifetime, and this was part of the reason.</p><p>Kundao didn't intend to disturb the cultivator's remains. She merely adjusted the cultivator's expression slightly, making it more pleasing to the eye, then reached directly into the sword platform, retrieving the cultivator's spatial storage treasure.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Treasures spilled onto the floor.</p><p>Habitually, Kundao picked out the edible items and consumed them. But unlike in the Yang Flame Divine Restriction's cave dwelling, she picked up the other items one by one, examining them, her eyes thoughtful, assessing their value in a cultivator's eyes.</p><p>Before long, Kundao left the Star Pavilion, leaping to the edge of the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, where it bordered the Earth Divine Restriction.</p><p>The sword formation was dim, sword stars hanging in the void.</p><p>The Earth Divine Restriction appeared even darker than the sword formation, filled with heavy mist that flowed through the space.  The swirling mist resembled burning flames, alternating between grey-black and dark yellow, lacking any lightness, and giving a weighty impression.</p><p>The sword formation and the dark mist, two distinct forces, converged here without conflict. Under the governance of the Five Elements Restrictions, their energies flowed smoothly according to the five elements' cycle of generation.</p><p>The abnormality within the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation affected the other Divine Restrictions, but it would take time, and the effects weren't yet apparent.</p><p>Kundao glanced around, then reached out, grasping a wisp of mist. The familiar feeling returned. Without the constraints of sword intent, she could control the Earth Divine Restriction to a certain extent.</p><p>She was about to step into the dark mist, to plunder the treasures within the Earth Divine Restriction and increase her bargaining chips, when she suddenly sensed something, her brows furrowing.</p><p>Events always spiraled out of control.</p><p>Her objectives were progressing faster than anticipated, and Kundao felt the pressure of time.</p><p>Within the sword formation.</p><p>The Venom King's and Su Zinan's groups had joined forces.  Bearing little animosity towards each other, they exchanged information and combined their observations of the shifted stars.</p><p>This greatly accelerated their progress.</p><p>Moreover, with four Grand Cultivators working together, their speed in breaking the formation was incomparable to Qin Sang's, significantly faster.</p><p>At this point, Kundao could only swiftly return to the Star Pavilion and make preparations.</p><p>She already had a plan for what came next.</p><p>Standing atop the Star Pavilion, Kundao scanned her surroundings, locking onto a point in the distant void. This was a hidden star, also the core of the entire formation.</p><p>She could move freely within the sword formation, her perception of its energies reaching a profound level, grasping its essence. Anyone who could achieve this, even without swordsmanship, could locate the formation's core and manipulate it.</p><p>This was precisely Kundao's ability.</p><p>Her figure flickered, merging with the hidden star.</p><p>Instantly, the hidden star flared brightly, then vanished again.</p><p>Immediately after, a peculiar fluctuation emanated from the hidden star, affecting the surrounding stars, their light flickering. When it reached the Star Pavilion, this effect magnified dramatically.</p><p>The area around the Star Pavilion blazed with starlight, including the three adjacent sword stars.</p><p>Four stars shone together, quickly becoming as bright as the moon.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang and the Venom King's group, located in other lunar mansions, sensed the change and looked towards the horizon. A faint starlight glimmered at the edge of the star sea.</p><p>Compared to the myriad star trails, this starlight was insignificant, yet it was what they had been desperately searching for.</p><p>"Bi Mansion!"</p><p>Everyone calculated and compared it to their star charts, their hearts filled with joy.</p><p>During their time trapped within the sword formation, they had deduced that the visible Bi Mansion was a fake. The true Bi Mansion was hidden, and it was the core of the formation!</p><p>To break the formation, they needed to find the core, the point of greatest energy fluctuation, the source of the stellar shifts.</p><p>By controlling the core, they could find a way out!</p><p>As the sword formation operated, the lunar mansions constantly shifted. They could only locate the Bi Mansion by tracking the displaced stars and deciphering the formation’s arrangement.</p><p>The Bi Mansion remained hidden deep within the formation.</p><p>Now, with the sudden appearance of bright stars in the Bi Mansion, it was like a guiding light.</p><p>Had these bright stars appeared earlier, they wouldn't have needed to go through so much trouble, simply following the light to its source.</p><p>They weren't surprised by the appearance of the bright stars.</p><p>It was unexpected, yet reasonable.</p><p>They had theorized that as the sword formation edged closer to collapse, the Bi Mansion's appearance was inevitable, signifying that the internal energy conflicts had intensified to a critical point.</p><p>With enough patience, even if they remained stationary, the sword formation would eventually break down on its own if it couldn't be adjusted in time, but they couldn't afford to wait that long.</p><p>However, with the Bi Mansion's revelation, all their previous painstaking calculations were rendered useless, which was frustrating.</p><p>In the vast starry expanse, the bright stars appeared faint.</p><p>As soon as they appeared, they were engulfed by dazzling star trails, disappearing into the star river, invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>Having glimpsed the bright stars, they wouldn't let them escape their sight.  Including Qin Sang, each displayed their divine abilities, locking onto the bright stars and flying into the star river.</p><p>Their minds freed from complex calculations, they finally noticed the magnificent beauty of the starry sky!</p><p>Even with their high cultivation, they could only look up in awe, the sun, moon, and stars seemingly unattainable.</p><p>Now, the bright stars drifted within the star river.</p><p>They chased the stars, soaring through the star river, traversing the void, the stars within reach, an unprecedented experience.</p><p>Even though the stars were illusory.</p><p>Su Zinan's group also ceased their discussions, fully immersed in the scenery.</p><p>Of course, they hadn't forgotten their primary objective.</p><p>Qin Sang firmly locked onto the bright stars, constantly flying, realizing that the stars were also moving rapidly, their movements seemingly random and unpredictable.  He could only increase his speed, as did Su Zinan and the others.</p><p>They understood that this was normal. If the Bi Mansion were so easily accessible, the sword formation would be a joke.</p><p>Qin Sang even suspected that this wasn't the full extent of the formation's changes.</p><p>If the sword stars weren't composed of static sword intent, but individual sword cultivators, not only would the formation's power be amplified, but the core might also be able to shift constantly between the seven western lunar mansions.</p><p>At its peak, the formation's transformations would be truly boundless.</p><p>As his thoughts raced, Qin Sang drew closer to the bright stars. He hadn't forgotten the mysterious enemy lurking in the shadows, but the Fire Jade Centipede was drowsy, and the person seemed to have truly given up.</p><p>Within the sword formation, Qin Sang had no idea how far he'd traveled.</p><p>Finally, the bright stars drew nearer.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang felt a strange sensation.</p><p>The surrounding stars remained, their number unchanged, but he knew he had entered a new realm, the true Bi Mansion, the formation's core!</p><p>"Finally inside…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression relaxed, his gaze still fixed on the bright stars.</p><p>Upon entering the Bi Mansion, the scene transformed. The previously faint bright stars now shone brilliantly.</p><p>Gazing for a moment, Qin Sang realized there were four stars, shining together, no wonder they were so conspicuous.  That area must be the point of greatest energy conflict.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate, swiftly approaching the bright stars.</p><p>But before he could reach them, an unexpected sight unfolded.</p><p>Behind the bright stars, a vast expanse of thick mist surged forth, like a nebula in the starry sky.</p><p>But the nebula was too vast, stretching across the background of the stars, its boundaries distinct, extending to both sides, seemingly endless.</p><p>"Where did this nebula come from? No!"</p><p>Qin Sang's confusion was quickly replaced by understanding.</p><p>It wasn't a nebula, but the edge of the sword formation. However, beyond it wasn't the exit, but another of the Five Elements Divine Restrictions. Earth generated Metal, Metal generated Water, judging by its aura, dense rather than ethereal, it was most likely the Earth Divine Restriction.</p><p>The energies of the Five Elements Divine Restrictions interconnected, forming a unified whole.</p><p>Within the sword formation, the stars flowed ceaselessly, the positions of the Seven Mansions constantly shifting. It was entirely possible for the Bi Mansion to move, carrying them to the edge of the Earth Divine Restriction.</p><p>Having spent so long within the depleting sword formation, Qin Sang certainly wouldn't enter the Earth Divine Restriction, or he'd have to start all over again.</p><p>He averted his gaze, his focus remaining on the bright stars.</p><p>However, what he saw next astonished him.</p><p>The Earth Divine Restriction connected to the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, with sword stars constantly drifting past its edge. This was a common occurrence when the Five Elements Divine Restrictions functioned normally.</p><p>Therefore, even if the sword stars were incredibly close to the Earth Divine Restriction, they wouldn't collide with it, nor trigger a violent reaction.  For countless years, they had flowed ceaselessly without incident.</p><p>But because Zhu Wudao had shattered the Jade Pavilion, causing energy conflicts within the sword formation, this harmony had been disrupted.</p><p>The sword stars of the other lunar mansions hadn't shifted significantly and hadn't collided with the Earth Divine Restriction.</p><p>But now it was different. The true Bi Mansion, the core of the sword formation, had drifted over. The Bi Mansion was the origin of the chaos within the formation, and its sword stars had shifted considerably, especially these four that had become bright stars, almost deviating entirely from their original trajectories.</p><p>Passing so close to the Earth Divine Restriction like this, how could there not be an incident?</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Restrictions were immense. While such an incident wouldn't directly cause a Divine Restriction to collapse, the cumulative effect couldn't be ignored, and it was fatal to the sword stars themselves!</p><p>Qin Sang turned his gaze back, witnessing the four bright stars tracing an arc-shaped trail in the void, drifting towards the Earth Divine Restriction.  As they neared the 'nebula,' the arc began to curve back.</p><p>However, precisely because of their deviation, they didn't follow their designated path completely. To Qin Sang's astonishment, they collided with the 'nebula'!</p><p>At the same moment, in another part of the Bi Mansion, Su Zinan and the others, closer than Qin Sang, also watched this scene with surprise.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The halo formed by the four bright stars struck the 'nebula' first.</p><p>Instantly, the impact tore a large hole in the 'nebula,' but the void within churned with dense mist, an endless tide of mist surging back.</p><p>The four stars moved together, the closest one making contact with the 'nebula' first, half of it submerged.</p><p>With luck, if the deviation wasn't too severe, this bright star might have a chance to return.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a surprising event unfolded.</p><p>The bright star, upon contacting the nebula, trembled violently, then completely deviated from its path, plunging straight into the depths of the nebula.  The change was so swift that Qin Sang and the others were caught off guard.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>"Nine Nether Geomagnetic Force!"</p><p>The Venom King gravely revealed the nature of the 'nebula.'</p><p>The grey-black and dark yellow swirling mist was formed from Nine Nether Geomagnetic Force. The  Formless Immortal Sect had actually channeled the Nine Nether Geomagnetic Force from the depths of the earth, forming the Earth Divine Restriction here!</p><p>The bright star, colliding with the geomagnetic force, was pulled directly into the 'nebula.' This was just the beginning of the chain reaction. The agitated geomagnetic force pulled the other three bright stars inward as well.</p><p>At this moment, the first bright star, unable to withstand the geomagnetic force's pull, suddenly exploded. The shockwave swept outwards, instantly detonating the closest star. The remaining two were scattered by the blast, narrowly escaping destruction.</p><p>In this instant.</p><p>Qin Sang strained his eyes, finally seeing clearly that the second bright star wasn't a normal sword star, but a sword-shaped Star Pavilion.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Star Pavilion exploded!</p>
