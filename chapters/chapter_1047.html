<h1>Chapter 1339: A Grab for the Spoils (Extra chapter for the alliance leader Wen Qi Bu Kai Qiang!)</h1><p>Chapter 1339: A Grab for the Spoils (Extra chapter for the alliance leader Wen Qi Bu Kai Qiang!)</p><p>She thought she and Yue Xiangu were in cahoots, so she didn't dare ask me for help.</p><p>No wonder I found Su Nu and Yue Xiangu's relationship strange.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the scene when he left the Demon Island and encountered cultivators from the Xi You Alliance.</p><p>Seeing Su Nu's ability to control True Demon Qi, the Xi You Alliance immediately tried to seize her.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, knowing my origins, you should understand why I’m wary of the Dong Ji Alliance. I'm like an item specifically refined.  Also, the cultivation method I practice isn't normal; it’s slowly changing me, terrifying me, making me anxious day and night!  This unease has intensified in the Seven Killing Hall, even making me tremble.”</p><p>Su Nu finally found someone to confide in, revealing her emotions without reservation.</p><p>Through Su Nu's words, Qin Sang connected many scattered pieces.</p><p>“Five Yin Exquisite Body, True Demon Qi, True Demon Technique, Ancient Demon, Xi You Alliance, Dong Ji Alliance... what secrets are hidden within?”</p><p>Qin Sang had a premonition that he had touched upon some shocking secret.</p><p>“If I were in your shoes, I would also be wary of the Dong Ji Alliance.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, but he didn't fully believe her.</p><p>The cultivation world is full of old monsters who have lived for decades or even centuries, many with superb acting skills.</p><p>However, Qin Sang hadn't figured out why Su Nu would weave such a long story to deceive him.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, do you think Elder Ye's illegal entry here is related to you, and that he’s trying to save himself? Would he sacrifice the Soul Cleansing Liquid to make me do something for you?  I'm afraid I'd be hard-pressed to do anything against Elder Ye.”</p><p>Qin Sang pressed further.</p><p>If it were simply rescuing someone from a Yuan Ying ancestor, he wouldn't hesitate.</p><p>“I constantly yearn for self-preservation, to escape the Dong Ji Alliance, and I’ll do anything for it!”</p><p>Su Nu's tone was resolute, then deflated, saying miserably, “They’ve implanted a mark on me, afraid I’ll escape, aren't they? Without Elder Ye, I might have a chance to save myself. Now, I can only rely on outside help. If you agree, take this Ghost Seal. After leaving the Bewitching Cave, don't rush to leave the trial ground. Follow me, guided by the Ghost Seal. If I'm in danger, activate the Ghost Seal's power from afar. Don't worry; it won't implicate you. If nothing happens, leave as you please. If I survive, I will gladly offer you the Soul Cleansing Liquid!”</p><p>“So simple?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, seeing a small ghost-headed seal between Tu Ling’s fingers.</p><p>The seal was small, the ghost head like a sealed evil spirit; its function wasn't apparent from its appearance.</p><p>“I don’t know how effective it will be; it’s a Hail Mary,” Su Nu said with a wry smile.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, silent.</p><p>Actually, he believed Su Nu’s words about seven or eight tenths.</p><p>With so many people vying for the Soul Cleansing Liquid, Su Nu wouldn't have needed to invent such a story to deceive him.</p><p>Whether the masked man is Elder Ye, and whether Su Nu is lying, will be verified soon.</p><p>But he didn't immediately agree to Su Nu.</p><p>He had other plans.</p><p>The premise of trading with Su Nu and obtaining the Soul Cleansing Liquid was that he could rescue her.</p><p>This roundabout approach is too prone to variables, and he needs to find the ancient teleportation array after leaving the trial ground; he doesn't have time to get entangled with Su Nu.</p><p>Compared to that, he wants a foolproof plan!</p><p>“I can make a deal with you, but the terms can be changed.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered. “Of course, this is on the condition that you're telling the truth and not deceiving me!”</p><p>“Deceiving you wouldn't benefit me in the slightest, especially since you saved my life,” Su Nu almost swore, her voice urgent. “My secondary soul is about to dissipate.  Fellow Daoist, tell me your conditions, don't play riddles. As long as I can…”</p><p>“I want you to help me compete for the Soul Cleansing Liquid here! Whether I succeed or fail, I will help you.”</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>“What? You want to compete with Elder Ye for the Soul Cleansing Liquid?”</p><p>Su Nu exclaimed.</p><p>“Yes, if what you say is true, Elder Ye can only temporarily unseal his cultivation and is injured, so there's no need to be overly afraid. I have a method that can threaten a Yuan Ying cultivator; success isn't impossible.”</p><p>Opportunities are seized.</p><p>Qin Sang relied on his Summoning Thunder Technique, Demon Banner, and superb escape techniques; he might be able to be the unexpected winner.</p><p>“Elder Ye certainly wouldn't expect someone to even abandon the Soul Cleansing Liquid.  What she said should be true. But threatening a Yuan Ying doesn't mean Elder Ye is truly afraid of you! I know Elder Ye best; Yuan Ying cultivators are unfathomable. Who can say for sure if he doesn't have other means?”</p><p>Su Nu refused without hesitation. “Even with his cultivation sealed, Elder Ye remains a Yuan Ying ancestor; he surpasses us in other aspects. Fellow Daoist, don't overestimate yourself; I won’t risk it with you.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly.  "Naturally, I'll ensure everything is foolproof before acting.  And your identity will remain hidden. Aren't you supposed to be manipulating the formation and supporting Elder Ye? All you need to do is delay them for a short while."</p><p>"So..."</p><p>Su Nu hesitated. "I can try."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, grasped the ghost seal, and made a vow. "Rest assured, friend. I value my life even more than you do, and won't act rashly. Even if we fail to obtain the Soul Cleansing Liquid, our agreement remains."</p><p>"I hope you will keep your promise."</p><p>Tu Ling's eyes glazed over, then lost all luster, collapsing to the ground and beginning to dissolve.</p><p>Their exchange, though seemingly complex, took very little time.</p><p>Ming Wei hesitated, unsure who Qin Sang was interacting with or what was discussed.  She now relied heavily on Qin Sang and didn't dare speak rashly.</p><p>Qin Sang held the ghost seal, feeling a chill in his palm.</p><p>He stared intently at the Soul Cleansing Liquid and the seal, took a deep breath, and quickly sorted through the clues in his mind.</p><p>Whether Su Nu's words were true or false, he couldn't afford to be careless.</p><p>Sensing Ming Wei's gaze, Qin Sang sent a voice transmission. "I have good news and bad news."</p><p>Ming Wei froze, then listened.</p><p>"The good news is, someone will help us eliminate our opponents. The bad news is, that person clearing the path might be a Yuan Ying master!"</p><p>Ming Wei's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>"Don't ask where the information came from or whether it's true. Regardless, we must prepare early and cooperate fully if we want to obtain the Soul Cleansing Liquid," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Fight a Yuan Ying for treasure?"</p><p>Ming Wei looked at him like he was insane, almost turning to leave.</p><p>"I'm not crazy enough to confront a Yuan Ying master directly. But remember, this is a trial realm; there are restrictions on Yuan Ying masters…" Qin Sang paused, "If you're willing to stay, follow my earlier proposal, and you won't be taking too much risk."</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>The burden of debt is heavy.</p><p>I got back on the bus today, and realized that I was procrastinating more and more, so I decided to pull an all-nighter. I wrote four chapters, and finally caught up on the overdue updates!</p><p>Hoping to slack off at work +_+</p>
