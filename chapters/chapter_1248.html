<h1>Chapter 1240: The Dao Lineage</h1><p>Chapter 1240: The Dao Lineage</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>Gong Liangyu knew his status was unique, unlike other Golden Core cultivators, making him an easy target.  He’d deliberately arrived half an hour late to avoid attention.</p><p>Yet, he was still being followed.</p><p>The pursuer no longer concealed their aura; it was a Nascent Soul master. Only a Nascent Soul cultivator could have followed him undetected for so long.</p><p>Gong Liangyu was startled.  Forgetting about the Blood Ginseng, he hastily summoned his Nascent Soul puppet for protection.</p><p>The Blood Ginseng was an illusion, the Nascent Soul was following him…</p><p>These strange occurrences sent chills down Gong Liangyu’s spine. He realized he might have fallen into a trap without even knowing it.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator now charged openly.</p><p>A brilliant light, like a celebratory cloud, hovered above Dongyang Bo.</p><p>The Vajra Wheel shot out concentric ripples, repelling the blood shadows.</p><p>“Dongyang Bo!”</p><p>Gong Liangyu’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>His mind raced through possible Nascent Soul cultivators:  cultivators from the Xiaohan Domain’s demonic path, members of the Tianxing Alliance, even spies from the Abyss of Sin.  Dongyang Bo was the last person he suspected.</p><p>During Grandmaster Tieguanzi’s reign over the Shangyuan Quiet Palace, an alliance had been formed with Mount Shaohua, together constituting the Eight Sects of the Righteous Path.</p><p>There were inevitable frictions between the disciples of both factions, but it didn’t affect the overall situation.</p><p>After Tieguanzi’s demise at the Ziwei Palace, Gong Liangyu took over. While wary of Dongyang Bo, he didn't want to disrupt their relationship.</p><p>One shouldn't provoke a tiger, but this tiger harbored malicious intent.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was actually attacking him!</p><p>Gong Liangyu wasn't naive enough to believe Dongyang Bo's presence was a coincidence!</p><p>But he had too many unanswered questions.</p><p>Dongyang Bo now unleashed the full power of the Vajra Wheel, charging towards him.</p><p>He plowed through the blood shadows.  The Vajra Wheel emitted countless afterimages, repelling the blood shadows, preventing them from getting close.  His maneuverability far surpassed that of the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>Dongyang Bo showed no pretense. Ignoring Gong Liangyu’s confused and furious gaze, he stared intently at the Nascent Soul puppet Gong Liangyu had summoned for protection, exclaiming, “No wonder the Shangyuan Quiet Palace has flourished and its lineage has endured! This renowned Nascent Soul puppet truly lives up to its reputation. With such a puppet, the Dao lineage is guaranteed to thrive. When I reach the afterlife, I can finally give an account of myself to Master!”</p><p>Hearing this, Gong Liangyu suddenly understood.  His doubts were finally resolved. The old scoundrel’s target wasn't anything else, but the Shangyuan Quiet Palace’s treasured Nascent Soul puppet!</p><p>This sent another wave of shock through Gong Liangyu.</p><p>His first thought upon seeing Dongyang Bo was that the old man had somehow learned about the Blood Ginseng and was there to compete with him for it.</p><p>While Dongyang Bo himself wouldn’t have used the Blood Ginseng, he had countless disciples, none of whom had reached the Nascent Soul stage, so his desire for the herb was understandable.</p><p>As for the Nascent Soul puppet grasping the illusory Blood Ginseng, it was likely an inherent self-preservation mechanism of the mature herb; the real plant was probably nearby.</p><p>Heaven cherishes life; countless rare flowers and herbs possess similar abilities.</p><p>The world knows little about the Blood Ginseng; its lack of documentation wasn't unusual.</p><p>So, while startled, Gong Liangyu believed that with the Nascent Soul puppet and his sect's life-saving techniques, even if he couldn't outmatch Dongyang Bo, he could still escape.</p><p>He could always retreat and close the mountain, finding another path to breakthrough.</p><p>The world turns; there will always be a chance for revenge.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, using his superior strength to bully the weak and steal a treasure, wouldn’t dare to attack the Shangyuan Quiet Palace, would he?</p><p>What Gong Liangyu didn’t expect was that Dongyang Bo’s target wasn't the Blood Ginseng, but the Nascent Soul puppet.  It seemed he had anticipated Gong Liangyu bringing it out!</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet wasn't a secret among people like Dongyang Bo.  There were even rumors, possibly deliberately spread by the Shangyuan Quiet Palace, that the Nascent Soul puppet couldn't leave the mountain gate, thus deterring others.</p><p>This meant that every step Gong Liangyu had taken since deciding to come to Blood Lake had been orchestrated by Dongyang Bo!</p><p>The news about the Blood Ginseng…</p><p>The true danger of the Nascent Soul puppet…</p><p>And, Dongyang Bo knew about the Spirit-Fixing Jade on his person – the jade that could resist the puppet’s bite and allow him to control the puppet to find treasures –  allowing him to set this trap.</p><p>Gong Liangyu felt a bone-chilling cold, as if plunged into an ice cave!</p><p>His mind buzzed, a chaotic mess.  He began to question everything.  Since taking over the Shangyuan Quiet Palace, how many times had Dongyang Bo secretly manipulated him?</p><p>Even earlier than that!</p><p>Senior Brother Tie Guanzi, once possessing the potential for Yuan Ying (Nascent Soul) cultivation, was forced to use a Yuan Ying puppet due to a sudden calamity at the sect, cutting short his path. Was Dongyang Bo behind it?  Was his death at Ziwei Palace truly natural?</p><p>I, having only recently formed my Golden Core, experienced an accident that left me with a difficult-to-treat ailment, causing repeated failures in my attempts to achieve Yuan Ying. Only recently did I find the medicinal herbs to cure my injury.</p><p>Was that attack truly accidental?</p><p>At this moment, Gong Liangyu felt overwhelming fear towards Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Dongyang Bo turned his gaze to Gong Liangyu and said calmly, "My disciples are dull-witted, none capable of great responsibility. I had no choice but to resort to this, and I apologize for the inconvenience, friend."</p><p>Gong Liangyu gritted his teeth, still wanting to confirm some things, "That jade scroll, and the Spirit Stabilizing Jade…"</p><p>"Indeed, it was I!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo nodded slightly. "The jade scroll is genuine, but the senior who discovered it found the Blood Boiling Evil Flower; I have already taken it. I merely changed its name. As for the Spirit Stabilizing Jade, I intended to leave it for my incompetent disciples to use during their Heart Demon Tribulation, but unfortunately, none of them showed promise. Thus, I manufactured a fortunate encounter for you…"</p><p>Speaking of his successful scheme, Dongyang Bo's face showed little joy, as it truly was a matter of last resort.</p><p>His calculations were profound; he had long been scheming against the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace, thoroughly investigating the Yuan Ying puppet, and painstakingly searching for the Spirit Stabilizing Jade.</p><p>However, he didn't want to forcibly seize the Yuan Ying puppet unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Firstly, he was aware of the dangers of the Yuan Ying puppet. Not only was the cost of manipulation extremely high, but with the accumulation of more and more spirit shadows, it would eventually lose control and devour its master. If no one could subdue it, it would bring great disaster to the sect.</p><p>Secondly, he had cultivated his power for many years, and Shangyuan Qingjing Palace had become increasingly reliant on Shao Hua Mountain, which could still be a valuable ally in the future.</p><p>The premise was that Shao Hua Mountain could produce another Yuan Ying cultivator to carry on the lineage.</p><p>Otherwise, decline was imminent, so what future could there be?</p><p>To Dongyang Bo's shame, despite his years of diligent work, none of his disciples had achieved Yuan Ying. He could still help his disciples form their Golden Cores, but achieving Yuan Ying was the greatest hurdle for cultivators, and even he could not help with this, leaving him only to sigh silently.</p><p>The jade scroll Gong Liangyu mentioned was a relic left by a senior who had once entered Blood Lake, recording the senior's observations there.</p><p>Blood Lake had been sealed for many years and recently reopened, so Gong Liangyu would not be overly wary. Moreover, these records were genuine and impossible for an outsider to forge.</p><p>After obtaining it, Dongyang Bo changed the name of the medicinal herb and used various methods to give it to Gong Liangyu.</p><p>Nine truths and one falsehood – it truly deceived Gong Liangyu.</p>
