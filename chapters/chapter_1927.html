<h1>Chapter 1918: The Thunder霄 Assembly</h1><p>Arriving in Tanzhou city, Qin Sang paid the boat fare with eight taels of silver. After reporting his identity to the gatekeeper, he successfully met the city god of Tanzhou.</p><p>The city god’s attitude was warm but cautious.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t stay long.  He claimed he was interested in exploring the world's thunder techniques and asked the city god to keep an eye out for nearby cultivators and factions known for their mastery of thunder techniques, before taking his leave.</p><p>Back on the Fuchun River, Qin Sang boarded a passenger ship.</p><p>The Fuchun River ends within Ji State, eventually flowing into another large river. This ship could travel directly to Ji State, passing through two countries and stopping at major cities in each prefecture to resupply.  Normally, it sailed day and night, a true ocean-going vessel.</p><p>The ship could carry thousands of people, and even at its least busy, there were still hundreds of passengers on board.</p><p>Passengers came from all over, making the ship a more diverse place than any city.  People ate, slept, and relieved themselves on the ship; there were two dining areas, one upstairs, elegant and expensive, the other downstairs. Qin Sang preferred the lower deck, often spending the whole day there with Xiao Wu, setting up a "healing the world" stall and actually treating people.</p><p>The ship owner, seeing that he was offering free medical care, waived his fees and even gave him a separate table in a corner, partly out of curiosity.</p><p>After all, Qin Sang's request was rather unusual: no payment was accepted, only the telling of a deeply personal story in exchange for treatment.</p><p>Initially, he was seen as a charlatan, with patients telling whimsical tales; Qin Sang didn't mind.</p><p>However, it turned out the Daoist had genuine skill.  He could often pinpoint the cause of illness in a few words, leading some to hail him as a divine healer.</p><p>The reputation of the "divine healer" spread throughout the ship. Even upper-deck passengers, regardless of their status, crowded the lower deck.  Not only could they receive treatment, but they could also hear stories.  The hall was packed, disrupting the ship's normal operations.</p><p>The ship owner had to restrict the flow of people and wanted to set up a separate consulting room for Qin Sang, but Qin Sang refused.</p><p>New passengers were given friendly reminders by the crew, leading them to visit Qin Sang, who never lacked for patients.</p><p>Some resourceful crew members even tried to spread the word when the ship docked, hoping to profit from Qin Sang's fame; the wealthy and powerful in the city would pay handsomely.</p><p>But Qin Sang would disembark and disappear as soon as the ship docked, reappearing just as mysteriously when it set sail.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang and Xiao Wu encountered many prefectural and city gods.  However, as the Fuchun River didn't pass through the capital, Qin Sang didn't make a special visit.</p><p>Along their journey, Qin Sang and Xiao Wu heard many stories, some true, some false; some heartbreaking, some heartwarming, and others infuriating and tragic.</p><p>Xiao Wu always stayed by Qin Sang's side during consultations, acting as his apprentice.</p><p>One evening,</p><p>The ship had already left Liu State and was nearing Ji State.</p><p>Qin Sang's fame had grown, making him a household name on the ship.</p><p>Even before dinnertime, the crew crowded into the hall to watch.</p><p>A plainly dressed woman was tearfully recounting her life's hardships: a bad marriage in her youth, subsequent bullying by her in-laws, neighbors, and siblings, and finally, a bad choice in a daughter-in-law. She spoke incessantly, letting out the occasional wail.</p><p>Finally finding an audience, the woman rambled on for over half an hour, showing no sign of stopping.</p><p>The other listeners were growing impatient.  Some tried to shoo her away, but Qin Sang was listening intently.</p><p>Such was the power of a great reputation: everyone on board, from the ship owner to the passengers, treated Qin Sang with the utmost respect.</p><p>Xiao Wu also watched the woman intently, never having seen someone so talkative.</p><p>Even the gods could no longer bear it.</p><p>An empty chair sat next to Qin Sang's desk, but those around seemed to ignore it, keeping a respectful distance.</p><p>Unseen by anyone, a man in elegant white robes languidly sat in the chair.</p><p>The man stood up, brushed his clothes, and sighed.</p><p>"Daoist, if you wish to get rid of me, simply say so. There's no need for such suffering, leading to a mutual defeat."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. "This woman has been suffering from repressed anger for years, a chronic illness. Allowing her to vent it will alleviate her symptoms by seventy percent. I'm treating her, Jiang God. How can you call it suffering? Besides, Xiao Wu is enjoying it."</p><p>Xiao Wu leaned closer to Qin Sang, showing she was indeed listening attentively.</p><p>The man was the river spirit of the Fuchun River. He sensed a stranger on board and came to visit.</p><p>The refined gentleman shook his head repeatedly.  "Master Daoist enjoys these old tales. Why not visit my River Spirit Temple? I guarantee you'll be entertained! I don't have your enthusiasm, so I'll take my leave."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed in farewell. "River Spirit, rest assured. My visit is purely out of curiosity, and I won't interfere with life and death matters."</p><p>"As long as you aren't using your cultivation to harm people, whatever you do is none of my business.  Meeting you is good fortune for these people..."</p><p>The refined gentleman walked outside, the crowd unconsciously parting to make way.</p><p>"Right," the refined gentleman remembered something, and asked Qin Sang to produce his travel permit for the River Spirit's seal.</p><p>"Great events are brewing in Ji State. The gods and spirits, and even the plants and trees, are on high alert. With my seal, you should be able to pass without hindrance…"</p><p>Before Qin Sang could inquire about these events, the refined gentleman had already disappeared outside.</p><p>…</p><p>The grand ship cut through the waves, its speed astonishing. It finally reached Ji State.</p><p>On the great river, border controls were set up on both the sunny and shady sides of the river.</p><p>Several border guards boarded the ship, found Qin Sang, and upon seeing the River Spirit’s seal on his permit, bowed respectfully.</p><p>"We are merely following orders. Please forgive any shortcomings in our service."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the river and asked, "What has happened in Ji State? Is everywhere as heavily guarded as here?"</p><p>The border guards exchanged glances. Their leader asked, "Are you here for the Lei Xiao Assembly?"</p><p>"The Lei Xiao Assembly?"</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind stirred. It sounded connected to the Lei Xiao Sect.  His purpose was to investigate the Lei Department's legacy.  He bowed and said, "I humbly request your explanation."</p><p>The border guards explained the situation.</p><p>"After the Lei Xiao Sect fractured, its legacies were scattered. Those who obtained parts of the legacy all claim to be the rightful successors, arguing for years without resolution.</p><p>"Three factions are the strongest: the Barbarian Thunder Sect, the Five Lights Gate, and the Gold Wash Mountain.  The Five Lights Gate is a prominent sect within Ji State.</p><p>"If it were merely a succession dispute, that would be one thing. But a treasure trove was discovered at the old site of the Lei Xiao Sect, possibly containing their old treasures, causing a huge uproar.</p><p>"The factions with connections to the Lei Xiao Sect have united, refusing outsiders while fiercely battling amongst themselves, nearly causing a major disturbance.</p><p>"Then, somehow, they agreed on a Lei Xiao Assembly.</p><p>"Two months from now, the Five Lights Gate will host the Assembly at the old Lei Xiao Sect site.  Sects, families, and independent cultivators from Ji State and nearby areas with ties to the Lei Xiao Sect will attend.</p><p>"All sorts of people will be there, including those ruthless and unpredictable. We must be vigilant!"</p><p>Qin Sang understood.  When the young man left Ji State, he had heard rumors of someone finding treasure at the old Lei Xiao Sect site.</p><p>The turmoil hadn't subsided; now they were holding an Assembly.  It seemed they’d made another significant discovery.</p><p>Perfect timing. Qin Sang had planned to visit the Five Lights Gate first, but now he'd go directly to the old Lei Xiao Sect site.</p><p>After dismissing the border guards, Qin Sang disembarked with his horse.</p><p>The ship's owner, a stout merchant, stood on the deck, watching his manager negotiate with the border guards.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang descend, the merchant greeted him with a smile. "Master Daoist, going for another riverside stroll? The borderlands are a dangerous place. We'll only stay overnight and leave tomorrow morning. Please don’t miss the departure."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed. "Thank you for your hospitality these past days. I must leave the ship."</p><p>His meals and drinks onboard were complimentary, and the manager even returned his fare.</p><p>"Leaving?"</p><p>The merchant was startled. "Master Daoist, you're going?"</p><p>"All good things must come to an end.  Until we meet again," Qin Sang led his horse toward the shore.</p><p>'Clip! Clip! Clip!'</p><p>The merchant hurried after him, urgently saying, "Master Daoist, traveling with the young girl is inconvenient.  Why not find a place to stay?  She doesn't have to endure hardship with you. Stay on my ship! Food, drink, everything provided, do as you please! I'll even find a tutor for the young girl, teaching her to read and write, securing her future…"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stop. "Rest assured, my medicine will restore your vitality and bring you back to your prime. However, all medicine has side effects. At your age, you should be more moderate."</p><p>The merchant’s face flushed crimson. He chuckled awkwardly. "I was young and foolish, not understanding the dangers… You really insist on leaving?"</p><p>Qin Sang landed, looked back at the wide river, and said meaningfully, "The Fuchun River's scenery is lovely, but once is enough."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang and his horse blended into the crowd.</p><p>The merchant and everyone on board watched until Qin Sang was out of sight.</p><p>…</p><p>Two months remained until the Lei Xiao Assembly.</p><p>Qin Sang, unhurried, traveled with Xiao Wu, enjoying the scenery, arriving at the old site of the Lei Xiao Sect three days before the Lei Xiao Assembly.</p><p>The Lei Xiao Sect was located in the western borderlands of Ji Country, a wild and untamed region.</p><p>West of Ji Country lay many mountains, sparsely populated.  One had to cross vast stretches of wilderness before reaching another country.  </p><p>For the mortal world, this area posed little border pressure; only banditry was a concern.  </p><p>The spirit world, however, had to guard against cultivators and yokai from the mountains descending to cause trouble.  </p><p>Recently, three city gods, with their armies, had arrived to stand guard.</p><p>In its heyday, the Lei Xiao Sect was not only the largest sect in Ji Country, but also held significant influence in neighboring countries, with few rivals.</p><p>The Lei Xiao Sect occupied an entire mountain range. After its dissolution, numerous large and small factions scattered throughout the mountains emerged.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang did not openly reveal himself.</p><p>As the Lei Xiao Assembly drew near, sects like the Wu Hui Gate established strict checkpoints at the foot of the mountains.</p><p>All those entering the mountains had to prove their identity and connection to the Lei Xiao Sect to be granted entry.</p><p>The cultivators in the mountains had a maximum cultivation level of Yuan Ying stage, so naturally, no one could detect Qin Sang.</p><p>Before even reaching the assembly location, Qin Sang had already investigated the entire program.</p><p>It turned out that someone had unearthed a treasure at a certain old site of the Lei Xiao Sect, along with what appeared to be the entrance to a hidden realm.</p><p>This hidden realm was not recorded in the Lei Xiao Sect's annals, and none of the Lei Xiao Sect's descendants knew of it.</p><p>News of the hidden realm spread, attracting the covetous eyes of countless individuals, with the descendants of the Lei Xiao Sect being the most eager.</p><p>After all, many scriptures and treasures were scattered after the fall of the Lei Xiao Sect, some still missing; among them were significant treasures, and many suspected they were hidden in a secret realm.</p><p>This almost triggered a bloody conflict.  The Wu Hui Gate and two other major sects expelled outsiders.  After much deliberation, they decided to hold a Lei Xiao Assembly every sixty years, sending disciples into the hidden realm; cultivation was limited to the Foundation Establishment stage or below.</p><p>Disciples inside were allowed to fight, each relying on their own abilities. Whatever treasures they brought out, others could not covet.</p><p>However, sects like the Wu Hui Gate would offer rewards.  If independent cultivators or cultivating families obtained valuable treasures from the hidden realm and were willing to offer them, they could directly join the sect.</p><p>For independent cultivators without a sect to join, this was undoubtedly a chance to rise in status, making the Lei Xiao Assembly a "Heaven Ascension Assembly."</p><p>Qin Sang stood on a rock, looking at the bustling mountain peak opposite.  </p><p>The entrance to the hidden realm was on the opposite peak.</p><p>His gaze fell on the outer perimeter, focusing on the young cultivators wearing rough robes, appearing timid and anxious yet full of anticipation; it was like looking at his younger self.</p><p>This trip down the mountain stirred many distant memories.</p><p>In the final two days, fewer and fewer people entered the mountains.</p><p>On the day of the Lei Xiao Assembly.</p><p>In the early morning.</p><p>Muffled thunder echoed from the west, the wind and clouds surged, and a treasure ship and a huge golden eagle arrived together, namely the Man Lei Sect and Jin Du Mountain.</p><p>A powerful pressure descended, instantly silencing the mountains.</p><p>At that moment, an elder slowly rose, resisting the pressure – the Wu Hui Gate's master.</p><p>All parties gathered, and the Lei Xiao Assembly began.</p><p>The ceremony was simple. Half an hour later, the disciples who would enter the hidden realm were brought before a stone wall.</p><p>The entrance to the hidden realm was there!</p><p>The three sect masters jointly cast spells to open the hidden realm, and the disciples entered one after another.</p><p>The experts of each sect watched the disciples entering the hidden realm with sharp eyes, preventing anyone from creating chaos.</p><p>However, no one noticed Qin Sang and Xiao Wu, who were following behind the crowd.</p><p>The moment one passed through the entrance, the hidden realm would create ripples; the stronger the cultivation, the more intense the ripples.</p><p>This showed that the hidden realm's restrictions were unstable. The three major sects worried that powerful cultivators entering and fighting inside might cause the hidden realm to collapse, hence this method to resolve disputes.</p><p>However, when Qin Sang and Xiao Wu entered the hidden realm, there were no ripples whatsoever.</p><p>Entering the hidden realm meant the start of the slaughter.</p><p>Two Qi Refinement stage youths happened to land in the same place and immediately began to fight.</p><p>Both were independent cultivators, their treasures and spells unremarkable.</p><p>In the end, one youth, with a resolute ferocity, defeated his opponent.  He wiped the blood from his face, sat there for a while before remembering to collect the spoils of war, his expression gradually growing excited.</p><p>Qin Sang stood not far away, silently watching this crude battle.</p><p>"What's so interesting about two little brats!"</p><p>Zhu Que impatiently pouted.</p>
