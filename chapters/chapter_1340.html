Chapter 1332: The True Immortal Palace

Qin Sang and the others arrived beneath the passageway.
The area was a barren hilltop, devoid of any traces of ancient restrictions, which seemed highly unusual in the perilous Sin God Palace.
Qin Sang leaped onto a mountain peak and saw spatial fissures and chaotic spatial currents ahead, along with fragments of ancient restrictions. They were nearing the edge of the Sin God Palace.
He focused his mind, sinking his consciousness into his dantian.
The shard of the Slaughter Sword lay quietly within the embrace of his Nascent Soul.
Having traversed the Sin God Palace, the sword spirit remained unresponsive, indicating that no other shards of the Slaughter Sword were present here.
"It's almost certain that there are no other shards of the Slaughter Sword in the North Star Realm. I'll have to leave this realm and search the other three realms or venture into the Demon Sea," Qin Sang thought to himself.
A wisp of five-colored mist drifted before him.
He reached out to touch it, and the mist dispersed without any peculiar effects.
The five-colored mist permeated the surroundings, continuously flowing out from the Thunder Ring.
Canghong Zhenren cautiously flew beneath the Thunder Ring. After a brief inspection, he let out a soft exclamation, his expression one of surprise.
Everyone was closely watching Canghong Zhenren's actions, and upon seeing his reaction, they grew tense, eagerly asking what had happened.
"The passageway is completely normal," Canghong Zhenren said in a strange tone. "It seems these five-colored mists are drifting in from the other end of the passage..."
The other end of the passage led to the Purple Micro Palace.
Could something have happened in the Purple Micro Palace?
The group exchanged uneasy glances.
"Since the passage is normal, we'll know once we go in!" Zhenyi Daozhang said solemnly.
Everyone gathered at the entrance of the passage.
This passage was different from others. As long as everyone performed the corresponding secret technique, they could all pass through the passage simultaneously and arrive at the Purple Micro Palace. The exit was near the Devil's Cave at the edge of the outer hall, so they didn't have to worry about being ambushed by Old Demon Ye and picked off one by one.
They each summoned their magical treasures, ready to react at any moment, and sat cross-legged in the void.
Qin Sang took out the Demon-Binding Rope, which Qingjun had just handed to him.
He glanced back, noticing that Qingjun and Jingyu hadn't caught up yet.
At that moment, Qingjun and Jingyu were still in the forbidden area.
"This woman's mastery of the puppet arts has likely reached the pinnacle!" Jingyu thought to herself as she watched Qingjun.
At least, among the cultivators she had met, none could rival Qingjun in the art of puppetry.
Because of Qin Sang, they were allies rather than enemies.
But for some reason, Jingyu always felt an indescribable wariness toward Qingjun.
Now, Qin Sang's reputation in the cultivation world was immense, rivaling even Old Demon Ye, and he was even beginning to surpass established powerhouses like Zhenyi Daozhang and Tongyou Mojun.
What was even more remarkable was his youth. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the North Star Realm would soon be Qin Sang's domain.
Qingjun, on the other hand, remained much more low-key.
She had taken on the identity of Leng Yuntian, only revealing her prowess at the Blood Lake, where she held her own against Old Demon Ye. However, in the end, she was outmaneuvered, and Old Demon Ye seized the Jade Bone Brocade Skin, overshadowing her achievements with Qin Sang's exploits.
Still, Qin Sang's strength was evident. His cultivation base wasn't particularly high, but his Thunder Evasion Technique, top-tier magical treasures, powerful demonic flames, puppets, and refined corpses were all undeniable. Once used, they left a lasting impression.
Jingyu recalled her few interactions with Qingjun, always feeling that Qingjun was inscrutable and mysterious. There was no concrete evidence, just an instinctive feeling.
"It must be my imagination. Hiding one's strength in front of Old Demon Ye would be akin to courting death," Jingyu silently mocked herself, thinking that her two centuries of isolation had made her overly suspicious.
As she was lost in thought, Qingjun put away the Azure Luan puppet and flew out of the seal, shaking her head slightly. She had found nothing.
...
At the entrance of the passage.
Qin Sang and the others simultaneously formed hand seals, and talismans composed of spiritual power appeared before them, shimmering with silver light and establishing a connection with the passage.
"Break!"
The moment the talismans were completed, everyone struck the passage simultaneously.
*Crack!*
The talismans shattered into specks of light, half drifting into the passage and the other half falling onto their bodies.
Everyone felt a tightening sensation, and their vision suddenly vanished into darkness as a gentle force pulled them upward. At first, the speed was slow, but it gradually increased.
They had no idea how far they were being pulled.
Finally, Qin Sang felt the pulling force disappear, realizing they had been brought into the Devil's Cave. Just as he was about to activate his magical treasure to prepare for any danger, a deafening roar erupted above them.
It sounded as if the heavens were collapsing and the earth was splitting apart!
Qin Sang's mind shook, and his expression changed slightly.
At that moment, the others also appeared around him, equally shocked by the tremendous noise.
They exchanged glances and quickly flew out of the Devil's Cave, only to find five-colored mist drifting in the void, clearly emanating from the Purple Micro Palace.
The moment they flew out of the Devil's Cave, everyone was stunned by the sight before them.
There was no sign of Old Demon Ye.
But that no longer mattered. They stared in awe and disbelief toward the direction of the Purple Micro Palace's inner hall.
Zhenyi Daozhang and Tongyou Mojun had entered the Purple Micro Palace several times before.
Even Qin Sang was on his third visit.
In the past, the inner hall of the Purple Micro Palace had been very calm, less dangerous than the outer hall. As long as one didn't recklessly enter the forbidden areas, even Golden Core cultivators could move about freely.
The Heavenly Mountain, Sword Scar Mountain, Hanging Garden Palace, Ancient Medicine Garden, Immortal City Ruins...
These forbidden areas were filled with ancient restrictions, but they were stable, their power never manifesting outwardly.
Now, everything was different!
The inner hall was extremely unstable, the void trembling violently. All the ancient restrictions had been activated, their power revealed. The hidden secret realms and forbidden areas were now fully exposed.
The Immortal City had been flattened by a single hand, leaving behind a massive palm print. The remnants of the ancient restrictions had been triggered, creating an illusion of the Immortal City. Though it was shattered, one could still glimpse the grandeur of the peerless Immortal City!
At Sword Scar Mountain, an illusionary realm had emerged, covering the surrounding mountains. Yet, a world-shaking sword energy shot into the sky, shattering the illusion with a force that seemed capable of splitting the clouds.
In the Ancient Medicine Garden, mysterious lights formed protective domes, each covering a large area of spiritual fields. Within them, faint glimmers of treasure light could be seen, clearly indicating the presence of rare spiritual medicines that had gone unnoticed before.
At the center of the Ancient Medicine Garden, a secret realm had materialized out of thin air. Within it, a spiritual tree with a canopy like clouds stretched across the sky, sheltering the broken secret realm. Inside, life flourished, and mist swirled, creating an air of profound mystery.
Qin Sang recognized this placeâ€”it was the Hanging Garden Palace, the mysterious land that had birthed the Wandering Sage and the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid. He had once considered exploring the Hanging Garden Palace!
And then, he saw another ruined palace.
The Gathering God Hall had also appeared. It was from the Immortal Platform of the Gathering God Hall that he had obtained the Three Lights Jade Liquid.
At the peak of the Heavenly Mountain, strange phenomena were occurring. Shadows of an Immortal Palace flickered in and out of existence, indistinguishable from reality, resembling the Immortal Palace atop the Seven Slaughter Hall.
...
These were just the tip of the iceberg within the inner hall. Whether they had been discovered before or had remained hidden, all the secret realms were now revealed to the world.
This was the true Immortal Palace!
The true Purple Micro Palace!
Everyone was utterly shocked, unable to believe their eyes.
One cultivator murmured, "Could this be the work of Old Demon Ye and the demonic beings?"
