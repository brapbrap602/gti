<h1>Chapter 353: Explanation</h1><p>At this moment, the elder also noticed Qin Sang, who was also at the Foundation Establishment stage, and looked over cautiously.</p><p>Qin Sang paid no mind to the warning in the elder's eyes. He took a step forward, removed his cloak, and said, "Fellow Daoist Han, do you still remember me?"</p><p>"家主, be careful!"</p><p>The elder, who had been wary of Qin Sang, saw his movement and immediately jumped in front of Patriarch Han.</p><p>So he had become the Patriarch of the Han Clan.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped and looked at Patriarch Han.</p><p>As they say, one's demeanor changes with their position. Compared to the naivety of their first encounter, Patriarch Han now possessed the dignity of a leader.</p><p>He vaguely remembered that back then, Han's cultivation wasn't high either, nearly dying together with a demonic cultivator. Now, he was the head of a clan.</p><p>Qin Sang himself had relied on the Yama Banner for cultivation, skipped the Foundation Establishment process with the Dragon Ginseng, and consumed a thousand-year-old spirit herb to reach his current cultivation.</p><p>This person's talent must be considerable.</p><p>"General Qin!"</p><p>Patriarch Han clearly remembered Qin Sang. A look of pleasant surprise appeared on his face, and he hurriedly reached out to stop the elder.</p><p>"Elder Liu, please calm down! General Qin saved my life!"</p><p>Patriarch Han stepped past Elder Liu and hurried forward, his face full of joy. "General Qin, is it really you? When did you return to the Gloomy Mountain Market? Why haven't we heard from you all these years…"</p><p>Mid-sentence, Patriarch Han's expression froze. He finally noticed something was amiss. Not only had Qin Sang's appearance barely changed, but his cultivation was practically on par with his own!</p><p>At the same time, he also saw the Shaohua Mountain token Qin Sang had taken out.</p><p>"Shaohua Mountain? Fellow Daoist Qin... are you a disciple of Shaohua Mountain now?" Patriarch Han's voice was filled with shock, but his brows gradually furrowed.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I was fortunate enough to obtain a Sword Intent Decree from Shaohua Mountain. By a twist of fate, I became a disciple. I happened to be passing by Gloomy Mountain Market and came in for a nostalgic visit. I didn't expect to run into Fellow Daoist Han."</p><p>Patriarch Han's brows were tightly knitted. He had a vague guess and murmured, "Fellow Daoist Qin, your spirit root…"</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation was clearly displayed for all to see; he was undoubtedly at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>But he remembered very clearly that during the Great Sui Dynasty's Crane Seal Ceremony, when the Holy Emperor was being appointed, Zhen Ming, on his behalf, had gone to test Qin Sang's talent. The reported conclusion was clearly no spirit root!</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang, with his heart set on the Dao, had pleaded bitterly, causing further complications.</p><p>If he truly had no spirit root, how could he have been accepted into Shaohua Mountain, and with such high cultivation?</p><p>Unless…</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in affirmation, looked into Patriarch Han's eyes, and said calmly, "I do indeed possess a spirit root, but my talent is not exceptional. Back then... perhaps Fellow Daoist Zhen was negligent and failed to detect it."</p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p>Patriarch Han declared flatly.</p><p>A cultivator making a mistake on something as simple as detecting a spirit root? This cultivator was a joke!</p><p>Patriarch Han's face was filled with killing intent, and a cold glint flickered in his eyes.</p><p>Despite his composure, he could barely suppress the burning rage in his chest.</p><p>One part was shame towards Qin Sang, and the other was anger at being deceived.</p><p>Patriarch Han turned to the elder and said, "Elder Liu, you are in charge of the rest. If there aren't enough men, use my authority as Patriarch to mobilize the clan elders. I must return to Han Manor immediately."</p><p>The elder was completely bewildered, but seeing his Patriarch's furious expression, he dared not speak further and immediately obeyed.</p><p>"As you command, Patriarch."</p><p>Then, Patriarch Han took a deep breath, forcibly suppressing his anger, and looked at Qin Sang with deep apology, saying sincerely, "Fellow Daoist Qin, it was my fault back then! I never imagined he would dare to act so audaciously... If you have time, Fellow Daoist Qin, could you come back to the Han Manor with me? I will give you an explanation!"</p><p>Qin Sang had been observing Patriarch Han's expression. Seeing that he didn't seem to be feigning, he thought for a moment and agreed.</p><p>Qin Sang was also very curious why Zhen Ming would harm him, as they had no prior grievances.</p><p>However, his feelings towards Zhen Ming were complex.</p><p>He had nearly had his path to immortality severed by Zhen Ming and should have been furious. But reflecting on his experiences over the years, Qin Sang had to admit that if it weren't for Zhen Ming, he wouldn't be where he was today.</p><p>Because Zhen Ming had declared he had no cultivation talent, he was forced to travel north to Gloomy Mountain Market, eventually joining Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Though he had faced countless hardships and dangers, several times on the brink of death, he had gained his current cultivation and several rare treasures.</p><p>If he had joined the Han Clan back then, he would only have been an outer disciple. Without the Dragon Ginseng and Foundation Establishment Pill, with his talent, he would probably still be stuck at the tenth level of Qi Refinement in his sixties or seventies.</p><p>Then, facing reality, he would give up on immortality, marry, have children, and die of old age in Han Manor, living a mediocre life.</p><p>At most, he would live a few decades longer than an ordinary person.</p><p>He would never have the boundless possibilities that lay before him now.</p><p>Fate was truly a strange thing.</p><p>They left Gloomy Mountain Market, and Patriarch Han gave a few more instructions to his subordinates. He then summoned a flying boat, invited Qin Sang aboard, and sped off towards the southwest.</p><p>They finally had time to catch up on the flying boat.</p><p>"When Fellow Daoist Qin rescued me, I was left severely injured and near death after fighting the demonic cultivator. Not only was I critically wounded and my spiritual energy depleted, but I had also exhausted all my medicinal pills.</p><p>I relied on those few Dewdrop Pills to barely cling to life, managing to return to my clan and ask the elders to help me. I spent eight years in secluded cultivation to recover.</p><p>The Great Sui's Holy Emperor appointment ceremony took place during a critical period of my recovery.</p><p>Had I known, I would have risked a relapse and personally gone down the mountain. I would never have entrusted the matter to that villain Zhen Ming!"</p><p>Patriarch Han lamented, his voice filled with anguish.</p><p>Qin Sang knew Patriarch Han was telling the truth. Although he hadn't been very knowledgeable back then, he could tell that Patriarch Han's injuries had been extremely serious.</p><p>He must have been trying to appear strong, likely to avoid alarming any mortals who might have noticed.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Han, Fellow Daoist Zhen Ming and I were strangers. I was always cautious and hadn't offended him. He shouldn't have had any reason to harm me," Qin Sang said pointedly.</p><p>Patriarch Han's expression darkened. After pondering for a long time, he slowly shook his head. "To be honest with Fellow Daoist Qin, although there is competition within Han Manor, the family traditions are decent. Everything is based on strength, and there aren't many schemes or conspiracies.</p><p>Moreover, Zhen Ming and his close relatives wouldn't, and couldn't, oppose my lineage. He has always known the rules and never acted out of line.</p><p>That's why I trusted him to bring you in, never imagining he would dare to act so audaciously and do such a thing behind my back."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang nodded slightly. It made sense. Zhen Ming targeting him wouldn't affect the competition for the Patriarch's position. Ultimately, strength reigns supreme in the cultivation world.</p><p>Since there was no clan feud involved, it seemed likely that Zhen Ming had acted on a whim.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel frustrated. He had always been cautious. How had he offended Zhen Ming?</p>
