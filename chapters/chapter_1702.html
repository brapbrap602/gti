<h1>Chapter 1693: Reunion</h1><p>“His spirit fire possesses the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator.  Aren't you tempted, Elder Monk?” the Qinghu Saint King questioned.</p><p>“Although I was unable to focus my attention at the time and did not perceive the aura of the spirit fire, from their descriptions, it should be a demonic fire, wouldn't you agree?”  慧光 Saint perceived the Qinghu Saint King's intentions at a glance.</p><p>The formula for the Soul-镇静 incense and the South Bright 離火 were both things she desperately wanted.  It was Qin Sang's misfortune to possess such treasures.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King fell silent.</p><p>慧光 Saint didn't press further, instead advising, “Unless this fire can be refined by the Saint King, greatly increasing their cultivation and abilities, it would be unwise to pursue it. If it's merely for an additional means of defense, the fire's power is too volatile to control. Recklessly using it in Gui Xu could cause violent fluctuations, potentially attracting a swarm of beasts and placing us in even greater danger. This person is already a frightened bird; we cannot use force. Saint King, please heed my words and avoid unnecessary complications.”</p><p>The East Sea Gui Xu, a place where ferocious beasts roam.</p><p>Even before the Heavenly Demon Sound caused the beasts to rampage, Gui Xu was an extremely dangerous place.  Even Nascent Soul cultivators would only venture there as a last resort, after making thorough preparations.</p><p>Now, with the beasts driven mad by the Demon Sound, who knows what awaits within their lairs?</p><p>During the East Crossing Ascension, ferocious beasts are one of the greatest threats.</p><p>Especially within Gui Xu, they might be able to handle a single beast, but a direct confrontation could attract many more.</p><p>“If I could subdue the spirit and control this treasure, I wouldn’t need to seek anything else,” the Qinghu Saint King looked at the Five Elements Crown atop the demonic body, her tone softening.</p><p>Of course, she also understood that having missed this opportunity, recapturing that person would be difficult.</p><p>Unless she and the Elder Monk went themselves, anyone else who encountered him would be courting death.</p><p>If there was the slightest disturbance, if that person sensed danger and vanished or even fled Zhongzhou to find refuge in the storm belt, would they forgo ascension and remain in Zhongzhou until they found him?</p><p>The Elder Monk is a local expert; finding that person would still require the power of the Buddhist sect.</p><p>The most pressing matter now is to help suppress the demonic body's frenzy, restore some of its intelligence, extract information, and use the demonic body to test some previous hypotheses and investigate the Heavenly Demon Sound.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Several monks rushed towards the broken mountain.</p><p>The multicolored clouds revealed other colored lights, indicating that the Five Elements Divine Restriction hadn't completely destroyed all the formations on the mountain. They were ordered to salvage the remaining treasures of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Other Buddhist experts were also scattered throughout the various locations of the legacy estate, driving away uninvolved individuals.</p><p>Unfortunately, manpower was insufficient, and with the unexpected occurrences, the demonic body had only just shown signs of defeat when those people scattered, and the legacy estate's passages continued to expand, now covering nearly half of the Taiyue mountain range. The legacy estate is about to resurface.  慧光 Saint's plan to capture everyone was impossible; they could only secure control of the legacy estate for now.</p><p>In the sky.</p><p>The Poison King emerged from the gray cocoon, having escaped death, surveying the mountain range of the legacy estate, his eyes flickering.</p><p>He had just learned from Yue Lingtian about the events that transpired during his captivity, feeling both relief and anxiety.</p><p>He was relieved that he had previously favored a trade, not forming a deadly feud with that person. He was anxious, however, about how to retrieve the Gu King from such a powerful individual.</p><p>Mo Xingdao regulated his breathing while observing the Qinghu Saint King and 慧光 Saint, then glanced at others, discreetly backing away, when suddenly a voice transmission reached his ears, causing him to freeze.</p><p>…</p><p>“I’m injured and unable to rise to greet you. Please excuse me.”</p><p>In a crude stone mansion carved into a desolate mountain corner, Qin Sang stopped his healing, looking at  琉璃 who entered, a faint smile on his pale face.</p><p>It was clear that smiling was difficult for him; he strained his mouth.</p><p>His avatar had sent 琉璃 and left quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang explained, “My avatar previously disguised itself as the ancestor of the Xie family of Pushan.  This time, my identity was exposed, provoking a demon Saint King, which could bring disaster to the Xie family. I have several friends still in Pushan; they don't know about what happened here and need to be warned quickly, so that they can prepare.”</p><p>Before the rumors spread, the fastest way was through the Six States Hall, but whether it would be in time was unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang could only do his best and leave the rest to fate.</p><p>With the Ghost Mother there, things should be properly handled.</p><p>琉璃 nodded subtly, seeing the severity of Qin Sang's injuries. "What are your plans next?"</p><p>"Naturally, to find a place to heal…"</p><p>Qin Sang pulled at his lips, but this caused his injuries to flare, nearly making him gasp in pain.</p><p>He managed to keep a smile on his face, gazing at Liuli.  She wore simple monastic robes; though her head was covered, he could still see strands of dark hair peeking from beneath the hood.</p><p>Her lay attire not only failed to conceal Liuli's striking beauty but instead added a touch of elegance and serenity, softening her usual coldness and making her seem far less distant.</p><p>Qin Sang felt an inexplicable sense of relief.</p><p>Years ago, Liuli had cut her hair, a decisive act signifying her departure, and he'd thought he would never see her again.</p><p>Seeing her familiar face, he blurted out, "Thank goodness you didn't actually become a nun."</p><p>Liuli remained silent, her gaze cold.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly fell silent, giving a nervous laugh.  In his current state, it was best not to be too bold; otherwise, Liuli could easily dispose of him with a single strike.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed Liuli's cultivation was still at the mid-Yuan Ying stage, but her aura was nearly comparable to a perfected incarnation, indicating she was at the peak of mid-Yuan Ying.</p><p>"Your cultivation...?"</p><p>Realizing Liuli could still sense him, he knew the lingering effects of the demonic technique hadn't been resolved. Was she stuck at a bottleneck again?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but worry.</p><p>Liuli said calmly, "When the Legacy Mansion appeared, I sensed an opportunity for a breakthrough and was preparing to enter seclusion."</p><p>Guessing what Qin Sang wanted to ask, Liuli paused, looked at him, and said, "You can shield the imprint."</p><p>They had both studied the *Mysterious Mother Jade Cauldron Scripture*. Qin Sang had taken the lead, holding the dominant position.</p><p>Although she was suppressing the imprint with all her might, Qin Sang could, if he wished, easily undo her efforts with a single thought and uncover the imprint's secret.</p><p>The fact that Qin Sang seemed completely unaware of this could only mean he had never even considered doing so. Even during their confrontation with Yin Changsheng in the Sacred Land, when she had willingly opened her mind, Qin Sang had only borrowed her true essence to control the Sun God Tree and immediately severed the connection without any unnecessary thoughts or actions.</p><p>"It's best to find a way to remove the imprint as soon as possible!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>Judging by Liuli's tone, her Buddhist practice had yielded significant results but didn't seem sufficient to completely eliminate the hidden danger.</p><p>Since the topic of breakthroughs had come up, Qin Sang took a jade orb from his Qianjun Ring and offered it to Liuli.</p><p>The orb, about the size of a baby's fist, emitted a pure, bright green light, shimmering like a night pearl. It was full of countless tiny cavities, nested within each other. However, some parts seemed incomplete, unfinished.</p><p>The orb was the Heavenly Linglong Embryo.</p><p>Liuli didn't take it, but her gaze was drawn to the Heavenly Linglong, sensing it was no ordinary object.</p><p>Qin Sang explained, "This is called the Heavenly Linglong. I obtained it from an opponent. It's a treasure created by a master of the Wood element, and it can assist in breaking through to the Transcendence stage.  In ascending to Transcendence, the connection between heaven and man is crucial, deeply linked to one's spiritual roots… As you know, I have five spiritual roots, so this is useless to me. I don't lack treasures to aid breakthroughs. I plan to trade this and a Five Elements Pill with Mo Xingdao for a Spirit-Perceiving Immortal Fruit, but I don't know if he can even escape."</p><p>Then, Qin Sang produced a wooden box, revealing a cyan luminous sphere containing the Heavenly Linglong's secret techniques.</p><p>Liuli used her spiritual sense to examine the sphere's contents, her expression changing.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Liuli shook her head. "It's a simple matter for me."</p><p>Her disposition hadn't changed at all!</p><p>Despite all his efforts, he still couldn't persuade Liuli.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, "It may be a simple matter for you, but it's a life-saving grace for me. Besides, you took a huge risk helping me. You've practiced Buddhism, surely you know that your strict vigilance is attachment, and letting things happen naturally is the right path."</p><p>Liuli remained firm, only making a copy of the contents of the sphere. "I haven't broken through to late Yuan Ying yet; I have plenty of time to gather materials and refine the Heavenly Linglong. Since the Moon Laurel Celestial Dew once appeared in Central Plains, it hasn't completely disappeared; it might still be found."</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, but ultimately put the Heavenly Linglong Embryo away.</p><p>"In that case, I'll keep this for you for now. Also, I have one Soul-Subduing Incense stick left. If you need it, just ask."</p><p>Liuli remained noncommittal.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't push it further, changing the subject. "What faction have you joined? Will today's events have any negative consequences?"</p><p>The exposure of the teleportation passage would also reveal the faction's connection to the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>If it triggered any repercussions, the sect might take its anger out on Liuli.</p><p>"The Yan Yue Nunnery. Our founding ancestor was once married to an elder of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. After the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's destruction, its members went into seclusion, and when they travel outside, they use other identities to conceal themselves…"</p><p>Liuli briefly explained the origins of the Yan Yue Nunnery.</p><p>The Elder</p><p>Learning that the Yanyue Monastery's abbess stemmed from the Water Affinity lineage and had deep roots in the Gold Affinity lineage, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  She quickly produced several items.</p><p>These included jade scrolls obtained from Bingyi Palace, recording the Water Affinity Hall's inheritance:  "Taiyi Hidden Water," "Lightless Shield," "Yuanji Divine Wheel," and "Smoke-Mist Shadowless Phantom Body," amongst others.</p><p>There was also the gold sword obtained from Di Shou Mountain, containing the Gold Affinity Hall's sword array inheritance.</p><p>Qin Sang gave everything to Liuli, leaving the arrangements to her.</p><p>After reviewing the contents of the scrolls and sword, Liuli glanced at Qin Sang, unexpectedly impressed by the richness of her harvest from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>This time, Liuli didn't refuse.</p><p>She feigned a return to the Secret Hall to retrieve treasures, actually to rescue Qin Sang. The old nun saw through her, yet instead of anger, offered assistance.  Ultimately, they failed to retrieve the treasures from the Secret Hall.</p><p>This favor needed to be repaid.</p><p>Returning the inheritances of both lineages provided a suitable reciprocation.</p><p>Perhaps due to their long separation and resultant estrangement, after these formal matters, Qin Sang found herself at a loss for words.  Liuli, naturally reserved and cold, didn't initiate conversation.</p><p>Silence filled the cave dwelling.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang looked beyond the cave entrance.  "My clone should soon reach the nearby Liu Zhou Hall.  Immortal, do you know who is currently at the Xie family residence?"</p><p>Without expecting Liuli to offer a conversational opening, Qin Sang answered her own question.  "I originally journeyed north to Jinyu State for the Ullambana Festival, unexpectedly encountering Elder Guimu there.  Being able to arrive at the Legacy Mansion before its opening was due to her guidance. I was originally headed for the Central State Immortal Palace, but the route was blocked. Judging by the Eight Scenery Purple Thunder Realperson's actions, they must have ascended."</p><p>Hearing "Guimu," Liuli's eyes flickered.  "Ya Gu?"</p><p>Finally, a response!</p><p>It was commendable that she still remembered Ya Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted. She smiled, "My previous efforts weren't in vain.  Elder Guimu examined Ya Gu, and her condition is well-maintained. The Elder is currently assisting her, and the Heavenly Corpse Talisman should be removed, awakening her."</p><p>Liuli seemed touched by Qin Sang's smile, her expression softening slightly. She softly said, "Congratulations."</p><p>Qin Sang understood that she must have remembered her master.</p><p>In a way, they were both bound by obsessions. His was about to be resolved, while Liuli's and her master's separation was seemingly endless.</p><p>"Immortal, rest assured, your master is blessed and will surely overcome this peril.  During my encounter with Elder Guimu, I learned many secrets…"</p><p>Qin Sang spoke rapidly, detailing everything she'd learned from Guimu.</p><p>"The Ascension Platform leads to the Demon Realm, but the Immortal Palace and the Ascension Platform are likely not connected...The Immortal Palace's ascension was grand and imposing.  Unless someone in the upper realms orchestrated a cover-up, news would have spread. Elder Guimu is preparing for ascension. I will ask her to investigate upon arrival in the upper realms.  Perhaps she can find your master, and even lend assistance. After we ascend, we will visit Elder Guimu in the Witch Clan."</p><p>"Ascension…"</p><p>Liuli appeared lost in thought, yet a flicker of anticipation appeared in her eyes.</p><p>This expectation was the driving force behind her relentless efforts.</p><p>With no sign of her clone's return, Qin Sang decided not to wait longer and suggested leaving, boldly requesting protection. "To avoid unnecessary trouble, Immortal, would you escort me again?"</p><p>Learning that the Qiling Cave Master also perished at Qin Sang's hands, Liuli remained silent.</p><p>How long had they been in Central State? This person seemed to have enemies everywhere.</p><p>The Qiling Cave Master was infamous in the Southern Barbarian states, known for his mastery of ghost arts and unpredictable abilities. Once targeted, death was certain, often a slow and agonizing one.</p><p>Even sects like Wan Du Mountain and Taiyue Gate avoided this formidable cultivator.</p><p>After reaching peak cultivation, he rarely appeared, but his reputation remained undiminished.</p><p>To have died so quietly here was unexpected.</p><p>Qin Sang intended to visit the Qiling Cave Master's cave dwelling, though not the obvious one.</p><p>This person had multiple hideouts. His medicine garden was located in the most secret dwelling, unknown even to his disciples.  Perhaps healing herbs could be found there to expedite recovery.</p><p>He could also recuperate in the Qiling Cave Master's residence for a while, but proximity to the Poison King wasn't ideal in the long run.</p><p>After consuming some pills, Qin Sang could manage to move.</p><p>The Qiling Cave Master's cave dwelling was located in an uninhabited area of Man State. The two traveled southwest.  The Southern Barbarian states were rife with poisonous miasmas, sparsely populated, minimizing the risk of detection.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang recounted her experiences over the years, learning that Liuli originally sought a Buddhist temple in the Western Desert for quiet contemplation, unexpectedly encountering the Abbess during her travels.</p><p>They journeyed together through the Western Desert, forming a bond. Liuli accepted her invitation to join the Yanyue Monastery, and under the Abbess's guidance, chose to practice monastic life while retaining her hair.  Since then, she hadn't left the monastery.</p>
