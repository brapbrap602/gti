<h1>Chapter 447: Selling Corpses</h1><p>It should be noon, but Fog Island was even darker than the waters of Turmoil Archipelago.  Through the heavy fog, the shape of an island was barely visible.</p><p>Fog Island, despite its small size and narrow streets, had a larger population than Big Island. Cultivators hurried to and fro, creating a sense of congestion.</p><p>Qin Sang, now clad in a black robe, observed for a moment before landing on the island. He blended into the crowd and walked to the entrance of a large shop.</p><p>"A senior awaits you…"</p><p>Inside the shop stood numerous young women, all at the Qi Refining stage.  They seemed unfazed by Qin Sang's attire.</p><p>As he entered, a young woman greeted him warmly with a smile and led him into a private room, activating the privacy formation.</p><p>With a respectful bow, she inquired, "What treasures does Senior wish to buy or sell? Our shop offers talismans, pills, cultivation techniques…"</p><p>Qin Sang, familiar with the establishment, cut her short with a wave of his hand. In a hoarse voice, he uttered two words: "Selling corpses."</p><p>He opened the corpse puppet bag beneath his robe, releasing nine refined corpses that lined up behind him.</p><p>Each corpse wore an identical silver mask, concealing faces that Qin Sang had marred.</p><p>Pairs of jet-black eyes peered through the mask's openings, radiating an eerie and unsettling gaze.</p><p>An aura of death emanated from the corpses.</p><p>The temperature in the room plummeted, and a chilling air pervaded the space.</p><p>These corpses were the remains of Qin Sang's recent adversaries.  Those with intact bodies and undamaged core seas were refined into Death Corpses, although the highest cultivation among them was only mid-Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Qin Sang kept the corpses refined from late-Foundation Establishment cultivators, as well as the Living Corpse, for himself.</p><p>With cultivators from the two regions at war, especially in the later stages, venturing out alone was rare. Most traveled in groups. Qin Sang preferred to keep his corpse refinement abilities secret.</p><p>While he could summon one or two corpses in times of crisis, he couldn't keep them with him constantly.  That would be indistinguishable from demonic practices.</p><p>He couldn't explain it to his sect.</p><p>The war naturally resulted in numerous casualties. These accumulated corpses were of little immediate use to Qin Sang.  He decided to sell the weaker ones to obtain cultivation resources.</p><p>Fog Island was the ideal place for such a transaction.</p><p>Despite Qin Sang's shocking display, the young woman showed little fear, as if selling corpses was commonplace.</p><p>Indeed, it was.</p><p>In the cultivation world, cultivators of demonic or ghostly arts often traded in refined corpses, spirits, ghost lords, and so on.  This was no different from puppet masters selling spiritual puppets or beast tamers selling spirit beasts.</p><p>Refined corpses were simply another commodity.</p><p>However, in the Small Cold Region, sects specializing in puppetry were few and obscure, while demonic cultivation was relatively prevalent.</p><p>The young woman, clearly not a stranger to corpse sales, only blinked in surprise at the sheer number of corpses Qin Sang offered.</p><p>"Fetch a steward to appraise these corpses for me," Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>The young woman's eyes darted across the nine corpses. Just as she turned to leave, she froze, her eyes lighting up with surprise.  "Please wait a moment, Senior," she whispered, then hurried away, nearly tripping in her haste and forgetting to close the door.</p><p>Her unusual behavior didn't escape Qin Sang's notice.</p><p>He frowned, turning back to the corpses.  With their faces obscured by masks and identical black robes, it was impossible to distinguish them, even for a Foundation Establishment expert, let alone the young woman.</p><p>There was only one possible explanation: Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>This was the key difference between Qin Sang's corpses and others.  The Heavenly Corpse Sect used Earthly Yin Qi for refinement, while most demonic cultivators used regular Yin Qi.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his finger on the table, a thoughtful expression on his face. Before he could react further, hurried footsteps approached from outside.</p><p>He shifted his gaze towards the door, watching as a rotund figure filled the doorway, entering with a beaming smile.</p><p>Such obesity was rare among cultivators. The doorway barely accommodated him.</p><p>"Greetings, fellow Daoist. I am Steward Bao, at your service," the portly steward greeted, bowing with a nod that was barely a bend at the waist.</p><p>"Steward Bao, I recognize you." This man was not ordinary. He should not be underestimated.</p><p>Qin Sang returned the greeting. "I merely wished to sell a few refined corpses. I didn't expect to trouble Steward Bao himself."</p><p>"You are indeed an old friend!" Steward Bao smiled, seating himself before Qin Sang and glancing at the corpses. "Your refined corpses are quite unique.  Refining with Earthly Yin Qi... I've never seen another like it. That's why you made such an impression."</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, feigning displeasure. "Is Steward Bao investigating me? Or does refining with Earthly Yin Qi offend you?"</p><p>"Not at all, not at all…" Steward Bao waved his hands dismissively. "Please don't misunderstand...  Ah! Let me be frank! You've sold refined corpses here before. This is your private matter, and I've never had any intention of investigating you. However, some time ago, I encountered a Death Corpse quite similar to these, yet different.  I wished to ask you about it."</p><p>Qin Sang realized the steward's purpose.  "Are you referring to the Living Corpse I presented at the auction?"</p><p>"The Living Corpse! Yes! Precisely!" Steward Bao nodded vigorously.  "The name is apt.  That Living Corpse possessed far greater sentience than these refined corpses. Quite remarkable!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. "Are you interested in Living Corpses?"</p><p>Six months prior, he had attended an auction on Fog Island, seeking a high-quality spirit herb that could enhance cultivation. Short on funds but determined to acquire it, he had offered a Living Corpse in exchange, ultimately securing the herb.</p><p>That was the only time he had revealed the Living Corpse's existence. Unexpectedly, it had caught someone's attention.</p><p>Steward Bao didn't hesitate to admit his interest, leaning forward slightly.  "Forgive my boldness, but how many Living Corpses do you possess? And what is the strongest among them?"</p><p>"Surely you know such questions are private." Qin Sang scoffed. "However, I'll answer you. Refining such Living Corpses is extremely difficult. I only had that one, which I traded for the spirit herb. As for its strength, it was comparable to these refined corpses.  If you're interested in purchasing, I have other high-quality refined corpses. I'm willing to part with a few for a fair price."</p>
