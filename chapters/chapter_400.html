<h1>Chapter 393: Talisman Prohibition</h1><p>A battered figure was speeding through the passage.</p><p>Black flames pursued relentlessly behind him. Yu Hua was closing in. Qin Sang flew without looking back, his expression changing constantly.</p><p>At this moment, he held an object in his palm, a gray jade-like rectangular talisman paper. Mysterious light pulsed from it, captivating the eye.</p><p>The Ice Palace was just ahead.</p><p>The pursuer was close behind.</p><p>And the little spiritual power he had just recovered in his Qi Sea was only enough to barely maintain the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, which was already exhausted.</p><p>Time did not allow him to hesitate any longer.</p><p>A decisive glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. He suddenly raised his other hand and, with practiced ease, cast a series of restrictions, all of which landed on himself.</p><p>These were the restrictions from the *Tianyin Corpse Scripture*, used in conjunction with the Celestial Corpse Talisman. Some of them were learned from Wu Shang's notes, with some modifications.</p><p>Qin Sang never thought that one day he would use them on himself.</p><p>He had already memorized them thoroughly, his movements were very fast, and he completed them in one go. Then he flipped his palm and, without hesitation, imprinted the Celestial Corpse Talisman onto his forehead.</p><p>Within the primordial spirit space.</p><p>The Celestial Corpse Talisman floated towards his primordial spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang shuddered and, at that very moment, rushed into the Ice Palace.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang fell to the ground, his vision suddenly blacking out, a bluish-black ghost hand filling his sight.</p><p>Fortunately, the ghost hand stopped abruptly in front of his forehead. Through the gaps between its fingers, Qin Sang saw the struggle in the Flying Yaksha's eyes. Wu Shang's lingering will stopped it again.</p><p>*Whoosh...*</p><p>A fierce wind howled in the passage, black flames billowing. Yu Hua had arrived in pursuit.</p><p>The Flying Yaksha turned its neck to look, then vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, sensing himself. His consciousness had not been affected by the Celestial Corpse Talisman.</p><p>The situation was urgent, and there was no time for a thorough examination.</p><p>Qin Sang sprang to his feet and rushed towards the side chamber where Yun Youzi had entered. He had barely traveled far when he heard the sound of shattering glass and Yu Hua's furious roar from behind.</p><p>Turning his head at the sound, Qin Sang felt a pang of regret.</p><p>As expected, Yu Hua was indeed attacked by the Flying Yaksha, but at the critical moment, a breastplate-like artifact flew out from Yu Hua's chest.</p><p>This artifact not only protected its master automatically but also possessed incredibly strong defensive capabilities. Although shattered by the Flying Yaksha, it actually blocked the Flying Yaksha's fatal sneak attack!</p><p>Yu Hua was completely unharmed!</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>Yu Hua was shocked, his protective artifact shattered by the Flying Yaksha’s claw.</p><p>He quickly realized that the Flying Yaksha wasn't human.</p><p>The corpse poison clinging to the Flying Yaksha's claws made him feel a sense of dread, and he couldn't help but gasp, thankful for the artifact that had shielded him from disaster.</p><p>"How can there be a Flying Yaksha here?"</p><p>In the cultivation world, a refined corpse at the Core Formation stage was called a Flying Yaksha. They were elusive and powerful.</p><p>But it was very difficult for naturally born zombies to evolve into Flying Yakshas. The conditions were extremely harsh, even more difficult than for human cultivators to reach the Core Formation stage, so they were extremely rare.</p><p>Yu Hua hadn't expected to find one here.</p><p>Catching a glimpse of Qin Sang disappearing into the side chamber out of the corner of his eye, Yu Hua was greatly surprised. Why did the Flying Yaksha attack him instead of Qin Sang, who had disturbed it first?</p><p>Could this Flying Yaksha be Qin Sang's corpse puppet?</p><p>Thinking of this, Yu Hua shook his head inwardly. A mere Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivator couldn't possibly have a Flying Yaksha-level corpse puppet. Even if he did, he wouldn't be able to control it.</p><p>Unless there were secrets he didn't know.</p><p>The Flying Yaksha clearly wouldn't give Yu Hua time to ponder. Failing its first strike, it vanished on the spot, reappearing behind Yu Hua.</p><p>A sense of foreboding arose in Yu Hua's heart, and he hurriedly dodged.</p><p>The two figures became a blur.</p><p>Yu Hua dodged with all his might, finally experiencing the terror of the Flying Yaksha. From the sneak attack to now, they had only exchanged a few blows, but he had been close to danger several times.</p><p>He couldn't help but feel exhausted, breaking out in a cold sweat.</p><p>"Nine Nether Demonic Flame!"</p><p>Yu Hua finally found an opportunity. Glaring at the approaching Flying Yaksha, he roared towards the sky. Endless black flames swarmed from the surface of his banner-like magical artifact, threatening to engulf the Flying Yaksha.</p><p>The ghost claws touched the black flames and abruptly retracted. The Flying Yaksha screamed in pain, its figure retreating rapidly as it stared fixedly at the Ten Yama Envoys Banner.</p><p>In its pitch-black eyes, there was an intense fear.</p><p>Yu Hua was somewhat surprised that the Flying Yaksha was so afraid of the Nine Nether Demonic Flame. Overjoyed, he sneered, "A mere corpse ghost dares to act arrogantly before me!"</p><p>Before he could finish his words, the Flying Yaksha vanished again. The sneer on Yu Hua's face instantly disappeared. He looked around, but seeing nothing unusual, he snorted coldly and immediately activated the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, transforming it into a fiery shield that enveloped his entire body.</p><p>At the same time, he deliberately dispersed a portion of the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, transforming it into countless illusory flames that drifted in all directions.</p><p>The next moment, Yu Hua suddenly turned his head, staring at a point in empty space, and roared, "Get out!"</p><p>...</p><p>The animated corpse, left outside by Qin Sang, witnessed this entire scene.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised by the result.</p><p>Even the Soul Threads of the Ten Yama Envoys Formation had some restraining effect on the Flying Yaksha. The Nine Nether Demonic Flame, countless times stronger than the Soul Threads, was very likely the Flying Yaksha’s nemesis.</p><p>The facts proved Qin Sang's guess correct.</p><p>This demonic flame was exceptionally powerful, unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen.</p><p>Yu Hua's strength wasn't enough to kill the Flying Yaksha, but with the help of a magical artifact that could restrain it, he could hold his own.</p><p>Once he figured out the Flying Yaksha and freed himself to deal with him, Qin Sang would be in trouble.</p><p>The Flying Yaksha, fearing the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, was restricted in its movements. Yu Hua wasn't in immediate danger. In this situation, Qin Sang didn't dare, nor did he have the strength, to intervene.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang's internal spiritual power had been overdrawn several times.  He had been relying on spiritual pills to sustain himself. His Qi Sea and meridians were severely damaged and nearing their limit.</p><p>He hurriedly took a healing pill.  Before his injuries recovered, he didn't dare to take any more pills or absorb spiritual stones to replenish his spiritual power, otherwise, he would explode and die before Yu Hua even laid a hand on him.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his anxiety and observed the environment of the side chamber.  After taking it all in, he understood why Yun Youzi needed him to buy time.</p><p>The end of this side chamber wasn't an ice wall, but a barrier formed by restrictions. Inside the restrictions was darkness, nothing could be seen.</p><p>To enter, he would first have to break the restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly turned his head and glanced towards the Ice Palace. The animated corpse he had left outside had been destroyed by Yu Hua!</p><p>Sure enough, Yu Hua was close to figuring out the Flying Yaksha and was dragging it towards him in pursuit.</p><p>This wasn't a desperate situation. He still had a way out, but he needed more time and a quiet environment to recover from his injuries and prepare.</p><p>"Five Elements Sword Break!"</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned with his finger, and five spiritual swords flew out.</p><p>Through years of experience, Qin Sang's mastery of restriction-breaking had advanced by leaps and bounds.  Although not as fast as Yun Youzi, he wouldn't find it too difficult.</p>
