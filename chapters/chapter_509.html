<h1>Chapter 502:  A Meal</h1><p>Chapter 502:  A Meal</p><p>The next morning, after watching the sunrise, Qin Sang returned to the cave, collected the treasures left there, and then resealed the cave's protective barrier, allowing the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid to grow undisturbed.</p><p>Passing by the islet, she didn't see Yun Youzi and Li Yu Fu, so she left a message talisman, making an appointment with Yun Youzi to meet there a month later.</p><p>Yun Youzi was also of unpredictable whereabouts; the two agreed to use the islet as their contact point, and Qin Sang planned to stay longer.</p><p>After that, Qin Sang returned to the Earth-Sinking Cave and summoned the Flying Night Rakshasa from the Earth Fiend Qi.</p><p>The Earth Fiend Qi churned.</p><p>A demonic shadow, seemingly born from the Netherworld, slowly emerged from the Earth Fiend Qi.</p><p>Even upon seeing its master, its face showed no expression.</p><p>It had been almost a year since she had left the Flying Night Rakshasa in the Earth-Sinking Cave to recover on its own; during that time, Qin Sang had focused on preparing for her Golden Core breakthrough and hadn't visited.</p><p>From the outside, the wound on the Flying Night Rakshasa's dantian had closed, and all its external injuries had healed. Its body was no longer as withered as when it was first injured; it seemed to be in good condition.</p><p>However, when Qin Sang probed the Flying Night Rakshasa's Qi Sea with her spiritual sense, she was disappointed to find that the corpse pill was still riddled with cracks and dull.</p><p>It looked almost exactly the same as a year ago.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, carefully examining the Flying Night Rakshasa's Golden Core before realizing it wasn't completely unchanged.  The healing was simply slow, imperceptible unless carefully examined.</p><p>The signs of improvement indicated that the healing method was correct.</p><p>But the recovery speed was too slow!</p><p>"Three years…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, her brows furrowed in worry.</p><p>The Purple Micro Palace would open in three years.</p><p>If she couldn't achieve the Golden Core breakthrough, the Flying Night Rakshasa would be her greatest support in facing danger, so she absolutely had to take it with her.</p><p>"Perhaps it's not impossible…"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly realized she had been thinking wrongly.</p><p>The slow recovery during the first year was due to the severity of the injuries. The initial stage was undoubtedly the most difficult, and the rate of improvement should increase later.</p><p>Moreover, once the Flying Night Rakshasa's injuries were half-healed, she wouldn't have to worry about accidentally destroying its corpse pill and could attempt to control it, allowing it to accelerate its absorption of the Earth Fiend Qi, which might aid its recovery.</p><p>However, this would mean she couldn't rely on the Flying Night Rakshasa's assistance in her plan.</p><p>After the examination, Qin Sang returned the Flying Night Rakshasa to the Earth-Sinking Cave.</p><p>…</p><p>Hui Long Temple.</p><p>Xiang Long Mountain.</p><p>The mist array on the mountainside had persisted for a hundred years, preventing mortals from even approaching, and was considered a fairy trace.</p><p>Legend held that the mountain was the residence of immortals, a sacred mountain known throughout the hundreds of miles, and in the last century, its reputation had spread not only throughout Gu Yuan Kingdom but even beyond.</p><p>Seekers of immortality came in an endless stream.</p><p>In the past hundred years, the villages at the foot of the mountain had grown into a town, and soon, even the town couldn't accommodate so many immortals seekers. The Gu Yuan Kingdom's ruler ordered the construction of a city at the foot of Xiang Long Mountain.</p><p>Over time, a new city sprang up.</p><p>And the ruler personally gave it a popular name—Immortal Fate City.</p><p>Due to its location, Immortal Fate City was very close to Gu Yuan's capital.  As it wasn't strategically important, the sudden appearance of this new city made new merchants curious and eager to ask about it.</p><p>#Send 888 cash red envelopes# Follow vx public account [Book Friend Base Camp] to see popular works and win 888 cash red envelopes!</p><p>Although no one had ever gained immortality from the mountain, countless legends emerged from Immortal Fate City, constantly renewed each year.</p><p>This year, Zhang San was chosen by a master and taken up the mountain; next year, Li Si, for his handsome appearance, was chosen by a fairy as a partner; and then there were stories of young disciples, herbalists, alchemists…</p><p>Countless stories, each a beautiful tale.</p><p>Twists and turns captivated people, making them yearn to take their place.</p><p>In the past, only commoners and immortal seekers would kneel at the foot of the mountain during certain times to pray for divine blessings.</p><p>Five years ago, Gu Yuan Kingdom suddenly designated Xiang Long Mountain as a sacred mountain and erected an altar there.  Every winter solstice, the ruler would personally climb the mountain, despite his advanced age, to offer incense and perform the Heaven-Worshiping ceremony.</p><p>After the ceremony, the ruler would dismiss everyone and remain at the altar for an hour.</p><p>Each time, he would descend the mountain with a look of disappointment.</p><p>This year, just after the winter solstice, unusually, the ceremony was led by the Crown Prince, and snowflakes began to fall on the night of the winter solstice, bringing a sudden chill.</p><p>The land was covered in a blanket of snow.</p><p>The next morning…</p><p>The residents of Xianyuan City were up early, clearing snow from their doorways. Children played in the drifts.  Fewer merchants than usual had entered the city; the streets were sparsely populated, save for a charcoal vendor’s calls.</p><p>Xianyuan City lies west of Xianglong Mountain.  The main street runs directly east-west, connecting the west gate to a straight stone road leading to the capital.</p><p>A young Daoist priest approached from the east.</p><p>He wore a clean, though worn, robe.  The snow had stopped, and some was melting, leaving mud splatters on his gaiters, but this didn't detract from his appearance. He looked young, perhaps only twenty, but possessed a compelling presence.</p><p>This was Qin Sang.</p><p>After returning to Xianglong Mountain and checking the message talismans at Huilong Temple, finding nothing urgent, he remembered Qi Yuanshou’s suggestion. He then went into the city, changed into ordinary robes, and disguised himself as a common Daoist priest.</p><p>He dispensed with his spiritual powers and walked through the slush, unconcerned with the dirt.  He wandered aimlessly, looking left and right, unsure what he sought.</p><p>By now, he realized his descent from the mountain had been ill-timed.  In the biting winter cold, few commoners were out, the streets deserted.  His hope of observing the world was thwarted by the lack of people.</p><p>“Young Daoist…”</p><p>Qin Sang, walking briskly and pondering a trip to the more populous capital, heard a call.</p><p>He looked around; he was the only Daoist priest on the street.  Following the sound, he saw an elderly woman beckoning from a partly open gate of a courtyard.</p><p>She wore a patched but clean, old cotton-padded jacket. Her face was deeply lined; she appeared to be well over seventy, but Qin Sang, with his keen eyes, perceived her true age to be less, her appearance ravaged by hardship.</p><p>“Young Daoist, are you also seeking a celestial being?”</p><p>She took a step forward, slipped on the ice, quickly caught herself on the wall, and continued her invitation warmly.  “You’re down the mountain this early—it must be freezing up there!  And the snow came so early this year! You haven’t eaten, have you? I just finished preparing food. Come in and warm yourself with a meal.”</p><p>Qin Sang, unsure of his direction, changed his mind and nodded, approaching her with a bow.  “Thank you, Madam. I am indeed hungry. I gratefully accept your kind offer.”</p>
