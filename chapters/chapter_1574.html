<h1>Chapter 1565: Luye</h1><p>Chapter 1565: Luye</p><p>Shuo County.</p><p>Located in the northern part of Zhuo Prefecture, bordering Zhaoyao Prefecture, the county is one part mountain and nine parts water.</p><p>The Wen family of Shuo County, whose strongest members are only Golden Core cultivators, holds an extraordinary position in the county, commanding the respect of surrounding forces.</p><p>This is because the Wen family once produced Elder Buling Mountain.</p><p>Although that ancestor has long since passed away, and the Wen family is not as prosperous as it once was, a connection to Buling Mountain remains.</p><p>When the Wen family called for help, Buling Mountain responded promptly, dispatching an elder immediately.  Fearing a delay in rescue, they urgently sent a message to Pushan Mountain, requesting Qin Sang's assistance.</p><p>Those who dared to infiltrate Zhuo Prefecture and attack the Wen family are audacious to the extreme, reflecting the growing chaos in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered Xie An to guard Pushan Mountain, then flew towards Shuo County at top speed.</p><p>…</p><p>The Wen family controlled a large lake.</p><p>The legacy of their ancestor.</p><p>The Wen family's cultivation grounds, known as Wen Island, boasts exceptional feng shui and stunning scenery, truly a terrestrial fairyland.  The island's protective array was also personally constructed by that ancestor, far surpassing those of ordinary families or sects.</p><p>At present, Wen Island's main island was overrun with sinister presences and filled with screams.</p><p>The island's protective array had been breached.</p><p>Wen Island was a far cry from its former splendor. Most of the buildings were in ruins, the air thick with the stench of blood, the ground littered with corpses – not only cultivators, but also ordinary people.</p><p>Countless people had died horribly; a single intact body was hard to find.  The scene was utterly gruesome.</p><p>In the center of Wen Island, a semi-circular, green protective barrier was faintly visible.</p><p>This was the only area that remained untouched, where the surviving Wen family members huddled together, their only protection a thin shimmering barrier.  Fear and despair were etched on every face; the faint of heart were already weeping.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>…</p><p>The barrier trembled with increasing intensity.</p><p>The sound of raucous laughter echoed from outside, each burst sending shivers down the spines of the Wen family members, who desperately prayed for the Buling Mountain expert to arrive before the barrier shattered.</p><p>A group of figures surrounded the barrier, all clad in black robes and wearing ghost masks—specially crafted artifacts to conceal their identities.</p><p>The attacks on the barrier included blood swords and severed heads, clearly the methods of demonic cultivators.</p><p>While there are numerous demonic sects in Central Plains, with some powerful enough to rival Buling Mountain, they differ from the demonic sects of the Northern Wilderness.  These Northern Wilderness sects are exceptionally brutal and were banished to the Northern Wilderness long ago due to their merciless nature.</p><p>The Wen family fought valiantly.</p><p>The attackers were unable to break through for a long time.</p><p>A figure appearing to be the leader glanced at the sky and lowered his voice, “Retreat!”</p><p>With that, he unhesitatingly sheathed his blood sword and vanished. A few of his companions followed suit, collecting their treasures and escaping.</p><p>The remaining attackers were not happy.</p><p>“We’re about to break the array! The Wen family has a Yuan Ying ancestor; they must have countless treasures! We agreed to share the loot, but you, Wang, are abandoning us!”</p><p>One of them yelled.</p><p>The leader did not turn back, merely sneering,  “While I did desire the Yuan Ying ancestor's treasures, I've changed my mind. You keep what you find; I won't take a single thing, and I'll even offer my congratulations. However, if you all die here, don’t blame me on the road to the Netherworld… make your own choices!”</p><p>His words sparked a torrent of curses.</p><p>They had tricked their way into bypassing Wen Island's main protective array, only to discover an inner spiritual array that had proved impenetrable.</p><p>Having lost their allies, they realized that even if they somehow managed to break the inner array, Buling Mountain’s Yuan Ying cultivator would have arrived by then.  Any treasures they managed to secure would be useless to them.</p><p>Defeated, they had no choice but to withdraw.</p><p>The group flew north, scattering like birds after leaving Wen Island.</p><p>The Wen family, having narrowly escaped, were still shaken and distraught, witnessing the devastation around them.  Some, upon seeing the bodies of their loved ones, wept uncontrollably, wanting to go out, but were stopped by the family head.</p><p>Shortly after,</p><p>A streak of light appeared on the horizon, swift as lightning, arriving above Wen Island in an instant.</p><p>Seeing the unfamiliar figure, the Wen family head's expression changed, swallowing the words on his lips.</p><p>"You are Wen Qi, the head of the Wen family? I am Qingfeng of Pushan Mountain, sent here by Buling Mountain to assist."</p><p>The newcomer was Qin Sang.</p><p>Having rushed here immediately upon receiving the news, he was still too late. He hadn't expected the Wen Island's protective array to be breached so quickly. The island was in ruins, and the attackers had vanished without a trace.</p><p>Fortunately, the Wen family was not completely annihilated, and its foundation remained.</p><p>"Was the senior cultivator Qingfeng Daozhang from Pushan?"</p><p>Wen Qi, upon learning Qin Sang's identity, finally dared to leave the protective formation.  He fell to his knees amidst the corpses, his robes stained crimson with blood, crying out in anguish, "Please, senior cultivator, avenge the Wen family!"</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal, glancing around. "Do you know who attacked Wenjia Island? Which direction did they flee?"</p><p>Wen Qi pointed north, his hatred palpable. "The Wen family has always been cautious and law-abiding, never making enemies. Those were devils from the Northern Wastelands, cruel and ruthless. They must have coveted the ancestral treasures. To seize them, they slaughtered my entire family!"</p><p>Wen Qi's account matched Bu Nianshan's assessment.  The descendants of Yuan Ying cultivators always possessed considerable wealth, enough to tempt unscrupulous individuals.</p><p>However, Qin Sang noticed something amiss after a quick survey. He asked, "Were those devils busy pillaging and slaughtering from the moment they attacked Wenjia Island?"</p><p>Wen Qi hesitated, then nodded. He wasn't a fool; Qin Sang's question sparked an understanding.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. Compared to other factions, the Wen family was wealthy; the attackers could have left laden with spoils. But these were ordinary treasures; they could have gathered similar riches through several raids elsewhere. Why risk entering Zhuozhou and provoking Bu Nianshan?</p><p>Wen Qi insisted they coveted the ancestral treasures, but the island's condition suggested otherwise. It seemed the attackers deliberately left the Wen family a chance to escape, allowing the family head time to activate the protective formation and send for help.</p><p>If reinforcements were the real target, then they were likely aiming for Bu Nianshan!  Qin Sang had employed this tactic countless times. Simple, yet effective.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. The attackers surely hadn't anticipated Bu Nianshan summoning him. His journey was uneventful, but the same might not be true for the elder Bu Nianshan sent.</p><p>"Cheng Weizidaoyou will arrive shortly. Return now; no one should leave the formation."</p><p>Qin Sang left, without pursuing the devils, turning towards the southeast.</p><p>The scenery of Shuogun was as beautiful as that of Zezhou.  Qin Sang paid it no mind, lost in thought. He shared a bond of hardship with Lu Zhang and had a good relationship with Bu Nianshan. If a Bu Nianshan elder was in danger, he should help.  But he didn't know which faction targeted Bu Nianshan or their purpose.</p><p>If the opponent was too strong, he could only wait for an opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his speed, concealing himself, proceeding cautiously.</p><p>After a short while, a streak of light, like a shooting star, appeared on the horizon, heading straight for him. Qin Sang secretly held his spiritual treasure, watching intently.  It was Cheng Weizidaoyou from Bu Nianshan.</p><p>Cheng Weizidaoyou seemed unharmed.</p><p>"Perhaps I was wrong," Qin Sang thought, revealing himself.</p><p>Simultaneously, Cheng Weizidaoyou's voice echoed from the light.</p><p>"Qingfeng Daozhang?"</p><p>The light faded, revealing Cheng Weizidaoyou. "Daozhang came from Wenjia Island? Did you eliminate the devils who attacked?"</p><p>Qin Sang studied Cheng Weizidaoyou, shaking his head. "By the time I arrived, the devils had already fled..."</p><p>He recounted his findings and suspicions, explaining, "I suspected a conspiracy, fearing an ambush on you. I came to meet you, but it seems I overreacted.  Sadly, we've lost valuable time; catching them is unlikely now..."</p><p>As he spoke, Cheng Weizidaoyou's expression changed.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>As if remembering something, Cheng Weizidaoyou abruptly turned, leaving without explanation.</p><p>Qin Sang followed, flying alongside him.</p><p>Cheng Weizidaoyou bowed slightly in gratitude. But he wasn't flying back to Bu Nianshan, but toward a famous mountain range in Zhuozhou – Dachi Mountain.</p><p>Dachi Mountain was known for its vastness, stretching endlessly, second only to Zhaoyao Mountain in the Northern Four Provinces. The spiritual energy was thinner, lacking significant spiritual realms, but it boasted numerous caves, home to many independent cultivators and small sects affiliated with Bu Nianshan.</p><p>After passing dozens of peaks, Cheng Weizidaoyou landed in a hidden valley. Qin Sang followed, finding only ruins.</p><p>Several people lay on the ground, bleeding profusely, lifeless.</p><p>Clearly, a protective formation had concealed the valley. The formation had been recently broken.</p><p>Qin Sang also saw traces of a battle between Yuan Ying cultivators.  Both combatants were gone, leaving the outcome and the stolen object unknown.</p><p>Cheng Weizidaoyou's face was filled with bitterness. "To be frank, Daozhang, there was a Heavenly Spirit Tree here, a rare Red Jujube tree. Eating one red jujube every thirty years greatly benefits Yuan Ying cultivators."</p><p>The Red Date Spirit Tree, the treasure of the Changfeng Sect, ripens periodically.  We always exchange a portion with the Changfeng Sect…”</p><p>Cheng Weizhi dashed into the depths of the valley, locating a clear spring.  Beside the spring was a large pit; the Spirit Tree had been uprooted.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around and asked, “Is the Changfeng Sect leader also a Yuan Ying cultivator?”</p><p>Cheng Weizhi nodded. “Of similar cultivation to myself.  Our sect has several training grounds in Da Chi Mountain, often used by elders. Currently, only my senior brother Cheng Shenzi and I remain.”</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed.  Their elaborate plan was for the Changfeng Sect’s Spirit Tree. Attacking Wenjia Island was a diversion to lure Cheng Weizhi away.</p><p>The loss of the Spirit Tree was a fait accompli; the Sect leader's fate remained unknown.</p><p>Hesitation was impossible.</p><p>Cheng Weizhi sent a message to their sect before following the trail.</p><p>“Daoist Cheng Shenzi isn’t at his cultivation cave?” Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>Cheng Shenzi’s strength supposedly surpassed Lu Zhang, making him the second strongest in Bu Nian Mountain, only surpassed by the Sect Leader. However, past injuries had hampered his potential, leaving his cultivation stagnant for years.</p><p>With Cheng Shenzi guarding Da Chi Mountain, this theft should have been impossible.</p><p>With matters as they were, Cheng Weizhi no longer concealed anything.  “Daoist, you likely haven’t received the news.  Recently, a message arrived from the East Sea; someone sighted strange phenomena near the Chi Nan Islands, possibly the emergence of the Wu Wang Temple ruins. That's not all;  many Yuan Ying cultivators from Ba Guanguan and Ganlu Chan Yuan were also seen nearby. The Sect Leader and my senior brother went to the East Sea, and this happened right after they left.”</p><p>Chi Nan Islands!</p><p>Wu Wang Temple!</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't forgotten the upheaval of thirty years ago.  He had witnessed it, but withdrew early and didn't learn the full story. He never expected the storm to brew for so long before erupting.</p><p>“Are you certain it's the Wu Wang Temple?” Qin Sang urgently asked.</p><p>Cheng Weizhi shook his head, distractedly replying, “The target has reportedly been identified; news should arrive soon.”</p><p>Doubt flickered in his eyes.  “The Sect Leader and senior brother only left for the East Sea three days ago, secretly at that.  How did these demons know?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly; unspoken words lingered.</p><p>Only two possibilities existed.</p><p>Either the demons had prior knowledge, closely watching Cheng Shenzi's cultivation cave, seizing their opportunity the moment he left Da Chi Mountain.</p><p>Or…  Bu Nian Mountain had an internal problem.</p><p>Cheng Weizhi clearly thought so too, his face darkening.</p><p>As they spoke, the two pursued the trail beyond Da Chi Mountain.</p><p>The trail grew fainter.</p><p>After an unknown distance, they finally found the Changfeng Sect Leader.</p><p>The Sect Leader sat atop a mountain peak, his robes wrinkled, his figure desolate.  Seeing Cheng Weizhi arrive, he only offered a wry smile.</p><p>After their exchange, they learned only one person had stolen the Spirit Tree.</p><p>“Did you recognize him?”</p><p>Cheng Weizhi said gravely, noting that Bu Nian Mountain hadn’t suffered such a significant loss since Lu Zhang’s injury.</p><p>The Changfeng Sect Leader hesitated. “Though this demon concealed himself, resisting my Hunfeng Thrust revealed clues. However, I’ve only seen this in ancient texts. I’m unsure if I’m correct… it resembled the legendary Zhu Long Demon Qi!”</p><p>“Lu Lao Mo's Zhu Long Demon Qi?”</p><p>Cheng Weizhi gasped.</p><p>Qin Sang’s pupils constricted. He didn't know about the Zhu Long Demon Qi, but recognized that Cheng Weizhi referred to Lu Lao Mo, a current Nascent Soul cultivator among the demons.</p><p>This demon's domain, Luye, was located in the Northern Wasteland, but his title ‘Luye’ derived from his domain name.</p><p>No one knew Lu Lao Mo's real name.</p><p>He was extremely mysterious, disappearing even earlier than Dan Yu Zhenjun and Hui Guang Shengzhe, vanishing centuries ago, sealing Luye and retreating from the world.</p><p>Over the years, many claimed to be Lu Lao Mo’s successors, but all were proven false.</p><p>Rumors circulated about Lu Lao Mo’s ascension, or that the Buddha and Dao sects had destroyed him.</p><p>“Is Luye also emerging?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>The Wu Wang Temple ruins, Ba Guanguan and Ganlu Chan Yuan’s awakening, the Gu Shen Cult lurking in the Southern Barbarians’ two states, and the possible emergence of Luye in the Northern Wasteland—the world’s fate was increasingly unclear.</p><p>After conferring with the Changfeng Sect Leader, Cheng Weizhi decided to continue searching, hoping to discover clues.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt something, a deep joy crossing his eyes. He hastily took leave of the two and hurried back to Pusan.</p>
