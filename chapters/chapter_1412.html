<h1></h1><p>Qi and Wang had nothing to do, retreating to the side to stand guard.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed close to the altar, using his divine sense to soothe the Fire Jade Centipede, while observing Valley Master Mu's actions.</p><p>Valley Master Mu sat cross-legged atop the altar, raised both hands, and formed an ancient hand seal, remaining motionless.</p><p>At the same time, his lips moved slightly, uttering a series of unintelligible syllables.</p><p>As the secret art progressed.</p><p>The altar emanated a cyan light from within.</p><p>The cyan light did not dissipate outwards, but instead gathered on the surface of the altar, surging upwards like flowing water.</p><p>Gradually, Valley Master Mu and the three spirit insects were all bathed in the cyan light, their figures almost indiscernible to the naked eye.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede instinctively felt uneasy, its legs on both sides gently swaying.</p><p>Just then, the altar shook violently.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The cyan light suddenly contracted, condensing into a nearly ring-shaped pattern above the altar, filled with dense and bizarre runes.</p><p>The three spirit insects happened to be located at the three vertices, enveloped in cocoons formed of cyan light, and then involuntarily began to rotate along with the pattern.</p><p>Not only the Fire Jade Centipede, but the other two spirit insects also began to feel uneasy.</p><p>Receiving reassurance from their master, they quickly calmed down, and the Insect Formation was successfully deployed!</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>Valley Master Mu spoke with a voice like thunder in spring, uttering a bizarre incantation.</p><p>The Horseshoe Crab and Black Demon Ant were the first to show anomalies, the power within their bodies extracted by the Insect Formation, and slowly poured into the Fire Jade Centipede's body along with the changes in the formation's momentum.</p><p>In an instant, the Fire Jade Centipede's body tensed into a straight line.</p><p>Its legs on both sides tightly contracted.</p><p>Flames erupted from within its body, violently swaying.</p><p>This was just the beginning.</p><p>As the Insect Formation continued.</p><p>The Black Demon Ant began to become somewhat listless, and the Horseshoe Crab's aura was also weakening.</p><p>In contrast, the Fire Jade Centipede's aura was growing stronger and stronger.</p><p>Although it was a rare insect, its potential far exceeded other spirit insects, but its cultivation level was lower than the other two, and even a major realm below the Horseshoe Crab, soon exceeding its own tolerance limit.</p><p>External power was forcibly poured into its body.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede curled up tightly into a ball, trembling in pain.</p><p>Qin Sang tensely monitored the Fire Jade Centipede's changes, ready to stop Valley Master Mu's arbitrary actions at any time, so as not to cause irreversible damage, or even allow the Fire Jade Centipede to follow in the footsteps of the Jade Swallowing Bees.</p><p>As long as the injuries it suffered did not exceed the limit, he would have plenty of time to help it recover later.</p><p>Qi and Wang, who were observing from the periphery, also showed nervous expressions.</p><p>Valley Master Mu's control over the Insect Formation was wonderfully precise.</p><p>The power in the Insect Formation was very gentle, minimizing the damage to the Fire Jade Centipede as much as possible.</p><p>As time passed.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's aura grew stronger and stronger, and it was about to surpass the Black Demon Ant.</p><p>"Enough!"</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the Fire Jade Centipede, and suddenly shouted to stop.</p><p>Valley Master Mu's eyelids twitched, and he complied readily, immediately stopping and opening his eyes, taking a glance at the Fire Jade Centipede, and gently nodding, "It was just a little short of the limit, but this is enough, infinitely close to the Fourth Transformation. If this still doesn't work, even continuing to pour in power would be useless… Let's try it!"</p><p>Qin Sang urged his divine sense.</p><p>Under the intense pain, the Fire Jade Centipede's pitiful consciousness had become very chaotic, and Qin Sang spent a great deal of effort to barely perceive its consciousness, trying his best to soothe it.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's curled-up body gradually unfolded.</p><p>The four people stared intently at the Fire Jade Centipede, secretly anticipating.</p><p>After a few breaths.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's upper body suddenly swayed slightly, faintly probing forward, the movement was very small, but it could not escape the eyes of the Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Valley Master Mu's pupils shrank, and he hurriedly looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>But he saw Qin Sang's face full of solemnity, and after a moment, he suddenly shifted his gaze from the Fire Jade Centipede to the formation beside him, and pointed with his hand, "There!"</p><p>Everyone was ecstatic.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had actually sensed the entrance to the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang was not sure whether it was the effect of the Myriad Spirit Fruit, but he was certain that there were treasures inside that attracted the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Just now, the consciousness transmitted by the Fire Jade Centipede was very short, but the pointing was very clear.</p><p>It was not in the exact center of the formation, but in the position slightly to the right of the center.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi had already made preparations, and upon hearing this, he did not hesitate, his figure swaying, he immediately rushed towards the position Qin Sang pointed to. Unexpectedly, before he could approach, the old scene reappeared, and he was shifted to the other side by the formation.</p><p>They had expected this, and were not discouraged.</p><p>Qi and Wang each displayed their skills, trying one after another, but all failed, and could not help but frown.</p><p>They offered their respective magical artifacts, attacking the location of the entrance with all their strength, like a stone sinking into the sea.</p><p>The formation did not shift the attack away, but it also did not react to it.</p><p>Valley Master Mu maintained the Insect Formation, distracted to observe for a while, and said, "Now it seems that it is impossible to approach the entrance in the formation, we can only attack it forcefully! Without anomalies, it is likely that the power to break the formation is not strong enough."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, he was interrupted by Qin Sang, "The position has changed! Over there!"</p><p>Hearing this, the three people's expressions changed drastically.</p><p>"The Pure Sea Sect entrance can actually move within the formation, no wonder we have tried so many times without any progress. And ordinary attacks are of no use, we must all attack together, focusing our attacks on one point!"</p><p>The female cultivator surnamed Wang said in a deep voice.</p><p>Valley Master Mu nodded, "Set up the formation!"</p><p>Qi and Wang returned to the altar.</p><p>They were very tacit, lightly patting their mustard seed bags, and blue flag banners flew out like flowing water.</p><p>The two people's figures changed for a while, and they quickly attacked.</p><p>Before long, a complex flag formation took shape around them, the two people stood in the formation, forming seals to activate the flag formation.</p><p>The flag formation was located underwater, unaffected, the flag surfaces swaying.</p><p>Pure water essence power continuously gathered towards the center of the flag formation.</p><p>The two Nascent Souls fully activated the formation, and only saw the seawater churning, a ball of ice-like transparent water gradually forming, after a dazzling change, condensing into a seven-foot-long transparent water sword!</p><p>The water sword pointed remotely at the formation, poised to strike.</p><p>At the same time, Valley Master Mu also took out a serpent spear.</p><p>The top of the serpent spear was flashing with blue light, extremely sharp, initially only the length of an arm, Valley Master Mu flicked his finger, the serpent spear flew up, its size soaring, the spear tip also pointing directly at the formation.</p><p>"Daoist Priest?"</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi called out.</p><p>The three people looked at Qin Sang one after another.</p><p>During this time, the position of the entrance had changed several times again.</p><p>According to the pattern摸索  based on the Fire Jade Centipede's feedback, it changed about every three breaths, but the position of the change was completely random.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, his mind moved, and the Gold Submergence Sword jumped out of the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>"There!"</p><p>With Qin Sang's order, the four Nascent Souls attacked with all their strength.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Water sword, serpent spear, Gold Submergence Sword.</p><p>The three incomparably powerful attacks, at the same instant, fiercely pierced the same point!</p><p>Previously, Qi and Wang's attacks would only pass through.</p><p>This time, what came was a deafening roar!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Time seemed to freeze, the three attacks stagnated in place.</p><p>At the same time, within the formation, a point of scarlet light, like ink in water, spread out at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>
