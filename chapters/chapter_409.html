<h1>Chapter 402: The Lair</h1><p>Chapter 402: The Lair</p><p>The origins and bloodlines of demonic beasts are quite complex.</p><p>Not every demonic beast can transform into a human form during the Transformation Stage. However, among those of the same cultivation level, those unable to transform into humans are not necessarily weaker than those who can.</p><p>Whether the Thunder Hawk can transform into a human is unknown.  Even if it could, facing two Yuan Ying cultivators, it's not surprising that it would revert to its true form to fight.</p><p>Fighting two at once and holding its own, the Thunder Hawk is the strongest demonic beast Qin Sang has ever seen.</p><p>This battle was also his first time witnessing a fight between Yuan Ying powerhouses firsthand. The scene of the two black-robed men breaking the ancient seal was insignificant compared to this.</p><p>The bluish-white wind sea churned unpredictably.</p><p>The wind and clouds changed, and the heavens seemed enraged.</p><p>Three figures appeared and disappeared within the wind sea. Qin Sang couldn't clearly see how they were fighting; he could only catch glimpses of their movements when the fierce wind subsided, revealing their forms.</p><p>The black-robed man controlled a Xuan Turtle shell. The shell, like a shield, manifested a huge Xuan Turtle phantom, slightly smaller than the Thunder Hawk.  It let out a mournful roar, prostrate in the sky, its head raised in anger, glaring at the Thunder Hawk.</p><p>With a casual strike, the Wuji Sect Master unleashed a thousand-zhang-long sword energy that easily pierced the wind sea, leaving a chasm that lingered for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang was both amazed and captivated.</p><p>The Thunder Hawk was in no way inferior to the two Yuan Ying cultivators; it even seemed to have the upper hand. Its cry was sharp, filled with warning and fury.  Each breath released a column of lightning, and the flapping of its wings summoned a thunderstorm.</p><p>The raging lightning, radiating a destructive aura, sent chills down Qin Sang's spine even from afar.</p><p>Each attack from the Yuan Ying powerhouses harnessed the power of heaven and earth, exceeding imagination in its power. Even though the battlefield was far away, the aftershocks caused the ice plains to tremble.</p><p>The previous tremors in the ice cave were caused by the impact of their battle.</p><p>Qin Sang had no doubt that if the battlefield were near the ice cave, it would have been shattered to pieces.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang noticed something.</p><p>The Wuji Sect Master and the mysterious black-robed man didn't seem to be trying to kill the Thunder Hawk.</p><p>They cooperated seamlessly, with clear roles, as if they had another objective. They were constantly attempting to break through the Thunder Hawk's blockade. One would engage the Thunder Hawk while the other tried to bypass it, but each time they were driven back, unable to succeed.</p><p>The Thunder Hawk, possessing such formidable strength, clearly possessed great intelligence.  After discerning the intentions of the Wuji Sect Master and the other, it didn't attack actively. It would repel them and then retreat, firmly guarding its position, leaving them no opportunity.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang could also guess.</p><p>The Thunder Hawk's strength might not surpass the two of them combined, but its rage was boundless, driving it to fight recklessly.  However, the Wuji Sect Master and his companion valued their lives and were unwilling to risk a mutually destructive outcome.</p><p>Because of this, the Wuji Sect Master and the other acted cautiously, making the Thunder Hawk appear to have the upper hand.</p><p>What were the Wuji Sect Master and the other looking for?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled a scene he had witnessed earlier: after the two broke the ancient seal, one went down to search but seemed to have not found what he sought before leaving.</p><p>What could be so important that it would make two Yuan Ying cultivators venture into the boundless valley, risking a fierce battle with a Thunder Hawk? A divine herb, or an ancient treasure?</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, emerged from behind the ice, and stood at the edge of the ice cave, observing his surroundings.</p><p>Due to the Xuan Frost Gale, the spiritual energy in this area was exceptionally chaotic. As long as Qin Sang remained hidden, even Yuan Ying cultivators would find it difficult to detect his presence.</p><p>The ice cave he was in seemed to be located on an iceberg.  The entire mountain was riddled with countless similar ice caves, resembling a gigantic honeycomb, forming a strangely unique landscape.</p><p>The wind and snow poured in, producing a mournful whistling sound.</p><p>At the foot of the iceberg, there was a bottomless deep cave, incredibly vast.</p><p>The wind sea in the sky pressed down low, forming a giant funnel connecting to the deep cave.  At the center of the deep cave was a striking white pillar of wind, condensed Xuan Frost Gale, like a dragon emerging from the water.</p><p>It was as if the gale descended from the heavens.</p><p>After observation, however, Qin Sang discovered that the deep cave was actually the source of the Xuan Frost Gale.</p><p>Endless gale poured forth from the deep cave, gathering in the high sky.</p><p>After accumulating for countless millennia, as far as the eye could see, there was nothing but boundless Xuan Frost Gale, monotonous in its endless expanse of bluish-white.</p><p>Could the Thunder Hawk's lair be inside the deep cave?</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, now understanding.</p><p>The Nightfall Lily's growth site is dangerously close to the Thunder Hawk's nest.  Without the protective array, once the Nightfall Lily matures, its alluring aura would be impossible to conceal, even amidst the chaotic spiritual energy.  It would likely become the Thunder Hawk's prey instantly.</p><p>No wonder the cultivator who first discovered the Nightfall Lily was so cautious, using a teleportation array, taking great pains, and prioritizing concealment in every restriction. The array protecting the Nightfall Lily is exceptionally well-hidden, effectively sealing its aura.  Any extra effort would risk attracting the Thunder Hawk.</p><p>The two leaders of the Wujimen seem focused on the deep cave.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted between the deep cave and the sky. His fists clenched, his expression shifting, his heart torn between hesitation and struggle.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the battlefield, two cultivators and the beast were locked in a stalemate.  Qin Sang couldn't gauge the true strength of the Yuan Ying cultivators, but it was clear that a decisive victory was unlikely in the short term.  This didn't, however, leave him any opportunity to act.</p><p>The deep cave is the source of the Xuan Frost Gale; it's undoubtedly extremely dangerous.  While the gale seems concentrated in the cave's center, the entire cave is affected by its terrifyingly frigid winds. Though Qin Sang isn't vulnerable to the gale's spiritual energy erosion, his physical body is fragile. Whether his Red Pill would be effective so close to the gale is uncertain.</p><p>Even more daunting are the three Yuan Ying-level masters in the air.</p><p>The situation is volatile. Whether the Wujimen leaders seize an opportunity, break through the Thunder Hawk's blockade and enter the cave, or whether they retreat, and the Thunder Hawk returns to its nest, Qin Sang will be in grave danger.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, but the choice wasn't agonizingly difficult.  The two Yuan Ying cultivators seemed reluctant to engage in prolonged combat and might withdraw at any moment. Their attitude prevented Qin Sang from acting rashly.</p><p>This was a potentially fatal opportunity, with less than a fifty percent chance of success. The reward was unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly decided to stay put in the ice cave, observing the Yuan Ying cultivators' battle as a valuable learning experience.</p><p>However, just as Qin Sang made his decision, the situation changed again.</p>
