<h1>Chapter 1631: Sword Cultivation Technique</h1><p>Initially, Qin Sang, having condensed a Yuanmo fetus avatar, sent it to the Lan Dou Sect to gather intelligence.  By chance, the avatar was accepted by the Yin-Yang lineage of the Lan Dou Sect and learned the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique."</p><p>The Lan Dou Sect's original inheritance only encompassed the first layer. A remarkably talented senior Yin-Yang Daoist later completed the cultivation technique, passing it down through their lineage.</p><p>This technique, from the very beginning of cultivation, condenses Yin-Yang armor and cultivates Yin-Yang energy, making it exceptionally extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang was quite interested, even considering it as a backup technique to the "Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter." However, upon discovering the technique's incompleteness and the difficulty of obtaining its true essence, he abandoned the idea.</p><p>Nevertheless, he had already mastered the first layer of the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique," condensing a set of Yin-Yang armor to conceal the Buddha's light emanating from the jade Buddha within his Yuanshen.</p><p>For many years, the Yin-Yang armor proved ineffective.  Qin Sang lacked the time to delve deeper into the technique and thus set it aside, almost forgetting about it entirely.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a premonition arises; the treasure within the jade cage seems connected to this technique!</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised, his gaze fixed on the glowing orb.</p><p>The jade cage, carved from spirit jade, prevents the Heavenly Eye from seeing the treasure inside.  Investigating with spiritual sense into the Cloud Pool would trigger a counterattack. To learn what treasure is sealed within, he must devise a method to lure out the jade cage.</p><p>He didn't spend too long in the lower level of the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>Time wasn't pressing.</p><p>He was also curious about the treasure linked to the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique." Although he had only cultivated the first layer, Qin Sang believed this technique was undoubtedly significant, a great inheritance!</p><p>Turning, he stared at the floating jade cage, circling the surrounding corridors to maintain proximity.</p><p>Simultaneously, guided by Qin Sang, the Heavenly Eye butterfly pushed its Heavenly Eye power to its limit, carefully investigating and considering the safest method to retrieve the treasure.</p><p>When the Wuxiang Immortal Sect faced its destruction, the Immortal Pavilion remained undamaged.  Even using the Sun God Tree, he couldn't destroy the Cloud Pool; forceful seizure was clearly infeasible.</p><p>A single misstep could cause the Cloud Pool to change, creating even more trouble.</p><p>“Each treasure in the pool is connected to the Cloud Pool's energy, forming a seamless whole; affecting one affects all. To retrieve treasures from the pool, one must be clever. Human abilities have limits; it's difficult for one person alone. If I summon my avatar or get a few more helpers, it will be much easier…”</p><p>The enemies of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, while likely skilled in formations and restrictions, might not have surpassed him. It’s likely they used multiple people to retrieve the treasures, yet they couldn't empty the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped focusing on the cage, overlooking the entire Cloud Pool, silently strategizing.</p><p>Soon, a stream of light flew from his dantian.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye butterfly flew outside, gently flapping its wings around the Cloud Pool, while Qin Sang remained motionless, his eyes flashing with strange lights, the Immortal Pavilion returning to silence.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft breath, pondering for a moment before a fire lotus appeared on his brow.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang summoned the demonic fire from the demonic banner, guided by the fire lotus, forming a sea of fire above his head.</p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, the sea of fire divided into four, the flames converging toward the centers of the four fire masses, gradually transforming into four fire figures. These fire figures lacked features and sentience, merely simple imitations, yet each contained a trace of Qin Sang's essence, while he sealed his own.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The four fire figures flew toward the four corners of the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the middle of a corridor, overseeing the entire operation.</p><p>The Immortal Pavilion fell silent once more.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly watched the jade cage darting around in the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Finally, the jade cage drifted near the center of the Cloud Pool. Qin Sang's expression changed as he pressed his hand against the Cloud Pool, the pre-prepared hand seal flying out.</p><p>Simultaneously, as if receiving a command, the four fire figures raised their arms in unison, pointing at the jade cage. Eight fire serpents, one after another, shot out from their bodies.</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh whoosh…’</p><p>The fire serpents shot into the Cloud Pool, immediately provoking a violent counterattack.</p><p>Thunderous sounds erupted, with cloud thunder bursting from the four corners of the Cloud Pool.  The fire serpents didn't flinch, colliding head-on with the cloud thunder.</p><p>Amidst the ‘boom,’ the fire serpents were no match for the cloud thunder and began to crumble.</p><p>However, the fire serpents acted in pairs. While the leading serpent resisted the cloud thunder, the following serpent seized the opportunity to pierce through the thunder blockade and contact the cloud mist within the Cloud Pool.</p><p>The cloud mist wasn't real but a manifestation of the Cloud Pool's restrictions.</p><p>The demonic fire clashed directly with the Cloud Pool's restrictions.</p><p>This was the crucial moment.  As the restriction launched its counterattack, the treasure in the pool became translucent, about to disappear as before.</p><p>He had to retrieve the jade cage before the treasure vanished.</p><p>The Sky Eye butterfly hovered in mid-air, taking in the scene within the Cloud Pool and transmitting the images to Qin Sang's mind. He had to divide his attention four ways, controlling four fire figures to respond to changes from all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on analyzing the shifting restrictions, even his cultivation level found it very taxing.  His brow furrowed, he held his breath, not daring to be distracted.</p><p>The fire figures misled the Cloud Pool's restrictions.</p><p>The Cloud Pool's restrictions treated the fire figures as enemies, unleashing furious thunderclouds towards the four corners.  Undeterred by death, the fire figures not only held their ground but fiercely counterattacked.</p><p>Inside the Cloud Pool, the confrontation with the restrictions also progressed.</p><p>Within the clouds, four fire serpents multiplied and, at some point, connected, forming a hollow net of fire, rapidly contracting inward.</p><p>This couldn't prevent the treasure's disappearance from the Cloud Pool, but it did restrain the Cloud Pool's restrictions, slowing the jade cage's vanishing speed.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang was no longer using his mind in four ways at once; he devoted another part of his mind to locking onto the jade cage, analyzing the changes in the restrictions around it against the clock!</p><p>At that moment, he finally made his move!</p><p>A clear ring of his sword echoed, the spirit sword striking again!</p><p>The sword light was like a rainbow, piercing straight towards the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang withdrew his spirit to his purple mansion, his body swaying. The surrounding light flickered uncertainly. He summoned the Yin-Yang Armor from his purple mansion.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Yin-Yang Armor reverted to its essence of Yin and Yang energy, transforming into a large Yin-Yang hand, following the path left by the sword light to seize the jade cage.</p><p>All obstacles were shattered by the Jinchen Sword, but this also caused the jade cage to disappear rapidly.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>The jade cage shook, an inexplicable resistance emerging from within, preventing it from hiding in time. It hesitated for only a moment before being grasped by the Yin-Yang hand!</p><p>Qin Sang's face brightened; the Yin-Yang Armor had indeed triggered a reaction from the treasure inside the cage.</p><p>The Cloud Pool's restrictions counterattacked wildly, but it was too late.</p><p>The Yin-Yang hand immediately retreated.</p><p>The Jinchen Sword and demonic fire provided escort, turning the Cloud Pool upside down, successfully bringing the jade cage back!</p><p>Having obtained the treasure, Qin Sang immediately retreated to the lower level, waiting for the Cloud Pool's restrictions to subside before ascending the celestial pavilion again.</p><p>The jade cage was now in his possession.</p><p>As expected, the jade cage's function was simple: to isolate and seal the treasure's energy fluctuations. The other broken swords and blades had lost their power, so the jade cage was unnecessary.</p><p>After some investigation, Qin Sang devised a way to open it. He sent his spiritual sense into the jade cage, and with a 'click', it cracked open, and a mass of grayish-white light tumbled out.</p><p>Inside the grayish-white light was a piece of crude jade!</p><p>The crude jade was oval-shaped, rough on the surface, speckled with spots, as if a layer of stone skin hadn't been scraped clean, lacking any smoothness.</p><p>Layers of grayish-white light constantly emanated from within the crude jade.</p><p>The light spread outwards, gradually fading and disappearing.</p><p>When illuminated by the light, Qin Sang felt no discomfort, sensing a familiar energy fluctuation, originating from the same source as the Yin-Yang Armor, certainly greatly related.</p><p>He refined Yin-Yang energy again, activating the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique." When he got close, the jade's light brightened significantly, and the fluctuations intensified, but that was all.</p><p>When he withdrew his Yin-Yang energy, the jade returned to normal.</p><p>Several attempts yielded the same result.</p><p>Even using the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique" to activate the jade failed to unleash new power.</p><p>"This… could it be because my cultivation in this technique is too low?"</p><p>Qin Sang knew the technique was incomplete, so he abandoned it, and later did not attempt to steal the technique mastered by the Yin-Yang Daoist.</p><p>"This object aligns with the Yin-Yang Dao, but has no other miraculous properties. The Wuxiang Immortal Sect keeping it in the Cloud Pool suggests its origin is not simple, likely from the Immortal Palace."</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>Fragments of the technique ended up in the Canglang Sea, but the treasure related to it appeared in Central State, likely due to the connection between the Immortal Palaces in both locations.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't know where the Canglang Sea was; otherwise, he could visit and ask for help. The Lan Dou Sect might be able to offer some insight.</p><p>Unable to determine its nature for now, Qin Sang stored the crude jade in his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>"Canglang Sea… Tian Tong and Tian Xiang should have ascended to Heaven with the Ziwei Palace. Seven Kills Hall is gone, right?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought of this out of the blue.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace's ascension actually hinted at another path to ascension.</p><p>The ancient teleportation array in the Immortal Palace possessed power beyond ordinary understanding, possibly able to break through the boundary between worlds.</p><p>If Seven Kills Hall remained, one could use the ancient teleportation array in the Seven Kills Hall's Immortal Palace to teleport to the Ziwei Palace and thus leave this realm!</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt the chances were slim, less feasible than the Ascension Platform or the East Sea Abyss.</p><p>With Tian Tong Hall and Tian Xiang Hall ascended, hope for that path was practically nonexistent.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, dismissing distracting thoughts.  He ascended the jade steps, reaching the summit of the Láng Zhong.</p><p>This level was simpler than the one below.</p><p>Four pillars supported the jade pavilion's roof.  There was no other furnishing; only a meditation cushion sat on the smooth floor.</p><p>The cushion wasn't made of any rare materials.</p><p>The only noteworthy feature was the pavilion's dome. The lower passage resembled a starry sky, but here, a real starry sky was depicted, its starlight shimmering.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, then walked towards the cushion. After examining it for a moment, he sat cross-legged.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The instant he sat, the starlight on the dome intensified, converging into a pillar of light that poured down upon him.</p><p>Qin Sang felt no threat and remained seated.</p><p>The Tianmu butterfly on his shoulder took flight, circling him and guarding against any approach to the pavilion.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang felt as if he'd fallen into a sea of stars.</p><p>Actually, a wisp of his consciousness had been drawn into an unknown space, where luminous orbs floated. Some orbs shone brightly, while most were dim.</p><p>There weren't actually that many orbs, but they swirled around his consciousness, creating an illusion of abundance.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively moved toward one of the brighter orbs.</p><p>As soon as his consciousness made contact, a surge of information flowed into his mind.</p><p>The *Incomplete Scroll of the Nameless Dan Formula*!</p><p>It was a fragment of an alchemic text. The inheritance from the Water Phase Hall had left his consciousness reeling, but this scroll was a true scripture. He could understand the ancient characters, but their combined meaning eluded him.</p><p>Moreover, the scroll's content was disjointed, and memorizing it would require considerable mental effort.</p><p>"The bright orbs all contain stored fragments of various classics!"</p><p>Qin Sang was not worried but rather delighted; he'd finally found the right place.  The Láng Zhong was a treasure trove; the lower level held unidentified ancient artifacts, while the upper level held scriptures.</p><p>This was where the high-cultivators of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect cultivated their understanding. Although fragments, they all had significant origins.  Comprehending even a small part could benefit one for a lifetime.</p><p>"Is the *Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen* here?"</p><p>Qin Sang rarely felt nervous, but this was different. The Láng Zhong was his only remaining hope. Obtaining this cultivation technique would significantly impact his future path.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang withdrew his consciousness from the alchemic formula and began touching the other orbs, searching tirelessly.</p><p>*Incomplete Scroll of the Heavenly Attraction*.</p><p>*Nameless Cultivation Technique*.</p><p>*Method for Refining the Spirit Treasure Sky-Binding Seal (Incomplete)*.</p><p>…</p><p>Orb after orb flashed by, a whirlwind of information. Most were labeled "Nameless" or "Incomplete Scroll," confirming Qin Sang's suspicions.</p><p>In fact, only a select few incomplete scriptures deserved a place in the Láng Zhong; many orbs contained nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned most of them, but he didn't find what he was looking for, and his mind tightened with anxiety.</p><p>He scanned another orb.</p><p>"An incomplete divine ability, not a cultivation technique!"</p><p>Qin Sang saw the name, disappointment etched on his face. He skipped the content and touched the next orb.  When he saw the name within, he subconsciously held his breath.</p><p>*Nameless Sword Cultivation Technique*!</p><p>Sword cultivation!  The *Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen*!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He delved into the orb, read the contents, and his tense mind instantly relaxed.</p><p>It was the *Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen*!</p><p>After years of searching, it was finally in his hands, and so easily! It felt unreal; he hoped it was at least the Nascent Soul stage portion.</p><p>Composing himself, Qin Sang continued to peruse the cultivation technique's contents.</p><p>He skimmed it.</p><p>"Eleventh layer! Good!"</p><p>"Twelfth layer…"</p><p>"Finished?"</p><p>Qin Sang froze, then carefully reviewed the contents. He'd been mistaken.</p><p>The first ten layers of the *Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen* formed the foundation of the entire technique. Starting from the Foundation Establishment stage, each minor realm corresponded to a layer.</p><p>The technique was originally split into two parts, each with five layers.</p><p>After the Nascent Soul stage, the pattern changed. The eleventh layer corresponded to the entire Nascent Soul stage, and the twelfth, astonishingly, to the Void Refinement stage!</p><p>This was, at the very least, a cultivation technique directly leading to the Void Refinement Dao!</p><p>When the Wuxiang Immortal Sect obtained the technique, they lacked the pre-Nascent Soul portion, making comprehension extremely difficult.  Moreover, the technique was clearly unorthodox, using the Yuan Shen to cultivate swords, so no one dared to attempt it.</p><p>However, because these two sections involved such high levels, they were placed in the Láng Zhong, in the most important, rearmost positions.</p><p>Having obtained the technique, Qin Sang didn't rush to comprehend it; his current cultivation was insufficient. He continued browsing the other orbs, hoping to find higher levels of the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Technique*.</p><p>Unfortunately, by the end, while he found another fragment leading to the Void Refinement realm, the technique he sought remained elusive.</p>
