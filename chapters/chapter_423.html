<h1>Chapter 416: Blood Essence</h1><p>“Blood Essence!”</p><p>The auction neared its end.</p><p>Mr. Kan held aloft a crimson, orb-like object resembling a demonic beast's heart.  It looked remarkably soft, pulsating like a living heart, swaying gently with Mr. Kan's hand, exuding a sickeningly viscous aura.</p><p>Yet, upon hearing its name, many eyes lit up with avarice. Murmurs rippled through the hall.</p><p>“It’s really Blood Essence!”</p><p>“Mr. Kan announced it himself; it must be true!  And there are even better treasures to come!”</p><p>“I heard Blood Essence is a miraculous healing elixir…”</p><p>…</p><p>Mr. Kan allowed the excited chatter to continue, a smile playing on his lips. After a moment, he announced, “Blood Essence, the quintessence of the Dragon Blood Tree.  Ten thousand Dragon Blood Trees might yield only one Blood Essence, born within the heartwood.  It’s a true wonder of the world! This elixir is a supreme healing remedy; its effects are immediate upon refinement. I hardly need elaborate further…”</p><p>His voice faltered slightly.  He'd noticed the mysterious late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator in the corner finally stir. The figure sat bolt upright; a pair of eyes seemed to pierce the darkness of his robe, fixated on the Blood Essence!</p><p>Since the auction began, dozens of treasures had been sold, yet this individual had remained listless, unmoved. Mr. Kan had almost given up, but a surprising turn of events had unfolded.</p><p>Was this person injured?</p><p>Drawn in by the Blood Essence?</p><p>Mr. Kan pondered, recalling his own collection of healing elixirs.  Whether or not to offer one to this individual required careful consideration.</p><p>“Starting bid: one thousand low-grade spirit stones!  Each subsequent bid must be at least one hundred low-grade spirit stones!”</p><p>Mr. Kan's voice had barely faded when a gravelly, abrupt voice boomed:</p><p>“Four thousand!”</p><p>The would-be bidders froze, turning to gaze at the corner of the hall.</p><p>The figure in dark robes remained seated, unmoved by the weight of countless eyes upon him, displaying remarkable composure.</p><p>Was this a bluff, or was he truly determined to acquire the Blood Essence? His first bid was three times the starting price.</p><p>Mr. Kan's eyes flickered in surprise. This person's sudden emergence was unexpected. He appeared dead-set on obtaining the Blood Essence.</p><p>The previously heated atmosphere plummeted to freezing point. Mr. Kan was about to subtly steer the bidding when another voice cut through the silence:</p><p>“Six thousand low-grade spirit stones.”</p><p>This voice was refined and gentle, a stark contrast to the previous bidder, yet equally impactful.</p><p>Another one!</p><p>A two-thousand increase!</p><p>All eyes swiveled, searching the hall. The source was a man in silver robes, his head concealed by a hood, his face unseen.</p><p>Mr. Kan was taken aback.  He’d assessed the hall's attendees, and the man in silver had been unremarkable, bidding only on low-value items.  This audacious bid was unexpected.</p><p>Mr. Kan realized he had misjudged this person, yet he was secretly pleased.  The auction thrived on such competition.</p><p>A fierce rivalry between these two would be highly beneficial!</p><p>Mr. Kan’s hopes were quickly realized.</p><p>The robed figure in the corner turned to the man in silver, pausing slightly before stating, “Seven thousand!”</p><p>“Eight thousand!”</p><p>The man in silver leaned back, unfazed, his calm tone hinting at an equally composed demeanor beneath the hood.</p><p>“Nine thousand!”</p><p>“Ten thousand!”</p><p>…</p><p>The hall fell silent. Even those in the private boxes above simply watched the spectacle unfold.</p><p>Ten thousand spirit stones was already an exorbitant price for the Blood Essence.  With both bidders seemingly determined to win, the price was certain to climb even higher. No one else wanted to risk overpaying.</p><p>Each bid escalated the tension, and the man in dark robes seemed provoked, sneering, “Friend, with your mere early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation, can you truly afford ten thousand spirit stones? Mr. Kan, I believe we should verify this person's eligibility.”</p><p>Mr. Kan had similar concerns, but hadn't found an opportune moment to voice them. The robed man's challenge provided the perfect pretext. He turned to the man in silver, his tone inquisitive.</p><p>“Friend, what do you say…?”</p><p>The man in silver chuckled, unperturbed. He produced a pouch and casually tossed it to Mr. Kan, arms crossed, calmly stating, “My cultivation may be low, but I have some savings.  Please, Mr. Kan, verify my funds.”</p><p>"But isn't it unfair to only check the next person? Shouldn't Mr. Kan treat everyone equally?"</p><p>The cloaked man sneered, "A summer insect cannot discuss ice! For someone of my cultivation, a mere ten thousand spirit stones are nothing!"</p><p>Mr. Kan was startled, his brow furrowing slightly. He glanced at the cloaked man impassively, unsure if he was being arrogant due to his cultivation, or trying to intimidate him by revealing his power.</p><p>Mr. Kan thought quickly, returning the pouch to the man in silver. "Mr. Kan has already checked, your spirit stones are sufficient! You don't know, this senior is a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, and possesses credentials proving ample funds, as I've already verified. If you have no objections, please proceed."</p><p>"So it's a late-stage Foundation Establishment senior! My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>Despite his words, the man in silver showed no respect, not even turning to look at the cloaked man. He said indifferently, "Unfortunately, I urgently need Blood Essence to save a life; it's a necessity, and I cannot yield it to the senior..."</p><p>The cloaked man roared, "Don't you know your place?! Do you think I'm letting you have it? Eleven thousand!"</p><p>"Eleven thousand five hundred!"</p><p>While their bids were smaller in increments, they quickly reached fourteen thousand spirit stones.  Several others who had initially considered participating gave up at this point, leaving the two to continue their back-and-forth.</p><p>"Fourteen thousand five hundred!"</p><p>This price clearly pained the cloaked man; his breathing was heavy, and his voice seemed strained.</p><p>Those sitting near him quickly moved away, fearing unpredictable actions from him.</p><p>The man in silver calmly said, "Fifteen thousand low-grade spirit stones!"</p><p>"You're asking for death!"</p><p>Enraged, the cloaked man unleashed the formidable pressure of a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator onto the man in silver.</p><p>Those nearby were caught in the crossfire; several Qi Condensation cultivators were directly terrified, falling to their knees.</p><p>Chaos erupted in the hall; screams filled the air.</p><p>Mr. Kan's face changed drastically. He hadn't expected such a lack of composure and unwillingness to accept defeat; the man was resorting to violence. He shouted urgently, "Activate the formation quickly!"</p>
