<h1>Chapter 454 The Little North Star Formation</h1><p>Chapter 454 The Little North Star Formation</p><p>“Old geezer, the time’s up, and the outcome is undecided.  It seems we’ll have to resort to the old rules.”</p><p>Several figures flickered in the air, divided into two groups.</p><p>Two stood on the northern side.</p><p>One was a powerfully built, red-haired elder.</p><p>Standing on a cloud, the red-haired elder exuded an extraordinary aura. His face was flushed with a healthy glow; his tiger-like eyes and imposing bearing projected an overwhelming presence. His spiritual power was extremely restrained, with no discernible fluctuations.  Unknown to many, the red-haired elder was the Grandmaster of the Pure Yang Sect, not only the leader of the righteous path but also the undisputed top expert in the Xiaohan region!</p><p>The same was true of the others.</p><p>Beside the red-haired elder was a mysterious figure shrouded in swirling demonic energy, their features completely obscured.</p><p>Opposite them, three figures were suspended in the air.  The central figure was a lean, elderly Daoist, clad in a light green robe and wielding a whisk, his demeanor radiating an otherworldly aura. He faced the red-haired elder without flinching, yet his expression was grave as he silently watched the two battlefields below.</p><p>Behind the Daoist stood two warriors. They were not only strikingly similar in appearance, but their weapons and armor were identical, like twins.</p><p>All five were Yuan Ying masters.</p><p>Five Yuan Ying ancestors, normally elusive figures, had appeared simultaneously!</p><p>The red-haired elder spoke.</p><p>The Daoist turned his gaze to the red-haired elder, pointing his whisk towards the Golden Core battlefield.  He said coldly, “It’s only been five hours, and you’ve been pushed back this far!  A few more hours, and we will completely annihilate you!”</p><p>The red-haired elder roared with laughter, his voice booming. “Old geezer, you’re getting bolder.  Do you think that’s all the manpower Xiaohan has? If you aren’t afraid of the Abyss taking advantage of the situation and severing your lineage, then bring it on! I'll see how you fare as a lone wolf, and whether you still have the leisure to seek treasures in the Purple Micro Palace!”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>The two warriors roared in unison, taking a step forward, their halberds pointed at the red-haired elder, their fighting spirit soaring.</p><p>The next moment…</p><p>A long howl echoed, and the red-haired elder’s aura surged.  A powerful crimson energy erupted from him, radiating an intensely yang and righteous energy. His red hair whipped wildly, like a god descending.</p><p>The mysterious figure seemed to be watching a show.</p><p>Without the mysterious figure’s help, the red-haired elder single-handedly confronted the two Yuan Ying masters. The crimson energy charged fiercely, and he didn’t lose ground.  The two warriors, however, gripped their halberds tightly, their faces grim, seemingly enduring immense pressure.</p><p>The red-haired elder, towering above the two warriors, sneered, “What arrogant young pups dare shout at this old man! What? Do you want to fight me first and settle the score?”</p><p>“Red-haired devil, I haven’t seen you in decades, and your skills have improved!  Retreat!”</p><p>The Daoist sighed softly, waving his whisk, and a shower of starlight fell upon the two warriors. He looked at the red-haired elder one last time.  “Same rules as last time: Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Yuan Ying, best two out of three.”</p><p>The crimson energy pressing down on the two warriors dissipated. They breathed a sigh of relief, their faces showing shock as they silently retreated behind the Daoist.</p><p>The red-haired elder retracted his aura and nodded. “Good! Old rules, best two out of three. The stake is the array materials. The first match will be at the Pointing-to-Heaven Peak.  You’d better prepare, old geezer, lest you lack materials, your array is incomplete, and you miss the optimal time to open the Purple Micro Palace.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about us.  Even if the Skywalking Alliance is poor, we can still set up a small North Star Formation! Let's go!”</p><p>Before the Daoist finished speaking, he and the two warriors vanished.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Foundation Establishment and Golden Core battlefields of the Skywalking Alliance received orders, and after a brief commotion, they retreated in an orderly manner.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing the Skywalking Alliance’s retreat, finally felt relieved, his body extremely exhausted.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on the water’s surface, ignoring his appearance as he recovered, and the others did the same.</p><p>While recovering his qi, Qin Sang gazed at the figures high above.  Although nobody had introduced them, he could guess that they were the Yuan Ying masters from both sides.</p><p>“I wonder if those two Yuan Ying masters from the Boundless Valley were among them?”</p><p>After the three Yuan Ying masters from the Skywalking Alliance left, Qin Sang stared at the remaining two figures, muttering to himself.</p><p>He didn’t recognize either of the Yuan Ying masters. Even his own sect’s ancestor, Dongyang Bo, he had never met.</p><p>What were their identities?</p><p>For three years, neither side’s Yuan Ying masters had appeared. Why were they gathered here now?</p><p>Could it be because of that beam of light?</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to the beam of light and found it seemed slightly larger than last night, but the mirror at the end remained unchanged.</p><p>He hoped there wouldn’t be any major changes.  At least… until he broke through to the False Core stage.</p><p>Qin Sang prayed silently.</p><p>The more powerful cultivators he witnessed, the more powerless he felt, fueling his desperate desire to improve his cultivation.  He felt like a rootless weed, tossed about by the relentless currents of fate, struggling for survival, a single misstep meaning certain death.  Only by achieving sufficient strength could he transcend this helplessness and control his own destiny!</p><p>…</p><p>After the old Taoist priest and the others left, the mysterious figure coldly snorted, "It seems the old geezer still isn't satisfied!  I suggested we concentrate our forces, sealing off the Yun Cang Great Marsh, finding the Zhi Tian Peak, and securing the Star Yuan Stones for ourselves. Let's see how they get into the Zi Wei Palace without them!"</p><p>The red-haired elder slowly shook his head. "Friend Tongyou, you don't know.  I hear the actions of the Zui Yuan are becoming increasingly frequent and aggressive. We mustn't push the old geezer too far, lest he resorts to desperate measures and brings in outside forces. That would only hurt us as well."</p><p>The mysterious figure was none other than the Demon Sect Sovereign, Tongyou Demon Sovereign.</p><p>A leader of the righteous path and a Demon Sect Sovereign – judging by their conversation, not only were they not openly hostile, they seemed to have a considerable degree of familiarity.</p><p>"Zui Yuan…"</p><p>Tongyou Demon Sovereign muttered, his figure vanishing in a flash.</p><p>The red-haired elder glanced downwards, his lips moving.</p><p>Moments later, he too disappeared.</p><p>…</p><p>The blood had long been swallowed by the vast lake.</p><p>After a night of fierce battle, aside from the wounds on their bodies, there seemed to be no trace of the conflict remaining.</p><p>Qin Sang, not yet fully recovered, finally heard the order to retreat, dragging his weary body back to the Zhen Shui Qian Huan Array.</p><p>Entering the  luan dao waters, Qin Sang dismissed his team, about to return to his cave to rest, when he noticed that the Nascent Soul stage experts hadn't dispersed, but had all entered Guan Xing Island.</p><p>"Could something else be happening?"</p><p>Thinking of the strange beam of light, Qin Sang felt that things would certainly not end so simply.</p><p>Unfortunately, no one could answer his question.</p><p>Filled with doubt and worry, he returned to his cave, activated the protective barriers, and went into seclusion to cultivate, awaiting the next battle.</p>
