<h1>Chapter 1601: The Grand Assembly Begins</h1><p>Wearing the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand, it's like controlling a real beast.</p><p>A ferocious aura constantly assaults the user.</p><p>To control the bone hand, this is unavoidable, it cannot be erased, this drawback must be endured.</p><p>Of course, with Qin Sang's cultivation, suppressing the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand is not a problem.</p><p>"Remembered?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Shen Chen.</p><p>Shen Chen, just shocked by the ferocious aura of the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand, swallowed his saliva and nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, put away the treasure, left Feiyun Ferry, and to save time, flew directly with Shen Chen back to Pushan Mountain.</p><p>He brought Shen Chen back to the Xie family and found him a pavilion in the Qingxu Illusionary Realm.</p><p>"From now on, you will cultivate here. Until your cultivation is accomplished, unless necessary, do not go out! If you need anything, let Xie An arrange it for you."</p><p>Shen Chen's face fell, he dared not disobey Qin Sang's orders, repeatedly agreeing, secretly thinking that it's not bad not going out, such a good cave dwelling, with someone serving him, it's an environment that many people dream of.</p><p>He is also able to endure loneliness, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to thoroughly research the art of refinement and reach the mid-Golden Core stage.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Xie An to take Shen Chen to cultivate and turned to enter his cave dwelling.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>His second self continuously absorbed the chilling煞 energy from the mysterious ice disk.</p><p>Sensing the presence of his main body, the second self interrupted its cultivation, the second Nascent Soul flew out from the top of his head, returning to its main body, and while being nurtured, the main body also learned of the second self's progress.</p><p>A moment later, a look of surprise flashed in the main body's eyes.</p><p>The second self's progress was slower than expected, and it had not yet fully cultivated the "Ice Soul Divine Light".</p><p>However, the reason was not that it encountered a bottleneck.</p><p>In fact, after the second self began absorbing the chilling煞 energy, combined with its previous deep accumulation, the progress of this Dao technique was very smooth.</p><p>The reason why it took so long was because while cultivating the Dao technique, the second self and the mysterious ice disk were together day and night, leading to new discoveries.</p><p>Upon obtaining the mysterious ice disk, Qin Sang had an idea, since this treasure could assist in cultivating the "Ice Soul Divine Light", could it also help the second self's cultivation method?</p><p>With this in mind, the second self conducted verification during its cultivation, and unexpectedly, there was progress!</p><p>The second self first absorbed the Ice Soul Gang Qi, then refined two Kan Shen Pearls.  During the years his main body was in seclusion, he also cultivated intermittently, his realm had reached the peak of the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The second self is different from Liuli.</p><p>Liuli's cultivation had reached the required level, but because she was trapped by an evil skill, her mind was unstable, and she had been unable to break through. After Ice Soul sealed her emotions, her path and the Ice Soul Divine Light were tightly bound together; at the moment of the Divine Ability's completion, she suppressed her inner demons and forcefully broke through.</p><p>For the second self, the "Ice Soul Divine Light" is merely a Dao technique.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the late Nascent Soul stage was a major hurdle, and he did not expect the second self to break through quickly. He originally planned to focus on his main body first and slowly seek opportunities for the second self, but unexpectedly, he obtained a chance from the mysterious ice disk.</p><p>Worthy of being a treasure brought into the tomb by the Water Phase Master, the mysterious ice disk is indeed a strange treasure!</p><p>Of course, the second self currently only sensed an opportunity; it still needs to refine the "Ice Soul Divine Light" and have a certain level of control over the chilling煞 energy before it can deduce the cultivation method and sort out the clues.</p><p>In the following years, Qin Sang's main body also remained in the Qingxu Illusionary Realm.</p><p>He remained in seclusion for a full seven years.</p><p>The main body and the second self stayed in the cave dwelling without moving.</p><p>In the cave dwelling, two figures sat facing each other, the mysterious ice disk floating near the second self, the Sky Eye Butterfly perched beside the main body, the demonic fire and the energy of the Near Dragon Saliva alternately appeared.</p><p>The three operated independently, single-mindedly.</p><p>For seven years, this scene remained almost unchanged.</p><p>Suddenly, the main body seemed to sense something and abruptly opened its eyes, its eyes shooting out sharp light, staring intently at the hands of the second self.</p><p>Then the Sky Eye Butterfly reacted, as if waking from a dream, looked at the second self in a dazed manner, subconsciously flapped its wings and rubbed against Qin Sang's main body, then once again focused on refining the energy of the Near Dragon Saliva.</p><p>The second self, at some point, had folded its hands on its knees, its palms in a moon-holding posture, the power of the Ice Soul Divine Light gathering in its palms, rising into thick cold mist.</p><p>If Qin Sang had seen Liuli's breakthrough, he would have immediately noticed the difference.</p><p>The commotion Liuli created back then was much smaller than the second self's, with only a layer of cold air.</p><p>At this time, the second self's entire body was almost enveloped in thick cold mist, its figure almost invisible; part of the cold mist was formed by the Ice Soul Divine Light affecting the environment, but most of it was the manifestation of the chilling煞 energy!</p><p>As time went on, the second self gradually gathered the cold mist, finally merging it all into its palms, into the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>In its hands, it held a snow-white ice ball, completely opaque.</p><p>Holding a snow-white ice orb, the avatar silently chanted an incantation.  A mysterious ice plate trembled slightly, and wisps of chilling energy flowed from it towards the avatar—or rather, towards the ice orb in the avatar's hand, merging seamlessly within.</p><p>Until now, the avatar's actions had been cautious. This was the first time such a large amount of chilling energy had been drawn in so forcefully.</p><p>The cave's temperature plummeted, plunging into extreme cold.</p><p>"Whoosh...whoosh..."</p><p>A howling wind.  The main body didn't feel the fierce wind; the sound emanated from the ice orb in the avatar's hand.  Inside the orb, a miniature cold storm was brewing, brimming with immensely violent power—enough to destroy the cave if it exploded!</p><p>Soon, the orb's surface distorted, gradually transforming into a white vortex.  Vast chilling energy was confined within, its instability clearly visible.  Despite this, the avatar continued, intently focusing on the vortex in their palm, constantly infusing it with more chilling energy.</p><p>The wind howled more fiercely, echoing within the small cave. The vortex's arms began to leak cold energy—a sign of collapse!</p><p>Finally, the avatar let out a low cry, their internal energy fluctuating. The vortex suddenly contracted!</p><p>A breathtaking sight unfolded. The violent energy, on the verge of eruption, was forcibly compressed, shrinking from the size of a palm to a white speck of light, which was abruptly absorbed into the avatar's body.</p><p>The next moment, the avatar shuddered, their eyes emitting an unusual cold light.</p><p>The main body shifted their gaze to the avatar's face, standing ready.  The avatar's breath rose and fell erratically, their body seeming to churn with turbulent waves.  The cold light in their eyes intensified, until their pupils turned icy white, as if sealed by frost.</p><p>"Huu..."</p><p>After a silent moment, the avatar exhaled deeply.  The cold light in their eyes quickly receded, their expression returning to normal, and their breathing calmed.</p><p>Seeing this, the main body relaxed, breaking into a smile.</p><p>The Ice Soul Radiance was finally perfected!</p><p>After a period of meditation, the avatar fully recovered, awakening from their meditative state.  They exited the cave with the main body, silently chanting incantations. A white cold light welled up in their eyes, their pupils instantly turning icy white—exactly as before.</p><p>"Swish!"</p><p>A point of white light suddenly appeared in the void, instantly exploding outward, freezing a large expanse of space. The frozen area was filled with a thick chilling aura, the scale of which was felt even by Shen Chen, who was cultivating on the other side of the Clear Void Realm.</p><p>The avatar and the main body exchanged a glance.</p><p>The Ice Soul Radiance was indeed different, lacking the subtlety of its original form, but its speed and power far surpassed the Glass Radiance.  A double-edged sword.</p><p>...</p><p>Next,</p><p>the avatar continued their seclusion in the Clear Void Realm. Qin Sang had originally planned to send the avatar out after mastering the Ice Soul Radiance, significantly increasing their strength. The avatar would carry the Gu God Token and attempt to contact the Gu God Sect.</p><p>Since the chance for a breakthrough had arrived, cultivation took precedence. With sufficient strength, fewer things needed to be feared, making actions much easier.</p><p>Once the main body refined the Dragon's Saliva and the Demonic Fire Origin, and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly and the avatar both achieved breakthroughs, the main body and the avatar would be two great cultivators, each mastering top-tier divine abilities and spiritual treasures.</p><p>Below the Transformation Stage, they would be unmatched!</p><p>This was a temptation no one could resist, unless there was new progress on their most important matters. Otherwise, Qin Sang's choice was to continue their cultivation.</p><p>After mastering the Ice Soul Radiance, the avatar devoted all their energy to cultivation, reviewing the Clear Micro Record from the beginning, searching for points of synergy between the cultivation technique and the chilling energy, seeking opportunities for breakthroughs.</p><p>The main body would occasionally go out to guide Shen Chen and maintain contact with the Six States Hall.</p><p>After a late-night conversation with Qin Sang, Mu Tongshu secretly mobilized the Six States Hall's forces to investigate the origin of the meteorite fragments.</p><p>However, the Ullambana Festival was approaching, and the Six States Hall, as a merchant guild, needed to fully prepare for this grand event.  They couldn't spare many people, and the investigation had made little progress.</p><p>Qin Sang knew there was no need to rush, so they didn't urge them and turned their attention to the Ullambana Festival.</p><p>This Ullambana Festival wouldn't only stir the hearts of the Central Plains cultivators; from the Northern Wasteland to the Western Desert, the entire cultivation world would focus its attention on Jin Yu Prefecture.</p><p>In the cultivation world, stability was never the norm.</p><p>Without a Transformation Stage cultivator to deter them, the Eight Scenic Spots and the Ganlu Chan Monastery's positions might not be shaken, nor would the Central Plains' layout change, but unrest was inevitable.</p><p>Countless schemers lurked in the shadows.</p><p>All kinds of chaos would erupt.</p><p>This was the opportunity Qin Sang had been waiting for.</p><p>When the time was ripe, the main body and the avatar would emerge, maneuvering events and shaking the world!</p><p>Seasons turned.</p><p>The flora and fauna of the Qingxu Illusionary Realm change with the seasons, experiencing growth and decay.  Regardless of the changes in the cultivation world, the small Fufu County remains unaffected for now. The Xie family and the Loutai Temple continue to support each other, flourishing.</p><p>Pushan and the Loutai Temple are growing stronger.  New disciples are forming golden cores, and those nearing a breakthrough are sent to the Qingxu Illusionary Realm.  They know this is the place where their ancestor meditates, and they are very respectful. They are all curious about the two restricted areas within the Qingxu Illusionary Realm.</p><p>One is Qin Sang's cave dwelling.</p><p>The other is the tower where Shen Chen cultivates, accessible only to Xie An.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't want people to connect her true form with her avatar.</p><p>“If only this peace could last!”</p><p>Most disciples think the same, but occasional news of tragedies from the north reminds them that killing continues to exist, though it hasn’t reached Pushan yet.</p><p>…</p><p>“I almost forgot the Ullambana festival…”</p><p>A soft sigh echoed from within the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang's true form awoke from meditation, putting away the fire lotus and demon banner. The Tianmu butterfly, having lost its source of near-dragon spittle energy, also woke, transforming into an ordinary butterfly and returning to Qin Sang's dantian.</p><p>It's almost time for the Ullambana festival.</p><p>She glanced at her avatar.</p><p>The avatar was still diligently studying cultivation techniques, wisps of chilling煞 energy swirling around its fingertips. It had made significant progress since closing itself off for cultivation over a decade ago, but still lacked a bit.</p><p>The same goes for her true form; only about half of the near-dragon spittle has been refined.</p><p>That's why she hasn't participated in any of the recent treasure exchanges or auctions.</p><p>However, the Ullambana festival is not to be missed, so Qin Sang plans to go early.</p><p>Leaving her cave, she summoned Xie An.</p><p>“Has anyone from the Bunian Mountain sent word?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Xie An shook his head. “I recently inquired with other sects in Zhuozhou, but we cannot contact Bunian Mountain.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.  “What are Situ Yu and Lu Zhang doing? Is Bunian Mountain really going into seclusion for a hundred years, completely abandoning its interests in the Ullambana festival?”</p><p>She had planned to have her avatar attend, using the identity of the Xie family ancestor to participate in the Ullambana festival with Bunian Mountain, making it legitimate.</p><p>With Bunian Mountain’s deliberate closure, her avatar going alone would likely attract the attention of Bunian Mountain's enemies, leading to unavoidable provocations.</p><p>So she’ll go as her true form, using the Six States Hall's channels.</p><p>To avoid another assassination attempt, Qin Sang had her avatar interrupt its cultivation; the second primordial spirit entered her true form, and they set off together.</p><p>She didn't rush to Jinyu State, instead going to Feiyun Ferry first.</p><p>Jiang Mu happened to be at Feiyun Ferry as well.</p><p>As soon as they saw each other, Jiang Mu couldn’t hide his smile.</p><p>“Elder Qin, your arrival is perfectly timed! The Hall has just received a batch of treasures that we are preparing to transport to Jinyu State for auction. All three Hall Masters are unavailable, and I’m short-handed… things aren't peaceful in the north!”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, “Brother Jiang, you weren't waiting for me, were you?”</p><p>Jiang Mu sighed, “Things are indeed more chaotic than before. I've been feeling uneasy lately! Even during the most stable times, the trading company has been robbed several times. In the most vicious incident, not only were goods stolen, but over a hundred people on the ship were killed. The Hall Master was furious, personally pursuing the culprits into the Western Desert, and eliminating them all, sending a warning to the Central Plains!”</p><p>The Six States Hall most wants to prevent the Central Plains' stability from being shattered.</p><p>As they talked, they flew towards the treasure ship docked on the north bank of Feiyun Ferry.</p><p>“Have there been any changes to the Ullambana festival’s procedures?” Qin Sang gazed westward towards the Ganlu Monastery.</p><p>The procedures have been largely the same in past years.</p><p>If it suddenly changes this year, the Ganlu Monastery certainly has ulterior motives.</p><p>“There are some differences this time.”</p><p>Thinking Qin Sang was concerned about trading opportunities, Jiang Mu explained carefully.</p><p>“This year’s festival has two major auctions, three days before and after the festival itself, both orchestrated by the Jinyu Gate. They're incredibly wealthy and are rumored to be bringing out many rare treasures, not to be missed.</p><p>“Therefore, there aren't many significant treasure exchanges before the first auction; everyone is preparing for it.</p><p>“Three days after the first auction, the festival officially begins, following the usual pattern – alchemy, weaponry, talismans, and other competitions and debates. It’s not particularly relevant to us; we’ll just enjoy the spectacle.</p><p>“During the festival, there will be treasure exchanges every night. Vice Hall Master Jiang You will compile a list then.</p><p>“Our Hall is hosting treasure exchanges, and we hope Elder Qin will attend, to deter any unscrupulous individuals.</p><p>“There’s something unusual about this year’s festival. Rumors of missing Nascent Soul cultivators have circulated for years, and some hidden forces might resurface. I suspect that these treasure exchanges will not only involve trading of treasures, but also some clandestine collusion. Elder Qin, if you don't want to be caught up in any turmoil, don't make any rash promises…”</p>
