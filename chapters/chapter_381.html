<h1>Chapter 374: Ambush</h1><p>“Everyone, my task is complete.  Beyond this point, either I'm unable to scout further, or it's fraught with danger. You'll have to explore on your own.”</p><p>Kong Xin retrieved three jade slips, marked their general location on the map, and handed them over.</p><p>Qin Sang’s spiritual awareness swept through the jade slips. He discovered the Yellow Dragon Grass was located to the northeast.  A direct route, barring any encounters, would take only a few hours.</p><p>The Yellow Dragon Grass's location was not far from the second level of Boundless Valley.</p><p>The so-called three levels of the valley weren't defined by distinct terrain changes, but rather by ancient restricting formations within the valley. The term "levels" was a later convention.</p><p>Between the first and second levels, there were several well-known paths through the formations, all marked on the map purchased from the Skywind Pavilion.</p><p>However, there were no recognized safe paths leading to the third level of Boundless Valley.</p><p>“This is the other half of your payment.  Thank you for guiding us.”</p><p>Yun Youzi tossed Kong Xin a storage pouch.  He and Qin Sang then took flight.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang glanced back at Kong Xin and his two companions.</p><p>Throughout their journey, the individuals who had been tailing them never revealed themselves. It felt like mere coincidence.</p><p>However, as long as they weren't being targeted, they weren't concerned. Yun Youzi’s business was paramount.</p><p>…</p><p>A dense forest of towering trees, lush and green.</p><p>Such a sight was uncommon in Boundless Valley. Given the valley’s chaotic nature, these ancient trees must have been incredibly fortunate to have survived undamaged.</p><p>The forest was eerily silent, devoid of any sound.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of light landed before the forest, revealing a figure. It was Bao, who had parted ways with Qin Sang and Yun Youzi.</p><p>Holding a jade slip, he looked around, examining the forest. He then compared the jade slip with his map, a look of delight spreading across his face.</p><p>“Not a single beast encountered on the way. Lucky me…”</p><p>Bao muttered to himself, storing the jade slip. Suddenly, he summoned a flying sword.</p><p>The sword flashed, darting towards the forest.</p><p>Just as the sword was about to touch the trees, ripples appeared in the air. The scene before Bao distorted, the ancient trees shattering like reflections in water.</p><p>The forest was an illusion created by an ancient formation.</p><p>Bao’s eyes sharpened with vigilance. He urged his sword forward, breaking the illusion. The formation offered no resistance. Bao relaxed slightly, observing the scene within.</p><p>Hidden beneath the illusion was a narrow, damp, and dark canyon. While the canyon itself appeared tranquil and safe, strange sounds emanated from its depths.</p><p>Amplified by the canyon, the sounds became even more unsettling.</p><p>Hearing them, Bao’s face showed concern. Yet, he continued to push his flying sword, dispelling the illusion entirely.</p><p>Just as the illusion shattered, disaster struck.</p><p>A sharp blue light shot from the depths of the canyon with incredible speed.</p><p>Encased within the blue light was a flying sword that looked remarkably familiar.</p><p>Bao’s expression shifted.  He reacted swiftly, twisting his body.  But the attacker had chosen their moment perfectly. Though Bao managed to dodge several times, the flying sword pierced his chest.</p><p>However, no blood flowed from the wound.</p><p>Simultaneously, several feet away, Bao reappeared.  Aside from slightly ragged breathing, he was unharmed.</p><p>The figure pierced by the sword had been a mere clone.</p><p>A figure emerged from the canyon, retrieving the flying sword.  He scowled at Bao, clearly frustrated that his carefully timed attack had been foiled.</p><p>“Kong Xin!”</p><p>Bao, recognizing the man, wasn't surprised.  He snorted, “I knew you were no good!”</p><p>“Not at all! Not at all!”</p><p>Kong Xin shook his head in denial. “I’ve always been law-abiding, which is why I have such a good reputation in Boundless Valley.  This time, I’m forced by circumstances... I need your vital essence…”</p><p>Before he could finish, Kong Xin’s pale face flushed crimson. He clutched his chest, coughing violently as if trying to expel his lungs.</p><p>“So you’re a sickly wretch! And you dare to plot against me!”</p><p>Bao’s eyes lit up. He sneered and attacked without hesitation.</p><p>Kong Xin hurriedly raised his sword to defend, but hampered by his condition, his movements grew erratic.  He was quickly suppressed by Bao.  After a short struggle, Kong Xin's breathing became increasingly labored.</p><p>Suddenly, Kong Xin shouted, “Are you just going to watch?!  When are you going to make your move?!”</p><p>Bao was startled.</p><p>Behind him, a cackling laughter echoed, “I thought you were powerful enough to handle this yourself, Kong!  I didn’t expect you’d need my help…”</p><p>Space distorted, and a figure in black robes stepped out of thin air, blocking Bao’s escape route.</p><p>Kong Xin snorted, “Less talk!  Make it quick!  If we miss our chance, the others will escape.”</p><p>The robed figure grumbled, “If you hadn’t changed the plan and brought them out of the cave early, making all my efforts pointless, they’d already be dead.  Why this charade?”</p><p>“What do you know?!”</p><p>Kong Xin retorted angrily, “How was I to know he’d have such a sharp flying sword?! I wagered everything I had with Old Devil Ji for the Blue Light Sword, and it could barely scratch the stone, yet his sword sliced through it like butter! Do you think I didn’t want to delay them? Luring them to the cave already made them suspicious.  Any unusual move and they would’ve killed me on the spot!”</p><p>The robed figure exclaimed, "What? Old Devil Ji’s Blue Light Sword is one of the sharpest top-grade artifacts.  There's something sharper?  What grade is it? Could it be a magic treasure?"</p><p>“Judging by how easily he wields it, it's not a magic treasure.  Perhaps it’s been enhanced with some rare material…”</p><p>…</p><p>The two conversed as if Bao wasn't even there.</p><p>Bao’s expression darkened.  He understood the gist of their conversation.  He hadn’t realized Kong Xin’s ambition extended to wiping them all out in the cave.</p><p>He was thankful for the sharpness of Qingfeng’s flying sword.  If Kong Xin had delayed them any longer, their exhaustion might have indeed led to their demise.</p><p>Bao knew he had to escape quickly, or his chances were grim.</p><p>The robed figure was an unknown, but Kong Xin’s illness was genuine.</p><p>With that, Bao soared into the air, choosing to break through in Kong Xin’s direction.</p><p>Facing Bao’s desperate gamble, Kong Xin’s expression remained unchanged. A flash of blood-red light emanated from his forehead, as if a seal had been broken.  His aura surged.</p><p>Mid-stage Foundation Establishment!</p>
