<h1>Chapter 543: Abandonment</h1><p>The main event is about to begin.</p><p>Even the most potent external elixirs are ultimately external.  Only by forming one's own Golden Core can one truly take that next step on the path of immortality.  Whether the experiences left by those predecessors are true or false will soon be verified.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang suddenly left his cave dwelling. He first sent a message to Yun Youzi to report his safety, informing him that he might be in seclusion for a few more days. Then, after searching the deep mountains, he finally found a spiritual vein.</p><p>When forming the Golden Core, heaven and earth contend, winds and clouds gather, drawing in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to nourish the body. Other cultivators, when attempting to form their Golden Core, invariably seek out caves rich in spiritual energy, hoping for a higher success rate.  Qin Sang, fearing that he would lose the opportune moment, didn’t have time for a thorough search.</p><p>Although this cave dwelling was not as good as his Spirit Spring cave, it was still usable.  If he succeeded in forming the core, it would be more than enough to nourish his body and wouldn't affect the process.</p><p>Qin Sang had confirmed that there were no powerful demons in this mountain range, so he wasn't worried about the phenomenon of Golden Core formation attracting trouble. The spiritual vein wasn't conspicuous, and its range wasn't large, but the spiritual energy was quite dense.</p><p>Qin Sang drove away the mountain beasts, seizing the best cave dwelling on the spiritual vein.  For this, he gave a severe beating to a peak-level mortal-stage black bear inhabiting the cave.</p><p>After clearing away the foul smell from the cave and setting up a protective array, augmented with a spirit-gathering array, Qin Sang sat cross-legged and focused on his cultivation.</p><p>Before long, his dantian was full, restored to its peak.  In the cave, due to the spirit-gathering array, the spiritual energy was extremely dense.  At the moment Qin Sang was fully recovered, the spiritual energy in the cave suddenly exhibited a strange fluctuation.</p><p>Simultaneously, outside the cave, the sun was shining brightly, and the sky was cloudless. At that moment, the sunlight on this mountaintop suddenly dimmed.  Several dark clouds appeared from nowhere, followed by a rising wind that quickly intensified into a gale, bending the trees and scattering withered leaves.</p><p>The birds and beasts nearby were startled by the sudden phenomenon, sensing the unusual aura, and were terrified, scrambling to flee the mountain.</p><p>Around this mountain, in the deep mountains, there were many uncivilized wild beasts that, by chance, had developed some intelligence, instinctively absorbing the essence of the sun and moon, beginning to transform into demonic beasts. They were highly sensitive to changes in spiritual energy.</p><p>One by one, they rose on their hind legs, gazing towards this mountain. Though they didn't understand the cause of this phenomenon, a deep sense of envy arose in their hearts.</p><p>It left them scratching their heads in confusion.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Unaware of the external changes, Qin Sang, whose mind was entirely focused on himself, suddenly let out a soft exclamation. He hadn't expected this to happen.</p><p>After fully recovering, he thought he would need to spend some time in seclusion for careful contemplation before any breakthrough.  Unexpectedly, the signs of Golden Core formation appeared immediately.</p><p>It felt like things had reached their natural conclusion.  He could accomplish it effortlessly if he wished!</p><p>He remembered that the writings of his predecessors mentioned that forming a Golden Core allowed for no slack; one needed careful contemplation to seize the fleeting opportunity, only then could one truly succeed.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know if it was due to the jade Buddha stabilizing his heart, the method of condensing煞 and tempering罡, his exceptionally deep cultivation base, or a combination of the three.</p><p>Forming the Golden Core was far easier than he'd imagined!</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang had no more hesitation.  Without a second thought, he cast aside all distracting thoughts, focused on the core principle, and attempted to form the Golden Core!</p><p>The moment his mind was set, his spiritual energy spun wildly within his dantian.</p><p>Outside the mountain, the changes intensified.  The dark clouds gathered, more and more, until they enveloped a vast area around the mountain.  Within the clouds, streaks of silver light appeared intermittently, and the dull rumble of thunder grew increasingly clear.</p><p>A howling wind swept through the mountains, carrying sand and stones.  The spiritual energy around the mountain range was drawn towards the location of the cave, forming a funnel shape centered on the cave, clearly visible to the naked eye.</p><p>As the celestial phenomena reached a certain point, the true spectacle of Golden Core formation was about to occur.</p><p>Suddenly, the wind and clouds dissipated, and the lightning vanished.  Cracks appeared on the funnel, which then shattered suddenly, scattering the spiritual energy.</p><p>In an instant, tranquility returned.  The sun shone brightly upon the mountain range, dispelling the darkness.  The previous phenomena seemed to have never existed.</p><p>In the cave, Qin Sang clutched his dantian, his face flushed, breathing heavily.  Deep in his eyes, there remained traces of both hesitation and resolution.</p><p>“If others knew someone had voluntarily given up forming a Golden Core, they’d surely call them a fool, right?”</p><p>Qin Sang calmed his breath and murmured to himself.</p><p>The attempt to form a Golden Core wasn't a failure; Qin Sang deliberately stopped the process.</p><p>“My spiritual energy didn't revert, and the opportunity remains. I can form a Golden Core anytime. Otherwise, I'm afraid I couldn't resist such a great temptation…”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly, looking down at his dantian. Thankfully, he'd made his decision quickly, stopping the process as soon as he noticed the signs, preventing injury.</p><p>He did so because at the last moment, Qin Sang realized his foundational injuries would negatively affect his Golden Core.</p><p>Yun Youzi’s master hadn't been wrong.  Damaged foundations didn't prevent Golden Core formation; Qin Sang's process had been smooth.</p><p>However, just as he was about to form the core, he suddenly understood: a Golden Core formed with damaged foundations would also be flawed.</p><p>He remembered Yun Youzi's words:</p><p>Golden Core.</p><p>"Golden" represents something strong, permanent, and indestructible; "Core" represents something perfect, complete, and flawless.</p><p>Qin Sang's Golden Core, due to his incomplete foundation and weakened dantian, would be imperfect, inherently weaker than other cultivators at the same level, much like during the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Qin Sang now realized that his foundational injuries wouldn't simply vanish. The impact would worsen as his cultivation deepened, becoming increasingly significant.</p><p>As the saying goes, a Golden Core decision is irreversible.  Once such a flawed Golden Core was formed, rectifying it would likely be harder than healing his foundation.  Qin Sang couldn't be sure how effective the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit would be.</p><p>Therefore, at the last moment, Qin Sang made a decision that would astound countless cultivators: he resisted the immense temptation and voluntarily interrupted the Golden Core formation.</p><p>Without news of the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, he might have hesitated. But now, with the fruit located in the Ziwei Palace—a place accessible within the next two years—his decision was clear.</p><p>He possessed external pills, Flying Night Rakshasas, Void Thunder, and magical treasures...</p><p>His skills were such that even without a Golden Core, he was no match for Golden Core cultivators. And with his cultivation displayed only at the Pseudo-Golden Core stage, he might even be underestimated, giving him an opportunity to use a "wolf in sheep's clothing" tactic.</p><p>But these weren't the primary reasons.</p><p>His transformed spiritual energy was remarkably stable; Golden Core formation for Qin Sang was as natural as regular cultivation.</p><p>He could achieve it at will, anytime, anywhere.</p><p>Even in the Ziwei Palace, where spiritual energy isn't scarce.</p><p>So why risk the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit being ineffective, and rush the process for a year or two?</p>
