<h1>Chapter 917: Subjugation</h1><p>Looking at the shattered body of the Si Mo Cave Master, Qin Sang’s face showed a thoughtful expression. Then, runes surged from his palm, and the vital essence from the corpse flowed towards his hand.</p><p>The light of the runes flickered like flames, refining the blood essence, leaving only the purest qi.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang had only a dragon-eye-sized crimson bead in his hand. With a slight tremor of his arm, he reduced the Si Mo Cave Master's shriveled corpse to dust.</p><p>Qin Sang was using a secret technique from the “Cultivating the Yuan Demon Fetus” to refine the blood essence.  Ingesting and refining it into his external avatar would rapidly increase his cultivation—a fast-track method.</p><p>However, this method would make the external avatar more bloodthirsty and harder to control, planting the seeds of backlash. Even with the jade Buddha's aid, suppressing it would be difficult.</p><p>The first to suffer would be the avatar's master.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang would avoid using this method unless the external avatar could independently reach the peak of the Golden Core stage.</p><p>He put away the blood bead.</p><p>At this time, the avatar flew out of the Poison Island, appearing instantly beside Qin Sang.</p><p>After interrogating the Si Mo Cave Master's subordinates, he informed Qin Sang of the situation. Qin Sang nodded, instructing his external avatar to stay behind to guard the island, while he himself took the two-headed snake and went to deal with the remaining issues.</p><p>A sea area with countless reefs.</p><p>The wind and clouds changed abruptly.</p><p>A bolt of lightning from a clear sky struck, scaring the birds and beasts on the surrounding deserted islands half to death.</p><p>“Whoosh…”</p><p>Countless birds took flight from the forest.</p><p>Then, two figures materialized, appearing on a small reef. They looked at a dark spot on the island and several charred corpses.</p><p>Qin Sang, with the two-headed snake, flashed to the corpses and identified the body of the Si Mo Cave Master's Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>This person was the helper the Si Mo Cave Master had contacted. Qin Sang had left a Sky-Eyed Butterfly insect to follow him, leading to this location.</p><p>This person was second only to the Si Mo Cave Master in the Cave, possessing formidable cultivation and accompanied by another early Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang tested the power of his "Servant Lightning Technique" on them. The result was clear: including this Xun cultivator, everyone was utterly defenseless, all perished under the thunder.</p><p>After killing them, Qin Sang's face was pale, his True Qi reduced to one-tenth. But his physical strength far surpassed that of the Dou Niu Peak disciples; he easily withstood the backlash of the "Servant Lightning Technique" and still retained considerable fighting ability.</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>Qin Sang used spirit stones to recover his True Qi, secretly nodding his head, a look of satisfaction on his face.</p><p>Without even activating the Heavenly Demon Transformation, his casting of this technique already possessed the power to severely injure or kill late-stage Golden Core cultivators. Even experts like the Fang young master and Master Lu would suffer a great loss if caught off guard.</p><p>No wonder, even with the inherent risks of the "Servant Lightning Technique," the Lan Dou Sect was willing to invest so many resources in it.</p><p>The two-headed snake stared wide-eyed at the corpses, equally shocked by the power of the Servant Lightning Technique.  For over a decade, it had often seen Qin Sang risking his life to battle the heavenly thunder during storms.</p><p>It never imagined he was cultivating such a terrifying divine ability.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, sending out a spiritual fire to erase all traces of the battle. He looked into the distance and said calmly, “Let's go.  The Si Mo Cave no longer needs to exist.”</p><p>Ten days later, Qin Sang returned, stained with blood.</p><p>After confirming that the Si Mo Cave had no powerful backing, he eradicated the entire organization. Only days after Qin Sang's departure did nearby forces notice anything unusual. To their astonishment, despite thorough investigations, they found no trace whatsoever.</p><p>They could only surmise that a powerful cultivator had passed by, displeased by the Si Mo Cave's actions, and effortlessly eliminated them.</p><p>For a time, nearby cultivators were filled with anxiety.</p><p>Various factions controlled their subordinates, acting much more cautiously.</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware, and uninterested, in the impact he had caused.  He returned directly to Poison Island to resume his arduous cultivation.</p><p>“Junior greets senior!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang enter, the three scholars hurriedly bowed.</p><p>The avatar tossed them into a quiet room and resumed his own cultivation. For days, they had been anxiously awaiting their fate.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's weary appearance, the scholar and the middle-aged woman exchanged glances, secretly alarmed.</p><p>The day they escaped to Poison Island, they were trapped in the illusionary array and did not see the battle outside. However, seeing that the Si Mo Cave Master had not reappeared, they already guessed the outcome.</p><p>“Senior, the Si Mo Cave Master… ”</p><p>The scholar cautiously asked.</p><p>Qin Sang responded with a noncommittal "Oh," and said lightly, "That old demon is dead. I went out for a few days and dealt with the chief demon's henchmen to prevent any future trouble.  I forgot to ask—what are your names?"</p><p>The scholar's reaction was a mixture of joy and alarm.  He was relieved that the demon who coveted his daughter was gone, but startled by the seemingly effortless way Qin Sang described eliminating the demon's followers.  Their family was trapped on the island, leaving him uncertain whether to feel relief or apprehension.</p><p>The scholar quickly and respectfully replied to Qin Sang's question, "My disciples of Baiyan Valley all use Bai as their surname.  My name is Bai Zhongqiu, my wife is Bai Hong, and you may call my daughter Ying'er."</p><p>Following her father's subtle cue, Ying'er politely stepped forward and bowed deeply, "My name is Ying'er, and I greet you, senior."</p><p>"Senior, we owe you our lives; we shall never forget your kindness..." Bai Zhongqiu and his wife knelt in gratitude.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stop them.  Walking inside and sitting down, he calmly said, "I killed that old demon because I prefer peace and quiet for my cultivation.  The demon was simply unlucky..."</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu's heart sank, instinctively shielding his wife and daughter.</p><p>After a slight pause, Qin Sang said gravely, "The reason I've spared your lives is that I believe you two might be of some use to me."</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu, understanding, immediately knelt, "Senior, please command us; we will go through fire and water for you."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled softly, "No need for such extremes, but there will be some danger.  Your skills are fairly decent; you will gather certain spiritual items and gather intelligence for me. I intend to focus on my cultivation; I'll leave these tasks to you. As for your daughter, with her unique constitution, she would be a prime target for those demons who practice certain cultivation techniques.  She would be in danger outside, so she should stay on the island and cultivate."</p><p>The couple were relieved at first, but their faces fell when they heard Qin Sang intended to keep Ying'er on the island.</p><p>"What?  You object?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu trembled, his expression shifting rapidly. "We obey your instructions, senior.  It will be Ying'er's good fortune to remain by your side and receive your guidance."</p><p>His wife, a middle-aged woman, opened her mouth to speak but didn't dare, clutching her daughter tightly.</p>
