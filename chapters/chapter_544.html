<h1>Chapter 537: A Fresh Start</h1><p>High above, the Fire Gourd and the Ten Directions Yama Banner bobbed in the sea of fire, appearing and disappearing.  Each strike of the magical treasures sent countless flames shooting down, scorching the forests below like falling meteorites, leaving behind shockingly deep craters.  Demonic fire consumed the sky. Mountains trembled. The scene resembled a natural disaster, terrifying the creatures in the mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang countered with fire, his gaze swiftly scanning for advantageous terrain.  At that moment, he noticed a small, sparrow-sized green bird approaching from the distant horizon.  It seemed insignificant, but its speed was astonishing, heading straight for Wu Youdao.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He actively restrained the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, slowing his attack and allowing the bird to approach Wu Youdao.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>Wu Youdao reached out and grasped the bird. It burst into flames, returning to its origin.  Holding the fiery stream, Wu Youdao concentrated, sensing its energy.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang shouted, “Well, Daoist Wu, did I lie to you? I only took the Qiantian Gang Qi, I absolutely did not touch your sect's forbidden area!”</p><p>Wu Youdao glanced at Qin Sang, his eyes flickering.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart leaped with joy.  He said solemnly, “If you continue to press me, Daoist Wu, I have no choice but to detonate this Xuantian Thunder. I believe you have the ability to avoid the explosion, but once we’re both exhausted, when we’re both at our limit and severely injured, how much confidence will you have left?”</p><p>Then, earnestly, he added, “It was my fault to begin with. It’s a laughing matter if it gets out, so I won't breathe a word of this to anyone.”</p><p>“If there’s a next time, Wu will kill you!”</p><p>Wu Youdao coldly warned Qin Sang before waving his hand, recalling the Fire Gourd. A burst of flame erupted beneath his feet, and he soared away.</p><p>“Thank you, Daoist Wu.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed from afar.</p><p>He didn’t dare linger. Once Wu Youdao vanished from sight, he immediately put away the Ten Directions Yama Banner and fled towards the depths of the mountains.  He remained vigilant, checking for pursuers, until he found a hidden cave and slipped inside.</p><p>…</p><p>“Whew!”</p><p>After setting up a restriction to seal the cave, Qin Sang collapsed onto the ground, letting out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Although this battle didn’t reach a life-or-death struggle, in Qin Sang’s view, it was more thrilling and terrifying than any previous battle, making him feel as if he were walking on thin ice.  After all, this was the first time he truly faced a Nascent Soul cultivator.  His control of true energy and the use of magical treasures were still very unfamiliar. Even though he improved bit by bit during the battle, his skills were still far inferior to Wu Youdao's.</p><p>Fortunately, he was unafraid of the Qingyang Demon Fire, while Wu Youdao had to constantly guard against it, never allowing the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire to get close. This offset the difference, preventing Qin Sang from being quickly defeated.</p><p>Wu Youdao probably recognized this advantage and believed he had a chance to capture him.</p><p>Without the Xuantian Thunder as a deterrent, the outcome would have been uncertain.</p><p>Finally escaping danger, Qin Sang rested briefly before sitting cross-legged and inspecting his internal state.</p><p>“This true energy recovery speed is incredibly slow!”</p><p>Qin Sang sensed his Corpse Pill, secretly sighing.</p><p>He calculated that once the Corpse Pill’s true energy was depleted, it would take almost half a day to recover. This meant that he would have to carefully plan every future battle.</p><p>While the Corpse Pill recovered automatically, Qin Sang carefully examined his body.</p><p>The cave was silent.</p><p>Qin Sang sat there for a day and night.</p><p>On the second evening, he withdrew his consciousness from within, his expression grave. He fell into deep thought.</p><p>Over the past day, he had finally sorted out his current situation.</p><p>First, his strength was undoubtedly comparable to a true Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Second, and this was Qin Sang’s biggest concern—the possibility of cultivating techniques.</p><p>The answer was no.</p><p>Due to the double constraints of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the restriction, his true energy could only follow a fixed path.  Qin Sang had tried countless times, and just as before his Corpse Pill formation, he was unable to overcome it.</p><p>This meant that he could no longer cultivate any techniques, and there would be no further improvement.</p><p>Qin Sang now faced a choice, and the degree of his corpse transformation was deepening, leaving him little time to think.</p><p>Should he let his body fully transform into a corpse, following the path of the Corpse Dao?</p><p>Or should he try to undo the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, gambling on whether he could preserve his Corpse Pill?</p><p>Without much hesitation, Qin Sang chose the second path.</p><p>After the corpse transformation, Qin Sang had no idea how to proceed.</p><p>Even those Corpse Dao sects only spoke of cultivators refining corpses, never of someone refining themselves into a corpse.</p><p>Even the amazingly talented Wu Shang hadn’t found a way to break the limitations of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*.</p><p>After corpse transformation, the body would be strengthened, but the primordial spirit would remain unchanged. This meant Qin Sang’s lifespan might be the same as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, only two hundred and fifty years instead of five hundred.</p><p>Within those two hundred and fifty years, Qin Sang would not only have to find suitable Corpse Dao techniques, but also rely on his inferior aptitude to cultivate to the next realm.</p><p>With the Heavenly Corpse Talisman in place, could the Corpse Path secrets allow me to break through my limitations and advance?</p><p>Qin Sang had no idea.</p><p>…</p><p>To possess the strength of a Nascent Soul cultivator, enjoying a hundred years of freedom?  Or to willingly forgo this alluring power and continue pursuing the Dao?</p><p>In the Xiaohan cultivation world, Nascent Soul cultivators are the elite, revered and catered to by all. But to Qin Sang, these are mere illusions.</p><p>After a hundred years, one inevitably returns to dust. What's the point?</p><p>…</p><p>I'm about to become a true corpse cultivator, irreversibly.  If I can't find the Corpse Path secrets, there's no other way but to abandon this body and seize a new one.</p><p>Body snatching isn't without cost.  Afterward, lifespan doesn't increase. And due to the incompatibility of body and soul, unless I obtain the legendary medicine that harmonizes spirit and flesh, future breakthroughs will be extremely unlikely.</p><p>The "Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swords" showed Qin Sang hope in pursuing the Dao.  If there were no subsequent cultivation techniques, that would be fine, but now there are clues to Elder Qingzhu's self-created techniques.  Unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang didn't want to give up.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang's decision wasn't arbitrary.</p><p>He could clearly sense a strong compatibility between himself and the Corpse Pill. This wasn't just externally caused.</p><p>Their connection wasn't solely due to the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the "Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual," but also a result of the fusion of his consciousness and blood during the Corpse Pill's refinement.</p><p>Most notably, during the罡煞冲丹 (Gangsha Chongdan), his spiritual energy carried the heavenly and earthly煞 (sha) energies into the Golden Core.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang estimated he had at least a 30% chance of preserving the Corpse Pill after removing the Heavenly Corpse Talisman!</p><p>If the Corpse Pill could continue to serve him, that would be ideal. He could return to orthodox cultivation and still cultivate the "Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swords."</p><p>Even if the Corpse Pill couldn't become a true Golden Core, it could function as an external pill, allowing him to readily display the strength comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Searching for hidden secrets and auxiliary Golden Core-forming herbs would undoubtedly be much easier.</p><p>If he failed…</p><p>Qin Sang's lips tightened.</p><p>So what if the pill shattered?</p><p>I'll simply start over!</p>
