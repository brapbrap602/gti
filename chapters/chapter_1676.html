<h1>Chapter 1667: Bridge of Rainbow Light</h1><p>When the green vine appeared before Mo Xingdao, his choice to reach for it instantly made him a target.</p><p>Everyone present was a Nascent Soul late-stage cultivator.  Even a hastily launched attack from them was far from ordinary.</p><p>The spot where Mo Xingdao stood erupted in a blinding, multicolored light, like a barrel of paints violently shattered, splattering across the void, forming a chaotic yet strangely harmonious canvas.  The intensity of the spectacle completely obscured Mo Xingdao himself.</p><p>Facing such a siege, anyone present would have felt their scalp tingle.</p><p>Having witnessed Master Huaiyin's fate, Su Zinan knew Mo Xingdao had fallen into a trap.  Another demonic cultivator, hidden in the shadows, was about to deliver the killing blow.</p><p>Wasn't this the very situation Su Zinan had been waiting for?</p><p>His Three Corpse Demonic Banner lacked a main soul. Imprisoning another Nascent Soul late-stage cultivator would complete the three souls, perfecting the demonic artifact, a matter of paramount importance to him.</p><p>In comparison, even the Fire Rhinoceros Horn was less crucial.</p><p>Since entering the Formless Immortal Sect, he had forgone immediately entering the Immortal Palace to pursue Elder Yanshan. Later, he had schemed to join forces with Old Devil Fan and others to ambush Qin Sang.  Everything had been in service of this single goal.</p><p>The opportunities within the Immortal Palace and Emperor Bestowal Mountain were, in his eyes, merely catalysts for chaos, creating the perfect opportunities for him.</p><p>Therefore, seeing Mo Xingdao's predicament, he unhesitatingly chose to strike while the iron was hot, rather than warn Mo Xingdao or confront the female demonic cultivator.  If Master Huaiyin hadn't been a body cultivator, unsuitable for the demonic banner, he would have done the same to him then.</p><p>Qin Sang was his target, and so was Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Even True Person Zilei and Old Devil Fan – given the chance, he wouldn't hesitate to act against them.</p><p>Back then, Su Zinan had used Old Devil Lu's insights on Deity Transformation as bait, enticing Mo Xingdao to journey with him, traversing the Northern Wastelands, venturing south to the Central Plains, then east across the Eastern Sea, and finally arriving in the Southern Barbaric Lands.</p><p>During their travels, he had benefited from Mo Xingdao's assistance, achieving numerous goals.  If he could capture other prey with Mo Xingdao's help, he would naturally be delighted.</p><p>If not, he could at least probe Mo Xingdao's depths.</p><p>Now, Su Zinan felt he had thoroughly investigated Mo Xingdao's background, subtly maneuvering him into revealing many of his techniques.</p><p>Su Zinan knew Mo Xingdao certainly had life-saving trump cards.</p><p>But so what?</p><p>Just look at Mo Xingdao's current opponents: two Daoist True Persons wielding profound esoteric techniques, and the Venom King whose poison skills were unmatched.  As for the Fire Devil, his focus was likely on the Fire Rhinoceros Horn, not entirely on Mo Xingdao.</p><p>However, these three were enough to put Mo Xingdao between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>The female demonic cultivator had meticulously crafted this trap for Mo Xingdao.  How could she miss this opportunity?  Able to manipulate the Emperor Bestowal Mountain's divine restrictions, she was even more dangerous than a true Grand Cultivator.</p><p>Caught in this predicament, it was practically a death trap. Any trump card should have been revealed.</p><p>Su Zinan had to act, or the prey would be snatched by the female demonic cultivator.  Capturing Mo Xingdao's Nascent Soul would complete the three souls.  As long as no Deity Transformation experts interfered, he could do as he pleased.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when Mo Xingdao finally revealed his trump card, it far surpassed everyone's imagination, shocking them all.</p><p>A Nascent Soul late-stage puppet!</p><p>At this moment, the events on the battlefield replayed in everyone's minds.</p><p>True Person Zilei's thunder seal, the torrential flood originating from True Person Hegao's palm, and the Venom King's poisonous sand laced with miasma – these three attacks, each possessing terrifying power, struck a protective barrier almost simultaneously.</p><p>Su Zinan recognized it. To be precise, it wasn't a barrier, but a veil woven from countless threads of light, a defensive magical treasure Mo Xingdao had kept well hidden, only revealing it during his forceful entry into the Illusory Palace.</p><p>He had ordered the Nether Moon Guard to investigate secretly and finally discovered this treasure was called the Primordial Heart Barrier, capable of autonomous defense.  It had belonged to a Northern Wastelands demonic cultivator who had fallen from the Buddhist path two thousand years ago.  From this, he had traced Mo Xingdao's origins.</p><p>Although powerful, this treasure was insufficient to withstand such an onslaught.</p><p>As the Primordial Heart Barrier shattered, the female demonic cultivator, Kundao, suddenly appeared.</p><p>Her timing was impeccable.  The Venom King and the others became her unwitting accomplices.  With a flick of her delicate wrist, a stream of white vital energy descended from the sky, forming a waterfall amidst the grey wind煞, converging in her hand.  She had clearly drawn upon the power of the boundary itself.</p><p>Her five fingers formed a claw, like the giant claw of a celestial dragon, its momentum earth-shattering, piercing through all obstacles.</p><p>Kundao's almond-shaped eyes widened, her gaze filled with eagerness and excitement.</p><p>The next moment, another grayish-black barrier rose. Kundao's five fingers slammed down, combined with the residual power of the thunder seal, the jade smoke torrent, and the poisonous sand, instantly shattering this barrier as well.</p><p>At that very moment,诡异 fluctuations appeared in the void on either side of Mo Xingdao.  Two demonic figures darted out, charging into the shattered barrier fragments alongside Kundao, vying for their prey.</p><p>The metallic clang resonated then.</p><p>The spectacle briefly subsided.</p><p>Everyone saw a tall, robust, dark-skinned figure replacing Mo Xingdao's original position, or rather, shielding him.</p><p>The dark-skinned figure stood three zhang tall, its body forged from spiritual metal and profound iron. Its skin emanated a heavy luster, resembling a legendary golden armored warrior, extraordinarily imposing.</p><p>The luster on its body was identical to the previous barrier.  With arms crossed, it not only blocked Kundao's sneak attack, but also Old Devil Wu's demonic blade and Yanshan's demonic soul's Primordial Heavy Water, which all bombarded its body.</p><p>For a moment, one side of the dark-skinned figure was engulfed in bloody energy, while the other was covered in thick profound ice.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The dark-skinned figure's body was as hard as steel, yet several terrifying wounds appeared on it.</p><p>One could only imagine the fate of a cultivator in its place.</p><p>But it was a puppet.  Although its body became somewhat stiff, as long as its core wasn't destroyed, no matter how many wounds it sustained, it wouldn't disintegrate.  It stumbled back to dissipate the force, revealing Mo Xingdao behind it, completely unharmed.</p><p>The female demonic cultivator's sneak attack failed again.  Even more frustrated than Su Zinan, she almost coughed up blood.</p><p>This fellow was even more troublesome than the old monk.  She had at least injured the old monk before, but now she hadn't even touched a hair on Mo Xingdao, all her attacks landing on the puppet.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Thunder rumbled overhead.</p><p>Simultaneously, a strange sound echoed within her mind.</p><p>Kundao jolted awake.  It was aimed at her again.</p><p>She knew her situation well.  Another failure would make things even more difficult.</p><p>These people were very interested in her, and they might very well launch another siege like before. This place was different from the Five Elements Divine Restriction.  She was constrained here and absolutely couldn't be careless.</p><p>Before the thunder could descend, Kundao's figure blurred, about to vanish.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>He had used the Soul-Seizing Mantra in conjunction with the  Slave-Binding Thunder Technique. His opponent was prepared, and the Soul-Seizing Mantra's power had greatly diminished as expected, but he hadn't anticipated it having seemingly no effect on Kundao at all.</p><p>This woman's strength seemed far greater than he had estimated.</p><p>In a flash of thought, Qin Sang had no intention of giving up. The sword's hum and the thunder resonated together, shaking the surroundings. Sword energy transformed into a rainbow, piercing through the air towards the battlefield, manifesting a sword formation.</p><p>Instantly, heaven and earth darkened, countless sword threads encircling Kundao.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Kundao was even more decisive than before.  After a single strike, without hesitation, she connected with the boundary before the sword formation fully formed.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened slightly. Not intending to achieve complete victory in one stroke, he immediately changed tactics.  The sword formation abruptly contracted, sword intent converging into a single beam, concealing the spiritual sword within, piercing towards Kundao's chest.</p><p>He had the Fire Jade Centipede and wasn't afraid of losing track of Kundao, but this opportunity to weaken her couldn't be missed.</p><p>Kundao was quite formidable, her reaction swift.  She forcefully twisted her mostly ethereal body.  Just then, a majestic shout rang out beside her ear.</p><p>“Who are you, vile creature!”</p><p>The speaker was True Person Zilei.</p><p>This wasn't a soul-attacking technique like the Soul-Seizing Mantra, but it triggered a strong sense of alarm within Kundao.</p><p>Amidst these sudden changes, Su Zinan's plan failed, his mind shaken.  Mo Xingdao was preoccupied with his own survival.  True Person Hegao was astonished by Kundao's sudden appearance.</p><p>The Venom King, having fewer entanglements with the other parties, reacted faster. Seeing the immortal fruit was an illusion and Kundao appearing, he shifted his poisonous sand's target, but it seemed he wouldn't make it in time.</p><p>Only True Person Zilei remained unaffected by the outward appearances.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>His shout boomed like thunder, also like sword energy ripping through the sky.</p><p>The void around Kundao instantly shattered.</p><p>In everyone's eyes, the void shattered like a broken mirror.</p><p>In reality, it wasn't quite like that. Those cracks were bolts of lightning, weaving a net in the void, appearing as if they were slicing the void open.</p><p>These lightning bolts were sharper than true celestial lightning.  Judging by their sharpness, they were clearly strands of sword energy.</p><p>Lightning as skin, sword intent as bone!</p><p>True Person Zilei didn't use a sword; his every flick of a finger was a sword.</p><p>This was the Eight Sceneries View's true inheritance, the *Six Laws of Seizure and Slaughter*. It was both a thunder technique and sword art, a supreme true method.  The Eight Sceneries View only obtained partial fragments, comprehending a single technique from it. Yet, in the art of attack and kill, it could rival all others.</p><p>Wielded by True Person Zilei, its power was unmatched.</p><p>Two Grand Cultivators, two top-tier sword arts, both aimed at Kundao.</p><p>Sword intent instantly soared around Kundao.</p><p>“Tzzz!”</p><p>A series of ripping sounds came, a mixture of the air tearing and sword energy slicing through Kundao's skin and flesh.</p><p>A spray of blood bloomed in the void.</p><p>Kundao vanished.</p><p>The sword intent shifted downwards.</p><p>The Gold Sinking Sword hung in the void, its tip trembling.</p><p>True Person Zilei's five fingers closed, lightning converging into his palm like rivers flowing into the sea, contained but not released.</p><p>The two tacitly withdrew their sword intent, avoiding unnecessary conflict.</p><p>Within that small space, two types of sword intent mingled. Fortunately, they had Kundao as a common target; otherwise, they would have directly clashed, unable to coexist.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his gaze. He and True Person Zilei had unintentionally coordinated, but they still missed, only injuring Kundao without capturing her.</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt this outcome was acceptable.</p><p>On the one hand, he had tested Kundao's limits; on the mountain, she was indeed vastly different than within the Five Elements Divine Restriction.</p><p>On the other hand, if Kundao had truly been captured, it was uncertain who would claim her. Even if she wasn't monopolized by the Daoist sects, the spoils would have to be shared among all parties.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Gold Sinking Sword shot back.  Qin Sang was about to retreat and track Kundao when he heard Mo Xingdao let out a long howl, chuckling coldly, “Someone warned me earlier that allying with Fellow Daoist Su was like sleeping with a tiger, to beware of having my soul extracted and refined into a demonic banner. I still thought it was alarmist talk!”</p><p>Just now, Kundao had been focused on escaping, and Su Zinan had launched a few more attacks, wanting to seize the momentum and take down Mo Xingdao.</p><p>With their faces now revealed, there was no room for reconciliation.</p><p>Unfortunately, although the puppet had suffered heavy damage, its core was untouched, and its strength remained. Coupled with Mo Xingdao, they were equivalent to two Grand Cultivators.</p><p>He, along with the demonic souls, might be able to defeat Mo Xingdao, but that was the limit.</p><p>Hearing Mo Xingdao's words, Su Zinan's face twitched, seemingly remembering something. His gaze turned icy cold.  “That bitch isn't dead!”</p><p>Only Yuefei and Old Wu knew about the Three Corpse Demonic Banner.</p><p>And even they didn't know everything.</p><p>Old Wu only knew the banner could absorb demonic souls up to Nascent Soul mid-stage peak.</p><p>After all, controlling three Grand Cultivators of the same rank with a single demonic banner was simply too shocking.</p><p>One must know that before Old Devil Lu's modifications, the original banner could only control Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivators, and its owner at the time had been besieged by the Buddhist, Daoist, and Demonic factions.</p><p>Of course, that person also didn't have a Deity Transformation foster father.</p><p>But his Three Corpse Demonic Banner was even more potent.</p><p>This banner defied the natural order. Those controlled by it yearned for death but couldn't obtain it, enduring endless torment.</p><p>Once exposed, even Old Wu would be wary of him. The Grand Cultivators of the cultivation world would be in constant fear, quickly forming an anti-Su alliance. Even with his foster father's prestige, he would be forced to retreat to Deer Field, unable to roam freely.</p><p>Old Wu had died by his hand.</p><p>But Yuefei had died elsewhere.  He had only seen her brand disappear, and combined with Old Wu's report, he hadn't investigated further.</p><p>If Mo Xingdao's words were true, it could only have been Yuefei's warning.</p><p>Although Su Zinan hadn't revealed the true secrets to Yuefei, treating her as a plaything, he hadn't been overly cautious either. With the demonic banner nearing completion, in his moment of complacency, during their intimate moments, he might have let slip a few words.</p><p>Later, when Old Wu suddenly disappeared, although he had shifted the blame onto the Fire Devil, Yuefei had been a witness to the Snow Plain battle.</p><p>If she had been inclined to investigate him, she could have connected the dots.</p><p>That bitch, using some unknown method, had broken free from the Nether Moon Seal's control and double-crossed him!</p><p>Mo Xingdao chuckled coldly without responding.</p><p>He had long known Su Zinan harbored ulterior motives, yet he still journeyed with him. Naturally, he had the confidence to swallow the bait and emerge unscathed.</p><p>For ordinary matters, he would put in the effort, not letting Su Zinan see through him.</p><p>But for matters like pursuing the Fire Devil, he would only go through the motions.</p><p>In matters of men and women, Su Zinan had always been the one in control, Yuefei and the others his caged songbirds.  Unexpectedly, he had been viciously pecked.  He was instantly enraged.</p><p>His demonic souls had been exposed before the Daoist True Persons, but the demonic banner was concealed within his sleeve.  If Mo Xingdao hadn't revealed it, he might have been able to feign ignorance.  Now, it was impossible.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>True Person Hegao, recovering from the series of surprising events, immediately looked at Su Zinan, his tone chilling, “Wretch! Old Devil Lu isn't in this realm, yet you dare to act so brazenly!”</p><p>Su Zinan recalled the demonic souls, sneering, “With your actions today, what right do you have to reprimand me?”</p><p>True Person Hegao was momentarily speechless.</p><p>The Eight Sceneries View had allowed the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect to open the legacy grounds. No matter how one looked at it, it wasn't above reproach.  In the future, if other factions pursued the matter, with a Deity Transformation expert present, they would be fine. Otherwise, they would be too preoccupied with their own affairs to care about Su Zinan.</p><p>He couldn't help but turn to his sect leader senior brother. This matter was truly difficult to resolve.</p><p>True Person Zilei remained silent, seemingly sensing something.</p><p>Everyone assumed he was searching for Kundao's trail.</p><p>A moment later, a stream of light suddenly flew out from True Person Zilei's crown. Within the light, an eight-sided palace lantern slowly rose, gently rotating.</p><p>Seeing this lantern, Su Zinan's sneer vanished.  Mo Xingdao leaped onto the puppet's shoulder, both on guard.</p><p>The Venom King exclaimed softly, "The Eight Sceneries Palace Lantern!"</p><p>Suddenly, the lantern blazed brightly, rainbow light illuminating heaven and earth. A bridge of rainbow light extended, pointing directly towards a certain spot on the summit of Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Where the rainbow bridge reached, the wind煞 subsided, and the formation restrictions solidified.</p><p>True Person Zilei stepped onto the rainbow bridge, resembling a celestial immortal.</p>
