<h1>Chapter 2066: Chaotic Devil Cudgel Technique</h1><p>Yuan Miao asked with a solemn expression, “May I ask how I should address Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>“My surname is Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p>“So it's Fellow Daoist Qin,” Yuan Miao nodded, raising a hand and pointing towards the horizon. “This is not a suitable place for combat. Please follow me.”</p><p>With that, Yuan Miao soared into the sky, his body like a shooting star, piercing the heavens. Qin Sang and the other two followed closely behind.</p><p>The Zhuyan expert who had clashed with Ji Hong couldn't contain himself, scratching the back of his head.  He threw down the words, "You all stay guard here," and hurriedly chased after them.</p><p>A battle between experts held an unparalleled allure for every member of the Zhuyan Clan. The remaining clansmen were itching to watch, but fortunately, their reason prevailed, and they knew their duty lay in guarding the area.</p><p>Yuan Miao led the group towards the outer reaches of the sky.</p><p>Along the way, Si Lu suddenly remembered something and transmitted his voice, "This is merely a friendly spar between two individuals. Let's not disturb the other Fellow Daoists."</p><p>If news of this battle were to leak out, it would undoubtedly cause a huge uproar throughout the entire Zhuyan Clan. The resulting spectacle would be far grander than they desired.</p><p>Yuan Miao grunted, somewhat reluctant. The Zhuyan Clan were a warlike people, adept at gleaning experience from combat.  The chance to observe a clash between experts would be a rare opportunity for the younger generation of the clan.</p><p>Even if Yuan Miao were to lose in front of the entire clan, he wouldn't consider it a loss of face. It would merely mean his skills were inferior. He could simply return and diligently cultivate, then challenge again later!</p><p>However, since his guest had made the request, he couldn't very well refuse. He cast a spell to conceal the group's aura fluctuations.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others flew through the sky, the landscape flowing beneath them.</p><p>The Teleportation Formation was located here, indicating this area must be a pivotal location for the Zhuyan Clan.  Unexpectedly, the Zhuyan Clan hadn't constructed a magnificent immortal city here like other foreign clans.</p><p>The surroundings were a scene of natural beauty.  Countless oddly shaped mountain peaks stood tall upon the earth, rivers flowed ceaselessly, and forests thrived lushly.</p><p>The Zhuyan clansmen lived within these mountains and wilds. Occasionally, figures could be seen emerging from beneath the tree canopy, while many others traversed and leaped amongst the treetops and vines, using them as pathways.</p><p>Even the ordinary members of the Zhuyan Clan were strong and vigorous, agile and nimble, capable of wrestling tigers and leopards.</p><p>However, they weren't savage beasts who drank blood and wore furs. They also constructed exquisite dwellings and possessed intelligence no less than that of the human race. It was simply that they were innately close to nature, their daily lives completely integrated with the natural world.</p><p>Besides the Zhuyan Clan, Qin Sang also saw other foreign clans.</p><p>It was normal to see other Imperial Clans within Zhuyan territory. However, Qin Sang noticed one particular foreign clan whose numbers were exceptionally high.  From what he could see, their numbers were only slightly fewer than the Zhuyan Clan themselves.</p><p>This clan had slender limbs and fair skin. Their facial features were somewhat unique, with abundant hair on their cheeks and two distinct markings beneath their eyelids, giving the impression they were perpetually smiling.  They also spoke in soft, gentle voices.</p><p>Compared to the Zhuyan Clan, with their wide, staring eyes and eagerness for a fight, they appeared far more amiable.</p><p>He couldn't help but wonder which clan this was and how the Zhuyan Clan could tolerate so many of them within their territory.</p><p>“That’s the Youying Clan,” Ji Hong’s voice transmitted. “Although they’re not a Superior Clan, they are said to be quite powerful. There are even rumors they are on equal footing with the Zhuyan Clan, simply with different roles, jointly ruling the other Imperial Clans. Of course, outsiders can't know the inner workings. The Zhuyan Clan has always been the dominant force, so the Youying Clan shouldn’t be able to challenge their position yet.”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in acknowledgement, committing this information to memory.  The Youying Clan held such a high position, so he would definitely have to interact with them in the future when he established his Daoist temple here.</p><p>As they spoke, Yuan Miao slowed his speed ahead, leading the group down towards an isolated peak that stood out like a crane among chickens.</p><p>The peak’s four sides were nearly sheer cliffs.  Its summit had been leveled into a flat stone platform, square and spacious, forming an excellent battle arena.</p><p>Such arenas were common in this area.  Almost every mountaintop had been flattened and transformed into stone platforms of varying sizes.  As they flew, they had seen people sparring on most of these platforms, both cultivators and mortals, with numerous onlookers and constant cheers.</p><p>It seemed the Zhuyan Clan's reputation for being warlike was truly well-deserved!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Yuan Miao landed, striking out with a jade talisman. He then stomped his foot heavily, and the platform trembled slightly. Crimson light rose from the four sides, eventually transforming into a light curtain. Within the curtain, countless threads of light crisscrossed, forming a smooth light net that enveloped the entire platform.</p><p>Simultaneously, shimmering light flowed across the surface of the net, concealing all unusual phenomena within, making it impossible to see from the outside.</p><p>Yuan Miao turned to explain to Qin Sang, “Don’t worry, Fellow Daoist Qin. This formation is only to prevent stray energy from leaking out and causing damage. It won't affect our spar in any way. Our clan has no such rules in combat. If one feels they are outmatched, they simply declare defeat aloud. Otherwise, being beaten to death or crippled is their own fault. Additionally, since this is a spar and not a death match, stepping off the platform constitutes defeat. However, if Fellow Daoist Qin deliberately avoids fighting, that is not what this old man wants to see!”</p><p>Pausing, Yuan Miao suddenly erupted with a boundless battle intent.  “I hope Fellow Daoist Qin will display your true abilities and not hold back!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t reply, but his own aura erupted simultaneously. The two auras clashed like two azure dragons in the sky, instantly darkening the heavens and earth, sending flying sand and rocks swirling, while the void rumbled like thunder.</p><p>The formation here was clearly extremely robust.  Despite enduring such a collision, the light net and the earth remained unmoved.</p><p>Si Lu and the others flashed over to the viewing platform beside the arena.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at Yuan Miao, seeing his eyes were crimson red and his gaze incredibly fierce.  He now gave off the impression of a ferocious beast, but his reason remained completely unaffected, making him even more formidable than a beast.</p><p>A flash of purple light appeared in Yuan Miao’s right hand as he grasped a purple-gold cudgel.</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed that the Zhuyan Clan, whether mortal or cultivator, favored weapons like cudgels, staffs, and heavy blades, with cudgels being the most common.  He guessed this was because such weapons allowed them to fully unleash their strength.</p><p>The tip of the cudgel touched the ground with a *dong*, and a purple-gold halo rippled outwards. Yuan Miao's entire body instantly appeared as if cast from gold and iron!</p><p>Sensing Yuan Miao's increasingly powerful aura, Qin Sang exhaled softly, summoning his spirit tablet and gripping it tightly with his five fingers.</p><p>At the same time, he silently circulated his cultivation technique, the *Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art*, summoning his Dharma Idol. He felt a boundless, irresistible power surge into his flesh and bones, filling his entire body with limitless strength.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Bright Mountain Armor manifested on his body. This treasure, having been refined again by him, now possessed the might of a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Yuan Miao narrowed his eyes.  Having cultivated through countless battles, he keenly sensed the change in Qin Sang, feeling a sense of oppression. However, the stronger his opponent, the more it ignited his fighting spirit. He let out a low growl, his right hand suddenly tightening its grip.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang’s vision seemed to be filled with nothing but a streak of purple-gold light, a cudgel shadow rapidly enlarging before his eyes.</p><p>This first strike was merely a probe, yet its power was not to be underestimated. Qin Sang’s eyes flashed. He remained where he was, his arm raising slightly.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A bizarrely static scene appeared on the platform. Qin Sang stood in place, his feet slightly apart, holding the spirit tablet aloft. Yuan Miao appeared above Qin Sang, both hands gripping the purple-gold cudgel as he brought it down, smashing it against the spirit tablet.</p><p>The first strike seemed to end in a stalemate.</p><p>Almost as soon as Yuan Miao materialized, his figure not yet dissipated, another Yuan Miao appeared behind Qin Sang, the purple-gold cudgel fiercely smashing towards the back of his head.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unflustered, once again wielding the spirit tablet to block.</p><p>A continuous rumble echoed across the platform. Qin Sang’s legs seemed rooted to the ground, not moving an inch, while figures of Yuan Miao flickered above him ceaselessly. In the blink of an eye, dozens, then hundreds appeared, their figures overlapping, creating a hazy illusion.</p><p>It appeared as though Qin Sang was simultaneously under siege by countless Yuan Miaos. The spirit tablet in his hand flitted like a butterfly, firmly blocking every cudgel strike.</p><p>Qin Sang rarely encountered this kind of close-quarters combat. His Dharma Body cultivation was higher, and his physical strength was mostly used to supplement his techniques or mislead his opponents' judgment.</p><p>However, thanks to his past cultivation of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, which granted him near-instinctive, acute perception, his combat abilities were by no means lacking.  His defense was airtight, leaving Yuan Miao unable to find an opening.</p><p>Despite this, Qin Sang only defended, not attacking, appearing to be at a disadvantage. Yuan Miao’s assault was like a raging storm, seemingly about to engulf him at any moment.</p><p>Ji Hong, watching the battle, couldn’t help but become tense. Si Lu, however, remained calm and composed, full of confidence in Qin Sang.</p><p>Unable to break through Qin Sang's defense after a prolonged assault, Yuan Miao suddenly shouted, “Fellow Daoist, why not reveal your true abilities?”</p><p>In the next moment, the illusory figures shattered simultaneously, leaving only a single cudgel shadow between heaven and earth - the true form of the purple-gold cudgel.</p><p>This strike seemed to have fused the power of countless Yuan Miaos, as if it had accumulated and intensified continuously, its momentum reaching its peak, finally erupting at this moment!</p><p>“Take this!”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt a sharp pain at the crown of his head, a warning sign arising in his heart. Recognizing the power of this strike, he immediately changed his mind.  No longer hesitating, he truly activated the Great Vajra Wheel Seal. In an instant, his body, inside and out, became clear and translucent, manifesting the Vajra琉璃 Body.</p><p>Then, a beam of azure light shot towards the sky, bravely colliding with the purple-gold cudgel, fearless and indomitable!</p><p>The next moment, azure and gold shockwaves erupted, a majestic force surging skyward, seemingly about to tear open the heavens themselves.  Fortunately, it was blocked by the light net.</p><p>Amidst the shockwaves, Qin Sang and Yuan Miao were both sent flying backwards simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly stepped on the void, forcibly stabilizing his figure. Looking up, he saw Yuan Miao's purple-gold cudgel dragging along the ground, leaving a distinct white mark as he too regained his footing.</p><p>“What strength!”</p><p>Yuan Miao’s eyes gleamed as he let out a loud roar towards the sky, a roar of pure exhilaration.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze narrowed. He saw Yuan Miao’s skin become increasingly crimson, as if blood were seeping out from within.  Then, bloody light steamed from his body, like blood flames burning around him.</p><p>The instant the blood flames appeared, Yuan Miao’s aura surged once more.  This sight made one wonder if Yuan Miao was burning his life essence to gain immense power.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled what Ji Hong had said earlier and realized the Zhuyan Clan's divine abilities resided within their vigorous blood essence.  This wasn’t Yuan Miao burning his life essence, but rather him unleashing his divine abilities, seeing that ordinary methods were ineffective against him.</p><p>In common understanding, this could be considered burning life essence, but not only would Yuan Miao not become weakened, he would grow even stronger as the battle progressed!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly felt his vision turn completely crimson. He sensed an even more astonishing power than before.  His expression remained calm as he used the Great Vajra Wheel Seal to mobilize even the most minute amount of power, converging it into a single point.  The spirit tablet in his hand slammed outwards.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>This time, the formation on the platform was actually shaken by their clash, the ground trembling.</p><p>The two instantly became locked in combat, entangled together. Observers could no longer distinguish between Qin Sang and Yuan Miao's figures.</p><p>Ji Hong and the Zhuyan expert widened their eyes. All they could see was a chaotic ball of light, flashing from one end of the platform to the other, and back again.  Occasionally, they would glimpse a blurry figure, unable to tell which one it was, or if it was merely an afterimage.</p><p>They tried to activate their spiritual vision to see the battle clearly, but soon felt dizzy and lightheaded.  Only Si Lu could still discern the two’s attacks, secretly marveling at their power, especially Qin Sang's ability to fight on par with a member of the Zhuyan Clan despite his human body!</p><p>Just as Ji Hong and the other expert were becoming disoriented, the two figures abruptly separated, followed by a loud roar.</p><p>“Take my Chaotic Devil Cudgel Technique!”</p><p>Ji Hong and the Zhuyan expert stared wide-eyed. They saw a crimson devil cudgel smashing down towards Qin Sang.  This strike was terrifyingly powerful, capable of piercing the heavens.  Even on the viewing platform, they felt their hearts pounding violently, as if they would be crushed into pulp beneath this single blow.</p><p>It was difficult to imagine the immense pressure Qin Sang faced, directly confronting the crimson devil cudgel.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang’s expression also turned serious.  He certainly wouldn’t be defeated by a single strike, but he could sense the opponent's cudgel technique was extremely profound. Even if he blocked this strike, more ferocious attacks would inevitably follow.  Once the opponent’s offensive unfolded, he would be forced to constantly defend, without a moment to breathe.</p><p>Yuan Miao seemed to have entered some kind of peculiar state, his eyes focused solely on his opponent, forgetting himself, willing even to trade injuries.</p><p>A head-on clash wasn’t what Qin Sang wanted. Even if he defeated Yuan Miao, the result would likely be damage to his Bright Mountain Armor, or even injuries to himself.  Yuan Miao didn't care, but he didn't want to be injured here for no reason.</p><p>“Truly berserk.”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered inwardly, immediately moving to block the crimson devil cudgel.  As expected, the strikes came faster and faster.</p><p>His figure vanished within the flurry of cudgel shadows.  Unhurried, he waited for the opportune moment.  Azure light erupted from his back, accompanied by flashes of lightning, as a pair of phoenix wings manifested.</p><p>Then, he channeled the Azure Phoenix True Lightning into the phoenix wings. A flash of lightning later, he appeared at the edge of the platform.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The crimson devil cudgel smashed down onto an afterimage, striking nothing but air.</p><p>Yuan Miao couldn't help but pause, stunned.  He had never encountered such a situation before. Once he unleashed the Chaotic Devil Cudgel Technique and gained a certain advantage, his opponents were usually left with no choice but to defend.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang had managed to escape the cage formed by the Chaotic Devil Cudgel Technique purely through speed.  He had encountered all kinds of opponents and witnessed all sorts of countermeasures, but Qin Sang was the first to directly escape from beneath his devil cudgel.</p><p>His gaze shifted towards the phoenix wings on Qin Sang’s back.  They weren’t a magical treasure or a divine ability, but truly grew from his body.</p><p>“Feathered Clan?”</p><p>This thought flashed through Yuan Miao's mind. He recalled the Feathered Clan and the various Imperial Clans under their rule, but none possessed such wings. However, he had heard the Feathered Clan and their subordinate clans were quite liberal, not strictly prohibiting interbreeding, so the appearance of any kind of individual wasn’t surprising.</p><p>The battle hadn't ended yet.  Yuan Miao quickly gathered his thoughts.  Even though his opponent’s speed was great, he wasn't without recourse.</p><p>After all, this was an arena!</p><p>However, Qin Sang suddenly flashed a smile at him. “Now, it’s my turn to attack!”</p>
