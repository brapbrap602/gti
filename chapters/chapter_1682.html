<h1>Chapter 1673: Realm Shatters</h1><p>In the medicinal garden.</p><p>Du Wang and Qin Sang were in hot pursuit, while He Gao Zhenren, unexpectedly, didn't leave with Zi Lei Zhenren but continued deeper into the garden.</p><p>Su Zi Nan also chose to stay.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao was faster, already frantically searching the garden.</p><p>While vast, the garden's medicinal herbs were limited.  Firstly, these herbs are delicate and demanding, with different herbs prone to conflict.  Complex formations and restrictions are needed to alter the environment to meet their growth needs, often requiring large spaces.  Secondly, those selected for Di Shou Mountain were extremely valuable or rare, types not abundant even within Wu Xiang Xianmen.  Thirdly, during the Demon Calamity, most were used in alchemy to support the battlefield, leaving very few.</p><p>Of course, the herbs were secondary; both men were also observing He Gao Zhenren's movements.  Despite their feud, Mo Xing Dao and Su Zi Nan managed to maintain a fragile truce.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren remained at the forefront.  He moved through the garden, his discerning eye, honed by his prestigious sect background, only occasionally stopping to break a formation for a herb that interested him.  He effectively circled the entire garden.</p><p>He seemed oblivious to the two others who kept a watchful distance.</p><p>Gradually, Su Zi Nan and Mo Xing Dao grew suspicious, wondering if He Gao Zhenren was deliberately leading them in circles.</p><p>They were not only tracking him but also observing the formations and sensing the area's energy, yet found nothing unusual.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao was content with whatever herbs he found.</p><p>Su Zi Nan, however, regretted abandoning the chance to fish in troubled waters with Du Wang and the Fire Demon, though his soul-collecting banner's purpose was exposed, making further attempts difficult. This frustration was growing.</p><p>Looking towards the mountaintop, Su Zi Nan thought of Zi Lei Zhenren, wondering if He Gao Zhenren was feigning interest, keeping everyone occupied to prevent anyone from confronting Zi Lei Zhenren.  The treasure was actually at the summit!</p><p>But what were Fan Lao Mo and the other Demon Elders doing?</p><p>The situation was chaotic; who could know the full picture?</p><p>Su Zi Nan, giving up, leaped hundreds of meters, crossing the formations to approach He Gao Zhenren, asking directly, "What are you searching for, Zhenren?"</p><p>He Gao Zhenren, seemingly noticing him for the first time, glanced indifferently, "I am collecting herbs to replenish my own garden.  What concern is it of yours?  Have you been tracking me because you covet my Nascent Soul?"</p><p>His tone was dripping with sarcasm and devoid of any politeness.</p><p>With two souls bound to his banner, and Mo Xing Dao and his late-stage Nascent Soul puppet watching from a distance, Su Zi Nan needed to tread carefully. While wary of He Gao Zhenren, he wouldn't be overly intimidated.</p><p>Su Zi Nan's face twitched.  Before he could reply, a furious roar echoed.</p><p>The roar reverberated across Di Shou Mountain, audible even in the garden.</p><p>All three were stunned.</p><p>As Su Zi Nan searched for the roar's origin, he sensed something amiss.  A deafening crane cry pierced the air, and He Gao Zhenren transformed into a crane, plunging into a formation.  The formation's five elemental energies were unbalanced, with earth element being prominent, with perpetual swirling sand. This suggested the type of herb cultivated here; however, the formation was empty.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>He Gao Zhenren, using some unknown ability, slightly paused on impact, then effortlessly entered.</p><p>When Su Zi Nan and Mo Xing Dao arrived, they saw only swirling sand, a hazy crane shadow fleeting across the yellow expanse.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Su Zi Nan and Mo Xing Dao attacked simultaneously.</p><p>The attacks from the banner's main soul and the puppet, combined with their true forms, were comparable to the combined might of five late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The formation's barrier groaned under the strain, collapsing. The violent sandstorm was blown open, revealing the faint crane shadow deep within.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, they exchanged a glance.</p><p>Their unresolvable hatred now forced them into uneasy cooperation—a bitter irony.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the seal.</p><p>Fan Lao Mo unleashed the Foul Yin Phosphorus Sand, aware of his grave mistake.</p><p>The five-colored crown's glow dimmed, the black tide surging, changing direction towards him.  Terrified, he retreated into the lotus heart as his phantom body dissipated into smoke.</p><p>The ethereal lotus recoiled, vanishing into the ancient mirror.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The black tide followed instantly, engulfing the mirror.</p><p>The mirror trembled violently.  A brilliant light erupted from its center, cracking it open. The black tide surged into the fissure, threatening to overwhelm it.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The mirror shattered, its fragments dissolving like a dream.</p><p>The black tide, now more turbulent, searched frantically but found nothing.  Its resentful energy coalesced, then violently struck the five-colored crown.</p><p>Outside the seal…</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren manifested his thunder deity form, wielding lightning at will.</p><p>The raging purple lightning was in his hands like chains of divine punishment.  He became the thunder deity, enacting heavenly retribution!</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren looked down at Zhu Wu Dao, his presence like a mountain, a thunderous abyss.  He raised his hand, and lightning rained down, shattering Zhu Wu Dao’s sword into fragments.</p><p>The purple-eyed demonic eye, following the sword's destruction, was Zhu Wu Dao's true killing blow.</p><p>But lightning inherently possesses the power to vanquish evil.  In his thunder deity form, clad in thunder robes and an imperial crown, surrounded by swirling purple lightning, Zi Lei Zhenren was impervious.</p><p>The purple-eyed demonic eye, already distanced by the intervention of the demonic child and further hampered, was significantly weakened. It was powerless against Zi Lei Zhenren’s steeled resolve.</p><p>Despite the demonic child's aid, Zhu Wu Dao was shaken, his scalp tingling from the overwhelming aura above. He abandoned his spirit sword, retracting the purple eye, and silently chanted a mantra.</p><p>His brow split open, releasing a black gleam, like a third demonic eye.</p><p>*Whizz!*</p><p>The black gleam vanished.</p><p>It reappeared inside the palace lantern's illusory scene, transformed into a small black demonic blade.  Compared to the torrential purple lightning, it seemed insignificant, its power faint.</p><p>In reality, this was a manifestation of power refined to its utmost limit. Wherever the demonic blade passed, the illusory stars and heavens collapsed into chaos. The eight-scene palace lantern spun wildly, desperately casting flickers of light to repair the illusion, but it could not stop the blade.</p><p>In an instant, only lightning separated Zi Lei Zhenren and the demonic blade.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren, unflinching, condensed purple light before him.  This thunder seal was unlike the previous ones; its runes were far more complex, forged this time by the imperial crown.</p><p>The thunder seal descended, drawing the surrounding lightning towards it, expanding several times in an instant. The gigantic seal met the demonic blade head-on, perfectly aligned.</p><p>It wasn't that Zhu Wu Dao couldn't alter the blade's course, but he had no chance!</p><p>The thunder seal and demonic blade collided, both disintegrating.</p><p>The next moment, the two immense forces fused into a swirling mass of purple and black light, lasting only a brief instant before exploding with a deafening roar that echoed through the mountain.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren, anticipating this, had already retracted the palace lantern's illusion, avoiding the blast's impact. Simultaneously, he gently stroked his imperial crown, drawing the purple lightning into the illusion.</p><p>The illusion shifted rapidly.</p><p>When Zhu Wu Dao reacted, he was surrounded by ubiquitous lightning.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's eyebrows twitched.  While he anticipated Zi Lei Zhenren’s formidable abilities guarding the first gate, he hadn't expected such overwhelming power. Even with the demonic child's aid, he couldn't gain the upper hand.</p><p>Thankfully, the demonic blade had bought time.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao, working secretly, had finally completed his spirit array. With a flick of his wrist, he launched a statue into the array's center, where it sat upright.</p><p>The statue was blood-red, strikingly eerie.</p><p>As the array completed, the external blood sacrifice reached its peak.  Thick blood energy seemed to seep from the statue, yet its eyes were dyed black.</p><p>At that moment, the lifeless statue blinked. Two black eyes shot towards Zhu Wu Dao, transferring immense power into him.</p><p>Cracking sounds echoed—the sound of Zhu Wu Dao's bones breaking and his golden armor twisting.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao spread his arms, his hair flying wildly, demonic energy surging.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren sensed a deadly threat, his expression changing.</p><p>Then, doubt arose within Zhu Wu Dao, for the demonic child’s power was far stronger than anticipated.  While the passage was open, the demonic child still needed time to fully escape, a slow transfer of power.</p><p>Communicating mentally with the demonic child, Zhu Wu Dao quickly understood. He chuckled.</p><p>"Thanks to Brother Fan," he murmured.</p><p>This unexpected turn would make the situation far better!</p><p>At that moment, a pained groan echoed from the mountaintop, followed by a falling figure.</p><p>Old Demon Fan, evading the black tide, had decisively shattered the mirror projection and hastily retreated. The mirror talisman before him violently shook, nearly shattering.</p><p>His phantom body, also affected, was forcibly ejected from the mirror talisman, revealing his true form and suffering injuries.</p><p>With the illusory scene, the changes within the mountain couldn't escape Master Zilei's perception.</p><p>Sensing Master Zilei's sharp gaze, Fan Laomo preemptively shouted, "Old geezer, this is your doing!"</p><p>As soon as the shout rang out, Fan Laomo stopped his descent and turned to flee.</p><p>"Where do you think you're going!"</p><p>Master Zilei coldly snorted.  The Eight景 Palace lantern soared, the illusory scene rapidly expanding. By the time Fan Laomo stabilized his mirror talisman, he was already pulled into the lantern's illusion.</p><p>It wasn't that Master Zilei intended to fight many alone; rather, unforeseen events had unfolded rapidly.  Master Zilei felt an increasingly ominous sense, yet many things remained unclear.</p><p>Fan Laomo's sudden appearance clearly indicated his clandestine involvement.</p><p>Entering the illusion, Fan Laomo saw Zhu Wudao's transformation and, recalling his experience within the seal, pieced together the whole picture, realizing that his junior brother had hidden much more than he'd imagined.</p><p>Fan Laomo sighed, transmitting the truth to Master Zilei via divine sense.</p><p>Instantly, both looked towards the statue in the array!</p><p>Below.</p><p>Regardless of their exchange, Zhu Wudao's sole priority was ensuring the demonic child's escape from the seal, preventing anyone from attacking the statue and disrupting the passage.</p><p>If the opponent were the Saint Sovereign, even a small fraction of his power would make him invincible. As it stood, caution was paramount.</p><p>Otherwise, it would be a case of failing at the last hurdle.</p><p>Zhu Wudao moved slightly, appearing above the statue, blocking the two's line of sight. Demonic energy gathered in his palms, forming two points of support. A dark curtain unfurled above him, concealing everything.</p><p>At that moment, the world's elemental energy subtly fluctuated.</p><p>Similar phenomena occurred during the earlier deployment of the lantern's illusion, followed by the darkening curtain growing thicker.</p><p>Inside the seal.</p><p>The black tide never ceased, wave after wave relentlessly assaulting the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>Although the Five Elements Crown's light dimmed somewhat, supported by the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, it remained stable, unmoving at the heart of the black tide.</p><p>The spirit had detected the 'passage' between the statue and the demonic child.</p><p>But the Five Elements Crown, already tainted and unstable, faced the demonic child's frenzied counterattack, leaving the spirit momentarily helpless. Furthermore, the 'passage' was extremely mysterious, its roots not here, but thousands of miles away, sustained by countless blood-soaked statues continuously channeling power—not easily severed.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>...</p><p>The incessant impacts were accompanied by the demonic child's threats and enticements.</p><p>"You can't devour me!"</p><p>"Why not join forces and corrupt the world?"</p><p>"If we fight, others will profit."</p><p>"Have you forgotten how they enslaved and controlled you? Do you still want to return?"</p><p>"Spirit! Who wouldn't be tempted?"</p><p>"They sealed me with your help; you'll suffer the same fate. They won't give you a chance to regain your true nature! Even if you agree, they'll control you first, setting a trap!"</p><p>"You've dealt with them; they're all cunning and ruthless. Do you think you're their match?"</p><p>"Only I, in desperation, offer you a genuine alliance!"</p><p>"Break the seal, and we'll form a soul contract. I'll transmit the True Spirit Creation Method, allowing you free passage."</p><p>"Otherwise! Once I'm free, I will subdue you!"</p><p>...</p><p>These words pierced the Five Elements Crown, assaulting the spirit's mind.</p><p>The mocking tones ignited the spirit's fury.</p><p>Yet, the spirit couldn't refute them.</p><p>During its time inhabiting the Kun Dao, any other cultivator on the mountain in its position could have exploited the conflicts between others, crafting a more intricate and perilous killing scheme, and taking control. Yet, it had bungled things.</p><p>However, the spirit remained silent, unresponsive, ignoring everything else, focusing on its core. Layers of multicolored radiance rippled outwards, washing away the foul Yin phosphorus sand clinging to the Five Elements Crown, its luster gradually returning.</p><p>As the demonic child continuously assaulted the seal, the flaws in the Seven Mansions Star Field Sword Array were suddenly amplified, swiftly spreading through the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, impacting the seal.</p><p>The Five Elements Cycle still persisted, the Divine Prohibition not collapsing so quickly, but anomalies had begun to appear.</p><p>The first signs appeared in the barrier, which was built on the seal's power, integrating the mountain's other formations. Changes in the seal first manifested here.</p><p>Qin Sang, the Poison King, the three in the medicine garden, and the cultivators outside Mount Disu—</p><p>At this moment, they all saw cracks spreading across the barrier, tainted by the wind煞, like countless pythons, horrifying to behold.</p><p>Amidst it all, Qin Sang and others heard a booming thunder reverberating through Mount Disu, shaking their souls.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to investigate the source of the anomaly, a look of surprise flashed across his face. He raised his left hand, and the blood moon mark faintly glowed, emitting a slight warmth.</p>
