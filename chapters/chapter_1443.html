<h1>Chapter 1435: The Azure Luan Divine Form</h1><p>Chapter 1435: The Azure Luan Divine Form</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's eyes flashed.</p><p>His spiritual sense was unleashed without reservation.</p><p>The gale force winds grew even more violent.  A distinct white current within them differed noticeably from the other winds – this was the manifestation of his spiritual sense, its taking physical form!</p><p>Only with extremely powerful and solidified spiritual sense could one achieve this, a feat considered a hallmark of great cultivators.</p><p>Few cultivators in the mid-Yuan Ying stage could accomplish this; those who could were without exception among the most top-tier experts in the cultivation world.</p><p>“I still can't directly draw upon the world's elemental energy. They say that's a technique only available at the Transformation Deity stage, fundamentally different from the Yuan Ying stage. I was thinking too much,”</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, before returning to the present.</p><p>“Hmm, the benefits of a manifested spiritual sense are very obvious. Besides the inherent advantages, there’s a qualitative leap in the speed of spellcasting and timing. Disguise is harder to penetrate.  And my spiritual perception is much sharper!  For example, my premonition of danger, or when being spied on, is much easier to detect now.”</p><p>Qin Sang now understood why the Hunmo Elder had tracked him for so long without the Sky-Eyed Butterfly noticing until the very last moment.</p><p>He recalled any unusual activity of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly before entering the Jinghai Sect, remembering that inexplicable fluttering of its wings.</p><p>It was most likely caused by the Hunmo Elder.</p><p>It wasn't that the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's innate ability was weak, unable to detect the Hunmo Elder's movements.  Rather, the Hunmo Elder's spiritual perception was too acute; he sensed the anomaly just as he was about to be exposed, reacting immediately.</p><p>And in the Buddhist temple.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder’s reaction was faster than Qin Sang had anticipated. The demonic light he unleashed in haste was even able to disperse the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>“No wonder!”</p><p>Qin Sang understood his previous doubts, nodding slightly, thinking to himself,  “Once the Sky-Eyed Butterfly advances to the mid-fourth transformation, I wonder if it could still hide its presence from a great cultivator?”</p><p>Having finished his analysis, Qin Sang withdrew his spiritual sense.  Immediately, the Fire Lotus Seed flew out from his forehead.</p><p>Qin Sang let it hover in front of him, examining it carefully.</p><p>After refining the Hidden Fragrance Pill and diligently cultivating for four months, Qin Sang successfully broke through to the second level of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique!</p><p>The Fire Lotus Seed's appearance hadn't changed much; there was just a faint flame circling its surface. Upon closer inspection, one could see a faint outline of a flower bud forming.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully recalled.</p><p>Mou Lao Mo's Fire Lotus Seed seemed to have shown this as well, and the flower bud on Mou Lao Mo's Fire Lotus Seed was more fully formed.</p><p>From this, it can be inferred that Mou Lao Mo was at the second level of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, and his attainment was higher than Qin Sang's current level.</p><p>Looking at the unopened Fire Lotus Seed, recalling the description in the secret technique, Qin Sang softly said, “To advance to the third level and evolve the Spirit Fire Lotus Platform, a complete lotus must be condensed.  Judging by this, refining all the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire won't be enough, and it will require a long time of cultivation. To break through to the third level, I'd need to be at the Transformation Deity stage, or perhaps… even higher?”</p><p>What level of secret technique is the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*?</p><p>Qin Sang thought he needed to reassess it.</p><p>The third level of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* was unattainable for now, so Qin Sang stopped thinking about it and instead considered his future refinement of the demonic fire. With his spiritual sense manifested, and thus more substantial, the speed of refinement would naturally increase.</p><p>He released the demonic banner, controlling the demonic fire.  It was indeed much easier to handle, no longer worrying about opponents finding a weakness to escape from.</p><p>He tried using spells, including the *Summoning Thunder Technique*, and found them much easier and faster to perform than before.</p><p>Having verified the transformative effects of his manifested spiritual sense in various ways, Qin Sang was about to return to his cave when he suddenly remembered something. He made a hand gesture, his form shifting.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>His phoenix wings spread wide behind him as Qin Sang used the Celestial Demon Transformation, demonic energy billowing.</p><p>He was about to try the Thunder Escape technique, to see how the manifested spiritual sense affected his wings, when a sudden feeling arose in his heart, and he shouted, “Azure Luan Divine Form!”</p><p>The Azure Luan Divine Form appeared, still exceptionally illusory.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that his *Celestial Demon Transformation* had not progressed much.</p><p>However, summoning the Azure Luan Divine Form this time felt completely different.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time.  With a thought, the Azure Luan Divine Form flickered slightly, and Qin Sang felt the thunder power within his phoenix wings suddenly surge wildly.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A lightning bolt tore through the void, followed by a deafening clap of thunder.</p><p>Before the thunder subsided, another lightning bolt returned along the same path, revealing Qin Sang's slightly excited smile.</p><p>For a time, wind, rain, and lightning alternated in this sea area.</p><p>The sea creatures instinctively feared this, fleeing in all directions.</p><p>“Unexpectedly, the benefits of the manifested spiritual sense aren't limited to that; it can even preliminarily mobilize the power of the Azure Luan Divine Form, enhancing the Thunder Escape technique, making my escape speed even faster!”</p><p>On second thought, this wasn't strange.</p><p>All signs pointed to the importance of mental and physical fortitude for cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang reflected on the performance of the Hun Mo Elder at the Jing Hai Sect, assessing in her heart, "If the Hun Mo Elder hadn't held back, even with my two escape techniques combined, my speed would have surpassed his.  Hmm, the Hun Mo Elder wouldn't have sacrificed reason due to rage. He likely needed to be wary of traps within the secret passage; it wasn't his full strength. This needs further verification. However, with my current strength, even if I encounter that old demon again, I'll be able to hold my own."</p><p>The improvement in her escape techniques was an unexpected bonus, greatly boosting her confidence.</p><p>"With my increased speed and heightened senses, I now have enough confidence to attend the Wan Mo Assembly, even if there are traps. The Hun Mo Elder certainly wouldn't expect me to break through to spiritual sense transformation in such a short time. However, I can't get complacent; that old demon is still a powerful cultivator after all. I should contact Tan Hao and see what information he's gathered, and whether the Huang Long Palace's emergence is true."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind turned to the "Seven Master Buddha Seal."</p><p>She didn't want to miss the opportunity to obtain a Nascent Soul-level martial arts technique.</p><p>Her initial plan was to ask Yin Quan Zhenren to purchase it on her behalf. However, this would require her to hand over the herbs and the formula beforehand, something Qin Sang was unwilling to do, even with a soul oath.</p><p>Furthermore, if a better treasure than the "Seven Master Buddha Seal" appeared at the auction, she'd miss out.</p><p>Normal top-tier cultivation techniques or breakthrough secrets wouldn't be offered by those old masters.</p><p>But if it had fatal flaws, like the "Mysterious Mother Jade Tripod Scripture," Corpse Pills, or "Celestial Demon Transformation," and she could mitigate the risks using the Jade Buddha, she could acquire it at a low price.</p><p>Ideally, it should be something related to spiritual sense.</p><p>Qin Sang's application of spiritual sense was still in its early stages.</p><p>While pondering these things, Qin Sang slowly flew towards her cave abode.</p><p>Tan Hao hadn't left a message, and his whereabouts were unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang was considering going out herself.  The Wan Mo Assembly was imminent and the news would be spreading like wildfire, making it easy to find out information.</p><p>At that moment, she suddenly remembered something else in her Qian Jun Ring:</p><p>The mysterious ice box from Xuan Tian Palace!</p><p>Stronger spiritual sense inherently aids in breaking through restrictions and seals. Perhaps she could now open the ice box.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang immediately increased her speed, quickly returning to her cave abode to retrieve the mysterious ice box.</p>
