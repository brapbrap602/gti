<h1>Chapter 1678: Appearance</h1><p>Within the mountain's belly.</p><p>Amidst the dazzling golden light, a golden armored giant stood tall and proud. Its form appeared somewhat illusory, yet its every move possessed unparalleled might.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's golden armor was a treasure meticulously refined over many years by the Quyang Mountain lineage. Covered in符阵 (rune formations), it integrated various defensive rune prohibitions.</p><p>The Demon Monarch was sealed deep within the Celestial Harmony Hall, and Zhu Wudao had to traverse the outer Immortal prohibitions to reach it. Both the armor and the Soul Calming Incense were prepared for this purpose, and their power was naturally formidable.</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Wudao, disregarding all consequences, activated all the rune formations on the golden armor, willing to exhaust or even destroy it to eliminate external interference and buy himself time.</p><p>The Demon Son had just been unsealed and was at his weakest. Once this opportunity was missed, there would be no other.</p><p>Once the Demon Son regained his strength, Zhu Wudao would have no choice but to submit, a fate he was unwilling to accept.</p><p>The golden armored giant detached itself from Zhu Wudao and took a step forward. The boundless golden light instantly transformed into a golden wheel, rotating with the giant at its center.</p><p>Within the golden wheel, countless runes formed incredibly complex rune prohibitions, conjuring numerous smaller golden wheels, layered upon each other, creating an impenetrable defense.</p><p>Zhu Wudao hid beneath the golden wheel.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The sound of metal clashing echoed continuously. Golden rays erupted from the golden wheel, and the golden armored giant was enveloped in dazzling golden light, as if engulfed in golden flames.</p><p>Venerable Fan and True Person Hegao, noticing the commotion below, instinctively sensed an opportunity, despite not knowing the exact circumstances. They unleashed their magical treasures, assaulting the golden armored giant.</p><p>At that moment, a figure descended from the sky.</p><p>It was the Venom King.</p><p>The Gu King in Qin Sang's hands was of immense importance to the Venom King. However, he was entangled by Qin Sang's avatar.</p><p>The avatar wielded a spirit treasure, and the Ice Soul Divine Light made the Venom King wary, preventing him from breaking free immediately.</p><p>Knowing it would be difficult to gain any advantage over Qin Sang here, the Venom King, upon learning of the situation within the mountain from True Person Hegao, didn't hesitate for long and decided to deal with the most pressing matter first.</p><p>The Myriad Venom Mountain had a closer relationship with the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery. While they had disagreements with the Daoists, there was no deep-seated hatred. True Person Zilei's ascension to Deity Transformation only solidified the Daoists' dominant position.</p><p>The structure of the cultivation world wouldn't change drastically, and the Myriad Venom Mountain, located far in the Savage Continent, would be even less affected.</p><p>The Venom King was happy to see this trouble resolved.</p><p>He knew the dangers of the Demonic Tribulation.  The Myriad Venom Mountain, situated in the Savage Continent, bordered the Southern Continent. If the Demonic Tribulation resurfaced, the Myriad Venom Mountain and the Grand Clarity Sect would be the first top-tier sects to suffer.</p><p>Venerable Fan glanced around and let out a light scoff.</p><p>The Skyhowl Tower was constantly vying for power with the Daoists and Buddhists. He had no friendship with True Person Hegao and the Venom King, but rather some animosity.  He never thought there would be a day they would join forces against a common enemy.</p><p>Learning of the current situation from True Person Hegao, the Venom King immediately took action.</p><p>The three Grand Cultivators joined forces.</p><p>Intense golden rays almost erupted from Mount Dis bestow.</p><p>Under repeated heavy blows, the golden armored giant, despite its strong defenses, could no longer withstand the assault. Its knees buckled, and its form gradually shrunk.</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>Zhu Wudao had extracted the Demon Son's essence and swallowed it!</p><p>The instant the essence entered his body, Zhu Wudao froze.</p><p>Within the essence was a demonic shadow, the remnant will of the Demon Son.  At the moment of consumption, Zhu Wudao met the Demon Shadow's gaze.  As expected, there was fury.</p><p>The Demon Shadow opened its mouth wide, seemingly roaring, but with True Person Zilei's tribulation nearing completion, danger was imminent. Zhu Wudao wouldn't give the Demon Son a chance to influence him.</p><p>The Demon Son's essence entered his body.</p><p>Zhu Wudao was stunned for a moment.  Amidst the fury, was there also a hint of mockery?</p><p>He couldn't afford to dwell on it, as the impact of the Demon Son's essence surged like a tsunami, threatening to shatter his Nascent Soul.</p><p>He was currently using an ancient demonic cultivation technique, employing the most brutal method to merge with the other's essence and strengthen himself. It could also be called devouring.</p><p>This act was a gamble, but Zhu Wudao believed his chances of success were high.  The current situation wouldn't allow him time for thorough preparation. The opportunity was fleeting, so he acted.</p><p>At this point, the effect of the Soul Calming Incense became apparent.</p><p>The incense burned.</p><p>There was no fragrance, only a wisp of blue smoke that drifted towards Zhu Wudao's nose, entering his body and permeating his Nascent Soul.</p><p>It was this wisp of incense that allowed Zhu Wudao, even under the Demon Son's stubborn resistance, to maintain a sliver of clarity, protecting his core and sustaining the secret technique during the process of devouring the Demon Son's essence.</p><p>Soon, the essence merged with Zhu Wudao. He could feel the will within the Demon Son's essence gradually fading into chaos. His own consciousness was also somewhat blurred, and his body swayed unsteadily. However, the devouring process proceeded smoothly, unstoppable.</p><p>The Demon Son's resistance was weaker than Zhu Wudao had anticipated, indicating significant weakening from the seal.  The Demon Son's desperate attempt to escape earlier must have been a last-ditch effort.</p><p>His strategy of using True Person Zilei's tribulation to weaken the Demon Son proved correct.</p><p>The golden armored giant suffered repeated heavy blows, the golden wheel dispersed, and it seemed it could no longer hold on.</p><p>Just as True Person Zilei encountered his Heart Demon Tribulation, the three attacking the golden armored giant sensed the change above and their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>A crane's shadow soared into the sky, its cry mournful and piercing!</p><p>Venerable Fan and the Venom King exchanged glances.  They never expected True Person Zilei to encounter problems during the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>Beneath the golden armored giant…</p><p>A similar tragedy was unfolding.</p><p>As the secret technique neared completion, and Zhu Wudao's cultivation began to surge after merging with the Demon Son's essence, the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound poured into his mind palace through the Demon Son's essence, destroying his hopes of ascension!</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>A sharp, piercing shriek resounded.</p><p>Zhu Wudao suddenly awoke, blood flowing from his seven orifices.</p><p>His eyes widened, bloodshot, and his face contorted in agony.</p><p>Although the Soul Calming Incense had the effect of stabilizing the mind, its power was ultimately limited. Helping him resist the Demon Son was already its limit. How could it also block the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound?</p><p>He finally understood the mockery in the Demon Son's eyes.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao… had changed!</p><p>In fact, the Demon Son had been enduring the torment of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound all along.</p><p>With the Heavenly Dao's transformation, the Demonic Sound affected all equally.</p><p>Back then, the Demon Son's attempt to taint the Five Elements Crown was interrupted by the sudden appearance of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound.  By the time the Demon Son steadied his Dao Heart, it was too late to continue, as the Demon Spirit had already been born.</p><p>He faced the suppression of the seal and the threat of the Demon Spirit, his situation even worse than Venerable Huiguang and the Azure Fox Saint King trapped in the Hall of Delusion. The Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound inflicted even greater damage upon him.</p><p>Earlier, in his desperate attempt to escape, the Demon Son, disregarding everything, launched a frantic assault on the seal, enduring the terrifying impact of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound simultaneously.</p><p>Surrounded by enemies, he couldn't reveal his weakened state, lest Zhu Wudao, a follower of the Ancient Demon, have second thoughts.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even without revealing any weakness, Zhu Wudao, in his audacity, still dared to attack him. Suffering from the quadruple assault of the seal, the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, external enemies, and Zhu Wudao, he was finally exploited by Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Now, at this crucial moment of merging, Zhu Wudao's Dao Heart instantly crumbled.  He let out an inhuman shriek, his features twisting grotesquely. Black demonic Qi surged from his seven orifices, staining his blood black, and his skin began to tear as his entire body was enveloped in demonic Qi.</p><p>In a short time, Zhu Wudao lost his human form, resembling a demonic body corrupted by demonic Qi.  His roars became distorted, gradually resembling the Demon Son's voice.</p><p>Just then, another change occurred.</p><p>The seal suddenly sank, and a five-colored crown emerged from the depression.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown radiated brilliant light, its luster pure and untainted.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The golden wheel shattered, and the golden armored giant's body broke into several pieces, reverting to its armor form, its luster dimmed and its power lost as it was flung away.</p><p>Venerable Fan and the Venom King descended, witnessing the demonic body sink along with the seal.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown floated above the demonic body, pressing it down with immense force until it was swallowed by the seal!</p><p>Learning from past mistakes, the Demon Spirit, after two failed schemes, finally understood the wisdom of inaction.</p><p>She feigned severe contamination of her main body, focusing on cleansing the Filthy Yin Phosphorus Sand, and finally saw her opportunity after observing the battle unfold.</p><p>She had long coveted the Demon Son, her creator!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The Five Elements Crown settled perfectly atop the demonic body.</p><p>The crown trembled, and five-colored light cascaded down like tassels, instantly suppressing the demonic Qi. Then, a faint, almost imperceptible glimmer flashed, sinking into the demonic body's forehead.</p><p>Inside Zhu Wudao's Purple Mansion, his Nascent Soul had almost completely merged with the Demon Shadow, forming a Demonic Soul.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's consciousness was almost entirely lost, with the Demon Son's will dominating the Demonic Soul. However, the Demon Son, having been ambushed by Zhu Wudao and stripped of his essence, was caught off guard.  In his weakened state, he was struck by the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound and infected by its madness. He had to stabilize his Dao Heart first.</p><p>If the Demon Son could withstand the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound and survive this ordeal, he could be reborn in Zhu Wudao's body.</p><p>But at this moment, the Demon Spirit arrived.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Demonic Soul suffered an invisible impact, originating from the incoming point of light.</p><p>The Demonic Soul writhed in greater pain and distortion, emitting silent howls.  Its consciousness flickered between lucidity and confusion, seemingly muttering incoherently.</p><p>Something about seeing Zhu Wudao's fate.</p><p>But the Demon Spirit remained unmoved.</p><p>For her, this was also a golden opportunity.</p><p>The strongest enemy outside had failed his tribulation.  By seizing the Demon Son's True Nature, she would be unmatched here, free to devour cultivators at will.</p><p>Within Zhu Wudao's Purple Mansion, the glimmering light transformed into a tiny illusory figure, resembling a female Daoist of the Jade Platform Sect, only shrunk countless times. She gazed at the Demonic Soul with icy eyes.</p><p>Her small hands waved repeatedly, sending invisible shocks into the Demonic Soul.</p><p>With the Demon Spirit's actions, the Demonic Soul grew increasingly illusory, its moments of clarity shorter and shorter, its expression almost entirely consumed by madness and confusion, a sign of being assimilated by the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound.</p><p>Until the Demon Son's consciousness became completely chaotic.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Demon Spirit plunged directly into the Demonic Soul.</p><p>A piercing shriek suddenly echoed through the mountain's belly.</p><p>Above and below, dramatic changes unfolded. Venerable Fan and the Venom King, still puzzled by the cause, watched the seal and witnessed the sunken demonic body suddenly erupt from within.</p><p>The same demonic body, yet utterly different from before.</p><p>It wore the Five Elements Crown, seemingly fused with the spirit treasure, and the power of the seal was also channeled by the demonic body. Five-colored light enveloped it like a radiant robe.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The demonic body opened its eyes, one pupil blood-red, the other pitch-black, its gaze filled with uncontrollable chaos and madness, fixed upon the two figures above.</p><p>Then, a bloodthirsty hunger flared within the demonic body's eyes!</p><p>As an existence akin to a spirit tool, she was also affected by the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound. Fortunately, the Demon Son's True Nature was now unguarded against her.  But she craved the essence of cultivators, eager to devour them to replenish herself and accelerate the assimilation of the True Nature, making it easier to resist the Demonic Sound!</p><p>Unlike before, now that she had returned to her true form, her power was incomparable.</p><p>Meeting the demonic body's murderous gaze, Venerable Fan knew something was wrong. Without hesitation, he shot upwards.</p><p>Simultaneously, the petals of the Myriad Illusion Nether Lotus beneath him abruptly closed, and lotus shadows carrying illusion demons returned, instantly forming layers of illusory demonic figures around him.</p><p>At the same time, the demonic body raised its arm and pointed upwards.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown shone brilliantly, and five beams of different colors shot skyward.  Wielding not only the power of a spirit treasure, but also the force of the seal, they pierced through the layers of demonic illusions, striking Venerable Fan's true body directly.</p><p>The five-colored beams seemed to possess a binding power, instantly forming a cage that trapped Venerable Fan in place.</p><p>The next moment, an unexpected scene unfolded. The figure within the cage suddenly transformed, becoming one of the illusion demons that had guarded Venerable Fan earlier.</p><p>There was only one such illusion demon, always by Venerable Fan's side.</p><p>Now, the illusion demon took the blow for its master.</p><p>Venerable Fan's true body reappeared outside the cage, his face pale, and the Myriad Illusion Nether Lotus seemed to have become somewhat illusory. He didn't dare to pause, fleeing towards the mountain's exit.</p><p>As Venerable Fan was attacked, the Venom King also suffered.</p><p>The Demon Spirit fought against both of them, sending another five-colored beam towards the Venom King.</p><p>The Venom King didn't possess Venerable Fan's ability to shift between illusion and reality. Although he had already grasped his sacred artifact, the demonic body's attack was too swift, leaving no opportunity to activate the artifact's power.</p><p>Before the sacred artifact could unleash its poison on the demonic body, he was trapped by the five-colored beam!</p><p>In this critical moment, the Venom King decisively pierced his palm, forcing out his lifeblood to feed the sacred artifact.</p><p>The sacred artifact then emitted a piercing shriek and spewed a torrent of venomous smoke, similar to the Soul Extinguishing Smoke he had used before, yet different.  The smoke was denser and didn't drift towards his opponent, but instead swirled around the Venom King.</p><p>In an instant, the dense venomous smoke completely enveloped the Venom King, forming a giant gray cocoon.</p><p>The five-colored beam arrived in a flash, trapping the Venom King as expected, but a layer of the cocoon separated them. As the light penetrated the cocoon, it was repelled.</p><p>This wasn't the Venom King giving up resistance and surrendering to his fate.</p><p>As the upheaval began, he sensed a familiar, powerful aura approaching the mountaintop.</p><p>Venerable Huiguang!</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the mountain.</p><p>Venerable Huiguang silently watched True Person Zilei perish in the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>The situation was more dire than they had anticipated.</p><p>True Person Zilei vividly demonstrated the combined power of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound and the Heart Demon Tribulation, confirming their previous judgment.</p><p>Not even a high-ranking Buddhist monk, the abbot of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, would have a steadier Dao Heart than True Person Zilei.</p><p>It could be concluded that no Deity Transformation cultivators would appear in this world anymore.</p><p>They couldn't find any other help either.</p><p>Lost in thought, Venerable Huiguang suddenly lowered his head, his gaze fixed on Mount Dis bestow.</p><p>Within the mountain's belly, an extremely powerful demonic intent was brewing.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King, who had arrived later, also sensed it and immediately abandoned the other demons, rushing towards the mountain.</p>
