<h1>Chapter 1444: The Method</h1><p>Qin Sang and Ming Wei huddled together, their expressions tense.  The protective talisman concealed them from others, but they could clearly see what was happening outside.  Elder Ye’s gaze was icy, sharp as a blade, sweeping over them.</p><p>Ming Wei’s lips were pressed tightly together, sweat beading on her forehead, her heart pounding in her throat. Qin Sang clutched the jade vial containing the San Guang Jade Liquid. If things went wrong, he would have to use the liquid and fight Elder Ye to the death. However, Elder Ye probably didn't have much strength left, so Qin Sang remained relatively calm.</p><p>Seeing Elder Ye and his group leave, Qin Sang and Ming Wei relaxed. The crisis was averted.</p><p>Afterwards, more cultivators entered the cave, following Elder Ye. These individuals were secretly colluding, aiming to obtain the Soul Cleansing Liquid. Three vials had been stolen by a mysterious person who then disappeared.  Whether the Nascent Soul cultivator truly lost track of them or was employing some strategy remained unknown, leaving them focused on the last vial.</p><p>The group formed an alliance and pursued them.</p><p>At that moment, another battle erupted within the cave.  Xue Fu and the others were severely injured by Elder Ye. Their enemies seized the opportunity, and friends and relatives came to their rescue.  Chaos reigned, leaving the final outcome uncertain.</p><p>Blood once again stained the cave.</p><p>Uninvolved, Qin Sang and Ming Wei remained where they were, without removing the talisman.  Only after all the cultivators had disappeared deep into the passage, and they were certain no one else would enter from outside, did they cautiously reveal themselves.  Everything was normal.</p><p>Exchanging a look, they turned and left, randomly choosing another opening to escape. They navigated the complex cave system.  As before, Qin Sang led the way and provided vigilance, while Ming Wei remained ready to activate the talisman. The danger hadn't completely passed; only upon leaving the Labyrinth Cave could they be truly safe.</p><p>Finally, they emerged from the cave and entered the interior of the Ring Mountain.</p><p>Ming Wei looked up at the sky, shrouded in dark mist and gloom.  She anxiously asked, "Daoist Qin, wouldn't that old ghost block the exit and kill everyone for the Soul Cleansing Liquid?"</p><p>"If he were at his peak, it might be possible," Qin Sang replied, remembering the old demon cultivator Mu, who had dared to block the entrance to the Seven Kills Hall, slaughtering countless Foundation Establishment cultivators.  "His strength is impaired, and those people would prefer him to stay behind.  Being too overbearing would be tantamount to suicide. Besides, I sense they have already left..."</p><p>Qin Sang took out the ghost seal Su Nu had given him, able to sense her location.</p><p>To be safe, they didn't rush to reveal themselves, hiding in the shadows and observing for a while.</p><p>After some time, a cultivator flew out from the Labyrinth Cave's exit. He sighed, lamenting his loss—he hadn't obtained the Soul Cleansing Liquid, and the treasures in the Baobao Pavilion had likely been looted.  However, witnessing such a dramatic spectacle and seeing one of his enemies suffer a great misfortune made the trip worthwhile.</p><p>A slight smile played on his lips as he flew towards the stone peak, ready to leave the trial realm.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, Qin Sang and Ming Wei emerged from the Labyrinth Cave.  They vanished into the forest.</p><p>"Daoist Ming Wei, this is yours."</p><p>Qin Sang kept his promise, handing Ming Wei a vial of Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>Ming Wei was overjoyed, examining the vial repeatedly. She knew Qin Sang had taken three vials, but wisely didn't ask.  Receiving one was already more than enough.  Without Qin Sang, she would have likely returned empty-handed, wasting her ancestor's efforts.</p><p>Putting away the Soul Cleansing Liquid, Ming Wei hesitated. "Daoist Qin, you know how to refine the Soul Cleansing Liquid, don't you?"</p><p>"Oh?" Qin Sang was surprised. "Is there something special about refining it?" He had assumed it could be directly consumed.  He would need to ask Ning Wu Hui, he thought. As expected, Ning Wu Hui had not participated in the struggle for the Soul Cleansing Liquid and was nowhere to be found; otherwise, their chances would have been much greater.</p><p>Ming Wei nodded. "The Soul Cleansing Liquid's greatest value, besides increasing the chance of Nascent Soul breakthrough, is its ability to cleanse the soul and enhance spiritual perception.  Direct consumption wastes some of its potency. I have a method passed down from my ancestor for its refinement, Daoist Qin. You can refer to it."</p><p>Ming Wei handed Qin Sang a jade slip.  A hint of inquiry flickered in her gaze.</p><p>In the cave battle, Qin Sang had displayed various abilities unmatched by cultivators of the same level. It was strange that such a person remained unknown in the Demon Sea.  In Ming Wei's opinion, even the renowned Xue Fu and Xiao Yun Daozhang among those who had entered the trial realm were inferior to Qin Sang, who might be the most likely to break through to Nascent Soul.</p><p>It would be good to make a favorable impression on him.</p><p>“Soul Cleansing Ritual… I wonder how it differs from the Soul Light of the Soul-Nourishing Wood…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind flashed with this thought.  Without hesitation, he accepted the jade slip, bowing slightly. “Thank you, Daoist friend. I won’t stand on ceremony.”</p><p>Ming Wei smiled. “At last, I haven’t disappointed my Master. I’m preparing to leave the Seven Kills Hall. What are your plans, Daoist Qin?”</p><p>Qin Sang held the ghost seal, shaking his head. “That warning wasn’t sent for nothing. I made a promise to someone, and I can’t break my word. I have something else to do here.”</p><p>Ming Wei hummed in agreement.</p><p>She understood that Qin Sang’s advance knowledge of the Yuan Ying cultivator’s clandestine arrival must have had a reason. Seeing Qin Sang’s reluctance to elaborate, she didn’t press further.  She passed on the method for using the life talisman. “I have one more use left for this life talisman, but I won't need it.  Take it, Daoist Qin; it might be helpful. I am a disciple of Mujia Village. Our Master is easygoing, a dedicated ascetic, so there aren't many of us, and we’re not well-known in the cultivation world. But we can still protect a few fellow cultivators. After you leave the Seven Kills Hall, if you have time, feel free to visit Mujia Village…”</p><p>Qin Sang agreed.</p><p>This time, he had seriously offended the Dongji Alliance. If he couldn’t return to Xiaohan Region, befriending a Yuan Ying Master would be a good thing.</p><p>Ming Wei bid farewell to Qin Sang and flew towards the stone peak.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the life talisman. After a moment’s thought, he followed the ghost seal’s guidance to pursue Su Nu.</p><p>His deal with Su Nu was simple: he only needed to activate the ghost seal from a distance, and if things went south, he could retreat immediately. He wouldn’t have to risk himself by confronting Elder Ye; it wasn’t very dangerous.</p><p>“This method works, but it’s slow, refining the Cleansing Soul Liquid’s power bit by bit. Keep the liquid; I won’t refine it now. So much has already happened in the trial realm. Who knows what will happen in the inner hall, and I might need to intervene.”</p><p>Bai’s voice transmitted.</p><p>Qin Sang had just given Bai the method Ming Wei had given him.</p><p>“Good. Then I’ll keep it for you.”</p><p>Since he didn’t have time to refine it, Qin Sang put the two vials of Cleansing Soul Liquid into his storage pouch.</p><p>To avoid being detected by Elder Ye, Qin Sang dared not use his escape technique. He traveled through the forest alone. With Elder Ye scouting ahead, he didn’t have to worry about being exposed by disturbing the earth spirits.</p>
