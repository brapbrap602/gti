<h1>Chapter 475: The Legacy of the Cultivation Technique</h1><p>Chapter 475: The Legacy of the Cultivation Technique</p><p>Only one person is recorded to have successfully formed a Golden Core.</p><p>Qingzhu!</p><p>“….You must know him.  His name was Qingzhu, quite famous on Shaohua Mountain; some even called him the Sword Demon.”</p><p>Jing Po said.</p><p>It was him!</p><p>When Jing Po mentioned the creator of the cultivation technique, Qin Sang immediately thought of Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>At the cave dwelling of the Le sisters years ago, Qin Sang had discovered sword marks left by Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>He had guessed then that Senior Qingzhu had continued down the path of killing, either finding the latter half of the "Sword Soul Nurturing Chapter" or creating a subsequent technique.</p><p>Whether it was within his sect, at Xuanlu Pass, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, or even during his three years in the chaotic island waters, Qin Sang had never stopped investigating Senior Qingzhu’s whereabouts.</p><p>He always came up empty.</p><p>“After Senior Qingzhu disappeared, the sect also lost contact with him.  There was only a vague rumor in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.  For many years I’ve pursued Senior Qingzhu’s trail, but found nothing…Has Senior ever met Senior Qingzhu?”</p><p>Qin Sang carefully recounted his search, then asked Jing Po.</p><p>“Of course you couldn’t find him.”</p><p>Jing Po’s expression was unreadable, her tone flat.  “Because he died in the Ziwei Palace.”</p><p>Dead?</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>A legend of Shaohua Mountain, incredibly talented and inspiring countless younger disciples, his story still circulated within the sect…and he was simply dead?</p><p>Silently, he perished in the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Besides Jing Po, nobody knew.</p><p>Qin Sang had never met Senior Qingzhu, but felt a deep connection.</p><p>Hearing this news, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of loss.</p><p>Only those who had cultivated the "Sword Soul Nurturing Chapter" could understand how great Senior Qingzhu was.</p><p>Without the Jade Buddha’s protection, Qin Sang doubted he could have persevered until now.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu’s astonishing act of splitting his soul, and resisting the soul-devouring sword energy and the corrosive killing intent through sheer willpower, was unprecedented and unmatched.</p><p>How could one not admire him?</p><p>In Qin Sang’s eyes, Senior Qingzhu was one of the most qualified cultivators to enter the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Such a figure…simply dead?</p><p>Ziwei Palace!</p><p>If it was the Ziwei Palace, it made sense.</p><p>Legends abound of Yuan Ying experts perishing within the Ziwei Palace.  Qingzhu dying there wasn’t surprising, just incredibly regrettable!</p><p>“I wonder where Senior Qingzhu’s remains are buried?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked. He planned to pay his respects sometime.</p><p>Jing Po shook her head.  “His body is still in the Ziwei Palace, in a place heavily protected by restrictions, inaccessible to others.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. “Senior didn’t retrieve Senior Qingzhu’s body, yet obtained the subsequent cultivation technique? Was Senior an old friend of Senior Qingzhu’s, and did Senior Qingzhu gift the technique to Senior?”</p><p>Jing Po didn’t answer Qin Sang’s second question.  “I didn’t get the subsequent technique. I only know that Qingzhu left it where he died.  Only those who have cultivated the ‘Sword Soul Nurturing Chapter’ can enter that place. If you want the subsequent technique, you must get it yourself.”</p><p>“Go to Ziwei Palace myself…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed.  Suddenly realizing something, he exclaimed in shock, “Only those who have cultivated the ‘Sword Soul Nurturing Chapter’ can enter…This technique is connected to the Ziwei Palace?”</p><p>Jing Po asked in return, “Don’t you know that the ‘Sword Soul Nurturing Chapter’ was originally brought from the Ziwei Palace by an ancestor of your Shaohua Mountain?”</p><p>Qin Sang truly didn’t know.</p><p>The Baota Peak held no records about the origins of the "Sword Soul Nurturing Chapter."  Those he knew well, including Qi Yuanshou, were unaware of this secret.</p><p>Baota Peak had many incomplete cultivation techniques similar to the "Sword Soul Nurturing Chapter," their origins varied and strange, and very few could be successfully cultivated.</p><p>The "Sword Soul Nurturing Chapter" was actually related to the ancient immortal palace, Ziwei Palace.  No wonder the technique was so powerful. If not for the incomplete, uncultivatable fragments, cultivators throughout the entire Xiao Han Domain would have fought over it; Shaohua Mountain couldn't possibly have kept it.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head, composing himself. After a moment's consideration, he said solemnly, “Senior wouldn’t have revealed Senior Qingzhu’s whereabouts and the location of the subsequent technique for no reason, would she?  I’ve also heard of the Ziwei Palace. It’s filled with countless dangers. Even Yuan Ying and Golden Core cultivators must proceed with caution. It’s not a place for Foundation Establishment cultivators like us to enter.”</p><p>It seemed Jing Po had known he was cultivating the "Sword Soul Nurturing Chapter" all along.</p><p>Qin Sang even suspected that Jing Po had seen through him at their first meeting in the Wenyue Market.</p><p>Back then, Jing Po had accepted him into her secret market without investigation. Qin Sang had thought it was because of Shaohua Mountain, but now it seemed it was related to the "Sword Soul Nurturing Chapter."</p><p>Knowing this all along, yet only mentioning it now.</p><p>Qin Sang could only think of one reason why Granny Jing changed her mind.</p><p>The ebony sword.</p><p>The Blood-Soiling Radiance!</p><p>Granny Jing nodded, saying frankly, “You’re the second person I know who’s cultivated the *Chapter on Nurturing the Nascent Soul Sword* to this level.  It’s a pity you haven’t formed your Golden Core yet. You guessed right; I do need your lifebound spirit sword to help me with something.  A supernatural power like Blood-Soiling Radiance isn't common.”</p><p>As expected. Qin Sang hesitated, chuckled awkwardly, and tentatively asked, “Senior wouldn't want me to use my lifebound spirit sword against Leng Yuntian, the Sect Master of the Yuan Shen Sect, would you?”</p><p>He had heard clearly that Granny Jing’s original goal was Leng Yuntian, but only a Grand Elder had come.</p><p>Seeing Granny Jing actually nod, Qin Sang couldn't smile anymore.</p><p>He couldn't gauge Granny Jing's true strength; it probably wasn't much stronger than Leng Yuntian's, otherwise, she wouldn't have been so scheming.</p><p>Blood-Soiling Radiance was indeed powerful, capable of temporarily neutralizing magical artifacts, but it was only effective against artifacts, not cultivators themselves.</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator wouldn't rely solely on one artifact, would they?</p><p>He wasn't that arrogant as to confront a Nascent Soul cultivator directly.</p><p>Participating in a Nascent Soul cultivator's fight, even if only caught in the aftermath, would result in being pulverized.</p><p>"Rumor has it Leng Yuntian is a Nascent Soul cultivator…"</p><p>Granny Jing sneered, mockingly saying, “A pseudo-Nascent Soul cultivator! Leng Yuntian suffered severe injuries at the Purple Micro Palace during his late Golden Core stage, leaving a fatal hidden injury. Later, his master, Leng Qian, sacrificed his life to barely help Leng Yuntian break through before his death. But the injury remains, his cultivation will never compare to a true Nascent Soul cultivator; at most, he’s slightly stronger than a perfected late Golden Core cultivator, relying entirely on an ancestral artifact. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been holed up in the Yuan Shen Sect, not even daring to personally steal the Star Yuan Stones.  If the Purple Micro Palace wasn't opening, he'd still be a coward hiding in his shell!”</p><p>Leng Qian was the previous Sect Master of the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>A renowned and truly accomplished Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>“The Purple Micro Palace is divided into an inner and outer hall; Qing Zhu died in the inner hall.  Below the Golden Core stage, one cannot advance an inch in the outer hall. Once inside the inner hall, it's safer if you don't trespass into the ancient palace. If you agree, I can take you to the entrance of the inner hall and guide you to that place…”</p><p>Granny Jing said.</p>
