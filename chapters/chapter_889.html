<h1>Chapter 881: Yin-Yang, Canglan, Douniu</h1><p>Chapter 881: Yin-Yang, Canglan, Douniu</p><p>"I have some faith in Daoist Qi.  Brother Fang spoke highly of him, calling him one of the most promising candidates for Golden Core advancement on Douniu Island…"</p><p>Elder Huayang glanced at the new disciples, then at the Chen disciple, before clearing his throat.  "Since Daoist Qi is absent, I must discuss this with you, my esteemed colleague."</p><p>"Did Senior Lu leave any instructions before he departed?"</p><p>The Chen disciple asked solemnly.</p><p>The "Senior Lu" he referred to was Lu Xiaoyun, the current head of the Douniu Sect, who left to defend  the Great Waste Island after the demon unrest in the Demon Sea and hasn't returned.</p><p>Even the most rebellious of disciples wouldn't dare disobey Lu Xiaoyun's orders.</p><p>"While the Sect Master didn't explicitly state it, he tacitly approved,"</p><p>said Elder Huayang. "As you know, our Yin-Yang lineage has always lagged behind the Five Elements lineage.  In recent years, our decline has accelerated. This initiation ceremony has yielded disappointing results, far inferior to the Five Elements lineage. Thus, we've resorted to this strategy:  expanding recruitment to supplement our new disciples.  However, finding disciples with exceptional talent suitable for our Yin-Yang lineage's true teachings is difficult, especially after the recent intake earlier this year.  Hearing that Yanmiao Pavilion is holding its initiation today, I thought I'd try my luck…"</p><p>The expressions of those in the hall varied upon hearing the elder's words.</p><p>The new disciples were dumbfounded, thinking they'd misheard.  They had a chance to join the Douniu Sect, the largest sect on Douniu Island?</p><p>Holding their Yanmiao Pavilion tokens, their initial joy turned into a whirlwind of thoughts.</p><p>Even Zhao Songqiao, who had been weeping earlier, was shaken, his fingers clutching the token, knuckles white.</p><p>They also gained a new understanding of the Douniu Sect's domineering nature – daring to raid another sect to steal disciples.</p><p>Huasheng was also secretly surprised.</p><p>He had indeed heard that the Douniu Sect was broadly divided into the Five Elements and Yin-Yang lineages.</p><p>Two of the three main inheritances, the *Water Breath Scripture* and the *Wood Suppression Classic*, were Five Elements lineage techniques.  Other, lesser Five Elements techniques existed, leading to this lineage being the most numerous and prosperous.</p><p>The current Sect Master, Lu Xiaoyun, came from the Five Elements lineage.</p><p>In contrast, the Yin-Yang lineage appeared much weaker, its reputation undeserved.</p><p>Rumor had it that this was because the requirements for their true inheritance were too high; not only were suitable disciples hard to find, but the cultivation process was also more difficult than other inheritances.</p><p>It seemed the rumors were true. The Yin-Yang lineage's decline was so severe they were now raiding Yanmiao Pavilion for disciples.</p><p>The *Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique* wasn't without its merits; otherwise, it wouldn't be among the three main inheritances, but it couldn't address this situation.</p><p>Huasheng realized this was a rare opportunity. The Chen disciple clearly disliked him; staying meant constant limitations and possible expulsion.</p><p>This was a stroke of luck. Seizing this chance meant he could directly become a Douniu Sect disciple without maneuvering.</p><p>The only question was the Yin-Yang lineage's requirements and whether he could meet them.</p><p>Huasheng fell into deep thought, his eyes flickering.</p><p>In the hall, one person's anger grew with each word.</p><p>The Chen disciple's face darkened, as black as a pot.</p><p>Elder Huayang seemed oblivious, continuing, "I've brought the Yin-Yang Disc. Success or failure will be determined by a single test. It won't delay your Pavilion's affairs. Please grant me your cooperation."</p><p>As he spoke, Elder Huayang frequently glanced at Fang Ting behind the Chen disciple, showing far more interest in her than others.</p><p>He was cunning and shrewd, realizing Fang Ting’s special status and likely superior talent among the disciples, making her extremely attractive to him.</p><p>"Enough! Old scoundrel, you've gone too far!"</p><p>The Chen disciple's finger nearly touched Elder Huayang's face as he exploded in anger.</p><p>He seemed to have a long-standing grudge against Elder Huayang, having suppressed his anger until now.  Now, he had no qualms about ripping off the mask of civility.</p><p>"My esteemed colleague, why the anger?"</p><p>Elder Huayang flicked his whisk, maintaining a serene demeanor, as if counseling the Chen disciple. "The Sect Master once said that Yanmiao Pavilion and the Douniu Sect are one."</p><p>"Where the disciples cultivate is all the same..."</p><p>The Chen cultivator grew even angrier, rebuking, "Nonsense! If Senior Lu were guarding the mountain gate, this kind of behavior would never be allowed!"</p><p>Elder Huayang narrowed his eyes, calmly saying, "Do you truly think so, my brother? Don't you know that our Yin-Yang lineage is not only the foundation of Lan Dou Sect, but also made great contributions to the sect, yet led to the deaths of two highly promising senior brothers, an impact that continues to this day. Our current decline is inextricably linked to that event. Although the Sect Leader hails from Canglan Peak, would they really watch our Yin-Yang lineage decline and suffer the same fate as Douniu Peak?"</p><p>Douniu Peak?</p><p>The Disguise felt a sudden jolt.</p><p>Despite his extensive investigation, he had never heard of a Douniu Peak within Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>The main peak of Lan Dou Sect consists of five peaks: three Canglan Peaks and two Yin-Yang Peaks.</p><p>As the names suggest, the Yin-Yang Peaks are the training grounds for the Yin-Yang lineage disciples.</p><p>The three Canglan Peaks are for the Five Elements lineage disciples, with each of the two chief disciples occupying one peak, and the other disciples residing on the remaining peak. The Sect Leader's hall is also located on the Canglan Peaks.</p><p>This information is not a secret; it's common knowledge outside Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>Only Douniu Peak remains unknown.</p><p>Judging by Elder Huayang's tone, Douniu Peak seemed to have once been a significant lineage within Lan Dou Sect, comparable to the Yin-Yang and Five Elements lineages, but with a rather unfortunate end; it likely became extinct.</p><p>Could Qi Yunzi have been a disciple of this lineage? Could the lack of information be due to Douniu Peak's extinction, with no one left to cultivate that technique?</p><p>However, the perplexing thing is:</p><p>Four hundred years ago, Qi Yunzi, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, was still active. Even if the Douniu Peak lineage truly perished, its disappearance shouldn't have been so swift and complete.</p><p>The reasons behind this are likely only known to the upper echelons of Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>Of course, these are just the Disguise's own speculations and deductions, not necessarily accurate.  A thorough investigation of the circumstances is needed to understand what truly happened within Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>The Disguise's thoughts raced. His intuition told him Douniu Peak was strongly connected to what he sought.</p><p>This infiltration of Yanmiao Pavilion was worthwhile; he effortlessly overheard this secret, finally gaining direction, albeit just vague clues.</p><p>Elder Huayang and the Chen cultivator continued to argue.</p><p>The others, witnessing a dispute between Foundation Establishment cultivators for the first time, were terrified of becoming collateral damage and dared not breathe.</p><p>"Absolutely impossible!"</p><p>The Chen cultivator waved his arm, decisively saying, "Show them out!"</p><p>"Are you truly so stubborn, my brother?"</p><p>Elder Huayang's face darkened, and he coldly snorted, "You want the Sect Leader Lu's decree?  I'll write you one right now."</p><p>"You..."</p><p>The Chen cultivator was furious.</p>
