<h1>Chapter 2181 The Secret Code</h1><p>The tribal chief, even in defeat, remained calm and decisive, unlike someone who had just lost.  Qin Sang flew before the Fugu tribe leader, feigning ignorance: "Are you the chief of the Fugu tribe?"</p><p>"Indeed. My inadequacy led to my capture. I have failed my people.  Forgive my shame," the Fugu chief bowed. "I am Fu Kun.  What is your name, friend?"</p><p>"Chief Fu Kun!" Qin Sang nodded, showing no disrespect, returning the bow. "My Daoist name is Qingfeng."</p><p>He observed that Fu Kun was tall and slender, with one of his small wings damaged.  Though healed, the injury was clearly visible, explaining his weakened state.  This likely explained his initial alliance with Xie Tianjiao, and subsequent surrender.</p><p>The treasures left by the tribe's ancestors in the Bi Xie Ancient Temple were not to be touched by outsiders.  In his prime, Fu Kun would have fought to prevent this; his current state left him with no choice.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng, what are your intentions for us?" Fu Kun glanced at Xie Tianjiao in Qin Sang’s grasp.</p><p>"This man is treacherous and deceitful. I will not spare him!" Qin Sang declared fiercely, before softening his tone. "However, you are the rightful owner of the Bi Xie Ancient Temple.  Driving out intruders is only natural. I harbor no great resentment towards you..."</p><p>"But you won't readily release me," Fu Kun understood.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled enigmatically.</p><p>"If I help you open these halls, will you spare my life?" Fu Kun looked towards the shimmering depths. "Without someone familiar with the Bi Xie Ancient Temple's formations, even with your mastery, obtaining the treasures will be no easy feat."</p><p>"Those who adapt survive.  It's a pity we met here, Chief Fu Kun, otherwise, we might have shared drinks," Qin Sang sighed. "To be honest, the Bi Xie Ancient Temple wasn't my original target. I considered peaceful negotiations with your Fugu tribe."</p><p>Fu Kun's expression shifted. "If that's so, then your goal isn't the Poison Lake. Could it be the underwater mountain?" He pressed further, "What is the origin of this mountain?"</p><p>A flicker of resentment crossed Fu Kun's eyes.</p><p>Had it not been for this mysterious mountain, had the Bi Xie Ancient Temple not collided with it, he would have already entered the temple, obtained his ancestors' treasures, controlled the temple's formations, and even Qin Sang and Xie Tianjiao combined would not have been a threat. This mountain had ruined their plans and destroyed their ancestors' ambitions.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "It's related to the mountain. I must investigate to uncover its origin.  However, I heard some intriguing rumors from others, and I wish to confirm them with you."</p><p>"Ask away."</p><p>Fu Kun had no hope left. With him and Xie Tianjiao captured, no one could stop Qin Sang, who wouldn't pass up such an opportunity.</p><p>"What treasures did your Fugu tribe ancestors store in the Bi Xie Ancient Temple?" Qin Sang went straight to the point.</p><p>Fu Kun answered truthfully. "The treasures varied in value. The most precious included the ancestors' unique spells and techniques, personally refined spiritual treasures, and elixirs that could enhance our cultivators' cultivation and aid breakthroughs."</p><p>"So, most are closely tied to your Fugu tribe. Even if I obtain them, I might not be able to use or sell them," Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>"Our tribe is willing to buy them back from you!" Fu Kun immediately added, "I can distinguish between the sacred grounds and the outside. My defeat is my own fault, and I won't let resentment cloud my judgment. Victory and defeat are temporary. These treasures are of great significance to our tribe. If we can regain them, we will fulfill all your conditions."</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized Fu Kun. He seemed to have weighed the consequences before surrendering.</p><p>The treasures within the Bi Xie Ancient Temple held value only in the Fugu tribe's hands. For Qin Sang to maximize his gains, he needed to negotiate with them, meaning Fu Kun had to live.  Of course, Qin Sang wouldn't be at a loss; opportunities to exploit a tribe didn't come often.  Whether they harbored resentment didn't matter; the Fugu tribe was far away, and he certainly wouldn't be concerned.</p><p>"What about the central hall?" Qin Sang fixed his gaze on Fu Kun, continuing his interrogation.</p><p>If the rumors were true, Fu Kun, as the tribal chief, would surely know something.</p><p>The Fu clan leader fell silent, a flicker of struggle in his eyes, before resignation settled in. He sighed, “Each generation of our clan’s leader knows an ancestral teaching. Our ancestor left a treasure in the central hall of the ancient Scorpion Palace.  One day, when the sacred site undergoes a cataclysmic change, the central hall will open, allowing a descendant to receive guidance. They must act with caution.”</p><p>Forced to reveal these secrets, he gazed upward, muttering, “Fu Kun is unfilial, I beg our ancestor’s forgiveness.”</p><p>Alas, there was no response.</p><p>“Such a legend exists?” Qin Sang’s eyes gleamed. “What guidance?  And what does this cataclysmic change mean?”</p><p>“The ancestral teaching doesn’t specify.  I initially believed it heralded great fortune.  Now, I fear crisis accompanies it. The treasure can only point the way; ultimately, only those destined will possess it,” the Fu clan leader said earnestly, “Every word I’ve spoken is true.”</p><p>Qin Sang was silent, gazing into the depths of the shimmering light where the Scorpion Palace was dimly visible.  Undeniably, this was the day foretold in the Fu clan’s ancestral teaching.  Whether it brought fortune or misfortune, he would obtain the treasure; perhaps it would reveal the origin of the shimmering light.</p><p>…</p><p>Shortly after, three more figures burst into the collision zone. Qin Sang had brought Liuli with him.</p><p>Qin Sang led the way, with Liuli and the Fu clan leader following behind.  The Fu clan leader was under a restriction placed by Qin Sang.  Although the Fu clan leader willingly assisted, Qin Sang wasn’t entirely trusting, allowing him only to focus on disabling the Scorpion Palace’s remaining restrictions.</p><p>This time, free from treachery, the three worked together efficiently, quickly covering half the distance.</p><p>Their progress slowed, but remained steady, until they reached the nearest hall.</p><p>The hall had a single golden door, tightly sealed.  The restrictions on the door remained, albeit damaged, still requiring effort to breach.</p><p>Reaching the door, Qin Sang turned to the Fu clan leader, who stepped forward.  His tail swished, extending several meters, its tip gently touching the golden door.  Ripples of red spread across its surface.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>…</p><p>As if someone were knocking, the golden door resonated, then vibrated noticeably. With a ‘bang,’ the door suddenly swung open, revealing the interior.</p><p>The hall was empty except for a square wooden table in the center, holding a thumb-sized porcelain vial. The table was unremarkable; the vast hall contained only this tiny vial.</p><p>The Fu clan leader retreated, clearing a path.</p><p>Qin Sang, confirming the absence of traps, entered the hall and easily drew the vial into his hand.</p><p>The vial was tightly sealed.  A gentle shake revealed the sound of liquid inside; its nature unknown.  The Fu clan’s abilities often involved poison, so Qin Sang took precautions before opening it.</p><p>Upon opening the lid, an intensely foul odor emanated, revealing a vial mostly filled with a dark purple liquid.</p><p>“What poison is this?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked to the Fu clan leader; he didn't recognize it, but it was clearly a potent toxin.</p><p>“Li Sha essence!  Ten drops!”</p><p>The Fu clan leader’s eyes lit up upon seeing the liquid, then dimmed remembering Qin Sang was its rightful owner.</p><p>“Li Sha essence is the dream of every cultivator in our clan. Even the most gifted, if given a single drop in youth to refine their bloodline, would see their talent soar. In the previous halls, our clan found only seven drops, a fact that sparked much debate before distribution.”</p><p>The Fu clan leader hesitated; even knowing treasures increased in value closer to the central hall, the allure of ten drops of Li Sha essence was too strong.  He almost pleaded with Qin Sang to sell it to the Fu clan.</p><p>Qin Sang understood, examining the vial.  “For you, a miracle drug; for others, a deadly poison.”</p><p>“Indeed! Those of comparable cultivation, if they inadvertently inhale it, will suffer grievous harm. But its strong odor makes it difficult to conceal, unlike colorless, odorless poisons, though less potent,” the Fu clan leader pointed out its flaws.</p><p>“I understand. Thank you for the explanation, Fu clan leader.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, accepting it.</p><p>Seeing him make no mention of a transaction, the Fu clan leader refrained from urging him, faithfully following Qin Sang toward the next hall.</p><p>With no external interference, they opened three more halls. Unfortunately, some halls had been shattered in the collision, their treasures destroyed.</p><p>In the end, Qin Sang and his two companions opened nine grand halls, a truly remarkable feat.</p><p>Most halls contained only a single treasure: spiritual artifacts, jade scrolls, or rare and potent poisons, similar to the Li Sha Essence.</p><p>Unfortunately, nearly all the treasures were specifically tailored for the Hegou people. Even the poisons, like the Li Sha Essence, had unique uses for them, not for combat.</p><p>The Hegou ancestor's meticulous planning was not good news for Qin Sang.  Only four of the poisons, including the Li Sha Essence, were useful to him.  If he still possessed the Poison God Codex's lower volume and the poison pearl, he could refine these poisons and greatly enhance his cultivation.</p><p>For now, these poisons could only be used against enemies.  Qin Sang had numerous methods to deal with weaker opponents, rendering poison unnecessary. Against stronger foes, however, his expertise in poison was still lacking and required further study.</p><p>The Fu clan leader watched with envious eyes as Qin Sang collected treasure after treasure, sighing that none were useful to him.</p><p>Finally, with the Fu clan leader's help, Qin Sang reached the central hall.  In pristine condition, it was far grander and more ancient than the others.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the hall.  Its jade doors were tightly shut, surprisingly lacking any magical seals; they seemed easily opened with a push.</p><p>The Fu clan leader explained, "The hall originally had an ancient seal, personally set by the ancestor.  When the radiant light appeared, it vanished.  Obsessed by the discovery, we ignored the danger the light presented."</p><p>After a careful inspection, Qin Sang used a wisp of true energy to effortlessly open the doors.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>As soon as a crack opened, a white light shot out.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. He made a grasping motion, and a spectral hand materialized, seizing the light.</p><p>The light contained a talisman, over five inches long and nearly two inches wide.  Held between two fingers, it writhed, trying to escape.</p><p>Finally subdued, it lay still.  Qin Sang held the pure white talisman, which lacked any symbols or markings—a sealed charm.</p><p>Unable to discern its purpose, Qin Sang probed it with his spiritual sense, finding nothing.</p><p>He released the talisman, sealing off a large area around it. The talisman vibrated, shooting off erratically, like a frantic fly.</p><p>What kind of guidance was this?</p><p>Qin Sang looked to the Fu clan leader, who shook his head.  "Apart from ancestral teachings, I know nothing. Perhaps… the time is not yet right?"</p><p>"The sacred land hasn't been destroyed yet," Liuli added.</p><p>Legend claimed that the destruction of the sacred land would bring great opportunity.  Currently, it was in the midst of destruction, with the radiant light continuing to erupt.</p><p>"Then I can prepare myself before the time comes,"</p><p>Holding the charm, Qin Sang pondered the Thunder Hall.  He'd lacked the confidence before, but now he had Liuli, the captured Fu clan leader, and a Hegou cultivator outside – perhaps he could attempt it.</p><p>At that moment, the Fu clan leader spoke, his voice heavy. "I've helped you obtain the hall's treasures. How do you intend to deal with us?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "The Fu clan leader and your companion will do one more thing for me, then I'll release you.  I will trade some treasures with the Hegou people upon leaving. However, you must leave the sacred land before the next sky fissure appears!"</p><p>The Fu clan leader breathed a sigh of relief. As a prisoner, he dared not hope for more opportunities within the sacred land; survival was already fortunate.</p><p>"What task do you require?"</p><p>"I encountered a hidden realm, and I lack the manpower…" Qin Sang briefly explained.</p><p>"How can we trust you won't renege after we've helped?" the Fu clan leader frowned.</p><p>"You should have the Tai Xu Golden Book," Qin Sang stated.</p><p>The Fu clan leader nodded repeatedly, his worries finally eased.
