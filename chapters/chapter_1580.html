<h1></h1><p>After a period of pursuit, they could basically determine the approximate location of the Snow Fox's den.</p><p>It wasn't at the center of the snowy plains, but rather in the southwest.</p><p>During the pursuit,</p><p>Qin Sang and Yanshan Laoren took turns attacking, severely damaging the terrain and rendering it unrecognizable.</p><p>The Snow Fox showed no signs of increasing its speed, relying entirely on its ability to blink, but the blinking distance was limited and it couldn't shake off its pursuers.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>……</p><p>The two of them, with brute force, smashed large holes through the stone walls between the ravines.</p><p>The thick layer of snow muffled the commotion below, and there were no obvious tremors on the snowy plains above.  The Glacial Spirits continued to play carefree, completely oblivious.</p><p>However,</p><p>During their reckless charge, neither of them noticed that some of the Glacial Spirits were different from the others.</p><p>These Glacial Spirits weren't numerous, but they were scattered widely, almost covering every area of the snowy plains.</p><p>The difference between them and normal Glacial Spirits wasn't obvious, only that their eyes lacked the usual liveliness, and their behavior was less energetic.</p><p>Like soulless wraiths, they wandered aimlessly across the snowy plains.</p><p>Even if someone saw them, it would be difficult to notice the difference.</p><p>Previously, to avoid alerting the Snow Fox, Qin Sang and Yanshan Laoren had concealed their auras since entering the snowy plains and hadn't been detected by these unusual Glacial Spirits.</p><p>But when they started attacking and pursuing the Snow Fox, they couldn't and didn't need to hide their tracks any longer.</p><p>The moment they were exposed,</p><p>All the unusual Glacial Spirits froze.</p><p>As if receiving some kind of command, no matter where they were, they all turned simultaneously, staring fixedly in the direction of Qin Sang and Yanshan Laoren.</p><p>Even if there was only a stone wall in front of them.</p><p>This scene was extremely eerie, but unfortunately, no one witnessed it.</p><p>After a brief pause, the unusual Glacial Spirits moved in unison, all rushing towards that direction.</p><p>……</p><p>Beyond the snowy plains,</p><p>Within the area enveloped by the snowstorm, dark clouds blotted out the sun, even thicker than the snow layer below.</p><p>Above the dark clouds, the night wasn't gloomy. Moonlight, like flowing water, spilled onto the surface of the clouds, as if falling onto a boundless curtain.</p><p>Among the dark clouds,</p><p>The moonlight in one particular area was especially bright.</p><p>To the naked eye, this place was no different from any other, just brighter. The surrounding scenery was monotonous, with endless churning clouds.</p><p>Unbeknownst to anyone, a landmass floated within the clouds.</p><p>The landmass floated in the air, as light as a feather, suspended above the clouds like a ship, motionless.</p><p>Standing on the landmass and looking outwards, the view was unobstructed.</p><p>Clouds flowed around the landmass, and icy winds howled, but they couldn't penetrate the landmass at all. Clearly, an invisible barrier surrounded it.</p><p>The terrain of the landmass was higher in the south and lower in the north.  The north was a plain, and two mountain ranges stretched along the eastern and western edges, converging in the south.</p><p>At the convergence point, they formed a valley, which seemed to be the entrance.</p><p>A stone tablet stood at the entrance.</p><p>Inscribed on it were two ancient characters――Luye!</p><p>If anyone were to arrive here and see these two characters, they would be shocked, because Luye was the legendary cultivation ground of the Nascent Soul cultivator, Lu Laomo!</p><p>No wonder Luye had always been so mysterious, its location unknown. It was actually suspended in the sky!</p><p>If this person continued forward along the entrance, they would be even more astonished.</p><p>Entering the plain, a sea of vibrant flowers came into view.</p><p>Crimson, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.</p><p>Famous flowers from the Northern Wasteland to the Southern Barbarian Lands, even from overseas and the Western Desert, were all present here, blooming simultaneously regardless of the season, vying for beauty.</p><p>Not only that,</p><p>Some of the flowers were not only beautiful but also brimming with spiritual energy, clearly not ordinary flowers.</p><p>Three Essence Secret Flowers, Venomous Essence Flowers, Butterfly Shadow Treasure Flowers, Dreamlike Purple Jade Flowers…</p><p>Rare spiritual flowers rarely seen in the cultivation world were mixed here with ordinary flowers, treated as mere ornamental plants. Such extravagance would leave most cultivators dumbfounded, crying out in disbelief at the waste.</p><p>Exotic fragrances filled the air.</p><p>Spring water gurgled.</p><p>Among the flowers, there were beauties even more stunning than the blossoms themselves.</p><p>These beauties wore thin garments, revealing their flawless skin. Each one was a peerless beauty, possessing captivating charm, and each unique in their allure.</p><p>Like butterflies flitting through flowers, they played in the flower sea, some quietly appreciating the blossoms, others chatting and laughing together.</p><p>Under the moonlight, this scene and these people were breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>As if reaching a point of amusement, a burst of silver bell-like laughter suddenly rang out, charming and coquettish, yet completely devoid of vulgarity.</p><p>A young woman's face flushed pink, her eyes full of spring. Her watery almond eyes, shy and flirtatious, glanced towards the bamboo grove and bamboo houses in the northern part of the plain, with a hint of resentment.</p><p>Dozens of women played in the flower sea alone.</p><p>Who knew how many more resided within the bamboo houses.</p><p>These women were a mix of mortals and cultivators, even including some at the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Lu Laomo was the undisputed number one cultivator in the Demonic Path. He acted alone, unrestrained and unscrupulous, with countless lives on his hands. He had committed the brutal act of slaughtering entire sects more than once, terrifying countless cultivators.</p><p>This fiend had never been known to have a fondness for women.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew through Luye.</p><p>The bamboo grove rustled.</p><p>The bamboo in this grove wasn't ordinary either. It was a type of spiritual bamboo, with purple, sword-like leaves.</p><p>Inside the innermost bamboo house, a breathtakingly beautiful woman was meditating with closed eyes.</p><p>This woman's beauty was naturally no less than that of the beauties outside. She wore a white palace dress, yet there wasn't a trace of sanctity about her. Even in meditation, a seductive smile seemed to play on her lips. Those with weak willpower would be captivated by a single glance.</p><p>A red crescent moon mark on her forehead was the finishing touch, adding to her allure.</p><p>At this moment,</p><p>The woman in the palace dress seemed to sense something. Her eyelashes fluttered, and she slowly opened her eyes.</p><p>Her eyes were like water, even more captivating.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, she flashed out of the bamboo house and appeared at the edge of a circular pool deep within the bamboo grove.</p><p>The pool wasn't filled with clear water, but with rainbow-colored medicinal liquid.</p><p>The aroma emanating from the liquid formed a rainbow-like area around the pool.</p><p>As the woman appeared by the pool, her lips moved slightly, speaking silently.</p><p>A moment later,</p><p>Bubbles rose in the medicinal liquid.</p><p>A head emerged from within, surprisingly without any facial features.  Its face was smooth as a mirror, turning slightly to face the woman.</p><p>Even though the head had no eyes, the woman felt as if she were being stared at.  Her expression tightened slightly, and she quickly spoke a few words.</p><p>The head nodded slightly and then retreated back into the liquid.</p><p>As if relieved, the woman bowed slightly and turned to walk out of the bamboo grove, following a path through the flower sea towards the entrance of Luye.</p><p>As soon as she appeared, the women in the flower sea fell silent and stood respectfully, saying in unison,</p><p>"Greetings, Sister Yue."</p><p>Before this woman, these peerless beauties paled in comparison.</p><p>Ignoring them, the woman in the palace dress walked out of Luye without a sideways glance. She scanned her surroundings, chose a direction, and vanished into the dark clouds.</p><p>Only after her figure disappeared did the other women relax their respectful expressions. They dared not show any dissatisfaction with her aloofness, their eyes instead filled with envy.</p><p>Disturbed by the woman, the other women's enthusiasm waned.</p><p>However, there was no shortage of entertainment here.</p><p>As long as they didn't leave Luye, the master of Luye could fulfill any request they could imagine.</p><p>The only thing they had to do was maintain their perfect appearance.</p><p>Before long,</p><p>The barrier at the entrance of Luye was suddenly triggered.</p><p>An elderly man in a black robe landed in front of the stone tablet. True Essence flowed around him, cleansing him of the dust of his journey, before he stepped into Luye.</p><p>The women saw the old man from afar.</p><p>Some stood up, while others merely glanced before continuing with their activities, not at all as respectful as they had been towards the woman in the palace dress.</p><p>The old man walked into the flower field.</p><p>A woman said, "Wu Lao has returned."</p><p>Wu Lao was a serious man, still somewhat unaccustomed to seeing Luye transformed into this state.</p><p>However, he politely returned the greetings of every woman who addressed him, even if she was a mortal.</p><p>His gaze swept over these ethereal women, and a flicker of either pity or mockery flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He had seen too much over the years.</p><p>Group after group.</p><p>He couldn't remember how many batches of beauties these were.</p><p>There was a snake pit in the bamboo grove.</p><p>Once these women aged or developed any flaws, the master of Luye would unhesitatingly throw them into the snake pit to be fed to the snakes.</p><p>Even those with spiritual roots and cultivation talent, if they couldn't break through their realms in time and showed signs of decline, their bodies no longer perfect, they met the same fate.</p><p>They were like pampered pets, their destinies sealed the moment they were chosen to enter Luye.</p><p>Very few survived to this day.</p><p>With this thought flashing through his mind, Wu Lao passed by the snake pit in the bamboo grove, glancing at it inconspicuously.  He stopped and announced in a loud voice, "This old servant greets Young Master."</p><p>A moment later,</p><p>A lazy voice came from the bamboo grove, "Wu Lao has returned. Perfect timing! Come in and speak."</p><p>Wu Lao acknowledged the command and quickly walked into the bamboo grove, arriving at the edge of the medicinal pool. He took two jade boxes from his spatial pouch and presented them, "Reporting to Young Master, we have fortunately completed our mission and obtained the Black God Mud and the Ancient Tong Hua Tree Fruit."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>A surprised voice came from the medicinal pool, and two silken threads shot out, snatching the jade boxes. "It truly is the Black God Mud and the Ancient Tong Hua Tree Fruit.  Wu Lao, you've worked hard! Obtaining these treasures wasn't easy, was it? Did those fellows from the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Sweet Dew Monastery give you any trouble?"</p><p>Wu Lao replied, "They were preoccupied with their own affairs and didn't appear. However, recently, many individuals have been using Master's name to commit acts of arson, looting, and pillaging, causing panic throughout the Central Plains. It has indeed had a considerable impact."</p><p>The person in the medicinal pool was unconcerned, "Once this Young Master's divine abilities are perfected and the Three Corpses Death God Banner is refined, I'll round them up and use them as sacrifices for the banner."</p><p>Then a sneer followed, "The two Nascent Soul cultivators from the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Sweet Dew Monastery are indeed trapped in the Illusory Palace. Quite daring they are! Back then, my foster father found the entrance to the Illusory Palace and observed it for a long time, but ultimately only circled the outer perimeter.  With just the two of them, they haven't come out in two hundred years. They must have entered the deepest part and might even be trapped to death inside."</p><p>Wu Lao cautioned, "Nascent Soul cultivators possess unfathomable powers. Young Master, please do not underestimate them."</p><p>"This Young Master is naturally aware…"</p><p>Bubbles rose in the medicinal pool again.</p><p>This time, four heads emerged.</p><p>The three behind were identical to the previous faceless head, devoid of features, but they all turned to gaze at Wu Lao.</p><p>In front of the three faceless heads was a long-haired young man.</p><p>The young man also possessed exceptional beauty, remarkably handsome, with sword-like eyebrows and bright eyes, and a perpetual smirk playing on his lips, enough to fulfill any maiden's fantasies.</p><p>Glancing over the three faceless heads, Wu Lao's expression became serious as he congratulated, "Congratulations, Young Master, the divine banner is nearing completion!"</p><p>The young man chuckled, "It's a pity that my foster father was only focused on ascension, indifferent to worldly affairs, and only left me these few things! Otherwise, there would be no need for Wu Lao to personally make this journey, and this Young Master wouldn't have to wait until now."</p><p>As he spoke, the young man moved his neck, and a cracking sound came from his joints.</p><p>With a look of satisfaction on his face, the young man said, "Wu Lao's return is timely. Just now, Yuefei sensed someone trespassing in the snowy plains, and I was about to leave seclusion… Wu Lao, you go and take a look."</p><p>"The snowy plains?"</p><p>Wu Lao was startled at first, then realization dawned on him, "Is Young Master referring to the place where the Water Aspect Master of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect supposedly fell?"</p><p>"Precisely."</p><p>The young man nodded, "Did Wu Lao forget?  Back when Luye moved to this area, Yuefei discovered someone acting suspiciously in the snowy plains, but we didn't pay much attention at the time. This Young Master suspects that this is the place where the Water Aspect Master of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect fell, but unfortunately, we haven't been able to unravel its secrets. This person might be a descendant of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, so to avoid alerting them, I had Yuefei control a few Glacial Spirits and keep Luye stationed nearby, waiting for that person to reappear. This person is quite patient, making this Young Master wait for so many years."</p><p>Wu Lao frowned, "Legend has it that the Wuxiang Immortal Sect was once the sole overlord of the cultivation world.  Each of its five Immortal Halls could produce Nascent Soul cultivators, possessing strength comparable to a major sect.  The sudden disintegration of such a power, with all five Immortal Halls vanishing without a trace, remains a mystery to this day. If we can find the Water Aspect Master's relics, Young Master will surely gain immense power!"</p><p>"What mystery!"</p><p>The young man sneered, "The Eight Sceneries Sect and the Sweet Dew Monastery have always been secretive about the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.  They're likely the ones deliberately erasing traces of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect from the cultivation world.  They must have played a role in what happened back then! A centipede does not topple over after death. The Wuxiang Immortal Sect's legacy isn't so easily broken. Those people hiding in the shadows are probably already restless.  The disappearance of the two Nascent Soul cultivators from the two sects is a golden opportunity. They will definitely emerge to cause trouble. Just wait and see!  It's been so long. Whether the Wuxiang Immortal Sect is alive or dead has nothing to do with this Young Master, and I have no intention of avenging them. However, Wu Lao is right. If the Water Aspect Master truly fled to the Northern Wasteland and fell here, he must have had many treasures on him, and perhaps other surprises!"</p><p>After a pause, the young man added, "Yuefei said that the person is at the Mid-Nascent Soul stage. Yuefei herself might not be able to subdue him.  Wu Lao, remember to help Yuefei capture this person, preferably alive so we can extract his Nascent Soul. After this Young Master refines the Three Corpses Death God Banner, he will be the first main soul.  Mid-Nascent Soul, barely usable…"</p><p>Wu Lao nodded repeatedly and hurried away.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>The old chat group was banned for political discussion.
