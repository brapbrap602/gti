<h1>Chapter 728: Mutation</h1><p>Chapter 728: Mutation</p><p>The underground cavern resembled a thunderous swamp.</p><p>A knee-high subterranean river flowed below, while above, thick thunderclouds gathered.</p><p>This unusual geological formation was unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen.</p><p>How could such a place, devoid of sunlight, generate thunder?</p><p>He couldn't understand it.</p><p>Several six-petaled butterfly orchids grew at the far end of the subterranean river, rooted in crevices. Besides these, Qin Sang found two other excavated areas on the riverbank.</p><p>From the marks, he guessed that the excavators were after some kind of ore, not medicinal herbs.</p><p>This place was truly a treasure trove, containing not only the six-petaled butterfly orchids but also a strange ore.</p><p>The ore had been completely removed by a Wu tribe man; its type and value were now unknowable.</p><p>Unripe six-petaled butterfly orchids wither and lose almost all their medicinal properties once uprooted.</p><p>Judging by the man's actions, if the orchids didn't have this characteristic, he would have dug them all up before they matured.</p><p>Perhaps the formation of the thunderclouds was connected to this unknown ore.</p><p>Standing in the water, Qin Sang looked up at the thunderclouds, then down at the Sky Eye butterfly in his palm.</p><p>After entering the underground space, the Sky Eye butterfly awoke and immediately expressed a strong desire to leave, targeting something within the thunderclouds.</p><p>If there were treasures in the thunderclouds, wouldn't the Wu tribe man have already taken them?  As a Wu tribe cultivator, he'd likely have a spirit insect.</p><p>Could the thunderclouds only be attractive to the Sky Eye butterfly?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't recklessly release the Sky Eye butterfly. Instead, he took out the Fat Silkworm. The silkworm showed no interest, confirming his suspicions.</p><p>The thunder in the clouds wasn't as terrifying as that in the outside world. The lightning produced was very thin, but it was impossible to use spiritual sense to investigate.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang channeled his true energy to shake the thunderclouds.</p><p>For a time, the cavern was filled with swirling mist and rumbling thunder.  Soon, he stopped, having seen the core of the thundercloud—it was just a mass of cloud.</p><p>Finding nothing, Qin Sang released the Sky Eye butterfly.</p><p>The butterfly joyfully flapped its wings, flying beneath the thundercloud and circling.</p><p>Soon, it hovered in the center below the cloud and began to flap its wings rapidly. The Sky Eye butterfly, though not weak, created a strong wind that stirred the thunderclouds.</p><p>Unlike Qin Sang, the wind generated by the butterfly had a strange suction. As the thundercloud vibrated, a wisp of milky white smoke gradually formed within Qin Sang's view.</p><p>This wisp of smoke was extremely thin and was drawn into a line by the suction, its other end being the butterfly's mouthparts.</p><p>The Sky Eye butterfly was absorbing this smoke!</p><p>Qin Sang was amazed.  To him, the thundercloud was ordinary, simply condensed water vapor, yet the butterfly treated it as a delicacy. He could clearly sense the butterfly's joy and satisfaction.</p><p>"What could be in the thunderclouds...?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, glanced at the distant six-petaled butterfly orchids, and quickly moved over to them.</p><p>The orchids were exquisite, vibrantly colored, and there were six of them – enough for the Sky Eye butterfly to reach its second peak transformation.</p><p>The descriptions of six-petaled butterfly orchids in the Yu Ling Sect's ancient texts were sparse, mentioning only that they were a favored food of Sky Eye butterflies and could be used to cultivate them.  There was no detailed information about their properties or growth environment.</p><p>"Could the unknown white mist in the thunderclouds be the reason for the growth of these orchids, and the white mist is what the Sky Eye butterfly truly craves?"</p><p>Qin Sang could only guess.</p><p>He took out six jade boxes and carefully collected the six-petaled butterfly orchids. Seeing that there were no other treasures, he returned to the center of the subterranean river to observe the Sky Eye butterfly.</p><p>In a short time, the white mist grew thicker, becoming as thick as a chopstick.</p><p>The tiny butterfly's body seemed like a bottomless pit, greedily devouring the mist.</p><p>At that moment, a dense series of thunderclaps echoed from deep within the thundercloud.  Then, a flash of lightning suddenly appeared in the center of the mist, merging with it.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression changed. He was about to urge the butterfly to dodge, but it showed no fear and instead flew towards the lightning and mist, and with a powerful inhalation, swallowed both!</p><p>Qin Sang was dumbfounded.  He hadn't anticipated this, had no time to stop it, and hastily flew over, anxiously watching the butterfly's changes.</p><p>What would happen if it swallowed the lightning?</p><p>Even the smallest bolt of lightning represents the most ferocious power in the world!</p><p>Tianmudie hovered in mid-air.  The white mist dissipated, the wind stilled, and everything seemed to fall silent.</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely anxious.  She contacted Tianmudie mentally.  The good news was that Tianmudie's consciousness remained stable, but its aura was far from calm.</p><p>Tianmudie rested on Qin Sang's hand, enveloped in wisps of white mist. Its body trembled, clearly impacted by the lightning.</p><p>Tianmudie's impulsive action caught Qin Sang off guard, but she couldn't just stand by.  The only thing she could do was use their bloodline connection to pour her spiritual energy into it.</p><p>As time passed, Tianmudie's tremors gradually lessened, having passed the most dangerous point.  Then, its aura finally stabilized.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief and leaned closer to observe carefully, but found that Tianmudie hadn't changed much after swallowing the lightning power.</p><p>Only the patterns on its wings seemed slightly brighter.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Tianmudie flapped its wings again, flew back up, and continued to devour the white mist and lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. This time, she didn't stop it, letting Tianmudie do as it pleased.</p><p>With each ascent and descent, Tianmudie became more at ease, devouring the white mist and lightning in large gulps.</p><p>Once the last wisp of white mist was consumed, Tianmudie returned to Qin Sang's palm, lying there listlessly. Then, its wings suddenly began to glow.</p><p>Between the peculiar patterns, silver light danced.</p><p>The light grew brighter, and white mist swirled around it, eventually forming a cocoon of lightning that enveloped Tianmudie.  Tianmudie lay inside the lightning cocoon, falling into a deep sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the entire transformation without interfering, but she remained anxiously monitoring Tianmudie's condition.</p><p>Qin Sang was certain this sleep wasn't a metamorphosis, but was related to a very rare phenomenon recorded by the Wu tribe:  a spiritual insect mutation!</p><p>Generally, a spiritual insect has only one specific ability.</p><p>It has been observed that spiritual insects have the chance to mutate when they encounter certain fortuitous circumstances.  The probability of such a mutation is extremely low, but it's not uncommon in the Wu tribe's long history of insect-rearing.</p><p>Spiritual insect mutations are random and cannot be replicated.  Qin Sang never expected to encounter such a fortuitous event here.</p>
