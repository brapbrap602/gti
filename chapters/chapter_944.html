<h1>Chapter 936 Confirmation</h1><p>Chapter 936 Confirmation</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Bai.</p><p>"If that person was waiting for you, how could you easily discover him? I knew you might come, and I stayed here after sensing the tremors. He arrived shortly after you entered. He set up some kind of formation outside, and inevitably revealed flaws while doing so, which I detected.  I couldn't see his true form, but a spirit formation couldn't be completely flawless. Carefully examine those spots…"</p><p>Bai transmitted his voice, guiding Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious which Nascent Soul master would be watching him.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly used its power, scanning the canyon back and forth.</p><p>No one was visible, but Qin Sang felt uneasy.</p><p>"I can unleash the ghost mist to disrupt the magic barrier and force him to reveal himself.  The magic barrier becomes unstable after each tremor—that's normal, don't worry about alerting him," Bai volunteered.</p><p>"No rush!"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then called out, and the Sky-Eye Butterfly flew from his dantian, fluttering gracefully before landing on his shoulder.</p><p>The tremors Bai referred to were likely the aftershocks from each attack on the Immortal Formation.  The Seven Kills Hall was sealed by the Immortal Formation, and its fluctuations affected the interior.</p><p>Seeing the Sky-Eye Butterfly, Bai was momentarily stunned. The fellow actually had a three-stage spiritual insect hidden away.</p><p>"I don't resent losing,"</p><p>Bai muttered to himself, his resentment dissipating considerably.</p><p>After summoning the Sky-Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang ordered his avatar and two-headed… to… Then he slowly closed his eyes, communicating with the Sky-Eye Butterfly telepathically, focusing his spiritual sense onto the butterfly.</p><p>This was a Wu tribe secret technique, used with a life-bound insect.</p><p>Master and insect combined their powers to temporarily enhance the abilities. The forbidden technique used by the Fang youth before his death was similar, but Qin Sang's technique was much gentler, and thus less powerful.</p><p>Using this technique greatly consumed the user's spiritual sense; Qin Sang couldn't sustain it for long.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, its wings spread, facing the canyon.</p><p>After several molts and mutations, the patterns on the Sky-Eye Butterfly's wings were extremely beautiful.  The eye-like markings were aesthetically pleasing, not at all frightening.</p><p>The eye patterns resembled real eyes, their gaze seemingly shifting.</p><p>From any position, one felt observed by the Sky-Eye.</p><p>Qin Sang's spiritual sense merged with the Sky-Eye Butterfly, jointly activating its divine ability.</p><p>The patterns on its wings lit up, becoming even more captivating, mesmerizing the viewer.  Light flowed continuously into the central eye, becoming radiant.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly's wings trembled slightly, causing concern that its delicate body couldn't withstand the strain.</p><p>At that moment, the 'pupil' in the central eye actually rotated, transforming into a real eye, staring intently at the canyon beyond the demonic fire.</p><p>Silently and invisibly, the Sky-Eye swept across the canyon inch by inch.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang signaled Bai, "Thirty percent power!"</p><p>Without any visible action from Bai, the ghost mist behind them suddenly pressed down, causing the ground to tremble slightly. The demonic fire at the canyon entrance swayed, releasing a wisp of demonic fire energy, and the ancient prohibitions on the stone walls flickered before returning to normal.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang helped the Sky-Eye Butterfly fully activate its divine ability.</p><p>In that instant of instability in the magic barrier…</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, turning serious.</p><p>At the canyon entrance, a section of the stone wall, as hard and dense as iron, was covered with ancient prohibitions. Otherwise, it appeared empty.</p><p>This was one of the spots Bai had indicated.</p><p>Yet the Sky-Eye Butterfly detected a subtle fluctuation there—a tiny, square-shaped shadow that flashed past.  Without Bai's warning, Qin Sang wouldn't have noticed such a slight anomaly.</p><p>Rare insects were so valued because their innate abilities far exceeded those of ordinary spiritual insects; they could transcend their level. If the Sky-Eye Butterfly broke through to the late third stage, it could even see through the concealment of a Nascent Soul master.</p><p>With Qin Sang's assistance, the Sky-Eye Butterfly's ability increased dramatically, reaching a level comparable to the late third stage.</p><p>If someone was indeed lying in wait, only a Nascent Soul master could hide so perfectly, and their cultivation might be even higher than expected!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>In a flash, everything returned to normal.</p><p>At the canyon entrance…</p><p>A figure sat cross-legged in the shadows, like a monk in meditation—it was Elder Mou, having cleverly escaped.</p><p>He hurried to the Purple Mist Netherworld and found traces of his target, who had once again passed through the demonic fire blockade and entered that unknown ghost land.</p><p>Old Man Mou was both surprised and delighted.</p><p>Had he been a little quicker, he could have captured the other person directly. Now, he could only wait and see.</p><p>Earlier, Old Man Mou had been observing the other Nascent Soul cultivators, and he hadn't noticed any unusual behavior. This suggested that whoever had passed through the demonic fire into the Ghostland was likely a Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>Unless some old geezer, like himself, had used some method to escape and arrive beforehand.</p><p>Old Man Mou wasn't quite sure.</p><p>This demonic fire was feared even by him and the other late Nascent Soul cultivators.  No one had ever entered the Ghostland since time immemorial.  For a mere Core Formation cultivator to do so was akin to a fairy tale.</p><p>To be safe, he'd taken an extra precaution, setting up a spirit formation to ambush the other person upon their exit.</p><p>Sensing a subtle fluctuation in the demonic restriction, Old Man Mou lifted his eyelids, his gaze sweeping across the demonic fire and the Ghostland, finding nothing unusual.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and Bai had retreated back into the depths of the ghostly fog.</p><p>"It seems you've figured something out! You don't need to find the real body to believe me, do you?"</p><p>Bai, inhabiting the Flying Night Yaksha's body, curled his lips into a smile.</p><p>In the gloomy Ghostland, his smile was unsettling.</p><p>"Enough!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked preoccupied, lost in thought, before staring into Bai's eyes. "I can confirm there were no anomalies when I entered.  It's clear you and the resentful spirits fear the demonic restriction; it's specifically targeting you!  It's impossible that the manipulation happened outside the Ghostland, otherwise, you would have left long ago. Doing so unnecessarily would have alerted that person, making my situation even more dangerous."</p><p>A satisfied expression appeared on Bai's face. "It seems you're also a clever one. Now, let's discuss the deal."</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang raised a hand. "This person couldn't have entered with me. The problem must lie here! You've been trapped in the Ghostland for a long time; this isn't the first time you've seen him, is it? What else do you know? What's his cultivation level?"</p><p>"Correct, this isn't the first time he's appeared. He came again shortly after you left last time. As for his strength…"</p><p>Bai fell into reminiscence, his face clouding with gravity. "Among those who've appeared and been detected by me, the strongest was at most a late Nascent Soul cultivator. He revealed his aura once, only slightly weaker than a late Nascent Soul cultivator."</p><p>"Just below late Nascent Soul…"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>This matched his earlier judgment – at least a mid Nascent Soul expert!</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Failed to adjust sleep schedule.</p>
