<h1>Chapter 661: The Fiendbane Pill</h1><p>Perhaps to prevent Nascent Soul cultivators of the Wu Clan from seizing treasures within the Seven Kills Hall, this rule was established. After all, Core Formation cultivators, with their limited power, are certainly no match for Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Thus, the Nascent Soul ancestors of the Wu Clan are kept at bay.</p><p>Wu Clan cultivators needn't worry about being ambushed in the Seven Kills Hall. Both human and Wu Clans have made a pact to unite against the demon hordes within the Tempest Demon Sea.</p><p>At least within the Canglang Sea, the two clans maintain a superficial peace, a significant improvement from the past, with no major conflicts for a long time.</p><p>Furthermore, regarding the Seven Kills Hall, humans have made promises to the Wu Clan.  They naturally wouldn't break their covenant and lose face over mere Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>Therefore, whenever news of the Seven Kills Hall opening spreads, a group of Wu Clan Core Formation cultivators will journey across the ocean seeking treasures, Du Han among them.</p><p>As for why Du Han embarked on this long journey to explore a human secret realm during the early stages of Core Formation, it relates to the path he chose.</p><p>This also answered Qin Sang’s earlier question.</p><p>The Canglang Sea, much like Qin Sang's prior findings, is lacking in spiritual materials, medicinal pills, and especially heavenly treasures, unlike the abundance found in the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>Yet, it is surprisingly easier for human cultivators here to reach Core Formation than in the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>This is due to a pill known as the Fiendbane Pill.</p><p>Similar to the Bloodbone Pill, this pill is also crafted using demonic beasts as the primary ingredient, supplemented by some relatively common spiritual herbs. It possesses the miraculous ability to aid in Core Formation!</p><p>Both human and Wu Clans have independently chosen to refine pills from demonic beasts, not because the Bloodbone Pill and Fiendbane Pill are related, but out of necessity.</p><p>Lacking other resources, they can only utilize demonic beasts.</p><p>While hunting demons within the Tempest Demon Sea is perilous, it pales in comparison to the near impossibility of finding heavenly treasures.</p><p>However, consuming the Fiendbane Pill, like the Bloodbone Pill, carries significant risks.</p><p>Because it is refined from demonic beasts, the Fiendbane Pill contains traces of demonic煞 energy, which even the master alchemists of the Canglang Sea cannot remove.</p><p>When Foundation Establishment cultivators refine the potency of the Fiendbane Pill, it stimulates the spiritual energy within their core, increasing the probability of breaking through.  Simultaneously, the demonic煞 energy within the pill infiltrates the cultivator's body, taking root in their Nascent Soul!</p><p>The more Fiendbane Pills consumed, the more demonic煞 accumulates within.</p><p>Should the demonic煞 erupt, the cultivator goes berserk, losing their sanity, beyond any cure. Consequently, there's a limit to how many Fiendbane Pills one can take, prohibiting reckless usage.</p><p>Even so, the probability of reaching Core Formation is considerably higher than for cultivators in the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>The hidden dangers of demonic煞 entering the body gradually manifest after Core Formation.  Not only does the cultivator emit a faint demonic aura, but their post-Core Formation strength is also affected.</p><p>Most terrifyingly, if the demonic煞 energy within the Nascent Soul isn't purged, it hinders further breakthroughs.</p><p>While the impact on minor realm breakthroughs is manageable,</p><p>any trace of demonic煞 energy in the Nascent Soul completely prevents reaching Nascent Soul!</p><p>Every cultivator who reaches Core Formation with the aid of the Fiendbane Pill must embark on a long journey of refining their Nascent Soul and purging the demonic煞.  This deeply rooted demonic煞 energy is incredibly stubborn. Many cultivators, even those reaching late-stage Core Formation, fail to completely eradicate it, forever barred from Nascent Soul.</p><p>Therefore, given the same number of Foundation Establishment cultivators, the Canglang Sea sees more successful Core Formations than the Small Cold Realm, but the number who achieve Nascent Soul remains similar.</p><p>This Fiendbane Pill can only be refined by Canglang Sea cultivators, who have access to the Tempest Demon Sea.  The Small Cold Realm lacks the abundance of demonic beasts for such slaughter.</p><p>Furthermore, refining the Fiendbane Pill has specific requirements for the demonic beasts: peak-stage Spirit Demon and early-stage Demon Core beasts are optimal.</p><p>Lower cultivation provides insufficient potency.</p><p>Higher cultivation results in excessive demonic煞 within the pill, overwhelming the consumer.</p><p>Moreover, Fiendbane Pills have five elemental variations, and cultivators must choose carefully which to consume.</p><p>The allure of the Fiendbane Pill is immense, offering hope to those unable to reach Core Formation.</p><p>While some choose to strive for Core Formation independently, they are those with exceptional talent and unwavering confidence in themselves.  The vast majority find the temptation of the Fiendbane Pill irresistible.</p><p>Qin Sang understood this mindset. His decision to sell himself into servitude for Foundation Establishment followed a similar logic.</p><p>Break through first, address the consequences later.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this was good news. His future opponents, weakened by the demonic煞, would be easier to defeat.</p><p>He even considered taking a few Fiendbane Pills himself to feign weakness.</p><p>With the Jade Buddha, he needn't fear demonic煞 invading his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Hearing about the Fiendbane Pill's effects from Du Han, Qin Sang was momentarily lost in thought.</p><p>Protected by the Jade Buddha, the pill's risks were negligible; he could consume as many as he wished.  Had he landed in the Canglang Sea, he wouldn't have needed to endure such hardship, refining himself into a corpse-like state, just to find a chance for Core Formation.</p><p>However, had he ended up here, he would have missed out on the *Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Scripture*.</p><p>One is the difficulty of breakthroughs, the other is cultivation speed.</p><p>Only Qin Sang could weigh the trade-offs.</p><p>Qin Sang’s earlier perception of Du Han being somewhat overrated stemmed from the latter’s use of the Fiendbane Pill.</p><p>While the Fiendbane Pill is beneficial, few Wu Clan cultivators choose to use it.</p><p>The first reason is naturally the inherent risks.</p><p>Secondly, for unknown reasons, upon demonic煞 entering their bodies, Wu Clan cultivators lose their innate talents, unable to suppress the backlash from their natal Gu insects, forcing them to abandon this path.</p><p>Not only does their strength greatly diminish, but years of effort are also wasted.</p><p>Moreover, it is said that the chance of breakthrough using the Fiendbane Pill isn't much higher than relying on natal Gu insects.  Only in desperate situations would Wu Clan cultivators consider this option.</p><p>Du Han, facing the hopelessness of reaching Core Formation, made the difficult decision to abandon his natal Gu insects, successfully achieving Core Formation with the Fiendbane Pill.</p><p>Taking this step, there was no turning back.</p><p>After reaching Core Formation, Du Han ventured out to gain experience, befriending many human cultivators and switching to human cultivation techniques. This was his reason for entering the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Unexpectedly, on his first visit, he encountered a significant event—the descent of an ancient corpse from the heavens!</p><p>This scene left a deep impression on the present cultivators.  Some quick-witted individuals even preserved it within crystals.  Du Han possessed one such crystal in his mustard seed bag.</p><p>The descent of the ancient corpse occurred near the grandest pagoda within the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Shrouded in clouds and reaching into the sky, this pagoda is known as the Celestial Tower.</p><p>Countless restrictions and dangers lie within the Celestial Tower, with legends claiming that even Nascent Soul ancestors haven't reached its peak.</p><p>In such a place, an ancient corpse suddenly descended from the sky.  This unprecedented event understandably caused a huge commotion.</p><p>Many suspected the severed-armed corpse belonged to an ancient cultivator from the Celestial Tower’s peak.  Even if not, a cultivator capable of reaching the peak must be extraordinary, possibly carrying invaluable treasures.</p><p>Many cultivators near the Celestial Tower were drawn to the event, including Nascent Soul ancestors.</p><p>Despite their numbers, they could only watch helplessly as the severed-armed corpse vanished.</p>
