<h1>Chapter 1449: A Misunderstanding</h1><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Large snowflakes swirled in the air.</p><p>Suddenly, a brilliant sword light pierced the snowy expanse.</p><p>Around the sword light, the swirling snowflakes silently melted, the wind stilled.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a figure followed the sword light, Qin Sang easily escaping the range of the Winter’s Seal.</p><p>Shi Xue, sensing the situation behind her, was even more shocked to see Qin Sang break free so quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, his gaze shifting.  Seeing Shi Xue fleeing westward, he was about to attack, but suddenly sensed something, his eyes lifting to look ahead of Shi Xue.</p><p>His senses detected two powerful auras rapidly approaching; no wonder Shi Xue was escaping in that direction.</p><p>“It’s the Xuan Tian Palace, and not just her! Two Yuan Ying mid-stage elders at once.  As expected of the number one sect in the North Sea!  I don’t know how many other experts are on their way…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind raced, his spiritual sense quickly scanning the area.  Confirming that no more people were immediately present, he surprisingly didn’t choose to flee. Instead, he lightly tapped the Jin Chen Sword, swiftly performing a sword incantation.</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword trembled slightly, then suddenly shot out.</p><p>The sword’s hum sounded like the roar of a dragon and tiger, or like a clap of thunder, shocking the soul.</p><p>Although the area wasn't covered by the Winter’s Seal's power, under its influence, the light of day had become rather dim, as if it were deep winter night.</p><p>In this dark and cold world,</p><p>the Jin Chen Sword unleashed a dazzling light, streaking across the sea like a meteor, aiming for Shi Xue’s neck.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang’s thunder wings flapped, and he pursued.</p><p>Shi Xue, sensing the intensely sharp energy behind her, felt a chill down her spine.  A stinging pain shot through her neck, her pupils contracting violently.</p><p>At the same time, Elder Lan and Elder Mei saw the scene, exchanging shocked glances.</p><p>Although Shi Xue’s cultivation was slightly lower, her strength wasn’t weak.  Currently in charge of the Tingxue Pavilion branch, she possessed considerable resources.</p><p>Judging from the situation, Shi Xue had even used the Winter’s Seal, yet she was still at a disadvantage, completely routed, and fleeing for her life!</p><p>Her opponent was only one person, and in such a short time!</p><p>Just who is he?</p><p>The two elders were astonished.  Regardless of the consequences, they flew towards the scene, their gazes fixed on the figure chasing Shi Xue, only to see a mass of silvery-white electric light.</p><p>The opponent clearly noticed them, yet showed no intention of escaping, relentlessly pursuing Shi Xue.</p><p>Whether this person was simply vengeful or had other intentions, it was clear that he possessed extreme confidence in his own strength.</p><p>The two elders’ hearts were heavy; they might have severely underestimated their opponent!</p><p>Shi Xue was in danger, and the situation was urgent.</p><p>They didn't have time to think, hastily summoning their treasures.</p><p>Elder Mei’s finger twitched, a tiny, snow-white vortex inexplicably forming at her fingertip, seemingly containing countless icy breaths.  Then, a drop of ice formed and fell.</p><p>*Crack, crack, crack…*</p><p>The sea surface suddenly froze, a path of ice rapidly extending towards Shi Xue.</p><p>Elder Lan, a transparent bracelet somehow appearing in his hand, tossed it upward.</p><p>The bracelet spun rapidly, not towards Qin Sang, but into the sky. As it flew, the bracelet expanded greatly, and its brilliance caused the heavens to seem as if a second moon had appeared.</p><p>This was Elder Lan’s famed treasure, the Sun-Catching Ring.</p><p>However, the Jin Chen Sword was now extremely close to Shi Xue.</p><p>Seeing the sword about to pierce her neck, Shi Xue, not daring to rely entirely on the two elders, grabbed the jade pendant at her waist, engraved with the image of a door.</p><p>The pendant glowed brightly, and Shi Xue disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, a halo of light appeared in the nearby void, and Shi Xue reappeared, her face even paler, her jade pendant shattered.</p><p>But the crisis wasn’t over!</p><p>The familiar stinging sensation returned; the sword's speed and her opponent's reaction were beyond imagination, relentlessly pursuing.</p><p>Shi Xue, still reeling, felt her heart tense again.</p><p>Then, the reinforcements finally arrived.</p><p>The ice path had somehow extended to Shi Xue, abruptly stopping and rising, layer upon layer of ice forming an ice shield behind her.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>A muffled sound echoed as the Jin Chen Sword struck the ice shield.</p><p>Ice fragments flew everywhere, the shield shattering, but successfully blocking the strike.  More ice rapidly formed, a new shield instantly taking shape.</p><p>Almost simultaneously,</p><p>the moon in the sky shone with blinding brightness, the ring focusing a beam of light on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a premonition and moved sideways, but the moonbeam still grazed him.  An intensely cold power, accompanied by an unfamiliar energy surge, poured down from above.</p><p>His first reaction, almost instinctive, was to summon his spirit-body talisman to take the blow.</p><p>But then he recognized the energy fluctuation; it was similar to the ice-based imprisonment earlier.</p><p>Changing his mind, he abandoned the talisman idea and activated the Ruyi Treasure Pearl in his dantian. A faint golden energy shield immediately enveloped him.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The immense force struck the shield.</p><p>The shield pulsed, flickering, but held, refusing to shatter.</p><p>"Not bad!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently, very pleased with the Ruyi Treasure Pearl's performance in its first battle.  As he expected, the ice-based imprisonment had little effect on him thanks to his Fire Armor.</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>Shi Xue, having just been rescued, breathed a sigh of relief.  Seeing Elder Lan's attack, she remembered that in her escape, she hadn't warned them.  She cried out urgently, "The Winter Seal is ineffective against him…"</p><p>Elder Lan instantly understood.</p><p>The Winter Seal's imprisonment and his attack shared a similar origin.  Since the Winter Seal failed, his attack wouldn't fare much better.</p><p>He frantically tried to expand the imprisonment, manipulating the seawater to create an ice cage to briefly trap Qin Sang.  But it was too late.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged unscathed, stepping easily out of the beam.</p><p>With a flash, he retracted the golden shield and silently formed a sword hand sign.</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>Thousands of swords appeared, obscuring the sky.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>In an instant, the ice shield exploded.</p><p>Shi Xue's eyes widened, the rest of her warning swallowed as a familiar sense of danger washed over her.</p><p>Two figures appeared before her.</p><p>The two other Elders finally arrived.</p><p>Elder Mei swept his sleeve, forcefully pushing Shi Xue away from the danger.</p><p>The attack missed again.</p><p>But instead of anger, Qin Sang smiled slightly, silently chanting, "Seven Souls Killing Array!"</p><p>This was the moment he'd been waiting for – to trap both Elders in his sword formation!</p><p>Silently,</p><p>The Elders felt the surrounding light grow even darker, a sense of danger gripping them. Without hesitation, they lunged outwards, shouting together!</p><p>"Misunderstanding…"</p>
