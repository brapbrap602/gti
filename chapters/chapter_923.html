<h1>Chapter 915: The Lord of the Sacrifice Demon Cave</h1><p>Chapter 915: The Lord of the Sacrifice Demon Cave</p><p>“The Harmonious Light Sect?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, recalling the sect.  The ruler of a large island ten thousand miles north of the Riftwind Archipelago, its leader was a Yuan Ying master, but only one. Similar to the Lan Dou Sect, it was in decline.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. After separate questioning, he learned that the scholar had offended only an elder of the Harmonious Light Sect, accidentally killing a beloved disciple, forcing his escape to the Riftwind Archipelago. That elder wasn't a particularly important figure in the sect. If it had been the Yuan Ying master, or a Yuan Ying adopted son like Master Lu, he might have hesitated.  But as for other Foundation Establishment cultivators, Qin Sang didn't care much. Besides, this was the Riftwind Archipelago, a chaotic place.</p><p>Qin Sang had some prior knowledge of the Sacrifice Demon Cave, a group of demonic cultivators who had banded together, aggressively recruiting, and forming a considerable force in the area.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was questioning the scholar's family...</p><p>The Lord of the Sacrifice Demon Cave had already landed on Poison Island and discovered the illusion array. This person was a late Foundation Establishment cultivator; a mere illusion array couldn't fool him.</p><p>“Hmm? When was this island occupied? Has the island's eagle king been eliminated?”</p><p>The Lord of the Sacrifice Demon Cave stopped before the illusion array, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>At this time, his subordinates arrived, riding gusts of dark wind, landing beside him.  Initially, they hadn't noticed the illusion array. Seeing the Lord's unusual expression, they looked closely and realized the poisonous miasma was unusual, mixed with an illusion array.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>The elders and others were secretly startled, gasping in fright. “Poisonous miasma mixed with an illusion array—what a vicious method! Lord, when did this Poison Island acquire an illusion array? Has some senior cultivator established a secluded place here?  Why have we never heard of it? Could the corrupted wing eagle king have been eliminated?”</p><p>The Lord of the Sacrifice Demon Cave snorted.  “How would I know who did it? Look above—those are all ordinary-stage corrupted wing eagles, unusually docile.  It’s clear the eagle king and the other powerful demonic beasts have been eliminated. I wonder which cultivator has such great ability to silently occupy this Poison Island…”</p><p>The Lord of the Sacrifice Demon Cave narrowed his eyes, pondering for a moment before his expression shifted. He suddenly sent a voice transmission to the elders.</p><p>The elders were startled.</p><p>“Lord, the person who could kill the eagle king on Poison Island is undoubtedly powerful. We should try to contain him, gather more people, and then slowly deal with him…”</p><p>“Slowly deal with him? By the time we leave, he'll have long since fled.”</p><p>The Lord of the Sacrifice Demon Cave interrupted the elder, coldly saying, “I want that person! And the island as well.  Those corrupted wing eagles—if I weren't wary of their poison, I would have long ago eliminated those troublesome creatures with Daoist Xun. This person killed the eagle king, perhaps using some kind of antidote. Their true strength may not be that great, otherwise, why stay in this place, leaving the corrupted wing eagles as a disguise, hiding their identity? This illusion array can only trap you; it's not a particularly sophisticated array. Of course, I won't act rashly. I'm just letting you prepare. Daoist Xun is nearby; I've secretly sent a message to him. Let's first probe the other party's background…”</p><p>“Since the Lord has already sent a message to Senior Xun, it will surely be foolproof!”</p><p>The elders were overjoyed upon hearing this, standing silently behind the Lord. Each held a strange iron token in their palm, concealing their actions.</p><p>The “Senior Xun” they mentioned was the second most powerful figure in the Sacrifice Demon Cave, after the Lord himself.</p><p>“Zuo doesn't know this island has been established as a secluded place by a cultivator.  I've come today without warning; please don't mind, fellow cultivator.”</p><p>The Lord of the Sacrifice Demon Cave stood with his hands behind his back, looking up at the top of the illusion array.  His voice boomed, penetrating the illusion array.</p><p>Qin Sang also heard the Lord’s voice, his heart tightening, his face filled with terror.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a sigh came from within. “This poor cultivator thought you were only passing by my cave, so I didn’t want to disturb you.”</p><p>The Lord of the Sacrifice Demon Cave smirked.</p><p>“Hehe, Zuo wasn't specifically coming here, but was chasing some traitors from the Sacrifice Demon Cave, which brought me here.  But thanks to them, Zuo learned there was a new neighbor.  Since we've met, it's fate.  Fellow cultivator, why not remove the illusion array and show yourself for a chat?  We in the Sacrifice Demon Cave are eager for talent and need cultivators of your skill…”</p><p>He didn’t mention the girl at all, instead recruiting Qin Sang.</p><p>After a moment of silence, the poisonous miasma suddenly parted to the sides, revealing a passage. After a ripple, a figure appeared before them.</p><p>Meanwhile, they felt a gust of wind beside them, and two figures appeared on either side, surrounding them.  It was the two-headed beast.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, what is the meaning of this...?"  The Si Mo Cave Master's face changed drastically at this sight. He never expected that such a barren place, a poisonous island reeking of stench, would hide two Foundation Establishment cultivators and a powerful demon beast.</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "Cave Master Si Mo, your arrival brightens my humble abode. However, your subordinates' concealed weapons are not the actions of a guest. And that insect you released earlier—were you communicating with someone?"</p><p>The Cave Master Si Mo's actions were extremely cautious, and the messenger insect was adept at concealment, but it couldn't escape the Tianmu Butterfly's eyes. Qin Sang had seen everything.</p><p>The Si Mo Cave Master forced a laugh, "Fellow Daoist, please don't misunderstand, I was only being cautious..."</p><p>As he spoke, his eyes suddenly filled with intense black light, transforming into black demonic pupils.  A strange gaze pierced the poisonous miasma, revealing the scene within the spirit array.</p><p>"A mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator dares to play tricks in front of me? You're courting death!"</p><p>Confirming there were no other ambushes, the Si Mo Cave Master sneered, "Attack!"</p><p>The elders and others were already prepared. At the Cave Master's order, the remaining four spread out around the elders, suddenly throwing iron plaques.</p><p>The power of these plaques had already been activated. With a series of dull thuds, they merged into a single beam of dark light, like an arrow shooting towards the two-headed beast.</p><p>Simultaneously, a shocking scene unfolded. The Si Mo Cave Master's figure flickered, and he turned to flee towards the outside of the poisonous island.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang ready to attack without a word, and facing not only two Foundation Establishment cultivators but also a powerful demon beast, he had been seized by fear and decided to retreat, planning to regroup with his companions and counterattack later.</p><p>His subordinates clearly hadn't expected the Si Mo Cave Master to act in this way.  They were stunned, then their faces turned pale as they realized they had been abandoned.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but chuckle. These old demons were truly not to be trifled with.</p><p>"Since you've come, why the rush to leave?"</p><p>A shadow of a dragon appeared on Qin Sang, transforming into a red light as he instantly blocked the Si Mo Cave Master's path.</p>
