<h1>Chapter 1822: Half-Puppet Body</h1><p>Mo Xingdao and Hong Yuzi had searched for the Azure Fox Saint King for many years, and she suddenly appeared before them.</p><p>Moreover, she had laid a trap and ambushed them in a place neither of them could have anticipated!</p><p>Qingfei, also known as the Azure Fox Saint King, sensed Mo Xingdao's gaze, glanced sideways, and met his eyes.  A charming smile curved her lips, then she bowed gracefully towards the heavens.</p><p>One bow, and the moon ascended.</p><p>The wind stilled, and a Spirit Lake appeared.</p><p>The water in the lake below shimmered, reflecting the moon, large as a silver platter.  Water and moon met, locking heaven and earth.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King and Xiahou were clearly prepared.  The Water-Moon Cage imprisoned both Hong Yuzi and Mo Xingdao.  Mo Xingdao had no time to escape before his retreat was sealed.</p><p>The scene was all too familiar to Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Years ago, during the hunt for the Ancient Devil at the Formless Immortal Sect, the Azure Fox Saint King had used this Fox Spirit Moon Worship technique to trap the demonic body.</p><p>Mo Xingdao had assisted the Azure Fox Saint King in hunting the devil, and now he was about to personally experience the power of this demonic art.</p><p>Back then, the Azure Fox Saint King needed the assistance of several Nascent Soul cultivators.  Now, she had trapped two of them with her own power, its might not diminished but amplified.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's heart sank, his eyes filled with terror. Without hesitation, he retreated wildly, his palms colliding.  Thick black energy surged from his arms like two black dragons, converging into his palms and finally transforming into a sharp cone, which he fiercely thrust at the Water-Moon barrier behind him.</p><p>Hong Yuzi, no longer concerned with Mo Xingdao, glared at Xiahou and threw a yellow scroll into the air.</p><p>This yellow scroll was called the Thousand Mountains Chart, and unlike common magical treasures, it was a supreme treasure of the Talisman Dao.</p><p>As its name suggested, this treasure was a type of talisman chart.</p><p>It was crafted by a cultivator proficient in the Talisman Dao, who tirelessly inscribed divine runes that could manifest mountain shadows day and night.  Each additional divine rune was equivalent to adding another mountain shadow.  Once the chart was unleashed, it possessed a terrifying power comparable to a thousand mountains.</p><p>Those with weaker cultivation would be instantly crushed into paste!</p><p>It was said that the form of the divine runes wasn't complex; the difficulty lay in combining these divine runes into a chart, a feat only a grandmaster of the Talisman Dao could achieve.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>As if an invisible hand were rapidly flipping the pages of the yellow scroll, it instantly reached the last page.</p><p>Each time a page was turned, the illusory shadow of a black mountain appeared, merging with the previous mountain shadows.</p><p>Layer upon layer of mountain shadows stacked, their color deepening.  By the end, it could no longer be called a mountain shadow, but a true mountain peak!</p><p>At this moment, the moon was above, the Spirit Lake below, but between the moon and the lake, a giant mountain stood tall, as if it could pierce the moon and collapse the lake at any moment!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The black mountain trembled and plummeted down.</p><p>Shrouded by the shadow of the giant mountain, even the powerful Xiahou felt a sense of oppression, his heart shaken.</p><p>Xiahou's eyes flashed with killing intent.  Since it was an ambush, his attack would be a killing blow, holding nothing back!</p><p>His blood and Qi surged to the heavens.  His figure leaped, merging with the illusory image of a divine deer.</p><p>The divine deer let out an excited roar, adding to its divine aura, its eyes even fiercer, its speed dramatically increasing.  Before the giant mountain could fall, it charged madly towards the formation!</p><p>Blood-colored light flooded the sky as blood diffused from its antlers, distorting the void. The antlers were like sharp blades, tearing through the void, leaving ear-piercing sonic booms in their wake, targeting the leader of the demon soldiers.</p><p>The leader's eyes were bloodshot.  His cultivation was only at the early stage of the Hollow Profundity realm.  Facing a late-stage Hollow Profundity realm expert, also of the demon race, he was inevitably suppressed by the heavenly might emanating from his opponent.</p><p>Years of close companionship and countless drills had fused his and his soldiers' auras together.  Backed by the altar, he could resist this suppression of heavenly might.</p><p>If the formation was intact,配合 with the talisman chart’s罡阵, even without Hong Yuzi's intervention, he could hold his ground against his opponent for a while.</p><p>However, the enemy's ambush, taking advantage of the unstable formation, had thrown the battle into chaos.  The demon leader could only fight with his life.</p><p>The leader stood on his hind legs, his eyes wide and round like bronze bells, and roared furiously at the sky.</p><p>Hong Yuzi's soldiers were all elite warriors, fearless and loyal to him.</p><p>Even at this critical juncture, the demon soldiers did not lose their fighting spirit.  Even those who were injured and vomiting blood struggled to maintain their stance.</p><p>At this moment, all the demon soldiers frantically forced out their blood and Qi.  Hong Yuzi's palm faced downwards, clenching suddenly.  Spiritual power surged wildly. Despite the slightly scattered formation, their blood and Qi still formed a blood diagram, finally condensing into a blood seal, which embedded itself into the leader's forehead.</p><p>This was a secret technique used only in times of crisis.</p><p>The leader's momentum surged, his bloodlust rising.  His agile figure showed no sign of retreat as he slammed head-on into the divine deer!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The collision between the divine deer and the demon leader caused the Water-Moon Cage to tremble violently.</p><p>The demon soldiers spat out blood, many of them falling backwards, incapacitated.</p><p>The golden-eyed leopard desperately resisted the deer's antlers, but was inevitably pushed back repeatedly, the blood seal shattering, blood flowing from its seven orifices.</p><p>Fortunately, the black mountain descended just in time, smashing heavily onto the divine deer's head.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The divine deer's whole body trembled, its forward momentum abruptly halted.</p><p>Hong Yuzi seized the opportunity to activate the altar.  Light flashed, drawing the remaining soldiers into the altar.</p><p>The divine deer shook its head and exchanged glances with the Azure Fox Saint King above.</p><p>Their eyes met, and the two demons reached a consensus: this ambush on Hong Yuzi could be considered a failure.</p><p>As expected of a Celestial Official of the Dao Court, even after breaking through his formation, killing him would be no easy task, unless Xiahou was willing to fight to the death.</p><p>Xiahou had already made his decision.  If the first strike succeeded, then fine; otherwise, he would retreat, lest things get complicated.</p><p>Moreover, their objective had been achieved.</p><p>The moon shimmered, and the moonlight abruptly shifted from the Nine Returning Pearls, locking onto Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, gripping the long cone, had just taken advantage of the chaos to open a gap in the Water-Moon Cage. Locked by the moonlight, he finally understood the pressure the demonic body had endured back then.</p><p>His body stiffened, but his eyes blazed with madness.  Thunder rumbled within him, his body expanding rapidly, his aura exploding wildly.  Against the pressure of the moonlight, he stepped out of the cage.</p><p>But at the moment of his escape, Mo Xingdao's pupils constricted sharply.</p><p>The two demons seemingly ambushed Hong Yuzi, but their true target was Mo Xingdao. How could they not have a backup plan?</p><p>Before Mo Xingdao could see the scene outside, a sinister wind struck his face. A terrifying force hit him squarely in the chest, sending him flying backwards.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's vision darkened.  He barely managed to steady himself, only to find the Azure Fox Saint King standing before him, smiling seductively.</p><p>Facing this stunningly beautiful fox demon, Mo Xingdao felt no enchantment, only endless chill.</p><p>He anxiously looked towards the other battlefield, only to discover in despair that four celestial pillars had risen from the lake surface.  Hong Yuzi was entangled by Xiahou, trapped within the pillars.</p><p>“I've been waiting for you for a long time.”</p><p>An icy voice reached his ears.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's heart turned cold.  His mouth opened wide, and a stream of Profound Qi shot from his throat, transforming into a flying knife that slashed towards the Azure Fox Saint King.  At the same time, he raised his arms, about to fight back desperately, only to discover in horror that a strange force had invaded his body.</p><p>The force coursed through him, and wherever it passed, his body seemed to slip from his control.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King’s smile widened, a halo descending from the sky, intercepting the Profound Qi flying knife.</p><p>Even Hong Yuzi's Nine Returning Pearls were blocked by the halo.  Although Mo Xingdao's Profound Qi had been refined for many years, it could not compare to the Nine Returning Pearls.  It was trapped on the spot, reverting to its original essence.</p><p>The essence pulsed with life, struggling left and right, but it couldn't break through the halo.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King gracefully approached Mo Xingdao, raised a jade hand, and gently pressed it towards his forehead.</p><p>Mo Xingdao resisted frantically, but a numbing sensation spread from his torso to his legs and arms.</p><p>At this moment, his puppet-like, stiff face came alive. His features shifted, expressing a mixture of horror and hatred.</p><p>A trace of enchantment suddenly flickered in the Azure Fox Saint King’s smile, her eyes emitting a strange light.  Staring into Mo Xingdao's eyes, her voice was like a whisper, reaching the depths of his mind.</p><p>“Surrender now! Follow me, and I will spare your life…”</p><p>Her jade finger pointed at Mo Xingdao's forehead.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's eyes briefly glazed over, then were filled with terror and madness.  He stared fixedly at the Azure Fox Saint King, as if wanting to sear the image of his enemy into his memory before he died.  A gray mist spread across his eyes.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King frowned, seemingly surprised.  The moonlight intensified, focusing on her fingertip, surging madly into Mo Xingdao's body, but it was too late.</p><p>The appearance of that deathly aura signified the dissipation of Mo Xingdao's life force.  In his last moments, he would rather destroy himself than be controlled by the Azure Fox Saint King.</p><p>To fall into her hands and be refined into a puppet, eternally controlled by his enemy, would be a fate worse than death!</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Qin Sang, who was rushing towards the battlefield, suddenly heard a scream and felt his shoulder lighten.</p><p>The scream came from the Kingfisher.</p><p>The Kingfisher swayed and plummeted.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat.  After forcing out the details, the Kingfisher fell silent. The situation on the battlefield seemed extremely dire; Mo Xingdao had no time to communicate with him.</p><p>The Kingfisher's sudden fall, could it be…?</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly stopped, reaching out to catch the Kingfisher, only to see, in astonishment, that as it fell, its body grew larger and became distorted.</p><p>Its wings extended into arms, its bird head transforming into a human head.</p><p>In an instant, the Kingfisher transformed into a dark-skinned, strange man, his aura vastly different from before.  He let out a hate-filled roar, “The Azure Fox Saint King killed my true body!”</p><p>True body?</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily bewildered, looking the dark-skinned man up and down, a thought stirring in his mind.</p><p>At the Formless Immortal Sect, Qin Sang had witnessed Mo Xingdao’s puppet firsthand, and the Puppet Crystal had even come from him.</p><p>After reuniting with Mo Xingdao, Qin Sang had sensed that the puppet’s aura was somewhat different.</p><p>But Mo Xingdao had declared his identity, and considering the conditions Qin Sang knew the two Soul Formation cultivators had given him, he hadn't suspected anything.</p><p>Looking again now, this person before him seemed even more like a puppet!</p><p>However, this puppet's aura was weak, only comparable to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Qin Sang had a vague guess, his surprise evident.</p><p>“In the Storm Realm, they and my Natal Puppet protected me as I used a secret technique to refine myself into a half-puppet body to overcome the tribulation and break through to Soul Formation!  Rather than linger on the edge of death, I would rather fight with all my might!”</p><p>Mo Xingdao's deep voice was tinged with bitterness.</p><p>Back then, the two Soul Formation cultivators had given him two choices: either merge his soul with the puppet or force his way through the heavenly tribulation.  He chose the latter.</p><p>Even if he became a half-puppet, it was better than merging with a puppet.</p><p>With the tribulation-crossing secret technique, the protection of his Natal Puppet, high-grade Soul Calming Incense, and the full assistance of the human and demon race kings, Mo Xingdao defied the heavens and succeeded in his tribulation!</p><p>Mo Xingdao was the only person Qin Sang knew, besides himself, who had successfully overcome the tribulation under the threat of the Heavenly Dao’s Demonic Sound, and he hadn’t had the Jade Buddha’s protection.</p><p>However, Mo Xingdao hadn't anticipated that merging with a puppet seemed to be his destiny. He ultimately couldn't defy fate.</p><p>When he was thrown into this realm, he was used by the Azure Fox Saint King.  His Natal Puppet shielded him from a fatal blow, nearly turning to dust. He barely managed to salvage a bit of its core essence, which took a century to recover to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Placing his Natal Puppet by Qin Sang's side and splitting off a sliver of his soul was merely a precaution, but the unexpected truly happened.</p><p>Only, the unexpected came not from Hong Yuzi, but from the Azure Fox Saint King.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, unsure what to say.</p><p>In his heart, he admired Mo Xingdao, an admiration similar to that he felt for Wisdom Pool Master from the Western Lands. Knowing the path was treacherous, he still defied the heavens, and he actually succeeded.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's aura gradually stabilized, sinking into unprecedented weakness.  He looked at the silent Qin Sang, "Fellow Daoist Qin, what do you plan to do next?”</p><p>“You want to use me to take revenge?”</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao said indifferently, "My millennia of cultivation is almost gone. How could I possibly utilize Fellow Daoist?  If you choose to avoid this conflict, I will naturally help you obtain the Five Elements Crown in exchange for a place to hide, endure humiliation, and plan for the future!"</p><p>Qin Sang was also pondering.</p><p>If the two demons succeeded in their ambush and killed Mo Xingdao, would they continue to fight to the death with Hong Yuzi?</p><p>According to Mo Xingdao, Hong Yuzi was unfathomable and still capable of fighting. Judging by the two demons' arrangements on the battlefield, their intent seemed more to trap than to kill.</p><p>Of course, it was also possible that the Azure Fox Saint King wanted to control Mo Xingdao first, then focus on dealing with Hong Yuzi.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, do you think the Azure Fox Saint King has found the Five Elements Crown?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked thoughtfully.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's eyes flickered.  He was the last one to see the Five Elements Crown, but the Azure Fox Saint King's ability to ambush them here, with such precise timing, indicated her familiarity with this place. She must have been here more than once.</p><p>Perhaps she had already found the Five Elements Crown!</p><p>Qin Sang said faintly, "Fellow Daoist mentioned before that in the Storm Realm, the demonic soul of the Five Elements Crown was about to lose control.  Over the past century, the demonic soul has gradually fused with the Ancient Devil, and it's not what it used to be.  Coupled with the threat within the illusion, I'm afraid it won't be easy to obtain..."</p><p>"Are you saying, the Azure Fox Saint King wants to..."</p><p>Mo Xingdao guessed what Qin Sang was implying.</p><p>Perhaps he wasn't the Azure Fox Saint King's true target, merely incidental.</p><p>"If she has found the Five Elements Crown, why wouldn't she try to take it herself? Why lure a late-stage Soul Formation demon cultivator, ambush you and Hong Yuzi upon your arrival, trigger a great battle, all just to subdue you?"</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed, "Moreover, with that fox demon's temperament, would she hand over a readily available treasure to someone else?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao's emotions were complex.</p><p>He had been with the Azure Fox Saint King day and night, and he knew her too well.  Qin Sang's speculation was likely true.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King hadn't taken him seriously, treating him as merely a pawn.</p><p>“We’ll find the Five Elements Crown first!"</p><p>Qin Sang declared decisively, immediately changing direction. He sneered, "If that fox demon hasn't found the Five Elements Crown, we’ll obtain the treasure first, then go to the battlefield and reap the benefits.  Hong Yuzi should be able to hold on for a while. Otherwise, there should be a good show to watch!"</p><p>…</p><p>On the battlefield.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King clutched Mo Xingdao’s corpse.  Sensing that all life force within was gone, she snorted and brazenly broke open his storage pouch, scattering treasures across the ground.</p><p>Glancing over them, the Azure Fox Saint King immediately transmitted to Xiahou: "The key isn't on him!"</p>
