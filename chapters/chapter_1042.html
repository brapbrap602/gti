<h1>Chapter 1334:  A Scheme</h1><p>“Master!”</p><p>“Master Ye!”</p><p>As the clouds dispersed and the thunder subsided, the old man landed before them.  Everyone came to their senses and quickly bowed.</p><p>The newcomer was Master Ye, a renowned figure in the Eastern Extremity Alliance, highly trusted by the Alliance Leader. He was responsible for training the rising stars of the Merchant Alliance.  Everyone present, including Su Nu, had received guidance from Master Ye and respected him as their master.</p><p>No one noticed the deepening gloom in Su Nu's eyes.</p><p>Master Ye had actually snuck in here!</p><p>What exactly was the Merchant Alliance plotting?</p><p>Master Ye closed his eyes, sheathed his sword, and then his aura fluctuated as he performed some secret technique, becoming almost imperceptible, though not entirely suppressed. He had self-limited his cultivation.</p><p>Scanning the group, Master Ye frowned. “Why are there only a few of you?”</p><p>An elder with a long beard stepped forward and replied respectfully, “Master, Third Junior Brother was delayed at the second stage, the Xuanbing Plain. Left Junior Brother entered the final trial with us, but for some reason, he hasn't appeared. He might have encountered some trouble and been trapped…”</p><p>“Unable to even pass the Xuanbing Plain? Don't even mention receiving my guidance after leaving!”</p><p>Master Ye snorted coldly, then said indifferently, “Very well, if they can't even pass this test, they lack the destined fortune! Erase all traces here. Let's go get the Soul-Washing Liquid.”</p><p>Master Ye's tone was nonchalant, as if the Soul-Washing Liquid was already in his possession.</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone was startled, then overjoyed.</p><p>After seeing Master Ye, they had been speculating about his purpose in sneaking into this place.</p><p>Learning that Master Ye intended to take them to retrieve the Soul-Washing Liquid, they were all incredibly surprised.</p><p>Originally, even if they joined forces, while they had a good chance of obtaining the Soul-Washing Liquid, it was uncertain how many portions they could get.  Cultivators from both righteous and demonic paths, as well as those from other factions, were all formidable opponents.</p><p>Each person receiving a portion of the Soul-Washing Liquid was virtually impossible.</p><p>But with Master Ye's intervention, it was a different story.</p><p>A Nascent Soul Grandmaster, renowned throughout the Canglang Sea, a Merchant Alliance尊者, competing for the Soul-Washing Liquid with Foundation Establishment cultivators – it would be a simple task.</p><p>“Master, did you come specifically to help us obtain the Soul-Washing Liquid?”</p><p>A charming woman's large eyes blinked, unable to conceal her elation, her voice sweetly naive.</p><p>Master Ye chuckled, “Do you know the price the Alliance Leader and the Merchant Alliance paid to get me in here? Obtaining the Soul-Washing Liquid is merely incidental.  With such a treasure before us, how could we not take it? After we get the Soul-Washing Liquid, there’s something even more important to do.”</p><p>The charming woman gasped, a hint of worry in her eyes. “Master, what important task did the Alliance Leader send you on? Won't it be dangerous?”</p><p>“The most dangerous part is over…”</p><p>Master Ye recalled his perilous journey through the radiant light, still feeling apprehensive. Not only had the protective treasures the Merchant Alliance prepared for him been completely destroyed, but he himself had also suffered severe injuries.</p><p>That was just at the edge of the radiant light; he couldn't imagine the true power of the immortal restriction.</p><p>Pausing, Master Ye surveyed the surroundings. “It seems there was quite a commotion here! It's not convenient for me to act freely here. We need to plan carefully when we take the Soul-Washing Liquid later. Let's leave this place to avoid being discovered.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Everyone erased their traces and followed Master Ye as they flew out of the deep valley, evading others.</p><p>A short while later…</p><p>Streams of escaping light sped towards the valley.</p><p>They saw the devastated valley, exchanging bewildered glances.</p><p>Their search yielded nothing, and they gradually dispersed.</p><p>On a mountain not far from the stone peak…</p><p>Ming Wei had already arrived, seeing the mark left by Qin Sang, she hurried over to join him.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the edge of a flying peak, gazing at the valley, his brow furrowed.</p><p>The valley…</p><p>When Master Ye teleported in, the sky above the trial ground was filled with wind and clouds, thunder and lightning, as if divine punishment had descended. The mountain beasts went wild, and the cultivators were filled with apprehension.</p><p>The disturbance was most intense in the direction of the deep valley.</p><p>The anomaly came quickly and left just as quickly.</p><p>Soon, the trial ground was calm and returned to normal.</p><p>But for some reason, Qin Sang felt a lingering unease.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Ming Wei, has this kind of anomaly ever appeared in the trial ground before?” Qin Sang turned to ask.</p><p>Ming Wei stood beside Qin Sang. She was completely refreshed, having easily passed the final trial.</p><p>She shook her head slightly, confidently stating, “Never! In our sect, more than one senior has participated.  My master entered the trial ground before forming a Nascent Soul and obtained a portion of the Soul-Washing Liquid. A hundred years ago, a senior brother of mine came to the inner hall alone. Though he didn't get the Soul-Washing Liquid, he successfully passed the final trial, and neither of them encountered this kind of anomaly.”</p><p>"Hopefully, it's not related to the Soul Cleansing Liquid," Qin Sang sighed softly.</p><p>Ming Wei disagreed.  "That place is very far from where the Soul Cleansing Liquid appeared.  There shouldn't be any connection. Let's focus on how to ensure we get the Soul Cleansing Liquid without a hitch."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, looking away.  A short while ago, Ming Wei, as promised, had told him everything about the Soul Cleansing Liquid and the true function of the Life Talisman.</p><p>As they were discussing, a strange phenomenon interrupted them.  Recently, Qin Sang had seen many cultivators arriving and entering the stone peak, including disciples from the Heavenly Dao Sect, but Ning Wu Hui was conspicuously absent.</p><p>It seemed he could only rely on Ming Wei's cooperation.</p><p>The Life Talisman could be used three times within the Trial Realm. When activated in danger, it would connect with the restrictions within the realm, providing protection. Under its protection, opponents would immediately lose their target.  They couldn't see, couldn't sense, completely isolated from the inside and outside. It was like being in two different worlds.</p><p>The opponents encountered in the Trial Realm wouldn't be stronger than the Core Formation stage; they wouldn't be able to see through the Life Talisman. However, the Life Talisman wasn't without limitations. After activation, one could only stay in place and couldn't move anywhere. If trapped in a dangerous environment, it could only buy time at most.</p><p>Previously, Ming Wei had already used the Life Talisman once to escape, leaving two chances remaining.</p><p>As more cultivators gathered, the Soul Cleansing Liquid was about to appear.</p><p>The Soul Cleansing Liquid wasn't in the Hundred Treasures Pavilion. The Pavilion was built atop the stone peak, but the Soul Cleansing Liquid was hidden deep within an underground cavern.</p><p>"The cavern is about to open; let's go," Ming Wei said impatiently.</p><p>The two took to the air and flew north of the stone peak. Along the way, they deliberately separated, and Ming Wei changed her clothes to avoid being targeted because of the Life Talisman.</p><p>Deep in the mountains was a unique ring-shaped mountain. Compared to other peaks, it wasn't very high.  What was peculiar was the gathering of unusually cold, black mist, unlike anywhere else. Entering its range, one could feel a chill rising from the depths of one's being.</p><p>At that moment, scattered figures hovered around the ring-shaped mountain. They observed and guarded each other, occasionally glancing into the depths of the black mist, their eyes revealing eagerness and fervent desire.</p><p>Two individuals stood out. One wore a Daoist robe, a treasured sword at his waist, appearing handsome and elegant. The other was clad in a blood-red robe embroidered with a large, fanged blood bat, his face pale to an unsettling degree.</p>
