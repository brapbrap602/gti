<h1>Chapter 2269: The Dream Seed</h1><p>A soul contract, bound to the soul, cannot be broken unless the person who made it chooses to release it.  Even with unimaginable power, it cannot be undone.  It’s like with the Immortal Emperor, Little Yellow Chicken; even when he was just a God King, the Immortal Emperor couldn't break the contract. To prevent someone from breaking their vow and causing a backlash, the Masters' Continent established a rule: even if someone transcends the Heavenly Dao records, they cannot escape a soul contract!</p><p>“A soul contract can’t be severed from the mind, but I've absorbed a special energy that can even dissolve the Heavenly Dao. Breaking this contract isn't difficult… with enough power, bombarding the contract’s location will do the trick!”  the Ruthless One said.</p><p>A soul contract is based on the Heavenly Dao; a special power that can dissolve even the Heavenly Dao of the God Realm can easily dissolve a soul contract if handled properly.</p><p>“I see…” Zhang Xuan's eyes flickered.</p><p>“I’ve explained this much as thanks for bringing me to the God Realm!”</p><p>Having explained, the Ruthless One said no more.  Their aura grew increasingly ancient and distant, the black hole behind them expanding.  They seemed to be absorbing even more power, strengthening themselves with each passing moment.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan, the more the black hole absorbs, the stronger he gets…”</p><p>Luo Ruoxi sensed something was wrong and urgently transmitted her voice.</p><p>“Prepare to attack!”  With his doubts resolved, Zhang Xuan took a deep breath, raising his long sword. “Let's settle this!”</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>His most powerful sword intent erupted once more.</p><p>To live, to return; to die, to yearn.  Life and death hold no fear, what can stop me now?</p><p>While this sword technique hadn’t reached the level of an Immortal Emperor’s understanding, it contained all his resolve, pushing his Heavenly Compassion cultivation to its limits.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>With one strike, he cleaved the Ruthless One's attack in two.</p><p>At the same time, Luo Ruoxi attacked, her jade hand weaving, sword light like snow.  Her swordsmanship was similar to that young man from the Sword God Heaven, possessing an unstoppable momentum and natural elegance.</p><p>“Your moves are impressive, but compared to me, they fall short…”</p><p>With a light smile, the Ruthless One struck again.  In an instant, the attack was overwhelming, their hand engulfing the heavens and earth, shattering space, and threatening to bring down the sun, moon, and stars.</p><p>*Pfft!* *Pfft!*</p><p>Zhang Xuan and Luo Ruoxi were both sent flying, blood spurting from their mouths.  They couldn't withstand the attack, despite their strength.</p><p>What level of cultivation had this person reached?</p><p>“Audacious!”  The clone strode forward, each step blooming a lotus, the sound of flowing water echoing in the void.  It was quite impressive from afar.</p><p>After refining the Nine Heavens Chaotic Golden Lotus, his cultivation was no weaker than Zhang Xuan's.</p><p>He threw a punch, the force soaring to the heavens.</p><p>Clashing with the Ruthless One, he too was sent flying, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p>Zhang Xuan held his forehead. Even after becoming an Immortal Emperor, his clone still couldn't resist showing off…  Such flashy displays were less effective than concentrating power for a greater impact!</p><p>“Attack together, or we'll all die if they die…”</p><p>Little Yellow Chicken roared, crimson flames burning, igniting the sky.</p><p>The remaining six Immortal Emperors also unleashed their powers.</p><p>Seven Immortal Emperors united, their attack devastating, capable of destroying a world, but their opponent was the Ruthless One, empowered by special energy. As the attack neared, the black hole expanded rapidly, swallowing the power in an instant and counterattacking immediately.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The seven Immortal Emperors, like Zhang Xuan and the others, were sent flying.</p><p>Ten Immortal Emperors, joined together, were unable to withstand a single blow!</p><p>How could this person be so strong?</p><p>“You may die now…”</p><p>After defeating everyone with one blow, the Ruthless One stepped forward, their wrist turning, and struck again.</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>With a roar, the elder from Sword God Heaven suddenly appeared, blocking the attack, his long sword transforming into a silver river.</p><p>“An Immortal Emperor? He’s also an Immortal Emperor?”</p><p>Zhang Xuan's pupils constricted.  This elder had followed the young man, and Zhang Xuan had assumed him to be just a follower, at most a titled God King.  Only after witnessing his power did he realize that he was also an Immortal Emperor!</p><p>If he was an Immortal Emperor, then what was the young man?</p><p>“He is an Immortal Emperor of Sword God Heaven…” Luo Ruoxi said gritting her teeth, struggling to stand.</p><p>“Then…the young man who taught me swordsmanship?” Zhang Xuan couldn’t contain his curiosity.</p><p>“He is…” Luo Ruoxi was about to answer when space twisted, revealing the Sword God Heaven Immortal Emperor sent flying, crashing into a large crater.</p><p>Zhang Xuan's current strength and understanding of the sword dao far surpassed his own, yet he still couldn't resist. Even with strong cultivation and superb swordsmanship, he was no match.</p><p>"Haha, Emperor!  They're nothing but a pack of weaklings! Today, I destroy the Nine Heavens, destroy this divine realm, and crush all its rules!"</p><p>The villain, having defeated the Emperor of Jian Shen Tian, laughed maniacally.  Space around him constantly collapsed, making him look demonic and monstrous.</p><p>"What do we do?" Zhang Xuan clenched his fists.</p><p>He and his clone had unleashed their full power, and even Luo Ruoxi had used her strongest attack, yet they couldn't withstand a single blow…</p><p>Could it be that no one in the divine realm could stop him?  Just let him destroy the world?</p><p>"The only way… is to return the flawed fragment of Heaven's Way back to its whole, allowing Heaven's Way to suppress him…" Luo Ruoxi clenched her fists, her eyes reddening.</p><p>"Return it to its whole?" Zhang Xuan understood.</p><p>The library in his mind was part of Heaven's Way. If it returned, Heaven's Way would be complete, perhaps fixing the flaw and repelling the villain.  Like a human's immune system.</p><p>A complete immune system easily repels viruses; a broken one can't resist, even the strongest person dies.</p><p>But…</p><p>"He's too powerful, even if Heaven's Way is restored, it can't suppress him!" Zhang Xuan shook his head.</p><p>The immune system can kill viruses, but… a tiger? Even the strongest immune system is helpless. This villain, though just a regular God King, even with his title, Heaven's Way could easily kill him. Yet, he's stronger than any Emperor… beyond what Heaven's Way can handle.</p><p>"That…" Luo Ruoxi paused, a look of despair on her beautiful face. "Yes… we can't suppress him, but with Heaven's Way whole, *he* can awaken and kill this villain; it won't be difficult!"</p><p>"He?" Zhang Xuan frowned.</p><p>"I'll take you to him, in Zi Zai Tian…" Taking a deep breath, Luo Ruoxi gritted her teeth and flew forward.</p><p>"Trying to escape?" The villain sneered, striking down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Luo Ruoxi fell from the sky.</p><p>"You…" Zhang Xuan unleashed his swordsmanship again, brilliant sword intent erupting.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>He was blocked again.</p><p>"Go! I'll hold him off…"</p><p>Knowing they needed to find another way to save the divine realm, not escape, the clone and the Immortal Emperor shouted, blocking the villain's path. Luo Qiqi transformed back into her Jing Kong Pearl form.</p><p>Space around them solidified.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Seeing everyone fearlessly blocking him, Zhang Xuan's eyes welled up.  But he knew there was no time to talk. He grabbed Luo Ruoxi, space rippled, and they appeared in Zi Zai Tian.</p><p>Zi Zai Tian was no longer peaceful. The divine realm was collapsing, chaos everywhere.</p><p>"Where's the person you mentioned?"</p><p>Too busy to observe the common people, Zhang Xuan looked at the girl in his arms.  If this person could save the divine realm, what did his own sacrifice matter!</p><p>"He's my father. The blood in your pendant is his. The Immortal Emperor was once his beast pet…" Luo Ruoxi explained after catching her breath.</p><p>"Your father?"</p><p>Zhang Xuan suddenly understood.</p><p>He'd always felt the blood in the pendant was similar to Luo Ruoxi's yet different.  It was her father's.  That explained why the Immortal Emperor's remaining consciousness immediately recognized him as its master upon seeing the pendant.</p><p>"Your father is also an Emperor? Or even stronger?"</p><p>He couldn't help but ask.</p><p>The library's chaos; it was the blood in the pendant that allowed him to regain clarity. Could it be that not only was she the child of an Emperor, but her father was one too, perhaps even stronger?  If so, why was he unconscious? Why did he need the flawed piece of Heaven's Way to awaken?</p><p>"He's not an Emperor, he's… Heaven's Way!"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi clenched her fists.</p><p>"Heaven's Way? Your father… is Heaven's Way?" Zhang Xuan was shocked, disbelieving.</p><p>"Yes! Fifty years ago, Father couldn't withstand that great hand, falling into a coma. Heaven's Way scattered into three parts: Ordered Heaven's Way and Flawed Heaven's Way went into the spatial currents. I took over Natural Heaven's Way, maintaining the balance of the divine realm. To restore him, I need to gather the scattered parts… That's why I'm so determined, I can't fail! That's why I entered the Master's Continent, studied the Spring and Autumn Annals, and sought a way to defeat Kong Shi! When I fought Kong Shi, that's also what I asked of him."</p><p>Luo Ruoxi explained.</p><p>Zhang Xuan understood.</p><p>He'd met this girl recently in the Master's Continent; she'd told him her story, about saving a loved one.  He hadn't understood then, but now he did.  It was her father, and he was the Heaven's Way of the divine realm!</p><p>Could Heaven's Way really take human form, have children?</p><p>"Controlling Natural Heaven's Way… you don't have a fragment of Heaven's Way within you?"  Suddenly realizing something was off in her words, Zhang Xuan looked at her.</p><p>Controlling it from outside and having it integrated within oneself are two different concepts.</p><p>“I merely control it; I’m not a part of the Heavenly Dao…” Luo Ruoxi said.</p><p>Zhang Xuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>This meant he only needed to separate the Heavenly Dao flaw from her; he didn’t need her to die.</p><p>Although he didn’t want to accept this fate, he also didn’t want the girl before him to be harmed.</p><p>“If I separate the Heavenly Dao flaw within me, your father will live, and we can even kill the Ruthless One, right?” Zhang Xuan asked.</p><p>“That… I’m not sure…”</p><p>Looking up at the already collapsed Divine Realm, Luo Ruoxi hesitated.</p><p>The Divine Realm was her father’s foundation. Now that the foundation was gone, even if he woke up, could he really defeat that powerful Ruthless One?</p><p>It was hard to say!</p><p>“It seems you can’t be certain either. In that case, relying on others is futile… We have to find our own way!” Zhang Xuan gritted his teeth. “You, me, my clone, along with the Nine Heavens Nine Emperors, and if we can get Kong Shi to join us, we might have a chance of winning!”</p><p>“Kong Shi? He…” Luo Ruoxi frowned.</p><p>“Kong Shi is dead, you say! He isn’t truly dead. If I’m not wrong, his death at your hands was just a method to escape the Heavenly Dao…  He should be, like Wei Changfeng, a Primordial Soul Body!”</p><p>Zhang Xuan said.</p><p>Seeing Wei Changfeng had given him the answer: Kong Shi’s ability to retain his consciousness was likely due to being a Primordial Soul Body.</p><p>Able to remain lucid even before birth.</p><p>With the preparations he made beforehand, resurrection was only a matter of time.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was stunned; she hadn’t expected this.</p><p>“Let’s go check. If my guess is right, he should have already recovered. Otherwise, his students wouldn’t have stayed away from the Tidal Sea…” Zhang Xuan said.</p><p>Kong Shi’s students, Zi Yuan Gu Sheng and the others, were all incredibly strong. Even without the Emperor’s help, they would certainly have a way to enter the Tidal Sea, but none of them appeared.</p><p>There must be something more important they were waiting for, something to be done while all the Emperors were preoccupied at the Tidal Sea!</p><p>And that important thing was clearly Kong Shi’s recovery.</p><p>“This…” Luo Ruoxi was shocked, suddenly understanding.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without further explanation, with a sweep of his hand, Zhang Xuan reappeared at Kong Shi’s residence.  There, he saw an old man levitating cross-legged in the air.  Seeing them arrive, he smiled slightly: “You’ve come!”</p><p>If it wasn’t Kong Shi, who else could it be!</p><p>This teacher of all ages had indeed not disappointed him!</p><p>Just as he had guessed, he had resurrected while everyone’s attention was focused on the Tidal Sea.</p><p>“You…” Luo Ruoxi’s body trembled.</p><p>She knew Emperors could be resurrected—the Immortal Emperor had come back to life—but… she hadn’t expected it to be this fast!</p><p>“I concealed it from the Heavenly Dao and made preparations beforehand. The nameless giant in the Nether Soul Pool was my creation. When you killed him, I used the opportunity to break free from the Heavenly Dao's constraints and reconstitute my physical body. I’ve only just recovered.”</p><p>Kong Shi smiled faintly.</p><p>He was adept at manipulating time. It seemed like only one or two days had passed in the Divine Realm, but he had actually spent an unknown amount of time recovering his strength.</p><p>It could have been decades.</p><p>“The three of us are strong, but defeating the Ruthless One won’t be easy…”</p><p>Seeing that Kong Shi had truly recovered, Luo Ruoxi still shook her head.</p><p>This wasn’t about being pessimistic; it was a matter of fact.</p><p>Even with so many people working together earlier, they hadn’t been able to stop the opponent.  Adding Kong Shi wouldn't change much.</p><p>It wouldn't change the situation at all!</p><p>“Individually, or even together, we are no match for the opponent. But… what if we combined everyone’s power into a single person?”</p><p>Kong Shi looked over, smiling.</p><p>“Combine it into one person?”</p><p>This time, not only Luo Ruoxi frowned, but Zhang Xuan was also puzzled.</p><p>“That hand could tear apart the Divine Realm and scatter the Heavenly Dao. Its power is undeniable. The Ruthless One absorbed all that power, and consumed fifty years' worth of the Divine Realm's spiritual energy.  In terms of pure strength, even individually, the dozen or so Emperors are no match for him…”</p><p>Kong Shi said: “But combined, concentrating the power into one person… that might be different!”</p><p>“How do we concentrate it?”</p><p>Luo Ruoxi looked over.</p><p>It was easy to say, but hard to do.</p><p>The Emperors were already at the pinnacle of the Divine Realm. If it were that easy to absorb others’ power, she wouldn’t have stagnated for so many years.</p><p>“It’s simple… We concentrate our power into Zhang Xuan. Once he breaks through the Emperor’s shackles, he can save the Divine Realm!”</p><p>Kong Shi said.</p><p>"Me?" Zhang Xuan was startled. "Why me?"</p><p>"Lingxi Emperor cultivated freedom and transcendence! But with the constraints of his father and Heaven's Will, and with loved ones, he can never truly transcend! If I'm not mistaken, when you fought me before, you also gave up, intending to be killed by me!"  Kong Shi said.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was speechless.</p><p>During the battle, she had indeed considered that, so their initial engagement was more like sparring than a life-or-death struggle.</p><p>"Unable to transcend, naturally one cannot unleash their full power. Even with more true energy, one cannot break through to the highest realm! As for me..."</p><p>Kong Shi nodded.  "I care for all beings, wishing to save the world, yet unwilling to have others sacrifice for me. Too much kindness is also a flaw! If I had been ruthless, and annihilated the Yiling people, we wouldn't be in this situation…"</p><p>If the Yiling had been exterminated, the Ruthless One wouldn't have resurrected, and this wouldn't be happening.</p><p>"Therefore, I'm also unsuitable! But Zhang Xuan, your cultivation method is harmonious, without flaws. It emphasizes living authentically; even if you die, as long as you live without regrets, your heart is at peace. Such a person possesses greater tolerance and potential for growth; only this way can you go higher and further!" Kong Shi continued.</p><p>To live is to return, to die is to yearn endlessly.</p><p>Someone who doesn't fear death, won't be shackled by other things.</p><p>"This…" Zhang Xuan frowned, about to speak, when he saw Kong Shi's intense gaze: "Don't refuse. Even if we had time to train others, I don't think anyone could do better than you.  While the Lingxi Emperor doesn't possess a Heaven's Will fragment, he controlled Heaven's Will for years and has his own understanding of it; I control the orderly Heaven's Will. If we infuse our power into you, you will possess the complete power of Heaven's Will! Combined with the Nine Heavens Chaos Golden Lotus of your clone, you can truly stabilize the nine heavens, control the universe, battle the nine skies, and destroy all things!"</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Seeing the other party had made up their mind, further explanations were useless, so Zhang Xuan nodded.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Sitting cross-legged, in the blink of an eye, two powerful forces surged in from both sides.</p><p>Zhang Xuan's body stiffened; he felt as though he had instantly transformed into Heaven's Will, soaring above the nine heavens.</p><p>His soul, body, and true energy were instantly purified, growing stronger and more powerful.</p><p>…</p><p>"You also want to stop me? Fine, I'll kill you, then kill Zhang Xuan…"</p><p>After sending Luo Qiqi and his clone flying, the Ruthless One sneered coldly.</p><p>The combined power of the clone and numerous Emperors was indeed powerful, but compared to him, it was still weak.</p><p>The Tide Sea had absorbed almost all the spiritual energy outside the city in the Divine Realm; now, this energy nourished him, his every move possessing the power to destroy the world. These Emperors and Divine Kings, though representing the pinnacle of the Divine Realm, were still no match.</p><p>At this moment, the Ruthless One seemed to represent the entire Divine Realm, unstoppable.</p><p>"The Divine Realm is destroyed; it's meaningless for us to live. I, Yun Chi, will perish with you…"</p><p>Yun Chi Emperor transformed into his true form, a huge five-clawed golden dragon, pouncing towards him.</p><p>"You? Not worthy!"</p><p>The Ruthless One squeezed his hand, trapping the golden dragon in his palm; it struggled in vain.</p><p>"Old friend, wait for me!"</p><p>Fu Meng Emperor roared, transforming into his white tiger form and charging forward.</p><p>The Undying Emperor manifested his Undying Fire Phoenix form, its flames illuminating the sky.</p><p>Xuan Ming Emperor, whose true form was a giant tortoise, seemed to support the heavens.</p><p>The Four Divine Beasts, guarding the four corners of the Divine Realm, simultaneously transformed into their true forms, slowing the collapse of the Divine Realm.</p><p>Time and space seemed to freeze.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>With four consecutive strikes, the Ruthless One suppressed the four beasts, a strong killing intent flashing in his eyes: "Since you seek death, I shall grant it…"</p><p>As he roared and was about to kill them all, he felt his raised arm tighten, stopping mid-air.</p><p>"Want to kill them? Ask me first…"</p><p>Then, to the shocked gazes of everyone, a figure slowly descended from the sky.</p><p>It was Zhang Xuan!</p><p>The young man's power surged, ten times stronger than before, descending from the heavens, like a world unto himself.</p><p>"Improved considerably…"</p><p>The Ruthless One stopped, his gaze solemn.</p><p>He clearly didn't understand how, in just a few minutes, the other party's strength had changed so drastically.</p><p>"But, what difference does it make? Even the Divine Realm at its peak couldn't withstand me. I don't believe you can stop me…"</p><p>With a cold snort, the Ruthless One struck again.</p><p>Zhang Xuan raised his sword and met the attack.</p><p>As they battled, space tore apart, and air currents raged.</p><p>Could Zhang Xuan win?</p><p>Luo Ruoxi, stationed at Kong Shi's base, watched anxiously.</p><p>She and Kong Shi had transferred their power to Zhang Xuan, reducing their own cultivation to the God King level, far less glorious than before.  However, their level remained, and with enough power, they would eventually recover.</p><p>"With his current strength, winning is… difficult! Unless… he can grasp power beyond the Emperor Jun level!" Kong Shi said after a moment of silence.</p><p>Even a dozen Emperor Juns combined couldn't defeat the Ruthless One. Even if they transferred all their power, victory wouldn't be easy.  They did this because… only by concentrating power in one person could they possibly reach the pinnacle, truly transcend their limits, and break through!</p><p>"Power beyond the Emperor Jun level?" Luo Ruoxi's gaze drifted.  Her father, while still alive, had spoken of the same thing, but… she couldn't achieve it. Could the man she loved?</p><p>"He will… He has an indomitable spirit! And a proud defiance of the world." Kong Shi smiled, seeing her question.</p><p>…</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After several consecutive strikes, Zhang Xuan's knuckles cracked, and a huge, horrific scar appeared on his chest.  As Kong Shi had said, even with their combined power, forming a complete Heavenly Dao within him, he was still no match.</p><p>"Haha, I thought you were mighty, but you're nothing!" The Ruthless One sneered coldly.</p><p>"I'm no match for you anyway, I'll be killed sooner or later.  Since that's the case, I want to die under your strongest attack…"  Taking a deep breath, Zhang Xuan stopped attacking and looked at the Ruthless One.</p><p>"Fine, I'll grant you that, my strongest attack…"</p><p>Hearing this, the Ruthless One paused, then snorted coldly, raising his hand.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A green light appeared in his palm and slammed down.</p><p>It was indeed his strongest attack. The entire divine realm rumbled, as if it couldn't bear the impact, another massive crater appearing.</p><p>With his eyes closed, Zhang Xuan didn't dodge.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>His head exploded, his soul scattering.</p><p>"Zhang Xuan…"  Everyone's faces turned pale at this sight.</p><p>Luo Qiqie seemed to go mad.</p><p>Yun Chi Dadi and the others also widened their eyes, trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi were also stunned.</p><p>Their intention was for him to break his shackles and strive for a realm beyond the Emperor Jun, but why didn't he resist? Why did he willingly die? Wasn't this a betrayal of their good intentions?</p><p>"No, it's the Immortal Emperor's immortal technique…"</p><p>Just as they wondered, Kong Shi suddenly spoke.</p><p>Everyone then saw that Zhang Xuan, whose head had exploded and whose soul had shattered, had his chest pendant suddenly explode. A drop of blood hovered, ignited, forming a blazing flame. Within the flames, an unharmed figure slowly emerged.</p><p>"He… used the opponent's power and the blood in the pendant to separate the flawed Heavenly Dao and his soul?" Luo Ruoxi's pupils constricted.</p><p>The reborn Zhang Xuan had no Heavenly Dao Library, no Heavenly Dao interference; he was free from the Heavenly Dao!</p><p>"How did he do it?" Kong Shi was incredulous.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao and soul were fused, inseparable. To break free, he had to shatter his soul and use the Nether Soul Pool to reconstitute it.  This one, however, was simply killed once, and then completely freed himself. How?</p><p>"I know… he used the Ruthless One's method of breaking the soul contract…" Luo Ruoxi realized.</p><p>A soul contract bound master and servant; unless the master released it, the servant would forever be controlled… The Heavenly Dao Library was the same, an enhanced contract.  Bound to the soul, one couldn't escape without dying.</p><p>But… the Ruthless One used a special power to break the soul contract. Zhang Xuan had inquired about the specific method beforehand, and likely had a plan in mind then.</p><p>That's why he deliberately fought to the death, allowing the Ruthless One to unleash his strongest attack.  Using this power, he was reborn from the flames, and unexpectedly, succeeded greatly!</p><p>"So that's it, that's the way to surpass the Emperor Jun…"</p><p>Zhang Xuan, emerging from the flames, smiled faintly, as if understanding something. He gestured, and a clone to his side instantly transformed back into a lotus flower and flew over, merging perfectly with himself.</p><p>In an instant, everyone felt that Zhang Xuan had become the Nine Heavens, and the Nine Heavens were him.</p><p>He lightly tapped his foot on the ground.</p><p>The chaotic Nine Heavens instantly stabilized.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Primordial Golden Lotus, born at the dawn of the Nine Heavens, stabilized the realm.  With its integration, Zhang Xuan's self and his manifestation became one, granting him mastery over its power.</p><p>Furthermore, the cultivation he achieved by merging with the Lotus reached its peak, now poised for a breakthrough.</p><p>“Master-servant bond, brotherhood, teacher-student bond, parental love, romantic love… merging them together reveals the essence of all things, and what it means to be human!”</p><p>A smile played on Zhang Xuan's lips as he murmured to himself.  The moment the Heavenly Dao Library separated from his soul, he understood.</p><p>Do people create the world, or does the world create people?  Is it the wind that moves, or the heart?</p><p>This timeless question had plagued countless individuals.  But now… it was inconsequential.</p><p>A world without life, without emotion, held no meaning.  Thus, beyond romantic love lay universal empathy—the interwoven emotions of the world.</p><p>All things possess emotion; emotion gives rise to the world, and sustains life.</p><p>Love is emotion.</p><p>Hate is emotion.</p><p>Joy is emotion.</p><p>Suffering is emotion.</p><p>Parting is emotion.</p><p>Reunion is also emotion!</p><p>“All emotions, at my command…”</p><p>With a low cry, the barrier to his advancement shattered.  The Emperor's shackles were broken!</p><p>Instantly, he touched a new world, a new door, his soul nourished. Countless chaotic energies surged in, his body rapidly strengthening.  Before, he had relied solely on absorbing spiritual energy; now, spatial turbulence, chaotic energies, even the opponent's green light—all became his to command.</p><p>“You…” Hen Ren, unable to believe that her full-powered attack had not killed him but instead empowered him, cried out in rage, launching another attack.</p><p>“Your resentment towards the high and mighty Emperors for not saving you in the spatial turbulence is emotion; your sense of humiliation and anger as my former servant is emotion; your desire to destroy the Divine Realm to vent your anger is emotion; your desire for greater power is also emotion… Emotion controls you.  How can you overcome emotion, how can you escape my control?”</p><p>Smiling faintly, Zhang Xuan’s voice grew faster, louder.  With a gentle grasp of his hand, the once invincible Hen Ren was bound by countless threads of emotion, immobilized.</p><p>Any emotion would be used, controlled by him!</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Terror filled Hen Ren’s eyes:  “Master Zhang, I was your servant, please don’t kill me… I offer my soul as a sacrifice…”</p><p>“It’s too late for that…” Zhang Xuan smiled faintly, shaking his head.  Controlling the emotions of the world rendered the status of a servant meaningless.  He had slain so many god-level beings, harmed his girlfriend, Luo Qiqi, and numerous friends—forgiveness was impossible today.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Sensing his resolve, Hen Ren's pupils constricted. Before she could finish, a violent pain wracked her body.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In an instant, she exploded, transforming into countless spiritual energies that flooded the Divine Realm. The power previously consumed by the Tidal Sea surged back, revitalizing the barren lands.</p><p>“What…”</p><p>“She's… dead?”</p><p>Yun Chi Dadi, the Immortal Emperor, Linglong Xianzi, and others stared in disbelief. They had clashed with Hen Ren and knew her terrifying power. To effortlessly vanquish such a being… what realm had Zhang Xuan reached?  Was there truly a realm beyond the Emperor?</p><p>“He succeeded…”</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi unclenched their fists.</p><p>“This is a fragment of the Heavenly Dao; I’ll return it now…”</p><p>Seeing the “Incomplete Heavenly Dao,” previously separated from his body, still floating in the air, Zhang Xuan smiled gently and flicked a finger.</p><p>Whum!</p><p>The Library, his companion since his rebirth, embedded itself into the Divine Realm's sky.  A bell-like resonance echoed.  The crumbling Divine Realm visibly began to mend, the chaotic currents coalescing.  The collapse ceased; the depleted spiritual energy gradually revived with Hen Ren’s demise.</p><p>“It seems the Divine Realm is entering a new era of spiritual revival…” Zhang Xuan smiled. The Tidal Sea’s chasm, with the Heavenly Dao’s restoration, would heal; the Divine Realm’s former glory was merely a matter of time.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan, over here…”</p><p>A voice echoed in his mind.  Zhang Xuan paused, then took a step.  This step covered an immeasurable distance, revealing a young man standing before him—the one who had taught him swordsmanship.</p><p>“Senior, you…”</p><p>Zhang Xuan was taken aback.</p><p>I sensed his unfathomable depth before, but only now do I realize he's just a hair's breadth away from my own level, having reached the peak of the Emperor Sovereign realm. He's far stronger than Luo Ruoxi was.</p><p>"Just call me by my name. I'm... Nie Tong!" the young man said calmly, an unstoppable sword intent emanating from him.</p><p>"Nie Tong?" Zhang Xuan frowned.  He'd never heard the name before.</p><p>"Come with me. I'll take you to my brother!"  Nie Tong smiled gently and strode forward.</p><p>Zhang Xuan followed closely behind.  They flew for an unknown distance before stopping in front of a mountain peak.  There, he saw another young man.</p><p>He looked only slightly older, with raised eyebrows that gave him a deep, unreadable air.</p><p>"His strength…" Zhang Xuan gasped.  This young man's power surpassed even his own! He, too, had broken through the Emperor Sovereign barrier, his cultivation even deeper and more profound.</p><p>"I am Nie Yun," the young man smiled faintly, his gaze settling on Zhang Xuan. "And I am…  Nie Lingxi's father, the father you know as Luo Ruoxi's father."</p><p>"Ruoxi's father?" Zhang Xuan was stunned. "You… you are the Heavenly Dao of the God Realm?"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi had mentioned her father was the Heavenly Dao. He never imagined it would be such a young man.</p><p>"I transformed into three through one breath, a portion of my soul becoming the Heavenly Dao! Besides, I created this world, so calling me the Heavenly Dao isn't inaccurate," Nie Yun smiled calmly.</p><p>Zhang Xuan couldn't believe it. This man created the God Realm?  Just how strong was he?</p><p>"But if you created the God Realm and are the Heavenly Dao, why did you let the villains run rampant without intervening...?" Zhang Xuan asked, his gaze sharp.</p><p>If he hadn't broken through, the God Realm might have completely collapsed. Why did this man remain indifferent?  Did he not even care about his daughter's life or death?</p><p>Without answering, Nie Yun looked at him calmly.  "Do you think… there are even stronger beings above the God Realm?"</p><p>"That…" Zhang Xuan hesitated. "Probably…"</p><p>He'd never seen them, but if he could reach this level, others might have, even stronger ones.  Like this man before him.</p><p>"I once suspected the existence of stronger beings above the God Realm, so I used all my might to peer into the heavens, ultimately provoking a backlash from a higher world… a hand descended from the void!"</p><p>Nie Yun continued, "If I'd dodged, the entire God Realm would likely have been wiped out, leaving not a single living being… So I blocked the attack, but in doing so, the Heavenly Dao I embodied was split."</p><p>"Restoring myself is a mere thought, but… I understood that to truly transcend the God Realm's constraints, to explore the origin of that hand and what lies beyond… it would be difficult to accomplish alone.  So I wanted to see if any lifeforms could break through the Emperor Sovereign barrier and reach my level!"</p><p>"That's why I sent the scattered fragments of the Heavenly Dao's essence to the lowest realm… bestowing them upon souls originally belonging to this world, and one soul not from this world. And you, you didn't disappoint me!"</p><p>Nie Yun laughed.</p><p>"A soul not of this world?  So, my transmigration was your doing?"  Zhang Xuan was shocked.</p><p>So that was why he could cross over. It was all planned by this man.</p><p>"Hehe!" Nie Yun chuckled. "Those inherently from this world possess a reverence for it, making it much harder to break free. It was an impulse, I didn't expect you to actually succeed…"</p><p>"I…" Zhang Xuan blushed. "Without Master Kong, I never could have reached this level…"</p><p>Without Master Kong's selfless dedication, reaching this stage would have been impossible.</p><p>"I gave him the chance, but he didn't seize it.  His battle with Lingxi was the perfect opportunity for him to break through, but he chose to retreat. He thought he had a backup plan, that he could escape unscathed, but he lost his aggressive drive. When facing someone who surpasses us, if you lack this spirit, how can you contend with them?"</p><p>Nie Yun stated.</p><p>Zhang Xuan remained silent.  He'd witnessed their battle; Master Kong indeed lacked decisiveness.</p><p>Perhaps he didn't want to kill Luo Ruoxi.  Unfortunately, that hesitation cost him the chance to advance.</p><p>"If Master Kong had won, Ruoxi would have died…" After a moment, Zhang Xuan spoke, his brows furrowed.</p><p>Did this man not even care about his daughter's life or death?</p><p>"With me here, she wouldn't have died," Nie Yun smiled faintly. "Your strength is now nearly on par with mine.  Do you think, in a life-or-death situation, you could save someone given both their powers?"</p><p>"That…" Zhang Xuan chuckled wryly.</p><p>The Emperor's breakthrough and the Emperor himself are two different concepts. If he were truly willing to intervene, he could certainly save the person at the last moment, ensuring they wouldn't suffer a single scratch.</p><p>“Lingxi is my other wife, Luo Qingcheng's daughter.  That's why her alias uses the Luo surname... To make her believe I'm not swayed by emotion, she's been under the impression I'm still in a coma…”</p><p>Nie Yun gave a wry smile.  “I guess I've been a pretty ruthless father…  Look, you should explain this to her.  Her affections are already focused on you; I'm practically forgotten by my own daughter!  Haha, I'll disappear for a while. Otherwise, I'm afraid she'll turn the world upside down!”</p><p>Zhang Xuan's face twitched at his unreliable father.  He could only agree: “Fine…”</p><p>He had little choice. After all, he had taken his daughter.</p><p>“The Heavenly Dao Library is a manifestation of my will, my foundation, and my constraint.  You've managed to overcome this constraint through your own strength, demonstrating your abilities and potential. Your future is limitless. As her father, I'm relieved she's with you.”</p><p></p>
