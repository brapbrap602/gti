<h1>Chapter 377: The Black Dragon</h1><p>Chapter 377: The Black Dragon</p><p>“Roar! Roar!”</p><p>The earth trembled with the tiger’s roar.</p><p>Tiger-winged vultures, dozens of them, detected the disturbance.  They soared into the air, their cries echoing, a dark cloud rolling in, their demonic aura overwhelming.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed this, his expression shifting slightly. He withdrew the Yellow Sand Banner and hastily gathered the bodies of Kong Xin and the other man.</p><p>He had planned to capture Kong Xin alive and refine him into a corpse-soldier.  However, Yun Youzi was nearby, making open corpse refinement impossible.  He'd deployed the Yellow Sand Banner as a cover, hoping to find a chance to work undetected.</p><p>Unfortunately, the tiger-winged vultures' senses were too sharp.  Furthermore, Kong Xin had used some secret technique that made Qin Sang feel a sense of danger, forcing him to use the Ebony Sword to kill them both.</p><p>Yun Youzi reacted as swiftly as Qin Sang, summoning his Spirit Bamboo Airship.  They escaped on the airship, taking turns piloting, until they finally lost the vultures. They found a secluded spot and descended.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed out the bodies of Kong Xin and the cloaked man.  The cloaked man’s spine was shattered by the Black Dragon Stone; his upper body was a mangled mass. His body was severely damaged.  Kong Xin, on the other hand, was horribly mutilated, his dantian severely injured, making him unsuitable for corpse refinement.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of disappointment. He searched the corpses, opening their storage pouches and emptying their contents.</p><p>Yun Youzi took the blue-glowing sword. Qin Sang kept the Red Pill, the Cold Gold ore, and a few other useful items.  The rest was unremarkable.</p><p>However, two jade slips caught Qin Sang's eye.</p><p>Both contained maps, one from Kong Xin, the other from the cloaked man.</p><p>The cloaked man's map was incredibly valuable, detailing numerous hidden routes and safe locations within the second level of the Wuyaya Valley—far more detailed than the map from Tianfeng Tower.</p><p>Clearly, the cloaked man had spent considerable time in the Wuyaya Valley.</p><p>This map was extremely valuable, especially for them.</p><p>Yun Youzi was also delighted. He compared it to the Tianfeng Tower map, selecting a safer route that saved at least a day’s travel.</p><p>The other map came from Kong Xin's pouch.</p><p>Unlike the first, this map didn't focus on routes.  Instead, it meticulously detailed the various beasts inhabiting the Wuyaya Valley: herd sizes, territories, habits, and strengths.</p><p>Such detail required painstaking investigation.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered why Kong Xin had documented so much about the beasts.  Further searching revealed a demonic cultivation technique called the "Blood Transformation Scripture."  This explained it all.</p><p>The "Blood Transformation Scripture," a technique from some demonic sect, used the life essence of cultivators and beasts for cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang skimmed the scripture.  It offered rapid advancement by absorbing others' life essence, but this came at a cost: unstable foundations, chaotic energy, and a cultivation ceiling at the late Foundation Establishment stage.  The chances of Golden Core advancement were virtually nil.</p><p>Such a risk made the scripture unsuitable, even with its speed.  Without cultivating it, the associated abilities were useless, so Qin Sang put it aside.</p><p>Compared to the scripture, another entry on the map proved far more exciting: the lair of a black dragon, a peak Spirit Transformation stage beast!</p><p>This black dragon possessed confirmed dragon bloodline!</p><p>Qin Sang needed a peak Spirit Transformation stage dragon's essence to improve his Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman.  Another dragon essence would allow the talisman to surpass even false Golden Core cultivators, though still slower than true Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Since obtaining the talisman, Qin Sang had searched extensively, but dragons with a pure bloodline were extremely rare, let alone peak Spirit Transformation stage ones.  Even Mount Shao Hua had yielded no such information.</p><p>To his surprise, one was hiding in the Wuyaya Valley.</p><p>The black dragon's lair was in a hidden abyss on the second level, filled with countless ancient restrictions—an extremely dangerous place.</p><p>The black dragon rarely left its lair, so how Kong Xin discovered it remained a mystery.  According to Kong Xin’s notes, the dragon's familiarity with the abyss's restrictions meant even a powerful false Golden Core cultivator would struggle to gain an advantage.</p><p>The Abyss was riddled with powerful barriers and narrow passages, making it difficult for reinforcements to effectively attack.  The black蛟 (jiao) could easily escape if things went south.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that with her Ten Directions Netherworld Needles, she might stand a chance of capturing the black jiao at the False Core stage. Before that, unless she found another way, the chances were virtually nil.</p><p>Carefully putting away the jade slip, Qin Sang kept the black jiao in mind, planning to hunt and claim its soul when she was strong enough.</p><p>Kong Xin's incident was just a minor setback.</p><p>Yun Youzi couldn't help but chuckle at himself. His intention had been to avoid complications, prioritizing reaching their destination safely to obtain the healing herbs.</p><p>Who would have guessed that the guide they hired for security would turn out to be a treacherous individual?</p><p>At least they had secured the cold gold ore and other treasures, making the journey worthwhile. After cremating Kong Xin and his companion's bodies, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi restored themselves to peak condition and continued on their journey.</p><p>From the Tiger Wing Roc's nest to the second barrier, there were still dozens of miles to cover.  They proceeded cautiously, arriving at the barrier without incident.</p><p>Blocking their path was an otherworldly light that filled the sky and earth. This light, stretching infinitely in all directions, formed a wall of light, impeding their progress.</p><p>The light's color shifted constantly, like a celestial rainbow cascading down, vibrant and multifaceted.</p><p>The scene was incredibly beautiful, almost intoxicating.</p><p>However, this dazzling light was merely the outward manifestation of an ancient barrier, incredibly dangerous and responsible for the demise of countless cultivators.</p><p>The cultivation world had long established that this vast expanse of light originated from a single ancient barrier. One could only imagine the terrifying power it would unleash if triggered.</p><p>Fortunately, this ancient barrier was remarkably stable, largely unchanged over countless years.  The entry path discovered long ago remained safe.</p><p>Within the depths of the light, black fissures, like cracks in shattered glass, were faintly visible, crisscrossing in all directions.</p><p>The path to the second level was hidden within these fissures.</p><p>After surveying the surroundings and confirming the absence of danger, the two revealed themselves.</p><p>Only a few paths allowed safe passage through the ancient barrier.  At other times, there might have been fellow travelers. But due to the recent upheaval in the Wuyaya Valley, few cultivators with the ability to reach this point were present, minimizing any potential trouble.</p><p>Consulting his map, Yun Youzi pointed to the largest fissure, saying, "This is it!"</p>
