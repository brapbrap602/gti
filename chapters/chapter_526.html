<h1>Chapter 519: Ancestral Sacred Fire</h1><p>Chapter 519: Ancestral Sacred Fire</p><p>After a period of weeping, Shi Ying dried her tears.  Just as she was about to put the corpse-cultivation into the coffin, she suddenly remembered something. She opened the person's pouch and emptied its contents.</p><p>She found many strange items inside, their uses unknown.  Time was short, so without selecting, she put everything into her own pouch, then destroyed the other pouch.  She found a secluded spot, dug a hole, and buried Qin Sang and the coffin.</p><p>Shi Ying used her spiritual energy to reduce the swelling around her eyes and rushed to Qingyang Market Town to buy a new black coffin. She quickly returned to the burial site.</p><p>Seeing the corpse-cultivation still obediently in place, Shi Ying breathed a sigh of relief, moved it into the new coffin, and carried it on her back.</p><p>She had seen fellow disciples flaunting their corpse-cultivations within the sect, and the elders didn't seem to mind.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the Qingyang Demon Sect gate.</p><p>Whether Qingyang Demon Sect disciples or honored guests, flight was forbidden here; all must ascend and descend on foot as a sign of respect.</p><p>Shi Ying stepped onto the white jade steps, pressed her chest to calm herself, and quickly climbed the mountain.  She encountered some fellow disciples, some ascending, some descending. Some who recognized her were surprised to see her unexpectedly carrying a black coffin—a departure from her usual demeanor—but no one dared to ask.</p><p>Soon, the Qingyang Demon Sect gate was in sight.</p><p>A stele stood atop the mountain, bearing the inscription "Qingyang".</p><p>Two teams of young disciples stood guard on either side, their eyes sharp, vigilantly protecting the gate.</p><p>Seeing Shi Ying approaching, the disciples' eyes lit up, their postures becoming even straighter. As she drew closer, one young man mustered his courage and called out.</p><p>"Senior Sister Shi Ying, have you returned from your training?"</p><p>Shi Ying smiled at him before continuing on her way.</p><p>"Senior Sister Shi Ying smiled at me…"</p><p>The young man gazed痴痴 at Shi Ying's back until his captain kicked him hard.</p><p>Shi Ying paid them no mind; she was actually quite nervous. Maintaining her composure, she was about to enter the gate when she heard a familiar voice.</p><p>"Shi Ying?"</p><p>Shi Ying paused, turning to see an elderly man in a blue robe, who had appeared behind her without her noticing, frowning at her.</p><p>Shi Ying knew the old man. He was Yun Yi, a junior uncle in her sect. After breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage, he suffered a major calamity, sustaining severe injuries, and his cultivation plummeted, never to advance further.  His immortal path was hopeless, and he now served the sect in a minor capacity.</p><p>Since Shi Ying joined the sect as a child, Yun Yi had looked after her several times. Although Yun Yi's ability was limited and he couldn't offer much help, Shi Ying remained deeply grateful to him.</p><p>"Shi Ying greets Uncle Yun," Shi Ying bowed, her posture somewhat awkward due to the coffin on her back.</p><p>Yun Yi's frown deepened. He asked in a low voice, "Why have you also obtained a corpse-cultivation? Are you, like your fellow disciples, abandoning the immortal path and relying on external objects?"</p><p>"Disciple…"</p><p>Shi Ying hesitated, then came up with an excuse. "I'm going to the Wuyaya Valley to train alone soon, so I bought a corpse-cultivation for protection. I don't intend to pursue the corpse path."</p><p>Deceiving her kind benefactor weighed heavily on Shi Ying's conscience, but for revenge, she would do anything.</p><p>Yun Yi's expression softened slightly. He nodded. "That's good! If you go to Wuyaya Valley alone, be careful and don't venture too far. Also, you've now broken through to the twelfth layer of the Qi Refinement stage; you should prioritize establishing your foundation. Don't be obsessed with demonic and heretical practices, or you will deeply regret it! Go…"</p><p>"Yes, disciple understands."</p><p>Shi Ying bowed again and left.</p><p>Unbeknownst to her, someone else was even more anxious.</p><p>Qin Sang had suppressed her cultivation, so Yun Yi couldn't sense it. However, he couldn't fathom the intricacies of the Qingyang Demon Sect's protective mountain formation, and he didn't know whether the formation had any detection capabilities.</p><p>Theoretically, since he had transformed himself into a living corpse and possessed Shi Ying's soul mark, their auras were connected, as if they were one; he wasn't sure if they could evade detection.</p><p>Behind the "Qingyang" stele was a square stone platform, shrouded in mist. Flying down from the platform meant truly entering the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Shi Ying summoned her flying artifact, leaving the platform and entering the cloud sea.</p><p>Soon, she passed through the clouds.</p><p>Green mountains, blue waters, pavilions, and terraces, cascading waterfalls, red sun, and flying cranes—everywhere, the splendor of the immortal world unfolded before Shi Ying's eyes.</p><p>These sights were familiar to her.  She quickly spotted a distant mountain silhouette and flew towards it.</p><p>Once a prominent Yuan Ying cultivation ground, Qingyang Demon Sect boasted a vast expanse.  Mountains and rivers intertwined, creating a breathtaking landscape rivaling even the Shao Hua Mountains.</p><p>Shi Ying flew tirelessly, soaring over numerous mountain ranges, finally reaching the inner sect.  Security was significantly tighter here, with numerous patrolling disciples. She was stopped, but after presenting her sect token, she was allowed to proceed.</p><p>No one questioned her corpse refinement.</p><p>The journey was uneventful, and Qin Sang's tense nerves relaxed. Her disguise had worked; she had infiltrated the Qingyang Demon Sect!</p><p>The inner sect lay at the heart of Qingyang, featuring dozens of peaks of varying sizes and shapes, providing cultivation grounds for the sect's disciples. These peaks surrounded a colossal, towering peak.</p><p>Compared to this central peak, the eight mountains of the outer sect seemed dwarfed.  Even from the air, Shi Ying could only look up, witnessing its summit pierce the heavens.  Clouds swirled, thunder roared, and bolts of lightning crashed down, a breathtaking spectacle of raw power.</p><p>This was the legendary Shen Gang Peak!</p><p>Strangely, amidst the wind, clouds, and lightning, a deep green hue permeated the summit.  Even the lightning appeared tinged with the same color.  Upon closer inspection, a massive, shadowy figure seemed to writhe within the tempest, exuding an immensely powerful aura.</p><p>It resembled a fire god dancing in the heavens!</p><p>“Zu Sheng Fire…”</p><p>Seeing the fiery apparition, a profound reverence washed over Shi Ying’s face.  It was a force of terrifying magnitude, far beyond anything she could ever hope to achieve.</p><p>Below the storm, most of Shen Gang Peak was shrouded in a green mist, like a jade cloak draped over the mountain.  Lightning danced wildly, striking the mist, causing only minor ripples.</p><p>Shifting her gaze, Shi Ying turned to a dangerous-looking peak next to Shen Gang Peak, activating her flying artifact to approach.</p><p>The peaks surrounding Shen Gang Peak were ranked according to the quality of their spirit veins. Those to the east of Shen Gang Peak possessed the finest veins, and the sect's forbidden grounds were located there.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment elders naturally occupied the best cave dwellings.</p><p>Shi Ying, a veteran among Qi Condensation disciples, had a cave dwelling on a peak close to Shen Gang Peak, blessed with rich spiritual energy.</p><p>This mountain, facing Shen Gang Peak, appeared as if sliced cleanly from base to summit, forming a sheer cliff.  A narrow, man-made stone path, with rudimentary stone railings, wound along the cliff face, connecting the various cave dwellings.</p>
