      The upcoming Catastrophe instilled horror in people’s hearts,
                but the people on the street currently had broad smiles on their
                faces, as if the Supers had driven off their fear.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Under regulation, I need escort you into the city, ” Lerden
                said.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “It seems like your civilization really worships the Supers,”
                Han Xiao commented.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “It’s more like gratitude rather than worship,” Lerden replied
                calmly. “After our race faced sudden changed and migrated to
                this planet, we still don’t have enough power to stand on our
                own. The efficiency of resource gathering is too slow for us to
                sustain our consumption, and we needed to purchase a lot of
                materials from the galaxy. Therefore, our expenses are greater
                than our production.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “In order for us to survive, Supers that are strong enough will
                head into the universe and become mercenaries. Most of their
                rewards are sent home, and it is the main source of economic
                income. There was no way for this civilization to build enough
                weapons to fight the Catastrophe.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had a better understanding of the situation. The Sunil
                was a civilization in crisis. They could only temporarily rely
                on strong individuals, such as the Supers, to support the entire
                economy of the race. That was why the people treated the Supers
                like heroes, and one held great honor if one was a super.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao still remembered that Lerden was extremely cheap. In
                reality, Lerden gave all his income to the race, so he tried to
                spend as little as possible, all to contribute more to the race.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “It will bring disastrous effects if this civilization keeps on
                relying on the Supers.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Lerden nodded. “That is indeed true, but we do not have any
                other choice. In the end, it is all because of the Catastrophe,
                which is slowing down our recovery. We have to split significant
                portions of our funds to build weapons and military equipment to
                defend against the Catastrophe. Our development in
                infrastructure and industries has been held back because of all
                the extra expenses that won’t help the economy.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “If we don’t solve problem of the Catastrophe, we cannot break
                away from this vicious cycle, and our civilization would always
                suffer till the end of time.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “We tried a lot of ways to solve the problems, and we even
                considered killing all the beasts, but that is worst option. Not
                only is it impossible to deal with, once the food chain is
                destroyed, the entire planet will face an inevitable death.
                Thus, we chose another way—trying to excavate the Prophecy
                Stones and deal with the cause of Catastrophe once and for all.
                The project has been going on for years, and we are cleansing
                the stones bit by bit. One day, the Psychic Current will
                disappear, and the race will never have to face the tragedy of
                the Catastrophe again…”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Lerden’s face let out a sense of hope. “There’s always light at
                the end of the tunnel.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had a decent impression of the Sunils. They were a
                resilient race with the Supers carrying more and more
                responsibility in order for the civilization to live on. They
                had no complaints.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       What a pity…
      </em>
      Han Xiao sighed as he
                remembered the fate of the Sunils in the previous world.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Supers spread out after they reached the city and went back
                to their home. The crowd also slowly scattered.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao used his distorted memories and finally reached an
                alleyway after circling around. He stopped in front of a black
                narrow door, and a wine glass was hung on the sign.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “A bar? The person you want to visit is here?” Lerden frowned.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Do you have problem with that?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “… No.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Lerden remained expressionless. He looked down on people who
                spent their money for leisure as he thought that it was being
                wasteful of their money and their life.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After all, he had lost his right to enjoy his life.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      They pushed open the door and walked into the bar. The bar was
                dim, and there were not any customers. The city was in an
                emergency state, so no one had to guts to get drunk in a bar.
                Han Xiao walked in front of the counter, and a soft snore came
                from the back of the counter.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Great Mechanic Han looked over and saw a man sleeping with
                his head on the counter. He was well asleep alongside a pile of
                empty bottles.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Bang!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao smacked the counter as hard as he could and shouted,
                “Customer is here! Wake up!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The man’s fingers moved at first, and he let out a long breath
                from his nose. He then finally stood up with the stench of
                alcohol oozing from his body. His eyes were lifeless, and he
                looked like he was only half awake. The man then asked, “What do
                you want?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Two signatures.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “One is enough,” Lerden interjected.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The man yawned. “Pay first.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao took out his communicator and prepared to pay. The man
                suddenly laughed out loud and said, “My dear, you are not trying
                to pay with Enas, right? This is a small business, so we only
                accept local currencies.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Lerden frowned. He usually spent his time in the galaxy, so the
                Sunil currency was not worth much for him. He reached for his
                pocket and wanted to pay for Han Xiao, but at the same time, Han
                Xiao laughed. “I don’t have Sunil currency, can I use another
                method of payment?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The man did not look at Han Xiao and reached for another bottle.
                “Like what?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “A name.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The man frowned, looking annoyed. He glared at Han Xiao and
                replied, “I don’t have time for a game. Get out if you are not
                paying.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Delvis,” Han Xiao said in a calm voice, but it was as loud as
                thunder in the ears of the man.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The man froze as he tried to take a sip from the bottle. The
                relaxed atmosphere vanished, and he became expressionless, as if
                he was not drunk at all. The dizziness in his eyes disappeared
                instantly, and he stared right in Han Xiao’s eyes.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He quietly put down the bottle and said, “Wait for a moment, I
                need to wash my face.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The man walked away from the counter and went to the bathroom.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Only Han Xiao and Lerden were in the bar, and Lerden said, “You
                don’t even know him, so you are not visiting someone you’ve met
                before.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I know his brother, that’s why I decided to visit him,” Han
                Xiao explained.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The drunk man was Herlous, and Delvis was his older brother. The
                subclass that Han Xiao was interested in was called [Ordnance
                Engineer]. For players, this subclass was extremely rare, and
                there was a method among the Sunils to change his class. The
                item for activation was called [Delvis’ Journal].
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Delvis was a famous ordnance engineer before the Sunil race was
                attacked. He created a lot of inventions for military equipment,
                and he wrote all his thoughts in his journal. After DarkStar
                attacked, Delvis died in the battle, and the journal was handed
                to Herlous.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao wanted to borrow the journal from Herlous to change his
                class.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After a while, Herlous got back to the counter with his head
                washed. He was a middle-aged Sunil. His skin was light blue, and
                there were a few wrinkles on the side of his forehead, far fewer
                than one might expect of a hundred-and-fifty-year-old. Other
                than that, he was almost the same as a Super.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Herlous opened up a bottle and brought it to Han Xiao. “I don’t
                know how you found me, but my brother’s name is worth a bottle.
                I brew this myself.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The bottle was covered with white smoke, and the smell of
                alcohol penetrated their noses. Alcohol made by Sunils was
                usually made from the leaves of a certain tree, which had a
                bitter taste. After a sip, Han Xiao felt the spiciness on his
                tongue.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I am just a mechanic. I have heard your brother’s name, and I
                want to borrow his journal.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Is that it?” Herlous raised his eyebrows and tried to get more
                information.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “That’s it for now.” Han Xiao laughed and glanced at Lerden. “Do
                you think I have another purpose?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Herlous heard the obscure response and asked in a cold voice,
                “Do you think this is threatening?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “No, no. I am being friendly.” Han Xiao smiled. “But for a nice
                person like yourself, you won’t reject this small request,
                right?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      On the side, Lerden did not understand what was happening. Were
                they still speaking with a real language? Why could he not
                understand?
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Herlous hesitated for a while, but his expression showed that he
                had given up. He went into the house and came out after a while
                with the journal in his hand. He slammed it on the desk and
                said, “Leave when you are done.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao touched the journal, and the interface popped out a
                hint.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      _____________________
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      You obtained [Delvis’s Journal].
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      _____________________
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He had finally obtained it! Han Xiao suppressed his excitement
                as he opened the diary. He acted like he understood everything,
                but the journal was written in the Sunil language, which looked
                like cursive English. However, it did not matter if he don’t
                know the language. The interface showed a progress bar, and as
                long as he finished ‘reading’ the book, he could change his
                class.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Through the normal mission, one needed to be extraordinarily
                lucky to obtain the journal. The procedure to obtain the journal
                was complex, since no one knew the identity of Herlous. Most
                people would not think that a stranger working in a bar was that
                man. Most of the time, the players would only find out about the
                journal by becoming friends with Herlous and drinking with him.
                Only then would Herlous would start talking about his brother
                when he was drunk.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, Han Xiao knew the information, so he directly cut to
                the end without going through the complicated procedure.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Lerden was surprised and asked, “Can you read Sunil?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao closed the book and said, “I can’t”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Then why are you reading it‽” Herlous stared at Han Xiao with
                his eyes wide open.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Just think of it as me paying my respects to your brother.
                Thanks for the drink.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao put down the journal and smiled as he turned away.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “What a weird guy. Don’t disturb me again!” Herlous shouted from
                behind Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Maybe I will.” Han Xiao looked back playfully.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After walking out of the bar, Han Xiao opened up the interface
                and looked at the new hint. He was in a good mood. He had
                finally gotten the subclass, and the explosive amount of
                experience points could finally be used!
