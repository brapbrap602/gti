<h1>Chapter 748: The Sky Tower</h1><p>While Qin Sang and the others were battling cunning insects and monstrous beasts in the dense forest,</p><p>before the Sky Tower,</p><p>over a dozen figures stood silently in the plaza. Their auras were subdued, their attire strange, clearly different from humans; they were all Yuan Ying Grandmasters of the Witch Clan.</p><p>Leading them was an elderly woman with white hair.</p><p>She wore the robe of the Grand Witch Priestess, a symbol of the highest status in the Witch Clan.  Half of her face was covered by a thin, colorful mask, like a cicada’s wing.  Her chin and lips, visible beneath the mask, were surprisingly red and full.</p><p>She looked up at the Sky Tower, lost in thought. After a moment, she suddenly turned to the void and said coldly, “Demon Lord, you’ve arrived. Why hide your presence and not reveal yourself?”</p><p>At these words, the other Yuan Ying masters’ expressions changed, and a commotion arose.</p><p>“Hehe, the Grand Witch Priestess's perception is indeed sharp. I’ve done my best to conceal my aura, yet I still couldn't hide it from you.”</p><p>A burst of laughter echoed from the void.  Then, a strange light appeared, and with a ‘whoosh,’ a middle-aged man materialized before them.</p><p>This man was the leader of the demonic path, the Demon Lord, who held sway over the Canglang Sea!</p><p>After the dissipation of the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost God’s light, no demonic energy, killing intent, or malevolent aura could be sensed from him. His gaze was calm, his demeanor extraordinary; he looked like a great scholar.</p><p>But upon his appearance, the Witch Clan’s Yuan Ying masters all looked as if facing a mortal enemy.</p><p>The Demon Lord seemed unconcerned that the Grand Witch Priestess had exposed him, ignoring the wary gazes of the Witch Clan Yuan Ying masters. He looked directly into the Grand Witch Priestess’s eyes.</p><p>Only the old woman’s expression remained unchanged. She looked deeply at the Demon Lord and said calmly, “You showed yourself once before, so naturally I must be cautious. However, I’ve heard that the true treasure within the Seven Killing Hall can only be accessed when it chooses to appear. Is there another treasure left outside that is worth your personal visit?”</p><p>The Demon Lord chuckled, shrugging his shoulders. “Why do you ask what you already know? The Witch Clan has shown they’re willing to pay any price to force us humans to share the Seven Killing Hall, and then went to great lengths to break through the formations. How could we not be cautious? Unfortunately, that slippery old ghost from the Heavenly Dao Sect claimed his cultivation technique was flawed, that he suffered internal injuries and needs to close himself off for recuperation. That left me with no choice but to make this trip. I'm also curious what could possibly remain in the Seven Killing Hall, a place that's been practically razed to the ground, that would warrant all this effort.”</p><p>The old woman scoffed. “Whether Friend Lingzhuzi is truly injured or faking it, who can say for sure? Even if you've laid a net outside the Seven Killing Hall to ambush us, I wouldn't be surprised in the least.”</p><p>“Same here…”</p><p>The Demon Lord chuckled, “Friend Fang, didn’t you also stay hidden? I’m quite uneasy myself.”</p><p>The old woman coldly snorted, “So you’re determined to follow me?”</p><p>The Demon Lord smiled but didn’t answer.</p><p>“Since you insist on following, I won’t stop you. Let’s see what happens.”</p><p>The old woman withdrew her gaze, ignoring the Demon Lord, and addressed the others. “Fellow Daoists, your tasks have already been assigned; I won’t say any more. Success or failure depends on this action. Let’s move!”</p><p>At these words, the Witch Clan Yuan Ying masters dispersed, each heading in a different direction. The speed of Yuan Ying Grandmasters was truly remarkable. In an instant, they scattered like flowers falling from the sky, vanishing into the depths of the mountains.</p><p>The old woman entered the Sky Tower alone.</p><p>The Demon Lord hadn’t expected the Witch Clan to split up their forces so drastically.</p><p>“Is the old witch playing tricks, or is she really looking for something?”</p><p>After a moment’s hesitation, the Demon Lord’s palm glowed with strange light. He separated several strands of it, sending them flying into the deep mountains, then followed the old woman into the Sky Tower himself.</p><p>After the brief flurry of activity, the area outside the Sky Tower returned to its quiet state.</p><p>A while later, figures began to emerge from the surrounding hills. They had witnessed the confrontation between the Demon Lord and the Grand Witch Priestess, fortunate that neither paid them any attention.</p><p>Some hesitated and left, while others gritted their teeth and rushed in.</p><p>…</p><p>“Follow this river forward.”</p><p>In the jungle,</p><p>thanks to the Merchant Guild's thorough preparations, Qin Sang and the others were still unharmed.</p><p>Xiang Yi led them to a river.</p><p>This river was very strange; its wide surface was covered with purple algae, and the river water itself was purple. This large river flowed through the dense forest, its origin unknown.</p><p>The purple river water flowed gently, the purple algae obscuring the view, the water deep and murky, nothing visible beneath.</p><p>The river gave them an unpleasant feeling, and they all kept as far from the banks as possible. The memories of the insects and monsters in the forest were still fresh in their minds.</p><p>This river looks so strange, it’s definitely a dangerous place!</p><p>“This is the legendary Purple River!”</p><p>The cultivator with the Pan surname’s face suddenly turned very grim, and the mask on his face made him look even stranger.</p><p>“Following the Purple River upstream will lead you to the most dangerous part of this forest, a place shrouded in purple poisonous mist, known as the terrifying Purple Mist Death Zone, which has claimed countless cultivators’ lives. Fellow Daoist Xiang, you wouldn't be taking us to the Purple Mist Death Zone, would you?”</p><p>The cultivator with the Pan surname’s eyes widened as he questioned.</p><p>Hearing this, everyone else showed signs of alarm, stopping in their tracks and staring at Xiang Yi.</p><p>The Purple Mist Death Zone was one of the most dangerous places in the Seven Kills Hall, also known as one of the Three Poison Lands.  Elders warned those who followed not to go to these places.</p><p>No one expected the Merchant Guild to send them to such a place.</p><p>With their cultivation levels, whether they could withstand the poisonous mist’s erosion in the Purple Mist Death Zone was unknown, let alone the other ubiquitous dangers.</p><p>Going there was a suicide mission; it was impossible to complete the task.</p><p>Xiang Yi remained calm, nodding and saying, “Since we’re here, I’ll stop beating around the bush.  The Merchant Guild has given orders: we must enter the Purple Mist Death Zone.  To this end, the Guild Leader bestowed upon me a wondrous antidote treasure, personally refined by him.  As long as we don't go deep into the very core of the Purple Mist Death Zone, with this treasure, we can easily resist the poisonous mist, so fellow Daoists need not worry.”</p><p>The Liu couple frowned, “I seem to recall some predecessors who entered the Purple Mist Death Zone mentioning that the toxicity of the mist changes. However, Daoist Xiang, we want to make it clear beforehand: if, after entering the Purple Mist Death Zone, the treasure shows signs of being unable to withstand the poisonous mist, we must abandon the mission and retreat.  We don’t want to die there inexplicably.”</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><p>They already knew the Merchant Guild’s task wouldn't be easy, but they never imagined they would be sent to such a dangerous place.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred.  He wondered if the Fat Silkworm’s anti-venom armor could withstand the poisonous mist.</p><p>He had only tested it on demonic beasts in the Core Formation stage before.</p><p>After the Fat Silkworm’s transformation, the anti-venom armor could easily resist the intense poison of great demons.</p><p>But that was poison produced by demonic beasts, certainly different from the strange poison of the Purple Mist, born from the heavens and earth.</p><p>Xiang Yi dismissed their concerns, saying, “The Merchant Guild has gone to such great lengths and made so many preparations.  Could it be that they intend to murder us? Fellow Daoists, please rest assured, I have a plan, and if the situation becomes impossible, I won't force it.”</p>
