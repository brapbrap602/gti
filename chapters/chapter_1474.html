<h1>Chapter 1466: Glazed (6k, additional chapter for the alliance leader Tong Lingyu)</h1><p>---</p><p>**Snow Listening Pavilion, Main Peak.**</p><p>Glazed returned to her secluded cave to meditate and cultivate in peace.</p><p>Shi Xue, meanwhile, gathered her disciples to handle the accumulated trivial matters that had piled up during this period. She was so busy that she was overwhelmed until late at night. Finally, Shi Xue let out a long sigh, dismissed her attendants, and stepped out of the main hall.</p><p>The night was deep and heavy.</p><p>Shi Xue stood high above, admiring the night view of the Snow Listening Pavilion.</p><p>Some mountains were covered in pristine snow, while others were warm as spring, lush with vegetation. The scenery varied greatly, as spiritual arrays were used to isolate the external cold. The appearance of each mountain depended entirely on the mood of its master.</p><p>The mountain range was dotted with pavilions and halls.</p><p>Jade bridges arched between the peaks like rainbows.</p><p>On the main peak, no one was allowed to fly—not even Shi Xue, the Pavilion Master.</p><p>After gazing for a long time, she took a deep breath and descended the jade steps.</p><p>Both her and Glazed's caves were located on the main peak, not far from each other.</p><p>Shi Xue first arrived at Glazed's cave but hesitated for a moment. Deciding not to disturb her cultivation, she continued toward her own cave. As she passed by the entrance of a quiet hall, her expression shifted slightly. She paused, then pushed the door open and entered.</p><p>This hall was where the Snow Listening Pavilion enshrined the ancestral tablets. Two disciples were stationed there to tend to the eternal lamps. Upon seeing the Pavilion Master enter, they hurried forward to bow.</p><p>Shi Xue dismissed the two disciples, closed the hall doors, and lit three incense sticks. She bowed before the ancestral tablets behind the altar and inserted the incense into the burner.</p><p>The smoke curled upward.</p><p>Shi Xue's gaze pierced through the smoke, settling on one of the tablets. The name inscribed on it was Bing Yao—the master of both her and Glazed.</p><p>For the first time, a trace of vulnerability appeared on Shi Xue's face. She sat down, as if she were a child again, and began to speak softly to her master. "Master, I've made all the necessary preparations for my junior sister. Once she adjusts her state to its peak, she will be ready to break through. Not only will her Glacial Soul Divine Light reach perfection, but she will also shatter her bottleneck, advancing to the mid-Nascent Soul stage before the first Heavenly Tribulation descends. At that time, junior sister will qualify to enter the Body Cleansing Pool. With her talent and this opportunity, she will undoubtedly become a great cultivator in the future, revitalizing the Snow Listening Pavilion. But..."</p><p>At this point, the joy in Shi Xue's eyes faded, replaced by a hint of worry.</p><p>"Junior sister has a stubborn temperament. Back then, to stabilize her Dao Heart, she sealed her emotions with the Glacial Soul, cutting off all feelings of love. Yet, a karmic entanglement has emerged at this critical moment. That heartless man suddenly reappeared. Junior sister appears normal on the surface, but sealing emotions is not the same as erasing them. I fear her Dao Heart may be shaken, and... and..."</p><p>A sigh echoed through the hall.</p><p>"If it were an ordinary person, it might not matter. But I can see that this man is one of the most exceptional figures in the world. Can junior sister truly let go of him? I can't help her directly; all I can do is offer indirect advice, which is useless. That heartless man won't allow himself to be controlled by others."</p><p>Shi Xue's eyes revealed confusion. "Master, if your spirit is watching over us, could you tell me what junior sister's heart knot truly is? What should I do?"</p><p>The night was silent.</p><p>In the depths of winter, no sounds of birds or beasts could be heard.</p><p>Shi Xue sat cross-legged on a cushion, remaining silent for a long time.</p><p>The hall was dim, with only the flickering light of a candle illuminating her slender figure.</p><p>---</p><p>**The next evening.**</p><p>Qin Sang was deep in meditation when he sensed the array outside his small building being disturbed. His divine sense swept out, revealing Shi Xue.</p><p>"Greetings, Pavilion Master Shi."</p><p>Qin Sang stepped out of the building and clasped his hands in greeting.</p><p>Shi Xue returned the gesture, glanced at the building, and smiled. "Are you satisfied with this place, Daoist?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "The scenery is exquisite. It's a rare and exceptional cave."</p><p>"As long as you don't feel slighted," Shi Xue said, standing in front of the building without entering. She then spoke seriously, "There's one more matter that requires your cooperation. I didn't mention it yesterday due to the fatigue of the journey. According to the rules of the Snow Listening Pavilion, when appointing a guest elder, one must pay respects to the ancestors and have them bear witness. Although you are only assuming the identity of a guest elder, it would be inappropriate to break this rule."</p><p>"Is that so? What do I need to do, Pavilion Master? Please instruct me."</p><p>Since he was here, Qin Sang naturally intended to cooperate fully.</p><p>"You don't need to do much. Just offer a stick of incense before the ancestral tablets."</p><p>Shi Xue led Qin Sang toward the hall where the ancestors were enshrined, explaining as they walked, "As long as I and Hall Master Jiang recognize you, no one else's approval is needed. Hall Master Jiang will handle the matter with the Grand Elder. I heard that you plan to travel soon, so I wanted to complete the ceremony quietly before you leave and give you the elder's token. If you encounter any trouble outside, you can use this token to mobilize the forces of the Profound Heaven Palace. When the time is right, we will publicly announce your identity."</p><p>Hall Master Jiang was the mid-Nascent Soul cultivator of the Snow Listening Pavilion.</p><p>As they spoke, the two of them moved from the back mountain to the main peak. Perhaps Shi Xue had deliberately chosen this route, as they encountered no one along the way.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>The peaks surrounding the main peak were the most spiritually rich areas.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that many of the pavilions had glowing restrictions, indicating they were occupied. These were likely the pillars of the Snow Listening Pavilion.</p><p>At this point, Shi Xue, who was leading the way, slowed her pace and casually asked, "Do you have a Dao companion, Daoist? Even if they are not at the Nascent Soul stage, they can enjoy the same benefits as a guest elder."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Shi Xue and replied, "I am alone. I have no Dao companion."</p><p>Shi Xue looked surprised. "With your cultivation, finding a Dao companion shouldn't be difficult, right?"</p><p>"Aren't you also alone, Pavilion Master?"</p><p>Qin Sang countered, sensing something unusual in Shi Xue's behavior.</p><p>If Shi Xue was probing on behalf of Glazed, Qin Sang didn't believe it for a moment. Although he hadn't interacted much with Glazed, he understood her temperament well.</p><p>In both their eyes, what happened back then was merely a transaction.</p><p>If not for their unexpected reunion, they would have had no further connection.</p><p>"If I'm still stuck at this bottleneck a hundred years from now, I will seek a Dao companion and try dual cultivation," Shi Xue said frankly, without a hint of embarrassment. She even discussed it openly with Qin Sang. "You don't have any prejudice against dual cultivation, do you?"</p><p>"The harmony of Yin and Yang, the endless cycle of creation—it is a legitimate path. How could I reject it? However, dual cultivation between a man and a woman, where their lives and origins are intertwined, is the true Great Dao. But firstly, most dual cultivation techniques are biased, bordering on heretical paths. Secondly, finding a compatible Dao companion is as difficult as reaching the heavens. The difficulty of dual cultivation is no less than that of other Great Daos."</p><p>Having cultivated to this point, Qin Sang had even experimented with Corpse Pills. It was impossible for him not to have studied dual cultivation.</p><p>In the eyes of many cultivators, dual cultivation was a shortcut, equivalent to absorption techniques, often involving seductive arts. Even many so-called orthodox dual cultivation techniques could not escape this framework.</p><p>Temporary benefits, but endless future troubles.</p><p>Truly Great Dao-compatible dual cultivation techniques were exceedingly rare, and the requirements for the cultivators' talents were equally high, extending to both individuals.</p><p>"Your words are reasonable. This is also why I've been hesitant," Shi Xue said, glancing at Qin Sang thoughtfully and nodding in agreement.</p><p>As they spoke, the hall came into view.</p><p>The two of them pushed the door open and entered.</p><p>Glazed was inside, kneeling with her hands clasped in prayer. When she saw them enter, she stood up to greet them.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the room, landing on Bing Yao's tablet.</p><p>He already knew that Bing Yao was Glazed's master.</p><p>This person was clearly trapped in the Purple Micro Palace, her fate unknown, yet the Snow Listening Pavilion had already erected a tablet for her. Shi Xue and Glazed were as close as sisters, yet even Shi Xue was kept in the dark.</p><p>Some time ago, Glazed had secretly approached Qin Sang, asking him not to reveal this matter.</p><p>This made Qin Sang even more curious about Glazed's intentions. Was there some hidden reason behind Bing Yao's disappearance, or did Bing Yao have a powerful enemy?</p><p>Qin Sang was only concerned with the Holy Land and didn't plan to delve deeper, lest he stir up unnecessary trouble.</p><p>Shi Xue lit three incense sticks.</p><p>Qin Sang raised the incense, bowed three times, and inserted it into the burner, thus receiving the ancestors' acknowledgment. He then accepted the elder's token handed to him by Shi Xue.</p><p>The token contained a unique mark. When activated, it could summon nearby Profound Heaven Palace disciples to assist him.</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his thanks, stored the token, and exchanged a few more words with the two women before returning to his small building.</p><p>---</p><p>**Eastern Region of the Hidden Sun Realm.**</p><p>In this place stood a city rarely seen in the mortal world.</p><p>Even during the cold season, the city was bustling with activity, extremely prosperous.</p><p>From time to time, streaks of light flew over the city. The mortals were used to it, merely glancing up with envy before returning to their busy lives.</p><p>This city was a mix of mortals and cultivators.</p><p>At the center of the city was an inner city, off-limits not only to mortals but also to the rogue cultivators attached to the city without permission.</p><p>This was the territory of the Luo Family.</p><p>The Luo Family, a cultivator family under the Profound Heaven Palace, though not as powerful as the four main branches, was still quite famous in the Hidden Sun Realm. This was because the Luo Family cultivators excelled in dual cultivation, and the current family head was a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Patriarch was lofty and elusive.</p><p>At this moment, Luo Wan, the head of the Luo Family, was personally receiving an esteemed guest.</p><p>"I wondered why the magpies were chirping outside my window. So it was Pavilion Master Shi gracing us with your presence. What brings you to my humble abode with such good spirits?"</p><p>Luo Wan wore a qipao-like brocade dress, her posture graceful, exuding a hint of charm with every movement.</p><p>Even women, if their willpower was lacking, would blush upon seeing her.</p><p>Sitting across from her was none other than Shi Xue.</p><p>Shi Xue had left the Snow Listening Pavilion at some point to visit Luo Wan.</p><p>She and Luo Wan were clearly very familiar. Shi Xue glared playfully and retorted, "What blind magpie would dare approach your spider's den? Aren't they afraid of having their essence sucked dry and being devoured whole?"</p><p>"Knowing I'm a spider, you still dare to enter?"</p><p>Luo Wan wasn't offended. Her eyes were like silk, her breath like orchids.</p><p>She leaned slightly, her charm instantly magnified.</p><p>Shi Xue, though lively in temperament, was no match for the woman before her. She snorted, "Stop flirting in front of me. I'm here on serious business. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to your spider's den even if you begged me."</p><p>After a pause, Shi Xue asked somewhat awkwardly, "Does your Luo Family still have the *Goddess Heart Canon*?"</p><p>Luo Wan was taken aback. She straightened up and scrutinized Shi Xue, chuckling, "Old hag, have you finally developed worldly desires? Are you planning to feast on tender grass? Which young genius is so unfortunate?"</p><p>"Enough nonsense!"</p><p>Shi Xue looked impatient. "I'm here to request this dual cultivation technique on behalf of someone else. I can swear that it will only be passed on to the two of them and never leaked. If you agree, I will grant your Luo Family a spot in the Ice Wind Cave during the next Holy Land opening."</p><p>"The qualification for a Golden Core late-stage disciple to enter the Ice Wind Cave? Are you serious?"</p><p>All traces of Luo Wan's charm vanished, as if she had become a different person.</p><p>Her current demeanor was befitting of a Nascent Soul Patriarch.</p><p>Shi Xue snorted, "Do you think I would lie? I can swear by my heart demon, but you must not leak this matter. The Luo Family is attached to the Heavenly Mountain branch, but the origins of the Heavenly Mountain branch lie in the alliance of sects, forces, and rogue cultivators from the Heavenly Mountain region. Though it appears powerful now, it is internally divided, with numerous factions and conflicts. It's like a pot of boiling oil—impossible to allocate a spot to your Luo Family."</p><p>"You don't need to explain this to me."</p><p>Luo Wan tapped the table with her finger. "The Luo Family hasn't had anyone master the *Goddess Heart Canon* in two thousand years. It's like a chicken rib—useless. Trading it for a spot in the Ice Wind Cave isn't a bad deal. However, I must remind you of a few things to avoid any mishaps and you going back on your word.</p><p>"First, since the Luo Family obtained the *Goddess Heart Canon*, only two people have mastered it. Its difficulty is evident.</p><p>"This technique not only requires exceptional talent from the cultivator but also demands that the cultivator's emotions undergo intense fluctuations. These emotions cannot be feigned; they must stem from genuine feelings. The cultivator must be deeply infatuated, and only when their emotions reach their peak can they begin cultivating this technique.</p><p>"Second, if there is the slightest mistake, forcing the cultivation will result in a shattered Dao Heart, affecting both partners and binding them together in life and death.</p><p>"Over the countless years, many Luo Family geniuses have been ruined this way, gradually avoiding it like the plague and leaving it to gather dust.</p><p>"If you're seeking the *Goddess Heart Canon* for a close junior, I advise you to think carefully. If it ruins a promising talent, don't blame the Luo Family."</p><p>Hearing this, Shi Xue hesitated.</p><p>She had heard Luo Wan speak of the *Goddess Heart Canon* before and felt that Glazed's current state of mind was a perfect match for this technique. That was why she had come to the Luo Family to request it. She hadn't expected the consequences to be so severe.</p><p>Both Glazed and that heartless man were among the most exceptional figures in the world. Talent wasn't a concern.</p><p>Glazed's infatuation was also beyond doubt.</p><p>This was the rarest aspect.</p><p>Cultivators who reached the Nascent Soul stage had seen the world's splendor and weathered countless storms. Their emotions were rarely stirred, let alone driven to madness by love.</p><p>Thus, the *Goddess Heart Canon* was generally only suitable for young men and women who were inexperienced in the world, and their cultivation levels were inevitably low.</p><p>Unlike them, Glazed and that heartless man were both Nascent Soul cultivators. If they sensed something amiss, they could forcibly halt the dual cultivation, avoiding the tragic outcomes that befell the Luo Family disciples.</p><p>Thinking this, Shi Xue made up her mind. She extended her hand and said, "Thank you for the reminder! Whether it's suitable or not, we'll only know by trying."</p><p>She wasn't trying to force her junior sister and Qin Sang together. She knew she had no right to decide for them. This was merely a precaution.</p><p>Since Qin Sang's appearance, Shi Xue had been worried that Glazed, upon reuniting with her old flame, might become unstable in her Dao Heart.</p><p>This was a critical moment in Glazed's cultivation, and this issue couldn't be ignored.</p><p>At the moment of breaking through her bottleneck, Glazed wouldn't be able to divide her attention. The Glacial Soul's seal on her emotions wasn't absolute. If the seal failed, causing her emotions to fluctuate wildly, it could lead to a failed breakthrough, wasting all her efforts.</p><p>In severe cases, it could even cause Glazed's Dao Heart to collapse, cutting off her path to the Great Dao.</p><p>Shi Xue was deeply concerned but couldn't bring it up directly with Glazed. She could only offer indirect hints, letting Glazed come to the realization herself. Otherwise, it would backfire.</p><p>After much thought, the only thing she could do was obtain the *Goddess Heart Canon*.</p><p>If the Glacial Soul's seal failed and Glazed's long-suppressed emotions erupted, it would be the perfect moment to begin cultivating this technique.</p><p>At that time, Shi Xue would present the *Goddess Heart Canon* and let the two of them decide whether to cultivate it.</p><p>To this end, Shi Xue had subtly probed Qin Sang's stance, learning that he had no Dao companion and held no prejudice against dual cultivation. He simply hadn't found a suitable technique or partner.</p><p>In all the world, how many women could match her junior sister in beauty, talent, and aptitude?</p><p>Countless people in the Profound Heaven Palace admired her.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang and her junior sister had a history, making it a natural fit.</p><p>Shi Xue couldn't think of a reason for Qin Sang to refuse.</p><p>Luo Wan's earlier warnings were out of fear that the technique might cause problems, ruining a Nascent Soul cultivator's blood relative and bringing the Luo Family's wrath. Since Shi Xue was determined, Luo Wan was more than happy to oblige. She immediately took out a jade slip and handed it to Shi Xue.</p><p>"The requirements for entering the Dao are so extreme. This is a dual cultivation technique, not some absorption-based heretical path, right?"</p><p>Shi Xue couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"Of course," Luo Wan chuckled, her voice suddenly turning sultry. "This technique isn't limited to male-female pairs. Female-female pairs can also cultivate it, though one woman must practice the Yang Extreme Secret Art to absorb Yang energy. If you don't believe me, we can try it first?"</p><p>Shi Xue looked disgusted, spat, and stood up to leave.</p><p>Luo Wan, however, wasn't about to let her go. She blocked her path and made Shi Xue sign an agreement before finally letting her leave.</p><p>---</p><p>Shi Xue left the Luo Family and hurried back.</p><p>As soon as she returned to the Snow Listening Pavilion, she saw a message talisman left by Glazed at her cave. She immediately</p>
