<h1>Chapter 857: The Employer</h1><p>Xiang'an Auction House.</p><p>Qin Sang met Yi Danshi.</p><p>Yi Danshi looked exhausted.  Upon inquiry, Qin Sang learned that since the Great Desolate Island incident, the three major merchant alliances had stepped up their war preparations. Yi Danshi had been assigned to nonstop alchemy duties, leaving him utterly worn out.</p><p>"Yi is bound by circumstances," Yi Danshi said, taking a large gulp of something and leaning back in his chair. "It's Qin Daoyou who had foresight, free from constraint, and still able to live at ease."</p><p>Qin Sang saw through Yi Danshi's forced words. "While Qin enjoys freedom, I lack the protection of a large power.  If bullied, I have nowhere to appeal and can only swallow the bitter fruit.  Your hard work, Daoist Yi, is only temporary. Once the demonic sea unrest subsides, you will regain your freedom."</p><p>"Easier said than done."</p><p>Yi Danshi shook his head, his tone pessimistic.  "The scale of this demonic disturbance is unprecedented. Both sides are locked in a standoff; no one knows when the beast tide will be repelled."</p><p>After a shared lament about the current situation, Qin Sang brought up his business, only to receive more bad news.</p><p>"I've asked many old friends, all steeped in alchemy for years, but none have news of the three spirit herbs: Ba Xue Guo. Qin Daoyou, your search for these herbs will likely depend on luck..."</p><p>Yi Danshi expressed his sympathy.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Yi Danshi was right; obtaining the Ba Xue Guo and Mao Shan Teng was pure coincidence. For the final herb, Scorpion Venom Grass, all he could do was cast a wide net.</p><p>He produced a jade box.</p><p>Inside were a dozen or so Wind and Rain Orchids, a favorite of the Sky Eye Butterfly, greatly beneficial to its growth.</p><p>"I wouldn't dare trouble Daoist Yi, but I hope you can arrange an alchemist to help refine these into spirit pills."</p><p>Qin Sang handed both the formula and the orchids to Yi Danshi.</p><p>Yi Danshi glanced at the formula, becoming immediately interested. "Hmm? This formula and method… I've never seen it before.  In my opinion, the resulting medicine isn't for cultivators.  Please wait, Qin Daoyou. I'll go refine it myself; I'll be right back."</p><p>Yi Danshi's immediate understanding of the formula's purpose surprised Qin Sang.  Naturally, he was delighted that Yi Danshi would do it himself. While waiting, he scoured the auction house for useful cultivation resources.</p><p>...</p><p>Bao Gu Cave Mansion.</p><p>Qin Sang took a pill from a jade bottle.</p><p>The air filled with a floral fragrance.</p><p>These were the pills Yi Danshi refined using the Wind and Rain Orchids.</p><p>Catching the scent, the Sky Eye Butterfly perched on Qin Sang's right shoulder immediately fluttered its wings, crawling onto his finger, clearly impatient.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense its pleading and affection through its consciousness.</p><p>"Here you go."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, feeding the spirit pill to the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The butterfly swallowed it in one gulp, overjoyed, its large wings fluttering as it circled Qin Sang.  Its size had increased several times; a single wing was now the size of an adult's palm, but its growth had slowed considerably, despite Qin Sang feeding it the best pills and orchids.</p><p>The self-transformation of spiritual insects was incredibly difficult. The Sky Eye Butterfly's natural growth rate was extremely slow. Without blood feeding and the scriptures from the Yu Ling Sect, Qin Sang would likely not live to see it reach its third transformation peak.</p><p>"Choosing the Sky Eye Butterfly as my primary spirit insect was the right decision.  Hopefully, it will be helpful when I form my Nascent Soul."</p><p>Compared to the Sky Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang found the Fat Silkworm's condition perplexing.</p><p>After eating a piece of purple crystal, the silkworm had fallen into a deep sleep.  Upon waking, it demanded more purple crystal, ate some, and then slept again.</p><p>Qin Sang had become its keeper.</p><p>It was impossible to wake it during its sleep, fortunately, he hadn’t encountered any poisonous beasts or land during this time.  However, after consuming the purple crystals, the Fat Silkworm seemed largely unchanged, its growth rate no faster than the Sky Eye Butterfly's.</p><p>"Is it accumulating strength, or is something else going on?"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't guess.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm remained an enigma, its origins unknown. It voluntarily submitted to him, its fragile body capable of consuming potent poisons as delicacies.</p><p>After feeding the Sky Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang followed his routine: blood feeding his external avatar, then cultivating the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Chapter*, and finally, undergoing starlight body refinement at night.</p><p>His life was monotonous and orderly, preparing for his next trip to the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>He had planned to visit Lan Dou Gate soon, but the need for high-grade spirit stones had forced him to postpone it, awaiting news in his cave.</p><p>After more than a month of secluded cultivation, there was still no news from the shopkeeper.  Just as Qin Sang was about to take the initiative to ask, the cave's protective formations were triggered.</p><p>Qin Sang found a message slip.  After reading it, a pleased expression crossed her face.  She immediately sealed her cave dwelling, leaving a body double to continue its cultivation, and then hurried away.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, you arrived quickly," the shopkeeper remarked, teasingly, as Qin Sang entered the shop.</p><p>"I was compelled by circumstances, what else could I do?" Qin Sang replied repeatedly.</p><p>"Daoist, please come with me."</p><p>The shopkeeper closed up shop and led the way.  Qin Sang followed, noticing that he was heading towards the gate of Tianxing City, and asked, "What is the employer's identity? Are they not in Tianxing City?"</p><p>"I am only a middleman," the shopkeeper replied, "and I know little about the employer's background or identity. Like you, Daoist Qin, I only deal with business. They requested a meeting outside Tianxing Island, so I'll take you there. You can discuss matters directly. Of course, if you'd prefer not to, I can send a message to decline."</p><p>"So you don't know what the employer is gathering people for?"</p><p>"Correct," the shopkeeper nodded.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. After a moment's thought, realizing her body double could cultivate in the cave, and carrying everything else she needed, she said, "Please lead the way."</p><p>The shopkeeper's tone softened. "Daoist Qin needn't worry. From what I gather, the employer may be hindered by something, and likely urgently needs people.  I contacted them, and they immediately asked me to bring you to the meeting…"</p><p>As they spoke, they left Tianxing City, soared into the air, and flew towards the island.</p><p>The shopkeeper flew north for half a day before arriving at an island inhabited by ordinary people.  Pointing ahead, he said, "The meeting place is on this island."</p><p>Seeing it was not a desolate place, Qin Sang's expression relaxed.  She and the shopkeeper landed on the island and flew towards a towering mountain.</p><p>As they approached the mountain, Qin Sang sensed several auras at the summit. The others had also noticed them.</p><p>At the mountaintop, there were stone tables and benches, with a clear stream gently flowing. A young man sat there, calmly drinking tea.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, Qin Sang suddenly felt a sense of alarm. She stopped their flight and heard a whistling sound from the mountaintop, followed by a young man in white clothes descending swiftly.</p><p>The shopkeeper also stopped, and once the young man approached, introduced them. "Daoist Fang, this is Daoist Qin, whom I mentioned. Daoist Qin, Daoist Fang is the employer. I've brought you together as requested, and I shall take my leave now."</p>
