<h1>Chapter 2098: Sixfold Transformation</h1><p>Sacred沐yuan.</p><p>Sacred Lake.</p><p>Min Shu and the elders activated the grand formation.  The Sacred Lake was surrounded by azure waterfalls, the water curtains isolating the inside from the outside, yet the water here flowed upwards towards the sky. The clan leader's and elders' relatives, along with the most esteemed members of the Changyou clan, had taken refuge within the Sacred Lake.</p><p>The Sacred Lake could not hold many people; as for those outside, they were left to fend for themselves.</p><p>Outside the waterfall, a figure appeared stealthily, its form blurry—it was Qin Sang's spirit body. Qin Sang's spirit body had arrived to probe the reality of the sacred site, and he witnessed this scene.</p><p>A colorful light flickered on his shoulder, shaped like a butterfly's wings—it was the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The man and the butterfly observed the waterfall. The Sky Eye Butterfly spread its wings, the Sky Eye patterns on its wings flashing with vibrant, then deepening, light.</p><p>They attempted to see through the water curtain, to spy on the inside of the Sacred Lake and the structure of its grand formation.</p><p>Under the Sky Eye power, the scene within gradually became clear. Their gaze pierced the water curtain, revealing numerous palaces and pavilions built on the shores of the Sacred Lake, housing many Changyou clan members.</p><p>Because of their long-standing respect and fear of the Sacred Lake, no one dared to step foot within it, remaining only on the shore for fear of desecrating their ancestors.</p><p>Shifting his gaze, Qin Sang noticed the stone statues on the shore of the Sacred Lake. He stared at them for a while, then turned his attention to the Changyou clan's ancestral temple in the center of the Sacred Lake.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't find the Changyou clan's top experts on the shore; they were likely all in the ancestral temple, where the heart of the Sacred Lake formation must be.</p><p>It would be impossible to attack the ancestral temple without breaking the formation. His gaze returned to the stone statues on the shore.</p><p>These statues depicted various Changyou clan members, possibly past strong individuals or heroes, but they were certainly not merely for worship.  The energy emanating from these statues was unusual, connected to the grand formation. Even if they weren't the core of the formation, they were a crucial part, and he might be able to start here.</p><p>Qin Sang was patient, carefully unraveling the structure of the Sacred Lake formation.  He also had another advantage.</p><p>After the Sky Eye Butterfly underwent its sixth transformation, it didn't develop powers like the Sky Eye Radiance or the Separating Radiance it had previously possessed. Initially, Qin Sang thought it was related to the butterfly's past mutations.</p><p>After its sixth transformation, the Sky Eye Butterfly's ability to absorb tribulation thunder had significantly strengthened. It might have embarked on a path entirely different from that of a normal Sky Eye Butterfly, hence its inability to develop normal Sky Eye Butterfly powers.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't too disappointed.  Cultivator realm was paramount; a rise in realm brought changes to one's life level. As long as the Sky Eye Butterfly continued to improve, any lack of powers was acceptable to him.</p><p>Gradually, however, Qin Sang realized this wasn't the case. The Sky Eye Butterfly hadn't failed to develop powers; rather, its new powers weren't outwardly apparent.</p><p>After some experiments with the Sky Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang discovered its ability to break through formations, seals, and barriers had become far stronger, and not just in a simple increase in ability.</p><p>Previously, breaking through formations relied on the Sky Eye power to uncover secrets, find flaws hidden by the formation's creator, and then deduce a method to break through based on the formation's structure.</p><p>Now, for certain formations, the Sky Eye Butterfly could directly pass through, as if it could merge with nothingness, traverse the void, and directly appear inside without needing to break through—the barriers of this world were no longer barriers.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the scene of the Sky Eye Butterfly undergoing its sixth transformation tribulation; its form appeared and disappeared, like it was constantly traversing between reality and nothingness.</p><p>The Ghost Mother had said that the seventh transformation Sky Eye Butterfly was called the Void Butterfly, leading Qin Sang to suspect a connection between its abilities and its name.</p><p>Could the sixth transformation Sky Eye Butterfly already possess the ability to traverse the void? Or, due to its mutation, had it prematurely mastered this power?</p><p>However, in subsequent experiments, Qin Sang found that this ability was only effective against simple formations and seals, not against intricate and complex formations.  He suspected it was due to its insufficient cultivation. Moreover, the Sky Eye Butterfly couldn’t yet control its power; sometimes it succeeded, sometimes it failed, making it very unstable.</p><p>It was still uncertain whether the Sky Eye Butterfly transformed itself into nothingness or traversed between nothingness and reality. Once it reached the mid-stage of its sixth transformation, its powers would surely improve. He would have to verify this then.</p><p>Nevertheless, with the Sky Eye Butterfly’s help, Qin Sang found breaking through formations and seals much easier than before.</p><p>As he examined the statues one by one, Qin Sang gradually discerned some clues, and then fell into thought.</p><p>These statues appeared in his mind, forming a formation of statues. Then, one after another, they leaped from their pedestals, exchanging positions and changing formations.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang discerned several key threads, which he used as clues to continue his deductions, achieving significant progress.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that the Changyou tribe's Sacred Lake Formation was indeed quite mysterious, but its power was limited.  Given more time, he was confident he could devise a way to break it.</p><p>However, simply breaking the formation wasn't enough.  He needed a swift victory, securing control of the ancestral temple before they could summon aid from the Zhuyan tribe.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his calculations, believing it wasn't impossible.</p><p>Yet, for some reason, whenever Qin Sang considered attacking the Sacred Lake Formation, he felt a nagging sense of unease.  At his level of cultivation, hallucinations were out of the question. There had to be something he was overlooking.  Frowning, Qin Sang scrutinized the Sacred Lake again, his gaze finally settling on the Changyou ancestral temple.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed; he had finally found the anomaly.</p><p>The temple's energy was connected to the Sacred Lake Formation, emitting a pure, sky-blue radiance. But at intervals, a fleeting, deep-blue shadow flickered within the heart of the blue light.</p><p>The deep-blue shadow appeared only briefly and was extremely subtle, easily overlooked.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what the deep-blue shadow was, but when he focused on it, he instinctively felt a warning.  It might be a remnant of some powerful Changyou ancestor, or perhaps a hidden mechanism left behind during the temple's ancient construction.</p><p>Regardless, the deep-blue shadow was extremely dangerous. Qin Sang recalled what Silu had said – that the ancestral temples of each Yi Ren tribe were exceptionally complex.  Even if he could forcibly break the Sacred Lake Formation, it would be pointless if he couldn't control the ancestral temple and prevent them from sending out warnings.</p><p>The path to breaking the formation seemed blocked...</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't discouraged. He remained calm and continued to think.  Then, another overlooked problem struck him.</p><p>Had the Changyou tribe kept both the formation and the temple active continuously?</p><p>The Sacred Lake Formation's purpose was to protect the sacred grounds; its constant activation was understandable.  But the ancestral temple symbolized their ancestors. Even the Changyou chief couldn't remain there constantly without risking accusations of disrespect.</p><p>Why had those Changyou experts preemptively activated the temple, as if foreseeing an attack?  Who else besides him could threaten the Changyou sacred grounds?</p><p>If they were guarding against the Stormwind Realm, it meant the Changyou tribe already knew about the existence of a Transcendent cultivator there!</p><p>Qin Sang's focus had been on breaking the formation. Discovering the deep-blue shadow made him realize this problem. If this was the truth, was the Changyou chief's massacre in the Canglang Sea a deliberate attempt to lure him out?</p><p>This couldn't possibly be the Changyou chief's own scheme. What was their true objective?</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang's Dharma body immediately contacted his main body and decisively departed from the Sacred Lake, flying eastward.</p><p>...</p><p>Canglang Sea.</p><p>Hidden in the shadows, Qin Sang's main body, combining his Dharma body's findings with Silu's observations, concluded that a conspiracy likely lurked behind the Changyou chief's actions.</p><p>The question was, how had they been exposed?</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that news of his clash with Yuan Miao had leaked.  A powerful Yaozu expert appearing in Yi Ren territory was certainly conspicuous and might have attracted attention. The Changyou tribe might have obtained the information through some channel, or perhaps someone had warned them.</p><p>Within the entire Zhuyan tribe and its affiliated tribes' territory, only the Stormwind Realm's Yaozu were a significant force.  It made sense that the Changyou chief would suspect something based on this.</p><p>Knowing Qin Sang's strength in defeating Yuan Miao, and with allies beside him, the Changyou chief still dared to approach, implying that he had help.</p><p>Perhaps the Changyou chief, realizing he couldn't swallow the Stormwind Realm alone, had changed tactics and proactively sought external aid. Another reason could be his advancement to Void Realm level 2, granting him the strength to collaborate with other powerful tribes without fear of being dominated.</p><p>The Changyou chief's actions had exposed the existence of the Stormwind Realm to other tribes, making the situation considerably more complex.</p><p>With the situation unclear, Qin Sang couldn't devise a good counterstrategy. He could only force the Changyou chief's backers to reveal themselves and then react accordingly.</p><p>Only Qin Sang's Dharma image and Silu's companion beast were present.  If the Changyou chief's allies proved too strong, they could still escape.</p><p>...</p><p>On the battlefield, Zai Zhen emerged from the shadows. He lamented Min Zhuo's weakness – revealing his defeat before even uncovering the enemy's full strength. He also lamented Qin Sang's decisiveness; attacking without hesitation, rendering their prepared arguments useless.</p><p>When Min Zhuo's backers appeared, Qin Sang and Silu showed no surprise, nor did they hesitate.</p><p>The crimson-feathered bird plunged into the jade bowl. The bowl, half-full of water, became the bird's bath, leaving Min Zhuo speechless.</p><p>Each crimson feather transformed into blazing fire, erupting from the jade bowl. The flames spread rapidly along the torrent, instantly overpowering its momentum.</p><p>Although Silu's breakthrough was only slightly earlier than Min Zhuo's, the difference in their inherited legacies was incomparable.  With just one companion beast, Silu showed signs of suppressing Min Zhuo.</p><p>Min Zhuo's main concern was actually Qin Sang, and he focused most of his energy on defending against the Azure Bird apparition.  As expected, after Si Lu entangled the jade bowl, the Azure Bird apparition effortlessly pierced the torrent.  The intense blue light stung Min Zhuo's eyes.</p><p>Min Zhuo's clan did possess inherited treasures, but he hadn't fully mastered the one he was using, having refined it for a short time. Even if he had, he had little confidence against the Azure Bird apparition.</p><p>Fortunately, Zai Zhen finally stopped watching and intervened.  He opened his mouth to speak, but seeing the overwhelming power of the Azure Bird apparition, and fearing for Min Zhuo's life, he quickly released three golden orbs.</p><p>These were the Three Suffering Rings, capable of binding opponents.  Trapped within them, enemies would be bound like they had three chains, suffering greatly and struggling to break free.</p><p>To Zai Zhen's surprise, the Azure Bird apparition merely glanced at the rings with disdain and violently flapped its wings.  A potent blue light erupted, interwoven with unusually deep, heavy-looking thunder threads unlike the apparition’s usual lightning. This was Qin Sang’s Azure Bird True Lightning, infused beforehand. Even without artifacts, the apparition was immensely powerful with it.</p><p>With this True Lightning activated, the Azure Bird apparition blazed with light.  Min Zhuo and Zai Zhen only saw a flash of blue lightning that expertly weaved between the three rings. Its speed far exceeded their expectations; the rings were easily bypassed, and the distance between the apparition and Min Zhuo drastically shortened.</p><p>Min Zhuo felt the apparition was upon him, horrified.  Zai Zhen's arrival had made things far worse.  Min Zhuo's bracelet glowed, unleashing eight beams of white light forming jade screens, each depicting similar scenes of rivers, lakes, and seas.  He tried to block the apparition but overlooked another enemy.</p><p>The sky had become a sea of fire, from which a white weasel emerged, dividing and multiplying into sixty-four, surrounding Min Zhuo in a formation, making him feel heavy and drowsy. With the apparition closing in, Min Zhuo’s situation was dire.</p><p>"I'll stop the bird!" Zai Zhen urgently transmitted, throwing another artifact. It resembled neither wood nor metal, a dark, square piece like bark, deeply etched with simple yet profound markings.</p><p>Recognizing it as akin to a human spirit talisman, Qin Sang understood its nature. The bark spontaneously combusted, releasing unusual flames and golden liquid that formed a large circular golden pattern.  This enormous golden diagram featured a giant golden hand reaching for the apparition, dwarfing it in comparison.</p><p>The apparition, unfazed, let out a cry, its thunder threads surging into its claws, forming lightning talons. The golden hand was blasted, but the apparition continued its attack on Min Zhuo.</p><p>At the critical moment, a dark golden short spear shot from the sea, colliding with the lightning claws, halting the apparition's assault.  </p><p>Another person was here. The apparition looked towards the horizon.</p><p>Zai Zhen breathed a sigh of relief, saying darkly, "Min Zhuo called for help; I didn't believe anyone would dare make trouble here, but I was wrong!"</p>
