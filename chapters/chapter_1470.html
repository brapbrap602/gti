<h1>## Chapter 1462: Vajra Self-Mastery (4k, Two-in-One)</h1><p>The reason Tong Lingyu said so much was to make Qin Sang retreat in the face of difficulty. Revealing the matter of the *Tongbao* Incantation was an implicit warning to Qin Sang not to entertain wild fantasies, and that since Qin Sang cultivated techniques that were not of the Ice Path, he could not possibly gain the approval of a spirit treasure.</p><p>Tong Lingyu hadn't expected that one tenth of the power of the Four Serpent Mark (Four *Sheng She Yin*) would not cause Qin Sang too much trouble.</p><p>Most cultivators, upon witnessing this technique, would have already bowed their heads in defeat.</p><p>She was unwilling to go all out because, although the power of a spirit treasure was formidable, the consumption of True Essence (True *Yuan*) was equally terrifying. This was not the Profound Heaven Palace (Xuantian Gong), and she did not want to waste so much True Essence on a pointless struggle, adding to her own risks.</p><p>The sky filled with sparks of demonic fire, flying towards Qin Sang, gathering in front of him, and transforming back into a flame dragon, quietly prostrating at his feet, retracting its imposing aura.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, looking down at the demonic fire.</p><p>He recalled the sensation of confronting the Four Serpent Mark and secretly made an assessment.</p><p>Just now, he did not feel overwhelmed, and he had not yet reached his limit.</p><p>If what Tong Lingyu said was true, the power of the demonic fire controlled through the Fire Lotus and the Eighteen Demon Banners was slightly better than one tenth of the Four Serpent Mark's power, but it definitely could not withstand two tenths.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's last words should have been somewhat reserved.</p><p>If Tong Lingyu went all out, the Eighteen Demon Banners would not be able to directly contend with the Four Serpent Mark. His defeat would be a foregone conclusion.</p><p>There was indeed no need to continue fighting.</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that Qin Sang was afraid of Tong Lingyu.</p><p>A spirit treasure only represented a part of her strength. There were too many decisive factors in a cultivator's life-and-death struggle.</p><p>Although it was just a sparring match, a head-on confrontation, the Four Serpent Mark did not show too many changes, but it was clear that this was an offensive spirit treasure.</p><p>At least, with just the Four Serpent Mark, Tong Lingyu could not possibly catch up to and kill Qin Sang.</p><p>Extraordinary escape techniques were Qin Sang's confidence in facing other powerful experts.</p><p>Qin Sang could also sense some of Tong Lingyu's concerns, guessing that controlling a spirit treasure must be extremely draining on True Essence, which was one of the reasons why Nascent Soul stage (Yuanying qi) cultivators could not unleash the full power of a spirit treasure.</p><p>He just wondered, how much power could the Palace Lord of the Profound Heaven Palace personally unleash with the Four Serpent Mark?</p><p>Qin Sang flashed this thought, but did not ask, because he knew Tong Lingyu would definitely not answer.</p><p>He turned his thoughts back to himself, his gaze sweeping over the Demon Banners.</p><p>Originally, he had high expectations for the demonic fire essence sealed within the Demon Banners, even harboring many unrealistic fantasies.</p><p>He hadn't expected the gap between magical artifacts and spirit treasures to be so vast!</p><p>The Void Spirit Sect (Xu Ling Pai) and Bing Han might have been too optimistic about the difficulty of refining spirit treasures.</p><p>Estimating it this way...</p><p>If he refined the Netherworld Demonic Fire (Jiuyou Mohuo) essence sealed within the Eighteen Demon Banners into a Fire Lotus, due to refinement, the power might be comparable to a spirit treasureâ€”just a Divine Transformation (Hua Shen) level Divine Ability (Shen Tong).</p><p>This was just a rough deduction, after all, Qin Sang's attainment in the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* (Huo Zhong Jin Lian) was still shallow.</p><p>However, if he could complete the refinement before the Divine Transformation stage, this Divine Ability would be heaven-defying enough. Other Nascent Soul cultivators, even if they wielded spirit treasures, could only unleash a fraction of their power.</p><p>And he, relying on the Fire Lotus refined from the complete demonic fire essence, might even have a chance to fight a Divine Transformation stage cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang fantasized about that scene, then quickly calmed down and returned to reality, knowing that these were just beautiful daydreams. He had never seen a Divine Transformation stage cultivator, but he had witnessed the terror of a Demon Lord.</p><p>The difficulty of cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* was the highest among all his Divine Abilities. How long it would take to refine the demonic fire essence was still unknown.</p><p>By then, if the Fire Lotus's level exceeded his own cultivation, Qin Sang was not sure if he could wield it freely. If the consumption was as terrifying as a spirit treasure, it would be too disappointing.</p><p>The good news was that as the Fire Lotus improved, his Divine Sense (Shen Shi) would also rise accordingly, which should make a difference.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang remained silent for a long time, Tong Lingyu assumed he was shocked by the power of the spirit treasure and did not urge him. She secretly mobilized the True Essence within her body. If Qin Sang was still unconvinced, she would have to make a move.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang gathered his thoughts, looked up, his expression solemn, and cupped his hands, saying, "The power of a spirit treasure is beyond imagination. Qin is convinced and grateful for Dao Friend (Dao You) Tong's guidance."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang had indeed given up, Tong Lingyu's expression softened slightly, and she smiled, "Dao Friend Qin's banner treasure is second to none among the magical artifacts this Palace has seen. Given time, Dao Friend Qin will surely laugh proudly in the North Sea!"</p><p>"In the end, it's far inferior to a spirit treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head repeatedly, as if he had been dealt a heavy blow.</p><p>Tong Lingyu smiled and said nothing.</p><p>At this time, Liuli, seeing that the two had stopped, flew back from afar, standing quietly behind the Grand Elder, unable to resist looking at the Demon Banners surrounding Qin Sang.</p><p>She had long known the terror of spirit treasures, but only now did she understand that she had underestimated the power of Qin Sang's magical artifact. No wonder he was so confident.</p><p>"Does Dao Friend Qin have other matters to attend to? If not, shall we set off now and return to the Profound Heaven Palace?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu was eager to invite Qin Sang back to the Palace and quickly select a treasure to return the sacred artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and said, "Please wait a moment, the two of you. Qin still has some matters to arrange."</p><p>Leaving the two women behind, Qin Sang returned to Bright Pearl Island (Mingzhu Dao), first visiting True Person Yinquan (Yinquan Zhenren) to bid him farewell, promising to meet again in the future, and sending a letter to Tan Hao, informing him of his movements in code.</p><p>He told Tan Hao to cultivate in peace at the Ghost Mother's Cave Abode (Guimu Dongfu) and prepare to form his Nascent Soul. He could contact him if necessary.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang returned to the island and rejoined the two women.</p><p>The three of them set off together, flying eastward.</p><p>During the flight, Tong Lingyu suddenly took out an object from her mustard seed pouch (jiezi dai) and handed it to Liuli, "This Yinli Pearl (Yinli Zhu) was originally used to lure that evildoer to show itself and retrieve the sacred artifact. Now that Dao Friend Qin has returned the sacred artifact, your contribution cannot be ignored. This treasure is considered a reward from the sect to you."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it, not knowing what was unique about this treasure, and glanced sideways at Liuli.</p><p>But he saw that Liuli received the Yinli Pearl, her expression still didn't change much, and she couldn't see obvious joy, "Thank you, Grand Elder, for the reward."</p><p>"I'm a few hundred years younger than your master. I used to call your master Aunt Bing. Logically speaking, we are peers. You calling me Grand Elder makes me feel old."</p><p>Tong Lingyu was in a great mood and even had the mind to joke with Liuli.</p><p>Tong Lingyu wanted to tease this ice beauty, but seeing Liuli's sad expression, she quickly stopped and sighed softly, "Your master clearly had the qualifications of a Grand cultivator, but she unexpectedly died. Fortunately, she taught a disciple like you, who is even better than her master, which is considered not in vain in this life. This Palace is also suffering from cultivation deviation, and the hope of breaking through is slim. Otherwise, our Profound Heaven Palace should now have three Late stage cultivators. Looking back, it can be called a prosperous age."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at Liuli.</p><p>Tong Lingyu didn't even know that Liuli's master wasn't dead, trapped in the Violet Palace (Ziwei Gong) for hundreds of years, until the Violet Palace ascended, and her life and death were unknown.</p><p>Why did Liuli conceal it from the sect? Could there be other secrets?</p><p>Qin Sang silently withdrew his gaze. Not knowing the reason, it was better not to meddle in other people's business.</p><p>After comforting Liuli a few times, Tong Lingyu turned to Qin Sang and said, "Dao Friend Qin is going to be a guest elder of Listening Snow Tower (Tingxue Lou), so he will inevitably have dealings with Elder Mei and the others in the future. The less we meet now, the less likely we are to be exposed. In addition, the sacred artifact cannot be lost and must be sent back to the forbidden area as soon as possible. Why doesn't Dao Friend Qin travel with me first, and return to the Profound Heaven Palace as soon as possible."</p><p>Qin Sang had no objection, indicating that he would follow the host's arrangements.</p><p>Upon reaching the vicinity of the Profound Heaven Palace's residence, Tong Lingyu and Liuli left Qin Sang behind and went back to arrange things.</p><p>An hour later, Tong Lingyu returned. In order to conceal the relationship between Qin Sang and Liuli, Liuli secretly contacted the Grand Elder and did not accompany her this time.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to activate his escape technique and fly into the air.</p><p>But he saw Tong Lingyu untie a delicate fish whistle carved from coral from her right wrist, smiled at Qin Sang, put it between her rosy lips, and blew it lightly.</p><p>"This time we are traveling east, and the journey is long, so this can save some energy."</p><p>Tong Lingyu explained.</p><p>The sound of the fish whistle was crisp, melodious and pleasant.</p><p>Accompanied by the whistle, the fish whistle quietly melted, turning into a illusory big fish, like the soul of the big fish.</p><p>At this time, the silver hook had just risen.</p><p>The faint moonlight sprinkled on the empty sea, the water rippled slightly, the faint whistle sounded far away, exuding a unique stillness.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was attracted by the big fish's soul.</p><p>He saw that the big fish's soul was transparent, leaping from Tong Lingyu's fingertips, like a carp jumping over the dragon gate, lifelike and very lively, jumping into the sky at once.</p><p>It was as if the silver hook in the sky was a moon boat in the Milky Way, and it was going to jump onto the boat.</p><p>As the big fish's soul jumped, the sea was inexplicably attracted, silently rising upwards, the water flow being pulled by the big fish's soul, flowing against the current.</p><p>Before long, an inverted waterfall appeared in front of the two, flowing from the sea to the Milky Way.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, watching the big fish's soul shuttle through the waterfall comfortably, rising step by step in the air.</p><p>At the same time, the whistle always lingered in his ears.</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely felt that a strange wave spread from the big fish's soul to the distance. He could not understand what this wave represented.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly felt something and looked down at the sea.</p><p>He did not know when, but more and more fish were summoned and gathered towards them, some were strangely shaped, and some had gorgeous patterns. There were even many glowing fish, scattered in the fish school, countless, like the Milky Way shining into the mortal world.</p><p>Just as they were intoxicated by the dreamlike scenery.</p><p>The fish school suddenly became agitated, and two blue sharks swam in domineeringly, swimming around at their feet.</p><p>Tong Lingyu pointed to the big fish's soul, ready to move, when she suddenly heard an ethereal cry from a distance, as if a whisper from the deep sea.</p><p>"Whale song."</p><p>Tong Lingyu tilted her head to listen, and smiled, "Good luck, there are actually abyssal whales swimming nearby."</p><p>Qin Sang followed Tong Lingyu's gaze.</p><p>After a while, he first saw a huge water column, and a black shadow outline appeared on the sea, which was only a part of the behemoth under the water.</p><p>*Clatter!*</p><p>The big fish's soul flapped its tail and jumped out of the waterfall, its body turned into a ball of blue water.</p><p>The whistle disappeared.</p><p>The nearby fish lost their attraction, including the two blue sharks, and reluctantly dispersed. The abyssal whale swam over, and the water ball transformed by the big fish's soul merged into its head.</p><p>Then, Tong Lingyu took out a small chariot, threw it out, and the rope automatically wrapped around the abyssal whale's dorsal fin. The chariot was like a boat, stably parked on the water, hung behind the abyssal whale, and the treasure light flowed, merging with the abyssal whale.</p><p>"Dao Friend Qin, please!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu stretched out her hand to guide Qin Sang, Qin Sang flashed into the chariot, found a place to sit cross-legged.</p><p>Tong Lingyu whispered something to the abyssal whale, then took out a jade bottle, poured out a pill and fed it to it, gently patted the abyssal whale, and also boarded the chariot.</p><p>*Hua!*</p><p>The abyssal whale turned around, setting off huge waves, heading straight east, at an amazing speed.</p><p>The chariot was extremely stable, and seawater could not invade the chariot at all.</p><p>Tong Lingyu nodded with satisfaction, reached out and grabbed outwards, scooping up the moonlight, gently smoothing it, turning it into a layer of light yarn, hanging in front of the window, blocking the prying eyes outside.</p><p>Qin Sang was happy to be relaxed. Presumably no one would dare to block the driver halfway. He said goodbye to Tong Lingyu, placed a barrier around him, ordered the Heavenly Eye Butterfly (Tianmu Die) to be vigilant, and immediately took out a jade slip, and his divine sense penetrated into it, and there was no sound.</p><p>Tong Lingyu did not take offense, and also arranged the light gauze formation, closing her eyes and meditating quietly.</p><p>Under the moonlight.</p><p>Only the abyssal whale broke through the waves, and the whale song and the sound of the waves played a beautiful movement.</p><p>...</p><p>The content in the jade slip was the *Seven Teachers Buddha Seal* (*Qi Shi Fo Yin*).</p><p>This place was far away from the Hidden Sun Realm (Yinri Jing), and could not be reached overnight. Qin Sang finally had time to comprehend this Body Cultivation (Ti Xiu) Divine Ability.</p><p>He had previously glanced at it roughly.</p><p>At this time, he still started from the beginning, but began to deliberate on each word and comprehend it carefully.</p><p>He cultivated a Demonic Race (Yao Zu) Body Refining technique, which was very different from the Human Race technique. He knew nothing about the Human Race Body Cultivation Divine Ability. Now, comprehending it was like entering an unfamiliar field, which was quite difficult.</p><p>The seven Buddha Seals of the *Seven Teachers Buddha Seal* were seven moves.</p><p>However, this Divine Ability required the use of Buddhist hand seals to mobilize the power of the physical body.</p><p>The general outline said: hand tie the covenant seal, mouth chant the mantra, and heart observe the Buddha.</p><p>This statement contained the true meaning, and was the key to comprehending the *Seven Teachers Buddha Seal*. Qin Sang could only comprehend the superficial at this time.</p><p>He understood the covenant seal and the mantra, but what made him a little strange was 'heart observes the Buddha'. What he observed was not the well-known Buddha Bodhisattva, but a vague Buddha statue.</p><p>He did not understand why, but he had to keep it in mind and continue to look at the back.</p><p>The first seal of the *Seven Teachers Buddha Seal*, the Auspicious Seal (Jixiang Yin), could be barely cultivated by a Golden Core stage (Jindan qi) Body Cultivator, because this seal was not extremely domineering and would not backlash itself. It was the beginning of the seven seals, and the most important function was to mobilize the blood throughout the body to fight the enemy in the peak state, but its power was barely satisfactory.</p><p>Qin Sang was now at the early stage of the fourth level of the Heavenly Demon Transformation (Tian Yao Bian), and could cultivate the first four seals. The other three seals were called Lotus Seal (Lianhua Yin), Mandala Seal (Luntan Yin), and Demon-Destroying Seal (Cuimo Yin). The seal formulas were different, but they were of the same lineage, and their power increased step by step. They were all killing seals.</p><p>Qin Sang could see some mysteries in these four seals.</p><p>As for the last three seals, he could only memorize them completely now, and had no clue at all. They were called Vajra Great Wisdom Seal (Jingang Dahui Yin), Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal (Jingang Tianzhou Yin), and Vajra Self-Mastery Seal! (Jingang Zizai Yin)</p><p>"According to legend, the Vajra of Buddhism is a solid and indestructible person, but I don't know if these last three seals are worthy of their names."</p><p>Qin Sang said to himself in his heart, and put his sight back on the first four seals.</p><p>Although he was not a Buddhist, his cultivation was high enough. Once he understood the true meaning of the Divine Ability, the difficulty of comprehending the first seal was not high, but he was distressed that Tong Lingyu was by his side and had no chance to practice.</p><p>Herding the whale.</p><p>The abyssal whale traveled non-stop, not knowing how many miles it had traveled in the boundless sea.</p><p>Qin Sang was immersed in the *Seven Teachers Buddha Seal*, and felt more and more that the Divine Ability was exquisite, which opened his eyes, and even made him reverse his own seal, and had more understanding of Body Refining.</p><p>Cultivation does not know the day.</p><p>This day.</p><p>Qin Sang was awakened by the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, felt the restriction was touched, and heard Tong Lingyu's voice: "Dao Friend Qin, we will be ashore soon."</p>
