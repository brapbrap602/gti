<h1>Chapter 1251: The Black Tower Formation</h1><p>"Where is the Old Demon Ye?"  </p><p>The crowd was stunned.  </p><p>The Nether Demon Lord pointed at the blood gate and said urgently, "We're a step too late. The Old Demon Ye has already broken through the gate. Just now, there were fluctuations from behind the blood gate, likely from the Old Demon Ye dismantling the ancient restrictions inside. Then, the fluctuations suddenly vanished. I don't know if they've succeeded. Time is of the essence, fellow Daoists, assist me at once!"  </p><p>Hearing this, everyone was alarmed and quickly gathered around the Nether Demon Lord, sitting in a circle to jointly attack the blood gate.  </p><p>The blood gate appeared dilapidated, shaking violently with each strike, yet it remained extraordinarily sturdy.  </p><p>The runes on the blood gate flickered, though many were incomplete. Despite the attacks, they absorbed and neutralized most of the force. Less than ten percent of the power actually struck the gate itself.  </p><p>If the ancient restrictions were intact, even the combined strength of cultivators from three realms wouldn't be enough to break through.  </p><p>The Nether Demon Lord had been testing the gate and had gained some understanding of its restrictions. Qin Sang also offered timely advice. After some exploration, they found the weakest point and began a relentless assault.  </p><p>As they attacked the blood gate, the area behind it remained eerily silent. No one knew what the Old Demon Ye and his group were up to, which only added to their anxiety.  </p><p>However, the towering black towers behind the gate were mysterious and clearly different from the surroundings. They were no ordinary structures, and the Sin Abyss couldn't be allowed to monopolize them.  </p><p>Even if they couldn't stop the Old Demon Ye, getting a share of the spoils and reaping some benefits would make the journey worthwhile.  </p><p>With varied thoughts, everyone focused their efforts on attacking the blood gate.  </p><p>Qin Sang activated his Ebony Sword, splitting it into countless sword lights that poured out like a galaxy, continuously bombarding the blood gate. The sight was awe-inspiring.  </p><p>Many had heard of the Moonlight Demon King's exceptional swordsmanship, and now they witnessed it firsthand. Among the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Cold Domain, there were a few skilled swordsmen, but compared to Qin Sang's display, they could only feel inferior.  </p><p>Qin Sang's sword intent stemmed from the path of slaughter, yet it encompassed myriad aspects.  </p><p>Such swordsmanship was unprecedented and unheard of. No one knew who this demon king had learned it from.  </p><p>Unaware of their thoughts, Qin Sang silently activated his Heavenly Eye, peering through the cracks in the blood gate to observe the scene beyond.  </p><p>The blood mist was thick as paste.  </p><p>The black towers seemed to float in a sea of blood.  </p><p>In the sealed space of the blood lake, everything else had been assimilated by the blood mist over countless years, turning into a bloody hue.  </p><p>But the black towers, made of an unknown material, remained pitch black and strikingly conspicuous.  </p><p>The black towers stood a thousand zhang tall, constructed from square stone blocks. Their surfaces were rough, and whether due to the material's nature or some divine concealment, Qin Sang saw no runes or phenomena like blood lightning or yin winds.  </p><p>The black dots he had seen earlier from outside were likely the tips of these towers.  </p><p>As Qin Sang pondered the purpose of these black towers, he suddenly heard cheers. The blood gate, after shaking violently, slowly opened a crack.  </p><p>The Nether Demon Lord darted to the crack.  </p><p>Confirming there were no ambushes, everyone filed in.  </p><p>Standing among the black towers, they felt incredibly small, silently marveling at the sight. They then quickly used their abilities to search for traces of the Old Demon Ye and his group, but found nothing.  </p><p>The place seemed eerily calm, with the blood mist motionless, as if no one had ever entered.  </p><p>Qin Sang observed silently, still seeing no signs of ancient restrictions. In fact, it seemed safer than other areas.  </p><p>"The Old Demon Ye and his group must have entered one of the black towers..." the Nether Demon Lord said gravely.  </p><p>Everyone exchanged glances and chose a nearby black tower to investigate. However, as soon as they moved, a few exclamations rang out.  </p><p>Those who tried to fly up were suppressed after rising less than three zhang. An invisible force pressed down on them, nearly causing them to tumble.  </p><p>Fortunately, their high cultivation and quick reflexes saved them from embarrassment.  </p><p>"There are restrictions here that we can't detect..."  </p><p>They had no choice but to stay grounded. Just as this thought crossed their minds, another change occurred!  </p><p>'Whoosh...'  </p><p>A fierce wind rose from the ground, and the thick blood mist surged toward them like a tidal wave.  </p><p>Everyone quickly summoned their protective treasures.  </p><p>Qin Sang enveloped himself in sword light, with the Ebony Sword hovering above his head.  </p><p>As soon as he prepared, the scenery before his eyes shifted rapidly, followed by a dizzying sensation. When he regained his senses, he was shocked to find that Qing Jun and the others had vanished.  </p><p>He now stood in a sea of blood, with the shadows of the black towers clearly visible.  </p><p>These towers seemed within reach, yet infinitely distant. With each step he took, the towers receded, forever out of reach.  </p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang understood. They had unknowingly fallen into a grand formation, one that utilized the black towers.  </p><p>The methods of ancient cultivators were indeed profound. The formation was set here without a trace, and they had fallen into it without noticing.  </p><p>Trapped in an unknown formation, Qin Sang remained calm and unflustered.  </p><p>After entering the blood gate, he had noticed that the black towers, like the gate, were damaged. Many towers had collapsed, leaving only half-standing remnants.  </p><p>With the towers damaged, the formation's power would be weakened, full of flaws.  </p><p>If the Old Demon Ye could handle it, there was no reason they couldn't.  </p><p>Qin Sang steadied his mind and carefully observed, soon spotting several flaws. His confidence grew.  </p><p>The only trouble was that within the formation, finding the Old Demon Ye and his group would be even harder.  </p><p>He took out a sword talisman.  </p><p>They had prepared for various scenarios, and this sword talisman's crafting method was obtained from an ancient battlefield ruin. It required many precious materials, making it something few would bother to create.  </p><p>The sword case was with the Nether Demon Lord, and the sword wielder could sense his location and move toward him.  </p><p>This flawed formation couldn't block the talisman's perception.  </p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to activate the talisman, he paused and summoned Fat Chicken.  </p><p>Fat Chicken emerged, startled by the formation, and obediently stayed close to Qin Sang. Even a damaged formation could easily trap it.  </p><p>"Try the Thunder Bead. If your mother isn't here, in the core of the blood lake, then..."  </p><p>Qin Sang sighed.  </p><p>This place was sealed by the blood gate, and it took their combined efforts to open a crack. The Thunder Falcon Demon King, entering alone back then, would have had no chance of breaking through.  </p><p>"Yes!"  </p><p>Fat Chicken silently prayed, anxious, and summoned the Thunder Bead. It closed its eyes and began chanting.  </p><p>The Thunder Bead floated above its head, slowly rotating.  </p><p>As Fat Chicken activated the secret technique, the Thunder Bead began to emit a faint white light. The light started weak but gradually grew brighter, forming a fist-sized orb.  </p><p>Within the orb, faint threads of lightning danced.  </p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. Since entering the blood lake, Fat Chicken had tried countless times, but this was the first time the Thunder Bead had shown such a reaction!</p>
