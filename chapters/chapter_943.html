<h1>Chapter 935: The Deal</h1><p>Hearing Bai’s self-justification, Qin Sang's heart stirred. It seemed he wasn't the first cultivator to discover the Netherfire.</p><p>This was normal. Although the Ghostlands' location was hidden, the Seven Kills Sect had opened it countless times, and innumerable cultivators had entered. Unless it was a truly forbidden zone, every corner would have been explored long ago.</p><p>Among them were late-stage Core Formation grand cultivators.  They possessed treasures that could resist the purple mist's poison and could venture deep into this place. It wasn't surprising.</p><p>However, listening to Bai's tone, Qin Sang seemed to be the first person capable of passing through the Netherfire and entering the Ghostlands.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced as he charged into the ghostly mist, using his sword wheel to clear the path.  His avatar and the Twin-Headed Hound followed closely.</p><p>Qin Sang, accompanied by his avatar and the Twin-Headed Hound, used words to stall Bai while searching for his true body, waiting for the right moment to strike.</p><p>Finally, the Skyeye Butterfly locked onto Bai's location.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm and, without hesitation, activated the *Thunder Control Technique*.</p><p>Bai, manipulating the ghostly mist, had his power greatly amplified. However, the *Thunder Control Technique* commanded the most yang and powerful force of thunder, which had a certain restraining effect on ghostly beings.</p><p>The *Thunder Control Technique* could not only break the ghostly mist, but the Bai within it would also be unable to escape.</p><p>Using the *Thunder Control Technique* might severely injure or even destroy the Nightflyer Yaksha, but Qin Sang wouldn't hesitate. Compared to the Nightflyer Yaksha, the Ten Yama King Banner was clearly more important.</p><p>Bai took the initiative to propose a deal. Qin Sang had to admit, he was indeed somewhat tempted.</p><p>This person was likely an old monster who had lived since ancient times. Even if he had lost his memory, anything he inadvertently recalled might involve earth-shattering secrets, which would be of great use to Qin Sang’s future cultivation path.</p><p>But making such a deal wasn't Qin Sang's desire.</p><p>Presumably, Bai had similar thoughts. Otherwise, he would have appeared openly and negotiated directly from the beginning.</p><p>Bai certainly didn't expect that Qin Sang’s strength far exceeded his expectations. Even harnessing the power of the ghostly mist and resentful souls couldn’t suppress him. He had no choice but to propose a deal under the banner of mutual benefit.</p><p>Furthermore, the Eighteen Demonic Banners were what Qin Sang valued most. One was a vague and uncertain deal; the other was a top-grade magical treasure within his grasp. He would choose the latter.</p><p>‘Crackle!’</p><p>As the *Thunder Control Technique* neared completion, electric arcs flickered and crackled around Qin Sang.</p><p>The surrounding ghostly mist and spirits recoiled in terror as if encountering their nemesis.</p><p>“What kind of secret technique are you using?”</p><p>Bai sensed something amiss, feeling alarmed, and cried out.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered silently, his hands forming seals, swiftly executing the secret technique.</p><p>The might of the *Thunder Control Technique* began to manifest.  Electric light flickered around Qin Sang, bathing him in thunder, as a continuous stream of thunder power surged towards his fingertips.</p><p>And the point where his fingertip aimed was precisely Bai’s hiding place.</p><p>Qin Sang had refined the *Thunder Control Technique* by challenging heavenly thunder during a storm.</p><p>But the thunder he controlled now was different from heavenly thunder. Not only was its power incomparable to heavenly thunder, but because of the presence of baleful star energy, it also had a faint darkness and eerieness, lacking the brilliance of heavenly thunder.</p><p>Even so, the *Thunder Control Technique* cast by Qin Sang wasn't something a Core Formation cultivator could withstand.</p><p>“Wooo…”</p><p>The resentful souls within the ghostly mist sensed the danger and grew restless.</p><p>At this moment, Bai's eyes lost all traces of composure. He had initially believed he could at least fight Qin Sang to a standstill, so he had been fearless.</p><p>Now he realized that Qin Sang actually possessed the means to defeat or even kill him.</p><p>Bai's face paled in fright as he frantically darted back and forth within the ghostly mist, attempting to confuse Qin Sang's judgment.</p><p>But he had already been locked onto by Qin Sang, completely exposed under the Skyeye Butterfly’s Skyeye divine ability. His efforts were doomed to be futile.</p><p>“Stop! I surrender!”</p><p>Bai shrieked.</p><p>Qin Sang remained deaf to his pleas, his hand seals changing rapidly.</p><p>Deep within the Ghostlands, thunder rumbled.</p><p>Qin Sang, with phoenix wings sprouting from his back, hovered in the air, his robes fluttering, his gaze cold. Commanding the thunder, he possessed a certain aura of purging evil spirits and clarifying the world.</p><p>Of course, he didn't possess such great power yet. At most, he could only eliminate Bai and some of the surrounding resentful souls.</p><p>Locked onto by the thunder, Bai felt a sense of impending doom. Truly panicked, he shouted repeatedly, “If you dare to kill me, you won't survive either! Outside the Netherfire, your great enemy lies in wait.  Going out will be a dead end for you!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe his lies at all.</p><p>Currently, the only ones who could kill him were Nascent Soul ancestors.</p><p>He believed he had acted with extreme caution. Although he had offended two Nascent Soul ancestors, he hadn't left any evidence. He had been hiding for decades. How could they possibly find him here?</p><p>Therefore, he remained unmoved, watching as the secret technique neared completion.</p><p>“Don’t you have a detection secret technique? If you don’t believe me, go outside and see. That person is lurking outside the Netherfire right now! And it’s a Nascent Soul cultivator! Only I can help you escape and survive this tribulation!”</p><p>Bai wished he had more mouths to speak with. Seeing that Qin Sang was still stubborn, he nearly ground the Nightflyer Yaksha’s steel teeth, his voice becoming sharp.</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang's eyes flickered, his hand seals pausing slightly, a look of uncertainty appearing on his face.</p><p>Bai’s tone didn't sound fake. Could there really be a powerful enemy watching?</p><p>The canyon was the only entrance to the Ghostlands.</p><p>One man could hold the pass against ten thousand.</p><p>If it was truly as Bai said, and a Nascent Soul ancestor was guarding the canyon, he would be trapped.</p><p>He had clearly hidden himself well, never revealing any clues. Outsiders couldn't possibly know he had his eye on the Netherfire. Who exactly was waiting outside?</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's momentum ease, Bai couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. Fearing Qin Sang might change his mind, he quickly swore an oath, “The Ghostlands are only this big. Even if I could deceive you for a while, could I deceive you forever? Where else could I escape to? If I’ve uttered a single falsehood, I'm willing to offer my neck to the blade!”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, staring into the depths of the ghostly mist for a long time before saying indifferently, “Disperse the ghostly mist first. I agree to spare your life for now.”</p><p>Bai remained silent for a moment before agreeing to the demand.</p><p>With a loud ‘boom’, the ghostly mist scattered, and the resentful souls regained their freedom, causing another commotion.</p><p>Now, Bai stood alone before Qin Sang, calmly meeting his gaze.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Bai's eyes for a good while, then lightly flicked his arm. The electric light surrounding his body slowly dissipated, and the power of thunder retreated back into him.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai's tense heart finally relaxed. "The deal I talked about with you before was this… It seems I can only let you see for yourself to believe me. That person is waiting outside the Netherfire right now. I'll use the ghostly mist to conceal our presence. Go see for yourself…"</p><p>Bai was tactful and didn't make any misleading moves, taking the initiative to move towards the entrance of the Ghostlands.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment before following closely behind. However, he kept the *Thunder Control Technique* at the ready, prepared to instantly kill Bai if he made any suspicious moves.</p><p>Before long, the two arrived at the Netherfire.</p><p>After a gesture from Bai, a wisp of ghostly mist gathered towards Qin Sang, concealing his form and aura.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly approached, pressing himself against the stone wall, and commanded the Skyeye Butterfly to look outside.</p><p>No one was there.</p>
