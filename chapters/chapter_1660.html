<h1>Chapter 1651: The Yan Flame Divine Prohibition</h1><p>Chapter 1651: The Yan Flame Divine Prohibition</p><p>Thunder roared like drums.</p><p>Through his celestial vision, Qin Sang ‘saw’ behind him a purple light soaring into the sky, countless electric serpents writhing in the clouds, almost forming a thunderous realm, occasionally punctuated by the earth-shattering cries of cranes echoing across the land.  Zi Lei Zhenren and He Gao Zhenren’s attack was earth-shattering.</p><p>Then, the purple light suddenly dimmed.  Black lotuses continuously bloomed and withered amidst the thunder, a sign of Fan Laomo’s intervention; it seemed Zhu Wu Dao had persuaded him with some offer.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome, Qin Sang couldn't afford to worry about others right now.  He needed to evade his pursuers.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao seemed determined to hunt him down, pursuing relentlessly.</p><p>Their escape techniques were inferior to Qin Sang's, and the distance between them gradually widened. However, Mount Disu was not infinitely vast.  The air-prohibiting sword incessantly patrolled, and the mountain was riddled with restrictions.</p><p>Here, Qin Sang could not fully utilize his escape techniques. Shaking them off would take considerable effort.</p><p>If it were only Su Zinan, Qin Sang wouldn't mind finding a place to fight him. He was riding high after slaying two Grand Cultivators.</p><p>While his opponents were two, the situation differed from before.</p><p>Previously, he and his doppelganger had combined forces, utilizing the remnants of the Ice Palace array, leveraging favorable terrain and employing an ambush. They had succeeded because there were no external interferences during combat.</p><p>He was completely unfamiliar with Mount Disu. Where could he find advantageous terrain?</p><p>Moreover, his doppelganger hadn't arrived yet.</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely sensed that his doppelganger, seizing the opportunity during the shifting of the mountain, had entered the grand formation and was striving to reach his main body.  However, even with Zhu Wu Dao's tampering, the Mount Disu grand formation was not easily breached, and he couldn't rely on his doppelganger for the moment.</p><p>“I need to get rid of them first…”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed. As his thoughts raced, he discovered that the clouds ahead were gradually thinning, allowing him to finally see the features of the divine mountain.</p><p>The most striking feature was the celestial jade staircase, ascending directly into the heavens, resembling a ladder to the sky.</p><p>According to Zhu Wu Dao, the inscriptionless jade tablet was located at the top of the staircase, the summit of Mount Disu.</p><p>On either side of the staircase were numerous pavilions, terraces, clear springs, and waterfalls, a scene of fairy-like beauty. If not for the current disruption of the grand formation and the breach of Mount Disu’s tranquility, it would be an ideal place for seclusion.</p><p>However, the staircase didn't begin at the foot of the mountain but halfway up.</p><p>From Qin Sang’s position, even with the keen eyesight of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, he couldn't discern the beginning of the staircase, because a strange region lay in between: a multicolored area, with swirling clouds and mist forming a colorful ring around the peak, blocking all perception.</p><p>Below this region was a white jade plaza, from which numerous staircases snaked downwards, each seemingly leading directly down the mountain.</p><p>精舍 and ancient halls were also built along these staircases, but their grandeur was significantly inferior to those above.</p><p>These staircases commemorated the ascents of the ancestors of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, each staircase corresponding to a jade gate, created upon the appearance of a great virtuous person.</p><p>Qin Sang, unaware of the details, found it strange that the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect would build so many useless staircases.  However, he didn't dwell on this, instead focusing his attention on the strange region between the plaza and the halls.</p><p>It was called ‘strange’ because even with Qin Sang's cultivation and knowledge, he couldn't accurately determine the extent of that region.  While its boundaries were distinct, its interior seemed boundless.</p><p>This contradictory feeling was not an illusion, Qin Sang knew.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>An escaping light pierced through the clouds and landed on the plaza, revealing Qin Sang's figure.</p><p>He quickly scanned the strange region. In the multicolored clouds, various strange lights intertwined, their aura extremely sharp and formidable.</p><p>Although the inner light constantly shifted, upon closer inspection, one could distinguish that some areas within the deep clouds possessed a unified color—unfathomably deep and certainly no benign place.</p><p>A piercing sound of tearing air came from behind.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, meeting Su Zinan's gloomy gaze.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s path blocked, Su Zinan sneered, “I’ll see how much further you can run!”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. “I have no deep hatred with Daoist Su. Why the relentless pursuit?”</p><p>As he spoke, he used his spiritual sense and celestial vision to sense the changes in the aura within the light and shadow.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Su Zinan coldly snorted, his killing intent undiminished, pressing relentlessly.  “Hand over the treasure you stole from the snow plains, and I might consider sparing your life!”</p><p>He inwardly regretted that he hadn't seized the opportunity when Qin Sang was surrounded by four people, inadvertently revealing his killing intent towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang feigned surprise, laughing derisively.  "Does Lu Ye consider that tomb his personal treasure? I entered the snowfield openly years ago.  You are not a descendant of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, so what right do you have to demand treasures from me! Besides, even if you were to kill and steal, you've got the wrong person. You should be looking for Yan Shan Lao Ren. He is the true inheritor of the Water Phase, lurking near the snowfield for many years.  He tricked me back then, and stole the treasures from the tomb."</p><p>Su Zinan sneered repeatedly. "Back then, even Old Wu wasn't your match. Yan Shan is merely a mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator. He's easily handled. Enough talk. Hand over the treasures!"</p><p>"A worthy successor to the Transformation God Stage. Quite impressive!"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed angrily.</p><p>Before the laughter subsided, Qin Sang transformed into a bolt of lightning, passing through the plaza and diving into the strange clouds.</p><p>Seeing his decisive action, Su Zinan was slightly stunned, his expression turning dark. He signaled Mo Xingdao to pursue, but Mo Xingdao stopped at the edge of the clouds.</p><p>"Daoist Mo?"</p><p>Su Zinan's gaze was sharp, his brow furrowed.</p><p>Mo Xingdao stared at the clouds, saying gravely, "This place's divine prohibitions and the Emperor-Bestowed Mountain Formation's energies are connected. Judging by the appearance of the clouds, it's far more dangerous than the outer mists. This person is proficient in lightning escape techniques and surpasses Old Wu in ability.  Without the help of Fan Lao Mo, it's impossible to stop him. Are you sure you want to pursue, Daoist Su?"</p><p>"I didn't expect Daoist Mo to be so skilled in formations and prohibitions," Su Zinan's expression softened. "He's here for the first time, just like us, with no knowledge of this place. Although his escape technique is strong, the clouds don't offer much room for him to utilize it. It's the perfect chance to eliminate him. Once he leaves, it will be truly like releasing a tiger back into the mountains, and no one can control him. I won't act recklessly and put you in danger, Daoist Mo. I'll handle his abilities, and you can be ready for a killing blow!"</p><p>Seeing Su Zinan's confident tone, Mo Xingdao remained doubtful, but eventually followed Su Zinan in pursuit of Qin Sang, disappearing into the depths of the clouds.</p><p>The three of them left, one after the other.</p><p>At the edge of the plaza, two Yu Tai Sect disciples emerged from a dilapidated dwelling.</p><p>"What incredible speed!"</p><p>The white-robed Daoist wiped his sweat. They had been hiding, intending to enter the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, but luckily they reacted quickly and hid, or they would have been discovered.</p><p>Whether the three would continue fighting or agree to a truce and capture them first for questioning was uncertain.</p><p>The female cultivator looked towards the clouds, identifying the direction according to her senior brother's instructions, then showed a worried expression. "Senior brother, the direction they're heading seems to be the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition area. What do we do?"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Finally sorted out the outline. It was too late to start writing after figuring things out today, so I only managed one chapter.</p>
