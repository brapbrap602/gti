<h1>Chapter 1127: The Alliance Meeting</h1><p>The Celestial Peak's Star Origin Stone was the key to setting up the Minor North Star Origin Formation, which was essential for entering the Purple Palace. In the past, the Cold Domain and the Heavenly Path Alliance had chosen the Celestial Peak as their battleground, deciding who would provide the other spiritual materials needed for the formation. Qin Sang had secretly brought Senior Sister Qingjun inside, ambushing the elders of the Illusory Mist Sect and discovering that there was a teleportation array hidden within, leading to another immortal manor. That immortal manor had previously been controlled by the Illusory Mist Sect, but it was likely now in Senior Sister Qingjun's hands.</p><p>They arrived at the tomb. After paying their respects, they returned to the wooden cabin.</p><p>Qingjun said, "The immortal manor and the teleportation array are still there, but entering the Celestial Peak won't be easy. We must wait for both domains to jointly decide to lift the Celestial Peak's restrictions before the teleportation array can be activated. The 'key' to unlocking the Celestial Peak's restrictions isn't held by just one or two factions; everyone must agree..."</p><p>"Is that so..." Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>No wonder Qingjun had been so confident back then that she could ambush the Illusory Mist Sect's members at the Celestial Peak. They, too, had to wait for the restrictions to be lifted before they could enter and steal the Star Origin Stone.</p><p>"I wonder if the two domains will organize another duel to retrieve the Star Origin Stone early?" Qin Sang pondered for a moment before asking.</p><p>Qingjun shook her head. "In their joint effort to resist the Sin Abyss, the two domains no longer want internal conflicts and have decided to abolish the rules of dueling. The last time the Purple Palace emerged, they jointly opened the Celestial Peak to retrieve the Star Origin Stone. The spiritual materials needed for the formation were also split evenly between the two domains. Unless there's a new opportunity in the future, it's unlikely to change."</p><p>"This..." This was completely unexpected for Qin Sang. He hadn't realized there would be so many complications in entering the Celestial Peak. If they had to wait until the next emergence of the Purple Palace to sneak into the Celestial Peak, it could take many years. Although the Purple Palace had recently shown signs of change, with the intervals between its appearances shortening, the pattern was still unpredictable. Even if they took the shortest interval, it would still be over a hundred and thirty yearsâ€”the same amount of time he had been trapped in the Canglang Sea. He had only returned less than thirty years ago. His cultivation was about to reach the peak of the Golden Core stage. Could he really afford to wait a hundred years for the Elixir of Calamity?</p><p>"Have there been any signs of spiritual tides in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield recently?" Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>Previously, the intervals between the Purple Palace's appearances had been getting shorter. Could it emerge even earlier this time?</p><p>Qingjun seemed to read Qin Sang's thoughts and said, "We've had similar speculations. We've been monitoring the changes in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, but there's no news yet. It probably won't be as soon as we hope. However, if the Celestial Peak isn't the only option, there might be another way. It just depends on whether you have the courage..."</p><p>Qingjun's tone suddenly shifted, as if she had thought of something, her words carrying a deeper meaning.</p><p>Qingjun pointed at Qin Sang. "Do you remember when the two domains' cultivators were ambushed by the Sin Abyss at the outer formation of the Purple Palace? If it weren't for you and that disciple of the Supreme Unity Pill Sect warning us in advance and exposing the traitorous identity of the Infinite Gate Master, the two domains would have suffered heavy losses. The Sin Abyss might have already taken over. Regardless, the cultivators of both domains must acknowledge your contributions, including me. I owe you this favor. Back in the Purple Palace, they decided to reward the two of you. That Supreme Unity Pill Sect disciple used his merit to repay his sect. You went missing in the Purple Palace, and I doubt Elder Dongyang had the face to claim your merit. Later, the matter was dropped. Too much time has passed, and circumstances have changed. It's unlikely you can exchange this for much benefit now. However, getting them to agree to open the Celestial Peak and let you absorb the Star Origin Energy should be possible. Since the inner palace formation of the Purple Palace underwent a strange transformation, the power of the outer formation has also greatly diminished. In the future, it might be possible to enter the Purple Palace without the Minor North Star Origin Formation, making the Celestial Peak less important. The Sin Abyss is starting to stir again, and the two domains are planning to hold an alliance meeting at Cangheng Island in the Yun Cang Great Marsh to discuss resistance. I returned for this very reason. You can come with me."</p><p>After speaking, Qingjun looked at Qin Sang with a smile, her eyes slightly playful, as if waiting to see his reaction. This kind of expression was something she had never shown before, but it suited her youthful appearance well.</p><p>Cangheng Island was a large island in the Yun Cang Great Marsh. It had originally been an obscure place, but after the two domains formed an alliance, Cangheng Island happened to be located between their territories and was chosen as the meeting place. As relations between the two domains thawed, trade between their cultivators opened up, and Cangheng Island quickly developed into a sizable city, becoming increasingly prosperous in recent years.</p><p>"Will Elder Dongyang be there?" Qin Sang asked with a bitter smile, understanding why Qingjun had brought this up. He hadn't reached the Nascent Soul stage yet, and showing up in front of Elder Dongyang now would be like walking into a trap.</p><p>Qingjun nodded. "Shortly after leaving the Purple Palace last time, Elder Dongyang's cultivation improved significantly. Although Grandmaster Chongyi has nurtured two Nascent Soul successors for the Supreme Unity Pill Sect, he himself hasn't made any progress in years. In the Cold Domain, Elder Dongyang's strength is second only to the Nether Demon. He's considered the leader of the righteous path, so of course he'll attend."</p><p>"How do you compare to Elder Dongyang, Senior Sister?" Qin Sang asked curiously, seeing that Qingjun was in a good mood.</p><p>He still couldn't see through Qingjun's true strength. Elder Dongyang's power also filled him with awe, which explained why Shao Hua Mountain's status had been rising. Elder Dongyang's current cultivation was undoubtedly at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, making him the strongest in the righteous path. Such a formidable enemy meant Qin Sang would have to wait until he reached the Nascent Soul stage before he could show himself openly.</p><p>Qingjun smiled without answering. "From what I know of Elder Dongyang, there's probably something fishy about his recent breakthrough. We'll just have to wait and see. If you stay by my side, he won't dare to attack you publicly. You're now an elder of the Illusory Mist Sect. After returning, go to the Illusory Mist Sect to cultivate and focus on preparing for your Nascent Soul breakthrough. Elder Dongyang's teaching skills are far inferior to Grandmaster Chongyi's. None of his disciples have reached the Nascent Soul stage, and the master of the Upper Purity Palace, who has always stood with Shao Hua Mountain, hasn't made much progress either. With your strength, you don't need to worry about those people."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that this senior sister was indeed unfathomable. He stood up and paced back and forth, thinking for a moment before deciding to go. "Thank you, Senior Sister! I'll accompany you to Cangheng Island!"</p><p>With Senior Sister Qingjun shielding him from Elder Dongyang, how could he hesitate when it came to his Nascent Soul breakthrough? At worst, he could hide and avoid showing his face until he reached the Nascent Soul stage. The pills needed to assist his breakthrough had already been prepared by Wandering Cloud, and he had purchased most of the other required spiritual materials. From the tone of Qingjun's words, the Sin Abyss was about to make a comeback, and chaos was imminent. He needed to break through as soon as possible.</p><p>"The alliance meeting is in one month. Be prepared," Qingjun said with a nod.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang, concerned about the current situation, asked Qingjun for more details.</p><p>Qingjun thought for a moment and said, "It's hard to say what the Sin Abyss is planning. As for the Cold Domain, I haven't been in either domain for years, but after returning, I heard about a major event: the Pure Yang Sect has recently split."</p><p>"The Pure Yang Sect split?" Qin Sang was surprised. He had heard that the Pure Yang Sect was unstable, but he hadn't expected it to split so quickly. Over the past few years, he had been focused on cultivation and studying the sword scriptures, paying little attention to outside matters, so he hadn't heard any news.</p>
