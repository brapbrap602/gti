<h1>Chapter 2243: Imitation</h1><p>Having experienced the benefits of the Water-Fire Harmony chapter, Qin Sang and Tong Shen Shang Ren have been searching for other chapters of the *Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun*.</p><p>After Jin Ying was killed by Qin Sang, the items obtained from its cave fell into the hands of Tong Shen Shang Ren. He painstakingly followed some ambiguous clues, but all investigations led nowhere.</p><p>The clues ended there, but Qin Sang now sees a glimmer of hope and naturally doesn't want to miss it.</p><p>"Senior Brother, you were too impulsive this time," Qin Sang said frankly to Qing Yan.</p><p>Tong Shen Shang Ren had a reason for letting his second disciple, Qing Hong, take over the sect.</p><p>Qing Yan hung his head, ashamed. "From now on, I will listen to my junior brother. I will do whatever my junior brother tells me to do!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "From now on, when Master is away, all sect matters will be decided by Senior Sister Qing Hong."</p><p>"How can that be? It should be the junior brother..."</p><p>Qing Hong repeatedly refused.</p><p>The cultivation world respects strength; the capable take the lead.</p><p>"Precisely because I have high aptitude, I cannot waste time on mundane affairs. Master must have thought the same!  From now on, Junior Sister Shuang will assist Senior Sister, and Senior Brother and I will be Senior Sister's strong backing."</p><p>With a single sentence, Qin Sang determined the future structure of the sect. This act was equivalent to acting on behalf of Tong Shen Shang Ren, but Qing Yan and the others didn't think he was overstepping his bounds.  Moreover, they believed Tong Shen Shang Ren would agree.</p><p>Having easily arranged sect affairs, Qin Sang seemed to put the recent turmoil behind him and returned to his fire chamber.</p><p>For a Yuan Ying cultivator, this fire chamber was somewhat shabby.</p><p>Qin Sang was well-prepared. He re-inscribed runes, set up formations, and renovated the fire chamber, quickly making it brand new.</p><p>Inside the fire chamber,</p><p>The earth fire, after being refined through layers of restrictions, became extremely pure.</p><p>Qin Sang took out various spiritual materials, activated his Nascent Soul fire, and combined it with the earth fire to refine them one by one.</p><p>Normally, given Qin Sang's skill in refining, refining this level of material should be very easy. But during the refining process, Qin Sang would occasionally stop, frown in thought, and even occasionally ruin the materials, forcing him to start over.</p><p>Fortunately, he had prepared enough materials and didn't fear wastage.</p><p>After spending several times the usual amount of time, Qin Sang finally refined the last spiritual material. He let out a sigh of relief, looked at the clumps of spiritual essence in front of him, and fell into thought again.</p><p>Spiritual light constantly flickered in his eyes. He then drew upon a spiritual essence, throwing it into the fire; he repeated this several times, his movements intermittent, refining and deducing simultaneously.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, only the intense flames remained in front of Qin Sang, and within the flames, a mass resembling magma.</p><p>The 'magma' was divided into two parts, and the two clumps of 'magma' then exhibited completely different properties.</p><p>The flames on the surface of one 'magma' began to change, transforming from reddish-orange to light blue, like a mass of cold flames, and the 'magma' cooled down, losing its original luster.  The other clump of 'magma' became increasingly hotter, forming a striking contrast.</p><p>Then, both clumps of 'magma' began to contract inward, absorbing the surface flames into their interiors.</p><p>Gradually, the 'magma' became smaller and smaller, until they were the size of chess pieces, finally turning into two chess pieces, orbiting each other and slowly floating towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang reached out and caught the two chess pieces, one warm and one icy cold.</p><p>These were the life-bound magic treasures he had refined for himself in the illusionary realm. He did not choose his most familiar sword, but based on his understanding of water, fire, and Yin-Yang Dao, he imitated the black and white chess pieces and refined these two pieces.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dao foundation was the Water-Fire Harmony chapter, so it differed greatly from the black and white chess pieces. The two chess pieces were not black and white, but one blue and one red.</p><p>The blue chess piece was like a piece of ice, and the red chess piece had flames burning on its surface.</p><p>"Let's call you Water-Fire Chess Pieces,"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>These two chess pieces were the crystallization of his summary of the Water-Fire Harmony Dao, and they could also help him continue to comprehend this Dao, and even later, the black and white chess pieces.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Dao is vast and profound. Once he returned to the real world, Qin Sang would find it hard to spare time to cultivate this Dao concurrently, so he took advantage of this illusory realm to lay the foundation for the future.</p><p>"A pity... hmm, not bad..."</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the power of the Water-Fire Chess Pieces, giving two completely different evaluations.</p><p>It was a pity that the Water-Fire Chess Pieces only imitated a small part of the spirit of the black and white chess pieces.</p><p>However, the power of the Water-Fire Chess Pieces was satisfactory. If he had refined the Water-Fire Chess Pieces before returning to the sect, Qin Sang wouldn't need any underhanded tactics to defeat that Tian Jing Gate expert.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the chess pieces and left the training chamber, arriving at the main hall.</p><p>Qing Hong, having learned of his emergence from seclusion, rushed over, along with an elderly Mr. Zhou and others who had arrived in response to a message.</p><p>“Mr. Zhou,”</p><p>Qin Sang greeted respectfully.</p><p>The elderly Mr. Zhou sized Qin Sang up, repeatedly exclaiming, “Truly remarkable! Qing Feng, you are now my peer; let us address each other as fellow cultivators.”</p><p>“Mr. Zhou and Master are close friends; I dare not presume,” Qin Sang humbly replied.</p><p>At this moment, Qing Hong handed him a jade slip containing information about the Heaven’s Purity Sect.</p><p>Based on these records, the Heaven’s Purity Sect showed no intention of expanding into the Qingtuo River area. Why they interfered, framing the Source Purity Mountain, remained a mystery.</p><p>“Were there any unusual activities from the Qingjiang Sect during my seclusion?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Qing Hong said, “The Qingjiang Sect has drastically reduced its presence, completely withdrawing to the upper reaches. Yu Chen and the sect elders are all holed up in the mountain, plotting something.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and said to Mr. Zhou, “I intend to go down the mountain now.  I would be grateful if you could oversee the sect.”</p><p>“Certainly, I have no pressing matters; it makes no difference where I cultivate,” Mr. Zhou readily agreed.</p><p>“Junior Brother, be extremely careful on your descent; don't be reckless. Remember, your safety is paramount to the sect. As long as you are alive, even if the sect falls and we all perish, there will still be a day when we can rebuild it.”</p><p>Qing Hong saw Qin Sang off at the mountain gate, speaking in a low voice.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a change in his senior sister’s demeanor. This admonition lacked her usual playful nature. Of course, Qing Hong's concern remained undiminished; it had simply become more reserved, reflecting her growing authority as sect leader.</p><p>“Senior Brother needs to recover, and Junior Sister Shuang is in seclusion; I didn’t wake them. Is there anything you want me to convey to them?” Qing Hong asked.</p><p>“I’ll tell them upon my return.”</p><p>Qin Sang left these four words and soared into the sky.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang leave, Qing Hong turned back to the mountain gate.  She saw Shuang Luo standing alone at the cliff edge, gazing beyond the mountains, her eyes filled with worry.</p><p>“What a menace!”</p><p>Qing Hong gritted her teeth, sighing softly, and asked, “Junior Sister, since you’ve emerged from seclusion, why didn't you see your Junior Brother off?”</p><p>Shuang Luo bit her lip and shook her head slightly.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the Source Purity Mountain incident, the Qingjiang Sect was the most powerful sect in the Qingtuo River region.</p><p>The Qingjiang Sect's mountain gate was built on the banks of the Qingtuo River. Its protective formation created a water mist, covering a section of the river and dozens of nearby mountain ranges, making it appear extremely mysterious from the outside.</p><p>Times had changed. The atmosphere around the Qingjiang Sect was tense and heavily guarded.</p><p>However, no matter how tight the security or how sophisticated the surveillance, no one noticed an uninvited guest who had been lingering outside the mountain gate for several days.</p><p>“It seems Chen hasn’t arrived at the Qingjiang Sect yet. He shouldn’t leave for a while…”</p><p>By the riverbank, Qin Sang sat cross-legged under a tree, gazing at the distant Qingjiang Sect, lost in thought.</p><p>He could easily infiltrate the Qingjiang Sect but chose not to.  Attacking the Qingjiang Sect prematurely would reveal his intentions and hinder his subsequent actions.</p><p>Combining information from Source Purity Mountain and various clues, Qin Sang had pinpointed the whereabouts of Chen Yu Ze and others.</p><p>After a long look at the Qingjiang Sect, Qin Sang quietly withdrew, found a secluded spot, set up an array, gathered starlight, and continued to cultivate the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique.</p><p>While cultivating, Qin Sang constantly monitored the sky, but the calling remained absent.</p><p>“Did that voice just disappear?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised; he still hadn't figured out the origin of the voice.</p><p>Recalling the circumstances when the voice stopped, its owner might have encountered an accident, such as an attack by a powerful enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang was unsure whether this was good or bad, so he could only focus on cultivating the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, taking things one step at a time.</p><p>The good news was that, although the calling had ceased, his cultivation speed wasn't affected.  From then on, Qin Sang’s cultivation progressed at an astonishing rate.</p><p>Early third level, mid third level…</p><p>In just over a month, Qin Sang reached the late third level, a dreamlike advancement that would make others envious.</p><p>He didn't stop, continuing his cultivation until he reached the peak of the third level, only a step away from breaking through and comprehending the Heavenly Demon Dharma Form.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this step should have been effortless, yet he suddenly stopped and looked up at the night sky.</p><p>The voice had yet to reappear.</p><p>The stars twinkled, and the night sky was silent.</p><p>Perhaps it was psychological, but Qin Sang felt a vaguely unsettling atmosphere pervading the starry expanse.</p><p>Regardless, he had to take this step. Qin Sang dismissed his distractions and condensed the Dharma Form shadow.</p><p>This, incidentally, was another major difference between the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* and other demonic cultivation techniques.</p><p>Among the techniques Qin Sang had encountered, none allowed the cultivator to approach Dharma Form at the initial stage of transformation.</p><p>Even as a mere illusory form, beyond my master's control, news of it would surely astonish other demon cultivators.</p><p>The breakthrough was uneventful.  Qin Sang reached the fourth level of *Tian Yao Lian Xing* and re-cultivated the illusory form, far more substantial than before.  Moreover, this illusory form possessed a certain grace and vitality absent in the past.  The Azure Bird's eyes shimmered with an unusual light, as if ready to take flight at any moment.</p><p>“That voice hasn't appeared yet.  Something unexpected must have happened…”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the tranquil night sky, a thought crossing his mind.</p><p>But he dared not be careless. The changes in the Azure Bird's illusory form made him even more wary.</p><p>It was his own creation, yet when Qin Sang focused on the illusory form's eyes during meditation, he felt as if someone were looking back at him.</p><p>Within the Azure Bird's illusory form, it felt like another Azure Bird, another consciousness, resided!</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, considering various possibilities, such as some entity parasitizing the illusory form.</p><p>Could this entity usurp the form and resurrect itself?</p><p>The Azure Bird's illusory form was Qin Sang's own conception; the Azure Bird's residual soul had long since vanished. Yet, upon deeper reflection, the creation of the illusory form wasn't solely his own doing; it relied on an external force.</p><p>Stellar energy!</p><p>Starlight!</p><p>The strange illusory form, the unnatural speed of cultivation…</p><p>Could something be subtly infiltrating his body through the starlight, unbeknownst to him?</p><p>The thought was terrifying!</p><p>Qin Sang frowned deeply, activating his spiritual sense to repeatedly scan his body and the illusory form. Aside from this, everything seemed normal.</p><p>This is just an illusory form.  With continued cultivation, Qin Sang should condense a true form sooner than before. At this rate, it might take less than a year.</p><p>Currently, the illusory form has little effect on his physical body, but at the moment of the Azure Bird's form's birth, an unexpected event could occur – a reversal of roles?</p><p>The mere thought made Qin Sang's scalp tingle. If caught unprepared, regret would be his only companion.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang even wished for the call to return sooner, hoping for direct communication.  The unknown was the most frightening. Only by knowing the other party's intentions could he prepare.</p><p>For now, there was only one word—wait!</p><p>Wait for the call to return, or for his return to the Divine Transformation stage, before considering further advancements in *Tian Yao Lian Xing*.</p><p>His current strength was enough to handle most situations.</p><p>Dismanteling the formation, Qin Sang returned to the Qingjiang Sect, wandered near the mountain gate for a while, then departed.</p><p>…</p><p>“Qi Bo, the Qingjiang Sect leader keeps making excuses.  Is he planning to betray us?”</p><p>Chen Yuze, Qi Bo, and two maidservants were aboard a bamboo-leaf shaped flying artifact, drifting slowly through the air.</p><p>Each time Chen Yuze thought of Qin Sang, those two beauties, and his own humiliating encounter before them, his hatred grew stronger.  They had been staying at the Qingjiang Sect, but the sect leader kept evading their requests, infuriating Chen Yuze.</p><p>Qi Bo said, “The die is cast. The Qingjiang Sect and Yuanjing Mountain are already sworn enemies. It's not something he can resolve easily.  Furthermore, betraying us now would only incur further wrath.  He's not that foolish. However, he certainly lacks decisiveness; otherwise, he wouldn't have let Yuanjing Mountain grow so powerful, conceding half of the Qingtuo River. We'll probably need the master to make a personal promise for him to feel secure.”</p><p>“I don't know how father will punish me when I return.”</p><p>Chen Yuze tapped his forehead with a folding fan, feeling a deep headache coming on.</p><p>“It’s all my fault…”</p><p>Qi Bo suddenly stiffened, rising abruptly, his gaze sweeping across the surroundings before his face turned pale.</p><p>“Which cultivator dares to set up a formation here, blocking our path! The Tianjing Sect is just ahead; your audacity is astounding!”</p><p>Qi Bo stopped the bamboo-leaf artifact and shouted.</p><p>The roar, like thunder, shook the heavens, yet did not travel far.</p><p>The surrounding mountain peaks began to move, each one like a chess piece on a vast board of earth, forming an immensely grand formation.</p><p>Chen Yuze and the two maidservants only then realized they had fallen into a large array!</p>
