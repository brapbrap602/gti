<h1>Chapter 906: Dark Clouds</h1><p>The passage, having lost its source of black smoke, began to rapidly shrink, unable to sustain itself. Once it fully closed, those trapped inside would have no escape. Even if they didn't die within the spirit formation, they would certainly be captured by the Orchid Valley Sect.</p><p>Fang was faced with a difficult dilemma.</p><p>He was still unaware of the events that had transpired, unsure why that person had appeared to disrupt the flag formation, or what they had done.</p><p>With his fellow disciples trapped, and the possibility of the treasure being inside…</p><p>After all, his second junior brother's strength and intelligence were undeniable. With him personally leading the treasure retrieval, it shouldn't have been so easy for something to go wrong.</p><p>Fang finally cursed, flashing to the passage entrance. Beside him, the Blood Jiao roared, fearlessly rushing into the shrinking passage, only its tail remaining visible.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>A Bewitchment Clan cultivator was thrown out, still disoriented. Fang immediately grabbed him by the collar.</p><p>"Where's the stone platform?"</p><p>"Senior Brother!"</p><p>The cultivator, overjoyed at his survival, then turned pale with fear.  "Second Senior Brother was ambushed… he's dead… His belongings were… were stolen…"</p><p>Before he could finish, Fang, enraged, slapped him across the face, sending him flying dozens of meters.</p><p>"Useless!"</p><p>Fang trembled with fury.</p><p>He had risked everything, only to come up empty-handed.  His second junior brother, with so many men and the Beast King Banner, had been killed and robbed right under their noses. How could Fang not be furious?</p><p>Just then, the Blood Jiao managed to rescue another person. As the passage continued to shrink, the Blood Jiao, unable to hold it open any longer, was forced to retreat.</p><p>Three figures floated forlornly on the empty sea.</p><p>With the passage closed, those trapped inside were beyond saving.</p><p>Now, only the three of them and the two Blood Corpse Insects remained. Most importantly, the stone platform was gone, snatched away by someone else. Their master's mission had failed.</p><p>The three exchanged glances, their expressions filled with despair.</p><p>"Pursue!"</p><p>"We will not rest until this person is dead!"</p><p>Fang's eyes were bloodshot, nearly losing his reason.  He didn't care if he could catch up or not. He mounted the Blood Jiao and charged in the direction Qin Sang had vanished.</p><p>His two remaining disciples exchanged a look, not daring to speak.  Noticing Elder Lu approaching, they were startled and quickly grabbed the Blood Jiao's tail.</p><p>Meanwhile…</p><p>On Clarity Island, cultivators from various sects had broken through the flag formation. Some followed the fleeing Black Serpent Mountain disciples into the passage, while others surrounded those left behind.</p><p>The stranded Black Serpent Mountain disciples, wielding the Beast King Banner, offered feeble resistance, despair etched on their faces.  However, the other sects aimed to capture them alive, surrounding but not killing.</p><p>The scene was utter chaos.</p><p>Just then, a streak of black and white light arrived – Elder Huayang.</p><p>Trapped by the Blood Jiao until now, Elder Huayang's robes were tattered, his body stained with blood, his breath ragged, and his expression frantic.</p><p>Upon reaching the Dark Thunder Wood, a sense of foreboding washed over Elder Huayang.  Seeing the exposed stone steps and sensing a surge of violent energy emanating from within, he paled, rushing over and shouting, "The Thunder Essence is about to erupt! Run!"</p><p>Everyone paused, looking at Elder Huayang as if he were a jester.</p><p>"What Thunder Essence? Elder Huayang, your Orchid Valley Sect has hidden this well. Clarity Island holds secret treasures, yet we knew nothing. If you hadn't been hoarding it all for yourselves, things wouldn't have come to this…"</p><p>Having failed to secure any treasure, some expressed their dissatisfaction, questioning Elder Huayang.</p><p>But Elder Huayang ignored them, dropping that single sentence before fleeing, as if something terrifying lurked within the woods.  His expression didn't seem feigned.</p><p>Alarmed, the others extended their divine senses, finally detecting the anomaly.</p><p>"This energy is so violent… Could there really be Thunder Essence underground?"</p><p>"Run!"</p><p>…</p><p>Everyone scrambled to escape.</p><p>Just as they fled, a sun-like light erupted from the Dark Thunder Wood, exploding before their horrified eyes.</p><p>The Dark Thunder Wood vanished, leaving a deep crater in its place.  Terrifying waves of energy swept across everything.</p><p>The cultivators who managed to escape were still struck by the residual force, now looking much like Elder Huayang – clothes in tatters, eyes vacant, faces filled with fear.</p><p>Clarity Island trembled violently, monstrous waves surging.</p><p>Elder Lu, though outside the island, felt the impact, groaning and staggering. He looked towards Clarity Island, his expression drastically changing.</p><p>Qin Sang, having escaped quite a distance, was also startled by the explosion.  Turning back, he saw a dark cloud rising from Clarity Island, seemingly laced with arcs of lightning, a stark contrast against the clear blue sky and sea. It lingered for a long time.</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, bewildered.</p><p>Back at the Dark Thunder Wood, fearing further danger within the stone steps and potential exposure if his Skyeye Butterfly entered, he had decided against it.  As long as he knew who took the treasure, he could simply kill them and take it by force, no need for unnecessary risks.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang was unaware of Clarity Island's Thunder Pool.</p><p>"What did those guys do?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, truly shocked by the sight.</p><p>"Not only did they steal the treasure, but they also ruined this blessed land of Clarity Island. Even though I wasn't responsible, the Orchid Valley Sect will surely blame me. Offending both the Bewitchment Clan and the Human Clan, with three Nascent Soul ancestors… Thankfully, I was cautious, not using my Two-Headed Green Python in public. Only the Star Conch and the divided sword light were exposed…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was conflicted.</p><p>He was still unaware of the other Nascent Soul ancestor's death from the Orchid Valley Sect.</p><p>However, two Nascent Soul enemies, with both the Bewitchment Clan and Human Clan hunting him, were more than enough trouble.</p><p>"The Black Serpent Mountain people massacred the Fighting Bull Peak's abandoned disciples, so the Fighting Bull Peak's true inheritance must have fallen into their hands. The first person I killed seemed to be of high rank, second only to Fang. His storage bag should have it. Hopefully, this inheritance is useful. If it can solve the Star Essence Infusion, I'll find a place to seclude myself for decades, cultivating until the Seven Kill Hall opens. Let's see where you'll find me then…"</p><p>Qin Sang's resolve hardened.</p><p>He still had an important task.  With no time to examine the storage bags, he glanced back. Having shaken off his pursuers, he concealed his aura, took a large detour, and stealthily returned to retrieve his avatar.</p><p>Soon after, the Green蚨 Cash in Qin Sang's hand stirred.</p><p>Before parting ways, Qin Sang had given his avatar another coin, instructing him to crush it after escaping so he could be found.</p><p>Arriving at the deserted island and sensing his avatar's location, Qin Sang relaxed. His avatar had successfully escaped.  Amidst the chaos on Clarity Island, no one had noticed the movements of a Qi Refinement disciple.</p><p>He flicked his finger, revealing a black coffin artifact, and instructed his avatar to enter. Then, carrying the coffin on his back, he fled this place of turmoil.</p><p>As for the repercussions of this chaos, that was no longer his concern.</p>
