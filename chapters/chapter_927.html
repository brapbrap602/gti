<h1>Chapter 919: Corpse Refining Technique</h1><p>The swamp was permeated with Yin Qi.</p><p>Countless lives must have been swallowed by the swamp to cultivate such a vast area of extreme Yin.</p><p>The outer edges of the swamp had weaker Yin Qi, but the spiritual energy was richer than other places. However, unless they cultivated ghost techniques using Yin Qi, ordinary cultivators wouldn't establish their caves here.</p><p>Deep within the swamp, thick Yin Qi coalesced, devouring all vitality, with almost no living creatures in sight, similar to the Yin Sha Abyss of the Kui Yin Sect.</p><p>In such a place, there was a stone tower, half-submerged in the swamp, half-floating above.</p><p>At this moment, three figures hovered before the stone tower.</p><p>A large pit appeared in the swamp below, with surrounding black mud closing in towards the center. The bottom sludge churned up, black and yellow, emitting a putrid odor.</p><p>This indescribable scene was enough to make anyone nauseous.</p><p>Standing in front of the stone tower was a square-faced cultivator. His face was ashen, his left hand tucked into his sleeve, trembling incessantly. He was forcibly suppressing it with true essence, making it invisible from the outside.</p><p>"Impressive skills!"</p><p>The square-faced cultivator clenched his fist, his face filled with anger, gritting his teeth, "Fine! Luo concedes. The Corpse Refining Technique is yours!"</p><p>With that, he flicked his sleeve, and a streak of light flew towards the opposite side, containing a jade slip.</p><p>The two figures opposite stood one behind the other, both wearing ghost-faced masks. Although not magical treasures, they were top-tier magical artifacts.  The black-robed cultivator, a Foundation Establishment expert, couldn't penetrate the masks with his divine sense to see their true faces.</p><p>"Many thanks, fellow Daoist."</p><p>The figure in front grabbed the jade slip, scanned it with his divine sense, and a hint of joy appeared in his voice.  He tossed back another jade slip. "We apologize for the offense today.  We hope Fellow Daoist Luo won't take it to heart.  As promised, we won't divulge your Corpse Refining Technique. In exchange, here is a corpse technique I collected previously, which should be helpful to you. Farewell!"</p><p>Before the words faded, the two figures activated their escape lights and flew away without looking back.</p><p>A moment later, several cultivators flew out of the stone tower, landing behind the square-faced cultivator. Their faces were filled with resentment, sharing a common hatred. "Master, are we just letting them go?"</p><p>The square-faced cultivator's face was gloomy. "If we don't let them go, should we keep them here? Didn't you see?  That person, with only his swordsmanship, was my equal in our earlier exchange. The aura of the person behind him seemed even stronger, likely a late Foundation Establishment expert."</p><p>"Late Foundation Establishment!"</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Another person spoke up, "But Master, you haven't fully activated the formation. Even a late Foundation Establishment expert shouldn't be able to easily break through your Nether Corpse Formation, right?  Moreover, your main Nether Corpse is comparable to a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  As long as we hold on for a while, Senior Mao will arrive with reinforcements…"</p><p>Hearing this, the square-faced cultivator's face darkened even more. He snorted coldly, "Look at where that person was standing. It was the weakest point of the formation. This is no coincidence!  The Nether Corpse Formation is my original creation. No one else should know how to break it.  That means this person is extremely proficient in formations and easily saw through its flaws…"</p><p>Hearing this, the disciples were even more astonished, realizing how dangerous the situation had been.</p><p>"Forget it! This person wasn't after my Nether Corpse Sect's core inheritance. Without the core techniques, many secret arts are unusable. The remaining parts are similar to other corpse refining techniques of other sects. It doesn't matter if I give it to him.  Besides, the corpse refining technique he gave me seems rather unique. Once I comprehend it, I might be able to improve the Nether Corpse Formation…"</p><p>The square-faced cultivator gradually calmed down and returned to the stone tower.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, the two figures had flown out of the swamp. They were Qin Sang and his avatar.</p><p>For over a decade, Bai Zhongqiu and his wife had followed Qin Sang's orders, making discreet inquiries about renowned corpse cultivators in the Split Wind Islands.</p><p>Qin Sang selected those he could provoke and visited them one by one, exchanging ideas about corpse refining techniques and corpse cultivation.</p><p>The jade slip Qin Sang gave contained not the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*, but another corpse cultivation inheritance he obtained in the Small Cold Region, also incomplete.</p><p>The Small Cold Region wasn't lacking in such incomplete techniques, mostly ancient cultivator inheritances excavated from ancient battlefields.  They still held value, allowing fellow corpse cultivators to gain insights.</p><p>Therefore, with such secret arts for exchange, coupled with his and his avatar's displayed strength, the exchange process went quite smoothly.</p><p>Qin Sang's purpose was twofold: to find a way to unlock the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and to gain inspiration from other corpse refining techniques, hoping to deduce the subsequent parts of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*.</p><p>In fact, while working for the merchant association in the Demon Sea, Qin Sang had been collecting such techniques, using spirit stones back then. In the Split Wind Islands, he relied more on force.</p><p>Cultivators who could establish themselves in the Split Wind Islands all possessed some skill.  Several of the corpse refining techniques Qin Sang obtained did have unique aspects.</p><p>Unfortunately, none followed a similar path as the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*.</p><p>Among these techniques, there were some that could refine flying Yakshas, but all required lengthy corpse nurturing and refining processes, along with various demanding conditions, no less difficult than a normal cultivator reaching Foundation Establishment.</p><p>His avatar already consumed enough resources and energy. He couldn't afford to be distracted by nurturing corpses.</p><p>Over the past decade, Qin Sang spared no effort in improving his avatar, finally breaking through to late Foundation Establishment not long ago. From Foundation Establishment to late stage in less than thirty years – other cultivators would weep with envy upon hearing this.</p><p>But for Qin Sang, it was still too slow.</p><p>From the information he gathered, the Seven Kills Palace would likely open in seven or eight years, not enough time for his avatar to reach peak Foundation Establishment.  He had to use accelerated methods.</p><p>The good news was that the cultivation of the *Demonic Physique Refinement* had been progressing smoothly, reaching the mid-third stage ten years ago, on par with his cultivation level.</p><p>Although the subsequent progress slowed significantly, Qin Sang wasn't afraid of stellar煞 energy, so his cultivation speed was still much faster than others.</p><p>He was even considering whether to consume the Tyrant Blood Fruit before the Seven Kills Palace opened and attempt to break through to the late-third stage.</p><p>"Nether Corpse…"</p><p>Qin Sang landed in a safe place, instructing his avatar to stand guard while he focused on examining the newly acquired corpse refining technique.</p><p>"The Nether Corpse Sect's technique is indeed different, but it requires cultivating a unique Nether Yin Qi before refining.  No wonder that person handed it over so readily!"</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense with a light sigh.</p><p>Apart from the Nether Yin Qi, this technique wasn't much different from other corpse refining techniques and offered little help in unlocking the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>"There are still a few people I haven't contacted, but there's no time.  The auction on Wind Concealment Island is about to begin. I must obtain the jade pendant to enter the Seven Kills Palace.  It seems I'll have to use those precious spirit items obtained from that person in Black Serpent Mountain…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and then flew westward.</p>
