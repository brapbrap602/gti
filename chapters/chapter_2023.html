<h1>Chapter 2014: Turning the Tide</h1><p>Gu Ya’s thoughts coincided with Qin Sang’s. He too hoped to encounter ascended seniors from the Storm World at Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>Ascended cultivators from the Storm World were always exceptional talents.  Besides Tian Yue, Qin Sang knew Xiaoxiangzi and Baogu were outstanding figures.</p><p>The Four Saints, leading the weak human race, overthrew the original rulers of the Canglang Sea, the Witch Clan, ushering in an era of prosperity for the human race in the Canglang Sea. Their accomplishments are still remembered. Baogu dedicated her life to the human race, leaving guidance for future generations before embarking on her ascension.</p><p>Xiaoxiangzi suppressed an ancient demon; the Xuan Tian Palace was built because of him. He also laid plans in the North Sea to prevent the ancient demon from breaking free, leaving behind items such as the Spirit-Subduing Incense.</p><p>To a certain extent, Qin Sang benefited from their legacy, hence his current standing.</p><p>Their talent and spirit were top-notch. If they could ascend to the Greater Thousand Worlds and enter a wider world, barring unforeseen accidents, they would surely achieve great things.</p><p>“With this in mind, I set off. I was very cautious along the way and encountered several dangerous situations. Fortunately, I was alert and managed to escape unscathed.</p><p>“This time, I was hired. My employer claimed that Fengju Jade Gate was a place of great upheaval and sought opportunities there, but lacked manpower and hired experts as bodyguards.  Thinking that being in a group was safer than traveling alone, I took the job.</p><p>“The journey was smooth. However, just before reaching Fengju Jade Gate, we were pursued. That’s when we learned that our employer had concealed the truth; the treasure hunt was just a cover, unfortunately discovered by their enemies, who then pursued us.</p><p>“This sort of thing is not uncommon. The enemies usually target the employer; we bodyguards, as long as we are not entangled, can retreat decisively without being pursued to the death. However, they targeted my Jade Heart Blade. Luckily, I met you, senior…”</p><p>Gu Ya glared at the two bodies on the ground. Earlier, Qin Sang had told her not to call him a saint, so she addressed him as senior.</p><p>It turned out her judgment was correct. Not only did she encounter an ascended senior from the lower realms at Fengju Jade Gate, but it was Qin the Saint, revered by an entire world.</p><p>Qin the Saint lived up to his reputation. He not only escaped the clutches of the demons but had already broken through to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The Storm World is saved!</p><p>This thought, the joy of encountering Qin Sang, immediately overshadowed the unpleasantness of being pursued.  Gu Ya’s eyes shone brightly.</p><p>“Senior, when are we going home?”</p><p>She believed that since Qin the Saint could sacrifice himself to lead the demons away for the sake of his world’s people, he must care deeply about the lower realms.</p><p>Finally, I can go home!</p><p>“You’re in a hurry to go back? Why not wait for the Jade Heart Blade to fully transform before leaving? That way, you’ll be much safer.”</p><p>Qin Sang saw that the Jade Heart Blade was nearing transformation.</p><p>Perhaps the Xu Ling Sect or Gu Ya had other opportunities; otherwise, according to their previous arrangements, the Jade Heart Blade would only be tempered in the Mountain Within the Mountain, and it wouldn't have advanced so quickly.</p><p>If Gu Ya had more patience and gathered more spiritual materials to refine the Jade Heart Blade into a spiritual treasure, her strength would increase significantly.</p><p>“What? Is the situation in the Storm World bad?”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the change in Gu Ya’s expression and narrowed his eyes, already having some guesses.</p><p>Gu Ya nodded, her expression grave but resolute.  “The Storm World and the Changyou Clan have been at odds for many years, with countless fellow cultivators and seniors falling on the battlefield. Even for my own sake, I must return. Before I was swept away by the Mist Waterfall, I had not yet broken through to the Divine Transformation stage. This time, I can definitely play a bigger role, kill more enemies! My master died at the hands of the Changyou Clan, and I brought the Jade Heart Blade, a legacy of my sect, with me. My sect has suffered heavy losses and is leaderless; I don't know what's become of them…”</p><p>After Bing Han’s death, Gu Ya took over as sect leader. As the leader of a sect, how could she not worry about her sect? Gu Ya longed to have wings and fly back to the Mist Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang was her only hope.</p><p>“How strong is the Changyou Clan? Besides them, are there any other enemies?” Qin Sang asked further.</p><p>Everything Gu Ya said was within Qin Sang’s expectations.</p><p>Before ascending to the Greater Thousand Worlds, the top fighting force in the Storm World was only at the late Nascent Soul stage. Even after passing the Gray Sky Tribulation, their strength would rise rapidly in a short time, but there were limits.</p><p>The Storm World’s starting point was too low. Moreover, the Storm World cultivators didn't understand the severity of the Gray Sky Tribulation; they were unprepared at the beginning and many experts would certainly perish.</p><p>In some accounts, the overall strength of the Yi people was not as good as the human race. Yet, they could stand in a corner of the Greater Thousand Worlds, a named and famed great race. The Storm World falling into the territory of the Yi people, even if the Storm World's human, witch, and demon clans united, they would not have the strength to contend with the Yi people, there would be no war.</p><p>The Otherkin, similar to the Youkai, are a collective term for many groups.  These groups share a common trait: a human-like appearance.  It's said their customs are also similar to humans, but they differ significantly from humans in certain physical characteristics, instead resembling Youkai.</p><p>These characteristics might be facial features, or anywhere on the body. For example, the Changyou people are born with fur and four ears; the Feather People are all strikingly beautiful, born with swan-like white wings, allowing even ordinary members to soar through the sky like birds.</p><p>Some Otherkin, in addition to distinct features, possess innate magical abilities, like the Youkai.</p><p>It might seem that Otherkin are a fusion of human and Youkai bloodlines, but according to ancient texts, this isn't the case.  The offspring of human-Youkai unions are called Half-Youkai in the vast world, while those categorized as Otherkin are simply called "Otherkin".</p><p>Records indicate that the Jao and Feather People are the dominant groups among the Otherkin; one patrolling the skies, the other guarding the oceans.</p><p>The Otherkin mostly inhabit the Mist Sea, a region containing countless tribes and nations. Humans know little about it, and texts offer scant details.</p><p>The Mist Sea’s environment is unique, but it cannot offer eternal protection. The Otherkin's survival in this harsh world speaks to their considerable strength.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't know if the Jao and Feather People have any Mahayana cultivators, but there are certainly many Nascent Soul cultivators among them.</p><p>If the Otherkin targeted the Storm Realm, they could easily obliterate it—unless the enemy consisted only of one or two small Otherkin tribes.</p><p>"The Changyou alone inflicted heavy losses.  And besides the natural disaster, the Mist Waterfall, there are also the unpredictable Mist Beasts in the Mist Sea. To gather strength against the Changyou, we were forced to abandon the Youkai Sea and Canglang Sea, relocating the three tribes there to the Central Continent.  Even though we tried to move the commoners before the Changyou reacted, we still suffered tremendous losses," Gu Ya sighed.</p><p>The four saints, after countless hardships, had fought for a haven for future generations, yet they failed to protect it.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind flashed to Tianxing Island and the Four Saints Mountain, then to the Witch God Continent. Ya Gu's homeland had also fallen to the Otherkin.</p><p>The Central and Western Continents are part of the same landmass. The distance between them was unknown, previously uninhabitable due to storms ripping apart the earth and rampant lava flows.</p><p>Now that the storms have subsided, if the land recovers, it will be a vast, empty expanse, more than sufficient to relocate all the Storm Realm's inhabitants.</p><p>"What about the Four Regions of the North Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked gravely, fearing their fall as well.</p><p>Da Sui, Xiao Han Domain, Shao Hua Mountain, Qianshan Bamboo Sea, Beichen Realm, Xuan Yue Realm, Yin Ri Realm…</p><p>So many places holding precious memories.</p><p>"After the storms between the Central and Western Continents dissipated, the land calmed, and we unexpectedly discovered an ancient Grand Teleportation Array leading to the North Sea. With this array, the Central Continent can provide timely support if the enemy attacks. Otherwise, we would have had to consider abandoning our homeland," Gu Ya said gratefully. "Fairy Liuli, uniting various forces, led the Storm Realm cultivators.  Using the former Western and Central Continents, and the North Sea, they formed a three-pronged defense against the Changyou…"</p><p>Hearing that the North Sea held, Qin Sang felt relieved. The places he had traveled, the marks he left behind, weren’t completely erased.</p><p>The Changyou likely aren't very strong, with their strongest probably only at the Transformation stage, but they're a dangerous foe for the fledgling Storm Realm.</p><p>From Gu Ya's tone, it's clear Fairy Liuli played a crucial role in the war between the Storm Realm and the Changyou.</p><p>Upon hearing "Fairy Liuli," Qin Sang had suppressed his curiosity. Now, he finally asked.</p><p>"Fairy Liuli is said to be the first Transformation stage cultivator, perhaps even the only one, when the Storm Realm joined the Great World. Thankfully, she stepped forward in this crisis, rallying various forces and uniting the people. That’s how different races and regions could work together to overcome the most difficult period…"</p><p>Gu Ya glanced at Qin Sang as she spoke.</p><p>It’s said Fairy Liuli was Qin Shengren's partner, with Xuan Tian Palace cultivators swearing they held a partner ceremony, witnessed by the entire sect.</p><p>Of course, the previous claim was that Fairy Liuli was Qin Shengren's widow.  Her influence is a major reason why different forces cooperated so smoothly under her leadership.</p><p>Even though Liuli Xianzi devoted herself wholeheartedly to Storm Realm, repeatedly risking her life, some still harbored ill intentions, wrongly speculating that her erecting a statue for Qin Shengren was motivated by selfish desires.  Only after witnessing the sacred mountain brought by the Canglang Sea Witch tribe, and the terrifying traces of the demon attack on the broken mountain, did these people finally fall silent.</p><p>Gu Ya clearly remembered encountering Liuli Xianzi on the day she went to the sacred site to pay respects to the statue. Liuli Xianzi stood silently before it for a long time. Gu Ya regretted not having the courage to speak to her.</p><p>From Liuli Xianzi, Gu Ya sensed a distant and aloof aura, whether it was her inherent nature or the sorrow caused by the death of her dao companion.</p><p>Gu Ya still vividly remembers that lonely figure, those frail shoulders bearing an unimaginable burden.</p><p>Therefore, Gu Ya leaned towards the latter explanation. Otherwise, Liuli Xianzi could have abandoned Storm Realm at any time, taking only her close ones with her.  Why would she risk her life, fighting desperately to secure a glimmer of hope for Storm Realm, if not to prevent Qin Xianren's efforts from being wasted?  The statue was also a place to commemorate her dao companion, and it was something he rightfully deserved.</p><p>What profound conjugal love! Gu Ya didn't envy Liuli Xianzi for having Qin Xianren as her dao companion, but she envied their genuine affection. Thankfully, heaven spared him; they were reunited.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, realizing that even Liuli believed him to be dead.</p><p>It was understandable.  Back then, the First Sword Attendant had forcibly intervened to prevent his teleportation, causing a massive disturbance.  Elder Fang and other Witch cultivators were nearby, witnessing everything firsthand.</p><p>Logically, he had no chance of survival under such an attack.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't expect Liuli to go to such lengths, especially during the period when Storm Realm's strength had yet to improve. Qin Sang could imagine how difficult and arduous every step must have been.</p><p>Seeing Gu Ya's fervent gaze, Qin Sang understood her eagerness for him to take her back immediately.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang also wanted to return to Storm Realm as soon as possible.</p><p>Besides the anticipation of reuniting with old friends, Qin Sang also had another matter on his mind: he'd been preparing to establish an altar to cultivate the Great Completion Killing Dao, but hadn't found a suitable location yet.</p><p>Wouldn't Storm Realm be the perfect place?</p><p>Unlike the human world ruled by Qingyang Temple, Storm Realm revered him as a saint.  He didn't need to do anything further; their reverence was genuine and offered him unparalleled advantages in cultivating the Great Completion Killing Dao.</p><p>His presence would certainly ease the crisis in Storm Realm.</p><p>The word "ease" rather than "resolve" was used because Qin Sang was unfamiliar with the situation in the Mist Sea and the attitude of other heterogenous races towards Storm Realm.</p><p>Since other heterogenous races hadn't destroyed Storm Realm, a perceived anomaly, perhaps they weren't inherently hostile, giving Storm Realm a chance to survive.</p><p>Even if they faced rejection, he could find another way out for Storm Realm.</p><p>"The Mist Sea is far away in the East Sea. It's not as simple as saying we can get there. Also, do you know Storm Realm's exact location in the Mist Sea?" Qin Sang asked Gu Ya.</p><p>Gu Ya was taken aback, then shook her head, regaining her composure.</p><p>She only knew some information about the vicinity of Storm Realm, not its precise location.</p><p>If Storm Realm was deep within the Mist Sea, they would have to traverse the territories of various heterogenous races to reach it, a journey fraught with difficulties. They needed a detailed plan, starting with finding out the location of the Changyou tribe.</p><p>What Qin Sang didn't say was that he faced an even more difficult choice, one that prevented his immediate departure.</p><p>This trip to Fengju Jade Gate involved fragments of the Earth-killing Sword and the *Purple Micro Sword Scripture*.  The First Sword Attendant and Tianyue Shangren had used the Purple Micro Palace as bait to create an opportunity for him to obtain the sword, and he couldn't just leave.</p><p>Fortunately, based on Gu Ya's description, before she was swept away by the mist waterfall, Storm Realm, relying on its position near the North Sea, Western Lands, and Central Plains, was no longer as vulnerable to the Changyou tribe's attacks.</p><p>And Storm Realm's strength would continue to grow. Unless something unforeseen happened, it should be able to defend itself.  A few hundred years have passed; a little more time won't hurt. If a catastrophic event destroyed Storm Realm in the meantime, Qin Sang's arrival would be futile.</p><p>The news from Gu Ya caught Qin Sang off guard; his plans needed adjustments.</p><p>He only hoped that Tianyue Shangren would arrive quickly, but if his identity was exposed and he returned directly, wouldn't that bring disaster to Storm Realm?  Qin Sang furrowed his brow, needing a proper plan.</p><p>As he pondered, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly flickered, and he turned his head towards the depths of the wind and sand.</p><p>Several auras were rapidly approaching, likely the companions of the two.</p>
