<h1>Chapter 1238: Blood Shadow Evil Spirits</h1><p>As Dongyang Bo followed Gongliang Yu inside, Qin Sang also arrived above the Blood River.</p><p>“That’s the Yuan Ying spirit puppet from Shangyuan Quiet Palace; its reputation is well-deserved.”</p><p>Even from a distance, Qin Sang felt threatened by the Yuan Ying spirit puppet.</p><p>The puppet itself was incredibly powerful, and its lack of pain and fearless nature meant that Dongyang Bo would likely struggle to subdue it quickly.</p><p>It was unexpected that Gongliang Yu could bring out the Yuan Ying spirit puppet, and even more surprising that he could control it alone, despite the massive difference in strength, without being affected.</p><p>This time, Dongyang Bo had miscalculated.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.  The stronger Gongliang Yu became, the better. A fierce battle with Dongyang Bo would force him to reveal all his tricks, allowing Qin Sang to assess his true strength.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was leaning towards saving Gongliang Yu.</p><p>Regardless of Shangyuan Quiet Palace, Gongliang Yu’s ability to control such a powerful puppet proved his worth and qualified him as an ally.</p><p>However, the timing of intervention needed careful consideration.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t know much about Gongliang Yu, especially his courage.</p><p>At the very least, it would be after Dongyang Bo revealed his true colors and they became enemies.</p><p>Ideally, it would be at the most critical moment, when Gongliang Yu was clearly losing, offering a timely rescue to win his favor.</p><p>The Yuan Ying puppet was, after all, inanimate. As the controller, Gongliang Yu’s cultivation was far inferior to Dongyang Bo’s; this gap was not merely in cultivation, but something a puppet could not simply bridge.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was certainly confident of this, and seeing the Yuan Ying puppet, he still followed without hesitation.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang was curious about the treasure Gongliang Yu had found that could tempt Dongyang Bo to betray an ally.</p><p>As for bullying the weak?</p><p>Dongyang Bo had done that countless times, he'd long since lost any sense of shame.</p><p>While pondering these things, Qin Sang used his Celestial Eye to observe the inside of the Blood River, noticing some clues, and his eyes grew grave.</p><p>“No wonder Gongliang Yu summoned the Yuan Ying puppet…”</p><p>Seeing Gongliang Yu and Dongyang Bo going deeper into the Blood River, Qin Sang could wait no longer.  Secretly preparing his Eighteen Demon Banners formation, he entered the Blood River.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>Instead of gentle currents, he was met with a ferocious gale. The surface of the blood mist appeared calm, but inside, it was a chaotic collision of turbulent currents.</p><p>Along with the impact of the blood mist came an extremely intense, evil energy.</p><p>This evil energy was almost tangible, like scraping steel blades, a blood-and-flesh grinder, constantly assaulting the protective spirit armor Qin Sang had formed with his true essence, attempting to grind him into bloody water.</p><p>‘Hiss… hiss…’</p><p>To resist the evil invasion, Qin Sang had to increase his true essence, greatly increasing his consumption.</p><p>Simultaneously with the evil energy assault, several long snake-like blood shadows silently emerged from the blood mist and lunged at Qin Sang upon sensing him.</p><p>These blood shadows were insubstantial, some several meters long, others only a meter.</p><p>Amidst the chaotic blood mist and the pervasive, terrifying evil energy, they were fearless, at ease, and moved freely.</p><p>The few Qin Sang had startled were just a tiny fraction.</p><p>In the entire Blood River, countless blood shadows, millions, if not tens of millions, were impossible to avoid.</p><p>These blood shadows were evil spirits nurtured by the Blood River's accumulated blood mist over many years.  Born and raised there, they constantly absorbed the evil energy and grew, thus unaffected by it.</p><p>In other words, they were the masters of the Blood River.</p><p>Startled by Qin Sang, all the blood shadows attacked without hesitation.  They possessed little intelligence, driven by a single instinct: to devour the intruder.</p><p>Before the blood shadows could get close, Qin Sang paused slightly, revealing the Fire Lotus Seed in his forehead.  Several small, flower-like sparks of spirit fire lightly floated out, accurately targeting all the blood shadows, arriving before them.</p><p>These spirit flames were refined by Qin Sang, their fluctuations minimized.  As they reached the blood shadows, the latter felt no danger, remaining oblivious.</p><p>By the time they reacted after being touched by the flames, it was too late.</p><p>The flames swiftly spread over the blood shadows, instantly burning them to ashes, leaving no trace.</p><p>Then the flames returned to the Fire Lotus Seed.</p><p>All this happened incredibly fast.  The blood shadows and the Fire Lotus Seed showed no significant fluctuations.  The chaotic blood mist helped conceal the action, which is why Gongliang Yu and Dongyang Bo remained unaware.</p><p>“Although the Nine Netherworld Magic Fire isn’t specifically for suppressing evil spirits, these evil spirits are only at the Qi Condensation stage at most; killing them is as easy as turning the palm of my hand.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>However, these blood shadows are among the weakest.  The deeper into the Blood River, the stronger they become. If thousands of blood shadows are disturbed at the bottom, even a Yuan Ying cultivator would be in serious danger.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang cautiously extended his spiritual sense, immediately attracting a dozen blood shadows, which he swiftly eliminated.</p><p>"As I suspected! These blood shadows are similar to blood thunder; they're highly sensitive to spiritual sense. It's best not to spread my spiritual sense too far here.  Who knows what monsters lurk at the bottom of the Blood River? This is good, too; it reduces the chance of Dongyang Bo noticing me."</p><p>Having ascertained the blood shadows' abilities, Qin Sang continued his descent.</p><p>However, he deliberately slowed his pace to increase the distance between himself and Dongyang Bo.</p><p>This was unavoidable. The number of blood shadows in the Blood River was immense. Even without using spiritual sense, it was impossible to avoid them all.</p><p>In the upper reaches, even a large number of blood shadows wouldn't cause much trouble.</p><p>But deeper down, the blood shadows became stronger and harder to kill. Qin Sang didn't know what methods Dongyang Bo possessed, so he dared not follow too closely.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, whose target was Gong Liangyu, had no such worries and remained close behind.</p><p>Qin Sang lagged far behind, maintaining just enough use of his celestial eye ability to barely track Dongyang Bo's movements. Gong Liangyu had a Yuan Ying spirit puppet, capable of holding off Dongyang Bo for some time – enough time for Qin Sang to arrive.</p><p>The celestial eye butterfly not only kept Dongyang Bo in sight but also revealed the blood shadows' movements.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully chose paths with fewer blood shadows, minimizing his presence.</p><p>The Blood River was bottomless.</p><p>Gong Liangyu traveled for a full incense stick's worth of time without reaching the riverbed.</p><p>Lacking the celestial eye butterfly's ability to discern the density of blood shadows, he could only rely on his Yuan Ying spirit puppet to force his way through.</p><p>Countless blood shadows attacked relentlessly, surrounding them.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The Yuan Ying spirit puppet was incredibly powerful, seemingly venting its anger on the blood shadows.  Its talismanic light blazed, its movements lightning-fast, its blows like thunder, leaving trails of afterimages.</p><p>The blood shadows here were far stronger than those in the upper reaches, but they couldn't withstand a single blow; their bodies shattered instantly and failed to reconstitute.</p><p>All the blood shadows were held at bay by the Yuan Ying spirit puppet, unable to approach.</p><p>Behind Gong Liangyu, Dongyang Bo was also beset by blood shadows, though Gong Liangyu had drawn some of them away. While more continuously drifted in from elsewhere, their numbers were fewer.</p>
