<h1>Chapter 514: Various Transformations</h1><p>The first wisp of Earthly Yin Qi successfully entered Qin Sang's Qi Sea, signifying the completion of a crucial step in the corpse refinement restriction.  With his prior experience in corpse refinement and his exceptional self-control, everything had proceeded smoothly so far.</p><p>But he dared not relax, for the true difficulties were yet to come.</p><p>Patiently, Qin Sang guided wisp after wisp of Earthly Yin Qi into his body, gradually completing the corpse refinement restriction. As the restriction neared completion, his physical body didn't change much, but the sensations he experienced grew more pronounced: increasingly cold blood, a growing thirst for bloodâ€¦</p><p>None of this could shake his resolve.  The Jade Buddha kept his mind as still as water, completely unaffected by these desires.</p><p>Only the intense pain emanating from his dantian caused him, with his formidable willpower, to grit his teeth and endure.  He periodically consumed healing pills to alleviate the agony.</p><p>Fortunately, thanks to Wu Shang's documented experience, Qin Sang was well prepared and able to withstand it.</p><p>As another wisp of Earthly Yin Qi successfully entered his Qi Sea, a hint of joy flickered across Qin Sang's face, but it was quickly replaced by a serious and cautious expression.</p><p>Next came the final restriction for refining a living corpse.  Although the process had been smooth sailing until now, Qin Sang couldn't shake a sense of unease.</p><p>Could the altered restrictions, painstakingly modified by Wu Shang, truly be completed without incident, as his notes claimed?  If this step failed, then infusing his body with the refined elixir would be out of the question.</p><p>Now was the moment of truth!</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened slightly.  His hands formed seals with lightning speed, a dizzying display of complex hand gestures.  Countless intricate seals materialized before him, then, under his guidance, drifted towards his body.</p><p>Finally, the last seal was complete!</p><p>"Merge!"</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly flipped his palm and pressed it against his dantian without hesitation.</p><p>The restriction closed!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang's face turned deathly pale.  The agonizing pain from his Qi Sea made his body tremble violently.  He groaned, clutching his dantian tightly.</p><p>Within his Qi Sea, a tumultuous clash between spiritual energy and Earthly Yin Qi erupted. A terrifying storm instantly engulfed his Qi Sea, spiraling out of his control.  The barrier constructed from the Five Elements Yin objects showed signs of instability.</p><p>Fortunately, their presence bought him a moment to recover.</p><p>He took a deep breath and straightened abruptly.  A fierce glint flashed in his eyes.  Focusing his entire being, he drew upon his past experience with corpse refinement to try and suppress the unruly Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>Initially, the restrictions on his body threatened to collapse.  The Earthly Yin Qi within his dantian resisted fiercely. But as time passed, the fluctuations in Qin Sang's body gradually subsided, and his expression grew calmer.</p><p>For a fleeting moment, the pain from his dantian vanished.</p><p>Startled, Qin Sang quickly inspected his internal state.  He found that the storm within his Qi Sea had calmed and was stabilizing. The Earthly Yin Qi and spiritual energy coexisted peacefully, each occupying half of his Qi Sea.</p><p>With a thought, he separated a portion of both the Earthly Yin Qi and spiritual energy.  They merged and flowed smoothly into his meridians, beginning to circulate.</p><p>Did it work?</p><p>Overjoyed, Qin Sang rose to his feet, moved around a bit, and carefully examined the changes in his physical body.</p><p>A short while later, he opened his eyes, his expression a mixture of joy and concern.</p><p>The joy stemmed from the confirmation of Wu Shang's notes. Every word proved true.  He had indeed recorded his secret method without reservation.  Qin Sang had successfully completed this step.  The moment the restriction was complete, his physical transformation into a corpse accelerated dramatically, though the extent was far less than that of a true living corpse.</p><p>This was due to Wu Shang's modifications to the restriction, and Qin Sang's precise control over his own body, which allowed him to barely complete the process.</p><p>For a short period, the transformation could be kept within an acceptable range.  As long as he undid the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the corpse refinement restriction in time, recovery shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>His concern arose from the current circulation path of the Earthly Yin Qi and spiritual energy within his body. It wasn't the path dictated by the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* cultivation technique, but a fixed route dictated by the corpse refinement restriction.  No matter how he tried, Qin Sang couldn't alter it.</p><p>With a thought, spiritual energy and Yin Qi flowed from his palm simultaneously, their combined power even greater than before he became a living corpse.  It seemed that while channeling them for combat wasn't affected, he could no longer cultivate.</p><p>Even though he retained his consciousness, his inability to cultivate meant his cultivation level would remain stagnant, forever frozen at this point.</p><p>To make matters worse, the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* was restricted, rendering its two divine abilities, Human-Sword Unity, Shadowless Escape, and Sword Qi Thunderclap, unusable.</p><p>The loss of Sword Qi Thunderclap, in particular, was a significant blow, as it was Qin Sang's greatest asset.  Without it, both his strength and speed would be severely diminished.</p><p>Fortunately, the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* was merely restricted, not replaced by another technique.  While the divine abilities were temporarily unavailable, the Ebony Sword remained his natal spirit sword, still under his control. Its inherent power as a magical treasure was a considerable advantage.</p><p>Furthermore, having mastered the two divine abilities for so long, Qin Sang had gained valuable insights, giving him a significant edge in swordsmanship compared to other cultivators.</p><p>He wondered if refining the Corpse Elixir would change anything.  After all, Wu Shang had only used Earthly Yin Qi to refine his elixir, while Qin Sang intended to utilize both Earthly Yin Qi and Heavenly Yang Qi.  Their paths were different, and the eventual outcomes would certainly differ as well. Wu Shang's experience might not apply to him.</p><p>This was the reason Qin Sang dared to attempt this.</p><p>[Read books and earn cash] Follow the official vx public account [Book Friends Base Camp] Read books and earn cash!</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang retrieved the Corpse Puppet Bag, his expression shifting between uncertainty and contemplation.  He had never been a refined corpse and didn't know what it felt like to be inside a Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>Hesitantly, he opened the bag and pointed it at himself.</p><p>A moment later, a puzzled look appeared on his face. Nothing happened.</p><p>Could the Corpse Puppet Bag not contain him?</p><p>Was it the Jade Buddha?</p><p>Or was it because Wu Shang had drastically altered the corpse refinement restrictions, making him not a true living corpse, causing a conflict with the Corpse Puppet Bag's restrictions?</p><p>Wu Shang hadn't tried putting himself into a Corpse Puppet Bag after becoming a living corpse, so lacking any prior experience, Qin Sang could only speculate.</p><p>It shouldn't be because he hadn't lost his consciousness.  Senior Sister Qing Ting had placed Senior Brother Jiang into a Corpse Puppet Bag while he was still alive.</p><p>However, Senior Brother Jiang had been placed inside a crystal coffin first, which might have been related to the Heavenly Corpse Sect.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had given the crystal coffin to Tan Hao, so there was no way to verify.</p><p>Corpse Puppet Bags were incredibly difficult to refine.  The Heavenly Corpse Sect's bags, while seemingly ordinary in appearance, were unique to the sect and could hold living corpses.</p><p>Corpse Puppet Bags from other corpse refinement sects were even less effective.</p><p>Within the Heavenly Corpse Sect, only high-ranking members or those who had made significant contributions were rewarded with Corpse Puppet Bags. The first half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* didn't include the method for refining them.</p><p>Confused, Qin Sang tried several times, but ultimately gave up and retrieved a coffin from his Mustard Seed Bag.</p>
