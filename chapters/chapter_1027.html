<h1>Chapter 1119: The Glacial Plain</h1><p>Sword light blazed, forming a whirling sword wheel that sliced at the puppet beasts!</p><p>Qin Sang, wielding his spirit sword, battled the puppet beasts.</p><p>Surrounded by the beasts, Qin Sang's senses were locked down by the sword energy.</p><p>He comprehended the sword intent within the puppet sword formation, attacking with all his might to unleash the formation's true power, awakening the Sky Eye Butterfly to decipher the array.</p><p>It was impossible to fully grasp this sword formation within an incense stick's time, but he aimed to memorize its changes as much as possible, integrating them into his sword wheel later.</p><p>The puppet sword formation was exceptionally strong.</p><p>It was certain that the creator of the puppets possessed extremely high swordsmanship, seamlessly integrating a complete sword formation into the puppets themselves.</p><p>After an incense stick of time.</p><p>The myriad sword lights suddenly dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his sword, still feeling invigorated.</p><p>He wondered what kind of force the Seven Killing Hall was at its peak.</p><p>The sword path and the puppet sword formation were, for sword cultivators, akin to the best teachers.</p><p>If one could cultivate in such an environment, their swordsmanship wouldn't necessarily advance by leaps and bounds daily, but at least comprehending sword intent would be no difficult task.  It was a true sword cultivator's paradise.</p><p>Bai, who had been standing in the corner, approached and asked Qin Sang for a blank jade slip.  Moments later, he returned it.</p><p>“This is a little something I comprehended from observing the sword formation. Your inside perspective and my outside observation gave us a complete picture. With enough refinement, we should be able to reconstruct most of the formation. This puppet sword formation is unique; it feels like a simplification of some top-tier sword formation.  If we can unravel it, the gains will be significant.”</p><p>Qin Sang received the jade slip, delighted. He thanked Bai and put it away.</p><p>Now was not the time to study the sword formation.</p><p>Bai looked around and pointed behind him.  “That should be the entrance to the next trial.  You mentioned earlier that the Soul Cleansing Liquid benefits the soul. Perhaps it could help me as well.  Would you perhaps…”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. Before Bai could finish, he readily made a promise.</p><p>Bai's advancement to the Corpse King realm would be a significant help to Qin Sang, and he would do his utmost to secure a second Soul Cleansing Liquid if the opportunity arose.</p><p>After the puppet beasts vanished, two doors appeared on either side of the hall.</p><p>Clearly, one led to the next trial, and the other was a teleportation point to the inner hall's entrance.</p><p>Bai returned to his corpse puppet bag.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped towards the next trial. The moment he crossed the threshold, that familiar feeling returned—darkness descended.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's expression changed as he found himself in a vast icy plain.</p><p>"The Glacial Plain?"</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, a world of sparkling ice.</p><p>"It is the Glacial Plain. This trial is fairly standard. One needs to constantly use True Qi to shield against the cold and be wary of the occasional beast attacks.  Beyond that, there isn't much danger."</p><p>A howling wind swept across the plain. Qin Sang raised his hands, and a thin layer of ice instantly spread from his fingertips upwards.</p><p>Bitterly cold.</p><p>"The farther you go, the colder it gets. Ordinary cultivators have fragile bodies, and merely resisting the cold consumes a massive amount of True Qi.  If they exhaust too much, an attack by a beast could be fatal. However, this cold is nothing to me.”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, his tone supremely confident.</p><p>Then, a blue light flashed from him, wings sprouting from his back—he had activated his Celestial Demon Transformation.</p><p>With the Celestial Demon Transformation active, the Glacial Plain's cold posed no threat.</p><p>Qin Sang checked his condition, a smile appearing on his face as he looked ahead.</p><p>“It's said that several locations within the Glacial Plain have rare spiritual herbs not easily found elsewhere. Similar treasures exist in other trial realms, rewards for those with good fortune. Not all participants seek only the final prize; many come for these opportunities. Given my body's strength, staying in the Glacial Plain and collecting those herbs wouldn't be difficult. But spending too much time will make me miss the Soul Cleansing Liquid.”</p><p>These thoughts raced through Qin Sang's mind. He flapped his phoenix wings, skimming across the ice towards the front.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly also used its Sky Eye ability to watch out for the ice layer below.</p><p>Most beasts emerged from beneath the ice.</p><p>Sure enough.</p><p>Not far ahead, the ice layer suddenly collapsed. A white light shot out, speeding toward him—a slender ice python, no thicker than a man's arm.</p><p>A stench filled the air.</p><p>The ice python opened its mouth, revealing its fangs, aggressive and ferocious.</p><p>Suddenly, sword light appeared.</p><p>The ice python instinctively sensed danger, but it was too late to escape.</p><p>The Blackwood Sword, swift as lightning, pierced the ice python's mouth, silencing its roar before easily cleaving its body in two from head to tail.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The sword light vanished. Qin Sang didn't even look at the python's corpse; he simply flashed past.</p><p>……</p><p>Elsewhere in the Xuanbing Plain.</p><p>A young man appeared out of thin air. His face, initially pale, lit up with surprise upon seeing the icy expanse.  "The second trial is the Xuanbing Plain! Excellent!"</p><p>His cultivation was only at the mid-Core Formation stage. He had used every trick to pass the first trial, the puppet battle, and thought he had little chance here.  But this second trial was one of his targets.</p><p>"幽晶 Flower, here I come!"</p><p>He licked his lips, muttered an incantation, and his true essence surged. A fiery robe instantly formed around him, a testament to his cold-weather techniques.</p><p>Simultaneously, he produced a strange red crystal, radiating warmth—another cold-weather artifact.</p><p>He was clearly well-prepared.</p><p>He surveyed his surroundings, chose a direction, and swiftly departed.</p><p>……</p><p>In another part of the Xuanbing Plain.</p><p>A large hole marred the icy surface.</p><p>Beside the fractured ice lay two translucent ice lizards, stiff and lifeless.  A pool of frozen blue blood lay beneath them.</p><p>Standing near the corpses was a young woman, Su Nu.</p><p>She had slain the lizards.</p><p>Despite the battle, she showed no injuries whatsoever.  She wore a high-quality red robe that dispelled the cold, allowing her to remain comfortable in this freezing environment.</p><p>Su Nu gazed towards the far end of the plain, but didn't immediately leave.  She held a black token, lost in thought.</p><p>After a while...</p><p>Su Nu gritted her teeth, seemingly making a difficult decision. She patted her storage pouch.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>Several rays of light shot out, revealing several identical jade bracelets.</p><p>Su Nu muttered something as she looked at them.</p><p>Soon, the bracelets were subtly inserted into the ice below.  Their transparency blended seamlessly with the ice, and the chaotic battlefield concealed them completely.</p><p>After concealing the bracelets, a fierce look flashed in Su Nu's eyes. She raised her hand, her true essence flickering, and struck her chest.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>Su Nu groaned, spitting out blood—a shockingly vivid crimson.</p><p>She had deliberately injured herself.</p><p>Unsatisfied, she secretly damaged several meridians, her face turning pale.</p><p>Then, she took out a cushion, set up some warning formations, and sat down, deciding to remain.</p>
