<h1>Chapter 776: Encounter</h1><p>Adult Red-tailed Cranes were still guarding the nest.</p><p>Qin Sang climbed silently, approaching the nest.</p><p>The guarding crane stood at the edge of the crevice, watching the chase below. Sensing something, it turned towards where Qin Sang was hiding.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the cranes' sharp senses and, realizing he'd been discovered, immediately activated his talisman, rushing towards the crevice at full speed.</p><p>The escaping light rapidly grew larger in the crane's eyes.</p><p>The crane raised its head and screamed, spreading its wings. Just as it flew out of the crevice, it saw a black fireball flying towards it.</p><p>The aura emanating from the fireball startled it.</p><p>In haste, the crane swung its long tail. The red tail, like a lit feather fan, lashed out with a dazzling red light.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Nine Nether Demon Fire erupted.</p><p>The crane shrieked as it was flung away. The red light was shattered by the demonic fire, and the beautiful red tail lost most of its feathers, turning it into a bald-tailed crane, a pitiful sight.</p><p>However, despite its appearance, the crane wasn't seriously injured. It quickly stabilized itself. Turning back to intercept Qin Sang, it discovered that the escaping light was too fast, having already rushed into the nest during the brief opening.</p><p>The crane shrieked repeatedly.</p><p>On the ground.</p><p>The Two-Headed Vulture was running for its life, continuously splitting into illusory copies to distract the cranes. Even so, it suffered several claw marks on its back, relentlessly pursued by the cranes.</p><p>Finally reaching the river valley, it jumped into the water without hesitation.</p><p>Just then, the cranes discovered the intruder in their nest and became enraged, immediately abandoning the Two-Headed Vulture and screaming towards the nest.</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing this inside the nest, felt his scalp tingle.</p><p>If trapped in the nest by the cranes, his escape techniques would be useless.</p><p>Seeing the young cranes knocked over by the Nine Nether Demon Fire's aftershocks, he ignored them, flashing towards the ancient vine without any trouble.</p><p>The vine climbed the rocks, its top hanging down, bearing a cluster of fruits.</p><p>Five of them had turned red, almost ripe. The others were small, green fruits, clearly lacking medicinal properties. Qin Sang swiftly took out a jade box, plucked the five red fruits, and turned to flee.</p><p>Even the young cranes were furious, but too weak to stop him.</p><p>Qin Sang used the same tactic again, unleashing the Nine Nether Demon Fire to repel the guarding crane. Flying out of the crevice and seeing the adult cranes chasing him, he didn't hesitate, activating his escape light and heading straight into the depths of the mountains.</p><p>For a time, the mountains echoed with the angry cries of the cranes.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't look back as the flock pursued him, quickly crossing two mountains.</p><p>The difference in speed became apparent. Even the crane leader, flapping its wings frantically, couldn't catch up to Qin Sang, gradually being left behind.</p><p>Qin Sang had planned his escape route.  Crossing the third mountain, the moment he left the cranes' sight, he swerved and jumped into a ravine, diving into the water and using the river to mask his presence.</p><p>Having lost sight of the thief, the enraged cranes bombarded the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang had drifted downstream to a river junction where he sensed the Two-Headed Vulture's presence.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Water sprayed as Qin Sang surfaced in the middle of the river. He saw the Two-Headed Vulture on the riverbank, licking its wounds.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the Two-Headed Vulture quickly got up, hopped to the bank, and looked at him expectantly, while remaining wary of the direction Qin Sang had come from.</p><p>"Don't you trust my escape speed?"</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the bank, his spiritual light flashing, evaporating the water.</p><p>Stealing the fruits had been surprisingly smooth.</p><p>Fortunately, the flock of Red-tailed Cranes wasn't large, their flight speed wasn't fast, and there were no other fierce beasts nearby. Otherwise, even with his speed, being pursued for too long would have attracted other beasts, putting him in a dangerous siege.</p><p>The Two-Headed Vulture chirped anxiously.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the jade box, pointed to one of the fruits, and said, "Stop looking. This one's yours! If you're worried, add your own seal."</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Two-Headed Vulture's eyes flashed. It conjured a gust of green wind, landing on the fruit and forming a green ring.</p><p>"You really dare…"</p><p>Qin Sang glared at it. The Two-Headed Vulture scurried to the side, tucking its tail and grinning sheepishly.</p><p>Lying in the jade box, away from the dark crevice, the spiritual fruits revealed more details.  Reddish streaks seemed to run through their skin.</p><p>Some fruits had denser streaks, others sparser, indicating varying degrees of ripeness.</p><p>Unfortunately, the fruits had no scent, perhaps because they weren't fully mature.</p><p>Qin Sang searched his memory of ancient texts and scrolls, but found no record of similar fruits.  Even the old vine itself was unheard of.</p><p>He would have to find a way to research them.  He wouldn't dare consume them before understanding their properties.</p><p>Putting away the jade box, Qin Sang changed course, continuing towards the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>After crossing a few mountains, he stopped abruptly, frowning at the valley to his left.</p><p>Lush grass filled the valley, with thick forests on both sides almost concealing it. Qin Sang only noticed the valley upon reaching this point.</p><p>Within the valley were several thatched huts.</p><p>Clearly from ancient times, the huts were enveloped in a shimmering barrier, likely formed by some spirit array. Protected by the barrier, the huts showed no signs of decay.</p><p>Two people stood before the huts, warily watching Qin Sang.</p><p>Their gazes met.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed they held strange wooden shuttles, seemingly trying to break the barrier.  Their efforts were actually causing ripples on the barrier's surface.</p><p>Delighted by the barrier's reaction, they momentarily lowered their guard, surprised by Qin Sang's sudden appearance. They exchanged glances, then became highly alert.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's cultivation level, a sharp glint flashed in their eyes.  However, sensing the Two-Headed Vulture's presence, they were stunned and bewildered.</p><p>Someone who could control such a powerful beast… Could this person be hiding their true strength?</p><p>They clearly took Qin Sang for an unassuming, powerful expert.</p><p>"One late Core Formation, one slightly weaker than Cui Ji. Both are formidable opponents."</p><p>Qin Sang discerned their cultivation levels and their change in demeanor.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang continued walking with the Two-Headed Vulture.</p><p>If they tried to silence him, he wouldn't make it easy for them.</p><p>The huts' location suggested they had been looted many times. Whether any treasures remained was unknown.  He wouldn't initiate a fight and create unnecessary complications. Unless he used the Fire Pearl, even driving them away would waste considerable time.</p><p>They watched each other until they disappeared from sight, neither making a move. The anticipated battle didn't occur.</p>
