<h1>Chapter 1228: Inheritance</h1><p>Arriving at an open area, Qin Sang spared no effort in activating his divine sense, keenly observing its fluctuations. During the process of subduing the spirit flames, he could feel each flame merging with a strand of his divine sense, as if creating a small fiery avatar that tempered and strengthened each strand. He had never engaged in a pure divine sense battle with other Nascent Soul cultivators, so he wasn’t certain of his exact strength in this regard, but he was confident it surpassed that of his peers.</p><p>“The arduous cultivation over the past year hasn’t been in vain. My divine sense has improved significantly. Once the Fire Lotus Seed sprouts and I truly step into the second layer, my divine sense will undergo another leap. Old Demon Mou probably couldn’t bear to refine the Winter Nether Cold Flame completely, but if he had, it might have helped him break through to the second layer, making his divine sense at least on par with the likes of the Demon Lord, if not surpassing them. That would have allowed him to escape the joint siege of the righteous and demonic factions and later feign death at Yitian Peak, deceiving everyone.”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang retracted his divine sense and summoned the eighteen Demon Banners with a wave of his hand. These were the true focus.</p><p>Whoosh, whoosh...</p><p>Twelve of the banners flew into the air, forming an array and releasing demonic flames. Qin Sang had long been able to control twelve banners, and without pause, the Fire Lotus Seed flashed from between his brows and flew to the center of the array, merging with the demonic flames. He then raised his hand and summoned three more banners.</p><p>The three banners integrated into the array, stabilizing after a slight tremor. From within, the Nine Nether Demonic Flames emerged, swirling obediently around the Fire Lotus Seed. Seeing this, Qin Sang was delighted. Controlling fifteen banners didn’t feel beyond his limits, so he decisively threw in the remaining three.</p><p>As for the last banner, part of its demonic flames had been refined by Qin Sang, making it incompatible with the array. Forcing it in would destabilize the formation, doing more harm than good. The other banners made space, allowing the three to join.</p><p>However, as soon as the grand array formed, an unexpected change occurred. All eighteen banners began to tremble violently. The banner surfaces flapped wildly, and the poles shook, some even tilting. The Nine Nether Demonic Flames surged like turbulent waves, disrupting the surrounding spiritual energy. The demonic flames clashed with each other, threatening to break free from the array and escape Qin Sang’s control.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression shifted slightly. He channeled all his power, his fingers moving like a wheel as countless restrictions poured into the array. Gritting his teeth, he stabilized the banners with great effort, barely quelling the chaos. He would need to refine them further before he could wield them freely.</p><p>The banners and flames finally stabilized. The eighteen Demon Banners stood in the void, forming a circle above Qin Sang’s head. At the center of the array, the Fire Lotus Seed served as the core, with the Nine Nether Demonic Flames coalescing into a majestic black fire dragon, exuding an overwhelming demonic aura!</p><p>With a flick of his divine sense, Qin Sang directed the demonic flames to charge toward a mountain peak to the left.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The pristine snow melted instantly. Dust and debris erupted, and the ground shook violently as the mountain crumbled.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang’s eyes sparkled with excitement. He laughed heartily, then retrieved the banners and returned to Sandie Pass to continue his secluded cultivation.</p><p>---</p><p>Sandie Pass had become a training ground for the demons of Thousand Bamboo Sea and disciples like Li Yufu. Qin Sang had already revealed his identity and transferred Mei Gu and other disciples of the Demonic Flame Sect from Shiqu Mountain.</p><p>When Mei Gu learned that her master was actually a demon king, she was stunned for a long time. However, the Small Cold Domain had always been a place where humans and demons coexisted, bound by ancient covenants. The hatred and barriers between the two races weren’t as severe as in the Canglang Sea, so she eventually accepted it.</p><p>At first, Mei Gu was uneasy, but when she saw that her master treated both human and demon disciples equally, offering guidance without favoritism and demonstrating profound knowledge of human cultivation, she felt reassured.</p><p>Still, Mei Gu had some doubts. When her master first appeared, he had taken human form. Had he already reached the Transformation Stage back then? Or did his unique bloodline allow him to assume human form without reaching that stage? These questions would remain unanswered.</p><p>As for the other Demonic Flame Sect disciples, having been oppressed by other major powers for so long, they were overjoyed to finally have a powerful backer. Whether he was a Nascent Soul cultivator or a demon king mattered little to them.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang’s forces were largely consolidated. All that remained was to find a suitable blessed land to establish a sect and pass down the legacy of Qingyang Temple.</p><p>First, there was the Thousand Bamboo Sea lineage. In the future, a few demonic cultivators would be selected to inherit the *Heavenly Demon Transformation Art*, supporting each other alongside human disciples.</p><p>Second, there was the legacy of Wanderer, including his cultivation techniques and alchemy, which Li Yufu would carry forward.</p><p>Third, there was the Demonic Flame Sect lineage, led by Mei Gu. The *Seven Yang Art*, carefully selected by the Robed Daoist, was a fine inheritance.</p><p>As for Qin Sang himself, most of the techniques and secret arts he practiced were unsuitable for others. At most, he could leave behind some of his cultivation insights and previously obtained techniques, such as the *Dutian Demonic Sound*.</p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang had long considered developing a sword cultivation lineage within Qingyang Temple to inherit the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*, continuing the legacy of Senior Green Bamboo. Senior Green Bamboo had devoted his life to the sword, pouring his heart and soul into creating the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*. One didn’t need to practice the *Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter* to comprehend it; any sword cultivator with sufficient talent could study it.</p><p>Qin Sang had only borrowed from it, and it would be a waste in his hands. He had consulted his senior sister about this.</p><p>“You are the successor he chose. I won’t interfere. It’s entirely up to you,” she had said.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu wasn’t suitable, lacking the necessary talent. Someone else would need to be found.</p><p>The Small Cold Domain wasn’t like the Canglang Sea. Most of the top spiritual mountains were already claimed. Careful planning would be required. However, with the current turmoil, opportunities were bound to arise for someone of his strength.</p><p>Once Qingyang Temple was established, half of Wanderer’s wishes would be fulfilled.</p><p>“Are you satisfied with this arrangement, Senior?” Qin Sang murmured, holding the charred wood left by Wanderer.</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, he could faintly sense a weak true spirit within the wood, which wouldn’t dissipate anytime soon. Given the uncertain situation, he dared not refine the wood yet, fearing it might render the Ebony Sword unusable or cause other unforeseen issues. He needed to carefully consider every step before acting.</p><p>Refining the last trace of Wanderer’s true spirit couldn’t be done as roughly as before. There was no room for error, and no amount of caution was excessive.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Bing Han’s invitation. For now, he needed to continue refining the demonic flames and familiarize himself with the eighteen Demon Banners to prepare for entering the Blood Lake. After returning from the Blood Lake, he would visit the Ethereal Spirit Sect to study some texts before making further plans.</p><p>The charred wood remained silent, offering no answer.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, a hint of melancholy in his eyes as he stored the wood away.</p><p>News from Wuyu Valley continued to arrive, but the timing of the Blood Lake’s opening remained uncertain. The war on Tianxing Plateau raged on, though the Sin Abyss’s momentum had noticeably weakened, likely due to Old Demon Ye’s schemes involving the Blood Lake.</p><p>One day, while deep in cultivation, Qin Sang received a message from his senior sister. Upon hearing the news, he felt a surge of joy. His senior sister had deciphered the formation diagram of the Demon-Binding Rope and invited him to Shiqu Mountain to offer his insights.</p>
