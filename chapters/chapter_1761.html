<h1>Chapter 1752  The Spirit Beast</h1><p>Gods are appointed by humans!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.</p><p>He had learned from the hyena demon that city gods under the Daoist Court's jurisdiction were responsible not only for controlling the demons and ghosts within their territory but also for dispatching troops to capture any that caused trouble, preventing disturbance to the populace.</p><p>Furthermore, in this world, when mortals worshiped gods, gathering at local temples, the deities could use the opportunity to cleanse the Six Heavens' residual energy from the mortals' bodies during the rituals.</p><p>Outside the Daoist Court's control, however, mortals faced a much harsher existence; left to fend for themselves, they were said to resemble demons and were called "ghost people."</p><p>Based on this, could the Daoist Court be maintaining order in this world by appointing deities?</p><p>Qin Sang knew little about the divine way and couldn't figure out how it worked.  He had no intention of becoming a god; besides being under the Daoist Court's jurisdiction and unable to leave his assigned territory, he was unsure what other restrictions he would face in his cultivation, essentially being controlled for his entire life.</p><p>But receiving an appointment also required the Daoist Court’s altar or those of various sects, clearly not an easy task.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang looked at the hyena demon again.  This demon had seized the altar after destroying it and could still control the altar and command the spirit soldiers.  Could there be some mystery to it?</p><p>Upon being questioned by Qin Sang, the hyena demon guessed his thoughts, realizing this Daoist priest was no ordinary person and became more cautious.</p><p>Thinking about this, it secretly lamented its situation.</p><p>Many crucial aspects became clear only after seizing the altar.</p><p>The hyena demon’s former master was a True Person of the Sheng Xuan level.</p><p>The hyena demon wasn't a regular soldier of the Danxiao Mansion.  Its master, seeing its exceptional talent potentially useful as a unique weapon, had taken it in.  Unbeknownst to the master, it was welcoming a calamity.</p><p>The True Person, having encountered a strong enemy, was severely injured, and his personal guards were slaughtered. Coincidentally, he obtained an extremely useful artifact for the hyena demon, which emboldened it to act.  Seizing the opportunity, it rebelled and, with its wolf soldiers, destroyed the altar.</p><p>After betraying its master and seizing the altar, the hyena demon could still utilize it because the soldiers and the Daoist had always jointly focused their thoughts on the deity, establishing a connection. Therefore, the hyena demon could still use and receive protection from the altar.</p><p>However, the hyena demon was merely an usurper, not the rightful owner.</p><p>During cultivation, focusing on the deity required the altar master's guidance to unify the thoughts of the soldiers and invoke the heavens, thus communicating with the deity.</p><p>The hyena demon, unaware of these intricacies, couldn't continue its focus and couldn't influence the altar’s guardian spirits at all.  It could only passively receive protection, greatly reducing its effectiveness.</p><p>At the time, the hyena demon was only at the late-stage of the Demon Core realm. Initially, it didn't notice anything unusual and thought its plan had succeeded. Only after it used the artifact to break through to the Transformation stage did it realize that the guardian spirits could no longer fully protect it.</p><p>As the hyena demon's cultivation grew, the protection would weaken further.</p><p>For a demon cultivator like it, chaotic energy was actually beneficial for refining its body; the most important thing was the protection of the guardian spirits.</p><p>If it simply sought a leisurely life, as long as it controlled its violent nature, it shouldn’t lose its sanity within its lifespan.</p><p>However, this hyena demon was also ambitious. As its cultivation deepened, even if there were no obvious changes in the short term, the accumulated effect would eventually lead it down the same path as its predecessors.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered these words.</p><p>Upon hearing about the method of focusing on the deity, he initially assumed it was a type of visualization technique. He had encountered such methods long ago.</p><p>At the beginning of his cultivation of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, he had to visualize a powerful demon; he chose the Azure-colored Luan bird. Using his human form to cultivate this technique not only helped him cultivate a pair of thunder wings but, after integrating the Luan bird's blood essence, even gave birth to a Heavenly Demon Dharma Form. This proved the visualization technique was not mere illusion.</p><p>But now, hearing the hyena demon's explanation, Qin Sang realized that focusing on the deity was more than just simple visualization.</p><p>If it were just visualization, after the altar's master died, the guardian spirits would lose their foundation. Even if they could continue to exist, they'd be mere inanimate objects.</p><p>The hyena demon, as a transformed demon, whose cultivation was not much different from its former master, could not influence them at all.</p><p>Therefore, the key must be in the "altar," which must possess unique power.</p><p>"Celestial Gods…"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>If there really were gods overlooking the mortal world and ruling the heavens, Bai would have mentioned it, as would the Ghost Mother, yet neither of them had said a word about such an important secret.</p><p>It was a pity the hyena demon had lost the altar; otherwise, he could have studied it.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't regret it.  Understanding the cultivation secrets of this world was already enough. He would have opportunities to witness the altar and its guardian spirits in the future.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang said, "Who ordered you to plot against the Tian Shu Academy's celestial officials?"</p><p>After learning about the Daoist Court's strength, he didn't want to offend such a powerful entity. The hyena demon should not have completely lost its mind, there must be a reason!</p><p>Without any hesitation, the hyena demon revealed everything.</p><p>After his breakthrough, he felt the path ahead was arduous and dared not wander under the Daoist Court's jurisdiction, lingering outside for days. He once considered going to the Demon Ghost Kingdom in the east, but the journey was too far and unsafe.</p><p>His identity as a rogue cultivator meant any Daoist master would immediately capture him on sight.</p><p>Wandering aimlessly, he unexpectedly stumbled upon a fortuitous encounter, accidentally meeting a transformed great demon.</p><p>This demon was a snake demon, never submitting to anyone, cultivating on its own. Its cultivation was higher than the wolf demon's, yet its mind was unaffected by the chaotic energy.</p><p>The wolf demon was overjoyed and sought its guidance. The snake demon didn't hide anything; it cultivated a demonic technique passed down from the Demon Ghost Kingdom, which it could share with the wolf demon, but demanded a Daoist Court official of at least the rank of sub-altar master as payment.</p><p>Killing a Daoist Court official was an unforgivable crime, even more so a sub-altar master.</p><p>However, the wolf demon, having already betrayed a master and offended the Danxiao Mansion, and with its own path at stake, didn't care about such consequences. After a moment's hesitation, it agreed.</p><p>The wolf demon, cunning by nature, carefully investigated and chose its target: a newly appointed, inexperienced altar master.  Unexpectedly, the opponent was far more skilled, resulting in failure and losses.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, "Demonic technique?"</p><p>Such techniques were not exclusive to the Daoist schools.</p><p>The existence of the Demon Ghost Kingdom, a nation of its own, implied a certain order and the ability to rival the Daoist Court, indicating considerable power.</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>He urgently needed to do two things.</p><p>First, to obtain a method to stabilize his vital energy and continue cultivating in this world.</p><p>Second, to confirm if tempering his body with chaotic energy would have any negative effects other than on his primordial spirit.</p><p>The divine path was unclear.</p><p>Since he saw hope in the Daoist technique system, he would not consider the divine path unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>While a protective deity wasn't essential for him,  he was now a Nascent Soul cultivator and required high-level techniques to support his cultivation.</p><p>From his understanding of the Daoist Court, it was strictly hierarchical, with almost no loopholes to exploit.  </p><p>The entire court was interconnected; any extreme measures could easily attract the attention of powerful masters, and Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.</p><p>Low-level techniques might be obtained by deception, but high-level techniques, whether from Daoist sects or the Court, would not be easily granted.  Facing a powerful master or even a True Monarch would leave him completely exposed.</p><p>Qin Sang had considered approaching the local powers, openly stating his origins, provided their cultivation wasn't exceptionally high.  If Nascent Soul cultivators held significant influence, they might be forced to cooperate.</p><p>Considering the Daoist Court's demonstrated strength, while Nascent Soul cultivators weren't weak, they wouldn't be highly valued.</p><p>Moreover, his current strength was far inferior to his past.</p><p>If his origins were investigated, he would be defenseless, and the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather might be revealed. This treasure was crucial to the revival of the Vermilion Bird and his cultivation, and he couldn't afford to lose it.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was struggling to find a solution, the wolf demon mentioned the demonic technique, giving him a sudden inspiration.</p><p>If the demonic technique could stabilize vital energy, he would need to be cautious. If it only protected the primordial spirit, he could safely temper his body with chaotic energy and quickly increase his strength.</p><p>He would focus on body refinement, gradually exploring, until his breakthrough in the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique would allow him to act more freely.</p><p>Furthermore, this demonic technique might allow him to glimpse the mysteries of Daoist techniques.</p><p>His mind racing, Qin Sang didn't act rashly. He noticed a discrepancy, "The snake demon's cave is in the westernmost part of the Daoist Court's territory. The Demon Ghost Kingdom is tens of thousands of miles away. Where did the snake demon obtain the demonic technique?"</p><p>According to the wolf demon, their Nine Dragon Country was located in the southwest of the Zhongmao region, bordering the sea.  Westward across a sub-altar's territory lay the westernmost edge of Zhongmao.</p><p>That area wasn't under the Daoist Court's control, with demons rampant but disorganized.  The Demon Ghost Kingdom was in the east, separated by the Daoist Court's dual jurisdiction; it was illogical for the technique to spread here.</p><p>The snake demon was hidden deep within.</p><p>"That's what I also wondered, but I was desperate then, afraid of angering the snake demon, and didn't dare ask more. Perhaps... perhaps..."</p><p>The wolf demon scratched its head, then its eyes lit up, "Perhaps a powerful being from our race passed down their teachings here to contain the Daoist Court!"</p><p>The more it spoke, the more it seemed plausible.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, thoughtfully.</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang didn't delay, immediately ordering the wolf demon to lead the way. The two of them traveled west along the coast.  The journey was uneventful; after more than a month, they arrived at a vast mountain range.</p><p>"Immortal, the place where I met the snake is just ahead."</p><p>The fox spirit, having only encountered the serpent spirit twice, noted its extreme caution.  Communication was limited to telepathic messages, its physical form remaining hidden.  A foolproof plan was needed to avoid alarming it and letting it escape.</p><p>The wolf spirit rose on its hind legs, bending low near Qin Sang in a fawning manner, offering suggestions.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the mountain peak, surveying the surrounding peaks, silent.</p><p>Since leaving the Daoist Court's jurisdiction, he sensed the increasingly rampant influence of the corrupted celestial Qi.  The further he ventured, the stronger it became, forcing him to expend more spiritual energy to stabilize his true essence.</p><p>Considering the Daoist Court's establishment of main, regional, and branch temples, Qin Sang believed there was a reason, though he was unsure of their precise function.</p><p>Then, piercing howls and the sounds of pursuit echoed from the mountain base.</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed it, but only now turned his gaze downwards.</p><p>Tree shadows swayed violently below, interspersed with the sound of snapping branches and rustling leaves.  A white figure leaped through the trees—a rabbit, large as a wolfhound, glancing back fearfully, clearly a rabbit spirit brimming with vitality.</p><p>A towering figure, over ten feet tall, with immensely powerful muscles, pursued it at breathtaking speed.  Its hands were larger than fans, its strength prodigious; a single clap could shatter a large tree.  The rabbit spirit stood no chance.</p><p>"Immortal, that's a Ghost-folk."</p><p>The wolf spirit pointed towards the figure, providing an introduction.</p><p>Despite the human-like figure's clear advantage, Qin Sang felt a growing sense of unease.  In the human world, this being would be a giant.  Though possessing human-like features, no one would mistake it for a human.  Yet, it was.</p><p>The reason was simple: long-term exposure to the corrupted celestial Qi, without the Daoist Court's protection, had wrought drastic changes.  The Ghost-folk possessed iron-hard bodies and immense strength, surpassing ordinary humans, but at the cost of diminished intelligence.</p><p>The beastly nature of this individual was evident.</p><p>Cornered at a cliff face, the rabbit spirit, knowing its fate, glared fiercely.  Blowing a foul wind from its mouth, its teeth turned crimson, and it lunged.</p><p>The Ghost-folk, instead of fearing, let out a joyful cry. Without dodging, it unleashed a powerful punch, landing a decisive blow on the rabbit's throat.</p><p>A sickening crack of bone followed. The rabbit spirit screamed in agony, its survival instinct kicking in, attempting to flee.  But the Ghost-folk seized its neck, crushing it until it was still.</p><p>Blood gushed from the wound.  The Ghost-folk lifted the corpse, drank its blood, and then dragged it towards a hidden valley.  Inside was a cave sealed with massive stones. The Ghost-folk knocked, the stones rolled open, and it entered, resealing the entrance with a resounding thud.</p><p>Qin Sang observed everything.  Generations of Ghost-folk living here, battling spirits and monsters, had undergone a transformation.  Even upon returning to the Daoist Court, generations of gradual recovery would be needed to restore their normalcy.</p><p>In fact, the Daoist Court didn't reject the Ghost-folk; some even went out to find them and bring them back.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, had his own concerns.  Turning to the wolf spirit, he said, "Go. I'll handle this."</p><p>The wolf spirit was surprised.  Expecting some form of restraint, it was instead released so easily to lure the serpent spirit.  It checked itself for any unusual markings, found none, and bowing, leaped from the cliff, disappearing into the forest.</p><p>Unaware, a butterfly rested on its shoulder, its wings moving with its movements.  Qin Sang, however, was aware.  The butterfly's invisibility was innate, invisible even to most cultivators, and certainly undetectable by a mere shaped-shifting妖王.</p><p>Qin Sang followed leisurely, soon finding a cave, retrieving the Dao tree, and falling into contemplation.</p><p>The wolf spirit, still nervous, reached a dark pool.  It used a fang to draw three clockwise and three counter-clockwise circles in the water.  With a rush, water rose forming a seven-foot-long serpent, its eyes wary, sensing the wolf spirit's cultivation before stating coldly, "You failed!"</p>
