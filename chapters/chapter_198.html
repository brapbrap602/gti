**Chapter 191: Five Elements Strengthen the Foundation**

Enslavement is never everlasting. As long as there is intelligence and instinct, there are few who would willingly accept slavery.

It is said that high-grade magical treasures will produce artifact spirits, but the relationship between the artifact spirit and its owner is closer to that of a relative or a fellow Taoist, which is fundamentally different from slavery.

Once the enslaved party acquires the ability to break free from their bonds, they will not hesitate to retaliate against their master.

The same applies to living corpses refined using the **Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture**.

According to the secret method, it is best for corpse refiners to refine living corpses using cultivators of the same realm. For example, a cultivator in the early Congealing Essence Plane who creates a living corpse from a cultivator in the mid-Congealing Essence Plane must be very cautious when manipulating the living corpse in battle.

The gap between one level is not very large, and if nothing unexpected happens, it is still possible to suppress the living corpse. However, if a living corpse is created from a cultivator in the later stage of the Congealing Essence Plane, the corpse refiner should not even think about controlling it, as they will definitely be retaliated against. Instead, they should think about saving themselves first.

With the Jade Buddha's help, I should be able to break through this limitation, Qin Sang thought to himself.

However, refining a living corpse is extremely difficult. Not only do you need to defeat your opponent first, but you also need to capture them alive and imprison their original spirit.

I can't even defeat cultivators in the mid-Congealing Essence Plane, and I have no elders to help, so how can I possibly refine a living corpse from a cultivator in the later stage of the Congealing Essence Plane?

At this thought, Qin Sang shook his head and cast these useless thoughts aside. He fixed his gaze on "White Cloud Mountain Man" and recalled the secret method of the **Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture**.

After being refined into a zombie, two more steps would be required. The first step would be to use the five elemental Yin objects to lay the foundation, and the next step would be to draw the Earth Magnate Chi into their body, eventually transforming "White Cloud Mountain Man" completely into a Bloodfiend Corpse.

Ordinary corpse refining methods did not require this step. As long as the cultivator's Dantian had not been damaged before death, they could absorb Yin Magnate Chi into their body and into their Dantian, forming a sea of Yin Chi, and thus could transform into a Bloodfiend Corpse.

If the Dantian of a corpse was destroyed, it could also be transformed into a Bloodfiend Corpse by placing it in an area with extremely strong Yin Chi and nourishing the corpse over a long period of time. However, the corpse would certainly be useless for refining.

Earth Magnate Chi was more violent than Yin Chi, which was why the five elemental Yin objects were needed to help stabilize the Dantian and prevent the Bloodfiend Corpse from being destroyed.

Moreover, the five elemental Yin objects were also crucial for condensing Earth Magnate Chi. The five elemental Yin objects would act as guides, allowing the secret method ban from the **Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture** and "White Cloud Mountain Man" to fuse together, and only then would they be able to suppress the Earth Magnate Chi.

White Cloud Mountain Man had cultivated a Wood Element technique before his death. Qin Sang's eyes darted around and he spotted the Moon Locus Wood core in front of him, and he summoned it into his palm.

The wood core was snow-white and emitted a peaceful aura. It was the精华精华, essence, of this 600-year-old Moon Locus Wood.

He used his spiritual energy to create a knife and carefully cut a piece off the Moon Locus Wood core. He then suspended it in front of him and cast secret method bans on it.

Soon after, the piece of wood core began to melt like ice, and finally, the Moon Locus Wood core was refined until it was extremely pure, leaving only a small ball of liquid-like substance.

"Go!"

Qin Sang aimed at "White Cloud Mountain Man"'s Dantian, flicked his finger, and the Moon Locus Wood core shot into "White Cloud Mountain Man"'s Dantian. "White Cloud Mountain Man"'s aura fluctuated.

Under Qin Sang's control, the power of the Moon Locus Wood core immediately spread throughout "White Cloud Mountain Man"'s Dantian, nourishing the withered Dantian. It seemed as if the exhausted sea of Qi was gradually coming back to life.

Qin Sang continued without stopping. In accordance with the sequence of the five elements producing each other, he summoned an Evil Griffon Feather. He used his spiritual energy to wrap around the Evil Griffon Feather and carefully extracted the ball of Yin Fire in the middle of the feather.

As the Yin Fire was forcefully extracted, the Evil Griffon Feather split into pieces and this precious spiritual material was thus destroyed. However, Qin Sang did not even glance at it, his gaze intently fixed on the ball of Yin Fire as he continued to refine it with secret method bans.

Next was the Nine Orifice Stone, the Blue Nether Gold, and finally the Yin Spirit Water.

He successively injected these five elemental Yin objects into "White Cloud Mountain Man"'s body, and the essence of the five elemental Yin objects fused together within him. His Dantian became extremely stable and full of bans.

Next came the most important part!

Qin Sang let out a long breath, adjusted his state, and picked up a Shaoyin Magnetic Bottle.

He opened the bottle's lid and a chill immediately spread out. Qin Sang carefully grabbed a wisp of Earth Magnate Chi, ignoring the bone-chilling cold. He used all his strength to suppress this wisp of Earth Magnate Chi. When it became docile, he slowly guided it into "White Cloud Mountain Man"'s Dantian.

'Boom!'

As the evil earth energy entered his body, 'White Cloud Hermit's' dantian felt like a pot about to explode, suddenly causing a huge commotion!

'White Cloud Hermit's' body was suddenly pulled by the energy, and he shivered violently. Qin Sang was distracted as he steadied 'White Cloud Hermit's' physical body; he didn't dare hesitate and hurriedly activated the restriction he'd left in his dantian with all his might, refining this wisp of evil earth energy.

'Puff!'

A black energy emerged from 'White Cloud Hermit's' dantian, a strong disturbance accompanying it, as if it were about to explode.

Qin Sang's expression was slightly solemn as he waved a surge of spiritual energy, silently annihilating the black energy.

As expected, it failed the first time, but that was within reason, and Qin Sang wasn't discouraged; he rested for a little while and then grabbed another wisp of evil earth energy.

He failed time and again until half the bottle of evil earth energy had been used up, and Qin Sang's expression changed slightly; a hint of joy emerged on his face, his divine sense clearly perceiving a black energy swimming around like a fish in 'White Cloud Hermit's' dantian as he finally subdued the first wisp of evil earth energy!

The hardest part was the start, and everything after was easy; his success rate increased. When he'd refined the zombie corpse, they hadn't even used up a bottle of evil earth energy.

Qin Sang heaved a sigh of relief and waved his hand, withdrawing all the spiritual things into his mustard seed bag; he looked at 'White Cloud Hermit' filled with joy.

Compared to when it was a zombie, 'White Cloud Hermit' hadn't changed much, apart from the faint black energy circling his skin.

He still wasn't truly a zombie corpse; it would take some time for the evil earth energy to enter his whole body, tempering his body and improving its strength with the restriction's help.

Once 'White Cloud Hermit' had melded with the evil earth energy and they became one, his whole body filled with the black energy and transformed into a zombie corpse like a demon, his strength would reach its peak!

Qin Sang didn't need to worry about this process; he put it into the Corpse Puppet Bag to transform on its own, which wouldn't take long.

'Bang!'

The zombie corpse vanished from its spot and reappeared in front of Qin Sang; it threw a heavy punch, which he easily caught with his fist, experiencing the zombie corpse's power.

After all, it had just been refined; its speed and strength were slightly weaker than a Qi Refining Stage 13th Layer cultivator. It would definitely win after it had finished transforming.

Qin Sang then ran some experiments.

The zombie corpse could move freely and multitask; if it was controlled skillfully, there was a lot of potential.

But the defects were obvious too. After Qin Sang left the cave abode, he discovered that if the zombie corpse got too far away from him, the connection of the Spiritual Brand would severely weaken; he wouldn't be able to control the zombie corpse or perceive it, and it could only act on its own.

This shattered his plan of using the zombie corpse to scout dangerous places.
