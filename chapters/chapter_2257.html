<h1>Chapter 2247: The Theory of Regulating the Four Qi</h1><p>Tianjing Gate.</p><p>Master Chen's brow was furrowed.  There was still no news of Chen Yuze.  He, as the sect leader, issued an order: if the perpetrators wanted ransom, it was time to show themselves.  Any further delay risked escalating the situation and backfiring.</p><p>Furthermore, since their last meeting, the female demon had vanished without a trace.  All attempts to contact her had failed.</p><p>Having received no word from the female demon, he visited the mine again, discovering she hadn't returned since her departure.  Had something happened to her, or had he misjudged the situation, with these Golden Sparrows being the true culprits?</p><p>Besides the female demon, Master Chen had other ways to contact her clan leader, but he hesitated.  Firstly, for secrecy, these contact methods were extremely complex and cumbersome, requiring much effort unless he went to meet them personally. Secondly, he had to consider what to do if Yuze had indeed been abducted by the demon, used as leverage, forced to serve them, or even compelled to completely side with the demon race.</p><p>The war hadn't begun yet. Unless the annihilation of humanity was a certainty, siding with the demons was unwise. Hedging bets was acceptable, but before the outcome was decided, Master Chen didn't want to cut off his and his sect's escape routes!</p><p>Refusal might mean Yuze's death.  Yuze was his only son.  However, he was still in his prime, not nearing the end of his life and urgently needing to carry on the family line.</p><p>Master Chen's thoughts raced, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang had already journeyed deep into the wasteland aboard his flying vessel. His plan had worked; Master Chen had been successfully misled, not only suspecting the Source Purity Mountain, but also, due to suspicion, failing to timely contact the female demon's clan leader.</p><p>The vessel descended slowly.  Qin Sang disembarked, finding it had landed at a temporary base, resembling a fortress, perched atop the highest peak within thousands of miles, offering an unobstructed view of the surroundings.</p><p>After some discreet inquiry, Qin Sang grasped the local situation.  To the east lay a demon encampment, facing a human settlement in a tense standoff. Years of skirmishes and conflict had bred deep resentment, creating a more volatile atmosphere than elsewhere.</p><p>He declined others' offers of cooperation, leaped from the mountain, flew for a while, and approached demon-controlled territory. Qin Sang landed his glow, and when he emerged from the woods, he had transformed, a pair of wings sprouting from his back.</p><p>The Heavenly Demon Transformation couldn't fully change Qin Sang into a true Azure Luan, only achieving a semi-demon form.  Unlike later generations who prized human form, many demons in this era, upon gaining the ability to shapeshift, still chose human form.  However, they didn't use the term 'human form,' instead claiming they were imitating and following the divine.</p><p>Legend had it that whenever divine beings appeared before mortals, they were always in human form!</p><p>The authentic Azure Luan wings, coupled with the Azure Luan dharma image, provided him with an extremely pure Azure Luan aura.  With caution, Qin Sang could easily pass as genuine.</p><p>This disguise wasn't flawless, however, and Qin Sang dared not be reckless, needing to tread carefully and avoid contact with top-tier demon powerhouses.</p><p>As Qin Sang flew out of the woods, sounds of wind reached his ears.  Moments later, several bird-like demons, resembling crows but with long tail feathers, approached. They wore uniform armor, clearly patrol units.  Upon seeing Qin Sang's beckoning gesture, they tensed, quickly approached, and bowed, chorusing, "Greetings, senior!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, his expression haughty.  "I've just arrived and am unfamiliar with the terrain.  I almost wandered into human territory. Since you're patrolling here, I presume your camp is nearby?"</p><p>A demon bird nodded repeatedly.  "Senior, you were simply off course. Our camp is just over there. I happen to have a map; please accept it, senior."</p><p>It respectfully presented a jade slip. Qin Sang received it, nodded slightly, and looked intently at the bird. "You're quite perceptive."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang left.  After he'd gone, a demon bird grumbled, "That senior was stingy. He took the captain's map without offering any reward."</p><p>"Shut up!"</p><p>The captain glared.  "That senior is incredibly powerful, likely a top expert sent from above to oversee this place!  This is a fortunate encounter.  We might get more benefits later. Perhaps we'll be transferred back soon."</p><p>...</p><p>A small test of his abilities had proven successful, and no suspicion had been aroused.</p><p>Qin Sang, unaware of the minor demons' plans, consulted the jade slip's annotations, finally settling on an inconspicuous mountain range.</p><p>"Yunxiu Mountain..."</p><p>Through soul-searching a female demon, Qin Sang learned that her clan leader had established a cave dwelling in a place called Yunxiu Mountain as a base.</p><p>"I wonder if this demon is still there?"</p><p>Qin Sang noted that Yunxiu Mountain was a considerable distance northeast of the demon encampment. The farther the better; acting would be easier.  Ambushing powerful demons in their territory required caution.</p><p>Instead of going directly to the demon camp, he first went to Yunxiu Mountain for a secret reconnaissance, then began to subtly contact demon cultivators.</p><p>Soon, nearby demon cultivators knew that a powerful Qingluan cultivator had arrived. However, this Qingluan cultivator was very mysterious and elusive, and nobody knew what he was doing. Even famous experts found it difficult to meet him unless he appeared himself; no one knew his whereabouts.</p><p>Some demon cultivators speculated that this Qingluan expert might have an important mission, searching for a location or helpers.</p><p>The demon cultivators active in this area were either similar to the Jinying clan, subordinate to the Feng clan, or like the Yanjinque, a branch with mixed bloodlines.  Being connected to the Qingluan clan was the dream of countless demon cultivators.</p><p>Therefore, after a while, many demon cultivators began to seek out Qin Sang, hoping to gain his favor.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang did many things to enhance his reputation, yet rarely appeared publicly, becoming increasingly mysterious in the eyes of the demons.</p><p>"The time is right..."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards Yunxiu Mountain.</p><p>He was fairly certain that the female demon's clan leader was currently in the mountains! This demon was likely waiting for news from the female demon, rarely leaving her cave dwelling, and had many powerful clan members with her. Capturing her wouldn't be easy.</p><p>All of Qin Sang's seemingly useless actions were paving the way for this day.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>Qin Sang thrust a triangular magic banner into the ground.  Beneath was not solid earth, but a large expanse of mud, bubbling and emitting a foul odor.</p><p>Miasma filled the air, poisonous, though the toxins were relatively mild.</p><p>The triangular banner sank to its base in the swamp, emitting no aura.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction, his figure flickering and disappearing.</p><p>...</p><p>Yunxiu Mountain.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A Yanjinque flew into the mountains, rushing to a stone mansion, activating the restriction. "Junior Jin Yan requests an audience with the clan leader."</p><p>It waited a moment before the stone gate opened automatically, a deep voice emanating from within.  "Enter!"</p><p>"Clan leader!"</p><p>Jin Yan entered the cave dwelling, prostrating himself before a huge Yanjinque.</p><p>This Yanjinque was their clan leader, Jin Xiao.</p><p>Jin Yan, knowing the clan leader's temperament, immediately produced a pouch and explained his purpose. "Clan leader, I was tasked with retrieving the Sky-Linen Stone, and along the way, I encountered a Qingluan senior..."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Clan leader Jin Xiao was startled. "Are you sure it was a Qingluan?"</p><p>"I'm almost certain. During the clan leader's seclusion, this news has spread everywhere..."</p><p>Jin Yan recounted the recent events.</p><p>Clan leader Jin Xiao's eyes narrowed. "Continue. What did he do to you?"</p><p>"The senior gave me a bag of Yuewu tree seeds, instructing me to plant them somewhere and warning me not to tell anyone. Then he left.  I found it strange, so I ask for the clan leader's judgment," Jin Yan presented the pouch.</p><p>"These are indeed Yuewu tree seeds," Clan leader Jin Xiao nodded after examining them, coldly sneering. "He wasn't warning you, he was warning me!"</p><p>Jin Yan gasped, not understanding.</p><p>"Yuewu tree seeds aren't rare, but they're difficult to cultivate. With your cultivation, even planting one successfully is lucky without help. Giving you so many seeds, he clearly anticipated you reporting to me and wanted to use us!"</p><p>Jin Xiao didn't say another word.</p><p>These spirit trees are difficult to cultivate and grow slowly, but they have a very special effect—they are rare and innately compatible with the Phoenix bloodline.</p><p>The Feng clan deploying an army and setting up a camp; one method is to pre-plant Yuewu trees.</p><p>It's said that Yuewu tree encampments have countless benefits, but they must be mature trees.  催熟 these trees requires not only secret techniques but also an extremely high cost, something that isn't readily used.</p><p>"The Qingluan clan wants to plant a Yuewu forest here.  Have they decided to fight the human race?"</p><p>Jin Xiao was suspicious. "Did he offer you any reward?"</p><p>"No," Jin Yan shook his head.  "Clan leader, should we still do it?"</p><p>"Do it! Why not?"</p><p>Jin Xiao made an immediate decision.</p><p>It was only planting Yuewu trees, not sending them to their deaths. Even if the other party was a deceiver, they wouldn't be cheated out of anything.</p><p>If they could achieve a great feat before the war and curry favor with a powerful Azure Bird Clan expert, they would have the confidence to refuse dangerous missions during the actual war. Why not?</p><p>"Where did he tell you to plant the trees?"</p><p>Jin Yan pointed north. "In that poisonous swamp, and you must plant the entire swamp."</p><p>"Why there?"</p><p>Clan Chief Jin Xiao secretly wondered. The terrain there was unremarkable, and the environment wasn't suitable for Moon Willow trees, though the environment could be altered.</p><p>He understood why the other party had approached them—because the Yunxiu Gold Mountain was closest to the swamp, and the Yanjin Que were the largest force nearby.  Proximity was key.</p><p>"Go wake up the two elders... No, I'll go with you!"</p><p>Clan Chief Jin Xiao lightly vibrated his wings, the tremor spreading, waking the clan elders in the nearby caves.</p><p>After a brief discussion, they set off with some of the clan's younger members, flying towards the swamp in a large group.</p><p>Near the swamp, Qin Sang was lying in wait, observing the Yunxiu Gold Mountain.</p><p>Seeing the approaching group of demons from afar, Qin Sang's gaze shifted, immediately locking onto the largest Yanjin Que.</p><p>"Huh? They actually brought the main target out directly."</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly pleased.</p><p>This time, instead of silently waiting, he took the initiative, luring out his target. He'd made several preparations, originally planning to gradually lead the opponent into a trap; planting the trees was only the first step.  Unexpectedly, it had been so smooth, the first step succeeded immediately.</p><p>He seemed to have underestimated the Azure Bird Clan's status in the hearts of these demons, Qin Sang mused.</p><p>"Clan Chief, we've reached the swamp."</p><p>Under Clan Chief Jin Xiao's orders, the clan elders each led a team of juniors to investigate, finding nothing unusual.</p><p>"Plant the trees!"</p><p>Clan Chief Jin Xiao commanded, "Remember, plant these trees with all your might, and let's see what that person intends to do next!"</p><p>Having said that, Clan Chief Jin Xiao flapped his wings and turned to return to the cave.</p><p>Suddenly, the swamp's mud boiled and surged violently, countless green lights shooting up from the ground.</p><p>Before the demons could react, thousands of green lights soared into the sky, crisscrossing to form a massive palace.</p><p>Including Clan Chief Jin Xiao, all the clan members in the swamp were drawn into the palace.</p><p>With a 'boom,' the entire swamp trembled, and the palace sank, taking the Yanjin Que within with it, into the earth. Qin Sang disappeared as well.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>A figure burst from the swamp, shooting towards the sky.</p><p>Only in the evening did the Yanjin Que remaining in the mountains notice something amiss. Upon reaching the swamp, they found it empty, falling into terror.</p><p>...</p><p>"Since you remain obstinate, don't blame me for being ruthless! I apologize for this!"</p><p>Qin Sang's carefully laid plan successfully crippled Clan Chief Jin Xiao's forces and severely wounded him, capturing him alive. Unfortunately, his mouth was tighter than a female demon's, and Qin Sang's interrogation yielded nothing, leaving him with only soul-searching as an option.</p><p>For this, Qin Sang specially set up a spirit array to complement the soul-searching technique.  However, after the soul-searching, he couldn't help but show regret.</p><p>The difference in cultivation between them was significant, greatly affecting the effectiveness of the soul-searching.  Soul-searching a stronger person was inherently difficult, and the spirit array couldn't fully compensate. If Qin Sang hadn't been so experienced, it would have ended in failure.</p><p>The soul-searching revealed some information, but not all. Qin Sang now had to make a personal trip to fill in the missing pieces.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang reached out, seizing Clan Chief Jin Xiao's pouch-like storage device, breaking the seal, and taking out an item.</p><p>This item was a jade tablet, identical to the one containing the "Water and Fire Harmony" chapter, except this one had a corner missing.</p><p>"The 'Theory of Regulating the Spirit through the Four Seasons'!"</p><p>As his consciousness sank into it, countless characters flooded his mind, and Qin Sang muttered the chapter's name.</p><p>As the name suggests, the four qi  were related to the weather—spring, summer, autumn, winter; warm, hot, cool, cold; belonging to yin and yang.</p><p>The "Theory of Regulating the Spirit through the Four Seasons" believed that living beings and the qi of Heaven and Earth corresponded. One should follow the qi of the four seasons to regulate the spleen, the mind and spirit!</p><p>This was clearly another secret manual on the Yin-Yang Dao, deeply connected to the "Grand Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang".</p><p>Cultivating this technique wouldn't yield immediate results, but persistent practice would subtly harmonize one's being, improve one's innate abilities, and even bring unexpected benefits.</p><p>Clan Chief Jin Xiao had been cultivating this technique.  His last breakthrough had been unusually smooth, earning him the old clan chief's approval and his succession to the position.</p>
