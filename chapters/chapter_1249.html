<h1>Chapter 1241: Thousand Bodies and Myriad Shadows</h1><p>The Blood-Boiling Demonic Flower was a rare bloom of the demonic path, but it offered no assistance in forming a Nascent Soul. If there truly were Blood Ganoderma, Dongyang Bo could have simply harvested it, refined it into a pill, and used it to help his disciples form their Nascent Souls. Why go through all this trouble to seize a Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman? </p><p>Dongyang Bo sighed inwardly, unable to help but admire the methods of Elder Chongyi and the Red-Haired Patriarch in nurturing their disciples. After the death of the Red-Haired Patriarch, the Pure Yang Sect had disintegrated, but the two Nascent Soul cultivators of the Taiyi Alchemy Sect had trained together since childhood, their bond unbreakable. They would not repeat the same mistakes. </p><p>It was a matter of timing, geography, and human harmony—the Taiyi Alchemy Sect was destined to rise! Elder Chongyi could now rest in peace.</p><p>In this era, reaching the Divine Transformation stage was a distant dream, and the path to immortality was but a fleeting illusion. For countless years, not a single case had emerged; it existed only in legends. Cultivators were well aware that the path to immortality had been severed, and eternal life was nothing more than a beautiful aspiration. Returning to reality, cultivators merely lived a few more years than mortals. </p><p>Mortals were like morning mushrooms, unaware of the passing of days and nights. Cultivators were like summer cicadas, their cries lasting only until autumn. In such circumstances, unless one truly embraced a life of pure inaction, who wouldn’t want to leave some mark in the world, proof that they had once walked this earth? </p><p>For mortals, their lifelong pursuits were nothing more than fame, fortune, and leaving their names in the annals of history. For cultivators, what they sought was the continuation of their lineage, ensuring that their legacy would endure. Moreover, Dongyang Bo had sworn before his master’s coffin to revitalize Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Experiencing the soul shadows within the Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman and sensing the realm of the Nascent Soul was a lengthy process. Even for those with exceptional talent, it would take at least forty-nine days. However, the Green Spirit Qi within the Spirit-Calming Jade was limited and would be destroyed after a single use, unable to sustain such a long period. </p><p>Having obtained the Spirit-Calming Jade, Gongliang Yu could only use it to drive the Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman in search of treasures. When the Blood Lake opened, Dongyang Bo knew his opportunity had arrived. The Blood Lake was the most dangerous forbidden ground within the Boundless Valley, where even Nascent Soul cultivators could not guarantee their safety. </p><p>If it were someone like Iron-Crowned Daoist, who was honest and cautious, they might hesitate, fearing the loss of a sect treasure and the potential for disaster. But Gongliang Yu had always been arrogant. Entering the Blood Lake to search for herbs, he would undoubtedly carry the Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman with him. </p><p>This way, Dongyang Bo could seize Gongliang Yu and the Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman without anyone noticing. In the chaos that followed, it might even be possible to annex the Upper Pure Palace. It was also a result of Iron-Crowned Daoist’s misjudgment, sowing the seeds of this calamity. Of course, it was hard to say whether Dongyang Bo had played a role in fanning the flames.</p><p>...</p><p>Gongliang Yu was a clever man. With just a few words, he had pieced together most of Dongyang Bo’s scheme. Their conversation took place through divine sense, lasting only an instant. Realizing Dongyang Bo’s intentions, Gongliang Yu was filled with dread. </p><p>If Dongyang Bo had come for the Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman and had set a trap here in advance, waiting for him to walk into it, how could he not have countermeasures prepared? </p><p>Just as the Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman, summoned by Gongliang Yu, was about to leave the side of the Blood Ganoderma, a surge of blood mist erupted from beneath the herb, and beams of mysterious light shot out. The illusion of the Blood Ganoderma shattered completely. </p><p>This illusion had been set up by Dongyang Bo using a treasure as bait. It was not without flaws, nor was the concealment particularly sophisticated. But Gongliang Yu’s cultivation was inferior to his, and with countless blood shadows around and the Green Spirit Qi’s limited duration, Gongliang Yu had no time to investigate carefully. Dongyang Bo had lured him here after careful consideration.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The eerie wind grew fiercer. From within the blood mist, ten thousand beams of light suddenly shot out, followed by the appearance of a vortex. The shadow of a grand formation emerged from below, and at its center was a jade bottle, its mouth facing the puppet talisman, emitting a continuous suction force. </p><p>Under the pull of the jade bottle, the Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman’s speed drastically decreased, as if trapped in quicksand, unable to move an inch. The puppet roared. As a demonic puppet, its body was infused with countless soul shadows, making it extremely violent by nature. It would not submit to being restrained. Instantly, its entire body glowed, and countless talisman shadows erupted. </p><p>Mountains, rocks, water, fire, thunder, and ancient trees—various attack scenes dazzled the eyes, bursting forth from the Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman like fireworks, striking the grand formation. Gongliang Yu grew anxious, urging the puppet repeatedly. </p><p>The Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman’s attacks caused the jade bottle to tremble and the grand formation to shake, but the suction force remained relentless. For a time, the puppet could not break free. To make matters worse, Dongyang Bo formed a hand seal, and the Diamond Ring above his head emitted a metallic clang, releasing a shadow of the ring that solidified and descended upon the Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>As the ring’s shadow contracted, the binding force pressed down on the puppet, causing its body to creak. Though its physical form was tough and it felt no pain, it could sense that the other party intended to capture it. Enraged, it roared repeatedly, its counterattacks growing even more frenzied. </p><p>Unfortunately, Dongyang Bo had planned this for a long time, specifically choosing a formation that countered the Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman. It would not be so easily broken free. Most of the spiritual talisman power unleashed by the puppet was swallowed by the jade bottle, which continued to tremble, though it was unclear when it might burst.</p><p>Seeing this, Gongliang Yu felt a bitter taste in his mouth. He knew the situation was hopeless. There was no way he could reclaim the Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman now. The sect’s treasure, passed down through generations, would be lost under his watch. His only option now was to save his own life. </p><p>Dongyang Bo had chosen this place to act, clearly intending to eliminate him as well, to cut off all future troubles. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, Gongliang Yu saw the cold glint in Dongyang Bo’s eyes, his killing intent surging. </p><p>Gongliang Yu dared not hope that Dongyang Bo would spare him. He was a decisive man, and seeing that the situation was beyond saving, he steeled his heart and without hesitation detonated his Heavenly Blade Talisman! </p><p>The explosion of the secret talisman forced the nearby blood shadows to retreat, barely opening a path. Gongliang Yu’s body was enveloped by the roar of a dragon shadow as he poured all his strength into activating the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman. At the same time, he summoned a sect treasure specifically designed to enhance his speed. His speed was astonishing, comparable to that of an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator. </p><p>Unfortunately, in Dongyang Bo’s eyes, it was still not enough. </p><p>The moment he moved, before he could escape far, a blinding white light filled his vision. A terrifying binding force descended from above, and even the blood in his body seemed to stop flowing. Only then did he realize the vast gap between himself and a mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator. </p><p>Gongliang Yu exhausted all his means, but every technique was effortlessly neutralized by the Diamond Ring. </p><p>At that moment, he suddenly struck his own chest with his hand. A golden light burst forth from his palm—it was a golden spiritual talisman. </p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Gongliang Yu’s body shattered instantly, transforming into countless golden streams of light. The faint sound of Buddhist chants echoed as even the Diamond Ring could not restrain them. The golden lights scattered in all directions. </p><p>This was Gongliang Yu’s ultimate escape technique. </p><p>Faced with this sudden turn of events, Dongyang Bo not only remained calm but sneered, “The Thousand Bodies and Myriad Shadows Talisman of the Upper Pure Palace—truly a top-tier life-saving divine ability. In any other place, even I might not be able to stop you. Unfortunately, this talisman originates from the Buddhist path, and in this place of yin and filth, it is precisely countered.”</p><p>Before his words faded, the yin energy surged, and countless blood shadows suddenly lunged at the golden lights like ravenous beasts, devouring them completely. </p><p>The Thousand Bodies and Myriad Shadows Talisman shattered. </p><p>Gongliang Yu tumbled out, his face pale. </p><p>The Thousand Bodies and Myriad Shadows Talisman was extremely difficult to suppress. Dongyang Bo had lured Gongliang Yu to this place precisely because he feared this talisman and worried that Gongliang Yu might escape. </p><p>Now that the talisman had been broken, Dongyang Bo leisurely pointed at Gongliang Yu.</p>
