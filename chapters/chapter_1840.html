<h1>Chapter 1831: Return to the Pagoda</h1><p>Sword Heart Isle.</p><p>Sword energy surged.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Sword Master sat in the courtyard, holding cups, observing two sword leaves intertwining.</p><p>Sword energy emanated from the leaves.</p><p>They used the leaves as swords, practicing their swordsmanship.</p><p>After a stick of incense, the two leaf-swords separated with a clear ringing sound that echoed across Sword Heart Isle.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The Sword Master, just about to drink his wine, paused slightly, his gaze falling on Qin Sang.  "Brother, it's been many years. Your swordsmanship has become even more refined; it's almost undergone a transformation."</p><p>Qin Sang sipped his wine and nodded with a smile.</p><p>The *Yuan Shen Sword Cultivation Chapter* and the Chengying Sword inheritance complemented each other. Qin Sang's improvement in cultivation naturally enhanced his swordsmanship.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't complacent. He clearly felt that the Sword Master had been effortlessly superior during their practice.</p><p>“I wonder if, once my cultivation reaches his level, I can force him to use eight-tenths of his strength…”</p><p>Qin Sang considered himself to have exceptional cultivation speed thanks to the *Poison God Scripture*, catching up to the Sword Master shouldn't be difficult, but he had less confidence in his swordsmanship.</p><p>This exchange was also a form of instruction.</p><p>The stronger Qin Sang became, the more he appreciated the Sword Master's profound mastery of the sword, silently marveling within.</p><p>“I eagerly await the day your swordsmanship reaches its peak, Brother, so we can have a truly exhilarating battle!” The Sword Master laughed heartily, finishing his wine and pointing at his leaf-sword.</p><p>Instantly, the night sky rustled.</p><p>Sword light flashed like lightning, the sword's momentum shifting dramatically, like a violent storm, leaving one breathless.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's sword was shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled wryly and conceded defeat.</p><p>The sword light vanished.</p><p>A leaf fell softly to the ground, making it hard to believe that such fierce swordsmanship had been wielded with it.</p><p>The Sword Master rose, gazing at the heavens.</p><p>The moon hung high, its light like water.</p><p>He seemed to be admiring the moon, yet also looking into the depths of the night sky, murmuring, “Swordsmanship prioritizes the heart of the sword. Do you possess it, Brother?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, closing his eyes and falling into deep thought.</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, the Sword Master's heart was entirely devoted to the sword, seeking nothing else.</p><p>He, on the other hand, was quite the opposite. His studies were incredibly diverse, unlike anyone else in the world.  Anything that could improve him and bring him closer to immortality, whether righteous, evil, demonic, or other, was treated equally, learned, and utilized.</p><p>A chaotic path also has its merits.</p><p>Qin Sang's achievements to this day relied on the jade Buddha, avoiding the shortcomings of various techniques, not adhering to any single method.</p><p>The combination of different techniques sometimes produced unpredictable and wonderful results.</p><p>In combat, Qin Sang held a significant advantage; his opponents were often counteracted by him in some way.  No matter the danger, he could always find a solution.</p><p>But with his current strength, facing the Sword Master, he didn't feel confident of victory!</p><p>To achieve the state of sword heart that the Sword Master spoke of, did he need to focus solely on the sword like the other man?</p><p>“Cultivating swords with techniques, inheriting the Chengying sword technique... perhaps swordsmanship is my best path.  But can I truly abandon the unorthodox ways?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, “Was the Sword Master’s statement advising me to return to the righteous path, or warning me not to be obsessed with swordsmanship?”</p><p>The moon moved westward.</p><p>When Qin Sang came to his senses, the Sword Master was gone, leaving only leftover food, a cool night breeze…</p><p>And the leaves in the courtyard.</p><p>…</p><p>As Qin Sang flew away from Sword Heart Isle, he continued to ponder.</p><p>Leaving Star Island Lake, he headed southeast towards Jingtai Temple. The time of their agreement was approaching; it was time to ascend the pagoda again!</p><p>On a perilous mountain peak, Qin Sang stood atop, overlooking the mountain road below.</p><p>As night fell, the road was still bustling with people, some even lighting torches to travel at night.</p><p>Most were heading east; few were going in the opposite direction.</p><p>He wasn’t far from Jingtai Temple, at the border between the human territory of Ju Mountain and the demon kingdom.</p><p>These commoners were actively moving to the demon kingdom.</p><p>In the past, commoners in the demon kingdom were treated as beasts of burden, food for demons, slaughtered at will, suffering greatly. Countless people desperately fled, seeking refuge in their own clans and sects.</p><p>Now, the situation was reversed.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't sense any demon cultivators nearby, and there was no one driving people away from the road. These people were voluntarily going to the demon kingdom.</p><p>Qin Sang paused for a moment, changed direction, following the flow of people into the demon kingdom's territory. After investigation, he confirmed his suspicions.</p><p>The demons were promoting the Demon God way.</p><p>The primary focus of the Demon God was gathering followers; the more, the better, to ensure continuous offerings, changing their former practice of harming commoners.</p><p>Rumors spread to the human realm.</p><p>Although humans weren’t killed in the human territories, life was still difficult, and wealth was rare.</p><p>News spread that the deity not only cherished its followers but also granted their wishes and performed miracles periodically.  Devotees only needed to show sincere reverence.  Emboldened by this, some ventured across borders to investigate.  Confirming the truth, they excitedly told others, and it quickly became a widespread phenomenon.</p><p>The land of the deity flourished.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly left the deity's land, traveling directly back to Jingtai Temple without stopping.</p><p>Apparently, Venerable Zhenru had given instructions beforehand.  As soon as Qin Sang arrived at the temple gate, before even announcing his Dharma name, a surprised young monk opened the gate and respectfully welcomed him in.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru, who had been in seclusion, emerged immediately upon receiving the news.</p><p>Once inside the private chamber, after dismissing the attendants, Venerable Zhenru sighed, “Daoist Master, you’ve kept us waiting. Do you have a decision?”</p><p>“I have come regarding our agreement,” Qin Sang said calmly.  “This time, ascending the pagoda again, I should have a more than 70% chance of breaking the final seal!”</p><p>His voice was filled with confidence.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru was overjoyed but didn't immediately go to the pagoda. First, he produced several artifacts.</p><p>These were carefully collected by Jingtai Temple’s senior monks to help resist the dangers within the pagoda.</p><p>Qin Sang readily accepted several, refining them under Venerable Zhenru’s guidance.</p><p>After thorough preparation, the two entered the mountain ravine and arrived before the pagoda.</p><p>Having attempted the ascent many times decades ago, Qin Sang was intimately familiar with the pagoda, requiring no explanation.</p><p>They worked together seamlessly, swiftly ascending five levels to reach the sixth seal.</p><p>Thanks to the artifacts, they remained in excellent condition.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru raised his hand towards the seal, glanced at Qin Sang, and forcefully shattered it.</p><p>The moment the seal broke, Qin Sang burst into the sixth level like a whirlwind, encountering a familiar sight.</p><p>Eighteen bronze monks were bowing before the entrance.  Without hesitation, Qin Sang charged forward, striking out with his fist!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The force of the blow was like thunder.</p><p>The eighteen bronze monks remained impassive, forming a defensive array, their eighteen bronze staffs striking towards Qin Sang simultaneously.</p><p>*Swish swish swish…*</p><p>Numerous powerful gusts of wind converged into one.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this was one of the strongest formations of the bronze monk array.  Normally, they would have sought to exploit a weakness in the array and break it piecemeal, not engage in a direct confrontation.</p><p>However, this was precisely the most efficient method they had deduced.</p><p>*Rumble!*  A deafening sound erupted as fists and staffs collided. Qin Sang’s body trembled violently.</p><p>Time seemed to stand still.</p><p>Qin Sang’s fist withstood the eighteen staffs, then he grunted, his power surging wildly.  A faint golden light, unlike the usual glazed light, emanated from his body.</p><p>At that moment, his right fist seemed to swell, possessing the power to shatter any obstacle.</p><p>The eighteen bronze monks were equally unrelenting, their golden Buddha light connecting them as they roared in unison, their staffs pressing down forcefully.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A massive surge of power erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his fist and retreated several steps.  The bronze staffs were repelled, two bronze monks staggering. A barely perceptible hesitation appeared in their formation.</p><p>This hesitation provided an opening.</p><p>A jade-white giant hand suddenly appeared above one of the bronze monks, striking down without warning.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru had waited for this precise moment; the strike was exceptionally shrewd, leaving the other monks unable to intervene.</p><p>With a *crack*, the monk's head exploded, scattering golden dust as his body collapsed.</p><p>With one monk fallen, the formation’s weakness widened.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped retreating and counterattacked, rushing into the array like a tiger among sheep, moving with ghostlike speed.</p><p>The bronze monks attempted a hasty counterattack, but with Qin Sang and Venerable Zhenru coordinating their efforts, chaos ensued.</p><p>The Vajra Wheel Seal, including the Lotus Seal, was a powerful martial art; combined with his celestial eye ability, Qin Sang could see through the formations' changes.</p><p>Qin Sang moved as if unimpeded, delivering three swift punches.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Three monks were shattered.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru observed Qin Sang's power, his eyes gleaming.  He recognized Qin Sang using the Seven Masters Buddha Seal, noticing a difference from decades ago.</p><p>However, due to Qin Sang’s deliberate disguise, it would be difficult for others to guess that he had obtained the complete Vajra Wheel Seal, believing instead that he had merely improved his skills based on his previous insights.</p><p>Working together, Qin Sang and Venerable Zhenru quickly reduced the number of bronze monks to six.</p><p>Then, a scene that had previously forced them to retreat reappeared.</p><p>Bronze staffs clashed in the air, a golden sun manifesting as the monks merged into it, the golden light becoming intensely brilliant.</p><p>An unbearable heat engulfed them both.</p><p>Both felt parched and experienced the illusion of being melted by the sun.</p><p>Zenru, without hesitation, sat cross-legged, raising a hand to create a shimmering curtain of light.  The curtain transformed into a protective umbrella above his head, shielding him from the intense sun.  At the same time, various radiant lights flickered around Zenru.</p><p>Even with these protective treasures, Zenru could only barely defend himself.  He dared not be distracted, focusing all his energy on his protective techniques, placing all his hope in Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Zenru, then fixed his gaze on the blazing sun, before leaping forward, actively flying towards it.</p><p>Golden light shone everywhere.  In an instant, Qin Sang seemed to be forged of gold.  His back firm, he moved forward into the blinding light, his body seeming to melt into the sun. He closed his eyes slightly, feeling the intense pain and a terrifying power erupting from the sun.</p><p>There was no need to hide any longer.  Qin Sang fully unleashed the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, his body radiating a pure, glassy light; however, this light was completely swallowed by the golden radiance.</p><p>As he prepared to charge forward with the seal, a thought suddenly struck him. The moment he unleashed the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, the sun's heat seemed to lessen slightly.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, their golden light seeming to pierce through the sun, as he began to guess at the truth. The next moment, he didn't slow down but instead increased his speed, pushing the Great Vajra Wheel Seal to its limit.  He gathered the power of the seal into his right fist and struck the heart of the sun with a mighty blow!</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The Vajra Stupa trembled violently.  Where Qin Sang struck, at the center of the golden light, a black spot appeared. As the spot expanded, the sun shattered, golden light scattering in all directions, sweeping across the entire sixth level.</p><p>This punch seemed to break some barrier, and a sucking force erupted from the black spot. Qin Sang's body tensed, but he didn't struggle, letting the force pull him in.  Zenru, who had been struggling to hold on, was also enveloped by the suction, relieved at last.</p><p>After the two were gone, the sixth level quickly returned to normal.  The golden light re-formed eighteen bronze monks, who stood silently, waiting for the next challenger.</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>The sound of flowing water filled their ears. Qin Sang and Zenru entered a strange space, one after the other.  According to their deduction, this should be the seventh level of the Vajra Stupa.</p><p>The scene was completely unlike what they had imagined.  There was a great river, its waters surging. The sky was high and the clouds were light; the great river flowed, like the real world.  On the vast river, a monk stood on the water.  He appeared young and handsome, wearing simple monk's robes and straw sandals, possessing nothing else.</p><p>The monk stood with his hands at his sides, gazing in the direction of the flowing river, his eyes deep and unfathomable.  The moment Qin Sang and Zenru entered, the monk turned his head slightly and looked at them.</p><p>The instant they met the monk's gaze, their minds were shaken to their core.  The feeling was indescribable; they felt as if they were not facing a person, but mountains, rivers, or even the heavens themselves – how insignificant they were in his presence.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly recovered from his shock.  It was an illusion; the monk wasn't looking at them; his deep gaze seemed to see through the void behind them.</p><p>Then, the monk raised his right hand and formed a hand seal. His movements seemed slow but were swift, each motion like a brand, deeply imprinted on their minds.</p><p>Their minds were again profoundly shaken, entering a strange state from which they couldn't easily emerge.  The seal was etched into their hearts, the monk's movements endlessly repeating within their minds.</p><p>Then, they were jolted awake by a blinding golden light. A golden sun rose from above the monk's head, hanging high in the sky.  The sun's brilliance was boundless, its light capable of incinerating everything!</p><p>They were terrified, almost believing they were about to perish, before realizing it was an illusion, that the monk was merely a phantom.</p><p>"This seal… the eighth seal of the Nine Great Luminary Seals, the Sun Wheel Seal!"</p><p>A faint voice echoed in their ears.  Then the monk and the sun gradually faded, until both the monk and the great river dissolved into nothingness.</p><p>The illusion dissipated, and they found themselves in an empty room – the true seventh level of the pagoda. They gradually came to their senses, exchanging a look that held both self-deprecation and delight.</p><p>As expected, the Vajra Stupa was indeed a tower of Dharma transmission! The challenges of the lower six levels were all tests before the transmission.</p><p>Their self-deprecation stemmed from their own shortcomings.  Upon seeing the monk demonstrate the seal, they had an epiphany: the golden sun formed by the eighteen bronze monks was precisely the Sun Wheel Seal.  With sufficient insight, they could have bypassed the seventh level, gaining inspiration from the bronze monks to gradually understand the Sun Wheel Seal and thus obtain entry to the seventh level.</p><p>Clearly, neither they nor the great monks of Jingtai Temple throughout history had achieved this.  Their delight, of course, came from their newfound understanding.</p><p>Qin Sang was well aware of the power of the Nine Great Luminary Seals, and never expected to obtain another here. With the two seals resonating, the pressure he felt at the last moment weakened significantly.</p><p>Without speaking, the two eagerly sat down to cultivate and comprehend what they had learned.</p><p>(End)</p>
