<h1>Chapter 2062: Mist Beasts</h1><p>The Mist Sea has a unique celestial phenomenon. Whenever it arrives, a great fog, like a tidal wave, floods the world, blotting out the sky and sun, lingering for years. The Foreign Tribes call this the Mist Year.</p><p>The Mist Year is the most perilous time in the Mist Sea. During this period, not only does the frequency of Mistfalls greatly increase, but Mist Beasts also appear in droves, posing an immense threat to the denizens of the Mist Sea.</p><p>Therefore, the Foreign Tribes, when choosing their dwelling places, prioritize avoiding areas prone to Mistfalls and Mist Beast infestations.</p><p>The Foreign Tribes also have mortals, not everyone can cultivate.  The measure of their talent lies in the abundance of their ancestral heritage. Only those with sufficient talent can comprehend divine abilities and embark on the path of cultivation.</p><p>This step is called Awakening. The vast majority of the Foreign Tribes never Awaken. Some, though they might Awaken, do so too late, missing the optimal age, thus achieving little in their cultivation.</p><p>Over many years, the Foreign Tribes have developed a set of effective methods to cope with the Mist Year. They cultivate various crops that can be planted and harvested even during the Mist Year.  Mortals stockpile enough provisions for a year before the Mist Year arrives and don't venture far from their homes throughout its duration. Aside from some limitations on their daily lives and travel, they can generally weather it with composure.</p><p>When the Mist Year passes, the dense fog surrounding their settlements dissipates, the sun shines brightly upon the world, and life resumes as it does outside the Mist Sea.</p><p>Despite this, accidents are inevitable, such as sudden Mistfalls or rampaging Mist Beasts. Such events are like calamities.  If there are cultivators to protect them, it's fortunate; otherwise, it's a natural disaster.</p><p>During such times, the Foreign Tribes organize cultivators to patrol and, more often than not, receive warnings, allowing them to take precautions.</p><p>Compared to other places, the Mist Sea can be considered disaster-prone. But because of this, outsiders are mostly reluctant to enter, so the Foreign Tribes don't have to worry about invasion and can enjoy peace.</p><p>Gu Ya had also lived in the Mist Sea, but her understanding of it paled in comparison to Si Lu's.  Everyone listened to Si Lu's accounts of the Mist Sea and the Foreign Tribes with great fascination.</p><p>Gu Ya sighed, "Had I known this earlier, we wouldn't have lost so many comrades."</p><p>She now realized that there were many ways to forewarn of impending Mistfalls and Mist Beast attacks. Although not entirely accurate, these methods could greatly reduce the losses they caused.</p><p>The Storm Realm cultivators had also gradually deduced some patterns, but at a bloody price!</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Si Lu, will the Mist Year hinder our next move?"</p><p>Qin Sang and the others looked at Si Lu.</p><p>"Xia Changshi and I disappeared nearby. Those people haven't found us and likely haven't given up yet. They're probably still searching for me. However, during the Mist Year, due to their patrol duties, they have to withdraw most of their manpower, which is actually beneficial for us.  We might as well leave this sea region first and then consider our next steps…"</p><p>Si Lu glanced outside again. The mist flowed like water in the sky, transforming into all sorts of fantastical scenes.  Activating his spirit eyes, he saw hazy mountain shadows in the depths of the mist.  Sensing no Mist Beasts or Si You Tribe cultivators nearby, he asked Qin Sang to summon the flying boat. It carried them aloft and vanished into the mist.</p><p>Worried about Si You Tribe experts watching the area, they moved cautiously, concealing the aura of the flying boat, and flew unhurriedly under Si Lu's guidance.</p><p>The grand formation was located on an island.</p><p>Within the Mist Sea, there were no vast continents like those of the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p>The Si You Tribe's royal family resided on the largest island, which, to cultivators of the Small Thousand Worlds, seemed like a vast, boundless landmass.  The entire Si You Tribe territory expanded outward from this central island, with outer islands of varying sizes granted as fiefdoms to the various kings.</p><p>The Vassal Tribes subordinate to the Si You Tribe were situated around their territory.  Other regions followed a similar structure.</p><p>But this didn't mean that travel between these places was unimpeded. First, not all areas were safe havens. Second, even after the Mist Year, the fog wouldn't dissipate in some places.  There were extremely dangerous locations that even the experts of the Foreign Tribes avoided, forming natural barriers.</p><p>It wasn't uncommon for two tribes' territories to be adjacent yet never encounter each other.</p><p>The major noble tribes traveled using Grand Teleportation Formations.  Ordinarily, they could travel to the Si You Tribe's royal city and then teleport to the Zhu Yan Tribe.  But Si Lu feared his adversaries were watching that area and dared not approach the royal city.</p><p>And the Vassal Tribes under the Si You Tribe didn't have teleportation formations to other locations.</p><p>Therefore, to reach the Zhu Yan Tribe, they had to first travel out of the Si You Tribe's and their Vassal Tribes' territories, then cross the border, arrive at another Foreign Tribe's territory, and finally teleport from there to the Zhu Yan Tribe.</p><p>This journey was of unknown length, but the previous teleportation had already saved them a significant amount of time, making it still acceptable.</p><p>The flying boat sped across the sea.  Under Si Lu's guidance, they constantly changed directions. Detecting no aura of Si You Tribe experts, they gradually relaxed.</p><p>"It seems they've given up searching for you, Fellow Daoist," Su Nu said.</p><p>"Perhaps," Si Lu replied noncommittally.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang, who was piloting the flying boat, suddenly frowned, his gaze deepening.</p><p>"Are there enemies approaching?" Su Nu quickly asked, noticing the change in Qin Sang's expression.</p><p>Si Lu's expression also abruptly tightened.</p><p>Qin Sang had the highest cultivation level among them and the aid of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.  Neither Su Nu nor Si Lu had detected anything unusual.</p><p>Qin Sang stared ahead, his voice grave, "The Qi ahead is amiss. There seems to be an aura…"</p><p>He paused.</p><p>He vaguely sensed an aura in the distance that seemed threatening, but when he focused his senses, it felt strange, unlike a Si You Tribe expert.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's description, Si Lu immediately realized, "It could be a Mist Beast!"</p><p>"Mist Beast?" Qin Sang's expression turned serious.</p><p>Si Lu nodded. "I've heard of them before. The tribe has never expanded into this sea region because Mist Beasts frequently spawn here and are difficult to eradicate. I didn't expect there to be such a powerful Mist Beast that could threaten Fellow Daoist Qin. The rumors are indeed true."</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang said, "Let's go take a look!"</p><p>He also wanted to see what a Mist Beast looked like. Such a powerful one was rare.</p><p>The flying boat continued forward. Gradually, Si Lu and Su Nu also detected the aura.  Gu Ya and the others felt a pressure descend, making them tense.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang halted the flying boat. Everyone activated their spirit eyes and looked ahead.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the mist ahead was very thin. It wasn't that the mist had dissipated, but that it was being absorbed by a mass of white mist at the center.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>'Crash crash crash!'</p><p>A storm raged.</p><p>They saw, amidst the towering waves, an incredibly dense mass of white mist drifting on the sea surface, rapidly moving while continuously absorbing the surrounding mist.</p><p>Within the white mist, foggy waves churned, revealing glimpses of strange silhouettes, like monstrous beasts. Some were enormous, while others were the size of ordinary birds and beasts, sometimes surfacing, sometimes sinking into the depths of the mist.</p><p>They, like the mist, were pure white, as if their bodies were composed of it.</p><p>The largest among them was a gigantic serpent. When it occasionally raised its head, it resembled a large island; its arched back, a mountain range; its raised tail, a towering peak.</p><p>They only ever saw parts of the serpent's body, but it wasn't difficult to infer that it was at least ten thousand zhang long.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed its power briefly and glanced at Gu Ya.</p><p>Gu Ya trembled, "We've... never seen such a Mist Beast before."</p><p>Terror filled her heart. This giant serpent Mist Beast was too horrifying. Its aura and pressure were comparable to a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>The Mist Beasts encountered in the Storm Realm before were at most comparable to Deity Transformation stage cultivators, and those encounters were extremely rare. Yet, each time, they resulted in devastating consequences.</p><p>It turned out that the greatest threat wasn't the Chang You Tribe at all. If a Mist Beast comparable to this giant serpent appeared, it could easily flatten the Storm Realm!</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, don't worry. Such powerful Mist Beasts are extremely rare even in the Mist Sea…"  Si Lu, noticing the hesitation in everyone's eyes, quickly explained.  "The birth of Mist Beasts is related to spiritual energy. The richer the spiritual energy, the more likely powerful Mist Beasts are to spawn.  Areas with sparse spiritual energy aren't as dangerous. Those places are mostly occupied by the noble tribes, who are responsible for clearing them out.  Vassal Tribes generally don't encounter such Mist Beasts."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this. So the Foreign Tribes chose their territories based on their own strength as well. Insufficient strength, coupled with occupying fertile lands, would only invite disaster upon the tribe. Conversely, those tribes that declined and gradually weakened would voluntarily relinquish their territories and move elsewhere.</p><p>In this way, many internal conflicts among the Foreign Tribes could be resolved without bloodshed.</p><p>"Will the Si You Tribe send someone to eliminate this giant serpent later?" Qin Sang looked around, but found no other presence.</p><p>"Not necessarily. They may not have discovered it yet. Even if they do, they'll likely observe it for a while. Perhaps this Mist Beast will dissipate on its own soon," Si Lu explained.</p><p>Although Mist Beasts were dangerous, they were also easy to deal with because they wouldn't exist for long. Their lifespan was uncertain and unrelated to their strength.  The Foreign Tribes hadn't yet discovered a pattern.</p><p>Mist Beasts left nothing behind after death, and there was no benefit to slaying them other than honing one's divine abilities.  As long as it was determined that the Mist Beast wouldn't invade their territory, it was perfectly acceptable to avoid it from afar and wait for it to disperse.</p><p>"This is a rare opportunity.  I'd like to test the Mist Beast's divine abilities. Would that be a problem?" Qin Sang then asked.</p><p>Si Lu hesitated for a moment. "Mist Beasts gather and disperse without a trace.  If Fellow Daoist is careful not to leave any痕迹 (traces), it should be fine."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Please, both of you, act as my backup!"</p><p>Before his voice faded, everyone suddenly felt a tightness in their hearts, as if they were being targeted by a terrifying presence.</p><p>The giant serpent's head rose from the mist.  Its eyes were two empty sockets, yet everyone could sense a fierce intent within, making them inwardly apprehensive.</p><p>Suddenly, a sword light flashed, cutting away the pressure on everyone. Gu Ya and the others quickly steadied their minds.</p><p>Qin Sang rose into the air on his sword, charging towards the giant serpent.</p><p>Su Nu and Si Lu simultaneously flew to the sides, guarding against external threats and casting spells to conceal the fluctuations of the battle.</p><p>As he drew closer to the giant serpent, his senses became clearer. The aura of this Mist Beast was astonishingly comparable to a mid-Void Refinement cultivator!</p><p>There were other Mist Beasts within the mist cloud, but their strength was at most equivalent to Deity Transformation stage cultivators.</p><p>The giant serpent stared fixedly at Qin Sang, its ferocity intensifying. It let out a roar, its massive body emerging from the mist cloud, instantly obscuring half the sky. A slight movement from it stirred wind and clouds.</p><p>The Mist Beasts within the mist cloud, as if commanded, rushed out in droves, charging towards Qin Sang.</p><p>With a wave of Qin Sang's sleeve, the swarm of beasts melted away like snow. Glancing at the annihilated Mist Beasts, he raised his hand, beckoning a few wisps of white Qi into his palm.</p><p>The Mist Beasts reminded Qin Sang of the Cloud Beasts from the ancient immortal battlefield in the Small Cold Region. However, Cloud Beasts left behind corpses, while the only thing left behind by Mist Beasts was this wisp of white Qi.  A moment later, the white Qi quietly dispersed, and the Mist Beasts' traces in the world vanished completely.</p><p>The giant serpent finally lost its patience. Opening its massive maw, it spewed a torrent of mist that surged towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze turned cold. The Grey Warbler Sword flashed, appearing above the giant serpent.  In the next instant, the giant serpent fell into the sword formation.</p><p>The sword formation was less conspicuous, and within it, everything was under Qin Sang's control.</p><p>Amidst the vast, boundless starry sea of the formation, the giant serpent, perhaps for the first time since its birth, felt small. It revealed an anxious and restless expression, roaring repeatedly as it lashed its tail against the nearest sword star.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The impacts caused the starry sea to tremble continuously.</p><p>Qin Sang watched coldly, continuously directing starlight to slash at the giant serpent. But after a while, he discovered that the giant serpent's attacks were repetitive, lacking any understanding of how to break the formation.</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang deliberately exposed a slight flaw, which the giant serpent immediately noticed, turning its head and charging towards it.</p><p>Qin Sang closed the flaw, changing the formation, and the giant serpent reverted to its previous behavior.</p><p>"Its spiritual awareness is very acute, but its intelligence is limited.  It acts on instinct. But if my strength were insufficient and I allowed it to continue these impacts, eventually I would reveal a true flaw."</p><p>Qin Sang observed the giant serpent, finally concluding, "Although this beast is powerful, an ordinary early Void Refinement cultivator could handle it."</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang no longer held back, employing the dual-layered formation technique.  Sword lights, one after another, slashed at the giant serpent.</p><p>The giant serpent finally succumbed, its body severed into several sections.  However, with a writhing of the mist, it restored itself, only slightly weaker and smaller.</p><p>This was what made Mist Beasts so difficult to deal with.  They had no vital points and were hard to kill.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to erode it with sword light. The giant serpent's body shrank repeatedly, eventually vanishing. Like the other Mist Beasts, it left behind only a wisp of white Qi upon death, which dispersed into nothingness.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang eliminate the Mist Beast, everyone gathered around him, erased the remaining Qi fluctuations, and flew away on the flying boat.</p><p>Not long after they left, two streaks of light arrived – two Si You Tribe cultivators.</p><p>After circling the area, one of them said curiously, "Could Master have been mistaken?  There's no Mist Beast here."</p><p>"Master deduced from the celestial phenomena that a Void Realm Mist Beast might spawn in this area. He only sent us to check, not that there definitely would be one."</p><p>The other cultivator looked around, his face lighting up with joy. "It's better that there's no Void Realm Mist Beast.  Otherwise, we'd have to keep watch here. Now we can return and report."</p><p>His companion stopped him. "Not so fast! Let's search a bit more…"</p><p>The two of them flew around the area again, but found nothing. Then they turned back and flew away along the same path they came.</p>
