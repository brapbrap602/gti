<h1>Chapter 1591: Meteorite Divine Whip</h1><p>The county city bustled with activity.</p><p>Qin Sang had barely stepped through the city gates when he sensed the auras of several Golden Core cultivators. This auction clearly held a strong allure for them.</p><p>Tianzhong County was similar in scale to Yanshui Market.</p><p>The auction was being held in the cultivator's market on the west side of the city.</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his pace, strolling through the streets and alleys. Passing through the mortal marketplace, he saw the hustle and bustle of everyday life, and for a moment, he remembered that he was still amidst the mortal realm.</p><p>For over a hundred years, he had devoted himself to arduous cultivation, day and night, becoming a recluse detached from the world.</p><p>Recalling his bold pronouncements back in the Great Sui Dynasty felt like a lifetime ago.</p><p>Now, he was among the most powerful individuals in this world, yet he was still far from his goal. The path ahead remained shrouded in uncertainty, and he dared not slacken his efforts.</p><p>The hawkers' cries pulled Qin Sang back to the present.</p><p>Aromas wafted through the air.</p><p>Though Qin Sang's cultivation level had long since allowed him to abstain from food, his appetite was unexpectedly piqued. As he searched for a suitable shop, he suddenly remembered that his Qianjun Ring hadn't held mundane items like gold or silver for a very long time.</p><p>Spirit stones were valuable, but they might bring misfortune upon these merchants.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang's eyes shimmered with spiritual light. Sweeping his gaze across the street, he noticed various ailments afflicting the mortals' bodies.  A thought struck him. He retrieved a few medicinal pills and, gathering his Qi, condensed water to dissolve the medicinal properties.</p><p>He strode forward through the crowded street. The bustling crowd parted on their own, making way for him, yet they seemed oblivious to his presence, unable to perceive anything unusual.</p><p>Without any visible movement from Qin Sang, an assortment of delicacies materialized in his hands. He proceeded down the street, consuming them with unrestrained gusto, disregarding any semblance of decorum.</p><p>His stomach seemed bottomless, as he devoured every delicacy the market had to offer.</p><p>With each step Qin Sang took, a gentle rain of spiritual energy fell, subtly permeating the mortals' bodies.</p><p>The mortals remained utterly unaware.</p><p>"Eh? Old woman, my back... it's healed!"</p><p>At the entrance of the marketplace stood a steamed bun stall, run by an elderly couple for many years.</p><p>The old man had suffered an injury in his youth, leaving behind a persistent ailment. As he aged, his back became increasingly hunched, and the constant labor exacerbated the pain.</p><p>Just now, as the old man habitually set down a steamer basket and stood up, he straightened up completely, startling himself.</p><p>"Aiyo! Slow down! I keep telling you to ask Immortal Master Yue on North Street for some medicine, but you're always too stingy. What kind of fit are you having now?"</p><p>The old woman was startled, dropping her rolling pin.  Anxiously waving her hands, she abruptly stood up to help her husband. To her surprise, she discovered that her own legs were no longer in pain.</p><p>The elderly couple exchanged bewildered glances.</p><p>Suddenly, a commotion erupted in the marketplace. The couple hurried outside.</p><p>Everyone felt an unprecedented lightness. The chronic ailments that had plagued them had vanished in an instant.</p><p>Some knelt on the ground, weeping with joy.</p><p>"The Immortals have manifested!"</p><p>"Heaven has eyes, the Immortals have manifested!"</p><p>…</p><p>The gentle rain of spiritual energy dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang wiped the grease from his mouth and strolled leisurely out of the marketplace.</p><p>At the entrance, a man and a woman, both Golden Core cultivators, happened to pass by.  They stared blankly at the immortal-like figure receding into the distance, their faces etched with astonishment.</p><p>His appetite sated, Qin Sang wasted no more time and headed straight for the auction.</p><p>In a corner of the cultivator's market…</p><p>Qin Sang stood before an inconspicuous three-story wooden building, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>It was just an ordinary shop selling spiritual materials. There was no sign of the expected bustling crowd. The few cultivators entering and exiting were all at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Glancing at the invitation in his hand, Qin Sang stepped inside. He immediately confirmed that he was in the right place; the seemingly young shopkeeper was, in fact, a late-stage Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>He approached the shopkeeper and presented his invitation.</p><p>The shopkeeper opened it, his expression unchanging. He gestured towards the inner hall, "Honored guest, please come inside."</p><p>Inside the inner hall, the shopkeeper closed the door and bowed respectfully, "Gong Xingqing, Steward of the Liuzhou Hall's Tianzhong County branch, greets Senior Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, glancing around, "Where is Fellow Daoist Jiang Mu? Are you holding the auction here?"</p><p>"Elder Jiang is occupied with urgent matters and cannot attend at the moment. He instructed this junior to ensure Senior Qin receives the best possible hospitality."</p><p>With that, Gong Xingqing opened the back door, revealing a spacious courtyard connected to the building opposite. "There are too many irrelevant people in the front, and we were concerned about disturbing Senior. When the auction begins, Senior may proceed from here to attend... Does Senior Qin have any companions?"</p><p>"I am alone."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Gong Xingqing.</p><p>Gong Xingqing guessed what Qin Sang was thinking and said respectfully, "Senior should still have the token Elder Jiang gifted you, correct? There will be a Treasure Exchange after the auction. Senior may rest in a private chamber for now. If Senior is interested in the auction, this junior will arrange the best seat.  When the Treasure Exchange begins, guidance will appear on your token."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled upon hearing this. "Isn't the Treasure Exchange held within the city? With the influence of your Liuzhou Hall in the Central Plains, why such secrecy?"</p><p>Gong Xingqing didn't dare to argue.  "Senior is unaware, but before the Zhongyuan Dharma Assembly and the Ullambana Festival, our Hall always holds similar Treasure Exchanges, primarily inviting trusted fellow Daoists to provide an opportunity for mutual exchange. This time was supposed to be the same. We had made all the necessary preparations to ensure the identities of our esteemed guests would remain confidential, allowing for worry-free transactions. However, a slight unforeseen circumstance arose."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. He disliked unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>"Someone recently approached our Hall, commissioning us to host a Treasure Exchange. However, they requested that the Exchange commence during the auction and that the location be outside the city, kept secret until the last moment. As we are merely hosting, we can only guarantee the safety of the Treasure Exchange itself. Senior may decide whether or not to participate."</p><p>Gong Xingqing explained the situation clearly, outlining the advantages and disadvantages. "Rest assured, Senior, after the auction, our Hall will endeavor to organize another Treasure Exchange, ensuring Senior does not return empty-handed."</p><p>"How many true treasures will remain until the second exchange?" Qin Sang scoffed.</p><p>Gong Xingqing remained bowed, not daring to respond.</p><p>"To make your esteemed Hall change its plans at the last minute, what kind of compensation did they offer?  I wonder what esteemed expert possesses such extravagance?"  Qin Sang was curious.</p><p>Gong Xingqing shook his head. "Forgive this junior, Senior, but my position is humble. I am only privy to this much information."</p><p>The matter had come to this; he had to participate no matter what.</p><p>Experts in the cultivation world were neither few nor many. Each retreat often lasted decades or even centuries, making them elusive figures. Treasures, too, had to be accumulated slowly.</p><p>This kind of high-level Treasure Exchange could only be organized near the Dharma Assemblies, and each one was a rare opportunity.</p><p>As for safety...</p><p>If a true threat arose, even the Liuzhou Hall's own Treasure Exchange would likely be unable to contain it.</p><p>"Arrange a seat for this poor Daoist in the front and take these items to be auctioned."</p><p>Qin Sang tossed over a mustard seed pouch containing a few captured magical treasures. While unremarkable on their own, after his refinement, they would certainly be coveted by Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Gong Xingqing acknowledged with a "Yes," hurried ahead, sending out a transmission talisman, and then led Qin Sang into the magnificent hall opposite.</p><p>The hall held a hidden dimension within.</p><p>The interior space was more than ten times larger than it appeared from the outside, resplendent and exquisite.</p><p>"Is the Liuzhou Hall's headquarters located here?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused silently as he ascended to the top floor of the hall, entering a private chamber within the auction area, which offered a panoramic view of the hall below.</p><p>Dismissing his attendants…</p><p>Qin Sang placed the token on the table and swept his gaze over the scene below.</p><p>The auction was about to begin. The hall was already eighty percent full, mostly with Golden Core cultivators. Such a gathering demonstrated the Liuzhou Hall's considerable influence.</p><p>Above the main hall were three more levels, encircled by private chambers, each shielded by restrictions that blocked spiritual sense.  Presumably, many Nascent Soul cultivators, like himself, were awaiting the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>The clamor from the hall was muffled by the chamber's restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, cultivating his spirit and patiently waiting for the auction to begin, while awakening the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>He always deployed the Skyeye Butterfly during these auctions.</p><p>The Skyeye divine ability could pierce through disguises that others couldn't detect. Unfortunately, Qin Sang's luck had been poor, and he hadn't yet stumbled upon any hidden treasures.</p><p>Suddenly, a bell rang. A middle-aged scholar ascended the platform, followed by a procession of beautiful young women carrying bronze trays, their captivating smiles drawing attention.</p><p>As the auction progressed, treasures were unveiled and sold, the clamor in the hall rising in waves.</p><p>"A Buddhist body refinement cultivation method, the 'Arhat Jade Bone Manual'!"</p><p>When the middle-aged scholar lifted the cover of a bronze tray, revealing the contents of the jade slip within, Qin Sang opened his eyes for the first time and looked over.</p><p>Body refinement cultivators were practically extinct in the Northern Realm.</p><p>The Central Plains, however, still preserved the tradition, particularly within the Buddhist sects, where powerful body refinement experts were known to appear, capable of withstanding magical treasures with their physical bodies.</p><p>The 'Seven Masters Buddha Seal' was most likely brought to the Xiaoxiang region from the Central Plains.</p><p>This Buddhist body refinement method piqued Qin Sang's interest.</p><p>His primary focus was currently on the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus,' but before attempting to break through to the Nascent Soul bottleneck, he needed to strengthen his physical body to improve his chances of success.</p><p>The 'Seven Masters Buddha Seal' was also a Buddhist divine ability.</p><p>Moreover, cultivating a demonic technique with a human body would inevitably lead to discrepancies at higher realms.</p><p>Studying the 'Arhat Jade Bone Manual' might provide some valuable insights.</p><p>"The 'Arhat Jade Bone Manual,' origin unknown, only three layers remain, allowing cultivation up to the late Golden Core stage equivalent. Starting bid: ten thousand spirit stones. Each increment must be no less than one thousand.  Please begin your bids…"</p><p>The middle-aged scholar's introduction was brief, yet the response was somewhat lukewarm.</p><p>Body refinement cultivators were rare.</p><p>Dual cultivation of body and spirit wasn't within the scope of Golden Core cultivators' considerations.</p><p>Even for those seeking to utilize body refinement to aid their Nascent Soul breakthrough, there were numerous less incomplete methods available, at least ones that included the Nascent Soul stages, offering a more comprehensive approach.</p><p>This manual was somewhat impractical, and the Liuzhou Hall was clearly aware of this, setting a low starting bid.</p><p>Qin Sang was also disappointed, but figuring he was already there, he ultimately acquired the manual for a mere few tens of thousands of spirit stones.</p><p>As the auction reached its halfway point…</p><p>The token suddenly vibrated, emitting a faint green light.</p><p>Simultaneously, the middle-aged scholar's voice echoed from the hall below.</p><p>He unveiled another bronze tray and picked up a nine-sectioned iron whip, smiling before speaking. "The next treasure is rather unique, and I hope our demonic fellow Daoists will not take offense. This item is called the Meteorite Divine Whip.  It is said to be crafted from a rare type of meteorite, possessing a certain restraining effect on some demonic divine abilities…"</p><p>Qin Sang had just grabbed the token, sensing the guidance within, and was about to leave when he abruptly stopped, turning sharply to fix his gaze on the iron whip in the scholar's hand.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>A faint, familiar aura caused Qin Sang's expression to shift slightly.</p><p>The aura emanating from this treasure was remarkably similar to the Demon Binding Rope!</p><p>Back in the Ziwei Palace, Qingjun and Bai had used the Demon Binding Rope to restrain the Jade Bone Devil, casting it into the spatial turbulence to be obliterated.  Qingjun had taken the rope with her.</p><p>Now, he was sensing a similar aura from this Meteorite Divine Whip.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly activated its Skyeye divine ability, revealing the Meteorite Divine Whip in minute detail.</p><p>"The third section, the fourth section... the seventh, eighth, and ninth sections..."</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swiftly scanned the whip. Suddenly, he raised his hand and shot out a streak of light, activating the chamber's restriction.</p><p>On these five sections of the whip were markings identical to those on the Demon Binding Rope, resembling some kind of special runes!</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the iron chain he'd discovered in the Seven Kills Palace's Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>The Meteorite Divine Whip, like the iron chain, was clearly re-forged from fragments of the damaged Demon Binding Rope. Hence its ability to restrain certain demonic divine abilities.  However, without the corresponding spirit array, its power couldn't compare to the true Demon Binding Rope.</p><p>These "certain demonic divine abilities" likely referred to the legacy of the Ancient Devils, which had since been integrated into contemporary demonic cultivation.</p><p>After all, the Demon Binding Rope was specifically designed to restrain Ancient Devils.</p><p>The Central Plains also possessed a Demon Binding Rope!</p><p>Where there was a Demon Binding Rope, there were Ancient Devils. And where there were Ancient Devils, there might be an Ascension Platform!</p><p>Bidding had already begun below.</p><p>The whip's usefulness was limited, but its ability to restrain demonic cultivators intrigued many, causing the initial bids to surge.</p><p>'Bang! Bang!'</p><p>A knock came at the door.  Receiving permission, Gong Xingqing hurried in, puzzled to see Qin Sang hadn't left for the Treasure Exchange. "Senior..."</p><p>"I want that item, regardless of the cost. If I don't return to collect it, deliver it to Fellow Daoist Jiang's residence."</p><p>Qin Sang pointed towards the hall below, tossing Gong Xingqing a pouch of spirit stones.</p><p>Gong Xingqing glanced down, his expression troubled. As a Liuzhou Hall steward, interfering with the auction was against protocol.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was willing to pay. Sighing inwardly, Gong Xingqing said, "This junior obeys."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and made an even more demanding request. "Also, investigate the origin of this item, who refined it, and where the meteorite was initially discovered."</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Gong Xingqing truly couldn't agree to this, his face etched with difficulty. "Forgive this junior, Senior, but we only appraise the value of treasures. We never inquire about their origins or the identity of the consignor.  This item was transferred from another branch several years ago; finding the seller would be impossible. Moreover, such actions are against our rules…"</p><p>"If you can't find them, then investigate.  Does this poor Daoist appear to lack spirit stones?"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, suddenly unleashing his aura. He asked coldly, "What rules?"</p><p>The aura of a late Nascent Soul cultivator erupted, striking Gong Xingqing like a hammer, causing him to stumble back to the door in terror.</p><p>"Inform Fellow Daoist Jiang that this poor Daoist awaits good news."</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his aura and walked towards the exit. As he passed Gong Xingqing, he left a final, quiet remark.</p><p>His sudden display of cultivation was a calculated decision, weighing the pros and cons in an instant.</p><p>Searching for clues related to the Demon Binding Rope was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. He needed the Liuzhou Hall's resources.</p><p>Even if he discovered the origin of the Demon Binding Rope and found an Ancient Devil, he would require assistance to restrain it.  Qin Sang hadn't forgotten the Jade Bone Devil's formidable strength.</p><p>If he found the Ascension Platform, as long as there was a place for him, he wouldn't mind letting others hitch a ride. The Liuzhou Hall, with its deep background, was qualified to cooperate with him.</p><p>On the other hand, it was also a warning to the Liuzhou Hall – they had best not harbor any ill intentions towards him during this Treasure Exchange.</p>
