<h1>Chapter 2061: The Foggy Year</h1><p>“Old Wu, your words are a bit too decisive,” someone interjected, “Do you think we’re the only ones who know there are good things in the Great Ascension Grounds?  Surely powerful cultivators wouldn't be uninterested? Perhaps countless experts have already been there, turning the Source Sea upside down, we just don't know about it.”</p><p>The ship's captain wasn't annoyed, chuckling, “Those great powers are in a different league than us. I just want Friend Qin to understand how dangerous it is, so he doesn't underestimate it and lose his life.”</p><p>“That makes sense!”</p><p>The man nodded in agreement, “Logically, the Source Sea should be a sacred place for cultivators of poison techniques, but even those cultivators only dare to linger on the outskirts.  I've heard that many who went in never returned, and now there are all sorts of stories, getting more and more exaggerated.”</p><p>“Thank you both for the warning, I appreciate it.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, expressing his gratitude, then curiously asked, “Since the Source Sea is so powerful, how did such a force decline, and even lose its legacy? Did it provoke some powerful enemy?”</p><p>“Who knows?”</p><p>The ship's captain shrugged, squeezing the remaining venom from the pouch, ending the strange fish's life. He lifted the fish's head, broke off all its sharp teeth, and then kicked the carcass back into the sea.  The bloody smell attracted a swarm of fish, and the surface of the water was instantly covered with white bellies.</p><p>This sight made the captain laugh heartily, throwing the fish teeth to everyone, “A share for everyone who sees it!”</p><p>Then, turning back to Qin Sang, he said, “Whether the legends are true or false, only Heaven knows. Maybe they're all made up.  Even if such a force really existed, consider the Source Sea's location.  It's not so strange.”</p><p>This place is located between three races, a battleground.  Even now, they’re not exactly harmonious, let alone in ancient times.  The Source Sea, in such a location, once it showed signs of decline, its destruction was only a matter of time.</p><p>“Not necessarily,” the previous man again contradicted the captain, “Someone saw mysterious human cultivators far beyond the Source Sea. It is said that some hidden sects refused to be governed by the Great Zhou, escaping to the outer seas, their legacy lasting for a long time. They are closer to the other races, yet they remained safe. What exactly happened in ancient times is hard to say clearly…”</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently to their conversation. Although it was all rumors and legends, he could still glimpse a corner of the iceberg; the situation in the East Sea was far more complex than he imagined.</p><p>What surprised him most was the Poison God.</p><p>After ascending to the Greater Thousand World, Qin Sang had heard very few rumors about Great Ascension cultivators, mostly fragmented pieces mixed with mythological elements. This was the clearest account yet, even mentioning their title.</p><p>Could the Poison God be related to the *Poison God Scripture*?</p><p>Thinking of the *Poison God Scripture*'s wonder, upon obtaining it, he knew it was a top-tier cultivation method.</p><p>During the Nascent Soul stage, he relied on this method to make rapid progress in his cultivation.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang sent a voice transmission to Sword Servant, “Friend, has Senior Tian Yue ever mentioned the *Poison God Scripture*?”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't asked Upper Person Tian Yue, but he was eight out of ten sure that after learning of his ability to control poison, Tian Yue had deliberately made this arrangement, leaving behind the *Poison God Scripture* to guide him.</p><p>Otherwise, how could it be such a coincidence that the first time he entered the Jusan Altar, he obtained a cultivation method that perfectly suited him, along with a cultivation sanctuary?…</p><p>Where did Upper Person Tian Yue obtain it? Did he go to the Source Sea, or did the Poison God also fall in the Ziwei Palace?</p><p>“I haven’t heard Master mention it,” Sword Servant's reply came quickly.</p><p>At this time, the treasure ship continued to drift south. Qin Sang stood by the ship's railing, gazing at the Source Sea.</p><p>Because he only had a fragment of the *Poison God Scripture*, lacking the sections above the Void Refinement stage, he abandoned it after reaching Void Refinement. Unexpectedly, now he had another clue.</p><p>“Countless cultivators have gone to the outer seas, they must have found some treasures related to the Source Sea. Has anyone collected these things?”</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's question, the captain looked at him carefully, “Friend, are you perhaps coming for the Source Sea?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, “The Great Ascension legacy, who wouldn’t be tempted?”</p><p>“You’re quite honest.”</p><p>The captain nodded, “There are countless treasures in the outer seas, and countless of unknown origin.  Every family has some treasured heirlooms that haven't been touched for years.  Ask around, maybe you'll find something.”</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him and, following his advice, went to ask the merchants on board.</p><p>The treasure ship sailed in mid-air, taking a large detour, and successfully arrived at the southern side of the Source Sea.</p><p>That day, the captain steered the treasure ship to a stone island, seeing the devastation below, he frowned slightly and muttered, "They've moved again!"</p><p>He took out a compass, activated it with spiritual energy, and after a moment received a response. He steered the treasure ship, and soon a sea fog appeared ahead.  After traveling through the fog for a while, an island came into view.</p><p>A bustling market town, filled almost entirely with human cultivators, occupied the island.  Qin Sang remained at the prow of the ship until it docked, then informed the captain before gracefully disembarking.</p><p>Because the market town was frequently relocated, the merchants made little effort in decorating their shops; they were all simple and straightforward. Qin Sang chose one at random and entered.</p><p>The shop was deserted.  A young attendant in a green tunic was engrossed in a book, only noticing Qin Sang's approach upon their arrival. He quickly stood, bowing apologetically. "My apologies, Immortal. I was completely absorbed in my reading.  Please, forgive my lack of attention! Is there anything that catches your eye?"</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the shop, noting the abundance of pills. Tapping the counter lightly, he said, "Do you have any items, spells, or scrolls of unknown origin? Bring them all out."</p><p>The attendant paused, then smiled broadly.  "Please wait a moment, Immortal. I'll fetch them immediately."</p><p>He swiftly returned from the back room with several small pouches.  "Immortal, please examine these."</p><p>Qin Sang opened one pouch to inspect its contents, the attendant standing silently beside him, his face expectant. These were all unsold items gathering dust, and selling even one would be a success.</p><p>He scanned the contents with his spiritual sense.  The first pouch contained various fragments of magical artifacts, some seemingly significant, but all devoid of power and therefore worthless.</p><p>He opened the second pouch, then the next, examining each one. He spent more time on a pouch filled with jade slips and ancient scrolls. If this Poison God were the Poison God, then in the Source Sea there must be cultivation techniques and secret arts based on the *Poison God Canon*.  Even if only fragments remained, if there was the slightest connection to the *Poison God Canon*, he would recognize it…</p><p>Unfortunately, none of the items offered any such techniques or secrets.</p><p>He moved to the next shop, repeating the process. He eventually bought a few interesting trinkets, but failed to achieve his true goal.</p><p>The ship remained on the island for several days before setting sail again. At each market stop, some passengers would disembark and others would board. Qin Sang would investigate each time.</p><p>Even Su Nu noticed his unusual behavior.  "Qin Xiong, do you believe the legends of the Source Sea are true?"</p><p>She had initially scoffed at such tales, but Qin Sang's determination was unsettling.  He repeated the explanation he had given to Captain Wu.</p><p>Su Nu said, "Since Qin Xiong is interested, perhaps your little sister could accompany you on a trip to the Source Sea."</p><p>Qin Sang closed a bamboo scroll in his hands, gazing at the Source Sea with a thoughtful expression before gently shaking his head. "No."</p><p>His extensive search had yielded no trace of anything connected to the *Poison God Canon*; not even a decent poison cultivation technique.  Could such a powerful force truly vanish without a trace?</p><p>Of course, he might simply be too late, the evidence already "cleaned up."</p><p>Regardless of the Source Sea's danger, he had found no clues, and entering without a lead would be like a blind search.  A complete exploration of the Source Sea could take years, clearly impractical.</p><p>Qin Sang's interest was solely piqued by the name "Poison God," a wild goose chase.  Risking his life for this was not worth it.</p><p>Furthermore, there was a more crucial reason for abandoning his pursuit of poison cultivation: his poison pearl was shattered!</p><p>Had the pearl remained intact, he might have ventured into the Source Sea.  Without the pearl to suppress the toxins in his body, the *Poison God Canon* was merely a superior cultivation technique, lacking its former miraculous effects.</p><p>Having practiced poison cultivation, Qin Sang understood more about dealing with external poisons than his peers, yet even so, the Source Sea's danger meant he could not guarantee his safety.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang abandoned the idea of entering the Source Sea. If he were to explore it, he would do so after finding the Storm World and significantly increasing his cultivation.</p><p>However, Qin Sang continued his inquiries throughout the journey, until the time came to disembark.</p><p>The ship had circumnavigated the Source Sea, and would continue eastward, but Qin Sang and his companions needed to travel north to find the teleportation array.</p><p>After leaving the ship, Qin Sang summoned a magical vessel, taking turns with Su Nu to control it, carefully concealing their presence.  The journey was uneventful.</p><p>Inside the vessel:</p><p>Su Nu held a sea chart, circling a location. They were not far from it.</p><p>"Qin Xiong," Su Nu called, "That's the Yi people's航路.  Si Lu encountered them here. Perhaps we should leave Gu Ya and the others behind; the three of us can investigate first.  If we encounter trouble, it will be easier to escape. We can return for them once we've found the teleportation array."</p><p>"Good."</p><p>Qin Sang found a deserted island and left Gu Ya and the others there, then the three of them concealed themselves and quietly entered that sea area.</p><p>They were initially wary, but after a while, sensing no danger.  It seemed the outsiders hadn't realized Si Lu had arrived via the teleportation array. ...</p><p>However, according to Si Lu, even if the other party had noticed, there was no need to worry; their meeting point was far from the array.</p><p>After a search, Si Lu finally determined their direction. He led Qin Sang and the others onward.  A vast expanse of islets appeared ahead.</p><p>Thousands upon thousands of islets dotted the sea, but none were large; the biggest was less than ten miles across, the smallest barely large enough to stand on.</p><p>The tide surged constantly, often washing over the islets. Vegetation was scarce, spiritual energy thin—a barren wasteland.</p><p>"Is this it?"</p><p>Qin Sang swept his spiritual sense around, detecting no unusual fluctuations.</p><p>"These islets are part of the teleportation array. Please wait a moment," Si Lu nodded, his figure flashing as he landed on one islet.</p><p>He then flitted from islet to islet, making hand seals. Qin Sang and Su Nu carefully observed his actions.  After some time, with no perceptible change, the scenery before them subtly shifted.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang and Su Nu confirm the existence of the array.</p><p>"Masterful craftsmanship!"</p><p>Qin Sang marveled.</p><p>All the islets were unremarkable, even lacking spiritual energy, yet they formed a grand array.  Was it a natural wonder, or the work of a supremely powerful cultivator?</p><p>Finally, Si Lu landed on a rock.</p><p>Previously bare and covered in moss, the array now revealed itself!</p><p>"To prevent accidents, we made some adjustments. However, the array is so complex that even Xia Changshi, after careful consideration, only dared to modify this corner," Si Lu pointed to a section of the array.</p><p>Qin Sang flew forward, silently analyzing it.  "Xia Changshi was very measured; this part is easily repaired."</p><p>Su Nu spoke, "Qin, give me the flying vessel.  You two repair the array while I bring them here."</p><p>After Su Nu left, Qin Sang and Si Lu worked diligently. By the time she returned with the others, the array was repaired.</p><p>Gu Ya's heart pounded with excitement. The Storm Realm was drawing closer. After centuries of wandering, she could finally return to her sect!</p><p>"Activate the array!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded firmly.</p><p>Si Lu stepped forward, inserted spirit stones, and with a hum, the runes in the array lit up one by one, radiating light.</p><p>The light grew increasingly brilliant.</p><p>"It's connected!"</p><p>Si Lu, sensing the connection, exclaimed joyfully. The array beneath them trembled violently, and they felt a moment of disorientation before being engulfed by the light.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly experienced the sensation of spatial displacement.  Aside from the major teleportation arrays connecting the Eight Great Heavenly States, this was likely the longest distance he had ever traveled.</p><p>The feeling was similar to those between smaller cities, only more intense, but completely unlike the Eight Great Heavenly States' arrays.</p><p>It felt like traversing time itself, highlighting the uniqueness of those larger arrays.</p><p>No wonder there were so few of them.</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, Qin Sang felt the pressure lift. Opening his eyes, he found himself in a dark cavern.</p><p>Everyone awoke, even the Qingga and Qingyi brothers, though having broken through to the fourth level of the Yuan Realm, felt a bit uncomfortable.  They quickly recovered.</p><p>As a precaution, Qin Sang had made adjustments to the array. They moved toward the cavern's exit.</p><p>The stone door was tightly sealed. Si Lu approached, tapping it several times before gently pushing it open.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A cold wind carrying a white mist rushed into the cavern.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a world of white, thick fog obscuring everything.  Without spiritual energy, even a few feet ahead was invisible.  Creatures without cultivation couldn't survive here.</p><p>Si Lu frowned, cautiously sensing for a while. "I forgot; it's the Fog Year."</p><p>39314321...</p>
