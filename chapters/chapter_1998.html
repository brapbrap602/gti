<h1>Chapter 1989: Ji Tian Sect</h1><p>A group of people crowded on the deck of the ship, admiring the magnificent view below.</p><p>North of the Fire Domain, endless lava continued.</p><p>In the Fire Domain, mountains and land were still visible, like islands in the sea, but here, the land was completely swallowed by lava.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, it was a sea of crimson.</p><p>Everywhere was a boundless expanse of lava, a true sea of lava, with no place to set foot.  The ship had been flying day and night for several days, yet it hadn't flown out of the lava's range.</p><p>Even cultivators who practiced fire-type cultivation techniques in the Fire Domain dared not venture too far.</p><p>For countless years, lava had flowed here, flames burning eternally. For most living beings, this was a dead zone.</p><p>“Look! Look! Is that a Phoenix Flower?”</p><p>A young girl pointed below and shouted.</p><p>Everyone looked, and saw a point of crimson light flickering in the surging lava.</p><p>This crimson light was deeper and more vibrant than the firelight in the lava, but the light was too small, and it bobbed up and down in the lava, easily overlooked.</p><p>A cultivator skilled in spiritual eye techniques circulated their true energy, seeing a strangely shaped flower within the light.</p><p>Being able to bloom in lava, this flower must be a spiritual flower. A cultivator familiar with pharmacopoeias recognized it as the rather rare spiritual flower—the Phoenix Flower, as the girl had said.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>The ship flew over the flower, and the girl couldn't help but look disappointed.</p><p>The Phoenix Flower was a spiritual herb she needed for her cultivation, and she had searched for it for a long time without success. She had hoped to find it at the Ji Tian Ceremony, but unexpectedly saw it here.</p><p>But the ship was flying too fast, and it couldn't stop for them. It seemed they would miss their chance.</p><p>“Liu, give me a hand, I'll go get the flower for my junior sister!”</p><p>A tall and handsome young man stepped forward, threw a golden rope to his companion, and leaped from the deck.</p><p>His companion caught the rope, flicked his wrist, and threw it downwards forcefully.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A golden light shot through the air, constantly following the young man.</p><p>The rope itself was less than a zhang long, but now it seemed endless, infinitely extending as the young man shot towards the ground.</p><p>The young man estimated the distance, performed a hand seal technique, formed a hand out of thin air, and reached for the flower.</p><p>At that moment, the young man suddenly sensed a hidden aura in the lava, carrying furious anger. His heart sank, and he knew something was wrong.</p><p>The flower had a guardian beast!</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The lava surged, and with a roar, a fiery red figure charged out.</p><p>It looked like a snake, and it fiercely struck the hand seal, shattering it instantly.</p><p>The beast continued its charge. The young man could already see the beast's sharp fangs, his face slightly pale.</p><p>The people on the ship also noticed this. His companion pulled hard on the rope, shouting: “Danger! Yin, come back quickly!”</p><p>In a moment of crisis, the young man woke up, grabbed the end of the rope, but didn't flee immediately. He spat out a green light.</p><p>The green light was a jade ring, which suddenly enlarged and then shrunk, instantly trapping the beast like a tight hoop.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The beast thrashed wildly, the jade ring unable to withstand the strain, instantly cracking.</p><p>The young man seized the fleeting opportunity, flicked out a flying sword, the sword light picking up the flower, and at the same time, the golden rope retracted, the ship speeding away.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The beast shattered the jade ring, its enemy only a green light, disappearing within a few breaths, leaving only its furious roar.</p><p>Hearing the faint, shrill roar from behind, everyone on the ship was somewhat apprehensive, looking at the flower in the young man's hand.</p><p>“You really haven't changed your ways!”</p><p>His companion patted the young man on the shoulder, “That Lone Shadow Ring, I remember you were saving it as a trump card for the ceremony. To ruin it for a Phoenix Flower, was it worth it?”</p><p>The young man grinned, handing the flower to the girl. Seeing the girl holding the flower in both hands, her eyes downcast, her face blushing, it was clearly worth it.</p><p>“Look ahead!”</p><p>There was a commotion from the bow, attracting everyone's attention.</p><p>The young man and the girl walked side-by-side to the bow, immediately captivated by the spectacular sight before them.</p><p>They saw a tide of mist in the void, thick water vapor obscuring the sky and forming a wall of fog, stretching across their path.</p><p>Using their spiritual senses, they could see that this mist had boundaries, forming a long band of fog.</p><p>They had reached the edge of the lava, and ahead lay a boundless expanse of water.</p><p>At the boundary, where surging magma clashed violently with a mighty river, a breathtaking scene unfolded.  Water vapor billowed, painting the earth in vibrant hues of red and blue, a long black line marking the apparent division between two distinct realms.</p><p>The Cloud-Traversing Treasure Ship bravely pierced the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang and Gu Yun Sou were enjoying tea and philosophical discussion in a quiet chamber.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou glanced outwards, saying, "We've entered Yuanlan Lake.  Daoist Yu's estate is in the northern part of the lake."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed intently, unable to discern any boundary; it was simply a lake.</p><p>"Daoist Yu's Gu He Garden is on an island in the center of the lake?" Qin Sang deduced, based on the name, that the legacy of Gu He Garden might be connected to the element of wood.</p><p>"You'll see when we arrive,"</p><p>Gu Yun Sou chuckled mysteriously, then turned serious. "In our plan regarding the Lesser Thousand World, Daoist Yu's Gu He Garden is our best bet for an alliance."</p><p>"Oh?" Qin Sang remained impassive, prompting Gu Yun Sou to elaborate.</p><p>"Daoist Yu, in his youth, was quite the remarkable figure, capturing the heart of a fairy from the Ji Tian Sect.  They became Daoist partners, a story much celebrated at the time. Sadly, his partner couldn't break through the Illusory Void realm and her lifespan ended. However, due to this connection, Daoist Yu holds considerable influence within the Ji Tian Sect."</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang mused, "Was Daoist Yu's partner the descendant of some elder?"</p><p>This wasn't a casual question.</p><p>A connection to the Ji Tian Sect was beneficial, but things could easily go too far.</p><p>If Gu He Garden were too powerful, they might overpower Qingyang Temple, leaving them with only scraps and unable to complain.</p><p>"Back then, Gu He Garden wasn't a prominent sect. Daoist Yu's partner was just an ordinary disciple. She only gained prominence after Daoist Yu broke through to the Illusory Void realm, but still pales in comparison to the descendants of Ji Tian Sect elders," Gu Yun Sou explained, sensing Qin Sang's concern.</p><p>Ji Tian Sect elders are all Illusory Void cultivators, holding immense power and profound cultivation.</p><p>"Daoist Yu is worried their relationship might fade, so he's bringing his most promising disciple to the Ji Tian Sect’s ceremony, hoping to forge another connection," Gu Yun Sou said with a smile.</p><p>This indicated that the relationship between Gu He Garden and the Ji Tian Sect wasn't particularly strong.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "Have you spoken to him?"</p><p>"Not yet," Gu Yun Sou shook his head. "We must discuss this with you first. Daoist Yu is shrewd; his expectations won't be low."</p><p>"Let's have him investigate that small pocket world first. We can discuss the rest later.  If we do need Gu He Garden's strength, I won't be stingy," Qin Sang stated firmly.</p><p>Possessing great treasures invites misfortune.</p><p>He never intended for Qingyang Temple to monopolize the pocket world; the legacy of the Falling Soul Abyss was already more than enough for them.</p><p>After several days of flight, upon seeing Gu He Garden's gate, Qin Sang understood Gu Yun Sou's peculiar tone.</p><p>Gu He Garden's gate was an enormous ancient tree.</p><p>This tree's trunk lay horizontally, floating on the water, drifting with the current.</p><p>The trunk spanned thousands of meters, its vast crown resembling a verdant island. Gu He Garden was built upon the trunk.</p><p>It appeared to be an ordinary spiritual locust tree, but a spiritual locust tree of this size was certainly extraordinary.</p><p>As the Cloud-Traversing Treasure Ship reached Gu He Garden, numerous figures flew down from the tree to board the ship.</p><p>Qin Sang and Gu Yun Sou stepped forward to greet the sect leader, Yu.</p><p>Yu, clad in a simple green robe, looked like a middle-aged scholar, with bright eyes that held a sharp intensity.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, Yu's eyes lit up, and he bowed. "This must be Daoist Qingfeng, the one who vanquished the corpse demon. I've heard much about you."</p><p>Qin Sang showed no false modesty.  The stronger his reputation, the more others would fear Qingyang Temple.</p><p>"I, too, have long admired Sect Leader Yu," Qin Sang responded.</p><p>"Heh, that corpse demon was incredibly ferocious and acted recklessly. He even provoked me. If I hadn't been tied up with sect matters, I would have settled the score with him that day. Your act of slaying the demon and upholding righteousness is truly gratifying! However, that corpse demon had a few accomplices who will also attend the Ji Tian Sect ceremony. You should be careful," Yu seemingly offered a well-meaning warning.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unfazed, calmly stating, "Right always prevails over evil; we will simply face whatever comes."</p><p>After slaying the ancestor of the Nether Falcon, he naturally sought to learn more about the demon.</p><p>The demon had no strong backing; his associates were mostly early Illusory Void cultivators, with no deeply connected powerful figures.</p><p>Previously, he might have been wary.</p><p>His battle with the Nether Falcon ancestor had validated his strength, and his cultivation had increased significantly afterward, rendering him fearless against any cultivator of the same realm.</p><p>Moreover, demonic cultivators were cunning and distrustful of each other, unlikely to avenge the Nether Falcon ancestor.</p><p>Yu Zongzhu was secretly surprised. He had assumed that Qin Sang was a helper brought by Gu Yunshou, and that the defeat of the冥鹘老祖 was a carefully planned achievement of Gu Yunshou.</p><p>Could it be that Gu Yunshou hadn't exaggerated?</p><p>Yu Zongzhu laughed heartily, "Daoist, you needn't worry. Those demons are selfish and self-interested; they won't do anything without gain.  If anyone dares to make trouble, we won't let them run rampant!"</p><p>"I thank you both, Daoist friends," Qin Sang smiled slightly, bowing in return.  "This isn't the place for a conversation. Zongzhu Yu, perhaps we could speak in a quieter room?"</p><p>Gu Yunshou opportunely interjected, instructing Yun Xi to settle the Guhe Garden disciples.</p><p>The three of them walked towards the quiet room.</p><p>Yu Zongzhu explained to Qin Sang, "Our sect's flying artifacts are not as good as the Cloud-Touching Ship of Yun Du Tian. Last time, outside Ji Tian Zong, we were nearly ridiculed.  This time, we'll avoid embarrassment and ride on Daoist Gu Yunshou's coattails."</p><p>Gu Yunshou smiled, "Once we meet Daoist Ying, Yu Daoist, see which you prefer – the Cloud-Touching Ship or the Shangling Palace."</p><p>"Oh? Daoist Ying will be traveling with us?" Yu Zongzhu looked at Qin Sang, then at Gu Yunshou, and said meaningfully, "Daoist friend, your plans are quite ambitious!"</p><p>After picking up the Guhe Garden cultivators, the Cloud-Touching Ship continued north.</p><p>Flying out of Yuanlan Lake, they finally saw normal land – vast forests, sparsely populated.</p><p>Along the way, the Cloud-Touching Ship occasionally altered course to visit other daoist friends, making brief stops.  This continued intermittently for three months.</p><p>Qin Sang was cultivating alone in the quiet room when he sensed the activation of the barrier at the door. Gu Yunshou's voice came through.</p><p>"Daoist, are you awake? We've reached Ji Tian Zong."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He opened the door and walked out beside Gu Yunshou, gazing towards the horizon.</p><p>A vast expanse of land, rivers crisscrossing.  Above the layered mountain shadows, thousands of beams of azure light shone dazzlingly; the sky was a clear wash of blue.</p><p>The light, substantial as if real, flowed smoothly like silk, woven into a gigantic ‘banner’ floating in the sky, stretching for countless miles.  It danced in the wind, rippling gently.</p><p>Even before reaching Ji Tian Zong, the magnificent spectacle was breathtaking – truly worthy of being the leading sect of Yue Du Bay!</p><p>Ji Tian Zong's mountain gate was hidden within the light.</p><p>As Qin Sang admired the scenery, he caught sight of a magnificent palace beside the Cloud-Touching Ship, floating on the clouds, moving alongside.  This palace was Daoist Ying's Shangling Palace.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang noticed that from time to time, beams of light would merge into the azure glow – various flying artifacts.  Each one was extraordinarily opulent, displaying the grandeur of a major sect, causing Qin Sang to marvel.</p><p>Two flying artifacts crossed countless mountain ranges and approached the light.  Instead of slowing, they accelerated, creating a tremendous spectacle.  The Cloud-Touching Ship raised a giant sail, complementing the azure light; beneath, the waves churned, as if sailing from the sea to the sky.  The Shangling Palace transformed into a magnificent divine palace; below it, the clouds shifted and changed, resembling dragons and phoenixes, or countless people thriving, displaying wondrous mysteries.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The Cloud-Touching Ship sailed into the light.</p><p>In an instant, a fantastic and beautiful sight met their eyes.  Green mountains like ink, absorbing the spiritual essence of heaven and earth, countless immortal mountains.  On the green mountains, the vegetation was lush, a scene of freshness and natural beauty.  Between the mountains, corridors connected them in an orderly fashion, a beautiful blend of green and white, accented with pale pink.  Upon closer inspection, those corridors were actually vines that stretched from one mountain to another, creating paths between them.  Green tendrils hung down, like railings; at their ends, hung flowers the size of lanterns.  Some were white, others pink, pure and elegant, blooming year-round.</p><p>"Ji Tian Zong is deep within the light; this is the outer city, where the Ji Tian Assembly is held." Gu Yunshou explained through voice transmission.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but exclaim, where did this resemble a city?  This 'city' was the collection of mountains connected by vines; people lived beneath the trees, walking the vine bridges, completely integrated with nature.</p><p>A clamor arose.  Crowds gathered on the mountaintops, commenting freely and openly on the incoming flying artifacts, their voices unrestrained.  Their laughter was even louder.</p><p>"Wow! See that flying eagle? It's made by Han Yu Shan using the corpse of a Nascent Soul-stage demon beast! Hilarious! Hilarious!"</p><p>"Huh? That Cloud-Touching Ship, the marking… it's the one Yun Du Tian just bought."</p><p>"Isn't that Shangling Palace from Shangling Academy? It hasn't been updated in years."</p><p>"Can't afford a new flying artifact? Shangling Academy, each generation worse than the last, it's clearly going downhill."</p><p>"Hahaha…"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Shangling Palace, seeing that Zongzhu Ying's face was slightly green. He didn't expect that not updating a flying artifact for years would attract such ridicule.</p>
