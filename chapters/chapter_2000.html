<h1>Chapter 1991: Heavenly River Counterattack</h1><p>Returning to the Baoyuan Estate, Qin Sang took stock of his assets, intending to leverage his previous collection for a successful showing at the upcoming auction and trade fair.</p><p>The Jitian Ceremony would open in ten days.</p><p>On the third day, the first auction on Lingbao Peak commenced.</p><p>A steward had delivered the invitation to Baoyuan Estate.  Qin Sang, along with Taiyi and Yulang, arrived as scheduled.</p><p>The auction itself was unremarkable; the highlight items held little interest for Qin Sang.</p><p>Nevertheless, he made two purchases, acquiring two treasures for Taiyi and Yulang.</p><p>He bought nothing for himself.</p><p>On the seventh day, at the second auction, Qin Sang arrived late, only to leave shortly afterward, showing little interest.</p><p>Until the night of the ninth day.</p><p>At midnight.</p><p>The Baoyuan Estate's protective barriers were triggered. Qin Sang personally went to greet the visitor, finding Gu Yunshou waiting outside.</p><p>“Daoist, your recent endeavors must have yielded a bountiful harvest?” Gu Yunshou chuckled.</p><p>Gu Yunshou had been busy with preparations for the Jitian Ceremony and Xiaodongtian, meeting with Qin Sang only once in the past few days.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang sigh, Gu Yunshou laughed heartily.</p><p>He understood that ordinary merchants and public auctions offered little benefit to cultivators of Qin Sang's level (煉虛修士).</p><p>Those individuals, while possibly lacking in cultivation, possessed discerning eyes, leaving few opportunities for advantageous finds.</p><p>“Daoist, come with me. Tonight, I assure you a satisfactory outcome!” Gu Yunshou gestured for Qin Sang to follow.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted subtly as he quickened his pace. “The trade fair is tonight?”</p><p>“Indeed. There will be several smaller gatherings later, but none compare to tonight’s in terms of participants, opportunities, and the discretion of the organizer.”</p><p>Gu Yunshou nodded, offering an explanation.</p><p>Trade fairs among high-level cultivators (煉虛修士) were traditionally held the day before or the first day of the Jitian Ceremony.</p><p>This one was scheduled accordingly, before the main event.</p><p>Tonight, most of the influential factions would be present.</p><p>From Gu Yunshou’s words, this trade fair was the most prestigious, attracting the majority of the high-level cultivators attending the Jitian Ceremony – a smaller Jitian Ceremony in itself.</p><p>The two walked side-by-side down the mountain, crossing a vine bridge, proceeding at a leisurely pace.</p><p>Gu Yunshou explained the trade fair’s proceedings to Qin Sang.</p><p>Even at midnight, the city wasn't entirely dark.</p><p>The luminous blossoms on the vines provided a soft light, scattered amongst the peaks like countless lanterns.</p><p>While not illuminating every corner, they created a serene, elegant atmosphere.</p><p>Many cultivators appreciated this ambiance, venturing out from their caves to enjoy the night scene.</p><p>As they walked, occasionally passing other cultivators, Gu Yunshou subtly concealed their figures with a spell.</p><p>They continued their conversation, now invisible to others.</p><p>Eventually, Gu Yunshou led Qin Sang to an unnamed peak, circling half its circumference before stopping at a cliff face.</p><p>The cliff's rocky surface was irregular, with three vine bridges clinging to its face.</p><p>They ascended the middle one.  Gu Yunshou counted the lanterns along the bridge, stopping at the ninth.  He whispered, “This is the place.”</p><p>He gently tapped the lantern.</p><p>The lantern trembled slightly. A lazy voice echoed from within.</p><p>“A-woo!”</p><p>The petals parted, revealing an infant, resembling a sleeping flower spirit nestled within the blossom's heart. Startled awake, it stretched languidly.</p><p>The baby, no bigger than a fist, was perfectly formed, fair-skinned, and remarkably cute. It wore a tiny red bellyband, barely concealing its private parts, which were briefly exposed during its stretch.</p><p>Unaware of its momentary exposure, the infant opened its drowsy eyes.</p><p>Gu Yunshou produced a jade pendant from his sleeve and offered it to the baby's mouth.</p><p>‘Click!’</p><p>The baby's eyes lit up. It devoured the pendant in a single bite, chewing with audible crunching sounds, clearly savoring its sweetness.</p><p>After swallowing, the infant stared wide-eyed at Qin Sang and Gu Yunshou, then used its hands and feet to climb back into the flower’s heart. The petals suddenly opened wide, like a gaping maw, engulfing Qin Sang and Gu Yunshou.</p><p>Having been warned by Gu Yunshou, Qin Sang offered no resistance. He felt himself falling into darkness, surrounded by nothingness, unsure of his location.</p><p>He stole a glance back. Darkness enveloped the area behind him, the infant vanished.  He couldn’t help but marvel at the strange event.</p><p>He had carefully observed the infant earlier, unable to discern its nature; it was unlike any flower spirit he had ever seen, a mysterious creature indeed.</p><p>Gu Yunshou noticed Qin Sang's movements and transmitted a voice message: "Master Daoist, there's no need to look.  I've seen this kind of 'Flower Infant' before, but I still don't know its origins. It must be a special creature kept by the host, possessing unique abilities to prevent disturbances at the trading fair."</p><p>Since even Gu Yunshou couldn't identify it, Qin Sang stopped trying to figure it out, thinking to himself how mysterious the host was.</p><p>As they spoke, the surroundings changed again. A soft light dispelled the darkness, and a faint mist rose around them. The ground felt soft and springy, like walking on clouds.</p><p>The space was initially empty, then lights flickered, and two pairs of stone tables and chairs appeared ahead.  Each stone table held a stone tray.</p><p>Gu Yunshou gestured for Qin Sang to sit down, then took out a jade bead about the size of a longan and placed it on a stone tray.</p><p>"To participate in the trading fair, each person must pay one spiritual treasure as a fee for a seat."</p><p>An entrance fee of a spiritual treasure was astonishing.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no other requirements; any spiritual treasure would do, regardless of its inscription; and importantly, the host didn't take a commission, which was acceptable.</p><p>Qin Sang had learned about some of the rules over the past few days.</p><p>Although spiritual treasures were rare, effective trading methods had developed over countless years.</p><p>In Yue Du Bay, spiritual treasures that had lost their owners and lacked inscriptions were still bought, although their value was greatly reduced.</p><p>Besides that, there were also merchants who sold spiritual treasures on commission, but it could take a long time to find a suitable buyer.</p><p>Then there were these trading fairs among Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Having reached the Nascent Soul stage, their abilities far surpassed those of the Yuan Ying and Transformation stages.  They didn't treat spiritual treasures the same way, not being hampered by the lack of inscriptions.</p><p>The vast world had spawned specialized techniques for handling spiritual treasures, but these techniques were uncommon and often required various conditions to use, making the subjugation of spiritual treasures far from easy.</p><p>Sometimes, the effort required to subdue a spiritual treasure was simply not worth it.</p><p>For example, Qin Sang, after killing the ancestor of the Nether Falcon, had obtained several spiritual treasures but hadn't considered subduing them. He preferred to refine them from scratch himself for a better fit.</p><p>Conversely, spiritual treasures with similar attributes and abilities to the cultivator are easier to subdue.  Cultivators usually choose such treasures, which is a kind of 'fate'.</p><p>If such a spiritual treasure appeared at this trading fair, Qin Sang would make a bid.</p><p>Following Gu Yunshou's explanation, Qin Sang selected a pair of phoenix-shaped earrings and placed them on the stone tray.</p><p>This treasure, called the "Double Phoenix Earring," was a relic of the black demonic roc.</p><p>Qin Sang had essentially obtained the relics of two Nascent Soul cultivators. Besides their personal treasures, they also had several items looted from enemies, of varying quality. The Double Phoenix Earring was among the lowest-grade ones.</p><p>Once the treasures were placed on the tray, the stone trays floated up and disappeared into the mist.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang noticed several faint glows appearing in the mist.  Within the glowing orbs, figures were vaguely visible, yet seemed to be miles away, impossible to discern clearly; quite peculiar.</p><p>More and more orbs appeared.  Those were the cultivators participating in the fair, and the trading took place in this environment.</p><p>In Yue Du Bay, Nascent Soul cultivators, to a greater or lesser extent, had heard of each other's names and knew of their deeds.</p><p>Some might wonder why they didn't simply sit together openly. This arrangement might seem unnecessarily mysterious.</p><p>Those familiar with the situation in the cultivation world knew this arrangement avoided direct conflicts between good and evil, allowing for transactions of less-than-savory items.  </p><p>The prerequisite was that the host was fair.</p><p>"Jitian Sect has gone to great lengths," Qin Sang remarked.</p><p>"You also think the host is the Jitian Sect?" Gu Yunshou asked.</p><p>"Who else could it be?  However, even this arrangement can't eliminate everyone's concerns," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"In all these years of the fair, apart from those who intentionally revealed their identities, we've never heard of anyone's identity being leaked, or of anyone facing unwarranted retribution from the Jitian Sect," Gu Yunshou transmitted.</p><p>As they spoke, more and more glowing orbs lit up in the mist.</p><p>There were no servants, no spiritual tea, or immortal fruits; everyone waited patiently.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes to rest. After an incense stick's worth of time, he suddenly sensed a disturbance in the mist.</p><p>"Ahem!"</p><p>An old voice rang out, "It's almost time. Most of you Daoists here are not attending the fair for the first time. For the newcomers, I extend a welcome.  The rules are simple, and I won't repeat them. You will each take your turn to present your treasures and state your needs. Those willing to trade will contact you. Whether you trade on the spot, make private arrangements, or trade outside, I won't interfere..."</p><p>"However, here, it is only the value of the treasures that matters, not their stories, nor any grudges you may have. I don't wish to see any conflicts here.  Of course, since the establishment of the trading fair, there have never been any conflicts."</p><p>The tone remained calm, but everyone felt a chill when they heard the last sentence.</p><p>Qin Sang unconsciously sat up straighter, trying to pinpoint the source of the voice to no avail. It seemed to come from all directions.</p><p>He decided against awakening the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The host paused, then asked, "Which cultivator will go first?"</p><p>"Old man will go first."</p><p>A raspy voice echoed from one of the glowing orbs.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou shook his head at Qin Sang, indicating he couldn't identify the speaker.</p><p>The orb brightened slightly, then three beams of light shot out, hovering amidst the other orbs. A blade, a long flute, and a pair of cymbals materialized, clearly visible.</p><p>"Of these three treasures, only the feathered flute possesses the 'Treasure-Passing' spell. Any cultivator interested can exchange treasures for it."</p><p>"Furthermore, I only seek one thing: a piece of Hanhai Mingyu weighing seven liang or more."</p><p>Before the words were finished, waves of spiritual senses swept towards the treasures.</p><p>As Qin Sang perceived the treasures' properties, he heard someone from a nearby orb say, "Hanhai Mingyu is only produced in the Shenyu Sea, a second-rank jade on its Hundred Jade Ranking. It rarely appears, and a piece weighing seven liang or more is an extremely rare treasure. What are you offering in exchange?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the orb.</p><p>As a refiner, he naturally prioritized investigating special materials nearby.</p><p>The Shenyu Sea, east of the Yue Du Bay, was renowned for producing various spirit jades, and it had a Hundred Jade Ranking.</p><p>Only three jades were ranked first-class.</p><p>Six were second-class, all extraordinary rarities.</p><p>It was said that many Shenyu Sea cultivators relied on spirit jades for their cultivation, hence the scarcity of those available.</p><p>The person chuckled, "I possess many treasures, but it's inconvenient to display them publicly. If you can provide the Hanhai Mingyu, I'll do my best to fulfill any condition you name."</p><p>The two then fell silent, presumably engaging in private communication.</p><p>Soon, the feathered flute was exchanged for another treasure, while the remaining two, lacking the 'Treasure-Passing' spell, remained untouched.</p><p>The parties negotiating for the Hanhai Mingyu remained quiet, their agreement unknown.</p><p>Then, someone from a nearby orb spoke.</p><p>"I have a Thousand-Leaf Immortal Sunflower…"</p><p>The trade proceeded smoothly.  All were powerful cultivators; the host didn't need to maintain order.</p><p>Qin Sang was fascinated, though he hadn't found any treasure he desired.  He was interested in several materials, however.</p><p>His priority was his cultivation, so he wasn't in a rush to trade.</p><p>One by one, it soon became Qin Sang and Gu Yun Sou's turn.</p><p>Qin Sang felt many eyes on him.  His thoughts flickered, and several beams of light shot out from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Each contained a treasure, including the Everbright Lamp, the Yan Hun Lamp, used by the ancestor of the Nether Falcon Clan.</p><p>This was a treasure highly valued by the Nether Falcon ancestor, ranking among the best present.</p><p>The other two were comparable to, even surpassing, the Yan Hun Lamp, being remnants of the black demonic peng.</p><p>With the three treasures revealed, Gu Yun Sou was slightly moved, his resolve to ally with Qin Sang strengthened.</p><p>"My request is for a method to draw upon the power of the stars, to gather starlight and bring it down to the mortal realm.  This could be a treasure, array, talisman, technique, or even a cultivation method focused on this."</p><p>The appearance of the Yan Hun Lamp caused a subtle stir in the crowd, but Qin Sang seemed oblivious, stating his request in a low voice.</p><p>After a brief silence, whispers began to fill the air.</p><p>Many were inquiring about the price of the treasures.</p><p>Sadly, no one could meet Qin Sang's needs.</p><p>Just as he felt disheartened, a sharp voice cut through the air.</p><p>"Heh, wasn't the old zombie Nether Falcon killed by you?"</p><p>Qin Sang neither confirmed nor denied, coldly saying, "What do you mean?  Do you intend to avenge that fiend?"</p><p>"Haha…"</p><p>The sharp laughter was almost ear-piercing.  "That old zombie's demise is a cause for celebration. I'm interested in a powerful secret technique he possessed, which should have fallen into your hands."</p><p>The speaker was likely referring to the 'Life and Death Reversal' technique, a peak secret technique of the Corpse Ghost Path.  It was incredibly difficult to cultivate, but despite its power, Qin Sang could only admire it from afar.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou's eyes lit up, a thought striking him.</p><p>"This person must be Zhen Lao Mo from Wanluo Island. When the Nether Falcon ancestor returned from a trip, news of a powerful technique he acquired mysteriously leaked.  It was likely Zhen Lao Mo who spread it.  It seems they engaged in a dispute back then…"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s continued silence, the other party couldn’t help but speak. "I know of a celestial array called the Heavenly River Reverse Killing Array, a killing array of the Stellar Path, but I don't possess it.  Give me that secret technique, and I will help you acquire the array."</p>
