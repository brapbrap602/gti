<h1>Chapter 1808: Flower Field</h1><p>Passing through auspicious clouds, they entered the Golden Palace area.</p><p>The three moved without pause, led by Qing Dan Yuanjun, swiftly flying towards one of the Golden Palaces, disappearing in an instant.</p><p>Shortly after, the three reappeared in another Golden Palace, gazing back at the place they had just vanished from.</p><p>It remained perfectly calm, with no other figures in sight.</p><p>"No one is following us.  The Daoist Court and Gui Fang are preoccupied elsewhere,"</p><p>said Boxian Shanren.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. He had already confirmed through his Sky-Eyed Butterfly that no one was tracking them.</p><p>After advancing to the fifth transformation, unless it was a Nascent Soul-stage demon king or a demon marquis with special abilities, it was difficult to escape the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's detection.</p><p>"Let's wait a little longer," said Qing Dan Yuanjun cautiously. The illusions here were her meticulous work.</p><p>After waiting for another hour, and confirming there was no one, the three finally moved, silently arriving before the Nine-curve Star River, and crossing it.</p><p>Without the raging golden light, the space deep within the altar was stable.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun guided the two through the cloud paths, but soon they could go no further and had to forcibly pass through several illusions.</p><p>"Sir Qin's strength in physical cultivation surpasses ours. For some of the areas ahead, we may rely on your assistance…"</p><p>Before one of the illusions, Qing Dan Yuanjun stopped and addressed Qin Sang.</p><p>In some illusions, physical cultivators were far more adept than those who practiced spells, and Qin Sang could save them a great deal of effort.</p><p>"In that case, let this humble cultivator lead the way," Qin Sang said.</p><p>The Auspicious Seal and the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal appeared in succession. Qin Sang's blood surged, and his skin took on a pale golden hue.</p><p>At the same time, his hands burst forth with blue and red light, as he donned a pair of gauntlets.</p><p>The gauntlets were mostly composed of fine blue scales, with three bone spurs extending from each knuckle.</p><p>The bloody bone spurs were razor-sharp, radiating an eerie light, causing a stinging sensation in the eyes.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanren's pupils constricted, secretly marveling at what they knew to be a top-tier weapon.</p><p>Over the past decade, Qin Sang had finally completed the gauntlets with Master Qi’s help.</p><p>Even if Master Gu were to judge them, the craftsmanship might be considered slightly rough, but the quality of the materials was excellent, and most importantly, they incorporated the bone spurs meticulously refined by Li Hou for many years, giving the gauntlets the power of a pseudo-spiritual treasure.</p><p>The process of forging the gauntlets was also a process of integrating Qin Sang's knowledge and experience.  Coupled with his study of the refining texts given by Master Gu, he had made rapid progress in the art of refinement.</p><p>In the future, given the time, Qin Sang would continue refining the Huifeng Armor and the gauntlets, these two treasures serving not only as a testament to his refining skills, but also as a mark of his continuing progress.</p><p>Qin Sang took the lead, with Qing Dan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanren following behind, flanking him and prepared for anything.</p><p>Maintaining this formation, the three successively passed through numerous illusions.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Above, no sky; below, no earth.</p><p>An all-pervading, soul-corroding black wind howled.</p><p>Three figures flew precariously through the wind.</p><p>This was a strange spiritual wind that could dissipate spiritual energy, greatly reducing the effectiveness of protective treasures, making them hard pressed against the wind’s onslaught.</p><p>Qin Sang's robust physique remained unaffected, while Qing Dan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanren struggled to resist the wind's force.</p><p>After traveling through the endless black wind for an unknown length of time, light finally appeared ahead, and the three immediately sped up.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Finally escaping the spiritual wind, Qing Dan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanren showed expressions of relief.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the surrounding environment, his expression shifting.</p><p>Because of the different route, the illusions they encountered this time were completely different from the last, and he saw a familiar sight.</p><p>At the edge of their vision, amongst countless strange scenes, there was a small patch of blue, much like the blue sea of light he had seen before.</p><p>It was clear that the blue sea of light was very far away, but they could use it to determine their direction.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then asked Qing Dan Yuanjun with some doubt, "Can we reach the Poisonous Region from here?"</p><p>Judging from the blue sea of light, this direction was far too different from where they had appeared last time, which was hard to ignore.</p><p>"This is an old path explored by my ancestors of the Mole Cricket Mountain. While it has many difficulties, if we are careful, it generally poses no threat to our lives," Qing Dan Yuanjun raised a jade finger, pointing to the right, "After discovering the Poisonous Region, I found a shortcut, but…"</p><p>Boxian Shanren sighed lightly, "That shortcut passes through the area disputed by the Daoist Court and Gui Fang. It's better to take the longer, safer route."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred. The chaos of the golden light had clearly not yet ended.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun carefully identified their location, her expression relaxing slightly, "There are no changes ahead.  Sir Qin can rest for a while. The two illusions after this, we two can handle."</p><p>As they spoke, they reached Qin Sang.</p><p>Thus they rotated, the three traversing illusions one after another.</p><p>The deeper they ventured into the altar, the more perilous the illusions became.  They were forced to slow their pace, proceeding in fits and starts.</p><p>Finally, a green lake appeared before them.</p><p>"Friend, is this the poisonous domain you spoke of?"</p><p>Qin Sang approached the lakeshore, gazing at the water with a curious expression.</p><p>The lake was quite wide, but compared to the other illusions, it seemed small, squeezed between two illusions stretching for hundreds of miles, appearing almost cramped, like an abrupt well in the landscape.</p><p>The lake's surface was a perfectly regular circle, but strangely sloped, the incline quite steep. Their position was at the lowest point, as if facing a tilted mirror.</p><p>The green water offered no sign of life.</p><p>The lake was extremely deep, the water a near-black, deep green, giving a profoundly dangerous feeling.</p><p>"It's quite a good passage; through this poisonous lake, we should reach much deeper,"</p><p>Qin Sang observed the surroundings, thinking to himself.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun stared at the poisonous lake, explaining: "This is the place.  According to our sect's records, the lake water used to be clear, normal water, without any poison.  The sudden change to poisonous water isn't unusual here in the altar; this place is constantly shifting. If that golden light were to erupt several more times, the entire altar might be unrecognizable…"</p><p>As she spoke, a crimson light appeared on Qing Dan Yuanjun's brow, shooting out a talismans of extreme complexity.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun clearly understood this talisman perfectly.  As soon as it appeared, a dazzling red light filled the air.</p><p>In an instant, the talisman transformed into a crimson robe, flying towards Qing Dan Yuanjun.</p><p>The robe was exquisitely made, richly adorned with two unknown mythical birds, resembling spirit beasts attending her.</p><p>Wearing it, she seemed even more regal.</p><p>Bo Xian Shanren took out a jade pendant, placing it in his mouth, and said to Qin Sang: "The surface poison water shouldn't be underestimated; be very careful, True Person. Once through the poison water, the danger will lessen. The inside of the poisonous lake is very peculiar; it's hard to explain, I'll tell you as we go."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, his body radiating a seven-colored light, merging with his skin to form golden armor, appearing even more radiant.</p><p>Bo Xian Shanren and Qing Dan Yuanjun couldn't discern what kind of supernatural power or treasure Qin Sang was using, secretly marveling, but understanding this must be Qin Sang's secret, they didn't inquire.</p><p>They entered the poisonous lake.</p><p>Qin Sang heard the rushing water and felt the strong current flowing past him.</p><p>However, through his poison pearl, he sensed that the strange water was not actually very poisonous; the poison pearl couldn't absorb it.</p><p>Just as he was puzzled, he noticed ripples forming in the water ahead.  There were no whirlpools; the ripples appeared out of nowhere, moving towards him.</p><p>"Careful,"</p><p>Bo Xian Shanren warned, as the first ripple reached Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A wave of water washed over Qin Sang; the force was gentle, not pushing him back.</p><p>The moment he touched the ripple, Qin Sang's vision filled with a deep green, and he felt something strange.</p><p>He raised his arms, and found that, almost instantly, his body was covered in green spots, densely packed.</p><p>As more ripples arrived, the spots grew larger, bulging like bubbles before bursting.</p><p>‘Pop pop pop…’</p><p>The popping sounds continued; small green poisonous plants burst forth, forming a thick carpet over Qin Sang, as if he had been submerged for a long time, covered in aquatic weeds.</p><p>Soon, the weeds sprouted buds.</p><p>Green poisonous flowers bloomed, transforming Qin Sang into a field of flowers.</p><p>"The water itself is not poisonous.  It must be some unknown formation or restriction, using the water to cultivate these poisonous flowers. The flowers aren't real; it's very strange…"</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun and Bo Xian Shanren were unfazed, continuing their journey.</p><p>As they moved, green flowers drifted from their bodies, leaving a trail of flowers, quite beautiful.</p><p>They didn't mention the consequences of having these flowers bloom inside them. Qin Sang didn't want to find out; his anti-poison armor kept the flowers out, and he followed closely.</p><p>The flowers grew faster than they fell.</p><p>As they proceeded, the three were enveloped in layers of flowers, appearing like three buoyant spheres of flowers floating on the water.</p><p>"We'll be through the poisonous water soon, True Person. How are you feeling?"</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun asked with concern.</p><p>"Fine," Qin Sang replied calmly.</p><p>The flowers were far from overwhelming his anti-poison armor.  If he couldn't even pass the outer layer of poisonous water, he might as well turn back.</p><p>Soon, the foremost cluster of flowers began to rapidly wither and fall, revealing Qingdan Yuanjun's figure.</p><p>Bo Xian and Qin Sang then appeared.</p><p>Before them lay an endless expanse of green mist.</p><p>The mist, cloud-like, drifted in the void. There was no wind, and its movement was erratic.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, seeing the poisonous water forming a green canopy above.  The surrounding mist appeared sparse, yet it blocked spiritual sense exploration.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly could see farther, but even it couldn't perceive an end; it seemed boundless.</p><p>The internal space of the poisonous lake far exceeded their expectations.</p><p>"The mist and the outer poisonous water are the same color," Qingdan Yuanjun transmitted, "but we haven't yet found any inherent threat from the mist itself.  The danger comes from elsewhere.  Remember, don't spread your spiritual sense too far…"</p><p>Identifying their direction, she flew forward.</p><p>They moved through the mist like they were riding clouds.</p><p>The danger Qingdan Yuanjun mentioned never appeared; everything seemed peaceful.</p><p>Using the Tianmu Butterfly's abilities, Qin Sang carefully observed the surroundings, finding nothing unusual.  Compared to other illusions created by spiritual abilities, this place was remarkably calm.</p><p>Shortly after, a dense patch of mist appeared in the Tianmu Butterfly's field of vision.  This patch was exceptionally thick, drifting among the other mist and slowly approaching them.</p><p>The others sensed it soon after the Tianmu Butterfly.</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun's expression turned serious. She immediately yielded the path to the mist, suspending her movement, and sternly warned, "Do not leak your aura!"</p><p>Qin Sang complied, standing behind Qingdan Yuanjun, watching the direction from which the mist was coming.  She wondered what was inside, something that made the two masters so wary even before it neared.</p><p>As the mist drew closer, the Tianmu Butterfly finally saw what was within.</p><p>Strangely, inside the mist was a bubble, with the poisonous mist swirling around it.  The bubble was transparent, and inside was a patch of land!</p><p>To be precise, it was a flower field.</p><p>The field was filled with spiritual flowers, a sea of blossoms swaying gently, a vibrant riot of color, incredibly vivid.</p><p>Even from behind the bubble, those who saw the flower sea felt a sense of delight, as if they could smell the refreshing fragrance.  The spiritual flowers were unlike any they had ever seen, seemingly created out of thin air.</p><p>The mist passed by them.</p><p>The beautiful flower field remained unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Qingdan Yuanjun with a questioning glance.  Qingdan Yuanjun transmitted, "Follow!"</p><p>They followed the mist, slowly flying deeper into its depths.</p><p>After a while, a change occurred within the flower field. Qingdan Yuanjun softly said, "It's coming."</p><p>Her voice held a hint of fear.</p><p>The spiritual flowers in the field began swaying with sudden speed, the entire sea of flowers seeming to go mad.  All the flowers were violently spraying their stamens outward, the stamens intertwining in the air, along with pollen-like smoke.</p><p>In an instant, flower cocoons floated above the field.</p><p>The next moment, the cocoons cracked open.</p><p>Seeing the contents of the cocoons, surprise flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.  They were human-shaped flower spirits.</p><p>The flower spirits were male and female, all extremely beautiful.</p><p>Their movements were surprisingly uniform, all sitting cross-legged, gazing at the sky.</p><p>Then, they stood up from the cracks in the cocoons, stepping on the stamens, and walking to the ground. The beautiful flowers, the delicate spirits—the scene was strangely unsettling.</p><p>Their eyes were vacant and deep, their expressions emotionless, as if controlled by some unseen force.  Reaching the ground, they began pairing off and dancing in the flower field.</p><p>There was no music, and the flower spirits’ gazes remained empty as they looked at their partners.</p><p>Watching their graceful dance, the three felt a chilling dread.</p><p>"The first time I came here, I sent out a strand of spiritual sense to see what else was in the flower field, to see if the flower spirits were real," Qingdan Yuanjun recounted, her voice still laced with fear. "But the moment my aura leaked, all the flower spirits froze, staring at me in unison…"</p><p>She was still terrified remembering the instant she felt the danger, barely escaping before they could pursue her.</p><p>The flower spirits danced for the time it takes to burn an incense stick before returning to their cocoons.</p><p>The cocoons closed, retracting the stamens, and the flower spirits seemed to fall asleep.</p><p>Everything happened silently.</p><p>They quietly followed behind the mist, encountering another patch, another flower field, only of a different size.</p><p>Then Qingdan Yuanjun abandoned pursuit, changing course.</p><p>After flying for a while, a different sight finally appeared in the mist ahead—an ancient palace.</p><p>"The thing I seek is in that palace," Qingdan Yuanjun breathed a sigh of relief.  As agreed, she produced a jade slip and handed it to Qin Sang. "This contains half of a cultivation technique.  Once you obtain the treasure, I’ll give you the other half."</p>
