<h1>Chapter 1609: Transcendence and Legacy</h1><p>“Someone emerged from the thunder!”</p><p>“A person? Am I seeing things?”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>…</p><p>Screams erupted from the treasure ships.</p><p>Many aboard had witnessed Su Zinan opening the Wuwang Palace; they knew firsthand that the thunder’s power was even more terrifying than the Gray Tide of that time.</p><p>A single bolt of lightning could obliterate them.</p><p>Fortunately, they were at sea.  If this were on land, the mountains below would have been riddled with holes and completely collapsed.</p><p>Who could survive such thunder?</p><p>The sound of the waves disappeared, completely drowned out by the thunder.  Above, it seemed as if a hole had opened in the sky, lightning raining down incessantly, growing denser and denser. Then, the sea of thunder began to expand outwards.</p><p>“Quick! Flee!”</p><p>Someone screamed in terror.</p><p>The approaching thunder brought the scent of death.</p><p>Several treasure ships, choosing any escape route, activated their formations to the fullest. They darted between the waves, tossed about by the wind and rain, desperately fleeing.</p><p>These weren’t ordinary merchant ships; they were controlled by cultivators.  The treasure ships were of decent quality and hadn’t yet been swallowed by the waves and capsized.</p><p>However, one ship was too close to the thunder. Its speed couldn't match the thunder's expansion, and it was engulfed by countless lightning bolts.</p><p>There were no screams.</p><p>Not even the sound of the ship’s protective barrier breaking.</p><p>When the others looked back, they only saw a dazzling silver light. In the blink of an eye, the treasure ship had vanished.</p><p>No one escaped; all perished with the ship.</p><p>And this ship had a Golden Core cultivator on board!</p><p>Panic spread.</p><p>At this moment, there was no joy left. Even if it was truly the Wuwang Palace appearing, it was too dangerous; even Nascent Soul cultivators would perish within.</p><p>Everyone was too busy escaping to pay attention to the sky.</p><p>The cataclysm was only just beginning. Within the thunder, an immense amount of thunder power gathered, forming a silvery thunder ring.  The inside and outside of the ring were filled with violent lightning.</p><p>Outside the ring was the raging wind and waves, the boundless ocean.</p><p>Inside the ring, however, was a connection to another space.</p><p>This space was filled with destruction. Lightning never ceased, its brilliance blinding, obscuring the scene within.</p><p>Occasionally, gaps appeared in the lightning.  Only then could glimpses be caught of a corner of the deeper space.</p><p>There were rolling mountains and ancient palaces like a forest.</p><p>One could imagine a heavenly scene.</p><p>But now, the beauty was destroyed by lightning, transformed into a thunder abyss. Even the remaining ancient immortal formations were on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Besides the lightning, wave after wave of gray tide swept across the heavens and earth.</p><p>In this hellish environment, people existed, and more than one!</p><p>Inside the thunder ring, two figures hovered in the air, one on each side.</p><p>This is what the people on the treasure ships saw.</p><p>Surrounded by lightning, their true appearances were obscured.  They looked like two human-shaped bolts of lightning, forcefully pushing against the lightning and gray tide, encountering powerful resistance.</p><p>Their goal was to escape this space, to reach beyond the thunder ring!</p><p>At that moment, amidst the earth-shattering thunder, chanting and a high-pitched shriek could be heard.  The sounds weren't loud, yet they pierced through the thunder.</p><p>The chanting came from the figure on the left.</p><p>As time passed, the chanting grew stronger. The lightning around this person was gradually replaced by golden Buddha light, spreading outwards.</p><p>The shriek came from the figure on the right. A green light, like a green sword, pierced through the lightning within.</p><p>The two exerted themselves, displaying incredible power. The Buddha light and green light erupted simultaneously, piercing the thunder ring.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The thunder ring shone brightly, then suddenly dimmed, cracking open.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, the two figures burst out of the ring, returning to the present world. They transformed into one golden and one green streak of light, instantly escaping the range of the thunder.</p><p>After their escape, the external lightning didn't subside; instead, it intensified. The broken thunder ring showed no signs of repairing itself, exhibiting clear instability.</p><p>The ring cracked into several pieces, the fragments not rejoining, but separating and expanding.</p><p>From the breaks, stronger and more violent thunder power escaped, bringing an apocalyptic end to the entire sea region.</p><p>However, the most violent change was within the thunder ring.</p><p>As the ring tore apart, the internal space seemed to lose some kind of constraint, gradually returning to the present world, causing spatial tremors and even more astonishing celestial phenomena.</p><p>The cultivators fleeing on their treasure ships sensed something and turned their heads, shocked by the sight in the sky.</p><p>A magnificent immortal palace faintly appeared in mid-air.</p><p>The palace was not connected to the heavens or the earth, slowly 'growing' out of the void.</p><p>Mountains resembled crouching dragons, revealing a glimpse of their icy peaks, ancient palaces and immortal mansions emerging into existence.</p><p>“Wu Wang Palace!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Only Wu Wang Palace could possess such imposing aura.  The Daoist and Buddhist sects, along with Su Zi Nan, had previously entered Wu Wang Palace, finding only fragments. Now, they witnessed the true form of this ancient immortal sect!</p><p>The protective barriers of Wu Wang Palace flashed repeatedly.  Under the onslaught of incredibly violent thunder and a grey tide, the barriers flickered and died, each extinguished section signifying the destruction of an immortal hall.</p><p>Wu Wang Palace was already riddled with holes, little more than ruins, teetering on the brink of annihilation.  Now, things worsened.  As the remaining ancient halls crumbled, the mountain began to collapse, threatening the entire immortal estate!</p><p>Before everyone's eyes, the immortal estate rose and fell in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Space filled with thunder and the grey tide, pulverizing the fragments of the estate until it was reduced to dust.</p><p>Two people escaped, gazing at the scene behind them in silent contemplation.</p><p>One was an old monk with white eyebrows and beard.  His face was deeply wrinkled, and he wore an old kasaya, his hands clasped around prayer beads. He looked like a very old man, yet his eyes were exceptionally bright, penetrating and insightful.</p><p>“Amitabha,” the monk chanted a Buddhist invocation, witnessing the destruction of the immortal estate.</p><p>Beside him stood a captivating woman.  Her figure was alluring, her face exquisitely beautiful, her eyes as luminous as water.  A single glance could captivate anyone.  Her every movement was charming, effortless, and natural.</p><p>This woman was clearly not human; three fluffy fox tails sprouted from her back, yet they didn't look out of place, adding to her unique allure.</p><p>“Wu Wang Palace is utterly destroyed.  What a pity. So many treasures, including many important artifacts of my clan, were left behind,” she sighed and lamented, her voice equally enchanting.</p><p>The monk, unmoved by the woman’s beauty, gazed at the familiar world and sighed, “I never expected to be trapped in Wu Wang Palace for three hundred years! No wonder Lu Lao Mo, after finding Wu Wang Palace, repeatedly hesitated and avoided entering the core of the immortal estate.  Thanks to your invaluable assistance, friend; otherwise, I would have likely perished while undergoing tribulation within Wu Wang Palace!”</p><p>“We’re all in the same boat.  I had to look out for myself.”</p><p>“I apologize for implicating you,”</p><p>said the monk sincerely.</p><p>The woman crossed her arms, accentuating her ample bosom, and said lazily, “It's not entirely your fault, old monk. Who could have foreseen the sudden appearance of the Heavenly Dao's ominous sound, catching us both off guard and severely wounding us? Otherwise, even if we couldn't break the core ancient prohibitions, we wouldn't have been trapped in Wu Wang Palace for three hundred years…”</p><p>She looked around, her expression grave. “The Heavenly Dao's ominous sound hasn't disappeared.  It wasn't the power of Wu Wang Palace; it's a celestial upheaval!”</p><p>“The Heavenly Dao's ominous sound!”</p><p>The monk murmured the words, his usually calm expression showing ripples. He looked towards the South Sea, “Back then, the South Sea Immortal Palace ascended. Daoist Dan Yu went too deep and couldn't retreat in time, getting swept away by the palace.  I was fortunate to have reacted quickly, but I didn’t expect the palace to trigger a celestial upheaval, turning us into trapped beasts…That might have been our last chance for ascension.”</p><p>“Ascension really?”</p><p>The woman looked unconvinced,  “That old geezer is still missing, dead or alive! Lu Lao Mo, on the other hand, was lucky. He went to the Gui Xu before the upheaval; he's probably found the Waymark Gate and escaped.”</p><p>“Whether it's truly a Heavenly Dao upheaval remains to be seen. It’s just our speculation; further verification is needed.”</p><p>said the monk cautiously.</p><p>“What's there to verify? Just look at them,”</p><p>The woman pointed towards the sea, selecting a particular treasure ship, and lightly curled a finger.</p><p>The treasure ship was struggling against the wind and waves, trying to escape.  Suddenly, the seawater beneath it surged, erupting into a massive column of water that lifted the entire ship out of the sea and into the air.</p><p>Finally, the ship was enveloped in a bubble of water and floated before the two.</p><p>The cultivators in the cabin, caught off guard by the sudden change, looked around in confusion and fear, then froze, their eyes wide.</p><p>Regardless of gender, their eyes didn’t rest on the monk, only the woman.</p><p>The woman’s fox tails swayed gently, the fur at the tips vibrating as if to arouse them, making them feel an irresistible itch.</p><p>“Golden Core late stage,” the woman glanced at a cultivator in white.</p><p>The cultivator's composure, his pride, crumbled under her gaze, his face flushed.  Only one thought filled his mind – *She looked at me!*</p><p>“He is unaffected by the Heavenly Dao's ominous sound; Yuan Ying cultivators are likely the same.”</p><p>Only those of us who are at the peak of cultivation can sense the celestial secrets and ‘hear’ the demonic sounds of Heaven!</p><p>The woman was annoyed.  “It seems the celestial upheaval won't be limited to the Central Plains; it will likely engulf the entire realm! Even if this isn't a celestial anomaly of this realm, but the work of someone behind the scenes, such terrifying power is indistinguishable from Heaven itself to us. As long as the demonic sounds persist, whether we can reach the Return Void is questionable, let alone ascension! ”</p><p>Finally, she gritted her teeth, “Without becoming immortals, we are but ants!”</p><p>The old monk paused, then said, “There are differences. If it’s not a celestial anomaly, the demonic sounds may one day cease their incessant madness and become clear enough for communication. They may no longer relentlessly assault our minds. If the change is caused by the ascension of the Immortal Palace, continued investigation into the South Sea Immortal Palace might reveal the cause.”</p><p>“I remember you said that, since records began, the Wuwang Palace was the first to control the South Sea Immortal Palace. Who was next?”</p><p>“After the Wuwang Palace was destroyed in a brutal civil war caused by the conflict between humans and demons, the South Sea Immortal Palace was ownerless until the Wuxiang Immortal Sect rose in the Southern Frontier.  We must start with the Wuxiang Immortal Sect…” The old monk, intimately familiar with the history, recounted the various forces that had controlled the South Sea Immortal Palace through the ages.</p><p>The woman sneered, “Wasn’t the Wuxiang Immortal Sect wiped out by you all?”</p><p>The old monk, seemingly oblivious to her sarcasm, said, “The Wuxiang Immortal Sect's downfall stemmed from demonic chaos, when a savage ancient demon was released from the Immortal Palace. The demon originated from the Palace, and the Palace's ascension triggered the celestial upheaval. The demonic sounds may be related to the ancient demon!  The sect's mountain gate disappeared into the unknown, leaving behind its unknown location; their records might hold the answers."</p><p>“An ancient demon capable of triggering a celestial upheaval is beyond the capacity of a mere sect like Wuxiang to suppress!”</p><p>The woman was skeptical of the old monk's plan.  Remembering the scholar in white who had been ignored, she asked, “Have any Immortal Palaces descended upon the South Sea in the last three hundred years?”</p><p>“Immortal Palace?”</p><p>The scholar in white was bewildered, unable to recall any such significant event. Yet, eager to impress the woman, he became frantic.</p><p>The woman’s smile vanished, her expression turning cold. With a backhand strike, she attacked the treasure ship.</p><p>With a thunderous boom, the protective barrier shattered.</p><p>A phantom handprint rapidly expanded in everyone's vision.</p><p>Only at the moment of death did the people aboard finally awaken from their stupor, their faces filled with terror.</p><p>Screams erupted from the ship.</p><p>Suddenly, a golden light enveloped the ship, deflecting the handprint and gently lowering it onto the sea.  Faint chanting echoed in their ears, causing everyone to lapse into a drowsy state, collapsing to the ground, their recent ordeal forgotten.</p><p>The woman glanced at the old monk, her expression unchanged, unconcerned with this minor incident.</p><p>The old monk flicked his sleeve, sending out several beams of light. “Although three hundred years have passed, time hasn't been wasted. These treasures will be invaluable in the future. How do you intend to dispose of them?”</p><p>The woman unceremoniously took two, her gaze falling on the remaining two beams of light – a square cauldron and a strange multicolored pill.</p><p>“These human artifacts; you may keep them. But you must have my permission before using them!”</p><p>The old monk agreed, and retracted them into his sleeve.  Suddenly, his face turned a sickly yellow, his breathing became ragged, and his aura fluctuated wildly. He clasped his hands together, silently reciting a scripture before regaining his composure.</p><p>Once he had recovered, the woman asked, perplexed, “The demonic sounds of Heaven constantly affect us.  You risked injury, unafraid of harming your cultivation base even further. Why act so rashly when we can escape unscathed in five years? We’ve been trapped here for three hundred years.  Why the rush?”</p><p>The old monk gazed towards the north, in the direction of Jinyu Prefecture, “The Ullambana Festival is approaching.”</p><p>“The Ullambana Festival?”</p><p>The woman paused, remembering the human festival held every five hundred years, pondering, “You think the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect will appear then?  Heh, with high-level cultivators disappearing, if we don’t show ourselves soon, the world will fall into chaos.  For them, this is a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. It'll help us find the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's mountain gate. A clever scheme…”</p><p>“That is one reason.”</p><p>The old monk glanced back, seeing that the storm had subsided, and the Wuwang Palace completely erased from existence, without a trace.</p><p>He set off towards Jinyu Prefecture.  “The journey to the Return Void is perilous, and life or death uncertain. Before I go, I must eliminate the hidden malice.”</p><p>The woman, incredulous, stared at the old monk,  “You’re barely holding on, yet you're still preoccupied with that dilapidated Chan temple? If we fail to ascend, we’ll perish.  The demonic sounds have blocked the path of cultivation in this realm; perhaps not even peak cultivators can achieve ascension. Even if your sect's legacy spans millennia, what's the point?”</p><p>“Amitabha! The legacy itself is the point.”</p><p>The old monk flew north, his steps unwavering.</p><p>“My sect forged me, and I shall forge my sect!”</p>
