<h1>Chapter 440: The Truewater Mirage Formation</h1><p>A meteor streaked across the night sky, hurtling towards the Chaotic Isles.</p><p>All present were Foundation Establishment cultivators with sharp eyesight, clearly seeing the meteor's resemblance to a flying sword.</p><p>Judging by its momentum, the sword's owner was undoubtedly a Core Formation master!</p><p>However, it remained unknown whether this was an ally or an enemy from the Heavenly Firmament Alliance.</p><p>A murmur spread through the crowd, whispers exchanged in hushed tones.</p><p>With so many Core Formation masters gathered in the Small Cold Realm, even the main and vice island lords of Stargazing Island had mobilized.  Logically, they shouldn't have been so easily defeated, unless the Heavenly Firmament Alliance had deployed a Nascent Soul master.</p><p>A voice boomed before the figure appeared.</p><p>"All False Core disciples! Come forth!"</p><p>The voice, resounding like thunder, drowned out the sound of the flying sword, echoing from afar.</p><p>Expressions of relief appeared, followed by joyous shouts: "It's Elder Di! It's Elder Di's voice! Not an enemy from the Heavenly Firmament Alliance!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed the sound and located its source among the disciples of the Yuan Mirage Sect.</p><p>The newcomer was a Core Formation master from the Yuan Mirage Sect.</p><p>However, it was unclear why Elder Di had summoned the False Core cultivators.</p><p>Could it be that the battle ahead was so fierce that it required the support of False Core disciples?</p><p>Qin Sang worried silently.  After the False Core cultivators, it would be the turn of the late Foundation Establishment cultivators like himself.  In this place, there was no chance of escape.</p><p>Teng Zhaogang also furrowed his brow.  He wouldn't dare disobey the order.  With a barely perceptible sigh, he turned and said, "Junior Brother Qin, Junior Brother Zhan, I'll leave this to you for now."</p><p>"Rest assured, Senior Brother Teng!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Zhan Yi cupped their hands in respect, watching as Teng Zhaogang flew out of the crowd on his sword, joining several other False Core masters to greet Elder Di in the sky.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Elder Di arrived above the Chaotic Isles on his flying sword.</p><p>The sword's light vanished abruptly, the sword itself disappearing as it was retrieved by a middle-aged man.</p><p>To the naked eye, there was nothing unusual about Elder Di's appearance after the battle.  His eyes and facial expression were both placid, as if unmoved.</p><p>Clearly, he was someone who concealed his emotions, a deeply calculating individual.</p><p>However, Qin Sang keenly noticed the tattered edge of Elder Di's robe!</p><p>Elder Di hovered in the air, his gaze settling on the few False Core disciples.  He nodded slightly, then waved his right hand.  Several disc-shaped objects flew from his palm and landed before Teng Zhaogang and the others.</p><p>"This is the Truewater Mirage Formation, one of my Yuan Mirage Sect's most powerful formations.  Refine these artifacts quickly and assist me in deploying it!"</p><p>Elder Di made no effort to conceal his voice, allowing everyone behind to hear clearly.</p><p>Upon hearing the name Truewater Mirage Formation, Qin Sang couldn't help but look at the discs.</p><p>The Yuan Mirage Sect was the sect most proficient in formations within the Small Cold Realm.  He had heard of the Truewater Mirage Formation's reputation before; it was said to rank among the top formations of the Yuan Mirage Sect.</p><p>Judging from the intricate artifacts, the formation's power was undoubtedly formidable.</p><p>The core of the formation required Elder Di's personal control, while the discs in Teng Zhaogang's and the others' hands served only as auxiliary components.</p><p>Qin Sang was not skilled in formations, having seen only a few sets of artifacts.  The most powerful one was the Four Clouds Divine Restriction that Zhao Yan had possessed in the Yuan Zhao Sect.  The Four Clouds Divine Restriction consisted of only four spirit banners and a piece of warm jade as the formation's core.  The complexity of the Truewater Mirage Formation far surpassed it.</p><p>A bold voice inquired, "Elder Di, why deploy the formation in the Chaotic Isles?  Are we planning a decisive battle against the Heavenly Firmament Alliance here?"</p><p>Elder Di swept his gaze over the crowd, pondered for a moment, then announced, "There's no harm in telling you.  The Island Lord has decided to relocate Stargazing Island here and confront the Heavenly Firmament Alliance. This formation is only the foundation.  We will continue to strengthen it later.  It concerns your future safety..."</p><p>"Elder Di, how is the battle going?  Have you rescued Elder Fang?"</p><p>"Are we to remain here indefinitely?"</p><p>...</p><p>For a time, questions arose from the crowd, creating a chaotic scene.</p><p>Elder Di, however, ignored them.  He sat cross-legged in the air, and four more discs, similar in shape but much larger than the previous ones, emerged and floated before him.</p><p>The four large discs hummed, each with a vortex-like pattern that seemed to come alive, beginning to absorb the water vapor from the surroundings.</p><p>Following the order, Teng Zhaogang and the others took their respective discs and, following a specific pattern, chose one of the large discs and flew beneath it to begin the refinement process.</p><p>The large discs were like bottomless pits, endlessly devouring water vapor yet never filling.</p><p>This location was deep within the Azure Mist Great Marsh, rich in water vapor.</p><p>An endless stream of water vapor converged around the large discs, condensing into a tangible form.  Even the lake water below felt the pull from the vortexes, transforming into water dragons that soared upwards.</p><p>The large discs now resembled four giant fountains in the Azure Mist Great Marsh, only hazy water vapor visible, their true forms obscured.</p><p>Teng Zhaogang and the others were bathed in the water vapor, their current situation unknown.</p><p>At this moment, Elder Di finally completed his hand seals, pausing briefly before sweeping his hand over his storage pouch and retrieving a fist-sized mass of spiritual liquid.</p><p>The spiritual liquid flowed in Elder Di's palm like clear water, colorless and odorless.</p><p>But when Qin Sang focused his gaze on the liquid, he sensed a peculiar rhythm within its flow, captivating his attention.</p><p>A sense of alarm arose within Qin Sang.  He forcibly averted his gaze, his body covered in a cold sweat.  He then noticed that most of the others around him were similarly mesmerized by the spiritual liquid.</p><p>Elder Di channeled his spiritual power, pouring it into the liquid.</p><p>The liquid rose from his palm, rapidly expanding until it reached its limit, then suddenly dispersed into a mist.</p><p>A gust of spiritual wind blew, scattering the mist.</p><p>In an instant, the stars above vanished, replaced by dense clouds.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A torrential downpour suddenly ensued!</p><p>Strangely, the raindrops seemed intangible, passing through their bodies. Yet, when they landed in the water, they created large splashes.</p><p>The surrounding water vapor grew denser.</p><p>What a powerful formation! Qin Sang marvelled inwardly.</p><p>The rain poured, the world darkened. Outside the formation, an endless darkness descended, obscuring the outside world.  It was unknown how large an area the Truewater Mirage Formation could affect.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang heard Teng Zhaogang's strained voice, "Junior Brother Qin, Junior Brother Zhan, help me..."</p><p>Qin Sang and Zhan Yi exchanged glances, astonished.  Teng Zhaogang, with his False Core cultivation, was struggling to control a single auxiliary disc.</p><p>They didn't hesitate, quickly flying upwards, joined by several others who followed suit.</p>
