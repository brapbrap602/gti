<h1>Chapter 2154: Conjectures on the Combination Stage</h1><p>“Any discoveries?” Qin Sang asked, unable to contain his curiosity as they flew.</p><p>Su Nu, controlling the Stone Ghost Warrior, shook her head.</p><p>“We probably won’t be able to go much farther,” Qin Sang said, frowning.</p><p>It hadn’t been long, so they didn't need to worry about the erosion of the River of Misfortune, but chaotic energies filled the surroundings.  As they ventured deeper, these forces intensified, requiring them to exert ever-greater power to resist and protect themselves.</p><p>After carefully questioning Patriarch Yuan Xiang, Qin Sang had a rough idea of Yuanjiao Market's location within the River of Misfortune. Based on his understanding of the river, this location shouldn't be so perilous, yet they found themselves barely able to move.</p><p>Qin Sang speculated that perhaps Yuanjiao Market, or the foreign tribe’s sacred ground, was connected to some unknown transformation.</p><p>Su Nu also realized this. The Stone Ghost Warrior was struggling more and more. Her cultivation was inferior to Qin Sang’s, and she would undoubtedly be the first to succumb.</p><p>After traveling a bit further, just as Qin Sang had predicted, the Stone Ghost Warrior's speed slowed dramatically. Turbulent currents of foul energy, capable of shattering mountains, lashed out, making progress nearly impossible.</p><p>Forcing their way forward, the currents left gashes on the warrior’s hardened body, like cuts from a blade.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his senses on their surroundings. Fortunately, besides the violent storms of the River of Misfortune, he detected no other immediate dangers. He summoned the Gray Warbler Sword. Sword light enveloped the Stone Ghost Warrior, and Su Nu immediately felt relief.</p><p>Temporarily free from the oppressive pressure, Su Nu offered her thanks and let out a soft sigh.</p><p>“You still want to persist?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“My master’s kindness remains unrepaid. His whereabouts are unknown, and I know not whether he is safe or in danger. If I don’t give it my all, my heart will find no peace!”</p><p>Su Nu’s voice was filled with worry as she pleaded, “I implore Brother Qin to assist me once more!”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. “I will aid you with my spirit sword. You just focus on moving forward. If it's still impossible, I can ultimately deploy the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles to stabilize the currents for you. However, by then, even if you discover something, we will be spent and unlikely to achieve anything.”</p><p>“Thank you for your understanding, Brother Qin!”</p><p>Su Nu's mind was made up. She immediately urged the Stone Ghost Warrior forward.</p><p>Qin Sang cast a spell to protect himself while simultaneously controlling the Gray Warbler Sword, which hovered above the Stone Ghost Warrior. The sword light shifted and changed, countering the river’s onslaught.</p><p>As time passed, the sword light was forced to contract gradually, until it barely encompassed the Stone Ghost Warrior, like a thin layer of armor.</p><p>Qin Sang changed his incantation, deploying the Four Symbols Sword Formation. The situation stabilized as they were enveloped within the formation, merging with the darkness.</p><p>Unfortunately, the respite was short-lived.  The relentless assault of the River of Misfortune was omnipresent and pervasive. Qin Sang felt the strain increasing.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Crackle!*</p><p>A bolt of lightning dispelled the darkness, cleaving through the turbulent currents like a sharp sword before vanishing into the depths of the River of Misfortune.</p><p>Qin Sang employed thunder magic. A Thunder Seal appeared high in the air, unleashing bolts of lightning that illuminated their path and cleared a way forward.</p><p>At the same time, Su Nu exerted all her strength.  The Stone Ghost Warrior fought with ferocious intensity, throwing heavy punches. The chilling fist winds, upon leaving the warrior’s body, transformed into humanoid specters. They emitted strange, piercing shrieks as they ravenously devoured the turbulent currents, ultimately perishing alongside them.</p><p>With Qin Sang and Su Nu’s skillful coordination, their speed unexpectedly increased, but this momentum only lasted for a brief period.</p><p>A terrifying pressure descended from all directions, relentless and unending.  Before the might of the River of Misfortune, both sword light and thunder paled.</p><p>Qin Sang persevered for a little longer. With a flick of his sleeve, a point of golden light flew out, transforming into the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles, and the power of the Void Domain unfolded. In an instant, the golden light spread. Qin Sang felt the pressure lessen considerably. He poured his remaining energy into his thunder magic and swordsmanship, propelling the Stone Ghost Warrior forward a significant distance.</p><p>Sadly, despite Su Nu's continuous use of secret techniques, attempting to sense something, she found nothing.</p><p>Now, the pressure rested almost entirely on Qin Sang, nearing the limit of what he could endure.</p><p>He made a decisive decision and transmitted his voice, “It’s time to return!”</p><p>Su Nu sighed. The Stone Ghost Warrior’s eyes were filled with reluctance. Fortunately, Su Nu wasn't reckless.  Dejectedly, she said, “Let’s go.”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a slight easing of tension.  He urged the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles to retreat.  Retreating was far easier than advancing. Their speed increased rapidly until they stopped at a location they could withstand.</p><p>The two discussed the situation and made another attempt. With the experience of their first try, they reached an even greater depth, yet still returned empty-handed.</p><p>After three attempts, pushing themselves to their limits, they failed to find Su Nu's master.  They hadn’t even glimpsed a shred of hope.  Their insufficient strength was the primary obstacle, something no other method could compensate for.</p><p>Despite her unwillingness, Su Nu had no choice but to give up.</p><p>Outside the Black Tide.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body opened his eyes and looked at Su Nu. Seeing her furrowed brows, he said, “If your judgment of the trace fluctuations is correct, I fear only a Combination Stage cultivator could reach that place.”</p><p>Su Nu was startled, murmuring, “Is Brother Qin saying that my master…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He had exhausted almost all his means—thunder magic, swordsmanship, and the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles—enough to contend with a late-stage Void Refinement cultivator, yet he could barely make any progress.</p><p>Su Nu’s master must possess at least Combination Stage cultivation to have ventured so deep.</p><p>“Such a trace couldn’t have been left unintentionally. Did your master say anything to you before he left?” Qin Sang inquired.</p><p>Su Nu's expression was somber. “Master said he was going to do something, that it was his mission, and that regardless of the outcome, he would have no regrets. He told me to live well. His tone when he said this, it was like he was…”</p><p>Su Nu trailed off.</p><p>It was clearly a farewell message, indicating that the task he was undertaking might be life-threatening. No wonder Su Nu was so worried.</p><p>“Your master didn't tell you where he was going, nor did he ask you to rescue him.  If you hadn't encountered me, under normal circumstances, you would have almost certainly not come to the foreign tribe to participate in Yuanjiao Market, and you wouldn't have discovered the trace he left…” Qin Sang paused. “Could it be that this wasn’t meant for you?  Does your master have a sect, any friends?”</p><p>“Master never mentioned his sect. During the time I followed him, he never visited any other fellow Daoists.”</p><p>Su Nu's face was etched with worry.</p><p>Knowing her master might be in danger, yet having no idea who to turn to for help, Qin Sang understood Su Nu's feelings. He calmly analyzed, “Since your master left a trace, it proves he believed someone capable of saving him might come here.  You might as well preserve the trace and leave your own mark beside it. Even Void Refinement cultivators have so many life-saving methods.  With the divine abilities of a Combination Stage cultivator, your master certainly won't perish easily.  He is likely trapped somewhere. Once he escapes, or the one he awaits arrives and discovers the mark, they will seek you out.”</p><p>“If that person never appears, does that mean we must wait until we reach the Combination Stage ourselves to rescue Master? I am self-aware. I can only hope Brother Qin achieves a breakthrough soon…”</p><p>Su Nu seemed lost.</p><p>Qin Sang gave a self-deprecating smile. He didn’t dare make any promises.  After reaching the Void Refinement Stage, his cultivation had been relatively smooth, but he couldn’t guarantee he would definitely break through to the Combination Stage.</p><p>Of course, they could also ask other powerful figures for help.</p><p>Near the Sea of Mist, Qin Sang knew a certain Realist Ning, but he didn’t want to become too involved with him, and Su Nu didn’t possess any treasures that could move such a figure. Moreover, Su Nu's master might not want a complete stranger to rescue him.</p><p>As they spoke, the Dharma Body and the Stone Ghost Warrior returned. Su Nu stood before the Black Tide for a long while, gazing deeply at the River of Misfortune before resolutely turning to leave.</p><p>Venturing into the River of Misfortune with Su Nu had delayed them. Returning to Yuanjiao Market, Qin Sang busied himself between the trade fair and the Treasure Tree.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang visited Patriarch Yuan Xiang, inquiring about anything unusual about the section of the River of Misfortune where Yuanjiao Market was located.</p><p>Patriarch Yuan Xiang said, “Many have been curious in the past, taking advantage of Yuanjiao Market’s opening to explore deeper, but they all returned empty-handed, having wasted their energy. Since Yuanjiao Market's existence, there have never been legends of ancient secret realms or legacies of powerful figures nearby.  On the contrary, it’s more dangerous and chaotic than other places, so people gradually lost interest.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Su Nu and saw that her expression remained composed. She had accepted the reality. Su Nu was always intelligent. Initially driven by the urgency to save her master, now that she had calmed down, she would understand what could be done and what couldn't.</p><p>“The Daoists from Purple Cloud Mountain should arrive soon. Realist Qin might as well stay and wait a few days,” Patriarch Yuan Xiang said.</p><p>“Very well!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Before entering the sacred ground, he definitely needed to meet with Liuli to discuss their actions inside.</p><p>Afterward, they would separate. Liuli and Liao Chen would be in the open, while he would remain hidden.</p><p>On the evening of the fourth day, Liuli and Liao Chen finally arrived. Only the two of them came; Realist Ning didn’t accompany them.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin, Master asked me to pass this talisman to you,” Liuli spoke first upon seeing Qin Sang, handing him a talisman before he could even offer a greeting.</p><p>Qin Sang observed carefully, noticing a subtle shift in Liuli’s demeanor. Although a smile was still rare on her face, the coldness had diminished, making her seem less distant.  Before, she had been like an iceberg.</p><p>Previously, she had seemed like someone cultivating detachment, but now she was becoming more like a normal person.</p><p>He couldn’t tell whether this change was good or bad.</p><p>Qin Sang remained impassive.  He exchanged greetings and accepted the talisman.  He sensed a shielding power emanating from it, understanding that its purpose was to conceal fluctuations while absorbing the sacred mountain’s essence within Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>“Please convey my gratitude to Realist Ning on my behalf, Fairy,” Qin Sang said, carefully putting the talisman away.</p><p>“I will inform Master,” Liuli said softly.</p><p>In the past, she wouldn’t have even replied, only offering the slightest of nods.</p><p>“Realist Qin,” Liao Chen interjected, “the first thing we must do is choose a meeting place and agree on a time limit. Even if we can't reach it before the deadline, we must find a way to send a message. Otherwise, we’ll know something has happened.”</p><p>Qin Sang indicated his understanding. This was precisely what he and Si Huang had agreed upon first.</p><p>Entering the sacred ground marked the beginning of the trials. Therefore, the mirage wouldn't take them to a fixed location. Only the mirage’s master and attendants would remain together.  Everyone else would be separated, their landing spot entirely dependent on luck.</p><p>Competition within the sacred ground was brutal.  If one were to land directly in the lair of a Combination Stage ferocious beast, there would be no way to call for help or escape. After a certain period, the sacred ground would open a passage, and only then could they leave.</p><p>Of course, the purpose of the sacred ground trial was to select the strongest, not to kill indiscriminately. Such “meet and kill” scenarios were almost nonexistent.</p><p>The sacred ground was vast and boundless, but through countless explorations by experts of various tribes, they had mapped out the general terrain and created cartographic charts.</p><p>However, these charts could only mark approximate locations.  The sacred ground wasn’t static.  The same mountain might have undergone earth-shattering changes within, transforming from a safe haven to a place teeming with danger.</p><p>The simplest example was that the lairs of ferocious beasts would shift constantly.</p><p>“Where has the Venerable chosen?”</p><p>Qin Sang conjured a cartographic chart with his true essence. The markings were sparse, mostly indicating certain mountains, rivers, or lakes, or secret realms and legacies where great battles had once taken place and were known to all—places that had long been plundered.</p><p>“Mount Windfire!”</p><p>Liao Chen had already made his decision, pointing to a location on the map. “Atop this mountain, wind and fire never cease, making it easily recognizable. This phenomenon has persisted for a long time and shouldn’t change suddenly.”</p><p>Having decided on the location and agreed on a time limit, Qin Sang, considering his agreement with Si Huang, requested a more extended timeframe, to which Liao Chen and Liuli agreed.</p><p>After discussing further details, Qin Sang rose and took his leave.</p><p>On his way back, Qin Sang continued to ponder Liuli's transformation. The Path of Supreme Detachment she cultivated seemed somewhat different from what he had imagined.</p><p>…</p><p>Five months passed in a flash, and the day the sacred ground would open drew near.</p><p>During these days, Qin Sang reaped a bountiful harvest, exchanging most of the Lu family treasury for useful items. Unfortunately, he hadn’t acquired any supreme treasures or encountered any opportunities to unearth hidden gems.</p><p>Ten days before the sacred ground’s opening, Qin Sang met with Si Lu.</p><p>Entrusted by Shao Shi, Si Lu brought a spirit pill.</p><p>Qin Sang swallowed the pill. The pill’s power flowed directly to his brow, transforming into a round bead identical to the one on the Si You tribe’s foreheads.  Qin Sang's aura shifted accordingly, changing him into a Si You cultivator.</p><p>“What a profound pill!” Qin Sang exclaimed. With some further disguise, no one would question his identity.</p><p>At the same time, Si Lu brought news that made Zhu Que bristle with indignation.</p><p>“What! You’re saying this Zhu Que cannot enter the sacred ground?” Zhu Que demanded furiously.</p><p>Si Lu explained, “Fellow Daoist Zhu Que is aware that the Sea of Mist lies within the East Sea, and many tribes, especially those of the Heavenly Department, are on good terms with the aquatic races of the East Sea. To prevent anyone from forming a temporary pact with a Great Yao and disguising themselves as a spirit beast to exploit this loophole, the Ancient Covenant sealed this gap.  Void Refinement level spirit beasts and spirit insects can only enter if they are bound by a life-sharing pact, or in the case of a few tribes whose bloodline abilities are limited to beast taming, the requirements are relaxed, but still very strict. The gate to the sacred ground is incredibly profound, possessing the ability to discern. If Fellow Daoist Zhu Que were to force entry, I fear it would cause unnecessary complications.”</p><p>Not being able to bring Zhu Que meant losing a valuable asset, which was a pity. Fortunately, the Sky-Gazing Butterfly could still accompany him.</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  Seeing Zhu Que still ranting, he said, “Imagine the consequences if a Vermillion Bird suddenly appeared before the gate of the sacred ground.”</p><p>Zhu Que immediately fell silent.</p><p>Su Nu said gently, “Brother Qin, rest assured. I and Fellow Daoist Zhu Que will certainly watch over Qing Yang Zhi, freeing you from any worries!”</p>
