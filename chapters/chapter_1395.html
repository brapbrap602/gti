<h1>Chapter 1387: Heavenly Maiden Scattering Flowers</h1><p>This scene took both factions completely by surprise.</p><p>The man in white, relentlessly pursued by the Rainbow Rat, was gravely wounded and seemingly at death’s door.  Everyone expected him to be a pushover, yet he proved unexpectedly resilient.</p><p>Gazing at the man in the snow,</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished.</p><p>He had assumed a treasure was hidden here, but it was a person!</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang keenly observed the others’ and the demons’ eyes flash with intense avarice.  Something about this man held a secret, he realized.</p><p>The unexpected appearance of the man in white</p><p>brought the battlefield to a standstill for a moment.</p><p>He surveyed his surroundings, a cynical smile playing on his lips.  With an icy tone, he raised his hand and said, “You’ve all been searching for it, haven't you?  Take it!”</p><p>In his palm, he held a square ice box.</p><p>Carved from profound ice, the box was adorned with intricate carvings of dragons and phoenixes, its surface shimmering with potent magical energy.  It was exquisitely crafted and clearly no ordinary item.</p><p>The treasure within this ice box was undoubtedly exceptional!</p><p>Before his words had even finished,</p><p>the man in white forcefully flung the box into the air.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Enveloped in white light, the box shot skyward with astonishing speed, heading straight towards Qin Sang and Bi Fang at a devilishly precise angle.</p><p>An uproar erupted across the battlefield.</p><p>Excluding the man in white, the small island held five Yuan Ying stage cultivators and six Demon Kings.</p><p>These were all cunning and experienced individuals.</p><p>They suspected the man in white was using a fake treasure as a distraction to escape, but they also feared losing the real treasure to him.</p><p>Feng Shangshi's expression shifted rapidly.</p><p>Jiao Hu and the Frog Fish were already approaching the valley.</p><p>Unlike Feng Shangshi's hesitation, they swiftly decided to split up.</p><p>They would seize the box, and the man would not escape!</p><p>Jiao Hu let out a shriek, her fluffy tail lashing out as she leaped.</p><p>The Frog Fish, meanwhile, fixed its gaze intently on the man in white.</p><p>The others were not to be outdone, and all joined the fray.</p><p>For a moment, the air was filled with flying lights.</p><p>Feng Shangshi was the fastest, his body still hurtling towards the valley. With a subtle tremor of his left arm, an almost invisible thread shot out, *whoosh*, towards the ice box.</p><p>The thread, though seemingly frail, was incredibly agile.</p><p>It was about to reach the ice box, faster even than Jiao Hu.</p><p>Jiao Hu's eyes flickered, her mouth opening wide.  Though no sound was heard, invisible waves of sonic energy rippled out, locking onto the thread!</p><p>As if solidifying the space around it, the thread became mired, its speed plummeting.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't gravely wounded Jiao Hu earlier, things would have been far more difficult.</p><p>Impeded by Jiao Hu, the thread failed to ensnare the ice box. Feng Shangshi, enraged, poured more energy into the thread, causing it to whip out violently towards Jiao Hu.</p><p>Jiao Hu dared not take the blow head-on and was forced to evade.</p><p>The ice box, nearly captured by Jiao Hu, was struck by the aftershock. The white light trembled, and its trajectory altered, sending it flying towards Shen Daozhu.</p><p>Annoyance flashed in Jiao Hu's eyes; she was about to pursue the ice box when she was suddenly overcome with a chilling tremor.</p><p>The feeling was intensely familiar.</p><p>Jiao Hu's heart skipped a beat, her body involuntarily halting.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A thunderbolt descended before Jiao Hu.</p><p>The Summoning Thunder Technique again!</p><p>However, this time, Qin Sang’s target was not an opponent, but the ice box!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The ice box was struck directly by the thunderbolt. Those present felt their hearts leap into their throats, cursing Qin Sang's audacity.</p><p>If the treasure was fragile, this one strike would have rendered everyone's efforts futile.</p><p>The white light surrounding the ice box couldn't withstand the Summoning Thunder Technique and was shattered by the lightning, revealing the box itself.  Within the blinding flash of lightning, the ice box crumbled into pieces, scattering ice shards and revealing a jade-white object.</p><p>"Snow-veined Cold Jade..."</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the object instantly, his disappointment palpable.</p><p>Snow-veined Cold Jade was a type of cold jade, named for its snowflake-like patterns. It was indeed a rare treasure, and this piece was of high quality, but not valuable enough to warrant such a desperate scramble.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang shattered the ice box, the island violently shook.</p><p>A bone-chilling wave of cold air surged from the valley.</p><p>From outside the island, one could clearly see a white torrent of ice erupting from the ground, exploding in mid-air in a blast of extreme cold.</p><p>A terrifying shockwave spread outwards simultaneously.</p><p>The frogfish nearest the deep valley felt the danger first, hastily releasing a green light that solidified into a protective shroud.</p><p>A relentless cold current eroded the valley walls, revealing a dazzling white light within and the faint outline of a spirit array.</p><p>It was the turn of spring and summer.</p><p>The deserted island prematurely plunged into winter.</p><p>The ice explosion was massive, engulfing most of the island.</p><p>A blinding white expanse met the eye.</p><p>Along with the cold current came dozens of identical ice chests, scattering like falling blossoms in every direction.</p><p>The figure in white vanished, merging with the ice blast.</p><p>The next moment, a dozen figures in white appeared, using the current to propel themselves in all directions.</p><p>The man in white had clearly prepared a contingency plan.</p><p>The ice chests were a mere distraction; he hadn't expected to deceive many, merely to create chaos and facilitate his escape.</p><p>Ice and snow swirled across the battlefield, throwing everything into disarray.</p><p>The eagle and serpent demons, along with Shen Daozhu and the others, abandoned their duel and charged towards the cold current.</p><p>Letting the man in white escape would render all their efforts useless.</p><p>What good was their desperate fighting if that happened?</p><p>Bifa, initially aiming for the first ice chest, saw that it contained only a snow-patterned cold jade.  Seeing the man in white's attempt to flee, he abandoned the jade.</p><p>While unsure what the man in white had taken from the Xuan Tian Palace, even a depleted Xuan Tian Palace wouldn’t treasure snow-patterned cold jade.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, unceremoniously scooped up the jade.</p><p>“It seems the man in white has something better on him…”</p><p>He pondered this, gazing thoughtfully at the receding current.  Unruffled, he ordered the Sky Eye Butterfly to use its full power to unravel the man in white's trickery.</p><p>The man in white's methods were undeniably sophisticated.</p><p>Ice chests flew everywhere, real and fake, blurring the line between reality and illusion.  His duplicates were remarkably agile, making it difficult to distinguish the genuine from the false.</p><p>One or two individuals might easily be deceived and miss their chance.</p><p>However, the island was teeming with experts. Against so many, his trickery proved insufficient; his illusions were shattered in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang effortlessly pinpointed the man in white's true form.</p><p>Bifa and the others lacked the Sky Eye Butterfly's direct perception, but their combat experience was exceptionally rich, lagging only a step behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to strike first, the Sky Eye Butterfly issued a warning, detecting something unusual at the edge of the battlefield.</p><p>Amid the ice blast, everyone scrambled for what they could.</p><p>The battlefield was in utter chaos.</p><p>A rainbow rat peeked from a crevice, seizing the opportunity to slip out, its body seemingly encased in ice, blending seamlessly with the blast.  It silently escaped the island, evading everyone's notice.</p><p>Yet, even the most skillful concealment couldn't hide from the Sky Eye's divine power.</p>
