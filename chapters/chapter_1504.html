<h1>Chapter 1495: A Hard-Fought Battle (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1495: A Hard-Fought Battle (4k)</p><p>Liuli closed her eyes tightly.</p><p>Tong Lingyu surmised that Liuli could influence Yin Changsheng's control over the Four-Ride Serpent Seal, but it was only a deduction.  She couldn't offer more guidance; Liuli had to figure it out herself.</p><p>In an instant, Liuli activated the Treasure Refining Technique, and indeed felt the connection between herself and the spiritual treasure.</p><p>This feeling was several times clearer than before she had perfected the Ice Soul Divine Light!</p><p>Ice Soul Divine Light was one of the top divine abilities of the ice path.</p><p>The Four-Ride Serpent Seal was also such a spiritual treasure.</p><p>In the depths of her perception, Liuli sensed a flicker of spirited excitement within the treasure.</p><p>At this moment,</p><p>the physical form of the Four-Ride Serpent Seal vanished from everyone's sight.</p><p>In its place was a faint, ethereal blue light that enveloped the area above.</p><p>At this moment, the thirteen ice mirrors of the Falling Shadow Divine Restriction were completely obscured by the light of the Four-Ride Serpent Seal.</p><p>The blue light shifted restlessly, appearing somewhat erratic, rising and falling, very illusory, like flames dancing above a fire, their movement full of a dreamy quality.</p><p>To the naked eye, it resembled a tragically beautiful icy flame, extremely pure, captivating the heart.</p><p>But beauty hid danger.</p><p>The roars of the serpent emanated from within the icy flames, rising and falling, the shrill, piercing sounds seeming to come from the mouth of a true ancient divine beast, piercing through countless years, striking at the opponents' minds.</p><p>Hearing this sound would evoke instinctive fear.</p><p>Within the layers of icy flames, a gigantic figure appeared intermittently—sometimes a long tail covered in scales, sometimes a massive head with bell-like eyes emitting a fierce aura.</p><p>The serpent writhed within the icy flames, never revealing itself for long, each appearance fleeting, immediately vanishing into the depths of the flames.</p><p>A glimpse, yet enough to intensify the opponent's fear.</p><p>Some legends revere the serpent as a fire god.</p><p>Although this was not spirit fire, not true icy flames, but a phenomenon formed by intensely concentrated cold, and the serpent was also a manifestation of the spiritual treasure,</p><p>the scene bore little difference from legend.</p><p>The power of the spiritual treasure was fully displayed!</p><p>Under the influence of the icy flames, the entire cavern grew intensely frigid. The cold air solidified, turning the cavern into a hazy white expanse.</p><p>Oddly enough, the Abyssal Yin Blood Pool showed no signs of freezing.  The blood within the pool became even more vibrant, and the blood tendrils spread at an increasing rate.</p><p>'Hiss… hiss…'</p><p>Each roar was more urgent than the last.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was extremely serious.</p><p>A sword beam leaped from his fingertip.</p><p>The Golden Immersion Sword flew out of the Qianjun Ring, its body flashing as it hovered above Qin Sang's head, pointed towards Yin Changsheng.  It seemed to also feel the pressure from the spiritual treasure, its body trembling slightly, emitting a series of sword chimes.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Liuli beside him, seeing that she had her eyes closed, concentrating on activating the Treasure Refining Technique to control the spiritual treasure; she had even retracted her Ice Soul Divine Light, and would likely be unable to spare her attention for a short time.</p><p>His knowledge of the spiritual treasure was too limited, and he felt uneasy, unsure how long Liuli needed to prepare or how much influence she could exert on Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Just then,</p><p>an extremely sharp shriek echoed through the air – more than one!</p><p>At the same time, the icy flames frantically condensed inward, revealing two thick serpentine shadows.</p><p>The two serpents intertwined, icy flames flickering in their fierce eyes, killing intent evident as they stared at Qin Sang.  Bathed in the icy flames, they used the flames as wings, their slender bodies suddenly swaying.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A piercing cold wind blew against their faces.</p><p>The cold wind struck the cavern walls, producing a series of ‘bang bang’ sounds, instantly coating the walls with a layer of sparkling frost.</p><p>In an instant, the two serpentine figures vanished into thin air.</p><p>Through the Sky-Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang saw the illusory serpents riding the flames, rushing towards him at an alarming speed.</p><p>Each serpent was smaller than when Tong Lingyu controlled them, but Qin Sang felt an intense sense of crisis.</p><p>"Two!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, his gaze solemn.</p><p>He had a premonition that if he used the Seven Souls Killing Formation to resist, even if he could save his own life, Liuli would surely die.</p><p>He made an immediate decision!</p><p>A flash of lightning appeared behind Qin Sang, his phoenix wings spread wide. He quickly wrapped his arm around Liuli's willow waist—he had no time to appreciate its softness—his figure instantly turning into a streak of lightning, suddenly dashing out.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang used the Thunder Escape Technique,</p><p>the void twisted, and the heads of the two serpents suddenly lunged out, full of fangs.</p><p>At the critical moment,</p><p>Liuli's eyelids trembled slightly.</p><p>One of the serpents suddenly showed a flicker of confusion in its eyes, its head stiffening slightly, slowing its movements by half a beat.</p><p>However, another serpent remained unaffected, its eyes blazing with fury, its maw gaping open as it lunged savagely at Qin Sang's escaping figure, which had transformed into a streak of lightning.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The lightning flashed and flickered, breaking through the air.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang reappeared on the other side of the cavern, his feet landing on the ground with a stumble, narrowly avoiding a collision with the rock wall.</p><p>His face was pale, his eyes filled with a touch of horror as he glanced at his protective barrier.  A mere graze from the serpent had caused cracks to appear in the barrier created by the Ruyi Treasure Pearl.</p><p>"Heh heh, impressive escape technique..."</p><p>A mocking laugh echoed from within the ice coffin, the voice of Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Despite the failed attack, Yin Changsheng showed no anger, his tone instead carrying a playful delight in toying with his opponent.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang was certain that Yin Changsheng's mind had been corrupted by some evil sorcery.</p><p>A leader of his caliber would never behave in such a manner at this crucial moment, especially not so openly.</p><p>However, this did nothing to improve their predicament.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang felt a wave of intense cold, realizing that two serpents had materialized on either side, blocking their escape route.</p><p>A gale of icy wind swept through the cavern.</p><p>The two serpents glared menacingly, their icy flames surging, an overwhelming chill converging towards Qin Sang.</p><p>An invisible pressure enveloped him.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of foreboding, his expression changing drastically, just as he was about to move.</p><p>At that moment, one of the serpents suddenly raised its head, emitting a piercing shriek, its body convulsing as it fell into a daze.</p><p>“It worked!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart leaped with joy.  He looked down at Liuli, whose face was flushed and breathing rapidly. Without hesitation, he immediately carried her away.</p><p>“Yin Changsheng, you plotted and schemed, but you didn't expect Liuli to be able to claim the four-tiered serpent seal, did you?” Tong Lingyu's laughter, though weak, was triumphant.</p><p>“You’re courting death!”</p><p>Yin Changsheng tried to counteract Liuli's interference, but found he couldn't immediately dispel it. He immediately urged the other serpent to pursue them.</p><p>Affected by Liuli, the power of the four-tiered serpent seal was significantly diminished, but it remained formidable.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang noticed another problem; as time passed, under the influence of the spiritual treasure, the cavern's temperature continued to plummet, the air seeming to freeze.</p><p>Had it not been for Liuli's assistance, he would have been frozen solid within moments!</p><p>‘Hiss hiss…’</p><p>The hissing of the serpent came from behind.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have time to think, silently invoking a sword formula.</p><p>The Jinchen Sword trembled, its blade reversing, a streak of sword light slashing out.  Simultaneously, the Jinchen Sword divided into countless others, brilliant as stars, before vanishing as quickly as they appeared, the Seven Souls Killing Formation reappearing.</p><p>At this moment, the illusion in this location became distinctly different from elsewhere.</p><p>The blinding cold air was dispersed by the sword formation, replaced by a gloomy darkness. Invisible sword threads danced, rapidly rushing towards the serpent.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The sword light was shattered instantly.</p><p>The serpent roared and charged, colliding directly with the sword formation.</p><p>In an instant, a terrifying clash erupted between the sword formation and the power of the spiritual treasure.</p><p>The sword threads were endless, densely packed, forming numerous razor-sharp and swift nets, ensnaring the serpent.</p><p>The serpent remained ferocious, refusing to retreat, its body merging with the icy flames, surging forward in waves, layer upon layer, extinguishing the sword nets within the icy flames.</p><p>The shockwaves rippled outwards, impacting the ancient prohibition.</p><p>The cavern shook repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang halted his lightning escape technique, his gaze fixed on the center of the collision. He calmed his racing breath, not daring to hesitate, and poured all his energy into driving the sword formation.</p><p>Faced with such a terrifying impact, the sword formation swayed precariously, but didn't collapse entirely.</p><p>Though the Seven Souls Killing Formation was no match for the four-tiered serpent seal, it was capable of putting up a fight!</p><p>Blocked by the killing formation, the serpent roared in fury.</p><p>It suddenly stopped attacking, raising its head high, its giant eyes radiating a ferocious light, its gaze locked onto Qin Sang.  Its mouth opened wide, all the icy flames converging into its maw.</p><p>At this sight, Qin Sang's heart pounded with alarm.</p><p>With incredible speed, the serpent rapidly condensed the icy flames into a massive fireball within its mouth. Its body dissipated in the wind, merging with the icy flames, and with a roar, it shot forth!</p><p>‘Sizzle!’</p><p>The icy flames shot straight into the Seven Souls Killing Formation.</p><p>The sword threads melted upon contact with the flames.</p><p>An astonishing sight unfolded; the icy flames actually carved a path through the sword formation, hurtling towards Qin Sang.</p><p>The sword array, though weakened, still offered some resistance, diminishing the icy flames' power and slowing their advance.  Qin Sang, without hesitation, pulled Liuli to safety.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>A chilling fog erupted.  The cavern shook violently, as if a colossal earth dragon had stirred.  The icy flames blasted a deep crater into the ground, leaving behind a thick layer of ice.  The scattered flames rapidly coalesced within the crater, forming the outline of a serpent.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared a short distance away, Jin Chen Jian close at his side, undamaged. He took a deep breath and reactivated the sword array, creating a defensive barrier.</p><p>*If Liuli can keep the artifact occupied,* he thought, *I might be able to hold out.*</p><p>Liuli's breathing grew more rapid, but her spiritual energy depletion wasn't as dramatic, making it hard to assess her condition. Her struggle with Yin Changsheng for the artifact seemed to be a battle on a different plane.  *But how long can she hold against an opponent two realms above her?*</p><p>The thought had barely crossed his mind when the icy serpent attacked again. Qin Sang skillfully maneuvered the sword array, weaving through the cavern to evade the serpent.</p><p>Impatient with his inability to quickly subdue Qin Sang, Yin Changsheng let out an enraged snort.  To Qin Sang, the sound was like a thunderclap, his expression instantly changing.  He felt an inexplicable danger and, without delay, unleashed a powerful psychic barrier in front of Liuli.</p><p>Instantly, the space before Liuli twisted, and a transparent, needle-sharp cone materialized.  Its emanations were unlike any spell or technique Qin Sang had encountered before; pure psychic energy, swift, intangible, and almost impossible to defend against.</p><p>Had Qin Sang not reacted so quickly, Liuli's spirit would have been severely damaged.</p><p>"A psychic attack technique!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed. His psychic abilities surpassed those of cultivators at his level, but he lacked such specialized techniques, hindering his full potential. Creating one from scratch would be extremely time-consuming and demanding.</p><p>Late-stage Yuan Ying cultivators truly had few weaknesses.  Yin Changsheng was clearly adept at psychic attacks.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had anticipated this, keeping a close watch on Liuli while controlling the sword array. He knew Liuli was the weak point, and Yin Changsheng wouldn't miss the opportunity.</p><p>The psychic cone was blocked by Qin Sang's barrier.  He grabbed Liuli and retreated.</p><p>Strangely, he felt no pain. Though his psychic strength was considerable, this simple defensive measure was no match for Yin Changsheng's refined technique.</p><p>Then, a sudden change.  A transparent needle appeared at Qin Sang's brow, vanishing as quickly as it came. Yin Changsheng's true target was Qin Sang!  However, had Qin Sang not shielded Liuli, the cone would have materialized, severely injuring her.  Regardless of his actions, one of them would be hurt.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang staggered, a muffled groan escaping his lips. Blood trickled from his orifices; his eyes were bloodshot, and his breathing was ragged.</p><p>This, of course, was a deliberate act. Yin Changsheng's psychic attack couldn't harm his spirit. Qin Sang was a master of deception.</p><p>The jade Buddha must remain hidden; it might be the key to victory.  He'd been holding back, barely avoiding summoning his external avatar and the solar tree.  Yin Changsheng's pressure was overwhelming, and he'd found no opening to counterattack.</p><p>Throughout the fight, Qin Sang was multitasking, using the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to observe the ancient restriction.  He desperately wanted to leave the cavern, but analysis revealed the top was sealed not only by the ancient restriction, but also by thirteen ice mirrors formed from the Luo You Divine Restriction.  A double barrier. Yin Changsheng would relentlessly stop their escape; Qin Sang could at most break one layer, leaving him vulnerable thereafter.</p><p>His options were limited: follow Tong Lingyu's advice and stall, but Yin Changsheng was unfathomable, and unexpected events could occur. Or, attack the Yin Blood Pool or Yin Changsheng himself. Yin Changsheng was unstable; destroying the pool and his hopes of becoming a Transcendent cultivator would enrage him, but might expose a weakness.</p><p>However, such an opportunity wasn't easy to create. Yin Changsheng never left the pool's side.</p><p>Tong Lingyu and Luo Yun were gone, dragged down into the pool by the ice platform – their fate uncertain.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that despite the intense battle, the blood in the pool remained undisturbed, protected by some unseen force.  He found no obvious defensive array.</p><p>He suspected the pool's energy was directly linked to Yin Changsheng himself.  If he was the "eye" of the array, things would be much more complicated.</p><p>*Clang clang clang…*</p><p>Qin Sang retreated, his sword array faltering. His eyes widened, seemingly struggling to maintain the array despite the psychic damage.</p><p>Yin Changsheng, believing he had the upper hand, laughed triumphantly. He had struck when Qin Sang was distracted, protecting Liuli; convinced he had won.</p>
