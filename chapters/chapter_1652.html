<h1>Chapter 1643: Fire Rhinoceros Island</h1><p>Chapter 1643: Fire Rhinoceros Island</p><p>The Yunyou Sword hung suspended above.</p><p>Its tip pointed directly at the Gu King.</p><p>The sword's energy surged, its intent brewing, yet concealed.</p><p>Before the sword even moved, the Gu King showed signs of anxiety, its protective poisonous aura shrinking inward—a clear sign of encountering a natural enemy.</p><p>The Gu King raised its head, glared at the Yunyou Sword, and let out a threatening cry.  To Qin Sang's ears, however, the sound lacked conviction.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately understood the key and intensified the sword's intent. The Yunyou Sword trembled slightly, and a torrent of sword light erupted.</p><p>The sword light held no killing intent, only pure sword energy.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't intend to kill the Gu King, but to subdue its ferocity.</p><p>The effect of this sword was immediate.</p><p>The Gu King scurried to avoid it. Having been with the grotesque-faced man for many years, its fear of this energy was ingrained in its very being.</p><p>Qin Sang adjusted his technique several times, using poison beads in conjunction.</p><p>Finally, the Gu King enveloped itself with its wings, curling into a ball. Its protective poisonous aura formed a sphere, creating a cocoon of light, sealing itself away.</p><p>"Whew…"</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, studying the light cocoon.</p><p>With the Yunyou Sword above, channeling its intent, and the poison beads transforming into a luminous mist to surround the cocoon, the dual pressure barely managed to suppress the Gu King's ferocity.</p><p>The Gu King had entered a state of self-imposed dormancy.</p><p>This state, however, could hardly be considered subjugation.</p><p>Because Qin Sang hadn't displayed any killing intent, a strange balance was maintained between them.  Once the Gu King sensed a threat to its life, the balance would shatter.</p><p>The Gu King possessed low intelligence and a ferocious nature.  Except for the grotesque-faced man who raised it, no one else could make it submit—at least, Qin Sang couldn't think of a way.</p><p>But getting the poison bead to devour the Gu King wouldn't be easy either.</p><p>After some thought, he attempted to control the poison bead, revealing its devouring aura. The light cocoon trembled, and the Gu King's ferocity was almost reactivated.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly withdrew his attempt, thinking that maintaining this state was good enough for now. He would think of a solution after leaving the Wuxiang Sect.</p><p>He flicked his fingers, sending several sword seals into the Yunyou Sword. The spiritual sword maintained its intent independently, freeing him from the mental strain. Then, with a thought, he withdrew all three into his body.</p><p>The poison bead's luminous mist, enveloping the cocoon, returned to his dantian.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword resided high in his purple府, its intent reaching his energy sea.</p><p>Qin Sang calmed his mind, sensed for a moment, confirmed everything was fine, and stopped paying attention to the Gu King. He then organized the grotesque-faced man's belongings, categorizing and storing them neatly.</p><p>His avatar, which had been meditating, had mostly recovered.</p><p>In this battle, the avatar had repeatedly controlled spiritual treasures in coordination with its original body, resulting in significant energy depletion. However, the results were brilliant, especially the gains from the Bingyi Palace, which made Qin Sang exclaim that the trip was worthwhile.</p><p>The avatar handed the Ice-Fire Order and the water-attribute inheritance to the original body, and also depicted the memory arrays and restrictions, which were then stored by the original body for future study.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang planned to split their forces again.  The original body would proceed to Emperor Bestowal Mountain to scout the situation and prepare for the competition for the transformation-to-god opportunity.  The avatar would go to Fire Rhinoceros Island to search for the fire-attribute treasure, then rendezvous at Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>This was a necessary measure, as neither the transformation-to-god opportunity nor the tribulation-crossing array could be missed.  The transformation-to-god opportunity was even more important—without achieving transformation, how could one even discuss crossing the tribulation?</p><p>The Bingyi Divine Disk remained with the avatar; it might be useful on Fire Rhinoceros Island.</p><p>Qin Sang also gave the avatar a Boiling Snow Pill, and opened his spirit beast pouch, allowing the avatar to take the Fire Jade Centipede. The Fire Jade Centipede had advanced to the early stage of the fourth transformation, its sensory abilities greatly enhanced; it would be helpful in treasure hunting.</p><p>The avatar accepted everything.</p><p>The original body opened the cave dwelling's door, soared to the top of the mountain, surveyed the surroundings, confirmed there were no abnormalities, sent a signal, and headed straight for Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Not long after the original body left, the avatar also departed from the cave dwelling, heading south.</p><p>According to… the Fire Phase Hall was built on Fire Rhinoceros Island, located south of Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The avatar flew through the mountains and forests, occasionally stopping to observe.</p><p>After leaving the Bingyi Palace ruins, it turned southeast.</p><p>The Wuxiang Sect was still sparsely populated.  Even after traveling for a considerable time, the avatar didn't sense anyone else’s presence.</p><p>The area was filled with restrictions, ancient trees towering into the sky. The avatar had lost count of how many pavilions and towers it had seen along the way. Numerous ancient halls were hidden amongst the forests, exuding an air of mystery.</p><p>These places might hold treasures as well, but compared to the true inheritances of the five veins, they were far inferior.  Those who entered the Wuxiang Sect now would not linger in such places.</p><p>Recalling the geographical map, the avatar continuously adjusted its direction.</p><p>Finally, after crossing a mountain range, the figure saw a fiery red sky on the horizon.  A floating island was faintly visible – Fire Rhino Island!</p><p>Fire Rhino Island is built upon a vein of magma.  It doesn't hang very high, even lower than the mountain the figure was standing on.  Hidden by mountains and protective barriers, it's invisible from a distance.</p><p>The magma vein is clearly still active.</p><p>The red light dyeing the sky originates from the glowing red magma.</p><p>From afar, the terrain around Fire Rhino Island is unclear, only that it seems much flatter than its surroundings, lacking any significant undulation.  It’s likely a magma lake.</p><p>The figure couldn't estimate the magma vein's extent, so shifted their gaze to Fire Rhino Island above, examining it with a look of surprise.</p><p>Fire Rhino Island isn't entirely floating; four massive pillars of fire connect its base to the magma vein, supporting the island.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the figure discovered these pillars were actually formed of magma.</p><p>Boiling magma flows upward from the vein, feeding into the floating island in an awe-inspiring spectacle. The four pillars resemble fire dragons, bearing the weight of Fire Rhino Island.</p><p>Clearly, this is a feat of array manipulation.</p><p>Fire Rhino Island's protective array is no less impressive than Ice Instrument Palace's, but it seems to be in a precarious state!</p><p>Despite the support of the fire dragons, the island gives an impression of imminent collapse.</p><p>From the figure's vantage point, only one side of the island was visible, but it was clear that many red lines crisscrossed its surface – cracks formed by the influx of magma.</p><p>The island is severely damaged.  If the cracks spread further, it will shatter into pieces.</p><p>The southern side is the most damaged, a large chunk missing, like a circular pie with two pieces cut out.</p><p>Magma flows down from the breach, creating waterfalls.</p><p>These magma waterfalls resemble curtains of fire, converging at the island's center before cascading back down into the magma vein.</p><p>This shows that the four fire dragons aren't the full extent of the support system.</p><p>Analyzing the arrangement of the fire dragons, the figure deduced that if the island were intact, there would be at least nine, eight positioned around a central one, forming a “nine dragons supporting the heavens” configuration.</p><p>In other words, the floating island is mostly destroyed, and crucially, its core support is missing!</p><p>At this sight, the figure's expression darkened, sensing trouble.</p><p>At least the main structure of Ice Instrument Palace remains, and its damaged array still functions minimally.  Fire Rhino Island is in worse shape; most of its treasures must be destroyed.</p><p>However, having come this far…</p><p>Regardless, a closer look is necessary.</p><p>With this in mind, the figure descended the mountain and flew towards Fire Rhino Island.</p><p>The journey was smooth.</p><p>After traversing mountains and valleys, the figure arrived near the magma vein and saw a vast magma lake, its surface roiling with intense, fiery heat.</p><p>The closer the figure got, the more intense the heat became.</p><p>Looking up at Fire Rhino Island, the figure was struck by its ruinous condition; its continued existence seemed miraculous.</p><p>The intense heat and waves of heat washed over them.  The figure, practicing ice-type cultivation techniques, felt some discomfort, but it wasn't significant.</p><p>Their gaze fell on the convergence point of the two magma waterfalls.</p><p>The island's layout was easy to guess. The central area, above the core pillar, must be the most important. However, it was a sea of boiling red magma, making it impossible to determine whether it still existed.</p><p>The four remaining fire dragons – one in the southeast and three in the northern part of the island forming an arc – support the most intact section of the island.</p><p>Despite the proximity, the figure didn't feel the same powerful pressure as the azure light of Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>This indicated that Fire Rhino Island's array was more damaged than anticipated.</p><p>The figure worried about the island collapsing upon their landing, plunging them into the magma.</p><p>Carefully observing the four fire dragons, the figure noticed that their energy connections were weak, each acting independently. This revealed the island's array's structure.</p><p>Each fire dragon is formed by an independent array; the nine dragons represent nine major arrays.  Their function is not only to support the island, but likely also to serve as the island’s array's pillars.</p><p>This explains why, with the island's main array destroyed, and other fire dragons gone, these four remain.</p><p>This news was bittersweet.</p><p>The good news was that the obstacles to treasure hunting would be minimal.</p><p>The bad news was that the central area of Fire Rhino Island was probably devastated, with few treasures left.</p><p>The figure's gaze shifted to the northwest of Fire Rhino Island, where a fiery rope connected the edge of the magma vein to the island itself.</p><p>The crimson chains weren't solid; they were composed of interconnected fire rings, constantly shifting into various shapes of fiery spirit beasts—a truly wondrous sight.  Similar chains existed in other directions, some broken, others teetering—likely pathways to the island.</p><p>During the time Hua Shen observed, Fire Rhinoceros Island and its surroundings remained calm; no one else seemed to be approaching, which was a relief.</p><p>Hua Shen relaxed slightly, his form flickering as he circled the lava lake before reaching a northwestern chain. He cautiously stepped onto it.  Simultaneously, he released the true energy sealing his sleeve, unleashing a streak of crimson-gold light—the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>After its transformation, the Fire Jade Centipede looked far more imposing.</p><p>He concealed the centipede in his palm, his other hand clutching the mysterious ice disc.  </p><p>Unexpectedly, the chain showed no reaction.</p><p>The newly freed Fire Jade Centipede, snapping out of its daze, tensed, its gaze fixed on Fire Rhinoceros Island. It buzzed excitedly, its hundreds of legs scrambling, eager to rush towards the island.  Hua Shen would have had to intervene to prevent it from darting off like a golden thread.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Hua Shen hastily restrained the centipede with true energy, his gaze falling on Fire Rhinoceros Island in surprise.  The centipede's reaction was unprecedentedly fierce; something valuable must be on the island.  Its urgency was intense—what treasure could it be?</p><p>He was equally intrigued but knew this wasn't the Ice Instrument Palace. The ice disc couldn't shield him from the restrictive forces here; caution was paramount.</p><p>The forcefully restrained centipede was furious, its legs frantically scratching against Hua Shen's palm, its body writhing, its carapace clicking. It looked ready to bite its master.</p><p>Hua Shen chuckled, shaking his head before stepping onto the chain.</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>The chain swayed, producing the sound of metal clashing despite its ethereal nature. A faint bell-like chime could be heard from the chain's end.</p><p>Hua Shen paused, but seeing nothing amiss, continued swiftly upward.  Looking down, he saw lava flowing like a tide below.</p><p>After a brisk walk, he reached the chain's end—a platform crafted from expensive fire jade.  He stepped onto the platform, still unaffected by any restrictive attacks; it was more accommodating than the Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>The island's state could only be described as utter devastation.</p><p>Everywhere Hua Shen looked, he saw massive fire-蒲 trees—famous for their enormous leaves, thriving in intense heat.  They were prized by fire cultivators for creating artifacts and talismans. Their greatest use was in spirit arrays; their thick veins extended to their roots, interconnected like the meridians of heaven and earth, capable of regulating fiery energy. The denser the fiery energy, the better the trees thrived.  The lava flowing across Fire Rhinoceros Island only fueled their growth.</p><p>The fire-蒲 forest was chaotically distributed, with fire jade paths crisscrossed by roots and stems, lava paving the ground, leaving little room to walk. This was the result of severe past destruction followed by rampant regrowth. Untended, the trees were exceptionally dense, their leaves twice the normal size, obscuring the buildings beneath.</p><p>With the Fire Jade Centipede guiding him, Hua Shen didn't need to find his way, slightly relaxing his true energy as he saw the centipede heading straight ahead. As expected, whatever attracted it was in the central palace.</p><p>Hua Shen summoned his Snow-Stepping Divine Blade, holding it aloft as he descended from the platform.</p><p>A few steps later, a jet of lava suddenly erupted from a crack in the ground, instantly transforming into a crescent-shaped blade that slashed towards him. A direct hit would have bisected him.</p><p>Hua Shen was prepared, leaning back slightly, swinging his blade to unleash a chilling blade energy that collided squarely with the fiery blade.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Both blade energy and fiery blade vanished.</p><p>Immediately, the fiery energy in the surroundings surged, causing the fire-蒲 trees to shake violently, threatening to snap, and the ground trembled in response.</p><p>Hua Shen's face darkened. This was only possible due to his incredible control.  Open confrontation with the restrictions wouldn't be difficult, but repeated clashes might disrupt the floating island's energy, triggering unpredictable consequences.  Step-by-step analysis, however, would take too long.</p><p>After a moment's thought, remembering the Fire Jade Centipede's previous behavior, an idea struck him. He released some of his true energy, allowing the centipede to lead the way.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, finally free, shot forward.  A golden light zig-zagged through the fire-蒲 trees, instantly traveling hundreds of feet without triggering any restrictive attacks.</p><p>Hua Shen smiled.  The array here was fractured and distorted; gaps between the restrictions served as natural pathways, perfect for the Fire Jade Centipede.  Using the Heavenly Eye Butterfly would have been even more effective, of course.</p><p>Hua Shen swiftly followed the centipede, weaving through the forest.  Though he inevitably triggered and was attacked by restrictions, it remained manageable.</p><p>Soon, Hua Shen saw a cluster of palaces amidst the trees, their foundations submerged in lava, surrounded by collapsed structures—a scene of utter devastation. The Fire Jade Centipede showed no hesitation, its body swaying as it darted over the ruins of a palace.</p>
