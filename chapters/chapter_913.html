<h1>Chapter 905: Cutting Off the Retreat</h1><p>Ignoring the angry shouts behind him, Qin Sang dashed into the passage and sprinted towards the exit.  Simultaneously, he activated the Devil Banner, unleashing the Nine Netherworld Devilfire. The Hun Yuan concentric ring whirred out, enveloping the two-headed beast.</p><p>He knew Black Serpent Mountain had left personnel outside the island.  Uncertain of their numbers, Qin Sang didn't dare relax.  Failure to quickly eliminate his opponents meant certain encirclement. The situation was chaotic, but having publicly slain the black-robed man and seized the treasure, he was now a target.  Unless foolish, Black Serpent Mountain and the Lan Dou Island cultivators would temporarily cease fighting each other, uniting to kill him before squabbling over the treasure. After all, the treasure belonged to Lan Dou Sect; those cultivators had no personal feud with Black Serpent Mountain.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang ordered the two-headed beast to use its newly mastered Qingying divine ability. The two-headed beast roared reluctantly; it hadn't fully mastered the ability and each use weakened it.  But under Qin Sang's stern gaze, it obeyed.</p><p>The passage wasn't long.  Although the black smoke from the flag array had corroded the fog and runes, the pressure from the surrounding spirit arrays remained intense. Fortunately, Qin Sang and the two-headed beast successfully broke through the confinement.</p><p>The black smoke didn't lessen, but the pressure vanished abruptly.  Then, a surprised voice came from outside: "Is that Second Senior Brother? Did you get it?"</p><p>The voice was unfamiliar.  Qin Sang realized this was Black Serpent Mountain's lookout.  Waiting outside was a dwarf, the tenth disciple of Black Serpent Mountain, left to guard and maintain the flag array and passage. Believing it was his fellow disciples escaping after success, he was overjoyed.</p><p>The next moment, the black smoke churned, and two figures, one tall and one short, burst forth. The dwarf's joyful expression froze. "Who are you?!"</p><p>Qin Sang saw only two people outside, one of whom was Zhao Songqiao.  Relieved, he immediately ordered the two-headed beast to attack.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>The two-headed beast lunged forward, its body shuddering as a Qingying shadow detached itself.</p><p>The dwarf was furious and shocked. He assumed that with Second Senior Brother's strength, and possessing the Beast King Banner, even if they failed to steal the treasure, they wouldn't be completely wiped out, losing the passage. He had maintained the flag array, completely unprepared for this situation.  Now realizing the danger, he reacted instinctively.</p><p>A vortex appeared on the dwarf's chest, a beetle-like insect shadow about to emerge.  He retreated hastily.  However, the dwarf was weaker than the two-headed beast and stood no chance.</p><p>Before the insect emerged, the Qingying shadow, in the dwarf's horrified gaze, struck. A gust of wind hit him; the Qingying shadow was incredibly fast. The dwarf, paralyzed by a strange force, struggled in vain.  With a 'boom,' the Qingying shadow slammed into him, shattering his protective aura.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Qingying shadow pierced through the dwarf, appearing behind him.  It casually killed Zhao Songqiao with a slap before dissipating.  A large hole gaped in the dwarf's chest; his eyes glazed over as he fell backward.</p><p>The two-headed beast panted heavily, listless.</p><p>"Good," Qin Sang praised. Using the divine ability to kill the dwarf was overkill, but in this situation, speed was key.</p><p>The two-headed beast glanced at him before retreating to the Hun Yuan concentric ring to rest.  Qin Sang retrieved the dwarf's pouch, then surveyed the black flags.  With the dwarf dead, the flags destabilized, but the array hadn't collapsed.  He sensed intense fluctuations from the passage behind him; someone was trying to break through.</p><p>Qin Sang turned, his gaze cold. These Black Serpent Mountain cultivators had used him as bait; he wouldn't show any mercy.  He would cut off their retreat!</p><p>Qin Sang shot his true energy at the black flags, trying to retrieve them.  Unexpectedly, the flags trembled, dispersing his true energy.</p><p>Uncontrolled, yet still forming an array? Qin Sang was surprised, then realized the inner and outer arrays were likely linked, functioning even without a master.  Only by understanding how to manipulate the black flags could he remove them, or wait for the Lan Dou Island array to overwhelm and collapse them.</p><p>The situation was critical. Qin Sang had no time to study the formation, so she destroyed it.</p><p>With a flick of her wrist, Qin Sang unleashed the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, which surged towards a black flag.</p><p>The flag formation was already suppressed by the Dongming Island formation, and the black flag itself was being scorched by the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire. It only lasted a moment before the flag was ignited and reduced to ashes.</p><p>The rest was easier.  Black flag after black flag was destroyed, the black smoke thinning, the surrounding white mist pressing inward, narrowing the passage.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang heard an angry shriek, followed by a terrifying wave of power.  Startled, she turned to see a surge of blood energy hurtling towards them.</p><p>Within the blood energy, two blood pythons circled a person.</p><p>She couldn't see the person's face, but Qin Sang sensed two incredibly chilling gazes, like predatory eyes, sending shivers down her spine.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>Qin Sang realized the person within the blood energy was the Fang family youth.</p><p>Most terrifying were the two blood pythons.  Their nature was unknown, but their aura was incredibly powerful. Recalling previous events and the youth's background, Qin Sang suspected their origin: the infamous Blood Corpse Insects.</p><p>Three-transformation Blood Corpse Insects—and there were two!</p><p>Black Serpent Mountain's reserves ran deep.</p><p>The Fang family youth had held Lan Doumen's five Gold Core cultivators captive for so long—this must be the work of these Blood Corpse Insects.</p><p>Behind the blood energy, another figure was in hot pursuit.  From the aura, it was Master Lu.  As a peak Gold Core cultivator, Master Lu had not only survived the blood sea but also retained the power to fight back.</p><p>However, Master Lu was slower than the Fang family youth riding the twin pythons, trailing behind.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang felt a surge of dread.  Even Master Lu had been trapped for so long before escaping; if she were entangled by the Fang family youth, her chances were slim.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.  She dared not delay, unleashing the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire with all her might at the remaining black flags. She also used her ebony sword to strike once more at the passage exit.</p><p>Then, activating her Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman and other escape treasures, she didn't look back, disappearing into the sky in a few blinks.</p><p>The Fang family youth, riding the twin pythons, was no less swift. He was still unaware of the situation, but seeing Qin Sang destroy the flags, he sensed something was amiss.</p><p>Reaching the passage exit, the Fang family youth was about to pursue Qin Sang when he heard screams from within the passage—the cries of his junior brother.</p>
