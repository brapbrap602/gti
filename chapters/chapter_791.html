<h1>Chapter 783: The Seventh Level</h1><p>Chapter 783: The Seventh Level</p><p>‘Click!’</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Three sounds in succession, and the triple barriers shattered.  Even the copper mirror, renowned for its defensive capabilities, was not spared.  A crack appeared in its center after the impact, splitting it in two.  Whether it could be repaired was uncertain.</p><p>Qin Sang’s vision blurred, his body racked with pain. He felt as if he’d been hit by a mountain, his true energy wildly depleting, his protective aura almost extinguished. The fragments of golden light were sharp as blades, the demonic energy possessing a terrifying corrosive power.</p><p>Qin Sang was sent flying backward, losing sight of the two-headed beast beside him.</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt a sense of relief. The three of them, working together, had withstood the strongest wave of the attack. Though injured, they were at least alive.</p><p>After a difficult struggle, the aftershocks gradually dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang, pale-faced, steadied himself in mid-air and saw the two-headed beast not far away.  The beast’s appearance was comical; its fur was patchy, missing in several places, its tail completely bald, yet it seemed lively and well.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang’s gaze, the two-headed beast roared a few times before returning to the Hun Yuan Tong Xin ring to heal.</p><p>The old woman, clutching the broken copper mirror, stood there with a dull, dark expression, seemingly lost in thought.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around. Golden light and demonic energy still lingered in the air, quickly dissipating. He searched for the others. The Yin female cultivator was gone.</p><p>But in the distance, a silver gleam flickered amidst the aftershocks, revealing the Di male cultivator. He had survived, though equally battered.</p><p>“Su Dao You, where are you going?”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the old couple had stood for a while before turning to go back. Surprised, he called out to them.</p><p>The old woman gave a wry smile, her voice hoarse. “I spent years preparing for this journey, investing countless efforts and resources into two treasures to counter the dangers within.  I had high hopes, but both were destroyed here. Going further would be futile, a waste of life. Fortunately, my lifespan is sufficient to wait until the next opening of the Seven Killing Hall. I'll go ahead. I wish you, Qin Dao You, success.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>The treasure lay just ahead, only a final step away.</p><p>Such an unforeseen turn of events was unimaginable.  If he were in her shoes, facing this sudden reversal of fortune, he wouldn't know what to say either.</p><p>Just as the old woman was about to leave, the teleportation array lit up again.</p><p>The Great Shaman and the Demon Lord were fighting near the stone platform, seemingly unconcerned about destroying the array.</p><p>In fact, when the shockwave hit, a green light flickered from the stone platform, effectively blocking the impact.  The clash between two Yuan Ying late-stage cultivators hadn't even damaged the platform in the slightest.  The teleportation array remained intact.</p><p>Seeing the array reactivate, Qin Sang and the others were startled, like startled birds, retreating instinctively.</p><p>Then, more than a dozen figures emerged from the array. These individuals possessed power second only to the Great Shaman and the Demon Lord—all Yuan Ying masters!  There were both members of the Wu tribe and human cultivators. Some fought amongst themselves after exiting; others immediately took flight, pursuing others.</p><p>After they all vanished from sight, Qin Sang and the others slowly exhaled.</p><p>“I wonder what treasures those two tribes found up there to cause such a blatant fight. Su Dao You, don't you want to go take a look? There might be opportunities.”</p><p>Qin Sang turned to ask.</p><p>The old woman shook her head, bid farewell to Qin Sang, and resolutely departed.</p><p>Seeing that no other Yuan Ying masters appeared, Qin Sang activated his flying magic weapon, heading towards the teleportation array.</p><p>Just as he was about to step onto the array, he heard someone calling from behind. The Di male cultivator invited him to go together.  Qin Sang had no intention of teaming up, nodded briefly, and stepped onto the array, teleporting away.</p><p>The Di male cultivator arrived at the edge of the stone platform, frowning at the empty teleportation array.  Finally, he shook his head and stepped onto it.</p><p>…</p><p>The seventh level of the Celestial Tower.  This is the highest level reachable by the Cang Lang Hai cultivators.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the Celestial Tower is much taller than seven levels; higher levels must exist.  However, over the years, countless Yuan Ying masters have explored the seventh level extensively, failing to discover any passage or teleportation array leading to higher floors.</p><p>This is precisely why the ancient corpse falling from the Celestial Tower's peak caused such a stir. Some believe that finding the corpse will unlock the secrets of the Celestial Tower, possibly yielding ancient treasures.</p><p>The first six levels can be considered trials for the foundational and core formation stages.  Logically, the seventh level should have puppets comparable to Nascent Soul masters.</p><p>But this wasn't the case.</p><p>The seventh level was drastically different from the previous six.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the teleportation array, cautiously observing his surroundings.  Seeing no other Nascent Soul masters battling nearby, he relaxed slightly and surveyed his environment.</p><p>The seventh level was also a shattered space.  But instead of ruins of ancient brick halls, it was a collection of island-like mountain fragments, silently floating in the void, motionless.</p><p>It was clear that these were mountain fragments; some were parts of cliffs, others solitary patches of forest. Most fragments had stone steps running from top to bottom.  The steps could be pieced together, indicating they were once a single entity.</p><p>These fragments weren't uniformly spread; they were scattered above, below, and all around Qin Sang, varying greatly in size.</p><p>Ancient cultivators might have sealed a colossal divine sword within the Celestial Tower!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't imagine the cultivation level required to accomplish such a feat.</p><p>Most of the mountain fragments were simply solitary rocks and forests, nothing extraordinary. Only a very few showed anything unusual.  Some glowed with restrictive light, others concealed ancient halls within forests, or revealed ancient cultivator caves in broken cliffs—all imbued with mystery and inspiring longing, yet also hiding unknown dangers.</p><p>Qin Sang produced a detailed map he had purchased at great expense—the most detailed one available.</p><p>The seventh level's space remained constant, making the map useful.  He located himself on the map and then focused on a fragment shaped like an isolated valley at the map's top.</p><p>The map's annotations were sparse and unrelated to treasures. Only a few cultivators dared to explore the Celestial Tower and achieve success; related secrets rarely surfaced, leaving Qin Sang to explore on his own.</p><p>However, one location was clearly marked: the valley.  It was supposedly recognized by Nascent Soul masters as the most likely location of a teleportation array leading to higher levels of the tower, but no one had ever verified it.  Not for lack of trying, but simply because it was impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang chose this location first. Da Wu Zhu and the others had already left, allowing him to freely investigate whether, as in Ziwei Palace, the *Chapter on Cultivating the Soul Sword* would open a passage for him.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the map and leaped into action.</p>
