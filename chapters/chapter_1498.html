<h1>## Chapter 1489: The Ghoul General (4k)</h1><p>Gluttonous Maw Lake was situated between two mountains.</p><p>The lake surface was long and narrow.</p><p>The rocky walls on either side of the lakebed were clearly visible, uneven, with bizarrely shaped rocks jutting out.</p><p>The water was clear, yet impossibly deep.</p><p>The bottom of the lake was pitch black, resembling a vast maw capable of devouring everything.</p><p>Indeed, that was its nature; the seemingly tranquil lakebed was not only riddled with ancient restrictions but also concealed a strange suction force. Anything foreign, including Immortal cultivators, that fell into its pull met a fate of complete disappearance.</p><p>No one knew where these people were drawn to.</p><p>Hence, the lake earned the name 'Gluttonous Maw.'</p><p>In attempts to explore the secrets hidden within Gluttonous Maw Lake, Profound Sky Palace had lost many experts, but without reward, and it was gradually abandoned.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli ascended Floating Sky Mountain and stood on the shore of Gluttonous Maw Lake.</p><p>Liuli pointed towards the depths of Gluttonous Maw Lake, describing the characteristics of the restrictions and suction force to Qin Sang. The two quickly formulated a plan and, without hesitation, plunged into the lake.</p><p>Invisible restrictions drifted in the water.</p><p>The route Liuli chose was extremely winding, but her descent speed was rapid, indicating a deep understanding of this place.</p><p>Qin Sang manipulated his sword to protect himself, following behind Liuli. At this moment, he did not need to intervene at all; Liuli alternated between urging the Phoenix-Shaped Treasure Sword and another magical artifact, dealing with the situation with remarkable ease.</p><p>After descending to an unknown depth, Liuli suddenly stopped and transmitted her voice, "It's here!"</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze. The lakebed was pitch black, and his naked eyes could only see a faint light barrier formed by an ancient restriction to the left.</p><p>However, his divine sense told him that there was a suction force right next to this restriction. The suction force was very calm, without affecting the lake water, but it gave Qin Sang an extremely dangerous feeling.</p><p>This was the most dangerous place.</p><p>The power of the ancient restriction was strong, and the most troublesome thing was the mysterious suction force. Liuli needed to borrow Qin Sang's power to pass through, while she could handle other places alone.</p><p>Qin Sang showed a look of contemplation, pondered for a moment, and summoned his External Incarnation, saying, "Let's begin!"</p><p>Liuli glanced at the Incarnation and nodded lightly.</p><p>The Phoenix-Shaped Treasure Sword shone brightly with sword energy (sword qi), and she merged with her sword, heading straight for the ancient restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang's actions were not slow either. At the instant Liuli made her move, he directly urged the Gold Submergence Sword to transform into a Sword Formation, using the power of the Sword Formation to resist the suction force.</p><p>At the same time, the External Incarnation raised both palms in a gesture of support, and two strands of cold energy transformed into Ice Dragons, rushing towards the direction Liuli had departed.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Phoenix-Shaped Treasure Sword pierced the ancient restriction, and chaotic power erupted in the water, surging in all directions.</p><p>The suction force adjacent to the ancient restriction was immediately disturbed and awakened from its slumber. Like a roused lion, it suddenly burst forth with an extremely astonishing aura.</p><p>At the same time, the Seven Souls Killing Formation descended, and the power of the Sword Formation clashed head-on with the suction force.</p><p>Liuli's eyes flashed with a dim blue light, and Glacial Soul Divine Light spread into the ancient restriction. In an instant, a layer of blue permeated the light barrier, making it appear as fragile as ice.</p><p>'Zheng!'</p><p>The light of the Gold Submergence Sword grew increasingly brilliant.</p><p>The suction force rioted, and the Sword Formation failed to completely block it.</p><p>At this moment, the External Incarnation's divine ability came into play. The two Ice Dragons converged behind Liuli, condensing into an Ice Mirror, blocking the suction force.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Cracks quickly spread across the Ice Mirror, and it ultimately shattered with a crash. The fragments were immediately sucked away and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>However, Liuli had already successfully broken through the ancient restriction and entered the other side of the light barrier. Seeing that Liuli was safe, Qin Sang immediately retracted his sword and retreated, taking the Incarnation out of Gluttonous Maw Lake.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang did not stop but hurried towards the Cleansing Pool on the other side of Floating Sky Mountain.</p><p>His figure traveled through the mountains and forests.</p><p>Here, the jungle was lush, and the vegetation was secluded. Unfortunately, one could not hear the chirping of insects or the roars of beasts. The sense of deathly stillness was difficult to dispel.</p><p>During his journey, Qin Sang occasionally discovered a spirit herb (spiritual medicine). Their grade might not be high, but many were rare spirit herbs (spiritual medicine) that were difficult to find outside, truly a treasure land.</p><p>However, Profound Sky Palace should not have the energy to collect these herbs now.</p><p>He just did not know how Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu planned to deal with Old Man Chaotic Devil and Sky Roc Great Sage.</p><p>The people Old Man Chaotic Devil brought in were clearly a motley crew, each acting on their own. Old Man Chaotic Devil summoned them to restrain Profound Sky Palace and disrupt the situation, so Profound Sky Palace would naturally not fall for it.</p><p>But Old Man Chaotic Devil and Sky Roc Great Sage, plus their confidants, were also a very tricky force.</p><p>Whether their goal was to force Profound Sky Palace to share the holy land, or whether they had other plots, was still unknown.</p><p>Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu did not seem anxious. Did they not know that the holy land also hid secrets, or were they confident that Old Man Chaotic Devil and Sky Roc Great Sage could not succeed?</p><p>Thoughts whirled rapidly in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang's figure suddenly stopped, looking towards the direction of the Cleansing Pool, his brow furrowed slightly.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool was located in a valley on Floating Sky Mountain, shrouded in mist year-round. It was said that no means could peer into the interior, and entrants must abide by the rules of the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>At the entrance of the valley stood a wordless memorial archway.</p><p>On the mountains outside the Cleansing Pool, pavilions stood in rows, and ancient halls stretched continuously. Presumably, this place was once very lively, but now more than 90% had collapsed, with broken walls and ruins everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang had just seen an unusual light flashing at the entrance of the Cleansing Pool. Having been delayed at Gluttonous Maw Lake for a while, two people had actually arrived before him.</p><p>One of them was a demon clan (monster race). Qin Sang recognized this demon to be Yellow Browed Demon King, a mid-Nascent Soul (middle-stage Transformation) stage demon. It was said that his true form was a weasel, and his strength should not be underestimated.</p><p>The other person was also a stranger.</p><p>This person was clad in armor from head to toe, covering his face tightly, revealing only his eyes.</p><p>With such a special disguise, his identity was not difficult to guess -- Ghoul General, another great demon of the Boundless Sea!</p><p>Qin Sang had noticed before that Old Man Chaotic Devil and Sky Roc Great Sage had clear goals, heading straight for the depths of the holy land. These two did not go with them, but instead turned to the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>As long as one met the requirements of the Cleansing Pool, one could enter directly.</p><p>They obviously did not meet the requirements, but they were unaware and thought they had not found the correct path, and were frantically attacking the memorial archway.</p><p>Qin Sang did not want to waste time entangled with these two.</p><p>It was also not worth using the Solar Divine Tree for them.</p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly (Celestial Eye Butterfly) conveyed a thought. Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, and he already had a plan.</p><p>...</p><p>"We've been attacking for so long, and the memorial archway remains unmoved. There must be secrets hidden here that we don't know. That old devil must have concealed a lot..."</p><p>After another fruitless attempt, Ghoul General was at a loss what to do with the memorial archway, and his tone turned cold.</p><p>Yellow Browed Demon King shook his head, "It may not be intentional concealment. The Cleansing Pool must be the most valued place of Profound Sky Palace. It is already extremely rare that Old Man Chaotic Devil was able to find out that this place has some benefit for Nascent Soul (Transformation Stage) stage cultivators."</p><p>He stared into the depths of the mist, his long eyebrows twitching, playing with a strand of yellow smoke between his fingers, racking his brains for a way to break it.</p><p>"It seems we can only capture a Profound Sky Palace cultivator to ask clearly. However, these guys are timid as mice, rarely alone, and difficult to attack..."</p><p>As he spoke, Ghoul General suddenly turned his head to look at the distant forest and let out a strange laugh, "Speak of the devil, come out for me!"</p><p>The last half of the sentence became an explosive roar.</p><p>The armor on Ghoul General's body rattled, and four streams of black light flew out from the gaps in the armor plates, landing in four directions, transforming into four armored warrior statue.</p><p>The four statues opened their eyes together, looking towards the forest, shooting out eight black lights.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>That piece of forest was blasted apart on the spot, smoke and dust filling the air.</p><p>A figure flashed out, it was Qin Sang.</p><p>"The two of you should not waste your energy, you are both people without fate, you cannot force it," facing the two great devils, Qin Sang showed no fear, saying in a profound and mysterious way.</p><p>Ghoul General sneered, "So you are a person of fate? Then I'll refine you into a puppet, and this General will also be a person of fate!"</p><p>Ghoul General and Yellow Browed Demon King swayed, about to surround him.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed and summoned the Gold Submergence Sword, pretending to attack, suddenly looked at the ancient building ruins not far from the valley entrance, and shouted loudly, "Fellow Daoist Yue, why haven't you made your move yet, what are you waiting for!"</p><p>After the reminder, Ghoul General and Yellow Browed Demon King realized that there was something wrong there. Someone had sneaked close, and they were completely unaware.</p><p>The two roared and immediately changed the direction of their attack.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The remaining pavilions completely collapsed, and a figure flew out from them, narrowly dodging the attack, looking very disheveled.</p><p>It was the Yue surname cultivator who attended Qin Sang's wedding banquet with Shang Lu.</p><p>He glared at Qin Sang hatefully. If Qin Sang had not revealed his whereabouts, he would have been able to approach a little closer and take advantage of his opponent's carelessness to force his way into the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>At the same time, he was also somewhat horrified. His concealment divine ability was a secret art passed down from Heavenly Mountain. The two demons were completely unaware, but he was easily seen through by this person.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded in greeting.</p><p>There were probably not many Nascent Soul (Transformation Stage) stage cultivators who could hide from both him and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly (Celestial Eye Butterfly).</p><p>"Where is Hall Master Shang?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Just now, he and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly (Celestial Eye Butterfly) had carefully searched but did not find Shang Lu.</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang quite a bit. Could it be that Shang Lu knew he had no hope of defeating him and simply gave up?</p><p>Otherwise, why would this person come alone?</p><p>The Yue surname cultivator snorted coldly, unwilling to answer, coldly said, "One person each! Yue has long heard of Yellow Browed Demon King's poisonous smoke, killing countless disciples of my Profound Sky Palace, I will take revenge for them!"</p><p>When the holy land was opened, the restrictions of the Cleansing Pool would be activated.</p><p>Time was limited. Once they missed the opportunity, no one would benefit.</p><p>Although he and Qin Sang were competitors, they could only endure their displeasure and join forces.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond, the Yue surname cultivator immediately sacrificed a Python Banner (Snake Flag) and summoned a Heavenly Mountain Snow Python, rushing towards Yellow Browed Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang did not know much about either of these demons and did not care who he dealt with.</p><p>The Yue surname cultivator had chosen Yellow Browed Demon King, so Qin Sang had no choice but to take the initiative to confront Ghoul General.</p><p>"Arrogant!"</p><p>Ghoul General was so angry that he laughed, the scales on his body opening and closing, and dozens of streams of black light flew out.</p><p>Each stream of black light contained an armored warrior puppet, which, after landing, cooperated with the four statues to form a strange formation, its sharp edge pointing directly at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Puppet Formation?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was strange.</p><p>It looked similar to the Judge's Corpse Formation in some ways. The strength of each puppet was not strong, but when combined, they could become a unified whole, their auras connected to each other, and their strength soared.</p><p>Little did he know that after the Heavenly Eye Butterfly (Celestial Eye Butterfly) advanced again, he was least afraid of such means. Even the most hidden changes could not escape under the Heavenly Eye (Celestial Eye) divine ability.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, manipulating his sword to slash quickly, secretly urging his divine sense, and cooperating with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly (Celestial Eye Butterfly) to break the battle formation.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>As soon as the sword light was slashed out.</p><p>The puppet battle formation shone brightly with black light, condensing into a baleful axe in mid-air, extremely fierce, chopping towards the sword light.</p><p>At the same time, the armored warrior puppets stepped forward together, their baleful aura soaring to the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Gold Submergence Sword to hang upside down above his head, a strange look flashing in his eyes, and actually did not retreat but advanced, taking the initiative to rush into the puppet battle formation.</p><p>This move greatly exceeded Ghoul General's expectations.</p><p>He was slightly stunned, and even more angry, stomping his feet heavily, and the four statues came to life, like great generals of the battle formation, leading their soldiers to evolve a killing formation, strangling Qin Sang.</p><p>In an instant, the puppet formation changed greatly.</p><p>But in the eyes of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly (Celestial Eye Butterfly), everything had a pattern to follow.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled leisurely in the battle formation, calmly urging the Gold Submergence Sword, shooting out streams of sword light, slashing at different positions, each one subtle and perfect.</p><p>The battle formation immediately showed a sense of lag.</p><p>The reason why he could see the key to the puppet battle formation so quickly.</p><p>The first reason was naturally due to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's (Celestial Eye Butterfly's) efforts.</p><p>The second was that Qin Sang had learned a lot of knowledge about the way of puppets from Senior Apprentice-Sister Qingjun. Through constant exposure, he could not be said to be proficient in this path, but his vision was definitely not bad.</p><p>He could clearly feel that, in the way of puppets, Ghoul General was still some distance away from his senior apprentice-sister!</p><p>Ghoul General was shocked. Before he had time to make amends, an ear-piercing sword hum came from within the battle formation, and several puppets shattered in response!</p><p>Ghoul General did not feel heartache at the loss of these puppets.</p><p>At this moment, a statue puppet was exposed to the sword's edge.</p><p>Ghoul General never expected that the puppet battle formation would be broken so easily. Although this formation was not his strongest divine ability, it was his means of fame, known as an army formed by one person.</p><p>In front of this person, it was so vulnerable!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The Gold Submergence Sword locked onto a statue puppet, accurately hitting the puppet's chest.</p><p>This place was precisely the puppet's weakness.</p><p>The statue puppet's body immediately stiffened, and its chest was pierced, forming a hollow, and a blazing white light surged out. The entire puppet began to collapse from here.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was torn apart!</p><p>Ghoul General was furious, heavily patting his brow, and the armor on his brow cracked, revealing a vertical eye.</p><p>There was no pupil inside the vertical eye, only a black shadow.</p><p>The vertical pupil cracked open, and a human-shaped black shadow was about to come out, its facial features distorted, seemingly extremely painful.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang sensed something unusual, subconsciously looked over, and a solemn look appeared in his eyes, actually feeling a threat from the black shadow.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>Several spots of light appeared outside Floating Sky Mountain. Looking at the direction they came from, they were Profound Sky Palace cultivators, probably including elders or hall masters.</p><p>The four people in the battle all noticed the distant escape light.</p><p>Although Ghoul General was full of anger, he did not lose his composure. His opponent had not used any means yet, and a few simple swords had broken his puppet battle formation.</p><p>Old Man Chaotic Devil and Sky Roc Great Sage were not here. If a few more people came from Profound Sky Palace, they would be in danger instead.</p><p>If he used his trump card but did not get any benefits, he might as well retreat.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Ghoul General glared at Qin Sang angrily, forcibly pressed the black shadow back, shouted at Yellow Browed Demon King, and was about to leave.</p><p>"Leave all the puppets behind!"</p><p>Qin Sang did not plan to continue entangled with Ghoul General, and fully urged the *Azure Bamboo Sword Manual*, his sword transformed into thousands, submerging the entire puppet battle formation.</p><p>"I'll remember you!"</p><p>Ghoul General left this harsh sentence, only taking away less than half of the puppets.</p><p>When Qin Sang collected the puppets abandoned by Ghoul General, preparing to take them back for research, he found that the Yue surname cultivator was very alert and had already entered the Cleansing Pool one step ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head to look at the distant escape light, and no longer hesitated, his figure flashed, came to the bottom of the memorial archway.</p><p>He met the requirements and was not hindered in any way.</p><p>At the moment of stepping into the memorial archway, Qin Sang suddenly felt an invisible pressure descending, and all the surrounding scenery disappeared, leaving only white mist.</p>
