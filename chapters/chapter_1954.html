<h1>Chapter 1945: Thunder in the Palm</h1><p>The Taiyi Leigang Talisman, when activated, shakes the heavens and the earth!</p><p>A bright circle above Qin Sang’s head blazed, seemingly releasing endless thunder.  The ambient spiritual energy surged, and bolts of lightning sprang forth from the void, transforming the desolate countryside into a sea of thunder.  Thunder filled the heavens and earth, targeting Qingyuan.</p><p>Qingyuan seemed to be submerged in a boiling cauldron of lightning.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>Even brighter lightning erupted from the plasma. While the Taiyi Leigang Talisman shares its origins with the Taiyi Leidrill Talisman, it’s no mere upgrade. Instead of a few thunder drills, the talisman manifested eight thunder dragons!</p><p>Silver thunder dragons ravenously devoured the surrounding lightning, growing larger and more powerful in an instant. Their tails touched the heavens, their heads brushed the earth—celestial dragons descended from above, their roars echoing as thunder.</p><p>Qingyuan was surrounded. Compared to the colossal dragons, he was insignificant, especially with eight of them!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>With a deafening thunderclap, the eight thunder dragons charged at Qingyuan. The attack was overwhelmingly powerful because Qin Sang, without reservation, unleashed his full power, manipulating the spiritual energy into thunder.</p><p>Life-or-death battles between cultivators at the Void Refinement stage involve the contention of spiritual energy, but even then, one wouldn't dare act recklessly.  More spiritual energy isn't always better.  Without complete control and subtle manipulation, it reveals flaws to an opponent of the same level; they could seize an opportunity, even deprive one of their energy, rendering their techniques useless.</p><p>A fight between cautious cultivators would rarely have this much grandeur. However, since they agreed to a test of skill, there’s no need for concern. They'd already sealed off the area; the commotion wouldn't reach the outside.</p><p>The thunder dragons merged. Where Qingyuan stood, only a blinding flash of lightning was visible; his body was completely engulfed. Only Qin Sang could see through the lightning, 'observing' what lay within.</p><p>From the moment the Taiyi Leigang Talisman erupted, Qingyuan maintained his hand seals, hovering three meters above the ground, motionless. He seemed to have cast no technique, but Qin Sang knew the secret lay in his hand seals.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed in understanding. It was a talisman! A talisman whose form was refined to its ultimate, a spiritual talisman. Though Qingyuan didn't have a talisman altar or imprinted seals, yet he still produced a talisman effortlessly!</p><p>Talisman against talisman!</p><p>This showed Qingyuan possessed astonishing skill in talismanry!</p><p>Lightning struck Qingyuan.  His palms glowed a light blue, followed by the sound of crashing waves.  A river flowed out of the void, then condensed into four water mirrors, encircling him.</p><p>*Plop! Plop! Plop!*</p><p>Lightning struck the water mirrors like it hit a water film. Thunder possesses supreme power and strength.  The surface of the mirrors, incredibly soft, vibrated repeatedly, yet with their yielding nature, they formed an unyielding barrier.</p><p>Crackling sounds surrounded Qingyuan, lightning flashed wildly, but no matter how fierce the attacks, they couldn't pierce the mirrors or harm him.</p><p>Clearly, the Taiyi Leigang Talisman alone wouldn't repel Qingyuan.  Qin Sang had anticipated this. As the thunder dragons' power waned, he silently chanted an incantation, activating another talisman.</p><p>This was also a third-order thunder talisman, the Xinyan Duan Hong Talisman, superior to the Taiyi Leigang Talisman.  Qin Sang hadn't completely mastered it and couldn’t create the divine talisman imprint, resulting in slower activation compared to the Taiyi Leigang Talisman.  However, with the talisman altar's assistance, even without the divine imprint, his speed was still unmatched.</p><p>Just as the thunder dragons' power neared its end, the Xinyan Duan Hong Talisman was ready.</p><p>Suddenly, the spiritual energy surged again, dark clouds gathered overhead, and the sky turned gloomy.  This darkness lasted only a moment before fiery light pierced the void.</p><p>"Swish swish swish…"</p><p>Falling from the clouds wasn't rain, but fiery masses.</p><p>A rain of fire! Countless meteors plummeted from the sky.  This scene was familiar; the Liujin Huoling Lei Zhao also produced similar phenomena.</p><p>The Xinyan Duan Hong Talisman summoned boundless thunder and fire, but instead of striking the ground, they coalesced in midair, transforming into a fiery rainbow of thunder.</p><p>The rainbow pierced the sky, hurtling towards Qingyuan with terrifying power, seemingly tearing a hole in the heavens, leaving a trail of black smoke. The thick smoke obscured the rainbow itself.</p><p>If the city hadn't been sealed off, the people of Jien County would only have seen the sky filled with black smoke and a fleeting glimpse of the initial fiery rainbow—the name "Broken Rainbow" originates from this.</p><p>The power and spectacle of the Smoky Rainbow Talisman far surpassed the previous attack. Four water mirrors were insufficient defense. Qingyuan formed his fingers into a sword, pointing towards the heavens.</p><p>A swirling light formed between his fingers, heavy and profound, teeming with boundless potential.  Suddenly, it shot towards the sky!</p><p>Another talisman!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The yellow light pierced the dark clouds. Qin Sang felt a tremor shake the heavens and earth, as if an immense force had struck the void.</p><p>Suddenly, Qingyuan was enveloped in shadow.</p><p>A jet-black stele fell from the sky.  It wasn't particularly tall, less than thirty feet, but incredibly heavy, piercing the dark clouds upon impact.</p><p>At that moment, the fiery rainbow approached, and the stele smashed into it.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The black smoke exploded.</p><p>The rainbow, though not completely destroyed, was blocked.</p><p>Space seemed to be suppressed by the stele; the following lightning and fire couldn't surpass it, only surrounding it.</p><p>More and more lightning and fire gathered around the stele, licking at it fiercely.</p><p>The sky burned crimson, yet the stele remained unmelted.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised, didn't even glance at it, and attacked again!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The Jade-Clear Summoning Thunder Talisman!</p><p>With the heavenly thunder came a torrent of lightning and fire.</p><p>The Golden Fire Bell Thunder Summoning followed swiftly.</p><p>At this point, the Smoky Rainbow Talisman’s summoned lightning and fire were at their peak, suddenly surging back.  The two flows of fiery power merged.</p><p>The Smoky Rainbow Talisman created the optimal environment, and the Golden Fire Bell Thunder Summoning absorbed the power, its might boosted to a terrifying level.</p><p>This was a principle Qin Sang had realized after studying thunder techniques: similar talismans, when used in coordination, could achieve far greater power; the same applied to diagrams.</p><p>But it wasn't over. Amidst the raging thunder and fire, the Five Thunder Heart Seal Talisman appeared!</p><p>Three talismans unleashed, their thunderous power unmatched!</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qingyuan's eyes flashed, his finger a brush as he painted a talisman in the air. It formed in an instant.</p><p>The talisman's shape was unique, possessing a strange mystique, like flowing water, or a banner swaying in the breeze, or perhaps a wisp of wind itself.</p><p>The talisman flew on its own and dissipated, while Qingyuan's fingertip continued to create new ones.</p><p>Each talisman was different, yet shared a similar essence.</p><p>Talisman after talisman appeared and vanished, finally forming a faint outline in the air: a green pouch.</p><p>The pouch's mouth was slightly closed, but against the onslaught of thunder, it opened abruptly, unleashing an immense suction force.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>A near-substantial wind was visible at the pouch's mouth.</p><p>It seemed like a bottomless bag, capable of swallowing anything, including thunder!</p><p>Both the power of the three talismans and the stray lightning in the void were swallowed.</p><p>In an instant, the chaotic heavens stilled, leaving only the pouch, slowly descending before Qingyuan, bulging with its contents.</p><p>Qin Sang stared, astonished. This attack, aside from not using the Azure Luan True Thunder, was nearly his most powerful thunder technique.</p><p>He had witnessed the Thunder Master use the Five Thunder Heart Seal, and understood it deeply.</p><p>This attack would make even a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator wary.</p><p>And it was swallowed by a pouch, in an almost comical manner.</p><p>Qin Sang made no further move.  Continuing the exchange was pointless.</p><p>*Buzz buzz buzz…*</p><p>The pouch writhed, muffled sounds emanating from within.</p><p>Qingyuan's eyes were closed, seemingly suppressing the thunderous power within, though he appeared calm.</p><p>However, Qin Sang quickly noticed something amiss.</p><p>After about a minute, Qingyuan gently tapped the pouch, and a bolt of lightning erupted.</p><p>The lightning twisted, emitting a familiar aura to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Jade-Clear Summoning Thunder Talisman!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed.  Even more shocking, Qingyuan’s technique didn't just contain a single talisman but also faintly carried the aura of the High God's Thunder Court!</p><p>Talismans carry the Dharma, and the Dharma is the foundation of the talisman path!</p><p>How did Qingyuan do this?</p><p>Qin Sang was deeply shocked, speechless, when Qingyuan tapped the pouch again, releasing a ball of lightning and fire.</p><p>As expected, it manifested into the Golden Fire Bell Thunder Summoning, equally carrying the aura of the Dharma!</p><p>Then Qingyuan stopped moving.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly awaited an explanation.  After three hours of patient waiting, Qing Yuan finally moved, giving the windbag another pat.  The remaining thunder returned to the world, manifesting before Qin Sang as the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal.  Qing Yuan's skill with this talisman was now on par with Qin Sang's.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected Qing Yuan's inability to fully utilize the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal was connected to him, as Qing Yuan hadn't yet completely mastered it!  Most astonishing was the magical energy emanating from the thunder talismans.  Qing Yuan was actually using these three talismans to reverse-engineer the Gao Shang Shenxiao Seal – though he didn't fully succeed, the attempt was incredibly impressive.  After all, the Gao Shang Shenxiao Seal was one of the three great seals of the Daoist court, a culmination of countless generations of scholarly efforts!</p><p>"Truly exquisite!" Qing Yuan exhaled softly, expressing sincere admiration.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, his expression numb. The person before him was far more powerful than he'd imagined!</p><p>"Friend Daoist... have you previously practiced Daoist techniques?" Qin Sang asked, his voice strained. He wondered if addressing the other as "Friend Daoist" was slightly inappropriate.</p><p>Qing Yuan nodded slightly. "I've encountered some fragments, but the renowned main tradition of the Thunder Department – the Gao Shang Shenxiao Seal – has been lost for a long time. I've always regretted never seeing it, but today my wish is finally fulfilled."</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent again.</p><p>"Unfortunately, Daoist techniques are deeply intertwined with scriptures and cannot be fully deduced solely from talismans. However, I'm very satisfied to have witnessed the splendor of the true Thunder Department tradition of the Talisman School today. Thank you, Daoist Master."</p><p>As Qing Yuan spoke, he noticed Qin Sang's expression and seemed to misunderstand. He apologetically added, "I was momentarily captivated and couldn't help but study and imitate it. I apologize for my impetuous behavior."</p><p>Was that imitation? It looked more like outright theft! But was there ever such a brazen display of theft? To instantly learn another's Daoist techniques – such terrifying ability! Who would dare use their arts in front of such a person?</p><p>Qing Yuan flicked his finger, sending a beam of light towards Qin Sang.  "One shouldn't only receive; this Palm-Held Thunder Observation technique is a gift, Daoist Master."</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, but after hearing the technique's function, he immediately caught the light.</p><p>"This is not a destructive technique, but rather quite profound. With Palm-Held Thunder Observation, aside from calamity thunder, all kinds of divine thunder can be contained within the palm. By observing it mentally, one can quickly understand the nature of thunder..." Qing Yuan explained.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't refuse this technique! He hadn't used his Azure Bird True Thunder when using the thunder talismans earlier. Firstly, he didn't want to reveal his trump card; secondly, he couldn't fully control the Azure Bird True Thunder yet. If the power of this Palm-Held Thunder Observation wasn't exaggerated, it would be invaluable to him.  Clearly, Qing Yuan had sensed the unique thunder power within him, understood the problem, and offered a solution.</p><p>Qin Sang held the light, hesitated, then said, "I can invoke the power of the [Daoist] altar to create a token for you, Friend Daoist. If you find the Wanfa Zong altar, it will let them know that the Talisman School's legacy still thrives in this vast world! However, I don't know how effective it will be, or if the Talisman School will even see you..."</p><p>Qing Yuan's strength was unfathomable; he might really find the Daoist court. This would not only curry favor with Qing Yuan but also allow Qin Sang to send a message. The Daoist court and the First Sword Servant were certainly still in contact. If they'd pinpointed the Sword Pavilion's location, they might actively seek him out to retrieve the Earth-Slaying Sword fragment and cultivation techniques.</p><p>Qing Yuan was naturally delighted. The worst-case scenario was finding the Wanfa Zong altar only to be rejected by the Talisman School.  This token would ensure he could speak with authority.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a piece of spirit jade from his Qianjun Ring, channeled the power of the Gao Shang Shenxiao Seal, and left a mark inside the jade, refining it into a special artifact.  It would certainly be sensed upon approaching the Daoist court.</p><p>"Thank you! Daoist Master, take care!" Qing Yuan bowed slightly, then without lingering, strode south.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Qing Yuan leave, feeling conflicted. His feelings towards Qing Yuan were contradictory. He'd been fortunate to meet such a powerful figure, and should have sought instruction, yet he felt hesitant, unwilling to press the matter. He couldn't take Qing Yuan's approachability for granted.  He imagined that this was probably how those lower-level cultivators he'd met on his travels felt.</p><p>Looking around, Qin Sang thought, Yundou Tian and Luohun Yuan surely didn't know that a mysterious powerful cultivator had passed near their sect.</p><p>"What a carefree immortal!" Qin Sang exclaimed involuntarily.  Of course, he knew that everything depended on Qing Yuan's overwhelming strength.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang pondered for a long time. His consciousness touched the light, and a cultivation technique instantly flooded his mind. Qin Sang sat down and remained there for a day and a night before waking up. He activated his flying ability and returned to Qingyang Temple. </p>
