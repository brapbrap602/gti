<h1>Chapter 1588: The Gu Manual</h1><p>Chapter 1588: The Gu Manual</p><p>Su Zinan returned to the Chinan Islands and left that night, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The two attempts to enter the Wuwang Hall seemed like farces.  First, the Eight Scenic Spots and Ganlu Temple, then Su Zinan—all suffered losses in Wuwang Hall, yet none even breached the outer turbulence.</p><p>However, Wuwang Hall is not everyone's primary concern now.</p><p>The daring actions of three Nascent Soul heirs, along with the final conversation between Su Zinan and Crane-Gao True Person, fueled the already rampant rumors.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know if Su Zinan was searching for someone, but felt his actions suggested a desire for chaos.  Perhaps both.</p><p>The storm subsided. Qin Sang didn't stay long in the Chinan Islands, returning to the Central Plains.</p><p>On board the ship…</p><p>Qin Sang sealed the cabin with a restriction and took out the belongings of the grotesque-faced man's disciple.  The capture had been hasty; perhaps clues could be found here.</p><p>Besides the spatial pouch, Qin Sang also seized his spirit beast pouch.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the spatial pouch with little hope. The first things he saw were jade bottles of various colors.  He'd seen the grotesque-faced man's disciple use them; they contained a variety of potent poisons.</p><p>The Southern Barbarian states are rife with miasma, so collecting these poisons wasn't difficult.  Individually, they had little effect on Yuan Ying cultivators. Only when combined with secret techniques, as the grotesque-faced man's disciple had done, did they pose a threat.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, he encountered Qin Sang, and Fatty Silkworm had a hearty meal, now fast asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang's knowledge of poisons was limited. He set aside the jade bottles and examined the remaining poison pills.  He then activated his spiritual sense to break the restrictions on the spirit beast pouch. Inside, a dazzling array of poisonous insects filled his vision.</p><p>Their sheer number was astonishing.  Unlike the Five-Colored Poisonous Spider and the poisonous scorpions, these were mostly naturally occurring poisonous insects.  Several, however, were hard to identify, their cultivation levels at the second and third transformations.  </p><p>Rare insects were a minority.</p><p>Nevertheless, cultivating so many high-level spirit insects wasn't easy.</p><p>Qin Sang opened a jar.  Without bothering Fatty Silkworm, he enveloped his palm in protective true energy and grabbed an insect.</p><p>It was a colorful moth, with vibrantly colored wings and a gray body. He could trace similarities to three types of poisonous moths from his memory, their characteristics all combined in this single moth.</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang couldn't be certain of its species.</p><p>"The three characteristics are all very distinct. It can't be a coincidence. Is this a newly cultivated Gu insect?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. He had previously suspected the Five-Colored Poisonous Spider may have been bred using Gu techniques.  Seeing these insects, he was certain.</p><p>However, the Five-Colored Poisonous Spider was already fully formed, making it impossible to discern the number of insects fused into it, while this moth was just beginning.</p><p>"Interesting.  Using the method of raising Gu, merging various insect traits to enhance strength. I wonder if it can be replicated in other spirit insects…"</p><p>Qin Sang continued to search the spatial pouch.</p><p>With a 'rustle', dozens of jade slips appeared on the table. Qin Sang examined them one by one.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man and his disciple were most skilled in wood-elemental divine abilities, but Qin Sang found nothing related to their fundamental Dao. Only some methods for refining wood-elemental treasures were present, nothing of importance.</p><p>On reflection, it made sense.  The grotesque-faced man could place restrictions on his disciple's Nascent Soul, so he certainly wouldn't allow him to carry important items.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>A jade slip caught Qin Sang's attention as his spiritual sense swept over it.  He picked it up and examined it closely.</p><p>"The Gu Manual, a legacy of Wan Du Mountain!"</p><p>Wan Du Mountain is a superlative sect in the Barbarian State, renowned alongside Taiyue Gate in the Southern State. As the name suggests, Wan Du Mountain cultivators excel in the art of poison, benefiting greatly from their location.</p><p>The Barbarian State is sparsely populated, with many spirit insects, and some Wan Du Mountain cultivators raise spirit insects and excel at insect control.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously suspected that the grotesque-faced man and his disciple might be from Wan Du Mountain, but Wan Du Mountain had no renowned wood-elemental experts, so he couldn't confirm it.</p><p>After reading the Gu Manual, Qin Sang was somewhat disappointed. It only contained half the secret technique. However, its contents provided significant inspiration.</p><p>The Gu Manual largely discussed cultivating highly toxic insects, but a portion applied to other spirit insects as well.</p><p>This cultivation method was similar to the Gu-raising technique Qin Sang had heard of, with a difference: the Gu Manual didn't just involve making insects devour each other, but also used special medicinal pills to assist.</p><p>The biggest risk of raising Gu was the ferocity of the resulting insects; their intelligence was also affected.</p><p>Following the instructions in the *Gu Jing*, the risks can be minimized, but only with thorough preparation and a methodical approach.  Rushing things is counterproductive.</p><p>Used correctly, it can even guide the insect's evolution in the desired direction.</p><p>Of course, one can ignore the risks and use the Gu-raising technique to quickly select the most ferocious insect, gaining a powerful ally.  That's precisely what the Disciple of the Scarface Man did.</p><p>The Scarface Man's jade beetle likely draws some inspiration from this, but it goes beyond the scope of the first half of the *Gu Jing*.</p><p>Qin Sang, having immersed herself in insect-controlling techniques for many years and inherited the knowledge of both human and Wu tribes, judged the *Gu Jing* method feasible.</p><p>However, only the Fire Jade Centipede is suitable.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm and the Sky Eye Butterfly are too important; Qin Sang cannot risk any mishap.</p><p>Cultivating Gu insects requires consuming similarly attributed spirit insects. Qin Sang couldn't immediately classify the Sky Eye Butterfly.  Misguiding its evolution and losing its ability to control劫雷 (jie lei) would be devastating.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede is simpler. Its treasure-finding ability is based on its keen sensitivity to fiery treasures.</p><p>Gathering spirit insects with fire attributes to feed the Fire Jade Centipede, and using the Gu-raising technique only to help it reach its fourth transformation, the impact should be controllable.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the insect jars on the table. She would first study the *Gu Jing* and experiment with them. If the Fire Jade Centipede remained stubbornly resistant to metamorphosis, she would consider this method.</p><p>Returning to Zhuozhou, Qin Sang immediately sent all the venomous insects to Loutai Pavilion, entrusting them to the Zhou Ruan couple and giving them a large sum of spirit stones, guiding them in insect cultivation.</p><p>The Zhou Ruan couple dared not refuse Qin Sang's order, and naturally, they were delighted to receive such a secret technique.</p><p>Qin Sang then returned to Yan Shui Xu, commissioning Liu Zhou Tang to collect third-stage fire-attribute spirit insects and various herbs for refining auxiliary pills.</p><p>Cultivators skilled in alchemy are numerous in Central State; finding an alchemist is not difficult.</p><p>Afterward, both Qin Sang's original body and her clone focused their energy on cultivation, hoping for the early completion of the secret technique.</p><p>Unknowingly, another twenty years passed.</p><p>Feiyun Ferry.</p><p>Late at night, Feiyun Ferry was brightly lit. Above the lake, a city shone, towering a thousand meters high.</p><p>The magnificent celestial city displayed its grandeur under the night sky.</p><p>The moonlight bathed everything in its glow.  Mist rose from the lake, cloaking the city in an air of mystery – a fitting image for a legendary abode of immortals.</p><p>A jade bridge spanned north, south, east, and west, a complex network of pathways. Night pearls embedded in the bridge shone brightly, mirroring the moon above.</p><p>Built from the finest jade, flawless and intricately woven, the bridge resembled white dragons extending from the shores of Feiyun Ferry to the surrounding peaks, supporting the majestic celestial city.</p><p>Above the jade bridge, towers and pavilions rose in layers, exquisitely carved and shimmering, like stars embedded in the sky, resplendent and awe-inspiring.</p><p>Below, two rivers converged, their rushing waters reflecting another city beneath the surface.</p><p>Countless ships and pleasure boats sailed on the river, seemingly floating in mid-air, entering a fairyland.  Passengers crowded to the decks, gazing at the celestial city above, awestruck and envious.</p><p>Even at night, the celestial city buzzed with activity.  Cultivators, commoners, merchants – all were treated equally, traversing the jade bridge, walking or hiring mounts and carriages at the stations.</p><p>Spirit beasts of various forms, dragons, phoenixes, and qilin were everywhere, though only resembling them in appearance.  True divine bloodlines were impossible.</p><p>Cultivators like auspicious omens.</p><p>The celestial city was divided into twenty-two domains, based on the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. The Heavenly Stem domains were the most prestigious, while commoners mostly lived in the Earthly Branches domains.</p><p>Spirit beasts and carriages raced along the central part of the bridge.</p><p>Zhou Jin, riding a spirit beast called a Dragon Horse, was slowly approaching the Ding domain of the celestial city when he heard a commotion.  Looking down, he saw a ball of flame soaring upwards, a creature resembling a fire phoenix.</p><p>The 'fire phoenix,' disregarding the city's rules, soared over the water.  With a powerful beat of its fiery wings, it ascended, scattering sparks.</p><p>Under countless amazed gazes, the fire phoenix rose and landed before a jade tower in the Ding domain, prostrating itself.  A Daoist descended.</p><p>Someone was already waiting, leading the fire phoenix away, while the Daoist entered the tower.</p><p>"A true man should be like this!" Zhou Jin murmured, filled with envy.</p><p>Such a 'fire phoenix' was one of the most prestigious mounts in the city – truly dazzling.  He could afford to rent one, though he'd have to grit his teeth.</p><p>But the city was teeming with powerful figures; he, a mere Golden Core cultivator, didn't dare to be ostentatious.</p><p>Shortly after arriving in Xiancheng, Zhou Jin encountered several Golden Core cultivators whose cultivation surpassed his, all of them calmly riding spirit beasts.  As for Yuan Ying cultivators, unless they weren't concealing their presence, one wouldn't recognize them even face-to-face.</p><p>"One day, when I reach the level of Senior Qin, I'll enjoy this again," Zhou Jin set a goal for himself. He squeezed his legs, and the intelligent dragon horse understood immediately, rearing its head and letting out a long neigh before galloping forward.</p><p>After a swift ride, Zhou Jin entered the Dingzi area, only then realizing there was more to it than met the eye.  What he had seen from the outside was only half of the area; the other half was hidden by a powerful formation, and was quite serene.</p><p>Zhou Jin, remaining dutiful, rode his horse to a quiet courtyard.  As he stopped, the courtyard door opened from within, and a young man emerged.</p><p>Upon seeing Zhou Jin, the young man showed the delight of seeing an old friend, bowing respectfully: "Xie Liu greets Master Zhou."  This young man was a rising star of the Xie family.</p><p>Five years ago, Jiang Mu was transferred from Yan Shui Xu to Feiyun Ferry by the Liuzhou Hall.  Most of the treasure exchange meetings and auctions were held in Feiyun Ferry. Following Jiang Mu's suggestion, Qin Sang also moved there and rented a cave dwelling in the Jiazi area.  He also had the Xie family establish a base in Feiyun Ferry for his use.</p><p>Handing the dragon horse to Xie Liu, Zhou Jin quickly entered the courtyard and whispered, "Quickly send a message; I have urgent business."</p><p>Xie Liu's expression tightened, but he dared not ask any questions. He hurried into the secret room and activated the formation. He knew the formation could be used to transmit messages, but he didn't know to whom the message was being sent. After completing this, Xie Liu settled Zhou Jin in and then diligently returned to his cultivation.</p><p>Jiazi area cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke and disappeared in a flash.</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared before Zhou Jin, who hastily rose and bowed, "Greetings, Senior Qin."</p><p>"Sit," Qin Sang said, "What urgent matter do you have?"</p><p>Zhou Jin dared not sit. He opened the spirit beast pouch at his waist and took out a jar containing an insect. "Junior cultivator followed your instructions and cultivated this insect using a secret technique.  I could previously control it, but recently, as I was preparing to have it consume more poisonous insects to break through, it suddenly exhibited abnormal behavior.  Forcing it to advance might cause it to lose control. I did not dare to decide on my own..."</p><p>Qin Sang took the jar and opened it, revealing a multicolored poisonous moth. It was the moth with the three combined traits. He had set a plan, ordering the Zhou family couple to continue cultivating it, and now its appearance had been completely transformed.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the moth and carefully sensed it.</p><p>In just twenty years, the moth had advanced from the early stage of its third transformation to the verge of breaking through to the late stage; its speed was undeniably fast, but the cost was also enormous.  This did not even include the massive resources he had provided.</p><p>The moth's temperament had become extremely ferocious; even Qin Sang, a Yuan Ying cultivator, could not completely subdue it.</p><p>This was the consequence of seeking quick results.</p><p>When he had given it to Zhou Jin, Qin Sang had anticipated this. He needed this negative example to judge the severity of the risks.</p><p>"Well done."</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's praise, Zhou Jin's anxiety finally subsided.</p><p>After asking Zhou Jin for pills and two poisonous insects prepared for consumption, Qin Sang entered a quiet room, using a formation to create a sealed area. He placed the three insects together and crushed a pill into powder, sprinkling it inside.  Besides the moth, there was a centipede and a poisonous ant.</p><p>After ingesting the pill powder, the three insects displayed varying degrees of frenzy, with the moth being the most severe. It went completely berserk, its wings flapping violently as it sprayed a cloud of poison towards its opponents.</p><p>The opponents were equally relentless.</p><p>A bloody battle ensued, ultimately resulting in the centipede and ant being defeated, their corpses devoured by the moth.</p><p>Qin Sang watched impassively, occasionally throwing in various pills.</p><p>'Crunch… crunch…'</p><p>A bone-chilling crunching sound echoed in the quiet room.</p><p>After devouring the corpses of its enemies, the moth fell silent for a moment before its aura suddenly surged, breaking through to the late stage of its third transformation. Simultaneously, its temperament became even more violent.</p><p>'Bang bang bang…'</p><p>The moth, trapped in a sphere of light, seemed tireless, frantically ramming against the light barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang rapidly tapped his fingers, imbuing the light sphere with numerous formations to forcefully restrain the moth, finally bringing it to a standstill. After careful examination, Qin Sang obtained the information he sought, gaining a greater grasp of this secret technique.</p><p>The fat silkworm, perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, greedily eyed the moth, already impatient. Upon receiving Qin Sang's approval, it swallowed the moth whole.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the fat silkworm with a doubtful expression.</p><p>This guy directly swallowed the insect whole; what's the difference between that and raising insects? Won't there be problems later?</p><p>This was already the third insect. If it could bring significant improvement to the fat silkworm, he would consider using this method to cultivate its food, otherwise, with such a high consumption, Qin Sang couldn't afford it.</p><p>Returning to the Jiazi area, Qin Sang contacted Jiang Mu to purchase the remaining necessary items and began preparations to help the fire jade centipede transform.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Friends and colleagues are getting sick one after another, it's truly unavoidable. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before I am too.  I'm really overwhelmed and exhausted right now. I'll do my best to update during this period, but I might need to take time off at any time. I just hope things will get back on track soon.</p>
