<h1>Chapter 1738: The True Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix</h1><p>Facing the seal of the Phoenix Clan's ancestral hall, Qin Sang directly summoned six divine birds.  A crimson stream of fire flashed, its dazzling light piercing the water mist. The sky above the spirit island was ablaze with red, the surrounding sea dyed crimson, resembling flowing lava.  The Phoenix King's sudden departure threw the Phoenix Clan into disarray.  They were easily suppressed, flustered and overwhelmed, until they sensed the energy erupting from the ancestral hall, filling them with terror.  The divine birds tore through the air as Qin Sang retreated.</p><p>The moment the flames engulfed the Phoenix Clan's ancestral hall, the entire ancestral grounds, and even the forest where the Phoenix Clan resided, shook violently. Countless demonic birds were startled into flight, a massive, chaotic flock swirling like headless chickens.  Seeing the fire blazing from the forbidden area, they let out terrified cries.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered in mid-air, watching the ancestral hall become a sea of fire. Her eyes narrowed slightly, her expression hinting at surprise. The power of the six birds combined had been tested many times, yet to her astonishment, once the flames subsided, the ancestral hall remained standing, unscathed amidst the raging inferno!</p><p>The ancestral hall creaked and groaned, teetering precariously.  But the seal, formed by the protective barrier, held!  Although the barrier was covered in visible cracks, it hadn't shattered, and a strange energy continuously emanated from the ancestral hall. As this energy flowed in, the cracks in the seal gradually healed.</p><p>The usually invincible Sun Birds had failed to break the seal!</p><p>Qin Sang, with her keen eyes, could tell that this energy originated from the remnant feather. The power resisting the Sun Birds wasn't the ancient hall's prohibition itself, but rather the combined strength of the ancient hall's prohibition and the remnant feather.</p><p>According to the legends of the Yaohai Phoenix Clan, the remnant feather was a true feather of the ancient Heavenly Phoenix, a precious heirloom of the clan.</p><p>Years ago, the various clans of Yaohai had attempted to infiltrate the Canglang Sea to steal the dragon corpse from the Seven Killing Hall.  The Phoenix and Jiao Dragon clans spearheaded this effort. The previous Jiao Dragon King personally risked his life, expending considerable effort and offering substantial rewards to persuade the Phoenix Clan to provide the Heavenly Phoenix feather, entrusted to Jiu Feng Wang, whose bloodline was most compatible with the feather.</p><p>As a true feather of the ancient Heavenly Phoenix, the remnant feather's power was naturally immense. The Phoenix Clan's ancestral hall was where the Heavenly Phoenix feather was enshrined, and its presence was crucial in maintaining the impregnable seal.</p><p>The Yaohai Phoenix Clan claimed descent from the Heavenly Phoenix, yet most of its members couldn't be recognized by the Heavenly Phoenix feather.  Once separated from the ancestral hall, only those with bloodlines most compatible with the Heavenly Phoenix feather could wield a fraction of its power, and even then, its use was severely restricted, making it unsuitable for battlefield use.  Otherwise, the Phoenix Clan could have easily overwhelmed the human race by simply deploying the Heavenly Phoenix feather.</p><p>The Canglang Sea Wu Clan had declined, and the human race had only risen to prominence a few thousand years ago. In terms of accumulated power, they were no match for the Yaohai demonic clans. This is why the Yaohai demonic clans dared to invade the Canglang Sea so brazenly. Even if they suffered defeat, they could simply retreat to their ancestral lands, making it impossible for the human and Wu clans to dislodge them.</p><p>Allowing Jiu Feng Wang to take the Heavenly Phoenix feather to another realm brought about the worry of losing a treasured clan heirloom. In fact, the Jiao Dragon King did perish at the Seven Killing Hall; if the top experts of the human and Wu clans hadn’t desperately sealed the Demon Lord, Jiu Feng Wang and the other demons outside Yitian Peak would have also met their demise.</p><p>However, the Phoenix King had other considerations. At that time, the Yaohai demonic clans harbored suspicions. The Yaohai and Canglang Seas weren’t as distant as imagined; the Yaohai had produced powerful cultivators who knew of the boundary surrounding Yaohai, allowing exit but not entry.</p><p>The connection between the Canglang Sea and Yaohai was established after the discovery of the Seven Killing Hall. The Yaohai demonic clans suspected that the Seven Killing Hall was the key, and that it might not be solely accessible through the Canglang Sea.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King's mission, apart from seeking the dragon corpse, was to use the Heavenly Phoenix feather to explore the secrets of the Seven Killing Hall and search for an exit towards Yaohai. The Jiao Dragon King perished in the battle against the Demon Lord. Afterward, Jiu Feng Wang dared not covet the dragon corpse anymore and went into hiding, secretly exploring the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Before she could find it, the Seven Killing Hall ascended, opening a passage between the two realms, fulfilling her mission in a way.</p><p>While Qin Sang didn't know the full story, she had witnessed Jiu Feng Wang using this feather to break the celestial prohibitions of the inner hall. She had overestimated the feather's power, yet still underestimated it.</p><p>The stronger the seal, the higher the rank of the feather fragment!</p><p>The cracks on the seal were visibly mending, blocking the Nan Ming Li Fire and preventing it from burning the ancient temple.</p><p>Qin Sang silently channeled his cultivation, and more True Qi surged into the Sun God Tree. Six more newly formed divine birds rose and flew into the sea of fire!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Waves of fire surged, engulfing the spirit island in a fiery inferno.</p><p>Amidst the raging flames, almost inaudible cracking sounds could be heard. Qin Sang's expression changed, and his figure vanished instantly.</p><p>Simultaneously, a rift opened in the dark sky, revealing glittering stars within.  The Phoenix King appeared from the rift and charged out.</p><p>She immediately saw the ruined temple and Qin Sang standing amidst the debris, her eyes widening in fury. She let out a mournful roar.</p><p>Qin Sang was examining something in his right hand.</p><p>It was a feather fragment, a little over a foot long, showing signs of breakage. It shimmered with the same light as the sealing barrier, but the light was fading, turning dull yellow, though the beautiful pattern was still visible.</p><p>Even with the dimmed light, Qin Sang dared not touch it directly, enveloping it with his True Qi.</p><p>Fortunately, the feather's power wasn't as violent as the Vermilion Bird feather, requiring no additional treasures to suppress it.</p><p>He looked up and saw the Phoenix King bursting through the formation, surprised.</p><p>While he hadn't focused on the Phoenix King, she was only in the late Transformation stage.  Logically, she shouldn't have broken through the Seven Constellations Sword Formation so quickly.</p><p>Sensing the spiritual energy emanating from the Phoenix King, Qin Sang understood.</p><p>Near the ancestral temple, the Phoenix King could leverage the seal's connection to the Celestial Phoenix feather, gaining power far beyond her cultivation level.</p><p>Now that the temple was destroyed and the Celestial Phoenix feather was in Qin Sang's possession, the Phoenix King's power was drastically weakened.</p><p>"The Yaohai妖族 truly possess a great heritage!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>If he hadn't been cautious and swiftly destroyed the ancestral temple,  if the Phoenix King had successfully used the Celestial Phoenix feather, subduing her would have been extremely difficult.</p><p>In a flash of thought, Qin Sang silently made a sword gesture.</p><p>The dark starry sky behind the Phoenix King dissipated.  In the next instant, his sword spirit clones surrounded her, seven bright sword lights intertwining above her head, ready to strike at his command.</p><p>"I have no intention of causing further bloodshed. I urge you to reconsider, Daoist friend."</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at the Phoenix King, his tone meaningful.</p><p>The Phoenix King stiffened. She sensed the sharpness and power of the sword intent targeting her.  Without the temple's protection, even escaping was difficult, let alone injuring him or reclaiming the Celestial Phoenix feather.</p><p>This was the Phoenix clan's ancestral land.</p><p>With the ancestral temple destroyed, she had no means to counter him.</p><p>If he unleashed a massacre, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>She glared at Qin Sang, her right sleeve trembling slightly, as if concealing some hidden method.  She seemed ready to act several times, then saw the Sun God Tree floating beside Qin Sang, fear flashing in her eyes.  Reason prevailed.</p><p>The Phoenix King clenched her fists, almost biting through her teeth. She forced out a sentence, "I've never seen you before!"</p><p>A cultivator at the Divine Transformation stage couldn't possibly have sprung from a crack in a rock.</p><p>"I am not a cultivator from the Canglang Sea. Of course you wouldn't recognize me," Qin Sang replied casually, his mind still captivated by the Celestial Phoenix feather.</p><p>The Phoenix King's pupils constricted.</p><p>The invisible barrier protecting them, it wasn't a lie.</p><p>The barrier had been gone for only a few hundred years, yet an outsider at the Divine Transformation stage had already arrived. Were the outsiders that powerful?</p><p>"Since Daoist Master comes from the outer realms, we should have no grievances between us.  Are you intending to interfere in the conflict between our two realms, helping the human race slaughter our kind?  Are you not afraid of the repercussions of such bullying?"</p><p>The question seemed so weak. The Phoenix King knew she was bluffing, a chill running through her heart.</p><p>"Who says we have no grievances?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, raising the Celestial Phoenix feather. "Though I am an outsider, this is not my first visit.  Years ago, when my cultivation was weak, your subordinate, Nine Phoenix King, wielded this feather and hunted me down at the Seven Killing Hall. I killed her to retrieve this feather to settle that old score, but I have no intention of causing further trouble."</p><p>The Phoenix King was uncertain. The Nine Phoenix King had reported her experience at the Seven Killing Hall, mentioning chasing a cultivator and nearly being swept away by Yitian Peak.</p><p>But that person was only a Golden Core cultivator back then!</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King was dead; verification was impossible.  Whether it was true or false was meaningless.</p><p>With the Celestial Phoenix feather in his possession, there was no chance he would return it.  That he wasn't launching a massacre in the Phoenix clan's ancestral land was already fortunate.</p><p>But the Phoenix King dared not fully trust Qin Sang's words.</p><p>She controlled her anger, forcing herself to remain calm.  "So, the Daoist won't help the human race slaughter my people, won't interfere in the conflict between the two realms?"</p><p>"Not so," Qin Sang shook his head. "My other purpose in coming here is precisely that, but it's not as straightforward as you might think.  As long as you are cooperative, I will not create further bloodshed.  You alone can hardly make decisions, so I require you to lead the way and take me to the Jiao Long King."</p><p>He paused, looking toward the island's edge.  "Tell your people to stop fighting, or my external manifestation will not be able to hold back any longer."</p><p>The Phoenix King's main body was trapped, but its manifestation and demonic soul were wreaking havoc outside.</p><p>Having been driven into their ancestral lands, the Phoenix clan kings had no retreat and fought to the death, extremely fiercely.</p><p>The Phoenix King's expression shifted, he sighed, emitting a clear cry; the external chaos immediately ceased.</p><p>…</p><p>Western part of the Phoenix ancestral lands.</p><p>On the calm sea surface, a magic boat cut through the waves.</p><p>The manifestation stood at the bow, personally steering the boat; the Phoenix King stood beside him, his face cold as ice.</p><p>As they traveled, Qin Sang could sense nearby demonic creatures spying on them. The deeper they went into the Demon Sea, the more numerous they became, with many Jiao-type creatures further in.</p><p>Qin Sang learned that there were three top-tier tribes in the Demon Sea: the Jiao Long clan, the Phoenix clan, and the Golden Toad clan.  Convincing these three would decide the overall situation.</p><p>He boldly went to the Jiao Long clan, not at all afraid of potential traps.</p><p>The sea surface was boundless.</p><p>They sped forward for an unknown distance.</p><p>Suddenly, waves surged ahead, the sea parting from the front of the boat to either side; the water rose high, like mountains in the sea, with dark figures emerging from the water's depths.</p><p>The newcomers were divided into two groups, one of golden Jiao dragons and one of black Jiao dragons, led by two humanoid, horned demon kings.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body had appeared at the bow at some point, recognizing these as the Jiao Long King's personal guards, but the Jiao Long King himself was absent.</p><p>The two groups of Jiao dragon guards surged from the sea, stopping in front of the boat. The two demon kings bowed from a distance to Qin Sang, then gestured towards each other. Two streams of water met between them, forming a water mirror; a majestic man wearing a golden crown and dragon robes appeared—the Jiao Long King.</p><p>Both sides gazed at each other through the water mirror. The Jiao Long King glanced at the expressionless Phoenix King and bowed.</p><p>"According to human customs, should I address the Daoist as 'True Person' or 'True Monarch'? My belated welcome is a grave oversight!  A grave oversight!"</p><p>His voice boomed like thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly and, without further ado, replied loudly, "Titles are mere formalities, Jiao Long King. Feel free.  My wish, I believe, is already known to you. What are your thoughts?"</p><p>"The True Monarch commands our troops to withdraw with a single word; how can I be sure it's not a delaying tactic?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "If I wished to harm the Demon Sea, why would I need a delaying tactic? If I attacked suddenly on the battlefield, how many of you could escape? Or should I destroy your ancestral halls one by one before you are willing to listen to my mediation?"</p><p>With the last sentence, Qin Sang's tone turned abruptly cold.</p><p>The Jiao Long guards' eyes blazed with anger, but they dared not speak.</p><p>The Jiao Long King remained silent for a long time. "The True Monarch previously sent someone with a message, but it seemed there was more to it."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Jiao dragon guards on either side of the water mirror. "This matter is of great importance and cannot be discussed openly. Does your clan’s water mirror technique allow for private communication?"</p><p>"He's my younger brother, and he's extremely tight-lipped. If the True Monarch conveys the message to him, he will use secret techniques to inform me," the Jiao Long King pointed to the demon king on the right side of the water mirror.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, moving his lips slightly.</p><p>Soon, the demon king's face showed surprise, and without delay, he hurriedly conveyed the message back to the Jiao Long King using secret techniques.</p><p>In the water mirror, the Jiao Long King suddenly stood up.</p><p>He wanted to ask if it was true, but reason told him that this True Monarch, having traveled so far, could not possibly have come to deceive them.</p><p>"I can make a karmic oath," Qin Sang paused, then continued, "This is a calamity that all cultivators in this world cannot escape. I hope to receive your full assistance. Once resolved, you are free to fight as you wish; I will not interfere."</p><p>The Jiao Long King paced back and forth, glancing at the Phoenix King, then said, "I must contact the other clan leaders to discuss this and make a decision."</p><p>"I will wait here for you."</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the magic boat.</p><p>The water mirror dissipated; the Jiao Long guards silently stood in place. Without Qin Sang's command, the Phoenix King did not dare leave the boat.</p><p>The sea surface returned to its calm.</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>On the boat.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, the Celestial Phoenix True Feather on his knees, the Sun God Tree before him.</p><p>On the way, he had learned that the power contained within the Celestial Phoenix True Feather was a type of demonic fire; let's call it Phoenix True Fire!</p><p>Qin Sang activated the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus', aiming it at the Celestial Phoenix True Feather, attempting to extract a strand of the demonic fire using secret techniques and comparing it to the Nan Ming Li Fire within the Sun God Tree.</p><p>"Failure!"</p><p>The fire dimmed, and a sigh escaped.</p><p>But there was no frustration on Qin Sang's face. He could feel that a ripple had occurred within the Celestial Phoenix True Feather when he activated the secret technique; it should at least be easier than refining the Nan Ming Li Fire.</p><p>As he was lost in thought, a voice suddenly rang in Qin Sang's ears, clear as a seven or eight-year-old girl, yet the words were not pleasant.</p><p>"You're going to die."</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed dramatically; his gaze, sharp as a sword, fell upon the Sun God Tree!</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
