<h1>Chapter 2250: Mountain Pavilion</h1><p>The sound dissipated, the jade pendant trembled slightly, and flew towards Qin Sang, embedding itself in his right palm.  </p><p>Perhaps the moment he solved the mystery, the pendant had already acknowledged him as its master.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly moved his thoughts, and the jade talisman reformed, then he stopped worrying about it. It was certainly not a bad thing.</p><p>"Jade Machine Mountain…"</p><p>Qin Sang had been mingling in Yongtu Immortal City for a long time, and was familiar with various factions, especially those of the human race, yet he had never heard of this sect.</p><p>It sounded like Jade Machine Mountain's legacy was the Way of Yin and Yang; he had finally found the orthodox lineage!</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly delighted.  He performed a respectful bow to the spot where the bones were, and then paid his respects to the empty altar, feeling gratitude for the imparted teachings.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't know the name or appearance of this senior cultivator, so Qin Sang could only offer his condolences to the void.</p><p>This senior cultivator had likely been dead for a long time, his bones reduced to ashes.  The longer the time passed, the more remote the hope of collecting the three inheritances became. Without Qin Sang, this jade pendant might have remained buried here forever.</p><p>Apart from this, there were no other objects. He didn't know what happened back then, but the senior cultivator had been alone, leaving behind not even a single magic treasure.</p><p>"From now on, this place shall serve as that senior cultivator's tomb. I will come to pay my respects again when I have the time…"</p><p>Qin Sang thought, walked out of the stone wall, and with a gentle wave of his hand, dispelled the spirit array.  A loud 'boom' echoed as the cave collapsed, completely burying the tomb.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A streak of light soared into the air. Qin Sang flew, sensing the jade pendant.</p><p>The pendant could guide him, but the distance didn't seem short; it would likely take some time to reach Jade Machine Mountain.</p><p>Following the jade pendant's guidance, Qin Sang flew southwest, traveling day and night, traversing countless mountains, rivers, and lakes.</p><p>"I'm now south of Yongtu Immortal City. It seems that Jade Machine Mountain is in the heartland of human forces, so it should at least be unaffected by the recent upheaval…"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced north, secretly guessing what Jade Machine Mountain looked like now.</p><p>If the sect had already been destroyed, he could easily take over, becoming the rightful master of Jade Machine Mountain.  But if the sect still existed, the disciples of Jade Machine Mountain would certainly not easily accept a stranger as their master, inevitably leading to some conflict.</p><p>The situation was unclear.  He would have to adapt to circumstances after arriving at Jade Machine Mountain.</p><p>After flying for several more days, through changes in the jade pendant, Qin Sang judged that he was not far from Jade Machine Mountain.</p><p>Along the way, the landscape became increasingly complex, with barren deserts and lush mountains, generally more vibrant than the area around Yongtu Immortal City.</p><p>Being in the heart of the human territory, there was no shortage of ordinary people living here, mostly humans. Qin Sang was currently flying over a city.</p><p>These ordinary people toiled from sunrise to sunset, living simple lives, unaware of the brutal battles in the distance, unaware that the entire human race was in a precarious situation.</p><p>If they were defeated, the human race might be erased from the Great Thousand World!</p><p>Of course, as someone from the future, Qin Sang knew that the human race was the ultimate victor.</p><p>"Here it is, just ahead!"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, gazing ahead.</p><p>Unlike his imagination, there were no towering peaks, no misty, ethereal marshes. It was the border of a mortal country. Although the mountains were continuous and imposing, they were not insurmountable.</p><p>There were roads built by ordinary people, and human towns and villages scattered everywhere, full of the everyday atmosphere.</p><p>It didn't look like a place for a cultivation sect at all.</p><p>Qin Sang flew forward slowly, soon reaching the top of a mountain peak.</p><p>This mountain was the highest in the vicinity. The nearest town was separated from the mountain by two others.  Perhaps because of the dangerous terrain, there were no villages on the mountain, but there were traces of woodcutters and hunters.</p><p>Appearances can be deceiving, and so can mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the jade pendant, carefully sensing it, and indeed discovered the secret.  He descended and arrived at the east side of Jade Machine Mountain.</p><p>The entire east face of Jade Machine Mountain was a sheer cliff, almost completely vertical, with only hardy pines able to take root there.</p><p>At that moment, a young boy was on the mountainside. He was a herbalist, having climbed from the foot of the mountain using only his hands and feet. He was carefully picking a precious herb from a crevice in the rock, his small face full of excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him, stared at the cliff, then activated the jade pendant, throwing it at the cliff.  The moment it touched the cliff, the pendant emitted a brilliant light, transforming into a strange rune that disappeared in a flash.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed an invisible gate opening for him.</p><p>At that moment, the whole of Jade Machine Mountain trembled slightly.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>The young man, having just gathered herbs, was caught off guard. His grip loosened, his foot slipped, and he tumbled from the cliff.</p><p>He thought he was going to die, but then a strong gust of wind blew him towards a sturdy pine tree.  Using his limbs, he clung to the trunk, his heart pounding.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, someone appeared above, their figure flashing before entering the cliff face.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The moment he passed through the invisible gateway, a wave of alternating hot and cold air washed over him.</p><p>Qin Sang looked closely and saw a narrow, long stone bridge ahead, barely wide enough for one person, stretching into the distance.</p><p>On either side of the bridge were starkly different scenes:  to the right, a sea of raging fire, and to the left, a swirling white mist, with the sound of rushing water below and a biting wind above.</p><p>The fire and mist were boundless, the bridge the only boundary between them.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression hardened. "Am I supposed to cross this bridge?"</p><p>He thought to himself, unsurprisingly, becoming the master of Mount Yuji wasn't easy. The act of entering the mountain gate and controlling the formation itself was clearly a test.</p><p>Standing at the bridge's edge, Qin Sang didn't act rashly. He waited, watching to see if anyone emerged from the other side.</p><p>He had thoroughly searched Mount Yuji and tested its defenses; the mountain remained unresponsive, with no cultivator appearing. It seemed the sect was long gone, leaving behind only a formation.</p><p>Deciding not to hesitate any longer, Qin Sang stepped onto the bridge.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The fire and mist erupted simultaneously. Flames licked at him from the right, while a freezing wind assaulted him from the left.</p><p>Fire and water together—clearly related to the Water-Fire Harmony chapter of his cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately summoned his spirit treasure.  His Water-Fire Chess pieces whirred into action, flying towards the fire and mist.</p><p>After a moment of silence, two currents, one from the fire and one from the wind, surged forth and encircled Qin Sang.</p><p>Protected by the Water-Fire Spiritual Wheel, Qin Sang advanced step by step, feeling the pressure increase with each stride.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Initially focused on resisting the pressure, Qin Sang noticed something unusual after a few steps.</p><p>After a moment's reflection, he sat down on the bridge, closing his eyes.</p><p>The Water-Fire Spiritual Wheel surrounded him, completely blocking the fire and wind.  His aura began to change; he started cultivating right there!</p><p>After several cycles of his cultivation, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, a strange light in their depths.</p><p>This wasn't just a test; it was a training ground for the Water-Fire Harmony chapter, helping him comprehend the Dao more effectively. Cultivating here was incredibly efficient, and the further he went, the better the effect!</p><p>With such a benefit, there seemed no need to rush the formation.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang realized that immediately breaking through was impossible.  Unlike the Three Restrictions of Mount Yuji, this was a massive mountain-protecting formation, with only a portion revealed. Before, it was solving a riddle; now, it was conquering an array.  Forcing his way through would require withstanding a powerful counterattack, something his current cultivation couldn't handle.</p><p>The intention of the one who left this legacy was clear: to allow the successor to improve while navigating the formation.  The array itself acted as a master instructor.  With enough talent, one would naturally grow stronger during the challenge, eventually becoming the master of Mount Yuji.</p><p>Based on the information at hand, Qin Sang estimated that he'd need to break through to the Transcendence stage before reaching the bridge's end—and who knew what awaited him beyond.</p><p>However, the greater the challenge, the stronger Mount Yuji's legacy.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced as he continued, stopping to meditate whenever his Water-Fire Spiritual Wheel showed signs of instability.</p><p>As he practiced his techniques, he sensed a difference.  The formation was his 'enemy' and, simultaneously, a testing ground for his understanding. Many questions were answered in this environment, deepening his comprehension of the Water-Fire Harmony Dao, greatly accelerating his cultivation.</p><p>Several days passed.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke, feeling a marked improvement, silently praising his efforts.</p><p>Suddenly, his joy subsided.  He sighed, "Unfortunately..."</p><p>Unfortunately, he still needed to find someone, uncover the truth behind the illusionary realm, and find a way out—he couldn't remain in one place indefinitely.</p><p>Balancing his time was another test.</p><p>Qin Sang rose, returning to the bridge's starting point.</p><p>For any cultivator practicing the Water-Fire Harmony technique, this place is a sacred training ground. However, the jade pendant only recognizes one master, and Qin Sang cannot yet control the grand formation.  Still, Qin Sang can bring his insights back to his sect, which will greatly benefit Yuan Jing Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang also wants to try other methods to control the Yuji Mountain grand formation. First, he needs to understand Yuji Mountain's origins.</p><p>Even if a sect is destroyed, it's unlikely to completely disappear.  Records might exist in nearby cultivation sects.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang left the cliff face, looked around, chose a random direction, and began a purposeless search.</p><p>…</p><p>A clear spring gurgled, and fragrant flowers filled the air.</p><p>By the spring, several people sat on the ground, unrestrained and carefree.  They sometimes sang loudly, sometimes laughed wildly, with wine jugs, cups, spirit fruits, and immortal peaches scattered everywhere.</p><p>Suddenly, one of them stopped laughing and called out, "Which fellow cultivator is in the heavens?  Why not come down for a drink?"</p><p>"With pleasure!"</p><p>A person slowly descended from the sky – it was Qin Sang.</p><p>"Please!"</p><p>A wine jug, brimming with wine, flew towards Qin Sang on its own.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked them and drank it down in one gulp, immediately eliciting admiration. The gazes upon him softened.</p><p>Having cultivated for many years, Qin Sang had seen all kinds of people and easily integrated into the group, behaving as if they were old friends.</p><p>Through conversation, he learned that these cultivators, having understood the current situation, were pessimistic.  They believed all of humanity might be annihilated; their lives were precarious, and achieving immortality was a mere dream.  What was the point of arduous cultivation?  It was better to forget their worries and live for the moment.</p><p>Qin Sang did not comment on their sentiments, instead subtly eliciting information.</p><p>These cultivators came from several nearby cultivation sects and held relatively high positions, knowing some secrets.</p><p>One even carried a copy of his sect's treasury records, kindly offering it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was interested in history, not sect secrets, so he didn't arouse their suspicion.</p><p>When they asked about his origins, he simply said he was traveling and happened to meet them. No one pursued the matter further.</p><p>That night, the cultivators feasted and parted amicably.</p><p>In a blink of an eye, only Qin Sang remained by the spring, gazing at the scattered mess. He fell into contemplation.</p><p>Several major cultivation forces nearby had members at this gathering, yet none knew of Yuji Mountain, completely unaware of the hidden grand formation near the mountain gate!</p><p>"Could it be that it's been erased by time, due to its age?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the names of these forces in his mind.</p><p>According to these people, the most powerful and longest-established sect was the Yin Yan Manor. Qin Sang planned to find a suitable reason to interact more with the Yin Yan Manor.</p><p>As dawn approached, Qin Sang returned to Yuji Mountain.</p><p>Passing over the town near Yuji Mountain, Qin Sang suddenly thought that he didn't necessarily have to search the cultivation world; clues might exist in the mortal realm.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang unleashed his spiritual sense to scan below.</p><p>This town was built between two mountains.  Due to its advantageous location on the main road to the city and its market for nearby villagers, it gradually prospered.</p><p>On the eastern slope of the town, there were several clearly opulent mansions, commanding a superb view.</p><p>Strangely, the western slope, with even better feng shui, was less populated; most of the houses were dilapidated.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately noticed these inconsistencies but didn't pay much attention, about to probe the houses with his spiritual sense.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang stiffened, his expression turning to one of surprise, as if he had seen something.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang descended from the sky and landed directly in a courtyard on the western slope.</p><p>In the courtyard stood a stone pavilion, situated in the best spot on the entire slope, with an exceptional view, surrounded by mountains.</p><p>Unfortunately, the stone pavilion was overgrown with weeds, vines climbed its pillars, and leaves piled on the roof.  It was almost swallowed by the wild grass, forgotten, exuding the weight of time.</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the pavilion, his fingers trembling slightly.</p><p>Memories flooded his mind, like aged pages, slightly yellowed, but the writing remained clear.</p><p>Once, in an identical pavilion, he had made a promise.</p><p>It was the only time he had made such a promise to a woman.</p><p>That day, just like today, the eastern sky glowed with the golden light of dawn.</p><p>"No matter what, I will not let you down!"</p>
