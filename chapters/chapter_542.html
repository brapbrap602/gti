Chapter 535: The Veil of the Ten Kings Yama Banner


Qin Sang chose to flee westward.
Eastward lay Boundless Valley, from which even seasoned cultivators had been driven out by the beast tide.
Southward was Verdant Sun Market, where hidden experts might lurk.
Qin Sang had no desire to escape Wu Youdao only to be targeted by another, becoming the catch of a different fisherman.
West of the Verdant Sun Demonic Sect stretched a vast territory where spiritual energy was thin.  This area was populated by mortals, with no cultivator sects established there.
At most, some sects dispatched low-level cultivators to manage mundane affairs in the mortal realm.
Wu Youdao pursued Qin Sang relentlessly, their chase traversing countless mountains and rivers, leading them far from the Verdant Sun Demonic Sect.
They clashed several times along the way.
Wu Youdao's natal magic treasure lived up to its reputation.  The Verdant Sun Demonic Fire spewing from the gourd was remarkably refined and far more potent than ordinary Demonic Fire.
Moreover, it shifted forms at will, morphing into blades, spears, swords, and halberds, or expanding into a sea of flames, demonstrating remarkable versatility.
In contrast, the Ebony Sword seemed limited. Qin Sang strained his ingenuity, employing various sword techniques to compensate and barely hold his own against Wu Youdao.
Currently, Qin Sang clutched the Ten Kings Yama Banner, racing against time to refine it.
He believed only this banner could counter Wu Youdao's fiery gourd.
He refrained from using the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman. While it enhanced speed, its boost was finite, and Qin Sang hadn't forgotten Wu Youdao's sudden burst of speed using a secret technique.
Wu Youdao seemed to sense the Ebony Sword's limitations and aimed to gradually wear him down.
Qin Sang knew he couldn't rely solely on the talisman to escape. He needed to display his strength and force Wu Youdao to retreat. Therefore, he reserved the talisman as a last resort and focused on refining the banner.
Qin Sang had possessed the Ten Kings Yama Banner for a long time, using it against several opponents and becoming familiar with its operation.
Previously, he relied on the power of the banner's main spirit, understanding its effects but not its essence.
He knew nothing of the banner's inner workings or the Nine Nether Demonic Fire. Why did a strange flame emerge instead of the myriad souls he expected? What was the connection between the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and the banner?
As the refinement progressed, the banner’s mysteries gradually unveiled themselves.
Qin Sang initially assumed the artifact version of the banner required both deceiving someone into becoming its main spirit and absorbing countless souls to reach its full potential. He imagined the magic treasure version was even more demanding.
It was not only the treasured artifact of the Spectral Yin Sect but also the renowned magic treasure of Patriarch Spectral Yin, once feared throughout the Minor Cold Region.  Legend said that ten banners formed an array capable of rivaling a supreme-grade magic treasure.
Qin Sang expected an immensely evil artifact, teeming with countless devoured souls.
However, as he gained control, he realized his mistake. The banner wasn't the hell he envisioned. It held no wailing souls, only the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.
The fire resembled a slumbering black dragon, coiled within the banner's space.
As the refinement deepened, Qin Sang grew convinced that the banner served as a vessel to contain the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.  The banner itself lacked offensive power, relying entirely on the Demonic Fire for combat.
Yet, Qin Sang felt no disappointment.  He discovered the Demonic Fire he previously wielded was but a fraction of its true power.
The true Nine Nether Demonic Fire was no less formidable than the Verdant Sun Demonic Fire within Wu Youdao's gourd.
Moreover, Qin Sang had a strange feeling that while the Nine Nether Demonic Fire was likely inferior to the Ancestral Sacred Fire on Divine罡 Peak, it possessed unique qualities that might surpass it.
He noticed a connection between the Ancestral Sacred Fire and the Verdant Sun Demonic Fire.  The Ancestral Sacred Fire’s creation, even if not directly man-made, was surely linked to the Verdant Sun Demonic Sect’s ancestors.
Despite his extensive reading, Qin Sang remained clueless about the Nine Nether Demonic Fire's origin.
This peculiar flame couldn't be artificially created.  How Patriarch Spectral Yin subdued it, making it so docile and obedient to the banner's master, remained a mystery.
They flew over a large river.
Ahead, a plain appeared, with a city visible in the distance.
The commotion caused by their flight alerted the mortals below.
Soldiers lined the city walls, gazing in fear at the two streaks of light.
As the saying goes, when immortals fight, mortals suffer.
Finally, Qin Sang completed the banner's refinement.  It floated before his chest, black flames flickering on its surface, poised to erupt.
Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, changed course, and flew towards the wilderness, avoiding the city.
Wu Youdao seized the opportunity.  Green light flashed from his gourd, and a fiery projectile shot forth, transforming into an arm-thick arrow aimed at Qin Sang's back.
This time, Qin Sang wouldn't flee.  His Corpse Pill's true essence was nearing depletion.
He withdrew the Ebony Sword and touched the banner, unleashing a torrent of black flames.
*Boom!*
The two streams of fire collided.
The explosion sent green and black flames swirling, the shockwave shattering a boulder on a nearby mountaintop.
"Nine Nether Demonic Fire?"
Wu Youdao's pupils contracted, instantly recognizing the fire's origin. He demanded, "The Ten Kings Yama Banner?  Are you a Spectral Yin Sect remnant?"
"Look closely, Fellow Daoist Wu. The Spectral Yin Sect's ghosts are gone without a trace. I have no desire to be associated with that cursed sect," Qin Sang cackled.
Inwardly, he sighed. He couldn’t fool Wu Youdao.
As fellow demonic cultivators, they would be well-versed in the Spectral Yin Sect's famed magic treasure.
This battle exposed both the Ebony Sword and the Ten Kings Yama Banner.  While he needn't worry now, he couldn't change his magic treasures or remain in seclusion indefinitely.
Maintaining his disguise would be difficult. The Verdant Sun Demonic Sect would eventually uncover his deeds.
But to escape, Qin Sang disregarded these concerns.
In Wu Youdao's eyes, he was a genuine Core Formation cultivator.
Future discovery wouldn't be disastrous. He’d only stolen some Divine罡 Qi and killed a Foundation Establishment disciple.
Qin Sang knew Wen Yanjie well.
Would they pursue a Core Formation cultivator with Righteous Path sect connections over such a minor grievance?
"Fellow Daoist Wu, I've said it repeatedly.  I needed Dry Sky罡 Qi and had no choice but to infiltrate your sect and steal a small piece of罡 Jade.  I took nothing else and certainly didn’t covet your sect’s forbidden treasures.  Why pursue me so relentlessly?"
Qin Sang shouted as he manipulated the Ten Kings Yama Banner.
