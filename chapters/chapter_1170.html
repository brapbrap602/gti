<h1>Chapter 1162 Portrait</h1><p>Chapter 1162 Portrait</p><p>Sect Leader.</p><p>The words escaped their lips, and both were startled.</p><p>They looked at the portrait hanging on the wall of the main hall.</p><p>The painting showed only a back view. The person stood with hands behind their back, seemingly wielding a sword against an enemy; the sword energy was like a waterfall, the momentum extraordinary.</p><p>On their thumb, a prominent iron ring was clearly visible.</p><p>The person in this portrait was the legendary founder of the Moyan Sect.  Even Mei Gu had never seen the founder's face, so she could only paint a back view from imagination and place it here for worship.</p><p>"I wonder where the Sect Leader is now, and if they are well…"</p><p>Mei Gu's voice was soft and melancholic.</p><p>Zhao Shanran sighed, "The Sect Leader hasn't appeared for so long; I'm afraid they're… Even if they are alive, they've surely forgotten us. Back then, the Sect Leader was merely acting on a whim when they gathered us scattered cultivators to establish this sect. We haven't even seen their face.  One can imagine their attitude towards us."</p><p>"Junior Brother, don't be disrespectful!"</p><p>Mei Gu's brows furrowed, showing no mercy as she scolded angrily, "We were scattered cultivators, living precariously, with slim chances of reaching the Foundation Establishment stage. It was the Sect Leader who passed down cultivation techniques and pills, guiding us to successfully reach Foundation Establishment.  They established the sect here, setting up a top-tier protective array, giving us a place to survive in the cultivation world. Later, during the Abyssal Sin Calamity, it was thanks to the magical artifacts and pills left by the Sect Leader that we were able to kill that Abyssal Sin cultivator and obtain the Chilling Soul Pill. This grace is like a rebirth, have you forgotten all of it?"</p><p>Mei Gu was furious.</p><p>Zhao Shanran was startled and quickly apologized, "Junior Brother misspoke, please forgive me, Senior Sister."</p><p>"Go and apologize to the Sect Leader, don't let it happen again!"</p><p>Seeing Zhao Shanran's apology, Mei Gu waved her hand, "Junior Brother, you may leave now. Make the necessary arrangements quickly. I will send messages to a few friends to help with the situation. As long as you don't leave the mountain gate easily, you don't need to worry too much. Even if Junior Brother Lu forms a Golden Core, his strength won't be too strong. The Yinquan Sect won't dare to directly attack our mountain protection array."</p><p>After watching Zhao Shanran leave, Mei Gu let out a faint sigh.</p><p>Although those words were true,</p><p>the Sect Leader had burdened her with heavy responsibilities, yet acted like a hands-off leader, ignoring the sect.  Mei Gu naturally harbored resentment.</p><p>However, to maintain the sect's morale, she had to take the moral high ground and not allow anyone to openly criticize the Sect Leader.</p><p>Mei Gu closed the main hall and walked towards her cave dwelling.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang quietly appeared in the main hall, admiring his own portrait.</p><p>These four disciples were carefully selected by Jiu Pao Dao Ren among the scattered cultivators, all exceptionally talented. However, Qin Sang didn't expect two of them to successfully form Golden Cores.</p><p>This was his first time hearing of the Chilling Soul Pill; it must be a pill used by Abyssal Sin cultivators to aid in Golden Core formation.</p><p>In times of chaos, some people can actually benefit from misfortune.</p><p>With Qin Sang's discerning eye, he could see the resentment in Mei Gu and Zhao Shanran's hearts, but this was human nature; the key was their fundamental character.</p><p>Since there were no immediate issues, Qin Sang decided to observe further.</p><p>Qin Sang already had a plan.</p><p>He needs to take care of the Demon Realm matters, and is stretched thin.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect's Sect Master has a great reputation and is no easy opponent.  Unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang didn't want to resort to special means to avoid making an enemy of him.</p><p>Absorbing the Ancestral Saint Fire also won't be as easy as last time to conceal it.</p><p>Knowing oneself and one's enemy ensures victory in a hundred battles. First, he must find out the details of the Qingyang Demon Sect before visiting their Sect Master.  With the Moyan Sect's allegiance to the Qingyang Demon Sect, it will be easier for Mei Gu to contact Qingyang Demon Sect cultivators and gather information.</p><p>…</p><p>After receiving the order, the Moyan Sect began to make preparations diligently.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>A piercing sound of air breaking came, and several figures descended in front of the Fire Mountain.</p><p>Leading the way was a crane-haired, child-faced Daoist—the Sect Master of the Yinquan Sect. Beside him stood a cultivator wearing a hooded cloak.</p><p>"This is not my first visit, but every time I see your sect's protective formation, it's so awe-inspiring."</p><p>The Yinquan Sect Master sent a talisman into the array, his eyes filled with intense desire.</p><p>The hooded figure said calmly, "As long as you help me eliminate those two, the Moyan Sect will be under our control, and I will fulfill my promise."</p><p>As he spoke, the mist surged, revealing a path leading to the mountaintop, and Mei Gu's voice echoed from afar, "Sect Master Dong, you honor us with your visit. My apologies for not being able to greet you personally."</p><p>"It was I who was presumptuous!"</p><p>The Yinquan Sect Master replied loudly.</p><p>Then he lowered his voice, "Daoist Lu, Elder Wu, follow me; the others wait outside."</p><p>The hooded person and another burly man followed the Yinquan Sect Master into the Moyan Sect.</p><p>At the mountain top...</p><p>Madam Mei personally led her disciples in welcoming the guests.</p><p>"Master Dong, Master Wu…"</p><p>Madam Mei stepped forward, greeting each one in turn.  Her gaze then shifted to the cloaked figure, and she asked with a smile, "I wonder who this Daoist friend is?"</p><p>"He is an old friend of mine, Master Dong.  He also has a significant connection to your sect…"</p><p>Master Dong's words trailed off.</p><p>The cloaked figure, without a word, walked towards the main hall.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p>Zhao Shanran and the other disciples of the Moyan Sect were furious, drawing their swords to block the cloaked figure.</p><p>Madam Mei's face turned cold. She said icily, "This old friend of Master Dong's seems to lack manners! Or does he think that the three of you Golden Core cultivators can act as you please within our formation?"</p><p>Master Dong smiled in response.</p><p>The cloaked figure snorted coldly and abruptly removed his cloak.</p><p>Seeing the cloaked figure's face, the Moyan Sect disciples gasped.</p><p>"Lu, I am here to pay respects to my master, and you dare stop me?"</p><p>Lu Xing roared suddenly, his Golden Core cultivator's aura evident.</p><p>The Moyan Sect disciples' faces changed drastically, forced back by Lu Xing.</p><p>Zhao Shanran, harboring deep hatred, angrily cursed, "It's you, you heartless wretch! You were motivated by greed, murdered your fellow disciples, and still have the nerve to return!"</p><p>"A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator dares to bark in my presence?"</p><p>Lu Xing sneered, "What proof do you have? I say it was you who, for the sake of the Zanpo Dan, cruelly murdered Brother Hongye and then framed me. Luckily, I was vigilant enough to escape your clutches."</p><p>Master Dong, seizing the opportune moment, stepped forward to mediate, "The rights and wrongs of the past are difficult to unravel; only those involved know the truth.  To be fellow disciples and yet turn on each other… I feel sorry for the Moyan Sect.  Fortunately, Daoist Friend Lu never forgot the sect's nurturing grace, and recently went to the Qingyang Demon Sect to plead for the Moyan Sect, securing a reduction in the number of those to be punished by half. This shows Daoist Friend Lu's sincerity. I believe this alone should allow Daoist Friend Lu to pay his respects to his master."</p><p>Lu Xing's anger turned to a smile. He said amicably, "I've watched all of you grow up. How could I bear to let you go to your deaths?"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhao Shanran's face changed drastically.</p><p>Master Dong and Lu Xing muddied the past events with a few words, then displayed their feigned benevolence, their malice unmistakable.</p><p>Madam Mei remained calm. She was about to speak,</p><p>when the main hall suddenly opened on its own, and a faint voice came from within.</p><p>"I don't recall ever taking you as a disciple."</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Making up for yesterday and the day before. More to come, it might be a bit late.</p>
