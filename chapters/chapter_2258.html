<h1>Chapter 2248  A Bloody Path</h1><p>The "Yin-Yang Correspondence Treatise" and the "Four Seasons Harmony Treatise" were likely created by human cultivators. However, the "Four Seasons Harmony Treatise" posits that the Yin-Yang Dao is the fundamental principle of the world, encompassing all living beings.  This technique emphasizes "harmony" rather than cultivation, making it accessible to both humans and demons.  Therefore, Clan Chief Jin Xiao's achievement is not surprising.</p><p>However, the "Four Seasons Harmony Treatise" has a drawback.  The jade tablet is incomplete, with significant missing sections. Clan Chief Jin Xiao spent years trying to fill in the gaps, but limited by his cultivation and understanding, his version is inferior to the original. This led to problems during cultivation.</p><p>The most serious incident occurred during a breakthrough. He achieved a breakthrough easily, but before his cultivation could stabilize, a hidden danger suddenly erupted, almost causing his foundation to collapse.  Cultivation setbacks are minor; the worst-case scenario is a cultivator's body exploding, resulting in death.</p><p>Clan Chief Jin Xiao reacted quickly, narrowly escaping. However, the subsequent healing cost him dearly.  Despite understanding the technique's profound nature, he dared not cultivate it further, nor did he pass it on to his confidants.</p><p>Thereafter, Clan Chief Jin Xiao searched for the missing part of the jade tablet and investigated the origins of the "Four Seasons Harmony Treatise," but to no avail.  He theorized that human cultivators created it, so he volunteered for the front lines to search for the sect possessing this heritage.  Unexpectedly, he found no clues among humans.  Instead, after meeting some Golden Eagle cultivators, he discovered the cave's location.</p><p>Following this, Clan Chief Jin Xiao frequently contacted Golden Eagle cultivators who had previously explored the cave, buying the treasures they brought out, hoping to obtain the other half of the "Four Seasons Harmony Treatise."  He offered high prices, and most Golden Eagle cultivators were willing to trade.  However, several refused, and these cultivators held high positions and had powerful backing, making direct action difficult. He also discovered that human cultivators initially found the cave, and some treasures fell into the hands of individuals like the Transcendent Divine Cultivator.</p><p>So, he simultaneously persuaded the Golden Eagle cultivators and plotted to seize the treasures from the Transcendent Divine Cultivator and others.  However, before his plan was complete, he was defeated by Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved a jade slip from a storage device. It contained the portion Clan Chief Jin Xiao had deduced himself.  First, Qin Sang's true cultivation far surpassed Jin Xiao's. Second, Qin Sang's understanding of the Yin-Yang Dao was incomparable to Jin Xiao's. He immediately identified several issues.  However, even for Qin Sang, restoring the technique to its original perfection would be extremely difficult.</p><p>Despite being just a fragment, this is a significant lead.  It remains unknown if the "Four Seasons Harmony Treatise," like the "Water-Fire Harmony Chapter," is part of the "Yin-Yang Correspondence Treatise." If they are of equal standing, it's hard to imagine the scale of the complete text!</p><p>Even with just the "Water-Fire Harmony Chapter" and most of the "Four Seasons Harmony Treatise," Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel at its profoundness.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang retrieved the treasures Jin Xiao had bought from the Golden Eagle cultivators and examined each one.  The spoils of war from his battle with the Golden Eagles, which the Transcendent Divine Cultivator had returned before his seclusion, were also among them. Qin Sang tried piecing them together, but unfortunately, without much success.</p><p>Looking at the pile of treasures, Qin Sang fell into contemplation.  He had two options:</p><p>One, seek out the remaining Golden Eagle cultivators and recover all treasures from the cave; this might yield new findings.</p><p>Two, revisit the place where Jin Xiao obtained the "Four Seasons Harmony Treatise"; there might be something Jin Xiao missed.  However, Jin Xiao had already returned many times, searching thoroughly, making this option unlikely.</p><p>“It seems I need to visit Lingkong Mountain…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought, glancing towards the Poison Swamp.  The sounds of many people indicated that Jin Xiao's fellow demons had discovered something amiss and were approaching.</p><p>Jin Xiao only confided in a few confidants, all of whom Qin Sang had eliminated in the Poison Swamp.  No one knew the killer's identity, eliminating the need to eliminate remaining threats.</p><p>Qin Sang collected the items and departed.</p><p>…</p><p>Near a demon army camp.</p><p>Two streaks of light, swift as arrows, darted through the clouds toward the camp. These were two Golden Eagle cultivators returning from a mission.</p><p>Suddenly, one light stopped, revealing a majestic golden eagle.</p><p>Its companion also halted.  “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Nothing! I sensed the aura of an old friend nearby…”</p><p>It shook its head, its eyes gleaming. It took out a pouch and handed it to its companion. “Take these back to report.  I haven’t seen this old friend in years.  This is a fortuitous reunion; let's catch up.”</p><p>"Aren't you afraid I'll keep the reward for myself?"</p><p>His companion joked, asking no further questions, took the pouch, and vanished.</p><p>Watching his companion leave, the Golden Eagle cultivator descended rapidly towards a nearby peak.  He saw a strange person with Azure Bird wings, his eyes flashing with alertness. "Who are you?"</p><p>"The message you received earlier was sent by me," Qin Sang bowed and explained, "I am close friends with Clan Chief Jin Xiao.  We are stationed in the same camp, and I happened to be passing by on a mission.  Clan Chief Jin Xiao asked me to visit you."</p><p>The Golden Eagle cultivator's expression softened slightly, but his vigilance remained. "If he sent you, is everything complete?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>Qin Sang produced a wooden box. "The Earth Scale Stone, Phoenix Immortal Paste, and the Qiong Hua Jade Crystal are all inside. Please examine them."</p><p>These were the terms he had negotiated with Jin Xiao.</p><p>Seeing that everything matched, the Golden Eagle cultivator's apprehension lessened. He reached for the box, but Qin Sang suddenly withdrew it.</p><p>"Have you forgotten something, friend?"</p><p>The Golden Eagle cultivator chuckled awkwardly and produced several items from a storage pouch.  "The treasures are all here. Please examine them."</p><p>Both then checked each other's items. The Golden Eagle cultivator took the box and opened a small crack. A blinding light burst forth, causing him excruciating pain in his eyes.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>He only managed a scream before being engulfed by the light.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang erased all traces of the encounter and left.</p><p>After a while, his companion, waiting in vain, sensed something was amiss and came to investigate.  But he found nothing unusual, circled the area, and returned empty-handed.</p><p>Jin Xiao, fearing the Golden Eagle clan's power, hesitated to kill directly. He sought to trade with them, as discovery would be disastrous.</p><p>Qin Sang had no such reservations; killing the cultivator and taking the treasures was the quickest method.</p><p>Back then, most of the Golden Eagle cultivators involved in the division of spoils were at the Transformation stage. Qin Sang easily dealt with them.  Only one later achieved a breakthrough, reaching Jin Xiao's level, requiring more effort.</p><p>…</p><p>West foot of Ling Kong Mountain.</p><p>This area was more barren than other parts of the mountain range. A rare cultivation site was divided among several powerful Golden Eagle cultivators.</p><p>Years ago, one of them made a significant breakthrough, subduing all the other cultivators and becoming the sole ruler of the area. This Golden Eagle cultivator's cave was located in a large lake, on an island shrouded in mist, with lush vegetation, like a paradise.</p><p>He was an oddity within his clan. He liked to transform into human form, his consorts included several human female cultivators, and even his maidservants were carefully chosen human girls.</p><p>The layout of his cultivation grounds resembled human dwellings, with houses, pavilions, and towers. Humans were frequently seen, while fellow Golden Eagles were rare.</p><p>"Husband, a secret message has arrived."</p><p>A beautiful female cultivator flew to the mountaintop.</p><p>A tall tower reached towards the heavens, built at the summit. From there, one could almost reach the stars.</p><p>The cultivator, not daring to trespass, activated a defensive mechanism, holding the message respectfully at the foot of the tower.</p><p>Moments later, a golden light descended from the sky. The female cultivator felt her hand lighten as the message was taken.</p><p>"Humph! Him again!"</p><p>A young man appeared before the female cultivator.</p><p>His appearance was strikingly handsome, with almost no visible Golden Eagle features.</p><p>Seeing him, the female cultivator's eyes showed adoration. "Husband, who are you talking about?"</p><p>"Who else but Jin Xiao!  Years ago, Brother Wu and I explored a cave and only received a small share, long since forgotten. Recently, Jin Xiao contacted me through Brother Wu, repeatedly trying to buy something, but I refused.  Now, he's come himself!"</p><p>The man crushed the message and narrowed his eyes towards the island's edge.</p><p>"He's so persistent. Could there be a treasure? Husband, don't give it to him," the female cultivator said anxiously.</p><p>The man chuckled. "If you can think of that, how could I not?  But I've checked many times. Nothing worthy of being called a treasure."</p><p>The female cultivator looked puzzled.  "Then why is he so persistent?"</p><p>"Probably related to the cave's inheritance. Brother Wu said the inheritance, left by a human cultivator, seems interesting. Unfortunately, we didn't get the key item.  He might have discovered something.  I'm curious. Let's wait and see, I will meet him again!"</p><p>With a sly smile, the man embraced the female cultivator and entered the tower.</p><p>On another island.</p><p>Qin Sang casually created a stone pavilion and waited. The other party didn't respond, but he wasn't worried.</p><p>As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting golden ripples on the lake, a figure finally appeared in the sky, landing before the pavilion.  He laughed heartily, "I was in seclusion.  I only just saw your message.  I apologize for keeping Clan Chief Jinxiao waiting!"</p><p>"My apologies for disturbing your cultivation," Qin Sang gestured invitingly, "Please, have a seat."</p><p>The man nodded, checking his surroundings before entering the pavilion.  He scrutinized Qin Sang, his brow furrowing slightly. "You are truly Clan Chief Jinxiao?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Qin Sang uttered the two words softly.</p><p>"Who are you, scoundrel?!"</p><p>The man's face turned pale, instinctively trying to retreat.</p><p>"Too late!"</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved, sitting as still as a statue.</p><p>Suddenly, the stone pavilion crumbled, the surrounding light fading.  The man realized he was inside a palace, the enemy vanished.</p><p>This was a spirit array Qin Sang meticulously crafted for Master Chen of the Tianjing Sect, used against Jinxiao and this demon cultivator.  With Qin Sang's abilities, and taking them by surprise, the two demons stood no chance.  The man's attacks were deflected one by one, unable to break the array, finally succumbing within, dying a bitter death.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bother capturing this demon alive.  This was his final target after a long campaign; he had all the information he needed.</p><p>After killing the demon, Qin Sang didn't leave immediately. He wandered near the man's cultivation grounds, spreading his spiritual sense to scan the nearby human inhabitants.</p><p>The humans living among the Golden Eagle tribe were clustered in three main areas. The largest was around the Yuanjing Mountain sect gate. This demon cultivator, fond of humans, kept some as captives in his territory.</p><p>Before arriving, Qin Sang had painstakingly surveyed all these areas. He wondered if, since he was here, Liuli and the others might also be nearby.  He hadn't dared return before due to his weaker power, but now he had to search thoroughly.</p><p>Years ago, he had contacted all the female cultivators who had left this place for Yongtu Immortal City, but found no trace of someone resembling Liuli.</p><p>Considering his initial situation, Liuli might not have found immortal cultivation here, perhaps still being a mortal.</p><p>Qin Sang searched everywhere, finding nothing.</p><p>He turned the ring on his finger, beginning to doubt his earlier assumptions.  Was he the only one who had brought things from the real world? Otherwise, why had he not encountered a single familiar person or object in Yongtu Immortal City all this time?</p><p>His power had largely recovered, yet he still didn't know how to proceed.</p><p>"Could it be in the heavens?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the strange call.</p><p>Leaving the Great Swamp, Qin Sang randomly chose an unnamed mountain peak.  His efforts paid off; he collected all the treasures that had been scattered from the cave back then.</p><p>Qin Sang formed his fingers into a sword, leveling the mountaintop. He laid out the treasures, a dazzling array.</p><p>Based on others' descriptions, he imagined the cave's layout, "repositioning" the treasures, focusing on the items near the "Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang."</p><p>After a thorough investigation, he found little.</p><p>Qin Sang was not discouraged.  He examined his carefully selected treasures, then sifted through them again, leaving only three.</p><p>Finally, his gaze fell upon one – a double-eared porcelain vase. The landscape painted on it was ordinary, its power as a magical artifact was also unremarkable.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang felt something odd about the vase. This feeling was inexplicable, a gut feeling.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the vase.  Suddenly, an idea struck him, and he summoned the Stone Embryo Fire within him.</p><p>The flame touched the vase and was instantly absorbed, then wisps of white smoke emerged from the mouth of the vase, neither dissipating nor dispersing, as if about to form a pattern.</p><p>"So that's it!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy.</p><p>That senior cultivator hadn't taken the Stone Embryo Fire, but a wisp of its essence, refining it into the vase as a 'key.' Only someone who had subdued the Stone Embryo Fire could trigger this change.</p>
