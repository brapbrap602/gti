<h1>Chapter 519 Ancestral Holy Fire</h1><p>After crying, Shi Ying wiped her tears. Just as she was about to put the corpse puppet back into the coffin, she suddenly realized something.  She opened the man's storage pouch and poured out its contents.</p><p>She found many strange items inside, unsure of their purpose. Time was short, so she put everything into her own storage pouch, destroyed the man's pouch, and found a hidden spot to bury Qin Sang and the coffin.</p><p>Shi Ying channeled her spiritual energy to reduce the swelling around her eyes and rushed to the Azure Sun Market. After acquiring a new black coffin, she quickly returned to the burial site.</p><p>Seeing the corpse puppet still obediently staying where she left it, Shi Ying breathed a sigh of relief.  She moved the puppet to the new coffin and carried it on her back. She had seen fellow disciples openly carrying corpse puppets within the sect, and the elders didn't seem to mind.</p><p>…</p><p>In front of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect’s gates.</p><p>Whether disciples or honored guests, no one was permitted to fly here. All had to ascend and descend on foot as a sign of respect.</p><p>Shi Ying stepped onto the white jade stairs, pressed her hand against her chest to calm her racing heart, and quickly made her way up the mountain.</p><p>She encountered fellow disciples along the way, some going up, others down. Those who recognized her were surprised to see her carrying a black coffin, a stark departure from her usual appearance. However, no one dared to question her.</p><p>Soon, the Azure Sun Demonic Sect’s gate was in sight.</p><p>A stone tablet stood at the mountain peak, inscribed with the words "Azure Sun."</p><p>Two groups of young disciples stood guard on either side, their eyes sharp and vigilant.</p><p>Seeing Shi Ying approaching, their eyes brightened and their posture straightened.  As she drew closer, one of the young men mustered his courage and called out,</p><p>"Senior Sister Shi Ying, you've returned from your training?"</p><p>Shi Ying turned her head and smiled at him before continuing on her way.</p><p>"Senior Sister Shi Ying smiled at me…"</p><p>The young man stared dreamily after her retreating figure until his captain kicked him sharply.</p><p>Shi Ying paid no attention to the young disciples. Her heart was pounding with anxiety, though her expression remained calm.  Just as she was about to enter the gate, she suddenly heard a familiar voice.</p><p>"Shi Ying?"</p><p>Shi Ying stopped abruptly and turned to see an elderly man in a green robe standing behind her, frowning.</p><p>Shi Ying recognized him as Elder Yun Yi, a member of her sect. After reaching Foundation Establishment, he had suffered a great calamity, sustaining severe injuries that drastically reduced his cultivation. He could no longer advance and his path to immortality was cut off, so he now served the sect in other capacities.</p><p>Since Shi Ying had joined the sect as a child, Yun Yi had helped her several times. Though his ability to assist was limited, Shi Ying was deeply grateful.</p><p>"Shi Ying greets Uncle Yun," she bowed respectfully, her posture slightly awkward due to the coffin on her back.</p><p>Yun Yi's frown deepened. "Why have you bought a corpse puppet? Are you also planning to abandon the path of immortality and rely on external forces, like your fellow disciples?" he asked sternly.</p><p>"Disciple…"</p><p>Shi Ying stammered, finally coming up with an excuse.  "In reply to Uncle Yun, this disciple plans to train alone in the Boundless Valley soon, so I acquired a corpse puppet for protection.  I do not intend to follow the path of corpse refinement."</p><p>Lying to an elder who had cared for her filled Shi Ying with guilt, but for the sake of revenge, she couldn't afford to hesitate.</p><p>Yun Yi's expression softened slightly.  "That's good! If you are going to the Boundless Valley alone, be careful and don't venture too deep. Also, you have already reached the twelfth level of Qi Refinement, so you should focus on achieving Foundation Establishment. Do not be tempted by demonic or unorthodox practices, or you will regret it!  You may go…"</p><p>"Yes, this disciple understands."</p><p>Shi Ying bowed again and left with her head lowered.</p><p>Unbeknownst to her, someone was even more anxious than she was.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his cultivation, so Yun Yi naturally couldn't sense him. However, he was unsure of the intricacies of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect’s protective formation and whether it had any detection capabilities.  He wondered if the fact that he had been refined into a living corpse, combined with Shi Ying’s soul mark within him, connecting their auras, would be enough to conceal his presence.</p><p>Behind the 'Azure Sun' tablet was a square stone platform. Clouds and mist swirled below. Leaping from this platform meant truly entering the Azure Sun Demonic Sect.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Shi Ying summoned her flying artifact and flew off the platform, into the sea of clouds.</p><p>Quickly, she passed through the clouds.</p><p>Green mountains and clear waters, pavilions and towers, waterfalls and springs, red suns and flying cranes - the ubiquitous scenery of the immortal realm unfolded before Shi Ying's eyes.</p><p>She was already familiar with all of this.  Her gaze swept across the landscape, settling on a distant mountain silhouette. She flew straight towards it.</p><p>As the former grounds of a Nascent Soul cultivator, the Azure Sun Demonic Sect occupied a vast area.  Mountains and rivers intertwined, forming a magnificent landscape that rivaled Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Shi Ying flew with her head down, passing over several mountains before finally arriving at the inner sect. The security here was much tighter, with many patrolling disciples who stopped her.  She showed her identification token and was allowed to pass.</p><p>No one questioned her about the corpse puppet.</p><p>With no issues along the way, Qin Sang's tense nerves finally relaxed. His disguise had worked; he had infiltrated the Azure Sun Demonic Sect!</p><p>The inner sect lay at the heart of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect, comprised of dozens of peaks of varying sizes and shapes where disciples cultivated.</p><p>These peaks surrounded a towering mountain that reached ten thousand feet.</p><p>Compared to this peak, the eight mountains of the outer sect seemed dwarfed. Even while flying, Shi Ying could only look up in awe.  The peak pierced the heavens, its summit shrouded in swirling clouds and rumbling thunder.</p><p>Flashes of lightning and booming thunder shook the sky.</p><p>This was the legendary Divine罡 Peak!</p><p>Strangely, amidst the wind, clouds, and lightning at the peak, there was a rich, green hue.  Even the lightning was tinged with the same color. Looking closely, one could see a gigantic, shadowy figure flickering deep within the clouds at the mountain's summit, radiating an incredibly violent aura.</p><p>It was as if a fire god was dancing in the sky!</p><p>"Ancestral Holy Fire…"</p><p>Shi Ying’s face filled with reverence as she looked at the fiery apparition. Such terrifying power was something she could only dream of!</p><p>Below the swirling clouds and lightning, most of Divine罡 Peak was enveloped in a layer of green mist, like a piece of jade draped over the mountain.</p><p>Lightning danced wildly, striking the green mist, but only caused ripples to appear on its surface.</p><p>Shi Ying shifted her gaze towards a steep mountain next to Divine罡 Peak and urged her flying artifact forward.</p><p>The peaks surrounding Divine罡 Peak were ranked according to the quality of their spiritual veins.  The peaks to the east of Divine罡 Peak had the best spiritual veins, and the sect’s forbidden grounds were also located there.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment elders naturally occupied the best caves.</p><p>Shi Ying had been a disciple for many years and was among the top Qi Refinement cultivators, so her cave was located on a mountain near Divine罡 Peak, with relatively rich spiritual energy.</p><p>The side of this mountain facing Divine罡 Peak was a sheer cliff face, as if sliced clean from top to bottom.</p><p>A narrow, man-made stone path carved into the cliff face connected various caves, with a rough stone railing along its edge.</p>
