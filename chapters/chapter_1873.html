Chapter 1864: Hidden Secrets


The Divine Seal descended.

The three ancient seal script characters remaining on the seal’s surface radiated a cyan light.  In Lingyou Wang's eyes, these characters spun rapidly, like three bottomless whirlpools, threatening to suck his very soul into their depths.

Lingyou Wang was horrified.  Simultaneously, he sensed a threat approaching from behind; the Five Elements Sealing Divine Light was tearing through the air.

Drawing upon the water elemental power from beyond this realm required him to rely on the Swallowing Seas Clam to maintain the divine ability, and he had no time to recall it.

He was attacked from both front and back, and neither the Divine Seal nor the Divine Light was trivial.

Relatively speaking, Lingyou Wang feared the Arctic Ghost Slaying Seal the most. This seal, during the ancient Daoist sects’ heyday, possessed terrifying power, slaying countless monstrous beings and making all evil tremble at its mere mention. He dared not gamble on how much power the seal still retained.

While the Five Elements Sealing Divine Light demonstrated considerable power during his fight with Qin Sang, it was ultimately limited.

Lingyou Wang gritted his teeth, spitting out a mouthful of vital essence blood. Wrapped within the blood was a scale.

This scale was similar in size and shape to the ones he had used before, but this one was blood-red. Whether it was stained by the blood or its natural color was unknown.

A strange light flickered on the surface of the scale, devouring all the vital essence blood.

The scale turned crimson and rapidly expanded, instantly transforming into a massive blood-red shield.

Still uneasy, Lingyou Wang swayed, spitting out a cinnabar-yellow talisman. The talisman turned into a streak of ethereal light and shot towards the shield. An even richer blood-red aura erupted, dyeing half the sky wall in scarlet.

The shield, tall as a mountain, protected Lingyou Wang beneath its shadow.

At the same time, a rustling sound echoed from Lingyou Wang's body. Scales burst open, and a stream of water, conjured by his divine ability, materialized around him, filling the gaps between the scales.

The white rope, a spiritual treasure, wrapped around Lingyou Wang's body several times, nimbly weaving between the scales, stringing them together like a needle and thread.

Lingyou Wang had donned a unique set of scale armor, both flexible and rigid.

In an instant, the Arctic Ghost Slaying Seal and the Five Elements Sealing Divine Light arrived simultaneously!

‘Boom!’

The blood-red scale shield trembled violently.

Compared to the massive shield, the small Arctic Ghost Slaying Seal resembled an insignificant ant on a mountain.  Yet, when this ‘ant’ collided with the ‘mountain,’ it immediately caused the mountain to shake, almost crumbling.

Cyan light spread across the shield's surface, abruptly suppressing the blood-red aura. Accompanied by cracking sounds, a conspicuous dent appeared where the Arctic Ghost Slaying Seal struck, and cracks spread like a spiderweb around the impact point.

Seeing the cracks, Lingyou Wang was even more terrified, but he had no time to dwell on it, as the Five Elements Sealing Divine Light had arrived.

‘Whoosh!’

The Divine Light was incredibly swift, leaving no room for evasion.

Lingyou Wang poured all his power into the scale armor.  At the instant the Divine Light struck, he suddenly realized something was amiss.  Stunned, he had no time to react before his surprised expression froze on his face.

The Divine Light didn't possess the destructive power he had anticipated.

The Five Elements Sealing Divine Light had two aspects: Sealing and Destruction. Outsiders, unaware of its subtle workings, couldn't distinguish between them and were easily caught off guard.

At this moment, Qin Sang unleashed the Sealing aspect of the Five Elements Sealing Divine Light, specifically for confinement.  It was this very power that had allowed Mo Xingdao and the others to repeatedly escape perilous situations within the chaotic Return Void.

Caught unaware, Lingyou Wang found the five-colored Divine Light striking his scale armor without causing any damage. Instead, it burst open like fireworks.

Five-colored light flowed over Lingyou Wang's body.

He looked as if he were wearing a five-colored suit of armor, or perhaps trapped within a five-colored prison. His body became rigid, unable to move.  His expression and gaze remained lifelike, frozen in a single moment.

Within the jungle.

All the Golden Armored Warriors were now surrounding Zuo Zhenren’s altar, their golden chains connected, forming a different kind of formation.

Zuo Zhenren closed his eyes, pacing in a ritualistic pattern, casting spell after spell. Finally, he stomped his foot.  The altar trembled, and the Golden Armored Warriors roared to the heavens. Zuo Zhenren also let out a soft shout, suddenly opening his eyes. His gaze was sharp as lightning, piercing the sky.

In the next moment, all color drained from Zuo Zhenren's face, leaving him pale. His legs seemed unsteady, as if he had exhausted all his strength.

The surrounding Golden Armored Warriors shifted their formation, becoming even more complex and tightly knit.

A thunderous boom echoed from the sky.

High above, the power of the Arctic Ghost Slaying Seal surged. Several large cracks split the blood-red scale shield, and with a deafening roar, the entire shield shattered, utterly destroyed.

Fragments flew in all directions, no longer able to hinder the Arctic Ghost Slaying Seal.

The Divine Seal plummeted.

Only then did Lingyou Wang finally break free from the confining power, shaking off the five-colored Divine Light. He opened his eyes to see the Divine Seal inches away, along with the three spinning seal characters.  Deep fear filled his eyes.

At the same time, a sword’s cry resounded like thunder behind Lingyou Wang.  The Cloud Wanderer Sword, only slightly slower than the Five Elements Sealing Divine Light, arrived.

The Heaven-Splitting Sword Strike was like a dazzling rainbow!

Cyan light from the Divine Seal engulfed Lingyou Wang.

Lingyou Wang let out a desperate roar.  His scale armor rattled, unleashing its final power, but it was instantly suppressed by the cyan light.

‘Crack!’

The sound was like a thunderbolt.

The scale armor shattered.

At that precise moment, the Cloud Wanderer Sword erupted with a shocking sword intent.  Its light, like a wandering dragon, pierced into the cyan light.

Countless scales scattered, like a celestial maiden scattering flowers.

Each ink-black scale was tinged with blood at its base. Some were reduced to dust before they could escape the cyan light.

‘Swish!’

The Cloud Wanderer Sword pierced through the cyan light, its tip trailing a spray of blood. It circled in the air before shooting downwards.

A hole appeared in the sky wall.  The Divine Seal, suppressing a giant fish demon, had punched through the wall and was hurtling towards the earth.

Cyan light rained down from the sky. Within the light, the black fish’s body was rigid, its eyes filled with disbelief.  Its skull was caved in, the Divine Seal embedded in its forehead. A bloody wound, piercing its chest and abdomen, almost cleaved it in two.

Demon blood rained down from the sky!

“Dead?”

Qin Sang stood on the ground, gazing up at the cyan light. He had actually slain a Demon King!

The fatal blow was a combined effort of the Cloud Wanderer Sword and the Divine Seal.  Of course, Zuo Zhenren deserved the most credit.

That Divine Seal, its origins were unknown…

Qin Sang glanced at Zuo Zhenren.  He had already withdrawn his altar and stood among the Golden Armored Warriors. Sensing Qin Sang's gaze, he turned and gave a slight nod.

Qin Sang could sense that Zuo Zhenren was in a weakened state. The seal must be a Daoist treasure, and Zuo Zhenren's words were true. The cost of activating the seal was indeed enormous, though he wondered if there was any element of pretense.

‘Whoosh!’

The cyan light plummeted towards the earth.

Qin Sang was astonished to find that the blood flowing from the fish demon's wound was being absorbed by the Divine Seal upon contact.

The seal was still not satisfied. Under the cyan light, starting from the fish demon’s head, flesh and bone melted away, transforming into pure essence that the Divine Seal devoured.

Qin Sang couldn’t help but look at Zuo Zhenren, who offered an explanation: "The Divine Seal is also a malevolent seal. I am currently powerless to stop it.  I can only let it have its fill."

The two watched as Lingyou Wang was devoured by the Divine Seal, leaving no trace behind except for a few items.

Fortunately, at the last moment, Zuo Zhenren mustered his remaining strength and managed to preserve Lingyou Wang's demon core.

‘Boom!’

The Arctic Ghost Slaying Seal created a large crater in the ground, scattering items everywhere.

‘Whoosh!’

After storing the Divine Seal in his sleeve, Zuo Zhenren, his old wounds aggravated and further weakened, didn't even bother to glance at the spoils. He sat down cross-legged to meditate and recover.

The Golden Armored Warriors formed a large formation, protecting Zuo Zhenren within. With Lingyou Wang dead, they were clearly guarding against Qin Sang.

This was only natural, and Qin Sang didn't mind. He made sure to maintain a distance to avoid any misunderstandings.

He glanced at the crater, seeing a black demon core and a smooth, luminous pearl.

Two spiritual treasures were also scattered nearby, along with some broken scales and fragments of the scale shield.

“The pearl should be a spatial storage treasure…”

Qin Sang didn’t move, retrieving his gaze after a brief scan.  He swallowed a few pills and focused on restoring his energy.

His Wood Spirit Body hadn't reached its limit, but his true essence was severely depleted. Despite his internal injuries, his condition was better than Zuo Zhenren’s.

He appeared calm, but his mind was filled with a rare excitement.

He hadn’t expected such a fortunate turn of events.

This battle held great significance for him. Not only had he met a Grand Master of the Dao Court, but the sensation of slaying Lingyou Wang with a single sword strike would provide him with insights to ponder and savor for a long time.

“Even without obtaining the Adamantine Fruit, this journey was worth it!” Qin Sang thought to himself.

After meditating, Qin Sang regained his senses, temporarily suppressing his internal injuries. His true essence had recovered enough to allow him to use Thunder Escape several times. He looked down at his slightly damaged Bright Mountain Armor and then towards Zuo Zhenren in the distance.

Judging by his complexion, he had slightly recovered.

Qin Sang spoke, “This is a dangerous place. It would be best to leave. I know of a safe place for us to recuperate, not far from here. What are your thoughts, Senior?”

Lingyou Wang had surely left markers while pursuing him.

Qin Sang wasn't afraid of Dingxiang Hou and the others. He had injured Dingxiang Hou, and the other demon lords were relatively weak. Even if they pursued him, seeing this scene, it was questionable whether they would dare to enter.

His concern was that there might be other Demon Kings nearby. Lingyou Wang’s recklessness had been his undoing.

After weighing his options, he decided it was best to leave. The next illusory realm he had chosen wasn’t far.

Zuo Zhenren remained silent and motionless.

The Golden Armored Warrior at the front spoke, its voice deep and resonant, yet carrying Zuo Zhenren’s tone.

“Very well. Please lead the way, fellow Daoist. You may collect those items first.”

As the voice faded, the Golden Armored Warriors simultaneously swung their golden chains, forming a golden disc beneath Zuo Zhenren.

With a shout, the Golden Armored Warriors lifted the golden disc, transforming into palanquin bearers.  Wreathed in golden light, they rose into the air.

With a wave of his sleeve, Qin Sang separated a wisp of true essence, gathering the spoils from the ground. He didn't store them in the Thousand Jun Ring, but let them float beside him. He then pierced through the sky wall first, discerning their direction.

Zuo Zhenren followed closely behind.

Upon exiting the sky wall and encountering no powerful enemies, Qin Sang felt a slight relief. He then heard the Golden Armored Warrior speak, “No wonder Fellow Daoist Zhijian values you so highly.  Even among the rising stars of the Dao Court, few can match you.”

“Are you well acquainted with Fellow Daoist Zhijian, Senior?” Qin Sang asked curiously.

“We have some history,” Zuo Zhenren replied, seemingly unwilling to elaborate.

Qin Sang wisely refrained from further questioning, shaking his head. “Senior flatters me. I know my own limitations.  Were it not for Senior, I would have been forced to flee in disarray, and might not have lived to see another day.”

As he spoke, Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at the demon core beside him.

“I will need to bring this demon core back to the Dao Court,” the Golden Armored Warrior said, pointing at the demon core and stating his request directly. “Of course, you deserve half the credit, and you will be recognized.  Given the special circumstances, this demon core should be considered a true Demon King's core… If you are not at ease, you may keep it for now.”

Qin Sang also desired the Demon King's demon core. But after careful consideration, he nodded in agreement.

“As for those…”

The Golden Armored Warrior glanced at the remaining three items. “Let us simply divide them equally.”

Qin Sang was naturally delighted.  He commanded the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to stand guard and extended his divine sense into the luminous pearl, discovering restrictions within.

These restrictions were unlike anything he had ever seen before, incredibly profound.

Fearing he might damage the treasures inside, Qin Sang didn't dare to act rashly.  However, Zuo Zhenren understood them. Under his guidance, Qin Sang gradually grasped the intricacies.

Before long, they traversed several illusory realms, their destination just ahead.

“It’s there,” Qin Sang pointed, taking the lead and passing through the illusory realm’s barrier.

Wood Spirit Qi washed over him, but it was much thinner than in the jungle realm.

This was a world with hundreds of floating islands. Most were covered in vegetation, permeated by an air of deathly stillness. The floating islands concealed dangers, but of a different kind, and the deeper one went, the more perilous it became.

Qin Sang selected a suitable floating island and set up a poison formation, though it wasn't needed.

He landed on one of the islands at the edge.  A while later, the Golden Armored Warriors, carrying Zuo Zhenren, entered and landed on a neighboring island.

For a moment, silence reigned.

Finally, the luminous pearl in Qin Sang’s hand shone brightly. As soon as the light appeared, Qin Sang used a spell to conceal it.

In the next instant, the pearl emitted a beam of light, carrying various items that scattered across the ground.

The Golden Armored Warrior also looked over.

Qin Sang gestured with his hand, sweeping his gaze over the scattered spoils.  He felt momentarily dazed by the sheer variety.

While they agreed to divide the treasures equally, it ultimately relied on their individual discernment.  Missing out on a valuable treasure due to ignorance couldn’t be blamed on the other party.

After looking for a while, Qin Sang developed a headache. Some treasures were clearly extraordinary, but they were things he had never seen or heard of, making it impossible to judge their value.

The Swallowing Seas Clam and the white rope were also among the items.

In addition, there were two more spiritual treasures within the pearl that Lingyou Wang hadn't used. Perhaps he didn't understand the Treasure Refining Art.

Moreover, at Lingyou Wang’s level, quality mattered more than quantity when it came to spiritual treasures.  Any excess would be bestowed upon subordinates, and the Swallowing Seas Clam was clearly different from ordinary spiritual treasures.

As expected, none of the four spiritual treasures had Treasure Refining Arts associated with them.

“Fellow Daoist, you wouldn't mind if I took these spiritual treasures, would you?” the Golden Armored Warrior asked, indicating the treasures.

This was a gesture of goodwill. Sending the spiritual treasures to the Dao Court would allow the Daoist disciples to try them one by one, eventually finding someone compatible. In Qin Sang’s hands, they would only be wasted and couldn't be sold for a high price.

Qin Sang was more than happy to oblige.  He proactively offered the four spiritual treasures, pondering which items he should choose for himself.

Just then, the Altar space began to tremble.  The tremors had been frequent during this period.

The Golden Armored Warrior turned to look towards the depths of the Altar.  After a moment of contemplation, he asked, “Fellow Daoist Qingfeng, having achieved such great merit, what reward do you intend to request from the Dao Court?”

From beginning to end, Zuo Zhenren hadn't asked Qin Sang why Lingyou Wang had been pursuing him, and Qin Sang had feigned ignorance.

Qin Sang raised his head, thought seriously for a moment, then rose and bowed respectfully.  “This junior is well aware of the hardships of cultivation and lacks a proper master. My original intention was to inquire about the secrets of the Five Talismans realm and the essentials of cultivation…  I wonder what these merits can be exchanged for, and if Senior could perhaps instruct me?”

“The essentials of cultivation… You are truly a seeker of the Dao. However…”

The Golden Armored Warrior nodded approvingly, then posed a question, “Do you know why I and those Demon Kings are willing to sever our own cultivation to enter the Altar?”

“My entry here was purely accidental. I am unaware,” Qin Sang shook his head, truly ignorant.

“The ancient Daoist sects once established a Divine Court, the very foundation of talismanic arts…”  Zuo Zhenren began to explain.

He couldn’t be as detailed as the old Daoist had been.  Without revealing true secrets, a concise explanation that allowed Qin Sang to understand the general situation would suffice. (End of Chapter)
