<h1>Chapter 1454: Exposure</h1><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren, with the Hun Mo Order above his head, stepped out from the ghost mist.</p><p>Lightning struck the Hun Mo Order; electric light flowed across its surface, like a silvery coat, deflecting the attack.</p><p>Because Qin Sang hadn't used his full power, and the Hun Mo Order's inherent power was extraordinary, the old man wasn't harmed in the slightest.</p><p>At the same time,</p><p>a wisp of ghost mist subtly appeared where Hun Mo Lao Ren had been. It was much more diffuse than before, and after writhing for a moment, it reformed into a ghost spirit, its body more transparent.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren and the ghost spirit had switched places.</p><p>This ghost spirit was crafted using a method he'd derived from studying ancient demonic arts.  It had consumed countless rare treasures, his own blood, and the souls of cultivators, making the investment in it comparable to any magic weapon.</p><p>The ghost spirit and Hun Mo Lao Ren were linked in mind, existing almost as an avatar. It possessed not only immense demonic power but also the incredible ability of shapeshifting.</p><p>Such spatial manipulation was beyond compare!</p><p>This scene chilled everyone present, including Qin Sang.</p><p>With this ability, anyone falling into Hun Mo Lao Ren's grasp would be trapped.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had noticed that Hun Mo Lao Ren's speed wasn't as fast as his, and by decisively disengaging, he'd put some distance between them.  His enhanced spiritual sense meant Hun Mo Lao Ren could no longer lock onto him from a distance; being out of his sight meant safety.</p><p>But before he could celebrate, Hun Mo Lao Ren crossed the void, instantly closing the distance.</p><p>This ability greatly surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>He recalled a previous question. During the treasure scramble at the Golden Summit Temple, he wondered why Hun Mo Lao Ren hadn't used the ghost spirit.  Otherwise, he would have faced the old man's true form, been forced to act, and revealed himself then.</p><p>As he pondered, Qin Sang noticed the ghost spirit was much weaker than before, circling hesitantly in the rear, unwilling to join the fight.</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang: he guessed the shapeshifting ability had significant limitations and high consumption, much like Chen Yan's strange ability, and couldn't be used consecutively.</p><p>This eased his tension somewhat.  Otherwise, he would have doubted whether his two backup plans could stop Hun Mo Lao Ren.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The thunder shook the earth.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren emerged from the lightning, his cloudy eyes fixing on Qin Sang with cold indifference, his pupils reflecting the dazzling sword light.</p><p>Seeing his enemy, Qin Sang knew there would be no peaceful resolution. Hun Mo Lao Ren targeting him instead of his enemies at Xuan Tian Palace clearly meant the old man had noticed or guessed something.</p><p>Any attack would be overwhelming, relentless, and unwavering.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bother questioning him. Without a word, he launched a sword strike.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren remained impassive.  Without visible movement, the Hun Mo Order above his head flashed to the front, emitting a strange 'whooshing' sound.</p><p>The Hun Mo Order hung in the air, transforming into a hundred-zhang-tall phantom, like a massive wall of light.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword arrived instantly. Its sharp light pierced deep into the illusory wall, but the resistance increased, forcing the light to retract.</p><p>At that moment, Hun Mo Lao Ren let out a cold snort.</p><p>The Hun Mo Order soared above the Jin Chen Sword. The illusory wall rapidly condensed towards its center, seeming to carry immense force as it pressed down, suppressing the sword.</p><p>'Buzz…buzz…buzz…'</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword, being of lower grade, couldn't withstand the pressure and trembled.</p><p>Sensing the terrifying pressure on the sword, Qin Sang's expression tightened.  He retreated rapidly while continuously using sword techniques, employing the same tactic – deploying a sword array.</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword then turned from defense to offense, the array enveloping the Hun Mo Order, attempting to draw Hun Mo Lao Ren into it.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang's plan failed.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren, somewhat familiar with Qin Sang's swordsmanship, exploited the Jin Chen Sword's low grade and his own high cultivation and the Hun Mo Order's high grade to force Qin Sang to use his sword array prematurely.</p><p>This allowed Hun Mo Lao Ren to evade easily, avoiding being trapped.</p><p>He tapped the Black Bamboo Staff in the void.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren flashed several times, appearing tens of zhang away, successfully escaping the range of the sword array before it formed.</p><p>Only the Hun Mo Order remained in the Seven Souls Killing Array.</p><p>The old man, Hun Mo, glanced at the sword array, a strange sound escaping his throat.  Immediately, the Hun Mo Order vibrated violently, emitting a resonant chime. In an instant, countless beams of light burst forth. Any other sword array or defensive measure would have been shattered and riddled with weaknesses by such power.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless. The sword array shifted endlessly, countless sword threads gathering and dispersing constantly. Seemingly chaotic, it was actually highly organized, annihilating the beams of light.</p><p>On the surface, neither side seemed able to overcome the other.  Only Qin Sang knew the immense pressure he was under. He felt more exhausted than when he faced the Xuan Tian Palace, and this was only the beginning.  Against an opponent like Hun Mo, even a high-quality spirit sword was insufficient. He had to refine the Jin Chen Sword as soon as he returned!</p><p>Seeing this, a look of seriousness appeared in Hun Mo's eyes.  In terms of sword array techniques alone, his opponent was worthy of renown throughout the boundless sea.  Hun Mo secretly wondered: given his opponent's strength, obtaining a top-grade spirit sword shouldn't be too difficult. Otherwise, facing the sword array at its full strength, he would have to be far more cautious.</p><p>After testing the power of the sword array, Hun Mo ceased his attention on it, shifting his gaze to Qin Sang. He lightly raised his black bamboo staff, and a beam of light shot out.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled. The demonic flames forming his fire armor flowed back into his sleeves.  With a flick of his wrist, a series of small demonic banners flew out.</p><p>It was time to stop hiding.  Let's measure the true strength of this Grand Cultivator!</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Without seeing the demonic flames, but only the banners, Hun Mo recognized that uniquely familiar aura. A furious roar escaped him, his killing intent reaching the heavens!</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled sarcastically. "Why are you so enraged, friend? Are you allowed to ambush, but I'm not allowed to retaliate?"</p><p>Before his words finished, streams of demonic fire erupted from the banners, transforming into a fiery dragon that swallowed the beam of light without much effort.</p><p>At that moment, the Xuan Tian Palace disciples, far behind, widened their eyes in disbelief.  The mysterious person who had toyed with them so cruelly hadn't even used his full strength. Even from this distance, they felt a chilling sense of dread.</p><p>Two elders exchanged glances, their faces fluctuating between pale and ashen. When they saw Hun Mo make his move, they were worried about the sacred object falling into the wrong hands. Now they realized they had been overly anxious.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivator protecting Shi Xue and the other followed, swallowing nervously. He muttered, "Even if the Grand Elder were here, he might not be able to hold him back."</p><p>Silence fell.  They were reluctant to admit it, but it might be true. The Grand Elder might be able to defeat him, but holding him would be difficult.  Unless they had prior knowledge of his strength, and prepared thoroughly beforehand, leaving no openings whatsoever.</p>
