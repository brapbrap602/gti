<h1>Chapter 654: Entanglement</h1><p>The Five Insects Sect's main hall was severely damaged by the battle, a far cry from its former glory. The square in front of the hall was littered with deep craters and fissures, bearing the marks of fire and flood – clear evidence of cultivator combat.</p><p>The hall was deathly silent.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi's eyes were gloomy as he silently gazed at the devastated sect gate and the bodies of his fellow disciples, his face etched with sorrow.</p><p>Across from him stood two middle-aged men, both peak Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>They both wore a token bearing the character 'Li' on their waists.</p><p>One of them stood with his hands behind his back, exuding an imposing aura that visibly intimidated Cui Xuanzi.</p><p>The other, a burly man, sat weakly in a chair, clutching his chest and abdomen. His face was pale and bloodless, clearly severely injured.</p><p>These two were disciples of the Li Witch Palace; the standing one was named Du Xian, and the injured one, Jiu Shan.</p><p>Besides them, another, even worse off, lay unconscious on the ground, though his breathing was steady, indicating that his life wasn't in immediate danger.</p><p>Seeing Cui Xuanzi's demeanor, Du Xian scoffed, saying indifferently, "Sect Master Cui Xuan, why the theatrics? They were just a few useless disciples; their deaths are inconsequential. Once my junior brother brings our master here, captures that old ghost Qin, and retrieves the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, we'll petition our master to grant you credit for this. With you, Sect Master Cui Xuan, and the Li Witch Palace's protection, restoring the Five Insects Sect will be a breeze."</p><p>At this, Jiu Shan coughed violently, before glaring at Cui Xuanzi and shouting, "You dared to disobey the Li Witch Palace's orders and use a magical treasure to injure my senior brother and me? Killing a few of your disciples is letting you off lightly! If my senior brother hadn't pleaded for you, I would have annihilated you right then and there!"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi clenched his fists, suppressing his anger, "You used the Li Witch Palace's name to deceive me into opening the gates, welcoming you in, only to attack my people.  Were you expecting me to simply stand by and let you slaughter us? The Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit was already taken by Old Ghost Qin.  If you had simply asked for it, this battle, and the death of so many of my disciples, would have been avoided!"</p><p>Du Xian and Jiu Shan exchanged an awkward glance.</p><p>Their mission for the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit involved two peak Foundation Establishment cultivators, the others at least mid-Core Formation, skilled in combined attacks; they hadn't considered the Five Insects Sect a threat.</p><p>But they hadn't anticipated Cui Xuanzi possessing a magical treasure, which caught them off guard and severely injured Jiu Shan and another disciple.</p><p>Fortunately, before Cui Xuanzi could prepare the treasure, they had either killed or captured all of the Five Insects Sect's Core Formation cultivators, leaving Cui Xuanzi alone.</p><p>If they hadn't used the Li Witch Palace's name to trick their way in, the outcome of the battle would have been uncertain.</p><p>What surprised them was Cui Xuanzi's claim that the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit had already been taken by a Gold Core cultivator and was no longer in the Five Insects Sect. They'd come to the wrong place.</p><p>Du Xian coughed lightly, turning toward the gate, "Where exactly is that Gold Core cultivator's lover hiding? Why haven't Junior Brother and your men returned after so long?"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi sneered, "What's the hurry? Old Ghost Qin has several cave dwellings in the Xiong Mountain region; the woman could be in any of them. We can only have Junior Brother Tong and his men search each one."</p><p>Jiu Shan narrowed his eyes, staring at Cui Xuanzi and abruptly shouted, "You old dog, if you dare use any more tricks, I swear I'll erase the Five Insects Sect from Xijiang today!"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi exploded with rage, gritting his teeth, "My Junior Brother Tong is under your control, I'm trapped here, my sect is occupied, my treasures have been plundered.  What tricks could I possibly use? I am the only peak Foundation Establishment cultivator in the Five Insects Sect. You've seen my spirit insect; it's stuck in its second metamorphosis, I can't use the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit. I even showed you the Black Wind Valley; the unique fragrance of a mature fruit is impossible to mask. As soon as it ripened, Old Ghost Qin found and took it! If he weren't gone, none of you would have escaped!"</p><p>"If that Gold Core cultivator were still here, we wouldn't have dared to barge in so recklessly,"</p><p>Du Xian scoffed, "That person only recently achieved Gold Core; my master achieved it decades ago and is on the verge of breaking through to mid-Gold Core. Once master arrives, killing him will be child's play; don't expect him to save you. Cooperate, and you won't be treated badly."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi fell silent, his eyes flashing with intense killing intent.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi didn't believe a single word Du Xian said!</p><p>Cui Xuanzi knew that once the mute woman was found, he would be of no further use and these people would surely kill him in a fit of rage.  So, when his junior brother Tong left to find the mute woman, Cui Xuanzi subtly suggested he take a longer, more circuitous route, buying time.</p><p>Ironically, this act by Cui Xuanzi gave the mute woman precious time to escape.</p><p>Du Xian, seemingly unaware of Cui Xuanzi's intentions, turned to Jiu Shan and said, "Junior Brother, where did that person go? We need to catch his accomplice to get answers.  Looking for the insects will take three or five years at least. Remember how Senior Brother Qiu spent eight years guarding the lair of an ice toad, almost failing in the end?  Even so, we should be cautious. Junior Brother, go and ask Master; a round trip will take at least half a month.  During this time, we should find somewhere to hide to avoid accidents."</p><p>Mentioning this, Jiu Shan also dropped his aggressive demeanor, his expression turning grave.</p><p>They spoke confidently, but in their hearts, they knew the vast difference between a fake Golden Core and a true Golden Core cultivator.  Even a newly-minted Golden Core cultivator could easily kill them all.</p><p>Just as Du Xian and Jiu Shan were conferring, they suddenly felt the ground tremble.</p><p>The three men's faces changed drastically.  They abruptly turned towards the mountain gate, only to see a dazzling sword energy, cleaving down from the sky, striking the Lotus Formation with brutal force.</p><p>The sword energy blazed like thunder.</p><p>The Wu Chong Sect's protective mountain formation shuddered violently, cracked directly by this single blow. The Lotus Formation became as fragile as glass, beginning to collapse.</p><p>One sword shattered the formation!</p><p>Only then did the thunderous roar of the sword's arrival echo.</p><p>The mountains shook, the power of this single strike leaving the three men petrified with fear.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>Du Xian was shocked and terrified.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was utterly shaken.  He recognized the sword energy, a strange expression on his face as he muttered, "Why now… why return now… give me a few more hours! Just a few hours!"</p><p>His face was a strange mixture of regret and despair.</p><p>"The Wu Chong Sect is doomed!"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi cried out in anguish, falling backward with a thud, having broken his own heart and died.</p><p>Du Xian and Jiu Shan were startled by Cui Xuanzi's decisive action. Before they could react, a second sword followed, shattering the Wu Chong Sect's protective formation completely.</p>
