<h1>Chapter 817: Unexpected Guests</h1><p>During this period, Qin Sang racked his brains, trying to lure Luo Daotong out of the island.</p><p>But this is the heart of the territory controlled by both righteous and demonic cultivators, so Qin Sang couldn't act recklessly.  Too much commotion might attract other powerful cultivators from nearby islands.</p><p>He devised many plans, but abandoned them all.</p><p>If he could use the Sky-Eye Butterfly to uncover the flaws in the island's protective array, he wouldn't have to wait any longer.</p><p>Qin Sang flew from Nandou Island towards Liangqiu Island, halfway there he concealed his aura using the *Dunling Jue* (遁灵诀).</p><p>Soon, Liangqiu Island came into view.</p><p>The island wasn't large, but it was spiritually rich, concealing a top-tier spiritual vein.</p><p>Because of this, Luo Daotong had almost completely enveloped the entire island within a protective array. From the outside, only a vague mountain silhouette was visible.</p><p>It was still before dawn, the darkest hour before sunrise.</p><p>The island's array shimmered with strange lights, shining brightly, as if echoing the stars in the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang watched from afar for a while, then continued to approach stealthily, but he didn't dare to be so bold as to land directly on the island. He stopped on the sea near the island.</p><p>He held his breath, floating motionless on the surface, rising and falling with the waves, then released the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The butterfly landed on his shoulder, its wings unfolded, its sky-eye focused on Liangqiu Island.</p><p>Qin Sang connected his mind with it, and the 'view' gradually changed.</p><p>His sight pierced through layers of strange lights, finally seeing the outline of the mountain peak.</p><p>A solitary peak stood tall, extremely steep.</p><p>A white line cascaded down the mountain, likely a waterfall.</p><p>Due to the distance, the view wasn't very clear; he couldn't locate Luo Daotong's dwelling yet. Qin Sang wasn't worried, he withdrew his gaze, focusing on the strange lights.</p><p>The strange lights were the manifestations of the protective array.  Not only did they serve as a deception, but they also possessed considerable power.</p><p>Each light contained countless runes.</p><p>An hour later, as dawn approached, Qin Sang rubbed his forehead, lost in thought.</p><p>“It’s an unprecedented array, incredibly powerful. I seem to have spotted a few weaknesses, but further verification is needed. However, to assassinate Luo Daotong, simply finding a breach and breaking through the array isn't enough. I need speed, to catch him off guard, and finish it quickly. That's too difficult. I must completely decipher this protective array, and that’s not something that can be done overnight.”</p><p>Qin Sang noted down the runes he had seen, preparing to analyze them later, then quietly withdrew.</p><p>Back in his cave, Qin Sang secluded himself to study the runes.</p><p>Luo Daotong was indeed extraordinary; his protective array was extremely complex. Qin Sang admitted he couldn't create something like it; there must be a powerful expert guiding him.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang discovered that the island's protective array wasn't a single one, but several arrays layered upon each other, making it impregnable.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the Sky-Eye Butterfly; otherwise, it would have been impossible to understand the connections between these arrays.  Entering the island would have resulted in an immediate attack.</p><p>“Too complex.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, only able to patiently study the runes, searching for patterns.  Every few days, he would visit again, observing the array and verifying his understanding.</p><p>If he could touch the array and experience it firsthand, his progress would be much faster. Because he didn't dare to land on the island, he couldn't see the entire array, thus his progress was slow, and his standards were high.</p><p>After nearly a month, he finally understood some of the patterns.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as he was overjoyed, an unexpected event occurred without warning.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang, fatigued from days of continuous study of the array, temporarily stopped and was practicing physical cultivation outdoors when a pillar of light suddenly shot up from the sea.</p><p>The sudden change startled Qin Sang awake. He opened his eyes and was surprised to find that the light pillar originated from Liangqiu Island.</p><p>He moved swiftly to the top of the mountain to observe.</p><p>The light pillar disappeared as quickly as it appeared.</p><p>But then, strange lights reappeared in that direction.</p><p>Clearly visible in the darkness, countless strange lights erupted, almost illuminating half the sky, like a mass of flames composed of different colors, wildly dancing in the night sky.</p><p>These lights fluctuated, sometimes erupting, sometimes disappearing.</p><p>At the same time, waves surged from that direction.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely bewildered, immediately and without hesitation, flying towards the source of the light.</p><p>Soon, he saw the origin of the strange lights.</p><p>“That’s Liangqiu Island! Someone is attacking the island! How could this be? Besides me, others have also targeted Liangqiu Island. Why was there no sign at all? I've networked with many nearby cultivators and haven't detected anything unusual!”</p><p>Qin Sang was at a loss, completely unclear about what had happened.</p><p>He was close to understanding the island's protective array, ready to strike soon, when a mysterious individual unexpectedly intervened.  This was unforeseen by Qin Sang.</p><p>The mysterious person's identity was a mystery, their attack completely unannounced.  Their audacity in directly assaulting the island, disrupting the protective array, and causing such a commotion was astonishing.</p><p>The brilliant light was the manifestation of the protective array. Initially, it resembled a towering pillar of light, then illuminated half the sky, but its intensity gradually weakened.  Clearly, the attacker was either incredibly powerful or exceptionally skilled in array manipulation.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, immediately realizing that regardless of their own grievances, if this mysterious person could test Luo Daotong's abilities, it might not be a bad thing.  However, he didn't want to leave just yet; there might be an opportunity to take advantage of the chaos.</p><p>But he had to be mindful of the time.  The mysterious person probably didn't know that Luo Daotong had a Nascent Soul master backing him. The commotion caused by the attack was bound to alert others; reinforcements would arrive soon.  Before that happened, if he could seize Luo Daotong in the confusion, he could pin the blame on this attacker. Even if he didn't get a chance to strike, he could use the opportunity to observe which island master was behind Luo Daotong.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. He immediately concealed his aura and hurried to observe the battle.</p><p>On his way, Qin Sang kept an eye on the battlefield. He noticed that although the brilliant light was fading, it was remarkably persistent, not extinguishing, indicating that Luo Daotong was holding his own against the surprise attack.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly scoffed, "Unable to even break through the protective array yet attempting to attack the island?  What a waste of an opportunity!  Clearly a reckless brute!"</p><p>Soon, Liangqiu Island came into view.  From a distance, he could see the brilliant light erupting from Liangqiu Island, engulfing the entire island.  A fierce battle was underway, punctuated by roars and the shockwaves of collisions, causing huge waves around the island—a scene of utter chaos.</p><p>It was impossible to discern the situation clearly with the naked eye. Qin Sang had never met Luo Daotong, so he wasn't sure if the roars were his.</p><p>"They're locked in fierce combat. This person is unlikely to kill Luo Daotong; they're too rash! If I'd discovered this person earlier, I wouldn't have wasted so much time."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, then approached further, releasing his Sky-Eye Butterfly to secretly observe the battle.</p><p>The butterfly's vision pierced the brilliant light, revealing a surprisingly unexpected sight.  There were three people on the island, but only one was attacking the array!</p>
