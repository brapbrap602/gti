<h1>Chapter 1831: Return to the Buddha Pagoda</h1><p>Sword Heart Island.</p><p>Sword energy crisscrossed the air.</p><p>Qin Sang and Zhi Jian Zhenren sat in the central courtyard, cups in hand, observing two orchid leaves weaving and clashing.</p><p>The sword energy emanated from the orchid leaves.</p><p>The two used the orchid leaves as swords, exchanging pointers on swordsmanship.</p><p>After a stick of incense, the two orchid leaf swords touched and parted, the clear ringing of sword cries echoing throughout Sword Heart Island.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren, about to bring the wine in his cup to his lips, paused slightly, his gaze falling on Qin Sang. “It's been years, and your swordsmanship has become even more refined, Brother. Your skill has nearly undergone a transformation.”</p><p>Qin Sang took a sip of wine, nodding with a smile.</p><p>The *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* and the Chengying Sword inheritance complemented each other. As Qin Sang progressed in his cultivation, his swordsmanship naturally improved.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't complacent. He clearly felt that Zhi Jian Zhenren had been holding back during their exchange.</p><p>“If my cultivation were equal to Zhi Jian Zhenren's, I wonder if I could force him to use eighty percent of his strength…”</p><p>Qin Sang believed that with the *Poison God Classic*, his cultivation speed was unmatched, and catching up to Zhi Jian Zhenren shouldn't be difficult. However, he wasn't as confident in his swordsmanship.</p><p>This exchange was, in fact, a form of guidance.</p><p>The stronger Qin Sang became, the more he could appreciate Zhi Jian Zhenren’s profound mastery of the sword, sighing inwardly.</p><p>“I increasingly anticipate the day your swordsmanship reaches its peak, Brother, so we can truly battle to our heart's content!”  Zhi Jian Zhenren laughed heartily, draining his cup, then pointed at his orchid leaf sword.</p><p>Suddenly, the night air rustled.</p><p>Sword light flashed like lightning, the sword momentum abruptly shifting. It was like a sudden storm, making it difficult for onlookers to even breathe.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang’s sword was shattered into pieces.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly, cupping his hands in surrender.</p><p>The sword light vanished.</p><p>A single orchid leaf softly drifted to the ground. It was hard to imagine that such fierce swordsmanship had been wielded with this leaf.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren stood, gazing at the vast sky.</p><p>The bright moon hung high, its light like water.</p><p>He seemed to be admiring the moon, yet also seemed to be gazing into the depths of the night sky, murmuring, “The Way of the Sword prioritizes the Sword Heart. Brother, do you possess a Sword Heart?”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned. He closed his eyes, sinking into deep contemplation.</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, Zhi Jian Zhenren’s heart was entirely devoted to the sword, seeking nothing else.</p><p>He, on the other hand, was the opposite. His knowledge was vast and eclectic, rare in the world. As long as it could help him improve and bring him closer to immortality, whether righteous, demonic, or monstrous, he treated it all equally, learning and utilizing it.</p><p>The path of eclecticism also had its advantages.</p><p>Qin Sang had reached this point by relying on the Jade Buddha, avoiding the flaws of any single path, not clinging to any one method.</p><p>The combination of various methods sometimes resulted in unexpected and wondrous changes.</p><p>When facing enemies, Qin Sang held a distinct advantage. His opponents were more or less countered by him. No matter the danger, he could always find a way to cope.</p><p>However, even with his current strength, facing Zhi Jian Zhenren, he didn't feel assured of victory!</p><p>To reach the Sword Heart realm that Zhi Jian Zhenren spoke of, did he have to, like him, focus solely on the sword?</p><p>“Cultivation nurtures the sword, Chengying bequeaths the sword; it seems the Way of the Sword is indeed my best choice. But can I truly abandon all other paths?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. “Was Zhi Jian Zhenren advising me to return to the righteous path, or was he warning me not to be lost in the Way of the Sword?”</p><p>The moon shifted westward.</p><p>By the time Qin Sang came back to his senses, Zhi Jian Zhenren was gone, leaving only leftover food and drink, and the cool night breeze.</p><p>And, the orchid leaves in the courtyard.</p><p>…</p><p>As he flew away from Sword Heart Island, Qin Sang continued to ponder.</p><p>Leaving Star Island’s Immortal Lake, he traveled southeast, heading to Mirror Terrace Temple. The appointed time was approaching; it was time to ascend the Buddha Pagoda once more!</p><p>At the peak of a perilous mountain, Qin Sang stood at the summit, overlooking the official road below.</p><p>As night fell, the road was still bustling with people, some even lighting torches, preparing to travel through the night.</p><p>Most were heading east; very few were going the opposite direction.</p><p>This place wasn't far from Mirror Terrace Temple, situated right at the boundary between the human settlements of Mount Ju and the Demon Kingdom.</p><p>These mortals were actually willingly migrating to the Demon Kingdom.</p><p>In the past, mortals in the Demon Kingdom were treated like cattle and horses, serving as food for demon beasts, slaughtered at will, suffering immensely. Countless mortals had desperately fled, seeking refuge with human sects.</p><p>Now, the situation was reversed.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't sense any demon cultivators nearby, nor were there any guards driving people away from the road. These mortals were willingly seeking refuge in the Demon Kingdom.</p><p>Qin Sang paused for a moment, changed direction, and followed the flow of people into the Demon Kingdom’s territory. After investigating, he realized his suspicions were correct.</p><p>The demon race was flourishing under the Way of the Demon God.</p><p>The Demon God’s priority was to gather believers, the more the better, to maintain a steady stream of incense, abandoning their past practice of harming mortals.</p><p>Various rumors had spread into human territories.</p><p>While mortals in human territories faced no threat of death, life was still arduous, and prosperity was elusive.</p><p>Upon learning that the Demon God not only protected his believers but also fulfilled their wishes and displayed divine miracles at intervals, requiring only pious worship in return, some daring individuals ventured across the border to investigate. Finding the rumors true, they called upon their friends and family, and now it had become a trend.</p><p>Within the Demon Kingdom, a scene of prosperity unfolded.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly withdrew from the Demon Kingdom, continuing on to Mirror Terrace Temple without further delay.</p><p>Presumably due to Venerable Zhenru’s prior instructions, as soon as Qin Sang arrived at the temple gates, before even announcing his Dharma name, the gatekeeper acolyte’s face lit up with surprise. He immediately opened the gates, respectfully welcoming Qin Sang into the temple.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru was in secluded cultivation. Upon receiving the news, he immediately emerged to greet Qin Sang.</p><p>Inside the quiet room, after dismissing everyone else, Venerable Zhenru sighed deeply, “Daoist, you've kept this poor monk waiting. I wonder if you’ve made a decision?”</p><p>“I’ve come precisely because of our agreement,” Qin Sang said frankly. “This time, ascending the Buddha Pagoda, I have at least a seventy percent chance of breaking the final seal!”</p><p>His tone was filled with confidence.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru was overjoyed at these words. However, he didn’t immediately head towards the Buddha Pagoda. First, he brought out several treasures.</p><p>These were meticulously collected by the eminent monks of Mirror Terrace Temple, meant to help withstand the threats within the pagoda.</p><p>Qin Sang readily accepted, selecting a few and refining them under Venerable Zhenru’s guidance.</p><p>Fully prepared, the two entered the mountain ravine, arriving at the entrance of the Buddha Pagoda.</p><p>Having attempted the pagoda multiple times decades ago, Qin Sang was very familiar with it, eliminating the need for lengthy explanations.</p><p>The two cooperated seamlessly, ascending five levels in one go, reaching the sixth-level seal.</p><p>With the aid of the treasures, they were in excellent condition.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru raised his hand, pressed it against the seal, glanced at Qin Sang, and forcefully shattered it.</p><p>The moment the seal broke, Qin Sang rushed into the sixth level like a whirlwind, witnessing a familiar scene.</p><p>Eighteen bronze monks faced the entrance. Just as they were bowing, Qin Sang, without hesitation, charged towards them, fists flying!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The force of his fists was like thunder.</p><p>The bronze monks’ expressions remained unchanged as they formed a defensive formation, eighteen bronze staffs striking out at Qin Sang in unison.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…’</p><p>Gusts of wind converged into a single force.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's understanding of the eighteen bronze monks, this attack was one of the strongest variations of their formation.</p><p>Logically, they should have led the bronze monks to reveal weaknesses, breaking the formation piece by piece, rather than confronting it head-on.</p><p>However, this was precisely the most efficient method of breaking the formation that Qin Sang and Venerable Zhenru had devised after careful analysis.</p><p>A tremendous ‘Boom’ resonated as fists met staffs, Qin Sang’s body trembling violently.</p><p>Time seemed to freeze at this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang’s fists resisted the eighteen bronze staffs. Then, with a muffled groan, his aura surged wildly, a faint golden light, not the glazed light of before, flowing through his body.</p><p>At this moment, his right fist seemed to expand, possessing the momentum to shatter all obstacles.</p><p>The eighteen bronze monks were also unwilling to yield. Golden Buddhist light connected them as they roared in unison, their bronze staffs pressing down fiercely.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A powerful burst of energy erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his fist, retreating rapidly.</p><p>The bronze monks’ staffs were flung back. Two of the monks even stumbled, causing a barely perceptible hesitation in their formation.</p><p>It was this hesitation that provided their opponents with an opportunity.</p><p>A giant jade-white palm suddenly appeared above one of the bronze monks’ heads, slamming down without warning.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru hadn’t attacked until now, waiting for this very opportunity. This strike was extremely precise; the other bronze monks couldn’t react in time.</p><p>With a ‘Crack’, the bronze monk's head exploded, golden powder scattering as its body collapsed.</p><p>With one monk down, the formation's weakness became even more apparent.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped his retreat, turning to charge back into the formation like a tiger pouncing on sheep, his movements like a phantom.</p><p>The bronze monks hastily organized a counterattack, but under the combined assault of Qin Sang and Venerable Zhenru, their chaos only intensified.</p><p>The Great Vajra Wheel Seal, including the Lotus Seal, was a powerful combat technique. Coupled with his Divine Eye, Qin Sang could see through all the changes in the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang moved through the formation as if it were empty, throwing three punches in quick succession.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Three more monks exploded.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru watched Qin Sang's display of might, a strange glint in his eyes. He noticed a difference in Qin Sang’s aura compared to decades ago, despite the latter utilizing the *Seven Masters’ Buddha Seal*.</p><p>However, due to Qin Sang's deliberate disguise, it would be difficult for others to guess that he possessed the complete Great Vajra Wheel Seal. They would only assume that he had gained enlightenment from the projections and improved his cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Venerable Zhenru joined forces, quickly reducing the eighteen bronze monks to only six.</p><p>Then, a scene that had once forced them to retreat replayed itself.</p><p>The bronze staffs clashed in the air, forming an illusion of a golden sun. As the bronze monks merged into it one by one, the golden light became incredibly intense.</p><p>A terrifying heat enveloped the two.</p><p>Both felt parched, as if they were about to be melted by the great sun.</p><p>Without hesitation, Venerable Zhenru sat cross-legged, raising his hand to conjure a silken canopy.</p><p>The canopy transformed into an umbrella above his head, warding off the blazing sun.</p><p>At the same time, multicolored lights shimmered around Venerable Zhenru.</p><p>Even with the protection of various treasures, Venerable Zhenru could only barely defend himself. He dared not be distracted, focusing all his energy on his protective techniques, placing all his hope on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Venerable Zhenru, gazed at the golden sun, and, to his surprise, leaped into the air, flying towards it.</p><p>Bathed in golden light, Qin Sang appeared to be cast in gold.</p><p>His back was straight, his silhouette determined as he advanced towards the dazzling light, disappearing into the blinding radiance, his body seemingly melting into the blazing sun.</p><p>He closed his eyes slightly, feeling a stinging pain and a terrifying power emanating from the golden sun.</p><p>There was no need to hide anymore.</p><p>Qin Sang fully unleashed the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, his body like pure glazed glass, though the glazed light was completely engulfed by the golden light.</p><p>With the Buddha Seal activated, Qin Sang was about to gather his momentum for a powerful charge when a thought suddenly struck him.</p><p>The moment he unleashed the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, the scorching heat of the golden sun seemed to weaken slightly.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, his gaze golden and piercing, as if trying to see through the golden sun, a faint realization dawning on him.</p><p>In the next instant, his speed increased instead of decreasing. He pushed the Great Vajra Wheel Seal to its limit, channeling the power of the Buddha Seal into his right fist, aiming at the center of the golden sun, and delivering a devastating blow!</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The Vajra Buddha Pagoda trembled violently.</p><p>Where Qin Sang’s fist connected, at the heart of the golden light, a black dot appeared. As the dot expanded, the golden sun shattered, golden streams of light scattering, sweeping across the entire sixth level.</p><p>This punch seemed to have opened a barrier, a suction force erupting from the black dot.</p><p>Qin Sang’s body tightened. He didn’t resist, allowing the force to pull him into the black dot.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru, who had been struggling to hold on, was also enveloped by the suction force, sighing in relief.</p><p>After the two departed, the sixth level quickly returned to normal, the golden light coalescing back into the eighteen bronze monks, who stood silently in place, awaiting the next challenger.</p><p>‘Splash…’</p><p>The sound of flowing water reached their ears.</p><p>Qin Sang and Venerable Zhenru entered a strange space, one after the other.</p><p>According to their deductions, this should be the seventh level of the Vajra Buddha Pagoda.</p><p>The scene in the seventh level was completely different from what they had imagined. There was a great river, its waters flowing powerfully.</p><p>The sky was high and the clouds were light, the river surging onward, resembling the real world.</p><p>Standing on the surface of the rushing river was a monk. This monk appeared young and handsome, wearing simple cloth robes and straw sandals, carrying nothing.</p><p>The monk stood with his hands hanging down, gazing in the direction of the flowing water, his eyes profound.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang and Venerable Zhenru entered, the monk turned slightly, looking towards them.</p><p>The instant their eyes met the monk’s gaze, both of them felt a tremendous shock.</p><p>The sensation was indescribable. They felt as if they weren’t facing a person, but a mountain, a sea, or even the heavens themselves, their own existence insignificant in comparison.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly recovered from his shock.</p><p>It was an illusion. The monk wasn’t looking at them; his deep gaze seemed to penetrate the void behind them.</p><p>Then, the monk raised his right hand, forming a hand seal.</p><p>His movements were seemingly slow but actually incredibly fast, each one deeply imprinted in their minds like a brand.</p><p>Both of them were deeply shaken, entering a strange state, unable to extricate themselves for a long time.</p><p>That single seal etched itself into their hearts, the monk’s movements replaying endlessly in their minds.</p><p>Then, they were jolted awake by a blinding golden light. They saw a golden sun rising from above the monk’s head, hanging high in the sky.</p><p>The golden sun shone brightly, vast and boundless.</p><p>This golden light was powerful enough to incinerate everything!</p><p>They were terrified, almost believing they were about to perish here, before realizing it was an illusion, the monk merely a phantom.</p><p>“This seal… the eighth of the Nine Glorious Seals, the Sun Wheel Seal!”</p><p>An ethereal voice echoed in their ears. Then, the monk and the golden sun gradually faded.</p><p>Finally, both the monk and the great river dissolved into nothingness.</p><p>The illusion dissipated, and the two found themselves in an empty room. This was the true seventh level of the Buddha Pagoda.</p><p>They gradually came back to their senses, exchanging glances, their eyes filled with both self-deprecation and joy.</p><p>As expected, this Vajra Buddha Pagoda was indeed a pagoda for transmitting Dharma!</p><p>The various challenges of the lower six levels were merely tests before the transmission.</p><p>They were self-deprecating because after seeing the monk demonstrate the seal, they understood. The golden sun manifested by the eighteen bronze monks was the Sun Wheel Seal.</p><p>With sufficient comprehension, one could gain enlightenment from the bronze monks without needing to forcefully reach the seventh level, gradually mastering the Sun Wheel Seal and thus earning the right to enter the seventh level.</p><p>Clearly, neither of them had achieved this, nor had the generations of eminent monks of Mirror Terrace Temple.</p><p>Their joy, of course, stemmed from their gains.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the immense power of the Nine Glorious Seals. He hadn’t expected to obtain another one in this world.  The two seals shared the same origin, which was why the pressure on him lessened in the final moments.</p><p>Without a word, the two sat cross-legged, eager to comprehend their newfound knowledge.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
