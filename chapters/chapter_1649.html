<h1>Chapter 1640: The Switcheroo</h1><p>Amidst the rumbling collapse of the palace, Spirit Weeping Cave Master's screams were particularly piercing, then abruptly ceased. A generation's tyrant had fallen.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man turned ruthless. Just moments ago, he'd spoken of cooperating with Spirit Weeping Cave Master, helping him restore his physical body, and together striving for Deity Transformation. Yet, with the shift in the situation, he annihilated him without hesitation!</p><p>This act severed Qin Sang's possibility of obtaining the Heavenly Exquisite Secret Art through other means.</p><p>If he wanted the secret art, he must first agree to his conditions!</p><p>Responding to him were the Sun God Bird and the vicious beast, the Horned Serpent, attacking in unison, cutting off the Strange-Faced Man's remaining words.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man dodged clumsily, cursing inwardly.</p><p>He couldn't fathom whether Qin Sang possessed absolute confidence in capturing him alive or was merely feigning ruthlessness to lower his bargaining chips. Regardless, he absolutely didn't believe anyone could resist the allure of the Heavenly Exquisite.</p><p>……</p><p>The ice palace collapsed with increasing speed, forming a ring of ice shards that expanded outwards at an incredible pace. The surrounding palaces were leveled by the lingering shockwaves of the flag formation.</p><p>As if echoing the ice palace, the battle in the forest reached its climax.</p><p>It could no longer be called a forest.</p><p>Qin Sang had unleashed a raging inferno, transforming the forest into scorched earth. Only in the center could green light still be seen, but its aura was completely overshadowed by the demonic flames.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ice ring swept over the Qilin screen wall, leaving behind a vast expanse of white ruins.</p><p>The flying ash slowly dispersed, then, impacted by the ice ring, swirled back at an even faster speed.</p><p>Above Ice Instrument Palace, a distinct boundary formed between black and white.</p><p>Within the ice ring, the ethereal blue celestial light continuously bulged, resembling a precious gem embedded in the ground, on the verge of eruption.</p><p>At this moment, only a few intact flag shadows remained within the dark hall, struggling to hold on; the damaged flags had been completely destroyed.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Accompanied by a unified snapping sound, all the precious flags shattered.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The external celestial light exploded!</p><p>A pillar of intensely concentrated blue light, like a sharp arrow, pierced the sky.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The blue light swept across all directions at a speed even greater than the ice ring!</p><p>……</p><p>The stone beach at the entrance of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>More and more puppets were awakening.</p><p>The puppets crowded the stone beach, a dense, dark mass.</p><p>Poison King, Master Huaiyin, and Old Devil Fan broke free from the puppets and rushed out of the stone beach, though their direction differed slightly from Qin Sang's; they emerged from the eastern side.</p><p>Seeing the scene deep within the Formless Immortal Sect, they hesitated, unsure where to go first.</p><p>Emperor Bestowal Mountain was undoubtedly the most prominent. Even if they didn't know its name or origin, they could discern it as the core of the legacy site. However, Emperor Bestowal Mountain was currently calm, devoid of any unusual phenomena.</p><p>When they first entered the Formless Immortal Sect, there was movement from the direction of the cliff, as if someone was vying for something there. But it quickly subsided, and by the time they rushed out of the stone beach, the clifftop had long been silent.</p><p>Other areas occasionally shimmered with strange light, but it was impossible to tell whether it was caused by ongoing battles or fluctuations in the Formless Immortal Sect's restrictions.</p><p>So many experts had entered before them; where had they all gone?</p><p>The Daoist Sect and the Formless Immortal Sect had a deep-seated enmity; surely they wouldn't have reached an agreement to divide the treasures within the legacy site?</p><p>Just as the three were observing, a blue light suddenly shot up from Emperor Bestowal Mountain, so prominent that even the celestial sword formation above couldn't conceal it; it was clearly visible even from the entrance of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Their gazes simultaneously turned towards Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Poison King took the lead.</p><p>Emperor Bestowal Mountain was already a must-see, and now that unusual activity had appeared near it first, there was no need for further consideration.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, a visitor from a foreign land, trusted Poison King's judgment and followed closely behind.</p><p>Old Devil Fan hesitated slightly, his gaze sweeping across the entire legacy site, as if searching for something, before finally choosing to follow.</p><p>……</p><p>Within an unnamed valley.</p><p>The blood net gradually retracted, revealing Su Zinan and a demonic banner.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A faint smile played on Su Zinan's lips as he stretched out his hand, summoning the Three Corpses Death God Banner.</p><p>He caressed the banner's surface with an affectionate touch.</p><p>The banner vibrated continuously in his hand.</p><p>Su Zinan snorted coldly, gripping it tightly. Just as he was about to act, he too was startled by the soaring blue light. With a look of astonishment, he hastily put away the banner and vanished.</p><p>……</p><p>The northern region of the legacy site.</p><p>Located behind the cliff, this area was once one of the forbidden zones of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>It was now impossible to determine what had once existed within the forbidden zone, for it had been reduced to ruins, even more severely damaged than Ice Instrument Palace. An exceptionally fierce battle had undoubtedly taken place here.</p><p>The ruins of the forbidden zone were completely shrouded in darkness.</p><p>Within the pitch-black region, remnants of restrictions drifted everywhere, fraught with danger.</p><p>The darkness, which had existed for untold years, finally welcomed a different kind of light.</p><p>Three streaks of escaping light emerged from the darkness one after another, converging at the edge of the forbidden zone. They were True Person Zi Lei, True Person He Gao, and Yue Lingtian.</p><p>The three had pursued Zhu Wudao, chasing him all the way into the forbidden zone.</p><p>Just now, they had separated to search within the forbidden zone.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist also failed to seize Old Devil Zhu's weakness?"</p><p>Yue Lingtian was inevitably disappointed to see that True Person Zi Lei had returned empty-handed as well.</p><p>It was shameful to admit that three Grand Cultivators, working together, had allowed Old Devil Zhu to escape. Even if the opponent had exploited the terrain to his advantage, it still caused them to lose face.</p><p>True Person He Gao glanced back at the forbidden zone, pondering, "Old Devil Zhu must be hiding within one of the forbidden zone's restrictions. If we search patiently, it won't be difficult to force him out. However, doing so would waste too much time. Zhu Wudao is just one of them; there are numerous experts who have entered the Formless Immortal Sect. If they were to join forces…"</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the blue light soared from Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>True Person He Gao pondered for a moment, then exclaimed in surprise, "It's Ice Instrument Palace! Someone is vying for the Water Phase inheritance."</p><p>He turned to look at True Person Zi Lei.</p><p>There was another reason he hadn't mentioned earlier.</p><p>If they still hadn't gained anything before external forces arrived, their sect leader's plan would end in complete failure.</p><p>From the moment the teleportation formation extinguished, True Person He Gao's thoughts had been in turmoil.</p><p>He dared not dwell on the implications of the severed path to the Immortal Palace.</p><p>As the sect leader's junior brother, he had never needed to worry about the sect's development, enjoying a carefree existence under its protection.</p><p>He had never imagined that the Eight Scenery Pavilion, the leader of the Daoist Sect, would also face such precarious times.</p><p>True Person Zi Lei's expression remained impassive, his gaze as resolute as ever.</p><p>Even the extinguishing of the teleportation formation before his eyes seemed to be within his expectations, causing no ripples in his composure.</p><p>"To Emperor Bestowal Mountain!" True Person Zi Lei made a decisive choice.</p><p>Shortly after the three departed, the shadows at the edge of the forbidden zone flickered, revealing a blurry figure. It glanced towards Emperor Bestowal Mountain, let out a few cold laughs, and vanished.</p><p>Emperor Bestowal Mountain was in sight.</p><p>The three didn't head directly towards it, but deviated slightly, intending to take a detour to Ice Instrument Palace to see what had transpired.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after flying for a while, Yue Lingtian suddenly stopped.</p><p>The two True Persons noticed his action and also slowed down, looking over at him.</p><p>Yue Lingtian gazed towards the east of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, where the mountains undulated, the scenery indistinct. He asked in a deep voice, "I recall Fellow Daoist mentioning that the Earth Phase Hall is located east of Emperor Bestowal Mountain."</p><p>"Indeed, the Metal Phase Hall lies between Emperor Bestowal Mountain and the Earth Phase Hall. Heading directly east, past a large river, one arrives there. Each lineage has prominent markers. It's said that the Earth Phase Hall occupies the largest area among the five lineages…"</p><p>True Person He Gao replied, then realized something, asking in surprise, "Sect Master Yue, you…"</p><p>Yue Lingtian cupped his hands towards the two, "Now that the path to the Immortal Palace is severed, and the Grand Elder is blocked outside the legacy site, the Formless Immortal Sect's inheritance is limited, while contenders are numerous. As Sect Master, I bear the responsibility of revitalizing the sect; the Earth Phase Hall's opportunity cannot be missed. Once I obtain the Earth Phase inheritance, I will rush to Emperor Bestowal Mountain and meet with the two Fellow Daoists."</p><p>With that, without giving them a chance to persuade him, Yue Lingtian's escaping light shifted, transforming into a streak of profound yellow light, shooting towards the Earth Phase Hall, seemingly indifferent to Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>True Person He Gao opened his mouth, finding himself unable to utter any words of dissuasion.</p><p>Although Yue Lingtian hadn't explicitly stated it, it was evident that he harbored resentment towards the Eight Scenery Pavilion.</p><p>After all, Yue Lingtian had gambled his entire sect, cooperating with the Eight Scenery Pavilion to perform this play, only to have the path to the Immortal Palace severed, rendering the Eight Scenery Pavilion's promises empty.</p><p>If it were any other sect, Yue Lingtian might have turned hostile on the spot.</p><p>Anyone would suspect the Eight Scenery Pavilion's motives. It was already quite remarkable that Yue Lingtian had suppressed his dissatisfaction and hadn't directly rebuked them.</p><p>It was understandable that he would withdraw under the pretense of seeking the Earth Phase inheritance to observe the situation.</p><p>The Eight Scenery Pavilion was already preoccupied with its own affairs; True Person He Gao didn't know how to appease Yue Lingtian.</p><p>After a moment of silence, True Person Zi Lei let out a barely audible sigh.</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>……</p><p>Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>Heaven and earth were dyed a brilliant blue by the ethereal blue celestial light.</p><p>The residual waves spread with astonishing speed, engulfing the battlefield in the blink of an eye.</p><p>After a fierce struggle, the Strange-Faced Man had become extremely disheveled.</p><p>Multiple parts of his body were scorched black, his severed left arm yet to regenerate. The space for him to maneuver was constantly being compressed by the demonic flames, revealing clear signs of defeat.</p><p>At the moment the ethereal blue celestial light erupted, the earth-shattering impact and dazzling blue light caused Qin Sang to instinctively squint, his mind seemingly shaken, experiencing a brief moment of distraction.</p><p>In that instant, the cornered Strange-Faced Man suddenly ceased resisting, stopping his glib persuasion, and eerily froze in place.</p><p>He had been waiting for this opportunity.</p><p>Deity Transformation opportunity, Heavenly Exquisite, all were just delays.</p><p>Of course, if Qin Sang had shown interest, he wouldn't have minded making a deal.</p><p>He had been waiting for the moment the grand formation was destroyed!</p><p>A 'cackling' sound emanated from his throat, a harsh, grating sound, as if he were laughing maniacally. From his scarred torso, a rich green light erupted.</p><p>The green light seeped out from the cracks in his bark-like skin, resembling countless green light blades, slicing his entire body into countless fragments of varying sizes.</p><p>His emerald eyes stared fixedly at Qin Sang, his pupils deeply reflecting his figure.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man wanted to etch Qin Sang into his memory.</p><p>He had been forced into this situation, all thanks to Qin Sang. He didn't yet know that Qin Sang and the transformed body were one and the same; it was the transformed body he hated most.</p><p>The green light intensified to its peak.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man's Spiritwood body exploded almost simultaneously with the ethereal blue celestial light.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Countless wooden fragments shot out.</p><p>Each fragment was enveloped in a团 of green light.</p><p>All the green lights emitted the same fluctuation, dispersing into the starry sky.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted.  The Strange-Faced Man had been waiting for an opportunity to escape, and he, too, had been waiting.</p><p>The Horned Serpent lashed its tail, spewing icy flames, easily annihilating swathes of fragments. The Sun God Bird swooped down, joining forces with the Nine Nether Demonic Flames to obliterate countless more, but none contained the Strange-Faced Man!</p><p>However, at the same instant the Strange-Faced Man self-destructed, Qin Sang unleashed his divine sense and Heavenly Eye divine ability without reservation, simultaneously channeling true essence into his palm, infusing it into the down feather.</p><p>His long-planned move finally unfolded!</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The power of the Myriad Venom Mountain treasure within the down feather was activated, instantly turning to white ash.</p><p>At the same time, the Goldfall Sword moved according to his will, abruptly thrusting towards an empty space.</p><p>An extremely minute point of light was escaping towards that location; this was clearly where the essence of the Spiritwood body resided.</p><p>Although the Strange-Faced Man used countless fragments as a cover and fully suppressed his aura fluctuations, it was impossible to hide from the Heavenly Eye. Qin Sang's divine sense simultaneously locked onto the point of light, sensing the fluctuations of a nascent soul within.</p><p>Just as it was about to pierce the point of light, the Goldfall Sword transformed into a sword formation once more. Stripped of his physical body, the Strange-Faced Man faced the direct impact of the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, and, barring any unforeseen circumstances, would be captured alive.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>The sword formation appeared, and a scream erupted!</p><p>Unexpectedly, the scream came from elsewhere.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang discovered to his surprise that the nascent soul aura within the point of light wasn't that of the Strange-Faced Man, but Spirit Weeping Cave Master's!</p><p>Having killed Spirit Weeping Cave Master in front of Qin Sang and feigning resolve, he had actually kept a hidden hand. He decisively abandoned the essence of his Spiritwood body, infusing it with Spirit Weeping Cave Master's remnant soul to mislead Qin Sang's judgment, employing a switcheroo tactic.</p><p>But he hadn't anticipated that Qin Sang wasn't relying solely on divine sense; the Heavenly Eye Butterfly instantly locked onto the essence's location.</p><p>He also hadn't anticipated that Qin Sang possessed a treasure gifted by Myriad Venom Mountain.</p><p>The power of the Myriad Venom Mountain treasure was triggered.</p><p>The residual poison within the Strange-Faced Man erupted.</p><p>Over the years, he had gradually sealed the residual poison within his body, and the scars on his face had faded considerably. At his peak, it wouldn't have been a major issue, but now he was powerless to suppress it any longer!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with a sharp glint as he raised a hand and pointed.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A bolt of heavenly lightning struck down, blasting a deep pit into the ground. A blood-colored shadow flickered within the pit.</p><p>Qin Sang muttered "cunning."</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man had actually attached his nascent soul to the Gu King, using the Gu King's ability to flicker within the point of light to draw it underground, employing a technique similar to earth遁 to escape the fire ring's range.</p><p>The Gu King's backlash was real.</p><p>But the Gu King was personally nurtured by him and had already reached maturity; it wasn't necessarily as serious as the Strange-Faced Man had made it seem.</p><p>If not for the down feather's contribution, Qin Sang would have quickly discovered the deception, but completely eliminating the threat would likely have required more effort.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man's nascent soul also bore centipede-like scars on its face, a sign of the virulent poison's invasion.</p><p>With the residual poison erupting and being struck by lightning, the nascent soul suffered severe damage. Seeing the Nine Nether Demonic Flames that Qin Sang subsequently summoned, its face was filled with pain and terror as it desperately attempted to execute a teleportation technique.</p><p>At that moment, the Gu King stared intently at the Strange-Faced Man's nascent soul, the ferocious glint in its eyes intensifying. Suddenly, it emitted a sharp shriek and spewed a mouthful of venomous light onto the nascent soul!</p><p>The teleportation technique was disrupted.</p><p>The nascent soul snapped back to its senses, seeing the Gu King at close range, its face filled with astonishment.</p><p>The next moment, a heart-wrenching scream resounded.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared above the deep pit in a flash. Witnessing the gruesome scene, he couldn't help but gasp.</p><p>He hadn't expected the Blood Armored Beetle to be so ferocious. The moment the restrictions on it weakened, it unhesitatingly turned on its master. Qin Sang had no time to intervene.</p><p>The Gu King's poison was incredibly potent.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man's nascent soul, repeatedly battered and lacking any protection, was struck by the venomous light. Its spiritual light dimmed, on the verge of death.</p><p>With swift reflexes, Qin Sang scooped up the interspatial pouch that tumbled out of the nascent soul's fading light, then waved a hand, summoning demonic flames to suppress the Blood Armored Beetle, attempting to save the Strange-Faced Man.</p>
