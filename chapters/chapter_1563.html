<h1>Chapter 1554: The Gu God Cult</h1><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A biting wind howled, accompanied by a torrential blizzard.  Snowflakes were as large as mats.</p><p>The world was a monochrome expanse of white.</p><p>A region of extreme cold formed around the Snow-Treading Divine Blade, rapidly freezing the sea's surface into a massive ice sheet.  These weren't ordinary snowflakes; they were solidified sword intent, incredibly sharp.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Blade appeared where the Sea-巡海夜叉 had vanished, its tip pointing downwards towards the seabed, its intent unleashed.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Countless snowflakes pierced the ice sheet.  The ice was riddled with holes, but the cold was even more intense, spreading rapidly downwards and outwards. At this rate, a vast area of the sea would be frozen solid.</p><p>Beneath the sea,</p><p>the Sea-巡海夜叉 rode a blue shark, darting through the water with incredible agility, unimpeded.  Sensing the change in energy above, the Sea-巡海夜叉 raised its head to see a blinding white expanse, as if the heavens were collapsing.  A ferocious expression crossed its eyes.</p><p>The Sea-巡海夜叉's aura merged with that of the blue shark, their speed pushed to the limit.  The Sea-巡海夜叉’s legs clamped down on the shark, which showed pain but couldn't control its own body.</p><p>At the same time, the Sea-巡海夜叉's expression froze momentarily, then became agile again.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Blade hummed.  The blade trembled violently, shooting out a dazzling beam of light, a white streak across the sky, like a white rainbow piercing the sun.</p><p>It was midday, yet even the sun's light seemed cold.</p><p>Zhou Jin and the others, fleeing on their flying artifacts, sensed something and turned to see the astonishing sight, their faces filled with shock.</p><p>The divine blade struck!</p><p>The ice sheet shattered, countless ice shards swept up by the Snow-Treading Divine Blade, tearing through the sea, leaving a massive trench. The seawater couldn't close in time; instead, it was impacted by the blizzard of ice shards, forming mountainous waves on either side.  These waves froze at their peak, becoming two icebergs.</p><p>The icebergs snaked like dragons.  Nestled between them, the trench seemed bottomless, highlighting the blade's immense power.</p><p>Within the trench, the Sea-巡海夜叉 and blue shark were revealed.  Even before the blade arrived, the chilling sword intent enveloped them, sealing the surrounding space as ice spread across their bodies.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Sea-巡海夜叉 made no attempt to counterattack, allowing itself to be frozen.</p><p>In an instant, an ice sculpture formed. The Sea-巡海夜叉’s expression suddenly became rigid, then its figure disappeared, revealing it to be an illusion. Only the blue shark remained frozen.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered above, observing without emotion.  He changed his hand seals, reversing the Snow-Treading Divine Blade, swinging it past the blue shark and towards the depths of the trench.</p><p>At that moment,</p><p>a roar echoed from the trench. The roar reverberated between the ice walls, spiraling and amplifying until it shook the heavens and earth. Zhou Jin and the others heard it clearly, and were terrified.</p><p>The roar came from a blue shark. This shark looked no different from others, but its size was colossal, ten times larger than the frozen shark, comparable to a whale.</p><p>The enormous blue shark half-turned, glaring at Qin Sang. It swung its tail, its scales opening and closing.  Using its powerful body and brute strength, it slammed into the Snow-Treading Divine Blade.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The shockwave shattered the ice walls, and seawater poured in.  The Snow-Treading Divine Blade was initially impeded, but ultimately broke through the shark's scales and split its skull.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared above, glancing around with a hint of regret.  He murmured, "What excellent illusion and water escape techniques!  It's a pity I didn't bring the Sky-Eyed Butterfly."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the blue shark's remains dissipated, turning into two pools of seawater.  The Sea-巡海夜叉 had vanished.</p><p>The ocean was its home turf.  The Sea-巡海夜叉 was extremely cautious, maintaining a distance from the battlefield and fleeing when the situation turned unfavorable.  Qin Sang had to be wary of ambushes; even if he had used the Four-Rank Serpent Seal, it likely wouldn't have yielded much.</p><p>He released his spiritual sense, but couldn't detect the Sea-巡海夜叉's aura. He sheathed the Snow-Treading Divine Blade, flashed out of the trench, and located the ice sculpture that had been thrown clear by the shockwave.</p><p>He had carefully controlled his strength; the blue shark was still alive, its belly up, floating on the sea's surface.  Its eyes darted around wildly as it struggled violently, but it couldn't break free from the ice prison.  Seeing Qin Sang approach, it looked terrified.</p><p>"I know you're intelligent!"</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the ice, "Answer my questions!"</p><p>The blue shark nodded repeatedly, its head banging against the ice, making a *bang-bang* sound.</p><p>"Are you aquatic cultivators who have been practicing here, or did you wander here from elsewhere? Where is your lair? Why are you here? How many other demon kings are nearby?" Qin Sang stared intently into the blue shark's eyes.</p><p>The blue shark didn't hesitate.  It opened its bloody maw, revealing rows of sharp teeth, but its voice was as thin as a mosquito's whine, timidly saying, "My lord, I have been cultivating in the deep sea with my king. We have never harmed humans.  Not long ago, the king suddenly led his army here and attacked the treasure ship; it was his order. Please, my lord, understand. I am merely his mount and have little knowledge; I don't know the king's intentions.  The king only mentioned that other kings would follow..."</p><p>"My lord?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, a knowing smile playing on his lips. Ignoring the blue shark's pleading gaze, he fell into thought.</p><p>He then asked more questions; the blue shark answered everything it knew but couldn't provide the information Qin Sang sought.</p><p>The sea-patrol yaksha had indeed just arrived.</p><p>Demon kings were rushing to the Chi Nan Islands. Was there a secret there, a secret even the demons knew about?</p><p>This place was no longer safe.</p><p>Qin Sang exerted slight pressure on his foot, shattering the ice.</p><p>The blue shark, now free, but without orders dared not leave; it trembled, clinging to Qin Sang's feet.</p><p>Qin Sang hopped onto the shark's back, pointing towards the Chi Nan Islands, "Let's go!"</p><p>The blue shark didn't utter a sound, parting the water and breaking the waves.  Soon they caught up with Zhou Jin and the others.  With Qin Sang's permission, everyone rode the shark back.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang remained silent; the others dared not speak.</p><p>In silence, they encountered no beasts and returned to the Chi Nan Islands safely.</p><p>"Disperse."</p><p>Stepping onto land, Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Leng Qi and the others finally had a chance to express their gratitude, bowing to Qin Sang before departing, each with their own thoughts.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and saw the blue shark by the shore, its head poking out, gazing longingly at him.</p><p>He picked up a clump of earth, fashioned it into a crude bowl, conjured water, and said to the blue shark, "Get in."</p><p>The blue shark was stunned, staring blankly at the ugly bowl. It was reluctant, but dared not disobey, shrinking its size.</p><p>In the palm-sized bowl, the blue shark looked like a small fish, swimming inside.</p><p>Qin Sang handed the bowl to Zhou Jin, "Take it back to the inn and keep it in the pond in the backyard."</p><p>Zhou Jin, unlike Qin Sang, didn't treat the matter lightly. This blue shark was stronger than him; he carefully accepted the bowl with both hands, afraid of spilling it, and followed Qin Sang closely.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled back to the inn and shut himself in.</p><p>On the day of their landing, news of the great demon's appearance spread like wildfire across the Chi Nan Islands, fueling public panic, especially with the stormy weather.</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>The wind howled; rain lashed down.</p><p>A figure appeared before the small courtyard Qin Sang rented.</p><p>The protective barrier was triggered.</p><p>Inside the house, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly.  "Faster than expected!"</p><p>"Open the gate and welcome our guest!"</p><p>Qin Sang sent a voice transmission to the Zhou and Ruan couple.</p><p>They were watching the blue shark by the pond.  Exchanging surprised glances, they sensed no one outside the courtyard.</p><p>They hastily deactivated the barrier, opened the gate, and saw an elderly man standing outside, his expression solemn.  They bowed respectfully, "Please, elder."</p><p>The elder was simply dressed in coarse linen, but his bearing was extraordinary.</p><p>He nodded slightly, following Zhou Jin to the main hall. He paused, stroking his long beard, and sized up Ruan Yu, who was standing at the door.</p><p>Ruan Yu blushed, her heart pounding under the elder's gaze.</p><p>Zhou Jin was furious but dared not show it.</p><p>"Excellent!  Exceptional talent. It's a pity your vital energy was damaged; otherwise, you would have a great chance of forming a golden core. I have a Chao Yuan Pill here, which might be beneficial to you."</p><p>The elder produced a jade bottle containing a pill.</p><p>The Zhou and Ruan couple were astonished.</p><p>Ruan Yu was flustered, unsure how to respond, and even more hesitant to accept the gift.</p><p>"Ruan Yu, thank the elder for his kindness,"</p><p>Qin Sang's voice came from inside.</p><p>Ruan Yu's face lit up.  She took the bottle and performed a deep bow, "Thank you, elder, for the pill."</p><p>"My surname is Leng."</p><p>An elderly man, smiling amiably, turned and entered the main hall.  He announced loudly, "Cold You, Left Protector of the Gu God Cult, has come unannounced. I hope I haven't disturbed Daoist Qin's cultivation?"</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his private chamber. "Daoist Cold, you've brought a grand gift upon your arrival. I'm most grateful."</p><p>With a gesture, Qin Sang invited the elder to sit.  "The Three Cold Disciples are...?" he asked curiously.</p><p>The elder nodded. "Indeed, they are my three rather inept disciples.  Their previous lack of manners, I hope, you will forgive, Daoist Qin. Compared to saving their lives from the beast, a mere Chao Yuan Pill is nothing."</p><p>Qin Sang understood. "So you've come at your disciples' request? Your speed is remarkable!" His tone held a hint of mockery.</p><p>Qin Sang keenly sensed something. The elder must have been lurking near the Southern Archipelago. Whether for other reasons or with malicious intent, only time would tell.</p><p>The disappearance of the Transcendent cultivator was significant, yet it didn't greatly affect most factions.</p><p>The legendary ruins of the ancient Immortal Sect remained just that – legends.</p><p>Yuan Ying cultivators were all busy cultivating and overcoming their tribulations. Sending a few promising disciples to investigate in the East Sea was already a sign of great importance.  They would only personally intervene after obtaining definite clues.</p><p>If it weren't for the two Immortal Palaces, Qin Sang wouldn't have acted personally, and even then, it was only his avatar.</p><p>The Demon King.</p><p>Hidden Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang felt a storm brewing, himself at the center of the vortex. Whether it was good or bad, he couldn't tell.</p><p>The elder didn't seem to notice the sarcasm. His smile remained unchanged. "Hearing Cold Qi's description of your astounding abilities, I feel utterly humbled. I consider myself well-informed, yet I was unaware of a master such as yourself!  My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>"Your disciple likely exaggerated,"</p><p>Qin Sang responded calmly, neither happy nor sad.  "Besides, the world is vast, and heroes abound.  One cannot possibly know them all. Daoist Cold, please don't mind, I've never heard of the Gu God Cult before."</p><p>Hearing the elder's claim, Qin Sang's mind raced, recalling various factions. He'd painstakingly gathered information to familiarize himself with the Central Plains cultivation world, but the Gu God Cult wasn't among them.</p><p>The elder was a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator, yet only a Protector in the Gu God Cult.  This suggested the existence of other Protectors and a higher-ranking leader.</p><p>How could such a powerful faction be unknown?</p><p>A hidden force, perhaps emerging only after the Transcendent cultivator's disappearance?</p><p>The name 'Gu God Cult' itself triggered Qin Sang's suspicion.</p><p>He recalled the Cold disciples' techniques during the beast attack. After their ship shattered, the three worked together, opening pouches to release colorful powders and liquids – potent poisons.</p><p>The colors were chaotic, yet followed a peculiar pattern, creating a vibrant poisonous field.  Beasts that approached either died in spasms or dissolved into pus.  Even robust bodies couldn't withstand it. It was incredibly vicious.</p><p>Cold Qi was particularly skilled at poison attacks. He opened his mouth, revealing a purple-scaled snake head that spewed poisonous smoke, amplifying the field's power.</p><p>Others kept their distance, clearly fearing the three disciples.</p><p>"This isn't the same 'gu'… it's a type of Gu poison technique! That snake isn't a spirit insect, but a cultivated venomous beast. It's not the witch tribe's insect Gu; it seems unrelated…"</p><p>Qin Sang had a good grasp of their background.</p><p>What abilities did this old poisoner possess?</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was undoubtedly their nemesis.</p><p>His avatar, being a spirit wood body, wasn't afraid of ordinary poisons, but many toxins could harm the primordial spirit, disrupting or even stagnating true essence, demanding caution.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke frankly.</p><p>The elder wasn't offended, smiling amiably. "We didn't meet earlier; it was a lack of fate."</p><p>He produced an iron token and offered it to Qin Sang.  The front read 'Gu God,' while the back depicted a strange crown.  Five jade pieces of different colors adorned the crown's edge, their meaning unclear.</p><p>"What's the meaning of this?" Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>"I've only given out two Gu God tokens, to those with whom I strongly connect. Although we've just met, I admire your chivalry and your rescue of my disciples. Rest assured, the token holds no obligations, only signifying a distinguished status. You'll be hearing much about my cult. If you encounter trouble, we'll offer full support!"</p><p>The elder spoke with utmost confidence.</p><p>Qin Sang, naturally skeptical of such generosity, decided to accept the token to understand the Gu God Cult's true nature.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang take it, the elder's smile widened.</p><p>After pleasantries, the elder finally revealed his purpose, inquiring about Qin Sang's findings regarding the Demon King's pursuit.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this and didn't hide anything. He had Zhou Ruan guide the elder to the backyard pond to question the Blue Shark personally.</p>
