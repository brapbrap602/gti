<h1>Chapter 1555: Observing the Shifting Winds</h1><p>Elder Leng's visit was only the beginning.</p><p>In the following period, more Nascent Soul cultivators arrived one after another.  Regardless of their background, Qin Sang only met them briefly, then retreated under the pretext of healing, instructing the Zhou-阮 couple to escort them directly to the back courtyard to interrogate the Blue Flood Dragon.  Some even wanted to buy the dragon.</p><p>Having to receive several Nascent Soul cultivators in succession, the Zhou-阮 couple, who had never witnessed such a scene, were initially terrified, but later managed to compose themselves.</p><p>One day, as the Zhou-阮 couple were guarding the main hall, betting on whether any more Nascent Soul cultivators would arrive, the door to the quiet chamber suddenly opened.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged, looked at the hastily rising couple, and instructed, "Pack your things. We're leaving the Scarlet South Archipelago."</p><p>Zhou Jin was stunned.  "Senior Qin, are only the three of us going to the outer sea?"</p><p>They had been closely monitoring the situation on the islands.  Ever since news of the Great妖’s appearance spread, everyone in the Scarlet South Archipelago was on edge, maintaining strict vigilance. Low-level cultivators no longer dared to venture into the outer sea.</p><p>Now, the Scarlet South Archipelago had become a gathering point for various forces. It was rumored that the Nascent Soul Grandmasters, with their mysterious movements, were discussing some sort of plan.  These past few days, Qin Sang had claimed to be injured by the transformed Great妖 and remained secluded, seemingly unwilling to ally with any of the current forces on the islands.  Zhou Jin assumed Qin Sang had other allies, but so far, not a single one had appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  "Not the outer sea. We're going back!"</p><p>"Going back now?  What about the ancient Immortal Sect's ruins…?"</p><p>Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu were astonished, completely unexpected by this decision. The Scarlet South Archipelago was in turmoil, with powerful figures from both races arriving one after another, clearly indicating that something major was about to happen.  The legend was likely true. Senior Qin was fully qualified to claim a share, yet he intended to withdraw now.</p><p>"What Immortal Sect? Is there a Divine Transformation opportunity?"  Qin Sang scoffed, his hands clasped behind his back as he walked towards the back courtyard, leaving the dumbfounded Zhou-阮 couple behind.</p><p>First, it was the Demon King's appearance.  Upon returning to the Scarlet South Archipelago, Elder Leng visited late at night, further implicating a mysterious Gu God Sect. At that point, Qin Sang had sensed something amiss, suspecting that the matter was not as simple as the so-called ancient Immortal Sect. He even suspected that the legend had been intentionally spread. He had stumbled into this situation by chance.</p><p>During this period, the Scarlet South Archipelago was a mix of various factions, with undercurrents surging beneath the surface. Qin Sang had openly placed the Blue Flood Dragon in the pond, intending to use the news of the Demon King to lure out the hidden players, yet he still couldn't unravel the intricate web or see through the underlying scheme.</p><p>He had no desire to be a pawn in someone else's game, nor would he allow himself to be dragged into a dangerous whirlpool.  Since he couldn't see through it, he would simply step away!</p><p>His true body was getting closer and closer to a breakthrough. Inaction was preferable to action. Even if there were ruins of an ancient Immortal Sect nearby, the likelihood of a Divine Transformation opportunity existing within was extremely low, not to mention that the legend remained unconfirmed.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang wouldn't stray too far for the time being.  He planned to find a place to settle down and observe the shifting winds. He would wait until the situation in the Scarlet South Archipelago became clearer or until he received definitive news, and then decide whether to contact his true body or compete for the opportunity. He would act according to the circumstances.</p><p>The Zhou-阮 couple, unable to grasp the subtle nuances, could only obey, quickly packing their belongings and following Qin Sang to the back courtyard.</p><p>In the pond, the Blue Flood Dragon, shrunk to the size of a carp, floated belly-up, motionless and listless, like a dead fish.  Qin Sang's use of it to entertain the Nascent Soul cultivators had left it utterly devastated, barely clinging to life, both its mind and body deeply traumatized.</p><p>Finally seeing Qin Sang, a glimmer of life returned to the dragon's dull eyes.  It struggled to turn over and, mustering its remaining strength, swam to the shore, crying pitifully, "Master, spare me! Master, spare me!"</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the edge of the pond, looked down at the Blue Flood Dragon, and gestured to Zhou Jin.  "Are you willing to acknowledge him as your master?"</p><p>Had it been Qin Sang, the Blue Flood Dragon wouldn't have hesitated.  But this person…  The dragon sighed.  The situation dictated its actions.  It could only nod in agreement.</p><p>Qin Sang said to Zhou Jin, "Take it back and make it the guardian spirit beast of the Tower Terrace View."</p><p>Zhou Jin never imagined that their gains this time would be so significant.  Ruan Yu received an elixir from Elder Leng, and he gained a Core Formation stage spirit beast.  It was truly beneficial to be under the shade of a large tree!  Running errands for Senior Qin certainly brought good fortune.</p><p>Zhou Jin gleefully subdued the Blue Flood Dragon, promising, "Fellow Daoist Blue Flood Dragon, from now on, we are equals. If you can transform, the Tower Terrace View will grant you your freedom."</p><p>This brought some comfort to the Blue Flood Dragon's heart.</p><p>After settling their bills, they left the market, traveled to the western shore of the Scarlet South Archipelago, summoned their flying treasures, and soared through the sky.</p><p>...</p><p>Within the market, in a secluded courtyard, the finest location in the entire market, with its elegant pavilions and tranquil atmosphere, the door creaked open. Leng Qi hurried in, head slightly bowed, demeanor respectful, and walked briskly to the main hall. "Master, Senior Qin and the Zhou-阮 couple have left the market. It's said they headed west."</p><p>Inside the hall, Elder Leng was playing a game of Go with another person.</p><p>*Clack!*</p><p>Elder Leng placed a white stone.</p><p>The other person was completely shrouded in a black robe, even their face concealed.  Holding a black stone, their hand was as delicate as a youth's, but their voice sounded ancient and faint.  "Since they have left, perhaps they were merely passing through, not one of us."</p><p>Elder Leng gazed at the board, pondered for a moment, and shook his head slightly. "He's a clever one, perhaps not impossible to recruit...  Very well, the time is not yet ripe. There's no rush."</p><p>The black-robed figure hummed in agreement. "Those who arrived first are clearly the most concerned about the Divine Transformation cultivator's disappearance. We must carefully discern who are our enemies and who are our friends."</p><p>Elder Leng fingered a stone, hesitant. "The Eight Scenery Sect and the Sweet Dew Monastery haven't made any moves. If a Divine Transformation cultivator has disappeared, they should be the most concerned."</p><p>The black-robed figure chuckled strangely.  "The leaders of the Buddhist and Daoist sects tend to have some composure! The demon race's movements are quite interesting.  The Demon King's swift appearance is an unexpected gain. The Divine Transformation cultivator's disappearance seems to not be an isolated incident. If we can confirm that the demon race's Holy King has also disappeared, it will be quite telling.  Come to think of it, how many years has it been since there's been any news of that old monster in the Northern Wilderness' Deer Fields?  The world has already forgotten him. Unfortunately, the Deer Fields have withdrawn from the world, their location elusive, and no Deer Fields descendant has appeared!  Even if those old fellows can return, as long as we seize this opportunity, it will be enough for us to act..."</p><p>Elder Leng nodded.</p><p>The two fell silent, the only sound in the hall being the crisp clicks of stones against the board.  Leng Qi waited outside for a while, then silently withdrew.</p><p>...</p><p>Out at sea, the sun shone brightly, the surface calm and waveless. Suddenly, ripples appeared, a white line streaking across the horizon at an astonishing speed. It was a handsome young man clad in ornate jade armor.  A pair of white wings, like a crane feather cloak, unfolded from his back, flapping gently, propelling him forward with incredible speed until he vanished in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Reaching an unfamiliar area of the sea, the young man circled briefly, then folded his wings and parted the water, descending to the seabed.  Soon, he spotted a crystal palace suspended in the ocean.</p><p>Several Blue Flood Dragons swam around the crystal palace. Seeing the young man, they were initially wary, then prostrated themselves, trembling.</p><p>The young man flew directly to the palace gate and slapped it hard, a mischievous grin on his face.  "Old Fishy, heard you ran into a tough one and suffered a setback?"</p><p>An annoyed grunt echoed from within. The gate silently opened, and the young man entered, seeing the sullen Sea Nightcrawler. He laughed even harder.  "I warned you not to be so arrogant.  Did you really think the human race had no one who could control you?  If you get caught and made into a guardian spirit beast, no one can save you."</p><p>"You featherless crane!  Did you come just to mock me?"</p><p>The Sea Nightcrawler raged, "I merely saw that the ship had many delicious Golden Core cultivators, a truly tempting sight, and acted on a whim. Who could have anticipated a Nascent Soul cultivator hiding in the shadows! You tricked me into coming here for that damned ancient Immortal Sect? A human race ruin, what treasures could it possibly hold?"</p><p>The young man stopped laughing, his gaze flickering.  "Old Fishy, think carefully.  An ancient Immortal Sect built in this location, could it lack opportunities to interact with our race?  It's said that back then, our race was oppressed, countless ancestors enslaved by the Immortal Palace. How could the ruins be lacking in treasures? This time, fellow Daoists from the Holy King's Palace will also be present. Don't say I didn't warn you, restrain your temper, and don't ruin this important matter."</p><p>"The Holy King's Palace?"</p><p>The Sea Nightcrawler was both surprised and delighted. "An order from the Holy King?"</p><p>The young man shook his head, offering no answer.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang left the Scarlet South Archipelago, stepping outside the circle. He traveled westward with the Zhou-阮 couple, and when he felt they had gone far enough, they stopped at an island with a market town.</p><p>Qin Sang remained secluded, while the Zhou-阮 couple ventured out, responsible for gathering information. It might not be the most timely, but it allowed for contemplation.</p><p>The Scarlet South Archipelago first saw the legend of the ancient Immortal Sect, followed by the Demon King's appearance. These signs hinted at something extraordinary, gradually fermenting with time.  As the news spread, Nascent Soul cultivators frequently appeared in the Scarlet South Archipelago.  In the outer sea, the demon race's activities also increased, even resulting in beast tides.</p><p>Initially, both sides exercised restraint, tacitly maintaining a distance, searching their respective territories repeatedly.  Later, with neither side finding anything, they could only expand their search, inevitably encroaching on each other's territory, leading to increasing friction. Every so often, news would arrive of battles between Nascent Soul cultivators and Demon Kings.</p><p>During this time, someone unearthed ancient texts from who knew how many years ago, confirming that a super-power known as the Unfettered Hall had indeed existed near the Scarlet South Archipelago, further igniting enthusiasm.</p><p>This chaotic situation persisted for a long time, yet yielded no results. The waters around the Scarlet South Archipelago were thoroughly searched countless times, but where were the ruins of this ancient Immortal Sect?  As enthusiasm waned, the grand treasure hunt came to an abrupt end, the scheming and maneuvering in between seeming somewhat ridiculous and pointless.</p><p>Fortunately, the leaders of both races remained level-headed, preventing the unsubstantiated rumors from escalating into large-scale conflict, averting widespread carnage.</p><p>Observing this, Qin Sang felt as if he had witnessed a farce, baffling and confusing to onlookers.  There was no trace of the imagined mastermind, as if it were merely a simple treasure hunt.  Upon learning about the Unfettered Hall, he even briefly considered having his true body emerge.</p><p>After the farce, it was difficult for the Scarlet South Archipelago to return to its former tranquility. The Unfettered Hall had indeed existed. Some cultivators lingered, while others continued to arrive, each believing themselves blessed with destiny, capable of finding the Unfettered Hall's ruins.</p><p>Confirming that the various forces were withdrawing and the beast tides becoming increasingly rare, with most of the demon race returning to the deep sea, Qin Sang decided it was unnecessary to stay any longer.</p><p>He kept the names of the Gu God Sect and Elder Leng in mind. Perhaps the ripples caused by this treasure hunt would only manifest much later, revealing the underlying connections.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was preparing to return to Fudù Prefecture, the Zhou-阮 couple brought back an unexpected guest.</p><p>Inside the quiet chamber, white qi swirled above Qin Sang's head, suspended like a cloud of mystic energy, as he cultivated the *Myriad Heaven One Qi Grand Capture Hand*.  The mystic energy condensed and dispersed, transforming into various shapes.  With each transformation, imperceptible tremors rippled through the surrounding void, all under his control.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang remained detached, continuing his cultivation without interruption, making daily progress.</p><p>Sensing the commotion outside, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. The mystic energy cloud above his head vibrated, then abruptly retracted, the energy flowing into his body through his crown, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke, a flicker of surprise in his eyes, and pushed the door open.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu!"</p><p>It was none other than Lu Zhang of the Unwavering Mountain, returning with the Zhou-阮 couple.</p><p>Lu Zhang nodded, teasing, "I heard that a mysterious expert proficient in ice divine abilities appeared in the Scarlet South Archipelago at the very beginning, repelling the Demon King with a single strike. I wondered if it might be you. Those skilled in such divine abilities are not common in the Central Continent.  Later, I indeed encountered the Zhou-阮 couple... Why are you using Fellow Daoist Qin's name? Aren't you afraid he'll come looking for you?"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed as well.  "After befriending Fellow Daoist Qin, I often impersonate him to confuse others.  I never imagined I would reunite with Fellow Daoist Lu here. Please, have a seat."</p><p>Lu Zhang, completely unaware that they were one and the same, nodded and sat down.  "I came to the East Sea on behalf of my sect for another matter.  After completing it, I heard about the ancient Immortal Sect appearing in the Scarlet South Archipelago and came on a whim to join the excitement.  Only after arriving did I realize something was amiss, shrouded in mystery. Fellow Daoist, first using an alias, then withdrawing, you must have sensed something as well, right?"</p><p>"Indeed."</p><p>Qin Sang needed someone to help him unravel the mysteries. He recounted his recent experiences and asked gravely,  "Fellow Daoist Lu, do you also believe there are hidden motives behind this?"</p><p>Lu Zhang nodded. "Knowing you were also here, I was worried you'd be unwittingly dragged into it.  Fortunately, you withdrew. Otherwise, you would surely face endless trouble later.  The Eight Scenery Sect and the Sweet Dew Monastery appear inactive, but no one knows their true intentions.  On the surface, those gathered in the Scarlet South Archipelago are all treasure seekers drawn by the Unfettered Hall. However, among them are some forces that have always lurked in the shadows, now acting uncharacteristically.  Some are even unheard of by me, yet their strength is not to be underestimated."</p><p>Qin Sang added, "Such as the Gu God Sect?"</p><p>Lu Zhang agreed.  "Calling themselves a 'Sect,' yet unseen in their missionary work, isn't that strange?  Perhaps the Gu God Sect only operates in remote areas, their methods secretive and low-key, avoiding attention.  However, as long as they emerge, they will inevitably leave traces.  I'll send someone to investigate after returning to the sect."</p><p>The two exchanged their findings.  Information was scarce, making it impossible to draw conclusions.</p><p>Lu Zhang cupped his hands and changed the subject.  "Fellow Daoist, I came here with a request for your assistance."</p>
