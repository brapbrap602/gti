<h1>Chapter 1713: Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound</h1><p>After reaching Deity Transformation, Qin Sang hadn't focused on cultivation, nor had he carefully examined the changes after his breakthrough. He had been searching for the source of the demonic sound.</p><p>Staying in the North Sea for a while, Qin Sang flew into the East Sea, eventually even venturing into the Storm Belt.  The demonic sound was omnipresent!</p><p>He also made a new discovery. Within the Storm Belt, the sensation was clearer than within the barrier protecting the cultivation world.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang was certain. The demonic sound was intertwined with this world's Heavenly Dao, perhaps even caused by a mutation of the Heavenly Dao itself. This was the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound!</p><p>Precisely because of this, only by cultivating to a certain realm could one perceive it.</p><p>This world's Heavenly Dao had undergone a bizarre transformation!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel fortunate.  It was his main body that had broken through, not the Celestial Eye Butterfly. Had the butterfly encountered the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound during its breakthrough, the consequences would have been unimaginable.</p><p>At the edge of the Storm Belt.</p><p>Qin Sang stood within the storm, gazing through the barrier at the boundless sea of the cultivation world.</p><p>Realizing that this was the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, Qin Sang couldn't help but recall everything that had happened.</p><p>Why had True Person Zi Lei, the venerable leader of a sect and the head of the Daoist lineage, fallen to his heart demon tribulation?</p><p>Why had the ancient demon of the Formless Immortal Sect gone mad?</p><p>During the Demon Subjugation War, why had the two Deity Transformation cultivators kept them as assistants, unable to exert their full strength?</p><p>Why had the Holy King Qing Hu coveted the Soul Calming Incense, meticulously scheming to obtain its formula?</p><p>…</p><p>The question was, when did the demonic sound begin to mutate?</p><p>Although protected by the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang was not affected by the madness within the demonic sound, but he could still sense its terror.</p><p>For others, especially during the heart demon tribulation, it would be a fatal threat!</p><p>If the demonic sound had always existed, Deity Transformation cultivators in this world wouldn't be as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, but as rare as one in ten thousand years!</p><p>The Eight Sceneries Sect had been passed down to this day, producing many Deity Transformation cultivators. If True Person Zi Lei had known about the Heavenly Dao's mutation, he wouldn't have rashly faced his tribulation without ample preparation. It would have been tantamount to seeking his own death, illogical.</p><p>Recalling the Immortal Palace's ascension, True Monarch Dan Yu's disappearance, and the ferocious beasts going mad, leaving their lairs, and roaming about, Qin Sang had already arrived at an answer.</p><p>It was highly likely that the demonic sound had suddenly appeared around the time of the Zi Wei Palace's ascension!</p><p>"Zi Wei Palace, Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, the Return to Ruin…"</p><p>Each name surfaced in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>These incredibly mysterious places, according to Ghost Mother, shouldn't have existed in a small thousand world. What shocking secrets did they hold?</p><p>Ghost Mother!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly thought, Ghost Mother's cultivation was sealed at the Nascent Soul stage, unable to break through. Could it be that it wasn't a scheme by her enemies, but protection for her?</p><p>Unfortunately, Ghost Mother had already left this world, making it impossible to verify.</p><p>"Holy King Qing Hu, giving me whatever I wanted, gifting me the Four Saints Spirit Gathering Formation and the Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture, truly had ulterior motives! He clearly wanted to help me reach Deity Transformation sooner, to send me to my death.  If it weren't for the Jade Buddha, during the ritual to summon the Heavenly Demon, I might have already perished, never reaching this day…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes turned cold.</p><p>Holy King Qing Hu acted eccentrically and ruthlessly, having long harbored murderous intentions towards him. His treacherous heart didn't surprise Qin Sang.</p><p>Holy One Hui Guang, acting as the intermediary, did he truly have good intentions?</p><p>The old monk, with his sanctimonious appearance, cooperating with Holy King Qing Hu's carrot-and-stick approach, his purpose was nothing more than to appease him and secure the Soul Calming Incense formula.</p><p>Qin Sang could guess seven or eight parts of Holy One Hui Guang's thoughts.</p><p>With the Immortal Palace's ascension, the Buddhist lineage lost the opportunities within, making it difficult to guarantee the continuous emergence of Deity Transformation cultivators and their dominance over the Central Continent.  Gradual decline was inevitable.</p><p>The path of immortality was arduous, and the cultivators of this world at least had a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Once the cultivators of this world learned that the demonic sound blocked their path, plunging them into despair, how many could endure the loneliness?</p><p>At that time, cultivators would be controlled by the turbid currents of the six desires, and chaos would undoubtedly reign.  Tall trees attract the wind.  Without Deity Transformation cultivators to hold the fort, how long could the Buddhist lineage maintain its dominance?</p><p>Those powerful figures outside the Buddhist lineage, unfettered and without Deity Transformation cultivators to check them, could act recklessly in this world. In Holy One Hui Guang's eyes, they were all unstable factors, best eliminated.</p><p>Even if Holy One Hui Guang hadn't participated, he would have been pleased with Holy King Qing Hu's poisonous scheme.</p><p>However, they never imagined that a treasure like the Jade Buddha existed!</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture and the entire ritual process.</p><p>All previous speculations had to be overturned.</p><p>The changes during the ritual were definitely related to the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, but it could also be inferred that the source of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound wasn't the Extraterrestrial Heavenly Demons.</p><p>Otherwise, he would have immediately drawn down the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that the shriek during the ritual didn't resemble the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound.</p><p>Could it be that the Extraterrestrial Heavenly Demon, upon entering this world, came into contact with the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound and, influenced by it, let out a scream?</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's expression darkened slightly as a more terrifying speculation arose.</p><p>At the time, he had a feeling that the shriek was like a death throe.</p><p>Could it be that the first Extraterrestrial Heavenly Demon he summoned was unable to withstand the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound and was instantly obliterated? This change alerted a powerful being among the Extraterrestrial Heavenly Demons, who 'looked' towards this world, resulting in the second demonic intent being so swift and powerful.</p><p>Because of this, that demonic intent formed the Unborn Demonic Seal, possessing power far exceeding expectations.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's brows furrowed tightly.</p><p>If this were the truth…</p><p>That being, suspected to be an Extraterrestrial Heavenly Demon Monarch, had already cast its gaze here, clashing with the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, and failed to descend into this world. Qin Sang had escaped a calamity.  But they had established a connection through the ritual.  The other party might have noticed him through the altar, perhaps even remembering his aura!</p><p>Legend had it that Extraterrestrial Heavenly Demons regarded cultivators as prey. Once targeted by one, it would be a relentless pursuit, appearing at every breakthrough and tribulation, until transcendence.</p><p>However, only when cultivators broke through to Void Refinement would their tribulations be powerful enough to shake heaven and earth, attracting the attention of external evils. Generally, the strength of the attracted Extraterrestrial Heavenly Demons correlated with the tribulation's intensity. A Void Refinement tribulation wouldn't catch a Heavenly Demon Monarch's eye.</p><p>Other Heavenly Demons wouldn't dare to compete for a Monarch's prey.</p><p>If he was marked by a Heavenly Demon Monarch, his Void Refinement tribulation would mean facing the Monarch directly!</p><p>Could the Jade Buddha suppress his heart demon and withstand a Heavenly Demon Monarch?</p><p>There was no point in thinking so much now. Whether he could leave this world was still unknown. He wouldn't dare to restart the ritual anytime soon.  That Extraterrestrial Heavenly Demon might not have been a Monarch.  Overthinking was useless, purely scaring himself.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled softly.</p><p>Thinking conversely, the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound could prevent a suspected Heavenly Demon Monarch from descending without being extinguished, indicating that the demonic sound was on the same level as the Monarch.</p><p>The cultivators of this world, at most Deity Transformation, were utterly incapable of resolving the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, only able to be at its mercy.</p><p>The only way was to escape this world!</p><p>What was the origin of this small thousand world? Why was it targeted by such a powerful being?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand.</p><p>Having thought this through, Qin Sang had to consider his future path.</p><p>The demonic sound shrouded the world, ferocious beasts ran rampant, and the Return to Ruin, where the ascension beacon was located, was very unstable. The source of the demonic sound might even be in the depths of the Return to Ruin.</p><p>The two Deity Transformation cultivators were organizing people to hunt ferocious beasts.  He wondered what they had learned from the beasts.</p><p>"Are Holy One Hui Guang and Holy King Qing Hu still in this world?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt that they wouldn't dare to stay for too long.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound constantly assaulted their minds, gradually infecting them with madness. The longer they stayed, the deeper the demonic intent would become. If they waited any longer, even if they didn't go mad, their strength would be greatly diminished, leaving them unable to brave the Return to Ruin.</p><p>Because of this, despite having just reached Deity Transformation, Qin Sang didn't feel much apprehension towards the two established Deity Transformation cultivators.</p><p>Firstly, his magical powers and treasures were sufficiently formidable. Secondly, they had to constantly resist the demonic sound's invasion and suppress their demonic thoughts, not daring to attack with full force unless they wanted to follow in the footsteps of the ancient demon of Emperor Bestowed Mountain.</p><p>Of course, he couldn't be arrogant. They had dominated this world for many years, plundering numerous ancient secret realms and possessing countless treasures.</p><p>Thinking from their perspective, if Qin Sang didn't have the Jade Buddha, the only thing he could do was find every possible way to escape this world.</p><p>Holy King Qing Hu brazenly seized the Southern Brightly Fire and the Soul Calming Incense formula.</p><p>Holy One Hui Guang joined forces with the Heavenly Hao Tower and the Eight Sceneries Sect, hastily establishing the Three Sects Alliance, more to maintain stability in the cultivation world than to let the Sweet Dew Chan Monastery dominate alone.</p><p>All these actions indicated their urgent desire to escape.</p><p>After settling all matters and making sufficient preparations, they would likely embark on an eastward journey, seeking a way out.</p><p>Having been schemed against, Qin Sang was naturally furious.</p><p>But he had to consider reality.</p><p>Could he, relying solely on his own strength, traverse the mutated Return to Ruin and reach the ascension beacon?</p><p>If this path was blocked, where should he go?</p><p>Once Holy One Hui Guang and Holy King Qing Hu left, it would be difficult for new Deity Transformation cultivators to appear in this world. By then, it would be hard for Qin Sang to find help.</p><p>But once these two knew he had achieved Deity Transformation, they would surely guess he possessed a treasure to protect his mind. How could he ensure their sincere cooperation and prevent them from harboring malicious intentions?</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang had recently reached Deity Transformation and urgently needed to cultivate in seclusion to solidify his strength.</p><p>Even before the mutation, the Return to Ruin wasn't a place a newly advanced Deity Transformation cultivator could casually enter.  Qin Sang could take his time, but they clearly couldn't wait indefinitely.</p><p>Thinking of this, the image of a figure he could absolutely trust flashed through Qin Sang's mind, and his face darkened.</p><p>Liu Li already had the worry of the evil technique's brand, a flaw in her temperament.  The heart demon tribulation combined with the demonic sound would be certain death!</p><p>Without resolving the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, even if the evil technique's brand could be removed, hope was slim.</p><p>Was she destined to stop here?</p><p>"Soul Calming Incense…"</p><p>Qin Sang thought of this treasure.</p><p>Holy King Qing Hu's claim of needing a large quantity of Soul Calming Incense was undoubtedly a lie. Facing the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, simply increasing the amount of Soul Calming Incense wouldn't be enough to resist it.</p><p>"They must be trying to improve the formula, refining a more potent Soul Calming Incense!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  With the two Deity Transformation cultivators gathering the masters of this art and combining the strength of the two races, it was entirely possible.</p><p>After pondering for a long time, Qin Sang set off towards Deer Wilderness, no longer wandering outside.</p><p>Deer Wilderness rested beside the North Sea.</p><p>The atmosphere in the Daoist grounds was somewhat strange.  His avatar sat cross-legged on the main peak of Deer Wilderness, silent. Shen Chen and the others, unaware of what had happened, gathered at the foot of the mountain, restless.</p><p>Shen Chen was uneasy, glancing towards the peak from time to time. After a few glances, he suddenly froze. Others also noticed a figure that had appeared beside the avatar.</p><p>"Come up."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded towards the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Shen Chen and the others hurriedly ascended, kneeling and kowtowing, chanting praises with Shen Chen at the lead.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't deliberately conceal his cultivation.  Facing him, Shen Chen and the others felt as if they were facing the heavens and the earth themselves, instilling fear without any deliberate action.</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in acknowledgment and looked towards the Nether Moon Guard.</p><p>"In recognition of your previous contributions in searching for treasures, this old man will fulfill his promise and remove the Nether Moon Seal…"</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang finished speaking, the Nether Moon Guard prostrated themselves. "We wish to join the Azure Goat Sect, sincerely assisting the Sect Master and furthering its prestige. We implore Master to accept us."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly.</p><p>He had intended to observe for a while, planning to keep them for a longer period, but unexpectedly, before he could speak, they had volunteered to stay.</p><p>"Join the Azure Goat Sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over them.</p><p>With their lives threatened, the Nether Moon Guard had submitted to enslavement and compromised to survive, which was understandable.</p><p>However, these people were too adaptable, making them difficult to trust.</p><p>In the future, when Qin Sang was no longer in this world, Shen Chen's strength wouldn't be sufficient to control them.  A weak master and strong subordinates would be the root of chaos.</p><p>"Since you wish to stay, become guest elders of the Azure Goat Sect for now.  Based on your performance, we will decide later," Qin Sang said indifferently.</p><p>The Nether Moon Guard felt somewhat disappointed, but being able to be free from their restraints and become guest elders under a Deity Transformation cultivator was an opportunity they hadn't dared to imagine before. They kowtowed repeatedly, expressing their gratitude profusely.</p><p>"You may leave…"</p><p>Qin Sang gave Shen Chen a few more instructions and waved his sleeve, dismissing everyone.</p><p>Shen Chen requested Qin Sang's permission to send invitations to various sects and factions, inviting fellow Daoists to hold a Deity Transformation ceremony, but Qin Sang refused, and he left dejectedly.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the tribulation platform and gently beckoned. The Ice Instrument Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Horn flew into his hand.</p><p>The tribulation formation had indeed consumed a great deal. The Ice Disc was no longer crystalline, its texture becoming like mutton-fat jade, the chilling煞energy within almost depleted. The Fire Rhinoceros Horn was the same, both treasures' luster significantly dimmed, requiring a long period of nurturing in the future.</p><p>The grooves on the outer edge of the Taiji Tribulation Platform were empty, all forty-nine Ice and Fire Tokens destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Taiji Tribulation Platform further. There were cracks on the platform, but the internal restrictions were still intact, not difficult to repair, and it could still be used.</p><p>"Will such rare treasures have a place in the future?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. The tribulation formation could only weaken the Three Disasters Tribulation, having no effect on the heart demon tribulation or the demonic sound.</p><p>Flying down the mountain, Qin Sang first went to the mountain's interior, placing the Ice Instrument Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Horn within the spirit formation to nurture them.</p><p>Returning to his cave dwelling, Qin Sang sat in quiet contemplation and sent out a decree.</p><p>Rustling sounds came from the Earthbound Dragon's cave deep within the bamboo forest.  Several Core Formation Earthbound Dragons rushed out of the cave, flying to the cave dwelling entrance and obediently lying on the ground.</p><p>Then, several points of light drifted out from the cave dwelling, merging into the center of each Earthbound Dragon's brow. The Earthbound Dragons trembled slightly, lowering their heads even further, their eyes filled with a strange light, a mixture of novelty and gratitude.</p><p>The points of light were Emperor Flowing Nectar, capable of enlightening spirit beasts and awakening their intelligence. It was something Qin Sang had obtained previously, and now little remained.</p><p>The avatar nodded to the main body, walked out of the cave dwelling, and lightly patted the spirit beast pouch at his waist. The Earthbound Dragons scrambled to enter, then the avatar's figure flickered repeatedly, flying out of Deer Wilderness.</p><p>He should have let his avatar cultivate in seclusion within the cave dwelling to recover, but circumstances were unpredictable, requiring him to travel once more.</p><p>The avatar left Deer Wilderness, heading directly east, flying into the East Sea, until he reached the vicinity of the so-called East Sea demon race territory, where he released the Earthbound Dragons.</p><p>Then, the avatar returned to the mainland alone, passing through the Fu River mouth and entering the Central Continent once again!</p><p>It was a two-pronged approach, investigating the situation of the two races, thereby deducing the plans and movements of the two Deity Transformation fellow Daoists.</p><p>The main body would temporarily remain in the Deer Wilderness Daoist grounds, consolidating his cultivation as quickly as possible before making further plans.</p>
