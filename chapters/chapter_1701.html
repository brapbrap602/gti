<h1>Chapter 1692: In the Same Boat</h1><p>The avatar, carrying Qin Sang's true body, escaped from Emperor's Bestowal Mountain.  Just as they entered the sword formation, a prickling sensation suddenly ran down their spine. Looking up, they saw a roiling mass of demonic Qi in the distance. The demon horde had arrived!</p><p>Leading the charge was a white figure, grotesque and humanoid in form.  Its limbs were long and thin, with slender fingers, resembling a mountain魈 or倀ghost.  Around it swirled a dense white smoke, seemingly formed from the Qi of Yin souls and ghosts, amplifying the eerie and terrifying aura. Wherever the white figure passed, the very light of day seemed to dim.</p><p>The white figure was the true form of Great Sage Bai Xiao. To execute the Holy King's command, he had directly revealed his demonic body.  On either side of him were two Demon Kings skilled in遁arts, with the other Demon Kings following close behind.</p><p>One was a fleshless bone bird, with a few withered yellow feathers sparsely clinging to its bony wings. The other was a four-winged blood serpent with crimson scales.</p><p>All were monstrous demons of bizarre appearances.</p><p>The gaze the avatar felt came from Bai Xiao. Sharp eyes fixed on Qin Sang and his avatar. Bai Xiao had personally witnessed them fleeing into the sword formation, and he would never allow them to escape so easily.</p><p>Bai Xiao let out a chilling laugh.  With a powerful twist of his arms, the white smoke surrounding him, drawn by some unseen force, rapidly converged, ultimately forming a slender bone sword before him.</p><p>The Four-Winged Blood Serpent and the Bone Bird, having followed Bai Xiao for many years, understood his intent perfectly.  One spat out a blood pearl, while the other vibrated its bony wings, shooting out three demonic feathers.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Three attacks were launched simultaneously.</p><p>Three streams of light—white, yellow, and crimson—appeared above the sword peak, fast as lightning.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Azure light erupted skyward above the sword peak.</p><p>The grand formation, just breached by Qin Sang, immediately began to violently shake. The blood pearl and demonic feathers reached the formation before the bone sword, colliding head-on.  Blood-red light, murky yellow light, and azure light burst forth simultaneously, causing the earth to tremble.</p><p>The bone sword followed close behind, its timing impeccable. It precisely found a weak point in the formation, trailing a long plume of white smoke, descending like a comet.</p><p>The avatar felt a stinging pain all over their body, as if locked onto by a real sword.  Their expression hardened, and with a wave of their arm, a vast expanse of white, icy Qi spread out behind them, forming a long river.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>The bone sword pierced into the river of icy Qi with unstoppable force.</p><p>No ripple was seen.</p><p>The next moment, the expression on Bai Xiao’s face stiffened. The bone sword had inexplicably vanished, and he hadn’t felt any impact. This bizarre occurrence filled him with both shock and fury.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the others, at the same time the Ice Soul Divine Light was unleashed, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly perched on the avatar’s shoulder spread its wings, shooting out a beam of Heavenly Eye Divine Light.</p><p>The bone sword, formed from a divine ability and launched from afar, dissolved upon contact with the Heavenly Eye Divine Light.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was desperate to find a place to heal his wounds and had no desire to tangle with Bai Xiao. The Ice Soul Divine Light not only concealed the Heavenly Eye Divine Light, but also provided cover for his movements.</p><p>Taking advantage of the icy mist, the avatar glanced around, then plunged into the ground.  Their figure flickered, swiftly traversing the sword peaks.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>An unnamed sword peak.</p><p>The avatar, carrying Qin Sang’s true body, crashed into a valley.</p><p>A fierce wind swept through, snapping vegetation and leaving a scene of devastation.</p><p>A clear spring flowed through the valley, and beside it stood a simple wooden hut, likely the dwelling of a sword cultivator, now undoubtedly abandoned.</p><p>The avatar hastily set down Qin Sang's true body. His injuries were continuously worsening, the consequences of consuming two Boiling Snow Pills now manifesting.</p><p>Normally, a Grand Cultivator would need to heal immediately after taking even one Boiling Snow Pill. The damage to their meridians and Qi Sea was only part of the problem. Being infused with such a tremendous amount of foreign Yuan Qi, with no buffer, directly impacted their Dao Foundation. Any delay risked destabilizing it.</p><p>Qin Sang’s true body had managed to endure solely through his robust physique and exceptionally powerful divine sense, far surpassing those of his peers, stabilizing both his body and Dao Foundation.</p><p>In fact, his Yuan Qi wasn’t completely depleted, and the medicinal power of the pills hadn’t fully dissipated.  The combined effect of two Boiling Snow Pills left some residual energy.</p><p>But this remaining Yuan Qi was more of a hindrance than a help.  Qin Sang's true body was unable to control it, focusing all his energy on preventing his injuries from worsening, unable to be distracted.</p><p>To make matters worse, the toxins within his body were stirring, taking advantage of his weakened state. While the protective aura of the antidote pill held them in check, this only worked if Qin Sang had the strength to maintain it.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face was ashen, his brows furrowed, his aura chaotic and weak.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly flapped its wings, taking flight from the avatar. It was thanks to its divine ability that they were able to quickly discern the structure of the Golden Phase Hall’s grand formation.</p><p>Landing on Qin Sang’s shoulder, the butterfly’s soft wings gently brushed against his cheek.  As if sensing his pain, its wings trembled slightly, and a pale blue mist emanated from the Heavenly Eye patterns on them.</p><p>The avatar flashed behind Qin Sang’s true body, placing a hand on his back. Being one and the same, Qin Sang’s true body could safely allow the avatar’s power to enter his body and help regulate his Yuan Qi.</p><p>With the avatar's assistance, his internal condition improved somewhat.</p><p>The pain on Qin Sang's face lessened slightly, but his injuries remained severe. The avatar continued working, hastily finding several bottles of healing pills and stuffing them into Qin Sang's true body.</p><p>Just then, the ground began to shake violently.</p><p>Looking up, demonic figures were already hovering in the air.</p><p>Bai Xiao and the other two demons hung in the sky, their gazes sharp as blades. Quickly noticing something amiss, the Four-Winged Blood Serpent let out a shrill shriek. In a flash of blood-red light, it appeared above the sword peak, its long tail lashing out fiercely.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Blood-red light exploded, the violent impact creating a Yuan Qi hurricane even through the sword formation.  It surged downwards, striking the sword peak and completely plowing through the valley.</p><p>The wooden hut collapsed, exposing the bare earth and stone.</p><p>Qin Sang was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Sensing the danger, Qin Sang had fled the valley beforehand, suppressing his aura as much as possible.  Seemingly running around like a headless fly, he was actually relying on his understanding of the sword formation and the Heavenly Eye divine ability, following the flow of the formation.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>…</p><p>The booming sounds continued.</p><p>Tracking through the grand formation was difficult. The Demon Kings bombarded the area indiscriminately, Bai Xiao, the Four-Winged Blood Serpent, and the Bone Bird taking turns attacking, forcing Qin Sang to keep moving.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang grasped the changes in the nearby formations and unexpectedly sensed a hidden location, quickly escaping into it.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A beam of light entered the dark underground palace, breaking the long-standing darkness.</p><p>Apparently, the original owner had cut corners. The underground palace's restrictions were linked to the protective mountain formation, their structures interconnected, utilizing the power of the grand formation.  Because of this, Qin Sang could enter so easily.</p><p>The furnishings within the underground palace were simple, and it didn’t seem to be a place of great importance.</p><p>With a rare moment of respite, the avatar continued to regulate Qin Sang’s true body's Yuan Qi, but the more they did, the heavier their heart became. Qin Sang’s condition was more troublesome than they had anticipated.</p><p>The gains from this trip to the Unrivaled Immortal Sect were substantial, far exceeding Qin Sang’s expectations, provided he survived to enjoy them. Otherwise, everything was meaningless.</p><p>The depletion of True Yuan wasn’t a major issue. Without Boiling Snow Pills, there were still top-grade spirit stones.</p><p>Facing the Holy King, the avatar hadn't had a chance to act, recovering True Yuan slowly by consuming other pills.  They had saved the top-grade spirit stones for Qin Sang's true body, who could absorb the spiritual Qi from them once his condition improved slightly.</p><p>But now, the problem wasn't True Yuan. Without first suppressing his injuries, Qin Sang’s true body dared not make a move.</p><p>Relying solely on the avatar's strength, even with the Sun God Tree, repelling the Demon Race Holy King would be one thing, but how could they withstand the siege of a group of Demon Kings? Moreover, they could simply surround and wait, continuously wearing them down until Holy King Qing Hu was free to act.</p><p>Now, they could only rely on the grand formation to evade them, unsure if they could hold out until Qin Sang's true body recovered.</p><p>“The true body or the avatar, must I abandon one?” Qin Sang thought bitterly.</p><p>When the time came to make a choice, if possible, he would prioritize sending away his true body.</p><p>…</p><p>At the edge of the Golden Phase Hall.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang flee in this direction, the old nun felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p>She didn't know how much the destruction of the three phantom bodies had affected Holy King Qing Hu, but she certainly didn't want to be dragged into their conflict, let alone risk incurring the wrath of a Nascent Soul cultivator.  The sect's top experts were all here. If they were caught in the crossfire, the consequences would be unbearable for the Hidden Moon Convent.</p><p>Just look at the other cultivators who had intended to explore the Golden Phase Hall.  They had all scattered far and wide.</p><p>She immediately crushed the jade talisman in her hand, ordering a retreat.</p><p>Fortunately, her junior sister had sent back a message. They had already broken through most of the restrictions in the secret hall and obtained a portion of the treasures, a bountiful harvest.</p><p>Having received the warning, they dared not linger, hastily withdrawing.</p><p>After the old nun regrouped with her junior sisters, she looked back towards the west, but found no trace of Liu Li.</p><p>“Did she see the battle at Emperor's Bestowal Mountain and take a detour?”</p><p>Just as this thought crossed her mind, a cold voice rang out from the shadows of the nearby rocks, “Abbess.”</p><p>Liu Li, having arrived unnoticed, emerged from the darkness.  Not only did she not fly openly on her sword, but she also suppressed her aura as much as possible.</p><p>Seeing the battle between Qin Sang and the Nascent Soul demon, Liu Li had concealed herself in the shadows.</p><p>Qin Sang had used the Listening Snow Pavilion’s secret technique to refine his avatar, and the avatar also cultivated the *Ice Soul Divine Light*. Sharing the same source, their auras were similar. If she didn't conceal herself, she might be discovered by the Nascent Soul demon and implicated.</p><p>“It’s good that you’re back!”</p><p>The old nun’s expression relaxed. She said solemnly, “We can’t stay here any longer! Although our gains are less than expected, this is still a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. Return and cultivate in seclusion, and your cultivation will surely advance greatly.  Know when to stop, and don’t be swayed by greed.”</p><p>These words were not only for Liu Li but also a warning to the other junior sisters who were still feeling reluctant.</p><p>Once the old monk suppressed the demonic being and was free to act, he would surely target them, the remnants of the Unrivaled Immortal Sect.  Staying this long was already a risk.</p><p>“Such a pity!  Give us a little more time, and we could have broken through the final sword Qi seal on that secret hall! Judging by our previous findings, there must be sword cultivation treasures inside, extremely valuable, perhaps even the *Grand Essence Golden罡Sword Scripture*!” a young nun said, unwilling to give up.</p><p>“Junior Sister Ying, you must have drawn a map of the protective mountain formation while exploring the Golden Phase Hall, right? Give me the map, and I’ll retrieve the treasures from the secret hall,” Liu Li said, extending her hand.</p><p>These words surprised everyone.</p><p>The old nun waved her whisk, stopping Liu Li.  “Junior Sister, don't be reckless…”</p><p>Liu Li interrupted the old nun, insisting, “Since I joined the convent, I’ve received much care but have made no contributions. The cultivation methods and techniques I practice are not from the Unrivaled Immortal Sect’s lineage. Others don’t know I belong to the Hidden Moon Convent, so I won’t be targeted.”</p><p>Hearing this, the others were tempted. The young nun was especially eager, already taking out a jade slip with a hopeful expression.</p><p>The old nun remained silent, gazing intently at Liu Li.</p><p>After a long while, she glanced back at the Golden Phase Hall, but not in the direction of the secret hall. Then, she looked at the floating lake above, which had suddenly become turbulent.  She spoke to a female lay disciple beside her, “This place is fraught with danger. We can't let Junior Sister Liu Li go alone. I’ll stay behind to provide support. Junior Sister, you take them and leave first.”</p><p>The female lay disciple was stunned.</p><p>Before she could respond, the old nun took the jade slip from the young nun’s hand, her tone leaving no room for argument, urging them to leave.</p><p>“The ancestral mansion is full of people and prying eyes.  Don't go to the teleportation formation yet. Leave the mansion directly through the main entrance. The other sects are either occupied with the ancient demon or busy searching for treasures, and they won't be able to pay attention to you. There shouldn't be any obstacles. Remember not to linger."</p><p>Everyone understood that the teleportation formation was meant for the Abbess and Liu Li, and none of the nuns objected.</p><p>The young nun, filled with both anticipation and worry, said, “We found several secret passages in the Golden Phase Hall… Abbess, Senior Sister Liu Li, please be careful.”</p><p>The old nun spoke sternly, giving orders as the Abbess. The female lay disciple dared not disobey, immediately calling her junior sisters, bidding farewell to the two, suppressing their auras, and heading towards the entrance of the Unrivaled Immortal Sect.</p><p>Watching the nuns depart, the old nun turned back, handing the jade slip to Liu Li.  "Have you considered the dangers within, Junior Sister?"</p><p>"Thank you, Abbess."</p><p>Liu Li accepted the jade slip, knowing that the Abbess might have sensed something.</p><p>Her joining the Hidden Moon Convent had been a coincidence, and she had formed a bond with the Abbess.  Apart from the restriction on leaving freely, the convent’s rules weren't strict.  The Abbess could also help her understand Buddhist teachings, which was exactly what she needed. So, she had accepted the invitation to join.</p><p>She didn't have deep feelings for the Hidden Moon Convent.</p><p>Nor did she have high expectations for it.</p><p>With the Demon Race Holy King looming above, what right did she have to ask the old nun to gamble the sect's survival?</p><p>Regardless of the old nun’s intentions, her willingness to stay now was nothing short of timely help.  So, Liu Li expressed her sincere gratitude.</p><p>Liu Li immersed her mind into the jade slip.</p><p>They had been exploring the Golden Phase Hall for a while now. Combined with the sect’s existing records, they had a general understanding of the protective mountain formation's structure and flow, and many parts were very detailed, which could be utilized.</p><p>At this moment, the Golden Phase Hall was permeated with demonic Qi.</p><p>Unable to find Qin Sang, and finding it difficult to search through the protective mountain formation, Bai Xiao simply led the demons to surround a large area of sword peaks, trapping Qin Sang within.</p><p>The demons formed a formation, each occupying a sword peak, vigilantly watching their surroundings.</p><p>The Four-Winged Blood Serpent and the Bone Bird continued to attack, while Bai Xiao stopped, white smoke billowing from his body and drifting upwards, forming a head-sized white mass of Qi.  Finally, it transformed into the shape of an eyeball.</p><p>The eyeball hovered in the air, able to rotate in any direction, a truly bizarre sight. It scanned the area below, preventing Qin Sang from hiding or escaping.</p><p>The next moment, the demons attacked the formation simultaneously.</p><p>The peaks trembled, and the grand formation shook violently.</p><p>By now, Liu Li and the old nun had infiltrated the Golden Phase Hall.  To the old nun’s surprise, Liu Li’s movements were purposeful. She quickly approached the vicinity of the demon formation, but didn’t dare get too close due to the demonic eye hovering above.</p><p>Then, Liu Li stopped at a certain spot, discreetly unleashing the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>Her Ice Soul Divine Light was inherently silent, and with the cover provided by the turbulence caused by the attacks on the grand formation, it went unnoticed.  The divine light infiltrated the formation, its target the place where Qin Sang was hiding.</p><p>In the Northern Sea, she had discovered that due to the hidden dangers of the evil cultivation technique, she could sense Qin Sang within a certain distance through the brand.  Before, Qin Sang must have been inside Emperor's Bestowal Mountain, concealed by the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, so the brand hadn't reacted.</p><p>Inside a dark chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang’s true body's aura had stabilized and showed signs of improvement.  Just as he was about to deduce how to escape, he opened his eyes in surprise.</p>
