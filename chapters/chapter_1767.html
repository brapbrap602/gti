<h1>Chapter 1758: Crane Cry Mountain</h1><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword plunged into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>The large man slid down the stone wall and fell to the ground, revealing his true form: a magnificent tiger.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the corpse and surveyed the dark chamber.</p><p>The room's furnishings were sparse. Besides the two stone chambers housing the jade sphere and the teleportation array, there were only two other rooms.</p><p>For two transformed-stage demons, this place seemed too meager to be a cultivation site.</p><p>This was clearly a temporary cave dwelling!</p><p>Yet, this makeshift dwelling was meticulously protected by a defensive formation.</p><p>Breaking through the stone wall with a single sword strike was only possible because the Sky-Eyed Butterfly first used its abilities to detect weaknesses in the formation, combined with the power of the pseudo-spiritual treasure Grey Warbler Sword and the Seven Souls Killing Array.</p><p>With Qin Sang's improving cultivation, his understanding of the Seven Killing Sword Array had deepened.  He could now wield it with greater ease and precision, no longer needing the extravagant displays of the past.</p><p>Outsiders only saw a flash of sword light, but it actually contained the might of the sword array.</p><p>With a defensive formation outside and a teleportation array inside, two demonic beasts hiding here—it was clearly a premeditated act, prompting suspicion about their intentions.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the tiger demon's corpse, noticing a jade bracelet on its right wrist. He drew it in and found it to be a spatial treasure.</p><p>After searching through it, Qin Sang retrieved a gold seal bearing two characters in the demonic script of Guifang.</p><p>"Yu Shuai."</p><p>After deciding to rush to Jushan, Qin Sang had been paying close attention to intelligence on Guifang, anticipating it as a potential major enemy.</p><p>Guifang was known as the land of demon-ghosts.  It wasn't solely populated by demons, but demon cultivators formed the majority.</p><p>Even more blatant than the Dao Court, Guifang’s name even included the word "country," and like the Dao Court, it had established official positions with clear hierarchies, mirroring a proper nation-state.</p><p>Only transformed-stage demon cultivators were eligible for the rank of Demon Marshal (Yaoshuai). Above them were Demon Marquises (Yaohou), and above that, Kings.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet investigated the highest levels, unsure if all Demon Kings were Nascent Soul-stage cultivators, but Guifang's prolonged stalemate with the Dao Court indicated the presence of top-tier powerhouses.</p><p>The seal confirmed the tiger demon's high-ranking status as a Guifang Demon Marshal.</p><p>The character 'Yu' had multiple interpretations.</p><p>It could be the tiger demon's title.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that tiger demons had a moniker of “Yu Li” in the cultivation world.</p><p>The escaped demon was likely also a Demon Marshal. Two Guifang Demon Marshals lurking in such a remote area wouldn't be ambushing a few Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back towards the mountain's exterior. He had effortlessly captured the strongest white tiger, greatly easing the pressure on Shi Xuan and the others. The battle at the Blue Fox Temple was nearing its end.</p><p>The tiger demon's bracelet contained other useful treasures, which Qin Sang temporarily put away before examining the corpse further.</p><p>The tiger demon had been killed by a single sword strike before it could truly display its strength. Qin Sang didn't see any remaining inner spirit, but sensed a similar energy fluctuation to that of the snake demon.</p><p>"Senior Qingfeng… this is…"</p><p>Shi Xuan's hesitant voice echoed from outside the cave.</p><p>With most of the demonic gods slain and three captured—including the white tiger subdued by Qin Sang—the three quickly arrived with their prisoners.  Seeing the tiger demon's corpse, they were terrified.</p><p>Shi Xuan never imagined that their casually recruited helper was a True Cultivator, nor that such a seemingly simple task concealed mortal danger.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned several demon gods for questioning and discovered they didn't recognize the tiger demon.</p><p>They had inexplicably awakened recently, guided by a mysterious will to build temples, pose as demon gods, perform miracles among the ghost people, and gain their worship.</p><p>It was clear these demon gods' awakening was connected to the two Demon Marshals.</p><p>Qin Sang, unaware of the details, couldn’t fathom their intentions.  However, recalling the Dao Court's appointed righteous gods, he sensed an underlying conspiracy.</p><p>Shi Xuan and the others realized this too; the best course of action was to immediately report this to the Dao Court.</p><p>But since Qin Sang had killed the tiger demon, they dared not speak, even the usually flamboyant Shen Huo became unusually silent.</p><p>Knowing he couldn't stay, Qin Sang tossed the marshal's seal and several demon gods back, then kicked the tiger corpse towards Shi Xuan.  He asked, "These should fetch a considerable amount of merit, right?"</p><p>Shi Xuan caught the seal, glanced at it, and his face showed shock. "Taking this Demon Marshal's corpse and this news back will be a great accomplishment, regardless of whether we can expose Guifang's conspiracy. The Dao Court will surely reward you handsomely. The Dao Court has always been generous to those who merit reward."</p><p>He didn't dare to share the credit with Qin Sang and decided to persuade his companions to give all the original rewards to Qin Sang.</p><p>As they spoke, everyone gathered their spoils and, with their captives, flew away from the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang led the way, the other three close behind.</p><p>Instead of returning the way they came, they decided to take a detour to avoid any pursuers.</p><p>They flew for several days without encountering any enemies.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang stopped, descending to a desolate mountain. Turning his head, he said, “We should be safe from pursuit now. Are you going directly to Crane Cry Mountain?  Perhaps we should return the spoils first, and I'll have Shi Daoyou accept my share of the merit. I have other matters to attend to that will take several days. I'll meet you at Crane Cry Mountain soon.”</p><p>Crane Cry Mountain is the largest immortal city in Ju Shan Prefecture. Legend has it that the name originates from a sacred mountain in Daoist lore.</p><p>The Daoist Court will issue its decrees at Crane Cry Mountain, with a True Person overseeing the city. However, the city is not solely under the Daoist Court's control; factions like the Yin Tian Palace, also rooted in Ju Shan Prefecture, are present, creating a diverse and often chaotic mix of power.</p><p>Given the Daoist Court's resources, controlling the city would be effortless. It is said this arrangement is intentional, designed to maintain a delicate balance and understanding.</p><p>As a result, Crane Cry Mountain's reputation has grown, becoming the largest hub for Daoist cultivators in Ju Shan Prefecture.</p><p>Shi Xuan and the others had originally planned to go to Crane Cry Mountain after completing the task in the decree, intending to train in Ju Shan Prefecture for a while.  Given recent events, they were even more determined to return quickly.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's words, Shi Xuan and the others were momentarily stunned, but they didn't dare to question him.  After agreeing on how to contact each other, they bid farewell to Qin Sang and hurried away.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried about them keeping his share of the merit. Watching them leave, he glanced around, then vanished into a nearby mountain.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his cave dwelling, his expression tinged with gloom.</p><p>He calculated that in about thirty years, it would have been six hundred years since his breakthrough to the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>This meant the second Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation was approaching.</p><p>The Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation occurs every three hundred years, a severe test for cultivators, and its difficulty doesn't diminish with increased cultivation.</p><p>If someone is unfortunate enough to break through to the Transformation God stage just before the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, they must be prepared to endure two consecutive tribulations.</p><p>Qin Sang could already sense the tribulation's aura, and even leaving the Storm Realm hadn't delayed it.</p><p>Before this, Qin Sang hadn’t worried about the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, even though his current condition was exceptionally poor and he faced numerous limitations.</p><p>The tribulation's power increases with each occurrence and is somewhat related to the cultivator's cultivation level, but not excessively so; there’s an upper limit.</p><p>In the cultivation world, those like him, encountering a second Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation only after breaking through to the Transformation God stage, are extremely rare, at least in the Storm Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang judged that with the assistance of his Sky-Eyed Butterfly, numerous treasures and secret techniques at his disposal, two top-tier sword formations, the postnatal Wooden Man Stele refined using the Dao Evolution Tree, and the “Inner Lion Seal” which could instantly heal his injuries, even with his strength not fully restored, he had ample confidence in surviving this tribulation, therefore, he wasn't overly anxious.</p><p>Unexpectedly, while slaying demons earlier, he had felt a sudden, inexplicable palpitation.</p><p>After a month of seclusion, reflecting deeply, he discovered that it might originate from the next tribulation!</p><p>The next tribulation might undergo a change, potentially threatening his life!</p><p>He wondered if coming to this different world caused the tribulation's anomaly.</p><p>There were no relevant records among the sects of the Storm Realm; it was completely uncharted territory, with no past experience to draw upon.</p><p>This feeling seemed ethereal, but since life and death were at stake, Qin Sang didn't dare to be negligent.</p><p>Only two paths lay before him:  quickly find a method to stabilize his spiritual energy and restore his strength, or seek a breakthrough in body refinement, regaining his Transformation God-level combat prowess.</p><p>After years of investigation, Qin Sang knew that the method to stabilize his spiritual energy could only be found through Daoist positions of authority.</p><p>How to obtain such a position, Qin Sang already had some ideas, but whether he could obtain the qualification for a Transformation God-level position within thirty years remained uncertain.</p><p>The higher the position, the more difficult it was to pass the assessment, requiring careful planning and leaving no room for error.</p><p>The path of body refinement, however, offered more hope.</p><p>Body cultivators thrived in this realm.</p><p>With the Six-day Ancient Qi Tempering method, combined with the unrefined Dragon Pool liquid within him, and by obtaining more beneficial body-refining elixirs, Qin Sang was confident that he could cultivate the "Celestial Demon Refining Form" to its peak fourth stage within thirty years.</p><p>The only challenge was where to find a location to draw stellar energy for body refinement.</p><p>While traveling through Zhong Mao Prefecture and Bai Shi Prefecture, Qin Sang had specifically searched but found no such place.</p><p>“Crane Cry Mountain…”</p><p>Qin Sang looked north.</p><p>Because of its unique status, Crane Cry Mountain City was undoubtedly the place where news spread fastest. He might wait until he entered the city to gather information before making a decision.</p><p>…</p><p>Perhaps due to the rampant demons, the weather in Ju Shan Prefecture was consistently overcast rather than clear.</p><p>This world seemed forever shrouded in a gloomy, lingering Yin Qi.</p><p>Even Crane Cry Mountain, the renowned number one immortal city, was no exception.</p><p>As its name suggested, Crane Cry Mountain City was indeed built on a mountain range, but not just one mountain, rather a vast, seemingly endless expanse of peaks connected together.</p><p>True Crane Cry Mountain refers to the most majestic peak at the heart of the range, now used to refer to the entire city.</p><p>The city of immortals was built atop a mountain.</p><p>Below lay a vast, bottomless lake, its surface shrouded in mist.</p><p>It seemed as if some divine power had cleaved the earth, lifting this land a mile high, supported by a thousand peaks, to cradle the celestial city.</p><p>Looking up from the lake, one saw a landmass suspended in the heavens.</p><p>The city had eight entrances, one in each direction, each marked by a wide stone staircase winding down the mountainside and into the lake.</p><p>Regardless of status, even celestial officials from the Daoist Court had to descend and walk.</p><p>From afar, the city seemed to lack walls or powerful protective formations.</p><p>Yet, no one was foolish enough to cause trouble here.  Even the Gui Fang army would deliberately avoid Crane Cry Mountain.</p><p>Not only were Daoist Court officials stationed here, but legend held that the Yin Tian Palace Master's dwelling was nearby, though its location remained a mystery.</p><p>South Gate of the Immortal City.</p><p>Two cultivators, faces hidden by wide-brimmed hats and clad in dark robes, were descending the mountain.</p><p>One shook his head, muttering, “Bad luck! Those demonic cultivators kept me busy for half an hour, and all the Daoist Court’s decrees were taken.”</p><p>His companion exclaimed, “Brother, haven’t you always condemned the Daoist Court’s autocratic rule and indolence?  Why would you accept their decrees?”</p><p>The first cultivator snorted.  “I criticize the Court for its inaction; its harsh internal policies yet its failure to eradicate the demonic threat and restore peace, allowing the Gui Fang to grow strong!  These decrees mostly involve hunting demons, and the Court's rewards are generous. Why wouldn't I accept them?”</p><p>His companion chuckled. “Brother, you’re certainly clear about your likes and dislikes. But with so many decrees left unclaimed, why didn’t you take one to avoid returning empty-handed…?”</p><p>“Do you take me for a fool?”</p><p>…</p><p>The two continued their descent, oblivious to a young man who passed them.</p><p>This was Qin Sang, who had traveled a great distance.</p><p>The city had no walls, nor proper gates; ascending the steps was tantamount to entering.</p><p>There was no rigorous inspection, only a bronze mirror hanging in mid-air.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly, observing the mirror impassively.  His expression unchanged, he entered the city; the mirror remained unreactive.</p><p>He wasn’t in a hurry to find Shi Xuan and the others. He sought the Daoist Court first, easily locating its position.</p><p>Flight was prohibited within the city, but celestial birds, beasts, and palanquins offered transport. Qin Sang rented a palanquin and entered a meditative state.</p><p>After an unknown time, he was awakened by the beast pulling the vehicle.</p><p>“Your Excellency, we’ve arrived at the Tian Shu Academy.”</p><p>Qin Sang disembarked, paid the fare, and saw, to his left, a hazy landscape of pavilions and halls, seemingly floating amidst clouds, a truly celestial scene: the Tian Shu Academy.</p><p>To the right, opposite the Tian Shu Academy, was the Bei Ji Exorcism Academy.</p><p>Its style was more austere and solemn, dominated by black, square stone halls.</p><p>Hundred-foot-tall archways stood before both academies, inscribed with celestial script bearing their names.</p><p>Though separate, the academies were essentially one within Ju Shan City, united by their common goal – slaying demons and ghosts!</p><p>Many Daoists were gathered below the archways.</p><p>Qin Sang sent a strand of his consciousness into the Tian Shu Academy's archway, immediately finding himself in a dark space, “seeing” floating orbs of golden light.</p><p>Each orb contained a golden decree, the famed Daoist Court mandates.</p><p>The other side was the same.</p><p>The Daoist Court issued new decrees periodically; those gathered below the archways waited for them.  The remaining decrees were exceptionally dangerous, currently unclaimed.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly judged many too difficult even for himself.</p><p>Nevertheless, he studied them with interest, particularly the rewards, many of which included unheard-of treasures.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang uttered a soft exclamation, noticing a reward that allowed one to request the assistance of a single Daoist Court's Supreme Lord, provided it didn't violate the Dao.</p><p>Upon further examination, he discovered that he could, through the Daoist Court, enlist the aid of a far stronger cultivator, provided he offered sufficient merit!</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart pounded.</p><p>That evening.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself in a small shop specializing in intelligence, questioning the white-haired old Daoist within.</p><p>“Which faction within our Daoist sect is most proficient in summoning starlight incantations?”</p><p>The old Daoist gave him a curious look. “The Daoist Court's Zheng Shang Ying Dou Department, naturally; the celestial officials are most adept at star-slaying incantations.”</p><p>(End)</p>
