<h1>Chapter 2163: The Celestial Child</h1><p>Shaoshi approached Qin Sang, and they exchanged a glance.  They had thoroughly searched the lair of the great beast, but found no trace of the lingering glow, leaving them both curious about its origin.</p><p>They soared into the air, pursuing the glow towards its source.</p><p>The glow seemed to be rapidly being absorbed by a monstrous creature, quickly fading.</p><p>They chased it deep into the secluded realm, watching as the glow contracted into a single beam of light, before flickering once and vanishing completely.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi arrived at the scene, looking down at a expanse of ruined walls, the collapsed remains of an ancient temple.</p><p>Their spiritual senses swept across the ruins, detecting no unusual fluctuations. Qin Sang and Shaoshi worked together, systematically removing debris layer by layer until they uncovered a deep pit. Still, nothing unusual was found.</p><p>"This ancient temple is likely unrelated to the glow," Shaoshi stated.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the area, concentrating their senses. With the glow's disappearance, all fluctuations had ceased.</p><p>If that were the case, then what was the origin of the glow?</p><p>The great beast's lair and this secluded realm clearly had no connection, leaving Qin Sang and Shaoshi baffled as to any underlying pattern.</p><p>"Since there's no discernible pattern, the glow was likely one of the trials in this sacred land," Emperor Si's voice echoed from behind.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi turned to see Emperor Si hovering above a lake, gazing down at the surface.</p><p>Shaoshi nodded. "Indeed! If the glow is related to the trials, more instances of it will undoubtedly appear.  We will soon understand the secret behind the glow."</p><p>Turning to Qin Sang, he added, "Qin Zhenren, having never participated in the sacred land trials, may be unaware of their nature. The trials are ever-changing, sometimes simple—like scattering precious treasures for everyone to compete for, with the strongest claiming the prize.  Other times, they are unpredictable and inscrutable, demanding luck, wisdom, and self-discovery."</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Emperor Si reached towards the lake's surface. The water churned, and several emerald green beams shot up from below—several knee-high stalks of bamboo, imbued with spiritual energy, as green as jade.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, several Amber Cloud Bamboos grow here. Share them amongst yourselves."</p><p>Except for the ancient temple containing the treasure box, all the other halls were empty. Emperor Si had obtained the greatest benefits but still shared some spoils with Qin Sang and Shaoshi.</p><p>Qin Sang received half the bamboos. Amber Cloud Bamboo is a type of spiritual wood, usable as material for refining spiritual treasures, though Qin Sang couldn't immediately think of a use for them and considered giving them to Qingyang Temple or Wulei Academy later.</p><p>The Yunyoo Sword could continue to absorb spiritual wood, but at the innate spiritual treasure level, the improvement from ordinary spiritual wood was minimal.</p><p>At that moment, figures approached from a distance—the Crown Prince and his two companions, returning.</p><p>Having received a warning, they deliberately avoided encountering Marquis Dingyuan, but failed to kill Marquis Dingyuan's accomplice.  In the end, neither side suffered any casualties.</p><p>With the glow and the grey figures gone, the Crown Prince and his companions arrived, still appearing somewhat strained.</p><p>Perhaps due to the incident, the power of the Mist River was increasing at an unprecedented rate.</p><p>After discussion, they decided to leave immediately.  Although more treasures floated in the Mist River, the surging power made the place increasingly dangerous, making prolonged stay inadvisable.</p><p>They carefully retraced their steps, returning from the Mist River to the tomb passage without encountering any ambush.  Marquis Dingyuan and his group were nowhere to be seen, having apparently left.</p><p>Successfully exiting the tomb passage and the abyss, they found everything normal.  Qin Sang bowed to Emperor Si in farewell.</p><p>He would first meet Si Lu before heading to the rendezvous point with Liuli.</p><p>"The origin of the glow is unknown, and the situation is uncertain. Qin Zhenren, would you consider joining forces with us? If you agree, I will do my utmost to assist you in acquiring any opportunities and treasures suitable for you."</p><p>Emperor Si made a final effort, showing remarkable generosity to win over Qin Sang, a top-tier expert, to assist them in completing the trials.</p><p>Shaoshi also tried to persuade him, but Qin Sang's mind was set, simply saying that he would carefully consider it before bowing and departing.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang disappear into the distance, Shaoshi sighed softly, "This man is unwilling to be subservient; only inducements can sway him."</p><p>Unfortunately, there were few treasures capable of tempting such a powerful individual.</p><p>"This person's entry into the sacred land likely has ulterior motives, but it's none of our concern."</p><p>The journey went surprisingly smoothly.  Qing Dao and the others should be arriving soon. Let's return and wait for them to rendezvous…”</p><p>Si Huang turned away, leading his people back the way they came.</p><p>Returning to their meeting point, Si Huang and Shao Shi landed.  Suddenly sensing something, Si Huang turned towards the nearby forest and sharply called out, "Who's there! Show yourself!"</p><p>The Third Prince and the others looked over in confusion.</p><p>A faint aura was hidden within the forest, perceptible only to Si Huang and Shao Shi. It didn't belong to anyone they recognized.</p><p>After a moment, a gentle breeze stirred, and a figure emerged from the edge of the woods.</p><p>The person was dressed in a brocade robe, remarkably small, appearing to be a child of eight or nine years old, exquisitely beautiful. The robe was oversized, its long sleeves almost dragging on the ground, making the whole appearance somewhat comical.</p><p>He also had a pearl on his forehead, clearly identifying him as a Si You tribesman, and a top-tier expert at the peak of the Sky Realm Stage Two. However, Si Huang and the others didn't recognize him.</p><p>The child stood with his hands behind his back, an air of arrogance about him.  His gaze swept across the group, settling on Si Huang. He said calmly, "You are the current Si Huang?"</p><p>Everyone frowned subtly. Although the child's cultivation was high, Si Huang and Shao Shi were no less powerful.  Furthermore, Si Huang was the acknowledged ruler of the Si You tribe; the child's demeanor was overly arrogant.</p><p>"You are...?"</p><p>Si Huang examined the child, noticing a token at his waist, and his expression changed.</p><p>The child snorted. "As Si Huang, you don't even recognize this token?"</p><p>Si Huang's face shifted.  To the astonishment of everyone present, he bowed.  "I do not know which Grandmaster's celestial child has graced us with their presence. I apologize for the lack of proper welcome, I beg your forgiveness, celestial child!"</p><p>Hearing this, the others were shocked, understanding dawning on them.  No wonder this child's cultivation was so high yet his name was unknown.</p><p>As the saying goes, when one person achieves enlightenment, even the chickens and dogs prosper.</p><p>When Yi Ren tribe experts reach the Saint Realm, they enter the Holy Land to cultivate. But Saint Realm experts are not loners; they often bring close relatives and servants into the Holy Land.</p><p>These individuals, surrounded by Saint Realm Grandmasters, lack for nothing and frequently receive guidance, making their cultivation far easier than in the outside world.</p><p>This child was clearly a servant of a Saint Realm Grandmaster, thus justifying his arrogance.</p><p>"You don't need to know my master's identity! I ask you…"</p><p>The child's face hardened, his voice sharp. "Where have you hidden the murderer of my senior brother?!"</p><p>Hearing this, Shao Shi was startled, guessing the child's origin, likely connected to the Lu family's Grand Protector.</p><p>Among the Si You tribe's top experts, only the Grand Protector's background remained unclear. He'd never publicly revealed his origins, but some things weren't secret.</p><p>It was said that those who enter the Holy Land to cultivate with Saint Realm experts find it difficult to leave, subject to various restrictions. Though rare, such individuals had appeared before, returning to the mortal realm with various objectives.</p><p>During the War of the Stormy Sea, Shao Shi had even tested the Grand Protector. However, he would absolutely not admit it now!</p><p>Si Huang remained composed, questioning, "I do not know which senior brother the celestial child refers to, nor who the murderer is.  I beg the celestial child to clarify. If your words are true, I will absolutely not protect the murderer, but I fear there may be a misunderstanding…"</p><p>At this moment, he understood the child's intentions.</p><p>After the Lu family's Grand Protector's death, he hadn't considered informing the Holy Land. Firstly, the tribe had strict orders against disturbing the Grandmasters lightly, bound by ancient covenants; Grandmasters rarely intervened in disputes among the younger generation. Secondly, the Grand Protector had always ignored the Si You royal family, possibly reflecting the attitude of his Grandmaster. Thirdly, it was unclear whether this child had left the Holy Land willingly or been expelled.</p><p>Qin Zhenren was backed by the Zhu Yan tribe's chief, and the Lu family had initiated the attack; the counterattack was forced.</p><p>If that Grandmaster were enraged and retaliated, using their power to bully the weak, causing discord between the tribes, the Saint Realm Grandmaster would be unharmed, but they could suffer repercussions.</p><p>The so-called Si Huang and the royal family were never irreplaceable.</p><p>"Misunderstanding?"</p><p>The child's eyes blazed. He didn't believe Si Huang was unaware of his senior brother's identity, believing him to be feigning ignorance.</p><p>However, he was helpless against Si Huang, so he suppressed his anger, revealing his senior brother's identity.</p><p>"It was the Lu family's Grand Protector!"</p><p>Si Huang feigned shock, explaining rapidly, "The Lu family has always opposed me, Lu Wang even secretly plotted to usurp my throne. I have long admired the Grand Protector, but he always ignored my invitations. I had no idea the Grand Protector was a celestial child of a Grandmaster! My conflict with Lu Wang was ongoing, but we had always avoided open warfare.  The Grand Protector's accidental death at the hands of outsiders has nothing to do with me. Please, celestial child, believe me!"</p><p>The child said coldly, "I know you didn't kill my senior brother, otherwise, I would not spare you!"</p><p>He glanced at Shao Shi.</p><p>A court official's heart skipped a beat. He sighed, "My young master, you don't know.  During that battle, although I was present, the High Priest didn't trust me and kept me in the rear. The change happened so quickly; I couldn't intervene. To my shame, I was no match for that person and could only flee. Later, I was forced to sue for peace."</p><p>With no witnesses, the young master's fury had no outlet. He sneered, "You didn't avenge your kin, yet you brought the murderer into the Sacred Land! Do you even know the meaning of shame?!"</p><p>The Emperor's expression darkened.</p><p>This young master had come seeking revenge.  Others, even if resentful, would outwardly try to win them over, helping them find and avenge their enemy.</p><p>This young master's behavior suggested either an overly comfortable life in the Sacred Land, or exceptional strength, making him disregard others. Such a person, once set on something, is hard to change.</p><p>The Emperor had wanted to win over this powerful kinsman, but now it seemed he'd be a burden. His tone hardened, "This wasn't Qin Zhenren's sole decision. Bringing him into the Sacred Land was approved by the entire clan; we had our reasons. Of course, had I known this would happen, I would never have agreed.  But the young master is too late. Qin Zhenren has already left."</p><p>The young master flew into a rage. "What? Didn't you invite him to explore the hidden realm? How could he leave so quickly! You're shielding the murderer! Aren't you afraid I'll report you to the Grand Master?!"</p><p>The discovery of the hidden realm in the Sacred Land by the Imperial family had long been no secret within the Siyou clan.</p><p>The young master's quick threat to report him to the Grand Master didn't faze the Emperor; he suspected the Grand Master was unaware.</p><p>"Normally, exploration would take some time, and success wasn't guaranteed. But the realm unexpectedly underwent a transformation. We effortlessly reached the deepest part and obtained the treasure we sought. I had no reason to keep Qin Zhenren. He left on his own after we exited the realm," the Emperor explained honestly.</p><p>"I swear, this is the complete truth!  My dealings with Qin Zhenren were purely transactional; I had no reason to risk the Grand Master's wrath by protecting him."</p><p>The young master's face froze.  Such a coincidence! He'd rushed here upon learning the murderer was in the Sacred Land, only to be too late.</p><p>"Do you know where he's gone?"</p><p>"Qin Zhenren is cautious and never revealed a word," the Emperor shook his head.</p><p>The young master's expression shifted, then, after learning the direction Qin Sang had taken, he tossed a jade talisman.</p><p>"If you encounter him, crush this talisman. Once I avenge my senior brother, I'll report your merit to the Grand Master!"</p><p>With that, the young master left.</p><p>"Your Majesty, this jade talisman…"</p><p>The court official hesitated.</p><p>The Emperor closed his hand around it, his eyes narrowed, saying meaningfully, "Act as the situation demands!"</p><p>…</p><p>After the young master left, he landed on a mountain peak, at a flattened stone platform where several figures sat. One was Yuan Jian, the Siyou clan's Grand Elder.</p><p>Yuan Jian opened his eyes. Seeing the young master's expression, he guessed, "The young master didn't find him?"</p><p>The young master, still seething, "The Emperor has the treasure; that man is gone!"</p><p>"So fast?"</p><p>Yuan Jian was surprised, then sighed, "A pity! I didn't expect him to enter the Sacred Land, and with the Emperor, wasting precious time and a perfect opportunity."</p><p>The young master waved his hand, "It's not your fault. Thanks to your warning, I wasn't misled. But the Emperor knew and didn't tell me, letting the enemy escape!"</p><p>A flicker of sadness crossed Yuan Jian's eyes. He sighed, "I and the High Priest bonded quickly and agreed to explore the Sacred Land together.  Thankfully, the High Priest left a token to contact the young master. I couldn't act openly back then but helped secretly. Yet, fate is unpredictable; those outsiders hid such terrifying methods!"</p><p>The young master looked at Yuan Jian and spoke frankly, "Don't worry. My senior brother always keeps his word; I'll fulfill his promise. However, we're restricted in the Sacred Land and can't easily leave our chambers. Our knowledge of this place isn't much better than yours; success isn't guaranteed."</p><p>Joy filled Yuan Jian's heart. The young master's promise was enough!</p>
