<h1>Chapter 2178: The Green Scorpion Palace</h1><p>Qin Sang looked down into the deep pit.  The bottom was shrouded in a thick, poisonous fog, obscuring everything in a hazy blur; no palace was visible.</p><p>The fluctuations from the battle were subtle, masked by the fog, but they were out of sync with the surrounding environment, easily discernible.  Whether it was an internal conflict within the Gou tribe, or the Green Scorpion Palace being breached, attracting others to vie for the opportunity, it was a perfect chance for them.</p><p>They silently guessed at the identities of the combatants, remaining cautious.  After some time, the battle didn't end; instead, it intensified, seeming evenly matched, neither side gaining an advantage. Qin Sang decided to investigate.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had roughly ascertained the toxicity of the fog and devised a countermeasure.  He spread his palms, a wisp of fog in each. The fog condensed into two small red snakes, writhing in his hands, but confined to that small space, unable to escape.</p><p>The two red snakes hissed, coiling and uncoiling, their bodies twisting into various shapes—some knotting, some forming intricate patterns—changing rapidly, morphing into hundreds of different forms in an instant.  These patterns possessed a unique charm, consistent throughout; to a cultivator, they resembled strange runes.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang clapped his hands together. The two red snakes burst within his grasp, dissipating back into a larger cloud of fog.  Qin Sang was enveloped in the fog, identical to the surrounding mist, but altered by his secret technique.</p><p>The fog swirled, spontaneously expanding, coalescing into a red protective aura around Qin Sang.</p><p>“This is the Myriad Source Barrier.  Come in, Miss. The barrier will help us resist the outside fog…”</p><p>Qin Sang gestured for Liuli to approach.</p><p>The Myriad Source Barrier was a superior technique from the *Poison God Canon*, offering protection against poison, but Qin Sang hadn't been able to use it before due to possessing the Poison Pearl.  Knowing this technique, even encountering an unfamiliar poison, with a little understanding of its toxicity, he could refine it into the Myriad Source Barrier, using its own nature against itself.</p><p>All poisons in the world, though diverse in origin,  could be integrated under this single method.  A poison cultivator needed to understand all poisons, to apply their knowledge to unfamiliar ones and combine that with various techniques.  Inability to even slightly analyze a poison's toxicity is rare, making this technique highly practical.</p><p>The Myriad Source Barrier couldn't completely isolate them from the external fog, but it would mitigate some of the toxicity, making things easier.</p><p>Liuli readily complied, stepping inside the aura.  She felt immediate relief and nodded to Qin Sang, indicating her readiness.</p><p>Qin Sang made a hand gesture, the Myriad Source Barrier rippled slightly, merging them seamlessly with the fog.  Then, they jumped into the pit.</p><p>Upon entering, the toxicity of the fog intensified, but protected by the barrier, they remained composed.</p><p>They descended slowly, cautiously, the battle's fluctuations becoming increasingly clear.</p><p>Even after descending a significant distance, they still hadn't seen the palace, but Qin Sang had located the battlefield.</p><p>Approaching more cautiously, Qin Sang activated his celestial eye, finally discerning the scene.</p><p>Unexpectedly, only one person fought on each side.</p><p>One combatant was strangely shaped, with a protruding chest resembling a pigeon breast, a long, slender, and agile tail, perfectly matching the descriptions of the Gou tribe.  The texts also mentioned short wings; looking at the individual's back, Qin Sang noticed a bulge under the wide robe, further confirming this was a Gou cultivator.</p><p>Behind this person, shadowy snakes writhed, nine in total—one being their tail, the other eight formed from the poisonous fog, their tails connected to the cultivator’s base.  The nine snakes fanned out behind them like a sinister halo, menacingly eyeing their opponent.</p><p>The other combatant was even more surprising—a young man in white robes, with fair features and a somewhat effeminate air. His weapon was a small, double-eared, round iron cauldron, only slightly larger than a fist, spinning ceaselessly around him.  A wisp of white smoke rose from the cauldron, swirling around the young man, shielding him from the poisonous fog.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the young man for a moment, confirming his identity: a human cultivator!</p><p>“Hiss… hiss…”</p><p>The Gou cultivator’s shadowy snakes writhed, hissing, and lunged.</p><p>A viper, incredibly swift, produced nine intertwining, shifting shadows, instantly multiplying into thousands, forming a dense network of snakes, making it impossible to distinguish real from illusion.  Its movements drew Qin Sang's attention; amidst the swirling serpents, Qin Sang sensed a second, underlying transformation within the poisonous mist.</p><p>"Is this the Bixi Palace's restriction?"</p><p>The thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  The Xiehou tribe were indeed the masters of the Bixi Palace, able to utilize its power.</p><p>But where were the other Xiehou cultivators?</p><p>While not a major clan, the Xiehou tribe certainly wouldn't only have one Void Realm Double cultivator. Yet, only one was present.  Furthermore, this cultivator was merely at the initial stage of Void Realm Double, facing a white-robed youth who was only a Nascent Soul Mid-stage cultivator.</p><p>The Xiehou tribe couldn't be this weak. Either the others were injured in the radiant light and forced to leave the sacred ground; or they had more pressing matters and chose to leave one behind to stall the white-robed youth.</p><p>Empowered by the poisonous mist and the ancient palace's restriction, this Xiehou cultivator displayed strength exceeding their cultivation level.</p><p>Qin Sang watched, wondering how the white-robed youth would respond. The youth found himself ensnared in the serpent net, under the gaze of countless snake heads, yet remained remarkably calm.</p><p>"Humph!"</p><p>The white-robed youth sneered. "That trick again! If that's all you've got, I suggest you leave. Rejoin your clan leader; perhaps you'll break these ancient restrictions faster that way."</p><p>The Xiehou cultivator ignored him. Thousands of snake heads opened, spewing crimson poisonous smoke that morphed into grotesque, laughing faces, lunging towards the white-robed youth.</p><p>The faces vanished upon contact with the white smoke surrounding the youth, seeming ephemeral, dissolving into a subtle, intangible force that pierced the smoke.</p><p>Clearly, the white-robed youth wasn't encountering this for the first time.  Unfazed, he formed his fingers into a sword, directing a hand seal towards a circular cauldron.</p><p>'Ding-ling-ling...'</p><p>The cauldron clanged. The white smoke from its mouth abruptly ceased, then the cauldron transformed into a streak of light, impossibly fast, like teleportation, instantly creating countless images of itself within the white smoke.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly saw the poisonous mist's laughing faces being sucked into the cauldrons, rendering the Xiehou cultivator's carefully planned attack ineffective.</p><p>"Even if he isn't a poison cultivator, his mastery of poison arts must be quite profound..."</p><p>Qin Sang concluded, secretly channeling his true essence to project the battle scene to Liuli.  "Can you discern this person's background, my lady?"</p><p>Liuli observed the white-robed youth, then shook her head slightly. "He doesn't seem to be a disciple of those major sects."</p><p>The Yi people had ties with the Xun and Kan states.  It wasn't strange for other human cultivators to gain entry to the sacred ground.  Since he wasn't from those major sects, he wasn't an immediate threat.  If necessary, Qin Sang wouldn't mind eliminating a competitor.</p><p>For now, it was better to watch, letting the white-robed youth draw the Xiehou tribe's attention while they infiltrated.</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the battlefield below.  The palace remained unseen, but the Xiehou cultivator's manipulation of the restrictions had revealed its location. The problem was the two combatants blocking their path.</p><p>Liuli pointed upwards. Qin Sang nodded, understanding her suggestion to utilize the radiant light.  Before entering, they'd observed the radiant light surging around the Bixi Palace. Its expansion would inevitably impact and shake the palace.</p><p>They waited. Soon, a violent tremor struck.  The two combatants seemed oblivious, the chaos of swirling poison mist and their divine techniques masking the disturbance.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Seeing their chance, Qin Sang and Liuli moved, skirting the edge of the battle, swiftly arriving before a large hall.</p><p>A red mist hinted at a green glow within.</p><p>The hall's structure resembled those outside, sealed by formations, but the power here was far stronger, though severely damaged, riddled with cracks, its roof half-collapsed.</p><p>Through the breaches, they saw the interior was empty; its treasures already taken.</p><p>Despite the numerous weaknesses in the formations, Qin Sang and Liuli remained cautious, carefully slipping through a crack without disturbing anyone.</p><p>"Qin Daoist?"</p><p>Liuli looked to Qin Sang expectantly.</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed his palm, sensing for a moment, then shook his head slightly.</p><p>The palm print yielded no response, failing to detect the Thunder Hall.  They had to press deeper.</p><p>Rounding the main hall, they found a fractured section of ground, where the power of the formation created a chaotic storm. The earth was tilted; the ancient Bi Xie Palace seemed to have crashed down at an angle, with the hall at the poison-sting point lying at the bottom.</p><p>The power here was too chaotic; a stealthy passage was far from easy. Even with the Sky-Eyed Butterfly assisting, Qin Sang had to carefully consider their next move.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang found a path through the storm.  Just as they were about to proceed, Qin Sang frowned, turning to the stairs on their right.</p><p>These were the stairs behind the hall.  In the crevices of the steps, a herb had sprouted—unnoticed until now.  It grew rapidly before their eyes, unfolding its umbrella-like top to reveal a tiny figure, no bigger than a fingernail, arms akimbo, glaring at them.</p><p>“I’m helping you two distract the master of this place, allowing you entry.  Aren’t you going to thank me before you leave?”</p><p>It was the voice of the young man in white robes.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were quite surprised. They had thought they were well-hidden.</p><p>He remained composed, offering a slight smile.  “We didn’t expect your perception to be so acute, friend. We merely saw you engaged in a fierce battle and didn’t wish to disturb you.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>The young man in white robes noticed their identities, exclaiming in surprise, “You two are both human cultivators?”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t deny it, observing this person’s intentions in revealing their presence.</p><p>“Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!”</p><p>The little man clapped his hands and laughed.  “I’ve been struggling, as an outsider, to fit in with the alien races, unable to find allies. Yet here I unexpectedly meet fellow human cultivators! You two are surely here for the treasures within the Bi Xie Palace, yes?”</p><p>“What treasures are in this ancient palace?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s question stunned the little man.</p><p>Frowning and glaring at Qin Sang, he demanded, “You don’t know what treasures are inside, and you came here for what?”</p><p>“We have our own business here, and it’s not treasure hunting. The treasures left by the Xie Gou ancestors for their people are hardly suitable for us outsiders, and we have no interest in them. If you’re here for the treasures, there should be no conflict between us. We certainly won’t side with the Xie Gou; let’s just go our separate ways, and not interfere with each other!” Qin Sang stated truthfully.</p><p>Hearing this, the little man looked unconvinced, his gaze falling upon the Myriad Source Barrier.  “You seem to be proficient in the way of poison, friend, yet you say you aren’t here for treasures. Do you think anyone will believe you?”</p><p>“Whether you believe me or not is up to you,” Qin Sang said calmly, unwilling to say more, and gestured to Liuli to leave.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The little man quickly stopped them, his gaze sweeping across their faces, seemingly trying to discern whether Qin Sang was being genuine or deceptive.</p><p>It was unclear how he reasoned, but after a moment's hesitation, he said, “The Xie Gou treasures may not appeal to you two, but what if I said there's a greater opportunity inside?”</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a glance, and chuckled.  “Would you reveal this opportunity to us, friend? Or even give it to us?”</p><p>“I certainly won’t give it to you! My goal is to use you to drive back the Xie Gou. After that, it’s every cultivator for themselves.”</p><p>The little man was very frank. “You’ve both seen the situation. I’m alone, and I can barely get past the gatekeeper. The Xie Gou clan leader inside is even more powerful, able to manipulate even more of the formation’s power. They are much harder to deal with.  I originally had no chance, but by allying with you two, there might be a slight possibility.”</p><p>Pausing, he continued, “You must have both noticed the changes in the celestial phenomena outside. What are your thoughts?”</p><p>“We’re both first-time visitors to the Sacred Land, and we’re clueless about the changes,” Qin Sang said with interest. “You seem to know something?”</p><p>“I don’t know any more than you two,” the little man shook his head, then his tone changed.  “However, I heard a legend from an alien race, a prophecy concerning the Sacred Land.”</p><p>Having piqued Qin Sang and Liuli’s curiosity, the young man in white robes didn't keep them waiting, continuing, “The cultivator who told me about this mentioned it in jest, and even he didn’t believe the prophecy. It says that the day the Sacred Land is destroyed will be the beginning of the great rise of the alien races.  A great opportunity will descend, and the ancestral guides left in the Sacred Land will awaken. Look at the scene outside—isn’t it a sign of the Sacred Land’s destruction? If the Xie Gou ancestors really left behind guidance, it must be here!”</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a look, both finding the legend rather absurd.</p><p>If even the Sacred Land was destroyed, how could the alien races rise?</p><p>“Friend, you should deal with the gatekeeper first,” Qin Sang said calmly, and turned to leave.</p>
