Qilong Island.
The island stretches out into the water like the shape of a dragon lying down on its stomach, hence its name.
The island isn’t very big, but it’s灵气 is very rich. It’s a glorious cavern-dwelling and was already quite famous before it was occupied by the Liu brothers. Qilong Island’s fame grew even more afterward.
The Liu brothers practiced the same technique and were very gifted at it. They managed to break through to the 13th refinement stage at a young age. If they were lucky, they may have the chance to build a foundation.
When they were in the refinement stage, they could already handle the foundation stage cultivator together. If they managed to build a foundation, they would have become even stronger and were well known through the scattered cultivators. No one was willing to provoke them.
The people living on Qilong Island were part of the Liu family. They lived a peaceful and worry-free life under the protection of the Liu brothers. However, after the Liu brother’s died, their peace came to an end.
On that clear morning, the always reliable housekeeper of the Liu family suddenly rushed into the inner house, stumbled and almost fell over from the threshold, completely unmindful of his embarrassing appearance.
Lady Liu heard the commotion and came out of her room with her eyebrows tightly knitted, somewhat disgruntled as she questioned, “What urgent matter is there that has made you act this hastily, Uncle Wu?”
“Lady Liu, disaster has struck! Disaster has struck! “
Uncle Wu rushed to Lady Liu’s side and whispered a few words in her ear.
Lady Liu’s expression changed drastically, and she exclaimed in shock, “Are you certain?”
Uncle Wu looked as if he was mourning for his parents. “The two masters… are in the ancestral hall!”
...
Hidden in the shadows, Qin Sang did not reveal himself. He watched as the Liu family discovered the Liu brothers’ bodies and calmly walked away, Since the Liu family had lost its pillar of support, their future was none of his concern.
He left the marketplace after asking Shopkeeper Wu to help him find the ghost carving feather and craft a spirit devouring cone. He needed to deal with the aftermath of his trip and would have to go to Mingqin Island to bury his Senior Sister Qinting and her husband. He was going to pass by Qilong Island along the way and would return the Liu brothers’ bodies at the same time.
He traveled south for over ten days before finally finding an unimpressive little island in the area that Senior Sister Qinting had mentioned. The Liu family was in disarray, but Qin Sang did not spare them another thought.
Mingqin Island was named by Senior Sister and her husband and was not a well-known island. The island was shaped like a mountain with no special features. It wasn’t particularly graceful either. Only the sheer cliff on the east side that met the water was striking.
On the cliff was an enormous image or rather statue carved out of a sword.
A man and woman were lovingly embracing each other, looking east, and could watch the dawn’s morning light every day.
The statue had been carved for quite some time and was somewhat weather-beaten. However, it was obvious that the carvings depicted Senior Brother Jiang and Senior Sister Qinting.
There was a stone room next to the statue with a few simple daily necessities inside.
Qin Sang could imagine that Senior Sister Qinting’s spirit energy was growing increasingly weak and to find a way to heal Senior Brother Jiang, she had been rushing around the Immortal Cultivation world begging for help. She held on tightly to even the slightest hope and did not dare to slack off in the least.
She could only be truly relaxed when she returned to this place, watched the sunrise, and recalled the sweetness of the past, allowing a genuine smile to appear on her face.
Truly, it is incomprehensible.
Qin Sang let out a light sigh and used his sword to dig a tomb beneath the statue where he then buried Senior Sister and her husband. He erected a stone tablet and had originally planned on writing an epitaph but stopped himself. Instead, he simply carved ‘Combined Tomb of Jiang Yi and Qinting’. He then set up a few prepared defense mechanisms.
The two small formations were a glamour and a protective enchantment.
Qin Sang should have left immediately, but he stood there for a long while, gazing at the statue. Memories he had long since forgotten unexpectedly came flooding back.
After entering this world, the only woman he respected was the Princess of Dongyang. The Princess of Dongyang had once said that they were similar people; both were seeking a glimmer of hope from the impossible. And they would continue to do so no matter the obstacles in their path. Perhaps this was why Qin Sang held her in such high esteem.
Unfortunately, even though they respected each other, their aspirations were different. He wholeheartedly sought the Dao while the Princess of Dongyang firmly pursued the highest seat of power.
What if he had chosen to remain with her at that time?
Would living a life of wealth and happiness with harmony and kinship have been more meaningful than pursuing the ethereal long life?
Throughout the ages, countless Primordial Spirit cultivators in the small cold domain have died, and not one of them succeeded in breaking through to the realm of the split spirit, let alone becoming immortals.
Qin Sang’s eyes briefly flickered with hesitation before he suddenly regained his composure and shook his head fiercely. He then firmly looked east.
There, the morning sun rises and red clouds filled the sky.
No ifs or buts!
He had chosen his path and would resolutely continue walking it, even if it meant death or the end of the Dao.

Qin Sang watched the sunrise with the Qingting couple, and then he left.

……

After returning to the cave府, Qin Sang sorted all the spoils he got from the cave. He kept the handy ones for his own use, and looked for a chance to sell those he couldn’t use.

After several life-or-death fights in the cave, Qin Sang made progress with his cultivation method. However, he didn’t rush to practice. Instead, he prepared to do a thorough study of “The Heavenly Corpse Scripture” to try to guarantee the success of his first attempt in making a fierce corpse.

Five days later, Qin Sang opened his eyes and nodded slightly.

He currently only had the body of the White Cloud hermit. He didn’t have any living Foundation Establishment cultivators, and he didn’t need a Corpse Talisman to make the normal kind of fierce corpse. All he needed to do was to gather the necessary spiritual materials, make it carefully, and the only thing he needed to worry about was the very dangerous Earth Fiend’s energy. If he wasn’t careful, he could destroy the fierce corpse and hurt himself.

Of course, Qin Sang wasn’t deterred by this danger at all. The White Cloud hermit was almost about to break through to the mid-Foundation Establishment realm. A fierce corpse made from him wouldn’t be weak and could be a good helper for him in the future.

The fierce corpses Qin Sang had encountered in the cave didn’t seem too hard to deal with, but they were uncontrolled fierce corpses. They didn’t have any intelligence or anyone controlling them, and they only acted on instinct to kill and crave blood. If someone was controlling them, the fierce corpses would instantly become completely different. They would have very tough bodies, be contagious with corpse poison, not be afraid of pain or death, and could be great if they were used well.

Even if they were only used to entangle the enemy and delay them so that the Ten Directions Yama Formation could be prepared, it would still be worth it.

Today was the day Boss Wu had agreed to deliver the goods, so Qin Sang sealed the cave府 and flew on his sword to Huilong Temple. There was no new voice talisman from Grandma Jing, and she hadn’t sent any news either.

When he arrived at Boss Wu’s shop, Qin Sang saw what he wanted: ten Ghost Eagle Arrows and two Soul-Eating Awls!

Ghost Eagle Arrows looked like the legendary feathers of a black phoenix, and on the feathers was a huge, eye-shaped pattern. The “eyeball” in the middle of the “eye” was extremely black and was actually a ball of black flames. This was a strange type of Yin fire.

Boss Wu had ordered six Ghost Eagle Arrows per Qin Sang’s request. It was very expensive to ship them in such a short time.

Qin Sang paid for the Soul-Eating Awls at the same time.

Including buying the Nine-Aperture Stones and Dark Sky Gold at Treasure Pagoda Peak previously, he ended up spending more than eight hundred low-grade spirit stones. Of course, this had to do with him worrying about the future and preparing multiple sets of five elements Yin objects.
