<h1>**Chapter 306 Separation**</h1><p>**Chapter 306 Separation**</p><p>The Hook Snake was unexpectedly assaulting the barrier.</p><p>The commotion was not great at the moment, but as the Hook Snake continued to attack, the barrier’s fluctuations would become increasingly violent. It was possible that the Hook Snake would break the barrier, attracting others’ attention. At that time, the secrets hidden in the palace would be revealed to the world.</p><p>When they entered, they discovered that the spirit medicines inside had already been taken, and the lingering auras of Yu Kong and the others who had died were still present...</p><p>Luo Xingnan immediately turned around and left.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, afraid to stay there and heal, got up from the ground, quickly brushing away bloodstains on his body.</p><p>Qin Sang wiped out the lingering auras in the palace, activated the barrier to stall for time, disguised himself in a normal fashion, and flew down the mountain. Soon, he arrived at the entrance to the protection array formation, fortunate to have not alerted anyone along the way.</p><p>Several Lingbao Pavilions were not peaceful, and there were occasional battles.</p><p>Nobody had yet noticed the abnormalities in the Worship Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang and Luo Xingnan’s eyes met, and they almost simultaneously entered the protection array formation.</p><p>It was still the same wind array as before. Both Shangguan Lifeng and Qin Sang were familiar with how the wind array worked. Before the wind array’s could fully unleash its force, they had already easily found the wind cave that was the exit.</p><p>“What are Your Excellency’s plans after you leave?”</p><p>As Qin Sang flew towards the wind cave, he asked the White-robed Scholar beside him.</p><p>The White-robed Scholar understood what Qin Sang wanted to ask. He hesitated for a moment before saying, “I am accustomed to being alone, so I will not travel with the fellow Daoists. I will bid you farewell now.”</p><p>This answer was beyond Qin Sang’s expectations. He had not thought that under Luo Xingnan’s watchful gaze, the White-robed Scholar would choose to travel alone.</p><p>Unless...this person was certain that he could escape Luo Xingnan’s pursuit.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that Traveling Monk had mentioned that the White-robed Scholar’s escape technique was excellent. It seemed that there was something behind it.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned in silence. Shangguan Lifeng asked in a deep voice, “Are you not afraid of Luo Xingnan killing and stealing the treasures? His character is as you’ve seen it with your own eyes. Can you really believe that he will let it rest here? If we do not join hands in resistance at this time, won’t we be at his mercy?”</p><p>The White-robed Scholar asked in return, “Join hands in resistance? How then do we resist? The Gold Ring Array has been destroyed, and Daoist Master has exhausted his strength. Daoist Friend Shangguan is seriously injured and had no time to heal. Even now, can he still manage a blade or two? I am not skilled in combat, and even with Daoist Master Qingfeng, we would still be at others’ mercy.”</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng was stunned. “Luo Xingnan is also wounded, and Daoist Master Qingfeng has the符宝...”</p><p>“Luo Xingnan also has 符宝.”</p><p>The White-robed Scholar sighed softly and said, “I have a question. I wonder if I should say it or not...if you do not have confidence in escaping this person, you should carefully consider your choices. Of course, aside from surrendering to Luo Xingnan, there may be other ways. There are no shortage of Foundation Building Ninth Layer masters in the cave府s now. You can always find someone to take refuge with...”</p><p>As he spoke, the wind cave appeared within their sights. Wind vortexes were forming all around them.</p><p>“I will say no more. I bid you farewell.”</p><p>The White-robed Scholar cupped his hands and abruptly accelerated. He was the first to jump into the wind cave.</p><p>Outside Qiuhong Market City.</p><p>The remains of Cloud Beasts could be seen scattered on the ground, but there was not a single person in sight. Everyone was scavenging for treasures in the cave府s.</p><p>A ray of escape light emerged from a cave. It was the White-robed Scholar. His body technique was relentless. He took out a spirit talisman from his mustard seed bag and activated his spiritual power to pat it gently.</p><p>The spirit talisman shattered, and a clear wind flew out from it, landing on the White-robed Scholar’s body.</p><p>Then, a pair of azure wings appeared on his back.</p><p>The wings flapped gently, and the White-robed Scholar’s speed suddenly increased tremendously. It was slightly faster than the speed Luo Xingnan had displayed earlier.</p><p>However, before the White-robed Scholar could fly very far, a dazzling meteor-like escape light suddenly zoomed past him, directly surpassing him at an astonishing speed.</p><p>In the escape light was a bamboo raft.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had not been idle either. He had been holding onto spirit stones the entire time, and no one knew how many spirit medicines he had swallowed. His spiritual power had already mostly recovered, and he could sustain the spirit bamboo raft for a while.</p><p>Unfortunately, it would not be for very long.</p><p>The White-robed Scholar was dumbfounded. He had seen Traveling Monk use a spirit bamboo raft, but at that time, its speed was only slightly faster than a Foundation Building First Layer cultivator’s. He had never expected that the speed of a spirit bamboo raft could be so astonishing when it was operating at its full potential.</p><p>Then, the White-robed Scholar suddenly realized something, and his expression changed drastically. He abruptly patted his mustard seed bag, and a small incense burner, only about the size of a palm, flew out of it.</p><p>The bronze-colored incense burner was coiled with a dragon sculpture. There were three dragon heads on top of the incense burner, from which light smoke drifted out.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>The White-robed Scholar opened his mouth and sprayed a large mouthful of his essence blood onto the incense burner.</p><p>Essence and blood fell onto the incense burner. It devoured them all, and turned a layer of bloody color. The smoke poured out like water, twisted in the air, and there was a sound of a dragon’s roar.</p><p>The three carved dragons on the incense burner seemed to be coming alive.</p><p>The white-dressed Confucian scholar lost his essence and blood, his face turned pale suddenly, and there was a gleam of pain in his eyes. He spat the word with gritted teeth, “Blast!”</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The incense burner broke into pieces.</p><p>All the smoke inside poured out and transformed into a giant dragon.</p><p>Just at that time, Luo Xingnan appeared quietly, the Yin-Yang diagram on his Luo Pan spun, and the white light shot out. As it was about to fall on the white-dressed Confucian scholar, the dragon-shaped smoke let out a silent roar, its body suddenly swung and broke the white light, so that the white-dressed Confucian scholar avoided the fate of being caught by the Yin-Yang Luo Pan.</p><p>Then, the dragon-shaped smoke dashed straight for Luo Xingnan under the control of the white-dressed Confucian scholar.</p><p>Whereas the white-dressed Confucian scholar didn't even look at the result, he vibrated his wings and flew towards the opposite direction from Qin Sang and the other people.</p><p>When Luo Xingnan crushed the smoke, the spirit bamboo and the white-dressed Confucian scholar had already escaped for a distance, and they headed off in different directions.</p><p>Luo Xingnan looked gloomy, but he didn't hesitate for too long, so he chose to give up on the white-dressed Confucian scholar, exerted his speed to the limit, and went after the spirit bamboo.</p><p>Although he couldn't chase them for the moment, Luo Xingnan was not in a hurry at all, the place was empty, only needed to be a distance away in the back, it was enough, he didn't believe that Qin Sang could keep such a fast speed while bringing two injured people.</p><p>As expected, it wasn’t long after, the spirit bamboo flying boat flying in the distant sky suddenly lost its light and swung a little, seemed very difficult to keep going, then changed the direction, and swooped down into a mountain.</p><p>Obviously, it was a sign of running out of spiritual force for the person using the magic weapon.</p><p>Luo Xingnan’s eyes lit up, and he chased after it without any hesitation.</p><p>The mountain peaks here were very steep and rugged.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped the light technique, scanned the place, and saw a cave. He recalled the spirit bamboo flying boat and asked Shangguan Lifeng, “Daoist Shangguan, are you willing to take action against Luo Xingnan?”</p><p>“This person helped me revenge my murdered master, so I’ve carried out the agreement and returned his favor, but then this person sold me out, so let’s just forget about everything.”</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng said without any hesitation, loud and clear.</p><p>“Daoist took me to escape together, and didn’t abandon me. I’m very grateful for the life-saving grace! If there’s anything I can do, just let me know. Even though I’m weak, I’ll give it everything I got!”</p>
