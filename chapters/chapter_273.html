<h1>Chapter 266: Body-Severing Puppet Secret Technique</h1><p>Elder Di Que collected so many spirit materials in order to repair the Yin Ring and refine the Yang Ring. However, he was still missing a few items, so he couldn’t complete the refinement.</p><p>If Elder Di Que had one more Primordial Twin Rings today, the outcome may have been different.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t use magic treasures right now, and he lacked the ability to gather the necessary spirit materials, so the Primordial Twin Rings were of no use to him at the moment. He put away the Yin Ring and spirit materials, preparing to study them after he formed his golden core.</p><p>Then, his gaze fell on the bottle of Vermillion Gold Fire Liquid.</p><p>No wonder Elder Di Que was so excited. The jade slip contained a description of this object.</p><p>The Vermillion Gold Vine absorbed the gold spiritual energy of heaven and earth to form fruits that were a type of unrefined Vermillion Gold Fire Liquid. If these fruits were given to a tool refiner, the refiner could melt the golden rind and the pulp inside together to obtain true Vermillion Gold Fire Liquid.</p><p>Vermillion Gold Fire Liquid was a type of refined metal used to refine tools, not a spirit medicine.</p><p>However, one of the previous elders of the Spirit Controlling Sect had once obtained an ancient beast controlling secret manual from the ruins of an ancient cultivator. They had discovered that if the fruits of the Vermillion Gold Vine weren’t refined, and only the pulp was used to feed spirit insects, there was a chance that it could help the spirit insects undergo a metamorphosis!</p><p>To ordinary cultivators, the fruits of the Vermillion Gold Vine only had one use: refining tools.</p><p>But to the Spirit Controlling Sect cultivators who were skilled in controlling beasts, the fruits of the Vermillion Gold Vine were absolutely the most precious treasure.</p><p>Raising strange insects could be done using spirit medicines to rapidly increase their strength, but the biggest difficulty was that the cultivators had no way to control the insects’ metamorphosis.</p><p>This was like human cultivators who could never reach the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Their master may have died of old age, but the strange insect had yet to undergo its first metamorphosis. This was undoubtedly a sad thing.</p><p>The abilities of strange insects were strange and unpredictable. A strange insect that had undergone metamorphosis would definitely be a great help. Cultivating a powerful strange insect may be even more useful than a magic treasure. If someone offered to trade magic treasures with you, you would not be willing to do so.</p><p>Although the fruits of the Vermillion Gold Vine could not help strange insects undergo metamorphosis with 100% certainty, they could still give cultivators hope for metamorphosis. This was also why Elder Di Que valued this object so much.</p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Vermillion Gold Fire Liquid before his eyes, examining it carefully. His heart sighed repeatedly.</p><p>In order to obtain the Heart-Eating Insect, Elder Di Que lay in ambush outside of the Fiend Dominating Sect for thirty years. He had certainly put his heart into collecting many strange insects. Unfortunately, QIn Sang hadn’t been able to snatch Elder Di Que’s spirit beast pouch during that hasty moment. He didn’t know if it had been destroyed by the Skyfiend Saber Talisman or if it had fallen into the lava.</p><p>With the talent he possessed, there was still much that Qin Sang needed to accomplish in his cultivation. It would be difficult to spare any time to search for strange insects before he formed his golden core.</p><p>The Vermillion Gold Fire Liquid had landed in his hands, but it was like a pearl that had been cast to a blind person.</p><p>This also included the Primordial Twin Rings. They also needed the assistance of spirit beasts to be used.</p><p>“It all depends on whether or not I have the luck to encounter strange insects in the future.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head gently, putting away the Vermillion Gold Fire Liquid and the jade slips. The jade slips had detailed descriptions of various strange insects, so he wouldn’t be afraid to not recognize them if he did encounter any in the future.</p><p>He continued to examine the other jade slips, which contained techniques passed down by various sects. It seemed that many people had met their ends at the hands of Elder Di Que.</p><p>All of the techniques that had been collected by Elder Di Que were of excellent quality, but they were useless to Qin Sang. He put them away casually.</p><p>When he saw the final jade slip, Qin Sang suddenly let out a soft gasp.</p><p>The jade slip actually contained a secret technique called the Body-Severing Puppet Secret Technique.</p><p>This secret technique could be used without using spiritual energy or divine sense. The technique required the user to sacrifice one of their limbs, which would then be transformed into a puppet that resembled a clone.</p><p>This puppet could exist for ten breaths of time. Aside from not having the same strength, in terms of appearance and aura, it was exactly identical to the original body. There were no differences whatsoever.</p><p>Moreover, when the puppet was created, one could transfer the aura of others that had been locked onto the body to the puppet. This would allow one to use the puppet as a scapegoat, allowing the user to escape like a cicada shedding its gold shell.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the severed arm that had been blown away by the Skyfiend Saber Talisman. Elder Di Que must have used this secret technique to escape.</p><p>The Body-Severing Puppet Secret Technique was a peculiar secret technique. If it were used properly, it could be used to avoid many deadly dangers.</p><p>However, the代价 of the secret technique was not as simple as losing a limb. Once a limb had been severed, it would be incredibly difficult to recover. This was evident from Elder Di Que’s title. Qin Sang prudently put away the jade slip. He wouldn’t use it unless he was forced to.</p><p>The last item was a metal sheet.</p><p>Qin Sang held it in his hand and sensed it for a moment. He discovered that it was actually a bone fragment, but this bone fragment was as hard as black iron. This was also an object similar to a jade slip that contained a demonic cultivation technique called the Heavenly Demon Melody.</p><p>The so-called Myriad Illusions Divine Melody was actually the Heavenly Demon Melody. Elder Di Que had disguised it by giving it a different name.</p><p>This cultivation method is not simple. It not only points directly to the great path of Distraction, but also preserves an unusually complete inheritance. There are more than ten magic incantations accompanying the cultivation method and each magic incantation is extremely powerful.</p><p>To use "All Heaven Demon Sound" as the foundation, it was enough to establish a sect and start a school.</p><p>It is estimated that the Earth Deficiency elder obtained it from the ruins of a certain ancient sect. Otherwise, it would not be so complete.</p><p>Before the Core Formation stage, Qin Sang could not change his cultivation of other methods. But this Demonic Art was good at the way of Demonic Sound and was strange and unpredictable. It was perfect to use as a backup cultivation method after Core Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully read it over once, including the magic incantations accompanying the cultivation method.</p><p>Some of these magic incantations had to be cultivated in conjunction with the "All Heaven Demon Sound." Others did not. You could also use them by using spiritual force to simulate the power of the Demonic Sound, but the power would be weaker.</p><p>One of the magic incantations was called "Soul Snatching Incantation." After reading the effects of this magic incantation, Qin Sang immediately decided that he must cultivate it.</p><p>Soul Snatching Incantation was not a magic incantation used against enemies. It instead relied on the power of the Demonic Sound to impact the opponent's mind. You could take advantage of when the opponent was impacted by the Demonic Sound and their mind was in a trance to interrogate them.</p><p>The other party would unknowingly tell all their secrets.</p><p>However, there were also restrictions on this magic incantation.</p><p>First, the strength of the person who was affected must not be much stronger than the caster. You also had to first restrain the other party. This was because casting the magic incantation required some preparation. You could only succeed by casting it on the other party's body.</p><p>Moreover, as time passed, the effects of the Soul Snatching Incantation would slowly weaken until the affected person broke free. If the affected person's will was extremely firm, the time that the Soul Snatching Incantation would affect them might be very short.</p><p>Second, the Soul Snatching Incantation could only be used once on each person. This was because after someone was affected once, their primordial spirit would be on guard, and it would be difficult to succeed again.</p><p>The Soul Snatching Incantation and a forbidden technique, the "Soul Searching Technique" were similar. However, the Soul Searching Technique was much more vicious. Not only would the person affected by the Soul Searching Technique experience unbearable pain, their primordial spirit would also shatter and die after they were searched.</p><p>Moreover, the other party would perceive it as soon as the Soul Searching Technique was used. If the other party was strong enough, they could detonate their primordial spirit and counterattack the caster.</p><p>There were also many cultivation methods that could avoid the effects of the Soul Searching Technique.</p><p>The Soul Snatching Incantation did not have these disadvantages. It did not fear a counterattack.</p><p>Qin Sang thought in secret that it was probably because of this magic incantation that the Earth Deficiency elder had dared to act against Daoist Xuanyu.</p><p>The Earth Deficiency elder had forced Daoist Xuanyu to burn his Golden Core and finally restrain his primordial spirit. Even if he didn't obtain the Profound Metal True Talisman, he could still interrogate the method to refine it and he wouldn't fear returning empty-handed.</p>
