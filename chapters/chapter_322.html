<h1>Chapter 315: Ambush and Assassination</h1><p>After resting for a while, Qin Sang left the Changyang Market and flew towards the Tianjing Secret Realm.</p><p>Endless and undulating mountains surrounded the market. They were a complete wasteland, and Qin Sang was very familiar with the environment. He had even done a few ‘businesses’ here.</p><p>After leaving the Changyang Market, Qin Sang first concealed his figure and vigilantly observed his surroundings. He wanted to make sure that no one was following or peeping at him.</p><p>However, being cautious in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield never hurt.</p><p>He activated the gray robe he was wearing, and a hazy aura enveloped him. This was a high-grade defensive magic weapon he had found in Luo Xingnan's mustard seed bag.</p><p>Together with the Corpse Puppet and Ebony Sword, which he could release at any time, he could handle emergencies.</p><p>He then turned into a遁光 and flew towards the Tianjing Secret Realm.</p><p>Just when Qin Sang was about to fly out of the mountains and was passing between two peaks, he suddenly felt a sense of unease.</p><p>This feeling came very suddenly and strongly!</p><p>Before Qin Sang could figure out why, a clap of thunder suddenly burst from the sky above him.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure came to an abrupt halt.</p><p>At this moment, the ground shook violently, as if an ancient thunder beast that had been sleeping here had been awakened by Qin Sang's disturbance. It let out a deafening roar.</p><p>Along with this thunderclap, Qin Sang felt an unusually terrifying aura appear above his head. It firmly locked onto him, and his heart turned cold as his hair stood on end.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly looked up.</p><p>His vision was filled with dazzling lightning. At the center of the lightning, a yellow spirit talisman hung in the air.</p><p>The talisman cracked with a ‘pop’, and a deep and bottomless whirlpool immediately formed. It hung upside down in the sky, with wild winds, rumbling thunder, and dancing lightning.</p><p>In an instant, the sky changed color.</p><p>The aura that locked onto Qin Sang and made him panic came from the whirlpool. Then, countless bolts of lightning suddenly shot out of the whirlpool, gathering in one place facing Qin Sang.</p><p>A gigantic beam of light descended from the sky!</p><p>This beam of light carried an extremely destructive aura. Even though Qin Sang had broken through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, he would never dare to withstand this force with his physical body.</p><p>Who?</p><p>Why?</p><p>He had very few enemies, or rather, very few living enemies.</p><p>Even when he was fishing in the Changyang Market, he was very cautious in choosing his targets. They were all wandering thieves, and every time he made a move, he cleaned up the mess very cleanly. It was impossible to leave any trace.</p><p>Could it be that the other party had set up an ambush here and randomly picked a target, waiting for a fat sheep to fall into their trap? And he was just unlucky enough to walk into it?</p><p>That's even more absurd!</p><p>The mountains were so vast, and the Tianjing Secret Realm was so remote. Setting a trap here, it might take a long time to catch anyone. The efficiency would be too low.</p><p>The spell sealed in this spirit talisman was very powerful, and it was very valuable.</p><p>They didn't even know who the fat sheep was, so how could they use such a spirit talisman? Weren't they afraid of making a loss?</p><p>Moreover, he had deliberately taken a detour to make sure that no one was following him before heading straight for the Tianjing Secret Realm. How could it be so coincidental?</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were filled with shock as the light shone upon him.</p><p>While Qin Sang was shocked, these thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>The beam of light was extremely fast, and Qin Sang didn't have time to dodge at all. He hurriedly activated his spiritual power and poured it into the gray robe magic weapon. The gray fog on his body grew rapidly, gathering at an astonishing speed.</p><p>In the next moment, Qin Sang was about to be swallowed by the beam of light.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The gray robe magic weapon couldn't hold on for even a breath and shattered into pieces the moment it came into contact with the beam of light.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The thunder fell.</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely horrified. Even if he activated the Nine Dragon Heavenly Carriage Talisman now, it would be impossible to escape the range of the beam of light.</p><p>In this critical moment, Qin Sang made a decisive decision. He hurriedly swiped his hand on the Corpse Puppet Bag, and the few remaining zombies and the Corpse Puppet refined from Luo Xingnan's body flew out at the same time. They fearlessly迎着The beam of light and flew upwards.</p><p>Corpses used their bodies to withstand the thunder!</p><p>The strength of the few zombies was only equivalent to that of Qi Refining cultivators. They instantly followed in the footsteps of the gray robe magic weapon and turned into dust as soon as they made contact.</p><p>The Corpse Puppet lasted a little longer. It let out a terrifying roar, and its煞气 rolled out without any reservation, counterattacking the thunder.</p><p>But it was no match for the thunder either. Its煞气 was quickly depleted, cracks appeared on its body, and then it exploded with a ‘bang’.</p><p>‘Pu!’</p><p>Qin Sang's throat turned sweet, as if he had been hit by a heavy hammer. A mouthful of blood spurted out and was immediately extinguished by the thunder. His figure was swept by the thunder and flew out like a kite with a broken string.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Dust and gravel flew everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang banged hard against the hard rock, letting out a cry of pain. The Corpse Fiend bore the brunt of the Spirit Sigil’s power, but the remaining lightning was still very terrifying.</p><p>Qin Sang’s clothes were torn, and there were countless wounds on his body. He looked miserable. Before he could inspect his injuries, clear sword cries rang out from the two mountains on either side of him. Sword beams flashed, and like swimming dragons, they arrived in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The killing moves came one after another, giving Qin Sang no chance to catch his breath.</p><p>At the same time,</p><p>Several streaks of escaping light flew out from the mountains, closely following the sword beams.</p><p>There was one streak of light from the mountain on the left, and two on the right!</p><p>Three people!</p><p>They had been hiding in the distance, launching a sneak attack with Spirit Sigils, and once Qin Sang was hit, they closed in immediately.</p><p>From one of the two streaks of escaping light on the right came a shout that was very familiar to Qin Sang.</p><p>“Quick! Don’t give him a chance to use a Dharma treasure!”</p><p>Yu Daiyue!</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart shook.</p><p>Hearing this voice, he suddenly understood that the other party’s ambush was meant for him!</p><p>Because Yu Daiyue was there, he knew that Qin Sang would go to the Mystic Heavenly Crystal Realm and would take this path.</p><p>But what Qin Sang didn’t understand was that Yu Daiyue had launched a sneak attack on him, and was hating him to the point of wanting him dead?</p><p>This was definitely not Lesser Mount Hua’s decision because, besides Yu Daiyue, the other two people weren’t disciples of Lesser Mount Hua, and Qin Sang didn’t recognize either of them.</p><p>He and Yu Daiyue had no grievances, and they were fellow disciples, and they had even worked together twice in the Corpse Sect’s cave and the ancient cultivator’s ruins. Even if they didn’t have a deep friendship, they had some acquaintance with each other.</p><p>Or had Qin Sang offended Yu Daiyue without even knowing it, leading to him taking this action?</p><p>Even though Qin Sang had never had any expectations of anyone outside himself, a surge of anger still rose in his heart, but Qin Sang quickly suppressed this anger.</p><p>With a life-threatening crisis at hand, he couldn’t let rage affect his emotions.</p><p>If there were any grudges, he would settle them slowly after he escaped from this crisis!</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze passed through the crisscrossing sword beams, and his blood-red eyes stared coldly at Yu Daiyue. Then, his glabella suddenly flashed, and the Ebony Sword flew out quickly, narrowly blocking the two sword beams.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Ebony Sword was knocked flying, but those two flying swords were also damaged.</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure flickered suddenly, passing between the two flying swords at lightning speed.</p><p>Then, there was a bang behind him. Someone else’s flying sword stabbed into the spot he had just occupied, leaving a bottomless sword mark.</p>
