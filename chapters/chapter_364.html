<h1>Chapter 357: No Affinity</h1><p>“You’ve done well!”</p><p>Qin Sang felt little connection to the Qin family. However, having taken over Qin Sanwa’s body and inherited his karmic ties, he felt obliged to ensure the well-being of Qin Sanwa’s closest relatives.  He had asked Wu Chuanzong to look after them.  Wu Chuanzong, taking Qin Sang’s words as a sacred decree, had elevated the Qin family from farmers to a prominent clan, exceeding all expectations.</p><p>Qin Sang initially intended to briefly visit his old friend and then depart.  Seeing Wu Chuanzong’s evident reluctance and Wu Furen's hesitant expression, he recalled his own arduous journey in search of immortality.  In a solemn tone, he said, “As you just heard, cultivating immortality is not as idyllic as one might imagine. I am preoccupied with my own cultivation and unable to take on disciples.  I can only send them to a relatively safe place for them to cultivate on their own. If any of your Wu family descendants aspire to the path of immortality, bring them to me, and I will assess their aptitude.  Of course, the ultimate decision of whether to pursue immortality rests with them.”</p><p>He lacked the energy and the ability to protect them. Even if any of these descendants possessed spiritual roots, he could at most guide them to Han Manor. Their future achievements would depend entirely on themselves.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang added, “Also bring any descendants of the Qin and Bai families who reside in the capital.”</p><p>While Wu Chuanzong gathered the descendants, Qin Sang crafted several jade pendants from a piece of white jade.</p><p>At the fourth watch.</p><p>A commotion erupted within the Grand Tutor’s residence.  More than a dozen young men and women were roused abruptly from their sleep.  Initially annoyed, their excitement surged upon realizing they had been brought to the Grand Tutor’s residence.  They gathered, chattering amongst themselves.</p><p>“To be summoned by the Grand Tutor in the dead of night… no wonder our parents were so urgent…”</p><p>“What important matter could require a meeting at this hour? Could it be that Grandfather recognizes our talents and intends to entrust us with responsibilities?”</p><p>“Why are only members of our three families present?”</p><p>“Brother Qin, with your literary and martial prowess, you must have gained the Grand Tutor’s favor. Congratulations are in order…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Sir, everyone has arrived.”</p><p>Wu Chuanzong stood before the door and reported softly. Hearing no response, his expression changed, and he hurriedly pushed the door open.</p><p>The room was lit by flickering candlelight, but the figure was gone.  On the desk lay a jade bottle and three white jade pendants.</p><p>Qin Sang’s voice suddenly echoed in his ears.</p><p>“Chuanzong, these descendants lack spiritual roots and have no affinity for the immortal path. This may not be a bad thing.</p><p>“Give this bottle of pills to Shuihouzi for me. I won’t visit him myself.</p><p>“These jade pendants are imbued with a protective ward.  Each of your three families shall receive one.  In the event of a catastrophic threat to your families, a drop of blood upon the pendant will activate the ward and save your family from peril.</p><p>“Remember, each pendant can only be used once and will be destroyed afterward. Only the blood of your three families can activate the ward. Do not misuse this power for nefarious purposes.  Consider it my final parting gift.</p><p>“Chuanzong, after this farewell, I fear we may never meet again. Take good care of yourself…”</p><p>The voice faded, growing distant.</p><p>“Sir!”</p><p>Wu Chuanzong prostrated himself, weeping bitterly.  Suddenly recalling something, he looked up and cried out towards the empty space, “Sir! Before the late Emperor passed away, she left a decree that her coffin should not be placed in the Imperial Mausoleum, but buried on Sacred Mountain!  The late Emperor was diligent in her governance and lived a frugal life, never marrying or having children. She once said that the person she could love must be an exceptional individual, just like her, possessing unwavering resolve…”</p><p>After a long silence, a soft sigh echoed from the void. “I understand…”</p><p>A look of solace spread across Wu Chuanzong’s face as he slumped to the ground.</p><p>…</p><p>Sacred Mountain.</p><p>This royal mountain was rumored to be the abode of immortals.  Its summit was forbidden territory, and no one dared to trespass.</p><p>On the rear slope of Sacred Mountain, a nameless stele stood solitary.</p><p>The mountain soared thousands of feet, seemingly able to touch the sun and moon. From this vantage point, one could overlook the capital and gaze up at the heavens, as if meeting the gaze of immortals.</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared on the path leading to the nameless stele, having somehow bypassed the countless guards.  With a wine flask in one hand and a wine cup in the other, he walked steadily towards the stele.</p><p>He stood motionless before the stele for a long while.</p><p>The newcomer was Qin Sang.</p><p>Recalling that night before his departure, when he had audaciously used Sacred Mountain as a metaphor to express his aspiration for immortality, Qin Sang murmured, “You still remember…  Fortunately, I have never forgotten either.  Otherwise, how could I have the face to return and see you?”</p><p>He opened the flask, and the aroma of the celestial brew, Azure Rainbow Wine, filled the air, living up to its reputation.</p><p>Qin Sang poured a cup and placed it before the stele. He whispered, “A toast to you! Congratulations on realizing your dream, ascending to the throne as a woman, and leaving behind the legend of an emperor for the ages… The path of immortality is more arduous than I imagined, but I won't give up. I hope you, in the afterlife, will also bless me…”</p><p>Qin Sang took a long swig from the flask, realizing that even with his spiritual power sealed within his Dantian, his Foundation Establishment stage body could easily withstand the effects of the alcohol.</p><p>He turned and started walking back.</p><p>His steps were heavy at first, then quickened into a brisk stride.</p><p>Accompanied by the gentle breeze and the bright moon.</p><p>…</p><p>Emerald Mountain.</p><p>Daylight had broken, and many believers had already ascended the mountain to burn incense and offer prayers.</p><p>The bun shop in Three Witches City was still there, now run by the previous owner's grandson. He naturally didn’t recognize Qin Sang. The meat buns remained as delicious as ever.  After heartily enjoying his meal, Qin Sang arrived at Emerald Mountain and revealed himself in a secluded spot.</p><p>Ascending the familiar mountain path, he was surprised to find Green Ram Temple newly renovated.</p><p>The stone lintel engraved with ‘Green Ram Temple’ was still there, but the characters had been freshly painted, and the crooked wooden doors had been replaced.</p><p>Curiosity piqued, Qin Sang entered the temple. A quick glance revealed that the layout hadn’t changed much, but the halls and walls had been rebuilt with green bricks, indicating that the temple was now far more prosperous.</p><p>Just then, a farmer, supporting an elderly woman, emerged from the Green Ram Hall, repeatedly thanking the Daoist priest.</p><p>The scene felt familiar.</p><p>However, their clothing, though not luxurious, was clean.  They appeared comfortable, unlike the destitute refugees of the past, with no need to beg for credit.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang had observed that the current Da Sui Dynasty was vastly different from decades ago. The Empress had governed well, and the empire was flourishing.</p><p>Qin Sang wore a simple robe, a magical artifact with restrained aura, but its quality was evident. Coupled with his serene demeanor, he clearly stood out as someone extraordinary.</p><p>The mother and son, fearing they might offend Qin Sang, cautiously made their way out. Before leaving Green Ram Temple, they glanced back at Qin Sang with a hint of worry.</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing their apprehension, understood their concern. They were afraid he might pose a threat to the temple.</p><p>It seemed the Daoist priest here had earned the people’s trust.</p><p>Eagerly, Qin Sang approached the Green Ram Hall and pushed open the doors, only to be met with disappointment.</p><p>As before, the hall was filled with patients waiting quietly for treatment.</p><p>However, presiding over them was a young Daoist priest, around twenty years of age. The old Daoist priest was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Mingyue was gone.</p>
