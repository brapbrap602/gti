<h1>Chapter 988: Sacrifice and Choice</h1><p>Chapter 988: Sacrifice and Choice</p><p>For most people, tonight was no different from any other night.</p><p>But in an unknown place, someone was desperately fighting for survival.</p><p>“Friend, have you had any luck?”</p><p>Qin Sang watched Bai repeatedly condensing the demonic fire incantation seals, each seal taking on a different form.</p><p>He had failed countless times.</p><p>Finally, the seals no longer formed shapes; instead, crisscrossing lines of fire formed a large net.</p><p>The net fell onto Qin Sang, merging with the skin of his arm.</p><p>After a while, the fire curse flared up again, emitting strange fluctuations.  However, the fluctuations from his arm were noticeably weaker, and the fire curse runes were dimmer than elsewhere.</p><p>Seeing this, both Bai and Qin Sang were overjoyed.</p><p>“It worked! Although it only blocks part of the curse's fluctuations, according to your plan, it might mislead him. Unless he notices something and fully activates the curse, it should deceive him for a while.”</p><p>Bai put away the fire net, his excitement tinged with exhaustion.</p><p>He had exhausted himself, racking his brains to find a way to suppress the curse's fluctuations.</p><p>Seeing hope, Qin Sang cheered loudly, then immediately awakened his external incarnation.</p><p>‘Click!’</p><p>The Corpse Coffin opened.</p><p>The external incarnation hovered before Qin Sang.</p><p>“Please, friend, force out a fire curse and transfer it into the incarnation.”</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's plan.</p><p>To hide the fluctuations from his body, to deceive, to lure Old Demon Mu in another direction, to buy time, and while doing so, he would return to find Yuan Zhu.</p><p>There were still several煞尸 (fierce corpses) in the corpse bag, but these corpses lacked intelligence and were too slow, and would quickly be caught by Old Demon Mu.</p><p>Once the plan was discovered, there would be no second chance.</p><p>The demonic fire net could only weaken the curse's fluctuations; Old Demon Mu could still find him if he fully activated the curse.</p><p>His external incarnation, cultivated over decades using his own blood essence, was comparable to a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator.  Although there was a risk of backlash, it was something other Foundation Establishment cultivators only dreamed of possessing.</p><p>Now, it was to be abandoned, used as bait.</p><p>Abandoning his external incarnation was painful.</p><p>But in this critical moment, he had to make a choice.</p><p>A flicker of reluctance crossed Qin Sang's eyes, then he showed determination, reaching for the incarnation's energy sea.</p><p>The incarnation seemed to sense something, its eyes turning crimson instantly, glaring angrily at Qin Sang, its aura suddenly becoming extremely violent and bloodthirsty, attempting to devour its master.</p><p>At that moment, two figures appeared on either side of the incarnation.</p><p>Qin Sang activated a secret technique, and Bai and the two-headed…  acted simultaneously to suppress the incarnation's resistance.</p><p>The incarnation struggled, roaring to the heavens in resentment.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved, pouring his true energy into the incarnation's energy sea, targeting the golden core.</p><p>The incarnation's golden core, a corpse core, had once rendered great service to Qin Sang; now, it too would be sacrificed.</p><p>True energy struck the corpse core.</p><p>The incarnation's dantian violently trembled, the golden core was damaged, true energy dissipated, and its cultivation was actually reduced to the peak of mid-Foundation Establishment.  Because it was Qin Sang's external incarnation, and the corpse core had once belonged to Qin Sang, this was easily done.</p><p>As the incarnation's cultivation fell, its resistance weakened.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was cold, and then he activated the secret technique, finally completely purging the demonic thoughts.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang erased the incarnation's important memories, sending it directly north, flying at full speed; upon being pursued by Old Demon Mu, it was to self-destruct.</p><p>The incarnation's primordial spirit was forged from Qin Sang's sword soul.</p><p>According to Senior Green Bamboo, a sword soul born from cultivation techniques played an important role for cultivators.  If it fell into Old Demon Mu's hands and was controlled by him, it would cause endless trouble.</p><p>“That's a peak Foundation Establishment incarnation! If you two could both form Nascent Souls, it would be like doubling your strength instantly. You could even fight and win against veteran Nascent Soul cultivators…”</p><p>Bai felt sorry for Qin Sang.</p><p>“Once my cultivation and physical body both break through, I won't need the incarnation. I can dominate among cultivators of the same level, and facing a Nascent Soul ancestor, having it or not makes little difference. Moreover, the incarnation's cultivation, having been forcibly raised through blood refinement techniques and the absorption of others' blood essence, has hidden dangers and almost no chance of forming a Nascent Soul; it will become increasingly useless in the future…”</p><p>Qin Sang had come to terms with it.</p><p>If he really needed an external incarnation, he could simply refine another one, it would only take a few more decades.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang placed various restrictions on the incarnation to prevent accidents.</p><p>Bai didn't hesitate and immediately started to act.</p><p>The demonic fire incantation seal reappeared, but it was more solid than before.</p><p>Bai forced out a fire curse and transferred it into the incarnation. Then, he condensed a huge demonic fire net, covering Qin Sang to conceal the fluctuations of the curse.</p><p>The fire curse flared again.</p><p>Qin Sang emitted a faint blue light.</p><p>The curse, sealed within his external manifestation, also erupted, but erratically.  The manifestation, following Bai's instructions, had to actively intervene to stabilize it, preventing its collapse.</p><p>“Success or failure hinges on this!”</p><p>Bai looked at Qin Sang, his voice low.</p><p>On the vast ocean.</p><p>Qin Sang and his manifestation stood facing each other.</p><p>Understanding its purpose, the manifestation bowed to Qin Sang, carrying the curse, and resolutely flew north.</p><p>Temporarily unaffected by demonic influence, the manifestation would obey its master completely.</p><p>The night was cold and windy.</p><p>Waves crashed against the vessel.</p><p>As the manifestation disappeared into the darkness, Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, whispering, “We should go.”</p><p>He activated his escape technique, heading east to find Yuan Zhu.</p><p>They needed to maintain the demonic fire net together with Bai.</p><p>Watching the manifestation's retreating form, Bai marveled at Qin Sang's decisiveness.  “Your manifestation should buy us considerable time… I can attempt to completely seal the curse's fluctuations.”</p><p>“What are your chances of success?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes lit up.  If the curse's fluctuations could be sealed, he wouldn't have to flee like a hunted animal to the storm zone for a sliver of hope.</p><p>He could escape Mou Lao Mo.</p><p>Find a secluded place in another sea region, and calmly resolve the curse.</p><p>Bai shook his head.  “It's hard to say. My understanding of the curse is superficial; its concealment relies heavily on the demonic fire. However, I have some leads now, so I can try.  You should focus on maintaining your escape technique and distance yourself from Mou Lao Mo.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the waters behind them.</p><p>Mou Lao Mo's speed remained undiminished; his expression was relaxed.</p><p>Reactivating the curse, Mou Lao Mo chuckled, “Finally giving up, are you?”</p><p>He sensed his prey slowing down significantly.</p><p>In fact, the prey's initial speed had surprised him. It seemed some unsustainable technique had been used.</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>After a day and a night of escape.</p><p>Thankfully, Qin Sang felt the distance between himself and Mou Lao Mo increasing – the manifestation had successfully drawn him away!</p><p>However, the crisis wasn't over.</p><p>Once Mou Lao Mo caught up with the manifestation, everything would return to square one.</p>
