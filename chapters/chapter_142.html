<h1>**Chapter 135: Mysterious Turtle Shell Formation**</h1><p>After stepping into the realm of immortal cultivation and recognizing his own talent, Qin Sang never dared to mention immortality lightly.</p><p>Nascent Soul.</p><p>He had only thought about it in his dreams.</p><p>Even during the Qi Refining stage, he did not dare to hope for Golden Core.</p><p>As the saying goes, ambition grows with success. After establishing his Foundation, Qin Sang's ambitions began to grow.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder, if he could reach the Foundation Establishment stage, what if he inadvertently reached the Golden Core stage? After forming a Golden Core, could he use it to prolong his life?</p><p>It was said that there were spirit medicines in the realm of immortal cultivation that could increase lifespan.</p><p>Such a priceless treasure only appeared once in a lifetime, and it was impossible to obtain a second one. Now that he had it in his hands, it would be a great pity to let it slip away, and it would be a sin punishable by the heavens.</p><p>If he could fortuitously form a Golden Core, the Transcending Tribulation Pill would increase his chances of forming an Infant Soul by 20%. He could directly surpass the so-called geniuses, and its significance could not be overstated.</p><p>After learning the true effects of the Nine-Illusory Heavenly Orchid, Qin Sang made a secret decision that he would only consider other matters if he had no other choice.</p><p>Qin Sang was now certain that Elder Yi of the Shadow Sect was plotting against the Myriad Light Sect for the sake of this Nine-Illusory Heavenly Orchid.</p><p>Elder Yi's lifespan was coming to an end. If he did not take a desperate gamble and advance to the Nascent Soul stage, he would only face an end of old age and death.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang could not help but slander him in his heart. If Elder Yi really obtained this Nine-Illusory Heavenly Orchid and discovered that it had only undergone seven transformations, requiring at least another five hundred years before it could be used, would he die on the spot?</p><p>Unless he had a way to ripen the spirit medicine.</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of the Treasure Tower Peak, flipped his palm, and several jade slips appeared in his palm. These jade slips were all relics of that grandmaster alchemist, and one of them was the jade slip that mentioned the Nine-Illusory Heavenly Orchid. It contained not only records about the Nine-Illusory Heavenly Orchid, but also the recipe for the Transcending Tribulation Pill. In order to conceal his true purpose, Qin Sang borrowed the pretense of comprehending the Dao of Alchemy and bought them all.</p><p>He wondered if Senior Brother Zhang, seeing the respect he had for Daoist Ma, gave him a discount, charging him only a mid-grade spirit stone.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had previously seen in the alchemy room many pill recipes with extraordinary effects, but they were all casually thrown in a corner, looking like they had not been touched in a long time.</p><p>Without spirit medicine, no matter how good the pill recipe was, it was worthless.</p><p>Qin Sang picked out that jade slip and carefully put it in his Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>Forming an Infant Soul was like a distant dream, he could only plant the seed of a dream first.</p><p>What he had to do now was to cultivate diligently and find a way to form a Golden Core. Only after forming a Golden Core could he think about the Transcending Tribulation Pill.</p><p>Standing on the ground for a while, Qin Sang set off towards the Grandmaster's Hall.</p><p>After waiting in the Grandmaster's Hall for a while, Grandmaster Yu finally returned to the sect. Qin Sang put down the teacup in his hand and stood up to bow.</p><p>"Greetings, Grandmaster."</p><p>"I have kept Junior Brother Qin waiting for a long time."</p><p>Grandmaster Yu smiled and returned the greeting, looking at Qin Sang. "Junior Brother Qin has a good complexion, congratulations."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled bitterly and said, "Thanks to Grandmaster's gift of the Nine Yang Pills and my timely consumption of them, I was able to recover my vitality. I have yet to thank Grandmaster."</p><p>Grandmaster Yu chuckled and said, "Those are all part of my duties, Junior Brother Qin does not need to be so polite. Moreover, the Nine Revolving Pills are the compensation set by Daoist Ma. That's right..."</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Grandmaster Yu slapped his hand, "I almost forgot. I had promised before that once Junior Brother Qin completed the mission, he could make a request. I wonder if you have thought about what you want?"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang did not hesitate for long before saying, "Reporting to Grandmaster, I have no other requests, I only want a grand formation that can protect my cave府 and defend against foreign enemies. It is best if it can also conceal it, allowing me to cultivate in peace. It is just that this disciple is shallow and knows nothing about formations, so I would trouble Grandmaster to make the selection for me."</p><p>When Grandmaster Yu had promised this before, he had not set any limits. It seemed that any request could be fulfilled.</p><p>But Qin Sang was not so naive. The Nascent Soul Patriarch had bestowed upon him the Ten Thousand Dragons Ginseng to help him establish his Foundation, which was enough to offset most of the debt. If he were to ask for too much, it would be presumptuous.</p><p>As he sat and sipped his tea earlier, Qin Sang had already made up his mind.</p><p>The Nine-Illusory Heavenly Orchid was extremely demanding in its growth environment. The grandmaster alchemist had stated in the jade slip that the minimum requirement was a spirit spring, with a spiritual eye being the best.</p><p>The spirit spring in his cave府 was not yet fully formed, but it was much stronger than other spirit springs. It was perfect to plant the Nine-Illusory Heavenly Orchid there. When he found a real spirit spring in the future, he could transplant it then.</p><p>That cave府 was in the Endless Ocean of Clouds and had no protection. He could not do without a spirit formation to guard it.</p><p>Although this cave house’s original magic circle is effective, it was set up by the bamboo daemon, and it was only really intended to protect the cave house.  Qin Sang cannot rest assured about planting the Illusionary Orchid in here.</p><p>Sect Master Yu, not knowing his intentions, misunderstood and said in surprise, “Martial Brother Qin, have you decided to seek a cave house outside of the sect? You can go to the Spirit Beast Hall on Treasure Pagoda Peak. Several spirit beasts there are capable of finding Spirit Veins and sensing spiritual eyes. You are welcome to borrow them.”</p><p>Once Shaohua Mountain disciples break through the Foundation Establishment stage, they can claim their own cave house. They may choose one available in the sect on a first come first serve basis. However, some people don’t like being held back by the sect. They may choose to enter the Yun Cang Great Swamp and seek a suitable location with the help of the sect’s spirit beasts. They may then establish their own cave house.</p><p>The Spirit Veins of Shaohua Mountain are matchless within several thousand miles. Even if it’s only a spiritual eye of ordinary quality in a cave house, the spiritual energy is much purer than elsewhere.</p><p>Finding a cave house outside better than this is very difficult. Not to mention safety could likely not be guaranteed.</p><p>Qin Sang wanting a protective magic circle for his cave house seems very reasonable.</p><p>Sect Master Yu contemplated the matter and secretly nodded. He was actually worried that Qin Sang would be too young and impetuous, thus making unreasonable demands. It seems now that he is someone who knows how to make concessions. This will make things much easier.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Sect Master Yu’s eyes lit up and he exclaimed, “Martial Brother Qin arrived at just the right time. The sect has just come into the possession of a set of formation flags called the Profound Darkness Turtle Shell Circle. It is perfect for guarding a cave house. Martial Brother Qin, please wait a moment…”</p><p>Sect Master Yu left in a hurry, and Qin Sang waited for a while. Then, he saw him return with several jet-black small flags in his hand. He handed them to Qin Sang.</p><p>There were seven total, with faint ripples of water on their surfaces. To those who can see it, the ripples were moving. A mysterious turtle rises and submerges within the ripples, appearing and disappearing from time to time.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a cool breeze as he took the flag pole. The cool breeze, he discovered, came from wisps of Profound Darkness qi wrapped around the flags.</p><p>“Martial Brother Qin, this set of Profound Darkness Turtle Shell Circle formation flags is quite the find. They are the remains left by a high-level cultivator of the Yuan Shen Sect who was an expert in magic circles. When the flags are planted, they will produce Profound Darkness qi, with a concealing effect that makes them difficult for the naked eye to see. Even if a Nascent Soul cultivator sweeps the area with Divine Consciousness, they will likely not be found. Should any enemies invade, the formation will change. The turtle will appear, and its defensive strength is also very strong. If Martial Brother deems this acceptable, I’ll go ahead and give you this set of formation flags,”</p>
