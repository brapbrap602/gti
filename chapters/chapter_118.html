<h1>Chapter 111: Foundation Establishment Pill</h1><p>Sun De's eyes flickered. "Junior Brother Qin, since you're not afraid of the Heart-Devouring Worm consuming your spirit, why the rush? I've honestly answered all your questions, demonstrating my sincerity. Now it's your turn to show yours. Find me a suitable body to possess, and once I'm safe, I'll tell you how to remove the Heart-Devouring Worm…"</p><p>Qin Sang watched Sun De impassively. Spiritual power suddenly surged in his palm.  His hand clenched abruptly. Sun De, caught off guard by Qin Sang's decisiveness, cried out, "Only Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Kuiyin Sect know how to remove the Heart-Devouring Worm! Spare me, and I'll beg my father to help you… Ah…"</p><p>Sun De's scream was cut short as his nascent spirit was crushed into motes of light by Qin Sang.</p><p>"You must have been puzzled about how I could resist the Heart-Devouring Worm, yet you endured and never asked. Not bad.  You wanted to refine me into the main soul of the Yama Banner, knowing so many of my secrets.  With such deep machinations, how could I let you leave? As for the Heart-Devouring Worm, I just won't leave Mount Shaohua before I reach Foundation Establishment. There's only one Golden Core old monster left in the Kuiyin Sect.  I can't be that unlucky to run into him, can I?"  Qin Sang muttered, dusting off his hands.</p><p>Leaving Sun De alive long enough for his nascent spirit to escape was deliberate. Qin Sang had never intended to spare him.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted.  The chill in his heart hadn't dissipated. He had truly tasted the ruthlessness of the cultivation world. Without the Jade Buddha's help, he didn't know how many times he would have died.</p><p>His eyes fell upon Sun De's storage pouch, which had been flung aside.  With a wave of his hand, he retrieved it.</p><p>He emptied the pouch with his divine sense, its contents spilling across the cave floor.</p><p>Tossing aside mundane items and low-grade magical artifacts, Qin Sang's gaze landed on seven black ghost banners.</p><p>One large banner and six smaller ones. The six smaller banners were the same size as his Yama Banner, but the ghosts depicted on them were fiercer and more distinct. Qin Sang suspected these were the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>Sun De actually possessed six Ten Yama Banners, enough to form an array. No wonder he kept dodging and weaving in their fight, trying to use his artifacts. Fortunately, Qin Sang hadn't given him the chance.</p><p>The Ten Yama Array left by Patriarch Kuiyin couldn't be simple. If Sun De had managed to deploy it, the Ebony Sword might not have prevailed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of relief. Picking up the Ten Yama Banners, he discovered they were slightly inferior to typical high-grade artifacts, far from top-grade. It seemed Sun De was indeed constrained on Mount Shaohua,不敢乱来 unable to act recklessly.</p><p>He put the banners away, needing to refine them before use. He then picked up the largest banner and his expression changed.</p><p>This banner was identical to the one Zhao Yan used at the Yuanzhao Sect. It was a true magical treasure!</p><p>"Could this be the genuine Ten Yama Banner left by Patriarch Kuiyin?" Qin Sang wondered aloud. Sun De had mentioned that Patriarch Kuiyin left five Ten Yama Banners to his disciples, and his father was a descendant of one of them.</p><p>Recalling how Zhao Yan had wielded this treasure, Qin Sang's heart raced.  The Ebony Sword was merely a fragment of a treasure and already so powerful. If he could control a complete treasure, who among his peers could stand against him?</p><p>But his excitement was quickly doused. He remembered that Zhao Yan had likely used the power of the sect leader's phantom image within the Four Cloud Divine Prohibition to wield the treasure.  Otherwise, with his Qi Refining stage cultivation, it would have been impossible.</p><p>He had discarded the Four Cloud Divine Prohibition.  Now he could only stare.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, carefully storing the treasure. He continued searching, discovering Sun De's wealth was truly substantial. Having a Foundation Establishment cultivator for a father had its perks.</p><p>There were five medium-grade spirit stones and over a hundred low-grade ones.</p><p>Numerous common talismans that Sun De hadn't had the chance to use now belonged to Qin Sang.</p><p>Bottles of spirit herbs dazzled Qin Sang. He was no longer a novice in the cultivation world and could recognize most of them.  Many were healing herbs, superior to those he had obtained from the man in the bamboo hat.</p><p>There were even herbs that restored spiritual power during combat.</p><p>Qin Sang sorted and stored them, setting aside the unfamiliar ones to be identified at Pagoda Peak.  As he reached for a jade bottle, he gasped, his face lighting up with excitement.  He grabbed the bottle, holding it up for closer inspection.</p><p>Inside the jade vial were two shimmering blue spirit pills, each the size of a fava bean. Qin Sang gently opened the vial and immediately caught a pungent aroma, exactly as described in the texts he'd read.</p><p>Foundation Establishment Pills!</p><p>And two of them!</p><p>Sun De, not yet forty, was already at the eleventh level of Qi Refining. One pill was likely a reward from Shaohua Mountain, and the other probably an heirloom from his father.</p><p>Sun De was probably thinking the same thing as him: reach a higher level of Qi Refining before attempting the breakthrough, thereby increasing the odds of success.</p><p>Qin Sang clutched the vial, his heart pounding. He hadn't been this excited even after acquiring the magical treasure.</p><p>Treasures were merely external. Foundation Establishment Pills were the true key to his transformation!</p><p>Foundation Establishment, what an exhilarating and captivating term! Success meant he would no longer be a helpless pawn, and his sect would surely value him more.</p><p>More importantly, it represented a giant leap forward on his immortal path!</p><p>Qin Sang’s greatest fear had been his mediocre aptitude.  He'd worried that a single pill wouldn't be enough.  He'd even resigned himself to spending over a decade searching for more, knowing that while the chances of success diminished after forty,  the declining vitality before fifty wasn't entirely decisive.</p><p>Now, with three Foundation Establishment Pills beckoning, how could he not be ecstatic?</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the pills, enthralled. Suddenly, he remembered something and quickly sealed the vial, lest their spiritual energy dissipate and diminish their potency. That would be a devastating loss.</p><p>A self-deprecating smile touched his lips as he realized he was getting carried away, but he couldn't suppress the upturn of his mouth. He wanted to laugh out loud.</p><p>Once his excitement subsided, Qin Sang considered how to conclude this affair.</p><p>Sun De was a formal disciple of Shaohua Mountain. He couldn't simply be killed like a rogue cultivator.  However, since Sun De came for the Ten Kings Yama Banner in secret, his presence was unknown. The Earth Sinkhole was the perfect place to erase all traces, and it shouldn’t be difficult to avoid suspicion.</p><p>With that decided, Qin Sang sprang into action. He gathered everything except valuables, including Sun De's body, and flew towards the depths of the Earth Sinkhole.</p><p>Only when he watched everything burn to ashes, scattering into the abyss, was Qin Sang finally at ease.</p>
