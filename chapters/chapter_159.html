<h1>**Chapter 152 - Fire Crow Token**</h1><p>Upon hearing this, the group looked at the Liu brothers in astonishment.</p><p>The 13th layer of Qi Refining seemed to be only a step away from Foundation Establishment, but the gap between the two couldn't be measured so simply. This was the first time Qin Sang had heard of two Qi Refining 13th layer cultivators being able to work together to exert strength comparable to a Foundation Establishment cultivator. That cultivation method was very peculiar.</p><p>The Liu brothers looked similar, but their personalities were slightly different. The elder brother, Liu Jiang, was more composed.</p><p>Liu Jiang cupped his hands and said in a composed manner, "We've made you seniors laugh. The two of us are twins, and we've been able to telepathically sense each other since childhood, which is how we were able to cultivate this technique. My younger brother and I can connect spiritually, and our primordial spirits' defenses are stronger than most. When we join forces, we have a few spell incantations that are reasonably powerful, but they are far inferior to you seniors'. Senior is exaggerating."</p><p>The group smiled but didn't inquire further. Believing or not was up to them.</p><p>Qing Ting slightly lowered her body. Looking around the group, she said, "My Junior Brother Yu and I invited you all to explore because we believe in your capabilities. You will be a great help to us. Junior Brother Yu must have already introduced you all to the ancient cultivator's ruins and explained their pros and cons, so I won't repeat myself. I invited you here today to get a definite answer."</p><p>Yu Daiyue also said, "Seven people are needed to use the formation-breaking artifact. If you fellow Daoists all agree, then I won't have to ask anyone else. I'll distribute the formation-breaking artifacts to you now, and as soon as you refine them at will, we can leave."</p><p>Qing Ting and Yu Daiyue looked at Qin Sang and the others in silence.</p><p>After a brief silence, no one spoke. The atmosphere was slightly awkward.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng cleared his throat and said, "Senior Sister Qing Ting, Senior Brother Yu, I've already promised, and I will definitely keep my word. However, I've always had a doubt. The magic sound restriction outside the ancient cultivator's ruins is not to be feared, but what dangers are there inside the great formation? Senior Brother Yu previously said that you have been preparing for several years, refining artifacts to break the formation. Excuse my audacity, Senior Brother, but could you let us take a look?"</p><p>Yu Daiyue looked at Qing Ting. Seeing her nod, he said, "Junior Brother Wu and the other fellow Daoists don't need to worry. Qing Ting and I have tested it many times, and the great formation itself is not dangerous. It's an array mainly comprised of a water element restriction, but it's exceptionally sturdy. With the strength of the two of us alone, we can't shake this formation, so we had to return to the mountain to find a way to break the formation. Senior Sister Qing Ting found a type of artifact called a Fire Crow Token in the Towering Treasure Peak records. Water and fire oppose each other. If each of us holds a Fire Crow Token and arranges them in a formation, we can focus on attacking the great formation's weak points. The probability of breaking the formation is extremely high. That's why we invited you fellow Daoists to lend a hand."</p><p>As he spoke, Yu Daiyue retrieved a token-shaped artifact from his mustard seed pouch and showed it to the group.</p><p>Seeing this strange artifact, Qin Sang's eyes flashed with surprise. The token was less than a palm long. It was pointed at both ends and had a round shape in the middle. It was completely white, or rather, pale white. It was actually composed of countless thin bones that were clasped together.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could see that these bones were actually shaped like bird claws. They were tightly clasped together and squeezed into a ball, finally forming the shape of a token. It was extremely strange.</p><p>In the center of the clasped bird claws, there was a ball of dark green flame. The flame shifted and changed, sometimes transforming into the shape of a fire crow. It was as if a fire crow spirit was sealed inside. The fire crow was bound by the bird claws and constantly struggled, burning it with its flames, but to no avail. It opened its mouth and let out a silent cry.</p><p>The moment Yu Daiyue took out the Fire Crow Token, a pure fire energy rushed toward them. Qin Sang even felt a slight burning sensation on his face. It was clear that this token's power was definitely not weak.</p><p>"Each Fire Crow Token is refined from the corpse bones of a spiritual bird that's skilled at controlling fire. They're not easy to collect. Qing Ting and I traveled to various marketplaces before we finally gathered enough materials for the seven Fire Crow Tokens. After this token was refined, the fire element energy contained within the spiritual bird's corpse bones was refined into a fire crow spirit. Not only is it extremely powerful, but it also has an explosive temper. Only Foundation Establishment cultivators can completely tame this thing and use its spirit to break the formation as they wish... the two Liu brothers should also be able to."</p><p>After introducing it, Yu Daiyue passed the Fire Crow Token to everyone for them to take a look.</p><p>When it was Qin Sang's turn, he reached out and grabbed the Fire Crow Token. The fire crow's sharp cry suddenly rang out in his mind. Qin Sang acted as if he hadn't heard anything. As Yu Daiyue had said, he extended a strand of spiritual energy inside to probe it. It was easily destroyed by the fire crow spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in secret. The fire crow spirit inside the token was indeed fierce. It would be difficult for Qi Refining cultivators to control it and make it obey commands.</p><p>However, after releasing the Fire Phoenix Essence to break the formation, it will consume the Fire Origin energy. It is not known whether it can be replenished if it is consumed. If it cannot, this magic weapon can only be used a few times, or even become unusable after breaking the formation.</p><p>Finally, the Fire Phoenix Order was passed into Bai Yunshan's hand. After Bai Yunshan returned the Fire Phoenix Order to Yu Daiyue, he stroked his long beard and mused, "Listening to the description of the two fellow Daoists, the old Daoist feels that the grand formation is like a certain seal. Could it be that a certain evil thing is sealed inside? May I ask the two fellow Daoists how much you understand about this ancient cultivator's remains?"</p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, everyone looked at each other in dismay. The purpose of exploring the ruins was to seek treasure. If an evil thing was released, it would not be worth the loss.</p><p>Qing Ting's expression did not change as he said, "That grand formation not only blocks the line of sight, but can also block spiritual consciousness. We do not know what exists within the grand formation. However, according to the analysis of my Junior Brother Yu and I, this formation does not seem to be a seal. It looks more like the original protective grand formation of the ancient cultivator's cave dwelling. Even if there is really an evil thing sealed inside, judging from the strength of the grand formation, the strength of the evil thing will not be too high. With so many Foundation Establishment cultivators like us, we do not need to fear it. Otherwise, there must be another level of sealing inside. At that time, we can make a decision depending on the situation."</p><p>Bai Yunshan nodded slightly, but Liu Shan suddenly said, "My eldest brother and I are itinerant cultivators who agreed to come with the two seniors precisely because we wanted to find a treasure that would help us break through our bottleneck. We understand the principle that wealth and honor come with risk and are not afraid of any evil thing. However, our brothers' strength is far inferior to the seniors'. If it is obvious that there is great danger behind the grand formation, and the seniors insist on entering, shouldn't our brothers follow suit and be sent to certain death?"</p><p>Seeing that everyone seemed to agree with Liu Shan, Qing Ting and Yu Daiyue exchanged glances and thought for a moment before saying, "Fellow Daoist Liu's words are quite reasonable. However, my Junior Brother Yu and I also came for the treasure that would help us break through the bottleneck. Moreover, we have already spent a lot of money just to find the ruins and refine the magic weapon. Unless it is a place of extreme danger, we will certainly not give up.</p><p>If all of the fellow Daoists are worried about safety, have different opinions, and are unwilling to enter the ruins, we can send you back. This would be the equivalent of hiring you to assist in breaking the formation. According to the rules of the cultivation world, once the matter is accomplished, we will give you certain rewards. Since the danger of breaking the formation is not great, the rewards will not be too high. However, from the moment we set off, you must listen to the arrangements made by the two of us."</p>
