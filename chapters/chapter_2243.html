<h1>Chapter 2233: Deception</h1><p>*Rumble… rumble…*</p><p>A white waterfall cascaded down the mountain, its mist shrouding the surrounding peaks in a hazy veil.  The waterfall flowed into a river, winding its way through the mountains.  Many birds and animals frolicked and drank by the riverbank, living carefree lives for generations.</p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>The birds and animals on the riverbank all raised their heads, looking westward. A shrill whistle, like a sharp cry, echoed from the horizon. Moments later, the western sky turned dusky, the light fading rapidly.</p><p>The dusk spread across the mountains, revealing a sandstorm. The lush green leaves quickly turned yellow-brown, their vitality destroyed. Sandstorms occurred here every few months; the rain would wash away the sand soon after, so the animals were used to it.  Now, some sought shelter in tree hollows, others jumped into the river to escape the wind and sand.</p><p>*Cheep… cheep…*</p><p>The birds and animals shrieked, their cries filled with fear.  A huge black object emerged from the sandstorm, hovering motionless above the waterfall – a large magic vessel.</p><p>Moments later, figures flew out of the vessel in different directions. One of them paused in mid-air, revealing a man –  Master Tongshen. He checked his bearings and sped off.</p><p>Their mission was to relocate the mortals living in this region, but Master Tongshen had a more important task – helping Qin Sang subdue the Stone-born Fire.</p><p>Flying hundreds of miles, he passed several human settlements. He simply marked their locations, not immediately transporting them.</p><p>Then, a deep chasm appeared ahead, its dark bottom exuding a chilling aura. Master Tongshen landed beside it, sensing a familiar presence.  He smiled slightly, “My disciples, come out.”</p><p>“Master is here!”</p><p>Joyful shouts came from below, followed by four figures – Qin Sang and his three companions. They had set out earlier and were waiting for Master Tongshen.</p><p>“Master, what treasure are we seeking? Shouldn’t you tell us?” Qinghong eagerly asked.</p><p>“Didn’t Qingfeng tell you?” Master Tongshen looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>“What? My junior brother knew?”</p><p>The other three felt tricked, glaring at Qin Sang.</p><p>Master Tongshen, however, smiled approvingly. Secrecy was paramount, and this disciple was not only gifted but also level-headed.</p><p>“We are seeking a treasure for your junior brother, but you will benefit too. I intend to make changes to our sect's legacy. If successful, you won’t be stuck like me, unable to progress for so long!”</p><p>Master Tongshen didn’t elaborate, but his words were intriguing, exciting Qingyan and the others.</p><p>He glanced at the sky, “It's getting late, let's go!”</p><p>The five continued, the terrain becoming increasingly treacherous.  Even in the deep forest, they found more human settlements, but these people lived a more primitive life, like wild people.</p><p>After traveling for some time, Master Tongshen stopped his disciples and gave each of them a concealment talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang examined his talisman; it was exquisitely crafted and undoubtedly valuable. They were still some distance from their destination when Master Tongshen instructed them to activate the talismans.</p><p>“Master, is someone after us?” Qingyan asked gravely.</p><p>“Better safe than sorry!”</p><p>Once everyone was concealed, Master Tongshen ordered them to proceed, not flying, but traveling over mountains and through valleys on foot.</p><p>They moved silently.</p><p>After crossing countless mountain peaks, Master Tongshen’s voice suddenly reached them, “Stop!”</p><p>Qin Sang saw several peaks in the distance. The area was affected by the sandstorm. Under the yellow sky, these peaks stood out, taller and steeper than the surrounding mountains, like giant swords thrust into the earth.  The central peak was the tallest, surrounded by others in a near-perfect circle, a breathtaking natural formation.</p><p>These peaks were where the Stone-born Fire resided.</p><p>Their target was ahead, yet Qin Sang’s expression darkened.  Several dark figures circled the mountain peaks – several golden eagles.</p><p>The worst-case scenario finally happened for Master Tongshen. The Golden Eagle tribe had discovered clues about the Stone Fetal Fire in the cave, beating everyone else to it.</p><p>"Master, it seems to be the Golden Eagles…" Qinghong whispered, his voice filled with worry.</p><p>The enemy clearly outnumbered them.  What they saw were likely only those on guard; who knew how many more lurked in the mountains?</p><p>Master Tongshen hummed, unfazed.  He calmly said, "My disciples, fear not! Spiritual treasures possess inherent protective abilities.  An ancient master’s writings detail how, during the Stone Fetal Fire's gestation, it subtly influenced the surrounding earth's energy, forming a natural array, a marvel of heaven and earth. That master himself spent considerable time deciphering the array before entering. It seems these Golden Eagles haven't found a way to break through…"</p><p>The disciples rejoiced. "Master, can we secretly infiltrate the array and retrieve the Stone Fetal Fire without them noticing?"</p><p>"It's difficult!" Master Tongshen shook his head.  "We must first find a way to draw them away."</p><p>While speaking, Master Tongshen observed the Golden Eagles, assessing their auras to judge their cultivation levels.  Their cultivation was comparable to Qingyan and the others, suggesting the Eagles attempting to break the array were likely at the Transformation Realm.</p><p>Of course, the Golden Eagle tribe had stronger individuals, but firstly, they might not willingly share such a treasure; and secondly, if the Golden Eagle ancestor had intervened, the scale of their operation would be far greater.</p><p>Master Tongshen deduced their true opponents were likely the same Golden Eagles who had vied for the cave with them in the past.  He had chosen to act during the Yongtu Immortal City's relocation of mortals precisely to guard against this.</p><p>The next moment, Master Tongshen released four beams of light.  The light entered their bodies, and Qin Sang immediately visualized an array map.  Not only these mountain peaks, but a vast expanse of surrounding mountains were encompassed within a massive and intricate array, though not beyond Qin Sang’s capabilities.</p><p>"It seems the ancient master wasn't exaggerating. This mountain array is ancient and natural, not man-made…"</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind raced, fixing on a white line on the map – the path into the spiritual array.  The entrance lay at the foot of a mountain, concealed, but escaping the perception of Golden Eagle experts would be nearly impossible.</p><p>"Now, you will hide there.  I will draw the Golden Eagles away, then you can seize the opportunity. Qingyan, you must protect your junior brothers, ensuring our efforts are not wasted!" Master Tongshen indicated their hiding place.</p><p>"Master, you're too dangerous alone!" Qingyan worried.</p><p>"Who says I'm alone?" Master Tongshen produced a golden token.  "I'll have reinforcements! Go quickly!"</p><p>This was a Yongtu Immortal City's Sentinel token. Tokens within the same squad could sense each other, allowing for emergency assistance.</p><p>The disciples finally understood their master's plan, their minds at ease.  They obeyed, cautiously moving towards their hiding spots.</p><p>Once his disciples were in position, Master Tongshen slowly retreated, out of the Golden Eagles' sight, activating the Sentinel token and waiting.</p><p>"Master Tongshen, what troubles you?"</p><p>Soon, he heard a familiar voice approaching.</p><p>"Master Hong!"</p><p>Master Tongshen bowed towards the void, "I've just encountered a group of Golden Eagles; I'm unsure if they are targeting us, but they're up ahead…"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>A figure appeared beside Master Tongshen.  This person had wings, a member of the 異人族 (Yi Renzu – translated here as "Otherkin"), known in this era as descendants of deities; his name was Hong Sheng.</p><p>He looked serious. "Did they spot you, Master Tongshen?"</p><p>"Fortunately, I was cautious and didn't alert them," Master Tongshen replied.</p><p>"The Golden Eagles' territory is closest to our Yongtu Immortal City.  If war breaks out, they will be our primary enemy! The Golden Eagles are increasingly active; we must be vigilant. Let's not act rashly.  We'll wait for the other Masters to arrive before investigating…"</p><p>Hong Sheng was calm and composed; Master Tongshen agreed.  They continued to wait, and several more Sentinels arrived.</p><p>They sent a skilled Otherkin adept at concealment to investigate.</p><p>Shortly, the Otherkin returned. "The Golden Eagles aren't targeting us. There’s a great array there, of unknown origin. They are currently trying to break through it."</p><p>"An array here?  Could there be treasure inside?" Someone's eyes gleamed.</p><p>Master Tongshen observed, pleased with how things were unfolding.</p><p>"A storm is brewing. If there is truly a great treasure, we cannot let it fall into the hands of outsiders!" Hong Sheng declared.</p><p>…</p><p>In a mountain valley, Qingyan and the others hid, watching the mountain peak and the circling Golden Eagles, tense and silent.</p><p>Qin Sang whispered, "Master has made his move!"</p><p>Everyone looked up.  Without warning, beams of light erupted in the sky – the radiance of treasures and the glow of divine abilities.</p><p>A series of screams rang out. Several of the Golden Eagles guarding the perimeter fell, dying instantly, creating a bloody rain.</p><p>"Who's there?!"</p><p>An angry roar echoed from the mountain, followed by several dark figures emerging from the shadows.  Without hesitation, magical artifacts and spells were unleashed, striking the figures.  The figures roared back, fighting fiercely.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two sides were locked in battle.  Qin Sang and the others could no longer distinguish individual figures; all they saw was a chaotic dance of flashing lights and deafening explosions, unable to determine which side was gaining the upper hand.</p><p>Seeing that the Golden Eagles were engaged by Tong Shen Shang Ren and the others, Qing Yan became impatient.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>"Brother, wait," Qin Sang grabbed Qing Yan's sleeve, eyes fixed on the sky above.  "Just a little longer!"</p><p>They couldn't even see the battle clearly, nor did they understand what Qin Sang was waiting for, but Qing Yan and the others, knowing their junior brother's unusual abilities, chose to trust him.</p><p>Ten breaths later, Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  "Let's go!"</p><p>They carefully moved along the ground, approaching the edge of the mountain formation.  Before them lay a dense forest.</p><p>The mountain range’s path was strangely winding. After following the contours for some time, they suddenly found a cave.</p><p>One by one, they entered the cave, disappearing from the sight of those outside and sighing in relief.</p><p>The cave was narrow, only wide enough for one person, and bottomless. It had been created by an ancestor, and following the path would lead them to the Stone-Born Fire.</p><p>Outside, the battle raged on, oblivious to their infiltration.</p><p>Qing Yan led the way, the four of them walking in single file. The cave was incredibly winding; after a considerable amount of time, they still couldn't see the end.  They had already traveled a distance that could have circled the entire formation dozens of times.</p><p>Worried about the battle outside, they needed to obtain the Stone-Born Fire and leave before the conflict concluded.</p><p>The seemingly endless cave filled them with growing anxiety.</p><p>After countless turns, they finally heard the sound of dripping water.</p><p>They exchanged hopeful glances and quickened their pace.  Suddenly, the cave opened up.</p><p>A pool of water blocked their path.</p><p>The pool faced a stone wall with a crack in the middle, resembling a stone door.  The ancestor had broken the wall, creating the entrance. This meant they were in the heart of the formation, and the Stone-Born Fire lay beyond the stone door!</p><p>Reaching the pool, Qing Yan said gravely, "Everyone, stay alert. Be careful of the dangers within the pool…"</p><p>The pool contained a spirit formation.  Even knowing its secrets, extreme caution was necessary. Their master wasn't present; one wrong step could be fatal.</p><p>They examined the pool, noticing numerous stalactite columns rising from the water, their surfaces glistening.  They had to jump across these columns.</p><p>Water constantly dripped from the ceiling, so the columns looked significantly different from when the ancestor had originally seen them. The ancestor had left behind a method of calculation, allowing them to estimate changes in the formation based on the columns' height.</p><p>Qing Yan and the others found this calculation incredibly taxing.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang leaped onto a column, shocking Qing Yan and the others.</p><p>"Junior brother, you…"</p><p>"Brothers and sisters, follow me.  Don't fall more than three columns behind."</p><p>Qin Sang jumped to another column. The water in the pool seemed to boil, generating a thick mist.</p><p>Unable to reprimand Qin Sang for his recklessness, Qing Yan and the others trusted him and followed, gritting their teeth.  After jumping several columns, they were surrounded by mist, but encountered no other dangers.</p><p>"Junior brother, have you studied formations?"</p><p>Shuang Luo stared at Qin Sang's back, eyes wide with surprise.</p><p>"Perhaps Master taught him privately.  Junior brother is so intelligent; he masters anything he tries," Qing Hong said proudly.</p><p>The four leaped between the columns, unaware that elsewhere in the mountain formation, a Golden Eagle youth, transformed into human form, had not been lured away by Tong Shen Shang Ren.</p><p>Despite their side being on the defensive, with comrades constantly falling, the young Golden Eagle remained focused on breaking the formation.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression shifted. He sensed a subtle fluctuation, originating from deep within the formation!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Golden Eagle youth opened his eyes, his gaze sharp.  The greatest challenge had been solved.</p><p>In an instant, his wings unfurled, and with a powerful beat, he transformed into a black whirlwind, piercing through the layers of mist.</p>
