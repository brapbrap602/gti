Chapter 576: Laying the Cards on the Table

It is important to understand that every stage of the Outer Palace is fraught with peril.  Places like the Immortal Graveyard would force even experts like Lord Dongyang and Chenyan to proceed with extreme caution.
Yun Youzi's aura hadn't changed much, clearly indicating he was still at the Pseudo Core Formation stage!
Qin Sang looked intently at Yun Youzi.
Yun Youzi had always been enigmatic, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Qin Sang himself had secrets, so he never pried.
Everyone has secrets and taboos. Prying into them can easily turn friends into enemies.
Yun Youzi had never harmed him and had, in fact, helped him a great deal. Qin Sang would certainly not repay kindness with malice.  He was ruthless, yes, but only towards his enemies.
Now, Qin Sang found Yun Youzi increasingly unreadable.
Passing through the Outer Palace and entering the Inner Palace so quickly was simply impossible for an ordinary Pseudo Core Formation cultivator, and likely even for a Golden Core cultivator!
Could Yun Youzi be concealing his true strength?
Could his cultivation be comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator?
Qin Sang was startled by this thought, then mocked himself for such an absurd notion.
Yun Youzi's background was clear. His mortal life during the Great Sui Dynasty was corroborated by Abbot Jixin.  His cultivation path after joining the Taiyi Pill Sect was even clearer.
From Qi Refining, to Foundation Establishment, and then to Pseudo Core Formation.
Every step was hard-won and widely known.
Qin Sang had been involved in many of these events.
There would be no point in Yun Youzi concealing his strength and maintaining such a facade for so long.
Perhaps he had discovered a shortcut to the Inner Palace.
"I traveled with all haste and only just arrived. Thankfully, I haven't delayed your important matter, Brother," Yun Youzi said, seemingly relieved.  "Let's go directly to the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.  We arrived quickly, perhaps before the other competitors."
With that, Yun Youzi activated his movement technique and flew towards the Ancient Herb Garden.
Qin Sang was about to speak, intending to subtly inquire, but thought better of it.  Whatever Yun Youzi's secret was, as long as he bore no ill will, it was none of his concern.
He suppressed these thoughts and silently followed.
Noticing Qin Sang's lingering gaze on the ruins of the ancient city, Yun Youzi spoke, "Brother Qin, do you also find this palm print's presence here strange?"
Qin Sang nodded, sighing deeply, "Such a terrifying palm print, who could have left it?  Could the legends of giants tearing apart dragons and phoenixes be true?"
This palm print didn't seem to be caused by spiritual power.
Fingerprints and palm lines were clearly visible, more like the mark of a physical palm.
This was the true source of Qin Sang's shock.
What kind of powerful physical body could obliterate an immortal city with a single palm?
Cultivating the physical body to such a realm was simply unbelievable.
Qin Sang suspected that even his full-strength attack couldn't pierce the skin of such a being, it would be like tickling them.
It wasn't that there were no body refinement techniques in the cultivation world, but such techniques often required massive resources, including various precious spiritual herbs and heavenly treasures.
Those unorthodox secret techniques all had significant limitations, and their cultivation was equally difficult.
In the current cultivation world, resources were scarce, and pursuing this path was extremely difficult, far more so than orthodox cultivation.
Even those who attempted body refinement would typically do so after achieving a certain level of cultivation, relying on their established strength to gather the necessary resources.
However, while simultaneous cultivation of both physical and spiritual power might lead to a rapid increase in combat prowess in the short term, in the long run, dividing one's focus would ultimately hinder progress, and the outcome would rarely be favorable.
"Not necessarily giants," Yun Youzi shook his head.  "In the ancient cultivation world, those who cultivated their physical bodies to the extreme possessed the great divine ability of 'World Transformation'.  With this power, a mighty cultivator could transform into the heavens and earth, moving mountains and overturning seas.  Leaving such a palm print wouldn't be surprising."
The great divine ability of World Transformation?
Qin Sang fell silent. The more he saw, the more ignorant and insignificant he felt.
The Purple Firmament Palace had unveiled a new layer of this world for him.
The mysterious barrier at the edge of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the Immortal Graveyard in the Outer Palace, the palm print in the Inner Palace – each one was beyond Qin Sang's comprehension.
Whose sacred traces were these, still undestroyed and awe-inspiring to this day?
A Grand Completion cultivator?
Or perhaps even... an Immortal?
"This palm strike completely destroyed the immortal city. Nascent Soul cultivators have thoroughly searched the ruins, finding some surviving magical treasures, but without exception, they've all lost their power. It's said this wasn't due to the passage of time, but a terrifying force that directly destroyed the treasures' essence, likely originating from the palm print."
Yun Youzi's tone was filled with awe and yearning.
Both fell silent, lost in thought.
After a while, Yun Youzi broke the silence.
"Brother Qin, these matters are far beyond our current reach. What we need to consider now is healing our hidden injuries. Although encountering competitors is unlikely, we must still be prepared.
"My Pristine Pearl, when fully activated, can seal a Core Formation demon cultivator for a period of time, the duration depending on the cultivator's strength...
"I also have some understanding of ancient restrictions. If we encounter enemies, I can try to use them to trap our opponents, buying you time."
Qin Sang looked at Yun Youzi in surprise.  The Pristine Pearl possessed such power, capable of sealing even Core Formation demon cultivators?  Had it transformed into a true magical treasure?
Yun Youzi's tone was full of confidence. He had never boasted before, so his words were likely true.
Since Yun Youzi was helping him obtain the herb, and had主动mentioned it, Qin Sang decided to reveal some of his own cards. "Senior, I possess a Void Thunder Talisman.  If absolutely necessary, I'm willing to exchange it for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit. I also control a Night Wanderer-level refined corpse. Having it clear the path and break restrictions will significantly increase our speed."
After this, he could form his Golden Core.
Cultivating the Corpse Dao wouldn't be a major issue for a Golden Core cultivator, as long as he didn't commit atrocities or slaughter mortals and cultivators.  Even if his sect knew, they would likely turn a blind eye.
There was no need to hide it any longer.
"Void Thunder Talisman!  Night Wanderer!"
Yun Youzi was startled, looking at Qin Sang with astonishment. "I've met many Pseudo Core Formation cultivators, but I've never seen one conceal themselves so deeply. Even a Golden Core cultivator who underestimates you would suffer greatly!  Did you obtain the secret technique to refine a Night Wanderer in the ice cave?"
Qin Sang knew he couldn't hide it from Yun Youzi, so he replied ambiguously, "Something like that.  I'm indebted to Senior for leading the way."
Yun Youzi chuckled.
"I'd long suspected you possessed corpse refinement techniques, with that Night Wanderer being of the same origin.
"Are you wondering why I never questioned you?
"In my view, techniques are neither righteous nor evil, it's the person who wields them.
"Brother, don't fault me for investigating you. I know you're not a truly wicked person.
"Employing thunderous methods to kill those who deserve it, while maintaining one's heart and principles – this is how a cultivator should be!"
