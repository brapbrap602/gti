<h1></h1><p>In the North Sea, the Ghost Mother had once forced her way into the Profound Heaven Palace, the foremost power in the region.  A traitor within the palace used the chaos to steal a sacred artifact, leading Tong Lingyu and others on a frantic chase.  Could the Ghost Mother be pulling off a similar stunt here in the Central Continent? The Sweet Dew Monastery had Buddhist sages residing within; even if Yin Changsheng was powerful, he couldn't possibly surpass a true Nascent Soul cultivator. According to previously acquired information, the Ghost Mother's strength shouldn't be enough to wreak havoc in the Sweet Dew Monastery.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed these thoughts and asked, "Did the Venerable see this person's face?"</p><p>Venerable Xiaoxing didn't speak. He raised his right hand, and the wooden bracelet on his wrist shimmered with a faint yellow light. A round bronze mirror appeared in his palm.  The bracelet was likely a spatial treasure similar to the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the bracelet and then looked at the mirror.</p><p>Xiaoxing pressed his hand onto the mirror. Wisps of light emanated from its surface. When he removed his hand, a fleeting image appeared—a white shadow, more than a human form.</p><p>Qin Sang looked twice, somewhat speechless.</p><p>The crucial facial features were completely obscured, blurred like a ghost, making it impossible to discern the intruder's appearance. Was the Sweet Dew Monastery searching for someone based on this meager information?</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's confusion, Xiaoxing adjusted the mirror, replaying the image. "Fellow Daoist, pay attention to this person's movement technique."</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze.</p><p>Finally, he noticed something unusual.</p><p>Just as the figure vanished, their feet made three rapid steps in the void, seemingly following a certain pattern.  Because it was a recorded image, he couldn't sense the fluctuations in the void. But upon closer observation, one could discern a unique rhythm in those steps, indicating a profound technique.</p><p>"The Abbot suspects this person used the 'Steps of Heaven Technique,' a supreme movement art lost for ages in the Central Continent.  This technique is extremely difficult to master.  It requires the preparation of a unique medicinal solution to soak one's legs during the Foundation Establishment realm, to complement cultivation.  One who cultivates this technique likely has considerable achievements in body refinement, possibly practicing a method like the 'Golden Body Scripture.'  Even before mastering the 'Steps of Heaven Technique,' this person would demonstrate exceptional movement abilities, leaving traces. They would also emit a unique medicinal fragrance…"</p><p>Xiaoxing then demonstrated a few characteristics of the Steps of Heaven Technique.</p><p>Qin Sang felt great admiration for the Abbot of the Sweet Dew Monastery. He had deduced so many clues from a single blurred image.  Hearing this, Qin Sang felt it was unlikely to be the Ghost Mother.</p><p>He intentionally put on a contemplative expression and shook his head after a moment. "This poor Daoist has never encountered such a person before. Does the Venerable have any other information? Perhaps we can investigate their motives."</p><p>Xiaoxing hesitated for a moment. "This person infiltrated the monastery stealthily and was later discovered by one of my junior brothers. But this person's stealth and movement technique were both exceptional, allowing them to escape. This image was recreated from my junior brother's recollection. Also, my junior brother made another observation, but he is only ten percent certain and worries it might be misleading. At the moment of exposure, there seemed to be a fleeting aura of a high-rank spirit insect. This person might be proficient in insect control."</p><p>Spirit insects!</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang's heart tightened.</p><p>When it came to insect control, perhaps no one was more proficient than the Ghost Mother.</p><p>"Could it really be her?  I didn't expect anyone would dare to infiltrate the Sweet Dew Monastery. This style of action does resemble the Ghost Mother. The Steps of Heaven Technique could just be a diversion. It would be difficult for others to impersonate, but not necessarily for the Ghost Mother…"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>However…</p><p>Proficient in movement techniques, also cultivating body refinement, and keeping spirit insects.  The more he heard, the more it sounded like something he himself would do.</p><p>Secretly calculating in his mind, Qin Sang maintained a calm expression. He wanted to ask about the Sweet Dew Monastery's losses, but seeing Xiaoxing's silence, unwilling to reveal more, he suppressed his curiosity and promised, "This poor Daoist will immediately contact Fellow Daoist Qin and ask him to keep an eye out."</p><p>Xiaoxing rose and chanted a Buddhist mantra. "Many thanks for your trouble, fellow Daoists. If we can apprehend the culprit, the monastery will offer a generous reward! This poor monk still needs to consult with other fellow Daoists and cannot stay long. I will visit Daoist Priest again in the future."</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't persuade him to stay and personally escorted Xiaoxing out of the mountain gate, agreeing on a method of contact. Xiaoxing invited Qin Sang to visit the monastery, and Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>If there was even a sliver of a chance this person was the Ghost Mother, he had to get involved and find an opportunity to act. Even if it wasn't the Ghost Mother, he could use this opportunity to build a good relationship with the Sweet Dew Monastery.</p><p>Xiaoxing departed, but Lu Zhang stayed behind.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he had something more to say.</p><p>The two watched the Venerable leave and returned to the main hall.</p><p>There was no need to beat around the bush with Lu Zhang.  Qin Sang asked directly, "Did the Sweet Dew Monastery suffer heavy losses?"</p><p>It was worth pondering: if this person was the Ghost Mother, what was her purpose in infiltrating the Sweet Dew Monastery?</p><p>Lu Zhang seemed lost in thought, reacting a beat late. He shook his head.  "The Sweet Dew Monastery has kept this matter extremely confidential.  I couldn't find any information to confirm anything. I've probed a few times, but Xiaoxing remains tight-lipped."</p><p>Give it some time, and clues will surely surface.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't press further and changed the subject. "Do you have a close relationship with Venerable Xiaoxing?"</p><p>"Are you asking about Mount Bunian and the Sweet Dew Monastery?"</p><p>Lu Zhang smiled. "There was once a conflict between Buddhism and Daoism in the Central Continent. But nowadays, the two schools aren't so clearly divided. It's most evident in the Seven Western Provinces. Almost all sects and factions, big or small, have a blend of Buddhist and Daoist influences.  In the Nineteen Provinces of Misty Rain, the closer you get to the edges, the more mixed the lineages become, encompassing Buddhism, Demonic Dao, unorthodox paths, and everything in between. How can they be clearly distinguished? Many disciples on Mount Bunian also cultivate Buddhist divine abilities with considerable success. Perhaps Fellow Daoist should try it sometime; it could lead to new insights.  While the Eight Sceneries Monastery has the standing to contend with the Sweet Dew Monastery for the title of leading Daoist sect, we naturally have to maintain good relations with both. As for doctrinal disputes, no one has mentioned them for a long time."</p><p>Lu Zhang's words matched Qin Sang's observations.</p><p>After learning about the flourishing of both Buddhism and Daoism in the Central Continent, Qin Sang had initially expected a clear division.  Later, he found it to be quite different from his imagination.</p><p>Apart from some cruel and bloodthirsty demonic sects, who acted without restraint and were confined to the Northern Wasteland, there were no clear boundaries between various lineages in the Central Continent.  They intertwined and were difficult to distinguish, with only conflicts of interest remaining.</p><p>When even scriptures are no longer studied, how can there be talk of orthodoxy?</p><p>If this continued, perhaps they would truly merge.</p><p>Of course, this had to do with the stable situation in the Central Continent. Once chaos erupted, no one could guarantee what would happen. Fellow Daoists were natural allies.</p><p>As long as the will of the Nascent Soul cultivators remained, the Central Continent wouldn't fall into chaos.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Zhang changed the subject. "When did Daoist Priest leave the East Sea and travel to the Central Continent?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, sensing something unusual.  He pondered. "It has been nearly a hundred years.  However, even in the East Sea, this poor Daoist, like now, was in seclusion most of the time and rarely went out. My Green Goat Island is east of the Northern Wasteland, a rather remote location, and news travels slowly. Has Fellow Daoist Lu heard something?"</p><p>Over these fifty years, Qin Sang had rarely left Mount Pu.</p><p>Lu Zhang nodded.  "I recall something. It should have been less than two hundred years ago. A rumor emerged that someone had seen someone resembling Sage Huiguang in the outer sea.  Shortly after, a fierce storm erupted in the deep sea, with torrential lightning and apocalyptic scenes even more terrifying than the Storm Belt, precisely in the direction Sage Huiguang had traveled.  The rumors were vague at the time, with no known source, and several versions claimed Sage Huiguang was accompanied by another person, or even more…"</p><p>Pausing, Lu Zhang continued.  "The rumors didn't cause much of a stir. No one believed a venerable Sage would be defeated by mere wind and thunder.  It was dismissed as idle gossip, a joke, and no one paid attention. It only circulated briefly within the East Sea before fading away. I happened to hear it by chance. After Venerable Xiaoxing's visit, I suddenly remembered that rumor and specifically investigated it. Based on the Sweet Dew Monastery's behavior, I suspect the place that person infiltrated was likely the monastery's forbidden ground—Small Dimension Mountain!"</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond, Lu Zhang said gravely, "Sage Huiguang's meditation hall is located on that mountain!"</p><p>"Hiss…"</p><p>Qin Sang realized what Lu Zhang truly meant.</p><p>"Could the one who accompanied Sage Huiguang be…"</p><p>Lu Zhang offered no confirmation, only saying, "Coincidentally, since then, neither Sage Huiguang nor True Monarch Danyu have appeared publicly. They have both been in seclusion."</p><p>"Over a hundred years ago… over a hundred years ago…"</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and paced back and forth.</p><p>Lu Zhang assumed Qin Sang was contemplating the impact the disappearance of two Nascent Soul cultivators would have on the cultivation world.</p><p>In reality, Qin Sang was thinking about something else.</p><p>What had lured Sage Huiguang and True Monarch Danyu to the outer sea so suddenly?</p><p>The Heavenly Same, Heavenly Agreeing celestial halls, the Seven Kill Hall, and the Purple Star Palace were all connected by fragments of the Earth Kill Sword.  To those unaware, wouldn't Old Devil Ye and Qingjun, after ascending with the Purple Star Palace, appear to have vanished without a trace?</p><p>Qin Sang continued to inquire, but because so much time had passed, Lu Zhang, who hadn't believed the rumors at the time, hadn't investigated thoroughly and couldn't provide the exact time or location.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, Lu Zhang stood up, his tone enigmatic. "Let us wait and see when the Sweet Dew Monastery will apprehend the culprit. Otherwise, the credibility of that rumor will greatly increase. I'm certainly not the only one who remembers it.  Unless Sage Huiguang or True Monarch Danyu personally come forward to dispel the rumors, the Central Continent will be in turmoil!"</p><p>Sighing softly, Lu Zhang turned and walked out.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his senses and hurried to see him off.</p><p>After returning, Qin Sang sat in the main hall, deep in thought for a long time before returning to the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>From then on, Qin Sang's avatar no longer remained confined to his cave dwelling.  He frequently ventured out, sometimes disguised under various identities, and sometimes openly visiting Venerable Xiaoxing, probing for news from the Sweet Dew Monastery.</p><p>His purpose in helping the Sweet Dew Monastery find someone was not something to be shared with outsiders.</p><p>His power alone was limited, after all.</p><p>Whether it was because the Sweet Dew Monastery hadn't made any progress or because they had tightened their security, Qin Sang hadn't received any useful information, not even the mysterious person's motive for infiltrating the monastery.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang did travel to many places in the Central Continent, especially the Six Jiangzuo Provinces, witnessing the true splendor of the immortal world and understanding why Daoism thrived so in the Central Continent.</p><p>Spiritual veins in the Central Continent were also known as dragon veins.</p><p>Dragons roamed the Central Continent, and the Six Jiangzuo Provinces were where myriad dragons converged.</p><p>However, hidden beneath this prosperity was a lurking danger.</p><p>Lu Zhang's earlier worries came true.</p><p>The Sweet Dew Monastery's actions caught the attention of those with keen minds, and the old rumors quickly resurfaced. After all, for high-level cultivators, over a hundred years wasn't considered a very distant past.</p><p>The rumors rapidly spread at an alarming rate, gradually gaining traction.</p><p>For a time, the entire world was watching the two great sects.</p><p>Intriguingly, the Eight Sceneries Monastery remained silent throughout.</p><p>The Sweet Dew Monastery also seemed to realize that they had inadvertently stirred up a major storm, and their search for the mysterious person became more cautious.</p><p>As the rumors intensified, True Monarch Danyu and Sage Huiguang remained absent, and the two sects offered no response.</p><p>To outsiders, it was undoubtedly an unspoken confirmation.</p><p>For many years, the Central Continent had enjoyed stability, and no immediate chaos was apparent.</p><p>But seasoned cultivators like Qin Sang understood that without Nascent Soul cultivators as a deterrent, some individuals with ulterior motives would lose their greatest fear and would eventually be tempted to act.</p><p>Qin Sang strictly ordered the Xie family and Tower Terrace disciples not to leave Fuddu Commandery, and he himself became more cautious in his actions.</p><p>Due to this turn of events, probing the Sweet Dew Monastery became even more difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang searched tirelessly.</p><p>It wasn't until several years later that he learned a few sage monks from the Sweet Dew Monastery had journeyed to the Western Desert together.</p><p>By the time he received the news, those sage monks had already returned, and it was uncertain whether Sage Huiguang was among them. The Sweet Dew Monastery ceased its search and closed its gates, entering seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang could only hope that the Ghost Mother hadn't been killed by the Sweet Dew Monastery.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>More than twenty years had passed since Xiaoxing's visit to Mount Pu.</p><p>Qin Sang's original body continued his dedicated cultivation.</p><p>His avatar, after failing to find anyone, also returned to the mountain to cultivate.</p><p>On the Fu River.</p><p>A treasure ship sailed out of the estuary.</p><p>Leaving the calm river and entering the East Sea, it was immediately battered by waves.</p><p>At this moment, countless runes lit up on the ship's hull, bathing it in a cyan glow. The wooden hull instantly turned jade-green, as if imbued with new life.</p><p>This layer of light wasn't just for show; it also provided defense.</p><p>The impact of the waves was absorbed by the cyan light. The ship shuddered slightly before regaining stability, unaffected by the turbulent waters.</p><p>"Hmm, inscribing the formation onto the hull…  The hull isn't made of spiritwood, but coated with a special lacquer that can absorb true essence and be sustained by spirit stones.  It's quite similar to the North Sea…"</p><p>In a first-class cabin, a man leaned against the window, his gaze fixed on the distant sea, yet fully aware of the changes happening beneath the ship.</p><p>This man, with a feather fan and silk scarf, was dressed as a scholar, the very image of a refined gentleman.</p><p>It was Qin Sang's external avatar.</p><p>Unable to find the Ghost Mother, Qin Sang could only focus his energy on another matter.</p><p>This voyage was to find the source of the rumors and see if he could uncover anything.</p><p>The ship belonged to a merchant guild. Its fully activated formation could withstand the onslaught of storms at sea, and there were cultivators onboard to ensure safe passage.</p><p>It wasn't top-tier, not as good as the Six Provinces Hall, but its advantage lay in its long-range capabilities, reaching the edge of the Inner Sea.</p><p>Upon entering the East Sea,</p><p>Numerous treasure ships sailed towards them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't need to actively sense it to realize that almost every ship had cultivators onboard.</p><p>"Was it always like this, or have even those outside the Central Continent sensed an opportunity and gathered here?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself.</p>
