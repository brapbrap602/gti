<h1>Chapter 1211: Ye Lao Mo</h1><p>Chapter 1211: Ye Lao Mo</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath, quickly retrieving the twelve demonic banners and the white bronze.  He didn't have time to examine them; merging with his spirit sword, he instantly shifted sideways.</p><p>The green light finally materialized, narrowly missing Qin Sang's back.</p><p>The near miss sent a jolt of fear through Qin Sang.  </p><p>Nevertheless, he had succeeded in obtaining the white bronze, remaining in control. He hoped the white bronze wouldn't disappoint him.</p><p>The treasure acquisition happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>The intense pain and the revenge for the stolen treasure drove the evil spirit into a frenzy.  Its hatred for Qin Sang surpassed even its hatred for the Serpent King and his companions.</p><p>This was excellent news for the Serpent King's group.</p><p>While Qin Sang was acting, they hadn't been idle.</p><p>The Lu cultivator and the ice lizard worked together to impede the evil spirit's long tail, then, seizing the moment when the evil spirit's attention was on Qin Sang, they both dashed toward the abyssal exit below.</p><p>The Serpent King, using some unknown secret technique, wielded his black blade with ferocious power, fighting two opponents at once, forcing Jiang Chenzi and the other cultivator into a desperate defensive posture.</p><p>The other Yuan Ying from the Abyss seemed to only just realize what happened, frantically summoning his treasure—a banner identical to Jiang Chenzi's.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang seize the treasure right before their eyes, the three Yuan Ying from the Abyss were shocked by his displayed power and his treasure, whose remarkable effectiveness even restrained the evil spirit. They were also furious.  They had long considered the treasure within the serpent spirit their own.</p><p>This person’s sudden appearance had not only ruined their favorable situation but had also stolen a treasure, all while they could only watch helplessly.</p><p>The Serpent King felt quite differently.</p><p>He, too, was astonished by Qin Sang's hidden strength. He found it laughable that he had allowed the Qieji Yao Wang to gamble with him; even if he had personally participated, he likely wouldn't have had much chance of winning.</p><p>After forcing back Jiang Chenzi and his companion, the Serpent King immediately recalled his black blade and rushed towards the exit, following the ice lizard and the Lu cultivator. He urgently transmitted a message, "Friend, your methods are impressive! We can't stay here long, let's go!"</p><p>Despite witnessing Qin Sang's ability to restrain the evil spirit, the Serpent King and his companions didn't offer to help him acquire more treasure.</p><p>Firstly, the evil spirit, though its intelligence had been obliterated by its malevolence, was not inanimate.  Its instincts remained. Using the same method twice would be far less effective.  Further entanglement would prolong the process indefinitely.</p><p>Secondly, they had already obtained what seemed to be the most important treasure, making it unnecessary to risk their lives for two items of unknown use.</p><p>Those who cultivated to this level surely understood the importance of making the right choices.</p><p>The Serpent King kindly reminded Qin Sang to leave with them.</p><p>While Qin Sang's primary goal was the treasure, he had undeniably saved them in a moment of crisis; they felt obligated to express their gratitude.</p><p>Qin Sang was desperately dodging the evil spirit's pursuit.</p><p>Facing the evil spirit alone, Qin Sang felt the pressure mounting.  He had encountered a demon lord at the Seven Kills Hall, but he hadn't directly confronted it—that had been left to Qingzhu and the other experts. This evil spirit was, without a doubt, his most formidable opponent to date.</p><p>Hearing the Serpent King's message, Qin Sang silently nodded.</p><p>He was right; the Serpent King and his companions did possess a secret passage into the abyss, which he initially assumed was in the blood lake, but was actually below.  Qin Sang immediately suppressed his escaping light and followed the Serpent King towards the exit.</p><p>He had already thoroughly searched the Tian Shi Sect headquarters, making it easy to leave from here; there was no need to take the longer route.</p><p>At this point, the Lu cultivator and the ice lizard arrived at the exit ahead of them. Qin Sang and the Serpent King were slightly behind, pursued by the serpent spirit and the Abyss Yuan Ying respectively.</p><p>Just as the Lu cultivator and the ice lizard were about to enter the exit, Qin Sang felt an ominous premonition.</p><p>"Something's wrong! What have I overlooked?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened.</p><p>The feeling was intense, as if some danger was lurking nearby, undetected by him.</p><p>This was the Abyss's lair; Qin Sang would never be careless.</p><p>Before acting, he had even activated the Wu tribe's insect control secret technique, enhancing the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's abilities to examine the surrounding area inch by inch, ensuring that no one else was hidden and that no other Yuan Ying were approaching.</p><p>During the battle, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly remained constantly vigilant.</p><p>Despite such careful and thorough preparation, an oversight still occurred.</p><p>The instant these thoughts crossed Qin Sang's mind, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly sent a strong warning.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>Behind the battlefield, the calm blood lake suddenly churned.</p><p>A blood-colored storm instantly formed.</p><p>The blood gathered into towering waves, forming a blood-red gate in mid-air.</p><p>A figure emerged from a swirling pool of blood within the Blood Gate, seemingly slow but swiftly moving.  Simultaneously, the exit was unexpectedly flooded, engulfing the cold lizard and the Lu cultivator who were caught off guard.</p><p>Jiang Shenzi and the others showed no surprise.  Abandoning the chase, they quickly separated, each raising a magical banner to form a three-person formation, a blood-red flag array.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivator hiding nearby had previously appeared clumsy.  The Snake King and others assumed this was due to Qin Sang's swift attack and the rapid change in the situation, catching the cultivator off guard and unprepared.</p><p>However, the cultivator's sharp movements now revealed the earlier clumsiness as a deception.  The pursuit by Jiang Shenzi and the others was a ruse, intended to lull their opponent into a false sense of security, waiting for this precise moment.</p><p>The figure’s face became clear as they flew from the Blood Gate.</p><p>“Lord Ye!”</p><p>Recognizing the individual, the Snake King gasped, his expression changing drastically.  He and Qin Sang stopped just in time.  Fortunately, they were behind the Lu cultivator and the cold lizard, allowing them to halt their advance and avoid the blood flood.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze sharpened at the Snake King's cry.  Lord Ye here?</p><p>Lord Ye’s cunning surprise attack on the Purple Micro Palace years ago, nearly annihilating high-level cultivators from both regions, was vividly etched in Qin Sang's memory.  His cultivation was comparable to that of the Red-Haired Ancestor and Zhen Yi, both close to the Grand Cultivator realm, yet he was considered a lifelong enemy, feared by them all.</p><p>The devastation of the Northern Star Realm was largely orchestrated by Lord Ye, his relentless war effort leaving the land in ruins. Qin Sang, despite his abilities, knew few figures in the Northern Star Realm worthy of his caution – Lord Ye was undeniably one of them, best avoided.</p><p>However, since the war’s start, Lord Ye had remained at the front lines.  It was said Zhen Yi had personally engaged him in battle.  Believing Lord Ye was tied up at the front, Qin Sang and the Snake King had dared to infiltrate the Abyssal Ruins.  No one expected Lord Ye to suddenly appear from the Blood Lake.</p><p>Moreover, Lord Ye didn’t seem to have just arrived. His energy was deeply intertwined with the Blood Lake, suggesting a long presence there.</p><p>“Could there be two peak Yuan Ying mid-stage Lord Yes?”</p><p>Qin Sang considered the absurd thought.</p>
