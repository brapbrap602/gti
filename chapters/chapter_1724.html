<h1>Chapter 1715: The Great Sage Dragon Whale</h1><p>The avatar, having recuperated in the cave dwelling for several days, continued his routine, frequenting the Dewdrop Zen Monastery's Scripture Pavilion and other such places, voraciously devouring scrolls and scriptures, seeking enlightenment.</p><p>Some of the scriptures seemed unrelated to cultivation, yet contained profound truths, their true meaning comprehensible only to those who had reached a certain level of understanding.</p><p>High-level cultivators all had to undergo this process.</p><p>Legend had it that some exceptionally gifted individuals could achieve enlightenment in a single moment, without the need for worldly travels or the aid of any treasures.</p><p>The avatar's public identity was Daoist Clearwind, still considered a newly ascended Grand Cultivator. The Dewdrop Zen Monastery had opened its doors wide for him, and it would be unusual not to seize this opportunity.</p><p>Including the monastery's Holy Monks, no one suspected the avatar's true intentions, and no one could have imagined that Qin Sang's true body had already broken through to the Deity Transformation stage!</p><p>He wished to find body cultivation secrets similar to the *Seven Masters' Buddha Seal* within the Scripture Pavilion and also to investigate the origins of the jade Buddha. The Dewdrop Zen Monastery was the leading Buddhist authority in this realm; if the answer wasn't here, he might only be able to unravel the jade Buddha's mystery in the Upper Realm.</p><p>Unfortunately, after perusing all the Buddhist scriptures collected by the monastery, he couldn't find any Buddha or Bodhisattva that corresponded to the jade Buddha.</p><p>Of course, the avatar's more important purpose was to investigate the movements of the Holy Sage Huiguang.</p><p>Unable to find a justifiable reason to visit Mount Microcosm and pay respects to the Holy Sage, the avatar started from the bottom, actively engaging other eminent monks in discussions, conversing about everything under the heavens and debating the Dao.</p><p>Through indirect inquiries and information gathered from various sources,</p><p>The avatar confirmed that the Holy Sage Huiguang's last appearance was seventy years ago.</p><p>Seventy years prior, during the grand celebration of the newly formed Tri-Sect Alliance, the Holy Sage Huiguang had made a divine appearance, while the Holy King Azurefox observed, their combined presence aweing the assembled sects.</p><p>Since then, the Deity Transformation expert had vanished without a trace.</p><p>It was said that the Dewdrop Zen Monastery had voluntarily yielded certain benefits within the alliance agreement. The Eight Sceneries View and the Skyhowling Tower, previously at odds with the monastery, were now unexpectedly united. Those who sought to sow discord found no opportunity to intervene.</p><p>During this period, some individuals mysteriously disappeared.</p><p>With other sects either acquiescing or joining in, there was naturally no longer a need for a Deity Transformation expert to intervene.</p><p>After understanding the rules of the Tri-Sect Alliance, the avatar was certain.</p><p>Given the current situation where no new Deity Transformation cultivators could emerge in this realm, unless a particular sect experienced a drastic decline, or an irreconcilable conflict arose between the three major sects, forcing them to tear up the alliance agreement, it would be difficult for the cultivation world to descend into chaos.</p><p>After that, there seemed to be no significant actions from the Dewdrop Zen Monastery that bore the mark of the Holy Sage Huiguang.</p><p>"Could they be so impatient that they've already crossed eastward to the Returning Ruins?"</p><p>Just as the avatar was pondering what excuse to use to meet with the Holy Sage Huiguang and confirm this matter,</p><p>Unexpectedly, news arrived from the East Sea first.</p><p>The East Sea's妖族 were in turmoil!</p><p>...</p><p>In the Central Continent, human cultivators were mostly concentrated on land, with a weaker presence in the East Sea. This was the result of a tacit understanding between the two races, with the妖族 rarely crossing the border, and years of recuperation and growth.</p><p>Legend had it that when humanity was weak, the East Sea, North Sea, and South Sea were all territories of the妖族.妖beasts roamed the coast, beast tides frequently surged onto land, preying on humans, and no one dared venture out to sea.</p><p>To this day, the sea areas controlled by humanity were only a negligible portion, roughly divided into three layers based on the distribution of islands.</p><p>The outermost layer was undoubtedly the most dangerous, bordering the妖族 territory, but also the easiest place to encounter妖beasts. Cultivators confident in their strength would come here to hunt, and vice versa.</p><p>No one knew for sure whether they were the hunter or the hunted, hence this area was also known as the Hunting Grounds of the Two Races.</p><p>East of the Northern Wilderness, over the vast sea, a lone figure traveled on a cloud, neither hurried nor slow, making no attempt at concealment.</p><p>This was tantamount to courting death.</p><p>This area was already within the Hunting Grounds, where every hunter proceeded with extreme caution, either calling upon companions or concealing their presence. No one had seen such arrogance.</p><p>If a group of powerful妖 were attracted, this person would surely meet their demise.</p><p>Strangely, even as this person ventured deeper into the Hunting Grounds, not a single妖beast attacked him.</p><p>Within the Hunting Grounds.</p><p>Two figures flew out from a nameless small island.</p><p>Both were Nascent Soul Patriarchs, yet they faced westward, standing respectfully in the void, as if awaiting some important personage, showing no impatience despite the long wait.</p><p>Finally, a figure appeared in the west. The two faces lit up with joy and hurried forward. "Greetings, Master!"</p><p>The newcomer was Qin Sang's true body.</p><p>Back on the island, upon Qin Sang's inquiry about the turmoil among the East Sea妖族, the two replied, "Reporting to Master, as per your instructions, we have infiltrated the妖族 multiple times, secretly clearing obstacles for Long Yi and Long Er, helping them gain a foothold in the East Sea. Long Yi and Long San have even infiltrated the ranks of a妖King. The internal strife within the妖族 is undeniable..."</p><p>Long Yi and Long Er were the names Qin Sang had given to several Earthbound Dragons.</p><p>Listening to the detailed report from the Nethermoon Guard,</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, lost in thought.</p><p>According to the information relayed by Long Yi and the other妖, the warring parties were the Holy King's Palace and a faction of powerful妖族 led by the Great Sage Dragon Whale. The fact that the Dragon Whale was still called a Great Sage indicated that it hadn't reached Deity Transformation.  These妖族, lacking a Deity Transformation expert, dared to challenge the Holy King's Palace!</p><p>Even stranger, the Dragon Whale's rebellion had persisted for so long, yet not only had it not been suppressed by the Holy King Azurefox, but the Holy King's Palace was gradually retreating.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered the Holy King Azurefox claiming indifference to the lives of his followers, but such tolerance seemed too strange.</p><p>...</p><p>In the depths of the East Sea.</p><p>The sky and sea merged into one.</p><p>On the boundless azure surface, a white line suddenly appeared in the north, advancing at an alarming speed, surging forward with the momentum of collapsing mountains.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the white line turned out to be a monstrous wave, thousands of feet high.</p><p>Between the waves, dark shadows flickered, rising and falling in the water. Even without seeing their full forms, the exposed ridges hinted at the immensity of their bodies.</p><p>The ridges were long and slender, resembling fish.</p><p>Indeed, these were Dragon Whales, infamous throughout the East Sea.</p><p>Legend had it that Dragon Whales were ferocious, their roars echoing for thousands of miles, all妖 scattering in their wake. Now, a pod of whales was on the move, yet there were no roars, only the deafening thunder of crashing waves as they silently sped through the water.</p><p>Behind the pod, a massive dark shadow followed closely.</p><p>The shadow was square, covered by a black cloth, with black ropes extending from it, tied to the tails of the whales, pulled along by the pod.</p><p>The black cloth was soft, seemingly composed of some peculiar spiritual water.</p><p>As they sped along, the black cloth billowed in the wind, completely concealing what lay beneath, preventing any leakage of aura.</p><p>At the front of the pod, a burly man sat atop the leading Dragon Whale.</p><p>The man had a broad nose and wide mouth, his powerful frame exuding strength.  Any word describing physical prowess could be applied to him without exaggeration.</p><p>He was dozing with his eyes closed.</p><p>Suddenly, as if sensing something, the man's eyes snapped open, like two bolts of lightning splitting the void. The sunlight on the sea surface seemed to dim for an instant.</p><p>Where the man's gaze fell, a faint mist rose from the sea.</p><p>Compared to the menacing wave, this mist appeared weak and insignificant.</p><p>Yet, the man's pupils contracted like needles.</p><p>In the next moment, light and shadow shifted within the mist, a faint figure flickering in and out of view.</p><p>Upon seeing the figure, the man suddenly leaped into the air, raising his arms and letting out a sky-shattering roar.  A whale song overwhelmed the sound of the waves, yet it lacked any ethereal or resonant quality, instead sharp and filled with malice.</p><p>Hearing the roar,</p><p>The whales abruptly halted, their forward momentum ceasing instantly.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The thousand-foot wave crashed down.</p><p>Immediately afterward, sharp cries erupted as water columns shot towards the heavens.</p><p>The whales scattered, forming a whale formation, leaving a large area empty in the center for the man, as if guarding him.</p><p>At the same time, the whales pulled together, lifting the massive dark shadow behind them high into the air, suspending it above the forest of water columns.</p><p>The figure in the mist seemed oblivious to the arrayed whales, unmoved, its form gradually becoming clearer within the mist.</p><p>This person sat cross-legged atop a black lotus of fire.</p><p>The fire lotus carried him, slowly rising from the sea. Compared to any of the Dragon Whales, he appeared incredibly frail, yet he dared to stand before the entire pod.</p><p>The whales stopped for him, as if facing a formidable foe!</p><p>His face was still unclear, but he seemed to be wearing a blue Daoist robe, his long hair flowing behind him.</p><p>Despite his presence, the whales, once they closed their eyes, sensed nothing unusual, as if he had merged with the heavens and earth.</p><p>The burly man stared intently at the mist, roaring furiously as his bones cracked and his body swelled.</p><p>In an instant, a mountainous dark shadow appeared on the sea, also a Dragon Whale, but its aura and size dwarfed the others, like the difference between a mountain and a hill.</p><p>The man was the East Sea's foremost Great Sage—the Great Sage Dragon Whale!</p><p>He defied the Holy King's Palace, leading his followers into rebellion, but unexpectedly encountered this mysterious person.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Great Sage Dragon Whale revealed his true form. A flick of his tail sent enormous waves crashing outwards, and he opened his massive maw, roaring furiously, "You Daoist, state your name! This King has no quarrel with you, why do you block my path?!"</p><p>The other remained silent.</p><p>Only the mist drifted.</p><p>His outline gradually sharpened.</p><p>The Great Sage Dragon Whale's gaze was drawn to the black lotus beneath the figure, his huge eyes suddenly narrowing. He slammed his tail against the sea surface, and the whales, receiving his command, roared in response.</p><p>Their bodies tensed, pulling hard on the ropes attached to their tails.</p><p>The dark shadow in the air swayed, and with a 'whoosh', the black cloth was pulled back, revealing an iron cage within. Inside the cage lay a blood-red skeleton.</p><p>The skeleton was stripped of flesh, yet it dripped with a crimson hue, as if perpetually soaked in blood.</p><p>The skeleton was complete, its skull long and pointed, with blood congealing in its eye sockets, adding to its eerie appearance. Judging by its shape, it was likely the remains of another Dragon Whale.</p><p>'Clatter...clatter...'</p><p>The ropes strained, the iron cage shaking.</p><p>With the black cloth removed, a bloody aura soared skyward, a terrifyingly ferocious presence filling the heavens and earth, as if a monstrous beast was about to awaken, inspiring dread.</p><p>This aura connected with the whale pod and the Great Sage Dragon Whale, erupting from them as a terrifying pressure, directed towards the figure ahead.</p><p>Only when the Great Sage Dragon Whale revealed the skeleton</p><p>Did the figure in the mist seem to show interest, slightly raising his head to examine the skeleton in the iron cage, and letting out a chuckle: "Is this your reliance?"</p><p>The casual tone infuriated the Great Sage Dragon Whale, who roared, "Don't be so arrogant!  Daoist, you luckily reached Deity Transformation, yet instead of ascending, you dare to come to the East Sea to stir up trouble! Are you not afraid of having no return, throwing away millennia of arduous cultivation?! This King's ninety-nine sons are all here.  Should I command them to reverse their blood flow and self-destruct, awakening the Chaotic Reverse Whale, you will surely be gravely injured, your path to ascension severed..."</p><p>The other, confident in his cultivation, made no attempt at concealment.</p><p>The Great Sage Dragon Whale had confirmed that the other was a human Deity Transformation cultivator.</p><p>His threat was somewhat exaggerated, but not entirely bluster. Daring to challenge the Holy King's Palace, the Great Sage Dragon Whale naturally had his own trump card.</p><p>The iron cage could be opened at any moment, a bloody aura constantly flowing within the skeleton, its crimson hue deepening with each cycle.</p><p>Furthermore, he had secretly sent a message to his allies.</p><p>His allies were not far from here.</p><p>Although they suspected that the Holy King Azurefox had already crossed eastward to ascend, out of caution, since the start of their rebellion, they always traveled with their followers whenever they left their cave dwellings.</p><p>As his roar faded, the Great Sage Dragon Whale finally saw the face of the figure in the mist. His expression faltered, and he exclaimed in surprise, "It's you?"</p><p>"You know me?"</p><p>Qin Sang revealed his true face within the dissipating mist, looking at the Great Sage Dragon Whale.</p><p>The Great Sage's expression flickered, and he said coldly, "The renowned Fire Devil, how could this King not know you?"</p><p>During the battle at the Formless Immortal Sect, the Fire Devil had resisted the妖族 Holy King, unleashing a Firebird that annihilated the Holy King's illusionary body. This feat was not only widely discussed among humans, but also reached the East Sea妖族.</p><p>The Great Sage Dragon Whale, always rebellious, closely followed the Holy King Azurefox's movements, naturally investigating this matter thoroughly.</p><p>Learning that the Holy King Azurefox had provoked such a powerful enemy, the Great Sage Dragon Whale was secretly delighted and even considered contacting Qin Sang to join forces against the Holy King.</p><p>However, Qin Sang remained secluded in Deer Wild.</p><p>The Great Sage Dragon Whale couldn't spare much attention and temporarily shelved the idea.</p><p>Never did he expect that after over a hundred years, this person would reappear, having already transcended their realm!</p><p>Rumors said that while this person displayed great power at the Formless Immortal Sect, his strength lay in his divine abilities and treasures, his cultivation likely having only recently broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The Great Sage Dragon Whale thought about himself, trapped at the Deity Transformation bottleneck for over a thousand years, and couldn't help but feel a pang of envy.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, Fellow Daoist has achieved the venerable rank of True Monarch in such a short time.  This King must offer his admiration!"</p><p>Having confirmed Qin Sang's identity, the Great Sage Dragon Whale's tone softened somewhat.</p><p>Since this person was the Fire Devil, it was impossible for him to be allied with the Holy King Azurefox.</p><p>The enemy of one's enemy is a friend!</p><p>The Fire Devil had nearly perished at the hands of the Fox妖; he didn't believe the Fire Devil would simply swallow his pride.</p><p>He had endured humiliation and finally achieved Deity Transformation, wouldn't he seek revenge?</p><p>If he could win this person over, their cause would be greatly aided!</p><p>Qin Sang keenly perceived the change in the Great Sage Dragon Whale's tone and smiled, "It seems the Great Sage has already guessed this humble Daoist's intentions."</p><p>The Great Sage Dragon Whale reverted to his human form, taking a long look at Qin Sang.  His throat pulsed, emitting a low growl of unclear meaning.</p><p>The whale pod behind him erupted into chaos, the whales lunging at the surrounding Shark Guard like hungry tigers, instantly transforming the area into a sea of blood, leaving only the Dragon Whale himself.</p><p>The Great Sage Dragon Whale said coldly, "True Monarch shouldn't want to reveal his presence just yet, right?  This King's followers can be trusted."</p><p>...</p><p>Unnamed妖 Island.</p><p>The Great Sage Dragon Whale sat upon a high chair.</p><p>Below him sat two rows of妖Kings, all allies in his rebellion.</p><p>Due to a single sentence from the Great Sage Dragon Whale's general, the assembled妖 were engaged in a heated debate.</p><p>"We still can't be certain that the sly fox has truly ascended. If we force the Holy King's Palace into a decisive battle now, aren't we cornering her?"</p><p>"Indeed! We follow the Great Sage because that sly fox is too tyrannical, monopolizing several sacred grounds. Now that the Holy King's Palace is steadily retreating and the sacred grounds are within reach, why complicate matters?"</p><p>...</p><p>The Great Sage Dragon Whale silently observed the arguing妖.</p>
