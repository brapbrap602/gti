Chapter 449: External Elixirs


“Are you jesting, friend?”


Manager Bao’s jowls trembled; he couldn’t contain himself and slammed the table!


“The value of rare treasures and spirit materials that aid in Golden Core cultivation needs no explanation from me!


“Just considering a demon pill that has remained active for less than ten years after being removed from the beast’s body…if I had the ability to kill a demon beast at the Demon Pill stage, why would I need your living corpses?


“Furthermore, legend speaks of a secret method that allows the creation of external elixirs using this kind of demon pill.  Wouldn’t it be simpler for me to trade directly with a Golden Core cultivator?


“Demanding living corpses in exchange…are you perhaps trying to make fun of me, friend? Did I unintentionally say something offensive?”


Manager Bao was furious, reprimanding Qin Sang.


Qin Sang chuckled. He certainly knew that hoping to exchange living corpses for a demon pill that had remained active for less than ten years was a fool’s errand.


Tapping his fingers on the table, Qin Sang calmly said, “Manager Bao says that only active demon pills are unacceptable…so, is there still a chance if it’s an ordinary demon pill?”


“You…”


Manager Bao opened his mouth, scrutinized Qin Sang for a moment, then sat back down, his head slightly lowered, seemingly lost in thought.


After a long while, Manager Bao raised his head and asked solemnly, “How many living corpses can you provide?”


Qin Sang looked at Manager Bao in surprise.  Did this person actually have a solution?


Considering the difficulty of creating living corpses, Qin Sang sighed softly and said, “I can't say for sure; even one is difficult…however, I can promise you this: If I ever obtain one, your shop will be the first place I come to.”


“Good! A deal!”


Having received Qin Sang’s promise, Manager Bao immediately forgot his displeasure, his face brightening with joy.  “I will eagerly await your good news, friend!”


After leaving the shop, Qin Sang glanced back.


Unexpectedly, he saw a glimmer of hope regarding the Flying Night Rakshasa here.


He didn't expect to buy a demon pill that had remained active for less than ten years, but even an ordinary demon pill seemed unlikely.


He had the ability to kill cultivators at the False Core stage, but the most powerful living corpse embryo in his Corpse Puppet Pouch was only at the Foundation Establishment Late stage – certainly insufficient for Manager Bao’s needs.


This person was a remnant of the Kuiyin Sect, one of the Four Flame Envoys of the Demon Flame Gate.


Cultivators from Little Cold Region had been conscripted, and the Demon Flame Gate was no exception.


The battlefield was the perfect place for disposing of corpses and wouldn't arouse the suspicion of Daoist Jiupao.


Qin Sang had been monitoring the movements of the Kuiyin Sect remnants.  He would create opportunities where none existed, quietly eliminating Daoist Jiupao’s lackeys to delay his recovery as much as possible.


Most of the Demon Flame Gate cultivators who perished here had died at Qin Sang’s hands.


Capturing a False Core stage expert alive and refining them into a living corpse…it was hard to say which was more difficult, that or finding a demon pill.


It simply meant that more avenues meant more hope.


Qin Sang left Mist Island, was teleported to another location within the large array, and flew on a cloud back to his cave abode to resume his seclusion.


In his cave, a light flickered on and off.


The spiritual energy of a batch of spirit stones was depleted, turning them into worthless stones.


Qin Sang remained with his eyes closed, unhesitatingly activating a new batch.  He had done this countless times; it no longer pained him as much as before.


After several cycles of his cultivation technique, Qin Sang’s consciousness left his Nascent Soul space, looked at his storage pouch, and finally took out two vials of spirit pills.


These were two vials of Leaving Dragon Pills he had obtained from Yu Hua’s belongings, which he had been reluctant to use.


He opened the jade vial, the fragrance of the pills filling the air.


Qin Sang greedily inhaled several times.  With a flick of his finger, a pill flew out and landed precisely in his mouth.


The pill transformed into a warm current, flowing through his body.  Qin Sang felt his cultivation rapidly improving, sighed silently, and then re-entered meditation to refine the pill’s energy.


Days turned into weeks.


Mu Yifeng and the others returned from their mission, reported to Stargazing Island, left a flying talisman at Qin Sang's cave entrance, and then went their separate ways.


Under the arrangement of Stargazing Island, all the teams took turns patrolling and searching for spatial fluctuations.


After completing their missions, they had some free time before the next assignment.


Qin Sang knew nothing of what was happening outside; he focused intently on refining the Leaving Dragon Pills.  One by one, the pills in the jade vials diminished until the first vial was empty.


Soon, the second vial was also empty.


Qin Sang continued his cultivation, expertly gathering spiritual energy to grasp another pill, but his hand came up empty. He suddenly awoke, staring blankly at the empty vial, finally sighing softly.


The effectiveness of the Leaving Dragon Pills was undeniable.  After consuming two vials, Qin Sang's cultivation had improved significantly.


Unfortunately, he still had a considerable distance to cover before reaching the False Core stage.


"It'll probably take another two years..."

Qin Sang checked his spiritual energy, estimating his cultivation progress.  Without the aid of elixirs, he needed another two years of intensive cultivation to reach the peak of his current stage and break through to the next realm.  Using elixirs would speed things up, of course.

Reaching the next realm would allow him to start preparing for the subsequent breakthrough.  But he still hadn't found the necessary spiritual materials for that.

It had been just over ten years since he'd broken through to the later stages of his current cultivation level, not counting the time wasted investigating the Mo Yan Sect. Thanks to the "Sword Cultivation through the Soul" technique and various elixirs, his cultivation speed was among the fastest of those at his level.

He had, after all, spent over thirty years stuck at an earlier stage, only breaking through with the help of a potent elixir.  Still, Qin Sang wasn't satisfied. News from the ancient battlefield kept pouring in – the Seven Heroes Pass was completely sealed off, the spiritual surge had begun and was intensifying.

Most worrying was the situation in the Yun Cang Marsh. This fragile peace couldn't last forever; Qin Sang sensed the undercurrents of conflict. He didn't know what the Xiao Han Domain and the Tian Xing League were searching for, but their discovery would likely trigger a major war.

He'd dedicated himself to cultivation, never relaxing, sacrificing everything to acquire resources, just to catch up.  In the coming chaos, every bit of extra strength would mean a greater chance of survival.

"Time is running out!"

Qin Sang clenched his fists, his mind a whirlwind of complex thoughts before he calmed himself and entered a meditative state.

Unexpectedly, after only two days of undisturbed cultivation, he was jolted awake by the unusual activation of his communication token.

Qin Sang's face changed drastically. He hastily retrieved the token and saw it blazing with an intense, almost blinding, red light.  Red light signified the most urgent of orders – large-scale battles involving thousands of people. He'd seen it frequently in the first year, but this was the first time in the past year.

Qin Sang's expression shifted between anger and anxiety.  He couldn't help but curse,

"...Why couldn't they wait two more years?!"

Despite his frustration, he dared not disobey. He quickly gathered his spirit stones and cast one last look at the cave where he'd spent three years.  The sudden interruption of his long period of peace was an ominous sign.

When Qin Sang opened the entrance, Mu Yi Feng and the others were already assembled outside, ready to depart. Like Qin Sang, they were worried, their faces etched with apprehension and unease.

After a headcount, Qin Sang gave the order.

"Let's go!"
