<h1>Chapter 1921: Chaotic Times</h1><p>Qin Sang's deduction pointed to three locations, one of which lay west of the Leixiao Sect, and it was in that direction they now traveled.</p><p>Crossing towering mountains and vast ridges, reaching new kingdoms, they sometimes flew through the heavens, occasionally descending to the earth.  At times, they walked among mortals, at others, they visited spirits and deities. Their pace was quicker than before, as Qin Sang wished to find the ritual altars swiftly and ascertain their true origins and purpose.</p><p>The lands they traversed, perhaps not prosperous, were at least stable, the people able to make ends meet and live in peace.</p><p>The further west they journeyed, however, the more unsettling the situation became.</p><p>Qin Sang directly perceived a palpable tension in several strategically important border towns, signs of frequent warfare.</p><p>Continuing westward, dilapidated, ruined cities and deserted villages began to appear, devoid of human presence.</p><p>Especially in remote areas, temples and divine statues had collapsed, long abandoned and devoid of incense offerings.  Some statues were decapitated, others utterly crumbled into dust, an aura of desolation permeating the air.</p><p>Along their path, the power of the Divine Dao grew progressively weaker.</p><p>In some places, the strength of a County City God, let alone comparing with Gao Ruoxu, wasn't even on par with a normal County City God of the Liu Kingdom.</p><p>Some monstrous creatures descended from the mountains, preying on mortals, and the Divine Dao dared not venture out of the towns to suppress them, even fearing for their own safety when encountering powerful demons.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Yanshui Temple Master's warning.  As they traveled west, they drew closer to the Muluo Mountain Range, a place teeming with countless demons and steeped in chaos. Even the cultivators of the Yundu Mountain spoke of it with dread, and even the mighty Yundu Tian couldn't purge the Muluo Mountains.</p><p>It seemed the mortal world was also influenced by the cultivation world. The closer to Yundu Tian, the more stable the region.</p><p>Following this trend, the situation ahead would only worsen!</p><p>The reality proved Qin Sang's prediction correct.</p><p>On this day, as they flew through the sky, Qin Sang's gaze swept across the ground below, and he suddenly pointed towards a mountain peak ahead.</p><p>"Descend."</p><p>Luo Hou immediately withdrew the demonic wind, gently landing on the summit. Qin Sang and Xiao Wu dismounted, the surrounding scenery unfolding before their eyes.</p><p>This place, at a glance, clearly hadn't seen rain for a long time.</p><p>The mountain was barren, and where there was withered grass, it was a scorched yellow, devoid of any hint of green or moisture, tinder-dry, though autumn was still some time away.</p><p>The sun had just begun its descent, and the earth still emanated a burnt odor.</p><p>Below the mountain lay a dirt road.</p><p>Hot winds whipped up the yellow dust on the road, sending plumes of dust swirling into the air.</p><p>The dirt road was noticeably flat and wide, unlike the rugged mountain paths commonly found in rural areas.  It had originally been meticulously constructed as an official state road.</p><p>Despite the lingering heat of the sun, the dirt road was already teeming with people, slowly shuffling forward, heedless of the scorching sun and the choking dust.</p><p>These people were neither merchants nor soldiers.</p><p>Almost all were gaunt and emaciated, their clothes tattered and filthy, some even skeletal, their steps trembling, as if they might collapse at any moment.  They had abandoned all their belongings, supporting themselves with wooden staffs, driven onward only by sheer willpower.</p><p>Their heads were covered with rags or leaves, some directly exposed to the blazing sun, their expressions vacant, like walking corpses.</p><p>They were clearly refugees.</p><p>Behind them on the official road, a long, winding line of people stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><p>So many people fleeing their homes, there must have been either a devastating famine or a war ahead.</p><p>Such a scene wasn't unfamiliar to Qin Sang. Before entering the world of cultivation, he had witnessed similar sights.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A gust of hot wind swept in from nowhere, kicking up vast clouds of yellow dust.</p><p>"Cough…"</p><p>"Cough, cough!"</p><p>Amidst a chorus of coughs, people covered their mouths and noses, closing their eyes, waiting for the malevolent wind to subside.</p><p>"Waaah!"</p><p>A child's cry suddenly pierced the air, then choked, resuming its wails once the wind passed.</p><p>Like the surrounding people, even the child's cries were weak, fading after a few sobs.</p><p>Beside the child, a woman with a square cloth wrapped around her head, her face caked with yellow dust, obscuring her features, stood.</p><p>She was presumably the child's mother, her rough hand gripping the child's wrist.</p><p>The child was only three or four years old, but the mother no longer had the strength to carry her.</p><p>Fortunately, the mother wasn't tall, so the child could just about touch the ground, but being so young, she stumbled and staggered as her mother pulled her forward, leaving a trail of broken footprints in the dust.</p><p>The mother's expression, like the others, was vacant. When the sandstorm hit, she merely lowered her head slightly, but her grip on the child's wrist remained firm as iron.</p><p>Startled by the child's cries, the mother's dull eyes shifted slightly, glancing at her child in a daze, instinctively reaching out to wipe the child's eyes with the inside of her sleeve.</p><p>The child's eyes were filled with dust, and the rubbing only exacerbated the pain.</p><p>Blowing on the child's eyes would have been better, but the mother seemed to have forgotten, simply continuing to rub, stubbornly and forcefully.</p><p>The child's cries intensified.</p><p>Someone nearby noticed something was amiss.</p><p>"What's wrong with you!"</p><p>An elderly man patted the woman, kindly intending to help.</p><p>The mother suddenly flew into a frenzy, shoving the old man away, clutching her child tightly, screaming in terror, "My child! Don't take my child…"</p><p>This scene was heartbreaking, but the crowd barely stirred; who had the energy for sympathy now?</p><p>Not far away, a family was also slowly making their way, a thin couple with three children. Each parent led one child by the hand, taking turns carrying a smaller one on their back.</p><p>In the throng of refugees, it was remarkable for a family to remain intact this far, but every person meant another mouth to feed.</p><p>Passing by the mother and child, the man glanced at them.  When he saw the child's skin beneath the tear streaks, a strange image flashed through his mind.</p><p>Yesterday evening, someone had set up a pot by the roadside, the enticing aroma of cooked meat wafting from within.</p><p>But with the severe drought, even the animals here couldn't survive.</p><p>His eyes fixed on the child's face, he seemed to smell that aroma again, his throat bobbing, his pace instinctively slowing, his gaze growing unsettling.</p><p>The child seemed to sense something, clinging tightly to her mother.</p><p>The wife and the other three children remained oblivious to the man's actions, continuing to walk forward.</p><p>The man felt a tug on his arm and turned his head to see his own children, but the unsettling look in his eyes didn't fade.</p><p>His three children's clothes were stuffed with grass and deliberately rolled in the dirt, grimy and indistinguishable by gender.</p><p>In truth, all three were girls.  If they hadn't been traveling with their clan, they would have been targeted long ago.</p><p>Not long ago, they encountered bandits and were separated from their clan. Their supplies were gone, and without the support of their kin, they were starving.  How could he feed these three children?</p><p>They wouldn't survive.</p><p>They couldn't all survive.</p><p>Impossible…</p><p>The man repeated this mantra in his mind, his throat bobbing again.</p><p>He wouldn't dare harm others, nor could he bring himself to harm his own children, yet a frantic thought took root.</p><p>He stood still, his wife and daughters looking at him in confusion.</p><p>A husband and wife share a deep connection. The wife saw something in her husband's eyes, first disbelief, then intense fear.</p><p>'Slap!'</p><p>The wife slapped her husband across the face, screaming, "Are you crazy! They're your own flesh and blood! How could you even think that?!"</p><p>The wife's slap carried little force.</p><p>Yet the man reeled as if struck a heavy blow, falling to the ground.</p><p>"Dad! Dad!"</p><p>His daughters, startled, rushed to help him, forgetting their parents' previous instructions not to speak.</p><p>Fortunately, few people paid attention to their voices, their gaze fixed on the man.</p><p>Seeing him get back on his feet, some faces shifted from anticipation to disappointment.</p><p>The man covered his face, head bowed, not daring to look at his daughters, much less meet his wife's gaze.</p><p>Just then, a 'thud' echoed as another person collapsed by the roadside.</p><p>This time, it was an old man.</p><p>The old man was accompanied by a thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy, presumably his grandson.</p><p>For days, the old man's health had been deteriorating, his steps faltering, a fact noticed by many.</p><p>Today, he finally succumbed!</p><p>"Grandpa! Grandpa!"</p><p>The boy tugged desperately at the old man's arm, trying to pull him up, but the old man's head drooped lower, his eyes closing, his breathing faint.</p><p>Suddenly, the boy saw his grandfather's body shrouded in shadow. Looking up, he realized that a circle of people had gathered around them, their eyes fixed on his grandfather with a wolfish glint.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>The boy cried out in terror, throwing himself over his grandfather, pleading, "No! Don't eat Grandpa! Grandpa's just asleep! Grandpa's not dead! Grandpa's not dead!"</p><p>Amidst the boy's pleas, someone grabbed his shoulders, while others seized his legs, pulling him back with force.</p><p>Seeing the boy clinging desperately to the old man, refusing to let go, others crouched down, gripping his hands, and began to pry his fingers open one by one, starting with the thumbs, the sickening crack of bones echoing in the air.</p><p>At first, only a few people acted.</p><p>The boy's desperate pleas only attracted more.</p><p>Most didn't have the courage, watching from a distance, especially as a sickness had recently spread, and the old man's health had declined after contracting it.</p><p>But there were too many starving people here, driven to desperation.</p><p>…</p><p>"This is chaos," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Compared to this scene, the hardships spoken of by the people on the Fuchun River were nothing.</p><p>He took Xiao Wu's hand and walked down the mountain.</p><p>A pot was quickly set up by the roadside, a fire lit beneath it.</p><p>Some held the boy down, while others, realizing there wasn't enough water, remembered a spring in a nearby gully and gathered water pouches to fetch more.</p><p>Several people clumsily moved the old man to the pot's side, about to strip his clothes.</p><p>As they busied themselves, they suddenly heard a voice, "He's only ill, his body weak, not yet departed.  Might this humble Daoist take a look?"</p><p>Everyone looked up at the newcomer. Three men stood up, blocking the way, glaring fiercely at Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's attire, their bravado immediately diminished.</p><p>Nowadays, only spirits and deities offered hope, and no one dared disrespect a Daoist priest, especially one as composed as Qin Sang.</p><p>The madness in their eyes receded somewhat, and they hesitantly made way.</p><p>Qin Sang approached the old man, placed a hand on his forehead, took out a mung bean-sized, jet-black pill, and placed it in the old man's mouth.</p><p>On the dirt road, everyone stopped, their gazes fixed on the old man.</p><p>"Grandpa!"</p><p>Those holding the boy down released him, and he finally broke free, crying and rushing to his grandfather's side.</p><p>After swallowing the black pill, the old man's eyelids fluttered, his barely perceptible breathing gradually strengthening.</p><p>A faint blush even appeared on his parched, bark-like face.</p><p>It seemed not only had his illness subsided, but his vitality had also been restored.</p><p>Instantly, everyone's eyes widened, and the boy's face lit up with joy, wiping away his tears, carefully helping his grandfather up.</p><p>'Cough! Cough!'</p><p>The old man coughed violently, catching his breath, slowly opening his eyes to see his grandson.</p><p>"Huan Lang…"</p><p>He reached out and touched his grandson's face, opened his mouth to speak, then suddenly felt a change in his body.</p><p>The searing pain in his throat was gone, the gnawing hunger in his belly vanished, the fog in his mind cleared, and he lifted his arm with ease.</p><p>It was as if he'd just eaten a full meal, his body brimming with energy.</p><p>The old man pushed himself up with one hand, standing up abruptly, even hopping twice, feeling no weakness, as if in a dream.</p><p>Witnessing this, everyone stared in disbelief.</p><p>"A divine pill!"</p><p>"A celestial being!"</p><p>"Bow to the celestial being!"</p><p>Everyone went wild, rushing from the dirt road, prostrating themselves before Qin Sang, worshipping him.</p><p>"A celestial being has come to save us!"</p><p>"Celestial being, save us!"</p><p>"Save us!"</p><p>…</p><p>They cried out with all their remaining strength.</p><p>The old man, realizing what had happened, knelt with his grandson, kowtowing repeatedly.</p><p>"Blessings from the celestial being! Blessings from the celestial being!"</p><p>These people were already weak and frail.  Overcome with emotion, several fainted on the spot.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, looking at the surging crowd, and said, "This humble Daoist has more of these pills. There's no need to crowd."</p><p>He glanced at the iron pot beside him, frowned, kicked it over, and pointed at several people in the crowd, "Set up the pots.  Those who have the strength, fetch water and firewood, as much as you can.  Boil the pills, form an orderly line, everyone will have a share."</p><p>The crowd obeyed Qin Sang without question.  A row of stoves was quickly set up, and firewood and water were brought in steadily.</p><p>Qin Sang ruffled Xiao Wu's hair. "Xiao Wu, you tend the fire."</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded and went to start the fire. She didn't use any magical powers, but her movements were efficient and practiced.</p><p>Seeing a young girl managing several stoves, the crowd felt a pang of sympathy, but more importantly, they worried whether she would ruin the divine pills and whether they would get their share of the elixir-infused water.</p><p>But this was the celestial being's command, and no one dared to speak, silently watching Xiao Wu work.</p><p>News spread through the refugee column, and people from both ahead and behind converged, forming a long queue before the stoves, a snaking dragon of humanity.</p><p>The family from earlier reacted quickly, securing a place near the front.</p><p>The wife, watching Xiao Wu moving between the stoves, had a thought, a spark of hope flickering in her eyes.</p><p>She suddenly shoved her three daughters forward, whispering, "Go help the little celestial being."</p><p>Xiao Wu looked up briefly, then back down.</p><p>The three girls approached hesitantly. Seeing Xiao Wu say nothing and Qin Sang not dismissing them, they timidly picked up firewood from the ground and carefully handed it to Xiao Wu.</p><p>Xiao Wu reached out, took the wood, and added it to the fire.</p><p>Emboldened by this gesture, the three girls joined in, helping with the work.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
