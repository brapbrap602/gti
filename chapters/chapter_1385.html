<h1>Chapter 1377: The Sun, Moon, Star, and Hundred Flower Valley</h1><p>Upper Region.</p><p>Qin Sang left a merchant association and headed towards the next one.</p><p>He was not in a hurry to meet Senior Feng. This series of inquiries was mainly to understand the situation of the Three Realms of the North Sea.</p><p>These merchant associations had well-informed channels, and at this time, Qin Sang had a general impression of the Three Realms.</p><p>"Sun, Moon, Star..."</p><p>The sea chart the merchant had shown him earlier flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The three areas controlled by the human race are known as the Sun, Moon, and Star.</p><p>Among them, 'Moon' and 'Sun' refer to two of the Three Realms of the North Sea: Crescent Moon Realm, where Qin Sang was, and another, Hidden Sun Realm.</p><p>'Star' refers to a sea area called the Star Sand Archipelago.</p><p>As the name suggests, this sea area has countless islands, as dense as stardust. Although the territory is also very vast, it is not one of the Three Realms of the North Sea.</p><p>The third realm is a demon realm, commonly known as Demon Island.</p><p>Hidden Sun Realm, Crescent Moon Realm, and Demon Realm constitute the Three Realms of the North Sea, separated by more than tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>The Three Realms roughly occupy the east, west, and north three areas of the North Sea respectively.</p><p>Among them, Hidden Sun Realm is in the east, and Crescent Moon Realm is in the west.</p><p>Crescent Moon Island has a long and winding terrain. The northern Moon Tip is not far from the storm belt, and the southern Moon Tip extends all the way to the southern North Sea.</p><p>Hidden Sun Realm is the smallest of the Three Realms. It is said to be a circular land, very regular.</p><p>Legend has it that the weather there is the coldest, with snow all year round, hence the name Hidden Sun.</p><p>Demon Island is located between Hidden Sun Realm and Crescent Moon Realm, but not in the exact center, but in the northern area.</p><p>In the middle is a vast and boundless sea area, with a simple and crude name: Boundless Sea.</p><p>There are islands and lands here, but they cannot be compared with the Three Realms, and they all border the Three Realms, making the situation chaotic.</p><p>Many devils and bloodthirsty demon kings haunt here. It is a mixed bag and a lawless land, with constant killings.</p><p>The Rifting Isles of Canglang Sea are similar places, but they cannot be compared with the Boundless Sea.</p><p>I don't know if those merchants are exaggerating.</p><p>It is rumored that Nascent Soul cultivators must be cautious when entering the Boundless Sea, and many Nascent Souls have disappeared while traversing the Boundless Sea. Therefore, although Crescent Moon Realm and Hidden Sun Realm are both controlled by the human race, the cultivators here do not know much about Hidden Sun Realm.</p><p>There is only one recognized fact: Hidden Sun Realm is not as divided and disorganized as Crescent Moon Realm.</p><p>The entire Hidden Sun Realm is controlled by a super power called the Profound Heaven Palace .</p><p>According to these people's descriptions, the Profound Heaven Palace should not be a loose organization like the Northern Chen Alliance , but a sect. The Palace Lord  is a Grand Cultivator !</p><p>One can imagine how huge the Profound Heaven Palace is!</p><p>The Demon Realm is naturally the territory of the demon race.</p><p>The human race and demon race in the North Sea, like the human and witch races in the Canglang Sea, have a deep blood feud.</p><p>In Canglang Sea, firstly, the demon race in the Demon Sea can transfer the conflict, and secondly, the witch race is declining and shrinking on the Witch God Continent, so the conflict between the two races has eased a lot.</p><p>The North Sea is different. The two races are sworn enemies and cannot be reconciled.</p><p>It is said that the Demon Realm was originally inhabited by the human race, but they were all slaughtered by the demon race. Now the demon race has dominated the Demon Realm.</p><p>Not only that.</p><p>The Star Sand Archipelago is located northeast of the Moon Tip of the Crescent Moon Realm, and also borders the Demon Realm. It has already been swallowed by the demon race, and the demon race is still pressing closer.</p><p>The dragon ship came to the Crescent Moon Realm from the Star Sand Archipelago.</p><p>The location where Qin Sang left the storm belt is located between the Crescent Moon Realm and the Star Sand Archipelago. If he goes further east, he may directly fall into the sphere of influence of the demon race.</p><p>The various merchant associations know the most about Crescent Moon Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang is most concerned about this place.</p><p>Since he is here, he might as well stay.</p><p>If there are no accidents, he should be traveling in the Crescent Moon Realm for a long time.</p><p>Here, heroes are divided and the situation is even more chaotic than the Northern Chen Realm. Qin Sang must also deal with it carefully.</p><p>Senior Feng is one of the overlords, famous throughout the Crescent Moon Realm.</p><p>Thinking about these things, Qin Sang passed through several streets and came to a tall building.</p><p>"Fengyang Tower ..."</p><p>Seeing these three big characters, Qin Sang knew that he had come to the right place. He paused, and then stepped inside.</p><p>On the first floor, dozens of beautiful female cultivators were receiving guests like butterflies fluttering among flowers, which was very pleasing to the eye.</p><p>However, after Qin Sang walked in, the one who received him was an old steward , who led Qin Sang to a quiet room on the second floor and served him spiritual tea.</p><p>"What does Fellow Daoist Mingyue  need to buy? I will order someone to get it right away, and ensure that Fellow Daoist does not make this trip in vain."</p><p>The old steward said with a smile, personally pouring tea for Qin Sang.</p><p>He was also a Golden Core cultivator, with an attitude that was neither humble nor arrogant, treating Qin Sang as an equal.</p><p>However, the confidence on the old steward's face quickly froze.</p><p>The several spiritual objects that Qin Sang named were all extremely rare, and Fengyang Market  could not produce a single one.</p><p>The old steward's eyes were suspicious, wondering if Qin Sang was deliberately teasing him. A Golden Core cultivator should not be qualified to covet these things.</p><p>"This place is not much better than the Northern Chen Realm or the Canglang Sea!"</p><p>Qin Sang tried it out a little, and he had a clue.</p><p>Sure enough, they are all places of cages, not particularly rich.</p><p>I just don't know if the North Sea cultivation world has such unique inheritance as the witch race, which can open his eyes.</p><p>He didn't care what the old steward thought, lightly turned the teacup with his finger, pondered for a while, and said, "Does your shop sell any secrets related to insect control ?"</p><p>"Insect control?"</p><p>The old steward was stunned, a little surprised.</p><p>Insect control is a branch of beast control , and the most unpopular one. Even sects famous for beast control rarely practice this path.</p><p>"Insect control secrets, or secret techniques for cultivating spiritual insects, are all acceptable."</p><p>Qin Sang paused and added, "If there are top-level sword arts, they can also be brought together, and the price is easy to negotiate."</p><p>Top-level sword arts can be mutually verified with the *Yuanshen Yang Jian Zhang* .</p><p>However, Qin Sang did not have high hopes.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang's tone was very big, the old steward's doubts lessened a bit. After thinking for a while, he said, "I don't know what kind of sword art can be regarded as top-level. The merchant association does have several treasured ones. I will order them all to be brought over for Fellow Daoist to choose. As for the insect control secret, Fellow Daoist Mingyue has come to the right place. The merchant association happens to have one, and it has quite a background!"</p><p>Qin Sang became interested when he heard this, "I would like to hear the details!"</p><p>The old steward stroked his long beard and said with a confident look, "This insect control secret is called *Chong Hua Jing* . It can be determined that it was passed down from the Hundred Flower Valley. Since Fellow Daoist is a master in this way, you can't be unaware of the name of Hundred Flower Valley, right? In the way of insect control, if Hundred Flower Valley ranks second, I am afraid no one dares to call themselves first!"</p><p>Qin Sang really didn't know anything about the Hundred Flower Valley. He could only remain calm, nodded repeatedly, and urged the old steward to fetch it.</p><p>After a joss stick of incense.</p><p>The old steward personally brought several secret books.</p><p>Qin Sang could see the quality of those sword arts just by looking at the first layer. He casually threw them aside and only paid for the *Chong Hua Jing*.</p><p>Finally, he picked up the jade slip that recorded the *Chong Hua Jing*.</p><p>It is a secret technique for cultivating spiritual insects, with some unique features.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is a fragment. It only records ordinary spiritual insects. There are only a few rare insect level records, and there are no related records of Heavenly Eye Butterflies , Fat Silkworms , and Fire Jade Centipedes.</p>
