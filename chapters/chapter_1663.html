<h1>Chapter 1654: The Firefly Chain</h1><p>“The Fire Rhinoceros!”</p><p>Kun Dao also saw the crimson immortal pendant, her breathing becoming heavier.  She had just heard her senior brother mention several top-tier treasures of the Fire Phase lineage, including the Fire Rhinoceros, a treasure most astonishing for its ability to set up a tribulation-crossing formation. After the destruction of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, the Fire Rhinoceros’ whereabouts were unknown.  It turned out to have been brought into the Yan Yan Divine Forbidden Zone by a Fire Phase ancestor.</p><p>Kun Dao was eager to act, but seeing her senior brother remain still, she dared not act rashly.</p><p>“Junior Sister, don't get too excited.  Setting up a tribulation-crossing formation requires not only the Fire Rhinoceros but also a supreme treasure from the Water Phase lineage, a treasure whose location remains unknown. Furthermore, we don't know the formation's method.  Reconstructing it would be incredibly difficult,”</p><p>The man in white robes shook his head slightly, pouring cold water on Kun Dao’s enthusiasm.</p><p>Kun Dao wasn't discouraged.  She turned her head towards the east, “Perhaps the Water Phase lineage's treasure was also brought into the mountains by its ancestor. Senior Brother, after taking the Fire Rhinoceros, shouldn't we go to the Water Divine Forbidden Zone?”</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Forbidden Zones are arranged around the mountain according to the generative cycle of the five elements. Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire; therefore, they are separated from the Water Divine Forbidden Zone by the Wood Divine Forbidden Zone. The best route is to exit the Fire Divine Forbidden Zone and proceed from the outside.</p><p>Wandering around outside risks being discovered.</p><p>But that's not the biggest problem.</p><p>They can move freely within the Yan Yan Divine Forbidden Zone thanks to the Yan Yan Divine Sword, but they don't even know what kind of divine forbidden zone protects the Water Phase area.  If its power is comparable to the Yan Yan Divine Forbidden Zone, it will be difficult for the two of them to find the Water Phase ancestor's dwelling.</p><p>The man in white robes understood. His junior sister certainly knew the difficulties involved, but the temptation of the tribulation-crossing formation was too great.</p><p>“It’s too early to talk about tribulation-crossing,”</p><p>The white-robed man reassured her, then changed his tone, “The tribulation-crossing formation is only one of the Fire Rhinoceros’ uses. Several powerful techniques within the sect can be greatly simplified with the help of the Fire Rhinoceros. Even without the tribulation-crossing formation, this trip won’t be in vain…”</p><p>Upon hearing the names of these techniques, Kun Dao’s eyes lit up.</p><p>While exchanging words, they continued to observe the cave dwelling.  The old man sat silently, truly deceased; he was likely as decayed as the other corpse, only preserved from turning to ash by the fire bell.</p><p>The two hesitated no longer and entered the cave dwelling one after another.</p><p>The man in white robes went straight to the fire bell. Approaching, he didn’t reach out rashly but glanced at the old man's lifeless face before observing the formation beneath him.</p><p>Kun Dao followed closely, continuously examining the cave dwelling. Her gaze swept over the spot where the other corpse had lain; her expression shifted, as if she'd made a new discovery, and she suddenly darted over.</p><p>The corpse was seated at the edge of the fire bell's spirit formation, on a stone platform also enveloped by the formation's energy, though outside the fire bell itself.  Judging by their positions, there was a clear hierarchical distinction between them.</p><p>Only a pile of white ash remained on the stone platform where the corpse had been.</p><p>Kun Dao glanced at it twice, then reached out to grab the ash.</p><p>Her impulsive action startled the man in white robes.  His expression changed, fearing she might trigger the formation. He was about to stop her when the ash swelled, and an object flew out, landing in Kun Dao's hand.</p><p>It was a bracelet. At first glance, it lacked dazzling brilliance, but after brushing away the ash, the exquisite design of the chain became apparent—any female cultivator would find it captivating.</p><p>The most striking features were three dragon-eye-sized red gemstones.</p><p>Each gemstone contained a tiny inner flame, pure fire essence, radiating a faint glow within the crystal.  Though not dazzling, it was exceptionally beautiful.</p><p>“The Firefly Chain!”</p><p>The man in white robes was astonished. This was another precious treasure of the Fire Phase Hall.</p><p>“Senior Brother,” Kun Dao looked up, her face full of joy, playing with the Firefly Chain lovingly.</p><p>“Keep it.  When we return, I will teach you several seals; with the chain, your strength will surely increase significantly!”</p><p>The white-robed man couldn’t very well snatch his junior sister’s treasure. After examining it and confirming it was indeed the treasure described in the texts, he returned it, envying her good fortune.</p><p>Then, he cautioned Kun Dao to refrain from further rash actions!</p><p>He had observed the fire bell's spirit formation and discerned several clues. The cave dwelling channeled celestial fire from the external Yan Yan Divine Forbidden Zone, feeding into the formation, suppressing its violent nature, and forming the fire bell.  It seemed that the Yan Yan Divine Forbidden Zone was the source of the formation’s power, but the Fire Rhinoceros was also indispensable, playing a crucial role.</p><p>Removing the Fire Rhinoceros rashly could, at best, cause the formation to destabilize and the fire bell to collapse, and at worst, trigger a celestial fire eruption; the endless celestial fire outside could easily destroy this sacred place.  In such a scenario, even the Yan Yan Divine Sword couldn't save them.</p><p>Hearing the serious consequences described by her senior brother, Kun Dao was frightened and immediately confessed her fault, hiding behind the man in white robes, avoiding his serious gaze while happily admiring her chain.</p><p>The white-robed man, understanding his junior sister’s nature, smiled helplessly.</p><p>The Jade Terrace Sect was a secluded sect; its disciples rarely ventured out.  The younger sister, a favorite, had barely left the mountain since joining, remaining naive and innocent like a young girl.</p><p>He dismissed distracting thoughts, carefully studying the spirit array, considering how to retrieve the Fire Rhinoceros core and the old man's belongings.</p><p>Kun Dao hid behind him, her eyes glued to the firefly chain.  The more she looked, the more she liked it.  After briefly examining it, she eagerly fastened it to her wrist.</p><p>The firefly chain and her fair wrist complemented each other; even if not a treasure, it was a stunning adornment.</p><p>The moment she put on the chain, Kun Dao paused imperceptibly before resuming her normal actions.  Unaware of her momentary hesitation, she continued to twist her wrist, admiring the chain endlessly, her other hand unconsciously caressing the crystals. The fireflies within gently swayed, as if responding to her touch.</p><p>After a long while,</p><p>the Daoist in white robes finally understood the mechanism.</p><p>“Sister, step back!”</p><p>He gave a low warning.</p><p>Kun Dao obediently retreated three steps.  Her fascination with the firefly chain subsided; she quietly watched her senior brother, her fingers still softly stroking the crystals.</p><p>“Disciple is disrespectful, ancestor, forgive me!”</p><p>The Daoist in white robes bowed to the old man and sat down.</p><p>Then, he raised a hand above his head. A red light shot out from his crown, and his Red Fire Sword rose, plunging into the red light.</p><p>In an instant, the red light faded, and countless intricate runes, forming complex patterns, appeared on the Red Fire Sword's surface.</p><p>The patterns flickered, with a strange power flowing and circulating along the blade.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Red Fire Sword paused briefly before flying towards the fire bell, its tip pointed directly at the Fire Rhinoceros core.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Daoist in white robes began working rapidly, his hands dancing, creating seals in the air and continuously embedding them within the fire bell.</p><p>The spirit sword hummed, its intent, guided by the seals, seeping into the fire bell—essentially using the seals to merge with the spirit array.</p><p>During this process, the Red Fire Sword itself became increasingly ethereal, almost turning into a beam of light, slowly descending to truly touch the fire bell.</p><p>The fire bell trembled slightly, but the expected counterattack didn't come.</p><p>The Daoist in white robes was secretly pleased, knowing he had done it correctly, and immediately sped up.</p><p>The sword light, now transformed into a small sword shadow, gradually merged into the fire bell until it vanished. Inside the fire bell, a finger-sized sword shadow slowly moved, approaching the Fire Rhinoceros core.</p><p>Then, the light within the sword shadow converged, and a faint magical seal became visible.</p><p>This seal was meant to replace the Fire Rhinoceros core. The core wasn't the source of the fire bell's spirit array's power; using the seal as a substitute would lose the true yang demon-refining effect, but it would allow the array to maintain itself for a short period.</p><p>This way, he could easily take the treasure.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The sword shadow attempted to pry the Fire Rhinoceros core loose, like disturbing a hornet's nest. The fire bell violently shook, its energy wildly fluctuating.</p><p>This was expected by the Daoist in white robes.</p><p>However, he felt a sudden tightening in his chest.  The old man inside the bell was also shaken, his body swaying, features shifting, as if about to awaken—a rather eerie scene.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the Daoist in white robes relaxed.  The old man, like the previous corpse, turned to dust.  Years of exposure to the blazing sun's fire meant even a Nascent Soul's remains couldn't survive.</p><p>Besides, it wasn't certain if the old man was a Nascent Soul cultivator before his death.</p><p>The old man was dead.</p><p>As the body turned to dust, an object, a corner of what looked like a finger ring, was revealed.</p><p>There seemed to be no other belongings.</p><p>“A spatial storage treasure?”</p><p>The thought flashed through the Daoist's mind, his heart aflame with desire.</p><p>Both corpses in the cave were completely decayed; he no longer needed to worry.  His gaze returned to the Fire Rhinoceros core, manipulating the Red Fire Sword to continue prying, causing the cave to tremble violently.</p><p>After countless attempts, the Daoist in white robes finally fully understood the mechanism.  Without hesitation, he quickly completed a hand seal and shouted, “Fall!”</p><p>The sword shadow ceased its struggle with the Fire Rhinoceros core and suddenly dropped, aiming to pierce the fire bell and take the finger ring first.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The Red Fire Sword pierced the fire bell, scattering ashes, and lifting the single finger ring. It turned to return, but the array suddenly changed.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The fire bell shook violently, a bell-like sound seeming to emanate from the Daoist's heart, causing his eyes to swim.</p><p>Flames erupted from the bell, and several fire dragons lunged toward the Red Fire Sword.</p><p>“This array allows entry but not exit?”</p><p>The Daoist's thoughts raced.  He quickly changed his seal, and the Red Fire Sword flickered several times, dodging the fire dragons, and continued its upward rush.</p><p>The scene within the spirit array erupted into chaos. A sword’s shadow darted and weaved, a breathtaking display of danger.</p><p>The Daoist in white robes, his mind taut, focused intently on the Crimson Fire Sword, seemingly merging with the spirit weapon as he desperately searched for a way out.  The only good news was that the fire spirit array was targeting the Crimson Fire Sword, showing no signs of attacking them yet.</p><p>“Junior Sister, help me!”</p><p>The battle reached a fever pitch.  The Daoist in white robes finally devised a plan, but he feared it was beyond his capabilities alone. He urgently called for his junior sister’s assistance.</p><p>Obediently, the junior sister stepped forward. As instructed, she summoned a phoenix hairpin.  Its image flashed, like a sharp blade, piercing the fire bell—perfect timing.</p><p>Inside and out, a chance appeared.</p><p>Like a fish leaping through a dragon gate, the Crimson Fire Sword seized the fleeting opportunity and escaped!</p><p>Simultaneously, talismans manifested, aiming to retrieve the fire rhinoceros along with the sword—a daring attempt to secure both treasures at once.</p><p>A tense moment, heart-stopping.</p><p>The situation seemed settled.  The Daoist in white robes was about to laugh in triumph when a sudden premonition struck him. He felt a sharp gust of wind aimed at his side, heading straight for his vital point.  Terror seized him.</p><p>“Junior Sister, you…”</p><p>The Daoist in white robes spun around in shock.  He saw his junior sister staring at him, her movements stiff, her expression vacant, her eyes empty.</p><p>Her usually charming face now filled him with icy dread.</p><p>“Demonic corruption?”</p><p>The words flashed through the Daoist’s mind, but something felt wrong.</p><p>Their sect’s scriptures clearly stated that demonic corruption didn't strike immediately; the stronger the cultivator, the greater their resistance. Otherwise, the cultivation world would have been overturned long ago.</p><p>His junior sister, a Yuan Ying cultivator, couldn't possibly have been silently controlled by demonic corruption.  Besides, the bodies in the cave had long turned to ash. What was sustaining the corruption?</p><p>His junior sister's symptoms were also wrong.  Demonic corruption transformed cultivators into terrifying demonic creatures—not like this.</p><p>This scripture was hand-written by their ancestor, a survivor of a demonic tribulation. It couldn't be wrong.</p><p>A flurry of questions raced through his mind, but answers would remain elusive.</p><p>The surprise attack landed.  His protective qi instantly activated. Simultaneously, his robe fluttered, releasing a green ring, a rare artifact that automatically provided protection.</p><p>But just as the ring appeared, it was engulfed by a blinding celestial fire.</p><p>“Celestial fire…”</p><p>The Daoist in white robes could only groan inwardly. The fire bell array had been focused on the Crimson Fire Sword.  Why, at this critical moment, was it targeting him?</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>As the crisis deepened, a realization dawned on the Daoist. The fire bell array hadn't been unable to target him earlier; an unseen hand was manipulating the celestial fire, deceiving him.</p><p>It must also be controlling his junior sister!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The celestial fire tore through his robe's defenses.  The searing pain jolted the Daoist back to reality.</p><p>The change was sudden. The junior sister and the celestial fire's coordination was impeccable. The Daoist had no time to react.  He lowered his head, seeing his junior sister's delicate hand plunged a jade sword into his chest, blood gushing forth.</p><p>“I taught her swordsmanship…”</p><p>Memories flooded back.</p><p>The Daoist in white robes gave a bitter laugh, his eyes quickly losing their light.</p><p>The next moment, a brilliant light shot from the top of his head—his Yuan Ying spirit body escaping.  Bewildered, he looked around, his pained gaze sweeping over his junior sister, then turned to instantly teleport out.</p><p>Celestial fire raged everywhere outside. He didn't know if he could escape, but it was his only chance.</p><p>But the celestial fire's advance didn't stop. Flames suddenly burst outwards, sealing the entire cave, easily confining the Daoist's Yuan Ying in place.</p><p>Then, the junior sister’s eyelids fluttered, as if regaining some awareness.  She smelled the pungent blood, opened her eyes, and saw her senior brother dead at her hands, his unseeing eyes staring at her.</p><p>The shock was overwhelming, instantly stunning her.</p><p>A piercing scream echoed through the cave, shrill and agonizing.</p><p>Soon, the scream faded, replaced by sucking sounds.</p><p>Before the junior sister could escape, she lost herself again, lunging at her senior brother’s corpse like a ravenous beast, greedily devouring his life essence.  The scene was truly demonic.</p><p>Blood flowed from her mouth, staining her clothes, but she paid no attention. After draining his essence, she fixed her gaze on his Yuan Ying spirit body, grabbing it and shoving it into her mouth, chewing greedily.</p><p>The grinding of teeth, coupled with occasional, shrill screams, was horrifying.</p><p>Gradually, the screams lessened, and the cave fell silent, leaving only a mutilated corpse and a blood-soaked cultivator, slumped on the ground.</p>
