<h1>Chapter 1122: Pill Completion (Extra Chapter for盟主是夏天呀!)</h1><p>An indeterminate amount of time passed.</p><p>The cave dwelling suddenly opened.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, and he quickly approached.</p><p>He saw Li Yu Fu with bloodshot eyes and a vacant expression, emerging from the cave, holding three items in his hands.</p><p>A jade slip.</p><p>A jade bottle containing a spirit pill the size of a dragon's eye.</p><p>The pill was pure white, as clean as a Nine Illusion Sky Orchid.</p><p>A wisp of spiritual mist constantly surrounded the pill.</p><p>It was the Du E Pill!</p><p>There was also a section of charred wood, as thick as a finger, completely blackened.</p><p>"Senior Uncle."</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, Li Yu Fu's eyes regained a glimmer of life, and he said woodenly, "These were all left for you by Grandmaster."</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, and said with difficulty, "Your Grandmaster...he..."</p><p>Li Yu Fu nodded, his tiger eyes filled with tears, his voice filled with extreme sorrow, "Grandmaster failed his tribulation.  As his Nascent Soul was about to dissipate, he used Emperor Flowing Liquid to sustain himself, refined the Du E Pill, and then...and then..."</p><p>Although he was introduced to the immortal sect by Qin Sang, from the Qi Condensation stage to the Core Formation stage, even his alchemy skills, were all thanks to Yun You Zi's unreserved guidance.  He was where he was today because of him.</p><p>Yun You Zi was his closest kin.</p><p>Now, with his closest kin perished, separated by life and death, how could he not grieve?</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang closed his eyes and sighed to the heavens.</p><p>No wonder he sensed something strange about Yun You Zi's aura.</p><p>Having failed his tribulation, Yun You Zi should have perished, yet he consumed Emperor Flowing Liquid, somehow prolonging his life to refine the Du E Pill for him.</p><p>"What merit do I have..."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were vacant, and he murmured to himself.</p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang finally came to his senses.</p><p>He received the three items from Li Yu Fu, knowing that the jade slip must contain Yun You Zi's last words.  He immediately activated his divine sense and probed the jade slip.</p><p>This jade slip was different from others; it wasn't simply used for recording.</p><p>Entering his divine sense into the jade slip was like entering an unknown space.</p><p>Within the space, there was a figure, its back to him.</p><p>Dressed in Taoist robes, with white hair and beard, an immortal bearing, it was Yun You Zi.</p><p>"Senior?"</p><p>Qin Sang tentatively called out.</p><p>Yun You Zi turned around, his figure slightly illusory.</p><p>"Qin Lao Di!"</p><p>A smile appeared on Yun You Zi's lips, but a hint of loneliness flashed in his eyes as he sighed, "To see you here...it seems my main body failed the tribulation."</p><p>"You are a thought, preserved by a prohibition, Senior?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked in surprise.</p><p>Yun You Zi nodded. "Junior Brother, you must have many questions.  That is why I exist, and once I have answered them, I shall dissipate. Allow me to clarify everything for you, and there is one more matter...I need to entrust you with one last task."</p><p>"Senior, please speak. I will do my utmost!"</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly.</p><p>Yun You Zi failed his tribulation, yet he still fulfilled his promise to refine the Du E Pill for him.  For such a great kindness, Qin Sang felt he could never repay him.</p><p>Since Yun You Zi had something to entrust him with, how could he refuse?</p><p>"I know you are righteous, Lao Di, a man of your word. During the years you were missing, I did find several people to entrust with this matter, but none were suitable. To see you safe and sound, I am overjoyed..."</p><p>Yun You Zi said with a satisfied expression.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but ask, "Senior, did you foresee this tribulation?"</p><p>"Do you remember what I told you? I have two great tribulations in my life.  Because of my disharmonious soul, with your help I obtained the Three Lights Jade Liquid and the Green Copper Piece, and I plunged into the demon fire – that was the first tribulation. The second tribulation is this Nascent Soul tribulation..."</p><p>Yun You Zi paused, sighing, "The cause is related to my origins."</p><p>"Origins?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  Remembering the Emperor Flowing Liquid, he quickly focused his attention.</p><p>"I was originally a spiritual bamboo from the Xuan Pu Palace, a Hanging Garden Palace, that gained sentience.  Upon emerging into the world, I encountered cultivators and great demons hunting me, and I barely escaped. Afterward, I hid my true origins and cultivated in the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea in the Demon Realm..."</p><p>Yun You Zi spoke slowly, recounting his past experiences.</p><p>Xuan Pu Palace, spiritual bamboo, Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea...</p><p>A flash of lightning passed through Qin Sang's mind, and he suddenly recalled something, his heart filled with shock: "Senior, you are not..."</p><p>"That's right.  The Lesser Cold Region has seen three appearances of the Ten Great Divine Trees, and one of them was the Clear Fortune Righteous Bamboo.  The Clear Fortune Righteous Bamboo gained sentience, and after its birth, it escaped from under the noses of those Nascent Soul cultivators and great demons – that was me!"</p><p>A hint of pride flashed in Yun You Zi's eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely stunned.</p><p>The true form of Yunyouzi was actually Qingfu Zhengzhu, a sacred bamboo!</p><p>He considered countless possibilities, but never in his wildest dreams did he imagine that Yunyouzi was a spiritual bamboo that had attained enlightenment, and one of the ten great sacred trees—Qingfu Zhengzhu!</p><p>“But senior, you clearly have a human form?” Qin Sang was utterly confused.</p><p>He had been in contact with Yunyouzi for so long, from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to Wuya Valley, and then to Ziwei Palace, experiencing numerous perilous situations.  If Yunyouzi were a spirit being, it would have been impossible to hide it so perfectly, without any trace.</p><p>Yunyouzi's smile faded, and he sighed softly, “I was originally a spiritual bamboo, but through a fortunate turn of events, I transformed into a human.”</p><p>“Years ago, I was severely injured and sought refuge near the Da Sui region to recover. To make matters worse, before my wounds healed, a Heavenly Tribulation descended, forcing me to find a desolate mountain to endure it.</p><p>“During the tribulation, Yunyouzi was traveling through the area, collecting herbs in the mountains.  Witnessing the extraordinary celestial phenomenon, he believed it to be an immortal descending, and climbed mountains and crossed valleys to seek enlightenment. He collapsed from the shockwave of the tribulation before he even got close.</p><p>“As his soul departed, my tribulation also failed, my original form destroyed by the heavenly thunder, and I was about to dissipate.</p><p>“In the midst of unconsciousness, a remnant of my soul unexpectedly entered his body.</p><p>“Whether it was the residual power of the heavenly thunder causing chaos in the heavens, or some other reason, our two fragmented souls miraculously merged, granting us rebirth.</p><p>“However, all my divine powers and treasures were destroyed, and I was left without any spiritual energy, becoming a seventy-year-old mortal, with lingering damage to my soul.</p><p>“From then until now, I cannot even tell if I am Qingfu Zhengzhu or Yunyouzi.</p><p>“Perhaps due to my cultivation in my previous life, my consciousness is predominantly that of the spiritual bamboo.</p><p>“Since I have a human form, I call myself Yunyouzi.  My connection with you, my friend, must be fate.</p><p>“At that time, I was frail and aging, and the remaining soul of the bamboo offered no assistance. I had only a few years to live.  But I did not want to simply fade into obscurity. Fortunately, my memories remained, and I had once done a favor for Piaoya of the Taiyi Danzong. The Taiyi Danzong excels in alchemy, which was perfect for me; perhaps there was a chance to return to the immortal path.</p><p>“So, under the identity of Yunyouzi, I joined the Taiyi Danzong and became Piaoya's alchemy apprentice…</p><p>“During my cultivation, I gradually realized that the forced fusion of our two souls had left a gap, a divergence between us, hindering my progress.  I began searching for a solution.”</p><p>Yunyouzi slowly revealed this secret.</p><p>He paused slightly, “The solution to this problem lies in two things: one, certain heavenly treasures, and two, the inspiration I received from you, my friend.”</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I felt that ending the last chapter there would have resulted in a torrent of angry messages.</p><p>I remember I still owe you all a chapter.  My apologies for the delay; I've been working overtime to finish it.</p><p>I'm so sleepy.</p><p>Time for breakfast.</p><p>Please vote!</p>
