<h1>Chapter 445: The Le Sisters</h1><p>What excited Qin Sang the most was fighting human cultivators, which allowed him to comprehend the Killing Talismans far faster than before. Especially during those few large-scale battles involving thousands of people, being in the terrifying battlefield, facing the omnipresent slaughter, and the ever-present threat of death... His combat experience and comprehension of the way of killing increased at an astonishing rate. This was also one of the reasons why Qin Sang spared no effort in his cultivation; the Killing Talismans were no longer a shackle.</p><p>"A blessing in disguise, I suppose," Qin Sang said self-deprecatingly.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the cave, there was only a single meditation mat. Qin Sang sat cross-legged on it, and after his Qi had fully recovered, he opened his eyes and retrieved his storage pouch and corpse puppet bag.  Various spiritual materials and magical tools flew out of the storage pouch.</p><p>Most of them were magical tools, the majority damaged, with only a few intact, but all of decent quality.</p><p>Qin Sang set up an Earthfire and picked out the easily repairable tools, restoring them to their original state, lest he be cheated by unscrupulous merchants. He abandoned the severely damaged ones, as repairing them would be too time-consuming.</p><p>After repairing the tools, Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the three corpses on the ground.</p><p>He naturally wouldn't have only fought in that one battle during his time outside.</p><p>During this patrol, Qin Sang had experienced several skirmishes, but only killed three Heavenly Alliance cultivators, thanks to the Ebony Sword.</p><p>In the beginning, both sides suffered heavy casualties, but as the cultivators on both sides went through countless battles, they had become very cautious, with rich combat experience and tight formations, making it increasingly difficult to gain an advantage.</p><p>Capturing them alive was even more impossible.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang often acted alone, but now he dared not.</p><p>Not everyone was as wealthy as Qin Sang, with ample Spirit Stones. Many less powerful cultivators lived a miserable existence, relying on meager spiritual energy for cultivation, living a precarious life.</p><p>They had been enduring, hoping that the war would end one day.</p><p>Qin Sang's reliance was merely on the abundant accumulation of the past two years.</p><p>A while ago, he had found an opportunity to return to his sect, and the Earthly Yin Magnetic Flask was more than sufficient with Earthly煞 Qi.</p><p>Qin Sang refined all three corpses into 煞 Corpses. After inspecting his cultivation level through introspection, he stood up, retrieved the Spirit Stones that had been depleted by a small amount, and walked out of the cave.</p><p>The rain poured down.</p><p>The cold wind bit.</p><p>Visibility was poor, but many streaks of light could be seen flying and crisscrossing in the air.</p><p>Qin Sang tightened the magical robe around him, channeled his spiritual power for protection, and then also summoned a streak of light, soaring into the sky and flying towards the northeast.</p><p>For this patrol, he had returned early due to some business, while the rest of his team, led by Mu Yifeng, would continue to complete the mission before returning.</p><p>He flew over more than a hundred islands.</p><p>Qin Sang's face wore a contemplative expression. Suddenly, he sensed something and looked up ahead.</p><p>Three streaks of light were flying towards him.</p><p>The heavy rain obscured his vision, and Qin Sang didn't use his divine sense to check their identities. Within the True Water Mirage Formation, even the most unruly demons wouldn't dare to act recklessly.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The streaks of light crossed paths, and suddenly a surprised voice rang out.</p><p>All four streaks of light stopped simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and looked at the three people opposite him: two men and a woman.</p><p>The two men were of similar age, wearing similar green robes. One had a refined appearance and held a folding fan, while the other had a stern expression and wore a sword.</p><p>The woman was a beautiful middle-aged woman in her forties, not exceptionally beautiful, but with a certain charm.</p><p>She stood close to the man with the sword, their relationship intimate.</p><p>"Rou'er, do you know this fellow Daoist?" the swordsman asked, finding it strange that the woman was looking at Qin Sang with a surprised expression.</p><p>The woman hummed in agreement, hesitated for a moment, and was about to speak.</p><p>Hearing the swordsman's address for her, Qin Sang took the initiative to ask, "Are you Le Rou?"</p><p>This woman was unexpectedly the younger sister, Le Rou, of the Le sisters who had sold him the Spirit Spring items.</p><p>Recalling it, it had already been sixty or seventy years.</p><p>He had helped the Le sisters open the restriction on their cave, and they had not met since.</p><p>Back then, the Le sisters were both at the Qi Refining stage, but now Le Rou was already a mid-Foundation Establishment expert.</p><p>The traces of time on Le Rou's face were faint, and Qin Sang had immediately felt a sense of familiarity, but couldn't be sure if it was the older or younger sister.</p><p>"Senior Qin, it really is you! I'm Le Rou!"</p><p>Not only was Le Rou's cultivation profound, but her temperament was also more composed than Qin Sang remembered, yet she still retained traces of her past self, her face full of pleasant surprise.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Le is already a mid-Foundation Establishment expert. We should address each other as fellow Daoists."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head with a smile. "Back then, I took your tree roots and promised to open your cave. It was only right. There's no need for thanks.  Who are these two fellow Daoists?"</p><p>"He is my husband, surnamed Luo."</p><p>Le Rou pointed to the swordsman and looked up, asking, "I often talk about Senior Qin to you, do you remember?"</p><p>The swordsman's cultivation level was similar to Le Rou's.  He nodded repeatedly and also cupped his hands towards Qin Sang in gratitude.</p><p>"This is Fellow Daoist Du, a friend of ours."</p><p>After they exchanged greetings, Qin Sang asked, "Is your sister, Le Xing, also here?"</p><p>Le Rou still addressed Qin Sang as Senior. "My sister was unable to break through to Foundation Establishment and has already started a family. I settled her family on an island at the edge of the Cloudmire Great Marsh. My sister already has four generations living together, safe and prosperous…  It was thanks to Senior Qin helping us open the cave back then that I am where I am today. I’ve always wanted to thank you.  But Senior vanished without a trace, and even Granny Jing couldn’t find you…"</p><p>Qin Sang gave a soft "Oh" and briefly explained his experiences in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. "I didn't expect to be gone for decades.  When I returned to the cave, I saw Granny Jing’s message talisman.  When I went to apologize to her, she was already gone."</p><p>Le Rou nodded repeatedly. "After we helped Granny Jing with something at her invitation, she told us she had to leave temporarily.  I didn't expect it to be for so long.  I was just summoned here and passed by Ask Moon Market. I went to Granny Jing’s shop and it was still closed. I wonder where she is…"</p><p>Le Rou's face showed concern; she clearly had a close relationship with Granny Jing.</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously, "Fellow Daoist Le was also invited by Granny Jing?  I saw the message talisman after I returned, but it was too late. I wonder what kind of help Granny Jing needed, and whether it was successfully completed?"</p><p>Le Rou apologized, "Please forgive me, Senior.  I swore an oath to Granny Jing and cannot reveal anything to outsiders."</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his understanding. He wasn't that curious; it was just a casual question.</p><p>After some pleasantries, Qin Sang told them the location of his cave and declined the couple's invitation to a banquet, then flew off.</p><p>Fellow Daoist Du watched Qin Sang's streak of light disappear from sight, his expression somewhat strange.</p><p>Le Rou looked over in surprise. "What are you looking at, Fellow Daoist Du?"</p><p>Fellow Daoist Du seemed to awaken from a dream, his face full of envy.  "I didn't expect you to know the infamous Shadowless Sword of Shaohua Mountain!  He's a fierce one, having single-handedly slain a False Core Realm expert!"</p>
