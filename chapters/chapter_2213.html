<h1>Chapter 2203: Terror</h1><p>The lingering miasma slowly began to coalesce, though the poisonous river it had severed showed signs of closing. </p><p>Suddenly, a figure burst through the miasma, shooting out—Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back; the chaos on the battlefield continued, the aftershocks of the dragonfish's self-destruction not yet dissipated.</p><p>This battle, he had fought with his life on the line.  Though he successfully killed the Immortal Child, it came at the cost of severe injuries. Most visibly, his Mingshan armor, while not completely destroyed, was heavily cracked and damaged, requiring a complete reforging.</p><p>The Thunder Beast Guard was also severely injured by the dragonfish's explosion, but its core—the ball of thunder within—remained intact. Its incredible regenerative abilities, coupled with its lack of pain, meant its fighting capabilities remained.</p><p>The Immortal Child's resources were indeed profound.  Despite Qin Sang's thorough preparations, he had nearly suffered a fatal mishap. He couldn't help but feel grateful for his foresight years ago, utilizing the Thunder Altar and the Oath of Thunder Seal for a decisive strike, leaving the Grand Attendant no chance to react.  Otherwise, the outcome would have been uncertain.</p><p>Having slain two powerful foes and successfully resolved the crisis, Qin Sang felt no relief.</p><p>Since he sent the message, Liuli hadn't responded. He was worried about her situation.</p><p>Qin Sang's intention to capture the Immortal Child alive was a precaution; if Liuli were in trouble, he could use him as a bargaining chip. Now that the Immortal Child was dead, he only had the transparent centipede left behind by the man in green robes, along with their belongings.</p><p>The situation was urgent. Qin Sang quickly swallowed several spirit pills to suppress his injuries and swiftly retraced his steps.</p><p>During his flight, Qin Sang took out the transparent centipede and used his spiritual sense to investigate.</p><p>He initially thought it was a clone of the man in green robes, but he found it to be far more complex.</p><p>The centipede contained a sealed, sleeping consciousness—a fragment of the man in green robes' mind, containing only memories from before he entered the Small Heaven.</p><p>It was like a seed. If the original died, the seed would awaken, sprout, and grow into a new man in green robes. Of course, the previously collected spirit insects could not be reborn; he would have to gather them anew.  There must be other limitations to this technique, otherwise, the man in green robes would have kept the centipede within his secluded abode.</p><p>He may not have been particularly cautious; leaving it outside was likely an unconscious act.</p><p>If Qin Sang's assessment was correct, the centipede would be unaware of events within the Small Heaven.  But things could easily go awry, and if forced to exchange hostages, he couldn't simply hand it over.</p><p>Considering the worst-case scenario, Qin Sang pondered his next move. After long contemplation, he lightly flicked his fingers, embedding several restrictions into the centipede.</p><p>He needed to leave a hidden mark on the man's consciousness without him noticing—an extremely difficult task. After many failed attempts, his expression grew increasingly serious.</p><p>Simultaneously, he continuously activated his secret technique, trying to contact Liuli.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang paused slightly. The secret technique finally reacted, detecting a faint response from Liuli!</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang 'heard' the message, his heart filled with joy. He breathed a sigh of relief. Liuli had escaped, shaken off her pursuers, and was now hiding somewhere in Panlong Cave.</p><p>He immediately put away the centipede and flew towards the location Liuli indicated.</p><p>At that moment, three figures were heading deep into Panlong Cave: the black-robed cultivator and the two female cultivators, Ping Xianzi and Xiao Yan.</p><p>"It's a shame we couldn't capture that female cultivator…"</p><p>The black-robed cultivator removed his hood, revealing a pale, thin young man. His eyes scanned his surroundings, searching for any markings left by his companions, drawing ever closer to the battlefield.</p><p>Ping Xianzi looked at Xiao Yan and sighed bitterly, "We didn't expect her to be so bold. Seeing us, instead of retreating, she warned us and we were actually taken aback..."</p><p>It turned out that the two women were previously blocked by an ice wall.  Out of various considerations, Ping Xianzi hesitated and didn't immediately break through.</p><p>She knew the Immortal Child and his allies had gathered for an ambush. Seeing so many top experts seemingly losing ground, yet their enemy still had the strength to issue a warning, suggested their opponent was stronger and more numerous. This made her apprehensive.</p><p>Moreover, she didn't have a close relationship with the Immortal Child's group. She feigned retreat, intending to wait for contact with the Immortal Child and assess the situation.</p><p>The robed cultivator, trapped on the icy plains, was unaware of the approaching reinforcements, giving Liuli the opportunity to deceive and escape.  By the time Lady Ping noticed something was amiss and returned, Liuli, following Qin Sang's instructions, had already withdrawn from the plains before the talisman's power faded, using the cave's terrain to escape.  When Lady Ping arrived, the robed cultivator had just broken through the icy storm and, upon seeing them, realized they had been tricked.</p><p>"I was too cautious!" the robed cultivator regretted.</p><p>Speaking of the previous battle, he frowned deeply, his expression clouded with worry.</p><p>Lady Ping and her companion hadn't yet made a pact with the Immortal Child, so they weren't involved and weren't to blame.</p><p>Looking back, he hadn't fought with full force, wary of Liuli's background. The power displayed by the Emperor's Talisman was astonishing, making him hesitant to act within the icy storm.</p><p>This ensured his safety, but it also cost him a crucial opportunity.</p><p>Noticing the cultivator's worry, Lady Ping asked, "Brother Qi, are you concerned about Daoist Si and the others?"</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>The robed cultivator nodded, frank and direct.  "The talisman on that cultivator couldn't last forever, but we underestimated her, and perhaps we also underestimated Master Qin!"</p><p>Pausing, the robed cultivator said gravely, "They could have easily escaped into the ice plains together, using the terrain and the talisman to force us back. Why risk splitting up?"</p><p>"Brother Qi means the cultivator deliberately lured you away, and Master Qin had a larger scheme?"</p><p>Lady Ping looked astonished and incredulous.  "Brother Qi is overthinking. Master Qin's cultivation is only at the mid-Nascent Soul stage. Unless there were hidden accomplices, even if Master Qin had a plan, it wouldn't matter against overwhelming strength! Daoist Si and Daoist Tang were together."</p><p>"We encountered them unexpectedly; they wouldn't have ambushed us…"</p><p>Doubt flickered in the robed cultivator's eyes. "Master Qin's strength cannot be measured by cultivation level. I hope I'm wrong!"</p><p>"That Master Qin is amazing," Xiao Yan suddenly interjected, leaving Lady Ping and the robed cultivator speechless.</p><p>To avoid losing track of their targets, the Immortal Child and the man in green robes would leave hidden marks using secret techniques.  Due to the chaos in the Dragon Coil Cave, the lingering aura quickly dissipated; the marks lasted a little longer but some were scattered.</p><p>The guidance was intermittent, but they didn't stray from the path. Following it, they reached the ancient restricted area where Qin Sang had killed the man in green.</p><p>Unaware of the previous incident, they passed through the restricted area and flew onward.  The robed cultivator suddenly stopped. "Why is there only Daoist Si's mark here?"</p><p>Lady Ping also noticed something was wrong. Since leaving that ancient restricted area, the other mark had stopped, leaving only the Immortal Child's.</p><p>However, they hadn't noticed anything unusual along the way.</p><p>"Perhaps Daoist Tang was delayed, unable to leave a mark. Since Daoist Si was still able to leave one, they should be alright," Lady Ping consoled.</p><p>The robed cultivator nodded and pressed on, finally reaching the Turbid River and seeing the blood-red water.</p><p>Sensing the bloody aura emanating from the river, the robed cultivator's face paled, and he exclaimed, "This is… the blood of the dragonfish!"</p><p>Xiao Yan felt uneasy and hid behind Lady Ping.</p><p>"Is it one of Daoist Si's companion beasts?"</p><p>Lady Ping's expression was equally grave.</p><p>She didn't know what companion beasts the Immortal Child had, but the bloody aura likely came from one of them, and the circumstances were highly unusual!</p><p>The robed cultivator had seen the Immortal Child's four companion beasts, knowing the dragonfish was the strongest.  A shiver ran down his spine, and his black wings fluttered, transforming into a black phoenix.</p><p>None dared to enter the river. Lady Ping conjured a paper person and threw it into the river's heart.</p><p>The black phoenix and the paper person plunged into the depths. Gradually, their expressions grew heavier.</p><p>They then ordered the black phoenix and the paper person to search upstream and downstream.</p><p>Nothing!</p><p>The phoenix and paper person emerged again, flying to the opposite bank.</p><p>Still nothing!</p><p>They searched everywhere, yet found no marks or auras, as if all traces had vanished here, and the Immortal Child and the man in green had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Two exchanged a look, seeing shock and horror in each other's eyes. Though reluctant to believe it, the lingering blood smell strongly suggested the self-destruction of a dragonfish.</p><p>What exactly happened to the Immortal Child, forcing them to self-destruct their dragonfish?</p><p>Compared to other areas, the vicinity of the Poison River was considered quite stable. This battle happened recently, and the surrounding environment shouldn't have undergone drastic changes. The river's toxicity shouldn't have been enough to drive the Immortal Child to such desperate measures.</p><p>Furthermore, Daoist Tang? Why is there only the scent of dragonfish here?</p><p>Wait!</p><p>They suddenly realized that the traces of the man in green had vanished from that ancient ruin.</p><p>The great river rushed, churning with muddy waves.</p><p>Gazing at the Poison River, the three felt a chill run down their spines, a feeling reminiscent of the ice plains.</p><p>"Let's go back!"</p><p>They promptly retreated to the ancient ruin, searching meticulously but finding nothing. The man in green was killed in the small secluded realm; the outside world wasn't affected. With their cultivation levels, they wouldn't have sensed anything even if they were nearby.</p><p>This outcome was even more terrifying.</p><p>Were they still alive? Where did Daoist Tang go, and why leave no mark? If Daoist Tang had perished here first, why didn't Daoist Si escape but instead continued the pursuit? There were no clues in the markings.</p><p>Despite their intelligence, they couldn't imagine what happened, only deepening their fear. Qin Sang's image became incredibly mysterious, a persistent shadow.</p><p>"Sister Ping," Xiao Yan timidly said, "Let's get out of here."</p><p>"Right, we can't stay here!"</p><p>Fairy Ping decisively declared.</p><p>No matter the speculation, it was all too terrifying. This place was clearly a den of vipers, and the three of them weren't much stronger than the Immortal Child and the other. If their enemy returned, the outcome was unpredictable!</p><p>The black-robed cultivator still couldn't believe that the Immortal Child and the man in green had been killed by Qin Sang, but facts spoke louder than words. Both had vanished without a trace.</p><p>They hurried back, not daring to pause, hearts filled with apprehension. Only upon seeing the cave entrance did they feel a sense of relief, their souls finally settling.</p><p>After flying out, all three remained silent, not immediately leaving. Instead, they found a hidden spot near the Panlong Cave, concealing their true forms. Then, they summoned their black phoenix and paper effigies to investigate.</p><p>Carefully, they guided the phoenix and the effigy back to the Poison River, searching outward from there. Finding nothing, they expanded their search, venturing deep into the Panlong Cave, still finding nothing.</p><p>Not even a trace of Qin Sang, nor of Liuli, was found.</p><p>Fear gnawed at Fairy Ping and the others. They couldn't fathom how Qin Sang had done it, suspecting the Panlong Cave concealed a great terror. This thought urged them to leave as quickly as possible.</p><p>And they still had the Patriarch's mission, which couldn't be delayed.</p><p>It was time to leave.  The three flew from their hiding place, their hearts heavy.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang wound through the cave, finally finding Liuli.</p><p>Liuli was hidden in a small cavern, its entrance guarded by a dilapidated ancient formation that isolated their presence, shielding against external attacks, and maintaining inner tranquility.</p><p>Liuli was meditating when she awoke, vigilantly observing the outside.</p><p>Moments later, a figure passed through the formation, appearing at the entrance. Seeing it was Qin Sang, Liuli's expression softened.</p><p>"You're hurt?"</p><p>"You're hurt?"</p><p>Both spoke simultaneously, then exchanged a smile, the gloom lifting from their hearts.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the cavern, sat before Liuli, and surveyed the surroundings.  "This is a good place. The formation can still hold. Let's not rush out; we'll heal here first."</p><p>Liuli kept studying Qin Sang, finally asking, "You really killed them all?"</p><p>She had overestimated Qin Sang's strength, believing killing the Immortal Child was already impressive. She couldn’t describe her astonishment upon learning of the man in green's death.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, producing the dead men's belongings and the transparent centipede. "This one hasn't truly perished yet. We should be able to learn something from him."</p><p>Liuli nodded. The presence of the Immortal Child and the others was unusual. Something had happened that could affect their plan.</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>Liuli remembered something, producing a skull.  Slightly ashamed, she said, "It took a blow for me, allowing my escape. I wonder if it can be repaired."</p><p>Before parting, Qin Sang gave Liuli the corpse of Min Zhuo and some thunder talismans for protection.</p><p>The skull's luster was dull, a crack running from the skullcap to the brow, but Qin Sang didn't mind; it had served its purpose.</p>
