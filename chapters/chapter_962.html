<h1>Chapter 954 Jing'er</h1><p>Since arriving at the Canglang Sea, Qin Sang had been strategizing, figuring out how to gain Qingzhu's trust if he ever met him.  They were from the same school, both cultivating the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang*.</p><p>Those reasons alone might not be enough.</p><p>Qingzhu severed ties with Mount Shaohua to avenge his beloved, attacking the Yuanshen Gate.  How much affection remained between him and Mount Shaohua was uncertain.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to be caught in the crossfire.</p><p>And Old Madam Jing clearly had a deep connection with Qingzhu.</p><p>While their exact relationship was unclear, approaching him through Old Madam Jing seemed much better.</p><p>He was familiar with Old Madam Jing, and seeking her help wasn't unreasonable.</p><p>He possessed two items he'd obtained from her: a Star Spirit Net and a peachwood sword.</p><p>The peachwood sword was an ordinary mortal weapon.</p><p>Shortly after establishing his foundation, he'd asked Old Madam Jing for help finding a spiritual spring.  After a deal with the Le sisters, he'd bought the sword with spirit stones as payment.</p><p>Learning of Old Madam Jing's true cultivation, he'd initially suspected the sword held some secret, only to discover it was an unremarkable peachwood sword.</p><p>The Star Spirit Net might not have been crafted by Old Madam Jing herself, but the peachwood sword certainly was. Its unique carvings would be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with her.</p><p>He hadn't expected wielding the sword to have such an effect.</p><p>"Is Old Madam Jing's real name Qingjun, or…? I wonder what her relationship is with Senior Qingzhu…"</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He watched Qingzhu anxiously.</p><p>After the wooden sword appeared, Qingzhu let out a startled cry and then fell silent. His body trembled violently, as if two opposing energies were clashing within him.</p><p>"Ah…"</p><p>Qingzhu let out a series of anguished roars.</p><p>His face contorted, features shifting, eyes wide and bloodshot, he seemed to be in extreme pain, a terrifying sight.</p><p>Qin Sang was alarmed but remained calm, retreating cautiously.</p><p>Then, Qingzhu shouted.</p><p>"You dare…"</p><p>His voice trailed off. The bloodshot redness in his eyes receded like a tide, his expression quickly returning to normal, though his internal energy remained chaotic.</p><p>The same person, yet Qin Sang felt a completely different presence.</p><p>The previous Qingzhu was frenzied, sinister, bloodthirsty.</p><p>Now, his gaze was deep, his bearing unwavering as he stood in mid-air, like a divine sword, an image of unshakeable resolve, inspiring awe.</p><p>"Give me the sword!"</p><p>Qingzhu's gaze shifted to Qin Sang, his voice low and urgent.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced; he vaguely understood Qingzhu's state but remained uncertain.  Reason told him to retreat immediately.</p><p>Qingzhu was unstable, his body potentially about to be reclaimed by the other energy.</p><p>"Is this truly Senior Qingzhu before me?"</p><p>Qin Sang probed.</p><p>Qingzhu gently caressed the peachwood sword, his eyes filled with tender affection and a hint of faint regret, lost in contemplation of the sword.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not disturb him.</p><p>After a while, Qingzhu looked up at Qin Sang and nodded slightly.</p><p>Then, a commotion sounded behind them.  His external body arrived, sword in hand, badly battered, but not critically wounded.</p><p>Qingzhu, sensing Qin Sang's confusion, glanced at the external body and said softly, "It seems you've mastered the secret technique from the jade slip.  Know this, you're in great danger. Never allow your external body's cultivation to surpass your own, especially as your cultivation deepens. I am living proof of that."</p><p>Qin Sang understood immediately, bowing deeply to Qingzhu. "Junior respects your advice, thank you for the warning.  To pass the sword path trials, I had no choice. Senior, you…"</p><p>Before he could ask anything, Qingzhu waved a hand to stop him.</p><p>"I ask you, what is your relationship with Qingjun?"</p><p>A scrutinizing look entered Qingzhu's eyes as he sized Qin Sang up, his expression peculiar.</p><p>"Junior doesn't know Qingjun."</p><p>Qin Sang replied honestly. Seeing Qingzhu frown, he quickly explained, "If you mean the carver of the sword, I do know her, but only as Old Madam Jing, who once helped me…"</p><p>Qingzhu paused, his expression wistful.  "Old Madam Jing…Jing'er…she's become an old woman?  She…is she well?"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's puzzled expression,</p><p>Qingzhu sighed, "Jing'er, that was her childhood name, given by her mother. I named her Qingjun."</p><p>"It seems she still dislikes that name," he said.</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.  "Jing Po-po is your daughter...?"</p><p>"Yes, but not in the way you think. Jing'er's mother was my junior sister before I joined Shao Hua Mountain.  It was my senior sister who was killed by the Yuan Shen sect..."</p><p>Qing Zhu sighed deeply, "I have let down so many people in my life."</p><p>Qin Sang sensed Qing Zhu's unusual emotions and was curious about his past.  Qing Zhu seemed reluctant to speak further, and Qin Sang dared not press him.</p><p>"Tell me about Qing Jun.  Nothing else, just her," Qing Zhu cautioned.</p><p>Qin Sang, unsure of the situation, thought for a moment and said, "Senior, please rest assured. Before I met her, Jing Po-po was always well. Her cultivation was strange; looking back, it seemed to rival that of a Yuan Ying cultivator, yet also seemed slightly lacking.  At the very least, it was no weaker than my current incarnation. I first encountered Jing Po-po in Wen Yue Market... and later met her again outside Zhi Tian Peak.  Only then did I learn that her previous appearances were a disguise, a way to experience the mortal world.  Her true form was breathtakingly beautiful... At Zhi Tian Peak, she killed two Yuan Shen elders.  She aimed to overthrow Leng Yun Tian, the Yuan Shen sect leader, intending to use my Blood-Soaked Divine Light to defile the Five Directions Pagoda and..."</p><p>Qin Sang was about to mention "Zi Wei Palace" when Qing Zhu stopped her with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Throughout Qin Sang's account, Qing Zhu listened intently, questioning her thoroughly. He even inquired about every subtle expression, every frown and smile of Jing Po-po.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was a cultivator and, after much thought, was able to recall everything.</p><p>Qing Zhu listened, a gentle smile appearing on his face, no different from an ordinary father.</p><p>Qin Sang mentioned Leng Yun Tian's loss of the Five Directions Pagoda and then fell silent.</p><p>After a long silence, Qing Zhu's smile faded, his tone becoming heavy. "You never met her mother?"</p><p>"I didn't interact much with Jing Po-po, and she never mentioned her mother," Qin Sang replied carefully.</p><p>"It seems she has reunited with my senior sister... Good! Good!"</p><p>Qing Zhu's voice was filled with immense sorrow. He looked up at the dark clouds for a long time before saying softly, "To think Leng Qian is dead! I damaged Leng Yun Tian's foundation; his forced Yuan Ying ascension must have left him vulnerable. Losing the Five Directions Pagoda, he would be no match for Jing'er. Jing'er has been hiding, all because of me! Thankfully, she is doing well now, her cultivation has advanced, and I am relieved."</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Thank you to book friends 20111112152233284, Xuan Yuan Qing Huan, Xian Yu Er Liang, Ye Chan Zi, Yi Zhi Hui Fei De Ma Zha, and many others for your support!
