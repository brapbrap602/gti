<h1>Chapter 1988: The Obscured Bone Art</h1><p>“Stay at Bieguan this time. It will be more conducive to your Nascent Soul formation.”</p><p>Taiyi noticed that Yu Lang was already at the peak of Golden Core stage, only a step away from Nascent Soul.</p><p>Bieguan is a cultivation ground, a sacred place for practice.</p><p>Only by breaking through to Nascent Soul will one have the ability to stand on their own.  Only then will Yu Lang’s position as the Grand Master truly be deserved.</p><p>Yu Lang’s cultivation speed is considered genius even in the vast world, but given his status as a disciple of the Xuantian sect, this achievement isn't earth-shattering.</p><p>Taiyi knew that Yu Lang wasn't purely focused on cultivation; he thought about many things beyond his current level.</p><p>For example, during those years he spent traveling the world, his cultivation barely improved.</p><p>Since Qin Sang allowed Yu Lang to do this, there must be a reason, and Taiyi wouldn't interfere.</p><p>Taiyi activated his escape technique, his light enveloping Yu Lang as they flew to the top of Bieguan Mountain, activating the restrictions of the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't in the cave at this time; he was deep underground.</p><p>There's a reason why the Fallen Soul Abyss built its gate here.  The bottom of the ravine is where Yin energy gathers, exceptionally pure, and the black river is formed from this Yin energy.</p><p>The *Annihilation Yang Corpse Scripture* requires Yin energy to refine oneself.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely immersed in the black river, absorbing wisps of Yin energy into his body, using it to cultivate.</p><p>Thanks to the poison he refined using Spirit Erosion and several potent poisons sent by Gu Yun Sou, Qin Sang has cultivated the *Celestial Demon Transformation* to its fifth-layer peak. Once he reaches the sixth layer, he will possess a true Azure Luan Dharma Image.</p><p>Having reached this peak, Qin Sang clearly perceived the bottleneck.</p><p>Breaking through would grant him physical strength comparable to a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>At this stage, each hurdle is as difficult as ascending to heaven; countless people are blocked.</p><p>The vast majority of late-stage Metamorphosis cultivators are stuck here their entire lives.</p><p>This time, no powerful cultivator is infusing him with energy to help him experience the mysteries of a higher realm.</p><p>The *Celestial Demon Transformation* is an unparalleled skill.  Qin Sang is uniquely gifted, possessing a Dharma Image shadow at the Metamorphosis stage, which undoubtedly benefits his breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang is already a Void Refinement cultivator, albeit through a different path, but he can still learn from analogous situations.</p><p>However, Qin Sang needs to maximize his chances of success, aiming for a single breakthrough when the Star Yuan energy is infused, refining his cultivation while also accumulating more.</p><p>The higher the *Celestial Demon Transformation* reaches, the more it leans towards the Dao of Dharma Images.</p><p>After reaching the fifth-layer peak, Qin Sang felt that this cultivation method had not refined his body to its utmost limit; there’s room for improvement.  Continuing to refine his body might further aid his breakthrough.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang has spent these years studying the murals and the *Annihilation Yang Corpse Scripture*.</p><p>The *Annihilation Yang Corpse Scripture*, when cultivated to its peak, will transform the cultivator into an incorruptible bone body.</p><p>This isn’t like the desperate situation he faced during his Golden Core formation; Qin Sang has no intention of becoming a corpse again.</p><p>He decided to extract the essence of the *Annihilation Yang Corpse Scripture* and verify it with the murals to create his own body refinement method.</p><p>This method needn't be overly profound, nor should it be his primary cultivation technique. Qin Sang doesn’t need to consider its future potential; temporarily, he only needs to create the Metamorphosis stage portion, strengthening himself as much as possible before the breakthrough, as a secret technique.</p><p>It’s not too difficult for him.</p><p>Since it’s based on the *Annihilation Yang Corpse Scripture*, it must involve bone refinement.</p><p>With the source of the technique—the nine murals—and the insights of the Fallen Soul Abyss cultivators throughout history, Qin Sang quickly gathered his thoughts.</p><p>The core of the *Annihilation Yang Corpse Scripture* is using Yin energy to refine the bones. Combining this with the body refinement methods he obtained before, taking the essence and discarding the dross, and recalling the Wu tribe's Obscured Bone Markings, he named it the *Obscured Bone Art*!</p><p>Qin Sang is now bathing in the black river, silently running the *Obscured Bone Art*, absorbing the Yin energy.</p><p>As the Yin energy entered his body, piercing his skin and flesh, seeping into his bones, the extreme chill made Qin Sang feel as if he was in an ice cellar.</p><p>His expression was dark and unclear.  His bones ached and itched intensely, like they were being shattered inch by inch, then countless ants crawling inside.</p><p>A strange change was occurring within him.  Where the Yin energy touched his bones, distorted black lines appeared, like some kind of rune, eventually covering his entire body.</p><p>All the bones in his body turned as black as charcoal, as if they had already necrotized. The flesh and bones seemed to separate, and his life force was being consumed.</p><p>The moment Taiyi activated the restriction, Qin Sang immediately sensed it, his eyelids twitching.</p><p>His skin vibrated imperceptibly, pushing the “river water” away from his body. The Yin energy that had already entered was instantly devoured by his bones.</p><p>Qin Sang formed a hand seal, and his flesh and bones gradually returned to their normal color, his life force recovering.</p><p>Having tested his strength after a period of intense training, Qin Sang was quite pleased with his self-created secret techniques. He rose and left Black River.</p><p>The cave entrance opened.</p><p>Tai Yi performed a respectful bow and presented a bamboo slip.  "Master Qin, this is a message from Yun Du Tian, to be delivered to you."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang drew the bamboo slip towards him with a flick of his wrist.  Reading its contents, he learned that Yun Du Tian had just received the Ji Tian Order!</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun had guessed correctly; he wasn't at the sect, otherwise he would have come in person to discuss it.</p><p>The appearance of the Ji Tian Order meant the Ji Tian Assembly was only ten years away!</p><p>The Ji Tian Assembly was the grandest event in the entire Yue Du Bay cultivation world.  Powerful figures, rarely seen in everyday life, gathered from all factions, influencing everything. The Assembly’s events alone lasted half a year.</p><p>It could be said that this Assembly would determine the layout of the Yue Du Bay cultivation world until the next Ji Tian Assembly.</p><p>The Ji Tian Assembly was usually held at Ji Tian Sect, and this time was no exception.  Qin Sang would finally see the overlord of this world.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang said to Tai Yi, "Ten years from now, you and Yu Lang will accompany me on a trip."</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Tai Yi answered without question.</p><p>Taking them along to witness the Ji Tian Assembly and to network would benefit the Qing Yang Sect.  Yu Lang still needed to grow, and for a long time, Tai Yi would be the mainstay of the Qing Yang Sect.</p><p>Putting away the bamboo slip, Qin Sang inquired about Tai Yi's cultivation. "How has your training been?  Any problems?"</p><p>With Qin Sang's dedicated assistance, Tai Yi had become a mid-stage Nascent Divinity cultivator.</p><p>However, once Tai Yi reached the late-stage Nascent Divinity, Qin Sang's help would be limited.</p><p>Whether he could reach the Void Refinement stage would depend on Tai Yi's own destiny.</p><p>After giving guidance, Tai Yi returned to his quarters, while Yu Lang remained at the secondary temple to cultivate.</p><p>...</p><p>For over a hundred years, the cultivation world had been unusually peaceful and uneventful.</p><p>Ten years passed in a flash.</p><p>On this day, Qin Sang flew out of Black River, leaving the secondary temple.  He soared effortlessly over thousands of mountains and rivers, finally arriving at the Qing Yang Sect.</p><p>Since the Sect's construction, this was his first visit as its founding ancestor.</p><p>Tai Yi and Yu Lang, now a Yuan Ying cultivator, waited patiently in front of the main hall and quickly approached to greet him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't enter the hall, but stood with his hands behind his back, gazing at the vibrant temple, nodding slightly.  "Not bad!"</p><p>Receiving Qin Sang's approval, Tai Yi and Yu Lang felt relieved.  They had been anxious, afraid of disappointing him.</p><p>After a short pause, Qin Sang took them with him, leaving Qing Yang Sect and continuing east towards Yun Du Mountain.</p><p>Today was the day he and Old Man Gu Yun had agreed to depart.</p><p>Since entering this Great Thousand World, Qin Sang had long admired Yun Du Tian and this was his first visit.</p><p>Yun Du Tian's mountain gate was located on the main peak of Yun Du Mountain, a place of exceptional beauty and danger.</p><p>Approaching on a cloud, Qin Sang saw from afar a white ribbon cascading from the heavens.</p><p>Looking upward, the top of the waterfall was unseen, the scene ethereal and awe-inspiring.</p><p>A perpetual mist shrouded the area.  Behind the waterfall, a fairy-like peak appeared and disappeared, mysteriously alluring.</p><p>Yu Lang and Tai Yi had previously visited, but the initial shock still lingered in their expressions, even now.</p><p>From a distance, the waterfall was visible but silent.</p><p>As they drew closer, a deafening roar suddenly erupted, the water crashing onto the earth with thunderous force.</p><p>At that moment, a fissure split the waterfall, the water gently parting to reveal a rainbow gate.</p><p>Nine streams of light flew from the gate.</p><p>The nine streams of light stopped before the waterfall, arranged in a single line, revealing the Nine Immortals of Yun Du.</p><p>Each Immortal possessed outstanding bearing and an ethereal aura.  They bowed to the approaching cloud.  "We welcome Daoist Qingfeng!"</p><p>Qin Sang silently reflected that one day, the Qing Yang Sect might have so many masters, truly becoming a renowned sect.  He smiled and nodded, flying closer. Yun Xi stepped forward to personally guide Qin Sang.</p><p>Tai Yi and Yu Lang, familiar with some of the immortals, were guided by others.</p><p>Passing through the rainbow gate, the landscape suddenly opened up.</p><p>Peaks gathered like clouds, and clouds surged like angry waves.  The scene was magnificent.  Among the fairy mountains, countless pavilions and towers stood, with countless disciples, some curious, some awestruck, gazing in their direction.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Yun Xi to the main hall where Old Man Gu Yun waited. He laughed heartily. "Friend, why such a grand welcome?"</p><p>"For a distinguished guest, we cannot be remiss in our courtesies."</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun smiled and invited Qin Sang inside.  Yun Xi personally served them spiritual tea.</p><p>"I've invited a few fellow cultivators to travel with us.  Do you mind, Daoist Master?" Gu Yunshou asked.</p><p>"Not at all! I'd be delighted to meet more fellow cultivators."</p><p>Qin Sang turned and glanced outside the hall.</p><p>A pleasure boat floated beyond the mountain. It wasn't overly large but was elegantly designed, built entirely from extremely rare spirit wood, as Qin Sang instantly recognized.  The formations inscribed on the hull suggested it wasn't a warship, and its speed likely wouldn't be exceptional.  Was such expense simply for a means of transportation?</p><p>"This Shi Yun Treasure Ship was purchased at great cost from Yonggu Mountain.  The Jitian Fair has a rather unfortunate custom:  various sects start competing and showing off their flying artifacts.  Having an inferior flying artifact invites open ridicule.  If one wishes to avoid such expense, the options are to hitch a ride with another sect or forgo a flying artifact altogether and quietly enter the city.  I, too, cannot escape the custom…" Gu Yunshou said self-deprecatingly.</p><p>"I doubt Old Ancestor Ming Hu would choose to enter the city quietly.  He must have had a different method. Therefore, I must rely on your sect's fine vessel," Qin Sang laughed.  (He knew from Ming Hu's remaining belongings that he didn't possess a top-tier flying artifact).</p><p>"Of course! Of course!"</p><p>After some pleasantries, Gu Yunshou got down to business, mentioning the jade slip Qin Sang had given him.</p><p>"I have made progress on the Bi Yuan Frost Flower Divine Liquid you requested."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly. "Have you gathered all the ingredients for the formula?"</p><p>"Not yet, but I'm close," Gu Yunshou replied. "At the previous Jitian Fair, I befriended a master alchemist known as Yue. He has extraordinary skill and, unlike some alchemists, isn't eccentric. I always commission Yue to refine my superior elixirs, and I contacted him for assistance. Recently, he replied that he possesses the two rarest herbs needed, and is willing to provide them—but with one condition."</p><p>"What condition?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The Bi Yuan Frost Flower Divine Liquid was crucial to the cultivation of the Tianmu Butterfly.  Once the butterfly and his *Tianyao Lianxing* technique both made breakthroughs, he could consider departing. Whatever Yue's condition, he had to try and fulfill it.</p><p>"Yue wishes to meet the owner of the formula," Gu Yunshou said, a hint of confusion in his eyes.</p><p>Upon hearing the condition, he had initially suspected Yue had seen through Qin Sang's background, but upon further inquiry, this wasn't the case. Yue’s response was ambiguous, shrouded in mystery, yet he seemed quite eager. The reason for this was unclear.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang's mind raced, and he quickly guessed the reason.</p><p>The *Panhu True Scripture* was a profound method passed down from the Wu tribe. The formulas contained within differed greatly from human alchemical methods, holding significant appeal to human alchemists.</p><p>In the talisman world, Qin Sang had used formulas for exchange many times with success.</p><p>Yue had surely noticed the unique nature of the Bi Yuan Frost Flower Divine Liquid, but whether he had identified its Wu origins remained unknown.</p><p>Perhaps Yue knew some secrets about the Wu tribe, and Qin Sang might be able to learn their whereabouts from him.</p><p>Even without needing the elixir, Qin Sang needed to meet Yue!</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang said, "I am the owner of the formula. Yue will also attend the Jitian Fair, won't he? I would appreciate it if you could arrange a meeting between us."</p><p>Gu Yunshou readily agreed.</p><p>They continued discussing their journey.</p><p>Yun Xi quietly left and issued an order.  Figures flew out from the mountain and assembled before the Shi Yun Treasure Ship.</p><p>Tai Yi and Yu Lang were also brought.</p><p>Yun Du Tian had mobilized considerable manpower for this trip, with other forces from Yun Du Mountain also embarking. Soon, over a hundred people had gathered.</p><p>Including Yun Xi, four of the Nine Immortals of Yun Du were present.</p><p>The rest were elite disciples of Yun Du Tian, all at least at the Foundation Establishment stage, with representatives from each higher level of cultivation.</p><p>Each one was excited and expectant.  The Jitian Fair included competitions among disciples of various sects, offering substantial rewards.  Achieving a good ranking would not only bring honor to their sect but also represent a major opportunity.</p><p>The number was complete.</p><p>Yun Xi activated the Shi Yun Treasure Ship and ordered the disciples to board.</p><p>Gu Yunshou glanced outside the hall. "Daoist Master, it's time for us to depart."</p><p>"Please."</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>The Shi Yun Treasure Ship trembled. Waves rippled beneath it, its bow rising slightly.  A crystal embedded in the front suddenly emitted a green light.</p><p>In an instant, Yun Du Tian was bathed in the green glow.</p><p>A green light pierced the clouds and shot towards the heavens.</p><p>The void shook, the Shi Yun Treasure Ship expanding into a colossal vessel as it 'crashed' into the clouds, setting sail!</p><p>On the ship, there was no perceptible shaking.</p><p>Exiting Yun Du Tian, the green light diffused, concealing the ship and shielding it from outside observation.</p><p>The treasure ship quickly left Yun Du Mountain, flew across the Fire Domain, and continued northward.</p>
