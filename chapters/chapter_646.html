<h1>Chapter 638: Subjugation</h1><p>Everyone showed clear interest.</p><p>The alluring woman put away her seductive techniques and said seriously, "From today onwards, the Five Insects Sect will relinquish Black Wind Valley and will not set foot within its borders for two hundred years. We will withdraw immediately."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi hadn't expected such an outrageous demand and exploded with anger, his wooden staff hitting the ground.  "Two hundred years without Black Wind Valley? What will be left of the Five Insects Sect by then? You want to destroy our sect!"</p><p>The alluring woman didn't back down, countering sharply, "Your sect occupies the spirit stone mine and the poison spring in Black Wind Valley. Have you ever considered how cultivators from our two regions managed to survive? You can only blame the incompetence of your disciples.  Occupying such rich resources, yet showing no progress! We give you two choices:  stay out of Black Wind Valley for two hundred years, or hand over the spirit stones and poison spring extracted over the past hundred years."</p><p>Lei Gui, the old man, said, "Old Cui Xuan, I'll give you an incense stick's worth of time to consider. After that, I want to see just how strong the Five Insects Sect's protective formation really is!"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi's face was ashen.</p><p>Though he'd received a talisman treasure from Qin Sang, facing so many experts, defeat was his only option.</p><p>Even the strongest protective formation couldn't hold out for long without reinforcements.</p><p>Returning to the headmaster's hall, Cui Xuanzi gritted his teeth, pushed open the door, knelt before Qin Sang, and cried out, "Please, senior, save me!"</p><p>Qin Sang had overheard the arguments outside the mountain gate. He also thought that the Five Insects Sect's Gold Core cultivators were almost certainly dead.</p><p>In a place like the Western Frontier, a single Gold Core cultivator could protect a sect for three to five hundred years.</p><p>The fact that this person gathered surrounding forces before leaving and secured Black Wind Valley, which seemed resource-rich, indicated that they weren't inherently cruel.</p><p>Even for an ascetic cultivator, taking time to return once in a while shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang held his teacup, his gaze sharp as a blade, fixed on Cui Xuanzi without speaking.</p><p>The atmosphere in the hall suddenly froze. Cui Xuanzi felt an overwhelming pressure descend upon him, causing him great shock.  Cold sweat trickled down his forehead.</p><p>"You invited me to the mountain, just to wait for this moment?"</p><p>Qin Sang's voice was icy, filled with killing intent.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi's face changed drastically. He hurriedly explained himself, "Junior knows they've harbored ill intentions for a long time.  I hoped to gain favor with the senior and deter them. But even with a hundred lives, I wouldn't dare plot against the senior! I truly didn't know they would attack today!"</p><p>"Junior has served the senior diligently, without the slightest negligence. The senior's sharp eyes can certainly see this. Originally, I planned to forgo any reward from the senior and only request protection for the Five Insects Sect. But before I could speak, they arrived. Please, senior, understand!"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi remained prostrate, not even daring to wipe his sweat, appearing extremely humble.</p><p>The man didn't seem to be feigning it.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't relent, coldly snorting, "You dare say you served me diligently? When I asked about the secret realms around the Xiong Mountain region, why did you conceal Black Wind Valley and the poison spring?"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was startled and cried out his innocence, "Senior misunderstands! Black Wind Valley is not a secret realm. It merely contains a spirit stone vein, situated between the three forces, hence the contention. The poison spring has nothing extraordinary about it. The water it produces can nurture venomous insects, strengthening the poison in the bodies of first-stage venomous insects, accelerating their cultivation.  It has no effect on other types of insects. Even for venomous insects, after the second stage, the effect is minimal."</p><p>Qin Sang, of course, knew what the poison spring was.</p><p>The Imperial Spirit Sect had records of it; a naturally occurring poisonous place, the water itself was toxic and could help nurture venomous insects but didn't help with transformation.</p><p>Poison springs also had different levels; this one, only effective for first-stage insects, was the lowest type.</p><p>The methods Qin Sang knew for insect cultivation were all far more efficient than this poison spring.</p><p>However, for both the Five Insects Sect and the other two forces, Foundation Establishment cultivators were few and far between.  The majority were Qi Condensation cultivators. The poison spring could help Qi Condensation disciples improve their insects, so it's no wonder they valued it so much.</p><p>"If senior doesn't believe me, after this is settled, go and see Black Wind Valley for yourself."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi kowtowed again, "Please, senior, consider junior's diligent service and help junior this once."</p><p>"I, and the entire Wu Chong Sect, pledge our allegiance to you, esteemed senior!"</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly scoffed.  A cultivator of his level, a Nascent Soul stage cultivator, wouldn't deign to become a patron for a sect in such a barren place as West Frontier, a place he wouldn't stay long in. It would be a lowering of his status.</p><p>However, Qin Sang reconsidered. It might not be useless.</p><p>For over a month, Qin Sang had scoured much of the Xiong Mountain region, even searching the underground rivers, yet he still hadn't found the ancient teleportation array.  If he couldn't find it, before his departure, consolidating some local forces to help gather information wouldn't be a bad idea.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was clever; if he pledged his full allegiance, he could be helpful, especially since Ya Gu was still cultivating within the Wu Chong Sect.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang didn't immediately refuse, seeming to be pondering, Cui Xuanzi's heart leaped with joy. He quickly swore oaths, promising tribute of spirit stones and treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang was already tempted, but he knew he couldn't stay to watch over them.  It was best to prevent Cui Xuanzi from becoming too powerful. Subjugating the other factions and keeping them in check with the Wu Chong Sect would maintain stability and ensure they worked for him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't covet their resources; he didn't care for the spirit stone veins or the poisonous springs of Black Wind Valley. If these forces brought him trouble, he could simply leave.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang carefully inquired about the details of Jing Lei Village and Bai Hua Palace.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi knew them well, and wanted Qin Sang to destroy them, so he spoke very thoroughly, assuring Qin Sang he had nothing to worry about.</p><p>Because of the remote location, outside forces rarely paid attention, and neither Jing Lei Village nor Bai Hua Palace had any powerful backers.</p><p>After learning the details, Qin Sang nodded.  "Open the protective formation and let them in."</p><p>"Yes! I'll let them in immediately!"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi, overjoyed and very obedient, even referred to himself as a disciple, a habit Qin Sang sternly corrected.</p><p>...</p><p>"Old Cui Xuan, have you made up your mind?"</p><p>Lei Gui Lao Ren, seeing Cui Xuanzi return, loudly questioned him. He was confident that Cui Xuanzi would submit.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi had left with a worried expression, but now his face was full of smiles. Returning to the edge of the protective formation, he deactivated it, and coldly laughed, "If you dare, come in and talk!"</p><p>Lei Gui Lao Ren and the alluring woman exchanged a glance, believing Cui Xuanzi was bluffing.</p><p>Lei Gui Lao Ren spat, "Still trying to act mysterious at this point!"</p><p>With that, Lei Gui Lao Ren led the way, his group filing in, swaggering into the Wu Chong Sect and heading straight for the Grand Master's hall.</p>
