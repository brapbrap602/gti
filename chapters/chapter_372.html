<h1>Chapter 365: Disguise</h1><p>Yun Youzi mused, “On my last visit, my cultivation was far inferior to what it is now.  A single magical artifact would have sufficed for the journey. But to venture into the inner valley of Wuya Valley, it's best to purchase a couple more for safety.”</p><p>In Yinshan Pass, Yun Youzi explained the situation to Qin Sang. Their target was the inner valley of Wuya Valley, its most dangerous area.</p><p>Without Yun Youzi’s knowledge of a specific route, they would surely perish.</p><p>Qin Sang’s role would be to help Yun Youzi contain the strange beings and retreat. But Yun Youzi would have to risk his life, venturing deeper alone, a desperate gamble for survival.</p><p>Yun Youzi had clearly weighed the pros and cons before making this decision, so Qin Sang didn’t try to dissuade him.</p><p>The path of immortality is arduous; there are no easy victories.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  While these jade pendants were expensive, they weren't a significant burden. Yun Youzi's suggestion was wise.  They then discussed their plans and decided to depart in two days.</p><p>“…I never imagined a disciple of Mingyue would possess such talent. What are your thoughts, senior? If you are too busy to personally guide him, I could arrange for him to train on Shaohua Mountain.”</p><p>Qin Sang detailed the situation of Daoist Jixin and his apprentice, as well as Li Yu’s exceptional abilities, seeking Yun Youzi's advice.</p><p>In the mortal world, Li Yu was a disciple of Mingyue, and once a great-grand disciple of Yun Youzi.  This relationship could continue in their immortal cultivation.</p><p>If Yun Youzi was unwilling to take on another disciple, Qin Sang would recommend Li Yu to Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>This was already a far superior starting point for a cultivator.</p><p>“Master Jixin and his disciple remained true to their hearts and died honorably!”</p><p>Yun Youzi was very pleased to hear that Daoist Jixin and Mingyue were revered by the people, their names enshrined in countless family temples.</p><p>Regarding Li Yu's future, Yun Youzi pondered, “Qin, your insight is sharp. After meeting the Tan brothers, I’ve indeed considered taking on a successor. Since Li Yu has this prior connection with me in the mortal world, and shows such talent, there is no need to look further. However, my journey into Wuya Valley is uncertain…”</p><p>Yun Youzi paused, then produced a wooden token, giving it to Qin Sang.  “This is a disciple's token from the Taiyi Danzong. Take it. If I don't return, please take this to Qingyang Temple. Have Li Yu use it to enter the Taiyi Danzong as my disciple. I have some belongings stored in my master's abode that I want him to receive.”</p><p>When speaking of his possible demise in Wuya Valley, Yun Youzi's tone was calm, as if discussing someone unrelated to himself.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of sadness, took the token, and forced a smile.  “Senior, you haven't even met Li Yu, you don't know his character. To decide so hastily...if he turns out to be ungrateful, it would damage your reputation!”</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head, firm in his decision.  “Someone esteemed by both Master Jixin and Qin wouldn’t be ungrateful.”</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback, nodding softly.</p><p>…</p><p>On the third day, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi prepared themselves, purchased two more jade pendants, and departed from Qingyang Market, flying deeper into the Tian Duan Mountains.</p><p>They traveled without rest, reaching the vicinity of Wuya Valley within five days.</p><p>From afar, they saw a crimson glow in the eastern sky, blood-red clouds obscuring the heavens, stretching north and south beyond their sight.</p><p>While named a valley, Wuya Valley wasn't a mere mountain gorge, but a vast and mysterious region.</p><p>The mountains rose and fell in undulating waves; Wuya Valley lay deep within this mountain range.  As they entered the mountains, still some distance from the valley itself, they noticed faint, blood-red mist drifting in the air, an intense chill permeating the area.</p><p>This blood-red mist was the emanation of Wuya Valley's blood miasma.</p><p>A single breath of this miasma would feel like plunging into an icy abyss.  Those with insufficient cultivation, once tainted, would have the poison invade their internal organs, beyond saving.</p><p>The surrounding mountain range was barren, devoid of medicinal herbs, which is why cultivators rarely ventured there unless heading for Wuya Valley itself.</p><p>Gazing towards Wuya Valley, Yun Youzi said, “Qin, the first level of Wuya Valley is relatively safe, compared to the second and third, but it’s still fraught with danger.  The first level has the most cultivators.  They often disturb demonic lairs and trigger ancient prohibitions, causing upheaval within the valley. The first level transforms periodically. My previous experiences may not be very useful. We could hire a guide, or disguise ourselves as herb gatherers, joining another group to save time…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement; the information he'd gathered in Qingyang Market echoed Yun Youzi's words.</p><p>The deeper into Wuya Valley, the stronger the demons and monsters, but unlike the outer regions, they weren’t clustered together. Those who ventured into the valley were extremely cautious.</p><p>The first level has seen frequent incidents, even beast tides.</p><p>…</p><p>A desolate mountain range.</p><p>From afar, it looks unremarkable.  Only up close can one see faint ripples in the air, shielding the bloody miasma from penetrating.</p><p>Two streaks of light sped in from the southwest, about to pass over the range, when the occupants seemed to notice something unusual and abruptly stopped.</p><p>The lights dissipated, revealing Qin Sang and Yun Youzi.</p><p>The two exchanged a glance.</p><p>Yun Youzi said, “These restrictions only block the miasma and serve as an early warning; there’s no protective formation. It must be one of the mobile market towns. Let’s go in. We’re sure to find a herbal gathering team there.”</p><p>These mobile market towns are unique to the area outside the Wuyaya Valley.</p><p>Whenever the Wuyaya Valley experiences disturbances, such as miasma expansion or beast tides, the inhabitants abandon the market town and flee. It's easy enough to set up some simple restrictions; it costs them little.</p><p>Once the valley calms down, they return and rebuild elsewhere.</p><p>Over time, this became the norm.</p><p>The market town Yun Youzi had visited last time was now ruins.  They had to search extensively to find this one.</p><p>“If we meet anyone, tell them we’re entering Wuyaya Valley to collect Huanglong Grass.”</p><p>Qin Sang, hearing Yun Youzi’s transmitted message, nodded slightly and followed him into the market town.</p><p>Huanglong Grass grows mostly in the deepest part of the first level of Wuyaya Valley, not far from the second.  They would disguise themselves as herbalists gathering Huanglong Grass, then slip away from the group once they arrived.</p><p>The buildings in the market town were exceptionally crude.</p><p>Roughly stacked stones formed simple houses, or crooked, low wooden huts serving as shops, scattered haphazardly across the mountain range.</p><p>The streets were winding and unplanned.</p><p>Yet, many of these seemingly insignificant shops belonged to well-known trading companies in the cultivation world.</p>
