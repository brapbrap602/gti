<h1>Chapter 527: Firestorm!</h1><p>The higher up the mountain, the fewer people there were.</p><p>Qin Sang realized that the distribution of people on Divine罡 Peak was based on cultivation level. The closer to the summit, the more chaotic the spiritual energy became, and only those with sufficiently high cultivation could withstand it.</p><p>The benefit was the ability to absorb purer罡 Qi, thus accelerating cultivation speed.</p><p>Whether this chaotic spiritual energy was related to the Ancestral Sacred Flame at the summit, Qin Sang couldn't quite figure out.</p><p>Quietly passing by a Qingyang Demonic Sect cultivator, Qin Sang finally spotted a jade-like piece of Qingyang罡 Essence embedded in the center of a boulder.</p><p>The boulder was shaped like a millstone on its side, and the Qingyang罡 Essence was nestled right in the middle.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, cautiously approached the boulder, and reached out.  A wave of coldness emanated from the Qingyang罡 Essence. After careful examination, Qin Sang was delighted to discover that the罡 Qi within was incredibly pure, requiring no refinement. Even if he didn't cultivate the Qingyang Demonic Flame, he could absorb it directly.</p><p>Reassured, Qin Sang continued his ascent, searching back and forth until he finally found a well-hidden piece of Qingyang罡 Essence within a crevice.</p><p>This was the spot!</p><p>This piece of Qingyang罡 Essence wasn't large, about the size of a baby's fist.  Based on what Qin Sang had learned about Qingyang罡 Essence over the past few days, this was more than enough!</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled slowly, took out the Lesser Yin Magnetic Flasks from his robe, and placed them before him. He sensed the Qingyang罡 Essence again to confirm its purity.</p><p>Then, he opened all the flasks at once, absorbing all the Earthly Yin Qi within his body.  He then destroyed the flasks to eliminate any trace.</p><p>Once he commenced the罡-Yin Fusion, he wouldn't be able to be distracted. He had to forcibly draw the Earthly Yin Qi into his Qi Sea. He could maintain stability for a short period, and as the Earthly Yin Qi was consumed, it would become increasingly easier to manage.</p><p>"I must succeed!"</p><p>Qin Sang encouraged himself, dispelling his nervous anticipation. He quickly cleared his mind, achieving a state of tranquility.</p><p>He sat cross-legged before the Qingyang罡 Essence, his hands hovering over it, maintaining this posture without moving a muscle.</p><p>A moment later, the Qingyang罡 Essence flashed with azure light, releasing a streak of azure brilliance that danced around Qin Sang's fingertips before vanishing.</p><p>Within Qin Sang's body:</p><p>The罡 Qi flowed through his meridians, quickly approaching his Qi Sea.</p><p>This strand of Divine罡 was several times larger than the one Shi Ying had gathered. Qin Sang held his breath, directing the Ebony Sword into his dantian. He carefully calmed his Qi Sea, then drew out a comparable amount of Earthly Yin Qi, awaiting its arrival!</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>The moment the two energies made contact, they predictably erupted into chaos. Qin Sang, anticipating this, immediately propelled the Earthly Yin Qi toward his Golden Core, guiding the Divine罡 along with it.  Then, he exerted all his spiritual power, tightly enveloping them, striving to pacify the raging energies.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The first attempt failed, his Qi Sea churning violently before gradually calming down.</p><p>Qin Sang's confidence grew. He laughed, unhesitatingly attempting again!</p><p>Repeated failures did nothing to shake his resolve.</p><p>Time slowly passed. After countless attempts, Qin Sang's expression suddenly shifted.</p><p>A faint point of light appeared on the surface of his Golden Core. Within the point of light, azure and black radiance intertwined.</p><p>The罡-Yin Fusion had finally succeeded!</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy, then his expression turned serious. His suspicions were confirmed; the罡-Yin Fusion was indeed different from the simple Earthly Yin Infusion. His Golden Core was extremely unstable, threatening to collapse at any moment.</p><p>Once started, he had to continue without pause!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare hesitate. He quickly absorbed another strand of罡 Qi and sent it to his Qi Sea, continuing to impact his Golden Core.</p><p>Performing the secret technique on himself felt different from the last time.  Qin Sang could acutely and rapidly perceive every minute change, allowing him to make adjustments.</p><p>Not only was the罡-Yin Fusion faster than before, but the Corpse Refining secret technique was also progressing smoothly.</p><p>Of course, the ever-ready Ebony Sword played a crucial role in ensuring such smooth progress.</p><p>On Divine罡 Peak, the Ancestral Sacred Flame danced wildly.</p><p>The Qingyang Demonic Sect disciples were oblivious to the fact that someone was stealing their sect's treasure.</p><p>Time continued to slip by.</p><p>Unknowingly, an hour and a half passed.  The Qingyang罡 Essence before Qin Sang had shrunk considerably. The secret technique was nearing completion.</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware that as the Qingyang罡 Essence diminished, the summit of Divine罡 Peak was undergoing a gradual transformation!</p><p>The Ancestral Sacred Flame grew more violent than before.</p><p>Influenced by the Ancestral Sacred Flame, the weather on Divine罡 Peak abruptly changed, and thunder roared.</p><p>The sudden, dramatic change alarmed the Qingyang Demonic Sect's experts.</p><p>"Didn't the Sect Master adjust the罡 Jade Formation to suppress the Ancestral Sacred Flame? Why this sudden change? Or did someone disregard the Sect Master's orders and excessively absorb罡 Jade, affecting the formation?"</p><p>Cave entrances opened one after another.  Two powerful figures emerged before Divine罡 Peak, both possessing the late Foundation Establishment cultivation.</p><p>They sent the onlookers back to their caves and looked up at the summit with grave expressions.</p><p>"Only a few of our fellow disciples are capable of absorbing罡 Jade. Elder Wu has taken Senior Brother Li and the others to Boundless Valley for the rescue mission.  Who could still be on the mountain?"</p><p>One of them frowned.  "Fortunately, the Ancestral Sacred Flame is not yet out of control.  It shouldn't be difficult to remedy. Let's send the other disciples down the mountain. Whether it's人为 or a change in the formation, we'll find out once we go up."</p><p>The other's face was filled with anger. "I just had a flash of inspiration, a potential breakthrough, but it was interrupted.  Now I can't recall anything.  Let me find out who did this, and I'll make them pay!"</p><p>Qin Sang was still oblivious to the changes outside.</p><p>How could he know that the stability of the Ancestral Sacred Flame was connected to the罡 Jade on Divine罡 Peak?  This was a secret of the Qingyang Demonic Sect, known only to the upper echelons.  Naturally, it wasn't something he could casually inquire about.</p><p>Even if he knew, he couldn't move freely now.</p><p>His Golden Core had undergone a drastic transformation.</p><p>It had turned into two distinct colors, azure and black, each occupying half.  The original golden light of the Core was reduced to a small area.</p><p>Once that small area was also overtaken, the罡-Yin Fusion would be complete!</p><p>Another wave of罡-Yin energy successfully surged into the Golden Core.  Just as Qin Sang was about to absorb more Divine罡, he heard an angry shout from below, "Stop!"</p><p>Qin Sang froze and turned to see two figures flying towards him through the azure mist.</p><p>He was so close to succeeding. Why would someone suddenly come up the mountain and discover him so easily?</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat.  He looked up and was shocked to find a swirling vortex of wind and clouds above him.</p><p>The vortex hung low, lightning flashing within. A thread-like stream of fire descended from the vortex, radiating a terrifying power that made his heart pound!</p><p>This was…</p><p>The Ancestral Sacred Flame!</p><p>Qin Sang's face paled. He realized he had overlooked something crucial.</p><p>At this moment, he was extremely drained, his body empty, having expended a vast amount of energy on the罡-Yin Fusion!</p>
