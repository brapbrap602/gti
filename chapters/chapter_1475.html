<h1>Chapter 1467: External Avatar </h1><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Liuli remained silent.</p><p>The wooden door slammed shut.</p><p>Shi Xue's figure stiffened, and she let out a long sigh. She stopped in her tracks, turning her head to look at the tightly closed wooden building. Her expression was a mix of heartache and helplessness. "That stubborn girl!"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the wooden building, then looked down at the ice sword embedded in the ground. Gradually, he began to understand.</p><p>He held the "Goddess Heart Scripture" in his hand and looked at Shi Xue with a mix of amusement and exasperation. With his intelligence, even though he didn't know the full story, seeing the scripture Shi Xue had given him and Liuli's earlier reaction, he could guess about seventy to eighty percent of the truth.</p><p>There were still residual fluctuations inside the wooden building.</p><p>It was clear that Liuli had been attempting to break through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage but had failed. Since Shi Xue had given him the "Goddess Heart Scripture," it was likely that Liuli's failure was related to him.</p><p>Or rather, it was due to the lingering imprint left by the "Mysterious Jade Cauldron True Scripture."</p><p>It seemed that Dongyang Bo's earlier warning had not been an exaggeration. The hidden dangers of this sinister technique were indeed troublesome. Even after nearly three hundred years, Liuli still couldn't rid herself of the imprint.</p><p>No wonder Liuli, with her heavenly spiritual root, was still stuck at the early Nascent Soul stage, while he had surpassed her.</p><p>Since their reunion, Liuli's behavior in front of him had seemed normal. Qin Sang had thought that with the vast resources of the Mystic Heaven Palace, there must be some secret technique or treasure that could help her resolve the issue.</p><p>He had even thought that this outcome wasn't bad, as it would sever the karmic ties between them.</p><p>But it turned out to be just a facade.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that back in the Bronze Hall of the Purple Palace, Dongyang Bo had mentioned that Liuli had been suffering from the backlash of the sinister technique from the very beginning, using silver needles to lock away her emotions and shield herself from the imprint's influence.</p><p>Now, it seemed she was using a similar method to seal away the emotional imprint.</p><p>Unfortunately, she had underestimated the power of the hidden dangers of this sinister technique. Just as she was on the verge of breaking through, the sealing technique failed, and the imprint erupted, causing her to fall short.</p><p>Thinking of the look in Liuli's eyes when her emotions had burst forth earlier, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>That bone-deep emotion was heart-wrenching, but the tragedy was that this emotion wasn't real. It wasn't born from her true heart but was instead a product of the sinister technique's imprint.</p><p>And Liuli clearly knew this, maintaining her true heart with strength and not succumbing to it.</p><p>"Elder Shi..."</p><p>Qin Sang walked up to Shi Xue and handed the jade slip back to her, unsure of what to say. "You... really overthought this."</p><p>Some time ago, he had noticed that Shi Xue's behavior was a bit odd. Now he realized she had been thinking about all this.</p><p>He guessed that Shi Xue didn't know about the dual cultivation aspect. If she had consulted him earlier, he would have advised her to give up and not waste her efforts. Regardless of his attitude, Liuli would never agree.</p><p>The facts proved this. Liuli had resolutely closed the wooden building, choosing to give up this opportunity to break through rather than consider the possibility of dual cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't the least bit surprised by this outcome.</p><p>Liuli was a proud daughter of heaven, a completely different kind of person from him.</p><p>What a proud woman!</p><p>Back then, she had practiced the sinister technique of dual cultivation out of desperation to save her master, not for her own benefit.</p><p>Now, to improve her own cultivation, to yield to the imprint and let the sinister technique dictate her actions, to form a Dao companion with someone she had almost no connection with—even under the guise of dual cultivation—was absolutely impossible.</p><p>Call her stubborn or headstrong.</p><p>She wouldn't numb herself into accepting this false emotion.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli hadn't interacted much, but through her actions, he understood her thoroughly. If Liuli could accept the "Goddess Heart Scripture," she wouldn't be herself.</p><p>"Fairy Liuli is blessed by the heavens. She will surely find a way to resolve this. We just need to trust her and not let our concern cloud our judgment."</p><p>Qin Sang treated the whole incident as a farce, shook his head, and flew out of the valley to attend to his own matters.</p><p>Shi Xue watched Qin Sang's retreating figure, her eyes flickering with uncertainty. She quickly walked up to the wooden building, hesitated for a moment, but ultimately didn't push the door open. Instead, she stood guard outside.</p><p>"That heartless man has a point. I was indeed letting my concern cloud my judgment. With my junior sister's intelligence, knowing the dangers of sealing her emotions with ice, she must have considered the possibility of failure. But aside from the 'Goddess Heart Scripture,' which uses emotions to enter the Dao, what other method could allow her to break through before the calamity?"</p><p>Shi Xue pondered for a long time, sighing inwardly. "Ah, junior sister, I understand you even less than that heartless man. Why are you so unwilling to accept him?"</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang left the Listening Snow Pavilion and headed northeast.</p><p>Treading lightly on the snow, he flew for a short while before seeing a vast expanse of snowy mountains. He had returned to this place.</p><p>The underground yin vein Shi Xue had mentioned was located beneath the snowy mountains.</p><p>Not long after entering the mountains, Qin Sang sensed a faint yin energy. His gaze swept downward, piercing through the snow layer to discover the entrances to several underground caves—the source of the yin energy.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A hole opened in the snow layer, and Qin Sang entered the cave.</p><p>The underground caves were interconnected, forming a complex network.</p><p>He summoned the Golden Sinking Sword to protect himself and ventured deeper into the caves, continuing his search.</p><p>As Shi Xue had said, there was indeed an underground yin vein here, but its strength varied. Some areas had thin yin energy, while others were extremely dense, like scattered yin pools distributed throughout the caves.</p><p>The first step of the "Nine Nether Return to Yin" required the use of an underground yin vein, taking eighty-one days to refine the spiritual body.</p><p>This step was different from refining a corpse. It didn't involve completely transforming the body with yin energy but rather using the power of the underground yin vein to make slight modifications. The true purpose wasn't to absorb the yin but to harness the cold, making it easier to refine cold materials later and increasing the success rate of the next step. Ultimately, the yin energy would be expelled from the body.</p><p>Thus, the requirements for the underground yin vein were high. The yin energy couldn't be too strong or too weak.</p><p>Qin Sang had already spent a long time searching the caves. This time, after another full day, he finally selected three locations and chose one of them.</p><p>This place was a cavern with smooth, mirror-like walls that seemed to stretch endlessly into the depths.</p><p>Qin Sang used his sword to carve out a stone platform and sat down cross-legged, summoning the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>In the process of refining the external avatar using the Nascent Soul puppet, not only was it related to whether the Dao Evolution Tree could refine the spiritual body, but also how the puppet's seals and soul shadows could be refined for the avatar's use.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet and the spiritual body required by the "Nine Nether Return to Yin" had some differences. Qin Sang might need to make slight modifications to the technique, combining it with the soul shadow refinement technique Bai had passed on to him.</p><p>Fortunately, the modifications wouldn't be too extensive and wouldn't affect the core of the technique. The chances of success were high, but extreme caution was required.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Nascent Soul puppet to sit cross-legged opposite him. He couldn't help but recall the drama from the previous day, still feeling a sense of absurdity. Shi Xue, as the sect leader, had truly gone to great lengths.</p><p>Setting aside his distracting thoughts, Qin Sang connected his mind to the puppet and sank into deep contemplation.</p><p>The cave fell into silence.</p><p>...</p><p>This meditation lasted two months.</p><p>In two months, Qin Sang had thoroughly comprehended the "Nine Nether Return to Yin Jade Chapter."</p><p>Liuli had previously said that if the main body died, the external avatar could be revived. This was somewhat exaggerated. The technique required the main body and avatar transformation technique from the "Nine Nether Return to Yin Jade Chapter" to be performed just before death to achieve this.</p><p>If the technique wasn't completed before being instantly killed, revival was impossible.</p><p>However, in the North Sea cultivation world, there likely wasn't anyone powerful enough to kill him before he could complete the transformation technique. For Qin Sang, this was indeed a genuine chance at revival.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang was very focused on the "Nine Nether Return to Yin Jade Chapter."</p><p>He had mentally simulated the process countless times and confirmed a few things.</p><p>First, the puppet's seal power within the Nascent Soul puppet couldn't be retained. He had to erase the seals first, restoring the Dao Evolution Tree to its original state. Otherwise, it would conflict with the spiritual body.</p><p>This was a pity. If he could fuse the seal power, the external avatar would have at least mid-Nascent Soul strength upon completion.</p><p>But to reduce conflict and increase the chances of success, it had to be done.</p><p>Second, there was good news.</p><p>The external avatar could be controlled by the main body, similar to a puppet. The downside was rigidity, and it couldn't be used for revival, so it was generally not considered. The orthodox method was to split off a second primordial spirit to control it, giving it more autonomy and allowing it to do more.</p><p>The second primordial spirit was split from the main primordial spirit, unlike the second primordial spirits created by demonic methods through bloody rituals. Unless the main body granted it complete autonomy or it broke free due to special circumstances, there was no need to worry about the second primordial spirit rebelling.</p><p>This had its pros and cons. When the external avatar was refined, its cultivation level would be one stage lower than the main body and would need to be improved over time.</p><p>Qin Sang's plan was to refine the second primordial spirit first, then use the technique Bai had passed on to him to refine the soul shadows within the Nascent Soul puppet, strengthening the second primordial spirit.</p><p>Bai had suggested he cultivate the orthodox external avatar technique for this very reason.</p><p>Although the soul shadows within the Nascent Soul puppet were just remnants, there were enough of them. Previously, they couldn't be converted into combat power. If they were all refined, combined with treasures like the Ice Soul Divine Essence, the external avatar's strength might not decrease but could even increase. This was a shortcut.</p><p>The soul shadows themselves had no consciousness, and the primordial spirit he split off contained some of the Jade Buddha's power. There was no need to worry about the second primordial spirit refining too much of the soul shadow power, increasing the risk of rebellion.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts gradually became clear, and he awoke from his meditation.</p><p>His gaze shifted from the Nascent Soul puppet to the underground yin vein, then back again as he sank his mind into his dantian.</p><p>Within his dantian, his primordial spirit was clad in Yin-Yang armor, concealing its golden light.</p><p>In the past, when refining corpses or puppets, Qin Sang had split off parts of his primordial spirit to create soul imprints.</p><p>This time was different. He needed to split off a large portion of his primordial spirit to refine the second primordial spirit!</p><p>Remembering the pain of splitting his primordial spirit in the past, Qin Sang grimaced, then calmed his mind and entered a meditative state. He removed the Yin-Yang armor from his primordial spirit, revealing its true form.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang's brow suddenly furrowed, and a flash of pain crossed his face.</p><p>The pain of splitting his primordial spirit was excruciating. Even with Qin Sang's mental fortitude, he couldn't help but show his discomfort.</p><p>At this moment, a ball of golden light appeared in his dantian, though it was much dimmer than his main primordial spirit.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang activated the technique.</p><p>As time passed, the ball of golden light wriggled and transformed, gradually taking on the form of his main body. The second primordial spirit was taking shape!</p><p>In the next moment, a golden light flashed at Qin Sang's brow.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The golden light entered the Nascent Soul puppet's body.</p><p>In an instant, the soul shadows within the Nascent Soul puppet showed signs of agitation, wanting to devour the still-weak second primordial spirit.</p><p>Enduring the pain, Qin Sang's hand seals changed rapidly as he activated the soul-suppressing technique Bai had passed on to him. The second primordial spirit delved into the core of the soul shadows and sat motionless, emitting a special fluctuation that gradually calmed the soul shadows.</p><p>Refining the soul shadows would take a long time and couldn't be done in one go.</p><p>Qin Sang first used the second primordial spirit to suppress the soul shadows. Next, he erased the puppet's seal power within the Nascent Soul puppet, restoring the Dao Evolution Tree.</p><p>After confirming that everything was in order, Qin Sang pointed a finger, and the puppet's seal light flickered.</p><p>As Qin Sang acted, the seals shattered one by one, their power dissipating. The Nascent Soul puppet's aura weakened, and its wooden texture gradually became apparent.</p><p>Qin Sang watched as the once-powerful puppet lost its power, showing no regret. Instead, his movements became faster and faster until the last seal was erased.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet disappeared, and in Qin Sang's palm was a small, delicate spiritual tree. Only now did he realize it was indeed a natural spiritual root.</p><p>Apart from its slightly rough bark, it was shaped like an infant, with all its features intact. Who could have imagined that a spiritual tree could be so naturally formed, resembling a human?</p><p>Next, Qin Sang placed the Dao Evolution Tree into the underground yin vein.</p><p>The Dao Evolution Tree floated up and down within the yin vein.</p><p>Qin Sang continuously formed hand seals, guiding the Dao Evolution Tree to absorb the power of the underground yin vein and refine the spiritual body. This was the second most crucial step after refining the Ice Soul Divine Essence, and Qin Sang didn't dare to relax.</p><p>Although the Dao Evolution Tree had been contaminated, it was still a natural spiritual root, capable of absorbing all things. The process of absorbing yin energy went smoothly, and Qin Sang's worries were unfounded.</p><p>The entire refinement process would take eighty-one days. After completing the hand seals, it could refine itself without constant supervision.</p><p>Seeing that everything was proceeding smoothly, Qin Sang withdrew his mind and took a pill to heal his primordial spirit.</p><p>With nothing else to do, Qin Sang stayed here, contemplating the "Seven Master Buddha Seals."</p><p>Unexpectedly, this step encountered a minor hiccup. The refinement, which should have taken eighty-one days, ended up taking over half a year before the spiritual body was finally completed.</p><p>The extended time made Qin Sang somewhat uneasy, but knowing the Dao Evolution Tree's uniqueness, he patiently waited until the day finally arrived.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Dao Evolution Tree flew into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the tree now had a faint cold light emanating from it. After observing it for a while, Qin Sang felt that there shouldn't be any issues and took out the Ice Soul Bag from his Qiankun Ring.</p><p>Opening the Ice Soul Bag, a chilling aura rushed out, carrying a terrifyingly violent intent.</p><p>Qin Sang was no stranger to the Heavenly Yang Divine Essence and remained calm as he looked inside.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Essence had condensed into jade, different from the Azure Yang Divine Essence. Its body was transparent like ice, resembling ordinary ice. Although it was a Heavenly Yang Divine Essence, an extremely yang substance, it had an extremely cold nature, which was quite peculiar.</p><p>Fortunately, the yin energy within the Dao Evolution Tree had already been expelled after the initial refinement of the spiritual body, or else conflicts might have arisen.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang took out a piece of Ice Soul Jade, not daring to touch it directly. He wrapped it in his true essence and activated the technique Liuli had passed on to him to refine it.</p><p>Gradually, the jade returned to its pure Ice Soul Divine Essence form, its coldness intensifying. The surrounding yin energy seemed to freeze in place.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's guidance, a strand of the Ice Soul Divine Essence separated and entered the Dao Evolution Tree.</p><p>In an instant, the Dao Evolution Tree's cold aura surged, and its body became somewhat transparent, easily absorbing the strand of Ice Soul Divine Essence.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression showed surprise as his understanding of the Dao Evolution Tree deepened. Without hesitation, he quickly refined strand after strand of Ice Soul Divine Essence into the Dao Evolution Tree.</p><p>With the spiritual body complete, the Ice Soul Divine Essence formed a foundation within the Dao Evolution Tree.</p><p>At this point, the external avatar could be considered complete!</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, surprised at how smoothly everything had gone. He silently praised the natural spiritual root.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang activated the second primordial spirit within the Dao Evolution Tree, taking advantage of the foundation's completion to fully merge the second primordial spirit with the tree, making them inseparable.</p><p>The external avatar was finally complete!</p>
