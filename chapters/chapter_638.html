<h1>Chapter 630 The Holy Maiden</h1><p>Although he had mastered this divine ability without a teacher, skillful use wasn't easy.  The sword light Qin Sang had conjured was full of flaws and lasted only a short time, useless in combat.  As he traveled, he pondered, finding the Way of the Sword ever more profound.</p><p>The path to immortality is long and arduous; every path is difficult!</p><p>He soon arrived at the upper reaches of the river where he had drifted.  Flying low, Qin Sang spread his spiritual sense, extending it underground to check the underground river for any unseen presence.</p><p>He found nothing.</p><p>Entering the Qingyi River, Qin Sang concealed himself and floated downstream, landing behind Qianhu Village. He frowned slightly; the room was empty.</p><p>Since his recovery and breakthrough, less than twenty days had passed. Yet, a thin layer of dust covered the desk in Ya Gu's room, and she was gone.</p><p>Ya Gu was very diligent. If she were still living here, she would have cleaned every day.</p><p>"Has she been accepted by her tribe after her birthmark and muteness were cured?"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered, leaping towards the front of the village, but still couldn't find Ya Gu.</p><p>Since her grandmother's death, Ya Gu had lived alone, unaccepted by her people.  Too afraid to travel far, she had never left the mountain of Qianhu Village since childhood.</p><p>Even during the Witch God Festival, when the surrounding villages held gatherings, singing and dancing, Ya Gu could only stand alone on the mountaintop, gazing longingly at the festivities.</p><p>"The Witch God Festival is coming soon. Did Ya Gu make a friend and go to the gathering together?"</p><p>Qin Sang knew Ya Gu looked forward to the Witch God Festival, trying to think positively, but he felt something was wrong.</p><p>His spiritual sense swept out, finally locating a familiar person—Ya Gu's grandfather, the village shaman.</p><p>The old man was Qianhu Village's only shaman, holding a high position. His stilt house was one of the best in the village, facing the Qingyi River with a broad view.</p><p>Currently, the elder was grinding medicine in his room, lacking his usual gentleness.  His face was grim, as if he had a grudge against the pestle, pounding with unusual force.</p><p>"Who's there?"</p><p>The old man caught sight of the moving curtain, sensing a figure, and immediately grew alert.</p><p>Then, the room darkened as a young man appeared silently by the window, like a ghost. He wasn't from the village, yet his face seemed vaguely familiar.</p><p>The old man's gaze shifted to the man's left shoulder; his arm was intact.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>The old man picked up his walking stick, highly wary.</p><p>"Don't you remember me, sir?"</p><p>Having taken several of the old man's remedies, though ineffective, Qin Sang remained polite. He said warmly, "Some time ago, I was severely injured, my arm broken, drifting on the river.  I was fortunate enough to be saved by you and Ya Gu. My injuries are finally healed, and I've come to express my gratitude, but I can't find Ya Gu. Do you know where she is?"</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>The old man remembered Qin Sang, his eyes reddening.  His face contorted in anger; he gritted his teeth and snarled, "Ya Gu saved your life, yet you caused her such misery!  You still have the nerve to mention her?!"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, saying sternly, "Ya Gu saved my life.  How could I harm her? Before I left, I was grateful for Ya Gu's kindness and gave her medicine to cure her muteness and birthmark, allowing her to return to a normal life… What exactly happened?"</p><p>Qin Sang realized something must have happened during this time.</p><p>He knew that after Ya Gu's recovery, her life would drastically change, and her fellow villagers would investigate the cause of her healing.</p><p>The cure of one ailment might be believable.</p><p>But the miraculous cure of two difficult conditions would undoubtedly cause a sensation.</p><p>Ya Gu, lacking strength, might have brought misfortune upon herself.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang had warned Ya Gu to pretend she was still mute, telling the villagers that her grandfather, the shaman, had used a rare and extraordinary medicine to remove her birthmark.</p><p>Qianhu Village considered Ya Gu a bad omen, largely due to appearances, believing her birthmark was a curse from the Witch God.</p><p>Removing the birthmark would allow Ya Gu to try to integrate with her people and live a normal life.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to return to teach Ya Gu magic or martial arts.  Then Ya Gu would have the means to protect herself, and when she spoke, she would no longer be afraid.</p><p>Unexpectedly, an accident occurred in such a short time.</p><p>He had even left a charm for emergencies, but it hadn't worked.</p><p>"Who harmed Ya Gu?"</p><p>Qin Sang's face turned cold, his eyes filled with a deep killing intent.</p><p>The old man sensed Qin Sang's sudden change, as if a killer had descended upon the world.</p><p>The old man, his heart heavy with grief for the mute girl, fearlessly pointed at Qin Sang, his voice filled with hatred.  "Because you cured her birthmark, she was chosen by the Yi Hui Tribe as their Sacred Maiden! They only choose beautiful girls. If it weren't for you, her birthmark would still be there, and she wouldn't have been chosen!"</p><p>"Sacred Maiden?"</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed slightly, realizing it wasn't a life-threatening situation. He had seen the Yi Hui Tribe on the Wu Chong Sect's topographical map. They were the dominant force in the Qian Hu region and beyond.  Their priests were cultivators, including a Foundation Establishment expert, even stronger than those at the Tian Yue Tribe.</p><p>Qin Sang's understanding of the Western Border's witch clans was limited, and he didn't know the meaning of 'Sacred Maiden.' It sounded like being chosen was a good thing.</p><p>But it couldn't be that simple!</p><p>Witch clans practiced necromancy, insect control, and spirit worship – some customs were extremely sinister.</p><p>"What do they make the Sacred Maidens do?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious as he asked in a low voice.</p><p>The old man shook his head weakly, tears welling in his eyes. "All I know is that the girls chosen as Sacred Maidens for the Yi Hui Tribe never return! That poor child, Ya Gu, has suffered so much…"</p><p>The old man collapsed to the ground. After listening to his story, Qin Sang finally understood.</p><p>Apparently, the Yi Hui Tribe had a custom: before the annual Witch God Festival, they selected pure, newly adult girls from the villages under their control to be their Sacred Maidens.</p><p>The Yi Hui Tribe touted the 'Sacred Maiden' title as an honor, claiming it brought the Witch God's blessing. But the villages weren't fools.  Since none of the Sacred Maidens ever returned after the festival, there was clearly a dark secret.</p><p>Firstly, the Yi Hui Tribe's priests were the Witch God's emissaries. Being ordinary people, they dared not resist.</p><p>Secondly, the Yi Hui Tribe didn't demand a maiden from the same village every year. Each village only had to contribute one every few years, making the brutal custom somewhat bearable, so they tacitly accepted it.</p><p>This year, it was Qian Hu Village's turn to offer a 'Sacred Maiden,' and Ya Gu was about to come of age.</p><p>The Yi Hui Tribe had beauty requirements for their Sacred Maidens. If Qin Sang hadn't cured her birthmark, Ya Gu might have escaped this fate.</p><p>"In Qian Hu Village, how is the 'Sacred Maiden' selected?"</p><p>Qin Sang's voice was icy as he questioned.</p><p>The old man gave a bitter laugh.  "Everyone was eager to get rid of Ya Gu, the 'unlucky one.'  They didn't need a selection process; some already wanted her dead."</p><p>"They all deserve to die!"</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, turning to look at Qian Hu Village outside the window.</p><p>A cold light flashed in his eyes, but he didn't act.  Interfering would be overstepping his bounds.</p><p>Ya Gu had survived her hardships, thanks to the help of her people.</p><p>Let her choose her own path.</p><p>(The next chapter will be delayed.)</p>
