Chapter 144 Cloud Beasts

Yu Daiyue was honest enough to reveal the details of the ancient cultivator遗址 (yí zhǐ) they had bought from the Tianhen Tower, with his Martial Sister Qingting.

“If Junior Martial Brother Qin agrees to break the formation with us, the treasures that Junior Martial Brother Qin finds, after entering the ancient cultivator遗址, belong to you, according to the common practice in the Immortal cultivation world. For the rest of the spoils we discover together, no matter what they are, we will distribute them according to the item’s worth. Martial Sister Qingting and I have the right to choose one item first, but we will definitely give a share to Junior Martial Brother Qin. Because we are all disciples of the same sect, it is better to clarify the rules at the beginning to avoid any misunderstanding.”

Qin Sang pondered after hearing this.

His Martial Sister Qingting and Yu Daiyue must’ve been searching for help within the sect, and the ancient cultivator 遗址 (yí zhǐ) could not be fake. Furthermore, the conditions they offered were pretty tempting. The two of them had spent Spirit Stones to buy the clues. They had also spent time looking for its location and inviting help, so it was only fair that they had priority in selecting the treasures.

Like the saying goes: If one’s strength is inferior to the opposition, self-preservation would be a problem when facing danger.

The Ten Directions Yama Formation was indeed very powerful. After Qin Sang broke through to the Foundation Establishment stage, the might it exuded reached another level. Before he learned the divine ability 《Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture》 (Yuán Shén Yǎng Jiàn Zhāng), it could be considered his strongest method to deal with enemies.

However, this formation required a certain amount of time to activate. Just looking at the strange shield and the restrictive formations around the ancient cultivator 遗址 (yí zhǐ) was enough to tell that this place was not simple. Who knew what kind of unknown dangers lurked inside? If they were suddenly attacked, there might not be enough time to set up the formation.

Before his strength improved, it was best not to rush into a dangerous place. The treasures within the ancient cultivator 遗址 (yí zhǐ) were enticing, but one had to live long enough to claim it.

In any case, Qin Sang was not familiar with Yu Daiyue. Having made up his mind not to go, he put on a bit of an act and was about to decline politely.

Yu Daiyue seemed to have guessed his thoughts and hurriedly said, “Junior Martial Brother Qin, don’t be in a hurry to decide. Martial Sister Qingting and I have only just gathered the required spiritual materials. Currently, Martial Sister Qingting is in retreat, refining the Formation Breaking Magic Tool. We can’t set off within the next short while. After the Formation Breaking Magic Tool has been refined, we will still need at least seven Foundation Establishment cultivators to fully activate it. I still haven’t found enough helpers. Junior Martial Brother Qin can go back and consider this matter. You can give me your reply later.”

…

After leaving Yu Daiyue’s cave, Qin Sang pondered for a moment and muttered, “Anyway, I do not need to make a decision right away. By the time it’s done, I do not know if I will be able to break through into the second level of cultivation technique. Once I’ve tested the utility of that divine ability, I will give it consideration.”

There were no shortage of ancient cultivator遗址 (yí zhǐ) that had appeared in the Cloudmist Swamp. The outcome really depended on luck.

There was a possibility it would be empty, or it could contain the relics of ancient cultivators, secret arts, magic weapons, or rare spiritual materials. It was very enticing.

If he cultivated the 《Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture》 (Yuán Shén Yǎng Jiàn Zhāng) to a higher level, he would inevitably have to enter dangerous places and search for spiritual wood to refine the Ebony Sword.

If his strength was truly inadequate, he would naturally refuse outright. But if the divine ability was powerful enough, he would at least consider trying. He would play it by ear.

His遁光 (dùn guāng) sped towards the sect leader’s peak in the blink of an eye.

Qin Sang landed quietly in front of the sect leader’s hall. He looked around and walked inside. A young disciple immediately greeted him.

“Greetings, Martial Uncle. Martial Uncle Sect Leader has gone out for business and will not return until tomorrow. May I ask what business you have? You may leave a message token. The disciple will give it to Martial Uncle Sect Leader once he returns.”

Qin Sang did not come to see the sect leader. Sect Leader Yu was not here, which saved him some trouble. He said, “Go and bring me all the piled-up matters of the sect leader’s peak from recent days. If there are any messages about妖灵期 (yāo líng qī)妖兽 (yāo shòu) appearing, and any information about the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, take them out and give me a copy.”

“Disciple obeys!”

The young disciple left to do his task. Not long after, he returned with a stack of jade slips.

Qin Sang took them and reviewed them one by one. He continued until the very last one before he found messages about two妖灵期 (yāo líng qī) beginning stage 妖兽 (yāo shòu). Furthermore, the situations seemed difficult to deal with. Both were in the depths of the Cloudmist Swamp. It would take more than half a month for him to fly there with his flying sword.

Let alone the fact that flying carelessly in the Cloudmist Swamp was not a good idea, there was no certainty that the妖兽 (yāo shòu) would still be there.

妖灵期 (yāo líng qī) beginning stage 妖兽 (yāo shòu) were not bad materials for weapon refinement. The sect would even offer rewards for killing them. Although Foundation Establishment cultivators would not be overly excited, those who wanted to kill them would long since have done so.

Qin Sang memorized the information on the jade slip. He took out the last jade slip containing information about the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.

In the Shadowmoon Sect, he had heard of the renowned Ancient Immortal Battlefield a long time ago. After arriving at Mount Shaohua, out of curiosity, he had gained some basic knowledge about it, but he did not have many details.

Allegedly, the world would have been inhabited by enormous spiritual power, resources were everywhere to be found, and cultivation was far easier than it is now. There were a lot of cultivators in the Divine Transformation and above phase, and there was even a legend that a great master in the Mahayana phase reached the celestial world. It was not like now, where the Nascent Soul Phase is the most advanced and the cultivation path is closed.

Later, for unknown reasons, the celestial immortals of ancient times suddenly started fighting.

Different stories exist in different legends. Some say that the numerous factions of immortals contended to inherit morality, some say a rare treasure emerged and caused a riot, and some say the invasion of evil spirits, which made the celestial immortals of ancient times sacrifice themselves to fight them in order to protect the lives in the world.

There is one exception, though: the words like country ruined, world collapse and creatures extinct were used, which shows the cruelty of the battle.

Allegedly, the vast and boundless world became broken after the battle, and over time, although life force gradually recovered, numerous factions of immortals vanished and classics were lost, the spiritual power also became extremely weak, which caused difficulties for cultivation.

Cultivators in the Minor Cold Prefecture assumed that the Ancient Immortal Battlefield is one of the ruins of the battle.

At the deepest point of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, there are still countless space rifts remaining, and only the battle of celestial immortals of ancient times could cause such terror and destructive power. It has been thousands of years yet it still cannot recover.

These space rifts are extremely dangerous, if a cultivator in the Core Formation Phase was careless, he/she would be swallowed by the space rift, and only death awaited. What is even more terrifying is that some space rifts can be discerned by naked eyes but some are well hidden, immaterial and formless, and even the spirit and consciousness cannot detect them. Cultivators in the Nascent Soul Phase also have to be extremely careful.

Therefore, although there are numerous historic sites of ancient times in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, nobody dares to explore it.

Based on Qin Sang’s ability, of course he dared not go deep into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, but the periphery of the battlefield was not peaceful either.

Legends say that too many celestial immortals of ancient times died and their bodies remained undecayed in the depth of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, even after their death they still had a will to fight, after years of evolution it turned into something like a baleful aura, The baleful aura transformed into a strange creature in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Cultivators in the Minor Cold Prefecture called them Cloud Beasts.

These Cloud Beasts don’t have any mind, and their appearances are very weird, they are extremely malicious towards all creatures and only know how to kill. Some are extremely powerful, they can resist high-ranking cultivators in the Golden Core Phase, and some are weaker than cultivators in the Qi Refining Phase, but there are numerous Cloud Beasts, and it seems they cannot be wiped out.

Once they rushed into the Minor Cold Prefecture, they would lead lives to perdition. It is not only ordinary people that they would annihilate, but also the cultivators would become extinct.
