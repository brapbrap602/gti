<h1>Chapter 1686: The Might of Six Birds</h1><p>Deploying six divine birds wasn't Qin Sang's first choice.</p><p>This was the first time all six birds were unleashed simultaneously. Qin Sang had no idea how powerful they would be, or what kind of spectacle it would create.  A Nascent Soul cultivator was directly overhead; the Five Elements Divine Banishment might not be able to conceal the fluctuations of the South Ming Li Fire.  But Qin Sang had no time to hesitate; it was a necessary risk.</p><p>Su Zinan's giant demonic spirit, formed by merging three Corpse God Banners, and the Soul-Burning Blood Sacrifice, presented a mortal threat to Qin Sang.  The Soul-Burning Blood Sacrifice, in particular, required three Yuan Ying late-stage demonic spirits to activate, and Su Zinan seemed to be straining considerably, indicating its immense power.</p><p>In this situation, Qin Sang didn't want to test the relative strengths of three divine birds and the Blood Mark. His avatar was in immediate danger; any hesitation could have catastrophic consequences. The safest option was to unleash all six solar birds to force Su Zinan back and rescue his avatar.</p><p>Since a price had to be paid, Qin Sang wasn't content with merely driving Su Zinan away. He aimed for a decisive victory, a permanent solution. Letting Su Zinan escape, only to become even more formidable once his three souls were reunited, was unacceptable.  This man was treacherous, having repeatedly made things difficult for him. Qin Sang lacked the confidence to kill him, and, having ascended the mountain for a Nascent Soul opportunity, he had a clear objective and didn't want to create complications, so he had endured until now.  The moment opportunity presented itself, Qin Sang would strike without hesitation, eliminating this villain.</p><p>Yue Fei's warning, and the recent rebuke from Crane Ridge Elder, indicated that Old Deer Demon hadn't been trapped in the Wuwang Hall like the Hui Guang Saint, but had ascended, leaving this realm.  Killing Su Zinan wouldn't risk retaliation from Old Deer Demon.</p><p>Lower realm matters stay in the lower realm.</p><p>When he himself ascended—if he ever did—he could consider Old Deer Demon's threat then.  According to Ghost Mother, the Great Thousand World was vast and boundless; encountering him again wouldn't be easy.</p><p>This was a crisis, but also an opportunity.  Just as when he'd first been able to control the Solar God Tree, controlling six divine birds gave Qin Sang almost no control; awakening them was the limit. Their power was unquestionable, but they lacked maneuverability. If the opponent didn't engage directly, it was easy to miss.  Especially an opponent like Su Zinan, a Nascent Soul successor with countless magical treasures and abilities, who employed two demonic spirits to attack while his main body remained mobile on the periphery—he was a truly formidable foe.</p><p>Su Zinan was wholeheartedly focused on seizing the Five Elements Pill, holding nothing back, merging his three souls to forcefully obstruct Qin Sang's rescue attempt, providing Qin Sang with his opening.</p><p>However, once six birds appeared on the Solar God Tree, anyone with half a brain would know that their power would be far greater than three. Su Zinan was certainly no fool.</p><p>The Five Elements Pill was ultimately an external object; if it was unattainable, Su Zinan wouldn't fight to the death for it.</p><p>At the critical moment, Qin Sang made a decisive move, awakening the Gu King in his dantian and forcing out the poisonous light to delay Su Zinan's reaction.</p><p>"Whoosh whoosh whoosh..."</p><p>The branches of the Solar God Tree were instantly mostly bare. The divine birds carved six trails of crimson flames across the void, the blazing fire illuminating the interior of the sword array in a brilliant, fiery red.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's strenuous guidance, the six paths of crimson flame converged, finally merging together in the void. The flames were blinding, the spiritual fire's aura incredibly violent—the birds were completely invisible, just a mass of crimson fire.</p><p>Qin Sang's true essence instantly depleted, and a wave of weakness swept over him. He gasped, feeling like he might suffocate.  His vision was filled with nothing but that mass of fire; his eyes reflected a look of astonishment.</p><p>The consumption of unleashing all six birds was far greater than he'd anticipated. He could barely manage to awaken them and trace the simplest, most direct path, launching them before his true essence was completely exhausted.</p><p>Afterwards, the South Ming Li Fire was completely beyond his control. Whatever was in front of it, even if he himself stood before the flames, would face the same fate.</p><p>The power was apparently not merely a simple addition of three more birds' power...</p><p>Su Zinan, who faced the flames directly, felt it most acutely.</p><p>The poisonous light did not disappoint Qin Sang. The toxin rampaged through the giant demonic spirit's body, shaking it.  While the three demonic spirits combined to suppress the poisonous light, they witnessed the Blood Mark being consumed by the mass of fire.</p><p>The imposing Blood Mark posed virtually no obstacle.</p><p>The blood that welled up from the bloody marks instantly evaporated in the intense flames, leaving behind no trace whatsoever, only raging fire.</p><p>The flames radiated an incredibly ferocious energy, beyond Su Zinan's comprehension.  He couldn't imagine what kind of fire possessed such power; how could someone at the late Yuan Ying stage possibly control such force?</p><p>The giant demon spirit's pupils dilated, its eyes burning crimson from the flames, reflecting Su Zinan's own terror and anxiety.  Its mouth gaped open, but as if its throat were constricted, it couldn't make a sound, its fear intensifying.  In an instant, the flames surged forward, closing in, threatening to melt the giant demon spirit.</p><p>At that moment, Su Zinan was consumed by regret.  If he hadn't been so obsessed with the Five Elements Pill, he wouldn't have clashed directly with Qin Sang. He could have used the two demon spirits as shields; even if Qin Sang revealed their trump cards, he could have retreated safely.  If he hadn't been affected by the Gu King's poisonous light, he would have had a chance to react when the six divine birds attacked.</p><p>Now, it was too late.</p><p>Within the sword array, the sword stars arranged themselves, their pure starlight transforming into a celestial expanse.  Deep within this starry sky, one sword star was stained with thick blood energy, the crimson light shooting towards the heavens, turning into an ominous blood star.  But neither starlight nor blood light could match the brilliance of the flames.</p><p>The giant demon spirit, standing before the flames, swayed, its legs trembling, attempting to retreat, but too late to dodge before being engulfed by the fire, following in the footsteps of the bloody marks.</p><p>Instantly, the vague outline of a fiery figure appeared within the flames.  The figure flailed its arms, resembling a death throe, its body shrinking rapidly until even its outline disappeared.</p><p>Having consumed the giant demon spirit, the flames continued their furious advance.  Like a blazing comet piercing the heavens, it burst into this starry expanse, unstoppable, plunging into the blood array formed by the Burning Soul Blood Sacrifice.</p><p>The blood array was operating at its peak.  Countless blood wraiths and ghastly creatures surged towards the sword star.  Reinforced layer upon layer, thick blood plasma pulsed on the surface of the blood bubble. Twisted, tormented heads emerged from the plasma, but due to their sheer density, they were pulled back down by other blood wraiths before they could fully surface, accompanied by heart-wrenching screams and howls, resembling the legendary Yellow Springs.  Anyone at the heart of the blood array could not escape the Burning Soul calamity.</p><p>‘Gurgling…’</p><p>Amidst the churning blood plasma, the sound of snapping strings could be faintly heard, as if the void itself were tearing apart.  This was actually the sound of the sword intent barrier collapsing under the assault of the blood array.  The starlight within the blood bubble was almost completely obscured.  This sword star was on the verge of destruction.  The avatar hidden within faced a life-or-death crisis.</p><p>Given a little more time, the blood array would have consumed the sword star, and Su Zinan might have achieved his goal, but that moment would never arrive.</p><p>The vanguard of the Southern Ming Li Fire charged into the blood array.  Observing its path, it was not heading for the center of the array; otherwise, it would be destroying the avatar instead of saving it.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Southern Ming Li Fire's presence stirred up colossal blood waves in the blood array.  Immediately, the blood array retaliated, forcing the blood waves back. The recoiling waves crashed against the flames.</p><p>Then, the blood waves evaporated upon contact with the flames.  The previously stable blood array was instantly torn open by the flames, allowing the raging torrent of fire to surge in, destroying everything in its path.</p><p>A blinding flash of crimson light illuminated the scene as runes shattered, countless blood wraiths annihilated. The blood array could no longer mount an effective defense, finally being pierced by the fiery torrent.</p><p>It was as if a destructive flood had swept through, a deafening roar echoing as a large void appeared in one side of the blood array, precisely where the flames had passed.  The formation was utterly destroyed!</p><p>The crimson light dimmed abruptly, other sections of the blood array disintegrating.  The blood light encircling the sword star burst like a true blood bubble.  The runes within the array dissipated, the blood wraiths vanishing without a trace.</p><p>Starlight pierced through the remaining plasma.  The sword star reappeared, though not as bright as before.  Within, an ethereal figure was seated in meditation, a square seal above its head, a divine serpent coiled around its body—Qin Sang's avatar.</p><p>The avatar opened its eyes, the shock still visible within them.</p><p>Su Zinan narrowly escaped being incinerated by the Nan Ming Li Fire.  The moment it passed him, he felt as if he and the blood array would be crushed instantly.</p><p>The obscuring blood bubbles dissipated, restoring his vision. Before he could assess his surroundings, he heard a scream.</p><p>The scream came from Su Zinan.</p><p>The instant the giant demonic soul was consumed by the Nan Ming Li Fire, Su Zinan, at any cost, forcibly used a reversal technique to pull himself back from his demonic soul state, narrowly avoiding sharing the same fate.</p><p>However, due to the poisonous light, he was a step too slow, losing his chance to escape unscathed.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Su Zinan's body suddenly burst into flames.</p><p>Returning to his physical form, Su Zinan's face contorted in agony, his piercing scream echoing. The flames pierced his body, burning from the inside out, instantly burning through his robes.</p><p>His naked body was exposed, half his body charred and nearly reduced to ash; faint, ethereal flames flickered, threatening to consume him entirely.</p><p>Clearly, while not instantly killed, Su Zinan was severely impacted by the Nan Ming Li Fire, suffering from the lingering effects of the flames.</p><p>Not only him, but the Three Corpse Death Banner beside him also showed signs of catching fire. However, because his two demonic souls were destroyed, the Nan Ming Li Fire didn't spread, although the banner was clearly altered.</p><p>The banner originally depicted three heads. After Su Zinan murdered Lao Wu and Yan Shan, it showed two figures and one head.</p><p>Now, the figures had vanished, leaving two red marks with spreading embers. Two holes burned through the banner, the faceless head remaining, but much blurrier and on the verge of disintegration.</p><p>Six birds emerged; souls perished, banner destroyed, array broken!</p><p>“Aaah…”</p><p>Su Zinan's physical body, primordial spirit, and soul were all ablaze, searing pain racking his entire being. Critically wounded, his life force rapidly ebbed. His scream was shrill, filled with immense grief and despair, bordering on madness.</p><p>He deeply regretted using the Five Elements Pill, ruining his promising future.</p><p>He intensely hated Qin Sang, his hatred burning fiercely.</p><p>But his reason remained intact. He was still alive; life meant hope. As long as he could fight for a chance, he could rise again and seek revenge.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A blue light suddenly erupted beneath Su Zinan’s feet, transforming into a small, round mirror.</p><p>The mirror's edge was transparent, almost crystalline, its surface rippling, seeming to connect to another place.</p><p>The mirror expanded, the blue light intensified, revealing a circular pattern about a zhang in diameter.  The interior was dark and wavy, deep like an ancient well, or a water gate.</p><p>This treasure was Yan Shan's Thousand Realms Mirror, which he had used to escape Qin Sang and take the water-attribute relic. After capturing Yan Shan, Su Zinan had seized it.</p><p>With the demonic souls in the banner, Yan Shan's everything was plundered by Su Zinan.</p><p>Including the Thousand Realms Mirror, which Su Zinan now intended to use. Fearing the Hui Guang Sage, he had made thorough preparations before acting, setting up the Thousand Realms Mirror elsewhere. The Five Elements Divine Prohibition was riddled with flaws and couldn't contain anyone anymore.</p><p>Once he obtained the elixir, he would immediately escape from Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>However, Su Zinan never anticipated escaping in this way, fueling his hatred even more.</p><p>The water rippled; Su Zinan grabbed the broken banner and leaped into the mirror.</p><p>A wave of white frost shot from the center of the blood array.</p><p>Instantly, the mirror's surface frosted over, the water freezing.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The mirror shattered.</p><p>Simultaneously, images of the mirror appeared on various mountain walls of Di Shou Mountain, creating a path of ice mirrors leading outside.  But as more mirrors appeared, faint figures materialized on their surfaces, followed by the sound of shattering.  With each mirror, the frost spread, shattering both the mirror and the phantom.</p><p>Until the last one shattered.</p><p>Within the sword array, the mirror lay in pieces, Su Zinan's figure reappearing.  His desperate eyes were reflected in the scattered fragments.</p><p>He knew that Yan Shan had used the Thousand Realms Mirror against Qin Sang, but even with precautions, it was difficult to counter once activated.  However, he never imagined that Qin Sang had received the legacy of a former Thousand Realms Mirror master in the North Sea, understanding its key weakness.  Qin Sang had directly used the Ice Soul Divine Light to cut off Su Zinan’s escape route.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Su Zinan transformed into a bloody light, still refusing to give up, burning half his body to perform the Blood Escape technique.</p><p>Suddenly, a giant serpent descended, its long tail lashing out, striking the bloody light.  A scream echoed, a gray shadow tumbling from the light, instantly frozen into an ice lump by the ensuing frost.</p><p>Although it seems complex, from the divine bird's attack to the avatar restraining the remaining infant soul, it all happened in a flash.</p><p>The torrent of Nan Ming Li Fire overwhelmed the blood array, continuing its relentless advance.  The flames became unbalanced, rapidly expanding into a giant fireball, countless flames erupting from it.</p><p>Like a great sun, dimming the stars.</p><p>Even more violent was the fireball's interior.  As the Nan Ming Li Fire fully erupted, cracks appeared around the flames.  The surrounding sword stars were driven by some force to block the flames, but the sword array's power couldn't suppress the Nan Ming Li Fire.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>From outside, the cloud of the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, the golden portion, suddenly became violent. A crack appeared in its center, and fiery red flames shot outwards.</p><p>The sword array, painstakingly constructed by the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, was torn apart by the Nan Ming Li Fire, shaking its very foundations!</p><p>Qin Sang, suppressing the poison, his face changing dramatically, suddenly looked up.  He saw the flying swords traversing the sky, the suspended lake tainted with demonic energy, and a pair of alluring eyes.</p><p>Seeing the flames shooting from the clouds, the eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
