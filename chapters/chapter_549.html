<h1>Chapter 542: Confinement</h1><p>Chapter 542: Confinement</p><p>Secondly, even if one finds both these extraordinary objects, who would dare to incorporate them into their body?</p><p>Both Earth Fiend Qi and Supreme Heaven Gang Qi are extremely violent and unruly objects, posing the greatest danger to cultivators; they are to be avoided like the plague.  Without the unique secret techniques and restrictions of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, during the step of drawing the Earth Fiend Qi into his body, Qin Sang's dantian would have been destroyed by the Earth Fiend Qi.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect considers the Qingyang Divine Gang the foundation of their sect, and they only use it to refine the seed of their inner Qingyang Demon Fire, never daring to let the Qingyang Divine Gang directly contact their flesh.</p><p>The simultaneous entry of Gang and Fiend Qi into the Qi Sea, allowing them to hone their spiritual energy through mutual conflict, is simply terrifying. If these two meet within the body and explode, the cultivator will undoubtedly perish.</p><p>Moreover, during the process of Gang and Fiend Qi impacting the dantian, Qin Sang did not notice any changes in his spiritual energy, indicating that condensing Fiend and refining Gang might not have an immediate effect like the Snow Spirit Lotus or Iris Flower.  It probably requires continuous refinement, grinding away the body's spiritual energy until the final effect manifests.  Even if someone were to suddenly go mad and attempt this, they certainly wouldn't persevere to the end.</p><p>Looking back at the entire corpse refinement experience, Qin Sang proceeded with each step cautiously, walking on eggshells. His success was due to: first, using five elemental Yin objects to build a foundation and strengthen his Qi Sea; then, relying on the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* to soothe the Earth Fiend Qi and refining an external Golden Core into his body, before daring to undertake the Gang and Fiend Qi impact on his dantian. During this impact, the Golden Core bore the brunt of the attack, allowing Qin Sang to survive. But even this Golden Core nearly couldn't withstand it. Had it been a Golden Core or妖丹 (yao dan - demon core) over ten years old, with significantly diminished spiritual essence, it would undoubtedly have ended in failure.</p><p>Of course, the jade Buddha played a crucial role!  The jade Buddha was the foundation for Qin Sang's daring experiments. Protected by the jade Buddha, Qin Sang dared to implant the Heavenly Corpse Talisman into his primordial spirit.  Otherwise, even if he were desperate in the future and did so, after completing the Gang and Fiend Qi impact on his dantian, the final outcome would likely still result in a corpse transformation. He would become like Wu Shang, a mindless flying night yaksha, confined to a frigid ice cave, eternally without release.</p><p>A combination of extremely harsh conditions, coincidences, and sheer luck, forged the Qin Sang of today.  This path is impossible for others to replicate. Even knowing the effects of Heavenly Gang and Earth Fiend Qi, finding alternative methods would be incredibly difficult, possibly harder than collecting auxiliary Golden Core refinement materials. After all, other False Core cultivators don't have Qin Sang's disastrously poor aptitude, and thus don’t need to take such desperate risks.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly sighed.  Wu Shang's letter did not lead him down the corpse path, yet it unexpectedly illuminated a new, unprecedented path to Golden Core formation. The Way has fifty elements, Heaven creates forty-nine, Heaven is ruthless, yet compassionate!</p><p>But looking back, how many trials of his mentality did he endure along the way?  If he had been discouraged after his failed attempt to reach Golden Core using the Snow Spirit Lotus and the Iris Flower, lacking the perseverance to seek a glimmer of hope from the impossible...</p><p>If he had been timid in the face of the difficulties and dangers of the corpse refinement techniques, lacking the determination to risk everything...</p><p>If, after refining the corpse core, he had become intoxicated by his power, content with his accomplishments, unwilling to remove the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, straying from the right path, failing to maintain his Dao heart in pursuit of the Way...</p><p>One wrong step, and he would have missed this opportunity. This was not merely a transformation of his cultivation, but also a baptism of his Dao heart!</p><p>…</p><p>Thinking of the jade Buddha, Qin Sang suddenly remembered that Shi Ying's soul imprint remained deep within his primordial spirit. On Divine Gang Peak, after stunning Shi Ying, Qin Sang did not immediately remove the soul imprint as a precaution, but it was no longer needed. He immediately had the jade Buddha shatter it. The jade Buddha easily pulverized it without leaving a trace, something even a Nascent Soul cultivator would find difficult to achieve.</p><p>"The Qingyang Demon Sect will certainly investigate how I infiltrated their sect. However, by the time I left the Qingyang Demon Sect and fought Wu Youdao, Shi Ying should have awakened. If she's clever, whether she escapes the Qingyang Demon Sect amidst the chaos or finds a way to conceal herself, escape shouldn't be difficult. Her future depends on her own destiny…"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, dismissing his thoughts. His karmic connection with Shi Ying ended there; they were even, and he wouldn't go back to meddle in her affairs.</p><p>…</p><p>After the initial excitement, Qin Sang’s mind returned to calm. Realizing that he still couldn't guarantee complete success, he hurriedly settled his mind, patiently running his cultivation technique to strengthen the spiritual energy in his Qi Sea.</p><p>Time slipped away silently.</p><p>When the spiritual energy in the two mid-grade spirit stones in his hand was almost depleted, turning them into pale white stones, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, his eyes flashing with brilliance.  That trace of spiritual energy was countless times stronger than before.</p><p>Now, his spiritual energy was incredibly condensed. This was a qualitative change. Even without forming a Golden Core, his strength was far superior to what it was before.</p><p>To measure it, his strength would be somewhere between a False Core cultivator and a Flying Night Fiend, provided his spiritual energy could maintain this state.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush to attempt forming a Golden Core. He stopped when his spiritual energy recovered to about 70-80%, because he hadn't yet mastered the Corpse Pill.</p><p>The longer he delayed, the harder it would be to subdue the Corpse Pill, and its instability grew increasingly apparent.  He couldn't afford to delay any longer.  Even if he did form a Golden Core, this 'external pill' would be a powerful aid, equivalent to having two Golden Cores—he had spent countless efforts refining it, and Qin Sang naturally didn't want to waste it.</p><p>Of course, compared to the Corpse Pill, his own Golden Core was more important. If the Corpse Pill were to hinder his Golden Core formation, he would undoubtedly discard it without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently observed for a while. Seeing that his spiritual energy was very stable and showed no signs of reverting, he felt relieved and focused on the Corpse Pill's state.</p><p>He had originally planned to actively dissipate some of the Corpse Pill's power to make it easier to control. Now that his inner energy had undergone a transformation and his strength had soared, there was no need for such extra steps. He could directly attempt to control the Corpse Pill at its full strength.</p><p>Qin Sang had a plan in mind. He immediately exerted all his spiritual energy, enveloping the Corpse Pill.</p><p>The Corpse Pill didn't resist Qin Sang; he didn't have to fear any backlash, and he could act freely.</p><p>This 'subjugation' was a slow process.  It took a full hour before Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state, letting out a long breath in excitement.</p><p>After repeated attempts, he finally subdued the Corpse Pill. His True Essence didn't feel stagnant; he regained complete control.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had absorbed his True Essence into the Corpse Pill.  The bluish-black Corpse Pill slowly rotated in Qin Sang's dantian, with faint glows of restrictions appearing on its surface.</p><p>Whenever Qin Sang wished, he could unleash the Corpse Pill, exhibiting a strength comparable to a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>He tested it out and it operated as smoothly as before, and it didn't affect his use of the "Soul Cultivation Sword Chapter" technique. His current strength was even greater than when he fought Wu Youdao!</p>
