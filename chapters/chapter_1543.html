<h1>Chapter 1534: The Worm King (4k)</h1><p>He had seen many venomous insects, but this was the first time he'd witnessed such unusual behavior from a fat silkworm.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly fell silent, gazing outside the cave.</p><p>Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu, unsure of what was happening, dared not disturb her.</p><p>Outside the cave,</p><p>a cloud of insects approached.</p><p>A buzzing sound, pervasive and inescapable, whether from the phosphorescent insects' cries or the beating of their wings, was clearly audible even inside the cave, causing anxiety and unrest.</p><p>The incessant buzzing made Zhou and Ruan realize they were surrounded by countless insects.  They involuntarily recalled the gruesome image of being devoured by insects, a tingling sensation seemingly rising from their bone marrow, spreading throughout their bodies, causing them to tremble, too afraid to even breathe.</p><p>The poisonous cloud was blocked by the fat silkworm.</p><p>The swarm didn't sense their presence.</p><p>Zhou and Ruan thought they had escaped.</p><p>Suddenly, the insects' sounds changed, making their hearts jump and almost causing them to cry out.</p><p>‘Buzz… buzz…’</p><p>The sound became abruptly faster, like the screeching of metal, sharp and piercing.</p><p>Moreover, the swarm seemed to have stopped above them; the sound was right beside their ears, lingering incessantly.</p><p>Zhou and Ruan's faces turned pale.</p><p>Qin Sang listened to the increasingly chaotic sounds, sensing the situation outside.  “The two clouds of insects aren't from the same group; they're fighting, and they've chosen this place as their battlefield.  The Sky Crack Valley is so large, there's no shortage of territory, yet they fight amongst themselves. Is it their inherent bloodlust, or is this a growth process for these spiritual insects…?”</p><p>The fat silkworm squirmed in Qin Sang's hand, eager to go outside.</p><p>Something inside the insect cloud had captured its interest.</p><p>Qin Sang remained cautious.</p><p>In the air,</p><p>the two insect clouds collided. To the outsider, they seemed indistinguishable.</p><p>The yellow poisonous cloud billowed, pressing down on the sky, containing countless frenzied beasts surging towards the center in a wild frenzy, pouring in from all directions.</p><p>Within the poisonous cloud, faint yellow lights flickered, gathering together. Each light was a phosphorescent insect; the lights were wavering, seeming insubstantial and weak, like ghost fires.</p><p>No wonder local cultivators called them ghost insects.</p><p>The insects' battle cries sounded like the roar of the poisonous cloud.</p><p>Above and below, the poisonous cloud was everywhere, accumulating layer upon layer, becoming denser and more oppressive.</p><p>Where the poisonous cloud covered, all life ceased.</p><p>The plants remained, and the birds and beasts showed no external wounds, but they had been corroded by the poisonous cloud; their life force had been completely drained from within, turning to dust with a gust of wind.</p><p>The insects' shriek initially exploded at a rapid pace, reaching a peak before entering a stalemate, then gradually weakening, indicating a winner had emerged, the loser likely to be devoured.</p><p>Finally, the shriek subsided, the battle drawing to a close.</p><p>Yet, the size of the poisonous cloud didn't diminish.</p><p>The swarm began to move, to continue plundering elsewhere, the poisonous cloud drifting away rapidly.</p><p>Qin Sang then suddenly moved, darting out of the cave and appearing on the mountaintop.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there was only desolate ruin.</p><p>Qin Sang stared in the direction the insect cloud had gone. The thing the fat silkworm sensed was indeed within the cloud. He wondered if the swarm's bloodlust was due to a struggle over something.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang pursued the ghost insect cloud, usually feared by others, quickly approaching the poisonous cloud.</p><p>The yellow poisonous cloud looked like a sandstorm.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the fat silkworm to put on his anti-venom armor, suppressing his aura and blending into the poisonous cloud.</p><p>The fat silkworm swayed its chubby body on Qin Sang's shoulder, expressing its excitement.  This usually happened when it discovered delicious food.</p><p>The anti-venom armor blocked the poisonous cloud, rendering it harmless to Qin Sang.</p><p>Through the thick poisonous cloud, the Tianmu butterfly could already see the surging insect swarm. Countless phosphorescent insects, all identical, resembled a river of lights.</p><p>There was nothing else but the phosphorescent insects.</p><p>Following the fat silkworm's sensing, Qin Sang looked at the target—only a dense mass of phosphorescent insects. Could it be inside one of them?</p><p>At that moment, the flowing swarm suddenly stopped, emitting the familiar shriek.</p><p>Qin Sang felt an indescribable pressure, his heart sinking as he realized he had been detected.</p><p>At this moment, the fat silkworm had locked onto a single phosphorescent insect.</p><p>This insect was no different from the others; Qin Sang was still puzzled, unclear what made it special and attracted the fat silkworm.</p><p>However, this didn't affect his actions.</p><p>Qin Sang no longer concealed himself, decisively launching a forceful attack.</p><p>A figure, swift as lightning, instantly reached the swarm.  He raised the Golden Sink Sword, and a devastatingly sharp burst of energy sliced through the insects.  The sword-energy pierced the swarm like an ice blade through flames, causing a ripple of illusory fire.</p><p>The dying Phosphorescent Fireflies, cut down by the Golden Sink Sword, shone with a breathtaking final light.  The sword continued its unstoppable advance, carving a path through the insects, straight towards a particular Firely.</p><p>The swarm seemed to react then, their furious cries deafening, filling Qin Sang's ears.  Undeterred, Qin Sang seized the opportunity, pushing into the swarm and effortlessly capturing the special Firefly.</p><p>Before he could examine it, the Fat Silkworm launched itself onto his finger, as if fearing someone would steal it, and gobbled it down, then rolled over contentedly.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected this Firefly might be the swarm's queen, explaining the Silkworm's attraction. If so, it was remarkably easy.</p><p>That thought barely crossed his mind when he sensed something was wrong with the swarm.  Suddenly, silence. The cries ceased.</p><p>A bizarre change swept over the insects. Before, the Fireflies had acted as one, sharing a common goal, perhaps even a shared fate. Qin Sang could clearly sense them as individuals.  But now, it was different.  They had merged into a single entity.</p><p>Qin Sang felt he faced not a swarm of insects, but a colossal monster. Each Firefly acted as a node in the monster's mind, woven into a seamless net.  The swarm had become a single, unified being.  This monster surrounded Qin Sang, eyes fixed on him with predatory hunger.</p><p>He felt a distinct emotion emanating from the swarm: a voracious greed.  Despite the individual Fireflies' weakness, they'd formed a massive, fiery creature posing a genuine threat – a threat that went beyond mere poison.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, glancing at the now-rigid Fat Silkworm. The swarm’s target was clear: the Silkworm!</p><p>The Silkworm's earlier arrogance vanished, replaced by terror. It huddled into Qin Sang's fingers, the hunter now hunted. The swarm stirred.</p><p>Unfazed, Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, unleashing infernal fire that instantly created a ring of flames around him. The smell of the fire – one of the world's most powerful spiritual flames – filled the air.</p><p>The swarm agitated, Qin Sang sensing fear and hesitation. The swarm could think, but its simplicity allowed its emotions to show.  This wasn't enough to deter them, though.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, drawing upon the Sun God Tree, releasing a wisp of South Ming Li Fire.  As expected, the faint ghost fires within the swarm flickered wildly. All the Fireflies beat their wings, their cries echoing across the land once more.</p><p>This time, the sound wasn’t shrill, but chaotically confused.  Qin Sang frowned, unable to decipher their intentions. He prepared to leave, avoiding a pointless fight, when the Fat Silkworm peeked from his fingers, its head bobbing excitedly, chattering frantically at the swarm.</p><p>"Are they communicating?"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the Silkworm's sly expression. The calls lacked clear meaning; the communication wasn't through sound but perhaps a direct mental link.  He remained silent, observing the swarm through his Tianmu butterfly.</p><p>His gaze swept over each Firefly, finally fixing on one hidden within the swarm – more elusive, almost ethereal, yet seemingly the center of the whole.</p><p>"There is a queen!"</p><p>Qin Sang understood. The swarm had produced a true queen, explaining its transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, his mind racing. He stealthily observed the queen's movements, waiting for his moment.</p><p>Without warning, a magical fire erupted!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The fiery dragon plunged into the swarm.  A jarring black patch appeared in the insect cloud, as if something had brutally ripped out a chunk of flesh. The buzzing intensified, now laced with pain.</p><p>Qin Sang moved with the flames.  When he moved, it was like a thunderbolt!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The fire’s momentum unabated, instantly consuming a large section of the phosphorescent insects.  Then, a blinding sword light flared at the fire dragon's head.  The Golden Sinking Sword shot forth, instantly forming a sword array.</p><p>Sensing danger, the phosphorescent insect king shimmered, attempting to become intangible. But it was too late. Before it could escape, the surrounding space darkened, trapped within the sword array.</p><p>*Chirp chirp…*</p><p>Fei Can, delighted at Qin Sang's success, squeaked and wiggled.</p><p>But Qin Sang showed little joy. The swarm hadn't reacted to their king's capture; their buzzing remained unchanged.</p><p>He stared at the insect king within the array.</p><p>The next moment, the insect king underwent a transformation.  Forced to reveal itself, its aura changed, becoming indistinguishable from an ordinary phosphorescent insect.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned.</p><p>Fei Can’s joyful chirps ceased, replaced by an expression of disbelief.</p><p>“The insect king can freely inhabit the bodies of its kind. Or rather, the insect king isn't within the swarm; it's hidden elsewhere, controlling them…”</p><p>Confirming that the phosphorescent insect showed no anomalies, Qin Sang considered the possibilities. He ordered the sky-eye butterfly to search again, discovering another phosphorescent insect undergoing the same transformation, becoming the new 'king'.</p><p>At that moment, the swarm’s buzzing became frantic, like an urgent threat.</p><p>Fei Can was startled, screaming in frustration, yet refusing to leave, its gaze fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed his spiritual sense and sky-eye ability to their limits, but couldn't locate the true king. He tried again, this time more precisely.  He used the fire, the sword array, even the soul-seizing incantation, perfectly coordinated.</p><p>The ‘insect king’ had nowhere to escape and was captured.</p><p>But the same thing happened again.  Before Qin Sang's very eyes, the ‘king’s’ aura vanished without a trace.  Though Qin Sang maintained his spiritual lock, he could not sense its origin. Simultaneously, a new ‘insect king’ appeared in the swarm.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head at Fei Can.  Only exterminating the swarm might reveal the king, but Fei Can wouldn't allow that.  He also wasn’t sure why the swarm was so eager to trade with Fei Can; they hadn’t launched a real attack, and their strange powers were unknown.  Furthermore, if the king was controlling the swarm from afar, even the Sun God Tree wouldn't likely find it.</p><p>He suspected the earlier clash between the two insect clouds was orchestrated by the true king.</p><p>Fei Can looked disappointed and mournful.</p><p>Then, Fei Can turned towards the swarm and cried out.  Its head lifted, body stretching nearly double its size. It groaned, a sound tinged with pain, slowly expelling a seven-colored aura.  It resembled the multicolored glow of the anti-venom armor, but denser, seeming to be Fei Can's very essence.</p><p>After releasing the aura, Fei Can was noticeably weaker, listlessly pushing forward a crystal, suspending it in the air.</p><p>The buzzing paused.  The swarm shifted, and the ‘insect king’ emerged, approaching the seven-colored aura.</p><p>Fei Can bared its teeth, issuing a warning.</p><p>The ‘insect king’ stopped, facing Qin Sang and Fei Can. Its fiery body swelled to the size of a fist. Then, a crack appeared, releasing a bright yellow crystal which it flung towards Fei Can before lunging at the seven-colored aura.</p><p>The crystal was translucent, like amber.</p><p>Qin Sang had never seen such an amber insect crystal.</p><p>The amber crystal seemed to appear out of thin air, the entire process unfolding before them, yet Qin Sang couldn’t sense its origin.</p><p>“I’ve just witnessed a trade between spirit insects.”</p><p>Despite his travels and vast experience, Qin Sang had never seen anything like this.  It was utterly amazing.</p><p>The world is vast and wondrous!</p><p>Seeing the crystal, Fei Can perked up, eyes gleaming. It snatched the crystal, ecstatic.  The ungrateful creature immediately reneged, shrieking, seemingly urging Qin Sang to retrieve the seven-colored aura.</p><p>And Qin Sang did.</p><p>The sword array didn't miss, easily sealing the ‘insect king’.  But the familiar scene repeated itself.  All the ‘insect king’s’ unique traits vanished; it reverted to an ordinary phosphorescent insect.  The seven-colored aura vanished as well, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The swarm’s momentum ebbed, returning to its previous ghostly form. Ignoring Qin Sang and the furious Fei Can, it swiftly retreated into the depths of the Rift Valley.</p>
