<h1>Chapter 1270: The Spoils of War</h1><p>The Demon Lord Ye, having personally refined the treasure banner, shared a deep connection with it. He understood the grand formation far better than Jiang Chenzi and the others who merely held the banners. After retrieving the jade bone, he took charge of the formation himself, and the power of the Banner Gate Formation surged, finally breaking free from the entanglement of the Dual Nine Palaces Formation.</p><p>Xiang Qing and his allies had held out for so long, which was no small feat. Everyone had generously contributed, bringing out various rare treasures to tightly bind the Banner Gate Formation. But now, they were nearing their limits. Among the four who wielded spirit talismans, only Xiang Qing, with his profound demonic cultivation, was in slightly better shape. Chongyi Daoist and his two disciples had already consumed several rounds of elixirs.</p><p>As their strength waned and the enemy's grew, they could no longer maintain the formation. They had no choice but to let Demon Lord Ye lead the Banner Gate Formation toward the Blood Pool to rescue Elder Tianzheng. They quickly gathered the remaining power of their formation and followed closely behind, determined to intercept Qin Sang and the others, lest Demon Lord Ye unleash a sudden, deadly strike.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>...</p><p>A series of dull thuds echoed as the Banner Gate Formation unleashed a storm of blood-red light. Despite the formidable power of the Ebony Sword and the Five Directions Pagoda, they were no match for the combined force and were sent flying. The Star Giant dissipated, revealing Elder Tianzheng, pale and weak, with several bloodstains marking where the Star Giant had been injured. Without looking back, Elder Tianzheng plunged into the Banner Gate Formation.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Ebony Sword surged forward again, aiming straight for Elder Tianzheng's back. But several beams of treasure light shot out from the Banner Gate Formation, forcing the sword to retreat.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly cursed his luck. Demon Lord Ye was simply too fast. Despite their full efforts, they had failed to kill Elder Tianzheng. The elder had transformed into the Star Giant, his body becoming ethereal starlight, rendering him nearly immortal. Many of their attacks had no effect on him. The injuries he sustained would only manifest on his true body once the secret technique faded.</p><p>The demon banner had been scattered by the aftermath of the Blood Demon's self-destruction, leaving no time to reorganize the formation. Otherwise, they might have had a chance!</p><p>With Elder Tianzheng rescued, the Banner Gate Formation turned and charged outward. Having obtained the jade bone, Demon Lord Ye and his allies had achieved their goal and showed no hesitation in retreating.</p><p>"Today, thanks to all of you, I, Ye, will remember this. I will repay you in kind!" Demon Lord Ye's icy voice carried a murderous intent.</p><p>At the same time, the curses of Jiang Chenzi and the others echoed. They had been in such a favorable position, yet something had gone wrong, leading to Demon Lord Ye's self-destruction of his avatar and Elder Tianzheng's severe injuries. It would likely take over a decade of recuperation for the elder to regain his full strength. How could they not be furious?</p><p>Although they had seized the jade bone, it was now devoid of any vitality, which only added to their anger. It seemed all their carefully laid plans might come to nothing. This battle had been a costly one, potentially even altering the course of the war across the three realms!</p><p>Qing Jun and the others were not far behind, flying into the Dual Nine Palaces Formation. Qin Sang's gaze met Jingyu's, and seeing her slight nod, he felt a surge of joy. Though they had missed out on the ancient cultivator's jade bone, obtaining the Corpse Flower Blood Amber was still a significant gain.</p><p>"Thank you for your hard work, fellow Daoists," Xiang Qing said as he opened the Nine Palaces to welcome them in. His face could not hide his exhaustion.</p><p>Chongyi Daoist and his two disciples had barely managed to control the jade talismans. The burden of maintaining the formation, evolving its patterns, and countering the enemy's attacks had fallen largely on Xiang Qing, draining him immensely.</p><p>"It's a pity the jade bone fell into Demon Lord Ye's hands. Who knows what they might decipher from it," Chongyi Daoist lamented, his face filled with regret.</p><p>His heavenly tribulation was approaching, and he knew he lacked the strength to overcome it. He had already resigned himself to his fate, content with having trained two Nascent Soul disciples. He could face his ancestors with a smile. But upon hearing of the ancient cultivator, a glimmer of hope had reignited his fighting spirit. He had pushed himself and his disciples to the limit, consuming elixirs to maintain the Dual Nine Palaces Formation, only to see it all vanish like a dream.</p><p>Tongyou Demon Lord also felt a pang of regret but refrained from voicing it. The four who had infiltrated the Blood Pool had been under his leadership. Yet, during the battle for the jade bone, he had been firmly blocked by Elder Tianzheng. The elder was a peerless expert, and no one could blame him. But compared to Qin Sang, who had forced the Blood Demon's avatar to self-destruct, and Qing Jun, who had faced Demon Lord Ye head-on, Tongyou Demon Lord felt overshadowed and humiliated.</p><p>"Each generation has its own talents..." Tongyou Demon Lord mused, glancing at Qing Jun and Qin Sang.</p><p>He had known Qing Jun for over two hundred years. Back then, she had disguised herself as Leng Yuntian, and though her ruse was eventually uncovered, she had somehow forced Red-Haired Ancestor to acquiesce, achieving her current status. There was a logic to her rise. But Qin Sang was a different story.</p><p>Just a few decades ago, he had been at the Golden Core stage. Now, even Tongyou Demon Lord had to retreat in the face of his demonic flames. It was astonishing. Throughout the history of the Northern Dipper Realm, few could claim such a feat.</p><p>"East Sun Elder, ha!" Tongyou Demon Lord couldn't help but recall the scene at the Cangheng Island meeting. Though he didn't know the full details, he could guess some of it. East Sun Elder, for all his cunning, had driven such a talent out of his sect. Truly, he had been blind.</p><p>"Continue the pursuit!" Qing Jun took the jade talisman from Si Di and resumed control of the formation, her voice firm.</p><p>Everyone nodded. Demon Lord Ye had lost his avatar and would surely suffer from the backlash, weakening him. Elder Tianzheng was almost completely incapacitated. They still had a chance!</p><p>As for the treasures here, the Sin Abyss faction was no longer in a position to compete. There would be plenty of time to explore later.</p><p>"Ming... uh... should I call you Daoist Mingyue or Daoist Qin?" Chongyi Daoist, recovering from his melancholy, handed the jade talisman to Qin Sang, his tone complex.</p><p>"I am Qin Sang. Previously, I had no choice but to use a secret technique to disguise myself as a demon. If I have offended anyone, I hope you can forgive me," Qin Sang said, feeling the subtle gazes of scrutiny and observation.</p><p>As he activated the jade talisman, coordinating with his senior sister to drive the formation in pursuit, he cupped his hands and addressed the group with composure.</p><p>"Not at all! Not at all!"</p><p>"Your methods are impressive, Daoist. Your disguise was flawless. I truly thought you were a demon king!"</p><p>"Though Daoist Qin aligned with the demons, he never shrank from his duties. He personally defended the front lines and achieved great merits multiple times. If anyone dares to speak ill of him, I won't let it stand!"</p><p>"With Daoist Tongyou, Daoist Leng, and Daoist Qin at our side, how can we not destroy the Sin Abyss?"</p><p>"Our Little Cold Domain is destined for greatness!"</p><p>...</p><p>The group responded warmly, returning his courtesy with polite smiles. The thought of Little Cold Domain gaining another formidable ally filled them with excitement and joy. The Northern Dipper Realm was unstable, and the fate of Little Cold Domain was tied to its strength.</p><p>Other matters could wait.</p><p>Xiang Qing, however, shook his head with a wry smile. "Daoist Qin, you deceived me thoroughly."</p><p>Qin Sang quickly apologized, and the two shared a knowing smile.</p><p>As for East Sun Elder and Shaohua Mountain, no one present brought them up.</p><p>Qing Jun, Tongyou Demon Lord, Xiang Qing, and Qin Sang each held a jade talisman, with Qing Jun leading the formation. They pursued the Sin Abyss faction relentlessly, occasionally clashing as they chased them out of the Blood Pool. Demon Lord Ye was focused solely on escape and refused to engage.</p><p>Before long, they reached the Blood Gate and followed Demon Lord Ye as he broke through it. To their astonishment, they discovered that a great change had occurred outside the Blood Gate!</p>
