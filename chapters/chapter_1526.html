<h1>Chapter 1517: The Northern Star Duo (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1517: The Northern Star Duo (4k)</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Qin Sang now knew who the ‘old acquaintance’ was: the top disciple of the Hunmo Elder.  He’d later learned that this person was among those who escaped the stone tablet space.  Tong Lingyu had personally sent the Hunmo Elder back to the stone tablet space, yet his spirit unexpectedly appeared outside.  Even with Qin Sang’s intelligence, he could guess what happened—a deeply touching master-disciple drama, no doubt.  A worthy disciple trained by the Hunmo Elder, indeed, displaying superior skills.</p><p>It was unclear what the top disciple had done to the Hunmo Elder, but his current state was pitiful.  The disciple’s intentions were obvious in delivering the Hunmo Elder’s spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently, acknowledging the favor. If the Hunmo Elder were to escape, once Qin Sang left the North Sea, the old demon would certainly take his revenge on the Qingyang Temple, unleashing a furious attack. He’d originally planned to speak with the disciple.</p><p>While at the Jinghai Sect, Qin Sang had noticed that the Hunmo Elder seemed unusually knowledgeable about the Jinghai Sect, perhaps possessing some hidden information. Since the Hunmo Elder's spirit was here, there was no need to seek out his disciple.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the tear-like spirit, a chilling aura emanating from it. After observing it for a while, he discovered the Hunmo Elder's consciousness was on the verge of collapse, requiring immediate soul-searching.</p><p>After sending off his visitor, Qin Sang sealed his cave dwelling, making numerous preparations to perform the soul-searching technique. Even with such thorough preparations, Qin Sang only obtained fragmented memories. The higher the opponent's cultivation, the less effective the soul-searching technique.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder’s soul scattered in agony, marking the end of a generation of formidable demonic cultivator!  Qin Sang lowered his head, watching the dissipating soul mist from his fingertips, recalling the Hunmo Elder’s power at the Jinghai Sect, and then looking at his current state—a poignant contrast.</p><p>The soul-searching revealed that the Hunmo Elder's knowledge of the Jinghai Sect was all common knowledge. The Jinghai Sect, though a hidden Buddhist sect, wasn't entirely isolated from the outside world.</p><p>The individual truly connected to the Jinghai Sect was the island master of Nine Precepts Island, the True Person of Keeping Precepts! This person had actually obtained the Jinghai Sect's heritage and was possibly the only surviving successor.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his experiences in the sacred land, remembering seeing the True Person of Keeping Precepts in the stone tablet space.  He was almost certainly suppressed at the bottom of the tower.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang got up, went to the other side of the cave dwelling, and activated a restriction.  A moment later, the cave dwelling silently opened, revealing Liuli in simple white clothing, standing gracefully but with an intensely cold aura that repelled others.  Most people would feel a chill as if entering winter under her gaze.</p><p>Qin Sang, accustomed to Liuli's personality, entered and said, “I plan to go to the Boundless Sea to search for a suitable island for a sect mountain, and I'll also return to the Northern Star Region. I’d like to borrow the Ten Directions Earth-Opening Shuttle again, to bring some disciples over.”</p><p>Liuli, without a word, extended her hand, a green light flashed, and the shuttle appeared in Qin Sang’s hand.</p><p>After a moment’s thought, Liuli said, “The Xuan Tian Palace still has records of that path, but only the initial segment remains.”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed, “I’ve already obtained relevant texts from Palace Master Tong.  I’m borrowing your shuttle to find the path thoroughly.”</p><p>The path to the Northern Star Region began at the place where Tian Yue Shangren erected his sword. Qin Sang intended to find the route and connect the two regions, but he wouldn't make it public.</p><p>Liuli nodded, saying nothing more.</p><p>After a slight hesitation, Qin Sang asked, “When are you planning to break through your bottleneck, Immortal?”</p><p>Liuli didn't answer, frowning at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade slip and handed it to Liuli, “Immortal, look at the contents. It’s a record left by Senior Xiao Xiangzi.”</p><p>While Liuli examined the jade slip, Qin Sang continued, “With Senior Xiao Xiangzi's discernment, he wouldn’t be wrong.  After one person comprehends the Buddhist bone relic, its power doesn't disappear immediately; a second person can still obtain significant benefits. Moreover, the Central Plains is where the spiritual energy of this world converges; it should help us solve many mysteries, such as what's beyond the storm belt, the origins of the Ziwei Palace, and… where people ascend to!”</p><p>After withdrawing her divine sense from the jade slip, a rare change appeared on Liuli's expression, her eyes filled with urgency and hope, "You want to…"</p><p>“My return is to settle unfinished business, so I can set off as soon as possible,” Qin Sang looked at the shuttle in his hand, “The journey to the Central Plains is long and dangerous, and I need your shuttle. However, I’m sure you won’t trade this treasure, so I can only invite you to travel with me.” He had specially borrowed the shuttle earlier, confirming its great value.</p><p>Liuli, almost without hesitation, held the jade slip tightly, “Give me eight years!”</p><p>“Eight years?”</p><p>Qin Sang calculated, realizing that this was precisely the time of Liuli’s first heavenly tribulation.  It seemed she planned to break through after the tribulation, and her tone suggested confidence.</p><p>It's true, if not for the cursed mark, Liuli would have surely broken through last time.  The Tranquility Incense can stabilize the mind and suppress inner demons, and with the Eight-winged Golden Cicada Molt, there's a good chance of success.</p><p>Eight years is worth the wait. Heavenly Tribulations are no child's play. If the tribulation is drawn in the storm zone, Qin Sang will also suffer.  Furthermore, he needs time to settle karmic debts and establish Qingyang Temple.</p><p>"Agreed!"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, about to leave.  Liuli, remembering something, took out two pouches and gave them to Qin Sang.</p><p>The pouches were made from the hide of a special spirit beast, specifically for storing Kan Shen Pearls.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, "Two?"</p><p>To his knowledge, the Xuan Tian Palace's sacred grounds only produced three at a time.  Qin Sang had already decided to have his clone cultivate other techniques; the Kan Shen Pearls weren't as important anymore.</p><p>Liuli said, "Master Jiang heard you needed Kan Shen Pearls and specially exchanged one to send over."</p><p>Jiang, the Grand Elder, owes his position partly to Qin Sang's influence.</p><p>"There's no need for this."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and shook his head, but didn't refuse, storing them in his Qianjun Ring, and then left.</p><p>Leaving Listening Snow Tower, Qin Sang headed southwest, planning to explore the Boundless Sea thoroughly. His primary goal was Nine Rings Island, passing a pre-selected location for a sect base along the way.</p><p>He flew continuously, the Boundless Sea in sight.</p><p>Before leaving Yin Ri Realm, Qin Sang subconsciously looked back towards Lingxiao Peak.</p><p>Not long ago, he and Tong Lingyu had broken into Yin Changsheng's cave. Yin Changsheng's abilities were unparalleled; his belongings certainly held great value. However, Qin Sang and Tong Lingyu were most interested in Yin Changsheng's tribulation-avoidance and breakthrough techniques.</p><p>Related to transformation and heavenly tribulations, even if they were evil arts, they held some value for study.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither technique was found. Based on limited information, after discussing with Tong Lingyu, Qin Sang felt the ice coffin was even more important; it was likely the key to Yin Changsheng's ability to delay heavenly tribulations.  However, it was severely damaged and its power was lost. Qin Sang currently didn't have time to focus on studying and restoring this treasure.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A green light shot out from Yin Ri Realm – Qin Sang, piloting the Ten Directions Earth-splitting Shuttle. The shuttle had a wind shield for protection, the interior was exceptionally stable, and the spirit energy consumption was significantly lower than similar artifacts.</p><p>Qin Sang enjoyed his flight over the sea, stopping only upon reaching his first destination.</p><p>Looking down from above, he surveyed the island, shaped like a turtle. The island was rich in spiritual energy.  Its master died at the sacred grounds; seizing the island would be effortless.</p><p>The problem was that, while there were many smaller islands nearby, their spiritual energy was pitifully thin and they were not far from Xuan Tian Palace.  If Qingyang Temple truly prospered one day, being so close to Xuan Tian Palace might not be a good thing.</p><p>Quickly dismissing this location, Qin Sang continued on his journey.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang found the Boundless Sea even more chaotic than before; filled with battles.  Golden Core cultivators held far greater power than before, becoming the main force in the fighting; even late Golden Core cultivators dared to call themselves ancestors.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Exquisite Pagoda; this single act completely changed the Boundless Sea's landscape, ushering in a complete reshuffling.</p><p>The internal strife wasn't limited to forces within the Boundless Sea.  The reorganized Xuan Tian Palace, the northern demon tribes, and the forces from the Xinyue Realm, all extended their influence here.</p><p>The secret clashes were even more dangerous.  Perhaps the chaotic, demon-ridden state of the Boundless Sea would become a thing of the past.  The Grand Demon Assembly would become a misnomer.</p><p>Qin Sang was pleased to see this change; he didn't want Qingyang Temple surrounded by demons.</p><p>…</p><p>Nine Rings Island.</p><p>Through years of cultivation by Master Zhijie and his disciples, Nine Rings Island had become a bustling hub for numerous cultivators.  Now, however, chaos reigned on Nine Rings Island.</p><p>Especially in the core forbidden area, the location of Master Zhijie's cave, clouds and mist swirled as a great formation was activated.  Countless demons and monsters fell in the sacred grounds.</p><p>However, outsiders couldn't obtain accurate records and dared not directly attack the demon territories. They could only gather information and make judgments based on various signs.</p><p>Master Zhijie hadn't appeared.  The surrounding powers were restless, initially probing, until they obtained accurate information and decided to unite and seize this geomantically auspicious location!</p><p>Master Zhijie's disciple activated the formation and remained entrenched, further fueling their suspicions.</p><p>Outside the forbidden area, a large army amassed.  Someone challenged them.</p><p>Inside the forbidden area, however, it was deathly silent; there was no reaction.  The curses from the allied army became increasingly vicious, until finally they couldn't restrain themselves any longer.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, inside the forbidden area, a thin, old man sat in a master chair, sipping spiritual tea, leisurely watching from outside.</p><p>A richly dressed man stood behind the elderly cultivator, his brow bearing a certain authority.  However, he remained respectfully bowed, awaiting instructions. This man was a registered disciple of Zhijie Zhenren, who, recognizing his abilities, had assigned him to manage the city's affairs.  Now, only this registered disciple remained in the restricted area; Zhijie Zhenren's direct disciples were nowhere to be found.</p><p>"Ignore invitations from other factions. I have ways to ensure your safety. Once I subdue these rabble, the Chamber of Commerce will send experts to garrison Nine Rings Island. You've managed the island well, piquing my interest. You'll have a role to play in the future..."</p><p>The thin elder spoke calmly, having taken over Nine Rings Island with Zhijie Zhenren's people, showing no concern about rebellion.</p><p>The richly dressed man smiled wryly to himself.  He'd been deemed unfit for cultivation by Zhijie Zhenren and relegated to mundane tasks, yet this misfortune had unexpectedly saved his life.</p><p>"I await your commands, senior!"</p><p>Before his words fully left his lips, the man saw the previously composed elder suddenly stand, his face changing drastically.  Something unforeseen had occurred.</p><p>The thin elder rushed out of the hall, gazing upward. After a moment, he muttered, "Thunder Escape? Could the Lei family finally have made their move? Wait... no, it can't be..."</p><p>An instant later, a bolt of lightning cleaved the sky, arriving in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The allied forces attacking the restricted area stopped their assault, staring in shock at the figure suspended in mid-air.</p><p>The lightning illuminated a figure whose features were indistinct, but the person made no attempt to conceal their aura – a formidable Yuan Ying mid-stage cultivator!  Behind them, a pair of magnificent phoenix wings shimmered.</p><p>Two individuals currently dominated the North Sea, their names known to all. Considering the rumors, along with the telltale Thunder Escape and phoenix wings, the clever quickly guessed the identity.</p><p>"The Xuan Tian Fiends!"</p><p>"No, the Beichen Fiends!"</p><p>Exclamations rang out, creating an uproar. Some called them Xuan Tian Fiends, others Beichen Fiends.</p><p>The arrival was Qin Sang, impatient with the speed of the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Shuttle, having used his phoenix wings to travel swiftly.  He chuckled at the shouts below.</p><p>Since news of their exploits spread, he and Liuli had been dubbed the Xuan Tian Fiends, a title embraced by North Sea cultivators and rapidly gaining traction. Later, Qin Sang spread the rumor that he and Liuli hailed from the legendary North Sea's fourth realm, the Beichen Realm, resulting in their new title: Beichen Fiends.</p><p>Poor Liuli was now portrayed as a venomous fiend.  It wasn't an exaggeration to say Qin Sang and Liuli's names were enough to silence even children in the North Sea.  The Hun Mo Elder and the Tianpeng Great Sage had fallen to them, solidifying their status as terrifying demons.  The Beichen Realm was also branded a demonic source, the most dreadful abyss.</p><p>Being feared wasn't necessarily a bad thing.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the allied forces, his gaze falling upon the restricted area. Through the formation, he witnessed the scene within.</p><p>The thin elder, ever shrewd, abandoned everything without hesitation upon seeing Qin Sang, fleeing immediately.</p><p>As he escaped through a secret passage, he heard a gentle voice.</p><p>"Friend, please wait."</p><p>The elder froze, his face contorted in a grimace that was more pained than amused.</p><p>"Greetings, Daoist Qin. I am Feng Guzi, an elder of Star Mountain.  Yinquan Zhenren is a close friend of mine. I never imagined you'd set your sights on Nine Rings Island.  We trespassed, I apologize.  We'll leave immediately, please forgive us..."</p><p>Several factions in the Xuan Yue Realm had planted agents in the Boundless Sea.  Their strength was inferior to native demons, but they could at least offer mutual assistance.  Now these agents were proving immensely useful.</p><p>Qin Sang studied Feng Guzi, nodding.  "Zhijie Zhenren's descendants are missing.  You must have gained quite a haul, haven't you?"</p><p>Feng Guzi breathed a sigh of relief, immediately producing a pouch and emptying its contents – including the cultivation techniques and secrets extracted from Zhijie Zhenren's disciples via soul-searching.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the jade slips, swept them up with a wave of his sleeve, and thanked him.</p><p>The elder repeatedly professed his unworthiness and hurried away.</p><p>Entering the restricted area, Qin Sang examined everything. He discovered not only Buddhist inheritances but also various secrets, potentially useful in Zhongzhou.</p><p>After collecting the useful jade slips, Qin Sang turned to the impassive richly dressed man. Feng Guzi had left him behind, suggesting a weak connection to Zhijie Zhenren, making him potentially useful.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed him a token inscribed with the character 'Qin,' bearing a unique mark.</p><p>"Should anyone else arrive, show them this...  You will be contacted again."</p><p>"I obey."</p><p>The man accepted the token with trembling hands, a weight lifting from his shoulders.</p><p>With him there, things might… settle down.</p>
