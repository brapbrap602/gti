Chapter 304: The Flawless Pearl


The White-Robed Scholar shook his head and sighed, "The Yin-Yang Compass... that's how Sheng Yuanzi died."

However, no one sympathized with Ge Yuan.

When disaster strikes, everyone scatters. If Ge Yuan had simply wanted to escape, no one could blame him.

But this man, in order to save his own life, chose the exact moment the Man-Headed Vulture attacked. His purpose was clearly to use the lives of others to block the creature and buy himself time to escape.

Among those he betrayed was Yun Youzi, who had saved his life.

If Yun Youzi hadn't completed the formation in time, Ge Yuan's sudden departure would have caused the Golden Ring Formation to collapse, and everyone would have perished under the Man-Headed Vulture's claws!

Ge Yuan's timing was perfect, but he never expected to be targeted by Luo Xingnan. Luo Xingnan, using the Yin-Yang Compass, toyed with him, pulling and pushing him before tossing him in front of a Hook Serpent King.

The serpent's mouth was inches away, its breath reeking of a foul stench.  But amidst the pungent odor, there was a hint of intoxicating sweetness, emanating from the red mist.

Ge Yuan, who had already experienced the power of the red mist, shuddered and quickly held his breath, not daring to inhale.

Ge Yuan's most trusted magical tools were a pair of Wu Hooks, one large and one small, male and female.

At this moment, the crimson snake's tongue flicked out from the serpent's mouth, stopping less than an inch from his face. Ge Yuan didn't dare hesitate for a moment and hurriedly activated his magical tools, striking fiercely at the serpent's mouth.

Two beams of sword light, one blue and one red, shot out, piercing straight into the serpent's mouth.

The Hook Serpent King reacted swiftly, its head jerking violently. Although it avoided having its brain pierced by the Wu Hooks, it paid the price of having its tongue severed.

The long tongue flew far away, blood gushing from the Hook Serpent King's mouth.

The Hook Serpent King, in pain, went berserk, its ferocious eyes fixed on Ge Yuan.

Unbeknownst to him, Ge Yuan's actions played right into Luo Xingnan's hands.

The Hook Serpents, significantly weakened and not numerous, were still incredibly difficult to deal with.  The two Hook Serpent Kings cooperated closely, and he couldn't find an opportunity to prepare his Talisman Treasure, unable to escape and covered in wounds, nearing his limit.

Fortunately, Ge Yuan had delivered himself.

Ge Yuan was certainly no match for the Hook Serpent King, but as long as he could attract its attention and block it for a moment, disrupting the serpent's encirclement, that would be enough.

It was a chance he couldn't miss.

Luo Xingnan gasped, pouring all his spiritual energy into the compass.  He shot out a black light, forcing the other Hook Serpent King back slightly, seizing the opportunity to escape.

Shangguan Lifeng, who had been diligently fending off the Hook Serpents and was already wounded, immediately sheathed his blade and followed.

Unexpectedly, seeing the Hook Serpents still in hot pursuit, a ruthless expression flashed across Luo Xingnan's face. He suddenly reversed the Yin-Yang Compass, aiming it at Shangguan Lifeng behind him.

'Swish!'

Shangguan Lifeng's expression was stunned, seemingly in disbelief. He had kept his agreement, been utterly loyal to Luo Xingnan, only to meet such an end.

Then, Shangguan Lifeng gave a resigned, wry smile, raising his blade and unleashing blade energy to resist the black light. But his movements were forced to a halt, and by the time the black light dissipated, the Hook Serpent King was already upon him.

The changes happened incredibly fast, like a flash of lightning.  The situation had shifted several times.

Luo Xingnan, abandoning two lives, actually managed to escape.

At this point, Qin Sang no longer cared about exposure. He was about to open his Mustard Seed Bag and take out the Ten Yama Banners for a desperate fight.

Just then, Yun Youzi looked at Qin Sang with a grave expression, saying in a deep voice, "Brother Qin, it's up to you now!"

Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, "Senior, you..."

Then he saw light converging in front of Yun Youzi, and the Flawless Pearl slowly rose from the light. The scene of wind and thunder, the interplay of yin and yang, became even more vivid and detailed, mysteriously abnormal.

Yun Youzi's earlier words about exhausting his Qi Sea to activate the Flawless Pearl were clearly not an exaggeration.  His internal spiritual energy surged into the pearl, the violent fluctuations visible to the naked eye.

However, this time was very different from the last time in the underground magma. Yun Youzi's spiritual energy was being drained by the Flawless Pearl, but that wasn't all. It seemed to be absorbing his vital essence as well!

Yun Youzi, whose face was already very old, was now deathly pale, without a trace of blood. The wrinkles on his face deepened, and his aura was decaying at an alarming rate, extremely weak.

Describing him as barely clinging to life wouldn't be an exaggeration.

But with this came a dramatic change in the Flawless Pearl.

Even Luo Xingnan, in the distance, noticed the anomaly here, turning back for a surprised glance amidst his escape.

This was the first time Qin Sang had witnessed Yun Youzi unleash the full power of the Flawless Pearl.

The pearl radiated a dazzling light, emitting brilliant blue rays, almost transforming into a blue sun.  An extremely violent aura emanated from the Flawless Pearl.

This aura was very peculiar, bearing some resemblance to demonic Qi. Sensing this aura, both the Man-Headed Vulture and the Hook Serpents became subtly restless.

The White-Robed Scholar was utterly shocked, murmuring, "This aura seems like demonic Qi. Could it be a magical tool refined from a demon core?"

Demon cores only formed within Demonic Beasts that had broken through to the Demon Core stage, similar to the Golden Core of human cultivators.

Demonic Beasts possessing demon cores were as rare as Golden Core cultivators, and their strength was comparable.

However, neither demon cores nor magical tools refined from them were within the reach of Foundation Establishment cultivators like them.

Qin Sang didn't know if demon cores could be used to refine magical tools and couldn't definitively identify what the Flawless Pearl was.

He even wondered if the Flawless Pearl could be a true magical treasure?

But Qin Sang quickly dismissed the idea. If the Flawless Pearl truly was a treasure, Yun Youzi, not being a Golden Core cultivator, wouldn't be able to use it.

The genuine Ten Yama Banners in Qin Sang's Mustard Seed Bag were treasures. He had tried to use them more than once, but each attempt was fruitless. The same was true for the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings he obtained from Elder Di Que's belongings.

However, even if the Flawless Pearl wasn't a true treasure, its immense power was undeniable.

He wondered if the Ten Yama Formation, with all ten ghost banners assembled, could compare to the Flawless Pearl.

"Screech!"

The Man-Headed Vulture's cry was filled with intense anxiety.  Suddenly, it flapped its giant wings, transforming into a streak of black light as it attacked. Its target was clear: Yun Youzi.

Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately flashed in front of Yun Youzi, unhesitatingly activating the power of his Talisman Treasure.

All the illusory jade ruyi returned to Qin Sang's palm, becoming a seemingly real ruyi, as if crafted from the purest jade. Then Qin Sang raised his hand, the jade ruyi trembled slightly, and transformed into a streak of white light, shooting outwards.

At the same time, the Golden Ring Formation, entrusted to the White-Robed Scholar, was also activated.

This time it wasn't a sneak attack, the Man-Headed Vulture was prepared.

The significantly weakened Golden Ring Formation was torn apart by its sharp claws, the set of restrictive tools completely destroyed.

And during the struggle, the Talisman Treasure, due to Qin Sang's depleted spiritual energy, reverted to a talisman paper, fluttering down, covered in countless cracks, likely usable only once more.
