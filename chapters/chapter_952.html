<h1>Chapter 944: Chaos</h1><p>The formation shattered the magical barrier, subduing the undead spirits, creating a tremendous spectacle, yet the disturbance didn't travel far.  After the upheaval, the cloud mass above the desolate land briefly glowed, easily dissipating the unusual phenomenon. The commotion didn't even reach beyond the Purple Mist Desolate Land.</p><p>The Great Rift within was affected, but there was no significant collapse; only the ferocious beasts deep within the rift were startled.  Qin Sang and Bai faintly heard chanting.</p><p>Bai felt relieved.  He stared blankly at the sky, having finally fulfilled his vow, yet his eyes held a hint of confusion and wistfulness.</p><p>"My obsession is resolved. I will journey far, seeking myself. I will pay my respects to you all another day," Bai silently vowed.</p><p>The aftershocks hit them like a lone boat in a storm. Bai focused his energy to gather the ghost mist, carrying them toward the canyon.</p><p>Qin Sang urged his double-headed  beast forward, activating its phoenix wings, constantly ready to awaken his external avatar. If any unforeseen event occurred, he could only sacrifice a pawn to save the king, using his avatar to distract the Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>They were already hidden near the canyon mouth, arriving in an instant.  They faintly heard enraged roars.</p><p>The combined forces of the magical barrier, the subduing formation, and the ghost mist created utter chaos outside the canyon.  Using the Sky-Eye Butterfly's divine ability, Qin Sang saw magical barriers on the canyon walls begin to crumble, causing rockfalls, but the mountains only trembled, not collapsing.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire had been scattered, and the Yuan Ying cultivator was being assaulted.</p><p>Outside the canyon, a bright, ghastly light flickered, revealing countless rectangular bone tile phantoms.  These tiles seemed to contain trapped malevolent spirits, emitting chilling screams.</p><p>"It's the bone tiles!" Qin Sang realized, recalling a previously glimpsed vision.</p><p>"Go!" Bai urgently transmitted.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded; the aftershocks were at their peak.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivator, under the protection of the bone tile formation, seemed unharmed. Unfortunately, the spiritual energy was too chaotic, limiting the Sky-Eye's vision, obscuring the true nature of the bone tile formation.</p><p>The magical barrier's disintegration started from the center of the ghost land. Because the canyon entrance's barrier was the weakest and Bai specifically targeted it, it disintegrated quickly. Once the surrounding barriers collapsed and the ghost mist dissipated, the Yuan Ying cultivator would regain their footing and hunt them down; escape would then be impossible.</p><p>Therefore, they had to flee while the Yuan Ying cultivator was distracted.</p><p>They exchanged glances, leaping into the canyon. One used divine abilities, the other their treasure, working together seamlessly, drifting with the ghost mist, quickly escaping the canyon.</p><p>They dared not breathe, their hearts pounding as they passed through the bone tile formation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Old Master Mou was desperately powering the formation, his face grim.  He never anticipated such an upheaval within the ghost land; a terrifying wave appeared suddenly, instantly scattering his coveted demon fire.</p><p>Caught off guard, Old Master Mou was heavily struck, flung far away. Fortunately, the demon fire was weakened, and the previously laid bone tile formation shielded him.  Otherwise, the outcome would have been disastrous.</p><p>Watching the demon fire dissipate, Old Master Mou's heart bled.  Unlike others, he didn't care about the treasures within the ghost land; the demon fire was his sole objective.</p><p>Subduing the demon fire would significantly increase his chances of advancing to the late Yuan Ying stage, becoming a top expert in the Canglang Sea, even with a slight chance of achieving the transformation to a Divine Being.</p><p>His dreams shattered, Old Master Mou raged.  Some of the bone tiles were cracking, yet he showed no sign of retreat. He desperately powered the formation, resisting the impact, and surged forward to block the canyon.</p><p>Even at the most perilous moment, Old Master Mou maintained a sliver of consciousness to investigate, wary of missing something. Without the ancient treasure Red Yuan Sha and Bai's ghost mist manipulation, he might have detected something.</p><p>Without the demon fire, only obtaining the treasures within could compensate for his loss.  Before the mysterious person's appearance, no one had ventured into the ghost land.</p><p>Old Master Mou didn't know what the mysterious person triggered, causing such a disturbance. He assumed the person was also suffering, unable to escape unharmed.</p><p>If the mysterious person died on the spot, Old Master Mou would consider it a lucky break. If they were severely injured and fleeing, even better. He could intercept them, gaining both the ghost land treasures and the chance to search their soul to learn how they resisted the demon fire and infiltrated the ghost land.  Perhaps he could even find the demon fire later.</p><p>Just then, Lao Mo sensed the fluctuations weakening.  His spirits lifted, he pushed the formation to its limits, charging into the canyon.  He didn't realize the main target had already escaped the moment he'd been struck.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai escaped successfully.  Seeing they hadn't been detected, they relaxed slightly, though they dared not be complacent. After awakening the Fat Silkworm, they fled at full speed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before reaching the canyon wall, they heard roars echoing from the depths of the canyon â€“ sounds like tigers and dragons, drawing closer.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded.  He quickly asked, "Are there Yuan Ying-level beasts here?"</p><p>Bai nodded. "Over the years, a few have lingered near the demonic fire, possessing the aura of Yuan Ying.  As for how many, I'm unsure."</p><p>Qin Sang's face fell.  "We must leave immediately.  My escape techniques are superior to yours.  Since your Heavenly Corpse Talisman and soul mark are intact, perhaps you can enter the Corpse Puppet Bag.  Would you be willing to endure this inconvenience?"</p><p>The top-tier beasts had been roused. A clash with that Yuan Ying cultivator was likely.</p><p>But Qin Sang had no intention of reaping the benefits of such a conflict. He'd already gained enough; there was no need to risk it. Besides, that Yuan Ying cultivator possessed extremely high cultivation; the beasts might not be able to stop him.</p><p>Bai had first opened the sacrificial altar and then used ghost mist to obscure the Yuan Ying cultivator, exhausting a great deal of energy. He had little left, and his escape techniques were far inferior to Qin Sang's.</p><p>Their oath demanded mutual assistance until they were out of danger. Qin Sang wouldn't break his promise, but he couldn't be burdened by Bai, so he had him try the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>He had many questions to ask Bai later, once they were safe.</p><p>"Having witnessed your escape techniques...in the face of such danger, a little inconvenience is nothing."</p><p>Bai showed no concern.  Seeing Qin Sang open the Corpse Puppet Bag, he relaxed some of the restrictions on the puppet's soul.</p><p>Perhaps because Bai was originally just a wisp of a soul, with a single incantation, Qin Sang actually managed to store him within.</p><p>"It's quiet here. I can take the opportunity to recuperate. Thank you."</p><p>Qin Sang heard Bai's voice transmission, looked at the Corpse Puppet Bag with surprise, then spread his phoenix wings, summoned the Jiao soul around his body, and simultaneously summoned the ebony sword, unleashing the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability.</p><p>Employing three top-tier escape techniques simultaneously, Qin Sang transformed into a tri-colored streak of green, red, and white light, fleeing in desperation, not even daring to retrieve the purple crystal.</p><p>A top-tier beast's aura was approaching from that direction.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm grumbled its displeasure; Qin Sang had broken his word.</p>
