<h1>Chapter 1943: Great Completion</h1><p>“Steamed… buns?”</p><p>Dongjia’s lips twitched, his tone changing slightly.</p><p>It was fortunate that Qin Sang was a distinguished guest invited by Qingyuan; otherwise, with his temperament, he would have found it hard to endure.</p><p>Qingyuan chuckled and shook his head, not knowing what to say.</p><p>Dongjia remained silent for a good while. “The Seven Delicacies Feast includes a dish called ‘Jade Pouch Offering Treasures.’ It’s made with seven precious fish from the Blue Lake in the capital, formed into fish rice. Thin slices of Mountain Treasure White Jade Bamboo Shoots, as delicate as cicada wings, are used to create jade pouches.  These pouches are then filled with the fish rice and other ingredients, truly a delicacy among delicacies. If this doesn't suit Daoist Master’s taste, we can prepare a separate main course for you…”</p><p>Having settled on the Seven Delicacies Feast, Dongjia went to the kitchen to get busy.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't truly intended to make things difficult for Dongjia, but rather to buy himself some time to contemplate how to handle the situation.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's true body stood somewhere else, hands clasped behind his back, gazing towards Jin County.</p><p>His expression was unusually grave as he ran through the scenario repeatedly in his mind.</p><p>No matter how many times he replayed it, the answer remained the same—he couldn't do it!</p><p>He even doubted whether a cultivator at the late Void Refinement stage could accomplish it.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't truly faced a Void Refinement cultivator in direct combat, but based on his own deductions, he could estimate their general capabilities.</p><p>Before breaking through a major realm, there wouldn’t be any fundamental transformation.</p><p>Unless this Qingyuan possessed some special cultivation technique or divine ability.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lin Baoshan's cultivation level was too low, the gap between him and Qingyuan as vast as a chasm. Based on this single encounter, he couldn't discern much more.</p><p>If Qingyuan could display the same power against a Nascent Soul cultivator, that would be truly terrifying. Anyone facing him would have to think thrice before using any Daoist arts.</p><p>…</p><p>Drunken Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to wait and see, to understand Qingyuan's true purpose.</p><p>Before the main course, cold dishes were served, each made with rare ingredients rarely seen by ordinary people. The tea served was also a tribute tea from the Yan Kingdom.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the serving girls, having Yulang pour tea and water, with Tao Teng assisting.</p><p>Qingyuan took a sip of tea, gazing out the window at the houses stretching all the way to the city walls.</p><p>The street below was bustling with activity.</p><p>The hawkers' cries, the laughter of children, the New Year greetings exchanged, even the sounds of arguments.</p><p>Firecrackers, gongs and drums, the rhythmic beat of pellet drums…</p><p>After Lin Baoshan left, Qin Sang removed the restrictive barrier, and all the sounds poured into the private room, creating a lively atmosphere.</p><p>“Truly a time of human celebration.”</p><p>Qingyuan seemed to be moved, sighing softly. “Daoist Master, coming down the mountain, do you not find it too lonely up there?”</p><p>“Those of us who cultivate the Dao must endure solitude. This humble Daoist has descended the mountain for other reasons, and it hasn't been long.”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke the truth, but omitted key information.</p><p>He turned his gaze to Qingyuan. “Fellow Daoist, have you always been traveling?”</p><p>“Indeed. I appreciate good food, and each region nurtures its own unique customs. Even though I’ve seen much, there are always surprises to be found.”</p><p>Qingyuan smiled faintly, then his smile faded. “Unfortunately, not every place is like the Yan Kingdom, prosperous and with its people living in peace and contentment. Even within the Yan Kingdom, there's not only joy.  The human world is never without its joys and sorrows, its winds of misfortune and rains of hardship.”</p><p>“Is it only the mortal realm?  The sea of suffering is vast, how many can cross it?”</p><p>Since Qingyuan was so inclined to conversation, Qin Sang set aside his distracting thoughts and echoed his sentiment.</p><p>This sigh came from the depths of his heart.</p><p>If ascending to immortality meant escaping the sea of suffering, then considering the entire Grand World, how many have truly succeeded in ascending?</p><p>Every realm is a difficult hurdle, blocking countless individuals.</p><p>“You and I, we’re at least better off than those people.”</p><p>Qingyuan pointed at Qin Sang, then at himself, before suddenly turning to look at Yulang and Tao Teng, who were listening quietly.</p><p>“You are both scholars, studying the writings of sages. People often speak of the human Dao, the human Dao. What exactly is the Great Dao of humanity?”</p><p>Yulang and Tao Teng didn't expect Qingyuan to address them, and were both stunned.</p><p>At this moment, they felt an inexplicable pressure, greater than when called upon by their teacher, and couldn't help but sit up straight.</p><p>Yulang furrowed his brow deeply, lost in thought.</p><p>Tao Teng waited for a moment, seeing his companion silent, and boldly replied, “Between father and son, there is affection; between ruler and minister, there is righteousness; between husband and wife, there is distinction; between elder and younger, there is order; between friends, there is trust.”</p><p>Qingyuan hummed in acknowledgment. “This can be called the Dao of human relationships, sufficient for governing a nation.”</p><p>Tao Teng didn't receive the praise he expected, so he scratched his head, thought for a moment, and then recited, “When the Great Dao prevails, the world is a commonwealth.  The virtuous and able are chosen, and trust and harmony are cultivated.  Therefore, people do not regard only their own parents as parents, nor do they treat only their own children as children. The elderly are provided for until death, the able-bodied are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, childless, disabled, and diseased are all cared for…”</p><p>Qingyuan smiled but remained silent, looking at Yulang. “The little Daoist Master seems to have a different opinion?”</p><p>Yulang glanced at his master, then at his companion.</p><p>In this room, Tao Teng was the only mortal.</p><p>He hesitated for a moment, then instead of answering, posed a question:  “Are mortals destined to be mere fish on the chopping block?”</p><p>What Tao Teng spoke of, if left undisturbed by external forces, would naturally be the most ideal world imaginable.</p><p>But the world contained not only humans, but also immortals, gods, demons, and monsters.</p><p>Mortals without extraordinary power were like pigs and dogs, to be slaughtered at will.</p><p>Even if the mortal realm truly achieved the Great Harmony spoken of by the sages, if it couldn't protect itself, it would be like a flower in a mirror, the moon in the water.</p><p>For instance, Jin County, without the protection of the City God and other spirits, would it be so peaceful and harmonious today?</p><p>Could this kind of human Dao be considered the Great Dao?</p><p>Tao Teng stared blankly at Yulang, somewhat confused, unable to grasp the deeper meaning of the question.</p><p>Qingyuan's eyes, however, lit up, and he laughed heartily. “At such a young age, to be able to think of these things, and to have seriously considered them, is truly remarkable. The Daoist Master has taught a good disciple. This question truly resonates with the worldly debate of the Great Vehicle and the Small Vehicle.”</p><p>Having said this, Qingyuan suddenly stopped speaking.</p><p>Then, a knock came at the door of the private room.</p><p>“Enter,” Qingyuan said.</p><p>A man dressed as an attendant gently pushed the door open, bowing first to those seated at the main table. “Greetings, gentlemen.”</p><p>He then turned to Tao Teng. “Young Master, it's getting late. It's time to leave. The Master has asked me to fetch you.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Tao Teng was reluctant, not only because he didn't want to part with his companion, but also because he wanted to hear what profound insights this gentleman had to offer.</p><p>His intuition told him that this gentleman, like Daoist Qingfeng, was an extraordinary person.</p><p>The attendant, however, was oblivious, urging, “Young Master, the Master is waiting for you downstairs.”</p><p>“Alas!”</p><p>Tao Teng had no choice but to sigh deeply, rising to his feet and tightly gripping Yulang’s hand. “Yulang, you must come find me in the capital someday!”</p><p>Then, bowing to Qin Sang and Qingyuan, he reluctantly followed the attendant out of the room.</p><p>“Great Vehicle, Small Vehicle…”</p><p>Both Qin Sang's true body and his avatar in the Drunken Fragrance Pavilion were momentarily lost in thought, repeating these two terms in their minds.</p><p>Vaguely, he seemed to have grasped something.</p><p>“This Great Vehicle is not that Great Vehicle, although there should be a connection.”</p><p>Qingyuan glanced at Qin Sang and continued, “Small Vehicle, Great Vehicle, they only differ in their pursuits, not in their inherent worth. Broadly speaking, the Small Vehicle is for self-salvation, while the Great Vehicle is for the salvation of others!”</p><p>Self-salvation!</p><p>Salvation of others!</p><p>It was as if a bolt of lightning flashed through Qin Sang's mind, instantly illuminating many past doubts.</p><p>The path of the Small Vehicle, cultivating oneself, at its ultimate point, wasn't it achieving immortality and transcendence?</p><p>What about the ultimate point of the Great Vehicle?</p><p>This world contained not only humans, but also demons, witches, all living beings, and even the entire Grand World.</p><p>Could it be, to bring this heaven and earth along on the journey of salvation?</p><p>“The Divine Dao…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>He had always harbored doubts about the Divine Dao.</p><p>Especially since he knew that the origin of the Divine Dao might be related to the Dao Court.</p><p>Back then, why did some members of the Dao Court switch to cultivating the Divine Dao? What doctrines did they base their decision on?</p><p>Divine Dao cultivation relied on the worship of incense and offerings, which was clearly contrary to Qin Sang's understanding of the Immortal Dao.</p><p>Immortal Dao cultivation pursued ascension to immortality.</p><p>But what about the Divine Dao?</p><p>If a Divine Dao cultivator ascended alone, unable to bring their followers to the Immortal Realm, even if their faith wasn't directly severed, there would likely be unforeseen circumstances in the lower realm, wouldn't there?</p><p>Unless there was free passage between the Immortal Realm and the lower realm.</p><p>Moreover, the more followers a Divine Dao cultivator had, the more attachments they accumulated, how could they transcend?</p><p>So, there was a path of the Great Vehicle!</p><p>“The Divine Dao can be considered a Great Vehicle, but in my opinion, the Divine Dao as it has evolved today, with some Divine Dao cultivators losing their way, treating the human Dao merely as sustenance for the Divine Dao, can hardly be considered the orthodox path of humanity.  The Great Vehicle benefits all under heaven, whether cultivating merit, cultivating virtue, cultivating blessings, or accumulating hidden virtues… It originates from the human Dao.  In my travels, I've observed some promising developments, some even inspired by the Divine Dao, perhaps a King’s Dao, a Sage’s Dao, or various other paths.  The future is full of possibilities. Perhaps one day, a hundred schools of thought will contend, and a multitude of Daos will flourish, which may resolve the little Daoist Master’s questions.”</p><p>Qingyuan spoke eloquently.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't interject, nor did he want to, only wishing for Qingyuan to continue.</p><p>The joy of hearing the Dao!</p><p>This was precisely how Qin Sang felt.</p><p>This encounter, this karmic connection, came unexpectedly, catching him off guard.</p><p>Meeting by chance on the path, hearing the Dao from a stranger’s mouth, it seemed absurd, making one worry about potential traps.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could judge for himself. He had already had vague insights, but they lacked a coherent system.</p><p>Qingyuan’s discourse perfectly aligned with his thoughts and was even more comprehensive.</p><p>It not only resolved many of Qin Sang’s doubts,</p><p>but even subtly touched upon his own understanding of his cultivation.</p><p>Yulang’s realm wasn't high enough to grasp the deeper meaning, and at this moment, he was still pondering his own questions.</p><p>His thoughts couldn't escape the eyes of these two.</p><p>“The little Daoist Master still seems a bit discontented. Whether it's the Divine Dao, the King’s Dao, or the Sage’s Dao, mortals must rely on others, unable to truly control their own destiny, is that not so?”</p><p>Qingyuan smiled slightly. “You only see cultivators as the butcher and mortals as the fish, but do you not see that among cultivators, among mortals, there is also strength and weakness, oppression and exploitation? I weaved the story of the young lady from the Yin family and the spirits of Jin County, and what could they do to me? If everyone could cultivate, wouldn’t Qi Refinement cultivators become like mortals today, and could the Grand World withstand it?  Have you not seen locusts swarm, leaving no blade of grass behind?”</p><p>Qin Sang also looked at his disciple, his voice deep. “Have you forgotten your teacher’s words? A person without ambition cannot stand, but beware of empty talk and lofty aspirations.”</p><p>“Indeed. There's a saying in the mortal realm, ‘Don't meddle in affairs that are not your concern.’  If you want to change the world… well… at least catch up to your master first.”</p><p>Qingyuan finished the water in his cup and picked up the teapot.</p><p>“This disciple understands and obeys,” Yulang seemed to awaken from a dream, quickly taking the teapot and filling Qingyuan and his master’s cups.</p><p>The tea flowed gently.</p><p>His thoughts seemed to settle as well, sitting upright, his brow no longer furrowed.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qingyuan continued their previous topic.</p><p>“In the cultivation world, the debate concerning the Small Vehicle and the Great Vehicle is becoming increasingly heated, especially within the Buddhist sects. But there are exceptions, such as the Alchemy branch of the Daoist sect. Although they cultivate the Small Vehicle Dao arts, they possess the magnanimity of the Great Vehicle!”</p><p>Qingyuan’s face showed admiration.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred, and he couldn’t help but ask, “How so?”</p><p>Qingyuan picked up his folding fan and drew a large circle in the air.</p><p>“In the Grand World, the five elemental spiritual energies are ubiquitous. Cultivating through comprehending the five elements, compared to other paths, can be said to be the easiest.</p><p>“After stepping onto the path of cultivation, switching to another Dao is like building a bridge across a chasm. Although this bridge leads to other directions, walking on land is undoubtedly easier than flying directly across the chasm.</p><p>“Legend has it that this bridge originated from the Alchemy branch of the Daoist sect!</p><p>“Back then, the Daoist sect combined the five elements, creating the Golden Core Dao, leading directly to the Great Dao, and then spread these Dao arts throughout the world.</p><p>“Since then, human cultivation seems to have found its foundation. Regardless of sect or school, one first cultivates the five element techniques to enter the gate of cultivation, and then gradually clarifies their path, pursuing their own Dao.  It can be considered the foundation of all methods!</p><p>“The rise of humanity, surpassing all other races in the Grand World, is inseparable from the contributions of the Daoist sect!</p><p>“The five elemental spiritual roots have also become the most important method for determining human talent.</p><p>“The cultivation realms of the Alchemy branch – Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and even Great Completion – have become prevalent throughout the world and are constantly being refined.</p><p>“Each breakthrough to a new realm is accompanied by a transformation, with clear guidelines, convincing and now revered by the world as the standard.</p><p>“From this, we can see that the Alchemy sect’s naming of the final realm as ‘Great Completion’ was no accident!</p><p>“Cultivating the Dao to save oneself, and using the Dao arts to benefit others, what a great merit this is!”</p><p>These words deeply shocked Qin Sang.</p><p>He had read Daoist scriptures in the Talisman World and seen some records about the Alchemy branch, knowing that the Alchemy sect and the Talisman sect were once considered the two most important branches of the Daoist sect.</p><p>Due to the scarcity of records, Qin Sang could only glimpse through the fog, guessing that the Alchemy sect might have later declined, or perhaps had a disagreement with the Talisman sect, leading to their separation.</p><p>At its peak, the Talisman sect possessed astonishing power.</p><p>But Qin Sang hadn't expected that the achievements of the Alchemy sect were in no way inferior to the later Talisman sect!</p><p>Now, the vast majority of cultivators entered the immortal sects through the five elements, and all owed a debt of gratitude to the Daoist sect!</p><p>“Food and wine are here!”</p><p>A shout came from outside the private room.</p><p>A waiter quickly arrived at the door, knocked gently, and pushed the door open, carrying a tray.</p><p>On the tray was a dish of exquisite artistry, steaming hot and exuding a rich aroma.</p><p>Instantly, the room was filled with fragrance.</p><p>The perfect combination of color, aroma, and taste stimulated the appetite.</p><p>The waiter beamed. “The first course, ‘Phoenix Welcomes Spring’!”</p><p>Along with the dish came a pot of wine.  “This is a fine wine, ‘Drunken Spring Breeze.’ Please enjoy, honored guests.”</p><p>The waiter bowed slightly and exited the private room.</p><p>Qingyuan set down his folding fan and looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>“If the Alchemy branch is such, what must the Talisman branch, once known as the Great Completion Dao Sect, have been like!”</p><p>“This one has always yearned to know!”</p>
