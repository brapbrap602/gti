<h1>Chapter 1274: Thunder's Roar</h1><p>If there were soul shadows of mid or even late Nascent Soul stage, wouldn't I also be able to sense them and comprehend the higher realms of spiritual insight? Sensing the soul shadows left by cultivators of the same level would undoubtedly be of great benefit to me!</p><p>Back at the Blood Lake, Qin Sang hadn't had the time to thoroughly investigate. He had only noticed the countless chaotic and frenzied soul shadows within the talisman puppet, like a procession of a hundred ghosts in the night. He hadn't expected to stumble upon such an unexpected treasure!</p><p>Inside the cave abode, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, holding the talisman puppet in his hand. A faint blue light enveloped the puppet, as Qing Jun had placed several layers of restrictions on it to prevent it from going out of control. Qin Sang didn't know how the Upper Purity Palace had managed it, but with the protection of his Jade Buddha, he had no fear of the puppet devouring his soul. Without hesitation, he delved into the puppet's interior, searching intently.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang wasn't the first to have this idea. The successive generations of patriarchs from the Upper Purity Palace had also attempted it. There were indeed soul shadows of mid-Nascent Soul stage within the talisman puppet, but none of a higher realm. It was unclear whether no great cultivators had used the puppet or if there were other reasons. However, the strongest soul shadows were hidden deep within the puppet's core.</p><p>The cultivators of the Upper Purity Palace only dared to sense the two or three soul shadows on the periphery. Now, the interior of the puppet had become increasingly chaotic, and even the outer soul shadows were extremely dangerous. To seek the mid-Nascent Soul soul shadows, one had to venture deep into the puppet's core. Doing so without protection, exposing one's soul to the soul shadows, would mean enduring the agony of having one's soul devoured while attempting to comprehend them. Even great cultivators couldn't withstand this. Unless one had a method to protect their soul, the effort would not be worth the gain.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, had no such concerns. His soul radiated a blinding golden light, causing the soul shadows to retreat, unable to harm him in the slightest. The deeper he went, the stronger the soul shadows became. In the end, he indeed found three mid-Nascent Soul soul shadows!</p><p>"I wonder which generation of the Upper Purity Palace's patriarchs crafted this talisman puppet. It seems it has been a long time, and three mid-Nascent Soul patriarchs have emerged since then," Qin Sang mused to himself, feeling a surge of joy.</p><p>The soul shadows, their faces twisted in rage, lunged at him but were powerless against him. After some thought, Qin Sang decided not to rush into sensing the soul shadows. Instead, he withdrew. He had only recently formed his Nascent Soul and was still far from reaching the mid-Nascent Soul stage. He could start with the outer soul shadows and gradually deepen his comprehension as his cultivation progressed.</p><p>"What kind of spiritual material was used to craft this talisman puppet to have such an extraordinary effect? It's a pity there are no late Nascent Soul or Soul Transformation stage soul shadows. Otherwise, breaking through later would be much easier..." Qin Sang played with the Nascent Soul talisman puppet, unable to put it down. It felt warm and smooth like jade, but its material was unrecognizable.</p><p>"Fortunately, Dongyang Bo didn't get his hands on this. Otherwise, Shaohua Mountain might have seen the rise of a new Nascent Soul cultivator. When the opportunity arises, I should let Mu Yifeng and Li Yufu try it. The prosperity of Qingyang Temple is within reach! But without the Jade Buddha, how would they sense the soul shadows?" Qin Sang pondered this dilemma for a moment before suddenly remembering something. "The Inner Landscape Talisman! That's it! The Inner Landscape Talisman must be the treasure that helps the disciples of the Upper Purity Palace sense the soul shadows. It also serves to divert attention, preventing others from connecting it to the talisman puppet. However, several generations of Upper Purity Palace disciples have failed to form their Nascent Souls. Is it solely because their talents were insufficient?"</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the Inner Landscape Talisman was a Golden Core-level secret talisman, which might no longer be sufficient to protect them. The interior of the talisman puppet was extremely chaotic, and without the Jade Buddha, he wouldn't dare to attempt it either. For the time being, Qin Sang couldn't think of a good solution.</p><p>At that moment, he sensed the cave's restrictions being triggered. Raising his head, he scanned with his divine sense and saw Jingyu and Fat Chicken. He stood up and went out to meet them.</p><p>"Has your cultivation been restored?" Qin Sang examined Jingyu. Her cultivation was higher than his, likely at the peak of the early Transformation stage. If Jingyu could break through to the mid-Transformation stage and agree to protect Qingyang Temple, he could set out on his travels with peace of mind.</p><p>Jingyu nodded. "Thank you for the pills you sent. With a bit more rest, I can attempt to break through. However, before I go into seclusion, I should help you place the Corpse Flower Blood Amber into the spiritual vein. Have you gathered all the spiritual materials needed for the formation in the secret technique?"</p><p>"I've sent people to search for them. Although those materials are rare, they shouldn't be too difficult to find. I wonder how many years of arduous cultivation these three pieces of Corpse Flower Blood Amber will save me!" Qin Sang's face showed anticipation. Once the Corpse Flower Blood Amber was purified, he could sense the soul shadows while refining the spiritual medicine, and his cultivation would surely advance by leaps and bounds!</p><p>Jingyu hesitated. "I can't say for certain. My ancestors were fortunate enough to obtain Corpse Flower Blood Amber and treated it as a treasure, using it to break through. None of them directly refined and absorbed it! Have you considered trading the Corpse Flower Blood Amber with other demon kings for treasures?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment before resolutely shaking his head. At this level of cultivation, even saving ten years of arduous cultivation was incredibly precious, opening up more possibilities. Since he could use it himself, there was no need to trade it away. It was unlikely he would get something better in return, unless it was a treasure that could aid in breaking through. And now, with the talisman puppet in hand, if he could break through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage sooner, he could travel and seek opportunities for Soul Transformation and the remaining fragments of the Slaughter Sword. Even if he traded for some external treasures, how could they compare to his own advancement? He wasn't lacking in magical treasures.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's determination, Jingyu didn't press further. She hesitated for a moment, her expression troubled.</p><p>Qin Sang, curious, waited quietly to see what would happen.</p><p>Jingyu called Fat Chicken over and said, "When I left, he was still young and only had a nickname. To this day, he hasn't been given a proper name, which is quite embarrassing. Fellow Daoist Qin, you've done so much for him, almost like giving him a new life. Could I ask you to bestow him with a name?"</p><p>"How could I possibly do that?" Qin Sang was taken aback, waving his hand in refusal. It felt somewhat strange to him.</p><p>But Jingyu insisted, and Fat Chicken also bowed to Qin Sang.</p><p>Unable to refuse, Qin Sang pondered for a moment. "The Thunder Falcon is born with the innate ability to control thunder. How about the Dharma name 'Thunder's Roar'?"</p><p>Fat Chicken was overjoyed and kowtowed in gratitude. "Thunder's Roar thanks the senior for bestowing this name!"</p><p>Jingyu's face was filled with relief. She then added, "Fellow Daoist Qin, I just heard from Thunder's Roar that he once swore an oath that if he could rescue me, he would acknowledge you as his master..."</p><p>Before Jingyu could finish, Qin Sang interrupted with a smile, "That was just a jest. I never agreed to it, Fellow Daoist. There's no need to take it to heart."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, don't misunderstand!" Jingyu quickly explained. "You gifted Thunder's Roar the divine thunder power of the Azure Phoenix, greatly enhancing his potential, and you also rescued me from the dark prison. We are not ungrateful people. I heard that you have plans to establish a sect and command the myriad demons of the Thousand Bamboo Sea. If I fail to break through, then it's all for naught, and Thunder's Roar can serve by your side. But if I succeed, could I take his place and remain as the mountain-guarding spirit beast?"</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly stunned. He had originally set his sights on Jingyu, but he hadn't expected her to offer herself voluntarily as the mountain-guarding spirit beast.</p><p>"Do you mean it?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Jingyu solemnly replied, "I can swear a blood oath."</p><p>Thunder's Roar was frantic, wanting to argue, but Jingyu pointed her jade-like finger, silencing him.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. This outcome was even better than he had anticipated. However, a great demon of the Transformation stage couldn't truly be treated as a mere spirit beast, and it would be impossible to keep her bound to the sect forever.</p>
