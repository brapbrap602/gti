<h1>Chapter 383: Flying Horned Fish-Dragons</h1><p>Ice and snow.</p><p>Heavy snow flurries.</p><p>A piercingly cold wind swept in.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled spiritual power to protect his body, blocking the biting wind, and curiously surveyed the scene before him.</p><p>After Yun Youzi touched the small grass, everything around them shattered like a reflection in water, and the world abruptly changed.</p><p>Only at this moment did those present realize that the seemingly real plants and trees were actually an illusion.</p><p>Suddenly, the sky and earth darkened, merging with the boundless snowy expanse, and nothing could be seen.</p><p>The wind howled.</p><p>The earth transformed into an ice field.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there was only a vast expanse of white. The wind and snow were like knives, scraping against Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's bodies.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that if an ordinary person were standing here, they would have been flayed and torn to pieces by now.</p><p>Besides the whistling wind, nothing could be heard.</p><p>Yun Youzi, who had been crouching on the ground, stood up, nodded to Qin Sang, and walked towards the depths of the ice field, facing the wind and snow.</p><p>The forested area was actually not large. If they used flying swords, they could reach the end in the blink of an eye. However, after the ice field returned to its original appearance, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi walked for a long time, yet they still hadn't reached its edge.</p><p>The ice field seemed endless.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder if they had broken the illusion or triggered some restriction, being transported to another place.</p><p>"Brother Qin, after this matter is settled, you can return the same way. It won't be as troublesome as now; it will only take ten breaths to get out," Yun Youzi's voice transmission reached Qin Sang, reminding him in time.</p><p>"This old Daoist learned about this place from an ancient text left by a predecessor, which mentioned the presence of a certain spiritual herb. Later, I managed to find this place, but last time, I only dared to follow the guidance of the ancient text and didn't dare to venture into other areas. Brother Qin, unless you're absolutely certain, it's best not to go deeper into the ice field."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He knew his limitations and wouldn't take risks in such a place.</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, Yun Youzi suddenly stopped. Qin Sang noticed a fissure open up in the ice field ahead, with glistening ice walls on both sides.</p><p>It was unknown how thick the ice layer was, but as far as Qin Sang could see, it was all ice.</p><p>"It's down there!"</p><p>Yun Youzi summoned his light and leaped into the crevice.</p><p>Seeing that Yun Youzi hadn't concealed himself and flew in openly, Qin Sang knew that there might be no danger within the crevice and followed him down without worry.</p><p>The two rapidly descended along the ice walls.</p><p>Not long after, Qin Sang suddenly heard the sound of rushing water. He and Yun Youzi stopped their descent, hovering in mid-air, and looked down.</p><p>Below was still a thick layer of ice, but strangely, a river flowed on top of the ice, unfrozen. The river's current was swift and its water crystal clear.</p><p>The riverbed was clearly visible, devoid of fish or shrimp.  Reflecting the surrounding ice, the water had a faint blue tint.</p><p>Then, Yun Youzi landed on the river surface, moving along the direction of the current.</p><p>‘Whoosh…'</p><p>They walked in a world of ice. Beneath the tranquil ice layer, only the sound of flowing water colliding with the ice could be heard, crisp and pleasant.</p><p>After traveling a certain distance, a silver light suddenly appeared ahead, followed by dozens of silver specks.</p><p>These silver lights moved erratically in the icy river. Under their illumination, the ice appeared even more bluish.</p><p>In a blue world, silver lights, like stars, jumped and chased each other…</p><p>The scene was extremely beautiful, like a dream.</p><p>From afar, the true nature of the silver lights couldn't be discerned. Qin Sang suddenly noticed that the moment the silver lights appeared, Yun Youzi's expression became serious. His heart tightened, realizing that the silver lights were not simple and might be very dangerous.</p><p>"Those silver lights are Flying Horned Fish-Dragons, a rare ancient beast."</p><p>Qin Sang heard Yun Youzi's voice transmission.</p><p>"The silver light is emitted from the lightning power condensed on their horns, and it's also their most proficient attack method. Last time, this old Daoist suddenly encountered them and suffered greatly before getting past them. Their numbers seem to have grown. Fortunately, I'm prepared this time…"</p><p>As he spoke, Yun Youzi rummaged through his belongings and took out a jade bottle.</p><p>The jade bottle contained a few drops of transparent liquid that looked like clear water. When the bottle was opened, a captivating fragrance emanated from it.</p><p>Yun Youzi tilted the bottle and carefully poured out a portion of the liquid.</p><p>The liquid flowed into the icy river and disappeared.</p><p>Yun Youzi capped the bottle, handed it to Qin Sang, and said confidently, "This old Daoist went back and searched through many ancient texts to find a way to deal with these Flying Horned Fish-Dragons, and concocted this bottle of Intoxicating Demon Saliva specifically for them. Just a few drops in the river will make them intoxicated for a short period. As long as we don't startle them, we can easily pass…"</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>The two proceeded silently, and soon saw the true appearance of the Flying Horned Fish-Dragons.</p><p>The icy river converged into a bottomless deep pool here. On the surface of the pool floated some ancient beasts shaped like salamanders. Their bodies were transparent, with their internal organs clearly visible.</p><p>The larger ones were several zhang long, and the smaller ones were about a zhang.</p><p>On top of their heads, they had a pointed tentacle, shaped like a single horn, from which the silver light emanated.</p><p>Arriving at the edge of the deep pool, Qin Sang could clearly sense the incredibly violent thunder power contained within the tentacles. Once released, it would undoubtedly cause terrifying destruction.</p><p>Even more frightening was that there were so many Flying Horned Fish-Dragons here!</p><p>Qin Sang secretly rejoiced that Yun Youzi hadn't exaggerated. The Intoxicating Demon Saliva was indeed remarkably effective. These Flying Horned Fish-Dragons were lying in the water like corpses, drifting with the current, truly intoxicated.</p><p>Recalling all the preparations Yun Youzi had made along the way, just gathering these spiritual ingredients was no easy feat. Qin Sang found it daunting just thinking about it, let alone refining them into various spiritual medicines.</p><p>No wonder Yun Youzi almost missed their appointed time.</p><p>Yun Youzi was overjoyed at the sight and urged, "Brother Qin, quickly enter the ice cave!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked over and saw an ice cave on the opposite bank of the deep pool. Knowing that the opportunity was fleeting, he immediately mounted his sword and rushed into the ice cave with Yun Youzi, one after the other.</p><p>The moment they flew over the deep pool, the effect of the Intoxicating Demon Saliva wore off. The Flying Horned Fish-Dragons turned over and continued playing happily, completely unaware that someone had just intruded into their territory.</p><p>…</p><p>The lush jungle remained unchanged.</p><p>The grey-robed figure appeared silently outside the jungle, his breathing somewhat hurried.</p><p>The jungle's end was visible at a glance. He examined the unusually calm jungle, a trace of suspicion flashing in his eyes.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, the grey-robed figure leaped into the jungle and stopped beneath the ancient tree where Qin Sang and Yun Youzi had previously stood.</p><p>Then, he began a meticulous search of the surrounding area.</p><p>No traces of battle…</p><p>No concealed restrictions or formations…</p><p>The suspicion on the grey-robed figure's face deepened, and a hint of anxiety emerged.</p><p>Suddenly, as if he had discovered something, the grey-robed figure abruptly turned around, his eyes fixed on the small grass beneath the ancient tree. The corners of his mouth curled up into a strange smile.</p>
