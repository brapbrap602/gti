<h1>Chapter 989: Escape</h1><p>Chapter 989: Escape</p><p>The sun blazed overhead.</p><p>A streak of light pierced the sky, as if chasing the rising sun.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>A crisp cracking sound echoed from his palm.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down; the high-grade spirit stone in his hand had shattered, its spiritual energy depleted.</p><p>He discarded the fragments, took out a vial of spirit pills, and was about to swallow one when he felt a sudden surge of unrest in his true essence. His expression changed slightly, and he hastily calmed the fluctuation.</p><p>This indicated that the impurities in his true essence had reached a critical point.</p><p>“It’s time to take the Three Lights Jade Liquid…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, taking out the jade vial.</p><p>He couldn't wait until the impurities accumulated to the point of destabilizing his true essence. Taking the Three Lights Jade Liquid in between would help refine some impurities, allowing him to hold out longer.</p><p>The liquid entered his stomach. Abundant and pure spiritual energy instantly filled his dantian, with the remaining potent medicinal power accumulating within his body.</p><p>Qin Sang felt his spirits lift, most of his fatigue dissipating.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>Dusk, then moonlit night.</p><p>Since being entangled by the fire curse, Qin Sang had been fleeing for nearly two days.</p><p>Two days without rest.</p><p>Qin Sang flew non-stop, Bai constantly trying various methods to seal or break the fire curse, while simultaneously maintaining the demonic fire net to prevent any leaked fluctuations from being detected by Old Demon Mu.</p><p>Both were exhausted, their energy greatly depleted.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang let out a muffled groan, his face turning pale.</p><p>His figure swayed violently, staggering as his遁光 plummeted, then bucked and weaved erratically over the sea's surface, nearly losing control and plunging into the water.</p><p>Bai was startled and looked up.</p><p>Noticing Bai's gaze, Qin Sang shook his head, signaling that he was fine, but delivered bad news.</p><p>“The sword spirit is shattered.”</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently in the direction his avatar had fled.</p><p>The shattered sword spirit meant his avatar had been caught by Old Demon Mu and self-destructed.</p><p>A splitting headache wracked Qin Sang. The sword spirit was equivalent to a part of his soul. Its self-destruction had repercussions; he felt a searing pain in his primordial spirit. Fortunately, Qin Sang had prepared spirit pills to nourish the primordial spirit. He quickly swallowed one, his complexion improving somewhat.</p><p>“He’s caught up, faster than expected…”</p><p>Bai’s voice was grave.  Mid-sentence, their expression changed, they let out an angry shout, rapidly striking Qin Sang with a series of hand seals.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang sensed something amiss.</p><p>The fire curse flared up again.</p><p>This time, the eruption was far more violent than before. Countless runes emerged from within him, glowing a brilliant blue, as if he were enveloped in blue flames.</p><p>At the same time, the demonic fire net manifested, but before Bai’s hand seals could be completed, the fire curse erupted with intense force.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The fire curse’s waves shattered the demonic fire net.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>…</p><p>Another area of the sea.</p><p>Old Demon Mu’s figure appeared beside a patch of blood mist, his expression utterly grim.</p><p>The blood mist was sealed in mid-air, like a large chunk of bloody amber suspended above the sea.</p><p>It was the result of the avatar's self-destruction.</p><p>Approaching the remains, Old Demon Mu sensed something amiss, rushing forward, but he was too late. The avatar had self-destructed before he arrived; only the dissipating blood mist remained when he reached the scene.</p><p>Body and soul, utterly destroyed.</p><p>Old Demon Mu searched the blood mist with his divine sense countless times, failing to find even a wisp of a remnant soul, let alone the treasure he sought.</p><p>However, everything indicated something was wrong. The lingering power of the fire curse was surprisingly weak.</p><p>Old Demon Mu, cunning and experienced, immediately understood.  The prey was far more cunning than he'd imagined.</p><p>He tried activating the fire curse, as usual, but felt nothing.</p><p>Old Demon Mu’s eyes narrowed. Suddenly, he tossed the winter flame upwards, his fingers spinning like wheels as he performed an extraordinarily complex incantation, pouring all his divine sense into the Winterfrost Cold Flame.</p><p>Simultaneously, Old Demon Mu’s face paled, and he spat out a mouthful of refined blood, which also merged into the flame.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The cold flame flared.</p><p>Instantly, a pillar of fire shot up from the flame, the entire column composed of intensely solidified fire curses, emitting powerful energy waves.</p><p>Old Demon Mu closed his eyes slightly, sensing for a moment before opening them, abruptly turning towards the southeast, a ferocious expression on his face.</p><p>“I meant to grant you a swift death…”</p><p>The bitter taste of misfortune was unpleasant.</p><p>Old Demon Mu had been supremely confident, only to be outwitted by his prey, fueling his rage to an inferno.</p><p>He was also filled with unanswered questions.</p><p>This ancient spell was unexpectedly obtained by him in the Seven Kills Hall. He later improved it, using the Winter Nether Cold Flame to cast it, making it more powerful and with a longer range than the original.</p><p>In the Canglang Sea cultivation world, he'd never heard of anyone else who knew this type of spell.</p><p>A mere Golden Core cultivator, not only understood the spell's function and immediately chose to flee, but also had a way to shield the spell's fluctuations, misleading his judgment.</p><p>Furthermore, after chasing for so long, even the powerful Old Devil Mou was feeling somewhat strained, his spiritual energy greatly depleted, and he'd already started using spirit stones and pills to replenish it.</p><p>The prey was still very much alive and kicking.</p><p>Old Devil Mou found himself intrigued by his prey.</p><p>To achieve this level of skill at the Golden Core stage... if he were allowed to grow, perhaps the cultivation world would see another legendary figure.</p><p>"What a pity..."</p><p>Old Devil Mou grinned cruelly, unleashing some unknown secret technique, transforming into a bloody shadow that tore through the air, his speed dramatically increasing.</p><p>...</p><p>After the Demon Fire Net was broken, Bai tried several times, all ending in failure.</p><p>"I have some leads now. Give me some more time, and I should be able to seal the fire spell!"</p><p>Bai hesitated for a moment, then said, "But this seal will only be temporary."</p><p>"What do you mean, friend?"</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly asked.</p><p>"During this time, I've had a vague idea, something I can try. It's to use my soul power, fusing it with the Demon Fire spell mark, to lay down a seal together. However, after the seal is completed, I must maintain it with all my strength. Once my soul power is depleted, the seal will no longer hold."</p><p>Bai sighed.</p><p>Qin Sang understood Bai's meaning.  Without a restorative elixir like the Three Lights Jade Liquid to replenish his soul, the seal's duration would be limited; the time Bai could buy wouldn't be enough for Qin Sang to reach the Storm Belt.</p><p>Just then, the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring on his wrist suddenly vibrated.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He looked down, taking the two-headed beast's jade pendant into his hand.</p><p>"Roar..."</p><p>The two-headed beast let out a roar, its eyes fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. "You're willing to act as bait to lure away Old Devil Mou, but in exchange, I must release your restraints and give you a Hegemonic Blood Fruit?"</p><p>The two-headed beast nodded its head slightly, its vertical pupils meeting Qin Sang's gaze.</p><p>Having spent so much time together, Qin Sang understood the two-headed beast well.</p><p>It was focused on escaping the control of the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring and regaining its freedom.  Even the Hegemonic Blood Fruit couldn't tempt it; it had even given up on breaking through to the late stage of the Core Transformation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the two-headed beast volunteered to be bait.</p><p>"This is the Canglang Sea, a cultivator's world. Have you thought this through?"</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly.</p>
