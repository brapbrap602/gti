Chapter 465: Temperament


Madam Jing chose her timing perfectly.
It was a close call.
"Excellent!"
Madam Jing offered a word of praise.
"I trust you, senior. I know you wouldn't harm me," Qin Sang said.


This wasn't entirely flattery.  In the Wen Yue Market, he'd learned of Madam Jing's temperament: she loathed those who were ungrateful or killed their companions.


Madam Jing chuckled, not commenting on Qin Sang's words. "Continue forward, Daoist Qin."


Under Madam Jing's guidance, Qin Sang ventured deeper into the forest. He couldn't fathom her purpose. Their path initially veered to the lower right, then continued straight to the right, before suddenly turning downwards – changing direction repeatedly.


Madam Jing kept her promise.  Whenever they encountered easily accessible starstones, she waited for Qin Sang to collect them before proceeding, delaying them only minimally.


Madam Jing's mastery of prohibition techniques was extraordinary.  Apart from unstable or layered prohibitions, any with flaws were instantly revealed to her.


Their journey was almost entirely unimpeded.


Qin Sang carefully considered Madam Jing's decisions, gaining considerable insight.


This forest was exceptionally vast.


After navigating countless dangerous prohibitions, they finally emerged from the forest. Seeing a tangled thicket ahead, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.  The thicket, though messy, was free of prohibitions, allowing him a moment's respite from tension.


Though only a short time – less than a quarter of an hour – had passed since entering Finger Heaven Peak, Qin Sang felt utterly exhausted. Those ancient prohibitions were incredibly complex.


Madam Jing instructed Qin Sang to cross the thicket. She sat cross-legged on his shoulder, seemingly sensing something, before flying up to survey the area.


The thicket was much smaller than the forest. Qin Sang quickly reached its edge and entered another forest.


This time, Madam Jing seemed to have a clear objective, directing Qin Sang straight to the lower right.


They encountered several more areas similar to the first forest, some densely packed with prohibitions, others sparsely but subtly protected – all easily bypassed by Madam Jing.


Jagged rocks towered all around.


It was a stone forest, devoid of vegetation, with bare stone pillars as tall as any ancient tree. Wind and sand had etched marks onto their surfaces.


It was hard to imagine how this landscape had formed.


A blizzard swirled through the stone forest, yet there was no chill.  The snowflakes were manifestations of broken prohibitions.  While seemingly a dense, impenetrable blizzard,  some spaces within the countless snowflakes remained untouched, though difficult to discern.


The Star Spirit Net descended, depositing two starstones into Qin Sang’s palm.  He then moved swiftly through the blizzard, appearing perilous but avoiding every snowflake.


After several quick movements, Qin Sang stopped, a look of surprise on his face. He glanced at Madam Jing.


A subtle fluctuation of spiritual energy had appeared ahead.


The fluctuation was fleeting, yet highly conspicuous within the prohibitions, instantly noticed by Qin Sang's sharp senses.


Someone was ahead!


This was the first person they'd encountered since entering Finger Heaven Peak.


"Continue,"


Madam Jing said flatly, showing no intention of detouring.


Qin Sang continued, but with greater caution and slower movements.


Another fluctuation of spiritual energy appeared, this time lasting longer. Qin Sang guessed the person was collecting starstones; the Soul Locking Bracelet was inefficient, making collection slow.


As they drew closer, Qin Sang guessed the person's identity.


Sensing Madam Jing's gaze, Qin Sang knew what she wanted to ask. Hesitating, he honestly replied, "It's Daoist Wei from the Ancient Will Sect."


The Ancient Will Sect, a major demonic sect in the Small Cold Region, was similar to the Green Sun Demon Sect; its disciples weren’t inherently vicious.


This person, surnamed Wei, was at the False Core stage and quite powerful.


Madam Jing hummed. "Bypass him."


Qin Sang sighed inwardly, feeling both disappointment and relief. Madam Jing hadn't changed.


It was unfortunate that it was someone from the Small Cold Region. If a Sky Walk Alliance opponent had blocked their path, Madam Jing would undoubtedly have intervened, even if she kept all the spoils. The body of a False Core cultivator would have been a significant gain.


Qin Sang no longer concealed his movements, accelerating through the snow.


A cultivator surnamed Wei quickly spotted Qin Sang. Clearly surprised to encounter someone else, he abandoned his collection of starstones.

Immediately, Qin Sang sensed a sharp intent directed at him – a warning.

Qin Sang remained silent and bypassed the cultivator.

At their closest point, only a few stone pillars separated them.  Snow obscured their vision, but not the spiritual energy fluctuations emanating from Qin Sang.

"Daoist Qin, is that you?"

The cultivator, surnamed Wei, couldn't help but ask, but received no reply.

He stood motionless, vigilant, and refrained from attacking, effectively ending any further thoughts Qin Sang might have had.

The snow fell heavily.

The two passed each other; a minor incident.

Unbeknownst to them, half an hour had passed.

Qin Sang had been silently calculating the time.  He had continuously collected starstones, his bag now more than half full.

After delivering Granny Jing to her destination and escaping, he could collect more.  Unless something unexpected happened, securing first place shouldn't be a problem.

He had spent most of his time traveling.  The speed at which his Star Spirit Net collected starstones was unimaginable to others.

For some reason, Granny Jing seemed to have become rather urgent.

After scaling a rock, a vast, seemingly endless canyon stretched before them.

This canyon, similar to Flying Peak, was a clear landmark.  They were now on the lower half of the mountainside, but already on the far side of the Finger Heaven Peak.

Half an hour, and they'd come this far.

The canyon was filled with a perpetually dense black mist, completely obscuring it.  From time to time, faint glimmers of light flickered within.

Qin Sang had just reached the canyon's edge and hadn't begun to observe it when he heard Granny Jing's command: "Jump!"

Her tone brooked no argument.  Qin Sang didn't know the reason for her urgency, nor would he ask.

He wasn't ready to die, and the fewer secrets he knew, the better.

The canyon wasn't very deep; Qin Sang landed after a short descent, but the ground was intensely cold.

Entering the canyon, he discovered countless hidden restrictions within the black mist, extremely well concealed. Without Granny Jing's guidance, Qin Sang wouldn't dare move freely here.

Following the canyon forward, the terrain sloped downwards, and the canyon seemed to deepen.

After traveling a considerable distance, Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He immediately suppressed his aura, his eyes fixed on the turbulent black mist ahead, quickly confirming it wasn't an illusion.

"Senior, it seems someone is ahead."
