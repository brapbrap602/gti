<h1>Chapter 1597: The Soul-Attracting Mirror</h1><p>The thousand-foot-long giant crocodile disintegrated, finally transforming into a blazing white light that shot back into its bone.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his true energy, reaching out to grasp the crocodile bone.</p><p>The bone trembled incessantly in his hand, the immense force giving Qin Sang the illusion that he was holding a ferocious beast struggling desperately.</p><p>Qin Sang sent out a wisp of his divine sense, probing into the bone. He perceived an extremely chaotic power, but no independent consciousness existed; there was no way to begin.</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang. He wondered how the crocodile demon had manipulated the bone.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang unleashed several strands of Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, creating a net of flames around the bone to barely suppress its power. He then gathered the remains and fled into the deep mountains.</p><p>Not far from where he took off,</p><p>a shadow suddenly appeared in the woods, trailing behind Qin Sang. The thin shadow moved between the treetops, light as air, cautiously maintaining a distance from him.</p><p>A figure was hidden within the shadow—the mysterious person who had earlier blocked the crocodile demon's escape route, the same one who had exposed the puppet crystal and the puppet's identity at the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>Without looking back, Qin Sang continued his flight, calmly asking, "Su Zinan is looking for me?"</p><p>The center of the shadow rose and fell slightly, vaguely revealing a humanoid silhouette. "Friend Daoist, are you unaware? I once heard that Su Zinan is searching for a mysterious individual who can control strange spirit flames, claiming that this person killed his elder, a deadly feud, an irreconcilable enmity! I initially dismissed it as nonsense, Su Zinan merely boasting, but upon seeing you today, I realize such understated experts truly exist..."</p><p>Suddenly, a silver glint flashed from the shadow, accompanied by a snort. "Your abilities are indeed extraordinary, Daoist Friend. However, I just witnessed the crocodile demon's tragic end; please don't use the same methods on me!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. He signaled his Heaven's Eye Butterfly to retract its abilities, ceasing to observe the other.</p><p>The other person blocked the Heaven's Eye ability with a silver cloak, preventing Qin Sang from seeing their face.</p><p>Exposed, Qin Sang showed no shame, replying with a touch of sarcasm, "Even the Nascent Soul cultivators are gone, what are you afraid of, Lu Ye?"</p><p>He was puzzled.</p><p>In the Snowfield battle, only the Moon Princess had 'died'.</p><p>If Su Zinan claimed revenge for his beloved concubine, it would be understandable.  Elder Wu was merely forced to retreat and remains alive and well; where did this slain elder come from?</p><p>There was only one explanation.</p><p>Su Zinan highly valued the Water Phase Master's relic and was using this as an excuse to hunt him.</p><p>"Really gone?"</p><p>The figure in the shadow did not dwell on the unpleasantness, falling silent for a moment before asking with an ambiguous tone.</p><p>Qin Sang could not answer.</p><p>Various signs in the cultivation world, and the clues given to him by the Moon Princess, suggested that the Nascent Soul cultivators were most likely missing.</p><p>But there was no definitive proof; why did they disappear, where did they go?</p><p>Were they trapped in the Wuwang Palace? What kind of restriction could trap those Nascent Soul cultivators for hundreds of years, with no way out?</p><p>Qin Sang felt a gaze fall upon the demon pill in his hand.</p><p>"Transformed demons entering Central Plains together is unusual. Let's ask what they're looking for. If I remember correctly, the demon race also has a Saint King!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, saying, "Good!"</p><p>The two flew silently for a while, away from Tianzhong County, before landing on a deserted mountain. Qin Sang brought out the demon pill, using coercion and enticement. However, the crocodile demon was incredibly tenacious, almost finding an opportunity to self-destruct.</p><p>Ultimately, unwilling to waste time, they joined forces to perform soul-searching.</p><p>The higher a cultivator's realm, the more difficult soul-searching becomes, and this applies to demons as well.</p><p>Although both Qin Sang and the figure in the shadow were of higher cultivation than the crocodile demon, and Qin Sang possessed exceptional divine sense, the soul-searching process was arduous, yielding only fragmented memories.</p><p>The crocodile demon's essence dissipated.</p><p>Fortunately, they obtained what they sought.</p><p>More than three demons entered the Central Plains; other great demons infiltrated the human cultivation world, even attempting to destroy the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>The Saint King Palace had split. They were former subordinates of the demon Saint King, their purpose being to find the Saint King's whereabouts!</p><p>The demon Saint King was also missing!</p><p>Before the demon Saint King's disappearance, a human cultivator visited the Saint King Palace; the demons suspected the Saint King was murdered by humans!</p><p>Unfortunately, the green-furred rat demon was the true confidant of the Saint King; the crocodile demon knew little. The figure in the shadow slightly regretted not helping Qin Sang capture the green-furred rat demon.</p><p>Besides this, Qin Sang also discovered the origin of the crocodile bone.</p><p>The two crocodile demons were originally brothers. During their cultivation, they awakened different bloodline abilities, leading to changes in their appearance and making them vastly different.</p><p>They unexpectedly discovered a crocodile bone, suspected to be the remains of an ancient, monstrous crocodile, radiating a ferocious aura.  It resonated with their bloodline, allowing them to control it using their bloodline power.</p><p>Qin Sang, though cultivating the *Tianyao Lianxing* technique, lacked the crocodile bloodline and thus couldn't gain the bone's acceptance.</p><p>Both fell silent.</p><p>Few beings in the world could threaten cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage. Only a handful of ancient realms posed such a threat, now joined by the beasts of the storm zone.</p><p>What earth-shattering event had alarmed two clans of Nascent Soul cultivators?  And how were such powerful cultivators unaware?</p><p>All speculation paled before the shocking, terrifying reality.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the second crocodile corpse and its core between them.  "This demon's slaying is thanks in part to a fellow Daoist."</p><p>The figure from the shadows chuckled.  "I merely seized an opportunity, dealing a negligible blow.  All credit goes to your profound abilities. I'm unworthy of a share; consider it a gift."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. "I cannot accept ungiven gifts... Fellow Daoist, state your purpose. I have urgent matters and cannot stay long."</p><p>"At the Treasure Exchange, I made it clear: I wish to trade with you, obtaining the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal you possess," the shadowed figure said gravely.  He had closely followed Qin Sang after seeing the crystal.</p><p>"Why conduct this trade in the open?"  Qin Sang was puzzled. The crystal was useless to him, and the auction had few competitors; a high enough bid would have secured it.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, examine this treasure..."</p><p>A fissure opened in the shadows, releasing a silvery orb containing a net rolled into a ball.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The orb unfurled, revealing a faintly visible silver net, alternately solidifying and dissolving into ethereal threads, seemingly merging with the void.  It was quite extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the net, his expression shifting, then softly exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>"You recognize it?"</p><p>The shadowed figure replied, "This is the Thousand Knot Divine Net, a rare treasure for spiritual cultivators.  When infused with spiritual sense, it merges with the user's consciousness, enhancing its power and range. With sufficient spiritual power, even non-spiritual cultivators can wield its great strength."</p><p>As the shadowed figure said, purely spiritual cultivator treasures were extremely rare.  Whether the jade Buddha qualified was uncertain. Qin Sang, throughout his cultivation, had encountered few such items.</p><p>"While it won't improve your cultivation, it's undeniably one of the best treasures for spiritual cultivators. Such items are invaluable, and the Thousand Knot Net in exchange for your crystal is a fair trade," the shadowed figure declared confidently.</p><p>Offering this treasure was painful, but the crystal was more important.  Since Qin Sang refused other items, the shadowed figure had no alternative.</p><p>Hearing the net's function, Qin Sang's heart quickened! He hadn't yet tested the dragon's saliva, unsure of its effects or refinement time. The net's ability to refine and enhance spiritual sense offered immediate results, potentially improving the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique and bolstering his advantage in future confrontations.</p><p>Qin Sang, now inclined to trade, calmly said, "This treasure has a complicated history, doesn't it?"</p><p>The Treasure Exchange's formation blocked sound transmission to prevent collusion.  This person had transmitted to him during the brief moment when Jiang You relaxed the formation, allowing everyone to inspect the treasures.  He'd done so before many top-tier experts without being discovered.</p><p>The shadowed figure chuckled nervously. "The Thousand Knot Net belonged to an elder of the Qiongying Sect... At the auction, the Qiongying Sect's Grand Elder sat below.  You understand why I request this trade elsewhere, right?"</p><p>"The Qiongying Sect's Grand Elder!" Qin Sang immediately recalled someone. "The cultivator who purchased the *Soul-Binding Technique*?"</p><p>"Yes," the shadowed figure said, reluctant to elaborate.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's thoughtful silence, he goaded, "Are you afraid of the Qiongying Sect, afraid to claim the net?"</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed.  "Its rarity is its strength. Its true worth might not exceed that of an Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal from an ancient realm.  However, you aided me in slaying the demon, so I won't quibble. The crystal is yours!"</p><p>Two beams of light shot from his Qianjun ring – a puppet and a crystal.  Simultaneously, Qin Sang reached for the Thousand Knot Net.</p><p>The shadows writhed, a tentacle snatching both treasures before retreating into the darkness like a tide, leaving behind a hearty laugh. "Until we meet again!"</p><p>Night fell, a deep and starless expanse.  The night wind whispered, the forest swaying as if countless specters hid in the shadows – and the shadows vanished without a trace, as if they never existed.  Qin Sang paused before melting into the darkness.</p><p>...</p><p>The Treasure Exchange witnessed an unexpected farce: a demon cultivator infiltrated the event and openly ambushed cultivators outside.</p><p>The demonic cultivators failed in their attempt, suffering the loss of two powerful demons; a disastrous defeat.  This caused considerable embarrassment and anger within the Six States Hall.</p><p>They had stated beforehand that due to strict instructions from their superiors, they could only guarantee safety at the Treasure Exchange Fair.  Everyone attending the Fair was well aware of this.</p><p>If the human cultivators had fought amongst themselves, the Six States Hall would not have been held responsible.</p><p>However, the involvement of demonic cultivators, which the Six States Hall failed to detect, nearly turned them into a laughingstock, hence their anger.</p><p>But they didn't know who to hold accountable for their humiliation.</p><p>After the Green-furred Rat Demon escaped, someone secretly followed it, rallying others, attempting a hunt in the Central Plains. However, the demon's abilities were incredibly cunning; it vanished without a trace, disappearing from the encirclement.</p><p>In the following period, more demonic activity was reported in the Central Plains.</p><p>Rumors of the Demon King's whereabouts spread like wildfire, their origin unknown.</p><p>…</p><p>Eight Scenery Peak.</p><p>The Zhenjun Daoist Temple, leader of the Central States Daoist schools.</p><p>In the public imagination, Eight Scenery Peak should be a sprawling complex, with countless palaces, disciples beyond number, and immense power – the preeminent Daoist sect.</p><p>In reality, Eight Scenery Peak is an ordinary temple situated in Jiangzhou, one of the six states of the Jiang region.</p><p>Jiangzhou’s terrain is seven parts mountains, three parts water.</p><p>Unlike the treacherous mountains and rivers of the Southern Barbarians, Jiangzhou boasts beautiful mountains and landscapes.</p><p>Eight Scenery Peak lies deep within the mountains, on an unremarkable peak, less than a thousand meters high. Its size is comparable to any ordinary temple. Nestled amongst the trees, it’s a supremely peaceful place.</p><p>In fact, Eight Scenery Peak's protective formation only covers the mountain itself.</p><p>As the foremost Daoist sect in the Central States, Eight Scenery Peak has countless disciples. It's impossible for them all to live on one mountain; those who have reached sufficient cultivation may choose a secluded cave anywhere in the surrounding mountains.</p><p>The mountains are filled with Eight Scenery Peak disciples!</p><p>Early morning.</p><p>A thick night fog lingered, dew drops clinging to the leaves, reflecting the morning sun in myriad sparkling points.</p><p>A figure swiftly approached, slowing as it neared Eight Scenery Peak, then descending onto the stone steps in a show of respect.  </p><p>The newcomer was a young Daoist.</p><p>He touched his face, his features instantly shifting, revealing him to be Crane-Gao Zhenren!</p><p>Few people were in the temple.  Apart from the disciples attending to the Zhenjun and the Master, others rarely came, preferring not to disturb the cultivation.</p><p>The sun rose, bringing with it purple auspicious clouds.</p><p>Disciples were gathered in small groups on the mountaintop, practicing their breathing techniques and diligently cultivating.</p><p>Without guidance, Crane-Gao Zhenren, familiar with the layout, went directly to the last building, a simple wooden palace.</p><p>A slender Daoist stood guard. Seeing Crane-Gao Zhenren, he bowed respectfully: "Greetings, Uncle Master."</p><p>Crane-Gao Zhenren opened his mouth to speak, but a gentle voice from within the hall interrupted: "Junior Brother is back. Come in."</p><p>The slender Daoist stepped aside, and Crane-Gao Zhenren entered, finding the current head of Eight Scenery Peak – Purple Thunder Zhenren.</p><p>"Senior Brother, are your wounds healed?"</p><p>Crane-Gao Zhenren asked with concern.</p><p>Purple Thunder Zhenren, his back to him, was studying something on his desk, nodding slightly.</p><p>Crane-Gao Zhenren was overjoyed. He then recounted the events of the Treasure Exchange Fair:  “…Senior Brother's insight was sharp; that person was indeed suspicious, surely a remnant of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect!  They were buying up五行破禁之宝 at the Fair; their intentions were grand…"</p><p>While speaking, Crane-Gao Zhenren noticed the Master's strange behavior. He stepped closer, seeing an ancient, green mirror on the desk.</p><p>He recognized the mirror immediately.</p><p>This was a Soul-Guiding Mirror, similar in function to a Soul Lamp, used to observe the fortune of a specific person.</p><p>Due to its high refinement difficulty, only a few in Eight Scenery Peak possessed a Soul-Guiding Mirror; others had to make do with ordinary Soul Lamps.</p><p>This mirror was heavily cracked, almost shattered!</p><p>Crane-Gao Zhenren gasped, his face turning pale. "Which junior disciple has met with misfortune?"</p><p>Purple Thunder Zhenren replied quietly:  "Dan Yu Shishu."</p><p>"Uncle Master…"</p><p>Crane-Gao Zhenren's eyes widened in disbelief. He stumbled back, "Impossible! When?  During the Northern Sea hunt, Senior Brother didn’t you use Uncle Master’s decree…"</p><p>"I forged it,"</p><p>Purple Thunder Zhenren sighed inaudibly, a hint of relief in his tone.  The burden he’d carried alone was finally shared.</p><p>Silence filled the hall.  The sigh, though soft, struck Crane-Gao Zhenren like a thunderbolt.</p>
