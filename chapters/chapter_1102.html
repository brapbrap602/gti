<h1>Chapter 1994: Return</h1><p>Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Ancient sword hall.</p><p>A teleportation array, dormant for a century, suddenly glowed faintly.</p><p>The light flickered.</p><p>Soon, a figure materialized on the array, stumbling slightly before steadying themselves by grasping a stone pillar at the edge.</p><p>Qin Sang, pale-faced, shook his head.  Seeing the familiar surroundings, a look of emotion crossed his features.</p><p>The ancient hall.</p><p>The altar.</p><p>The spirit array.</p><p>After more than a hundred years, he had finally returned. This time, he experienced the teleportation while conscious, making it a far more visceral experience. Even with his current cultivation, he felt dizzy and disoriented, even experiencing the sensation of his body being torn apart. The spatial impact and pressure during the teleportation were incomparable to the ancient array in the Shangyuan Quiet Palace.</p><p>He silently circulated his cultivation techniques, gradually recovering.</p><p>His breathing steadied.</p><p>Looking down, Qin Sang saw that the pillar he was leaning on was the very one left behind by Elder Qingzhu years ago.  Seeing the two incomplete killing talismans on it, Qin Sang was momentarily stunned.</p><p>Back then, Elder Qingzhu was still alive, yet fate had cruelly kept them apart. When they finally met, it was only to be their last.</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked the Qianjun Ring on his finger. Elder Qingzhu's remains rested within.</p><p>In the Nether Valley, Qin Sang had found Elder Qingzhu's body, peacefully passed away beneath a peach tree.  Following the elder's wishes, he had prepared an ice coffin and brought the body back to be interred in the place described in Elder Qingzhu's death poem—the elder's hometown.</p><p>This place wasn't within a cultivation sect; like Xiaohua Mountain, it lay on the edge of the Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>After the burial, Qin Sang carefully set up protective restrictions in the Nether Valley to safeguard the peach tree, preventing it from being eroded by the Nether Qi. He wished for the peach blossoms to bloom eternally.</p><p>There was also Elder Qingzhu's death poem etched on a cliff face—a top-tier sword manual embodying the elder's lifelong understanding of the sword and the art of killing.  For Qin Sang, who cultivated the same technique, it was an invaluable treasure!</p><p>Filled with gratitude, Qin Sang paid his respects to Qingzhu before carefully committing the sword manual to memory and copying it onto a jade slip. He removed the fragment of the killing sword, leaving the inscription on the cliff untouched.  This was Elder Qingzhu's final mark on the world. But Qin Sang would carry on the elder's legacy, continuing to move forward.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's heart stirred.  A fragment of the killing sword appeared in his palm.  Because of the complete "kill" character on the fragment, Qin Sang called it the Killing Sword.</p><p>Looking down at the character, Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.  Though damaged, the sword fragment still emanated a strange, compelling aura that affected his mind.  The intact Killing Sword must have been an unimaginable treasure for the cultivators of this world!</p><p>When Qin Sang obtained the fragment, the gray energy of the sword spirit shot into it.  Remembering Elder Qingzhu's words, Qin Sang didn't intervene.</p><p>Of course, he hadn't forgotten the elder's warning. Before the sword spirit awakened, its nature was unknown; he had to be prepared for the possibility of it turning against him.</p><p>However, after the sword spirit entered the fragment, Qin Sang regretted his decision.  In the Nascent Soul stage, Elder Qingzhu could barely wield the fragment; it was this treasure that allowed him to severely wound Leng Yuntian after being discovered by Leng Qian.</p><p>But after the sword spirit's integration, Qin Sang found a strange resistance when trying to activate the fragment.  It was undoubtedly related to the sleeping sword spirit.  He couldn't tell if the spirit was subconsciously resisting or using the Killing Sword's power to nurture itself.</p><p>Forcing the spirit out would be difficult.  Weighing the pros and cons, Qin Sang chose to let it be, as he wasn't lacking for trump cards. The sword spirit would recover faster within the fragment; an earlier awakening meant it could help him find other fragments and cultivation techniques sooner.</p><p>Now, the fragment was being nurtured within his energy sea.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious about the Killing Sword's origins.  The sword shattered, and the "Chapter on Nurturing Swords with the Yuan Shen" was also torn apart.  The fragments were hidden in the same place. Cultivators who mastered the technique could wield the fragments, indicating a close relationship between the two.  What would it be like when he obtained the complete technique and restored the Killing Sword's power?</p><p>"Purple Micro Palace… Seven Killing Hall…"</p><p>These two hidden realms flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that if Qisha Hall was once a powerful immortal sect, the "Meta-Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter" was likely its most treasured cultivation technique.  The Celestial Tower, Yitian Peak, and the lingering sword intent all served as evidence.  Ziwei Palace also had intricate connections to them.  He obtained the first part of the technique and the sword spirit within Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang suspected that these two secret realms might not be the only ones; perhaps other fragments existed in other cultivation worlds. If these cultivation worlds were all surrounded by endless storms, finding them one by one would be extremely difficult.  The two locations were connected by a teleportation array. After he formed his Nascent Soul, he absolutely must explore thoroughly and search for clues.</p><p>Among them, what most captivated Qin Sang was undoubtedly the shadow of the immortal palace within Qisha Hall's immortal restriction. Unlike the chaotic and desolate Qisha Hall, the immortal palace appeared complete, ethereal, and awe-inspiring.  Elder Qingzhu, simply by searching along the jade corridor, found a top-tier divine talisman, the small relocation talisman, now extinct in the world.  It's conceivable how many treasures were hidden within that immortal palace!</p><p>He was the only cultivator who knew how to enter the immortal restriction, but the jade corridor did not directly connect to the immortal palace; further exploration was required. After properly laying Qingzhu's body to rest, Qin Sang returned to the immortal restriction, found the path hidden by Elder Qingzhu on the jade corridor, used talismans to clear the way, and located the ancient teleportation array within the immortal restriction.</p><p>He had wanted to look for other paths within the restriction, but after successive battles in the trial realm and Yitian Peak, time did not permit it.  The immortal restriction showed fluctuations. In a short time, both Qisha Hall and Ziwei Palace would be sealed.  Leaving Ziwei Palace didn't require the Beichen Star Yuan Array; when Ziwei Palace sealed, the outer immortal array would pause momentarily, the vortex briefly calming, providing cultivators with a fleeting opportunity to escape.</p><p>Before leaving, he still had a few things to do.</p><p>"How are you doing?"</p><p>Qin Sang sent a voice transmission to Bai.</p><p>He adjusted his state.</p><p>He didn't know what the situation in Xiao Han Domain had become; he had to be extremely careful. If the ancient demons summoned by the Zu Yuan were as terrifying as the Demon Lord suppressed beneath Yitian Peak, Xiao Han Domain and the Tianxing League might already be devastated. He could only take the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid, hide, and cultivate, waiting for the next opening of Ziwei Palace to escape back to Canglang Sea.</p><p>However, with the successive deaths of top experts from both the human and witch races, Canglang Sea would probably not be peaceful either. Qin Sang took out the token given to him by the successor of the Four Saints Palace, thoughtfully.  Nan Gui Xianzi had mentioned that there were Nascent Soul stage cultivators among the Four Saints.  Since the Four Saints Palace was a Nascent Soul lineage, forming ties with them wasn't a bad thing. In the future, when the opportunity arose, he should definitely pay them a visit; it might help him solve many of his questions. (Happy New Year everyone!)</p>
