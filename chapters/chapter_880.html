<h1>Chapter 872: Fruitless Search</h1><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang set up layers of restrictions and a defensive spirit array before finally relaxing.</p><p>Then, he sat cross-legged in front of his avatar, pricked his fingertip, and forced out his lifeblood, performing a blood-feeding technique.</p><p>After swallowing the lifeblood, the avatar's face flushed, his aura suddenly surged, and then gradually stabilized.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, thought for a moment, and, as before, forced out a few more drops of blood, injecting them into the avatar's body for him to slowly refine. He then sealed the cave and quietly left.</p><p>……</p><p>Several months later, Qin Sang returned to this sea region.</p><p>He first went back to Thunder Island.</p><p>The island was lush and green. The place where the Kui Dragon's blood had sprayed was particularly vibrant, and the traces of the battle had long since been covered.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in front of a mountain, looking around, recalling the events of that day. The Kui Dragon had come from the clouds. After discovering that the Kui Dragon was under attack, those people had arrived to support it quickly, indicating that their cave shouldn't be too far away.</p><p>In case any of the Black Serpent Mountain cultivators hadn't left, Qin Sang proceeded cautiously.</p><p>He spent more than half a month, practically combing through all the surrounding islands, but to his surprise, he found no trace.</p><p>Not to mention a cave, he couldn't even find an island with a spirit vein.</p><p>Unwilling to give up, Qin Sang had the Sky Eye Butterfly constantly activate its Sky Eye, searching even more carefully, but the result was the same.</p><p>The mysterious cultivators were like phantoms.</p><p>"Could those people have come through a teleportation array? Or is their cave's concealment formation so powerful that even the Sky Eye Butterfly was fooled?"</p><p>Qin Sang expanded his search range, even diving beneath the surface to look for submerged islands, but still found nothing.</p><p>For such a long time, there had been no sign of activity from Black Serpent Mountain either.</p><p>Helpless, Qin Sang could only temporarily give up, planning to wait until the Demonic Sea returned to normal before hunting down Black Serpent Mountain disciples, seeking revenge and gathering information at the same time.</p><p>Having made up his mind, Qin Sang withdrew from this sea region and returned to Orchid Island.</p><p>……</p><p>Marketplace.</p><p>The avatar was diligently cultivating, his cultivation progressing rapidly, already having broken through to the seventh level of Qi Refining.</p><p>"Even faster than when I used Soul Pills..."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, not idling either, busying himself with his own affairs.</p><p>Beams of light fell upon various parts of the cave, almost filling it in the blink of an eye, leaving the avatar to cultivate in a corner.</p><p>Qin Sang's fingers flickered, guiding these beams of light, quickly arranging them into a large formation. Then, he flipped his palm, revealing three jade boxes.</p><p>The high-grade spirit stones had been gathered, and he could finally refine the remaining black iron pillars into flagpoles.</p><p>Anticipation flickered in Qin Sang's eyes. With the flagpoles refined, the preparations for crafting the Ten Yama Banners would be complete. He would possess a top-grade magical treasure once the Seven Killing Palace opened.</p><p>Moreover, his refining skills would also make a leap during the process of refining the flagpoles.</p><p>The black iron pillars contained extremely intricate restrictions. Even if he could only comprehend a small part of them, it would be enough to make Qin Sang comparable to renowned refining masters.</p><p>Three high-grade spirit stones were arranged in a row.</p><p>With the spirit array completed, Qin Sang added another layer of isolating restrictions outside. He then took out the black iron pillars, placed them in the center of the spirit array, and then struck one of the high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>This second refining attempt was clearly much more proficient than the last time, utilizing the spirit stones more efficiently.</p><p>Before long, the black iron pillars began to 'melt.' Qin Sang's expression turned serious, and he flicked out a jade bottle containing sealed demonic beast souls.</p><p>Thanks to his previous improvement in refining techniques, Qin Sang was adept, and the refining process went very smoothly. One flagpole gradually took shape.</p><p>Then the second, the third...</p><p>More and more sections were separated, and the main body of the black iron pillar became smaller and smaller, eventually leaving only a small lump, which was refined into the last flagpole.</p><p>'Condense!'</p><p>Qin Sang shouted in a low voice, and a light swept across the flagpole, finally solidifying its form.</p><p>Beside him were fourteen flagpoles.  Along with the last one, there were exactly fifteen!</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy. He beckoned them into his palm, intending to examine them, when he suddenly heard a crisp sound. He looked and saw that the high-grade spirit stone at the center of the spirit array had shattered.</p><p>The spiritual power within the spirit stone had been depleted, completely consumed.</p><p>As he had anticipated, this was the third high-grade spirit stone used, just enough to sustain him in refining the black iron pillars.</p><p>"Fifteen flagpoles are complete..."</p><p>Qin Sang held the flagpoles together, discovering that their energies were still connected, as if they were one. This was because during the refining process, he had only cleverly separated the black iron pillars without damaging the restrictions within.</p><p>It wasn't that he didn't want to, but rather that he couldn't.</p><p>Even Old Ancestor Kui Yin couldn't do it. After a hundred years of contemplation, and because the black iron pillar was already broken into two sections, he had a flash of inspiration and thought of this clever method.</p><p>"It's a pity that the other Yama Banners are nowhere to be found. Otherwise, if all the flagpoles were gathered, it might be possible to restore the black iron pillar. This kind of treasure doesn't seem like something ordinary people can refine.  Even Old Ancestor Kui Yin couldn't comprehend the restrictions within. It's very likely an ancient treasure left by an ancient mighty figure. If the black iron pillar could be restored, who knows how powerful it would be. Now, refining the Ten Yama Banners, although it's a top-grade magical treasure, is still a waste of its potential..."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>The Kui Yin Sect had rumors that Old Ancestor Kui Yin had failed during his tribulation, resulting in the destruction of five of the flagpoles. But Qin Sang felt that the black iron pillar had an extraordinary origin. The Nascent Soul tribulation shouldn't have destroyed the flagpoles; they were just lost somewhere.</p><p>Now, the Kui Yin Sect had been destroyed for over a hundred years.</p><p>Before he left, Small Cold Region, the Heavenly Alliance, and the Abyss of Sin were on the verge of war. He didn't know what had become of them now. Even if he returned to Small Cold Region, the hope of gathering all the flagpoles was slim.</p><p>"Forget it, I shouldn't overthink it! A top-grade magical treasure is already something most cultivators wouldn't dare to dream of. Even if it's not a supreme treasure left by an ancient mighty figure, but just a legendary spiritual treasure above magical treasures, it's still extremely rare in the world. With my strength, I can't even activate it, only look at it."</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts, and after checking that the flagpoles were flawless, he carefully stored them away. Then, he calmed his mind and entered meditation, reflecting on what he had gained from refining the flagpoles.</p><p>The restrictions within the black iron pillar were mysterious and vast, giving Qin Sang a sense of insignificance.</p><p>This kind of comprehension wasn't something that could be achieved overnight.</p><p>At noon the next day, Qin Sang awoke from his meditation, excitement and confusion intertwined in his eyes. He had only comprehended a shallow layer. He lowered his head and pondered for a moment before stepping out of the cave.</p><p>He rented a shop in the marketplace, put up a refining sign, and prepared to settle down here.</p><p>He would cultivate his Star Tempering Body and refining skills, comprehend the black iron pillar's restrictions, and befriend local cultivators to inquire about the Orchid Island Sect.  His avatar could also cultivate peacefully, without delaying anything.</p><p>The small shop opened for business.</p><p>Qin Sang hired someone to watch the shop while he frequently traveled back and forth between the shop and the cave.</p><p>Thanks to his superb refining skills, even without the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the magical tools he refined were more powerful than others', and his reputation quickly spread.</p>
