<h1>第一千四百六十一章 灵宝之威（4k，二合一）</h1><p>Seeing Qin Sang's skeptical expression, Tong Lingyu explained, "Regarding the sea chart, there are indeed rumors in the North Sea, saying that the journey is extremely long, but even late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators can rely on the sea chart to travel through the storm belt and reach Central Continent. Your strength is high, and your vision is no longer limited to the Four Domains of the North Sea, viewing the storm belt as a prison. Therefore, you began to search for the sea chart, wanting to go outside and seek the Great Dao (Grand Path). Our Palace Master's heart for the Dao is no less than yours. If she had the sea chart, she would have already set off."</p><p>Saying this, she smiled and said, "If Profound Heaven Palace controlled the sea chart, there would be no need to hide it. When top experts like you come to the door, they would definitely fulfill your requests, provided you swear not to lead foreign domain experts to cause chaos in the North Sea. You are unwilling to be content with a corner and actively leave the North Sea. Wouldn't that be a good thing for Profound Heaven Palace?"</p><p>This statement was indeed true.</p><p>Profound Heaven Palace was a behemoth dominating a domain (realm), the number one power in the Four Domains of the North Sea.</p><p>If all the demon grand sages and human great cultivators in the late stage of Transformation left the North Sea to travel, the lack of instability would mean that no one or any power could threaten Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally understood this principle.</p><p>He had previously suspected that Ghost Mother's purpose in infiltrating Profound Heaven Palace might not be the sea chart, or not solely the sea chart.</p><p>"Where did the rumors come from?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked in reply.</p><p>There must be a reason for groundless rumors.</p><p>Both the Palace Master and Great Elder of Profound Heaven Palace had heard the rumors, coupled with the sea chart that Ghost Mother obtained in Pure Sea Sect, it was evident that someone had previously traveled between Central Continent and the North Sea.</p><p>"It's untraceable now," Tong Lingyu shook her head. "If Daoist Qin receives good news in the future, please don't forget Profound Heaven Palace. We will definitely reward you handsomely. If this palace has the good fortune to break through to the late stage of Nascent Soul, I also want to travel and see the scenery outside the North Sea."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled lightly.</p><p>Profound Heaven Palace couldn't find it; what good methods could he, an outsider, have?</p><p>At least, there were no rumors of a sea chart in Northern Chen Domain.</p><p>Could he only start with Pure Sea Sect?</p><p>Qin Sang sank into thought, but because Ghost Mother was involved, he did not reveal the matter of Pure Sea Sect to Tong Lingyu. He planned to investigate on his own when he had time.</p><p>He had only just broken through to the mid-stage of Nascent Soul not long ago. He had plenty of time and wasn't in a hurry.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, Tong Lingyu probed, "Daoist Qin, we have already shown our sincerity. I wonder..."</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head, swept his palm across his waist, and a jade ice box appeared in his palm.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's beautiful eyes lit up, staring at the ice box for a long time. Seeing that the seal was intact, she secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Previously, when Liuli extracted the power of the Ice Demon Crystal, it had not damaged the seal. The changes were not visible from the outside, and only opening the ice box would reveal it.</p><p>"Since Daoist Tong has treated me with courtesy, Qin will not push his luck."</p><p>Qin Sang held the ice box in his palm, allowing Tong Lingyu to examine it carefully. "After coming out of your sect's treasure vault, Qin will immediately offer this item with both hands! However, Qin has another request..."</p><p>Tong Lingyu had already revealed a smile, but hearing the change in Qin Sang's tone, as if he wanted to add more conditions, her expression slightly darkened.</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "Qin has long admired Profound Heaven Palace and Daoist Tong. Today, the opportunity is rare, and I want to ask for some guidance, to see the legendary Spiritual Treasure. I wonder what Daoist Tong thinks?"</p><p>His true purpose was to experience the true power of a Spiritual Treasure.</p><p>He didn't know if the Demon Suppression Monument of Seven Killing Hall was a Spiritual Treasure.</p><p>Besides the Demon Suppression Monument, this was the first opportunity Qin Sang had to face a Spiritual Treasure directly since he started cultivating.</p><p>In Void Spirit Sect, Qin Sang had seen some textual descriptions in the classics, such as Spiritual Treasures not having ranks, and the power of different Spiritual Treasures could vary greatly, and so on.</p><p>But none of them were as direct as experiencing it personally.</p><p>He had already made preparations on the island. Even if Tong Lingyu had malicious intentions, he could escape at any time. As for his own methods, the demonic flame had already been exposed, so he could fight to his heart's content.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was somewhat surprised to hear this.</p><p>For experts of this level, they would not actively provoke unnecessary fights. There must be some kind of plot. It turned out to be for the Spiritual Treasure.</p><p>Profound Heaven Palace had a Spiritual Treasure inheritance, which was not a secret among top experts.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Tong Lingyu said, "Daoist Qin killed the traitor of Profound Heaven Palace and helped Profound Heaven Palace recover the sacred object, so he is a friend of Profound Heaven Palace. Swords and blades have no eyes. If we accidentally fail to stop in time during our exchange, it would inevitably harm our harmony. How about we limit it to three moves, stopping when we have made our point?"</p><p>Qin Sang heard the implication, and a strange look flashed in his eyes.</p><p>This Great Elder was worried that her attack would be too heavy and hurt him!</p><p>Was the power of a Spiritual Treasure really that strong?</p><p>If he hadn't displayed extraordinary escape techniques that surpassed those of a Great Cultivator, Tong Lingyu probably wouldn't have easily agreed to these conditions.</p><p>Qin Sang understood in his heart, took a deep look at Tong Lingyu, became even more curious about the Spiritual Treasure, turned his hand to put away the ice box, and said, "Good! I will follow Daoist Tong's words!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu nodded with a smile, turned to look at Liuli, "Liuli, you will stand guard for Daoist Qin and me."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Liuli drove her escape light and flew to the periphery, turning to look at this side.</p><p>An exchange between two top experts might involve Spiritual Treasures. Having the opportunity to observe would also be a great opportunity for her.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tong Lingyu looked at each other and flew out of the small island at the same time, hovering in mid-air.</p><p>Without any concealment, Qin Sang waved his hand and summoned the demonic banner.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Demonic flames soared into the sky.</p><p>A black flame dragon spiraled in the high sky, then swooped down, swimming around Qin Sang, majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the demonic flames, his expression calm and ready.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's gaze was attracted by the demonic flames. Feeling the power emanating from the demonic flames, the strangeness in her expression grew stronger, and she couldn't help but take another look at Qin Sang.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment.</p><p>Tong Lingyu did not take out a magic weapon or Spiritual Treasure as Qin Sang had expected.</p><p>She clasped her hands together, looked at Qin Sang, and chanted something in her mouth.</p><p>With her movements, Qin Sang suddenly felt a chill rise from nowhere, rushing towards him. In the blink of an eye, it was everywhere, in all directions.</p><p>"Not a magic weapon, some kind of Dao technique..."</p><p>Qin Sang saw the method Tong Lingyu was using and couldn't help but feel a little disappointed, but he didn't relax his vigilance and still focused on dealing with it.</p><p>Limited to three moves.</p><p>Tong Lingyu dared to use this Dao technique in the first move, which meant she was very confident in its power.</p><p>Based on previous experience, Qin Sang silently activated the demonic flame, condensing a layer of fire armor on his body. At the same time, he ordered the flame dragon to shrink, turning his whole body into a ball of fire, watching quietly.</p><p>Tong Lingyu turned a deaf ear to Qin Sang's response, and continued to cast spells, changing hand seals continuously.</p><p>At this moment, the battlefield changed drastically.</p><p>Cold wind howled, and extreme cold descended.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously looked up. At some point, a piece of dark light appeared above his head, like a dark cloud. In the dark light, strands of cold air moved, forming a strange forbidden diagram.</p><p>The forbidden diagram formed in an instant, but the Dao technique continued.</p><p>Forbidden diagrams quickly condensed one after another. The images in each forbidden diagram were different, but without exception, they were all images of ice and snow, instantly condensing nine of them.</p><p>In the distance, Liuli stared intently at the Great Elder's movements, muttering, "Ninefold Cold Underworld Ban!"</p><p>"Fall!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu let out a low shout.</p><p>The nine forbidden diagrams superimposed, and the terrifying coldness that could freeze the void, along with the forbidden diagrams, fell towards Qin Sang!</p><p>At the same time, the Nine Nether Demonic Flame had transformed into a flame dragon, roaring into the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't sit idly by and watch Tong Lingyu attack. Seeing the key to this Dao technique, he made a move without hesitation.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Because it was just an exchange, neither of them made any evasive movements. The demonic flame and the forbidden diagram collided at one place in front of the three people with no fancy.</p><p>Qin Sang unexpectedly discovered that these forbidden diagrams were broken into pieces with a touch of the demonic flame.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, he noticed something unusual and reacted very quickly. He changed his incantation abruptly, and against his usual practice, forcibly recalled the demonic flame to surround himself.</p><p>The next moment, the cold air around Qin Sang greatly increased, and he was suddenly enveloped in ice and snow.</p><p>The patterns in the forbidden diagram actually became reality around Qin Sang. The nine forbidden diagrams were superimposed, and various phenomena such as blizzards and icebergs emerged one after another. However, under Tong Lingyu's control, they only affected an area of less than ten zhang (丈, approx. 3.3 meters) in radius.</p><p>Qin Sang inside the forbidden diagram didn't react at all, as if he had lost the power to fight back.</p><p>'Freeze!'</p><p>Tong Lingyu shouted again.</p><p>The power of the forbidden diagram frantically rolled towards the inside.</p><p>At this moment, an astonishing wave suddenly erupted from there.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A black torrent of flame burst out of the forbidden diagram's image and pounced on Tong Lingyu.</p><p>The forbidden diagram was reorganized, and the aftermath was rolled up again to counterattack, but it could not restrict the demonic flame and hardly affected Qin Sang.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's face turned slightly pale, and she retreated, avoiding this blow. Looking at Qin Sang, who was controlling the demonic flame, she sighed softly, "I heard that Listening Snow Tower's Winter Rune and Elder Lan's Sun-Holding Ring were both restrained by Daoist Qin. It turns out it's because of this spiritual flame. I didn't expect this fire to be so extraordinary that even the Ninefold Cold Underworld Ban couldn't trap you."</p><p>Qin Sang then provoked, "If Daoist Tong uses similar methods again, then Qin will be the winner of this exchange."</p><p>Tong Lingyu responded with a smile, "It's just an exchange after all. What does it matter who wins or loses?"</p><p>Despite saying that, there was a bit more seriousness in Tong Lingyu's eyes. She stretched out her jade hand and gently patted the mustard seed bag at her waist, and a white light flew out quickly.</p><p>Inside the white light was a small seal.</p><p>This seal seemed to be made of white jade, with no words at the bottom, and four ancient divine beasts, Tengshe (��蛇, soaring snake/flying serpent), carved on the seal knob. The Tengshe were lifelike. The Tengshe held their tails in their mouths, forming a circle.</p><p>Seeing this seal, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly became extremely solemn.</p><p>Tong Lingyu did not hide it, and Qin Sang could naturally see that this seal could not be compared with a magic weapon!</p><p>"This is a Spiritual Treasure..."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart moved slightly, staring closely at the small seal.</p><p>The small seal rotated smoothly, suspended in the void in front of Tong Lingyu.</p><p>Tong Lingyu glanced at Qin Sang and said in a deep voice, "This is the Spiritual Treasure Four Soaring Serpent Seal. Daoist Qin, be careful!"</p><p>Before she finished speaking.</p><p>Tong Lingyu retracted her gaze, stared at the Four Soaring Serpent Seal, and silently urged the incantation.</p><p>'Hua!'</p><p>The Four Soaring Serpent Seal trembled uneasily, and invisible waves emanated, the void trembled, and cold flashes of light frequently appeared, like transparent flames as pure as profound ice.</p><p>Legend has it that the Tengshe is a fire flame divine beast. At this moment, the Tengshe on the small seal was bathed in cold flames, as if it could come alive at any time.</p><p>Unlike when facing the Ninefold Cold Underworld Ban, Qin Sang didn't have the feeling of being invaded by the cold, but a warning bell rang loudly in his heart, and he inexplicably felt a crisis, even more than before!</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang immediately activated the Fire Lotus and controlled the demonic flame to leave his body, re-condensing into a flame dragon in front of him.</p><p>At the same time, he discovered that the main body of the Four Soaring Serpent Seal had disappeared, and the cold light in the void had turned into endless cold flames, like a cold sun, suspended high in the sky.</p><p>Suddenly, a strange hissing sound resounded through the sky.</p><p>The sound seemed to ring in Qin Sang's ears, like the scream of an ancient divine beast, transmitted to the present world across a distant time.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could react, in that cold sun, the cold flames suddenly surged, and then a huge phantom flew out from it, which was actually a Tengshe!</p><p>The Tengshe was bathed in fire, and the eyes composed of flames were fierce, staring straight at Qin Sang, the cold flames turned into fire wings, and with a flick of its slender body, it headed straight for Qin Sang.</p><p>For a moment.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if he was being targeted by a true ancient fierce beast, and his mind suddenly tensed up.</p><p>The speed of the Tengshe was extremely astonishing, crossing the void and rushing towards him.</p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, Qin Sang immediately activated the Fire Lotus and controlled the demonic flame dragon to crash head-on.</p><p>The two flame-transformed fierce beasts crashed straight into each other. In an instant, the world was dim, and the bodies of the two fierce beasts almost collapsed at the same time!</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The sky was dim, and huge waves soared into the sky.</p><p>The two flame fierce beasts fought desperately, stirring up the rivers and seas, perishing together, and returning to their most fundamental power.</p><p>In the void, demonic flames and cold flames merged together, indistinguishable from each other, a chaotic scene, and the two forces continued to clash, and the aftermath lingered for a long time.</p><p>After a long time, the light of day penetrated into this area.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tong Lingyu had already flashed back, avoiding the aftermath, their breaths were a little rapid, looking at the center of the battlefield, their expressions were different.</p><p>The difference was that Qin Sang frowned slightly, while Tong Lingyu's eyes were quite surprised.</p><p>Although the Four Soaring Serpent Seal was strong, its power was not as powerful as Qin Sang had imagined. It was actually blocked like this!</p><p>Qin Sang knew that although controlling the demonic flame through the Eighteen Demonic Banners was more powerful than a top-grade magic weapon, it could not be compared with a Spiritual Treasure. A Spiritual Treasure should not have only this much power.</p><p>The aftermath gradually dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but look up at Tong Lingyu.</p><p>He saw that Tong Lingyu had recalled the Four Soaring Serpent Seal at some point, holding it with her fingertips, and said with a look of admiration, "Daoist Qin's demonic banner is so powerful that it easily blocked one-tenth of the power of the Four Soaring Serpent Seal!"</p><p>"One-tenth?"</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>Tong Lingyu nodded, sighing softly, "Don't think one-tenth is too little, Daoist. Ordinary top-grade magic weapons have a very hard time facing one-tenth of the power of the Four Soaring Serpent Seal."</p><p>Qin Sang heard this and felt a little unbelievable, staring intently at the Spiritual Treasure on her fingertips. One-tenth of the power of the Spiritual Treasure had already reached this level. If Tong Lingyu had made a full effort just now...</p><p>Tong Lingyu seemed to see what Qin Sang was thinking and shook her head, "Daoist Qin may have misunderstood. How can a Nascent Soul cultivator fully control the power of a Spiritual Treasure?"</p><p>She didn't keep it to herself and took the initiative to explain, "There are two ways to control a Spiritual Treasure. One is that you and the spirituality of the Spiritual Treasure are extremely compatible, and you can gain the recognition of the Spiritual Treasure without any effort, but this situation is extremely rare. The second is to forcibly tame the Spiritual Treasure, either with extremely high cultivation, making the Spiritual Treasure submit, or by practicing the Treasure Controlling Art, thereby controlling the Spiritual Treasure. Each Spiritual Treasure's Treasure Controlling Art is unique and was created by the person who refined this treasure. If this person did not engrave the Treasure Controlling Art in the Spiritual Treasure during refining, even if outsiders obtain it, they will not be able to use it without understanding the Treasure Controlling Art. But no matter which method, it has requirements for the user's cultivation. This palace's current cultivation can only exert less than 20% of the power of the Four Soaring Serpent Seal."</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Hung up two bottles of water, came back late, recovering well, managed to get out two chapters.</p><p>```</p>
