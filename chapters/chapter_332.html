Chapter 325: The Exchange


A thousand-year-old spirit herb in exchange for three Soul-Guiding Herbs and nine Heavenly Corpse Talismans.
Was it worth it?
“A thousand-year-old Blue Dew昙…”
Qin Sang’s voice echoed, followed by a streak of blue light emanating from his fingertips.
The jade box couldn’t conceal the Blue Dew昙’s aura. A dreamy, azure light illuminated a three-meter radius around Qin Sang.
Instantly, all eyes in the hall focused on Qin Sang, or rather, on the Blue Dew昙 in his hand.
A thousand years old – a phrase that instantly captivated everyone's attention.
“The Blue Dew昙 is the main ingredient of the Dew Cleansing Pill. Fellow Daoists cultivating Wood-attribute techniques can use this pill to refine their spiritual power. It can aid in breaking through bottlenecks.”
Qin Sang noticed many didn't recognize the Blue Dew昙. Taking advantage of the silence, he quickly introduced it.
Towards the end, a thought struck him. He paused, swallowing the words on the tip of his tongue, and continued in a casual tone.
“I don't cultivate Wood-attribute techniques, so this Blue Dew昙 has been of no use to me. I happen to be interested in Soul-Guiding Herbs. Would any fellow Daoist be willing to make a trade?”
Qin Sang had already decided to exchange the Blue Dew昙 for three Soul-Guiding Herbs, regardless of profit or loss. But if he could gain a bit more, it would be a welcome bonus.
As he expected, the Blue Dew昙’s revealed medicinal properties generated as much excitement as the Soul-Guiding Herb.  Even if only one-fifth of those present cultivated Wood-attribute techniques, that was still a considerable number.
Qin Sang glanced at the few individuals he’d noticed earlier, hoping their need for the Soul-Guiding Herb wasn’t too strong.
It would be a great loss if he revealed the Blue Dew昙 and still failed to acquire the herbs.
Just then, someone unexpected spoke.
Gao Yi’s expression had shifted slightly since Qin Sang revealed the Blue Dew昙. He scrutinized it, seemingly verifying its authenticity.
The telltale, star-dust-like aura of a thousand-year-old Blue Dew昙 couldn't be faked. Confirming its genuineness, Gao Yi suddenly said, “Fellow Daoist, are you sure you want to exchange the Blue Dew昙 for those three Soul-Guiding Herbs?”
Qin Sang looked at Gao Yi in surprise, not expecting the Blue Dew昙 to attract his attention.
The Dew Cleansing Pill was only effective for Foundation Establishment cultivators and couldn't increase the success rate of Core Formation. As a fake Core Formation cultivator, Gao Yi had no need for the Blue Dew昙 himself.
Unless he was buying it for someone else.
This unexpected turn of events filled Qin Sang with delight.
Undoubtedly, Gao Yi was the wealthiest cultivator present.  His interest practically guaranteed the success of the trade.
Qin Sang immediately nodded, “If Commander Gao offers a reasonable price, I will certainly exchange it. I will not go back on my word.”
This response left room for negotiation.
Qin Sang wasn’t excessively greedy. One thousand-year-old spirit herb could be exchanged for one unused, complete talisman treasure.
There was still ample room for bargaining.
Gao Yi didn’t dwell on these details. Unafraid of Qin Sang reneging, he immediately retrieved a talisman from his storage pouch and displayed it, announcing, “I, Gao Yi, will participate in the bidding for the Soul-Guiding Herb. This Gu-Demon Ring talisman treasure is both offensive and defensive, with myriad uses. Its power remains at 70%. To ensure fairness, please bear witness, fellow Daoists.”
With a flick of his wrist, Gao Yi sent the talisman treasure circling the front row of the hall, allowing others to identify it before gently placing it on a tray.
Gao Yi's actions were forthright, setting the stage for a contest of wealth. He didn't leverage his cultivation or the power of the Yin Mountain Pass, earning him respect.
The Soul-Guiding Herb had caused quite a stir, yet this was the first instance of bidding.
“A Mountain Suppressing Stele talisman treasure. Upon activation, a massive stele manifests, heavy as a thousand jun, unstoppable. Also with 70% remaining power, it should be slightly superior to Commander Gao's Gu-Demon Ring.”
The woman in red, whom Qin Sang had noticed earlier, clearly had an interest in the Soul-Guiding Herb.  She chuckled, revealing her own talisman treasure and joining the bid.
Others watched with anticipation, waiting to see Gao Yi's response.
Gao Yi remained impassive, calmly nodding. "Fellow Daoist is correct. My Gu-Demon Ring is indeed inferior to your Mountain Suppressing Stele. I concede... Are there any other fellow Daoists who wish to bid?"
"Shadowless Whip talisman treasure…"
"Starlight Armor…"
"Third-Grade Azure Lotus…"
No one had anticipated the number of talisman treasures hidden within the small hall.  Rarely seen treasures appeared one after another, three in total.
The onlookers were enthralled, witnessing a spectacle beyond expectation.
Only a few had the means to participate.  The bidding wasn’t fierce, with most carefully considering before placing their bids. Among these treasures, the Daoist's Third-Grade Azure Lotus was of the highest quality.
Just as Qin Sang began to worry, Gao Hui finally came through.
"Celestial Spear talisman treasure, offensive type, used only once."
Gao Hui retrieved the Gu-Demon Ring and produced a new talisman treasure, chuckling self-deprecatingly. "I've brought out my most prized possessions. If any fellow Daoist can offer a talisman treasure of comparable value, I can only add spirit stones on top.  Fellow Daoists need not worry about favoritism. The final decision rests with the owner of the Soul-Guiding Herb."
This Celestial Spear talisman treasure was practically equivalent to a brand new one.
With Gao Yi presenting this treasure, the woman in red and others conceded. No one continued the bid, eliminating the need for the owner of the Soul-Guiding Herbs to make a choice.
This was the shortest bidding war since the auction began, yet its twists and turns, and the display of rare treasures, left everyone exhilarated.
Gao Hui placed the talisman treasure on the tray, then, without touching the Soul-Guiding Herb, guided the three jade boxes towards Qin Sang with his spiritual power. Qin Sang obligingly caught them and tossed the Blue Dew昙 to Gao Yi.
Gao Yi opened the jade box and inspected it, nodding in satisfaction.  He pondered, "Fellow Daoist, had the Gu-Demon Ring secured the Soul-Guiding Herbs, I would have offered an additional top-grade magical artifact. The Celestial Spear's value is not much lower than the Blue Dew昙. Therefore... I will cover your auction fees.  Also, I recall you acquired a Phoenix Fall Vine earlier. Do you still require spirit wood? I have a piece of Water-Touching Wood I can offer as compensation. What are your thoughts?"
“As Commander Gao suggests!”
Qin Sang bowed in agreement. While the Water-Touching Wood was slightly less valuable than the Earthfire Paulownia, acquiring the Soul-Guiding Herbs was his primary goal. This spirit wood was a pleasant surprise.
After Gao Yi presented the Water-Touching Wood to Qin Sang, the transaction concluded to everyone's satisfaction.
Under everyone's gaze, Qin Sang didn't linger over the Soul-Guiding Herbs. After confirming their authenticity, he stored them away and continued watching the auction.
With the Soul-Guiding Herbs gone, he figured there wouldn't be many items left.
