<h1>Chapter 850: Unexpected Encounter</h1><p>Two powerful demons met at the valley entrance.</p><p>The giant bear roared, its run shaking the earth and mountains.</p><p>The golden eagle soared, evading the bear's charge.</p><p>Its golden eyes flashed, gazing into the distance, seemingly having spotted something. Seeing the bear's relentless pursuit, it let out an angry cry.</p><p>Alerted by the eagle, the bear turned its massive head, even more furious, believing its treasure had been stolen by despicable thieves.</p><p>For a time, the eagle flew through the air, the bear raged across the ground, the earth trembled, ancient trees snapped, and the wind howled—the two demons' speeds were almost equal.</p><p>Moreover, drawn by the bear's roars, surrounding beasts began to gather, a beast tide forming.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang and the others, fleeing, noticed the demons' commotion.</p><p>"Not good, that golden eagle's powers are formidable. It probably found our trail; we've been discovered."</p><p>Kong Yun landed on an ancient tree, surveying the rear.</p><p>A golden lightning bolt streaked across the sky, tearing through the clouds, rushing towards them.</p><p>Smoke billowed on the ground; there was more than one demon.</p><p>"The deep valley was originally the territory of a bear demon.  We don't know where the golden eagle came from, but it's probably as strong as the bear, both late-stage demon core demons – very tough opponents."</p><p>Yue Xiangu had been injured by the impact of the True Demon Qi, but after taking medicine, her injuries were under control.</p><p>"Escaping to the island's edge will take several hours.  We might run into other demons along the way, likely facing several battles.  With our combined strength, as long as we don't get caught in a beast tide, we should be able to escape.  Only Su Nu's cultivation is too weak; a casual blow from a demon would kill her. We can't let her face such danger…"</p><p>Since they were exposed, there was no need to hide.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others discussed their strategy as they burst from the forest, their escape light breaking through the air, fleeing at full speed.</p><p>The island's calm was shattered.  Qin Sang and his companions were trapped in a demon's nest, with demons hot on their heels, not daring to pause. Qin Sang activated the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman, his True Essence steadily depleting.</p><p>Among the four, he had the weakest cultivation and the least True Essence.</p><p>Fortunately, it wasn't a life-or-death situation requiring full activation of the talisman; holding spirit stones, Qin Sang managed to keep pace with the others.</p><p>Mountains receded beneath their feet.  Undeterred beasts attacked, but were easily dealt with.</p><p>The biggest problem was the pursuing golden eagle and giant bear; their speed and stamina were formidable, steadily closing the distance.</p><p>The chase continued for over two hours.</p><p>The golden eagle, using some unknown power, suddenly closed the distance significantly.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others wanted to eliminate the eagle first, but it was very alert, maintaining a safe distance while harassing them with thunderbolts and golden feathers, a constant annoyance.</p><p>They saw the eagle signal, likely summoning other demons, attempting a coordinated hunt.</p><p>Therefore, though stronger than the eagle and bear, they dared not stop to fight. These two demons were cunning and tough-skinned; they couldn't be killed quickly, and doing so would waste time.</p><p>As time passed, Qin Sang and the others' True Essence was heavily depleted, and the eagle and bear's stamina was also being tested.  Neither side could maintain top speed indefinitely.</p><p>However, they were still very fast, leaving the gathering beasts far behind.</p><p>Less than an hour remained before escaping the island, when they heard a strange neighing sound, like a horse's cry.</p><p>Then, a white light charged from the side—a celestial steed.</p><p>"Another demon core demon!"</p><p>Zhu Shan Weng exclaimed.</p><p>The group halted their escape light and saw the celestial steed riding on clouds, while the eagle and bear behind them were reinvigorated.  After communicating through calls, the demons charged towards them.</p><p>Demonic energy surged at the horizon; other demons were approaching.</p><p>"We must decide.  My strength should be slightly greater than the three of you. I'll hold the rear. Zhu Shan and Kong, help me contain these three demons.  Qingfeng, your escape techniques are the best. Conserve your strength; find an opportunity and immediately take Su Nu away. We'll meet outside the island."</p><p>Yue Xiangu handed Su Nu to Qin Sang.</p><p>The treasure was still with her, so she wasn't worried about Qin Sang neglecting her protection.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Yue Xiangu to really stay behind and entrust Su Nu to him, but after a moment's thought, realized that even staying behind, her chances of dying were slim.</p><p>Their combined strength was not weak; they weren't afraid of the beasts. The only thing holding them back was the presence of Su Nu.</p><p>Su Nu was escorted to safety by Qin Sang, allowing the others to regroup and defend.</p><p>A quick strategy session ensued.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Tian Ma and other demonic beasts attacked.  The Golden Eagle and Giant Bear were top-tier demons; the Tian Ma was slightly weaker.  A fierce battle erupted immediately. Qin Sang shielded Su Nu from the shockwaves, seizing an opening. His sword and the Jiao soul shone brilliantly as he unleashed incredible speed, bursting through the encirclement and fleeing.</p><p>The three demons, far from stupid, saw Qin Sang escape and, believing the treasure was on him, abandoned their other targets.</p><p>Yue Xian Gu immediately ordered a counter-attack. Her silk-based magical weapon, fully restored, snaked towards the demons, impossibly strong. Zhu Shan Weng and Kong Yun attacked with everything they had. Yue Xian Gu's decision to stay was correct; only a cultivator at the peak of the Golden Core stage could hold back the Golden Eagle and Giant Bear.</p><p>Qin Sang, leaving the three demons behind, raced towards the island's edge without looking back.</p><p>Su Nu glanced at the battlefield behind them, then at the cloaked Qin Sang, her lips slightly pursed.</p><p>Their luck held; no more demonic beasts blocked their path.</p><p>Qin Sang reached the edge of the island, looking back.  Demonic energy filled the sky; it was utter chaos. The island's previous tranquility was shattered.  </p><p>He could still faintly see dark clouds above the island's center.</p><p>Quickly scanning his surroundings, he saw Yue Xian Gu and the others still behind.  Without pausing, he determined his direction and flew towards their rendezvous point.</p><p>Su Nu was well-behaved, remaining silent, easing Qin Sang's mind considerably.</p><p>Even outside the island, beasts were drawn to the strange phenomenon.  Waves crashed on the sea. Qin Sang carved a path with his ebony sword, finally escaping the beasts.  Thinking he was safe, he hadn't flown far when three lights appeared, hurtling towards them.</p><p>They were clearly the遁光 (dùnguāng, flight) of cultivators on flying swords—three strangers.</p><p>“There are still other cultivators alive nearby?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, his brow furrowed.</p><p>They had been spotted, and the three were approaching quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his flight, shielding Su Nu behind him. Secretly grasping the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan, he lightly tapped it, sending his ebony sword soaring.  He unleashed his sword energy without reservation, displaying his hostility and warning them.</p><p>The lights stopped before them, revealing three figures who looked at Qin Sang and Su Nu in surprise.</p>
