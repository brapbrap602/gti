<h1>Chapter 1517: Twin Fiends of the North Star </h1><p>"It's him!"</p><p>Qinsang knew who this 'old acquaintance' was: the Eldest Disciple of the Ancient Fiend.</p><p>He had inquired about it later, and this person was among those who had escaped from the stele space.</p><p>Tong Lingyu had personally sent the Ancient Fiend back into the stele space, yet his divine soul had unexpectedly appeared outside.</p><p>With Qinsang's intelligence, he could guess most of it. It must have been a drama of 'deep' master-disciple affection.</p><p>Truly worthy of being trained by the Ancient Fiend, the Eldest Disciple was one step ahead.</p><p>He did not know what the Eldest Disciple had done to the Ancient Fiend, but the Ancient Fiend's current state was quite miserable.</p><p>The Eldest Disciple's intention in sending the Ancient Fiend's divine soul was obvious.</p><p>Qinsang nodded inwardly, acknowledging the favor. If the Ancient Fiend had escaped, once Qinsang left the North Sea, the old fiend would definitely vent his anger on the Green Goat Temple and seek revenge.</p><p>He had originally planned to have a chat with the Eldest Disciple.</p><p>While at the Pure Sea Sect, Qinsang had noticed that the Ancient Fiend seemed quite familiar with the Pure Sea Sect, and might know something.</p><p>Since the Ancient Fiend's divine soul was here, there was no need to find his disciple.</p><p>Qinsang picked up the teardrop, a bone-piercing chill emanating from it.</p><p>After observing it carefully for a while, he found that the Ancient Fiend's consciousness was already on the verge of collapse. It seemed he had to start the Soul Search immediately.</p><p>Qinsang saw off his guest, sealed the cave dwelling, and made numerous arrangements to assist in the Soul Search technique.</p><p>Even with such thorough preparation, Qinsang only obtained some memory fragments. The higher the opponent's cultivation, the more difficult it was for the Soul Search technique to be effective.</p><p>The Ancient Fiend's divine soul dissipated in agony, and a generation's fiend path giant had fallen!</p><p>Qinsang lowered his head, looking at the dissipating soul mist on his fingertips, recalling the Ancient Fiend's imposing manner in the Pure Sea Sect, and comparing it to his current state, he couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>The Soul Search revealed that the Ancient Fiend's understanding of the Pure Sea Sect was all normal content.</p><p>Although the Pure Sea Sect was a secluded Buddhist sect, it was not isolated from the outside world.</p><p>The one truly related to the Pure Sea Sect was the Island Master of Nine Precepts Island, the Precept-Holding True Person!</p><p>This person had unexpectedly obtained the inheritance of the Pure Sea Sect, and was possibly the only surviving inheritor in the world.</p><p>Qinsang recalled his experience in the holy land, and it seemed that he had seen the Precept-Holding True Person in the stele space. Without a doubt, this person had already been suppressed at the bottom of the tower.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qinsang got up, walked to the other side of the cave dwelling, and triggered the restrictions.</p><p>A moment later, the cave dwelling opened silently, and Liuli stood there elegantly, dressed in plain clothes. It was just that her temperament was too cold, keeping people at a distance.</p><p>Most people would feel like they had entered the depths of winter when looked at by Liuli.</p><p>Qinsang was already accustomed to Liuli's personality, and walked in on his own, saying, "I plan to go to the Boundless Sea to find a suitable island to serve as our sect's headquarters. I'll also make a trip back to the North Star Realm. I'd like to borrow the Ten Directions Earth-Breaking Divine Shuttle again to bring some disciples over."</p><p>Without a word, Liuli extended her jade hand, and a green light flashed. The divine shuttle appeared, and Qinsang caught it in his hand.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Liuli said, "That path, the Profound Sky Palace still has records of it, but only the initial segment remains."</p><p>Qinsang acknowledged, "I have already obtained the relevant records from Palace Master Tong. I'm borrowing the fairy's divine shuttle precisely to search for it carefully."</p><p>The path to the North Star Realm began at the place where Celestial Overlord Tian Yue planted his sword.</p><p>Qinsang intended to find the path and connect the two places, but he did not intend to make it public.</p><p>Liuli nodded and said no more.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Qinsang asked again, "When does the fairy plan to attempt to break through the bottleneck?"</p><p>Liuli did not answer, but frowned at Qinsang.</p><p>Qinsang took out a jade slip and handed it to Liuli. "Fairy, take a look at the contents of this. It was left by Senior Xiaoxiangzi."</p><p>While Liuli browsed the jade slip, Qinsang continued, "With Senior Xiaoxiangzi's insight, he shouldn't be wrong. After one person comprehends the Buddhist bone relic, its power will not immediately disappear, and the second person can also obtain considerable benefits. Moreover, the Central Province is where the spiritual fortune of this world gathers. It should be able to help us unravel many mysteries, such as the world outside the Storm Belt, the origin of the Purple Palace, and... where did those who ascended go!"</p><p>Withdrawing her divine sense from the jade slip, Liuli's expression showed a rare fluctuation, her eyes filled with urgency and hope. "You intend to..."</p><p>"My return this time is to settle my karmic ties so that I can set off as soon as possible," Qinsang looked at the divine shuttle in his palm. "The journey to the Central Province is long and fraught with danger. I will have to rely on the fairy's divine shuttle. However, the fairy probably won't trade this treasure, right? I can only invite the fairy to accompany me."</p><p>He had specifically borrowed the divine shuttle before to confirm that it could provide significant assistance.</p><p>Liuli hardly hesitated, clutching the jade slip tightly. "Give me eight years!"</p><p>"Eight years?"</p><p>Qinsang calculated silently. It was the time of Liuli's first Heavenly Tribulation. It seemed that she was preparing to break through after the Heavenly Tribulation, and her tone was quite confident.</p><p>Thinking about it, if not for the evil technique imprint, Liuli would have definitely broken through successfully last time.</p><p>The Spirit-Calming Incense could stabilize the mind and suppress inner demons, and with the Eight-Winged Golden Cicada's molt, there was great hope.</p><p>Eight years were worth waiting for. The Heavenly Tribulation was no child's play. If the Heavenly Tribulation were to be triggered in the Storm Belt, Qinsang would also suffer.</p><p>Moreover, he needed time to settle his karmic ties and arrange for the Green Goat Temple.</p><p>"It's a deal!"</p><p>Qinsang smiled and was about to take his leave.</p><p>Liuli remembered something and took out two pouches, handing them to Qinsang.</p><p>The pouches were made from the skin of a special spirit beast, specifically used to store Well-Dream Pearls.</p><p>Qinsang was surprised. "Two?"</p><p>As far as he knew, the Profound Sky Palace's holy land only produced three at a time.</p><p>Qinsang had already decided to have his avatar cultivate another cultivation technique, so the Well-Dream Pearls were not as important.</p><p>Liuli said, "Senior Jiang heard that you needed Well-Dream Pearls and specially exchanged for one to give you."</p><p>Hall Master Jiang's ability to ascend to the position of Grand Elder had Qinsang's influence behind it.</p><p>"Why go to such trouble?"</p><p>Qinsang shook his head with a smile, but did not refuse. He put them into the Thousand Jun Ring and took his leave.</p><p>Leaving the Listening Snow Pavilion, Qinsang headed southwest, intending to explore the Boundless Sea carefully. However, his primary goal now was Nine Precepts Island, and on the way, he would pass by a location Qinsang had previously selected as a potential sect headquarters.</p><p>Flying non-stop, the Boundless Sea came into view.</p><p>Before leaving the Hidden Sun Realm, Qinsang instinctively looked back in the direction of Skyscraping Peak.</p><p>Not long ago, he and Tong Lingyu had broken into Yin Changsheng's cave dwelling.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's divine abilities were unmatched, and his legacy must be of great value. However, what Qinsang and the others valued most were Yin Changsheng's tribulation-avoidance and breakthrough secret techniques.</p><p>Related to the Nascent Soul stage and the Heavenly Tribulation, even if they were evil techniques, they were still worth studying.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither of these secret techniques were found.</p><p>Based on the limited information, after exchanging information with Tong Lingyu, Qinsang felt even more strongly that the ice coffin was important. It should be the key to Yin Changsheng's ability to delay the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>It was just that this item was severely damaged, and its power was gone. Qinsang did not have time to focus on comprehending and restoring this treasure.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A green light flew out of the Hidden Sun Realm. It was Qinsang piloting the Ten Directions Earth-Breaking Divine Shuttle.</p><p>The divine shuttle was protected by a wind shield, making the interior exceptionally stable, and the consumption of true essence was much lower than that of similar treasures.</p><p>Qinsang flew leisurely over the sea, stopping only when he reached his first target.</p><p>Looking down from above, he surveyed the island below, which was shaped like a turtle.</p><p>The island was rich in spiritual energy, and the island master had died in the holy land, so it could be taken without any effort.</p><p>The problem was that although there were many islands nearby, the spiritual energy was pitifully thin, and it was not far from the Profound Sky Palace.</p><p>If the Green Goat Temple were to truly prosper one day, being too close to the Profound Sky Palace might not be a good thing.</p><p>Quickly ruling out this place, Qinsang continued on his journey without stopping.</p><p>As he traveled, Qinsang found that the Boundless Sea was even more chaotic than before, with killings everywhere.</p><p>The status of Core Formation stage cultivators was far greater than before, becoming the main force in the conflicts. Even those in the late Core Formation stage dared to call themselves Ancestors.</p><p>Qinsang's activation of the Exquisite Pagoda had completely changed the landscape of the Boundless Sea, ushering in a thorough reshuffling.</p><p>It was not just internal strife among the Boundless Sea forces.</p><p>The reorganized Profound Sky Palace, the demon race of the north, and the forces of the Crescent Moon Realm had all extended their reach into the area.</p><p>The covert clashes were even more dangerous.</p><p>Perhaps the chaotic scene of fiends running rampant in the Boundless Sea would become history.</p><p>The Grand Assembly of Ten Thousand Fiends would also become a misnomer.</p><p>Qinsang was happy to see this change. He did not want the Green Goat Temple to be surrounded by fiends.</p><p>...</p><p>Nine Precepts Island.</p><p>After years of management by the Precept-Holding True Person and his disciples, Nine Precepts Island had gathered many cultivators and was very prosperous.</p><p>At this time, however, Nine Precepts Island was in chaos.</p><p>Especially the core restricted area of Nine Precepts Island, where the Precept-Holding True Person's cave dwelling was located, was shrouded in clouds and mist, with the grand array activated.</p><p>Countless fiends had fallen in the holy land.</p><p>However, it was difficult for outsiders to know the exact list, and they did not dare to directly attack the territories of the fiends.</p><p>They could only try their best to gather information and make judgments based on various signs.</p><p>The Precept-Holding True Person had not shown his face for a long time, and the surrounding forces were restless. At first, they were just probing, but eventually, they received accurate information and decided to unite and attack Nine Precepts Island, this blessed land!</p><p>The Precept-Holding True Person's disciples activated the grand array and remained steadfastly inside, further fueling their suspicions.</p><p>Outside the restricted area, a large force was pressing in.</p><p>Someone called out to battle.</p><p>But inside the restricted area, there was complete silence, no response whatsoever.</p><p>The curses from the allied forces became increasingly vicious, and finally, they could not bear it any longer.</p><p>Little did they know, inside the restricted area, a scrawny old man sat on a grand chair, sipping spirit tea, leisurely watching the outside.</p><p>Behind the old man stood a man in brocade clothes, with a dignified air, but behind the scrawny old man, he only dared to bow and wait quietly, ready to obey orders at any time.</p><p>This person was originally a nominal disciple of the Precept-Holding True Person. The Precept-Holding True Person, seeing that he had some talent, had him handle the trivial matters in the city.</p><p>Now, only this nominal disciple was in the restricted area, and the Precept-Holding True Person's direct disciples were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>"You don't need to pay attention to the invitations from other forces. I have my own way to protect you. After I subdue these rabble, the Chamber of Commerce will send experts to guard Nine Precepts Island. You have managed Nine Precepts Island well, and I have developed a fondness for your talent. You will have a use in the future..."</p><p>The scrawny old man gave instructions unhurriedly. Occupying Nine Precepts Island and using the Precept-Holding True Person's people, he was not at all worried that he would rebel.</p><p>The man in brocade clothes smiled bitterly in his heart. He did not expect that being deemed by the Precept-Holding True Person as having little potential for cultivation and being thrown to handle mundane affairs would unexpectedly turn out to be a blessing in disguise, saving his life.</p><p>"This junior will follow senior's instructions!"</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the man in brocade clothes suddenly saw the old man, who had always been calm, suddenly stand up, his face changing drastically. He did not know what had happened.</p><p>The scrawny old man rushed out of the main hall, looked up at the sky, and after a moment, muttered, "Thunder Escape? Could it be that even the Thunder Mansion can't hold back anymore? Wait, there's more, this can't be..."</p><p>The next moment, a bolt of lightning pierced through the sky, arriving in an instant.</p><p>The allied forces that were attacking the restricted area stopped one after another, staring in horror at the figure suspended in mid-air.</p><p>The lightning was dazzling, making it difficult to see his appearance clearly, but this person did not hide his aura. He was clearly a mid-Nascent Soul stage monster!</p><p>Behind him, a pair of phoenix wings were beautiful.</p><p>Nowadays, there were two people in the North Sea who were in the limelight, known to almost everyone.</p><p>Combining various rumors, as well as the iconic Thunder Escape and phoenix wings, the clever ones quickly associated them with one of those people.</p><p>"Profound Sky Twin Fiends!"</p><p>"No, North Star Twin Fiends!"</p><p>...</p><p>Exclamations rose and fell, causing a great uproar.</p><p>For a time, some called them the Profound Sky Twin Fiends, and some called them the North Star Twin Fiends.</p><p>The person who had arrived was Qinsang, who had found the Ten Directions Earth-Breaking Divine Shuttle too slow and had urged on his phoenix wings to travel.</p><p>Hearing the shouts below, Qinsang didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p>Since the news spread, he and Liuli had gained the title of Profound Sky Twin Fiends, which was widely recognized by the cultivators of the North Sea and spread rapidly.</p><p>Later, Qinsang simply had someone spread the word that he and Liuli were from the legendary fourth realm of the North Sea, the North Star Realm, and they became the North Star Twin Fiends.</p><p>Poor Liuli was also described as a fiend with a heart as venomous as a snake's.</p><p>It was no exaggeration to say that the names of Qinsang and Liuli had the power to stop children from crying in the North Sea.</p><p>The Ancient Fiend and the Great Sage Sky Peng had both fallen at their hands. Weren't they even more earth-shattering, peerless fiends?</p><p>The North Star Realm was also implicated by Qinsang, becoming recognized as the source of fiends, the most terrifying fiend cave in the world.</p><p>Being feared was not a bad thing.</p><p>Qinsang glanced at the allied forces, and his gaze fell on the restricted area. Through the grand array, he saw the scene inside.</p><p>The scrawny old man was very clever. The moment he saw Qinsang, he did not hesitate to abandon everything and fled.</p><p>Just as he walked out of the secret passage, the scrawny old man suddenly heard a gentle voice.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please stay."</p><p>The scrawny old man froze in place, his smile more bitter than crying.</p><p>"Greetings, Fellow Daoist Qin. I am Feng Guzi, an elder of Star Mountain. True Person Yinquan is a close friend of mine. I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Qin to have taken a fancy to Nine Precepts Island. I was blind and offended Fellow Daoist Qin. I will leave immediately, please don't take offense..."</p><p>The Crescent Moon Realm had many hidden forces in the Boundless Sea. Their strength was inferior to the local fiends, so they could only help each other.</p><p>Now, these hidden forces were playing a major role.</p><p>Qinsang looked at Feng Guzi and nodded. "The Precept-Holding True Person's inheritors are nowhere to be seen. Fellow Daoist should have gained quite a bit, right?"</p><p>Feng Guzi let out a long sigh of relief and immediately took out a mustard seed bag, pouring out all his gains on the island, including the cultivation techniques and secret arts obtained by searching the souls of the Precept-Holding True Person's disciples.</p><p>Qinsang's gaze swept across the various jade slips, and with a wave of his sleeve, he gathered them up and said thank you.</p><p>The old man repeatedly said he didn't dare, and hurriedly left.</p><p>Flashing into the restricted area, Qinsang checked them one by one, and found that not only were there Buddhist inheritances, but also many secrets. They might be helpful when he went to the Central Province.</p><p>Putting away the useful jade slips one by one, Qinsang turned to look at the numb-looking man in brocade clothes.</p><p>Feng Guzi had deliberately left this person behind. It seemed that this person was not deeply involved with the Precept-Holding True Person and could be of use.</p><p>Qinsang threw him a token with the character 'Qin' written on it, and his unique mark.</p><p>"If anyone else comes, show them this token... someone will contact you later."</p><p>"This junior will obey."</p><p>The man in brocade clothes took the token with both hands, feeling relieved.</p><p>Since it was him, he should be able to... settle down, right.</p>
