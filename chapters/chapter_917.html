<h1>Chapter 909: Rotwing Hawks</h1><p>Passing by Qu Heng Island, Qin Sang didn't enter, but flew directly to the south of the Broken Wind Islands, towards a more chaotic area.</p><p>A few years ago, the impact of Old Devil Yin's Nascent Soul capture seemed to have passed. Qin Sang arrived smoothly at the former abode of Senior Qingzhu, near Spirit Turtle Island.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that Old Devil Yin's incident might be related to Senior Qingzhu. If the Demon Lord wanted to investigate this matter, he would definitely send people to watch the cultivators on the surrounding islands.</p><p>Just in case, Qin Sang bypassed Ba Men Island and continued south.</p><p>Along the way, he often used aliases to inquire about the situation within the Broken Wind Islands. He found that although the Broken Wind Islands were chaotic, they had their own set of rules and various factions, including some Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>He didn't want to be involved in any more disputes.</p><p>But unless he joined one of those factions, finding a safe cave to cultivate in peace wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>In a rather desolate area of the Broken Wind Islands, a figure traversed several barren islands, flying for several hours before stopping in front of a small island.</p><p>This island was only a dozen miles in diameter, with a few low hills.</p><p>Multicolored smoke billowed from the center of the island, swirling around the vegetation on the hills.</p><p>Any cultivator arriving here would immediately recognize the smoke as some kind of poisonous miasma.</p><p>However, the most dangerous thing wasn't the poisonous miasma, but the nests on the hills.</p><p>"Is this the Poison Island those people were talking about?"</p><p>The person who came here was Qin Sang.</p><p>He had arrived at the edge of the chaotic zone of the Broken Wind Islands, concealing his identity, gathering information, and searching for a cave. He had found a few places before, but none were quite satisfactory.</p><p>A few days ago, he had arrived in the nearby waters and heard from other cultivators about a Poison Island occupied by a flock of Rotwing Hawks.  Immediately intrigued, he rushed over to investigate.</p><p>Rotwing Hawks were a notorious venomous beast. Not only could they spew poisonous clouds, but their feathers and talons were also poisonous. If wounded by a Rotwing Hawk, the toxin would invade the internal organs within a few breaths.</p><p>Perhaps due to their constant exposure to intense poison, the Rotwing Hawks themselves were corroded, and their appearance was horrific.</p><p>Their entire bodies were black, their feathers scorched, emitting a foul odor. Their skin and feathers were tattered, with bones exposed in some places, like decaying corpses. Their wings were especially gruesome, hence the name Rotwing Hawks.</p><p>Mortals greatly feared these venomous beasts, believing them to be incarnations of the Grim Reaper.</p><p>Rotwing Hawks were a headache for cultivators too, often appearing in large flocks. No one dared provoke them lightly. Therefore, this Poison Island was devoid of cultivators, the Rotwing Hawks its sole masters.</p><p>As the Rotwing Hawks multiplied, fewer and fewer cultivators dared to approach.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed himself, observing the Poison Island from a distance.</p><p>Poisonous miasma filled the mountains, occasionally fluctuating with strange hawk cries.</p><p>Dark shadows frequently emerged from the hilltops, entering the miasma to inhale the poisonous gas.</p><p>Even from here, Qin Sang could sense the rich spiritual energy of the island, indicating the presence of a spirit vein.</p><p>The poisonous miasma wasn't a major problem. With some restrictions and spirit arrays, it could be completely isolated, allowing for a cave to be carved out.  Moreover, the pervasive miasma could serve as a camouflage and barrier, deterring unwanted visitors.</p><p>Qin Sang sought stability, and the more he looked at this island, the more satisfied he became.</p><p>"As long as the spirit vein on the island is sufficient to support my cultivation, I'll stay here," Qin Sang thought.</p><p>The surrounding environment was also suitable. Due to the scarcity of resources, high-level cultivators rarely came here, which suited him perfectly. The only problem was the island's original owners, the Rotwing Hawks. Having occupied the island for many years, they likely had a Core Formation Hawk King.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering, a rustling sound came from the insect basket at his waist.</p><p>Fatty was hungry again.</p><p>Two days ago, Fatty had awakened, demanding Purple Crystals, which Qin Sang had refused.  He needed Fatty's help to apply a poison-resistant shell to his body to deal with the Rotwing Hawks.</p><p>Otherwise, even he would be wary of the Core Formation Hawk King's intense poison.</p><p>This fellow, once asleep, was impossible to wake. Qin Sang had withheld its food for two days, and Fatty was greatly displeased, making a ruckus in the basket every now and then, scratching and rolling around.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected it was cursing him. If it wasn't so weak, it would probably try to rob him.</p><p>"Help me deal with these Rotwing Hawks, and I'll give you Purple Crystals."</p><p>Qin Sang pinched Fatty, lifting it out of the basket.</p><p>Fatty wriggled and hissed, venting its dissatisfaction. Then it opened its mouth and spat out a seven-colored halo, which landed on Qin Sang and the Two-Headed Azure Flood Dragon. The Flood Dragon obediently crawled onto Qin Sang's shoulders, one head on each side, ready to watch the show.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Two-Headed Azure Flood Dragon and flashed into the island.</p><p>As a precaution, Qin Sang first retrieved the Ten Yama Banners and then summoned the Ebony Sword.</p><p>There were indeed many Rotwing Hawks on the island.  As soon as Qin Sang entered, he encountered a flock. Seeing the intruder, they shrieked and sprayed poisonous clouds.</p><p>These Rotwing Hawks were only at the Foundation Establishment stage, but the combined power of their poisonous clouds far exceeded their individual cultivation levels.</p><p>However, with Fatty's poison-resistant shell, these poisonous clouds couldn't harm Qin Sang at all.</p><p>The other Rotwing Hawks were alerted.</p><p>The Poison Island suddenly became chaotic, filled with ear-piercing cries. The poisonous miasma around Qin Sang was instantly dispersed by countless Rotwing Hawks, a dark mass filling his vision, the stench overwhelming.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the poisonous clouds and unleashed a massacre with the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly also joined in, occasionally flapping its wings and unleashing thunderbolts, clearing out swathes of Rotwing Hawks, then flying around Fatty triumphantly.</p><p>Seeing the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's prowess, Fatty's small eyes darted around, then turned away disdainfully, its eyes filled with envy. It wanted to remove the butterfly's poison-resistant shell to see how long it would last, but feared Qin Sang's wrath. It felt very aggrieved.</p><p>Of course, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's main role was to scout for Qin Sang.</p><p>As flocks of Rotwing Hawks were slaughtered, they finally became fearful. Just then, an angry cry echoed from the center of the island, accompanied by a powerful surge of energy.</p><p>"The Hawk Kings are coming out, there are two of themâ€¦"</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly detected the Hawk Kings' movements. Qin Sang's face darkened. He abruptly swung his arm, and a streak of Nine Nether Demonic Fire shot out, easily piercing a hole through the flock of Rotwing Hawks and slamming into a huge dark shadow.</p><p>'Screech!'</p><p>With a scream, one Hawk King's wing was pierced. It stumbled and flew back, and before it could regain its footing, Qin Sang and the Two-Headed Azure Flood Dragon attacked.</p><p>The Two-Headed Azure Flood Dragon shot wind blades from its eyes, more powerful than before, working with the Nine Nether Demonic Fire to crush the Hawk King.</p><p>This Hawk King frantically sprayed multicolored poisonous clouds, but was horrified to discover that its opponent was completely unaffected by its killer move. Before it could mount a proper defense, it was slain.</p>
