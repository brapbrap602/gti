<h1>Chapter 269: The Ten Divine Trees</h1><p>Chapter 269: The Ten Divine Trees</p><p>"Brother Qin, recover your breath first. This old man can still persist for a while."</p><p>Yun Youzi urged Qin Sang to recover quickly as he steered the Lingzhu Flying Boat.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved two bottles of Qingling Pill, gave them to Yun Youzi just in case something unexpected happened, and then pressed the Ten Fang Yan Luo Banner against his palm heart. He sat down on the flying boat with his knees crossed and began to heal himself.</p><p>The Fire Spirit Beast pursued them relentlessly, but the Lingzhu Flying Boat was now much faster than when Qin Sang had seen it last. The situation was still under control for the time being.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that once the Jiao Dragon’s essence within the Nine Dragons’ Chariot Talisman was restored, he estimated that he would be able to operate the secret talisman at a speed comparable to the Lingzhu Flying Boat.</p><p>However, the Lingzhu Flying Boat did not seem to consume much spiritual power, whereas the secret talisman consumed a terrifying amount. In that sense, the Nine Dragons’ Chariot Talisman with only one Jiao Dragon’s essence was inferior to the Lingzhu Flying Boat.</p><p>It was evident that the Lingzhu Flying Boat was an extraordinary treasure. With it in his possession, even if Yun Youzi encountered a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he would be able to escape with ease even if he could not defeat them.</p><p>As Qin Sang recovered, he engaged in conversation with Yun Youzi.</p><p>"Senior’s encounter is similar to mine. I wonder what exactly happened in the ancient ruin? The underground cavern suddenly collapsed, and those Fire Spirit Beasts… who knows where they came from?"</p><p>Qin Sang used Yun Youzi’s words to describe his experience as well.</p><p>Yun Youzi sighed. "Before we entered the ancient ruin of the cultivator, several seniors had warned us. Now it seems that something unexpected must have happened up there. If we cannot find a way to escape, we can only go with the flow. No one knows where the magma river leads to. This old man fears most that he will end up trapped in an unknown and dangerous place from which he cannot escape. Fortunately, I encountered Brother Qin. At least we can look out for each other if we encounter danger."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. Yun Youzi was right. It was undoubtedly easier to travel with a companion than to go alone, and Yun Youzi’s Lingzhu Flying Boat was a significant advantage.</p><p>"Senior, have you seen any places where the power of the circular restriction has weakened? It might not have been able to withstand the impact of the tremors and may have developed cracks."</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head. "No, I have only explored two places underground once. One was an underground palace inhabited by Fire Birds whose strength was several times that of the Martial Practice Space. I did not dare to go down. The other was this place. Brother Qin, have you encountered something like this?"</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Qin Sang nodded. "To be honest with Senior, when I was in the Martial Practice Space, I happened to be assigned to the lowest row of chains. At the beginning, I did not understand the rules of the trial and went down to take a look. I found that the restriction in the Martial Practice Space was dim and even had cracks, but it was still sturdy at the time. After being impacted by the tremors, it might not be impossible to break it. However, the location of the Martial Practice Space is uncertain."</p><p>Since their top priority was to escape, Qin Sang concocted a reason to inform Yun Youzi of his discovery and discuss it with him.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Yun Youzi’s eyes lit up. After pondering for a moment, he said, "The Martial Practice Space and the ancient ruin of the cultivator appear to be two different spaces, but they are essentially one, separated by a restriction and connected through a stone tablet. It is possible that they are near the stone tablet."</p><p>Qin Sang responded with an affirmative grunt. "This junior shares the same idea."</p><p>"It’s worth a try!"</p><p>Spiritual power surged from Yun Youzi’s body, and the Lingzhu Flying Boat immediately changed direction and charged into a tributary.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the four Lingzhu on the flying boat and asked casually, "Senior, the speed of this bamboo boat is astonishing. What kind of Lingzhu was used to refine it? It’s extraordinary."</p><p>He only asked out of curiosity and did not really expect Yun Youzi to tell him everything without reservation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yun Youzi replied without hesitation, his tone slightly proud. "This bamboo boat is the result of this old man’s painstaking efforts. It is made from four Feiling Bamboo, which this old man obtained by chance. Although this bamboo is inferior to the Ten Divine Trees, it is still a rare type of Lingzhu. It is an extremely light wood. Refining it into a bamboo boat allows it to achieve such speed thanks to this characteristic. During my travels, I have faced many life-threatening situations, and it is all thanks to this bamboo boat that I have survived. Ah… I remember that Brother Qin’s Life-Bound Sword is made from pure wood. Do you need Lingmu to upgrade it?"</p><p>When he saw Qin Sang nod, Yun Youzi hesitated for a moment before saying, "If Brother Qin needs it, I can give you a section of Feiling Bamboo once we escape."</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback and repeatedly waved his hand. "How can I? This bamboo boat is of great importance to Senior. How can I damage it? This junior cannot bear such a heavy debt of gratitude!"</p><p>He had never expected Yun Youzi to be so generous. He had only mentioned it in passing, and yet the other man was willing to give him the Lingzhu.</p><p>It was against etiquette to accept undeserved kindness. Such a valuable gift was given to him for free. He could not accept it and even became a little wary.</p><p>Yun Youzi smiled and explained, "Brother Qin, don’t worry. This bamboo has already been refined into a magic weapon. As long as I don’t damage its source, this old man only needs to recuperate for a few days to replenish what is missing. It will not affect the power of the magic weapon. Of course, the Feiling Bamboo I give you will not be as good as the original and will be similar to ordinary Lingmu. However, it will still retain some of the characteristics of the Feiling Bamboo, which is quite rare."</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood, but still shook his head in refusal. “Many thanks for your kindness, senior. It’s just a pity that this junior’s Nascent Soul Sword is unique and requires the most pristine spirit wood. The spirit wood that was refined into my Dharma artifact had its spirituality altered, not only unable to advance but the spirit sword will be damaged instead.”</p><p>“So that’s how it is…”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer nodded thoughtfully and consoled him, “Younger Brother Qin, don’t be discouraged, Flying Spirit Bamboo is not the only such wonder in the world. There will always be an opportunity to find a spirit wood of the same level in the future. Younger Brother Qin might even have the chance to obtain one of the Ten Great Divine Trees,  elevating your Nascent Soul Sword into a Dharma treasure.”</p><p>“Senior, you jest. The Ten Great Divine Trees only exist in legends. They are divine objects that even Nascent Soul Sages would covet. This junior has only read about them in ancient books. I don’t even know if there are any Ten Great Divine Trees in this entire Minor Han Region.”</p><p>Qin Sang laughed wryly. Of course he wanted the Ten Great Divine Trees. Even a small section, or even a small piece, would suffice to make it such that he wouldn’t need to worry about his Ebony Sword’s quality before reaching the Core Formation stage.</p><p>But such divine objects were inaccessible and unattainable. In the current era where the cultivation world was declining, it was doubtful whether any of the Ten Great Divine Trees still existed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Cloud Wanderer smiled mysteriously when he heard this. “Younger Brother Qin, you look down too much upon the Minor Han Region and the Ancient Immortals’ Battlefield. From what this old man knows, leaving aside the distant past, the Ten Great Divine Trees have appeared at least three times in the past ten thousand years!”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang straightened up and asked in surprise, “The Ancient Immortals’ Battlefield truly contains such a thing? How does senior know this?”</p><p>“This old man also heard it from my master, Daoist Wanderer…”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer explained briefly and then told Qin Sang, “The Ancient Immortals’ Battlefield was formed from the battle between powerful beings in ancient times. In the depths of the battlefield, there are countless spatial rifts and countless dangers, to the point that even Nascent Soul cultivators don’t dare to enter carelessly. There are some immortal estates that have never been explored before. Once they appear, they will be accompanied by countless precious treasures. My master said that in the past ten thousand years, there have been three confirmed instances of the appearance of one of the Ten Great Divine Trees. It’s just that very few were qualified to participate in the struggle for it, so the news didn’t spread widely and few people know about it.</p>
