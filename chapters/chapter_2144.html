<h1>Chapter 2134: The Aftermath of a Great Victory</h1><p>Qin Sang paused, lost in thought.  The exploration of the stone tablet space, while seemingly arduous, had been surprisingly safe and smooth.  It seemed too easy to simply claim Mount Taiyu. Was there a hidden threat he’d overlooked?</p><p>He meticulously reviewed the entire process, recalling even the faintest fluctuations within the stone tablet space, but found nothing unusual.  Deciding further contemplation was fruitless, Qin Sang refocused, ‘observing’ Mount Taiyu.  His attention was immediately drawn to the fissures in the mountain.</p><p>From outside, only the brilliant green light emanating from the cracks was visible, obscuring any deeper view. A powerful, turbulent energy constantly emanated from within, blocking external perception.  Both Qin Sang and Min Zhuo had tried to directly investigate the depths of the fissures, without success.</p><p>Now, however, Qin Sang could ‘see’ inside. The green light originated from within the mountain itself. The walls of the fissure resembled jade, a vibrant, flawless green.</p><p>Deep within the fissure, he found a mass of green energy – the Green Spirit Qi.  It wasn't newly formed; it had been trapped there, only escaping in small amounts during each tremor of the mountain.  Unfortunately, the quality of the Green Spirit Qi wasn't high, leaving Qin Sang somewhat disappointed.</p><p>What was the source of this Green Spirit Qi?  Aside from the mountain itself and the ancient, mysterious restrictions, Qin Sang saw nothing else on Mount Taiyu.  The Green Spirit Qi didn't seem to originate from the restrictions, but rather from the mountain itself.</p><p>He shifted his attention to the mountain walls, but saw no new Green Spirit Qi forming.  Perhaps its creation required time, or perhaps it was formed during the ascension event, under specific conditions.  If the latter, he wondered if more could ever be created.</p><p>The situation within the fissure was unexpected.  Continuing his observation, Qin Sang made another startling discovery: Mount Taiyu was severely damaged, causing its internal energy to become chaotic and clash, contributing to the tremors.  The ancient restrictions were the only reason the mountain hadn’t shattered.  One of their functions was to protect the mountain; its majestic exterior concealed a fragile interior.</p><p>“Was this also caused by the ascension?” Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Driven by curiosity, he delved deeper, uncovering several more mysterious areas, including the mountain's core, a region of utter chaos even the stone tablet couldn't penetrate.  Unable to gain any further insight, Qin Sang finally turned his attention to the ancient restrictions.  With some tentative probing, he discovered that some of the surface restrictions weren't rejecting him; he could manipulate them.</p><p>He began to search for more restrictions he could control.  As he gained control over restriction after restriction, covering almost the entire mountain, he realized he could influence Mount Taiyu itself.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't found a way to refine Mount Taiyu, but he could try to move it using the restrictions!</p><p>With this in mind, he immediately began to experiment.</p><p>On the mountain's surface, the restrictions gradually became visible, causing strange phenomena.  White mist rose from within the mountain, shrouding it in a mystical aura, even obscuring the green light from the fissures.  Within the mist, Qin Sang and the stone tablet were barely visible.</p><p>The next moment, the void trembled slightly; the mist churned, and the mountain suddenly rose several tens of feet.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Mount Taiyu’s movement disturbed the abyss below. The ancient restrictions in the void emanated an unusual energy, threatening to erupt.</p><p>Sensing the danger, Qin Sang acted swiftly.  With a resounding boom, Mount Taiyu crashed back down, and the disturbance in the abyss subsided.</p><p>“Moving Mount Taiyu isn't going to be easy…” Qin Sang muttered, gazing out towards the dark abyss.</p><p>Mount Taiyu seemed to be connected to the abyss in some way.  Forcibly removing it would cause a cataclysmic event in the abyss, potentially leading to its collapse.</p><p>It seemed he had only one option: to try controlling more of the mountain's restrictions, ideally gaining complete control and severing this connection.</p><p>However, time was running out, and Qin Sang wasn't sure he could do it.</p><p>He did, however, have another option. He had his Dharma Image bring the Qianjun Ring!  This wasn't something he had foreseen.  The ring contained a small pocket dimension, and over the years it had stabilized, now encompassing a vast space of hundreds of miles in diameter.</p><p>The source of the pure spiritual energy, whether Mount Taiyu or elsewhere, could be readily extracted as long as it didn't exceed the capacity of the pocket dimension.</p><p>The prerequisite was that the object was stable enough to avoid causing tremors or collapse within the pocket dimension.</p><p>Mount Taiyu was unstable, but Qin Sang could utilize the ancient prohibitions on the mountain's surface to mask the vibrational waves.  As long as he could hold out until escaping the abyss, the problem would be easily resolved.</p><p>Leaving Mount Taiyu within the pocket dimension would be even better; a mountain is too conspicuous anywhere.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang continued his efforts, searching for more controllable ancient prohibitions.  The white mist on the mountain's surface grew thicker, a dense, ethereal fog enveloping the entire mountain until its form was completely obscured.</p><p>The ethereal fog flowed unevenly, often disturbed, but the disturbances were far weaker than the previous tremors.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang relaxed, letting out a breath, and realized he too was surrounded by the fog.</p><p>Flying out from the mountain, he summoned the Qianjun Ring.  A flash of light, and the fog and the mountain vanished.</p><p>He focused his mind on the pocket dimension and saw the mountain descending towards a specially prepared area.  The moment it landed, the earth trembled. The waves emanating from the ethereal fog did affect the pocket dimension, but less than anticipated.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>An external disturbance startled Qin Sang, pulling his attention away.  He discovered the sound originated from the abyss's depths.</p><p>From the darkness below, a terrifying power seemed to be brewing, poised to erupt.  The surrounding ancient prohibitions flickered, an unsettling atmosphere pervading the area.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang grabbed Min Zhuo, transformed into a bolt of green lightning, and charged towards the abyss's exit.</p><p>Weaving through the ancient prohibitions, Qin Sang retraced his steps, narrowly escaping danger.  Just as he was about to break free from the abyss, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>A white lightning bolt shot from an ancient prohibition, striking the green lightning.  The two electric beams crossed.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  Thankfully, his lightning escape was fast enough to avoid a direct hit, the consequences of which were unimaginable.</p><p>Outside the abyss, the ten elders and others were busily collecting the pure spiritual energy. The Storm Realm had only sent these few, who merely scavenged on the sidelines, posing no real threat.  Some Longyou clan experts, however, were eyeing the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators, planning to kill them all afterward.</p><p>"Hey, why isn't any more pure spiritual energy coming out?"</p><p>Someone used their spiritual sight to gaze into the abyss, questioning this.</p><p>The tenth elder looked towards the sky, mentally calculating, "The impure energy has reached its lowest point and is rising. Perhaps…"</p><p>Before he finished, he was interrupted by a shout, "What's that?"</p><p>Everyone looked in the direction indicated, seeing a brilliant blue light erupt from the darkness, far brighter than the pure spiritual energy.</p><p>The light's speed was astonishing.  They feared that dark area, yet the light passed through unimpeded, accompanied by a tremendously powerful, terrifying pressure.</p><p>"That pressure…"</p><p>Some present had been on battlefields and witnessed the Qingluan True Lightning Escape.</p><p>Considering this possibility, their faces changed drastically. When they finally saw what the light contained, they were horrified.</p><p>Their clan leader was held captive, completely helpless!</p><p>Fear gripped everyone.  Before they could flee, the light was upon them.</p><p>The Qingluan's Dharma image swept its wings, sending the ten elders sprawling.  Before they could react, blinding lightning descended from the sky, thick ropes of lightning tearing through their protective spells.  A numbing paralysis washed over them, rendering them unconscious.</p><p>The lightning ropes swung, tossing them before the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators. Qin Sang shouted, "Take them away!"</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace cultivators stared blankly, still reeling from the sudden turn of events – their enemies captured and at their mercy.</p><p>A Xuan Tian Palace elder tried to speak, but saw greyish-white mist rising from the depths of the impure land.  Simultaneously, the abyss stirred, a strong sense of danger overwhelming them.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>After the others left, Qin Sang retreated slowly, watching the impure energy overflow from the abyss. The ensuing phenomenon erupted.</p><p>Strange lights appeared, forming terrifying waves that clashed with the impure energy, causing chaos.  It was uncertain whether the abyss would survive this cataclysm.</p><p>Qin Sang watched for a while before departing.</p><p>…</p><p>Storm Realm.</p><p>Western Lands.</p><p>After the battle, the battlefield lay in ruins.</p><p>Su Nu, Si Lu, and Zhu Que had arrived and were overseeing the cleanup of the battlefield.</p><p>This great battle wasn't without its rewards. Although the Wu Ding Eight Extremes Chart was taken, over a year of cultivation had permanently altered the landscape of the Western Lands.  The desert had almost vanished; though still desolate, once the Storm Realm stabilized, this place would surely flourish again.</p><p>Qin Sang stood suspended in mid-air, motionless for a long time, contemplating his gains. No one dared to disturb him.</p><p>He slowly awoke, gazing at the battlefield. He saw Si Lu gathering the remnants of Lu Wang's army.</p><p>The activation of the sacrificial lightning oath’s aftershocks easily annihilated Nascent Soul stage cultivators; countless soldiers of Lu Wang's army perished instantly. Fortunately, Qin Sang had shown restraint, leaving some prisoners.</p><p>These were all Lu family elites, who could serve as Si Lu's core troops, or guard his dojo.</p><p>As for the surviving Shi Mu and others, they had sworn oaths of allegiance to Si Lu, becoming retainers of the Yan Shan Si family. They showed no impatience in carrying out their assigned tasks.</p><p>"A resounding victory!"</p><p>Qin Sang, now aware of the Qingluan Dharma Image's experience, felt a sense of profound satisfaction.</p><p>Both battlefields had resulted in complete victories, with abundant spoils.</p><p>"Hey! You're grinning like a fox! Just how many treasures did you snag this time?"</p><p>Zhu Que, who had been protecting Qin Sang, flew over upon seeing him awaken, clamoring for a share of the loot.</p><p>Qin Sang began to assess the spoils of war.</p><p>Aside from the Storm Realm achieving true peace, and his own enlightenment gained from the battle, and Si Lu's return to the Si You clan—setting aside these intangible benefits—</p><p>the most precious treasure was undoubtedly the Kun Tian Golden Lock, capable of creating a void realm.</p><p>With the Grand Protector's death, the treasure lost its owner, falling to the ground where Qin Sang claimed it.</p><p>Sadly, the Grand Protector's spatial artifact was destroyed by the sacrificial lightning oath.</p><p>The Kun Tian Golden Lock is a spiritual treasure.  Had the Grand Protector possessed the *Tong Bao Jue*, it, along with all his possessions, would have been annihilated.</p><p>Qin Sang isn't the fated master of the Kun Tian Golden Lock. To make it his, he must use a secret technique obtained from the Five Elements Alliance to gradually suppress and confuse its spirit, thus refining it. This technique is extremely tedious and cumbersome; for ordinary spiritual treasures, it's not worth the effort. But the Kun Tian Golden Lock is clearly worth the attempt.</p><p>By studying the sword light left by Tian Yue Shang Ren, his comprehension of void realms surpasses those of his level.  With the Kun Tian Golden Lock, he might be able to deploy a void realm at the mid-Void Refinement stage.</p><p>The Grand Protector's precious vase was also quite powerful, but deeply connected to its former owner—akin to a life-bound connection—making it difficult for outsiders to refine, significantly diminishing its value.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang obtained the spatial artifacts of Lu Wang and Lu Gan.</p><p>Lu Wang was one of the Four Kings of the Si You clan, and Lu Gan was his confidante.  Both possessed extremely valuable belongings.</p><p>Lu Wang in particular, bearing the legacy of the Han Jiang Lu family, had countless treasures.</p><p>The spiritual treasures and artifacts were secondary, as most of the Si You clan's unique physiques and abilities aren't compatible with outsiders.</p><p>Qin Sang was primarily interested in the spiritual materials and elixirs.  The accumulation of one of the Four Great Clans over countless years, plus the resources plundered from the Yan Shan Si family, was astonishing.</p><p>Qin Sang's resources were nearly depleted building the Thunder Altar, and these spoils significantly replenished his stores.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that Lu Wang carried the Han Jiang Lu family's mirage tower, which also fell into Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>And that’s not all.</p><p>Si Lu, noticing Qin Sang’s actions, flew into the air, bowed deeply, and said sincerely, "Thank you, Brother Qin, for avenging my clan's destruction! I can never repay this debt; Si Lu will always remember your kindness!"</p><p>Si Lu’s words were heartfelt.</p><p>Years ago, when he chose to follow Su Nu, he had endured humiliation and carried a heavy burden.  Unexpectedly, following Qin Sang, he had quickly avenged his clan's annihilation.</p><p>The main culprits behind his clan’s destruction were all eliminated without a single survivor!</p><p>Reflecting on the past, Si Lu felt a surge of emotion, filled with gratitude and respect for Qin Sang.</p><p>"My actions weren't solely for your revenge, but also served my own purposes," Qin Sang said calmly.  "With this, you can return to the Si You clan, and the Yan Shan Si family can act as a conduit for me in the future."</p><p>"Brother Qin, should you have any commands, Si Lu will not hesitate!"</p><p>Si Lu solemnly made his promise, then changed the subject. "Now that Lu Wang and the Grand Protector are dead, and the Lu family's elite forces have been wiped out, the Han Jiang Lu Manor is at its most vulnerable. Other forces won't dare act rashly for now, but once the Tutor returns and the news spreads, they will inevitably try to seize Lu family assets.  We should strike back at Han Jiang quickly, before someone else takes the spoils."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Have Su Nu and Zhu Que accompany you. I have matters to attend to, and will follow shortly."</p>
