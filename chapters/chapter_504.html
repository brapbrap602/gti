<h1>Chapter 497: The Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit</h1><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously, “What good news?”</p><p>Yun Youzi kept him in suspense. “My friend, let me ask you first, have you recovered your foundation?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and said solemnly, “The Heyun Pills Senior sent with Yu Fu have significantly weakened in efficacy. My foundation is still a little short of complete recovery. I can feel that spiritual medicines like Heyun Pills are no longer effective for me. This is my biggest concern, I’m afraid the damage to my foundation will affect my Golden Core formation.”</p><p>For a while, Qin Sang had been hesitating whether or not to refine the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower.</p><p>Having smoothly cultivated to the False Core stage, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel fortunate, perhaps the damage to his foundation wouldn't affect his breakthrough.</p><p>But he wasn't sure.</p><p>If his foundation wasn't healed and he couldn't form his Golden Core, refining these two spiritual herbs now would be a waste.</p><p>Yun Youzi said, “During my time in seclusion at the sect, I took the opportunity to consult one of my senior brothers about your problem.</p><p>This senior brother is particularly skilled in alchemy, his alchemic achievements are unparalleled in the Taiyi Danzong, surpassing even the Sect Master. If anyone can solve your doubts, it’s him.</p><p>The senior brother said that in situations like yours, where your foundation is damaged but you can still cultivate to the False Core stage with great perseverance, is very rare, but not unheard of.</p><p>According to him, this damage won't decisively affect Golden Core formation. There are successful precedents in the cultivation world, Qin Sang, you can go ahead boldly.”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up.</p><p>Taiyi Danzong was the leader in alchemy in the Xiaohan region.</p><p>Someone who could be called unparalleled in Taiyi Danzong must be extraordinary. If he couldn't believe this person, Qin Sang didn't know who else he could trust.</p><p>“However…”</p><p>Yun Youzi’s tone changed abruptly, causing Qin Sang's heart to sink.</p><p>“Qin Sang, you can’t ignore this either, especially after breaking through to the Golden Core stage. This hidden danger will have a more obvious impact on your strength. As your strength increases, the gap between you and cultivators of the same level will be magnified infinitely. In battles between high-level cultivators, even a slight difference can determine life or death…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, “Mm,” acknowledging that Yun Youzi's warning was not empty words.</p><p>The reason he could surpass his peers in the Foundation Establishment stage, without feeling the effects of his damaged foundation, and repeatedly kill enemies beyond his level, was mainly due to external forces.</p><p>Early on, there was the Ten Directions Yama Formation, more powerful than talismans, and the ghostly Blackwood Sword. Later, he possessed two magic treasures, the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, and other divine objects.</p><p>There was also the ‘Yuan Shen Sword Cultivation Chapter’ throughout his Foundation Establishment stage, as well as corpse refinement.</p><p>After breaking through to the Golden Core stage, these advantages would be erased.</p><p>Other Golden Core cultivators also have magic treasures.</p><p>Without the latter part of the ‘Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture,’ he couldn't refine corpses beyond the Flying Night Rakshasa.  This Flying Night Rakshasa is still somewhat lacking when facing true Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Only the abilities bestowed by the ‘Yuan Shen Sword Cultivation Chapter,’ the current Sword Qi Thunder Sound, and the sword light differentiation after Golden Core formation, are Qin Sang's greatest future reliance.</p><p>But this cultivation method is incomplete. Whether he can obtain the self-created cultivation method from Senior Qingzhu is still unknown.</p><p>Then, what will he use to close the gap?</p><p>As Yun Youzi said, the gap will be even greater in the future, and he will fall further and further behind.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang frowning and silent, Yun Youzi asked, “Qin Sang, do you remember the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit?”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly raised his head.</p><p>Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit!</p><p>How could he forget?</p><p>When his foundation was first damaged, he searched through the ancient books of Shao Hua Mountain, finding two heavenly treasures that could restore his foundation: one called Dao Scripture Grass, and the other, the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit!</p><p>“Do you remember what I said at Yin Mountain Pass? The place where heavenly treasures are most likely to exist is the Ziwei Palace. The heavenly treasure I found some time ago was news of the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit. It's now confirmed that a Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit does exist in Ziwei Palace!”</p><p>Yun Youzi looked at Qin Sang and said solemnly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. “Senior disappeared for so many years, were you searching for information about the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit for me? Then your hidden injuries…”</p><p>Yun Youzi “Mm’d.”</p><p>“This kind of heavenly treasure is rare. I wasn't sure at first, and time was pressing, so I went alone. Fortunately, I didn’t fail, and I found concrete information.</p><p>As for my hidden injuries, ordinary spiritual medicines are ineffective.</p><p>I only know of one method now: there's a strange realm in the Ziwei Palace that might help me. However, it’s not easy to enter, and I need your help.</p><p>After I returned, I've been searching for the Ziwei Secret Map, and I’ve almost found one.</p><p>I didn't expect you to bring out two at once, saving me a lot of effort. I'll use this time to thoroughly instruct Yu Fu.  This trip of mine…I don't know if I'll be able to return.”</p><p>Saying this, Yunyouzi glanced at Li Yu-fu, who was on guard outside the island.</p><p>Qin Sang, hearing this, worriedly said, "Senior, are you not very confident?"</p><p>Yunyouzi 'hmm'-ed, his tone calm as he said,  "This method is akin to breaking down to rebuild.  As the saying goes,  'Without breaking, there is no rebuilding,' but who can be certain of ultimately achieving the 'rebuilding'? I have at most a 10% chance of success. However, I don't want to remain stuck at the False Core stage for my whole life. I must go."</p><p>Yunyouzi's voice was firm.</p><p>Only a 10% chance!</p><p>Yunyouzi must have already made up his mind to sacrifice himself.</p><p>Yunyouzi's expression was calm. Qin Sang knew Yunyouzi's determination to pursue the Dao was unwavering; it was impossible to dissuade him. As a friend, all he could do was give his full support.</p><p>"Senior, is that wondrous place in the inner or outer hall?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Qin, you know the Purple Micro Palace quite well!"</p><p>Yunyouzi said, "It's in the inner hall, including the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.  Both our cultivations wouldn't allow us to progress an inch in the outer hall; I wouldn't dare try it. Time is short. I need to prepare some aids to help us reach the inner hall entrance."</p><p>The inner hall is fine.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. If it were the outer hall, it would conflict with his agreement with Jing Po.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang said, "Senior, just prepare yourself. I have a way to reach the inner hall entrance. We can meet there."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>Yunyouzi didn't delve into Qin Sang's secret, overjoyed, he said, "That saves me a lot of time! Qin, you are truly a lucky star.  I only hope this time will go as smoothly as before!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, eagerly saying,  "Senior, tell me more about the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit…"</p><p>Yunyouzi, remembering this, put away his smile, and said solemnly, "The Purple Micro Palace indeed has the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, but I must warn you! If your Core Formation fails, consider this trip advance scouting, don't force it.  Wait until you break through to the Core Formation stage. The next time the Purple Micro Palace opens, come and compete again. Because those competing for this fruit with you are Core Formation-stage great demons from the Sky Demon Mountain, perhaps more than one!"</p>
