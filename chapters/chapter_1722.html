<h1>Chapter 1713: Heavenly Devilish Sound</h1><p>After achieving the Transcendent God realm, Qin Sang hadn't focused on cultivation or thoroughly investigated the changes after his breakthrough. He'd been searching for the source of the devilish sound.</p><p>After staying in the North Sea for a while, Qin Sang flew to the East Sea, eventually even entering the storm zone. The devilish sound was everywhere!</p><p>He made a new discovery: in the storm zone, the sound was clearer than within the barrier protecting the cultivation world.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang dared to conclude that the devilish sound was intertwined with the world's Heavenly Dao, perhaps even caused by its anomaly—a Heavenly Devilish Sound!</p><p>Because of this, only those who cultivated to a certain level could perceive it.  The Heavenly Dao of this world had undergone a strange change!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel fortunate that it was his main body that broke through, not his Sky-Eyed Butterfly. If the butterfly had encountered the Heavenly Devilish Sound during its breakthrough, he couldn't imagine the consequences.</p><p>Edge of the storm zone.</p><p>Amidst the storm, Qin Sang gazed across the barrier at the boundless sea of the cultivation world.</p><p>Realizing it was the Heavenly Devilish Sound, Qin Sang recalled past events.</p><p>Why did the Purple Thunder Real Person, the leader of a sect and head of the Daoist schools, fall to his heart demon tribulation?</p><p>Why did the ancient demon of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect go mad?</p><p>During the Demon Subjugation War, why did the two Transcendent God cultivators leave them as assistants, unable to use their full strength?</p><p>Why did the Qinghu Saint King covet the Soul-Calming Incense, scheming to obtain its formula?</p><p>…</p><p>The question was, when did the devilish sound begin its anomaly?</p><p>Though protected by the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang wasn't affected by the madness in the devilish sound, but he could still sense its terror. For others, especially during heart demon tribulations, it would be a fatal threat!</p><p>If the devilish sound had always existed, Transcendent God cultivators in this world would not be rare, but rather a once-in-ten-thousand-years occurrence!</p><p>Eight Scenic View's legacy, with its numerous Transcendent Gods, suggests that if the Purple Thunder Real Person knew about the Heavenly Dao's anomaly, failing to prepare adequately and attempting the tribulation unprepared was tantamount to suicide, illogical.</p><p>Considering the Immortal Palace's ascension, the unknown whereabouts of Dan Yu True Monarch, and the frenzied beasts leaving their lairs to wander, Qin Sang had his answer.</p><p>It was very likely that the devilish sound suddenly appeared around the time the Ziwei Palace ascended!</p><p>“Ziwei Palace, Heavenly Devilish Sound, Abyss of Return…”</p><p>One name after another surfaced in Qin Sang's mind.  Those incredibly mysterious places, according to the Ghost Mother, shouldn't exist in a small thousand world. What earth-shattering secrets did they hold?</p><p>Ghost Mother!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly thought, the Ghost Mother's cultivation was sealed at the Nascent Soul stage, unable to break through.  Was this not an assassination by an enemy, but rather protection?</p><p>Unfortunately, the Ghost Mother had left this world, making verification impossible.</p><p>“The Qinghu Saint King, taking what she wanted, giving me the Four Saints Gathering Spirit Array and the *Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture*, was clearly malicious!  She was clearly trying to help me quickly reach Transcendent God, leading me to my death. Without the Jade Buddha, during the ritual to summon the Heavenly Demon, I would have died before reaching Transcendent God…”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes turned cold.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King's actions were erratic and ruthless, and she had long harbored murderous intent towards him. Her treachery wasn't unexpected.</p><p>Did the Hui Guang Saint act as an intermediary out of genuine kindness?</p><p>The old monk, with his sanctimonious demeanor, cooperated with the Qinghu Saint King's hard and soft tactics, aiming only to appease him and ensure obtaining the Soul-Calming Incense formula.</p><p>Qin Sang could guess Hui Guang Saint's intentions quite well.</p><p>With the Immortal Palace's ascension, Buddhism lost its opportunities within the palace, unable to guarantee the continuous emergence of Transcendent Gods and dominance over the Central Plains.  Its gradual decline was inevitable.</p><p>The path of immortality was difficult; cultivators in this world had at least a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Once cultivators learned that the devilish sound blocked their path, plunging them into despair, how many could endure the solitude?</p><p>When cultivators were controlled by the six desires and muddy currents, chaos would inevitably erupt.  When the outstanding are destroyed, without Transcendent God cultivators, how long could Buddhism maintain its dominant position?</p><p>Those powerful individuals outside Buddhism, unburdened and unchecked by Transcendent Gods, could act wantonly in this world.  In Hui Guang Saint's eyes, they were all destabilizing factors to be eliminated.</p><p>Even if Hui Guang Saint wasn't involved, he was happy to see the Qinghu Saint King's poisonous plan succeed.</p><p>However, they never imagined that a treasure like the Jade Buddha existed!</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the *Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture* and the entire ritual process.</p><p>His previous speculations needed to be overturned.</p><p>The ritual's changes were certainly related to the Heavenly Devilish Sound, but it could also be inferred that the source of the Heavenly Devilish Sound wasn't an extraterrestrial demon.</p><p>Otherwise, he would have summoned the Heavenly Devilish Sound on the spot.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the piercing shriek during the ritual; it didn't sound like the Heavenly Devilish Sound.</p><p>Was it an extra-dimensional demon invading this world, exposed to the Heavenly Demon Sound, and screaming in response?</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's expression darkened, and a more terrifying conjecture arose in his mind.</p><p>He had a feeling back then that the shriek was like the cry of something dying.</p><p>Could it be that the first extra-dimensional demon he brought here was defeated by the Heavenly Demon Sound, instantly killed?  The ensuing change alerted stronger extra-dimensional demons, causing them to 'look' towards this world, hence the second demonic intent being so swift and powerful.</p><p>Because of this, the demonic intent condensed into the Lifeless Demon Seal, possessing far greater power than expected.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's brows furrowed tightly.</p><p>If this was the truth…</p><p>The existence suspected to be an extra-dimensional demon lord had already cast its gaze here, clashed with the Heavenly Demon Sound, failed to successfully descend into this world, and Qin Sang escaped a catastrophe.  But a connection was formed between them through the ritual; the demon lord likely noticed him through the altar, perhaps even remembering his aura!</p><p>Legend says that extra-dimensional demons regard cultivators as prey.  Once targeted by one, it's a life-or-death struggle; every tribulation they face will bring a demonic attack, until they transcend.</p><p>However, only when cultivators break through to the Nascent Soul stage do their tribulations become strong enough to cause a disruption in Heaven and Earth, attracting the attention of external evils. Generally, the strength of the attracted extra-dimensional demon correlates with the intensity of the tribulation; Nascent Soul tribulations don't interest demon lords.</p><p>Other demons wouldn't dare to contest the demon lord's prey.</p><p>If he's marked by a demon lord, he'll face one during his Nascent Soul tribulation!</p><p>Can the jade Buddha suppress his inner demons and withstand a demon lord?</p><p>Thinking this much is pointless right now.  Whether he can even leave this world is unknown; he dare not restart the ritual anytime soon.  The extra-dimensional demon might not be a lord; worrying is futile, just self-scare.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled slowly!</p><p>Conversely, the Heavenly Demon Sound was able to prevent the suspected demon lord from descending without being extinguished, indicating they are of the same level.</p><p>Cultivators in this world reach at most the Divine Transformation stage; they lack the ability to deal with the Heavenly Demon Sound and can only be at its mercy.</p><p>The only solution is to escape this world!</p><p>What is the origin of this Lesser Thousand World, and why is it targeted by such a powerful being?</p><p>Qin Sang was utterly baffled.</p><p>Having figured this much out, Qin Sang needs to consider his future course.</p><p>The Demon Sound envelops the land, ferocious beasts run rampant, and the Return Void, where the Ascension Marker lies, is unstable; the source of the Demon Sound may even be deep within the Return Void.</p><p>Two Divine Transformation cultivators organized people to hunt the beasts, apparently obtaining something from them.</p><p>"Are the Hui Guang Saint and the Qing Hu Saint King still in this world?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt that they wouldn't dare to stay for too long.</p><p>The Heavenly Demon Sound constantly assaults their minds, gradually driving them to madness. The longer they stay, the deeper the demonic intent takes root; if they don't go mad, they'll still be significantly weakened and unable to challenge the Return Void.</p><p>Because of this, although Qin Sang just broke through to the Divine Transformation stage, he doesn't fear the two veteran Divine Transformation cultivators much.</p><p>Firstly, his magical powers and treasures are sharp enough; secondly, the others must constantly resist the Demon Sound and suppress their demonic thoughts, unable to attack with full force unless they want to end up like the ancient demon of Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>Of course, he can't be overconfident; they have dominated this world for years, plundered numerous ancient realms, and possess countless treasures.</p><p>Putting himself in their shoes, if Qin Sang didn't have the jade Buddha, his only option would be to escape this world by any means.</p><p>Qing Hu Saint King aggressively seized the Nan Ming Li Huo and Zhen Ling Xiang formulas.</p><p>Hui Guang Saint King, together with Tian Hao Tower and Ba Jing Guan, hastily formed the Three Sects Alliance—more to maintain stability in the cultivation world than to let Gan Lu Chan Yuan dominate.</p><p>All these actions show their desperate desire to escape.</p><p>Having settled matters and made preparations, they'll probably set off eastward, seeking a way out.</p><p>Though Qin Sang is furious at being manipulated, he must also consider reality.</p><p>Can he alone pass through the altered Return Void and reach the Ascension Marker's gate?</p><p>If that path is closed, what then?</p><p>Once Hui Guang Saint and Qing Hu Saint King leave, it'll be hard for this world to produce new Divine Transformation cultivators; finding help will then be difficult for Qin Sang.</p><p>But once those two know of his Divine Transformation breakthrough, they will guess he possesses a treasure for protecting the mind. How can he ensure their sincere cooperation and prevent ill intentions?</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang has just achieved Divine Transformation and needs to cultivate to consolidate his strength.</p><p>Even the Return Void before the change wasn't something a newly-promoted Divine Transformation cultivator could easily traverse. Qin Sang can take his time; they obviously cannot wait indefinitely.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's mind flashed with the image of someone he could absolutely trust, and his face darkened.</p><p>Liuli's cultivation had the mark of a demonic technique, a flaw in her character; the Heavenly Demon's Song combined with her karmic tribulation meant certain death.  Without resolving the Heavenly Demon's Song, even if the demonic mark could be removed, hope remained slim.</p><p>Would she be stopped here?</p><p>"Tranquil Spirit Incense..." Qin Sang thought of this treasure.</p><p>The claim by the Qinghu Saint King that vast quantities of Tranquil Spirit Incense were needed was undoubtedly a lie.  Facing the Heavenly Demon's Song, simply piling up incense wouldn't suffice.</p><p>"They must be trying to improve the formula, to refine a more potent incense!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes glinted. Two Nascent Soul cultivators, gathering masters of this art, combining the strengths of two races—it was entirely possible.</p><p>After long reflection, Qin Sang set off for Luye, abandoning further wandering.</p><p>Luye rested by the North Sea.</p><p>The atmosphere in the Daoist temple was strange. The external avatar remained seated atop Luye's main peak, silent. Shen Chen and the others, unsure what had happened, gathered below, their hearts unsettled.</p><p>Shen Chen, restless, repeatedly glanced towards the summit.  Suddenly he froze; the others noticed a figure appear beside the avatar.</p><p>"Come up."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to those below.</p><p>Shen Chen and the others hurried up the mountain, kneeling and prostrating themselves before him, chanting praises.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bother concealing his cultivation.  Shen Chen and the others felt as if they were facing a world, intimidated without any overt action.</p><p>Qin Sang grunted, looking at the Mingyue Guards.</p><p>"Considering your past contributions in the treasure hunt, I will keep my promise and release the Mingyue Seal..."</p><p>Before Qin Sang finished, the Mingyue Guards prostrated themselves. "We wish to join the Qingyang Temple, wholeheartedly assisting the Temple Master, upholding its glory. We beg for your acceptance, Master."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled.</p><p>He'd planned to observe them, to keep them for a while longer, but before he could speak, they'd volunteered to stay.</p><p>"Join the Qingyang Temple?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over them.</p><p>Threatened with death, their subservience was understandable.  But their adaptability made them untrustworthy.</p><p>In the future, if Qin Sang left this realm and Shen Chen lacked the strength to control them, a weak master and strong subordinates would be a recipe for disaster.</p><p>"Since you wish to remain, you shall be guest lecturers at the Qingyang Temple. Your continued service will determine your future," Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>The Mingyue Guards were disappointed, but to have their seals removed and become guest lecturers to a Nascent Soul cultivator was an unimaginable opportunity. They kowtowed repeatedly, expressing their gratitude.</p><p>"You may leave..."</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Shen Chen a few more times, then dismissed them.</p><p>Shen Chen requested permission to send invitations to various sects, inviting them to a Nascent Soul ceremony, but Qin Sang refused, leaving him dejected.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the Tribulation Ascension Platform, gently summoning the Bingyi Divine Disk and the Huoxi Spear.</p><p>The tribulation array had indeed consumed a great deal of energy. The ice disk was no longer crystalline, its texture now like mutton fat jade, its internal cold energy greatly depleted. The Huoxi Spear was similar, both treasures considerably dimmer. They required a long period of nurturing.</p><p>The outer grooves of the Taiji Ascension Platform were empty; all forty-nine ice-fire talismans were destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the platform; there were cracks, but the inner restrictions were intact and easily repairable. It could still be used.</p><p>"Will such a rare treasure ever see use again?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. The tribulation array could only weaken the three heavenly tribulations, ineffective against the karmic tribulation and the Demon Song.</p><p>Flying down the mountain, Qin Sang visited the mountain's interior, placing the Bingyi Divine Disk and Huoxi Spear within a spirit array for nurturing.</p><p>Returning to his cave dwelling, Qin Sang sat in meditation, sending out a decree.</p><p>From deep within the bamboo forest, the Earthbound Dragon's lair echoed with rustling sounds. Several Earthbound Dragons, at the Yao Dan stage, emerged, landing before the cave dwelling and obediently lying down.</p><p>Several luminous points then drifted from the cave, entering each dragon's forehead. The dragons trembled slightly, their heads bowing lower, their eyes reflecting a peculiar light—a mixture of wonder and gratitude.</p><p>The points of light were Emperor's Flowing Liquid, capable of transforming spirits and awakening intelligence.  Qin Sang had obtained it before, but now little remained.</p><p>The avatar nodded to the main body, leaving the cave dwelling, lightly patting the spirit beast bag at his waist. The Earthbound Dragons scrambled inside, then the avatar, flashing swiftly, flew away from Luye.</p><p>He should have allowed the avatar to remain in the cave for cultivation, to recover his essence, but fate intervened.  He needed to send him out again.</p><p>Leaving Luye, the avatar headed east, toward the East Sea, reaching the vicinity of the so-called East Sea Demon Territory, where he released the Earthbound Dragons.</p><p>Then, the avatar returned to the mainland alone, passing Fujiang Mouth, and entering the Central Plains.</p><p>This split operation aimed to probe the situations of the two races, thereby inferring the plans and actions of the two Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The main body remained at the Luye Daoist temple, striving to consolidate his cultivation before making further plans.</p>
