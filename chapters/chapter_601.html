<h1>Chapter 594: Ancient Teleportation Formation (Part Three! Please Vote!)</h1><p>Countless potent sword intents, each carrying a terrifying pressure, hung suspended in the void.</p><p>Qin Sang had traversed this path without disturbing them, likely thanks to the Ebony Wood Sword and the Killing Talismans.</p><p>This ancient hall was accessible only to disciples cultivating the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture." Any other intruder would instantly be devoured by a myriad of swords.</p><p>With every step Qin Sang took, a stone sword would stir, unleashing its sword intent.</p><p>He parried with his own sword, absorbing the essence within each intent.</p><p>Sometimes, it was a solitary figure practicing swordplay, executing exquisite techniques.</p><p>Sometimes, it was a scene of carnage, a single figure standing amidst a mountain of corpses, their killing intent shaking the heavens.</p><p>Or perhaps, a mysterious sword light flashed through the void, its origin and destination unknown.</p><p>…</p><p>Each intent was unique, fleeting like a glimpse of a divine bird, with a blurred background. Only the sword intent itself was clear, and the amount one could comprehend depended entirely on their own abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang strived to memorize as much as possible.</p><p>As expected, the further he went, the more formidable the sword intents became.</p><p>If he relied solely on himself, he would have to proceed cautiously, making slow progress. Such a carefree advance would be impossible.</p><p>His Ebony Wood Sword clashed with the sword intents. Whenever he felt overwhelmed, Qin Sang would immediately withdraw his sword, allowing the intent to enter his Primordial Spirit space, where the Jade Buddha would shatter it.</p><p>Along the way, he absorbed a wealth of profound and obscure knowledge, much of which he couldn't immediately grasp, but he etched it into his memory.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh; this was the advantage of having a lineage.</p><p>Often, what hindered cultivators was a thin membrane that could be easily pierced.</p><p>Some received guidance from their sect or masters, effortlessly breaking through.</p><p>Others, however, stumbled around like headless flies, possibly never finding the entrance.</p><p>These stone swords were clearly left by different individuals, as none of the sword intents were identical. Though they all cultivated the same scripture, they had each walked their own path.</p><p>Information was scarce, fleeting like footprints in the snow. Even with Qin Sang's discerning eye, he couldn't determine the cultivation levels of these swordsmen, but their power was undoubtedly immense.</p><p>With so many experts, such a mighty sect, how did they meet their demise?</p><p>Time flowed like a river, and the world changed drastically.</p><p>Even they couldn't achieve eternity.</p><p>Of their legacy, only a fragmented scroll of the cultivation scripture remained. Countless ancient texts contained not a single record of them.</p><p>All had vanished, swallowed by the river of time, leaving only a pitiful sword intent sealed within each stone sword, their sole remaining trace.</p><p>Through these, one could glimpse the brilliance of their predecessors.</p><p>…</p><p>The sword path was long.</p><p>Qin Sang walked through the forest of swords, step by step, darkness parting before him. Yet, he still couldn't see the end of the path.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang stopped. He finally saw something different.</p><p>At the end of the sword path, there was a stone gate!</p><p>The stone gate, opened by an unknown hand, was ajar, and darkness lay within.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the scene, scrutinizing even the gaps between the stone swords, but he couldn't find anything unusual.</p><p>Senior Qing Zhu's remains were likely still ahead!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened slightly. Typically, major sects wouldn't have just one trial ground. Each location usually held only one type of trial. Could there be another trial ahead?</p><p>Grandmother Jing hadn't mentioned this variable.</p><p>This place might be a trial ground designed for Core Formation cultivators. The Jade Buddha could only protect his Primordial Spirit. While he could easily traverse this sword path, he might not be able to overcome other trials.</p><p>This thought weighed heavily on Qin Sang's mind. He quickened his pace towards the stone gate.</p><p>‘Creak…’</p><p>Qin Sang pushed the stone gate open. Seeing the scene within, his expression relaxed.</p><p>Inside was a small, square ancient hall, much smaller than the sword path outside. There were no other trials, and the hall was quiet, seemingly devoid of danger.</p><p>Relieved, Qin Sang stood at the entrance, carefully examining the hall.</p><p>Though dim, the hall was small enough to be seen at a glance.</p><p>The walls and floor were made of blue stone bricks, identical to those outside. However, there wasn't a single stone sword within, making it appear quite empty.</p><p>The only object within was a person-high altar in the center of the hall. Strange runes seemed to be carved along the altar's edge, resembling a spirit formation.</p><p>Senior Qing Zhu's remains weren't here!</p><p>Qin Sang frowned deeply. This outcome was unexpected.</p><p>Senior Qing Zhu had briefly appeared in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and then vanished without a trace. Considering the timing, it coincided with the last opening of the Purple Firmament Palace.</p><p>Grandmother Jing was certain that Senior Qing Zhu had disappeared in this ancient hall. The information she provided should be reliable; everything he encountered before entering the hall matched her description.</p><p>Where was the problem?</p><p>Unwilling to give up, Qin Sang hurriedly checked the hall's walls, hoping to find a hidden door, but there was none.</p><p>Finally, his gaze landed on the altar in the center of the hall. He tentatively took a step forward. Seeing nothing unusual, he flew directly towards the altar.</p><p>The square altar had steps leading down on each side.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended the altar in a few strides. As he saw the complete spirit formation on the altar, a sense of familiarity washed over him.</p><p>"This… could this be an ancient teleportation formation?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, astonished.</p><p>The spirit formation on the altar was in the shape of a Bagua, its eight corners pointing to the Bagua positions. It was filled with dense, mysterious runes and symbols. Currently, the eight corners were empty, but there were eight distinct grooves for inserting spirit stones.</p><p>Seeing this formation, Qin Sang immediately recalled the ancient teleportation formation in the Upper Yuan Pure Serenity Palace.</p><p>He had used it twice before, and the memory was vivid.</p><p>The two formations were identical in shape, and even the ancient restrictions and runes within were over ninety percent the same.</p><p>The difference was that this formation was much smaller than the one in the Upper Yuan Pure Serenity Palace, with its center only large enough for one or two people.</p><p>Furthermore, the ancient runes in this formation were even denser than those in the Upper Yuan Pure Serenity Palace, crammed together within the limited space.</p><p>Without needing to test it, Qin Sang was certain that this was an ancient teleportation formation!</p><p>At the end of the sword path was a teleportation formation. Could the sword forest outside be a protective measure for the formation, not a trial?</p><p>Where did this teleportation formation lead?</p><p>Could Senior Qing Zhu still be alive, having used the teleportation formation to leave the Small Cold Realm?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but let his thoughts wander. He stared at the teleportation formation, confirming that it was intact. If the corresponding formation on the other side wasn't damaged, it could be activated by inserting spirit stones into the eight corners.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Suddenly, his peripheral vision caught something. On a stone pillar at the edge of the altar, there were markings that appeared to be deliberately left behind.</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang rushed to the pillar. He saw a line of writing on the pillar.</p><p>The writing was very潦草, barely legible, clearly written in haste.</p><p>And beside the writing, two extremely complex patterns captured Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>Two Killing Talismans!</p>
