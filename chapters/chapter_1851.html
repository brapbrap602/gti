<h1>Chapter 1842: Imminent Invasion</h1><p>Recalling the Red Gold Spirit Needle and the nearby illusions, Qin Sang tried to piece together some clues, but found nothing.  He stopped wasting his energy.</p><p>After cultivating for a while, Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state. After a moment's thought, he summoned his talisman altar.</p><p>Inside the altar, the divine thunder seal, formed from the Dharma image, slowly rotated, showing signs of solidifying.</p><p>His mind raced, the talisman representing the Five Thunder Secret Technique appeared in his mind, and he separated the next shape to be refined into the altar.</p><p>However, almost all the thunder turtle demon core he used to refine the altar was depleted.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't been able to hunt any more thunder beasts.</p><p>Although Jushan City frequently held auctions and trade fairs, high-grade thunder attribute spiritual objects meeting his requirements were extremely rare. Even if they did appear, they would most likely end up in the hands of the cultivators from the Left and Right Thunder Palaces, leaving nothing for independent cultivators like him.</p><p>The talisman form, Daoist court and Left and Right Thunder Palaces' scriptures on Dharma techniques, all flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Ancient experts’ interpretations made understanding the talisman form not difficult. Qin Sang quickly grasped the meaning and silently activated his Dharma image.</p><p>The Azure Bird Dharma image and the Phoenix Wings appeared simultaneously, filling the cave with azure light.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang planned to use the Azure Bird Dharma image to draw upon the Azure Bird's inherent thunder power within the Phoenix Wings to forge the altar!</p><p>Qin Sang had this idea a long time ago. During each previous exploration of refining the altar, Qin Sang would take the opportunity to deepen his understanding of the Dharma image and Phoenix Wings, experimenting with this method.</p><p>After repeated attempts, Qin Sang now had considerable confidence in drawing out a trace of the inherent thunder power from the Phoenix Wings.</p><p>The only problem was whether the altar could withstand the Azure Bird's inherent thunder power.</p><p>The spiritual object's rank was too high, its power too strong, it might backlash and damage his spiritual apertures, causing the talisman form to dissipate and the altar forging to fail.  He had a precedent for this when he was first learning.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have an accurate understanding of the rank of the Azure Bird's inherent thunder power, but the Azure Bird's cultivation before its death certainly far surpassed his own.</p><p>Qin Sang still had to try, because as the three-stage Dharma technique's apertures merged and its form gradually became complete, the altar was far more stable than before, and should be able to withstand a stronger impact.</p><p>He was going to test the altar's limits.</p><p>If successful, he wouldn't need to seek external resources.</p><p>The Azure Bird Dharma image circled his head once, then plunged into his body.  Qin Sang's aura changed, the feathers on the Phoenix Wings trembled slightly, their luster shifting, becoming even more brilliant and crystal-clear, each feather looking like jade carving.</p><p>Qin Sang slightly narrowed his eyes, his mind connected to the Dharma image, the Dharma image's power seeped into the Phoenix Wings, sensing the existence of the inherent thunder power.</p><p>This power was very quiet within the Phoenix Wings. Once touched, its inherently violent nature became clear – far surpassing heavenly thunder – yet it didn't repel Qin Sang.</p><p>The Phoenix Wings were part of Qin Sang's body. The inherent thunder power and he had coexisted for a long time, there was already a tendency for them to merge, moreover, Qin Sang’s fusion with the Dharma image made his aura close to that of a true Azure Bird.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang used the Dharma image's power to envelop the inherent thunder power, trying to gently touch it.</p><p>There was no backlash.</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly relieved, tentatively drawing the inherent thunder power, acting with extreme caution. He failed countless times before successfully drawing out a single strand.</p><p>When the inherent thunder power left the Phoenix Wings, azure lightning instantly illuminated the entire cave, incredibly dazzling.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but squint.</p><p>His eyes couldn't see anything, only in his perception did that strand of thunder power exist, slowly moving towards him.</p><p>In the center of the lightning, there was an extremely tiny strand of thunder power. Though tiny, it still maintained its lightning shape.</p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang murmured, "From now on, I'll call you Azure Bird True Thunder…"</p><p>The Azure Bird True Thunder was like a living creature, coiling and writhing, but relatively stable.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully experienced it, then continued, using this strand of Azure Bird True Thunder to trace the talisman form he had just comprehended.</p><p>Perhaps because the Azure Bird True Thunder had a similar aura to his own, Qin Sang surprisingly found that controlling the Azure Bird True Thunder to depict the talisman form was not difficult.</p><p>In a short while, a blue talisman form appeared in mid-air.  Arcs of electricity continuously flickered within the talisman form, giving a very dangerous feeling.</p><p>The higher the rank of the spiritual object, the less needed.  Just a single strand of Azure Bird True Thunder was enough to construct a complete talisman form.</p><p>The next step, embedding the talisman form into the altar, was also crucial.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was serious, he guided the talisman form slowly towards the altar. As the lightning flickered, it merged inward.</p><p>Before the talisman form was fully embedded, the altar suddenly shook violently.  The divine thunder seal became translucent at a speed visible to the naked eye, then a rich azure light exploded within the altar, the entire altar seeming as if it might explode at any moment.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed drastically, he instantly cast several hand seals, forcibly separating the azure light from the altar.</p><p>With a sweep of his sleeve, the stone door of the cave burst open, and a green light shot out like a dragon.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>A thunderclap shook the heavens, echoing through the flower field.</p><p>At that moment, the entire space was filled with green light, a green lightning bolt seemingly splitting the sky, fleeting in an instant.</p><p>The thunder reverberated, lingering endlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang, somehow standing before the cave entrance, watched the spectacle of the Azure Vermillion Thunder’s eruption, recalling the previous scene, and couldn't help but feel a chill run down his spine.</p><p>The Azure Vermillion Thunder was clearly of too high an order, the gap was too vast, exceeding the altar's capacity.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite its high order, the number he could control was too small, so it was not yet a significant force.</p><p>“That Azure Vermillion bird… truly extraordinary…”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the process of obtaining the Azure Vermillion Thunder, unable to imagine why these powerful divine beasts had become so weak, hidden in a small thousand-world.</p><p>Turning back into the cave, he saw the frightened Fire Jade Centipede cowering in a corner, trembling.</p><p>The first attempt failed, and it seemed almost impossible to succeed.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang saw a turning point. He sat back on the meditation cushion, gazing at the altar, his expression thoughtful.</p><p>After days of deep thought, Qin Sang finally sorted out his ideas and began a second attempt.</p><p>The initial steps were the same as before, still constructing the talisman shape with the Azure Vermillion Thunder. But when embedding the talisman into the altar, the mental energy Qin Sang expended was several times greater than before. It was no longer a simple embedding, but an active guiding of the Azure Vermillion Thunder's energy, merging it into every line and every corner of the talisman.</p><p>The talisman altar was not a simple superposition, but a combination with the previous talismans into a unified whole. The primary Jade Clear Summoning Thunder Talisman, the secondary Flowing Gold Fire Bell Thunder Summoning, and the tertiary Five Thunder Secret Technique – all interconnected.</p><p>Qin Sang’s action was equivalent to simultaneously modifying the foundation while building the altar, mitigating conflict. This required a cultivator to have a profound understanding of Dharma and the properties of spiritual objects, possessing exquisite control; the slightest discrepancy would lead to failure.</p><p>It was something ordinary people couldn't achieve. Even Qin Sang alone couldn't have succeeded; he only dared to attempt it relying on the Azure Vermillion Dharma Image.</p><p>The facts proved Qin Sang's idea feasible.</p><p>As the talisman successfully embedded into the altar and became one with it, Qin Sang’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>The altar seemed to take on a faint green glow.</p><p>Sensing the altar, Qin Sang intuitively felt that it would change after integrating the Azure Vermillion Thunder, but it was still early, and the changes were not yet obvious.</p><p>Perhaps, this altar, this Divine Thunder Seal, would not only be used to stabilize true essence in the future…</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>With the altar settled, he felt relieved and continued his tireless cultivation.</p><p>During Qin Sang’s secluded cultivation, the outside world had changed dramatically.</p><p>The Dao Court and the Gui Fang Kingdom were engaged in constant warfare, but the speed of this change was unprecedented.</p><p>In Jushan Prefecture, sects and independent cultivators with weak ties to the Dao Court were only belatedly aware of the changes.</p><p>Many Dao Court officials and Daoist cultivators only realized that the battlefield was not in the Yellow Springs Dao, but in the Evil Origin, when the army assembled and marched north.</p><p>The Gui Fang Kingdom had been scheming with the demon gods for years, and the Dao Court had remained largely unresponsive, only engaging in minor skirmishes.</p><p>Many thought that perhaps the divine path was not the right path, that the Dao Court was tacitly consenting, waiting to see the Gui Fang Kingdom's downfall, and that there would be no war.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Dao Court’s response was swift and overwhelming, and the Gui Fang Kingdom reacted fiercely. An earth-shattering battle was looming in the Evil Origin.</p><p>For a time, Jushan Prefecture was filled with anxiety, countless eyes fixed on the north.</p><p>…</p><p>For several months, Qin Sang remained shut away.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang was suddenly awakened. His eyes snapped open, his gaze like lightning, piercing through the stone door and towards the outside world.</p><p>Stabilizing his cultivation, Qin Sang rose to his feet, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly immediately landing on his shoulder.</p><p>With a flash of light, Qin Sang appeared outside the cave, standing in mid-air, facing the entrance to the flower field space.</p><p>A mark had just been destroyed.</p><p>The marks he could sense from within the cave were all near the flower field space. Someone had entered the prefecture's altar, and they weren't far away!</p><p>As he pondered, another mark was lost.</p><p>“Could it be a Dao Court official or a demon from the Gui Fang Kingdom…”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, this was the last thing he wanted to see.</p><p>Others dared not stay long in Jushan Prefecture’s altar, but for him, it was a sanctuary for cultivation, shielding him from external disturbances and providing the necessary spirit medicine.</p><p>Something like the last time was acceptable; he feared most the two major forces wreaking havoc in the altar, even changing its structure.</p><p>This not only affected his search for ascension, but could also damage the flower field formation and his cave.</p><p>Qin Sang performed a hand seal, concealed his aura, and quietly left the flower field, moving towards the location marked by his sigil.</p><p>After a short while, Qin Sang sensed another sigil had been disturbed, his mind instantly outlining the intruder's path.  The person was merely passing through, not targeting him directly.</p><p>Qin Sang had placed his sigils in hidden areas within illusions, places where anyone entering the illusion would inevitably trigger them. These three sigils were in a straight line, and the intervals between their disturbances were very short.</p><p>The intruder proceeded in a straight line, moving swiftly and appearing completely at ease.  This was the first time Qin Sang had detected another person's presence in the area during his long tenure here, indicating the person was not a returning visitor.</p><p>These signs strongly suggested the newcomer possessed formidable strength!</p><p>…</p><p>Within the void, numerous giant boulders floated.  These boulders, resembling fragments of a shattered mountain, were held in place by an unknown force, constantly drifting yet unable to touch the ground.</p><p>Smaller rocks and even dust surrounded the larger boulders, forming vast bands of dust, all revolving around the central, largest boulder.</p><p>Figures, some seven or eight people, appeared at the edge of the boulders.  As they leaped onto one, a cry of alarm rang out from the front.</p><p>One of them, losing their footing, slammed headfirst onto the boulder's surface, clinging tightly as they endured a terrifying suction force.</p><p>Then, blood seeped from their skin, pooling on the boulder's surface as their bodies visibly withered.  However, these individuals were exceptionally strong and remained calm in the face of danger, using their abilities to forcibly lift themselves from the boulder's surface.</p><p>Their companions rushed to help, a small banner appearing in the void.  The banner's light bathed them, greatly reducing the pressure and allowing them to regain their footing.</p><p>Gathering together, they rested briefly under the banner's protection before continuing their journey.</p><p>As they departed, a figure emerged from the edge of the dust band—Qin Sang.</p><p>Watching their departure, Qin Sang's expression was grave. The intruders were powerful. While Qin Sang hadn't approached too closely, he could confirm they weren't human. They were high-level demonic cultivators, including at least one in the late Transcendence stage.  Even from a distance, he sensed a palpable threat.</p><p>So many Transcendence stage demonic cultivators entering the Sacred Altar, working together with a clear objective...</p><p>Qin Sang's ominous premonition intensified. After a moment's thought, he decided against following them and instead went to assess the situation outside.</p><p>Whether to leave the Sacred Altar, take advantage of the chaos, or retreat to his cave abode—he needed a clearer understanding of the situation before deciding.</p><p>Turning outward, Qin Sang's face grew increasingly grim.  He sensed numerous disturbed sigils along the way, not just in one direction.  Multiple forces had entered the Sacred Altar.  If the Celestial Court officials had also arrived, and possessed similar strength to the demonic cultivators, a major upheaval was inevitable!</p><p>Reaching the outer area, Qin Sang stopped at the former location of one of his sigils and surveyed the surroundings.  He hadn't encountered anyone here, leaving him uncertain about the Celestial Court's involvement. He could only choose a direction and follow the trail. However, with the situation unclear, rash involvement seemed unwise.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then suddenly turned towards the entrance of the Sacred Altar. This incursion was even larger than the last; there must be accomplices outside the Sacred Altar. The strength of those accomplices would provide valuable clues.</p><p>With that, Qin Sang immediately set off, traversing the Nine-Curve Star River, confirming there were no unusual signs outside before entering the Golden Hall.</p><p>The Golden Hall appeared normal.  However, upon entering, Qin Sang felt a chilling killing intent, as if he’d entered a battlefield—a sensation he'd never experienced before.</p><p>Yet, no one was there.</p><p>He exercised extreme caution, employing various secret techniques and artifacts to conceal his aura and form, moving stealthily through the Golden Hall.  He saw no cultivators or demonic cultivators along the way.</p><p>Reaching the exit of the Sacred Altar unhindered, Qin Sang chose a cloud path and entered the auspicious clouds.</p><p>Shortly into his journey through the clouds, Qin Sang froze, instinctively retreating.  Through his Celestial Eye Butterfly, he caught a glimpse of the outside world.</p><p>His face instantly turned ashen.</p><p>Outside the Sacred Altar, dark clouds blotted out the sky.  Behind the dark clouds, golden rays of light shone, accompanied by lightning and thunder, and countless other ominous signs.</p><p>To the east, the dark clouds were clearly infused with demonic energy.  As the clouds shifted, countless strangely shaped figures marched in formation, banners waving.</p><p>The other direction was no less alarming; in addition to demonic soldiers, there were also Taoist figures. Among the demonic soldiers, there were even lights emanating from the Sacred Altar, like towering platforms stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Both sides, their arrival unnoticed, stood facing each other across the plains before the Sacred Altar, poised for a clash.</p><p>Behind both armies, unnatural phenomena continued incessantly. Qin Sang immediately recognized the celestial signs as being caused by Void Refinement stage cultivators!</p><p>Armies massed, Void Refinement cultivators personally overseeing the situation.</p><p>This turn of events far surpassed his expectations.
