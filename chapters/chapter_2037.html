<h1>Chapter 2028: Striking First</h1><p>For some reason, the surrounding void was also trembling, and the fluctuations from the Qianjun Ring hadn't completely subsided. This indicated that the scattered spatial fragments here were likely more than just the one.</p><p>However, the Qianjun Ring's fluctuations were now very faint, far less clear than the recently retrieved fragment. This might be because the other fragments were too small or severely damaged.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wanted to retrieve all the fragments, but the current situation prevented him from considering that.  He collected his thoughts, surveyed his surroundings, and furrowed his brow.</p><p>On the vast sea, distant island silhouettes were faintly visible.  The sky was shrouded in thick, dark clouds.</p><p>The clouds hung incredibly low, devoid of thunder and lightning, only the deepest darkness.  They exerted immense pressure; even with Qin Sang's cultivation, he couldn't completely ignore this feeling and knew there was undoubtedly unknown danger within the clouds.</p><p>Fortunately, since entering the archipelago, the clouds had remained this way, without actively attacking them.</p><p>But at that moment, the earth trembled, and waves rose in the sea. As the tremors intensified, waves several meters high appeared everywhere.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A large wave crashed toward him.</p><p>Qin Sang stood still, unmoving. Just as the wave was about to hit him, it suddenly split, neatly avoiding him.</p><p>Similar scenes repeated.  Qin Sang remained completely dry, looking up at the sky.  The dark clouds above were also in turmoil, churning violently.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't pinpoint when the tremors began, only that it coincided with the Qianjun Ring's anomaly.  Could the tremors originate from the ring?</p><p>While it seemed like the earth was trembling, they were actually within an array.  It was likely that some change had occurred within the grand array.  The retrieval of a small-world fragment by the Qianjun Ring, such a significant event, could easily destabilize the array's foundation.</p><p>“Could it be causing the array to collapse…?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>The Xin family had dispatched so many experts, daring to invite two Nascent Soul cultivators. Their scheme must be significant. They couldn't possibly be after the Qianjun Ring alone; this place certainly held other unknown secrets.</p><p>These secrets might be related to the Qianjun Ring.  Destroying them would be a great loss.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the mysterious hall and altar within the Qianjun Ring's space, perhaps holding hidden secrets. Unfortunately, he could only stay inside for a very short time each visit, then had to exit and wait for the space to stabilize before re-entering.  He didn't have time to investigate now.</p><p>As his thoughts raced, the surrounding phenomena grew increasingly terrifying.</p><p>Above and below, raging waves were everywhere, and the black clouds swirled wildly, as if the sky was about to collapse, ready to destroy everything at any moment.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang sensed something, turning to look back the way they came.</p><p>To his astonishment, the phenomenon on the horizon was even more striking.  Black clouds formed like black dragons or celestial rivers, surging endlessly.</p><p>The boundless black clouds surged forward, swallowing the island shadows. It appeared that a more violent change was occurring on the outer perimeter of the array; the collapse would begin from the outside.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang felt a strong sense of foreboding.</p><p>This place was likely about to collapse, making it extremely dangerous. It wasn’t a matter of obtaining treasures anymore, but of escaping with their lives.</p><p>If the array destroyed, Qin Sang's current location would leave him with no time to escape.</p><p>“At the moment of destruction, can I hide in the Qianjun Ring to seek refuge?”</p><p>Learning that the Qianjun Ring was a fragment of a small world, Qin Sang considered this possibility.</p><p>He put the Qianjun Ring back on his right thumb, subconsciously turning it. However, he wasn’t placing all his hope on the ring alone. He looked around, searching for a hiding place.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang had left alone.  The attendant Pei and the Xin family cultivators, having left the canyon, were completely unaware of what was happening.</p><p>After leaving, they had been hunting for Spirit Jade.</p><p>A large group of them swept their sharp gazes across the surroundings, not missing a single opportunity. Even if the Spirit Jade could hide in the void, they couldn’t escape so many eyes. Unexpectedly, they found nothing after searching for a while.</p><p>The Xin Clan’s young master at the front suddenly stopped.  Everyone thought they had finally found a Spirit Jade, but when they caught up, they found nothing. Only the young master had a furrowed brow and a serious expression.</p><p>“Xin Sheng, what's wrong?”</p><p>Attendant Pei, who had been lagging behind, seemingly unconcerned with the Spirit Jade, stepped forward and asked.</p><p>The young master shook his head slightly and said gravely, “Searching like this is too slow! And those Spirit Jade won't stay in one place; they move around.”</p><p>Even if the array map only showed the outer area, it was still extremely vast. It would take a considerable amount of time to cover the entire perimeter.</p><p>Pei’s eyes flashed with meaningful intent.  “You want to search separately?”</p><p>“Exactly!”</p><p>Xin Sheng scanned the Xin family cultivators. “We must find enough Spirit Jade as soon as possible to give to Elder Qin for refining the crossing boat.”</p><p>"Luo Bo, the First and Second Elders, each of you take a team and search separately."</p><p>Luo, the steward, was immediately alarmed.  "Master ordered me before leaving to never stray from the Young Master's side..."</p><p>Others echoed his concern.</p><p>Young Master Xin waved his hand, interrupting the steward. "We've been here a while, have we encountered any danger?  This area should be safe; Yu Ling's concealment technique is extraordinary. Others might be deceived, but with Luo Bo and the two Elders here, we'll be perfectly safe. As for me, I have Mingling protecting me.  Luo Bo, what is there to worry about?  Third Elder, please accompany me and act as my protector."</p><p>Everyone looked towards a young man.</p><p>The young man, dressed in white robes, appeared youthful, yet his brow held a weariness that belied his appearance.  He paused slightly, then leaped forward, bowing. "Yes! Steward Luo, rest assured, I will ensure the Young Master's safety."</p><p>Generations in a family appear every twenty years or so. Cultivators have varying levels of talent and opportunities, leading to differences in cultivation speed. High-level cultivators live long lives, making seniority a complex issue.</p><p>Therefore, many families have positions such as Elders in the Xin family, who are appointed from among the Metamorphosis cultivators and assist the family head in decision-making.</p><p>The Third Elder is, by seniority, Xin Sheng's grandfather and the previous family head's uncle, but they address each other by their titles.</p><p>The Xin family has no family head, only a Young Master.  However, the Third Elder shows no disrespect to the Young Master.</p><p>Xin Sheng, though called Young Master, is effectively the family head.  He took an oath to fulfill the last family head’s wishes before taking the position—it wasn't due to lack of authority.</p><p>The Xin family is completely loyal to their Young Master.</p><p>First, the Young Master successfully controls Mingling, the family's strongest power and one of the marks of the family head.  </p><p>Second, the sudden death of the previous family head left a power vacuum, with the loyal retainer Pei's intentions unclear, and powerful enemies looming.  In this crisis, the Young Master skillfully navigated the dangerous situation with Pei and their enemy, preserving the Xin family—a feat no one else could match.</p><p>Seeing the Young Master's resolve, Steward Luo didn't object.  They divided their forces into five groups, including Pei.</p><p>"Senior Pei, should I assign someone to assist you?" asked Young Master Xin.</p><p>Pei scoffed. "Except for you, everyone else would only hinder me."</p><p>No one dared to speak, quietly dispersing.</p><p>"I'll go ahead!"</p><p>The Young Master bowed, then, accompanied by the Third Elder, departed in the designated direction.</p><p>Watching the Young Master's back, then glancing at the direction Luo and the others went, a hint of suspicion flashed in Pei's eyes, followed by a cold smile and a snort.  He vanished into thin air.</p><p>"I'll focus on using Mingling to sense ahead. The sides and rear are up to you, Third Elder," the Young Master said, turning his head.</p><p>The Third Elder immediately agreed, staying more than ten meters behind.  He made a hand gesture, a puff of grey smoke appearing behind him, forming a grey eyeball that slowly rotated, its gaze revealing an eerie glow as it watched behind them.  Simultaneously, a flash of green light briefly emanated from the Third Elder's sleeve—a jade bracelet—then vanished without a trace, unnoticed by the Young Master ahead.</p><p>The two flew across the sea, one following the other.</p><p>The divided forces quickly proved effective.  Soon, the Young Master discovered Yu Ling's presence. Mingling leaped from behind her, striking at empty space.</p><p>‘*Puff!*’</p><p>Yu Ling, forced into the open, had no time to escape. Shadows surrounded her, twisting and growing strange claws that lunged at her.</p><p>Yu Ling fought back desperately, but could not escape.  A claw seized her arm, and the others attacked relentlessly, engulfing her in shadows.</p><p>The shadows receded, presenting a jade chip to Young Master Xin.  Encouraged by their success, they continued forward.</p><p>Islands were left behind, yet they found no other Yu Ling.  The Young Master remained focused and calm.</p><p>Then, the Young Master stopped, making a soft sound of surprise.</p><p>"Young Master, what is it?" The Third Elder caught up.</p><p>"I sense a Yu Ling here, but it seems to be inside the mountain…"</p><p>The Young Master gazed at the island ahead—steep, rocky, and craggy.  After circling half the island, they spotted a narrow cave entrance.</p><p>Young Master Xin smiled faintly.  "This Jade Spirit was hidden so well. Fortunately, I had Mingling's help…"</p><p>With that, the two entered the cave.  They found the cave interior to be narrow, winding, and full of countless branches, but under Mingling's keen perception, the Jade Spirit could not escape. After navigating countless tunnels, they finally found the Jade Spirit deep underground.</p><p>They retrieved the jade piece and returned the way they came.</p><p>As they reached the cave mouth, Young Master Xin was about to step out when she suddenly sensed something.  Her footsteps halted abruptly, her gaze sharp as she scanned the outside.</p><p>The scene outside remained unchanged: a black sky, a black sea, hazy mountain silhouettes, and an empty void—nothing seemed amiss.</p><p>Yet Young Master Xin's expression changed drastically. She cried out, "Not good!" and retreated swiftly.</p><p>Third Elder, still unaware of what was happening, felt a sudden tremor.  A thick fog, seemingly appearing from nowhere, instantly enveloped the entire cave.</p><p>The fog was scalding hot, possessing an unusual burning power, like a raging fire searing their bodies.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a powerful force pressed down on them. Young Master Xin and Third Elder felt their breath catch in their throats.  A thunderous roar followed, the cave ceiling collapsed, and rocks rained down as they were violently thrown out, finding the outside world shrouded in thick fog.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A red shadow flashed through the fog, the elemental energy of the heavens violently shaking. A gigantic fiery whip, carrying a terrifying aura, lashed out at Young Master Xin.</p><p>This whip seemed capable of shattering the void. If Young Master Xin and Third Elder were struck, they would surely die!</p><p>The crisis arrived unexpectedly. Young Master Xin hurriedly used Mingling as a shield. A 'poof' sounded as the whip struck Mingling directly. The flames fiercely tore through the shadow. Although it did not pierce Mingling's body, it left a shocking wound, burning with intense red flames, like Mingling's blood.</p><p>"Officer Pei, what are you doing?!"</p><p>Young Master Xin demanded sharply, her face expressing disbelief.</p><p>Third Elder was even more astonished and suspicious.</p><p>This attack came from their own Xin family's Officer Pei!</p><p>Officer Pei had attacked them, a surprise attack, and it seemed a formation had been set up around them.</p><p>"Heh heh…"</p><p>A figure emerged from the fog, followed by Officer Pei's cold laughter. "This girl, your schemes are quite deep. You tried to use a divided force to deceive my vision. But you forgot one thing: brute strength conquers all! I don't care about your plots, your agreements with Qin, I just need to capture you, and the truth will be revealed! That thing in your possession, even if it’s not the jade disc, is certainly something of great importance here.  You really thought you could hide it from my eyes?"</p><p>The success of a plan hinges on the opponent following the planner's lead. Officer Pei, however, had the power to simply overturn the table.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Mingling let out a shrill cry.</p><p>The searing flames inflicted unbearable pain, but Mingling was no weakling. Its shadow writhed, the wound instantly healed, and its form swelled, reaching towards the heavens.</p><p>But Officer Pei had more tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>The fog churned, countless fiery rings appearing, like shackles, descending from the air.</p><p>Looking at the ferocious Mingling, Officer Pei sneered.  "Did you think I didn't know that your Xin family controls Mingling using blood sacrifices?  Along the way, Mingling must have absorbed a great deal of blood, you hid its weakness quite well. But how many more times can Mingling act? My Yuan Yang Wuji Formation has been prepared for you for a long time!"</p><p>Young Master Xin's face was now filled with horror.</p><p>She thought she had hidden everything perfectly, but her secrets were already exposed, a feeling of utter despair washing over her.</p><p>This was a misunderstanding, she and Elder Qin had no special agreement, but any explanation would be futile. Officer Pei had already broken ties and would undoubtedly strike without mercy; there was no turning back.</p><p>"You swore an oath with Father. Aren’t you afraid of the repercussions?" Young Master Xin grasped at a last straw.</p><p>"Rest assured, I will capture you alive, sparing your life.  I still have uses for you and the Xin family."</p><p>Officer Pei's tone was playful, his victory assured.</p><p>Third Elder stood behind Young Master Xin. After his initial panic, he gradually regained his composure.</p><p>His expression was anxious, but his eyes held a calm that most people lacked.  He appeared to be standing beside Young Master Xin, fighting against the enemy, but subtly glanced beyond the fog, his voice filled with resentment. "Young Master, when the old Patriarch was still alive, I saw through this man's treachery. Now he finally reveals his fangs! This man is ambitious and ruthless; pleading is useless. We must fight with all our might. If Elder Qin and Grand Elder sense the disturbance and come to our aid, we may still have a chance!"</p>
