<h1>Chapter 1434: Divine Sense Manifestation</h1><p>Buddhist body cultivator martial arts.</p><p>It must have been obtained at the Pure Ocean Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the information Tan Hao had investigated previously. The Pure Ocean Sect was struck by a fire torrent, and some treasures were washed out before its destruction.</p><p>It's normal for someone to obtain body cultivator martial arts at the Nascent Soul stage and, unable to use it themselves or find a suitable buyer, bring it to the Myriad Demons Assembly to trade.</p><p>Body cultivators are too rare in this era!</p><p>This is not only because body cultivation techniques are scarce and lost, but also because the cultivation difficulty for body cultivators in the present world far exceeds that of Qi Refiners. Even body cultivators at the Golden Core stage are extremely rare.</p><p>Unless one can be like Qin Sang, directly drawing upon the inexhaustible power of the stars to temper the body without fear of astral demon  erosion.</p><p>Even in the Small Cold Domain, where rare spiritual medicines occasionally appear, and even throughout the entire Northern Chen Domain, Qin Sang has dealt with most of the Nascent Souls, yet he hasn't seen a single pure body cultivator!</p><p>Of course, there are those who cultivate both body and Qi.</p><p>There are primarily two reasons for this.</p><p>First, the essence, Qi, and spirit all contribute to breaking through bottlenecks. Nascent Soul cultivators should all have similar insights and will try this path.</p><p>Second, to enhance their physical body in case of some extreme situation.</p><p>However, they eventually discover that doing so consumes too much energy but yields little effect, making it not worth the effort. Moreover, those ordinary body cultivation techniques cannot satisfy their requirements.</p><p>Therefore, their cultivation is usually not very high.</p><p>Martial arts.</p><p>Qin Sang prefers to call them Martial Dao Divine Abilities; top-tier Martial Dao Divine Abilities are even rarer than body cultivation techniques.</p><p>He has cultivated the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* to the Fourth Transformation; his physical body is no less than that of a transformed great demon, but the technique itself only provides one Divine Ability, the Heavenly Demon Transformation, which enhances the physical body and generates phoenix wings; and the Heavenly Demon Dharma Idol , whose true function remains unclear to this day.</p><p>If he doesn't use magic treasures and Daoist arts and relies solely on his body cultivation abilities, he would be no match for a demon king of the same rank.</p><p>The reason is that Qin Sang doesn't know any Martial Dao Divine Abilities; he has only a powerful physical body but cannot unleash its true power.</p><p>Demon Kings can refine their own bloodline power and master Bloodline Divine Abilities, which humans cannot learn. He had consulted Jing Yu about this and confirmed it.</p><p>This disparity becomes more obvious as the cultivation level increases.</p><p>Qin Sang had tried to purchase some in the Northern Chen Domain but only obtained a few inferior Martial Dao Divine Abilities, which were of little use.</p><p>Of course, with Qin Sang's current cultivation, he could study these Martial Dao Divine Abilities and try to create one himself, but his foundation in the body cultivation path is shallow, having relied on demonic techniques for quick success. He doesn't know how much time and energy it would take to succeed, and he has too many things to do.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't lack methods to deal with enemies, so he didn't pay much attention to it before.</p><p>For him, the greatest benefit of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* is to grant him Thunder Escape  and make his physical body less fragile, to cope with some dangerous situations.</p><p>When passing through the storm belt, the power of his physical body became apparent. Sometimes, he could withstand the storm, otherwise, it wouldn't just be a matter of True Essence exhaustion and the accumulation of impurities from elixirs.</p><p>His cultivation had only just reached the mid-Nascent Soul stage when he set out, which was indeed a bit forced.</p><p>"Buddhist Martial Dao Divine Abilities."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts flickered.</p><p>Since that person put it up for sale without any special instructions, it shouldn't require Buddhist techniques to coordinate with it; any body cultivator can use it.</p><p>He doesn't know if there are any Nascent Soul stage body cultivators in the North Sea. The pressure from competition shouldn't be great, unless demon kings participate, but demon kings place more importance on treasures that enhance their bloodline power.</p><p>Missing this kind of top-tier Martial Dao Divine Ability would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded.</p><p>He looked up and down, unable to find the trading conditions for the *Seven Teachers Buddhist Seal*, and asked Real Person Yin Quan for guidance.</p><p>Real Person Yin Quan said, "The meaning is for us to bring all our possessions when we participate in the Myriad Demons Assembly! As long as you have enough treasures on you, you don't have to worry about not having the opportunity to trade. The trading session on the last day will begin in the morning and continue for an unlimited time, giving the participants ample time to weigh the gains and losses and conduct exchanges. The completion of a single trade may require several or even dozens of handovers. Of course, each exchange must go through the Myriad Demons Assembly, giving them a cut."</p><p>After a trading session, the organizers earn a fortune.</p><p>With so much order, it always feels that the name 'Myriad Demons Assembly' is a bit incongruous. Those who don't know might think the backers are from the Righteous Path forces.</p><p>The predecessors who founded the Myriad Demons Assembly had great foresight.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to the other treasures on the list. He had not yet decided whether to participate in the Myriad Demons Assembly. He would wait until he refined the Concealed Fragrance Pill  before deciding.</p><p>Three star feathers of a Star Herding Bird.</p><p>Heavenly Meteorite Iron.</p><p>The Ancient Demonic Sect's Cold Bone Dao sacred object, the Cold Bone Demonic Hand.</p><p>…</p><p>One by one, treasures that are hard to find in this era dazzled the eyes.</p><p>The Myriad Demons Assembly is indeed the greatest event in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to return and refine the Concealed Fragrance Pill, asking where he should go if he wanted to visit Real Person Yin Quan before the Myriad Demons Assembly.</p><p>Real Person Yin Quan gave him a Pill Cauldron Token, "Friends can go to Pearl Island and activate this token, and someone will come to pick you up."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the location of Pearl Island, cupped his hands in salute, and took his leave.</p><p>Flying out of Blue Star Island, Qin Sang rushed back to his cave abode. He opened the restrictions and went inside, just in time to see Tan Hao worshipping Tan Jie. When leaving the Pure Ocean Sect, Tan Hao brought out Tan Jie's coffin, lest his younger brother's remains be lost forever.</p><p>Letting Tan Hao inquire about the two major events, Huang Longshi's palace and the Myriad Demons Assembly, Qin Sang entered the cave abode, closed the restrictions, and told Tan Hao that he was not to be disturbed under any circumstances.</p><p>He sat down in meditation.</p><p>A black flame floated out from the center of Qin Sang's brow, and the Fire Lotus Seed appeared.</p><p>Gradually, the fluctuations on the Fire Lotus Seed became exceptionally stable, quietly floating in front of Qin Sang's chest.</p><p>He didn't know how much time passed.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed out a long sigh of relief, adjusting his state to the best, and took the Fire Lotus Seed into his body.</p><p>*Pa!*</p><p>The jade bottle placed beside him opened on its own, and the Concealed Fragrance Pill flew in front of Qin Sang, its fragrance overflowing.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at it for a moment, opened his mouth, and swallowed it!</p><p>As the spiritual pill entered his stomach, the medicinal power immediately transformed into a cool stream, merging into his body. Qin Sang only felt his spiritual platform clear for a moment, with a sense of ethereal bliss.</p><p>…</p><p>Four months later.</p><p>*Creak!*</p><p>The door to the quiet chamber was pushed open, and Qin Sang stepped out.</p><p>He looked around, and in his eyes, there seemed to be an unprecedentedly brilliant light flashing, which quickly subsided.</p><p>Finding that Tan Hao was not there, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, flew directly out of the cave abode, recalled the location of a deserted sea area, and soared into the air.</p><p>Before long.</p><p>On the empty sea surface, Qin Sang's figure silently emerged.</p><p>His actions were a bit strange. He closed his eyes slightly, seeming to comprehend something, and then the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. "The range of perception is nearly double that of before. Is this the benefit of Divine Sense Manifestation?"</p><p>As soon as his voice fell, Qin Sang's thoughts stirred slightly, and he suddenly released his divine sense, and a powerful aura left his body.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The color of the wind and clouds on the sea changed, and the nearly substantial Astral Winds  transformed into streams of Qi, visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Confirming that there was no one around, Qin Sang no longer cared about anything, completely releasing his divine sense, allowing it to sweep across this space, triggering all kinds of strange phenomena.</p><p>*Rumble...*</p><p>Qin Sang calmly looked at the celestial phenomena, using it to analyze how much benefit and change the Divine Sense Manifestation had brought him.</p>
