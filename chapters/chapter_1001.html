<h1>Chapter 993: Ancient Restriction</h1><p>“Having the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn doesn't mean you can rest easy.  If you sense the horn's power weakening or blurring, don't go any deeper. A powerful demon king almost got lost in there…”</p><p>Yuan Zhu warned, handing the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn to Qin Sang.</p><p>“Thank you, Daoist Yuan… Until we meet again!”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly tested the horn, then bowed to Yuan Zhu before vanishing into the storm.</p><p>Yuan Zhu watched Qin Sang leave, then glanced at the jade slip in his hand, his eyes filled with intense eagerness. He couldn’t wait to return to his cave and study the cultivation technique.</p><p>Qin Sang weaved through the hurricane, heading straight for the heart of the storm.</p><p>He opened his palm, revealing the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn.</p><p>The small horn rested in his palm, bringing a wave of coolness.</p><p>“You really guessed right,”</p><p>Bai’s weary voice echoed. He was nearly exhausted and hadn’t recovered,  “The Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn should be enough to shake off Old Devil Mu. But don’t be careless. I remember you said there might be spatial rifts deep within the storm.”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in agreement. “Though I’ve never been to the storm's depths, I’ve seen the terrifying spatial rifts in the Xiaohan Region’s ancient immortal battlefield.  They’re likely here too. Thankfully, the Sky-Eye Butterfly can help me.  It can warn me of most spatial rifts, allowing me to avoid them. The most dangerous, invisible ones are rare unless you go extremely deep.”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang awakened the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The butterfly emerged.</p><p>Sensing its master’s urgency, it gently touched Qin Sang’s chin with its soft wings, silently comforting him before settling on his shoulder. It activated its Sky-Eye abilities, alert to any potential danger.</p><p>Feeling the butterfly’s reassuring thoughts, Qin Sang’s expression softened, his anxiety easing.</p><p>The fire curse flared again.</p><p>It was hard to determine the storm’s effect on the curse in the short term.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the incantation Yuan Zhu had given him, activating the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn.</p><p>As true energy flowed into it, the horn’s glow intensified, emitting a soft, moonlit radiance. Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, carefully sensing the uncanny resonance, guiding him forward.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the storm.</p><p>The chase continued.</p><p>Old Devil Mu’s face was grim. He had a strong feeling he’d miscalculated.</p><p>The prey’s decisiveness was shocking.</p><p>If they went a little further, even Old Devil Mu would worry about getting lost. He hadn’t anticipated this outcome; he possessed no treasure to navigate the storm.</p><p>His prey, seemingly reckless, charged deeper into the storm without hesitation.</p><p>Worse, the storm was interfering with the fire curse’s accuracy.</p><p>Old Devil Mu had to continuously and intensely activate the curse to barely sense his prey’s approximate location. It was inefficient and time-consuming.</p><p>Additionally, his earlier pursuit had heavily depleted his blood essence due to prolonged use of the blood escape technique. His brief rest on the island had only temporarily suppressed his injuries, not fully healed them.</p><p>This weakness forced him to stop and recover periodically, significantly slowing his pace.</p><p>The prey was clearly aware of this and dared to evade him.</p><p>The fire curse appeared.</p><p>It lingered for a long time before fading.</p><p>As soon as the curse dissipated, Qin Sang abruptly changed direction.</p><p>The chase resumed.</p><p>The Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn’s glow had dimmed slightly.</p><p>This area was a chaotic mix of spirit tides and hurricanes, rife with spatial rifts. Some were hundreds of feet long, with several intersecting, posing extreme danger.</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously navigated the treacherous gaps, noticing Old Devil Mu’s noticeably slower speed.  A plan formed in his mind: a game of cat and mouse.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Old Devil Mu, too, was wary, fearing he would get lost. His ability to sense his prey through the fire curse was increasingly unreliable, only providing a general location.</p><p>At this rate, catching his prey was impossible.</p><p>Old Devil Mu could only hope his prey would eventually exhaust their elixirs and collapse, so he stubbornly trailed behind.</p><p>Qin Sang, on the other hand, grew increasingly composed.</p><p>He even used moments when Old Devil Mu was recovering to slow his own pace, refining impurities in his body, calming his agitated true energy, taking elixirs, and absorbing spirit stones, no longer wasting his Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>Bai Su, regaining consciousness, said, "I can barely manage to solidify the fire curse seal. I'll seal the curse first and lose him…"</p><p>Bai, having partially recovered their depleted spiritual energy, recombined the fire curse seal, suppressing the curse.  Simultaneously, Qin Sang chose a direction and fled.</p><p>Reaching an unfamiliar sea area, Qin Sang felt a wave of relief; they had finally shaken off Old Master Mou.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure of their exact location, but thankfully, possessing the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn, they didn't lose their way.</p><p>Completely eliminating the internal fire curse would require Bai's full recovery.</p><p>Bai retracted the seal and went into seclusion to recover.</p><p>Qin Sang flew aimlessly through the storm, trying to put as much distance as possible between himself and Old Master Mou.</p><p>To his surprise, the fire curse showed intermittent activity, indicating that Old Master Mou hadn't given up, though he could no longer sense Qin Sang's location.</p><p>The storm zone offered no respite. Though fatigued, Qin Sang had ample supplies. He slowed his flight, gradually refining impurities from his True Essence while continuing his aimless journey through the storm.</p><p>It was a unique experience. Without the protection of powerful cultivators, directly confronting the might of nature allowed him to truly appreciate his own insignificance.</p><p>Qin Sang decided against leaving immediately, lest he inadvertently encounter Old Master Mou again.  He planned to return to the Canglang Sea after removing the fire curse and eliminating the threat.</p><p>Over half a month into their journey through the storm…</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly suddenly transmitted a peculiar sensation.  Qin Sang's attention was caught. Following the butterfly's guidance, he looked into the distance, then suddenly accelerated.</p><p>With practiced ease, he expertly navigated the surging spiritual currents and hurricanes. After a few swift movements, he abruptly stopped, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>Before him, a pillar of light shot from the seabed to the sky.</p><p>Amidst the chaotic spiritual tides and turbulent waves, the light column remained clearly visible, albeit somewhat distorted.</p><p>"What is this...?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled seeing a similar sight on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>An ancient restriction had been triggered!</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted.  After so long in the storm, this was his first encounter with an ancient restriction. This place might well be a similar ancient cultivator's abode.</p><p>In a flash, he appeared before the light column, looking down towards its source.</p><p>The ancient restriction might conceal an ancient cultivator's dwelling, or it could harbor unknown dangers.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang decided to take a chance. He was extremely fatigued, pushing himself to his limits. Finding a safe place to rest was a priority.</p>
