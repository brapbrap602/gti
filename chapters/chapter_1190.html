<h1>Chapter 1182: The Battle Begins</h1><p>"Fellow Daoist, you can actually see through Zenling's concealment technique!"</p><p>Jing Lin's expression shifted slightly.</p><p>Zenling Daoist was a figure of considerable renown. Anyone who faced him in battle found him to be an extremely tricky opponent. This man was exceedingly cunning, and whenever he encountered a true expert like the old Daoist Zhenyi, he would always slip away without a trace.</p><p>If one's strength was inferior to Zenling Daoist, there was simply no way to fight him. Zenling could retreat at any moment, ensuring he remained undefeated.</p><p>Yet, a newly advanced demon cultivator who had just achieved human form was able to easily see through Zenling's movements!</p><p>And it wasn't a coincidence. From the tone of Demon King Mingyue earlier, it seemed Zenling was utterly exposed in his presence.</p><p>Jing Lin recalled how both he and Si Di had been greatly disappointed upon learning the origins of their ally. Only now did they realize they had underestimated this Demon King Mingyue.</p><p>"My abilities happen to counter such concealment techniques," Qin Sang explained calmly.</p><p>Jing Lin, who had initially been somewhat flustered, now wore an expression of excitement. "That old thief Zenling has finally met his match!"</p><p>He immediately sent a mental message to Si Di, informing him of the situation.</p><p>"How much do you two know about Zenling?" Qin Sang asked, remaining composed.</p><p>Even though Zenling's concealment technique had been countered, he was still a formidable mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>With three against three, maintaining the Cold Bell Formation wouldn't be too difficult. The real challenge lay in how to repel or even defeat their opponents. A prolonged battle would lead to an uncertain outcome!</p><p>It was certain that their previously devised tactics were now useless.</p><p>With Zenling present and Pei the Demon manipulating the Dark Crystal Tower for support, there was almost no chance for a sneak attack.</p><p>If there were a Nascent Soul cultivator controlling the Cold Bell Formation, it might provide some assistance. But now, with only a Golden Core cultivator at the helm, it was already a struggle to avoid exposing any weaknesses, let alone offer help.</p><p>"We've been at war with the Sin Abyss for so long that we've gained some understanding of their Nascent Soul cultivators. Aside from that mysterious treasure, Zenling has never displayed any other powerful abilities. However, he is still a mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator..." Jing Lin's joy faded. No Nascent Soul demon could be underestimated, and no one knew if Zenling had any hidden trump cards. More often than not, before things reached a life-and-death struggle, Zenling would calmly withdraw.</p><p>"So, Fellow Daoist, you don't have full confidence either? It seems our options are either to abandon the plan, hold our ground, and wait for reinforcements, or to devise another strategy," Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>Jing Lin was unwilling. "We finally have an ally who can counter Zenling, giving us the upper hand. It would be a shame to give up now!"</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang said, "Zenling and Tan the Demon are attempting to surround Si Di. No matter which one we target, the other and the Dark Crystal Tower will be able to provide timely support. The only one lagging behind is Pei the Demon, who is controlling the Dark Crystal Tower. However, if we turn the tables and target Pei the Demon, Si Di would have to act as bait, enduring the attacks of three Nascent Soul cultivators alone. The risk is immense..."</p><p>"The Sin Abyss has always been extremely protective of the Dark Crystal Tower. The controller can draw power from it, gaining protection, making it difficult to break through from him. However, Pei the Demon doesn't know that the Cold Bell Formation is strong on the outside but weak within. He will surely cooperate fully with Zenling and Tan to hunt Si Di. The moment we strike will be Pei the Demon's most vulnerable moment, presenting an opportunity."</p><p>Jing Lin also hesitated. "As you said, Fellow Daoist, Si Di's situation would be perilous. We must seek his consent."</p><p>After a silent exchange, a glimmer of joy flashed in Jing Lin's eyes. "Si Di is willing to be the bait! He has recently mastered a new ability that can handle such a situation, and it will be a surprise for the Sin Abyss!"</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised that Si Di had agreed. He said solemnly, "We must not betray Si Di's trust. This assassination of Pei the Demon must not fail!"</p><p>Jing Lin nodded. "We only have one chance. Once Pei the Demon and the others react, it will be difficult to harm him again. My life-bound treasure is the Wind-Summoning Bracelet..."</p><p>The two carefully discussed the details, quickly finalizing their plan.</p><p>As they were strategizing, the Sin Abyss army had already pressed forward, charging toward the sea of mist without pause.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Three Dark Crystal Towers landed, rapidly expanding.</p><p>Black light radiated, forming three towering giant towers arranged in a triangular formation on the battlefield, overlooking all cultivators and standing in opposition to the Cold Bell Formation.</p><p>The three giant towers glowed, beams of black light filling the sky and earth, converging into a halo that slowly descended, covering the Sin Abyss cultivators with a faint, shimmering membrane.</p><p>The Sin Abyss cultivators roared in unison, their momentum awe-inspiring.</p><p>Tan the Demon flew at the forefront, leading the charge like a sharp blade, while Pei the Demon and Zenling were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The Sin Abyss cultivators behind him rushed forward, busy with their tasks.</p><p>In the next moment, clusters of light of various colors erupted from the center of their battle formation.</p><p>It appeared that the Sin Abyss's battle formation was even more orderly and disciplined than that of the Two Domains Alliance. These light clusters represented various restrictions, Five Elements Dao techniques, and magical artifacts. Though seemingly chaotic, their coordination was remarkably tight.</p><p>With so much power unleashed, it converged and fused within the Sin Abyss ranks, forming a massive light shield that enveloped everyone, obscuring the membrane from the Dark Crystal Towers.</p><p>They advanced swiftly.</p><p>Tan the Demon glanced left and right, issuing commands from time to time. Streams of light flew out from the battle formation, landing on the ground ahead.</p><p>Then, restriction talismans materialized, the earth split open, and magma and vines surged forth, but all these phenomena quickly dissipated.</p><p>It was clear that the Two Domains cultivators had set traps in advance.</p><p>Unfortunately, such methods were of little use against enemies led by Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Under Tan the Demon's command, the Sin Abyss cultivators swept through the traps like a cleansing tide.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>The Dark Crystal Towers shot out beams of black light, which condensed in the void, transforming into massive, handleless blades of darkness. The enormous blades spanned the sky, and as the cultivators charged forward, the blades swung horizontally, slashing toward the cold mist ahead!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The dark blade cut straight into the cold mist. The collision of the two forces sent terrifying shockwaves rippling out.</p><p>The ground shook violently.</p><p>A clear gap appeared in the cold mist where the blade had passed. The mist thinned significantly, and the surrounding fog surged to fill the void.</p><p>The formation emitted urgent bell chimes.</p><p>The power of the Dark Crystal Towers and the Cold Bell Formation devoured and eroded each other.</p><p>In the central tower, the Golden Core cultivator controlling the formation's artifact paled, gritting his teeth as he held on, following Jing Lin's orders to maintain a defensive stance.</p><p>By now, the Sin Abyss forces could see the Two Domains cultivators through the mist, standing ready for battle.</p><p>They had prepared as soon as they detected the enemy, biding their time for this moment.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>A roar erupted from within the Cold Bell Formation.</p><p>When enemies meet, their eyes blaze with hatred!</p><p>Before the Sin Abyss cultivators could reach the sea of mist, they were met with a dazzling sightâ€”countless blades of light, sword auras, and Five Elements Dao techniques surged forth like a tidal wave from the Two Domains ranks.</p><p>Faced with such an onslaught, even Tan the Demon, a Nascent Soul cultivator, dared not be careless. He quickly retreated.</p><p>Under his guidance, the Sin Abyss cultivators worked together to push the light shield forward, layering it to block the incoming attacks.</p>
