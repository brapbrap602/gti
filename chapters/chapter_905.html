<h1>Chapter 897: A Reunion of Fellow Disciples</h1><p>The elder hurriedly caught the iron token.  Upon inspection, he realized it was a token belonging to a Nascent Soul cultivator from their sect! This person was a senior member of their own sect. The token was genuine, bearing the unique mark of the Azure Caldron Sect, impossible to forge.  The elder and the others were completely stunned.  These disciples came from various peaks of the Azure Caldron Sect, representing both the Five Elements and Yin-Yang branches. They racked their brains but couldn't recall such a senior member within their sect.</p><p>……</p><p>Inside Clarity Island.</p><p>Several Nascent Soul cultivators sat in a bamboo pavilion, enjoying the exotic scenery outside.  Fine wine and spiritual fruits were placed before them as they discussed the Dao, occasional bursts of laughter echoing around them.  The atmosphere seemed very harmonious.</p><p>The bamboo pavilion wasn't large, but there weren't many Nascent Soul cultivators present on Clarity Island. Everyone sat scattered, leaving ample space.  Elder Lu, the head of Azure Peak, and other Golden Core cultivators from the Azure Caldron Sect sat in the center, surrounded like stars around the moon.</p><p>Qin Sang, using the alias Mingyue, sat beside Daoist Moyu, listening more than speaking. He'd already learned quite a few secrets about the various sects on Azure Caldron Island.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue, your cave is on Mount Baogu on Heaven's Rise Island? With your cultivation level, you certainly wouldn't be unknown. Before I took charge of Azure Peak, I often visited Heaven's Rise Island, yet I've never heard of you."</p><p>Elder Lu looked at Qin Sang, curiosity in his voice.</p><p>"I'm but a rogue cultivator, truly an unknown figure.  Before reaching the Nascent Soul stage, I was active in the Demon Sea. Due to the recent chaos there, I had no choice but to relocate to the Inner Sea, renting a cave on Mount Baogu.  I rarely appeared in Heaven's Rise City, so not many know me. It's understandable that Elder Lu hasn't heard of me."</p><p>Qin Sang took a sip of wine, his expression unchanged. He added with a sigh, "I don't know when the turmoil in the Demon Sea will subside. Fortunately, I acted quickly and escaped back to the Inner Sea, but my foundation in the Demon Sea was completely destroyed.  With a troubled mind, I couldn't focus on cultivation, so I decided to travel. Passing by here, I happened to meet Fellow Daoist Moyu and have imposed on him for a few days."</p><p>"The Demon Sea!"</p><p>Elder Lu's expression cleared.  "No wonder Fellow Daoist Moyu speaks so highly of you.  You dared to enter the Demon Sea at the Foundation Establishment stage. I admire your courage."</p><p>Others echoed his sentiment.</p><p>Azure Caldron Island wasn't too far from Heaven's Rise Island. Out of curiosity, they had all visited the Demon Sea and knew the dangers it held.  Hearing that Qin Sang had roamed the Demon Sea alone for so many years, they began to reassess his strength.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. "I was forced to. I envy all of you, with your sect as backing.  Unlike me, reduced to a stray dog after being caught in the crossfire. Elder Lu, I heard from Fellow Daoist Moyu that you are currently defending Desolation Island against the beast horde. Is there any news? When will the beast horde be repelled?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked with feigned urgency.</p><p>Elder Lu's eyes flickered, his suspicion of Qin Sang lessening.  He guessed that this person's visit to Clarity Island was less about observation and more about gathering information on the Demon Sea.</p><p>Seeing that others were also curious, Elder Lu didn't hide anything.  He said calmly, "My adoptive father may be busy; there hasn't been any news recently.  However, I've heard some things about the situation in the Demon Sea from other fellow Daoists. It's said that defending Desolation Island isn't difficult, but as for when the beast horde will retreat, it's hard to say..."</p><p>As he spoke, a streak of light suddenly pierced through the mist and flew directly into the pavilion.</p><p>Elder Lu's expression changed slightly. He flashed to the entrance of the pavilion and caught the streak of light.  Just as he was about to examine it, a muffled sound came from the distance, and the ground trembled.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivators present, with their sharp hearing, vaguely heard a few screams, recognizing them as belonging to the Azure Caldron Sect disciples guarding outside.</p><p>"Who dares trespass on Clarity Island!"</p><p>Old Daoist Huayang's face changed drastically, and he immediately rushed out.</p><p>Elder Lu was even faster; his figure had already disappeared into the mist.</p><p>The others exchanged glances and flew out of the pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang, unconcerned, was the last to leave. If someone dared to provoke the Azure Caldron Sect, he would be happy to see it; the more chaotic the situation, the more beneficial to his plans.</p><p>However, he was also curious about who dared to attack Clarity Island.</p><p>When he arrived at the entrance, he saw Elder Lu and the others confronting three Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The Azure Caldron Sect disciples guarding the entrance lay groaning on the slopes of the surrounding hills.  With their cultivation level, they were clearly no match for the intruders and had all been injured.</p><p>Fortunately, the attackers hadn't killed them.</p><p>The three intruders were strangers. Aside from the youngest, who was slightly weaker, the other two were mid-Nascent Soul cultivators, exuding powerful auras.</p><p>However, Elder Lu's side had over a dozen Nascent Soul cultivators, with Elder Lu himself being a peak late-stage cultivator. The three intruders seemed rather outnumbered.</p><p>Despite the odds, the three remained aggressive and unafraid.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang even more was that Elder Lu and Old Daoist Huayang looked astonished upon seeing the intruders, their expressions strange.</p><p>The leader was a burly man.  He looked at Elder Lu and sneered, "What's wrong, Junior Brother Lu?  Now that you're the head, wielding all the power, you don't recognize your fellow disciples anymore?"</p><p>His words caused an uproar.</p><p>The cultivators from other sects were stunned, holding their magical weapons, unsure whether to retract or attack them.</p><p>They had assumed it was an external enemy, ready to fight together.  Now, hearing the intruder's tone, they realized he was an Azure Caldron Sect disciple. They were momentarily at a loss.</p><p>Everyone looked at Elder Lu for confirmation. He remained silent, his face grim.</p><p>"Are the three fellow Daoists also from the Azure Caldron Sect?  Why have I never seen you?"</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Qi asked.</p><p>A few others looked thoughtful, as if they knew something.</p><p>Elder Lu's gaze sharpened.  He asked sternly, "Senior Brother Gao, you violated the agreement by appearing here and even injured the guarding disciples. What are you trying to do?"</p><p>They were truly Azure Caldron Sect disciples. Could this be internal strife?</p><p>The Azure Caldron Sect was currently controlled by Lu Xiaoyun, but there were actually two Nascent Soul ancestors within the sect, not entirely lacking the power to contend with Lu Xiaoyun's faction.</p><p>However, the other ancestor had been silent for many years, claiming to be in seclusion.</p><p>If this person had awakened, and Lu Xiaoyun happened to be absent...</p><p>Those present were all old monsters who had lived for hundreds of years.  Their imaginations ran wild.</p><p>There was a stir among the crowd as they discreetly put away their magical weapons.  As outsiders, they didn't want to be caught in the crossfire without understanding the situation.</p><p>“A few mere disciples, blind as bats, couldn't even recognize their elders and dared to block our entry.  Couldn’t I teach them a lesson?”</p><p>The burly man sneered with disdain. “We are here, naturally, to reclaim what originally belonged to our Bullfighting Peak lineage, what you have now occupied.  Junior Brother Lu, return those things, and we will leave immediately, never setting foot on Azure Caldron Island again!"</p>
