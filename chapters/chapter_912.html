<h1>Chapter 904: Swift Execution</h1><p>“What’s that?!”</p><p>A Human Golden Core cultivator pointed at the ground and shouted.</p><p>Everyone saw the exposed stone steps, clearly not recently constructed.</p><p>They and the Candor Sect coexisted on Candor Island, and even Brightmoon Island was discovered by their ancestors together with the Candor Sect. Yet no one knew that the island concealed other secrets.</p><p>“What did those Wu Clan people take?”</p><p>They exchanged glances, and simultaneously yelled, “Chase!”</p><p>Both sides pursued each other through the jungle.</p><p>Sword light and saber Qi rose and fell continuously, a torrential downpour of attacks, all blocked by the Beast King Banner.</p><p>Soon, they passed through the Thunderwood Jungle. Seeing the flag formation intact, the Wu Clan cultivators relaxed.  At the same time, the Human Golden Core cultivators also saw the flag formation at the edge of the great formation, and billowing black smoke!</p><p>“Not good, they infiltrated from there! That person is escaping, stop him!”</p><p>Someone pointed at the black-robed figure and shouted urgently.</p><p>But the Beast King Banner and the other Wu Clan cultivators were between them; it was impossible to destroy the flag formation and stop the black-robed man.</p><p>The black-robed man glanced back and sneered.</p><p>The flag formation was within reach. Once inside, he could escape through the passage corroded by the black smoke, then retract the outer flag formation and sever the passage, easily shaking off their pursuers.</p><p>Luring these people here wasn't necessarily a bad thing; his Eldest Senior Brother could easily escape.</p><p>By the time these people circled around to the exit of Brightmoon Island and chased them out, they would be long gone.</p><p>The only thing they exposed this time was the Beast King Banner, but many Wu Clan sects possessed such banners, making it impossible for the Candor Sect to trace them.</p><p>The black-robed man plotted his next move, feeling confident of victory. He plummeted downwards, heading straight for the flag formation.</p><p>Just then, an unexpected change occurred.</p><p>Beside the flag formation, an ordinary-looking Thunderwood tree suddenly erupted with a dazzling sword light without any warning. The tree trembled slightly, then split down the middle, collapsing to the ground.</p><p>The sword light rapidly magnified in the black-robed man's pupils, like a grim reaper, carrying the aura of death.</p><p>Caught by surprise, the black-robed man was both shocked and furious. He never expected someone to be lying in wait there, undetected by any of them.</p><p>The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind!</p><p>This thought flashed through the black-robed man's mind, but he couldn't understand how their seemingly perfect and smoothly executed plan had gone wrong.</p><p>Now wasn't the time to dwell on such matters.</p><p>“Senior Brother, be careful!”</p><p>A cry of alarm came from behind, from his junior brothers.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator was a battle-hardened veteran. Despite his inner turmoil, he remained outwardly calm. Quickly forming hand seals, he spat out a streak of blue light.</p><p>Wrapped within the light was a command arrow.</p><p>With a clang, the arrow flickered, blocking the sword light at the critical moment.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the sword light shimmered and split into over a dozen bright sword beams, each incredibly sharp and indistinguishable, easily bypassing the arrow and shooting towards him.</p><p>“Sword Light Splitting!”</p><p>The black-robed man was enraged, a chill running down his spine.</p><p>Only exceptional Human sword cultivators could comprehend Sword Light Splitting. He had encountered a formidable opponent!</p><p>Unfazed by the danger, the black-robed man released a Gu insect from his body. It turned out that the dragonfly-like Gu insect was his natal Gu.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>As the Gu insect appeared, the black-robed man's face paled, and he spat out a mouthful of vital essence onto the insect.</p><p>The Gu insect emitted a sharp buzzing sound, its body flashing with bloody light. Then, it transformed into a massive phantom, twice the height of a man, completely shielding the black-robed man.</p><p>Simultaneously, the black-robed man retreated rapidly. He knew that as long as his natal Gu stalled the opponent, allowing him to retreat into the Beast King Banner formation, this person would have no chance of harming him.</p><p>However, his natal Gu might be injured in the process.</p><p>He had already forcibly stimulated his natal Gu's potential with his vital essence. If it were severely injured, it might take decades to fully recover.</p><p>But compared to his own life, this was insignificant.</p><p>Just as the sword beams were about to be blocked by the insect phantom, an unbelievable scene unfolded. An inconspicuous blue light suddenly appeared, moving with astonishing speed, surpassing the sword beams and heading straight for the insect phantom.</p><p>It was the Star Conch!</p><p>Before the black-robed man could react, a 'pfft' sound came from within the insect phantom. The massive phantom shattered, and his natal Gu met its demise under the Star Conch, leaving behind a cloud of blood mist, its body obliterated.</p><p>With the death of his natal Gu, the black-robed man felt a tearing pain in his Yuan Shen, causing him to cry out in agony, his face turning deathly pale.</p><p>A natal Gu was connected to its master's mind and spirit. The death of the Gu would severely injure the master.</p><p>“It’s you…”</p><p>The black-robed man pointed at the figure beside the flag formation, his eyes bloodshot.</p><p>He recognized it. This treasure was what had delivered the final blow to his Fourth Junior Brother that day!</p><p>“It is me!”</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.</p><p>The Star Conch, having killed the Gu insect, now advanced alongside the sword light.</p><p>The black-robed man was no pushover. Even in this situation, he refused to give up, still struggling for survival. He retreated rapidly, his hair dishevelled, looking like a madman, muttering incantations, seemingly casting some life-saving technique.</p><p>Then, another unexpected event occurred.</p><p>As the black-robed man was about to pass a Thunderwood tree, a strikingly beautiful butterfly suddenly appeared. With a flap of its wings, countless fine yet powerful lightning bolts shot out, targeting the black-robed man's back.</p><p>Although the Skymoth Eye Butterfly was small, it was still a third-transformation spirit insect. Even the powerful black-robed man dared not take its full-powered attack head-on.</p><p>Already on the verge of death, the black-robed man was focused entirely on dealing with Qin Sang's sneak attack, trying to save his life. He never expected an ambush from behind.</p><p>Moreover, who would have thought that this butterfly possessed such advanced concealment abilities, staying by their side until the final moment to deliver the fatal blow?</p><p>The black-robed man's protective spiritual light was shattered by the lightning. His body stiffened, and the next moment, the Star Conch pierced through his flesh, killing him instantly.</p><p>The black-robed man desperately turned his head, wanting to see who had killed him, but only saw a butterfly's shadow.</p><p>“Skymoth Eye Butterfly! No, that’s not it, it doesn’t look like…”</p><p>This was his final thought.</p><p>The Skymoth Eye Butterfly quickly flapped its wings, swiped at the black-robed man's storage pouch, and flew into Qin Sang's arms.</p><p>Finally seeing its true master, it expressed its joy, wanting to dance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the black-robed man's junior brothers were desperately trying to come to his rescue.</p><p>They were actually very close, but Qin Sang acted decisively with lightning speed. Life and death were decided in an instant, giving them no chance to intervene.</p><p>Qin Sang calmed the excited Skymoth Eye Butterfly, retrieved the Star Conch, and then slashed forward with the Ebony Sword, releasing a powerful sword Qi. Under the shocked and enraged gazes of the others, he retreated into the flag formation.</p><p>Then, with a tap of his foot, he turned and entered the black smoke passage.</p>
