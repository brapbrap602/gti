<h1>Chapter 1581: The Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation</h1><p>The Ullambana and Zhongyuan Dharma Assemblies are essentially the same, with largely similar procedures.</p><p>Of course, Buddhism and Taoism differ, so the specifics of the assemblies will naturally have many distinctions.</p><p>The so-called "first-class event" is only relative to the sects of the Nineteen Rain-Kissed States; cultivators and independent practitioners from the Northern Wasteland, Western Desert, and Eastern Sea are not eligible to participate, only to observe.</p><p>Even so, it still attracts many cultivators to attend.</p><p>The assembly features magical battles, discussions, and a wide array of cultivation arts, making it an excellent opportunity for exchange.</p><p>However, these are secondary.</p><p>The sects of the Nineteen Rain-Kissed States place the greatest importance on the assembly, as each one is a chance to redistribute resources, even influencing the Central Plains' layout for the next five hundred years.</p><p>Since they're called the Ullambana and Zhongyuan Assemblies, they are naturally led by the Ganlu Zen Monastery and the Eight Scenic Spots respectively.</p><p>The location, however, is not fixed and rotates among the nineteen states.  Each time a state hosts it, the local sects must fully cooperate.</p><p>Weaker states, like the Seven Western States gradually incorporated into the Central Plains, lack the strength to host alone and can co-host.</p><p>Hosting the assembly has countless benefits, and the sects that obtain the qualification are more than happy to do so, including the demonic sects.</p><p>The Tian Hao Tower, the foremost demonic sect in the Central Plains, is located in the Six Jiangzuo States alongside the Eight Scenic Spots and Ganlu Zen Monastery, so their relationship is not exactly amicable, yet they cooperated with the Eight Scenic Spots in hosting a Zhongyuan Assembly.</p><p>During the assembly, a harmonious atmosphere prevailed.</p><p>Qin Sang learned from Jiang Mu that the next Ullambana Assembly is less than eighty years away.</p><p>This assembly will be held in Jinyu State, one of the four northern states.</p><p>The Jinyu Sect is incredibly wealthy and influential, reportedly having already announced its extensive preparations for an unprecedentedly grand assembly, with all expenses covered solely by the Jinyu Sect, without burdening other forces in Jinyu State.</p><p>"Is Bu Nian Mountain's century-long closure a sign they won't participate in the Ullambana Assembly? Or will they just send a few disciples to go through the motions? Or has Situ Yu foreseen potential changes in this assembly and is pessimistic about the future...?"</p><p>Qin Sang's first thought was of Bu Nian Mountain.</p><p>Situ Yu's decision to close the mountain at this time was undoubtedly well-considered.</p><p>"The Ullambana Assembly will be a crucial turning point!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought.</p><p>The hidden forces and the sects with their own agendas are likely all waiting for the Ullambana Assembly.</p><p>Past assemblies have seen many instances of Nascent Soul cultivators making their presence known.</p><p>In recent years, rumors of missing Nascent Soul cultivators have been rampant.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators appearing, everything proceeding as usual.</p><p>If Nascent Soul cultivators don't appear at this assembly, it's likely the situation will become untenable, and the cultivation world will undergo a drastic upheaval before or after the assembly.</p><p>Qin Sang is a lone wolf, without attachments.</p><p>For him, chaos in the Central Plains might not be a bad thing; troubled waters are good for fishing.</p><p>The prerequisite, however, is sufficient strength. Otherwise, being inadvertently dragged into a major conflict and perishing in the turmoil is a possibility. While he's certainly not weak among cultivators of his level, the great cultivators from top-tier lineages are never short of secret techniques and rare treasures.</p><p>Furthermore, there are Nascent Soul legacies in the Central Plains.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Jiang Mu's gaze, dismissed these thoughts, and asked, "Why did you mention the Ullambana Assembly, Daoist Friend Jiang? If I have the time, I will certainly go to Jinyu State to observe... Could there be treasures at the Ullambana Assembly that surpass the value of the *Turtle Drawing Technique* and the Undetermined Flower?"</p><p>Jiang Mu nodded and shook his head. "There are auctions every day during the assembly, with some highly valued treasures, but treasures surpassing the *Turtle Drawing Technique* should be rare. Even if such treasures exist, they would be unlikely to appear publicly.  Because during the assembly, cultivators from the top sects will hold smaller, private treasure exchange events, excluding outsiders; one needs an introduction to join."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt regret; he could have asked Lu Zhang for an introduction.</p><p>He had focused all his energy on cultivation, thinking that maintaining a good relationship with Bu Nian Mountain was enough, never expecting Bu Nian Mountain to close its doors at this time.</p><p>The Xie family's reputation is unlikely to be of much use at the assembly.</p><p>With the unstable situation in the cultivation world, Qin Sang is no fool; he doesn't want to publicly reveal his identity and cultivation level, drawing attention to himself.</p><p>A true gentleman conceals his abilities and waits for the right moment.</p><p>"Your hall must also be preparing, right?" Qin Sang looked at Jiang Mu.</p><p>"For such a grand event, our Six States Hall certainly won't miss it.  If Daoist Friend Qin is interested, approach me near the time of the assembly in Jinyu State. I'll report to the main hall and secure a position for you.  Rest assured, our hall guarantees that there will be no problems at the treasure exchange."</p><p>Jiang Mu readily admitted it; the more high-level cultivators participating in the treasure exchange, the better.</p><p>Securing a Nascent Soul cultivator with a few words counts as his achievement.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed, but this doesn't solve his immediate problem. The Central Plains will be in chaos after the assembly; should he go back and continue his seclusion?</p><p>Jiang Mu perceived Qin Sang's concerns and changed his tone.  "Don't worry, Daoist Friend. In the coming period, there should be frequent auctions and treasure exchange events."</p><p>“Oh? What do you mean?”</p><p>“The results of the Ullambana Festival have a significant impact on the final distribution of benefits. Before the ceremony, all factions are vying for the best position and making thorough preparations. To compensate for their shortcomings, they are willing to trade treasures they have hoarded for years.  Exchanges between factions alone are insufficient, and many cultivators don't want to reveal their weaknesses for fear of being discovered by their rivals. They will then have to seek purchases through other channels.  Considering the five hundred years of accumulation by these sects, it's a golden opportunity for us independent cultivators to acquire treasures!”</p><p>Jiang Mu rubbed his hands together excitedly.</p><p>Qin Sang's demeanor resembled that of an independent cultivator or an outsider, or perhaps a disguised sect member, but Jiang Mu didn't mind. As he said, more such individuals would appear as the ceremony approached.</p><p>Qin Sang was also greatly interested upon hearing this.</p><p>Liu Zhou Hall, as one of the largest trading houses in Central State, certainly wouldn't lack such commissions!</p><p>Jiang Mu had taken a long roundabout way; his true purpose was this.</p><p>"What are the requirements to participate in such a treasure exchange?" Qin Sang asked directly.</p><p>"Direct and to the point!"</p><p>Jiang Mu stared at Qin Sang. "For ordinary treasure exchanges, Yuan Ying stage cultivators can participate, the more the merrier. However, some prestigious events have strict requirements.  For cultivation alone, at least Yuan Ying mid-stage, or comparable strength! Of course, such treasure exchanges will certainly not disappoint, with rare treasures appearing!"</p><p>Having been at Liu Zhou Hall for some time, Jiang Mu couldn't sense Qin Sang's cultivation level, and he had his suspicions.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand, placed it on the table, tapped his fingers lightly a few times, and suddenly shot a thin strand of sword energy from his index finger, piercing the wall in a flash.</p><p>The sword energy pierced the wall, leaving a small hole before dissipating instantly, incredibly subtle.</p><p>Jiang Mu's pupils constricted. He pressed his palm slightly, preventing the formation from counterattacking. Although the restrictions in the private room were not as strong as the protective arrays outside, the fact that the other party could easily break through spoke volumes.</p><p>Without hesitation, he immediately took out a token and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Qin Daoist, keep this token. When attending the treasure exchange, you can use this token to bring two companions with you without restriction.  When we have news, how should I contact you? Our hall has several communication methods; you can choose any one."</p><p>Qin Sang took the token and found it similar to the Liu Zhou token he had previously received, only with more intricate patterns and extremely complex markings inside, making it very difficult to forge.</p><p>He put away the token and asked, "This is not urgent. Does your hall rent out caves in Yan Shui Market? Qin wishes to rent a cave here for a few days."</p><p>Jiang Mu was startled. "This… I'm afraid it might not meet Daoist's expectations."</p><p>The caves in Yan Shui Market were quite good, but how could they compare to the blessed lands of a Yuan Ying cultivator?</p><p>"It's fine, a superior cave will suffice."</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently.</p><p>Refining the demonic fire did not require high-grade spiritual energy.</p><p>In his future plans, he would inevitably make enemies, especially when searching for the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect. If he were to offend the Eight Views Sect and Gan Lu Chan Yuan, he would need a backup plan.</p><p>Few people knew of the relationship between him and his avatar.</p><p>Taking preemptive measures and acting separately would be helpful.</p><p>Jiang Mu hadn't expected Qin Sang to make such a request, but he couldn't refuse.  He not only personally arranged matters, providing the best cave, but also assigned maidservants for Qin Sang's use.</p><p>The cave was located on a fairy mountain in the northern part of Yan Shui Market.</p><p>Qin Sang occupied a peak and a lake, with beautiful scenery, a truly tranquil paradise amidst the bustle.</p><p>After settling Qin Sang, Jiang Mu took his leave, with Qin Sang personally seeing him off.</p><p>Several maidservants lived in a small building by the lake, awaiting orders.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored them and returned to his cave alone.</p><p>He had instructed Jiang Mu not to disturb him unless it was for the highest-level treasure exchange, allowing him to focus on seclusion.  After surveying his cave, Qin Sang removed the original restrictions, personally set up a large array, and sat cross-legged.</p><p>The demonic banner floated before him.</p><p>The fire lotus between his brows flickered.</p><p>The petals of the fire lotus had opened a little more.</p><p>Strand by strand, the demonic fire was refined silently, transferring from one demonic banner to another.</p><p>Time quietly slipped away in the dark cave.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, the maidservants in the lakeside building changed shift after shift. They were arguably the most relaxed maidservants in Liu Zhou Hall. From their arrival to their departure, they hadn't even seen the face of the person they were serving, arousing the envy of everyone.</p><p>Each shift change caused competition.</p><p>Everyone was curious about who lived on that mountain, as it was Jiang Mu, the chief steward himself, who had given orders that no one was to disturb them.</p><p>Twenty-odd years passed like this.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in the cave, paying no attention to the changes in the outside world.</p><p>Inside the cave...</p><p>Black flames flickered in the void, initially wild and untamed, gradually becoming docile, transforming into a stream of liquid-like black fire flowing into Qin Sang's forehead, merging with the fire lotus within.</p><p>This scene had repeated countless times in the cave.</p><p>“It’s getting slower…”</p><p>A soft sigh echoed in the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke, the fire lotus in his forehead disappearing. He waved his sleeve, putting away the magic banner.  He sensed the overwhelming pressure of Heaven's Way; the tribulation was imminent!</p><p>Bold as he was, while others trembled before such an ordeal, Qin Sang, on the verge of tribulation, was still cultivating a secret technique, without much preparation.</p><p>“Time to prepare for the tribulation,”</p><p>Qin Sang thought, taking a few breaths to regain his composure, before leaving the cave.</p><p>The dazzling sunlight warmed him as he stood before the entrance. He paused, noticing for the first time in over twenty years, the beautiful scenery of Yan Shui Xu.  Cultivation was timeless, inevitably causing one to miss many sights.</p><p>Maidens played by the lake, their carefree joy a lovely sight.</p><p>Qin Sang did not disturb them, quietly flying out of Yan Shui Xu.  Passing Mount Pu, his physical form sensed his avatar, who emerged to join him and act as a protector during the tribulation.</p><p>The second Nascent Soul merged back into his main body to be nurtured.</p><p>Qin Sang learned of his avatar's progress.  Assisted by the Ice Disc, his mastery of the "Ice Soul Divine Light" had advanced rapidly; he saw no sign of a bottleneck, and it seemed highly likely he could perfect this technique.  However, as his cultivation progressed, the Ice Soul Divine Light increasingly diverged from its original form. He wondered what it would eventually become.</p><p>Qin Sang had already chosen a location for his tribulation: an uninhabited wasteland between Zhuozhou and Zhaoyaozhou.</p><p>He flew over countless mountains.</p><p>Before him stretched a vast plain.</p><p>Flying for a while longer, he landed in the center of the wasteland, sending his avatar to scout for any uninvited guests.</p><p>His main body then began to work.</p><p>He prepared a spirit array for the tribulation, the Xuanjing Hanlie Array, a fusion of the Xuanjing Array of the Yuan Shen Gate and the Han Yin Liefeng Array from the Tingxue Tower, combining their strengths.  The setup was exceedingly complex.</p><p>Once the array was complete,</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged in the center, entering a meditative state, with his avatar standing guard nearby.</p><p>Half a month passed.</p><p>Though the tribulation hadn't arrived, the pressure of Heaven's Way was palpable.</p><p>The creatures of the wasteland, sensing the impending danger, fled without Qin Sang needing to drive them away.</p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>Both the main body and avatar looked up at the sky.</p><p>From a clear sky, a muffled thunderclap echoed.  The moment the thunder sounded, the sunlight dimmed, and then the wind arose, clouds gathering.</p><p>Clouds formed in all directions.</p><p>In an instant, dark clouds surged in the void, gathering frantically above Qin Sang.  The light faded, a fierce wind swept the wasteland, withered grass flew everywhere, the world plunged into chaos.</p><p>His avatar’s clothes billowed in the wind; he stood alert, scanning his surroundings, before disappearing in a flash.</p><p>His main body remained motionless, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly perched on his shoulder, its wings fluttering calmly.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Jincheng Sword transformed into a sword light, circling Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Sky-Eyed Butterfly; he was confident in overcoming this tribulation, and had a more important task: helping the butterfly absorb more tribulation thunder.</p><p>‘Rumble…boom…’</p><p>The tribulation cloud formed rapidly, leaving no time for respite, and the tribulation thunder descended!</p><p>Lightning fell like a waterfall.</p><p>The wasteland went from dark to bright, then bright as day again.</p><p>With a ringing sword cry, the Jincheng Sword soared against the onslaught.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly followed closely, its wings fluttering.</p><p>During his Nascent Soul tribulation, Qin Sang only dared let it absorb stray strands of lightning. Now, confident in handling any unforeseen events, he allowed the butterfly to confront the tribulation thunder directly.</p><p>Thunder roared; the Jincheng Sword was swallowed by the lightning.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Countless sword lights scattered, forming a dazzling disc in the air to block the tribulation thunder!</p><p>Amidst the thunderous roar, sword light and tribulation thunder annihilated each other, but some thunder was deliberately allowed to pass through, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly darting forward, its wings emitting seemingly slender bolts of lightning, forming a thicker, stronger lightning net than when it broke through to its fourth transformation.</p><p>The scene of absorbing tribulation thunder repeated itself.</p><p>Qin Sang, still awestruck, felt even greater expectations for the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Then, he sensed the butterfly's pain—directly consuming tribulation thunder was harder than absorbing stray strands—but its playful nature persisted, indicating its resilience.</p><p>Qin Sang comforted the butterfly while wielding his sword to defend against the tribulation thunder.</p>
