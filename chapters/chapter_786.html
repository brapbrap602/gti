<h1>Chapter 778: Within the Celestial Tower</h1><p>Qin Sang glanced towards the Celestial Tower; the Wu clan Yuan Ying cultivator was still there.</p><p>The man surnamed Di explained, “With your cultivation, Daoist Friend, you certainly have the strength to enter the Celestial Tower alone. But as you’ve seen, we don’t know when this senior will let us pass, and it seems we won’t have much time. The Celestial Tower is fraught with peril; we are all independent cultivators, and fighting alone might not be enough. So, Su Daoist Friend and I discussed inviting a few fellow independent cultivators to enter the Celestial Tower with us, to break through quickly. What do you think, Daoist Friend Qin?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression shifted slightly upon hearing this.</p><p>He hadn’t planned on gathering helpers; firstly, he couldn’t find suitable ones, and secondly, he was confident enough in his own abilities to navigate the Celestial Tower.</p><p>No one could have predicted this unexpected turn of events.</p><p>Teaming up with other independent cultivators wasn’t a bad option.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the cultivators in the square were also gathering in small groups, clearly with the same idea as the man surnamed Di.</p><p>“I appreciate your consideration, but I have a question. There are so many strong cultivators in front of the Celestial Tower; I’m hardly at the top of the list. Why did you two choose me?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t immediately agree, asking curiously.</p><p>The old woman smiled and spoke frankly, “Because I saw Daoist Friend Qin come here alone, so I could confirm that you, like us, are an independent cultivator. Others, although more powerful, have unclear backgrounds; some are mysterious, with ulterior motives, and we don’t want to be targeted. Besides, we are only teaming up to hasten our progress and will part ways once we reach our destination. As long as you can handle the dangers along the way, it’s enough. If we wish to look for treasure together, we can discuss it later. That’s why when Daoist Friend Di approached me, I recommended you.”</p><p>The man surnamed Di nodded. “If Daoist Friend Qin is worried, you can ask them yourself. We are all here alone; we just arrived a little earlier than you.”</p><p>Saying this, the man surnamed Di pointed towards the square. A man and a woman were standing at the edge, looking over.</p><p>The man surnamed Di’s face lit up. “It seems Daoist Friend Wu has persuaded that female cultivator. If Daoist Friend Qin agrees, the five of us will be enough; we don’t need to find anyone else.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked over and saw that the man was also a Wu cultivator, while the woman was human.</p><p>This would make the team three humans and two Wu cultivators—rather unusual. Fortunately, they were only temporarily cooperating, without competing interests.</p><p>Qin Sang actually remembered all of them.</p><p>When he first arrived, they were all standing alone on the outskirts.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t hesitate any longer and accepted their invitation.</p><p>They didn't know when they would be able to enter the Celestial Tower, so the five of them only briefly discussed their plan. Qin Sang learned that the female cultivator's surname was Yin and that she also identified herself as an independent cultivator, without further details being shared.</p><p>After making their plans, Qin Sang returned to the forest and continued refining the Golden Yao Lock.</p><p>Then came the tedious wait.  Some people, unable to bear it, abandoned the Celestial Tower and went elsewhere to search for treasures.  The Seven Killing Hall opened only once every few decades, and they spent a lot of spirit stones to buy entry; continuing to wait could mean losing everything.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on refining his magic weapon. Not long after, he suddenly heard the man surnamed Di shout excitedly, “Daoist Friend Qin, come quickly! We can go in!”</p><p>Qin Sang's face brightened. He hurriedly put away the Golden Yao Locks, and his figure flickered as he dashed out of the forest. He saw that the old man in front of the Celestial Tower was gone, and streaks of light rushed towards the gate.</p><p>The Golden Yao Lock was almost finished refining, barely usable.</p><p>“Where's the senior?”</p><p>Qin Sang met up with the others and asked curiously.</p><p>The old woman whispered, “That senior seemed to receive some signal and went into the Celestial Tower.”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. “So, the Demon Lord and the Great Wu Priest haven’t come out yet?”</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>The man surnamed Di nodded, his tone heavy. “Everyone be careful. If the Yuan Ying battle hasn’t ended, don’t get caught in the crossfire.”</p><p>Everyone’s expressions were grave, but at this point, giving up was impossible. They didn’t slow down, rushing one after another into the Celestial Tower’s entrance.</p><p>As cultivator after cultivator entered, the space at the entrance of the Celestial Tower rippled like water.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed to the Celestial Tower entrance, glanced at it, and charged in without hesitation.  He was immediately met with a dizzying sensation, enveloped by darkness.</p><p>Despite having gathered information and prepared mentally, the sight before them still caused a shock, leaving them speechless.</p><p>He found himself in an unknown space, shrouded in endless darkness. It seemed as if sunlight had never touched this place; the boundless darkness chilled them to the bone.</p><p>In the depths of the darkness, some green lights floated, like stars.</p><p>These green lights varied in size and shape.</p><p>Some were long and narrow, stretching for several miles.</p><p>Many were only as large as a stone, shining like a galaxy.</p><p>Others were huge luminous orbs, hundreds of meters in diameter.</p><p>Looking closely, they realized the green lights were emanating from fragments of buildings made of various green bricks.</p><p>Within the narrow beams of green light was a long corridor, stretching endlessly in both directions, its destination unknown.</p><p>And within the larger luminous orbs, there was an entire ancient palace, radiating a mysterious, ethereal glow.</p><p>These structures were incredibly damaged; the smaller orbs of light were fragments of walls and broken tiles from buildings completely shattered.</p><p>All the structures were deathly silent, floating silently in the darkness, devoid of any life or vitality, exuding an apocalyptic desolation.</p><p>In their prime, these must have been magnificent ancient palaces.  Now, only fragments remained before them, like scattered pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.</p><p>The space within the Sky Tower had been shattered, yet somehow, without causing the dreaded spatial rifts or storms.</p><p>Space remained stable, but the ancient palace was no more.  </p><p>The ancient cultivators had vanished without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang's feet were on a piece of a ruined wall. He plunged down, his figure falling, urging his spiritual sword to strike the wall forcefully.</p><p>A clang of metal resonated, the green light from the wall flashed brightly, the ebony sword was easily deflected and flew back, leaving the wall completely unmarked.</p><p>Even the restrictions on these ruined walls were impenetrable to them.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, you're here."</p><p>At that moment, the voice of the Yin family cultivator behind Qin Sang called out.  Turning around and flying over, she looked around.  "The other three aren't nearby.  It seems the vortex at the entrance scattered us. Let's send out the signal."</p><p>The cultivator nodded, and together with Qin Sang, they sent out the agreed-upon signal.</p><p>The remaining three joined them, arriving one after another.</p><p>"I've heard tales of the Sky Tower, but Di was nearly overwhelmed by the sight," a man surnamed Di exclaimed. "What a terrible battle it must have been to destroy this place to such an extent!"</p><p>His words resonated with the others, who echoed his sentiments.</p><p>An old woman urged them, "Time is short. Let's hurry to the teleportation hall."</p>
