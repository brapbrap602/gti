<h1>Chapter 387:  A Glimpse of the Dao, Then Death Would Be Sweet</h1><p>Chapter 387:  A Glimpse of the Dao, Then Death Would Be Sweet</p><p>The scene replayed: the relentless pursuit, the desperate evasion.</p><p>Two breaths later.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ebony sword, just flung from Qin Sang's brow, met the Night Fork's fist mid-flight.  The sword array shattered as the sword was sent reeling back, slamming into Qin Sang.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang's chest seized with pain. A wave of nausea washed over him as his upper body folded like a shrimp, crashing against the wall.</p><p>Fortunately, the ebony sword, a magical artifact, was durable enough to withstand the blow.  It shielded Qin Sang, saving him from certain death.</p><p>Qin Sang, battered and bruised, lay on the ground. He tried to rise, but darkness fell upon him as the Night Fork reappeared, swift and silent.</p><p>Qin Sang's consciousness finally recovered enough to influence the Corpse Talisman again. With a roar, he focused all his energy on controlling the talisman on the Night Fork.</p><p>The Night Fork faltered slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity. In a strange, half-reclining position, he slid out of the ice palace with incredible speed.</p><p>Fifteen breaths!</p><p>As if crossing a threshold, the suffocating pressure vanished. The Night Fork was gone.</p><p>Free from the煞尸's domain, Qin Sang felt an overwhelming sense of relief. The tension that had gripped him for so long finally released.</p><p>"Whew… whew…"</p><p>Qin Sang gasped for breath, his abdomen throbbing.</p><p>He gritted his teeth, clutching his dantian, and sat up halfway.</p><p>From entering the ice palace to this moment, only fifteen breaths had passed. To keep the Night Fork occupied and prevent it from attacking Yun Youzi, he had pushed himself to the limit, twice depleting his energy reserves.  The second time, he'd brutally refined a pill, then exhausted himself again, causing considerable damage to his dantian.</p><p>Qin Sang kept track of the time.</p><p>Mission accomplished!  Fifteen breaths, precisely as planned!</p><p>The Night Fork was gone. Qin Sang watched Yun Youzi's direction – no battle there.  Yun Youzi had succeeded. Relief washed over him.</p><p>He trusted Yun Youzi's judgment. Fifteen breaths would be more than enough time.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang turned to another chamber.</p><p>He'd fulfilled Yun Youzi's request.  Now, it was time for his own mission.</p><p>Through his soul mark, Qin Sang sensed the living corpse entering the chamber, speeding through a narrow passage. Thankfully, the passage was short; it remained within Qin Sang's perception until he saw the end.</p><p>Suddenly, the living corpse froze.</p><p>The Night Fork, previously battling Qin Sang in the ice hall, now sat silently in the dark chamber.  It had returned to its lair faster than the racing corpse, its escape technique impossibly swift.</p><p>Qin Sang, recalling the strange scene, steeled his resolve. He controlled the living corpse, slowly advancing towards the chamber.</p><p>The Night Fork heard the sound and turned its head.</p><p>*Click… click…*</p><p>The Night Fork's gaze was fixed, its dark pupils devoid of emotion, icy cold.</p><p>Qin Sang was incredibly tense, controlling the living corpse's slow movements.</p><p>One step, two steps…</p><p>The living corpse drew closer. The Night Fork watched, motionless, eventually closing its eyes.</p><p>He'd gambled right!</p><p>Qin Sang was elated.  He didn't know the reason for the Night Fork's change, but it was the best possible outcome.</p><p>Fearing that the opportunity might vanish, Qin Sang guided the living corpse to the chamber entrance, then quickly scanned for any possible remains or artifacts.</p><p>The chamber wasn't large, but it was chaotically disordered.  Shattered ice littered the floor. Countless scratch marks scarred the walls—evidence of a fierce battle, or perhaps the Night Fork's destructive frenzy.</p><p>The ice shards had fused together, indicating the passage of considerable time.</p><p>After searching the chamber's entrance, Qin Sang was disappointed.  Nothing but ice.</p><p>Unwilling to give up, he hesitated, then ordered the living corpse to enter.</p><p>The Night Fork sat motionless on the largest ice shard in the center of the chamber.</p><p>The living corpse pressed its back against the ice wall, wary of angering the Night Fork.  It carefully moved along the edge, from right to left, meticulously examining each corner.</p><p>Nothing on the right.</p><p>Nothing in the furthest corner.</p><p>On the left…</p><p>Suddenly, the living corpse stopped.  Its gaze fixated on a corner of the wall, a section of ice.</p><p>Surrounded by chaotic scratch marks, this inconspicuous corner held dense, meticulously carved writing!</p><p>The living corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang, upon seeing the inscriptions, felt a surge of excitement.  He sensed this might be the only valuable thing here and carefully examined the writing.</p><p>Qin Sang, his true form seated outside the ice palace, had just taken some healing pills to mend his wounds.  His expression grew increasingly strange, then shifted to shock and awe, as if the ice wall recorded something incredible.</p><p>In the side chamber.</p><p>After reading the inscription on the ice wall, the living corpse slowly turned, his gaze complex as he looked at the Flying Night Rakshasa seated on the ice.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang finally understood.</p><p>No wonder there were no corpses of Tian Shi Sect cultivators here.</p><p>Because this Flying Night Rakshasa was not a corpse puppet of a Tian Shi Sect cultivator – it was the cultivator himself!</p><p>His name was Wu Shang, a disciple of the Tian Shi Sect.  He was at the False Core stage in his lifetime.</p><p>The inscription on the ice wall was a record left by Wu Shang. His name appeared at the end.  He seemed to have faced an urgent crisis, his writing becoming increasingly messy. Qin Sang managed to decipher the final inscription with difficulty.</p><p>The content was divided into two parts.</p><p>The first part included the method of restraining cultivators and creating living corpses, the same information Qin Sang obtained from the Tian Shi Order.  It also contained a secret technique to enhance a living corpse to a Flying Night Rakshasa—a technique Qin Sang desperately wanted.</p><p>Creating a Flying Night Rakshasa was difficult; the technique was exceptionally complex.  Most of the requirements weren't overly demanding and could be gathered with patience. However, two necessities presented insurmountable difficulties for Qin Sang.</p><p>Firstly, a living corpse created from a False Core cultivator.</p><p>Secondly, a Golden Core or Demonic Core!</p><p>Only with these two could a living corpse be possibly upgraded to a Flying Night Rakshasa, creating a Golden Core-level corpse puppet.</p><p>However, what shocked Qin Sang most was not the secret technique, but the second part of the inscription.</p><p>The second part mainly consisted of Wu Shang's account, detailing the process of transforming himself into a living corpse and then upgrading it to a Flying Night Rakshasa.  After trying countless methods in his lifetime and failing to reach the Golden Core stage,</p><p>Wu Shang was unwilling to accept that his immortal cultivation would stop there. Recalling the Tian Shi Sect's secret technique, he had a sudden idea.</p><p>If a living corpse could evolve into a Flying Night Rakshasa, could he, by transforming himself into a living corpse, also…</p><p>Upon conceiving the idea, he acted.</p><p>After extensive research and thorough preparation, he implanted the Tian Shi talisman into his soul, transforming himself into a living corpse.</p><p>Then, he incorporated a Demonic Core into his body…</p><p>A sentence from the inscription stood out:  "To hear the Dao in the morning, even death in the evening would be worthwhile!"</p>
