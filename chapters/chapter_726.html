Chapter 718: The Road Ahead


“Fifteen years have passed since I arrived here. It's about time to return.”


A soft sigh echoed from within the cave.


Qin Sang glanced around. The cave furnishings were simple but not crude. What was truly remarkable was the abundance of spiritual energy, no less than that found in the finest caves.


Finding such an excellent cave in the vast Demonic Sea was a stroke of great luck.


Over the years, he had been very content with his life in the Demonic Sea, completely losing track of time.


Thanks to the Hun Yuan Concentric Rings' early warning system, Qin Sang had rarely encountered real danger. The丹药 and other supplies he had prepared before his departure still remained plentiful.


Given his temperament, he wouldn't have minded staying until his supplies ran out. Unfortunately, he only had two Six-Petal Butterfly Violets left, barely enough to sustain the Sky-Eyed Butterfly for much longer.


The Six-Petal Butterfly Violets on Red Leaf Island should be ripe by now, but Qin Sang was completely unaware of the outside world. He didn't know how the conflict between the two races had progressed, and whether he could safely reach Red Leaf Island was still uncertain.


Over the years, as Qin Sang's cultivation had steadily improved, his two spirit insects had also grown at an astonishing rate.


Not long after settling in this cave, the Fat Silkworm had completely absorbed the poison pills and, as expected, smoothly transitioned to the middle stage of its second transformation.


What surprised Qin Sang was that after reaching the middle stage, its rate of absorbing poison pills became increasingly faster, yet the effects of the pills were not as pronounced as before.


After absorbing all the poison pills Qin Sang had prepared, it was on the verge of breaking through to the late stage, but the effectiveness of the pills continued to diminish.


Seeing this, Qin Sang took out the true demon cores of poisonous beasts. After some initial struggles, the Fat Silkworm was actually able to directly absorb the demon cores, which gave Qin Sang a sigh of relief. Otherwise, he really wouldn't have known what to feed it.


The Fat Silkworm's abilities had been proven in several battles against poisonous beasts.


The seven-colored halo, transformed into a poison-repelling armor, could now withstand the intense venom of early-stage demon core poisonous beasts.


The armor was as thin as a cicada's wing, and when Qin Sang wore it, it was hardly noticeable to others. In future battles against cultivators specializing in poison, this would give him a significant advantage.


The Fat Silkworm, clutching a poisonous beast's demon core, was sound asleep in its insect basket, having successfully broken through to the late stage of its second transformation.


In contrast, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly hadn't grown as quickly. Although it had also broken through to the middle stage three years ago, its third transformation would likely occur later than the Fat Silkworm's.


‘Ring… Ring…’


The Hun Yuan Concentric Rings flew up, emitting a white light. The Two-Headed Flood Dragon emerged, still covered in wounds.


Its injuries had improved somewhat, and the wounds were beginning to heal.


Upon being released, the Two-Headed Flood Dragon struggled to stand up. Its entire body bristled, its eyes fierce, teeth bared, and it let out a low growl at Qin Sang.


Qin Sang's face darkened. The Hun Yuan Concentric Rings tightened, and the Two-Headed Flood Dragon was pulled back down. It screamed in pain, tumbling to the ground, its body trembling. Sometimes, it would curl up into a ball, oblivious to its wounds reopening.


At the peak of its agony, it even slammed its head against the cave walls.


Qin Sang watched coldly, his expression unchanged.


Finally, when the Two-Headed Flood Dragon lay exhausted, barely breathing, Qin Sang paused the punishment.


“I know your intelligence surpasses that of those savage sea beasts. You should understand what I mean.”


Qin Sang walked over, picked up the Two-Headed Flood Dragon by the neck, and looked directly into its vertical pupils.


Facing such an unruly beast, Qin Sang also had a headache.


Similar scenarios had occurred several times along the way, but none could subdue the Two-Headed Flood Dragon. The previous Azure Shark had submitted to Qin Sang after only the second time.


The Two-Headed Flood Dragon didn't have a shred of strength left, but it still stubbornly glared at Qin Sang. Yet, deep within its eyes, there was a profound weariness that Qin Sang keenly noticed.


“It's impossible for me to either release or kill you. Whether you're willing or not, the Hun Yuan Concentric Rings will eventually make you submit. You might as well accept your fate. Countless beasts have been taken as mounts by cultivators. You're not the only one. You’ve seen the fate of the Azure Shark. I won’t bind you forever. When I find a better beast, or when you're no longer useful to me, I will give you back your freedom… provided you obey my commands!”


The Two-Headed Flood Dragon remained silent, its eyes flickering.


Qin Sang fed it another spirit pill and then retracted the Yang Ring.


Two months later.


Qin Sang appeared on the sea surface, holding a nautical chart. After determining his direction, he decided to head north, returning via the route he had come.


The southern route was likely still occupied by the evil cultivators. They were powerful and unpredictable, so after careful consideration, Qin Sang decided to take the northern route.


He was also curious if the Cold Flame was still in its original location, or if it had already been taken by a transformed demon.


After discovering that a transformed demon had been attracted by the Cold Flame and had appeared in this sea region, Qin Sang had been very anxious and cautious for a while. Later, after noticing no further disturbances in the Demonic Sea, he finally felt relieved.


During this period, there had been only one brief commotion among the sea beasts, two years ago. At that time, Qin Sang was already deep within the Demonic Sea, and by the time he noticed the anomaly, it was already ending.


Qin Sang ventured north to investigate and suspected that it was caused by the transformed demon passing through again. However, this time was different. After an interval of over a decade, the transformed demon had finally returned.


No one knew what the transformed demon had been doing lurking near Huntian Island for over a decade.


Qin Sang suspected that since the transformed demon was willing to return, it had likely succeeded in its objective.


Having spent fifteen years here, Qin Sang was very familiar with this sea region. He easily found the optimal route and, with a wave of his arm, released the Two-Headed Flood Dragon.


The Two-Headed Flood Dragon lay on the water's surface.


A cyan light flickered from its ribs, forming a pair of exceptionally graceful wind wings. Judging by its aura, its injuries had clearly healed.


Qin Sang sat astride the Two-Headed Flood Dragon, pointed in the direction he wanted to go, then closed his eyes and began to cultivate. The Two-Headed Flood Dragon reluctantly stood up, flapped its wings, and soared through the air.


Half a month later, Qin Sang saw the large island marking the exit of the Thousand Demons Sea Region.


The western sea surface of the island appeared normal, but Qin Sang decided to err on the side of caution. He recalled the Two-Headed Flood Dragon and proceeded alone.


Alone, it would be easier to conceal himself and escape if he encountered danger.


He entered the Thousand Demons Sea Region and retraced his steps. He didn't encounter any large groups of sea beasts along the way, and Qin Sang's tense nerves gradually relaxed as he smoothly arrived near Cold Flame Island.


A shadowy figure appeared on the empty sea surface. Qin Sang turned towards the north, the direction of the Cold Flame.


After a moment of hesitation, Qin Sang performed the Escaping Spirit Technique. With a flip of his palm, a scroll appeared, the very magical treasure he had seized from the young man of the Wu Clan, possessing illusory powers.


With a light flick, the scroll flew above Qin Sang's head and slowly unrolled, revealing an exquisitely detailed painting of a mountain forest, with a vast sea of trees and a profusion of flowers, a scene of breathtaking beauty.


Falling flowers and leaves drifted down from the painting, swirling around him, then silently vanished without a trace.
