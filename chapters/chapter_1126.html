<h1>Chapter 1118: Three Years</h1><p>The two discussed Dao, gaining new insights into cultivation.  To avoid disturbing Yunyouzi's tribulation, Qin Sang stayed a few days before taking leave and returning to Taohua Valley.</p><p>Three years passed in this way.  During those three years, Yunyouzi mostly remained in seclusion, and Qin Sang rarely disturbed him.</p><p>Qin Sang asked Yunyouzi about the Demon Realm, and he proved to be quite knowledgeable about it. He even knew a little about the Demon King who stole the mysterious stone tablet, recounting several rumors.  However, Qin Sang had no intention of seeking out the Demon King now.  Stealing a treasure from a Demon King was far too risky; he wouldn't even consider it unless absolutely necessary, especially now, at the critical juncture of Yunyouzi's tribulation.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang was in meditative cultivation.  After continuously absorbing the power of the celestial stars, he had recently reached the peak of the third level of *Tianyao Lianxing*, only to encounter another bottleneck. This hurdle was even more difficult than the previous ones. He tried using the Star Platform for stellar essence infusion, but the stellar essence was too weak to help him break through again.</p><p>Currently, the most suitable place in the cultivation world for stellar essence infusion was Zhitian Peak.  To go to Zhitian Peak, however, he needed Qingjun's help, but she hadn't returned for many years, and Qin Sang couldn't find her, so he had to wait patiently.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang devoted himself to cultivating the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang*, making rapid progress.</p><p>A streak of light flew into Taohua Valley.  Qin Sang was startled awake from his meditation, caught the light, and his expression changed.</p><p>"The tribulation is coming soon?"</p><p>The light seemed to be a message from Yunyouzi. He had made all the necessary preparations and the tribulation would be in a month's time.  He requested Qin Sang's protection!</p><p>It was sooner than expected. Qin Sang hadn't anticipated it being so soon. He stood up, hastily left his cave dwelling, paused, and looked towards Bai's cave dwelling. He had been wanting to introduce Yunyouzi to Bai.</p><p>But Bai had been in seclusion since his last retreat and hadn't emerged since, remaining constantly in his cave dwelling, focusing on comprehending the Corpse Soul Orb. Qin Sang didn't know how far Bai had progressed in his understanding of the orb, so he hesitated to disturb him.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang activated the cave's restriction and sent a message inside.</p><p>Although Qin Sang believed that Yunyouzi was well-prepared and that his protection would likely be sufficient, he wanted to be safe.  Having Bai there would provide additional support.</p><p>A moment later,</p><p>"Someone is undergoing a Nascent Soul tribulation? Observing it wouldn't be bad."</p><p>Bai's voice came from the cave dwelling, clearly tinged with weariness.  The cave dwelling opened, and Bai came out.  After such a long seclusion, Bai's aura seemed unchanged from twenty years ago.</p><p>"Congratulations, Daoist friend, on your significant progress!"</p><p>Bai's eyes were sharp, and he saw that Qin Sang was no longer the same.  He exclaimed, "Back then, we were roughly equals, but now, even without using that thunder technique, you can still easily surpass me."</p><p>Despite Bai's praise, Qin Sang remained humble, shaking his head and saying, "Before Nascent Soul, we are all but ants."</p><p>What did being the number one Golden Core cultivator matter? Qin Sang's goal had always been to become a Nascent Soul master.</p><p>Bai nodded, said nothing more, and after learning about Yunyouzi's background from Qin Sang, retreated into his corpse puppet bag.</p><p>Half an hour later, Qin Sang arrived at the place he and Yunyouzi had agreed upon.  It was on a deserted island at the edge of the Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>Seeing Yunyouzi and Li Yu Fu standing on the mountaintop in the distance, Qin Sang accelerated, his escaping light flashing repeatedly as he landed before them.</p><p>"Master Uncle!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu paid his respects. Qin Sang noticed that Li Yu Fu's expression was unusually serious, his eyes filled with worry, undoubtedly for his Grandmaster.</p><p>The Nascent Soul tribulation was the first major hurdle on the path of cultivation; one's success often came at the cost of countless failures.</p><p>Yunyouzi himself, however, was carefree and composed, his clothes fluttering in the wind, showing no signs of nervousness.</p><p>"Little brother, these are some pills I recently refined to assist in the tribulation. I collected extra medicinal herbs, so I made two sets; here’s one for you."</p><p>Yunyouzi said loudly, tossing three jade bottles.</p><p>Qin Sang caught them, discovering that the bottles contained pills of various colors. Some restored true essence, others healed soul and body injuries—all prepared for the tribulation.  While not Soul-Washing Liquid, which increased the chances of successful Nascent Soul formation, taking them during the tribulation would still be of considerable help.</p><p>Qin Sang had intended to buy some from a trading house, but Yunyouzi had prepared them for him.  Made by Yunyouzi's hand, they were all top-quality pills of superior efficacy.</p><p>"Thank you, senior!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stand on ceremony and put them all away.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's understanding of Yunyouzi, he wasn't as relaxed as he appeared.</p><p>Who would dare underestimate the Heavenly Tribulation?</p><p>Yun Youzi's demeanor was subtly different.  Three years of quiet cultivation weren't just for alchemy; he'd also thoroughly reflected on his entire life, achieving a greater clarity of purpose. To Qin Sang, he seemed faintly detached.</p><p>"The tribulation will take place in the western part of Yun Cang Marsh – a very remote area…"</p><p>Yun Youzi flew towards the heart of the Yun Cang Marsh with the two of them, explaining as they traveled, "The Zu Yuan's invasion has occupied most of the Tian Xing Alliance's territory, forcing some sects to relocate north.  Xiao Han Domain ceded part of Yun Cang Marsh to them. Now, the Marsh is far busier than before; otherwise, we wouldn't need such a secluded spot…"</p><p>Forming a Nascent Soul and facing the tribulation involves the infusion of spiritual energy.  While a powerful spiritual vein isn't strictly necessary, it can't be done just anywhere.</p><p>Yun Youzi carefully selected an island in the Yun Cang Marsh. It lacked top-tier spiritual veins, but several hidden ones converged there.  He'd already set up a large formation on the island in preparation for the tribulation.</p><p>Staying at the Taiyi Dan Sect, protected by the mountain gate's formation and with the Sect Master providing protection, would have been the safest option. Yet Yun Youzi chose the inconvenience and risk of a remote tribulation.</p><p>"I've checked; the surrounding area is very barren, devoid of any Nascent Soul cultivators or powerful transformed demonic beasts. If the tribulation attracts any deep-sea creatures, they might emerge, so you'll need to be ready…"</p><p>The three pressed on into the Yun Cang Marsh.  It's vast, but largely desolate, especially the west, which offers little of value.  They encountered several cultivators along the way, mostly from the Tian Xing Alliance.  The farther west they went, the fewer cultivators they met.  In the final stretch, they saw no one at all.</p><p>"We're here!"</p><p>Yun Youzi stopped at a barren stretch of water. With a wave of his sleeve, the water parted, revealing the outline of the spirit formation.  The small island within the formation was only about ten miles across. A solitary, imposing peak on the island pointed towards the heavens.  This was the place Yun Youzi had chosen for his tribulation!</p><p>Yun Youzi's expression was calm. Without a word, he nodded to Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu, then entered the formation.</p><p>The Nascent Soul tribulation must be faced alone; others cannot assist, nor can they get too close, lest they trigger unforeseen changes in the tribulation and perish along with him.</p><p>Li Yu Fu's face was etched with worry.  Watching Yun Youzi settle into a meditative posture atop the peak as the spirit formation closed, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. "Let's go," she said.</p><p>They flew to a nearby deserted island to await the Heavenly Tribulation.</p>
