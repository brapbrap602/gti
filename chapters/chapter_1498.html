<h1>Chapter 1489: The Deceitful General (4k)</h1><p>The Gluttonous Lake lies between two mountains.</p><p>Its surface is long and narrow.</p><p>The rock walls on either side of the lake bed are clearly visible, uneven and jagged.</p><p>The water is clear, yet bottomless.</p><p>The lake bed is pitch black, like a gaping maw ready to devour everything.</p><p>And that is precisely the case.  The seemingly calm lake bottom not only holds ancient restrictions but also a strange, powerful suction. Anything that falls into its pull, including cultivators, vanishes without a trace.</p><p>No one knows where these people are taken.</p><p>The lake is named “Gluttonous” for this reason.</p><p>In exploring the secrets hidden within the Gluttonous Lake, Xuan Tian Palace lost many experts, with little to show for it. Eventually, it was abandoned.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli arrived at the Floating Mountain and stood by the shores of the Gluttonous Lake.</p><p>Liuli pointed to the lake bed, explaining the characteristics of the restrictions and the suction to Qin Sang.  They quickly formulated a plan and without hesitation, jumped into the lake.</p><p>Invisible restrictions drifted in the water.</p><p>Liuli chose an extremely winding path, yet descended very quickly, showing her intimate knowledge of the place.</p><p>Qin Sang, using his sword for protection, followed closely behind Liuli.  He didn't need to intervene; Liuli expertly alternated between her phoenix-shaped sword and another magic weapon, handling the situation with ease.</p><p>After descending to an unknown depth, Liuli suddenly stopped and transmitted her voice, “This is the place!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked intently. The lake bottom was dark; his eyes could only discern a faint, shimmering barrier of ancient restrictions to his left.</p><p>However, his spiritual sense told him that right next to this barrier was a powerful suction force. It was calm, undisturbed, and had no effect on the water itself, but it gave Qin Sang an extremely dangerous feeling.</p><p>This was the most perilous spot.</p><p>The ancient restrictions were incredibly powerful, but the most problematic was the mysterious suction. Liuli needed Qin Sang’s help to overcome it; she could handle everything else alone.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then summoned his external manifestation, saying, “Let's begin!”</p><p>Liuli glanced at the manifestation and nodded slightly.</p><p>The phoenix-shaped sword unleashed a powerful burst of energy; sword and person became one, and they charged straight at the ancient restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang was not slow to react. The moment Liuli made her move, he immediately activated the Golden Sinking Sword array, using the array's power to counter the suction.</p><p>At the same time, his external manifestation raised both palms, and two blasts of chilling air transformed into ice dragons, charging towards the direction where Liuli had gone.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The phoenix-shaped sword struck the ancient restrictions; a chaotic force erupted underwater, surging outwards in all directions.</p><p>The suction force, adjacent to the restrictions, was immediately disturbed, awakening from its slumber. Like a roused lion, it suddenly unleashed an incredibly powerful aura.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Seven Souls Killing Array descended, and the power of the sword array clashed head-on with the suction.</p><p>Liuli's eyes flashed with a幽蓝之光 , and her Ice Soul divine light spread into the ancient restrictions. In an instant, a layer of blue permeated the barrier, making it look as fragile as ice.</p><p>‘Zhen!’</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword's light shone even brighter.</p><p>The suction force surged violently, and the sword array couldn't completely seal it off.</p><p>At this critical moment, the external manifestation's magic proved effective. The two ice dragons converged behind Liuli, forming an ice mirror to block the suction.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Cracks quickly spread across the ice mirror, which ultimately shattered.  The fragments were immediately sucked away and vanished.</p><p>However, Liuli had successfully broken through the ancient restrictions and entered the other side of the barrier.  Seeing that Liuli was safe, Qin Sang immediately retracted his sword, retreated, and flew out of the Gluttonous Lake with his manifestation.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang rushed towards the Cleansing Pool on the other side of Floating Mountain.</p><p>His figure moved through the forest.</p><p>The forest was dense and lush, yet eerily silent, devoid of the usual sounds of insects and animals.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang frequently discovered various spirit herbs. While not necessarily of high grade, many were rare and difficult to find elsewhere, proving this place a treasure trove.</p><p>However, Xuan Tian Palace probably doesn't have the resources to gather these herbs right now.</p><p>I wonder how Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu plan to deal with the Demon Lord and the Sky鹏大圣 .</p><p>The people brought in by the Demon Lord were clearly a disorganized bunch, each acting independently. The Demon Lord gathered them to restrain Xuan Tian Palace and create chaos, but Xuan Tian Palace won't fall for it.</p><p>However, the Demon Lord and the Sky鹏大圣  along with their confidantes, are still a formidable force.</p><p>Their goals—forcing Xuan Tian Palace to share the sacred land, or something else—remain unknown.</p><p>Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu didn't seem worried.  Did they not know about the secret hidden in the Sacred Grounds, or were they confident that the Hunmo Elder and Tianpeng Sage would fail?</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang stopped, gazing towards the Cleansing Pool, his brow furrowed.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool was nestled in a valley on the Floating Mountain, perpetually shrouded in mist.  Legend held that no method could pierce its veil; entry required adherence to its rules.</p><p>At the valley entrance stood a nameless archway.</p><p>Several mountains surrounding the pool were dotted with crumbling pavilions and dilapidated temples, remnants of a once bustling place, now more than ninety percent ruined.</p><p>Qin Sang had earlier noticed a strange light flickering near the pool's entrance.  His delay at the Gluttonous Lake meant two others had arrived before him.</p><p>One was a demon, the Yellow Brow Demon King, whom Qin Sang recognized.  A mid-stage shapeshifter, reportedly a yellow weasel in its true form, its power was undeniable.</p><p>The other was a stranger.</p><p>Clad in full armor that concealed even their face, only their eyes were visible.  Their identity was easily guessed – the other great demon from the Boundless Sea, the Ghost General!</p><p>Qin Sang had noted that the Hunmo Elder and Tianpeng Sage headed straight for the Sacred Grounds' depths.  These two, however, had detoured to the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>Only those meeting the pool's requirements could enter directly.  Clearly, these two didn't qualify, yet, misunderstanding the situation, they believed they hadn't found the right path and were frantically attacking the archway.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to waste time with them.  Neither was it worth using the Sun God Tree.</p><p>At that moment, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly transmitted a thought.  Qin Sang's eyes narrowed; he had a plan.</p><p>…</p><p>"We've attacked for so long, and the archway remains untouched. There must be secrets we don't know; that old demon surely concealed much…"</p><p>Another fruitless attempt, the Ghost General, stymied by the archway, spoke coldly.</p><p>The Yellow Brow Demon King shook his head.  "Perhaps it wasn't deliberate concealment. The Cleansing Pool must be the most important place in Xuan Tian Palace. The Hunmo Elder managing to find this place, which offers benefits to Yuan Ying stage cultivators, is already remarkable."</p><p>He stared into the mist, his long brow twitching, toying with a wisp of yellow smoke, desperately searching for a solution.</p><p>"It seems we can only capture a Xuan Tian Palace cultivator and question them. But these fellows are cowardly and rarely travel alone, making them difficult targets…"</p><p>As he spoke, the Ghost General suddenly turned towards the distant woods, letting out a strange laugh.  "What luck! Show yourself!"</p><p>The last phrase became a roar.</p><p>The Ghost General's armor clattered, and four beams of black light shot from the gaps in the plates, landing in four directions, transforming into four colossal armored warrior statues.</p><p>The four statues opened their eyes, gazing towards the woods, emitting eight beams of black light.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>That section of the woods was instantly destroyed, engulfed in smoke and dust.</p><p>A figure emerged – Qin Sang.</p><p>"Stop wasting your efforts. You are both unworthy, and forcing it is futile," Qin Sang faced the two demon lords without fear, speaking enigmatically.</p><p>The Ghost General sneered, "You're worthy, then?  We'll make you a puppet!"</p><p>The Ghost General and Yellow Brow Demon King moved to encircle him.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Golden Sinking Sword, preparing to attack, then suddenly looked towards the ruins of an ancient building near the valley entrance, shouting, "Friend Yue, is this not the time to act?"</p><p>The warning alerted the Ghost General and Yellow Brow Demon King to the anomaly; someone had approached undetected.</p><p>They roared in anger, immediately changing their attack direction.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The remaining pavilion collapsed completely, revealing a figure who narrowly escaped the attack, looking rather disheveled – Yue, the cultivator who had attended Qin Sang's wedding with Shang Lu.</p><p>He glared at Qin Sang resentfully. If not for Qin Sang exposing his presence, he would have gotten closer and forced his way into the Cleansing Pool while his opponents were distracted.  He was also astonished; his concealment technique was a secret from the Heavenly Mountains, yet two powerful demons were completely unaware, while this person easily saw through it.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded.  Few Yuan Ying stage cultivators could simultaneously conceal themselves from him and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>"Where is Shang Zhangzuo?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>He and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly had just searched thoroughly but found no sign of Shang Lu.</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang. Had Shang Lu given up, knowing he couldn't defeat him? Otherwise, why would he come alone?</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Yue coldly snorted, refusing to answer.  He said icily, "One each! I, Yue, have long heard of the Yellow Brow Demon King's poisonous smoke, which slaughtered countless disciples of my Xuan Tian Palace. I'm here for revenge!"</p><p>The sacred site opened, activating the restrictions of the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>Time was limited. Missing the opportunity meant gaining nothing.</p><p>Though he and Qin Sang were rivals, they had to reluctantly cooperate.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond, the Yue cultivator immediately summoned a python banner and a Heavenly Mountain snow python, charging towards the Yellow Brow Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang was unfamiliar with both demons; it didn't matter which he faced.</p><p>The Yue cultivator chose the Yellow Brow Demon King, leaving Qin Sang to confront the Deceitful General.</p><p>"Arrogant!"</p><p>The Deceitful General laughed angrily, his scales opening, releasing dozens of dark rays.</p><p>Each ray contained a soldier puppet. Upon landing, they formed a strange formation with four statues, their sharp edges pointed at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Puppet Formation?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were strange.</p><p>It was similar to the Judge's corpse formation. Each puppet wasn't strong individually, but together they formed a whole, their energies intertwined, greatly increasing their power.</p><p>However, after his Sky Eye Butterfly's advancement, he feared such tactics the least.  No matter how subtle the changes, they were visible under his divine power.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, slashing with his sword, secretly using his spiritual sense to cooperate with the Sky Eye Butterfly, breaking the formation.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The sword light just struck.</p><p>The puppet formation's dark light intensified, condensing a fierce axe in mid-air, striking towards the sword light.  Simultaneously, the soldier puppets stomped in unison, their killing intent soaring.</p><p>Qin Sang held his Golden Sinking Sword above his head. A strange look flashed in his eyes, and he advanced instead of retreating, charging into the puppet formation.</p><p>This greatly surprised the Deceitful General.</p><p>He paused slightly, becoming even angrier.  He stamped his foot, and the four statues came alive, acting like generals leading soldiers, creating a killing array to trap Qin Sang.</p><p>In an instant, the puppet formation changed drastically.</p><p>But in the Sky Eye Butterfly's eyes, everything had a clear pattern.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled through the formation, calmly wielding the Golden Sinking Sword, sending out sword lights to different locations, each strike perfectly executed.</p><p>The formation immediately felt sluggish.</p><p>This quick understanding of the puppet formation was due to two factors.</p><p>Firstly, it was the Sky Eye Butterfly's merit.</p><p>Secondly, Qin Sang had learned a lot about puppetry from his senior sister Qing Jun, and though not an expert, his insight was excellent.</p><p>He clearly sensed that the Deceitful General was inferior to his senior sister in puppetry!</p><p>The Deceitful General was shocked. Before he could react, a sharp sword cry echoed through the formation, and several puppets shattered!</p><p>The loss of these puppets didn't bother the Deceitful General.</p><p>However, one statue puppet was exposed to the sword's edge.</p><p>The Deceitful General never expected his puppet formation to be broken so easily.  Although not his strongest ability, it was his claim to fame, known as a one-man army.</p><p>Yet, before this person, it was so easily defeated!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword locked onto a statue puppet, striking its chest precisely.</p><p>This was the puppet's weakness.</p><p>The statue puppet immediately stiffened, its chest pierced, creating a hole that emitted bright white light. The entire puppet began to crumble from there.</p><p>In a blink, it shattered!</p><p>The Deceitful General flew into a rage, slamming his forehead.  His helmet cracked, revealing a vertical eye.</p><p>The eye had no pupil, only a black shadow.</p><p>The vertical pupil opened, and a human-shaped black shadow emerged, its features twisted in apparent pain.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang sensed something amiss and looked over, his eyes filled with solemnity.  He felt a threat from the shadow.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>Several points of light appeared outside the Floating Mountain.  Judging by their direction, they were Xuan Tian Palace cultivators, likely including elders or hall masters.</p><p>All four in the battle noticed the approaching figures.</p><p>Although furious, the Deceitful General remained calm. His opponent hadn't even used any serious techniques, breaking his puppet formation with a few simple sword strikes.</p><p>The Old Man Hun Mo and the Great Saint Tian Peng were not here; more Xuan Tian Palace cultivators would only increase their danger.</p><p>Using his trump card and gaining nothing was unacceptable.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The Deceitful General glared at Qin Sang, forcibly pushing the shadow back, shouting at the Yellow Brow Demon King, and prepared to leave.</p><p>"Leave your puppets behind!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to continue fighting the Deceitful General, and used the Green Bamboo Sword Scripture to its fullest, turning his sword into thousands, engulfing the entire puppet formation.</p><p>"I'll remember you!"</p><p>The Deceitful General left this threat, retrieving less than half his puppets.</p><p>After Qin Sang collected the abandoned puppets, intending to study them, he discovered that the Yue cultivator was extremely alert and had already entered the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the distant figures, no longer hesitating, and dashed to the archway below.</p><p>He met the requirements and faced no obstacles.</p><p>The moment he stepped under the archway, Qin Sang felt an invisible pressure descend, the surrounding scenery vanishing, leaving only white mist.</p>
