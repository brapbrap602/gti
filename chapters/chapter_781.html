<h1>Chapter 773: Revenge is a dish best served cold</h1><p>Qin Sang had the Flying Night Fiend scout ahead, anticipating various scenarios.</p><p>If there was a Ghost King and he was outmatched, there was nothing to be said; he'd abandon the Fiend and flee.</p><p>If the opponent's strength was limited, with his escape speed, he could quickly reinforce the Fiend.</p><p>But he never expected this situation.</p><p>A Nascent Soul level Corpse Refinement like the Flying Night Fiend was incredibly rare. Even a Ghost Cultivator specializing in Corpse Refinement would need to expend untold effort to create one.</p><p>Qin Sang was still planning to delve deeper into Ghost Cultivation techniques to further enhance the Fiend, but unexpectedly, this happened.</p><p>The Flying Night Fiend was heavily injured, and its strength was compromised.</p><p>If the opponent was powerful, the Fiend wouldn't even have a chance to resist and would likely have been subdued upon entering the Ghost Lands.</p><p>The opponent's actions suggested that its strength wasn't high, but perhaps it possessed a method to counter Corpse Refinements.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang was unafraid and dared to pursue.</p><p>He suspected that the opponent dragged away the Fiend and painstakingly concealed the soul mark, rather than destroying it, possibly because it coveted the physical body.</p><p>The opponent was most likely a lone ghost.</p><p>"If its cultivation wasn't high, wouldn't it have taken my body instead?"</p><p>This thought enraged Qin Sang.</p><p>Soon, he stopped where the soul mark connection broke, looking around.  The area remained empty; the opponent was cunning, leaving no trace.</p><p>Qin Sang could only choose a direction and continue flying, eventually reaching a cliff face, completely losing the opponent's trail.</p><p>The opponent was not only extremely cautious but also adept at concealment. Qin Sang found nothing.</p><p>His powerful asset was taken without him even seeing the opponent's face.</p><p>Unwilling to give up, Qin Sang gritted his teeth and began searching the Ghost Lands.</p><p>Blinding escape light crisscrossed the ghostly mist, searching extensively. Qin Sang practically turned the Ghost Lands upside down, even carefully examining the surrounding cliffs.</p><p>After all this time, he found nothing.</p><p>The Flying Night Fiend seemed to have vanished into thin air. No matter how Qin Sang urged the soul mark, there was no response.</p><p>"I can't keep wasting time here…"</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the exit of the Ghost Lands, staring at the dense ghost mist, feeling helpless.</p><p>He hadn't obtained the Nine Netherworld Devil Fire, and now he'd lost a valuable asset.</p><p>Searching the ghost mist had consumed too much time; he had to leave for the Celestial Tower.</p><p>"If only the Skyeye Butterfly had reached its third transformation. Under its gaze, those ghosts and monsters would have nowhere to hide... If you dare, cross the Nine Netherworld Devil Fire and escape. Otherwise, when I return, I will find you."</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, consoling himself with the thought that revenge is a dish best served cold.</p><p>Shrouded by thick ghost mist, he felt powerless.</p><p>While he possessed a Corpse Pill, he wasn't a true Ghost Cultivator. In the ghost mist, his spiritual sense was still greatly restricted.</p><p>The opponent, however, could move freely. With its strange escape technique, even if it were following close behind, he probably wouldn't notice.</p><p>It was a pity that the Skyeye Butterfly was dormant due to its mutation, delaying its transformation and failing to complete its third metamorphosis. Otherwise, Qin Sang could have easily seen through the mist.</p><p>Violent fluctuations arose in the ghost mist, and a large swarm of resentful spirits rushed out.</p><p>These were stirred up by his search.</p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p>Qin Sang said coldly, his expression unchanged.</p><p>A fierce wind erupted, and rolling true essence transformed into a rainbow of light, sweeping the resentful spirits back.</p><p>Qin Sang took one last look at the Ghost Lands, erased his traces, restrained his true essence, donned a fire shield, and flashed to the Devil Fire.</p><p>After Qin Sang left, the resentful spirits, having lost their target, gradually settled down. The Ghost Lands returned to their previous quiet, the ghost mist calmed, flowing gently as if nothing had changed.</p><p>Passing through the Devil Fire, he returned to the canyon exit.</p><p>Qin Sang turned, stood for a moment, summoned the Fat Silkworm, and quietly left.</p><p>After exiting the canyon, instead of returning the way he came, Qin Sang stealthily approached the Violet Crystal Lake, hoping to steal another crystal and provide more food for the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>However, before he got close, he sensed a powerful aura lingering around the lake, making his hair stand on end.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded. He didn't dare approach any further and carefully retreated.</p><p>"The leader of the beasts has been alerted and is personally guarding the lake.  The entire pack must have moved here; there are more than ten times as many beasts around the lake as before.  It seems I can't target the crystals for now.  You'll have to make do with these two," Qin Sang said to the Fat Silkworm, which wore an equally helpless expression.</p><p>Unable to proceed, Qin Sang retreated.</p><p>He returned to the base of the cliff, found his previous descent point, and climbed back up.</p><p>On his return, Qin Sang passed the location where the ancient divine platform had appeared. The ground was now flat, all traces gone.</p><p>The chaotic battle at the first stone palace hadn't subsided, so Qin Sang chose a detour.  He reached the Violet Star Eagle Canyon, passed through easily, and finally left the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>Free from the poisonous mist, the Fat Silkworm retracted its poison-repelling armor and immediately scurried into its basket, hugging its demon pill and falling fast asleep.</p><p>It had exhausted itself resisting the poison mist on this journey.</p><p>Without the poisonous mist, Qin Sang's vision broadened, and his mood eased slightly.</p><p>Of course, this didn't mean it was safer outside the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone.  Outside, he not only had to avoid various beasts but also be wary of other cultivators.</p><p>"The Celestial Tower is to the north. The forest is fraught with danger.  It's better to return the way I came and then cross the wasteland to the tower."</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision, identified his direction, and along with the Two-Headed Serpent, plunged into the forest, disappearing among the ancient trees.</p><p>…</p><p>In the canyon.</p><p>The Devil Fire hung in the air, seemingly eternal.</p><p>An unknown amount of time after Qin Sang left.</p><p>A ripple appeared within the poisonous mist, followed by a figure slowly emerging.</p><p>There was no visible protective shield around him, yet he moved freely within the poisonous mist. The mist landed on his black robe and was gently repelled, unable to penetrate.</p><p>This was the depths of the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone, where the poison was extremely potent. This person's ability to move so easily suggested he either possessed a powerful poison-repelling treasure or had incredibly high cultivation.</p><p>The figure gradually emerged from the mist, revealing his face.</p><p>He appeared to be around forty, tall and imposing. His aura clearly didn't match his appearance; he was older than he looked, with deep-set eyes that inspired awe.</p><p>Upon seeing the Nine Netherworld Devil Fire, his eyes lit up with fervor and obsession.</p><p>"This time, I refuse to fail in subduing you…"</p><p>He muttered to himself, but mid-sentence, his expression suddenly changed drastically.  His figure flickered, and he vanished.</p><p>Concealed, his gaze swept across the canyon, finally fixating on the gap between the Devil Fire and the cliff face.  Moments later, an expression of utter shock spread across his face.</p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p>He exclaimed internally, disbelief etched on his face. "Even I can't withstand the erosion, how could anyone cross the canyon?  No, he not only went in, but he also came out alive…"</p>
