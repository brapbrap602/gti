<h1>Chapter 681: The Monster Hunting Squad</h1><p>Qin Sang's actions were observed by Ran Luo and the others, and they warmed to him, the initial distance between them gradually disappearing. Even the young Master Zhuo, who was supposed to be the chief artificer, after several exchanges on crafting techniques with Qin Sang, had long since relinquished what little animosity he had held.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang also gained quite a bit.</p><p>However, while making acquaintances, Qin Sang always maintained a certain reserve; it was difficult for him to fully trust anyone now.</p><p>After conversing with Master Zhuo, Qin Sang learned that Master Zhuo's sect, the Sword Cauldron Sect, was indeed a renowned crafting sect in the Boundless Sea.  Qin Sang found an opportunity to discuss the Ten Divine Woods with him.</p><p>Master Zhuo expressed his regret, explaining that due to limited talent, he wasn't highly regarded within his sect and had to venture out on his own.  He had no access to the sect's core secrets and didn't know if any of the crafting sects in the Boundless Sea possessed any of the Ten Divine Woods. However, in his hundred years at the Sword Cauldron Sect, he had never heard of anyone obtaining any of them.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that over the past six months, Ran Luo had procured four live Flood Dragons for him.</p><p>After absorbing their spirits, Qin Sang had accumulated the spirits of six Flood Dragons within the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman. Back then, Daoist Xuanyu had expended considerable effort to gather so many.</p><p>Qin Sang went to an uninhabited area near Island Duyan and tested the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman combined with his Sword Qi Thunder Sound technique.  His escape speed now surpassed that of ordinary mid-Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>His ability to flee from danger had greatly improved.</p><p>Qin Sang spent several more months on Island Duyan and finally neared the completion of his tasks.</p><p>Since Ran Luo hadn't been able to find any more live Flood Dragons, Qin Sang decided to go out to sea himself to hunt for their spirits. Once he gathered ten Flood Dragon spirits, the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman would undergo a qualitative transformation!</p><p>When Qin Sang went to Ran Luo, she didn't try to stop him and, as per his request, helped him find a reliable squad.</p><p>"Daoist, according to the information obtained by the merchant guild, Flood Dragons occasionally appear in the southern edges of the Deep Trench. However, in addition to Spirit Severing Flood Dragons, Core Formation Flood Dragons have also been sighted in the depths of the trench. The Flood Dragon bloodline is among the strongest in the demon race, and they are not easy to deal with. It might be better to wait a while longer. When Huiwen returns, she can accompany you as support." Ran Luo advised.</p><p>Qin Sang had specifically requested a squad composed of Foundation Establishment cultivators, with himself as the only Core Formation cultivator. Ran Luo was somewhat worried.</p><p>He made this request because he considered that if he traveled with cultivators of comparable strength, dividing the spoils might cause disputes. Moreover, they wouldn't willingly follow the orders of a cultivator of the same realm.</p><p>Bringing these cultivators, though slightly weaker, would be more manageable. As long as they were cautious and avoided provoking late-Core Formation demons, Qin Sang was confident in his ability to escape if necessary.</p><p>Huiwen had left Island Duyan not long ago and would need some time to return. There weren't many Core Formation cultivators from the merchant guild on the island, and they all had their own responsibilities.</p><p>"No need to trouble Fellow Daoist Huiwen. I only intend to target peak Spirit Severing Flood Dragons this time. Once I gather enough Flood Dragon spirits, I'll return immediately. There won't be any danger." Qin Sang declined.</p><p>Ran Luo couldn't persuade him further and ordered someone to bring the monster hunting squad over, introducing their background to Qin Sang.</p><p>"There are five people in the squad, recruited into the merchant guild six months ago, before Manager Ning departed. Although their cultivation isn't high, they have been operating around Island Duyan for many years and have a decent reputation. Most importantly, they have spent a considerable amount of time in the southern part of the Deep Trench and are very familiar with the local demon races. They have unique methods for both tracking and early warning. Of course, I've already instructed them to follow your every command at sea…"</p><p>Ran Luo introduced the squad members to Qin Sang.</p><p>All five members were Foundation Establishment cultivators, drawn to the Demon Sea with hopes of reaching Core Formation. They had formed their squad on Island Duyan, gradually building trust amongst themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang memorized their information.  He valued their familiarity with the areas where Flood Dragons appeared, intending to utilize them as guides and trackers.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang met the five cultivators.</p><p>"We greet Daoist Qingfeng," they said in unison, bowing to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sat and observed the five before him.</p><p>Three women and two men.  Two of the younger women bore a striking resemblance, clearly sisters.  They reminded Qin Sang of the Le sisters from the Small Cold Region. It was rare to see two sisters, both散修 , achieving such high cultivation levels.</p><p>An older woman and a man in a green robe were a couple.  They were both over two hundred years old, their faces etched with fatigue and the passage of time.  At their age, reaching Core Formation was nearly impossible.</p><p>Ran Luo had mentioned that the couple had been in the Boundless Sea for several decades. Fortunately, they hadn't encountered any life-threatening situations, but unfortunately, they hadn't succeeded in forming their cores.  They had a son cultivating in the Inner Sea.</p><p>Now, they had given up on Core Formation, dedicating their remaining time to accumulating resources for their son.</p><p>The last member was a middle-aged man in gray robes, a sword cultivator.</p><p>These five appeared ordinary, but Qin Sang sensed a faint, lingering killing intent about them. Even as they bowed, their positioning was meticulous, maintaining constant awareness of each other.  This was a hallmark of cultivators seasoned in battle.</p><p>Having spent years in the chaotic waters of the Scattered Islands, surviving countless battles, Qin Sang could easily discern these subtleties.</p><p>Working together, these five could likely pose a threat to an unwary early-Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>"There's no need for formalities. Once we leave the island, I'll need your assistance. If you have any suggestions, feel free to voice them. As long as they are reasonable, I will certainly heed them." Qin Sang rose, his gaze sweeping over each of them, his tone suddenly turning serious. "However, if anyone acts without my permission, disobeys my commands, I won't hesitate to add another life to my sword!"</p><p>As his voice fell, a surge of killing intent erupted from Qin Sang.  The intensity, honed by his cultivation and years of experience, even startled Ran Luo.</p><p>The five were shocked and quickly expressed their obedience.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction. "There's no time to lose.  Return and make your preparations. We depart tomorrow."</p><p>The next morning, six figures quietly left Island Duyan.</p><p>They initially flew west, then after a series of diversions, turned southeast.</p><p>Qin Sang had the elderly couple lead the way, following behind them with his Netherworld Cloud.  Observing their caution, Qin Sang approved. Surviving for decades in the Demon Sea required skill.</p><p>To accommodate them, Qin Sang slowed his pace, also taking the opportunity to observe the environment of the Demon Sea.</p><p>In such a dangerous place, ambushes could occur at any time. Even the altitude of flight was crucial.  The elderly couple answered all his questions, and Qin Sang gained valuable experience.</p>
