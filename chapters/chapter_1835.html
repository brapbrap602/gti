<h1>Chapter 1826: The Great Vajra Wheel Seal</h1><p>A clear sword heart, severing spiritual interference.</p><p>This was one of Qin Sang's greatest gains during his comprehension of the Chengying Sword Inheritance.</p><p>Part of the credit must be attributed to Zhenren Zhijian.</p><p>Over several decades, Qin Sang journeyed back and forth between Jushan and Nie Yuan numerous times, always visiting Zhenren Zhijian first.</p><p>While it was said they engaged in philosophical discussions, in reality, it was mostly Qin Sang seeking guidance.</p><p>Zhenren Zhijian was a rare and insightful teacher.  He had not obtained the Chengying Sword Inheritance, yet possessed a profound understanding of the Sword Dao.</p><p>He did not set a fixed path for Qin Sang, but instead offered concise and essential guidance, illuminating the true meaning, allowing Qin Sang to cross-reference his own understanding with the Chengying Sword Inheritance and forge his own unique path.</p><p>Qin Sang was like a student, receiving instruction from his teacher, returning to secluded cultivation to grapple with new challenges, and then seeking further guidance.</p><p>Thus, although Qin Sang hadn't devoted all his energy to the Chengying Sword in recent years, his progress was still evident.</p><p>Using the same killing formations and the same White Tiger Fiendish Aura, compared to thirty years ago, the power Qin Sang now wielded showed a marked difference, not solely due to increased cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang named this newly comprehended sword technique "Sword from the Heart Sea."</p><p>By maintaining an undisturbed sword heart, he could sense killing intent in the vicinity.</p><p>Saint King Qinghu, ambushed as he was, couldn't possibly maintain a tranquil mind. Once locked onto by the sword heart, even escaping with secret techniques wouldn't sever the connection to the sword intent.  Wherever Qin Sang's sword heart reached, his sword intent followed, erupting in a lethal strike.</p><p>Before the battle began, Tianmu Die had discovered the special mark left by Saint King Qinghu outside the palace.</p><p>After all, when facing a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, it was highly likely that Saint King Qinghu would have a contingency plan.</p><p>Qin Sang's move was a gamble, but one with a degree of certainty.  Should he succeed, the rewards would be immense.</p><p>The Chengying Sword Inheritance, Zhenren Zhijian's guidance, and his prior comprehension of the Killing Dao had opened the true gates of the Sword Dao for Qin Sang.</p><p>Previously, he had considered himself a seasoned swordsman, but in truth, he had remained at the level of technique. This new sword technique allowed him to finally touch upon the threshold of the 'Dao.'</p><p>In Qin Sang's heart, his admiration for Zhenren Zhijian grew with each encounter.  Perhaps his cultivation realm wasn't the highest, but in terms of understanding the Sword Dao, he had yet to see anyone surpass him.  Zhenren Zhijian's potential was surely far greater than what he currently displayed.</p><p>Qin Sang envied this talent but felt no jealousy. He eagerly anticipated the achievements this fellow Daoist would attain, yet couldn't help but feel a pang of regret for Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't fathom why Zhenren Zhijian offered him such meticulous guidance.</p><p>Perhaps it was a effortless act of kindness for Zhenren Zhijian, a profound revelation for Qin Sang yet merely a casual remark for him.</p><p>Perhaps it stemmed from their past encounter and a shared temperament.</p><p>Perhaps he had an ulterior motive.</p><p>Since ancient times, actions speak louder than words. Qin Sang hoped for the former. If Zhenren Zhijian had other intentions, as long as they weren't detrimental to him, he would reciprocate with all his might.</p><p>Fortunately, he had acquired the Poison Arts and the Flower Field, allowing his cultivation to advance by leaps and bounds, granting him the ability to repay such kindness.</p><p>Sheathing his sword.</p><p>Clenching his fists.</p><p>Qin Sang slightly narrowed his eyes. His phoenix wings beat powerfully, his figure transforming into a flash of lightning, a thunderous clap echoing through the heavens!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Lightning illuminated the grand hall, reaching the well platform in an instant, colliding abruptly with a faint deer silhouette.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A heavy fist slammed out.</p><p>The deer silhouette countered with its antlers.</p><p>Both figures trembled violently, separating upon impact, each retreating.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped back in midair, stopping forcibly just three zhang from the well platform. He coldly stared at the demon below, issuing a chilling question, "Do you intend to contend with this poor Daoist for this treasure?"</p><p>Xiahou, having manifested his black deer demon form, landed heavily on the ground with a 'bang,' shaking the palace.</p><p>Mo Xingdao had slaughtered the demon soldiers and fled the battlefield, leaving only Qin Sang and Xiahou within the palace.</p><p>Xiahou slightly raised its head, narrowing its demonic eyes, letting out a disdainful snort. However, a flicker of surprise and vigilance flashed through its eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang's sudden entry into the battle had startled Xiahou. Initially, it assumed Qin Sang was an accomplice Saint King Qinghu had placed in ambush.</p><p>Later, seeing Qin Sang directly target Saint King Qinghu with ruthless attacks, as if driven by deep hatred, it immediately formed a plan. After breaking free, it stealthily approached the Five Elements Crown, preparing to seize the treasure amidst the chaos.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Saint King Qinghu was defeated so swiftly. After all, the cultivation Qin Sang displayed wasn't particularly high. Even with a surprise attack, Saint King Qinghu, if not evenly matched, should have been able to hold out for a while.</p><p>This single exchange revealed that Saint King Qinghu's defeat was no accident.</p><p>"Who are you?!"</p><p>Xiahou, having gotten a clear look at Qin Sang, felt a sense of unease.</p><p>His skin was rough like bark, resembling a wood spirit. His physical body was translucent, like a crystalline monster. Covered in green fur, wreathed in poisonous smoke, he resembled a venomous creature that had attained enlightenment, yet he also possessed a pair of phoenix wings.</p><p>These phoenix wings closely resembled the wings of the legendary divine beast, the Azure Phoenix. Xiahou had been fortunate enough to see images of ancient divine beasts in the royal palace, and Qin Sang's wings were almost indistinguishable from the real thing.</p><p>None of those who claimed to be descendants of the Phoenix possessed wings so similar to the true phoenix wings.</p><p>Xiahou was bewildered.  Since Qin Sang wasn't an accomplice of Saint King Qinghu and didn't resemble a Daoist cultivator, even considering all the demons and monsters of the Guifang Kingdom, he couldn't find a match for this creature.</p><p>Where had Saint King Qinghu provoked such a being?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bother with idle chatter. Halting his retreat, he immediately charged forward.</p><p>He was clad in the Returning Wind Armor and wore gauntlets, but under the radiant glow of the glazed treasure, they appeared almost transparent.</p><p>The Four-Serpent Seal and the Nine Nether Demon Fire were both withdrawn, even the Grey Warbler Sword served only as a backup.  He intended to confront Xiahou head-on with pure physical strength and his spiritwood body!</p><p>His divine sense was restricted, and his true essence was only at the early Nascent Soul stage, requiring careful management.</p><p>His confidence stemmed from the Seven Masters Buddha Seal, which now should be called the Great Vajra Wheel Seal!</p><p>The consecutive battles against Saint King Qinghu and Xiahou had given him immense confidence.</p><p>Finally, today, he had combined the seven seals into one, comprehending this seal.</p><p>Just as he had suspected, the Seven Masters Buddha Seal was a disassembled version of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal. Some unknown expert had divided a single powerful Buddha Seal into seven, providing a path for those seeking to comprehend it.</p><p>Of all the Daoist arts and divine abilities Qin Sang had mastered, cultivating this seal had been the smoothest.</p><p>Employing the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, he transformed into a Vajra Glazed Body, his body resembling pure glazed glass.</p><p>His physical cultivation had reached the Nascent Soul stage, his primordial essence circulating within him, drawing the power of heaven and earth into his body, faintly forming the rudiments of an inner world.  His body transformed into glazed glass, stabilizing the inner world, making each movement and technique extraordinarily powerful.</p><p>This method of cultivation wasn't without its drawbacks. Qin Sang had a vague feeling that the Great Vajra Wheel Seal was profound and vast, and each individual's comprehension would differ.  The Buddha Seal he employed was different from that of the monk in the image.</p><p>After comprehending the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, Qin Sang discovered that the Inner Lion Seal had also been enhanced.</p><p>The Inner Lion Seal specialized in healing and recovery, while the Great Vajra Wheel Seal brought about a comprehensive improvement.</p><p>He wondered about the power of the other seven seals.</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously speculated that, in all likelihood, they were similar to the Inner Lion Seal, each having its own focus.</p><p>Based on this deduction, the Great Vajra Wheel Seal was likely the foundational seal of the Nine Luminous Seals!</p><p>Those with exceptional talent, through independent comprehension, would gain even more, perhaps even using it to comprehend the Buddhist Vajra Dao.  However, Qin Sang had merely followed an established path, not achieving true independent comprehension.</p><p>Nevertheless, physical power wasn't Qin Sang's foundation.  He was content with the formidable power of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.</p><p>Qin Sang strode forward, not utilizing Thunder Escape, further displaying his imposing aura, his pressure radiating in all directions.</p><p>Xiahou's pupils constricted slightly, glancing at the Five Elements Crown on the well platform.</p><p>Judging by Saint King Qinghu's previous cautious behavior, they could guess that this treasure wouldn't be easy to acquire.  A slight misstep could incur unbearable backlash.</p><p>Neither he nor Qin Sang dared to rashly collect the treasure, and they even tried to avoid provoking the artifact spirit, lest it become the other's accomplice.</p><p>Now, it came down to whose strength was greater, to repel or even slay the opponent!</p><p>Qin Sang exuded powerful confidence, and Xiahou was equally unwilling to show weakness.  Having transformed into the black deer, its strength had returned to its peak.</p><p>Lowering its head slightly, black light erupted from the tips of its antlers, black energy surging forth, repeating its previous tactic, about to condense a vortex.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>Amidst the rising winds and surging clouds, the black energy howled.</p><p>Black clouds instantly billowed before Qin Sang, obscuring the sky and blocking out the sun.</p><p>The black energy threatened to engulf Qin Sang, and at the center of the black energy, the nascent form of a vortex gradually materialized.</p><p>Just then, a streak of light suddenly shot into the center of the vortex.</p><p>This streak of light was exceptionally fine, originating from Qin Sang's dantian - it was Tianmu Die's Heavenly Eye Divine Light.</p><p>The divine light, capable of breaking through techniques, had been ready since the confrontation with Saint King Qinghu but hadn't been used.</p><p>Compared to the black energy, the Heavenly Eye Divine Light appeared incredibly weak, yet the moment it pierced the vortex, the black energy vortex abruptly exploded.</p><p>With a roar, the momentum of the black energy was drastically reduced.</p><p>Xiahou watched helplessly as Qin Sang broke through the black energy, rapidly approaching with Thunder Escape.  It was startled, hastily retreating.  In its haste, it opened its mouth wide, spewing crimson breath that transformed into crimson lightning, striking towards Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Qin Sang only felt a flash of crimson before his eyes, a fierce wind assaulting his face. He let out a cold snort, twisting his right arm, his fist smashing heavily into the lightning.</p><p>With a violent clap of thunder, his fist struck the crimson lightning dead on. The lightning solidified, then shattered inch by inch.</p><p>Qin Sang's momentum remained fierce as he continued to charge forward.</p><p>Xiahou, having witnessed Saint King Qinghu's fate, wouldn't be caught off guard.  It had already secretly employed a divine ability. Qin Sang's deliberate attack was also its opportunity!</p><p>A radiance immediately surfaced on its back.</p><p>As the strange light surged, a black and white deer silhouette leaped powerfully into the air, its legs stomping down heavily.</p><p>Qin Sang instantly felt an astonishing pressure descend upon him, enveloped by a black shadow, a giant deer leg descending from above, shattering the void!</p><p>An ordinary person subjected to this attack would be crushed into a pulp on the spot.</p><p>Qin Sang slightly raised his head, his expression unreadable in the shadow.  His gaze was deep, both fists raised, slamming towards the hoof of the descending deer leg.</p><p>With this strike, his arms and even his entire body reverberated with a sound like thunder, yet also as crisp as shattering jade.</p><p>At the tips of his fists, the void seemed to distort, a phenomenon manifested by the sheer force of his strike, appearing both overwhelmingly powerful and yet as yielding as water, a perfect blend of hardness and softness.</p><p>Fist and hoof connected.</p><p>A burst of black light erupted.  Qin Sang was immediately slammed to the ground, but his form remained steady, his feet retreating three steps.</p><p>The deer leg, carrying residual force, stomped heavily on the ground before Qin Sang, then dissipated, failing to inflict any damage.</p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p>Xiahou was shocked. It hadn't expected Qin Sang to handle it so easily.</p><p>This divine ability was its proudest creation.</p><p>The deer silhouette it conjured wasn't a true Dharma Idol, but with this strike, it had integrated its own comprehension of heaven and earth, imbued with heavenly might, the most potent aspect of this divine ability.</p><p>Those with inferior realms, facing this attack, would be subjected to the oppressive weight of heavenly might, inherently a step below their opponent.</p><p>Although Qin Sang was powerful, Xiahou had seen through him. His strength relied entirely on Daoist arts, divine abilities, and external objects.</p><p>The disparity in their comprehension of the power of heaven and earth was difficult to overcome with Daoist arts and divine abilities. Had it not been for the Five Elements Crown's overly fierce attack, it wouldn't have been so passive against Saint King Qinghu, forced to resort to its innate divine ability.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang seemed completely unaffected, the power of his fists showing no signs of suppression.</p><p>A strange look crossed Xiahou's face. The fact that the opponent wasn't suppressed by the heavenly might effectively neutralized the greatest difference between their realms.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang pushed off the ground, charging forward again, defying the pressure.</p><p>A spark of excitement flickered in his eyes, stemming from his comprehension of the Killing Dao.  Slaying Saint King Qinghu had brought a sense of satisfaction far surpassing that of hunting ferocious beasts.</p><p>Enemies, all slain!</p><p>Those who competed for opportunities, slain as well!</p><p>Qin Sang realized something, as if the figure of the creator of the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" appeared before him.</p><p>That person emerged from mountains of corpses and seas of blood, awakening from boundless slaughter, thereafter restraining his killing intent, sheathing his sword, drawing it only with cause.</p><p>Once the sword was drawn, regardless of the enemy's strength, he faced them without fear, advancing relentlessly.</p><p>One battle to sever all karmic ties!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes grew brighter, letting out a rare long howl, his aura soaring.</p><p>The black deer's expression faltered, unexpectedly feeling a sense of suppression from Qin Sang.  It couldn't help but snort angrily, "Relying on a single divine ability to act ferociously, I'd like to see how long you can last!"</p><p>It saw that Qin Sang wasn't purely a physical cultivator.  The black flames were ordinary, and while the spiritual treasure and sword formation posed a threat, limited by Qin Sang's cultivation, they were inferior to the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's reliance, and such a powerful divine ability must consume a great deal of energy.  Qin Sang's vitality couldn't possibly be as enduring as its own!</p><p>With a snort, Xiahou charged towards Qin Sang, leaping forward, leaving a series of afterimages in the void, its antlers thrusting towards Qin Sang's head like swords.</p><p>Although Xiahou was in deer form, in Qin Sang's eyes, there was no difference.  Excitement mixed with composure, he shifted the True Treasure fragment to his palm, catching the antlers, his body trembling violently.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, man and deer became locked in combat, two Nascent Soul powerhouses engaging in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>In the vast hall, the Five Elements Crown floated quietly on the well platform, bearing witness.</p><p>A mass of black light moved continuously within the hall, only flickering shadows visible within, their true forms indiscernible.</p><p>The battle continued, with no clear victor.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to have exhausted his tricks, with no stronger methods to employ.</p><p>Xiahou also seemed to be genuinely wearing down Qin Sang, or perhaps wary of the Heavenly Eye Divine Light, rarely using divine abilities.</p><p>Just as the fight reached a stalemate, a strange look flashed in Xiahou's eyes. Its two antlers detached without warning, instantly merging into one, resembling a fan riddled with holes.  It swung this fan forcefully towards Qin Sang.</p><p>This attack was too sudden.</p><p>It hadn't used this even when ambushing Hong Yuzi and being ambushed by Saint King Qinghu.</p><p>The wind howled, forming a wind pillar around Qin Sang. A shadow fell over Qin Sang as he felt an immense restrictive force.</p><p>The five tips of the antlers shimmered with cold light, shooting out five crescent-shaped blades of chilling light.</p><p>In an instant, the crescent blades intersected.</p><p>Each blade was like a spatial rift. Even if the True Treasure fragment could block one, it couldn't possibly block all five.</p><p>Xiahou, clearly having lulled Qin Sang into a false sense of security, revealed a ferocious glint in its eyes, licking its lips, but suddenly froze.</p><p>A resounding phoenix cry echoed from within the wind pillar.</p><p>An Azure Phoenix soared, the wind pillar posing no obstacle.  As its azure feathers fluttered, the divine aura it emanated instantly reminded Xiahou of the Azure Phoenix in the image.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix spread its wings wide, then swooped down, transforming into a beam of azure light, merging with Qin Sang.</p><p>The next moment, within the wind pillar, an overwhelmingly powerful aura erupted!
