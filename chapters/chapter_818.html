<h1>Chapter 810: Timeline</h1><p>Sect Leader Wu owed his present achievements to the guidance of the Island Lord of Turtle Island. He held deep gratitude for the Island Lord, considering him his mentor. Recalling the Island Lord's fate, he was filled with grief and indignation.</p><p>This outcome was unexpected for Qin Sang.  Elder Qing Zhu had concealed his identity and lived in such a remote area, perhaps to avoid an enemy?  And someone had found him and razed his cave to the ground.</p><p>He remembered Elder Qing Zhu's message left in the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Three large characters, all sighs, filled with endless sorrow.</p><p>Could it be that Elder Qing Zhu had a premonition and left this final message?</p><p>"When did this happen? What was the identity of the Island Lordâ€™s enemy?" Qin Sang, unwilling to return empty-handed, inquired about the details.</p><p>"Just two years ago!"</p><p>Sect Leader Wu revealed a timeframe that astonished Qin Sang.  He hadn't expected it to be so recent, shortly after the Seven Kills Hall opened this time.</p><p>This meant that Elder Qing Zhu was still in the Boundless Sea until the incident!</p><p>"No one knows who the enemy was; the Elder never mentioned it. We were only allowed to listen to his lectures on the island; he never formally accepted any disciples.</p><p>"On the day of the incident, I was cultivating in the mountains. I later learned from rumors that the battle was terrifying, with world-shattering power. Turtle Island was completely destroyed. Some say only a Nascent Soul ancestor could cause such devastation.</p><p>"After the incident, everyone was terrified. We were grateful for the Elder's kindness, but due to our low cultivation, we could do nothing, not even dare to express our thoughts..."</p><p>Sect Leader Wu seemed to have bottled up his feelings for a long time.  Finding Qin Sang as a listener, he couldn't hold back anymore, his voice raspy with emotion.</p><p>"Did anyone witness the battle, see the outcome with their own eyes?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe Elder Qing Zhu could be killed so easily.</p><p>Elder Qing Zhu had been transported to the Boundless Sea nearly three hundred years ago.  At that time, he was already approaching the peak of the Core Formation stage, despite simultaneously cultivating and creating his own techniques.</p><p>Given Elder Qing Zhu's talent, it was hard to imagine his current level of achievement.  If someone told him Elder Qing Zhu had become a late Nascent Soul grand cultivator, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised. Even if he couldn't win, could he truly have no chance of escape?</p><p>Sect Leader Wu sighed. "Palm Island is not far from Turtle Island. The battle alarmed the cultivators there, and many witnessed it. Some got too close and were caught in the crossfire, leaving no trace.  It is said that at the end of the battle, a demonic figure laughed maniacally, and from beginning to end, no one escaped from the island..."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Sect Leader Wu continued, "The Elder seemed to have foreseen this disaster. Years ago, after a lecture, he mentioned that he would leave this place and would no longer hold lectures. The island would be closed off. For years, Turtle Island was sealed by a grand formation. We thought the Elder was gone, and some even forgot about him. It wasn't until the incident two years ago that we realized he had never left, but had remained to avoid his enemy, yet still couldn't escape this calamity."</p><p>Qin Sang pressed further, "So, even if the Elder hadn't met his demise, I would have come in vain? Do you remember when the island was sealed?"</p><p>Sect Leader Wu thought for a moment. "It's been over fifty years. At the time, I was only at the Qi Refining stage, practically ignorant of cultivation. I relied entirely on self-study, making many mistakes. It was by listening to the Elder's lectures that I achieved Foundation Establishment."</p><p>Fifty years!</p><p>Cultivator Wang was already traveling abroad at that time, so he didn't know about the island's closure.</p><p>This information was crucial.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. It was the same time the Seven Kills Hall appeared on its own, and when the Violet Palace opened.</p><p>It was definitely not a coincidence!</p><p>Qin Sang realized that Elder Qing Zhu's words likely weren't empty. He might have found a teleportation formation and planned to leave not only the Windcrack Islands, but also the Boundless Sea, to return to his homeland.</p><p>But for some reason, Elder Qing Zhu didn't leave, returned to Turtle Island, and was found by his enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head, his mind a jumble.  He organized the timeline based on the information he had.</p><p>The last time the Violet Palace opened, about three hundred years ago, Qing Zhu provoked a powerful enemy there, barely escaping with his life, and fled to the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Then, over two hundred years ago, Qing Zhu concealed his identity and came to the remote Turtle Island, where he remained to cultivate.</p><p>Now it seemed likely he was hiding from his enemy, which explained why Qin Sang had searched for so long without finding any trace of him.</p><p>Over the years, Qing Zhu often held lectures, guiding rogue cultivators, but never accepted disciples.  Qin Sang was certain that during this period, Qing Zhu never missed a single opening of the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Fifty years ago, when the Seven Kills Hall appeared on its own and the Violet Palace opened again, Qing Zhu sealed the island.</p><p>Two years ago, Turtle Island was attacked, and Qing Zhu's fate remained unknown.  It was unclear when he left the sword marks, the jade slip, and the sorrowful message in the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>The timeline aligned. It was almost certain that the Island Lord of Turtle Island was Elder Qing Zhu.</p><p>His movements were mostly clear, but many questions remained.</p><p>Who was Elder Qing Zhu's enemy, the one he feared so much?</p><p>Why didn't he leave?  Was there a problem with the teleportation formation?</p><p>"After the Elder sealed the island, countless people visited, but were all turned away. Even if Fellow Daoist Qin had come two years earlier, you wouldn't have seen the Elder... Fellow Daoist Qin... Fellow Daoist Qin..."</p><p>Sect Leader Wu noticed Qin Sang's silence and asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, his voice tinged with disappointment. "It's nothing.  As rogue cultivators, our path is arduous.  I thought I had finally found a master, only to be disappointed again."</p><p>Sect Leader Wu empathized. "Though the Elder is gone, his legacy remains. I have a few friends who listened to his lectures with me. We follow his teachings and often gather to discuss the Dao, sharing our knowledge freely. Since Fellow Daoist Qin saved my entire sect, if you don't mind, I can introduce you."</p><p>"Thank you, but I admire the Elder's demeanor and wish to visit Palm Island and Turtle Island first. I will visit you another time."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed and continued to ask Sect Leader Wu about the past.</p><p>Sect Leader Wu, unsuspecting, seeing Qin Sang's curiosity about the Island Lord of Turtle Island, didn't hold back, recounting his past experiences in detail.</p><p>As they talked, they felt the wooden boat's rocking lessen.</p><p>A disciple came down, excitedly announcing that the storm had stopped.</p><p>Sect Leader Wu's injuries had improved somewhat, and the two of them emerged from the cabin.  Outside, the wind and waves had calmed, but a thick fog enveloped them.  The lone boat drifted, surrounded by water, its location unknown.</p><p>Sect Leader Wu and his disciples worked to determine their position.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, head southeast to reach Palm Island. The heavy fog is a time for sea monsters to stir up trouble, so be careful. Fortunately, this isn't like the southern part of the archipelago; the fog will clear soon."</p><p>Sect Leader Wu wanted to accompany Qin Sang, but Qin Sang declined, accepting the directions instead.</p>
