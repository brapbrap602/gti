<h1>Chapter 1573: The Moonlit Seal</h1><p>‘Crack crack crack…’</p><p>The sound of cracking ice echoed through the ice cave.</p><p>The pink lightning failed to penetrate the energy shield, instead splitting into countless threads that snaked towards Qin Sang’s feet, seeping into the ice.</p><p>The lightning possessed a terrifying corrosive power.</p><p>A large hole was instantly corroded beneath Qin Sang.  Wherever the stray threads touched, the ice silently dissolved, the effect spreading far and wide.  A large section of the ice cave collapsed.</p><p>The ice cave was a place where chilling煞 energy gathered.  The glacial ice here contained this energy.  This ambient煞 energy differed from that within the ice crystals. Qin Sang surmised that the煞 energy within the crystals had been transformed by a spirit array, making it directly refinable by cultivators.</p><p>However, even the impure煞 energy within the ice, which formed the glacial ice, was far harder than ordinary ice.  If struck by the pink lightning, the consequences would be unthinkable.</p><p>This woman's attack was so ruthless, aiming to kill them outright. How could Qin Sang and Yan Shan Old Man not be enraged?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Yan Shan Old Man.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had specifically asked about the presence of any major forces near the snowfield.  Yan Shan Old Man had confidently replied that there were none.</p><p>In pursuit of the snow fox, Yan Shan Old Man had repeatedly entered and exited the snowfield, thoroughly investigating it. No matter how much commotion they caused in the snowfield, no one would arrive for quite some time.</p><p>Therefore, they had felt safe breaking through the ice and pursuing the snow fox.</p><p>Yet now, a stranger appeared, a woman of extremely high cultivation, also at the mid-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally labelled her a "妖女" (demoness), not just out of anger.  Even with her ruthless actions, Qin Sang had to admit that her every glance and smile were alluring, a natural charm, not some practiced technique; a captivating beauty capable of toppling nations.</p><p>“Humph!  You escaped quickly!”</p><p>Yue Fei, her attack having missed, let out a cold laugh. She darted to a corner of the ice cave and stood still, seemingly guarding against Qin Sang and Yan Shan Old Man's counterattack.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to ask Yan Shan Old Man about the woman's identity, he noticed something unusual and felt a sudden foreboding.  He quickly unleashed his Stepping Snow Divine Blade.</p><p>The blade energy surged towards the empty space next to the ice crystal pillar.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>The ice beneath the surface bulged slightly, and an ice pillar sprouted from it, an exact replica of Yue Fei.</p><p>The ice sculpture's eyelashes fluttered, and the ice transformed into flesh and blood. Yue Fei, using some unknown secret technique, approached the ice crystal before their very eyes.</p><p>Ignoring the blade energy behind her, Yue Fei reached for the ice pillar, a pearl hidden in her palm.</p><p>The pink lightning emanated from this pearl.</p><p>A crackling sound erupted.</p><p>Yue Fei concentrated the countless tiny threads of lightning within her hand, aiming them at the ice pillar in an attempt to shatter it and take the ice crystal within.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the lightning struck the pillar without leaving a mark.</p><p>Yue Fei froze, then noticed that the spirit array beneath her glowed brightly. A blue beam shot from inside the ice pillar, like a sharp sword, directly towards her face.</p><p>With the ice sword in front and the divine blade behind, Yue Fei’s expression shifted wildly.  Realizing she couldn't forcibly take the ice crystal, she remained calm in the face of danger and flung her light gauze, transforming it into a colorful cloud—a defensive treasure used to simultaneously deflect both attacks.</p><p>‘Puff! Puff!’</p><p>The ice sword and Stepping Snow Divine Blade struck successively.</p><p>The cloud first entangled with the ice sword.  Just as the cloud began to compress the sword, the closely following Stepping Snow Divine Blade struck its weak point.</p><p>The light gauze couldn't hold, the cloud collapsing with a bang.  Countless fragments of gauze fluttered to the ground, a fine defensive treasure destroyed.</p><p>Yue Fei retreated, escaping at the cost of a treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang watched clearly, realizing that the demoness’s primary cultivation path was, like the ice sculpture, the way of ice, explaining her covetousness of the ice crystal.</p><p>“So it's a mere thief!”</p><p>Yan Shan Old Man, who hadn't had a chance to act, had been startled when he saw Yue Fei approaching the ice crystal.  Fortunately, the ice pillar was protected by a restriction.</p><p>The opponent clearly didn't understand the restrictions.</p><p>Startled and then furious, Yan Shan Old Man immediately flung a thin rope towards Yue Fei’s brow.</p><p>Qin Sang was also enraged.  The demoness wasn’t the owner of the place and yet dared to attack first—truly reckless!</p><p>“Demoness, who are you? State your name!” Yan Shan Old Man roared.</p><p>The thin rope, flexible as a snake, seemingly aimed for Yue Fei's brow, but when Yue Fei attempted to defend, its attack changed, emitting circular ripples.</p><p>These ripples contained a binding power, used previously by Yan Shan Old Man when capturing the snow fox.</p><p>The woman, Yuefei, ignored the old man, Yanshan, her gaze fixed on the ice crystal, clearly unconvinced.  She only withdrew her gaze when she sensed an approaching attack, quickly removing a silver bracelet from her wrist and flicking it. The bracelet vibrated, shattering the incoming wave and protecting a thin wire, engaging in a fierce struggle.</p><p>Yanshan, abandoning his initial disdain, said, “This woman possesses considerable treasures; she must be someone important. I wonder if she has accomplices.  Fellow Daoist, act quickly!”</p><p>Qin Sang, however, didn’t follow Yanshan’s instructions.  He said gravely, “Fellow Daoist, you should be able to hold her off, right? I believe I have some skill in array formations, and my unique eye technique is useful for breaking them. Please buy me some time, Daoist. We’ll split the ice crystal afterward.”</p><p>Qin Sang observed Yanshan as he spoke.  Having just found the ice crystal, a mysterious woman appeared. Was it merely coincidence?  He began to suspect Yanshan as well.  Obtaining the crystal was his priority. He could deal with the woman later.  His main body was outside and could detect the approach of any strong cultivators, so he wasn’t worried about that for now.</p><p>Yanshan paused, exchanging a look with Qin Sang before nodding. “Very well! As you say, Daoist! My abilities are limited; I fear I might not be able to defeat her. Daoist, please don't hold back!”</p><p>With that, Yanshan sprang forward, closing the distance to Yuefei. He wielded his three-headed dragon shield as a weapon.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The three-headed dragon shield transformed into three streaks of dark light, whirling around Yuefei in a dazzling display.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if he was overthinking things. Dismissing his doubts, he moved to the ice pillar, working with the Celestial Eye Butterfly to decipher the formation on the ice surface.</p><p>Initially, the dense runes made him dizzy. But soon, he made a surprising discovery. The array’s creator possessed exceptional skill in ice-type formations; the array incorporated chilling煞 energy.  Having refined an ice crystal before his transformation, he could exploit this point to break the array.</p><p>Both Yanshan and the woman were mid-Yuan Ying stage cultivators. Even if he couldn't defeat the woman, holding her off shouldn't be a problem.  Of course, Qin Sang remained vigilant against unforeseen events.</p><p>Gradually, he found a solution. He held out his hand, shrinking the Snow-Treading Divine Blade to the size of a dagger, its energy contained.  He placed it on the ground and began carving into the array.</p><p>Where his blade passed, white marks appeared, the blade energy condensing into runes, severing the connections within the array. Qin Sang worked quickly, pausing only occasionally to think.  He was close to breaking the array.</p><p>Suddenly, a gasp startled him. Looking over, he saw that the two had stopped fighting. Yanshan stared at Yuefei's forehead, his expression shocked.  “The Dark Moon Seal! You're a Dark Moon Guard from Luye?”</p><p>Yanshan’s previous attack with the thin wire on Yuefei’s forehead had forced out a blood-red moon mark.</p><p>Dark Moon Seal.</p><p>Luye.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyelids twitched.  Which Luye?</p><p>Following Yanshan’s gaze, Qin Sang also saw the blood-red moon on the woman's forehead.  Yanshan’s voice echoed in his mind:</p><p>“The cultivation world uses two marks to identify Luye’s demonic cultivators: the Dragon-Slaying Demon Skill, and the Dark Moon Seal on their foreheads, identifying them as Dark Moon Guards. However, the Demon Lord Lu has vanished for centuries, and the Dark Moon Guards have rarely appeared.  I remember there were fewer and fewer of them…”</p><p>Qin Sang understood, but his heart grew tense.  The woman was incredibly influential!</p><p>It was incredibly coincidental that a Dark Moon Guard appeared upon entering the ice cave.  Could the legendary Luye be nearby?  Even more terrifying, the cave’s array and ice crystal could have been created by the Demon Lord Lu himself!</p><p>Qin Sang's transformed body and main body were both present, but he didn't dare to challenge a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Yuefei scoffed, “Knowing my identity, and you still don't scram!”</p><p>Yanshan's face paled, then reddened. Suddenly remembering something, the shock on his face subsided, replaced by a cold smile.  “Outsiders fear the Demon Lord Lu, not you Dark Moon Guards!  You’re nothing but expendable blood slaves, yet you dare call yourself ‘this concubine’! The Demon Lord Lu never associates with women, and centuries ago, he went to a meeting in the Central Plains with a Nascent Soul cultivator from the righteous path, then disappeared.  Legend says the Eight Scenic Spots and the Ganlu Temple hold secrets of ascension. Whenever a Nascent Soul cultivator appears from outside, they're invited to the Central Plains. Most, like the Demon Lord Lu, vanish afterward, rumored to have ascended.  The Demon Lord hasn't been seen for centuries.  Even if he hasn't ascended, he must be in seclusion, preparing for it…”</p><p>The seductive smile on Yuefei’s lips faded.</p><p>Yan Shan, animated by the conversation, looked at the moon princess with a disdainful glance and scoffed, "After Lu Lao Mo achieved transcendence, the Moon Seal would become a full moon. The one you possess couldn't possibly be his work! Lu Lao Mo has a foster son, rumored to be a womanizer who collects beauties. Considering your cultivation and appearance, you must be one of his favorites. Yet, even the Moon Seal won't release you.  Heheh... ultimately, you're just a plaything!"</p><p>Qin Sang was still processing Yan Shan's words.</p><p>No cultivator would forsake the desire for ascension, but Yan Shan's use of 'ascension' was clearly different from that of antiquity.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi had an eight-character maxim—"Transcendence achieved, destination known."</p><p>Qin Sang had been pondering this maxim, inquiring about transcendent cultivators in Central Plains after arriving, but only found vague legends.</p><p>Transcendent cultivators were elusive, seemingly vanishing without a trace, none reported to have perished from tribulation or natural causes.</p><p>"When you reach the mountain, the road will appear.”</p><p>With Xiao Xiangzi's maxim and these findings, Qin Sang ceased worrying about the path after transcendence, focusing solely on improving her cultivation and strength.</p><p>Was the place of ascension the same as the 'destination' in the maxim?</p><p>Transcendence was possible, and the Eight Views and Ganlu Temple knew its secret.</p><p>Apparently, the Eight Views and Ganlu Temple's dominance wasn't simply due to their frequent production of transcendent cultivators.</p><p>Yan Shan knew so many secrets.</p><p>Who was this person?</p><p>Qin Sang had assumed Yan Shan was a reclusive cultivator.</p><p>Rumor placed Lu Ye in the Northern Wastelands, where Yan Shan also resided, so knowing about Lu Lao Mo's foster son was reasonable, but the other secrets seemed beyond the reach of a recluse.</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>An angry roar cut through Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>The moon princess, stung by Yan Shan's words, flew into a rage.  With a sweep of her hand, pink pearls shot towards Yan Shan's head.</p><p>"Crackle!"</p><p>A thunderclap erupted.</p><p>The pearls unleashed streaks of lightning, weaving into a net in mid-air, engulfing him.</p><p>The alluringly beautiful woman's attacks grew fiercer with each strike.</p><p>Yan Shan reacted swiftly, his fingers pointing at his shield.</p><p>With a whoosh, three dragon-head shields flew up, their tails connecting to form a unique triangular shield.  Three dragon mouths simultaneously spewed water, forming a thick barrier.</p><p>"Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!"</p><p>The lightning net pierced the barrier.</p><p>The barrier instantly turned pink, resisting for a moment before being corroded away.</p><p>Seeing the danger, Yan Shan changed his hand seals.</p><p>The dragon-head shields expanded, shielding him completely, taking the net's brunt.</p><p>A loud "bang" echoed.</p><p>The dragon-head shield trembled.</p><p>The moon princess continued her relentless assault, pearls spewing lightning, the light like a torrential rain, hammering the shield.</p><p>Simultaneously, the moon princess subtly moved her fingers.</p><p>The ice beneath Yan Shan shattered explosively, a dragon's roar erupting from below, an ice dragon bursting from the fragments.</p><p>The ice dragon was long, its entire body composed of ice; its horns, claws, and scales were identical to those of legendary dragons, exuding power and vitality, like a living creature.</p><p>The ice dragon opened its jaws, aiming for Yan Shan's legs.</p><p>The moon princess's attacks were lethal.</p><p>Yan Shan's expression changed, his palm shifting; a silver droplet fell from his hand, exploding below him into a silver mist.</p><p>The light mist, however, was heavy as a mountain. The ice dragon crashed into it, a metallic clang echoing as its momentum sharply decreased.</p><p>Yan Shan seized the opportunity to evade the attack.</p><p>Yan Shan’s words enraged the woman. Though prepared, he was still startled and urgently transmitted, "That woman's not acting on Lu Lao Mo's orders, don't let her deceive you! The Moon Guards are Lu Lao Mo's slaves; countless have died, yet he never avenged them.  But the Moon Guards have many strong warriors; if this drags on, she might summon reinforcements, further complicating matters. Quickly retrieve the Ice Crystal and leave!"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>It had come to this; there was no turning back.</p><p>Yan Shan’s words were sound. As long as Lu Lao Mo didn’t intervene, Qin Sang had nothing to fear from the so-called foster son or the Moon Guards.</p><p>The woman clearly coveted the Ice Crystal.</p><p>Quickly obtain the crystal and leave; would Lu Lao Mo intervene for his foster son's consort?</p><p>It was highly unlikely.</p><p>There were ostensibly only four transcendent cultivators in Central Plains.</p><p>Master Dan Yu, Sage Hui Guang, and the Yaozu Saint King had all vanished.</p><p>Lu Lao Mo disappeared even earlier.  Was he truly unique, capable of remaining aloof?</p>
