<h1>Chapter 2008: Guest Elder</h1><p>Cloud pavilions stood in rows, the foremost bearing a wooden plaque inscribed with the three characters ‘Five Elements Alliance.’  Unremarkable, the plaque was made of the most common spiritwood, offering no hint of pressure to deter potential guests.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously passed by the Heavenly Axis Pavilion, a stark contrast to the Five Elements Alliance's style.</p><p>Ascending to the twentieth heaven, he observed a constant stream of guests before the Five Elements Alliance, a testament to its reputation.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped into the Alliance, and a servant girl with a bright smile immediately approached.</p><p>However, before she could speak, a young man hurried over, clearing his throat and saying, “You may leave. I will attend to this Senior.”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t bothered to conceal his aura.</p><p>Even in White Jade Capital, Void Refinement cultivators were not commonplace, while Unity and Grand Completion stage masters were even more elusive.</p><p>“Yes!” The servant girl didn’t hesitate, bowing slightly and gracefully stepping aside, her smile unwavering as she turned to greet another guest.</p><p>“Senior, please.”</p><p>The young man personally led the way, guiding Qin Sang to a quiet room and ordering fragrant tea and spirit fruits to be served, demonstrating impeccable courtesy.</p><p>“May I inquire as to Senior’s Daoist title?” the young man asked respectfully.</p><p>“This humble Daoist’s surname is Qin, and my given name is Sang,” Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Despite intending to use the Five Elements Alliance as a cover, Qin Sang decided to use his real name.</p><p>If his identity were exposed during the retrieval of the sword, forcing him to flee, true names and aliases would become irrelevant.  The name ‘Qin Sang’ might even spread throughout the world, reaching the ears of old acquaintances.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Qin,” the young man bowed slightly. “May I ask what your needs are? The Five Elements Alliance will do its utmost to satisfy them. Even if this branch is unable to, our headquarters is on the thirtieth heaven, and this junior will immediately request assistance from the elders there.”</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance not only dealt in refining tools but also had branches throughout the Eight Great Celestial Provinces, gathering spirit materials from all corners of the world. It could be said that any spirit material for refining, if not found in the Five Elements Alliance, was unlikely to be found in any other merchant house.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t immediately reveal his true intentions, instead producing a jade slip. “Does your esteemed establishment possess these spirit materials?”</p><p>The young man accepted it, his divine sense sweeping over its contents. He nodded, “We do have them. May I ask how much Senior Qin requires? Also, some of these spirit materials are generally not for sale. I hope Senior will understand.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. “Generally? Which specific materials are you referring to?”</p><p>The spirit materials listed in the jade slip included some he genuinely needed, others added as a smokescreen, and some required for constructing the Dao Gate altar.</p><p>The young man pointed them out one by one, including the Azure Mark Primordial Essence.  Qin Sang couldn’t help but feel grateful for the large amount he had acquired in the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven.</p><p>“Since your establishment possesses these materials, why not sell them to me? Are you concerned that I cannot afford the price?”</p><p>Qin Sang feigned displeasure, letting out a cold snort.</p><p>“Senior, please calm your anger,” the young man bowed deeply, neither servile nor overbearing. “This is a rule established by the elders of our Alliance, and this junior has no authority to change it. If Senior Qin urgently requires these materials, this junior will immediately invite Elder Qi. Perhaps he can make an exception.”</p><p>Qin Sang gave a faint hum. “Go then.”</p><p>“This junior will take his leave!”</p><p>The young man hastily retreated, and not long after, the restriction outside the door was triggered.</p><p>Qin Sang straightened, his voice deep. “Enter.”</p><p>An elderly man with a ruddy complexion pushed open the door, a smile on his face and a relaxed demeanor.</p><p>“Qi Mu greets Fellow Daoist Qin. If the junior was remiss earlier, I hope Fellow Daoist Qin will forgive him.”</p><p>Alliances like the Five Elements Alliance, while valuing refining skills, also placed great importance on cultivation level. This Elder Qi’s cultivation was similar to his own. It seemed that Void Refinement cultivators could become elders in the Five Elements Alliance, though he didn't know how high the ‘elder’ rank truly was.</p><p>Qin Sang turned these thoughts over in his mind, rising to return the greeting. “Elder Qi is too kind. Steward Zhao, due to his limited authority, was unable to meet my requirements, so I had to disturb your peace.”</p><p>“I am already aware of the situation and have come to explain to Fellow Daoist,” Elder Qi gestured for Qin Sang to take a seat opposite him. “It’s not that we are deliberately targeting Fellow Daoist, but our Alliance does have this rule. Fellow Daoist is certainly aware of the value of those spirit materials. Firstly, they are indeed rare, and our Alliance has taken considerable effort to collect them. Secondly, their quantity is limited, and they are prioritized for our Alliance’s refining Grandmasters for self-sufficiency, and to satisfy certain guests we cannot afford to offend. Only then can we consider others. Due to our Alliance’s reputation, we cannot simply say we don't have them; others wouldn't believe us.  We are simply left with the tedious task of explaining.”</p><p>Elder Qi’s words, accompanied by a wry smile, were frank and open.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this, but he also didn’t believe the Five Elements Alliance truly wouldn’t sell. In business, it was simply a matter of the price not being high enough.</p><p>Transactions at this level certainly required bartering. As long as Qin Sang offered spirit materials of higher value, the Five Elements Alliance would undoubtedly be interested.</p><p>The problem was, with Qin Sang's current resources, he couldn't sustain such significantly inflated transactions for long. It wasn’t a long-term solution.</p><p>‘Tap, tap…’</p><p>Qin Sang’s fingers lightly tapped the table. “Fellow Daoist Qi’s meaning is, as long as one becomes an insider, everything is negotiable?”</p><p>Elder Qi was slightly taken aback, scrutinizing Qin Sang carefully before speaking in a serious tone. “If Fellow Daoist joins the Five Elements Alliance, naturally, you will enjoy numerous benefits. However…”</p><p>“However what? Does your esteemed Alliance only accept Refining Grandmasters?” Qin Sang countered with a smile.</p><p>“Of course not. With Fellow Daoist’s cultivation, our Alliance would be more than happy to welcome you. However, firstly, while enjoying the benefits, you must also contribute to the Alliance. Can Fellow Daoist accept this? Secondly, the Dao of Refining is the foundation of our Alliance, and our internal structure inherently values Refining Grandmasters more. This must be clarified in advance to avoid any resentment in the future,” Elder Qi explained frankly.</p><p>Void Refinement rogue cultivators were uncommon, but not unheard of. However, could such untamed individuals truly settle down within an organization?</p><p>Moreover, in White Jade Capital, there were many better options than the Five Elements Alliance.</p><p>Elder Qi believed it unlikely that Qin Sang would join the Five Elements Alliance merely for a few spirit materials.</p><p>Seeing Elder Qi’s attitude, Qin Sang guessed his thoughts and stopped probing, saying truthfully, “To be honest, I have also immersed myself in the Dao of Refining for many years, and I have personally refined a few spirit treasures.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Elder Qi’s expression immediately changed.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin truly keeps his abilities hidden. It seems this Qi has poor judgment,” Elder Qi’s gaze was noticeably more enthusiastic than before.</p><p>“Forgive my presumption, but has Fellow Daoist previously joined any other refining factions, such as the Heavenly Axis Pavilion?”  Elder Qi first inquired about Qin Sang’s background, then quickly added, lest Qin Sang misunderstand, “Our Alliance, being an alliance in name, has many fellow Daoists with multiple affiliations, including sect masters. However, disputes are inevitable between major factions, so we need to clarify this in advance, so that we can arrange for Fellow Daoist to avoid conflicts of interest, lest it become difficult for you.”</p><p>“I am accustomed to acting alone.  I've only heard of your esteemed Alliance's lax restrictions, which prompted this visit. I haven't yet been to the Heavenly Axis Pavilion,” Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Elder Qi's eyes grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>A Void Refinement Refining Grandmaster who also acted alone was truly rare. Recommending such a person to the Alliance would be a great merit for him.</p><p>Could it be that he had just ascended from a Small Thousand World? That would be marvelous! Such individuals were like blank slates in the Great Thousand World, each possessing exceptional talent and boundless potential. They must be retained at all costs!</p><p>He didn't worry about Qin Sang being a spy sent by another faction with malicious intent. Time would reveal a person's true nature. Due to the Five Elements Alliance's loose structure, "spies" were numerous, and they had ample experience dealing with such individuals.</p><p>Elder Qi said seriously, “Fellow Daoist Qin has come to the right place.  Throughout the Great Zhou, there is no faction more suitable for Fellow Daoist than our Alliance. Joining our Alliance will not only grant you access to the benefits within but also various advantages outside.”</p><p>“Oh?  What advantages are there?” Qin Sang became interested.</p><p>“For example, the Nine Teleportation Formations between the various Celestial Provinces and White Jade Capital, each use of which incurs a considerable cost.  Fellow Daoist, upon joining our Alliance, will not only enjoy discounts but also be able to bring two disciples each time…” The examples Elder Qi gave sounded mundane, but they were tangible benefits.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh inwardly. He had long speculated about who controlled the Nine Teleportation Formations.</p><p>The Nine Teleportation Formations were akin to the lifeblood of the human race. Given that the Zhou King couldn't even determine his own lifespan, all parties would certainly not tolerate him controlling the Nine Teleportation Formations.</p><p>Now it seemed that the human race's sects, clans, and top factions likely all had a hand in it, each taking a share of the profits.</p><p>The continued existence of the Great Zhou indicated overall stability within the human race. In this situation, various parties checked and balanced each other while also seeking allies and mutual benefits. Aligning with a particular faction offered access to other conveniences, clearly outweighing the disadvantages.</p><p>"Are these all benefits enjoyed by Guest Elders?" Qin Sang mused.</p><p>“Indeed! If Fellow Daoist Qin truly becomes a member of the Five Elements Alliance, our Alliance would be delighted to welcome you,” Elder Qi said enthusiastically.</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance may have started as a simple alliance, but after years of development, its structure had changed. The Alliance cultivated its own forces, with core members mostly raised within the Five Elements Alliance from a young age.</p><p>Others wishing to join had to undergo more rigorous trials.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal. “Enjoying so many benefits must also come with obligations, right?”</p><p>“Indeed.  Our Alliance has branches throughout the Eight Great Celestial Provinces, and we have a constant stream of guests requesting our refining services. Some commissions can only be completed by Refining Grandmasters. Our Alliance understands that cultivation takes precedence, but every so often, one must complete a commission to give the Alliance an account of their efforts,” Elder Qi didn't explicitly state what was required to truly join the Five Elements Alliance.</p><p>Both of them understood that it entailed greater restrictions, which Qin Sang couldn't tolerate, at least not in the short term. He wouldn’t consider joining a faction for now; being a Guest Elder was sufficient.</p><p>There was plenty of time for the future.  Elder Qi, not rushing the recruitment, nodded and said, “Could Fellow Daoist demonstrate your skill in the Dao of Refining to me?  This way, I can report to the higher-ups.”</p><p>“How can I prove it?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Any method will do. I only need initial confirmation. The Alliance will have procedures for the next steps,” Elder Qi said.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment, his mind stirring.</p><p>A chill swept through the quiet room, suddenly illuminated by sword light. A sword, like autumn frost, appeared between the two, the Grey Warbler Sword!</p><p>“This sword was refined in imitation of my lifebound spirit sword and is connected to my mind and spirit. I ask Elder Qi to appraise it.”</p><p>Qin Sang presented the sword.</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword hummed and vibrated, as if echoing its master's words, yet also seemingly unwilling to be judged.  The sword’s humming was filled with pride, overflowing with spiritual nature.</p><p>“A fine sword!”</p><p>Elder Qi exclaimed in admiration. Based on his years of experience, he could tell at a glance that this sword was undoubtedly crafted by Qin Sang himself, bearing distinct differences from spirit treasures refined by others.</p><p>“This spirit sword is sufficient proof of Fellow Daoist Qin’s skill,” Elder Qi rose and solemnly returned the Grey Warbler Sword to Qin Sang. “Please wait a moment while I report to the Alliance.”</p><p>“Please, Fellow Daoist,” Qin Sang saw Elder Qi off, pondering his next move.</p><p>As a precaution, Qin Sang had to consider his future path, which might involve relying on the Dao Gate altar to continue comprehending the Grand Completion Killing Dao.</p><p>If his identity were exposed, there would be no opportunity to gather spirit materials while on the run.  He could only do as much as possible now.</p><p>Unfortunately, the spirit materials required for the Dao Gate altar were too numerous.  Even with the help of the Five Elements Alliance, it would be difficult to gather them all.  He would likely still need the assistance of the Sword Slaves in the future.</p><p>Lost in thought, Elder Qi returned.</p><p>While waiting for the Five Elements Alliance's response, Qin Sang chatted with Elder Qi.</p><p>Knowing little about the Great Thousand World, Qin Sang was concerned about revealing his ignorance, so he mainly discussed the Dao of Refining with Elder Qi.</p><p>White Jade Capital was the center of the human race in the Great Thousand World, where information on various Dao lineages circulated.  Even if Elder Qi hadn't witnessed them personally, his knowledge far surpassed Qin Sang's.</p><p>After their exchange, Qin Sang could only marvel at the profound and intricate nature of the Great Thousand World's Dao of Refining. There were many refining methods he had never heard of, each incredibly mysterious.</p><p>“I’ve heard of a secret technique involving transferring one’s soul into a tool, transforming into a spirit race and gaining a new life. Is this true?” Qin Sang asked casually.</p><p>“There are legends of such a secret technique, but those who claim to know it are all charlatans, preying on the desperate.  Their actions are despicable,” Elder Qi said with disdain.  “Even if such a heaven-defying, life-altering secret technique truly exists in the world, only those unparalleled great powers would have the ability to perform it.”</p><p>He wondered if the Five Elements Alliance had such great powers.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't ask this question. Even if there were great powers proficient in this technique, he lacked the ability to request their assistance. Moreover, the matter of the Cloud Roaming Sword was too sensitive to expose.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang learned from Elder Qi that within the Five Elements Alliance, contributions could be made through other means besides refining for guests.  The greater the contribution, the greater the rewards, such as voluntarily offering treasures.</p><p>This wasn’t a secret, and Elder Qi directly handed Qin Sang a jade slip.</p><p>His divine sense probed the jade slip, and the countless names within were dazzling and exhilarating.</p><p>There were so many heavenly and earthly treasures that Qin Sang had never heard of. Some only existed in legends, or were mentioned briefly in ancient texts, having vanished long ago.  Even the Five Elements Alliance wasn’t certain of their existence.</p><p>The Ten Great Spiritwoods were listed, and Qin Sang made a strange discovery.</p><p>Among the Ten Great Spiritwoods, the Interminable Blood Mulberry was ranked first, even higher than the Soul Nourishing Wood.</p><p>“It’s said that the Interminable Blood Mulberry’s Blood Defilement Divine Light can taint magical treasures.  Wouldn't its power against spirit treasures be greatly diminished?  Why is it so highly valued?” Qin Sang pointed to the Interminable Blood Mulberry and asked.</p><p>This question further convinced Elder Qi that Qin Sang didn’t hail from a major refining faction.  “Fellow Daoist is unaware. It’s said that the Blood Defilement Divine Light, when refined through a special secret technique, can mask the spiritual nature of spirit treasures.  Daily refinement makes them easier to subdue and also has a certain effect on tool spirits. It can be said to be the most convenient secret technique for taming tool spirits in the world.”</p>
