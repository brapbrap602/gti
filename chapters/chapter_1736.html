<h1>Chapter 1727: Journey East</h1><p>Great Compassion Temple branch monastery.</p><p>This monastery, built in a remote area near the storm belt, is dedicated to protecting a sacred site and serves as a tribulation ground for the Great Compassion Temple's high monks throughout history.</p><p>Outside the temple, yellow sand swirls.</p><p>On this day,</p><p>two figures approach from the desert depths; one in monk's robes, the other in Taoist attire.</p><p>Their movements suggest they aren't flying, but rather walking at an incredible speed, their feet seemingly never touching the ground.  To an ordinary person, they might appear as apparitions.</p><p>The two are Qin Sang and Master Huaiyin.</p><p>Master Huaiyin leads the way.</p><p>Qin Sang follows closely, eyes closed, a faint golden glow emanating from his body. His blood surges, indicating he's struggling to suppress something.</p><p>Three years of training in the Radiant Gold Sword Grotto have left Qin Sang infused with the grotto's energy.</p><p>A Nascent Divinity cultivator who once rebuilt himself through the ordeal of a Yin Fire tribulation, he endures pain beyond what is humanly possible.  He didn’t just passively absorb the Radiant Gold energy; once acclimated, he actively channeled his true essence to draw in more. To achieve peak results, he pushed his physical limits constantly, experiencing unimaginable suffering and refining his body and spirit.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, who occasionally checked on his progress in the Grotto, praised his dedication.</p><p>The benefits of training in the Radiant Gold Sword Grotto aren't immediately apparent. Over time, the Radiant Gold energy accumulates within the body, requiring time to refine.</p><p>This refining process strengthens the physical body, a benefit Qin Sang will realize in his future cultivation.</p><p>His intense training is aimed at absorbing as much Radiant Gold energy as possible. Three years of arduous practice have nearly reached his physical limits; the accumulated energy is the source of his surging blood.</p><p>Qin Sang utilizes his true essence to calm it.</p><p>He examines his inner self.</p><p>His true essence circulates ceaselessly.</p><p>With each complete cycle, his blood calms a little more.</p><p>By the time they reach the Great Compassion Temple branch monastery, Qin Sang has regained his composure, appearing once again as an ethereal Taoist.</p><p>The monastery only houses a few monks—all high-ranking members of the Great Compassion Temple who arrived early to safeguard Master Zhitang.</p><p>Upon entering the temple, they don't find Master Zhitang; he's not due to emerge from seclusion for three days and intends to attempt a breakthrough upon his exit.</p><p>Master Huaiyin leads Qin Sang to a quiet room, leaves for the time it takes to burn an incense stick, and returns with a scroll for Qin Sang.</p><p>It’s a thin scroll, soft to the touch.</p><p>It's the Great Compassion Temple's tribulation treasure—the Ming Wang scroll!</p><p>Qin Sang slowly unfolds the scroll, discovering it's made of a material similar to the finest silk, thin as a cicada's wing, with a slightly yellowed background, yet the colors remain vibrant.</p><p>The Ming Wang scroll depicts one of the legendary manifestations of the Immovable Ming Wang.</p><p>The figure sits on a stone pedestal, appearing as a child. It has seven topknots, hair cascading down its left shoulder, its left eye closed, its lower teeth biting its upper lip, a face of wrath, a raging fire on its back, a sharp sword in its right hand, and a vajra in its left, a gesture to sever afflictions.</p><p>The painted figure is lifelike, possessing the aura of a true Ming Wang, daunting to behold; evil spirits would flee at its mere sight.</p><p>Master Huaiyin folds his hands, kneeling before the Ming Wang image, chanting softly.</p><p>He isn't reciting ordinary scriptures, but the incantations to activate the Ming Wang scroll—utterly profound.</p><p>Though not a Buddhist devotee, Qin Sang—whose true body once studied Buddhism in the Western Desert and whose avatar spent time in the Ganlu Temple scripture hall—finds the incantations' workings understandable.</p><p>Understanding the incantation makes use straightforward.  Qin Sang simply needs to fully activate the Ming Wang scroll, unleashing the image’s extraordinary power, and at the opportune moment, bestow it upon Master Zhitang. Three days are ample time to master this treasure.</p><p>He carefully memorizes the incantations, delves into the scroll with his spiritual sense, and dedicates himself to its understanding.</p><p>Master Huaiyin quietly withdraws.</p><p>Qin Sang remains in the quiet room for three days.</p><p>On the second day, Master Xingji visits but doesn't disturb him.</p><p>Until the dawn of the day Master Zhitang emerges from seclusion.</p><p>Monks stand guard before Qin Sang’s room.  A creak—Qin Sang exits. He nods to Master Xingji, then says to Master Huaiyin, “I can now skillfully wield the Ming Wang scroll. Where does Master Zhitang intend to undergo his tribulation?”</p><p>Master Huaiyin bows.  “Please, True Monarch, to the back mountain.”</p><p>The so-called back mountain was once a sand dune, later solidified into a mountain by the Great Compassion Temple's high monks using their great powers; several generations of monks have since channeled moisture, artificially creating a green mountain.</p><p>The back mountain isn't large, containing only three peaks.</p><p>The monks and Qin Sang reach the summit of the leftmost peak and gaze towards the central peak.</p><p>Upon arrival, Qin Sang senses something amiss and says gravely, “Master Zhitang has begun his breakthrough.”</p><p>Master Huaiyin and the others were unaware of the impending event.  Upon hearing the news, their expressions tightened, and they anxiously watched the main peak.</p><p>The failed attempt meant everything was off the table. Qin Sang had gained an advantage without lifting a finger.</p><p>Since the fall of Master Zilei, less than two hundred years had passed. In both the Western and Central lands, aside from Qin Sang, no one else had successfully broken through to the next realm and drawn down the divine tribulation, at least not publicly.</p><p>Master Zilei was unaware of the Heavenly Demon Sound, and his hasty tribulation attempt ended poorly.  This time, Master Zhitang had made extensive preparations and even invited a protector for the tribulation. If he succeeded, drawing down the Heavenly Tribulation, they could finally verify the power of the Heavenly Demon Sound.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>At midday, the sky suddenly darkened.</p><p>A violent wind swept across the void.</p><p>Sandstorms arose outside the mountain, and yellow sand enveloped the temple, obscuring the sun and causing darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others stared intently at the main peak. Above the peak, wind and clouds gathered, and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth surged, forming a visible vortex of spiritual energy hanging in the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised. Judging by the scene, Master Zhitang's attempt had a good chance of success. His extreme patience in accumulating power for this tribulation was truly extraordinary.</p><p>Success in breaking through didn't guarantee transcendence. Even before the Heavenly Demon Sound appeared, countless strong cultivators had perished during the tribulation. Not everyone could pass the wind tribulation and the mental tribulation as easily as Qin Sang.</p><p>However, those who reached this stage were all exceptionally talented individuals!</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, sitting cross-legged on a rock with the Ming Wang scroll laid across his knees.</p><p>Seeing his action, Master Xingji led several monks to another peak, while Master Huaiyin remained beside Qin Sang.</p><p>As the dominant force in the Western lands, the Great Compassion Temple should be safe from interruption during Master Zhitang's tribulation, especially with Qin Sang, a Transcendent cultivator, present.  There was no need for so many protectors.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, sensing the outside world with his spiritual sense.  Part of his mind was linked to the Ming Wang scroll.</p><p>Shortly after, he felt a subtle change, and a thought arose in his heart:  "He succeeded in breaking through!"</p><p>Simultaneously, the spiritual tide on the summit of the main peak reached a phenomenal level.  A primal fear arose in the hearts of the surrounding monks. The scene at the center of the spiritual tide distorted as the Yin Fire Tribulation arrived!</p><p>The monks couldn't see Master Zhitang, but they could sense the fluctuations of the Yin Fire.</p><p>The Yin Fire Tribulation was the weakest of the Transcendence Tribulations. Those strong enough to attempt transcendence should easily overcome the Yin Fire Tribulation.</p><p>At this moment, the monks' attention shifted from the main peak to Qin Sang.</p><p>Soon, a Buddha's light shone above the rock where Qin Sang sat. The scroll slowly rose, unfurling in the air to reveal the form of the Immovable King.</p><p>The Ming Wang scroll disappeared within the Buddha's light, replaced by a real Immovable King, seemingly stepping out of the painting.  He faced the main peak, observing the person undergoing the tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang sat behind the Immovable King's image, his hands forming Buddhist hand seals, chanting mantras. The mantras sounded similar to those chanted by Master Huaiyin, yet possessed a peculiar rhythm.</p><p>Under the power of the mantras, the flames behind the Immovable King seemed to intensify, engulfing Qin Sang. Master Huaiyin retreated several meters.</p><p>By this time, the Yin Fire Tribulation had reached its peak and began to subside.</p><p>The moment the Yin Fire completely disappeared, Qin Sang finished his mantra, let out a low shout, and suddenly opened his eyes, his expression mirroring the wrathful face of the Immovable King.</p><p>In that instant, the man and the image seemed to merge as one.</p><p>The Immovable King raised his sword, pointing it towards the main peak, and shot a golden ray of light.</p><p>The moment the light left, all its mystical qualities vanished. The Immovable King image shattered, reverting to the Ming Wang scroll, its spiritual light dimming as it fell into Qin Sang's lap.</p><p>Others only saw the golden light fly towards the main peak. Qin Sang, however, saw it strike Master Zhitang in the center of his forehead, dyeing his white eyebrows and beard gold.</p><p>Unseen by Qin Sang, Master Zhitang's spiritual body within his spirit sea seemed to be clad in golden armor.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Wind Tribulation appeared!</p><p>Qin Sang caught the Ming Wang scroll and tossed it to Master Huaiyin, his gaze fixed on the main peak.  Confirming that the tribulation hadn't spread, he calmly began to regulate his breath, waiting for the Mental Tribulation.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang didn't have a precise understanding of the Heavenly Demon Sound's power.  He could only estimate its range without personal experience.</p><p>Strange phenomena continued on the main peak.</p><p>After the Wind Tribulation, dark clouds gathered, and thunder descended.</p><p>Deafening thunder shook the earth.</p><p>Waves of thunderbolts rained down on the main peak. Amidst the lightning, flashes of treasure light occasionally appeared, along with sounds of shattering, indicating that artifacts and treasures were being destroyed.</p><p>Most striking was a black Ruyi scepter.</p><p>Initially, the occurrences were sporadic. But after the Heavenly Thunder Tribulation, Master Zhitang began to expertly wield the black Ruyi, like a black dragon soaring and diving, capable of swallowing thunder from above and protecting its master below.</p><p>The terrifying thunderbolts made the monks' eyelids twitch nervously.  They were unsure of Master Zhitang's condition, but judging by the black Ruyi's fluctuating luster—sometimes bright, sometimes dim—it seemed he wasn't having an easy time.</p><p>Amidst their growing worry, the tribulation clouds birthed a final thunderbolt, striking the main peak, accompanied by a torrential surge of spiritual energy cascading down with the thunder.</p><p>On the main peak,</p><p>a stick of incense appeared beside Master Zhitang.  Simultaneously enduring the thunder and spiritual energy, his expression solemn, he swept his sleeve and lit it.</p><p>A fragrant aroma filled the air, clearing his mind.</p><p>At that moment, Master Zhitang finally 'heard' the Heavenly Devil's Sound!</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang, Master Huaiyin, and Master Xingji across the way, all flew towards the main peak, witnessing the remnants of the tribulation formation on the peak and the aged monk seated within.</p><p>Suddenly, Master Xingji sighed deeply.</p><p>Qin Sang heard Master Xingji's telepathic message, his tone filled with pity,  "Master Zhitang was too obsessed with the breakthrough technique."</p><p>Master Zhitang was now weeping and laughing uncontrollably, sometimes laughing hysterically, sometimes wailing, occasionally even displaying lascivious gestures.  All seven emotions and six desires manifested simultaneously, experiencing countless illusions of inner demons. Whether laughing or crying, his expression was increasingly crazed.</p><p>This was a clear manifestation of his inner demons, leaving no hope of recovery.</p><p>The Spirit-Subduing Incense burned beside him, its fragrance drifting, yet unable to pull Master Zhitang from the tribulation of inner demons.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. He had heard of True Person Zilei's performance during his final moments—even then, he managed to maintain a sliver of clarity.  Master Zhitang's performance was even worse.</p><p>The Spirit-Subduing Incense wasn't entirely ineffective; their experiences and temperaments differed, as did their methods and artifacts. Without it, Master Zhitang's state would undoubtedly have been far worse.</p><p>Master Xingji's assessment was spot on.  Master Zhitang had spent three hundred years merely accumulating power; the prior preparations were unknown, but his extreme dedication to this technique made turning back impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang and Master Xingji exchanged a look, silently withdrawing from the mountain, choosing not to witness Master Zhitang's chaotic emotional and sensual turmoil, thus preserving the face of Great Compassion Temple.</p><p>The monks surrounded the main peak, their expressions filled with sorrow.</p><p>The next day,</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the activation of the quiet room's restriction, pushing open the door to find Master Huaiyin standing outside, his expression calm, bowing respectfully, "This monk, on behalf of the Abbot, thanks the True Monarch for his protection."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "Master, there's no need for such courtesy. Master Zhitang knowingly pursued the impossible; I am in no position to judge. Please accept my condolences."</p><p>Master Zhitang had left instructions: if he failed the tribulation, everything was to be kept simple.  His passing was due to the tribulation of inner demons; his body was intact. The monks, according to his wishes, cremated his remains, placing his relics in a Buddhist shrine.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed until the memorial service ended before taking his leave.  He departed with Master Xingji.</p><p>Following Master Zhitang's demise, including Master Huaiyin, the monks' gaze towards Qin Sang transformed, carrying newfound respect. Others couldn't understand whether it was the superior Spirit-Subduing Incense's efficacy exceeding expectations or Qin Zhenjun's exceptional composure and impeccable character.</p><p>Qin Sang himself was also pondering. Witnessing the Heavenly Devil's Sound's power firsthand, he now understood the tribulation's terror.  Was the superior Spirit-Subduing Incense truly effective?</p><p>Regardless, refining the superior Spirit-Subduing Incense was a necessity. After all, they had three medicinal embryos; after refining them, they would test their efficacy.</p><p>Returning to Central State,</p><p>Master Xingji invited Qin Sang to the Ganlu Zen Monastery, which was declined.</p><p>The Western Territory was just one region.  The further reaches of the Canglang Sea and the North Sea awaited, time was of the essence.</p><p>He'd already made the necessary arrangements, not even returning to Luye, instead crossing the East Sea directly, entering the storm belt.</p><p>He planned to go to the Canglang Sea first.</p><p>Before leaving the North Sea, he'd given instructions. People there continued searching for the Ascension Platform, though not with the same intensity as Central and Western States.</p><p>Traveling through the storm belt after achieving the Transcendence stage was vastly different from his Yuan Ying stage experience.</p><p>He could now partially manipulate the power of Heaven and Earth, directly absorbing the chaotic spiritual energy within the storm belt. While not as efficient as in the cultivation world, it sufficed to replenish his energy, allowing for extended travel, eliminating the need to borrow the Ten Directions Earth-Opening Divine Shuttle from Liuli.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush, flying leisurely, utilizing the time to cultivate various divine abilities and techniques.</p><p>Refining the radiant gold energy within his body was a must.  Additionally, Qin Sang found that the "Inner Lion Seal" and the "Seven Teacher Buddha Seal," both being Buddha seals, could be cultivated together, yielding good results.</p><p>He would occasionally summon the Grey Sparrow Sword, practicing the "Seven Constellations Subdivision Sword Formation."</p><p>The poison pearl within him continuously absorbed poisonous fumes.</p><p>His strength steadily increased during his long journey.</p><p>Perhaps Qin Sang was fortunate, as he traversed the storm belt for nearly twenty years without encountering any ferocious beasts.</p><p>(End)</p>
