<h1>Chapter 661: The Demonic Beast Pill</h1><p>Perhaps this rule was established to prevent a Wu Clan Nascent Soul cultivator from stealing the treasures within the Seven Killing Hall. After all, Foundation Establishment cultivators have limited cultivation and are certainly no match for a human Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>This prevents the Wu Clan's Nascent Soul ancestors from entering.</p><p>Wu Clan cultivators needn't worry about being ambushed in the Seven Killing Hall; the human and Wu clans have an agreement to cooperate against the demonic beasts in the Stormy Demon Sea.</p><p>The two races maintain a superficial harmony in the Canglang Sea, haven't had a major battle for a long time, and their relationship is much smoother than before.</p><p>Furthermore, the human race made a promise to the Wu Clan regarding the Seven Killing Hall, and they wouldn't break their alliance and suffer the humiliation for a mere group of Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Therefore, whenever news of the Seven Killing Hall's opening spreads, a group of Wu Clan Foundation Establishment cultivators travel across the ocean to seek treasure, with Du Han being one of them.</p><p>As for why Du Han, still in the early stage of Foundation Establishment, went such a long distance to enter a human secret realm, it's related to the path he's chosen.</p><p>This also answers Qin Sang's previous doubts.</p><p>The Canglang Sea largely matches the information Qin Sang previously investigated: spiritual materials and elixirs, especially those of the highest grade, are extremely scarce, unlike the abundance in Xiao Han Domain.</p><p>However, Foundation Establishment is surprisingly easier here than in Xiao Han Domain.</p><p>This is related to a pill called the Demonic Beast Pill.</p><p>This pill is similar to the Blood Bone Pill, made from demonic beasts and some not-so-rare herbs, with a miraculous effect in aiding Foundation Establishment!</p><p>Both the Wu and human clans use demonic beasts for pill refinement; it's not because the Blood Bone Pill and the Demonic Beast Pill are related, but because they have no choice.</p><p>Lacking other resources, they can only use demonic beasts.</p><p>While hunting demonic beasts in the Stormy Demon Sea is very dangerous, it's much easier than finding heavenly treasures, which are almost nonexistent.</p><p>However, like the Blood Bone Pill, the Demonic Beast Pill carries significant risks.</p><p>Because it's made from demonic beasts, the Demonic Beast Pill contains a trace of demonic煞 energy that even the Canglang Sea's master alchemists cannot remove.</p><p>When a cultivator at the Fake Core stage refines the Demonic Beast Pill's energy, it stimulates the dantian's spiritual energy, increasing the chance of breakthrough.  However, the demonic煞 energy will also invade the cultivator's body and take root in their primordial spirit!</p><p>The more Demonic Beast Pills consumed, the more demonic煞 energy accumulates.</p><p>If the demonic煞 energy erupts, the cultivator will go insane, losing their mind, with no cure. Therefore, there's a limit to how many pills each person can take; they cannot be used recklessly.</p><p>Even so, the probability of Foundation Establishment is much higher than in Xiao Han Domain.</p><p>However, the hidden danger of demonic煞 entering the body gradually manifests after Foundation Establishment. Not only will the cultivator have a faint demonic aura, but their strength after Foundation Establishment will also be affected.</p><p>Worst of all, if the demonic煞 energy in the primordial spirit isn't removed, the difficulty of future breakthroughs will also be affected.</p><p>During minor realm breakthroughs, the impact is barely tolerable.</p><p>But when attempting Nascent Soul stage, even a trace of demonic煞 energy in the primordial spirit makes success absolutely impossible!</p><p>Every cultivator who breaks through using Demonic Beast Pills must embark on a long journey of refining their primordial spirit and removing the demonic煞 after achieving Foundation Establishment. The demonic煞 rooted in the primordial spirit is extremely stubborn; many cultivators, even those in the late stage of Foundation Establishment, cannot completely remove it, leaving them unable to even aspire to Nascent Soul.</p><p>Therefore, the Canglang Sea has significantly more successful Foundation Establishments than Xiao Han Domain for the same number of Fake Core cultivators, but the number of those who achieve Nascent Soul is roughly the same.</p><p>Only cultivators near the Stormy Demon Sea can refine this Demonic Beast Pill; Xiao Han Domain doesn't have enough demonic beasts for slaughter.</p><p>After all, refining Demonic Beast Pills also has requirements for the demonic beasts; those at the peak of the Spirit Stage and the early stage of the Core Formation Stage are ideal.</p><p>If their cultivation is too low, the medicinal power is insufficient.</p><p>If their cultivation is too high, the Demonic Beast Pill contains too much demonic煞 energy, which the consumer cannot withstand.</p><p>Furthermore, the Demonic Beast Pill has five elements, and there are considerations for which pill a cultivator should take.</p><p>The allure of the Demonic Beast Pill is too great, giving hope to cultivators unable to achieve Foundation Establishment.</p><p>While there are many who choose to break through on their own, these are only the exceptionally talented and supremely confident; the vast majority find it difficult to resist the temptation of the Demonic Beast Pill.</p><p>Qin Sang understands this mindset.  He had similar thoughts when he sold himself to achieve Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Breakthrough first, then address the hidden dangers later.</p><p>This was good news for Qin Sang.  His future opponents, weakened by the demonic煞 (sha), would be easier to deal with.</p><p>Qin Sang even considered taking a few Demonic煞 Pills himself, to appear weaker to his enemies.</p><p>He wasn't afraid of the demonic煞 invading his soul thanks to his jade Buddha.</p><p>After hearing about the effects of the Demonic煞 Pills from Du Han, Qin Sang was lost in thought.</p><p>Protected by the jade Buddha, the dangers of the pills were nonexistent; he could take as many as he wanted. If he’d been in the Canglang Sea back then, why would he have had to work so hard, turning himself into a corpse just to find a chance to form his Golden Core?</p><p>However, if he'd been here, he would have missed out on the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* (Soul Cultivation Sword Chapter).</p><p>It was a choice between the difficulty of the breakthrough and the speed of cultivation.</p><p>Only Qin Sang could weigh the pros and cons.</p><p>Qin Sang had felt that Du Han was somewhat overrated, precisely because of the Demonic煞 Pills.</p><p>While effective, only a few Wu tribe cultivators chose to take them.</p><p>Firstly, because of the hidden dangers.</p><p>Secondly, for some reason, after the demonic煞 entered their bodies, their innate talent was lost, unable to suppress the backlash of their soul-linked insects, forcing them to give up cultivation.</p><p>Not only did their strength suffer greatly, but years of hard work would be destroyed.</p><p>Moreover, it was said that the success rate of breaking through using the pills wasn't much higher than using their soul-linked insects.  Wu tribe cultivators only considered it as a last resort.</p><p>Du Han, having given up hope of forming his Golden Core, had made the drastic decision to abandon his soul-linked insects and used the pills to successfully form his Golden Core.</p><p>Having taken this step, there was no turning back.</p><p>After forming his Golden Core, Du Han went out to train and befriended many human cultivators. He then switched to human cultivation techniques, which is why he entered the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Unexpectedly, his first time at the Seven Kills Hall, he encountered a major event – the falling ancient corpse!</p><p>The scene left a deep impression on the cultivators present.  Some quick-witted individuals preserved it in crystal; Du Han had one piece in his pouch.</p><p>The falling ancient corpse happened near the most magnificent tower in the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>This tower, surrounded by clouds and reaching the heavens, was known as the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>The Heavenly Tower was filled with countless restrictions and was extremely dangerous.  Legend had it that even human Yuan Ying masters couldn't reach the top.</p><p>In such a place, a sudden ancient corpse falling from the sky was unprecedented, causing an enormous stir.</p><p>Many suspected that the armless corpse was that of an ancient cultivator from the top of the Heavenly Tower. Even if not, any cultivator who could reach the top would be extraordinary and might possess precious treasures.</p><p>Many cultivators, including Yuan Ying masters, were drawn to the area at the time.</p><p>Yet, everyone could only watch helplessly as the armless corpse vanished into thin air.</p>
