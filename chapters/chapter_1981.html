<h1>Chapter 1972: The Jitian Convocation</h1><p>Yu Lang held the command arrow, its surface shimmering with brightly illuminated characters.</p><p>"It's Master!"</p><p>Tao Teng, observing the scene, sent a voice transmission, his tone a mixture of joy and apprehension.</p><p>He and Yu Lang had long suspected that his master might be the mastermind behind the scenes, and now it was confirmed.</p><p>The Cloud Immortal Master spoken of by the Kuang family was indeed Tao Teng's master, a cultivator from Cloud Metropolis Heaven.</p><p>Lines of characters floated before him.</p><p>Yu Lang read every word, finally understanding certain matters.</p><p>Cloud Metropolis Mountain had dispatched more cultivators than just him and Tao Teng; Zhao Du and many others were also involved.</p><p>But why not have these individuals join forces, unifying the military might of the various nations into a single, cohesive force? Wouldn't that lead to a swifter victory?</p><p>It turned out this was a form of selection.</p><p>Under his governance, the Yan Kingdom had flourished.</p><p>With skillful administration and a powerful military, the Yan Kingdom stood out, and Yu Lang became the chosen one.</p><p>Henceforth, the Yan Kingdom and its neighboring nations, all falling under the influence of Cloud Metropolis Heaven, were at his command.  He was, essentially, the supreme commander.</p><p>And his mission was to aid the Yan Kingdom in unifying the world!</p><p>However, Yu Lang noticed that the so-called "world" mentioned on the command arrow only included the Yan, Qi, Liang, and a dozen other nearby kingdoms.</p><p>It was merely a part of the mortal realm.</p><p>This meant that similar events were likely unfolding elsewhere.</p><p>The mortal realm was divided into regions, each a game board.  The pieces on each board competed, influencing the overall game.</p><p>Perhaps, he was only temporarily chosen.</p><p>The victors on each board would compete again until a "Child of Destiny" was selected!</p><p>"What is Cloud Metropolis Heaven planning?"</p><p>Yu Lang pondered, rubbing the command arrow.</p><p>"Do they intend to unify the mortal realm, leaving only one nation under heaven, ending the era of chaos?</p><p>"But the mortal realm is so vast, its territory far exceeding mortal comprehension. With mortal capabilities, it's simply impossible to govern.</p><p>"How can they control the regions? How can decrees be effectively communicated?</p><p>"Not to mention, during the Imperial Examinations, by the time citizens from the border regions traverse thousands of mountains and rivers to reach the Imperial Capital, countless years will have passed.</p><p>"The mortal realm is not without ambitious rulers, nor does it lack the ambition to unify the world. It's not that they don't want to, but they simply cannot.</p><p>"Unless..."</p><p>A thought struck Yu Lang.</p><p>Unless cultivators ceased their seclusion, entered the court as officials, and governed with their arts, all these problems would be readily solved.</p><p>Yu Lang glanced at the seven Kuang siblings before him, a realization dawning upon him.</p><p>...</p><p>Outside the Yan Kingdom's capital city.</p><p>The Cloud Immortal Master's cave.</p><p>Today, the stone gate was wide open, welcoming an uninvited guest.</p><p>The chill of late autumn was already palpable, yet the cave was warm as spring.</p><p>A stone table stood within, with a figure seated on each side.</p><p>One was a white-haired man with a youthful face, clad in the robes of Cloud Metropolis Heaven. This was Tao Teng's master, the Cloud Immortal Master.</p><p>The other wore a cloak, concealing their face completely, exuding a sinister aura compared to the Cloud Immortal Master.</p><p>Immortal tea was served, but the cloaked figure made no move to partake, stating coldly, "Yun Shan, by allowing the merging of immortals and mortals, are you planning to break our agreement?"</p><p>"What agreement? Back then, that fiend Jing Cang dared to ascend our sect's mountain gate.  If the Sect Master hadn't ordered us to spare the envoy, that fiend would have been slain on the spot!  Regardless of Jing Cang's silver tongue, the Sect Master made no promises!" the Cloud Immortal Master scoffed.</p><p>The cloaked figure snorted, "Shameless old man! Must I spell it out for you? If not for the unspoken understanding between Gu Yun Sou and our Master, how could things have progressed to this point?!"</p><p>The Cloud Immortal Master chuckled.</p><p>"Times change. Initially, I assumed you genuinely intended to use the mortal realm as a game board, to minimize casualties between our sects and prevent others from exploiting our vulnerability.</p><p>"As expected, your demonic nature is hard to suppress!</p><p>"Don't think you can hide your wicked ambitions from us, you fiends. We knew all along you harbored ulterior motives.</p><p>"Following your methods, a true victor can never emerge. It will only lead to increasing chaos, turning the mortal realm into a hellish landscape of corpses and demonic energy!</p><p>"How can we, righteous cultivators, stand idly by?!"</p><p>"Such noble words!" The cloaked figure cackled, their tone dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>"Without your acquiescence, who could wreak havoc in the mortal realm?</p><p>"First, you used my Falling Soul Abyss to suppress the Divine Dao, preventing the True Purity Sect from interfering, and shifting their pressure onto us.  Then, with the arrival of chaos, you raise the banner of righteousness, using the suppression of demons as an excuse to completely control the mortal realm.</p><p>"From then on, only one nation will remain in the mortal realm, all cultivators and deities registered under your celestial roster, impenetrable.</p><p>"Cloud Metropolis Heaven will then be free of worries, focusing solely on the Jitian Convocation.</p><p>"Manipulating everything at will! Such righteousness, such a cunning plan!"</p><p>The Cloud Immortal Master offered no denial, their expression unchanged.</p><p>The cloaked figure continued to sneer, "It seems a confrontation is unavoidable?  As I understand it, though both our sides have unearthed numerous ancient formation remnants in the Fire Domain, without joining forces, we are far from meeting the Jitian Sect's requirements.  The reward offered by the Jitian Sect this time is a once-in-a-ten-thousand-year opportunity!  This should be mutually beneficial. If we miss this chance because of you, I'd like to see if Gu Yun Sou can remain composed!"</p><p>The Cloud Immortal Master slowly rose, walked to the entrance, and gazed at the rolling mountains, saying indifferently, "If you achieve victory on the battlefield and unify the mortal realm, we will naturally withdraw, and at the Jitian Convocation, we will defer to Falling Soul Abyss! Isn't that your original intention?"</p><p>"Fine!"</p><p>The cloaked figure slammed the table, their figure flickering and vanishing from the cave.</p><p>The Cloud Immortal Master watched the direction of their departure for a long while, unmoving.</p><p>...</p><p>The Great Liang Kingdom.</p><p>The banks of the Du River.</p><p>The duel between the two Nascent Soul cultivators was earth-shattering.</p><p>The radiant light of the horsetail whisk and the glint of the saber clashed in the sky, producing peals of thunder that shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>The river surface alternately froze and shattered, with both armies retreating ten miles, none daring to approach the riverbank.</p><p>Tao Teng and the others worked to reassure their troops, achieving some success.</p><p>Everyone watched the sky, witnessing the mighty duel.</p><p>For a time, the Kuang family ancestor and Old Devil Yu were evenly matched.</p><p>Gray mist shrouded the river surface, the two figures flickering in and out of sight.</p><p>Realizing they couldn't achieve victory quickly, Old Devil Yu lost interest in the prolonged fight with the Kuang ancestor and fiercely lashed out with his horsetail whisk.</p><p>"Swish!"</p><p>A stream of light, like a saber strike, shot straight towards the Kuang ancestor's face.</p><p>A clang rang out as the Kuang ancestor intercepted with his sword. Then, Old Devil Yu transformed into a streak of light, fleeing upstream along the Du River.</p><p>"Where do you think you're going?!"</p><p>The Kuang ancestor roared, giving chase.</p><p>Before departing, his lips moved slightly, transmitting a message. The seven Kuang siblings bowed towards the river, responding loudly in acknowledgement.</p><p>As the two Nascent Soul cultivators fought while retreating, the mist on the river dissipated, revealing the two army camps.</p><p>The soldiers on both sides were still immersed in the previous duel, awestruck and unable to extricate themselves, momentarily unresponsive.</p><p>Just then, from the eastern camp, several streaks of light flew out, revealing a dozen figures confronting Yu Lang and the others across the river.</p><p>"General Qin! These individuals are all demons under Old Devil Yu, their hands stained with blood, guilty of countless murders! We request permission to leave the camp and slay these demons!"</p><p>The eldest of the seven Kuang siblings declared, cupping his fists.</p><p>"Haha!"</p><p>A burst of laughter echoed from the opposite bank, "Kuang Shou Yi, on the battlefield, there's no talk of righteousness or evil!  You, a defeated foe of the past, why don't you come and meet your death!"</p><p>Yu Lang hadn't fully adapted to his current role.</p><p>He had learned that among the seven Kuang siblings, only the sixth and seventh were of comparable cultivation to him, while the other five surpassed him, with the eldest and second being False Core Realm experts.</p><p>Now, they were under his command, requesting permission to fight.</p><p>"Hu!"</p><p>Yu Lang couldn't help but exhale softly, composing himself before stating gravely, "Immortal Master Kuang, I hereby appoint you Vanguard General. Go forth and claim the enemy general's head to bolster our army's morale!"</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Kuang Shou Yi replied loudly, summoning a spiritual sword and charging towards the enemy.</p><p>Simultaneously, five of the other Kuang siblings followed Kuang Shou Yi towards the enemy formation.</p><p>The seventh Kuang sibling remained, patting the mustard seed bag at his waist and retrieving dozens of triangular apricot-yellow flags, presenting them with both hands.</p><p>"Reporting to General Qin, these are Blood Essence Flags, personally refined by our ancestor under the guidance of the Cloud Immortal Master."</p><p>Yu Lang accepted the Blood Essence Flags, his brow furrowing slightly.</p><p>As Qin Sang's disciple, he had occasionally been allowed to peruse some of his master's refining manuals.</p><p>These Blood Essence Flags were unlike any artifacts he had seen before, suggesting a special purpose.</p><p>"When an army is arrayed, its blood qi soars to the heavens, dispersing any approaching ghosts. If this blood qi can be harnessed, it can also grant superhuman abilities. The Blood Essence Flags serve this purpose. General Qin, distribute these flags throughout the army and drill formations based on them.  Led by cultivators, with the flags pointing the way, the blood qi will surge like a dragon, deterring even enemy cultivators from entering the battlefield and slaughtering at will."</p><p>The seventh Kuang sibling explained quickly.</p><p>Hearing this, Yu Lang's eyes lit up. So, mortals weren't entirely powerless.</p><p>The blood qi of ordinary soldiers could also shine on the battlefield.</p><p>Although this power wasn't overwhelming, with higher-level cultivators occupied, it could still influence the battle to a certain extent!</p><p>"Tao Teng, where are you!"</p><p>Yu Lang turned towards the rear.</p><p>"I am here!"</p><p>Tao Teng no longer concealed his cultivation, flying into the air.</p><p>Yu Lang tossed the Blood Essence Flags to Tao Teng, explained their function, and commanded, "Quickly distribute these flags to the various generals, drill formations, and in one month, we cross the river and attack!"</p><p>Due to the duel between the two Nascent Soul cultivators, the pontoon bridges and warships on the river were severely damaged.</p><p>Both sides needed at least a month to prepare for a river crossing.</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Tao Teng took his leave.</p><p>Yu Lang turned back to see the six Kuang siblings already engaged in battle with the enemy. Though not as powerful as the Nascent Soul cultivators, they still created considerable commotion.</p><p>Shifting his gaze, Yu Lang observed the enemy camp, noticing a similar aura emanating from within, indicating a similar tactic to the Blood Essence Flags.</p><p>At this moment, Sha Jia Yu, who had been observing from the side, transmitted a message, "Brother, do you need me to intervene?"</p><p>With the departure of the Kuang ancestor and Old Devil Yu, there were no other Nascent Soul auras nearby.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu could easily dispose of those minor demons.</p><p>"No! Although the Kuang family is few in number, they work well together. As long as they aren't defeated, we shouldn't complicate matters.  Unless absolutely necessary, Brother Sha, please don't intervene."</p><p>Yu Lang replied softly.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu nodded, continuing to play the role of a personal guard.</p><p>By then, Tao Teng had completed his arrangements and returned.</p><p>Yu Lang handed him the command arrow: "The Cloud Immortal Master has decreed that this arrow represents him. Take this command, accompanied by Brother Sha, and quickly visit the major righteous sects, requesting their aid. In one month, there will likely be a fierce battle.  Also, return to the Daoist Temple and inform Master of this."</p><p>"What about you?" Tao Teng was concerned.  Yu Lang was a major target; an old devil had tried to kill him before.</p><p>"Senior Kuang has returned. With Senior Kuang here, there's no need to worry about my safety," Yu Lang said. Through Sha Jia Yu, he already knew the outcome of the upstream duel.</p><p>It was essentially a draw.</p><p>Old Devil Yu, having suffered a setback, had retreated.</p><p>Just as he finished speaking, a streak of azure light flew from upstream, landing directly in the command tent without a word.</p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p>Sha Jia Yu and Tao Teng changed into plain clothes and quietly departed.</p><p>Yu Lang observed the troops drilling with the Blood Essence Flags while also keeping an eye on the duel across the river. Seeing the six Kuang siblings gradually losing ground, he immediately ordered the troops to retreat.</p><p>Both sides withdrew, the situation temporarily stabilizing.</p><p>Yu Lang returned to the command tent and saw the Kuang family ancestor meditating on a cushion, eyes closed. Not daring to disturb him, he quietly withdrew.</p><p>As the sun set and the moon rose, the day passed.</p><p>For the soldiers of both armies, however, the world had undergone a dramatic transformation.</p><p>The next day at noon.</p><p>After a night of recuperation, the seven Kuang siblings went out to challenge the enemy again.</p><p>As the duel was reaching its climax, Sha Jia Yu hurried back, bringing Yu Lang something.</p><p>"We went to the Green Ram Daoist Temple first.  The Daoist Priest instructed me to give these to you."</p><p>Sha Jia Yu opened his palm, revealing three bamboo slips.</p><p>The slips were smooth and blank.</p><p>"The Daoist Priest said that in times of crisis, you should light a slip, and he will arrive instantly!"  Sha Jia Yu said excitedly.</p><p>Yu Lang was overjoyed.</p><p>Having suddenly shouldered such a heavy responsibility, he had been somewhat uneasy, but now he felt a sense of calm.</p><p>He accepted the slips, examining them fondly before carefully storing them away.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu then departed again.</p><p>...</p><p>Over the next month, cultivators gradually arrived at both camps, mostly Foundation Establishment and Qi Refining cultivators.</p><p>Some came seeking amusement, some were arrogant and unruly, but upon learning of the Kuang family ancestor's presence in the camp, none dared to cause trouble.</p><p>Yu Lang, methodical and composed, continued to send out challenges while integrating these cultivators into the army, training them in the use of the Blood Essence Flags.</p><p>In just one month, the army underwent a dramatic transformation.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>The weather was fine, the river calm.</p><p>Dozens of figures flew out from both banks, engaging in an aerial battle.</p><p>The armies mobilized, warships and pontoon bridges reaching the eastern bank.</p><p>A fierce battle unfolded on the shore, a chaotic and bloody melee.</p><p>In the end, the Great Liang Kingdom's cultivators were the first to falter, their army's formation crumbling under the Yan Kingdom's assault, suffering a crushing defeat.</p><p>The Yan Kingdom's forces, unstoppable, seized the Great Liang Kingdom's capital in one fell swoop.</p><p>Following this, a flurry of secret letters arrived like snowflakes.</p><p>Before Yu Lang lay a sand table encompassing all the kingdoms, including the Yan Kingdom, studded with small black and white flags.</p><p>The current situation was clear at a glance.</p><p>As the central commander, all armies were under his command until the conflict with Falling Soul Abyss was resolved.</p><p>...</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Following the Great Liang Kingdom, the Qi Kingdom was also annexed by the Yan Kingdom.</p><p>The Yan Kingdom's forces rested, but elsewhere, battles raged on, with Cloud Metropolis Heaven's side holding a significant advantage.</p><p>Five years passed.</p><p>Yu Lang spent these five years entirely on the battlefield.</p><p>On this day, the two sides met for the final confrontation, the decisive battle finally upon them.</p><p>Unable to achieve a breakthrough, Yu Lang lit a bamboo slip for the first time.</p>
