<h1>Chapter 1388: Deception</h1><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang became suspicious.</p><p>Others were scrambling for the ice casket.</p><p>Hongshu, instead of vying for the casket, secretly left the island at this critical moment, deceiving not only the human cultivators but seemingly also the妖 Kings, who were unaware of its movements.</p><p>Something was amiss!</p><p>Moreover, Hongshu transformed into an ice rat, hiding within the ice explosion, its aura perfectly concealed.</p><p>The ice explosion triggered by the man in white seemed specifically prepared for it.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred.</p><p>His gaze swept between the man in white and Hongshu.</p><p>He could confirm that the man in white he had locked onto was the real one!</p><p>This was strange.</p><p>However, the situation was volatile and ever-changing.  Qin Sang had limited information and no time to untangle everything. He made an instinctive decision.</p><p>Remaining calm, he continued pursuing the man in white, but secretly, without alerting anyone to Hongshu’s suspicious activity.</p><p>Simultaneously, a ripple appeared in the void around Qin Sang.</p><p>The other Nascent Soul cultivators and 妖 Kings were all focused on the man in white and the ice casket, failing to notice an invisible butterfly leaving Qin Sang, gently flapping its wings, following the direction Hongshu had fled, off the island!</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly danced gracefully, its figure light.</p><p>Its innate invisibility was its ultimate life-saving skill.</p><p>However, compared to other cultivators and beasts of the same cultivation level, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly was too frail; Qin Sang rarely allowed it out of his sight for fear of accidents.</p><p>Hongshu was clearly weakened.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly was highly intelligent, and there were Nascent Soul puppets nearby to provide support. Dealing with one Hongshu should be foolproof; there was no need to worry about the butterfly's safety.</p><p>That's right!</p><p>Qin Sang suspected Hongshu had secretly taken something, planning a stealth attack.</p><p>Even if he was wrong, there was no loss.</p><p>Outside the island.</p><p>Hongshu succeeded, glancing back.</p><p>Its eyes were strangely pale, like two snow beads embedded in its head, its gaze vacant, then a flicker of struggle appeared.</p><p>Hongshu abruptly turned and fled rapidly along the sea surface toward the storm belt!</p><p>After Hongshu had travelled some distance, a dark shadow surfaced silently from the sea.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly then arrived, lightly alighting on the shadow's shoulder, a puppet and butterfly following in pursuit of Hongshu.</p><p>On the island.</p><p>The fighting intensified.</p><p>The man in white's true form was finally exposed.</p><p>Instantly, all eyes focused on him.</p><p>Seeming to know his fate was sealed, the man in white, without looking back, fought his way forward in a final desperate attempt to escape.</p><p>Although not the closest to the man in white, Qin Sang, aided by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, had early locked onto his true form.</p><p>He moved swiftly, flashing across several mountain ranges in an instant, simultaneously summoning the Golden Sinking Sword and striking at the man’s back.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A muffled sound.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft "huh," surprised to find a crystal-clear circular shield appearing out of thin air behind the man in white.</p><p>The shield was small, made entirely of profound ice, seemingly thin and fragile, and shattered on impact, yet it successfully blocked Qin Sang's strike.</p><p>The man in white, propelled by the immense force, stumbled forward, instantly leaping up to continue his escape.</p><p>"Something's wrong!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.</p><p>Although the exchange was brief, Qin Sang keenly sensed something odd about the man in white.</p><p>However, Bi Fang and other 妖 were only half a beat slower than Qin Sang, because after the man in white activated the formation, they received a message from Hongshu.</p><p>Hongshu had left a mark inside the man in white, an illusion that couldn’t be erased.</p><p>Feng Shangshi and the others, on the other hand, were initially like headless flies.  Qin Sang hadn't warned them, leading them to identify the man in white's true form last, making their attacks the slowest.</p><p>For Nascent Soul cultivators, every second counted.</p><p>For a time, streams of escaping light relentlessly pursued the man in white, some faster, some slower.</p><p>Qin Sang practically kept pace with Bi Fang.</p><p>Wa Yu, being the closest to the man in white, quickly caught up.  The other 妖 Kings were left behind, some even scrambling for the ice casket.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to face a two-on-one situation, Feng Shangshi did not disappoint, transforming into a gust of wind, surging past others, closely following them.</p><p>"Please hinder them for a bit! Once I succeed, you'll have a share of the treasure!"</p><p>Feng Shangshi, inwardly anxious, sent a voice transmission to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and she coldly snorted, "Just who is he? It seems Daoist friend already knew the inside story? But I was kept in the dark!"</p><p>Feng Shangshi showed no shame, directly stating the key point, "This person is from Xuan Tian Palace, carrying a treasure of Xuan Tian Palace, hence the demons' covetousness!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p>Since arriving in the North Sea, the great name of Xuan Tian Palace has been deafening.</p><p>A behemoth dominating a region, its palace master a powerful cultivator.</p><p>Now, with Shijie and Ye Laomo's ascension, the Bei Chen region still lacks a powerful cultivator.  The experts of Xuan Tian Palace alone are enough to surpass the entire Bei Chen region.</p><p>Even in the North Sea, Xuan Tian Palace is acknowledged as the number one human force!</p><p>A person in white clothes, actually from Xuan Tian Palace, traveled across the ocean and appeared near the Xuan Yue region, and he carries a Xuan Tian Palace treasure.</p><p>No wonder these demon kings and Yuan Ying cultivators are so frantic.</p><p>Once this news spreads, I'm afraid even the experts of Xuan Yue region won't be able to sit still.</p><p>Thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind, she suddenly slashed a sword at the frog-fish, and with a flick of her sleeve, unleashed her demonic fire without reservation, turning the sky into a sea of fire, burning the mountain peak – targeting Bi Fang.</p><p>Bi Fang was furious and wanted to scold Qin Sang.</p><p>However, after sensing the power of the demonic fire, Bi Fang's heart tightened, and he was shocked.</p><p>In the sea battle just now, this person hadn't used his full strength, he still held back.</p><p>If he had used his full power to stop him with the demonic fire at that time, even if Bi Fang had used this blood flame transformation ability, it wouldn't have been so easy to escape!</p><p>The demonic fire pressed down.</p><p>Bi Fang's figure was enveloped in shadow, and he let out a long roar.</p><p>The roar was like thunder, deafening.</p><p>Bi Fang, maintaining his blood flame bird form, exploded under the pressure of the demonic fire, unleashing another transformation of his ability; the blood flames began to contract inward, forming numerous blood-red, crystalline feathers.</p><p>Covered in blood flame feathers, Bi Fang was like an arrow from a bow, seeming to pierce the void, fiercely charging into the demonic fire!</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>The frog-fish took Qin Sang's sword head-on, a large section of its scales shattered, but it was only a superficial injury. It ignored the other battlefields; its eyes were only on the person in white.</p><p>Feng Shangshi was overjoyed to see Qin Sang convinced, his figure like the wind, he rushed to the front.</p><p>At this time, Feng Shangshi and the frog-fish were closest to the person in white.</p><p>In the midst of the chaos, the human and the demon exchanged a glance.</p><p>Feng Shangshi snorted coldly, ignoring the frog-fish, preparing to subdue the person in white first, lest he have any other tricks up his sleeve.  Delaying would only invite unforeseen complications.</p>
