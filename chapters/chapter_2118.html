<h1>Chapter 2108 Breakthrough</h1><p>Chapter 790 Breakthrough</p><p>Qin Sang had never had a true Master.  The one who had guided him the most was Yun Youzi, a friend and mentor, but after Qin Sang was transported to the Canglang Sea, they were separated by vast distances and hadn't seen each other for decades.</p><p>Especially in the way of the sword, Qin Sang had always explored on his own. When had he ever encountered such a dedicated teacher?  Every time, they could pinpoint his weakest areas with precision.</p><p>Thanks to his cultivation technique, Qin Sang had independently grasped the Sword Energy Resonance, but due to the lack of guidance, the process was long, and his comprehension of Sword Light Splitting had been slow.</p><p>However, the lengthy process wasn't without its benefits. Without this experience, he wouldn't be improving so rapidly now.  Encountering a renowned teacher now could be considered a late bloomer's surge.</p><p>Qin Sang once again entered the passage, not yet fully recovered.  Swords and blades are merciless. Those swordsmen wouldn't kill him, but injuries were inevitable, especially during the final battles, which had left several sword wounds on him.</p><p>He consumed a medicinal pill, suppressing his injuries, and walked in without looking back. This was a rare opportunity, and time was limited. He had to comprehend as much as possible before the Seven Killing Hall closed.</p><p>Stepping back into the passage, the familiar azure light descended, and the swordsman appeared.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang was experienced.  He wasn't in a hurry to defeat the swordsman, but instead, he eliminated all distracting thoughts, forgot everything, and comprehended the sword within the battle.</p><p>Defeated again and again, he returned to the passage again and again.</p><p>The wounds on Qin Sang's body increased, but he disregarded them, wiped away the blood, swallowed a medicinal pill, and plunged back into the passage, absorbing everything voraciously.</p><p>His swordsmanship realm was rapidly ascending.</p><p>Now, his sword strikes were no longer limited to any particular sword technique. He could act as he pleased, his heart guiding his hand, employing the most suitable moves. He had finally entered the threshold of true sword mastery.</p><p>If he were willing to dedicate himself to research, he had the potential to create his own sword techniques.</p><p>Previously, he could only use Sword Energy Resonance as a surprise attack, lacking versatility. Now, having advanced further, his flying sword became unpredictable, making his opponents run for their lives.</p><p>These weren't the most exhilarating things for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly feel himself getting closer and closer to Sword Light Splitting!</p><p>…</p><p>"Hahaha…"</p><p>Sudden, unrestrained laughter echoed within the passage.</p><p>Qin Sang stood tall at the entrance, the Ebony Sword floating before him.</p><p>Following Qin Sang's thoughts, the Ebony Sword trembled slightly, splitting off a beam of sword light. But then, another illusory sword shadow slowly materialized!</p><p>This flickering sword shadow was the nascent form of Sword Light Splitting!</p><p>"As long as I don't compare myself to a monster like Senior Qing Zhu, my talent isn't too bad!  Even among those Core Formation realm sword cultivators, only a few have grasped Sword Light Splitting…"</p><p>A slight smile played on Qin Sang's lips.</p><p>He hadn't expected that, after countless battles, a flash of inspiration would lead him to comprehend Sword Light Splitting on the spot.</p><p>However, he knew clearly that while the swordsmen contributed to his significant progress, it was also inseparable from the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter."</p><p>Although it was just a rudimentary sword shadow, every beginning is difficult. Qin Sang believed that it wouldn't be long before he could split off true sword light and, with just the sword in his hand, perhaps even challenge opponents of higher realms!</p><p>Legend had it that apex sword cultivators could face ten thousand enemies.</p><p>One sword out, ten thousand swords born!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have such grand ambitions. As long as his strength increased, he would be satisfied.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the Ebony Sword and looked confidently toward the depths of the passage.</p><p>He could now easily defeat the version of himself who had first entered.</p><p>Within the passage, he could definitely go further.</p><p>This time, he didn't rush into action.  Sitting cross-legged, he circulated his cultivation technique, focusing on healing his wounds and regulating his breath, adjusting his state to its peak. His gaze deepened as he entered the passage once more.</p><p>Opponents he had previously found difficult were no longer a major problem.</p><p>Qin Sang smoothly reached the furthest point he had reached before, effortlessly defeating the swordsman. Glancing at the spot where he had been defeated previously, he strode forward.</p><p>But soon Qin Sang encountered trouble.</p><p>The swordsmen were also growing, their strength increasing.</p><p>Later on, every battle was a fierce struggle.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze remained resolute, fixed on the end of the passage. He pressed forward step by step, pouring all his strength into confronting the swordsmen.</p><p>Finally… he saw the scene at the end of the passage.</p><p>There was no stone gate, no altar. Instead, there was a stone staircase leading upwards. The light was dim, revealing only four steps, polished to an extraordinary smoothness.</p><p>Qin Sang gave up resisting and was transported back to the passage entrance.  Gazing into the darkness, he fell into deep thought.</p><p>He was curious about where the staircase led. Regardless of what was inside, he had to go there. Even if there was no teleportation formation, it was definitely related to the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter."</p><p>Then he glanced at the place where Senior Qing Zhu had left the jade slip.</p><p>"If the staircase leads to an ancient teleportation formation, could Senior Qing Zhu have already returned to the Small Cold Realm?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, unsure.</p><p>Because he didn't understand Qing Zhu's life story, he could only rely on guesswork.  If he could find information about Senior Qing Zhu's experiences through Spirit Turtle Island, it might be helpful.</p><p>Currently, it was clearly impossible to break through.</p><p>Qin Sang had exerted all his strength and only made it halfway. He silently calculated that the final guardian swordsman should be comparable to a peak Late Core Formation cultivator, and possessing top-tier sword techniques, its battle prowess was extremely formidable.</p><p>He would need to face two peak experts at once.</p><p>This posed a dilemma for Qin Sang.  He understood the swordsmen's strength.  Even if he successfully broke through to the peak of Late Core Formation before his next entry, his chances of winning were slim.</p><p>Moreover, he still didn't know how to solve the Ebony Sword's problem, and his cultivation could stagnate at any time.</p><p>"Wait…"</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something and hurriedly retrieved a jade slip, the one left by Senior Qing Zhu.</p><p>He looked at the demonic art, "Seed Primordial Demonic Fetus," a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>Could there be a deeper meaning behind Senior Qing Zhu specifically leaving behind this secret technique?</p><p>The Demonic Seed for the External Avatar was refined from a sword soul, and the passage's restrictions didn't seal the Ebony Sword. Could it be because of the sword soul that the External Avatar could enter?</p><p>If he brought a Late Core Formation External Avatar, he would have a decent chance of winning.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang immediately made his decision.</p><p>Regardless of the odds, it was worth a gamble.  Refining an External Avatar wouldn't harm him. Even if his guess was wrong, he would gain a powerful combat asset.</p><p>He lingered in the passage for a while longer, finally bowing towards it as a gesture of thanks to the swordsmen's guidance.</p><p>"A single sword path has brought me such great fortune, allowing me to comprehend Sword Light Splitting… Ancient cultivators, the Seven Killing Hall…"</p><p>Qin Sang walked out, gazing up at the stone wall with boundless yearning.</p><p>Looking around, he wasn't sure where to go for a moment.</p><p>The gains from this trip were considerable. Although he hadn't found the teleportation formation, discovering the clues left by Senior Qing Zhu and finding this passage, which might lead to the teleportation formation, was enough to be exhilarating.</p><p>Qin Sang took out his jade token and checked, realizing he had spent too much time comprehending the sword within the passage. It was almost time to leave.</p><p>In such a short time, finding anything in the Celestial Tower was practically impossible.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
