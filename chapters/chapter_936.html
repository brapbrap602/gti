<h1>Chapter 928: Old Devil Fang</h1><p>Qin Sang quickly put this small episode behind him as he drew closer to Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>This time, he arrived a bit earlier.</p><p>It was said that because the Immortal Array was constantly changing, the Wu Clan's method of breaking the array this time was different from the last, and there might be a chance to observe it.</p><p>As the wind and waves grew stronger, Qin Sang knew that Seven Kills Palace was near.  He flew out not much farther, and his eyes brightened as the enormous sea pit and wind wall appeared before him, still as awe-inspiring as ever.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at them, then swept his gaze around, surprised to find only two figures nearby.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priest and other Nascent Soul cultivators were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>After a brief pause, Qin Sang retreated a little, then flew around the wind wall in other directions.</p><p>Just as he was about to reach the other side of the sea pit, Qin Sang stopped abruptly, a look of astonishment on his face. Ahead, there were more than ten cultivators, standing close together, intently watching something.</p><p>No wonder there were so few people elsewhere; they had all gathered here.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment, then put away his Ebony Sword and took out an ordinary flying sword, using swordsmanship for protection. He had too many enemies, all from powerful factions, and didn't want anyone to connect him to his true identity.</p><p>Previously, when he went to see Old Zou, he had also left the Celestial Corpse Coffin and his avatar elsewhere.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang cut through the wind and waves, flying to a spot not far from the group.</p><p>The others glanced at Qin Sang, then turned their attention back to what they were watching.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang also saw the scene before them.</p><p>In front of the wind wall, for some unknown reason, it was unusually calm. The hurricane seemed to be blocked by some force, unable to intrude into this area, always skirting around the edges.</p><p>Such a place was unique within the storm belt. At this moment, some cultivators were hovering there, clearly divided into two sides, each with more than ten people.</p><p>“The Wu Clan and human Nascent Soul cultivators!”</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted as he realized with astonishment that each of those figures possessed an alarmingly powerful aura. Without exception, they were all Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>“They arrived long ago. The wind and waves are calm there. Is it the power of a spirit array?”</p><p>Qin Sang wondered to himself, his gaze sweeping over these Nascent Soul cultivators and fixing on the sea below.  Even powerful Nascent Soul cultivators wouldn't dare be careless in the face of the gray hurricane; only a powerful spirit array could achieve such calmness.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he noticed countless white specks floating beneath the sea surface. “Those white specks are manifestations of the spirit array's power. The one controlling the spirit array should be the Wu Clan's Grand Witch Priest, a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.”</p><p>He had long admired the Grand Witch Priest.  He shifted his gaze towards the Wu Clan Nascent Soul cultivators and easily found a white-haired woman surrounded by others.</p><p>The woman wore a magnificent robe, the patterns on which resembled divine runes.  She wore a half-mask, thin as a cicada's wing, also inscribed with mysterious patterns.</p><p>Her red lips were full and vibrant, and her eyes were extremely spirited, as if they could capture one's soul.</p><p>All signs indicated that this woman was the Grand Witch Priest.</p><p>“White hair, yet skin like a young girl. It's hard to tell her age, but she's definitely an old monster.” Qin Sang didn't dare stare at the Grand Witch Priest.  He shifted his gaze to the human camp.</p><p>Daring to confront the Grand Witch Priest, the human side's strength shouldn't be too inferior. Last time, the Demon Lord himself came…</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred slightly. He immediately spotted an old Taoist priest holding a horsetail whisk, his eyes slightly closed, his demeanor otherworldly, as if indifferent to everything.</p><p>The old Taoist wore a moon-white robe, imprinted with two ancient seal characters: "Heavenly Dao."</p><p>“Could this be Heavenly Dao Sect's Sect Master, Ling Zhuzi? His aura is no less than the Grand Witch Priest's. Truly worthy of his reputation!”</p><p>Qin Sang had been in the Canglang Sea for a while and had some understanding of the major human factions.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi was another late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator among humans, a leading figure of the righteous path, as famous as the Demon Lord.</p><p>Some of the other human Nascent Soul cultivators surrounded Ling Zhuzi, while others deliberately kept a distance, seemingly keeping him at arm's length.</p><p>“Those people should be Demonic Path Nascent Soul cultivators. It seems the Demon Lord didn't come this time. Are the two great cultivators taking turns attending to the Wu Clan?”</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang guessed part of the story.</p><p>At this moment, the Nascent Soul grandmasters of both clans were gathered here, yet they remained silent and made no movements, as if waiting for a specific moment.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others naturally didn't dare to urge them, obediently staying on the periphery.</p><p>Unable to tell the time within the storm, Qin Sang estimated it was already the戌 hour . In a little over an hour, the Grand Witch Priest would use the array to break the array.</p><p>As time passed, more and more cultivators arrived. Qin Sang kept observing secretly, but he didn't see Old Zou and the others.  He wondered if they were concealing their identities.</p><p>Not all the Nascent Soul cultivators were dozing; some occasionally glanced at the Golden Core cultivators outside.</p><p>“What? Old Devil Mou, are you looking for someone?”</p><p>Several Demonic Path Nascent Soul cultivators stood together. Without the Demon Lord's backing, they were very low-key in the face of the two great cultivators.</p><p>One of the blood-robed elders suddenly opened his eyes and looked sideways at a black-robed demonic cultivator beside him, noticing that this person's behavior seemed somewhat unusual.</p><p>Old Devil Mou chuckled and evaded the question. “Old Ghost Blood, you're still so nosy.  This time, Lord Demon Lord isn't here. You'd better be careful, don't fall into the old bull-nose's hands."</p><p>The blood-robed elder appeared unconcerned. “The Wu Clan is the common enemy of our human race. How could Fellow Daoist Ling Zhuzi be so unreasonable?”</p><p>Despite his words, a trace of seriousness flashed in the blood-robed elder's eyes.</p><p>Old Devil Mou opened his mouth, wanting to say something more.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi abruptly opened his eyes and turned his head to look beyond the space, divine light flickering in his eyes.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators were startled and followed Ling Zhuzi's gaze, but they only saw the chaotic storm.</p><p>Just as they were puzzled, they suddenly heard a sharp cicada's cry.</p><p>The sound was exceptionally rapid, initially very faint, but amidst the earth-shattering roar of the wind and waves, it could clearly reach everyone's ears.</p><p>“Withered Leaf Cicada, it’s Old Devil Fang!”</p><p>“It's him! How did this old monster come?”</p><p>Hearing the cicada's cry, the human Nascent Soul cultivators' expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Even Ling Zhuzi revealed a grave expression.</p><p>On the other hand, the Wu Clan cultivators all had hints of joy on their faces, as if the newcomer was a powerful reinforcement.</p><p>The cicada's cry grew louder and louder, as if it could drown out the wind and waves. Wave after wave entered their ears, seemingly impacting their minds and making them unusually irritable.</p><p>A moment later, a gust of wind suddenly broke through the wind and waves. The cicada's cry reached its peak, and the Golden Core cultivators, affected by it, all looked somewhat strange.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The gust of wind rushed into the calm space and quickly dissipated, revealing its true form.</p><p>Someone gasped, their face full of disbelief.</p><p>The newcomer was not a cultivator, but a spirit cicada the size of a fist!</p><p>This cicada's wings resembled withered leaves. Cultivators familiar with spirit insects could recognize at a glance that this was a legendary rare insect, the Withered Leaf Cicada!</p><p>The Withered Leaf Cicada appeared, its two pupils shining with the light of intelligence, as if containing a human soul within, extremely eerie.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priest flashed towards the Withered Leaf Cicada, her voice filled with pleasant surprise. “Fellow Daoist Fang, I didn’t expect you to come as well.”</p>
