<h1>Chapter 831: External Avatar</h1><p>Chapter 831: External Avatar</p><p>Returning to his cave abode, Qin Sang subtly focused his mind.</p><p>His external avatar emerged.</p><p>“Fellow cultivator, you’re back.”</p><p>The avatar bowed, indistinguishable from a real person; it was almost impossible to detect any flaws.</p><p>Each time Qin Sang saw his avatar’s actions, he felt a subconscious sense of alertness.</p><p>According to the *Seed-Yuan Demon Embryo* secret technique, once the external avatar also breaks through to the Nascent Soul stage, the cultivator would possess a second Nascent Soul, essentially gaining a second life.</p><p>If the main body were to perish, resurrection could be achieved through the external avatar.</p><p>However, this transformation process demands an immense, almost unbearable cost.</p><p>During the process of occupying the external avatar and transforming into a second Nascent Soul, the cultivator would experience extreme weakness for a prolonged period, at least a century. If a tribulation were to strike during this time, there would be no means of defense.</p><p>Furthermore, the subsequent cultivation path would be fraught with difficulties, every step a struggle.</p><p>But it's still better than death.</p><p>Qin Sang was still unsure whether this effect remained after Senior Qingzhu’s modifications to the technique.</p><p>This interchange between the main body and the avatar filled Qin Sang with a sense of absurdity.  Which one is truly *me*? If the avatar were to backfire, wouldn't that be equivalent to me killing myself?</p><p>The *Seed-Yuan Demon Embryo* explicitly states that the higher the external avatar’s cultivation, the greater the risk of backfire; the avatar seizing control is not impossible. Cultivators must exercise extreme caution.</p><p>Therefore, when refining the external avatar, one could integrate its emotions; but Qin Sang chose not to, severing the memory of the split soul to minimize the connection between himself and the avatar.</p><p>Besides, he still had a long way to go before forming a Nascent Soul.</p><p>The avatar forming its Nascent Soul would be even more difficult, the odds extremely slim.  A second Nascent Soul was a distant prospect, and Qin Sang wouldn't risk himself for such a nebulous hope.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the avatar.</p><p>The demon embryo hadn't yet matured; it would still take some time. He ordered his avatar to cultivate alone in the cave dwelling, forbidding it from leaving and instructing it to set up a restrictive barrier.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang prepared for his departure, spending time helping the avatar refine its cultivation before dawn.</p><p>He sealed his cave and went to see Madam Liu.</p><p>…</p><p>The shopkeeper led Qin Sang into the back room. Madam Liu, upon seeing him, visibly relaxed.</p><p>She had clearly been worried that Qin Sang would change his mind.</p><p>“Master Daoist, you’ve finally arrived!”</p><p>Madam Liu stood up, saying repeatedly, “Master Daoist, is there anything else you wish to purchase? If not, let’s set off.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, then frowned suddenly. “Madam Liu, have you been moving about using your true appearance?”</p><p>“Of course not!”</p><p>Madam Liu smiled slightly, producing a mask thin as a cicada's wing. Upon putting it on, her face instantly transformed into another, even her demeanor subtly altered.</p><p>“This mask was lent to me by my husband’s old friend.  Thankfully, I have this treasure, allowing me to track Xiang Yi without being discovered.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised; the mask was clearly a magic artifact. After Madam Liu put it on, he could not detect any flaws, though it appeared to have no other functions.</p><p>Creating a magic artifact solely to change one's appearance was certainly extravagant.</p><p>However, when Qin Sang secretly activated his Sky-Eye Butterfly to use its celestial eye, he noticed a slight unnaturalness in her features; clearly, the artifact’s capabilities were limited.</p><p>He naturally didn't reveal this.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly’s abilities were unparalleled; the mask was sufficient to deceive Xiang Yi.</p><p>The two, having altered their appearances, journeyed towards the sacred mountain with the teleportation array. Arriving at the teleportation hall, they found that far fewer people were leaving than entering.</p><p>This scene made Qin Sang realize the escalating turmoil in the Demon Sea, and it even caused him to question his decision.</p><p>Upon learning of their destination, the cultivator in charge of the teleportation said, “Few cultivators are going to the Demon Sea right now.  You two will have to wait a while until we have enough people to activate the teleportation array.”</p><p>They bought a teleportation talisman and patiently waited, a long time passing before enough people gathered.</p><p>…</p><p>The salty, pungent sea breeze filled their nostrils, carrying a faint scent of demonic energy and blood.</p><p>Returning to the Desolate Island, Qin Sang immediately sensed a heavier atmosphere.</p><p>A long queue formed outside the teleportation hall leading back to the Canglang Sea—all cultivators who could afford the teleportation fee.  Many other cultivators and commoners waited there, facing an uncertain fate.</p><p>The harbor was packed with ships, bustling with activity, necessitating traveling in groups.</p><p>Fortunately, after finding a ship, they didn't have to pay fare; instead, the captain offered them spirit stones, requesting their aid in times of danger.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a palpable sense of fear and anxiety throughout the Demon Sea.  Even the Liu couple, frequent travelers to the Demon Sea, had never witnessed such a scene.</p><p>Madam Liu had prepared two sets of identities beforehand. Qin Sang and Madam Liu, well-disguised, discreetly boarded the ship.</p><p>The ship sailed across the sea.</p><p>Qin Sang and other cultivators chatted, learning about the situation in the Demon Sea. They discovered that the Yuan Ying Grandmasters who controlled the islands were uniting, agreeing to jointly resist the beast tide while also recruiting experts.</p><p>Many powerful cultivators who had remained hidden were unable to continue their seclusion and appeared, joining forces against the demon race.</p><p>The two island masters who had previously abandoned their islands weren't powerless; they had strategically retreated.  With reinforcements and assistance from various factions, they planned to assemble experts, relying on larger islands to withstand the demons.</p><p>"This isn't the barbaric age anymore.  So many powerful cultivators have entered the Demon Sea.  Various factions have vested interests here, and have invested heavily. We won't let the demons destroy it easily."</p><p>This cultivator was confident, ready to take risks for potential gain.</p><p>Qin Sang found this reasoning sound.  The overt factions—the righteous and demonic paths, the Three Great Merchant Alliances, and the Witch Clan—all highly valued the Demon Sea's resources.  For the Three Great Merchant Alliances and the Witch Clan, the Demon Sea represented their future.</p><p>The destruction of their foundations in the Demon Sea would be an unbearable loss; they would undoubtedly defend crucial locations with all their might.</p><p>The demon race was powerful, but not strong enough to completely wipe out the human and witch clans.</p><p>Of course, the demon race's actions were undeniable, and no one dared to underestimate the threat; everyone was on high alert.</p><p>Along the way, the fleet frequently encountered demon beast attacks. While slaying the beasts, Qin Sang unexpectedly befriended a female cultivator from another ship, hailing from Huntian Island.</p><p>"I spent some time on Huntian Island. I remember it was not long after the Witch Uprising ended. There were rumors of celestial fire appearing outside the island, heralding the emergence of a Yuan Ying artifact.  Is this true? And who obtained the treasure?" Qin Sang asked quickly.</p><p>Unsure of the extent of the disturbance caused by the Winter冥 Cold Flame, he answered vaguely.</p><p>The female cultivator looked at Qin Sang in surprise.  "You're well-informed. I only heard rumors afterwards.  They say that the remains of Elder Dongming were discovered, and his divine ability, the Winter冥 Cold Flame, emerged along with treasures from his cave abode.  Finally, the island master summoned the old demon Mu Lue to subdue the flame, and the treasures presumably fell into their hands."</p>
