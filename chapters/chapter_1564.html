<h1>Chapter 1555: Watching the Storm</h1><p>The visit from Elder Leng was only the beginning.</p><p>Over the following period, several more Yuan Ying cultivators arrived.  Regardless of their background, Qin Sang merely met with them briefly, then, using the excuse of needing to recuperate, went into seclusion. He instructed Zhou Ruan and his wife to take the visitors to the backyard to question Lan Jiao.</p><p>Some even tried to buy Lan Jiao.</p><p>Zhou Ruan and his wife had never encountered such a situation. Initially, they were terrified, but eventually, they managed to remain calm after receiving several Yuan Ying guests.</p><p>One day,</p><p>Zhou Ruan and his wife were guarding the main hall, betting on whether more Yuan Ying cultivators would arrive that day.  The door to Qin Sang's room suddenly opened. Qin Sang emerged, and seeing the couple hastily stand, instructed them, "Pack your things. We're leaving the Chi Nan Archipelago."</p><p>Zhou Jin froze. "Senior Qin, just the three of us to the outer sea?"</p><p>They had been closely monitoring the situation on the island. Ever since news of the powerful demonic beast spread, the Chi Nan Archipelago had been on high alert, and low-level cultivators no longer dared venture into the outer sea.  The archipelago was now teeming with various factions.  It was said that the Yuan Ying masters were moving mysteriously, discussing some plan.  Qin Sang had publicly claimed to be injured by the transformed demonic beast and was feigning illness to avoid involvement with the current forces on the island. Zhou Jin assumed that Qin Sang had other allies, but so far, none had appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "Not the outer sea. We're going home."</p><p>"Going home now? What about the ancient immortal sect's ruins...?"</p><p>Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu were astonished, completely unprepared for this outcome. The Chi Nan Archipelago was in turmoil, with powerful figures from both races arriving, clearly indicating that something major was about to happen, and the legends might indeed be true. Senior Qin was perfectly capable of seizing a share of the spoils, yet he was choosing to withdraw.</p><p>"What immortal sect? Is there a chance to reach the level of a Transcendent?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, turned, and walked towards the backyard, leaving the speechless couple staring after him.</p><p>It started with the appearance of the Demon King.  Back in the Chi Nan Archipelago, Elder Leng's nighttime visit revealed a mysterious Gu God Sect.  Even then, Qin Sang sensed something amiss; he suspected it wasn't just about the so-called ancient immortal sect. He even thought the legend itself had been deliberately spread. He'd stumbled into this situation quite by accident.</p><p>During this time, the Chi Nan Archipelago was a chaotic mix of hidden currents and intrigue. Qin Sang openly kept Lan Jiao in the pond, hoping to lure out the enemy with news of the Demon King, but still couldn't untangle the threads or discern the hidden machinations behind it all.  He had no desire to be a pawn in someone else's game or be drawn into a dangerous vortex.</p><p>Since he couldn't see clearly, he decided to remove himself from the situation! His breakthrough was imminent.  Inaction was preferable to action.  Even if there were ancient immortal sect ruins nearby, the possibility of finding a Transcendent-level opportunity was extremely low, especially as the legends remained unproven.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang wouldn't leave for too long; he planned to find a place to settle down and wait and see.  Once the situation in the Chi Nan Archipelago became clearer, or he received definite news, he would decide whether to contact his main body or make a move.</p><p>Zhou Ruan and his wife, not understanding the subtleties, obeyed his orders, quickly packed their things, and followed Qin Sang to the backyard.</p><p>In the pond,</p><p>Lan Jiao, reduced to the size of a carp, floated motionless on the surface, its belly up, eyes glazed over, lifeless. Qin Sang’s use of it to entertain the Yuan Ying cultivators had left Lan Jiao severely wounded, only barely alive, both mentally and physically.</p><p>Finally seeing Qin Sang,</p><p>A spark of life flickered in Lan Jiao's dull eyes. It struggled to flip over, summoning its remaining strength to swim to the shore, its cry pitiful, "Master, spare me! Master, spare me!"</p><p>Qin Sang approached the edge of the pond, looked down at Lan Jiao, and pointed at Zhou Jin. "I want you to pledge allegiance to him. Do you agree?"</p><p>If it were to pledge allegiance to Qin Sang, Lan Jiao wouldn't hesitate.  But this person...</p><p>Lan Jiao sighed; the situation left it no choice but to nod in agreement.</p><p>Qin Sang said to Zhou Jin, "Take it back. Let it be the guardian spirit beast of Loutai Pavilion."</p><p>Zhou Jin never expected such a reward. Ruan Yu received pills from Elder Leng, and he, a demon core-stage spirit beast.</p><p>Being close to a big tree certainly offered shade! Following Senior Qin really did bring good fortune.</p><p>Zhou Jin happily subdued Lan Jiao and made a promise, "Daoist Lan Jiao, from now on, we will treat each other as equals. If you can transform, Loutai Pavilion will set you free."</p><p>Lan Jiao felt a little better.</p><p>After paying their bill, they left the market town, heading to the west coast of the Chi Nan Archipelago. They summoned their flying artifact and soared into the sky.</p><p>...</p><p>Within the market town,</p><p>A secluded courtyard.  The best location in the entire town.  Pavilions and towers, quiet and elegant.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>The door was pushed open from the outside. Leng Qi hurried into the small courtyard, head slightly bowed, his manner respectful. He quickly walked to the main hall.  "Master, Senior Qin and the Zhou couple have left the market town, reportedly heading west."</p><p>Inside the hall,</p><p>Elder Leng was playing a game with someone.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>Elder Leng placed a white piece on the board.</p><p>The other person was completely shrouded in a black robe, their face completely hidden.  Holding a black piece, their hand was as delicate as a young boy's, yet their voice was very old and calm. "Since they've left, perhaps it's a coincidence, not people of the same path."</p><p>Elder Leng gazed at the board, pondering for a moment before shaking his head slightly. "They're clever; we might be able to win them over...  Oh well, the time isn't right, no need to rush."</p><p>The person in black robe hummed. "Those who arrived first are the most concerned about the missing Nascent Soul cultivator. We must carefully distinguish between friend and foe."</p><p>Elder Leng fingered a piece, hesitating. "The Eight Views Sect and the Ganlu Zen Monastery haven't made a move. If a Nascent Soul cultivator disappeared, they should be the most worried."</p><p>The person in black robe chuckled.  "Those at the top of the Buddhist and Daoist sects always maintain a certain composure! The demon tribe's movements are interesting; the Demon King appearing so quickly is an unexpected gain. The missing Nascent Soul cultivator seems not to be an isolated incident. If we can confirm that the Demon King is also missing, it would explain a lot.  How many years has it been since we last heard from that old demon from the Northern Wasteland's Luye region? People have almost forgotten about him. Unfortunately, Luye Plain is secluded and its location shifts, and we've never seen a successor emerge! Even if these old fellows can return, if we seize this opportunity, it'll be enough for us to act…"</p><p>Elder Leng nodded.</p><p>The two fell silent, the only sound in the hall being the gentle click of pieces on the board.</p><p>Leng Qi waited outside for a while before quietly leaving.</p><p>…</p><p>The open sea.</p><p>The sun shone brightly, the sea calm and still.</p><p>Suddenly, waves rose, a white line appearing on the horizon, shooting towards them at an incredible speed – a handsome young man in ornate armor and fine robes.</p><p>Then, a pair of white wings, large as a crane's plumage, unfurled behind him.  With a gentle flap, his speed increased dramatically, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>He arrived at an unfamiliar sea area.</p><p>Circling briefly, he retracted his wings, parting the water to enter the ocean depths. Soon he saw a crystal palace suspended in the sea.</p><p>Several Azure Sharks circled the palace.</p><p>Upon seeing the youth, they initially showed apprehension, before quickly prostrating themselves, trembling.</p><p>The youth flew directly to the palace gate and knocked forcefully, a mischievous smile spreading across his face. "Old Monster Fish, I hear you met a tough opponent and got the short end of the stick?"</p><p>An angry snort came from within.</p><p>The palace gate silently opened, and the youth entered, seeing the Sea-巡海夜叉 (Night Fork, a type of water demon) looking glum. He laughed even harder.  "I warned you not to be so arrogant. Did you really think humanity couldn't control you? If you end up as a mountain-guarding spirit beast, no one can save you."</p><p>"You feathered wretch, you only came to laugh at me?"</p><p>The Sea-巡海夜叉 raged. "I only saw many Golden Core cultivators on that ship, tender and delicious, and acted on impulse. Who knew a Yuan Ying cultivator was hiding? You tricked me into coming here for that nonsense about the ancient Immortal Sect? What treasures could possibly be in a human ruin?"</p><p>The youth stopped joking, his eyes gleaming. "Old Monster Fish, think about it – an ancient Immortal Sect built in this location, it couldn't have avoided interacting with my race. Legend has it that our ancestors suffered greatly, countless elders enslaved by the Immortal Palace. Surely there are treasures in the ruins. This time, friends from the Saint King Palace will also be present. Don't blame me for not warning you, control your temper, don't ruin things."</p><p>"Saint King Palace?"</p><p>The Sea-巡海夜叉 was both surprised and delighted. "An order from the Saint King?"</p><p>The youth shook his head, refusing to answer.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang left the Chi Nan island chain, escaping the fray.</p><p>He traveled west with the Zhou couple, stopping at an island with a market town once they felt the time was right.</p><p>Qin Sang remained secluded.</p><p>The Zhou couple moved around the area, gathering information.</p><p>It might not be immediate, but allows for reflection.</p><p>The Chi Nan island chain first saw legends of the ancient Immortal Sect emerge, then the appearance of the Demon King.  These signs highlighted its unusual nature, gradually fermenting over time.</p><p>News spread.</p><p>Yuan Ying cultivators frequently appeared in the Chi Nan island chain.</p><p>In the open sea, the demon tribe's activity became increasingly frequent, even resulting in beast tides.</p><p>At first, both sides maintained restraint, tacitly keeping their distance, searching repeatedly in their respective territories.</p><p>Later, both sides gained nothing and had to explore outwards, inevitably encroaching on each other's territory. Friction gradually increased, and reports of Yuan Ying cultivators and Yao Wangs battling each other became commonplace.</p><p>During this time, someone unearthed ancient texts of unknown age, confirming the existence of a powerful force called Wuwang Palace near the southern island chain, fueling even greater enthusiasm.</p><p>This chaos continued for a long time without resolution. The waters around the southern island chain were searched thoroughly, time and again, yet no ancient sect relics were ever found.</p><p>As enthusiasm waned, the grand treasure hunt fizzled out. The behind-the-scenes maneuvering seemed rather laughable and pointless.</p><p>Fortunately, the leaders of both races remained clear-headed and didn't resort to large-scale conflict based on unfounded rumors, avoiding a devastating war.</p><p>Qin Sang observed it all, feeling like a farcical fiasco, baffling and confusing to an outsider. There was no trace of the imagined mastermind, suggesting a simple treasure hunt. Upon learning about Wuwang Palace, he even considered summoning his main body.</p><p>After the commotion, the southern island chain struggled to regain its former tranquility.  Wuwang Palace had indeed existed.</p><p>Some cultivators lingered, while others arrived, each believing themselves blessed with good fortune, capable of discovering Wuwang Palace's remains.</p><p>Once it was certain that various factions were withdrawing, and beast tides were becoming infrequent, with most of the demon race returning to the deep sea, Qin Sang decided it was time to leave.</p><p>He committed the names of the Gu Shen Jiao and Old Cold to memory.  Perhaps the ripple effects of this treasure hunt would only become clear much later.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang planned to return to Fuyu County, Zhou Ruan and his wife brought back an unexpected guest.</p><p>Inside the quiet chamber, a swirling white mist gathered above Qin Sang's head, resembling a celebratory cloud formed from Xuan Qi energy. He was practicing the Xuan Tian Yi Qi Da Qin Na Hand technique.</p><p>The Xuan Qi energy condensed and dispersed, morphing into various shapes. Each change caused imperceptible tremors in the surrounding void, all under his perfect control.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang remained uninvolved, maintaining his cultivation diligently, making significant progress.</p><p>Sensing the commotion outside, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. The Xuan Qi cloud above him trembled, then abruptly retracted, the energy flowing back into his body and vanishing.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes, before opening the door.</p><p>"Daoist Lu!"</p><p>The one who had arrived with Zhou Ruan and his wife was none other than Lu Zhang from Bu Nian Mountain.</p><p>Lu Zhang nodded and quipped, "I heard that a mysterious expert skilled in ice-type techniques appeared at the southern island chain, repelling a Yao Wang with a single strike. I guessed it might be you. Experts with such abilities are rare in the Central Plains.  Later, I met Zhou Ruan and his wife... Why did you impersonate Daoist Qin? Weren't you worried he'd seek you out?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "After meeting Daoist Qin, I often impersonate him to deceive others.  I never imagined I'd meet you here, Daoist Lu. Please, have a seat."</p><p>Lu Zhang, completely unaware of their shared identity, nodded, settling down. "I came to the East Sea on a mission for my sect. Afterward, I heard about an ancient sect appearing at the southern island chain and came to join the fun.  Upon arrival, I found things suspicious and full of mysteries. You initially used an alias and later withdrew, suggesting you also sensed something amiss, correct?"</p><p>"Indeed."</p><p>Qin Sang needed someone to clarify things and recounted his recent experiences, asking gravely, "Daoist Lu, do you also believe there is something more to this?"</p><p>Lu Zhang nodded, "Knowing you were also involved, I was worried you might get entangled.  Fortunately, you withdrew; otherwise, you would have faced endless trouble.  The Eight Scenery and Ganlu Chan Yuan seem to be biding their time, but their intentions remain unclear. Officially, everyone gathered at the southern island chain was lured by Wuwang Palace.  However, some forces, previously hidden, are now openly active. Some are unknown to me, yet possess considerable strength."</p><p>Qin Sang added, "Like the Gu Shen Jiao?"</p><p>Lu Zhang hummed, "Claiming to be a 'Jiao' (sect) yet without any visible preaching is strange.  Perhaps the Gu Shen Jiao operates in remote areas, employing secretive and low-key proselytizing methods. However, any activity will leave traces. I'll send people to investigate upon returning to my sect."</p><p>The two exchanged their findings.  Insufficient information made a definitive conclusion impossible.</p><p>Lu Zhang bowed, changing the subject, "I have a matter requiring your assistance, Daoist."</p>
