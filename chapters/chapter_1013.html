<h1>Chapter 1005: The White Crane</h1><p>Qin Sang continued south, keeping a low profile.  He avoided using his abilities along the way, fearing that the demon clan would detect his presence and pursue him.  This cautious journey took several months.</p><p>He arrived at an unfamiliar sea area, feeling relatively safe. He found a deserted island to rest and recover before setting out again, searching for opponents.  He flew aimlessly for several days, finding no targets.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang’s ears twitched. He turned his head towards the distance, then vanished.</p><p>A cliff faced the sea. A cave was located high on the cliff face.  At the cave entrance, two figures were intertwined. Their identities were surprising: one was a kite bird with brilliantly colored feathers, looking like a rainbow phoenix from afar, the other a snow-white crane.</p><p>The crane was magnificent, pristine white.  Standing on one leg, taller than the kite bird, it gently preened the bird’s feathers with its beak and stroked its wings with a claw, softly guiding it into the cave. The kite bird nestled close, appearing languid and content.</p><p>Despite being different species, the affection between the two demon beasts was touching.</p><p>Then, a discordant note emerged. A piercing scream startled the pair. A green shadow descended from the sky, hurtling toward the cave. It was another kite bird, but larger and with green feathers.  While impressive, it was less majestic than the crane.</p><p>Witnessing the intimate scene within the cave, the green kite bird’s screams grew increasingly shrill, filled with furious rage.  The two birds inside were startled.  A chaotic scene ensued.</p><p>Seeing the green kite bird’s aggressive stance, the crane’s eyes widened in alarm.  It shuddered its wings, unceremoniously kicking the still-dazed kite bird away, then fled without looking back.</p><p>The narrow cave entrance caused the crane to stumble, nearly falling. The green kite bird arrived, screaming in fury, its talons slashing towards the crane’s eyes.</p><p>Though panicked, the crane reacted swiftly. It retracted its long neck, folding its wings, narrowly avoiding the attack.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A spray of white feathers erupted.  The green kite bird’s claw tore away a portion of the crane’s wing feathers. The crane shrieked, tumbling like a white ball against the cliff face before rebounding.</p><p>Fortunately, the crane’s feathers were quite tough. Though its wings were tattered, it wasn't seriously injured.</p><p>As the crane attempted to regain its balance, the green kite bird, consumed by fury at the perceived theft of its mate, wouldn’t let it go.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A flash of green light. The crane was forced to flee again.</p><p>The crane's defensive skills were impressive. Using its wings, it repeatedly blocked the green kite bird's attacks, protecting its vital areas with practiced ease.</p><p>Despite being chased and attacked for a long time, it only sustained superficial injuries. However, its once smooth, snow-white feathers were now in disarray, torn and ragged in many places. Its wing feathers were largely plucked out, leaving it looking like a bald crane.</p><p>Finally, the crane found an opening to counterattack, its powerful wings deflecting the green kite bird's talons. Then, with a shake of its wings, it turned and fled.</p><p>The green kite bird pursued relentlessly, but the crane, surprisingly adept at evasion, flapped its now featherless wings with incredible speed, quickly increasing the distance between them.  The chase was hopeless.</p><p>After escaping a safe distance, the crane stopped, turned, and performed a dance, emitting a series of crane calls toward the green kite bird, seeming rather smug.  Seeing the enraged green kite bird closing in, the crane ducked its head and fled again.</p><p>“What a jerk!” Qin Sang, who had been secretly observing the entire scene, muttered as he followed the two demon beasts, commenting on the crane's repeated taunting.</p><p>He hadn't expected to witness such a spectacle in the Demon Sea; it was unexpectedly entertaining.</p><p>The green kite bird, its revenge thwarted, returned. It was also a powerful demon beast in the Core Formation stage.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, feeling a little pity for the creature. Instead of attacking, she followed the fleeing crane.</p><p>The crane, having shaken off the kite, flapped its small, fleshy wings for a while before landing on a rocky beach.  Qin Sang followed, finding the crane staring at the water.</p><p>The crane meticulously preened its feathers, not missing a single downy plume; even the few remaining long feathers on its wings were carefully arranged. Then, standing on one leg, it circled, admiring its own supposed magnificence with a self-satisfied air.  However, its appearance was far from handsome.</p><p>After a moment, the crane took flight again. Qin Sang, curious about its destination, watched it go.  The crane hadn't consumed any Imperial Dew, but its earlier behavior suggested high intelligence and mid-stage Yao Dan cultivation.  On a whim, and having nothing better to do, Qin Sang chose not to reveal herself immediately, instead continuing to follow.</p><p>The crane was oblivious to the cultivator trailing it.  With unwavering purpose, it flew in a straight line for several days, arriving at a large island.  Approaching a mountain stealthily, it peered and watched cautiously for a while before emitting a series of cooing calls into the woods.</p><p>Shortly after, a smaller, beautiful bird emerged. The beautiful bird was reserved, alighting on a branch. The crane, spreading its rather unsightly wings, danced before the beautiful bird, emitting flattering calls. Despite its unappealing looks, its dance was surprisingly charming and skillfully performed.  The beautiful bird, far from being repulsed, was captivated and joined the dance.  The crane took advantage of the moment to get closer, clearly about to repeat its previous behavior.</p><p>"Another one!  Huh, it seems like this beautiful bird also has phoenix bloodline, just like that kite earlier. How many lovers does this fellow have?"  Hidden in the shadows, Qin Sang was speechless, then suddenly had an idea,  "Could this be..."</p><p>As this thought occurred to her, a piercing sound broke the air from a distance. The amorous pair separated abruptly, the beautiful bird hurrying back to its nest.</p><p>Despite this setback, the crane showed no discouragement, expertly escaping on the ground.</p><p>"Late-stage Yao Dan!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the approaching beast, her expression grave.  This island was no ordinary place; the presence of such a powerful beast on the outskirts indicated a dangerous area.</p><p>After escaping, the crane began darting around the island's perimeter, targeting even Yao Ling stage creatures. Qin Sang noticed that despite its vanity, the crane was quite picky.  Cultivation level was irrelevant, but phoenix bloodline was a must.  One ordinary bird, charmed by its dance, had tried to approach, only to be kicked away.</p><p>Unfortunately, its carefree days were numbered.  Qin Sang intercepted the crane as it was leaving the island.</p>
