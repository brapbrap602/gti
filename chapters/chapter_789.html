<h1>Chapter 781: Teleportation</h1><p>Chapter 781: Teleportation</p><p>Fifth Level…</p><p>Sixth Level…</p><p>They stormed through, reaching the sixth level in one go.</p><p>Emerging from the teleportation array, everyone's expressions turned grave.  If the Heavenly Tower was a trial ground, this level was clearly designed for cultivators at the late Core Formation stage. While they didn't have to face the siege of puppets in the teleportation hall, they could encounter surprise puppet attacks at any time while searching for the next array.</p><p>Thanks to their previous cooperation, they worked together seamlessly. The ancient temple grew larger with each level.  They fought off puppets while blindly searching in the darkness.</p><p>"Watch out below!"</p><p>An Yin-surname female cultivator sensed something, giving a sharp warning.</p><p>The others reacted swiftly. The old woman clasped her hands together.  Her bronze mirror vibrated, emitting a flickering yellow light, projecting a massive illusory shield that enveloped everyone.</p><p>Simultaneously, the small shields surrounding them split into five.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>The small shields shot downwards, each perfectly protecting a person. A double defense was instantly established.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the movements of the two magic treasures, confirming there were no gaps in their defense before withdrawing his gaze. He wouldn't entrust his life to others; if anything unexpected happened, he could summon his double-headed… (weapon name omitted for cultural adaptation).</p><p>At the same time, a Di-surname man suddenly flicked his sleeve. A crimson light shot out, striking below them with incredible speed.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A series of muffled sounds echoed. Several shadowy figures appeared simultaneously in the darkness.</p><p>These puppets were identical in appearance, resembling panthers, with long, slender bodies, clearly agile. From their paws to their heads, they were covered in black scales forming dense armor, including their eyes – closing their eyes provided perfect camouflage.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen similar scales on the puppets on the fifth level. They were extremely hard, but the scales on these panther puppets were significantly thicker and offered stronger defense.</p><p>The panther puppets' claws were embedded with razor-sharp nails.  Most strangely, they each had a single horn on their heads, crafted from some kind of black crystal, incredibly sharp and pointed.</p><p>These black puppets blended seamlessly with the darkness. They moved silently. Had the Yin-surname cultivator not noticed them in time, they would have been caught off guard.</p><p>The crimson light forced the panther puppets out of the shadows, but only slightly hindered their advance.  These puppets knew no pain.  They forcefully headbutted, shattering the crimson light, then silently lunged at them.</p><p>There were six puppets in total.</p><p>The bronze mirror swept out a yellow light, knocking one away.  A Wu-surname cultivator used their shield to engage another.  The Di-surname man and Qin Sang each dealt with two.</p><p>For a time, magical light shone everywhere, and true energy flew wildly.  The Yin-surname female cultivator kept her eyes fixed on the puppets, her gaze emitting strange light as she used a secret technique to find their weaknesses.</p><p>"Something's wrong!"</p><p>The Di-surname man seemed to have noticed something and his expression tightened.</p><p>At that moment, the panther puppets abandoned their attack and retreated.  Having never encountered such a situation, everyone was confused.  Just as they wondered what was happening, they saw the panther puppets gather together, their dark eyes fixed on them, without a flicker of emotion – incredibly eerie.</p><p>Then, they simultaneously aimed their horns at them.</p><p>*Crackle…*</p><p>The tips of the horns suddenly lit up, with lightning surging, gradually forming a ball of lightning.  Even more shockingly, the six lightning balls seemed to be merging.</p><p>Though the lightning balls were still forming, everyone felt the danger.  Being struck by them wouldn't be pleasant.</p><p>"We absolutely cannot let those lightning balls merge!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly, shouting urgently.  He immediately activated his ebony sword, unleashing the Sword Qi Thunder Sound, striking at one of the panther puppets.  The others realized the urgency and attacked with their magic treasures.</p><p>At that moment, the Yin-surname female cultivator's eyes lit up, finally making a discovery.  She exclaimed, "Their eyes are the weakness!  And both eyes must be struck simultaneously!"</p><p>"No wonder the previous attacks to the eyes were useless. So that's how it is…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred upon hearing this.  At the last moment, he changed his target.  His sword light, like a lightning bolt, bent in mid-air, striking directly at the panther puppet's head.  The sword light split into two, aiming for both eyes.</p><p>The Sword Qi Thunder Sound was incredibly fast. The panther puppet couldn't close its scales in time.  The ebony sword pierced both eyes easily.</p><p>The next moment, the panther puppet froze. The lightning ball on its horn silently dissipated, and its body crumbled like it had been weathered, turning into green sand scattered by the ebony sword.</p><p>Finally finding the weakness, everyone's spirits lifted, and they eagerly gave Qin Sang the opportunity to attack.</p><p>Soon, all six panther puppets were slain by Qin Sang's sword.</p><p>The old woman sighed, "In the sixth level, each puppet possesses unique abilities, and their weaknesses are increasingly concealed.  Their destructive power far surpasses the lower levels. If the main hall and the passage hadn't been destroyed, even if we joined forces, it would have been difficult for us to break through and find the teleportation array."</p><p>The man surnamed Di said with a relaxed expression, "Thanks to Daoist Yin's expertise in puppetry and Daoist Qin's superb swordsmanship, they are perfectly suited to deal with these puppets.  Choosing you two to work together was indeed the right choice. I expect those who entered before us are lagging behind. At our speed, we should be the first to arrive."</p><p>"Daoist Di, don't forget those Nascent Soul masters! And your Wu Clan ancestors, who have stormed in and probably turned the entire tower upside down.  I only hope they don't set their sights on the treasure I'm searching for."</p><p>The old woman poured cold water on their enthusiasm, her expression pessimistic.</p><p>Everyone's smiles faded, but they were helpless.</p><p>Only Qin Sang remained relaxed. He didn't covet treasure; the more the Nascent Soul masters unearthed, the better, as it would give him more clues to find what he sought.</p><p>The Nascent Soul masters loomed like a dark cloud over their heads.</p><p>Silence fell as they continued onward.</p><p>They encountered several more surprise puppet attacks, but managed to overcome them.</p><p>After a thorough search of the sixth level, they finally found the teleportation array!</p><p>In a desolate area, a three-tiered platform floated gently, inconspicuous amidst the ruins of the shattered hall.  Fortunately, the teleportation array on the platform remained intact.</p><p>"We found it!"</p><p>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, their faces lit up with joy as they eagerly flew towards the teleportation array.</p><p>"After we reach the next level, do any of you intend to continue cooperating?"</p><p>The female cultivator surnamed Yin suddenly asked.</p><p>To her disappointment, the old woman shook her head. "I would like to ask for your assistance, but the place I'm going requires a specific token for entry, and I only have one. I'm afraid we can no longer cooperate. Let's part ways here; perhaps we'll have another opportunity to work together in the future."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others echoed her sentiments.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh…'</p><p>Everyone darted towards the stone platform.</p><p>Unexpectedly,</p><p>As they reached the edge of the platform, the teleportation array lit up without warning, and a figure slowly materialized, appearing on the high platform.</p>
