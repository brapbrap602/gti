<h1>Chapter 1886: Summoning the Gods</h1><p>Western Dipper Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang, having fled here, was surprised to discover that two Star Lords' temples remained intact: those of Gao Yuan Star Lord and Huang Ling Star Lord.</p><p>The golden dragon pulled the divine palanquin into Gao Yuan Star Lord's temple and collapsed to the ground to recover.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Star Lord's statue, pondering escape routes while checking the palanquin's condition.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The black demonic peng was attacking the temple again.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the Western Dipper Star Lord's position was higher than the Twenty-eight Lunar Mansions Star Lords, and the spiritual light barrier was stronger.</p><p>The two Star Lords' temples were not far apart, giving him a much-needed respite.</p><p>“What path should I take next? If I continue circling outside with the demonic peng, talismans gods comparable to the Western Dipper Star Lord are too sparsely distributed.  I won’t be this lucky again, and the divine palanquin will be heavily burdened. If I flee towards the heart of the Purple Micro Enclosure, there are more high-level talisman gods, but…”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the scene from his escape.</p><p>He had paid close attention to the demons' movements, noticing how they scrambled to rush into the Heavenly Heavens, disappearing beyond the clouds. Clearly, something more alluring was there.</p><p>“They haven't targeted me. This means the black demonic peng's attack was opportunistic; it's a chance…”</p><p>…</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Under the demonic peng's relentless assault, the temple finally crumbled.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately urged the golden dragon, teleporting to the other Star Lord's temple.</p><p>Until the second temple was on the verge of collapse, Qin Sang escaped from the temple in the divine palanquin.</p><p>Amidst the sea of clouds and between immortal mountains, a golden light streaked towards the heart of the Purple Micro Enclosure.  Qin Sang had made his decision.</p><p>The black demonic peng guessed Qin Sang's intentions, its attacks growing even more ferocious.  It had been repeatedly thwarted by the temple barriers, fueling its burning rage. Yet, it remained helpless against the divine palanquin.</p><p>However, the demonic peng gradually realized that the palanquin was not invincible. During the chase, the golden dragon's phantom was becoming increasingly faint, a clear sign of the palanquin's weakening power.</p><p>If the pursuit continued, the palanquin and Qin Sang would inevitably fall into its clutches.</p><p>But Qin Sang was fleeing towards the Purple Micro Enclosure. Once he reached the temples of the legendary River Chart position, or even the supreme Talisman Gods of the Cave Truth position, the demonic peng had no confidence in breaking the temple barriers.  It had to stop him!</p><p>The black demonic peng's eyes burned red, unleashing a furious onslaught, leaving Qin Sang desperately dodging.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The divine palanquin entered an open area. As it sped along, Qin Sang's expression tightened. He felt a sudden sense of foreboding!</p><p>Without warning, the poison pearl in his dantian began to emit strange fluctuations.</p><p>“Poison here!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>He knew the Celestial Court had Plague Department Talisman Gods with some connection to the art of poison, but the talisman gods themselves were merely manifestations of talismans; unless activated, they wouldn't release poison on their own.</p><p>How could there be poison in the Celestial Court?</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang cultivated poison arts, his sensitivity to toxins far surpassing that of cultivators at his level. Yet, he hadn't detected the poison entering his body until the poison pearl reacted and began to operate on its own.</p><p>Based on the pearl’s reaction, the poison was not only exceptionally subtle but also extremely potent.</p><p>The poison continued to accumulate within his body. By the time Qin Sang noticed it fully, it would be a grave threat.</p><p>He cultivated poison essence, giving him some resistance to potent poisons, preventing immediate death. However, in this situation, even a slight delay in his teleportation due to the poison’s effects could land him in the demon king's hands!</p><p>“Another demon king!”</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Azure Scale demonic serpent; it was likely a venomous creature.</p><p>Only a demon king's poison arts could have masked their presence from his senses!</p><p>A demon king had laid a poison field ambush; thankfully, the poison pearl had detected it!</p><p>One demon king had him running for his life; how long could he last against two?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate, immediately urging the golden dragon to teleport out of the poison field.</p><p>In a flash of golden light, he had vanished from the area.</p><p>At the edge of the poison field, behind an immortal mountain, a soft gasp was heard.</p><p>The Azure Scale demonic serpent, at some point, had shrunk to the size of an ordinary python, hiding there.</p><p>Seeing the poison field easily detected, the Azure Scale demonic serpent was greatly surprised. Cold light flickered in its eyes as it watched the divine palanquin. Its forked tongue darted out, emitting a hissing sound, seemingly transmitting a signal.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>Behind another immortal mountain, a bright green light soared into the sky, revealing a powerfully built Golden Horned demonic ox.</p><p>The bright green aura enveloping the Golden Horned demonic ox had the same essence as the Azure Scale demonic serpent.</p><p>Even a lion hunting a rabbit must exert all its strength.</p><p>To ensure success, the Scaly Serpent used concealment magic before the ambush, hiding itself and the Bull Demon.  The Celestial Mountain temple obscured their presence, preventing the Sky-Eye Butterfly from detecting them.</p><p>The Golden Horned Bull Demon charged from behind the mountain. Instead of pursuing Qin Sang, it leaped into the air.  Circles of golden markings appeared on its horn, radiating a blinding golden light.</p><p>The horn seemed poised to pierce the heavens. The bull demon took a deep breath, its chest swelling dramatically.</p><p>With a resounding *dong*, a sound like thunder shook the earth.</p><p>This was no ordinary sound, but the Bull Demon's innate ability, the "Heart Drum," capable of shattering the enemy's spirit.  Those with weaker cultivation could even have their souls dispersed and die instantly.</p><p>The horn's tip pointed directly at the fleeing Divine Chariot, with nothing obstructing its path.  Qin Sang was in the direct line of attack.  The Golden Dragon could carry him away, but couldn't shield him.</p><p>As the Golden Horned Bull Demon attacked, the Scaly Serpent transformed into a streak of light, joining the Black Roc in a flanking assault on the chariot.</p><p>What followed greatly surprised the three demons.</p><p>Qin Sang sat on his throne, his back to them. Though shaken slightly by the Heart Drum attack, he was unharmed. He immediately activated the Divine Chariot and teleported again.</p><p>The two demon kings missed their target.</p><p>The Golden Horned Bull Demon's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>The occupant of the chariot clearly hadn't reached the Five Talisman Realm; he was merely a Cave Xuan cultivator.</p><p>The Golden Horned Bull Demon had been close to peak Cave Xuan before changing its path. It was quickly recognized by a Great Sage, trained in the Sage's mansion, and even fellow demon kings addressed it as a Daoist friend.</p><p>Confident that few cultivators or demons of similar rank could withstand the Heart Drum, it was stunned by its failure against a clearly inferior opponent.</p><p>The poison field and the Heart Drum, a seemingly flawless ambush, had been easily countered.</p><p>Watching the three escaping figures, the Golden Horned Bull Demon considered pursuing further but lacked the necessary escape techniques, falling far behind in an instant.  Sighing, it soared back towards Thunder City on a cloud of light.</p><p>…</p><p>“Well? That kid and that Divine Chariot aren't simple. Otherwise, I would've captured him by now!”</p><p>The Black Roc transmitted its thoughts.  It felt slightly better; the Scaly Serpent’s carefully planned ambush had failed, saving some face for the Roc.</p><p>The Scaly Serpent's eyes flickered. It coldly countered, “Are you sure the chariot can go anywhere?”</p><p>They had only read about such a treasure in the Daoist scriptures – a possession of the Daoist Court.  They had not anticipated its power.</p><p>The Black Roc hesitated. “Isn’t the Divine Court essentially where the Daoist Court worships the Talisman Gods?  The Talisman Gods and the temples are at the heart of the Divine Court.  If the Divine Chariot can freely traverse the temples, where can't it go?”</p><p>Seeing the Divine Chariot's ability to move through the temples, the Black Roc decided they must seize it.</p><p>“What trouble did you run into in Thunder City?”</p><p>“Nine Heavens blocked the way. Perhaps the chariot can ascend to the Nine Heavens.”</p><p>The Scaly Serpent explained briefly, deep in thought.  Unfortunately, among the demon gods who had entered the Divine Court, none possessed void-related bloodline abilities.</p><p>However, even if such an ability existed, the Divine Chariot, drawing power from the Divine Court, could likely still not be controlled.</p><p>“Look at the dragon's condition. We'll keep pursuing, and see how much longer he can last,”  the Black Roc added, “Just don't let him get into the Three Enclosures!”</p><p>The Scaly Serpent understood and examined the Divine Chariot. It was as the Roc said, but a lingering worry clouded its eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang was in mortal danger, and their own anxiety was evident.  They wondered about the situation outside the Divine Court. Their biggest concern was the Great Sage, who hadn't entered the Divine Court even after all this time.  Were they under attack by True Lords outside the South Heavenly Gate?</p><p>Their only hope was that Thunder City would provide a breakthrough, as suggested by the Roc.</p><p>The two demons continued their pursuit, their communication hidden.  Their combined abilities and coordination were formidable.</p><p>With the Scaly Serpent's participation, the pressure on Qin Sang intensified many times over. His room to maneuver shrank, forcing him to teleport repeatedly to escape.  Watching the Divine Chariot's condition deteriorate, he grew increasingly desperate.</p><p>The two demons couldn't prevent the chariot’s teleportation, but they could try to block its path.</p><p>Qin Sang saw through their intentions, but was helpless, forced to flee towards the non-core star region.  Even with numerous divine talismans, without sufficient cultivation, the temple's barrier couldn't withstand the two demon kings' combined attack for long.</p><p>Three streaks of light chased each other within the Divine Court.  Golden light flashed like lightning.  Wherever it passed, golden palaces collapsed, divine talismans fell, leaving behind ruins.</p><p>...</p><p>While Qin Sang was being hunted by the demon kings, the war on the ground raged.  In the north of Zhongmao, Jing Zhen was under siege.  Elder Ruquan stood on the city wall, her clothes fluttering, gazing at the overwhelming dark clouds of demonic beasts outside the city, her face full of worry.  A monstrous horde was at the gates!</p><p>She looked east, but the distance was too great to see the sword light. However, Daoist cultivators in the northern fairy cities could feel the earth-shattering sword intent emanating from it.  Opposing the sword intent was another terrifying aura.</p><p>Beyond the distant mountains, the sword light hung in the sky.  A giant scaled carp beast, driven mad by pain and the beating of war drums, roared furiously at the sword light.  Its wounds were still unhealed, blood flowing down the gaps in its scales.  The constant pain instilled an uncontrollable fear, preventing it from crossing a certain threshold.</p><p>This wasn't the only True Monarch-level beast; behind the horde, other beasts with comparable auras were held back by the sword light, hesitant to advance.</p><p>Elder Ruquan's worry deepened.  Everyone knew that one sword light couldn't stop all the True Monarch-level beasts.  As they were increasingly influenced by the demonic drums, their savagery would eventually overcome their instincts, forcing them to charge. Could the sword light truly fight them all?</p><p>Even more terrifyingly, in the depths of the Vile Origin and Vile Sea, even more powerful beings existed, comparable to True Monarch-level beasts.  Some called them fiends, demons, and evil spirits of the world.  Unlike ordinary ghosts, Daoist scriptures described them as "Six Heavens Old Ghosts," some believing they were born from the Six Heavens Old Qi, others that they were the source of it.</p><p>These Six Heavens Old Ghosts were unaffected by the demonic drums, but the drums' slaughter would ultimately attract them with the bloodshed.  Highly cultivated cultivators already sensed their ferocious and agitated auras.</p><p>The drumming showed no signs of stopping. The Gui Fang demons had gone mad. The beast tide wouldn't differentiate friend from foe. Gui Fang couldn't organize defenses as tight as the Daoist Court's; perhaps it would be destroyed even sooner.</p><p>"The Daoist Court's survival hangs in the balance. Can the two True Monarchs turn the tide?"  Elder Ruquan, seeing the terrifying scene outside the city, couldn't help but hesitate.</p><p>"Daoist Ruquan, we must personally set up formations to defend against the great evils. The Heavenly Doctor and Plague Departments are in your charge."  A raspy voice echoed in her ears.</p><p>Elder Ruquan recognized the voice, turned, and bowed her hands in response.  A streak of light flew from the city and was grasped in her hand—a command arrow.</p><p>Colorful escaping lights flashed within the city; teams of Daoists arrived as ordered, gathering under Elder Ruquan's command.</p><p>During the Daoist Court's heyday, its methods primarily relied on talismans, yet encompassed everything.  The Divine Court's divine talismans included not only the Thunder and Star Departments, but also Plague, Fire, Heavenly Doctor, and others.</p><p>The Heavenly Doctor Department, as its name suggests, consisted of sects skilled in alchemy and medicine.  Jingquan Temple was one of them.</p><p>The Plague Department dealt with plagues and poisons, also related to alchemy and medicine. Therefore, Daoists practicing these two arts were led by Elder Ruquan.  The Grand True Monarchs had more important tasks; Elder Ruquan, having voluntarily reduced her cultivation, possessed unparalleled experience and strength, making her the natural choice.</p><p>'Swish!'  Elder Ruquan summoned an altar, pointed her jade bamboo staff, and gave orders from the altar.  Many True Ones summoned their own altars, arranging themselves around Elder Ruquan, their auras connecting, their spiritual light illuminating the heavens!</p><p>Elder Ruquan stepped on the Celestial Gan, danced with her treasure staff—the Heavenly Doctor Staff—once essential to Heavenly Doctor Department cultivators, aiding in spells and incantations.  The staff emitted divine light, transforming into spiritual talismans in midair.</p><p>Elder Ruquan looked up at the heavens and chanted softly.</p><p>"Today, Jingquan Temple disciple, Daoist name Ruquan, burns talismans to petition, reporting a decree talisman.  I report to the Heavenly Doctor Messenger, the Shangyao Lingguan, the Disease-Curing Jade Maiden, the Law-Roasting Golden Boy... I command and entrust you to my altar.  The decree arrives, act swiftly; delay not! I petition!"</p><p>The other True Ones chanted along, their incantations grand and solemn, though the deities invoked varied among them.</p><p>Spell power merged with the talismans.  Elder Ruquan picked up a spiritual talisman, flicked her jade hand, and the talisman ignited, its fragrance rising like a ray of light to the heavens.</p><p>Elder Ruquan's eyes shone with expectation.  Other Daoist cultivators also looked to the heavens, their faces tense, holding their breaths.</p><p>Suddenly, muffled cries of astonishment rang out.  Spiritual light suddenly shone from some altars, emanating from the Daoists on them.  Sensing the divine beings, divine power descended, blessing the Daoist cultivators.  They felt an abundance of divine power pouring into their bodies.</p><p>This feeling, aside from those in Yintian Palace, was something Daoist cultivators had never experienced, only read about in scriptures.  It was real. Long awaited!</p><p>At that moment, tears filled the eyes of all the Daoist cultivators who witnessed it.</p><p>(End)</p>
