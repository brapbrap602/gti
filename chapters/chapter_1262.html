<h1>Chapter 1254: Fishing</h1><p>Chapter 1254: Fishing</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang was about to act when a strange, bloody light suddenly erupted from the ground in the center of the stone chamber, followed by a peculiar blood-red vortex.  The bloody light and vortex vanished in a flash.</p><p>"This is a prison cell!"</p><p>Qin Sang knew it was likely the mother of Fat Chicken sensing their arrival and attacking the cell's barrier.  Indeed, the bloody light flickered repeatedly, but the person inside couldn't break free.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly deployed his magic banner to set up a large formation, then unleashed magic fire to probe and attack. Fat Chicken, desperate to save its mother, also wanted to help, but Qin Sang stopped him.</p><p>The Thunder Falcon Yao Wang had been trapped here for so long, showing the power of the prison's barrier. He needed to use his celestial eye ability to slowly crack the barrier and find its weak points.  If all else failed, he'd have to ask his senior sisters for help.</p><p>Judging by the intensity, Fat Chicken's mother seemed lively and not weak, much better than expected. She hadn't suffered much torment.</p><p>Under attack from both inside and outside, the vortex spun faster and faster.</p><p>Jing Yu, inside the prison cell, saw this and desperately tried to break through.</p><p>Fat Chicken, unable to help, became increasingly restless seeing the barrier's strength.</p><p>"Focus your senses on the Thunder Bead, try to contact your mother. She's been trapped here for years; she must understand the prison's barrier," Qin Sang barked at Fat Chicken.</p><p>He couldn't multitask for long and needed to communicate directly with Fat Chicken's mother to break the barrier together!</p><p>Fat Chicken immediately complied, unhesitatingly spitting out a mouthful of essence blood.</p><p>The Thunder Bead absorbed the blood, its light growing even brighter.</p><p>Now, only the barrier separated mother and son.</p><p>Sensing the Thunder Bead's sudden surge in energy, Jing Yu understood the plan. She quickly flapped her wings, gathering thunder in front of her to form a huge ball of lightning.  She merged her spirit into the ball, focusing on sensing the Thunder Bead.</p><p>"Child!"</p><p>A voice, faint as a mosquito's buzz, suddenly came from the Thunder Bead.</p><p>This gentle call, transcending two hundred years, struck straight to their hearts.</p><p>The familiar voice stunned Fat Chicken.</p><p>"Mother!"</p><p>Fat Chicken cried out, tears in its eyes. Fortunately, its cultivation was high enough that it managed to suppress its overwhelming emotion, quickly getting down to business. "Mother, I, and Old… Qin Senior, are here to save you! How much do you know about the prison barrier?"</p><p>'Don't call him "Old Master," call him Qin Senior,' Qin Sang had instructed.</p><p>Fat Chicken had sworn to serve Qin Sang upon rescuing its mother, but Qin Sang hadn't taken it seriously.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't interested in Fat Chicken, but its mother's powerful abilities.  Seeing her child pledging allegiance, even to a lifesaver, wouldn't leave a good impression; Qin Sang didn't want to anger a mother.</p><p>Jing Yu also understood the gravity of the situation.</p><p>Over the years, she had tried countless times, thoroughly understanding the prison barrier, but her power was insufficient to escape. Now that someone had come to rescue her, with attacks from both inside and outside, hope was high.</p><p>After hearing Jing Yu's description, they immediately formulated a strategy to break the barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his sword formation, deploying the remaining magic banners and summoning magic fire.  He kept some to fend off the black-armored men, using the rest to furiously attack the prison barrier.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The magic fire continuously bombarded the blood-red vortex, causing the stone chamber to violently shake.</p><p>Inside the prison, Jing Yu, bathed in lightning, exerted all her strength to surge upwards.</p><p>Their attacks were always focused on the same point. The vortex spun faster and faster, reaching its limit, the bloody light starting to disperse.</p><p>They relentlessly attacked, aided by the Celestial Eye Butterfly, consistently finding the weakest point of the barrier.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Finally, the vortex couldn't hold any longer and collapsed.  A bolt of lightning broke through the air, finally escaping the cage!</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, withdrawing his magic banners and wielding his ebony sword to eliminate the remaining black-armored men. Turning, he saw the mother and son embracing tightly.</p><p>A faint smile appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Reaching the late Yao Dan stage, and still having a living mother who could be called "Mother" freely—it was rare indeed.</p><p>"Little Fattie, let Mother have a good look at you."</p><p>Jing Yu had returned to human form, cradling Fat Chicken's head, examining it closely.</p><p>Fat Chicken's eyes darted around, its face embarrassed.</p><p>The name 'Little Fattie' was related to Qin Sang.</p><p>Years ago, when it had just hatched, Qin Sang had given it a sound beating. When Jing Yu returned after driving away the two leaders of the Wuji Sect, it cried to its mother, complaining of its grievances.</p><p>Jing Yu was initially fearful and furious.</p><p>But hearing its complaints about Qin Sang calling it "Fat Chicken," she found it remarkably apt and simply called it Little Fattie from then on.</p><p>She had intended to give it a proper name when it matured, but fate intervened, separating them for two hundred years.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist Qin, for saving us.  My son and I wouldn't have been reunited for a very long time otherwise.  Should you ever need my help, Jingyu will do everything in my power."</p><p>Jingyu quickly composed herself after the joyful reunion, approached Qin Sang, and bowed deeply.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, "I share a bond with your son. He has also helped me several times.  There's no need for such formality, Immortal Jingyu.  The Blood Lake is dangerous, so I had to use this treasure to protect him.  This is a temporary measure. I'll remove the restriction once we return. Please don't worry."</p><p>Qin Sang pointed to the Hun Yuan Tong Xin ring on the fat chicken.</p><p>He knew Jingyu would see through the restriction on the chicken, so he explained it beforehand to avoid misunderstanding.</p><p>Jingyu glanced at the chicken, her worry subsiding.  She quickly said, "No, no! It must be thanks to your meticulous guidance, Daoist Qin, that Little Fat has achieved such cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled at the nickname "Little Fat," nodding.  "I do treat him like a younger generation.  However, I haven't actually taught him much. His achievements are due to his own hard work and filial piety in rescuing his mother."</p><p>After a pause, Qin Sang's expression turned serious. "I understand you want to share your reunion with your son, but the situation outside is urgent. We need your help; let's leave the Black Tower first."</p><p>Jingyu, reluctant to let the chicken go, held it tightly as she followed Qin Sang, fighting their way out of the Black Tower.</p><p>Although she had been trapped for many years, she hadn't been severely mistreated and hadn't lost much of her strength. Qin Sang had prepared healing pills for her, but they seemed unnecessary.</p><p>Once out of the Black Tower, they reached a safe place and began to discuss matters at hand.</p><p>Qin Sang briefly explained their purpose and journey to Jingyu, and asked why she had entered the Blood Lake initially and what she had encountered there.</p><p>Recalling the painful past, Jingyu gritted her teeth, her expression furious. She said coldly, "I was lured in by a magical elixir!"</p><p>"Lured?" Qin Sang was taken aback.</p><p>Jingyu nodded. "Daoist Qin, consider this. The Wu Jian Blood Mulberry is not a sentient spirit tree, so why did it suddenly appear, and why did its phantom project itself into the Blood Lake? My experience was the same as those predecessors who were drawn in by the Wu Jian Blood Mulberry. However, they used more sophisticated methods; they fished the Wu Jian Blood Mulberry out from the outside. I, however, was unaware and fell into the trap before I could react."</p>
