Chapter 619: The Book of Witch Insects (Bonus chapter for League Leader Big Red Date's mother!)


The Book of Curious Insects was merely a compilation created by the Spirit Taming Sect, based on the experiences of their predecessors and ancient texts unearthed from ancient battlefields. The Spirit Taming Sect was renowned for its beast-taming arts, and Qin Sang even suspected that they were supported by the Heavenly Demon Mound. Disciples specializing in insect control were only a part of the sect.

"Fellow Daoist, don't you think they resemble Blood-Winged Ghost Head Hornets?"

Qin Sang walked over to the corpse of a Blood-Winged Ghost Head Hornet. The creature's blood-red wings had been completely burned away, leaving only its round body.

Yuan Hu examined it for a moment, then mused, "Now that you mention it, they do resemble the Ghost Head Hornets ranked 520th in the Book of Witch Insects. I wonder why they've mutated and grown blood wings. Ghost Head Hornets have been extinct in the Western Frontier for a long time. Why have they suddenly reappeared, and in a mutated form?"

Turning to the Sky Moon Tribe's shaman, Yuan Hu asked, "Great Shaman, did you notice anything unusual before these strange hornets appeared?"

The shaman shook his head. "Our hunters discovered the disappearance of prey during their hunts and followed the tracks here, where they found the hornets' nest. We tried several times to deal with them, but we couldn't, so we sent a message to the Five Insect Sect for help. The surrounding area is our Sky Moon Tribe's hunting grounds, and there were no anomalies before. These hornets seem to have appeared out of nowhere."

It seemed that the Book of Witch Insects also listed Ghost Head Hornets, but it differed greatly from the Spirit Taming Sect's Book of Curious Insects. The Book of Witch Insects appeared to have a clear ranking system for spirit insects. The Spirit Taming Sect's list simply enumerated the insects, providing descriptions of their characteristics; some entries merely recounted legends from ancient texts, without any definitive ranking.

In the Book of Curious Insects, the Spirit Taming Sect held the Ghost Head Hornet in high regard. According to an ancient text, there had been instances of Ghost Head Hornets undergoing multiple transformations, reaching a power comparable to Nascent Soul cultivators, with the potential for further transformation. It was for this reason that the Ghost Head Hornet was included in the Book of Curious Insects. However, in the Book of Witch Insects, the Ghost Head Hornet seemed less valued, relegated to a position beyond the five hundredth rank.

What criteria did the Book of Witch Insects use? Qin Sang wondered.

"There are many larvae in the nest. I wouldn't mind giving you a couple. However, I don't have a tool for storing spirit insects. If you have any spares, could you sell me one?"

"I happen to have a white bamboo insect basket. I'll trade it for two larvae."

Yuan Hu's face lit up with delight as he produced a finely woven, narrow-necked bamboo basket, a tool specifically designed for storing witch insects.

Out of goodwill, Yuan Hu cautioned Qin Sang, "You don't even have an insect basket; it seems you don't specialize in insect control. If you plan to use these strange hornets as your lifebound insect gu, you should consider it carefully. Spirit insect transformation is difficult, and mutations may affect the transformation process, in severe cases even eliminating the ability to transform. Each person can only have one lifebound insect gu, and cultivating it requires immense effort. If you realize something's wrong later and want to change, you'll have to start over, which could delay important matters!"

The more Qin Sang listened, the more he felt the lifebound insect gu resembled a lifebound magical treasure. Apart from special cultivation methods like the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter," each cultivator could only have one lifebound magical treasure. Could it be that a lifebound insect gu also occupied the same slot as a lifebound magical treasure? Two for one sounded appealing, but if the lifebound insect gu couldn't transform and keep pace with the cultivator's own power, it would become useless.

Qin Sang nodded, thanking Yuan Hu for his advice. He had been raising the Blood-Winged Ghost Head Hornets for many years and had already suspected that the price they paid for adapting to the Cliffless Valley, mutating into Blood-Winged Ghost Head Hornets, might be the loss of their transformation potential.

Placing the hornet nest into the white bamboo insect basket, Qin Sang bid farewell to the three and continued westward. On the map, Bear Mountain and the Five Insect Sect were located in the northwest. The entire Bear Mountain region was extremely barren, with few peaks possessing spiritual veins. The slightly more substantial spiritual veins were almost all occupied, claimed by large tribes with powerful shamans.

These large tribes were like small nations within the Small Cold Region. Each tribe controlled a vast territory, though their populations were far smaller than those of the Small Cold Region, consisting of ordinary villages similar to Thousand Households Village. Thousand Households Village was affiliated with a larger tribe called Winged Serpent Tribe.  These large tribes were interconnected, and disturbing one could affect them all. Qin Sang, with his injuries not yet fully healed, didn't want to attract too much attention or clash with local powers.

West of the Bear Mountain region, deeper into the heart of the Western Frontier, the terrain became even more treacherous and inhospitable. Some unclaimed spiritual veins were occupied by monstrous beasts. With the Flying Night Devil's strength, seizing a cave dwelling wouldn't be difficult.

...

*Bang!*

A dark figure plummeted from the sky, crashing heavily onto the rocks, scattering broken feathers. It was a black eagle, its wingspan reaching a full ten feet. It was a majestic creature, a mid-stage Demon Spirit realm great demon, the king of the nearby beasts.  Black eagles were skilled in escape techniques, possessing astonishing speed. If it focused on fleeing, even an ordinary Core Formation cultivator would likely struggle to catch it. Encountering Qin Sang and the Flying Night Devil was its misfortune.

Dazed from the fall, the black eagle staggered to its feet. Suddenly, a shadowy figure approached like a wraith.  Unaware, the black eagle's neck was seized by a ghostly hand. A *crack* echoed, and it died instantly.

Standing on the mountaintop, Qin Sang watched from afar as the Flying Night Devil easily slew the demon. He instructed it to bring the eagle's carcass up and stand guard outside the cave, then entered the cave himself. The spiritual vein within this mountain was decent, sufficient for Core Formation. Everything was ready. This time, Qin Sang intended to remain in seclusion until he successfully formed his core.

The black eagle died without a sound, unknown to anyone.  The cave dwelling had a new master.  The Flying Night Devil stood guard outside like a gate god.

Inside the cave, Qin Sang sat cross-legged. Through consuming spirit pills and cultivating, his divine sense had mostly recovered. However, Qin Sang couldn't wait any longer.  He roused himself from meditation, flipped his palm, and a jade box appeared.

Inside the jade box lay a purple spirit fruit, surrounded by cloud patterns and emitting a rich fragranceâ€”the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit!

Opening the jade box, Qin Sang traced the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit with his finger, his expression shifting, tinged with a touch of sentiment. The price he had paid for Foundation Establishment all those years ago, and all the twists and turns he had endured, could finally be compensated for. Wanderer Yun had played a crucial role in obtaining this fruit. He wondered if Wanderer Yun had survived his tribulation and how he was doing now.

Putting aside his thoughts, Qin Sang lifted his head and swallowed the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit whole. Then, with his divine sense, he guided the Ebony Sword to absorb the surrounding spiritual energy, enveloping the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit and beginning the refinement process. The fruit's skin was remarkably tough. Coupled with Qin Sang's restricted spiritual power, he could only rely on killing talismans, further slowing down the refinement.

After a full half-day, Qin Sang finally refined the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.  The fruit transformed into an extremely pure medicinal power, merging into his body.

Qin Sang had consumed pills like the Profound Pattern Harmonizing Pill, and his injuries had already healed by ninety percent.  Only a sliver remained, yet it felt like an insurmountable chasm.  He had tried everything, but to no avail. Now, nourished by the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit's medicinal power, his foundation was finally fully restored!
