Chapter 352: Han Xian Shi


You Mountain Market Town.
Deep mountains and valleys, dense forests and mist.
Just as I remember it.
It seems that in these years, You Mountain Market Town hasn't undergone any major changes.


Qin Sang descended from the clouds, wearing a hooded cloak. Standing before the market entrance, he recalled his past quest for immortality, a feeling of impermanence washing over him before he let out a carefree laugh.


At this moment, the mist swirled, and a young man, only at the third level of Qi Condensation, emerged. Seeing Qin Sang, his expression showed a slight surprise, and he quickly bowed in greeting: "Junior Zhang Feng greets senior!"


"Are you the gatekeeper of You Mountain Market Town?"


Qin Sang sized him up and asked.


It wasn't the previous gatekeeper.  It's understandable; that person was just an ordinary mortal, quite elderly at the time. Many years have passed, he must have long since passed away.


Zhang Feng nodded repeatedly, "Senior's eyesight is excellent!  By order of the master, I am here to welcome fellow cultivators and guests entering the market town. Our You Mountain Market Town is the largest market in the entire You Mountain range.  If senior wishes to purchase spirit pills, magical artifacts, or other items, I can assist you.  If you have other matters, I can also report to my elders and help you out."


Qin Sang nodded, saying, "I'm just here to take a look, and to retrieve something…"


The You Mountain range lies on the edge of the righteous path forces, bordering the demonic path, situated slightly east of south of Yin Mountain Pass. The area is a melting pot of various people, so when Qin Sang last visited the market town, he saw all kinds of individuals.


The fact that You Mountain Market Town has stood for so many years in such an environment shows that its owner is no ordinary person.


Essentially, the righteous and demonic paths in the Lesser Cold Domain are divided by the line south of Yin Mountain Pass. The Yuanzhao Gate and Kuiyin Sect are located on either side of this line, facing each other.


Fearing that he might run into acquaintances, Qin Sang took a detour, avoiding the former site of Yuanzhao Gate, before arriving at You Mountain Market Town. His purpose was to retrieve a letter left by Tan Hao and erase any trace of it.


In his moment of peril, Tan Hao didn't forget to leave a warning letter, which is one of the reasons Qin Sang was willing to help him.


He presented Tan Hao's token to Zhang Feng.


Zhang Feng didn't possess the same exceptional memory as the previous gatekeeper. He said, "Please wait a moment, senior…"


Then he hurried inside.


Shortly afterwards, Zhang Feng brought out a yellowed letter, quickly approaching, "Reporting to senior, there is indeed a letter that has not been collected.  Is this it? This letter was left by a fellow cultivator over forty years ago. The writer left no information and has not reappeared since."


Qin Sang took the letter and unfolded it. The contents were simple, the coded message left by the Tan brothers, warning him not to continue cultivating with the Yan Luo Banner.


With a wave of his hand, he crushed the letter into dust. Qin Sang nodded to Zhang Feng, "Thank you, fellow cultivator, it's this letter."


He had planned to leave immediately, but Qin Sang suddenly felt a whim to go inside and take a look. Although he hadn't spent much time in You Mountain Market Town, it held great significance for him; it could be considered the starting point of his journey into the cultivation world.


From here, he entered the Kuiyin Sect, experiencing Yuanzhao Gate, Shao Hua Mountain, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and now.


Zhang Feng sensed Qin Sang's desire for privacy and tactfully retreated.


With these thoughts, Qin Sang entered the market town.


Streets and canals crisscrossed, shops lined the streets, willow trees shaded the walkways, and people bustled along, mostly ordinary mortals.


Some places were still recognizable from memory, but much had changed.


These ordinary people were used to seeing people in cloaks and masks; nobody rushed over to gawk. Qin Sang walked silently through the streets, unconsciously arriving at the cobblestone street inside You Mountain Market Town.


In the square surrounded by flowing water, some cultivators were still setting up stalls, but the flow of people was far less dense than before.


The square was mostly populated by Qi Condensation cultivators.  To reminisce about the past, Qin Sang strolled through the square, finding nothing of interest and failing to see the fat man who had sold him the *You Ming Scripture*.


Right, the Artifact Pavilion!


Qin Sang quickened his pace, arriving at the wooden building he remembered.


The wooden building remained, but the signboard had been replaced with 'Autumn Water Tower', selling various common cultivation materials.  It was nearly deserted; the shopkeeper was lazily dozing on a recliner.


The shopkeeper next to the Artifact Pavilion, with whom he had once spoken, was gone.


Qin Sang glanced at it and turned to leave.


At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly sensed two powerful auras.  He looked up towards the entrance of the cobblestone street and saw five people approaching from afar.


Surprisingly, all five were cultivators, two of whom were Foundation Establishment cultivators!


While they didn't act arrogantly, the presence of two Foundation Establishment cultivators together drew attention; pedestrians made way for them.


Qin Sang frowned inwardly. He didn't want to needlessly provoke enemies. Just as he was about to step aside, he suddenly stopped, his gaze fixed on the person leading the group, a look of surprise gradually appearing on his face.


This man was tall and powerfully built, exuding an extraordinary aura. His cultivation base was unexpectedly at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.

It's difficult to judge a Foundation Establishment cultivator's true age from appearances alone.

He had sharp eyebrows and bright eyes, a strong jawline, and looked barely thirty.  However, his cultivation level and unusually calm demeanor belied his youthful appearance.

He seemed to be the leader of the five.

The other three, including the subtly powerful elder, acted as his guards. Their eyes constantly scanned their surroundings, their auras sharp as drawn swords, ready for any sudden attack. They were highly vigilant.

At his waist, he wore a round jade pendant.  The warm jade was engraved with the characters "Pure Yang."

In the cultivation world, only disciples of one sect are entitled to wear such a pendant: the Pure Yang Sect, one of the Eight Great Righteous Sects!

However, there was a slight difference from the typical Pure Yang Sect disciple's pendant. Below the characters "Pure Yang," there was a small additional character—Han.

Qin Sang recognized the pendant.

He also recognized the man.

This was the Han Xian Shi (Master Han) whom he'd saved at Gu Ling Mountain years ago, the one who'd given him a token and guided him to You Shan Market!

Although years had passed, Master Han hadn't changed much, and Qin Sang recognized him instantly.

Why was he here?  Qin Sang wondered.

After obtaining the Xiaohan Domain map, Qin Sang suspected Master Han might be a member of the Han family, and now it seemed confirmed.

The Han family was a cultivator family affiliated with the Pure Yang Sect, but they resided south of You Shan Market—a considerable distance away, and this area was not under the Pure Yang Sect's influence.

He harbored no resentment towards Master Han.

While the token Master Han had given him had led him down a somewhat misleading path, Master Han had clearly stated that it was Qin Sang's own choice.

However, there was one question Qin Sang had never understood.

He hadn't had time to deal with such minor matters before, and since it was already done, further contemplation would be futile and a waste of precious cultivation time.

But now that they’d met, perhaps he could finally get some answers.
