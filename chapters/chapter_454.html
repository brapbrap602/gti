Chapter 447: Selling Corpses


It must have been midday, but Mist Island was darker than the waters surrounding Chaos Island.  Through the fog, a shadowy island shape was just barely visible.


Mist Island had a larger population than the main island, though it wasn't large itself, with narrow streets and cultivators hurrying past, giving it a crowded feel.


Qin Sang, now clad in a black robe, observed for a moment before leaping onto the island. He blended into the crowd and approached a large shop.


“Sir, please come in…”


Several young women, all at the Qi Condensation stage, stood inside the shop. They seemed unfazed by Qin Sang's attire.


As he entered, a girl warmly greeted him, smiling and leading him into a private room before sealing the entrance.


Bowing slightly, she spoke respectfully, "May I ask if you wish to buy or sell something, sir?  We have talismans, pills, cultivation techniques…"


Qin Sang knew this establishment well. Before the girl could finish, he cut her off with a wave of his hand, his voice rough and terse as he uttered two words:  "Selling corpses!"


With that, he opened the corpse pouch beneath his robe, unleashing nine corpse puppets that flew out and lined up behind him.


The nine corpses stood silently, each wearing an identical silver mask that concealed faces Qin Sang had deliberately mutilated.  Their dark eyes peered out from the mask's eyeholes, emitting an unsettling, creepy glow.


A powerful aura of killing intent emanated from the corpses.


The temperature in the room plummeted instantly, filled with a chilling Yin energy.


These corpses were all opponents Qin Sang had slain recently. Those with intact bodies and undamaged energy centers he'd turned into煞尸 (sha corpses). However, the strongest among them had only been at the Foundation Establishment mid-stage.


Qin Sang kept the corpses of Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivators, as well as the living corpses, for himself.


The war between the two realms, especially in its later stages, meant cultivators always traveled in groups, making solo travel rare. Qin Sang didn't want anyone to discover his ability to create corpses.


He could summon one or two to save his life in a crisis, but he couldn't keep them with him constantly; otherwise, he'd be no different from a member of a demonic sect.


He couldn't explain this to his sect.


War inevitably resulted in corpses.  Having accumulated these, and finding them of little immediate use, Qin Sang decided to sell the weaker ones to acquire cultivation resources.


Mist Island was the perfect place to offload them.


Although Qin Sang's actions were shocking, the girl showed little fear, as if selling corpses was commonplace.


And it was.


In the cultivation world, cultivators practicing demonic or ghost cultivation selling corpses, Yin spirits, ghost lords, etc., was as normal as a puppeteer selling puppets or a beastmaster selling spirit beasts.


Corpses were simply another commodity.


However, in the Lesser Cold Region, sects specializing in puppets were few and far between, and mostly unknown, while demonic cultivation was quite prevalent.


The girl clearly wasn't seeing this for the first time, only her eyes widening in surprise at the sheer number of corpses.


"Please find an overseer to appraise these corpses for me."  Qin Sang said calmly.


The girl's eyes flickered over the nine corpses before her body stiffened, and a look of surprise appeared.  She murmured, "Please wait a moment, sir," before rushing out, nearly tripping in her haste and leaving the door ajar.


Her strange behavior didn't escape Qin Sang's notice.


He frowned, turning to examine the corpses. Their damaged faces, hidden by masks and identical black robes, would be impossible to recognize, even for a Foundation Establishment expert.


There was only one explanation:  earth煞 energy.


This was the main difference between Qin Sang's corpses and others; the Heavenly Corpse Sect used earth煞 energy, while other demonic cultivators mainly used Yin煞 energy.


Qin Sang tapped his finger on the table, lost in thought. Before he could act, a hurried footstep sounded outside.


Qin Sang's expression shifted as he watched the entrance. A round figure appeared, waddling in with a wide smile.


Such a stout cultivator was rare; the doorway was almost too small for him.


"Greetings, fellow cultivator. My surname is Bao, and I'm the chief manager of this establishment."


Manager Bao bowed, his large size making the bow barely noticeable.


"Manager Bao, I recognize you."


This man was not to be underestimated.


Qin Sang returned the bow.  "I merely wished to sell a few corpses, I didn't expect to disturb Manager Bao."

"Friend, you are indeed an old friend!"

Manager Bao smiled, sat down before Qin Sang, and glanced at the corpses behind him. "Your corpses are quite unique, refined using earth煞 energy.  I've never seen anyone else do it, so I remember you well."

Qin Sang coldly snorted. "Manager Bao is investigating me? Or is refining corpses with earth煞 energy an offense?"

"No, no..."

Manager Bao repeatedly waved his hands. "Friend, please don't misunderstand...Ah! Let me be direct. You've sold corpses in my shop before.  This is your private matter, and I've never investigated you. However, recently I encountered a煞 corpse that was very similar to yours, yet subtly different.  I hoped you could shed some light on it."

Hearing this, Qin Sang understood his purpose. He said calmly, "You mean the living corpse I offered at the auction?"

"Living corpse! Yes! Living corpse!"

Manager Bao nodded repeatedly. "That name is perfect. That living corpse's sentience far surpassed these corpses; it was entirely different!"

Qin Sang chuckled. "So? You're interested in the living corpse?"

Six months ago, he attended an auction on Mist Island. A high-quality spiritual herb that could boost cultivation was being auctioned. He was short of funds, but desperately wanted the herb.  He ultimately used a living corpse to persuade the owner to trade for the herb.

This was his only exposure of the living corpse's existence, yet it had fallen into the wrong hands.

Manager Bao didn't hesitate, immediately admitting, slightly bowing, "My apologies, I wish to ask how many living corpses you possess, and what is the strength of the strongest one?"

"Don't you know such questions are private?"

Qin Sang snorted. "However, I can answer you.  These living corpses are extremely difficult to create; I only possessed that single one, and after exchanging it for the herb, I have none left. As for its strength, it's roughly similar to these corpses. If you wish to buy, I have higher quality corpses.  A fair price, and I'll gladly sell you a few."
