<h1>Chapter 359: The Lineage</h1><p>"From now on, you don't need to display your great-grandmaster's memorial tablet anymore..."</p><p>Qin Sang held up Yun Youzi's memorial tablet.</p><p>Li Yufu was puzzled at first, then suddenly realized something, his face filled with shock. "Great-grandmaster, could it be that he..."</p><p>Li Yufu had been holding back from asking, but he clearly remembered his master mentioning more than once that his senior, Qin Sang, was only a couple of years older than him.</p><p>Qin Sang was now over seventy years old, but his appearance was still as youthful as a teenager.</p><p>There could only be one explanation.</p><p>His senior had truly become an immortal.</p><p>But Li Yufu never expected that his great-grandmaster was also an immortal!</p><p>Neither his master nor his grandmaster had ever mentioned this, perhaps they didn't know.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded, making a joke. "I didn't expect Senior Yun Youzi to have stepped onto the path of immortality before me. I met him by chance a few years ago, and luckily, I had seen his portrait before and recognized him. The old man is doing well now.  Aren't you cursing him by displaying his memorial tablet?"</p><p>Li Yufu reverently put away the memorial tablet, still finding it hard to believe that among the six members of the Qingyang lineage, including Qin Sang, two were cultivators.</p><p>"So, Great-grandmaster, like Senior, has also become an immortal..."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and explained, "We dare not claim to be immortals. We are merely cultivators, individuals who have mastered powerful abilities... Senior Yun Youzi's journey was much more arduous than mine. He embarked on this path at seventy-eight, achieving Foundation Establishment at the age of one hundred. Such an accomplishment is rare in the cultivation world, stemming from his unwavering belief. Although Abbot Jixin and Mingyue were mortals, their enshrinement and veneration by the people are inseparable from Senior's teachings. I only hope that your descendants will not forget..."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Li Yufu bowed respectfully. "This disciple will heed Senior's teachings."</p><p>Jingtian quickly followed suit.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the master and disciple before him, nodding inwardly. Li Yufu was not only intelligent but also possessed good character.</p><p>Although he stayed in the Ancestors' Hall, his divine sense had been covering the Qingyang Hall, silently observing Li Yufu and his disciple's behavior.</p><p>Throughout the day, Qin Sang had a sense of déjà vu.</p><p>The people who came to the Qingyang Hall for medical treatment were all local commoners. None of them underestimated Li Yufu because of his young age; everyone treated him with great respect.</p><p>Li Yufu and his disciple treated everyone equally, regardless of their wealth.</p><p>If a patient truly couldn't afford the medical fee and chose to put it on credit, Li Yufu didn't show any impatience. Although his ledger wasn't as thick as Abbot Jixin's, it had accumulated a considerable stack.</p><p>All his actions came from the heart, natural and unforced.</p><p>This couldn't have been achieved without Abbot Jixin and Mingyue's guidance.</p><p>If it were an act, it couldn't have fooled Qin Sang's discerning eye. Even if Li Yufu were cunning, a child like Jingtian couldn't have maintained such a perfect facade.</p><p>Abbot Jixin and Mingyue had worthy successors!</p><p>Qin Sang was very pleased.</p><p>At the same time, he could also sense a mixture of anticipation and anxiety hidden in the depths of Li Yufu and Jingtian's eyes when they looked at him.</p><p>He was very familiar with this look.</p><p>Before he had come into contact with the cultivation world, he would have had the same look when encountering a cultivator.</p><p>"Extend your hand, let me see your aptitude..." Qin Sang said.</p><p>Out of gratitude for Abbot Jixin and Mingyue, if Li Yufu and his disciple possessed any aptitude, he naturally wouldn't mind giving them a helping hand.</p><p>However, Qin Sang knew very well that this possibility was very slim.  None of the descendants of the three great families in the Imperial City possessed spiritual roots, and this was the norm.</p><p>Li Yufu's face lit up with joy, and he quickly extended his arm. Jingtian was still a little bewildered, but he knew it must be something good.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>Qin Sang placed his finger on Li Yufu's wrist and let out a soft exclamation. He looked at Li Yufu in surprise, then placed his finger on Jingtian's wrist, examining him before falling into deep thought.</p><p>The master and disciple didn't dare to make a sound, anxiously looking at Qin Sang.</p><p>It was indeed somewhat unexpected. Qin Sang hadn't anticipated that Li Yufu actually possessed spiritual roots, and they were dual water and wood spiritual roots, a top-tier aptitude!</p><p>Comparable to Senior Sister Shi Hong!</p><p>Unfortunately, Jingtian had no spiritual roots and couldn't cultivate.</p><p>While checking their aptitude, Qin Sang also checked Li Yufu's bone age: twenty-five.</p><p>Starting on the path of cultivation at this age seemed a little late, but with his dual spiritual roots, if he cultivated diligently and didn't go astray, there was still hope for Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Using his own qualifications, Qin Sang was confident he could get Li Yufu into Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>However, firstly, Qin Sang himself was still struggling at the Foundation Establishment stage, constantly on the move, and his ability to help was limited.  He couldn't personally guide Li Yufu, at most ensuring his safety and peaceful cultivation within the sect.</p><p>Secondly, tracing back their lineage, there was a clear master-disciple relationship between Li Yufu and Yun Youzi. Directly bringing Li Yufu into Shaohua Mountain seemed to be overstepping his bounds.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that at Yinshan Pass, when Yun Youzi lamented the brotherhood of Tan Hao and his brother, there seemed to be another meaning in his tone. He wondered if Yun Youzi, remembering Abbot Jixin, had the intention of taking on a disciple again?</p><p>If Yun Youzi really wanted to take on a disciple, Li Yufu would be the perfect candidate!</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang made a decision.</p><p>He asked Li Yufu to send Jingtian out to rest first, then told him the truth.</p><p>Li Yufu was overjoyed when he learned the details, but there was a trace of worry in his eyes. He couldn't help but ask, "Senior, can Jingtian really not cultivate with me?"</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in agreement. "Without spiritual roots, he can't cultivate. This is the cruel reality of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p>For a moment, Li Yufu was a mixture of joy and sorrow, and he was greatly disappointed to hear that Qin Sang wouldn't take him as a disciple.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "I will leave you a cultivation method and a few protective talismans. You can stay at Emerald Mountain and cultivate on your own. After I ask Senior Yun Youzi, if he's willing to personally guide you, he'll come and bring you into the immortal sect. Senior Yun Youzi's sect, Taiyi Danzong, is a powerful righteous sect, its strength unmatched in the cultivation world. If you can join Taiyi Danzong, it would be a great fortune..."</p><p>Before the sixth level of Qi Refining, the requirements for spiritual energy weren't so stringent.</p><p>Emerald Mountain was a place of spiritual abundance, gathering spiritual energy, sheltering from wind and accumulating water, a place of excellent feng shui, fully capable of supporting Li Yufu's cultivation needs.</p><p>"However..."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone changed, and he said seriously, "Before that, I have one requirement. You must fulfill it."</p><p>Li Yufu's expression tightened.  He said solemnly, "Please instruct me, Senior."</p><p>Qin Sang was satisfied with Li Yufu's attitude and nodded. "Stepping onto the path of immortality requires severing ties with the mortal world. Before cultivating, you must pass on the Qingyang lineage. This is your inescapable responsibility. Jingtian has a good nature. Remember to teach him well and don't break the lineage in the mortal world."</p><p>The Qingyang lineage began with Yun Youzi, but it was Abbot Jixin who carried forward the sect's teachings. Over the years, it had accumulated the lifelong efforts of Abbot Jixin and Mingyue.</p><p>It would be a great pity if the lineage were to be broken!</p>
