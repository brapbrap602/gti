<h1>Chapter 489: The Hideout</h1><p>Screams of agony echoed in the distance.</p><p>The demon beasts near the Stone Sea were startled, causing chaos. Some hid in their nests, trembling, while others fled with their families.</p><p>“Hold it down!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't use any magical tools, only the Ten Yama Banners, working in tandem with the Night Fiend to disorient the Black Jiao.</p><p>Following Qin Sang's command, the Night Fiend vanished, reappearing next to the Black Jiao’s head.  Its massive hand slammed down, pinning the Jiao's head against a rock.</p><p>The Black Jiao, pinned and silenced, thrashed its tail, attempting to dislodge the Night Fiend, but the Fiend effortlessly dodged the attacks.</p><p>By now, the Black Jiao's aura was extremely weak.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed forward, pressing the Nine Dragon Chariot Talisman onto the Black Jiao's forehead, channeling his spiritual power to activate the talisman.</p><p>Adhering to the Jiao's forehead, the talisman glowed brightly, like a piece of flawless jade.</p><p>But to the Black Jiao, this jade was a death knell.  The talisman's light, like countless silver needles, caused excruciating pain.</p><p>The Black Jiao convulsed violently, but its resistance was futile.</p><p>Qin Sang focused intently on controlling the talisman.</p><p>Soon, the Black Jiao's struggles ceased. A mysterious, faint light emanated from its forehead, and a palm-sized Jiao dragon spirit was slowly extracted.</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy as he removed the Nine Dragon Chariot Talisman.</p><p>A chain wrapped tightly around the Jiao dragon spirit, binding it firmly.</p><p>It roared in defiance, but couldn't break free. The chain pulled it relentlessly towards the talisman.</p><p>The Jiao dragon spirit's resistance intensified.  This was the most crucial step. With a serious expression, Qin Sang poured all his energy into the talisman, gradually absorbing the spirit.</p><p>The Nine Dragon Chariot Talisman flickered and trembled as the spirit continued to struggle.</p><p>Finally, the talisman calmed down.</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled, retrieving the talisman to examine it.</p><p>His divine sense probed within, confirming the Jiao dragon spirit's submission. Having absorbed two Jiao dragon spirits, the talisman's power had grown considerably.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction, storing the talisman within his body to nurture it.  His gaze shifted to the Night Fiend.</p><p>After this battle, Qin Sang’s confidence in the Night Fiend had grown even stronger.</p><p>The Night Fiend placed the Black Jiao on top of the rock. Qin Sang personally butchered the carcass. The Jiao's remains were valuable and rare. With Qin Sang's refining skills, the carcass, combined with other materials, could be used to create several excellent high-grade magical artifacts.</p><p>However, his standards had risen, and high-grade artifacts no longer held much appeal. This carcass wasn't sufficient for crafting magical treasures, so he wasn't particularly excited.</p><p>After processing the Jiao, Qin Sang retrieved the Night Fiend and the Malignant Corpse he'd placed further away, storing them in his Corpse Puppet Pouch.  He found a secluded spot to test the Nine Dragon Chariot Talisman's increased power, then immediately left the Boundless Valley, flying north towards the Azure Sun Market.</p><p>…</p><p>Cold Mountain City.</p><p>Perhaps Cold Mountain Village would be a more fitting name.</p><p>Cold Mountain City was small, its population much smaller than larger cities. It was built on a hillside.</p><p>Isolated and peaceful, with towering mountains behind and a large river in front, it was a land of abundance, untouched by war, resembling a secluded paradise.</p><p>Fortunately, the surrounding area was spiritually barren, a place powerful demon cultivators would likely overlook.</p><p>However, the city's lord was a cultivator.  The largest family in the city, the lord’s own, had ruled for generations, content to remain local rulers.</p><p>The family name was Ji.</p><p>Ji Wu was the eldest son of the current Ji family head.</p><p>Concealed in the trees on a hill overlooking Cold Mountain City, Qin Sang observed the settlement. The city walls were low but thick, designed to defend against wild beasts.</p><p>People bustled about below like ants.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze moved from the foot of the hill to the halfway point, pausing briefly at a grand palace before continuing upwards.</p><p>His exceptional eyesight allowed him to spot a narrow path winding through the dense forest north of the city.  Masking his presence, he followed the path with his eyes, moving discreetly.</p><p>The path continued to a valley behind the mountains, where it disappeared. Unhurried, Qin Sang’s gaze swept over the beautiful valley, admiring the scenery.</p><p>The valley was filled with peach trees in perpetual bloom, a tapestry of vibrant colors covering the entire area.</p><p>Deep within the peach blossoms, a faint pink mist lingered, refusing to disperse.</p><p>This mist was, in fact, a poisonous peach blossom miasma.  Fatal to ordinary mortals, it posed a danger even to cultivators, especially if the poison entered their internal organs.</p><p>Through the lingering miasma, several buildings were faintly visible.</p><p>This was Dove Robe Cultivator's hideout!</p><p>Ji Wu, possessing exceptional talent, had been taken as a disciple by Dove Robe Cultivator after the cultivator arrived in Cold Mountain City.  Dove Robe Cultivator then chose to seclude himself there, accepting the Ji family’s support.</p><p>However, the Demonic Flame Sect's base wasn't located here.</p><p>Hunted relentlessly by the Yuan Zhao Sect, Dove Robe Cultivator was extremely cautious.</p><p>He understood the importance of having multiple hideouts. This was just one of them, known only to a select few, possibly not even all four Demonic Flame Envoys.</p><p>It wasn't due to some eccentricity that Dove Robe Cultivator planted peach trees around his dwelling.  The Demonic Yin Sect possessed a unique and concealed spirit array that could subtly harness the natural peach blossom miasma, seamlessly integrating it into the surroundings.</p><p>Those unaware of the array, upon entering, would focus solely on dealing with the miasma, oblivious to the hidden trap.</p><p>Dove Robe Cultivator's other hideouts were similarly protected.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't be certain if Dove Robe Cultivator was currently within the peach blossom miasma.</p><p>But according to Yu Hua, this was Dove Robe Cultivator’s most secret hideout, known only to Ji Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang reasoned that if Dove Robe Cultivator had obtained healing medicine, this would be the ideal place to recuperate.  Therefore, he came directly to Cold Mountain City, bypassing the other locations.</p><p>Unable to see clearly through the miasma, Qin Sang couldn't confirm Dove Robe Cultivator’s presence and had to investigate personally.</p><p>He’d learned the method to disable the spirit array from Yu Hua. After surveying the area and easily deciphering the array’s configuration, he suppressed his aura, sealed his nose and mouth, and slipped into the peach blossom miasma from the east.</p>
