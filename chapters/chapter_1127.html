<h1>Chapter 1119: The Nascent Soul Tribulation</h1><p>For more than ten days, there was peace and quiet.</p><p>Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu used this time to separately explore the nearby waters, eliminating potential dangers.</p><p>In the early morning.</p><p>They returned from afar and landed on the island.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, about to speak, when he suddenly felt an inexplicable pressure, appearing without warning, originating from the small island where Yun Youzi was located.</p><p>This pressure was initially faint, but it made Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu tremble.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, the spiritual energy in the surrounding world fluctuated violently.</p><p>In an instant, the originally calm waters became turbulent, with waves crashing against the shore.  The view was filled with raging winds and waves, a terrifying storm about to descend.</p><p>Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu exchanged a glance, their expressions suddenly serious.</p><p>"It's the Heavenly Tribulation!"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone sank, and he quickly said, "As we discussed before, you guard the north, I'll take the other directions."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu didn't waste any words, immediately flying north on his sword, emitting bursts of thunderous sounds.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's guidance, he had already comprehended the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the vortex in the middle of the storm, summoned his white crane, and sent a message to Bai.</p><p>"Go guard the west, if any demonic beasts appear, kill them directly."</p><p>Qin Sang pointed to the west, and the white crane eagerly flew away.</p><p>Having been trapped in Peach Blossom Valley for so long, finally having a chance to stretch its wings, the white crane's cry was full of excitement.</p><p>Then, Bai and Qin Sang also set off, one to the east, one to the south.</p><p>Four Golden Core cultivators guarded the island.</p><p>At this time, the storm intensified.</p><p>At the center of the storm, the protective array could no longer conceal it, and the spirit island appeared.</p><p>Yun Youzi stood alone on the mountain peak, looking up at the sky.</p><p>It was noon, originally cloudless, but after the storm appeared, dark clouds emerged from nowhere, covering the sky in a few breaths.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>A muffled thunder echoed from the clouds, and lightning flashed.</p><p>Qin Sang stood far away in mid-air, gazing at the spirit island.</p><p>He saw that a strange light suddenly burst forth from the center of the storm.  Amidst the dazzling light, shadows of spiritual flags and magic mirrors appeared, forming a huge screen that enveloped Yun Youzi.</p><p>"Such a powerful spiritual array!"</p><p>Even from here, Qin Sang could sense the formidable power of the array.</p><p>Knowing that such an exquisite array was certainly meticulously prepared by Yun Youzi to assist in his tribulation, seeing all the preparations, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved.</p><p>Yun Youzi was surrounded by the spiritual array, and various illusions created by the materialized magic mirrors and spiritual flags danced around him. Even with his Heavenly Eye divine ability activated, Qin Sang could not clearly see his true form, unable to discern Yun Youzi's condition.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A thunderclap echoed, and the clouds thickened.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Tribulation, including wind, thunder, fire, and the heart demon tribulation, this was only a prelude to forming the Nascent Soul, and the first tribulation was not a thunder tribulation, yet the thunder in the clouds already had such terrifying momentum.</p><p>When the real thunder tribulation arrives, it will be unimaginable.</p><p>The space was dark.</p><p>The waves were monstrous.</p><p>The storm raged.</p><p>But the spiritual array around Yun Youzi remained radiant, without the slightest fluctuation.</p><p>As time passed, the spiritual energy fluctuations became increasingly intense.</p><p>The spiritual energy in the world surged, and visible waves of spiritual energy, as if being sucked in by a whale, continuously flowed towards the spirit island, converging above Yun Youzi's head.</p><p>Compared to the scale of the influence now affecting Yun Youzi, Qin Sang's Golden Core formation was insignificant.</p><p>The pure spiritual energy of heaven and earth merged and compressed in the air, with countless sparkles flashing, forming a dreamy scene like a starry sky.</p><p>The starry sky hung high, and starlight gathered into a Milky Way, flowing in the air.</p><p>After a while, a deafening roar suddenly echoed, and the starry sky abruptly contracted inward.  The endless spiritual energy transformed into a dazzling pillar of light, descending from the heavens!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The spirit island trembled, and the storm and thunder also paused for a moment.</p><p>At the same time, where the starry sky had been, patches of seven-colored clouds suddenly appeared, incredibly vibrant and beautiful, surpassing even the most stunning sunset.</p><p>"He succeeded!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu exclaimed simultaneously, but their hearts were even more tense.</p><p>The clouds appeared, and the spiritual energy did not dissipate, indicating that Yun Youzi had already condensed his Nascent Soul, only one step away from becoming a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>As soon as this thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind,</p><p>After a brief pause, the storm and the thunderclouds began to counterattack frantically, the might of Heaven and Earth fully revealed, causing one's heart to tremble.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang noticed that the spiritual array around Yun Youzi's was flickering uncertainly.</p><p>"The Heavenly Tribulation has begun!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes darkened.</p><p>This was the first time he had witnessed a Heavenly Tribulation firsthand, recalling the information he had read before.</p><p>It is said that in the universe, countless creatures exist, and each faces unique tribulations on their path of cultivation.</p><p>For cultivators, the first two tribulations are the Yin Fire and the Bone-eating Wind, followed by Heavenly Thunder.</p><p>The Yin Fire starts from the Yongquan point, burning upwards through the body.  If the physical body is weak, the internal organs will turn to ash, and the limbs will decay. The Bone-eating Wind attacks the soul, like a sharp blade scraping the bones, piercing the Purple Mansion.</p><p>While these two tribulations affect the surrounding environment, their impact is relatively minor.</p><p>Fortunately, the intensity of these three tribulations varies. The Bone-eating Wind and Yin Fire are less powerful than the Heavenly Thunder. With adequate preparation and caution, most cultivators can survive the first two.  Moreover, both the physical body and spirit will be significantly strengthened afterward.</p><p>However, the Heavenly Thunder and the Demonic Heart Tribulation are truly life-threatening!</p><p>“The Yin Fire has ignited.”</p><p>Qin Sang, intently watching the center of the storm and noticing the fluctuations in the spirit array, thought to himself.</p><p>He wasn't worried about the Yin Fire and Bone-eating Wind. Qin Sang shifted his gaze, carefully observing his surroundings to prevent anyone from interfering with Yunyouzi's tribulation.</p><p>He was concerned about Baihe, and so he swiftly patrolled the area.</p><p>Small lake monsters, startled by the power of the tribulation, fled in terror, none daring to approach.</p><p>Returning to his original position, Qin Sang gazed at the storm's center.  He noticed it was intensifying. Around Yunyouzi, the space was darker than before, the wind seemed to have solidified, like a thick, grey veil.</p><p>“Is this the Bone-eating Wind? The Yin Fire has been overcome.”</p><p>Qin Sang was too far to sense the full force of the Bone-eating Wind.</p><p>He looked up at the sky.  Dark clouds churned, and thunder roared incessantly.</p><p>“After the Bone-eating Wind, comes the Heavenly Thunder.”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, his gaze returning to the storm's center, his brow furrowing.</p><p>“The intensity of this grey Bone-eating Wind… it seems wrong.”</p><p>According to the texts Qin Sang had read, the outward manifestation of the Bone-eating Wind usually signifies the peak of the tribulation's power, after which it would gradually weaken.</p><p>Now, something unexpected was happening!</p><p>The grey Bone-eating Wind intensified, forming a thick barrier.  The surrounding storm became incredibly violent, the waters around the island raged without any sign of abating.</p><p>The relentless wind and rain raised fears that the island might shatter.</p><p>The tribulation showed no sign of ending.</p><p>“What's going on?  Are the records inaccurate, or has something happened to Yunyouzi?”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank as he stared intently at the storm's center.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>A leisurely fishing trip yielded nothing. Another all-nighter to catch up on writing.  It'll be late when I finish, so everyone should get some sleep.</p>
