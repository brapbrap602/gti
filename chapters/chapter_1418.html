<h1></h1><p>It was unknown whether the Pure Ocean Sect was truly so vast, or whether it was an illusion created by the array.</p><p>With the help of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang carefully observed the surrounding environment, gradually making some discoveries, but not enough to change the current situation.</p><p>Another two hours passed.</p><p>They didn't know where they had arrived.</p><p>The strange winds not only showed no sign of stopping, but became even more violent, continuous and unceasing.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>The sound of the wind howled, filling their ears.</p><p>From the outside, they seemed to be in a sea of fire.</p><p>The strange winds, fused with the aura of Scarlet Flames, were like streams of fire, engulfing them, constantly roasting them.</p><p>At the same time, they had to be wary of the occasionally appearing Golden Fluid.</p><p>The four focused their minds, not daring to relax.</p><p>They had a premonition that a new change might be about to appear!</p><p>"Wait..."</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly called for everyone to stop.</p><p>Amidst their surprised gazes, Qin Sang stared intently ahead, hesitated for a moment, and suddenly accelerated, rushing forward while holding up the bronze mirror.</p><p>Valley Master Mu and the other two hurriedly followed.</p><p>Before long.</p><p>The figures of the four suddenly stopped, looking at the scene in front of them, their eyes filled with a mixture of surprise and joy.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The space in front of them was no longer empty, filled with red and golden light.</p><p>The light was extremely dazzling, blocking their path, with no end in sight in any direction, boundless and limitless.</p><p>The red light was undoubtedly emitted by the aura of Scarlet Flames.</p><p>The aura of Scarlet Flames here was extremely dense, transformed into a sea of fire.</p><p>Even before getting close, they felt unbearable heat.</p><p>It should be known that this was after the aura had been vented for some time.</p><p>The source of the golden light was a '卍' (swastika) rune, appearing and disappearing intermittently. These runes floated in the sea of fire, even becoming one with the aura of Scarlet Flames.</p><p>Their speculation was confirmed here.</p><p>Over countless years, the aura of Scarlet Flames had indeed merged with the array.</p><p>The '卍' runes were being impacted by the aura of Scarlet Flames, making it difficult to discern their original appearance.</p><p>After carefully observing for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others realized that the original form of the '卍' runes was likely countless golden statues of Buddhas and Arhats, a Thousand Buddha Wall!</p><p>But at this time, it was already completely unrecognizable.</p><p>Valley Master Mu turned his head to look at Qin Sang.</p><p>Without waiting for him to ask, Qin Sang took the initiative to say, "The Myriad Spirit Fruit is behind the Thousand Buddha Wall."</p><p>"It seems we must pass through the Thousand Buddha Wall," Valley Master Mu nodded thoughtfully, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p>"There!"</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi exclaimed softly, raising his hand to point to a place where the red and golden light intersected.</p><p>It looked very much like a crack.</p><p>"The two of you were right before, both advantages and disadvantages, this is our chance!" The cultivator surnamed Qi said with joy, "If we pass through this Thousand Buddha Wall, will we be able to enter the Pure Ocean Sect?"</p><p>"It's not that easy!"</p><p>Qin Sang poured cold water on him, "Along the way, although we need to be vigilant at all times, we haven't encountered any life-threatening dangers. The Myriad Spirit Fruit is still far away from us, the Thousand Buddha Wall is definitely not the end. In my opinion, we may be on the periphery of the sect-protecting grand array."</p><p>"With things like Golden Fluid existing, it's only the periphery?"</p><p>The expressions of Qi and Wang both looked a little unsightly.</p><p>If it weren't for Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu, relying on the two of them alone, they probably wouldn't be able to go far.</p><p>Valley Master Mu's expression remained unchanged, he said in a deep voice: "Since we're here, let's make the best of it, first find a place where we can cross over."</p><p>The four carefully flew closer to the Thousand Buddha Wall.</p><p>The closer they got to the Thousand Buddha Wall, the more tense their minds became.</p><p>Although the aura of Scarlet Flames had merged into the runes of the Thousand Buddha Wall, this fusion was not as harmonious as water blending with milk, but rather a mutual devouring and collision, reaching a delicate balance.</p><p>If they were to pass through the Thousand Buddha Wall, they would inevitably break the balance, attracting the joint strangulation of the two forces.</p><p>If they waited a little longer, until the aura of Scarlet Flames declined to a certain extent, the danger would be greatly reduced, but the advantage of them entering early would also disappear.</p><p>They were within the array, unable to see the full picture of the grand array.</p><p>No one knew whether later entrants would enter another layer of changes in the array.</p><p>The four groped on the Thousand Buddha Wall, searching.</p><p>Soon, they locked onto three cracks.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly activated his Heavenly Eye divine ability, observing the changes in the power around the cracks. In the end, after careful analysis by the four, they determined one that seemed to be the smallest in scale.</p><p>This crack was in the middle of two Arhat statues.</p><p>The faces of the two Arhats had been devoured by the Scarlet Flames, one of them could barely be seen with twisted features, but there was no Buddha-like appearance at all, instead looking like a vicious ghost born from fire.</p><p>Around the crack, the '卍' runes trembled frequently, extremely unstable.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mu, you and I join forces to attack from here, taking advantage of the moment before the Thousand Buddha Wall and the aura of Scarlet Flames close together, forcefully charge in."</p><p>Qin Sang stared for a long time, pointed to a spot in the crack, and said.</p><p>Valley Master Mu nodded, turned his head to Qi and Wang and said, "You are responsible for resisting the strange winds, do not let the aftermath from other places affect this place."</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Qi and Wang nodded, each offering their own magical treasures, looking around.</p><p>Qin Sang also subconsciously had the Heavenly Eye Butterfly observe the surroundings.</p><p>In fact, the strange winds here did not stop at all, leaving no room for anyone to hide. Even if there was a fifth person, it would be impossible to hide around them without being discovered.</p><p>He was just habitually vigilant.</p><p>Confirming that there was nothing unusual around, Qin Sang and the others acted according to the plan, approaching the Thousand Buddha Wall.</p><p>But no one noticed.</p><p>In the distance, two illusory figures were approaching them.</p><p>It was none other than Old Devil Hunmo and Precept Master.</p><p>They were surrounded by an invisible shield, coming from the 'Nine Precepts' finger ring. The shield looked thin, but it could mobilize some of the spirit array's power to protect them. The strange winds would not attack the shield, treating them as if they were nothing.</p><p>In this way, they silently traveled through the strange winds, without any fluctuations.</p><p>However, the hand of Precept Master holding the Nine Precepts finger ring, at this moment, had bulging veins.</p><p>His expression also looked very strained.</p><p>The array had been changed, and the previous tokens were difficult to exert their effects, this kind of shield could not be maintained all the time, and it was only effective on the periphery.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other three could not see them.</p><p>They could clearly see the anomalies in the strange winds ahead, locking onto the location of Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu were completely unaware of this.</p><p>They came to the front of the Thousand Buddha Wall, sparing no effort to activate their true essence, resisting the power from the outside.</p><p>Coming closer, they realized that the crack was much wider than they imagined, the aura of Scarlet Flames and the '卍' runes intertwined together, constantly changing.</p><p>Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu exchanged a glance, and simultaneously offered their respective magical treasures.</p><p>The Goldsink Sword was enough.</p><p>'Swoosh! Swoosh!'</p><p>The Snake Spear and Goldsink Sword advanced side by side, stabbing in fiercely.</p><p>The timing and position they chose were extremely subtle, not directly causing a violent reaction from the two forces.</p><p>Due to the different division of labor, Qin Sang's position was slightly forward.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>A narrow cavity appeared in the crack, and immediately the surrounding red and golden light squeezed inward, this period was the best opportunity!</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed in his heart, his figure moved slightly, just about to call for them to follow him in, a warning suddenly rose in his heart, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly signaled!</p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed greatly, he shouted out loud.</p>
