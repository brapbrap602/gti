<h1>Chapter 1050: The Dragon-Summoning Art</h1><p>Chapter 1050: The Dragon-Summoning Art</p><p>Entering the inner hall, they were surrounded by enemies.</p><p>Humans wouldn't mind leaving all the demon kings behind.</p><p>At that moment, Jiu Feng Wang, who had been silent, intently sensing the Sky Phoenix Restriction, suddenly stirred, exclaiming joyfully, “I've found the exit!”</p><p>With a flash, Jiu Feng Wang flew off in another direction.</p><p>The other demon kings, overjoyed, immediately followed.</p><p>Shortly after, Jiu Feng Wang landed on a barren, rocky mountain.</p><p>The mountain was unremarkable, flat and less than a hundred meters high.  The lower part seemed imposing, but the top appeared to have been cleanly severed, leaving a strangely wide platform.  The summit was empty.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang stood at the peak, looking up at the sky.</p><p>The void was chaotic, filled with a turbulent aura, coalescing into dark grey clouds that blotted out the sun.</p><p>After a moment's contemplation, Jiu Feng Wang forced out a drop of blood, merging it with a Sky Phoenix feather.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Demonic fire reappeared, surging skyward.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang rapidly formed hand seals, channeling them into the fire. The flames began to contract, gradually taking the shape of a fire phoenix.</p><p>A strange aura emanated from it.</p><p>The fire phoenix let out a clear cry.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang seemed strained; as soon as the fire phoenix formed, he released it, guiding it with hand seals.</p><p>The fire phoenix spread its wings and soared.</p><p>Under the tense gaze of the other demons, the fire phoenix plunged into the clouds, until only flickering embers remained, faintly visible.</p><p>The next moment, the wind howled.</p><p>The clouds churned, forming a vortex that grew larger and larger.</p><p>A fierce wind raged. The demon kings channeled their spiritual energy for protection, all eyes on Jiu Feng Wang.</p><p>When the vortex reached tens of meters across, its depths unfathomable, Jiu Feng Wang finally said, “Go!”</p><p>All the demon kings flew into the vortex.</p><p>After a dizzying spin, the chaotic sounds ceased. The demon kings felt a lightness in their bodies as they entered an unfamiliar region.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Seeing the scene before them, Jiao Long Wang gasped.</p><p>The other demon kings also changed color, their bodies tensing as they stood rooted to the spot.</p><p>They were on a mountain, surrounded by chilling winds and darkness, matching their previous intel – the inner hall of the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>But what made the demon kings' hair stand on end was the sight of large and small spatial rifts floating nearby, like gaping maws, ready to devour everything!</p><p>These rifts were irregular, some as thin as silk, others stretching across the sky like clouds.</p><p>They even saw a long, snake-like rift writhing nearby – a moving rift!</p><p>And who knew how many invisible rifts lurked unseen?  Those were the most dangerous.</p><p>The demon kings’ scalps tingled; they felt an overwhelming urge to turn back.  Even beings as powerful as them felt fear in this dreadful place, knowing that a single misstep could mean death.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang, remaining relatively calm, surveyed the surroundings, saying gravely, “This terrain doesn’t match our intel. This mountain must be outside the human exploration zone. So many spatial rifts… it seems our luck is poor; we've entered the deepest part of the inner hall…”</p><p>“You don’t intend to force our way through this place, do you?”</p><p>The heavily armored man’s voice was dry, his heart heavy with apprehension.</p><p>“Let’s locate the True Dragon bones first. If it’s not too far, we have to try. See, the spatial instability is less on the ground. If we're careful and avoid flight, we might get through…”</p><p>Jiao Long Wang pointed to the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The demon kings looked, noticing fewer rifts there, but the area was filled with miasma, swamps, and flashing restrictions – hardly a safe place.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, protect me.”</p><p>Jiao Long Wang made his decision, preparing to use the Dragon-Summoning Art.</p><p>They stood before a stone wall, the entrance to the secret realm. There was no need to leave through this route, but Jiu Feng Wang was still making preparations.</p><p>The other demon kings dispersed to guard the area.</p><p>When all was ready, Jiao Long Wang held the dragon bone, silently chanting the incantation for the Dragon-Summoning Art. Golden light filled his palm, slowly seeping into the bone.</p><p>As the art progressed, the dragon bone shone brilliantly, as if coated in gold.</p><p>At this moment, Jiao Long Wang's eyes widened, and he spat out a golden ray of light that shot into the dragon bone.</p><p>Instantly, the golden ray and the golden light merged and erupted, with faint dragon roars echoing. The demon kings, prepared beforehand, tried to conceal the phenomenon, but a certain fluctuation was impossible to mask.</p><p>Fortunately, the surroundings remained quiet, and no ferocious beasts were attracted by this fluctuation.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang held the dragon bone, his eyes closed, concentrating on sensing the location of the true dragon corpse.</p><p>Time slowly slipped away.</p><p>After a short while, Jiao Long Wang's complexion worsened, his breath growing weaker, showing the significant energy consumption of this secret technique.</p><p>Finally, Jiao Long Wang opened his eyes, a gleam flashing within.</p><p>The dragon bone in his palm was pulsating, as if trying to escape his control and fly away. Jiao Long Wang ended the technique, the golden light gradually fading, and the dragon bone calmed down.</p><p>"I've found it!"</p><p>Jiao Long Wang turned towards the direction indicated by the dragon bone, exclaiming joyfully, "As expected, there's a dragon corpse in the inner chamber, not too far away.  Furthermore, from my observation, that should be the direction of the inner chamber's exit.  It seems the Yuan Ying cultivator obtained the dragon bone near the corpse. The further we go in that direction, the less dangerous it will be."</p><p>The demon kings had specifically investigated the inner chamber's terrain.</p><p>The inner chamber is vast; humans have only explored a small part near the entrance.</p><p>Though humans treat the inner chamber as their private domain,  some information has leaked out, allowing them to piece together a rudimentary map. Jiao Long Wang's claim is true; that direction is indeed the exit of the inner chamber, also the safest area within.</p><p>The demon kings were tempted. As long as they didn't venture too deep, even if they encountered a human Yuan Ying cultivator, the danger would be significantly less.  For the true dragon corpse, it was worth the risk.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang and Jiu Feng Wang had risked their lives sneaking into the Cang Lang Sea, so why hesitate now?</p><p>"As agreed, we'll take turns scouting the way. Does anyone object?"</p><p>Jiao Long Wang asked.</p><p>The demon kings exchanged glances.</p><p>The hulking demon with the shell-like back shook his head. "Agreed! You just used that secret technique; your true energy hasn't recovered yet. Let me go first."</p><p>With that, the hulking demon started down the mountain, the other demon kings ready to support him.</p><p>"Thank you, Hei Xiong!"</p><p>Jiao Long Wang bowed slightly.</p><p>He noticed Jiu Feng Wang's concerned gaze.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang sent a voice transmission, "Don't worry, my injuries have healed, thanks to the medicinal herbs you brought back from the Seven Kill Palace last time."</p><p>At this moment, the hulking demon sent a message, and the demon kings set off.</p>
