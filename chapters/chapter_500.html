<h1>Chapter 493: Desperate Struggle</h1><p>Chapter 493: Desperate Struggle</p><p>The Daoist in the crow-patterned robe felt a sudden, ominous premonition as he saw the妖异 (yaoyi - otherworldly, demonic) blood sword.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The ebony sword was a hair's breadth from the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>A flash of blood-polluting light erupted.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner was a large target, and the blood-polluting light struck the magical artifact directly.</p><p>The demonic fire on the banner's surface suddenly weakened, revealing the artifact's body. The black banner's luster dimmed rapidly, its spiritual essence greatly diminished.</p><p>Qin Sang had already tested the power of the blood-polluting light with the Ten Directions Yama Banner. Any magical artifact, no matter how high its grade, would be affected by it.</p><p>However, the higher the grade of the artifact, the shorter the duration and the weaker the effect of the blood-polluting light.</p><p>Against a top-grade artifact, the blood-polluting light would likely have little effect, unless Qin Sang also raised the ebony sword to a top-grade artifact.</p><p>But in a battle between cultivators, even a moment could change the tide, especially now.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The sword energy and thunderclap divine ability persisted.  Seizing the moment when the Ten Directions Yama Banner was damaged, the ebony sword forcefully pierced through the Nine Nether demonic fire, approaching the Daoist in the crow-patterned robe in an instant, under his terrified gaze.</p><p>*Whizz!*</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa followed closely behind, instantly closing in.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner, by itself, was only a low-grade artifact.</p><p>With its spiritual essence greatly diminished, the banner's power was now inferior to the ebony sword – barely adequate. The Nine Nether demonic fire, which was entangling the Flying Night Rakshasa, also weakened considerably, and the Rakshasa was no longer afraid.</p><p>The Daoist in the crow-patterned robe was caught off guard, momentarily flustered.  However, as a veteran Golden Core cultivator, he reacted swiftly in this perilous situation.</p><p>He suddenly swung the Ten Directions Yama Banner, throwing the artifact itself at the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>His eyes fixed on the ebony sword, his chest surging with frantic spiritual energy, his body twisting violently, he managed to narrowly avoid a fatal blow.</p><p>A muffled groan escaped his lips.</p><p>The ebony sword pierced the Daoist's left chest, drawing a spray of blood.</p><p>The sword energy within the Daoist's body failed to fully explode; he forcefully expelled most of it, and the remainder, not being fatal, was suppressed.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Flying Night Rakshasa relentlessly attacked the weakened artifact, further damaging it. The artifact was eventually knocked away, its banner even torn by the Rakshasa, now completely unusable.</p><p>The Daoist's breathing was ragged, his face pale, but his injuries were not life-threatening.</p><p>“Blood-polluting light!”</p><p>Recognizing the blood-polluting light divine ability of the ebony sword, the Daoist's eyes were filled with resentment and hatred.</p><p>He couldn't comprehend how a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator could possess so many extraordinary treasures. Not only a Flying Night Rakshasa, but also an artifact refined from the Interminable Blood Mulberry, forcing him into such a desperate situation.</p><p>Even early Golden Core cultivators rarely possessed such wealth.</p><p>At this moment, he had completely abandoned any thought of counterattacking and only wanted to escape.</p><p>But Qin Sang, having waited for this moment, would not let him get his wish.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed his advantage, ordering the ebony sword to continue its assault and coordinating with the Flying Night Rakshasa to attack.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang sensed the Daoist's retreat, and relentlessly commanded the Flying Night Rakshasa to press its attack against the Daoist despite the Nine Nether demonic fire.</p><p>The offensive was relentless.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa fought fearlessly, clinging to the Daoist, leaving no opening. Now it was the Daoist who was hampered, and with his lost artifact and injuries, he struggled to cope with this situation.</p><p>Demonic and corpse qi clashed, intertwining into a destructive force that raged through the valley.</p><p>The valley was ravaged.</p><p>The peach orchard was destroyed, its beauty utterly annihilated.</p><p>Qin Sang maneuvered the ebony sword, supporting the Flying Night Rakshasa in trapping the Daoist, but as the battle intensified, he gradually felt overwhelmed.</p><p>He sensed that the Daoist was fighting desperately.</p><p>The Daoist was a true Golden Core cultivator, and when he fought without reservation, solely focused on creating an escape route, his combat prowess was terrifying.</p><p>The battlefield situation changed in the blink of an eye. The ebony sword could only provide support and hadn't found an opportunity to attack for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang gave the Daoist in the crow-patterned robe a deep look.  Suddenly, he retracted his ebony sword, then refocused his attention on the Ten Directions Yama Formation. He retrieved the Ten Directions Yama Banner from his pouch.</p><p>He forced out a drop of his essence blood, his skin turning pale.</p><p>The ten main souls appeared, vying for his blood.  Their power surged rapidly as they jointly raised the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>A roaring sound filled the air. The Nine Netherworld Infernal Fire erupted again, but this time, Qin Sang was in control!  He couldn't wield the artifact as effortlessly as the crow-patterned Daoist, but he poured every ounce of his strength into it, unleashing a massive torrent of Nine Netherworld Infernal Fire into the fray.</p><p>“The Ten Directions Yama Banner!”</p><p>The demonic energy roiled in chaos, punctuated by the crow-patterned Daoist's incredulous screams.</p><p>“Who are you?!”</p><p>“Who are you?!”</p><p>“Who are you?!”</p><p>The crow-patterned Daoist shrieked repeatedly, his cries filled with disbelief, resentment, and fury, but Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>Deep within the demonic energy, three tornadoes suddenly erupted, scattering the Nine Netherworld Infernal Fire and crushing the Flying Yaksha.</p><p>Qin Sang could only vaguely sense the crow-patterned Daoist's condition.  He knew the Daoist was fighting desperately, and he couldn't let him escape. He ignored the potential destruction of the Flying Yaksha, giving only one order: attack!</p><p>The earth shook and mountains crumbled.  Even in Hanshan City, several mountains away, the ground trembled violently as if a dragon stirred beneath it. The river below surged into monstrous waves.</p><p>The city’s inhabitants, unaware of the catastrophe, panicked and filled with dread.</p><p>In the City Lord's Mansion, several figures stood atop the palace, gazing towards the valley. The most powerful among them was a white-haired elder, no more than early Foundation Establishment stage,  his age clearly showing.</p><p>They exchanged frightened glances.</p><p>A young man couldn’t help but ask, “Clan Chief, that's the direction of the forbidden area. What is there? What caused…”</p><p>The white-haired elder gripped his cane tightly, his knuckles white. He remained silent, his cloudy eyes filled with deep worry and terror.</p><p>In the valley, Qin Sang fought with a bloodlust.</p><p>He reached to his waist, summoning the three remaining late Foundation Establishment corpses he’d transformed into煞尸 (sha shi). They flew into the battle.</p><p>Soon, the first sha shi was destroyed.</p><p>Then the second.</p><p>And the third.</p><p>Qin Sang felt no sorrow. His eyes were bloodshot, his gaze fixed on the heart of the battle. He felt he was reaching his limit.  The main souls had consumed more of his essence blood; his body weakened, and his control over the Ten Directions Yama Banner was slipping.</p><p>The Flying Yaksha was repeatedly forced back, yet it always twisted back into the demonic energy. It fought desperately, its body ravaged with deep, gaping wounds.</p>
