<h1>Chapter 1809: Reflections in the Water</h1><p>Qin Sang's consciousness delved into the jade slip, and half a manual appeared in her mind.  It truly was a method of body refinement using poisons, but the manual had no name. Qing Dan Yuanjun claimed she had obtained it by chance, that it wasn't a true transmission from the Lougu Mountain sect, otherwise she wouldn't have given it to an outsider.  The first half was quite unique, but whether it was as miraculous as Qing Dan Yuanjun claimed remained to be seen, requiring the complete manual for confirmation.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade slip and observed the palace ahead.  The palace floated in the poisonous mist, seemingly drifting like the swirling mists themselves.  Qin Sang guessed there must be a connection and pattern between the swirling mists and the palace; the mists probably revolved around the palace.  Qing Dan Yuanjun had followed the mists for a long time, likely using them to locate the palace.</p><p>“Are there also flower fields and strange flower spirits inside the palace?”</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, adding to her vigilance.  From outside the palace, one couldn't see much. All the palaces were sealed by thick poisonous mist, even denser than the swirling mists.  Furthermore, the palaces undoubtedly contained powerful formations and prohibitions, merging with the poisonous mist to block external perception and investigation.</p><p>They could only see the roofs of the palaces and the exquisitely carved ridge beasts.  These beasts included wolves, tigers, leopards, dragons, phoenixes, and other auspicious creatures—no different from ordinary earthly palaces, offering no clues to their origins.</p><p>In the Jushan ritual grounds, except for the outermost golden hall, man-made halls and pavilions were extremely rare. Deep within the grounds, even if such structures existed, they were illusions created by the divine powers of ancient masters.  This place seemed different; at least neither Qin Sang nor the Tianmu butterfly detected any flaws.</p><p>The palace complex was extensive, yet the buildings were few, less than a hundred in total, large and small.  Several palaces extended from the courtyard to the rear, the largest likely being the main halls.</p><p>“Let’s enter from the courtyard,” Qing Dan Yuanjun said, her gaze fixed on the main halls.</p><p>Qin Sang finally couldn't help asking, “Shouldn’t the two of you tell me what you're actually looking for?”</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun hesitated for a moment. Since they were already here, there was no need for secrecy. She nodded. “I’m looking for a spirit tree. This tree is of great significance to my Lougu Mountain sect. I once saw a fleeting image of this tree within the palace, confirming its existence…”</p><p>She pointed towards the main halls. “The tree should be near those palaces. If you help me find it, I will not only give you the manual, but you two can have first pick of the treasures within the palace.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly.  They hadn't even entered yet, so the existence of treasures was unknown. It was premature to discuss this.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qing Dan Yuanjun paused, adding meaningfully, “I obtained this manual within the palace.”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.</p><p>So the manual came from here. Qing Dan Yuanjun knew how to use a gift to her advantage. If there was a manual, there might be other treasures.  Judging by her tone, she had only explored the outer areas of the palace before. Logically, the treasures in the core palaces would be of higher grade.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't deny her growing interest.</p><p>At that moment, a swirling mist drifted from afar.</p><p>The three waited for it to pass, then moved swiftly to the entrance of the palace courtyard.</p><p>The entrance should have had a gate, but whether Qing Dan Yuanjun had removed it or it was always like this, the empty doorway revealed the interior.</p><p>A garden!</p><p>Flowers bloomed in profusion, a riot of peach blossoms and willow greens.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang saw the garden, her heart tightened, and she instinctively stopped.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's reaction, the Bo Xian Shanren smiled. “When I first arrived, I reacted the same way, nearly getting a fright. Don’t worry, this garden is unlike the flower fields in the swirling mists. These are ordinary flowers, no flower spirits. However, once inside the palace, there's something to note. Unlike the outside, the poisonous mist here will silently invade us, gradually accumulating toxins. Don't underestimate it.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. “The inner and outer mists seem no different. So, the outer mist isn't non-toxic, but simply less accumulated?”</p><p>If that were true, Qin Sang needed to be vigilant, as her anti-poison armor wasn't reacting.</p><p>“Perhaps…”</p><p>The Bo Xian Shanren couldn't explain it. Following Qing Dan Yuanjun into the courtyard, Qin Sang followed slowly.</p><p>The garden was large and square.  Untended, yet the flowers thrived, none of them spirit flowers.  The garden's owner seemed to value appearance above all else.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun, familiar with the place, moved swiftly.</p><p>Qin Sang casually surveyed the palace grounds, finding no immediate danger.  At the garden's end was an archway.  According to Qing Dan Yuan Jun, the inner courtyard should lead directly to the main hall, connected by a series of such archways.</p><p>The archway was open, the path clear, but not easy to traverse.</p><p>She had divided the palace into nine sections. They had previously reached the seventh, and stopped there.</p><p>“Was the strange poison affecting your disciples from the main hall?” Qin Sang had sensed no similar energy along the way.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuan Jun and Bo Xian Shan Ren both frowned.</p><p>Bo Xian Shan Ren hesitated, “They did contract the poison escaping the palace, but whether the palace was the source, we remain unsure.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Qin Sang questioned.</p><p>“When the tremors struck, Qing Dan and I were stabilizing the formations for our disciples. The poison suddenly appeared around us, as if seeping from thin air…”</p><p>Bo Xian Shan Ren briefly explained the events.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned thoughtfully.</p><p>As they spoke, they entered the second section of the palace.  A series of banging sounds echoed around them.</p><p>Their enemies were the stone beasts guarding the garden, resembling statues of mythical creatures.  Their entry had stirred the creatures, unleashing a furious attack.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't intervene; Bo Xian Shan Ren and Qing Dan Yuan Jun could handle them, preserving Qin Sang's strength.</p><p>With unstoppable momentum, the three passed through six archways, reaching the seventh section – where they had previously stopped.</p><p>The seventh section differed drastically from the previous six.</p><p>There were no gardens here, just a wide passage between two stone walls, creating an oppressive atmosphere.</p><p>A straight passage led to another archway, guarded by two grotesquely shaped, menacing stone beasts.  The archway itself was sealed by a shimmering gate of light.</p><p>The light gate pulsed with a green glow in the poisonous mist, seemingly a fragile barrier.</p><p>The moment they entered the passage, a ‘click-click’ sound echoed ahead. The stone beasts twisted their necks, fixing them with their gaze.</p><p>An oppressive aura emanated from the beasts. Qin Sang’s expression turned serious; he knew these beasts were far stronger than the previous ones.</p><p>“To breach this gate, we need the Master’s power,” Bo Xian Shan Ren transmitted his planned strategy.</p><p>Qin Sang considered it briefly, then nodded in agreement.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuan Jun and Bo Xian Shan Ren exchanged relieved glances, heading towards the stone beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang remained behind, observing the light gate, deep in thought.</p><p>Midway through their advance, Qin Sang’s eyes flickered, his body pausing almost imperceptibly before resuming his forward movement.</p><p>Meanwhile, within his dantian, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s gaze fell upon the right-hand wall.</p><p>The walls of the passage were constructed of red bricks – but these were no ordinary walls.</p><p>During her first visit, Qing Dan Yuan Jun had attempted to bypass the stone beasts, finding no alternative route. She tried scaling and breaching the walls, only to enrage the beasts, attracting all the palace's stone creatures and narrowly escaping death.</p><p>She specifically warned Qin Sang to control his energy fluctuations and keep his distance from the walls when engaging the beasts.</p><p>Now, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly detected something unusual – a hidden door in the wall!</p><p>Qin Sang secretly activated his secret technique, assisting the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to confirm the discovery.</p><p>Where did the hidden door lead?</p><p>Even Qing Dan Yuan Jun was unaware of what lay beyond the wall.</p><p>Qin Sang remained outwardly calm, briefly scanning the backs of the two cultivators before refocusing on the light gate.</p><p>As they drew closer, the stone beasts revived, lunging forward with growls of warning.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuan Jun, seemingly unfazed, continued her advance. With a wave of her hand, water echoed through the passage.</p><p>Ripples spread through the air, concealing Qing Dan Yuan Jun's figure as she rapidly approached the beasts within the watery veil.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The intruders had crossed a line.</p><p>The stone beast roared, unleashing a ferocious attack, creating a huge splash, and disappearing along with Qing Dan Yuan Jun.</p><p>The other stone beast engaged Bo Xian Shan Ren.</p><p>The beasts seemed soaked in poison for ages; even simple attacks were venomous.  Bo Xian Shan Ren was shrouded in warm jade light, yet dared not let the beast come close.</p><p>Without antidotal skills, one would be heavily burdened and unable to fight effectively.</p><p>Seeing both beasts engaged, Qin Sang hesitated not, flashing towards the light gate.</p><p>Recalling the cultivators’ instructions, Qin Sang pressed his hands against the gate.</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang’s fingers were stained black-green, as if a potent poison was seeping into his body.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang had deliberately absorbed the poison.</p><p>Qing Tan Yuan Jun had attempted numerous times to overcome the poisonous barrier, Guang Men.  She finally conceived a plan: to absorb the potent poison herself, weakening its power.  But one person wasn't enough; they would succumb to the poison before breaching the barrier.  They needed others to share the burden.  This is why they valued Qin Sang's expertise in detoxification.</p><p>The poison entered Qin Sang's body, immediately suppressed by the power of the toxic bead within him.  The Guang Men's poison flowed into him; its luminescence subtly dimmed.  Qing Tan Yuan Jun and Bo Xian Shan Ren, locked in a desperate struggle with the stone beasts, anxiously watched Qin Sang.</p><p>To their relief, Qin Sang absorbed a massive quantity of poison, remaining outwardly unaffected, far from his limit.  The two were overjoyed.</p><p>As Qin Sang continued to absorb the poison, the stone beast let out a deafening roar.  The earth trembled violently. The tremor originated from behind; the roar awakened all the stone beasts within the palace.</p><p>“Quickly!” Bo Xian Shan Ren yelled.</p><p>Thousands of beasts charged from behind; time was critical.  Qin Sang's gaze hardened.  He instantly absorbed a massive amount of poison, his hands turning deep green, his fingernails nearly black.  He stepped back, retracting his hands.  Qin Sang withdrew, forcibly suppressing the intense poison within him. Without time to recover, he darted to the right,  Bo Xian Shan Ren immediately taking his place.</p><p>‘Whizz!’</p><p>Hui Ying Jian shot forth, transforming mid-flight into the Seven Constellations Divination Sword Formation, precisely encasing the oncoming stone beast.  Qin Sang glanced beyond the passageway, suppressing the poison while engaging the stone beast. The stone beast rampaged within the starry expanse of the sword formation, but could not escape.</p><p>Thanks to his swordsmanship inheritance and the meticulous guidance of the Sword Master, Qin Sang's understanding of the sword formation was unparalleled; he had mastered it a year ago!  The stone beasts couldn't be killed, only contained; the sword formation's full power wasn't needed yet.</p><p>Bo Xian Shan Ren lasted less than half the time Qin Sang did, retreating to allow Qing Tan Yuan Jun to take over.  This rotation continued for three cycles.  By then, countless stone beasts had stormed the passageway.</p><p>Simultaneously, the three launched a combined assault on the Guang Men. Qin Sang punched; Qing Tan Yuan Jun summoned a jade green staff; Bo Xian Shan Ren materialized a sharp spire using a divine talisman.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The three attacks struck the Guang Men simultaneously.  The barrier shattered amidst a thunderous explosion, crumbling into dust.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The three passed through the Guang Men, into a vast training ground.  The ground was remarkably empty; they could see an archway at the far end.  Unexpectedly, the final archway was open, unguarded by any stone beasts.</p><p>Qing Tan Yuan Jun was both surprised and delighted. She had prepared for the worst, planning to investigate the final archway's magical barrier first, before attempting entry.  Instead, they seemed to have direct access to the main hall!</p><p>‘Rumbling…’</p><p>The stone beasts charged into the training ground, their eyes bloodshot, relentlessly pursuing the intruders. The three didn’t hesitate, rushing towards the final archway and passing through effortlessly.</p><p>The surrounding chaos suddenly vanished.  They saw, in astonishment, that the frenzied stone beasts had stopped at the archway.  A dense mass of stone beasts filled the training ground, their roars echoing, but none dared cross the archway, as though an invisible barrier held them back.</p><p>The three exchanged glances, ignoring the stone beasts, their attention drawn to a spiritual tree in the courtyard.  The tree was small, only a person's height, seemingly immature. It bore no fruit; its leaves were curled into spheres, like hanging jade green lanterns, quite unique.</p><p>“That's it!”</p><p>Qing Tan Yuan Jun's eyes lit up with excitement.  Taking a deep breath, she started to approach the tree, then remembered something and handed a jade slip to Qin Sang. As per their agreement, the tree belonged to her.</p><p>The stone beasts' behavior prevented complacency.  After confirming the area around the tree was safe, Qing Tan Yuan Jun cautiously approached.</p><p>Bo Xian Shan Ren turned to Qin Sang, “Qing Feng Dao You, shall we each enter one of the two halls behind?”</p><p>Behind the tree, two ancient halls stood prominently at the center.</p><p>“Agreed!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  They each set up a protective spiritual array at the entrance of a hall.</p><p>The halls were identical; they chose one at random and approached the door. The barrier on the door was not poisonous.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a moment, nodding subtly.  Given time, breaking the barrier would be easy.  He channeled his True Essence, unleashing seals into the door. Multicolored lights erupted.  The barrier was gradually being broken.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression suddenly froze. He noticed subtle ripples emanating from the door, as if it were distorting.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, then his expression changed drastically. He spun around and shouted, “Stop!”</p><p>At that moment, Qing Tan Yuan Jun sat cross-legged before the spiritual tree, her hands gently cradling it, an invisible force enveloping the tree as she carefully uprooted it.</p><p>In an instant, the entire palace, along with the void itself, rippled, like a broken reflection in water!</p>
