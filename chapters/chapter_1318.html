<h1>Chapter 1310: Shadow in the Darkness</h1><p>Chapter 1310: Shadow in the Darkness</p><p>“Mere conjecture, spreading rumors!”</p><p>Master Cang Hong coldly snorted.</p><p>Master Zhen’s eyes suddenly lit up.  He transmitted a message to Qin Sang while replying, “Master, why the anger?  If Daoist Tian Zheng recovers as expected and reappears on the battlefield, the truth will be clear. We can afford to wait a little while. If Daoist Tian Zheng is unharmed, I will apologize to him on Daoist Qin’s behalf…”</p><p>From the start of the negotiations, Master Cang Hong had been aggressive, offering one tempting condition after another.</p><p>He obtained so much without lifting a finger, including the most important secret of Old Devil Ye.</p><p>Let's discuss further; by pressing Master Cang Hong, we might get a few more acceptable conditions.</p><p>The sudden upheaval in the Abyss of Sin makes their eagerness for negotiations understandable. They’ve been led by Master Cang Hong the entire time, and haven't thought deeply about it.</p><p>If Elder Tian Zheng was murdered by Old Devil Ye, the Abyss of Sin would be left with only Master Cang Hong as a top expert – a single tree cannot withstand the wind.  Furthermore, cultivators who have taken the Withering Essence Pill are constantly plagued by lingering effects, weakening the Abyss of Sin's strength further.</p><p>“We understand the Abyss of Sin’s terms, but we find it difficult to decide. There's no point in continuing today. Farewell!”</p><p>Everyone bowed, turned, and flew down from the cloud platform, leaving the Abyss of Sin’s members with ashen faces.</p><p>Master Zhen whispered, “The Star Constant Sect is the largest sect in the Abyss of Sin. I have planted spies within, though my position is far inferior to Daoist Qu’s, I can still detect any unusual activity there. Cang Hong's eagerness for negotiation suggests the news of Tian Zheng’s accidental death hasn't been kept secret. In a few days, we'll know the outcome…”</p><p>…</p><p>The Sin God Palace.</p><p>An unknown, dark-shrouded secret realm.</p><p>Pitch black, deathly silent.</p><p>A musty smell permeated the air.</p><p>Suddenly, a ball of blood-red light flashed in the darkness, then vanished, swallowed again by the blackness.</p><p>What followed was a faint sound of footsteps, as if someone were slowly approaching the depths of the darkness.</p><p>‘Rustle… rustle…’</p><p>The footsteps grew clearer, each step precisely timed.</p><p>As the figure drew closer, a sigh echoed from the dark depths.</p><p>“After all these years? You’ve finally come…”</p><p>The voice was raspy, like two pieces of metal scraping together, like the sound of a parched person lost in the desert.</p><p>Another person, evidently trapped here for a long time.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The void trembled slightly.</p><p>Then, a beam of azure light erupted. The source of the azure glow was an ancient restriction, sealing the speaker within.</p><p>The mysterious person attempted to break the seal, triggering the restriction's power.</p><p>The newcomer stopped at the edge of the restriction.  His pale face, half-illuminated by the azure light and half shrouded in darkness, was strikingly eerie. It was Old Devil Ye!</p><p>Old Devil Ye breathed heavily, his robes torn and stained with blood.  Being pursued by Master Cang Hong had taken its toll, his injuries were severe.</p><p>However, his expression was calm, his eyes indifferent to his wounds, as he looked down at the ancient restriction.</p><p>Inside the restriction was also an endless darkness, nothing visible.</p><p>The mysterious person’s emotions suddenly became intensely agitated.  He screamed in a grating voice, “What about the things I asked for? Did you get them?”</p><p>Old Devil Ye remained silent, throwing an object.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A skeleton landed on the ground – the Jade Bone, Brocade Skin.</p><p>He had brought it in as well.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>The mysterious person screamed in anguish.</p><p>He seemed to be examining the Jade Bone, Brocade Skin, falling silent for a moment before bursting into laughter. “As expected! My younger brother, to save his life, must have practiced this secret technique, refining his own flesh! Too bad, too bad, without the blood food, he almost failed to complete the Jade Bone. However, this body is enough to help me withstand the seal and break free! Have you seen him? Did you tell him it was I who led you there?”</p><p>The mysterious person gloated, their hatred evident.</p><p>Old Devil Ye looked down at the left foot of the Jade Bone, Brocade Skin.</p><p>The little toe on the left foot was incongruous with the rest of the jade bone; it wasn't jade, but a blood bone.</p><p>“When I went in, his consciousness had already vanished,” Old Devil Ye shook his head,  “But he has been tirelessly searching for blood food. If he devoured several more Nascent Souls, killing him would likely be difficult.”</p><p>“He’s dead, long ago?”</p><p>The mysterious man’s voice suddenly dropped, falling silent for a moment before continuing, “Just this jade bone isn't enough. What else? Time is running out! Looking at your sorry state, not only are you severely injured, but even your Blood Demon avatar was killed. Did you fail? Back then, you stubbornly went your own way, guarding against me with all your might, quite a big mouth you had!”</p><p>Ye Laomo’s eyes flashed with disdain.  He flicked his sleeve, and streams of light flew out.</p><p>Among the light were spherical crystal balls—the core of the Youjing Tower.</p><p>The rest were Nascent Souls, alive but imprisoned by Ye Laomo.</p><p>These Nascent Souls were filled with resentment, wishing to devour his flesh and skin, but they were all bound, powerless to resist. All they could do was curse Ye Laomo with the vilest imprecations.</p><p>Seeing the crystal ball and the Nascent Souls, the mysterious man’s tone immediately changed. He clicked his tongue in admiration, “Good! Good! I didn't expect you actually did it.  Manipulating the world—truly ruthless!  As expected of someone who could escape my control and even plot against me!”</p><p>Ye Laomo remained unmoved, his face devoid of any triumph. He countered, “You’ve gathered everything you need. What’s the next step?”</p><p>“What’s the hurry? The time isn't right. Just help me leave this cursed place, and I will tell you everything, without hiding a single detail.”</p><p>The ancient prison flickered incessantly. The mysterious man was growing impatient.  “Everything is ready, all we need is the east wind!  Just throw the jade bone over and help me break free!”</p><p>But Ye Laomo ignored the mysterious man’s urging, sitting cross-legged and calmly saying, “Since the time isn't right, let’s wait until it is before releasing you.”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>The mysterious man exploded with rage.</p><p>The ancient prison trembled violently, but Ye Laomo closed his eyes, meditating, seemingly oblivious.</p><p>After venting his fury, the mysterious man calmed down, suddenly chuckling sarcastically, “Help me break the seal now. I can recover some of my strength during this time, improving my chances. This is your only opportunity. You’ve painstakingly schemed for nearly a thousand years. If you miss this chance, can you really accept it? What are you afraid of? I solemnly swore to you, I will never harm you.  I'll even let you leave a restriction on me.  Heart Demon Oath, Karmic Vow… I’ve made them all.”</p><p>Ye Laomo lifted his eyelids, finally deigning to open his eyes.</p><p>“Heart Demon Oaths, as far as I know, aren’t unbreakable. As for Karmic Vows…”</p><p>He paused.</p><p>Ye Laomo glanced at the Nascent Souls floating around him, finally settling on the most prominent one—Tian Zheng Lao Ren.</p><p>Unlike the others’ hysterical terror and resentment, Tian Zheng Lao Ren’s Nascent Soul sat calmly, peacefully awaiting its fate.</p><p>Ye Laomo looked deeply at Tian Zheng Lao Ren and decisively declared, “Ye Mou doesn’t believe in Karma!”</p><p>The ancient prison glowed brightly, then gradually dimmed.</p><p>Silence returned.</p>
