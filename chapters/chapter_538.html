<h1>Chapter 531: Sealing the Mountain</h1><p>The Gangyu stones are quite unique.  </p><p>When undisturbed, their texture is extremely hard.</p><p>The Gangyu Qin Sang had chosen was originally the size of a baby, and it only shattered after he absorbed almost all the Gang Qi within it.</p><p>After leaving Divine Gang Peak, however, they could not survive and would immediately disintegrate.</p><p>It wouldn't be easy to bring those Gangyu stones down Divine Gang Peak while ensuring his own safety.</p><p>The stability of the Ancestral Sacred Fire is related to the Gangyu stones.</p><p>The Ancestral Sacred Fire itself also protects the Gangyu stones.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly activated his true energy, his figure flashing past. He discovered his speed had dramatically increased, now comparable to a true Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>He had a sudden thought, and the Ebony Sword flew from his brow, silently appearing before him.</p><p>True energy was also his power, and it didn’t affect his use of the Ebony Sword.  With a thought, the Ebony Sword's light flickered, instantly circling his body once before quickly returning to its original position, as if it hadn't moved at all.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang extended his right hand.</p><p>The Ebony Sword flashed and landed in Qin Sang's palm, then transformed into a sword light, like a playful fish, nimbly swimming around his fingertips.</p><p>Qin Sang’s lips curled into a satisfied smile.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was his natal treasure. In the False Core stage, although he could use it, it still placed a significant burden on him, and he couldn't unleash its true power.</p><p>Now, it was different.</p><p>He could easily wield the Ebony Sword to perform various sword techniques without any difficulty!</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn't use the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability. Otherwise, what would he fear from a mere early Golden Core opponent?</p><p>They simply couldn't catch him!</p><p>Right, there's also the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently. The Ebony Sword's greatest value now lay in the Blood-Soiled Divine Light ability inherent to the spiritual sword; it could unexpectedly cause his opponent a great deal of trouble.</p><p>But to directly engage that Golden Core cultivator in battle, he'd still need the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect's Qingyang Demon Fire is quite tricky.  Using the Ebony Sword against a Golden Core level demon fire would likely be ineffective. The Ten Directions Yama Banner, however, contains Nine Nether Demon Fire, another strange fire, a perfect counter.</p><p>Anyway, he currently had a monstrous appearance, so even with keen eyes, that Golden Core cultivator wouldn't be able to recognize him.</p><p>Moreover, he now possessed Golden Core-level power; the situation had changed drastically. Openly using the Ten Directions Yama Banner wouldn't bring any further trouble.</p><p>However, the Ten Directions Yama Banner was buried outside the Qingyang Demon Sect, so he first needed to get out.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his finger, retracting the Ebony Sword, and took out the Void Heaven Thunder from his bosom, intending to use his movement techniques to return to the inner sect of the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>I wonder what the situation is like in the inner sect of the Qingyang Demon Sect now?</p><p>Having only traveled a short distance, Qin Sang suddenly felt something, abruptly turning his head. He saw that at the Qingyang Demon Sect’s mountain gate, white clouds were suddenly swirling, then separating to the sides. Soon, the stone stele was exposed to Qin Sang's view.</p><p>Seeing the six Foundation Establishment cultivators seated around the stele, Qin Sang realized the array eye was there, and cursed inwardly, These six people are incredibly calm.</p><p>With the anomaly on Divine Gang Peak, they’re still sitting there.</p><p>If they had been drawn away by Divine Gang Peak, he would have escaped long ago!</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, there were originally eight people there.</p><p>They actually knew about the Divine Gang Peak anomaly. After two of their fellow disciples entered the mountain and went missing, two others rushed back to rescue them, and soon brought back news.</p><p>Now the Qingyang Demon Sect was in chaos.  Two people remained on Divine Gang Peak to comfort the other disciples.</p><p>The others knew they lacked the ability to solve the problem or rescue their fellow disciples.</p><p>The Divine Gang Peak anomaly hadn't reached an uncontrollable state. They knew that in times like these, it was crucial to remain calm.</p><p>After discussion, they decided to obey Master Wu’s orders before he left, firmly guarding the mountain gate and swiftly sending news to Master Wu, requesting his return to take charge.</p><p>The mountain gate opened.</p><p>Qin Sang saw the six Foundation Establishment cultivators stand up in unison, forming a line, bowing to the outside of the mountain gate. Immediately afterward, a streak of rainbow light shot from the distant horizon, brilliant as a meteor!</p><p>It was that Golden Core cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed sharply, unexpectedly, the person had returned so quickly.</p><p>His expression changed rapidly. He suddenly flashed his figure, hiding in the woods, and then suppressed his aura, slowly approaching the mountain gate.</p><p>“Disciples greet Master Wu!”</p><p>The Golden Core cultivator didn't walk up the steps, the rainbow light directly flying to the mountain gate.</p><p>Those present didn't dare to say anything, instead respectfully bowing.</p><p>“What's going on?”</p><p>Before the rainbow light even arrived, an angry and furious question echoed, deafening, reverberating through the mountains.</p><p>The rainbow light settled before the six, then vanished, revealing a cultivator surnamed Wu, his face burning with anger.</p><p>As the saying goes, environment shapes character.  A Nascent Soul cultivator, even if initially unremarkable in appearance and unconcerned with their looks, possesses an inherent aura that overshadows any physical flaws.  There are exceptions, of course, such as those whose cultivation techniques affect their temperament—a phenomenon most common among demonic and heretical cultivators.</p><p>This cultivator, Wu Youdao, was brought to the Qingyang Demonic Sect as a child. While not the most gifted among his peers, he alone achieved Nascent Soul cultivation, becoming the sect's fourth such master. Others with greater talent either struggled in the False Core stage or ventured out seeking opportunities, only to disappear without a trace.</p><p>Wu Youdao, by nature, wasn't one to show his anger openly. Yet, he felt an overwhelming urge to lash out. This was his first time guarding the mountain gate alone after achieving Nascent Soul.  He had been cultivating peacefully in his cave...</p><p>First, a sudden beast horde erupted in the Wuyaya Valley, endangering several promising disciples, forcing him to rescue them. The Qingyang Demonic Sect, unlike the larger sects, couldn't afford to lose any disciple with potential for Nascent Soul.</p><p>Barely had he arrived at Wuyaya Valley when news arrived: the Ancestral Sacred Flame had become unstable!</p><p>Exhausted and exasperated, Wu Youdao felt the heavens were conspiring against him.  He was in no mood for anyone.</p><p>The six noticed his fury, fearing they might become targets for his ire. Trembling, they reported, "Reporting to Uncle-Master Wu, we eight followed your instructions and sealed the mountain gate.  The Ancestral Sacred Flame suddenly showed signs of instability. Disciples Dong and Zhu went to investigate and, for reasons unknown, were trapped by the flame. Fortunately, the flame itself remains stable. Two other disciples are calming the others. The cause of the instability is still unknown..."</p><p>"When I left, Shen Gang Peak was perfectly normal.  I'll see what's going on…"</p><p>Wu Youdao coldly snorted, waving his sleeve, about to fly back to the inner sect, then remembered something and said coldly, "After Li Qing returns, do not spare the spirit stones. Seal the mountain immediately, until the Sect Master returns! These are turbulent times, and I don't have the energy to repeatedly go out and rescue people.  Did you hear me?"</p><p>The six exchanged glances and replied in unison, "Yes, Uncle-Master!"</p>
