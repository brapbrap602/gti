<h1>Chapter 662: Golden Orchid Grass</h1><p>Qin Sang flipped his hand, revealing a crystal in his palm, as clear as ice.</p><p>Channeling his True Essence into the crystal, it trembled abruptly. A milky white light bloomed within, then displayed a vivid scene.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the crystal.</p><p>The Sky Tower stood tall, and a mutilated ancient corpse plummeted from the sky.</p><p>Through the thick sea of clouds, only a vague shadow of the corpse could be seen, shrouded in dense death Qi. Even the white clouds were stained a grotesque color by the aura.</p><p>Just as the armless corpse was about to fall out of the clouds, it vanished.</p><p>The next moment, several powerful figures soared into the sky, only to be blocked beneath the sea of clouds, unable to enter. They hovered in mid-air.</p><p>At this point, the scene in the crystal abruptly ended.</p><p>Why did the corpse suddenly disappear from the Seven Kills Hall and reappear on the distant Shaman Continent? This huge mystery lingered in Qin Sang's mind, refusing to dissipate.</p><p>Was there a peculiar restriction in the Seven Kills Hall that transported him here?</p><p>Or was there a mysterious person in the Sky Tower who took him out of the Seven Kills Hall and threw him here?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand, but he realized that the ancient teleportation formation was probably at the top of the Sky Tower. He had wasted his time in the Western Frontier.</p><p>To understand the reason and find the ancient teleportation formation, he had to enter the Seven Kills Hall himself.</p><p>The next opening of the Seven Kills Hall would be decades later, during a low tide in the protective immortal formation, when other factions would have a chance to force their way in.</p><p>During this time, the most important thing for Qin Sang was to increase his strength as much as possible.</p><p>Although he couldn't get all the information about the Seven Kills Hall from Du Han, he could glimpse the danger within. Every step was fraught with peril, comparable to the outer halls of the Violet Palace.</p><p>It was definitely not a paradise like the inner halls of the Violet Palace.</p><p>At the early stage of Core Formation, he was only at the bottom rung among the cultivators who entered the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>"With the cultivation speed of the 'Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture,' as long as I cultivate diligently, decades should be enough for me to break through to the middle stage of Core Formation. After all, this cultivation method has no bottlenecks in minor realms... I need to go to the Demonic Sea as soon as possible."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured. The Storm Demonic Sea was the most suitable place for him to cultivate. He could comprehend the Killing Talismans while exchanging demonic beasts for spirit stones.</p><p>Qin Sang was worried. If the Sky Tower was as dangerous as the rumors said, would he have to wait until he reached the Nascent Soul stage before he had a chance to return to the Small Cold Region?</p><p>Without the Tribulation Avoidance Pill, what were his chances of reaching Nascent Soul?</p><p>Qin Sang had a severe headache.</p><p>He was also secretly relieved.</p><p>It was said that the white clouds at the top of the Sky Tower were unique, containing ancient restrictions. Even Nascent Soul ancestors couldn't penetrate the sea of clouds with their divine sense.</p><p>They couldn't use divine sense to probe the identity of the corpse.</p><p>With the naked eye, through the hazy sea of clouds and the dense death Qi, not only could they not see the corpse's face, but because of its curled-up posture, they couldn't even make out its form.</p><p>Because the death Qi was too heavy, and because it fell from the desolate top of the Sky Tower, anyone who witnessed it wouldn't think it was a living person.</p><p>After his arm recovered and the death Qi was purged, no one would associate Qin Sang with that armless corpse.</p><p>After learning that the Seven Kills Hall and the ancient corpse were closely related and under scrutiny, Qin Sang had been very nervous, afraid of being seen through and having difficulty moving around the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Seeing the scene in the crystal, he was finally relieved.</p><p>From Du Han, he learned that after the armless corpse disappeared, a Nascent Soul ancestor believed that the corpse had been stolen in broad daylight, which almost caused a great disturbance.</p><p>Du Han didn't know how those Nascent Soul ancestors negotiated, but a major conflict didn't erupt.</p><p>After the Seven Kills Hall closed, some human factions spread the news of searching for the armless corpse. Du Han and the others then realized that those human Nascent Soul ancestors hadn't found the corpse.</p><p>After returning to the Shaman Continent, they immediately reported the changes in the Seven Kills Hall to their sects, wanting to emulate the humans and search for the armless corpse on the Shaman Continent.</p><p>What if it landed on the Shaman Continent?</p><p>The Seven Kills Hall was one of the most important secret realms of the human race, and the armless corpse might hold some secrets.</p><p>Those who had been to the Seven Kills Hall had limited power and couldn't organize the entire Shaman Continent's forces. They needed the support of Nascent Soul ancestors.</p><p>After Du Han reported to his sect, there was no response. He later learned that his master was in closed-door cultivation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after contacting others, he found that the other sects were the same. The Nascent Soul ancestors of the major sects had all chosen to enter closed-door cultivation at this time.</p><p>There was even a prominent sect, ranked among the top three of the Shaman race, whose Nascent Soul ancestors were all in seclusion.</p><p>Such a coincidence was impossible!</p><p>They immediately realized that those Nascent Soul ancestors might have left their sects long ago, secretly plotting something extremely important.</p><p>The Shaman race wasn't a monolithic entity. What great matter could involve the entire Shaman leadership?</p><p>Compared to a matter concerning the entire Shaman race, what was the armless corpse?</p><p>The Shaman race choosing this time to act secretly was likely to take advantage of the human race's attention being drawn to the Seven Kills Hall, making it easier to deceive them.</p><p>After learning this, Qin Sang immediately put it aside.</p><p>Although he was human, he wasn't from the Boundless Sea region. He wouldn't risk exposing himself to reveal anything.</p><p>Moreover, the Shaman race hadn't deliberately concealed their actions, probably just needing a little time and not fearing discovery by the human race. Their goal was likely already achieved.</p><p>With the Shaman Nascent Soul ancestors disappearing, the human spies within the Shaman race must have already discovered the Shaman's unusual activity. Qin Sang didn't need to intervene.</p><p>Without the support of their sects, Du Han and the others could only contact some fellow Daoists and choose less dangerous areas to gather information, hoping for a stroke of luck.</p><p>To conduct a large-scale search across the Shaman territory, they had to wait for the Nascent Soul ancestors to return to their sects before making a decision.</p><p>The area Du Han chose was the northern Western Frontier, including the Bear Mountain region. Some of Du Han's fellow Daoists and sect brothers were also scattered throughout the Western Frontier to investigate.</p><p>The Western Frontier was vast, and the local cultivators weren't very powerful, so they naturally had to search carefully.</p><p>The reason Du Han chose this area was twofold.</p><p>First, in the Seven Kills Hall, he bought information from a newly acquainted human Core Formation cultivator about a Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit hidden in the Bear Mountain region, which could help his chief disciple reach Core Formation.</p><p>Second, it was because of a medicinal herb called Golden Orchid Grass.</p><p>Golden Orchid Grass wasn't particularly valuable in itself.</p><p>Later, cultivators discovered that Golden Orchid Grass had a certain effect on the demonic Qi that corroded the Primordial Spirit, and its value immediately skyrocketed. Now, it had been completely plundered and become quite rare.</p><p>Du Han had discovered this Golden Orchid Grass by chance in the heartland of the Western Frontier. At the time, it hadn't reached its peak potency, so he had to kill the guardian spirit beast and set up restrictions to conceal the herb's aura.</p><p>Recently, the Golden Orchid Grass matured. After returning to the Shaman Continent, Du Han couldn't wait to harvest it himself.</p>
