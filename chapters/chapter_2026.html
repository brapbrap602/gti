<h1>Chapter 2017: A Fleeting Silhouette</h1><p>“I can’t hide it from Senior's discerning eyes,” Qu Zhen replied respectfully. “It is indeed related to the Sword Pavilion.  We were fortunate enough to discover a hidden land, highly likely a fragment of the ancient Sword Pavilion, and it seems no one has set foot there before. But the interior is fraught with peril, and we dare not explore deeply. I wonder if Senior might be interested.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Qu Zhen, his gaze profound. “This old man is a complete stranger to you.  You dare to tell me these secrets and invite me to explore the ancient Sword Pavilion with you?  Aren’t you afraid this old man will hoard all the treasures for himself, leaving you with nothing?”</p><p>“There are three reasons why I invited Senior.”</p><p>Facing Qin Sang's almost threatening words, Qu Zhen's expression didn't fluctuate in the slightest. He calmly explained,</p><p>“Firstly, we have been exploring that place, attempting to obtain the treasures without external assistance. However, our strength is insufficient, and we have suffered repeated defeats, unfortunately losing a few fellow Daoists.  With the increasing number of experts drawn to the Sword Pavilion, if we delay any longer, that place will inevitably be exposed, and someone else will take the lead.  Rather than letting others seize it, it's better for us to offer it ourselves. After our last unsuccessful attempt, we discussed seeking the assistance of a powerful Senior like yourself upon returning to Yumen Pass.  It was by chance that we encountered Elder Qin.”</p><p>“Secondly, we have long recognized the truth: treasures under heaven belong to those with virtue. If Elder Qin obtains benefits, surely you wouldn't mind sharing a small portion with us. With the ancient Sword Pavilion’s profound resources, even a sliver of its wealth would greatly benefit us.”</p><p>“Thirdly, we are not entirely without precautions. The Five Elements Alliance has a good reputation throughout Due Province. As an elder of the Five Elements Alliance, Senior must be someone who values their reputation and is more trustworthy than others. Moreover, we are still of use to Elder Qin.”</p><p>These words were both courteous and measured.  However, Qin Sang doubted that Hengsha Society, having been entrenched in Yumen Pass for so many years, couldn't find other Void Refinement cultivators.  He noncommittally said, "Take this old man to see it."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Qu Zhen stepped forward to lead the way.</p><p>Qin Sang also slowed his escape technique, following Qu Zhen and listening to his description of the Sword Pavilion fragment.</p><p>He had personally visited the Purple Star Palace and Seven Kills Hall, two of the five Sword Pavilions in the Storm Realm.  He also had some understanding of the Celestial Harmony Hall and Celestial Appearance Hall in Zhong Province, gained through the Sweet Dew Monastery and Eight Sceneries View.</p><p>After Qu Zhen's detailed description, Qin Sang tried to find a match in his memory but still couldn't determine which Sword Pavilion the fragment originated from.</p><p>As they continued deeper, Qu Zhen gradually slowed down, his movements becoming increasingly cautious.  At this location, even Nascent Soul cultivators rarely traveled alone, usually choosing to travel in groups.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang cast a protective Qi shield on Qu Zhen.  Qu Zhen's heart initially tightened, and he hurriedly bowed, saying, "Thank you, Elder Qin, for your protection."</p><p>With Qin Sang's protection, Qu Zhen's speed immediately increased.  After traveling a further distance, Qin Sang suddenly called out, "Wait."</p><p>Then, Qin Sang gestured for Qu Zhen to stay put.  He looked around and flew towards a particular illusory landscape formed by divine abilities.</p><p>Qu Zhen didn't understand the reason but didn't dare to ask, patiently waiting.</p><p>After entering the illusory landscape, Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, and the Vermillion Bird rolled out, letting out an excited chirp.  It eagerly spread its wings, soaring freely, enjoying its freedom, and staring at Qin Sang with resentful eyes.</p><p>After entering the Great Zhou Dynasty, Qin Sang had been worried about this fellow's impulsive nature causing trouble, keeping it constantly by his side and strictly forbidding it from going out, which had left it feeling stifled.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the Vermillion Bird's resentment and handed it a cartographic chart.</p><p>“You take Luo Hou and the others, and go through all these places. Explore as deeply as possible and record the surrounding environment.”</p><p>Qin Sang categorized the selected locations by importance.  The most crucial ones were naturally assigned to those he trusted the most.  The Vermillion Bird and the two Demon Marquises working together were more than capable of protecting themselves here.</p><p>The two Demon Marquises had already switched to cultivating the "Celestial Demon Body Refinement" technique. The allure of this technique was undeniable for any demon cultivator.  It could even be said that, because of this technique, they saw a glimmer of hope for reaching Void Refinement.  Unless there was a greater temptation, Qin Sang wasn't worried about their betrayal.</p><p>However, he was still a bit uneasy about the Vermillion Bird.</p><p>“You are also aware of the forces behind the Purple Star Palace. There’s no room for error, so you’d better behave yourself.  In the vast world, humans and demons are mortal enemies, especially a divine beast variant like you.  If a powerful being captures you, no one can save you, and the Qilin Origin Seed will be mine alone."</p><p>The Vermillion Bird snorted.  Qin Sang was clearly underestimating it. It wasn't stupid; its arrogance was also dependent on the time and the opponent.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang preparing for another escape, the Vermillion Bird grumbled discontentedly, “Following you, there’s never a day of peace!”</p><p>Qin Sang pretended not to hear. He opened the altar, releasing the two Demon Marquises and the Fire Jade Centipede, ordering them to act together with the Vermillion Bird.</p><p>"Take these two people with you. If you sense danger, let them scout ahead."</p><p>Qin Sang tossed down the two captives and transmitted the method of controlling the restrictive spells to the two Demon Marquises, ensuring the captives would obediently follow orders.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird, perched on the centipede’s back, pointed its wings forward and shouted majestically. The two Demon Marquises bowed to Qin Sang and chased after it with the captives.</p><p>Qin Sang then returned to the original spot, beckoned Qu Zhen, and continued towards the Sword Pavilion fragment.</p><p>After some detours, they finally reached their destination.  A multi-colored radiance appeared before them. The location was extremely secluded; it was no wonder others hadn't found it.  Qin Sang wondered how the Hengsha Society had discovered it.</p><p>The Sword Pavilion fragment lay within the radiance. These shimmering lights reminded Qin Sang of the Immortal Restrictions within the inner hall of the Seven Kills Hall, but according to Qu Zhen's description, there shouldn't be any connection between the two.</p><p>“Elder Qin, this is the safest path we found after numerous explorations,” Qu Zhen volunteered, leading the way into the radiance from one side.</p><p>Surrounded by brightly colored radiance, they passed through the shimmering light.  A mountain peak stood before them, and beyond it, more mountains, each taller than the last, rose like towering walls, obscuring the scenery behind.</p><p>"Ancient restrictions are layered heavily on the mountains. We reached the foot of the last mountain at our furthest point," Qu Zhen pointed behind him. "Although we don't know what lies beyond the mountains, we encountered two strange occurrences. A strange light erupted from behind the mountains, gushing like a spring. It resembled the radiant glow of some treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed intently, observing that these mountain peaks were all bare, their ancient restrictions almost completely shattered.</p><p>Shattered ancient restrictions weren't difficult to break, but they were more dangerous, full of uncertainty.</p><p>Without much effort, Qin Sang brought Qu Zhen to the foot of the last mountain.</p><p>Looking up at the summit, chaotic auras floated in the void, precisely where the fluctuations of the ancient restrictions were most intense. The auras shifted erratically; even the slightest disturbance could trigger a storm. Without sufficient strength, forcing entry would be a dead end.</p><p>Qu Zhen looked at Qin Sang, who only pondered for a moment before saying calmly, "Follow behind me."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang stepped onto the mountain. He noticed a stone staircase on his left, leading directly to the summit. The dilapidated stone steps exuded an archaic aura, having endured countless years.</p><p>Stepping onto the staircase, Qin Sang chose to walk, his pace leisurely, like an ordinary mountaineer.  Qu Zhen didn't dare to be as relaxed as Qin Sang, following closely behind him.</p><p>Following Qin Sang, the dangers that had once terrified them were easily dispelled.  The two smoothly ascended to the summit and finally saw the scene beyond the mountain.</p><p>Beyond the mountain was a boundless mire.  Apart from the filth, there was nothing else. The mud churned, like a constantly shaking mud pit, the mire stirred to pieces, nauseating.</p><p>The moment he stepped onto the summit, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly narrowed. He reached out to grasp the void but only caught a handful of air.</p><p>“Elder Qin?”</p><p>Qu Zhen saw Qin Sang's action, unsure what he was doing.</p><p>"There's poison here," Qin Sang said.  His tone revealed no unusual emotion, but his heart was already in turmoil.</p><p>A type of toxin permeated the void, but it was extremely thin, practically imperceptible to ordinary people, and indistinguishable to the naked eye.</p><p>Qin Sang had only encountered this poison in one place: the Gloomy Valley, one of the three toxic lands within the Seven Kills Hall! The Spirit Suppression Domain and Sky-Supporting Peak, where Senior Qing Zhu had left his last testament after the Demon Sealing Battle, were located within the Gloomy Valley!</p><p>"Could this really be the Seven Kills Hall?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept inch by inch over the mire.</p><p>From this perspective, the Sword Pavilion fragments discovered within the Abundant Obstacles Jade Gate were likely fragments of the five Sword Pavilions, torn apart and peeled off by the void during their ascension, luckily escaping destruction and scattering throughout the Abundant Obstacles Jade Gate.</p><p>It seemed he would have to visit those Sword Pavilion fragments; perhaps among them were places he had been before. Qin Sang pondered, leading Qu Zhen down the mountain.</p><p>The toxin was extremely dilute, its lethality greatly diminished, posing no threat to them. Qu Zhen simply assumed Qin Sang was reminding him to pay attention to the source of the toxin and didn't think too deeply about it.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang traversed the mire, reaching its edge.  Unfortunately, he didn't find anything else related to the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>“Have you searched the vicinity?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Qu Zhen nodded. “We’ve searched thoroughly.  There’s only this one fragment here. Other Sword Pavilion fragments are also scattered far apart. It's said that the fragments are scattered everywhere, and many have collided with illusory landscapes formed by divine abilities and been destroyed.”</p><p>Returning to the center of the mire, Qin Sang reached down and grabbed.  The mud churned, and a skeleton surfaced.</p><p>The skeleton belonged to a beast, similar in size to a tiger or leopard, with a fissure on its forehead.  Within the fissure, light shimmered.</p><p>With a ‘crack,’ the skull split open, and a round bead flew out—a Demon Core.</p><p>"The radiant glow you saw before should be this."</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned the Demon Core into his hand. Judging by the luster of the skeleton and the Demon Core, the creature’s cultivation level before death was likely at the mid to late Nascent Soul stage. It had been dead for a long time, but not too long.</p><p>Even more surprisingly, it was the skeleton of a ferocious beast!  Qin Sang had hunted countless ferocious beasts in the Talisman World and was extremely familiar with this aura.</p><p>Was it a ferocious beast that had strayed into the Abundant Obstacles Jade Gate when the Sword Pavilion ascended and passed through the River of Misfortune, or did ferocious beasts always exist within the Seven Kills Hall?  If they were reared by the Seven Kills Hall, it was fortunate they weren't released, otherwise, the entire Boundless Wave Sea would have been plunged into chaos.</p><p>The Sword Pavilions held countless unsolved mysteries, and now there was one more.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the skeleton to Qu Zhen. “This skeleton is the only treasure here.  This old man will keep the Demon Core.  The rest is yours.”</p><p>The skeleton of a Nascent Soul ferocious beast was excellent spiritual material, a considerable gain for the Hengsha Society.</p><p>"Thank you, Elder Qin!"</p><p>Qu Zhen collected the skeleton, looking thoughtfully at Qin Sang's back.  It seemed this Elder Qin was indeed someone who valued his reputation.</p><p>Of course, they couldn't truly trust a stranger at the Void Refinement stage. Although they couldn't cross the mountain peak before, they had also used other means to determine that the radiant glow didn't belong to a supreme treasure.</p><p>This trip was actually a test.  The Hengsha Society, deeply rooted in the Abundant Obstacles Jade Gate for many years, had found more than just this one Sword Pavilion fragment. They had another, more important one, clearly of extraordinary origin, quite possibly a key area of the ancient Sword Pavilion, containing untold treasures and inheritances.</p><p>With the Hengsha Society’s strength alone, they couldn't open it.  Inviting a Void Refinement cultivator carried the risk of being completely exploited.  Choosing an ally required extreme caution.  The Hengsha Society was mobilizing years of accumulated connections to find suitable candidates, and Qin Sang was just one of them.</p><p>Naturally, this trip wasn't enough for them to completely trust Qin Sang's character.  They would continue to observe him in this transaction.</p><p>“You should know the locations of quite a few Sword Pavilion fragments, right? This muddy swamp alone has a Nascent Soul ferocious beast skeleton.  Other places probably hold even more treasures.  No wonder so many experts are drawn here.  Take this old man around; you won't lose out,” Qin Sang seemed to have his interest piqued by the beast skeleton.</p><p>“Yes!  This junior has been roaming the Abundant Obstacles Jade Gate for many years and has relatively good information. New Sword Pavilion fragments have been discovered over the years. Some news hasn't spread yet, and few have visited those places…”</p><p>Qu Zhen mentioned several locations, planning the most efficient route, and the two continued on their journey.</p><p>They subsequently passed through three more Sword Pavilion fragments.</p><p>These fragments varied in size, some as small as a single mountain, while others required some time to explore.  Due to their locations, cultivators were currently searching these three fragments.</p><p>People were constantly leaving and new ones arriving, searching repeatedly, practically turning the places upside down. It was said that some overlooked opportunities had indeed been stumbled upon by lucky individuals, with similar news surfacing every so often.</p><p>"The fragment ahead is very dangerous. We only dared to explore the outer edges before…"  Qu Zhen described their previous experience, leading Qin Sang to the fourth fragment.</p><p>The moment he saw the fragment, Qin Sang felt a strange sense of familiarity.</p><p>The so-called Sword Pavilion fragments, having suffered repeated damage during their ascension, were already beyond recognition. However, the remaining layout indeed gave Qin Sang a sense of déjà vu.</p><p>“It seems like… an outer area of the Purple Star Palace!”</p><p>A faint mist permeated the area, with the shadowy silhouettes of immortal mountains and palaces within. The sense of familiarity grew stronger.</p><p>Qin Sang was eighty percent certain that this was a fragment of the Purple Star Palace.</p><p>Not the previous Purple Star Palace, but the one that had revealed itself after the Immortal Formation was triggered.  Although it was only a fleeting glimpse, that image was deeply etched in Qin Sang’s memory.</p><p>The layout here seemed to correspond with a corner of the Immortal Palace. The Purple Star Palace had actually shattered as well!</p><p>Intense fluctuations emanated from the depths of the mist, indicating that experts were exploring inside, bombarding the Immortal Restrictions.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang caught a glimpse of a fleeting silhouette, flashing before a palace and disappearing.</p><p>Through the mist, the figure was indistinct, but in the instant the silhouette flickered, just like when he first saw this Sword Pavilion fragment, that sense of déjà vu surged again!</p>
