<h1>Chapter 397: Planning for a Rainy Day</h1><p>Yu Hua's position within the Ghost Yin Sect was higher than Qin Sang had imagined, and he was privy to many secrets.  He not only knew the complete secret art of the Heart-Eating Insect Gu, but also had a firm grasp on the movements of the Ghost Yin Sect remnants.</p><p>The surviving Golden Core cultivator of the Ghost Yin Sect, Daoist Jiu Pao, was Yi Tiannie's grand-nephew and the grand-disciple of the Ghost Yin Patriarch. The Ghost Yin Sect's ranks were thin. Among the third generation disciples, Daoist Jiu Pao was the only living Golden Core cultivator.  The other two Golden Cores, Yi Tiannie and his junior brother, were both ancient relics nearing the end of their lifespans.</p><p>Daoist Jiu Pao had only recently achieved Golden Core.  Barring any unforeseen circumstances, after Yi Tiannie and his brother passed away, Daoist Jiu Pao would succeed them as the sect leader of the Ghost Yin Sect, taking the reins of the demonic sect.  A bright future awaited him, yet he was implicated by Yi Tiannie.</p><p>Now, with his physical body shattered and his Golden Core severely damaged, he could only gather the remnants of the Ghost Yin Sect, hiding near Green Sun City and barely surviving. He secretly dispatched his minions, disguised as a small sect called "Demonfire," to search for spirit medicines.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the information he'd gleaned from Yu Hua, a thoughtful expression on his face.  His reluctance to remove the Heart-Eating Insect Gu stemmed from the possibility of using it as bait to hunt down the remnants of the Ghost Yin Sect, perhaps even their Golden Core cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang had never forgotten his own aptitude—five spiritual roots. For a five-spiritual root cultivator, achieving Foundation Establishment was a stroke of luck, and Golden Core was a pipe dream.  But Qin Sang was not content.</p><p>He refused to stop here!</p><p>Among False Core cultivators, less than one in ten successfully formed a Golden Core. Those who reached the False Core stage were already the elite among cultivators, each with talent far surpassing his own. This highlighted the difficulty of the immortal path.</p><p>Senior Brother Qi Yuan Shou, whose talent was among the best in Lesser Hua Mountain, had already reached the False Core stage when Qin Sang first arrived at the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.  Yet, he still hadn't made any progress toward forming his Golden Core.</p><p>Every cultivator struggled.</p><p>Even those with Heaven Spiritual Roots, who could easily cross the Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stages, would still be trapped at the Nascent Soul bottleneck. Fairy Chen Yan, a Heaven Spiritual Root cultivator and darling of the heavens, was ultimately forced to choose the demonic path of dual cultivation to break through.</p><p>Upon returning to his sect, Qin Sang hadn't heard any news of Fairy Chen Yan successfully forming her Nascent Soul. She was likely still in seclusion, and even with demonic cultivation, her hopes remained slim.  If an accident occurred during her seclusion, death was a common outcome.</p><p>Even after Nascent Soul, there was the Deity Transformation tribulation.</p><p>In the Small Cold Realm, Nascent Soul cultivators were few, but at least they existed. However, it had been ages since anyone had achieved Deity Transformation.</p><p>Unless there was absolutely no other choice, Qin Sang would not walk this treacherous, untrodden path.</p><p>However, preparations must be made in advance, lest he regret it when the time came.</p><p>The existence of the Jade Buddha ensured that Qin Sang didn't have to worry about the most terrifying hidden danger of this secret art. This was where he surpassed Wu Shang and others, and it was his greatest reliance!</p><p>Wu Shang's secret art of condensing Yin煞 and refining Yang罡 for Golden Core formation required two essential elements, both extremely difficult to obtain.</p><p>One was Dry Heaven罡 Qi.</p><p>Dry Heaven罡 Qi was bred in the highest reaches of the heavens, deep within the罡 winds, where even Nascent Soul cultivators dared not tread. To obtain it, one had to search for Dry Heaven罡 Essence, which fell from the heavens and eventually materialized in the mortal world.</p><p>Dry Heaven罡 Essence was exceedingly rare, even harder to find than Earthly Yin Meridians. Qin Sang currently only knew of the Green Sun罡 Essence within the Green Sun Demonic Sect.  But the Green Sun罡 Essence was related to the Green Sun Demonic Fire, the foundation of the Green Sun Demonic Sect, so it was clearly impossible for him to simply enter and take it.</p><p>The second requirement was a "fresh" Golden Core or Demon Core from an early Golden Core or Demon Core stage cultivator or demon beast, preferably extracted within the last ten years, and the shorter the storage time, the better.</p><p>The "Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture" also required a Golden Core or Demon Core for refining a Skyfiend, but the requirements for the core itself were not high, as long as it was complete and undamaged.</p><p>Wu Shang's "Condensing Yin煞 and Refining Yang罡" secret art was different.</p><p>The secret art required that, at the moment the core was refined and integrated into the body, elevating the Skyfiend, both Earthly Yin煞 and Dry Heaven罡 must be refined into the body simultaneously. This way, the moment Earthly Yin煞 entered the body, it would be neutralized by Dry Heaven罡, preventing the corpse core from being completely corrupted by Earthly Yin煞 and impacting the physical body and primordial spirit.</p><p>Although Qin Sang wasn't afraid of Earthly Yin煞 impacting his primordial spirit, he didn't want his physical body to be destroyed by it, turning him into a complete corpse puppet, a truly hopeless state.</p><p>Therefore, if it came to this, he had to meet Wu Shang's requirements without compromise.  This would make subsequent recovery much easier.</p><p>When Dry Heaven罡 and Earthly Yin煞 entered the body simultaneously, they inevitably clashed, creating a powerful impact on the Golden Core or Demon Core.  Golden Cores or Demon Cores stored for too long, even with restrictive seals, wouldn't lose their power, but would become "dead objects," unable to withstand the impact.</p><p>The secret art was related to Golden Core formation, and the slightest deviation could cause immeasurable consequences.  The result would be the destruction of the core and the death of the cultivator.</p><p>Golden Cores and Demon Cores could be used in medicine, for refining tools, and had countless other uses; their value was self-evident. Even if Qin Sang exhausted all his resources and wealth to buy a Golden Core or Demon Core, there might be a sliver of a chance, but the requirements of the secret art were too stringent, so he had to think of other ways.</p><p>After learning of Daoist Jiu Pao's condition, Qin Sang set his sights on him.</p><p>He wouldn't dare provoke a Golden Core cultivator in his wildest dreams.</p><p>But a severely injured Golden Core cultivator with a destroyed physical body was a different story.</p><p>Qin Sang had suffered greatly at the hands of the Ghost Yin Sect. Except for Tan Hao, Shi Hong, and a few others, he held no goodwill toward any members of the Ghost Yin Sect. He would have no qualms about killing and seizing a Golden Core.</p><p>Of course, if he were to do it, he would wait until he broke through to the False Core stage and refined Yu Hua into a Skyfiend before making plans.</p><p>Even if it weren't for killing Daoist Jiu Pao, the Skyfiend still needed to be refined.</p><p>With a Skyfiend, Qin Sang could dominate Foundation Establishment cultivators and accomplish anything much more easily.</p><p>With the Ten Yama Banners and the Skyfiend, Qin Sang would possess two means of confronting Golden Core cultivators. If he could find more methods before breaking through to the False Core stage, it might not be impossible!</p><p>He only hoped that Daoist Jiu Pao's injuries wouldn't heal too quickly.</p><p>For some unknown reason, Daoist Jiu Pao didn't dare show himself and could only send his minions to search for medicine.  Judging by Yu Hua's tone, the identities of these people were complex, including disciples of Yi Tiannie and the other Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>They were all cunning and arrogant, and only temporarily submitted to Daoist Jiu Pao due to the disparity in cultivation and the pressure from the Yuan Zhao Monastery's pursuit.  Insubordination was only to be expected.</p><p>Whether they would truly carry out Daoist Jiu Pao's orders without question was highly doubtful.</p><p>He himself could probably do something as well…</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.</p><p>If he could eliminate Daoist Jiu Pao's close associates, it might delay his recovery.  With this goal in mind, Qin Sang carefully inquired about the identities of those Ghost Yin Sect remnants from Yu Hua.</p><p>This was just a rough plan. The specific details of the operation needed meticulous planning, and he absolutely couldn't let the remnants of the Ghost Yin Sect, or Daoist Jiu Pao himself, become aware of his existence.</p>
