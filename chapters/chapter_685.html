<h1>Chapter 677: Arrival</h1><p>Having found promising leads on two treasures, Qin Sang was in high spirits. He shopped until dusk, then hurried to the city gate to meet the others.</p><p>Ning Kun and the others were already there, their cheerful expressions suggesting a successful shopping spree.  The rest of the merchant guild members, who had lagged behind, had also assembled, clearly having made significant purchases on Tian Wu Island and were ready to depart.</p><p>“Elder Zou just sent a message. A large organization is sending a ship to sea, and we’ve decided to leave immediately.  Daoist Master, have you decided whether to join us?”</p><p>Ran Luo looked at Qin Sang expectantly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “I came to hunt demons; it makes no difference which island we go to. I’ll go to Duoyan Island with you. If the merchant guild doesn't find my crafting skills valuable, I hope Daoist Friend Ran Luo will look after me.”</p><p>Ran Luo smiled. “Daoist Master, you flatter yourself. Elder Zou spoke highly of you. We would be delighted to have you join the guild.”</p><p>With their plans finalized, Qin Sang was now considered one of them, and Ran Luo and the others became noticeably friendlier.</p><p>As they spoke, more people from the Qiongyu Merchant Guild arrived by carriage. Ran Luo gave a wave and led the way to the harbor with their goods.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang learned that their ship belonged to the Nine Stars Guild, one of the top merchant guilds of the East Pole Alliance.  The ship had strong guards, and many fellow cultivators were also on board.</p><p>“Didn’t your guild send a ship?”</p><p>At the harbor, while waiting for the ship to arrive, Qin Sang asked Ran Luo.</p><p>Ran Luo shook her head. “Our guild focuses on the Inner Sea and Da Huang Island. We don't have sufficient guards on Tian Wu Island. The chance of a ship being lost at sea is extremely high. The routes are not entirely safe; not only are there frequent attacks by sea beasts along the way, but the storms in the Demon Sea are far more powerful than those in the Inner Sea. These natural and man-made disasters are all deadly.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood.  That’s why the Qiongyu Merchant Guild valued him so much; compared to transporting large demon corpses, refined artifacts are much easier to carry.</p><p>The dangers of trading in the Demon Sea were significant; reducing the number of trips while carrying more goods at once was the best way to mitigate the risk.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard many times about the terrifying storms in the Demon Sea, a natural disaster on par with beast tides. When cultivators went out hunting demons and encountered signs of a storm, they had to find shelter; otherwise, being caught in a storm meant certain death.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had a question.</p><p>“Daoist Friend Ran Luo, are the storms in the Demon Sea similar to those in the Inner Sea, caused by the overflow of power from the storm belts? Are the Demon Sea and our Inner Sea separated by a storm belt?”</p><p>Ran Luo pondered. “The storms in the Inner Sea and Demon Sea are indeed similar, but whether they are separated by a storm sea, I don’t know. There are too many rumors and conflicting accounts; there's no definitive answer to the Demon Sea's exact location relative to our Inner Sea.”</p><p>As they spoke, Qin Sang felt a huge shadow approaching. Looking up, he saw a large, sturdy ship, not luxurious but clearly very strong, sailing towards them slowly.</p><p>Once the ship was close…</p><p>Ran Luo settled their cargo, and then took Qin Sang and the others to their rooms on the ship. They went to pay their respects to Elder Zou and the ship’s owner.  Since Qin Sang was not yet a member of the Qiongyu Merchant Guild, he stayed in his room.</p><p>The ship remained in the harbor overnight and set sail before dawn the next day.</p><p>Qin Sang occupied a room alone, setting up a prohibition formation and a spirit gathering formation. He stood by the window, gazing at the sea.</p><p>This was his first time traveling by sea in this world. As the ship sailed, his view widened, and soon Tian Wu Island was left far behind and disappeared into the darkness.</p><p>The stars had not yet faded, and the starry sky and the sea met at the horizon.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there was nothing but vast waters and countless stars. The scenery broadened his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the window, his eyes slightly intoxicated, reminiscing about the past.</p><p>When he finally snapped out of it and clearly saw the scene before him, he suddenly remembered a poem:  "Drunk, unaware of the sky in the water, a boatload of clear dreams weighs down the Milky Way."</p><p>…</p><p>After the initial novelty, came the long voyage.</p><p>It wasn't entirely boring; there were frequent sea beast attacks on the ship, providing entertainment.</p><p>Qin Sang was initially excited to watch the battles from the ship's side, observing the sea beasts' habits and the strength of the Demon Sea cultivators. Later, he simply shut himself in his room, immersed in studying the several crafting techniques he had bought at great expense on Tian Wu Island.</p><p>Normally, crafting magical artifacts requires not only demonic corpses but also precious materials.</p><p>However, in the Demon Sea, there's an abundance of demonic beast materials—a virtually inexhaustible supply.  The artisans there have developed a unique approach, using various demonic corpses with only a small amount of other materials, achieving surprisingly good results.</p><p>This differs greatly from the methods of the Xu Ling Sect, a field Qin Sang has never encountered, making thorough study essential.</p><p>Fortunately, mastery of one method often leads to understanding others.  Given his skill in crafting, he quickly grasped the techniques, more than sufficient for creating top-tier artifacts.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed himself in his craft, working day and night, losing track of time.</p><p>The treasure ship sailed across the sea, stopping at various islands, with people boarding and disembarking.  </p><p>Luckily, the journey was smooth, without encountering large demonic groups or storms.</p><p>One day, having reviewed his crafting techniques numerous times, Qin Sang was experimenting with his alchemic flames in his room, striving for mastery, when a knock came at the door.  He sensed Ran Luo outside.</p><p>"Master Qingfeng, we're approaching Du Yan Island; it's time to disembark," Ran Luo whispered.</p><p>Startled, Qin Sang shook his head, pushing aside his thoughts on crafting.  Looking at his messy workshop, he smiled, waved his hand to magically clean it, and opened the door.</p><p>At the ship's rail, he saw a dark speck in the distance, gradually growing larger.</p><p>Ran Luo handed him a token, whispering, "Elder Zou has already purchased several cave dwellings on the island, all in excellent locations near spirit veins. Master, please choose a dwelling to rest for a few days before we discuss matters further."</p><p>"Very well," Qin Sang replied, accepting the token.</p><p>His recent immersion in crafting had been intense; some quiet contemplation was needed.  He was certain his skills had improved dramatically.</p><p>The combined knowledge from two different crafting traditions had yielded incredible benefits.  He was now confident he could create top-tier artifacts even without the Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>Du Yan Island was a rocky isle, its peaks jagged and barren, the exposed rock like blades, with little vegetation.</p><p>Despite its desolate appearance, the island featured neatly arranged stone houses, surrounded by a rudimentary low wall.  Remarkably, the island's spiritual energy was incredibly dense.</p>
