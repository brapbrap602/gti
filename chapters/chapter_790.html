<h1>Chapter 782: Caught in the Crossfire</h1><p>Someone suddenly appeared in the teleportation array, clearly descending from the level above.</p><p>Seeing the person's appearance, everyone was startled, then their faces turned pale.</p><p>The newcomer was a woman wearing a half-mask.  Her hair was completely white, making her look like an old woman. She wore an incredibly vibrant, ornate robe, embroidered with strange, golden patterns.</p><p>Gazing at the robe's patterns was strangely captivating, as if they held scenes of breathtaking beauty.  It was unnerving.</p><p>Qin Sang had never met this person, but he had heard of the famed Grand Witch Priestess.</p><p>Moreover, the terrifying aura emanating from the old woman was enough to confirm her identity!</p><p>The Witch Clan's Grand Witch Priestess!</p><p>Late Yuan Ying stage, one of the top experts in the Canglang Sea!</p><p>“Grand Witch Priestess!”</p><p>The man surnamed Di exclaimed in shock, his expression one of reverence.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Grand Witch Priestess didn't even glance at them. With a light tap of her foot, she effortlessly floated into the air, her robe billowing. The golden threads on the robe seemed to come alive, weaving themselves into a pair of golden wings behind her.</p><p>At that moment, the Grand Witch Priestess's posture was graceful and elegant.</p><p>Just then, the teleportation array lit up again, and a middle-aged man with a square face emerged.</p><p>This man had a resolute face and an aura no weaker than the Grand Witch Priestess. A strange light surrounded him.  His sharp eyes swept over the Grand Witch Priestess, her wings now fully unfurled.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang saw the strange light, a familiar feeling washed over him.</p><p>Within the light, a bloody surge churned, seemingly containing countless malevolent spirits, cackling and threatening to consume their minds.</p><p>“The Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Light! He is the Demon Lord!”</p><p>Qin Sang was horrified. He never expected to encounter both the Demon Lord and the Grand Witch Priestess simultaneously, and right as they were about to step into the teleportation array.</p><p>“Leave what you have stolen!”</p><p>The Demon Lord’s face was grim, his gaze fixed on the Grand Witch Priestess as he suddenly attacked.</p><p>The Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Light shot out like a radiant beam, its power unmatched, surging like a tidal wave.</p><p>Demonic energy erupted from the light, the ghostly figures contorting in terrifying expressions, emitting soul-chilling cries.</p><p>For a moment, it felt as if ten thousand ghosts were wailing in the void, transforming the space into a horrifying netherworld.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The radiant light descended, directly targeting the Grand Witch Priestess.</p><p>“The treasures within the Seven Killing Hall belong to no one.  Friend Daoist, you live up to your name, Demon Lord; truly domineering. Seizing what you don’t even know.”</p><p>A mocking smile played on the Grand Witch Priestess’ lips, her laughter like silver bells ringing out.  Her wings beat furiously, the surrounding area blazing with golden light, transforming into a golden ocean.</p><p>As the light was about to collide with the Grand Witch Priestess,</p><p>Qin Sang's face showed terror, yelling, “Not good!”</p><p>He suddenly glowed with red and white light, simultaneously activating the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman and the Sword Qi Thunder Sound, his figure 'whooshing' dozens of meters away as he fled without looking back.</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed the terrifying power of Yuan Ying Masters clashing in Xiao Han Domain.</p><p>And these were beings far more powerful than anything he'd seen in Xiao Han Domain, late Yuan Ying stage cultivators.</p><p>Even a single ripple from their battle would leave them no chance of survival; they would be utterly defenseless.  Staying meant certain death.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess and the Demon Lord wouldn't care about the lives of insignificant ants during their fight.</p><p>The others reacted no slower than Qin Sang.</p><p>The woman surnamed Yin summoned a flying shuttle, turning into a silver streak, only slightly slower than Qin Sang, but far less swift.</p><p>The man surnamed Di, who had been in awe, as if before a deity, was jolted back to reality by this scene, breaking out in a cold sweat.</p><p>He slapped his dantian, and an eight-winged insect shadow suddenly appeared, carrying him to escape in another direction.</p><p>The old woman hastily produced a talisman, pain evident in her eyes, gritting her teeth as she activated it, yet still slower than Qin Sang.</p><p>As they desperately fled,</p><p>The Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Light plunged into the golden light, like a meteor falling into the sea.</p><p>There were no waves, no loud crash, only silence in the void, time seeming to freeze.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The golden ocean collapsed.</p><p>The Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Light shattered piece by piece, the demonic energy dissipating, the ghosts emitting silent screams as their bodies disintegrated.</p><p>Immediately, a terrifying wave erupted from the center of the collision, spreading with astonishing speed.</p><p>The golden light dispersed, the Grand Witch Priestess trembled slightly, but without a wound, her colorful robe unharmed. Only her wings were dulled, but the Grand Witch Priestess's true energy surged, restoring the wings to their brilliance. With a gentle flap, she carried herself rapidly away.</p><p>The Demon Lord coldly snorted.  Magical energy surged from his palm, transforming into a black long blade. He slashed out a wave of energy, creating a passage, then his figure flashed, pursuing the fleeing figures.</p><p>Both disappeared.</p><p>From beginning to end, they hadn't even glanced at those nearby.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were suffering greatly.</p><p>As expected, the aftershocks of the battle erupted. Fragments of golden light mixed with demonic energy assaulted them with terrifying speed.</p><p>Of the five, the Wu cultivator who had been manipulating the small shield was a beat too slow and was instantly swallowed by the aftermath, perishing without a single cry.  Even his treasure, the quite sturdy shield, vanished without a trace.</p><p>The person who had just been conversing with them was caught in the crossfire of the two powerful cultivators, dying silently.</p><p>Everyone was petrified.</p><p>Qin Sang was flung far away, a chill still clinging to his spine.  He turned his head and saw the aftershock still spreading, its power significantly reduced from its initial intensity, but its speed remained alarming.  He couldn't possibly escape its range.</p><p>He then saw the elderly woman behind him, almost overtaken by the shockwave, staring at him in terror, her eyes pleading for help. The spiritual energy emanating from her talismans was fading rapidly, clearly unsustainable for much longer.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.  He stopped, turned back towards the old woman, and with a flash of his wrist, summoned his double-headed  beast.</p><p>The old woman's face lit up with surprise and gratitude.</p><p>"We defend against the shockwave together!"</p><p>Qin Sang said in a low voice, summoning the Ten Directions Yama Banner.  He had retrieved the demonic banner the moment things turned precarious.  It was for his own survival; the aftershock was too fast to evade. It was better to face it calmly—more people meant more strength, more hope.  Besides, the old woman was a strong cultivator, and she possessed a powerful defensive treasure.</p><p>The double-headed beast bristled, its fur standing on end. It glared resentfully at Qin Sang, lowered its head slightly, and its vertical pupils shot out green light, forming a swirling vortex that rapidly compressed into a shield-like shape.</p><p>The old woman landed beside them, catching her breath.  Understanding Qin Sang's intention, she hastily activated her bronze mirror. There was no time to conserve treasures; she had to use it to block the oncoming energy.</p><p>In an instant, a triple barrier formed—the mirror, the demonic flames, and the wind shield.</p><p>The aftershock arrived.</p><p>The figures of the two and the beast were engulfed.</p>
