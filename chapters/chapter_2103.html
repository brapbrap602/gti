<h1>Chapter 2094: The Turmoil in the Demon Sea</h1><p>Northern Demon Sea.</p><p>Massive creatures silently rose from the seabed, like giant sea beasts, bobbing on the surface.</p><p>A colossal Jiao dragon led the way, its scales shimmering gold, its horns majestic.  Jiao Dragon King and other demons stood between its horns.</p><p>The night was deep, the moon hidden behind thick clouds.</p><p>Under the cover of darkness, the Jiao Dragon King led his army towards the Demon Sea.</p><p>Days later, at dawn, the army approached the Demon Sea.</p><p>After the Changyou Clan occupied the Demon Sea and Canglang Sea, they didn't relocate many people here, using it as a springboard to contend for the Qingling energy and to deter the eastern Storm Realm.  Their main forces were concentrated in areas rich in spiritual energy, with the relocated clansmen residing around the encampments.</p><p>The Changyou Clan had turned the Demon Sea and Canglang Sea into a series of well-guarded camps.  They remained wary of the Storm Realm, maintaining strict security with powerful warriors stationed throughout, making reconnaissance difficult.</p><p>However, the demon tribes and the Changyou Clan had clashed several times in the Polluted Lands, constantly sending spies to monitor the camps.  They had managed to discern certain patterns, and Jiao Dragon King had a general understanding of the Changyou Clan's troop deployments.</p><p>The Changyou Clan's troop movement to the North Sea was orchestrated by Jiao Dragon King himself. As a result, the defenses here were significantly weakened.</p><p>Among the many camps, two were of paramount importance, located in the areas with the most concentrated spiritual energy in the Canglang and Demon Seas – the original Jiao Dragon ancestral lands and the former human city of Tianxing.</p><p>Of course, both locations were now unrecognizable.</p><p>Jiao Dragon King's plan was to strike at the heart of the Changyou forces before they could react, reclaiming his ancestral lands.</p><p>The islands were arranged in a circle, surrounded by tightly packed guards.</p><p>Jiao Dragon King tried his best to conceal the army's movements and personally eliminated sentries, but the sheer scale of the demon army’s advance eventually made stealth impossible.</p><p>Jiao Dragon Ancestral Lands.</p><p>The east was beginning to lighten, a faint crescent moon still visible in the sky, creating a peaceful scene.</p><p>Suddenly, the alarm bells rang out, shattering the tranquility of the camp.</p><p>These were the warning bells, sounded only in the event of a major enemy attack. The Changyou Clan's only enemies were the beasts of the Polluted Lands and the Storm Realm. The Storm Realm, however, had been recuperating and gathering strength, never having launched an attack before.</p><p>In a luxurious palace, an elderly Changyou Clan member abruptly opened his eyes.  Instantly, a breaking sound echoed outside the hall as the protective barrier was breached.</p><p>"Enter!"</p><p>The elder growled.</p><p>A man in black armor pushed open the palace doors and hurried into the hall, his expression grave.</p><p>"What's happening outside?" the elder asked.</p><p>"Reporting to Third Elder!"</p><p>The man in black armor bowed. "Jiulan Camp has sounded the alarm.  A foreign army has suddenly attacked. Jiulan Camp is surrounded, and enemy experts are rushing towards us! We failed to detect this enemy force beforehand. I am at fault and accept any punishment, Third Elder!"</p><p>His demeanor was relatively calm, but anxiety flickered in his eyes.  To plan the North Sea attack, the General had ordered the removal of most of the clan's people, leaving them severely undermanned.  Furthermore, to pressure the Central Plains, they had also dispatched troops to patrol near the eastern Storm Sea.</p><p>"A foreign army?"</p><p>The Third Elder's eyes flashed, but he didn't reprimand the man in black armor.  "Are they humans or demons?"</p><p>The black-armored man was taken aback, unsure of the Elder's intention, replying, "Around Jiulan Camp, we only see a massive wave of beasts, no sign of humans."</p><p>"It's the demons, just as the Clan Chief predicted!"</p><p>The Third Elder murmured, pondering for a moment before issuing a stern order, "Pass on my command: all camps are not to hold their ground. Everyone is to evacuate immediately, including us!"</p><p>The black-armored man exclaimed, "Where do we retreat to?"</p><p>"To Xi Yue Sea! If those demons pursue, continue retreating and await the Clan Chief's orders!" the Third Elder stated resolutely.</p><p>Xi Yue Sea was the Changyou Clan's name for the Canglang Sea, while the corresponding Demon Sea was known as Dong Yue Sea. The two seas were not far apart, yet a clear boundary separated them, like two halves of a crescent moon.</p><p>"Third Elder, why?"</p><p>The black-armored man was utterly astonished, incredulous that the Third Elder wasn't putting up any resistance and planned to abandon Xi Yue Sea directly.</p><p>Their defenses were weak, but they weren't defenseless.  If they could hold out until reinforcements arrived, there was still a chance.</p><p>These foreign tribes were far stronger now. If they surrendered their territory, reclaiming it would be incredibly difficult, and they would be severely punished.</p><p>Hearing this, the black-armored man's doubts vanished.  He replied "Yes," and left the hall.</p><p>The Third Elder sat behind his desk, deep in thought.</p><p>In truth, he didn't understand the Clan Chief's intentions, why he would willingly cede the land to the enemy.  Moreover, years ago, preparations for a retreat had begun; weaker clan members had been gradually sent back to Sheng Mu Yuan, leaving only the main army to guard the camps.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, he would have questioned the Clan Chief, weighed the pros and cons, and if necessary, defied orders, summoning the other clan elders for discussion.</p><p>As the clan leader broke through to the second level of the Void Realm, his prestige became unmatched.  Even if the land was temporarily lost, it wouldn't matter; regaining it would be easy once he returned. The priority was preserving strength and avoiding unnecessary casualties.</p><p>Soon, the bell's toll changed to the rhythm of war drums, and chaos erupted outside.</p><p>After a short meditation, the Third Elder rose, adjusted his robes, and left the hall.</p><p>Dark clouds filled the sky, and numerous figures could be seen. The elite of the Jiao Long clan, present in the ancestral lands, were poised to move.  Following the Third Elder's order, they began an orderly retreat, taking what they could.</p><p>Meanwhile, the demon army advanced relentlessly.</p><p>Their movements having been discovered, they made no attempt to hide, charging towards the Jiao Long ancestral lands at top speed. They pressed forward, regardless of Changyou encampments, encountering surprisingly little resistance.  The enemy, clearly forewarned, had fled, leaving behind empty camps.</p><p>The demon army's advance was unimpeded, reaching the ancestral lands almost without resistance.  Their morale soared, exceeding even their own expectations.</p><p>"We're finally home!"</p><p>Jiao Long Wang looked ahead, a wistful expression on his face.  This was the ancestral land of the Jiao Long, his home. He recalled the shame and humiliation of being driven out by the Changyou clan centuries ago.</p><p>Much had changed, many things were unfamiliar, yet a deep sense of familiarity stirred within him, prompting a surge of emotion even in his stoic heart.</p><p>The demon army approached with overwhelming force, their demonic aura and fierce winds creating colossal waves as they swept toward the ancestral lands.</p><p>From afar, several demon kings, using their enhanced vision, finally spotted the Changyou camp.</p><p>The camp was shrouded in a black mist, like an impenetrable curtain, hiding its interior in a deathly silence. Not a single soldier was visible outside the barrier.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang nodded, agreeing. He suppressed his aura and signaled the dragon beneath him to halt.</p><p>After a brief discussion amongst Jin Chan Wang, Huang Wang, and the other demon kings, they spread through the army.  Then, amidst the crashing waves, terrifying roars echoed.</p><p>The army surged past Jiao Long Wang, a tidal wave crashing towards the black curtain.</p><p>The Phoenix clan led the aerial assault—innumerable birds, from herons to eagles and sparrows—a cloud of wings blotting out the sky.</p><p>Beneath the waves, Jiao Long led the aquatic forces—a legion of aquatic creatures, large whales and sharks seamlessly blending with the tide.</p><p>Between the water and sky, the Jin Chan clan led a throng of land creatures, marching across the waves in impressive order.</p><p>Heaven and earth were filled with the vast army, magical barriers and precious light flashing amidst the beasts.</p><p>'Croak!'</p><p>Just as the beast tide was about to strike the black curtain, a deafening toad croak resonated, a rhythmic sound accompanying a burst of golden light at the front of the army.  The demons appeared to be clad in golden armor.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The earth trembled as the beast tide crashed into the curtain.</p><p>From Jiao Long Wang's position, the curtain was completely obscured, only the countless beasts visible.  They were packed together, and if they could not break through, the rear would crush the front, leading to chaos.</p><p>However, this didn't happen. The leading wave parted, allowing a continuous onslaught against the curtain—a smooth, steady pressure like a river hitting a rock.</p><p>At that moment, Jiao Long Wang sensed a shift. Before the initial impact was even complete, the curtain wavered. Then, a deafening sound shattered the air. The curtain, to the astonishment of everyone, including Jiao Long Wang, cracked.</p><p>Without much effort, the ancestral lands were reclaimed. But the demon army didn't stop. Jiao Long Wang, Jin Chan Wang, and Huang Wang split their forces into three, sweeping across the land.  The enemy offered little resistance, fleeing at the army's approach.</p><p>Soon, the army had cleansed the entire Demon Sea, reclaiming all the ancestral lands. The Changyou clan was almost completely driven out.</p><p>The kings assembled. Jiao Long Wang decided to press on, driving the Changyou from the entire Canglang Sea.</p><p>The victory was glorious, but he was unsatisfied. The Changyou had avoided battle and suffered minimal losses; it felt like punching cotton, which Jiao Long Wang found unacceptable.</p><p>The Canglang Sea is too close to the Demon Sea.  If we don't seize this opportunity to decisively defeat the elite Changyou forces, once they regroup, they will counterattack, and we will never know peace.</p><p>Saint Mu Plain.</p><p>By the Sacred Lake.</p><p>The Changyou clan chief, Min Zhuo, had somehow already left seclusion and was meeting Zhai Zhen in a stone pavilion atop a mountain by the lake.</p><p>"Brother Zhai has come personally.  What wisdom do you bring?" Min Zhuo asked, his eyes guarded.</p><p>Zhai Zhen gazed towards the horizon. "Brother Min, how are your battles with those otherworldly beings progressing?"</p><p>"Following your instructions, Brother Zhai, I deployed the army to conquer the North Sea.  That powerful demon did not appear. However, recently, the demons launched an offensive to reclaim their ancestral lands; it must have been that powerful being's doing," Min Zhuo answered truthfully.</p><p>"Brother Min, you must have ordered your people to retreat, unwilling to offend that powerful demon, correct?" Zhai Zhen said.</p><p>"Correct!"</p><p>Min Zhuo's brow furrowed; a foreboding feeling washed over him.</p><p>"Unfortunately, that is not what that powerful being wants," Zhai Zhen shook his head slightly.  "Next, Brother Min should emerge from seclusion, personally travel east, and slaughter them until rivers of blood flow, giving the demons a lesson they will never forget!"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Min Zhuo was startled and abruptly stood. "Brother Zhai, you want me to slaughter those demon cultivators?"</p><p>With his Void Realm Second Stage cultivation, bullying the weak, that powerful demon would certainly not stand idly by; it could even lead to a deadly feud.</p><p>"Not me, but that powerful being's wishes," Zhai Zhen pointed to the sky. "Brother Min, you needn't worry too much. This is precisely to lure him out. I and other fellow cultivators will be there to support you!"</p><p>Min Zhuo's expression shifted between gloom and uncertainty. He understood his role—a mere test stone!</p><p>But he dared not disobey. To offend the powerful demon meant offending the one who gave him the Jade Yang Divine Milk.</p><p>Quickly assessing the situation, he calmly said, "With Brother Zhai's support, I naturally have no fear, but my clan's elite forces are currently in the North Sea. What if the other side retaliates or uses them as hostages...?"</p><p>Zhai Zhen nodded. "Brother Min thinks carefully.  In that case, let a fellow cultivator go to protect them. Brother Min should rest assured."</p><p>With that, he flicked his finger, sending out a spell.  In the distant mountains, subtle fluctuations immediately appeared, echoing the gesture. (End)</p>
