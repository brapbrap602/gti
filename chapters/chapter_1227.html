<h1>Chapter 1219: News of the Ancestral Sacred Flame</h1><p>Qin Sang listened patiently as Mei Gu finished speaking.</p><p>The disciple of the Azure Sun Demon Sect's sect master was extremely cautious. Mei Gu never directly revealed her intentions, only occasionally mentioning trivial matters during their exchanges on cultivation experiences.</p><p>Combined with information gathered from other sources, a vague outline began to take shape.</p><p>What caught Qin Sang's attention the most was that the Azure Sun Demon Sect's sect master would return to the sect periodically, often staying at the Divine Peak.</p><p>During his last return, he had traveled alongside Bing Han, the sect master of the Ethereal Spirit Sect!</p><p>There were other details as well.</p><p>For instance, the disciple's cultivation level was similar to Mei Gu's, but she was not permitted to ascend to the peak of the Divine Peak to retrieve the Azure Sun Jade for cultivation. Only senior disciples with higher cultivation could do so.</p><p>...</p><p>Putting it all together, it was clear that the Azure Sun Demon Sect had not yet fully suppressed the Ancestral Sacred Flame!</p><p>However, whether the sect master had already found a solution remained uncertain.</p><p>Bing Han, as the sect master of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, was also highly skilled in flame manipulation. If the Azure Sun Demon Sect's sect master had actively sought her help to resolve this issue, it could also be an opportunity for Qin Sang!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he pondered for a long while.</p><p>After giving Mei Gu some guidance, Qin Sang left Stone Song Mountain and instructed Fat Chicken to inquire about the progress of finding an overseas base in the Thousand Bamboo Sea. He also arranged for White Cat and the others to take turns training at the Triple Pass.</p><p>Meanwhile, he continued to disguise himself as an elder of the Yuan Mirage Sect and returned there.</p><p>Bai's cave was tightly shut, as he had been in seclusion all this time.</p><p>Qin Sang triggered the restrictions at the entrance of the cave and waited for two full days before Bai finally emerged.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, Bai seemed somewhat dispirited.</p><p>"Brother Bai, were you attempting a forced breakthrough?"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed something was off and asked with a frown.</p><p>Bai let out a bitter laugh, "After years of seclusion with no progress, I grew impatient. I nearly triggered a backlash from the Soul Pearl, which could have led to disaster. Fortunately, I regained my senses at the last moment and only suffered some injuries. I've mostly recovered now."</p><p>"After enduring millennia of trials, why rush now?"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected such a thing to happen to Bai.</p><p>He had thought that Bai, having been trapped by demonic flames and enduring endless desolation and despair, would have the patience to withstand anything. Yet, even he had grown impatient.</p><p>Bai sighed in shame and shook his head without speaking.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang said no more, confident that Bai, with his wisdom, would not make the same mistake twice.</p><p>He took out the bones inscribed with bone curses. "Not long ago, I followed the clues left by Tan Hao and found the headquarters of the Heavenly Corpse Sect. Although I didn't find any典籍, I did discover these bones. Their origins are extraordinary—they might belong to the person who guided the Heavenly Corpse Sect's founder in establishing the sect..."</p><p>"Brother Qin, you even found the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters? Did you see Tan Hao?"</p><p>Bai was somewhat surprised.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "I only found a place where Tan Hao had briefly stayed—a branch of the Heavenly Corpse Sect. After rescuing that mysterious person, he disappeared, and the trail went cold. I'll have some trusted friends help search for him later. I suspect that the mysterious person might be from the same era as you, Brother Bai..."</p><p>Bai pondered thoughtfully, "The Heavenly Corpse Talisman is indeed troublesome. It doesn't seem like a technique created by a Nascent Soul cultivator. From what you've said, the Abyssal Ruins seem like a prison for high-level cultivators. For someone to survive there until now, their origins must be extraordinary, and their former cultivation might even surpass mine. It's a pity I didn't go with you; otherwise, I might have remembered something."</p><p>The passage had already been exposed, making it difficult to infiltrate the Abyssal Ruins again.</p><p>As Bai spoke, he picked up the bones and began examining them. At first glance, he was captivated. Seeing his reaction, Qin Sang felt a surge of joy—it hadn't been a wasted trip after all.</p><p>"So that's how it is! So that's how it is!"</p><p>After reading all the bone curses, Bai muttered to himself, his expression filled with excitement, as if he had gained significant insights.</p><p>"Thank you, Brother Qin. The Heavenly Corpse Sect's secret techniques must originate from these bone curses. Once I fully comprehend them, I can refine the Soul Pearl and advance to the Corpse King stage!"</p><p>Bai's face was alight with excitement, and he immediately prepared to return to seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. Helping Bai achieve a breakthrough was worth it. As for whether he could use the bone curses to find a way to undo the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, that would have to wait until Bai emerged from seclusion.</p><p>Just as Bai was about to enter, he suddenly remembered something, "By the way, has there been any sign of the Purple Micro Palace's emergence?"</p><p>He had heard Qin Sang mention that before the Purple Micro Palace appeared, there would be a spiritual tide. By his calculations, it should be about time.</p><p>Qin Sang knew Bai had always been very interested in the Purple Micro Palace. Last time, due to time constraints and his own insufficient strength, he hadn't been able to explore it thoroughly.</p><p>"The spiritual tide has already appeared. This time, the interval will definitely be within a hundred years!"</p><p>"Just as I expected."</p><p>Bai nodded lightly, then suddenly changed his tone, asking Qin Sang, "You control the passage between the two realms. When do you plan to return to the Canglang Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "From the looks of it, the Purple Micro Palace's emergence will become more frequent. There's no need to rush back to the Canglang Sea. The chances of finding the second fragment of the Slaughter Sword in the Canglang Sea are slim, and my current strength isn't enough to freely search the Demon Sea. I have the Moonview Rhinoceros Horn, so I plan to wait until I hit a bottleneck in my cultivation before traveling to the other three realms to broaden my horizons."</p><p>"Aside from the Slaughter Sword fragment, what attracts you most about the Purple Micro Palace is the Southern Brightness Flame, right? Have you decided what treasure to refine to subdue the spiritual fire?"</p><p>Bai seemed very interested in Qin Sang's plans.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "I only have some vague ideas. Recently, I've been too busy with trivial matters to think it through properly. If it comes to it, I can always subdue it after entering the palace."</p><p>Bai disagreed with Qin Sang's approach, "The Purple Micro Palace is clearly undergoing significant changes, and it's uncertain whether they are for better or worse. This has caused unrest within the palace. If the ancient restrictions inside change and others discover the Southern Brightness Flame, they will surely covet such a top-tier spiritual fire and compete with you for it. In my opinion, the sooner you subdue it, the better."</p><p>"Brother Bai makes a valid point. I'll consider it carefully."</p><p>Qin Sang agreed with Bai's reasoning. The instability in the Cold Domain and the ambitious Sin Abyss made the future unpredictable. Securing the treasure early would bring peace of mind.</p><p>Speaking of refining treasures, Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he took out the piece of white copper.</p><p>"Brother Bai, do you recognize this?"</p><p>Bai examined it for a while before shaking his head, "I can't recall what it is, but this white copper can repel divine sense, making it impossible to probe its interior. It's definitely no ordinary object."</p><p>When divine sense touched the white copper, it felt like a burning sting, which was why Qin Sang had been unable to discern its properties.</p><p>Now that Bai wasn't in a hurry to return to seclusion, he asked Qin Sang about the war and the situation with the Sin Abyss. There was no need to hide anything, so Qin Sang shared everything he knew.</p><p>After searching through the Yuan Mirage Sect's典籍 without finding any records related to the white copper, Qin Sang left the sect that night and returned to Li Yufu's cave.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu had lived up to expectations and successfully built his foundation, now consolidating his cultivation.</p><p>After giving Bai Hanqiu some guidance, Qin Sang took Li Yufu and met up with Fat Chicken and the other demons before heading back to the Triple Pass.</p><p>He had received word from his senior sister that the Two Realms Alliance had sent people to investigate the Boundless Valley. Once they returned, a meeting of all Nascent Soul cultivators would be convened to discuss the matter.</p>
