<h1>Chapter 1666: The Twin Steles</h1><p>With each completed hand seal, they unleashed a treasure—precious spiritual materials, each invaluable and exceedingly rare. Only the three major merchant alliances possessed the resources to amass such a collection.</p><p>The hand seals and treasures merged, scattering like celestial flowers, descending around the steles.</p><p>Finally, an exceptionally complex spirit array gradually formed, encircling the steles.</p><p>The shadowy figures behind them strode into the array.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The shadowy figures roared, harnessing the power of the array, and unleashed powerful blows against the steles.</p><p>The force of their punches was earth-shattering, accompanied by the sound of thunderous drums.</p><p>Howling winds swept through the mountain pass, and demonic energy surged like a tsunami.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the seemingly ordinary steles, despite such an assault, remained unmoved, standing firm.</p><p>A faint, ethereal light glided across their surfaces—the glow of a mysterious seal, effortlessly deflecting the force of the blows.</p><p>The steles were the seal itself.</p><p>Three peak-level Yuan Ying mid-stage masters from the merchant alliances, along with a meticulously prepared array, still couldn't shake the seal!</p><p>However, this was only the beginning.</p><p>The shadowy figures danced wildly.</p><p>Countless fist shadows rained down on the steles.</p><p>From deep within the steles, the Demon Lord's voice echoed, seemingly reciting an obscure and incomprehensible incantation.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>After the deafening roar, all the fist shadows abruptly dissipated.</p><p>At this moment, the seal remained intact, but a strange power had formed on the stele's surface, gathering the array's energy, gradually forming an unprecedented black talisman.</p><p>The talisman clung to the stele, seemingly merging with the seal.</p><p>“Demonic Soul Talisman! Activate!”</p><p>The Demon Lord roared, launching a frenzied assault on the seal, his grotesque face contorted in rage.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The black talisman exploded, shattering completely into millions of demonic needles. Some were annihilated by the seal's counterattack, while others pierced into the seal!</p><p>The power of the Demonic Soul Talisman clashed with the seal.</p><p>An ethereal light flickered on the steles, the situation uncertain.</p><p>Elsewhere, a simultaneous transformation was taking place!</p><p>Within the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>In hidden locations, without warning, strange fluctuations erupted.</p><p>Some were in secret realms, others deep within forbidden lands—all places untouched by human presence.</p><p>Cliffs collapsed, the earth cracked open.</p><p>The fluctuations grew more violent, accompanied by the faint rumble of thunder. At the heart of the fluctuations, blinding golden light shone, and identical altars appeared.</p><p>Each altar was about a zhang square on top.</p><p>At each corner of the altar hung an iron chain, embedded in the ground, engraved with incredibly profound runes.</p><p>The restrictions were triggered, the chains taut, the runes blazing, emitting a silvery-white light.</p><p>In an instant, the rust vanished, silver serpents writhing on the chains as they transformed into thunder chains, radiating a supremely yang and powerful aura.</p><p>Lightning flashed, thunder roared.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Altar after altar appeared, their distribution following a pattern that harmonized with the constellations.</p><p>Cultivators exploring the outer hall sensed the anomaly, abandoning their tasks to ascend to higher ground, gazing around with uncertain expressions.</p><p>Then, the three main altars appeared.</p><p>One was in the trial grounds, the other two deeply hidden within the inner hall's forbidden areas, all discovered and manipulated by the three alliance masters.</p><p>The three main altars emerged simultaneously, forming the core of the seal, connected to the other auxiliary altars, creating a more grand scale and strengthening the seal's power.</p><p>At that moment, the entire sealing array was activated.</p><p>Starting from the deepest point, the steles gradually transformed into a silvery-white color, countless thin bolts of lightning surging from within, striking fiercely at the Demon Lord beneath the seal.</p><p>The Demon Lord let out a piercing shriek, enduring terrible agony, yet continued to assault the seal.</p><p>At that moment, a strange fluctuation reversed its course from the seal, spreading towards the outer altars.</p><p>The Demonic Soul Talismans on the altars, previously dormant, were drawn by the fluctuation. Without any incantation, their power was activated.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Extremely pure demonic energy transformed into a grotesque face, cackling maniacally as it lunged at the thunder chains.</p><p>The thunder chains were enveloped by demonic energy, their power greatly diminished, and the seal's strength weakened significantly, the altars' golden light dimming, nearly extinguishing.</p><p>…</p><p>Simultaneously.</p><p>Within the ancient temple in the cliff.</p><p>Three descendants of the Four Saints Palace stood solemnly.</p><p>The place seemed to be a shrine; before them was an altar with only three spirit tablets.  However, if outsiders were to see the names on the tablets, they would be shocked—they were the names of three of the Four Saints!</p><p>Humanity named Four Saints Mountain on Tianxing Island to commemorate four sages, yet their spirit tablets were here.</p><p>“…These are the ancestral precepts left by our ancestors. You must remember them!”</p><p>The elder offered incense, worshipping his ancestors while instructing his descendants, passing down the ancestral teachings.</p><p>“We will keep them in our hearts.”</p><p>The young initiates bowed deeply before their ancestors, their movements precise and unwavering.  Suddenly, a dull bell tolled from the ancient temple.  An old man, a black bell swaying violently at his waist, looked down, his face instantly paling. He dashed out of the temple.</p><p>The young initiates exchanged bewildered glances, unsure of what had transpired.</p><p>The old man flew from the cliff face, his expression urgent. His gaze swept rapidly across the landscape before he sped towards the top of Yitian Peak, reaching the cliff's edge and spotting a valley in the distance.</p><p>Demonic energy raged within the valley. The barrier, erected by the three alliance leaders, was failing to contain the phenomenon.</p><p>"Ancient Demon unleashed!"</p><p>Seeing this, the old man was shocked. He started towards the valley, but then remembered something and swiftly returned to the temple.</p><p>"Grandmaster…"</p><p>The young initiates were distraught.</p><p>"Stay here, don't wander!"</p><p>The old man instructed hastily, hurrying to the altar.</p><p>"Ancestors, forgive me!"</p><p>He moved the altar, revealing a smaller, knee-high stele beneath.  Unlike the one in the valley, this one was jade-green and luminous, a jade stele!</p><p>The old man sat cross-legged before it, executing intricate hand seals.  Runes flickered around the stele, ancient prohibitions manifesting.</p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>The old man attempted to remove the stele using a secret technique.  A loud sound echoed as the stele, impossibly heavy, lifted a few inches before crashing back down.</p><p>His face flushed, the old man poured his Qi into another technique, finally lifting the stele.  Under the worried gaze of his disciples, he immediately flew from the temple.</p><p>Meanwhile, an old woman, also a descendant of the Four Saints, checked the celestial barrier at the entrance to the Seven Kills Hall before entering the secluded valley.  The bell at her waist vibrated.</p><p>A fierce light flashed in her eyes, and her speed increased dramatically.</p><p>…</p><p>Atop Yitian Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ning Wu Hui were startled awake from their meditation.  Exchanging a glance, they rose, standing before the temple doors, looking down.</p><p>Near the edge of their vision, in a valley amidst a stone forest, black mist surged, displaying unusual fluctuations.</p><p>"Could it be Elder Qingzhu has arrived?"</p><p>Qin Sang watched the valley intently, confined within the temple, unaware of the unfolding events.</p><p>"Wait here, I'll investigate nearby."</p><p>After observing for a moment without discerning anything, Ning Wu Hui vanished.</p><p>"Be careful, friend!"</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sudden unease. This black mist was familiar, strongly resembling true demonic Qi.</p>
