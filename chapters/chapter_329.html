<h1>Chapter 322 The Hulking Man</h1><p>Qin Sang donned a mask. Carved roughly from what looked like aged bark, its crude craftsmanship was almost unbearable to behold. Yet, it was a mid-grade magical artifact, possessing the sole ability to shield him from prying eyes and divine senses. Any attempt to scrutinize him would be instantly detected.</p><p>Glancing at the crowd gathered before the tower, Qin Sang observed that most were similarly attired. Some wore cloaks and masks, while others concealed themselves completely beneath heavy robes.</p><p>Even those who flaunted their faces openly couldn't be entirely trusted. In the world of cultivation, tools and spells for shape-shifting and disguise were commonplace. After all, the Yin Mountain Garrison only guaranteed absolute safety within the confines of Stone Island.</p><p>Finding an opening, Qin Sang lowered his head slightly and approached the entrance.</p><p>Several Qi Refinement stage cultivators stood guard. Despite their relatively low cultivation level, none of the attendees dared to slight them.  Their robes, embroidered with a miniature replica of the Yin Mountain Garrison fortress, symbolized their status as disciples of the Garrison's commander.</p><p>They meticulously inspected each entrant's token, denying access to those without.</p><p>Qin Sang's token, a gift from Steward Pu, hadn't prompted him to inquire about its acquisition. He assumed that for Foundation Establishment cultivators, obtaining one wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>After presenting his token and receiving clearance, Qin Sang was about to step inside when he caught sight of a figure beside him.  He paused, a look of surprise beneath his mask.</p><p>"Could you take a look, young friend? Is this token genuine?"</p><p>A towering cultivator, a full head taller than Qin Sang, held up his token and addressed the guard with a hint of urgency.  The token appeared like a toy in his massive hand.</p><p>A hooded artifact partially obscured the man's face, a faint black mist swirling around his head. Coupled with his imposing stature, he blocked the light from the tower's embedded night pearls, casting Qin Sang into his shadow.</p><p>His voice indicated he was male.  Surely no woman possessed such a physique?</p><p>Qin Sang accepted his own token back, discreetly observing the hulking man from the corner of his eye. The man hadn't concealed his aura, revealing an early Foundation Establishment cultivation level – though this could be a deliberate deception.</p><p>Such a burly, bear-like physique was rare among cultivators.  He was fortunate his robe seemed adjustable; otherwise, it would surely burst.</p><p>For some reason, the sight of this man stirred a vague sense of familiarity in Qin Sang, puzzling him.</p><p>Having encountered numerous Foundation Establishment cultivators, Qin Sang couldn't recall ever meeting this one. The source of this strange familiarity eluded him.</p><p>"Senior, your token is authentic. Please enter!" the guard confirmed, gesturing respectfully.</p><p>The large man seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, offering profuse thanks before hurrying inside.</p><p>Qin Sang followed at a more leisurely pace, dismissing the nagging feeling of recognition. Perhaps the man's physique was an illusion, or maybe he was simply a stranger who happened to resemble someone Qin Sang had met before.</p><p>In such a place, it was best to avoid unwanted attention.  Any uninvited interaction might be misconstrued as hostile.</p><p>Upon entering the hall, Qin Sang was met not by a corridor but by a curtain of darkness.  He probed with his divine sense, finding only emptiness. Anyone who entered the darkness seemed to vanish completely.</p><p>Undeterred, Qin Sang stepped forward.  After a few paces, the scene shifted, and he found himself seated in a large chamber. The hall was square, but the walls, like the entrance, were shrouded in darkness.</p><p>A raised platform stood at the front, unoccupied save for ten young women in Yin Mountain Garrison attire, standing respectfully on either side.</p><p>As Qin Sang materialized, a girl's voice reached his ear through a mental transmission, "Senior, please be seated. The auction will begin shortly. Allow me to explain the rules..."</p><p>Already familiar with the procedures, Qin Sang didn't interrupt. He listened to the girl's melodious voice while surveying his surroundings.</p><p>The hall was already fairly occupied, yet an unusual silence prevailed. Everyone patiently awaited the commencement of the auction.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly spotted the hulking man in a corner.  Motionless, hands clasped into fists, knuckles white, he seemed strangely restless.</p><p>The fleeting sense of familiarity, so abrupt and vague, remained unresolved. Qin Sang still couldn't pinpoint its origin and attributed it to a momentary lapse.</p><p>Frowning, Qin Sang glanced away.</p><p>Just then, a black flash streaked past, and another cultivator materialized beside Qin Sang.  Startled by the sudden proximity, the newcomer immediately adopted a defensive posture.  Upon taking in the hall's layout, he apologized via mental transmission, "My apologies for the abruptness, fellow Daoist. Please forgive my rudeness."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, dismissing the incident, and feigned sleep in his seat.</p><p>More and more people continued to arrive.</p><p>Past the middle of the Hai hour, the hall was nearly full. The influx of newcomers slowed to a trickle. After a brief wait, a ripple of energy emanated from the darkness behind the platform.</p><p>The assembled cultivators straightened, their attention piqued.  A procession of guards, dressed in Yin Mountain Garrison uniforms, emerged and dispersed to the four corners of the hall, assuming defensive positions.</p><p>Finally, a middle-aged cultivator in brocade robes, with striking sword-like eyebrows, stepped forward.</p><p>He ascended the platform with measured steps, paused briefly, and addressed the crowd in a resonant voice, "Greetings, fellow Daoists. I am Gao Yi, and I have the honor of serving as the commander of the Yin Mountain Garrison. I shall be presiding over this auction. I apologize in advance for any shortcomings."</p><p>A chorus of polite greetings responded to Gao Yi's introduction.</p><p>Qin Sang observed Gao Yi discreetly.  Steward Pu had informed him of this man's identity – the Garrison's highest-ranking commander, whose cultivation rivaled that of Senior Brother Qi Yuanhu. A False Core realm expert!</p><p>Gao Yi was renowned, and feared, for his ruthlessness. Countless cultivators had perished at his hands.  Some whispered that he was the most powerful cultivator in the Lesser Cold Realm, second only to those who had formed a true Golden Core.</p><p>For an auction involving Foundation Establishment and Qi Refinement cultivators, a Golden Core overseer wasn't necessary.  Gao Yi's presence alone was sufficient to maintain order.  None dared to act out of line.</p><p>"I presume you are all familiar with the rules of the auction, so I won't belabor them. However, a reminder is in order..."</p><p>Gao Yi's expression hardened, his voice laced with killing intent.  "Regardless of your background or status, abandon any treacherous intentions you may harbor! The Yin Mountain Garrison will not hesitate to eliminate any transgressors!"</p><p>Silenced by Gao Yi's chilling aura, the hall fell deathly quiet. A palpable sense of dread hung in the air.</p>
