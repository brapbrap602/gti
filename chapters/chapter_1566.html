<h1></h1><p>Two mountains stood close together, appearing from a certain angle like a cuddling couple.</p><p>Local cultivators called them the Male and Female Mountains.</p><p>Entering the basin through the pass of the Male and Female Mountains was one of the safe paths discovered by local cultivators over countless years.  A group of low-level cultivators gathered on the mountains.</p><p>The miasma in the basin followed a distinct pattern: rising at night and settling during the day.</p><p>Night was the most dangerous time.</p><p>As soon as the sun set, they would flee the basin, waiting on the Male and Female Mountains for the next day's sunrise. Those with higher cultivation or those who had prepared detoxifying spirit medicines could endure the miasma for a longer time, but even they had to come out after a while to recover.</p><p>The Male and Female Mountains were once magnificent, having formed a modest market town. As the resources in this area were exhausted, it gradually declined, and those merchant guilds relocated elsewhere.</p><p>Now, only these low-level cultivators remained here, barely making ends meet.</p><p>The former glory was gone.</p><p>They entered the dilapidated market town, casually found a few empty rooms, and took out various bottles, jars, and herbs. They boiled them into a medicinal soup, each taking a bowl. Immediately, sweat poured from their bodies, dispelling the miasma's poison within them.</p><p>They had performed similar actions countless times, and their movements were extremely practiced.</p><p>Their spirits restored, they chatted and laughed, sorting through their harvest from this trip.</p><p>"Sigh! The herbs around the Male and Female Mountains are becoming increasingly scarce. This time's harvest is only eighty percent of the last. At this rate, when will we be able to exchange for a dose of Spirit Transformation Powder?"</p><p>The leader, a sturdy man, looked depressed.</p><p>"Heh heh, even with Spirit Transformation Powder and breaking through the tenth level of Qi Refining, we still need to gather spirit stones to buy Foundation Establishment Pills, and one pill may not even be enough for the breakthrough.  If even you, Boss, find it so difficult, we dare not even dream of it.  Earning a little nest egg, returning home to marry eight or ten wives, and hoping for a child with good natural talent is enough," someone chimed in jokingly.</p><p>"That's easy enough. If we find a Spirit Illusion Flower, we'll be rich! A few Foundation Establishment Pills would be nothing.  Isn't there a legend?  A guy got a top-grade Spirit Illusion Flower seed, and it's said the merchant guild that took it turned around and sold it to an important person for dozens of times the price. Even so, that guy made a fortune and moved his entire family away," the second-in-command said with a look of envy.</p><p>Someone next to him spat, "Second Brother, you're just talking nonsense.  It's true that the Spirit Illusion Flower is precious, but it only appears when the miasma is at its fiercest. With our meager cultivation, we wouldn't even know how we died if we went in..."</p><p>Before he finished speaking,</p><p>The door suddenly creaked open, pushed from the outside, and two people walked in.</p><p>Everyone was startled, grabbing their respective magical instruments as if facing a formidable enemy.</p><p>The sturdy leader carefully examined the two uninvited guests. The more he looked, the more apprehensive he became. He held back his companions, stepped forward, and cupped his hands, saying, "Meeting is fate. The night is cold. If you two friends are looking for a place to stay, I'll have my brothers give up a room for you."</p><p>The newcomers were Qin Sang and Lu Zhang.</p><p>Lu Zhang was eager to find traces of the Stone Toad and didn't bother with pleasantries. He merely released a wisp of True Essence, and the group collapsed, leaving only the leader with a look of terror on his face.</p><p>"Where do the Spirit Illusion Flowers you mentioned appear?"</p><p>The leader's legs went weak, and his voice trembled, "Reporting to Senior, we've only heard rumors.  We hear that the location changes each time, but it's roughly in the center of the basin.  If Senior wishes to inquire about more accurate information, there's a market town eight hundred miles west. Someone there will definitely know..."</p><p>Lu Zhang nodded slightly, tossed the leader a few spirit stones, and turned to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered something and interjected, "Do you know what god the nearby villages worship?"</p><p>The leader thought for a moment and cautiously replied, "Is Senior referring to the Gu God Cult? This junior has heard something about it. It's all stuff those travelling merchants use to amass wealth, fooling the common folk. They spread the Gu God Cult everywhere, using its name to sell herbs with hallucinogenic effects to those villages at high prices... We don't believe in it."</p><p>No wonder those mortals were so fanatical.</p><p>Consuming hallucinogenic herbs, their bodies were affected by the medicinal power over the years. Coupled with psychological suggestion, even the simplest talisman water could have a certain effect in the end.</p><p>If they consumed such drugs every day, a mortal's body would have long since collapsed.</p><p>It was only spread among mortals, yet the upper echelons had Nascent Soul protectors.</p><p>Such a disconnect, were they truly the same organization?</p><p>Qin Sang felt a strange sense of unease.</p><p>The two left the Male and Female Mountains, entered the market town, made some inquiries, and then, braving the heavy miasma, entered the basin without stopping.</p><p>The interval at which the Stone Toad emerged to absorb purple qi sometimes lasted for decades.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Zhang judged that this Stone Toad was close to maturity and could transform and escape at any time. They couldn't simply wait outside.</p><p>The area where the Stone Toad scattered its spores had a certain range, and its main body was definitely hidden within this area. However, the range was not small, requiring them to search carefully, and it was uncertain whether it was on the surface or underground.</p><p>It was said that the basin was riddled with underground tunnels, crisscrossing in all directions, the source of the miasma, and extremely dangerous.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>Qin Sang and Lu Zhang descended directly to the ground, the miasma rushing towards them. They circulated their True Essence, forming a protective barrier. Looking up again, the dense miasma blocked the moonlight.</p><p>Both their vision and spiritual senses were affected.</p><p>Based on the information he had gathered, Lu Zhang drew a rough range. He flew through the miasma for a while, and upon reaching the target area, he took out the Treasured-Colored Bell.</p><p>'Ring, ring, ring...'</p><p>In the empty basin, the bell's sound seemed particularly clear.</p><p>The treasured light formed a halo, spreading far and wide.</p><p>Lu Zhang could isolate the bell's sound within the vicinity, but he couldn't conceal the fluctuations of the treasured light, otherwise, the Treasured-Colored Bell would lose its effect of breaking illusions.</p><p>Ordinary treasures couldn't see through the Stone Toad's camouflage.</p><p>They had contacted several merchant guilds on their way but hadn't encountered any magical treasures that satisfied them. They could only rely on the Treasured-Colored Bell. There was no need to separate; one person manipulated the bell, while the other remained vigilant, taking turns in this manner.</p><p>Lu Zhang held the Treasured-Colored Bell in his palm, nodded to Qin Sang, and began his search.</p><p>Maintaining a distance of several zhang from Lu Zhang, Qin Sang, while Lu Zhang wasn't paying attention, released his True Essence barrier and actively drew a wisp of miasma into his body.</p><p>The miasma circulated within his body, but Qin Sang didn't feel any obvious discomfort.</p><p>Clearly, this miasma caused the most damage to the physical body. His avatar was a Spiritwood body, immune to this kind of damage to a certain extent.</p><p>This was a great advantage for their subsequent actions.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that the possibility of finding the Stone Toad on the surface was slim; they would definitely have to go underground.</p><p>The underground environment was cramped, the source of the miasma.  Resisting the miasma while maintaining the Treasured-Colored Bell would be a considerable burden.  Not to mention, the poisonous beasts and insects hidden underground would also be attracted by the fluctuations of the Treasured-Colored Bell and attack them.</p><p>Besides them, few would dare to enter the depths of the basin at this time.</p><p>They searched all night without encountering a third person.</p><p>As expected, many poisonous creatures were attracted, all easily dealt with by Qin Sang.</p><p>By the next morning, the miasma began to recede. Even at its lowest point, a layer remained on the ground, and their pressure wouldn't decrease because of this.</p><p>However, their movements were more cautious than at night.</p><p>They had already ascertained that although this wasn't the cultivation grounds of some great cultivator, the Southern Continent wasn't lacking in Nascent Soul powers. Too much commotion would attract the attention of local powerhouses, causing unnecessary complications.</p><p>The two took turns several times, finally searching the entire surface. As expected, they didn't find the Stone Toad, and finally arrived at the entrance of an underground tunnel.</p><p>The entire basin was full of such entrances, covered with decaying matter.  Brushing it aside revealed the openings, some as narrow as cracks in stone, others large enough for dozens of people to enter.</p><p>Every entrance was filled with miasma, which would continuously erupt from within at night.</p><p>"Let's go down from here."</p><p>Lu Zhang said.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, handed the Treasured-Colored Bell to Lu Zhang, took out spirit stones, and held them in his hand, restoring his True Essence.</p><p>The one they chose wasn't too wide or too narrow. It was said that the underground tunnels were all interconnected, rarely leading to dead ends.  Entering from any location was the same.</p><p>Even during the day, very few cultivators dared to enter underground.</p><p>Just how deep the underground tunnels were remained undetermined.</p><p>Qin Sang and Lu Zhang were prepared to measure it themselves.</p><p>They fixed on a direction, passing through tunnel after tunnel, descending continuously. They had lost count of how far they had gone, finally reaching a tunnel that may or may not have been the end.</p><p>The miasma here was as thick as water, like an underground river of miasma.</p><p>Qin Sang was fine, but Lu Zhang had to expend more True Essence to resist the miasma.</p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p>Qin Sang had a bit of a headache. "To search this entire area will probably take two or three months.  I only hope that Stone Toad hasn't moved around."</p><p>Lu Zhang hadn't expected it to be so troublesome, and said helplessly, "Before maturity, the Stone Toad can only move by instinct, not very fast, and it generally won't leave the nest where it was born... I'll have to delay Daoist Priest for a while longer."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, "Since I promised Daoist Friend Lu, I will certainly see it through to the end."</p><p>The two didn't say more, silently starting to move.</p><p>The underground tunnels crisscrossed.</p><p>Some were straight, some curved, their paths unpredictable.</p><p>Fortunately, both were Nascent Soul cultivators, and no matter how complex the terrain, it couldn't confuse them.</p><p>Qin Sang constructed a map of the terrain in his mind.</p><p>Time passed day by day, and the map gradually filled out, the tunnels becoming clear.</p><p>A month passed in a blink.</p><p>They had searched nearly half the area, still without any trace of the Stone Toad.  But both were individuals with firm resolve and wouldn't waver in their determination.</p><p>There were some gains.</p><p>Qin Sang obtained many bones and poison cores of poisonous beasts and insects, which he would take back to see if Fatty Silkworm liked any of them.  Seeing Qin Sang's interest in these things, Lu Zhang gave them all to him.</p><p>The two passed through a tunnel several thousand zhang long.</p><p>The end connected to a stone passage, which was the widest they had encountered during this time.</p><p>Lu Zhang observed briefly, then activated the Treasured-Colored Bell and entered the stone passage first.</p><p>Qin Sang followed behind.</p><p>The treasured light illuminated one side of the stone wall, and the bell's sound only echoed around them.</p><p>They were like passersby carrying lanterns, silently moving forward.</p><p>After walking for a while, a suspicious look appeared in Qin Sang's eyes. He suddenly called out to Lu Zhang, "Daoist Friend Lu, something's not right here. We've walked for so long, and yet haven't seen a single poisonous insect or beast."</p><p>Lu Zhang stopped, his expression also becoming more serious.</p><p>Based on their experience, the most likely reason for this was that the vicinity was the nest of a poisonous beast king. Other poisonous beasts wouldn't dare approach the king's territory.</p><p>During this period, the strongest poisonous beast they had encountered was a Core Formation middle-stage venomous python.</p><p>Could there be a Transformation stage great demon or a fourth-transformation spirit insect here?</p><p>The poisonous beasts and insects that dwelled here were most likely skilled in poison manipulation techniques, posing a greater threat in this special environment.  They didn't dare to be careless.</p><p>Lu Zhang compressed the range of the Treasured-Colored Bell.</p><p>Qin Sang gripped the Snow-Treading Divine Blade in his palm.</p><p>They proceeded for a while longer without being attacked.</p><p>Just as they were about to exit this stone passage, a rustling sound suddenly came from the depths of the miasma, very faint, like the sound of scales rubbing against the ground.</p><p>Lu Zhang reacted extremely quickly, pressing down on the Treasured-Colored Bell.</p><p>Qin Sang's footsteps immediately stopped.</p><p>The two exchanged glances, communicating through sound transmission for a few sentences. Lu Zhang went ahead to scout, while Qin Sang, gripping the Snow-Treading Divine Blade, secretly prepared his Profound Qi Giant Hand.</p><p>The two, one in front and one behind, hadn't walked far when they saw a dim yellow light ahead.</p><p>The light flickered.</p><p>After a few more steps, they finally saw the situation clearly.</p><p>It was indeed a ball of fire.</p><p>This ball of fire floated above the ground, expanding and contracting. The flames enveloped a poisonous spider the size of a human head, its aura weak, on the verge of death.</p><p>The flames clung tightly to the spider's body, burning through its outer shell.</p><p>The spider felt the pain, its body convulsing, but it couldn't resist the flames. In the blink of an eye, its flesh and blood were devoured by the flames, leaving only its outer shell.</p><p>Lu Zhang frowned, unable to recall the origin of this type of flame for a moment.</p><p>"It's a Corpseflame Moth!"</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>He collected secret manuals on insect control techniques everywhere and recognized this type of poisonous insect.</p><p>Like Phosphorescent Fireflies, Corpseflame Moths were social spirit insects, gathering and scattering like fire. The firelight was their camouflage, actually poisonous powder on their bodies, containing a deadly poison.</p><p>The ball of fire detached from the spider's corpse.</p><p>Faintly, within the firelight, dozens of yellow poisonous moths the size of fingernails could be seen, huddled together like the core of the flame.</p><p>"A swarm of Corpseflame Moths. How many are there?" Lu Zhang asked in a deep voice.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, "It's uncertain. At least a few hundred, at most..."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the miasma ahead suddenly stirred, and dim yellow lights lit up one after another, densely packed.  There were over a thousand balls of light visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Only in this poisonous miasma land could so many Corpseflame Moths be bred!</p><p>"They've discovered us," Lu Zhang said. A ring of light burst forth from his body, sweeping the surrounding void. He shouted, "Poisonous powder!"</p><p>'Buzz!'</p><p>A buzzing sound suddenly erupted, and in the enclosed underground space, the sound seemed to have the power to pierce eardrums.</p><p>In an instant, all the firelights gathered together, then rushed towards them, instinctively devouring any living creature they encountered.</p><p>The stone passage brightened.</p><p>Endless poisonous powder swept towards them like a hurricane.</p><p>It was hard to imagine that such small Corpseflame Moths could launch such a terrifying attack.</p><p>Without a word, Qin Sang flicked his wrist, and the Snow-Treading Divine Blade shot out with a cold light, carving a path of snow.</p><p>The sharp blade qi split the firelight in two like a hot knife through butter.</p><p>The corpses of the Corpseflame Moths were frozen into ice chips and fell to the ground, but the swarm was unaffected, dividing and merging, relentlessly pressing forward.</p><p>Lu Zhang wasn't slow either.  A cyan light flashed from between his eyebrows, then spread across his entire body, finally enveloping Qin Sang as well, transforming into an ancient cyan bell.</p><p>Protected by the ancient bell, the cyan light rolled back towards the swarm, cooperating with the Snow-Treading Divine Blade to divide the swarm.</p><p>Just as they were battling the swarm,</p><p>Deep underground,</p><p>In an unknown location,</p><p>An angry grunt echoed through the darkness.</p>
