<h1>Chapter 1602: The Withered and Flourishing Old Devil</h1><p>“What news have you received?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, knowing Jiang Mu wouldn't speak without reason.</p><p>Jiang Mu handed Qin Sang a jade slip.  “There are rumors, but none confirmed.  Truth mixed with falsehood, hard to discern!  From various clues, it seems some seemingly ordinary factions and individuals aren't so simple…”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced through it.  The rumors were all speculation. He chuckled. “Real hidden sects wouldn't reveal themselves so quickly, would they? What are they plotting? Surely not to overthrow the Eight Views Sect and the Ganlu Zen Monastery?”</p><p>“Those two great immortal sects are behemoths. For now, no one dares challenge them. But if Nascent Soul cultivators continue to be absent, who knows?  Someone will surely covet their position.”</p><p>Jiang Mu paused, his voice hushed. “Let me ask you this, Elder Qin, don't you find it curious?  Even the Tian Hao Tower, the strongest of the Demon Sects, has seen intermittent appearances of Nascent Soul cultivators. Why do the Eight Views Sect and the Ganlu Zen Monastery consistently produce them?  Are all the exceptionally talented individuals in the world being recruited by these two sects?”</p><p>“Brother Jiang means…the two great sects possess some sort of Nascent Soul cultivation technique, and with exceptionally high success rates…”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>In fact, after learning about the Eight Views Sect and the Ganlu Zen Monastery, he'd had similar suspicions.  The consistent emergence of talented individuals from both sects, starting with True Monarch Huang Xi and Saintly One Liao Su, and their continued dominance, wasn't accidental.</p><p>“These are just my own ramblings, not to be taken seriously.”</p><p>Even so, Jiang Mu didn't think he was wrong.  “These matters are too far removed for me. I'll stick to the basics and hope to one day catch up to Elder Qin’s cultivation.  But for great cultivators like you, achieving Nascent Soul isn't a pipe dream, it's something worth pursuing at all costs! Some will have the same thoughts as me, and be secretly plotting.  Great cultivators outside of the Daoist and Buddhist forces are natural allies. Once Elder Qin appears in Jinyu Prefecture, someone will definitely seek you out.”</p><p>Jiang Mu looked at Qin Sang subtly.</p><p>Late-stage Yuan Ying independent cultivators were rare. Qin Sang was an anomaly.</p><p>Jiang Mu always suspected Qin Sang was a disguised expert from some faction, aiming for convenient action. He wondered about the secret conversation between the Hall Master and Qin Sang that year.</p><p>“Thank you for the warning, Brother Jiang. I'm alone and unafraid of strong enemies, but I won't allow myself to be used. I hope Hall Master Mu can offer guidance when the time comes…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought, his purpose in attending the Ullambana Festival in Jinyu Prefecture was partially this.</p><p>Even without Nascent Soul cultivators present, the Eight Views Sect and the Ganlu Zen Monastery weren't easy to deal with. He was alone and his abilities were incomplete; his best choice was to watch from the sidelines.</p><p>Before understanding the situation, Qin Sang wouldn't take sides.</p><p>However, he was very interested in the forces lurking beneath the surface, particularly the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect. He wondered if he would encounter any ‘remnants’ of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect on this trip.</p><p>As they spoke, the two arrived at the Feiyun Ferry's northern shore.</p><p>Three treasure ships waited there, ready for departure the next day.</p><p>On board were personnel sent by the Six States Hall to Jinyu Gate, as well as large cargo that couldn't fit into a dimensional pouch. The holds were packed. While the items might not be individually high-grade, the sheer quantity made them incredibly valuable; no wonder Jiang Mu was so cautious.</p><p>Jiang Mu gave the best cabin to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted without hesitation, closing himself off in the cabin for several days. He didn’t even appear when the ship set sail.</p><p>The fleet sailed north along the Feiyun River, passed Longju Wharf, entered Zhuo Prefecture, and learned en route that the Longju Cave Heaven group had already departed on cloud chariots.</p><p>As they were leaving Zhuo Prefecture and entering Zhaoyao Prefecture…</p><p>In the dead of night, the full moon shone on the river.</p><p>The water shimmered.</p><p>The treasure ship suddenly stopped.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed something was amiss and went out. He saw Jiang Mu standing at the stern, his expression grave, staring at the river.</p><p>Behind them, the sound of rushing water grew louder. A large ship was rapidly approaching from the middle of the river.</p><p>Under the moonlight, the ship was like a black beast, imposing and reckless. Smaller boats along its path hastily moved out of the way.</p><p>The ship displayed no flags or markings to indicate its identity.</p><p>Only the high, curved prow, inlaid with an ancient mirror, reflected the bright moonlight, illuminating a large area of the river. Anyone bathed in this moonlight felt an inexplicable sense of constraint.</p><p>Qin Sang was no exception. Although it didn’t affect him, it was quite uncomfortable.</p><p>He vaguely sensed several hidden yet powerful auras on the ship.</p><p>“It’s the Tian Hao Tower!”</p><p>Jiang Mu murmured, immediately giving orders to change course and avoid the ship.</p><p>Qin Sang thought, *No wonder.*</p><p>The foremost sect of the Demon Gate, even without a Nascent Soul cultivator, is not necessarily weaker than the Eight Scenic Views or the Ganlu Zen Monastery!</p><p>His gaze shifted to the ancient mirror at the bow, and he asked in a low voice, "Is this the Tian Hao Tower's treasured artifact—the Tian Hao Ancient Mirror?"</p><p>Jiang Mu shook his head slightly. "It's a replica. Its power is far inferior to the real Tian Hao Ancient Mirror. Legend says the real mirror cannot leave the Tian Hao Tower, whether that's true or not, I don't know! However, it's said the replica was refined using a special technique, perfectly matching the ship's formation, allowing it to exert extraordinary power."</p><p>While the two exchanged words in hushed tones, the ship drew closer, the waves forming two thick walls of water, rushing towards them.</p><p>Just as they were about to pass.</p><p>A surprised exclamation echoed from the ship. Then, the treasure ship came to an abrupt halt, stopping beside them. The water walls subsided, leaving less than a thousand feet between the two vessels.</p><p>Jiang Mu's expression changed.</p><p>A figure flickered into view at the ship's bow, standing there, looking towards them. "I wonder which fellow Daoist from the Six States Hall this is? Is it Hall Master Mu?"</p><p>The speaker was a young man.</p><p>The young man was dressed in a brocade robe, his face somewhat gaunt, with high cheekbones. His appearance was deceptively youthful, yet he had white hair and eyebrows, long and drooping.</p><p>Jiang Mu bowed and said solemnly, "Jiang Mu of the Six States Hall, I greet Master Kūróng. The Hall Master has some business to attend to further back and will arrive shortly."</p><p>As he spoke, he transmitted a message to Qin Sang, his tone grave.</p><p>"That's Kūróng the Fiend!"</p><p>Qin Sang stood half a step behind Jiang Mu, hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>'Master' was an honorific used in Tian Hao Tower for great cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang had long heard of Kūróng the Fiend.</p><p>This person's current fame was still less than that of the Tian Hao Tower's master and Grand Elder, but he was considered the best candidate for the next sect master, a future leading figure in the demonic path.</p><p>Kūróng the Fiend had a small reputation even before reaching the Yuan Ying stage. He cultivated a strange demonic art from Tian Hao Tower, appearing aged like a centenarian despite his young age.</p><p>Not only his appearance, but also his internal energy would correspondingly weaken, and even his lifespan would be reduced.</p><p>Those who cultivate this demonic art experience rapid aging overnight, having to contend with various disadvantages and race against time to break through. Only those with exceptional talent would dare cultivate it.</p><p>As their cultivation improved, this condition would improve, and the cultivator's appearance would become increasingly younger.</p><p>Upon achieving the rank of Grand Cultivator, a vast world would open up before them!</p><p>Since the establishment of Tian Hao Tower, only a handful had successfully cultivated this demonic art, and Kūróng the Fiend was not only a successful cultivator but also the youngest of them all.</p><p>"He's not coming, so just say he's coming later. Are you afraid I'll destroy your fleet?"</p><p>Kūróng the Fiend let out a strange laugh, his long eyebrows twitching. His gaze shifted to Qin Sang behind Jiang Mu, and after a brief examination, he showed a look of surprise. "This fellow Daoist looks unfamiliar."</p><p>Jiang Mu stammered, introducing Qin Sang, "This is Elder Qin, a guest elder of our hall."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded with a smile. "I've long admired Daoist Kūróng's great name. Seeing you today, your demeanor truly lives up to the reputation!"</p><p>Kūróng the Fiend stared intently at Qin Sang, his surprise growing stronger with each glance.</p><p>Inside the ship, other experts from Tian Hao Tower noticed Kūróng the Fiend's unusual behavior.</p><p>Several strands of divine sense probed covertly, but Qin Sang repelled them without hesitation.</p><p>Several muffled groans sounded from the ship.</p><p>"Don't be so impudent!"</p><p>Kūróng the Fiend shouted into the ship's cabin, his tone a stark contrast to his earlier casual demeanor towards Jiang Mu. He said sternly, "My subordinates were out of line. Daoist Qin, please forgive them."</p><p>"It's alright," Qin Sang's smile remained unchanged.</p><p>"With Daoist Qin joining, the Six States Hall will be even stronger, securing its position as the number one trading house in the world! Excuse my poor eyesight, but I'm unaware of Daoist Qin's origin."</p><p>Kūróng the Fiend racked his brains but couldn't figure out which sect or school Qin Sang belonged to.</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently, "I'm a lone wanderer with no fixed abode. It's normal that you haven't heard of me. Is Daoist Kūróng the only one participating in the Ullambana Assembly this year? Are Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan on the ship? I've long admired them."</p><p>Elder Fan was the current Grand Elder of Tian Hao Tower, holding equal status with Sect Master Yu. Kūróng the Fiend ranked slightly lower than them.</p><p>"The Sect Master is currently engaged in a crucial secret technique and cannot leave seclusion. The Grand Elder has other important matters and may not have time to go to Jinyu State."</p><p>Kūróng the Fiend's answer was unexpected.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jiang Mu exchanged a glance.</p><p>They had discussed earlier that without the deterrent of a Nascent Soul cultivator, Tian Hao Tower would certainly not remain idle. Even if they didn't appear personally, they would secretly stir up trouble.</p><p>Unexpectedly, only Kūróng the Fiend had come.</p><p>Or perhaps they were already hidden in the shadows, plotting their moves?</p><p>Qin Sang thought it was strange.</p><p>During this Ullambana Assembly, Mount Bunan was closed, the whereabouts of Tian Hao Tower's two masters were unknown, and other immortal sects might cause some trouble.</p><p>Jin Yumeng's plans for an unprecedented grand ceremony seem unlikely to materialize.</p><p>Kuru Rongmo invited Qin Sang aboard his ship for a meeting, but Qin Sang politely refused.</p><p>With the situation unclear, he didn't want to get too close to any sect, especially Tian Hao Lou.  They exchanged a few words from a distance.</p><p>Kuru Rongmo sensed Qin Sang's coolness and didn't press further.</p><p>After this brief incident, the fleet entered central Zhaoyao Prefecture, turned east via the largest tributary of the Feiyun River, and sailed into Jinyu Prefecture.</p><p>The tributary's mouth is located in Jinyu Prefecture, home to Hongcheng, the prefecture's most prosperous market, controlled by the Jinyu Sect.</p><p>The Ullambana Festival will be held in Hongcheng.</p><p>Openly robbing a large merchant guild, especially one with a Yuan Ying cultivator, is quite rare.</p><p>They entered Jinyu Prefecture without incident.</p><p>Even before reaching Hongcheng, the influence of the Ullambana Festival was palpable.  Countless treasure ships crowded the river, and colorful escape lights constantly streaked across the sky, either solo or in groups.</p><p>Regardless of cultivation level, nobody wanted to miss this quincentennial event.</p><p>Five hundred years could encompass the entire lifespan of a Golden Core cultivator!</p><p>Aware of the unrest in the cultivation world, the Jinyu Sect stationed disciples along the riverbanks for patrol and deterrence, making this leg of the journey far safer than in Zhaoyao Prefecture.</p><p>…</p><p>"Elder Qin, Hongcheng has arrived."</p><p>Someone outside the cabin manipulated the restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke, retracted his divine ability, and stepped outside.  He saw Jiang Mu directing the treasure ship to dock, then ascended to the deck alone.  "What a magnificent Rainbow City!"</p><p>Feiyun Ferry is suspended in the air.</p><p>Hongcheng is built into the mountains.</p><p>The estuary isn't flanked by plains; rolling hills and towering peaks surround it.</p><p>These peaks are all utilized, comparable to the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches areas of Feiyun Ferry, differentiated by location and size into different levels and functions.</p><p>Countless rainbow bridges, varying in length, connect the mountain peaks, crisscrossing without any sense of disorder, forming a unique beauty.</p><p>From afar, the entire city resembles a giant rainbow bridge.</p><p>The Mountain and Sea Gate!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't need to concern himself with the following mundane matters.  Disciples from his base met him and guided him to the Six States Hall's base, coincidentally where Gong Xingqing was stationed, the one Qin Sang had intimidated earlier.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang again, he had transformed into a guest elder of the merchant guild.</p><p>Gong Xingqing, however, hadn't forgotten the feeling of being overwhelmed by the great cultivator's aura, and nervously introduced the Jinyu Sect's arrangements.</p><p>The north and south sides of the estuary serve different functions.</p><p>The south bank is home to commoners, independent cultivators, and some smaller sects.</p><p>The north bank is the core of Hongcheng.</p><p>The layout of the main peak on the north bank is highly regular, leading Qin Sang to suspect the use of earth-moving divine abilities.</p><p>With the main peak at its center, the other peaks are arranged in a Bagua formation, decreasing in height as they extend outwards.</p><p>The two grand auctions and the Ullambana Festival are all held on the main peak; the Jinyu Sect had completed preparations decades ago.  The Six States Hall maintains a low profile; its base is located on a medium-sized mountain southwest of the main peak.</p><p>Of course, the Six States Hall's own treasure exchange and auction are still held near the main peak.</p><p>He ascended a rainbow bridge.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the local customs with great interest and inquired about the Six States Hall personnel.  He learned that Hall Master Mu and Deputy Hall Master Lei hadn't arrived yet, only Deputy Hall Master Jiang You was in Hongcheng.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang and Gong Xingqing reached their destination.</p><p>After exchanging pleasantries with Deputy Hall Master Jiang You, Jiang You mentioned Hall Master Mu's whereabouts, "The Hall Master is in the East Sea, handling a thorny matter."</p><p>"Oh? What important matter? Can Qin use his skills?"</p><p>"It's not a major event, but it will take time. The Hall Master's personal presence is sufficient; otherwise, we'd definitely ask Elder Qin to come out of seclusion," Jiang You chuckled.</p><p>As Qin Sang was merely a guest elder, he didn't ask further, turning instead to the situation in Hongcheng.</p><p>"Master Xingji led several Zen masters to Hongcheng a month ago, staying with the Jinyu Sect. Yesterday, the experts from the Eight Scenery arrived, quite a number, though only the Grand Cultivator, Zi Lei Zhenren, leads them. They found a secluded courtyard on the main peak and rarely go out.  Over ninety percent of the famous sects from the Central Plains have arrived.  Only the Bu Nian Mountain remains closed, and Yue Lingtian of Taiyue Sect and the Poison King of Wan Du Mountain are still missing."</p><p>Jiang You, stationed in Hongcheng, had a thorough grasp of the various factions' movements.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this.</p><p>The Buddhist sect leads the Ullambana Festival, but the ceremony is held alternately by Daoist and Buddhist sects. The Eight Scenery, considering their own Zhongyuan Festival, would always show face, and in the past, at least two Grand Cultivators would attend.</p><p>However, given Zi Lei Zhenren's status as the观主 (Guan Zhu, meaning something akin to an abbot or head of a temple or similar religious institution), his attendance is sufficient explanation.</p><p>Taiyue Sect and Wan Du Mountain are far away in the Southern Barbarian Prefectures; their delayed arrival is normal.</p><p>Furthermore, individuals have come from the Northern Wastelands, Western Desert, and East Sea to observe the ceremony.</p><p>All parties have converged in Hongcheng, making it a gathering of experts!</p>
