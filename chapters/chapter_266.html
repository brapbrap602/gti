Chapter 259: Talisman Array


Qin Sang didn’t dare to breathe while hiding among the Fire Birds.
There was a person standing in front of the stone temple on the stone platform. It was Reverend Xuanyu!
Reverend Xuanyu lifted his hand, and hundreds of spirit talismans hovered in mid-air. The spirit talismans shone like stars, forming a majestic talisman array.
Cyan spirit energy pervaded the air, and the spirit talismans looked like a starry sky hanging above the stone temple.
Qin Sang was afraid that Reverend Xuanyu would sense his gaze, so he didn’t dare to look at him directly.
He peeked at the talisman array with the corner of his eye. He felt dizzy and couldn’t understand the pattern.
This was the difference in cultivation realm.
Qin Sang couldn’t even see the true appearance of the spirit talismans.
He could only see wisps of cyan qi in his vision. Some reached down like vines, and some gathered together, making it difficult to grasp.
The spirit energy cautiously touched the stone temple. It seemed that Reverend Xuanyu was trying to break the stone temple’s restriction, but had yet to succeed.
It was hard to tell what the stone temple was used for.
This crude stone temple, which exuded an ancient and grand atmosphere, seemed more like an ancient ritual site than an ancient cultivator’s cave abode.
This place must have experienced a fierce battle. The circular restriction that sealed the magma was almost completely destroyed, and even the stone temple was severely damaged. It looked like it was about to collapse.
Perhaps it was affected by the battle, but the invisible barrier blocking the Fire Spirit Beasts was also exposed. It was the first time Qin Sang saw the barrier’s true appearance.
On the edge of the semicircular space, there was a layer of illusionary barrier that appeared and disappeared. The entire barrier was composed of countless fire bird totems. The totems were lifelike and had different postures. They looked exactly the same as real Fire Birds.
Strangely, even though the circular restriction sealing the magma had been completely destroyed, these totems were completely undamaged.
However, Qin Sang soon discovered something unusual.
Every time a Fire Bird hit the totem, a wisp of flame energy would be absorbed by the totem. Not only would it not damage the totem, it would also become a part of the totem’s power, strengthening the barrier.
Qin Sang even suspected that this totem was not used to imprison the Fire Birds.
The fire essence here could only evolve into a single type of Fire Spirit Beast, the Fire Bird, because of the totem.
The Fire Birds might be part of the totem!
Just as Qin Sang was thinking to himself,
Suddenly, Reverend Xuanyu pointed with his finger, and the dancing spirit talismans instantly stopped.
The talisman array glowed, and all the spirit talismans trembled slightly, shooting out illusions. These illusions gathered at Reverend Xuanyu’s fingertips. Countless spirit talisman illusions fused into a large spirit talisman, which transformed from illusionary to solid in the blink of an eye.
The spirit talisman was complicated and mysterious, and it was as bright as the sun in the sky.
At this moment, the crimson magma paled in comparison to the spirit talisman.
“Go!”
Reverend Xuanyu’s gaze focused, and he suddenly pointed a finger.
The spirit talisman seemed slow but was actually fast. In an instant, it hit the bluestone at the entrance of the stone temple.
‘Boom!’
The spirit talisman shattered, and the fragments were like a heavy hammer, slamming into it.
The stone temple remained motionless!
Hiding among the Fire Birds, even though Qin Sang was far away, he could still clearly feel the terrifying power of the spirit talisman and the restriction of the stone temple colliding. He discovered that the aftershocks had reached him, and his expression changed slightly as he hurriedly retreated to avoid them.
Now, he was a little doubtful about his own speculation. Perhaps the stone temple was originally this dilapidated.
Reverend Xuanyu’s talisman attack didn’t seem to have any effect on the seemingly fragile stone temple. The restriction on the stone temple was stimulated by the spirit talisman and was completely revealed. The restriction was intact, and it didn’t look like it was going to collapse at all.
Only the bluestone at the entrance was trembling nonstop. This was the breakthrough point, and it seemed very promising to open it.
Seeing this scene, Reverend Xuanyu’s expression also lit up. After a moment of contemplation, he suddenly raised his hand and pointed at the void.
Just like the scene Qin Sang saw when the Hidden Moth transformed, Reverend Xuanyu pressed his two fingers together. As he moved his fingers, a thin and solid green light was left in the void. Then, the speed of his fingers became faster and faster.
The green light twisted and turned, becoming more and more complicated. In the blink of an eye, a spirit talisman was formed.
The spirit talisman hung in mid-air, and the green light retracted.
The ancient characters on it seemed to be ancient words. Before Qin Sang could figure it out, Reverend Xuanyu flicked his finger and sent the spirit talisman into the talisman array.
Then, he continued to draw talismans.
One spirit talisman after another was created, and the power of the talisman array became stronger and stronger. Qin Sang was amazed.
Drawing so many spirit talismans in one breath, Reverend Xuanyu didn’t seem to be relaxed either. White qi rose from the top of his head, and his breath seemed a little heavy.
Finally, as the last spirit talisman was integrated, the talisman array suddenly retracted and shrank dozens of times.

To Qin Sang, the small charm formation seemed to contain the universe within. There were nebulae gleams and vanish, the beautiful scenery was second to none.

Celestial Master Xuan Yu looked up at the charm formation, nodded slightly, and smiled with satisfaction, but he did not take a break to recover. Instead, he took out a spiritual pill and swallowed it, then gave a soft shout.

"Great Heavenly Sword Charm! Come out!"

Before the words were finished, a sharp sword cry resounded through the space.

Then I saw a milky white light flying out of Celestial Master Xuan Yu's body, and instantly entered the charm formation.

"Join!"

Celestial Master Xuan Yu gave another loud shout, the charm formation shattered with a bang, the fragments did not scatter out, but all collapsed inward, and were finally absorbed by the white light.

The 本体 of the white light was also a spiritual talisman. What was surprising was that this spiritual talisman was a sword-shaped!

The sound of the sword also awakened Qin Sang.

Great Heavenly Sword Charm...

Qin Sang recited silently in his heart, thinking of the rumors he had heard before, among the four secret charms passed down by the founding patriarch of the Shangqing Palace of Yuanyang, there was a sword-shaped secret charm.

It is said that the Four Great Secret Mantras are all no less powerful than the magic weapon, and each spiritual talisman is full of mystery.

Great Heavenly Sword Charm may be one of the four great secret mantras!

The Great Heavenly Sword Charm was already extremely powerful, and after integrating the power of the charm formation, its power skyrocketed. The secret charm sword light, which was only three inches long, radiated in all directions, and the sword cry continued.

At such a distance, and the Great Heavenly Sword Charm was not aimed at Qin Sang, but Qin Sang still had the illusion of a catastrophe, as if he would be cut in half with a single knife in the next moment.

Qin Sang was secretly horrified.

I saw Celestial Master Xuan Yu's palm pressed down, and the Great Heavenly Sword Charm slowly drifted towards the bluestone. With each inch closer, the aura became stronger.

I wonder if the Great Heavenly Sword Charm can break the ban on the bluestone?

This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.

At this moment, he suddenly remembered something, the old man of the earth deficiency hadn't shown up yet!

It has been a long time since he entered the crater. With the ability of the old man with earth deficiency, he should have found a way to cover up the firebird long ago, but he still hasn't shown up.

Qin Sang frowned secretly, he found that Celestial Master Xuan Yu was not easy to control the Great Heavenly Sword Charm, he was doing his best, and had no time to take care of himself.

Is the old man with earth deficiency waiting for this moment?

He is like a venomous snake peeping in the dark, waiting for an opportunity to attack!

Qin Sang looked around calmly, his eyes were full of dense firebirds, and he couldn't see which one was disguised by the old man with earth deficiency.

Thinking of this, Qin Sang suddenly moved and stepped back, trying to keep as far away from the Stone Palace as possible.
