<h1>Chapter 1558: The Arrival of the Demon Kings</h1><p>“The inner and outer halls… are they connected within the Immortal Restriction? This might be more than just the inner hall’s Immortal Restriction; it might be connected to the entire Seven Kills Hall’s Immortal Array.”</p><p>Qin Sang guessed.</p><p>Although he saw the shadow of the Heavenly Tower, he dared not move from his spot.</p><p>The surrounding area was not only filled with dangerous radiant light, but the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth was also unusually chaotic. Qin Sang suspected that if he stepped out of the corridor, he would instantly turn to ashes.</p><p>“The ancient teleportation array is most likely here, but I don't know its exact location. If I could determine the location of the ancient teleportation array and find the way back, I wouldn't have to seek out Elder Qingzhu.”</p><p>Back on the eighth level of the Heavenly Tower, his demon soul incarnation had clearly held the upper hand. Elder Qingzhu dared not reveal even the slightest bit of confidential information and couldn't leave any messages behind.</p><p>Could Ning Wuhuai, having only refined an external Nascent Soul, help Elder Qingzhu suppress the demon soul?</p><p>Qin Sang had his doubts.</p><p>If he had the ability to help Elder Qingzhu recover, Qin Sang would gladly assist.  He was still cultivating the killing talismans Elder Qingzhu had comprehended, essentially inheriting his mantle.</p><p>Developing a good relationship with Elder Qingzhu would benefit him greatly, and being able to return to Xiaohan Domain together would be even better.</p><p>But if Elder Qingzhu were to fail and couldn't suppress the demon soul incarnation, he might be the one to suffer.</p><p>It all depended on what countermeasures Elder Qingzhu had prepared.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, but didn't see any other white jade corridors, only the one beneath his feet.</p><p>At this time, Ning Wuhuai called out and walked deeper into the white jade corridor. Qin Sang dismissed his thoughts and quickly followed.</p><p>…</p><p>Deep within the幽谷 (Yougu, a secluded valley).</p><p>A group of people were traversing mountains and valleys within the secluded valley.</p><p>The various Demon Kings each used their abilities to resist the intense poison.</p><p>When they had just passed through the mountain path and entered the secluded valley, they were faced with a vast desert. Following the sensing of the Jiao Dragon King, they searched and found their way here. The terrain began to change, leading them into the deep mountains.</p><p>玄龟 (Xuangu, a mythical turtle) phantom appeared on the carapace of the broad-shouldered, turtle-backed man. The inside was like a small world. The Xuangu phantom emerged from the water, stretched its long neck, looked towards the sky, and its mouth puffed in and out, inhaling and exhaling.</p><p>Each inhalation and exhalation would release a peculiar aura.</p><p>The aura shot out from the carapace, transforming into a stream of water, finally forming a water shield, blocking the intense poison from outside. However, the shield was also stained by the poison, with wisps of black gas seeping in.</p><p>Two Demon Kings, who had recently recovered from serious injuries, leaned closely beside the broad-shouldered, turtle-backed man, using the water shield for protection while quickly recovering.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King seemed much more relaxed. His body shone with golden light, as if forged from gold. A sizzling sound came from the edge of the golden light as the intense poison was burned away by the golden light, unable to approach.</p><p>Pieces of golden light also fell onto Jiu Feng Wang, who followed the Jiao Dragon King.</p><p>“The direction we’re going should be the way out of the secluded valley, right? It's strange; the further we go, the more intense the poison becomes.”</p><p>The broad-shouldered, turtle-backed man made a hand seal, and the Xuangu's breathing rate increased slightly, making the shield thicker.</p><p>He was a little impatient and grumbled in a low voice.</p><p>“There isn't much information we could find about this secluded valley. I see that Black Brother is still resisting quite easily, so don't worry.  No matter how strong the intense poison is, it has its limits. I can feel that we're getting closer and closer to the True Dragon's remains.”</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King held the dragon bone tightly in his hand, his voice filled with excitement.</p><p>The greatest danger in the depths of the secluded valley came from the colorless and odorless intense poison, but compared to the other side of the mountain range, it was insignificant.  They were all transformed great demons; even if they encountered troublesome beasts after entering the secluded valley, they could quickly deal with them, and they hadn't suffered any more casualties.</p><p>After a brief discussion, the Demon Kings decided to speed up.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King and Jiu Feng Wang led the way, while the broad-shouldered, turtle-backed man brought up the rear, rushing through the mountains.  After crossing countless mountain ranges, a towering giant peak suddenly came into view.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King paused, staring at the giant peak, his eyes shifting.</p><p>“That mountain!”</p><p>The broad-shouldered, turtle-backed man was startled.</p><p>After entering the Seven Kills Hall, including the inner and outer halls, there were many magnificent peaks that reached the height of the Immortal Restriction, with radiant light swirling around their peaks.  But this was the first time they had seen a divine peak with such magnificent momentum.</p><p>A powerfully built warrior suddenly remembered something, exclaiming in surprise, "Could this mountain be the legendary Yitian Peak? If I'm not mistaken, near Yitian Peak lies a strange area called Zhenling Region, said to be extremely dangerous. Human cultivators avoid it like the plague…Could the dragon corpse be there?"</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King chuckled wryly, "Brother Hei guessed right. The secret technique points to the vicinity of Yitian Peak."</p><p>The various demon kings exchanged glances.</p><p>Cultivators have occupied Qisha Hall for many years, producing many outstanding talents, including numerous late-stage Yuan Ying cultivators.  The fact that so many powerful ancestors were wary of Yitian Peak and Zhenling Region must mean something.</p><p>Their understanding of Yitian Peak is far less than that of the cultivators.  Rashly entering could have unpredictable consequences.</p><p>"We've come this far, we can't give up now!  The restrictions that baffled the cultivators, we may have a way to overcome. Cultivators can only enter through the main gate, but we can use the Nine Phoenix King and the Celestial Phoenix Feather, proving our advantage. If this truly is a dragon burial ground, Yitian Peak might even be an ancestral abode of our demon race…"</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King said gravely, his voice trailing off as he flashed towards Yitian Peak.</p><p>The other demon kings silently followed.</p><p>Giving up now would be unacceptable.</p><p>Yitian Peak loomed closer.</p><p>The demon kings suppressed their auras, moving cautiously to avoid detection by cultivators.</p><p>"Yitian Peak truly lives up to its name.  Even Wushen Mountain, hailed as the highest peak of the Canglang Sea, is no match for this!"</p><p>One demon king exclaimed, recalling a previous infiltration of Wushen Mountain on Wushen Continent.</p><p>Yitian Peak stood like a colossal pillar piercing the heavens.</p><p>The mist obscured their view, preventing them from seeing its entirety. Yet, inexplicably, looking up at the mountain, they felt an aura unlike any other peak, making them feel their own insignificance.</p><p>Ancient halls, immortal pavilions, and wondrous peaks and walls were hidden amongst the dense forests.</p><p>However, the valley was deathly silent, with all the vegetation petrified, suggesting that Yitian Peak was similarly affected.</p><p>After walking for a while, the Jiao Dragon King, having just crossed a mountain, seemed to discover something, abruptly gesturing for everyone to stop.</p><p>"Something's amiss up ahead."</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King said in a low voice.</p><p>The demon kings approached, sensing a strange, unprecedented fluctuation in the void ahead.</p><p>"Zhenling Region,"</p><p>The armored warrior declared confidently, "No doubt about it.  With Yitian Peak as its center, a step further will take us into Zhenling Region!  I didn't expect it to be so vast!"</p><p>At that moment, several mountain ranges and a stone forest still separated them from Yitian Peak.</p><p>Approaching closer, they realized Yitian Peak was not a dangerously steep, solitary peak; its mountain range was vast and majestic, like a giant wall blocking their path and obscuring their view.</p><p>Surprisingly, both Zhenling Region and Yitian Peak appeared calm. Aside from the strange restrictive fluctuations, there were no visible dangers.</p><p>"Zhenling Region… I'll see what makes the cultivators so wary."</p><p>After observing for a moment without finding anything, the Jiao Dragon King sneered, his golden light transforming into golden armor as he grasped his dragon spear, preparing to enter.  However, the Nine Phoenix King stopped him.</p>
