Chapter 580: Core Formation Mid-Stage

By now, the white light was but a hair's breadth away.
Its demonic power was useless against the white light.
The Golden Eagle could see two masked figures standing on the mountain peak ahead. Their auras clearly identified them as human, and their cultivation levels were quite low.
A white orb floated before one of them.
The sight of the orb intensified the eagle's sense of foreboding.
Alarmed, the Golden Eagle dared not face the light head-on.  With a powerful flap of its wings, it swerved to the right.
Suddenly, from the corner of its eye, it caught sight of a dark figure appearing on its right.  The figure had a green face, sharp fangs, and a demonic appearance, lunging towards it with terrifying speed.
"Sky Demon!"
The Golden Eagle shrieked, its feathers standing on end.
At its full strength, it wouldn't fear a mere Sky Demon.
However, it was currently injured, and the mysterious white light was about to descend.  In this precarious situation, the appearance of the Sky Demon was deadly.
Without hesitation, the Golden Eagle changed direction again, fleeing to the left.
Just as it was about to evade the white light, it sensed something amiss. Looking down, it saw countless vines emerging from the ground.
*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*
The vines shot up with astonishing speed, ensnaring the Golden Eagle before it could react, forming a cage.
*Bang!*
A loud explosion erupted from within the cage as it bulged, a few vines snapping under the strain.
At this rate, the cage wouldn't hold the Golden Eagle for long.
But then, the white light descended, merging with the cage.  Silence fell instantly.  The vine cage rapidly retracted, disappearing into a dense forest.
Two figures appeared at the edge of the forest.
Yun Youzi looked at the silent forest and smiled. "The ancient restrictions within the forest are quite formidable. It's no exaggeration to say danger lurks at every turn.  The Golden Eagle won't escape anytime soon. Let it struggle with the restrictions. We should go!"
"Senior, you not only deciphered the ancient restrictions but also utilized them to your advantage. I'm deeply impressed!"
Qin Sang had observed the entire battle and was thoroughly awed by Yun Youzi.
He and the Sky Demon had only made brief appearances, never engaging directly.  Yun Youzi had orchestrated the entire ambush.
To effortlessly trap a Core Formation demon with only Foundation Establishment cultivation was a feat few would believe.
Yun Youzi humbly replied, "I merely borrowed and channeled a portion of the ancient restrictions' power. I can't claim to control them."
...
With the Golden Eagle trapped, one threat was eliminated. However, they remained vigilant, focusing on deciphering the restrictions as they drew closer to the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.
A waterfall cascaded down a sheer cliff face like a ribbon of silk.
The line "A stream flies down three thousand feet, as if the Milky Way has fallen from the ninth heaven" perfectly described the scene.
Qin Sang gazed up at the waterfall, sensing the remnants of a former paradise.  He noticed Yun Youzi flying into the waterfall and quickly followed with the Sky Demon.
Beyond the waterfall, the rocks were polished smooth by the water, and the immense force of the falling water made it difficult to stand.
Qin Sang followed Yun Youzi upstream, finally landing on a protruding round rock, barely managing to maintain his footing by channeling his spiritual energy.
Following Yun Youzi's gaze, Qin Sang carefully examined the rocks but found nothing unusual.  He looked at Yun Youzi with confusion.
Yun Youzi urged the Flawless Pearl towards the cliff face, explaining, "There's a hidden realm within the cliff wall.  It was originally protected by ancient restrictions, and the demons added another layer, concealing it further.  Those unaware of its existence wouldn't discover it, even with their divine sense sweeping across the waterfall."
The Flawless Pearl floated before a moss-covered rock, emitting waves of white light that permeated the cliff face.
To Qin Sang's astonishment, the moss-covered rock shimmered, revealing a stone staircase leading into the cliff.
"Let's go."
Yun Youzi entered first.
Inside, the walls glowed with a green fluorescence, perhaps from some strange mineral or a manifestation of the ancient restrictions.
Soon, the sound of gurgling water reached them. There was an underground river within.
Following the river, the space widened.  After a while, a large stone chamber appeared abruptly.  It seemed naturally formed, with no signs of artificial excavation.
The chamber was also the source of the underground river.  The water converged in the center, forming a subterranean lake, making the air damp and cold.
The water was clear and still.
Qin Sang stopped at the entrance of the chamber, his gaze drawn to a spiritual tree on the opposite shore of the lake.
A depression existed on the far shore.
A spiritual tree grew from a crevice in the rock. It wasn't tall, with a sturdy trunk and lush foliage, resembling a plum tree.  Several fruits hung among its branches, hidden within the leaves.
The fruits varied in size, the largest as big as a human fist, the smallest the size of a longan.
The smaller fruits were green and clearly unripe.
The largest fruit was entirely purple, its surface covered in fine, concentric red cloud patterns, giving it a mystical appearance.
A rich fruity fragrance emanated from the fruit, filling the entire chamber.
This was the ripe Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit!
Named for its color and cloud patterns.
This fruit could repair a cultivator's damaged foundation and was even more precious to demons.
Its greatest benefit was its ability to help demons refine their blood essence, purifying their bloodlines and increasing their cultivation speed.
This was why the demons of the Heavenly Demon Hill ventured into the inner palace to compete for this fruit.
However, the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit was only effective for demons below the Core Formation stage, and it grew slowly, with only one or two ripening each time the Violet Palace opened.
This time, only one had ripened.
Consuming the unripe Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit would be pointless, a waste of a precious resource.
He finally found the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit!
His foundation had been damaged since his Foundation Establishment stage, nearly a century ago.
Qin Sang had persevered with his damaged foundation, his journey aided by luck and several rare treasures that mitigated the effects, allowing him to remain as strong as his peers.
He longed to recover fully.
Finally obtaining the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement.
He clenched his fists, nodded to Yun Youzi, and was about to fly across to pick the fruit.
Just then, a mocking voice echoed from behind, "Two mere Foundation Establishment human cultivators dare covet our sacred fruit? I'm curious, how did you learn of the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit's location?"
Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's expressions changed drastically. They spun around.
A black panther emerged from the darkness at the chamber entrance.
The panther moved gracefully and silently.
Its elegant demeanor resembled a human noble, surpassing even the most refined aristocracy.
It was utterly absurd.
Even more astonishing was its undisguised cultivation level.
Core Formation Mid-stage!
