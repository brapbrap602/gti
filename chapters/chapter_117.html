Chapter 110: The Ten Yama Formation


“Kuiyin Patriarch's most famous magical treasure is called the Ten Yama Formation. It uses ten Yama Banners arranged in a formation, possessing unpredictable power. It once terrified righteous cultivators, even Nascent Soul cultivators dared not easily contend with him.
Later, Kuiyin Patriarch, in preparation for his tribulation, had five of the banners destroyed by minor heavenly tribulations. Before his death, he distributed the remaining five Yama Banners to his disciples and passed down a refining method that allowed the creation of similar banners, usable even by cultivators below the Foundation Establishment stage.
Refining this magical tool requires selecting a cultivator, whose cultivation must not exceed the sixth level of Qi Refining.  Before their spirit and body undergo their second transformation, they are tricked into cultivating a specific technique using a Yama Banner.  Soul Pills can help cultivators quickly absorb spiritual energy, making breakthroughs extremely easy. Few possess the willpower of Junior Brother Qin to resist such temptation.
Because refining Yama Banners requires many precious spiritual materials and the refining process is extremely demanding, the Kuiyin Sect has a limited number of banners. So, under the guise of accepting disciples, they lure talented cultivators to the Yin Sha Abyss, which provides ample Yin Sha Qi.
These cultivators believe they'll be accepted as disciples, but are destined to become sacrificial offerings for the refining process.
By cultivating with the Soul Pill, while their cultivation rapidly advances, their spirit is unknowingly and gradually assimilated by the Yama Banner and the Yama King within.  The higher the cultivation, the fiercer the Yama King's backlash.  This is because the connection between the spirit and the Yama King deepens, making resistance increasingly difficult. Only those with exceptional talent and unwavering willpower can suppress the Yama King.
However, upon reaching the tenth level of Qi Refining, even ironclad willpower is useless. Resistance becomes impossible, and the spirit is completely assimilated by the Yama King, merging into one, becoming the main spirit of the Yama Banner.
With a main spirit, a Yama Banner is thus refined.  Few can continuously suppress the Yama King and avoid being consumed.  Therefore, even among Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Kuiyin Sect, not many have collected all ten Yama Banners. Fortunately, six banners are enough to form a rudimentary Ten Yama Formation.
Afterward, by feeding the Yama Banners enough souls and blood sacrifices, their power gradually increases until they all become high-grade magical tools, at which point the Ten Yama Formation's power reaches terrifying levels.
As for how to transform the Yama Banners into true magical treasures, I do not know…"
Qin Sang listened to Sun De's explanation of the Yama Banners' origins, dumbfounded, his heart turning to ice.
He had envied Senior Sister Shi Hong for being chosen by Yue Wu as a disciple, spared from becoming a spy.
Now he realized that Yue Wu valued Shi Hong's talent, seeing her as a likely candidate to help him refine a Yama Banner.
That day in Yue Wu's cave, the elders weren't fighting over disciples, but over a Yama Banner!
With Senior Sister Shi Hong's talent, even as a rogue cultivator without Foundation Establishment Pills, she had a good chance of reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, yet she met such a tragic end.
And the Tan brothers and the other fellow disciples who remained in the Yin Sha Abyss, even if they luckily escaped the Kuiyin Sect's clutches in this incident, they couldn't escape their fate as sacrificial offerings.
Becoming the main spirit of a demonic banner, eternally barred from reincarnation, Qin Sang shuddered at the thought, preferring death by the Yama King's backlash.
If not for the Jade Buddha's protection, he would already be a tool spirit in Sun De's hands. No, he would have been devoured by the Yama King back at the Green Ram Temple.
"Is there a way to cultivate with the Soul Pill and not be assimilated by the Yama King?" Qin Sang asked Sun De.
Sun De replied, "Not that I know of. None of the Kuiyin Sect's direct disciples dare cultivate with the Yama Banner, otherwise, Kuiyin Patriarch would have long led the Kuiyin Sect to dominate the Small Cold Region."
"If someone has already started cultivating with the Yama Banner, how can they avoid being assimilated by the Yama?"
Sun De thought for a moment, then said, "Unless they abolish their entire cultivation and start anew."
Qin Sang smiled bitterly.  It was laughable that he had thought of using the mysterious orchid to gain merit. He was so naive. Returning would be walking right into a trap.
He had initially thought that the Yuanzhao Sect's luring of rogue cultivators to maintain the Eight Trigrams Forbidden Grounds was demonic.




I now realize that compared to the true methods of the Demonic Sect, what I've seen is nothing.
The Corpse Yin Sect has existed for centuries, refining demonic artifacts using their disciples. Countless souls have perished in the Abyss of Yin Sha, and countless others are trapped within the Yama Banners, forever unable to reincarnate.

Qin Sang took a long moment to compose himself before calmly saying, "Senior Brother Sun knows so many secrets, your identity must be extraordinary.  What is your purpose in hiding on Mount Shaohua?"

A look of embarrassment flickered across Sun De's illusory face.  "Junior Brother Qin, please don't misunderstand. Just like you, I only wish to find a safe haven on Mount Shaohua and cultivate in peace.
My father's master was the youngest disciple of Patriarch Corpse Yin, but he failed to reach the Golden Core stage. My father was his only direct disciple, so he held a relatively high position in the Corpse Yin Sect.
Over two decades ago, Old Devil Yi went mad for some unknown reason and suddenly forbade anyone from recruiting disciples from the Abyss of Yin Sha. He was obsessed with attacking the Yuan Zhao Sect.
My father sensed something was amiss. I was still young then, and my father managed to obtain a Sword Intent Decree from Mount Shaohua, secretly sending me here. Now it seems my father was truly prescient. The Corpse Yin Sect was completely destroyed by Old Devil Yi…"

Qin Sang fixed his gaze on Sun De. "Cultivate in peace? I'm afraid there are many falsehoods in Senior Brother's words. Was Fellow Daoist Hong, who died in the Earth Sink Cave a year ago, really just used for refining artifacts with Yin Sha energy?"

Sun De gave a dry laugh. "Junior Brother Qin has a keen eye. Before sending me here, my father left me a few Yama Banners. I did have some ideas, but unfortunately, these rogue cultivators were either lacking in aptitude or too attached to worldly desires; their temperament was unsuitable.  Under the watchful eye of Mount Shaohua, I didn't dare to be too blatant. Even now, I haven't lured many people, and I haven't been able to refine a single Ten Directions Yama Banner. As for that wretch Hong Shan, I warned him to wait for a few years, until after Junior Brother left the Earth Sink Cave, but he dared to disobey my orders, so I had to…"

Qin Sang sneered. "You wanted me to become the main soul of the Yama Banner, didn't you?  Unfortunately, I've disappointed Senior Brother."

Sun De chuckled awkwardly, not daring to reply.

Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. "Senior Brother Sun hasn't told me how to remove the Heart-Devouring Insect."

He had just questioned Sun De thoroughly. As long as a Corpse Yin Sect member had learned the Poisonous Gu technique created by Patriarch Corpse Yin, they would immediately sense anyone infected with the Heart-Devouring Insect who entered their spiritual sense range.
At his current cultivation level, his spiritual sense could only reach a few meters around him. However, for Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators, their spiritual sense range was terrifying. If he were to encounter any remnants of the Corpse Yin Sect, he would have no way to escape, which posed a significant threat.
