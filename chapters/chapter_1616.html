<h1>Chapter 1607:  A Figure in the Distance</h1><p>Chapter 1607:  A Figure in the Distance</p><p>“What’s this?”</p><p>Qin Sang followed Jiang You into the inner hall of the residence.  There, he saw a human-sized wooden frame with a large bronze gong hanging from the crossbeams.</p><p>This gong had three faces.</p><p>Without anyone touching it, the gong swung gently, emitting a faint yellow glow.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, sensing the energy of a nearby spirit formation drawing power into the gong.</p><p>“This treasure is called the Seven-Sound Gong. It’s a unique Buddhist artifact. The hall master acquired it at a great cost after the incident at the last exchange,”</p><p>Jiang You drew a ‘卍’ character in mid-air and flicked it towards the gong.  It vanished into the yellow light. The gong hummed, suddenly ceasing its swaying motion, its glow fading, but its connection to the spirit formation becoming even more subtle.</p><p>“A corresponding array has been set up nearby. This treasure is extremely sensitive to energy fluctuations.  It’s to prevent anyone with malicious intent from attending the auction or the exchange, especially those with demonic energy.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood, secretly thinking that the Six States Hall was understandably wary after its previous experience.</p><p>The last time demonic creatures infiltrated the exchange, the Six States Hall had suffered a significant loss of face.  Another such incident would be truly embarrassing.</p><p>Qin Sang was not involved in the hall's daily affairs. His only duty was to appear at the auctions and exchanges.</p><p>After seeing Jiang You off, Qin Sang stayed in his cave for a while before leaving the Six States Hall branch and wandering aimlessly through Hong City.</p><p>The grand auction was scheduled for the morning of the day after tomorrow, divided into Golden Core and Nascent Soul stages.  Auctions for lower-level cultivators had already started several days ago in the south city, with unlimited sessions.</p><p>All Nascent Soul cultivators in Hong City had received invitations, including Qin Sang.</p><p>The list of items to be auctioned had yet to be released, but the boldness of the Golden Jade Gate had everyone in high anticipation.</p><p>Hong City was overflowing with people.</p><p>Unknowingly, Qin Sang found himself at the main peak.</p><p>Within a short time, he encountered several Nascent Soul masters, figures rarely seen, along with a few others whose auras suggested they were at the mid-Nascent Soul stage or higher.</p><p>Hong City was a den of hidden dragons and tigers.  Carelessly using spiritual sense to investigate could easily lead to misunderstandings.</p><p>Qin Sang simply enjoyed the view, avoiding contact with anyone, walking slowly to the summit of the main peak.</p><p>The main peak was the center of the Jiangbei mountains, overlooking countless mountains to the west and the vast ocean to the east.</p><p>A nine-story tower, resplendent with gold and jade, stood proudly on the summit, a stark contrast to its surroundings; this was the Golden Jade Tower.</p><p>Undeniably, the Golden Jade Tower belonged to the Golden Jade Gate, and the grand auction would be held there.</p><p>Qin Sang had little contact with the Golden Jade Gate, but from past rumors and his own observations, he felt it was unlike a typical immortal sect, even more ostentatious than the Six States Hall.</p><p>Perhaps the Golden Jade Gate's heritage was unique.</p><p>Cultivation methods could alter a cultivator's personality, thereby influencing the atmosphere of a sect.</p><p>As Qin Sang passed by the Golden Jade Tower, he glanced at it without intending to enter. As he turned to leave, his brow furrowed imperceptibly.</p><p>He seemed to have felt a scrutinizing gaze upon him.</p><p>Qin Sang’s spiritual sense had greatly improved, and his intuition was sharp. He knew it was not a hallucination. This gaze was different from others; the person was paying close attention to him!</p><p>He quickly memorized the surroundings of the Golden Jade Tower.</p><p>To the right of the Golden Jade Tower…</p><p>A Nascent Soul female cultivator was walking towards him, arm in arm with a handsome young man.</p><p>The young man was only at the mid-Golden Core stage, seemingly unaware of the female cultivator's true cultivation level. His behavior was frivolous and casual, and the female cultivator seemed to enjoy it, her gaze filled with admiration.</p><p>Qin Sang could detect a chilling coldness in the female cultivator's eyes, recalling rumors about the Futian Valley of the Demon Sect. If the young man didn't wake up soon, his end would likely be grim.</p><p>A Taoist priest emerged from the Golden Jade Tower. His attire suggested he was a master from the Quiet Zen Villa. He glanced at the female cultivator, but said nothing, his movements erratic as he melted into the crowd.</p><p>Two steps down, a Nascent Soul couple were whispering intimately.</p><p>…</p><p>One by one, the images of the cultivators flickered through Qin Sang's mind as he eliminated them.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly was also silently using its abilities.</p><p>Everything seemed normal!</p><p>“A hallucination?”</p><p>Qin Sang refused to believe his intuition was wrong, but the person had truly vanished, or their disguise was too perfect for him to see through.</p><p>Maintaining his pace, he calmly walked past the Golden Jade Tower, toured the other peaks, and returned to the Six States Hall residence by nightfall. The feeling hadn't returned.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped thinking about it and began sorting through his storage ring.</p><p>He only had one stick of Spirit-Subduing Incense left. The two crocodile corpses should fetch a good price. He could also sell the formula for the Spirit-Subduing Incense, but he wanted to save it for a more important occasion.</p><p>According to his observations, even in the wealthy Central Plains, gathering all the spiritual materials needed for the Spirit-Calming Incense was incredibly difficult.  Few could afford the ingredients and possess the skill to refine it.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to gather the rarest ingredients first when he had the time, before considering selling the formula.</p><p>The moon hung like a silken veil.  Qin Sang looked out at the quiet courtyard, lost in thought.  Suddenly, a gong shattered the stillness!</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>Three bronze gongs sounded in unison.  Their clear resonance echoed throughout the entire outpost.  The Seven-Note Gong!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. He instantly rose and appeared above the courtyard.  Simultaneously, figures surged from all directions. The Six States Hall's experts were roused, their gazes fixed on the hall's rear chamber.</p><p>That was where the Six States Hall's treasury was located, guarded personally by Deputy Hall Master Jiang You!</p><p>A golden light soared from the rear chamber, accompanied by the urgent clang of gongs.  A white figure flickered silently within the golden light, graceful as a crane, ghostlike in its movements.</p><p>From the rear chamber came Deputy Hall Master Jiang You's furious roar, "Stop him!"</p><p>Simultaneously, panicked shouts arose from within.</p><p>"No! The Sky Vault has been opened!"</p><p>"The restrictions have been broken…"</p><p>…</p><p>The Sky Vault, the Six States Hall's most important treasury, had been silently infiltrated. Only the Seven-Note Gong's alarm revealed the theft.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The white figure's movements were extraordinarily subtle.  In a flash, they vanished into the void beyond the mountain.</p><p>Jiang You only then burst from the rear chamber, his robes torn, his body laced with thin, transparent threads, clearly hampered by the opponent's abilities.  Enraged, seeing the white figure escape, he looked towards Qin Sang's residence. Finding it empty, he breathed a sigh of relief and ordered, "Quickly pursue! Go assist Elder Qin!"</p><p>Leaving most of his men, including Jiang Mu, to guard the treasury, Jiang You led the others in pursuit.</p><p>The commotion alerted nearby cultivators; some followed secretly.  Golden Jade Sect patrol cultivators also noticed the disturbance. They activated jade talismans to contact their sect's experts and spurred their spirit beasts towards the scene.</p><p>In the lead, the white figure's escape technique, though refined, was no match for Qin Sang.  Shortly after leaving Hong City, Qin Sang caught up.</p><p>"Where do you think you're going!"</p><p>Qin Sang bellowed.</p><p>A sword arc leaped from the Qianjun Ring. The Jinchen Sword, swift as a meteor, unleashed a thousand-zhang blade of light, a river of sword energy cleaving the air.</p><p>The white figure seemed to glance back at Qin Sang, then faced the descending sword light, sweeping their sleeve. Without deploying any apparent weapon, a violent wind arose, forming visible grey gusts that coalesced into a monstrous gale, sweeping across the sky.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The river of sword energy relentlessly cut through the gale, like a burning brand, breaking through with unstoppable force, flashing brilliantly within the swirling wind.  The gale churned, its grey gusts wildly attacking the sword light, forming tangible chains that wrapped around it, layer upon layer.</p><p>"Late Yuan Ying stage!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, confirming the opponent's cultivation.</p><p>While the Six States Hall treasury contained many treasures, items worthy of a Grand Cultivator's attention wouldn't be stored there. For a Grand Cultivator to deign to steal such relatively minor treasures, only to be caught red-handed, seemed nonsensical.</p><p>"The treasures I brought to Hong City were intended for auction. If you desire any, simply ask, and I'll gladly gift them to you. Why go to such lengths?"</p><p>Qin Sang called out loudly.  A few treasures were a small price to pay for befriending a Grand Cultivator; he believed Hall Master Mu had the foresight to understand this.</p><p>"What I want, I take!"</p><p>The white figure scoffed.  Their laughter was distorted, as Qin Sang, seeing the sword light fail to stop them, altered his sword technique. The Jinchen Sword vanished, plunging the void into darkness, engulfing the gale.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Array unleashed, the gale, now directionless, thrashed wildly within the sword formation, its power collapsing under the relentless assault of the sword threads, dissolving piece by piece.</p><p>The sword threads flashed, instantly obliterating the last wisp of the gale, enveloping the space before the white figure could escape.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced behind him.  The disturbance had been rather significant.  Besides Jiang You and his men, numerous figures were rapidly approaching, illuminating the night sky outside Hong City, far behind the two of them.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed several golden streams of light, the speed indicating Golden Jade Sect's unique escape techniques. He nodded silently, waiting for their arrival. With trouble in Hong City, Golden Jade Sect had an obligation to act.</p><p>Qin Sang acted only as a guest elder should. He wasn't going to fight to the death for the Six States Hall and a Grand Cultivator. Delaying the opponent and waiting for reinforcements was already more than enough.</p><p>Besides, Qin Sang recalled the feeling of being watched that day.</p><p>That night, a Grand Cultivator infiltrated the Six States Hall.</p><p>Coincidence?</p><p>Qin Sang ordered his Sky-Eye Butterflies to secretly guard the surroundings, but for now, they found nothing unusual.</p><p>"Your sword formation isn't bad, but you use it terribly! Your swordsmanship is amateurish!"</p><p>Trapped in the sword formation, the white figure showed no sign of panic. Instead, they sneered and taunted.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond,</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh!' piercing sounds echoed from the sword formation.  Transparent threads shot out from the white figure, identical to those used against Jiang You.</p><p>The white figure clearly hadn't used their full strength against Jiang You.</p><p>The threads wove a wondrous scene around the white figure. Countless threads intertwined, forming a lake suspended in mid-air.</p><p>The lake water was crystal clear, just like a real lake.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>The surface of the water bulged, and a water giant emerged, its empty eyes fixed on the countless sword threads. It roared, raised its arms, twisted its body, and smashed its fist into the sword formation!</p><p>The force of the blow was thunderous.</p><p>Instantly, the sword formation shook violently.</p><p>Qin Sang's face grew serious. He quickly chanted an incantation, the sword threads frantically retracting, compressing the power of the formation to repair the breach.</p><p>But the white figure had seized the opportunity, appearing above the water giant, charging upwards.  Facing the converging sword threads, they calmly pointed to another part of the sword formation, saying softly, "This formation should be mine."</p><p>That was the spot hit by the water giant, where the sword formation's power hadn't recovered, the threads in disarray.</p><p>At these words,</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked to discover that the sword threads were completely out of his control, severed from their connection.  Though not the entire formation, only that area, it was a fatal flaw.</p><p>Even more astonishing, the white figure flicked a finger, and those sword threads were now controlled by them, turning against their 'companions'.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation was torn apart, the sword threads fighting each other.</p><p>The white figure watched calmly.</p><p>"Full of flaws!"</p><p>The white figure's scornful laughter reached Qin Sang's ears.</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless, unable to refute.</p><p>After the sword formation was completed, trapped enemies had always only been able to defend. This was the first time it was broken by such a bizarre method.</p><p>The water giant was understandable, but Qin Sang couldn't comprehend the white figure's final technique.</p><p>Unheard of!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The white figure burst free from the sword formation, unharmed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, they didn't flee, turning to face Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang froze, sensing something was wrong.  He quickly used his phoenix wings to teleport thousands of feet away.</p><p>The moment he left, the white figure appeared in his former spot.</p><p>Qin Sang had experienced this with the green-haired rat demon, but the white figure's movements were far more subtle and effortless, impossible to guard against.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>The water giant roared,</p><p>punch after punch shattering the sword threads, its strength incredible.</p><p>The white figure could only control the threads briefly.</p><p>Qin Sang forcefully regained control of the sword formation, trapping the water giant, then focused on the white figure. The black lotus on his forehead glowed, and the Infernal Flame Dragon reappeared, charging directly at the void to his left.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The void rippled slightly, revealing the white figure's shadow, which shattered like a mirror under the Infernal Flame's assault, then swept away, utterly annihilated.</p><p>The white figure repeated their tactic, only to be used against them.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's face wasn't joyful. The white figure's abilities were too strange; they couldn't be so easily killed.</p><p>He remained vigilant, scanning his surroundings.</p><p>The next moment, a nearby hill trembled, a huge footprint appearing out of thin air. The white figure materialized above the footprint, their figure swaying slightly as they drifted back several feet, landing steadily, robes billowing.</p><p>They had used some technique to absorb the Infernal Flame's impact.</p><p>The hill suffered; the top stones were crushed by the footprint, the entire hill splitting from the footprint's center, fissures going all the way to the bottom, springs gushing forth.</p><p>Their two exchanges happened in a flash.  Neither seemed to gain the upper hand, but Qin Sang knew how dangerous the opponent was. He had been forced to use the Infernal Flame and could only defend, making him want to retreat.</p><p>The white figure paused, glancing back.</p><p>Reinforcements were arriving.</p><p>They seemed unwilling to continue fighting Qin Sang, ceasing their attack, raising a hand in a gesture. The water giant, still battling the sword formation, stiffened, melting into a puddle of water.</p><p>Then, the light on the white figure's face flickered, their features gradually clearing, revealing a woman in court robes.</p><p>The beautiful woman examined Qin Sang, staring at the jade pendant on his waist.</p><p>"Some skill. No wonder you could pass through the storm and come from the North Sea."</p>
