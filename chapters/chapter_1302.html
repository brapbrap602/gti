<h1>Chapter 1294: Awakening</h1><p>Chapter 1294: Awakening</p><p>In the quiet chamber, Ya Gu lay still, her eyes closed, like a sleeping beauty.  Her cheeks were rosy, but beneath the surface, a faint deathly aura lingered, despite the life force that had been slowly returning before her collapse.  Now, she was like a statue, radiating only stillness.</p><p>Fei Can was asleep within Ya Gu.  After returning to Xiaohan Region, Qin Sang had tried several times to awaken Fei Can, without success.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai sat cross-legged.  After a moment of silence, Bai opened his eyes and nodded.  “Remarkable. This girl’s will is even stronger than I anticipated. She’s been fighting, never giving up, her consciousness never succumbing to the darkness.”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang recalled Ya Gu’s life. From birth, she had been enveloped in darkness. His appearance had brought a glimmer of light, but also a greater catastrophe.  She had stumbled through the darkness, never abandoning her yearning for light. Perhaps those experiences forged her resilient spirit.  Those who save themselves are saved by heaven.</p><p>Because Ya Gu continued to fight, Qin Sang's actions held even greater meaning; they weren't solely for fulfilling his own beliefs.</p><p>Bai then handed Qin Sang a jade slip. “This contains a carefully selected portion of a bone incantation, the gentlest part, the limit of what she can endure.”</p><p>Qin Sang took the jade slip, surprised. “I’m to do this?”</p><p>“Who else?” Bai snorted. “The Heavenly Corpse Talisman within her is your handiwork. You are, in a sense, her master.  Inscribing the bone incantation, manipulating the Heavenly Corpse Talisman’s power—it requires precision, any mistake will harm her soul.  Naturally, it must be you. Don’t worry, I’ve detailed the incantation method, and I’ll assist you.”</p><p>Qin Sang explored the jade slip with his spiritual sense.  He first saw a bone incantation that seemed familiar.  It was similar to the one inscribed on the white bone arm, but with modifications made by Bai to ensure Ya Gu could withstand its power.  The incantation method was also Bai’s own creation.</p><p>This skill alone filled Qin Sang with admiration.  Truly a remarkable ancient being surviving to the present day. The incantation wasn’t complicated, and Qin Sang quickly understood it.</p><p>An hour later, the two sat on either side of Ya Gu.  Qin Sang nodded to Bai, his gaze falling on Ya Gu’s left arm. Although she bore the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, the corpse energy was suppressed by the San Guang Jade Liquid’s life force, preventing her body from decaying.  During their time in Canglang Sea, each time Qin Sang used the San Guang Jade Liquid to replenish his true essence, he transferred life force to Ya Gu. Even after decades, her inner vitality remained vibrant.</p><p>Her delicate arm bore beautiful markings, the sacred tattoos of the Witch Clan.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then probed Ya Gu’s arm with his spiritual sense. After a careful examination, he suddenly raised his hands, his fingers moving swiftly, forming a spell seal in an instant.</p><p>He didn’t stop there.  Within the chamber, spiritual energy surged, strange runes flowing from Qin Sang’s fingertips, sinking into Ya Gu’s body.</p><p>Ya Gu’s appearance remained unchanged.  But on her arm bone, golden runes began to appear, tiny as ants, densely packed. Under their glow, her arm bone seemed to transform into gold.</p><p>Bai also worked alongside Qin Sang, stabilizing the bone incantation. Seeing the runes smoothly entering Ya Gu's body, Bai's eyes showed a flicker of surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang, multitasking, sensed both the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the bone incantation.  As Bai had said, there was a strange connection between them, allowing him to use the bone incantation to control the Heavenly Corpse Talisman’s power and lessen its effects on Ya Gu.</p><p>“No matter what you feel, don’t resist,” Qin Sang whispered, uncertain if she could hear him.</p><p>He then swiftly changed his hand seals, completing the final ritual.  Bai, seeing this, focused all his attention on assisting Qin Sang.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang let out a low shout, forming an incredibly complex hand seal, and pressed down forcefully with both hands. One hand firmly grasped Ya Gu's arm, the other pressed against her forehead.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Golden light erupted. Ya Gu’s body trembled.  After a moment, the golden light faded. Qin Sang and Bai exchanged a look and quickly turned their attention to Ya Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a faint fluctuation from Ya Gu, incredibly subtle, yet undeniably auspicious—her soul was reviving! Bai's method had worked!</p><p>"Unexpectedly, this girl seems quite compatible with the bone curse. Her resilience surpasses my expectations," Bai exclaimed in amazement.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, recalling the remarkably smooth process of the incantation. "It's probably due to the San Guang Jade Liquid.  Her body was constantly nourished by life energy, which must have been incredibly beneficial."</p><p>"Possible," Bai nodded. "Perhaps it's also related to the fat silkworm. But it's not a bad thing. Once she stabilizes, we'll observe for a while and then try more complex bone curses. The effects will be better."</p><p>While they conversed, subtle changes occurred within Ya Gu.</p><p>An incense stick later…</p><p>Under their watchful eyes, a faint iridescent glow appeared on Ya Gu's forehead.</p><p>"It's the fat silkworm!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up as she intently watched her forehead.</p><p>The glow intensified, then suddenly pulsed, and a short, stout figure shot out, about to land in Qin Sang's arms, but she caught it.</p><p>The fat silkworm was finally awake!</p><p>Despite decades of slumber and no food or water, it remained plump, though its skin seemed firmer.</p><p>'Chirp… chirp…’</p><p>The silkworm conveyed affection, rubbing against Qin Sang's palm, its small eyes brimming with grievance and on the verge of tears, pitifully adorable.</p><p>However, Qin Sang, long familiar with its nature, saw through its ploy.  The creature was clearly starving.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang remain unmoved, it began to roll around, seemingly accusing her of its starvation!</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled inwardly and took out a Toxic Algae fruit from her Qian Jun ring.</p><p>At the sight of the enticing food, the silkworm's eyes gleamed, and it lunged forward, swallowing the fruit in one gulp.</p><p>One fruit clearly wasn't enough.</p><p>Worried about its digestion of the potent poison, Qin Sang produced other food, which the silkworm devoured without hesitation, like a famished ghost.</p><p>Ignoring the gluttonous silkworm, Qin Sang turned her attention to Ya Gu. The silkworm was her anchor in the real world. After its awakening, Ya Gu's condition stabilized further, and Qin Sang sensed faint emotional fluctuations.</p><p>With its belly full, the silkworm rolled over, languidly resting in Qin Sang's palm. Then, it transformed into an iridescent glow and flew back into Ya Gu's forehead.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and quickly probed Ya Gu's spirit sea with her spiritual sense. She discovered the silkworm nestled against Ya Gu's spirit, fast asleep.</p><p>This time, however, it was different.</p><p>The silkworm wasn't deeply asleep but, as before, digested its meal while sleeping.  Qin Sang could awaken it anytime she wished.</p>
