<h1>Chapter 1642: The Heavenly Exquisite Orb</h1><p>The medicinal garden was a matter for later.</p><p>The strange-faced man's legacy was the true prize of this venture.</p><p>A cursory glance revealed many items that greatly stirred Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved some True Essence Replenishing Pills and shared them with his Avatar, restoring their True Essence as he took out the strange-faced man's Mustard Seed Bag and began to examine it carefully.</p><p>The bag contained surprisingly few magical treasures, spirit pills, talismans, and other such external objects, far fewer than befitted the man's cultivation level.</p><p>For many years, the strange-faced man had devoted himself to nurturing the Gu King, refining his poison skills, and suppressing the raging poison within his body.</p><p>Later, with the Gu King matured, the acquisition of the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree, and his cultivation of the Acquired Wooden Figure Stele in preparation for opening the Legacy of the Formless Immortal Sect, he had no spare energy for anything else.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense stirred the Mustard Seed Bag, sending several streaks of light flying out.</p><p>He reached out and grasped a wooden box.</p><p>Opening it revealed a mass of azure light.  His divine sense swept over it, and the refining method for the Heavenly Exquisite Orb imprinted itself upon Qin Sang's sea of consciousness. This secret art of the Wood Aspect Hall was finally his.</p><p>The refining method was complete, even containing insights left by past Hall Masters of the Wood Aspect Hall.</p><p>Seeing it with his own eyes, Qin Sang realized refining the Heavenly Exquisite Orb was not as easy as the strange-faced man had made it sound.</p><p>The refiner must first possess profound skill in the Dao of Artifact Refinement and have a cultivation no lower than late Nascent Soul.</p><p>This treasure aided in reaching Deity Transformation, its value immeasurable.</p><p>However, anyone seeking to refine the Heavenly Exquisite Orb for trade would still need to weigh the costs and benefits carefully, a testament to the difficulty of its creation.</p><p>Refining the Heavenly Exquisite Orb was not a task that could be accomplished overnight. The required spirit materials were all exceptionally rare heavenly treasures. Even Qin Sang, a master artifact refiner, didn't recognize several of them.</p><p>The other streaks of light contained jade slips, some of which held the Wood Aspect Hall's artifact refinement legacy.</p><p>During the Formless Immortal Sect's golden age, the Wood Aspect Hall had been renowned for its artifact refinement.  This inheritance would undoubtedly be of great help to Qin Sang, allowing him to make rapid progress in his artifact refinement skills once he could devote his attention to it. This was an unexpected boon.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the legacies of both the Pill and Artifact Refinement Halls of the Formless Immortal Sect had fallen into his hands.</p><p>Combining the knowledge within the jade slips, Qin Sang found records of those unfamiliar spirit materials.  Some could be found with diligent searching, while others could only be obtained through luck.</p><p>Especially a spiritual substance called Lunar Laurel Celestial Dew, the rarest of all, produced within the Celestial Cinnamon Secret Realm of the Heavenly Harmony Hall, accessible only once every few centuries.</p><p>The strange-faced man hadn't been able to find Lunar Laurel Celestial Dew within the Wood Aspect Hall.</p><p>Now that the Immortal Halls had ascended, the Celestial Cinnamon Secret Realm was inaccessible. Where could he find it?</p><p>The refining method for the Heavenly Exquisite Orb didn't contain this information, deliberately erased by the strange-faced man. Otherwise, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master wouldn't have been so optimistic.</p><p>Of course, there were exceptions.  A Nascent Soul cultivator from the Formless Immortal Sect, while traveling through the outer regions of the Storm Belt, had stumbled upon an ancient cultivator's legacy and obtained a small vial.</p><p>It might still exist somewhere in this world, hidden within some unknown ancient cultivator's legacy.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed five elemental spirit roots, rendering the Heavenly Exquisite Orb useless to him.  Yet, seeing this, he couldn't help but feel a tinge of disappointment.  Without the necessary spirit materials, the value of this secret art was greatly diminished.  He would need to carefully consider how to maximize its benefits.</p><p>The strange-faced man hadn't only concealed this information from the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to the last streak of light and gently beckoned it.</p><p>In his hand was a crystal-clear jade sphere, the size of a baby's fist, radiating a pure emerald light, shimmering like a night pearl.</p><p>This jade sphere was the Heavenly Exquisite Orb!</p><p>However, it was an unfinished embryonic form.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze, his sight penetrating the emerald light to see flaws within the jade.</p><p>The surface wasn't smooth, but riddled with countless tiny voids, so small they were imperceptible without careful examination.</p><p>Each void was inscribed with countless restrictions, their complexity unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen. Few treasures in this world could compare, and this was only the orb's first layer.</p><p>The Heavenly Exquisite Orb could be seen as five nested jade spheres.</p><p>All five layers possessed a similar level of intricate detail.</p><p>When the Heavenly Exquisite Orb was complete, the five layers had to be fused into one, their energies balanced without conflict, maintained in a specific equilibrium.</p><p>Closer observation revealed that the Heavenly Exquisite Orb wasn't entirely solid, existing somewhere between reality and illusion, capable of fusing with any type of natal magical treasure.</p><p>The Wood Aspect Hall Master of that era had refined the embryonic form and placed it in the artifact chamber, nurturing it with the Wood Aspect Hall's unique artifact refinement spirit array.  Later, when the great war erupted and the Hall Master fell, this treasure remained within the Wood Aspect Hall, gathering dust, unknown to anyone.</p><p>Upon discovering this treasure, the strange-faced man had been ecstatic.  Although the embryonic form was far from complete, at least he no longer needed to worry about the Lunar Laurel Celestial Dew.</p><p>Even if he had found several, he wouldn't have easily given them to the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>The Wood Aspect Hall's artifact refinement legacy and the embryonic Heavenly Exquisite Orb alone were worth the cost of a Boiling Snow Pill, and Qin Sang had paid practically no price.</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly praised his luck, carefully storing away the treasures.  He stirred the Mustard Seed Bag again, and three more clusters of radiant light flew out.</p><p>A token, a wooden armor, and a broken tree.</p><p>The token was the Wood Aspect Token.</p><p>From searching the Weeping Spirit Cave Master's soul, Qin Sang knew the Five Aspect Tokens seemed to play a significant role in Emperor Bestowal Mountain.  He didn't understand the specifics, so he put it away for now, waiting to see its effects later.</p><p>The wooden armor, frozen by Glacial Soul Divine Light, had fallen into Qin Sang's hands after the strange-faced man's death.</p><p>This was undoubtedly a powerful defensive treasure, but it needed to be cleansed of the strange-faced man's aura and meticulously refined before he could use it.  He placed it aside with the broken tree.</p><p>The broken tree was the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree.</p><p>When the strange-faced man self-destructed his spirit wood body, the tree disintegrated, but its essence remained, and a portion survived. However, the tree had been refined by the strange-faced man using secret arts for many years, tainted with his aura. It could only be used for artifact refinement now.</p><p>Qin Sang was more interested in the strange-faced man's divine abilities, his Spirit Wood Body and poison needles.</p><p>He continued searching and finally pulled out a piece of withered wood from the Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>The withered wood was less than a foot long and as thick as a wrist, completely black, clearly a thoroughly rotted piece of deadwood.  Even his divine sense detected nothing unusual.</p><p>Anywhere else, Qin Sang wouldn't have given it a second glance.</p><p>Only when his divine sense carefully probed, touching the faintest glimmer at the withered wood's core, did he realize it held something more!</p><p>Recorded within the withered wood were several legacies of the Wood Aspect Hall, seemingly left by descendants.</p><p>These legacies included the strange-faced man's fundamental cultivation method, the *Wood Emperor Canon*, and its corresponding divine abilities, including the *Acquired Wooden Figure Stele* that Qin Sang had been thinking about!</p><p>Cultivating these divine abilities required finding spirit wood to refine into a Spirit Wood Body, granting immense strength, comparable to a body cultivator, just like the strange-faced man.</p><p>Within a forest rich with wood spirit energy, one could become like a divine stele, rooted to the earth, connected to all the trees, absorbing wood spirit energy for an all-around enhancement, significantly boosting both strength and recovery.</p><p>Qin Sang now understood why the transformed strange-faced man had been so difficult to deal with.</p><p>And the strange-faced man had only achieved minor completion of the divine ability.  Upon major completion, there were many more incredible powers, though it was difficult to reach that level in the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>Moreover, the enhancements from the Acquired Wooden Figure Stele were also related to the quality of the spirit wood.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at his Avatar.</p><p>Back then, the Dao Manifestation Tree had enabled the White Transformation. Was there any spirit tree of higher rank than the Dao Manifestation Tree?</p><p>However, refining the Dao Manifestation Tree into a Spirit Wood Body and integrating it into himself would require restoring the Dao Manifestation Tree to its original form and abandoning his External Avatar. This was a difficult choice.</p><p>The *Acquired Wooden Figure Stele* held great potential, enhancing his own body. But his External Avatar had the ability to die and be reborn, and he had already invested a tremendous amount of energy and resources into it.</p><p>Refining a Spirit Wood Body was no simple task either.</p><p>His External Avatar was about to break through to late Nascent Soul, its potential not necessarily inferior to a Spirit Wood Body. The ability to die and be reborn was a powerful divine ability he couldn't easily abandon.</p><p>Even with his late Nascent Soul cultivation, Qin Sang didn't dare claim invincibility.</p><p>With a sigh, he put aside these troubling thoughts for now and stored the withered wood, retrieving another jade slip.</p><p>This jade slip contained the *Gu Canon* of the Myriad Poison Mountain, moreover, the complete version.</p><p>The latter half of the *Gu Canon* didn't record the method for nurturing the Gu King, but the descriptions indicated the Gu King and the *Gu Canon* shared a common origin.</p><p>The Gu King must have been a core secret of the Myriad Poison Mountain.  Qin Sang didn't know how the strange-faced man had gotten his hands on it and managed to steal a portion of the Myriad Poison Mountain's legacy.</p><p>No wonder the Myriad Poison Mountain hated him so much.</p><p>Recorded at the end of the *Gu Canon* were several poison-based divine abilities, with the *Heaven Severing Soul Shattering Divine Needle* being the most powerful.</p><p>Its name, meaning "With one needle, sever the heavens and shatter the souls of all living beings and ghosts," was incredibly imposing, and its power lived up to its name.</p><p>Cultivating this divine ability required using a potent poison as a catalyst.  But refining the potent poison required caution, as rushing the process could lead to the poison invading one's internal organs, resulting in death before mastering the poison skill.</p><p>The strange-faced man had undoubtedly used the Gu King to cultivate this divine ability.</p><p>Qin Sang looked away from the *Gu Canon* and towards the Demonic Fire floating within the cave dwelling, a contemplative expression on his face.</p><p>After devouring its master, the crimson color on the Gu King was gradually fading, returning to its original jade-white hue.  But its ferocious nature hadn't diminished; instead, it seemed to be intensifying.</p><p>He didn't know how to subdue the Gu King and had been using the Demonic Fire to imprison it.  Even after reviewing the *Gu Canon* and the strange-faced man's treasures, he hadn't found a solution.</p><p>Then, a thought struck him, and he understood.</p><p>The Myriad Poison Mountain had likely shared that information with him, confident that even if he killed the strange-faced man, he wouldn't be able to subdue the Gu King and would have to trade with them.</p><p>The Gu King's poisonous light was extraordinary, and its inherent rank was extremely high, its value immeasurable.</p><p>“What will the Myriad Poison Mountain offer in exchange?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, but didn't hold high expectations.</p><p>If possible, he preferred to subdue the Gu King himself and control this powerful weapon. At least he would wait until he had consulted with Ghost Mother before considering a trade.</p><p>But he needed to enter Emperor Bestowal Mountain; this wasn't a long-term solution.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Gu King for a moment, then a thought flickered in his mind.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's poison pearl could counteract the Heaven Severing Soul Shattering Divine Needle. Could he use the poison pearl to suppress the Gu King's ferocity?  It would be enough to keep it obedient during his time in the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>He immediately put his thought into action.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his mind on his Qi Sea, stirring the poison pearl.</p><p>Seven-colored light burst forth from his dantian as the poison pearl slowly flew out, drifting towards the Gu King.</p><p>Sensing the poison pearl's aura, the Gu King's buzzing wings abruptly stopped. It turned, its blood-red eyes fixated on the poison pearl as if facing a formidable foe, then emitted even more rapid and sharp buzzing sounds.</p><p>"A reaction is good…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up.  After a moment's thought, he directed the poison pearl through the Demonic Fire, placing it before the Gu King.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A streak of poisonous light shot out instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang, not wanting to be too careless, controlled the poison pearl to dodge, allowing only the edge of the poisonous light to graze it.</p><p>Suddenly, the poison pearl transformed into a multicolored mist, and the poisonous light passed harmlessly through.</p><p>Then, the poison pearl re-formed, completely unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it, relieved, and steered the poison pearl towards the Gu King.</p><p>The Gu King's wings buzzed frantically, spraying poisonous light everywhere, but it couldn't hit Qin Sang or destroy the poison pearl. Instead, the Demonic Fire gradually constricted its movement, allowing the poison pearl to close in.</p><p>Soon, the poison pearl hovered directly above the Gu King's head.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The poison pearl transformed into a multicolored mist of purifying light, seemingly about to swallow the Gu King.</p><p>In the next moment, the Gu King was enveloped by the multicolored mist, the faint outline of the pearl still visible.</p><p>However, after approaching the Gu King a certain distance, the multicolored mist couldn't advance further.  The Gu King spread its wings, its body emitting a faint crimson glow, forming a protective poisonous light, and flashed out of the multicolored mist.</p><p>Despite the failed attempt, Qin Sang wasn't discouraged.  Instead, he appeared surprised, as if he had discovered something unexpected.</p><p>He continued controlling the poison pearl, repeating the process.</p><p>After dozens of attempts, all ended in failure.</p><p>But the strange look in Qin Sang's eyes intensified.  He had made a startling discovery.</p><p>Every time the poison pearl enveloped the Gu King, Qin Sang felt a sensation, as if the poison pearl intensely craved the Gu King, intending to devour it!</p><p>After so many attempts, Qin Sang was certain this wasn't an illusion.</p><p>He remembered that after the Fat Silkworm's fourth transformation, it could directly devour Gu insects. He had even bred some for it to feast upon, and the Gu King's cultivation method was similar to those Gu insects.</p><p>The poison pearl extracted from it had inherited this devouring ability!</p><p>"If the poison pearl devours the Gu King, could it further enhance itself?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed with excitement at this possibility.</p><p>The poison-purifying divine ability had limited applications, but when used, it could be incredibly effective.</p><p>Qin Sang always believed that external objects were inferior to one's own power. The poison pearl was closely connected to him, a part of him. If the poison pearl continuously devoured poisonous substances, what kind of transformation would occur in the future?</p><p>The Gu King's intelligence was low, and its potential was clearly inferior to the poison pearl.</p><p>The problem was that the poison pearl couldn't suppress the Gu King. How could he make the Gu King willingly be devoured?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, recalling various scriptures and studying the *Gu Canon* further.  Even as his True Essence neared full restoration and it was time to leave, he hadn't found a solution.</p><p>Suddenly, inspiration struck, and he clapped his hands.</p><p>Since insect control methods wouldn't work, why not start with its master?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what methods the strange-faced man used to suppress the Gu King. But he knew the strange-faced man's fundamental cultivation method was the *Wood Emperor Canon*, attuned to the Wood Dao.</p><p>The Gu King had always been by the strange-faced man's side and might fear this aura.</p><p>However, before having his Avatar attempt this, Qin Sang withdrew his mind from his Qi Sea and returned to his original spirit.</p><p>Since merging with Cloud Wanderer's Scorched Wood True Spirit, the never-used Cloud Wanderer Sword would finally see the light of day!</p><p>His brow flickered.</p><p>Azure sword light instantly illuminated the cave dwelling!</p><p>"Old friend, it's up to you…"</p><p>Qin Sang, filled with both excitement and a hint of melancholy, pointed at the Gu King.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword, infused with ten divine wood types, was a supreme Wood-type treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't using the Cloud Wanderer Sword to kill the Gu King; he didn't want to risk damaging its true spirit. Instead, he was catalyzing its sword intent, using the pure Wood-type treasure fused with powerful sword intent to subdue the Gu King.</p><p>If he succeeded, he could withdraw the poison pearl, the Gu King, and the Cloud Wanderer Sword into his body, maintaining this state until the poison pearl devoured the Gu King!</p>
