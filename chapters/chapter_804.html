<h1>Chapter 796: Star Conch</h1><p>Cultivators who focus on body refinement are rare, and one as strong as the hooked-nose man is even rarer.  The body refinement cultivators Qin Sang had encountered before were mostly low-level, attempting an unconventional path. However, top-tier body refinement techniques are even harder to find, and the cultivation process is extremely difficult, resulting in mediocrity and wasted time.</p><p>Qin Sang occasionally glanced at his opponent, noticing that the hooked-nose man hadn't used any magic treasures throughout the fight, likely a pure body cultivator.</p><p>Those wings, with each flap, moved like a green rainbow, showcasing incredible speed, a perfect match for the hooked-nose man's formidable physique.</p><p>As a result, Qin Sang couldn't shake off his pursuer; the distance between them was steadily shrinking.</p><p>The hooked-nose man was determined to kill Qin Sang, relentlessly pursuing him.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't continue like this. His opponent showed no signs of exhaustion, making escape virtually impossible. He would soon be caught, and he needed to devise a plan.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, abruptly changing direction and flying towards the area with the densest hurricane force.  Countless extremely dense wisps of gray gas floated in the air there; these tangible hurricane winds were incredibly powerful.</p><p>The dense hurricane left little room for maneuver.</p><p>Only in such a chaotic environment did Qin Sang see a chance.</p><p>The hooked-nose man immediately understood Qin Sang's intention, but showed no fear, changing direction without hesitation and continuing the pursuit.</p><p>As one chased and the other fled, their distance continued to lessen.</p><p>Qin Sang could almost feel the hooked-nose man's chilling gaze on his back. The man's arrogance and recklessness fueled Qin Sang's own resolve; a fierce look flashed in his eyes as he suddenly stopped, turning to glare.</p><p>The next moment, a bolt of lightning shot from his brow.</p><p>The lightning struck first, the thunder rumbling faintly afterward.</p><p>The Blackwood Sword appeared, exhibiting a stunning spectacle, aiming directly at the hooked-nose man.</p><p>He only saw the flying sword rapidly enlarging in his vision, then splitting into three—two solid, one slightly illusory—before strangely merging back into one, yet with even greater momentum.</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed the hooked-nose man's eyes.  His light wings suddenly folded, and a dazzling blue light erupted from his body, making his wings even brighter. His body twisted slightly, his fists disappearing, merging with his light wings. He didn't dodge the Blackwood Sword, instead swinging his wings forcefully to strike it.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The sword energy and blue light collided, resulting in an explosion.</p><p>The Blackwood Sword flew back.</p><p>The hooked-nose man's wings dimmed slightly. He retracted his fists, flexing his fingers, stopped by the Blackwood Sword.</p><p>The attack failed to injure the hooked-nose man, but it disrupted his momentum.</p><p>This sword-light combination technique was something Qin Sang learned from a swordsman, and he wasn't yet proficient. This was his first attempt, and he was satisfied with its power.</p><p>The hooked-nose man looked Qin Sang up and down with interest, a bloodthirsty smile spreading across his face.  "Your escape techniques and swordsmanship are rare among humans, wouldn't you agree?  In all these years, you're the first. It seems I'll be personally ending the life of a human genius today!"</p><p>The man's voice was shrill and grating.</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback by his words.</p><p>The man carried a faint demonic aura, indicating he consumed a demonic pill during his Golden Core stage.  He was clearly not a member of the Witch tribe. Yet, being human himself, he spoke such strange words.</p><p>Without a word, Qin Sang attacked again.</p><p>The hooked-nose man seemed to have just made a casual remark; his expression turned serious as he countered with another punch.</p><p>Qin Sang fought while retreating.</p><p>The hooked-nose man was too powerful. Using only his fists and wings, the Blackwood Sword struggled to parry his attacks, unable to stop his advance, causing Qin Sang to steadily lose ground and show signs of defeat.</p><p>Qin Sang had no choice but to secretly unleash the Ten Directions Yama Banner. With a wave of his hand, the banner spun rapidly, launching a jet of Nine Nether Demon Fire towards his opponent's face.</p><p>Sensing the Nine Nether Demon Fire's aura, the hooked-nose man's expression changed slightly. He flapped his wings violently, instantly shifting dozens of meters sideways, looking at the demon fire with surprise and suspicion.</p><p>The demon fire missed its target. Qin Sang's spirits, however, were lifted.</p><p>The hooked-nose man seemed to have misunderstood something. Although the Nine Nether Demon Fire only possessed a fraction of its full power, it was still intimidating enough. For someone unfamiliar with it, seeing it for the first time, a reaction like the hooked-nose man's was perfectly normal.</p><p>However, once engaging with the Nine Nether Demon Fire, one could easily gauge its power.  Nevertheless, armed only with his bare fists, the hooked-nose man didn't dare to approach the Nine Nether Demon Fire rashly.</p><p>As long as the true nature of the Nine Nether Demon Fire remained undisclosed, Qin Sang could hold his own for a while.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately used the ebony sword and demonic fire in a combined attack.</p><p>At first, the hook-nosed man was hampered, but he soon noticed something amiss.  He probed with his light wings, confirming that the demonic fire wasn't as fearsome as he'd imagined.  His expression turned from cautious to furious.</p><p>During this exchange, Qin Sang successfully escaped into the heart of the storm.</p><p>Although the hook-nosed man wasn't afraid of the waves, he had to retreat from the immense hurricane, unwilling to be caught in its power.</p><p>Thus, hampered by the hurricane, even though the hook-nosed man was significantly stronger than Qin Sang, quickly killing him proved difficult.</p><p>In the gaps between the hurricane's gusts,</p><p>After being seen through by the hook-nosed man, Qin Sang's situation grew desperate; defeat was imminent.  </p><p>The hook-nosed man, full of confidence, smashed the ebony sword with a punch.  Then, with a powerful roar, he used his light wings, sending a blue streak crashing into the demonic fire. With a deafening boom, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire was completely dispersed.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly.  Just as he was about to summon the Ten Directions Yama Banner to create new demonic fire, a sudden premonition of danger arose.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a blue light shoot out from the blue streak after it shattered the demonic fire, heading straight for him.</p><p>"A magical treasure! This man was hiding his true strength!"</p><p>The blue light was incredibly fast, only the size of a fist. It lacked overwhelming power, yet it made Qin Sang's hair stand on end.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately threw his Jin Yao lock, then flicked his wrist, releasing his double-headed [missing word - likely a type of weapon].</p><p>He'd originally planned to keep the double-headed [missing word] in reserve, but seeing the blue light, he released it without hesitation.</p><p>An astonishing event unfolded.  The Jin Yao lock, after being struck by the blue light, only resisted for a moment before emitting a mournful cry.  Its golden light violently trembled, and the lock shattered piece by piece, turning into dust.</p><p>A respectable mid-grade magical treasure was destroyed so easily before Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang finally saw the true form of the blue light: a blue seashell.</p><p>The shell's base was actually jade white, but it had tiny blue specks scattered across its surface, like beautiful stars.  The intense blue light emanated from these points.</p><p>This star snail spun rapidly, its tip pointed at Qin Sang.  It looked perfectly natural, yet it possessed astonishing destructive power. After destroying the Jin Yao lock, it continued its advance.</p>
