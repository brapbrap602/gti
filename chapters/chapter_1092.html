<h1>Chapter 184: Imperial Feather</h1><p>The Nine-Life Profound Tortoise obtained the Heavenly Phoenix Feather first and had close ties with the Four Saints Palace. Everyone knew that trying to seize the feather from the tortoise now was unrealistic.  Infighting would only lead to them being picked off one by one by the Ancient Devil and dying here. As long as the feather didn't fall into the devil's hands, it would be enough.  Seasoned veterans, they wordlessly changed their objective, intercepting the pursuing Ancient Devil's soul fragments to protect the tortoise.</p><p>Seeing their plan thwarted, the soul fragments retreated to the side of Mo Qingzhu.  The two devils joined forces, completely suppressing the Dragon King.</p><p>*Rip!*</p><p>The Dragon King was torn apart. Blood splattered across the sky; the Dragon King didn't even have time to scream.  Everyone's eyes twitched at the sight, horrified by the Ancient Devil's brutal methods.  The dragon's spirit was also imprisoned.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu snorted coldly, his hand clenching tightly. The spirit and all the flesh were compressed together, forming a massive blood sphere, refining the purest essence.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Not a single drop of the Dragon King's essence was wasted; it was all thrown into the blood coffin. Blood-red runes flickered on the coffin's surface, faintly revealing a mystical formation. The sword energy was tinged with a faint blood-red hue, and the coffin's aura surged. The storm intensified.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone shuddered, understanding the Ancient Devil's intention: to use everyone's blood and soul as a sacrifice to erode the sword energy and release his true form!</p><p>"This is an ancient treasure of the Ocean Phoenix Clan, said to be refined from a Heavenly Phoenix Feather..."</p><p>The Nine-Life Profound Tortoise flashed to the Southern Wanderer's side, obediently handing over the feather and explaining everything he knew.</p><p>The Southern Wanderer activated the Demon Subduing Stele, on high alert.  The old man took the feather, his divine sense probing it. His face was grave. "Although this treasure has been refined into something akin to a magical artifact, it still carries the aura of the Heavenly Phoenix. It requires a unique refining technique to be fully utilized.  Do you know the Phoenix Clan's method of controlling treasures?"</p><p>The last question was directed at the tortoise.</p><p>The tortoise shook his head, chuckling wryly, "Although we cooperated, the Dragon King and the Nine Phoenix King were wary of us. They would never entrust such an important treasure to me."</p><p>"Perhaps we can use our ancestral refining technique to forcibly control it, but its power will be greatly diminished. It might only be enough to send one person out..." the old man said grimly.</p><p>The Southern Wanderer relayed this information to the others through voice transmission. "We don't know how long the sword energy can hold. Once the Ancient Devil breaks free, not only will we die, but the entire Boundless Sea will be devastated. Only by repairing the ancient restrictions and restoring the sealing power can we work with the sword energy to reseal the devil.  The Ancient Devil's true form and his soul fragments are at odds; the fragments cannot control the devil puppet. Thus, without the devil's control, the puppet's power will inevitably decrease."</p><p>The "devil puppet" referred to Mo Qingzhu.  They had seen clearly that the soul fragments and the true form each had their own agendas. Although forced to cooperate due to the circumstances, they were wary of each other.</p><p>Hearing the transmission, everyone's expressions varied.  The struggle at the storm's center intensified, the blood coffin and sword energy almost indistinguishable. But the coffin's momentum was overwhelming and terrifying. On the other hand, the sword energy was rootless and sourceless; no one knew how long it could suppress the coffin.  Moreover, Mo Qingzhu and the soul fragments were too powerful; they might not even last until the coffin emerged.</p><p>"Are you two asking us to risk our lives and cover your escape?"</p><p>Old Devil Fang, in his Withered Leaf Cicada form, showed no visible expression, but his tone was clearly displeased.</p><p>"To repair the ancient restrictions, the Demon Subduing Stele must be returned, and only we know how to control it. You needn't worry, only my senior brother will leave. I will stay!" the Southern Wanderer said coldly.</p><p>"Junior Sister..." the old man began, but the Southern Wanderer interrupted him.</p><p>"Senior Brother, although you performed the Sacrificial Essence Technique later than me, you are seriously injured and haven't recovered. You won't last long.  Quickly repair the restrictions and seal the Ancient Devil, and you can save us all..."</p><p>The Southern Wanderer allowed their divine senses to scan the Heavenly Phoenix Feather.  Everyone knew she spoke the truth.  This seemed to be the only way.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, through rapid mental communication, they assessed the situation and made their decision. They were all decisive individuals.</p><p>The Nine-Life Profound Tortoise and the Great Shaman shared their knowledge of their respective clans' ancient restrictions with the old man. They hadn't fully broken the seal, only a small part, meaning there was a chance to restore it.</p><p>At that moment, the soul fragments and Mo Qingzhu were tearing apart the Dragon King.</p><p>Watching the "Dragon King" being thrown into the blood coffin, the Ancient Devil's soul fragments licked their lips greedily, but didn't dare act rashly.  Mo Qingzhu's blood-red eyes turned, fixating on the old man holding the feather.  He said coldly, "Kill!"</p><p>They also understood that if anyone escaped the crimson barrier and repaired the seal, the Ancient Devil's true form would have no chance of recovery.  The old man's situation was far better than the Dragon King's; he had many allies.</p><p>"Stop them!" Lingzhuzi shouted.</p><p>Prepared, everyone immediately stood before the old man, buying him time.  Their roles were clear.</p><p>The Great Shaman, Old Devil Fang, Lingzhuzi, and the Nine-Life Profound Tortoise attacked Mo Qingzhu. The Devil Lord, having fought the soul fragments many times and understanding them best, and the Southern Wanderer protected the old man, assisting the Devil Lord in blocking the soul fragments.</p><p>They had already placed great importance on Mo Qingzhu, but as soon as the battle began, chaos erupted.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu crossed the space, his demonic Qi filling the sky. His movements were ethereal, his escape technique so astonishing that it was difficult to pinpoint his true location.</p><p>Fortunately, they were all seasoned fighters, cooperating seamlessly. Thunder, star sand, and a tortoise shell phantom merged, forming a powerful barrier against the demonic Qi. A yellow light weaved through, leaving behind afterimages of Withered Leaf Cicadas â€“ Old Devil Fang's handiwork, patching any gaps.</p><p>Various phenomena appeared, colliding with the demonic Qi. Mo Qingzhu's figure flickered within the demonic Qi, then vanished.</p><p>*Rip!*</p><p>To everyone's shock, a hand tore through their carefully constructed barrier, reaching for the Nine-Life Profound Tortoise with lightning speed. Mo Qingzhu's gaze was ruthless, instantly identifying the slightly weaker tortoise as the weak link.</p><p>Their divine abilities were thwarted again.  Watching Mo Qingzhu tear through the barrier and rapidly approach, the tortoise was terrified.</p><p>Without hesitation, everyone moved to rescue him.</p><p>At the critical moment, the Demon Subduing Stele appeared again, combining with the tortoise's True Turtle Shell to block the fatal blow.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The Nine-Life Profound Tortoise, his heart pounding, retracted his shell.  Seeing the clear finger holes on it, his face paled.  He had meticulously refined the shell day and night; its defensive power surpassed even cultivators' magical artifacts, yet it had been pierced.</p><p>Four masters attacking Mo Qingzhu, yet they couldn't stop him, and he nearly killed the tortoise.</p><p>At this moment, everyone truly recognized Mo Qingzhu's strength.</p><p>"Go deal with the Ancient Devil's soul fragments!" Seeing this, the Southern Wanderer sent a voice transmission to the Nine-Life Profound Tortoise, changing their strategy.</p>
