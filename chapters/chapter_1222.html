<h1>Chapter 1214: Trapping the Malevolent Spirit</h1><p>The path ahead was uncertain, and the Serpent King couldn't help but feel a tinge of worry. However, seeing how Qin Sang navigated effortlessly through the dark clouds, clearly familiar with the terrain, he gradually eased his mind. It didn't seem like Qin Sang had just infiltrated the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>Although the Malevolent Spirit was powerful, without the interference of the Sin Abyss cultivators, Qin Sang and the Serpent King, working together, had the strength to protect themselves. However, shaking off the Malevolent Spirit would take some time.</p><p>Since the Malevolent Spirit had locked onto them, Qin Sang and the Serpent King couldn't conceal their auras or hide their tracks. They had no choice but to quickly head toward the location Qin Sang had chosen to trap the spirit.</p><p>As they broke through the flag formation, the Frost Lizard and Elder Ye exchanged several blows in an instant. Finally, a cold light condensed from the Snow Pearl pierced through the blood like a sharp sword.</p><p>"Elder Ye..."</p><p>Jiang Shenzi and the other two failed to stop Qin Sang and the Serpent King, leaving them in a rather awkward position. Seeing the situation unfold this way, their expressions turned somewhat sheepish. They had the advantage of numbers, three against two, with the Malevolent Spirit aiding them and the flag formation prepared in advance. Yet, they still let their targets escape.</p><p>"They won't easily shake off the Malevolent Spirit. Let's go capture them now to make up for our failure," the three said, ready to move and redeem themselves.</p><p>"No need! The Frost Lizard and Old Ghost Lu are both at their limits. The two fellow Daoists at the entrance of the Abyssal Ruins will surely give them a hard blow. Leave this place to you," Elder Ye said, halting his pursuit and giving orders to Jiang Shenzi and the others.</p><p>Jiang Shenzi was taken aback. "What about the Serpent King...?"</p><p>"I will personally deal with them! I heard that Fellow Daoist Pei perished on the Heavenly March Plateau, killed by a demon king who wielded a fire banner and thunder techniques. That must be the Moonlight Demon King, right? Old Ghost Lu is holed up in the desert, content with his little corner, and the Serpent King is of little concern. But this Moonlight Demon King is no ordinary foe. With such strength at this stage, his potential is unparalleled in my experience. He will undoubtedly become a major threat in the future."</p><p>As he spoke, Elder Ye glanced at the blood lake and continued, "Earlier, I used a secret technique to suppress the blood lake, but it was only barely effective. If the blood lake rebels, do your best to buy time to prevent all our efforts from going to waste."</p><p>Hearing Elder Ye mention the blood lake, Jiang Shenzi and the others immediately nodded solemnly, as if the blood lake was far more important than chasing Qin Sang and the Serpent King.</p><p>The exchange of divine sense took only an instant. Elder Ye cast several seals toward the blood lake, then followed the traces left by the Malevolent Spirit, transforming into a streak of bloody light as he gave chase.</p><p>Jiang Shenzi and the other two stayed behind. One remained to guard the blood lake, while the other two vanished into the ground.</p><p>In the distance, dark clouds stretched endlessly, interspersed with ancient restrictions. Qin Sang and the Serpent King fought as they moved, navigating through the narrow gaps. Before long, they sensed a powerful aura rapidly approaching from behind.</p><p>"Elder Ye is personally chasing us!" The Serpent King's expression shifted slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Elder Ye to choose them over pursuing the Frost Lizard and the others. However, he didn't panic. Peering through the dark clouds, he saw several faint mountain shadows ahead and sent a message to the Serpent King, following their earlier plan.</p><p>"Ahead is one of the spirit-trapping locations I mentioned earlier. It's more dangerous than the others, but given the circumstances, we must shake off the Malevolent Spirit as soon as possible. Fellow Daoist, assist me in luring the Malevolent Spirit into the ancient restrictions!"</p><p>"Understood!" The Serpent King responded gravely, his expression serious.</p><p>He opened his mouth and spat out a cloud of demonic mist, revealing his true form. His appearance didn't change much, except for a layer of green scales covering his body. It was clear that his half-human, half-serpent form wasn't a deliberate transformation but his true nature, a testament to his unique bloodline.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A green light sphere shot past Qin Sang and exploded within a patch of dark clouds. The clouds shifted, and the ancient restrictions activated, launching counterattacks. Streaks of green light shot out indiscriminately, targeting not only the Malevolent Spirit but also Qin Sang and the Serpent King.</p><p>The Serpent King inhaled and exhaled mist, shielding Qin Sang. Qin Sang dodged and weaved through the gaps. In contrast, the Malevolent Spirit stood tall and unyielding. The green light that struck it coiled around like ropes, only to be forcefully dispersed by the spirit.</p><p>After a while of swift movement, the mountain shadows ahead became clearer. Qin Sang's gaze swept across the area, and he quickly located a flaw in the ancient restrictions he had noticed earlier. Fortunately, it hadn't changed.</p><p>He darted into the dark clouds. The Malevolent Spirit, heedless of the danger, followed closely behind.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang entered the clouds, he felt the surrounding space grow infinitely deep. Before his eyes stretched an endless void dotted with brilliant stars, as if he had entered the depths of space. Above, below, and all around was nothingness.</p><p>The stars shimmered, each seemingly within reach yet impossibly distant. It was impossible to tell whether they were real or illusory, and even the Heavenly Eye Butterfly couldn't see through them. A profound sense of loneliness and isolation washed over him.</p><p>Feeling the power of the ancient restrictions, Qin Sang was inwardly shocked. This was the weakened state after eons of erosion. If he hadn't spotted the flaw in the restrictions before entering, he and the Malevolent Spirit would have been trapped, and escaping would have required considerable effort.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly stopped, not daring to move recklessly for fear of disturbing the restrictions. At that moment, he felt a chill on his back and knew the Malevolent Spirit's attack had followed him in. He quickly summoned the Ebony Wood Sword and slashed horizontally to the left.</p><p>The sword light drifted leisurely, seemingly cutting through nothing, but the void trembled slightly. The stars swayed like reflections in water, and a rift appeared to Qin Sang's left. Without hesitation, he leaped into it.</p><p>The void shattered, and reality returned.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the void, quietly exhaling in relief. He then noticed a storm raging within the dark clouds as the Malevolent Spirit struggled fiercely. He turned and flew away.</p><p>'Thud!'</p><p>As soon as he emerged, Qin Sang heard a dull thud and saw the Serpent King being sent flying.</p><p>While Qin Sang had lured the Malevolent Spirit into the trap, Elder Ye had caught up and was intercepted by the Serpent King. Seeing the Serpent King's bloodied lips and the many scales torn from his body, Qin Sang was startled. In such a short time, the Serpent King was already showing signs of defeat.</p><p>Elder Ye's strength was beyond imagination.</p><p>Without a word, Qin Sang directed the Ebony Wood Sword to strike at Elder Ye.</p><p>Elder Ye, about to press his advantage, suddenly felt darkness envelop him. Recognizing the sword formation Qin Sang had used earlier, he didn't dare to be careless. With a flip of his palm, a blood wheel flew above his head, spinning rapidly. Drops of blood rained down like crimson tassels, filling the air with a pungent, metallic scent.</p><p>"All blood-path secret techniques and treasures... Could he truly be a blood-nurtured avatar, similar to the 'Seed Demon Embryo'?" Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>The surrounding space grew hazy as countless gray threads within the sword formation lashed out at Elder Ye.</p><p>"The Malevolent Spirit is trapped. Let's go!" Qin Sang, having succeeded in his strike, immediately called for the Serpent King to flee. He had no intention of engaging Elder Ye in a prolonged battle. With the Malevolent Spirit's time of escape uncertain, retreat was the best option.</p><p>The Serpent King finally caught his breath, his expression easing. He glanced back at Elder Ye, recalling the sense of helplessness he had felt moments ago, and couldn't help but shudder.</p><p>A moment later, Elder Ye broke through the sword formation and watched the two fleeing figures, a slight frown creasing his brow.</p><p>They were heading in that direction with such determination, indicating they had another escape routeâ€”one deep within the Abyssal Ruins, a place even the Sin Abyss cultivators dared not venture lightly.</p>
