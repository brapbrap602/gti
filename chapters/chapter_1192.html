<h1>Chapter 1184: Falling Right into the Trap</h1><p>The two Nascent Soul cultivators were the first to confront each other.  </p><p>The moment they clashed, they held nothing back, each intent on killing the other.  </p><p>Having fought multiple times before, they were well-acquainted with each other's strengths and weaknesses.  </p><p>Their cultivation levels were similar, and neither possessed a technique that could deliver a fatal blow in a single strike. In a one-on-one battle, it was nearly impossible for either to defeat the other in a short amount of time.  </p><p>Unless something unexpected occurred, this fight would likely end like their previous encounters—both sides would suffer losses, but neither would gain a significant advantage. After a fierce battle, they would retreat in frustration.  </p><p>However, the battle between these two Nascent Soul cultivators was not without purpose.  </p><p>Within their respective factions, they were the pillars of confidence for all the lower-level cultivators.  </p><p>On the battlefield, they were the focal points, drawing the attention of thousands.  </p><p>Their every move, every technique, could influence the morale of their side and even sway the tide of the battle. Thus, even though they knew they couldn't kill each other, they held nothing back.  </p><p>Old Demon Tan flicked his arm, and the fiery chain wrapped around it loosened, swiftly detaching from his arm. One end remained in his grasp, while the other did not hang limply but instead rose high like a flaming serpent, its tip pointed directly at Si Di.  </p><p>The chain was flexible and unpredictable, incredibly agile.  </p><p>Only now could the true form of this magical artifact be seen.  </p><p>The fiery chain was over ten feet long but extremely thin. Though it was composed of interlocking metal links, it appeared more like a thread.  </p><p>Its surface was ablaze with fierce flames, radiating scorching heat.  </p><p>The chain lashed out toward Si Di, and with a loud hiss, a massive fireball erupted from it, surging toward its target with overwhelming force.  </p><p>The fireball seemed somewhat illusory, but its power was undeniable. The snowflakes in the air instantly melted, and the biting cold wind was pushed back. The surrounding space was dyed a deep crimson.  </p><p>Si Di, unwilling to be outdone, formed a hand seal with his fingers. The Yuejin Mirror abruptly halted in front of him and began to spin rapidly.  </p><p>Only now did it become clear that the golden nodules on the Yuejin Mirror were not mere decorations.  </p><p>Beams of golden light shot out from the nodules, sharp as sword energy unleashed by a sword cultivator. They pierced into the fireball, filling the air with their brilliance.  </p><p>The flames surged violently, but within them, golden flowers bloomed, transforming into thick golden pythons that devoured the fiery tendrils with ferocious intensity.  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>The fireball, having reached its limit, exploded with a deafening roar. The golden flowers and pythons vanished along with it.  </p><p>At first glance, it seemed like a draw.  </p><p>Si Di sneered, "Old Tan, it seems you haven't made much progress during this time!"  </p><p>"Likewise! Likewise!" Old Demon Tan chuckled coldly. "Let's see how much you've improved!"  </p><p>Before his words faded, Old Demon Tan suddenly flung the fiery chain forward, crossing his arms in front of his chest and rapidly forming a series of intricate hand seals.  </p><p>The chain twisted and contorted, instantly forming the shape of a lotus.  </p><p>The flames on the chain grew even more intense, and the entire artifact resembled a fiery lotus blooming in the void.  </p><p>The lotus drifted toward Si Di, appearing slow but moving with incredible speed.  </p><p>At the same time, the color of the lotus shifted from crimson to deep red, with faint blue hues flickering at its core. The temperature and aura skyrocketed, instilling a sense of dread in all who witnessed it.  </p><p>Si Di's expression turned grave. Without hesitation, he tossed the Yuejin Mirror high into the air.  </p><p>The mirror flipped abruptly, its surface facing the fiery lotus. With a resonant hum, a beam of white light shot out from its center, moving faster than the lotus itself.  </p><p>The white light was cold and metallic, possessing a tangible quality.  </p><p>Wherever the beam passed, the fiery tendrils of the lotus were instantly extinguished. The beam then plunged directly into the heart of the lotus.  </p><p>There was no shattering or explosion. Instead, the white light transformed into a radiant halo, firmly trapping the lotus within it. Even the power of the flames was sealed away.  </p><p>Whether it was a magical artifact or a Daoist technique, anything caught by the Yuejin Mirror risked being sealed. If the opponent was weaker or caught off guard, their artifact might even be seized by Si Di.  </p><p>*Crack...*  </p><p>The halo contracted, squeezing the lotus and causing it to deform slightly.  </p><p>However, Old Demon Tan was well-prepared. With a calm gesture, he directed the lotus to compress its energy before suddenly releasing it in a violent explosion!  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>The lotus shattered, and the raging flames instantly destroyed the halo. The shockwaves transformed into countless fiery serpents that surged in all directions. Amid the chaos, the fiery chain snapped forward, lashing out at Si Di with vicious intent.  </p><p>The chain, thin and nearly invisible within the chaotic flames, struck with deadly precision.  </p><p>Si Di's face paled slightly, but he seemed to have anticipated this. Without hesitation, he summoned the Yuejin Mirror back to his hand. The mirror flew back, intercepting the chain, while the golden nodules on its surface glowed, forming a layer of golden film.  </p><p>*Snap!*  </p><p>The moment the golden film solidified, the fiery chain struck.  </p><p>The Yuejin Mirror trembled, sending out ripples of energy. Both artifacts were flung back to their respective owners, and neither cultivator was injured.  </p><p>But others were not so fortunate.  </p><p>Although they tried to avoid the Nascent Soul cultivators' battle, the crowded battlefield made it difficult to escape in time. Many were caught in the aftermath, their lives extinguished by the residual energy.  </p><p>Si Di glanced down and waved his hand, dispersing the shockwaves heading toward his faction. Then, with a sweep of his gaze, his figure flickered as he flew toward the outskirts of the battlefield.  </p><p>Seeing Si Di's actions, Old Demon Tan understood that he wanted to move the fight elsewhere to avoid unnecessary casualties. Their battle would inevitably affect both sides.  </p><p>However, a strange glint flashed in Old Demon Tan's eyes.  </p><p>The direction Si Di had chosen was precisely where Chan Ling was hiding!  </p><p>Their original plan had been to wear Si Di down first, allowing Old Demon Pei to stabilize the battlefield with the Nethercrystal Tower. Then, Old Demon Tan would lure Si Di toward Chan Ling, where they could join forces to kill him.  </p><p>Unexpectedly, Si Di had walked right into their trap.  </p><p>"Walking straight into hell! Since you're seeking death, don't blame me!" Old Demon Tan sneered inwardly. Si Di's choice had fallen perfectly into their plans.  </p><p>Without hesitation, he secretly sent a signal and pursued Si Di closely.  </p><p>Meanwhile, hidden in the shadows, Qin Sang and Jing Lin had been waiting for this moment. Seeing the situation unfold, they knew the time was right. They circled around to the rear, quietly approaching the Nethercrystal Tower.  </p><p>"Come back!" Old Demon Tan feigned urgency, lashing out with the fiery chain.  </p><p>At the same time, he summoned another magical artifact—a small blue triangular flag. The flag was not large, its surface woven with cloud-like patterns that seemed to ripple with gentle waves.  </p><p>In the next moment, the flag soared into the air.  </p><p>Streams of water flowed from its surface, instantly transforming the surrounding void into a vast, watery domain.  </p><p>Two artifacts, one of water and one of fire—forces that should have been opposing—now achieved a strange harmony, complementing each other!  </p><p>Flaming serpents roamed atop the misty waves.  </p><p>Layer after layer of towering waves surged, each more ferocious than the last, amplifying the power of the fiery chain. The combined force grew increasingly terrifying, its destructive aura reaching its peak.  </p><p>Si Di turned to face the oncoming attack, his body flying backward. His expression remained calm as he silently recited an incantation.  </p><p>*Clang!*  </p><p>The Yuejin Mirror suddenly soared high into the sky, coming to a halt and radiating a brilliant light, like a golden sun. The golden light was as sharp as a sword, too intense to look at directly, causing a stinging sensation in the eyes.  </p><p>Both the fiery chain and the triangular flag were enveloped in the golden light!</p>
