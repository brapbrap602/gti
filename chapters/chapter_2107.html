<h1>Side Story 1: Plundering Treasures Amidst the Chaos at the Formless Immortal Sect (Author: Remnant Torch)</h1><p>(This side story is a fan work by "Remnant Torch" and is not related to the main storyline.)</p><p>When the suspected Ancient Devil emerged, the Formless Immortal Sect was thrown into utter chaos.</p><p>But faced with this world-shaking opportunity, many cultivators, confident in their cultivation and magical powers, chose to remain, observing the situation or perhaps seeking to exploit the turmoil.</p><p>Fortunately, the two Soul Formation experts, Sage Huiguang and Saint King Qinghu, who had been unheard of for a century, appeared and intervened.  Along with several renowned, or perhaps infamously powerful, Grand Cultivators, they formed a grand formation to suppress the devil, trapping its demonic body within a suspended lake.  For a time, precious light flickered incessantly on Emperor Bestowal Mountain, and the situation seemed to be under control.</p><p>At a treasure hall far from the battlefield...</p><p>A young girl, her form concealed, glanced periodically towards Emperor Bestowal Mountain, monitoring the battle, while stealthily making her way towards the Golden Aspect Hall, located on a peak resembling a sharp sword in the east.</p><p>“If I remember correctly, it should be soon…”</p><p>Just as she muttered this…</p><p>A terrifying power erupted from Emperor Bestowal Mountain.  Amidst violent tremors, a vast expanse of five-colored celestial light burst open, revealing a torrent of raging flames erupting outwards.  Two figures could be faintly seen within the fissure, one of whom seemed to be holding a trapped infant devil.</p><p>As for why this young girl could seemingly predict the future, it was simply because Bai Zhi was also a transmigrator.</p><p>At first, Bai Zhi only thought she had transmigrated into a cultivation world.  But as her cultivation grew and she journeyed through the Middle Continent seeking opportunities, names like the Eight Sceneries, Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, Sky Firmament Tower, Mount Unmindful, Myriad Poison Mountain, Six Continents Hall… awakened long-dormant memories.</p><p>Could it be that I've transmigrated into *Ask the Immortal Path*?</p><p>With this suspicion, Bai Zhi began to infiltrate the two Southern Barbarian Continents.  As expected, she found the Gu God Cult and their teachings about the so-called "True Void Immortal Paradise" spreading amongst the mortals.  This discovery confirmed her conjecture.</p><p>Now, witnessing that person shielding himself with a fiery barrier against Saint King Qinghu's Dharma Body's siege, then unleashing the Southern Bright Departure Fire to obliterate the Soul Formation Dharma Body with devastating force, Bai Zhi was certain of her location.</p><p>However, as a mere mid-stage Nascent Soul rogue cultivator, she absolutely couldn't compete directly with those top-tier cultivators and major sects for Emperor Bestowal Mountain and the Five Aspect Halls.</p><p>Since entering the Formless Immortal Sect, Bai Zhi had been operating in the outer areas, adhering to the principle of "anything found is a gain, quantity over quality," avoiding the most intense conflicts.</p><p>Armed with her knowledge of the plot, she arrived at the Jade Bell Pavilion, though a step behind, but with greater safety.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang escaped into the Golden Aspect Hall to evade the onslaught of demons, facing the encirclement and bombardment of numerous Demon Kings who were attacking and destroying the sword formation restrictions to force him out.</p><p>An ancient bronze mirror appeared in Bai Zhi's palm.  Its only flaw was a crack running across its surface, a constant reminder that this treasure, which had accompanied her through her transmigration, was only a fragment.</p><p>With the mirror revealed, Bai Zhi touched the reflective surface with her body.</p><p>Immediately, a figure materialized, its aura, appearance, and cultivation level identical to the young girl's.</p><p>Looking at the dimming ancient bronze mirror, Bai Zhi sighed, “Using this fragmented treasure to reflect a Nascent Soul… I wonder how many years it will take to restore its divine power.”</p><p>Having said this, she put away the mirror.</p><p>“Then, according to the plan, one of us will escape first to avoid being intercepted by the arriving Buddhists and forced to hand over the treasures; the other will infiltrate the Golden Aspect Hall to seek the opportunity.”</p><p>“I must obtain the *Taiyuan Golden罡 Sword Scripture* mentioned in the plot!”</p><p>“Naturally.  Otherwise, why would I use the fragmented treasure to reflect myself?”</p><p>The conversation between the 'two' was like talking to oneself in front of a mirror. During this brief exchange, the Southern Bright Departure Fire reappeared above the Golden Aspect Hall.  Then, a lightning-fast streak of escaping light shot out amidst the chaos, heading northeast and vanishing into the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p><p>As expected, the demons gave chase.</p><p>Bai Zhi seized this opportunity, summoning a simple bronze sword.  She aimed it at a weak point in the Golden Aspect Hall’s restrictions and unleashed a white rainbow of sword energy.  Under the astonished gazes of the observing cultivators, she swiftly entered the hall.</p><p>“Is that guy crazy? Isn’t he afraid of those Demon Kings coming back for revenge?”</p><p>After repeated attacks by the demons and the ravages of the Southern Bright Departure Fire from within, the sword formation restrictions of the Golden Aspect Hall were already on the verge of collapse.</p><p>However, it must be said that the sword formation, likely originating from an Immortal Palace, was truly extraordinary. Even in this state, forcing entry would still require considerable effort.</p><p>The opportunity was fleeting.</p><p>Bai Zhi knew that once Qin Sang escaped through the 'back door,' the Demon Kings would definitely return. Attempting to infiltrate slowly and silently was simply unrealistic.</p><p>Crisscrossing sword energies continuously struck the weak points of the sword formation.</p><p>Riding her escaping light, Bai Zhi sensed some of the demons turning their attention towards her.  In that instant, she burst through the opened restriction into the Golden Aspect Hall.  Protecting herself with the bronze sword, she moved swiftly, dodging left and right, searching for the location of the secret chamber.</p><p>“Oh? The restrictions here are open…”</p><p>Knowing that the Golden Aspect lineage had already reached the secret chamber, and were only one layer of sword energy sealing away from opening it, Bai Zhi followed their trail.  Sure enough, she arrived at the base of a stone peak shaped like a sharp sword.  The restrictions below had been opened, and only a single treasured sword, still gleaming with a chilling light after countless years, remained in front of the inconspicuous cave.</p><p>Though lacking inheritance, Bai Zhi, who had never expected to get out 'alive,' immediately ignited her lifeblood.</p><p>Since this is a sword energy seal, then I shall also break it with a sword!!</p><p>Such a reckless approach would be unthinkable under normal circumstances, but with time running out, Bai Zhi had no other choice.</p><p>The two sword energies collided, the resulting shockwave instantly tearing the surrounding pavilions, halls, and buildings into fragments.  Pale-faced, Bai Zhi struck the sealing treasured sword with her bronze sword.  Amidst a clash of metal, her body was riddled with dozens of deep wounds, and she was thrown backwards.</p><p>But this was, after all, the final seal remaining after being weakened by the cultivators of the Hidden Moon Convent.</p><p>Had it been intact, even if Bai Zhi recklessly burned her lifeblood and exhausted all her essence, she might not have been able to break it.</p><p>At this moment, the tremendous sound of demons violently breaking the formation echoed from above.</p><p>Stabilizing herself, she whooshed into the secret chamber treasury.</p><p>Inside the cave, stone swords stood like a forest.  Bai Zhi's divine sense swept over them, discovering countless sword techniques, sword scriptures, sword formations, and secret arts for honing sword intent, all rarely seen in the outside world.</p><p>“This… this is? The Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation!?”</p><p>A massive stone tablet was inscribed with the Seven Western Lunar Mansions, carved with sword energy.  Just looking at it seemed to evoke the ferocious might of the White Tiger.  It stood out prominently amongst the forest of swords.</p><p>Beneath the stone tablet was a stone platform, upon which lay a jade sword for transmitting inheritances.</p><p>Releasing her divine sense to touch the jade sword, she saw the six characters of the *Taiyuan Golden罡 Sword Scripture* clearly displayed.</p><p>Seeing that her pursuers were about to arrive, Bai Zhi immediately pried the entire stone tablet inscribed with the *Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation* loose, storing it and the jade sword in her storage pouch.  Then, glancing at the surrounding stone swords, she grabbed as many as she could, regardless of their quality, emptying the entire cave.</p><p>Having done all this, Bai Zhi turned to face the Demon Kings rushing into the cave, a triumphant smile on her face.</p><p>Then, the life in her eyes faded, and she turned to dust and scattered.</p><p>Leaving aside the enraged demons who had been completely fooled, the 'other' Bai Zhi, who had already left the Formless Immortal Sect, sensed this and sighed as if accustomed to it, “I’ve died again~ Now I need to find a secluded corner to refine my cultivation, waiting for the ascension of this world into the Greater Thousand World before attempting Soul Formation.”</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Thank you to the reader for writing such a wonderful side story, and thank you to the operations officer and management for organizing such a great event.</p><p>Feeling the reader's dedication and love for this book, Qing Shi is deeply honored.
