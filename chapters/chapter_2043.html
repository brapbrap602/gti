<h1>Chapter Two Thousand and Thirty-Four: Betrayal</h1><p>Chapter 583: Betrayal</p><p>The Shadow Devouring Leopard attacked again.</p><p>This time, under the illumination of the Demon King's Blood Restriction, Qin Sang vaguely saw an illusory shadow pouncing towards Yun Youzi with astonishing speed.</p><p>The Shadow Devouring Leopard's concealment abilities were rendered useless here.</p><p>Not only that, but its speed was also slower than before, as if a mountain was weighing it down.</p><p>“Attack its abdomen! It's gravely injured!”</p><p>Yun Youzi urged the Flawless Pearl with all his might, shouting urgently.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. The Shadow Devouring Leopard must have also been injured when it shattered the Little North Star Primordial Formation in the Abyss of Sin. This kind of injury wasn't easy to recover from, and its abdomen was its weak point.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed behind Yun Youzi, unleashing all of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and commanding the Skyfiend Yaksha to attack.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire transformed into a fire dragon, shooting out and blocking the Shadow Devouring Leopard's path.</p><p>Sensing the aura of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the Shadow Devouring Leopard's gaze narrowed slightly. It sensed that this strange flame was extraordinary and seemed to be able to threaten it as well.</p><p>What an unlucky day!</p><p>Two cultivators who hadn't even reached the Golden Core stage not only possessed magical treasures that could threaten him but could also manipulate the Demon King's Blood Restriction.</p><p>The Shadow Devouring Leopard felt some regret. If it had known this, it should have quietly eliminated these two while hidden.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>Though filled with regret, the Shadow Devouring Leopard's movements remained unhindered.</p><p>With a furious roar, thousands of claw shadows appeared, carrying a world-shattering momentum that threatened to tear everything apart.  Unexpectedly, after the claw shadows collided with the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the anticipated one-sided situation didn't materialize.</p><p>Though torn apart by the Shadow Devouring Leopard, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire swiftly coalesced after dispersing, refusing to be vanquished.</p><p>At the same time, the Skyfiend Yaksha sprang from the flames without warning, attacking from a very tricky angle, its fist slamming towards the Shadow Devouring Leopard's abdomen.</p><p>The Shadow Devouring Leopard roared repeatedly, twisting its body abruptly, not daring to take the Skyfiend Yaksha's punch head-on.</p><p>There really was an injury there!</p><p>Only after dodging the sneak attack did the Shadow Devouring Leopard repel the Skyfiend Yaksha.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Skyfiend Yaksha flew back, several claw marks etched onto its body, appearing severe, but its essence remained unharmed.</p><p>Working together, they actually managed to hold back the Shadow Devouring Leopard!</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang was also very surprised. The Ten Yama Banners was merely a low-grade magical treasure, and the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and Skyfiend Yaksha were definitely no match for the Shadow Devouring Leopard.</p><p>There was only one possible explanation for this situation: the Shadow Devouring Leopard was restricted by the Demon King's Blood Restriction and its power was greatly reduced!</p><p>He couldn't help but glance at Yun Youzi, only to see his movements becoming increasingly faster, the hand seals he was making a blur, while the light on the stone hall's walls grew brighter, pressing down on the Shadow Devouring Leopard layer by layer.</p><p>Recalling Yun Youzi's earlier transmission, Qin Sang hurriedly urged the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and Skyfiend Yaksha to continue the assault, focusing on the Shadow Devouring Leopard's injured area, while secretly channeling the Ebony Sword, his attention fixated on the leopard.</p><p>At this moment, a surprising scene unfolded.</p><p>The Shadow Devouring Leopard repeatedly tore apart the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and repelled the Skyfiend Yaksha, yet it couldn't get close to Yun Youzi. Its attempts to rush towards the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit were also thwarted, and the pressure upon it grew increasingly heavier.</p><p>Then, it glanced coldly at Yun Youzi and, decisively turning around, fled.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, quickly guessing its intentions.</p><p>The Demon King's Blood Restriction only existed within the stone hall.  Once outside its range, they would be unable to borrow its power, losing their greatest advantage and becoming easy prey.</p><p>…。。</p><p>The Shadow Devouring Leopard was well aware of the Demon King's Blood Restriction's power. It was left by a Transformation stage Great Demon and was incredibly terrifying. If Yun Youzi unleashed its full power, it could easily slay him.</p><p>Unsure of Yun Youzi's true strength, it didn't want to risk it any further. By blocking the waterfall entrance, it could trap Qin Sang and Yun Youzi with no escape.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected the Shadow Devouring Leopard to be so decisive, willing to abandon the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit when the situation turned unfavorable.</p><p>He absolutely couldn't let it escape!</p><p>However, the Shadow Devouring Leopard was extremely swift, leaving no time for intervention.</p><p>"Brother Qin!"</p><p>Yun Youzi suddenly roared.</p><p>Qin Sang had kept Yun Youzi's instructions firmly in mind. Upon hearing the shout, he reacted almost instinctively, summoning the Ebony Sword without hesitation. Instantly, his body transformed into a streak of sword light, shooting outwards.</p><p>The sound of thunder echoed through the stone hall, deafeningly loud.</p><p>The flying sword, like a startling rainbow, surged forward relentlessly.</p><p>Yun Youzi didn't disappoint Qin Sang. He extended a finger and tapped the Flawless Pearl.</p><p>In that instant, the stone hall suddenly darkened.</p><p>This was because Yun Youzi had instantly unleashed all the blood restriction power he could muster, focusing all the light and pressure onto the Shadow Devouring Leopard, drastically increasing the burden upon it.</p><p>Immediately following, the Flawless Pearl vibrated, shooting out a peculiar arrow of light.  Faster than Qin Sang's flying sword, it caught up to the Shadow Devouring Leopard and enveloped it.</p><p>The moment it was enveloped by the light arrow, the Shadow Devouring Leopard froze in a bizarre posture, immobilized in place.</p><p>Yun Youzi's previous words were no lie. The Flawless Pearl could indeed restrain demonic cultivators, even one as powerful as the Core Formation中期 Shadow Devouring Leopard.</p><p>A lightning-fast sword light arrived close behind.</p><p>After the Shadow Devouring Leopard was trapped by the Flawless Pearl, a dragon-eye-sized grey pearl flew out from the sword light.</p><p>The grey pearl was entirely greyish-white, its surface occasionally flashing with silvery-white light. It rushed out of the sword light, floating towards the Shadow Devouring Leopard, seemingly slow yet incredibly fast.</p><p>Gently rotating, the grey pearl gave the illusion of slow movement, but the silver light on its surface flashed with increasing intensity.</p><p>The seemingly small grey pearl now exuded an extremely violent power, growing stronger and stronger, causing one's entire body to tremble.</p><p>In the distance, Yun Youzi narrowed his eyes.</p><p>The Ebony Sword came to a sudden halt, then retreated explosively.</p><p>As the wielder, Qin Sang was also extremely wary of the Void Thunder, fearing being caught in its blast.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Shadow Devouring Leopard finally broke free from the Flawless Pearl's restraints, but immediately faced the terrifying Void Thunder, letting out a roar of fury and alarm.</p><p>The silver light erupted, incredibly dazzling.</p><p>It was as if a small sun had appeared within the stone hall.</p><p>However, the silver light's range was small, only encompassing an area less than a zhang in diameter.</p><p>From its eruption to its dissipation, it was but an instant, and the process was utterly silent.  Then, the silver light vanished.</p><p>Aside from a semi-circular crater on the ground and the surrounding stones pulverized into dust by the residual force, there was no other trace left, as if it had never existed.</p><p>The Shadow Devouring Leopard had also disappeared, seemingly swallowed by the silver light.</p><p>The next moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Space distorted, revealing the black leopard's form.</p><p>It appeared incredibly wretched.  Its front left leg, from the neck down, was completely gone, its bloody innards exposed, its aura incredibly weak.</p><p>But it was still alive.  With a sudden burst of speed, it fled, leaving a trail of blood!</p><p>Qin Sang watched the Shadow Devouring Leopard's retreating figure with cold eyes. He had been prepared for this.</p><p>The reason he hadn't unsealed the Corpse Pill was twofold: first, Yun Youzi's plan didn't require him to personally act, and second, he was waiting for such an opportunity to catch it off guard.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his mind, enveloping the Corpse Pill.</p><p>Just as he was about to unseal the Corpse Pill, a sudden premonition of danger surged within him.</p><p>Then, from the corner of his eye, he caught sight of a dark figure pouncing towards him.</p><p>It was the Skyfiend Yaksha!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p><p>39314241。。</p><p>...</p>
