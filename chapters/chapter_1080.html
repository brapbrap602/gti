<h1>Chapter 172  A Divided Consciousness</h1><p>The Demon Lord was delighted. He immediately tossed Lady Li a token. "Lady Li, with this Demon Island command token, you may take a few people with you to repair the altars.  This will speed things up."</p><p>"Here are the locations of the altars and the methods for their restoration. The three main altars are the most important. With this talisman, you can enter the Trial Realm where another main altar is located."</p><p>Fairy Nangui handed the jade slip and the talisman to Lady Li, informing her of the locations of the three main altars. With Fairy Nangui's guidance, it wouldn't be as troublesome and dangerous as it had been for the three alliance leaders.</p><p>Spiritual Pearl didn't say much.</p><p>Lady Li nodded, suppressed her injuries, gathered all the items, and flew down the mountain.</p><p>Fairy Nangui, the Demon Lord, and Spiritual Pearl shifted their gazes to the Ancient Demon.</p><p>Facing the three masters, the Ancient Demon ignored them. Instead, he looked towards the area beyond the mountain basin, his eyes strange, as if he had noticed something unusual.</p><p>Then, a trace of anger appeared on the Ancient Demon's face as he gritted his teeth.  "I never thought there would be a day when I, the Ancient Demon, would be betrayed by a demon servant and used as bait!"</p><p>The three were startled.</p><p>Just then, the mountain shook violently.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Around the basin, sections of the stone walls peeled off, and boulders tumbled down with a deafening roar. The earth trembled.</p><p>Countless petrified spirit trees shattered, falling to the ground. Loose rocks flew everywhere.</p><p>The ancient palaces, already extremely decayed and crumbling, immediately collapsed in sections from the shockwave, sending dust and smoke billowing into the air.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A sound like a thunderbolt from a clear sky!</p><p>A fissure suddenly cracked open on Mount Yitian.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The fissure rapidly spread from afar, crossing the slope and piercing through the entire mountain wall. It grew larger and larger as rocks tumbled into the abyss, its interior pitch black.</p><p>Looking down from above, the basin was at the very center of the fissure, completely torn apart.</p><p>Everyone was shocked and flew up to avoid the falling rocks.</p><p>However, they didn't forget the Ancient Demon. They continued to surround him, preventing him from escaping in the chaos.</p><p>The Ancient Demon had no intention of leaving.  He stood motionless on the ground, enveloped by True Demonic Qi.  The falling rocks shattered against the demonic energy.</p><p>Completely unharmed, he stared at the fissure, his expression changing.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>Fairy Nangui frowned, gazing into the depths of the fissure.</p><p>The depths were pitch black, and a dark curtain seemed to be emerging. Within the curtain, countless runes flickered, and ancient restrictive forces covered the ground, forming an impenetrable barrier.</p><p>However, there was now a crack in the barrier.</p><p>The crack was as thin as a hair, barely visible to the naked eye, but it represented a flaw in the ancient restriction!</p><p>Below the stone stele in the basin, there was another altar.</p><p>Now, the altar was located directly above the crack in the barrier.</p><p>Seeing this, Fairy Nangui exclaimed, "A crack in the ancient restriction!"</p><p>The Elder glanced towards the source of the spreading fissure and saw that it originated from the direction of the cliff face. His expression immediately changed.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>The young man and woman were still in the hall.</p><p>With the upheaval originating from there, he didn't know what had become of the two disciples.</p><p>The Elder quickly transmitted a message to Fairy Nangui, then, ignoring his own injuries, grabbed the Demon Subduing Stele and flashed towards the cliff face.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Suddenly, a large black net flew out from the depths of the fissure, shooting towards the Elder with lightning speed.</p><p>Having been ambushed once, the Elder was naturally on guard. He immediately noticed the anomaly and roared. A rainbow light burst forth, slashing at the black net.</p><p>The Elder was furious. This was the second time he had been ambushed.  Everyone seemed to be targeting him.  The most renowned sects within the human race were almost all present. Who was this newcomer?</p><p>Although he was prepared, his old injuries hadn't fully healed, and the newcomer's strength was clearly no less than his own. The rainbow light didn't break the black net but was swallowed by it instead.</p><p>The Elder was forced back.</p><p>"Where are you going, my friend?"</p><p>A figure emerged from the fissure, retracting the black net and looking at the Elder with a smile.  "I went through quite a bit of trouble to lure you into moving the Demon Subduing Stele."</p><p>The figure revealed himself to be Qingzhu!</p><p>However, his eyes held an undeniable madness and bloodlust. It was clearly Qingzhu's body controlled by a demonic soul, not his true self.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Seeing the demonic Qingzhu, all four present were surprised.</p><p>They initially thought that another faction was involved, but they found a stranger.  The Demon Lord, the Heavenly Dao Sect Master, and the Four Saints Palace disciples represented the most powerful forces among humanity, and none of them had seen this person before.</p><p>"It really was you!"</p><p>The Ancient Demon's face twisted with rage as he glared at the demonic Qingzhu.  "I helped you escape, I taught you my techniques, and you dare betray me!"</p><p>"Not at all, not at all…"</p><p>The demonic Qingzhu shook his head repeatedly.  "Everything I've done has been in accordance with the Demon Monarch's orders.  Just not *your* orders, you mere fragment of a soul!"</p><p>The corner of his mouth curled into a sneer. "Even if I were to pledge allegiance, it would be to the true Demon Monarch.  Do you think a mere soul fragment like yourself deserves my service?"</p><p>The Ancient Demon was startled.  "Him! When did he sway you?"</p><p>The demonic Qingzhu snorted. "I made a pact with him before I ever met you.  The main body spared no expense of his essence to send you out. You, a soul fragment trapped in a seal for so many years, actually developed rebellious thoughts and a divided heart! Instead of thinking about destroying the altars and breaking the ancient restriction, you wanted to establish your own power and usurp control!"</p><p>The Ancient Demon's expression shifted.  He scoffed, "He is me, and I am him. We are one and the same. What difference does it make who is master and who is servant!"</p><p>He glanced at the people in the air and suddenly understood.  He flew into a rage. "You lured these people here!"</p><p>The Ancient Demon was furious. According to his plan, he would lure the three alliance leaders to break the seal, then have the demonic Qingzhu ambush the Four Saints Palace disciples and seize the Demon Subduing Stele.  Then, he would be free to wreak havoc upon the world.  Once his power was restored, he would release his true body and devour his original self, becoming the true Demon Monarch.</p><p>All of his plans had been ruined by the demonic Qingzhu.</p><p>Sealed for so many years, his strength was far less than before. With his seal not yet broken, he was now besieged by three Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators.  His chances of survival were slim.</p><p>"I simply went with the flow. If it weren't for the need to use you as bait, to lure the Four Saints Palace into removing the Demon Subduing Stele so that I could make my arrangements in peace, and the fact that breaking the restriction requires your help, I wouldn't have released you at all."</p><p>The demonic Qingzhu said calmly, "I left the Seven Slaughter Palace that day and infiltrated the Boundless Sea. I discovered some clues and decided to use your plan against you, bringing you a few more opponents to ensure you wouldn't escape."</p><p>The four in the air listened to the exchange between the demonic Qingzhu and the Ancient Demon, their expressions varied.</p><p>The Demon Lord's heart stirred.  He narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing the demonic Qingzhu. Suddenly, something clicked.  This person's face was unfamiliar, yet he felt a sense of familiarity, as if he had seen him before.</p><p>"Are you the Sword Demon?"</p><p>The Demon Lord finally remembered.</p><p>The demonic Qingzhu turned his gaze and nodded. "Friend Yin speaks so highly of the Demon Lord. You truly live up to your reputation. It's a pity that due to unforeseen circumstances, I was unable to cultivate a deeper acquaintance with you back then."</p>
