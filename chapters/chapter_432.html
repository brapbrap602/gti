Chapter 425: The Kanli Golden Elixir


“Greetings, Uncle-Master Qi!”
Qin Sang bowed deeply upon seeing Qi Yuanshou.
Nearly thirty years had passed since their last meeting; he wondered if Qi Yuanshou’s cultivation had improved.
To Qin Sang, there was no discernible difference; his aura remained just as subtle.
In his eyes, all Golden Core cultivators were the same.
Facing Qi Yuanshou, Qin Sang felt like he was standing before a towering mountain, highlighting the vast gap between Golden Core and Foundation Establishment stages.  It was impossible to gauge Qi Yuanshou's true cultivation level.
He wondered if this would change at the Nascent Soul stage.
Mulling this over, Qin Sang rose and sat down after hearing Qi Yuanshou's instructions.
“You’ve broken through to late Foundation Establishment, yet you kept it hidden.  If I hadn't sent a message urging your return, how long would you have stayed away?  Did you not want the Kanli Golden Elixir?”
Qi Yuanshou's gaze was sharp, fixed on Qin Sang, but his tone was relaxed, devoid of accusation.
Knowing he couldn’t hide it from Qi Yuanshou, Qin Sang felt relieved at the lack of reprimand, quickly explaining, “With all due respect, Uncle-Master, I only recently broke through, my cultivation is still unstable. I feared it would disrupt your important affairs…”
“Enough!”
Qi Yuanshou didn’t want to hear Qin Sang’s excuses. With a wave of his hand, a jade box flew from the depths of the hall, landing before Qin Sang.
“This Kanli Golden Elixir is a reward for disciples who reach late Foundation Establishment and are eligible to attempt Golden Core breakthrough. It offers some assistance in achieving Golden Core.
“At your age, the Nascent Soul stage is within reach.  Normally, I'd give you the Kanli Golden Elixir after you reached that stage. However, your cultivation technique is unique, requiring constant outside experience; you may not have had time to return for it.
“The Kanli Golden Elixir has limited effects; among all the spiritual items that can aid in Golden Core formation, it's considered mid-to-lower tier. Open it and have a look.”
Qin Sang’s expression was tense as he opened the jade box.
Inside, nestled on embroidered silk, lay a spiritual elixir the size of a longan!
The elixir was entirely golden, its brilliance dazzling.  The hall seemed bathed in gold leaf.
At Shaohua Mountain, disciples eligible for a Golden Core breakthrough all receive a Kanli Golden Elixir as a reward.
Despite Qi Yuanshou's casual tone, for independent cultivators, the Kanli Golden Elixir, though only mid-to-lower tier, was a precious treasure they could only dream of obtaining.
Rumor has it that Shaohua Mountain discovered a medicinal garden in a hidden realm within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, containing the primary herb for the Kanli Golden Elixir, explaining their ability to generously reward their disciples.
The Kanli Golden Elixir lacked a strong medicinal fragrance, but atop the elixir was a tiny vortex. Within the vortex, black and white energy swirled distinctly, resembling a dragon and tiger.
The elixir’s life force, like a vibrant dragon and tiger, was extraordinarily miraculous.
Seeing Qin Sang’s captivated gaze fixed on the Kanli Golden Elixir, Qi Yuanshou sternly cautioned, “Don't think that obtaining a Kanli Golden Elixir guarantees success.  Few actually achieve Golden Core solely relying on it.  My own Golden Core breakthrough was aided by a superior-grade spiritual item bestowed by Lord Dongyang, along with years of arduous cultivation, resulting in a fortunate success.  Given your talent…”
Qin Sang was astonished. Qi Yuanshou’s Golden Core breakthrough was aided by a spiritual item gifted by Lord Dongyang; he might have also received guidance.
He wondered what merit Qi Yuanshou had performed to earn Lord Dongyang’s favor.
Qi Yuanshou paused, seeming reluctant to continue, “…you’ll inevitably need to painstakingly search for other spiritual items. Ideally, you should seek superior or top-tier ones to aid your breakthrough.  It all depends on your own fortune.”
“Thank you for your guidance, Uncle-Master. I understand!”
Qin Sang carefully put away the Kanli Golden Elixir.
Observing that Qin Sang’s expression remained unaffected by his words, showing a steady temperament,
Qi Yuanshou nodded silently, then got to the point, “I called you back intending to have you join the Taiyi Pill Sect disciples in guarding a spirit stone mine. Now that you’ve reached late Foundation Establishment, and with your unique Yuan Shen Sword Cultivation technique giving you exceptional combat skills, guarding a mine would be a waste of your talents…”
Qi Yuanshou fell into thought.
Qin Sang dared not interrupt Qi Yuanshou’s contemplation, waiting quietly for instructions.
Personally, guarding a spirit stone mine was not unpleasant; it would allow for focused cultivation free from distractions.  However, Qi Yuanshou's decision was clearly beyond his influence.
After a moment, Qi Yuanshou’s eyes lit up.  “Perfect.  Our sect's medicinal garden in the Yun Cang Great Marsh needs personnel.  The medicinal herbs are nearing maturity.  The sect plans to temporarily close the garden after the harvest; it’s a crucial time.”


My master's sect is short-handed; your going is most opportune..."

With that, Qi Yuanshou produced a jade slip.  "This is a map to a medicinal garden. The herbs grown there aren't particularly precious, but a few are auxiliary ingredients for the Kanli Golden Elixir.  If they're destroyed by the Tianxing League, it will take considerable effort to find replacements. The garden's location is quite secluded; it shouldn't be easily discovered. Be cautious.  While the herbs are valuable, your life is more important. Don't force anything if the situation seems unfavorable.  Several disciples were stationed there; I leave them entirely in your charge.”

“I obey!”

Qin Sang received the jade slip, committed its contents to memory, and departed.

Qi Yuanshou's orders were urgent; Qin Sang dared not delay.  He left a message for Zhuang Yan via a sound transmission talisman explaining the situation, then left in haste that very night.

However, he didn't rush directly to his destination.  He first went to the Earth-Sinking Cave.

The corpse pouch held a considerable number of cultivator corpses, including Yin Yan, a False Core cultivator.

False Core cultivator corpses, though not as powerful as living corpses when made into煞尸 (sha corpses), still possess considerable strength and are valuable assets.

The situation in the Yun Cang Marshes is unpredictable.  Qin Sang knew that even hunting a lion requires full effort, much less in the cultivator world teeming with experts. He needed to be fully prepared.

He patiently stayed in the Earth-Sinking Cave, refining all the corpses into sha corpses before setting off.

The medicinal garden was located deep within the Yun Cang Marshes, in a remote area.

Qin Sang traveled discreetly, employing his body techniques, and not using his Youluo Cloud. While this artifact could conceal his presence, it would be useless against powerful cultivators and could even attract unwanted attention.

About halfway through his journey, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something and changed course.

An hour later, Qin Sang appeared before a small island, hovering in mid-air, his face grim.

This island was where he had buried his senior sister Qing Ting and her husband.

Now, the island was unrecognizable!

The protective formations were broken, the cliffs collapsed, the sculptures and graves destroyed. What should have been the final resting place of a loving couple was now a ruin.

Qin Sang knew that a great war would destroy much that was beautiful, but he never expected this island to be the first casualty!

The last remaining traces of his senior sister and her husband, instead of fading with time, had been destroyed by others, now existing only in Qin Sang's memory.

Who was the damn fool who did this?!

The perpetrator must have known their actions were hateful, using brute spiritual force to obliterate the island, leaving no trace. The Yun Cang Marshes are a chaotic place; there's simply no way to investigate.
