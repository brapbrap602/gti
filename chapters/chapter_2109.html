<h1>Chapter 2099: The Ancient Pact</h1><p>Qin Sang ignored Zai Zhen, controlling the Qingluan Dharma form to gaze at the horizon.  The Wujin short spear shot out, then returned, vanishing from Qin Sang's sight. He didn't see the opponent, but sensed a faint presence lingering there, and it seemed to be more than one expert.</p><p>The other party was clearly prepared. Qin Sang had to reassess the situation.</p><p>Min Zhuo's ability to summon so many helpers surprised Qin Sang. After all, the Changyou tribe previously didn't even have a Stage Two Void Realm expert. Min Zhuo wasn't a powerful leader, yet he possessed such extensive connections. It showed that the smaller tribes of the Yi people should not be underestimated.</p><p>For countless years, they had lived in the Mist Sea, isolated from the world, forming intricate connections within their community, weaving a dense network.  It was impossible to say what relationships lay behind these tribes.</p><p>But Qin Sang also noticed that the Wujin short spear wielder's attitude was intriguing.  The person only acted after seeing Min Zhuo in trouble, offering aid with a single strike before immediately retreating.</p><p>Was the opponent hiding in the shadows to exert pressure and wait for an opportunity? Or did they see Qin Sang's strength and decide he was too difficult to deal with, unwilling to create an enemy?</p><p>With the Changyou tribe's resources, it wasn't difficult for Min Zhuo to call for help, but Qin Sang didn't believe these experts would willingly serve Min Zhuo.</p><p>While the Qingling energy was undoubtedly valuable, it was useless to cultivators at the Void Refinement level. Even if Min Zhuo was willing to share, incurring the wrath of two powerful enemies for it might not be worth it to the others.</p><p>Also, Li Yu Fu had mentioned that initially, there was an abundant supply of Qingling energy. Later, they obtained less and less. This was possibly due to the fighting between the two sides, or perhaps the Qingling energy was finite and gradually dissipated.</p><p>Faced with their great enemy, they never had a chance to investigate thoroughly.</p><p>If the Qingling energy was indeed diminishing and insufficient to satisfy the appetites of those powerful tribes, its value would be greatly reduced.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang controlled the Qingluan Dharma form to withdraw its gaze and looked at Zai Zhen. "May I inquire about this Dao friend's name?"</p><p>Zai Zhen gestured, recalling the San Ku Ring and holding it in his hand. "Yonghe Tribe, Zai Zhen!"</p><p>"So you are the Yonghe Tribe Chief, my apologies."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was flat, lacking much respect.</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma form's wings slowly closed, and the surrounding thunder and lightning gradually subsided. The lightning flashes were absorbed into the phoenix wings, tiny threads of lightning dancing between the feathers.</p><p>Seeing his actions, Si Lu and Min Zhuo also stopped.</p><p>Water and fire began to separate. The Red-feathered妖bird swallowed the fire in large gulps, burped, shook its wings, and flew to the Qingluan Dharma form's side. The white weasel disappeared again.</p><p>Min Zhuo retrieved the jade bowl and the eight-sided jade screen, his heart still pounding. He had almost felt himself pierced by the Qingluan's lightning claws.</p><p>The two sides faced off in a standoff.</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma form's gaze fell on Min Zhuo again.</p><p>His eyes were not as sharp as before, but whether looking at Zai Zhen or Min Zhuo, they made the other party's hearts tense, feeling like they were being targeted by a monstrous beast.</p><p>"Your actions, are you seeking a life-or-death battle with me?"</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma form's eyes narrowed, its tone suddenly chilling, instantly becoming murderous.</p><p>Min Zhuo's face twitched. Only facing it directly did he realize Zai Zhen's earlier description had been conservative.</p><p>Faced with the direct question, he instinctively wanted to look at Zai Zhen, but remembering Zai Zhen's instructions, he said stiffly:  "Above our ancestors, this land has always been the territory of the Changyou tribe since ancient times, yet you invaders have occupied it.  My cultivation was insufficient before, so I could only endure. Now I ask Brother Zai to help me drive away the invaders. This is only right and proper! As long as you leave, we will naturally not trouble you, and past grievances can be forgotten!"</p><p>Zai Zhen chimed in: "Shouldn't the two Dao friends disregard the Ancient Pact, bully the weak, and seize the territory of another tribe?"</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma form and the Red-feathered妖bird exchanged a glance. Qin Sang and Si Lu both heard the nervousness in Min Zhuo's tone.</p><p>This proved Qin Sang's judgment was correct: those experts were at most just there to provide support.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a cold laugh through the Qingluan Dharma form. "Bullying the weak? Tribe Chief Min just slaughtered countless of my young妖族的后辈.  That's bullying the weak!  I will settle this account with you properly!"</p><p>Si Lu also controlled his companion beast to speak: "Since Chief Zai mentioned the Ancient Pact, I clearly remember that the Ancient Pact prohibits forcing others to leave their ancestral lands."</p><p>This sea area is the territory of the Changyou tribe, but it is also the ancestral home of others, a fact supported by countless pieces of evidence!”</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>Min Zhuo was furious.</p><p>Zai Zhen calmly pointed out flaws in Si Lu's argument, questioning, “They are outsiders, not our kind, and thus not protected by the Ancient Covenant. Your words are untenable.  Furthermore, you are a Siyou tribesman, not one of our superior tribes; your interference is inappropriate. If you persist, we will report you to the superior tribes, and you will face the consequences!”</p><p>Si Lu chuckled, unmoved, “Elder Zai, have you forgotten several clauses in the Ancient Covenant? I have decided to establish a Daoist training ground here.  Qin is the master of this place, and my protector; he has already decided to pledge allegiance to me and become my vassal tribe. Why can't I interfere?”</p><p>“Absurd! These outsiders are not our kind, how can they be considered a vassal tribe!”</p><p>Min Zhuo shouted, his mind quickly recalling the Ancient Covenant. He discovered several clauses perfectly applicable to the current situation.</p><p>Firstly, the Ancient Covenant stipulates that if members of other tribes seek refuge and their requests are reasonable and do not harm the host's interests, they cannot be driven away on the grounds of being outsiders.</p><p>This aims to prevent isolation and deepening animosity between tribes.</p><p>Secondly, any tribe has the right to choose a superior tribe and pledge allegiance. If a tribe already has a superior tribe, it must first sever ties, provided there is a valid reason, such as severe oppression.</p><p>This protects the rights of smaller tribes. However, in reality, breaking away from a superior tribe is difficult and requires approval from superior tribes like the Yu tribe.</p><p>Stormworld does not have a superior tribe; therefore, allegiance to this Siyou expert does not require permission from the Zhuyan tribe.</p><p>The territories of the major superior tribes of the Yi people are separated by fog tides, but not entirely isolated. Each superior tribe's territory is only an approximate area. Subjugating a vassal tribe within another's territory sounds incredible, but it's not unheard of, as long as that vassal tribe can withstand the pressure.</p><p>Because of the Ancient Covenant and the deterrent effect of the Sacred Earthquake, inter-tribal extermination wars are rare. Without the fear of annihilation, some dare to take risks.</p><p>Stormworld doesn't belong to the Yi people, but the Ancient Covenant doesn't strictly limit them either. Perhaps the ancestors who drafted the covenant never anticipated other races daring to establish training grounds in the fog sea.</p><p>Even if Stormworld cannot legitimately become a vassal tribe, if Si Lu wishes, he can simply claim Stormworld as his subordinate, exploiting a loophole.</p><p>This was a strategy Qin Sang and Si Lu devised together: using the Ancient Covenant to transform the conflict between Stormworld and the Changyou tribe from one between the Yi people and outsiders into an internal conflict among the Yi people.</p><p>The only concern is that pushing Si Lu to the forefront might expose his identity.</p><p>Qin Sang had already considered this.</p><p>This is Zhuyan territory. Even if Si Lu’s enemies discover his identity, the Zhuyan tribe won't tolerate a Siyou army invading their land. At most, they'll send a few experts.</p><p>Si Lu's identity being revealed, negotiations between the Siyou and Zhuyan tribes—this all takes time, and time is precisely what Qin Sang lacks.</p><p>As long as the Thunder Altar is built, he will not fear the Siyou experts seeking revenge!</p><p>Qin Sang left Si Lu behind, anticipating this situation.  He hasn't detailed Si Lu's enemies, but he can guess. They understand each other implicitly.</p><p>The enemy changing from the Changyou to the stronger Siyou tribe seems like Qin Sang is courting disaster, but it's necessary for his Daoist training ground and the survival of Stormworld's inhabitants.</p><p>Qin Sang is not certain he can subdue all the helpers Min Zhuo brought.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang could kill them all, the consequences would be unbearable.</p><p>He can defend for a while, but not forever.</p><p>However, from another perspective, the Siyou tribe is complex. Si Lu's enemies don't represent the whole tribe. If he helps Si Lu eliminate his enemies and regain power in the Siyou tribe, it would be equivalent to gaining a powerful ally among the Yi people!</p><p>For Si Lu, having Qin Sang, a top expert, is a godsend.</p><p>They quickly reached an agreement.</p><p>The success of their plan, however, hinges on obtaining the Zhuyan tribe's approval.</p><p>The other party clearly understands this. Zai Zhen sneered, “Allegiance? Vassal tribe? Did you ask the Zhuyan tribe if they agree?”</p><p>The red-feathered demonic bird raised its head proudly, "I will seek the Zhuyan tribe's consent! This is a matter between our superior tribes, and none of your concern.”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>The other party clearly scorned his status.  Zai Zhen's eyes burned with anger. He said furiously, "It seems you are determined to protect them!"</p><p>"You can try to fight!"</p><p>Chi Yu, the crimson-feathered bird, countered without yielding.</p><p>Qin Sang also supported Si Lu, his Qingluan divine form's wings spread wide, thunder rumbling in the sky.</p><p>Zai Zhen's expression changed slightly. He turned to Min Zhuo, "Brother Min, what do you mean?"</p><p>Min Zhuo's face was dark. He looked deeply at the Qingluan divine form. "As long as you are willing to leave with them, other matters can be discussed.  I can compensate for the death of those demon cultivators who died at my hands, as a gesture of goodwill. Otherwise, we will settle this another day!"</p><p>Min Zhuo's words held a deeper meaning, which Qin Sang understood. It was about the Azure Spirit Qi.  It seemed Min Zhuo, seeing the situation was unfavorable, had the intention to negotiate—a perfect outcome for Qin Sang.</p><p>Zai Zhen frowned slightly. Min Zhuo's words differed somewhat from their instructions, but their main objective had been achieved, so he didn't pursue the matter.</p><p>After speaking, Min Zhuo waved his hand. "Let's go!"</p><p>Mist rose from beneath their feet, their figures slowly retreating.</p><p>The Qingluan divine form, eyes blazing, was eager for battle, but the crimson-feathered bird flew close and whispered something, apparently urging Qin Sang to swallow his anger for now.</p><p>Qin Sang, already 'attached' to Si Lu, naturally heeded his advice, coldly watching Min Zhuo and Zai Zhen retreat.</p><p>Once out of sight of the Qingluan divine form, Min Zhuo and Zai Zhen simultaneously felt their hearts lighten.  Despite being the ones who set the trap, they were the ones under the most pressure.</p><p>Zai Zhen's expression shifted slightly.  He bowed towards the calm sea. "Thank you for your assistance."</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>Ripples spread across the sea, the aura instantly dissipated; the other party had quietly left.</p><p>Min Zhuo stared at the sea, unable to determine how many people were hidden there. He murmured, "I wonder which cultivator it was?"</p><p>Zai Zhen shook his head, offering no explanation.  "Let's leave quickly. If they pursue us, with just the two of us, we would likely face a dire situation."</p><p>They immediately soared into the air, flying westward.</p><p>Min Zhuo was filled with questions. He had originally thought that Zai Zhen had brought so many experts to lure out the opponent and annihilate them, but they had retreated after this brief exchange.</p><p>Was it because they discovered the opponent's strength far exceeded their expectations, making them afraid to fight? Min Zhuo was truly confused.  Did they even have a grudge against each other?</p><p>"Brother Zai, what should we do next?" Min Zhuo couldn't help but ask.</p><p>The threat of the Storm Realm remained, and was even more terrifying than before.</p><p>What worried him most was that, the next time the turbid Qi receded, during the next struggle for the Azure Spirit Qi, if the powerful demon cultivator personally intervened, they might discover Mount Daiyu, and he simply didn't have the strength to contend with them.</p><p>After much deliberation, Min Zhuo realized he had no choice but to place his hope on Zai Zhen and the person behind him eliminating the opponent.</p><p>A relaxed smile played on Zai Zhen's face, as if he had completed a mission. He 'ummed' and said, "Brother Min can recall the Northern Sea army; there's no need to provoke them further for now."</p><p>Brother Min clearly wanted to know more than this.</p><p>Zai Zhen thought for a moment and decided to reveal some information. "I cannot fully comprehend that person's intentions. Brother Min should return and wait patiently for news.  There will certainly be further use for you later. Rest assured, Brother Min, since they have attracted that person's attention, escape will be impossible…"</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>The Qingluan divine form and the crimson-feathered bird gazed at the horizon for a long time, their true forms quietly appearing behind them.</p><p>"It seems Min Zhuo came to probe our strength," Si Lu said.</p><p>Min Zhuo's retreat this time didn't mean he would give up. The next time he came, it could be for negotiation, or to gather more experts—it all depended on Min Zhuo's choice.</p><p>However, given the resources of the Changyou clan, inviting top-tier experts wouldn't be easy.  They could at least enjoy a period of peace.</p><p>Their current priority was to buy time by any means necessary.</p><p>The main altar and three sub-altars were nearing completion. Most of the troublemakers in the Storm Realm had been exposed.  Next was to consolidate control over the Storm Realm and focus on building the altars.</p><p>The Qingluan divine form transformed into a streak of green light and merged back into Qin Sang. Qin Sang said, "Please go to the Zhuyan clan and inform them of this matter."</p><p>Si Lu nodded, his expression solemn. This trip was crucial; the Zhuyan clan's attitude would determine the success or failure of their plans.</p>
