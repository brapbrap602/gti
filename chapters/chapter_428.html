<h1>Chapter 421 The Demonic Sect</h1><p>Qin Sang glanced towards the Qingyang Market, a cold smile playing on his lips.</p><p>He had several handy magical artifacts in his pouch, keeping a few for himself.</p><p>Before the Blackwood Sword completed its absorption, years of experience had taught him that emergencies could arise, leaving him no time to set up formations.  He’d lost the Myriad Crows Pot and the Seven-Colored Parasol in the Wuyagu Valley, only the Yin-Yang Compass, with its unique function, surviving.</p><p>Lately, he'd been relying heavily on the Blackwood Sword in battle, making his methods rather monotonous.</p><p>These artifacts would provide a welcome supplement.</p><p>The remaining items were unremarkable; Qin Sang carefully sorted and stored them.</p><p>Having eliminated the lackeys of the Jiupao Daoist and made a substantial profit, Qin Sang pondered for a moment before heading to Qingyang City. Instead, he flew towards the Qingyang Market on his Youluo Cloud.</p><p>He was satisfied with killing Yin Yan; he couldn't afford to make any further moves for a while.</p><p>The Jiupao Daoist wasn't a fool; while the coincidences seemed too frequent, they couldn’t possibly all be coincidence.</p><p>It was best to return to the Qingyang Market and focus on cultivation for now.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Market.</p><p>Qin Sang, having altered his appearance, entered the market. He returned to his cave dwelling for a brief rest, washing away the dust of the journey, before walking to a building called the 'Tiange Pavilion'.</p><p>The pavilion was five stories high, beautifully crafted, a rare sight even in the bustling Qingyang Market.</p><p>Tiange Pavilion lived up to its imposing appearance, its reputation well-known throughout the Qingyang Market and the surrounding cultivation world. The true owner was said to be a merchant guild under a powerful faction, specializing in magical artifacts.</p><p>They were particularly skilled in weaponry, especially spirit swords.</p><p>Having risen to prominence in the Qingyang Market, Qin Sang was approached by several factions. After deciding to entrust the 'Sword Pavilion' to Ning Youwei, he accepted Tiange Pavilion's offer to become their guest cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang's refining heritage came from the Xuling Sect.  After the Blackwood Sword absorbed the boundless blood mulberry, he essentially gained experience in crafting magical treasures – a significant advantage over other refiners.</p><p>In the cultivation world, top-grade magical artifacts were rare.</p><p>Qin Sang specialized in spirit sword refinement, boasting a high success rate in creating high-quality artifacts – perfectly aligning with Tiange Pavilion's needs.</p><p>Tiange Pavilion was highly satisfied with Qin Sang. Even when he went on adventures or retreated into seclusion, sometimes disappearing for months, they remained patient.</p><p>“Daoist Qingfeng, you're finally here!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang in his Daoist robe, the old steward of Tiange Pavilion was overjoyed, hurrying over and lamenting.</p><p>“Daoist, you've been as elusive as a dragon! It’s been almost a year since your last trip! Those little ancestors from Qingyang Sect won't take no for an answer, constantly blaming you! We've been waiting, hoping, and nearly going mad with worry. If you hadn't appeared, they would have torn my old bones apart!”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the overly dramatic steward and chuckled, “A prestigious establishment like Tiange Pavilion is afraid of a few Qingyang Sect brats? If they dare to touch any of my friends, have your superior bring people to their sect and demand an explanation from their masters!”</p><p>Tiange Pavilion's origins were shrouded in mystery. Their backers might not fear the Qingyang Sect, but given that the Qingyang Market was Qingyang Sect's territory, they had to exercise restraint.</p><p>“A mighty dragon doesn't bully a local snake!”</p><p>The old steward shook his head, turning serious, “Daoist, how much free time do you have this time?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t beat around the bush, “I plan to stay for a while. Send out messages to everyone, and have them come.”</p><p>The old steward beamed, “Excellent! I'll do it immediately. Daoist, please rest in the fire chamber first…”</p><p>Qin Sang was familiar with the place, heading to the back hall of Tiange Pavilion.  A hidden passage extended to an underground fire vein. It was smaller than the Thunder Falcon's nest, but the fire was stable, making it ideal for refining.</p><p>The air grew hotter the deeper he went, the walls of the chamber turning crimson.</p><p>Reaching the deepest point, Qin Sang took out a token and unlocked his private fire chamber.</p><p>The chamber was sparsely furnished.</p><p>A stone platform, with a furnace in front, rested on the fire vein.  The furnace wasn't ordinary; it was covered in intricate formations. The fire was absorbed and contained within, easily controlled.</p><p>Before reaching the Core Formation stage, cultivators couldn't manipulate their own inner fire. This earth fire was the best for alchemy and refinement. Especially with the restrictive formations, there was no need to worry about controlling the flames, greatly increasing the success rate.</p><p>Qin Sang sat on the stone platform, waiting for the others, lost in thought.</p><p>By accepting Tiange Pavilion's offer, he aimed to make money while getting closer to the Qingyang Sect disciples, subtly gathering information about the sect.</p><p>With this goal in mind, he treated all Qingyang Sect disciples equally, regardless of their cultivation level or the reward, fulfilling most requests.</p><p>This included many Qi Condensation stage disciples.</p><p>Although they were from the Qingyang Sect, Qi Condensation stage cultivators were low-level in the cultivation world.  The market rules were strict, making it difficult to leverage their sect's influence. Finding a suitable magic weapon was challenging.</p><p>Commissioning one was even harder and prohibitively expensive.  They couldn't afford it.</p><p>Qin Sang's prices were fair, and she always delivered.  She was especially skilled at crafting elegant and powerful flying swords, making her highly sought after.</p><p>Over the years, through deliberate efforts and attentive courting, Qin Sang had become genuinely familiar with many Qingyang Sect disciples, gaining deeper insight into the sect.</p><p>The so-called Demon Sects weren't all inherently unruly and violent.  Unless driven by self-interest, many Demon Sects, at least within their own territories, sought to maintain a certain order—an order beneficial to themselves—to ensure the sect's survival.</p><p>Many sects were also labeled Demon Sects due to unique cultivation methods or philosophies that were unacceptable to the righteous path.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect was one such sect.</p><p>Qingyang Demon Sect disciples began by cultivating the Qingyang Demon Fire.  They first received a seed of the fire from the sect. After refining and merging with the seed, they used the Qingyang Stellar Energy to cultivate and strengthen it, increasing their cultivation as the fire grew.</p><p>However, the Qingyang Demon Fire originated from the Qingyang Stellar Energy, making it incredibly volatile.  Cultivating it was dangerous; most disciples perished from the fire's backlash, leaving behind only their remains.</p><p>After their deaths, the fire seed would remain and grow stronger.  The Qingyang Demon Sect would then reclaim the seed.  Qin Sang didn't know its purpose.</p><p>This reminded Qin Sang of the Yama Banner of the Kuiyin Sect. These two Demon Sects had some similarities.</p><p>However, the Kuiyin Sect was more ruthless.  Even if a disciple somehow survived the Yama's backlash, they would become the banner's spirit, leaving no chance of survival.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect, at least, offered a glimmer of hope.  If a disciple could suppress the fire seed's backlash, they had a chance to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, even the Core Formation stage.</p><p>The seed was reclaimed only after death.  Reaching the Core Formation stage meant becoming a top-tier member and even enjoying the benefits of having the seed removed.</p><p>Even so, this cultivation philosophy, which treated disciples as tools, was incompatible with the righteous path, making their classification as a Demon Sect undeniable.</p>
