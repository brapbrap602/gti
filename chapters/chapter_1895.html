<h1>Chapter 1886: Summoning the Gods</h1><p>Western Dipper Star Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang, having fled here, was pleasantly surprised to discover that two Star Lords' divine halls remained intact: those of Star Lord Gaoyuan and Star Lord Huangling.</p><p>The golden dragon, pulling the Divine Chariot, fled into Star Lord Gaoyuan's divine hall and prostrated itself to recover.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Star Lord's statue, pondering his escape route while checking the Divine Chariot's condition.</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>The black demon roc attacked the divine hall again.</p><p>As expected, the Western Dipper Star Lords held a higher celestial position than the Twenty-Eight Mansions Star Lords, their spiritual light barriers more robust.</p><p>The two Star Lords' divine halls were not far apart, allowing him a brief respite.</p><p>“Where to next? If I keep leading the demon roc in circles, Talisman Gods comparable to the Western Dipper Star Lords are too few and far between. I won't be so lucky later, and the burden on the Divine Chariot will be heavy. If I flee towards the heart of the Ziwei Enclosure, there are more high-ranking Talisman Gods, but…”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the scenes he'd witnessed during his escape.</p><p>He had paid particular attention to the demons' movements, observing them scrambling to enter the Heavens Beyond Heavens, disappearing beyond the clouds.  Clearly, something more enticing awaited them there.</p><p>"They haven't targeted me directly, which means the black demon roc acted on a whim. This could be an opportunity…"</p><p>……</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Under the demon roc's relentless assault, the divine hall finally succumbed.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately urged the golden dragon, teleporting to the other Star Lord's divine hall.</p><p>When the second divine hall was on the verge of collapse, Qin Sang boarded the Divine Chariot and fled.</p><p>Amidst the sea of clouds and between immortal mountains, a golden light streaked towards the heart of the Ziwei Enclosure.</p><p>Qin Sang had made his decision.</p><p>The black demon roc, having guessed Qin Sang's intentions, intensified its attacks.</p><p>Frustrated by Qin Sang's repeated use of the divine halls' barriers, its rage had reached a boiling point.  Yet, it remained powerless against the Divine Chariot.</p><p>However, the black demon roc gradually realized that the Divine Chariot was not invincible.  During the pursuit, the golden dragon's image grew increasingly faint, a clear sign of the chariot's waning power.</p><p>If the chase continued, the Divine Chariot and Qin Sang would eventually fall into its grasp.</p><p>But Qin Sang was escaping towards the Ziwei Enclosure. If he reached the divine halls of those legendary River Chart-ranked, or even Cave True-ranked, supreme Talisman Gods, the black demon roc had no confidence in breaching their barriers.  It had to stop him!</p><p>Its demonic eyes blazing crimson, the black demon roc unleashed a tempestuous barrage of attacks, forcing Qin Sang into a desperate flight.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Divine Chariot entered an open area.  Mid-flight, Qin Sang's expression hardened. He knew something was amiss!</p><p>Without warning, a strange fluctuation emanated from the poison pearl within his dantian.</p><p>“Poison!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart lurched.</p><p>He knew the Celestial Court housed Plague Department Talisman Gods, connected to the Dao of Poison, but Talisman Gods were merely manifestations of spirit talismans. Without activation, they wouldn't actively release poison.</p><p>How could there be poison within the Celestial Court?</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang, a cultivator of poison techniques, possessed a keener sensitivity to toxins than cultivators of the same realm.  He hadn't detected the poison entering his body until the poison pearl reacted and began to circulate, alerting him to its presence.</p><p>Judging by the poison pearl's reaction, this poison was not only incredibly insidious but also highly potent.</p><p>If the poison continued to accumulate within him, it would become a grave threat.</p><p>His cultivation of poisonous essence granted him resistance to potent toxins, preventing immediate death. However, in this precarious situation, even the slightest delay in his teleportation due to the poison's effects could lead to his capture by the Demon King!</p><p>"Another Demon King!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the azure-scaled serpent, likely a venomous creature.</p><p>Only a Demon King's poison Dao divine ability could elude his perception!</p><p>A Demon King had secretly laid a poison domain, setting an ambush.  Fortunately, the poison pearl had detected it!</p><p>One Demon King already had him on the run.  Against two, how long could he last?</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang urged the golden dragon, teleporting out of the poison domain.</p><p>The golden light flickered, reappearing far from its previous location.</p><p>At the edge of the poison domain, from behind an immortal mountain, a soft gasp echoed.</p><p>The azure-scaled serpent, now shrunk to the size of a normal python, was concealed there.</p><p>Seeing its poison domain so easily detected, the azure-scaled serpent was taken aback.  A sinister glint flashed in its cold eyes as it watched the Divine Chariot, its forked tongue flicking out with a ‘hiss,’ as if transmitting some signal.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>From behind another immortal mountain, a brilliant emerald light shot skyward, revealing a ferocious golden-horned demon ox.</p><p>The emerald aura enveloping the golden-horned demon ox was identical to that of the azure-scaled serpent.</p><p>Even when hunting a rabbit, a lion uses its full strength.</p><p>To ensure success, the azure-scaled serpent had used a concealment divine ability to hide itself and the ox demon before setting the ambush.  Coupled with the immortal mountains and divine halls obstructing the view, even the Skyeye Butterfly hadn't detected them.</p><p>As the golden-horned ox demon charged from behind the mountain, it didn't pursue Qin Sang directly. Instead, it leaped into the air, golden runes appearing on its horns, emitting a dazzling golden light.</p><p>Its horns seemed poised to pierce the heavens.  The ox demon inhaled deeply, its chest and abdomen swelling dramatically.</p><p>A resounding 'Dong' echoed, like a drumbeat shaking heaven and earth.</p><p>This was no ordinary sound. It was the golden-horned ox demon's innate divine ability, known as the Heart Drum, capable of shattering an enemy's spirit.</p><p>Those with weaker cultivation could have their primordial spirits instantly dispersed, resulting in death.</p><p>The tip of the golden horn was aimed directly at the fleeing Divine Chariot, unimpeded.  Qin Sang bore the brunt of the attack.</p><p>While the golden dragon could carry him away, it couldn't shield him from the Heart Drum.</p><p>As the golden-horned ox demon struck, the azure-scaled serpent transformed into a stream of light, flanking the Divine Chariot alongside the black demon roc.</p><p>What followed, however, greatly surprised the three demons.</p><p>Qin Sang, seated upon the jade throne, his back to the demons, was struck by the Heart Drum. His body swayed momentarily, but that was all.  He immediately urged the Divine Chariot to teleport once more.</p><p>The two Demon Kings missed their target.</p><p>The golden-horned ox demon's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>The chariot's occupant was clearly not at the Five Talismans realm, merely a Cave Manifestation True Lord.</p><p>The golden-horned ox demon had been close to the peak of Cave Manifestation before converting to the divine path.</p><p>It had been noticed by the Great Sage early in its rise and brought to the Great Sage's mansion to cultivate.  Even other Demon Kings addressed it as a fellow Daoist.</p><p>The golden-horned ox demon was confident that few cultivators or demon cultivators of the same realm could withstand its Heart Drum divine ability, yet it had failed against a cultivator with clearly inferior cultivation.</p><p>The poison domain and Heart Drum, a seemingly flawless ambush, had been easily countered.</p><p>Watching the three escaping streaks of light, the golden-horned ox demon wanted to test the chariot's occupant further, but it wasn't proficient in escape techniques and was quickly left behind.</p><p>Sighing, the golden-horned ox demon summoned a cloud of rosy light and returned to Thunder City.</p><p>……</p><p>“How was it? That brat and the Divine Chariot are no ordinary matter. Otherwise, this King would have captured him long ago!”</p><p>The black demon roc transmitted its voice.</p><p>It felt slightly better now.  The azure-scaled serpent's carefully planned ambush had failed, somewhat restoring its own face.</p><p>The azure-scaled serpent's eyes flickered. It coldly retorted, "Are you certain that chariot can go anywhere?"</p><p>They had only seen records of such a treasure in Daoist scriptures, never expecting its power to be so formidable.</p><p>The black demon roc hesitated. "Isn't the Celestial Court essentially the place where the Dao Court enshrines Talisman Gods? The Talisman Gods and their divine halls are the core of the Celestial Court.  If the Divine Chariot can freely traverse the divine halls, where can't it go?"</p><p>Witnessing the Divine Chariot's ability to traverse the divine halls, the black demon roc was determined to seize it!</p><p>“Why did you come down at this time? Did you encounter any trouble in Thunder City?”</p><p>“The Nine Skies block the path. Perhaps the chariot can ascend to the Nine Skies.”</p><p>The azure-scaled serpent briefly explained, a contemplative look in its eyes.  Unfortunately, among the demon gods who had entered the Celestial Court, none possessed bloodline divine abilities related to the void.</p><p>However, the Divine Chariot borrowed the power of the Celestial Court.  Even if such a divine ability existed, it likely couldn't restrict it.</p><p>"Look at the state of that golden dragon.  With our combined efforts and constant pursuit, let's see how much longer he can last," the black demon roc paused, adding, "Don't let him penetrate deep into the Three Enclosures!"</p><p>The azure-scaled serpent understood immediately, scrutinizing the Divine Chariot.  Indeed, it was as the demon roc said. Yet, a lingering worry remained in its eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang was in imminent danger, but weren't they also anxious?</p><p>They didn't know the situation outside the Celestial Court. What worried them most was the demon race's Great Sage. It hadn't managed to enter the Celestial Court after so long.  Could it be facing the siege of True Monarchs at the South Heavenly Gate?</p><p>For now, they could only follow the demon roc's suggestion, hoping for a turning point in Thunder City.</p><p>The two demons communicated secretly, never ceasing their pursuit.</p><p>Their divine abilities were vast, their coordination impeccable.</p><p>With the azure-scaled serpent joining the chase, the pressure on Qin Sang increased exponentially.  His room to maneuver dwindled, forcing him to rely on repeated teleportations to escape.  He watched helplessly as the Divine Chariot's condition worsened, his heart burning with anxiety.</p><p>The two demons couldn't prevent the Divine Chariot from teleporting, but they could try to corner it.</p><p>Qin Sang discerned their intentions but could do nothing, forced to flee towards the non-core star regions.</p><p>Even with numerous Talisman Gods, if their celestial position wasn't high enough, their divine halls' barriers couldn't withstand the combined assault of two Demon Kings for long.</p><p>Three streaks of light chased each other through the Celestial Court.</p><p>A golden rainbow, swift as lightning.</p><p>In its wake, golden halls crumbled, Talisman Gods fell, leaving behind ruins.</p><p>……</p><p>While Qin Sang was being pursued by the Demon Kings, the war on the ground raged on.</p><p>Northern Zhongmao Prefecture, Jizhen Garrison.</p><p>True Lord Ruoquan stood atop the city walls, her robes fluttering, gazing at the oppressive black demonic clouds outside the city with a worried expression.</p><p>The beast tide had arrived!</p><p>She raised her head, looking east.  The distance was too great; she couldn't see the sword shadow from here.</p><p>But Daoist cultivators in the northern immortal cities of both prefectures could sense the awe-inspiring sword intent emanating from it.</p><p>Opposing the sword intent was another terrifying aura.</p><p>Beyond the distant mountains.</p><p>The sword shadow hung in the sky. The pangolin beast, driven by pain and the drumbeats, roared furiously at the sword shadow.</p><p>Its wounds unhealed, blood trickled through the gaps in its scales.  The constant stinging pain instilled in it a primal fear of the sword shadow, preventing it from venturing any closer.</p><p>There was more than one True Monarch-level beast. Behind the beast tide, other auras no less potent than the pangolin beast's lurked, intimidated by the sword shadow and hesitant to advance.</p><p>The worry on True Lord Ruoquan's face deepened.  Everyone knew that a single sword shadow couldn't hold back all the True Monarch-level beasts.</p><p>As they became increasingly influenced by the Demon-Calling Drum, their ferocity would eventually overcome their instincts, forcing them to charge through. Could the sword shadow truly withstand the combined might of these beasts?</p><p>Even more terrifying, within the depths of the孽原and孽海, there existed beings no less formidable than True Monarch-level beasts.</p><p>Some called them demonic evils, malevolent spirits of the world.</p><p>Unlike the common perception of ghosts, Daoist scriptures described them as Six Heavens Ancient Ghosts. Some believed they were born from the Six Heavens Ancient Qi, while others considered them the source of the Six Heavens Ancient Qi.</p><p>These Six Heavens Ancient Ghosts were unaffected by the Demon-Calling Drum, but the slaughter it caused would eventually attract them with its bloodlust.</p><p>Highly cultivated cultivators could already faintly sense the malicious and restless auras.</p><p>The drumbeats showed no sign of stopping; the demons of the Guifang Kingdom had gone mad.</p><p>The beast tide wouldn't distinguish friend from foe.  The Guifang Kingdom couldn't organize defenses as tight as the Dao Court's.  They might be destroyed even sooner than the Daoists.</p><p>“The survival of the Daoist sect hangs in the balance. Can the two True Monarchs turn the tide?”</p><p>Witnessing the horrifying scene outside the city, doubt crept into True Lord Ruoquan's heart.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Ruoquan, we must personally set up the formation to guard against the great evils. The fellow Daoists from the Heavenly Medicine Department and the Plague Department are entrusted to you.”</p><p>A venerable voice reached her ears.</p><p>True Lord Ruoquan knew the speaker's identity. Turning, she bowed respectfully from afar.</p><p>Then, a streak of light flew from within the city and landed in her hand. It was a command arrow.</p><p>Multicolored streaks of light flashed within the city as teams of Daoists, following the command, gathered under True Lord Ruoquan's banner.</p><p>At its peak, the Dao Court focused primarily on Talisman Dao but encompassed all aspects of cultivation.</p><p>The Celestial Court's Talisman Gods included not only the Thunder and Dipper Departments, but also the Plague Department, the Fire Department, the Heavenly Medicine Department, and many others.</p><p>As its name suggested, the Heavenly Medicine Department originated from sects specializing in alchemy and medicine.</p><p>The Pure Spring Abbey was one such sect.</p><p>The Plague Department dealt with pestilence and poison, also related to alchemy and medicine. Therefore, Daoists cultivating these two paths were all under True Lord Ruoquan's command.</p><p>The Grand True Lords had more important tasks. True Lord Ruoquan, having severed her own cultivation, possessed wisdom and strength surpassing other Cave Manifestation True Lords, making her the natural leader.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>True Lord Ruoquan summoned her altar, her fingers grasping a jade bamboo staff, and ascended the platform to issue commands.</p><p>The other True Lords summoned their own altars, arranging themselves in formation around True Lord Ruoquan, their energies interconnected, their spiritual light illuminating the heavens!</p><p>True Lord Ruoquan paced according to the Heavenly Stems, brandishing her treasured staff. This staff, known as the Heavenly Medicine Staff, was once essential for all Heavenly Medicine Department cultivators, aiding them in their practices and incantations.</p><p>The treasured staff emitted divine light, transforming into spirit talismans in the air.</p><p>True Lord Ruoquan looked towards the heavens, chanting softly.</p><p>"Disciple of the Pure Spring Abbey, Daoist name Ruoquan, burns this talisman to address the heavens, requesting a decree of divine script.</p><p>I call upon the Heavenly Medicine Emissary, the Divine Officer of Medicine, the Jade Maiden of Healing, and the Golden Boy of Cauterization…</p><p>Grant your decree and bestow it upon my spirit altar.</p><p>Upon receiving the decree, act swiftly, without delay!</p><p>I beseech thee!"</p><p>The other True Lords chanted in unison, their voices resounding, solemn and reverent, though the deities each invoked varied.</p><p>Spell power fused with the talismans.  True Lord Ruoquan picked up a spirit talisman, her jade hand trembling as she ignited it. The fragrance, like a beam of spiritual light, ascended to the heavens.</p><p>True Lord Ruoquan's eyes burned with anticipation.</p><p>The other Daoist cultivators also gazed skyward, their faces tense, holding their breath unconsciously.</p><p>Suddenly, suppressed gasps echoed around them.</p><p>Spiritual light flickered on some of the altars, emanating from the Daoists themselves.</p><p>The talismans resonated with the celestial deities, channeling divine power downwards.  The Daoist cultivators, blessed by this power, felt an influx of potent divine energy.</p><p>This sensation, apart from the Yin Heaven Palace, was something other Daoist cultivators had never experienced in their lives, something that existed only in the records of Daoist scriptures.</p><p>It was real, and it had returned!</p><p>At this moment, all the Daoist cultivators who witnessed this spectacle were moved to tears!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
