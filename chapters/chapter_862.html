<h1>Chapter 854: The Message Talisman</h1><p>“Isn’t this person Yue Xiangu’s accomplice?”</p><p>Su Nu glanced at Qin Sang, thoughtful, unsure if he genuinely didn’t understand or was playing dumb.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression remained unchanged.</p><p>The group returned to their meeting point.  Kong Yun arrived shortly after.</p><p>The mission was a success; Su Nu was rescued, and none of the four suffered any injuries.  Everyone was overjoyed and immediately decided to return.</p><p>With the two-headed… beast’s presence revealed, Qin Sang no longer concealed it.  He let it remain outside, carrying the weakest, Su Nu, back to Da Huang Island.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang actively befriended Zhu Shanweng, inquiring about Lan Doumen and Qi Yunzi.  Zhu Shanweng, willing to cultivate a relationship with Qin Sang, didn’t expose him and answered all his questions, revealing much useful information.</p><p>Five experts, each equivalent to a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, protected Su Nu. They returned to Da Huang Island without incident.</p><p>A massive, dark mass surrounded Da Huang Island; their path was blocked by a horde of beasts.</p><p>The number of demonic beasts was countless times greater than before their departure, blotting out the sun.  Powerful auras emanated from within the beast horde, clearly belonging to transformed demonic beasts, chilling the hearts of all who witnessed it.</p><p>Seeing this scene, everyone's hearts turned cold. Who would dare cross the beast horde to return to Da Huang Island?</p><p>Yue Xiangu, however, was confident.  She led them in a detour, revealing that the beast hordes in other directions were significantly thinner. The two sides were now locked in a standoff, a battle formation. The sea between them was stained crimson with blood; the intensity of the fighting was evident.</p><p>“Wait here!”</p><p>Yue Xiangu said calmly, “I’ve received word that various factions from the Inner Sea will send experts. The cultivators on Da Huang Island are no weaker than the demonic beasts and will not surrender passively. We’ll wait for them to clash, then seize the opportunity to infiltrate, send a signal, and our reinforcements will arrive.”</p><p>They had no choice but to wait patiently at a safe distance.</p><p>After several days, the great battle finally commenced. It was large-scale. They launched a joint attack, Yue Xiangu signaled, and reinforcements arrived as promised, escaping without further incident.</p><p>“Three fellow Daoists, use this token to claim your rewards at the Xiang An Auction House.”</p><p>Yue Xiangu gave each of them a jade token.</p><p>Qin Sang received the token and bid farewell to the others.</p><p>Su Nu watched Qin Sang leave.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed her gaze but didn’t react.  On the return journey, he had noticed Su Nu’s strange behavior, her hesitant attempts to speak, ultimately saying nothing.</p><p>He didn't rush to claim his treasure; instead, he went to visit Old Man Zou after leaving the demonic sea.</p><p>Having removed Xiang Yi, a major threat, and re-established contact with the Qiong Yu Merchant Guild, it was important to build the relationship.  Using the guild and alliance's resources would be convenient.</p><p>After visiting Old Man Zou, Qin Sang set off for Da Huang Island.</p><p>After several inspections, Qin Sang entered Da Huang Island City and retrieved two items from the Xiang An Auction House, finally easing his mind.</p><p>At the auction house, he requested a private room and eagerly took out the Mao Shan Vine.</p><p>The Mao Shan Vine, known as Qing Wu Root among the demon race, had a rough, textured exterior, resembling a green root, about the size of a fist—the one Xiang Yi had sent.</p><p>Qin Sang released the restrictions on the medicinal herb.  A green light washed over him, and an intense medicinal aroma filled the air.</p><p>Each of the three medicinal herbs in the cultivation technique had unique effects; the Qing Wu Root greatly strengthened bones and muscles, increasing strength with a relatively mild effect.</p><p>Refining this herb would significantly advance the "Heavenly Demon Transformation" technique, but for the breakthrough, Qin Sang resisted the temptation, resealing the herb and storing it with the Hegemonic Blood Fruit.</p><p>“Two of the three medicinal herbs have been collected. Only the Scorpion Venom Grass remains, but there’s no news of it yet. I need a backup plan.  Perhaps Lan Doumen can provide a pleasant surprise...”</p><p>Qin Sang held a transmission talisman, lost in thought.</p><p>Besides the talisman, he had another token.</p><p>Leaving the auction house, Qin Sang quickly headed towards the transmission array, wanting to leave as quickly as possible to avoid unforeseen problems.</p><p>He didn’t see Kong Yun and Zhu Shanweng; he wondered what their rewards were.</p><p>The transmission hall was heavily guarded, a powerful defense force. Qin Sang didn't dare act recklessly; he approached and presented the token.</p><p>“I am an old friend of General Mo. Please deliver this to him.”</p><p>The guard, sensing Qin Sang's cultivation, didn't dare to be negligent.  After a short time, he returned, respectfully saying,  “General Mo has ordered that you wait at the An Yao Hall…”</p><p>The transmission hall was now closed to outsiders.  Without orders, no one could activate the transmission array. To leave Da Huang Island, they had to follow instructions.</p><p>Qin Sang said nothing and followed the guard to the An Yao Hall, finding several others already seated inside.</p><p>The hall was filled with individuals in diverse attire; some were meditating, others idly practicing their arts.  A profound silence hung in the air.  Their clothing clearly indicated their origins – disciples from the most prominent Inner Sea sects, each exuding an air of power and entitlement.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the crowd, finding no familiar faces, and quietly settled into a seat.  As more people arrived, they waited for two hours, until the twilight deepened, before the enigmatic General Mo appeared, leading them towards the teleportation hall.</p><p>Inside the teleportation hall, Qin Sang finally understood the extent of the security.  Two white-haired elders, undeniably Yuan Ying Masters, stood guard.  Even the disciples from the great sects humbly bowed before them.</p><p>“Senior Feng, these are the individuals sent by the various factions today,” General Mo reported, bowing respectfully.</p><p>One of the elders abruptly slammed his fist on the table, his beard bristling with anger.  “The Demon Sea is on the brink of collapse! Our very foundation is at stake. Yet, these factions, with their hypocritical pronouncements, keep others waiting while scrambling to send their least experienced disciples!  Without proper training, I doubt many will survive…”</p><p>“Now, now, this is nothing new,” the other elder intervened, his voice calming.  Turning to Qin Sang and the others, he smiled and said,  “Go to the teleportation array.  Remember to remain silent upon your return, to avoid any trouble.”</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the array. A flash of white light, and then, quickly crushing a teleportation talisman, he found himself spinning before landing back at a familiar teleportation hall.</p><p>“Finally home!”  Qin Sang thought, his heart pounding as he saw Yuan Ying Masters guarding this hall as well.  He quickly bowed, but they ignored him.</p><p>He chuckled wryly, then followed the guards out of the hall.</p><p>Tianxing City looked the same, yet the atmosphere was palpably different. Cultivators hurried through the streets, their brows furrowed with worry.</p><p>Qin Sang walked swiftly back to his cave.  He silently hoped that, after his absence, his external body-double was nearing completion, only the final step remaining.</p><p>Finding his cave's protective seals intact, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, entering to find several message talismans floating in the courtyard.</p>
