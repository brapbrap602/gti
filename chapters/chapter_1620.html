<h1>Chapter 1611: The Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation</h1><p>Taiyue Sect.</p><p>Located in the Southern Border, although the Taiyue Sect wasn't as proficient in using Gu poisons as the Myriad Poison Mountain, many of its disciples cultivated related mystical abilities, especially in the use of poisons.  These often proved remarkably effective in skirmishes between low-level cultivators.</p><p>Moreover, some potent poisons could be obtained from the outside world without needing arduous cultivation, making them faster to utilize than other mystical abilities.  Because of this, disciples from other sects were quite wary of both the Taiyue Sect and the Myriad Poison Mountain.</p><p>Within the mountain gate, everything appeared normal.</p><p>With the Dharma Assembly approaching, many Taiyue Sect disciples had journeyed to attend. Some followed their elders, while others, preferring freedom, traveled north with friends, taking the opportunity to explore the world.</p><p>The sect had become much quieter.</p><p>Usually, Foundation Establishment and Golden Core realm elders would constantly come and go through the mountain gate. Today, not a single one had been seen for hours. The disciples tasked with guarding the mountain were bored and drowsy.</p><p>"It's almost noon."</p><p>A young-looking boy stretched, squinting at the sun overhead. "Senior Brother Wu and the others will be here soon to relieve us.  Sigh! The Ullambana Assembly is about to begin.  It's a pity I backed down at the last moment and didn't dare attempt the bottleneck breakthrough. Otherwise, I'd have the chance to attend. It's a grand event that occurs only once every five hundred years!  A Golden Core cultivator's lifespan is only five hundred years. Missing this is truly a lifelong regret!"</p><p>The thin youth beside him looked listless. "The sect doesn't restrict our movements. If you want to go that badly, find someone to cover your shift.  Wouldn't it be enjoyable to travel with companions like Senior Sister Liu Si and the others?"</p><p>The boy's face showed fear as he shook his head repeatedly. "I heard that Northern Wasteland fiends have been frequently venturing south. Jinyu Province isn't peaceful.  Those fiends don't care which sect you belong to; they're bloodthirsty by nature.  Falling into their hands would mean certain doom! With my meager cultivation, I'd be swallowed alive and have nowhere to cry for justice."</p><p>"Coward!"</p><p>The youth scoffed.</p><p>The boy retorted, "Senior Brother Li, if you're so brave, why don't you go?"</p><p>"I'm not interested in that damned Dharma Assembly.  I'd rather spend the time practicing a few more spells and improving my life-saving techniques," the youth said disdainfully.</p><p>The boy wasn't so easily fooled. "I heard there's a sparring session at the Dharma Assembly.  Grand Ancestors from various sects will personally participate.  Observing the great ones spar is surely better than your closed-door cultivation, right?"</p><p>"Small ability, big ambition!  Grand Ancestor sparring? Could you even comprehend it?"</p><p>The youth retorted, intending to continue lecturing his junior brother, when he suddenly felt a chill. Subconsciously, he looked up at the sky, his expression freezing, his mouth agape.</p><p>At the same time, the boy also felt the light abruptly dim.</p><p>In their vision, a black curtain appeared in the sky, extending outwards from within the sect.  It wasn't like dark clouds but resembled a black cloth, rapidly spreading until it covered the entire Taiyue Sect.</p><p>Below the curtain was pure darkness, the blazing sunlight unable to penetrate.</p><p>The black curtain originated from within the sect, seemingly near the forbidden grounds.  It was unclear whether something had happened within the sect or if a sect ancestor was displaying a great mystical ability.</p><p>When the curtain covered them, night fell, and it was pitch black. They couldn't even see their companions.</p><p>"What time is it?"</p><p>"Why is the sky dark?"</p><p>...</p><p>Chaos erupted around them.</p><p>The youth finally reacted, quickly forming a hand seal. Yellow light flickered at his fingertips, and a pearl of light slowly rose.  His other hand pressed on the communication talisman at his waist.</p><p>The talisman was completely unresponsive.</p><p>Receiving no response, the youth felt increasingly uneasy. He yelled, "Quickly form the formation!"</p><p>A brief commotion followed amongst the surrounding disciples, then an eerie silence.</p><p>The youth's heart sank.  By the light of the pearl, he saw the boy he had just argued with, now stiff, his face ashen, like a walking corpse.</p><p>Terror surged through him.</p><p>The next moment, before the youth could react, he froze, the light in his eyes rapidly fading, following the boy's fate.</p><p>At the Taiyue Sect's mountain gate, the guarding disciples stood like wooden stakes.</p><p>They died without knowing why or who the culprit was.</p><p>An evil wind blew, and a streak of grey Qi shot towards them, passing through the corpses and materializing into a human figure at the mountain gate. The figure wore a grey robe, their face completely concealed. Judging by the figure beneath the robe and the slender fingers, it appeared to be a female cultivator.</p><p>The female cultivator took out an empty crystal bottle, opened the stopper, and with a gentle flick of her finger, illusory soul shadows flew from the corpses and into the bottle.</p><p>"These are all low-level disciples, not worth looking at. Junior Sister, if you lack soul bodies, I can give you a few bottles."</p><p>A sinister voice approached, materializing beside the female cultivator. It was also clad in a grey robe, but belonged to a man.</p><p>"I wouldn't dare take Senior Brother Liao's things."</p><p>The female cultivator stepped aside as the man approached, stoppered the bottle, and shook it with satisfaction. "They are disciples of a great sect after all, with solid foundations and condensed Primordial Spirits. Senior Brother's soul bodies may not be as good as theirs."</p><p>The man chuckled strangely. "Even Buddhists have the Joyful Union. Why should we fiend cultivators be bound by mundane customs?  Tonight, under the shrouded sky, is a joyous occasion!  Junior Sister, when will you stop being so guarded against me?"</p><p>"When my fiend cultivation is complete.  My chastity will eventually be sold.  If Senior Brother offers a higher price than Master, I wouldn't mind a fleeting encounter with you."</p><p>The female cultivator's words silenced the man.  She turned to look at the Taiyue Sect's forbidden grounds. "It's a pity the sect has us guarding the mountain gate.  We won't encounter any high-level cultivators."</p><p>The man said calmly, "Junior Sister, can't you see that Master is protecting us?  This is the Taiyue Sect.  The counterattack of an entire sect is no small matter... Hmm! Someone's coming!"</p><p>The black curtain stopped spreading at the edge of the Taiyue Sect.</p><p>The Taiyue Sect was deathly silent, but from the outside, it appeared sunny, with birds singing and flowers fragrant â€“ everything normal.</p><p>Two streaks of light flew from afar, a man and a woman, both Taiyue Sect disciples.</p><p>They had just returned from the Southern Border with ample rewards and planned to return to the sect for closed-door cultivation.  They never imagined that the sect had been occupied by fiends.  They flew into the mountain gate, chatting and laughing.</p><p>In an instant, their smiles froze, and they died silently, their bodies crashing to the ground.</p><p>Similar scenes played out repeatedly outside the Taiyue Sect.  The Taiyue Sect, one of the top Immortal Sects in the Nineteen Provinces of Misty Rain, had become a bloody hell!</p><p>...</p><p>Taiyue Sect Forbidden Grounds.</p><p>Soaring Dragon Cliff.</p><p>This was the place where successive Taiyue Sect Masters cultivated in seclusion.  Only Grand Cultivators, or Nascent Soul cultivators on the verge of breakthrough, were qualified to choose a cave dwelling on Soaring Dragon Cliff.</p><p>Below Soaring Dragon Cliff was a bottomless abyss.</p><p>Legend had it that in ancient times, a hidden dragon leaped from the abyss and soared into the heavens, hence the name.</p><p>Soaring Dragon Cliff had a strange wind that blew constantly, possessing a soul-eroding power.  Those with insufficient cultivation couldn't even stand on the cliff.</p><p>Now, a group of figures appeared on the rarely visited Soaring Dragon Cliff.</p><p>The group was divided into two parts.</p><p>Some stood scattered on the protruding rocks of the cliff face, most of them Golden Core cultivators.  After standing there for only a while, some couldn't endure it and flew back to the cliff top.</p><p>These people all wore grey robes, concealing their identities.</p><p>However, judging from the mystical abilities they used to resist the strange wind, they seemed to be from several different forces working together.</p><p>In front of the cliff face, another group stood suspended in mid-air.</p><p>The black, strange wind blew up from the abyss with the force of a hurricane, but it parted silently around them, not even ruffling their clothes, in stark contrast to those on the cliff face.</p><p>These people kept a certain distance from each other, their factions clear.</p><p>They no longer needed to conceal their identities.</p><p>Among them were Qin Sang's old acquaintances.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao were still inseparable, though this time without the Nether Moon Guards.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man and the Wailing Spirit Cave Master stood side-by-side, seemingly discussing something through sound transmission.  The Strange-Faced Man still had centipede scars on his face, though they were lighter than last time, and the outline of his features was barely discernible.</p><p>The two groups stood on the left and right, with another group, led by a white-haired elder, in the center. This group was the largest, including Elder Leng, who had given Qin Sang the Transforming Gu God Token.</p><p>On the periphery of the crowd were two more individuals who didn't belong to any faction.</p><p>However, their auras were no weaker than Su Zinan's and the others', both clearly Grand Cultivators.</p><p>One was powerfully built, carrying a heavy sword wrapped in white cloth of unknown material.</p><p>This person had unremarkable features, his face ordinary.  Only his eyes were exceptionally deep, as if nothing could move him.</p><p>He held a token upside down in his hand.</p><p>The back of the token bore the character 'Earth'.</p><p>The swordsman stared intently at the white-haired elder's actions, silent.</p><p>The other wore white robes, his face covered by a blue mask.</p><p>The mask appeared incredibly soft, like flowing water, yet outsiders couldn't see through this 'water' to discern his features.  It only reflected their own image.</p><p>The white-robed man sat cross-legged in the air, hands folded on his knees, a piece of Profound Ice in his palms.  It was similar in shape to the swordsman's token, but with significant differences, appearing like an imitation.</p><p>Similarly, Su Zinan held a burning red jade.</p><p>The two refined their tokens while observing the white-haired elder.</p><p>"Alright! The Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation is complete!"</p><p>The white-haired elder exhaled softly, glancing at everyone.  He addressed the person behind him, "Old Man Yue should be plotting something at the Dharma Assembly and took quite a few experts with him.  However, there are still a few formidable individuals remaining in the Taiyue Sect.  Everyone must be cautious! Junior Brother, we'll trouble you next.  Ensure that the Taiyue Sect is sealed, and no one escapes or sends out any messages."</p><p>That person acknowledged the order and left.</p><p>Including those waiting on the cliff face, everyone followed.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man said to the Wailing Spirit Cave Master, "Please make a trip, Cave Master, to prevent any accidents and ensure our success. After today, with the reappearance of the Formless Immortal Sect, we'll only have one chance."</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master agreed and was about to leave when Su Zinan called out.</p><p>"Might as well let Fellow Daoist Mo accompany the Cave Master to guarantee success."</p><p>Su Zinan finished refining the red jade and looked at the white-haired elder. "Activating the Formless Immortal Sect's great formation shouldn't require so many people, right?"</p><p>The white-haired elder looked at the others and nodded. "Three Five Phases Tokens and two imitation Five Phases Tokens, controlled by five Grand Cultivators, should have a seventy percent chance of success.  If not, we can ask Fellow Daoist Mo for assistance later. Although Fellow Daoist Su doesn't cultivate the Fire Dao, your ability to manifest other Daos through the Blood Dao is truly remarkable.  This old man admires you! Without Fellow Daoist Su's assistance, we'd likely have only a fifty percent chance."</p><p>Su Zinan said with a faint smile, "It's just that you've been hiding it from me. The Formless Immortal Sect is merely a Deity Transformation inheritance. How can your ancestors compare to my foster father? Could I be so easily fooled?  Remember the enemy I asked you to investigate?  If you'd helped me capture him, we'd have gathered all five Five Phases Tokens long ago!"</p><p>Hearing these words, everyone looked over.</p><p>"What does Fellow Daoist Su mean?" The white-haired elder asked curiously.</p><p>Su Zinan snorted. "You were the host of the Six Provinces Hall auction back then. Don't you know that person's mystical abilities? His fire manipulation technique was incredibly powerful.  Ambushed by demon cultivators, in a flash, he killed two mid-stage Transformation demon cultivators and sent a late-stage Transformation Demon King fleeing in panic. Unless the rumors about the Formless Immortal Sect are exaggerated, among the sects and forces proficient in fire manipulation in the current era, none can compare to the Formless Immortal Sect's inheritance.  That person is likely the Fire Phase inheritor of the Formless Immortal Sect!"</p><p>The white-haired elder mused, "That person's mystical abilities are indeed extraordinary. However, it's said that he could counter-kill the demon cultivators because he had help in secret.  The spiritual fire he wielded was also completely different from the records, unlike a Fire Phase inheritor. Moreover, that person only appeared once and then vanished without a trace. His whereabouts are mysterious. Unless he reveals himself, he's impossible to track."</p><p>At this point, the Strange-Faced Man, who had been listening, couldn't help but interject, "Why does Fellow Daoist Su say we could have gathered all five Five Phases Tokens? Are you certain that person possesses both the Water and Fire Five Phases Tokens?"</p><p>Su Zinan turned to the white-robed man who was focused on refining the Profound Ice, his tone strange. "We'll have to ask this Fellow Daoist to find out."</p><p>The white-robed man slowly raised his head, his expression beneath the mask invisible.</p><p>"What does Fellow Daoist Su mean? I have no connection to that person. Today is the first time I've heard of such a person from Fellow Daoist Su."</p><p>His tone carried a hint of displeasure, suspecting Su Zinan of falsely accusing him.</p><p>Su Zinan sized him up and changed the subject. "Don't be angry, Fellow Daoist. I'm just curious about what happened to the Formless Immortal Sect back then.  So, Fellow Daoist, you only obtained part of the Water Phase inheritance, not the true Water Phase inheritance?"</p><p>The white-robed man reluctantly grumbled, "Indeed!"</p><p>The white-haired elder intervened to smooth things over. "When the Formless Immortal Sect was attacked by villains, the disciples fled for their lives, most taking only part of the inheritance. The true inheritors may not have survived."</p><p>"No wonder!  It was my ignorance, Fellow Daoist, please don't take offense."</p><p>Su Zinan feigned understanding and apologized. "I've encountered a tomb that resembles that of the Water Phase Master."</p><p>Without waiting for a response, he spread his hand, his face full of regret.  "Unfortunately, someone beat me to it. By the time I arrived, only ruins remained, so I can't be certain."</p><p>"Is it that person?"</p><p>Everyone finally understood why Su Zinan pursued that person relentlessly.  It wasn't just for revenge.</p><p>Learning this news, their hearts stirred.</p><p>Unfortunately, that person hadn't appeared.</p><p>"It's him."</p><p>Su Zinan nodded.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Didn't expect you guys to be more interested in the second-place prize than me...</p><p>It's a Huawei phone.</p>
