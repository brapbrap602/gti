<h1>Chapter 465: Temperament</h1><p>Grandmother Jing's timing was impeccable.</p><p>A thrilling but ultimately safe maneuver.</p><p>"Not bad!"</p><p>Grandmother Jing offered a word of praise.</p><p>"I trust that Senior wouldn't harm me," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>This wasn't entirely flattery. Back in the Moon Pavilion market, he'd learned of Grandmother Jing's temperament—she loathed those who betrayed their benefactors or killed their companions.</p><p>Grandmother Jing chuckled, offering no comment on Qin Sang's words. "Carry on, Fellow Daoist Qin."</p><p>Under Grandmother Jing's guidance, Qin Sang ventured deeper into the forest.</p><p>He couldn't fathom her objective. Their initial direction seemed to be downwards to the right, then straight to the right, before abruptly shifting downwards again, changing multiple times.</p><p>During their journey, Grandmother Jing kept her word. Whenever they encountered easily accessible Star Essence Stones, she waited for Qin Sang to collect them before proceeding.  This didn't delay them much.</p><p>Grandmother Jing's mastery of restriction formations was extraordinary.  Except for those obviously unstable or layered restrictions, no formation with even the slightest flaw could escape her notice.</p><p>Their progress was virtually unimpeded.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully observed Grandmother Jing's every decision, gaining considerable insight.</p><p>This forest was incredibly vast.</p><p>After navigating countless perilous restrictions, they finally emerged from the forest.  Facing a chaotic tangle of thorns and brambles, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The reason was simple: this thorny jungle, though messy, was free of restrictions. He could finally relax, if only for a moment.</p><p>Barely fifteen minutes had passed since entering Pointing Heaven Peak, yet Qin Sang felt mentally exhausted. Those ancient restrictions were incredibly complex.</p><p>Grandmother Jing instructed Qin Sang to cross the thorny jungle.  She sat cross-legged on his shoulder, seemingly sensing something, and then flew to a higher vantage point to survey the surroundings.</p><p>The thorny jungle was much smaller than the forest. Qin Sang quickly reached its edge and entered another wooded area.</p><p>This time, Grandmother Jing seemed to have a clear goal, directing Qin Sang downwards to the right.</p><p>They encountered several more areas similar to the forest, dense with restrictions, and others with fewer but more concealed traps.  Grandmother Jing effortlessly discerned them all.</p><p>Jagged rocks.</p><p>They had arrived at a stone forest, devoid of any vegetation.  Bare stone pillars, no shorter than the ancient trees in the forest, stood tall, marked by wind and sand erosion.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how this landscape had formed.</p><p>A blizzard raged within the stone forest, yet there was no chill.</p><p>The snowflakes were manifestations of fragmented restrictions. What appeared to be a heavy snowfall, leaving no place to step, actually had gaps between the endless flurry of snow, though they were difficult to distinguish.</p><p>The Star Net descended, delivering two Star Essence Stones into Qin Sang's palm.  He then moved swiftly, weaving through the snowflakes. It looked perilous, but not a single flake touched him.</p><p>After a series of rapid movements, Qin Sang abruptly stopped, a look of surprise on his face. He glanced at Grandmother Jing.</p><p>A subtle spiritual power fluctuation had just appeared ahead.</p><p>The fluctuation was fleeting, but within the restrictions, it was noticeable, instantly detected by Qin Sang's keen senses.</p><p>Someone was there!</p><p>This was the first person they'd encountered since entering Pointing Heaven Peak.</p><p>"Continue!"</p><p>Grandmother Jing spoke calmly, showing no intention of detouring.</p><p>Qin Sang had no choice but to proceed, albeit more cautiously and at a slower pace.</p><p>Another spiritual power fluctuation soon appeared, lasting longer than the previous one. Qin Sang guessed the person might be collecting Star Essence Stones.  The Soul Locking Bracelet was inefficient, making the collection process slow.</p><p>As he drew closer, Qin Sang recognized the other person's identity.</p><p>Sensing Grandmother Jing's gaze, Qin Sang knew what she wanted to ask.  After a moment's hesitation, he answered truthfully, "It's Fellow Daoist Wei from the Ancient Intent Sect."</p><p>The Ancient Intent Sect was a major demonic sect in the Small Cold Region, similar to the Azure Yang Demonic Sect.  Its disciples weren't necessarily vicious.</p><p>This Wei was at the False Core Realm, quite powerful.</p><p>Grandmother Jing simply hummed.  "Go around him."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, feeling both disappointed and relieved. Grandmother Jing hadn't changed.</p><p>It was a pity it was a fellow cultivator from the Small Cold Region. If it were a rival from the Heavenly Mandate Alliance, Grandmother Jing would undoubtedly strike without hesitation. Even if the spoils went to her, obtaining the body of a False Core Realm cultivator would be a significant gain.</p><p>Qin Sang no longer concealed himself, accelerating through the snow.</p><p>Fellow Daoist Wei quickly noticed Qin Sang's presence, clearly surprised to encounter someone else here. He immediately stopped collecting Star Essence Stones.</p><p>Qin Sang then felt a sharp intent directed at him. Wei was warning him.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, bypassing Wei.</p><p>At their closest point, they were only a few stone pillars apart. The snowflakes obscured their vision, but not Qin Sang's spiritual power fluctuations.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, is that you?"</p><p>Fellow Daoist Wei couldn't help but ask, but received no response.</p><p>He remained motionless, vigilant, and refrained from attacking, extinguishing Qin Sang's last shred of hope.</p><p>Snow fell heavily.</p><p>The two passed each other by, a minor interlude.</p><p>Unknowingly, half an hour had passed.</p><p>Qin Sang had been keeping track of time. He had been continuously collecting Star Essence Stones, filling most of his pouch.</p><p>After escorting Grandmother Jing to her destination, he could collect more after escaping.  Barring any unforeseen circumstances, securing the top spot shouldn't be a problem.</p><p>After all, he had spent most of his time traveling, and the Star Net's collection speed was unimaginable to others.</p><p>For some reason, Grandmother Jing seemed to grow impatient.</p><p>After climbing over a rocky outcrop, a vast canyon stretched before them, seemingly endless.</p><p>This canyon, like the floating peak, was a distinct landmark.  They were now on the lower slopes of the mountain, but already on the other side of Pointing Heaven Peak.</p><p>Half an hour, and they had covered such a distance.</p><p>A seemingly perpetual black mist filled the canyon, obscuring everything within.  From time to time, faint glimmers of light flickered within the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang had barely steadied himself at the canyon's edge when he heard Grandmother Jing's command: "Jump!"</p><p>Her tone was不容置疑unquestionable. Qin Sang didn't know why she was so urgent, nor did he ask.</p><p>He wasn't tired of living; the fewer secrets he knew, the better.</p><p>The canyon wasn't very deep. Qin Sang landed quickly, but the air was bitterly cold.</p><p>Only upon entering the canyon did he realize countless restrictions were hidden within the black mist, incredibly well-concealed. Without Grandmother Jing's guidance, he wouldn't dare move freely here.</p><p>Continuing along the canyon, the terrain sloped downwards, and the canyon seemed to deepen.</p><p>After traveling a considerable distance, Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He immediately suppressed his aura, his eyes fixed on the turbulent black mist ahead.  He quickly confirmed it wasn't an illusion.</p><p>"Senior, there seems to be someone ahead?"</p>
