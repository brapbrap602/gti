<h1>Chapter 811: Tracking</h1><p>Chapter 811: Tracking</p><p>Linggui Island is covered in peach trees, with peach blossoms blooming year-round.  The island's protective formation is linked to the peach orchard, combining illusion and deadly power.</p><p>Whenever Elder Qingzhu gave lectures, people were allowed to land on the island, but only on the outer beach.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu resides deep within the peach orchard; no one has ever seen his face.</p><p>This information came from the head of the Wu Sect.</p><p>On the way to Bamen Island, Qin Sang put on a cloak, changing his appearance.  The enemy who even Elder Qingzhu couldn't defeat could crush him like an ant.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't want to leave it at that.</p><p>For some reason, he felt something wasn't right.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu found a teleportation array, but abandoned his return to Xiaohan Domain at the last moment. Shortly after the Qisha Hall was reopened, the Elder, who had been hidden for two hundred years, was found by his enemy and attacked.</p><p>These events seem connected.</p><p>The killer may not be his enemy!</p><p>It's also possible that Elder Qingzhu was careless and his secret was discovered.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang recalled falling from the Celestial Tower and waking up on the Witch Clan continent. Was it really the Qisha Hall's restriction that moved him?</p><p>Qin Sang felt a massive vortex swirling around him, though it hadn't yet affected him.  He hadn't felt the storm yet, much like the sea now, shrouded in mist.</p><p>He had a premonition that if he followed Elder Qingzhu's path and searched for the teleportation array, he would eventually be drawn into the vortex.  A chill ran down Qin Sang's spine.  He at least needed to identify Elder Qingzhu's enemy and know who to guard against.</p><p>After flying for a while, Qin Sang saw the outline of Bamen Island through the mist.</p><p>He didn't rush to land, but changed course and flew towards Linggui Island.</p><p>After bypassing Bamen Island and flying some distance, a scattered group of islets appeared ahead, all uninhabited. Beyond these islets lay Linggui Island.</p><p>Qin Sang circled the sea several times, but couldn't see Linggui Island. Then he discovered that the above-water portion of Linggui Island had been shattered, leaving only its base submerged.</p><p>…</p><p>Though small, Bamen Island is complete, and moreover, it's not insignificant in size.</p><p>According to the head of the Wu Sect, besides the Hanhai Sect, there are dozens of large and small forces on Bamen Island, with complex relationships.</p><p>In the center of Bamen Island is a city where cultivators and ordinary people live together, without so many rules.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the island, flew for a while, crossed mountains and valleys, and saw the city built in a basin.  The head of the Wu Sect didn't witness the battle; to find someone who did, he had to search the city.</p><p>He disguised himself as a Foundation Establishment cultivator and easily entered the city.</p><p>The storm had just passed, and sea fog enveloped the entire island, the streets sparsely populated, appearing somewhat desolate. But when Qin Sang crossed several streets and reached the cultivator market, it became lively.</p><p>This is the largest market in the nearby waters.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled through the market, sometimes entering shops to buy small items, and casually mentioned the master of Linggui Island. He actually found a shopkeeper who had witnessed the battle.</p><p>This shopkeeper was also a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but was old and had no hope of breaking through.</p><p>“Back then, I was returning from visiting a friend and was about to reach Bamen Island when I heard a thunderous boom. I turned my head and saw a brilliant light and enormous waves from the direction of Linggui Island. The shockwave even reached here, the tide surging…”</p><p>The old shopkeeper recalled the scene, “I thought some treasure had appeared and immediately flew towards the light, but it was Linggui Island under attack. Both sides were terrifyingly powerful; we were almost killed just being a little too close. I vaguely saw several figures in the brilliant light, besieging Linggui Island. Even so, the battle lasted half a day, showing we underestimated the island master's strength; at least a Yuan Ying ancestor. After this incident, all the forces, including the Hanhai Sect, were glad they hadn't angered the master of Linggui Island before.”</p><p>The old shopkeeper said regretfully, “To think, a Yuan Ying ancestor lived among us, in seclusion for over two hundred years, unknown to anyone. Such a chance encounter, yet no one seized it. If I had known, I would have gone to the island to beg every day.”</p><p>Qin Sang sat with the old shopkeeper, listening to his story, piecing together the events of that day.</p><p>At the end of the battle, someone laughed wildly in the brilliant light.</p><p>The formation was broken, Linggui Island destroyed, and no one escaped.</p><p>Those who attacked Linggui Island left after destroying the island. When onlookers approached, they found Linggui Island submerged.</p><p>"Is it true that Elder Qingzhu is dead?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of unreality after hearing the confirmation from the old shopkeeper.  The elder he most respected wasn't one of the Yuan Ying masters from Dongyang, but the wandering cultivator and Qingzhu.</p><p>He had never met Qingzhu, but he'd heard many tales of the elder's legendary feats.</p><p>Practicing the same *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang* cultivation method, Qin Sang knew very well the terrible pain Qingzhu must have endured without the jade Buddha's protection. Yet, by splitting his soul, he not only persevered but also achieved phenomenal success, becoming the fastest cultivator to reach the Core Formation stage in the history of Shaohua Mountain!</p><p>Despite the incomplete cultivation technique, he never gave up. He even created two powerful talismans, reaching the peak of his later cultivation stages.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu, after the death of his beloved,  in a fit of rage,  carved a path through a mountain, entered a dragon's lair, and took revenge on his enemies. Forced into exile, he was a true swordsman who lived by his own code.</p><p>Who wouldn't admire such an exceptional swordsman?</p><p>And yet, he died so quietly, overwhelmed by his attackers.</p><p>Leaving the shop, Qin Sang looked towards Spirit Turtle Island, sighing at the capriciousness of fate.</p><p>He hadn't found any clues about the killers. They had come solely for Elder Qingzhu, destroying Spirit Turtle Island before leaving without harming anyone else.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to rent a cave dwelling in the market town and stay for a while, hoping to find some trace of them.</p><p>While searching for accommodation in the streets, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly flickered. He subtly turned down an alleyway, then changed his mind completely and headed straight for the outskirts of the city.</p><p>After Qin Sang left, two figures emerged and silently followed him.</p><p>One tall, one short, they wore Taoist robes adorned with wave-like patterns.  Following Qin Sang out of the city, they saw him use his movement techniques, dashing into the forest.  They exchanged a glance and said in unison, "Chase!"</p><p>"Junior Brother, did you find out this person's identity?"</p><p>The taller cultivator asked, turning his head.</p><p>The shorter cultivator shook his head. "No. I asked the shopkeepers; he claimed to be an outsider wanting to become a disciple of the Spirit Turtle Island master. That’s ancient history. Judging by his aura, he's just reached the Qi Condensation stage. He's not someone Master told us to watch out for. We don't need to report him to the sect. Let's just kill him and get some quick wealth."</p><p>"Whoa, this guy's pretty fast."</p><p>The two chased into the dense forest, but lost their target.</p><p>Suddenly, a faint voice came from behind them: "Are you two looking for me?"</p>
