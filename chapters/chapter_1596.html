<h1></h1><p>After a display of force and some carefully chosen words, the grotesque-faced cultivator's disciple was induced to release his Nascent Soul, allowing Qin Sang to capture it alive.</p><p>The sword formation trapped the Nascent Soul.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, appearing above.  He calmly cast several restrictive spells, sealing the Nascent Soul. He was just about to retrieve it and escape to another location.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the moment the grotesque-faced cultivator's disciple's Nascent Soul was restrained, his eyes suddenly became rigid, and a layer of gray light pervaded his pupils.</p><p>At the same time, an aura of decay and withering emanated from the Nascent Soul, from the inside out.</p><p>Life force began to drain from within.</p><p>The grotesque-faced cultivator's disciple instantly withered to the extreme.</p><p>This scene reminded Qin Sang of the Withering Hell Prison the grotesque-faced cultivator used against his avatar.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this was bad.  He quickly chanted incantations, a stream of light shooting from his fingertips into the Nascent Soul's brow, attempting to halt its withering.  However, he discovered that this deathly energy erupted from the disciple's very soul and couldn't be stopped externally.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Nascent Soul completely dried up, resembling tree bark, its face etched with the stillness of death.</p><p>On the verge of death, a strange glint flickered in the gray eyes, clearly not under the grotesque-faced cultivator’s disciple's control. The eyes moved slightly, attempting to see the enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang gave up on saving him.  He extended two fingers and with a single strike of Heavenly Thunder, blasted the Nascent Soul into ashes.</p><p>"What a devoted master!"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly.</p><p>Just now, when the gray tide descended, the grotesque-faced cultivator didn't forget to activate his wooden armor to protect his disciple.</p><p>Qin Sang had assumed that this person was the grotesque-faced cultivator's direct disciple and highly valued.  Thus, he decided to capture him and search his soul to investigate the grotesque-faced cultivator's background and strength.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the grotesque-faced cultivator had already placed a restriction within his disciple's body.</p><p>The restriction didn't even wait for the disciple to be soul-searched.  The moment the Nascent Soul was restrained, the restriction immediately activated, leaving no opportunity to exploit.</p><p>Helpless, Qin Sang collected the grotesque-faced cultivator's disciple's Mustard Seed Bag and allowed his corpse to be swept away by the tide.</p><p>At this moment, the Sky-Eye Butterfly sent a warning. The grotesque-faced cultivator seemed to have sensed something and was rushing in this direction.</p><p>Simultaneously, another figure approached from a different direction.</p><p>This person didn't appear to be passing by coincidentally.  He moved quite comfortably within the tide, indicating considerable cultivation.</p><p>Did the grotesque-faced cultivator have other accomplices?</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly surprised.  He had been considering confronting the grotesque-faced cultivator himself but now had to abandon the idea. He vanished into the depths of the tide.</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>Two figures arrived one after the other at the location where the grotesque-faced cultivator's disciple had perished.</p><p>Compared to his appearance in the Southern Prefecture, the scars on the grotesque-faced cultivator's face had faded, revealing normal facial features, no longer as terrifying.</p><p>He scanned the surroundings. His right arm gradually became wooden, his five fingers spreading, radiating a green halo representing life force.</p><p>Tiny buds sprouted from his skin, rapidly growing into countless blades of grass, each as fine as a hair.  They resembled a patch of green velvet, swaying gently, spreading in all directions.</p><p>The grotesque-faced cultivator closed his eyes slightly, attempting to use this divine ability to capture any residual aura from the fight.</p><p>Unfortunately, the surging tide had obliterated all traces.</p><p>Finding nothing, the grotesque-faced cultivator withdrew his divine ability, his face grim.</p><p>The other person had remained hovering at the periphery.  Only after the grotesque-faced cultivator finished did he flash over and stand beside him. This person wore a black robe that concealed his face, perpetually shrouded in a layer of black mist, quite mysterious.</p><p>The black-robed figure asked indifferently, "Your disciple is dead?"</p><p>The grotesque-faced cultivator snorted coldly, remaining silent.</p><p>"I warned you… How much did he actually know? If he were captured alive and revealed your identity, do you know the consequences?"  The black-robed figure's tone held a hint of displeasure.</p><p>"If this old man dared to let him know, I wouldn't fear exposure!"</p><p>The grotesque-faced cultivator retorted coldly.  "After this matter is concluded, I still need to enter seclusion for fifty years."</p><p>"Didn't you say you only needed ten years? Why so long? Fifty years? The Ullambana Assembly will be over by then!"</p><p>The black-robed figure was displeased. He fell silent for a moment, then chuckled, as if suddenly understanding.  "I've always wondered how you could train such a disciple… With your cunning, you wouldn't have only one plan, would you?  This matter is of utmost importance.  You must emerge from seclusion before the Ullambana Assembly and search for the other Five Phase Tokens. I will assist you in secret."</p><p>The grotesque-faced cultivator grew impatient. "When the descendants of the five lineages see the pattern on the Gu God Token, they will naturally come looking for us. Why bother with so much trouble?  If no one comes, it means the lineage is broken.  Where would we find the Five Phase Tokens then?"</p><p>"The Buddhist and Daoist sects consider the descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect as thorns in their sides. If that lineage has declined and the descendant's cultivation is insufficient, they certainly wouldn't dare to reveal themselves.  Or perhaps someone is deliberately hiding in the shadows, harboring ulterior motives? As long as they emerge, they will inevitably leave traces, which won't escape your discerning eyes."</p><p>The black-robed figure offered a compliment, then paused, his voice turning serious. "Neither of us wants to hide in the shadows forever, afraid to show our true faces. It's time to reclaim what belongs to the Formless Immortal Sect. This Ullambana Assembly is a once-in-a-millennium opportunity.  We should cooperate fully."</p><p>The corners of the grotesque-faced cultivator's mouth curled into a sneer. "Since we're talking about full cooperation, why did you hesitate when this old man contacted you before? Mount Nian has sealed itself off. When will you assist me in attacking Zhuozhou Prefecture?  Once we obtain the spiritual treasure, you can have it."</p><p>By this time, the tide was nearing its end.</p><p>The black-robed figure observed their surroundings as he spoke.  "Are you referring to that Patriarch Xie of Pu Mountain in Zhuozhou Prefecture? Unless we capture him alive and force him to reveal the 'Compendium of Treasures', what use is the spiritual treasure to me?  Both being in Zhuozhou Prefecture, even if Mount Nian is sealed, couldn't they still support Pu Mountain? Patriarch Xie has a close relationship with Lu Zhang, and Situ Yu has high hopes for Lu Zhang.  If we make a move, Situ Yu will definitely emerge.  Situ Yu rose to fame in a single battle. Since taking over as the sect leader of Mount Nian, the Dragon Residence Grotto's influence in Zhuozhou Prefecture has been repeatedly curtailed, suffering several setbacks, which demonstrates his capabilities.  Unless Situ Yu perishes, or you have absolute certainty that you can easily break through the protective formation, slay Patriarch Xie, and erase all traces, both of us are highly likely to be exposed as a result. The Ullambana Assembly is approaching, so let's not create unnecessary complications.  If we are targeted by the Eight Scenery Pavilion and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, we'll only lose more than we gain.  Once this matter is settled, we can take whatever we want!"</p><p>Faced with the black-robed figure's earnest persuasion, the grotesque-faced cultivator only responded with a sneer.</p><p>The black-robed figure sighed helplessly, making a promise.  "There's an ancient Crimson Profound Tree in the Heavenly Hao Tower. I'll do everything I can to help you obtain it."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>…</p><p>In the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang employed his previous tactic, using the Sky-Eye Butterfly to observe from afar, but he couldn't hear their conversation.</p><p>The gray tide gradually receded.</p><p>He had thought that the interior of the Forgotten Palace would be calm for a while, but unexpectedly, after the gray tide, another unforeseen transformation occurred.</p><p>Above the sea, a storm raged.</p><p>When the gray tide descended, it pushed the storm's power to its peak, creating towering waves. Several nearby islands were also affected, and many cultivators were inadvertently injured.</p><p>The vegetation on the islands was uprooted, the ground itself scraped away, as mountains crumbled and the earth split.</p><p>But after this most intense wave, the cultivators discovered that the storm formed by the turbulent currents began to shrink. The Forgotten Palace was actually closing!</p><p>No one expected that the Forgotten Palace's ruins would be open for such a short time.</p><p>To be trapped within the Forgotten Palace would mean certain death.</p><p>In an instant, the cultivators inside the Forgotten Palace ruins, having just experienced the gray tide, fled frantically.</p><p>Su Zinan was no exception.</p><p>Qin Sang had been considering whether to follow the grotesque-faced cultivator or continue tracking Su Zinan. Now he didn't need to think anymore; escape was paramount!</p><p>*Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!*</p><p>Escapes of various colors shot out from the turbulent currents. Those who had persisted until now were mostly Nascent Soul Patriarchs, all of them now devoid of their usual composure, looking utterly disheveled, and many were injured.</p><p>They scanned their surroundings, unanimously searching for Su Zinan, eager for an explanation.</p><p>This opening of the Forgotten Palace ruins had ended too abruptly. Not only had they gained nothing, but they had also suffered heavy losses during the gray tide.</p><p>The entrance to the ruins rapidly narrowed.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his Thunder Escape technique, rushing out of the ruins. Then he withdrew his phoenix wings, flew out of the turbulent currents, and instead of leaving immediately, he quietly landed on a nearby island.</p><p>The cultivators on the island were completely unaware of the newcomer in their midst.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head, gazing into the sky.</p><p>A moment later, the grotesque-faced cultivator and the gray-robed figure flew out of the turbulent currents together.  These two were truly shady characters, deliberately using secret techniques to conceal themselves.</p><p>Of course, their movements couldn't escape the Sky-Eye Butterfly's gaze.</p><p>However, it wasn't wise to openly follow Grand Cultivators outside.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced in the direction they had fled, remaining where he was, still watching the entrance to the Forgotten Palace, waiting for Su Zinan to emerge.</p><p>He had a feeling that Su Zinan's purpose wasn't so simple.</p><p>Before entering, could Su Zinan have been completely unaware of the variables within the ruins?  To expend such vast effort, making such a grand display to open the Forgotten Palace, only to wander around the periphery?</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>The black hole in the sky reappeared, still spewing forth endless turbulent currents.  But as the black hole gradually shrunk, the area it affected became smaller and smaller.</p><p>Most of the cultivators had successfully escaped.</p><p>The escaping lights became increasingly sparse.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>Three escaping lights lit up within the black hole. One of them was Su Zinan.</p><p>After they escaped, a few more cultivators flew out, until the black hole completely closed.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't guarantee their safety within the Forgotten Palace ruins. He wondered if anyone had failed to escape in time, perishing within.</p><p>The last wave of turbulent currents surged into the sea, then weakened and was swallowed by the waves.</p><p>The various strange phenomena caused by the ruins subsided.  In an instant, the sky cleared, the sun shone brightly, and both the sky and the sea became tranquil, with no sign of chaos.</p><p>The Forgotten Palace ruins vanished, leaving behind only a few disfigured islands as its sole trace.</p><p>Su Zinan hovered in midair.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, the Wailing Spirit Cave Master, and other helpers Su Zinan had invited gradually gathered around him.</p><p>Glancing at the people beside him, Su Zinan's face suddenly darkened.</p><p>A burst of clamor arose from the observing crowd.</p><p>Su Zinan, dressed in white, had crossed south into the Central Plains. Two Nascent Soul stage Nether Moon Guards had always acted as his escorts, following him closely. Now, one was missing!</p><p>One Nether Moon Guard had actually perished in the Forgotten Palace. This trip had truly been a loss for Su Zinan.</p><p>Su Zinan forced out a drop of essence blood, drawing a blood talisman in the air, and pressed his hand forward.</p><p>The blood talisman glowed brightly, transforming into a streak of blood-red light. However, it swayed back and forth in midair, unable to sense the location of the other Nether Moon Seal.</p><p>This sea region was vast and empty, and only the Forgotten Palace could block such a connection.</p><p>Whether the Nether Moon Guard had been injured by the gray tide or killed by someone taking advantage of the chaos was impossible to determine.  The Nether Moon Guard's disappearance would remain an unsolved mystery.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Enraged, Su Zinan shattered the blood talisman with a single palm strike.</p><p>The others remained silent in fear.</p><p>Mo Xingdao stood quietly beside Su Zinan, his expression unchanged, as still as a deep well.</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master sighed.  "My condolences, Fellow Daoist Su."</p><p>"Their allotted lifespan has ended. Their death is not worth lamenting."</p><p>Su Zinan suppressed his anger and spoke indifferently, then raised his head, gazing at the empty void, lost in thought.</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master consoled him. "This failure is due to an inadequate assessment of the variables within the Forgotten Palace, not a defeat in battle. Does Fellow Daoist Su have any further plans?  When will we explore the Forgotten Palace again?"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a rapid sound of something breaking through the air came from the horizon.</p><p>Drawn by the sound, everyone looked towards the source and were surprised to discover that it was a snow-white crane rushing towards them.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators quickly noticed something unusual.</p><p>"It's one of the Eight Scenery secret techniques, the Nine Heavens Crane Flight!"</p><p>"Such speed, such high mastery.  Even within the Eight Scenery Pavilion, few possess such skill… Could it be Realist He Gao?"</p><p>"It is him!"</p><p>…</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the crane arrived, stopping abruptly in front of Su Zinan. Its wings folded, and a plume of white smoke arose, transforming into a long-bearded Daoist.</p><p>"Eh? It's him!"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled an encounter before entering the Central Prefecture.</p><p>Back then, he had been pursued by ferocious beasts. While fleeing, a cultivator from the Eight Scenery Pavilion appeared, leading the beasts away, and leaving behind a warning.  That cultivator had used this very escape technique.</p><p>Qin Sang later confirmed that the person should have been Realist He Gao of the Eight Scenery Pavilion.</p><p>Within the Eight Scenery Pavilion, his status below the Deity Transformation stage was second only to the sect leader, Realist Zi Lei.</p><p>"Realist, you're late."</p><p>A strange glint flashed in Su Zinan's eyes as he spoke indifferently.</p><p>Realist He Gao had a long and thin face with archaic features and narrow eyes as sharp as swords. He first looked up at the sky, then bowed to Su Zinan. "This poor Daoist is being presumptuous, but could Fellow Daoist Su inform me how to find the Forgotten Palace?"</p><p>Su Zinan patted his Mustard Seed Bag, and several pieces of broken wood flew out.  "As I said, Realist, you are a step too late.  My foster father left a marker within the Forgotten Palace.  It can be activated with a formation from the outside, thus locating the Forgotten Palace. Unfortunately, this marker can only be used once. This Su doesn't possess my foster father's great divine abilities to recreate the marker."</p><p>"What!"</p><p>Realist He Gao frowned deeply.  "It can only be used once? Why were you so reckless, Fellow Daoist, not consulting with us first?"</p><p>Su Zinan flew into a rage. "What my foster father left behind, this Su can use as he pleases.  What does it have to do with you!  I've heard that you lot bully others, and fellow Daoists in the Central Plains dare not speak out against you.  Others may fear you, but this Su does not!"</p><p>Snorting angrily, Su Zinan questioned loudly, "This Su personally visited your sect, asking Realist Dan Yu if he had ever entered the Forgotten Palace, requesting his guidance. Yet you all feigned ignorance, shutting this Su out. Now, this arrogance followed by servility, what is the reason!"</p><p>His voice boomed like thunder.</p><p>Every cultivator in the entire sea region could hear him clearly.</p><p>Even though he knew Su Zinan was spouting blatant lies in front of everyone, Realist He Gao couldn't refute him.  His face turned various shades of green and white.</p><p>Ignoring Realist He Gao's unsightly expression, Su Zinan turned and left, flicking his sleeves.</p><p>Su Zinan and his companions vanished into the horizon.</p><p>The cultivators below didn't leave, their expressions varied, pondering Su Zinan's words, secretly observing Realist He Gao.</p><p>Realist He Gao remained silent for a long while before he finally moved. He was still livid as he left.</p><p>Only after flying out of everyone's sight.</p><p>Did the anger on Realist He Gao's face suddenly disappear. He glanced in the direction Su Zinan had fled, his expression indifferent, and flew away gracefully.</p>
