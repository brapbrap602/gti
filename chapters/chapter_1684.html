<h1>Chapter 1675: The Crossing</h1><p>As time passed, the Tianhao Ancient Mirror no longer adhered to the surface of the seal, but was fully embedded within it, and continued to sink deeper.  The process was surprisingly smooth, eliciting no reaction or counterattack from the seal; it was as subtle as a spring rain nourishing all things, showcasing the mirror's extraordinary power.</p><p>When the Tianhao Ancient Mirror penetrated the interior of the seal, the sight that met the eye was unexpected.  It wasn't the vibrant colors they anticipated, but a world devoid of light.</p><p>Darkness. Oppression.</p><p>This sensation, transmitted to Fan Laomo's mind through the Tianhao Ancient Mirror, caused him to feel a sudden chill.</p><p>Soon, the Tianhao Ancient Mirror revealed that this wasn't pure darkness; there was a light source.  At the heart of the darkness, a single point of light flickered.</p><p>Its colors were five-fold, echoing the seal.</p><p>The Tianhao Ancient Mirror moved towards it, and the reflection of a five-colored crown appeared.</p><p>The mirror stopped beside the five-colored crown.  The spectral lotus within the mirror slowly drifted outwards.  As the lotus moved, its closed petals unfolded layer by layer, resuming its form as the Myriad Illusions Spectral Lotus.</p><p>A mass of dark energy surged within the lotus heart, gradually coalescing into a humanoid outline – Fan Laomo!</p><p>Fan Laomo's current state was peculiar. He hadn't entered in his physical form, but had used a secret technique to transform into a phantom body, attaching it to the mirror. He used the Tianhao Mirror as a vessel to bring this phantom body inside.</p><p>Though not his physical body, and thus subject to certain limitations, he could still utilize many of his abilities in this phantom form.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Fan Laomo opened his eyes, revealing black irises; within his pupils, it appeared as though two spectral lotuses bloomed.</p><p>“Is this the treasure?”</p><p>His black eyes moved, a hint of doubt in his gaze.  The place was a confluence of the five elements, the energy chaotic. His eyes fell upon the five-colored crown; he was about to analyze its structure when it suddenly vibrated.</p><p>Five-colored radiance instantly illuminated the surroundings. Fan Laomo had the sensation that the crown's form hadn't changed, yet it was completely different from before. A peerless treasure was awakening.</p><p>Indeed, Fan Laomo distinctly felt something stirring within the five-colored crown…</p><p>This something seemed to be… consciousness!</p><p>Consciousness… awakening?</p><p>The unprecedented sensation left Fan Laomo momentarily stunned, but then the feeling intensified, confirming it wasn't an illusion.  In a flash, possibly less, an even more profound sensation arose.</p><p>It was the feeling of being watched!</p><p>The source of this ‘gaze’ was the five-colored crown.</p><p>Though a phantom body is impervious to heat and cold, Fan Laomo shuddered violently. A wave of chill pierced his skull, nearly forcing a cry of alarm, “A spirit!”</p><p>A spirit!</p><p>The five-colored crown had actually birthed a spirit!</p><p>In fact, the Tianhao Ancient Mirror of Tianhao Tower and the Eight Scenery Palace Lamp of Eight Scenery View are both spiritual treasures.  The presence or absence of spiritual treasures to suppress the sect's destiny is a hallmark of top-tier sects; naturally, the Ganlu Zen Monastery wouldn't lack such treasures.</p><p>But spiritual treasures vary not only in power but also in strength.</p><p>Distinguishing the strength of spiritual treasures, their spiritual essence is a crucial factor.</p><p>When spiritual essence is cultivated to its peak, a spirit is born, marking another transformation of the treasure.</p><p>The Tianhao Ancient Mirror and Eight Scenery Palace Lamp have never directly clashed, and the two sects would not voluntarily reveal their secrets, but it can be said that they are still far from birthing a spirit.</p><p>The timescale is immeasurable – it could be hundreds or thousands of years, or perhaps they may never produce a spirit.</p><p>Because even when spiritual essence reaches its peak, it remains chaotic, and may not necessarily give birth to a spirit.  This stage is known as the "Spirit-Shaping Stage," a difficulty not unlike a cultivator breaking through a major cultivation bottleneck.</p><p>Even harder!</p><p>Of course, this information was obtained by Fan Laomo from ancient texts gathered from his sect.  Cultivators in the Central Plains are as numerous as the fish in the river, many attaining the Transformation God stage; yet there is no clear record of a spiritual treasure shaping a spirit.</p><p>In this world, few cultivators possess spiritual treasures. These Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators are still using various secret techniques to improve their natal treasures to pseudo-spiritual treasures, striving towards becoming true spiritual treasures.</p><p>Who would dare dream of the unattainable spirit?</p><p>At this moment, amidst his shock, Fan Laomo suddenly understood what the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect was suppressing with the seal on Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>It was to suppress a spirit!</p><p>Spiritual treasures will choose their master, requiring the "Treasure Communication Scripture" to control.  With a spirit present, how could it possibly submit to a cultivator's servitude?</p><p>In the past, the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect had several times used this treasure during the Demon Tribulation, always with the aid of powerful formations. Now that he considered it, each formation was different, yet all subtly conformed to the Dao of the Five Elements.</p><p>It was probably to control the treasure and suppress the spirit, preventing it from causing chaos.</p><p>In an instant, these thoughts flooded his mind, leaving Fan Laomo convinced he had grasped the truth. However, his mind remained tense, as he felt the spirit’s gaze upon him.</p><p>Suspicion</p><p>A palpable rage was evident.  This was the culmination of several failed plots, betrayals, and the realization that even his home had been compromised.  The spirit’s anger had built to a furious crescendo!</p><p>Feeling the intensity of this gaze, Fan Laomo’s heart pounded.  Seeing the jade pieces on the five-colored crown glow brightly, he felt an immediate sense of danger.</p><p>Without hesitation, he instinctively flung out his right hand. A stream of dark green light shot forth.  Within the light, one could see countless glittering, dark green grains of sand, each emitting a faint green glow like phosphorescent embers, chilling to the bone.</p><p>This was a treasure Fan Laomo had painstakingly crafted from various venomous substances.  It was called the Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand, specifically designed to corrupt magical artifacts.  When using his Illusory Demon form, he could temporarily transform a mentally linked artifact into a magical ability, bringing it into the battle.  His goal was to seize the treasure, to prevent the Wu family from controlling it and exponentially increasing their power. His first choice was naturally the Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand.</p><p>Although he hadn't anticipated encountering a spirit, this proved fortuitous. The Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand was perfectly timed. However, Fan Laomo wasn't certain how effective it would be against a spirit. He had no idea how powerful the five-colored crown, which housed the spirit, truly was.</p><p>He coveted the five-colored crown immensely, but understood the importance of acting within his limits. He wouldn't attempt a direct seizure; a slow, methodical approach was necessary.</p><p>Therefore, as the Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand was unleashed, Fan Laomo retreated rapidly towards the Myriad Illusions幽莲, unwilling to lose this illusory demon body here.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Fan Laomo was very close to the five-colored crown. The Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand instantly enveloped it, the fine sand transforming into specks of foul phosphorescent fire, clinging to the surface, leaving dark stains.</p><p>The five-colored crown's luster dimmed, tainted by the dark green, malevolent light.</p><p>But at that moment, Fan Laomo’s face contorted in shock.</p><p>Just as the Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand was about to strike the five-colored crown, a hidden black tide erupted from beneath it.  The surging black tide, carrying a terrifying demonic aura that even this powerful demon found chilling, violently assaulted the crown.</p><p>This impact caused the five-colored crown to violently shake, its five-colored light flickering. The spirit, caught off guard, was unable to react in time and was struck by the Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand.</p><p>The black tide was the true seal!</p><p>He had been used!</p><p>Fan Laomo was furious and filled with confusion.  He tried to recall the Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand, but it was too late.  Numerous questions flooded his mind.</p><p>What was the relationship between the spirit and the black tide? If the five-colored crown was part of a seal, why hadn't the spirit resisted or warned him when he was delving into the seal?</p><p>…</p><p>On Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang had cleverly misled the Poison King, drawing him away, while relentlessly pursuing the Kun Daoist.</p><p>The Sun God Tree and the Four-Ride Serpent Seal combined their power, delivering several powerful blows.  Despite the protective barrier, the Kun Daoist was severely injured, worsening her condition.  Simultaneously, she had to focus on expelling the sword intent Qin Sang had planted within her, leaving her barely able to defend herself, forced to flee.</p><p>Even without her physical presence, Qin Sang held a clear advantage, no longer needing to maintain the Gan Fire Shield, fighting with ease.</p><p>From outside the mountain, one could see bursts of colored smoke, red and black, erupting down the slopes of Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The Jinchen Sword hung inverted above Qin Sang’s head, its sword intent steadily accumulating, yet remaining unreleased.</p><p>Qin Sang wielded the Sun God Tree in one hand, while a demonic fire dragon coiled around the other, unleashing alternating attacks.</p><p>Ignoring her injuries, the Kun Daoist struggled to suppress and expel the sword intent. Finally, just before Qin Sang could force her true form to appear, she expelled the last vestiges of Qin Sang's sword intent.</p><p>Inwardly relieved, the Kun Daoist abruptly moved several dozen feet within the barrier.  Then she froze. The demonic fire dragon followed swiftly.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The violent impact, transmitted through the barrier, further wounded her already ravaged body.</p><p>It wasn't the sword intent!</p><p>How did he discover me?</p><p>The Kun Daoist was beside herself with rage, but Qin Sang didn't give her time to think. The demonic fire dragon pursued relentlessly, the increasing severity of her wounds a stark reminder that her physical form was nearing its limit.</p><p>“The time is right.”</p><p>Qin Sang had been continuously assessing the Kun Daoist’s condition.</p><p>The decision made, sword light erupted like a dragon.</p><p>Wherever the Jinchen Sword reached, a sword array reformed.</p><p>At that moment, unexpectedly, an enraged roar erupted from the barrier.  A figure flashed, and Kun Dao fell, eyes closed, lifeless.</p><p>Qin Sang barely avoided severing Kun Dao's body, swiftly diverting the demonic flames and retracting his sword energy.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A silken thread wrapped Kun Dao's corpse and drifted before Qin Sang.</p><p>"She's dead…"</p><p>After a brief check, Qin Sang confirmed Kun Dao's death, utterly bewildered.  He hadn't expected such decisiveness; she had committed suicide when the situation turned unfavorable. He had pursued her this far intending to capture her alive.</p><p>Regardless, his primary objective was achieved. Qin Sang looked to Kun Dao's waist, snatched a crimson jade pendant, and felt a surge of intense, fiery energy coursing through him, leaving him feeling flushed. Its power rivaled that of the mysterious ice disc.</p><p>"A fine treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed, his heart soaring.  He now possessed both of the most important artifacts from the tribulation formation.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang's spiritual sense swept over Kun Dao's body, but he found no storage pouches. Had she found nothing in the medicinal garden?  Considering these inconsistencies, Qin Sang grew suspicious, increasingly convinced that Kun Dao's suicide was not what it seemed.</p><p>Just then, another roar echoed.</p><p>The source of the sound was unclear. It seemed to emanate from the mountaintop, yet also from the barrier itself.  Though not loud, it was undeniable, carrying a furious rage that sent shivers down one's spine.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, his brow furrowed.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't the only one startled by the roar.</p><p>Behind Qin Sang's main body…</p><p>The Poison King, pursuing the decoy, quickly realized he'd been tricked.  Sensing the commotion created by Qin Sang's main body in the distance, he turned to leave.  The decoy served more than just a distraction.</p><p>As the Poison King moved, a chilling presence washed over him. He spun around to see a venomous serpent, wreathed in icy flames, tearing through the wind, lunging at him.</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>The Poison King's face darkened.  The poisonous clouds surrounding him coalesced above his head, meeting the serpent's attack.  Instantly, the Poison King sensed something was wrong, and hastily summoned poisonous sand, launching it at the cloud. The cloud retracted, becoming several times denser.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>The serpent collided with the cloud. The poisonous cloud violently vibrated, almost torn apart, but the poisonous sand maintained its structure.  The outer layer of poison mist, however, froze into oddly colored ice under the icy flames.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ice shattered, and the poisonous sand, carrying the remaining cloud, rebounded.</p><p>The Poison King gracefully retreated several dozen meters, his phoenix eyes narrowed as he saw the decoy returning from the depths of the wind.</p><p>"A spiritual treasure?"</p><p>The Poison King first noticed the four-serpent mark on the decoy's head.  Central Plains spiritual treasures were few in number.</p><p>The Poison King mentally reviewed them, but didn't recognize this one.  The relevant scriptures of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect made no mention of it. Although the cultivator was only at the mid-Yuan Ying stage, possessing such a treasure made them formidable.</p><p>But why did a mid-Yuan Ying stage helper suddenly appear beside Qin Sang?</p><p>Recalling the abrupt energy fluctuations he'd sensed near Qin Sang, the Poison King's expression changed.  "This is… your clone? No, a separate incarnation!"</p><p>The seamless energy of the incarnation was far beyond that of a mere clone.</p><p>This explained everything.  The rebel's defeat was understandable given the cultivator's extraordinary strength and a separate incarnation wielding a spiritual treasure.</p><p>"First a late Yuan Ying puppet, now a separate incarnation… this place truly hides dragons and tigers…"</p><p>The Poison King chuckled, "Do you think one incarnation can stop me?"</p><p>His identity revealed, the incarnation made no further pretense, but was content to engage the Poison King, buying time for the main body.  He calmly said, "Poison King, why push things so far?"</p><p>"I only ask for an answer…"</p><p>The Poison King reiterated his offer of a substantial reward.</p><p>"Once this matter is settled, and my main body has time, I will contact you…"</p><p>The incarnation's words were cut short by the Poison King.</p><p>"Since the incarnation can't decide, I shall ask your main body directly," the Poison King roared, instantly transforming into a streak of light and fleeing.</p><p>The Poison King realized the other party had little interest in returning the Gu King. Stopping now was futile.  Waiting for the other party to resolve their issues, return laden with spoils, and then leisurely deal with the Gu King? Or begging for a handout?</p><p>Only by creating more problems could he seize the initiative!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>As the light appeared, the serpent struck.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Poison King abruptly stopped, feigning retreat, turning to face the incarnation, and lunging back with even greater speed.</p><p>The incarnation was prepared, his eyes gleaming white.  A bone-chilling white light flashed from before him, as his figure recoiled.</p><p>The icy light formed a barrier like an ice wall, a swift and decisive defense, regardless of any danger. The incarnation exercised extreme caution, preventing the Poison King from using that worm-like Gu insect, only harassing him from a distance with the spiritual treasure and icy light, never getting close.</p><p>He couldn't stop the Poison King, but he could buy time.</p><p>Until the roar echoed, causing both to stop, surprised.</p>
