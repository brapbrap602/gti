<h1>Chapter 1213: Escape</h1><p>After the great battle at Ziwei Palace, many cultivators, witnessing the power of the Blood-Pollution Light, desired a piece of the Intermittent Blood Mulberry to refine into magical treasures.  Xiao Hanyu searched the Boundless Valley many times, finding nothing. He suspected the Blood Mulberries had all been gathered by the Sin Abyss and eventually gave up the search.</p><p>The Intermittent Blood Mulberry was a fleeting phenomenon. Over the years, even Jiang Chenzi and the others had gradually forgotten about it.  Unexpectedly, the Blood-Pollution Light reappeared here, used against them.  Truly, the cycle of heaven and retribution is inescapable.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Blood-Pollution Light, seemingly slow yet swift, drifted down onto the magic banner.  Jiang Chenzi was too late to retract it, watching helplessly as the banner trembled and dimmed in an instant.  Three magic banners were essential; with one polluted, the spirit array inevitably faltered.</p><p>“No good!”</p><p>They hadn’t anticipated Qin Sang’s move. Jiang Chenzi frantically poured his true essence into the teetering banner, attempting to salvage it.</p><p>Ye Laomo appeared above the blood pool, just as he was about to begin refining the Lu cultivator and the ice lizard. Sensing the damage to the array, Ye Laomo frowned slightly, showing displeasure but remaining calm, neither surprised nor urgent.  He gently raised his hand towards Qin Sang.</p><p>At that moment, a change occurred within the blood pool.</p><p>A roar, unlike any human sound, echoed from the depths.  The sound was incredibly sharp, filled with pain, like demonic music assaulting the ears.  Those who heard it involuntarily frowned, feeling intensely uncomfortable.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A powerful force exploded violently, the blood surging back.  Simultaneously, a terrible chill emanated from it.  Some of the bizarre blood was frozen into ice by the icy wind.</p><p>A sphere shining with blue light rose slowly from the center of the explosion. It looked like the snow pearl the ice lizard had previously used, but the chill it radiated was far stronger.</p><p>A colossal ice lizard, dozens of meters long, raised its head, the snow pearl atop its head.  Its limbs, like giant pillars, broke through the river of blood.  Its eyes, filled with rage, coldly fixed on Ye Laomo.</p><p>Under the ice lizard's gaze, Ye Laomo felt a tightening in his chest. His calm expression flickered, revealing a hint of surprise.</p><p>Of the four who entered the Abyssal Ruins,</p><p>the Lu cultivator and the Snake King were both mid-Yuan Ying stage experts.  Qin Sang had the lowest cultivation, but his magical abilities and treasures were not lacking at all; he was actually the most highly regarded.  Only the ice lizard, only in the early stage of transformation, seemed unremarkable and insignificant.</p><p>But this ice lizard was a complete surprise.  Not only had its size increased dramatically, becoming incredibly powerful and ferocious, but the aura it emitted was also vastly different, making even Ye Laomo wary.</p><p>Ye Laomo’s gaze shifted, falling on the area beneath the ice lizard. He finally found the Lu cultivator.</p><p>In stark contrast to the ice lizard, the Lu cultivator’s face was pale, his breath shallow and weak, his injuries appearing to have suddenly worsened, more severe than before.</p><p>The Lu cultivator and Ye Laomo exchanged a gaze; both appeared unusually calm, not as if they were fighting for their lives.</p><p>“What kind of secret technique is this? It seems the Lu cultivator has poured all his cultivation into the ice lizard…”</p><p>Ye Laomo instantly guessed the reason for this transformation.  The ice lizard and the Lu cultivator had remained inactive until now, likely preparing for this technique.  What puzzled him, however, was that there were no markings of the Lu cultivator on the ice lizard—it wasn’t his spirit beast—yet it was proficient in this combined attack technique.</p><p>This thought vanished instantly, as Ye Laomo heard the ice lizard's roar and sensed danger. He immediately retracted his hand from Qin Sang and pressed it towards the snow pearl.</p><p>Simultaneously, the snow pearl erupted in brilliant light, like a幽蓝大日 (a large blue sun).</p><p>Ye Laomo’s expression was grave.  He spread his five fingers wide, and delicate threads of blood shot out from his fingertips, engulfing the blood below before rapidly solidifying into a strange blood-colored diagram.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>As the blood diagram formed, the blue sun slammed into it.  Blood light and icy light collided and intertwined, their shockwaves spreading out, creating chaos. Nothing was visible, including the Lu cultivator and the ice lizard.</p><p>Ye Laomo’s figure flickered, forced to rise, temporarily avoiding the brunt of the attack. The ice lizard’s current strength was clearly evident.</p><p>On the other side…</p><p>After Qin Sang damaged a vital banner, creating a weakness in the protective formation, he and the Serpent King used their magic weapons to fight off Jiang Chenzi and his allies, then charged out together.</p><p>Sensing the terrifying energy below and witnessing the entire sequence through his magical insect, Qin Sang was slightly startled. He hadn't expected them to have such a move.</p><p>Sure enough, these cultivators and powerful demons all held secret trump cards.</p><p>However, it remained uncertain whether the Lu cultivator and the ice lizard, one heavily wounded and the other having forcibly enhanced their abilities using a forbidden technique, would have the strength to escape the ensuing pursuit.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Serpent King exchanged a look.</p><p>Qin Sang proceeded with their original plan—to the Tian Shi Sect's headquarters.</p><p>Although the blood barrier would be breached by the ice lizard, Ye Laomo seemed unharmed and still powerful.</p><p>Heading downwards, they still had to face Ye Laomo and overcome the evil spirits, risking the failure of their entire endeavor.</p><p>This was for the best.</p><p>Barring unforeseen circumstances, the ice lizard and the Lu cultivator should break through the blood barrier and escape the abyssal chasm, while they would take a detour via the Tian Shi Sect.</p><p>Splitting up would divide the abyss's forces.</p><p>As for the evil spirits, Qin Sang already had a plan.</p><p>Having spent several days searching for the fragments of the killing sword in the abyssal chasm, Qin Sang was now very familiar with the ancient barriers there, knowing the route and several points where he could leverage them.</p><p>Though he couldn't kill the spirits, he could trap them momentarily and shake them off.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>The Serpent King said in a low voice, echoing Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>His decision to aid Qin Sang was carefully considered; it wasn't a betrayal of their companions or using the ice lizard and the Lu cultivator as bait.</p><p>If he had charged downwards immediately and coordinated with the ice lizard, it would seemingly have been easier to force back Ye Laomo and break the blood river's blockade.</p><p>However, if Qin Sang had failed to break Jiang Chenzi's formation, and Ye Laomo had received the assistance of three more cultivators, the power of the blood river would have been far greater.</p><p>Once the full might of the formation was unleashed, they would all become trapped.</p><p>This way, the four could successfully break free, escaping separately. Whether they could survive the subsequent pursuit was entirely up to their individual capabilities.</p><p>Then, without looking back, they flew deeper into the chasm with the evil spirits in tow.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi, enraged, joined the other two cultivators in a final desperate attempt to delay them.  However, the earlier breach of the formation had given Qin Sang and the Serpent King the upper hand, making it too late to stop them.</p><p>Qin Sang was skilled in escape techniques, and the Serpent King's cultivation was second only to Ye Laomo's; his speed was naturally high as well.</p><p>With a display of effortless skill, they easily repelled the hasty attacks launched by Jiang Chenzi and his allies.</p><p>With a few swift movements, Qin Sang and the Serpent King broke through all obstacles and entered the gap in the dark clouds.</p><p>The Serpent King, unfamiliar with the route, followed closely behind Qin Sang.</p><p>They fought off the evil spirits' attacks while flying towards the Tian Shi Sect's headquarters.</p>
