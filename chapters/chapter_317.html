<h1>Chapter 310 Spoils of War</h1><p>Sealing the cave, Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the ice bed, examining his body. The injuries sustained at Autumn Abundance Market had mostly healed, leaving no lasting effects on his cultivation.</p><p>His core remained as it was.</p><p>He had long accepted that the damage to his foundation wouldn't heal naturally, placing his hopes on the Profound Mark Harmony Pill to resolve this hidden danger.</p><p>He also wondered if the Nine Flowers Azure Frost Grass could heal Yun Youzi's spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from meditation, staring at the rough stone ceiling above, lost in thought for a moment. He reached into his robe, pulling out Luo Xingnan's storage pouch.</p><p>Ge Yuan's possessions, aside from the Blue Dew昙 Flower, included two valuable magical artifacts given to Shangguan Lifeng. The remaining items were of little worth.</p><p>The real prize lay with Luo Xingnan.</p><p>First was the Silver Knife Talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the cracks on the talisman, sensing its remaining power.  Luo Xingnan's decisive final struggle, fully activating the talisman, had greatly depleted its energy.</p><p>Used sparingly, it could be activated twice more in a less intense battle. Against a strong opponent in a protracted fight, a single use might exhaust it completely.</p><p>Having lost the Jade Ruyi but gaining this Silver Knife Talisman, though damaged, somewhat offset the loss; something was better than nothing.</p><p>Comparatively, Qin Sang found the Yin-Yang Compass to be the most useful.</p><p>Undoubtedly a top-tier artifact, its function was unique. While the compass's magnetic aura offered some protection, its primary purpose wasn't offense or defense.</p><p>Crafted from a unique magnetic stone, the compass emitted alternating Yin and Yang auras, creating powerful repulsive (black) and attractive (white) forces, as evidenced by Ge Yuan's fate.</p><p>The magnetic forces, controlled at will, offered boundless versatility, especially in complex battles, disrupting enemy formations with unpredictable effects.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang wouldn't overlook such an artifact. After refining it for his own use, he flicked a finger, dislodging a stone chip from the wall.</p><p>The compass's alternating aura sent the chip flying up and down, initially clumsily, then with increasing fluidity.</p><p>After practicing, Qin Sang stored the compass within his body for continuous refinement.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's other artifacts, though less impressive than the Yin-Yang Compass, each had unique uses.  Qin Sang, lacking artifacts, categorized and stored them carefully. He didn't find the jade fork, likely destroyed during the Serpent's attack.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's spirit stones, totaling just over a thousand low-grade stones, were meager. As a rogue cultivator, he invested most of his resources in artifacts, pills, and talismans to enhance his strength. </p><p>Such cultivators rarely accumulated vast wealth without a fortunate windfall.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang placed two jade boxes before him.</p><p>One held the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom, the other the Blue Dew昙 Flower.</p><p>Qin Sang had already consulted Yun Youzi about their properties.</p><p>Both were thousand-year-old spirit herbs, but the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom was intrinsically more valuable. However, for Ge Yuan, the Blue Dew昙 Flower, essential for crafting Dew Cleansing Pills when combined with other herbs, was priceless.  The other ingredients, though valuable, weren't as rare as the Blue Dew昙 Flower, and could be found with patience.</p><p>This pill, when taken by cultivators practicing Wood element techniques, refined their spiritual energy, aiding in overcoming bottlenecks, particularly during Foundation Establishment. Its effect on Core Formation was supposedly minimal, but still highly sought after.</p><p>Unlike those cultivating techniques like the "Primordial Spirit Nurturing Sword Scripture," who relied on comprehending Death symbols for breakthroughs, most cultivators faced arduous bottlenecks. Some, like Yu Daiyue, could be trapped for decades.</p><p>Reaching the Pseudo Core Formation stage early allowed ample time to prepare for Core Formation, a significant advantage.</p><p>Qin Sang's foundation was built upon the Water element technique, "Netherworld Scripture."  His later techniques, "Mystical Womb Jade Cauldron Scripture" and "Primordial Spirit Nurturing Sword Scripture," were attributeless, continuing to rely on Water element energy. He had no need for Dew Cleansing Pills.</p><p>Thus, the Blue Dew昙 Flower was of little use to him.</p><p>However, for Wood element cultivators, it was indispensable, explaining Ge Yuan's desperation. Sadly, he never benefited from it.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to trade it at an opportune moment.</p><p>He shifted his gaze to the other box.</p><p>The Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom, a palm-sized, lingzhi-shaped fungus, was striking for its intense blood-red color.</p><p>The interwoven mycelia resembled blood vessels, engorged and pulsating as if about to bleed.  These mycelia formed a ghost-like pattern on the surface, enhancing its macabre appearance, hence its name.</p><p>The most valuable of the seven herbs, it could be directly refined and absorbed, boosting cultivation.</p><p>Combined with Heartless Orchid and five other herbs, it formed the Blood Weeping Pill, benefiting even Core Formation cultivators.  However, these other herbs were equally valuable and rare. Gathering the ingredients for a Blood Weeping Pill was nearly impossible in the current cultivation world.</p><p>Unless he encountered a Core Formation cultivator preparing to refine this pill, its trade value would be limited.</p><p>Qin Sang's best option was direct refinement.</p><p>According to Yun Youzi, directly refining the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom, despite significant potency loss compared to the Profound Mark Harmony Pill, could save a decade of cultivation.</p><p>Contemplating the mushroom, Qin Sang decided against refining it for now. The Profound Mark Harmony Pill's efficacy on his foundation was uncertain. If it failed, he'd need to convert its energy to boost his cultivation.</p><p>His cultivation wasn't freely controllable, restricted by Death symbols.  If the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom boosted his cultivation prematurely, without time to comprehend the corresponding symbols, the Profound Mark Harmony Pill's potency would be wasted.</p><p>The mushroom could wait.</p><p>Storing the herbs, Qin Sang retrieved Luo Xingnan's corpse, the Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle, and the Five Element Yin materials, preparing to refine them into a Malignant Corpse.</p><p>A Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivator's corpse, when refined, could rival a Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator in battle.</p>
