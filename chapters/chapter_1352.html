<h1>Chapter 1344: No Match</h1><p>The ebony sword reaped a swarm of wraiths, then whirled back.  </p><p>Under the cover of the sword light, something silently dropped into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>Simultaneously, a whisper-like voice reached his ears.</p><p>Qin Sang paused.</p><p>Others noticed the change.</p><p>Grandmaster Cang Hong asked with concern, “Daoist Friend Qin, what is it?”</p><p>“The Blood Infant's counterattack is becoming increasingly ferocious,”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, concealing the truth.</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he looked into the depths of the ghost mist. The surrounding space was again filled with countless wraiths and ghosts.  The voice was Bai's, but he wasn't sure from which direction it came.</p><p>Bai was acting very cautiously, guarding against something.</p><p>Cang Hong, unsuspicious, showed a worried expression, nodding and saying, “After the giant explosion, the number of blood clouds and wraiths has increased.  Elder Ye has obviously noticed us. His intentions are clear—to stop us from approaching the altar. That explosion was earth-shattering; the strange phenomenon in the inner hall must have escalated to an extremely intense level.  Without a doubt, Elder Ye's plot is about to surface…”</p><p>Qin Sang listened silently, neither confirming nor denying.</p><p>A flicker of unusual color flashed in his eyes. He clenched his hand; the touch was icy. A thin rope appeared in his palm.</p><p>Bai had used a wraith to secretly return the Soulbinding Rope!</p><p>Then, Qin Sang, appearing as if nothing had happened, continued to lead the way on his sword, though he was now on high alert.</p><p>Heavy blood clouds.</p><p>Ghostly howls.</p><p>As Grandmaster Cang Hong predicted, they drew most of the power of the evil formation; more and more wraiths and ghosts were driven towards them by Elder Ye.</p><p>They were completely surrounded by the blood clouds, a sea of red within their vision, impossibly thick, obscuring everything.  Combined with the endless ghosts and wraiths, they felt like they'd been thrown into a bloody hell, the pressure mounting.</p><p>The blood clouds followed their movements, like living things, constantly swirling.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A Nascent Soul puppet dispersed a clump of blood clouds, its momentum fierce, charging forward.</p><p>This scene had repeated countless times; nothing unusual.</p><p>Their ability to move so fast was largely due to the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>But at that moment, ever-vigilant Qin Sang's pupils suddenly constricted, a warning flaring in his heart. Without hesitation, he unleashed a long-prepared sword technique.</p><p>‘Buzz!’</p><p>The sword's hum shook the heavens!</p><p>Everyone was startled, looking towards Qin Sang. The ebony sword's light was like a dragon, its energy cleaving the air; countless wraiths and ghosts were instantly annihilated.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sword light, dazzling to the extreme, slashed towards the void in front of Qin Sang!</p><p>Everyone was surprised, but before they could understand what was happening, a sudden change occurred. The thick blood clouds roared down, engulfing countless wraiths and ghosts, and fiercely charged into the group!</p><p>Chaos reigned.</p><p>For a time, maintaining their footing was difficult; their formation instantly crumbled, swallowed by the blood clouds, scrambling to activate their treasures for defense.</p><p>Before Qin Sang.</p><p>Sword light tore through the air, descending from the heavens.</p><p>Within the sword light, a figure quietly emerged – Yu Gu!</p><p>Yu Gu turned his neck; his bones creaked with a ‘crack, crack’ sound.  He raised a hand, effortlessly blocking the sword light. The ghost fire in his eye sockets conveyed a contemptuous expression, “Heh, a mere early Nascent Soul cultivator. You can see through my concealment technique. No wonder that Ye boy is so wary of you.”</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression remained calm; he coldly questioned.</p><p>Seeing Yu Gu's appearance, a chill ran down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>The Blood Lake battle…it was unclear whether Yu Gu had faked his death or if a demon from the Crime God Palace had been reborn using his body.</p><p>Yu Gu's flesh had completely dried up, resembling a skeleton, yet he still lived, and his power was terrifying. Even with Bai’s warning and preparation, Qin Sang had barely managed to draw his sword in time.</p><p>His mind was taut, the hand gripping the Soulbinding Rope nearly sweating.</p><p>As expected, the sword attack did not inflict the slightest damage on Yu Gu.</p><p>As he asked the question, Qin Sang didn't hesitate; his sword technique shifted, the ebony sword forming a sword array, instantly shrouding the void in darkness.</p><p>“Looking for death!”</p><p>Sensing the sword array’s fluctuations, the ghost fire in Yu Gu’s eye sockets violently pulsed, his rage immense. He roared, his figure vanishing into thin air.</p><p>The next instant, countless shadowy bone claws erupted!</p><p>‘Bang bang bang…’</p><p>Qin Sang's face was filled with astonishment.</p><p>Yu Gu's techniques were unlike anything he'd ever seen. Even with his enhanced vision, he could barely distinguish reality from illusion.  But this was meaningless; he couldn't react fast enough, couldn't keep up with the shifting claw shadows, let alone counter them.</p><p>Qin Sang fought with all his might, constantly shifting his formations, but to little effect.  Sword beams extinguished one after another.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>His ebony sword cried out in protest, nearly knocked from his grasp by the immense force.</p><p>In an instant, a subtle distortion appeared in the void before Qin Sang. A bone claw shot out, radiating a chilling aura capable of freezing a person solid, aimed directly at his forehead!</p><p>"I'm not even a match for him in a single exchange!"  Qin Sang thought.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Thunder roared.</p><p>His phoenix wings unfurled with a *whoosh*.  Lightning crackled between the feathers, illuminating their breathtaking beauty.  </p><p>Qin Sang transformed into a streak of lightning, retreating rapidly.</p><p>*Sizzle!*</p><p>The bone claw easily pierced the image of Qin Sang's head, but no blood spilled; it was merely an afterimage.  Unrelenting, the ghostly claw pursued Qin Sang without pause, intent on tearing him apart, its speed exceeding even Qin Sang's lightning escape.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sharp pain in his forehead.</p><p>Just then...</p><p>Two vortexes emerged from the blood clouds, simultaneously revealing two figures:  Master Cang Hong and Master Zhen Yi! They were the first to break free from the blood clouds and, witnessing Qin Sang being hunted by Yu Gu, were stunned by the latter's power.</p><p>"Heaven-Breaking Finger!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's perilous situation, Master Cang Hong hesitated not at all. His eyelids drooped as he silently chanted an incantation, his hands weaving a complex seal.  A circle of green light, vibrant and alive, surrounded him.  Within the green light, a rootless vine sprouted from the void, climbing up Master Cang Hong's body to his head, its leaves swaying gently. The vine's main body was hidden beneath layers of leaves that formed a green armor.</p><p>The blood clouds and ghostly specters attacked furiously, shattering countless leaves, but the green light flashed, and new leaves instantly grew back, preventing them from approaching.  The vine was clearly a powerful protective treasure.</p><p>Master Cang Hong, safe within its protection, focused on his spell, exuding an ancient and awe-inspiring aura.  A blinding white light erupted behind him.</p><p>In an instant, the light dissipated, revealing a colossal figure – a gigantic spectral projection of Master Cang Hong himself.  The spectral image towered a hundred meters high, reaching towards the heavens. (To be continued)</p>
