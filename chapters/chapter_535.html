<h1>Chapter 528:  Borrowing a Knife to Kill</h1><p>Seeing the two figures approaching, Qin Sang sensed their cultivation wasn't high.  Activating the Ebony Sword, he had a chance to escape.</p><p>But this was the most crucial moment of condensing his Core with罡煞 energy. Using the Ebony Sword now would deplete his energy, potentially disrupting the balance of the three forces and ruining his efforts.</p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>If he still didn't realize the phenomenon was caused by the Azure Yang罡 Essence in his hand, he'd be a fool. Clearly, Divine罡 Peak held secrets he wasn't privy to!</p><p>Such a violent Ancestral Saintfire, contained at the peak, was likely connected to these jade-like pieces of Azure Yang罡 Essence.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the thread-like stream of fire slowly drifting closer.</p><p>After the initial shock, he calmed down, realizing this wasn't the main body of the Ancestral Saintfire, but merely a manifestation of its power leaking out.</p><p>The formation sealing the Saintfire wasn't easily damaged. The main body remained firmly confined to the summit.</p><p>Not the main body – good. While this power was still formidable, it offered some room to maneuver!</p><p>An idea struck Qin Sang. He made a decision, slamming his hand onto the ground, grabbing the remaining Azure Yang罡 Essence!</p><p>The piece, already mostly absorbed, shattered with a crisp crack in his hand.</p><p>Immediately, strands of incredibly dense罡 energy surged from his fingers, swiftly absorbed into his body!</p><p>The two Azure Yang Devil Sect cultivators heard the shattering sound and their faces changed drastically.</p><p>"Insolent!"</p><p>"Audacious!"</p><p>Enraged, they rushed forward, seeing only a figure hidden in a crevice, back to them, completely ignoring their warnings, focused on absorbing the罡 Essence.</p><p>Even without seeing his face, they knew this person, destroying the罡 Essence, wasn't one of their own!</p><p>Someone was stealing the Azure Yang罡 Essence!</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Shocked, they demanded, unable to believe an outsider had infiltrated their sacred Divine罡 Peak!</p><p>If not for this person damaging the罡 Essence and triggering the phenomenon, the entire sect would remain oblivious.</p><p>The figure remained unresponsive, still absorbing the Azure Yang罡 energy, the concentration around his fingers intensifying.</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>They roared, exchanging glances, then activated their Azure Yang Devilfire. Two spears of devilfire, like twin azure dragons, shot towards Qin Sang's back.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The fire spears were incredibly fast. Qin Sang, seemingly defenseless, was about to be impaled.</p><p>Suddenly, he moved.</p><p>The crevice was within a massive black stone, split in two but not fallen apart, creating a winding passage.</p><p>The Azure Yang罡 Essence was embedded in the ground within this crevice.</p><p>Still clutching the fragments, Qin Sang sprang forward in a seated position, like a frog, easily evading the spears and darting deeper into the crevice.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>The two cultivators wouldn't let him escape. They pursued him relentlessly.</p><p>However, just as they passed Qin Sang's previous spot, a piercing sword cry echoed from within the crevice, followed by a flash of sword light.</p><p>The sword light charged towards them.</p><p>Sensing its power, the two cultivators paled.</p><p>"A magic treasure!"</p><p>They cried out, hastily throwing their devilfire to intercept the sword and retreating.</p><p>They hadn't sensed any formidable aura from Qin Sang, never expecting him to wield a magic treasure.  At their level of cultivation, they wouldn't dare clash directly with a magic treasure.</p><p>Then, a surprising scene unfolded.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The flying sword and their Azure Yang Devilfire collided.</p><p>With a 'clang', the sword was knocked back, seemingly powerless, tumbling to the ground before rising unsteadily, flying back.</p><p>They thought they were seeing things, realizing the sword was a mere facade!</p><p>Only its material lived up to its status as a magic treasure, its body unharmed after enduring the impact of two devilfire spears.</p><p>Their faces shifted between anger and embarrassment.</p><p>Suddenly, something felt wrong. They looked up, their expressions freezing.</p><p>The swirling vortex above was rapidly descending, its center directly above them, right where the罡 Essence had been.</p><p>The fire stream within the vortex had vanished.</p><p>The vortex was filled with dense azure light, fluctuating with chaotic wind, clouds, and lightning, resembling flickering azure flames.</p><p>The azure light and the vortex descended with terrifying force, instantly shattering the black stone around the crevice.</p><p>Immense pressure descended. The two cultivators felt trapped, unable to move!</p><p>"No! Deploy the fire banner!"</p><p>One shouted.</p><p>The other reacted, pulling out a man-sized triangular azure banner from their storage pouch and planting it between them. They then poured their Azure Yang Devilfire into the banner.</p><p>The banner depicted a devilfire-like pattern. As the real devilfire flowed in, the pattern came alive.</p><p>They had no time for Qin Sang, their priority was survival.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The fire banner blazed, releasing a fiery shield, enveloping them.</p><p>The next moment, the azure light struck, obliterating the surrounding terrain. Its power was evident.</p><p>Only a massive swirling vortex remained, churning debris, obscuring its center.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the vortex's edge.</p><p>Just the residual power of the Ancestral Saintfire manifested as azure light had caused such destruction!</p><p>Qin Sang was now certain the Ancestral Saintfire and Azure Yang Devilfire shared the same origin. The two cultivators, protected by the fire banner, survived.</p><p>Qin Sang, lacking Azure Yang Devilfire, couldn't force his way into the azure light without risking provoking the Ancestral Saintfire.</p><p>However, as long as the azure light remained, they were trapped and couldn't send any messages.</p>
