<h1>Chapter 1789: Observations at the Ritual Altar</h1><p>When Qin Sang and the other three arrived, they found only the rubble of a collapsed golden hall.  Dust still hung in the air.  The remnants suggested a large protective array had been forcefully breached.  It was unclear what method the demon lords had used, as there had been no prior fluctuations before the array shattered instantly.  For countless years, most of the golden halls had been explored.  Those remaining were either extremely well-hidden or impossible for ordinary cultivators to breach.</p><p>The four quickly scanned the ruins with their spiritual senses.  Only broken bricks and tiles remained; the demon lords had plundered all the treasures within.</p><p>“What was that golden light that flew out first? Could it have been the sacred treasure this hall enshrined?”  Yuhuang Zhenren looked around, questioning.</p><p>The devastation was too severe to determine the hall's original purpose, making the origin of the golden light impossible to ascertain.  However, Qin Sang and the others thought Yuhuang Zhenren's guess was likely correct.  The golden light was probably the demon lords' objective, otherwise they wouldn't have pursued it into the Nine-curve Star River.</p><p>Having escaped the Demon Lord's encirclement, the golden light was likely a highly spiritual treasure, perhaps even possessing a spirit!  At the very least, it was connected to the secrets deep within the Jushan Ritual Altar.</p><p>They had yet to see the treasure itself and felt no greed for something hypothetical, but the current situation was undeniably advantageous.</p><p>“The demon lords’ escape speeds vary.  Their pursuit of the golden light into the Star River, fraught with dangers ahead, will force them to disperse. This is a good opportunity,” Guyun Zhenren said gravely.</p><p>Everyone looked towards the Nine-curve Star River.  The demon lords and the golden light were both out of sight.  The extraordinary spectacle of the countless lights in the Star River was waning.</p><p>To take advantage of the chaos, they too would have to venture deep into the Jushan Ritual Altar, inevitably incurring some risk.</p><p>Both Zhenrens looked to Zhijian Zhenren, the initiator of this operation.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself: regardless of the power of Tianmu Die’s new abilities after its advancement, its innate celestial eye abilities would surely have greatly improved.  The more complex the situation and protective arrays, the more useful she would be. Tianmu Die’s warnings could help avoid most dangers.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren looked to him for his opinion. Qin Sang nodded slightly, agreeing with Guyun Zhenren's proposal.</p><p>The four then flew towards the Nine-curve Star River.  As they approached, they sensed two approaching auras – Zhang Zhenren and Zhenru Zunzhe.</p><p>The six gathered on the banks of the Star River.</p><p>Only upon closer inspection did they realize that the Star River was comprised of real flowing water, yet it flowed upwards from a low point, culminating in a waterfall cascading heavenwards.  The starlight was like fish in the river. When Tianmu Die used its celestial eye ability to penetrate the water, all they saw was emptiness.</p><p>However, those who had entered the Nine-curve Star River knew the starlight concealed danger, necessitating a swift passage to avoid being approached.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren’s serious expression when mentioning this filled Qin Sang with caution.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>They leaped into the Star River, causing waves and a distinct sound of rushing water.  The water was chilling, and soon they saw luminous spots approaching.  Initially, only a few nearby, but soon they swarmed from all sides.  The countless specks were like voracious man-eating fish, chilling even these powerful cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Lotus Seal, stepping on a lotus flower, nimbly dodging the approaching lights.  He appeared relaxed, though this was merely a facade.  Upon reaching the other side of the Nine-curve Star River, he glanced back, visibly relieved.  His rear was packed with the luminous spots.  He had no idea what the consequences of being enveloped by them would be, and certainly didn't wish to find out.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren and Zhijian Zhenren were ahead, having already exited the Nine-curve Star River.  Qin Sang saw them exchanging words on the riverbank, before Zhang Zhenren pointed a finger at the void and released a white talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang landed behind them, surveying the area ahead.</p><p>Reaching this side of the Nine-curve Star River meant entering the distorted space within. To their immediate right was an inverted sword peak.  The peak was exceedingly steep, devoid of any vegetation in its crevices.  The rock was jet black, seemingly absorbing nearby light, and the space appeared distorted, incredibly mysterious.</p><p>Above them was the edge of the floating vines.  The long vines hung down like predatory snakes, ready to drag anyone close into captivity.</p><p>Straight ahead was a gigantic funnel, several thousand meters across, constantly rotating.  White light emanated from the funnel, stretched into strands by its rotational force.  The interior seemed to contain a peculiar space. Through the distorted light, one could discern shadows of what looked like pavilions and towers.</p><p>It rotated silently, surrounded by auspicious clouds.  It didn't exert any outward pull, but anyone who saw it knew it was extremely dangerous.</p><p>All sorts of extraordinary phenomena, invisible to the outside world, were commonplace here.</p><p>Auspicious clouds filled the gaps between these chaotic scenes, forming cloud paths that interconnected, forming a vast network.</p><p>Following the cloud paths was the safest way to travel. Reaching the end of a path didn't mean the journey was over; it simply meant that an ancient ruin blocked the way.  Anyone capable of traversing it could continue forward.</p><p>"This Jade Dust Shadow Charm of mine can capture a trace of an opponent's aura even in a place with chaotic energy. It's a top-tier tracking charm, but it's most effective when used immediately after the target has passed by…"</p><p>Zhang Zhenren quickly explained, flicked his finger, and the charm shot out, shattering mid-air with a bang.</p><p>The others, having also prepared tracking techniques, stopped, knowing their methods were inferior to the Jade Dust Shadow Charm.</p><p>After the charm exploded, it transformed into snowflakes that fell like a blizzard, blanketing the Star River Bank.</p><p>The next moment, a snow-white crane emerged from the snow, incredibly majestic. It shook its head slightly, then spread its wings powerfully and flew towards one of the cloud paths.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren, who had been keeping his eyes closed, suddenly opened them, pointing in the direction the crane flew. "The demons went that way!"</p><p>Everyone used their escape techniques to swiftly follow.</p><p>The cloud paths were intricate, and the group followed the crane, weaving through magnificent and bizarre sights.</p><p>Qin Sang was awestruck by the unique scenes.</p><p>Two scenes impressed him the most: remnants of ancient divine powers.</p><p>One was a colossal stone fist, seemingly carved from rock, floating in the void.  One could still sense the terrifying power contained within it, the destructive potential immeasurable.</p><p>The other was a small, green light ring. Even from a distance, Qin Sang felt a sickening dread, as if the ring held the essence of something terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>One could only imagine the strength of the ancient masters.</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren was right; a journey here reveals one's insignificance and inspires self-improvement.</p><p>As they followed the crane, initially on high alert, they couldn't even find a trace of the demon marquis.</p><p>Then, the crane suddenly stopped, circling in place, refusing to move forward. There were clearly no demons nearby, and the charm's power hadn't yet depleted.</p><p>"Hmm? They might have gone in…"</p><p>Zhang Zhenren landed beside the crane, sensed something, and turned towards the left of the cloud path.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren also summoned a jade sword, sensed for a moment, and nodded in agreement with Zhang Zhenren's assessment.</p><p>'Whoosh… whoosh… whoosh…'</p><p>To their left was a curtain of rain.</p><p>The downpour was heavy, the interior dark and nearly impossible to see through.</p><p>Strangely, the raindrops weren't water; they were muddy, yellowish brown, splashing mud when they hit the ground, utterly filthy.</p><p>While there wasn't any immediately apparent danger behind the rain curtain, no one dared to be careless.</p><p>"While the charm's power remains, let's go through here! Everyone, be careful."</p><p>Zhang Zhenren warned, stepping into the rain curtain first. The others exchanged glances and followed suit.</p><p>Their large numbers lessened their hesitation; otherwise, they would have had to decide whether to continue the pursuit or wait there in ambush.</p><p>'Plop! Plop! Plop!'</p><p>Raindrops pelted their bodies.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his qi and blood, activating his protective qi, preventing the rain from getting close.</p><p>After cautiously proceeding for a while, seeing nothing unusual, they were surprised.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's ears twitched. He heard an unusual water sound, and the others heard it too, all turning to look.</p><p>A raindrop landed, failing to merge with the mud. It twisted, growing limbs and a head, rapidly expanding into a ten-foot-tall mud figure, like a clay puppet. Its featureless face was turned towards them, sending a chill down their spines.</p><p>"Summoning soldiers from beans!"</p><p>Guyun Zhenren exclaimed.</p><p>The sight resembled a legendary, powerful Taoist technique.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on the mud figure's power.  Despite being made of mud and seemingly inanimate, it emitted a living aura, comparable to a Yuan Ying cultivator!</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Mud flew as the mud figure transformed into a gray shadow, lunging towards Youhuang Zhenren, who was closest.</p><p>The mud figure raised its arms in an embracing posture, as if trying to hold her tight.</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren lightly hummed, and with a flick of her finger, shot a seed into the mud figure's chest.</p><p>The seed immediately sprouted, its roots and stems quickly covering the mud figure, blossoming into a beautiful spirit flower on its head.</p><p>Soon, the magical flower withered, and the clay figure froze in place, its entire body covered in cracks, like parched earth, crumbling and dissolving into mud.  The magical flower, a manifestation of Taoist magic, vanished at the same time.</p><p>This clay figure was only the beginning.  Everyone then heard that sound repeatedly, as a dozen more clay figures simultaneously rose around them.</p><p>However, having witnessed Master Youhuang destroy the clay figures, everyone felt somewhat reassured.  It seemed the figures possessed no unusual abilities.</p><p>Without needing anyone to tell them, everyone immediately quickened their pace, summoning their magical treasures and abilities, and charged outwards.</p><p>A torrential downpour fell, and the clay figures seemed endless.  Faced with the onslaught, most people unleashed powerful techniques to quickly eliminate them.</p><p>The scene around Qin Sang was particularly peculiar.  Whenever a clay figure approached, it would be pulled by a strange force, and after a brief struggle, it would begin circling Qin Sang.  Although incredibly close, they couldn’t harm him in the least.</p><p>Gradually, more and more clay figures gathered around Qin Sang. With a slight tremor of his arm, a deafening explosion echoed, and all the clay figures burst, their fragments scattering.</p><p>Looking at the empty surroundings, Qin Sang nodded with satisfaction.  His days spent studying the two Buddhist seals had finally borne fruit. He could now merge the Destroyer Seal and the Rotating Platform Seal, combining strength and softness, the results were impressive indeed.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to continue, he felt a sudden shift in his perception, sensing someone's gaze upon him.  Looking up, he saw Venerable Zhenru.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru wielded a staff; with a flash of the staff, another clay figure burst.</p><p>Their eyes met, but Venerable Zhenru didn't flinch, giving Qin Sang a friendly smile.  With a flick of his wrist, there were two sharp cracks as two clay figures near him were flung away.  Then, Venerable Zhenru rested his staff on the ground, put his arm around it, clasped his hands together before his chest, and bowed to Qin Sang.</p><p>Since their encounter, Qin Sang hadn't spoken with Venerable Zhenru, but he’d noticed the Venerable looking towards him repeatedly. It was likely due to the Seven Masters Buddhist Seals.</p><p>The seals contained Buddhist principles; Qin Sang's constant practice would undoubtedly not escape Venerable Zhenru's keen eyes. In this world where Taoism held dominance, Buddhist traditions were few and far between, so it wasn’t surprising that Venerable Zhenru noticed him.</p><p>“Master’s abilities are truly remarkable!” Venerable Zhenru praised.</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare claim such praise, Venerable,” Qin Sang bowed in return.  He agreed to Venerable Zhenru’s invitation to visit Jingtai Temple.</p><p>…</p><p>More clay figures attacked; after a brief exchange, the two continued fighting.</p><p>The further they went, the stronger the clay figures became, though thankfully they didn't encounter any at the Divine Transformation realm.</p><p>Working together, everyone finally broke through the encirclement, passed through the rain-soaked area, and arrived at the other side. Bai Hong's sense became clearer again, guiding them forward.</p><p>After traveling a short distance further, Master Youhuang seemed to see something. He stopped abruptly, calling to everyone and pointing to the right, “I remember that sea of light. Last time we reached this point, we sensed danger and retreated.”</p><p>Everyone gazed in the direction he indicated.  In the right-hand front, amidst layers of fantastical scenery, were several patches of blue light, far apart, indicating the blue sea of light was extremely vast, although most of it was obscured.</p><p>Although the light sea was to their right, not directly ahead, it was becoming increasingly dangerous; danger levels would likely be similar along this path.  If they continued to pursue, they'd soon face the threat of the altar itself, yet they still hadn't seen the Demon Marquis, causing doubts among the group.</p><p>They were here to hunt demons, not for some invaluable opportunity; no one wanted a life-or-death struggle.</p><p>Seeing the group's hesitation, Master Zhang pondered, “I noticed a stone platform on the way here, without any strange energy fluctuations, perfectly calm.  Why don't we set up a large formation there? If anything happens, we can retreat back here, using the protective formation to repel the enemy. What do you think?”</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances, agreeing it was a viable plan. They immediately returned and quickly found the stone platform.  It was very flat.  After a brief inspection, confirming there were no dangers, they decided on a formation and began to set it up together.</p><p>Master Sword drew a formation disk embedded with talismanic swords. Master Zhang assisted him in setting up the disk on the stone platform.  Qin Sang and three others remained on the cloud path, drawing a sword talisman in the air as instructed by Master Sword.</p><p>Once the talismanic image formed, it flew towards the stone platform, merging into the disk. The talismanic swords on the disk glowed brighter, accompanied by the faint sound of swords whistling.</p><p>Working together, the formation was more than halfway complete.  At that moment, Master Zhang suddenly turned towards the depths, listened for a moment, and his face changed drastically.  He shouted, “No good!”</p><p>Everyone hastily looked towards the source of the shout. A blinding golden light suddenly erupted from the depths, its brilliance piercing and excruciating. The golden light formed a ring that instantly engulfed several illusory landscapes, sweeping across all directions.</p><p>Space itself trembled!</p>
