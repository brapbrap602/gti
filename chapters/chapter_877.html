<h1>Chapter 869: Beast King Banners</h1><p>A few Beast King Banners alone, without a formation, likely hold limited power.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't truly coveting the treasure. Stealing these banners would create a greater weakness in their formation, potentially causing them to fail against those mysterious individuals.</p><p>A mutually destructive outcome would be ideal.</p><p>He was happy to cause any trouble for the Black Serpent Mountain sect.</p><p>Qin Sang had already sensed the events unfolding on the island. Chu Heng and the others had perished, leaving him alone. Joining the mysterious group was impossible. The Black Serpent Mountain sect had superior numbers, making revenge difficult. Before leaving, he'd collect some interest.</p><p>Nine Nether Demon Fire engulfed the Beast King Banners.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't certain if the Nine Nether Demon Fire could sever the connection between the banners, but it was worth a try.</p><p>The black-robed figure controlled ten banners in total. One was destroyed by the Blood Defilement Divine Light, leaving nine that violently trembled, attempting to break free from Qin Sang's grasp.</p><p>Enveloped by the Nine Nether Demon Fire, the banners' struggles weakened abruptly.</p><p>Without their master's control, and with the other banners far away, the Nine Nether Demon Fire severed their connection. They became docile, allowing Qin Sang to easily seize all nine.</p><p>Furious shouts echoed from the distant black-robed figure.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, sneered, then his dragon shadow and sword light flashed. Transforming into a streak of light, he vanished into the storm.</p><p>The torrential rain continued through the night, dark clouds obscuring the sky. Visibility was near zero.</p><p>The other Black Serpent Mountain disciples were closing in on their target, unaware of their Fourth Senior Brother's demise. They hadn't seen what transpired.</p><p>By the time they realized something was amiss, it was too late.</p><p>None possessed a movement technique that could match Qin Sang's speed. They could only watch him escape.</p><p>"Fourth Brother!"</p><p>The Second Senior Brother's eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>The others were indecisive, caught in a dilemma. Should they continue pursuing their target or chase the killer? Given the speed of that escaping light, pursuit seemed futile.</p><p>They looked to their Second Senior Brother. Another worry plagued them.</p><p>Their First Senior Brother was still on the island, affected by the lightning, and his whereabouts were unknown. He hadn't even intervened when their Fourth Senior Brother was killed. Had something happened to him as well?</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>A massive figure was flung from the island, crashing into the sea, sending waves surging.</p><p>Then, the Fang youth emerged, blood sword in hand, diving into the ocean.</p><p>The Kui Dragon roared, battling the youth.</p><p>Unlike Chu Heng and the others, the Fang youth had talismans protecting him, minimizing his injuries. However, the astral blight had slowed him down. The Kui Dragon was already gravely wounded, and the clash quickly revealed the victor.</p><p>The Kui Dragon's ambush backfired, resulting in a brutal beating. Its roars turned into pained cries.</p><p>"First Senior Brother!"</p><p>The Black Serpent Mountain disciples rejoiced, their shouts filling the air.</p><p>"First Senior Brother, Fourth Senior Brother is dead!"</p><p>"Avenge Fourth Senior Brother!"</p><p>"Kill that man, tear him limb from limb!"</p><p>...</p><p>A massive hand formed of true essence constricted the Kui Dragon's throat. The Fang youth hovered above the dragon's corpse, a warrior holding a dragon aloft, an image of immense power.</p><p>His face was cold, his gaze fixed on Qin Sang's escape route. He knew of his Fourth Junior Brother's gruesome end.</p><p>But that strange force had delayed him. He hadn't arrived in time. And there was something he was reluctant to admit â€“ the opponent's movement technique was superior to his own. Pursuit was impossible.</p><p>"Capture the Abandoned Gate Disciple first. That man's blood debt will be settled later!"</p><p>The Fang youth prioritized the larger objective.</p><p>He suppressed the Kui Dragon, finally slaying the great demon.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang had escaped, but he hadn't gone far. After confirming no pursuers, he concealed his light and circled in the air. He landed on a distant reef.</p><p>He looked towards the island, his eyes flickering in thought. After a moment of contemplation, he set up concealment barriers and sat down, summoning the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The situation had been too urgent to check on the butterfly earlier, and he was now concerned.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly, having suffered, flew around Qin Sang incessantly before clinging to his wrist, its large wings trembling, seemingly expressing grievance and seeking comfort.</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked and soothed the butterfly, examining its body.</p><p>"Fortunately, it didn't absorb too much, otherwise it would be troublesome. The astral blight described in the 'Demonic Refinement Scripture' is terrifying, and invasion of the spirit is a major problem. The spirit of a spirit insect is too fragile, not as resilient as a demon beast of the same level. The Sky Eye Butterfly's level is also low..."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression eased, a thoughtful look on his face. "Was that power truly astral blight?"</p><p>He was very familiar with astral blight. This power was sinister and chaotic, but how could it coexist with lightning? Was the opponent using a lightning manipulation technique, or a formation?</p><p>What role did the astral blight play?</p><p>The 'Demonic Refinement Scripture' used astral blight to refine demonic bloodlines. Qin Sang, not of demonic descent, could only refine and expel it, a complete waste.</p><p>If he could obtain that lightning technique, he might be able to make use of it.</p><p>First, he needed to ascertain the identity of those mysterious individuals and why the Black Serpent Mountain disciples were ambushing them.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't left immediately because his superior movement technique allowed him to come and go freely. He intended to stay and see if there were any opportunities to exploit the situation.</p><p>Stroking the Sky Eye Butterfly, he thought of the Ebony Sword and the Star Conch. Both of these decisive techniques were spent and wouldn't recover soon. He would need to be cautious in his future actions.</p><p>Then, he opened his palm, revealing the newly acquired Beast King Banners.</p><p>Bound by the Nine Nether Demon Fire, the banners were subdued.</p><p>Worried that a connection between the banners remained, allowing the enemy to track him, Qin Sang immediately probed them with his divine sense.</p><p>Moments later, a pleased expression appeared on his face. He'd found something.</p><p>"There are indeed residual marks! Break!"</p><p>The marks within the Beast King Banners were forcibly erased. A golden light flashed on the banners, severing their connection with the others, granting Qin Sang full control.</p><p>"Each Beast King Banner holds the spirit of a demon beast..."</p><p>While erasing the marks, Qin Sang also learned the nature of the banners, surprised by his discovery. The banners themselves were of average quality, their materials unremarkable. But their crafting was exquisite, and their power stemmed from the beast spirits within.</p><p>"The Beast King Banners demand a powerful divine sense. A late Core Formation cultivator can only control around twenty. Too few, while allowing forced formation deployment, results in weak, useless power. A Nascent Soul ancestor could control this set, but their power would be too limited... Such effort in crafting, only for use in conjunction with others. For sect disciples, with close cooperation between fellow disciples, it's indeed a decent combined attack treasure. But alone, without a sect or disciples, it's rather impractical..."</p><p>Qin Sang said, somewhat disappointed.</p>
