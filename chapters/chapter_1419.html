<h1>Chapter 1411: The Tide-Summoning Horseshoe Crab's Power</h1><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly could assist in analyzing the formation, so Qin Sang walked in front, able to react promptly to the changes in the Thousand Buddha Wall and the Fiery Flames.</p><p>He volunteered.</p><p>Master Mu and the others were happy to oblige.</p><p>Before the Thousand Buddha Wall.</p><p>Qin Sang was the first to enter the fissure, his figure almost merging with the Buddha light and the Fiery Flames.</p><p>Following close behind Qin Sang was Master Mu, a step slower, following Qin Sang's guidance, wielding his snake spear to clear the way.</p><p>Qi and Wang brought up the rear, resisting the strange winds.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>The long-plotting Hunmo Elder and the Restrained True Person finally made their move.</p><p>The atmosphere solidified at this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang was the first to become alert, his thunderous roar causing Master Mu and the other two to tense, their faces changing.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Master Mu also sensed something amiss.</p><p>But he was still a step slower than the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>While Qi and Wang were both completely bewildered.</p><p>Because they had long suspected Jiu Jie, since entering the formation, they had never let their guard down, using various methods to investigate, preventing anyone with malicious intent.</p><p>This spirit formation was very peculiar, likely a secret technique of the Buddhist sect; not only them, but probably even throughout the North Sea, the number of cultivators who had heard of it could be counted on the fingers of one hand.</p><p>Within such a spirit formation, the possibility of someone tracking them was extremely low.</p><p>Therefore, after confirming there were no abnormalities, they focused most of their energy on breaking the spirit formation.</p><p>Unexpectedly.</p><p>Someone could actually use the power of the spirit formation to evade their perception!</p><p>At the same time, a soft gasp was heard.</p><p>In the void.</p><p>With the help of the Jiu Jie ring, Hunmo Elder and Restrained True Person, using the power of the formation, quietly approached.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's shout, Hunmo Elder's cloudy eyes slightly shifted, falling on Qin Sang, a flash of brilliance appearing deep within his gaze.</p><p>Restrained True Person was even more nervous.</p><p>They had been exposed sooner than expected!</p><p>They had taken precautions, but it seems they had underestimated the opponent's investigative abilities.</p><p>According to the original plan, they would quietly approach while Qin Sang and the others were crossing the fissure, their attention focused on dealing with the Buddha light and Fiery Flame impact, then suddenly attack, easily eliminating their opponents.</p><p>Who would have thought that even grand cultivators would resort to sneak attacks, so lacking in decorum?</p><p>The plan changed.</p><p>Hunmo Elder's expression remained unchanged, without the slightest sign of panic, he forcefully tapped his black bamboo staff.</p><p>There was no need to hide anymore.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The strange wind surged.</p><p>A black light shot out like an arrow, the powerful aura of a grand cultivator undeniable.</p><p>“Late Yuan Ying Stage! Hunmo Elder!”</p><p>Qin Sang's mind quickly flashed with this name.</p><p>The most famous grand cultivator of the Boundless Sea, Hunmo Elder!</p><p>Qin Sang had only recently heard of the renowned Hunmo Elder at the Nine Stars Gathering, never expecting to encounter him so soon.</p><p>Hunmo Island and the Empty Spirit Sea were far apart.</p><p>The Empty Spirit Sea's strange phenomenon alarming Hunmo Elder was not surprising to Qin Sang; the reason they were so eager to break through the formation was precisely because they were worried about grand cultivators like Hunmo Elder appearing to disrupt their plans.</p><p>To think he came so quickly!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A muffled sound.</p><p>Qi and Wang were shocked to discover that the tassel-like protective barrier formed by the Thousand Lines Armor was easily pierced by the strange black bamboo staff.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's shout still echoed in their minds.</p><p>They were using the Thousand Lines Armor to resist the strange wind, never expecting to be ambushed here.</p><p>Hunmo Elder's movements were too fast; even with Qin Sang's warning, they were unable to redirect the Thousand Lines Armor's main body to block the black bamboo staff.</p><p>The protective barrier formed by the tassel-like illusory light of the treasure now appeared exceptionally thin, instantly torn apart.</p><p>However, Qi and Wang were Yuan Ying cultivators after all.</p><p>Fear did not affect their judgment.</p><p>The Qi cultivator hurriedly summoned his spirit sword.</p><p>But the following scene made his eyes widen in disbelief, his eyes instantly bloodshot.</p><p>“Dodge!”</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>A roar and a muffled sound rang out simultaneously.</p><p>As the black bamboo staff broke through the Thousand Lines Armor, a burst of golden light suddenly erupted.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was a string of prayer beads, hidden behind the black bamboo staff, seizing the opportunity to attack.</p><p>There were nine beads, their surfaces rough and uneven, appearing to be made from the kernels of some spirit fruit, looking quite unsightly, yet they were a Buddhist treasure.</p><p>The power they emitted was extremely strong and fierce!</p><p>The target was the female cultivator surnamed Wang's back!</p><p>The prayer beads belonged to Restrained True Person.</p><p>His coordination with Hunmo Elder was extremely precise, choosing the cultivator with the lowest cultivation, the female cultivator surnamed Wang, as their breakthrough point.</p><p>The female cultivator surnamed Wang had no time to react, struck by the prayer beads in the back, her bones shattered, spitting blood, her breath instantly weakening, the light in her eyes visibly fading.</p><p>Just at that moment…</p><p>A female cultivator, surnamed Wang, saw a flash of light from her head. Her Nascent Soul popped out, looking around in confusion.  She didn't even understand what kind of opponent she'd faced, watching helplessly as her damaged physical body was smashed towards the Qi cultivator by a string of prayer beads.</p><p>Master Zhijie completely ignored her Nascent Soul and went straight for the Qi cultivator. Her situation was even more perilous than her companion's.</p><p>Clearly, the Hunmo Elder had anticipated this.  After his black bamboo staff shattered the Thousand-Layer Armor, it struck directly at her head.  The staff's tip held a dense, persistent black aura, mere inches from Wang's Nascent Soul!</p><p>It seemed Wang's Nascent Soul was about to be obliterated by the black bamboo staff; she didn't even have time to teleport.</p><p>However, the Hunmo Elder's true target wasn't Wang. A mere early-stage Nascent Soul wasn't worth his attention.  His elaborate scheme targeted Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The black bamboo staff sliced through the air, seemingly a casual sweep. The Hunmo Elder didn't even glance at Qi and Wang, rushing straight towards Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu!</p><p>At that moment,</p><p>Qin Sang had just entered the fissure, with the crimson light pressing in from both sides.  Caught between the Buddhist light and the fiery energy, Qin Sang was in a desperate situation.  The Hunmo Elder's timing was impeccable.</p><p>Fortunately,</p><p>Valley Master Mu was a step behind.  Furthermore, Qin Sang had foreseen the Hunmo Elder's attack, buying them precious time.</p><p>Valley Master Mu, a seasoned warrior, alerted by Qin Sang, realized the enemy could only attack from behind. He knew the greatest danger wasn't to him or Qin Sang, but to Qi and Wang.</p><p>Yet, even with his accurate judgment, he couldn't prevent Wang's physical body from being destroyed.  Seeing his companion's desperate situation, Valley Master Mu's face filled with fury.  A blue light flashed from his dantian, and the Tide-Summoning Crab emerged.</p><p>Wherever the Tide-Summoning Crab passed, it seemed a pool of water appeared in the void.  Its body hovered before Valley Master Mu, its tail lashing out, unleashing a surge of intense blue light towards Wang's Nascent Soul.</p><p>The next moment,</p><p>A blue light barrier, like a bubble, spontaneously appeared around Wang's Nascent Soul, enveloping her.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>In an instant, the black bamboo staff swept across. The Tide-Summoning Crab let out a mournful cry as the bubble shattered, fragments scattering everywhere, but it bought Wang a chance to escape.</p><p>Wang, terrified, instinctively teleported dozens of meters away, finally avoiding the staff's destructive force and escaping death.</p>
