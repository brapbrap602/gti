<h1>Chapter 952: Green Bamboo</h1><p>Chapter 952: Green Bamboo</p><p>Silence reigned behind the door.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned a corpse puppet, leading the way up the stone steps.</p><p>He and his avatar followed behind.</p><p>The corpse puppet's footsteps echoed on the long stone stairs, quickly reaching the end and entering through the door.</p><p>Behind the door was another obviously dilapidated hall.</p><p>Strangely, the hall only had this one door, no other exits. Inside the hall, there was a damaged formation.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared at the doorway, examining the hall and the damaged formation.</p><p>"It seems to be some kind of spirit-gathering array."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself. He noticed some clues; the formation, when complete, was a spirit-gathering array, and it was more exquisite than any he had ever seen.</p><p>After carefully checking again, confirming there was nothing else, and finding no trace left by Elder Green Bamboo, Qin Sang went to the other side of the hall and examined the walls.</p><p>There must be another exit in the hall.</p><p>He summoned his ebony sword, activating sword energy, and made a feint strike at the stone wall.</p><p>The sword energy disappeared into the stone wall.</p><p>"As I thought."</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy, he repeatedly used the sword energy to strike; all were absorbed by the stone wall.  Soon a door appeared on the wall, similar to the one in the Ziwei Palace ancient temple.</p><p>The corpse puppet went out first.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang followed.</p><p>"This place?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the surrounding scenery, a strong look of surprise on his face.</p><p>The exit of the ancient temple was also on a stone wall, but outside was a desolate scene.</p><p>The corpse puppet was standing on top of the stone wall.</p><p>Qin Sang flickered and floated up, surveying his surroundings, his surprise deepening.</p><p>Let's call it the eighth level of the Sky Tower.</p><p>It was a vast expanse, its size probably not inferior to the seventh level. However, this level didn't have towering peaks, but an open space, some undulating mountains, but none particularly high.</p><p>Surprisingly, this was the most complete space Qin Sang had seen since entering the Sky Tower.</p><p>The lower seven levels were all fragmented, even the mountains of the seventh level were shattered.  The eighth level, however, was perfectly intact; the earth and mountains were undamaged, the war hadn't reached here.</p><p>However, compared to the seventh level, this place was incredibly oppressive.</p><p>The space was unusually dark, with thick black clouds hovering overhead. It was unknown what substance they were formed from; the lower parts even touched the mountaintops, feeling like a weight on his heart.</p><p>The earth and mountains were completely exposed; not a single trace of green was visible, not even withered plants; everywhere was the same black as the clouds.</p><p>Dead silence, desolation.</p><p>The eighth level of the Sky Tower was a place utterly devoid of life.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave.  For some reason, a wave of sadness washed over him.</p><p>"Could anything still remain in a place like this?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, his eyes searching, "Could the ancient transmission array be here?"</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there was only desolate black; distant mountain shadows undulated, with no man-made structures visible. Qin Sang knew he had to search himself; Elder Green Bamboo hadn't left a single clue.</p><p>The good news was that the entire space was very quiet, with no beasts inhabiting it.</p><p>He summoned his ebony sword, chose a direction, and along with his avatar, searched for any places where there might be a restriction. This space was quite large, so they needed to act quickly. Qin Sang chose a direction with a tall mountain peak.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang arrived at the foot of the mountain, concealed his figure, and darted toward the summit.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Reaching the summit, Qin Sang looked around and finally found something unusual in one direction.</p><p>Only at the end of that direction was a neat black line, like a sheer cliff, where the earth simply ended, very peculiar.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang flew down the mountain, deciding to take a look at the cliff first.</p><p>Passing over the black mountains, as he neared the cliff, Qin Sang suddenly stopped, his face filled with shock.</p><p>He heard Bai Ji's urgent warning, "Careful! Someone!"</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked to discover that on a mountain next to the cliff, a person was standing!</p><p>This person was tall and slender, straight as a pine tree, with hands clasped behind their back, facing away from them, gazing into the cliff, standing motionless, exuding no aura whatsoever.</p><p>Before this, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, ever vigilant, had not detected the person's presence.</p><p>This person seemed to have appeared out of thin air, like a ghost.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded.</p><p>The person slowly turned, their gaze like knives, instantly fixed on Qin Sang. Qin Sang's concealment technique was useless against this person's sight.</p><p>"Elder Green Bamboo!"</p><p>Seeing the person's face, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically, he exclaimed involuntarily.</p><p>He had seen Elder Green Bamboo's portrait in Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Legends of Green Bamboo had been passed down in Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Losing his temper for a beauty, cleaving Mount Jianmen, single-handedly killing his way up to the Yuan Shen Gate, slaying a Golden Core cultivator…</p><p>Every feat was thrilling and inspiring.</p><p>Although Shaohua Mountain, to save face for Yuanshen Sect, deliberately ignored this person's existence, the disciples' admiration couldn't be contained, and Elder Qingzhu's portrait continued to circulate among them.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang unexpectedly met the real person.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu's whereabouts had always been shrouded in mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang initially suspected he had found an ancient teleportation array and returned to Xiaohan Domain. After finding Linggui Island, she learned that Elder Qingzhu had been attacked by his enemies, engaged in a great battle, and his whereabouts became unknown.</p><p>She thought the chances of seeing Elder Qingzhu again were slim, yet she encountered him unexpectedly.</p><p>Strangely, why did Elder Qingzhu appear here?</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Elder Qingzhu must be a Yuan Ying stage expert; otherwise, he couldn't have easily deceived the Sky-Eye Butterfly's perception.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't know Elder Qingzhu's true nature, or whether he was truly as righteous as the legends described.  She felt a surge of apprehension, her body tensing up.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Qin Sang opened her mouth, about to speak, when she suddenly felt something was wrong.</p><p>Qingzhu stood in the darkness.  Upon seeing Qin Sang, the corner of his mouth curled up into a sinister smile, making Qin Sang's heart jump.</p><p>“The Seed of the Demon Embryo, another fool who doesn't know when to die…”</p><p>Qingzhu sneered, his voice echoing in Qin Sang's ear, carrying a strange coldness that chilled her to the bone, making her shiver.  “Unexpectedly, there's a bonus. It seems you are his chosen successor?”</p><p>“No! You're not…”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>This person had Elder Qingzhu's face, yet he referred to Qingzhu as 'him'.</p><p>His tone suggested an unusual familiarity with both Qingzhu and the "Seed of the Demon Embryo."</p><p>“Could it be…”</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at her external avatar beside her, her figure trembled, three-colored遁光 flashed, and her main body retreated hastily, choosing to flee without hesitation.</p><p>Simultaneously, the external avatar did the opposite, charging towards Qingzhu with a blood-red sword.</p><p>Seeing this, a look of disdain flashed in Qingzhu's eyes, his evil smile deepening, as if he were watching a plaything struggling to its death.</p>
