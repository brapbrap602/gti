<h1>Chapter 288: Luring</h1><p>Yu Kong sneered. Then without further ado, he shot a beam of red light from his palm that headed straight towards Old Mu Teng. This was the same chain that had been used to rescue Yan Wu, and was a first rate magical tool.</p><p>Everyone still didn’t really understand what was happening, and no one dared to throw their hat in the ring and help either side. They watched as Yu Kong attacked Old Mu Teng.</p><p>The chain became a fiery beam and shot out.</p><p>But when the chain reached the middle of the air, something strange happened.</p><p>Just as it passed in front of Crescent Moon, it turned sharply and its speed increased dramatically, wrapping around her like a spirit snake.</p><p>Crescent Moon was caught off guard. By the time she realized that something was wrong with the chain, it was too late. Before her red silk threads had completely deployed, the chain effortlessly knocked them out of the way and bound her up tightly.</p><p>At the same time, as soon as Yu Kong made his move, Old Mu Teng gave up on any hope of fortune. He gave a loud shout, stamped on the ground, and dozens of thick vines grew out from the cracks in the stone before growing madly, wrapping around each other. In the blink of an eye, they formed a huge and solid wall in front of Old Mu Teng.</p><p>Old Mu Teng used the momentum to retreat into the cave, hoping that the wall of vines would hold Yu Kong back for a while so that he could escape through the exit.</p><p>But just as he moved, a thin black sword suddenly stabbed towards him. The sword had appeared without warning, soundlessly, and from an extremely treacherous angle, aiming directly for Old Mu Teng’s chest.</p><p>If he ignored it and continued to run, there was no doubt that the long sword would pierce his chest.</p><p>Old Mu Teng was taken aback. He came to an abrupt stop and twisted his body into a strange shape, seeing that the person holding the sword was Yan Wu!</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>Old Mu Teng roared, suddenly understanding something.</p><p>After entering the Rainbow Bridge, Yan Wu had stood to one side, silent. He had even stood at the back of the group, ignored by everyone as they were drawn to the mysterious herb garden.</p><p>But when Yan Wu had suddenly attacked, everyone realised that it had been a ruse. Yan Wu was Yu Kong’s man, and had been hiding behind everyone, planning to cut off Old Mu Teng’s escape!</p><p>Apart from Old Mu Teng, Qin Sang was also horrified.</p><p>If he had known that Yan Wu was with Yu Kong, he would not have used him to set an example, even if it meant putting up with Yan Wu’s mockery!</p><p>But it was too late for regrets now.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered as he thought quickly, but he still didn’t crush the soul-linked talisman or help Old Mu Teng.</p><p>“You old goat...”</p><p>A cruel smile appeared at the corner of Yan Wu’s mouth. “Get back here!”</p><p>A yellow talisman flew out of Yan Wu’s hand. It shattered in the air, transforming into a lightning bolt as thin as a hair. The lightning was silent, and went straight for Old Mu Teng’s face.</p><p>The lightning bolt looked incredibly weak, but the faces of everyone else, not just Old Mu Teng, were filled with fear.</p><p>This talisman must have been created with an extremely advanced incantation. The lightning contained a terrifying power!</p><p>Old Mu Teng, who was directly facing the lightning, felt it most intuitively. He had evaded the hidden sword with great force, and now he was being forced back by Yan Wu. If he didn’t want to be killed, he had no choice but to retreat.</p><p>There was no other way.</p><p>Of course Old Mu Teng didn’t want to die at Yan Wu’s hands, but he didn’t dare to retreat either. He kept up his strange posture, his upper body suddenly bending as if it had been folded in half, narrowly dodging the lightning. He then transformed into a green light and bolted towards the exit.</p><p>But Old Mu Teng was a step too late. Yu Kong had already dealt with Crescent Moon, and the chain wrapped around him faster than he could move.</p><p>Yan Wu was not to be outdone. His thin sword suddenly appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>He attacked from both sides. What’s more, Yu Kong was at a much higher cultivation level, so Old Mu Teng could hardly put up any resistance before the chain pierced his brain and killed him.</p><p>Yu Kong flicked his arm and retracted the chain. Old Mu Teng’s body fell with a thud next to Crescent Moon.</p><p>“Senior Yu, I’d never met that old goat before. Why did you attack me? Are you trying to kill us all?” Crescent Moon was terrified and cried out in fear.</p><p>As she spoke, Crescent Moon looked at Qin Sang and the others. The meaning in her eyes was clear: hurry up and attack, don’t let Yu Kong pick us off one by one.</p><p>――――――</p><p>“You’re quite a flirt. I can’t believe that old fool Luo Xing Nan was willing to let his mistress be used as bait. But I’m not interested in you. Today is your death day!”</p><p>Yu Kong’s gaze swept across the faces of the two prisoners. His tone was so cold that it sent shivers down their spines.</p><p>The Crescent Fairy was shocked speechless. After a moment of stiffness, she gave up struggling, "So you knew it all along?"</p><p>Yu Kong sneered and said nothing, turning his head to look at Qin Sang, Shangguan Lifeng, and Wu Chen. "Fellow Daoists, don't be afraid. You saw what happened outside the cave. This Yu has an old grudge with those two old fellows. These two are spies they sent to spy on this Yu. This Yu deliberately let them in, also intending to take the opportunity to settle old grudges, and it has nothing to do with you three. When the time comes to search for the treasure, this Yu will still keep his promise."</p><p>Yan Wu held the sword upside down, walked behind Yu Kong, and with his tall stature, he looked like a competent bodyguard.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng embraced the long knife, and his expression was unexceptional.</p><p>The look of astonishment on Wu Chen's face had not yet dissipated. Hearing Yu Kong's words, his anxiety eased slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head slightly and sensed keenly that Yan Wu's gaze was filled with a playful and mocking intent, occasionally falling on him.</p><p>After reassuring the three of Qin Sang, Yu Kong bent down.</p><p>"You have already passed on the message, haven't you?"</p><p>A strange smile appeared on the corner of Yu Kong's mouth. Ignoring the complex expression of astonishment and fear on the Crescent Fairy's face, spiritual power surged out of his palm, and with a palm, he killed the Crescent Fairy, sealed the bloody smell of the corpse, and then drew on it.</p><p>In the end, the spiritual power formed a strange pattern. After a flash, the pattern disappeared. Yan Wu took out a few more符纸  and stuck them on their bodies.</p><p>Qin Sang silently watched their movements, and he could hear the clue from Yu Kong's words.</p><p>Yu Kong deliberately let the two spies in, allowing them to see the process of opening the secret passage and letting them spread it out, obviously intending to lure Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi.</p><p>Where did his confidence come from, that he could handle two people whose strength was not inferior to his at the same time?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the outside of the cave, and the mystery should be just ahead.</p><p>"Follow me."</p><p>After these actions, Yu Kong carefully erased the traces of the battle in the cave. In fact, neither the Old Man Mu Teng nor the Crescent Fairy could make a decent resistance. Besides a few withered vines, there were no traces left.</p><p>Then, Yu Kong turned his spiritual power into a large hand, carrying the two corpses towards the outside of the cave.</p><p>Yan Wu raised his sword, looking around, and the three of them looked at each other and quickly followed.</p><p>Chapter 288: The Lure</p><p>Yu Kong let out a cold laugh, and without another word, a streak of red light shot out from his palm towards Elder Muteng. It was the same chain that had rescued Yan Wu, a top-grade magical tool.</p><p>The others, still unclear about the situation, didn't dare to interfere. They watched as Yu Kong attacked Elder Muteng.</p><p>The chain zipped through the air like a fiery line.</p><p>As the chain reached the middle of the air, another unexpected event occurred.</p><p>Just as it passed by Crescent Fairy, it abruptly changed direction and, with a burst of speed, wrapped around her like a viper.</p><p>Caught off guard, Crescent Fairy reacted too late. By the time she hastily activated her red silk threads for defense, the chain had already effortlessly swatted them away, binding her tightly.</p><p>Meanwhile, when Yu Kong made his move, Elder Muteng abandoned any lingering hope of a lucky escape. With a loud roar, he stomped his foot on the ground. Dozens of thick vines erupted from cracks in the stone, growing wildly and intertwining.  In the blink of an eye, a massive, thick wall of vines formed in front of him.</p><p>Elder Muteng himself used the force of the vines' growth to propel himself backward towards the cave entrance, hoping the wall would buy him enough time to escape.</p><p>However, just as he moved, a thin black sword appeared out of nowhere, silently and insidiously aimed directly at his chest.</p><p>Had he continued his retreat, the sword would undoubtedly have pierced his heart.</p><p>A warning flared in Elder Muteng's mind. He abruptly stopped, contorting his body into a grotesque angle to dodge the sword.  He then saw that the person wielding the sword was Yan Wu!</p><p>"You!" Elder Muteng roared, suddenly understanding.</p><p>Ever since they entered through the rainbow bridge, Yan Wu had remained silent, staying at the back of the group.  Everyone's attention had been drawn to the mysterious medicinal garden, and no one had paid attention to Yan Wu's inconspicuous behavior.</p><p>Now, with Yan Wu's sudden attack, everyone realized he was Yu Kong's man all along, positioned at the rear to cut off Elder Muteng's escape route!</p><p>Not only Elder Muteng, but Qin Sang's heart also sank.</p><p>If he had known Yan Wu was Yu Kong's accomplice, even if it meant enduring Yan Wu's mockery, he would never have used him to assert his dominance!</p><p>But now it was too late for regrets.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as thoughts raced through his mind.  However, he still didn't crush the Harmony Amulet, nor did he intervene to help Elder Muteng.</p><p>"You old fool..." A cruel smile played on Yan Wu's lips. "Get back there!"</p><p>*Slap!*</p><p>A yellow talisman floated out of Yan Wu's hand, bursting into a thin, hair-like lightning bolt in mid-air. The lightning was silent and aimed directly at Elder Muteng's face.</p><p>Though the lightning seemed delicate, it instilled a deep sense of dread in everyone present, not just Elder Muteng.</p><p>This talisman was clearly created with a highly advanced spell, containing a frightening destructive power!</p><p>Facing the lightning head-on, Elder Muteng had the clearest sense of its danger. Already off-balance from dodging the hidden sword, and now pressured by Yan Wu, he had no choice but to retreat if he wanted to survive.</p><p>There was no other option.</p><p>Naturally, Elder Muteng didn't want to die at Yan Wu's hands, but he feared the lightning even more.  He maintained his twisted posture, bending his upper body back as if broken in half, narrowly avoiding the lightning bolt.  Then, he transformed into a streak of green light, charging with all his might toward the exit.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was a step too late.  Yu Kong had already subdued Crescent Fairy. The chain, moving even faster than Elder Muteng, wrapped around him.</p><p>Yan Wu, not to be outdone, attacked with his elusive sword.</p><p>Caught between the two, and with Yu Kong's cultivation a full realm higher, Elder Muteng barely put up a fight before the chain pierced the back of his head, killing him instantly.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, Yu Kong retracted the chain. Elder Muteng's body landed with a thud beside Crescent Fairy.</p><p>"Senior Yu, I didn't even know that old fool! Why did you attack me? Do you intend to kill us all?" Crescent Fairy cried out in terror, pleading her innocence.</p><p>As she spoke, she glanced at Qin Sang and the others, urging them to intervene before Yu Kong picked them off one by one.</p><p>――――――</p><p>“You’re quite the flirtatious one. I didn't expect that old scoundrel Luo Xingnan to send his mistress out as a spy.  Too bad I have no interest in you. Today is your last day.” Yu Kong’s gaze swept over the two captives, his tone chillingly indifferent.</p><p>Crescent Fairy gaped, speechless. After a moment, she gave up struggling. "You knew all along?"</p><p>Yu Kong gave a cold laugh and turned to Qin Sang, Shangguan Lifeng, and Wu Chen. "Don't be afraid, fellow Daoists. You saw what happened outside the cave. I have an old grudge with those two. They were spies sent by Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi. I deliberately let them in so I could settle the score. It has nothing to do with you three. When it comes to claiming the treasures, I will keep my promise."</p><p>Yan Wu, sword in hand, walked behind Yu Kong, acting like a dutiful bodyguard.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, arms crossed around his long saber, showed no emotion.</p><p>The surprise hadn't yet left Wu Chen’s face, but hearing Yu Kong's words, his anxiety eased somewhat.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head slightly, keenly aware of Yan Wu's gaze, filled with the amusement of a cat toying with a mouse, occasionally resting on him.</p><p>After reassuring the three, Yu Kong crouched down.</p><p>“You’ve already sent the message out, haven’t you?” A sinister smile appeared on Yu Kong's lips. Ignoring Crescent Fairy’s look of terror and fear, he channeled spiritual energy into his palm, striking her dead with a single blow. He then sealed the scent of blood from her corpse and began drawing on it with his spiritual energy.</p><p>Finally, the spiritual energy formed a strange pattern.  After flickering for a moment, the pattern faded. Yan Wu took out several talismans and stuck them to the corpses.</p><p>Qin Sang watched their actions silently, discerning Yu Kong's intentions.</p><p>Yu Kong had deliberately let the two spies in, allowing them to witness the process of opening the secret passage and spreading the news. His purpose was clearly to lure Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi.</p><p>Where did he get the confidence to deal with two opponents as strong as himself?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced toward the cave entrance. The key must lie ahead.</p><p>"Follow me."</p><p>After these preparations, Yu Kong meticulously erased the traces of the fight in the cave.  In truth, neither Elder Muteng nor Crescent Fairy had put up much of a resistance, so aside from a few withered vines, there wasn't much to clean up.</p><p>Then, Yu Kong transformed his spiritual energy into a large hand, lifting the two bodies and walking out of the cave.</p><p>Yan Wu, sword in hand, followed closely behind, casting vigilant glances around. The remaining three exchanged looks and quickly followed.</p>
