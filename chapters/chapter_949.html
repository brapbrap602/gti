<h1>Chapter 941: The Great Demonic Sealing Formation</h1><p>“Fellow Daoist, can’t you see?  The more banners there are, the more demanding it becomes for the wielder,” Qin Sang said calmly, not getting carried away by the refinement of this powerful treasure. “Limited by my cultivation and spiritual sense, even if I had a true top-grade magical treasure, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to unleash much of its power.  This type of banner formation treasure is even more so. At my current realm, controlling six or seven is about my limit. This level of power is still insufficient to contend with a Nascent Soul Grandmaster! I'm still a long way from fully unleashing the power of all eighteen demonic banners.”</p><p>He had already carefully calculated everything.</p><p>The number of demonic banners wasn’t simply a matter of more being better. One had to act within their capabilities, skillfully manipulating them during combat to unleash their true power.</p><p>Of course, even if he could only control six demonic banners simultaneously, their power would be astonishing, comparable to a high-grade magical treasure. They were supreme treasures that other Core Formation cultivators could only dream of.</p><p>Bai didn't say much, resting briefly before returning to the ghost fog to attract more lost souls.</p><p>The demonic banners took shape one after another.</p><p>Bai gritted his teeth and toiled, finally helping Qin Sang refine fifteen demonic banners.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>With Qin Sang's true essence urging it on, the last demonic banner vibrated, its surface fluttering with a hunting sound.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang gestured with his finger.</p><p>The previous three Ten Yama Banners flew out from his sleeve, followed by the fifteen new demonic banners, which revolved around them, faintly outlining the form of a grand demonic banner formation.</p><p>Even with Qin Sang's composure, he couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement. This would likely be his most powerful magical treasure for a long time to come. After reaching Nascent Soul, he could rely on this treasure to overpower cultivators of the same rank.</p><p>After all, even among Nascent Soul Grandmasters, only a very few were fortunate enough to possess top-grade magical treasures.</p><p>“Congratulations, Fellow Daoist, on refining this powerful treasure.”</p><p>Bai offered his congratulations, the joy in his eyes hard to conceal. The prison and obsession that had plagued him for countless years were finally about to be resolved.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly. “Fellow Daoist, you can now lead me to collect the demonic fire. I hope the weakness in the demonic seal you mentioned can be exploited without any unforeseen issues.”</p><p>“Rest assured,” Bai said confidently. “I've been thinking about breaking free every moment. How could there be any oversight at this point? Follow me…”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Bai released the gathered souls, flickered, and vanished into the ghost fog.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his avatar and phoenix wings, keeping only the Two-Headed Flood Dragon by his side, and then pursued Bai into the depths of the ghost lands.  Before long, he saw Bai stop ahead.</p><p>They were now at the spot where Bai had previously hidden the Flying Night Demon.</p><p>This place had just experienced a fierce battle. The surrounding bone mountains had mostly collapsed, leaving ravines, scattered bones, and wandering souls, creating a scene of utter chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang finally had a chance to examine the area closely.</p><p>His gaze swept back and forth, finding nothing unusual. Finally, his eyes landed on the bone mountain that Bai had broken open. He suspected there must be something hidden beneath.</p><p>Even the Sky-Eye Butterfly couldn't see through the secrets hidden here, likely due to the demonic seal and the soul-purifying formation.</p><p>“Disperse!”</p><p>Bai roared, corpse energy surging from his body, unleashing a strange wave.</p><p>The surrounding souls, as if encountering their nemesis, screamed in fear and scattered, leaving the area around them instantly empty.</p><p>Then, Bai flashed down to the ravaged bone mountain, sending out beams of spiritual light that carved a passage leading straight to its base.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed to the entrance of the passage and extended his spiritual sense inside to confirm there was no danger before stepping in.</p><p>Walking through the passage formed by white bones, Qin Sang felt a tremor in his heart.  Gazing at Bai's back, he fell into deep thought.</p><p>He wondered what Bai and his companions had experienced to meet such a tragic end.</p><p>The vast ghost lands were filled with mountains of bones and countless souls. If they were all once cultivators, it was difficult to imagine the scale of that ancient battle.</p><p>The Seven Kills Sect seal.</p><p>The current fragmented state of the cultivation world, ravaged by storms everywhere.</p><p>Was there a connection to that great battle?</p><p>It was a pity that Bai had lost his memory; otherwise, he could have gleaned some insight into ancient secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly and silently followed Bai until they reached the base of the bone mountain. The black ground appeared strangely ominous, a dried blood-stained color that contrasted sharply with the white bones.</p><p>The ground seemed empty, but with a wave of Bai's hand, a stairway shimmered into existence, leading down to what appeared to be a sizable cavern.</p><p>Following Bai inside, Qin Sang’s eyes flashed with surprise as he saw the scene within.</p><p>The cavern was quite spacious but low, barely allowing Qin Sang to stand upright.</p><p>In the center stood an ancient altar, its stone pillars etched with the marks of time, as if it had lain dormant for countless years, decaying alongside the bones outside.</p><p>Beside the altar was a stone coffin, its lid open and empty.</p><p>The altar and the coffin were the only things in the cavern.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the altar.</p><p>Even with his expertise in formations and restrictions, he couldn’t discern its purpose, only guessing that it might be the core of the soul-purifying formation.</p><p>When Qin Sang’s gaze shifted to the stone coffin, Bai gave a wry smile. “This is where I slumbered. If it weren’t for your unexpected arrival, this would have been my final resting place.  Perhaps my original body left this coffin, anticipating that I would never see the light of day again.”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, enduring endless solitude trapped here is beyond what ordinary people can bear,” Qin Sang said with feeling.</p><p>“Once I forgot the passage of time, I grew accustomed to it,” Bai said with a dry chuckle, then pointed to the altar. “The first thing you need to do is collect the demonic fire within the demonic seals surrounding the altar. This is the most crucial point, and it’s easier to accomplish here. Once this demonic seal is broken, it will be much easier to deal with the others. As long as the demonic seals in these key locations are all broken, we can use the ghost fog and the formation to forcefully break through the remaining seals...”</p><p>“Wait…” Qin Sang interrupted Bai. “The moment the seal is broken, the commotion will be immense. We’re exposed here in the ghost lands and will be affected as well. Where should we hide then, and how can we avoid the detection of the person outside?”</p><p>Bai said confidently, “Don't worry, Fellow Daoist. I will guide the initial burst of energy towards the entrance before breaking the seal. Besides, there are places here unaffected by the aftershocks. We only need to wait for the impact to weaken and leave immediately. I will manipulate the remaining ghost fog to help us conceal ourselves.  That person will be caught off guard by the sudden impact and, even if not seriously injured, will be too preoccupied to notice anything else. That’s our opportunity to escape…”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist's plan is quite thorough! In that case, I also have a treasure that might be helpful. That person is a top expert after all. We need more concealment methods to be safe…”</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang pondered for a moment and then retrieved a piece of red gauze from his Qianjun Ring—the ancient treasure, Red Essence Gauze, obtained from the young man surnamed Fang.</p>
