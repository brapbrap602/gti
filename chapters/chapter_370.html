<h1>Chapter 363: Refinement of Magical Instruments</h1><p>Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared at the Dao Gate Peak.</p><p>The disciples coming and going on Dao Gate Peak were all unfamiliar faces.  Qin Sang used the "Dunling Jue" to conceal his cultivation, avoiding some trouble. He walked up the steps to the wooden hall of Dao Gate Peak.</p><p>The hall door was open, with disciples entering and exiting. Qin Sang went inside, but didn't see Senior Brother Wen, instead seeing a long-unseen acquaintance, Zhuang Yan!</p><p>"Senior Brother Zhuang."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Zhuang Yan had successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage. It seemed his years of hard cultivation had not been in vain.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin!"</p><p>Zhuang Yan was assigning tasks to a disciple when he looked up and saw Qin Sang.  A surprised expression immediately appeared on his face. He quickly dismissed the disciple and strode over, laughing heartily, "I heard from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield that you've already broken through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.  Calling you junior brother makes me feel quite uneasy! Thankfully, I didn't meet you in the past few years, otherwise I'd have to call you 'Master Uncle' for several years.  I wouldn't know where to put my face! Haha..."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled and playfully bowed, "Congratulations, Senior Brother Zhuang, a prodigal son returns... Where is Senior Brother Wen?"</p><p>Zhuang Yan shook his head, sighing, "Master is preparing to enjoy his remaining years and is no longer involved in worldly affairs.  Right now, he's probably playing chess with some old friend for leisure. I, as his disciple, have to do the hard work instead."</p><p>"Master?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly realized that Zhuang Yan had formally become Wen's disciple, receiving his care and guidance.</p><p>Their relationships were complex, but common in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang's use of "Senior Brother Wen" and "Senior Brother Zhuang" followed established cultivation world customs and personal relationships, allowing for flexibility as long as it didn't cause offense.</p><p>Zhuang Yan formally taking Wen as his master was a private matter.</p><p>The teacher-student bond was paramount; even if a disciple's cultivation surpassed their master's, they must still show proper respect.</p><p>Public and private matters were distinct.</p><p>They each maintained their own relationships.</p><p>Zhuang Yan pulled Qin Sang to a quiet room to sit. "Master was extremely pleased to hear about your breakthrough to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage. He was overjoyed! I'll immediately send a message to Master; he'll be very happy.  First, tell me about the real situation in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield..."</p><p>"Senior Brother Zhuang also intends to go to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to train?" Qin Sang picked up on the unspoken meaning.</p><p>Zhuang Yan nodded. "Staying in the sect is peaceful, but it's hard to achieve great accomplishments.  Going out for training provides opportunities for finding fortuitous encounters, and Master agrees."</p><p>Qin Sang saw envy in Zhuang Yan's eyes, guessing that he thought Qin Sang's breakthrough was due to a great fortuitous encounter in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. He didn't explain, and said thoughtfully, "Now isn't the best time for Senior Brother Zhuang to go to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. You should know about the approaching Spiritual Tide, right?"</p><p>Zhuang Yan uttered a sound of affirmation and leaned closer, whispering mysteriously, "There have been rumors recently, and the Qi Condensation disciples are discussing it. How could I not know? To cope with the situation, Senior Brother Qi is now managing sect affairs.  Sect Master Yu can only be a figurehead to prevent unrest among the disciples, which is why the sect master hasn't been changed. Furthermore, the sect is preparing to gather people to patrol Yun Cang Great Marsh. I'm hesitating between going to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield or staying at Yun Cang Great Marsh."</p><p>"With the impending Spiritual Tide, chaos is rising in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Compared to patrolling Yun Cang Great Marsh, it's hard to say which is more dangerous. However, we have the sect as our backing. If Senior Brother Zhuang makes up his mind, and considering the Spiritual Tide still needs time to brew, you can still try the Ancient Immortal Battlefield."</p><p>Then, Qin Sang detailed his experiences in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, leaving the decision to Zhuang Yan.</p><p>Zhuang Yan fell into deep thought, remaining silent for a long time.</p><p>From Zhuang Yan, Qin Sang learned that not only Shaohua Mountain, but also several major sects were organizing personnel to patrol Yun Cang Great Marsh and Tian Duan Mountain. Qin Sang truly felt the escalating tension.</p><p>He needed to carefully plan his future choices.</p><p>Not long after, Senior Brother Wen returned. The three reunited, talking happily until dusk, when Qin Sang bid them farewell and went to Baota Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang first selected several spells, intending to cultivate them later, then began searching through the vast collection of ancient books.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>A streak of light flew out from Baota Peak, heading towards a green peak at the edge of Shaohua Mountain's gates.</p><p>Although this green peak was inconspicuous among the mountains, it contained hidden potential, situated precisely on a spirit vein at the gate of Shaohua Mountain. While the peak wasn't majestic, it had several caves suitable for Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>The light circled the green peak once, stopping before the western cliff. The visitor was Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around the cliff face, waved his hand, and activated a restriction. A hidden entrance appeared in the rock wall. This was the cave dwelling chosen by Zhuang Yan after his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment stage; Qin Sang was temporarily borrowing it.</p><p>Entering the cave and sealing the restriction, Qin Sang recalled the previous night's work and shook his head.</p><p>He had toiled all night, but most of the information he found about Ziwei Palace was tenuous at best.</p><p>It seemed the truly valuable information wasn't on Baota Peak, and it might only circulate among Core Formation cultivators.  He wasn't yet at that level.</p><p>Another possibility was that Shaohua Mountain didn't know much about Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Ziwei Palace was exceptionally mysterious.  So many Nascent Soul ancestors had explored it, yet only a small portion had been uncovered.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang produced a jade slip given to him by Shopkeeper Wu.</p><p>He had only glanced at it before Shopkeeper Wu, without careful study. He vaguely sensed that the contents could help with his ebony sword, but he wasn't sure to what extent.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed this was due to the unique refinement method of the ebony sword.</p><p>According to the *Cultivating the Soul and Sword* manual, if he could find top-grade spirit wood, he could possess a treasure-level spirit sword by the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>This suggested that the method for refining a spirit sword detailed in the manual was designed for creating a treasure-level item from the start.</p><p>As the saying goes, "one can learn by analogy". It was not surprising that he found insights in the jade slip that were useful for refining his ebony sword.</p><p>The deeper Qin Sang delved, the more challenging it became.  A thorough understanding wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Qin Sang also realized the reason: he knew nothing about refining.  He didn't even know how to refine a magic item, yet he attempted to directly comprehend the jade slipâ€”a futile endeavor.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the notes left by Shopkeeper Wu's ancestor.</p><p>These notes were comparatively rudimentary, but to fully grasp them, he couldn't simply sit in the cave; he needed practical experience.</p><p>Should he take up refining?</p><p>It wouldn't be a complete waste.  Such experience would certainly help when refining his treasure-level weapon after reaching Core Formation, but he couldn't spare the energy now.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and put the jade slip into his pouch.</p><p>From then on, Qin Sang cultivated, visited friends, and dealt with miscellaneous matters.</p><p>Before he knew it, it was time to depart.</p>
