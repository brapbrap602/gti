<h1>Chapter 2039: Overlapping Formations</h1><p>Clear ripples undulated across the lake's surface.</p><p>Qin Sang sat alone, regulating his inner energies. His breath flowed long and deep, gradually merging with the natural rhythm of heaven and earth.</p><p>Two lake carp swam over, circling a decorative lake rock. Their tails flicked gently, as if in serene contentment.</p><p>Gradually, more and more fish gathered near the rock.</p><p>There was no bait to attract them, nor could they understand the reason, but they instinctively felt an unusual comfort here, lingering for a long time, unwilling to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered between wakefulness and sleep, imagining himself transforming into one of these fish, free from all worldly thoughts, preparing himself in peak condition to face a powerful foe.</p><p>Since leaving the tomb, he hadn't had a long secluded cultivation session to consolidate his gains. Although the Witch Clan's incantations weren't as violently disruptive as the Thunder Ancestor's empowerment, his foundation had still been affected.  However, because Qin Sang had achieved enlightenment before his cultivation surged, the impact remained within a manageable range, and he wasn't afraid of combat.</p><p>The setting sun painted the western sky as wild geese flew south.</p><p>With a splash, droplets scattered across the water's surface, and the school of fish dispersed in a flurry.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, his harmonious connection with nature broken.  He calmly watched a flying ship approach from the east.  The ship had a unique design, resembling a palace with two large, pure white plumes extending from its sides, flapping like wings as it sailed through the wind.</p><p>Within the palace:</p><p>A refined-looking man sat in a position of authority, his eyes closed in meditation.  It was Ling Du, the Second Palace Lord of the Departing Feather Palace.</p><p>The other cultivators sat on cushions below, the Azure Water Stronghold cultivators on one side and those from the Departing Feather Palace on the other.</p><p>In the past, although the Azure Water Stronghold's power was less than the Departing Feather Palace, they wouldn't have shown any weakness in their presence.  Now, having pledged their allegiance, they felt a subtle inferiority, their heads bowed, their morale low.</p><p>Suddenly, as if sensing something, Ling Du rose to his feet.  His eyes flashed brightly, and he roared, "Stop!"</p><p>The flying ship came to an abrupt halt.</p><p>Everyone was startled and confused.  They heard Ling Du command, "No one is to leave the White Feather Ship!"</p><p>Immediately, Ling Du projected a Dharma Body, transforming into a rainbow as he flew off.  Everyone rushed out of the palace to witness the rainbow streak across the sky, heading westward. Yet, the lake's surface remained calm, with no sign of anything unusual.</p><p>"What esteemed individual blocks my path!?"</p><p>A thunderous shout rolled across the water.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly rose. He saw the rainbow of light descend, revealing a figure in the distance – it was Ling Du, the Second Palace Lord of the Departing Feather Palace.</p><p>Rumor had it that this Second Palace Lord was fond of fine clothes and jade, and indeed, he appeared more like a mortal king than a cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't judge by appearances. With a quick assessment, he confirmed this man's considerable cultivation, just a step away from the mid-stage Soul Formation realm.  As for whether he could break through at any moment, as the rumors claimed, that couldn't be discerned from his appearance.</p><p>"I am Qin Sang. You must be Palace Lord Ling of the Departing Feather Palace," Qin Sang said, cupping his hands in a polite gesture.  "If Palace Lord Ling has come for the Azure Water Stronghold, you may return.  I will pay a visit to your esteemed palace another day."</p><p>Ling Du's gaze sharpened slightly.  He asked calmly, "Was it you who killed Recluse Zhong Liang? That old fox was shrewd and knew how to behave.  I wonder how he offended you?"</p><p>His tone betrayed no emotion, making it unclear whether it was a routine inquiry or a question on behalf of Recluse Zhong Liang.</p><p>Ling Du scrutinized Qin Sang, noticing that his cultivation was only slightly weaker than his own, but his aura seemed unstable, perhaps indicating an imperfect foundation.</p><p>How could such a person have killed Recluse Zhong Liang? Could there be other experts hidden within the Azure Water Stronghold?</p><p>"I did not personally kill Recluse Zhong Liang, but I was indeed present. As for the reason, Palace Lord Ling might inquire about why so many cultivators have perished within the Abundant Sorrow Jade Gate recently…"</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately left his words ambiguous, allowing Ling Du to fill in the gaps.</p><p>Lately, more and more news had emerged from the Abundant Sorrow Jade Gate.  Powerful cultivators gathered, and battles raged. Many who failed to escape or were driven by greed became collateral damage, never to emerge again.  Among them were renowned experts from Dui Prefecture and the Darklands. After this chaos, there was likely to be a significant power shift.</p><p>Ultimately, it was greed that drove these conflicts. Recluse Zhong Liang was probably no exception.</p><p>Ling Du glanced towards the western shore of the Jade Lake. The Azure Water Stronghold seemed unusually quiet. He suspected that Recluse Zhong Liang might have been injured in a treasure hunt within the Abundant Sorrow Jade Gate, allowing Qin Sang to seize the opportunity.</p><p>With Recluse Zhong Liang defeated and dead, the Azure Water Stronghold became Qin Sang's spoils of war.  However, the Departing Feather Palace couldn't tolerate an outsider controlling the Azure Water Stronghold and meddling in Jade Lake's affairs.  He declared, "I care not about your grievances with Recluse Zhong Liang. The current Sect Master of the Azure Water Stronghold has led the entire sect to join our palace, and a formal pact has been established. From now on, the Azure Water Stronghold is a subsidiary sect of the Departing Feather Palace."</p><p>He flicked his sleeve, revealing a written agreement that unfolded in the air, its characters glowing like lanterns.</p><p>"The pact is here, witnessed by heaven and earth. Do you still dare to obstruct me?" Palace Lord Ling roared.</p><p>"Without the sect's seal, this pact is but a worthless scrap of paper. Does Palace Lord Ling think such a simple trick can fool me?  Moreover, the Azure Water Stronghold's Sect Master acted in a moment of confusion.  Now, having seen the true situation, they have pledged allegiance to me," Qin Sang scoffed.</p><p>Ling Du snorted coldly, "Allegiance?  It looks more like forced occupation!  When a subsidiary sect faces hardship, the Departing Feather Palace will avenge them. Today, I will expel these ruffians from the Azure Water Stronghold and set things right!"</p><p>He took a forceful step forward, his aura surging like a monstrous tidal wave, crashing down upon Qin Sang.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Water erupted skyward, reaching thousands of feet.</p><p>The lake rock beneath Qin Sang's feet creaked under the immense pressure. His face hardened, but he showed no fear.  "Since Palace Lord Ling is so stubborn, we shall have to settle this with our fists!"</p><p>Both of them understood that a fight was inevitable.  Their arguments were merely justifications for their actions.</p><p>Before Qin Sang finished speaking, a dazzling golden light burst forth from Ling Du, like a miniature sun suspended in the air.  The light was as sharp as golden needles, causing a stinging sensation in the eyes.</p><p>Ling Du struck first.  Within the golden light was a small, exquisite golden hammer. Its head, perfectly round, transformed into a golden lightning bolt, appearing instantaneously above Qin Sang's head, aimed directly at his crown.</p><p>Even before the hammer arrived, Qin Sang's mind felt as if struck by a heavy blow, sending a shiver down his spine.  He dared not underestimate it.</p><p>The power of a single hammer strike could shatter mountains with ease.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The lake rock beneath Qin Sang crumbled, and the lake surface caved in, forming a large circular pit around him, exposing the lakebed.</p><p>Just as the golden hammer was about to strike Qin Sang's head, a deafening roar echoed, comparable to a clap of thunder.</p><p>Ling Du's expression shifted slightly.  He changed his hand seals, directing the golden hammer to fly back and hover before him. He stared at Qin Sang, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang held a spirit tablet-shaped spiritual treasure in one hand.  The tablet was as large as a stone stele, heavy and imposing. With a single swing, Qin Sang had repelled the golden hammer.</p><p>"A Physical Cultivator?"</p><p>In the vast world, among humans, Dharma Cultivators were the mainstream.</p><p>Although Ling Du was surprised, he wasn't overly astonished.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang roared, soaring into the air like a ferocious beast, launching a fierce attack.  The enormous spirit tablet seemed disproportionate to his body, but in his hands, it was as light as a feather, swirling with incredible force.</p><p>This spirit tablet was obtained from Patriarch Ming Hu, which Qin Sang had kept as his own weapon.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't summon his Azure Roc Dharma Idol but instead merged it with his true body. He secretly circulated the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, feeling an immense power coursing through his being.</p><p>Ling Du, believing he had gauged Qin Sang's strength, didn't change his tactics. He formed a single-handed seal, brushing it over the golden hammer.</p><p>The hammer expanded to the size of a mountain, hurtling towards the spirit tablet in a head-on collision.</p><p>The aura of the two combatants clashed without reservation, instantly alerting the surrounding powers around Jade Lake.</p><p>Hidden gazes focused on the battle at the lake's center.</p><p>…</p><p>Azure Water Stronghold.</p><p>Having lost their final layer of protection, the Azure Water Stronghold disciples were easily subdued by Su Nu and the others.</p><p>The sect gates were sealed again, and the concealing mist reformed. However, the Azure Water Stronghold had changed hands.</p><p>Above the main stronghold:</p><p>All the Azure Water Stronghold disciples were imprisoned, bound by restrictions, their anger simmering beneath the surface.</p><p>Su Nu ignored their glares and selected the true disciples of Recluse Zhong Liang, subjecting them to interrogation techniques.  Soon, the Azure Water Stronghold held no more secrets.</p><p>From these disciples, she retrieved several unique wooden tokens, which she handed to Xin Sheng. "These tokens grant access to the formation's core.  Quickly take control of the protective formation!"</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Xin Sheng and the others took the tokens and retreated. Su Nu also remained busy, making various arrangements in preparation for a potential battle with the Departing Feather Palace.</p><p>As long as they controlled the formation and defended the Azure Water Stronghold, with her and Qin Sang working together, even if all three Palace Lords of the Departing Feather Palace arrived, breaching their defenses would be difficult.</p><p>Despite her busy schedule, Su Nu spared a sliver of her attention to observe the battle at the lake's center.</p><p>Towards Qin Sang, Su Nu felt both gratitude and curiosity.</p><p>During the Seven Kills Hall's demon-sealing battle, Qin Sang had initially displayed extraordinary abilities. Now, having successfully broken free from the limitations of the Small World, ascended to the Great Thousand World, and stepped into the Soul Formation realm, he was truly a rare and exceptional talent.</p><p>But Su Nu had achieved the same.</p><p>She wanted to know what other qualities Qin Sang possessed that warranted the Sovereign's attention, to the extent of sending her here at great cost, instructing her to wait in the Abundant Sorrow Jade Gate.</p><p>Upon learning the news, General Bai had even personally rushed over.</p><p>It was clear they shared a past connection.  This puzzled Su Nu even further. If they were old acquaintances, why didn't they meet?</p><p>General Bai had ordered her to assist Qin Sang, and his tone didn't suggest any ill intentions towards him.</p><p>What was the hidden truth behind all this?</p><p>Unable to unravel the mystery, Su Nu focused on watching the fight.</p><p>…</p><p>Lake Center.</p><p>Qin Sang's muscles bulged as he swung the spirit tablet with powerful strikes.  Within a single breath, he clashed with the golden hammer over a dozen times, causing the surrounding area to tremble and waves to surge.</p><p>Compared to the typical Dharma Cultivator battles, this direct, forceful exchange was indeed more invigorating.  However, this wasn't Qin Sang's primary goal. He also wanted to use Ling Du to test his newly comprehended sword techniques.</p><p>Ling Du continued his relentless assault with the golden hammer.  Seeing Qin Sang's ferocious momentum, which he couldn't suppress, he started considering a change in tactics.</p><p>As the golden hammer's momentum slowed, Qin Sang immediately sensed it, pressing his attack like a raging storm, closing the distance between them.</p><p>Although Ling Du was only present as a Dharma Body, being cornered by a Physical Cultivator would severely restrict his options.</p><p>Yet, he seemed unfazed by Qin Sang's advance.  His lips moved slightly, and his right index finger, imbued with spiritual light, traced a circle in the air before his chest.</p><p>Just as the final stroke was about to complete, Ling Du suddenly sensed something amiss.  A warning sign flashed in his mind. He immediately stopped the secret technique, but it was too late.  A sword cry echoed.  Before he could even see the sword's shadow, his vision abruptly darkened.</p><p>In a fleeting instant, starlight dispelled the darkness.  Ling Du found himself within a starry expanse.</p><p>"A Sword Cultivator!"</p><p>Only then did Ling Du feel true surprise. This person cultivated both body and Dharma, and he was a Sword Cultivator!</p><p>Once a Sword Cultivator made a move, their attacks were bound to be incredibly swift and fierce. Even if he had been prepared, he might not have been able to evade the sword formation, let alone when his judgment had been clouded by the opponent's initial display of physical prowess.</p><p>Trapped within the sword formation, Ling Du knew he had been outmaneuvered.  From now on, he would likely be forced into a defensive stance.</p><p>Among the cultivators of the Great Thousand World, Sword Cultivators were undoubtedly among the most undesirable opponents. Once they gained the upper hand, their sword strikes became progressively faster, like a storm of thunder and lightning, leaving their opponents with no chance to breathe.</p><p>However, Ling Du showed no fear.</p><p>In his view, if his opponent were a pure Sword Cultivator, they wouldn't have bothered with such deceptive tactics.  They would have unleashed a devastating sword strike from the start, without any of these elaborate maneuvers.</p><p>At their level of cultivation, seeking and comprehending the Dao, dabbling in too many disciplines might not be beneficial.</p><p>Since his opponent wasn't a pure Sword Cultivator, he might be able to find a weakness in the sword formation.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, surveying the surrounding stars.  He understood that they were all transformed from sword essence. Although he didn't know which star concealed the spiritual sword, he could tell that they represented the Seven Western Constellations.</p><p>Starlight flickered, spiritual energy locking onto Ling Du.</p><p>Instantly, the sword stars moved in unison, radiating intense sword intent.  Thousands of sword lights traversed the void, poised to strike.</p><p>Ling Du remained calm and unmoving.  He raised the golden hammer above his head, its striking surface facing upwards, gathering power for a counterattack, ready to meet the incoming sword lights.</p><p>Simultaneously, he opened his palm, revealing a handful of fine sand that had appeared there at some point. The sand grains were multicolored, as if formed from fragments of various jades.  The fine sand rose, circling around Ling Du, forming a ring of sand.</p><p>Then, to Qin Sang's surprise, Ling Du sat down cross-legged in the midst of the sword formation, seemingly oblivious to the imminent danger.  His fingers flicked repeatedly, sending streaks of spiritual light into the sand ring, causing the multicolored grains to shimmer like tinkling jade pendants.</p><p>Meanwhile, the sword lights descended, like a celestial river pouring down from the heavens.</p><p>The golden hammer vibrated, launching a fierce counter-attack.</p><p>Rumbling echoes and flashes of lightning filled the formation, conjuring terrifying visions.</p><p>Ling Du remained as steady as a mountain, focusing on manipulating the fine sand.  However, he soon felt the golden hammer struggling to hold back the onslaught.  His Dharma Body experienced a faint stinging sensation.  He frowned but didn't stop his secret technique.  The robes on his back billowed upwards, transforming into a cloud of smoke above his head.</p><p>The golden hammer and the cloud of smoke, one firm, one yielding.</p><p>The combined defense of his robes and the hammer proved formidable.  Despite Qin Sang's relentless attacks, he couldn't break through.  Instead of shifting to a different sword formation, Qin Sang closed his eyes, as if comprehending something profound.</p><p>Just then, Ling Du finally completed his secret technique.  He rose to his feet, his hand closing into a fist, gathering the fine sand into his palm.  Then, he tossed it upwards.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The fine sand scattered like flower petals, spreading across the starry expanse, also transforming into stars.</p><p>Multicolored spiritual lights filled every corner of the void.  Although they weren't as bright as the sword stars, their sheer number gave them an advantage.</p><p>As these sand stars mingled with the sword stars, the sword starlight became disrupted.  Ling Du's eyes gleamed. Although the sword stars quickly stabilized, he had glimpsed a clue, a confident smile spreading across his face. He summoned a jade ring and hurled it towards a specific point in the void.</p><p>The void trembled.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes. He didn't try to stop Ling Du from breaking the formation. With a flick of his finger, he manifested the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation.</p><p>Guided by the insights from the Sword Path, the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation had finally reached completion.  Furthermore, with a true Vermilion Bird residing within, its power surpassed the Seven Constellations Sword Formation representing the Seven Western Constellations.</p><p>Ling Du emerged from the Seven Western Constellations only to find another sword formation blocking his path. He was about to repeat his previous tactic.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang didn't continue to develop the Four Symbols Formation.  With a thought, the Western sword stars transformed into shooting stars, hurtling towards the Southern star domain.</p><p>This was another insight he gained within the Sword Path - overlapping formations. Before the Four Symbols Sword Formation was fully realized, this was perhaps the most effective method of utilization!</p>
