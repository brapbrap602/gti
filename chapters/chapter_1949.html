<h1>Chapter 1940: Descending the Mountain</h1><p>Chen Xiucai and Yu Chenghuang were both eloquent men, while Yi Panguan and Liu Daifu played the perfect supporting roles.</p><p>Qin Sang occasionally interjected a few words, but mostly listened to their conversation with relish, accompanying it with occasional sips of wine.</p><p>This table, gathered with mortals and immortals, was a truly unique experience.</p><p>‘Sizzle… sizzle…’</p><p>Qin Sang personally took the knife, grilling the meat over charcoal until slightly charred, sprinkling seasoning powder with each movement precise and delicate, every detail perfectly executed.</p><p>After grilling, he took out a few skewers and handed them to his disciples.</p><p>The four little ones gathered in the corner, their mouths glistening with grease.</p><p>“You guys… on the mountain… Ow, it’s burning me!”</p><p>Tao Teng inhaled sharply, unwilling to spit out the meat, swallowing it with difficulty, feeling the flavor penetrate to his very bones.</p><p>Whether from the heat or envy, Tao Teng's eyes reddened as he looked at Yu Lang. “Truly… a celestial life!”</p><p>The bookboy Ming Yan nodded vigorously in agreement.</p><p>“Just eat yours!”</p><p>Yu Lang tossed Tao Teng a spirit fruit, silencing him.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Someone was frantically knocking on the door.</p><p>Liu Daifu was startled, while Yu Chenghuang and Yi Panguan turned to look.</p><p>Qin Sang said it was nothing, got up, and opened the door. Zhuque, the vermillion bird, flew in furtively.</p><p>Having been taught a lesson several times, it had finally learned its place and didn't make a fuss, staring intently at the meat in Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>Qin Sang had already prepared a plate for it. Zhuque, ignoring everyone else, buried its head and devoured the meat.</p><p>Everyone at the table watched Zhuque gorge itself.</p><p>“Even a little bird loves it, the taste must be exceptional,” Liu Daifu chuckled.</p><p>Zhuque glared at him and continued its feast.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang and Yi Panguan kept observing Zhuque, astonished to find that they couldn't even see through a bird in the Daoist temple?</p><p>Composing themselves, Yu Chenghuang picked up a skewer, sniffed it lightly, and imitating Qin Sang, bit off a piece directly from the skewer.</p><p>Having come from a scholarly family, he had been strictly disciplined since childhood. This crude manner of eating was a first for him, and he felt somewhat awkward.</p><p>Chen Xiucai was initially the same, but quickly adapted, and even praised this way of eating, declaring that this was the way it should be done.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang savored the taste carefully.</p><p>Chen Xiucai stared at him, waiting for him to swallow.  Smugly, he asked, “Brother Yu, how is the flavor? Did I exaggerate even a little?”</p><p>“Truly heavenly!”</p><p>Yu Chenghuang was generous with his praise.</p><p>“The Drunken Fragrance Feast at the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant, famed as the best in Jiangnan, pales in comparison to this simple skewer of meat.”</p><p>Yi Panguan echoed, though inwardly he scoffed, thinking to himself, ‘Just look at the ingredients used, how could it not be delicious?’</p><p>His gaze swept over the mortals in the room. Having consumed so many potent spirit herbs and fruits, they hadn't exploded. Clearly, this temple master had subtly intervened, allowing them to slowly absorb the medicinal power, at least strengthening their bodies and benefiting them for life.</p><p>“What's the Drunken Fragrance Feast?” Chen Xiucai asked, bewildered. He had been to the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant many times but had never heard of such a feast.</p><p>“The owner of the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant was once an imperial chef. It's said he offended some villain in the palace and was forced to retire, returning to Jindian County to open the restaurant. Only the owner can prepare the Drunken Fragrance Feast, and he has yet to pass on the art.  He's getting old now, and can only make it a few times a year, only for his old acquaintances,” Yu Chenghuang sipped his wine, savoring the blend of wine, meat, and herbal fragrance.</p><p>“Another recluse! Our Jindian County deserves to be called the City of Recluses! The County of Recluses! We must raise a toast!”</p><p>Inspired, Chen Xiucai suddenly slammed the table, downing the wine in his cup.</p><p>He drank several cups in a row, his demeanor becoming increasingly unrestrained.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang glanced at Qin Sang and thought to himself, ‘Indeed.’  “It's not only a county of recluses, but also a pool of hidden dragons. Brother Chen, you should be descending the mountain for the autumn examinations next year, shouldn't you?”</p><p>As the City God of Jindian County, Yu Chenghuang also paid attention to the talented scholars under his jurisdiction. He knew that this Chen Xiucai was quite learned, but unfortunately, his talents had gone unrecognized, failing the examinations repeatedly.</p><p>Chen Xiucai gave a wry smile.  “In my youth, I considered myself extraordinary, yet failed the examinations time and again. Seeing my classmates all enjoying success, I could only feign aloofness, wearing a mask to hide my last shred of dignity. I was never a true recluse, so how can there be talk of descending the mountain?”</p><p>“With such a heart, I believe Brother Chen will eventually achieve his aspirations,” Qin Sang toasted Chen Xiucai, and the others drank along.</p><p>No one offered any words of consolation. Chen Xiucai's willingness to reveal his shortcomings indicated he needed no comfort.</p><p>Chen Xiucai accepted the toast calmly, stood up, and looked out the window.  “In my youthful arrogance, I loved to speak shocking words. Now, I no longer yearn for titles or fame in history. If I'm fortunate enough to pass the examinations and govern a region, I only wish to not fail the people, not fail the Emperor, not shame Heaven and Earth, and not shame my own heart!”</p><p>…</p><p>Wine cups clinked in the attic of the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>People bustled in Jindian County.</p><p>The teahouse should have been even more lively than the streets.</p><p>Yet, when the young girl entered the teahouse, she felt a strange stillness. Everyone was completely engrossed in listening to the storyteller.</p><p>The tea servers walked with the lightest of steps, pouring tea with utmost care to avoid making a sound.</p><p>The patrons rarely spoke, forgetting even the food and tea in front of them.</p><p>Only when the storyteller struck the gavel did the patrons snap out of their trance, drinking tea and conversing, creating a momentary stir, but even their voices were as soft as whispers.</p><p>The storyteller's voice resonated throughout the teahouse, seemingly drowning out the outside noise.</p><p>“What story holds such captivating power?”</p><p>The young girl, marveling at this sight, gazed past the patrons and saw the storyteller on stage.</p><p>Just as the auntie outside had described, he wore a gray robe, had a youthful face, and an average build.  His appearance was unremarkable, the kind that would be lost in a crowd.</p><p>The storyteller also noticed the young girl entering. Seeing her approach, he smiled slightly and nodded in greeting.</p><p>The girl couldn't help but smile back.</p><p>A tea server approached with a teapot. After a brief exchange of glances, he led the girl to an empty table.</p><p>“It is said that when the Nine Heavens Goddess descended to the mortal realm, the Heavenly Mother happened to send the Azure Bird with a decree, secretly instructing it that if the Nine Heavens Goddess remained obstinate, it should use its magic to escort her to the Heavenly Pool.  Unexpectedly, the Azure Bird yearned for the mortal realm, and was easily persuaded by the Nine Heavens Goddess to descend with her…”</p><p>So it was a mythological tale.</p><p>The girl thought, following the tea server and taking a seat, but she didn't notice that the kingfisher on her shoulder had perked up and flapped its wings when it heard the mention of the Azure Bird.</p><p>‘Chirp… chirp…’</p><p>The kingfisher flew up, seemingly entranced.</p><p>Round and round it flew, tirelessly.</p><p>Its plumage shed shimmering azure specks of light, and its chirps blended perfectly into the storyteller's narrative, transforming into the Azure Bird of the story, immersing everyone in the scene.</p><p>None of the listeners, including the girl, found this strange.</p><p>The girl, completely oblivious to her companion, sat down and focused intently on the storyteller, listening to the captivating tale.</p><p>In a trance, she felt as if she had become the Nine Heavens Goddess herself.</p><p>Her master was the heartless Heavenly Mother.</p><p>Every action and encounter of the Nine Heavens Goddess after descending to the mortal realm tugged at her heartstrings.</p><p>When the Nine Heavens Goddess rejoiced, she beamed with joy.</p><p>When the Nine Heavens Goddess grieved, tears streamed down her face.</p><p>…</p><p>The girl forgot she was in a teahouse, forgot everything around her, lost in the world crafted by the storyteller.</p><p>Not long after the girl entered the teahouse, a sudden gust of Yin wind swept past the entrance. A figure, invisible to ordinary eyes, flickered in the shadows.</p><p>This figure, clad in armor, was a ghost god under the command of the Jindian County City God, and not a low-ranking one either. It was the Day Wanderer God, second only to the City God and the Civil and Military Judges, on par with the heads of various departments and generals.</p><p>“She went in?”</p><p>Two Yin emissaries, who had been standing where the Day Wanderer God materialized, bowed in unison and replied, “Yes.”</p><p>The young girl must have a method of concealing her aura, as she had evaded the Yin emissaries guarding the city gates, but she was still detected by the divine artifacts within the City God Temple.</p><p>Unfortunately, the main officials were all absent today.</p><p>The City God and the Civil Judge had gone out on patrol together, while the Military Judge personally led troops out of the city to hunt down a demonic creature.</p><p>The Day Wanderer God and the heads of the various departments, unable to ascertain the young girl's origins, dared not act rashly. Seeing her innocent and carefree demeanor, with no apparent malicious intent, the Day Wanderer God had gone out of the city to consult with the Military Judge.</p><p>The two ghost soldiers were ordered to wait here.</p><p>“Yes, she entered the teahouse and hasn't come out,” one Yin emissary hesitated, “Something strange is happening inside. My lord, you should see for yourself.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The Day Wanderer God frowned, and led the two Yin emissaries, quietly passing through the curtain. At that moment, the storyteller happened to be narrating the part where the Nine Heavens Goddess encountered danger.</p><p>“The Heavenly Mother dispatched heavenly soldiers and generals, searching the entire world. No matter how cautious the Nine Heavens Goddess and the Azure Bird were, they ultimately couldn't escape their fate.  At Lianyang Mountain, they were finally discovered by a squad of heavenly soldiers.  Alas, the immortal seals bestowed upon the Nine Heavens Goddess and the Azure Bird upon their descent had yet to dissolve, their powers only restored to thirty percent. Another fierce battle awaited…”</p><p>The kingfisher had somehow returned to the young girl’s shoulder, as engrossed in the story as its master, its expression filled with anxiety.</p><p>The Day Wanderer God and the two Yin emissaries, having just stepped into the teahouse, were startled to see the storyteller nod towards them.</p><p>At that moment, their chests swelled with heroic fervor, as if they had transformed into heavenly soldiers and generals themselves, tasked by the Heavenly Mother to apprehend criminals and carry out divine justice!</p><p>They completely forgot the purpose of their visit, walked to another empty table, and sat down, their backs ramrod straight, their eyes gleaming.</p><p>The story continued.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang and Yi Panguan, back at the Green Ram Temple, were completely unaware of these events.</p><p>The feast lasted from early morning until afternoon before finally concluding.</p><p>Liu Daifu stayed the night at the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Chen Xiucai, Yu Chenghuang, and the others descended the mountain together, bidding each other farewell outside the bamboo forest.</p><p>Chen Xiucai offered to send them off in his carriage, but Yu and Yi declined.</p><p>After parting ways, the two divine beings vanished into thin air, reappearing on a mountain not far from the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>“Greetings, my lords.”</p><p>The local Earth God, having been waiting there for some time, hurriedly bowed.</p><p>Yi Panguan said, “We have met with that Daoist Qingfeng. He is truly extraordinary. Be careful in your dealings with him, carry out any requests he may have, and do not disturb him otherwise.”</p><p>The Earth God was astonished. “May I ask, what is the Daoist's background?”</p><p>Yi Panguan looked at Yu Chenghuang.  For some reason, Yu Chenghuang hadn't inquired about these matters.</p><p>“I fear even the officials of the prefecture would treat this person with utmost respect.  It's hard to say whether it's a blessing or a curse that such a person is living in seclusion in Jindian County.”</p><p>Yu Chenghuang sighed.  “Regardless of his identity or cultivation, simply treat him as a powerful being experiencing the mortal world.”</p><p>The Earth God responded with a confused, “Yes.”</p><p>Yi Panguan glanced at the Earth God and said gravely, “With such figures, everything depends on fate. Before fate arrives, all is illusion.  Do not think that diligent service will earn you any favors. Be careful not to overdo it.”</p><p>His thoughts exposed, the Earth God shuddered.  “Thank you for your warning, my lord. I almost made a grave mistake.”</p><p>“There's no need to be so overly cautious. I observed that this person has an easygoing temperament.  Just let things unfold naturally,” Yu Chenghuang added a few more instructions, and then departed for the county city with Yi Panguan.</p><p>…</p><p>“What did you say? The Day and Night Wanderer Gods, as well as the Soul Summoners, are all trapped in the teahouse?”</p><p>When Yu Chenghuang and Yi Panguan returned to the county city, the Military Judge had also just returned from his demon hunt.  They joined forces, only to receive a message via spirit talisman.</p><p>Seeing the contents of the talisman, the three officials’ faces paled.</p><p>It turned out that after the Day Wanderer God entered the teahouse, he had vanished without a trace.  The Night Wanderer God and the Soul Summoners, who went to search for him, were also trapped inside.</p><p>Then, several heads of other departments also disappeared.</p><p>The teahouse door seemed like a giant maw, swallowing all ghost gods who entered.</p><p>As more and more ghost gods vanished, finally a Yin emissary realized something was amiss.</p><p>“Preposterous! I’ll see what kind of demon dares to act so recklessly within the city!”</p><p>The Military Judge roared in fury, flicking his sleeve. All the ghost soldiers transformed into a gust of Yin wind, rushing towards the city.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang and Yi Panguan exchanged a look, seeing the same apprehension in each other's eyes.</p><p>How could it be such a coincidence?</p><p>Trouble had arisen in the city right after their visit to Daoist Qingfeng.</p><p>By now, the teahouse was surrounded by layers of Yin emissaries, who had cast a spell to isolate it from the mortal world.</p><p>Ordinary people remained oblivious, the streets still bustling with activity, yet they all subconsciously ignored the teahouse.</p><p>The storyteller's resonant voice drifted out, narrating the pursuit of the Nine Heavens Goddess and the Azure Bird by heavenly soldiers and generals.</p><p>This chase was thrilling and captivating.</p><p>All the ghost gods in the city were present, yet none dared to step foot inside the teahouse.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gust of Yin wind descended from the sky. Yu Chenghuang and the two Judges finally arrived. After listening to their subordinates' report, they approached the teahouse entrance.</p><p>The curtain was made of bamboo, and through the gaps, they could vaguely see the scene inside.</p><p>The young girl, the Azure Bird, and the multitude of ghost gods, all with varying expressions, were completely immersed in the story.</p><p>“Deploy the Mountain Quelling Spirit Banners!”</p><p>The Military Judge whispered.</p><p>Outside the teahouse, a squad of ghost gods retreated upon receiving the order, fetching nine black banners, each three zhang long, and planting them around the teahouse.</p><p>The ghost gods divided into nine teams, gathering beneath the banners, with the main banner erected behind the Military Judge.</p><p>Nine banners formed an array, capable of suppressing all cultivators and demonic creatures!</p><p>Yu Chenghuang nodded at Yi Panguan.  Yi Panguan stepped forward, lifting the curtain, but didn't cross the threshold.</p><p>The curtain was half-lifted.</p><p>The three officials saw the storyteller, and at the same time, the storyteller looked up at them.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang opened his mouth, about to speak.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The storyteller slammed the gavel. “The heavenly soldiers and generals were forced to retreat by the Nine Heavens Goddess’s cunning, suffering a crushing defeat.  Just as the Nine Heavens Goddess and the Azure Bird rejoiced, they were unaware of the approaching danger!  The Three Star Lords had arrived with their troops.  This tribulation would be difficult to overcome!”</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Fire Domain Daoist grounds.</p><p>Qin Sang’s true body, in the midst of comprehending the sword array, suddenly awoke.  He gazed southwards, his expression gradually turning grave.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, left his cave dwelling, sent a message to Marquis Gui, and vanished in a flash of lightning.
