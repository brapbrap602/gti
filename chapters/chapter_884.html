<h1>Chapter 876 Fang Ting</h1><p>Chapter 876 Fang Ting</p><p>His external projection was too far from his true body to sense it.</p><p>Qin Sang dared to send his external projection in because it inherited the memories of his true body and could act independently, the only differences being cultivation level and physical form.</p><p>Of course, to be safe, Qin Sang had hidden some key secrets, such as his origins and the existence of the jade Buddha.</p><p>The external projection, wielding bamboo leaf artifacts, traversed mountains and rivers, flying towards Yanmiao Pavilion.</p><p>Yanmiao Pavilion was located on an island in a vast lake deep within the Landou Mountains.  The sect was known for its water-based spells and enjoyed some local fame, thanks to the Landou Sect.</p><p>After flying for some time, the external projection found a place to rest and recover its qi before continuing on its journey.</p><p>It was still some distance from Yanmiao Pavilion.</p><p>The external projection looked towards the horizon. The mountains seemed to thin out, and a faint mist rose in the distance – the lake.</p><p>At that moment, the flying external projection suddenly stopped, hovering in mid-air on its bamboo leaf artifact, turning to look to the left.</p><p>It was nearing noon, the sun high in the sky.</p><p>Most of the mountain mist had dissipated, revealing lush, ancient trees filling the valleys between the peaks. Birds sang, beasts called – a vibrant scene.</p><p>As Qin Sang looked over, the crowns of the ancient trees in the forest shook violently, followed by a whooshing sound. A small figure appeared in Qin Sang's vision.</p><p>A young woman with short hair was flying towards them on a sword. Judging by her direction, she was probably also heading to Yanmiao Pavilion.</p><p>Their eyes met. The girl paused, momentarily startled, and stopped her sword.</p><p>"Cultivation Stage Eighth Layer..."</p><p>The external projection thought to himself.</p><p>Without needing any spells, the Sky Eye Butterfly instantly revealed the girl's cultivation level.</p><p>The girl seemed quite young. To have such high cultivation at her age suggested exceptional talent, likely also attending Yanmiao Pavilion's recruitment ceremony.</p><p>The external projection gave his competitor a long look, then silently departed.</p><p>Yanmiao Pavilion's recruitment wasn't through martial combat or the bloody battles of the Yuanzhao Sect. No matter how talented the girl was, it wouldn't affect him.</p><p>Initially wary, the girl's expression changed when she saw the direction of the external projection's flight.  She followed, calling out, "Friend, please wait..."</p><p>The external projection frowned slightly, slowing his flight and turning to the girl.</p><p>"My name is Fang Ting. What is your name, friend? Are you also going to Yanmiao Pavilion's recruitment ceremony?"</p><p>The short-haired girl quickly caught up, her cheeks flushed, introducing herself.</p><p>She had large eyes and a bright smile, revealing two small canine teeth.</p><p>"My surname is Zhang, and my given name is Yue," the external projection replied kindly, not being dismissive. He thought the girl would likely be accepted by Yanmiao Pavilion, and building a relationship might be useful.</p><p>"Miss Fang, you're also planning to join Yanmiao Pavilion, right?"</p><p>Fang Ting nodded repeatedly. "Like Brother Zhang, I'm also going to Yanmiao Pavilion's recruitment ceremony. Since we've met on the way, why not go together?  I heard that Landou Mountain isn't entirely safe.  The Landou Sect, to test its disciples, hasn't completely cleared the smaller monsters. Some beasts are very difficult to deal with."</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>The external projection feigned surprise. "I haven't encountered any beasts on my journey, I guess I've been lucky. Miss Fang seems very familiar with this area."</p><p>Fang Ting modestly replied, "Not really. I live on a small island not far from Landou Island and have heard some rumors. Brother Zhang, aren't you a cultivator from Landou Island?"</p><p>"No, I'm a solitary cultivator from Lu Island. I heard that a major sect here is recruiting disciples, so I came..."</p><p>The external projection told the truth, not hiding his origins.</p><p>After hearing the location of Lu Island, Fang Ting was amazed, admiring his courage in traveling such a distance.</p><p>After a brief conversation, the external projection agreed to travel together, and the two flew towards Yanmiao Pavilion.</p><p>Fang Ting seemed very innocent, and her conversation was full of naivete.</p><p>However, the external projection knew that a girl her age with such cultivation wouldn't be completely guileless; her demeanor was likely an act.</p><p>Still, as long as the girl didn't harbor ill will towards him, he didn't mind.</p><p>The two chatted happily and quickly became acquainted.</p><p>On their journey, they encountered a common-level demonic monkey.  Working together, they killed it and divided the corpse. Fang Ting laughed even brighter, her eyes curving into crescents.</p><p>The external projection didn't care for the spoils but pretended to be pleased and put them away.</p><p>This battle further increased Fang Ting's trust in the external projection.</p><p>"Brother Zhang, you're so young and have such high cultivation, and your swordsmanship is excellent. You'll definitely be chosen by Yanmiao Pavilion!"</p><p>Fang Ting reassured the external projection.</p><p>The avatar shook his head slowly, saying in a low voice, "My talent isn't particularly good. I just had a stroke of luck during my travels, leading to a sudden surge in cultivation. But I've nearly exhausted my potential. I don't know if I can even break through to the tenth level, let alone establish a foundation.  I may not even meet the standards of the Yanmiao Pavilion. Miss Fang, you are truly gifted. If you are accepted into a major sect, don't forget about Zhang."</p><p>Fang Ting's face flushed slightly, and she said somewhat embarrassedly, "I don't know if I'll be chosen... Brother Zhang, don't lose heart. People often say that talent isn't everything.  Your significant improvement shows you have excellent fortune; you'll surely have more opportunities in the future."</p><p>The avatar nodded silently, observing Fang Ting subtly.</p><p>No matter how deep a young girl's scheming, it couldn't escape the eyes of an old monster like him.</p><p>Fang Ting spoke of failing the selection, yet her expression clearly showed a certain degree of confidence.  Whether this was due to genuine talent or some other advantage, he couldn't tell.</p><p>They flew and chatted, crossing mountains and valleys, until they unknowingly arrived at their destination.</p><p>Between two mountains, shimmering waters appeared. They exchanged glances, accelerated, and flew over the mountains. Suddenly, a vast lake opened before them.</p><p>In the center of the lake, mist swirled, vaguely revealing a sizable island with pavilions, towers, lush forests, and bamboo groves.</p><p>This mist, dense yet never dissipating, moved with a certain regularity, clearly not naturally occurring.</p><p>"This is the Yanmiao Pavilion! We're finally here!"</p><p>Fang Ting cheered joyfully, then her gaze swept across the area.  She pointed to the distance and exclaimed, "There are people there!"</p><p>The avatar saw them too: a large expanse of blue stones on the lakeshore, with dozens of figures, sitting or standing, gathered together, doing something.</p><p>A message from a Sky Eye Butterfly revealed that these people were mostly Qi Refining cultivators, likely like them, attending the apprentice selection ceremony.</p><p>Among them was a Foundation Establishment cultivator—a man in a green robe sitting on the highest stone, wearing a Yanmiao Pavilion disciple's token.</p><p>"Holding the apprentice selection ceremony in such a desolate place seems rather... frugal,"</p><p>The avatar muttered to himself, then called to Fang Ting and flew toward the group.</p>
