<h1>Chapter 1921: A World in Turmoil</h1><p>Qin Sang had narrowed down the possible locations of the altars to three areas. One was west of the Lei Xiao Sect, and that's where they were headed.</p><p>They traversed towering mountains and arrived in a new country. Sometimes they flew through the air, sometimes they descended to the earth, visiting mortals or spirits.  Their progress was faster than before; Qin Sang was eager to find the altars and uncover their true origins and purpose.</p><p>The lands they passed through, while perhaps not prosperous, were at least peaceful. The people were able to make a living.</p><p>But as they journeyed further west, things started to change.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a growing tension in the border towns; war was a frequent occurrence.</p><p>Further west still, they encountered ruined cities and deserted villages, devoid of life.</p><p>Especially in the remote areas, temples and statues lay in ruins, devoid of worshipers. Some statues were decapitated, others reduced to dust, the air heavy with desolation.</p><p>The power of the divine realm weakened with each step.</p><p>In some places, a county god's power was inferior not only to Gao Ruoxu's, but even to a normal county god in Liu State.</p><p>Demons descended from the mountains to prey on humans. The local deities dared not leave the towns to subdue them, and even powerful demons caused them great fear for their safety.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the warning of the head of the Yan Shui Temple. As they traveled west, they drew closer to the Mu Luo Mountains, a region teeming with countless demons and rife with chaos. Even the cultivators of Yun Du Mountain spoke of it with fear, and even Yun Du Tian could not pacify the Mu Luo Mountains.</p><p>It seemed the mortal world was also affected by the cultivation world. Areas closer to Yun Du Tian were more stable.</p><p>Following this trend, the situation ahead could only worsen!</p><p>Qin Sang's prediction proved accurate.</p><p>One day,</p><p>as they flew overhead, Qin Sang’s gaze swept across the ground below. He suddenly pointed to a mountaintop ahead.</p><p>"Land there."</p><p>Luo Hou immediately retracted the demonic wind, gently alighting on the peak. Qin Sang and Xiao Wu dismounted. The scene before them unfolded.</p><p>The place was clearly parched; it hadn't rained in a long time.</p><p>The mountain was barren. Where there was any grass, it was a scorched yellow, devoid of any green or moisture, readily flammable, even though it wasn't autumn yet.</p><p>The sun was beginning to set, and the earth still reeked of burnt things.</p><p>A dirt road wound down the mountain.</p><p>Hot winds whipped up the yellow earth, sending dust swirling.</p><p>The road was relatively flat and wide, not a rough mountain path like those used by ordinary people. It had once been a government road, meticulously constructed.</p><p>Despite the sun's heat, the road was teeming with people, relentlessly moving forward, heedless of the sun and dust.</p><p>These were not merchants nor soldiers.</p><p>Almost all were gaunt and thin, their clothes tattered and dirty. Some were so emaciated they barely stood, trembling, ready to collapse at any moment, having abandoned all their possessions except for a walking stick, their only support a desperate will to keep going.</p><p>They shielded themselves with scraps of cloth and leaves, some exposed directly to the sun, their expressions vacant, like walking corpses.</p><p>Clearly, these were refugees.</p><p>Behind them stretched a long line of people, a winding river of humanity.</p><p>So many people fleeing their homes; a great famine or war must have broken out ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang was familiar with such sights, having witnessed them before he entered the cultivation world.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A hot wind swept in from somewhere, whipping up a massive cloud of dust.</p><p>"Cough…"</p><p>"Cough!"</p><p>A chorus of coughs arose as people covered their mouths and noses, closing their eyes, waiting for the dust storm to pass.</p><p>"Wah!"</p><p>A child's cry suddenly pierced the air, followed by a choked gasp, then more wailing after the wind subsided.</p><p>The child's cries, like those of the people around, were weak and listless.</p><p>Beside the child, a woman, her face covered in dust, obscuring her features, held the child's wrist.</p><p>The child was only three or four years old, but the woman was too weak to carry it.</p><p>Luckily, the mother was short, so the child could still touch the ground, but still, so young, dragged along, stumbling, leaving broken lines in the dust.</p><p>The mother's expression was as vacant as the others.  When the dust storm hit, she only lowered her head slightly, but her grip on the child's wrist was like iron.</p><p>Alarmed by the child's cries, the mother's dull eyes moved slightly, glancing at the child blankly, instinctively reaching out to wipe the child's eyes with the inside of her sleeve.</p><p>A child's eyes were filled with sand, the more his mother rubbed them, the more they hurt.  A gentle blowing would have helped, but she seemed to have forgotten, stubbornly scrubbing. The child cried louder and louder.</p><p>Someone nearby noticed.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>An old woman patted the mother, kindly offering help. The mother, suddenly frantic, shoved the old woman away, clutching her child and crying out in terror, "My child! Don't take my child…"</p><p>The scene was heartbreaking, but the crowd only stirred slightly. Who had the energy for sympathy anymore?</p><p>Not far away, another family trudged along – a thin man and woman with three children, each parent leading one, taking turns carrying the youngest.  For a family to remain intact this far into the exodus was remarkable, but each mouth to feed was a burden.</p><p>As they passed the mother and child, the man glanced at them.  The child's tear-streaked face triggered a memory: the enticing smell of meat from a pot simmering by the roadside the previous evening.  But with the devastating drought, even the animals were dying.</p><p>His gaze fixed on the child's face, the scent seeming to return, his throat working. He unconsciously slowed, his eyes taking on a strange, unsettling gleam. The child, sensing something, clung tighter to its mother.</p><p>His wife and children were oblivious, continuing their journey.  He felt a tug on his arm, turning to see his own child, those same unsettling eyes staring back.  Their clothes were stuffed with grass, deliberately caked in mud, obscuring their gender.  They were all girls. If they hadn't been with their clan, they would have been targeted long ago.</p><p>A recent encounter with bandits had separated them from their clan.  Their supplies were gone, no clan support, and they were starving. How could he feed them?</p><p>They couldn't all survive. It was impossible...</p><p>The thought echoed in his mind. His throat bobbed again. He couldn't bring himself to harm others, nor his own children, yet a terrible idea festered. He stopped. His wife and daughters looked at him questioningly.</p><p>Husband and wife understood each other instantly.  His wife saw it in his eyes – disbelief, then profound fear.</p><p>"Slap!"</p><p>She struck him, a weak blow, yet it cried out, "You're mad! They're your own flesh and blood!"</p><p>The man fell as if struck by lightning.</p><p>"Papa! Papa!"</p><p>His terrified daughters rushed to help him, forgetting their parents' instructions to remain silent.  Fortunately, few noticed.  All eyes were on the father.  Watching him struggle to his feet, the hope on some faces shifted to disappointment.</p><p>He covered his face, unable to meet his daughters' or his wife's gaze. Then, a sudden "thud." Another person fell – an old man, with a thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy, possibly his grandson. The old man had been frail, his trembling gait drawing attention for days. Finally, he'd collapsed.</p><p>"Grandpa! Grandpa!"</p><p>The boy tried to lift him, but the old man's head drooped lower, his eyes closed, his breathing shallow.  Suddenly, the boy saw shadows fall over his grandfather, and looked up to find a circle of people had gathered, their eyes like wolves.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>The boy cried, clinging to his grandfather, pleading, "No! Don't eat Grandpa! He's just asleep! He's not dead! He's not dead!"</p><p>As he begged, people seized the boy, one grabbing his shoulders, another his legs, pulling him back.  When he refused to let go of his grandfather, they knelt and pried open his fingers, one by one, the sound of cracking bones echoing.</p><p>A few people started it. The boy's pleas only attracted more. Most onlookers lacked the courage, some still wary of the recent plague that had weakened the old man. But the hunger was too intense for many.</p><p>…</p><p>"This is what chaos looks like," Qin Sang said. Compared to this, the suffering described by those on the Fuchun River was nothing.</p><p>He took Xiao Wu's hand and walked down the mountain.</p><p>A cooking pot was quickly set up beside the dirt road, and a fire was lit.</p><p>Someone held the boy down, while others, realizing there wasn't enough water, remembered a spring further back and went to fetch water in their containers.</p><p>Several people awkwardly moved the old man to the edge of the pot, intending to undress him.</p><p>As they bustled about, someone suddenly said, "He's just ill and weak, not yet passed.  May I examine him?"</p><p>Everyone looked up at the unexpected visitor. Three people stood up to block the way, glaring fiercely at Qin Sang.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang's attire, their courage immediately faltered.</p><p>In these times, only spirits could offer hope.  No one dared to disrespect a Daoist priest, especially one as dignified as Qin Sang.</p><p>The frenzy in their eyes subsided somewhat, and they hesitantly made way.</p><p>Qin Sang went to the old man, touched his forehead, took out a small, dark pill the size of a green pea, and put it in the old man's mouth.</p><p>Everyone on the dirt road stopped, their gazes fixed on the old man.</p><p>"Grandpa!"</p><p>The person holding the boy released him. The boy, freed at last, rushed over, crying.</p><p>After swallowing the dark pill, the old man's eyelids fluttered. His barely perceptible breath became more noticeable.</p><p>A faint blush even appeared on his withered, leathery face.</p><p>It seemed that not only had his illness improved, but his blood circulation had also recovered.</p><p>Instantly, everyone's eyes widened. The boy's face lit up with joy; he wiped away his tears and carefully helped the old man sit up.</p><p>'Cough! Cough!'</p><p>The old man coughed violently, caught his breath, and slowly opened his eyes, seeing his grandson.</p><p>"Huanlang…"</p><p>He reached out to touch his grandson's face, opened his mouth to speak, but suddenly felt something was wrong.</p><p>The knife-like pain in his throat was gone, his hunger vanished, his head clear.  With a slight effort, he lifted his arm.</p><p>It was as if he had just eaten a full meal, full of boundless energy.</p><p>The old man pushed himself up from the ground and stood, even bouncing twice. He felt no weakness, as if dreaming.</p><p>Everyone stared in disbelief.</p><p>"Miracle medicine!"</p><p>"A god!"</p><p>"Bow down to the god!"</p><p>They went wild, rushing from the dirt road, falling to their knees before Qin Sang, prostrating themselves.</p><p>"A god has saved us!"</p><p>"God, save us!"</p><p>"Save us!"</p><p>…</p><p>They cried out with all their might.</p><p>The old man, understanding what had happened, knelt with his grandson, repeatedly kowtowing.</p><p>"God bless! God bless!"</p><p>Already weak, several people fainted from the excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, looking at the surging crowd. "I have many more of these pills. There's no need to crowd."</p><p>He glanced at the nearby pot, frowned, kicked it over, and pointed at the crowd. "Set up more pots, those who have the strength, fetch water and firewood.  The more the better.  We'll melt the pills and everyone will have some. Form a line."</p><p>The people obeyed Qin Sang implicitly.  Rows of cooking pots were quickly set up, and firewood and water were continuously supplied.</p><p>Qin Sang ruffled Xiao Wu's hair.  "Xiao Wu, you tend the fires."</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded and went to stoke the fires. He didn't use any supernatural abilities, but he worked efficiently.</p><p>Seeing a young girl tending several pots, people felt compassion, and more importantly, worried she might ruin the divine pills, preventing them from receiving the medicinal water.</p><p>But it was the god's order, so no one dared to speak, watching Xiao Wu silently.</p><p>Word spread through the refugees. People from the front and rear converged, forming a long queue in front of the stoves.</p><p>The family had acted quickly and secured a place at the front.</p><p>The wife watched Xiao Wu moving between the stoves, a glimmer of hope flashing in her eyes.</p><p>She suddenly shoved her three daughters forward, whispering, "Go help the little god."</p><p>Xiao Wu looked up, then down again.</p><p>The three girls approached hesitantly. Seeing that Xiao Wu said nothing and Qin Sang didn't shoo them away, they timidly picked up some firewood and carefully handed it to Xiao Wu.</p><p>Xiao Wu took it and added it to the fire.</p><p>Emboldened, the three girls helped with the work.</p><p></p>
