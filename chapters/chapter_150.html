Chapter 143: Senior Sister Qingting

“Greetings, Senior Martial Brother Yu.”

Qin Sang thought about the sound transmission slips, stood up, and cupped his hands.

Yu Daiyue came over, smiling and saying, “Junior Martial Brother Qin, you are like an elusive dragon. These two years, I left many sound transmission slips and even personally went to Dragonback Temple to visit, but I could not see you. I would have missed you this time if I had not heard from the disciples at Jianmen Pass that you recently returned to the mountain.”

Qin Sang was shocked and suspicious. “Those sound transmission slips were left by Senior Martial Brother Yu?”

Yu Daiyue frowned and realized something was wrong. “Junior Martial Brother Qin, you do not know me?”

Qin Sang looked embarrassed and turned to look at Senior Martial Brother Wen.

Senior Martial Brother Wen had long understood, shook his head with a smile, and pointed at Yu Daiyue. “Junior Martial Brother Yu, I told you to come preach more in Daomen Peak, but you refused due to earning less spirit stones. Junior Martial Brother Qin may not know you. He joined the sect at the ninth layer of the Qi Refining and has been cultivating in the Underground Cave. He only returns to the mountain when some martial brothers preach in Daomen Peak. If I were not in charge of Daomen Peak, I would not have seen him. It was even worse after he broke through to the Foundation Establishment five years ago. He has been cultivating in the cave for five years and has not returned to the sect. The misty cloud tea I left for him has almost gone stale.”

“I see. Perhaps it is because of Senior Martial Brother Qin’s endurance and focus on cultivation that you were able to pass the trial of the Red Dust Gourd in the Qi Refining stage. With such a mindset, Senior Martial Brother Qin has a limitless future!”

Yu Daiyue respectfully cupped his hands at Qin Sang, thinking about how he had left his name on the sound transmission slips previously. “It does not matter if you did not know me before. It is not too late to get to know me now. You already know my name, Junior Martial Brother Qin. I came this time because of the matter I mentioned in the sound transmission slips. May I invite you to my cave for some tea? I can also fulfill my duties as the host.”

Since he had directly approached him, and they were from the same sect, it would not be good to reject him face to face.

Qin Sang did not refuse directly, bid farewell to Senior Martial Brother Wen, and followed Yu Daiyue to his cave.

On the way, Qin Sang recalled the sound transmission slips left by Yu Daiyue. The contents were similar, inviting him to explore an ancient cultivator’s ruin in the Yun滄 Great Marsh. It had been two years. Had they not set off yet?

He wondered why Senior Martial Brother Yu had chosen him and why he was so persistent.

Although Yu Daiyue was also in the early stage of the Foundation Establishment, he had passed the Precious Gourd Illusion Realm by himself and seemed to have many connections. His strength should not be underestimated.

If even this person had to invite helpers and prepare for so long, not daring to make a move immediately, then the ancient cultivator’s ruin must be extraordinary.

Qin Sang believed he had some life-saving methods, but his cultivation was much lower than those veteran Foundation Establishment cultivators. If he encountered danger in the ancient cultivator’s ruin, he would be in the most danger.

Furthermore, even if he found any treasures in the ancient cultivator’s ruin, he might not get any.

His current mission was clear. Five years was already quite long. It was the right path to start cultivating after engraving the first killing talisman as soon as possible. Other than that, everything else was secondary.

Having made up his mind to reject Yu Daiyue, Qin Sang relaxed and observed Yu Daiyue’s cave.

Yu Daiyue’s cave was on an inconspicuous peak in the sect, but it was very close to Mount Shaohua. One could vaguely see the archway on Mount Shaohua from his cave.

There was no spiritual spring in the cave, and although it was not as good as the White Cat’s cave, it was not bad compared to the spiritual spring caves outside, showing how amazing the spiritual veins under Mount Shaohua were.

“My cave is crude. I apologize to Junior Martial Brother Qin for making him laugh.”

Yu Daiyue opened the cave and led Qin Sang inside.

Qin Sang’s cave was as simple as a mountain cave, while Yu Daiyue’s cave was much more elegant, with decent tables and chairs, incense tables, screens, and paintings.

Yu Daiyue took out fragrant tea and brewed it. They chatted for a while before Yu Daiyue got to the main topic.

“What are Junior Martial Brother Qin’s thoughts on the matter I mentioned in the sound transmission slips?”

Qin Sang put down his teacup and asked with doubt, “Senior Martial Brother Yu, I am not belittling myself, but you were there during the Red Dust Gourd Illusion Realm. You must know that my foundation was damaged and that my strength is far inferior to yours. There are many Foundation Establishment cultivators in Mount Shaohua, and each of them is much stronger than me. May I know why you chose me?”

“I invited you because you have something unique about you.”

Yu Daiyue pointed at his own mind. “You were able to pass the trial of the Red Dust Gourd. What I value is your mindset.”

Junior Brother Qin didn't know that there was a gust of wind barrier outside the ancient remains, and there was a magic sound that impacted one's spirit. This magic sound was very strange, as if it rang directly in one's sea of consciousness, impacting Yuan Shen. Ordinary magic devices would not work on it. That's why those who were not firm in spirit would definitely not be able to pass through this barrier."

Is there such a strange barrier?

Qin Sang secretly thought that it was no wonder he was asked to help. "I remember that Brothers Gong, Zhao, and others were there that day. I wonder why Brother Yu didn't ask them? There are also other fellow disciples, and there are many more who have not participated in the test of the Red Gourd Illusion."

"I have already asked all of them."

Yu Daiyue gave a wry smile. "After that gust of wind barrier outside the ancient remains, there is another formation restriction, which is extremely strong and cannot be broken by one person. I have contacted not only you, Junior Brother Qin, but also other fellow disciples. I have contacted Sister-apprentice Qingting as well. Zhang, the junior brother, has been summoned by the sect and has gone to the ancient immortal battlefield. Brother Gong claimed that he is old and has given up on seeking the Immortal Path, so he resolutely rejected my invitation. Brother Zhao has retired and become a wealthy landlord in his hometown, so I can't contact him. There are many Foundation Establishment cultivators in our sect, but most of them are like you, Junior Brother Qin, who are elusive. I don't know much about the character of those who are not familiar with me. I have already invited Wu Yuesheng, but the number of people is still not enough."

"Is Sister-apprentice Qingting going too?"

Qin Sang's expression changed when he heard this name. He knew this person.

When he was in the Qi Refinement period, he liked to listen to the teachings of several uncles on Dao Men Peak, and she was one of them, but she used to be called Uncle-master Qingting.

Although Sister-apprentice Qingting was ordinary-looking, she was easy-going and approachable, and she was very popular.

It was said that Sister-apprentice Qingting was also a sad person. She had a dual cultivation partner who died unexpectedly.

However, which Foundation Establishment cultivator did not have a story?

Yu Daiyue nodded and said, "I won't hide it from you, Junior Brother Qin. I bought the clue to the ancient remains from the auction at Tianhen Pavilion in Wen Yuebaofang. Sister-apprentice Qingting was also there. We both saw that there was something fishy about this clue, so we each paid half of the spirit stones and worked together to enter the Great Cloud Swamp to investigate for more than a year before we could determine its location. I didn't expect the restriction outside the remains to be so difficult to deal with, so I had to come back and find a way. Now that Sister-apprentice Qingting is preparing to break the formation, the task of finding people has fallen on my shoulders."
