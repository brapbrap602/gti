<h1>Chapter 1355  Peach Blossoms Still Laugh in the Spring Wind</h1><p>Qin Sang received the urgent message.</p><p>After reading it, she gave a soft exclamation, her expression slightly surprised.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Jing Yu looked over curiously.</p><p>"Several days ago, Dongyang Bo passed the leadership of the sect to a disciple and left Mount Shaohua," Qin Sang concealed the letter, gazing towards Mount Shaohua, her eyes flickering.</p><p>A hint of joy flashed in her eyes, then gave way to alertness and contemplation.</p><p>She pondered the meaning behind Dongyang Bo's actions, wondering if there was a hidden conspiracy.</p><p>After the Blood Pool Battle, Dongyang Bo had been very 'obedient'.</p><p>Qin Sang had deliberately created opportunities for him on the battlefield, but Dongyang Bo never took the bait.</p><p>Dongyang Bo certainly knew the origin of the puppet in Qin Sang's possession, yet in all these years, there had been no rumors in the cultivation world related to the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had painstakingly plotted against Gongliang Yu, only for Qin Sang to benefit in the end.  He himself was also injured by Qin Sang, and seemed to have truly resigned himself to his fate.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart found peace regarding her hatred, and she no longer focused solely on revenge.</p><p>Both sides had lived in peace.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Mount Shaohua changed hands silently.</p><p>"Someone on Mount Shaohua has broken through to Nascent Soul. Who is it?"</p><p>Jing Yu knew of Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo's feud, and had thoroughly investigated Mount Shaohua's details.  She enumerated Dongyang Bo's several famous disciples, "Legend says that the disciple with the best talent on Mount Shaohua, and the one most favored by Dongyang Bo, is a disciple named Qiu Mubai. He is already in the late Golden Core stage, but he is still some distance from the Nascent Soul bottleneck.  Among those at the peak of the Golden Core stage, the one with the highest chance of forming a Nascent Soul should be Che Yutao, right?"</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang slowly shook her head.</p><p>"Neither! Che Yutao failed to break through the Nascent Soul bottleneck and perished in his cave half a year ago. Qiu Mubai also did not form a Nascent Soul, and Dongyang Bo took him away when he left."</p><p>Jing Yu was startled, "If not these two favored disciples, did Mount Shaohua produce another extraordinary genius?"</p><p>"It's not some genius, and no one on Mount Shaohua formed a Nascent Soul. The one who succeeded Dongyang Bo is — Mu Yifeng!"</p><p>Qin Sang tapped the urgent message in her hand, her tone complex.</p><p>After returning to Beichen Realm, Qin Sang had always wanted to meet Mu Yifeng.</p><p>She now had the ability to repay Mu Yifeng.</p><p>However, for decades, even during the most critical moments of the Three Realms War, Mu Yifeng had always remained on Mount Shaohua in seclusion, never stepping out of the sect once.</p><p>Considering Dongyang Bo, Qin Sang dared not act rashly, only sending people to infiltrate the market outside Mount Shaohua, constantly observing, waiting for Mu Yifeng to emerge from seclusion.</p><p>Yet, she unexpectedly received this news.</p><p>Mu Yifeng had become the leader of a sect!</p><p>Dongyang Bo passing the leadership to Mu Yifeng, instead of his favored disciple Qiu Mubai, was it because he acknowledged Mu Yifeng's cultivation and talent to be stronger than Qiu Mubai's, or was there another deeper meaning?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't naive enough to believe this was a coincidence.</p><p>She would definitely give her full support to Mu Yifeng's leadership of Mount Shaohua.</p><p>With her position in the Beichen Alliance, she could guarantee that for the next few hundred years, at least, no one would dare to trouble Mount Shaohua.</p><p>It would be different if it were Qiu Mubai.</p><p>She wouldn't hold a grudge against Qiu Mubai, but she wouldn't offer him any help either.</p><p>She wouldn't need to take action herself; a mere hint, or a slight display of attitude, would be enough to cause Mount Shaohua, having lost Dongyang Bo, to be ostracized by all sides.</p><p>If Dongyang Bo had precisely calculated this, and that was why he passed Mount Shaohua on to Mu Yifeng…</p><p>He likely knew long ago that Mu Yifeng had deliberately let her go!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank slightly.</p><p>"It's him?"</p><p>Jing Yu was also quite surprised.  Understanding the implications, she clicked her tongue twice, "Dongyang Bo is truly cunning! Mu Yifeng disobeyed his master's orders and let you go, yet Dongyang Bo could endure it for hundreds of years, and even promoted him to sect leader. It's truly unexpected!"</p><p>"Not necessarily! Back then, Mu Yifeng wasn't a Golden Core cultivator, so he wasn't of much value. Dongyang Bo wasn't that magnanimous either."</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head.</p><p>She recalled the information she had previously investigated: Mu Yifeng's cave was on Jingyue Peak.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's willingness to forgive Mu Yifeng likely had something to do with Chen Yan.</p><p>At that time, the deed was done.</p><p>Furthermore, Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan had not completely fallen out, and had reached some kind of agreement.</p><p>If Chen Yan had interceded for Mu Yifeng, given Dongyang Bo's profound scheming, it wouldn't be unimaginable for him to swallow his pride.</p><p>However, Qin Sang hadn't expected that Dongyang Bo would use Mu Yifeng as a pawn, putting her in a difficult position.</p><p>"Where did Dongyang Bo go?"</p><p>Jing Yu asked again.</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head, "Mu Yifeng doesn't know either, but before leaving, Dongyang Bo personally told Mu Yifeng that this time, he probably wouldn't have the chance to return!"</p><p>Jing Yu mused, "I remember Fellow Daoist Qingjun once mentioned that Dongyang Bo's cultivation speed was abnormal…"</p><p>After a breakthrough, his progress stagnated for over a hundred years.  There's suspicion that he used a risky, forbidden technique to force the breakthrough. His tribulation is still a century away, and even if he failed to overcome it, he could still push Qiu Mubai to at least the peak of the Golden Core stage. His sudden departure suggests an imminent crisis related to that technique.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed her eyes.</p><p>Jing Yu's guess was likely close to the truth.</p><p>Dongyang Bo valued his sect's legacy greatly, and his presence ensured no one could suppress Mount Shaohua. His silent departure must have a reason.</p><p>The entire Northern Star Territory is under the control of the Northern Star Alliance.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts quickened, exchanging a glance with Jing Yu.</p><p>"The Three Seas Regions!"</p><p>Qin Sang paced back and forth. "Chen Yan has a mysterious master. Dongyang Bo's breakthrough secret technique likely came from Chen Yan, a condition for their renewed collaboration. If Dongyang Bo wants to resolve the hidden danger, he can only ask Chen Yan for help! His cultivation allows a high chance of crossing the storm belt alone. But why risk taking Qiu Mubai with him?"</p><p>Jing Yu smiled, "Perhaps he's afraid you'll take your anger out on his favorite disciple."</p><p>"He underestimates me."</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly.</p><p>Every wrong has its perpetrator, every debt its debtor.</p><p>All the hatred lies solely between her and Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Her experiences at Mount Shaohua are an indelible part of her cultivation journey; she wouldn't unreasonably blame an innocent person.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang turned to the white cat, "Go fetch Mu Yifeng to Peach Blossom Valley... no, I'll go see him myself!"</p><p>Jing Yu rose, and together they flew towards the valley exit.</p><p>The Qingyang Temple gate is the former site of the Yuanshen Gate.</p><p>Before leaving, Qing Junlin entrusted the Yuanshen Gate to Qin Sang, but she didn't want to absorb so many disciples, fearing it would become unwieldy. She selected a lesser quality spirit vein in the south foothills of the Skywalk Plateau and relocated the Yuanshen Gate there.</p><p>The Northern Star Alliance offered no objection, and the Yuanshen Gate disciples dared not defy Qin Sang's decision.</p><p>The white cat hopped happily behind them.</p><p>At the entrance to Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>The mist parted, revealing a human and two demonic beasts flying out of Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>It was sunset again.</p><p>The setting sun streamed in.</p><p>As Qin Sang flew out, a golden light enveloped her.  She paused, sensing something, and turned to look back at Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Peach blossoms bloomed, dyeing the orchard.</p><p>The scenery was breathtaking.</p><p>"Ten years..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly.</p><p>She remembered.</p><p>Then, the faces and the peach blossoms were a vibrant contrast.</p><p>Now, the peach blossoms still smile in the spring breeze.</p>
