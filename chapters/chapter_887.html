<h1>Chapter 879: A Familiar Scene</h1><p>Descending from the Cloud Bridge, the avatar felt a sudden lightness as a flying sword caught him, pulling him from the illusionary realm.</p><p>Most of the others had already fallen, now separated into two groups on either side of the dock. Some were meditating, while others stood, their expressions varied.</p><p>The left side held a much smaller group, only about a dozen, all radiating an air of triumph. This included the young man who had fallen first, his previous dejection replaced with elation.</p><p>In contrast, the larger group on the right was shrouded in gloom.</p><p>The avatar instantly understood: the cultivators on the left were the ones chosen by the Smoke and Mist Pavilion.</p><p>He glanced around.</p><p>Sure enough, the boy with the three spiritual roots, who had been assessed earlier, was among them.</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, the avatar felt a pull as the sword cultivator gestured to the left. Amidst envious stares, he was carried by the flying sword to the left side of the dock.</p><p>A joyful expression spread across the avatar's face. Without pausing to recover his spiritual energy, he straightened his robes and bowed, saying, "Thank you, Senior, for this opportunity!"</p><p>"You're quite clever!"</p><p>The sword cultivator retracted his sword with a chuckle.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator scrutinized the avatar, admiration evident in his gaze. "Indeed, you dared to be the first and possess unwavering resolve.  Only when your spiritual energy was nearly depleted did the Cloud Bridge affect your state of mind. Although your talent is somewhat lacking, your temperament is superior to all the others. No wonder you were able to smoothly break through the three bottlenecks. In the future, you might achieve great things."</p><p>The sword cultivator's laughter subsided, and he spoke seriously, "You have the makings of a fine swordsman.  Are you interested in learning swordsmanship at our Flying Rainbow Hall?"</p><p>"Junior Brother Ding!"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator shot him a reproving glance. "These disciples still need to be reviewed by the Pavilion Master, who will assign them personally. The Pavilion Master will consider the Pavilion's needs. As disciples, we shouldn't overstep our bounds."</p><p>The sword cultivator chuckled, unfazed by his senior brother's reprimand. "When the Pavilion Master assigns them, doesn't he also consider their talents and wishes? This young man's temperament requires no further refinement.  Besides our Flying Rainbow Hall, where else would be suitable for him?  Is he supposed to go stoke fires at the Cauldron Hall? I'm just offering some guidance to prevent him from going astray."</p><p>The fourth person beside them suddenly interjected, "With such a stable temperament, he would also be well-suited to drawing talismans in our Snow Shadow Hall."</p><p>He then lowered his head, avoiding the sword cultivator's glare.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator and the blue-robed man exchanged glances, shaking their heads in resignation.</p><p>The disciples hadn't even been formally accepted, and the infighting had already begun.</p><p>The avatar listened to their argument, amused and slightly exasperated.  His level of talent was unexpectedly causing a stir. Fortunately, he had 'fallen' in time, avoiding an overly impressive performance.</p><p>Five people remained on the Cloud Bridge, each with a cultivation level higher than the avatar's, exceeding the tenth level of Qi Refinement.</p><p>One of them, an elderly man with white hair, possessed the thirteenth level of Qi Refinement, the highest among them.</p><p>The four members of the Smoke and Mist Pavilion were discussing whether to accept the elder.</p><p>After a while, these individuals also descended, the elder's performance particularly remarkable. He had persevered until his spiritual energy was almost completely exhausted before falling.</p><p>Even at the last moment, battered by fierce winds and the bridge's mental manipulation, his body swayed like a willow in the wind, yet his mind retained a sliver of clarity, stubbornly resisting.</p><p>As the flying sword returned with the elder,</p><p>Silence fell over the dock.</p><p>The four from the Smoke and Mist Pavilion straightened, their playful demeanor gone.</p><p>The sword cultivator sighed almost imperceptibly, murmuring, "A pity he's too old, with no hope of Foundation Establishment."</p><p>The Snow Shadow Hall cultivator's eyes gleamed, as if he had found a treasure, instantly forgetting about the avatar.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please go and recover."</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator gestured to the left side of the dock.</p><p>The elder, also shrewd, understood he had been chosen. Though exhausted, he shakily rose and bowed in gratitude. "This old man is humbled!"</p><p>Tears streamed down his face.</p><p>No one mocked him.</p><p>The cultivators on the right side of the dock wore thoughtful expressions. Some, not waiting for the official announcement, cupped their hands towards the Pavilion members and departed on their flying swords.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists,"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator turned to those remaining on the right. "You have failed the Cloud Bridge trial today. Please return."</p><p>Despite being prepared, some still wept openly.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator then addressed the other group. "Although you have passed the Cloud Bridge trial, you are not yet official disciples of the Smoke and Mist Pavilion. You must still be reviewed by the Pavilion Master. Board the boat for now."</p><p>With that, he tossed out a palm-sized bamboo boat.</p><p>The boat expanded in the wind, transforming into a large vessel. The chosen cultivators filed aboard, and the boat sliced through the waves, speeding towards the island at the center of the lake.</p><p>The Cloud Bridge had vanished, the mist dissipating without a trace.</p><p>Soon, the boat brought them closer to the island, then sailed unhesitatingly into the sea of fog.</p><p>Billowing mist parted like giant waves on either side.</p><p>Inside, the surroundings were a blinding white, easy to get lost in.</p><p>The cultivators wore expressions of awe. The worldly avatar discerned that the sea of fog wasn't a particularly powerful spiritual formation, just a common illusion array.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly had previously spied on the Smoke and Mist Pavilion, revealing that the center of the fog held not just one island, but likely a sizeable area concealed by the mist.</p><p>With the Smoke and Mist Pavilion's strength, they likely couldn't maintain such a large, high-level formation. The true protective formation must lie within.</p><p>Without any apparent action from the middle-aged cultivator, the bamboo boat navigated the fog for a time, then suddenly emerged into clear space.</p><p>Vast, misty waters stretched out before them.</p><p>Several verdant peaks rose from the lake, no less imposing than the mountains outside.</p><p>Jade bridges connected these peaks, figures visible on some of them.  Vines hung from others, cascading down in varying lengths, some reaching the water's surface.</p><p>The vines swayed in the gentle breeze, like natural curtains, creating a vibrant scene.</p><p>A fairyland-like vista unfolded, captivating the impoverished rogue cultivators.</p><p>A dazed expression crossed the avatar's face.</p><p>This scene of mountains in water, and people among the mountains, stirred a hidden memory.</p><p>Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Enemies and friends.</p><p>While not entirely pleasant, those years held memories of several transformations he underwent there.</p><p>Decades had passed in a flash. Were those people still there?</p><p>"The peaks ahead are the location of our Smoke and Mist Pavilion.  This will be where you cultivate from now on..."</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's voice startled the others. He lightly tapped his foot, and the bamboo boat rose from the water, shooting towards one of the green peaks.</p><p>As they neared the peak, the cultivator flashed a token at his waist and ascended without hindrance, landing on a stone platform halfway up the mountain, where he disembarked the group.</p><p>A stone path led from the platform straight to the summit.  Amidst the trees, several grand halls could be glimpsed.</p><p>"Come, follow me to see the Pavilion Master!"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator led them up the steps.</p>
