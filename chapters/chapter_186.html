<h1>Chapter 179: The Black Market</h1><p>The so-called Essence Spring Item is the object that a Spring of Essence rests on in its birth.</p><p>Irrigated by the Spring of Essence day and night, these objects would also transform from mortal things, existing as supporting items of the Spring of Essence in the world.</p><p>If a Spring of Essence is born on a tree root, this root will transform into an Essence Spring Item; if it is born on a rock, this rock will become the Essence Spring Item.</p><p>Of course, there are also springs of essence born in the void, without an Essence Spring Item.</p><p>If a Spring of Essence is destroyed or dried up due to some reasons, the Essence Spring Item might remain.</p><p>Although Springs of Essence are rare, countless have been discovered over the years, and there are indeed some dried-up Essence Spring Items circulating in the immortal cultivation world.</p><p>These dried-up Essence Spring Items can neither be used to refine magical artifacts nor to refine pills, but because of their peculiar formation reasons, they are regarded as unusual objects, and many are willing to collect them.</p><p>The author of the Secret Transmission Dragon Acupoint Commentary speculated that this kind of Essence Spring Item could be used to ripen a Spring of Essence. Unfortunately, he collected an Essence Spring Item but did not find an unformed Spring of Essence.</p><p>It is only because the birth of a Spring of Essence is difficult, but it does not take a long time from birth to maturity. Cultivators can wait, and from the moment the Spring of Essence is born, the spiritual power of the cave abode will become extremely strong, enough to support the cultivator's cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang's situation is also a special case. The Nascent Soul and Sword Nurturing Scripture requires frequent fierce combat and cultivation. The妖兽 in the Misty Cloud Great Marsh are all hidden at the bottom of the water. Searching for 妖兽 every time will inevitably delay a long time. If he asks a fellow disciple for advice, he will be very restrained during the fight, so the effect is almost non-existent.</p><p>Apart from the ancient immortal battlefield, it is difficult for other places to meet this condition.</p><p>...</p><p>Wen Yuefang, Tian Hen Tower.</p><p>Tian Hen Tower is a shop with great fame among the four major trading centers near Shao Hua Mountain. It is supported by the Yu family, the most influential immortal cultivation family in Wen Yuefang. Of course, the Yu family's rise has an unclear relationship with Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>Among them, the most famous is Tian Hen Tower's monthly auction, where there are countless magical treasures and immortal cultivators gather. However, Qin Sang did not come for the auction this time.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang walked into the Tian Hen Tower, a pretty girl with a good appearance came up to greet him, and she was actually a cultivator. However, she only had the cultivation level of the third stage Qi Refining Realm.</p><p>"Little Huan has met Young Master, I wonder what Young Master needs? Do you want to buy something or sell a treasure?"</p><p>Before the last words were finished, a gray-robed old man hurried out from the depths of the hall. The ash-robed old man apologized to Qin Sang and secretly waved his hand to make Little Huan go down. "Senior, please forgive me, the little girl has no insight, and the things in the hall are all mundane things that cannot catch your attention. If Senior needs anything, please follow this junior to the quiet room upstairs for a detailed discussion."</p><p>Qin Sang did not hide his cultivation level, the gray-robed old man is in the 13th stage of the Qi Refining Realm, so he could naturally see that Qin Sang was not simple.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, Tian Hen Tower's first floor was filled with display cabinets, some with jade slips spiritual materials, and some with pills and magical tools. Indeed, they were all of little value, so he nodded and said, "Please lead the way, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>The gray-robed old man moved sideways to lead the way and said with a smile, "My surname is Zhang, and I am honored to be a deacon of Tian Hen Tower."</p><p>Entering the quiet room, Qin Sang didn't want to waste time and went straight to the point, "Steward Zhang, I need two spiritual refining materials, which are Ghost Eagle Feathers and Moonlight Cypress Core. Among them, it is best if the Ghost Eagle Feathers are freshly plucked, not more than three years old; and the Moonlight Cypress Core's age must be above five hundred years. I wonder if your store has any for sale?"</p><p>Seeing this, Steward Zhang also gave up the idea of getting close and said, "Please wait a moment, Senior?"</p><p>Having finished speaking, Steward Zhang held a jade pendant in his hand, and his lips were moving slightly as if he was saying something. A moment later, Steward Zhang nodded slightly and said, "Reporting to Senior, our store does have these two spiritual materials. Among them, the Moonlight Cypress Core is six hundred years old and can meet Senior's requirements. However, we do not have fresh Ghost Eagle Feathers. We only have some old feathers that are more than ten years old. I wonder if it can meet Senior's requirements?"</p><p>Qin Sang secretly believed that refining a zombie required extracting the Ghost Eagle Feathers' Yin Fire. He was not familiar with the Heavenly Yin Corpse Technique in his first refining, and the Yin Fire's on the old Ghost Eagle Feathers would be greatly reduced. I'm afraid not, but it's better than nothing, so he bought it first.</p><p>Thinking about this, Qin Sang nodded and said, "Please ask Steward Zhang to send someone with the items. In addition, please help me check if there are any dried-up Essence Spring Items available in your store?"</p><p>...</p><p>Leaving Tian Hen Tower, Qin Sang's brows were slightly frowned. The dried-up Essence Spring Item was even harder to find than he had imagined. Steward Zhang contacted the branches of the other three trading centers, but there was no news.</p><p>Qin Sang had no choice but to leave some Spirit Stone and ask Tian Hen Tower to help pay attention.</p><p>However, Deacon Zhang told Qin Sang that he had been a deacon in Skymark Tower for decades and had never seen something of this sort.</p><p>"I can't do anything, so I can only leave it to fate. If I really can't find it, I'll act according to the original plan." Qin Sang sighed to himself dejectedly and quickened his pace toward Shopkeeper Wu's shop.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu happened to be in the shop. As the two talked idly, Shopkeeper Wu laughed when he heard about Qin Sang's troubles. "Fellow Daoist Qin, it's actually normal to fail to buy Spinetail feathers in Skymark Tower. First, the Spinetails are vicious, evil monsters that live in the deepest area of Skybreak Mountain, where the Yin energy is the strongest. That area is a devil cultivator's territory. Second, the Spinetail feather is a crest feather on the Spinetail's head that carries a strange, cold fire. It's a rare material for refining equipment. However, this cold fire isn't very useful to righteous cultivators, and can even damage magic tools. Instead, the old feathers that have burned away the cold fire are more popular. My master left some channels for collecting materials to me. If Fellow Daoist Qin needs, I can help you with some, but Fellow Daoist Qin needs it urgently, so the price is high."</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed when he heard this, "Then I must thank Fellow Daoist Wu. As long as I can buy them, the price is easy to discuss. Fellow Daoist Qin will thank you heavily then."</p><p>Qin Sang finally decided to tell Shopkeeper Wu that he needed the things that had absorbed the spirit spring.</p><p>"The things that Fellow Daoist Qin needs are hard to find, even in Skymark Tower. It will be hard to find it in other regular shops. However, besides those, there are actually two more channels that Poor Dao knows..."</p><p>Wu Yuesheng cautiously locked the store door and moved closer. He said softly, "One of them is the black market."</p><p>"The black market?"</p><p>Qin Sang had heard about the black market before. It was rumored that there would often be many boutiques there and that they were even better than those things from Skymark Tower's auction. However, many of things' origins were suspicious. In other words, the black market was a place for getting rid of stolen goods.</p><p>Among Wu Yuesheng's magic tools, there were a few that Qin Sang couldn't use, but he couldn't sell them in Askmoon Market. Otherwise, it would be the same as ignoring the Shyinghua Mountain. He could only sell them after entering the ancient immortal battlefield.</p><p>The Baiyun Mountain people's magic tools were all very normal. It was fine to sell them but the quality was not high. If he sold them to the black market, they would look down on them.</p><p>Therefore, on one hand, Qin Sang didn't have any suspicious things that needed to be sold, and on the other hand, he focused on training and didn't need anything urgently. This caused him not to seek it out on purpose.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu was an old-timer in Askmoon Market, so it was normal that he would know about the black market.</p><p>However, the things that had absorbed the spirit springs weren't very valuable, and the black market might not have any.</p>
