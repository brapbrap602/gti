<h1>Chapter 1649: The Five-Colored Crown</h1><p>Chapter 1649: The Five-Colored Crown</p><p>“Hiss hiss…”</p><p>The venomous insects within the black light emitted increasingly shrill cries.  A faint crimson hue emerged from within the black glow.  As the blood-red color intensified, the insects, instead of targeting the mountain, turned fiercely on their master, hissing and seemingly struggling to break free, threatening to turn on him.</p><p>The Poison King furrowed his brow, inserting two fingers into the black light.  A searing pain shot through him, his already pale face flushing an unnatural crimson, and a muffled groan escaped his throat.</p><p>Employing some unknown secret technique, the Poison King gradually subdued the insects’ ferocity, their cries becoming less shrill. He took a deep breath, but his breathing remained ragged and uneven, failing to settle for a long time.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, observing the Poison King's actions, sighed, “A fearsome insect indeed!”</p><p>The Poison King silently channeled his inner energy, calming the turbulent blood surging within him, though his voice sounded somewhat weak,  “It's not entirely its fault. This technique greatly amplifies the residual aggression inherent in its nature.”</p><p>“This technique should be used with caution,” Master Huaiyin warned.</p><p>While triggering the insects' aggression is simple, subduing it is far more difficult. Repeated use of the same technique in a short period would inevitably lead to escalating risks, eventually becoming uncontrollable.  The Poison King's efforts to calm the insects were noticeably more strenuous than before.</p><p>“Thank you for your warning, Master. I know the risks. If this technique didn't have such significant drawbacks and couldn't be sustained indefinitely, I wouldn't have let that scoundrel escape.  Fortunately, Heaven has granted us this chance; this time, he will not escape!”</p><p>The Poison King, with a flick of his sleeve, retracted the insects.  He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, gazing towards the mountaintop, his voice icy.</p><p>They waited before the Jade Gate.  Zhu Wu Dao and the others were still working. The four of them launched a concerted attack on the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>Suspended in mid-air, seemingly unsupported, the Jade Pavilion swayed under the assault, appearing as though it might be shattered at any moment, yet proving far more resilient than its appearance suggested.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao bore the brunt of the pressure. While attacking the pavilion, he also analyzed the protective enchantments and directed his companions. The strain on his mental energy was immense, yet he persevered, showing no signs of exhaustion.</p><p>This heightened Fan Lao Mo's apprehension.  After joining forces with Zhu Wu Dao, Fan Lao Mo had been silently observing this familiar yet unfamiliar junior brother.</p><p>They were of equal rank in the Tian Hao Tower, of similar age, and had frequently interacted and subtly competed since the Qi Refining stage, with Zhu Wu Dao always appearing inferior.  Once Zhu Wu Dao broke through to the late Yuan Ying stage and secured the position of Grand Elder, he believed their rivalry was finally settled.  But he had never expected Zhu Wu Dao to be concealing his true cultivation all along.</p><p>For years, he had been flawlessly deceptive in front of both Fan Lao Mo and the Sect Master!  The meticulous nature of this deception sent a chill down Fan Lao Mo's spine.</p><p>While attacking the Jade Pavilion, Fan Lao Mo pondered Zhu Wu Dao's motives, suspecting something was amiss, yet Zhu Wu Dao’s reasoning – the opportunity to achieve transcendence – was compelling enough to justify the risk.</p><p>Unable to pinpoint the problem, Fan Lao Mo was deep in thought when Mo Xing Dao’s warning cut through his reverie.</p><p>“Careful!”</p><p>A sharp cracking sound emanated from within the Jade Pavilion, a fissure suddenly appearing on the lintel, extending all the way to the second level.</p><p>Their attack had finally borne fruit!</p><p>But what followed was unexpected, even to Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>The first crack served as a signal.  A series of ‘crack-crack’ sounds echoed as countless fissures rapidly spread across the entire pavilion like a spiderweb.</p><p>“The formation is destabilizing!”</p><p>Su Zi Nan’s eyes swept across the scene, identifying the root cause. Their attack had triggered the problem, but the Di Shou Mountain grand formation, sealed for a long time, had undergone its own changes, culminating in the current explosive result that rapidly destroyed the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>This might not necessarily be a bad thing, as they intended to destroy the Pavilion anyway.</p><p>The four cultivators, of comparable cultivation base and lightning-fast reflexes, immediately ceased their attack and shifted to a defensive posture.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao, clad in golden armor, raised his golden decree, showering the area in golden light. Su Zi Nan raised his hand, deploying a dragon-sinew net, encircling himself.  Mo Xing Dao expelled his vital energy, creating a protective shield.  Fan Lao Mo transformed into a black mist, becoming nearly invisible.</p><p>Just as they completed their defenses, the Jade Pavilion, unable to withstand the pressure, exploded with a thunderous roar.  A violent shockwave, along with countless fragments, engulfed the four of them.</p><p>In an instant, starting from the Jade Pavilion, the entire jade staircase collapsed, like a shattered illusion, dissolving into the chaotic mist, a scene of celestial transformation!</p><p>The four vanished without a trace.</p><p>…</p><p>Within Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>An unknown location.</p><p>A luminous orb floated in the darkness, suspended silently.</p><p>The tranquility was shattered by the actions of Zhu Wu Dao and the others.  Ripples appeared on the orb's surface, with five-colored lights alternately illuminating it, pulsating rhythmically.</p><p>As the Jade Pavilion shattered, a brilliant orb of light illuminated the surroundings, its five-colored radiance revealing a faint image of a five-colored crown slowly rotating at its heart.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang was speeding through the void.</p><p>He had lost count of his attempts.</p><p>Connected to the Sky Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang focused his mind, diligently studying the void's restrictions.  His efforts were proving fruitful; he was uncovering fundamental patterns and delving into finer details.</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>A faint, weary sigh echoed through the darkness.</p><p>His solitary calculations were extremely taxing, but success would guarantee his arrival at his destination.</p><p>“I wonder if my clone has obtained the celestial pendant?”</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind just as he was about to make a breakthrough.</p><p>Suddenly, an unusual tremor rippled through the void.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  He had felt these tremors before, but they were minor. This one was far stronger.</p><p>“Did I cause this by forcing my way in?”</p><p>He mused.</p><p>His calculations only revealed the space within this Jade Pavilion; he couldn't perceive the entirety of the Emperor's Gift Mountain array, and thus didn't understand the meaning of the tremor.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's face changed.</p><p>The previous tremors were intermittent; this one was unrelenting, intensifying rapidly!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang activated the Ruyi Pearl.</p><p>A protective energy shield enveloped him, reinforced by a layer of demonic fire.</p><p>He had barely finished when the void manifested an abnormality, freezing solid before shattering with a boom, the restrictions collapsing!</p><p>In that instant, vibrant multicolored light flooded in, banishing the darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang felt like he'd fallen into a kaleidoscope, surrounded by countless shattered mirrors.  These mirrors swirled, their reflections piecing together to form what appeared to be the interior of a hall.</p><p>This thought was immediately followed by a tremendous force, crushing his energy shield and sweeping him along.</p><p>After a flash of light and shifting images, he was flung away.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang struggled to regain his footing, finding himself in an unfamiliar great hall.</p><p>…</p><p>Before another Jade Pavilion…</p><p>Two disciples from the Jade Terrace Sect were using a Fire Phase Token to open the pavilion's door, about to enter, when the robed Taoist suddenly stopped, restraining the female disciple.</p><p>The female disciple was startled. Seeing her senior brother's grim and serious expression—she knew his temperament well, such a reaction only occurring in the face of grave danger—her heart trembled.  “Senior Brother, what is it…?”</p><p>The robed Taoist signaled for silence, standing before the door, his gaze fixed on the pavilion.</p><p>Upon seeing something, his expression changed dramatically. He cried out, pulling the female disciple's hand and retreating swiftly.</p><p>She almost stumbled.</p><p>Fortunately, they shared a deep understanding; the female disciple immediately used their sect's unique movement technique, watching the Jade Pavilion distance itself.</p><p>The pavilion's door remained open, the dark entrance seeming to conceal something terrifying.</p><p>Confused, the female disciple then saw the Jade Pavilion violently shake.</p><p>The robed Taoist, not pausing, hurried back down the jade steps, abandoning the Fire Phase Token, finally managing an explanation.  “Someone is trying to destroy the Jade Pavilion!”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>There was clearly nobody around the Pavilion!</p><p>The female disciple paused, then remembered her senior brother mentioning there were five tokens and therefore five pavilions, meaning others were on the mountain.</p><p>She had witnessed her senior brother opening the pavilion, and knew its incredible strength; they, as a pair of cultivators, certainly couldn't destroy it.</p><p>Even two powerful cultivators likely couldn't!</p><p>What were those powerful cultivators trying to accomplish by destroying the pavilions?</p><p>“They didn't go to the Celestial Palace?”</p><p>The female disciple exclaimed.</p><p>This was precisely what the robed Taoist found perplexing and concerning. No matter how good the Unseen Celestial Sect was, it couldn't compare to the opportunities within the Celestial Palace. Why would these powerful cultivators choose the lesser option?</p><p>No one could explain it.</p><p>Before they had retreated far, a muffled explosion echoed from the depths of the mist-sea, a surging wave emanating from the front, sweeping a crimson ring along with it, originating from the Jade Pavilion ahead.  Strangely, the ring contained not an impact force, but suction.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The ring approached.</p><p>The two disciples froze, feeling a tremendous pull towards an unknown destination.</p><p>“Junior Sister, be careful! Don’t be pulled in! The array has shifted; its second transformation has begun, altering the five elemental positions!”</p><p>The robed Taoist shouted, his robes billowing as he wielded his Crimson Fire Sword, its light forming rings to forcefully cut through the suction.</p><p>Hearing this, Kun Dao finally understood her senior brother's fear.  Countless powerful cultivators resided in the mountains, and being drawn amongst them would put them in extreme danger.</p><p>Kun Dao was frantic, immediately summoning her life-saving treasure and attacking relentlessly with the Crimson Fire Sword.</p><p>Fortunately, the White-robed Daoist had some understanding of the Di Shou Mountain formation and had withdrawn earlier. The suction force around them was much weaker than near the Jade Pavilion, allowing them to resist.</p><p>The suction felt like invisible shackles.</p><p>They struggled to break free, and after a strenuous effort, the suction vanished without warning.  The earth then shook violently. Before they could react, a tremendous force flung them away.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The two crashed into the mountain wall.</p><p>Thanks to their high cultivation, their protective auras activated automatically, preventing injury, though they were undoubtedly disheveled.</p><p>The White-robed Daoist righted himself.  A boundless white expanse surrounded them; they were still within the mist sea, but at their feet lay a wide mountain path leading upwards.</p><p>Kun Dao, adjusting her robes, approached.  “Senior brother, where have we been moved?”</p><p>The White-robed Daoist, confirming they were alone, relaxed, pondered for a moment, understood his situation, and his eyes lit up.  “Still within the array…”</p><p>While not directly transported inside like the most powerful cultivators, their situation was better than being caught in the initial wave, having escaped a major calamity.</p><p>They still held the advantage.</p><p>“Up the mountain!”</p><p>The White-robed Daoist decisively declared.</p><p>Now informed, Kun Dao calmed down and quickly followed.</p><p>…</p><p>The Jade Pavilion shattered, drastically altering the formation.</p><p>Before the mountain gate, Qin Sang's avatar and the Poison King both felt something and abruptly rose, staring intently into the depths of the Jade Gate.</p><p>The mist sea churned; boundless clouds surged upwards, propelled by an unknown force, quickly surpassing Di Shou Mountain's peak.</p><p>The already indistinct peak was completely swallowed by the clouds.</p><p>The mist tide continued its ascent into the sky. Its momentum suggested it aimed to breach the boundary of this secret realm.</p><p>Higher up, the clouds gradually thinned.</p><p>Slowly, a strange sight emerged from the mist—another sacred mountain!</p><p>A new sacred mountain had risen from the peak of Di Shou Mountain.  Or rather, this was the true Di Shou Mountain; its upper half had been concealed by the array, now revealed in its entirety.</p><p>The sacred mountain towered for thousands of meters, dwarfing even the highest peak of Central State.</p><p>A jade path led directly to the summit, extraordinarily wide, connected to the jade steps before them.</p><p>The Poison King and his companion saw Fan Lao Mo's mark, recognizing the mountain-shifting technique.  It seemed Fan Lao Mo hadn't deceived them.  They exchanged a glance, hesitated no longer, and stepped into the Jade Gate.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar, unsure of the cause, frowned at the sight.</p><p>His true body was inside; he wondered if this change was connected to him.</p><p>Just then, the avatar noticed the formation's transformation was far from over. The waves in the mist grew increasingly violent, and the jade steps behind the mountain gate began to collapse.</p><p>If they didn't seize this opportunity, further complications might arise, making entry much more difficult.</p><p>The avatar sensed no immediate danger.  After a moment's thought, he stepped into the Jade Gate.</p><p>…</p><p>The sacred mountain appeared.</p><p>This earth-shattering event was visible from any corner of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>East side of Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>The nuns of Yan Yue Monastery had just reached the Jinxiang Hall.  Looking up at the sky, they were astonished by the sacred mountain emerging from the clouds, then turned to their abbess, awaiting her decision.</p><p>Further east.</p><p>The Tu Xiang Hall dwarfed the other four halls.</p><p>The hall occupied dozens of mountain ranges.  Even more astonishingly, the Tu Xiang Hall was manipulating the earth's energy of these ranges, transforming a vast region into a single, unified formation.</p><p>Inside the Tu Xiang Hall, a figure moved back and forth—Yue Lingtian.</p><p>The changes in the Immortal Halls caused a rift between Yue Lingtian and the Daoist sect, leading him to the Tu Xiang Hall alone.  He was observing, but also highly valued the Tu Xiang lineage's legacy.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even with his cultivation, he faced obstacles within the Tu Xiang Hall.</p><p>Unknown to him, when the Wuxiang Immortal Sect channeled the earth's energy to establish the formation sealing the ancient demon and averting the demonic calamity, the main figure was the master of the Tu Xiang Hall. The Tu Xiang Hall's formation was far more complex than the other four and the best-preserved after the great battle.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Yue Lingtian stamped his foot, sending earth waves flying in all directions, reducing a nearly completed puppet to dust.</p><p>The surrounding peaks then shifted.</p><p>Yue Lingtian had identified the location of the Tu Xiang Hall's legacy hall. He coldly snorted, about to break the formation, then paused, turning towards the west, witnessing the sacred mountain's emergence.</p><p>“They’ve already gone in?”</p><p>His pupils constricted, he muttered to himself, hesitated for a moment, but decided to obtain the Tu Xiang Hall's legacy first.</p><p>Entrance to the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Outside the stone beach.</p><p>Two groups of Yuan Ying cultivators were facing off—the Daoist sect and the descendants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>They had both entered the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, encountered each other on the stone beach, and already fought, with the Wuxiang descendants slightly disadvantaged.</p><p>Then, the sacred mountain emerged from the Di Shou Mountain direction.</p><p>Seeing this from afar, they abandoned their confrontation and rushed towards Di Shou Mountain.</p>
