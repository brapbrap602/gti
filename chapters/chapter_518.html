<h1>Chapter 511: The Deal</h1><p>A few days ago, Qin Sang, disguised as a refining tool master, had become a consultant for a shop, openly appearing in the Sunny Market.</p><p>He interacted frequently with the Azure Sun Sect disciples, acting affable and helping them repair or refine magical tools at low prices. He would chat with them during his free time, subtly gathering information about the Azure Sun Sect.</p><p>Occasionally, he would offer them some pointers, appearing benevolent and caring for the younger generation.</p><p>[Read books and receive red envelopes] Follow the public account [Book Friends Base Camp] and draw up to 888 cash red envelopes!</p><p>Among them were many familiar faces he had seen at the Sky Spear Pavilion. They couldn't recognize that this person was the Clear Wind Daoist they held in high regard, but they felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang was very popular.</p><p>In reality, Qin Sang, under the guise of a corpse refining cultivator, had been discreetly contacting potential buyers for his refined corpses. Most of them were Qi Refining stage cultivators.</p><p>Foundation Establishment cultivators were still observing; a few corpses weren't worth making a big move for yet.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mind. He was sincere about the transactions. He had contacted many people and successfully sold four corpses, three of which went to Azure Sun Sect disciples.</p><p>This was normal. Azure Sun Sect disciples were generally wealthier than rogue cultivators and were very generous with their offers.  The corpses refined by Qin Sang were worth the price.</p><p>So far, eight refined corpses had been sold. Qin Sang still had one regular corpse and five Malignant Corpses.</p><p>Among these five Malignant Corpses was the Foundation Establishment mid-stage corpse remaining from the battle with Daoist Jiu Pao.</p><p>Of the fourteen Ghostly Yin Sect remnants, four were refined into Malignant Corpses, nine into regular corpses, and one was kept for other purposes.</p><p>A few days later, refined corpses appeared again in Sunny Market. This time, besides a regular corpse, there was also a Malignant Corpse, though its power was not particularly strong, even weaker than an ordinary early Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>However, this time, the reaction was noticeably different.</p><p>After the auction, the number of Foundation Establishment cultivators contacting Qin Sang through the Treasure Pavilion increased significantly.</p><p>Qin Sang was always cautious. Although his goal was the Azure Sun Sect, he wouldn't be foolish enough to reveal his true intentions and arouse suspicion. He simply sold to the highest bidder.</p><p>He discreetly sold another Malignant Corpse, but unfortunately, the buyer wasn't from the Azure Sun Sect.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang still had three Malignant Corpses. Two were late Foundation Establishment stage, which he intended to keep for himself, but for the sake of his Core Formation, he would sell them if necessary.</p><p>However, late Foundation Establishment Malignant Corpses were too conspicuous, and Qin Sang didn't dare to sell them easily.</p><p>Days passed.</p><p>With less than a month until the auction, the Treasure Pavilion suddenly relayed a message: a renowned expert from the Azure Sun Sect wanted to meet Qin Sang.</p><p>Upon receiving this news, Qin Sang's heart stirred. The person he was waiting for had finally arrived!</p><p>Suppressing his eagerness, Qin Sang arranged to meet this person two days later.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>The third day, evening.</p><p>Treasure Pavilion's quiet room.</p><p>Qin Sang, dressed in a black robe, entered the Treasure Pavilion and was led by the steward into the quiet room. Inside, a refined-looking middle-aged man, his face uncovered, was leisurely sipping tea.</p><p>Having lived in Sunny Market for twenty-eight years, Qin Sang was somewhat familiar with the Azure Sun Sect's prominent figures.</p><p>This man was named Wen Yanjie, a late Foundation Establishment expert. He was said to be generous and supportive of the younger generation within the Azure Sun Sect and had a good reputation. His mastery of the Azure Sun Devilfire was unparalleled.</p><p>"So it's Fellow Daoist Wen!"</p><p>After the Treasure Pavilion steward left, Qin Sang, feigning a hoarse and weathered voice, sat down opposite Wen Yanjie.</p><p>Wen Yanjie narrowed his eyes, set down his teacup, and scrutinized Qin Sang. "Fellow Daoist knows me?"</p><p>"It's hard not to," Qin Sang chuckled dryly. "Fellow Daoist Wen's fame is so great that everyone in Sunny Market knows you. Not only have I heard of you, but my ears are almost calloused. I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Wen to be interested in refined corpses. It seems my Malignant Corpses will fetch a good price."</p><p>Wen Yanjie said calmly, "Refined corpses are merely tools, no different from magical artifacts. I've always been interested in anything that can enhance my strength. As for the price, it depends on the quality of the corpses...  The kind auctioned a few days ago needn't be brought out."</p><p>Qin Sang understood. With Wen Yanjie's strength, ordinary Malignant Corpses wouldn't catch his eye. He opened his Corpse Puppet Bag and summoned the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Malignant Corpse.</p><p>"How about this one, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Wen Yanjie's eyes lit up. He extended his divine sense, scanning over the Malignant Corpse, then glanced sideways at Qin Sang. "Fellow Daoist is truly no ordinary person. No wonder I couldn't see through your cultivation! You probably have even stronger Malignant Corpses, don't you?"</p><p>Qin Sang countered, "Is this one not to Fellow Daoist Wen's liking?"</p><p>"Still too weak," Wen Yanjie shook his head, leaning forward slightly, his gaze fixed on Qin Sang, his voice low. "You must have late Foundation Establishment Malignant Corpses.  There's no need to hide them. Bring them all out, I'll take them all."</p><p>Qin Sang was certainly willing to sell, but Wen Yanjie's posture and tone implied a threat, making Qin Sang frown slightly.</p><p>He wondered if this man was fishing for information or doing this intentionally.</p><p>This person's true nature might not match the rumors.</p><p>He certainly wasn't afraid of Wen Yanjie. His understanding of Sunny Market was no less than any Azure Sun Sect member. The market had complex power dynamics, and after the Azure Sun Sect's decline, they couldn't control everything.</p><p>Even if he wanted to sell, he couldn't appear too weak, or Wen Yanjie would push his luck and create further complications.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He abruptly stood up and snapped, "What do you mean, Fellow Daoist Wen? Do you intend to force a sale?"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's stance, Wen Yanjie's eyes gleamed. "I was right. What are you hesitating for, Fellow Daoist? I have no shortage of top-grade artifacts. Name your price."</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly. "That Malignant Corpse is my trump card. I still rely on it to venture into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. What top-grade artifact can compare to such a powerful Malignant Corpse? Don't be delusional, Fellow Daoist Wen. I'll pretend I never met you today!"</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the Malignant Corpse and turned to leave, but Wen Yanjie flashed in front of him, blocking his path.</p><p>"What do you mean, Fellow Daoist Wen!"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned anger.</p><p>Wen Yanjie said calmly, "Don't misunderstand, Fellow Daoist. I'm sincere about this transaction. Take a look at this."</p><p>Wen Yanjie took out a jade box from his storage pouch. Inside was a small plant, entirely crimson red. As the jade box opened, it emitted waves of heat, suddenly raising the temperature in the quiet room.</p><p>"Firethorn Grass?"</p><p>Seeing this spiritual herb, Qin Sang was surprised. He hadn't expected this.</p><p>Firethorn Grass was indeed one of the remedies for corpse transformation afflictions.</p><p>"Indeed, Firethorn Grass."</p><p>Wen Yanjie nodded. "In your several transactions, you've sought such spiritual herbs. I surmise that Fellow Daoist was careless during corpse refinement, allowing corpse Qi and corpse poison to enter your body... Such urgency suggests your injuries aren't light, are they? Since you recognize Firethorn Grass, I needn't elaborate on its efficacy. How about trading this Firethorn Grass for your Malignant Corpse?"</p>
