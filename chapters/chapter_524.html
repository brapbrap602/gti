<h1>Chapter 517: Unexpected Encounter</h1><p>Chapter 517: Unexpected Encounter</p><p>Yu Baitian always took this route back to the sect.</p><p>A pungent smell of blood filled the mountain hollow.</p><p>As time passed, the wind dispersed the odor.  In the disordered hollow, a corpse lay prostrate in the weeds, lifeless.</p><p>Qin Sang lay inside the coffin, alert to his surroundings.</p><p>However, after waiting for almost half an hour, Yu Baitian still hadn't appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  Could it be that the boy hadn't finished enjoying himself and wasn't planning to return today?</p><p>If so, Qin Sang would have to activate his backup plan, but that would require extensive preparations and cause significant delays.</p><p>He worried that a prolonged wait would increase the variables and he wouldn't be able to suppress the corpse transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to wait another hour. If Yu Baitian still hadn't arrived after that, he'd assume he wasn't coming.  He'd only have himself to blame for missing out on this opportunity.</p><p>Confined within the coffin, unable to move, Qin Sang calmed himself, reviewed his plan from beginning to end, and then began to daydream.</p><p>Considering what he was doing, Qin Sang decided that if he ever encountered such an opportunity again, he'd think twice before acting.</p><p>The wind rustled through the treetops.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang inside the coffin stirred, instinctively straightening his body within the confines of the coffin.</p><p>Someone!</p><p>The person was still far away, but Qin Sang could vaguely sense someone using a concealment technique, flying towards him.  Whether it was Yu Baitian remained unknown.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang noticed the person's speed was slow, not what one would expect from a Foundation Establishment cultivator. He frowned again.  Could it be someone other than Yu Baitian?</p><p>Soon, the person flew over the mountain hollow.</p><p>She immediately noticed the unusual sight in the hollow.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang heard a gasp, "Ah!"—a woman's voice!</p><p>It wasn't Yu Baitian. Qin Sang's heart sank.  Everything had gone smoothly until now.</p><p>There was a whoosh, and the startled woman flashed into the forest, hiding herself.</p><p>Qin Sang remained quietly in the coffin, making no move.</p><p>Though his plan had been unexpectedly discovered, Qin Sang didn't immediately change course. He sensed the aura of the Azure Sun Demon Fire from the woman.</p><p>She was also a disciple of the Azure Sun Demon Sect!</p><p>However, her aura was unfamiliar.  Qin Sang hadn't encountered her in all his years in Azure Sun Market.</p><p>Their cultivation levels differed greatly.  Although the woman tried her best to conceal her presence, it was no match for Qin Sang's perception.</p><p>Interestingly, after her initial surprise at the scene in the hollow, she didn't flee but hid, seemingly believing herself to be concealed, remaining motionless.  She had clearly noticed the state of the corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed she was at the twelfth level of Qi Refinement, a hair's breadth away from Foundation Establishment.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang dismissed his distracting thoughts, closed off his spiritual sense, guarded his heart, and ignored the outside world.</p><p>A deathly silence fell over the coffin, as if it truly contained a cultivated corpse.</p><p>His plan had been compromised, and altering it would take too long. Since the newcomer was also a disciple of the Azure Sun Demon Sect, he might as well see where this went.</p><p>It all depended on the woman's courage!</p><p>The forests on either side of the hollow were eerily quiet, contrasting with the chaotic scene at the bottom.</p><p>After a while, a figure emerged from a thicket of trees—a seemingly young girl.</p><p>She was dressed like a wandering female martial artist, but her expression wasn't sharp; rather, it was somewhat weak, her eyes especially, as if she had just been crying, slightly swollen, with a clear, endearing look.</p><p>She carefully parted the leaves, peering down. Her gaze followed the trail of blood in the valley, settling on the prostrate corpse.</p><p>The storage pouch at the corpse's waist caught her eye.</p><p>She bit her lip, her face showing struggle and worry.  After a moment, she looked up towards where she had come from, and the worry in her eyes was replaced by intense hatred.</p><p>The girl gritted her teeth, summoning a small bird from the forest.</p><p>The bird landed on the girl's palm, struggling slightly before calming down.  She touched the bird several times with her finger, then released it.</p><p>The bird spread its wings and soared, flying to the mountaintops on either side, circling the area several times before rapidly returning.</p><p>The girl's tension eased somewhat. After hesitating for a moment, she pointed at the bird, then at the corpse. The bird immediately plunged down at an astonishing speed, striking the corpse's head.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The girl, Xia Que, shattered the corpse's head with the force of the exploded restriction.</p><p>WHOOSH!</p><p>The girl leaped from the bushes, swiftly grabbing the storage pouch beside the body.  She then incinerated the corpse with a burst of flame, erasing any trace of its presence.</p><p>About to leave, she noticed the coffin, untouched by the fire.</p><p>"A necromancer?"</p><p>She paused, surprised.  For a necromancer, their most valuable possession is their cultivated corpse. Now that the master was dead, the corpse was ownerless.</p><p>But why was the corpse inside the coffin unharmed?</p><p>Frowning, she seemed to remember something and quickly checked a jade slip within the storage pouch.  The more she read, the more astonished she became. A quick glance at the last section brought sudden understanding.</p><p>She grabbed the coffin, hoisted it onto her back, destroyed all traces of her presence in the mountain hollow, and fled.</p><p>She flew back to her sect with all her might, frequently looking behind her. Only when she neared the sect and saw no pursuers did she relax.</p><p>Clutching the storage pouch, excitement filled her eyes.  She had already noticed the countless treasures within – their quality and quantity were beyond her imagination.</p><p>She had obtained all the belongings of a Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p>And, even more precious to her than all the other items combined, the cultivated corpse.</p><p>Thinking of the corpse, she changed course, heading towards Qingyang Market. She landed in a secluded spot outside the market.</p><p>"Whew!"</p><p>She breathed out, her heart still pounding.  She crouched, patted her flushed cheeks, and gradually calmed herself.</p><p>Then, she eagerly took out the jade slip and studied it carefully. The secrets within were beyond her wildest dreams. She wondered if such powerful corpse cultivation techniques even existed.</p><p>She put away the slip and looked at the coffin. After a moment's hesitation, she donned two protective talismans, stepped back, and opened it.</p><p>Inside lay a corpse with a green face and sharp teeth, lying quietly.</p><p>Qin Sang 'saw' the girl's face and learned her true identity.</p>
