<h1>Chapter 1767: The Imperial Bell Talisman</h1><p>The menacing, sky-obscuring black clouds, after the appearance of the spiritual sword, immediately coalesced into a single mass, revealing the terrified eyes of the Black-Spotted Leopard Demon.</p><p>Even within the Ghost Fang Kingdom, the Black-Spotted Leopard Demon wasn't arrogant enough to confront a Grand True Master of the Five Talismans rank.</p><p>Marquis Liuhou was precisely worried about the Dao Court directly dispatching a Grand True Master to capture him, so he had been hiding outside for these past few years, not even daring to return to his own marquisate.</p><p>Pointed at by the sword's edge, the Black-Spotted Leopard Demon felt even more pressure than Qin Sang.</p><p>Every hair on the Black-Spotted Leopard Demon stood on end. It discovered with dread that it seemed as though only a single sword remained in its vision; all else in heaven and earth ceased to exist.</p><p>Centered around the Daoist, the surrounding spiritual energy of heaven and earth was mobilized by this spiritual sword. Within the jungle, winds surged and clouds churned, and the spiritual energy violently roiled. The sound of wind and thunder was deafening.</p><p>The mountain peaks at the jungle's edge trembled, and rivers stirred up monstrous waves.</p><p>Resplendent five-colored bands of light and five-colored points of light materialized in the void, summoned by the sword light unleashed by the spiritual sword, surging madly towards it.</p><p>These were the very manifestations of the mobilized spiritual energy of heaven and earth, now visible to Qin Sang and the Leopard Demon.</p><p>Even at his peak, Qin Sang couldn't achieve this. He could only barely stir the surface of the world's spiritual energy, utilizing the pressure of heaven and earth to suppress opponents, but he was incapable of manipulating it.</p><p>This tactic was quite effective against low-level cultivators but useless against those of the same rank. Victory still relied on magical treasures and divine abilities.</p><p>The phenomena created by the Daoist were too astonishing. Qin Sang suspected that even late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators would struggle to replicate it.</p><p>In the ancient texts he had read, only fragmented passages describing the divine abilities of Soul Formation cultivators matched such a scene.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Gale winds ravaged between heaven and earth.</p><p>The dense spiritual energy showed no signs of abating, continuing to gather. The sword light expanded at an alarming rate.</p><p>The attracted spiritual energy converged into a thick, five-colored mist.</p><p>The sword light seemed capable of absorbing the five-colored mist. As the mist frantically coalesced, it astonishingly formed a colossal five-colored sword that reached the heavens and touched the earth!</p><p>The sword's body tilted slightly, its tip piercing the clouds, pointing obliquely at the Leopard Demon.</p><p>A sense of insignificance washed over Qin Sang. It was as if this sword could effortlessly crush him, and he could only imagine the pressure the Leopard Demon was enduring.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A five-colored sword light suddenly appeared, brighter than lightning, illuminating the very limits of the sky.</p><p>The sword's momentum was world-shattering!</p><p>At this moment, it felt as though even the heavens were cleaved by the sword light.</p><p>The Black-Spotted Leopard Demon didn't even wait for the sword light to reach it. It had already fled, the black cloud exhibiting even greater speed than before, frantically escaping.</p><p>It had no intention of directly confronting this sword.</p><p>Sensing the terrifying might emanating from behind, the Leopard Demon glanced back, its heart pounding in its chest. It let out a low growl, its dark eyes turning completely crimson.</p><p>Simultaneously, its fur transformed into a blood-red hue, and strange runes appeared on its body, as if it had donned a suit of blood armor.</p><p>Then, the blood armor gathered towards its flanks, unexpectedly transforming into a pair of blood wings.</p><p>With a powerful flap of its blood wings, the Leopard Demon instantly became a streak of blood light, its escape speed dramatically increasing.</p><p>Blood light and sword light, one chasing the other, tore across the sky.</p><p>No matter how fast the Leopard Demon fled, it couldn't match the sword light. At this moment, the Leopard Demon sensed something amiss, yet it couldn't be certain. Its gaze flickered, its blood wings flapped, and a blood shadow remained in its place.</p><p>The blood shadow turned, fearlessly roaring as it charged towards the sword light.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>Unexpectedly, the sword light and the blood shadow dispersed together.</p><p>The giant sword, possessing the might to cleave the heavens, was as fragile as a bubble. It failed to strike the Leopard Demon's true body and was shattered by a mere blood shadow.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>As the sword light retracted, the gathered spiritual energy dissipated, the chaotic energy once again causing upheaval in heaven and earth.</p><p>Though the commotion was intense, it was too dispersed and chaotic. Even Nascent Soul cultivators wouldn't fear this level of turbulence. Only the surrounding plants and creatures suffered, the area reduced to a desolate mess.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Leopard Demon descended upon a mountain peak ahead. Looking at the spectacle behind it, the terror in its expression hadn't yet faded when it was replaced by fury.</p><p>Now, how could it not guess that this sword was merely a bluff, a hollow display of power? It couldn't compare to a true Grand True Master's strike.</p><p>If it had been a sword strike from a Grand True Master, it would already be dead.</p><p>In truth, when the Daoist unleashed that sword, the Leopard Demon had its doubts.</p><p>Rumors held that human Grand True Masters didn't act lightly. Once they left the Dao Court, they couldn't conceal their aura and cultivation. Moreover, if the Daoist truly were a Grand True Master, there would be no need to engage it for so long.</p><p>But circumstances were unpredictable, and who could be certain that a Grand True Master didn't possess a concealment method?</p><p>Furthermore, humans were skilled in talismans, capable of wielding power far beyond their own with spirit talismans.</p><p>If the Leopard Demon weren't cautious, it wouldn't have survived until now.</p><p>It was invited here as reinforcement. The plundered treasury wasn't its own. No matter how high Marquis Liuhou’s reward, it wouldn't risk its life testing the sword, not even entertaining the thought of probing.</p><p>Moreover, the sword's ability to mobilize the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, as well as its terrifying momentum, were undeniable.</p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth took a long time to settle.</p><p>With a grim expression, the Leopard Demon summoned its black cloud and returned along the same path. As expected, the jungle was empty; the two had long since vanished without a trace.</p><p>It scanned the surroundings, having lost track of them. Searching for them in the vast mountain range was akin to finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>The Leopard Demon pondered for a moment, sending out a message before setting off again, its search now less earnest than before.</p><p>To escape, the Leopard Demon had consecutively used its blood wings and blood shadow, both highly taxing divine abilities. It was now extremely wary of the Daoist and, by association, suspected Qin Sang was also hiding his true strength.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang and the Daoist, concealed in both aura and form, were flying amidst the mountains and forests.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his Spirit Wood form, while the Daoist applied a Concealment Talisman to himself. Although not as effective as Qin Sang’s innate ability, it was more than enough to deceive the demonic soldiers' senses.</p><p>Both knew they weren't truly safe yet. They flew on silently, occasionally exchanging brief words.</p><p>The Daoist had planned their escape route before taking action. Qin Sang naturally had preparations as well, but they had deviated quite far.</p><p>Continuing their flight, the two encountered more demonic soldiers, but to Qin Sang’s surprise, there was no sign of a large-scale demonic army blockading them, nor did they encounter any Demon Marquises.</p><p>Seeing the Daoist's composed demeanor, Qin Sang guessed that he might have made other arrangements, perhaps even having accomplices.</p><p>Several days later, the two finally reached the border of the Ghost Fang Kingdom.  Qin Sang’s greatest fear, an army blocking their path, didn't materialize.</p><p>Having escaped the Ghost Fang Kingdom with a mix of fright and relief, Qin Sang and the Daoist couldn't help but relax.  Confirming there were no immediate dangers, they stopped in a mountain hollow to meditate and recover.</p><p>“Many thanks, Fellow Daoist, for your protection along the way.”</p><p>The Daoist solemnly bowed in gratitude.</p><p>With his cultivation level, he wasn't originally capable of unleashing that sword strike. Forcing its execution had greatly depleted him.</p><p>Qin Sang kept his promise and didn't abandon him midway.</p><p>“This humble Daoist is called Zhijian. May I inquire as to Fellow Daoist’s Daoist title?”</p><p>The two had encountered each other twice, once briefly exchanging blows and once joining forces to escape the Demon Marquis’ pursuit, sharing a degree of hardship.</p><p>Strangely, they still didn't know each other's names.</p><p>Both times, the Daoist was at fault. Since Qin Sang didn't actively inquire, he found it inconvenient to ask. Finally, he couldn't hold back any longer.</p><p>“This humble Daoist’s title is Qingfeng.”</p><p>Qin Sang, having secretly instructed the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to remain vigilant, replied calmly.</p><p>The Daoist’s title was somewhat peculiar.</p><p>Zhijian, wielding which sword?</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  He hadn’t heard of anyone called ‘Zhijian’ among the prominent figures of Mount Crane Cry, but talented individuals were plentiful within and beyond the Daoist sects, so it wasn't surprising.</p><p>“That sword strike before…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was hesitant.</p><p>He vividly remembered Zhijian Zhenren’s sword strike and had hesitated several times to speak, fearing it involved the other's secrets.  A direct question would be too abrupt.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren didn’t mind. “You must have found it laughable, Fellow Daoist. That move of mine was somewhat of a bluff and consumed a Sword Talisman; it wasn’t entirely my own divine ability. Moreover, it has significant limitations. It requires prior preparation, generates a grand spectacle, and only at the instant the spiritual energy of heaven and earth coalesces into a sword does it exhibit a semblance of power. Afterwards, it's all for show. But who would be foolish enough to face it head-on?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.</p><p>However, he discerned that although Zhijian Zhenren was humble, he could indeed manipulate spiritual energy. Being able to achieve this, even with external aids, was sufficient proof of his profound mastery of the Sword Dao.</p><p>At this moment, Zhijian Zhenren suddenly changed the subject. “What did Fellow Daoist think of that Imperial Bell Talisman?”</p><p>The Imperial Bell Talisman was the very talisman that had transformed into a bronze bell for protection earlier.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally sang its praises.</p><p>His physical cultivation was only equivalent to late-stage Nascent Soul, yet with this talisman, he could withstand the attacks of a Demon Marquis, which sufficiently demonstrated its potent power.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang noticed that the talisman's potency was partially dependent on the wielder's physical cultivation. Once his physical body advanced further, this talisman could serve as a powerful means of self-preservation.</p><p>Hearing this, the Daoist smiled.  “Since Fellow Daoist appreciates it, this humble Daoist will gift you the refinement method for this talisman.”</p><p>Saying so, the Daoist flicked a jade slip towards Qin Sang.</p><p>“This humble Daoist has encountered Fellow Daoist twice, incurring two debts of gratitude.  I have nothing to offer in return but this small token of appreciation.  Please, Fellow Daoist, don't refuse. This talisman was also something I obtained by chance. It can only be utilized by physical cultivators and is like a pearl cast before swine in my hands. However, refining this talisman is extremely difficult. Fellow Daoist will have to put in considerable effort later on.”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment before accepting the jade slip. His divine sense swept over it, and its contents imprinted themselves upon his mind.</p><p>As Zhijian Zhenren had said, refining the Imperial Bell Talisman was no easy feat, something to consider after his breakthrough, at least.</p><p>As the saying goes, one doesn't bite the hand that feeds them. Having received the Imperial Bell Talisman, the reservations in Qin Sang’s heart diminished somewhat.</p><p>The two each consumed medicinal pills and seized the time to meditate and recover.</p><p>Once they had recovered, Zhijian Zhenren looked beyond the mountain hollow and asked, “Where does Fellow Daoist Qingfeng intend to go next? I hope this incident I caused hasn't disrupted Fellow Daoist's important matters.”</p><p>“This humble Daoist came here in response to a Dharma Decree. Fortunately, it was already completed before Fellow Daoist stirred up trouble at the marquisate.”</p><p>Qin Sang replied vaguely.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren seemed to be asking casually and didn't pry further. He nodded and said, “This humble Daoist’s cultivation grounds are at the Star Island Immortal Lake. I was just about to invite Fellow Daoist to accompany me there and offer proper hospitality. If Fellow Daoist isn't in a hurry, why not continue travelling together? Though the area ahead is not part of the Ghost Fang Kingdom, it's still under their control and might harbor Demon Marquis-level experts.  Encountering one by chance would be rather troublesome.”</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Star Island Immortal Lake before.</p><p>Located in the northern part of Mount Juzhi, it was a vast and boundless immortal lake, often referred to as a sea-lake.</p><p>As its name suggested, it contained countless islands like stars in the sky, harboring numerous factions in a complex web of relationships. It also housed the second most renowned immortal city of Mount Juzhi, second only to Mount Crane Cry.</p><p>It was said that this city was the true first immortal city recognized by the cultivators of Mount Juzhi.</p><p>Qin Sang was keen to witness the different sceneries of this world. Moreover, the complex Star Island Immortal Lake might offer greater opportunities to obtain fortune and Dharma treasures.</p><p>However, Qin Sang knew his current strength wasn't sufficient to wander freely in this world.</p><p>Mount Juzhi was in a state of turmoil, and he could be drawn into the conflict between the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom at any time.</p><p>With the Dream of Four Seasons Flower in hand and a breakthrough within reach, the most prudent course of action was undoubtedly to return to Mount Crane Cry swiftly and cultivate peacefully within the city.</p><p>After his breakthrough, it wouldn't be too late to venture out again.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Zhijian Zhenren and shook his head. “Thank you for your kind offer, Fellow Daoist, but this humble Daoist must return as soon as possible to return the Dharma Decree. I also have a faint sense of a breakthrough opportunity and am eager to enter secluded cultivation.  I’ll pay a visit another day.”</p><p>Hearing this, Zhijian Zhenren showed no displeasure, but instead expressed joy for Qin Sang. "Opportunities are rare.  There's no rush; we'll meet again. I offer my advance congratulations on Fellow Daoist’s success!”</p><p>“Thank you for your kind words, Fellow Daoist!”</p><p>…</p><p>The two didn’t part ways immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang knew little about these demonic kingdoms, so continuing to travel with Zhijian Zhenren was safer.</p><p>They traversed between the demonic kingdoms without incident, finally arriving safely in a secure area.</p><p>It was time to part ways.</p><p>However, Zhijian Zhenren called out to Qin Sang and took out a long wooden box. “I have an urgent matter and must return to Star Island Immortal Lake at once; otherwise, I would accompany Fellow Daoist to Mount Crane Cry.  A friend of mine cultivates at Mount Crane Cry, and he previously entrusted me with crafting a sword. Could I trouble Fellow Daoist to deliver it on my behalf?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>It wasn't that he was unwilling to help, but his acquaintance with the Daoist was limited to two encounters. While they had faced a demonic beast together, they couldn't be considered close friends.</p><p>If any mishap occurred during the delivery of the treasure, would their trust remain intact?</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren smiled, revealing the sword within the box, a supreme-grade Dharma treasure.</p><p>“This is nothing valuable. Does Fellow Daoist recall that token?  You will activate the token and inform me through that friend. If Fellow Daoist encounters any difficulties in the future, you can directly request his assistance. Once I learn of it, I will also come as quickly as possible."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  It sounded as if Zhijian Zhenren was finding a pretext to establish a firm connection with him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't object to this. He received the sword, examined it, bowed, and bid farewell, then proceeded southwest.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren stood still for a moment before soaring northward on his sword.</p><p>…</p><p>Returning smoothly to Mount Crane Cry, Qin Sang didn't rush to the Dao Court. He first activated the token and, guided by it, located a courtyard within the city.</p><p>The courtyard’s owner was already waiting outside the gate, a tall and slender Daoist in a green robe, whose Daoist title was Guzhou.</p><p>“Mid-stage Nascent Soul.”</p><p>Qin Sang discerned Guzhou Zhenren’s cultivation level with a single glance.</p><p>Guzhou Zhenren accepted the token and the sword, then looked at Qin Sang, his expression instantly turning respectful.</p><p>Seeing this, how could Qin Sang not understand? This person was likely not Zhijian Zhenren’s friend, but more like a subordinate.</p><p>“A mid-stage Nascent Soul expert stationed at a single base… Zhijian Zhenren seems to be connected to a rather powerful force.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. Befriending Zhijian Zhenren wouldn't be detrimental.</p><p>Soon after, Guzhou Zhenren escorted Qin Sang out of the courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang went straight to the North Pole Demonbane Institute.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
