<h1>Chapter 616: Healing</h1><p>With the Night Spectre by his side, even Golden Core cultivators posed no threat. Qin Sang consumed several more healing pills and finally regained his mobility.  Not wanting to frighten Yagu, Qin Sang ordered the Night Spectre to wait outside. He got out of bed, pushed aside the cloth curtain, and walked out.</p><p>Yagu, in order to earn more money to support their household, had been working late. Startled awake by Qin Sang, she was still drowsy.</p><p>She gasped, her face flushing crimson. She hurriedly got up to wash her face outside, then began preparing food for Qin Sang.</p><p>After Yagu finished washing, Qin Sang called her over and sat face to face with her. "Yagu," he asked, "Do you know about cultivators?"</p><p>Seeing Yagu's confused expression, Qin Sang recalled the man in animal hide. He tried again, "Divine Emissaries, you should know about them, right?"</p><p>Yagu nodded.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, then said in a serious tone, "I am a Divine Emissary."</p><p>Yagu's jaw dropped. She stared blankly at Qin Sang for a moment, then started to get up to cook again.</p><p>Exasperated, Qin Sang picked up a black stone from the hearth and crushed it into powder in front of Yagu. "Now do you believe me? Before I was injured, I was very powerful."</p><p>This time, Yagu was truly startled. She stared at Qin Sang in disbelief.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, took a bowl, filled it with water, then retrieved two spiritual pills. He pinched off a small piece from each and dissolved them in the water. He handed the bowl to Yagu.</p><p>"Yagu, you saved my life. I have no way to repay you, so let me heal your illness first. These pills can cure your muteness and the birthmark on your face. Take them, and you will become a normal person, with a bright future ahead of you."</p><p>He was fortunate that Yagu had rescued him from the river, giving him a safe place to heal. Otherwise, adrift in the river, he could have encountered unknown dangers.</p><p>Qin Sang's sudden revelation was a shock to Yagu.  She struggled to process this information, unconsciously accepting the bowl Qin Sang offered, and stood there, frozen.</p><p>"Don't be afraid, I won't harm you…" Qin Sang said softly, thinking Yagu was worried.</p><p>At this moment, Yagu suddenly put down the bowl, her expression urgent. She looked around, then grabbed a stone and quickly wrote on the ground: "Brother with the missing arm, are you leaving?"</p><p>The writing was deep and messy.</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. He nodded.</p><p>Seeing the sudden sadness in Yagu's eyes, Qin Sang realized she had misunderstood.  "Don't worry," he quickly said, "I'm only leaving temporarily, to heal. Your shaman grandfather mentioned a cave on that mountain, it's very safe. I can't stay here any longer. Your village elder already knows about me, and he'll definitely bring people to question you today."</p><p>Qin Sang pointed to a mountain peak across the river.  That mountain was taller and more treacherous, with cliffs on all sides, difficult for ordinary people to climb, but easily navigable for the Night Spectre.</p><p>Qin Sang's true reason for choosing that mountain was that its peak had the highest concentration of spiritual energy in the area, which would aid his healing. Moreover, he wished to avoid too much interaction with the villagers.</p><p>"I'll be back in a few days, after I've recovered. Take this."  Qin Sang retrieved a Soulbound Coin and gave it to Yagu. "Keep this coin. If you're ever in danger, crush it with a stone, and I'll know and come to rescue you immediately."</p><p>After the events with the Azure Sun Devil Sect, Wandering Scholar had returned the mother coin to Qin Sang.  There were still a few uses left of the Soulbound Insect's blood.</p><p>Qin Sang's spiritual sense was currently depleted, making it difficult to assess Yagu's spiritual root aptitude.  He couldn't teach her cultivation methods for now.  He would return after his injuries improved.</p><p>He certainly wouldn't stay here long, but before leaving, he wanted to settle his karmic debt.</p><p>If Yagu had the aptitude for cultivation, he would guide her onto the path, leaving her with cultivation techniques, artifacts, pills, and other items to help her defy fate and repay her kindness.  Even without the aptitude, he could improve her health, teach her martial arts, and make her a formidable warrior among mortals, free from bullying.</p><p>He gave Yagu the Soulbound Coin because she was currently defenseless. He wanted to prevent any unforeseen accidents that he would later regret.</p><p>Yagu clutched the Soulbound Coin tightly. The urgency and sadness on her face faded somewhat. She obediently picked up the bowl and drank the water.</p><p>'Gurgling...'</p><p>Not long after taking the medicine, Yagu's stomach suddenly gurgled.</p><p>Yagu froze, suddenly covering her face, and rushed outside.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for a long while before seeing Yagu walk back in, her face flushed. His gaze swept over her face, then he handed her a bronze mirror, smiling. "Take a look."</p><p>Yagu stared at her reflection in the mirror, transfixed.</p><p>Objectively, Yagu wasn't breathtakingly beautiful, nowhere near the stunning beauty of Chenyan or Granny Jing. But she was pretty and sweet, with a delicate frame and shy eyes, giving her the air of a girl next door.</p><p>Even this was something Yagu could only dream of before.</p><p>She had dreamt countless times of her birthmark disappearing, of becoming normal, no longer shunned, a life filled with laughter and joy. But upon waking, she would always face reality, never daring to hope those dreams would come true.</p><p>She held the mirror, gazing at her reflection, not daring to blink, afraid that the dream would vanish. Gradually, tears streamed down her cheeks.</p><p>After a while, seeing Yagu's emotions calming down, Qin Sang asked, "Anything you want to say now?"</p><p>"Ah…" Yagu instinctively tried to sign a response, but suddenly realized her throat felt different.  She hesitated, then, under Qin Sang's encouraging gaze, she timidly said, "Brother with the missing arm…"</p><p>This single phrase startled Qin Sang.</p><p>He hadn't expected that the unsealing would reveal such a captivatingly beautiful voice.</p><p>Like a nightingale's song, like an oriole's call, these words couldn't do it justice.</p><p>If Chenyan and Granny Jing possessed otherworldly beauty, Yagu's voice was equally heavenly, naturally perfect, a gift from the heavens.</p><p>Could it be that the damned Divine Spirit was jealous of this voice and sealed it away?</p><p>…</p><p>Dawn broke.</p><p>A black spectral figure nimbly climbed the cliff face, carrying a person on its shoulder without hindering its movement.</p><p>Soon, they reached the summit.  The spectral figure punched a hole in the rock face with ease, then stood guard at the entrance.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the cave and remained there for the entire day.</p><p>By nightfall, all of Qin Sang's injuries, except for his severed arm and depleted spiritual sense, had fully healed.</p><p>He didn't continue his secluded cultivation there.  He mounted the Night Spectre and departed, seeking a spiritual vein to cultivate, refine the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, form his Golden Core, and break the符!</p><p>He also retrieved the Bloodwing Hornet Swarm along the way.</p><p>Left unchecked for days, the swarming hornets could devour all life on a mountain. Fortunately, the western border was sparsely populated, mostly wilderness.</p><p>Whether to eliminate or retrieve them, Qin Sang couldn't allow the hornets to remain at large.</p><p>Until he figured out exactly where this western border was, he had to be cautious in all his actions, avoiding any risks of exposure.</p>
