Chapter 1280: The Illusion Pearl

The army advanced to the foot of Twin Mirror Mountain.
The scene on Twin Mirror Mountain at this moment was extremely peculiar.
The lower half of the mountain was engulfed in a blizzard, consistent with the weather outside, and spiritual senses could pass through unimpeded. It was clear that the Abyss of Sin had not set up any defenses here.
However, as one reached the summit, the scenery changed abruptly.
The summit was a vast expanse of azure, with rippling waves of water.
It was as if a massive lake had been inverted from the sky, enveloping Twin Mirror Mountain within it.
Any spiritual sense or probing technique that came into contact with those blue waves would immediately be repelled and blocked.
This was clearly a manifestation of a spirit array, and the Abyss of Sin was fully prepared.
Qing Jun slightly tilted her head, observing the grand array for a moment before confidently arranging her troops, showing no signs of hesitation.
In the past, she had been hindered by dark arts and had never truly revealed her full potential. However, she had never shirked her responsibilities as a cultivator of the Little Cold Domain, remaining on the battlefield and experiencing nearly every battle against the Abyss of Sin.
Qin Sang meticulously carried out Qing Jun's orders, and naturally, no one else dared to question them, each performing their duties diligently.
As Qing Jun and the others discussed methods to break the array, a female cultivator from the Heavenly Alliance suddenly stepped forward. "I have a plan that might directly incapacitate one of the Abyss of Sin's Nascent Soul cultivators."
This woman had a graceful figure, with features as delicate as a painting. Every smile and frown carried an enchanting charm. She wore a deep purple cheongsam, exuding an air of elegance and poise, as if surrounded by an intoxicating fragrance that lingered in the mind.
Judging by her appearance, she seemed like a gentle young matron.
However, she was a genuine Nascent Soul cultivator.
She had once been part of a fairy-like couple with her husband, envied by many. Unfortunately, her husband had failed to overcome the tribulation of reaching the Nascent Soul stage, and she had remained unmarried for the rest of her life.
As a lonely widow, she inevitably became the subject of gossip.
"Madam Luo, what is your brilliant plan?"
Hearing Madam Luo's words, everyone turned their attention to her.
However, her strength was not particularly outstanding among her peers, and her techniques were within the normal range. Over the years of battle, she had performed steadily but rarely stood out.
This was the first time she had taken the initiative to step forward.
Madam Luo's beautiful eyes turned, and she looked at Qin Sang, covering her mouth with a smile. "It's not a brilliant plan, but I do have a strategy. It all depends on whether Daoist Qin is willing."
Madam Luo had mastered the art of preserving her youthful appearance, and her charm was not something ordinary women could match. Her smile was captivating and pleasing to the eye.
Hearing this, everyone became even more curious, casting ambiguous glances at Qin Sang.
Qin Sang was naturally baffled. This was his first time meeting Madam Luo, and they had never interacted before.
"Madam Luo, please speak plainly. If it can be of help, I will certainly do my best."
Madam Luo nodded. "Daoist Qin, your reputation is widespread, and your achievements are astonishing. In truth, most cultivators of the Abyss of Sin are still unfamiliar with you. If we can catch them off guard, we will surely find an opportunity. I am skilled in illusion techniques, and here I have an Illusion Pearl that can allow Daoist Qin to disguise himself as me, while I take on your appearance..."
As she spoke, Madam Luo took out a blue pearl, which was the Illusion Pearl.
Without further explanation, everyone understood her plan.
The Abyss of Sin would not be overly wary of Madam Luo. If they could lure out an early-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, Qin Sang's strength would give them a good chance of capturing them.
However, this required Qin Sang to disguise himself as Madam Luo, and his demeanor and techniques could not show any obvious flaws.
Qin Sang's face twitched slightly.
"Madam Luo, you have such a technique? I've never seen you use it before."
Jing Lin expressed his surprise.
Madam Luo gently tapped the Illusion Pearl with her jade-like finger, and a miniature version of herself appeared inside the pearl. The expression was stiff, but the appearance was identical.
"This treasure of mine can be used for disguise, but it has significant limitations. It can be easily detected and cannot be used on cultivators whose cultivation surpasses mine, such as True One and Tongyou Daoists. Fellow cultivators of the same level are not much stronger than me. Although Daoist Xiang claims to be able to challenge those of higher levels, we all know there is still a considerable gap, making it difficult to achieve much. This technique can only be used once, so I have kept it as a trump card, waiting for the right opportunity. Finally, someone like Daoist Qin has appeared, capable of slaying the avatar of Elder Ye at the early Nascent Soul stage. This will surely yield extraordinary results!"
Madam Luo smiled as she looked at Qin Sang. "Daoist Qin, remember this: when the time comes, please ask Daoist Leng to activate the spirit array to provide cover. Once you encounter a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Abyss of Sin, strike without hesitation and do not let the opponent become alert. Additionally, we need to thoroughly discuss and imitate each other's mannerisms. If we reveal any flaws in this aspect, all our efforts will be in vain."
...
Qing Jun led the army up the mountain.
The two armies faced each other, and Twin Mirror Mountain remained eerily silent.
Qing Jun ordered the deployment of a grand array, making final preparations while also blocking the Abyss of Sin's cultivators from spying. Meanwhile, Qin Sang and Madam Luo, under the cover of the others, secretly entered a snow cave.
Qin Sang opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but then saw Madam Luo raise her jade-like hand. A white light flew out from the Illusion Pearl, forming a phantom of Madam Luo.
As the phantom approached, Qin Sang felt a stir in his heart and suppressed his true essence.
When the phantom merged with him, he felt no abnormalities. Only when he condensed water into a mirror did he realize that his appearance had drastically changed, transforming into another Madam Luo.
However, his movements and expressions were too stiff and unnatural. Even without the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, it was obvious that this was a fake.
Qin Sang instinctively touched his chest, feeling a surprising softness, as if it were real. Such a profound illusion technique!
Turning his head, he noticed that Madam Luo had already taken on his appearance and was looking at him with a strange expression.
Qin Sang coughed lightly and examined Madam Luo, praising, "Daoist Luo, you look quite dashing."
Madam Luo covered her mouth with a light laugh. "Daoist Qin, you look quite beautiful."
The awkwardness eased, and the two began to imitate each other's mannerisms.
Qin Sang was easy to imitate. Madam Luo didn't need to make any expressions; she only needed to act as the cold-faced gentleman, standing beside Qing Jun to assist her in controlling the spirit array. No one would suspect anything.
However, the boundless charm that Madam Luo had accumulated over the years was not so easily replicated. Moreover, Qin Sang needed to infiltrate the Abyss of Sin's camp personally to find his opponent, leaving no room for error.
Fortunately, Nascent Soul cultivators could control every inch of their bodies with extreme precision. Qin Sang patiently learned, receiving Madam Luo's full guidance, and made rapid progress.
Just as Qin Sang was practicing his alluring poses, Qing Jun entered without warning.
Her gaze shifted, recognizing that the Madam Luo before her was actually Qin Sang. Her beautiful eyes lit up, and the corners of her mouth curled slightly. "Junior Brother, you look quite charming."
"Thank you for the compliment."
The real Madam Luo laughed so hard that she swayed back and forth.
"To make the act complete, this is my commonly used treasure, the Kirin Hairpin. Daoist Qin, like me, cultivates wood-attribute true essence. Through the talisman mark I left, you don't need to specially refine it and can still unleash about seventy percent of its power. As long as the talisman's energy is not exhausted, you can freely activate it. In the enemy's spirit array, it's normal to be cautious. They shouldn't suspect anything..."
Madam Luo handed Qin Sang a jade hairpin. It resembled an ordinary phoenix hairpin, but one end was carved with a lifelike green kirin, a mythical auspicious beast.
