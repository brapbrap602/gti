Chapter 645: The Fat Silkworm


The Giant Ringed Earthworm always emerged from the swamp.  
It fed on poisonous gas, and before refining it, a miasma would form around its body, making it look countless times larger, comparable to a giant python.
This miasma, composed of pure poison gas, was even more potent than the swamp's toxic fog.
Whenever the Giant Ringed Earthworm appeared, it was easily spotted.
Within the poisonous fog, Qin Sang was unsure how far the scent of Redfire Gilded Gold could spread. He considered selecting multiple locations around the swamp's core.
The poisonous fog drifted like flowing water.
Qin Sang covered his mouth and nose, his eyes scanning back and forth.
Before long, Qin Sang's gaze suddenly fixed on the base of a large tree, a hint of joy flashing in his eyes.
He had smeared Redfire Gilded Gold on the tree trunk.
Now, a patch of grass growing at the tree's base was swaying, clearly not from the wind, but from the roots being disturbed, transmitting the force upwards.
Qin Sang pondered for a moment, deciding against directly probing with his divine sense. He chose to wait for the Giant Ringed Earthworm to surface and confirm its rank before acting, so as to avoid any missteps.
‘Rustle… rustle…’
The grass swayed more and more violently.
Gradually, the grass parted in the middle, mud gushing up, followed by a plump, multicolored worm clumsily crawling out.
This worm was quite plump, practically a small meat pillar, its entire body seemingly draped in a layer of rainbow silk, like a colorful silkworm. Its body, segmented like a fat man's belly, rippled with every twist.
Climbing from the mud onto the slippery grass stalks proved quite a challenge.
Like a mortal struggling after falling into water, it bobbed up and down, stirring the swamp and making it bubble, finally grabbing onto two grass stalks and pulling itself out of the mud. Then, it headed straight for the tree trunk.
Presumably, the Redfire Gilded Gold was too tempting to resist. The Fat Silkworm moved much more nimbly than before, climbing quickly.
Qin Sang stared at the Fat Silkworm, his face full of suspicion.
Especially when the Fat Silkworm scrambled up the tree trunk and eagerly licked the Redfire Gilded Gold, Qin Sang was even more confused, utterly baffled.
This was clearly not the Giant Ringed Earthworm.
Yet, Qin Sang couldn't find a matching name for it among known spirit insects.
Neither the Witch Insect List nor the Strange Insect List had it!
Upon seeing the Fat Silkworm, Qin Sang initially thought it wasn't a spirit insect, but just an ordinary bug that happened to be there.
However, seeing it rush towards the Redfire Gilded Gold, Qin Sang immediately dismissed his previous guess. This was definitely a spirit insect, but one without any record!
Silkworm-type spirit insects were not uncommon on the Witch Insect List, but they all had distinct characteristics. Even the legendary Witch God Insect, the nine-transformation immortal silkworm, was documented by the Witch Clan.
But none of them matched this Fat Silkworm in the slightest.
None had such chaotic colors.
Moreover, besides its color, the Fat Silkworm seemed unremarkable.
It showed no power, behaving like an ordinary worm. Qin Sang couldn't even tell what stage of transformation it was in, even suspecting it wasn't a spirit insect at all.
But the scene before him couldn't be denied.
The Fat Silkworm blissfully licked the Redfire Gilded Gold, its plump body swaying left and right, looking incredibly content.
After licking up the small amount of Redfire Gilded Gold, the Fat Silkworm released the tree trunk, plopped back into the mud, rolled over, and continued wriggling towards other spots smeared with Redfire Gilded Gold, feasting heartily.
The Redfire Gilded Gold's strong allure suggested it was indeed a spirit insect, just one unknown to both the Witch Clan and humans, or perhaps one that existed in ancient times but later went extinct, its records lost as well.
Giant Ringed Earthworms had a strong sense of territory.
If the Fat Silkworm was a spirit insect, it meant the Giant Ringed Earthworm had left the swamp.
Could this seemingly clumsy Fat Silkworm have driven away the Giant Ringed Earthworm? Did the Earthworm migrate voluntarily, or was this little guy actually quite powerful?
Qin Sang became serious. Years of experience told him that, like humans, spirit insects shouldn't be judged by their appearance.
With that thought, Qin Sang quietly opened his Mustard Seed Bag and summoned a Corpse Refinement.
The Corpse Refinement leaped down the tree trunk, stepping through the mud. The corpse energy emanating from it was apparent as it approached the Fat Silkworm.
Unexpectedly, the Fat Silkworm paid no attention, continuing to lick the Redfire Gilded Gold on the grass stalks, until the Corpse Refinement pinched its rear and lifted it up.
The Corpse Refinement turned around, facing the direction where Qin Sang was hiding, and raised the Fat Silkworm in its hand with an innocent look.
The Fat Silkworm struggled in the Corpse Refinement's grip, its upper body reaching towards the Redfire Gilded Gold, but it couldn't break free from the Corpse Refinement's powerful grasp.
It bit down hard on the Corpse Refinement's iron fingers, not even leaving a tooth mark.
Some liquid, perhaps saliva, got onto the Corpse Refinement's fingers, seemingly carrying a weak toxicity easily neutralized by the corpse energy.
The Fat Silkworm seemed to have truly exhausted its options, but it hadn't given up hope. It stretched its plump body, trying to reach the Redfire Gilded Gold.
Seeing this, Qin Sang was utterly speechless.
After a moment of thought, Qin Sang emerged from the shadows and flew over, wrapping his fingers in true essence as he picked up the Fat Silkworm. After examining it for a while, Qin Sang was certain: the Fat Silkworm wasn't pretending; it was genuinely that weak!
"What in the world is this thing?!"
Qin Sang had a headache, lamenting his recent bad luck.
He had wasted Redfire Gilded Gold and so much time, first attracting an excessively powerful Twilight Stinkbug, then luring out this useless Fat Silkworm.
Even newborn spirit insects weren't this weak.
Qin Sang held the Fat Silkworm, letting it lick up the remaining Redfire Gilded Gold nearby. The creature finally calmed down, falling asleep right on Qin Sang's finger.
It didn't seem to be transforming, just… full.
It devoured his Redfire Gilded Gold and dared to sleep on his hand.
Qin Sang wanted to throw it away, but the thought that this was a spirit insect not recorded in the Witch Insect List, so weak yet able to occupy the Giant Ringed Earthworm's nest and live in this terrifying poisonous swamp, gave him pause.
This place, besides the dreadful poisonous fog, was also home to many poison-loving demonic beasts, a truly dangerous land.
Finally, Qin Sang tossed it into his insect basket, planning to consult the Witch Clan's ancient texts later to see if he could find its origins.
The Fat Silkworm had disrupted his arrangements in this area. Qin Sang covered the insect basket and looked around.
"Has the Giant Ringed Earthworm truly left the swamp?"
Qin Sang was puzzled. Unwilling to give up so easily, he set up bait in three other directions around the swamp's core, continuing to lure.
Until the end, the Giant Ringed Earthworm didn't appear; it was truly gone.
So much effort, and all he got was a useless Fat Silkworm.
Without knowing the Fat Silkworm's true nature, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't choose it as his lifebound insect gu. At most, he could use the Spirit Controlling Sect's secret techniques to control it during its transformation.
Judging by its current foolish behavior, its future didn't look promising either.
Another wasted trip!
Qin Sang couldn't help but laugh wryly. He suppressed his frustration and continued to his next destination.
