<h1>Chapter 913: The Water Jade Physique</h1><p>Three figures, one man and two women, sat cross-legged on a flying shuttle, glancing back with fear etched on their faces as if something terrifying pursued them.</p><p>The man, a scholar, was pale as a sheet, clutching his chest and coughing incessantly, seemingly gravely injured.</p><p>The two women, a beautiful middle-aged woman and a girl who looked no older than fifteen, bore a striking resemblance, likely mother and daughter.</p><p>They appeared to be a family.</p><p>The shuttle was propelled by the combined efforts of the middle-aged woman and the scholar, both Foundation Establishment cultivators. It was unclear why they were in such dire straits.</p><p>The woman's condition was also precarious; her spiritual energy was nearly depleted, and she was barely holding on.</p><p>The girl, only at the Qi Refining stage, had an anxious expression on her pretty face. Unable to offer any real assistance, she merely supported the scholar, sobbing softly.</p><p>"Cough... cough..."</p><p>The scholar coughed violently, spitting out a mouthful of blood. His face grew even paler.</p><p>The shuttle shuddered, nearly plunging into the sea.</p><p>The woman cried out, gritting her teeth and drawing on her remaining reserves to stabilize the shuttle.</p><p>"Father..."</p><p>Terrified, the girl cried, supporting her father and frantically channeling her meager spiritual energy into him to suppress his injuries.  Her efforts were but a drop in the bucket.</p><p>"Husband, your injury..." the woman asked urgently, steadying the shuttle.</p><p>"It's nothing," the scholar waved his hand dismissively. "I was struck in the chest earlier. I finally managed to dispel the stagnant blood.  After spitting it out, I feel much better. You, however, should quickly take a spirit pill to recover your spiritual energy. Let me take over the shuttle. We'll need your strength later to escape that devil..."</p><p>The scholar swallowed the blood in his mouth and looked into the distance. He spotted a small island, unlike the other barren islands. Strange, multicolored mists swirled above it, with shadowy figures flitting within.</p><p>"That must be Poison Island.  The miasma and Rotwings are there!"</p><p>A flicker of hope appeared on the scholar's face. He hurriedly retrieved a jade bottle.</p><p>Inside were three dark pills.</p><p>As he opened the bottle, a foul stench filled the air.</p><p>Unfazed, the scholar poured out the pills, giving one to his wife and daughter.  "Quickly, take these Toadshade Pills. They will allow you to blend into the miasma and resist the Rotwings' poison for a short time."</p><p>The woman and girl swallowed the pills without hesitation.</p><p>The scholar looked at them with a deep affection in his eyes, quickly suppressing it.  "Wife, once we land on Poison Island, we'll split up. Your Red Tassel Canopy can conceal your presence. With the dense miasma on the island, even that devil won't easily find you. Seize the opportunity and escape with Ying'er immediately."</p><p>"Husband, you're planning to... No..." The woman's face paled, but the scholar cut her off with a wave of his hand.</p><p>"Wife!"  The scholar looked into her eyes, his voice grave. "When we fled to the Gale Archipelago, we knew this day might come. I've lived a lifetime longer than most mortals; I'm content. The Toadshade Pills can only protect us from the miasma and the lesser Rotwings' poison. We've already alerted their Gold Core devil, who likely has similar means. Only by drawing out the Rotwing King can we distract them.  It's our only chance to escape. You've always been resolute, even more so than a man. Don't let your emotions cloud your judgment now..."</p><p>Before the scholar could finish, the girl burst into tears. "Father! Mother! It's all my fault! Send me back! That devil probably wants to take me as a disciple..."</p><p>"Don't be foolish."</p><p>The scholar pulled the girl into his arms, stroking her back with a look of unbearable reluctance. With a final, gentle push, he rendered her unconscious and handed her to his wife.</p><p>"Wife, take care of yourself and Ying'er."</p><p>Tears streamed down the woman's face as she held her daughter tightly. Under the scholar's stern gaze, she finally nodded.</p><p>The scholar's expression softened, a smile gracing his lips.  "Don't worry, Wife.  I'll do everything I can to survive and reunite with you..."</p><p>Despite his words, he didn't mention a meeting place, and his wife seemed to have forgotten about it.</p><p>A heavy silence fell over the shuttle.</p><p>Soon, the shuttle reached Poison Island.  Its light dimmed as the woman recalled it. The scholar and his wife exchanged a glance and flew towards the island.</p><p>Just then, a deafening roar echoed from the distance. A grayish-black wind whipped up monstrous waves, relentlessly pursuing them.</p><p>"No! They're heading for Poison Island too! They've already landed!"</p><p>An old man in the black wind paled at the sight.</p><p>Four other Foundation Establishment cultivators stood beside him.</p><p>Their faces darkened, fear evident in their eyes. One spoke, "Poison Island is teeming with Rotwings, and there might even be a Demon King. Those fools are rushing to their deaths. We can't follow them to our graves. Fortunately, we noticed their suspicious movements early on and informed the Cave Master. He should be here by now..."</p><p>As he finished, a cold snort echoed in their ears. "A bunch of useless fools! You couldn't even stop two injured people. I had to come myself, nearly jeopardizing my important matters. Follow me onto the island and capture them. That girl is my designated cauldron. If anything happens to her, I'll flay you alive!"</p><p>Terror washed over their faces as they saw a faint shadow effortlessly pass them, flashing towards Poison Island.</p><p>"The Cave Master wants us to go to the island too. If we get poisoned, we might lose our lives..." one said anxiously.</p><p>The others also looked grim.</p><p>One sighed, "The Cave Master has given the order. Who dares disobey? Compared to facing the Cave Master's wrath, I'd rather die from poison on the island."</p><p>His words seemed to remind them of something, sending shivers down their spines.</p><p>The old man said gravely, "He's right. That girl possesses the Water Jade Physique. It's said that cultivating water-attribute techniques with it is incredibly effective.  While not a top-tier physique, it's quite rare. The demonic cultivation technique practiced by the Cave Master mentions a Water Jade Physique cauldron.  Now that he's found her, he won't let her go. We can only blame ourselves for not anticipating that the couple cultivated a joint technique. Their combined strength surged, catching us off guard and allowing them to escape. I have a few Antidote Pills here. Their effectiveness is limited, but they should protect you from the lesser Rotwings' poison clouds.  As for the Rotwing King, I doubt the Cave Master would send us to our deaths against it..."</p><p>They exchanged glances, seeing no other option but to obey. They thanked the old man, accepting the pills and swallowing them.</p>
