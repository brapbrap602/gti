<h1>Chapter 1189: Gongliang Yu</h1><p>Not long after waiting, Qin Sang heard footsteps approaching from outside and stood up to greet the newcomers.  </p><p>The one who arrived was none other than Elder Zhenyi.  </p><p>Behind him were two others.  </p><p>One was Senior Sister Qingjun, disguised as Leng Yuntian, and the other was an unfamiliar young man.  </p><p>The young man was tall and strikingly handsome.  </p><p>Strangely, his cultivation was only at the peak of the Golden Core stage, yet he stood beside two Nascent Soul Ancestors with an air of composure, showing no signs of timidity or subservience.  </p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue!"  </p><p>Before seeing the person, his voice was heard first.  </p><p>Elder Zhenyi strode into the hall, his face lighting up with delight upon seeing Qin Sang. "I have heard of Fellow Daoist Mingyue's exploits and have long wondered what kind of extraordinary figure you must be. Truly, seeing you in person surpasses all the tales!"  </p><p>"Elder Zhenyi, you flatter me too much. It was only with the help of Fellow Daoists Si Di and Jinglin that I managed to slay the demon Pei. My meager achievements pale in comparison to those of my fellow cultivators," Qin Sang replied modestly.  </p><p>Qingjun smiled faintly. "Elder Zhenyi was about to leave the city to attend to an important matter, but upon hearing of Fellow Daoist Mingyue's arrival, he rushed over without hesitation."  </p><p>Qin Sang turned to look at Senior Sister Qingjun.  </p><p>After arriving at Sandie Pass, they had secretly communicated several times, but due to the unpredictable nature of the war, they had not been able to meet in person.  </p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang had seen Senior Sister Qingjun since his breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage.  </p><p>In Qingjun's eyes, Qin Sang caught a glimmer of approval.  </p><p>Elder Zhenyi laughed heartily. "Fellow Daoist Leng is no different! Fellow Daoist Mingyue has just advanced to the Nascent Soul stage and has already slain a cultivator of the same level. If the other fellow Daoists weren't out on patrol, they would surely have come to witness Fellow Daoist Mingyue's brilliance!"  </p><p>With that, Elder Zhenyi gestured to the side. "Allow me to introduce Fellow Daoist Mingyue. This is the Sect Master of the Yuan Shen Sect, Fellow Daoist Leng Yuntian."  </p><p>"An honor to meet you!" Qin Sang pretended it was their first meeting.  </p><p>Qingjun clasped her hands in return.  </p><p>The two exchanged a knowing smile.  </p><p>Qingjun was well aware of Qin Sang's schemes and chose not to expose him in public.  </p><p>"This is the current Palace Master of the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace, Fellow Daoist Gongliang Yu..." Elder Zhenyi pointed to the young man.  </p><p>"Oh?" Qin Sang recalled something. "So you are the Palace Master of Shangyuan Qingjing Palace! My apologies for not recognizing you earlier!"  </p><p>"You flatter me. I have been stationed at Wangdong City and happened to come to Shiqu Mountain for some business. It is my great fortune to meet Fellow Daoist Mingyue!" Gongliang Yu replied courteously, neither humble nor arrogant.  </p><p>As the Palace Master of Shangyuan Qingjing Palace, even without having reached the Nascent Soul stage, he was qualified to stand as an equal among them.  </p><p>It had been a long time since Shangyuan Qingjing Palace had a Nascent Soul Palace Master.  </p><p>Qin Sang remembered that the previous Palace Master was Tie Guanzi, who was also at the peak of the Golden Core stage. They had met once before entering the Purple Micro Palace. Now that Gongliang Yu had taken over, it was likely that Tie Guanzi had perished.  </p><p>However, Shangyuan Qingjing Palace had never fallen from its position as a major orthodox sect. This was the strength of a great sect—even without a Nascent Soul cultivator, they possessed methods that could make Nascent Soul experts wary.  </p><p>The four great secret talismans of Shangyuan Qingjing Palace were the Heavenly Blade Talisman, the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, and the Inner Landscape Primordial Talisman—all of Golden Core level.  </p><p>The last one, however, was not a simple talisman but a talisman puppet.  </p><p>And it was a Nascent Soul-level talisman puppet!  </p><p>However, Qin Sang had heard that the Nascent Soul talisman puppet of Shangyuan Qingjing Palace could not venture too far from the sect and was primarily used to protect the sect. Otherwise, Shangyuan Qingjing Palace would not have needed to ally itself with Shaohua Mountain.  </p><p>Of course, this alliance was more of a mutual partnership rather than subordination.  </p><p>After exchanging pleasantries, the four of them sat down in the hall.  </p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue, your slaying of a Nascent Soul from the Sin Abyss is a great achievement. We have already recorded a significant amount of merit for you. If there is anything you wish to exchange for, I will ensure that my people spare no effort to find it for you," Elder Zhenyi said enthusiastically.  </p><p>He had already received messages from Jinglin and Si Di, informing him that this demon king was not hostile to humans and was willing to assist the alliance of the two regions. Naturally, he wanted to win Qin Sang over.  </p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and said, "There's no rush for now. I have just advanced and have yet to fully comprehend the Dao. I will seek your help when I have a clearer idea of what I need. Perhaps there will be more merits to come in the future."  </p><p>In truth, his cultivation path was already set, and he was practicing two techniques simultaneously.  </p><p>His life-bound magical treasure had also reached its limit for the time being.  </p><p>There were only two things left: one was to refine a treasure to subdue the South Ming Flame, and the other was to cultivate the "Seed of Fire, Golden Lotus" technique, starting with the ancestral sacred flame of the Qingyang Demon Sect.  </p><p>For the first, he already had some ideas, but they were not yet fully formed, so he was unsure what materials he would need. For the second, he would need to consult Meigu and investigate the situation of the Qingyang Demon Sect before making a decision.  </p><p>In any case, the alliance of the two regions would not withhold his merits, so he could wait until he needed them.  </p><p>Hearing that Qin Sang intended to stay and continue assisting, Elder Zhenyi was overjoyed and readily agreed.  </p><p>Next, Qin Sang inquired about the latest developments and learned that the Sin Abyss was being particularly stubborn this time, showing no signs of retreating.  </p><p>Elder Zhenyi, on the other hand, was concerned about the Soul-Shattering Spike and the Soul-Extinguishing Tower.  </p><p>Attacks targeting the soul were unpredictable, and the power displayed by the Soul-Shattering Spike had alarmed everyone. The alliance of the two regions had already discussed this matter multiple times.  </p><p>Qin Sang did not hide anything and recounted the events of that time.  </p><p>He subtly probed Elder Zhenyi for information but found no evidence linking the Sin Abyss to the ancient demons.  </p><p>After a private discussion, Qin Sang stated his purpose for coming.  </p><p>Elder Zhenyi immediately ordered someone to bring the demon soldiers over. The request for Qin Sang to command troops had already been approved earlier, but due to the tense situation, it had not been possible until now.  </p><p>Qin Sang bid farewell to Elder Zhenyi and, guided by a cultivator, met the old macaque in a side hall.  </p><p>These days, the old macaque had been hearing endless tales of Demon King Mingyue slaying a Nascent Soul cultivator, and his ears were practically calloused from it.  </p><p>Finally seeing Qin Sang, the old macaque couldn't hold back his tears, saying that with the master here, the king could finally rest easy.  </p><p>Perhaps influenced by Fat Chicken and White Crane, the little demons of Thousand Bamboo Sea now all addressed Qin Sang as "master."  </p><p>"Gather the demon soldiers and return to Sandie Pass. Once you've settled your troops, go back yourself and secretly inform Willow Demon to have White Crane and the others set sail together. Find a hidden sanctuary in the icy seas as quickly as possible, as far from the mainland as you can," Qin Sang issued an order.  </p><p>The old macaque was startled. "Master, is the situation not looking good?"  </p><p>This time, the Sin Abyss had not only failed to gain any advantage but had also lost a Nascent Soul cultivator.  </p><p>Everyone thought the Sin Abyss was nearing its end and that the alliance of the two regions was gaining the upper hand.  </p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slowly. "It's hard to say. It's better to prepare for the worst and secure a retreat in advance. By the way, remember to inform Li Yufu as well."  </p><p>He was alone and could leave at any time.  </p><p>The little demons of Thousand Bamboo Sea were the most difficult to handle, so having them find a sanctuary early would prevent chaos in case of an emergency.  </p><p>The matter of establishing a sect would also have to wait.  </p><p>"As you command!"  </p><p>The old macaque did not dare to question Qin Sang's judgment and immediately set off to carry out the order.  </p><p>Qin Sang remained in the side hall.  </p><p>After a while, a ripple passed through the void.  </p><p>Qingjun, now without her disguise, appeared in her familiar red dress.</p>
