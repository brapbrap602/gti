<h1>Chapter 532: Forcing a Passage</h1><p>Qin Sang, hidden in the shadows, overheard Wu Youdao's words.  Realizing that if he didn't seize the opportunity to leave the Qingyang Demon Sect, he might never escape, he decided to act swiftly.</p><p>After giving instructions to the others, Wu Youdao flew towards the inner sect.</p><p>Once Wu Youdao's figure disappeared, Qin Sang emerged from hiding and stealthily approached the mountain gate. The situation had deteriorated; his only option was to force his way out.</p><p>Qin Sang prepared himself for a battle with Wu Youdao. With his current strength, he had a fighting chance. However, he couldn't fight within the Qingyang Demon Sect; otherwise, he stood no chance of winning. He planned to wait until Wu Youdao was preoccupied with the Ancestral Saint Fire at Shen Gang Peak before making his move, increasing his chances of escape.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was strategizing, a vessel suddenly appeared in the sky outside the Qingyang Demon Sect—the same bean-shaped vessel from before, but moving even faster than before!</p><p>"So fast?"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected the others to return so quickly.  Wu Youdao certainly hadn't reached Shen Gang Peak yet, but Qin Sang knew he couldn't wait any longer and made his decision.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his energy, utilizing his movement techniques to conceal his presence, racing towards the mountain gate.</p><p>At the stele, six people stood guard, startled by the approaching vessel. They waited for their fellow sect members to return before reactivating the formation to seal the sect gates, as instructed by Wu Youdao.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The vessel sped through the air, drawing closer, the sound of its approach like thunder.</p><p>At that moment, the most senior among the six, an elder, sensed something and abruptly turned to look behind him. He quickly scanned the area beneath the stone platform.</p><p>The area below the platform was a sheer cliff face, barren and extremely precarious.  Only halfway up the mountain did the slope become gentler, and while the lower slopes were covered with pines and cypresses, everything was still visible.</p><p>Everything seemed normal.</p><p>The others, noticing the elder's unusual behavior, followed his gaze but saw nothing.  Seeing the elder's furrowed brow, they were puzzled and asked, "Senior Brother, what are you looking at...?"</p><p>The elder scanned the area again, shaking his head doubtfully. He hesitated, "Perhaps it was just my imagination.  I don't know why, but just now..."</p><p>Before he could finish, a sharp light flashed in the elder's eyes. He suddenly threw a punch, sending a powerful blow towards the edge of the stone platform, shouting, "Get out!"</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The punch instantly reached the edge of the platform, only to be stopped by an invisible barrier, freezing in mid-air before silently shattering.</p><p>"What was that?!"</p><p>The others finally saw a green-faced, fanged figure appear out of thin air, looking like a demon, which startled them.</p><p>The monster had been lurking so close, yet they hadn't noticed it at all.</p><p>Furthermore, this monster had emerged from within the sect!</p><p>Qin Sang was also surprised.  Given his skill at concealment, he shouldn't have been discovered so quickly.</p><p>Then, he noticed a strange connection between the elder who had discovered him and the stele.</p><p>Qin Sang understood immediately. It wasn't a failure of his concealment technique; the elder must have been the one controlling the formation, using the stele to detect his presence.</p><p>This minor setback did not deter Qin Sang.</p><p>His presence was revealed.  Without a word, Qin Sang propelled himself from the stone platform, his figure like lightning, rushing towards the mountain gate.</p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p>The elder reacted swiftly, shouting sharply.</p><p>The others hurriedly summoned their weapons.</p><p>Three of the five possessed identical bronze cones, each seemingly infused with the Qingyang Demon Fire, the two elements appearing perfectly integrated.</p><p>However, they were too slow.  Qin Sang arrived in an instant.  With a thought, his ebony sword shot out even faster, unleashing terrifying sword energy.</p><p>"A magic weapon?"</p><p>The faces of the others were filled with shock.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The ebony sword severed a flying sword and left a deep gash on a bronze cone, nearly destroying both weapons.</p><p>Their terrified expressions showed their fear; they dared not engage the ebony sword directly and scattered to avoid it.</p><p>Their courage broken, Qin Sang, having achieved his goal, didn't press his advantage.  Escape was paramount, and he immediately sheathed his sword and fled.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as he was about to pass the stele, it suddenly emitted a brilliant light.</p><p>A dazzling beam of light shot into the sky, audible for miles around. Then, Qin Sang's vision blurred, and a thin, translucent barrier appeared before him.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.  He glanced around and saw an old man hiding behind a stone stele, his hands forming strange hand seals, his face grim as he watched.</p><p>"Who are you? What is your purpose in infiltrating my sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered inwardly, ignoring the old man. He gripped his ebony sword and with all his might, thrust it at the energy barrier.</p><p>He knew he wouldn't be able to break through a complete formation.  But this was a hastily erected barrier by the old man alone, not fully activated, and significantly weaker.  Furthermore, Qin Sang was attacking from the inside, and the stele primarily served to repel outside intruders.</p><p>A loud shout echoed from the inner sect. Qin Sang knew without looking that Wu Youdao had been alerted.</p><p>‘Crack… crack…’</p><p>The energy barrier was struck by the ebony sword, cracks appearing.</p><p>A few more strikes, and it teetered on the verge of collapse.</p><p>At that moment, a flame, swift as a shooting star, surged from the inner sect, crossing the outer mountains in an instant.  Simultaneously, Wu Youdao's furious roar, filled with killing intent, echoed.</p><p>"Who dares trespass on Qingyang Sect!"</p><p>Though Qin Sang didn't turn, he felt Wu Youdao's approach, the overwhelming pressure pressing down on him.</p><p>Terror gripped Qin Sang. He relentlessly fueled his corpse pill, his sword strikes accelerating.</p><p>Finally, the energy barrier, unable to withstand the assault, shattered with a resounding ‘boom’.</p><p>Qin Sang broke through, relief washing over him.  Without hesitation, he soared into the air, intending to escape.</p><p>But then, Qin Sang felt a fierce gust of wind from behind.  The wind carried a sharp, cutting edge, even sharper than his ebony sword.</p><p>"Get back here!"</p><p>Wu Youdao bellowed.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare be careless. He flickered, shifting several meters in the nick of time.  He caught a glimpse of a Qingyang demonic flame and a bronze cone narrowly missing him.</p><p>The bronze cone, encased in the demonic flame, was different from Wu Youdao's.  Wu Youdao’s lower-grade magic treasure was wrapped in swirling golden light. As it spun, the cone itself created a strange vortex, seemingly capable of drawing one's consciousness in, its speed incredibly fast.</p><p>Glancing at it, Qin Sang ignored the cone and continued his escape!</p><p>He was now outside Qingyang Sect, no longer worried about a blocked retreat. However, he needed to retrieve the treasure he'd left outside before he could safely engage Wu Youdao and find a chance to escape.</p>
