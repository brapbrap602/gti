<h1>Chapter 504: Worldly Affairs</h1><p>The shopkeeper frantically shoveled away the snow with a coal shovel.</p><p>Under the snow, there was indeed a frozen corpse.</p><p>“Quick… Go report to the authorities…”</p><p>Someone had died in front of his shop, and the shopkeeper was frightened out of his wits.</p><p>The corpse was lying face down, arms outstretched, fingers desperately clutching the ground.</p><p>He had struggled to crawl forward, seeking help from the shopkeeper, but had collapsed and frozen to death just steps away from the bun stall.</p><p>Just a few steps.</p><p>A few steps that felt like an insurmountable chasm.</p><p>The shopkeeper, regaining some composure, crouched down and wiped the snow off the body. Seeing the deceased dressed in rags, he sighed, “It's old man Qi. I wondered why he didn’t come by this morning…”</p><p>Qin Sang slipped out of the crowd and quietly left.</p><p>…</p><p>The capital of Guyuan.</p><p>The Imperial Palace.</p><p>On this snowy night, the Emperor's bedchamber remained brightly lit, emanating warmth.</p><p>“Get out!”</p><p>A furious roar suddenly shattered the night's tranquility.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The tray and bowl of soup a palace maid was carrying were flung away by the ruler of Guyuan, who was propped up in his bed.</p><p>The medicinal soup splattered across the floor, its pungent odor filling the room.</p><p>The maid, covered in the dark liquid, collapsed to the floor, pale and trembling.</p><p>“I deserve death!”</p><p>“Your Majesty, calm yourself!”</p><p>…</p><p>Instantly, a sea of figures prostrated themselves on the ground.</p><p>On the dragon bed, the ruler of Guyuan flung aside his thin quilt and attempted to get up, but his frail body failed him. He swayed, and was only saved from falling by a quick-thinking palace maid.</p><p>He pushed her away, trying several times to stand, but to no avail.</p><p>Disheveled and distraught, he lay on the bed, pointing at a richly dressed young man and shouting deliriously,</p><p>“Go… Go to Dragon Mountain again and invite the Immortal Master! As long as… As long as he cures my illness and grants me immortality, I’m willing to give him half my kingdom and share my riches…”</p><p>The young man in fine clothes was the Crown Prince of Guyuan.</p><p>The Prince crawled to the bedside and said softly, “Father, don't worry. I’ll go to Dragon Mountain and implore the Immortal Master. If he doesn't appear, I will kneel until he does. I will bring him down the mountain to cure your illness…”</p><p>“Immortality! I want immortality!”</p><p>The ruler of Guyuan pounded the bed frame, eyes bloodshot, glaring at the young man with a terrifying expression.</p><p>Shaohua Mountain was strictly governed, forbidding cultivators from interfering in mortal affairs.</p><p>And Guyuan was a small, insignificant nation. Its ruler was not worthy of the attention of Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>The Prince dared not disobey, attempting to appease his father. “Yes, yes… I will definitely ask the Immortal Master to bestow the secret of immortality…”</p><p>“Go now!”</p><p>Finally, the ruler calmed down, at least for the moment.</p><p>The Prince and the officials filed out of the bedchamber.</p><p>With the ruler gravely ill, the Prince was in charge of state affairs. However, instead of immediately rushing to Shaohua Mountain, he returned to his study, dismissed his attendants, and sat brooding on his throne, lost in thought.</p><p>Just then, the door creaked open.</p><p>The candlelight flickered.</p><p>An armored general slipped inside, his voice urgent. “Your Highness, are you truly going to obey His Majesty's decree and hand over half of Guyuan to a so-called immortal?”</p><p>The Prince replied coldly, “Uncle, do you want me to disobey a royal decree and become known as unfilial and disloyal?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare!”</p><p>The general strode forward, his imposing figure blocking the candlelight and casting the Prince's face into shadow.</p><p>“The late Emperor ruled with filial piety, but not blind obedience. I just interrogated the royal physician. His Majesty is critically ill, his mind clouded. The physician says it’s a type of hysteria. I happen to know a renowned physician skilled in medicinal wines. He is currently a guest in my residence. He can concoct a colorless, odorless medicinal wine that can cure this ailment…”</p><p>The general's voice trailed off.</p><p>After a long silence, the Prince slowly closed his eyes and nodded slightly. “Go.”</p><p>…</p><p>Late at night.</p><p>The ruler's bedchamber.</p><p>An old eunuch, his face etched with panic and fear, hurried through the palace. He stumbled over the threshold and fell as he pushed open the door to the bedchamber.</p><p>“Your Majesty!”</p><p>“Wake up, Your Majesty!”</p><p>“Wake up!”</p><p>The old eunuch scrambled to the bedside and shook the sleeping ruler of Guyuan vigorously.</p><p>The ruler awoke with a start, his eyes still clouded with sleep.</p><p>The old eunuch cried, “Your Majesty, be careful, the Prince intends to…”</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>A sharp sword pierced through the old eunuch’s throat. The blood-stained tip startled the ruler fully awake. He saw that the one holding the sword, the one who had just murdered his loyal servant, was his own son, the Crown Prince!</p><p>The Prince's usual deference had vanished, replaced by an icy indifference.</p><p>“Traitor!”</p><p>The ruler roared in disbelief and fury.</p><p>The Prince dropped the bloody sword, glanced at the general beside him, and strode out of the bedchamber without looking back.</p><p>The general clamped a hand over the ruler’s mouth and forced the poisoned wine down his throat.</p><p>The poison took hold.</p><p>As his life ebbed away, the ruler's eyes glazed over, yet he still clung to his obsession.</p><p>“Immortality… I want immortality…”</p><p>…</p><p>Dragon Mountain.</p><p>Commoners lived in the town of Fortune at the foot of the mountain, while those seeking immortality built huts on the rear slopes.</p><p>There was a drafty hut in the forest.</p><p>‘Knock, knock, knock…’</p><p>“Brother Zuo… Brother Zuo, are you awake…?”</p><p>A disheveled man knocked on the door, but received no response.</p><p>He pushed and shoved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge. He hurried off to find help.</p><p>A short while later, he returned with several others, and together they forced the door open.</p><p>Inside the hut, they found a thin, frail young man sitting cross-legged on a straw bed, his head slumped, seemingly lifeless.</p><p>“Brother Zuo is dead!”</p><p>The man exclaimed.</p><p>But then, a surprising thing happened.</p><p>Instead of grief, his friends showed signs of elation, crowding around the young man.</p><p>One said, “Brother Zuo has ascended!”</p><p>Another said, “Brother Zuo, by enduring hardship and communing with the immortals, has finally attained enlightenment.”</p><p>Another said enviously, “Brother Zuo's unwavering devotion has moved heaven and earth. He must have been summoned by the immortals to ascend to paradise and achieve immortality.”</p><p>…</p><p>It was a scene of utter pandemonium.</p><p>Follow our public account: Book Friends Headquarters.

He returned to Returning Dragon Abbey, paused in thought, and suddenly dispelled the mist surrounding Dragon Mountain, then drifted away.</p><p>The dense fog that had lingered for countless years suddenly vanished. This unprecedented event sent the immortality seekers into a frenzy.</p><p>“The fog is gone!”</p><p>“The immortals are accepting disciples!”</p><p>“Hurry up the mountain…”</p><p>Hearing the commotion outside, the people in the hut exchanged glances and rushed out.</p><p>At that moment, the young man they believed to be dead suddenly lifted his head, stood up shakily, ate some snow to fill his empty stomach, and stumbled towards the mountaintop.</p><p>But at the summit, he found only a dilapidated temple, no immortals.</p><p>The young man collapsed to the ground, devastated.</p>
