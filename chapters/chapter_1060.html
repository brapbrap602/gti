<h1>Chapter 152: Tribulation of Nascent Soul</h1><p>The Deer Demon King was slain.</p><p>Two Demon Kings were severely wounded.</p><p>The others also suffered injuries of varying degrees.</p><p>Their attempt to cross the swamp had come at a heavy cost.</p><p>The edge of the swamp bordered another towering mountain range.</p><p>They stood at the foot of the mountains and looked up. This mountain seemed identical to the previous one, a barren, rocky peak. However, its summit was shrouded in clouds and mist. The Flood Dragon King felt a sense of oppression, a foreboding premonition.</p><p>To find the Dragonâ€™s remains, they still needed to cross this mountain range.</p><p>After careful consideration, he turned and said, "Nine Phoenix, please help protect us while our fellow Daoists heal their injuries. Blackie and I will scout ahead to see if there's a path around this mountain."</p><p>The Flood Dragon King and the heavily armored man detoured around the foot of the mountain.</p><p>This mountain range was exceptionally vast, with peaks stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p>They bypassed several mountains and finally found a cliff face. Between two mountains was a deep, narrow path, winding its way to the other side of the range.</p><p>After a brief discussion, the two demons squeezed into the path one after the other. They traversed carefully and reached the other side without incident.</p><p>Surprisingly, the space here was stable, with few spatial rifts, allowing them to directly see the Immortal Prohibition above.</p><p>The two sides of the mountain range were like two different worlds.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain was a rocky beach, devoid of vegetation. A faint grey mist drifted in the air, which, compared to the gloomy swamp, was practically bright.</p><p>Besides a few hills, there were no taller peaks within sight.</p><p>It was an open expanse.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>The Flood Dragon King began to speak, but his expression suddenly tightened. A faint black mist appeared on his face without any warning.</p><p>In an instant, his face turned as dark as the bottom of a pot.</p><p>"Poison!"</p><p>He cried out in alarm and swiftly formed a hand seal, pressing it firmly against his chest.  Employing some unknown secret technique, golden light shone from his palm, coalescing into a small golden flood dragon that submerged into his body.</p><p>The golden light quickly spread throughout his entire being.</p><p>The Flood Dragon King coughed up a cloud of black mist, which vanished into thin air before his very eyes.</p><p>The armored man only noticed the poisonous mist entering his body after the Flood Dragon King's warning. He also used a secret technique to refine the potent poison.</p><p>"Colorless and odorless poison!"</p><p>The Flood Dragon King's expression was grave. "This is the U Valley!"</p><p>...</p><p>Trial Realm.</p><p>Some time after Venerable Ye and the others left, Qin Sang returned to the Stone Peak Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>The treasures had already been divided.</p><p>As he entered the pavilion, he was transported to the cliff face within the inner hall.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately concealed his figure and aura, observing his surroundings. After confirming that no one else was around, he retrieved a topographical map from his Spatial Ring.</p><p>This map, obtained from Ning Wu Hui, was more detailed than the information he had gathered himself.</p><p>"There..."</p><p>Comparing his location with the terrain on the map, Qin Sang identified his position and quickly flew towards the meeting point he had agreed upon with Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>He had delayed for quite some time to fulfill his promise to Su Nu, and he wondered how long Ning Wu Hui had been waiting.</p><p>This area near the entrance of the inner hall was the safest place within, as the beasts had been hunted and the most dangerous ancient restrictions had been deciphered by their predecessors.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the environment of the inner hall as he traveled.</p><p>"Worse than the Violet Firmament Palace!"</p><p>This was Qin Sang's assessment of the Seven Kill Hall.</p><p>Aside from a few known secret areas like the Heavenly Mountain, even Foundation Establishment cultivators could explore the Violet Firmament Palace. The Seven Kill Hall was clearly far more dangerous.</p><p>Furthermore, while the Violet Firmament Palace was lush and vibrant, the Seven Kill Hall exuded an aura of deathly stillness.</p><p>He raised his head, gazing at the Immortal Prohibition.</p><p>The glow obscured everything.</p><p>If the ancient teleportation formation was within the inner hall, how had he fallen from above the Heavenly Tower through the Immortal Prohibition and then been transported away? Did Senior Qing Zhu do something, or was there another reason?</p><p>"Could the ancient teleportation formation be inside the Immortal Prohibition?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>He bypassed several mountain peaks, noticing the flickering restriction lights on some of them, indicating that people were breaking restrictions and searching for treasures.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang arrived at the rear of a mountain.</p><p>Their agreed meeting point was in a secluded stone pavilion within a mountain valley behind this peak.</p><p>The stone pavilion was ancient, bearing the marks of time.</p><p>He found the pavilion effortlessly, but Ning Wu Hui was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed inside but found no markings. He and Ning Wu Hui had agreed that if one had to leave the pavilion due to unforeseen circumstances, they would leave a mark to inform the other.</p><p>"Ning Wu Hui isn't here yet!"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>He himself had been delayed long enough, but he hadn't expected Ning Wu Hui to be even later!</p><p>"Could he be trapped in the Trial Realm?"</p><p>Recalling the Thousand Mountains Formation in the third stage, Qin Sang couldn't help but worry.</p><p>With Ning Wu Hui's strength, barring any accidents, he was capable of competing for the Soul Cleansing Liquid. At the very least, he should have been among the first group to reach the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui hadn't participated in the competition for the Soul Cleansing Liquid and still hadn't emerged from the Trial Realm.</p><p>If he wasn't adept at handling illusion formations, being trapped in the Thousand Mountains Formation would be troublesome.</p><p>Qin Sang felt uneasy, but he also considered that besides the Soul Cleansing Liquid and magical treasures, the Trial Realm also contained rare spiritual herbs that were difficult to find in the outside world. Perhaps Ning Wu Hui had other objectives.</p><p>"Forget it. I overexerted myself, and my True Essence hasn't fully recovered. I'll wait for him while I recover."</p><p>Without Ning Wu Hui, Qin Sang couldn't do anything, so he patiently set up an isolation restriction in the pavilion, held spirit stones in his hand, and began to cultivate.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's True Essence was replenished, and he was fully recovered.</p><p>He opened his eyes, still not seeing Ning Wu Hui, and retrieved the Soul Cleansing Liquid from his Spatial Ring.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his divine sense, carefully sensing the medicinal power of the Soul Cleansing Liquid. His Nascent Soul felt incredibly comfortable, as if the liquid contained abundant soul power.</p><p>It wasn't an exaggeration to say that consuming the Soul Cleansing Liquid would greatly enhance one's divine sense.</p><p>"Soul Cleansing Liquid, Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid, Natal Insect Gu..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered his future.</p><p>Even if he couldn't return to the Small Cold Realm, forming his Nascent Soul wasn't entirely hopeless. As he calculated, there shouldn't be any obstacles in the way.</p><p>He could start thinking about how to overcome the Nascent Soul Tribulation.</p><p>However, upon further reflection, Qin Sang realized that his tribulation would be much easier than others'.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Tribulation included the Three Disasters Tribulation, such as the Lightning Tribulation, and the Heart Demon Tribulation. The most terrifying part wasn't the Three Disasters Tribulation but the Heart Demon Tribulation!</p><p>When a cultivator was nearing the end of their lifespan, facing the formless and immaterial Heart Demon Tribulation, they were even more helpless. Countless cultivators had failed at the final hurdle due to the Heart Demon Tribulation, ultimately perishing.</p><p>Protected by the Jade Buddha.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't fear the Heart Demon Tribulation. Moreover, he possessed two top-grade magical treasures, giving him some resistance against the Three Disasters Tribulation. He only needed to gather some spirit arrays and pills that aided in overcoming tribulations and refine a few necessary treasures for the tribulation.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Tribulation, which terrified countless cultivators, didn't worry Qin Sang as much.</p><p>As long as he could smoothly cultivate to the peak of the Core Formation stage and break through the bottleneck, his Nascent Soul would be unimpeded!</p><p>Just as he was lost in thought, he suddenly sensed a fluctuation. His expression shifted slightly as he put away the Soul Cleansing Liquid, withdrew the restriction, and walked out of the pavilion.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ning!"</p><p>The newcomer was indeed Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>"I'm late, Fellow Daoist Qin. Please forgive me for making you wait," Ning Wu Hui landed beside Qin Sang, cupping his hands apologetically.</p><p>A strange glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>He vaguely sensed that Ning Wu Hui seemed somewhat different than before, but he couldn't pinpoint the reason.</p>
