<h1>Chapter 1794: Comprehension</h1><p>Boom!</p><p>Li Hou, carried by the sword light, crashed into the ground, his head twisted at an unnatural angle, lifeless.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled slowly, his vital energy surging and receding like a tide.</p><p>Though powerful, the True Treasure fragment demanded a terrifying consumption of True Essence, beyond the capacity of ordinary cultivators.  Despite absorbing vast quantities of Wood Spiritual Qi, the Dao Manifestation Tree couldn't fully withstand the impact, and his vital energy showed signs of instability. This battle had not been easy.</p><p>His primary limitation was his divine sense.</p><p>Deploying such an intricate sword formation, sealing Heaven and Earth, and trapping a mid-Nascent Soul Demon Marquis placed immense demands on his divine sense.</p><p>As time wore on, Li Hou repeatedly assaulted the sword formation, relentlessly analyzing its patterns.  Unbeknownst to him, Qin Sang's outwardly calm expression masked a deeply tense mind.</p><p>He had to reserve sufficient divine sense to suppress the Qilin Source Seed, lest all his efforts be for naught.  The remaining divine sense had to be meticulously managed.</p><p>Not only did he need to maintain the sword formation and theç½¡ Fire Shield, but he also had to hold back enough power to unleash the Four Chariots Azure Serpent Seal spiritual treasure at any moment, guarding against Li Hou's desperate counterattack.</p><p>A mid-Nascent Soul expert's power at the brink of death was bound to be astonishing.</p><p>Even if Li Hou possessed some mutually destructive technique, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.  He remained vigilant throughout.</p><p>"After ascending the Five Thunders Secret Art, my True Essence is fully restored, but before refining the Qilin Source Seed, I must still rely heavily on my physical body..."</p><p>Qin Sang mused, gazing at the sky.</p><p>Having successfully slain Li Hou, the danger hadn't passed.  Uninvited guests lingered nearby.</p><p>His battle with Li Hou had concluded, but the tremors within the jungle space persisted. The thunder in the sky continued unabated, growing fiercer.</p><p>Long scars appeared on the azure sky barrier, stretching across the expanse. These were signs of violent impacts, the sky barrier tearing apart.</p><p>From the aura seeping through, he could sense that the source of the tremors wasn't the chaos created by the golden light, but cultivators battling nearby!</p><p>He didn't know who the newcomers were, nor which side held the advantage.</p><p>To avoid further complications, Qin Sang dared not delay. He had no intention of capturing Li Hou alive and had struck with all his might, ensuring the Demon Marquis's demise.</p><p>Even without unforeseen circumstances, capturing him alive would have been unlikely.  The corpse of a mid-Nascent Soul Demon Marquis was sufficient to earn him the qualification for ascension.</p><p>He had to thank the uninvited guests outside.  They had given Li Hou a glimmer of hope, allowing the desire for survival to take precedence, quelling any suicidal thoughts. Moreover, the turmoil of facing death had left him vulnerable to the Heaven Severing Soul Needle. The virulent poison entered his body unhindered, resulting in his instant demise.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>The sky barrier, composed of azure qi masses, was agitated by the powerful fluctuations from outside.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang looked at the sky barrier, a section caved inward, as if a colossal force from beyond was pushing down, threatening to collapse the heavens. Cracks immediately appeared within the depression.</p><p>Through the fissures, Qin Sang saw a familiar petite figure slam hard against the sky barrier, letting out a sharp cry.</p><p>"Realist Youhuang!"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.</p><p>Realist Youhuang stood upon a large, silver-basin-like spiritual flower, which grew amidst countless thick vines. The vines writhed like serpents around her. As the sky barrier cracked, the vines coiled together, protecting her within.</p><p>He could clearly see that what had sent Realist Youhuang flying was a tremendously powerful grey qi.</p><p>She wasn't injured, but some of the protective vines had snapped, others withered, losing nearly half their number in a single blow.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the vines pierced deep into the sky barrier, forcibly stabilizing themselves within the void. Realist Youhuang, without hesitation, threw out a blue pearl.</p><p>The pearl transformed into a long ribbon, swirling in the void. It appeared light and delicate, yet as it danced, it emitted the sound of wind and thunder. With a powerful flick, it dispersed the pursuing grey qi.</p><p>At the same time, a figure flew forward, blocking Realist Youhuang's path.</p><p>This person wore armor, his entire body radiating surging vital energy. Though standing within the void, he seemed like an unyielding pillar, his spiritual spear pointed obliquely forward.</p><p>"Realist Guyun! I didn't expect they weren't scattered..."</p><p>As Qin Sang recognized the two, Realist Youhuang also glimpsed him below. A flicker of joy crossed her tense face, quickly replaced by seriousness. Her lips parted slightly, as if about to speak.</p><p>Just then, the grey qi, repelled by the ribbon and rolling back, swiftly coalesced, forming a grey orb that landed in the hands of a burly man.</p><p>The man's eyes were a strange greyish-white, his fingers webbed, clearly not human.</p><p>Beside him stood a woman, radiant as a flower. She wore a jeweled crown and colorful robes, a pure crystal embedded in her forehead. Five-colored light swirled within the crystal. Her appearance surpassed even Realist Youhuang in beauty, yet her almond eyes held a chilling killing intent.</p><p>Both sides were equal in number, but Realist Youhuang's side was at a disadvantage.</p><p>"Let's see how far you can run!"</p><p>The crowned woman snarled, the crystal on her forehead blazing brightly as five beams of spiritual light shot out.</p><p>The five beams, each a different color, transformed into five dazzling rainbows, emitting an incredibly sharp aura, like five spiritual blades, slashing towards the two realists.</p><p>The burly man, not to be outdone, swallowed the grey orb. With a leap, his throat pulsed, his cheeks puffed out, and he opened his mouth to spew a cloud of breath towards the two realists.</p><p>In an instant, grey clouds formed above the two realists' heads, a strange power permeating the void.</p><p>They felt a sensation of sinking into the depths of the sea, the surrounding light, even the void itself, seemingly distorted, creating an inexplicable sense of unease.</p><p>Realist Guyun straightened his body, his spiritual spear splitting into a myriad of spear shadows, then abruptly converging. With a single thrust, he fiercely pierced the oncoming five-colored rainbows, ignoring the grey clouds above.</p><p>The ribbon, still swirling in the air, connected its ends, twisting to form a rune, springing high into the air.</p><p>A loud bang reverberated as the grey clouds shuddered violently.</p><p>One cultivated the Dragon and Tiger Altar, the other the Golden Seal Altar, complementing each other perfectly.</p><p>Unfortunately, their opponents were stronger.  The burly man's aura matched theirs, but the woman was a late-Nascent Soul Demon Marquis!</p><p>Initially, the two realists, like Qin Sang, had sought to regroup with their companions after becoming separated.  They had reunited mid-way, only to encounter powerful enemies.</p><p>It was fortunate they were together, or they might have faced certain death.</p><p>Even so, they were being pursued relentlessly, only able to evade their pursuers while hoping for the golden light to fade, allowing them to seek aid from their comrades.</p><p>As she unleashed the ribbon, Realist Youhuang discreetly dispersed the sky barrier's qi, mending the cracks and obscuring the scene below.</p><p>A hurried transmission followed, "Fellow Daoist Qingfeng, quickly recover. We can hold them off for a while."</p><p>Qin Sang had just slain Li Hou, his energy severely depleted, and hadn't had time to recover. Even through the sky barrier, Realist Youhuang could sense his weakened state.</p><p>Having reached her current cultivation level, she wasn't one to simply shift trouble onto others. Buying time for Qin Sang to recover and join the fight was their best chance of repelling the enemy.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as the cracks in the sky barrier closed, Realist Youhuang heard a tearing sound behind her.</p><p>Two withered giant hands pierced through the sky barrier, grasping wind and clouds, pulling forcefully to the sides.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The sky barrier ripped open!</p><p>The fissure spanned hundreds of feet.</p><p>The violent fluctuation drew everyone's attention.  A giant, resembling a tree spirit, burst through the sky barrier, gazing intently at the two Demon Marquises, his eyes radiating a ferocious aura.</p><p>At the same time, they glimpsed the scene within the jungle.</p><p>Most striking was the deep pit at the jungle's center, where a badger beast lay motionless, covered in mud.</p><p>The two Demon Marquises' faces paled.</p><p>"Marquis Li!"</p><p>The burly man's puffed cheeks froze in shock, unable to believe his eyes.</p><p>Sensing the approaching aura, he shuddered and immediately retreated.</p><p>The crowned woman, seeing the badger beast in the pit, confirmed it was indeed Li Hou, equally incredulous.</p><p>Li Hou's cultivation was comparable to her own, entrusted with an important mission, yet he had died here inexplicably.</p><p>"This person..."</p><p>The crowned woman's gaze, sharp as a blade, fixated on Qin Sang.  This being, neither fully human nor demon, clearly possessed lower cultivation than Li Hou.</p><p>Was his divine ability that powerful, or did he have other helpers?</p><p>A sudden fear gripped her.  Exchanging a glance with the burly man, without hesitation, they turned and fled.</p><p>Qin Sang also stopped, not pursuing.</p><p>He had no desire to hunt down more Demon Marquises. Firstly, his divine sense was limited, and the True Fixation Pill's effects wouldn't last much longer. Secondly, using the Spiritual Wood Body restricted him to the jungle space.</p><p>Using Li Hou's corpse to scare off the enemy was the optimal choice.</p><p>Confirming the two Demon Marquises were truly retreating, not feigning a withdrawal, Qin Sang nodded to the two realists and returned to the jungle space.</p><p>The two realists followed, flying down and offering their thanks.</p><p>Qin Sang, having dispelled his Spiritual Wood Body and revealed his true form, quickly moved through the jungle, collecting a few treasures.</p><p>They belonged to Li Hou, items used during the fierce battle. Unfortunately, even his bone awls couldn't harm Qin Sang, only slowing his attacks.</p><p>After clearing the battlefield, Qin Sang flew to the deep pit.</p><p>Small trees had already sprouted near the pit, growing rapidly, becoming a lush canopy in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The two realists hovered above the pit, watching Qin Sang's busy movements, exchanging glances.</p><p>Realist Youhuang hesitated for a long moment before softly asking, "This... is truly Marquis Li?"</p><p>Qin Sang stored the demon corpse, nodding with a smile. "It was also due to my luck. I encountered Marquis Li when he was gravely injured.  In fact, I must thank the two of you.  You distracted Marquis Li at the crucial moment, allowing me to seize the opportunity."</p><p>"Is that so? Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Qingfeng..."</p><p>Realist Guyun chuckled dryly.</p><p>He surveyed the surroundings.  The vegetation here grew at an incredible speed.  In a short time, many traces of their battle had already been erased, as if little damage had been done.</p><p>Such an explanation was barely acceptable.</p><p>Li Hou rarely appeared on the battlefield, his reputation not widespread, yet he was a late-Nascent Soul expert, on par with the female demon who had chased them.</p><p>To say Qin Sang had single-handedly slain a Li Hou at full strength was truly unbelievable.</p><p>However, judging by the True Essence fluctuations emanating from Qin Sang, they could tell he had taken the True Fixation Pill, indicating the battle hadn't been easy.</p><p>Being able to kill an injured Li Hou was enough to prove his exceptional strength.</p><p>It was unclear how much the two realists believed, but they didn't press further.</p><p>Realist Youhuang said, "The demons might gather reinforcements. This place is unsafe!  I recall a relatively safe illusory realm. We might take shelter there until the golden light dissipates, then contact the other realists.  If we can't reach them, we'll leave the Ju Shan Zhi Altar first and then decide what to do."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qin Sang agreed.</p><p>The three immediately left the jungle space.  This time, with helpers to resist the illusory realm's fluctuations, Qin Sang let the Heaven's Eye Butterfly focus on vigilance.</p><p>The journey was smooth.</p><p>Finally, they arrived at a peculiar location.</p><p>It resembled an inverted grey wind pouch, with visible air currents being sucked into its interior, producing a whistling sound.</p><p>"This is it. Once, a fellow Daoist was accidentally pulled into this wind pouch, only to discover inside is simply a space of wind, with no danger. Those who don't understand its nature certainly wouldn't dare enter, making it a suitable hiding place..."</p><p>Realist Youhuang pointed to the wind pouch, explaining.</p><p>After further investigation, confirming no abnormalities within the wind pouch, they entered.</p><p>The piercing wind whistled in their ears.</p><p>The wind here was merely mundane wind. Though strong, it posed no threat to Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>After a brief exchange with the two realists, Qin Sang chose a spot and sat down, closing his eyes.</p><p>The two realists, observing the meditating Qin Sang, exchanged meaningful looks before settling into meditation themselves.</p><p>The wind pouch space wasn't exactly tranquil.</p><p>Qin Sang guarded his mind, replaying the battle's events, but soon immersed himself in cultivation.</p><p>What drew his complete focus was, naturally, the *Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter*.</p><p>This wasn't an ideal cultivation location, but Qin Sang discovered that after the intense battle with Li Hou, he had gained further insights into the cultivation method and the Dao of Slaughter, far exceeding his expectations!</p><p>It was far greater than the gains from hunting the Thunder Turtle and the Wood Jiao.</p><p>"Why are the gains this time so significant?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>Comparatively, all three were mid-Nascent Soul.  The difference was that Li Hou had been at full strength, and he had slain him alone.</p><p>In this battle, he had exerted nearly all his power.</p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p>Enlightenment dawned upon Qin Sang as he recalled his journey cultivating this technique.</p><p>Before Golden Core, he comprehended the intent of slaughter from endless killings, brimming with murderous intent.  After breaking through to Nascent Soul, the technique's murderous nature began to diminish, indiscriminate killing becoming useless.</p><p>At the Nascent Soul realm, could it be that he needed to constantly challenge stronger opponents, tempering himself in life-or-death situations, to grasp the true meaning of the Dao of Slaughter?</p><p>With this thought, combined with the scriptures within the cultivation method, Qin Sang felt he had found the right path.</p><p>This caused him to frown slightly.</p><p>Throughout his cultivation journey, he had always sought stability.  Unless it involved a struggle for opportunities, he rarely took risks.  Facing opponents of higher realms, he would never act without absolute certainty.</p><p>But if he wanted to quickly comprehend the true meaning of the Dao of Slaughter and elevate his cultivation, he had to constantly challenge stronger foes.</p><p>His style conflicted with this cultivation method.  How to balance the two in the future required careful consideration.</p><p>Fortunately, he wasn't weak among Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang cleared his thoughts. Feeling the True Fixation Pill's effects fading and his True Essence showing signs of instability, he suppressed his cultivation to late-Nascent Soul.</p><p>During this time, Realist Youhuang occasionally left the wind pouch, releasing talismans.  After using several, she finally received a response!</p><p>"It's Realist Zhijian and Realist Zhang."</p><p>Realist Youhuang returned to the wind pouch, showing the talisman to the two. "They're together, not far from us. They're asking us to meet them quickly, saying there are other fellow Daoists there as well."</p><p>"Who else is here now?" Realist Guyun asked.</p><p>"The golden light hasn't completely dissipated, so they didn't have time to elaborate.  It seems to be people from the Dao Court," Realist Youhuang said.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his meditation, noticing the questioning gazes of the two realists. After a moment of contemplation, he said, "Let's go."</p>
