<h1>Chapter 2128: The Tide Turns</h1><p>Edge of the Tainted Lands.</p><p>Compared to its peak, the Tainted Qi had receded for thousands of miles. Several elders of the Chang You Clan, leading the clan's experts, stood guard at the edge, gazing at the vast expanse of exposed sea, hesitant to make a move.</p><p>The volatile nature of the Tainted Qi could激发 the ferocity of the monstrous beasts. Although it was rare for these beasts to surge out from the Tainted Lands, caution was paramount.</p><p>Among the group, a blue-haired man stared intently towards the north.</p><p>“Tenth Elder, there's no need to worry. Those outsiders are preoccupied; how would they dare to divert troops to contest the Azure Spirit Qi?” A cultivator clad in green armor beside him said with a hint of schadenfreude.</p><p>“Caution is still advisable. Most of our clan’s experts are tied down on the battlefield…”</p><p>The blue-haired man was indeed the Tenth Elder of the Chang You Clan. He turned his gaze towards the depths of the Tainted Lands. “In a few days, the Tainted Qi will recede to the designated location, yet the Clan Leader hasn't issued any decrees. A while ago, the Young Clan Leader sent a message that the Clan Leader suffered severe injuries and returned to the Sacred Lake to heal. I wonder how his recovery is progressing.”</p><p>“If the Clan Leader could come personally, success would be assured,” the green-armored cultivator said.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>The Tenth Elder nodded slightly.</p><p>A Void Realm Second Stage expert, even injured, wasn't someone a Void Realm First Stage cultivator could challenge.</p><p>As they spoke, the Tenth Elder’s expression suddenly shifted. He retrieved a jade talisman, sensed it for a moment, and then said in a deep voice, “The Clan Leader's decree: once the Azure Spirit Qi appears, seize it immediately. Disregard all other concerns!”</p><p>To the north of the Chang You Clan's hiding place, another group lay concealed – experts from the Xuan Tian Palace, dispatched by Tong Lingyu.  However, their numbers and strength were inferior to the Chang You Clan. The Xuan Tian Palace was vast and powerful, with numerous Spirit Altars to maintain.  Mustering these few individuals was already a considerable effort.</p><p>Before even facing their opponents, they knew they were at a disadvantage. Fortunately, their Palace Master didn't hold excessively high expectations. They were simply to do their best.</p><p>None of them detected the faint aura concealed behind them.</p><p>Qin Sang’s Dharma Idol was hidden within the clouds. The auras of the Chang You Clan cultivators were clearly perceptible to him. He didn't attack, but waited, observing whether Clan Leader Min Zhuo would appear.</p><p>Min Zhuo's injuries were inflicted by his own hand and should have been severe, unless Min Zhuo possessed some miraculous healing medicine.</p><p>Qin Sang had patiently waited until now, and the Chang You Clan experts displayed no unusual activity. There was no trace of Min Zhuo’s aura.</p><p>As the Tainted Qi was about to recede to the designated location, Min Zhuo remained absent. If Min Zhuo hadn't come, it suggested his deduction about the Azure Spirit Qi might be incorrect.</p><p>At this moment, near a distant reef, ripples occasionally disturbed the sea’s surface. A fish would sometimes breach the water, its eyes alert, glancing towards the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators before sinking back down.  Like an ordinary fish, it swam around the reef.</p><p>The fish was controlled by Min Zhuo. His true body was hidden further away, a lotus leaf concealing him as he silently observed the movements of the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators.</p><p>The lotus leaf was emerald green, large as a fan, capable of concealing both his form and aura.</p><p>After numerous encounters, Min Zhuo knew Qin Sang possessed a profound detection method and had thus taken double precautions.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Qin Sang hadn't brought the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.  The upcoming confrontation was likely the most crucial battle, and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly needed to remain to assist his true body.</p><p>Both Min Zhuo and Qin Sang were searching for each other, yet neither could detect the other's presence. Consequently, neither would act rashly.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The Tainted Qi receded further.</p><p>Min Zhuo received a talisman message.</p><p>After reading its contents, Min Zhuo let out a long sigh of relief, a triumphant smile appearing on his face. “They’ve finally made their move!  Fortunately, I haven't missed this opportune moment!”</p><p>The message stated that after this period of recuperation, King Lu had issued a decree, preparing to deploy troops once more.  Moreover, this time, all divisions were mobilized, the scale grander than any previous campaign!</p><p>Min Zhuo had been waiting for this day. The prior lack of news had made him somewhat anxious. He had risked great danger, presiding over the formation’s core, partly to create an escape opportunity for himself, and partly to use himself as bait, further pushing the war forward.</p><p>The facts proved he had succeeded.  With King Lu launching a fierce attack, all the Tempest Realm experts would be tied down on the battlefield.</p><p>However, he still didn’t reveal himself.  Putting away the talisman message, he looked towards the depths of the Tainted Lands, calculated the time, and thought, “The Azure Spirit Qi should be about to emerge.”</p><p>Two more days passed.  The Tainted Qi continued to recede, the deep seawater appearing even more profound, as if an abyss lay below, bottomless.</p><p>Confirming the absence of monstrous beast auras, the Tenth Elder led the clan experts, slowly approaching the edge of the Tainted Qi.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace cultivators also cautiously moved towards that location.</p><p>On the evening of the next day, Qin Sang, who had been silently searching for Min Zhuo, narrowed his eyes and abruptly turned towards the River of Calamity.</p><p>Amidst the churning grey-white mist, a glimmer of azure light flashed between two streams of fog.</p><p>The azure light was faint and fleeting, but incredibly conspicuous within the Tainted Qi.  Like a small, nimble spirit fish, its azure scales shimmering with pure radiance, it swam within the Tainted Qi with exceptional agility.</p><p>“The Azure Spirit Qi has emerged!”</p><p>The Chang You Clan experts stirred, greed flashing in their eyes.</p><p>“Min Ying, Old Seven…”</p><p>The Tenth Elder, his expression vigilant, glanced around and quickly called out several names. “Go and capture that strand of Azure Spirit Qi.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Several individuals immediately stepped forward, rushing into the Tainted Qi like hungry tigers pouncing on their prey.</p><p>The Azure Spirit Qi was agile and elusive, constantly changing direction. It was a mystical breath, impervious to ordinary sealing techniques, and its speed was extraordinary, impossible for divine sense to lock onto.  One careless moment could lead to losing its trail.</p><p>However, over the years, they had developed a set of effective collection methods.</p><p>They quickly surrounded the Azure Spirit Qi. One of them produced a jade bottle, its mouth aimed at the Azure Spirit Qi. The others formed a formation, cooperating to execute a restraining technique.</p><p>A faint white light shimmered around the mouth of the jade bottle. A suction force erupted, enveloping the Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>The Azure Spirit Qi swayed violently, but couldn't escape the suction, gradually being drawn closer until finally being sucked into the jade bottle.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>The cultivator immediately sealed the bottle, still not daring to be careless, swiftly executing a series of hand seals.</p><p>Soon, the violently shaking jade bottle stabilized completely, its body emitting a green light like the purest jade. A hair-thin strand of azure qi could be seen swirling within the bottle.</p><p>They searched again but didn't find any other Azure Spirit Qi. They weren’t worried; the appearance of Azure Spirit Qi was unpredictable. Sometimes a single strand would appear after a long interval, while other times, over a dozen would emerge at once, leaving them scrambling.</p><p>The Tenth Elder and the others then caught up.</p><p>"A strand of Azure Spirit Qi appeared so quickly! This is surely a bountiful harvest," the cultivator holding the jade bottle said excitedly.</p><p>“It seems those outsiders don’t dare to compete with us. In any case, the harvest will be greater than before,” someone sneered.</p><p>The cultivator holding the jade bottle's expression turned serious. “Have you discovered their traces?”</p><p>The Tenth Elder nodded. "The outsiders have only sent a few experts.  They only dare to observe from afar.  We'll deal with them later.  Let's move deeper!"</p><p>The group immediately advanced further into the Tainted Qi.</p><p>Outside, the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators dared not confront the enemy directly. They could only watch helplessly as the first strand of Azure Spirit Qi was taken.  After waiting for a period, they cautiously approached.</p><p>Far away, Qin Sang observed everything.</p><p>His gaze passed over the Chang You Clan cultivators, focusing on the source of the Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>When the first strand of Azure Spirit Qi appeared, he sensed a peculiar fluctuation.  The Tainted Qi had clearly trembled.</p><p>The tremor originated from the very place he had once tried to enter, but ultimately retreated from.</p><p>Logically, with the River of Calamity receding, the Tainted Qi in that area should have thinned, yet that particular spot showed no obvious change, remaining as dark as before, like a concentrated, unchanging dark cloud.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang perceived that with the receding Tainted Qi, the power that had once unnerved him, the power he had been so wary of, was gradually weakening.</p><p>This weakening was a natural occurrence, not one that would provoke backlash. Once it weakened to a certain extent, the threat to intruders would greatly diminish, effectively opening its doors to outsiders.</p><p>Of course, this was only from the perspective of Void Refinement cultivators. In the eyes of Nascent Soul cultivators, that place remained extremely dangerous.  The Chang You Clan experts didn’t dare to approach too closely, only guarding the perimeter, waiting for the Azure Spirit Qi to drift out on its own.  With each tremor, they would retreat, avoiding the impact of the shockwaves.</p><p>After a while, with another tremor, more azure light flickered into existence.</p><p>The Tenth Elder and the others reacted swiftly, capturing this strand of Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>As time passed, the tremors became more frequent, and strands of Azure Spirit Qi drifted out intermittently. The vast majority fell into the hands of the Chang You Clan.</p><p>Until a sudden, violent tremor caused several azure lights to flash simultaneously. Although the Tenth Elder and his group were quick, one strand escaped their grasp.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace cultivators, who had previously been forced to watch with envious eyes, immediately seized this opportunity and captured it.</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>A Chang You Clan member roared furiously, about to attack, but was stopped by the Tenth Elder.</p><p>“Collecting the Azure Spirit Qi takes priority. We'll settle the score with them later!” the Tenth Elder said coldly.</p><p>Thus, a precarious peace was maintained, with more and more Azure Spirit Qi drifting out, the majority being collected by the Chang You Clan.</p><p>Beyond the River of Calamity.</p><p>Min Zhuo was silently counting the frequency of the tremors, seemingly calculating something, still hesitant to act.</p><p>It wasn’t excessive caution. Although he had the wax figure to bear his injuries, engaging in combat with powerful enemies and sustaining further wounds would accelerate the burning of the wax figure. He had to be careful, avoiding such a perilous situation.</p><p>After waiting for so long without any unusual activity, and knowing that collecting Mount Daiyu would also require time, Min Zhuo knew it was time to move.</p><p>He quietly left his hiding place, concealed by the lotus leaf, and approached the source of the Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>Shortly after he entered the Tainted Qi, Qin Sang's heart stirred, sensing something amiss.</p><p>Then, Min Zhuo reached the source of the Azure Spirit Qi. Taking advantage of a burst of tremors, he flashed inside without alerting anyone.</p><p>Not long after, Qin Sang arrived silently.</p><p>Gazing at the spot where Min Zhuo had vanished, the Vermillion Bird Dharma Idol’s eyes gleamed. This had been a test of patience, and he had clearly won.</p><p>However, who the final victor would be remained unknown.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, the Vermillion Bird Dharma Idol also dove in.</p><p>…</p><p>Western Lands.</p><p>King Lu’s Palanquin.</p><p>After speaking with the Grand Preceptor, the Junior Preceptor had remained in secluded cultivation within the palanquin, never leaving.</p><p>On this day, King Lu, the Grand Preceptor, and numerous other experts all emerged from seclusion. A great battle was to take place tonight.</p><p>Atop a green mountain beside the palanquin, Yuan Miao stood, filled with apprehension.</p><p>That Qin Sang and the Tempest Realm had managed to hold out for so long, even trading blows with King Lu, was truly beyond his expectations.  However, he knew full well that King Lu's side hadn't deployed their full strength.</p><p>In this battle, the Grand Preceptor would personally participate.  The outcome was uncertain.</p><p>Before the palanquin, dark clouds obscured the sky. The army teemed like ants, each division arrayed in formation, their fighting spirit soaring.  Lord Mo Shan, Shi Mu, and the others paid their respects to King Lu before dispersing into their respective formations, practicing their maneuvers.</p><p>Within the Clear Pool, Lu Gan’s expression was serious.  The techniques of the Yellow Scroll of the Profound Earth had been exposed once. The upcoming battle would also be a test for him.</p><p>Before the palanquin, the Grand Preceptor and the Junior Preceptor stood on either side of King Lu.</p><p>Once the army had assembled, the Grand Preceptor bowed respectfully.  “The hour has come. I take my leave.”</p><p>“May the Grand Preceptor vanquish the enemy and return victorious. I await your good news!” King Lu declared solemnly.</p><p>Spiritual light appeared on the Grand Preceptor’s brow, descending to the ground and transforming into a nine-colored spirit deer.</p><p>It appeared to be merely a fawn, with small antlers and large, blinking eyes, lively and adorable. It was difficult to imagine that the Grand Preceptor’s spirit beast would have such an appearance.</p><p>The spirit deer stretched, lay down on the grass, tucked its head into its chest, and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>“I ask Your Majesty to look after my companion beast,” the Grand Preceptor said.</p><p>“Rest assured, Grand Preceptor,” King Lu said, subtly positioning himself between the spirit deer and the Junior Preceptor.</p><p>The Junior Preceptor said meaningfully, “I wonder what kind of companion beast this spirit deer is. I’ve never heard of it. The Grand Preceptor truly has profound reserves!  However, I didn’t expect that even with the Grand Preceptor’s strength, you would be so cautious. It’s a pity I won't witness the splendor of the Grand Preceptor’s full power!”</p><p>“Caution is never amiss.”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor said indifferently. His figure flickered, appearing at the front of the formation. He gazed deeply at the battlefield in the distance and roared like thunder.</p><p>“Advance!”</p><p>…</p><p>Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang sat upon the Spirit Altar.  The moment King Lu deployed his troops, a warning message arrived.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang’s eyes snapped open, radiating brilliant light.</p><p>“The time has come…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.  His fingers twitched slightly, and the Thunder Altar beneath him rumbled, the sound echoing throughout the protective formation around the temple.</p><p>He raised his hands, executing a hand seal.  The thunder intensified. As he performed more hand seals, the Thunder Altar blazed with dazzling lightning, bathing the Azure Goat Temple in a silvery-white light, blinding to the naked eye.</p><p>Within the Thunder Altar, azure light flashed, revealing a sheet of azure ‘thunder paper’ – the Oath of Thunder, forged from the Vermillion Bird True Thunder!</p><p>The Oath of Thunder slowly rotated, initially ethereal and unstable, gradually solidifying.</p><p>Throughout this process, Qin Sang’s expression remained unchanged.  However, outside the main altar, presiding over the three core branch altars, Su Nu, Vermillion Bird, and Si Lu all felt immense pressure.</p><p>Accompanying the pressure was excitement.  During this period, they had witnessed the Thunder Altar's power, but they knew Qin Sang hadn't unleashed its full potential, that he was still holding back.</p><p>Finally, they would witness the true might of the Thunder Altar!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's will transmitted to them.  Without hesitation, the three immediately entered a meditative trance, obeying Qin Sang’s will, silently chanting incantations, activating the power of the Spirit Altars.  The decree passed through the altar formation, layer by layer.</p>
