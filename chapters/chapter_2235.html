<h1>Chapter 2225: Star Soul</h1><p>Qin Sang followed Master Tong Shen’s pointing finger, seeing only a faint mist.  Knowing it was a concealing formation, she complained, “Master, you’re tricking me again! There’s no mountain there!”</p><p>Master Tong Shen laughed heartily, tapping his cane in the air. “Isn’t the mountain right there?”</p><p>A mountain suddenly appeared from the mist.  It wasn’t high, but from a distance, waterfalls cascaded down its lush slopes, a truly beautiful sight. Several palaces were nestled amongst the trees, creating a serene atmosphere.</p><p>Master Tong Shen opened the formation, leading Qin Sang into a palace. The interior was sparsely furnished, with only a prayer altar, incense, a few cushions, and a spirit tablet inscribed with the name “Ancestor Yuan Jing.”</p><p>“Our sect is not a renowned school. I was fortunate enough to inherit a lineage from Mount Yuan Jing. I don't know its origins or the ancestor's name, so I placed this tablet, using 'Yuan Jing' as the name. Once you've paid your respects, you’ll officially be a disciple.”</p><p>Master Tong Shen had Qin Sang pay her respects to the ancestor tablet. After three bows and nine prostrations, she became a disciple of Mount Yuan Jing.</p><p>Master Tong Shen mentioned that besides Qin Sang, he had two other disciples, a male and a female, making their sect a total of four people.</p><p>“Your senior brother isn’t on the mountain, and your senior sister is in seclusion. You can visit them later. Your brother's dharma name is Qing Yan, and your sister's is Qing Hong. What dharma name would you like?” Master Tong Shen asked, smiling kindly.</p><p>Normally, the master chooses the dharma name, but Master Tong Shen, exceptionally fond of his new disciple, let Qin Sang decide.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang said, “Master, I’ve always dreamed of being as free as the wind. Can I be called Qing Feng?”</p><p>“Qing Feng…”</p><p>Master Tong Shen frowned, slightly regretting letting Qin Sang choose, but as a master, he couldn’t go back on his word. He nodded. “Very well, you shall be called Qing Feng from now on.”</p><p>Then, Master Tong Shen introduced the sect’s teachings.</p><p>“Mount Yuan Jing has three lineages:  the *玄冥变* , which allows control over rivers and lakes, and the ability to exhale clouds and breathe out rain; the *云苍十二雷诀* , twelve thunder techniques that can conjure countless thunderbolts; and the *清露还丹诀* , which combines alchemy with internal cultivation for exceptional results. Which lineage do you wish to choose?”</p><p>Normally, Qin Sang, having just sensed the spiritual energy, wouldn't choose so soon.  However, Mount Yuan Jing’s techniques were unique; all three lineages shared the same initial cultivation method, but with subtle differences leading to distinct paths, making an early choice crucial.</p><p>Qin Sang understood all three lineages were related to water.  She guessed the *Yun Cang Twelve Thunder Techniques* likely involved water-based thunder.</p><p>She learned that her senior brother practiced the *Yun Cang Twelve Thunder Techniques*, her senior sister the *Xuan Ming Transformation*, and even Master Tong Shen himself cultivated thunder techniques.</p><p>Master Tong Shen naturally hoped Qin Sang would choose the *Yun Cang Twelve Thunder Techniques*, allowing both he and his eldest disciple to guide her.  Plus, the thunder techniques sounded powerful, something a young person might find irresistible.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang chose the *Qing Lu Return Elixir Technique*.</p><p>“You want to learn alchemy?”</p><p>Master Tong Shen’s frown deepened.  He realized Qin Sang might not be as docile as she seemed. Since taking her on, he felt he'd gained a few more wrinkles.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded firmly.  “Master said the *Qing Lu Return Elixir Technique* allows for cultivation through elixir consumption. I want to help Master as soon as possible!”</p><p>This was a carefully considered decision.  With her understanding of thunder techniques, mastering the *Yun Cang Twelve Thunder Techniques* would be quick, but she found that too slow!</p><p>Learning the *Qing Lu Return Elixir Technique* would allow her to study alchemy and create elixirs, thus boosting her cultivation externally.</p><p>Ordinary alchemists consumed elixirs cautiously, following strict procedures to avoid accumulating toxins.  Failing to maintain a balanced cultivation could even lead to demonic possession.</p><p>Qin Sang was different.  She lacked only cultivation; consuming elixirs like meals wouldn't be a problem.</p><p>And Qin Sang wouldn't be making normal elixirs—she’d be making poison pills!</p><p>Despite losing her poison pearl, with the right antidotes, she could use the *Poison God Canon* to rapidly increase her cultivation.</p><p>Master Tongshen opened his mouth, wanting to say he didn't need his disciple's help, but fearing to dampen his enthusiasm, he said, "Choosing a successor isn't urgent.  Focus on comprehending the cultivation technique I just gave you…"</p><p>He also practiced alchemy from the *Qinglu Huandan Jue*, but it wasn't his primary technique. He was afraid of leading such a promising disciple astray, a mistake he would deeply regret.</p><p>Just then, Master Tongshen looked towards the hall's entrance, smiling slightly.  "Daoist Lu has arrived.  Disciple, get up and join me in greeting Senior Lu."</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed Master Tongshen to a pavilion in the mountains, where a scholar in green robes stood admiring the scenery.</p><p>"Daoist Lu, you've arrived quickly!"</p><p>Master Tongshen bowed from a distance.</p><p>The scholar turned, revealing a slender elder with a topknot and long beard flowing to his chest, gently stirred by the mountain breeze, giving him an air of ethereal grace. This was Master Tongshen's friend, known as Mr. Lu.</p><p>"Daoist Tongshen summoned me, how could I delay?"</p><p>Mr. Lu smiled, noticing Qin Sang and studying him. "This young man is remarkably handsome. I haven't seen him before. Is he a new disciple?"</p><p>"Indeed," Master Tongshen said with a beaming smile, affecting a stern demeanor. "Disciple, greet your senior."</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward, bowing respectfully. "Junior Qingfeng greets Senior Lu!"</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's monastic name, Master Tongshen inwardly sighed with regret.</p><p>Fortunately, Mr. Lu showed no unusual reaction. Stroking his beard, he smiled. "A fine young man!  Let me give you a small gift to mark our meeting.  Remember to follow your master's teachings and cultivate diligently."</p><p>Mr. Lu presented Qin Sang with a jade ruyi.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Master Tongshen, who nodded, allowing him to accept the gift, much to Master Tongshen’s satisfaction.</p><p>Noticing Master Tongshen's expression, Mr. Lu transmitted a voice message, "You weren't this happy when you took in Qingyan and Qinghong. What's so special about this new disciple?"</p><p>Master Tongshen smiled without answering.</p><p>Mr. Lu sighed, changing the subject. "You summoned me urgently, what's the matter?"</p><p>Master Tongshen chuckled. "I found three fine vats of excellent wine on my recent travels. Isn't that worth a visit from you?"</p><p>"Excellent wine from the mortal world?"</p><p>Mr. Lu's eyes lit up.  "Wonderful! Wonderful! Where is it? Let's have it now!"</p><p>"It's in my room, with fine food prepared. Please, come in."</p><p>"Please."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised that his master and Mr. Lu were both wine enthusiasts. Seeing his master gesture for him to follow, he went to a pavilion.</p><p>However, upon entering and closing the door, both men's smiles vanished, replaced by serious expressions.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled by the change. The room's windows and doors were shut, and a faint spiritual light suggested a protective formation to isolate the interior.</p><p>The "excellent wine" was likely a code, but Qin Sang wondered why Master Tongshen was so cautious within the mountain gates.</p><p>Mr. Lu looked at Qin Sang and said to Master Tongshen, "Have you encountered trouble, Daoist?"</p><p>"Something has come up, but it's not a problem yet."</p><p>Master Tongshen gestured for Mr. Lu to sit, then asked, "Have you noticed any unusual happenings in the mortal realm recently, or received any strange news?"</p><p>Mr. Lu shook his head. "Please be frank."</p><p>Master Tongshen relayed his experiences in Fengcheng and his speculations to Mr. Lu.</p><p>"The young Golden Eagle King is pursuing human cultivators, posting their images in the mortal world?" Mr. Lu was astonished.</p><p>"Yes, I suspect a few cultivators were injured while escaping and were forced to hide among mortals," Master Tongshen said.</p><p>Mr. Lu pondered. "Do you intend to save them?"</p><p>Master Tongshen didn't directly answer.  "If they are human cultivators, they may have been hunted for resisting oppression. Saving them would preserve our strength. Also, I worry that if the Golden Eagles can't find them, they'll slaughter mortals to flush them out!"</p><p>Master Tongshen continued, "Of course, we don't know them, so we can't act rashly. We must investigate before making plans. You have many connections. Could you discreetly inquire with the Golden Eagles to find out about these cultivators?"</p><p>"That's easily done!"</p><p>Mr. Lu immediately prepared to leave.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Master Tongshen stopped him, producing a wine jar. "The wine is here, why not have a drink before you go? Disciple, pour the wine for us!"</p><p>With fine wine and food, the two enjoyed themselves.</p><p>Before his departure, Master Tongshen instructed, "Fellow Daoist Lu, please be extremely cautious when gathering information.  If you arouse the suspicion of the Golden Eagle Clan, it could be very dangerous for you."</p><p>"Master, don't worry. I understand the risks. Farewell!"</p><p>Master Lu bowed and left.</p><p>After Master Lu departed, Master Tongshen summoned Qin Sang to his private chamber and thoroughly explained the cultivation techniques. Qin Sang grasped them quickly, and that very night he began his true cultivation.</p><p>After a night's practice, Qin Sang felt light and invigorated, his ailments completely vanished. Master Tongshen, after examining Qin Sang's progress, was overjoyed.</p><p>From that day forward, Qin Sang became a disciple of Mount Yuanjing and settled there.</p><p>Master Tongshen grew increasingly pleased with his disciple.  Qin Sang was not only exceptionally talented but also diligently cultivated, spending all but necessary rest in secluded practice, never showing the slightest slackness.  The only thing that troubled Master Tongshen was Qin Sang's firm determination to cultivate the *Clear Dew Returning Elixir Scripture*.</p><p>A few days later, Master Lu returned.</p><p>Master Tongshen received Master Lu in the same tower as before, and summoned Qin Sang to pour wine.</p><p>Just before entering the tower, Qin Sang looked up at the sky.</p><p>As evening approached, dark clouds gathered, with the moonlight faintly piercing the gaps in the clouds, while the starlight was obscured and barely visible.</p><p>Now Qin Sang understood why Master Tongshen and Master Lu were so cautious, always choosing this tower, thick with powerful formations, for their important discussions.</p><p>It had to do with the妖族  cultivation methods.</p><p>The first realm of ancient妖修  was called the Spiritual Enlightenment Realm. Master Tongshen and Master Lu sometimes referred to it as the Spirit-妖 Realm.</p><p>As the name suggests, cultivators in this realm transitioned from ignorant beasts to intelligent beings, gradually becoming enlightened and ultimately spiritual cultivators.  The cultivation process was largely similar to later eras, although later eras divided it into more stages.</p><p>Above the Spiritual Enlightenment Realm was the Transformation Realm, similar to later stages.  However, ancient妖修  despised humans and generally didn't transform into human form willingly.  Even if they did, it was to imitate deities, unlike later beliefs that humans are the spiritual apex, and妖修  deliberately imitated humans.</p><p>The term "Transformation" meant that cultivators in this realm, by consuming the Emperor's Flowing Essence, achieved complete enlightenment, and their beastly forms were no longer limiting. They could change their forms at will.</p><p>Beyond the Transformation Realm, unlike later eras, instead of the Divine Transformation stage, it was directly called the Dharma Image Realm.</p><p>Based on their conversation, Qin Sang deduced that the Divine Transformation stage was likely incorporated into the Transformation and Dharma Image Realms.  The peak of the Dharma Image Realm corresponded to the peak of the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>This shows that in ancient times, the division of major realms was based on easily observable characteristics, making them more intuitive but less even. The strength difference between cultivators of the same realm could be vast, unlike the more gradual progression of later eras.</p><p>Above the Dharma Image Realm was the Star Soul Realm, which Master Tongshen called "妖 Soul Entrusting Stars".</p><p>Hearing the name, Qin Sang was startled, and many of his previous doubts were immediately resolved!</p><p>Star Soul Realm cultivators could entrust their妖魂  to the stars.</p><p>As long as the starlight endured, and the Star Soul remained, even if their physical bodies were destroyed, they could be reborn—virtually immortal, worthy of being called saints.</p><p>At night, countless stars filled the sky. Some light came from stars, while others might be妖 stars!</p><p>Starlight shone upon the earth, as if everything happening on earth was visible to the Star Soul Realm cultivators; no secrets could escape their eyes.</p><p>Of course, these powerful cultivators couldn't possibly monitor everything, but Master Tongshen and Master Lu, as humans, naturally felt uneasy and sought to avoid detection.</p><p>Beyond this, there was a remarkable effect: those with bloodline descendants bathed in the light of妖 stars would gradually, over time, see their talents and aptitudes improve, even undergo mutation. Powerful妖族  cultivators could even cause the entire race's bloodline to transform, resulting in powerful innate abilities that would become ingrained in their bloodline and passed down through generations.</p><p>Therefore, once a top cultivator emerged within a clan, the entire clan would benefit, undergoing a bloodline elevation!</p><p>This might be one source of the妖族 's innate talents.</p><p>*Heavenly妖 Refining Form* clearly followed this path, stemming from the ancient妖修  Dao!</p><p>For reasons unknown to later generations, the妖族  abandoned the path of "妖 Soul Entrusting Stars"—at least, Qin Sang hadn't heard of "妖 stars" in Great Zhou.</p><p>妖 Soul Entrusting Stars;妖 stars scattered across the galaxy, high above, looking down upon the earth like gods.</p><p>Could this be the truth behind the妖 Court?</p><p>Qin Sang had long wondered why, despite the dominance of humanity, many star names used妖族  names, such as the Four Symbols and Twenty-Eight Mansions, and even the Celestial Court's Department of Warfare's star officials followed this convention.</p><p>The answer lay here!</p>
