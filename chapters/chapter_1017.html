<h1>Chapter 109: Third Entry into the Seven Kills Palace</h1><p>Qin Sang trailed behind the group, communicating with Bai An in secret.</p><p>Soon, they arrived near the storm belt.</p><p>The cultivators present were all quite powerful.  Without hesitation, they charged into the storm. Qin Sang summoned his sword aura for protection, his figure flashing as he entered the tempest.</p><p>Having been forced deep into the storm belt before, Qin Sang was now well-versed in navigating the hurricanes.</p><p>He moved freely within the storm, his speed second only to the Nascent Soul cultivators. He was among the first to reach the Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>Seeing the Seven Kills Palace’s immortal formation again, Qin Sang witnessed a completely different scene.</p><p>Previously, the formation's power was stable, like a gray wind wall, its might not outwardly apparent.</p><p>Now, as the Seven Kills Palace emerged, impacting the formation, the wind wall had shattered. The formation resembled the eye of the storm, with violent winds sweeping in all directions. Spirit tides surged, and terrifying waves raged, possessing the momentum to tear apart everything.</p><p>Its power surpassed even the most violent spirit tides deep within the storm belt.</p><p>Qin Sang stood far away at the periphery, yet he could still clearly feel the incredibly violent power of the formation. It was hard to imagine what dangers lay within.</p><p>Entering the Seven Kills Palace required courage.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang noticed a faint red glow at the very center of the formation, like the rosy hues of dawn rising from the seabed.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred. He recalled the crimson immortal restrictions within the inner palace of the Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>He suspected that the source of the rosy glow was likely the manifestation of these restrictions.</p><p>"Is the Seven Kills Palace about to emerge?"</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head slightly, gazing at the glow.</p><p>Ahead of him, two Nascent Soul ancestors stood motionless at the edge of the formation, seemingly waiting for the opportune moment.  He patiently waited as well, not rushing to enter the formation.</p><p>Time ticked by slowly.</p><p>The glow ascended incredibly slowly.</p><p>Qin Sang silently counted the time. It took a full seven or eight hours for the glow to finally rise from the seabed to a level where he could see it directly.  Then, it almost stopped.</p><p>Just then, the Nascent Soul cultivators in front suddenly moved.</p><p>One summoned a flying sword, the spirit sword revolving around him, also shielding the two disciples beside him. He executed an exceptionally complex sword art, transforming into a sharp beam of sword light that vanished into the formation in a flash.</p><p>The other cultivator manifested a suit of dark armor, gently taking a step forward, entering the formation alone, seemingly detached from the mortal world.</p><p>In other directions, the other Nascent Soul cultivators also moved simultaneously.</p><p>After the two Nascent Soul cultivators left, Qin Sang flashed to the edge of the formation.</p><p>Feeling the power of the formation up close, a grave expression appeared in Qin Sang’s eyes. After a moment of contemplation, his aura suddenly shifted, and wings materialized behind his back as he executed the Heavenly Demon Transformation.</p><p>Then, he swept his divine sense across the Thousand Treasures Ring. The Celestial Corpse Coffin flew out, transforming into a suit of armor that completely enveloped him.</p><p>Having made these preparations, Qin Sang summoned the Ebony Sword. Feeling confident, he lightly tapped the spirit sword, conjuring a spinning sword wheel to clear the path, and flashed into the formation.</p><p>Not long after Qin Sang left, two streaks of light flew over, landing at the same spot.</p><p>"Senior Brother, did you see that? The person just now seems extraordinary, possessing remarkably high swordsmanship."</p><p>One of the young men narrowed his eyes, staring intently in the direction where Qin Sang had disappeared.</p><p>He too was dedicated to the way of the sword. Having sensed the fluctuation of sword Qi, his interest was piqued. He immediately changed his mind and rushed over, but he was still a step too late, missing the person he was after.</p><p>The other person said, "Anyone daring to enter the Seven Kills Palace alone is no ordinary person. We should also depart, lest we miss the opportunity. Remember, if you feel overwhelmed, retreat immediately. Don't force it. If we get separated in the formation, meet at the Heavenly Tower."</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>Before the words faded, the two entered the formation side by side.</p><p>Similar scenes played out one after another.</p><p>Unaware of the small interlude outside, Qin Sang was fully focused on dealing with the onslaught within the formation.</p><p>After entering, he felt like a small boat caught in a stormy sea, adrift and helpless. Without the jade talisman’s protection, he had to be extremely cautious every moment. One wrong move could cost him his life.</p><p>He cleared his mind, using the sword wheel to cut a path through the raging forces.</p><p>Thanks to his escape technique, far surpassing that of cultivators at the same level, he was able to dodge every impending danger in time. This conserved much more energy than directly resisting the forces.</p><p>As he ventured deeper, the formation's power became increasingly chaotic and dense, leaving less room to maneuver. At the same time, Qin Sang felt an intangible pressure descend upon him, causing his true essence to stagnate slightly, which alarmed him.</p><p>Qin Sang could only fully empower the Ebony Sword, sparing no true essence, to carve a path forward.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the Nascent Soul cultivators faced even greater pressure.</p><p>Especially those who needed to divert their attention to protect their disciples were actually slower than Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Rumble… Boom…’</p><p>Roaring sounds filled his ears. Qin Sang, unsure how much longer it would take to traverse the formation, kept his head down and pressed forward.</p><p>Before long, the surrounding pressure suddenly vanished. Qin Sang's heart stirred.  He urged the Ebony Sword forward, slashing out. Finally, he saw what appeared to be the interior of the Seven Kills Palace!</p><p>Confirming there was no danger, Qin Sang flashed inside.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>Qin Sang landed, glancing around, a look of surprise on his face. "I didn't emerge from the wasteland. This... seems close to the Flower Fairy Lake?"</p><p>He looked up, realizing that the entire sky above the outer palace of the Seven Kills Palace was covered in dense clouds, a scene of utter chaos.</p><p>"Before, it was like forcibly opening an entrance to the formation with external force, and that wasteland was probably the weakest point of the formation. Now, with the Seven Kills Palace emerging and shaking the outer formation, the entire outer palace can be considered the gate. So wherever one enters, one will end up there, and the same applies when leaving…"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, figuring out the reason.</p><p>He wasn't afraid of being blocked at the exit, but accidentally falling into ancient restrictions or perilous places like the Flower Fairy Lake would be dangerous.</p><p>He concealed himself, making sure there were no other cultivators around. He then flashed to the spot with the widest view and looked towards the depths of the Seven Kills Palace, observing the inner palace.</p><p>The Heavenly Tower stood tall and clearly visible.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed intently.</p><p>The cloud and mist immortal restrictions covering the inner palace looked like flowing fire from afar, yet also resembled flowing liquid glass, radiant and dazzling.</p><p>At this moment, a gap appeared.</p><p>According to Ning Wu Hui, that was the entrance to the inner palace of the Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>A strong sense of familiarity arose spontaneously.  Qin Sang immediately summoned his flying light, heading towards that direction.  Only when he saw the scene clearly did he finally understand the source of this familiarity.</p><p>At the same time, he understood why this secret realm was called the Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>At the entrance to the immortal restriction stood an ancient palace.</p><p>Above the palace hung a plaque with three characters inscribed on it: Seven Kills Palace!</p><p>And the handwriting of these three characters clearly originated from the same source as the 'Zi Wei Palace' on the Heavenly Gate of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield!</p>
