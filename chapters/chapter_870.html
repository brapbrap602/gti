<h1>Chapter 862: The Bitter Cold and Gale Formation</h1><p>In the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others hovered above the sea, their expressions solemn as they stared towards the island.  They had seen the specter of the Kui Dragon and felt the immense demonic pressure, putting everyone on high alert.</p><p>Splashes erupted on the sea surface as a streak of black light shot towards them, landing in Chu Hengâ€™s palm. Everyone's heart tightened as they looked over.</p><p>Chu Heng nodded slightly. "This demon is indeed the Kui Dragon.  Attack!"</p><p>Before his voice faded, everyone, carrying a crystal stele, used their movement techniques to close in on the island.</p><p>During their flight, the Fang youth had already engaged the Kui Dragon.</p><p>Wind and rain intensified!</p><p>Mid-air, a golden light intertwined with the Kui Dragon.  With each breath, the dragon emitted shimmering silver light. It even manipulated the lightning descending from the sky, directing it towards the golden light.</p><p>The battle between man and beast was fierce, and it was difficult to discern who had the upper hand.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others held their breath and quietly landed on the island, selecting an open area.</p><p>Not far above them, the Fang youth and the Kui Dragon fought intensely.  He wielded a golden whip, striking the Kui Dragon to distract it.</p><p>The Fang youth was powerful.</p><p>Although the golden whip couldn't penetrate the dragon's scales, each strike inflicted significant pain.</p><p>The Kui Dragon's ferocity was ignited. It spewed thunder, repeatedly deflecting the golden whip. Despite its enormous size, it moved with astonishing agility, its long tail flashing with electric light like a giant silver sword, forcing the Fang youth to retreat.</p><p>"So strong!"</p><p>Everyone looked up, awestruck by the Kui Dragon's power.</p><p>This great demon's bloodline was undoubtedly potent, its strength far exceeding ordinary demonic beasts. Without the Bitter Cold and Gale Formation, they likely wouldn't be able to subdue it.</p><p>"Quickly, set up the formation!" Chu Heng commanded.</p><p>At this moment, the Fang youth was retreating towards their location.  He wasn't entirely unable to withstand the Kui Dragon; he was intentionally leading it towards them.</p><p>Everyone acted swiftly, setting up the grand formation before the Kui Dragon arrived.</p><p>*Swish, swish, swish...*</p><p>The crystal steles landed, instantly sinking into the ground and disappearing.</p><p>The group positioned themselves hundreds of meters apart, forming a large circle.  After the steles vanished, cold energy diffused underground, turning the roots of the plants within the circle bluish-green. However, nothing unusual was visible from the surface.</p><p>Cold energy accumulated deep underground, concealed and dormant.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others concealed themselves, awaiting the opportune moment.</p><p>"It's coming!"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the two rapidly approaching figures and saw the true form of the Kui Dragon.  This demonic beast differed from the legendary divine beast Kui Dragon.  It resembled a long serpent with a single leg.</p><p>Its scales were like those of a fish, while its head resembled a turtle's.</p><p>The demon's bloodline was mixed, a peculiar combination of features.  However, its ability to control lightning was extraordinary, a power derived from the Kui Dragon bloodline.</p><p>The Kui Dragon roared repeatedly, bolts of lightning chasing the Fang youth as if controlled by the dragon itself.  The thunderballs it spat were even more terrifying. When one struck a mountain peak, the summit was instantly flattened.</p><p>The two figures chased each other, finally arriving above the formation.</p><p>As the Fang youth flew over the area, his speed suddenly surged. He accelerated and ascended. The Kui Dragon, in hot pursuit, plunged into the trap, completely unaware.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The ground exploded, sending debris flying amidst the wind and rain.</p><p>Then, *bang, bang, bang* sounds echoed as the five crystal steles rose from the earth, emitting a bright blue light. A surge of cold energy erupted from the ground, spreading rapidly, forming a cage of icy air.</p><p>The cage was square, perfectly trapping the Kui Dragon.</p><p>Inside, the bitter wind howled, like chains lashing at the dragon.</p><p>The steles stood tall, continuously emitting cold energy that flowed into the cage.  Qin Sang and the others had already reappeared, each seated atop a stele, channeling their energy into the formation.</p><p>Seeing this, the Fang youth halted his escape and flew back, his face filled with delight.  He looked at the Kui Dragon trapped within the icy cage and laughed.</p><p>The Kui Dragon, possessing considerable intelligence, immediately understood its predicament and let out a piercing shriek.</p><p>The shriek was incredibly jarring, causing Qin Sang and the others to frown. The dark clouds above seemed to be dispersed, churning restlessly.</p><p>The trapped Kui Dragon went berserk.</p><p>It seemed to be clad in lightning armor, each scale shimmering with silver light and emitting tiny sparks of electricity.  The icy winds, bombarded by the lightning, scattered, unable to restrain the dragon.</p><p>Chaos erupted within the cage.</p><p>Cold air clashed with lightning, creating a chaotic scene. The Kui Dragon's roars resonated, followed by deafening thunder.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A thunderball slammed into the cage.</p><p>The cage shook violently, and Qin Sang and the others paled slightly, inwardly shocked.  They dared not slacken, pouring their true essence into the steles to reinforce the cage.</p><p>But before the cage could stabilize, the Kui Dragon's tail lashed out, even more powerful than its thunderballs, nearly tearing a hole in the cage.</p><p>This was the moment of the cage's formation, its most vulnerable state.  Under the Kui Dragon's frantic attacks, it began to weaken. Maintaining the cage itself was a struggle, let alone manipulating the other aspects of the spirit formation.</p><p>Sensing the cage's instability and the prospect of escape, the Kui Dragon became even more frenzied.</p><p>Its roars carried a strange rhythm, drawing upon the lightning energy in the sky. The dark clouds churned as lightning converged above them.</p><p>Seeing this, the Fang youth's expression turned grim.  He shouted urgently, "Increase your true essence! Don't let that beast escape!"</p><p>As he yelled, he hastily summoned his golden whip, which shot into the air.  The whip snapped, striking the sky and dispersing the gathering lightning.</p><p>Everyone knew this was the critical moment.  Ignoring everything else, they poured their true essence into the formation.</p><p>The steles glowed brilliantly.</p><p>Cold air gushed out, the temperature plummeting.  The surrounding environment was affected; trees became coated in frost and died.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. He felt his true essence depleting rapidly.  The Kui Dragon was stronger than they had anticipated.  Trapping it wasn't the end; they had to hold it until the Fang youth could kill it.</p><p>If his true essence was exhausted, any small mishap could cost him his life.  Looking at the others, he saw their solemn expressions.  They were forced by the situation to push themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then silently unsealed his Corpse Pill, drawing upon its energy instead.  He wouldn't allow himself to be put in such a precarious position.  If the situation became hopeless, he would immediately withdraw.</p><p>The island was a scene of devastation.</p><p>A pillar of icy air, hundreds of meters in diameter, rose into the sky like a tornado, spinning rapidly.  At the center of the cage, a long, slender figure was clearly visible, ferocious and wreathed in lightning, relentlessly assaulting the icy prison.</p><p>The violent shaking and terrifying power made their hearts pound, a testament to the intensity of the battle.</p>
