<h1>Chapter 1788: Five Transformations Divine Ability</h1><p>The sky above the entire Jushan Altar was enveloped by auspicious clouds. Amidst the churning cloud vapors, tribulation clouds were born within the auspicious clouds themselves.</p><p>The rumbling of thunder intertwined with the roar of the vibrating auspicious clouds, making them difficult to distinguish.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up and saw dark clouds parting the auspicious clouds, converging overhead. Gray lightning coursed through the clouds, making the tribulation clouds appear even darker.</p><p>“Gray Tribulation Lightning!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression grew slightly solemn.</p><p>As expected, the Skyeye Butterfly originated from the same world as him, and thus had to undergo the baptism of Ascension Tribulation Lightning.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly had the ability to devour tribulation lightning.  If the situation became critical, he could also provide assistance.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried about the Skyeye Butterfly's safety, but he was concerned that others witnessing the Ascension Heavenly Tribulation would attract unnecessary trouble.</p><p>Glancing around, the courtyard was large, sealed on all four sides by ancient restrictions, likely some kind of spirit formation, but they couldn't find the formation's core.</p><p>The ancient formation formed a wall of golden light. Though it couldn't completely isolate the inside from the outside, it wasn't easy for outsiders to clearly see the layout within the courtyard.</p><p>It took the combined efforts of four Nascent Soul cultivators to barely open a gap and send Qin Sang inside.</p><p>Qin Sang had used the pretext of helping a spirit insect undergo its tribulation to set up the Star Essence Stone grand formation, also with the intention of isolating the interior.</p><p>With the two spirit formations overlapping, even if they couldn't completely block outside prying eyes, they could confuse their judgment.</p><p>After all, this place was different from the outside world. Tribulation clouds were born within the auspicious clouds, the two inextricably linked. The seven-colored auspicious clouds reflected a kaleidoscope of light, lavishly painting the tribulation clouds.  Strange lights abounded, with silver glimmers flickering. From a distance, it was difficult to discern the real from the illusory.</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang fully activated the Star Essence Stones. Dazzling starlight immediately erupted, combining with the surrounding formation restrictions to form a thick screen of light.</p><p>However, this could only conceal the celestial phenomena. The pressure and fluctuations brought by the Heavenly Tribulation couldn't be completely blocked and were gradually spreading outwards.</p><p>Outside the courtyard.</p><p>Three True Masters set up a killing formation, maintaining a vigilant watch. Sensing the fluctuations of the Heavenly Tribulation, they couldn't help but look towards the courtyard.</p><p>Faintly visible were swirling clouds and cascading light, a scene of utter chaos.</p><p>The pressure of the Heavenly Tribulation transmitted outwards, seemingly not as weak as anticipated.</p><p>But even in this realm, Five Transformations spirit insects were extremely rare. Spirit insects cultivated slowly, and nurturing them was even more difficult than training demonic soldiers. Even direct disciples of the Daoist sects rarely chose spirit insects as their forces.</p><p>Few had personally witnessed a spirit insect undergoing a Five Transformations Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation caused the auspicious clouds to churn.  The violent fluctuations combined with the pressure of the Heavenly Tribulation made it impossible to distinguish anything. The three True Masters' expressions remained unchanged, and they quickly refocused their attention on their surroundings.</p><p>Due to the special environment of this place, only those nearby could see the changes in the celestial phenomena, but the fluctuations could affect a vast area.</p><p>Just then, True Master Zhijian said in a deep voice, "Someone's coming!"</p><p>The other two True Masters' gazes sharpened, following True Master Zhijian's line of sight towards the east.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there were only palaces and pavilions, no figures in sight.</p><p>Focusing their senses, they indeed detected faint auras rapidly approaching, detected by their meticulously prepared warning formation. Clearly, they were attracted by the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>The newcomers were still some distance away, their identities—human or demon—unknown.</p><p>"Two!"</p><p>True Master Youhuang said in a low voice.</p><p>The three fell silent, suppressing their auras, ready to activate the killing formation at any moment.</p><p>The approaching individuals weren't reckless. After a burst of speed, they abruptly slowed down as they neared, using spells to conceal their presence, cautiously approaching.</p><p>By this time, the Skyeye Butterfly's Heavenly Tribulation had completed its final brewing.</p><p>Qin Sang transformed into his Spiritwood body, holding the Fixed Truth Pill. Whoever dared to interfere with the Skyeye Butterfly's tribulation would face his full-powered counterattack.</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>A spirit insect's transformation tribulation consisted only of lightning tribulation, a unique advantage they possessed.</p><p>Gray lightning serpents converged, forming a vortex of thunder at the center of the tribulation clouds, aimed directly at the Skyeye Butterfly below.</p><p>Perhaps because its master was by its side, the Skyeye Butterfly showed no fear or anxiety. Its wings fluttered once, and azure light rippled like waves as it actively flew towards the tribulation clouds.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A bolt of lightning split the sky.</p><p>There was no blinding flash. The courtyard suddenly plunged into darkness.</p><p>The lightning power within the tribulation clouds, without any outward display, poured down. As the tribulation lightning descended, the tribulation clouds also slowly dissipated.</p><p>Just like when it broke through to the Fourth Transformation, the spirit insect's Five Transformations Heavenly Tribulation also consisted of only a single bolt of lightning!</p><p>However, the power and momentum of this tribulation lightning were incomparable to before, especially since it was a mutated Ascension Tribulation!</p><p>A massive gray lightning pillar erupted from the center of the tribulation clouds. As the tribulation clouds churned, countless arcs of lightning descended, densely packed like a torrential downpour, instantly weaving a net in the air.</p><p>All the tribulation lightning targeted the Skyeye Butterfly, converging towards the central lightning pillar mid-air. Finally, like a torrent composed of heavenly lightning, it instantly submerged its target!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave. He could vaguely see the butterfly's silhouette within the tribulation lightning.</p><p>Bathed in the thunder, the Skyeye Butterfly's wings trembled violently, its Skyeye wide open. Then, two azure lightning bolts shot out.</p><p>The lightning bolts directly struck the tribulation lightning, causing violent thunderous explosions to scatter, blasting anything in the courtyard into dust.</p><p>At the same time, countless arcs of lightning jumped and flickered within the Skyeye.</p><p>Compared to the vast tribulation lightning, these arcs seemed tiny, but they contained a strange power. Upon touching some of the tribulation lightning, they dyed it azure, which was then devoured by the Skyeye.</p><p>At this point, the Skyeye Butterfly might not be able to provide much assistance for Qin Sang's tribulation, but its ability to devour tribulation lightning made it unafraid of the threat of the Heavenly Tribulation, a feat other spirit insects couldn't match.</p><p>From beginning to end, the Skyeye Butterfly hadn't sent any plea for help.</p><p>The scattered tribulation lightning was almost entirely devoured by the Skyeye Butterfly, while the main body of the tribulation lightning was significantly weakened by the two azure lightning bolts.</p><p>If it were a normal Heavenly Tribulation, it should have almost ended. But this was Gray Tribulation Lightning, its power still ferocious.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Azure lightning bolts continuously bombarded the tribulation lightning, yet they still couldn't stop it from relentlessly advancing.  The Skyeye Butterfly showed no intention of yielding, continuously flapping its wings, persistently struggling against the tribulation lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel tense. His figure shifted slightly, about to intervene.</p><p>Firstly, he was worried about the Skyeye Butterfly getting injured, and secondly, he had received True Master Zhijian's warning. Someone was approaching, and he needed to be ready to fight at any moment!</p><p>Just then, the Skyeye Butterfly suddenly made an unexpected move.  It folded its wings tightly together, seemingly giving up resistance. Azure light flickered on its body, and the halo surrounding it quickly solidified, forming an invisible, colorless membrane that covered its entire body.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The remaining tribulation lightning heavily bombarded the membrane.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. He flashed to the Skyeye Butterfly's side, restraining himself from intervening.</p><p>He could see that the moment the powerful tribulation lightning struck the membrane, it began to decompose layer by layer from the point of contact, transforming into countless arcs of lightning. Its momentum and power were drastically reduced.</p><p>In the next moment, two lightning bolts shot out from the membrane, completely shattering the tribulation lightning!</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly flapped its wings and rose, unharmed, weaving through the scattering arcs of lightning, devouring the remaining lightning power.  Finally, it shrunk to the size of an ordinary butterfly, happily circling Qin Sang once before landing on his shoulder, as if seeking praise.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Skyeye Butterfly with surprise, guessing that the membrane was a new divine ability the Skyeye Butterfly had comprehended after its transformation. Judging by its performance, it should be a kind of protective divine ability.</p><p>Spirit insects cultivated divine abilities individually. Unless they belonged to certain special lineages, most had fragile bodies, which was why Qin Sang hadn't dared to let the Skyeye Butterfly take risks before.</p><p>Breaking through to the Fifth Transformation, it had finally comprehended a protective divine ability, making up for the Skyeye Butterfly's biggest weakness.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel overjoyed, but there was no time to test the power of the new divine ability at this moment. The uninvited guests were already close!</p><p>Glancing outwards, Qin Sang immediately ordered the Skyeye Butterfly to return to his dantian.  The Skyeye Butterfly, still clinging close to Qin Sang, immersed in the excitement of its transformation, reluctantly flapped its wings a few times before flying back to the dantian.</p><p>The courtyard's formation restrictions were easier to exit than enter.  Qin Sang placed his hand on the light wall, and with a flash of light, he appeared outside. He then leaped towards the distance, into the alleyway between two golden palaces.</p><p>There were already five people in the alleyway, locked in a standoff.</p><p>One side consisted of the three True Masters, while the other side had a strange combination: a white-haired old Daoist and a young monk wearing a kasaya and bearing a ring scar on his head!</p><p>The monk and Daoist were startled by the sudden appearance of the three True Masters blocking their path, their faces full of wariness.</p><p>The three True Masters' expressions were also a bit strange. They exchanged glances, not expecting to encounter two cultivators instead of a Demon Marquis.</p><p>"So it's True Master Zhang and Venerable Zhenru."</p><p>True Master Guyun bowed slightly, recognizing the two.</p><p>"True Master Guyun, True Master Youhuang, and this must be True Master Zhijian!  A pleasure! A pleasure!"</p><p>The white-haired old Daoist, True Master Zhang, lightly waved his horsetail whisk and returned the greeting.</p><p>They all hailed from Jushan Altar. Nascent Soul True Masters were rare in Jushan Altar, and even if they hadn't interacted before, they had heard of each other.</p><p>This True Master Zhang came from a sect outside the Star Island Immortal Lake, called the One Feather Sect. Venerable Zhenru's sect, the Mirror Platform Temple, was near the One Feather Sect, a rare Buddhist lineage in this realm.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang stopped beside them, a bit surprised by the sight, and couldn't help but take a closer look at the monk.</p><p>Both uninvited guests were Nascent Soul cultivators, and the old Daoist was even more noteworthy.  Qin Sang noticed that he was at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, the highest cultivation level present.</p><p>His arrival drew everyone's attention. True Master Zhang sized him up and said, "This fellow Daoist looks unfamiliar.  Were you the one undergoing the tribulation just now?  It seems there's been a misunderstanding."</p><p>At this moment, True Master Zhijian transmitted a message, explaining the two newcomers' origins.</p><p>"So it's True Master Zhang and Venerable Zhenru. This humble Daoist is Qingfeng. My respects! My respects!" Qin Sang nodded and cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p>As fellow human cultivators, they couldn't possibly fight.  Although they had a numerical advantage, since they came to hunt Demon Marquises, they didn't want any unnecessary complications.</p><p>True Master Zhijian interjected, "Are you two fellow Daoists also here for the Daoist Decree?"</p><p>He got straight to the point.</p><p>With dwindling rewards from Jushan Altar, few people came here now. It was quite a coincidence to encounter them.</p><p>True Master Zhang paused before replying, "Venerable Zhenru has long wished to enter Jushan Altar to observe the divine abilities of the mighty ones. Coincidentally, this poor Daoist received news at the Dao Court and invited the Venerable One to come together.  We arrived not long ago and sensed the fluctuations of the Heavenly Tribulation, so we came to take a look. It seems that you True Masters are here for the same reason?"</p><p>Now that things were out in the open, the atmosphere gradually eased.</p><p>True Master Youhuang couldn't help but ask, "How long have you two fellow Daoists been here?  Have you discovered any traces of the Demon Marquises?"</p><p>"Not yet, otherwise we wouldn't be wandering around aimlessly like this," True Master Zhang slowly shook his head, then paused before continuing, "Since we have the same goal, why don't we join forces? What do you think?"</p><p>Qin Sang and the others weren't opposed to this. More people meant sharing the rewards, but it also meant more opportunities.</p><p>"How does True Master Zhang intend to cooperate?" True Master Zhijian asked on behalf of the group.</p><p>True Master Zhang looked towards the layers of golden palaces in the distance.  "This place is so vast, searching inch by inch, when will we find our target?  I'm afraid that by the time we find them, they'll have already accomplished their goal and left. We should split into two groups, leaving each other a means of contact, and join forces to hunt the demons once we find them!"</p><p>Hearing this, the four exchanged glances. They had actually discussed searching separately before.</p><p>However, they weren't sure how many Demon Marquises had infiltrated this place, and they were worried about suddenly encountering a powerful enemy alone, so they preferred to spend more time.</p><p>Although True Master Zhang and Venerable Zhenru were only two, True Master Zhang was a renowned powerhouse with unpredictable divine abilities.</p><p>True Master Zhijian nodded and handed over a Sword Talisman.  "Alright, if you two fellow Daoists discover any demons, activate this talisman, and this poor Daoist will know."</p><p>True Master Zhang readily accepted it and handed him a jade disc.</p><p>Next, both sides shared their findings. Qin Sang and the others had searched for so long, and combined with the routes True Master Zhang and Venerable Zhenru had taken, they had already covered half of the golden palaces.</p><p>After the agreement, everyone immediately split up.</p><p>Their ambush having failed, Qin Sang and the others deactivated the killing formation and continued along their previous route.</p><p>Qin Sang had thought he would need to spend some effort explaining, but the three were tactful and didn't inquire about the details of the spirit insect, which was a relief.</p><p>While traveling, Qin Sang focused part of his mind on his Qi Sea, communicating with the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly was in excellent condition. After its advancement, its cultivation level surpassed the limit of the altar, but there were no signs of mental instability.</p><p>The transformed Skyeye Butterfly's appearance hadn't changed significantly. Its intelligence had improved, but it was still a long way from communicating seamlessly with humans, which made Qin Sang sigh inwardly.</p><p>Although spirit insects didn't have to worry about the Four Nine Heavenly Tribulation, their path of cultivation was also arduous.</p><p>Without a chance to test the new divine ability, the Skyeye Butterfly was also digesting the gains from its transformation and familiarizing itself with the new divine ability.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the scene of the tribulation, analyzing it silently. The tribulation lightning formed from condensed lightning power clearly underwent a change upon contacting the membrane, transforming into arcs of lightning, significantly diminishing its momentum and power.</p><p>This reminded Qin Sang of a legendary divine ability – the Innate Separation and Reunion Divine Light!</p><p>Legend had it that this divine light could separate and reunite all things. Those with profound mastery could even directly transform an opponent's divine abilities back into their essential spiritual power, easily countering an opponent's attacks even if they had never seen them before.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly's new divine ability was definitely not that heaven-defying, but its manifestation seemed to possess similar power.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang became somewhat impatient.</p><p>It was the third day since the two groups had separated when a sudden earth-shattering boom startled Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The four rapidly flew to a higher vantage point and saw a crimson cloud of fire rising ahead. The fire cloud soared into the sky, shaking the entire golden palace.</p><p>In the next moment, a golden light shot out from the destroyed golden palace, flying like lightning towards the rear, vanishing into the Nine Curves Star River in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Immediately after, a figure vaguely emerged from the fire cloud and also rushed into the Nine Curves Star River, causing the Star River to tremble as the light within surged towards the intruder.</p><p>"Demon!"</p><p>True Master Zhijian shouted, his figure flashing as he gave chase, the other three following closely behind.</p>
