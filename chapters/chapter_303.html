<h1>Chapter 296: The Hunter and the Prey</h1><p>After a moment, the spiritual bamboo ship broke through the sea of fire and stopped abruptly in front of him.</p><p>Qin Sang stabbed out the ebony sword. Yunyouzi urged the magic tool to engage in combat, and the two fought with spirits howling and interweaving. It seemed thrilling, but in fact, it was under control. It was all a disguise.</p><p>While pretending to fight, they used their spiritual senses to communicate rapidly.</p><p>After a round of communication, Qin Sang learned the truth.</p><p>It turned out that after Qin Sang sent the message with the Xinxin Pendant, Sheng Yuanzi and Luo Xingnan received the news from the insider earlier, and the two groups of men ran into each other.</p><p>At this time, it was impossible for Yunyouzi and Ge Yuan to leave the team. However, after learning from Qin Sang that Yu Kong had laid a trap, they took the opportunity to agree on a strategy to escape.</p><p>However, they did not expect that when the real mutation occurred, Luo Xingnan had already been prepared, and he had prepared a talisman in advance, relying on the talisman to beat a hook snake king to pieces. Seeing this, Yunyouzi knew that there must be something going on, so he immediately gave up the idea of escaping alone and continued to lurk by Luo Xingnan's side.</p><p>Before escaping, Luo Xingnan also managed to plot against Sheng Yuanzi. Otherwise, Sheng Yuanzi would not have died so quickly.</p><p>In the end, because these hook snakes were too powerful, most of the people still died in their mouths, and only five of them escaped alive.</p><p>Luo Xingnan pretended to be dead, deceiving everyone.</p><p>The roles were suddenly reversed. Yu Kong became the prey, and Luo Xingnan became the hunter.</p><p>"I took advantage of the chaos to help Ge Yuan escape. He is now outside the restriction. He still has the Xinxin Pendant in his hand. Now, let Luo Xingnan help us explore the way. After you meet up, wait for my news..." Yunyouzi said.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated and couldn’t help frowning.</p><p>There were only three people on his side.</p><p>Luo Xingnan was the only mid-foundation master. Adding the old man surnamed Gong and the other three, their strength was several times greater than his own. Now, they had gained more strength. Shangguan Lifeng was also Luo Xingnan’s man. Wu Chen had been captured alive, and Yan Wu was missing.</p><p>The gap between the two sides could no longer be simply described as big. Even if they were in the dark, it would be difficult to achieve anything when they entered the mountains.</p><p>"I wonder if Junior Brother Qin has noticed that the aura of these spiritual medicines is not normal. I suspect that there are not so many spiritual medicines on the mountain, and they may not be enough for us to share." Yunyouzi said another piece of news that Qin Sang did not want to hear.</p><p>"What did senior discover?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked in a deep voice. If there were not enough spiritual medicines to be divided, a fight would be inevitable.</p><p>Yunyouzi shook his head and said, "I can't be sure now. I just feel that most of the auras are too thin and dim, unlike what千年灵药 should look like. However, I don't know if there are any other restrictions on the mountain. This kind of light may not represent the original aura of the spiritual medicine, but we must make preparations in advance."</p><p>Yunyouzi came from the Taiyi Danzong and had deep attainments in the Dao of alchemy. If he dared to say so, he must be 70% sure.</p><p>Qin Sang gave up the僥幸 psychology and thought about countermeasures.</p><p>The other side had a strong force. If he wanted to seize food from the tiger's mouth, he had to plan carefully.</p><p>Even if the possibility was very small, he had to go all out.</p><p>"According to my observation, those three people may not be willing to go all the way with Luo Xingnan.</p><p>The white-clothed scholar should have nothing to do with Luo Xingnan. He is a casual cultivator who was accidentally involved.</p><p>When surrounded by hook snakes, Luo Xingnan did not deliberately take care of him. This man's escaping technique is excellent. He relies on his extremely agile body technique to move around the battlefield and has not been injured. That is why he was able to catch up in time.</p><p>The man with the eagle-hook nose is surnamed Yin. He was originally one of Sheng Yuanzi's subordinates. This man can be called decisive. In order to survive, he betrayed Sheng Yuanzi on the spot, attacked him, and defected to Luo Xingnan.</p><p>Only the old man surnamed Gong, Luo Xingnan asked him to be an undercover agent under Sheng Yuanzi. Their relationship must be very good. Luo Xingnan trusted him deeply. At that time, the only person Luo Xingnan took away was him."</p><p>Yunyouzi made a brief introduction of Luo Xingnan's helpers.</p><p>After listening to him, Qin Sang felt relieved.</p><p>The other party was not a monolith. Apart from the old man surnamed Gong, the other two could be persuaded. As long as there was enough benefit, they could betray Luo Xingnan at any time.</p><p>Neither he nor Yunyouzi were greedy people. They only took the spiritual medicine they needed. If it was absolutely necessary, they could even trade with other conditions.</p><p>However, if the spiritual medicine on the mountain could not satisfy Luo Xingnan's appetite, would he be willing to give up the benefits?</p><p>Luo Xingnan was the strongest among the crowd and had helpers by his side. He only needed to distribute some to appease his cronies to forcibly seize the shares of others.</p><p>The other people were scattered and did not dare to argue with Luo Xingnan.</p><p>With a little effort at that time, they could stir up the wind and rain.</p><p>"How much do you know about Yu Kong's followers, Junior Brother Qin?"</p><p>Cloud Wanderer asked again, and deliberately mentioned, "Shangguan Lifeng, Fellow Daoist Ge, I didn't know Shao Chunhui had disciples. I wonder about his personality?"</p><p>Qin Sang understood the meaning behind Cloud Wanderer's words.</p><p>If Shangguan Lifeng was a person who repaid kindness, then after Luo Xingnan helped him avenge his master, he would definitely obey Luo Xingnan and would not be tempted by them.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind quickly flashed back over his memories of this period of time and found that his impression of Shangguan Lifeng was very vague. This person was taciturn, and all day long was absorbed in studying the meaning of the saber through his precious saber, rarely communicating with others.</p><p>If he was not being deceptive, people with this kind of personality did not have much potential for betrayal.</p><p>Qin Sang communicated his judgment to Cloud Wanderer.</p><p>The two directly classified him as being on Luo Xingnan's side.</p><p>"It's certain that Wu Chen is a casual cultivator," Qin Sang paused, then continued, "The person who escaped with me is called Yan Wu. This person is Yu Kong's confidant."</p><p>"Luo Xingnan, that Elder with the surname Gong, Shangguan Lifeng; you, me, Fellow Daoist Ge, plus the man with the surname Yin, the Virtuous Scholar in White, and Wu Chen..."</p><p>Cloud Wanderer's tone became more and more relaxed. "If Junior Brother Qin can find the opportunity to steal the spirit medicine, that would be great. Even if we directly confront them, it's six on three. We might even be victorious. In the later stages of breaking the restriction, someone might get injured or even die. After all, Luo Xingnan definitely will not let his confidants scout the way... However, if the timing is right, our strength will not be much weaker than Luo Xingnan's. This matter is very promising! At this time, every additional person means more strength. It would be great if we could save Yan Wu."</p><p>Their communication via divine sense was very fast. Though it seemed like they had said a lot, in reality only a few breaths had passed. There was still time to save Yan Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly frowned, but in the end he nodded in agreement.</p><p>His conflict with Yan Wu was not small, but not very big either. Furthermore, it was Yan Wu who had lost face. He himself had not taken any losses, and there was really no point in holding onto it.</p><p>Before, he had been wary of Yan Wu because of Yu Kong, but now that Yu Kong was dead, Yan Wu had lost his backer, and he definitely no longer took Yan Wu seriously.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer was right. Getting the spirit medicine was the top priority, and the greater good was more important.</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that Qin Sang trusted Yan Wu. He simply wanted to use Yan Wu to restrain Luo Xingnan, and he would also constantly pay attention to Yan Wu's actions.</p><p>The two came to a decisive decision and put away their respective magic tools, boarding Cloud Wanderer's spirit bamboo flying boat.</p><p>Chapter 296: Hunter and Hunted</p><p>Moments later, the Spirit Bamboo flying boat broke through the sea of fire and stopped abruptly before him.</p><p>Qin Sang lunged, thrusting his Ebony Sword forward, while Wandering Scholar countered with his own magical artifact.  Their spiritual power howled as they exchanged blows, a seemingly thrilling duel, yet both remained in control, their battle a mere facade.</p><p>As they pretended to fight, they swiftly communicated through divine sense.</p><p>Only after this exchange did Qin Sang learn the truth.</p><p>It turned out that when Qin Sang sent his message using the Linked Heart Pendant, Sheng Yuanzi and Luo Xingnan had already received intel from their inside sources, and their groups had happened to clash.</p><p>By then, it was impossible for Wandering Scholar and Ge Yuan to break away. However, learning about Yu Kong's trap from Qin Sang, they devised an escape plan.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when the true chaos erupted, Luo Xingnan had been prepared. He unleashed a Talisman Treasure, crippling a Hook Serpent King.  Witnessing this, Wandering Scholar immediately suspected foul play and abandoned his initial plan of escaping alone, choosing instead to remain undercover by Luo Xingnan's side.</p><p>Before escaping, Luo Xingnan even managed to sabotage Sheng Yuanzi, which explained the latter's swift demise.</p><p>Ultimately, due to the overwhelming power of the Hook Serpents, most perished, leaving only five survivors.</p><p>Luo Xingnan feigned his death, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The roles were reversed. Yu Kong, the hunter, became the hunted, while Luo Xingnan took his place as the hunter.</p><p>“Amidst the chaos, I helped Fellow Daoist Ge Yuan escape. He's currently outside the barrier, still holding the Linked Heart Pendant. Let Luo Xingnan scout the path for now. Rendezvous with Ge Yuan and await my instructions...”</p><p>Wandering Scholar explained.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated their situation, his brow furrowing.</p><p>They were only three.</p><p>Luo Xingnan was the sole Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivator.  Combined with Elder Gong and the other two, their strength was several times greater than their own.  Now with their ranks bolstered, Shangguan Lifeng was also on Luo Xingnan's side. Wu Chen had been captured alive, and Yan Wu's fate remained unknown.</p><p>The disparity between them was immense. Even with the element of surprise, achieving anything substantial within the mountain would be difficult.</p><p>"Has Junior Brother Qin noticed anything unusual about the spiritual herbs' aura? I suspect there aren't as many on the mountain as it seems, and they may not be enough to share," Wandering Scholar added another piece of unwelcome news.</p><p>“What have you discovered, Senior?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked gravely, aware that a shortage of spiritual herbs would inevitably lead to conflict.</p><p>Wandering Scholar shook his head, saying, "I can't be certain yet, but most of the auras seem too weak and dim, unlike what one would expect from thousand-year-old herbs.  However, I'm unsure of other restrictions on the mountain; the light may not accurately reflect the herbs' true aura. We must still prepare for the worst."</p><p>Hailing from the Taiyi Pill Sect, Wandering Scholar possessed profound knowledge of alchemy. His assessment suggested a high degree of certainty.</p><p>Qin Sang abandoned any lingering hope and contemplated their options.</p><p>Their opponents were powerful. Snatching their prize from their jaws would require careful planning.</p><p>Even if the chances were slim, they had to give it their all.</p><p>"From my observation, those three may not be entirely loyal to Luo Xingnan.  The scholar in white doesn't seem connected to him.  He’s likely a rogue cultivator caught in the crossfire.  When we were surrounded by the Hook Serpents, Luo Xingnan showed no concern for his safety. The scholar's escape technique is exceptional.  He relies on incredibly agile movements, avoiding injury and managing to keep up.</p><p>The man with the hooked nose is surnamed Yin.  Originally one of Sheng Yuanzi's men, he's remarkably decisive. To survive, he betrayed Sheng Yuanzi on the spot and joined Luo Xingnan's side.</p><p>Only Elder Gong, sent by Luo Xingnan to infiltrate Sheng Yuanzi's group, has deep ties with him and enjoys his full trust. He was the only one Luo Xingnan specifically brought along.”</p><p>Wandering Scholar briefly described Luo Xingnan's allies.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt somewhat relieved.</p><p>Their opponents were not a united front.  Except for Elder Gong, the other two could be swayed. With sufficient incentive, they could be persuaded to betray Luo Xingnan.</p><p>Neither he nor Wandering Scholar were greedy, seeking only the herbs they needed.  If necessary, they could even offer alternatives for trade.</p><p>But if the mountain's herbs weren't enough to satisfy Luo Xingnan, would he willingly share?</p><p>As the strongest among them, with allies at his side, Luo Xingnan could easily seize the lion's share, leaving only scraps for his followers.</p><p>The others, a disorganized bunch, wouldn't dare challenge him.</p><p>With a little manipulation, they could sow discord among them.</p><p>“What does Junior Brother Qin know about Yu Kong's people?”</p><p>Wandering Scholar inquired, adding pointedly, "Shangguan Lifeng… Fellow Daoist Ge Yuan didn't know Shao Chunhui had a disciple.  I wonder about this disciple's character?"</p><p>Qin Sang understood the implication.</p><p>If Shangguan Lifeng were grateful, after Luo Xingnan avenged his master, he would undoubtedly be loyal and impossible to sway.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly reviewed his memories, finding his impression of Shangguan Lifeng quite vague. The man was quiet, always immersed in honing his blade skills, rarely interacting with others.</p><p>Unless it was an act, someone with such a personality was unlikely to betray their loyalty.</p><p>Qin Sang shared his assessment with Wandering Scholar.</p><p>They categorized him as part of Luo Xingnan's group.</p><p>“Wu Chen is definitely a rogue cultivator,” Qin Sang paused, then continued, “The one who escaped with me is called Yan Wu. He's Yu Kong's trusted subordinate.”</p><p>"Luo Xingnan, Elder Gong, and Shangguan Lifeng; you, me, and Fellow Daoist Ge Yuan, along with Yin and the scholar in white, plus Wu Chen…"</p><p>Wandering Scholar’s tone grew lighter.  “If Junior Brother Qin can find a chance to steal the herbs, that's ideal. Even in a direct confrontation, six against three, we still have a chance. Others might get injured or even die while navigating the barriers, as Luo Xingnan wouldn’t risk his own men… However, with the right timing, our strength won't be far inferior to Luo Xingnan's.  There's hope yet!  Every additional person strengthens our side. Rescuing Yan Wu would be a significant advantage.”</p><p>Their divine sense communication was incredibly fast. Despite the lengthy exchange, only a few moments had passed. There was still time to save Yan Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, but ultimately agreed.</p><p>His conflict with Yan Wu was minor.  He hadn't suffered any real loss, so there was no need to dwell on it.</p><p>His previous wariness stemmed from Yu Kong's presence. Now that Yu Kong was dead and Yan Wu had lost his backing, he no longer considered him a threat.</p><p>Wandering Scholar was right; securing the herbs was paramount. The bigger picture mattered most.</p><p>This didn't mean Qin Sang fully trusted Yan Wu. He would use him to counter Luo Xingnan while remaining vigilant of his actions.</p><p>Without hesitation, they sheathed their artifacts and boarded Wandering Scholar's Spirit Bamboo flying boat.</p>
