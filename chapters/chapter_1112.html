<h1>Chapter 1104: Mei Gu</h1><p>After retrieving the Demon-Binding Rope, Qin Sang did not linger for long in the ancient cultivator's ruins. Upon leaving the secret realm, he decided to head east, planning to enter through the Yin Mountain Pass. The Yin Mountain Pass had previously been occupied by Nascent Soul cultivators and served as a buffer zone between the righteous and demonic sects, making it a safer route compared to the Hanging Skull Pass—provided that the Seven Heroic Passes had not changed hands.</p><p>During his journey eastward, Qin Sang occasionally fed the Fire Jade Centipede with Crimson Fire Gold. Over time, the centipede grew less hostile toward him. Qin Sang kept a small amount of Crimson Fire Gold for emergencies, giving the rest to the centipede. Whether it would undergo a transformation was now up to fate.</p><p>The spiritual tide waned day by day. By the time Qin Sang reached the vicinity of the Yin Mountain Pass, the tide had almost completely dissipated. It was then that he finally encountered other cultivators, learning why so few remained in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. He also gained some understanding of the current state of the cultivation world.</p><p>As expected, after the closure of the Purple Micro Palace, the Sin Abyss had immediately invaded the Heavenly Alliance. Fortunately, the Sin Abyss's sneak attack using the Immortal Formation had not dealt a crippling blow to the Frost Domain and the Heavenly Alliance. Instead, it had forced the two regions to set aside their differences and unite against the Sin Abyss. What followed was a century-long war that had yet to reach a conclusion.</p><p>The Sin Abyss was formidable. Even with the Frost Domain and the Heavenly Alliance joining forces, they were initially no match and were forced to retreat, ceding much of the Heavenly Alliance's territory before finally stabilizing their defenses. Despite being unable to fully conquer the two regions, the Sin Abyss refused to withdraw, frequently launching harassing attacks. The major factions had been primarily focused on resisting the Sin Abyss.</p><p>It wasn't until about two decades before the reappearance of the Purple Micro Palace, when the spiritual tide emerged, that the situation began to ease. No one had anticipated that the war would last this long. Over time, the cultivators of the three regions had grown accustomed to the state of war. The Frost Domain and the Heavenly Alliance, united against a common enemy, formed an alliance. Their previous animosity had diminished, and they even began to show signs of integration. The Frost Domain no longer restricted Heavenly Alliance cultivators from entering the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>The two sides now faced off at the border. As a result, the cultivators stationed at the Seven Heroic Passes had been redeployed, and most of the passes were sealed off except under special circumstances. Since the Yin Mountain Pass lay between the righteous and demonic sects, it was the only remaining passage for cultivators to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, aside from the Demon City controlled by the demonic races. This arrangement had been agreed upon by all major factions.</p><p>As Qin Sang approached the Yin Mountain Pass, he began to encounter cultivators more frequently. Both the Frost Domain and the Heavenly Alliance were represented, though most were of low cultivation levels, with few reaching the late Foundation Establishment stage. It was said that before the opening of the Purple Micro Palace, the alliance of the two regions had amassed a significant force at the border to guard against the Sin Abyss.</p><p>This situation was far better than Qin Sang had anticipated. He had even prepared for the worst—that the Frost Domain might fall to the Sin Abyss and be completely annihilated. Qin Sang learned that the war had made the alliance highly vigilant toward any cultivators within their territories who had surpassed the Foundation Establishment stage. Everyone was required to register and be ready for conscription at any time. Entering or leaving the Yin Mountain Pass involved strict inspections, and one needed a token issued by the alliance.</p><p>Had Qin Sang tried to enter during the tense periods, disguising his identity would have been a complicated ordeal. Fortunately, with the easing of tensions, the inspections had become less stringent. However, his late Core Formation cultivation level would stand out conspicuously among these low-level cultivators. With such strength, even as a rogue cultivator, it would be impossible to remain unnoticed, and he would easily attract unwanted attention.</p><p>Upon learning that Shao Hua Mountain and Dongyang Bo were still alive and even more renowned than before he left, Qin Sang became even more cautious about drawing attention to himself. After some thought, he decided to temporarily suppress his cultivation. By dispersing the Killing Talisman created by Senior Qingzhu, Qin Sang's cultivation level dropped back to the early Core Formation stage. He could return to the mid-stage at any time by completing the sixth stroke of the Killing Talisman.</p><p>For now, Qin Sang restrained himself, donned a mask, and headed for the Yin Mountain Pass. Unexpectedly, signs of a celestial phenomenon appeared midway. Qin Sang flew for a while before finding a refuge. The refuge was built at the bottom of a valley between two barren mountains, with the underground space hollowed out into a circular chamber. Layers of restrictions indicated that this refuge had existed for a long time, having sheltered countless cultivators over the years.</p><p>Upon entering, Qin Sang found dozens of cultivators already inside. Concealing his aura and disguising himself as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he mingled with the crowd, subtly probing for information. As the celestial phenomenon drew nearer, waves of cultivators continued to arrive.</p><p>At that moment, three men and one woman entered the refuge. The female cultivator was strikingly beautiful, with a fox-like charm and a mastery of seduction techniques. Among the three men, two were middle-aged, while the third appeared youthful. All four were at the Foundation Establishment stage!</p><p>"The Four Demon Wanderers!" someone whispered.</p><p>A stir rippled through the crowd, as the four seemed to have a notorious reputation. Under the watchful eyes of everyone, they calmly strode into the refuge. The somewhat crowded space quickly cleared a path for them.</p><p>Hearing the nearby cultivators discussing the deeds of the four, Qin Sang glanced over, his eyes flickering with surprise. The aura of one of the youths felt strangely familiar to him. Without hesitation, Qin Sang removed the Thousand Jun Ring, stood up, and walked directly toward the Four Demon Wanderers.</p><p>His actions drew many gazes, and the onlookers' expressions varied. The Four Demon Wanderers immediately noticed Qin Sang. The enchanting woman flashed a radiant smile, secretly activating her seduction technique, while the three men glared at Qin Sang with fierce eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang remained composed, step by step approaching the four. It was then that they noticed something amiss. The youth among them was trembling, drenched in sweat, his eyes filled with terror as if he had seen a ghost. The other three, well aware of their companion's strength, were utterly shocked by this sight.</p><p>"Sit," Qin Sang said softly as he reached the youth.</p><p>The youth collapsed to the ground, the overwhelming pressure finally lifting. He gasped for breath, too terrified to even wipe the sweat from his face. He wanted to prostrate himself in reverence, but Qin Sang stopped him.</p><p>The other three, though unsure of what had happened, dared not act rashly. They obediently sat down beside their companion, silent and trembling.</p><p>"Are you the Fire Demon? Who taught you the *Seven Yang Art*?" Qin Sang asked, setting up a soundproof barrier.</p><p>The *Seven Yang Art* was a technique created by the Golden Core cultivator of the Ghost Yin Sect, the Robed Vulture Daoist, after he established the Demonic Flame Sect. It was passed down to the sect's disciples as a core inheritance. This technique required the power of earth fire to cultivate, and those who practiced it carried a unique aura. Qin Sang had encountered this aura when he once met disciples of the Demonic Flame Sect.</p><p>The youth replied meekly, "Esteemed Senior, this junior hails from the Demonic Flame Sect. The *Seven Yang Art* was personally taught to me by the sect's leader."</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang identify his cultivation technique, the youth grew anxious, fearing that Qin Sang might have some grudge against his sect. Yet, he dared not lie.</p><p>The Demonic Flame Sect still existed! Qin Sang recalled that after exterminating the remnants of the Ghost Yin Sect, he had handed the Demonic Flame Sect over to a disciple named Mei Gu, entrusting her with its leadership. He had never returned since. At that time, Mei Gu had only been at the early Foundation Establishment stage, yet she was already the strongest in the sect.</p>
