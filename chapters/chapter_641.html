<h1>Chapter 633: Revenge</h1><p>Earlier, when encountering Yuan Hu, Qin Sang had noticed something unusual about the tattoos on the two Tianyue Village priestesses.  Now, watching the female priestess dance, he saw the full picture.</p><p>“Could it be a type of divine script?”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the priestess, murmuring.</p><p>He discovered that after the divine script appeared on the priestess's body, a previously unseen, peculiar power flowed from the distant members of the Wu tribe.</p><p>Some converged on the priestess, while some drifted into the mountains, absorbed by other Winged Viper Village priestesses.</p><p>After absorbing this power, the divine script on the priestess's body showed a clear enhancement.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The power of the divine script erupted. The priestess suddenly went into a frenzy, raising her arms, uttering strange cries, and shouting towards the heavens, as if trying to fly.</p><p>The moon remained bright.</p><p>But around Winged Viper Village, a light mist began to fall.</p><p>The Wu people cheered, regarding it as rain bestowed by the witch god, lifting their faces and opening their mouths to receive the water.</p><p>“What an extraordinary divine script!”</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with admiration.</p><p>He had thought that witchery was merely a means for Wu cultivators to control ordinary people. Now, it seemed far more complex.</p><p>This rain was clearly summoned by the priestess, but Qin Sang didn't detect any incantations. It was purely the power of the divine script, influencing the natural world.</p><p>To Qin Sang, the power of the divine script on the priestess was weak, but he could see that the script itself was extraordinary, a unique ability of the Wu tribe.</p><p>He even felt that its potential surpassed that of the life-bound insect Gu.</p><p>Life-bound insect Gu are external objects, while the divine script is inseparable from the cultivator, a power controlled by the cultivator themselves.</p><p>But for some reason, the Wu cultivators seemed to regard life-bound insect Gu as their most important tool, paying little attention to the divine script.  Even Yuan Hu and Cui Xuanzi of the Five Insect Sect had no such script on their bodies.</p><p>Why did the Five Insect Sect abandon this path, so clearly suitable for Wu cultivators?</p><p>Was there no future for the divine script?</p><p>Or, had the Wu tribe, like humanity, lost many things from ancient times to the present day?</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>At that moment, the priestess changed her dance. The rain gradually stopped.  She pointed towards a wooden building by the lake, and the moonlight converged there, illuminating the building's front as bright as day.</p><p>There, ‘virgins’ in gorgeous feathered attire, each pure and beautiful, holding various strange flowers and herbs, formed a line. Guided by the moonlight, they walked towards the mountain.</p><p>These strange flowers and herbs were all types of spiritual herbs. The virgin at the front carried a blood-red-leaved herb—the Red Leaf Grass.</p><p>They ascended a stone staircase leading to a cave.</p><p>The cave was pitch black, with occasional hissing sounds emanating from within. Some of the virgins were terrified, while others were expectant.</p><p>No one noticed that the virgin at the front, holding the Red Leaf Grass, trembled slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang stood silently in the shadows.</p><p>Finally, the line of virgins reached the cave.</p><p>The leading virgin was about to step inside when she suddenly stopped.</p><p>The priestess, unprepared for this, hesitated in her dance, anger flashing in her eyes as she pointed at the virgin. The moonlight gathered behind the virgin, about to push her into the cave.</p><p>Suddenly, a brilliant azure sword light flashed from the virgin!</p><p>In that instant, even the moon in the sky dimmed.</p><p>A dragon-like sword cry instantly drowned out the sound of war drums, echoing through the mountains and valleys, as if countless swords were drawn, shaking the heavens and earth!</p><p>The priestess was shocked, her face filled with terror.</p><p>A thunderous roar echoed from the mountain, “Who dares to disrupt our tribe's affairs! Show yourself!”</p><p>Then, trees shook as several figures dashed from the forest.  The leading elder was filled with rage, staring fixedly at Ya Gu and her cold-gold sword.</p><p>With his keen eyesight, he could see that the sword wasn't controlled by Ya Gu; someone else was behind it!</p><p>However, what troubled the elder was his inability to sense anyone nearby.  He couldn't detect the hidden person through the cold-gold sword.</p><p>The fact that someone had infiltrated the village undetected filled the elder with growing unease. He shouted, "Bone Array!"</p><p>Around Winged Viper Village, a clicking sound came from the ground. Then, skeletons emerged from the earth—some animal bones, some human bones, none complete.</p><p>The ghostly white bones looked even more ghastly under the moonlight, striking fear into many of the girls, causing them to cry.</p><p>As the Bone Array manifested, blue flames, like a blue galaxy, slow yet swift, flew from the gaps between the bones towards Ya Gu.</p><p>Ya Gu, seemingly oblivious to her surroundings, gripped her cold-iron sword and unleashed a devastating blow at the cave entrance.</p><p>The flash of her blade was blinding.</p><p>With a deafening roar, the cave collapsed.</p><p>Rocks and debris rained down, interspersed with the severed remains of several snakes.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The elder, the priestess, and the others paled, screaming in terror as their life-bound insect-gu were effortlessly cut down, offering no resistance.</p><p>Panic seized them.  They realized their unseen assailant was terrifyingly powerful, capable of easily slaughtering them.  Abandoning even their bone array, they fled.</p><p>Ya Gu turned, delivering a second strike, shattering the blue flames of the bone array.</p><p>She hesitated before her third strike, but ultimately, she acted decisively.</p><p>“You all deserve to die!”</p><p>Her eyes blazing, fueled by her vengeance and the power of her sword, and the unseen help she received,  she finally released her pent-up hatred.  Even in her rage, her voice retained a haunting beauty, though only Qin Sang seemed to notice.</p><p>The priestess, having reached the center of the lake, suddenly felt a chill on her chest.  She looked down to see the sword tip, having passed through her heart.  Her body fell into the lake.</p><p>Ya Gu, still clutching the cold-iron sword, had killed her first victim.  Stained with the priestess's blood, she gasped for breath, the thick smell of blood nearly suffocating her. Qin Sang remained impassively aloof, offering no aid.</p><p>These three strikes seemed to drain Ya Gu's strength, but she persevered, lifting her sword and pursuing the fleeing elder and his followers into the deep mountains.</p><p>With a swift motion, she and her sword closed the distance.  The slick young man was the first to fall, his head severed and sent flying into the air.</p><p>One by one, the priests of Yi Hui Village fell before Ya Gu's blade.</p><p>Blood stained the forest floor.</p><p>Only the elder remained.  His face contorted in disbelief and rage, he screamed,  “Who are you?! We have no quarrel, why slaughter my entire clan?!”</p><p>The cold-iron sword pierced his heart.</p><p>“Kill! Kill! Kill!”</p><p>Ya Gu's eyes were bloodshot, consumed by a murderous rage, repeating the word “kill” incessantly.  She tried to desecrate the elder’s corpse when a hand restrained her.</p><p>“Sleep,”</p><p>A gentle voice cut through the frenzy.  The murderous intent instantly ebbed from Ya Gu's heart. Obediently, she closed her eyes and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>(The next chapter will be delayed. Please don't wait up; check it tomorrow.)</p>
