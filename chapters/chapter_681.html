<h1>Chapter 673: Duyan Island</h1><p>Chapter 673: Duyan Island</p><p>“Elder Zou, this is Daoist Qingfeng, as I mentioned.  Daoist Qingfeng, this is Elder Zou,”</p><p>Ran Luo introduced them.</p><p>“Indeed,” Qin Sang nodded and bowed, “Qingfeng greets Elder Zou.”</p><p>This person’s aura was subtle, his cultivation extremely high. He looked young, but he was undoubtedly an old monster.  </p><p>Besides, Qin Sang might need to rely on him for future opportunities, so he was very polite.</p><p>“I’ve heard Ran Luo speak highly of Daoist Qingfeng.  I’ve been tied up with matters, and apologize for the delay. Please forgive me,” Elder Zou said amiably, appearing approachable.</p><p>This wasn't the place for conversation. After exchanging greetings, the group immediately set off, using their movement techniques to swiftly head towards Witch God Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang then noticed the charming woman who had arrived with Ran Luo was very close to Elder Zou, but they didn’t seem to be a couple.</p><p>The woman’s name was Yan Wu, also a Nascent Soul early-stage cultivator, and surprisingly, a member of the Witch Tribe.</p><p>Several streams of light soared into the air, flashing like meteors towards Witch God Mountain.</p><p>Soon, Witch God Mountain came into view.</p><p>From afar, they could see many figures at the foot of Witch God Mountain, all Witch Tribe people coming to pay homage.</p><p>Witch God Mountain was the Witch Tribe’s recognized sacred mountain. No one dared to occupy it alone, so there were no Witch Tribe sects on the mountain; it was jointly guarded by all Witch Tribe forces.</p><p>This was why the teleportation array leading to the Demon Sea was set up on Witch God Mountain.</p><p>There were many ancient and imposing halls on the mountain, and the teleportation array was located within one of them.</p><p>“Let’s land below. Everyone approaching Witch God Mountain must descend and walk up the mountain as a sign of respect, otherwise it will cause anger,”</p><p>Elder Zou transmitted his voice.</p><p>They could see that the cultivators who had arrived at Witch God Mountain before them had also landed and were walking up the mountain along the stone steps.</p><p>It was best to be cautious in a foreign land. Qin Sang immediately put away his ebony sword, his light flashed, and he landed on a flat area at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Elder Zou, the fastest, waited ahead. Upon seeing Qin Sang arrive, his eyes lit up.  He said, “Unexpectedly, Daoist friend not only excels in refining weapons but also possesses extraordinary swordsmanship.  Your superb sword skills alone make you worthy of our full recruitment.  I sincerely invite you to join our Qiongyu Merchant Guild. This is information about Duyan Island, our planned base in the Demon Sea. Please take a look.”</p><p>Elder Zou handed Qin Sang a jade slip.</p><p>“Before Elder Zou, my meager skills are nothing, merely showing off in front of a master.”</p><p>Qin Sang humbly replied, feeling somewhat embarrassed.  With the help of his natal spirit sword, his swordsmanship was indeed impressive, but if he used another spirit sword, his true level would be revealed.</p><p>The jade slip contained very detailed information, including the identity of the island master, and nothing was concealed from Qin Sang.</p><p>Duyan Island was a large island between the Great Desolation Island and the Heavenly Witch Island, occupying a crucial position on the shipping route. The island master was a renowned Nascent Soul Grandmaster named Lin Hai.</p><p>Before Lin Hai took up residence on Duyan Island, the island hadn’t held such an important position.  After cultivators settled on Duyan Island, they were attacked by demonic beasts many times, with countless casualties, only a few escaping.</p><p>This was related to Duyan Island’s location.</p><p>Duyan Island was the most prominent island on the entire route.  If something happened, reinforcements couldn’t arrive quickly.  Furthermore, there was a bottomless trench near Duyan Island, teeming with demonic beasts.</p><p>Excessive hunting of demonic beasts here could easily enrage them, leading to unstoppable beast tides.</p><p>After Lin Hai settled on Duyan Island, with a Nascent Soul Grandmaster in residence, Duyan Island became a stabilizing force.</p><p>At the same time, Lin Hai established many rules, such as not allowing cultivators to hunt demonic beasts in large groups, limiting them to small teams of only a few people, and prohibiting wanton slaughter…</p><p>Since then, Duyan Island had become very safe; the most amazing thing was that there hadn’t been a single demonic beast attack.</p><p>Over the years, the shipping routes had changed several times, and thanks to Lin Hai’s hard work, Duyan Island achieved its current status.</p><p>Securing a place on such a large island wasn't easy, and Elder Zou and the Qiongyu Merchant Guild had put in considerable effort.</p><p>The jade slip not only contained information about Duyan Island, but also brief introductions to other famous islands in the Demon Sea.</p><p>After reviewing everything, Qin Sang found Duyan Island to be an excellent choice.</p><p>He was skilled in escape techniques, always able to get away in case of danger, so fewer teammates wouldn’t be a problem.  His main goal wasn’t hunting demonic beasts, but comprehending the Killing Talisman, requiring powerful opponents; he wouldn’t actively engage in massacres.</p><p>Compared to other large islands, each has its own strict rules, even stricter than Biduyan Island, comparable to the regulations of a cultivation sect.</p><p>Of course, you don't have to be bound by these rules.</p><p>You could go to the smaller islands, or even occupy an island and become its ruler, living freely. The Demon Sea is vast and boundless, with countless large and small islands scattered across it, plenty to choose from.</p><p>But these places are not safe; survival is precarious.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered the jade slip's contents without immediately replying to Elder Zou.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, they had already reached the Witch God Mountain. Elder Zou seemed very familiar with the place, leading them through various halls until they arrived at a hall called the Heavenly Witch Hall.</p><p>A Wu elder happened to come out. Seeing them, he sneered, "Elder Zou, you're back?  You've withdrawn so many Nascent Soul stage experts from Pingbo Port this time, it must be almost empty! Aren't you afraid someone will take advantage of the situation and destroy the foundation that humanity has cultivated for years?"</p><p>Elder Zou coldly snorted, "Old man, you have the nerve to say that! If it weren't for your Wu clan's treachery, we wouldn't be in this situation. Compared to life and death, what is Pingbo Port?"</p><p>The elder chuckled, "You humans are cunning and always project your own flaws onto others..."</p><p>He said no more. After receiving the spirit stones, he gave each of them a talisman shaped like a small arrow before letting them in.</p><p>"This talisman is a transmission talisman, capable of withstanding the spatial pressure during transmission. The teleportation array to the Demon Sea is an ancient array that was relocated and modified. It's prone to instability and sometimes encounters spatial turbulence.  Normally, we Nascent Soul stage cultivators can resist spatial pressure with all our strength. But if turbulence occurs, we must rely on these talismans for protection. To be safe, everyone should activate the talisman before teleporting..."</p><p>Ran Luo softly explained the use of the talismans to Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised.</p><p>In Xiaohan Domain, they can only utilize existing ancient teleportation arrays or those with minor damage that can be repaired.  No sect has been heard of modifying ancient teleportation arrays.</p><p>Modifying an ancient teleportation array must require extremely harsh conditions; otherwise, the Canglang Sea would be full of teleportation arrays.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the teleportation array, recalling the scene of his teleportation from Ziwei Palace. If he had had such a talisman then, perhaps he wouldn't have had to sacrifice his arm.</p>
