<h1>Chapter 1940:  Down the Mountain</h1><p>Chen Xiucai and Yu Chenghuang were both great conversationalists, and Yi Panguan and Liu Dafu’s supporting roles were perfectly timed.  Qin Sang occasionally interjected a few words, but mostly listened with relish to their conversation, occasionally refilling their wine cups. This table, a gathering of mortals and immortals, was a unique experience.</p><p>‘Sizzle…sizzle…’</p><p>Qin Sang personally wielded the knife, grilling the meat over charcoal until slightly charred, then sprinkling on seasoning powder. Every movement was precise, every detail perfect. After grilling, she handed a few skewers to her apprentices.</p><p>The four youngsters huddled in a corner, eating until their mouths were greasy.</p><p>“You…on the mountain…ow, it’s burning!”</p><p>Tao Teng gasped repeatedly, unwilling to spit out the meat in his mouth. He swallowed it with difficulty, feeling the deliciousness penetrate his very bones.  Whether from the heat or jealousy, Tao Teng’s eyes reddened as he looked at Yu Lang. “It’s…a truly godly life!”</p><p>Mingyan, the young servant, nodded in complete agreement.</p><p>“Just eat yours!”</p><p>Yu Lang tossed Tao Teng a spirit fruit to shut him up.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Someone was frantically knocking on the door outside.</p><p>Liu Dafu jumped, and Yu Chenghuang and Yi Panguan both turned to look.</p><p>Qin Sang said it was alright, got up and opened the door. Zhuque, the vermillion bird, flew in stealthily.  Having been scolded several times, it had finally learned its lesson and didn’t shout or cry out, instead staring intently at the meat in Qin Sang’s hands.</p><p>Qin Sang had already prepared a plate for it.  Ignoring everyone else, Zhuque buried its head in the food and ate ravenously.</p><p>Everyone at the table watched Zhuque devour the meat.</p><p>“Even the birds love it; it must be delicious,” Liu Dafu chuckled.</p><p>Zhuque glared at him and continued to eat.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang and Yi Panguan kept studying Zhuque, realizing with astonishment that they couldn’t even see through a bird in the temple?</p><p>After composing himself, Yu Chenghuang picked up a skewer, sniffed it lightly, and, imitating Qin Sang, bit directly into a piece of meat.  He had come from a scholarly family, raised with strict rules, and this rough manner of eating was unprecedented and somewhat uncomfortable.</p><p>Chen Xiucai initially felt the same, but quickly got used to it and even praised this method of eating, declaring that this was the only way to enjoy it.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang savored the taste.</p><p>Chen Xiucai watched him swallow, then said smugly, “Brother Yu, how was it?  I wasn’t exaggerating, was I?”</p><p>“It’s heavenly!”</p><p>Yu Chenghuang didn't hesitate with his praise.</p><p>“Even the Drunken Fragrance Feast of the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant, renowned throughout the south, can’t compare to this simple skewer of meat.”</p><p>Yi Panguan agreed, but inwardly scoffed, thinking, *Of course it's delicious, considering what it's made of.*</p><p>He glanced at the mortals in the room.  They had eaten so much potent spirit medicine and fruit without exploding, clearly the temple master had secretly used some method to allow them to slowly digest the medicinal power, at least strengthening their bodies for life.</p><p>“What’s the Drunken Fragrance Feast?” Chen Xiucai was surprised. He had been to the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant many times but had never heard of such a feast.</p><p>“The owner of the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant was once an imperial chef.  Rumor has it he offended some powerful people in the palace and was forced to retire, returning to Jian County to open the restaurant. Only the owner can prepare the Drunken Fragrance Feast, and there are no successors. The owner is old, and only prepares it a few times a year, only for close friends,” Yu Chenghuang took a sip of wine, savoring the combined flavors of wine, meat, and herbs.</p><p>“Another hermit! Jian County truly deserves the title of City/County of Hermits!  Let’s drink to that!”</p><p>Chen Xiucai, overcome with excitement, suddenly slammed his fist on the table and drained his cup. He drank several more cups, his behavior becoming increasingly unrestrained.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang glanced at Qin Sang, silently agreeing. “Since it’s the County of Hermits, it’s also a place where dragons lie hidden. Brother Chen, you should be coming out of seclusion next year for the autumn examinations, shouldn’t you?”</p><p>As the City God of Jian County, Yu Chenghuang also paid attention to the local scholars and knew that Chen Xiucai was quite learned, but unfortunately, despite his talent, he had repeatedly failed the examinations.</p><p>Chen Xiucai gave a wry smile. “In my youth, I was arrogant and boastful, yet I repeatedly failed the exams. Seeing my classmates all achieve success, I only pretended to be aloof and unconventional—it was just a mask to hide my shame. I was never a true hermit; there’s no such thing as me ‘coming out of seclusion.’”</p><p>“With such a mindset, I believe Brother Chen will one day achieve your goals,” Qin Sang raised her cup to Chen Xiucai. The others drank with her.</p><p>No one offered words of comfort; Chen Xiucai’s willingness to expose his weaknesses showed that he didn't need any consolation.</p><p>Chen Xiucai accepted it calmly, stood up, and looked out the window.  “In my youthful arrogance, I loved to speak boldly…”</p><p>He no longer yearned for titles or fame etched in history.  If fortune granted him a successful career, governing a region, he would only strive to serve the people, the Emperor, and live up to the expectations of Heaven and his own conscience.</p><p>…</p><p>The Qingyang Temple pavilion buzzed with lively conversation.</p><p>The town of Jien was bustling with activity.</p><p>The teahouse should have been even livelier than the streets.</p><p>Yet, when the girl entered, she sensed an unusual stillness.  Everyone was engrossed in the storyteller’s tale.</p><p>The tea server moved with exceptional quietude, pouring tea with utmost care, avoiding any disturbance.</p><p>Patrons rarely spoke, seemingly forgetting their food and drink.</p><p>Only when the storyteller struck the sounding block did the audience awaken, their conversations resuming, yet their voices remained as soft as whispers.</p><p>The storyteller’s voice resonated throughout the teahouse, seemingly silencing the outside noise.</p><p>“What story holds such captivating power?”</p><p>The girl, amazed by this scene, peered past the patrons toward the storyteller on stage.</p><p>As the woman outside had described, he wore a simple gray robe, appeared young, of average height and looks; the kind of person easily overlooked in a crowd.</p><p>The storyteller noticed the girl entering and smiled gently, nodding in greeting.</p><p>She returned a smile.</p><p>A tea server approached with a teapot; after a brief exchange of glances, he led the girl to an empty table.</p><p>“As the Celestial Maiden descended to earth, the Heavenly Mother dispatched a blue bird with a message, secretly instructing it, should the Maiden prove obstinate, to use magic to take her to the Heavenly Lake. Unexpectedly, the blue bird, longing for earthly life, was easily persuaded by the Maiden and descended with her…”</p><p>It was a mythological story.</p><p>The girl, led to her seat by the tea server, didn't notice her pet bird, perched on her shoulder, tilting its head and fluttering its wings at the mention of the blue bird.</p><p>“Tweet…tweet…”</p><p>The bird flew, tirelessly circling, its blue feathers shedding a shimmering dust. Its chirps blended seamlessly with the storyteller's narrative, embodying the blue bird of the story, immersing the audience in the tale.</p><p>No one, including the girl, found it strange.</p><p>The girl, oblivious to her companions, focused entirely on the storyteller, captivated by the compelling narrative.</p><p>In a trance, she felt as if she had become the Celestial Maiden.  Her teacher was the harsh Heavenly Mother.</p><p>Every action, every encounter of the Maiden touched her heart.</p><p>She laughed with joy when the Maiden rejoiced, and wept when she grieved.</p><p>…</p><p>The girl forgot she was in the teahouse, oblivious to her surroundings, lost in the world the storyteller had created.</p><p>Shortly after the girl’s arrival, a chilling wind swept past the teahouse door, and a shadow flickered, revealing a figure invisible to ordinary eyes.</p><p>This figure, clad in armor, was a deity from the Jien City God's retinue, holding a high rank, second only to the City God and the judges, on par with the other officials and commanders: the Day-巡遊神 (Daytime Patrol Deity).</p><p>“She’s inside?”</p><p>Two underworld constables stood where the Day Patrol Deity appeared; they bowed in unison, confirming.</p><p>The girl must have used some method to conceal her presence; she evaded the constables guarding the city gate but was detected by the divine artifacts within the City God temple.</p><p>Unfortunately, the higher officials were absent.</p><p>The City God and the Judge of the Underworld were out on patrol, while the Martial Judge led troops out of the city to hunt a demon.</p><p>Unable to ascertain the girl’s identity, the Day Patrol Deity and other officials dared not act rashly.  Seeing her innocent and playful demeanor, they decided the Day Patrol Deity should leave to inform the Martial Judge.</p><p>Two underworld soldiers waited.</p><p>“Yes, she entered the teahouse and hasn't left,” one constable hesitated, “It feels…odd inside. My lord, perhaps you should look yourself.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The Day Patrol Deity frowned, leading the two constables through the doorway.  The storyteller had just reached the part where the Celestial Maiden faced danger.</p><p>“The Heavenly Mother dispatched celestial soldiers to search the land. No matter how cautious the Celestial Maiden and the blue bird were, they couldn’t escape.  On Lianyang Mountain, they were finally discovered by a squad of heavenly soldiers. Poor Celestial Maiden and the blue bird; the seal of their ascension hadn’t yet been lifted, their powers restored to only 30%, and they were about to face another fierce battle…”</p><p>The bird had returned to the girl's shoulder, as engrossed in the story as its owner, its expression showing great anxiety.</p><p>The Day Patrol Deity and the two constables, having just entered the teahouse, were startled when the storyteller nodded towards them.</p><p>At that moment, a surge of righteous indignation filled them.  They felt as if they had transformed into celestial soldiers, dispatched by the Heavenly Mother to apprehend criminals and mete out divine justice!</p><p>They completely forgot the purpose of their visit, and sat down at another empty table, their backs ramrod straight, their eyes gleaming with determination.</p><p>The story continued.</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang and Yi Pan Guan at the Qingyang Temple knew nothing of this.</p><p>The feast lasted from morning until afternoon.</p><p>Doctor Liu stayed overnight at the Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Chen Xiucai and Yu Cheng Huang and the others descended the mountain together. They parted ways at the edge of the bamboo forest.</p><p>Chen Xiucai offered them a ride in his carriage, but Yu and Yi declined.</p><p>After parting, the two deities vanished and reappeared in a mountain not far from the temple.</p><p>"Greetings to your lordships."</p><p>A local earth deity, who had been waiting there, quickly paid his respects.</p><p>Yi Pan Guan said, "We've met the Qingfeng Daoist. He's no ordinary person.  Be careful in your dealings with him, carry out any requests promptly, and don't disturb him unnecessarily."</p><p>The earth deity was startled. "May I ask, my lords, what is this Daoist's background?"</p><p>Yi Pan Guan looked at Yu Cheng Huang.  Earlier, for some reason, Yu Cheng Huang hadn't inquired about it.</p><p>"Even the highest officials in the prefecture would treat him with respect.  This man's seclusion in Jinyang County… it's hard to say whether it's a blessing or a curse."</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang sighed, "Regardless of his identity or cultivation, consider him a powerful being who merely plays amongst mortals."</p><p>The earth deity replied with a confused "Yes."</p><p>Yi Pan Guan glanced at the earth deity and said gravely, "With such a person, everything depends on fate.  Before the time is right, everything is illusion.  Don't think that diligent service will bring you any benefit; be careful not to overdo it."</p><p>The earth deity, his thoughts exposed, shuddered. "Thank you, my lord, for your warning. I almost made a grave mistake."</p><p>"No need to be so cautious. I find this person's nature easygoing. Just let things be," Yu Cheng Huang added a few more instructions, then departed with Yi Pan Guan back to the county.</p><p>…</p><p>"What did you say? The Day and Night You Shen and the Ghost Catchers are trapped in a teahouse?"</p><p>When Yu Cheng Huang and Yi Pan Guan returned to the county, Wu Pan Guan also happened to be returning from apprehending a demon.  They were about to combine their forces when they received a message via spirit talisman.</p><p>Upon seeing the contents of the talisman, the three officials’ faces turned pale.</p><p>It turned out that the Day You Shen had disappeared after entering the teahouse, and the Night You Shen and the Ghost Catchers, who went looking for him, were also trapped inside.</p><p>Then, several more officials from various departments were also trapped.</p><p>The teahouse door seemed like a gaping maw, with no ghosts or gods returning.</p><p>More and more spirits were drawn in, until finally, some underworld officials noticed something was wrong.</p><p>"Preposterous! I want to see which demon dares to act so recklessly within the county!"</p><p>Wu Pan Guan flew into a rage, swept his sleeve, and all the ghost soldiers transformed into a gust of dark wind, rushing towards the teahouse.</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang and Yi Pan Guan exchanged glances, seeing the same worry in each other's eyes.</p><p>How could this be such a coincidence?</p><p>Just as they were visiting Qingfeng Daoist, something happened in the city.</p><p>By this time, the teahouse was surrounded by layers of underworld officials, using magic to isolate it from the mortal world.</p><p>The mortals were unaware of this; the streets were still bustling, but people instinctively avoided the teahouse.</p><p>A storyteller's booming voice could be heard, narrating the tale of Nine Celestial Maidens and a Green Bird being pursued by celestial soldiers.</p><p>The chase was thrilling and captivating.</p><p>All the spirits in the city were present, yet none dared to step into the teahouse.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A dark wind descended from the sky. Yu Cheng Huang and the two judges finally arrived. After receiving a report from their subordinates, they went to the teahouse.</p><p>The door curtain was made of bamboo. Through the gaps, they could vaguely see the inside.</p><p>A young woman, a Green Bird, and a host of spirits, each with different expressions, were completely immersed in the story.</p><p>"Deploy the Town Mountain Spirit Banner!"</p><p>Wu Pan Guan whispered.</p><p>Outside the teahouse, a team of spirits received the order and went to fetch nine three-zhang-tall black banners, which they erected around the teahouse.</p><p>The spirits were divided into nine teams, gathered under the banners, with the main banner behind Wu Pan Guan.</p><p>Nine banners formed an array to subdue all immortals, cultivators, and demons!</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang nodded to Yi Pan Guan, who stepped forward and lifted the door curtain, but did not cross the threshold.</p><p>The curtain was half-raised.</p><p>The three officials saw the storyteller, and at the same time, the storyteller looked up.</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The storyteller suddenly struck his sounding block. "The celestial soldiers were driven back by the Nine Celestial Maidens' clever strategy, suffering a great defeat. Just as the Nine Celestial Maidens and the Green Bird were celebrating, they were unaware that danger was approaching! Three Star Lords have already led their troops to pursue them; this calamity will be difficult to overcome!"</p><p>…</p><p>Fire Domain Dojo.</p><p>Qin Sang's true form was comprehending a sword formation when he suddenly awoke, gazing south, his expression gradually turning grave.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, left his cave, informed Gui Hou, and vanished using thunder escape.
