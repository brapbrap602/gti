Chapter 559: The Eight Sects' Secrets


Patriarch Dongyang, Daoist Chongyi, and Ironcrown soared away from the Jade Ruyi, flying towards Patriarch Chifa and the others.
The Jade Ruyi carried the remaining cultivators to the red cloud-shrouded peak. After setting everyone down, it shrunk back to its original size and shot into the sky, retrieved by Daoist Chongyi.
On the peak, numerous crude stone platforms, large and small, had been carved out. Most were already occupied.
Everyone chose a platform and waited quietly. Qin Sang, noticing that Wanderer wasn't far away, hopped onto his platform and quietly inquired about the identities of the three who had accompanied Patriarch Chifa.
As expected, all three were Nascent Soul Patriarchs of the Eight Righteous Sects.
The only woman among the three, dressed in palace attire, was Patriarch Binghan of the Ethereal Spirit Sect.  She was renowned not only for her high cultivation but also for her exceptional skill in crafting magical tools, unrivaled in the Xiao Han Region.
While Daoist Chongyi was the sole Nascent Soul Patriarch of the Taiyi Pill Sect, his alchemy skills were said to be inferior to the pill-obsessed elders within his sect. In contrast, Binghan had fully inherited her sect's legacy, proving herself to be a true master.
Another, who appeared remarkably young with a jade-like face and elegant demeanor, resembling a nobleman, was Leng Yuntian, the current Sect Master of the Yuan Mirage Sect.
"So that's what Leng Yuntian looks like."  Qin Sang thought to himself, glancing involuntarily at Granny Jing in the distance.
Granny Jing occupied a platform alone, eyes closed in meditation, seemingly oblivious to the world.
Knowing he would be working with Granny Jing to deal with Leng Yuntian in the Violet Firmament Palace, Qin Sang couldn't afford for her to fail; the consequences for him would be dire.
He wanted to learn more about Leng Yuntian, but Wanderer knew little about him.  He seemed more familiar with Leng Qian, the previous Sect Master of the Yuan Mirage Sect.
Leng Yuntian was said to be Leng Qian's adopted son and disciple.  Leng Qian, a formidable figure in his own right, whose cultivation was comparable to Patriarch Chifa, had died unexpectedly over a century ago, causing quite a stir in the Xiao Han Region cultivation world.
Fortunately, Leng Yuntian proved to be a worthy successor, ensuring the Yuan Mirage Sect maintained its position among the Eight Righteous Sects.
The Yuan Mirage Sect's Elder Zhangxing and Golden Core cultivator Yu Shanting had died on Pointing Heaven Peak.
Later, preoccupied with his Nascent Soul formation, Qin Sang had only paid sporadic attention to the Yuan Mirage Sect's movements. There had been no news of Leng Yuntian openly seeking revenge for his elder.
Having suffered such a significant loss, Leng Yuntian was unlikely to let it go. However, since he had initiated the conflict at Pointing Heaven Peak, he probably didn't dare to publicize his investigation and could only pursue it discreetly.
The last person, a middle-aged man in black, with a stern face and imposing aura, was the Sect Master of the Wuji Sect.
Seeing the Wuji Sect Master again, Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the mysterious Nascent Soul cultivator who wielded the Black Tortoise Shell in Boundless Valley.
The two had concealed their identities and infiltrated Boundless Valley together. Their purpose remained unknown, but they had somehow provoked the Thunder Swallowing Falcon, engaging it in a fierce battle that they failed to win.
"Senior, have you heard of any Nascent Soul cultivator whose magical tool is a Black Tortoise Shell in recent years?" Qin Sang transmitted his question.
Wanderer, who also remembered the incident, though he hadn't witnessed the battle against the Thunder Swallowing Falcon, connected it with the Shadowless Sword technique used to kill the Starvenom Toad. His expression shifted, and he looked at Qin Sang with surprise.
"Are you suspecting..."
Qin Sang nodded slightly.
Wanderer pondered for a moment, then shook his head. "It definitely isn't any of our Righteous Patriarchs! Some of the rogue cultivators at Yin Mountain Pass and the Nascent Soul Patriarchs among the demonic cultivators are quite mysterious. It's likely one of them.  Nascent Soul Patriarchs aren't bound by the so-called righteous-demonic divide. It's not unusual for them to have connections across factions. I have a few friends in the demonic path myself."
Qin Sang was merely curious. Seeing that Wanderer had no further information, he didn't pursue the matter.
Then he suddenly realized that, including Ironcrown, the Palace Master of the Supreme Clarity Palace, only seven Nascent Soul Patriarchs of the Eight Righteous Sects were present. The Sect Master of the Spirit Control Sect was missing.
When Qin Sang inquired, Wanderer replied cryptically, "During my travels to the Heavenly Yao Mound, I observed some signs that suggest a rather intriguing relationship between the Spirit Control Sect and the Heavenly Yao Mound. This sect, since its establishment, has consistently remained among the top sects of the Righteous Path. The secrets behind this are likely known only to Nascent Soul Patriarchs."
...
The red cloud blocked the spiritual tide.
After talking with Wanderer for a while, Qin Sang returned to his platform to wait.  Bored, he began mentally reviewing the treasures within his iron finger ring.
Under the watchful eye of his sect's patriarch, Qin Sang planned to present the Cold Gold Sword and the two talisman treasures from Daoist Jiupao's legacy as his primary assets. For a pseudo-Nascent Soul cultivator, this should appear more than respectable.
Among his trump cards, the Void Thunder and the Ebony Sword were the least risky to reveal. After all, with his increased cultivation, acquiring such treasures through fortuitous encounters was plausible.
Patriarch Dongyang, a Nascent Soul grandmaster, wouldn't be interested in them.
As for the rest, it was best to keep them concealed.
The Nine Dragon Chariot Talisman was linked to the missing Daoist Xuanyu of the Supreme Clarity Palace.
The Ten Yama Banners held immense significance.
The Flying Night Devil and the Corpse Core were both related to the "Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture," a demonic corpse cultivation technique.  Since Patriarch Dongyang tolerated Chenyan's use of dual cultivation to achieve Nascent Soul, he probably wasn't overly concerned with righteousness.  Still, Qin Sang preferred to avoid unnecessary complications.
Mentally reviewing his plans for the Violet Firmament Palace, Qin Sang realized the multitude of tasks awaiting him, each crucial and demanding precision, and felt the immense pressure.
He waited there for several hours, but the Nascent Soul Patriarchs still hadn't announced their departure.
Just as everyone was growing impatient, a powerful aura suddenly appeared in the west.  Everyone felt it and rose to look. They saw a mass of multicolored mist drifting towards them with astonishing speed.
Demonic energy surged from within the mist!
"The demon cultivators from the Heavenly Yao Mound have arrived!" someone shouted.
The swirling mist obscured the number of demon cultivators within, but looming, non-human shapes were faintly visible.
It appeared that not only Transformation stage great demons were present, but also numerous Core Formation stage demonic beasts.
Great demons were rarely seen in the Xiao Han Region.
Most of the cultivators present were fascinated.  It was their first time seeing so many demon cultivators together. These beings, undoubtedly empowered by the Emperor Flow Nectar, possessed intelligence and magical powers comparable to human cultivators.
Just as everyone was discussing this, Patriarch Chifa's voice echoed in their ears.  "Fellow Daoists from the Heavenly Yao Mound have arrived.  We depart now."
The red cloud suddenly descended.
Everyone felt a tightening sensation, and when they recovered, they found themselves enveloped within the red cloud.
Several figures had materialized at the edge of the cloudâ€”Patriarch Chifa and the others.
Simultaneously, the multicolored demon mist, black demonic energy, and the golden palace converged on the red cloud. The red cloud was the largest, followed by the demonic energy, with the golden palace appearing the smallest.
Distinct in color, they clung together, forming a four-colored cloud mass that shot towards the inner regions of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.
