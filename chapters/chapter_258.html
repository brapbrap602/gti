Chapter 251: Black Flame Camphor

The majority of the famous and well-known disciples of the Shadowfiend Sect had been killed by the Yuanzhao Sect, leaving only a few survivors.

The sole surviving Core Formation cultivator had lost his physical body, his Golden Core had been heavily damaged, and his strength had been greatly diminished. He dared not show his face, and it would be impossible for him to recover in a short period of time.

This was good news for Qin Sang. The towering mountain that was the Shadowfiend Sect had finally been removed from his mind.

But while the Shadowfiend Sect was only a potential threat for the future, the Earth Deficiency Old Monster was a pressing danger that was close at hand.

"How would you like to have the Heart-Eating Insect Gu removed and regain your freedom?"

The Earth Deficiency Old Man's tone was full of enticement.

Qin Sang asked in return, "Senior, can you help me to remove the Gu? Are you willing to help me to remove the Gu?"

When he said the word "willing," his tone suddenly became heavy.

The Earth Deficiency Old Man smiled and said, "Although this old servant cannot remove the Gu worm that the Shadowfiend Ancestor personally created, I do have ways to conceal the Gu worm and prevent others from sensing it. At that time, even the people of the Shadowfiend Sect would not be able to control the Gu worm in your Sea of Consciousness. Moreover, this old servant has no friendship with the Shadowfiend Sect. Although you schemed against this old servant, you helped this old servant find the Flaming Jade Centipede and steal the Crimson Goldenfruit. This old servant should thank you, so we can call it even. But more than that, this old servant actually admires you. With a mind like yours, you can help this old servant achieve great things. As long as you work diligently, why would this old servant be unwilling to help you?"

Qin Sang's eyes flashed as he sneered, "Just now, Senior said that the Shadowfiend Sect had already been exterminated. In that case, if you cannot remove the Gu, then merely shielding the Gu worm would not seem to be very useful for me. If there is something that Senior wants me to do, just say it directly. There is no need to use such high-sounding words to pretend that this is a fair trade."

"You don't want this old man to tell Che Yutao about your identity, do you? Although the Shadowfiend Sect is gone, Shaohua Mountain will certainly not allow a traitor of a demonic sect like you to enter their sect, as it would be a disgrace to their reputation. The best way would be to execute you directly and erase all traces of you. Che Yutao, that old devil, is not a merciful person..."

A face full of smiles appeared on the Earth Deficiency Old Man's face, but it sent a chill down Qin Sang's spine.

"However, this old servant is not an elder of Shaohua Mountain. Why would this old servant help them to find a traitor and do such a thankless task?"

The Earth Deficiency Old Man's tone changed, "As the saying goes, 'coercion and enticement.' The thing that this old servant is most unwilling to do is to use threats to force people to submit. It is only with benefits that one can create a solid foundation. Only then will you be able to work with all your heart. How about this? I see that your Natal Sword has some potential. It is actually a pure wooden embryo. Do you need spirit wood to increase the power of your flying sword?"

"Senior has good eyes."

The Ebony Sword was too special, so it was normal for the Earth Deficiency Old Man to have seen through it.

Qin Sang sneered in his heart. He did not believe a single word of the Earth Deficiency Old Man's words. Even if he promised him great benefits, they were nothing more than empty promises. He had to find a way to escape this predicament.

It would be best if he could kill the Earth Deficiency Old Man.

But the gap between a Foundation Establishment cultivator and a Core Formation cultivator was like that between the heavens and the earth. Qin Sang did not dare to even think about it.

The second option was to first break free from the Earth Deficiency Old Man's control, and then flee elsewhere or find a sufficiently hidden place to hide before the Earth Deficiency Old Man could expose his identity to Shaohua Mountain.

The depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the Chaoslands, would be a good hiding place, but it was too dangerous. Apart from that, since the fate of the Shadowfiend Sect had come to an end, he could hide in the sphere of influence of a demonic sect and become a rogue cultivator.

He had not done anything to harm Shaohua Mountain, so Shaohua Mountain would probably not openly enter the sphere of influence of the demonic sect to search for him. It should not be difficult for him to hide.

The only pity was that he would lose the resources of Shaohua Mountain and many of his conveniences.

However, compared to Qi Condensation cultivators, Foundation Establishment cultivators were considered to be experts in the Xiuxian world. They had the ability to venture out on their own in the Xiuxian world and accumulate their own cultivation resources through their own efforts.

It was something that he could accept.

But this was impossible to do in the封闭 ancient cultivator's legacy, so he had to leave the legacy and find a suitable opportunity to do so.

...

The Earth Deficiency Old Man nodded and used a jade bottle to store the remaining Crimson Fire Gold Liquid. Then, he put it away as if it were a treasure, being extremely careful.

He then took out a section of black spirit wood and showed it to Qin Sang.

The spirit wood was as black as charcoal, and there were complex wood grain patterns on it that formed flame-like flower patterns. It was very strange.

"This is Black Flame Camphor. This old servant just obtained it from a restriction."

Black Flame Camphor was even more precious than Golden Silk Snow Fir Wood. If the Ebony Sword swallowed this section of Black Flame Camphor, it would definitely be able to withstand the second Killing Rune.

When one was fighting for one's life, one would learn Killing Runes much faster.

Qin Sang was about to grasp the second killing spell and after this trial and repeated entries into the magma lake, and fighting the Flame Flying Apes, he already comprehended it entirely. 
Staying in the cave and cultivating hard from then on, it would have been possible for him to break through the mid Foundation Establishment in 20 years without any setbacks, given his talent. 
If the quality of the Ebony Wood Sword was not good enough, he would have to find some spirit wood outside. With the Infernal Camphor Wood, he would not have to worry any longer. 
“Come with me now to do something. Once it’s half done, I’ll give you the Infernal Camphor Wood. When it’s all done, there’ll be more rewards,” Old Man Dique tossed the Infernal Camphor Wood and said in a bewitching voice. 
“Do I have other options?” 
Qin Sang was silent for a long time and said with a bitter smile, “May I know what I should do?” 
“Follow me and you’ll know in a moment.” 
The old man looked back at the magma sea and walked towards the ground. 
The spirit fruit was stolen and the ape pack in the magma lake became furious. They attacked the barrier ragefully, with the aim of tearing Qin Sang and the old man into pieces. The barrier actually seemed to tremble under their relentless attack. 
Qin Sang hurried after him, flying out of the ancient well and through the water mirror. 
Just when the old man in front was about to walk out of the illusion formation, he suddenly made a sound of surprise, as if something unexpected had happened. 
“Why is that old woman outside?” 
Old Man Dique paused, with an uncertain expression on his face, and suddenly started to curse. He clearly hated that person so much that Qin Sang felt perplexed. 
Then the old man waved his hand suddenly and shot out several streams of spiritual qi, hiding both their breaths and figures before he walked out of the illusion formation. 
In the distant sky, there was an enormous yin-yang symbol between the peaks. 
More than 10 figures stood above the yin-yang symbol, and they were all disciples from various sects who were in the ancient cultivator’s legacy. Among these people was a woman dressed in a silky gown. 
She stood right at the center of the yin-yang symbol with an imposing manner no less inferior to Old Man Dique. She was one of the five Nascent Soul Stage cultivators, Sikong Muyue! 
The others followed a certain rule, standing in various positions of the yin-yang symbol around Sikong Muyue. 
Spiritual qi was surging out of the bodies of these people and being infused into the yin-yang symbol, causing the black and white qi on the yin-yang symbol to become even thicker. Suddenly, the yin-yang symbol trembled, and innumerable black and white qi turned into two dragons that swooped down with the might of heaven and earth. 
In an instant, the black and white qi hit the barrier on the mountaintop below. 
‘Boom!’ 
The barrier released seven-colored divine light to resist the impact of the black and white qi. Eventually, it could no longer hold its ground. The light became increasingly faint and was broken through by the black and white qi.
