<h1>Chapter 2111: Illusory Domain</h1><p>The Heaven-Binding Golden Lock, imprisoning heaven and earth!</p><p>Qin Sang was also trapped within.</p><p>He couldn't help but recall the time he saved Si Lu, encountering a powerful being from another race.</p><p>That person, possessing late-stage Void Refinement Realm cultivation, was just a step away from the Saint Realm – the equivalent of the Unity stage.  Their true form was far away, yet they could somehow project their will across vast distances, wielding the might of heaven and earth to suppress him, showcasing the immense difference between cultivators at this level.</p><p>Qin Sang still remembered the feeling of being crushed by the heavens and earth. He had summoned his Dharma Body and Dharma Image, utilizing the Sun Wheel Seal with all his might to break free from that overwhelming pressure.</p><p>Now, he felt that same sensation again, even more intensely, sending shivers down his spine.</p><p>The golden lock hung high, its golden light scattering.</p><p>Wherever the golden light reached, it seemed to transform into the lock's domain, the ambient spiritual energy imprisoned.  When Qin Sang tried to control the surrounding spiritual energy, he found it several times more difficult than before. Even the spiritual energy he had already controlled was showing signs of being restrained.</p><p>A fight between Void Refinement cultivators, simply put, is sometimes like two strong men in a tug-of-war, with the ambient spiritual energy being the rope.</p><p>But now, Qin Sang's opponent was like an unyielding wall. Not only could he not gain any advantage, but the opponent's power was encroaching, seizing his control over the spiritual energy, even attempting to imprison his very being!</p><p>The man in white let out a cold smile.</p><p>After a cultivator enters the Void Refinement Realm, their cultivation improvement primarily manifests as increased control over the power of heaven and earth.  The first level allows them to harness the might of heaven and earth, then control the spiritual energy. Legend has it that after breaking through to the Saint Realm, one becomes a part of heaven and earth themselves – a monumental transformation!</p><p>Among the various races of the Great Thousand World, regardless of the name of the realm, this ability has a universally recognized term – Dharma Domain.</p><p>Within the Dharma Domain, 'I' am the sovereign, able to do as I please.</p><p>Heaven and earth are me, and I am heaven and earth!</p><p>The Saint Realm Dharma Domain is incredibly profound, even the Grand Protector only understands its effects, not its underlying principles.</p><p>It is said that after reaching the late-stage of the second Void Refinement Realm, some, through exceptional luck or innate talent, can gain a glimpse of the Dharma Domain's mysteries ahead of time, greatly benefiting their future breakthrough.</p><p>Although what they grasp is merely a superficial understanding, if they comprehend the art of projecting their will, it will significantly enhance their combat abilities. However, it's not a true Dharma Domain, only an Illusory Domain.</p><p>Those who can comprehend the Illusory Domain are all top-tier powerhouses.</p><p>Before leaving, when the Grand Protector handed him the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock, he mentioned that this treasure could mimic some of the power of a Dharma Domain, indicating its immense might.</p><p>In his hands, its power is significantly reduced compared to when wielded by the Grand Protector, but even facing someone like Xia Changshi, he could use it to hold his own and escape.</p><p>Against a mere early-stage Void Refinement cultivator, it's more than enough!</p><p>Watching Qin Sang surrounded by the golden light, unable to move, the golden sun above his head losing its brilliance and dimming, the man in white smiled with satisfaction. With a flick of his hand, he made a gesture, directing it towards the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock.</p><p>The sky and sea were one, dazzling golden light forming a domain of golden light.</p><p>Everything in this region was frozen – the wind ceased, the waves solidified mid-air, their surfaces seeming coated in gold leaf.</p><p>On the edge of the golden light domain, an island reef, luckily untouched by the brunt of the battle, also fell into absolute silence, with no sound from insects or beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang, at the very center of the golden light domain, deeply felt the overwhelming power of the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock.</p><p>The ambient spiritual energy was receding, and if it continued, he might eventually have only himself to rely on. But how could one person contend with heaven and earth? Struggling would be futile; the outcome seemed predetermined.</p><p>For anyone else, the most sensible course of action would be to escape the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock at all costs, then consider other options.</p><p>At this critical moment, however, Qin Sang seemed somewhat absent-minded, his thoughts on the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The reason Qin Sang found the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock familiar was that after his breakthrough to the Void Refinement Realm, he had the opportunity, through the "Purple Micro Sword Scripture" and Elder Tian Yue, to experience a true Dharma Domain.</p><p>The Dharma Domain was supremely profound; Qin Sang's comprehension was extremely difficult, yielding little results, yet greatly broadened his horizons. Therefore, when the man in white summoned the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock, Qin Sang immediately saw through its power.</p><p>If his Dharma Body and Dharma Image were both present, along with the Five Elements Crown, he would not fear this treasure.  Unfortunately, only his Dharma Image was here.  However, Qin Sang remained calm, his mind connected to the Sky Eye Butterfly, commanding it to unleash a new ability – the Illusory Profound Divine Light.</p><p>He shimmered with a faint light, his form seeming both real and illusory.  With a slight movement, like a fish gliding through water, he swam through the golden light, appearing at its edge in a flash.</p><p>This was the true power of the Xuanhuan Divine Light!</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed.  He had instinctively tried it, and effortlessly escaped the golden light domain.</p><p>This meant that with the help of the Tianmu Butterfly, cultivators at the late Nascent Soul stage would no longer be able to suppress him with their superior cultivation.</p><p>Of course, the Tianmu Butterfly's cultivation was still too low.  Against a true Dharma Realm, it would likely be ineffective.</p><p>But it was clear that as their cultivation continued to improve, one day they might even stand a chance against a Unity stage cultivator!</p><p>The Xuanhuan Divine Light brought Qin Sang joy, but the man in white felt shock and horror.  He didn't understand how Qin Sang had done it.  Logically, only someone who had broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage would have the ability to resist the Sky-Trapping Golden Lock.</p><p>To move so freely, as easily as Qin Sang did, was something only a powerful cultivator who had comprehended a Void Realm divine ability could achieve.  A Nascent Soul stage cultivator comprehending a Void Realm divine ability was simply too incredible to believe!</p><p>The man in white preferred to believe that Qin Sang had been forced to use a trump card, a life-saving technique that couldn't be replicated.</p><p>But he wouldn't risk his life to test it. The longer he waited, the worse the situation would become.  Failing to control the Sky-Trapping Golden Lock meant he had lost his last chance, making it impossible to kill Qin Sang and escape as planned.</p><p>Therefore, there was no point in lingering.</p><p>The man in white acted decisively.  Seeing Qin Sang "swim" out of the golden light, he didn't bother to investigate how, instead changing his hand seals.  His figure and the Sky-Trapping Golden Lock simultaneously turned illusory.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and multicolored light appeared beside him. He had kept the Five Elements Crown on his person, allowing him to boldly pursue.  The Crown appeared, and a beam of Reverse Five Elements Divine Light shot out, striking the man in white in the chest.</p><p>The Reverse Five Elements Divine Light was designed to kill, and the man in white was instantly annihilated, leaving no trace.</p><p>The golden light receded like a tide, and the Sky-Trapping Golden Lock disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the spot where the man in white had vanished, knowing he had successfully escaped.  This battle showed only three of his companion beasts; the fourth was certainly hidden in the distance, allowing for instantaneous switching between his true body and beast form.</p><p>Among all the tribes of the Yi people, the Siyou tribe was one of the hardest to kill.  Years ago, Xia Changshi and Siliu were both severely injured.  The Quanfeng tribe gathered several powerful cultivators to pursue them, but the Siyou repeatedly evaded capture.  Only after Elder Quan was brought in did they manage to corner them—and Qin Sang still found a way to slip away.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't angry about the enemy's escape, nor did he pursue. He closed his eyes slowly, reviewing the events.</p><p>After a moment, the sea surface churned, a strong wind blew, and a shadowy figure formed in the air, taking the shape of Qin Sang's Dharma body.</p><p>At the same time that Qin Sang's main body sensed something was amiss, his Dharma body at Qingyang Temple also acted. Dharma bodies can use teleportation formations, making them almost as fast as their main body. But Qin Sang didn't choose to have them join forces to attack the man in white.</p><p>Siyou cultivators were exceedingly difficult to kill. Though Qin Sang had the Sword Heart Technique, which could locate his target through any connection, allowing him to kill from a distance, the technique was more effective for killing. If the man in white sensed danger and switched with his beast, the Sword Heart Technique could only wound him, not kill him.</p><p>Therefore, when the Dharma body arrived, it did not join the battle but instead searched for the man in white's fourth companion beast, but to no avail.</p><p>The Dharma body returned without success, and joined with his main body to return to Xitu.  The Dharma body then returned alone to Qingyang Temple to guard the main altar, while Qin Sang’s main body went to the Canglang Sea to see Siliu.</p><p>To guard against a feint, Qin Sang had warned Siliu to be vigilant without asking him to come to his aid.</p><p>Canglang Sea.</p><p>Siliu was stationed at the central altar.  Sensing Qin Sang's arrival, he opened the restriction, allowing Qin Sang to enter the spirit island.  Qin Sang recounted what had happened.</p><p>After listening, Siliu said gravely, "That person must be Lu Gan, the top general under Lord Lu. He is highly skilled, courageous, and Lord Lu’s right-hand man, favored by Lu family’s high priest."</p><p>Siliu’s feelings were mixed. Lu Gan acting as a secret agent meant the Lu family was fully committed.  He would now be firmly tied to Qin Sang’s fate.</p><p>But the enemy's arrival had been too swift, making the situation incredibly urgent. Siliu wondered how much of a chance Qin Sang had.</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "This person is indeed audacious.  His identity exposed, instead of fleeing, he tried to kill me."</p><p>"Brother Qin, are you injured?" Si Lu asked with concern.</p><p>He knew Qin Sang's strength was comparable to Lu Qian's, but only his true form and a manifestation guarded the Western Lands.</p><p>"Uninjured, but I didn't manage to capture him. He only accessed information about some branch temples before I discovered him.  I don't know how much else he learned. However, the Lu family will surely not let us build the altar smoothly; they'll likely attack soon,"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone turned serious.  He mentally calculated the time, considering any delaying tactics.</p><p>"If the Lu family attacks, we must consult with the Zhu Yan tribe. Otherwise, if the Zhu Yan tribe considers it an offense, it won't be something easily resolved with mere interests; the Lu family certainly wouldn't dare provoke them.  When we visited Daoist Yuan Miao, there was no sign of this, suggesting they might have only recently begun their involvement. We still have time," Si Lu said, his expression growing increasingly grave.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang changed the subject, "How is the refinement of that treasure coming along, Daoist friend?"</p><p>The Lu family army would likely be the first enemy after the thunder altar's completion.</p><p>Si You tribe masters were all skilled in life-saving techniques.</p><p>There was only one chance to eliminate the Lu family's grand protector.  Qin Sang didn't want his first activation of the thunder altar to be fruitless.  Ideally, he wanted to both deter the wicked and gain significant benefits.</p><p>The best outcome, it seemed, would be to eliminate the Lu family, help Si Lu return to the Si You tribe, and reclaim his rightful place as king!</p><p>Qin Sang only needed to prevent the Lu family's grand protector from escaping the moment the Thunder Oath exploded.</p><p>No one understood Si You tribe techniques better than the Si You people themselves.  Earlier, Si Lu mentioned that King Yan and Xia Changshi had left him a treasure capable of countering the mutual transformation technique.</p><p>Unfortunately, this treasure was extremely difficult to refine. Even in King Yan's hands, countless rare treasures were consumed, yet it remained unfinished. Since Si Lu's foundation had become stable, he had been quietly refining it, but it still needed some time.</p><p>"It's nearly complete. With the help of the demon soldiers, the altar's construction is on track. I'll devote myself to refining this treasure; once it's finished, I'll send it to Qingyang Temple immediately," Si Lu understood the importance of this treasure and dared not be negligent.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  This treasure held another significance for him. He wanted to use it to explore the mysteries of the mutual transformation technique and try incorporating the 'Sword Rising from the Heart Sea' technique into the thunder altar to see if it could break the mutual transformation technique.</p><p>If all went well, eliminating the Lu family's expert would be much easier.</p><p>After a brief exchange, Qin Sang bid farewell to Si Lu and returned to the Western Lands.</p><p>…</p><p>Deep sea.</p><p>Inside a certain underwater mountain peak was a cave, where a monster lay.</p><p>This monster was completely white, its body soft as a cloud, sprawled on the ground, its features unseen.</p><p>It emanated no aura, only its occasional body movements revealing it as a living being.</p><p>The cave was quiet.</p><p>In the darkness, the monster suddenly rose from the ground, revealing a large mouth and several bulging eyes from its belly.</p><p>The next moment, the monster stiffened, its body gradually transforming into a human-like silhouette—the man in white.</p><p>"Cough… cough…"</p><p>A violent coughing sound echoed in the cave. The man in white clutched his chest, coughing up blood that evaporated instantly.</p><p>"Amazing!"</p><p>The man in white murmured.</p><p>Just now, preoccupied with escaping, he hadn't had time to identify the technique.  But merely being grazed by that divine light almost severely injured him.</p><p>He had been overconfident, underestimating this demon.</p><p>The man in white silently sighed, wondering where Si Lu had found such an aide. He couldn't be viewed as an ordinary expert.</p><p>This investigation had been abruptly cut short.  He only briefly surveyed the Western Lands before being forced to retreat, still unclear about their plans and the number of their allies.</p><p>However, knowing Si Lu had such a powerful ally was enough to report back.</p><p>Calming his breath, the man in white carefully sensed outside the cave, confirming there were no abnormalities.  He left the cave and cautiously sped away, only returning to Sheng Mu Plain after confirming there were no pursuers.</p><p>Sacred Lake of the Chang You tribe.</p><p>Min Zhuo was not in the sacred temple, but seated on a mountaintop by the sacred lake, seemingly waiting for someone.</p><p>Suddenly, sensing something, he opened his eyes and looked north.  A flash of light appeared, and the man in white materialized.</p><p>Seeing him, Min Zhuo's pupils constricted.  "Sir Envoy, are you injured?"</p><p>"It's nothing!"</p><p>The man in white waved his hand, "They truly do have experts. Your previous loss was not unjust.  But Chief Min, rest assured, we will keep our promise, help you reclaim your territory, and get justice!"</p>
