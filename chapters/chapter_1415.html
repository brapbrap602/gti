<h1>Chapter 1407: Pure Ocean Sect</h1><p>The process of decline was also very slow.</p><p>Scorching aura surged forth, turning the sky a fiery red. If there were islands nearby, the living beings on those islands would surely have been reduced to cinder.</p><p>Even at night, this sea area was illuminated as bright as day by the pillar of light.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had not left their posts for days, occasionally approaching the Buddhist Lotus to assess the strength of the fluctuations.</p><p>As night fell.</p><p>The brightness of the pillar of light had dimmed significantly compared to its peak.</p><p>The scale of the sea pit had also shrunk.</p><p>A stream of light flew out from the center of the sea pit.</p><p>Valley Master Mu went down to probe once more, flying back into the air. He said cautiously, "Now, the intensity is within our tolerance. In another two or three hours, we should be able to enter."</p><p>Merely being able to withstand the impact of this Scarlet Flame aura was not enough.</p><p>They had to wait for the anomaly to weaken further before they had enough leeway to deal with other dangers.</p><p>They had already waited this long; a few more hours wouldn't make a difference.</p><p>Cultivator Qi seemed relieved and said, "Finally, we can enter! I didn't expect this to happen, forcing us to wait outside these past few days, attracting so many people..."</p><p>As he spoke, Cultivator Qi glanced into the distance.</p><p>The sea surged like a tide, gathering a large group of cultivators.</p><p>Figures stood on boats or hovered in mid-air, including Golden Core cultivators, Foundation Establishment cultivators, and even some reckless Qi Refining cultivators who came to join the commotion.</p><p>They were all attracted by the anomaly in the Emptysoul Sea.</p><p>Several of them were descendants of Qi and Wang.</p><p>After asking, they learned that the anomaly here was clearly visible even from thousands of miles away. It was unknown how many more cultivators were rushing over.</p><p>This result caught them off guard, but they couldn't stop it.</p><p>"No matter who comes, we will still have the advantage. As long as we move fast enough, one or two individuals won't pose much of a problem. It's just a pity that the treasures inside might be divided," Valley Master Mu said calmly.</p><p>Then, remembering something, he looked around, surveying the sea surface, "Has True Person Holding Precepts not shown himself yet?"</p><p>Cultivator Qi shook his head and snorted, "No! Nine Precept Island is not far from the Emptysoul Sea. As long as that guy hasn't left Nine Precept Island, he must know about this and can't possibly not come! This person is always cunning; who knows where he is lurking, preparing some conspiracy. Everyone, be careful after entering."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's curiosity.</p><p>Valley Master Mu explained, "Cultivator Qi's Daoist sanctum is not far from Nine Precept Island. Because of conflicts between disciples, there were some disagreements, and later a feud arose due to an accident... It has only been two days since the anomaly appeared. It would be difficult for other Nascent Soul cultivators to arrive so quickly after receiving the news. Holding Precepts' strength is similar to Cultivator Qi's. Alone, facing the four of us, he shouldn't pose too great a threat. Of course, it's always better to be cautious."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>The Boundless Sea was vast and sparsely populated, a mixed bag, and the situation was chaotic. Nascent Soul Daoist sanctums were far apart.</p><p>If they moved fast enough, they would have the opportunity to plunder the Pure Ocean Sect before other Nascent Soul cultivators arrived. But he didn't know how many dangers still existed within the Pure Ocean Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang felt pessimistic and silently watched the Buddhist Lotus, his eyes flickering.</p><p>As time passed.</p><p>The accumulated Scarlet Flame aura inside continued to vent, and its momentum gradually weakened. However, after being impacted by such a massive Scarlet Flame aura, the Buddhist Lotus formed by the array had long been dilapidated.</p><p>It was almost impossible to make out the shape of the Buddhist Lotus. Only fragments of Buddhist light remained.</p><p>But the conflict between these two forces was still very intense.</p><p>Two hours passed quickly.</p><p>After continuous probing, Valley Master Mu and Qin Sang decided to force their way into the Pure Ocean Sect now!</p><p>The broken Buddhist Lotus could not form an obstacle.</p><p>The four appeared near the Buddhist Lotus. They could vaguely see a chaos in the center of the Scarlet Flame aura, seemingly a gate-shaped entrance, distorted by the impact.</p><p>Qin Sang could see more clearly.</p><p>Behind the gate, there was still a rich and fierce Scarlet Flame aura. Deep within the Scarlet Flame aura, there were faint flashes of golden light, but they couldn't make out what it was.</p><p>"Let's move!"</p><p>Valley Master Mu gave the order.</p><p>He held the Serpent Spear in his hand, not pointing it at the entrance, but holding it horizontally in front of his chest.</p><p>'Hiss, hiss...'</p><p>A sound of a python hissing came out. The Serpent Spear's body twisted and suddenly burst out with profound light, transforming into a black python hundreds of feet long.</p><p>The black python's body was illusory, coiling in the air. Its head even stretched out of the sea pit, overlooking the people on the sea surface.</p><p>When the crowd saw Qin Sang and the others enter the sea pit, they wanted to approach and try their luck to pick up some scraps. However, when the black python's cold gaze swept over them, they felt a chill down their spines and their bodies stiffened.</p><p>The black python flew back with a 'whoosh,' and its figure rapidly shrunk, eventually coiling around Valley Master Mu's body, like a serpent armor. The Serpent Spear was actually a defensive and offensive treasure.</p><p>Qi and Wang stood together.</p><p>Female Cultivator Wang took out a tortoise shell-shaped treasure. She clasped her hands together, and the tortoise shell disappeared. A tortoise shell illusion appeared above their heads.</p><p>The tortoise shell hung upside down, sprinkling tassel-like radiance around them, also an extraordinary protective treasure.</p><p>Cultivator Qi took out a spiritual sword to be on guard.</p><p>On the surface, Qin Sang still had the Gold Submergence Sword, but the Eighteen Demon Banners were hidden in his sleeve.</p><p>Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu were in the front.</p><p>Qi and Wang were in the back.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Sword energy and spear shadows appeared together, randomly selecting a gap in the Buddhist Lotus.</p><p>Amidst the loud sound, the pillar of light was blasted open, and then quickly closed.</p><p>Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu exchanged glances and continued to urge their magical treasures, launching attacks at the pillar of light one after another. The opening grew larger and larger, enough for people to enter, so they flashed and rushed in.</p><p>Their judgment was accurate, and everything went very smoothly.</p><p>The Buddhist Lotus array was powerless to stop the intruders.</p><p>The four of them successfully rushed to the center of the pillar of light and clearly saw the gate inside.</p><p>This was an entrance that could accommodate more than a dozen people walking side by side. When intact, it should have been shaped like a memorial archway . However, it was now severely damaged. There were originally words on the top, but now only one stroke remained.</p><p>As expected, it should be one stroke of the word 'Pure' .</p><p>Pure Ocean Sect!</p><p>They found the right place!</p><p>A hint of joy flashed in Valley Master Mu's eyes. After observing for a moment, he rushed in without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qi and Wang followed closely.</p><p>As the figures of the four disappeared.</p><p>The pillar of light returned to its original appearance.</p><p>The cultivators outside waited for a long time before they dared to carefully approach the sea pit.</p><p>"Did the four seniors really go in?"</p><p>Someone asked, looking incredulous.</p><p>The fluctuations emitted by the anomaly were too terrifying. Golden Core cultivators could only barely stand on the edge of the sea pit, and those with lower cultivation levels dared not approach it at all.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivator next to him nodded repeatedly, envyingly saying, "With such a strong restriction, there must be a treasure hidden inside. This is a great opportunity, but it's a pity that we have no chance!"</p><p>"Do you still want to compete with Nascent Soul cultivators for treasure?" his companion rolled his eyes. "I'll be satisfied if I can go in and get a sip of soup after the anomaly disappears."</p><p>...</p><p>No one noticed that two ethereal figures quietly arrived near the Buddhist Lotus.</p>
