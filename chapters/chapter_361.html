<h1>Chapter 354: Legend</h1><p>â€œFellow Daoist Qin, becoming a disciple of Mount Shaohua and achieving such high cultivation, I'm relieved that my earlier negligence didn't hinder your future..."</p><p>Patriarch Han looked ashamed. As if remembering something, he asked, "After my injuries healed, worried about you, I sent people to the Ghost Mountains, but they couldn't find you. I haven't heard from you in all these years. Have you been in secluded cultivation at Mount Shaohua?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "After joining Mount Shaohua and breaking through to Foundation Establishment, I went to the Ancient Battlefield to train. I'm returning from there now and passing by Ghost Market. Meeting you again is a pleasant surprise. As far as I know, the Ghost Mountains are a lawless land. You've brought your clan's experts here. Does the Pure Yang Sect intend to expand its influence here?"</p><p>"Not at all,"</p><p>Patriarch Han shook his head. "Since you are a disciple of Mount Shaohua, you should know that the border of Xiaohan Region is currently unstable. The Heavenly Mandate Alliance is restless, and all the major sects are preparing for war.  At this juncture, many demonic cultivators have been crossing the border, trying to take advantage of the chaos.  My sect has ordered us to eliminate the demonic presence as a warning to ensure the stability of our rear. My family and several others have been assigned to the area around the Ghost Mountains..."</p><p>Qin Sang then learned that Patriarch Han, after reaching Foundation Establishment, had also become the direct disciple of a Golden Core elder in the Pure Yang Sect, holding a high position.</p><p>"Is the Heavenly Mandate Alliance really going to launch a full-scale attack? How serious is the situation?" Qin Sang's heart sank, and he quickly asked.</p><p>Once the war started, the Cloudmire would inevitably become a battlefield, and Mount Shaohua would bear the brunt of it!</p><p>Patriarch Han said, "Don't worry, Fellow Daoist Qin. I heard that the atmosphere in the Cloudmire is indeed tense, but there's no sign of a full-scale war yet.  At least not until the true arrival of the spirit tide. Moreover, the number of Nascent Soul experts in the Xiaohan Region is at its highest in thousands of years. The Heavenly Mandate Alliance will have to weigh its options before making a move!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>What Patriarch Han said was true; the Xiaohan Region was indeed very powerful now.</p><p>However, there were also rumors that not every Nascent Soul expert possessed true Nascent Soul-level combat power. The secrets behind this were beyond their knowledge.</p><p>As they spoke, Qin Sang noticed that the flying ship wasn't heading towards the Great Sui Dynasty.  Curious, he asked, "Isn't the Han estate near the Great Sui?"</p><p>Qin Sang only knew that there was a Han family under the Pure Yang Sect; the map didn't mark the exact location of their estate.</p><p>Patriarch Han smiled and said, "It used to be some distance away from the Great Sui, but now it's within its borders."</p><p>"Oh? Has something changed over the years?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, having a vague guess.</p><p>Patriarch Han hummed in agreement and patiently explained to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Due to my ancestor's great contributions, after he established the Han family, the sect granted us the territory where the Great Sui and several other mortal kingdoms are located.</p><p>"Initially, my ancestor thought mortals were ignorant and sent family members to establish kingdoms and govern them.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, these descendants not only lacked governing skills but, relying on their status as cultivators, acted recklessly and indulged in pleasure, losing their Dao hearts. They plunged the mortal world into chaos and resentment.</p><p>"My ancestor, reflecting on this, decided to let mortals govern themselves!</p><p>"All family members returned to the Han estate to cultivate. Wandering cultivators within the territory were also restrained, forbidden to reveal their powers to mortals or interfere in their affairs.</p><p>"Of course, with the unpredictable methods of cultivators, some things are difficult to eradicate, but after the rules were established, interference did decrease significantly.</p><p>"Since then, the mortal world has been left to develop freely, governed by capable individuals. Although there have been periods of division and unification, and frequent wars, it has prospered unexpectedly.</p><p>"Our Han family only collects tributes from the emperors, bestows a few medicinal pills without disrupting the mortal world's operations, and intervenes during plagues or natural disasters beyond mortal capabilities. It saves us a lot of trouble.</p><p>"Seeing its effectiveness, other families followed suit. Nowadays, this is the norm in the mortal realms controlled by our sect..."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a chill. Fortunately, he had been discreet back then, acting only as a spy, and hadn't recklessly used Yama on the battlefield, especially during the attack on the imperial capital, where he remained completely hidden.</p><p>Otherwise, he might have been caught and executed by the Han family.</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's thoughts, Patriarch Han continued, "My ancestor's decision was indeed wise. Over the years, outstanding individuals have emerged in the mortal world, some whose talents even we cultivators admire.</p><p>"However, few can compare to the Empress of the Great Sui!</p><p>"General Qin, having served under her, you must know her well?</p><p>"During her lifetime, the Empress, as a woman, made astonishing moves, launching a military coup.</p><p>"Her father had just ascended the throne for a few days when she seized power, honoring him as the Retired Emperor. Back then, the Han family also debated this unconventional act, but later decided not to interfere and recognized her position.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, after ascending the throne, the Empress displayed extraordinary talent. Internally, she selected capable officials and developed national strength. Externally, she formed alliances and, when the time was ripe, launched a war with lightning speed.</p><p>"With the strength of the Great Sui alone, she won consecutive battles, conquering several countries in just one year.</p><p>"Now, the Great Sui's territory is comparable to the Heng Kingdom, and under her rule, it is increasingly prosperous.</p><p>"The Empress, a woman equal to any man, achieved both literary and martial accomplishments, a true monarch of her time!</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin... Fellow Daoist Qin..."</p><p>Patriarch Han praised the Empress profusely, only to find Qin Sang somewhat distracted. "Fellow Daoist Qin, what are you thinking about?"</p><p>"Ah? Nothing! Nothing!"</p><p>Qin Sang snapped back to his senses, shaking his head quickly to cover up. Then, he coughed lightly and couldn't help but ask, "The Empress was indeed remarkable! But you mentioned her lifetime. Has she passed away?"</p><p>Patriarch Han nodded.</p><p>"The Empress was, after all, a mortal. Moreover, with the Great Sui's national strength, expanding its territory and creating such a legacy, every step was like walking on thin ice, with the risk of utter ruin...</p><p>"The Empress was like dancing on a tightrope, working day and night, exhausted both physically and mentally. Though the Han family provided some restorative pills, it was too late.</p><p>"However, she lived a magnificent life, one that even we cultivators marvel at, a life truly lived to the fullest.</p><p>"Compared to her, many cultivators are merely pieces of decaying wood, living a few extra years!"</p><p>Listening to Patriarch Han's words, Qin Sang's mind wandered.</p><p>The Princess of Dongyang, the Imperial Princess, the Empress...</p><p>It could be said that Qin Sang had witnessed her rise every step of the way.</p><p>He had long known her ambition, and on the night before his departure, he knew she was prepared to risk everything, acting as bait to lure the Crown Prince out, helping her one last time.</p><p>He hadn't expected her conviction to remain so strong.</p><p>She had become a legend.</p>
