Chapter 1876: The Grand Profound Observatory


The White Tiger Star煞 unfurled its massive form, its two enormous forepaws nearly touching the Yin-Yang Diagram.  Even before the collision, astonishing phenomena manifested across the battlefield.

‘Boom!’

As if a colossal fist had smashed into the lake, the water level instantly plummeted. The lake surface caved inward, while a terrifying force radiated outward from the center, causing the surrounding water to surge upward in a thousand-foot tidal wave.

Within the battlefield, the starry sky vanished, replaced by the clearly visible form of a dreamlike White Tiger Sacred Beast, its body shimmering like starlight, and an ever-spinning, rapidly expanding Yin-Yang pattern.

‘Roar!’

The tiger's roar shook heaven and earth.  Its two forepaws pierced the Yin-Yang Diagram, landing, perhaps coincidentally, precisely at the boundary between Yin and Yang.

If anyone else were present, even if their eyes could perceive the White Tiger's form, their spiritual sense would register it as a sword – a ferocious, ominous sword!

The Yin-Yang Diagram hung in the void, appearing so thin and fragile, seemingly unable to withstand the blow.

Even at this moment, witnessing the White Tiger about to tear apart the Yin-Yang Diagram,  Zhijian Zhenren’s voice remained calm and steady as he gave his assessment of the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation.  He showed no intention of dodging, instead raising his right hand and drawing a circle in the air before him.

True Essence flowed into his fingers, tracing a perfect circle in the void.  He spoke softly, "Yin-Yang Dharma Sword!"

‘Whoosh!’

The black and white energies within the Yin-Yang Diagram suddenly rippled. Before the White Tiger could shred it, the diagram retreated on its own.  With the Yin-Yang Diagram's dispersal, the White Tiger Star煞 faced no further resistance.

At that moment, the black and white energies that had separated from the Yin-Yang Diagram surged into the circle drawn by Zhijian Zhenren's fingertip.  In an instant, a Dharma Sword materialized within.

The sword's blade was half black and half white, the division pure and distinct, as if forged from two separate pieces.  Its shape was identical to the Vanquishing Heart Sword, which had vanished without a trace.

‘Hum!’

Provoked by the White Tiger Star煞, the Yin-Yang Dharma Sword erupted with a sharp sword intent.

Qin Sang stared at the Yin-Yang Dharma Sword, astonishment filling his heart.  The sword was still the same, no longer than three feet, yet it now felt like a colossal, towering divine sword, reaching thousands, tens of thousands of feet high!  If the White Tiger Star煞 borrowed the might of the constellations, this sword commanded the authority of Heaven itself!

‘Swish!’

The Yin-Yang Dharma Sword vanished, replaced by a flash of black and white sword light that slashed outward.

In an instant, the black and white sword light met the White Tiger Star煞.  They were the only things left between heaven and earth, as if time itself had frozen.

‘Boom!’

The two supreme sword intents collided without any flourish, instantly engulfing the battlefield in blinding sword light. Within the light, glimpses of starlight and black and white energies could be seen, but neither the White Tiger Sacred Beast nor the Yin-Yang Dharma Sword were visible, nor could the Cloud Wanderer Sword or the Vanquishing Heart Sword be found.

Incredibly sharp sword energies erupted, each possessing terrifying destructive power.

‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’

‘Crash…’

The surrounding thousand-foot tidal waves, before they could fall, were shattered by the chaotic sword energies. Water droplets scattered through the air.  The sun, previously obscured by the starry sky, shone down, its rays refracting through the water droplets to create a rainbow bridge across the battlefield. The sparkling droplets lent a strange beauty to the deadly scene.

Standing beneath the rainbow bridge, Qin Sang's gaze sharpened, his thoughts racing, and his sword incantations shifting.

‘Clang!’

The sound of swords clashing rang out from within the sword light, followed by a figure retreating – Zhijian Zhenren.  He had stood firm during the collision of the Yin-Yang Dharma Sword and the White Tiger Star煞, but now he was steadily retreating.

‘Clang!’

Another clang of swords echoed just in front of Zhijian Zhenren as two sword shadows crossed paths.  The Yin-Yang Dharma Sword and the White Tiger Star煞 annihilated each other, and the Vanquishing Heart Sword reappeared, hovering before Zhijian Zhenren, blocking the suddenly appearing Cloud Wanderer Sword.

Qin Sang's figure emerged close behind the Cloud Wanderer Sword, though this Qin Sang appeared ethereal and unreal, for it was not his true body but a Sword Spirit.

The Sword Spirit's attack failed, its form popping like a bubble and vanishing into nothingness, along with the Cloud Wanderer Sword.

Zhijian Zhenren’s expression remained grave, his retreat continuing as the Vanquishing Heart Sword flickered, appearing to his left.  Then another Sword Spirit, wielding a sword, attacked, appearing without warning as if born from the void or shot from nothingness, making it impossible to defend against.

‘Clang!’

This strange and unpredictable attack was still repelled by the Vanquishing Heart Sword.

‘Clang! Clang! Clang…’

The sounds of clashing swords merged into one, ringing out seven times in rapid succession.  A torrential downpour would be an inadequate description of Qin Sang’s sword momentum.

Having comprehended Sword From the Heart through the Chengying Sword inheritance, bordering on the Dao, Qin Sang had been striving to integrate it, such as incorporating his swordsmanship into the Seven Souls Sword Formation, evolving more variations.  He had made progress, and these seven sword strikes were nothing short of uncanny.

For other mid-Nascent Soul cultivators, defending against these seven strikes would already be a formidable task, let alone after enduring the impact of the White Tiger Star煞.

Yet, even as Zhijian Zhenren continued to retreat, appearing somewhat hurried in his defense, the Vanquishing Heart Sword flickered continuously, blocking all seven strikes!

However, these seven consecutive strikes were not Qin Sang’s limit!

"Fellow Daoist, be careful!" Qin Sang shouted.

In the next moment, seven Sword Spirits appeared simultaneously above Zhijian Zhenren’s head, each wielding a divine sword.

They struck down in unison, their killing intent filling the heavens!

Zhijian Zhenren's performance had instilled absolute confidence in Qin Sang, prompting him to hold nothing back.  Only by doing so could he effectively utilize Zhijian Zhenren to refine his own sword Dao.

"Such potent killing intent!" Zhijian Zhenren's gaze was serious.  He sensed the danger before the sword momentum fully formed, accelerating his retreat until he nearly reached the edge of the battlefield.

As he retreated, his fingers moved like a wheel, forming hand seals in rapid succession, before finally letting out a low shout.

"Well met!"

He suddenly struck out with his palm, hitting the hilt of the Vanquishing Heart Sword.

The Vanquishing Heart Sword trembled violently, radiating brilliant light.  Its blade became transparent like crystal, or perhaps, it had transformed into pure sword light.

Suddenly, a beam of light shot skyward. This light wasn't as sharp and aggressive as typical sword light, appearing almost gentle, yet it was breathtakingly stunning.

In comparison, the Cloud Wanderer Sword possessed greater imposing power, but it lacked a sense of profoundness.

Qin Sang's eyes widened, captivated by the beam of light, unwavering in his gaze.  In this moment, he seemed mesmerized, even forgetting his own sword as he stared fixedly at the radiant light.

At this moment, victory or defeat no longer mattered.
…

"Sword formations… It seems Fellow Daoist has made your choice."

Zhijian Zhenren’s voice sounded beside him.

At some point, Zhijian Zhenren had appeared next to Qin Sang. Sword energies still howled across the battlefield, stirring the wind and clouds, but both of them had withdrawn their sword momentum, and the chaos was gradually subsiding.

Qin Sang nodded.

He knew he couldn't hide his choice from Zhijian Zhenren. He had chosen the path of Sword Formations, though he had also integrated the Killing Sword Dao he gleaned from the Chengying Sword inheritance.  However, it wasn't as pure as a true Killing Sword cultivator.

This choice was the result of careful deliberation.

He cultivated a Killing Dao cultivation method, which logically should make cultivating Killing Sword easier. However, as his cultivation advanced, Qin Sang became certain that the Killing Dao of the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* and the sword Dao of the Chengying Sword inheritance were fundamentally different, not the Killing Sword Dao commonly understood.

He wasn't sure if further cultivating Killing Sword would conflict with his cultivation method, but he knew it would undoubtedly require significant mental energy and effort to comprehend, and he couldn't obtain a second Chengying Sword.

Sword Formations, on the other hand, were readily available. With his existing foundation, as his cultivation progressed and his understanding of the Seven Souls Killing Formation deepened, it would complement his cultivation method.  Even if he delved deeper into Sword Formations in the future and learned other formations, he would have a clear path to follow, making it far easier than independent comprehension.

Inspired by Zhijian Zhenren, he sought to achieve something in the sword Dao, but he was also clear about his own desires, leading him to choose the most suitable path for himself.

"I recall Fellow Daoist mentioning that Sword Formations are also a part of the Sword Dao…"  Qin Sang said.

As he spoke, he continued to observe the battlefield, watching the mist dissipate and the waves recede.  In his eyes, the image of the two swords clashing lingered.

He wasn't concerned about the outcome, and even his own sword gradually faded from his mind, leaving only the image of Zhijian Zhenren's sword light.

Qin Sang slowly closed his eyes, the image of that sword light deeply imprinted in his mind, lingering and forming an almost indelible mark.

"Indeed! Fellow Daoist's clear understanding of your path is the nascent form of a Sword Heart. As I said before, for those who possess a Sword Heart, all paths are the Sword Dao!"  Zhijian Zhenren, noticing Qin Sang’s state, stood with his hands clasped behind his back, falling silent after his words.

After an unknown period, Qin Sang opened his eyes, exhaling deeply, and bowed respectfully to Zhijian Zhenren.

Observing Qin Sang’s expression, Zhijian Zhenren said, "Fellow Daoist’s final sword strike was truly exceptional, yet it felt incomplete.  When Fellow Daoist reaches the peak of your cultivation, let us cross swords again!"

Qin Sang nodded. "This formation is vast and profound.  At times, I believe I have grasped it, yet with every advancement in cultivation, new insights emerge."

The Seven Souls Killing Formation indeed had flaws, not inherent to the formation itself but due to Qin Sang’s insufficient cultivation.  He concealed the flaws as best he could, and during the rapidly changing battle, they were almost negligible.  However, Zhijian Zhenren had discerned them with just a few sword strikes.

Qin Sang was no longer surprised. This exchange had given him a profound understanding of Zhijian Zhenren’s mastery of the sword Dao.

Zhijian Zhenren’s two reminders, and that final sword strike, all contained elements of guidance.

Qin Sang felt no disappointment. The Sword Dao wasn't his entire being, and being inferior to Zhijian Zhenren in swordsmanship was within his expectations.

Of course, he hadn’t anticipated such a significant gap, even doubting whether he could defeat Zhijian Zhenren at full strength.


"My matters here are concluded. It's time to return,"  Zhijian Zhenren said, retrieving the Vanquishing Heart Sword and rising into the air.

Qin Sang summoned his escaping light and followed.

During the return journey, Qin Sang was quiet, replaying that sword strike over and over in his mind.

Back on Sword Heart Island, as Qin Sang was about to enter seclusion to digest the gains from this battle, his sword servant delivered a talisman message.

The message was from Master Gu, informing him that Zhenren Xun was at the White Stone Altar and requesting his immediate return.

This matter was equally important and couldn’t be delayed. Qin Sang bid farewell to Zhijian Zhenren and departed Sword Heart Island.

Traveling westward, Qin Sang gathered some news along the way.

Overall, the situation remained much the same as five years prior.  The Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom had amassed troops at the Yellow Springs Path, with constant skirmishes and casualties on both sides.  However, there were no signs of all-out war, clearly indicating that both sides were still preparing.

Nevertheless, the tension grew daily, and all signs pointed to the inevitability of war, a matter of when, not if.

Upon seeing Qin Sang, Master Gu wasted no time and immediately led him to the altar to visit Zhenren Xun, offering reminders and points to note along the way.

"Junior Gu Han and Qingfeng, we pay our respects to Zhenren Xun."

Inside a golden hall, Qin Sang and Master Gu bowed to a Daoist priest.

Zhenren Xun wore simple blue Daoist robes and cloud slippers.  His gentle demeanor marked him as a venerable elder.

Facing Zhenren Xun directly, Qin Sang felt as though he stood before an ordinary mortal, his aura so subtle as to be imperceptible, making it impossible to discern his cultivation level.

However, Zhenren Xun's official rank of Third Grade spoke volumes.

Despite his high rank, Zhenren Xun preferred the title of "Zhenren," which both Qin Sang and Master Gu used to address him.

"No need for formalities!"  Zhenren Xun raised his hands slightly, without any air of superiority, and looked at Qin Sang with a smile. "Master Gu tells me Zhenren Qingfeng possesses a treasure that can aid our Dao Sect in slaying demons and eliminating evil?"

Qin Sang nodded, immediately retrieving the war drum and presenting it with both hands. "Please, Zhenren Xun, have a look."

Zhenren Xun accepted the drum, not immediately examining it, but sending a talisman command outside the hall. He then held it up for closer inspection.

"Indeed, a treasure.  Unfortunately…"  Zhenren Xun's face held a hint of regret.

All three understood the source of his regret. Master Gu spoke up at the opportune moment, "Fellow Daoist Qingfeng has a plan for its restoration.  With the assistance of a Dao Sect grandmaster in the future, it may not be impossible to restore this treasure to its former glory."

As they spoke, a streak of blue light landed outside the hall, revealing a white-haired old Daoist priest.

The old Daoist seemed to hold a high position. Upon entering, he merely gave a casual bow to Zhenren Xun, who didn't mind and handed him the war drum.

The old Daoist examined it for a long time, his eyes gleaming.  He suddenly looked at Qin Sang, scrutinizing him. "You intend to restore this treasure yourself?"

"This junior knows his own limitations and hopes for the Real Man’s guidance," Qin Sang bowed deeply and said respectfully.

The old Daoist exchanged a glance with Zhenren Xun, his face thoughtful. After a moment, he asked, "What kind of refining techniques do you wish to learn? Our Dao Sect has orthodox refining techniques, some that use refining to cultivate the Dao, and others that are more unorthodox, such as refining limbs and organs with treasures, replacing the fragile flesh with sturdy external objects, or completely merging one's spirit with an artifact, becoming a being akin to a tool spirit or puppet…"

The old Daoist spoke at length, his words sometimes surprising, sometimes causing Qin Sang to frown.  Master Qi had once questioned whether there was a Grand Dao within the art of refining.  The old Daoist had now presented not just one, but several.

"However," after speaking extensively, the old Daoist suddenly changed his tone, adding, "Many of these inheritances are incomplete, and some only exist as one or two ancient texts, possibly not even originating from our Dao Sect, their origins unknown. I can offer little guidance on these; you would need to explore them on your own."

Qin Sang glanced at Master Gu, and without much hesitation, replied,  "This junior wishes to learn orthodox refining techniques."

"Good, follow me!"  The old Daoist tossed the war drum back to Qin Sang and walked out of the hall.  Qin Sang bowed to Zhenren Xun and Master Gu, hurrying after the old Daoist.

A streak of blue light enveloped the old Daoist and Qin Sang, landing before another golden hall.

Even with the doors closed, Qin Sang could sense pure refining fire within.

Inside the hall, after assessing Qin Sang's refining skills, the old Daoist produced a few jade slips.  "These contain the inheritance of the ancient Grand Profound Observatory. They should be most suitable for you." (End of Chapter)
