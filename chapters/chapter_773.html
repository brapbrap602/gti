<h1>Chapter 765: The Spirit Talisman</h1><p>For a time, the roles reversed.</p><p>In the thick purple mist, two figures chased each other at high speed.</p><p>Within the purple mist, losing sight of the young man even for a moment meant the possibility of losing him completely. Qin Sang, regardless of his spiritual energy consumption, relentlessly activated the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, doggedly pursuing him.</p><p>His spiritual energy depletion was rapid, but the young man’s was even faster.</p><p>The young man, his body invaded by the fierce poison, began to feel the trouble mounting.  The poison brought not only intense pain but also caused his spiritual energy to stagnate, clinging to him like a malignant tumor, spreading inward and proving extremely difficult to eliminate.</p><p>Failing to subdue Qin Sang in one fell swoop had left him in an extremely passive situation.</p><p>Pressed relentlessly by Qin Sang, he fought a retreating battle.</p><p>A considerable distance still separated them from the exit of the Purple Mist Wilderness.</p><p>Qin Sang and his two-headed…  attacked fiercely, giving the young man no chance to breathe. The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and the Ebony Sword appeared alternately, soon leaving a wound on the young man’s body.</p><p>Quickly, more wounds followed.</p><p>The young man, bleeding profusely, began to lose his composure; the poison mist was terrifyingly potent.</p><p>The moment his jade bracelet was destroyed, he realized that if he couldn't kill Qin Sang, being worn down would inevitably lead to his defeat.</p><p>And so it proved!</p><p>Qin Sang was an anomaly among Foundation Establishment cultivators. His escape techniques were unmatched, surpassing even those he'd witnessed from Nascent Soul cultivators.  The young man had no hope of escaping Qin Sang’s relentless pursuit.</p><p>Sadly, his attempt to unexpectedly self-detonate his treasure failed.</p><p>…</p><p>A short, sharp cry abruptly ceased.</p><p>The turmoil subsided slightly. Qin Sang slowly emerged from the purple mist, coldly gazing at the corpse on the ground.</p><p>Remembering the earlier battle at Duoyan Island, Qin Sang dared not show any mercy to any enemy.  Without an opportunity to capture him alive, he could only decisively kill the young man.</p><p>The young man's final attempt to self-detonate his Golden Core was thwarted when the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire incinerated his primordial spirit.  Unfortunately, his Golden Core had already shattered, rendering it useless.</p><p>Qin Sang approached the young man's body, collected his belongings, and with a wave of his hand, summoned flames to incinerate the corpse, leaving no trace.</p><p>The greatest prize was undoubtedly the golden ring treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang probed the treasure with his spiritual sense, erasing the young man's mark.</p><p>As expected, the golden ring possessed a binding ability. It was called the Golden Yao Lock, a treasure forged from a rare metal. It could expand and contract, and held a peculiar binding power.</p><p>This ring could not only affect treasures; unexpectedly, it could directly restrain opponents.</p><p>Only treasures like the Ten Directions Yama Banner, relying on the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, were not only unaffected but could actually suppress the Golden Yao Lock. Ordinary treasures would be wary and hesitant when facing it.</p><p>“Cough… cough…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure swayed, and he quickly sat cross-legged on the ground.</p><p>The shockwave from the self-destruction of the grey sword had inflicted considerable injuries upon him, injuries he’d been suppressing until now.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings and discovered he was near the canyon.</p><p>Fortunately, he hadn't encountered any ferocious beasts or other cultivators during the pursuit.  Qin Sang ordered the two-headed… to relax and recover without hesitation.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang's breathing steadied. He finished his cultivation, stood up, looked at the Golden Yao Lock, and stored it in his dantian to nurture and subdue it as quickly as possible.</p><p>A mid-grade treasure would provide significant assistance.</p><p>If his Golden Light Armor was intact, this battle wouldn't have been so arduous.</p><p>Then Qin Sang opened the young man's pouch.  The pills, talismans, and other items had already been depleted by the young man before his death.</p><p>Qin Sang was most curious about the young man's identity, but a thorough search revealed nothing to indicate his sect affiliation. There were several jade slips, but they contained cultivation methods and spells of unknown origin.</p><p>“He didn't deny it, so it's likely the Western Nether League, but I'm not sure which trading house. However, if he dared to oppose the leader of the Eastern Extreme League, perhaps, like Xiang Yi, he was a close confidant of the leader. I just wonder what his purpose was in following me…”</p><p>Qin Sang flipped his palm, revealing a spirit talisman.</p><p>This talisman was unusual.  It was inscribed with intricate patterns Qin Sang couldn't decipher. When he attempted to infuse it with spiritual energy, the talisman remained unresponsive.</p><p>It didn't seem to be due to insufficient spiritual energy, but rather the need for specific conditions to activate it.</p><p>“What is this thing? This is the only thing I don't understand. Does it have something to do with the ancient divine platform?”</p><p>Curious, Qin Sang examined the talisman but couldn't find any clues, so he put it away to investigate later.</p><p>“This journey has certainly been full of unexpected events,” Qin Sang sighed, then recalled a scene from the previous fight and quickly summoned the Ten Directions Yama Banner once more.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire gushed forth, but this time, there was no reaction.</p><p>"Probably because I wasn't close enough," Qin Sang mused, "that means the purple mist and the mysterious spirit fire are unrelated."</p><p>He didn't put away the Ten Directions Yama Banner, but took his magical artifacts and returned the way he came.  He wanted to test the talismans' effect on the ancient altar, but when he returned to where it had been, he was stunned. The ancient altar had vanished!</p><p>The ground was seamless, perfectly joined. Only the traces of his fight with the young man remained; there was no sign that the ancient altar had ever existed.</p><p>"The ancient altar clearly rose from the ground," Qin Sang analyzed. " Xiang Yi must have done something to the three stone halls, awakening the altar. I couldn't even open the ancient prohibitions outside the halls, let alone awaken the altar myself."</p><p>Qin Sang went to the spot where the ancient altar had disappeared and made a final attempt. He took out the talisman and tried again and again, but to no avail. He knew he'd missed his chance.</p><p>"So, the young man's eagerness to self-destruct his artifact wasn't just to kill me; it might also have been related to the ancient altar. With the altar closed, his mission failed."</p><p>Qin Sang knew too little and could only guess.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang gave up, tossing the talisman into his Qianjun Ring and deciding to forget the matter. He didn't want to get involved in the hidden struggle between the two Grand Masters. If there was immediate gain, it would be worth the risk, but now that even the ancient altar was inaccessible, it wasn't worth considering further.</p><p>It was a pity; Qin Sang had high hopes for the altar. He decided to eliminate the young man at all costs.  Such a strange ancient altar, once it yielded a treasure, it would surely be an invaluable one.</p><p>The spoils from using the Blood-Soiled Divine Light seemed to only yield the Jin Yao Lock of any note. Whether it was a gain or a loss was hard to say.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, dismissing his thoughts, and summoned the Nine Netherworld Magic Fire again.</p><p>The sensation reappeared, clearly pointing towards the depths of the purple mist.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, mentally calculating the time.  There was still plenty, so he decided to go right then. He mounted his two-headed demonic beast, giving it instructions, while he focused on subduing the Jin Yao Lock and mastering this artifact as quickly as possible.</p><p>Soon, they arrived before the third stone hall.  Qin Sang tried, but realized he couldn't open the ancient prohibition alone, and continued onward.</p><p>They walked a distance, the terrain remaining relatively flat.</p><p>Suddenly, the two-headed demonic beast let out a low growl, warning Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang leaped to the ground and took a few steps forward, stopping at the edge of a canyon.</p>
