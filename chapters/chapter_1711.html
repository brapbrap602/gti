<h1>Chapter 1702: Heavenly Devil</h1><p>Shrouded in a hazy mist,</p><p>Huashen stood before the temple gate, his gaze sweeping past Grandmaster Xingji and the other eminent monks.</p><p>Apricot-yellow temple walls, grey roof ridges, ink-black mountains—the ancient temple, a silhouette flickering within the floating clouds, was serene and solemn.</p><p>Monks filed out, lining the path.</p><p>Both inside and outside the temple, many were not of the Buddhist faith.</p><p>All eyes were on Huashen, appraising this Xie Clan ancestor, wondering what kind of divine being he truly was. Of course, some harbored ulterior motives, their eyes fixed on the Five Elements Elixir.</p><p>While Huashen and Grandmaster Xingji conversed, some grew impatient and sent voice transmissions.</p><p>Their dialogue astonished the crowd, then brought sudden understanding. No wonder Holy Venerable Huiguang had personally cleared his name—he had become a Buddhist lapdog.</p><p>This was precisely Qin Sang's intention.</p><p>He held no sectarian biases, viewing Daoism and Buddhism equally.</p><p>By openly declaring his affiliation with Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, binding Huashen to the Buddhist sect and establishing a righteous stance, he ensured a degree of safety, at least within the monastery.</p><p>After the transaction, Huashen wouldn't leave immediately, intending to stay and attempt a breakthrough.</p><p>Thereafter, if all went well, Huashen would utilize the monastery's resources to gather items needed by his true body, allowing Qin Sang to focus solely on cultivation in Luye.</p><p>Before coming, Qin Sang meticulously filtered Huashen's memories and placed restrictions on him.</p><p>If anything went awry, he would decisively abandon Huashen!</p><p>Huashen and Grandmaster Xingji chatted amicably, appearing to those with malicious intent as colluding villains.</p><p>After the pleasantries,</p><p>they entered the temple together.</p><p>Sweet Dew Zen Monastery had prepared a grand reception, fully honoring Holy Venerable Huiguang's promise. Though Qin Sang disliked such formalities, he played along.</p><p>Like a marionette, Huashen busied himself from dawn till noon, putting on a show for the guests.</p><p>Once the guests departed,</p><p>Grandmaster Xingji personally led Huashen to a cave dwelling for rest.  It was evident that the preparations were somewhat hasty; they hadn't anticipated Huashen's decision to stay.</p><p>The cave dwelling, located on a rear mountain of the monastery, was secluded and elegant, a truly superior cultivation ground.</p><p>Huashen was quite satisfied, thinking it worthy of a holy land.</p><p>Such a dwelling could only be surpassed by the Heavenly Palace on Lingxiao Peak in the North Sea, and this one was certainly not the finest in Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>The only slight imperfection was that he didn't have the mountain to himself. Another eminent monk of the monastery also cultivated there.</p><p>Declining further arrangements, Huashen saw Grandmaster Xingji off and sat in contemplation.  A guest monk then led Xie An, the Zhou-Ruan couple, and others who had been waiting elsewhere.</p><p>“Greetings, Ancestor!”</p><p>“Greetings, Senior!”</p><p>……</p><p>They knelt and kowtowed, their voices and expressions filled with uncontainable excitement.</p><p>They still felt as if in a dream.</p><p>Huashen said indifferently, “Xie Yi and Zhou Li have been accepted as disciples by Shen Chen. As for you, return and continue as you have. The Xie Clan and Loutai Taoist Temple should work together to govern the three prefectures.  This old man will no longer involve himself in worldly affairs. If you encounter any trouble, go cry to Sweet Dew Zen Monastery…”</p><p>Dismissing them, Huashen sat quietly for a while before leaving the cave.</p><p>The guest monk remained respectfully outside.</p><p>“This Daoist wishes to visit Holy Venerable on Small Boundless Mountain. Could the Venerable Monk lead the way?” Huashen asked casually.</p><p>The guest monk nodded without further inquiry, silently leading the way.</p><p>One behind the other, they walked through the mountains, taking in the scenic beauty.</p><p>This was the heart of Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, heavily guarded. Along the way, Huashen sensed powerful auras hidden in the shadows more than once.</p><p>However, these individuals seemed to have received instructions, as none came to question them.</p><p>Their passage was unimpeded.</p><p>Reaching the foot of a green mountain, the guest monk stopped and pressed his palms together.</p><p>Huashen thanked him and proceeded towards the mountain.  Suddenly, a voice called out, “Fellow Daoist Qin, please enter.”</p><p>A stone path materialized within the forest.</p><p>The mountain itself appeared unremarkable, but upon entering, its inner splendor was revealed. Compared to this, his own cave dwelling paled in comparison. Truly a place befitting a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>The stone path wound through the forest, accompanied by birdsong.</p><p>Huashen saw no Buddhist statues or stone carvings. Reaching the end of the path, he arrived at the summit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the summit held no temple, only two meditation cushions placed on a stone, occupied by Holy Venerable Huiguang and Holy King Qinghu. Beside them was an altar.</p><p>They had been meditating with closed eyes and now opened them simultaneously, gazing towards him.</p><p>Observed by Nascent Soul experts, Huashen's expression remained unchanged. He noticed that Holy King Qinghu had grown three more fluffy tails, though they appeared somewhat illusory.</p><p>“Greetings, Holy Monk, Holy King.”</p><p>Huashen offered his respects.</p><p>“Greetings, Fellow Daoist Qin,” Holy Venerable Huiguang inclined his head slightly, gesturing towards a materialized meditation cushion and inviting him to sit.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu smiled faintly, “You have some courage, I'll give you that!”</p><p>Huashen sat down without hesitation, immediately stating his request, “Will the two of you refrain from interfering in the transactions between myself and Fellow Daoist Mo?”</p><p>“We shall not interfere in any way,” Holy Venerable Huiguang promised.</p><p>Huashen nodded, then produced a jade slip and handed it to Holy Venerable Huiguang, “I would trouble the Holy Monk to set up a spirit array according to the instructions within.”</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang glanced at it and with a flick of his finger, sent the jade slip shooting out of the mountain as a streak of light.</p><p>“This array is somewhat complex and will require some time.”</p><p>“It doesn't matter.”</p><p>Huashen inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. At least the first step went smoothly.</p><p>This array was called the Myriad Mile Azure Sky Array, a type of communication array. With Huashen residing in Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, it was inconvenient for his true body to approach. They would use this array to communicate.  The monastery certainly possessed similar secret techniques, but only his own could be trusted.</p><p>This array was something Qin Sang had acquired from the Heavenly Palace.  Due to the complexity of its setup and the high value of the required spirit materials, coupled with its limited communication range and uses, it was rather impractical.</p><p>Only a place like Sweet Dew Zen Monastery could afford such extravagance.</p><p>Next, the three began discussing the karmic oath.</p><p>It was primarily a debate between Huashen and Holy King Qinghu, with Holy Venerable Huiguang occasionally interjecting fairly.</p><p>Qin Sang's objective was self-preservation.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu generally accepted Huashen's demands, but one point was fiercely debated. Any promise made by him was limited to this realm and before Qin Sang reached the Nascent Soul stage, ensuring he wouldn't bully the weak.</p><p>Once the oath was finalized,</p><p>they set up the altar and swore the oath.</p><p>The ritual for the karmic oath was complex, taking three days to complete.</p><p>Three days later,</p><p>Holy King Qinghu's lips curved slightly. “Have you decided what you want?”</p><p>Huashen said gravely, “I would like to examine the Holy King's treasures more closely.”</p><p>“Very well!”</p><p>Holy King Qinghu's smile widened, her features instantly radiating charm.</p><p>With a pat of her jade belt, streams of light shot out like flowing water, hovering in the space between the three, allowing Huashen to choose freely.</p><p>Huashen scanned them briefly, a puzzled expression crossing his face.  There was no spirit gathering array.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu lazily explained, “The Ancient Spirit Gathering Array is located within a hidden realm in the East Sea. Whether I move the array from the hidden realm or reveal its location to you depends on your preference.  Forcibly moving the array carries the risk of damage.  Of course, should the array be damaged, I will offer alternative compensation.”</p><p>Huashen nodded. Although he didn't answer, he had already made his decision.</p><p>He would definitely have Holy King Qinghu move the array. Otherwise, wouldn't it be giving her the opportunity to trap him?</p><p>He looked again at the treasures before him.</p><p>Various immortal trees and wondrous flowers, jade slips and ancient texts, elixirs and magical artifacts—a dazzling display. Their values varied, but each was a rare marvel.</p><p>Huashen inwardly marveled at the wealth of a Nascent Soul cultivator.  With a wave of his hand, the spiritual light shimmered, and an object flew out, landing in his palm.</p><p>It was a jade-green spiritual bamboo, only three feet tall, resembling a long flute. The bamboo stalk was perfectly straight, divided into seven sections, each identical in length and thickness.</p><p>Even the base, where the roots would be, was the same, only slightly paler.</p><p>Strangely, the bamboo stalk had no leaves, only a single, crystalline flower blooming at its tip.</p><p>It was the Seventh Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo!</p><p>Leafless yet bearing a flower—this was the mark of a mature Seventh Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo. The spiritual flower could be used in alchemy, but if the bamboo itself was to be used for refining a magical artifact, the flower would be refined along with it to enhance its power.</p><p>Huashen examined it carefully, primarily checking for any damage.  This was a requirement of the *Postnatal Wooden Figure Stele*.  The spiritual wood used as a medium had to be complete.</p><p>After the inspection, Huashen returned the bamboo and summoned a silver flower as large as a plate, a crescent-shaped green fruit, and a gnarled tree root covered in bumps…</p><p>Holy King Qinghu had preserved them well, as if they had just been picked, vibrant and fresh.</p><p>These spirit herbs and the elixirs in bottles had varying effects. For instance, the green fruit could enhance divine sense, its potency comparable to the Azurefall Ginseng Fruit.</p><p>Huashen held the green fruit in his hand, seemingly reluctant to part with it, before finally returning it.</p><p>He then turned his attention to the jade slips.  They contained the post-Nascent Soul secrets mentioned by Holy King Qinghu, as well as other esoteric techniques.</p><p>*Ancient Hua Scripture*, *Hundredfold Yin Thunder*, *Four Secret Divine Records*…</p><p>Indeed, each was a superior human cultivation method.</p><p>*Hundredfold Yin Thunder*, in particular, was a top-tier secret technique of the Profound Water Dao, only cultivable after reaching the Nascent Soul stage. Refining the Profound Water Yin Thunder and layering it multiple times not only resulted in terrifying power but also invoked the power of heaven and earth, making it difficult for enemies to evade.</p><p>It required the cultivation of a water-based cultivation method, supplemented by pure water-type true essence, otherwise, its mastery would be exceedingly difficult.</p><p>It was perfect for Huashen.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's true body still didn't know if he could advance to the Nascent Soul stage, and Huashen was even further away. No matter how tempting the secret technique, he could only reluctantly give it up.</p><p>Returning the *Hundredfold Yin Thunder*, he picked up another jade slip. Seeing the name inscribed on it, his spirits lifted. It was this technique that had finally convinced him to take the risk.</p><p>*Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture*!</p><p>Five large characters met his gaze, followed by the outline of the secret technique.  The jade slip contained restrictions, allowing him to see only a portion of its contents, yet he grasped the essence of this technique.</p><p>It involved actively drawing in a strand of demonic nature from an Outer Realm Heavenly Devil, inviting the outer devil into the body to illuminate the primordial spirit.</p><p>Finally, he examined the artifacts. While there were no spirit treasures, there were pseudo-spirit treasures.</p><p>After inspecting each one, Huashen hesitated.  He desired the Ancient Spirit Gathering Array, the *Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture*, and the Seventh Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo.  There was also the Seven Star Root, which could be used as a primary ingredient to refine an elixir described in the *Panhu True Scripture*, enhancing the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>However, the compensation offered by Holy King Qinghu, along with the Soul Calming Incense formula, wasn't enough to exchange for everything.  As for the piece of Soul Calming Incense, he would keep it for Liuli.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu had been rude first, so he could demand a higher price, but she had offered compensation. He also had to consider the face of Holy Venerable Huiguang, who had mediated, and couldn't be too excessive.</p><p>After some thought, Huashen said, “I obtained the Water Phase Hall's alchemy inheritance in the Formless Immortal Sect. The senior who created the Soul Calming Incense may also have originated from the Formless Immortal Sect. Perhaps this will be helpful in refining the Soul Calming Incense.”</p><p>Holy King Qinghu's beautiful eyes flitted about, watching Huashen's selection with amusement.  Upon hearing his words, she didn't even blink.  “Traded.”</p><p>“And the main ingredient for the Soul Calming Incense, including two Myriad Spirit Fruits…”</p><p>There were three Myriad Spirit Fruits remaining, and he intended to offer two.</p><p>Before Huashen could finish, Holy King Qinghu decisively said, “All traded.”</p><p>Both parties were inclined to trade, and the subsequent process went smoothly. Huashen acquired the *Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture*, the Seventh Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo, and requested Holy King Qinghu to move the Ancient Spirit Gathering Array.</p><p>He used the Myriad Spirit Fruits and other previously collected spirit herbs to exchange for the Seven Star Root, and asked Holy King Qinghu to help search for the various spirit herbs and core spirit materials required by the *Panhu True Scripture* and for the Taiji Immortal Platform.</p><p>He could collect the Icefire Tokens slowly.</p><p>This act had the air of aiding the enemy, but Qin Sang didn't care how strong his opponents were. As long as he continued to progress, he would eventually catch up and surpass them!</p><p>“Once the Myriad Mile Azure Sky Array is set up, I will inform my true body to deliver the elixir formula and treasures,” Huashen bowed slightly and descended the mountain, his hands full.</p><p>Watching Huashen's figure disappear among the mountains,</p><p>Holy King Qinghu chuckled playfully. “I thought I would need to exert some effort to subtly slip him the *Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture*.  I didn't expect him to choose it directly, saving me the trouble.”</p><p>She turned her head to look at Holy Venerable Huiguang. “It is said that Outer Realm Heavenly Devils are attracted when cultivators undergo the Void Refining Tribulation, due to the intensity of the tribulation and the resulting tremors in heaven and earth, which draw the gaze of outer evils.  During the Heart Devil Tribulation, Outer Realm Heavenly Devils may intrude.  Cultivators all fear the Heavenly Devil.  Yet, someone actually dares to actively invite the Heavenly Devil in. Old Monk, are you sure you haven't manipulated anything? Aren't you afraid he'll sense something amiss and shelve the scripture?”</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang replied, “This technique is a Nascent Soul secret technique. I don't possess the ability to alter it. Any alteration would leave flaws that could be easily detected.  In ancient times, there were ascetic Buddhist cultivators with iron wills who dared to actively utilize Outer Realm Heavenly Devils to identify weaknesses in their own nature, seeking perfect enlightenment. This scripture arose from that practice.  However, this scripture focuses more on strengthening divine sense.  Since it doesn't dare to truly invite the Heavenly Devil, its effectiveness in tempering one's nature is greatly diminished.”</p><p>“You suspect the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound is related to the Outer Realm Heavenly Devils?”</p><p>Holy King Qinghu clicked her tongue in admiration.</p><p>“What a venomous scheme!</p><p>“That person's divine sense far surpasses his peers, even exceeding his own cultivation level. Even if he isn't a Spirit Cultivator, his attainments in the spiritual arts must be profound. Perhaps his divine sense will leap ahead first, rivaling that of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>“Now it seems the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound must be compatible with the Heavenly Dao. Unless he breaks through to the Nascent Soul stage and achieves communion with heaven, even with increased divine sense, he won't be able to perceive the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound.</p><p>“If he breaks through to Nascent Soul, he will certainly perish during the Heart Devil Tribulation.</p><p>“If he fails to break through and is trapped by the bottleneck, with nowhere to turn, he will surely think of the *Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture* to further strengthen his divine sense, seeking a breakthrough opportunity.  At that time, if he invites the Heavenly Devil in, and if your conjecture is correct, that the Outer Realm Heavenly Devil is the source of the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound, what he attracts won't be a strand of demonic nature, but the gaze of the Heavenly Devil itself!</p><p>“If he suddenly dies, you can use this to confirm the source of the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound.</p><p>“Even if the changes in this realm are unrelated to the Outer Realm Heavenly Devils, with the Heavenly Devil's demonic nature within him, if the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound continues to intensify, he will undoubtedly be the first affected. His demonic nature will erupt, and he will surely perish.</p><p>“Spirit Cultivators are rare in this world. Those who know of the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound wouldn't dare to cultivate this technique. He is a rare exception. Indeed, no one is more suitable than him.</p><p>“Old Monk, you truly hold deep apprehension towards him.  If he can't reach Nascent Soul, you don't intend to let him live!”</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang rolled his prayer beads, his eyes closed in silence.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu sighed, “In the past, although I didn't see eye to eye with you, I still considered your actions grand and upright.  When did you resort to such shady tricks and underhanded schemes?”</p><p>Finally, Holy King Qinghu shook her head, offering her assessment, “Anxious and apprehensive—nothing more. Too many attachments are truly not a good thing.”</p><p>……</p><p>Far away in the Luye wilderness of the Northern Wastelands,</p><p>Qin Sang's true body wasn't cultivating at this moment.  Instead, he was constantly deducing something, the *Lifeless Demonic Seal* gifted to him by Senior Sister Qingjun surfacing in his mind.</p><p>Since obtaining this secret technique, Qin Sang had harbored a certain thought, but despite searching throughout the North Sea and the Middle Continent, he hadn't found any cultivation methods or secret techniques that could validate his idea.</p><p>The Outer Realm Heavenly Devil, also known as the External Form Heavenly Devil, was a terrifying existence capable of transforming into a cultivator's heart devil, killing silently and invisibly.</p><p>If the inner devil remains dormant,</p><p>what harm can the outer devil do?</p>
