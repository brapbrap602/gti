Chapter 595: The Killing Talismans

“These two Killing Talismans are the culmination of my life's work, created as I strived to mend my cultivation method.  Regrettably, they remain incomplete. After honing my skills on the Sword Path and gaining new insights, I was pursued by a powerful enemy and forced to flee, my future uncertain. If any descendant comes here, I hope they will inherit my will and continue tirelessly forward. May the might of the Killing Sword Scripture be revived one day…”

At the end, the name 'Qingzhu' was carved with sword Qi.

The inscription was messy, hastily etched with sword energy.

Clearly, the writer was in dire straits, just as the message stated, pursued by an enemy and forced to escape through an ancient teleportation formation.

Uncertain of the dangers on the other side and fearing a one-way trip, with the loss of his life's work – the Killing Talismans – he left them behind before his departure.

He hoped that a future cultivator of the "Divine Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter," upon discovering this ancient hall, would use the talismans as a foundation to further mend the cultivation method and bring this unique art back to light.

This was an act of great generosity, guiding those who would follow.

Perhaps it was also an expression of his unwillingness to leave, leaving a mark in the Small Cold Realm to prove he had been there.

Qin Sang finished reading the inscription, filled with respect.

He was grateful for Qingzhu's selflessness and amazed by his talent.

Despite the incomplete cultivation method, a dead end with no guidance, Qingzhu hadn't switched to another method.  Instead, he persevered and, against all odds, single-handedly created two Killing Talismans, forging a new path.

Two talismans represented two levels of the cultivation method.

This meant Qingzhu's cultivation level, before his departure, was at least late Core Formation.

Yet, he was pursued by a powerful enemy, unable to fight back, and forced to activate the ancient teleportation formation to an unknown destination.

Was his enemy a Nascent Soul Grandmaster?

Qin Sang didn't know the details, but from the stories he'd heard about Qingzhu and the few words from Granny Jing, he could piece together some possibilities.

Qingzhu had betrayed Lesser Hua Mountain for a woman, but the sect hadn't pursued him.

His only known enemy was the Yuan Mirage Sect, and Qin Sang suspected the mastermind was most likely Leng Yuntian.

Leng Yuntian had been severely injured at the Violet Citadel years ago and hadn't recovered. He had forcefully formed his Nascent Soul, resulting in only a pseudo-Nascent Soul level of power. Could Qingzhu have been the one who injured him?

Did he ambush Leng Yuntian at the Violet Citadel for revenge?

If so, the one pursuing Qingzhu was likely Leng Qian, the Yuan Mirage Sect Master at the time!

Shortly after the Violet Citadel's reappearance, Leng Qian had died of old age. He must have already been grooming Leng Yuntian as his successor.

Leng Qian had invested countless resources in cultivating his heir.  How could he not be enraged when that heir was nearly killed? He would have wanted to tear the culprit apart.

However, these were just Qin Sang's speculations.

Only those involved knew what truly happened.

The two Killing Talismans were meticulously carved, with sword韵 flowing and killing intent concealed, consistent with the first five levels of the "Divine Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter."

However, upon closer examination of the talismans' contents, Qin Sang discovered differences.

The talismans contained much of Qingzhu's own insights, his understanding of the Dao unconsciously woven into them during their creation.

The "Divine Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter" was simple yet all-encompassing, allowing each cultivator to derive their own unique path and find what suited them best.

Qingzhu's self-created method, however, was narrower, best suited for himself.

This was related to cultivation level and perspective. The creator of the "Divine Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter" must have been an unparalleled master, while Qingzhu was just a Core Formation cultivator.

There was a vast difference between them.

That Qingzhu had reached this point was already remarkable, a talent rarely seen in a millennium!

Therefore, even if another cultivator of the "Divine Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter" came here, it would be difficult for them to follow Qingzhu's path exactly.

Modifications would be necessary to align with their own nature. Otherwise, as their cultivation grew, the divergence from their own Dao could lead to the risk of Qi deviation.

But Qin Sang was different. He knew he only wanted to increase his cultivation quickly.

He treated cultivation methods as tools, using the talismans solely for advancement.  His mind, shielded by the Jade Buddha, remained unaffected. Even a different path wouldn't impact his nature, let alone minor alterations.

Once he reached mid-Core Formation, he could follow Qingzhu's path faithfully without needing to modify the talismans.

Qin Sang, eyes fixed, memorized the talismans, comprehending the subsequent levels of the cultivation method.

Despite being Qingzhu's creation, it was still incredibly profound.  Much of it was beyond Qin Sang's current understanding, but even with his limited insight, he could tell this path was viable!

Qin Sang quickly memorized the first talisman and then shifted his gaze to the second, his eyes narrowing slightly.

This talisman was incomplete, seemingly lacking the final stroke!

Looking at the cultivation essence within, it was indeed missing a part.

The regret Qingzhu mentioned in his message must have referred to this missing stroke. It seemed his cultivation was very close to the peak of late Core Formation, only the final part eluding him, a hair's breadth from Nascent Soul.

After trials on the Sword Path, Qingzhu had gained new insights and finally been able to complete it, but it was too late.

What a pity!

Qin Sang's sigh echoed through the ancient hall.

Although seemingly just a single stroke, it couldn't be underestimated or carelessly inscribed.

The entire talisman had to be perfectly harmonious. Any mistake could cause the talisman to collapse, resulting in a drastic drop in cultivation or even the shattering of the Ebony Sword.

Qin Sang memorized both talismans, calmed himself, and let go of his regret.

Obtaining Qingzhu's self-created cultivation method was already a great fortune.  These two talismans were enough to support his cultivation to late Core Formation.  With so much time, perhaps other opportunities would arise.

At worst, he could enter closed-door cultivation and deduce the method himself.

It was only a single stroke. No matter how dull his talent, he could find a solution.

Having memorized the talismans, Qin Sang bowed to Qingzhu's message, expressing his gratitude for the guidance.  He then turned to the ancient teleportation formation at the center of the altar, a contemplative look on his face.

Neither the ancient hall nor the Sword Path held Qingzhu's remains, indicating he had successfully teleported away.

This meant the ancient formation was functional back then.

But whether it still worked now was uncertain.

Qin Sang asked himself, if he were in Qingzhu's shoes, pursued by a Nascent Soul Grandmaster and on the verge of death, the first thing he would do after teleporting would be to destroy the formation on the other side.

Although the ancient hall's Sword Path was powerful, it might not be able to stop a Nascent Soul Grandmaster. Only by destroying the teleportation formation could the threat be eliminated.

Doing so would also cut off his own retreat, potentially trapping him forever, but those were concerns for later.

This ancient teleportation formation was likely unusable.

After a moment of thought, Qin Sang retrieved eight mid-grade spirit stones from his Qianjun Ring.
