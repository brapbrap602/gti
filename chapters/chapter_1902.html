Chapter 1893: Driving the Tiger to Swallow the Wolf


Demonic intent descended from the Heavenly Demon!

Qin Sang's body, already controlled by the shadowy figure, was incapable of any action.

Summoning a Heavenly Demon, driving the tiger to swallow the wolf, was fraught with peril, akin to playing with fire.

A Heavenly Demon, a Nascent Soul cultivator, two formidable powers, both enigmatic and unpredictable, coexisted within his body.

Qin Sang was unsure if he could survive this tribulation, but he had no other choice, only to seek survival amidst death!

The Jade Buddha's performance in resisting the Thunder Ancestor's power gave Qin Sang some confidence.

The reality, however, was far more grim than Qin Sang anticipated.

This could no longer be called demonic intent; it could be described as demonic obsession, even a fragment of the Heavenly Demon's soul!

The demonic intent summoned earlier, compared to this, was utterly insignificant.

Faced with such terrifying demonic intent, any ordinary person would have lost their mind, trapped in an endless illusion of inner demons.

Fortunately, Qin Sang's consciousness remained clear. Sensing the perilous situation, he unhesitatingly dispersed the altar, interrupting the summoning ritual, attempting to sever the connection.

In the ethereal realm, it seemed as if an immensely evil and dangerous entity was about to cast its gaze upon him, far more terrifying than the enemy before him.

If the Heavenly Demon's true body were summoned, his enemy would indeed perish, but he himself would have no chance of survival.

The shadowy figure's performance was sufficient proof that the Jade Buddha had its limitations against peak cultivators!

Would this action be effective?

Qin Sang didn't know.

He dared not release the slightest wisp of divine sense to perceive the outside situation.

Few in the world could be like Qin Sang, when invaded by an extraterrestrial Heavenly Demon, not only remaining conscious but also able to carefully experience the changes brought about by the demonic intent.

However, this was an experience Qin Sang had no desire to repeat.

A chilling aura enveloped his entire body, his blood seemingly frozen, losing all sensation.

Faintly, a strange aura lingered outside the Jade Buddha's radiant light, yet it couldn't penetrate the divine radiance.

Some rejoiced, others despaired.

When the ritual was completed, the shadowy figure and Qin Sang simultaneously sensed the aura of the Heavenly Demon's demonic intent.

This aura was all too familiar to the shadowy figure.

He never imagined that Qin Sang, clearly not a follower of the Heavenly Demon, could summon one, dared to summon one, and the one summoned was no ordinary extraterrestrial Heavenly Demon!

At his peak, he might have been able to resist the demonic intent's invasion.

At this moment, however, he was in an unprecedentedly weakened state.

Before intruding into the Divine Court, he had already suffered grievous injuries, abandoning his physical body.

When forcibly sent into the Divine Court, during the passage through the Divine Court's barrier, he also endured unimaginable pressure.

The one who blasted open the Divine Court's barrier and sent him in was unable to protect him further.

The passage formed by the palm print harbored dangers far more terrifying than a void storm, adding insult to injury.

After entering the Divine Court, in order to seize the Emperor's Sword and obtain its secrets before others reacted, the shadowy figure had no time for recovery or adjustments, dragging his heavily injured form to forcibly seize Qin Sang!

The Heavenly Demon was insidious and pervasive.

The Nascent Soul's severe injuries and his eagerness for quick success exposed flaws in his state of mind, giving the Heavenly Demon an opportune moment.

Within the Purple Mansion.

The shadowy figure stood motionless before Qin Sang's Nascent Soul, his expression changing from shock to hatred, then to ecstasy, pain, bliss…

A myriad of expressions flitted across his face.

As if he had experienced countless lifetimes in an instant.

Unexpectedly, the shadowy figure proved formidable.  A painful struggle flashed in his eyes, and he let out a silent roar, actually wresting a sliver of clarity. With a ferocious expression, he retreated recklessly.

Qin Sang's eyes were wide, his expression vacant, like a corpse with eyes wide open in death.

Suddenly, his face was awash in blood.

Dense, thread-like streams of blood gushed from his forehead and eyes, faintly revealing a distorted human figure.

The shadowy figure exited Qin Sang's body in the same manner he entered.

However, as the bloody light left his body, a chilling demonic intent clung tightly to it, like a persistent affliction.

"Ah!"

A scream reverberated through the Divine Court.

Having escaped Qin Sang's Purple Mansion, the shadowy figure still couldn't shake off the Heavenly Demon's demonic intent!

The scream was incredibly piercing and bizarre, a single sound seemingly containing countless emotions, and an unshakeable fear…

Immortal clouds trembled.

The scream reached Qin Sang's ears.

Qin Sang was startled awake, finding he had regained control of his body.  The chilling aura that enveloped him receded like a tide.  His eyes moved slightly, and he witnessed a grotesque scene.

A mass of blood plasma floated before him, twisting and contorting, bearing no resemblance to a human form.

The screams emanated from the 'blood plasma,' the aura indicating it was the shadowy figure who had attacked him.

However, the aura of the Heavenly Demon also resided within the blood plasma!

"The demonic intent couldn't breach the radiant barrier, changed its target, locked onto the shadowy figure, and chased him out?"

Qin Sang was unclear about the specific details and could only speculate.

"The shadowy figure is so vulnerable, is it merely demonic intent, or is the true body of the Heavenly Demon attempting to taint him?  If the Heavenly Demon descends through the shadowy figure, what should I do?"

He might have summoned something even more formidable, adding fuel to the already chaotic situation.

When the crisis struck, Qin Sang couldn't ponder too deeply, but now he felt a sense of lingering fear.

However, regardless, this was the best outcome he could have hoped for!

Just then, Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, filled with unease.

'Whoosh!'

Qin Sang instinctively retreated, and his vision was instantly filled with a torrential blood-red light.

The blood plasma transformed into a distorted human silhouette, its body composed of countless blood threads.

At the core of the blood threads, a point of crimson light was particularly distinct.

This crimson light was incredibly pure, starkly contrasting with the chaotic blood-red light emitted by the shadowy figure.

With the appearance of the crimson light, the shadowy figure became even more distorted.

The crimson light seemed to possess a devouring ability, the blood threads within the shadowy figure frantically converging towards it, then being absorbed.

The shadowy figure, which had barely maintained a human form, quickly reverted to a mass of blood plasma.

The crimson light grew increasingly bright and dazzling, finally transforming into a fingernail-sized crimson crystal.

The blood crystal was pure and flawless, captivating to the eye.

The source of Qin Sang's unease was precisely this object.

"Dangerous!"

Qin Sang's expression changed drastically.

'Crack!'

The blood crystal shattered, fragments scattering in all directions, transforming into clusters of blood flames that filled the sky and covered the earth.

In an instant, the blood crystal transformed the surroundings into a sea of crimson flames, the raging fire dyeing the Divine Court a demonic scarlet.

'Whoosh!'

Blood flames surged.

Endless blood flames erupted.

Fortunately, Qin Sang reacted quickly enough, barely escaping the range of the blood flames.  Gazing at the edge of the inferno, he could sense a power that made his heart tremble.

The shadowy figure vanished within the blood flames.

The demonic intent of the Heavenly Demon was similarly swallowed by the blood flames.

Faintly, a furious roar filled with resentment seemed to emanate from the depths of the sea of blood.

"Hiss…"

Qin Sang gasped, his scalp tingling, grateful that this power hadn't erupted within his body, otherwise, he would have been reduced to ashes.

He stared intently at the depths of the blood flames, noticing that the eruption was but a fleeting moment, its recession equally swift.

The sea of fire rapidly contracted inwards.

"It seems… the aura of the Heavenly Demon has vanished?"

Qin Sang could no longer sense that peculiar chilling aura. The shadowy figure was more powerful than he had imagined.

However, Qin Sang still felt that the blood crystal wasn't the shadowy figure's own power, either a unique treasure or an even more terrifying entity backing him.

For Qin Sang, the eradication of the demonic intent wasn't necessarily a good thing.

The best outcome would have been the mutual destruction of the shadowy figure and the demonic intent; otherwise, the crisis remained unresolved.

Unfortunately, things rarely went as planned.

As the blood flames subsided, the scene within the inferno gradually revealed itself, the mass of blood plasma still pulsating!

"He's still alive!"

Qin Sang's heart lurched, nearly succumbing to despair.

In this situation, where could he escape to?

Having lost the Divine Chariot, he couldn't escape the Southern Heavenly Gate in the short term, nor could he enter any of the divine halls for refuge.

Faced with the shadowy figure's bizarre magical powers, the Thunder Escape Technique was useless.

Because of this, Qin Sang didn't make any futile attempts, continuing to observe the blood plasma, soon noticing something amiss.

"Something's wrong!"

Qin Sang perceived that the aura of the blood plasma was significantly weaker than before; the blood crystal had taken a heavy toll on him.

Clearly, detonating the blood crystal to annihilate the demonic intent had come at a considerable cost to the shadowy figure.

The blood plasma struggled to reform into a human shape.

Moreover, the aura and intent Qin Sang sensed from it remained incredibly chaotic, bordering on madness.

"It's an illusion of inner demons!  He was driven into an illusion of inner demons by the demonic intent, and he's still trapped within it!"

Qin Sang immediately understood.

"An opportunity!"

Undoubtedly, this was a golden opportunity.

Qin Sang didn't hesitate for a moment.  He raised a hand and pointed towards the sky, and thunder rumbled deafeningly.

He once again cast the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal.

Thunder techniques were particularly effective against evil and might have a miraculous effect.

Casting it now, its power was far from comparable to before, yet Qin Sang felt an unprecedented ease and fluidity.

This was one of the benefits of being infused with the Thunder Ancestor's power. Qin Sang's comprehension of the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal had reached a new level.

'Crack!'

Thunder transformed into a seal, lightning illuminating the heavens.

A thunderbolt descended from the sky, striking the blood plasma fiercely.

The blood plasma was pierced by the thunderbolt, emitting a piercing shriek.  However, after a period of contortion, it re-coalesced, not yet destroyed.

Qin Sang's pupils constricted. He hadn't expected the shadowy figure to be so difficult to kill even while trapped within an illusion of inner demons.

Moreover, this thunderbolt seemed to have had the opposite effect, as the shadowy figure showed signs of breaking free from the illusion.

Qin Sang's eyes flashed with killing intent.  Once the shadowy figure escaped the illusion, who knew what other bizarre methods he might possess!

'Whoosh!'

The Nine Nether Demonic Flames left his body, transforming into a sky full of black flames, encircling the blood plasma.

Sword intent also filled the air, the Cloudroaming Sword forming the Seven Souls Killing Formation, sword light poised to strike.

Qin Sang's body trembled, enveloped in radiant light, preparing to unleash the Sun Wheel Seal.

…

Just as Qin Sang was about to unleash all his magical powers in a torrential assault, he was suddenly alerted by another phenomenon.

The palm print!

Qin Sang looked over in astonishment.

The void and the Divine Court's barrier were repairing themselves, the palm print losing its power. The blood pool was shrinking with the passage of time, smaller than before, yet the fluctuations emanating from it grew increasingly violent.

The scene within the blood pool was nauseating.

When he saw the source of the fluctuations in the depths of the blood pool, Qin Sang's expression changed dramatically once more.

There were two sources of the fluctuations.

One could faintly discern a yellow aura fiercely surging towards the outside of the blood pool, gradually creating a whirlpool within it.

Within that yellow aura, countless human heads floated, constantly appearing and disappearing, like a ghostly smoke refined from innumerable souls, or like the legendary Yellow Springs.

Even more bizarre, the faces on these heads were identical.

The same face displayed entirely different expressions, some laughing, some crying, some screaming.

As they surged outwards, heads constantly annihilated, the yellow aura also visibly shrinking, severely damaged.

Yet, the yellow aura showed no signs of stopping, the heads seemingly endless.

The other source was even more disturbing.

There, a black profound light, like an arrow, aimed towards the Divine Court outside the blood pool.

Within the profound light, there was only one person.

This person wore nothing, their skin smooth and jade-like.

Their hands were clasped against their chest.

Every so often, their skin would crack under the immense pressure, resembling shattered porcelain.

At these times, they would pierce their fingers into their body, expressionless, tearing off this layer of skin, like a snake shedding its skin, discarding it.

Layers of human skin were flung off, turning into dust.

…

Qin Sang couldn't clearly see within the blood pool, but he could sense two auras attempting to force their way into the Divine Court.

Judging by the scene within the blood pool, these two auras showed no signs of dissipating.

Passing through the blood pool and entering the Divine Court was only a matter of time!

To be able to traverse the blood pool and survive, the newcomers' strength was likely no less than the shadowy figure's.

How could Qin Sang not be alarmed!

A single shadowy figure had pushed him to this point; how could he cope with two more?

Should he summon another Heavenly Demon?

Even if he slew the shadowy figure, he himself would still hardly escape doom.

This situation was utterly hopeless.

Qin Sang looked around blankly.

A sea of clouds stretched endlessly, immortal mountains and divine halls appearing and disappearing intermittently.

He saw neither the Dao Court True Monarch nor Celestial Master Tian Yue, not a single reinforcement in sight.

In this vast Divine Court, apart from him, all were enemies.  And these enemies were all so powerful, powerful to the point of despair.

Looking up at the sky, layers upon layers of Nine Heavens Immortal Clouds obstructed the path between him and the Thunder Ancestor's Divine Hall.

At this moment, Qin Sang desperately yearned for that unparalleled, formidable power.

Perhaps he should perish together with the shadowy figure, taking at least one down with him!

A fierce glint appeared in Qin Sang's eyes, but a persistent belief within his heart countered all negative thoughts.

How could he give up!

He cultivated for this life, seeking the Immortal Dao. What meaning would there be in dragging his enemies down with him to the underworld if his own soul returned to the netherworld!

Qin Sang took a deep breath, suddenly ceasing all attacks.

The thunder seal in the sky vanished, the lightning dispersed.

The Nine Nether Demonic Flames paused briefly before swiftly retreating, merging into Qin Sang's forehead.

His internal qi and blood calmed, the outline of the sun behind him also dissipating.

…

Only the Cloudroaming Sword remained unsheathed, but it dispersed the Seven Souls Killing Formation, replacing it with the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation.

In the blink of an eye, darkness and stars enveloped the space.

The blood plasma was incorporated into the sword formation, like a beating heart, the shadowy figure still immersed in the illusion of inner demons.

Qin Sang's time was running out.  He only managed to manifest the Western White Tiger's seven lunar mansions, temporarily trapping the figure within the sword formation.

'Whoosh!'

Having accomplished this, Qin Sang turned his gaze to the side.

Two charred corpses floated in the sea of clouds, the remains of the Azure Scaled Serpent and the Black Roc.

The two demons were too close to Qin Sang.  Merely enduring the residual waves of the Thunder Ancestor's heavenly thunder had left their corpses beyond recognition.

He raised a hand, aiming at one of the demonic corpses, and made a grasping motion in the air.

The demon's skull split open, and a demon core flew out.

'Swoosh!'

The demon core landed in his hand.

This core was multicolored, vibrant and beautiful.

A breathtakingly beautiful core, yet containing a potent poison!

This was the demon core of a Void Refinement stage Demon King. For any ordinary person, merely inhaling the aura of the demon core would induce dizziness and vertigo.

Qin Sang took a deep breath, steeled his resolve, and swallowed it!
