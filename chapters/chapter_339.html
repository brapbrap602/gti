Chapter 332: Tracking


The exchange concluded faster than the auction, ending within an hour.
Both host and guests were pleased.
The old man made a killing, beaming at everyone.
The group left through a hidden passage.  They emerged not in the same stone house they'd entered, but in a small alley, revealing the old man's caution.
Leaving the alley, the group silently dispersed.
Despite her strong showing at the secret market, Qin Sang knew she hadn't deterred truly skilled cultivators.  She remained vigilant, wary of being followed.
The night was moonless.
Even cultivators were influenced by the daily rhythms of mortals, rarely moving at night unless necessary.  They returned to their rented stone houses for cultivation.
A massive figure suddenly appeared in the silent alley—the masked strongman.
The strongman's actions belied his imposing size; he moved cautiously, glancing back repeatedly, his eyes unusually alert, behaving like a timid mouse.
The alley led directly to the edge of the stone island.
Reaching the island's edge without incident, the strongman swiftly used his escape technique to blend into the night, silently leaving the island.
Shortly after the strongman departed, the space at the end of the alley rippled, revealing a blurry figure that quickly transformed into a faint glow, giving chase.
However, this person hadn't anticipated a third party.
After he left, another person appeared in the same spot: Qin Sang. He gazed at the deep swamp, pondering for a moment before silently departing using the newly acquired You Luo Cloud.
The alley, scene to three individuals' movements, finally fell quiet.


The sudden feeling of familiarity outside the auction house hadn't initially concerned Qin Sang; it was fleeting and abrupt.
But at the secret market, the strongman's unintentionally revealed true voice triggered that familiarity again, awakening a very distant memory—one from decades ago!
The voice wasn't exactly the same; time changes people.
They grow older.
However, for cultivators, this change is much slower than for mortals.
Because of this, the voice, though now rougher and more weathered, still retained a core tone Qin Sang recognized.
Searching his memories, Qin Sang suddenly recalled someone he'd never expected.
Tan Hao!
In You Shan Market, Tan Hao had bravely spoken up, helping Qin Sang rebuke a dishonest merchant, allowing him to purchase the *You Ming Scripture* with its accompanying spell at a low price.
After they both joined Kui Yin Sect, Tan Hao dedicated himself to cultivation in his cave dwelling, rarely appearing.
Qin Sang was close to Tan Hao's younger brother, Tan Jie, but wasn't particularly familiar with Tan Hao himself.
The more Qin Sang considered it, the more Tan Hao seemed like the likely candidate. Tan Hao had been exceptionally tall as a youth, a stark contrast to his brother, and would surely be even more imposing as an adult.
But this astonished Qin Sang. How could it be him?
After the Kui Yin Sect's failed invasion of Yuan Zhao Sect, the sect scattered.  Tan Hao and Tan Jie weren't sent to Yuan Zhao Sect as spies, nor were they chosen as sacrifices like Shi Hong.
With the Kui Yin Sect's destruction, the Yin Sha Abyss was unleashed, and Yuan Zhao Sect wouldn't relentlessly hunt down low-level disciples.  They did have a chance to escape.
But escape didn't guarantee survival; that was the cruelty of the Kui Yin Sect and the Yan Luo Banner.
Those who had used the Yan Luo Banner for cultivation only had two paths left.
One was to cultivate to the tenth level of Qi Refinement and be consumed by the Yan Luo, becoming the banner's main spirit; the other was to discover the banner's flaw early and abandon their cultivation to start anew.
At the time of the Kui Yin Sect's destruction, Tan Hao was over twenty. With his talent, if he had abandoned his cultivation and become a loose cultivator again, the possibility of him reaching the Foundation Establishment stage was practically zero.
Furthermore, even if Tan Hao had discovered the Yan Luo Banner's abnormality, he might not have abandoned it; the temptation of soul-cultivation wasn't something everyone could resist.
If Sun De hadn't approached him, Qin Sang might never have understood the secrets of the Yan Luo Banner.
Qin Sang had assumed Tan Jie, Shi Hong, and others were dead.  Finding someone who resembled Tan Hao was both surprising and somewhat joyous.
He hadn't made many friends since entering the immortal path, and he had been close to Tan Jie and Shi Hong in the Kui Yin Sect.
A reunion with an old friend—but Qin Sang didn't rush to reveal himself.
Firstly, he was now a disciple of Shao Hua Mountain and couldn't reveal his past with the Kui Yin Sect. Even if he recognized a friend, he'd need a disguise.


Years have passed.  Is Tan Hao still the same? Has his nature changed? Is he still the righteous youth who helped those in need?

The brutal assassination a year ago is still vivid in my memory.

The drastic changes in Daiyue are not his true nature; he's been driven to this by a bottleneck in his cultivation.

In the immortal cultivation world, there are countless others like Daiyue.

More importantly, is Tan Hao still connected to the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect?

Tan Hao's unusual cultivation level makes Qin Sang wary, so he decides to follow him and observe his current situation.

His experiences at the auction and the secret market clearly show that Tan Hao's immortal path hasn't been smooth. He likely suffered soul injuries, spending everything he had on healing pills, much like Yun Youzi.

However, Tan Hao is far more impoverished than Yun Youzi. He doesn't have the Taiyi Danzong to rely on, and his magical artifacts are several levels lower than Yun Youzi's.

In the struggle for the Jing Shen Pill, the best artifact he could produce in a hurry was merely a high-grade artifact.

Qin Sang remembers Tan Hao's righteous act at the You Shan Market.  If possible, he won't hesitate to lend a hand.

Besides, there's another reason. If Tan Hao is still connected to the Kuiyin Sect, Qin Sang can use him to find the sect's remnants.

Having broken through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, with several magical artifacts and a talisman treasure, he is no longer a weakling. Unless he encounters a Nascent Soul stage Kuiyin Sect fiend, the outcome is uncertain.

The sooner the Shixin insect problem is resolved, the better.

And the Yanluo Banners; he only has six. Finding the Kuiyin Sect remnants might allow him to collect the full ten and complete the Ten Directions Yanluo Formation.

…

While following Tan Hao, Qin Sang notices something amiss.  Upon closer observation, he discovers another person secretly trailing Tan Hao.

The masked man who competed with Tan Hao for the Jing Shen Pill.

The masked man's intentions are obvious.

At the time, the masked man swiftly abandoned the Jing Shen Pill. Qin Sang didn't realize his malicious intent.  Indeed, biting dogs don't bark.

The masked man carefully tracks Tan Hao, never expecting a fellow follower.

Qin Sang immediately changes his strategy, targeting the masked man instead.

Three figures, forming a strange formation, leave the stone island and enter the chaotic swamp.
