<h1>Chapter 1229:  Respite</h1><p>Chapter 1229:  Respite</p><p>Stone Curve Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang, receiving the message, hurried there without delay.</p><p>“It’s unclear what the ancient cultivators used to support the spirit array. I’ve refined a few array implements and a diagram, barely restoring a portion…”</p><p>Qing Jun came out, took out several items, and handed them to Qin Sang.</p><p>There was a diagram made from some unknown hide.</p><p>The square diagram, when not activated, was only palm-sized.  Lines were inscribed on it with cinnabar, identical to the pattern Qin Sang had copied before.</p><p>A strange power flowed within the pattern, its fluctuations resonating with the Demon Binding Rope in Qing Jun's hand.</p><p>The other array implements were all designed to work with the diagram, maximizing the power of the Demon Binding Rope.</p><p>“You mentioned before that I should consult your friend who practices corpse cultivation. I specifically went back to the Yuan Shen Gate to see him, and he did give me quite a few suggestions, many I hadn't thought of…Do you know his background?”</p><p>Qing Jun recalled something, and asked curiously.</p><p>Before giving the Demon Binding Rope to Qing Jun, Qin Sang had planned to ask Bai to restore it after his breakthrough, hence the suggestion of a greater chance of success if they worked together.</p><p>He didn’t know when Qing Jun had returned; Bai hadn’t mentioned him last time.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression shifted slightly. Bai and Qing Jun had little interaction, and even with him as an intermediary, trust between them was unlikely.</p><p>Bai had used a disguised identity when he visited Qing Jun after leaving Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Qing Jun didn't know Bai's true origins.</p><p>Bai himself didn't wish to reveal himself, and Qin Sang couldn't betray his secret, so he vaguely said, “Involving these ancient secrets, Brother Bai wouldn't act without reason.”</p><p>Qing Jun thought for a moment, nodded, and didn't press further.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the diagram, unable to discern its quality. He left the room, took out a demonic banner, “Let's try…”</p><p>A demonic fire flew out from the banner.</p><p>Qing Jun understood, threw up the Demon Binding Rope, and then pinched a hand seal. The diagram flew from Qin Sang's palm, instantly enlarging to the size of a few acres, and the array implements merged into it.</p><p>The diagram spun rapidly, hovering below the Demon Binding Rope. The previously rigid Demon Binding Rope instantly came alive, twisting and changing, making a whooshing sound.</p><p>Smoke rose in the courtyard.</p><p>The diagram's physical form disappeared, transforming into a misty realm.</p><p>Qing Jun changed her hand seal again.</p><p>Dozens of identical illusory Demon Binding Ropes emerged from the mist, like black pythons, suddenly springing up and attacking the demonic fire without hesitation.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack!’</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the demonic fire was firmly trapped by the Demon Binding Ropes, shrinking into a ball.</p><p>Qing Jun waved her hand, retrieving the Demon Binding Rope and the diagram. After a moment of contemplation, she said, “The Demon Binding Rope does indeed have the power to restrain demonic fire, but this is certainly not its full power; it needs further improvement.  Also, deploying the diagram and activating the Demon Binding Rope takes time, enough for the enemy to react, escape, or destroy it. Unless pre-deployed, it will be difficult to use in battle, and that also needs improvement.”</p><p>Seeing that Qing Jun had clearly pointed out the flaws, Qin Sang offered some of his own ideas.</p><p>He had considerable skill in refining, and he had also browsed the treasures of the Yuan Shen Gate, which should inspire his senior sister.</p><p>The two discussed for a long time, not only about the Demon Binding Rope, but also about the Blood Lake expedition.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang returned to Sandie Pass.</p><p>For the next year, Qin Sang rarely left Sandie Pass, dedicating himself to cultivation day and night. He temporarily stopped body refinement, focusing instead on refining the demonic fire to nurture the Fire Lotus Seed.</p><p>The 《Cultivating the Divine Soul with Swords》chapter never stopped.</p><p>No matter how powerful these secret techniques were, they were merely superficial; the fundamental improvement lay in realm enhancement.</p><p>A year passed uneventfully.</p><p>News from the Boundless Valley was frequent, the Blood Lake seal was continuously vibrating, but showed no signs of loosening.</p><p>The war entered a prolonged stalemate. Qin Sang had to admire the patience of the Abyss cultivators; despite little gain, they remained on the Sky Walk Plateau, occasionally harassing, treating the battlefield as a training ground.</p><p>He wondered if this was to tie down the cultivators from both realms.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't fathom the Abyss' intentions, so he stopped trying to.</p><p>His purpose in entering the Blood Lake was twofold: to find the Thunder Swallowing Falcon, and to search for any scattered fragments of the Intertwined Blood Mulberry;  defeating Ye Lao Mo's plot was secondary.</p><p>If the situation became untenable, Qin Sang certainly wouldn't risk his life.  With the eighteen demonic banners protecting him, even Ye Lao Mo couldn’t stop him if he wanted to leave. Lao Ma Hou and the others had already found a suitable cave abode overseas; at worst, he could relocate his juniors and become an island king.</p><p>However, this would make entering the Ziwei Palace very difficult.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang was reluctant to leave Xiaohan Region unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Several months passed, and cultivators stationed at Wuyagu finally sent back confirmed news: the Blood Lake seal was weakening and would soon break.  Tongyou Mojun and others decided to intervene after deliberation, lest Ye Laomo employ some trickery to slip in before the seal broke.</p><p>Qin Sang received a message from his senior sister. Instead of joining them at Bingjing Palace, he summoned Pang Ji and proceeded to Wuyagu ahead of the others.  For this, Qin Sang used several precious spiritual materials to refine the Hun Yuan Tongxin Ring again, so it could hold Pang Ji.</p><p>The blood miasma outside Wuyagu was no longer a concern for Qin Sang.</p><p>Time was ample.</p><p>Remembering that the strange insect, the Ghost-head Bee, inhabited the blood miasma, Qin Sang searched the area.  Much of Qin Sang's current success was due to the fat silkworm, the Tianmu butterfly, and the fire jade centipede—three spiritual insects—so he paid special attention to insects listed in the Strange Insect Catalogue.</p><p>Unfortunately, even the Blood-winged Ghost-head Bee was nowhere to be found, let alone the native variety.</p><p>His search yielding nothing, Qin Sang didn't linger and flew straight towards Wuyagu's inner valley. This time, he took the old path he had traveled with Yun Youzi.</p><p>Passing through the inner valley barrier, Qin Sang recalled discovering the trace of the Wuji Sect Master here with Yun Youzi, which triggered subsequent events.</p><p>Various memories surfaced.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled at his own pace, soon finding the ice field.  The ice crevice was still there.  Qin Sang entered the ice layer below, moving swiftly, and in a short while, an ice palace appeared before him.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang materialized in the ice palace, a dark figure lunged at him.</p><p>A wave of corpse-qi washed over him.</p><p>The attacker, green-faced and fanged, was a fearsome figure—Wushang transformed into a flying night rakshasa.  In his pursuit of the Dao, he had cultivated himself into a living corpse, searching for the Nightfall Lily here, only to suffer a corpse poison relapse, wandering aimlessly for countless years, unable to find peace.</p><p>Before Qin Sang made any move, Wushang was frozen in place, unable to stir.</p><p>"May you rest in peace and return to the cycle of reincarnation," Qin Sang said, bowing deeply and respectfully, thanking Wushang for guiding him on his path.  His expression solemn, he extended a finger, gently touching Wushang's brow.</p><p>Wushang's life force rapidly faded.  In the final moment, a hint of tranquility seemed to flicker in those lifeless eyes...</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Many things came up, and I returned late. One chapter today, I'll make up for it later.</p>
