<h1>Chapter 1785: Fusing the Seals</h1><p>Qin Sang's Dharma Idol was a Greené¸¾ (Qingluan).</p><p>In this realm, the enmity between humans and demons ran deep, irreconcilable as fire and water.  Qin Sang, wary of arousing suspicion, kept his Dharma Idol concealed.</p><p>Though unseen, the Qingluan Dharma Idol seemed to sense something, as if stirred from within.</p><p>Ever since the *Celestial Demon Refining Formula* reached the fifth level, the Qingluan Dharma Idol had gradually solidified from a mere phantom.</p><p>In the years following his breakthrough, Qin Sang had continuously sought to unravel the secrets of the Dharma Idol, yet his progress remained negligible, controlling the Qingluan's thunder power still a distant prospect.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at this very moment, the Qingluan Dharma Idol manifested an unforeseen power.</p><p>Each realm ascended by a Soul Formation cultivator represented a further step in their communion with the heavens. High-level cultivators, with their profound understanding of the Heavenly Might, could suppress opponents of lesser cultivation.</p><p>This could unsettle the weaker party, even shattering their spirit and will to resist.</p><p>The disparity in realms also manifested in the effectiveness of divine abilities and spells. The same spell, cast against a cultivator of higher realm, might be weakened by the suppression of Heavenly Might.</p><p>This ebb and flow amplified the difference in strength.</p><p>Due to this factor, despite possessing several potent divine abilities, Qin Sang felt less confident about challenging opponents beyond his realm after reaching Soul Formation.</p><p>However, this Wood Jiao, comparable to mid-stage Soul Formation, despite Qin Sang's inferior cultivation, didn't exert the same oppressive pressure as even the injured Thunder Turtle.</p><p>From Grandmaster Youhuang's previous actions, her caution in facing the Wood Jiao alone, employing various means to evade its frontal assaults, was evident.</p><p>Although this was part of their plan, it demonstrated that Grandmaster Youhuang was indeed suppressed by the Wood Jiao.</p><p>"The Qingluan Dharma Idol can withstand the oppressive Heavenly Might of opponents..."</p><p>Qin Sang deduced the reason, astonishment washing over him.</p><p>With the Dharma Idol's protection, he would no longer be hampered when facing opponents of higher realm, though the limits of its protection remained unknown.</p><p>Thoughts raced through his mind, yet Qin Sang's movements didn't falter, becoming even more composed.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The spirit spear descended from the heavens, unstoppable as it cleaved through the white flames, aimed squarely at the Wood Jiao's crown.</p><p>Black vortexes reflected in the Wood Jiao's ferocious eyes. The spear's gleaming tip, a painful prick to the Wood Jiao, caused its pupils to constrict sharply.</p><p>*Roar!*</p><p>A ferocious beast like the Wood Jiao, untamed and proud, roared in fury, revealing terrifying fangs. With a breath, it swallowed half of the white flames, then spewed them forth.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The white flames erupted into a pillar of fire, crashing head-on into the vortex.</p><p>Two formidable forces collided, shaking the heavens and earth. The black vortex was instantly torn apart.</p><p>The spirit spear, momentum unabated, spun rapidly, piercing through layers of white flames. Yet, just as it was about to strike the Wood Jiao, it faltered.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang closed in, silently channeling the Demon Subduing Seal, pressing it against the Wood Jiao's flank before unleashing its power.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Scales shattered and flew.</p><p>The Wood Jiao's flesh caved inward, its body arching in the air like a bow, a large patch of scales ripped away, blood and flesh exposed.</p><p>Struck by the heavy blow, the Wood Jiao plummeted, its tail thrashing wildly, carving deep gouges into the flanking mountains, sending dust and debris swirling skyward.</p><p>The Wood Jiao plunged into the sea of flames conjured by its own divine ability. Just as it seemed about to crash into the valley floor, a shrill cry echoed from the flames. It abruptly halted its descent, rebounding from the fiery sea.</p><p>Its ferocious eyes locked onto Qin Sang, brimming with rage.</p><p>Blood flowed freely from its wounds, yet seemingly unaffected, the flesh beneath its scales contracted, quickly staunching the bleeding. A bloody glow flickered, the wounds gradually healing.</p><p>"What a powerful physique! Such tough scales!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. The next instant, a gust of foul wind struck his face, a giant claw filling his vision.</p><p>Though a Jiao, the Wood Jiao possessed four claws, its sharp tips like swords. Qin Sang had no desire to experience their piercing embrace.</p><p>He instinctively recoiled, yet at the last moment, he changed his mind.</p><p>The Wood Jiao couldn't kill him, and his companions were nearby. Such a perfect opportunity for refinement was rare.</p><p>In a flash of thought, Qin Sang froze, as if paralyzed by fear. His blood surged, echoing like rumbling thunder.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Jiao's claw pierced his chest, yet only caught a phantom.</p><p>Qin Sang, footfalls like lotus blossoms, moved like a wraith, unscathed beneath the Jiao's claw. He didn't retreat, instead pressing forward, charging towards the Wood Jiao's chest and belly.</p><p>However, the Wood Jiao's battle instincts were sharper. Before Qin Sang could reach its vulnerable spot, another claw swiped at his head.</p><p>This claw, enveloped in white flames, like a giant fiery paw, seemed to warp the space around it, radiating a terrifying pressure. Enraged, the Wood Jiao aimed to crush this insect with a single blow.</p><p>Others, facing such pressure, would be immobilized, forced to retreat. But Qin Sang, shielded by the Dharma Idol, moved freely. He stepped into the air, passing through the gap between the claws, his left hand forming the Wheel Turning Seal.</p><p>The fiery claw, caught in the swirling force of the Wheel Turning Seal, momentarily stalled.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed coldly, his right palm striking with force.</p><p>Before the Wood Jiao could retract its other claw, the Demon Subduing Seal struck its joint squarely.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Scales shattered from the joint, the claw twisting at an unnatural angle, blood spraying into the air.</p><p>The Wood Jiao lurched, crashing into the scarred mountainside, the impact shaking the peak to its core.</p><p>In agony, the Wood Jiao roared furiously, its tail whipping back, lashing out at Qin Sang.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's expression changed. The Qingluan Dharma Idol's protection had failed. He was rooted to the spot, watching helplessly as the Jiao's tail hurtled towards him.</p><p>Clearly, this wasn't due to Heavenly Might but likely a natural immobilizing divine ability of the Wood Jiao.</p><p>The Jiao's tail brought with it a gale of foul wind. Even with numerous protective treasures, Qin Sang didn't want to endure this blow.</p><p>Just as he sought a means to escape, a black lightning bolt descended from the heavens. Grandmaster Guyun had finally arrived.</p><p>The spirit spear, having rebounded earlier, now rested in its master's hand.</p><p>Grandmaster Guyun twirled the spear, fearlessly charging towards the massive Wood Jiao.</p><p>Judging by his appearance alone, it was hard to believe this slender Daoist could be so ferocious in battle.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>Grandmaster Guyun's timing was impeccable. The spirit spear plunged directly into the base of the Wood Jiao's tail.</p><p>This was a weak point in the Wood Jiao's scales. The spear easily pierced through, pinning the Jiao's tail to the mountainside.</p><p>Driven to frenzy, the Wood Jiao, forgetting Qin Sang entirely, doubled back, its gaping maw snapping at Grandmaster Guyun.</p><p>Grandmaster Guyun didn't linger, retreating after the successful strike, withdrawing the spirit spear.</p><p>Blood gushed forth in an instant.</p><p>Then, an astonishing scene unfolded. The wound at the base of the Wood Jiao's tail closed at a visible rate. The tail, previously stiffened by the injury, quickly regained its flexibility.</p><p>Its other wounds followed suit.</p><p>"Such remarkable regenerative abilities..."</p><p>Grandmaster Guyun's eyes narrowed slightly, yet he showed no fear. If this was all the Wood Jiao had to offer, it wouldn't escape death today.</p><p>He even had the leisure to address Qin Sang, "Fellow Daoist, your courage and skill are admirable!"</p><p>He praised Qin Sang's audacity in engaging the Wood Jiao in close combat.</p><p>The Wood Jiao's every move carried the oppressive weight of Heavenly Might. A single misstep could be disastrous.  Grandmaster Guyun himself, even with assured victory, wouldn't take such a risk.</p><p>Only someone seasoned in battle, with unwavering confidence in their own abilities, would dare to do so.</p><p>Qin Sang, seemingly oblivious to Grandmaster Guyun's words, stared at his hands, lost in thought.</p><p>Just then, the Wood Jiao returned, and Grandmaster Guyun met its charge with his spirit spear.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, clenching his fists, charging forward once more, flanking the Wood Jiao alongside Grandmaster Guyun.</p><p>However, Qin Sang focused half his attention inward, specifically on two Buddhist seals:</p><p>The Demon Subduing Seal and the Wheel Turning Seal.</p><p>Throughout the battle, Qin Sang continuously employed both seals simultaneously, a contemplative expression on his face.</p><p>He revisited these mastered seals now because the battle with the Wood Jiao had sparked a new understanding of the *Seven Masters' Buddhist Seals*, inspiring him to attempt fusing the two.</p><p>During his recent physical breakthrough, Qin Sang had sensed this possibility, but at the time, his comprehension of the seventh seal, the Diamond Great Freedom Seal, was incomplete, leaving him unsure.</p><p>Confronting the Wood Jiao, amidst the ever-shifting battle, inspiration struck, confirming his suspicion. Mastering the seven seals was not the culmination of the *Seven Masters' Buddhist Seals*!</p><p>The seven seals could be fused.</p><p>While Qin Sang couldn't foresee the result of the fusion, he could make an educated guess.</p><p>As water had no constant form, when the *Seven Masters' Buddhist Seals* reached its pinnacle, adherence to specific seal forms would be unnecessary. Each strike would embody limitless change, its power unfathomable.</p><p>"The potential of the *Seven Masters' Buddhist Seals* surely extends beyond this!"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't anticipated that this secret art, purchased long ago, ignored at auction, would reveal such extraordinary depths today.</p><p>Eager to explore, Qin Sang used the Wood Jiao as a catalyst for his comprehension, starting by attempting to fuse the Demon Subduing Seal and the Wheel Turning Seal.</p><p>One firm, one yielding, complementing each other, their energies readily apparent, they seemed the most accessible path to understanding this fusion.</p><p>While Qin Sang and Grandmaster Guyun battled the Wood Jiao, Grandmaster Youhuang remained concealed at the valley floor, her work far from over.</p><p>The white flames, recalled by the Wood Jiao, now formed a protective fiery armor. Vines had silently crept across the valley floor, intertwining like giant pythons.</p><p>Grandmaster Youhuang's figure flickered, embedding talismans into the roots of the vines.</p><p>Empowered by the talismans, a faint glow swept across the vines, making them appear even more resilient.</p><p>Completing her preparations, Grandmaster Youhuang glanced upward, transmitting a message to her companions.</p><p>Qin Sang and Grandmaster Guyun exchanged glances, then both leaped above the Wood Jiao.</p><p>Grandmaster Guyun, gripping his spirit spear diagonally, transformed it into a whip, lashing the Wood Jiao fiercely.</p><p>Qin Sang repeated his previous tactic, evading the Wood Jiao's attack, striking its back with the Demon Subduing Seal.</p><p>The Wood Jiao was once again sent plummeting from the sky.</p><p>Simultaneously, the vines in the valley stirred to life, rising like true pythons, swaying in the air.</p><p>As the Wood Jiao fell, the vines shot towards it, swiftly enveloping it like a cocoon.</p><p>The Wood Jiao struggled violently.</p><p>Vines strained, snapping sounds echoing, yet many held fast, while more surged forward.</p><p>Trapped in this net, the Wood Jiao couldn't escape.</p><p>To make matters worse, Qin Sang and Grandmaster Guyun pursued relentlessly, striking at its vital points.</p><p>As more vines ensnared the Wood Jiao, Qin Sang and Grandmaster Guyun moved to flank its head, their hands like vices, gripping its neck and pressing down with force.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The Wood Jiao's head slammed into the ground, the earth trembling.</p><p>High above, a sword descended from beyond the heavens, like a rainbow of divine wrath, arriving in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the struggling beneath him abruptly weaken. He saw Grandmaster Zhijian's spirit sword pierce the Wood Jiao's crown, ending the beast's life with a single stroke.</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>Grandmaster Guyun laughed heartily.</p><p>Grandmaster Youhuang appeared, her eyes alight with satisfaction as she looked upon the Jiao's corpse.</p><p>Grandmaster Zhijian returned to the valley.</p><p>He had been tasked with guarding the perimeter, preventing their battle from attracting unwanted attention, and delivering the final blow.</p><p>Everything had gone even smoother than anticipated.</p><p>"Quickly divide the demonic corpse. We shouldn't linger," Grandmaster Zhijian instructed before proceeding to erase any trace of their presence.</p><p>They swiftly divided the spoils, keeping what was usable, burning the rest.</p><p>Grandmaster Youhuang received the demon core and essence blood.</p><p>Qin Sang and Grandmaster Guyun shared the Wood Jiao's azure scales, hoping to refine them into their Returning Wind Armor for further enhancement.</p><p>Grandmaster Zhijian received only a few segments of demon bone.</p><p>Grandmaster Youhuang had received the lion's share this time, but she would compensate them with Dao Court merit points.</p><p>With everything settled, the four quickly departed, their camaraderie strengthened by the battle.</p><p>"This beast was wandering alone, which is why the battle went so smoothly.  Don't become complacent. Deeper within the  Nie Yuan, if you can't swiftly conclude a hunt, you risk attracting another..."</p><p>Grandmaster Zhijian spoke gravely, directing his warning primarily at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared distracted, his mind preoccupied with the *Seven Masters' Buddhist Seals*.</p><p>They encountered no other Soul Formation level beasts along their path.</p><p>...</p><p>"We're less than a thousand li from our destination..."</p><p>Atop a mountain, Grandmaster Zhijian gazed northward.</p><p>Before he could finish, a rumbling echoed from ahead, plumes of smoke rising on the horizon.</p><p>"Another beast tide! Something significant must be happening up ahead!"</p><p>Grandmaster Zhijian frowned, turning back, "We'll need to rely on you two Fellow Daoists once more."</p><p>Grandmaster Guyun looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "I'll clear the path!"</p><p>With that, Qin Sang leaped down the mountain. Grandmaster Zhijian and Grandmaster Youhuang concealed their auras, following close behind, with Grandmaster Guyun bringing up the rear.</p><p>As they neared their destination, they needed to minimize their presence and avoid flying, lest they be discovered.</p><p>However, with the constant beast tides, avoiding them would delay their progress.  Thus, Qin Sang and Grandmaster Guyun, physical cultivators whose power resided within themselves, allowing them to control their aura during combat, cleared the path.</p><p>Grandmaster Zhijian flicked his finger, sending out a veil of light that concealed their forms. Qin Sang led the way, plunging into the beast horde.</p><p>The two Buddhist seals were deployed in turn, firm and yielding, complementing each other as Qin Sang continued to refine his understanding and adjust his technique.</p><p>Countless beasts brushed past them, their paths subtly diverted by unseen forces, or gently nudged aside. Everything seemed to occur naturally. Even the closest beasts remained oblivious, continuing their frantic charge.</p><p>Like water flowing through a stream, the four moved silently through the beast tide.</p><p>...</p><p>As the four rapidly approached their destination.</p><p>Northward.</p><p>Two figures stood in a mountain pass, gazing at the sky.</p><p>One stood ahead, clad in the celestial robes of a Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Censor of the Heavenly Hub Institute, hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>The other, half a step behind, was the dark-skinned stranger.</p><p>Both stared at the heavens, witnessing a spectacle beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals.</p><p>"This is the place this humble Daoist spoke of."</p><p>The Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Censor, seemingly recalling something, spoke with a hint of a sigh.</p><p>The dark-skinned stranger, his gaze fixed on the sky, remained silent for a long time, unable to look away.
