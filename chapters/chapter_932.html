<h1>Chapter 924: The Sword Wheel</h1><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>As the Blood Sword erupted, a low-pitched sword cry echoed from the opposite side.  The Fang youth's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>The next moment, a dazzling sword light burst forth. Qin Sang vanished, replaced by countless sword beams and sword energies forming a swirling Sword Wheel, like a full moon, blooming before the Fang youth's horrified gaze.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang had mastered the Sword Light Splitting technique.  However, limited by his cultivation, the number of sword beams he could manifest was restricted; most were actually disguised sword energies.</p><p>The ebony sword’s fragmented sword beams and illusory sword energies intertwined, forming a dazzling Sword Wheel, making it difficult to distinguish reality from illusion.  However, its momentum and power were undeniably real!</p><p>After mastering Sword Light Splitting, Qin Sang attempted to comprehend the next sword dao realm, "One Sword Out, Sword Array Born," but remained clueless.</p><p>According to the ancient texts he'd collected, grasping this realm required understanding the profound concept of 'momentum'—true sword momentum and intent—to gather countless sword beams and manifest a sword array out of thin air.</p><p>Although unable to grasp the essence, Qin Sang hadn't given up. Recalling the sword techniques learned in the Sword Path, he painstakingly devised a weaker version of the Sword Wheel, which had only recently taken shape.</p><p>Though far from a true sword array, it was a powerful technique for a Core Formation cultivator. During his spar with the Corpse Ghost Sect Core Formation cultivator in the Splitwind Islands, Qin Sang hadn't used the Sword Wheel. Otherwise, he could have easily defeated him.</p><p>Once he grasped the true meaning of sword momentum, its power would increase further.</p><p>With Qin Sang's full power, the sword beams surged like a celestial river, the Sword Wheel shining like a bright moon, dazzling and unstoppable.</p><p>Wherever it passed, everything seemed to crumble, its momentum awe-inspiring.</p><p>If someone witnessed this astonishing sight from afar, they might mistake it for a Nascent Soul Grandmaster’s attack, unaware that it was mostly for show.</p><p>The Fang youth knew the sword technique wasn't as terrifying as it appeared but admitted it was top-tier among Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>Now, he truly sensed danger.</p><p>‘Buzz…buzz…’</p><p>Insect-like chirping emanated from the Fang youth. Purple threads suddenly appeared within his insect armor, instantly filling it, making it look like it was forged from purple crystal.</p><p>The chirping intensified, and an intense purple light erupted, enveloping the Fang youth and rapidly transforming into a giant beetle.</p><p>The beetle glowed with purple light, its carapace studded with sharp spikes, its pincers as sharp as knives, and its appearance ferocious.</p><p>"The Purple Crystal Carapace…"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>He’d been guessing the Fang youth's natal insect, and now, seeing it manifest, he realized it was the Purple Crystal Carapace, ranked tenth on the Witch Insect List.</p><p>Spirit insects of this level were usually kept by Witch sects. As the chief disciple of Black Serpent Mountain, it wasn't surprising the Fang youth possessed such a natal insect.</p><p>The Purple Crystal Carapace’s shell was exceptionally hard.  Transformed into armor, it was renowned as the most defensive spirit insect on the Witch Insect List, only slightly weaker than those rare and wondrous insects.</p><p>More importantly, cultivating a Purple Crystal Carapace was far easier than those wondrous insects.</p><p>The Fang youth must have invested considerable effort into his Purple Crystal Carapace. It had already reached the late-stage third transformation.  Transformed into armor, early-stage Core Formation cultivators likely couldn't even pierce it, let alone injure the Fang youth.</p><p>No wonder he survived the "Commanding Thunder Technique" back then. Even though he had been prepared, the armor's contribution was undeniable.</p><p>After the Purple Crystal Carapace manifested, its pincers retracted, forming a purple barrier, firmly protecting the Fang youth.</p><p>Simultaneously, his true essence surged into the Blood Sword, the crimson sword energy intensifying, thickening like a giant pillar, its bloody light flooding the sky as it thrust towards the Sword Wheel.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A terrifying collision sent visible shockwaves in all directions. Beneath them, ancient trees, existing for who knew how long, were instantly pulverized.</p><p>At the center of the battle, the brilliant Sword Wheel, like a true giant wheel, shredded the crimson sword energy, breaking it inch by inch.</p><p>The next moment, the Sword Wheel shuddered violently, and the remaining sword beams poured forth.</p><p>The Purple Crystal Carapace's image was engulfed by the sword beams. Only the sound of a violent storm could be heard, but no screams from the Fang youth. Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  He followed the Sword Wheel, without hesitation, striking the insect's image with his palm.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A figure flew backward, stumbling, revealing the Fang youth.</p><p>He looked disheveled but mostly unharmed. Only the Purple Crystal Carapace’s image flickered, and a few faint scratches appeared on the armor itself.</p><p>His eyes were fierce, and he opened his mouth to speak, but a scream interrupted him.  He saw his junior brother being knocked away by Qin Sang’s avatar and then having an arm ripped off by the Twin-Headed Hound.</p><p>A mid-stage Core Formation cultivator, he was no match for the late-stage avatar and the Twin-Headed Hound, unable to even attempt escape.</p><p>“Senior Brother, save me!”</p><p>The older cultivator cried out in anguish.</p><p>The Fang youth's expression changed repeatedly. Gritting his teeth, he turned and fled.</p><p>He knew his junior brother couldn't last much longer. Once he died, he would face three powerful opponents. Qin Sang’s main body was already as strong as him.  If the fight continued, he would likely meet a grim end.</p><p>However, the Fang youth had barely moved a few yards when Qin Sang blocked his path.</p><p>His expression changed, and he shifted direction, only to be blocked again.</p><p>After several attempts, the Fang youth stopped, staring at Qin Sang, his face livid, his heart filled with shock.</p><p>Qin Sang's speed was terrifying.</p><p>While not excelling in movement techniques, as a peak Core Formation cultivator, he believed no cultivator of the same realm could stop him.  Now, he realized a Core Formation cultivator could possess such terrifying speed.</p><p>Unless he defeated Qin Sang, escape was impossible.</p><p>Indeed, after activating the Celestial Demon Transformation, Qin Sang’s speed was already among the best in his realm.  Combined with the Nine Dragons Celestial Chariot Talisman, even though he wasn’t as fast as a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, he wasn’t far behind, a speed the Fang youth couldn’t match.</p><p>Otherwise, given Qin Sang’s nature, he would have prepared the Commanding Thunder Technique in advance, hitting them with a devastating blow upon meeting.</p><p>His intent in engaging the Fang youth was to test his own strength. It seemed decades of arduous cultivation hadn't been in vain.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The other cultivator’s corpse, withered and dry, was tossed aside like a rag.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Hound blocked the remaining escape routes, supporting Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly, gripping his ebony sword, and charged again, the Sword Wheel reappearing.</p><p>Seeing this, the Fang youth understood a peaceful resolution was unlikely.</p><p>Surrender was out of the question. Only a desperate struggle remained.</p><p>The Fang youth roared towards the heavens.  His natal insect, moved by its master's emotions, wailed, its cry carrying a hint of sorrow.</p>
