<h1>Chapter 2110: Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles</h1><p>The man in white flew south directly out of the Western Lands, traversing the ocean's surface, his attention constantly fixed on what lay behind.  Though all seemed tranquil in his wake, a foreboding premonition intensified within his heart.</p><p>His instincts proved correct.  Before long, an unusual fluctuation rippled through his spiritual sense, a streak of escaping light rapidly closing in.</p><p>The man in white's expression shifted slightly, yet he betrayed no panic.  However, a moment later, a flicker of surprise flashed across his eyes.</p><p>Reputation, it seemed, fell short of reality. The escaping technique displayed by the pursuer was truly remarkable. He had initially thought Min Zhuo's description to be exaggerated, but now it appeared that Min Zhuo had perhaps even understated the truth.</p><p>Lost in thought, the man in white made no immediate move, maintaining his original speed. Soon, thunderous booms echoed from behind, and the sea below erupted in tumultuous waves.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, his figure halting mid-air. Turning to look back, he beheld a dazzling streak of lightning, as if piercing through the void itself, approaching with breathtaking speed.</p><p>The lightning illuminated the entire sea, and a resounding voice, overpowering even the thunder, rolled towards him.</p><p>"Since you've come to visit, why the hasty departure?"</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The voice reverberated across the ocean as the lightning abruptly ceased. From within, a Daoist in azure robes stepped forth, his gaze sharp and intense, fixed upon the eyes of the man in white. It was Qin Sang.</p><p>The man in white met Qin Sang's gaze without flinching. Their gazes, almost tangible, clashed in mid-air, stirring the sea below into a frenzy.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted. The man in white hadn't concealed his identity, or perhaps he hadn't needed to. The characteristics of the Si You Clan were too distinct. Their fighting style relied on companion beasts, and any engagement would inevitably reveal their origins.</p><p>"So fast!" Qin Sang's heart sank. He hadn't expected the Si You Clan to arrive so quickly.</p><p>The ritual altar was still incomplete. If the Si You Clan had already mobilized their forces, all his efforts would be wasted, a failure at the cusp of success. With the altar already mostly constructed, abandoning it now was unthinkable. He had to find a way to delay them, no matter the cost.</p><p>He scanned his surroundings. There were no other auras present, only this single individual, who appeared more like a scout. This brought him a slight measure of relief.</p><p>For a mere scout to possess the mid-stage Void Realm Second Layer cultivation, it was evident that the opposing force was formidable, not to be underestimated.</p><p>Faced with Qin Sang's questioning, the man in white remained composed, neither panicked nor flustered. He calmly retorted, "Are you the demonic guard by the side of that Si family remnant?"</p><p>The man's composure was unsettling. Was it a facade, or genuine confidence?</p><p>Qin Sang spoke coldly, "This Daoist doesn't know who you're referring to. You have stealthily infiltrated this Daoist's grounds. Shouldn't you provide an explanation?"</p><p>The man in white burst into laughter. "What use is denial? I advise you to cease courting death and hand over the Si family remnant immediately. Otherwise, you shall face utter annihilation!"</p><p>With his threat delivered, the man in white turned to leave. His figure flickered, splitting into three streaks of white light, each shooting towards a different direction.</p><p>Before the white lights could travel far, a clap of thunder resounded. Three streaks of azure lightning, even faster than the escaping lights, shot forth, striking the white lights with precision. Two of the lights flickered violently, exploding on the spot, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>A muffled groan emanated from the middle streak of white light.  A figure stumbled out, revealing the man in white, his appearance slightly disheveled. He glared fiercely ahead, where the azure lightning twisted slightly. Qin Sang, enveloped in crackling lightning, stepped forth.</p><p>"You were able to see through my Yuan Meng Illusory Body!"</p><p>The Yuan Meng Illusory Body was the companion beast's divine ability, used to deceive opponents, both in attack and retreat, and it had never failed him before.  His opponent hadn't hesitated for a moment, heading directly towards his true body, clearly indicating that his true location had been discerned. Yet, Qin Sang displayed no signs of using any Daoist arts, divine abilities, or spiritual treasures.</p><p>The more mysterious the opponent, the more formidable they seemed.  Caution bloomed in the man in white's heart.</p><p>Qin Sang disdained to answer.  No illusory technique could deceive the eyes of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The man in white and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly were at the same cultivation level.  Almost the instant his divine ability was deployed, the butterfly had pinpointed his true location, leaving him with nowhere to hide.</p><p>"Your words seem to carry an unfinished meaning. Why the rush to leave? Why not stay and clarify matters?"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was calm, yet his actions were swift and decisive.  He flipped his palm, summoning a spirit tablet.  The tablet instantly transformed into a mountain-like stele, plummeting towards the man in white's head.</p><p>As the forceful wind surged, the man in white continued his taunts, "You dare obstruct me with your true body? You have some nerve!"</p><p>Min Zhuo and the others hadn't returned empty-handed.  They had managed to gather some intelligence.  This demon had comprehended a Dharma Idol, yet it was his true body that had come, likely alerted by some anomaly with the altar and hastily pursuing.</p><p>In the man in white's view, this might be an opportunity.  If he could eliminate Qin Sang here, it would be equivalent to crippling Si Lu, a considerable achievement.</p><p>Of course, he was well aware that Qin Sang's true body wouldn't have pursued him without some assurance. This was his opponent's territory, and other experts might be converging.  Time was of the essence, the opportunity fleeting.</p><p>In a split second, the man in white made his decision. The orb on his forehead shimmered slightly, a wisp of white smoke rising and coalescing into a cloud above his head.</p><p>The smoke twisted and shifted, faintly forming the shape of a beast, finally solidifying into a gigantic white rhinoceros. Its hooves were thick and sturdy, its body as massive as a mountain, a sharp horn adorning its large head, no less imposing than the spirit tablet in Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>The white rhinoceros roared, its horn thrusting upwards with ferocity.  The sharp point pierced through the forceful wind, colliding heavily with the spirit tablet.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Two terrifying forces erupted, causing the heavens to tremble and the sea to rage.</p><p>The white rhinoceros held firm against the spirit tablet, but its hooves trembled, its neck twisting at an unnatural angle. Finally, it faltered, its roar becoming distorted.</p><p>The man in white's expression changed slightly. He hadn't expected his opponent, a whole realm below him, to possess such overwhelming power. This white rhinoceros was the most adept at close combat amongst his four companion beasts, yet it was still no match.</p><p>As the white rhinoceros retreated, the barrier before the man in white vanished. However, he had already anticipated this.  A pair of wings had materialized on his back, giving the illusion, to any onlooker, of two winged-race individuals locked in combat.</p><p>The man in white's wings were a dull grayish-black, far less dazzling than Qin Sang's phoenix wings. Yet, the speed they granted was astonishing. A series of black shadows trailed behind him as he retreated from the battlefield, escaping the immediate danger before the white rhinoceros was completely overwhelmed.</p><p>Simultaneously, the small snake within his sleeve flicked its tongue, stealthily releasing a drop of transparent venom.</p><p>As he retreated, the man in white pierced through a wave, subtly depositing the venom into the water, his actions undetectable. The wave crashed down, the venom spreading through the sea without any visible sign.</p><p>‘Crash! Crash! Crash!’</p><p>The waves roared.</p><p>The two figures faced each other across the turbulent sea.</p><p>The white rhinoceros, impervious to pain, shook its head and recovered, positioning itself before the man in white, charging towards Qin Sang once more.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>In an instant, the rhinoceros horn clashed with the spirit tablet several times, unleashing blinding flashes of spiritual light. The aftershocks churned the surrounding area into chaos.</p><p>The white rhinoceros fought fearlessly, devoted to protecting its master.</p><p>Empowered by his Dharma Idol and wielding the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, Qin Sang was a force to be reckoned with. The heavy spirit tablet moved with the agility of a needle in his hands. His attacks were formless, following his whims, yet incredibly precise.</p><p>Against an ordinary spiritual beast, he would have to account for its vital points, limiting his options. Though the white rhinoceros lacked such vulnerabilities, it was beginning to struggle.</p><p>Unfortunately, even if Qin Sang could suppress the white rhinoceros, it was futile if he couldn't harm the man in white directly.</p><p>While the rhinoceros and Qin Sang were entangled, the man in white utilized his wings to constantly shift his position, preventing Qin Sang from locking onto him.</p><p>His escaping technique wasn't as fast as Qin Sang's lightning escape, but it was remarkably agile. Coupled with the white rhinoceros's relentless interference, Qin Sang's repeated attempts to break through and attack the man in white directly were thwarted.</p><p>After several such exchanges, Qin Sang seemed to have reached an impasse, his options dwindling.</p><p>In contrast, the man in white grew increasingly composed.  Seizing an opening, he suddenly let out a sharp shriek.</p><p>The shriek was ear-splitting, causing Qin Sang's ears to throb slightly. The sound seemed to come from all directions.  Suddenly, his vision darkened. Four strange birds had appeared, encircling him.</p><p>These birds were upside down, their heads pointing downwards, their bodies above.  Their heads were pointed and slender, their wings extraordinarily large. The four birds spread their wings simultaneously, forming a screen around Qin Sang.</p><p>Their bodies were jet black, as if they had stepped out of an ink painting, closing in amidst the piercing shrieks.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, repelling the white rhinoceros.  With a flick of his wrist, the spirit tablet swept across all directions.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The first bird struck by the spirit tablet exploded, transforming into a mass of black liquid. The liquid dispersed into black raindrops, staining the seawater.</p><p>The other birds were undeterred by the first bird's gruesome fate. Their assault intensified.</p><p>As Qin Sang focused on dealing with the birds, the white rhinoceros, having recovered from the impact, charged again.  Its head lowered, its eyes glowing with an eerie blue light, it coordinated perfectly with the birds.  As it neared Qin Sang, its speed increased dramatically by almost fifty percent.</p><p>The attack was too sudden. The birds were keeping the spirit tablet occupied, leaving Qin Sang seemingly unable to react.</p><p>Just as the rhinoceros horn was about to pierce his chest, Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  He extended his left hand, gripping the horn.</p><p>A suit of armor materialized on his body – the Bright Mountain Armor.</p><p>An immense force surged from the rhinoceros horn, causing the Bright Mountain Armor to clang and its spiritual light to fluctuate violently.</p><p>But Qin Sang's grip remained firm, preventing the horn from advancing even an inch!</p><p>As a part-time body cultivator, Qin Sang's reliance wasn't on spiritual treasures, but on his powerful physical body, strengthened by his Dharma Idol and the Great Vajra Wheel Seal!</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>…</p><p>The white rhinoceros roared furiously, unable to break free from Qin Sang's grasp. A ferocious glint flashed in its eyes, and a blue light appeared at the tip of its horn.</p><p>The blue light resembled the pure sky after a rain, but Qin Sang's heart leaped with a strong premonition of danger.</p><p>Without hesitation, he channeled a sliver of Azure Phoenix True Lightning from his phoenix wings into his left hand.  The lightning and the blue light erupted simultaneously.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Both Qin Sang and the white rhinoceros were thrown back, a giant, swirling sphere of azure and blue light appearing between them.</p><p>The sphere expanded with astonishing speed, the azure and blue lights within seemingly devouring each other, violent fluctuations radiating outwards.</p><p>The void was filled with chaotic light and shadows, but the stalemate lasted only a moment.  The azure light gained the upper hand.</p><p>The power of the Azure Phoenix True Lightning was undeniable.  It overwhelmed its opponent, the azure light rapidly dominating within the sphere, transforming into a raging torrent, breaking through the blue light's blockade, threatening to engulf the white rhinoceros.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the rhinoceros didn't evade. It was swallowed by the azure light, countless arcs of lightning erupting from within and without, its body shattering into pieces.</p><p>However, the fragments of the rhinoceros didn't dissipate. Instead, they transformed into streams of water, suspending in mid-air, forming a dense net surrounding the battlefield.</p><p>"To force me to use Soul Obliteration, you can be proud!" The man in white's face was filled with arrogance.  The small snake in his sleeve emerged, no longer concealing itself, its head raised, hissing incessantly.</p><p>Now, the white rhinoceros, the strange birds, and the small snake, all three companion beasts were deployed.</p><p>The man in white's killing move, Soul Obliteration, was created by fusing the divine abilities of his three companion beasts. If struck by this attack, not only would one's physical body be instantly destroyed, but their soul would also be annihilated, hence the name Soul Obliteration!</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>The black seawater began to flow upwards.  The last remaining strange bird dissolved, the upper and lower streams of black water attempting to merge.</p><p>Simultaneously, a dense fog rose from the water net, rapidly engulfing the entire sea, swallowing Qin Sang within.</p><p>The black fog was strangely gentle, yet incredibly resilient, like cotton, perfectly suited to counter Qin Sang's physical strength.</p><p>The power of the man in white's meticulously prepared killing move wasn't limited to this.  The black fog rapidly converged towards the center.</p><p>If the person trapped within couldn't escape immediately, the consequences would be dire.  A smile just began to form on the man in white's face when his pupils suddenly constricted, his eyes reflecting a dazzling golden light.</p><p>From the heart of the black fog, a golden light erupted skyward, a golden sun rising majestically, melting the surrounding black fog like fire melting ice.</p><p>Beneath the golden sun, a figure bathed in golden light stood motionless in the void.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, his fingers lightly plucking the air as if strumming a zither. Several transparent water threads, previously invisible, trembled around him, revealing gaps.</p><p>Unhurried, he passed through the gaps, completely unharmed!</p><p>Qin Sang had used the Sun Wheel Seal, bolstered by the remaining power of the Azure Phoenix True Lightning, to break through the man in white's killing move.  However, it didn't mean he was safe. Danger still lurked.</p><p>The transparent water threads were a potent poison. If one unknowingly touched them, the consequences would be severe.  Fortunately, Qin Sang had once cultivated poison arts, alerting him to the danger. He had remained motionless within the black fog, and now he had completely neutralized the threat.</p><p>The man in white's expression froze momentarily.  He had known about Qin Sang's golden sun technique, so he wasn't overly surprised. A sneer then appeared on his face. "I underestimated you before!"</p><p>"Let's see how much you can withstand. Can you block the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles?"</p><p>The man in white roared, flicking his sleeve.  A golden light flew out, its radiance rivalling the Sun Wheel Seal above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>Within the golden light was a large golden lock with a ring!</p><p>The Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles soared into the air, like another golden sun, but even more brilliant, eclipsing the Sun Wheel Seal.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. The fluctuations from this treasure felt familiar, emanating an aura of extreme danger.</p><p>Golden light bathed the world, everything shimmering brilliantly.</p><p>'Click!'</p><p>The Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles trembled slightly, emitting a crisp sound, like the closing of a lock.</p><p>In the next instant, everything seemed to freeze, a deathly silence descending.</p><p>()</p>
