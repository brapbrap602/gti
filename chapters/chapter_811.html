<h1>Chapter 803: Heavenly Demon Manifestation</h1><p>The alchemist, despite being at the Core Formation stage, had a head of white hair and a wizened face.  His presence was striking and memorable. Seeing the attendant's respectful demeanor, it was clear the alchemist held a high position within the auction house.</p><p>"Senior, this is Alchemist Yi."</p><p>The attendant made the introduction, then tactfully closed the door and withdrew.</p><p>"Alchemist Yi…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, a look of surprise on his face. He immediately rose and greeted him warmly, "I didn't expect to trouble Alchemist Yi.  I'm truly honored!"</p><p>He had previously learned that Alchemist Yi was one of the most renowned alchemists at the Xiang'an Auction House. Seeing him, Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder if the spirit fruit was something truly rare to have warranted such attention. However, he kept his expression neutral.</p><p>The two exchanged pleasantries and sat down.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, may I examine the jade slip?"</p><p>Alchemist Yi pointed to the jade slip and asked. Receiving Qin Sang's permission, he focused his attention on its contents.</p><p>After a while, Alchemist Yi opened his eyes. Noticing Qin Sang's curious gaze, he smiled faintly and said, "The attendant described the spirit fruit you seek. Its characteristics are quite peculiar. It's a spirit fruit I've never encountered before, so I offered to take a look."</p><p>Qin Sang asked eagerly, "Fellow Daoist Yi, do you have any leads?"</p><p>Alchemist Yi frowned in thought for a moment, then asked in return, "Fellow Daoist Qin, do you only have these two images?  Do you truly have no other information?"</p><p>Qin Sang remained firm on this point.</p><p>Alchemist Yi said, "Frankly, these images stir a faint memory.  I may have seen it somewhere before, but it was so long ago that I can't quite recall.  It's possible this spirit fruit was depicted in ancient demonic texts I studied during my alchemy training. Perhaps you could return in a while. I'll thoroughly investigate this matter."</p><p>"Demonic?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>Even a renowned human alchemist didn't recognize it and needed to consult demonic texts. Could it be that this spirit fruit was only suitable for demonic beasts? If so, he would have to give them all to his Two-Headed Vulture, rendering his efforts pointless.</p><p>"Then I'll trouble Fellow Daoist Yi. This small token is a mere gesture of my appreciation."</p><p>Qin Sang took out a small pouch of spirit stones as a reward.</p><p>Alchemist Yi accepted them without hesitation.</p><p>The two continued their conversation amiably.  Qin Sang seized the opportunity to express his interest in learning the demonic language and requested Alchemist Yi's guidance.</p><p>"I consider myself somewhat accomplished in the art of refining. I've heard that Skyrise City possesses ancient demonic texts plundered from the Demonic Sea, some of which pertain to refining.  These texts differ greatly from human methods, yet they contain valuable insights. Unfortunately, my knowledge is limited, and I struggle to comprehend the deeper meanings. It's like navigating through a fog.  I've been hoping to find a skilled master to enlighten me…"</p><p>He sensed from Alchemist Yi's words that he was well-versed in the demonic language, so he decided to seek his tutelage.  As a human, cultivating demonic techniques was risky before fully comprehending the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*.</p><p>Hearing this, and learning that Qin Sang was a rogue cultivator, Alchemist Yi regarded him with newfound respect. "Fellow Daoist, at such a young age, you not only possess such high cultivation but also practice refining. I'm truly impressed!  There's no need to mention apprenticeship. I enjoy making friends.  The demonic language is nothing more than a skill, not some precious treasure. Take this jade slip. It contains not only my insights but also the collective understanding of our auction house colleagues regarding the demonic language. If you master its contents, you'll be able to understand those ancient texts."</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed and offered payment, but Alchemist Yi refused.</p><p>"I offer this to foster goodwill and build a connection with a promising fellow daoist like yourself. To be honest, every member of our auction house has a copy of this jade slip. It's not a great secret."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang accepted the jade slip without further ado. In return, he purchased a large quantity of spirit materials and consigned some demon cores and other items for auction.</p><p>These spirit materials were primarily for constructing spirit arrays and refining the poles of the Ten Yama Banners.  The spirit array was complex and required numerous materials.</p><p>The Xiang'an Auction House was wealthy and resourceful. The attendant, upon receiving the order, quickly returned with a storage pouch, having gathered seventy to eighty percent of the required materials and promising to assist in finding the rest.</p><p>Money makes the world go round.</p><p>His lavish spending earned him even greater enthusiasm from the auction house.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang inquired about purchasing high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>This presented a challenge for Alchemist Yi. "Fellow Daoist, you should be aware that high-grade and top-grade spirit stones have special applications. For instance, the protective arrays of major sects require high-grade spirit stones to function. They cannot be viewed solely in terms of their monetary value.  In recent years, the number of high-grade spirit stones mined has decreased, and they are largely controlled by powerful forces, rarely falling into private hands.  Our two races have only managed to establish a foothold in the Demonic Sea and lack the capacity to extensively search for spirit stone mines. Consequently, high-grade spirit stones have become increasingly scarce, and their value has soared.  You'll have to wait for an opportunity. If someone is willing to sell, we'll contact you."</p><p>Qin Sang understood this. High-grade spirit stones were treated as strategic resources by major powers, and the Xiang'an Auction House, backed by the three major merchant alliances, was no exception.</p><p>The more turbulent the Canglang Sea became, the more sought-after high-grade spirit stones would be. However, he only needed a few, so it shouldn't be too difficult.</p><p>Close to midnight, Qin Sang finally emerged from the auction house, laden with treasures but having spent a considerable sum.</p><p>After leaving the auction house, Qin Sang didn't linger, eager to return and study the demonic language.</p><p>Back in his cave dwelling, Qin Sang activated the protective array, took out the jade slip, and shut himself off from the outside world.</p><p>The contents of the jade slip were far more detailed than anything he had learned before, providing an in-depth explanation of the demonic language.  It was clearly the result of meticulous research by the experts at the auction house.  With the jade slip as his guide, Qin Sang devoted himself to comprehending the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*.</p><p>With the guidance of the jade slip, he finally fully grasped the cultivation method.</p><p>The first half of the method was divided into four levels, with the latter half shrouded in a mystical fog. Qin Sang now understood that his insufficient cultivation level prevented him from seeing beyond the fog.</p><p>He focused on the body refinement aspect.</p><p>The method claimed that it would ultimately cultivate a Heavenly Demon Body, signifying that body refinement was its core.</p><p>In the first four levels, daily cultivation involved drawing upon the power of the celestial stars to gradually temper the physique.  Each breakthrough, however, required undergoing a process called Star Essence Infusion.</p><p>Star Essence Infusion involved drawing upon an immensely dense concentration of celestial star power for instantaneous empowerment to achieve a breakthrough. This process inevitably carried risks.</p><p>There was a reason why the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* was considered a top-tier cultivation method.</p><p>Upon mastering the first three levels, one could cultivate a divine ability called Heavenly Demon Transformation, which greatly enhanced combat prowess. The method lacked a detailed description of its effects; only through practice could one truly understand its power.</p><p>Upon successfully breaking through to the fourth level, one could unlock the Heavenly Demon Manifestation. This was said to be the true entry point of the method.  The Heavenly Demon Manifestation granted access to a portion of the Heavenly Demon's divine abilities!</p><p>Legend had it that Heavenly Demons rivaled Grand Completion cultivators, standing just a step away from ascension.</p><p>Even a fraction of a Heavenly Demon's divine abilities would be terrifying. Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder if the method exaggerated the effects of the Heavenly Demon Manifestation.</p>
