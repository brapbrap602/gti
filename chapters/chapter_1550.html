<h1></h1><p>Venerable Chengyuan's cultivation was already at the peak of Mid Nascent Soul, merely a step away from Late Nascent Soul.</p><p>At this moment, he astonishingly possessed power comparable to a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>This secret technique was actually a mutually destructive method.  Once the duration of the secret technique ended, Venerable Chengyuan would have to meditate in seclusion for several decades to replenish his depleted essence.</p><p>But he still employed this technique without hesitation.</p><p>The opposing side had two cultivators of the same rank.</p><p>Reinforcements couldn't arrive in time.</p><p>The main function of the temple's protective spiritual formation was to defend against external enemies. Since the enemy had already succeeded, they would definitely focus on escaping, and the restrictive power of the spiritual formation would be greatly reduced.</p><p>The śarīra relic was formed from Patriarch Hongyi's failed breakthrough, making it easy to infer its purpose.</p><p>Trapped at the Late Nascent Soul bottleneck for many years, Venerable Chengyuan had been unable to glimpse the path forward. The śarīra relic's significance to him was self-evident; it could not be lost.</p><p>Even at a tremendous cost, he would spare no effort!</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan was an enlightened monk.  Sitting in meditation for decades in the Chan hall was commonplace.  His unwavering resolve was among the best in the world, with few external things able to disturb his thoughts.</p><p>Now, however, Venerable Chengyuan's face was filled with killing intent, his eyes sharp as blades.</p><p>The śarīra relic was a matter of contention on the path to the Great Dao.</p><p>If missed, he might be forever stuck at this stage for the rest of his life.</p><p>When a cultivator encountered such an opportunity, they would undoubtedly fight with all their might, risking everything!</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his attention from the śarīra relic to Venerable Chengyuan. Sensing the change in Chengyuan's aura, his gaze deepened slightly, knowing he had encountered a formidable opponent.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>With a rapid flap of his phoenix wings, Qin Sang moved with effortless grace, transforming into a streak of lightning, escaping from the Pagoda Forest and fleeing towards the temple's exterior in an instant.</p><p>Though his escape speed was fast, it was not as swift as Venerable Chengyuan's translocation within the spiritual formation.</p><p>Just as he crossed the vast bamboo forest behind Zhulan Temple, Qin Sang saw the void ahead ripple.  Venerable Chengyuan's figure appeared out of thin air, blocking his path as if by instantaneous travel.</p><p>Before Venerable Chengyuan's form fully materialized, a blade’s radiance suddenly burst forth.</p><p>The blade aura originated from Venerable Chengyuan's heart.</p><p>The blade was only four fingers long, shaped like a bird's feather, and as thin as gauze.</p><p>This was the Precept Blade!</p><p>It was also Venerable Chengyuan's natal magic treasure.</p><p>The Precept Blade.</p><p>The blade of precepts and discipline.</p><p>In Venerable Chengyuan's hands, however, it was an undeniable instrument of slaughter.</p><p>Since entering meditative stillness on the cliff face, Venerable Chengyuan's hands had long been free from bloodshed.  The Precept Blade remained sheathed, like a caged tiger.  Yet, its killing nature remained undiminished.  All of Venerable Chengyuan's killing intent had fused into the blade's intent, nurtured over many years.</p><p>Once unsheathed, its light split the sun.</p><p>Killing intent filled the air, a mournful wind swept through the path!</p><p>Qin Sang's vision was completely dominated by this Precept Blade. The sun seemed to be cleaved in two.</p><p>It was already late autumn.</p><p>Influenced by the blade’s intent, the surroundings became even colder, as if plunged into the depths of winter.</p><p>"Not a pseudo-spiritual treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes slightly, his expression calm.</p><p>Sensing the aura of the Precept Blade, he judged it to be a top-grade magic treasure.</p><p>He wasn't sure if it was a special advantage of Buddhist cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang had noticed that many Buddhist cultivators in the Western Desert possessed stronger divine senses than cultivators of the same rank.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Venerable Chengyuan's divine sense had reached the Nascent Form realm, allowing him to cultivate the "Ritual Offering Technique."  However, the Precept Blade's power remained within the realm of magic treasures.</p><p>This indicated that secret techniques like the "Ritual Offering Technique," used for nurturing pseudo-spiritual treasures, were not common even in the Central Continent, and certainly not widely known in the Western Desert.</p><p>After his last encounter with the Eight Sceneries cultivator, Qin Sang assumed that, apart from the Sun God Tree, his other magic treasures wouldn't hold much of an advantage in the Central Continent.  Therefore, he estimated Venerable Chengyuan's strength as high as possible and refrained from acting rashly.</p><p>Of course, it was also possible that Venerable Chengyuan was focused on his breakthrough and unwilling to be distracted by external objects, as cultivating the "Ritual Offering Technique" required significant mental effort.</p><p>For a cultivator, realm was paramount.  It was better to spend that time searching for opportunities for breakthroughs.</p><p>In any case, without a pseudo-spiritual treasure, even if Venerable Chengyuan was a true Grand Cultivator, Qin Sang wouldn't fear him, let alone one whose power was forcibly elevated.</p><p>"Good blade technique!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, the demonic banner before him fluttering in the wind.</p><p>The blade aura shot towards him, Qin Sang locked onto by the Precept Blade.</p><p>Although it was only a top-grade magic treasure, Venerable Chengyuan had nurtured its blade intent for an unknown number of years. The Precept Blade's first unsheathing possessed extraordinary power, not to be underestimated.</p><p>If it were any other Mid Nascent Soul cultivator, a moment of carelessness could result in their physical body being cleaved in two.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sharp pain between his eyebrows, a sensation of being split in half.</p><p>His expression remained unfazed.  His escaping light came to an abrupt halt, and Demonic Fire flew from his hand!</p><p>The black Demonic Fire transformed into a black cloud. Wherever the flames spread, rocks and bamboo forests turned to ash. The Demonic Fire suddenly contracted inwards, forming a fire dragon that soared into the sky, charging straight towards the Precept Blade!</p><p>Having spent decades cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" during his travels through the Windstorm Belt, Qin Sang's divine sense had greatly increased.  The Golden Lotus refined more Demonic Fire, naturally increasing the amount and power of Demonic Fire he could control through the Golden Lotus.</p><p>Sensing the might of the Demonic Fire dragon, Venerable Chengyuan's heart trembled.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The blade aura sliced into the Demonic Fire dragon, piercing straight from its head to its abdomen.</p><p>The thin Precept Blade was incomparably sharp.</p><p>The upper half of the Demonic Fire dragon was severed, its tail still connected, turning it into a two-headed black python.</p><p>However, after cleaving the Demonic Fire, the blade intent was mostly dissipated.  Qin Sang flapped his wings, simultaneously forming the Lotus Heart Seal, dodging to the side.</p><p>"Pseudo-spiritual treasure!"</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan exclaimed softly, his fingers moving like a wheel, rapidly forming a hand seal.</p><p>Instantly, the mountaintop was engulfed in swirling winds and clouds.</p><p>The temple's protective spiritual formation descended, showering the area with countless golden rays of light.</p><p>As the saying went, speed was essential in war.</p><p>If the Zhulan Temple monks could form a formation in time and manipulate the protective spiritual formation together to reinforce Venerable Chengyuan, the pressure on Qin Sang would greatly increase.</p><p>However, from the moment Qin Sang and Liu Li made their move, it had only been an instant. The Zhulan Temple monks were still scattered throughout the temple, each going about their own business.  Even if well-trained, they couldn't match the speed of Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The disciples responsible for guarding the spiritual formation could only maintain its basic defensive capabilities, forming a golden barrier over Zhulan Temple.  The speed at which they could change the formation was far too slow to keep up with the battle.</p><p>Aware of the critical situation, all the monks, their faces filled with fury, rushed towards the back mountain.</p><p>For the time being, Venerable Chengyuan had to divide his attention, personally controlling the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced upward.  His eyes met with dazzling golden light, a rain of golden light descending like needles on his back. He hastily urged the Wishfulfilling Jewel within his body, activating a protective罡罩.</p><p>Simultaneously, his hand seals changed, the Demonic Fire rising into the air and transforming into a black cloud, shielding him from above.</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The golden rays of light rained down like arrows, covering the sky.</p><p>Flames danced within the black cloud, showing signs of dispersing.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan, relentless, trembled his Precept Blade, preparing to strike again, when he suddenly heard two strange sounds, 'Heng! Ha!'  His Nascent Soul was shaken.</p><p>"Trivial tricks!"</p><p>A flush of blood rushed to Venerable Chengyuan's withered, yellow face. He roared in anger, the sound of a bell echoing from within him.  A bell's shadow flickered around him, albeit much smaller than before, covering only his head, shaking constantly.</p><p>He knew Qin Sang's divine sense was powerful, a formidable opponent rarely seen in his lifetime.  Naturally, he had to guard against such divine abilities that attacked the Nascent Soul.</p><p>This bronze bell was a defensive treasure. Not only could it protect the body, but its sound also possessed special power, capable of shielding the Nascent Soul.</p><p>The bell's sound dispelled the Heng Ha sounds, greatly weakening the power of the Soul-Seizing Mantra. Moreover, Venerable Chengyuan's divine sense was already powerful, so the damage he suffered was negligible.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't hoped to severely injure Venerable Chengyuan with the Soul-Seizing Mantra.</p><p>His goal was to create an opportunity for Liu Li!</p><p>While Venerable Chengyuan's Nascent Soul was under attack, Liu Li had already arrived, repeating her previous tactic.  The Ice Soul Divine Light silently spread beneath Venerable Chengyuan, erupting suddenly.</p><p>Unfortunately, their opponent was also a seasoned, top-tier expert, and the same trick was difficult to pull off twice.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan had anticipated Liu Li's movements. Breaking free from the Soul-Seizing Mantra, he immediately translocated, the Ice Soul Divine Light striking empty air.</p><p>A glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>His years of studying Zhulan Temple's protective spiritual formation hadn't been wasted.</p><p>Using his Heavenly Eye divine ability, he sensed the changes in the spiritual formation's energy flow, allowing him to judge the approximate area where Venerable Chengyuan had translocated.  He immediately directed the Demonic Fire, changing its direction, towards a seemingly empty patch of void.</p><p>The opportunity was fleeting. Such judgments were prone to errors, and with the Demonic Fire dispersed, its power was somewhat diminished.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan reappeared at the edge of the Demonic Fire's reach.  The Precept Blade rapidly sliced dozens of times, each blade aura blooming like a lotus, repelling the approaching Demonic Fire.</p><p>Simultaneously, Venerable Chengyuan chanted a Buddhist mantra, forming the Single-Hand Earth-Touching Seal. A golden ring abruptly rose from the ground.</p><p>The golden ring appeared directly beneath Qin Sang.</p><p>This was Venerable Chengyuan's only plan to retain the śarīra relic after witnessing Qin Sang's strength.  He secretly channeled most of the protective spiritual formation's power to this point, setting a trap.</p><p>Once entangled by the golden ring, Qin Sang would be trapped.  Escaping would require considerable effort. By then, reinforcements would have arrived, and the combined strength of the various temples' experts would trap the two thieves within Zhulan Temple, like fish in a barrel.</p><p>The golden ring rose into the air, swift as lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to have run out of options, his brow furrowed deeply.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan slightly tilted the Precept Blade, aiming it at Liu Li to prevent the Daoist nun from rescuing Qin Sang, while simultaneously focusing on activating the spiritual formation to imprison Qin Sang.</p><p>At this moment, a chilling light suddenly erupted from where Liu Li stood.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan caught a glimpse of a strangely shaped small seal from the corner of his eye, his heart sinking.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The cold sun hung high, the Horned Serpent revived.</p><p>Its roar reverberated through the oasis.  The common folk, who had been devoutly prostrating, looked up at the sky in terror.  They saw a terrifying monster appear in the heavens, clawing and tearing through the golden glow, ferocious and menacing.</p><p>The Buddha within the golden glow vanished, seemingly swallowed whole by the monster.</p><p>Everyone wept, wailing in anguish.</p><p>The Four-Carriage Horned Serpent Seal, given to Liu Li, had recognized her as its master after years of refinement.</p><p>Liu Li's cultivation was inferior to Tong Lingyu's, but in her hands, the spiritual treasure seemed even more powerful, and Liu Li didn't appear to be straining herself.</p><p>This was the greatest difference between a spiritual treasure recognizing its master and the "Treasure Mastery Art."</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Horned Serpent swooped down.</p><p>"A true spiritual treasure!"</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan could no longer maintain his composure, his mind shaken, he cried out in disbelief.</p><p>True spiritual treasures were exceedingly rare, even in the Central Continent.</p><p>This was because refining spiritual treasures was extremely difficult. Even if someone painstakingly refined their natal magic treasure to the level of a spiritual treasure, upon their death, the spiritual treasure's sentience would dissipate, reverting back to a magic treasure, unable to be passed down.</p><p>From where did these two harbingers of disaster hail?</p><p>One wielded mystical divine abilities and commanded a spiritual treasure.</p><p>The other possessed escape techniques and divine sense no weaker than a Grand Cultivator, wielding a pseudo-spiritual treasure.</p><p>Such individuals were rare even among the top sects of the Central Plains.  When had the cultivation world produced these two apex experts?</p><p>The Horned Serpent was ferocious, its chilling flames washing over everything.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan no longer cared about Qin Sang, quickly translocating to avoid its edge.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Horned Serpent abruptly changed direction. It didn't go to rescue Qin Sang, but instead joined forces with the Demonic Fire.  Under countless shocked gazes, they charged towards the barrier shrouding the sky above.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Golden light erupted skyward.</p><p>The mountains seemed to tremble.</p><p>The great lake of the oasis surged with unprecedentedly monstrous waves.</p><p>Chilling flames and Demonic Fire spread across the sky, a boundless torrent of flames indistinguishable from one another.</p><p>The monks controlling the spiritual formation were still following Venerable Chengyuan's will, focused on manipulating the golden ring to imprison Qin Sang.  They couldn't react in time.</p><p>They could only watch helplessly as a crack appeared in the protective spiritual formation, torn open from within.</p><p>Simultaneously, the golden ring dispersed due to the vibrations in the spiritual formation, revealing a flaw.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity to escape.</p><p>Suddenly, a shout came from outside the temple.</p><p>"Senior Brother Chengyuan, Kongyu has come to assist you!"</p><p>The voice rolled in, drawing closer.</p><p>Venerable Kongyu.</p><p>A high monk from Luoluo Temple, one of the Seven Stars of the Vast Sea, a Mid Nascent Soul expert.</p><p>The name Luoluo Temple was somewhat peculiar, derived from a unique spiritual tree in the Vast Sea, the Luoluo Tree.</p><p>Zhulan Temple was located in the eastern part of this oasis, with Luoluo Temple to its east, adjacent to Zhulan Temple, the closest of the six great temples.</p><p>As expected, Venerable Kongyu was the first to arrive.</p><p>The voice, amplified by true essence, boomed like thunder.</p><p>The next moment, an old monk clad in kasaya appeared above Zhulan Temple.</p><p>Venerable Kongyu held a purple-gold alms bowl in his left hand, his gaze sharp as lightning. He immediately noticed the crack in the barrier and, with a flick of his wrist, prepared to use the alms bowl to seal the fissure.</p><p>Suddenly, a gust of wind shot from the side, the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>From beginning to end, Qin Sang's avatar had remained outside the temple, partly to intercept reinforcements and prevent their swift arrival, partly to be ready to coordinate from within and without, assisting in breaking the formation.</p><p>The treasure snatching had proceeded more smoothly than expected.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't even used the Sun God Tree yet.</p><p>And there was another one outside!</p><p>The Zhulan Temple monks, having just seen hope in Venerable Kongyu's arrival, were once again plunged into despair.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan could only laugh in fury.</p><p>Three Mid Nascent Soul experts were making a fuss over little Zhulan Temple.  He truly didn't know whether to be enraged or feel honored.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Sword energy approached.</p><p>Venerable Kongyu, not expecting another powerful enemy lurking outside the temple, was startled. He quickly turned the alms bowl, its opening facing the sword energy, emitting purple-gold mystical light.</p><p>With a 'Dong!' the sword light was swallowed by the purple-gold mystical light.  The Golden Sinking Sword's momentum was checked, and Venerable Kongyu's figure trembled, shifting several hundred zhang.</p><p>Although unharmed, he was now unable to stop the enemies within Zhulan Temple.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Two figures flashed out from the crack.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the oasis.</p><p>In the vast sandy sea.</p><p>A few Bodhi trees stood alone amidst the yellow sand, providing a bit of shade for passing monks.</p><p>At this moment, a person sat cross-legged beneath the Bodhi trees.</p><p>This person wore a bamboo hat, concealing their face, yet was dressed in celestial robes and adorned with璎珞, like a Bodhisattva incarnate.  It was none other than the renowned Moonlight Bodhisattva.</p><p>Monks surrounded them.</p><p>Seeing the Moonlight Bodhisattva's audacious attire, the younger monks' eyes burned with anger.</p><p>Venerables Chengzhen and Guanhui, however, remained unfazed, spitting as they argued over scriptures.</p><p>At the height of their debate.</p><p>Venerable Chengzhen suddenly stopped speaking, looking down in surprise.  The jade pendant at his waist clattered, splitting in two.  The monks, hearing the sound, changed color, falling silent.</p><p>Something had happened at the temple!</p><p>"What's this?  Are you venerable monks admitting defeat already? Then leave behind all the scriptures from your temple's Scripture Repository."</p><p>Unaware of the situation, the Moonlight Bodhisattva chuckled softly, their voice ethereal.</p>
