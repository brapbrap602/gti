<h1>Chapter 487: Unexpected Emergency</h1><p>As wisps of earth-煞 energy bombarded the demon pill, its color slowly changed, with nearly half now stained black.  The demon pill at this moment was extremely strange, neither fully demon nor fully煞.</p><p>Everything seemed calm. If this stability continued, once the demon pill turned completely black, the煞 energy infusion would be complete, and the flying night yaksha would be successfully refined.</p><p>Alas, things rarely go as planned.  Qin Sang, never relaxing, poured all his energy into observing every minute change in the demon pill. Yet, this sudden turn of events caught him completely off guard.</p><p>Without warning, the demonic energy within the pill erupted violently. Before Qin Sang could withdraw the煞 energy, it reached its peak in an instant, colliding explosively with the earth-煞 energy!</p><p>Caught unprepared, Qin Sang frantically channeled his spiritual energy, instructing Yu Hua in an attempt to mitigate the situation.  However, his efforts proved futile; he couldn't stop the process. Soon, he felt a tearing within the demon pill—it was about to explode.</p><p>In an instant, the situation spiraled out of control. Qin Sang's heart plummeted, his body growing icy cold.</p><p>Reason told him to abandon the process and flee immediately.  He couldn't prevent the demon pill's explosion.  If he left before it detonated, he might escape the epicenter and avoid serious injury.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that even among Tian Shi Sect disciples, only a select few dared to refine a flying night yaksha at the Foundation Establishment stage, and even fewer attempted it without the help of teachers or friends.</p><p>But how could Qin Sang give up?</p><p>He had invested countless efforts into this flying night yaksha—the Tian Shi talisman, the false-core living corpse, the demon pill—each incredibly precious.  More importantly, failure would severely impact his future plans.</p><p>Without the flying night yaksha, he could only rely on two artifacts with limited power and a single, short-range Xu Tian Thunder.  He knew how formidable Golden Core cultivators were, and even if Daoist Jiu Pao was still recovering from his injuries, these items might not be enough.  He refused to accept defeat!</p><p>Artifacts!</p><p>Facing the increasingly violent demon pill, Qin Sang remained still.  Suddenly, his brow flashed, and the ebony sword shot out, flying directly into Yu Hua's energy sea without pausing.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this scenario, and his only recourse was to use the ebony sword.  A magical artifact comparable to the demon pill in rank, its effectiveness remained uncertain. But he had to try.</p><p>Within Yu Hua's energy sea, the ebony sword silently positioned itself above the demon pill.  The storm around the pill was already spreading outwards, yet the sword easily pierced the heart of the storm and targeted the demon pill.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sword energy exploded, the artifact's power undeniable.  The fierce sword energy cut through the storm and struck the demon pill directly!</p><p>The storm around the demon pill momentarily paused.</p><p>Success!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up with joy.  Seizing this hard-won opportunity, he quickly separated the two forces, and the storm gradually subsided.  He left the ebony sword suspended in Yu Hua's energy sea, continuing the煞 energy infusion.</p><p>Perhaps the ebony sword had truly helped, as the remaining steps proceeded unexpectedly smoothly, with only minor setbacks.  The煞 pill was successfully refined.</p><p>Yu Hua's煞 energy did indeed run dry halfway through. Luckily, Qin Sang had chosen the Earth-Sinking Cave for the refinement, allowing for timely replenishment and preventing irreparable damage.</p><p>The once exquisite demon pill was now pitch-black, a sight to behold.  The煞 pill slowly rotated within Yu Hua, releasing waves of煞 energy. This energy overwhelmed Yu Hua's internal restrictions, surging through his meridians, even affecting his primordial spirit.</p><p>This refined his body, but also made his corpse-like features more pronounced.  While Yu Hua's changes were subtle as a living corpse, especially with the *Dun Ling Jue* concealing his corpse energy (making him look like a normal person to a casual observer), his skin, including his face, had turned bluish-black, similar to Wu Shang from the Wuyagu ice cave.  This was a minor issue.</p><p>Qin Sang, nearly exhausted, sat down heavily, his face alight with joy as he looked at Yu Hua.</p><p>Flying Night Rakshasa!</p><p>Flying Night Rakshasa!</p><p>Finally perfected!</p><p>With the Flying Night Rakshasa assisting me, becoming invincible at the Foundation Establishment stage is no longer a pipe dream.</p><p>After a brief rest, Qin Sang eagerly summoned the Flying Night Rakshasa to check its煞丹 (shadan). The shadan had fully merged with Yu Hua and begun transforming into a corpse煞丹.</p><p>As he expected, his soul imprint remained incredibly stable.  Yu Hua, having transformed into the Flying Night Rakshasa, remained docile and obedient.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang withdrew his spiritual sense, carefully examining the Flying Night Rakshasa. Its transformations perfectly matched Wu Shang's records.</p><p>During the creation of the Flying Night Rakshasa, Qin Sang gained a deeper understanding of Wu Shang's "Condensing煞 and Refining Gang Qi" secret technique.</p><p>Perhaps Wu Shang's technique does have some feasibility.</p><p>If half of the earth煞 energy were replaced with Heavenly Gang Qi...</p><p>Both being extraordinary substances born from the Heaven and Earth's spiritual energy, perhaps they could truly harmonize the earth煞 energy. This would prevent the earth煞 energy from impacting areas outside the shadan.</p><p>It would avoid the instantaneous corpse transformation suffered by Yu Hua, making it irreversible.</p><p>This way, the only remaining risk of the "Condensing煞 and Refining Gang Qi" technique would be the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>And the jade Buddha can shatter the Heavenly Corpse Talisman…</p><p>Theoretically, even if Wu Shang's technique fails, there’s no risk to me.</p><p>But everything is conjecture, full of uncertainty. Unless I'm desperate, I won't take such a gamble.</p><p>I still have the Kanli Golden Pill, the Snow Spirit Lotus, and the Iris Flower – a pair famed for being the most beneficial spirit herbs for Golden Core cultivation. There's no need to rush down this path yet.</p><p>Dismissing these chaotic thoughts,</p><p>Qin Sang continued observing for a while before putting it back into the Corpse Puppet Bag.  The transformation of the corpse dan requires time; then it will truly be a Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang casually set up a Spirit Gathering Array and meditated to recover.</p><p>After regaining his full strength, Qin Sang immediately left the Earth-Sun Cave. He didn't even return to his sect, instead piloting the Youluo Cloud directly northeast.</p><p>Cultivation and corpse refinement have taken up so much time; I wonder if Ji Wu has delivered the Gui Fu Pill.</p><p>Qin Sang must make every second count; the longer he waits, the more unpredictable things will become.</p><p>Before dealing with the trouble caused by the Crow Robe Daoist, however, Qin Sang needed to do one thing: go to the Boundless Valley and subdue the evil Jiao's spirit soul to enhance the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman.</p><p>In case of any unforeseen circumstances, having a backup plan is essential.</p>
