<h1>Chapter 1737: Breaking Through the Gates</h1><p>The ancestral lands of the Phoenix Clan of the Demon Sea were not located on an island.  </p><p>In the northern region of the Demon Sea, there lay a lush, verdant realm, where ancient trees towered majestically.  </p><p>This area was more expansive than any jungle on land, yet all its roots were submerged in water. The white roots swayed in the sea like countless white serpents, with the longest tendrils extending into the unfathomable depths of the ocean.  </p><p>Beneath the water, the roots intertwined endlessly, forming an inseparable, boundless jungle that made one wonder if it had all sprouted from a single tree.  </p><p>Here, countless demonic birds thrived.  </p><p>At sunrise, as the morning mist dissipated, the air would fill with their chirping. Flocks of demonic birds would take to the skies, their colorful feathers shimmering in the sunlight, adorning the azure sky.  </p><p>The Phoenix Clan resided at the heart of this jungle.  </p><p>On this particular morning, a woman clad in vibrant robes flew in from the sea. Her features were exquisite, and her brows carried an air of martial prowess.  </p><p>At this moment, her expression was grave, and her phoenix-like eyes radiated an intimidating aura, exuding an overwhelming presence that made others feel an oppressive pressure in her presence.  </p><p>Even the demonic birds nesting at the edge of the jungle trembled at her approach, cowering in their nests, not daring to move.  </p><p>What terrified them was not just the aura of a demon king emanating from her, but also the unique bloodline aura she carried.  </p><p>It was the aura of a descendant of the Heavenly Phoenix.  </p><p>The ruler of the Demon Sea!  </p><p>Among the demonic birds here, some were not of the Phoenix Clan but had awakened intelligence. Upon seeing the woman from afar, they initially intended to approach, but upon meeting her gaze, they shuddered and dared not provoke her, instead bowing respectfully from a distance.  </p><p>The woman moved swiftly, heading straight for the heart of the jungle.  </p><p>As she neared the Phoenix Clan's territory, a patrol of demonic birds appeared ahead. Though their leader was only at the Demon Core stage, as a direct descendant of the Phoenix Clan, he had been granted the Emperor's Nectar early on, awakening his intelligence.  </p><p>"Greetings, Queen Jiufeng!"  </p><p>The leader and his subordinates prostrated themselves on the treetops, bowing their heads.  </p><p>This was their etiquette when facing a superior.  </p><p>Queen Jiufeng did not spare them a glance, maintaining her speed as she flew directly over them.  </p><p>The leader dared not show the slightest hint of dissatisfaction. Queen Jiufeng was their ruler, second only to the Phoenix King in the Phoenix Clan.  </p><p>In the Demon Sea, there was no title of "Great Sage." All transformed demon kings were simply referred to as kings, but the titles of Phoenix King and Phoenix Queen were unique to the rulers of the Phoenix Clan throughout the ages.  </p><p>Males were called Phoenix Kings, while females were called Phoenix Queens.  </p><p>In this generation, there was a Phoenix Queen but no Phoenix King.  </p><p>Queen Jiufeng had received her title during the early stages of her transformation, which might have seemed presumptuous, but it had been personally bestowed by the Phoenix Queen.  </p><p>She was one of nine siblings, the ninth in line, with eight older brothers. Yet, she had surpassed them all, earning the title of Queen Jiufeng.  </p><p>Queen Jiufeng had once disappeared for a long time, leading to various speculations among her clan. When the two realms were connected, she finally reappeared, achieving numerous feats in battles against the humans. Her reputation in the Demon Sea now rivaled that of the Phoenix Queen herself.  </p><p>The Phoenix Queen rarely made appearances, and the Phoenix Clan's tribes were all under Queen Jiufeng's command. The demon armies sent out were also led by her, a testament to her status within the clan.  </p><p>As she ventured deeper, the ancient trees grew even more verdant, exuding a spiritual beauty unmatched elsewhere.  </p><p>Wherever Queen Jiufeng passed, the tribes prostrated themselves, allowing her to proceed unimpeded until she reached the ancestral lands of the Phoenix Clan.  </p><p>Contrary to expectations, the ancestral lands at the heart of the jungle formed a hollow, exposing a vast expanse of sea, resembling a landlocked lake.  </p><p>Scattered across the sea were tree islands, some serving as important sites for the Phoenix Clan, others as the abodes of demon kings, all exuding powerful auras.  </p><p>The ancestral lands were heavily guarded, protected by demonic arrays.  </p><p>Even with Queen Jiufeng's status, she could not force her way in.  </p><p>The guards had already been informed, and two teams of demonic guards flew in from either side. Each was a formidable elite of the Phoenix Clan, and unlike the previous patrol, they did not falter in the face of Queen Jiufeng.  </p><p>If Queen Jiufeng violated the clan's rules, they would not hesitate to act.  </p><p>Queen Jiufeng produced a slender, colorful feather and made a gesture in the air, creating an invisible resonance.  </p><p>The guards' expressions softened, and they all prostrated themselves in reverence. "Greetings, Queen Jiufeng."  </p><p>At the same time, a black streak of light flew out from the depths of the ancestral lands, landing swiftly before Queen Jiufeng and revealing a handsome man with black wings.  </p><p>"Jiufeng, weren't you stationed at Luoying Island? Why have you returned to the ancestral lands now?"  </p><p>The man's tone was not accusatory but affectionate, his eyes filled with admiration.  </p><p>"The humans are making moves," Queen Jiufeng replied curtly, not mincing words, and moved to bypass him.  </p><p>The man tactfully stepped aside but followed behind her. "The clan has already received reports of disturbances on the Great Wilderness Island. You usually oversee the situation there personally, monitoring the humans. Now you've returned from afar. Has something major happened?"  </p><p>Queen Jiufeng seemed impatient, her expression darkening as she suddenly increased her speed. "I must see the Phoenix Queen immediately. If you wish to know more, ask her yourself."  </p><p>The man, having been rebuffed, dared not press further. Watching Queen Jiufeng's retreating figure, a flicker of sorrow passed through his eyes.  </p><p>The ancestral lands of the Phoenix Clan were not vast.  </p><p>Flying past numerous tree islands, Queen Jiufeng soon arrived at a true spirit island.  </p><p>The island was enveloped in a thin mist, rich in spiritual energy, with magnificent palaces visible among the exotic flowers and plants.  </p><p>As Queen Jiufeng approached the island, before she could land, she suddenly felt an overwhelming pressure bearing down on her.  </p><p>She halted mid-air, not daring to move.  </p><p>The next moment, a commanding female voice emanated from the center of the island. "Jiufeng, why have you returned without notice?"  </p><p>Queen Jiufeng bowed slightly. "The situation has changed. I dared not make decisions on my own and have come to seek the Phoenix Queen's guidance."  </p><p>"Oh?"  </p><p>The mist slowly parted, revealing a woman in a multicolored gown, wearing a phoenix crown. She was crouching beside a flower bed, seemingly admiring the vibrant spiritual flowers before her.  </p><p>The woman stood up and looked over, her beauty unparalleled, making even Queen Jiufeng pale in comparison.  </p><p>"Have the humans taken Luoying Island?"  </p><p>The Phoenix Queen's gaze was steady, her tone calm.  </p><p>At this question, Queen Jiufeng's body trembled.  </p><p>The Phoenix Queen sighed softly. "Do you know why I allowed you to enter?"  </p><p>Her words were clearly not directed at Queen Jiufeng, as her gaze shifted to someone behind her.  </p><p>She walked forward gracefully, her colorful gown swaying. "The humans have taken Luoying Island and sealed it off, thinking their actions would remain hidden. Little do they know, our clan has ways of sensing such things. I never expected that even you, Jiufeng, would fall into their hands. Worse, you did not choose to end your life but instead led the enemy here to assassinate me. It seems they have mastered some formidable techniques or treasures..."  </p><p>As the Phoenix Queen approached, her tone grew increasingly stern.  </p><p>At the same time, the surrounding mist rippled, and shadowy figures with powerful auras emerged, surrounding them.  </p><p>These were demon kings who should have been in seclusion, yet they had been summoned back to the spirit island by the Phoenix Queen, lying in ambush.  </p><p>This was clearly a trap!  </p><p>Queen Jiufeng's sudden arrival had caught the ancestral lands off guard, and few demon kings were present. But with the Phoenix Queen's support, they were more than enough to capture any intruder!  </p><p>Queen Jiufeng seemed to regain her senses.  </p><p>With each word from the Phoenix Queen, her face grew more desperate and ashamed, yet she was bound by an invisible force, unable to move.  </p><p>Her eyes bloodshot, she struggled to speak but could not. Finally, overwhelmed by frustration, she spat out a mouthful of blood, the light in her eyes rapidly fading.  </p><p>"At least she died with dignity."  </p><p>A voice suddenly rang out from behind, and a figure slowly materialized—a Daoist priest.  </p><p>As he appeared, Queen Jiufeng's body collapsed, transforming back into her phoenix-tailed bird form mid-air and falling into the sea, eliciting cries of grief.  </p><p>Her massive body created a huge splash as it hit the water, lifeless.  </p><p>The Phoenix Queen stared intently at the Daoist who had appeared out of thin air, her killing intent palpable, yet her eyes also held shock and confusion. "Who are you?"  </p><p>The Daoist was none other than Qin Sang's external incarnation, whom the Phoenix Queen naturally did not recognize.  </p><p>The other demon kings were equally astonished. This man showed no fear in the presence of the Phoenix Queen, clearly a powerful cultivator. The humans had somehow produced another formidable figure, willing to risk sending him alone into the heart of the Phoenix Clan's ancestral lands to assassinate the Phoenix Queen.  </p><p>The incarnation remained silent, a black light flashing in his right hand as he summoned a tattered banner full of holes. With a flick of his wrist, demonic energy surged into the sky, coalescing into a humanoid figure beside him.  </p><p>This was Su Zinan, now transformed into a demonic soul.  </p><p>Su Zinan's expression was cold and emotionless, a black ruler floating before him. Anyone who met his gaze would feel a chill in their hearts.  </p><p>After refining the Three Corpses Soul-Severing Banner, the incarnation had yet to encounter an opponent worthy of his full strength.  </p><p>As the demonic soul appeared, the Phoenix Queen's pupils contracted, and a commotion broke out behind her.  </p><p>Not only was this man a powerful cultivator, but he also controlled a demonic soul no weaker than his main body. It was fortunate they had not let him succeed, or the consequences would have been dire.  </p><p>'Whoosh!'  </p><p>The incarnation pointed forward.  </p><p>The demonic soul's eyes gleamed with killing intent as the black ruler split into countless shadows, momentarily blotting out the sky and plunging the surrounding sea into darkness. The shadows then converged with immense force, striking directly at the Phoenix Queen's forehead.  </p><p>"Kill him!"  </p><p>The Phoenix Queen roared.  </p><p>Such a formidable opponent must not be allowed to escape!  </p><p>Her colorful gown erupted with radiant light, the three exquisite phoenix patterns on it coming to life. The phoenixes soared into the sky, intercepting the black ruler just before it struck.  </p><p>'Boom!'  </p><p>Black light and multicolored radiance clashed, obscuring the black ruler and the phoenixes.  </p><p>At the same time, a crimson vortex suddenly appeared beneath the incarnation, emanating an infinite suction force, like a gaping maw.  </p><p>Within the vortex was not just suction but also chaotic, unknown forces.  </p><p>The incarnation, however, seemed prepared. A green light flashed at his chest as a piece of bark-like armor appeared, hovering above the vortex. The green light continuously emanated, containing immense power.  </p><p>The armor seemed embedded in the vortex, neither rising nor falling, rendering the crimson vortex powerless against it.  </p><p>Yet, the Phoenix Clan, having prepared for this, would not rely on such a simple tactic.  </p><p>As the demonic soul attacked, the mist dispersed, revealing the figures of numerous demon kings surrounding them. Most shared similar bloodline auras and simultaneously unleashed identical techniques.  </p><p>Behind each of them, the phantom of their demonic forms appeared. Though their shapes varied, all bore traces of their phoenix lineage.  </p><p>Unlike Qin Sang's main body's dharma form, these were manifestations of their techniques. The phantoms shattered instantly, transforming into strange spiritual lights that shot forth, each a different color—green, red, and more—corresponding to their respective clans.  </p><p>The man who had earlier stared at the incarnation with hatred now shot forth a black spiritual light.  </p><p>All the spiritual lights targeted the incarnation.  </p><p>Under sudden siege, the incarnation remained calm. Just as he was about to act, he noticed something unusual. The spiritual lights dissipated into nothingness a hundred zhang away from him, as if they had never existed.  </p><p>The next moment, the incarnation felt a wave of dizziness, and the surroundings transformed. He was now trapped within a multicolored barrier.  </p><p>He could still see the demon kings around him, but streams of light flowed between them, seemingly pushing them further away.  </p><p>The incarnation glanced around. He had not moved, yet he felt that if he tried to pursue them now, he might exhaust himself before reaching them.  </p><p>This was, of course, an illusion, but for someone of lower cultivation, it would indeed lead to exhaustion and death.  </p><p>The streams of light were everywhere, like a tide.  </p><p>The incarnation looked up and saw what appeared to be a multicolored sun forming above, with streams of light continuously converging toward it.  </p><p>He sensed the threat and knew he could not allow this sun to fully form. With a flick of his sleeve, he shot forth a cold light, finally summoning the Fourfold Ice Serpent Seal!  </p><p>The blue cold light formed a radiant halo, with the densest areas resembling clusters of icy flames.  </p><p>'Whoosh!'  </p><p>Within the icy flames, two massive creatures appeared, playfully chasing each other.  </p><p>Seeing this, the confident demon kings paled, and someone exclaimed, "A spirit treasure!"  </p><p>Before the words faded, the two ice serpents raised their heads, their eyes fixed on the multicolored sun. Riding the icy flames, they roared and charged toward the sky, while the demonic soul also directed the black ruler at the sun.  </p><p>At this moment, if someone were observing the battlefield from afar, they would see the incarnation and the demonic soul surrounded by demon kings, with no visible anomalies, merely a standoff.  </p><p>Suddenly, an earth-shaking roar erupted.  </p><p>The ancestral lands of the Phoenix Clan were engulfed in towering waves.  </p><p>The space around the incarnation shattered like a mirror, and the multicolored lights reappeared, now in complete disarray. Two majestic ice serpents burst forth, spewing vast waves of icy flames.  </p><p>The demon kings were caught off guard, unable to react in time.  </p><p>The Phoenix Queen, in the midst of casting a spell, was shocked that her technique had been broken so quickly. Her expression shifted several times before she let out a cold snort. With a wave of her hand, a phoenix claw suddenly appeared above the two ice serpents, as if attacking from another dimension, appearing out of nowhere.  </p><p>With the phoenix claw's appearance, the chaotic lights stabilized, converging toward it and forming a massive claw that pressed down on the serpents.  </p><p>This was equivalent to a combined attack from Queen Jiufeng and the demon kings.  </p><p>The ice serpents roared, spewing icy flames that merged mid-air, joining forces with the demonic soul to strike directly at the claw's palm.  </p><p>'Boom!'  </p><p>A dazzling array of lights erupted.  </p><p>The Phoenix Queen was about to continue her attack when she suddenly sensed something and her expression changed drastically. She cried out in alarm and swiftly retreated from the battlefield, reappearing above the spirit island.  </p><p>At this moment.  </p><p>Before an ancient hall on the spirit island.  </p><p>Qin Sang's main body had somehow arrived here. He stood before the hall, sealed by a five-colored barrier, his hand resting on it, his eyes gleaming with curiosity.  </p><p>In his perception, the barrier was extraordinary, with a familiar energy flowing through it—likely originating from that broken feather.  </p><p>The Phoenix Queen, realizing the danger, rushed over.  </p><p>Qin Sang looked up and smiled slightly. With a wave of his finger, the Seven Mansions Star Formation manifested in the sky, enveloping a vast expanse and isolating the Phoenix Queen from the seal within the hall.  </p><p>Then, he raised his hand, revealing a spiritual tree.  </p><p>Six firebirds flapped their wings and flew off the tree, charging toward the ancient hall!  </p><p></p>
