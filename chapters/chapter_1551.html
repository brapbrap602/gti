<h1>Chapter 1542:  A Peaceful World, Tranquil Waters</h1><p>Chapter 1542:  A Peaceful World, Tranquil Waters</p><p>Sai Prefecture.</p><p>Six-Prefecture Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang, fingers toying with a jade cup, gazed at the river flowing eastward outside the window, lost in thought.</p><p>At this moment, the door opened softly, and a steward entered, returning an item to Qin Sang.  "We've found it, Daoist friend. Your friend left the item in Fufu County, Zhuo Prefecture, seven years ago. More detailed information will take some time. We'll contact the Zhuo Prefecture branch and await their report."</p><p>Zhuo Prefecture.</p><p>One of the Four Northern Prefectures.</p><p>The Four Northern Prefectures are roughly arranged in a diamond shape.</p><p>Ze Prefecture is to the northwest, bordering Sai Prefecture and the Northern Wastelands. Qin Sang and Zhou Jin first arrived in Ze Prefecture after leaving the Northern Wastelands.</p><p>However, the northernmost prefecture in the Nineteen Rain-Kissed Prefectures is actually Zhaoyao Prefecture, named after the famous Zhaoyao Mountain.  The mountain range stretches across most of the Four Northern Prefectures, serving as a significant boundary between the Central Plains and the Northern Wastelands.</p><p>Jin Yu Prefecture, located in the east of the four prefectures, is a prosperous coastal prefecture, the most flourishing of the four, and is sometimes called the "Little Jiangzuo of the North."</p><p>The powerful Jin Yu Sect is based in Jin Yu Prefecture. Its wealth is renowned in the Central Plains. The similarity in names between the sect and the prefecture is intriguing, though the origin is now untraceable.</p><p>Zhuo Prefecture lies in the southernmost part of the Four Northern Prefectures, closest to the Six Jiangzuo Prefectures. While not as prosperous, it's still one of the Nineteen Rain-Kissed Prefectures, superior to the Western Desert and the Northern Wastelands.</p><p>Even in the most prosperous places, there are inevitably impoverished areas.</p><p>Fufu County is one such place.</p><p>However, it happens to contain a superior Daoist training ground mentioned by Xiao Xiangzi, a place Qin Sang previously instructed Zhou Jin to investigate thoroughly.</p><p>Seven years ago, Zhou Jin entered Fufu County, and has remained there since.  This suggests either an unforeseen incident or the discovery of a crucial clue that requires further investigation.</p><p>Qin Sang, lost in thought, stood up and thanked the steward. As he was about to leave the quiet room, he paused, turning back to ask, "Has anything significant happened recently in the Central Plains?"</p><p>The steward replied with a smile, "The world is at peace; the rivers and seas are calm."</p><p>"Peace is precious..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded gently and left the Six-Prefecture Hall.</p><p>...</p><p>The Tiantuo River originates from the Xuelian Mountains, flows through Sai Prefecture, and connects to the great lake of Ze Prefecture.</p><p>In Ze Prefecture, a major branch flows south, then turns east, passing through the Six Jiangzuo Prefectures before finally emptying into the East Sea.</p><p>Some consider these two sections as parts of the same river, but over time they’ve acquired different names. The upper section remains the Tiantuo River, while the lower section is called the Fu River.</p><p>The Six Jiangzuo Prefectures lie along the banks of the Fu River.</p><p>"Sir, we've arrived at the county city."</p><p>The waiter's voice came from outside the cabin.</p><p>In the Four Northern Prefectures, water travel is the most convenient, although not as fast as Qin Sang’s escape techniques, it is less strenuous and less conspicuous.</p><p>Traveling by boat, passing through Ze Prefecture and using a tributary of the Fu River, they smoothly arrived at the county city of Fufu County in Zhuo Prefecture.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke and looked at his body-double sitting opposite him.</p><p>The external body-double's palms were pressed together on his lap, palms facing upward, with four serpentine seals hovering above, emitting a faint cold light.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit array isolated the spiritual treasure's light and fluctuations within the small cabin.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang aided his body-double in cultivating the *Tongbao Scripture*, refining the spiritual treasure.</p><p>Since departing from the North Sea, the external body-double had been attempting to cultivate the *Ice Soul Divine Light*, but progress was unsatisfactory. Qin Sang decided to let the body-double cease cultivating divine abilities and focus on refining the spiritual treasure, to quickly master a powerful technique.</p><p>He stood up and opened the window.</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, unable to see the Western Desert.</p><p>The setting sun's light shone into the cabin, falling on his face.</p><p>Just like that day, the sky was filled with golden light.</p><p>Since Liuli's departure, whenever he saw such a scene, Qin Sang would remember that figure disappearing into the sunset.</p><p>He understood Liuli, because he would have made the same choice.</p><p>Therefore, he wouldn't try to dissuade her.</p><p>He could only offer silent blessings and steadfastly pursue his own path, believing that they would meet again in the future.</p><p>Qin Sang had persisted the longest during the refinement of the Buddha bone relic, reaping the greatest benefits.</p><p>He sensed that future breakthroughs would be much easier, and with the double boost from the killing talisman and the cleansing pool, reaching the late Yuan Ying stage was imminent.</p><p>The only thing left to do was find a stable Daoist training ground and diligently cultivate until his breakthrough!</p><p>As for the body-double, both Kan Shen pearls had been refined. Using them solely for cultivation enhancement, it was likely the body-double would reach the late stage bottleneck before the main body, but a breakthrough would be much harder.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't expect to have a body-double at the same stage after his breakthrough.</p><p>He had a plan.</p><p>In the future, his main body would remain in seclusion to cultivate the Dao, and once his body-double's *Tongbao Scripture* reached its peak, the body-double would travel the Central Plains to seek various clues.</p><p>To this end, Qin Sang had been considering how to strengthen his control over his body-double, preventing the body-double from developing demonic thoughts and rebelling against him.</p><p>The distance between my physical body and my spirit body is too great.  Should anything unexpected happen, I wouldn't be able to react quickly enough.  In the worst-case scenario, a powerful enemy could seize control, leading to irreversible consequences.</p><p>Of course, a spirit body wielding a magical artifact isn't easily captured, unless it provokes a cultivator at the Metamorphosis stage.  However, Qin Sang's goal is simply to gather information; he won't readily engage in conflict.</p><p>During the journey, Qin Sang devoted himself primarily to this task, studying the various cultivation techniques and secret arts he obtained from the Xuan Tian Palace.  His efforts have borne fruit.  His spirit body only needs to return to his cave dwelling periodically, allowing his second Nascent Soul to merge with his main body, restoring his unified spiritual state.</p><p>All in all, there's quite a lot to do.</p><p>Through the Six States Hall's network, I found no news of Gui Mu's whereabouts.  Qin Sang settled for asking if there were any Wu tribe cultivators in the Central State.</p><p>If Gui Mu reached the Central State safely, she would undoubtedly be searching for the Wu tribe as well.</p><p>The Six States Hall, true to its reputation, located several ancient texts containing records of the Wu tribe.  Unfortunately, these were mostly ambiguous accounts from ancient legends.</p><p>At least, there are no Wu tribe members on the mainland.</p><p>As for overseas territories, the Six States Hall lacks the reach.</p><p>The ship docked.</p><p>The hull shuddered.</p><p>Retracting his spirit body, Qin Sang disembarked.</p><p>Distant mountains loomed, dark and hazy, while the dock bustled with activity—porters, merchants, sailors, and travelers thronged the area.</p><p>Qin Sang moved through the crowd, seemingly amidst the throng but effortlessly maintaining a slight distance from those around him, his actions unnoticed by ordinary people.</p><p>Upon entering the city, passing by the prefecture's office, Qin Sang sensed the presence of cultivators within.</p><p>This is the greatest difference between the Central State and other regions.  In the Central State, the walled cities and county seats serve not only as gathering places for cultivators, but also bear the responsibility of governing and educating the populace.  Furthermore, these posts are held by cultivators, preventing mortals from establishing independent kingdoms.</p><p>Whether the cultivators in the Central State truly value ordinary people, Qin Sang doesn't know.</p><p>But he understands that the presence of these cultivator magistrates severely restricts independent cultivators and smaller sects, preventing them from acting arbitrarily. Every action must be within the established rules.</p><p>Even in a remote place like Fudu County, there is a Foundation Establishment stage magistrate.  This individual likely hails from the Bu Nian Mountain, the largest sect in Zhuo State.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't visit the magistrate, choosing instead to discreetly enter the market area and find a small courtyard. Fudu County is too remote to warrant a full Six States Hall presence; they only have a small liaison office.  Nevertheless, the courtyard is refined and elegant, situated in the heart of the market, showcasing their considerable wealth.</p><p>He met with the Six States Hall's manager in the courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang presented his credentials and stated his purpose.</p><p>The manager bowed, quickly returning to the inner chamber to retrieve the matching token.  After verifying its authenticity, he said, "The friend you mentioned left no further message. However, he visits our establishment once a year, and has done so for seven years.  His next visit is less than two months away.  If you don't mind the humble accommodations, you may choose a private room..."</p><p>It seems Zhou Jin is alright, just delayed by something.</p><p>Seeing him will reveal the truth.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, tossing a pouch of spirit stones to the manager, "I have a few questions for you."</p><p>The manager weighed the pouch, a smile spreading across his face. "Please ask, sir. I will answer truthfully."</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to speak, his expression shifted slightly, and he made a soft inquiring sound.</p><p>Apologizing to the manager, Qin Sang sprang to his feet, hurrying out of the courtyard.  With a few quick leaps, he appeared outside the county walls.</p><p>By the time the manager emerged, Qin Sang was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Puzzled, the manager shook his head, "How strange!"</p><p>Leaving the county, Qin Sang looked around, choosing a direction and swiftly moving off.  Soon, he entered a deep mountain forest, away from human settlements.</p><p>He reached into his spirit beast pouch, withdrawing a fat insect.</p><p>After consuming the Amber Worm Crystal, the fat silkworm was even larger than before.</p><p>For years, the fat silkworm had been dormant within Ya Gu's body.  Now awake, it writhed in Qin Sang's palm, emitting mournful cries, seemingly in great pain.</p><p>Rings of multicolored aura emanated from the silkworm, highly unstable.</p><p>This aura…</p><p>It seems to be a transformation!</p><p>After trading with the Rotten Phosphorus Firefly King, the fat silkworm, having consumed its essence, fell into a weakened state.  Qin Sang had expected it to require a period of rest to recover.</p><p>The refining of the crystal would certainly take time, perhaps even a century.  He hadn't expected this breakthrough to be so imminent.</p><p>Even stranger, Qin Sang sensed that this creature was about to attract a heavenly tribulation, to directly undergo the tribulation!</p><p>"Why is there no cocoon stage?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the fat silkworm's previous two transformations.  Each time, it had spun a cocoon, remaining dormant for several years before the transformation.</p><p>This time, however, something unexpected occurred.</p><p>Could it be that the poison pill the fat silkworm swallowed, the one from the frog-fish, has brought it to the brink of a breakthrough?  Was its slumber within the Silent Nun during the storm passage actually a kind of pupation?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, seemingly finding no other explanation.  In the Seven Kills Hall, after the fat silkworm and the Silent Nun merged, both underwent unseen changes.</p><p>“Squeak…”</p><p>The fat silkworm's cry pulled Qin Sang from his thoughts. He activated his spiritual sense, scanning the silkworm's body.  Finding it relatively unharmed, he suspected it hadn't fully absorbed the Amber Insect crystal before molting. This clearly showed the Amber Insect crystal was a rare treasure.</p><p>Molting is always a good thing. The Fire Jade Centipede, however, continued stuffing itself with Fire Melting Pills, showing no signs of molting.  However, Qin Sang worried. This useless fat silkworm, only capable of detoxification, could it withstand the tribulation? He wasn't its master; he could only use a spirit array to weaken the tribulation thunder.</p><p>Further thought was futile. Qin Sang dispersed his spiritual sense, heading towards a desolate, uninhabited area to avoid the unknown effects of the tribulation.</p><p>Just then, the fat silkworm underwent another change. The rainbow aura ceased expanding and began to contract, finally coalescing into a single, multicolored orb.  The fat silkworm forcefully lifted its head, eagerly swallowing the orb.  Then, more rainbow aura emanated from its body.  It seemed unable to control its own power.</p><p>Qin Sang then noticed the new rainbow aura was far denser than before, quickly forming a thick layer over the silkworm. If the previous detoxification armor was just a thin membrane, this was true armor!</p><p>"Spiritual insects all have their own life-saving methods," Qin Sang mused.</p><p>After the detoxification armor formed, the tribulation aura around the fat silkworm intensified, and tribulation clouds gathered in the sky. Qin Sang looked up, sensing the tribulation. Unsurprisingly, its power wasn't strong, much like the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's tribulation years ago.</p><p>With the tribulation imminent, Qin Sang surveyed the area, then flew to the mountaintop. Looking down, he saw the fat silkworm completely enveloped in thick rainbow light, forming a cocoon-like structure.</p><p>Placing the silkworm on the ground, Qin Sang began his preparations. His Thousand-Jun Ring flashed repeatedly, releasing palm-sized golden talismans.  Before leaving, he had anticipated the possibility of a sudden tribulation and made preparations.</p><p>In an instant, dozens of talismans formed a large array, merging with the void.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>The tribulation clouds churned, thunder deafening.  Birds and beasts in the forest panicked.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly completed the final incantation, withdrawing just as a bright flash filled his vision—a silver bolt of lightning descended from the heavens. The sun dimmed.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The tribulation thunder struck the fat silkworm directly. As it passed through the golden talisman array, the golden threads wove a net, but due to the tribulation's unique, heaven-sent power, even the most intricate array couldn't completely block it. The tribulation thunder pierced the array, striking the silkworm with its remaining power!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The earth shook, the mountain where the fat silkworm was located leveled, massive boulders tumbling down the cliff.</p><p>After the lightning strike, the tribulation clouds gradually dispersed. Qin Sang quickly flew over, sweeping his spiritual sense. He found the fat silkworm in a crevice, retrieved it, and examined it, revealing a surprised expression.  After the tribulation, the light cocoon seemed undamaged—either incredibly durable or incredibly fast at repairing itself.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The cocoon split open, and the fat silkworm poked its head out, showing no external injuries, only appearing slightly tired.  It inhaled the remaining rainbow aura, rubbed against Qin Sang's finger, and swayed its fat body, wanting to return to sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't let it off so easily.  Quickly erasing traces of their presence, he vanished, then held the fat silkworm before him, ordering it to demonstrate its new abilities.</p><p>Having spent time with the silkworm, although not yet completely telepathic, he could get it to understand simple commands.</p><p>The fat silkworm nodded, spitting out the familiar rainbow aura, forming the detoxification armor around Qin Sang.  Besides being thicker and seemingly offering stronger protection, it seemed unchanged.</p><p>Two pairs of eyes met.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged.</p><p>The fat silkworm looked innocent.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thanks to the generous patron, Qi Zhi You Zou, for the generous donation.</p>
