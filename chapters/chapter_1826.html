Chapter 1817: Qilin


The mountain cave appeared to be the lair of the black skeleton.


Suddenly, the sound of cracking bones echoed from within.


The sound was muffled.


Qin Sang’s fingers rubbed black powder, having just crushed one of the black skeleton's bones.


Virulent poison permeated the bone marrow; the skeleton was completely decayed, not a trace of white could be seen on its entire body.


Bone dust簌簌fell from his fingertips.


Qin Sang stared at the White Jade Elder statue for a long time, his eyes flickering. Lines of scripture from the *Poison God Classic* flashed continuously through his mind.


This sacred text of the Poison Dao was incredibly bizarre. Ordinary people would certainly avoid it like a tiger, yet Qin Sang gained some inspiration from it, even having the thought of trying it himself.


He sat cross-legged before the altar at some point, eyes slightly closed, lost in thought. As his comprehension of the *Poison God Classic* deepened, the thought became even more intense.


The *Poison God Classic* was a complete inheritance, encompassing foundational cultivation techniques and corresponding divine abilities, various poison control methods, a compendium of worldly poisons, some poison formulas, and most importantly, the secret art of refining the body with poison.


The cultivation method could be practiced up to the peak of the late Nascent Soul stage, breaking through the five Talisman Ranks, that is, until stepping into the Soul Formation stage.


This was not a cultivation method that led directly to the Great Dao. The *Poison God Classic* didn't have sections or volumes, possibly because the creator of the method stopped here, unable to further deduce it.


It was understandable. After all, this kind of cultivation method was too extreme, courting death to achieve life.


The *Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter* sought enlightenment through slaughter, but with the improvement of one's realm, the killing intent could be gradually suppressed. The *Poison God Classic*, however, never changed its original intention; its creator seemed very stubborn.


The creators of such methods were all incredibly talented individuals, yet they also faced unimaginable dangers. One wrong step could lead to eternal damnation.


Grand Patriarchs mostly came from Immortal Sects. Qin Sang had befriended quite a few fellow cultivators in Mount Juzhi, and from their conversations, among the sects in Mount Juzhi, only the Yin Tian Palace was confirmed to have a Grand Patriarch.


The creator of the *Poison God Classic* being able to reach the Soul Formation stage and leave behind such a complete inheritance was remarkable, worthy of the title Poison God.


Qin Sang opened his eyes and looked at the White Jade Elder statue. Could the old man carved on it be the creator?


If the black skeleton was a descendant of the elder, it would be normal for him to piously kowtow before the statue of his ancestor.


His mind returned to the *Poison God Classic*.


He would definitely try the secret art of tempering the body with poison. His promise to Grand Pure Sovereign back then was partly due to this secret art. What Qin Sang was considering now was how to utilize the foundational cultivation method of the *Poison God Classic*.


According to the *Poison God Classic*, refining poison into Yuan Qi, as long as sufficient high-grade poisons were provided, could greatly increase the speed of cultivation. This was what tempted Qin Sang the most.


Changing cultivation methods was absolutely impossible. Losing the seven Slaughter Talismans of the *Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter*, his cultivation speed would immediately drop significantly.


If the *Poison God Classic* were a legitimate cultivation method leading directly to the Great Dao, it would be a different story. Forcibly walking the Poison Dao, even if it brought temporary benefits, had an unpredictable future. A simple evaluation showed that the gains didn't outweigh the losses.


So, could he draw on the essence of the *Poison God Classic* and adapt it for his own use?


The core principle of the *Poison God Classic* was to devour virulent poisons and transform them into Poison Yuan, thereby achieving the goal of rapidly increasing cultivation.


Through comprehending the method, Qin Sang discovered that the foundation of this method revolved around refining poison into Yuan Qi, and the essence of refining poison into Yuan Qi was using external substances for cultivation.


Qin Sang's idea was to extract only the part about refining poison into Yuan Qi, integrate it into his own method, and use it selectively.


Qin Sang had done this kind of thing before. The *Celestial Demon Body Refining* method was cultivated forcibly after discarding the parts related to demonic bloodlines.


Without cultivating the complete method, the corresponding Poison Dao divine abilities couldn't be used, but this wasn't important. As long as it could assist his cultivation, it was enough.


Furthermore, the cultivation method of the *Poison God Classic* must have been meticulously created for Poison Yuan, making it the most compatible. Without cultivating this method, there would inevitably be inconsistencies, and the Poison Yuan might not be controllable, becoming a hidden danger, even disrupting his True Yuan and shaking his foundation.


The *Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter* had one unique aspect compared to other methods. It originated from the Slaughter Dao, its form was formless, yet it encompassed everything. This was why Qin Sang had this idea. Even if the method couldn't completely control the Poison Yuan, he could still suppress it with the power of the Poison Pearl.


There were two reasons why Qin Sang dared to entertain this idea, despite the risks of the *Poison God Classic*.


First, he saw a real possibility, and the prospects were very tempting.


Second, he was confident in minimizing the risks.


The Poison Pearl could suppress the toxins for him, delaying the onset of poisoning.


When devouring the sacred object of Myriad Venom Mountain and restoring the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit, Qin Sang confirmed that the more high-grade poisons he devoured, the more the Poison Pearl would grow. At least it hadn't reached its limit yet.


This also showed how unfathomable the Fat Silkworm’s talent was, that a single separated Poison Pearl was so extraordinary.


Starlight Body Tempering and Poison Tempering, his physical body would undergo a double refinement.  The speed of improvement would be astonishing.


Even if his cultivation couldn't advance to Soul Formation in time, as long as his physical body broke through, he could avert danger. The *Poison God Classic* clearly stated that a breakthrough in either the physical body or True Yuan could resolve the crisis.


As long as he made sufficient contributions to the Immortal Sects, he could ask a Grand Patriarch to help him, using talismans to guide Star Yuan into his body. This wasn’t a concern.


Moreover, if Poison Tempering was as miraculous as described in the secret art, the requirements for Star Yuan might even be lower.


The biggest limitation of the *Poison God Classic* was the difficulty in finding enough high-grade poisons, and this was precisely what Qin Sang didn’t lack.


The vast flower field outside had accumulated who knew how much flower nectar. It would be a pity not to make good use of it.


Thinking of this, Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he got up and walked out of the cave.


‘Creak…’


The stone door opened, and Qin Sang stepped out.


The unfamiliar aura immediately alerted the Flower Spirits, and flower cocoons emerged from the stamens.


At this moment, Qin Sang formed a strange hand seal with a single palm and pressed it against his chest, his aura instantly changing.


In an instant, the flower field returned to tranquility. The gently trembling cocoons stopped opening, slowly falling back into the stamens, and the Flower Spirits continued to sleep.


He was using a secret technique from the *Poison God Classic* to alter his aura, deceiving the Flower Spirits' perception and making them see him as one of their own. Cultivating these poisonous flowers required knowledge of this technique.


Seeing the technique work, Qin Sang nodded secretly, quietly flying to a mountain peak, then flying along the edge of the space, inspecting the Spirit Formation here, all the way without disturbing any Flower Spirits.


The flower fields had different grades, with the two deepest ones being top-grade flower fields.


Qin Sang arrived behind the two top-grade flower fields and looked towards the peak that had startled him before.


According to the *Poison God Classic*, this place could be considered an aperture of the flower field, with a special function.


There was a hidden danger in cultivating a large number of these poisonous flowers.


If the flower nectar wasn’t collected in time, it would fuse with resentment and give birth to Flower Fairies within the Flower Spirits.


The Flower Fairy was the evil spirit Qin Sang had slain.


The secret techniques of the *Poison God Classic* could only deceive Flower Spirits, not Flower Fairies.


Flower Fairies were innately imbued with deep resentment, which couldn't be dispelled. They were inherently cruel and would kill any living being they encountered, posing a danger to the owner of the flower field.


To prevent the flower field from giving birth to powerful Flower Fairies that would usurp it, special arrangements were made.  If the flower nectar wasn't collected for a long time, it would flow to the aperture.


The black skeleton had been dead for who knew how long, and the nectar continuously flowed in. It was unimaginable how much flower nectar had accumulated in the aperture.


Concentrated toxins emanated from the aperture, enveloping the peak. Qin Sang felt the danger from afar and didn't dare approach.


The aperture wouldn't give birth to Flower Fairies and wouldn't affect the flower field for now. Qin Sang wasn't planning to deal with it yet, intending to explore it later when he had the ability.


He took out the round pearl and played with it in his hand.


The pearl seemed pure, but it actually contained a shocking amount of resentment, making it unsuitable for cultivation.


Refining the pearl would indeed yield a large amount of Poison Yuan, but it would also affect his mind with resentment, causing a drastic change in his temperament.


Therefore, there was a particular timing for collecting flower nectar. It had to be the purest nectar.


As long as pure flower nectar was consistently used, he wouldn't be affected by resentment.


“Poison Flower, Flower Spirit, Flower Fairy…”


Qin Sang murmured these words.


Would pure flower nectar really not cause a change in temperament?


Qin Sang turned to look at the flower field.


The flowers swayed, so beautiful.


The *Poison God Classic* recorded that the name of this flower was Flower Spirit. This Flower Spirit was not that Flower Spirit; it referred to the main body of the spiritual flower, without sentience.


But this poisonous flower was too strange, and it could give birth to Flower Fairies, indicating the possibility of it gaining sentience. Qin Sang didn’t dare completely believe the records.


Was the flower nectar nourished by resentment truly pure? Were there any unknown hidden dangers within the cultivation method?


For instance, what if the White Jade Elder statue wasn’t of the creator, but of an Evil God?


Cultivating the *Poison God Classic* would ultimately lead to being entangled by resentment, turning oneself into a believer and sacrifice of the Evil God.


Qin Sang sneered. Resentment would inevitably affect the Primordial Spirit. If the *Poison God Classic* was a trap of an Evil God, it had targeted the wrong person.


Of course, Qin Sang hadn't discovered any signs related to an Evil God yet; it was just a speculation.


The Jade Buddha gave Qin Sang the confidence to try, but he wouldn't be reckless.


Qin Sang roughly formed a plan.


First, he would try refining the poison of the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit to confirm that he could cultivate Poison Yuan, then refine this round pearl to ensure that the Jade Buddha could expel resentment.  Only then could he cultivate with peace of mind.


Qin Sang looked around the entire space. If everything worked out, this place would be where he rose to power, relying on these flower fields to reach unimaginable heights in a very short time.


Compared to cultivators of the same rank, he was still young and seemingly didn't need to rush, but to find the path to ascension before the Immortal Sects, he had to increase his strength quickly.


Moreover, since he had obtained this opportunity, after weighing the gains and losses and the risks, there was no reason to miss it.


Time was never too much.  Breaking through one day earlier would add a bit more possibility of achieving the Great Dao in the future.


As for the pain that refining poison into Yuan Qi and Poison Tempering would bring to his body, Qin Sang didn't care. What pain could compare to being turned into a Refined Corpse?


Thinking of this, Qin Sang was eager to return to the cave, but he had to do one thing first.


His figure flashed repeatedly, flying to a mountain peak in the center of the space, sitting cross-legged, his divine sense spreading out, sensing the entire formation.


A moment later, the mountains shook, and a rumbling sound echoed among the peaks.


Above the sky, in all directions of the space, the distorting force manifested by the Spirit Formation vibrated violently, forming a storm that swept towards the sky.


To the naked eye, it looked as if someone was wielding a brush and splashing ink in the heavens.


Qin Sang was extremely busy, his ten fingers flicking, True Yuan pouring out, transforming into streaks of restrictive runes flying in all directions.


This was to repair the Spirit Formation.


As time passed, the Spirit Formation had warped, exposing the flower fields. Qin Sang now wanted to seal the space again, preventing others from intruding, claiming the flower fields for himself.


The unusual phenomena outside were more intense than inside the space.


Where the palace once stood, howling winds spread outwards, the fog banks disintegrating, giving birth to new whirlwinds that swept across the area.


This wasn't ordinary wind. It was fused with poisonous mist, and within the gale, large swathes of light blue flowers bloomed, then shattered piece by piece, a cycle of life and death, indicating that the void seemed about to shatter.


At this moment, outside the Poison Lake, Grand Pure Sovereign and Venerable Bo Xian sat and stood, respectively. They had just taken medicinal pills and were taking turns healing their injuries and detoxifying.


They keenly sensed the changes within the Poison Lake.  Grand Pure Sovereign, who was sitting in meditation, abruptly stood up, exchanged a glance with Venerable Bo Xian, and immediately returned to the Poison Lake.


Passing through the outer layer of poisonous water, they immediately saw a giant fog bank. The fog bank was filled with extremely chaotic power, mixed with the glimmer of poisonous restrictions, rapidly spreading outwards.


The expressions of the two Patriarchs were incredibly grave.


Before the change, Qin Sang might have had a sliver of hope.  With the collapse of the Poison Lake's interior, Qin Sang, located at the center of the collapse, was surely dead.


Unless a miracle occurred.


Even if they risked their lives and rushed into the fog bank, they might not even find his body.


After a long silence, Venerable Bo Xian sighed, “Fortunately, fellow Daoist obtained that spiritual tree.  It's a pity about Daoist Qing Feng…”


Grand Pure Sovereign also sighed, “Neither alive nor dead, how can this poor Daoist explain this to True Person Zhi Jian?”


As far as they knew, this Daoist Qing Feng was a solitary cultivator without any sect or disciples, but True Person Zhi Jian valued him highly, even opening a cave dwelling for him in his own Daoist compound.


Within the flower field.


Qin Sang looked up at the sky and saw the two Patriarchs retreat from the Poison Lake through the Spirit Formation, then he sent several restrictions into the formation.


Withdrawing his gaze, he swept it over the flower field and noticed that some flower nectar had matured. It was time to collect it.


He took a jade bottle from his Qianjun Ring, landed in a flower field, and hovered above a spiritual flower.


The spiritual flower was enormous.


The center of its stamen was also like a silver basin.


The Flower Spirit was sleeping within the stamen. Qin Sang extended his right hand, True Yuan swirling in his palm, transforming into a transparent long needle after a series of changes.


He gently inserted the needle tip.


As if in pain, the spiritual flower's stamen suddenly constricted, its petals trembling, and only after a moment did they slowly unfurl.


Qin Sang withdrew the needle and flew to the next flower.


As he collected nectar from more and more spiritual flowers, a crystal-clear drop gradually condensed at the tip of the needle. This was pure flower nectar, pure flower poison!


Once a drop formed, it was stored in the jade bottle.


Like a bee or butterfly collecting pollen, Qin Sang busied himself in the flower field, finally arriving at the two top-grade flower fields.


The flower nectar produced by different fields didn't differ much in quality; it was just that fewer spiritual flowers were needed to condense a drop of nectar in the top-grade fields.


His movements became more and more proficient.  He quickly collected all the flower nectar, and with a wave of his hand, the jade bottles floated before him.


Qin Sang smiled faintly, storing them in his sleeve, and returned to the cave.


He probed the White Jade Elder statue with his divine sense again, reading the *Poison God Classic* several times, memorizing it by heart, and sat motionless.


Time was unknown within the Poison Lake.


Undisturbed in this place, Qin Sang didn't know how long he had been in meditative trance when he finally began to move.


The Poison Pearl flew out of his dantian, and the poison-repelling light shimmered, drawing out a wisp of virulent poison.


Qin Sang took a deep breath and absorbed it into his body!
