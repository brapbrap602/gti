<h1>Chapter 2077: A Letter</h1><p>“Greetings, Martial Uncle.”</p><p>“Greetings, Palace Lord Huan…”</p><p>……</p><p>Huan Hen landed before the temporary palace, withdrawing his escape light. He wore close-fitting attire, his long hair tied back, a long sword strapped to his back. His bearing was free and easy, his eyes sharp as blades, like a wandering swordsman of the Jianghu.</p><p>A sheathed spirit sword indicated a unique sword-nurturing technique.</p><p>Seeing him, the disciples of the Green Ram Sect bowed respectfully, their faces filled with awe.</p><p>These disciples also revered Li Yufu and Shen Chen, but the reverence was different. Their awe of Huan Hen outweighed their respect. Anyone who had witnessed his performance on the battlefield would be filled with fear.</p><p>In the Storm Realm, Huan Hen's fame was no less than that of Sect Master Li Yufu and the Heavenly Craft Alliance's Leader, Shen Chen.</p><p>He adhered to the Dao of the Killing Sword, thriving on the battlefield. In every battle, he was the first to charge, his sword soaring into enemy ranks. Sword light flickered, blood and severed limbs flew, and vibrant lives were instantly extinguished, leaving behind a trail of corpses, while his expression remained unchanged.</p><p>Both enemies and allies were chilled to the bone upon witnessing this scene.</p><p>Countless corpses lay beneath his sword; he was a powerhouse who had walked out of a sea of blood.</p><p>The disciples were incredibly respectful, not daring to breathe loudly, their heads lowered, avoiding Huan Hen’s gaze.</p><p>Huan Hen was aware of his reputation but had no intention of changing it. This was his Dao, and he didn't need to care about the opinions of others.</p><p>If his enemies feared him, their pre-battle trepidation was a good thing.</p><p>His expression was cold and stern. He merely uttered a faint "Mm" and walked past the disciples, appearing extremely aloof.</p><p>If they weren't fellow disciples, he wouldn't even bother to respond. However, the more indifferent he appeared, the more at ease they felt.</p><p>Even the disciples of the Green Ram Sect felt immense pressure in Huan Hen's presence. If he suddenly became amiable and instructive like other elders, they would only feel apprehensive.</p><p>Huan Hen restrained his sword intent, walked to the palace gate, and was about to activate the restriction to visit the Sect Master when a spiritual light flashed from the pendant at his waist.</p><p>His expression shifted slightly, and he paused, somewhat surprised. Then, in a flash, he vanished.</p><p>After Huan Hen's departure, the disciples collectively sighed in relief. Not daring to gossip about their elders, they dispersed.</p><p>At this moment, Huan Hen descended upon a nearby peak. This peak's height was comparable to the main peak where the temporary palace was located, but a grand formation concealed the summit, making it appear as an ordinary mountain from the outside.</p><p>The summit had been transformed into a regulated platform, to serve as a dueling arena for the Green Ram Sect disciples in the future.</p><p>Two figures stood on the arena: Shen Chen and Jian Nu.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Brother Shen.”</p><p>Huan Hen landed and bowed to Shen Chen.</p><p>He was Shangguan Lifeng's disciple. Qin Sang and Shangguan Lifeng were of the same generation, so Li Yufu recognized him as a martial brother.</p><p>However, after Shangguan Lifeng's fall, both Li Yufu and Shen Chen had guided Huan Hen extensively. Although addressed as Senior Brother, Huan Hen always treated them as elders, meticulous in his etiquette.</p><p>After the greeting, Huan Hen turned his gaze towards Jian Nu. He had noticed Jian Nu the moment he arrived.</p><p>Jian Nu stood silently, without even a perceptible fluctuation of spiritual energy, like a mortal. Yet, Huan Hen sensed a unique aura from Jian Nu, immediately recognizing him as a sword cultivator!</p><p>A strange glint flashed in Huan Hen's eyes. This person was unfathomable, his cultivation undoubtedly higher than his own. When did such a powerful sword cultivator appear in the Storm Realm?</p><p>Due to the limited quantity of Azure Spirit Qi, its allocation was carefully considered, based on an individual's talent, character, and other factors, prioritizing those with the greatest potential for breakthroughs.</p><p>Currently, over ninety percent of the Nascent Soul cultivators in the Storm Realm had achieved their breakthroughs with the aid of Azure Spirit Qi. Beneficiaries of its grace and bound by its karmic ties, these individuals had all appeared on the battlefield, their names widely known. They couldn't hide.</p><p>Of course, there was the possibility of someone secretly breaking through and hiding in fear of the Changyou Clan. Not everyone prioritized the greater good, and regardless of the circumstances, there were always those with ulterior motives.</p><p>Huan Hen didn't care about Jian Nu's origins. His instinctive reaction was that he had finally encountered a fellow expert with whom he could exchange insights on the sword Dao. The spirit sword on his back resonated, humming in response.</p><p>Sensing Huan Hen's battle intent, Shen Chen smiled. "Haven't you greeted Senior Jian Nu yet?"</p><p>Although he and Jian Nu were both at the Nascent Soul realm, Qin Sang addressed Jian Nu as a Dao companion and treated him with unusual respect, so Shen Chen addressed him as Senior.</p><p>Unless Tian Yue Shangren specifically instructed otherwise, Jian Nu didn't care for formalities and wouldn't speak much.</p><p>Upon first hearing the name 'Jian Nu' (Sword Slave), Shen Chen was slightly surprised. After all, who would use 'slave' as a title, demeaning themselves?</p><p>But to Huan Hen, this name held a different meaning. To call oneself a slave to the sword implied a heart solely dedicated to the sword, a pure sword cultivator!</p><p>A bright light flashed in Huan Hen's eyes, his battle intent growing stronger. His entire being resembled an unsheathed, sharp sword.</p><p>Shen Chen understood his martial brother's temperament and had anticipated this. He looked at Jian Nu. "Senior Jian Nu, this…"</p><p>Jian Nu readily replied, "I was just about to spar with young friend Huan Hen to exchange insights on the sword Dao!"</p><p>Shen Chen nodded, flashed away from the arena, and landed on the viewing platform nearby, fully activating the arena's formation.</p><p>Only Jian Nu and Huan Hen remained on the arena.</p><p>They stood ten zhang apart, facing each other.</p><p>Huan Hen, in his close-fitting attire, carried his sword on his back. The spirit sword vibrated frequently, its humming resonating like thunder, seemingly eager to fight for its master.</p><p>Accompanied by the humming, his aura continuously accumulated, climbing step by step, merging with his sword intent, his sharpness becoming increasingly intense.</p><p>In contrast, Jian Nu, dressed in black, stood with his feet slightly apart, his arms hanging naturally. His sword was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>His eyes were somewhat cloudy, lacking sharpness. He simply looked at Huan Hen calmly, like a weathered elder observing a fledgling youth.</p><p>‘Buzz, buzz, buzz…’</p><p>The humming of the sword echoed throughout the arena.</p><p>Suddenly, Huan Hen's eyes widened slightly, his aura reaching its peak, the humming abruptly ceasing.</p><p>Clang!  The spirit sword was partially drawn, the sword light flashing like autumn water, dazzling and brilliant.</p><p>At this moment, Shen Chen, who was watching from the viewing platform, changed his expression drastically. He abruptly stood up, his face full of shock.</p><p>The sword light dimmed. It hadn't left Huan Hen's back at all. The spirit sword, drawn only halfway from its sheath, froze there.</p><p>The spirit sword remained unsheathed, and Huan Hen hadn't moved a step. He stared intently ahead, where a sword pointed directly at the center of his brow, less than three inches away!</p><p>At the instant he was about to strike, an immense sense of danger descended. But before he could react with his sword, this other sword appeared before him.</p><p>Huan Hen possessed no protective treasures, only his sword and the ubiquitous sword intent surrounding him, which was his most prided defensive measure.</p><p>Sword intent formed the most solid barrier, capable of withstanding any attack. As an attack approached, it would be met with the fiercest counterattack, faster and more reliable than any protective treasure.</p><p>However, against Jian Nu, the sword intent barrier failed. The sword easily pierced through it, appearing abruptly before him. His protective sword intent didn't react, or perhaps it didn't have time to react.</p><p>If Jian Nu hadn't shown mercy, the sword would have already pierced his brow, penetrating his skull.</p><p>Huan Hen knew this was Jian Nu's sword, but he hadn't seen when Jian Nu had drawn it or what sword technique he had employed.</p><p>Huan Hen tried to find a reason for himself. If it wasn't a spar, if Jian Nu hadn't stopped, he would have been able to defend with his sword and wouldn't have been so utterly helpless. But after replaying the scenario repeatedly, the conclusion remained the same: He might have been able to block the first strike, but it would be difficult to block the second!</p><p>Battles between Nascent Soul cultivators involved the clash of Heavenly Might. Cultivators with higher cultivation could suppress their opponents with this power.</p><p>Huan Hen knew his cultivation was inferior to Jian Nu’s and had prepared for it. Yet, the other party clearly hadn’t used any Heavenly Might.</p><p>This was a fair duel, and he had lost, utterly defeated.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The spirit sword returned to its sheath. Huan Hen lowered his head. “I lose.”</p><p>The shock hadn’t faded from Shen Chen's eyes. While Huan Hen was certainly no match for Jian Nu, he hadn't expected the battle to end so quickly, with Huan Hen unable to even withstand a single blow.</p><p>No wonder Master valued Jian Nu so highly!</p><p>Shen Chen even began to wonder if Fairy Liu Li and the Changyou Clan Leader were Jian Nu’s match.</p><p>He was about to fly towards the arena when a figure materialized beside him—Li Yufu had arrived.</p><p>"Senior Brother…"</p><p>“I saw,” Li Yufu nodded, his eyes gleaming with admiration.  He sighed, “There are truly no mediocre individuals by Martial Uncle's side!”</p><p>Shen Chen wholeheartedly agreed.</p><p>The two landed on the arena and bowed respectfully to Jian Nu. They both looked at Huan Hen.</p><p>Huan Hen, oblivious to their arrival, stood motionless.  Jian Nu had retrieved his sword. Huan Hen's gaze was lowered, seemingly replaying the fight in his mind, immersed in it, his sword intent fluctuating.</p><p>Seeing his enlightenment, Jian Nu nodded inwardly. He was a promising talent.</p><p>After a while, Huan Hen regained his senses. Seeing Li Yufu, he hurriedly bowed. “Greetings, Sect Master.  I apologize for my rudeness.”</p><p>Li Yufu smiled and nodded. He bowed deeply to Jian Nu.  “Martial Brother Huan Hen single-mindedly pursues the Sword Dao but lacks a renowned master.  Would Senior be willing to offer him some guidance? We would be eternally grateful!”</p><p>Huan Hen's eyes shone with eagerness. He believed the Sword Dao demanded unwavering dedication but not blind arrogance. Any powerful sword cultivator could be his teacher.</p><p>Jian Nu glanced at Huan Hen and turned to walk off the arena.  "If you wish to learn the sword, follow me.”</p><p>"Thank you for your instruction, Senior!"</p><p>Huan Hen bowed deeply and quickly followed.</p><p>Watching them depart, Shen Chen sighed and turned to Li Yufu. “Is Master in seclusion? Are there any further instructions?”</p><p>Li Yufu nodded, his lips moving slightly, transmitting his message.</p><p>Shen Chen's expression grew solemn as he nodded repeatedly.</p><p>…</p><p>South of the Central Continent, slightly to the west, countless islands dotted the sea, inhabited by the Changyou Clan.</p><p>The islands were distributed in a pattern, some forming island chains. By deploying their forces along these chains, the Changyou Clan could establish formidable defensive lines.</p><p>In the past, ferocious beasts occasionally emerged from the Tainted Lands, but they appeared sporadically, usually alone, and wouldn't cause significant damage.  Nearby Changyou Clan cultivators could easily encircle and eliminate them.</p><p>Until the beast horde attack, which resulted in heavy casualties for the Changyou Clan. Later, with the discovery of the Storm Realm, the Changyou Clan stationed their main forces there.</p><p>The Storm Realm had launched several counterattacks, pushing the Changyou Clan back to this point, but they couldn't sustain their advance and would be driven back. The battlefield constantly shifted between the two territories. Now, the Changyou Clan had gained the upper hand and also occupied the Western Wasteland.</p><p>Beyond the first island chain, there were two more similar archipelagos where the Changyou Clan could retreat.  The strategic depth of the battlefield was something the Storm Realm couldn't match.</p><p>The clan members here had suffered countless casualties during the beast attacks, and after several centuries of recuperation, they were gradually recovering.</p><p>Beyond the three island chains lay a vast continent, the most prosperous and core territory of the Changyou Clan, where most of the prestigious families resided, along with the Ancestral Sacred Hall.</p><p>The Ancestral Sacred Hall was the most important sacred ground for every variant human clan. Inside, they venerated their ancestors, believing that only through devout worship would their ancestors guide them on the path of the Great Dao.</p><p>This continent was called Holybath Plain, named after a legend where the Changyou Clan ancestors had bathed in a sacred lake there.</p><p>Countless rivers and lakes crisscrossed the Holybath Plain, blessed with abundant rainfall. Almost sixty percent of its surface was water, with the rest consisting of swamps, wetlands, and rainforests. Truly dry land was scarce. The land was divided by waterways, resembling islands from above.</p><p>This was precisely the environment preferred by the Changyou Clan. They possessed innate water manipulation abilities, and even ordinary clan members were naturally drawn to water.</p><p>The sacred lake was the holiest site for the Changyou Clan, and the Ancestral Sacred Hall stood at its center.</p><p>The Changyou Clan Leader and the clan elders were responsible for guarding the Ancestral Sacred Hall and rarely left the sacred lake unless faced with significant matters.</p><p>The Clan Leader's residence was located on the shore of the sacred lake, and at this time, the Clan Leader was in seclusion.</p><p>Inside a quiet chamber, an oil lamp burned steadily.</p><p>The Changyou Clan Leader sat cross-legged beneath the lamp, inhaling the wisp of white smoke rising from the flame.</p><p>The lamp oil was a unique spiritual substance that emitted a calming fragrance when burned, aiding cultivation. It was a rare treasure even within the Changyou Clan, reserved only for the Clan Leader and elders.</p><p>The Zhuyan and their subordinate clans were known for their valor, strength, and powerful physiques, and the Changyou Clan was no exception. Most of their members were imposing and robust.</p><p>However, this Clan Leader was short and thin, only half the height of a normal Changyou Clan member. His cheeks were hollowed, accentuating his pointed features, while his four ears were unusually large, giving him a peculiar appearance.</p><p>During his meditation, the Clan Leader's ears twitched slightly, and he abruptly opened his eyes. The quiet chamber seemed to brighten momentarily.</p><p>The chamber's restrictions were activated from the outside.  The Clan Leader sensed it was his most valued third son. Before entering seclusion, he had given instructions that no one else should disturb him.</p><p>He frowned and demanded, “What is it?!”</p><p>"Father!"</p><p>The Clan Leader's son's voice was tinged with panic, as if he had encountered something terrifying. "Someone asked me to deliver this letter to you, saying they'll be waiting for you outside the sacred ground!"</p><p>The Changyou Clan Leader's eyes narrowed. His son also possessed Void Stage First Level cultivation. Who could make him so frightened that he would disregard his instructions and deliver the letter?</p><p>A crack opened silently in the chamber door.</p><p>The Clan Leader's son held a talisman letter with both hands. Suddenly, he felt his hands lighten as the talisman flew into the chamber.</p><p>The Changyou Clan Leader opened the talisman, glanced at it, and his expression changed drastically.</p><p>He slowly rose, his mind racing, his face shifting between various emotions. Finally, his expression returned to calmness. He walked out of the chamber and said to his third son, who stood respectfully, "Forget everything about this."</p><p>The Clan Leader’s son trembled. "Yes, Father!"</p>
