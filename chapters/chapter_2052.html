<h1>Chapter 2043: Outpost</h1><p>“Is this the territory of the Yi people?”</p><p>Qin Sang pointed towards the mist-shrouded sea.</p><p>Judging by its location, it lies northeast of Kanzhou, and right beside it.</p><p>Elder You looked over, quickly saying, “That’s right! The Yi people’s appearance is similar to humans, but they have lived in the mist-shrouded sea for many years, and are very proud, not close to either humans or demons. I’ve never been to the mist-shrouded sea; the map only roughly marks the location, and isn't precise.”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood, “The Yi people are so mysterious, Elder You hasn’t had any contact with them? I’ve heard rumors elsewhere that some believe the Yi people are actually a group of half-demons who luckily rose to power.”</p><p>“Half-demons are half-demons, and the Yi people are the Yi people; they cannot be confused. Both half-demons and the Yi people exist in Kanzhou, and I have had contact with both. Fellow Daoist, once you’ve seen them, you’ll know that half-demons cannot be compared to the Yi people at all.”</p><p>Elder You shook his head, showing considerable disdain for half-demons, “Half-demons are hybrids of human and demon bloodlines,  indeed some possess the advantages of both races, but most are the opposite, inheriting the flaws of both. Not only are they ugly in appearance, but the conflict between bloodlines is difficult to manage, easily leading to various congenital deficiencies; the more chaotic their ancestral bloodline, the more unbearable they are. The Yi people, however, are like us humans; they receive an education from a young age, knowing right from wrong, unlike demons who are brutal; some of their customs are even more refined than ours. Even if they are captured to become servants, no one looks down on them.”</p><p>“Servants?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>Elder You nodded, chuckling, “Just like capturing demons to sell as spirit beasts, there are also daring people who capture Yi people as slaves. Yi people servants are highly sought after in Kanzhou. They are excellent at guarding residences, managing mundane matters, and are quite impressive in front of guests. Some Yi people have innate special abilities, and after being subdued are even more useful than spirit beasts. Those from top clans are especially valuable, for instance, the Yu Ren royal family, who claim to be descendants of gods, are practically irreplaceable, even with spirit treasures.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, in such a borderland between different races, there’s inevitably a slave trade.</p><p>Humans can capture demons and Yi people, and those races can naturally enslave humans; in their eyes, human cultivators are also full of treasure.</p><p>The cycle continues, and resentment grows.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally thought that if the mist-shrouded sea was far from Kanzhou, and the Yi people and humans didn't interfere with each other, there would be no resentment between them, and the problems in the Storm World would be easier to solve. But if the two races have a deep-seated hatred, even he would be powerless.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang silent, gazing at the mist-shrouded sea, seemingly quite interested, Elder You misunderstood, saying, “Only a very small number of Kanzhou cultivators can get Yi people to follow them; at least, there is no openly selling of Yi people in the markets. In fact, even when cultivators capture powerful descendants of demon clans, they mostly conduct transactions privately, and don't publicly auction them within the state. If Elder Qin wants to buy servants, there are more opportunities in Lansha Prefecture.”</p><p>Lansha Prefecture refers to the vast sea area east of Wuming City, not one of the Eight Great Heavenly Prefectures, but rather a region named as such in imitation of Kanzhou.</p><p>According to Elder You, Lansha Prefecture has countless powerful forces, a mix of different races, numerous powerful individuals, and a complicated situation.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently, understanding that this must be a rule set by the upper echelons of Kanzhou to avoid stimulating the nerves of the Yi people and powerful demon clans, in order to maintain superficial peace.</p><p>Lansha Prefecture is a grey area tacitly permitted by various races, serving as a buffer zone for conflicts.</p><p>This also shows that Elder You’s map was indeed poorly drawn, Kanzhou and the mist-shrouded sea should be quite far apart. Otherwise, if they were too close, both sides would be limited to a small area, competing for cultivation resources, affecting their Dao and survival, inevitably leading to wars and killings. The slave trade would also flourish, and it wouldn't be something that could be easily controlled.</p><p>To go to the mist-shrouded sea, one must first understand the Yi people, and find a safe route there, and all of this can be found in Lansha Prefecture.</p><p>“The mist-shrouded sea is unique, there must be unique treasures produced there. Our human lands must also have treasures the Yi people need. Is there no contact between our Alliance and the Yi people?”</p><p>If possible, Qin Sang would rather approach the Yi people through the Five Elements Alliance, contacting those Yi people friendly to the Alliance. With years of established relationships, it would be easier to communicate, and then use this to investigate the Yi people internally.</p><p>Elder You's tone wavered, “It is said that the Yi people have merchant teams that come over every so often, but they only contact forces they recognize; our Alliance branch has not yet expanded beyond Kanzhou, and we send people to Lansha Prefecture to purchase these treasures. If Elder Qin needs anything, you can instruct the Alliance's stewards to find them.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood, knowing that this trading channel was one of the Five Elements Alliance's foundations, possibly involving many secrets. He was only a guest elder of the Alliance; the Alliance would not reveal such matters to him unless he truly joined them.</p><p>He tactfully stopped asking, “To be frank, Elder You, I’m indeed looking for materials to refine a treasure, and I'm still missing several.”</p><p>He produced a jade slip without ceremony and handed it to Elder You.</p><p>Elder You took it, examined it, raised an eyebrow, and said, "The treasure Elder Qin wishes to refine must be extraordinary!"</p><p>As an elder of the Five Elements League, he was also proficient in refining techniques, and he could discern the unusual nature of the materials from the list alone.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried about his secret being revealed.  The items listed on the jade slip were carefully selected, even a master refiner wouldn't be able to deduce their true purpose.</p><p>From the Bihen Essence from the Azure Sky Cave Heaven, to the deal with the forces of the Jade Lake, and then seeking help from the Five Elements League in Lian City before his departure—Qin Sang spared no expense, his years of accumulated wealth flowing away like water, yet he had already gathered most of the key materials needed for the Thunder Altar.</p><p>With the assistance of the Five Elements League in Kan Prefecture, and a trip to Lan Sha Prefecture, he expected to gather the rest without difficulty.</p><p>The remaining materials were for the construction of the altar and were commonly used, making them easy to acquire.  To avoid attracting attention, Lan Sha Prefecture was undoubtedly the best choice.</p><p>Realizing he needed to go to Lan Sha Prefecture as soon as possible, to gather information while acquiring the remaining materials, Qin Sang thought, "Forgive my boldness, Elder You.  Does our League have any of these rare items in its collection?"</p><p>Elder You stroked his chin, pondering, "The Misty Wind and Golden Vein Grass seeds, the League treasury seems to have those. As for the others, I can only try my best to gather information for Elder Qin. However, these two items might already be promised to someone, and I cannot make decisions on my own. I need to report upwards. Moreover, the value of these materials…"</p><p>"Thank you, Elder You!"</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and bowed respectfully. "For all the materials, I will ensure fair payment. I possess some wealth, and even if I deplete my savings, my skills alone should fetch a decent price."</p><p>Elder You smiled, "Elder Qin, you overestimate yourself.  Master refiners are respected everywhere; many would be eager to owe you favors. Please wait a few days, and I will make the necessary arrangements."</p><p>With that, Elder You was about to summon a servant to arrange a cave dwelling for Qin Sang within the League.</p><p>Qin Sang politely declined, visited a few more places to gather information, and then returned to his cave dwelling.</p><p>Su Nu and Gu Ya had already returned from their shopping trip and were waiting for Qin Sang in the main hall, playing with the novel items they had bought.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang return, Gu Ya quickly put down a spirit-jade carved artifact, and rose to greet him.</p><p>After hearing about their experiences in the city, Qin Sang asked Gu Ya, "Did you see anyone from the Heterogeneous Race?"</p><p>Gu Ya was startled and glanced at Su Nu.  Knowing the significance of the Storm World, she had always been tight-lipped in front of Su Nu.</p><p>"No," Gu Ya whispered, uncertain of Qin Sang's intentions and unwilling to say more.</p><p>"You may leave. I have something important to discuss with Fellow Daoist Su Nu," said Qin Sang.</p><p>Gu Ya responded with a bow and withdrew.</p><p>Su Nu watched with a smile, and once Gu Ya left, she teased, "What unspeakable secret are you about to reveal to your little sister, Brother Qin?"</p><p>"It's a great secret, and extremely important.  Don't blame me for being cautious, but you must swear an oath to keep it secret, even from your master, before I can tell you."  Qin Sang said solemnly.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's serious expression, Su Nu dropped her playful demeanor and said gravely, "Does it concern your safety, Brother Qin? If so, I'd rather not know."</p><p>"It does concern our safety, and it relates to where we will go next. Unless you stay in Kan Prefecture, you will inevitably find out once we arrive at our destination," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Intrigued, Su Nu immediately made a karmic oath, promising absolute secrecy.</p><p>With Su Nu's oath taken, Qin Sang softly said, "It starts with your and the Seven Kills Hall's ascension through the boundary. Since then, the Storm World has become increasingly unusual…"</p><p>In the quiet hall, Qin Sang slowly recounted his findings, carefully selecting what to reveal to Su Nu based on what he learned from Gu Ya.</p><p>Even considering her own hidden circumstances, Su Nu was greatly shocked by what she heard.</p><p>"The Storm World is ascending into the Greater Thousand World!"</p><p>Su Nu's eyes widened, even her master and the White General did not know about this.</p><p>With her intelligence, she had noticed Gu Ya's behavior, and Qin Sang's caution hinted at something.  She suspected Qin Sang had found the gateway to the Storm World, but never imagined the entire world's ascension!</p><p>"Could a Lesser Thousand World integrate into the Greater Thousand World, causing its expansion? Or was the Storm World always part of the Greater Thousand World?"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Nu's reaction was similar to Qin Sang's.</p><p>This speculation stemmed from the Storm World's extraordinary nature. Otherwise, why would the Purple Micro Palace have chosen it?</p><p>Now she understood Qin Sang's caution. Once the news leaked, countless individuals would seek the lost treasures of the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>"I've considered that," Qin Sang said, shaking her head slightly, "but the matters of the Boundary are beyond our comprehension.  The situation in Storm World is unknown; lost in the Mist Sea for centuries, surrounded by alien races, its survival is uncertain.  There's no point in worrying too much."</p><p>Su Nu quickly composed herself.  "Brother Qin is right. Before Storm World ascended, late-stage Yuan Ying cultivators were top-tier powerhouses. How can they withstand the powerful clans of the Great Thousand World? We must first find them before we can plan for the future. So, Brother Qin intends to establish a Daoist sanctuary in Storm World, gathering these spiritual materials to refine treasures to protect it?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "Exactly. I will go there personally. If you don't wish to return, remaining in Kan Prefecture can still be of assistance to me."</p><p>Su Nu smiled gently. "Does Brother Qin think I'm someone who fears hardship and difficulty? Oh..."</p><p>She suddenly realized Qin Sang's intentions.  "Thank you, Brother Qin, for your consideration!  Those who controlled me back then have all perished in the Seven Killing Hall, the Three Great Merchant Alliances are gone, and I've dealt with the remaining enemies after my cultivation improved.  Brother Qin saved my life, and the Four Saints Palace treated me well.  I have only good memories. Why would I harbor resentment towards Storm World? As a cultivator from Storm World, regardless of other reasons, because of this karmic connection, I should go."</p><p>Hearing Su Nu's words, Qin Sang felt relieved.  He nodded. "You're right. Even if Storm World can't defeat the alien races, as long as they haven't been completely annihilated, there's still hope. Since we come from the same world, we have a responsibility to bring them out."</p><p>Those cultivators who can completely sever their ties are few and far between. Even if Qin Sang always acted like a detached observer, he couldn't ignore trouble for Qingyang Palace.</p><p>"I absolutely must secure a place in Brother Qin's sanctuary!" Su Nu said with a playful smile, then fell into thought.  "Once we locate Storm World, there's another difficulty. The Mist Sea is occupied by the alien races. If they don't allow us humans entry, we'll have to disguise ourselves."</p><p>"We can inquire in Lan Sha Prefecture."</p><p>Qin Sang already had a plan.  Since Su Nu agreed to go, he laid it out.</p><p>"Unlike other Heavenly Prefectures, the immortal cities on the border of Kan Prefecture have large teleportation arrays. You should go to Wumian City.  It shouldn't take long to arrive.  Establish a base there, it may be useful later. At the same time, investigate the situation in Lan Sha Prefecture and try to contact its powers..."</p><p>Su Nu understood the implication.  "Brother Qin isn't coming with us?"</p><p>"I haven't gathered all the materials yet, and I need the Five Elements Alliance's help.  But those treasures aren't easy to obtain; I might be employed by them for a while.  It's not necessarily a bad thing; Kan and Lan Sha Prefectures are surely intertwined. You operate externally, I internally, and we should see results soon," Qin Sang said confidently.</p><p>Su Nu was meticulous; these tasks could be safely entrusted to her. With her assistance, Qin Sang felt much more at ease.</p><p>The two discussed their plans in the main hall for a long time, Qin Sang outlining his strategy, Su Nu adding her suggestions.  Then they set about their respective tasks, aiming for swift preparation.</p><p>Qin Sang activated a restriction to summon Gu Ya, informing her that Su Nu was also a senior cultivator who ascended from Storm World.</p><p>Gu Ya was both surprised and delighted. She had been slightly wary of Su Nu, but now knowing they came from the same lower realm, her apprehension disappeared, and their relationship became much closer.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to awaken Jian Nu as well; the situation in Lan Sha Prefecture was uncertain, and more help was always better.</p><p>Su Nu stopped him.  "Let him stay. Brother Qin will be dealing with the Five Elements Alliance. You need someone reliable by your side; you can't do everything yourself, or you'll lose face among your peers."</p><p>Qin Sang considered this and agreed.</p><p>Time was of the essence. Su Nu and Gu Ya stayed three more days before departing.</p><p>After seeing them off, Qin Sang went to the Five Elements Alliance at the appointed time to visit Elder You.</p>
