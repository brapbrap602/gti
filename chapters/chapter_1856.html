<h1>Chapter 1847: The Vajra Bodhi Tree</h1><p>The tremors in the arena continued unabated, growing stronger.</p><p>The shaking even reached beyond the arena, causing the ground to tremble and the vegetation to sway.  A commotion erupted in both armies; cultivators and demon cultivators alike turned their gazes towards the arena.</p><p>Amidst swirling auspicious clouds, an unmistakable golden light ascended. Gradually, the multicolored clouds were almost entirely dyed gold.</p><p>This phenomenon had occurred countless times in recent days, but this time was clearly different.</p><p>The scale and intensity of the golden light were unprecedented, leading some to fear that the auspicious clouds surrounding the arena might be shattered, revealing the arena’s true form.</p><p>Everyone sensed an impending change and their expressions tightened.</p><p>In the rear of both armies, at the source of the celestial phenomenon, the Demon King and the Grand Masters simultaneously flew to higher ground, their gazes fixed on the arena, their faces grave.</p><p>Even with their keen eyesight and supernatural abilities, they couldn't penetrate the thick auspicious clouds to see what was truly happening within the arena.</p><p>The origin of the auspicious clouds was unknown; they were certainly not ordinary clouds, likely connected to the former arena's great array or the lingering power of a great cultivator, existing since time immemorial.</p><p>They could only remain outside the arena, patiently awaiting the outcome, hoping it wouldn't collapse.  If it did, it would likely take hundreds, even thousands of years to stabilize again.</p><p>The cultivators and demon cultivators inside the arena had a clearer view.</p><p>The blinding golden light formed waves of radiant energy, sweeping across every corner of the arena. It was evident that there were nine sources of this light, one large and eight small, corresponding to the nine primordial fetuses brought by the demon cultivators.</p><p>After the appearance of the ancient tree, a tenth light source emerged, like ten golden suns illuminating the arena.</p><p>Moreover, the golden light emanating from the ancient tree was even more dazzling and vast than that of the nine primordial fetuses!</p><p>The tree's shadow swayed.</p><p>The ancient tree seemed to have grown out of nowhere, rising from the ground, appearing amidst the golden light.</p><p>All eyes were drawn to it, a mixture of shock, bewilderment, and greed!</p><p>Regardless of their expressions, the demon cultivators all displayed a degree of confusion; the tree's appearance was entirely unexpected.</p><p>Following the Great Saint's orders, they had successfully set up the primordial fetus array, aiming to pinpoint the approximate location of the Divine Court.</p><p>Everything had gone smoothly.</p><p>The array was complete, and the power of the primordial fetuses converged on a specific area, where the Divine Court was most likely hidden.</p><p>The Celestial Court hadn't deciphered their true intentions, acting like headless flies, distracted by the repeatedly erupting golden light, their formations scattered.  The demon cultivators, with their pre-planned strategy, were poised to gain the upper hand.</p><p>The appearance of the tree was an accident.</p><p>This tree wasn't located within the area targeted by the primordial fetus array; it should have been unrelated to the Divine Court.  It seemed the golden light's impact on a certain illusion had revealed the tree, previously hidden and unknown, within the illusion.</p><p>But the tree's impact was immense.</p><p>At this moment, every cultivator within the arena, regardless of how many layers of illusion separated them, could see the gradually solidifying tree shadow.</p><p>The tree's roots were unseen; only its shadow was clear.</p><p>The tree didn't seem to be an illusory phantom. Cultivators closer could see its massive trunk, its gnarled roots, its strong branches, the distinct veins on its leaves, and the fruit hidden amongst them.</p><p>The entire tree was golden, radiating an ancient aura that filled one with awe.</p><p>It was undoubtedly an ancient tree, perhaps thousands or tens of thousands of years old, hidden within the arena, unknown to anyone.</p><p>Its leaves were like golden leaves, densely packed across the entire tree, forming a shimmering golden canopy.</p><p>Unlike its lush foliage, the tree bore very few fruits.  These were oval-shaped, plump, golden, and adorned with strange patterns.</p><p>Initially captivated by this unique ancient tree, the more knowledgeable among them focused their attention on its fruit, their minds recalling ancient texts and secrets, their expressions turning to astonishment.</p><p>“Could this be…?”</p><p>…</p><p>“The Vajra Bodhi Tree?”</p><p>Qin Sang, hidden amongst the flower fields, could also sense the primordial fetus array and see the golden tree.</p><p>His eyes gleamed, completely ignoring the array, his gaze fixed on the tree, numerous memories surging within his mind.</p><p>The Vajra Bodhi Tree, a legendary celestial spirit root, incredibly rare. The tree itself held no particular significance; its value lay in its fruit, imbued with the essence of heaven and earth, the culmination of the tree's life force.</p><p>The fruit of the Vajra Bodhi Tree, known as Vajra Fruit, ranked among the ten greatest divine trees!</p><p>“Vajra Fruit, it’s actually Vajra Fruit!”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, he wasn't unfamiliar with the Vajra Fruit.  A long time ago, a Vajra Fruit had appeared in the Xiaohan region, triggering a great upheaval that resulted in the destruction of the Blood Nether Sect, a major demonic sect, at the hands of the Pure Yang Sect.</p><p>Afterwards, Jin Gangshi was taken away by a disciple of the Blood God Sect, and his whereabouts remain unknown.  The Pure Yang Sect searched for him extensively without success, and Qin Sang even instructed Li Yu Fu and others to look for him during their desert travels, all to no avail.</p><p>Because of this Jin Gangshi, Qin Sang was familiar with this divine tree and recognized its origin at a glance.</p><p>The Jin Gangshi that appeared in Xiao Han Domain years ago was only one, but here stood a Jin Gang Bodhi tree!</p><p>It is said that it takes an extremely long time for a Jin Gangshi to grow to maturity, and a Jin Gang Bodhi tree only bears fruit once in its lifetime, but it doesn't bear just one fruit.</p><p>The moment the Jin Gangshi ripens, the life force of the tree is depleted, though it's not noticeable to the naked eye.</p><p>Qin Sang widened his eyes and counted carefully.  There were at least three or four visible to the naked eye, and considering those hidden among the leaves and on the back of the ancient tree, there were probably over a dozen, all ripe!</p><p>"嘶…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted, never expecting to find Jin Gangshi here and now.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang had already decided to close the mountain and avoid outside affairs, how could he remain still?  Faced with a tree full of Jin Gangshi, few in the world could remain calm.</p><p>Moreover, his life-bound spirit sword could absorb and enhance itself with spiritual wood, and the Ten Divine Trees were the most precious spiritual wood.</p><p>"Is this what the Dao Court and Gui Fang Kingdom are vying for—these Jin Gangshi?"</p><p>This thought flashed through his mind.</p><p>"Something doesn't seem right…"</p><p>Qin Sang had a sudden insight, remembering the Yuan Tai Formation. He turned his head towards another direction, his eyes narrowed as he carefully sensed.</p><p>The fluctuations of golden light, the flow of the formation's spiritual energy…</p><p>Qin Sang could only vaguely perceive some things, but he could confirm that the spiritual energy of the formation was converging on a different area, seemingly unrelated to the Jin Gang Bodhi tree, and the two were not closely connected.</p><p>Though unsure of the Yuan Tai Formation's purpose, Qin Sang could vaguely guess.</p><p>"If the Dao Court and Gui Fang Kingdom are using this formation to search for something, they should have directly targeted the Jin Gang Bodhi tree. Why is the spiritual energy shifting?  Could it be an accident?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>Another reason: Qin Sang didn't believe that a few Jin Gangshi were worth such a large-scale military campaign by the Dao Court and Gui Fang Kingdom.</p><p>Qin Sang believed that, with the resources of the Dao Court and Gui Fang Kingdom, they certainly wouldn't lack treasures comparable to, or even exceeding, the Jin Gangshi.</p><p>The Ten Divine Trees, though famous, were just ten types of spiritual wood.</p><p>Since arriving in this world, Qin Sang had successively sought instruction in weapon refinement from Master Qi and Master Gu, diligently collecting weapon refinement texts from this world, and had made considerable gains.</p><p>At the same time, he had been paying close attention to various spiritual woods, and discovered that this world also had a legend of the Ten Divine Trees.</p><p>In one ancient book, Qin Sang saw some speculations written by an unknown senior cultivator.</p><p>This senior cultivator believed that being included among the Ten Divine Trees didn't necessarily mean that these ten types of divine trees were the most precious spiritual wood in the heavens and earth.</p><p>The heavens and earth are vast, and the number of spiritual woods is countless, like the stars in the sky. Why were these ten specifically chosen?</p><p>The names of spiritual wood are given by cultivators, and the so-called ranking must also come from cultivators.</p><p>There must be a reason why ten divine trees were selected from among the countless spiritual woods, becoming widely known and accepted.</p><p>Firstly, the spiritual wood is rare; rarity increases value.</p><p>Secondly, the spiritual wood itself is extraordinary, possessing unique abilities or characteristics, such as the Soul-Nourishing Wood.</p><p>With the Bai Ji Hun Soul-Nourishing Wood, a residual soul can survive countless years, awaiting rebirth.</p><p>Or, there's a widely circulated story related to the spiritual wood, a tale that is fondly told and remembered, ensuring its renown.</p><p>The story might involve a great catastrophe, a dramatic love-hate saga, or even the fact that the spiritual wood was refined into a stunning treasure, thus gaining fame.</p><p>The senior cultivator cited an example: the Qing Fu Zheng Bamboo, the true form of Yun You Zi.</p><p>The book states that there is a legendary divine seal, called the Qing Fu Zheng Divine Seal, said to be one of the supreme divine seals of the Daoist sect, containing boundless power.</p><p>The names of the Qing Fu Zheng Divine Seal and the Qing Fu Zheng Bamboo are exactly the same. Legend has it that the seal was made from the entire Qing Fu Zheng Bamboo.</p><p>The Daoist sect wouldn't name such a top-tier seal casually.</p><p>He speculated that the name of the Qing Fu Zheng Bamboo was related to the seal; it might not have been its original name, but rather it was named after the seal, and thus became one of the Ten Divine Trees.</p><p>Legends are hard to verify, and the seal is now lost, but this illustrates a point.</p><p>Because of the record in this book, Qin Sang further suspected the origins of this world.</p><p>That the divine wood got its name from a Dao Court seal, yet spread to other lesser thousand worlds, this is something that small sects confined to one world could never accomplish.</p><p>This world, the Dao Court… so many secrets!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have the energy to delve into these matters at the moment. He was weighing the consequences of his involvement in the struggle.</p><p>The Dao Court and Gui Fang Kingdom would only mobilize a large army for a few Jin Gangshi if they needed them to refine some kind of supreme treasure.</p><p>If the goal of the Dao Court and Gui Fang Kingdom wasn't the Jin Gang Bodhi tree, then there would be no problem.</p><p>The Yuan Tai Formation and the Jin Gang Bodhi tree appeared almost simultaneously. The other party wouldn't ignore the real target, delaying important matters; at most, they would only send some people to contend for the Jin Gangshi.</p><p>Qin Sang had a good chance.</p><p>If they truly sought the King Kong Fruits, Qin Sang could fish in troubled waters while they fought amongst themselves.  As long as Qin Sang wasn't greedy and stopped after obtaining one or two fruits, she shouldn't attract a relentless pursuit.</p><p>The pros and cons were weighed in a flash.  Qin Sang deemed it feasible, her gaze sweeping across the flower field, making an immediate decision to act!</p><p>The White Bone Earth's foundation was solid; the flower field showed no sign of collapse, leaving her without worries. If there was only one King Kong Fruit, Qin Sang would have hesitated, but in this situation, missing this opportunity would leave her deeply regretful.</p><p>This thought had barely crossed her mind when a change occurred. As the King Kong Bodhi Tree solidified, it was almost entirely revealed to everyone present. It resembled a towering ancient tree growing in the altar.</p><p>But just as everyone wanted to observe the tree closely to determine if it was real or an illusion, they saw the leaves on the outside of the tree shimmer with golden light, like golden flames, instantly igniting the entire tree.</p><p>The Yuan Tai Formation reached its peak and then waned, the golden light beginning to recede. The tree's flames soared, completely overshadowing the Yuan Tai Formation.  It seemed as if the entire tree was burning; the flames spread to the roots. As the flames spread, the tree became ethereal again.</p><p>It was unclear whether it would be burned to ashes or would vanish again; the tree's shadow grew fainter and fainter. Once the tree disappeared, finding it again would be extremely difficult, unless a Great Sage intervened and refined another Yuan Tai Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.  Without hesitation, she leaped out of the flower field's space, quickly casting several hand seals to completely seal the flower field formation.  Glancing at the tree's phantom, Qin Sang activated her lightning escape technique, resolutely charging into the still-unstable illusion.</p><p>Even if everyone else failed to obtain the King Kong Fruits, Qin Sang would race against time before the tree vanished, locate the tree's growing area, and search for it later.</p><p>Unlike Qin Sang, the other cultivators and demon cultivators in the altar watched the gradually fading tree shadow and the area indicated by the Yuan Tai Formation's spiritual energy. The two locations didn't seem far apart, but they were all caught in a difficult decision.</p><p>The King Kong Fruits were precious; a whole tree full was incredibly tempting.  However, they bore a more important mission, one concerning survival. In the eyes of most demon kings and Grand Masters, the King Kong Fruits were mere trifles, how could they compare to the Divine Court?</p><p>Ruoquan Zhenren and his group recognized the King Kong Fruits. The Grand Master who cultivated the Golden Seal Altar and forged the Jade Bamboo Staff stared at the tree, unable to tear his eyes away. He cultivated the Golden Seal Altar, its creation requiring wood-attribute spiritual objects, spiritual wood being the best. He had never seen the ten divine trees in his lifetime.</p><p>"Don't be deceived by the demons' tricks!" Ruoquan Zhenren exclaimed softly, glancing at the Grand Master intentionally or unintentionally.</p><p>The Grand Master, as if struck by a thunderbolt, instantly regained clarity, awakening from his greed.  The King Kong Fruits might not be real; it could be a trap set by the demons to unsettle their minds.</p><p>The Grand Master took a deep breath, resolutely withdrawing his gaze. Seeing Ruoquan Zhenren and others gradually moving away, he swiftly followed them.</p><p>Elsewhere, Wan Zhenren and others were similarly drawn to the King Kong Bodhi Tree, mostly out of love for the rare treasure; none were as urgent as the other Grand Master.</p><p>The old Taoist lightly raised his whisk, chuckling, "Let's wait until the important matter is settled before searching for that spiritual tree. At that time, I'll accompany all of you; any King Kong Fruits obtained will be given to you."</p><p>Pausing, the old Taoist glanced towards the tree, his eyes meaningful, saying, "There should be other cultivators in that direction.  When we go to meet them, we might pass by the tree, conveniently picking a few fruits. If there are any left over, should any of you urgently need them, I will shamelessly ask for one or two."</p><p>Upon hearing this, even Wan Zhenren's eyes lit up. They all bowed their heads in gratitude, their minds at ease.</p><p>The old Taoist smiled and nodded, tapping the place where the Yuan Tai Formation's spiritual energy converged with his whisk. "The important matter is paramount; don't be distracted. Once this is done, the Daoist sect and the Celestial Court's rewards will be far superior to the King Kong Fruits."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The Grand Masters' morale soared, no longer paying attention to the tree, and followed the old Taoist as they sped away.</p><p>Similar scenarios played out elsewhere. Whether Daoist Grand Masters or demon kings and demon lords, the vast majority would not be swayed by the King Kong Fruits. Those who could cultivate to their level were well aware of the pros and cons and would not sacrifice the greater for the lesser.</p><p>However, there were always exceptions. Especially those closer to the tree's location; by slightly altering their direction of travel, they could obtain the legendary ten divine trees without losing much time—why not? (End)</p>
