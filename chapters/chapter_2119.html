<h1>Chapter 2109:  Ephemeral Profound Divine Light</h1><p>Qin Sang left the Western Lands and arrived at a deserted stretch of ocean. He laid down formations and restrictions, then sat cross-legged in meditation.</p><p>Man and butterfly, their minds linked as one. Sensing the urgency in Tianmu Die's thoughts, Qin Sang immediately circulated a secret technique, assisting Tianmu Die in breaking through her bottleneck.</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>In the tranquil night, a lone figure sat, suddenly shimmering with a faint fluorescence. A phoenix butterfly appeared, fluttering up and down.</p><p>The surrounding spiritual energy stirred, rising and falling with the beat of the butterfly's wings.  With each surge, more and more spiritual energy was drawn in, forming a visible spiritual tide that roared above the ocean.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt a shift and immediately activated his secret art with full force. Tianmu Die soared, wings vibrating, and plunged into the immense spiritual tide.</p><p>Within the surging, turbulent tide, Tianmu Die appeared small and insignificant, yet she was fearless, cleaving through wind and waves, charging towards the depths.</p><p>Dazzling spiritual light bloomed on her wings. Tianmu Die stretched gracefully, her beauty breathtaking. Then, with her wings as the center, a swirling vortex of spiritual energy was born, relentlessly devouring the surrounding spiritual tide.</p><p>Qin Sang maintained his connection with Tianmu Die, while simultaneously diverting a portion of his mind to protect her.</p><p>At the heart of the spiritual tide, amidst the magnificent spectacle, the phoenix butterfly's form flickered in and out of existence.</p><p>When the celestial phenomena reached their peak intensity, Qin Sang gently awoke, gazing up at the heavens.  At the same time, the spiritual tide abruptly subsided. Under the calm night sky, a beautiful phoenix butterfly danced in a spiral, conveying feelings of joy and accomplishment.</p><p>Breaking through a minor realm wouldn't trigger a qualitative change. What Qin Sang truly focused on was the evolution of Tianmu Die's divine abilities.</p><p>He raised his hand, and Tianmu Die landed on his fingertip, her wings ceasing their motion.  Her celestial eyes shimmered with an unusual brilliance. Immediately after, Qin Sang felt a gentle wave spreading from Tianmu Die.</p><p>In the next moment, both their figures flickered, reappearing a hundred zhang away.</p><p>A contemplative expression appeared on Qin Sang's face. Recalling the sensation he had just experienced, he was certain this wasn't teleportation. He could clearly feel a process occurring between the two locations.</p><p>In the instant Tianmu Die activated her divine ability, they seemed to enter a peculiar state, existing in a manner incomprehensible to ordinary mortals.</p><p>This feeling was difficult to describe with words. It was as if Tianmu Die had drawn them into nothingness, or perhaps pulled them into a strange dimension.  Of course, this description was somewhat exaggerated. Tianmu Die wasn't that powerful yet. Perhaps as her cultivation continued to rise, she would eventually grasp such an ability, but not now.</p><p>When Tianmu Die activated her divine ability, Qin Sang vaguely sensed a faint, peculiar radiance, as though enveloped by a layer of divine light. This transformation was clearly related to it.</p><p>“This divine ability might as well be called Ephemeral Profound Divine Light,” Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Ephemeral Profound, signifying an illusory and profound meaning.</p><p>Qin Sang still couldn't comprehend the true mysteries of the Ephemeral Profound Divine Light, but this name seemed fitting.</p><p>Aside from breaking and traversing formation restrictions and seals, he had yet to uncover other applications of the Ephemeral Profound Divine Light.</p><p>This was the most profound divine ability Tianmu Die had comprehended since he subdued her. He recalled that in the past, every divine ability Tianmu Die had grasped possessed mystical powers that surpassed her current realm in certain aspects.  Could the Ephemeral Profound Divine Light be similar, already touching upon the fringes of the Soul Integration stage, explaining why it was so difficult to understand?</p><p>With ordinary spirit insects, Qin Sang wouldn't dare entertain such a notion, but Tianmu Die could devour tribulation lightning.</p><p>To a certain extent, tribulation lightning represented the will of Heaven and Earth!</p><p>Next, Qin Sang had Tianmu Die use the ability several more times, but he still couldn't make heads or tails of it. He then summoned his flying light and returned to the Western Lands.</p><p>…</p><p>After Tianmu Die's breakthrough, Qin Sang continued to preside over the branch altar while also researching the Ephemeral Profound Divine Light.</p><p>One day, the restrictions outside the altar were triggered. Qin Sang awoke from his meditation and swept his divine sense outward.  He saw Bao Xi delivering a message talisman. It turned out Yuan Miao had come to visit.</p><p>“Good news or bad news, I wonder…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then appeared outside the altar a moment later.</p><p>Yuan Miao was currently at the Great Compassion Monastery.  Qin Sang arrived, flying through the air. The high monks of the Great Compassion Monastery were already waiting at the temple gates, leading him into the main hall.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Yuan Miao immediately asked, “Fellow Daoist Qin, has Clan Leader Min Zhuo made any unusual moves recently?”</p><p>“This poor Daoist has been in secluded cultivation recently and hasn't received any such intelligence. Fellow Daoist Yuan must have had a fruitful journey, I presume?”</p><p>Qin Sang observed Yuan Miao, seeing he looked travel-worn, but his expression was rather relaxed.</p><p>Yuan Miao grinned.  “This old man personally inquired with Clan Leader Zai Zhen. Last time, he was assisting Clan Leader Min Zhuo, fighting against Fellow Daoist. There was a reason for that.  Among the ancestors of the Yonghe and Changyou Clans, there was a generation of clan leaders who had a deep friendship. The Yonghe Clan owed the Changyou Clan a favor.  This time, when Clan Leader Min Zhuo requested help, Clan Leader Zai Zhen had to agree, out of obligation.”</p><p>“So that's how it is,” Qin Sang nodded, sighing, “Unexpectedly, even a small clan like the Changyou Clan has deep roots.”</p><p>Yuan Miao chuckled. “Even they themselves might not be able to fully explain the connections between various clans.  Perhaps some small clan has a Sage Realm expert backing them, but they've been cultivating in the Sacred Lands all along, unknown to the world.”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. “The division between Upper Clans and Royal Clans, isn't it based on the will of Ancestral Realm and Sage Realm experts?”</p><p>Yuan Miao shook his head. “Unless their homes are destroyed and clans exterminated, those experts won't interfere. Rise and fall are the laws of the Heavenly Dao. As long as the bloodline continues, there will always be a day of resurgence.  The difference between Upper Clans and Royal Clans only depends on their power outside the Sacred Lands.  For example, my Zhuyan Clan, if one day we are defeated, the experts of our clan won't intervene.  We wouldn't have the face to ask for help either. We would have to diligently cultivate ourselves and reclaim our position in the future!”</p><p>“So that's how it is…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>Yuan Miao thought Qin Sang was still worried, and added, “After asking Clan Leader Zai Zhen, this old man visited another expert. He also agreed to help Clan Leader Min Zhuo due to similar reasons. He had no personal grudge against Fellow Daoist. After witnessing your strength, he didn't wish to offend you, so he concealed his identity.  With this, Fellow Daoist shouldn’t need to worry anymore.”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  “Fellow Daoist Yuan means…”</p><p>In fact, from the moment Yuan Miao, representing the Zhuyan Clan, acknowledged Storm Realm, their situation had drastically changed from before.</p><p>With the Zhuyan Clan's recognition, other Royal Clans couldn’t use the pretext of expelling outsiders to attack them.  Just relying on the Changyou Clan, how many treasures could they possibly offer to invite those experts out of seclusion?</p><p>Yuan Miao nodded.  “They’ve already repaid their favor last time. They won’t intervene again!  The Changyou Clan's foundation is ultimately shallow.  Clan Leader Min Zhuo might be able to invite experts to protect the Changyou Clan, but to have them fight to the death with Fellow Daoist, they might not be willing.”</p><p>Then, Yuan Miao's tone became slightly grave.  “This old man is telling Fellow Daoist this to reassure you. It’s not for Fellow Daoist to cast aside all caution and launch a large-scale attack on the Changyou Clan!”</p><p>Qin Sang understood his meaning and said seriously, “We only seek to establish ourselves in the Mist Sea. We’ve never aspired to annihilate the Changyou Clan.”</p><p>As long as the Sacred Lake Formation existed, the Changyou Clan's bloodline wouldn't be severed.</p><p>“That's good!”</p><p>Yuan Miao's expression relaxed. “This old man has been out for so long, I can finally return and report!  Fellow Daoist Qin, until we meet again.  This old man will come and bother you again in the future!”</p><p>Yuan Miao was decisive and left immediately.</p><p>“Farewell, Fellow Daoist!”</p><p>Qin Sang saw him off to the temple gates, watching Yuan Miao depart. He then returned to the branch altar and continued comprehending his divine ability.</p><p>After nearly a thousand years, the Western Lands finally welcomed a rare period of peace.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s confidence in the altars, after careful consideration, Master Huaiyin ordered the monks of the Western Lands to enter the mortal world, leading ordinary people back to the desert to cultivate oases and restore human activity in the desert.</p><p>Altars appeared throughout the desert, forming a grand altar formation, resembling a vast woven net.</p><p>The oases they chose were all within this net. As long as the altar formation wasn't destroyed, they would be safe.</p><p>Teams of ordinary people appeared in the desert, often entire families migrating together. Led by one or several monks, they braved the elements, enduring hardships to find their ideal homeland.</p><p>Vast stretches of yellow sand.</p><p>On a sand dune, a string of footprints was clearly visible. The other side of the dune offered shade, and the migrating group stopped there to avoid the midday sun.  Camels and horses formed a large circle, pulling up canvas covers, providing immediate relief from the heat.</p><p>Several families were migrating together. Three monks sat in the center of the group.  Even in the scorching desert, they could still meditate peacefully, without a single drop of sweat.</p><p>“There’s a person over there!”</p><p>A boy with sharp eyes suddenly shouted, pointing into the distance. Everyone looked, and after a while, they confirmed there was indeed a person walking on a sand dune.</p><p>Everyone was amazed.  Even with so many people traveling together, with ample water and food, and a large number of camels and horses, they still found the journey arduous.</p><p>That person seemed to have no luggage and was traveling alone in the desert. How could they survive?</p><p>Just then, someone gasped, suspecting they were seeing things.  They rubbed their eyes vigorously and cried out, “That person is so fast!”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the figure had crossed a sand dune.</p><p>At this moment, the three monks emerged from their meditation, gazing at the approaching figure with grave expressions.  They exchanged glances, and just as they were about to activate their magical treasures, they felt a sudden daze, their consciousness becoming muddled.</p><p>A bizarre scene unfolded among the crowd. Everyone stared blankly in the direction of the approaching figure, their faces vacant.</p><p>The newcomer had somehow arrived near the group.</p><p>Dressed in white, he had an androgynous aura.  His limbs and features were indistinguishable from a human's, except for his excessively handsome appearance.  The only difference was a peculiar round bead embedded in his forehead.</p><p>He looked at one of the monks, and the monk involuntarily met his gaze, as if bewitched.  Without needing to be asked, the monk revealed everything he knew.</p><p>Then the second, and the third.  By the time the three monks had finished, the man in white had passed through the crowd, disappearing on the other side of the sand dune.</p><p>After the man in white left, the crowd returned to normal, and the three monks, unaware of anything amiss, continued their chanting.</p><p>In the desert, countless sand dunes rose and fell like waves.</p><p>The man in white walked on the dunes, gazing eastward, muttering to himself, “After asking so many people, they all give the same story. That Grand True Man Qin is quite tight-lipped. It seems that if I want to know what kind of altar it is, I must go and investigate personally.”</p><p>He had never seen a Daoist altar, but he knew that such formations must have primary and secondary components.  Coming here alone, investigating the main altar was too risky.  It would be better to choose a branch altar and proceed gradually.</p><p>Furthermore, he suspected this altar formation contained many deceptive elements, designed to confuse enemies and cloud their judgment.</p><p>After pondering for a long time, the man in white retracted his gaze and turned south.</p><p>Soon after, he arrived in the south, appearing atop a sand dune, overlooking the scene below.</p><p>Below the dune was an oasis, and within the oasis was a Buddhist temple, heavily fortified with layers of restrictions.</p><p>Within this temple was an altar, an unfinished one.</p><p>The man in white believed that a completed altar would certainly be connected to the main altar.  Tampering with it would easily be detected by the altar's master.  An unfinished altar would be easier to investigate.</p><p>He walked towards the temple, arriving at the temple gates.  The gates opened silently and then closed slowly, unnoticed by the monks inside.</p><p>The man in white entered the temple, passing through doorways and corridors without alerting anyone. The temple's formations and restrictions were as if nonexistent to him.</p><p>Finally, he arrived at the temple's backyard.  In the courtyard was a deep well, where most of the monks were gathered, sitting cross-legged around the well, chanting scriptures.</p><p>Waves of energy emanated from the well, concealed by the temple's restrictions.</p><p>The man in white stood at the entrance, observing with interest.</p><p>After a while, the monks stopped to regulate their breathing, and the fluctuations from the well disappeared. The man in white extended a five-colored snake from his sleeve.  It opened its mouth and exhaled a breath of snake venom into the courtyard.</p><p>The venom was colorless and odorless.  Soon, snoring filled the air.</p><p>The man in white strolled in, peering down into the well.  He saw an altar at the bottom, with an old monk sitting cross-legged upon it, also asleep.</p><p>A gentle breeze entered the well, lifting the old monk out.  The man in white then appeared on the altar.</p><p>His gaze swept over the altar.  The man in white thought to himself, "Interesting…"</p><p>This altar's design was unlike anything he had ever seen. He would ask the Grand Offering when he returned; perhaps he would know.</p><p>"I wonder where that wretch found such helpers?"</p><p>The man in white murmured, his eyes falling upon a 'gap' in the altar where the restrictions were yet to be fully inscribed.</p><p>He had already learned the content of these restrictions from the old monk, but he needed to interact with the altar to understand their true power.</p><p>He didn't act rashly. A shadow emerged behind him, resembling a strange spirit bird.  The shadow clung tightly to him as his eyes began to change, becoming like a pair of bird pupils.</p><p>The bird pupils flickered with a dark light as the man in white focused on the altar, invisible waves spreading outwards.  Just as he was about to investigate further, he suddenly frowned.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang, meditating at the branch altar, was startled awake.  A cold glint flashed in his eyes, and his figure flickered, vanishing into thin air.</p><p>The man in white's frown deepened. He had just experienced a sudden premonition of danger, a surge of unease. There must be a reason; he had likely been exposed!</p><p>But he hadn’t done anything yet.</p><p>The man in white trusted his intuition. The only explanation was that Grand True Man Qin’s control over the altar far exceeded his expectations, which also indicated the altar formation’s power was incredibly concentrated.</p><p>Although he still didn't know the altar’s capabilities, discovering this point revealed much.  This altar formation was no simple matter!</p><p>Fortunately, the formation wasn’t complete; otherwise, he might be in serious trouble this time!</p><p>Thinking of this, the man in white immediately retreated from the temple. Contrary to his usual behavior, he used escape techniques, flying through the air and vanishing from sight.</p><p>Whether he had been exposed or not, he couldn't stay here any longer!</p>
