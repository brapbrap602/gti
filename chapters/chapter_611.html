<h1>Chapter 604: The Small Lake Stone Formation</h1><p>The Tianshan Mountains loomed ahead.</p><p>Like a giant sword piercing the sky, magnificent and imposing.</p><p>Immortal clouds wreathed the mountain, countless ancient halls dotted its slopes, and a dense array of shimmering immortal restrictions glowed with a strange light.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a meteor-like streak of light fly into the mountains, breaking through a barrier and entering one of the ancient halls. He knew it must be another Nascent Soul ancestor arriving.</p><p>Lord Dongyang, seemingly afraid of being discovered, lowered his escape light early, concealed his aura, and cautiously made his way through the forest, approaching the mountains.</p><p>Later, he circled to the back of the mountains and ascended on foot, still at an incredible speed, while remaining hidden.</p><p>Carried by Lord Dongyang, Qin Sang had no control over his movements. He could only observe the scenery of the Tianshan Mountains in passing, secretly speculating on the purpose of Lord Dongyang and Chen Yan's visit.</p><p>He wondered why they were being so secretive.</p><p>Nearing the halfway point up the mountain, Lord Dongyang paused, looked around for a moment, and then turned towards the left.</p><p>The left side was a sheer cliff, but upon closer inspection, a narrow stone path was revealed, carved into the cliff face. It seemed artificial yet blended seamlessly with the natural surroundings.</p><p>At the other end of the stone path lay a valley, a riot of color!</p><p>The valley floor was level, covered in a sea of flowers of every hue, a breathtaking sight. At the heart of this floral expanse was a small lake.</p><p>The lake, like a jewel set amidst the flowers, was remarkably still. Its clear, transparent surface reflected the sea of clouds and the silhouette of the Tianshan Mountains.</p><p>‘Slap!’</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt himself grabbed and tossed onto a patch of flowers by the lake by Lord Dongyang.</p><p>Caught off guard, Qin Sang stumbled, barely managing to regain his balance. He was startled to see several figures appear beside him. It was Qiu Mubai, Mu Yifeng, and the other two.</p><p>The four had appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Despite their proximity just moments ago, Qin Sang hadn't sensed them at all, only noticing them after being thrown here. Furthermore, the view from here was no different from before.</p><p>The methods of Nascent Soul ancestors were truly wondrous.</p><p>Qiu Mubai and the others looked at Qin Sang with equal surprise.</p><p>Connected by the mark, they had been found by Lord Dongyang shortly after entering the inner hall and brought here. They had been waiting for a while, curious about Qin Sang's late arrival.</p><p>“Senior Brother Qiu, Senior Brother Mu…”</p><p>Qin Sang greeted each of them.</p><p>Mu Yifeng stepped forward and punched Qin Sang lightly, his expression mixed with concern and excitement. “Where have you been, kid? We thought you…”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back.</p><p>Lord Dongyang stood by the lake, looking alternately at the water and towards the mountains beyond. Qiu Mubai and the others were present, but Chen Yan was missing. She was likely still outside searching for him.</p><p>Qin Sang explained in a low voice, “As soon as I entered the inner hall, I fell into an illusion formation. The illusions inside were terrifying, just like the real world. At first, I thought it was all real, unable to see through the deception. Later, I realized something was wrong and recognized it as an illusion formation, but I was trapped. It was an ancient immortal formation, beyond my current cultivation to break. Fortunately, I was rescued by the ancestor, or I would have been trapped inside forever…”</p><p>“You're so unlucky!”</p><p>Mu Yifeng felt a pang of fear for Qin Sang. The four of them had landed on outer fragments and encountered no danger, only Qin Sang had stumbled upon such an improbable event.</p><p>“It's fortunate it was only an illusion formation, a blessing in disguise!” Mu Yifeng sighed.</p><p>“What was the ancient immortal formation like? Can you tell us about it, Junior Brother Qin?” Ji Qing asked curiously.</p><p>Qiu Mubai and Yu Wansen were also interested.</p><p>The legends of the Ziwei Palace had captivated them, and each harbored the hope of obtaining ancient treasures.</p><p>They were fortunate to have entered at the False Core Realm, yet they had seen nothing before being brought here. They dared not venture elsewhere, intensely curious about the outside.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head repeatedly, his expression serious. “Immortal formations are incredibly dangerous, don't be curious! I only fell into a remnant formation. There must be countless similar places within the Ziwei Palace, each capable of easily obliterating us. Don't wander off, stay…”</p><p>His words were cut short as Qin Sang felt a light breeze and quickly fell silent.</p><p>Turning around, he saw Chen Yan standing by the lake, seemingly having appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>Lord Dongyang pointed at Qin Sang and said to Chen Yan, “This disobedient disciple fell into the Sword Scar Mountain over there and was trapped by an illusion formation. He stumbled upon a weak point, which allowed me to sense the fluctuation of the mark. Fortunately, it didn't delay your important matter, or I would have taken his life right then and there!”</p><p>Chen Yan glanced at Qin Sang and said indifferently, “It’s good that he’s been found. Let’s not create any more complications. The Five Elements Beast Seals are all here, Fellow Daoist Dongyang, shouldn’t we be going?”</p><p>Lord Dongyang turned and looked up towards the peak of Tianshan.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others followed his gaze, seeing nothing but white clouds.</p><p>Lord Dongyang seemed to discern something, saying in a deep voice, “Not many people have arrived yet, especially not that old Zhenyi. I suspect that old goat is preoccupied with the war and no longer cares about treasure hunting. We still have plenty of time. Follow me…”</p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, the waters of the small lake parted, revealing a staircase of white jade leading down to a circular stone platform at the bottom of the lake.</p><p>Lord Dongyang took the lead, and Qin Sang and the others were involuntarily drawn downwards, with Chen Yan bringing up the rear.</p><p>Upon reaching the stone platform, Lord Dongyang took out a square white jade seal and pressed it into the center of the platform.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others noticed a recess there, perfectly fitting the jade seal.</p><p>In an instant, the stone platform lit up, and restrictions emerged.</p><p>“Lady Chen Yan, please.”</p><p>Lord Dongyang retrieved the jade seal and gestured for them to step onto the platform.</p><p>Chen Yan frowned at the platform. “Will this really lead to where my master disappeared?”</p><p>Lord Dongyang chuckled. “We’ve come this far, I wouldn't deceive you, would I? Have you forgotten, Lady Chen Yan, when I first met you? Back then, my cultivation was far inferior to your master’s, yet my speed was no slower than yours. It was thanks to this shortcut.”</p><p>Chen Yan nodded noncommittally and stepped onto the platform, then added, “Shouldn't we conceal this with a formation?”</p><p>“No need.”</p><p>Lord Dongyang shook his head. “I know you’re eager to save your master, and caution is good. But rest assured, this path is one-way. Activating the restrictions on the stone platform requires this jade seal. Those old foxes are cunning; setting up a formation would only alert them.”</p><p>The six stood at the center of the platform.</p><p>Lord Dongyang raised the jade seal, and with the infusion of his True Essence, the seal activated the platform's restrictions. White light surged from the ground, forming a funnel that sucked Qin Sang and the others into the earth.</p><p>The six vanished on the spot, and the stone platform and small lake returned to their original state.</p><p>Qin Sang's vision flickered, and when he regained his senses, he found himself standing in a dark tunnel.</p>
