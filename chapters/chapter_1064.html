<h1>Chapter 156: Spirit Suppression Domain, Reaching Heaven Peak</h1><p>“The valley is vast, extending far inwards. The terrain isn't entirely barren wasteland…”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui took out a jade bottle and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>“The poison in the valley is colorless and odorless, very difficult to detect. By the time you realize it, you've already been affected. These are Snow Toad Pills, they can neutralize the poison.”</p><p>Qin Sang thanked her, opening the jade bottle.</p><p>The pills were snow-white, yet he smelled a pungent aroma.</p><p>“The deeper you go into the valley, the more potent the poison becomes. Initially, you can use your true essence to resist it, but later you'll need poison-repelling treasures, otherwise, it will be impossible to proceed. Fellow Daoist, you're prepared, right?”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui inquired.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>After their previous conversation, he had heeded Ning Wu Hui's warning and had been preparing ever since. Although he possessed the Venomous Silkworm's protective carapace, as an extra precaution, he had purchased some poison-repelling treasures and spirit pills while passing through Tianxing City.</p><p>However, the quality of the antidotes he bought was certainly inferior to the Snow Toad Pills.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui nodded slightly, activating a poison-resistant artifact for protection, and said with some concern, “If you feel anything unusual, if the potent poison infiltrates you, immediately take a Snow Toad Pill. I have a few more poison-repelling treasures that can handle it…”</p><p>“Thank you for the reminder, Fellow Daoist. I understand.”</p><p>Qin Sang woke the Venomous Silkworm, hiding it inside his inner armor.</p><p>The silkworm, clutching a Poison Algae fruit, gnawed away happily, allowing Qin Sang to manipulate it.</p><p>The power of the protective carapace was evident, and to avoid exhausting the silkworm too much, Qin Sang didn't plan to use it for the initial part of the journey, confident he could manage on his own.</p><p>Then, he took out a purchased poison-repelling pearl and held it in his mouth. Once activated, a transparent, invisible film of water coated his body.</p><p>Prepared, the two entered the valley.</p><p>At first, they felt nothing. After walking for a while, the potency of the poison gradually became apparent, and the poison-repelling pearl began to take effect.</p><p>They had initially thought that the Night Owl, having been severely injured and escaping the valley, might indicate some upheaval within.  Unexpectedly, they found no signs of chaos after entering.</p><p>Perhaps the path they chose was too remote.</p><p>Regardless, avoiding any turmoil was always a good thing.</p><p>Even Ning Wu Hui, having formed her Nascent Soul through unorthodox means, didn't dare to be reckless in the valley. Those who reached this point were generally Nascent Soul ancestors, and they were among the weakest.</p><p>Every so often, Ning Wu Hui would release her Nascent Soul to scout ahead.</p><p>Even the slightest anomaly would prompt a detour. Qin Sang followed closely, secretly using his Heavenly Eye to remain vigilant.</p><p>With each step, the poison in the air intensified.</p><p>The poison-repelling pearl gradually faltered. The watery film around Qin Sang became tinged with a faint grayish-black as the potent poison threatened to break through. The pearl itself also grew dimmer.</p><p>Qin Sang had already prepared new poison-repelling treasures and quickly swapped the pearl out when it neared its limit.</p><p>Thus, they progressed, stopping and starting, venturing deeper and deeper into the valley.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui showed no intention of stopping.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that as they traveled, the valley floor was gradually, subtly rising, like a massive gentle slope.</p><p>The ground, initially a near-desert of scattered gravel, became increasingly solid, revealing sharp, jagged rocks.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Ning, how much further?”</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but ask.</p><p>They had traveled a distance that could have crossed the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, yet the end of the valley remained out of sight.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui was tight-lipped.  She had only told him they would enter the valley and advised him to prepare poison-repelling items.  Other than that, she had revealed no secrets.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had sought out Ning Wu Hui following Elder Green Bamboo's instructions, he had no token.  Ning Wu Hui's willingness to bring him along was already fortunate.</p><p>He suspected Ning Wu Hui might be a contingency plan left by Elder Green Bamboo to suppress his split soul. The matter was of great importance, so he hadn't pressed her further.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui paused, looked around thoughtfully, and then said, “This is only the middle section of the valley. We need to reach the deepest part.”</p><p>“The deepest part?”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly startled. That was the furthest point the human cultivation world could currently explore, and they were actually going there.</p><p>What was Elder Green Bamboo planning, and was it related to the ancient teleportation formation?</p><p>“Indeed,” Ning Wu Hui nodded, then changed the subject. “In the deepest part of the valley, there is an area called the Spirit Suppression Domain. Have you heard of it?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then replied helplessly, “I haven't. I can only contact Foundation Establishment cultivators to gather information. Very few Foundation Establishment cultivators have been to the valley, let alone the Spirit Suppression Domain at its deepest point.”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui wasn't surprised.  She explained, “The Spirit Suppression Domain is a peculiar area. It's unclear whether it conceals an ancient formation or something else, but cultivators who enter feel a strange suppression. It's said that only Grand Cultivators or peak Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivators can withstand it and enter the Spirit Suppression Domain. Others can only look on from afar.”</p><p>“Such a place exists?”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly realized something. “Do you intend to enter the Spirit Suppression Domain, Fellow Daoist Ning?”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui nodded. “Don’t worry, Fellow Daoist. I know another way that will allow us to bypass the effects of the Spirit Suppression Domain.”</p><p>“Another way…”</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback, realizing this path must have been revealed to Ning Wu Hui by Elder Green Bamboo.</p><p>A secret unknown to so many Nascent Soul ancestors in the Canghai Sea, yet Elder Green Bamboo had discovered it.  It seemed Elder Green Bamboo knew more about the Seven Kills Sect than he had imagined.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui offered a brief explanation, then fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang could only suppress his curiosity and follow Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>They continued for an unknown distance.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui suddenly changed direction, no longer following the edge straight ahead but diagonally towards the center of the valley.  After a while, Qin Sang noticed the terrain begin to change.</p><p>The rolling hills transformed into small mountains, although they were similarly barren and rocky.</p><p>The shadows of the mountains ahead grew denser and taller.</p><p>The roars of ferocious beasts echoed through the mountains.</p><p>They crossed one mountain range after another.</p><p>Now, they stood on a mountain that was no shorter than the peaks flanking the valley.</p><p>Surrounding them, peaks stood in close array, some seemingly covered in forests, but the vegetation had long since turned to stone.</p><p>“We’ve finally reached Reaching Heaven Peak!”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui pointed towards a distant silhouette.</p><p>Qin Sang followed her gaze and saw a majestic peak unlike any he had seen before, standing tall among the other mountains, piercing the clouds, its summit lost in the celestial glow.</p><p>In terms of sheer height, Reaching Heaven Peak was probably comparable to the Heavenly Tower of the Outer Sect!</p><p>“Reaching Heaven Peak is located at the center of the Spirit Suppression Domain.  Seeing Reaching Heaven Peak means the Spirit Suppression Domain isn't far!” Ning Wu Hui couldn't help but sigh in relief. The journey had been immensely stressful.</p><p>“Which way now?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked quickly.</p><p>“Follow me,” Ning Wu Hui said, flitting down the mountain.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Owe two chapters.</p><p>The plot is at a crucial juncture. Right now, I need to figure out how to write the story in my head completely and keep it organized.  Lacking experience, it's a bit challenging, so I'm being very careful with every sentence, and the writing is very slow.</p><p>Rest assured, I always keep my word. Even if I can't finish this volume, I will definitely catch up in the next one </p>
