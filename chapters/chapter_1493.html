<h1>Chapter 1484: The Sacred Ground Opens</h1><p>A month passed in a flash.  Qin Sang and Liuli were inseparable, tirelessly working at the front lines, maneuvering against the demon horde.  Xuan Tian Palace clearly intended to utilize Qin Sang's ability to infiltrate the demon ranks.  Qin Sang, however, remained unassuming, diligently fulfilling his duties. He had hoped to capture the poisonous cloud steed to feed the fat silkworm, but the demons proved more cautious than anticipated, mirroring their own vigilance.</p><p>Over the month, Qin Sang encountered demon kings only a handful of times, each encounter involving multiple kings heavily guarded within dense beast tides.  After brief standoffs, both sides would withdraw by mutual agreement.  The absence of any confirmed sightings of the two great demon saints made it difficult to draw conclusions, but it didn't rule out the possibility of the Nine-Headed Saint's intervention.  The demons seemed to be probing as well.</p><p>Yin Changsheng, the Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace, held sway over the North Sea; his cultivation and influence were undisputed. This atmosphere of uncertainty, with the storm brewing, was deeply unsettling.</p><p>A month later, demon activity intensified, bringing escalating pressure.  Initial probing skirmishes rapidly escalated into a large-scale battle, inevitably drawing in Qin Sang and Liuli.  Unfortunately, the opposing demon kings were extremely alert, abandoning their troops and fleeing at the first sign of trouble, leaving no opportunity for pursuit.  In the full view of everyone, Qin Sang couldn't use his lightning escape technique.  The battle ended with casualties on both sides, leaving behind a grim tableau of corpses outside Juyao Island, as the demon army loomed like a dark cloud.</p><p>Against this backdrop, the opening of the Sacred Ground arrived as scheduled.  Taking advantage of a lull in the fighting, after consultation, they decided to proceed as planned. Qin Sang and the others secretly left Juyao Island.</p><p>This time, only Jiang Dianzhu, Qin Sang, Liuli, and another Yuan Ying cultivator, along with a few talented younger disciples from Listening Snow Tower, entered the Sacred Ground; Shi Xue and the others remained on Juyao Island.  The other factions followed a similar pattern, leaving most of their powerful cultivators behind to guard against a demon incursion.  According to Tong Lingyu, this gathering would be the most understated in years.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Whoosh!’ A massive wave crashed down, sending up a spray of white water.</p><p>“To think the Xuan Tian Palace Sacred Ground isn't in Yinri Realm,” Qin Sang exclaimed, standing on a small island, reflecting on their journey.</p><p>After returning to Yinri Realm from Juyao Island, Tong Lingyu obtained the ice demon crystal and led everyone into one of the Seventy-Two Springs. They then traversed a highly secretive area, stepping onto an ancient teleportation array.  The other end of this array was this unnamed island, seemingly countless miles away from Yinri Realm, in an unknown location.</p><p>Qin Sang only knew they were located at the southernmost tip of the North Sea, not far from the storm belt, but he didn't know the exact location.  This was an intact ancient teleportation array. Even if they had been sent to the far west of the boundless sea, he wouldn't have been surprised.</p><p>The island was heavily guarded, sealed by a powerful formation, preventing both entry and unauthorized departure.  Only with the Palace Master's and Grand Elder's permission could the formation be opened.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu, standing beside Qin Sang, chuckled, “The Sacred Ground is overflowing with treasures, the cornerstone of Xuan Tian Palace. Could any present-day cultivator have created it? Including the Cleansing Pool, all the restrictions date back to ancient times. We can only follow the Sacred Ground's rules. Qingfeng, don’t act rashly once inside.”</p><p>“Understood.” Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He awakened his Sky Eye Butterfly to observe the surroundings. Three sides were just water; no landmarks were visible. To the south lay the shadow-like storm belt; the familiar sight stirred old memories.</p><p>“Will the Palace Master appear today?” he asked, glancing back at the teleportation array hall.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu nodded. “This array requires the combined use of the Palace Master and Grand Elder's tokens to open. This careful measure is why the Sacred Ground’s location has remained secret.”</p><p>“How far is the Sacred Ground from here?”</p><p>“It’s within the storm belt,” Jiang Dianzhu pointed south.</p><p>As they spoke, the teleportation array hall began to pulsate with light.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a look, suppressing their auras. They followed Jiang Dianzhu, standing alongside cultivators from various factions, awaiting the Palace Master.</p><p>Then, a series of clear bird calls echoed from within the hall.</p><p>‘Chirp… chirp…’</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression was peculiar. He glanced at the other Yuan Ying cultivators; they appeared unconcerned, not finding this unusual.</p><p>The next moment, a strong gust of wind suddenly burst from the hall.  The first thing that caught everyone's eye was a magnificent bird, a rare Chongming bird!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Chongming bird, with its piercing double pupils, glared fiercely, intimidating all who beheld it.  Showing no fear of the Yuan Ying cultivators, it spread its wings, soared from the hall, pulling behind it a resplendent palanquin, exuding an aura of authority.</p><p>The cultivators' eyes lit up at the sight of the bird and the palanquin.</p><p>For this divine bird palanquin belonged to the Palace Master!</p><p>The Palace Master hadn't broken their promise, having arrived in person to open the sacred grounds, thus dispelling the previous rumors.</p><p>Qin Sang, equally curious about this mysterious Palace Master, shifted his gaze from the Chongming bird to the palanquin.  However, three sides were enclosed, and the remaining side was concealed by tassels, making it impossible to see inside.</p><p>“Greetings, Palace Master.”</p><p>Tong Lingyu stepped forward and bowed.</p><p>The others followed suit.</p><p>The palanquin hovered in mid-air, the Chongming bird surveying the Yuan Ying cultivators with a look of smug satisfaction.</p><p>A calm voice emanated from within the palanquin, “I apologize for the wait.  Grand Elder, open the formation quickly.”</p><p>“Right away!”</p><p>Tong Lingyu patted her pouch, producing a half-jade tablet.</p><p>Simultaneously, the palanquin's tassels swayed, and a stream of light flew out, joining the two halves of the jade tablet.  The complete tablet shot upward, embedding itself in the protective dome above the islet.</p><p>Silently, the dome opened a circular aperture.</p><p>The Chongming bird, flapping its wings, pulled the palanquin through the opening.</p><p>Tong Lingyu then summoned a spirit boat large enough for everyone, turning to the others.  “Fellow cultivators, please embark.”</p><p>Once everyone was aboard, Tong Lingyu sealed the spirit boat's restrictions, steered it away from the islet,  retrieved the jade tablet, and followed the palanquin south, directly into the storm zone.</p><p>Instantly, the spirit boat was enveloped by the hurricane, the sky darkening ominously.</p><p>The palanquin and the spirit boat navigated the tempestuous winds, expertly weaving through the storm.</p><p>Those on the spirit boat, their senses blocked by the boat's restrictions, could only see the ubiquitous hurricane. The restrictions weren't exceptionally strong, but any attempt to send messages outward would be instantly detected by the Grand Elder and the Palace Master.</p><p>After a short while,</p><p>The spirit boat shuddered to a halt.  The divine bird palanquin had already stopped.</p><p>Looking outside, Qin Sang saw no obvious landmarks; the Xuan Tian Palace's sacred grounds were well-hidden.</p><p>Then, Tong Lingyu produced the ice box familiar to Qin Sang.</p><p>She gently placed her hand above the box; light flickered from her palm, flowing across the surface of the box, activating layers of restrictions.</p><p>‘Click!’</p><p>The ice box opened, revealing a regular, transparent crystal—the Ice Demon Crystal!</p>
