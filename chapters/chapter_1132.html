<h1>Chapter 1124: Sparring</h1><p>Qin Sang knew.</p><p>Over the years, Wanderer Yunyou had selected many individuals.</p><p>Among them were undoubtedly geniuses from both the human and demon races, each with greater talent than himself, each with more potential to go further.</p><p>Yet, in the end, he had entrusted the Charred Wood to Qin Sang.</p><p>This was not only a matter of trust but also Wanderer Yunyou's acknowledgment of Qin Sang and his boundless expectations.</p><p>"Can the birth of a weapon spirit truly bring the senior back to life?"</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fist tightly.</p><p>After hearing Wanderer Yunyou's words in the jade slip, Qin Sang had agreed without hesitation.</p><p>If there was a chance to revive Wanderer Yunyou, who else but him could shoulder this responsibility?</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt the weight on his shoulders grow heavier.</p><p>On the path of immortality, he now carried something called responsibility.</p><p>"Uncle-Master."</p><p>Li Yufu, seeing Qin Sang standing silently for so long, couldn't help but call out.</p><p>"Yufu, from now on, it will be just you and me relying on each other."</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts, patted Li Yufu's shoulder, and sighed softly.</p><p>He quietly stored away the Charred Wood and the Calamity Alleviation Pill. Now was not the time to inspect treasures.</p><p>"Let's return."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, his gaze settling in the direction of the Great Sui Dynasty. He spoke solemnly, "The person is gone, but there is no need for sorrow. We, the younger generation, must forge ahead with determination, living up to the expectations of our seniors."</p><p>Although Wanderer Yunyou had left behind a contingency plan, both Qin Sang and Li Yufu understood that the hope was slim.</p><p>Li Yufu vowed, "This disciple will surely bring glory to the Azure Goat Temple."</p><p>They cleared away all traces and returned to their cave abode.</p><p>Inside the cave, Tan Yi'en and Bai Hanqiu were aware that Wanderer Yunyou was about to undergo his tribulation.</p><p>If he succeeded, they would have another Nascent Soul Patriarch to rely on.</p><p>Though their foundation was slightly weaker than that of the top sects, they were no less capable than the disciples of major sects. Both senior and junior siblings had lost their focus on cultivation, sitting in the main hall, anxiously awaiting the outcome.</p><p>The formation outside the mountain was triggered, and spiritual light flickered.</p><p>"They're back!"</p><p>Tan Yi'en's face lit up with joy.</p><p>The two hurriedly flew out of the cave to welcome them, but only Qin Sang and Li Yufu returned.</p><p>Seeing their expressions, the senior and junior siblings faintly sensed something.</p><p>"Great-Grandmaster, he…"</p><p>Qin Sang spoke gravely, "The senior failed his tribulation. Keep this in your hearts and do not spread it."</p><p>The two stood frozen, unable to believe it.</p><p>Tan Yi'en murmured, "The Nascent Soul Tribulation is truly terrifying…"</p><p>Qin Sang and Li Yufu entered the forbidden area of the mountain.</p><p>Here, an altar was set up, bearing the spirit tablets of three individuals.</p><p>Daoist Jixin, Mingyue, and Li Yufu's disciple, Jingtian.</p><p>Jingtian was a mortal. Despite Li Yufu never forgetting this disciple and often bringing him spiritual pills to nourish his body, it was ultimately futile.</p><p>However, Jingtian had taken in many disciples, revitalizing the secular lineage of the Azure Goat Temple. Now, the Azure Goat Temple on Cuiming Mountain was a flourishing and prosperous Daoist temple.</p><p>Li Yufu meticulously placed Wanderer Yunyou's spirit tablet at the top and bowed respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the familiar names on the spirit tablets.</p><p>Back then, when he had returned from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and saw Wanderer Yunyou's spirit tablet in the Azure Goat Temple, he had even joked about it with Li Yufu. Now, it had become reality.</p><p>"Can the senior possibly be reborn through the body of a sword spirit, relying on that wisp of primordial true spirit?"</p><p>Qin Sang silently communicated with Bai.</p><p>On the way back, Qin Sang had explained everything to Bai, seeking his opinion.</p><p>Without a doubt, if the Charred Wood were to be integrated into a treasure, the Ebony Sword was the best choice. Qin Sang still had half a piece of Soul-Nourishing Wood, and it wouldn't be difficult to elevate the Ebony Sword to the level of a supreme-grade treasure.</p><p>As Qin Sang's life-bound treasure, the Ebony Sword would be easier to control during the integration process, ensuring that Wanderer Yunyou's primordial true spirit remained unharmed.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had been searching for a way to advance his treasure to the level of a spirit treasure.</p><p>Now he knew the method.</p><p>But he wished he didn't!</p><p>Bai remained silent for a long time before suddenly asking, "If I said there was no hope, would you still do it?"</p><p>Qin Sang silently shook his head.</p><p>He knew he wouldn't give up.</p><p>After a pause, Bai continued, "The path of immortality we seek is equally elusive. Among the countless cultivators in the world, who can be certain they will achieve immortality? The vast world is full of wonders. In the realm of cultivation, anything is possible!"</p><p>This truth, Qin Sang understood all too well.</p><p>Where is the path to immortality?</p><p>Is there still a chance for Yagu to awaken?</p><p>Can Wanderer Yunyou be reborn?</p><p>Or are these merely beautiful hopes?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the outcome. All he could do was remain steadfast and take each step with determination.</p><p>Bai thought for a moment and then reminded him.</p><p>"I never expected his origin to be the Blessed Bamboo.</p><p>"If it were an ordinary plant spirit, even if you captured a living one and refined it into a treasure, it wouldn't be easy to advance to the level of a spirit treasure.</p><p>"This kind of heavenly treasure is born from the essence of heaven and earth and cannot be compared to ordinary plants. Even after perishing in the heavenly tribulation, it still retains the ability to preserve its primordial true spirit.</p><p>"Not only is it incredibly difficult for heavenly treasures to develop sentience, but they also have numerous natural enemies. Out of millions of heavenly treasures, it's uncertain if even one will have the fortune to become a spirit.</p><p>"Integrating this piece of Charred Wood will undoubtedly imbue the treasure with spiritual nature, but whether it can give birth to a weapon spirit is uncertain. It will depend on your cultivation and fortune.</p><p>"However, you must be careful. If you don't want to damage that fragile primordial true spirit, you need to be extremely meticulous. It's best to wait until you form your Nascent Soul before proceeding.</p><p>"Truly integrating this piece of Charred Wood into the Ebony Sword and merging it with the primordial true spirit may take a very long time.</p><p>"During this process, it's best not to use the Ebony Sword in battle…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded upon hearing this. "Thank you for the reminder, my friend. I know what to do."</p><p>Protecting Wanderer Yunyou's primordial true spirit was the top priority. At most, he would lose some combat power.</p><p>He still had other treasures at his disposal, so he wasn't worried.</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture" would no longer engrave new killing runes. His cultivation would mainly revolve around the seven sword souls, so not being able to use his life-bound spirit sword wouldn't affect his progress.</p><p>After paying their respects.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed for a while longer.</p><p>"Before I form my Nascent Soul, you need not consider establishing a sect. Remember to focus on your cultivation. In the world of cultivation, strength is the foundation!"</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang admonished the three.</p><p>He glanced at Li Yufu, somewhat concerned about his state of mind. "Yufu, you are a prodigy, having inherited your Great-Grandmaster's true teachings. You should go far on the path of immortality. Revitalizing the Azure Goat Temple, though it was your Great-Grandmaster's wish, is a trivial matter compared to your own cultivation. If you become fixated on it and confine yourself to the Azure Goat Temple, it is not what your Great-Grandmaster would have wanted…"</p><p>Li Yufu remained silent for a moment before bowing. "This disciple will heed your teachings."</p><p>Whether Li Yufu truly took it to heart was uncertain. This was a mental barrier, and only he could overcome it.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>He glanced at the cave abode, as if Wanderer Yunyou were still inside, cultivating.</p><p>The events of this period felt like a dream.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and left, flying back to Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Mist rolled in.</p><p>The spiritual formation activated.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to enter the valley.</p><p>Bai suddenly emerged from the Corpse Puppet Bag and looked at Qin Sang. "Do you want to spar?"</p><p>Qin Sang was silent for a moment.</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>With a flash of light.</p><p>The two flew together into the Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p>
