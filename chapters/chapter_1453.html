第一千四百四十五章 Shifting Sands Escape

After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang decided to give it a try. "I possess an incomplete secret art, and its cultivation is exceedingly difficult."
As he spoke, Qin Sang swiftly retrieved a blank jade slip and inscribed the first layer of the *Kindling Golden Lotus* into it.
"Alas, I've been reduced to selling secret arts for a living."
Qin Sang shook his head. He would never share such a top-tier secret art with others unless absolutely necessary, lest he cultivate a rival for himself.
However, if he could obtain the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal*, it would be worth it.
He didn't deliberately conceal the flaws, as the other party would easily see through them.
Qin Sang raised his palm in a gesture, and the jade slip floated forward, passing through a layer of restriction he had personally laid, and floated in mid-air together with the Nether Asura Thorn.
However, Qin Sang didn't release his divine sense. He added, "I don't want cultivation methods. If this fellow daoist is interested, I hope to exchange it for an Earth-attribute escape technique."
The other party understood, chuckled softly, and replied noncommittally, "An incomplete secret art, and its cultivation is exceedingly difficult. This humble one only worries that my aptitude is dull, and I won't be able to grasp the basics!"
As he spoke, that person sent a wisp of his divine sense over.
Qin Sang concealed the core content and only allowed him to view it alone.
A moment later.
That person suddenly uttered a soft exclamation, arousing curiosity among the others.
After hesitating for a moment, that person said solemnly, "This fellow daoist's secret art is indeed not simple, but its flaws are also unimaginably large! When this fellow daoist obtained this secret art, I wonder if there were any other things nearby?"
The other party actually guessed that this secret art was too dangerous and might have auxiliary cultivation methods or items.
He didn't directly refuse. Could it be that he had also subdued some kind of spiritual flame, or had the confidence to avoid the danger?
Qin Sang's thoughts raced, and he brought out a prepared excuse. "This technique is a treasure of my sect. If there were such things, why would I devote my energy to another path? After all, compared to this flaw, the second condition is always more likely to be satisfied."
The second condition referred to spiritual flames. As long as one was willing to spend time, one could slowly collect various spiritual flames and condense Fire Lotus Seeds.
'Another path' referred to body refinement.
According to the understanding of most Nascent Soul cultivators, when encountering bottlenecks in cultivation, some might try to start from the physical body and divine sense to seek opportunities.
But even a heaven's chosen with a Heavenly Spiritual Root could not balance the three levels of Essence, Qi, and Spirit.
Qin Sang made it clear that he was determined to obtain the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal*, indicating that he had already achieved considerable attainments in body cultivation. He must have failed to make progress with his divine sense, otherwise why would he possess a top-tier divine sense secret art and not cultivate it?
This was very reasonable.
Who would have thought that Qin Sang relied on the Jade Buddha to cultivate several cultivation methods and secret arts that others would consider impossible to master, embarking on a different path!
After a long silence.
The other party weighed it for a long time and finally spoke, while also taking out a jade slip. "I have a *Shifting Sands Escape*, but it can't be called top-tier. I'm afraid it won't meet that fellow daoist's requirements."
This person is not simple, he really wants to buy the *Kindling Golden Lotus*!
Qin Sang's thoughts raced. After consulting the other party and Venerable Chongtai, he invited the owner of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* to join the transaction.
After the owner of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* examined the *Shifting Sands Escape*, he hesitated for a moment and asked Qin Sang, "Is fellow daoist a body cultivator?"
Qin Sang chuckled and answered evasively, "Fellow daoist, don't be too greedy."
The owner of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* was silent for a moment, and then made up his mind. "The *Shifting Sands Escape* plus the Nether Asura Thorn, in exchange for the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal*!"
Qin Sang frowned.
His actions had advantages and disadvantages. He dispelled the other person's doubts, but allowed the owner of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* to confidently demand a high price (lit. a lion's big mouth).
"These old guys are all cunning as devils, it's impossible to find a bargain here."
Understanding this point, Qin Sang put aside his hesitation and glanced at the clusters of white light around him. "Add two drops of Heavenly Crown Heavy Liquid!"
"One drop!"
"Deal!"
Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. No matter how the owner of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* bought the Heavenly Crown Heavy Liquid, he turned around to haggle with the other person.
Before Qin Sang could speak, the other party said, "Hehe, even if this fellow daoist's secret art is incomplete, its value still steadily exceeds the *Shifting Sands Escape*. What else does fellow daoist want?"
This person was quite straightforward.
Qin Sang softened his tone and said, "Fellow daoist, help me exchange for that Azure Dot Gold, or the Fluffy Cloud Crystal."
The crowd watched silently. They guessed that Qin Sang was preparing to refine a magic treasure, but although the three spiritual materials had similar properties, they couldn't be mixed and used like that, which made them somewhat confused.
After a dazzling exchange of hands.
The jade slip and Nether Asura Thorn in front of Qin Sang's bamboo building disappeared.
He had three more things in his hand.
A jade slip.
A piece of Azure Dot Gold the size of a fist, black all over with blue spots.
And a jade bottle containing a drop of silver liquid, which was even heavier than the Azure Dot Gold when held in the hand.
He probed his divine sense into the jade slip, quickly scanned the contents, confirmed that the divine ability was correct, and without detailed inspection, temporarily put it away.
With the trade fair proceeding to this point, Qin Sang's transaction was considered the most complicated, involving six Nascent Souls before and after, because the owner of the *Shifting Sands Escape* had gone through another hand when exchanging for the Azure Dot Gold.
All parties were very satisfied with this transaction.
Even more satisfied was Venerable Chongtai, who said with a smile, "Please welcome the next fellow daoist!"
Next, the three bamboo buildings retreated.
Qin Sang glanced at the jade token and thought to himself that he hadn't arrived too late, so why hadn't it been his turn yet.
The sound from outside came in, "Locking Void Sword, exchanging for a supreme-grade magic treasure!"
Hearing this, Qin Sang hurriedly looked up to the outside.
Even at the Myriad Demons Assembly, supreme-grade magic treasures didn't appear very often.
Inside the white light, a jade sword the size of a finger floated.
The jade sword was pure white all over, without any patterns on it.
The moment he saw the jade sword, Qin Sang felt very familiar, it was actually the small jade sword in the hands of the corpse in the Buddha Hall!
"Old Devil Hunmo or Yu Yi Yuanjun?"
Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, as if he wanted to see through the darkness and see the person inside the bamboo building clearly.
He had already found out that the one who entered the Buddha Hall with Old Devil Hunmo was a female demon with the Dharma name Yu Yi Yuanjun. The remaining magic treasures in the Buddha Hall must have fallen into the hands of these two.
It's actually a supreme-grade magic treasure!
If I had known to snatch the jade sword, I wouldn't have had to bother with refining the Gold Sinking Sword.
Qin Sang thought to himself, when he suddenly heard someone questioning, "This is clearly a high-grade magic treasure, how can you want to exchange it for a supreme-grade magic treasure?"
Hearing the questioning, a faint, unchanging laughter came from the bamboo building, "I dare to ask such a price, naturally there is a reason. This sword is not only a high-grade magic treasure, but also contains unknown secrets, but I cannot crack it for the time being. As long as it meets a destined person, I believe its value is definitely no less than a supreme-grade magic treasure, and may even exceed it!"
These words caused an uproar, daring to ask such a high price for a secret that he himself couldn't solve, what a joke!
Although Qin Sang was curious, he had no intention of using his divine sense to check it out, and watched coldly.
