<h1>Chapter 297: The Fool</h1><p>The flying boat sliced through the flames, rapidly escaping.</p><p>Before long, they saw an exceptionally bright silver light speeding through the sea of fire ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen this silver light before. It emanated from Yan Wu's mirror artifact. The lack of noticeable fluctuations within the silver light indicated that the two pursuers hadn't caught up to Yan Wu yet.</p><p>Seeing this, Cloud Wanderer put away the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat.</p><p>Qin Sang led the way, with Cloud Wanderer slightly behind, as they went to meet Yan Wu.</p><p>Suddenly seeing two figures appear before him, Yan Wu was startled.</p><p>After recognizing Qin Sang and Cloud Wanderer, he mistakenly thought Qin Sang was being pursued by Cloud Wanderer. Without waiting for an explanation, he immediately turned his mirror, firing a beam of light directly at Qin Sang.</p><p>Then, he abruptly changed direction, fleeing to the right.</p><p>Yan Wu's first instinct wasn't to join forces with Qin Sang against the enemy, but to force Qin Sang back to block the enemy, buying himself time to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang was both amused and exasperated by this, sighing inwardly, but not entirely surprised.</p><p>Better a dead friend than a dead self.</p><p>Such things were commonplace in the cultivation world.</p><p>However, Yan Wu's actions were truly remarkable. Even though they could have combined forces to kill their opponent, his first reaction was to use Qin Sang as a scapegoat.</p><p>This had little to do with any prior grievances between them. Qin Sang believed that even if he were Wu Chen, Yan Wu would have done the same without hesitation.</p><p>Seeing this, Cloud Wanderer scoffed disdainfully, immediately abandoning any intention of cooperating with Yan Wu.  He said indifferently, "Kill him."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, dodging the mirror's light. At the same time, light flickered beneath Cloud Wanderer's feet. With the aid of the flying boat's power, he effortlessly caught up to Yan Wu, blocking his path.</p><p>Yan Wu, believing his plan had succeeded, hadn't even had time to rejoice before he was trapped by Cloud Wanderer and Qin Sang, one in front and one behind. He was deeply shocked, finally realizing the truth.  "You're together!" he exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer didn't bother with any explanations. He opened his right palm, and the orb within spun rapidly, emitting a jade-green light. It floated towards Yan Wu, seemingly slow but deceptively fast.</p><p>The orb appeared light and without force, yet it filled Yan Wu with a sense of impending doom.  Terror filled his face.</p><p>He tried to retreat.</p><p>But at the same time, Qin Sang tapped his Ebony Sword. The sword moved with uncanny speed, cutting off Yan Wu's escape route.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Cloud Wanderer were seasoned veterans. Both the orb and the Ebony Sword were rare treasures, and they were used in a perfectly coordinated pincer attack.</p><p>Yan Wu had no chance of escape.  Overwhelmed and unable to react effectively, his mirror was knocked away by the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Then, Cloud Wanderer's orb flashed, striking Yan Wu's chest, shattering his heart.</p><p>Yan Wu died instantly.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer used his spiritual power to form a large hand, grabbing Yan Wu's body.  Suddenly, his expression changed slightly, and he transmitted his voice, "They're coming. Run, Brother Qin."</p><p>Without looking back, Qin Sang flew past Cloud Wanderer on his sword, entering the sea of fire, and then activated the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, escaping into the distance.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer, holding Yan Wu's body, faced the approaching Elder Gong and the man surnamed Yin.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, you've arrived a step too late. This humble Daoist has claimed the prize."</p><p>Cloud Wanderer smiled slightly, lifting Yan Wu's body.  He ran his hand over Yan Wu's waist, taking his storage pouch, and then tossed the body aside.</p><p>The two exchanged glances, watching helplessly as the body turned to ash.  They both twitched their lips.</p><p>"The other one…has the Daoist Master dealt with him?" The man surnamed Yin asked tentatively.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer nodded, replying casually, "The junior was disrespectful.  This old Daoist tried to persuade him, but he stubbornly resisted. I had no choice but to kill him. I wanted to help you two resolve the issue as well, but you hadn't arrived yet. I had to act hastily and nearly let him escape."</p><p>The two sneered inwardly, suspecting that the old man was more likely after their treasures and had no intention of taking them alive.</p><p>According to their previous agreement, everyone would rely on their own abilities.  Whoever found the spoils would keep them, and no one else could contest it.</p><p>Two Foundation Establishment cultivators' storage pouches!</p><p>Elder Gong's eyes flickered. He chuckled, "I didn't expect the Daoist Master to be so skilled in both escape techniques and combat.  To effortlessly defeat two opponents of similar cultivation…I'm impressed!"</p><p>"Just a minor trick," Cloud Wanderer said with a眯眼 smile, making no mention of the spoils. He summoned his escape light and flew away.</p><p>The two looked at each other and shook their heads helplessly. They were envious, but they didn't dare force Cloud Wanderer to share the loot.</p><p>In such a short time, Cloud Wanderer had eliminated two opponents while remaining completely unharmed. His strength was unfathomable.</p><p>Outside the sea of fire.</p><p>With Yu Kong dead, Luo Xingnan was in complete control.</p><p>After hearing Elder Gong's report, Luo Xingnan nodded nonchalantly. He strolled over to Shangguan Lifeng, smiling triumphantly, "Boy, how about it? I didn't lie to you, did I? The one who killed your master was either Sheng Yuanzi or that old dog Yu! Yu Kong was the most cunning, and it turns out it was indeed him!"</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng was severely injured, but after taking the medicinal pills, his complexion had improved considerably.</p><p>He coughed violently and said in a hoarse voice, "Don't worry. I will keep my promise and remain here at your service, as repayment."</p><p>Luo Xingnan laughed heartily, pleased with Shangguan Lifeng's attitude. He then turned his gaze to Wu Chen, asking indifferently, "Do you want to live?"</p><p>Wu Chen nodded eagerly.</p><p>…</p><p>After Luo Xingnan and the others left, the restrictive barrier returned to its peaceful state, and the flames seemed to burn eternally.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure materialized – it was Ge Yuan.</p><p>Before Ge Yuan could steady himself, he saw a figure emerge from the sea of fire ahead and immediately went on guard.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ge."</p><p>Qin Sang greeted him from afar with a cupped-hand salute. He observed Ge Yuan closely, noticing that although he appeared uninjured, his aura was somewhat unstable, suggesting a perilous encounter with the serpent horde.</p><p>If not for Cloud Wanderer's secret assistance, he would likely have perished.</p><p>"Has Senior Cloud Wanderer sent any news?"</p><p>"Not yet."</p><p>Recognizing Qin Sang, Ge Yuan relaxed his guard, shook his head, and inquired about the previous events.</p><p>Qin Sang recounted the events truthfully.</p><p>Hearing that Luo Xingnan hadn't lost any men but instead gained more, Ge Yuan frowned, his expression tinged with anxiety.</p><p>Then, as he listened to Qin Sang explain the plan he and Cloud Wanderer had devised, disbelief flickered in Ge Yuan's eyes. He said gravely, "Luo Xingnan is powerful. It's best to avoid conflict with him! Those men are desperate and untrustworthy. How can we be sure they won't help Luo Xingnan eliminate us first? We're here to gather herbs, not to risk our lives!"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Ge Yuan and said nothing more.</p><p>The two waited in silence.</p><p>Suddenly, Ge Yuan's face lit up as he looked towards the blue flames on the left.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>This book is organized and produced by the public account.
