<h1>Chapter 1173: Heavenly Eye Divine Light</h1><p>"Slash!"</p><p>Qin Sang roared fiercely.</p><p>The sword lights seemed disconnected, yet each one erupted with astonishing sword energy, forming a seamless unity within the sword formation, as if wielding the might of a celestial sword.</p><p>The demonic serpent's expression changed.</p><p>He had seen Qin Sang deploy the sword formation before, during a brief exchange. Back then, the power displayed was nowhere near as formidable as it was now!</p><p>Last time, Qin Sang had likely held back, perhaps out of a sense of guilt.</p><p>The Serpent King, Qianji, realized he had miscalculated, underestimating his opponent.</p><p>Even among humans, achieving such mastery in the sword path was exceedingly rare.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The mountains trembled.</p><p>The sword energy shook the heavens.</p><p>The demonic serpent roared, its scales rustling as a layer of black radiance flowed over its body. Its form twisted unnaturally, and chaotic forces filled the surrounding space.</p><p>The power of the sword formation was disrupted.</p><p>However, the sword formation didn't just envelop the serpent's true body. The sword energy, like a river of stars, cascaded from the heavens, accompanied by earth-shaking sword cries, drowning the two illusions.</p><p>Qin Sang's intuition was correct. The illusions of the demonic serpent were no mere phantoms—they possessed considerable combat strength. Yet, they lacked the formidable defenses of the true body.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Before the illusions could fully manifest, they were torn apart, shattering like mirrors into countless fragments that danced and swirled in the air.</p><p>Each fragment reflected the sword shadows and the furious gaze of the demonic serpent.</p><p>The serpent broke free from the sword formation, attempting to reform its illusions. But Qin Sang gave it no chance to recover. With a wave of his hand, the river of sword energy surged toward the serpent!</p><p>The serpent, fierce and unyielding, met the sword formation head-on with its physical body. Some of its scales shattered, revealing crimson flesh, but it paid no heed.</p><p>However, the serpent's miscalculation had cost it dearly. Its shadow-splitting technique was easily dismantled, and Qin Sang seized the upper hand. Reversing the tide of battle would not be so simple.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes remained calm as his true body charged forward, coordinating with the sword formation to deliver a devastating blow, leaving the serpent no room to breathe.</p><p>The serpent made several attempts to reform its illusions, but each failure only worsened its predicament.</p><p>Outside the battlefield.</p><p>The Serpent King watched as the demonic serpent's defeat became apparent.</p><p>Yet, his expression showed no trace of anxiety.</p><p>The seemingly defenseless serpent finally seized its opportunity.</p><p>Its massive body reared up, and with a roar that shook the heavens, its fangs bared, a black light shot from its gaping maw. Moving faster than lightning, it pierced through the sword energy blockade, aiming directly at Qin Sang's true body!</p><p>"I knew it wouldn't be this easy!"</p><p>Despite the sudden turn of events, Qin Sang remained unshaken.</p><p>Demon kings and Nascent Soul cultivators—none were simple. Qianji, the Serpent King, was no mere brute who relied solely on physical combat. Especially in a place like the Coldfrost Domain, they would not lack treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang was satisfied that the sword formation had forced Qianji to reveal one of his trump cards. He knew when to retreat.</p><p>However, as the black light locked onto him, Qin Sang felt his blood churn as if drawn by a bone blade. A faint stinging sensation pricked his brow.</p><p>"A blade! A bone blade!"</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the treasure.</p><p>The bone blade was only three inches long, lacking a hilt, and entirely black. Crafted from an unknown bone, it exuded an eerie aura, firmly locked onto Qin Sang's brow.</p><p>The black light seemed like a bottomless abyss, devouring the surrounding black mist as it surged toward Qin Sang, the bone blade's power escalating with each passing moment.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not delay. He sheathed his sword and retreated, while flicking his sleeve. Nine small spirit banners, including the three he had used earlier, spiraled out.</p><p>He was still concealing his full strength, wary of the Serpent King.</p><p>Now a Nascent Soul cultivator, the power of the nine demon banners in his hands was no longer what it once was, more than sufficient to handle the current situation.</p><p>*Whoosh...*</p><p>The demon banners grew with the wind, expanding to over ten feet tall.</p><p>With a series of *thuds*, the nine banners embedded themselves into the ground, forming a grand formation. Demonic flames surged forth, instantly engulfing Qin Sang in a sea of fire.</p><p>The black mist that had permeated the surroundings met its nemesis in the demonic flames, vanishing in an instant.</p><p>The next moment, the bone blade arrived.</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang condensed the demonic flames into a fireball, which collided squarely with the bone blade.</p><p>A deafening explosion.</p><p>The fireball scattered, flames spilling in all directions, but as expected, it successfully blocked the bone blade's assault.</p><p>The bone blade faltered, its black light dispersing. Its true form became faintly visible, quivering in the void.</p><p>On the blade's surface, faint golden threads, nearly imperceptible to the naked eye, formed strange runes.</p><p>This treasure was ancient, likely a relic from a bygone era.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang prepared to reform the demonic flames, he noticed the serpent's sudden movement.</p><p>At that moment, the serpent unleashed an unknown technique. Behind it, a massive black serpentine shadow materialized, several times larger than its true body, rivaling a mountain in size.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze locked onto the shadow, certain it was not a dharma manifestation, yet it filled him with a sense of threat.</p><p>The next instant, the giant serpent shadow opened its eyes.</p><p>Its eyes were equally massive, like stars in the sky. The shadow let out a silent roar, its eyes glowing intensely, and suddenly shot out two divine beams of light—aimed not at Qin Sang, but at the bone blade!</p><p>Qianji, the Serpent King, wore a confident expression.</p><p>Qin Sang's strength had exceeded expectations, but the serpent shadow was his most powerful technique. The bone blade, borrowed from his father-in-law, was a treasure of immense power. Combined, even if they couldn't severely injure Qin Sang, they could at least force him out of the battlefield.</p><p>But then, another sudden change occurred!</p><p>As the serpent's eyes unleashed their divine light, a beam of light shot from Qin Sang's body, striking the center of the serpent shadow's eyes before the divine light could reach its target.</p><p>The beam was chaotic, filled with fine silver threads that, upon closer inspection, were strands of lightning.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Struck by the beam, the serpent shadow froze, its divine light rapidly dimming. In the next moment, cracks appeared on the serpent's head, quickly spreading across its body.</p><p>Qianji grunted, his eyes filled with shock and confusion.</p><p>He had been struck by his own technique!</p><p>A strange expression crossed Qin Sang's face.</p><p>The beam of light had not come from him, but from the Heavenly Eye Butterfly!</p><p>This was a technique the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had comprehended after its fourth transformation. Qin Sang called it the Heavenly Eye Divine Light.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Divine Light possessed the extraordinary ability to disrupt techniques and target the weaknesses of spells and divine abilities. Though it had its limitations, when timed precisely, it could not only dismantle techniques but even cause the opponent to suffer backlash from their own abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure if all Heavenly Eye Butterflies could comprehend this technique after their fourth transformation, or if it was a result of his butterfly's unique mutation, merging two abilities into one.</p><p>This was his first time using it in battle, and the results exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Caught off guard, Qianji had fallen victim to his own technique. Desperately trying to stabilize the serpent shadow and resist the backlash, he was momentarily unable to focus on the bone blade.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang commanded the demonic flames to violently repel the bone blade, then charged straight at Qianji, aiming to finish him off in one decisive move.</p><p>Qianji, still unaware of how he had been defeated, wore an expression of unwillingness. He prepared to unleash a self-destructive secret technique in a final, desperate counterattack.</p><p>But at that moment, a sigh echoed from the distance.</p><p>"Enough! There's no need to continue. Fellow Daoist Mingyue, your skills are superior. We concede defeat!"</p>
