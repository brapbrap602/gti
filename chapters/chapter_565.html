<h1>Chapter 558: Heroes Gather</h1><p>Duke Dongyang readily agreed and led his people to the other end of the Jade Ruyi.</p><p>After everyone was settled, Daoist Chongyi activated the Jade Ruyi. The white jade was instantly covered in a rich green light, which continued to expand until it enveloped everyone.</p><p>Immediately, the Jade Ruyi trembled slightly and rushed towards the restrictive barrier.</p><p>Daoist Chongyi shouted, "Open!"</p><p>A crack appeared in the barrier, and chaotic spiritual energy surged in. Daoist Chongyi didn't hesitate, controlling the Jade Ruyi to charge into the Spirit Tide.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A monstrous wave crashed towards them.</p><p>The Jade Ruyi nimbly dodged, only being brushed by the wave's aftershock. Even then, it shuddered violently, its green light dimming slightly. Qin Sang and the others were also affected, stumbling around.</p><p>"Steady!"</p><p>Daoist Chongyi and Duke Dongyang acted together, finally stabilizing the rocking Jade Ruyi.</p><p>The Jade Ruyi then swished its tail like a carp, effortlessly dodging another surge of the Spirit Tide. Its speed suddenly increased, heading straight for the heart of the tide.</p><p>The winds howled and the waves raged.</p><p>The Jade Ruyi resembled a lone boat in a hurricane, appearing incredibly fragile, as if it would capsize at any moment.</p><p>Everyone's faces paled, shocked and awed by the terrifying power of nature.</p><p>It was said that this wasn't even the most violent period of the Spirit Tide, yet the two Nascent Soul Grandmasters were solemn, not daring to be careless.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that leaving the Jade Ruyi's protection now would mean certain death. He sat cross-legged, not daring to move.</p><p>Beside him were Qiu Mubai and the others, five of them forming a circle at the center.</p><p>Chen Yan, Iron Crown, Feng Ming, and the others stood on the periphery, forming a protective circle. Duke Dongyang stood alone at the tail of the Jade Ruyi, unmoving no matter how it swayed.</p><p>Chen Yan sat quietly not far from Qin Sang, showing no signs of true essence fluctuation. Even Daoist Chongyi couldn't see through Chen Yan's true cultivation level.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered Granny Jing saying that Chen Yan had already overcome the Nascent Soul tribulation and was a true Nascent Soul Grandmaster, yet deliberately concealed her identity. She likely had ulterior motives.</p><p>After flying for a while, the Jade Ruyi became increasingly stable, and the green light steadily protected them. Everyone gradually relaxed, some even having the leisure to observe the surrounding scenery, including Qin Sang.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, the world was filled with the raging Spirit Tide. This chaotic spiritual energy sometimes gathered into clusters, sometimes resembling giant pythons, roaming freely.</p><p>These clusters of energy, even the small ones, were the size of giant whales, while the larger ones stretched beyond the horizon.</p><p>They were restless, constantly changing, gathering and dispersing, yet incredibly fast, traversing hundreds of feet in the blink of an eye. It was impossible to perfectly dodge them in this environment.</p><p>The room to maneuver was minimal. Even with two Nascent Soul Grandmasters controlling the Jade Ruyi, it was inevitable that they would be hit by the Spirit Tide. Fortunately, the Jade Ruyi was extremely sturdy, and they managed to escape unscathed.</p><p>"Eh? Look over there!"</p><p>Someone exclaimed, pointing into the distance.</p><p>Everyone followed their finger and saw a fiery red light soaring into the sky in the distant northeast. The red pillar of light was like a sharp sword piercing the heavens, clearly visible even within the chaotic Spirit Tide.</p><p>"A Secret Realm!"</p><p>Everyone's spirits were lifted.</p><p>The sudden appearance of such a pillar of light could only mean one thing: the restrictive barrier of a Secret Realm had been triggered by the Spirit Tide.</p><p>After a quick exchange, the cultivators of the major sects learned that this location didn't belong to any of them. It was highly likely that a new Secret Realm had just emerged!</p><p>Unfortunately, the Secret Realm seemed very far away, and the two Nascent Soul Grandmasters didn't dare to travel freely within the Spirit Tide. Moreover, the Purple Subtlety Palace was their primary objective, and they couldn't change course to explore.</p><p>Those interested noted the location of the Secret Realm, agreeing to explore it after returning from the Purple Subtlety Palace. Judging by the pillar of light, this Secret Realm was undoubtedly extraordinary, possibly containing valuable treasures.</p><p>However, before they could finalize their plans, the pillar of light suddenly fluctuated and then collapsed.</p><p>In an instant, the red light dissipated, and the phenomenon vanished.</p><p>"Sigh!"</p><p>Everyone was disappointed, sighing repeatedly.</p><p>There was a ninety percent chance that the protective barrier of that Secret Realm had failed, breached by the Spirit Tide.</p><p>Even if the Secret Realm wasn't completely destroyed by the Spirit Tide, there wouldn't be many treasures left.</p><p>Such occurrences weren't uncommon in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and they were helpless against them.</p><p>However, this incident reminded Qin Sang. He stopped meditating, widening his eyes to search around, hoping to encounter another such Secret Realm.</p><p>After reaching the Core Formation stage, he had embarked on a new journey. If he could plunder one or two unexplored Secret Realms, he would surely reap a considerable harvest.</p><p>What the Nascent Soul Grandmasters disregarded, he coveted.</p><p>Even within the Spirit Tide, unable to travel at full speed and needing to constantly detour and dodge, the Nascent Soul Grandmasters' speed was still astonishing.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard from Granny Jing that they needed to reach a designated location first to meet up with others.</p><p>The deeper they went into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the stronger the Spirit Tide became. Only by joining forces could all the Nascent Soul Grandmasters dare to venture into the inner layers of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and enter the Purple Subtlety Palace.</p><p>At this moment, the sky above the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was illuminated by the light of the Spirit Tide, making it difficult to distinguish between day and night. They had been flying for an unknown amount of time, the Jade Ruyi never stopping. Even Nascent Soul Grandmasters showed signs of fatigue.</p><p>After evading another surge of spiritual energy, a massive shadow suddenly appeared ahead.</p><p>The shadow stretched from east to west, its ends unseen, lying across their field of vision like a giant dragon prostrate on the ground. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a towering mountain range, a natural barrier.</p><p>Even more peculiar was that three peaks within the range were emitting different colored lights.</p><p>Black demonic energy billowed from the easternmost peak, obscuring the sky and concealing everything within.</p><p>A golden palace rested atop the central peak, with figures faintly visible moving inside.</p><p>The western peak was covered by a red cloud, completely enveloping the summit.</p><p>The three peaks formed a triangular formation, distinct yet supporting each other, jointly resisting the impact of the Spirit Tide. The demonic energy and red cloud were the most imposing, while the golden light appeared slightly dimmer.</p><p>As the Jade Ruyi approached the mountains, four figures suddenly flew out from the red cloud. The leader was none other than the Red-haired Patriarch, the Sect Master of the Pure Yang Sect.</p><p>"Haha, you two fellow Daoists have finally arrived. You've kept us waiting!"</p><p>The Red-haired Patriarch's laughter boomed, echoing from afar.</p><p>On the Jade Ruyi, Duke Dongyang and Daoist Chongyi exchanged glances and replied, "We were delayed on the way, causing you fellow Daoists to wait for so long. Have the others already arrived?"</p><p>The Red-haired Patriarch replied, "Indeed, the Demonic Sect and the rogue cultivators of Yin Mountain Pass have all assembled. Now we're just waiting to rendezvous with the fellow Daoists from Heavenly Monster Hill and then contact those old fogies from the Heavenly Alliance!"</p><p>Duke Dongyang's eyes narrowed slightly. "Have you fellow Daoists still not found the location of the Heavenly Alliance's ancient teleportation formation after searching for so long?"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>The Red-haired Patriarch said irritably, "Those old geezers are very cautious. They only use it when the Purple Subtlety Palace opens, making it impossible to track."</p>
