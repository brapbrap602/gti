Chapter 393: Talismans and Restrictions


A disheveled figure sped through the passage.  Black flames pursued relentlessly,  Yu Hua gaining ground. Qin Sang fled without looking back, his expression shifting constantly.


He held something in his palm – a grey jade-like, oblong talisman, pulsing with a mysterious light that captivated the eye.


The Ice Palace was ahead.  His pursuer was close. The meager spiritual energy he’d managed to recover in his dantian was barely enough to sustain the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman; it was almost depleted.


He couldn't hesitate.


A resolute look flashed in Qin Sang’s eyes. He raised his other hand, expertly weaving a series of restrictions and placing them on himself.  These were restrictions from the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, used in conjunction with the Heavenly Corpse Talisman. Some he'd adapted from Wu Shang's notes.


He'd never imagined using them on himself.  His movements were fluid and rapid, completing the process in an instant. Then, he flipped his palm and pressed the Heavenly Corpse Talisman onto his forehead.


In his spirit space, the Heavenly Corpse Talisman drifted towards his spirit.


Qin Sang shuddered, just as he burst into the Ice Palace.


*Bang!*


Qin Sang hit the ground, his vision blacking out momentarily. A bluish-black ghostly hand filled his sight.


Fortunately, the hand stopped abruptly before his forehead.  Through the fingers, he saw the struggle in the Flying Night Rakshasa’s eyes – Wu Shang's lingering will was preventing it from striking.


*Whoosh… whoosh…*


A gale howled through the passage, black flames roaring as Yu Hua pursued.


The Flying Night Rakshasa twisted its neck to look, then vanished.


Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, sensing himself; his consciousness was unaffected by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.


There was no time for a thorough examination.


Qin Sang sprang up, rushing towards the side chamber where Yun Youzi had entered. He hadn’t gone far when he heard the shattering of glass behind him, followed by Yu Hua’s enraged roar.


Turning his head, Qin Sang inwardly groaned.


As expected, Yu Hua had been attacked by the Flying Night Rakshasa. But at the critical moment, a heart-protecting amulet-like artifact flew out from Yu Hua's chest.


This artifact not only protected its owner automatically but also possessed incredibly strong defensive capabilities. Though shattered by the Flying Night Rakshasa, it had blocked the fatal attack!


Yu Hua was unharmed.


"Who's there!"


Yu Hua was shocked to have his protective artifact shattered by the Rakshasa's claw.  He quickly realized the creature wasn't human.


The corpse poison clinging to the Rakshasa's claws caused him to gasp, thankful for the artifact's protection.


"How could a Flying Night Rakshasa be here?"


In the cultivation world, a Nascent Soul-level corpse was called a Flying Night Rakshasa, renowned for its formidable strength and elusiveness.  Naturally occurring zombies evolving into Flying Night Rakshasa was extremely rare, the conditions incredibly harsh, far exceeding the difficulty of a human cultivator reaching the Nascent Soul stage.


Yu Hua never expected one to be hidden here.


Noticing Qin Sang disappearing into the side chamber, Yu Hua was astonished. Why had the Flying Night Rakshasa attacked him instead of Qin Sang, who had initially disturbed it?


Could this Flying Night Rakshasa be Qin Sang's corpse puppet?


He shook his head. A Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivator couldn’t possibly control a Flying Night Rakshasa-level puppet.  Even if he had one, he wouldn't be able to control it.


Unless, there was a secret he didn't know.


The Flying Night Rakshasa gave Yu Hua no time to ponder. After missing its attack, it vanished and reappeared behind him.


Yu Hua felt a premonition of danger and dodged hastily.


The two figures clashed.


Yu Hua fought desperately to evade the Rakshasa, finally understanding its terrifying power. In just a few exchanges since the initial attack, he'd been on the brink of death several times, leaving him exhausted and drenched in cold sweat.


"Nine Nether Demon Flames!"


Yu Hua seized an opportunity, glaring at the oncoming Rakshasa. He roared, unleashing a torrent of black flames from his Ten Directions Yama Banner, intent on engulfing it.


The ghostly claw recoiled at the contact with the flames. The Rakshasa shrieked in pain, leaping back, its gaze fixed on the Ten Directions Yama Banner.  Its dark eyes showed intense fear.


Yu Hua was surprised by the Flying Night Rakshasa's fear of the Nine Nether Demon Flame.  He sneered, "A mere corpse-demon dares to be arrogant before me!"

Before he finished speaking, the Flying Night Rakshasa vanished again. Yu Hua's sneer disappeared, and he looked around, finding nothing unusual. He coldly snorted, then activated the Nine Nether Demon Flame, forming a protective shield around himself.

Simultaneously, he dispersed some of the flame into countless illusory sparks, scattering them around.

The next moment, Yu Hua abruptly turned towards a seemingly empty space and roared, "Show yourself!"


...

The living corpse, left outside by Qin Sang, witnessed everything.

Qin Sang wasn't surprised by the outcome.  Even the threads of the Ten Directions Yama Formation had some effect on the Flying Night Rakshasa. The Nine Nether Demon Flame, infinitely stronger, was likely its nemesis.

His guess proved correct.  This demonic flame was exceptionally powerful, unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen.  Yu Hua lacked the strength to kill the Rakshasa, but using the flame to keep it at bay was achievable.

However, if Yu Hua were to fully understand the Rakshasa and turn his attention to Qin Sang, it would be disastrous.  The Rakshasa's fear and constraint due to the flame meant Yu Hua wasn't in immediate danger.  Given this situation, Qin Sang dared not, and could not, interfere.

Qin Sang's spiritual energy was critically depleted. He had relied on medicinal pills to continue fighting, resulting in severe injuries to his energy sea and meridians. He was at his limit.

He quickly took a healing pill. Until his injuries recovered, he couldn't take more pills or absorb spirit stones to replenish his energy; otherwise, he'd risk exploding.

Suppressing his anxiety, Qin Sang examined the small chamber.  He finally understood why Yun Youzi needed him to buy time.

At the far end of the chamber, instead of an ice wall, was a barrier of restrictions, obscuring a pitch-black space.  To enter, he needed to break the barrier.

Qin Sang suddenly glanced toward the ice hall – the living corpse outside had been destroyed by Yu Hua!

Sure enough, Yu Hua was quickly learning the Rakshasa's weaknesses and was pursuing it here.

It wasn't a hopeless situation. He had a plan, but needed more time and a quiet environment to recover and prepare.

"Five Elements Breaking Formation Swords!"

Qin Sang summoned five spirit swords.  Years of training had greatly improved his skill in breaking formations. While not as fast as Yun Youzi, he could manage it without difficulty.
