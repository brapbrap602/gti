<h1>Chapter 950: Trial by Ordeal Once More</h1><p>After finding the teleportation formation on the fifth floor and entering the sixth, Qin Sang became noticeably more cautious.</p><p>The puppets on the sixth floor were the strongest yet, but they no longer served to hone his swordsmanship. After a flurry of effortless strikes, Qin Sang finally located the solitary, drifting teleportation formation.</p><p>In the darkness, a deathly silence surrounded the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang approached carefully, stepped onto the formation, and with a flash of light, appeared on the seventh floor, his eyes falling upon the ruined mountain peak.</p><p>Taking in his surroundings, Qin Sang felt a sense of relief.  This floor, like the previous six, was devoid of any human presence.</p><p>“Could it be that those Nascent Soul cultivators haven't come to the Celestial Tower?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, glancing at the Corpse Puppet Sack. "Fellow Daoist, have you recalled anything?" he asked.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Bai's voice emanated from within the sack.</p><p>Qin Sang was disappointed. If Bai could remember the secrets of the Celestial Tower, it might help him find the ancient teleportation formation and cultivation techniques.</p><p>But he couldn't fault Bai for not remembering.</p><p>After surveying the area, Qin Sang paused in thought.  With a flicker, his figure vanished into thin air, having activated some sort of concealment technique as he silently swept upwards.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang noticed a disturbance in a restriction, suspecting it might have been triggered. However, he chose not to investigate.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang reached the mountainside. Just as he was about to continue his ascent, his ears twitched, catching a strange sound. His expression shifted slightly, and he accelerated his pace, swiftly passing dozens of mountain fragments until he reached the massive fragment containing the valley.</p><p>He glanced left and right, then slipped into a cluster of boulders, his gaze fixed on the valley.</p><p>The seventh floor of the Celestial Tower had no further upward teleportation formation.</p><p>The space within the Celestial Tower was a pocket dimension created by a unique restriction. Many speculated that these seven floors were only a part of the tower, but countless cultivators had come and gone, unable to find the entrance to the eighth floor.</p><p>Many focused their attention on unusual locations, particularly this valley.</p><p>The black silken threads of the restriction within the valley were extremely dangerous, forcing even late Nascent Soul cultivators to keep their distance. No one knew what lay beyond the restriction.</p><p>It was widely believed that the teleportation formation was hidden within.</p><p>The previous conflict between the Great Shaman and the Demon Lord was said to have been over an ancient treasure, likely obtained from the valley.  At this moment, Qin Sang was surprised to see several figures hovering outside the valley, cautiously peering inside.</p><p>From within the valley, powerful fluctuations emanated intermittently.</p><p>“Could it be that those Nascent Soul cultivators are actually trying to break the black silk restriction?”</p><p>Qin Sang speculated inwardly. He glanced at the figures outside the valley, a sneer playing on his lips. "These people are truly audacious, attempting to scavenge under the noses of the two clans' Nascent Soul cultivators. They're courting death!"</p><p>He had no intention of joining the fray. Seeing that nothing would happen in the valley for the time being, he slightly altered his course and soon arrived at the entrance to the Sword Path.</p><p>No one would be interested in a completely decayed and collapsed ancient temple.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Celestial Eye Butterfly to keep watch. After confirming that no one was observing, he first set up a concealing restriction, then summoned the Ebony Sword and used its Qi to open the entrance.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang flashed into the Sword Path.</p><p>Paved with green bricks, the Sword Path remained unchanged from his last visit.</p><p>Before leaving the Sword Path last time, he had copied the contents of Senior Qing Zhu's jade slip and returned the original to its place.</p><p>Now, the jade slip still lay undisturbed.</p><p>Senior Qing Zhu's handwriting conveyed his unwillingness to accept his fate.</p><p>"Life is unpredictable... I never thought this would be Senior Qing Zhu's final testament."</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the words, a melancholic expression on his face.</p><p>He had heard countless legends about Senior Qing Zhu, and it was a great regret that they never met.  He had finally found Senior Qing Zhu's dojo, only to learn that he had been besieged by enemies and his fate was uncertain.</p><p>Collecting his thoughts, Qin Sang walked to the front of the Sword Path, his expression solemn.  The success of his plan to have his sword soul-forged avatar recognized by the Sword Path hinged on this moment.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The avatar emerged from the Celestial Corpse Coffin and stood beside Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had already retrieved the magical treasures from his avatar, as they were likely unusable within the Sword Path.</p><p>“When I enter the Sword Path, the Corpse Puppet Sack might be sealed, don't worry...”</p><p>Qin Sang explained the situation of the Sword Path to Bai.</p><p>Bai’s voice came from the Corpse Puppet Sack. “This Sword Path, coupled with the puppets on the previous six floors, truly resembles a training ground used by a certain sect to train its disciples. If the restrictions within the Sword Path are as miraculous as you say, this sect is not simple. It's a pity I don't remember anything…”</p><p>Qin Sang chatted with Bai for a few moments, then beckoned his avatar and stepped into the Sword Path.</p><p>After walking a zhang, a strange phenomenon occurred.</p><p>The passage suddenly brightened, and a large mass of cyan light appeared above, descending without warning.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. He was ready to rescue his avatar at any moment.  He had expended so much effort to cultivate a peak Core Formation avatar and didn't want to lose it here.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The cyan light, carrying a terrifying pressure, was about to descend upon them when, as if sensing something, it silently dissipated.  The familiar scene repeated itself as the remaining cyan lights rushed towards Qin Sang, sealing all his treasures except for the Ebony Sword.</p><p>To Qin Sang's great delight, his avatar remained unharmed by his side.</p><p>"Senior Qing Zhu left behind the *Seed Devil Fetus* for a reason! This demonic avatar cultivation technique allows those who inherit it to pass the Sword Path trial before reaching the Nascent Soul stage.  Otherwise, unless one cultivates both body and Dharma like me, one would probably need to comprehend Sword Momentum and manifest a Sword Formation to withstand the siege of two top-tier swordsmen..."</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed, his worries completely dispelled.</p><p>At this moment, the green bricks on both sides of the passage lit up, and two familiar spectral swordsmen emerged. They bowed deeply to Qin Sang before launching their attack.</p><p>Qin Sang, in high spirits, returned the bow before ordering his avatar to engage.</p><p>The avatar had no magical treasures, but its cultivation base was sufficient to easily suppress the swordsmen.</p><p>After a few exchanges, the swordsmen were forced into a corner and conceded defeat.</p><p>"You, protect me!"</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, instructing his avatar before summoning the Ebony Sword and stepping forward.</p><p>Just as he had done before, he wanted to immerse himself in the battle with the swordsmen, continuing to comprehend and refine his swordsmanship, elevating his sword dao cultivation.  With his avatar guarding him, he could be more focused and unrestrained, knowing that the avatar could intervene if he showed any signs of defeat.</p><p>He didn't know if he would ever return to this place, so he couldn't miss this precious opportunity.</p><p>He believed that this trial would greatly benefit him. Even if he couldn't comprehend Sword Momentum, he could still enhance the power of his Sword Wheel.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The moment the two swordsmen appeared, they were pierced through the chest by Qin Sang's sword and returned to the green bricks.</p><p>His strength had greatly increased, and he no longer saw the initial swordsmen as a challenge.  He quickly progressed through the trial, effortlessly traversing a small portion of the Sword Path.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang reached the point where he had stopped last time.  The relaxed expression on his face faded slightly, and he suppressed a portion of his cultivation before taking another step.</p>
