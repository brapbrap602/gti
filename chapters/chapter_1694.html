<h1>Chapter 1685: True Spirit Reversal, Three Corpses Burning Spirit</h1><p>Su Zinan casually tossed out a ball of light gauze. The gauze unfurled, revealing itself to be the dragon sinew net Su Zinan habitually used. Previously shrunk and stowed away, it had now changed form. Strands of dragon sinew woven into a net, once spread open, resembled a chessboard. As its luster shimmered, illusory dragons and serpents seemed to swim across its surface, their forms fierce and imposing.  Su Zinan was clearly prepared. Almost the instant the Heavenly Thunder appeared, the dragon sinew net was already deployed, rapidly expanding above his head.  The net tautened with a铮铮 sound, resembling the ringing of swords.  Spiritual mist churned, and the dragon-serpent illusions raised their heads.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Heavenly Thunder descended with the force of a collapsing mountain.  The spiritual mist instantly dispersed, pierced straight through by the Heavenly Thunder. The dragon-serpent illusions shattered.  A deep pit was gouged into the center of the dragon sinew net. The power of the Heavenly Thunder erupted across the net, countless threads of lightning spreading outwards along the dragon sinew meridians, transforming it into a net of lightning.  The dragon sinews, as if possessing a life of their own, spasmed under the impact of the Heavenly Thunder. The net twisted into a ball, encasing the Heavenly Thunder's power within.</p><p>Su Zinan, ignoring the changes above him, shifted his gaze to the streak of escaping light, fast as lightning, and chuckled darkly. "So, this is your avatar!"</p><p>He recognized Qin Sang's avatar.  Years ago, the avatar had visited Elder Yanshan, only to later turn against him on the snowy plains and divide the Water Aspect Master’s legacy.</p><p>After capturing Elder Yanshan, Su Zinan recognized the avatar's origins and learned of its connection to the Fire Devil, with whom it had collaborated on the snowy plains.</p><p>The Fire Devil had blocked Old Wu outside the tomb.</p><p>Yuefei had 'died' at the hands of the avatar.</p><p>One inside, one outside, their coordination seamless. Had Elder Yanshan not been superior in skill, they likely wouldn't have escaped the tomb with a single treasure.</p><p>Their simultaneous appearance at Emperor Bestowment Mountain further cemented their relationship.</p><p>It was precisely because of the Fire Devil's presence that Su Zinan had decided to act now.</p><p>From their previous encounters, he could see that the Fire Devil had almost no weaknesses and was an extremely formidable opponent. Su Zinan had already abandoned the idea of imprisoning the Fire Devil's Nascent Soul.</p><p>He considered the Fire Devil a powerful rival. If the avatar and the Fire Devil were to join forces, and the Five Elements Elixir fell into the Fire Devil's hands, it would be nearly impossible for anyone else to claim it.</p><p>The Fire Devil was nowhere to be seen, perhaps frightened away, or perhaps lurking in the shadows.</p><p>The avatar would never have imagined someone daring to snatch the Five Elements Elixir right under a Nascent Soul cultivator's nose. This was the moment when their guard was down, the moment with the highest chance of success.</p><p>However, Su Zinan hadn't anticipated such a close connection between them.</p><p>Cultivated from an orthodox profound sect lineage, the avatar, despite its limitations, possessed a naturally harmonious Qi and profound magical powers, far surpassing ordinary unorthodox secret techniques.</p><p>The avatar appearing alone could even deceive Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Of course, they might have been preoccupied with the demonic body and hadn't thoroughly investigated the avatar's origins.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't fathom the abilities of Nascent Soul cultivators and had been somewhat apprehensive, worried that the avatar's true nature wouldn't escape their discerning eyes.</p><p>Even with Old Wu and Elder Yanshan’s memories, having 'seen' both the avatar and the original body, Su Zinan would still find it difficult to connect them.</p><p>Now, with the situation urgent, Qin Sang couldn't and didn't need to conceal anything further. With both the original body and avatar appearing, Su Zinan sensed the faint thread of Qi connecting them and instantly understood.</p><p>"Courting death!"</p><p>Qin Sang roared.</p><p>Within the escaping light, Qin Sang's gaze held a world-shaking killing intent, like two sharp swords, piercing Su Zinan’s eyes.</p><p>Su Zinan sneered, dismissing Qin Sang's threat, and retorted, "A Nascent Soul late-stage original body, plus an avatar wielding a spiritual treasure, yet still outmaneuvered by that old ghost Yanshan, allowing him to steal the Water Aspect legacy and escape unscathed. Calling you trash wouldn't be an exaggeration…"</p><p>His taunting was interrupted by a streak of sword light.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword arrived, faster than Qin Sang’s original body.</p><p>Its sharp, urgent cry seemed influenced by its master's rage.</p><p>Having witnessed the power of Qin Sang's sword array, Su Zinan's expression grew serious. Before the Golden Sinking Sword could approach, his intent summoned the black ruler, which had been relentlessly attacking the sword star.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ruler’s shadows converged.  The black ruler shifted direction, its body tilting slightly to meet the Golden Sinking Sword.  Clusters of black light erupted from the black ruler, explosions rivaling thunder.  The black light resembled blossoming demonic thunder flowers, their aura as violent as a thunderstorm.</p><p>Wherever it passed, demonic thunder flowers bloomed continuously, dense black threads spreading through the surrounding void.</p><p>It appeared as if the void itself was being shattered by the black ruler.</p><p>As the black ruler moved, its momentum built layer upon layer. The ruler itself vanished, leaving only a black sun and a massive halo radiating outwards.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Sword light like a rainbow, piercing the sun!</p><p>A point of light appeared at the center of the black sun, and then the entire black sun shattered from the middle, revealing the black ruler within.</p><p>By then, the Golden Sinking Sword had vanished.  At some point, the void had grown dim, filled with crisscrossing sword threads. The sword array, merged with the sun’s halo, relentlessly attacked the black ruler's power.</p><p>Accompanied by a metallic clang, the black ruler trembled violently, shadows of the ruler scattering like rain in all directions.</p><p>Su Zinan intentionally allowed the Golden Sinking Sword to enter, the black ruler's sun halo locked in a deadly embrace with the sword array. Though the halo was battered by the sword array, it held its form, relentlessly entangling its opponent, regardless of the cost.</p><p>Everything was proceeding as planned. Su Zinan, indifferent to these developments, had already shifted his gaze, fixing it upon the sword star, his eyes seemingly piercing through the starlight to the avatar hidden within.</p><p>He had no interest in Qin Sang's Nascent Soul.  Firstly, Qin Sang was too powerful. Secondly, the threat of the Nascent Soul cultivator loomed overhead.  Engaging in a protracted battle with Qin Sang here was unwise.</p><p>His sole objective was the Five Elements Elixir!</p><p>Relying on the spiritual treasure, divine light, and the sword star’s sword intent, the avatar, for the time being, managed to withstand the combined assault from Su Zinan and the two demonic souls.</p><p>Su Zinan glanced at the two demonic souls and narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>While engaging Qin Sang's original body in a distant confrontation, his actions never ceased. The blood Qi between him and the two souls grew increasingly dense, its stench overpowering.</p><p>The intense blood light became blinding, even eclipsing the brilliance of the sword star.</p><p>The blood Qi formed a triangle, with Su Zinan's original body and the two demonic souls at its vertices.  The demonic banner stood beside Su Zinan. The dimmed sword star resembled a lone boat adrift on a sea of blood, on the verge of capsizing.</p><p>Creating such a spectacle, Su Zinan naturally had a purpose. Though the naked eye couldn't penetrate the blood Qi, the growing power within could be felt.</p><p>Su Zinan glanced sideways, giving Qin Sang’s original body a ferocious grin, and struck the demonic banner with his palm.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The Three Corpses Death God Banner fluttered.</p><p>The banner unfurled, and a faceless head flew out.</p><p>This was the third demonic soul, yet to be fused with a Nascent Soul.</p><p>Forced out of the demonic banner, facing its master and two fully formed companions, despite its lack of a face, its fear was palpable.</p><p>The dense blood Qi made it tremble, shrinking back in terror.</p><p>Su Zinan snorted, a strange syllable escaping his throat. The faceless demonic soul was instantly immobilized, unable to struggle, floating towards Su Zinan.</p><p>In the next moment, a streak of light shot out from the crown of Su Zinan’s head. His Nascent Soul left his body, paused briefly, and then lunged towards the faceless demonic soul.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Nascent Soul merged, and the faceless demonic soul let out a shrill shriek, its face bulging outwards.</p><p>Then the shriek ceased, features forming, identical to Su Zinan’s.</p><p>True Spirit Reversal, Three Corpses United!</p><p>Su Zinan, reborn as a demonic soul, stood beside his original body, close to the demonic banner, his eyes slightly lowered, gazing not at the sword star but at the churning blood Qi.</p><p>Under his gaze, the blood Qi abruptly calmed, becoming still. Then, streaks of blood light emerged within the Qi, the three outermost streaks particularly thick and prominent.</p><p>The three streaks connected to the three demonic souls, forming a triangular blood formation.</p><p>Within, denser blood threads, thick and thin, outlined various ghostly and bloody figures, grotesque and bizarre, a hundred times more hideous and terrifying than any legendary demon or monster.</p><p>The sword star was situated at the center of the blood formation, surrounded by countless ghostly figures, as if thrown from a river of blood into an endless hell, its light tainted by the evil.</p><p>"Burning Spirit!"</p><p>Su Zinan's demonic soul shrieked.</p><p>Su Zinan’s voice could still be heard in the shriek, though it sounded somewhat ethereal.</p><p>Old Wu’s and Elder Yanshan’s demonic souls roared in unison.</p><p>Instantly, blood light soared to the heavens.</p><p>This was Su Zinan's most powerful blood magic, the Burning Spirit Blood Sacrifice.</p><p>This technique shared a lineage with the cultivation methods he and Old Wu practiced, but it wasn't originally part of their methods. It was deduced and passed down to Su Zinan by Old Demon Lu.</p><p>Old Demon Lu’s foundation wasn't in the way of blood, but he understood the principle of drawing inferences by analogy and was deeply interested in the way of blood.  He enslaved Old Wu precisely because he saw Old Wu’s talent and its potential to validate his demonic arts.</p><p>In reality, Old Demon Lu and Old Wu’s relationship was both master-servant and teacher-student.</p><p>With Old Wu’s rapid advancement, Old Demon Lu perfected his demonic arts and thus deduced the Burning Spirit Blood Sacrifice, this grand magical technique.</p><p>Su Zinan cultivated a method that combined Old Demon Lu’s demonic arts and Old Wu’s blood magic. Because he received more guidance from Old Wu, it leaned more towards Old Wu’s blood magic. However, even with his current cultivation, performing the Burning Spirit Blood Sacrifice was extremely taxing and required the Three Corpses Death God Banner.</p><p>If all three souls were complete, it would be much easier.</p><p>With two souls, it could still be performed, albeit with difficulty.</p><p>However, with incomplete souls, the True Spirit Reversal step was necessary. Without prior preparation, he could only use it as he was now, with the opponent trapped within the sword star, to ensure absolute success.</p><p>True Spirit Reversal would also weaken him and his demonic souls, so it couldn't be used casually.</p><p>In his previous encounters with Mo Xingdao, Su Zinan had repeatedly tried to trap him, but Mo Xingdao’s puppet escape technique was too potent, and he had always failed, unable to find an opportunity for the Burning Spirit Blood Sacrifice.</p><p>Now, to seize the Five Elements Elixir, Su Zinan held nothing back!</p><p>Three souls united, the blood formation complete.</p><p>Within the blinding blood light, the outline of the blood formation became increasingly distinct. The ghostly blood figures within seemed to come alive, scrambling towards the sword star in the center.</p><p>The sword star was no longer visible. A massive blood bubble appeared at the center of the formation, constantly bombarded by terrifying forces, explosions echoing from within.</p><p>Witnessing this scene, Qin Sang's original body's eyes turned bloodshot. Protected by the罡fire shield, he instantly broke through the black ruler’s sun halo.  With a raised hand, red light flashed, and the Sun God Tree spiraled upwards, shining brilliantly.</p><p>Su Zinan’s demonic soul growled.</p><p>The three demonic souls below trembled violently, transforming into three streaks of soul light, shooting towards the top of the blood formation.</p><p>The soul lights converged abruptly, morphing into a giant tens of zhang tall.</p><p>The giant’s features were disharmonious. Closer inspection revealed a resemblance to Su Zinan, yet traces of Old Wu and Elder Yanshan could also be discerned. The three demonic souls' features were fused together, creating a grotesque visage.</p><p>The giant's body wasn't solid, appearing somewhat illusory like the demonic souls, resembling a specter.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The giant opened its eyes, glaring at Qin Sang’s original body. Its pupils reflected a piercing point of firelight, the reflection of the Sun God Tree.</p><p>The Burning Spirit Blood Sacrifice was complete. The sword star was engulfed in blood light, and distorted, grotesque shadows appeared on the blood bubble at the center.</p><p>The pressure on the avatar instantly surged to a terrifying degree.</p><p>With the Five Elements Elixir almost within his grasp, Su Zinan wouldn't allow Qin Sang's original body to interfere.  The giant took a step forward, blocking Qin Sang, as if looking down at an ant.  It raised a finger and swiped downwards.</p><p>Faint blood light flickered from its fingertip, leaving a distinct blood streak in the void.</p><p>The blood streak appeared to open a gate to a blood hell in the void, shooting towards the Sun God Tree at incredible speed, endless blood pouring from the streak.</p><p>Su Zinan intended to strike first.</p><p>Though he hadn't experienced it personally, he had witnessed the Sun God Bird's power several times and had a general understanding of its might. Even if this attack couldn't repel Qin Sang, it could definitely hinder the Sun God Bird.</p><p>He only needed a fleeting moment to breach the sword star and capture Qin Sang's avatar.</p><p>The Sun God Tree radiated light, Southern Brightly Fire coursing along its trunk, ultimately converging at its crown, coalescing into the Sun God Bird.</p><p>Facing the encroaching blood streak, the Sun God Tree's radiance didn't diminish in the slightest. Instead, contrasted against the blood light, it appeared even more vibrant and dazzling, the divine bird lifelike.</p><p>The tree trembled slightly, and the divine bird spread its wings.</p><p>The giant's gaze narrowed.</p><p>Suddenly, an unexpected change occurred. A sharp cry emanated from within Qin Sang, clearly not originating from him, but from his dantian!</p><p>Within the dantian, the Cloud Roaming Sword’s intent had been working with the poison pearl to suppress the Gu King.</p><p>Suddenly, both lost control.</p><p>The sword intent abruptly intensified, disrupting the balance.  To the Gu King, this felt like an attempt on its life.  Startled awake, it instinctively retaliated, spewing venomous light.</p><p>The venomous light erupted within Qin Sang's dantian.</p><p>This was undoubtedly a risky move, but Qin Sang had preemptively activated the poison pearl to protect himself, hoping to weaken the venom's power.</p><p>Under his deliberate guidance, the venomous light erupted towards the giant.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The giant demonic soul, braced for the Sun God Bird, was caught off guard by the venomous light erupting from Qin Sang without warning.  Struck by the potent venom, its body momentarily stiffened.</p><p>Having witnessed the strange-faced man’s death firsthand, and with Lu Zhang’s experience, Qin Sang knew that the Gu King’s venom could harm souls, but he wasn't certain how much damage it could inflict on the combined form of the three demonic souls.</p><p>Of course, his goal wasn't to poison the demonic souls, but to exploit the moment the venom entered their bodies, slowing their reactions and creating an opportunity for himself!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Sun God Tree erupted with unprecedentedly bright flames. The fire bird spread its wings and took flight.</p><p>Not three, but six!</p><p>Six fire birds emerged at once!</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang’s True Essence drained like a bursting dam, leaving him utterly weakened.</p><p>Su Zinan forcefully suppressed the venom within the giant's body, only to see the blood streak devoured by a burst of flames.</p>
