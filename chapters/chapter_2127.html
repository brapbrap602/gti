<h1>Chapter 2117: The Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram</h1><p>Within the imperial carriage, a painted scroll hung suspended in mid-air, depicting the locations and terrain of the major regions within the Storm Realm. Min Zhuo entered, overhearing King Lu and his advisors discussing their strategy of attack.</p><p>After listening quietly for a moment, King Lu turned to him and inquired, "Clan Leader Min Zhuo, you have battled these foreign races for many years. What strategies do you propose? Speak freely." The Grand Preceptor, Lu Gan, and several of King Lu's generals all turned their gaze towards Min Zhuo. Only the Grand Tutor remained aloof, eyes closed, seemingly oblivious to the proceedings.</p><p>Min Zhuo maintained his composure, his mind racing.</p><p>The Storm Realm could be broadly divided into three regions. Considering the Eastern Sea, Middle Continent, and Western Lands as a single entity, they formed the Middle Continent landmass, the undisputed heart of the Storm Realm. The other two regions were considered remote territories.</p><p>He had just overheard some of Lu Gan's faction advocating for dividing their forces into three armies, led respectively by King Lu, the Grand Preceptor, and the Grand Tutor, launching a simultaneous assault on the three major regions.</p><p>So far, there had been no sign of reinforcements from elsewhere for the foreign races. The Si You Clan army held an absolute advantage.</p><p>The most crucial factor was the unknown number of Void Refinement experts on the opposing side. As long as the Si You Clan could deploy individuals to engage them, allowing the main army to advance relentlessly, they would have the opportunity to sweep through the enemy and decisively settle the conflict.</p><p>Having lost both territory and morale, the Void Refinement experts would surely be disheartened. Then, they could devise strategies to defeat them individually.</p><p>However, the Grand Tutor had not expressed his opinion on this matter, and the foreign races’ rapid retreat did not align with Min Zhuo's interests.</p><p>He stepped forward, acknowledging the king with a "Yes," and pointed to a location on the sea chart, recounting the events of several previous battles. "...A Shifting Formation connects the Northern Sea and the Middle Continent landmass, allowing them to reinforce each other swiftly. Only that region, which the foreigners call the Boundless Sea and the Demon Sea, is the most remote. Back then, our clan targeted this area and successfully occupied this sea region, only to have it wrestled back from us. However..."</p><p>Min Zhuo's tone shifted, "Previously, I had not yet reached my current cultivation level, and the enemy did not possess any Void Refinement experts. Our past experiences cannot be directly applied to the present situation.  Back then, the strategy of securing one region before expanding, gradually encroaching upon the enemy, was viable. Now, the strength of these foreign races is unfathomable, and there are also these Altars that have never appeared before. That True Person Qin likely doesn't value the gain or loss of a single region; it might even be a trap."</p><p>King Lu appeared contemplative. "Clan Leader Min Zhuo's meaning is that if we divide our forces, it would play into the enemy's hands, and we would be defeated piecemeal?"</p><p>"These are merely my speculations; there's no concrete evidence."</p><p>Min Zhuo bowed slightly. "The intelligence reports continuously sent from each region coincide with Grand Preceptor Lu Gan's personal reconnaissance.  Those foreign races are simultaneously constructing countless Altars across all major regions. If these Altars all belong to a single Altar Formation, with all three regions within the formation, the person controlling the formation, seated at the main Altar, can direct the formation's divine power to any location.  Attacking any region would be the same.  Thus, dividing our forces would be equivalent to voluntarily weakening our own strength, while the enemy can concentrate their power through the Altar Formation. In this scenario, we might face a situation where the enemy is strong and we are weak!"</p><p>After a pause, he added, "Of course, this is predicated on the assumption that they are constructing an offensive formation! If the Altars are only defensive and not offensive, then it's nothing more than a turtle shell, and not a cause for concern!"</p><p>King Lu chuckled. "Clan Leader Min Zhuo's thoughts align perfectly with the Grand Preceptor's. The current priority is to ascertain the true nature of these Altars."</p><p>Min Zhuo responded with a humble, "You flatter me, Your Majesty. The Grand Preceptor surely has a far-reaching plan. My shallow words are but a jest before such wisdom."</p><p>King Lu waved his hand, turning his gaze to the sea chart. Then, he pointed his finger towards the Western Lands, his voice resounding with determination. "In that case, we shall march directly to their doorstep! Our target is this place!"</p><p>Everyone responded in unison, "Your command is our will!"</p><p>Lu Gan stated coldly, "I've been eager for another encounter with that True Person Qin! I only hope that the Altars aren't just for show, a cover for their escape!"</p><p>"If they intended to flee, they wouldn't have waited until now," the Grand Preceptor shook his head slightly, stepping forward to take King Lu's place in deploying the troops.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor did not assign any tasks to the Grand Tutor. After several attempts to gauge his stance during the journey, the Grand Tutor's attitude had become abundantly clear.</p><p>Lu Gan and the others accepted their orders and departed.</p><p>The army mobilized, advancing directly towards the Western Lands, their imposing aura unconcealed, causing the very heavens and earth to change color wherever they passed.</p><p>King Lu nodded with satisfaction, exchanging a glance with the Grand Preceptor. The Grand Preceptor turned and bowed towards the Grand Tutor. "We shall reach the Western Lands shortly. When does Grand Tutor intend to deploy the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram?"</p><p>The Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram was the formation diagram that King Lu had requested from the Si You Emperor.</p><p>Rumored to possess immense power, King Lu had requested it specifically to counter the enemy's Altar Formation.  Should the enemy launch a surprise attack, this diagram would offer protection, preventing them from suffering heavy losses from being caught off guard.</p><p>The imperial family regarded the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram as a priceless treasure. Although the Si You Emperor had agreed to lend it, it had to be personally wielded by the Grand Tutor.</p><p>The Grand Tutor lifted his eyelids, his demeanor languid. "Oh? We are to deploy the diagram before even encountering the enemy?"</p><p>"Deploying the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram in advance will allow us to respond promptly should any unforeseen circumstances arise. Waiting until we are at the front lines might be too late to unfurl it. This battle will not be decided overnight. We require the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram to create a secure rear, stabilize morale, so we can advance steadily, gradually forcing the enemy to reveal their true strength.  His Majesty's request for this diagram from the Emperor was precisely for this moment. Moreover...it is said that the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram is not easily deployed. After being unfurled, its aura is immense, but its power does not immediately reach its peak. It requires continuous refinement, gradually increasing its potency. Is this true or false?"</p><p>Although the Grand Preceptor's latter words were framed as a question, his tone was extremely certain.</p><p>The Grand Tutor's eyes flickered. "Unexpectedly, Grand Preceptor is so knowledgeable about the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram, even aware of these secrets. Truly well-informed, worthy of someone who emerged from *that* place!"</p><p>Hearing these words, Yuan Miao and Min Zhuo couldn't help but glance sideways, secretly speculating about the place the Grand Tutor had mentioned.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor chuckled softly, his expression unaffected, his eyes fixed on the Grand Tutor's sleeves.</p><p>"Very well!"</p><p>The Grand Tutor rose to his feet. A faint, ethereal light flickered from his sleeves as he produced a small, ochre-yellow scroll.</p><p>In the next instant, the Grand Tutor appeared outside the imperial carriage. With a flick of his sleeve, the scroll radiated a brilliant light, slowly unfolding.</p><p>A rich, ochre-yellow light emanated from the scroll, filling the sky and earth. The surrounding flying ships and cultivators were all bathed in a layer of yellow light.</p><p>The scroll hovered before the Grand Tutor, its surface shimmering with spiritual light. The images within the scroll were not static, displaying a variety of mystical scenes, resembling mountains yet not mountains, resembling water yet not water.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after deploying the scroll, the Grand Tutor ceased his actions, turning his gaze towards the vast sea. King Lu and the others did not urge him, patiently waiting.</p><p>After flying for a short distance, a shadowy mass appeared on the surface of the sea ahead—an island.</p><p>The island was lush with vegetation, devoid of any human presence.</p><p>The Grand Tutor's expression shifted subtly. The scroll flew towards the island, flipping over when it reached the sky above, its image facing downwards, bathing the entire island in ochre-yellow light.</p><p>Then, an astonishing scene unfolded. As the ochre-yellow light spread, the island began to "melt." The earth and stone softened, flowing down from the mountaintops and the ground as if a mudslide had occurred. Soon, all the peaks and hills on the island dissolved, and the entire island was melting, like an island of flowing sand. Only the vegetation did not sink into the ground, but flowed along with the earth.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, a yellow light suddenly surged from the island, shooting towards the scroll.  The earth and stone on the island followed the yellow light, flowing upwards, continuously being devoured by the scroll. In the blink of an eye, half the island had vanished, as if the scroll contained infinite space. The devouring continued.</p><p>Finally, the entire island disappeared without a trace, the seawater filling the void, leaving no sign of its existence.</p><p>The scroll swiftly returned, the ochre-yellow light on its surface becoming even more intense. Looking at the image now, a mysterious ochre-yellow wind swirled within.</p><p>The Grand Tutor's hand seals changed rapidly, striking out several consecutive incantations. The ochre-yellow wind spiraled upwards, transforming into a raging gale that filled the sky.</p><p>The void was shrouded in a hazy yellow.</p><p>Cultivators with profound cultivation bases looked down in astonishment, discovering a landmass beneath them.</p><p>Clearly, this landmass was formed from the island absorbed by the scroll, but its area was several times larger, its crust thinner.</p><p>The army continued its advance. The Grand Tutor continuously activated the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram, absorbing countless islands. The army no longer needed to ride on flying ships, as they could now stand firmly on this massive landmass.</p><p>This was a landmass that could fly in the sky and float on the sea, large enough to accommodate everyone, and even faster than the flying ships!</p><p>The Grand Tutor finally ceased absorbing islands, pressing his palm downwards. The scroll trembled, sinking into the ground and vanishing without a trace.</p><p>He swept his gaze across the surroundings, a satisfied expression on his face. He retrieved a jade slip and handed it to the Grand Preceptor. "Deploy men to guard these marked locations, assisting me in absorbing the world's energy to further refine the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram. During the refinement process, I do not wish to be disturbed."</p><p>The Grand Preceptor responded seriously, "We understand the importance of this and will absolutely not disturb Grand Tutor!"</p><p>The Grand Tutor nodded, lightly tapping his foot, vanishing into thin air,遁入大地某处. embedding himself somewhere within the earth.</p><p>King Lu and the others surveyed their surroundings. The landmass was now a landscape of rolling hills, towering peaks, jagged rocks, and dense forests, appearing completely natural, with no trace of artificial creation.</p><p>The army arrayed themselves upon the landmass, awaiting orders.</p><p>It was as if they had brought their homeland with them, waging war with their home as their base.</p><p>...The boundless waters stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><p>A bird dived into the sea, catching a small fish. Just as it was about to return to the air, it was suddenly enveloped by a shadow.</p><p>The bird looked up, stunned by the sight before it, dropping its prey without realizing it.</p><p>A massive landmass was flying in the sky at an incredible speed, disappearing over the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p><p>"Your Majesty," Min Zhuo pointed ahead, "crossing this sea region will bring us to the Western Lands."</p><p>King Lu smiled faintly. "I wonder how the remnants of Yanshan, yearning for their lost home, intend to greet us."</p><p>Before he could finish his words, a muffled rumble of thunder echoed from the east.</p><p>Despite the clear skies and blazing sun, the thunder was clearly audible.  As it reached them, those with weaker cultivations felt their blood churn and their minds become uneasy.</p><p>King Lu and the others' expressions shifted slightly, their gazes fixed on the eastern horizon. Initially, they could only see the calm sky, devoid of any unusual phenomena.</p><p>As the army continued to advance, a change finally appeared in the sky. The eastern sky suddenly darkened.</p><p>The darkness was fleeting, instantly illuminated by dazzling lightning.  In the distance, they could see countless thunder dragons and lightning serpents dancing across the heavens, the might of the thunder transmitting across the vast distance.</p><p>This was no ordinary celestial thunder. The lightning coursed through the sky, potent but restrained, clearly manipulated by someone wielding powerful magic.</p><p>However, the scale of this spell was simply too immense. The horizon was a sea of silver, transformed into a realm of thunder, boundless and endless.</p><p>It was difficult to imagine the sheer amount of thunder contained within, and the terrifying power it would unleash once unleashed.</p><p>"It's the Thunder Altar!" the Grand Preceptor stated gravely. King Lu and the others' expressions grew even more solemn.</p><p>It was common knowledge that among all magical arts, thunder arts were the most ferocious.  Thunder arts used solely for defense were extremely rare.  The Altar Formation was most likely an offensive one!</p><p>Nothing ventured, nothing gained!</p><p>The Si You Clan army did not halt, maintaining their original speed, gradually approaching the realm of thunder.</p><p>As the thunder roared, a magnificent voice suddenly resonated, overpowering the thunder, echoing across the heavens and earth.</p><p>"Halt!"</p><p>King Lu looked towards the Grand Preceptor. The Grand Preceptor understood tacitly, activating his magic. The landmass immediately stopped, confronting the realm of thunder from afar.</p><p>Then, one of King Lu's subordinates shouted, "Who are you? Why do you block our path?!"</p><p>The other side did not answer, instead demanding sharply, "Who are you, daring to trespass upon this Daoist's domain?!"</p><p>"Hahahaha..." Lu Gan suddenly burst into laughter, stepping forward from the ranks.  "Are you, by chance, True Person Qin? Do you still remember this old man?  I have come today to fulfill the promise made that day."</p><p>The opposing voice responded coldly, "So it's you, a defeated opponent.  How dare you speak of courage!"</p><p>Lu Gan seethed inwardly, letting out a cold snort.  "You are on the verge of death yet remain unaware.  This old man offered you kind words of advice that day. You can still hand over that孽障. If you remain obstinate, today will be your last!"</p><p>The only response was a disdainful sneer.</p><p>Just then, a figure quietly appeared beside King Lu. The Grand Tutor had also emerged.</p><p>King Lu stopped Lu Gan from continuing his taunts, flying alone into the air and offering a respectful bow from afar.  "I am King Lu.  True Person Qin, why not show yourself and speak?"</p><p>Before his words faded, the thunderous realm on the opposite side churned, the lightning plasma coalescing into a human figure, identical in appearance to Qin Sang.</p><p>He casually bowed slightly, stating indifferently, "King Lu of the Han Jiang, I have long admired your name!  Your Majesty has personally led this expedition solely to subdue this humble Daoist?"</p><p>King Lu was not offended, instead letting out a majestic laugh.  "True Person Qin, you are free to withdraw at any time. We are here under the Emperor's decree to quell this rebellion. Whether we fight or make peace depends entirely on your attitude."</p><p>He then glanced at the space behind Qin Sang. "True Person Qin, you are not one of them. Why not invite the true master to come forth?  Or is it that the esteemed Young Master of Yanshan, as well as the esteemed Chief Attendant Xia, the foremost figure under King Yan, are now only willing to be cowards, too afraid to confront us directly?"</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's Dharma Body presided over the main Altar, with cultivators at all the branch Altars in their designated positions, collectively activating the Altar Formation.</p><p>The realm of thunder was a manifestation of a portion of the Altar Formation's power, but its true might remained concealed.</p><p>At the center of the realm of thunder, Qin Sang's true body stood side-by-side with a Featherblaze Bird, observing the situation outside.</p><p>The Featherblaze Bird was Si Lu's companion beast. Si Lu knew he could not avoid this confrontation and had long prepared to face it. However, provoked by King Lu's words, he couldn't help but feel a surge of anger, his frustration mounting.</p><p>Flames flickered across the Featherblaze Bird's body as it transformed into Si Lu's form, nodding at Qin Sang before flying to the front lines.</p>
