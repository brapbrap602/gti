<h1>Chapter 168 Death</h1><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The Trapping Skies Canopy came crashing down, carrying a fierce gale that reduced the shattered stone pillars and fragments on the ground to dust.</p><p>The Corpse Demon had just broken free from the spirit talisman and the vine artifact and was about to use an escape technique to flee when it was caught in the gale. The octagonal-shaped gale formation completely enveloped the Corpse Demon. The visible gale suddenly contracted, transforming into an icy blue tornado that rose from the ground and squeezed the Corpse Demon.</p><p>The gale formation churned up billows of smoke, like a blue-gray curtain that concealed the Corpse Demon within. The howl of the wind reverberated through the palace hall, deafening and accompanied by the Corpse Demon's incessant roars.</p><p>It seemed that the Corpse Demon had been trapped by the Trapping Skies Canopy.</p><p>Seeing that the Trapping Skies Canopy was indeed working, the three men relaxed a little. The face of White Cloud Mountain Master lit up, and he said, "I will suppress this demon, you two stay focused on attacking the center of the gale formation..."</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, there was a sudden muffled sound from the gale formation. The gale formation trembled violently as if it had been hit by a huge force, and several cracks appeared. Wisps of icy blue wind dissipated.</p><p>The Trapping Skies Canopy hovering in the air shook violently a few times as well, and began to sway.</p><p>Then, there was a series of continuous muffled sounds, and the gale formation was covered with dense cracks. It looked like it was about to collapse.</p><p>White Cloud Mountain Master was shocked. He hurriedly circulated his spiritual energy with all his might into the Trapping Skies Canopy, but he could only barely maintain the gale formation. He gritted his teeth and urged, "This demon is too powerful. The Trapping Skies Canopy won't be able to hold it for long. Fellow Daoists, attack with all your might!"</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang and the others couldn't hesitate any longer. They all sacrificed their artifacts and attacked the center of the gale formation.</p><p>The Corpse Demon was trapped in the gale formation with nowhere to escape. They didn't need to be distracted, they just needed to attack with all their might. The Five Elements Breaking Law Sword and Wu Yuesheng's spiritual sword unleashed their full power. Sword Qi pierced through the air, and the sight of the colorful sword Qi was spectacular, like a continuous stream of neon lights piercing into the gale formation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, not only did their sword Qi fail to suppress the Corpse Demon's arrogance, it made it even more frenzied. The muffled sounds came like a sudden storm, the turbulence of the gale formation became more and more violent. In order to maintain the Trapping Skies Canopy, White Cloud Mountain Master had no choice but to deplete his spiritual energy, and his face became increasingly pale.</p><p>White Cloud Mountain Master was anxious. He shouted, "Fellow Daoists, stop holding back! The Trapping Skies Canopy consumes a lot of spiritual energy, I'm about to lose my grip. Even if you two don't want to avenge Fellow Daoist Liu, you have to think about yourselves. The Dark Earth Qi is about to catch up. If we let this demon escape, we won't have a chance to break the seal on the Black Iron Heavy Gate and we'll all be trapped here!"</p><p>Provoked by White Cloud Mountain Master's words, Wu Yuesheng's face darkened. He snorted, "Why would Fellow Daoist White say such useless things? Fellow Daoist Liu was killed by the Corpse Demon, and the anger in my and Junior Apprentice Brother Qin's hearts is no less than Fellow Daoist White's. Moreover, my lifebound spiritual sword was damaged by the Corpse Demon, how can I let it go! Fellow Daoist White, don't worry, I will activate the Thousand Mechanisms Sword Formation and kill this demon."</p><p>After saying that, Wu Yuesheng raised his hand and summoned his spiritual sword that was attacking. Then, his mind entered the spiritual sword, he chanted incantations, and his hand seals changed rapidly.</p><p>White Cloud Mountain Master was overjoyed when he saw this. "It's good that Fellow Daoist Wu understands the importance of the situation!"</p><p>However, a hint of suspicion appeared in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>They had been attacking for so long, and he and Wu Yuesheng had been intentionally cooperating, focusing on one point. Even if the Corpse Demon had the Yellow Earth Armor, it should have shattered by now. To their surprise, the Corpse Demon showed no signs of injury or weakness. Instead, the gale formation was becoming increasingly unstable.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Wu Yuesheng and saw that he seemed to be unaware of anything. He was following White Cloud Mountain Master's instructions, focusing his mind on controlling the spiritual sword to prepare a powerful sword formation. White Cloud Mountain Master looked like he was desperately holding on.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly and pondered for a moment. A glint flashed in his eyes. Under White Cloud Mountain Master's gaze, he nodded at him, and pretended to throw out all the attack talismans he had been holding. Dozens of talismans were thrown out at once. The scene was spectacular. They transformed into various forms of attacks, surging into the gale formation like a tidal wave.</p><p>However, under the cover of these talismans, he secretly withdrew part of his divine consciousness, causing the Five Elements Breaking Law Sword's power to be greatly reduced.</p><p>On the other side, the hand seals formed by Wu Yuesheng became increasingly faster, dazzling the eyes. The spirit sword hovered in midair, following the motions of Wu Yuesheng until it suddenly emitted a resonant sword cry. The sword aura skyrocketed, the crimson sword aura like a raging fire, the temperature in the cold main hall instantly rising a few degrees.</p><p>Immediately after, a slight shudder was seen in the sword aura as it split into two. The split sword aura then began splitting again. In the blink of an eye, dozens of sword auras, identically sized, filled the air.</p><p>“Array formation!”</p><p>Wu Yuesheng gave the order, and dozens of sword auras moved in unison, forming a circular sword array, unceasingly rotating around the wind array. All sword auras simultaneously pointed toward the core of the wind array, radiating an unrivaled, powerful force.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng's eyes widened, and he shouted furiously, “Kill!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up and saw the Thousand Mechanism Sword Array, revolving rapidly like a millstone. He had never seen a jade slip with the details of this sword array in the Treasure Pagoda Peak. Perhaps Wu Yuesheng had acquired it elsewhere. This array seemed rather formidable; what would its true force be?</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as the Thousand Mechanism Sword Array was on the verge of erupting, the figure of the White Cloud Mountain Man suddenly swayed slightly. His aura abruptly became extremely faint, as though his spiritual power had been overdrawn and he had become exhausted. His legs gave way, and he fell to the ground with a sorrowful cry. With no one to maintain the Heaven Trapping Gourd, it also fell from midair.</p><p>Almost at the same time, Wu Yuesheng let out a shrill scream.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head abruptly and saw that the Evil Corpse had somehow escaped from the Heaven Trapping Gourd and had unexpectedly appeared where Wu Yuesheng had originally been standing. Wu Yuesheng was using all his strength to control the sword array, unprepared for what happened. He was struck in the chest, a fatal spot, by the Evil Corpse's claw and was violently flung, crashing into the stone wall of the main hall.</p><p>The sword array dissipated.</p><p>With a loud crash, Wu Yuesheng's body slid down from the stone wall like a piece of cloth. A large pool of blood instantly soaked into the ground, causing people to shudder in horror.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng lay motionlessly in the pool of blood, with no signs of life, looking as if he was at death's door.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Wu!”</p><p>The White Cloud Mountain Man cried out in sorrow, tears in his eyes and guilt all over his face. Seeing the Evil Corpse about to go and drain Wu Yuesheng's blood, he hurriedly took out a large handful of spirit pills and shoved them into his mouth. With great difficulty, he used the Heaven Trapping Gourd again to trap the Evil Corpse, powerlessly shouting, “Fellow Daoist Qin, I'm exhausted and won't be able to trap it for much longer. Quickly use all your strength to kill this devil and avenge our two fellow Daoists!”</p><p>Qin Sang had been coldly observing the scene the entire time, watching as the White Cloud Mountain Man fell and as Wu Yuesheng was struck by the Evil Corpse, without a single change in his expression.</p><p>Hearing the White Cloud Mountain Man's urging, Qin Sang glanced at him and said coolly, “Fellow Daoist White Cloud, are you truly exhausted? I don't believe it.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The White Cloud Mountain Man looked at Qin Sang, stunned, for a moment before suddenly letting out a chuckle, his aura instantly returning to normal and his complexion turning rosy again. There was not the slightest sign of exhaustion left.</p>
