<h1>Chapter 720: Old Mu the Devil</h1><p>“The inter-tribal war ended five years ago. How could it be so soon?”</p><p>The conflict between the Xiaohan Region and the Tianxing Alliance, from the initial dispute to the forced truce after the Ziwei Palace opened, lasted for decades.</p><p>Neither region, in terms of land area, cultivator numbers, or strength, could compare to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally estimated that the inter-tribal war would last at least a hundred years before a clear victor emerged. He had been worried that an overly intense war would leave human cultivators too exhausted to open the Seven Killing Hall, thus jeopardizing his plans.</p><p>Although the human race was strong, the Wu tribe also possessed top-tier Yuan Ying stage experts, especially since the Wu tribe had initiated the conflict.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the grand war, launched with the entire Wu tribe’s might, ended after only a decade, resembling a farce that was hastily concluded—something unprecedented.</p><p>“Who ultimately won, us or the Wu tribe?” Qin Sang curiously asked.</p><p>The man in black armor shook his head. “There’s no winner. The two tribes have now reconciled. Many rumors are circulating, but they are all baseless and absurd.”</p><p>The Wu tribe, by initiating the war at the risk of annihilation, must have had deep-seated reasons.</p><p>Unfortunately, they lacked the cultivation to delve into the higher echelons.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, regardless of the Wu tribe’s motives, it was none of his concern. Now that both tribes have ceased hostilities and the situation has stabilized, it’s a good thing; he no longer has to fear being caught in the turmoil and hide.</p><p>Subsequently, Qin Sang questioned the man in black further, gaining a grasp of the outside world’s situation.</p><p>Inconspicuously, he ascertained several key dates, and after mental calculation, he deduced the events at Han Yan Island.</p><p>Following the inter-tribal war, the various island masters of the Demon Sea refused to participate, adopting a policy of isolation to avoid the conflict. Before the war ended, the Huntian Island master hadn't discovered that a transformed demon had infiltrated the Thousand Demon Sea, plotting against Han Yan Island.</p><p>Five years ago, when the great war subsided and the Huntian Island blockade was lifted, Huntian Island gradually noticed anomalies in the Thousand Demon Sea. The Huntian Island master personally investigated, encountering the transformed demon, and instantly recognized the Dongming Cold Flame.</p><p>The Dongming Cold Flame was Dongming’s peerless divine ability and couldn't fall into the hands of the demons.</p><p>The demon, having absorbed the Dongming Cold Flame, would inevitably experience a massive surge in power, endangering Huntian Island.</p><p>A fierce battle between two Yuan Ying-level powerhouses ensued, turning the area upside down. The residual shockwaves easily destroyed Han Yan Island.</p><p>The Huntian Island master, slightly stronger than the transformed demon, drove it back into the depths of the Demon Sea. This battle occurred two years ago, coinciding with the turmoil in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Driven by curiosity about the Cold Flame, Qin Sang approached a small fragment of it. The man in black armor not only didn't stop him but watched expectantly, as if anticipating Qin Sang’s failure.</p><p>This close encounter with the Cold Flame was vastly different from the last.</p><p>Previously, the Dongming Cold Flame was undivided, a raging inferno, its terrifying chill inducing fear and preventing approach.</p><p>This small fragment was far gentler, resembling a small blue flower quietly blooming on the sea’s surface, appearing harmless.</p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang cautiously channeled a strand of true essence, lightly touching it.</p><p>The seemingly insignificant speck of Dongming Cold Flame, upon contact with his true essence, instantly revealed its fangs.</p><p>The Dongming Cold Flame, like a bud about to bloom, suddenly emitted a blue ring of light, rapidly expanding outward from its core.</p><p>A dense ‘crackling’ sound filled the air as the light ring quickly formed a thick layer of ice wherever it reached.</p><p>Even more startlingly, Qin Sang found that the strand of his true essence was also frozen, the terrifying chill spreading towards him along the true essence.</p><p>Qin Sang was greatly startled. Reacting swiftly, he severed his connection with the true essence and quickly retreated.</p><p>After a while, the Dongming Cold Flame calmed down.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s flustered state, the man in black armor burst into laughter. “Friend, don't underestimate it because of its size.  Even this small fragment could easily freeze you and me to death. That transformed demon, after discovering the Cold Flame, stayed here for an unknown number of years, unable to consume it. After driving the demon away, the island master remained here for months, trying various methods to remove the lingering essence of Dongming’s presence and recover the Cold Flame, without success. Furthermore, due to the Cold Flame’s ferocity, even setting up a concealment formation was impossible. Fortunately, Dongming left some means before his death, some of which remain to temporarily restrain the Cold Flame. The island master left Lu here to guard it, preventing the demon from returning.”</p><p>Having witnessed firsthand the power of the Winter Flame, Qin Sang knew the black-armored man wasn't exaggerating.</p><p>His eyes flickered, lost in thought.</p><p>“Even the Island Master can't contain the Winter Flame.  Why worry about the demon tribe getting it? If the Flame stays here, won't you be stuck here forever, unable to leave?”</p><p>“The Island Master said that great demon has the bloodline of an ancient fire toad.  The Winter Flame shouldn't be shattered like this; it’s all thanks to that demon.  Given more time, it might devour the Winter Flame entirely. We must be wary.”</p><p>The black-armored man said with a relaxed expression, “I won’t be stuck here for long either. The Island Master has contacted an old acquaintance, a powerful figure from the Inner Sea, the Lord of Tianfeng Island, Mu Lue – Old Devil Mu. He's interested in the Winter Flame. If he can take it, this whole affair will naturally settle down.”</p><p>“Old Devil Mu…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. His knowledge of the Inner Sea’s powers was superficial; he’d never heard of this man.</p><p>“In that case, I’m relieved. Thank you, Daoist Lu, for clarifying things. I’ve been trapped in the Demon Sea for too long; I’m exhausted and eager to return. Let’s meet again if fate allows.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, about to leave, when the black-armored man unexpectedly called out.</p><p>“Wait, Daoist friend.  Since you’ve hunted demons in the Demon Sea for many years, with your strength, you must have made a considerable harvest, right? Do you have any materials and demon cores from demonic beasts with the bloodline of ancient divine beasts? Especially descendants of the Xuanwu, I’d like to buy them all.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “Indeed, I do.  I even killed a Xuan Turtle, but they were all early-stage demon beasts.  I’m afraid they won't meet your standards.”</p><p>These beasts, called descendants of divine beasts, inherit some of the ancient divine beasts’ abilities, making their cores and materials far more valuable than those of ordinary sea beasts.</p><p>“No matter.”</p><p>The black-armored man waved his hand, his face brightening. “These beasts are powerful, and those with high cultivation are not only rare but also difficult to kill. Could you show me the turtle shell from that beast, Daoist friend… let me have a look…”</p><p>And so, in the middle of nowhere in the Demon Sea, the two struck a deal.</p><p>Qin Sang sold him some demon cores and materials, and was satisfied with the exchange. They chatted amiably and made plans to meet again.</p><p>Bidding farewell to the black-armored man, Qin Sang soared into the sky and departed alone.</p>
