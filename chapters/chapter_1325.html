<h1>Chapter 1317: The Flame-Eating Beast</h1><p>"Junior Yun Lan, a steward of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, greets Senior Qin. Is this Senior Qin in person?"</p><p>Three men and one woman, all disciples of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, flew swiftly to Qin Sang's side. Upon recognizing his face, their expressions turned to awe, and they bowed respectfully. Surprisingly, the female disciple was at the Golden Core stage of cultivation.</p><p>A Golden Core disciple guarding the gates.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Qing Jun's earlier remark that the Ethereal Spirit Sect had quietly amassed great wealth during the war. Now, it seemed this was indeed true. The foundation of the Azure Goat Temple still couldn't compare to these renowned sects.</p><p>The woman appeared to be in her twenties, with a graceful figure and a charming face. She wore a red palace robe and was the one who had spoken earlier.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't concealed his true appearance. He had gained some renown throughout the Northern Star Realm, and few cultivators from the two regions didn't recognize him. Thus, the female cultivator had immediately identified him.</p><p>"It is I," Qin Sang replied calmly, nodding. "I previously made an appointment with Fellow Daoist Bing Han. Today, I have some free time and have come specifically to visit. I hope you can relay my arrival."</p><p>Yun Lan's face lit up with joy. "There's no need for prior notification, Senior Qin. Please follow me into the sect. I was actually ordered by our sect master to wait here for your arrival."</p><p>"Oh? Fellow Daoist Bing Han is quite thoughtful. Then I shall accept her kind invitation," Qin Sang said with a slight nod.</p><p>Yun Lan gestured for the other three disciples to withdraw and led the way herself.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately slowed his pace, leisurely taking in the surrounding scenery.</p><p>As they flew over the dormant volcanoes, Qin Sang noticed some spirit beasts below that resembled leopards but were not quite the same. They were small, about the size of cats, but with tails twice as long as their bodies, covered in fluffy fur.</p><p>Their entire bodies were covered in fiery red fur without a single blemish, with a bright sheen flowing between the hairs, as if molten lava coursed through them. Only their eyes were black.</p><p>The spirit beasts were lowering their heads, searching for something on the ground.</p><p>When Qin Sang and the others flew past, they lifted their heads, their eyes gentle, filled with a touch of innocence and curiosity. They tilted their heads to glance at the newcomers before returning to their tasks.</p><p>Behind the spirit beasts, some Ethereal Spirit Sect disciples were panting, being led around by the creatures. Upon seeing Yun Lan, they quickly bowed in respect.</p><p>"Are these the famous Flame-Eating Beasts of your sect?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Although other sects didn't specialize in beast taming like the Beast Taming Sect, they still possessed similar secret techniques. The spirit beasts they chose to cultivate and nurture all had unique abilities.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang was that the Flame-Eating Beasts' eyes held no trace of killing intent. They seemed like innocent children, as if they had never experienced battle.</p><p>"Indeed, they are the Flame-Eating Beasts. However, many of the rumors circulating about them are exaggerated and don't do justice to their true nature. They likely wouldn't catch Senior Qin's interest," Yun Lan said with a soft laugh. Seeing Qin Sang's curiosity, she explained, "Many claim that the Flame-Eating Beasts possess formidable abilities, but in reality, they are referring to another spirit beast, the Red-Tailed Leopard, which resembles the Flame-Eating Beasts. Of course, these rumors were deliberately spread by our sect to protect the Flame-Eating Beasts. Their innate ability lies in controlling fire, which helps us stabilize spiritual flames during artifact forging, increasing our success rate. However, they themselves possess little combat power."</p><p>As she spoke, Yun Lan pointed to the ground. "The Flame-Eating Beasts are foraging, but their food is quite unique—it's the fiery energy from the underground lava veins that hasn't yet taken form as fire spirits. Recently, the underground lava veins have been unstable, causing the fiery energy buried deep within to rise to the surface."</p><p>Qin Sang followed her gaze.</p><p>He saw one of the Flame-Eating Beasts suddenly let out a sharp cry, as if it had sensed something. It plunged its head into the ground, digging out a large hole.</p><p>A wisp of red smoke rose from the ground, alive and writhing, trying to escape into the distance.</p><p>The surrounding Flame-Eating Beasts immediately pounced, devouring the smoke in an instant.</p><p>Soon after, fiery energy began to seep out from the cracks in the ground, much to the delight of the Flame-Eating Beasts, who chirped happily as they feasted.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's attention was drawn to the underground.</p><p>In his perception, the underground lava veins had suddenly surged with a wave of energy. The fluctuation wasn't strong, otherwise it wouldn't have only released this much fiery energy.</p><p>But the source of the fluctuation was unmistakable—it came from deep within the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Even after being weakened by the sect's protective formations, the fluctuation still carried such intensity, which was quite intriguing.</p><p>Qin Sang remained expressionless, withdrawing his gaze.</p><p>Yun Lan couldn't possibly guess Qin Sang's thoughts and continued leading the way.</p><p>Before long, the two passed through an invisible barrier. The surrounding heat vanished, replaced by a warm, spring-like atmosphere. The barren landscape gave way to lush greenery, teeming with life.</p><p>This area, close to the Ethereal Spirit Sect's mountain gate, was where the underground lava veins converged. Yet, it was a scene of thriving vitality.</p><p>Deep within the forest stood a mountain. It wasn't particularly tall, but it was exceptionally broad, a rare sight indeed.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the mountain, recalling what he knew about the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p><p>This mountain was likely the sect's most important forbidden area. The summit wasn't flat but instead formed a massive volcanic crater. The legendary mountain within a mountain was said to lie within its depths.</p><p>Along the way, they encountered many Ethereal Spirit Sect disciples. Upon seeing Yun Lan, they all bowed respectfully, stealing curious glances at Qin Sang. Some recognized him, their faces filled with astonishment.</p><p>Qin Sang observed carefully. Regardless of their cultivation levels, these disciples were all full of vitality, their auras robust, and their talents exceptional. This was a testament to the Ethereal Spirit Sect's profound foundation and Bing Han's skill in nurturing disciples.</p><p>After this matter was settled, he might as well seek her advice on how to develop a sect effectively.</p><p>As he pondered these trivial matters, Qin Sang was surprised to find that Yun Lan was leading him straight toward the forbidden area without any intention of stopping.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Moments later, the two entered the forbidden area, landing in front of an exquisite palace halfway up the mountain, named the Flame-Repelling Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the palace had no protective formations. Scanning it with his divine sense, he found it empty and couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p>At that moment, a streak of light descended from the sky, landing in Yun Lan's palm.</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Yun Lan's eyes. After a moment of hesitation, she said with an apologetic expression, "Senior Qin, I've just received word that the sect master is currently in seclusion within the mountain within a mountain, at a critical moment. She won't be able to come out to greet you for now. Please rest in the Flame-Repelling Pavilion for a few days. I hope you won't mind."</p><p>"It seems I've come at an inconvenient time. Since Fellow Daoist Bing Han is occupied with important matters, waiting a few days is no trouble," Qin Sang replied, waving his hand dismissively. He naturally wouldn't make things difficult for a junior.</p><p>Yun Lan breathed a sigh of relief and personally arranged for spiritual fruits and immortal wine to be served, but Qin Sang declined them all.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Yun Lan not to stand on ceremony and to call him once Bing Han emerged from seclusion. He then sealed the Flame-Repelling Pavilion with formations, isolating it from the outside world. Yun Lan, however, didn't dare to be negligent and personally stood guard nearby, ready to attend to any requests.</p><p>After inspecting the Flame-Repelling Pavilion and confirming there were no strange formations inside, Qin Sang opened his spirit beast pouch. A red streak shot into his hand—it was the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede couldn't escape Qin Sang's palm, scurrying around anxiously in his hand.</p>
