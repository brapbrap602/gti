<h1>Chapter 1672: Return to Place</h1><p>As time passed, the Tianhao Ancient Mirror was no longer merely touching the surface of the seal, but had become entirely embedded within it, continuously sinking deeper.  During this process, it didn't stir the slightest ripple or counterattack from the seal, as smooth as a knife through butter, a testament to the mirror's profound mystical power.</p><p>When the Tianhao Ancient Mirror penetrated the seal's interior, the scene within was unexpected. It wasn't the anticipated riot of colors, but a world devoid of light.</p><p>Dark, oppressive.</p><p>Through the Tianhao Ancient Mirror, this sensation transmitted to Fan Laomo's spirit, making him secretly apprehensive.</p><p>Soon, the Tianhao Ancient Mirror's reflection revealed that this wasn't pure darkness.  There was indeed a light source. At the heart of the darkness, a single point of light flickered.</p><p>Five colors separated and intertwined, echoing the seal.</p><p>The Tianhao Ancient Mirror immediately moved towards it, and the reflection of a five-colored crown appeared.</p><p>The ancient mirror stopped beside the five-colored crown.  The Ghostly Lotus within the mirror slowly drifted outwards. As the lotus drifted, its closed petals unfolded layer by layer, resuming its Myriad Illusions Ghostly Lotus form.  At the lotus's heart, a mass of black qi undulated, gradually coalescing into a human silhouette – it was Fan Laomo!</p><p>At this moment, Fan Laomo's state was peculiar.  He hadn't entered with his true body. Instead, he used a secret technique to transform into a Phantom Demon body, possessing the mirror, using the Tianhao Mirror as a vessel to bring his phantom form inside.</p><p>Although not his true body, and thus subject to certain limitations, many mystical powers could still be wielded by this Phantom Demon body.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Fan Laomo opened his eyes, which were pitch black, with pupils resembling two Ghostly Lotuses.</p><p>"Is this that spiritual treasure?"</p><p>His black eyes shifted, a hint of doubt in Fan Laomo's gaze. Here, the five elements converged, the vital energies chaotic. His gaze fell upon the five-colored crown. Just as he was about to carefully analyze its patterns, he saw the crown tremble.</p><p>Five-colored radiance instantly illuminated all directions. Fan Laomo had a feeling that although the crown's outward appearance hadn't changed, it was utterly different from before. A supreme treasure was awakening.</p><p>In fact, Fan Laomo distinctly felt something awakening within the five-colored crown...</p><p>This something seemed to be... consciousness!</p><p>Consciousness... awakening?</p><p>This unprecedented sensation stunned Fan Laomo.  Then, that feeling intensified, definitely not an illusion. In an instant, perhaps even less, a more tangible sensation emerged.</p><p>It was the feeling of being watched!</p><p>The source of the 'gaze' was the five-colored crown.</p><p>The Phantom Demon body, impervious to heat and cold, shuddered at this moment. A chill shot straight through his crown, nearly causing him to cry out, "Artifact Spirit!"</p><p>Artifact Spirit!</p><p>The five-colored crown had birthed an Artifact Spirit!</p><p>In truth, Tianhao Tower's Tianhao Ancient Mirror and Eight Sceneries View's Eight Sceneries Palace Lantern were both spiritual treasures.  The presence of a spiritual treasure to suppress a sect's destiny was also a hallmark of a top-tier sect.  Naturally, Sweet Dew Monastery wasn't lacking one.</p><p>But spiritual treasures differed not only in power but also in strength.</p><p>In distinguishing the strength of spiritual treasures, spirituality was a crucial factor.</p><p>When spirituality reached its peak and an Artifact Spirit was born, it marked a further transformation of the spiritual treasure.</p><p>The Tianhao Ancient Mirror and Eight Sceneries Palace Lantern had never clashed directly, and neither sect would willingly reveal their secrets. However, it was certain that both were far from birthing an Artifact Spirit.</p><p>The timeframe was difficult to calculate. It could be hundreds or thousands of years, or perhaps an Artifact Spirit would never be born.</p><p>Because even when spirituality reached its apex, it remained in a chaotic state, not necessarily capable of giving birth to a spirit. This stage was also known as the Spirit Molding stage, its difficulty comparable to a cultivator breaking through a major realm bottleneck.</p><p>Perhaps even more difficult!</p><p>Of course, Fan Laomo had gleaned this knowledge from ancient texts collected by his sect. Cultivators in the Middle Continent were numerous as the sands of the Ganges, with no shortage of Soul Transformation grandmasters, yet there were no clear records of a spiritual treasure molding a spirit.</p><p>Among this world's cultivators, very few possessed spiritual treasures.  Those at the late Nascent Soul stage, like him, were still using various secret techniques to elevate their natal magic treasures to pseudo-spiritual treasures, striving towards true spiritual treasure status.</p><p>Who would dare to dream of the unattainable Artifact Spirit?</p><p>At this moment, amidst his shock, Fan Laomo suddenly understood what the Formless Immortal Sect had sealed within Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>It was to suppress an Artifact Spirit!</p><p>Even a spiritual treasure would actively choose its master, requiring the *Treasure Mastery Canon* to control.  Since there was an Artifact Spirit, how could it willingly submit to a cultivator's enslavement?</p><p>Back then, when the Formless Immortal Sect wielded this treasure during the demonic tribulation, it was always accompanied by a grand formation. Thinking back now, the formations were different each time, yet all subtly aligned with the Dao of the Five Elements.</p><p>Presumably, one purpose was to wield the treasure, and the other was to suppress the Artifact Spirit, preventing it from causing chaos.</p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts flashed through his mind. Fan Laomo believed he had grasped the truth, yet his spirit remained tense, feeling the Artifact Spirit's gaze.</p><p>Raging emotions were palpable.</p><p>This was the fury accumulated from repeated failed schemes, being manipulated, and now, when the Artifact Spirit realized something was amiss, discovering that even its home had been invaded!</p><p>Under the gaze of such extreme anger, Fan Laomo's heart pounded.  Seeing the jade pieces on the five-colored crown radiating brilliantly, a premonition of danger arose.</p><p>Without time to think, he instinctively waved his right hand, a dark green streak of light shooting out.</p><p>Within the streak, faintly visible were glittering grains of dark green fine sand.  A green light flickered on the surface of the sand, like tiny will-o'-the-wisps, bone-chillingly sinister.</p><p>This was a treasure Fan Laomo had refined from various venomous and sinister materials, called the Filthy Yin Phosphorus Sand, specifically designed to defile magic treasures.</p><p>When using the Phantom Demon body, one could temporarily transform a treasure connected to one's spirit into a mystical power to bring inside. Fan Laomo's goal was to seize the spiritual treasure, preventing Zhu Wudao from controlling it and greatly increasing his strength.  His first choice was naturally the Filthy Yin Phosphorus Sand.</p><p>Although he hadn't anticipated encountering an Artifact Spirit, it was a blessing in disguise. Using the Filthy Yin Phosphorus Sand here was opportune. However, Fan Laomo wasn't sure how effective it would be against an Artifact Spirit.</p><p>He was even less certain of the strength of a five-colored crown that had birthed an Artifact Spirit.</p><p>He coveted the five-colored crown, but he understood the principle of knowing one's limits.  He didn't dare seize the treasure directly, he had to proceed cautiously.</p><p>Therefore, as the Filthy Yin Phosphorus Sand flew out, Fan Laomo retreated towards the Myriad Illusions Ghostly Lotus. He didn't want to lose this Phantom Demon body here.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Fan Laomo was very close to the five-colored crown. The Filthy Yin Phosphorus Sand instantly enveloped it, the fine sand transforming into specks of filthy phosphorus fire, clinging to the crown's surface, suddenly staining it with blemishes.</p><p>The five-colored crown's luster dimmed, tainted by the dark green sinister light.</p><p>But at this moment, Fan Laomo's expression drastically changed.</p><p>Just as the Filthy Yin Phosphorus Sand was about to hit the five-colored crown, from beneath the crown, a long-hidden black tide suddenly erupted.  The black tide surged, carrying a terrifying demonic intent that chilled even a great devil like Fan Laomo, fiercely impacting the five-colored crown.</p><p>It was because of this impact that the five-colored crown shuddered violently, its five-colored spiritual light wavering.  The Artifact Spirit, caught off guard, couldn't react in time and was struck by the Filthy Yin Phosphorus Sand.</p><p>The black tide was the true master of the seal!</p><p>He had been used!</p><p>Fan Laomo was startled and furious. It was too late to recall the Filthy Yin Phosphorus Sand. Many questions arose in his mind.</p><p>What was the relationship between the Artifact Spirit and the black tide? If the five-colored crown was part of the seal, why hadn't the Artifact Spirit counterattacked or warned him when he entered the seal?</p><p>...</p><p>On Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang had tricked and led the Poison King away, while his true body relentlessly pursued Kundao.</p><p>The Sun God Tree and Four-Chariot Azure Serpent Seal combined to unleash several attacks. Although the barrier acted as a buffer, Kundao was still injured, exacerbating her wounds.</p><p>Simultaneously, Kundao had to divert her attention to expel the sword intent Qin Sang had left within her body, forcing her to flee with all her might, barely able to retaliate.</p><p>Although his avatar wasn't by his side, Qin Sang still held the absolute advantage, no longer needing to maintain the罡fire shield, moving with ease.</p><p>From outside the mountain, one could see fireworks blooming intermittently down the slopes of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, some crimson, some black.</p><p>The Goldfall Sword hovered above Qin Sang's head, sword intent continuously accumulating, yet restrained.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Sun God Tree in one hand, and in the other, the Demonic Fire Dragon coiled, launching attacks in turn.</p><p>Ignoring her internal injuries, Kundao focused on suppressing and expelling the sword intent within her. Finally, before Qin Sang forced her true form to emerge, she expelled the last trace of his sword intent.</p><p>Unconsciously letting out a sigh of relief, Kundao suddenly shifted dozens of zhang within the barrier, then froze, as the Demonic Fire Dragon arrived close behind.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The violent impact transmitted through the barrier into Kundao's body, further injuring her already ravaged form.</p><p>It wasn't sword intent!</p><p>How did he find me?</p><p>Kundao was about to go mad, but Qin Sang didn't give her a chance to think.  The Demonic Fire Dragon followed her like a shadow.  Her increasingly severe injuries reminded her that this body couldn't hold on much longer.</p><p>"The time is ripe."</p><p>Qin Sang had been assessing Kundao's condition.</p><p>As soon as the thought arose, sword light flashed like a dragon.</p><p>Wherever the Goldfall Sword passed, the sword formation reformed.</p><p>At this moment, an unexpected scene unfolded.  A furious roar, filled with extreme rage, suddenly erupted from the barrier. Then, a figure flashed, and Kundao plummeted, eyes tightly shut,气息gone.</p><p>Caught off guard, Qin Sang nearly sliced Kundao to pieces.  He quickly diverted the Demonic Fire and withdrew his sword energy.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Sword threads wrapped around Kundao's body, floating towards Qin Sang.</p><p>"She's truly dead..."</p><p>Qin Sang briefly sensed, finding no life force within Kundao. She was indeed dead, leaving him deeply puzzled.</p><p>He hadn't expected Kundao to be so resolute, choosing to commit suicide when the situation turned dire.</p><p>He had patiently pursued her this far, intending to capture her alive.</p><p>Regardless, the most crucial objective had been achieved.  Qin Sang looked at Kundao's waist, snatching the crimson immortal pendant.  He immediately felt a surge of scorching yang energy enter his body, his whole being burning hot.</p><p>Its power rivaled the chilling煞energy of the Mysterious Ice Disc.</p><p>"What a treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed, his heart filled with delight.</p><p>Now, the two most important treasures for the Tribulation Transcendence Formation were assembled.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, Qin Sang's divine sense swept over Kundao's body, but he couldn't find a storage pouch or any other spatial storage artifact.  Could she have gained nothing from the medicine garden?</p><p>Recalling the various illogical details, connecting them together, Qin Sang's doubts grew, increasingly feeling that Kundao's suicide wasn't normal.</p><p>Just then, a furious roar echoed.</p><p>The roar's origin was unknown.</p><p>It seemed to come from the mountaintop, yet also from the barrier itself. It wasn't loud, yet impossible to ignore, filled with boundless fury, shocking to hear.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, his brow furrowed.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't the only one startled by the roar.</p><p>Behind Qin Sang's true body.</p><p>The Poison King had pursued the avatar, quickly realizing he'd been tricked. Sensing the commotion created by Qin Sang's true body in the distance, he turned to leave.</p><p>The avatar wasn't merely a decoy.</p><p>Just as the Poison King moved, he felt a chilling sensation. Turning, he saw an Azure Serpent, wreathed in layers of cold flames, baring its fangs and claws, tearing through the wind煞, lunging towards him.</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>The Poison King's expression darkened.  He waved his hand, the poison cloud surrounding him condensing above his head, meeting the Azure Serpent.</p><p>Upon contact, the Poison King sensed something amiss. He hurriedly summoned poison sand, shooting it towards the poison cloud. The poison cloud abruptly contracted, becoming several times denser than before.</p><p>*Poof!*</p><p>The Azure Serpent crashed head-on into the poison cloud.</p><p>The poison cloud vibrated violently, nearly torn apart by the Azure Serpent. But supported by the poison sand, its structure held, not shattering, only the surface poison mist was assaulted by the cold flames, freezing into poison ice of various colors.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The poison ice shattered, and the poison sand, carrying the remaining poison cloud, shot back.</p><p>The Poison King gracefully retreated dozens of zhang, his phoenix eyes narrowing, watching the avatar return from the depths of the wind煞.</p><p>"A spiritual treasure?"</p><p>The Poison King first noticed the Four-Chariot Azure Serpent Seal above the avatar's head.</p><p>Spiritual treasures in the Middle Continent were numbered.</p><p>The Poison King mentally reviewed them all, but didn't recognize it. The records related to the Formless Immortal Sect didn't mention this spiritual treasure either.  Although the opponent was only at the mid-Nascent Soul realm, wielding a spiritual treasure, they couldn't be underestimated.</p><p>However, why had a mid-Nascent Soul helper inexplicably appeared beside Qin Sang?</p><p>Recalling the sudden fluctuation he had sensed from Qin Sang's side earlier, the Poison King's expression shifted.  "This is… your clone? No, an External Avatar!"</p><p>The avatar's vital energy was perfectly unified, far surpassing a mere clone.</p><p>This explained everything.</p><p>This person not only possessed exceptional strength himself but also an External Avatar wielding a spiritual treasure. Only this could explain how the rebel had fallen into his hands.</p><p>"First a late Nascent Soul puppet, now an External Avatar, this place is truly a haven for hidden dragons and crouching tigers..."</p><p>The Poison King sighed with a smile.  "Fellow Daoist, do you believe you can stop me with just an avatar?"</p><p>His identity exposed, the avatar didn't bother with further pretense. He was happy to converse with the Poison King, buying time for his true body. He calmly said, "Why must Poison King be so aggressive?"</p><p>"I only wish for an answer from Fellow Daoist..."</p><p>The Poison King repeated his offer, promising great rewards.</p><p>"Once this matter is concluded, and my true body is free, I will contact Fellow Daoist..."</p><p>The avatar was interrupted mid-sentence by the Poison King.</p><p>"Since the avatar cannot make decisions, this King will have to personally consult Fellow Daoist's true body," the Poison King bellowed, abruptly transforming into escaping light.</p><p>The Poison King had realized the other party had little intention of returning the Gu King.</p><p>Stopping now would be a joke.  Wait for the other party to resolve the trouble, return fully laden, and leisurely concoct the Gu King?  Or pray for their charity?</p><p>He only had a chance to seize the initiative by creating more trouble for them!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>As soon as the escaping light appeared, the Azure Serpent swooped down.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Poison King stopped abruptly, feigning escape, turning to face the avatar, lunging even faster.</p><p>The avatar was prepared.  His eyes turned completely white, and a pale, chilling light swept down from before him, as his form shot backwards.</p><p>The Ice Soul Cold Light was like a wall of ice, unleashed without hesitation, forming a barrier.</p><p>Extremely cautious, the avatar wouldn't give the Poison King a chance to use that caterpillar-like Gu worm. He only circled at a distance, harassing with the spiritual treasure and Ice Soul Divine Light, never approaching.</p><p>Although he couldn't stop the Poison King, he could delay him.</p><p>Until the roar echoed, both sides abruptly ceased fighting.</p>
