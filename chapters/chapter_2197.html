<h1>Chapter 2187: The Beast Tide</h1><p>“My guess is that the ancestors are either preoccupied with something, or there's a hidden secret behind this Sacred Land upheaval.  If the situation spirals out of their control, threatening the survival of all races, they would certainly try to contact us.  The fact that they can send people out of the Sacred Land without any warning suggests they are testing us, not intervening directly.  As for what happens once we leave, Master Ning certainly won't stand idly by.”</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader said, looking at Liuli beside him.</p><p>Liuli’s face was frosty.</p><p>Until now, Qin Sang had never explained the situation fully. Only now did she understand the full picture, that a powerful enemy was hidden within the Sacred Land.</p><p>“This feud started in the Lower Realm. Daoist Friend Qin formed an enmity to protect the beings of a world—this is a righteous act.  They are our common enemy, and Qin Daoist Friend cannot bear this burden alone!  Once we leave, I will report this to my Master and ask for his help!”</p><p>Liuli said earnestly:  “From now on, I will face them with Qin Daoist Friend!”</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth to speak, but Liuli interrupted him, “The situation has changed, Brother Qin is in mortal danger. If I stand by and watch, how can I accept his help in the future? I was restricted in the Bi Xie Ancient Palace due to my lack of understanding of detoxification methods, but as long as it's not a place like that, unsealing the Imperial Heavenly Decree Talisman should at least allow me to hold one person back, easing the pressure on Qin Daoist Friend!”</p><p>Liuli's tone was resolute, her lips tightly pressed together, her current expression mirroring the stubborn face from Qin Sang's memories.</p><p>Unsealing the Imperial Heavenly Decree Talisman would come at a significant cost to Liuli, the host. This precious opportunity was meant to be used at a critical moment after finding the secret realm.</p><p>Seeing Liuli’s expression, Qin Sang knew her mind was set and didn’t try to dissuade her, simply nodding silently.</p><p>Together, they could escape unharmed even against three late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators. However, eliminating the hidden danger and killing the celestial child and the informant required the right time, place, and people.</p><p>They had none of those!</p><p>What the two powerful Unity Stage cultivators were planning remained unknown, and the celestial child's whereabouts were also unclear. Any planning now was futile; they could only wait and see, adapting as needed.</p><p>After a brief discussion, the three returned to the cliff, their expressions unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli found a spot at the edge of the stone platform, took out their cushions, and like the others, sat in meditation, waiting for a turning point.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang appeared to be in meditation, but a strand of his consciousness entered his small paradise.</p><p>After subduing the Thunder Beast Guard, Qin Sang placed it within his small paradise. It stood quietly at the foot of Mount Daiyu, motionless, like an unintelligent puppet.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang's understanding of the Thunder Beast Guard deepened. He discovered that it couldn't be simply described as an object or a living being.</p><p>The Thunder Beast Guard was certainly not an ordinary creature in the world, but neither was it a mindless lump of metal.</p><p>It possessed an extreme battle instinct. The thunder generals guarding the Thunder Palace were manifestations of the Thunder Beast Guard's power. Their abilities were just a fraction of the Thunder Beast Guard's full capabilities; its fighting power was undeniably formidable.</p><p>On the other hand, it was very 'simple', without unnecessary thoughts, only its master and battle occupying its mind. Once it acknowledged a master, it would completely obey their will, making the description of a puppet somewhat accurate.</p><p>Without a master, its intelligence might gradually grow, and with some opportunities, it might become a truly self-aware being, like the Taiyi formed from a talisman. But it could also become uncontrollable, as battle and killing were inseparable, eventually transforming into a terrifying killing machine – this was probably why the ancestor of the Yi Ren tribe sealed it away.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the person who sealed the Thunder Beast Guard wasn't its original owner, but a later ancestor of the Yi Ren tribe who, after obtaining Mount Yuanjiao, discovered the war-guard and sealed it away for future generations.</p><p>As for the [missing character] pearl, Qin Sang had originally thought there were a pair, the right eye of the Thunder Beast missing, but now he realized there was only one; the right eye was always illusory.</p><p>Perhaps the creator of the Thunder Beast Guard designed it that way, or perhaps the Thunder Beast Guard couldn't handle two [missing character] pearls. This might be an avenue for future improvements.</p><p>Of course, it was too early to think about that now. The more Qin Sang understood the Thunder Beast Guard, the more he appreciated its ingenuity. He wondered if he would have the ability to improve it once he reached the peak of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Sensing its master's will, the Thunder Beast Guard’s armor clanged, fierce light flashing in its eyes, as it prepared to pounce.</p><p>Qin Sang took this opportunity to familiarize himself with the Thunder Beast Guard's abilities to prepare for the upcoming battle.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Thunder Beast Guard turned into a flash of lightning and shot into the sky.</p><p>A flash of lightning illuminated Lei Beast Battle Guard, its body bathed in electric light as it moved erratically through the storm, leaving behind numerous afterimages—a true thunder beast commanding lightning!</p><p>For many years, Xiaodongtian had been slowly recovering, now able to withstand the impact of these divine abilities without risk of collapse.</p><p>Time flowed slowly as Qin Sang practiced the Lei Beast Battle Guard's abilities, growing increasingly familiar with them.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang sensed something unusual outside and immediately awoke.</p><p>Calculating mentally, Qin Sang realized he had been there for over ten days.  His gaze swept across the mountain, revealing many unfamiliar faces.</p><p>Liuli, the Yuanxiang clan leader, Yuan Jian, and others had also been awakened.  Most of the others roused themselves, their gazes unanimously drawn to the area beyond the mist—the direction from which they had arrived.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>…</p><p>The mist fluctuated restlessly, accompanied by increasingly clear pulsations.  Initially faint, they grew stronger, as if a giant heart were beating outside.</p><p>This sound filled everyone with unease.</p><p>"What is it outside?"</p><p>Qin Sang sent a voice transmission to the Yuanxiang clan leader, asking, "Has anyone gone out to investigate these past few days?"</p><p>Everyone awaited the orders of the Saint Realm powerhouses, but the two Saint Realm experts remained unseen, their actions unknown.</p><p>"Fellow cultivators who arrived in the last two days said the Sacred Land has been completely destroyed by the radiant light," the Yuanxiang clan leader lamented. The Sacred Land held immense significance for the Yi people; the news caused a collective sigh among those present.</p><p>"With the destruction of the Sacred Land, the barrier between the two spaces was torn apart, blending together.  The radiant light swept through everything, almost completely smoothing out the fissures.  The Heart Lake is now surrounded and this place has become an island.  The passage reappeared twice, so fewer cultivators should be arriving now…"</p><p>"Where is the Feather King?" Qin Sang whispered.</p><p>This was also a mystery to the Yuanxiang clan leader, who shook his head.  "Still missing. No one knows where he has gone."</p><p>Crisis breeds opportunity; great upheaval often brings great fortune. He didn't believe all the Feather Clan had left the Sacred Land; they must have secret methods, hiding themselves.</p><p>"So, it's still just the two Saint Realm experts…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. It seemed the situation remained unchanged.</p><p>As they spoke, the vibrations grew increasingly distinct.</p><p>By now, those who dared remain, besides Liuli and a few others, were the top experts from various clans, their spiritual senses exceptionally sharp.</p><p>"Something's coming in!"</p><p>Someone suddenly stood up, shouting.</p><p>*Swish! Swish!*</p><p>Figures flew out of the mountain one after another, hovering in mid-air, staring at the mist with grave expressions.</p><p>Occasionally, someone looked up at the sky, but the two Saint Realm experts still gave no command.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>The mist churned, a gale seemingly rising within, intensifying the anxiety.</p><p>Something was undeniably entering, but its nature remained unknown, and no one volunteered to investigate.</p><p>However, someone finally lost their patience. An elder with antlers on his head and white beard blew a whistle; a shimmering image materialized before him, revealing a ferocious green tiger, not solid, yet far more menacing than a real one.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The antlered elder growled, and the tiger leaped, vanishing into the depths of the mist.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the elder snorted coldly, his face darkening. "We're in trouble!"</p><p>"Elder Li, what is attacking?  Are those gray figures again?" someone asked.</p><p>"It's beasts!  Countless beasts! A horde!" the antlered elder declared.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"How could it be the Yao Clan?"</p><p>"What are the Eastern Sea clans doing?"</p><p>…</p><p>Their exchange was not hushed; these words ignited the scene.</p><p>Disbelief and even panic swept through the crowd.</p><p>For years, the Xun and Kan states of humankind, the Yi people, and the Eastern Sea clans had maintained a three-legged stand. While not harmonious, there was a fragile peace.</p><p>Their Tian Department had even frequently interacted with the Eastern Sea clans, implicitly cooperating against the Shui Department and humankind.</p><p>Why would the Eastern Sea clans attack the Yi people without warning or provocation?</p><p>Furthermore, the Eastern Sea clans alone couldn't contain all the Yi ancestors—unless they'd allied with the Yao domain!</p><p>If an enemy truly plotted against the Yi people, now was the ideal time. The clan ancestors and elites were all at the Sacred Land; the outside was vulnerable.  Controlling the Sacred Land would mean easy victory.</p><p>At that moment, an icy voice echoed from the heavens.</p><p>"Everyone, attack! Stop them!  Let even one through, and I will hold you accountable!"</p><p>Simultaneously, the Shui Department cultivators heard the Saint Realm powerhouse’s warning.</p><p>A chill ran down everyone's spines, yet a sense of relief followed.  The Saint Realm powerhouse's calm tone suggested the situation wasn't as dire as they feared.</p><p>Soon, they finally saw the enemy's true form.</p><p>A vast, dark mass emerged from the fog, like a huge black tide sweeping towards them.  The roar from within was deafening, the ground shaking as if mountains were collapsing.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the tide was composed of countless demonic beasts—a beast horde!</p><p>The sheer number of beasts was overwhelming, packed together without a single gap, encompassing every imaginable species.  Wolves, tigers, leopards, dragons, phoenixes, qilin—spiritual beasts, auspicious beasts, ordinary demonic beasts, land dwellers, aquatic creatures, birds of the sky—Qin Sang recognized many, but countless others were completely unfamiliar to him.</p><p>Everyone's eyes widened. Like Qin Sang, they found themselves unable to identify many of the creatures.  This couldn't possibly be summoned by the East Sea tribes.  Even if the entire Demon Realm mustered its forces, it wouldn't be able to assemble such a horde.</p><p>"This… this seems to be a Golden Spiral Turtle of the Ancient Xuan Turtle Clan," someone exclaimed, pointing at a turtle-like beast. "I heard from a fellow cultivator from the aquatic tribes that the Golden Spiral Turtle was once one of the strongest clans in the East Sea, rivalling the dragons in power, but their bloodline was extinguished in a great upheaval. They've been extinct for ages! How can there be such a large one here?"</p><p>One by one, others identified extinct creatures, legendary beings thought to exist only in ancient texts.</p><p>Soon, more and more anomalies were discovered.  The presence of so many ancient and legendary demonic beasts was impossible. It was as if they had somehow traveled back to the ancient era, an age where demonic tribes flourished, where the Demon Court ruled the world, or even earlier.</p><p>"Something's not right!" someone shouted. "These aren't real beasts! They must be illusions!"</p><p>Qin Sang, aided by his Sky-Eyed Butterfly, was likely among the first to notice the anomaly. The beasts might be illusions, but their aura was undeniably real. They had to be treated as genuine enemies.</p><p>"Stay behind us,"</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely, transmitting his words to Liuli. He stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Yuanxiang clan leader and Yuan Ren, while Liuli took a step back.</p><p>Suddenly, another shout rang out. "Look there!"</p><p>Everyone followed the direction, and those with sharp eyes saw a figure flash between the beasts.</p><p>"It's one of those grey beings!  Something's definitely wrong!"</p><p>Further searches revealed two more grey figures. Unlike the ones encountered before, these seemed intelligent, skillfully hiding within the horde, moving erratically instead of charging recklessly.</p><p>The beast horde seemed to be under their command. Whether these were the same grey figures that had undergone a transformation or different ones entirely remained unclear.</p><p>Discussion erupted among the cultivators, as they prepared to engage the horde with their respective techniques.  However, the appearance of the grey figures cast a shadow over their hearts, making them hesitate.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang noticed a flash of light within the dark mass of beasts, and others quickly followed suit.</p><p>"A fellow cultivator is trapped! Save them!"</p><p>Without hesitation, regardless of clan affiliation, everyone sprang into action. A fierce battle was inevitable; the more people fighting, the better.  Other grievances could wait.</p><p>Streams of light shot towards the horde like arrows, instantly obliterating the foremost beasts without leaving a trace, confirming that they were illusions.</p><p>The combined effort of the cultivators carved a path through the horde, and the light emerged, revealing more than ten people, several of whom Qin Sang recognized.</p><p>"Eh? Qin Zhenren!"  Ji Xia flew towards him, still shaken. "Goodness! I almost died in there!  I almost didn't get to see Qin Zhenren again!"</p><p>Besides Ji Xia, Si Huang and Shao Shi were also present, but the rest of the Siyou clan, and the celestial child, were nowhere to be seen.  Si Huang and Shao Shi spotted Qin Sang but deliberately avoided his gaze and flew off in another direction.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, considering directly questioning them through voice transmission, but decided to hold back for now.</p><p></p>
