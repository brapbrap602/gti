<h1>Chapter 680: The Divine Wood Dilemma</h1><p>Everyone chatted happily. Zou Lao and the others wanted to hold a banquet, but Qin Sang declined.</p><p>After resting in the cave dwelling for a night, Qin Sang returned to the fire chamber the next day and asked Ran Luo to send over the spiritual materials accumulated in the merchant association. His refining skills were clearly superior to the thin young man's. Ran Luo delivered top-tier materials, allowing Qin Sang to focus on crafting supreme-grade magical artifacts.</p><p>While helping the merchant association refine artifacts, Qin Sang effortlessly obtained many rare spiritual materials for practice, rapidly improving his refining skills. It was a win-win situation.</p><p>While waiting for Ran Luo to deliver the materials in the fire chamber, Qin Sang summoned the Ebony Sword and took out a piece of spiritual wood from his Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>This was the heartwood of a Jiao Mountain Tree, a precious spiritual wood comparable to Coldgold, which Qin Sang found in Du Han's Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was only a low-grade magical treasure. According to the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter", low-grade magical treasures could only hold six Killing Talismans at most.</p><p>If the Ebony Sword's quality couldn't be improved, it would become a bottleneck hindering his breakthrough when he reached the late stage of Core Formation.</p><p>He didn't know how many spiritual materials it would take to upgrade the Ebony Sword from a low-grade to a mid-grade magical treasure. Apart from the top ten Divine Woods, other spiritual woods provided limited improvement, only allowing for gradual accumulation.</p><p>Qin Sang knew it was best to start early, lest the Ebony Sword truly become an obstacle.</p><p>However, the Ebony Sword couldn't be used in combat while absorbing spiritual wood.</p><p>After forming his core in the Bear Mountain region, Qin Sang planned to hunt demons in the depths of the Western Frontier.</p><p>He'd been traveling continuously afterward and was worried about encountering unexpected dangers on the road.</p><p>Therefore, although Qin Sang had several pieces of high-quality spiritual wood, he never had the chance to let the Ebony Sword absorb them.</p><p>Refining for the Qiongyu Merchant Association and staying on Capital Rock Island ensured his safety. The merchant association had accumulated a considerable number of demon corpses, enough for at least six months, so Qin Sang took the opportunity to let the Ebony Sword absorb a few more pieces of spiritual wood.</p><p>Guided by his True Essence, the Jiao Mountain Tree heartwood floated in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>The wood was pure white, as pristine as snow.</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang suspended the Ebony Sword above the Jiao Mountain Tree heartwood. Sword Qi materialized, enveloping the heartwood.</p><p>With his current understanding of refining, Qin Sang easily grasped the characteristics of the Jiao Mountain Tree heartwood. The Sword Qi gently penetrated the heartwood, removing impurities.</p><p>Soon, only the purest essence of the spiritual wood remained.</p><p>A faint smile appeared on Qin Sang's lips. He pointed at the Ebony Sword, and a suction force erupted from the sword, absorbing the spiritual wood essence completely.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was already a magical treasure, so suppressing the essence of the Jiao Mountain Tree heartwood wasn't difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang looked relaxed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the moment the Ebony Sword completely absorbed the spiritual wood essence, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>As if something had been triggered, the originally snow-white essence with a faint cyan tinge suddenly gained a bloody hue, which spread with lightning speed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the spiritual wood essence lost all its spirituality, turning into waste!</p><p>The Ebony Sword returned to its original state!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically, a sense of foreboding rising in his heart.</p><p>This was clearly the polluting power of the Boundless Bloodwood!</p><p>When the spiritual wood essence contacted the Ebony Sword's core, its inferior quality made it unable to resist the Boundless Bloodwood's polluting power, thus rendering it useless.</p><p>This was something Qin Sang hadn't anticipated.</p><p>Before Core Formation, when Qin Sang tried to let the Ebony Sword absorb spiritual wood, similar situations had occurred.</p><p>But he'd attributed it to his insufficient cultivation and inability to control the power of the magical treasure. He hadn't taken it seriously, never expecting it to happen after Core Formation.</p><p>With a solemn expression, Qin Sang connected his mind to the Ebony Sword, taking out several other types of spiritual wood and trying them one by one. Without exception, they all failed.</p><p>This seemed to stem from a conflict between the spiritual woods themselves, beyond Qin Sang's control.</p><p>Unable to withstand the Boundless Bloodwood's pollution, the spiritual wood essence lost its spirituality the moment it made contact, let alone being absorbed.</p><p>When the Ebony Sword absorbed the Boundless Bloodwood previously, the Killing Talismans had stabilized the sword, allowing it to resist the polluting power. Now, the new spiritual wood was no match for the Boundless Bloodwood.</p><p>To integrate with the Ebony Sword, the spiritual wood's quality had to be no less than that of the Boundless Bloodwood.</p><p>Whether this was due to the Boundless Bloodwood itself or a characteristic of all Divine Woods, Qin Sang didn't know.</p><p>"This... Does this mean I must find a Divine Wood of the same level as the Boundless Bloodwood to upgrade the Ebony Sword? Those legendary immortal plants are certainly no less than the Divine Woods, but who knows if they truly exist? They're even rarer than the Divine Woods."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, his face grim.</p><p>After arriving at the Boundless Sea, he realized that the Small Cold Region was already a fertile land in the cultivation world, with only three Divine Woods appearing in ten thousand years.</p><p>Although the Boundless Sea was countless times larger than the Small Cold Region, it was much more barren. Where could he find a Divine Wood?</p><p>"Could it be that I must return to the Small Cold Region before reaching the late stage of Core Formation?"</p><p>The Bottomless Valley in the Small Cold Region was the only place where Qin Sang knew a Divine Wood might exist.</p><p>Back then, the entire Boundless Bloodwood had been shattered, its fragments scattered throughout the Bottomless Valley. The Wuji Sect Master and the other person, aided by the Abyss of Sin, had searched extensively within the valley, but there were bound to be some remnants.</p><p>As for refining a new natal spirit sword, Qin Sang didn't dare to attempt it rashly.</p><p>Not to mention the immense difficulty of refining a magical treasure anew, changing his natal spirit sword was equivalent to abandoning the Killing Talismans on the sword. Due to the characteristics of his cultivation technique, the Killing Talismans on his natal spirit sword were closely linked to his cultivation. Qin Sang didn't know what would happen, and he wouldn't gamble unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>"Fortunately, upgrading the Ebony Sword isn't urgent. There's still plenty of time to find a solution before I reach the late stage of Core Formation. Bottleneck, bottleneck... So this is the bottleneck of the 'Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter'!"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly. His previous thoughts had been too naive.</p><p>Divine Woods were incredibly rare. A tangible bottleneck wasn't necessarily easier than an intangible one.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p>"Anything is possible. There might be other ways besides finding a Divine Wood. Perhaps I can find a solution through refining techniques. It seems my choice to learn refining was correct. I'll have to dedicate some effort to improving my refining skills in the future."</p><p>He summoned the Ebony Sword into his palm.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at it for a long time, clueless, but he wasn't discouraged, knowing his refining skills were still rudimentary.</p><p>Just then, a knock came on the stone door of the fire chamber.</p><p>The Qiongyu Merchant Association had delivered the spiritual materials.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew the Ebony Sword into his Primordial Spirit, suppressing his distracting thoughts and focusing on refining.</p><p>He lost track of time in the fire chamber.</p><p>Unknowingly, half a year had passed since Qin Sang arrived on the island.</p><p>For six months, he'd been shuttling between the cave dwelling and the fire chamber, always in a hurry. He hadn't left Capital Rock Island once, crafting one supreme-grade magical artifact after another.</p>
