<h1>***</h1><p>第一千四百六十三章 Xiaoxiang Zi </p><p>"I haven't fully grasped the Auspicious Seal of the First Imprint yet, but I can already use it to fight enemies. With my understanding of the First Imprint, comprehending the Lotus Seal is proceeding more smoothly than expected. Each imprint of the *Seven Teachers Buddha Imprints* is different, but the intrinsic connections are extremely close; the former is the foundation for the latter. Among the Daoist arts I've seen before, there are also similar techniques that have been differentiated, but none are as good as this. I wonder if this is a characteristic of body cultivator divine abilities..."</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his mind from the divine ability and gained some insight.</p><p>He put away the jade scroll, removed the restrictions, and flew out of the chariot with Tong Lingyu. In the east, they saw a black line appearing on the sea, running from north to south and extending to the end of their vision.</p><p>The Hidden Sun Realm of the Northern Sea's Four Realms!</p><p>Tong Lingyu put away the chariot and the fish whistle, and fed the Abyss Whale a few spirit pills as a reward, smiling as she patted the Abyss Whale. "Go back!"</p><p>Perhaps it was because of taking the spirit pills, the Abyss Whale's intelligence had increased. Its eyes were more lively and intelligent. It stared at Tong Lingyu for a while before slowly swimming towards the deep sea.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Streams of water gradually moved away.</p><p>The whale song lingered.</p><p>The Abyss Whale was reluctant to leave, bidding farewell with its cries.</p><p>Tong Lingyu turned around and saw that Qin Sang had been gazing at the Hidden Sun Realm. She said, "This location is in the southern part of the Hidden Sun Realm. We will land here, go directly east, and we will arrive at the Profound Heaven Palace. The Profound Heaven Palace is located on Mount Lingxiao. Around this mountain, seventy-two Cold Springs are naturally formed, forming seventy-two lakes, distributed among the mountains, scattered like stars. They are shrouded in cold mist all year round, and look faint and indistinct from afar. Among them, the Everlasting Spring beneath Mount Lingxiao is the most magical, never freezing despite the freezing weather. The other seventy-one Cold Springs also have their own mysteries..."</p><p>Tong Lingyu invited Qin Sang to set off, introducing the Profound Heaven Palace to Qin Sang as they flew.</p><p>Qin Sang had inquired in many ways before, and now had a clearer impression of the Hidden Sun Realm and the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>The environment of the Hidden Sun Realm is completely different from other places in the Northern Sea.</p><p>It is bitterly cold here all year round, and it only doesn’t snow a quarter of the year. Mortals must race against time to cultivate and harvest; if they are a little late, they will be destroyed by blizzards.</p><p>Therefore, the Hidden Sun Realm has a flat terrain and is quite vast, but it is not densely populated.</p><p>The Hidden Sun Realm originally had many Immortal Sects, just like Crescent Moon Realm, but they were later unified by the Profound Heaven Palace. The other sects either disappeared or were merged into the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>Today, the Profound Heaven Palace is divided into four main branches: Profound Heaven, Heavenly Mountain, Violet Dawn Pavilion, and Snow Listening Tower. It is said that only the Profound Heaven branch is the direct descendant of the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>However, over the years, the past is beyond recall, and there are many errors in the rumors.</p><p>Whether there are rifts within the Profound Heaven Palace, or what hidden dangers exist, outsiders have no way of knowing.</p><p>Qin Sang listened carefully to Tong Lingyu and asked, "Are all four branches on Mount Lingxiao?"</p><p>"Not so."</p><p>Tong Lingyu did not know what Daoist art she used. Just as they flew to the shore, two light cries came from the depths of the snowy mountain, and two exceptionally divine spirit birds flew out of the snow. They were snow-white all over, their feathers like strands of ice silk, dancing around Tong Lingyu.</p><p>The chariot was hung on the spirit birds, flying eastward through the air.</p><p>"Mount Lingxiao is a forbidden area of the Profound Heaven Palace. Only the Palace Master can usually cultivate on Mount Lingxiao. The elders of the Profound Heaven Palace and each hall occupy the seventy-two Springs respectively. Among the four branches, only the Profound Heaven branch is in the seventy-two Springs. Heavenly Mountain, Violet Dawn Pavilion, and Snow Listening Tower are located in other parts of the Hidden Sun Realm, with Snow Listening Tower in the north. Only for major events such as the opening of the Holy Land will all branches gather on Mount Lingxiao."</p><p>Speaking of this, Tong Lingyu sighed softly, "The Demon Race has produced two Great Sages, who are becoming increasingly rampant, repeatedly sneaking into the Hidden Sun Realm and committing many killings. In recent years, experts in the sect have been stationed on the border in shifts, and the seventy-two Springs are no longer as lively as they used to be."</p><p>…</p><p>It was currently the cold season in the Hidden Sun Realm.</p><p>They hadn't flown far before the sky and earth suddenly darkened, and a blizzard began to blow, with biting cold winds.</p><p>However, the external environment did not affect the chariot, which was as warm as spring inside.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down below. The earth was covered in silver, with no trace of human habitation. Occasionally, he could see a few cities when flying, appearing lonely in the boundless sea of snow.</p><p>The scenery was monotonous.</p><p>After looking at it a few times, Qin Sang lost interest and continued to comprehend the *Seven Teachers Buddha Imprints*.</p><p>He did not know how long had passed, but Qin Sang was awakened by the cries of the spirit birds. He only felt the chariot under him pause slightly, and when he looked outside again, the scenery was completely different from before.</p><p>What was presented to him was a snow and ice painting stretching for thousands of miles.</p><p>The snow-capped mountains were continuous, like crouching dragons.</p><p>There were countless cold lakes under the mountains.</p><p>In winter, the cold lakes had all frozen, and under the sunlight, they were like mirrors inlaid on the ground, crystal clear, or like the scales of a dragon.</p><p>The momentum was magnificent, with no end in sight.</p><p>In the deepest part of the field of vision, there was a vague majestic mountain shadow, towering into the clouds.</p><p>Around the snow-capped mountains and cold lakes, there was a faint cold mist floating, which was very thin and would not block the line of sight.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense that these cold mists were not simple, containing the power of spirit formations. The range of the Profound Heaven Palace's protective formation was so vast, worthy of being the number one sect in the Northern Sea!</p><p>At this time, the spirit birds broke free from the ropes, turned their heads together and cried at Tong Lingyu, and flew into the snow mountain and disappeared.</p><p>"That is Mount Lingxiao," Tong Lingyu pointed to the mountain shadow, "The treasure vault is in the Azure White Spring, one of the seventy-two Springs. We will go to the treasure vault to pick treasures first. After that, this palace will do its best to be a host. I hope Qin Fellow Daoist doesn't mind any neglect."</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang did not regret it.</p><p>She would soon be able to recover the sacred object, and Tong Lingyu's expression was also a bit more relaxed.</p><p>Being able to get the treasure, how could Qin Sang mind these things?</p><p>He followed Tong Lingyu into the great formation and flew straight towards Mount Lingxiao. The cold mist was thick, and he could only vaguely see the scenery on Mount Lingxiao.</p><p>This mountain was lush and green, and it was still full of spring even in the depths of winter. There were some pavilions and towers distributed among them, all of which were crystal clear and made of mysterious ice, which was quite peculiar.</p><p>When they were about to reach Mount Lingxiao, Tong Lingyu stopped in the air above a lake.</p><p>This cold lake had already frozen, and the lake water was half blue and half white.</p><p>Tong Lingyu took out a token, infused it with true essence, waved her hand gently, and the token shot out a phantom, turning into a stream of light and disappearing under the ice.</p><p>After a while, a hole silently melted out of the ice surface, and an ice staircase extended to the bottom of the lake.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu flashed into the ice cave, and Qin Sang followed closely behind. He did not go far before his vision suddenly widened, and the ice staircase was connected to the Mysterious Ice Great Hall.</p><p>"Greetings, Grand Elder."</p><p>A person turned out from the depths of the hall and bowed to Tong Lingyu.</p><p>This person was hunched over, with white hair and a rickety body, looking very old.</p><p>Tong Lingyu hurriedly stepped forward to support him, calling out, "Martial Uncle Lu..."</p><p>Her lips moved slightly, but no sound came out, and she communicated with this Martial Uncle Lu in secret.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance with his hands behind his back, looking around the hall, silently observing the old man. He was secretly awe-struck. The old man was also an Early Nascent Soul Realm expert, and his cultivation was probably not much worse than Tong Lingyu's.</p><p>The old man lacked vigor and his vitality was declining. It was unknown if he had been injured.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that he might have barely survived the last Heavenly Tribulation, narrowly escaping death, but left behind hidden injuries. Because he was approaching his life limit, he did not dare to take action easily.</p><p>However, such cultivators should not be underestimated once they are forced to fight desperately, as they are the foundation of the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>He did not know how Tong Lingyu explained it to this person.</p><p>The old man raised his shriveled eyelids, glanced at Qin Sang, stretched out his finger, and pointed to the ice wall at the back of the hall. Then he turned and left, his voice hoarse, "Grand Elder, please help yourself."</p><p>"Thank you for your trouble, Martial Uncle Lu."</p><p>Tong Lingyu watched the old man's back disappear, and signaled Qin Sang to follow her into the ice wall.</p><p>At this time, the ice wall became transparent, and it was the entrance to the treasure vault.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the treasure vault without any hindrance. He only saw rows of shelves, filling the treasure vault, and countless rare treasures were displayed on them, with precious light shining, reflecting each other.</p><p>Qin Sang could not help but think of an appropriate sentence: The myriad flowers are about to dazzle the eyes.</p><p>Tong Lingyu turned around and saw Qin Sang standing in place, looking around non-stop, and smiled quite contentedly, "Fellow Daoist can choose any three treasures from these treasures."</p><p>Jadeite Essence, Cloud Soul Crystal, Earth Rot Bone...</p><p>Crimson Dragon Saliva, Azure Spirit Ginseng, Shaman Fruit...</p><p>Bottles of elixirs.</p><p>Magical artifacts and treasures.</p><p>Jade scrolls.</p><p>...</p><p>Rare and exotic treasures that are rare outside are placed together here like goods. Although these treasures are not extremely precious to Qin Sang, the sheer number of them displayed in front of him is shocking enough.</p><p>Moreover, this is only the entrance to the treasure vault.</p><p>Qin Sang only looked, and did not move anything. He walked forward slowly while looking.</p><p>Tong Lingyu followed silently behind, very patiently. She knew that Qin Sang would definitely not be interested in these things.</p><p>The further into the treasure vault, the higher the value of the treasures, and the rarer they became.</p><p>"If I bring all these back, the Azure Goat Temple will definitely become the number one sect in the Northern Chen Realm in the future. When I break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, I might be able to unify the Northern Chen Realm."</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly had this thought, and could not help but laugh at himself secretly, as his ambition was not here.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the deepest part of the treasure vault. Qin Sang had not taken anything yet. Seeing the arched Mysterious Ice door blocking the way, he turned back and asked Tong Lingyu with his eyes.</p><p>Tong Lingyu stepped forward and opened the archway, reminding Qin Sang, "This is the inner vault. If the treasures in the inner vault cannot satisfy Fellow Daoist, no one else can give you better conditions."</p><p>"Qin is not a greedy person."</p><p>Qin Sang said lightly, and stepped into the inner vault.</p><p>The space of the inner vault was much smaller than the outside, but the treasures were more precious.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang glanced over, he saw a jade bottle, his expression slightly changed, he strode over and observed it through the restriction.</p><p>The jade bottle contained a clear, water-like spiritual liquid.</p><p>In the center of the spiritual liquid, there was a tiny vortex that was constantly rotating, and wisps of aura were emitted, adhering to the inside of the jade bottle, forming a layer of snowflake-like frost.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist knows this thing? We have tried it, but it cannot be used to refine tools, and we don't know what kind of elixirs need it to be refined. Seeing that its phenomenon is extraordinary, we put it here..."</p><p>Tong Lingyu walked over and asked Qin Sang for advice.</p><p>"This is Yin Essence Water."</p><p>Qin Sang said, "Qin once saw it in an ancient book..."</p><p>Yin Essence Water, one of the three most important spiritual objects for the Soul Ascension Ritual.</p><p>Valley Master Mu had described the characteristics of Yin Essence Water in detail. Whether it is a drop or more, a small vortex will be born in the middle of the Yin Essence Water, which is constantly rotating and very easy to identify.</p><p>There were probably four drops in the jade bottle.</p><p>Qin Sang was not originally prepared to use this opportunity to exchange for the spiritual objects of the Soul Ascension Ritual, but looking at so much Yin Essence Water, he hesitated a little. This thing was rare, and Hundred Flowers Valley probably could not take out much to exchange.</p><p>After hesitating for a while, Qin Sang did not rashly take away the Yin Essence Water, preparing to look at other things first.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was looking forward to Qin Sang choosing the Yin Essence Water. She knew that Qin Sang's words were untrue, but the Profound Heaven Palace did not know how to use this thing, and it was no different from waste here.</p><p>With a turn of his figure, Qin Sang walked towards the location where the jade slips were placed, and Tong Lingyu immediately pointed out the *Frigid Nether Returning Yin Jade Chapter* for him.</p><p>It turned out that its real name was only the four words *Frigid Nether Returning Yin*. Because it was recorded on a palm-sized jade screen, the disciples of the Profound Heaven Palace added the two words 'Jade Chapter' by themselves.</p><p>The jade screen was slightly curved, and hundreds of small characters were engraved on the surface, which was the general outline of the secret technique.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned it once, and there was no difference from what Liu Li had introduced before.</p><p>After reading it, Qin Sang was already inclined to choose this extra-corporeal incarnation secret technique, but he still turned his eyes to check other jade slips.</p><p>Qin Sang had his own experience in searching for cultivation techniques and secret techniques. It was best to use the Jade Buddha to avoid danger and loopholes, so as to achieve cultivation effects that others could not reach.</p><p>Unfortunately, after entering the path of immortality for hundreds of years, Qin Sang had only obtained a few techniques such as the *Primal Spirit Sword Nourishing Chapter*.</p><p>There were quite a few jade slips here, more than half of which were related to the Way of Frigid Ice.</p><p>After looking through them roughly, Qin Sang did not find anything that met his requirements, so he used the token Tong Lingyu gave him and reached out to touch the restriction on the surface of the jade screen.</p><p>"*Frigid Nether Returning Yin*, I want it."</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A stream of light disappeared into Qin Sang's eyebrows, and the entire secret technique was deeply imprinted in his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang confirmed that the secret technique was complete, his mind returned, and he continued to choose the second item.</p><p>There were several kinds of spiritual materials here that could continue to improve the Golden Submerged Sword, but they were not of great significance to Qin Sang. If he could not find what he needed, Qin Sang prepared to use the remaining two conditions to exchange for Yin Essence Water and Flood Dragon Pearl.</p><p>As his thoughts turned, Qin Sang quickly browsed through most of the treasure vault. He was about to go to the other side when he suddenly discovered a familiar object on a shelf in the middle of the treasure vault.</p><p>His gaze condensed, and a strong surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p>It was actually a crystal-clear seven-story pagoda!</p><p>The shape and size were roughly the same as the seven-story pagoda he obtained in the main hall of the Pure Sea Sect. The only difference was that his seven-story pagoda was colorful and radiant, like Buddha's light, while this seven-story pagoda was pure and transparent, as if carved from Mysterious Ice.</p><p>"Could it be that a set of treasures has been scattered and needs to be collected to be activated?"</p><p>Qin Sang intuitively felt that there must be a connection between the two pagodas. On the surface, he remained calm, scanning his gaze over other treasures, slowly approaching the seven-story pagoda.</p><p>Just then, he suddenly caught a glimpse of a slightly yellowed portrait hanging on the innermost wall of the treasure vault.</p><p>The person in the painting had the demeanor of an immortal, outstanding and extraordinary.</p><p>It was the same person as the statue enshrined in the Buddha Hall of the Pure Sea Sect!</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was shocked.</p><p>What was the relationship between the Pure Sea Sect and the Profound Heaven Palace that they enshrined the same person? The Buddhist Sect of the Boundless Sea was born, Tong Lingyu should have received the news, why was she indifferent?</p><p>Too many doubts arose in his mind. He turned his head to look at Tong Lingyu, pointed to the portrait, and asked curiously, "Fellow Daoist Tong, this painting does not seem to be a magical treasure. I wonder who the senior in the painting is?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu stepped forward, saw the portrait, and replied: "This is Senior Xiaoxiang Zi."</p>
