  Chapter 810 - Ultimate Knowledge—Mechanical Life Tinder!

 <div class="chapter-c" id="calibre_link-2197">
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao did not arrive quietly but made it known to everyone. The
          army’s subdivision sent an announcement to all its members to welcome
          the arrival of their Army Commander. The many new faction members all
          went to watch. They had heard a lot about Black Star of the Shattered
          Star Ring, but never had they seen this big boss with their own eyes.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   On Planet Gilman and in the army’s subdivision, countless players
          witnessed a spaceship flying out from the blue stargate and
          approaching the subdivision.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Whoosh!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The spaceship flew toward the entrance of the dock, then linked with
          the electromagnetic rails and entered the wide dock.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The dock was already filled with players. Countless people broadcast
          the event to the forums with excitement.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   As the hatch opened, wearing a black robe, Han Xiao walked out with a
          few hovering guards behind his head. He smiled and connected to the
          quantum network with his mind.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The next moment, Han Xiao’s face appeared on the communicators of the
          countless people present.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I’m Black Star. Welcome to the army.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   His voice emerged simultaneously throughout all the communicators and
          mixed into one sound with echoes. It felt grand.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The people were shocked. They had never seen a high-level Mechanic
          hack into so many communicators instantly, and it even looked easy.
          Unlike the old players in the Shattered Star Ring who had been
          alongside Han Xiao for three versions, the people there had only met
          Calamity Grades at most during their storylines. This was the first
          time that they had come in close contact with a Beyond Grade A.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Having heard so many rumors about Han Xiao on the forums, the
          Constellation Corridor players had a lot of thoughts about Han Xiao.
          Through seeing Han Xiao with their own eyes for the first time, the
          initial image that Han Xiao had given them was unfathomable.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Vodka was mixed in the crowd and used the [Detect] ability on Han
          Xiao. The players around all did the same.

  <p class="calibre5">
   “All question marks, as expected,” Vodka murmured softly.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Ames followed right after and stood alongside Han Xiao. Hila and the
          others followed them down as well.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Ames looked around at the countless people around. Then she glanced at
          Han Xiao and said with a faint smile, “Congratulations, your army has
          expanded again.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “That doesn’t sound very sincere,” Han Xiao joked.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Suddenly, a change occurred!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Pa!
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   A strong light suddenly appeared in the crowd and blinded the people’s
          sights.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Boom!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Dozens of people dashed out from the crowd and suddenly attacked Han
          Xiao and the others together. All kinds of cannons, spells, and Esper
          Abilities were thrown toward them.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   With an expressionless face, Hila took a step forward and tapped her
          fingers. Dark red energy beams shot out like lightning and penetrated
          all those people’s bodies in an instant, killing them with ease.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The next moment, those attackers turned into white light and
          disappeared—they were players.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao’s lips twitched, but he was not surprised.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Although he had tons of players working for the army, he had never
          forgotten the fact that ‘players’ were the representation of anarchy.
          There would always be a group of people that would cause trouble for
          all sorts of reasons. Since a big boss like him had appeared, dozens
          of funny players decided to attack him without thinking of the
          consequences.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The Chinese players back in the Shattered Star Ring who had known him
          for three versions would never do something like this, but the army
          was new to the Constellation Corridor. Furthermore, the players there
          were daring foreigners who loved to try out all kinds of
          possibilities.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The players were startled before they exchanged looks after regaining
          focus.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Some people had actually attacked the Beyond Grade A boss, Black Star,
          knowing that they would never succeed. What a group of gamblers! The
          players there had just joined the army, so they were not angered by
          this.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The question marks on the character information did not give them too
          strong an image, but when the officers beside Black Star easily
          slaughtered dozens of Grade B players, the players realized the power
          difference. Some players who had initially harbored ulterior motives
          but had yet to make a move secretly gave up those thoughts.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This kind of boss was stronger than all the NPCs they had ever seen.
          They would probably die instantly if they tried to attack him.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Among the Constellation Corridor players who had joined the army,
          there were definitely some time bombs, which Han Xiao was not
          surprised about. He told Phillip a few words in his mind, and Phillip
          immediately issued a wanted status to those attackers through the army
          assistant program. The army subdivision was completely under Phillip’s
          surveillance, so finding out who those attackers were was a piece of
          cake.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Ding!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   A notification popped up immediately on the players’ communicators.
          They were shocked to see the wanted order.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “The people earlier are wanted, and there’s a reward for killing them
          every time!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I seem to know a few of them. I even added them as friends.”
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Whoa, even their coordinates are on the communicator. They’ve revived
          right here on Planet Gilman.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Hehe…”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Most people gloated. Having seen the consequences of attacking the
          army’s officers, some people who had intended to do so gave up.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Being wanted by the army meant those attackers became red named
          players to the army members and would be chased by countless players.
          Their future… looked grim.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao was already very familiar with this process. Not only did the
          attackers not anger him, but they made him feel delighted. They were
          basically handing him a pillow when he was sleepy—they were great
          friends who sacrificed themselves to help Han Xiao build a reputation!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   How nice of them!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Through this, the players of the Constellation Corridor would know
          that there were consequences for causing trouble!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This small interlude did not stir up any storm. Han Xiao looked around
          at the players and crossed the crowd with Ames and the others.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The players all stepped back and gave way, watching Han Xiao leave,
          before gradually leaving the dock themselves.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao pondered on the way.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “The Constellation Corridor players have no sense of belonging to the
          army, of course. Profit and benefits are the main reason they’ve
          joined. I will let people slowly teach them the army’s history to
          strengthen their unity…”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He was not planning to personally build relationships with these
          people like he did back in the Shattered Star Ring. There were a few
          reasons for that.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Firstly, through all these years, the Black Star Army had already
          built its appeal through its power, image, fame, brand, and many other
          factors. This was the main tool to attract the players. The faction
          store could basically satisfy all the needs of the players. As long as
          they spent in the faction store, they would bring him profit. He did
          not have to do things personally.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Secondly, too many players wanted to farm his Favorability to trigger
          missions or learn abilities. Hence, they always came to chat with him
          in groups and gave him gifts. Han Xiao did not want to be accepting
          gifts his every waking second.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The third reason was his identity. As the army commander, it should
          not be too easy for most people to contact him, as the level system in
          the army had to be maintained. Therefore, Han Xiao had long set a rule
          that only those who had accumulated a certain amount of Contribution
          Points and were at the middle level among all the members could
          request to see the army commander or the army’s high-level officers.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   To the players, this was a chance to learn abilities from these
          characters. Han Xiao used this player mindset to increase their
          passion to farm the Contribution Points by doing missions, giving them
          chances to farm Favorability with the officers of the army. They would
          only be able to learn special abilities from characters when the
          Favorability was high enough. This basically made the Favorability of
          him and the officers a rare item to the players, so the players would
          put in more effort for them.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Having farmed leeks for more than a decade, Han Xiao was already a
          complete pro at these things.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Currently, most of the Constellation Corridor players are still
          considering whether to stay or leave. I shall stay here for around a
          month before I leave so that they have enough time to consider. At the
          same time, I’ll wait for the Crimson Dynasty to prepare the troops to
          explore the Flickering World.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   …
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Initially, Han Xiao thought him being attacked by the Constellation
          Corridor players was just a trivial matter. But to his surprise, it
          caused an impact beyond his expectations on the forums—it made the
          Chinese players in the Shattered Star Ring very displeased.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Throughout three versions, the Chinese players had the deepest
          emotional connection with the Black Star Army and saw it as their main
          faction. As the army commander, Han Xiao was their recognized faction
          leader.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   However, when their army commander went to another Star Field to
          recruit more members, he was attacked by the players over there. It
          made the Chinese players feel that this was an insult to the army
          commander’s kind intentions.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Although they knew this would never cause any danger to the army
          commander, many Chinese players found it unacceptable. It was like
          something they loved being treated roughly by an outsider. This
          stimulated their unity, and the atmosphere on the forums changed very
          quickly, resulting in intense arguments between two sides.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   However, this did not affect Han Xiao’s plan. He still stayed in the
          Planet Gilman subdivision with the others and waited for the players
          to gather and make up their minds.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Of course, he was not just waiting. While waiting, he spent his days
          in the mechanical workshop, expanding his mechanical army and
          inventing new high-level machinery blueprints.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After settling down for two days, Han Xiao contacted the Crimson
          Dynasty’s people and requested an Ultimate Knowledge. This time, the
          dynasty did not reject him. By spending 6,000 Contribution Points, he
          finally obtained the first Ultimate Knowledge that he had been wanting
          for a very long time.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Energy Branch—[Mechanical Life Tinder]!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This was the prerequisite knowledge to activate the core ability of
          Emperor Mechanic, [King’s Mentor].
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The class knowledge tree of the Mechanic class was divided into five
          levels—Basic, Advanced, High-End, Cutting-Edge, and Ultimate. Their
          impact on a Mechanic increased as the levels increased. As the
          highest-level class knowledge, every single Ultimate Knowledge was
          able to provide completely over the top changes to a Mechanic in a
          certain field!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   For example, this knowledge gave Mechanics the real ability to turn
          machinery into mechanical lives. It was basically the ability of a
          live-creating God!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This ability could turn machinery from lifeless objects into living
          units. To put it simply, they would no longer have Item Details on the
          interface but Character Information, like NPCs. They would have
          levels, attributes, abilities, and could keep leveling up with
          complete growth potential. They could even grow into elite models or
          even boss models!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Of course, good things were never cheap. Not mentioning the difficulty
          in learning any Ultimate Knowledge, just the Potential Point cost of
          learning one was very expensive.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The cost of learning knowledges originally increased by one at every
          level—one point for Basic, two points for Advanced, three points for
          High-End, and four points for Cutting-Edge. The cost to learn Ultimate
          Knowledges, however, instantly doubled and required eight Potential
          Points. This was just the cost of the main branch knowledges. If it
          was from another branch, it would triple just like before and become
          twenty-four Potential Points!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao was a Virtual Mechanic, and [Mechanical Life Tinder] was the
          Ultimate Knowledge of the Energy Branch, so the cost to level it up
          was indeed twenty-four Potential Points every level.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   It was extremely difficult for normal players to obtain twenty-four
          Potential Points. Other than leveling up, the way for Mechanic players
          to obtain Potential Points was basically to level up blueprint
          abilities to the max level one after another, which needed tons of
          Experience.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Therefore, to the Mechanic players in the later stages, they did
          missions and earned Experience to level up their abilities and get Potential
          Points. They would have to continue earning Experience even if they had
          reached the maximum level allowed in the version.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Usually, only extremely high skilled players or professional players
          had such high needs. However, professional players had their clubs to
          train their accounts for them, so it would not be too tiring. For
          casual players, however, they had no choice but to give and take. Most
          Mechanic players only learned the Ultimate Knowledge for their own
          branch.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Things were different for the Great Mechanic Han. The outrageously
          expensive Potential Point cost for Ultimate Knowledges of other
          branches was more than enough to make the players despair, but it was
          not unbearable for him.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He had leeks!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Due to the penalty from using the Evolution Cube, Han Xiao had not
          leveled up at all lately. He had stocked up on a ton of Experience, which had
          now come into use. He opened the interface, picked out many blueprint
          abilities, and spent Experience to level them up to max level one after
          another.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   On the interface, his Potential Points kept growing little by little,
          finally reaching twenty-four. This cost him quite a lot of Experience.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   As the total level of the character increased, the level up cost of
          the low-level abilities would also grow. The players could choose to
          slowly level up to reduce that cost, but it would cost a few problems.
          Firstly, there were too many blueprints, and the low-level blueprints
          would be obsolete as the players’ level increased. Secondly, they
          would only be able to do the corresponding level missions if they did
          not level up, so the speed of earning Experience would naturally be slower
          than higher level players. Once they were behind, it would be very
          difficult to catch up. Therefore, there were pros and cons to not
          leveling up, and it depended on the individual.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Usually, only those who made smurf accounts, such as account boosters
          like the Great Mechanic Han, would choose to earn more Potential
          Points and not level up.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Ever since the beginning, however, Han Xiao had been destined to never
          walk that path.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Twenty-two, twenty-three… twenty-four!” Seeing that he had sufficient
          Potential Points, Han Xiao immediately used all of them to learn the
          Ultimate Knowledge.
