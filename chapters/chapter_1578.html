<h1></h1><p>The snowy landscape vanished.</p><p>The sky was still overcast, but the snowflakes were gone, the snow no longer falling.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself amidst raging winds and towering waves, tossed about like a leaf in a storm.</p><p>Whether it was the surrounding scenery or the crashing sounds of the waves, everything was indistinguishable from a real ocean. Regardless of whether Elder Yanshan himself was proficient in the art of illusion, this protective mountain formation was truly a masterpiece.</p><p>At least, with Qin Sang's avatar's spiritual sense, it would be difficult to find any flaws within it in a short period.</p><p>He had to be capable of breaking this illusion to have any hope of capturing the Snowfox.</p><p>Qin Sang could understand Elder Yanshan's lack of interest now.</p><p>As thoughts flickered through his mind, Qin Sang casually formed a hand seal, pressed it to his forehead, closed his eyes, then opened them. A faint azure light flickered within his pupils, his gaze burning as he scanned the surroundings.</p><p>The azure light in his pupils was naturally a disguise.</p><p>The true power lay with the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's actions, Elder Yanshan assumed that Qin Sang was ready. He secretly altered the formation, and the giant waves surging towards Qin Sang instantly intensified several times over.</p><p>'Boom...'</p><p>The waves crashed down.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered in and out of existence amidst the churning water.</p><p>Within a three-zhang radius around him, the snowflakes formed from saber energy, instead of being dispersed by the waves, danced faster and faster, becoming increasingly dense.</p><p>As the waves touched the snowflakes, they instantly froze, then shattered into countless ice shards under the impact of the saber energy.</p><p>The broken ice fell into the water.</p><p>Countless ice chunks floated on the surface, bobbing up and down, only to be swept up by new waves. Every change appeared so real, without a single flaw.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but admire it.</p><p>Wave after wave.</p><p>The onslaught was relentless.</p><p>Elder Yanshan seemed to have exhausted his tricks, resorting to only this one attack.</p><p>Within a few breaths, Qin Sang unleashed over a hundred saber strikes. Not a single drop of water could penetrate the barrier of saber energy, leaving Qin Sang completely unharmed.</p><p>'Crash!'</p><p>Another wave crashed down.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively used the Snow-Treading Divine Saber to defend. Suddenly, he noticed that within the depths of the wave, spheres of white water spontaneously formed, drifting with the current.</p><p>Seeing these seemingly weightless water spheres, Qin Sang felt a faint sense of danger emanating from them.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened, his saber technique abruptly changing as he slashed around himself with lightning speed.</p><p>At the very moment Qin Sang struck, these water spheres suddenly shot out of the water without any hesitation, all aimed at Qin Sang, swift as lightning.</p><p>These weren't water spheres at all, but Water Divine Thunderbolts!</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang was engulfed by divine thunder.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>...</p><p>All the thunderbolts exploded simultaneously, deafeningly loud.</p><p>Qin Sang vanished, replaced by a cloud of white mist. Lightning flashed within the mist, and destructive energy radiated from the center of the explosion.</p><p>Although the power of this attack was formidable, it wasn't enough to injure Qin Sang.</p><p>At this moment, the Snow-Treading Divine Saber hovered upside down above Qin Sang's head, its blade vibrating rapidly as saber energy enveloped him, warding off the divine thunder. He knew clearly that this was Elder Yanshan's attempt to obscure his vision.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>At the instant of the divine thunder's explosion, a pale blue shadow silently appeared behind Qin Sang, raising a palm to strike at Qin Sang's back.</p><p>The shadow's movements were incredibly subtle, its form blending into the divine thunder, making it difficult to discern. However, its actions couldn't escape the eyes of the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly turned, the Snow-Treading Divine Saber humming as its blade light surged, fast as a meteor, instantly descending upon the shadow's head.</p><p>Upon being discovered by Qin Sang, the shadow immediately abandoned its attack, its palm not even having time to fully rise, as it allowed the Snow-Treading Divine Saber to cleave it in two.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The illusion dissipated, the giant waves, divine thunder, and the shadow vanishing simultaneously.</p><p>Elder Yanshan reappeared opposite Qin Sang, his eyes gleaming with admiration. He praised, "My Shadow-Brushing Escape Technique, even without the aid of this formation, is quite a decent concealment technique. Yet, it was easily seen through by Fellow Daoist before I even had a chance to strike. I now believe in Fellow Daoist's abilities."</p><p>The performance was complete.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his saber, the azure light in his eyes gradually fading. He said, "Fellow Daoist's Shadow-Brushing Escape Technique is truly remarkable. I was able to detect it because I had made prior preparations; otherwise, it would have been difficult to avoid that strike."</p><p>Elder Yanshan chuckled. "Fellow Daoist need not be modest. I know my own limits. Since we have an agreement, I will accompany you on this journey."</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed. "When does Fellow Daoist plan to depart?"</p><p>Shaking his head slightly, Elder Yanshan said, "Not so fast. The place where the Snowfox roams is still some distance from here, and the heavy snow makes it difficult to pinpoint its range. Furthermore, I also need to make some preparations. To be honest with Fellow Daoist, I have always been fascinated by the Snowfox. There must be a reason why such a strange creature exists in this world. After capturing the Snowfox, I will also want a share of the treasures obtained."</p><p>Elder Yanshan openly stated his request.</p><p>This, on the contrary, put Qin Sang at ease.</p><p>This way, they became partners. Qin Sang didn't need to rack his brains thinking about what treasures to offer in exchange. Elder Yanshan would definitely put in his utmost effort.</p><p>He only sought more Han Crystals; it wouldn't matter if the other treasures went to Elder Yanshan.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the thick dark clouds in the sky. "When will this snow calamity end?"</p><p>Elder Yanshan scoffed. "The snow calamities here often last for thirty to fifty years. Fellow Daoist presumably cannot wait that long. I estimate that the snowfall will be weakest in half a year. Let's set off then..."</p><p>The two spoke as they descended the mountain peak.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Elder Yanshan was the only person on Mount Yan.</p><p>He didn't take disciples, nor did he have subordinates awaiting his commands. There wasn't even a single spiritual beast in sight, which explained why there wasn't even anyone to serve tea earlier.</p><p>Elder Yanshan personally led Qin Sang to a cave entrance. "My humble abode is simple. Please bear with me for a few days, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>"It's no trouble. I appreciate your hospitality."</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his thanks. He channeled his True Essence into a blade, carving out a cave dwelling and simple stone tables and stools.</p><p>The two were not fussy, sitting down to discuss the Dao.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that Elder Yanshan possessed profound attainments in the Water Dao, which extended to the Ice Dao, allowing him to speak eloquently on the subject, benefiting Qin Sang immensely.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar's knowledge stemmed from the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>The Central Continent didn't have a lineage like the Xuan Tian Palace. Although Qin Sang concealed the most profound aspects, Elder Yanshan still repeatedly expressed his delight and astonishment.</p><p>After their exchange, the initial formality between them dissipated. When Elder Yanshan rose to take his leave, he was already addressing Qin Sang as "Dao Brother."</p><p>After seeing Elder Yanshan off, Qin Sang closed the cave dwelling, sat cross-legged on the ground, a contemplative look on his face.</p><p>Outside Mount Yan.</p><p>His true body was hidden in an even more spartan cave, having been in meditative seclusion for a long time.</p><p>Elder Yanshan's cave was located on the eastern side of Mount Yan.</p><p>He walked back to his cave along the stone steps and activated the restrictive formation.</p><p>The cave was relatively tidy, but it appeared quite old, lacking even tables and chairs. There was only a silk meditation cushion and an incense burner, perfectly fitting the image of an ascetic cultivator.</p><p>Elder Yanshan sat on the cushion, lost in thought.</p><p>He rested one hand on his knee, the other hanging naturally, his fingers lightly tapping the ground. After a moment, he flicked out a wisp of True Essence, grazing the incense stick and lighting it.</p><p>Staring at the裊裊 smoke, he was lost in thought for a while. Then, Elder Yanshan raised his hand and brushed it across his waist, as if having made a decision. A round mirror appeared in his palm. The mirror was smaller than his palm, fitting perfectly within his grasp.</p><p>The edge of the round mirror was transparent, its texture similar to crystal, with only a few simple markings. The mirror's surface rippled slightly like water.</p><p>Elder Yanshan's face was reflected in the mirror, distorted and deformed.</p><p>He brushed his hand across the mirror's surface, and the face within returned to normal.</p><p>Gazing at the face in the mirror, Elder Yanshan seemed to be conversing with himself, murmuring, "The timing is a bit early. However, he is a good helper..."</p><p>...</p><p>Six months passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>During these six months, Qin Sang's avatar remained on Mount Yan, never venturing out, occasionally emerging from seclusion to observe the changes in the snowfall.</p><p>More mountain peaks had been buried beneath the snow.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how thick the snow layer would accumulate by the time the snow calamity ended. After the snow calamity, there would likely be a flood immediately following, as this area was one of the sources of the Feiyun River.</p><p>It was the polar opposite of the depths of the Western Desert.</p><p>Qin Sang also learned from his conversations with Elder Yanshan that by traveling directly west from here, one could cross land and enter the western Storm Belt.</p><p>The Central Continent only had the North Sea, East Sea, and South Sea, but no West Sea.</p><p>The extreme environments along the edge of the Storm Belt, from the Western Desert to the Northern Barrens, connecting the South Sea and North Sea, were most likely formed under the influence of the Storm Belt.</p><p>Moreover, the Storm Belt wasn't the end of the land. It continued westward, stretching into infinity. At least, Elder Yanshan hadn't reached its end back then. He gave up before he was exhausted, unsure of where the boundary of this landmass lay. Before the storm, it must have been a vast continent.</p><p>Elder Yanshan claimed that deeper within, the earth was torn apart by the storm, apocalyptic scenes everywhere, with no place to shelter, utterly terrifying.</p><p>The agreed-upon time had arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the cave dwelling and observed the weather. The snowfall had indeed lessened, although it still appeared heavy to ordinary people.</p><p>He turned his head to glance at Elder Yanshan's cave dwelling.</p><p>After sealing his cave, Elder Yanshan hadn't been seen for six months, as if he had completely forgotten about his guest, Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang lifted his foot, about to walk over, when the restrictive formation shimmered, and Elder Yanshan pushed open the door.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist is impatient, I see?"</p><p>Elder Yanshan smiled, observing the celestial phenomena, and nodded. "The snowfall is manageable. It should hold for a while. Fellow Daoist, make your preparations. We shall depart immediately."</p><p>"I've been waiting for those words, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang laughed. He had nothing to prepare and quickly followed Elder Yanshan.</p><p>The two flew out of Mount Yan.</p><p>Before leaving Mount Yan, Elder Yanshan looked back at the cultivation grounds where he had spent many years, then turned and left.</p><p>Not long after their departure.</p><p>A figure appeared near Mount Yan, it was Qin Sang's true body.</p><p>The true body paused briefly, then followed behind at a normal pace, neither hurried nor slow, a wisp of demonic fire swirling around his fingertip, not forgetting to cultivate even at this time.</p><p>The two flew side by side.</p><p>Soon, they flew out of the mountain range.</p><p>Elder Yanshan showed no sign of stopping, slightly adjusting his direction and flying swiftly towards the southwest.</p><p>According to Elder Yanshan, although the Northern Barrens were desolate and barren, they were slightly better than the depths of the Western Desert. Many recluses who preferred tranquility and distance from worldly affairs cultivated here in seclusion.</p><p>To avoid attracting attention and causing unnecessary complications, the two concealed their auras, flying low over the snow-covered ground.</p><p>Due to deliberately slowing down their speed, it took them three days to reach their destination.</p><p>When Elder Yanshan pointed it out to him, what Qin Sang saw was an exceptionally vast snowfield.</p><p>The entire snowfield was incredibly flat.</p><p>There shouldn't be any high peaks within the snowfield; any low hills would have long been buried beneath the heavy snow.</p><p>In such a place, without landmarks, one could only rely on their divine sense, penetrating the snow layer, searching bit by bit, inevitably alerting nearby cultivators or demonic beasts.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang frown slightly, Elder Yanshan delivered another piece of bad news. "This entire snowfield is the territory of that Snowfox."</p><p>"If that's the case, what difference does the intensity of the snowfall make? Fellow Daoist must have a way to narrow down the search area, right?" Qin Sang asked calmly.</p><p>"I can't hide anything from Fellow Daoist's discerning eyes."</p><p>Elder Yanshan looked around, fixed his gaze on a particular direction, his figure flashing repeatedly, flying dozens of li before hovering above the snow-covered ground. He formed a claw with one hand and grasped downwards.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A claw shadow tore through the snow layer.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang, who was close behind, heard a '唧唧' screech. Following the sound, he saw a rat-like creature pulled out by the claw shadow.</p><p>This 'rat' had a transparent body, clearly not composed of flesh and blood.</p><p>Elder Yanshan grabbed the 'rat' in his hand and handed it to Qin Sang, pointing downwards. "The ground beneath the snow layer isn't entirely flat. Nearly half of the area is filled with countless bottomless ravines, crisscrossing each other.  A frigid wind blows constantly within these ravines. Although the surface is covered by a layer of snow, the snow can't block the cold wind, so the space below remains empty.  Over the years, a special type of Hanling, a Cold Spirit, has been born within this wind, its body entirely composed of cold Qi..."</p><p>Qin Sang reached out and took it, his heart stirring. He had seen something similar during the competition for the Soul Cleansing Liquid at the Seven Kills Hall, in the final trial.</p><p>He had encountered Earth Spirits; he had heard that there were also Water Spirits and Fire Spirits.</p><p>This Hanling was also a spirit born from heaven and earth, with low intelligence, driven by instinct.</p><p>But unlike the Earth Spirit Stone Apes in the Seven Kills Hall, Hanlings were gentle and not ferocious or bloodthirsty. Their instinct towards him was only fear, trembling in his hand.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the reason why the Earth Spirits in the Seven Kills Hall were so savage was likely due to the influence of the Seven Kills Hall's environment.</p><p>"The key to finding the Snowfox lies in the Hanlings."</p><p>Elder Yanshan explained, "The Snowfox emits an aura that Hanlings crave. Especially the Hanling leaders, with their keen senses, they will gather in the areas where the Snowfox frequently roams.  By finding the Hanling leaders, we can pinpoint the Snowfox's location. However, the snowy weather of the snow calamity is also favored by Hanlings. When the snowfall is at its heaviest, the Hanling leaders mostly emerge above the snow surface, frolicking in the snow. At that time, we can't use this method to determine its location. Now that the snowfall is lighter, the Hanling leaders aren't as interested and should have gathered near the Snowfox again..."</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood. "Fellow Daoist has put in a lot of effort."</p><p>He squeezed the Hanling in his hand. "This one isn't a Hanling leader, is it?"</p><p>Elder Yanshan hummed in agreement. "Hanlings come in all shapes and sizes. You can judge them by their foreheads. Hanling leaders all have a thin blue line on their foreheads. The longer the line, the higher their status."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and released the Hanling.</p><p>Secretly awakening the Sky-Eye Butterfly, he pushed his divine ability to its limits, gazing into the depths of the snowfield.</p><p>It was just as night fell.</p><p>Within the vast snowfield, the cold wind howled, and snowflakes danced wildly.</p><p>Amidst the swirling snow.</p><p>Illusory shadows, some leaping high, some hopping on the snow surface, some burrowing within the snow, were precisely the Hanlings, each with a unique form.</p><p>They danced with the snow, carefree and joyous, like spirits of the snowy night.</p>
