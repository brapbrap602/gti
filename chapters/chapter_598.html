“Brother Qin, look…”


Saying this, Yun Youzi took the bone flute and put it into the pouch at his waist.


Unexpectedly, as soon as it went in, the pouch glowed, and the flute jumped right back out.


Yun Youzi nodded. “Indeed. This object has a strange connection to the celestial constellations! However, I suspect this bone flute is incomplete.  All its parts must be gathered before its true nature can be revealed. Keep it well, Brother Qin. If you are fortunate enough to collect all the pieces, it won't disappoint you.”


Qin Sang was intrigued by Yun Youzi’s words, but he also understood that collecting fragments of such a treasure wouldn't be easy.  Some pieces might be destroyed, lost to time.


This made the treasure a distant dream, forever out of reach.


Besides, if he couldn't put it in his pouch, should he wear it like a necklace, like a leopard?


Qin Sang muttered to himself, trying, without much hope, to store the flute in his Qianjun Ring.


Unexpectedly, the flute stayed put inside the Qianjun Ring, without jumping out again.


“Hmm?”


Qin Sang was extremely surprised, raising his hand to examine it.


Earlier, Yi Tiannie had mentioned the iron plate named Qianjun Ring, whether it was a false name or the actual name, he didn’t know.


He had thought it was a common storage artifact, similar to a pouch, only larger. Now it seemed the Qianjun Ring was far more complex.


But no matter how Qin Sang examined it, the Qianjun Ring only had storage functions. He had to give up for now.


By this time, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi had flown out of the stone hall and reached the waterfall.


They were extremely cautious, ensuring there were no ambushes outside the waterfall before venturing out, as the demonic cultivators hadn't arrived yet.


“Demons are untamed and rarely harmonious, even those under the same demon king often fight.  The Shadow Leopard, heavily wounded, may not dare contact its kin; it would be like walking into a lion's den. But to be safe, we shouldn't leave the same way we came in. I know some smaller paths. We’ll take a detour to avoid them.”


Following Yun Youzi's instructions, Qin Sang walked on water, heading straight for the top of the waterfall. The Corpse Pill remained unsealed; he needed to break the restriction and leave the ancient medicinal garden as quickly as possible.


Along the way, Qin Sang recounted the information he obtained through soul searching to Yun Youzi.


He hesitated. “Senior, the San Guang Jade Liquid is hidden in an ancient ruin. According to Yi Tiannie's memories, there’s a remnant ancient spirit array outside that ruin, making it difficult to break through. Before my bracelet shattered, I couldn’t break through alone. I need your help, Senior.”


Qin Sang was worried they wouldn’t be able to break the array even together.


If that happened, he'd have to wait until he'd finished helping Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan, and see if he had a chance to escape.


If not, he’d have to wait for the next opening of the Ziwei Palace to obtain the San Guang Jade Liquid and cultivate the Jiu Huan Tianlan.


He could wait for the next opening, but he was afraid that unforeseen circumstances might arise.  He didn’t feel at ease without the treasure in his possession.


“Wait…”


Yun Youzi asked urgently, “You said the ruin is a large hall in ruins, with an ancient character. What does it look like?”


Qin Sang drew the character in the air.


The character was very ancient, but Yun Youzi recognized it instantly, exclaiming in surprise, “It’s the character ‘Gather’! Remember what I said about the origins of the San Guang Jade Liquid? This is probably the Gathering Spirit Hall, where the Gathering Spirit Bowl was kept.  I never expected that not only the Hanging Garden Palace but also the ruins of the Gathering Spirit Hall would still exist! No wonder the San Guang Jade Liquid still remains. If it's the Gathering Spirit Hall, Brother Qin, don’t worry; I know how to break the array!”


Qin Sang looked at Yun Youzi in astonishment.


Yun Youzi’s knowledge far surpassed his imagination.


His mastery of restrictions could explain his control over the demon king's blood restriction, but now, facing the ruins of an unfamiliar ancient site, he confidently declared a solution without even examining it.


It was beyond simply profound array knowledge.


“If I survive this, Brother Qin, I will give you an explanation,”


Yun Youzi said solemnly.


“Brother Qin, I have a request.


“Your Jiu Huan Tianlan is at its final transformation.  Five drops will be needed now for it to evolve, but if you wait until you reach the Golden Core later stage—at least two hundred years—three drops will suffice.


“If we obtain enough San Guang Jade Liquid, could you spare me three drops?


“I seek a desperate gamble for survival.  My chances of success are only ten percent, but with three drops of San Guang Jade Liquid, they'll increase to at least forty percent.


“For the sake of my life, I have to humble myself and ask you.”


The matter concerned Yun Youzi's life, so Qin Sang immediately turned serious.


He replied without hesitation, “Senior, you have helped me so much along the way.


These treasures, including the Three Lights Jade Liquid, would have been impossible for me to obtain without your help, Senior.  They should be considered our spoils of war. Even without your suggestion, I would have given them to you. Take as much as you need, Senior; your recovery and breakthrough are the priority. As for the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid, if there's Three Lights Jade Liquid, there will be Ten Lights, a Hundred Lights, a Thousand Lights. I refuse to believe that within the four hundred years of my life after forming my Golden Core, I can't find a solution!

Since the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid has already been revealed, Qin Sang directly stated, “When the time comes, if I need to refine the Transcendence Tribulation Pill, I will need your help, Senior.”

Simply consuming the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid is ineffective; it needs to be refined into the Transcendence Tribulation Pill.

But Qin Sang is completely unfamiliar with alchemy, and it will be difficult for him to cultivate alchemy in the future.

He had been pondering who to find for this task.

The Transcendence Tribulation Pill is so precious that it's hard to trust a stranger with it.

Yun Youzi comes from the Taiyi Alchemy Sect, and he demonstrated superb alchemic skills when refining the Profound Pattern Harmonious Rhyme Pill.  Having shared hardships and forged a deep friendship, he is the best choice.

Yun Youzi patted Qin Sang on the shoulder, silent for a moment, then said in a low voice, “I will never forget your kindness, my friend. Three drops are enough for me; more would be unnecessary. Rest assured, I will do my utmost when refining the pill! However, after the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid transforms into the Sky Phantasmal Orchid, refining the Transcendence Tribulation Pill becomes much more difficult. To ensure success, I may have to wait until after I form my Nascent Soul.”

Even with Yun Youzi's alchemic skills, he needs to wait until after forming his Nascent Soul before daring to attempt it, showcasing the difficulty of refining the Transcendence Tribulation Pill.

Qin Sang certainly cannot refine it himself.

He has great confidence in Yun Youzi's talent. After repairing his hidden injuries, he is certain to rise to prominence.  Barring any accidents, he will definitely form his Nascent Soul before Qin Sang.

“How many Transcendence Tribulation Pills can be refined from the Sky Phantasmal Orchid after the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid transforms?” Qin Sang curiously asked.

“Naturally, only one, and it will have the best efficacy,”

Yun Youzi proudly declared, “Rest assured, my friend, I have faced two major tribulations in my life. Besides those, everything else is insignificant. Forming my Nascent Soul is merely a simple task for me!”
