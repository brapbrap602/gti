<h1>Chapter 1333: The Fairyland Awakens</h1><p>After the initial shock, everyone remembered their mission and hastily searched for Ye Laomo.  But the inner palace of Ziwei Palace was in utter chaos.  Strange phenomena were everywhere.</p><p>“It couldn’t be Ye Laomo!  Ziwei Palace has been prematurely appearing more and more frequently in recent years, clearly a sign of some impending change.  It seems the truth will be revealed today. However, it likely won't be as we predicted—a complete opening of Ziwei Palace—but something far greater!”</p><p>Yu Wang, the most senior among them, had achieved fame long before Tongyou Mojun and Zhen Daochang. He gazed at the inner palace, observing this familiar yet alien celestial palace.  Yu Wang's lineage had been passed down for generations, each Yu Yao Wang being the undisputed ruler of Tian Yao Qiu.  Previously, entering Ziwei Palace's celestial array required the inherited treasures of the Yu Wang lineage, thus their consistent presence.</p><p>Among the cultivators present, no one likely knew more secrets than he did.  Even so, he couldn't help but marvel at the sheer number of secrets hidden within Ziwei Palace! Many places had been explored countless times, appearing unremarkable. Now, they knew this was merely an illusion—limited by their cultivation and knowledge, they had only seen the surface.</p><p>The current Ziwei Palace transcended everyone's understanding.  An unprecedented fairyland.  Incredibly powerful ancient prohibitions.  Alluring immortal medicines and ancient treasures…</p><p>Tian Shan, previously considered the core area, now seemed insignificant among the countless hidden realms.</p><p>“Ye Laomo has been plotting for centuries, choosing this moment to strike and unleashing an unknown demon. It seems he knew about this change in Ziwei Palace beforehand,” Zhen Daochang observed his surroundings.</p><p>Everyone's attention was clearly diverted from Ye Laomo. The transformation of Ziwei Palace was uncertain, whether good or ill. But for everyone, it was an unparalleled opportunity.  Take the ancient medicine garden as an example; previously, finding even a single immortal medicine was incredibly difficult, but now radiant light shone everywhere.  Anyone with the ability to withstand the garden's prohibitions could obtain treasures.</p><p>Zhen Daochang sighed inwardly, acknowledging his own desire.</p><p>Several top experts communicated through voice transmission.  Canghong Zhenren declared in a loud voice, “Finding Ye Laomo is like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Let's split up and act independently. If anyone discovers Ye Laomo's whereabouts, immediately signal the others. Do not let the rewards before you cloud your judgment.  Consider Ye Laomo’s actions; if we fail to eliminate this demon quickly, Northern Star Realm will never know peace!”</p><p>The cultivators were already eager to begin, responding with enthusiastic agreement and immediately flying into the inner palace.</p><p>Someone invited Qin Sang to join forces in searching for treasures. Qin Sang politely declined, spotting a gap in the clouds, and using his flight ability to pass through into the inner palace.</p><p>Ziwei Palace was filled with colorful auspicious clouds and celestial palaces, truly resembling a fairyland.  After scanning his surroundings and waiting for the others to leave, he discreetly landed on a fragment of land, avoiding notice. His corpse puppet bag flashed, and Bai flew out.</p><p>Seeing the strange phenomena in Ziwei Palace, Bai’s eyes flickered. After a moment of thought, he turned to Qin Sang and said, “Quickly go subdue the Nan Ming Li Fire.  Delay will bring change. I'll stay outside to wait for your senior sister and look around. I’ll send you a message if I find anything.”</p><p>Qin Sang had the same intention. The scene before him was entirely unexpected; no one could predict the eventual outcome of the changes in Ziwei Palace. What if this was a final blaze of glory before imminent destruction?  Missing this chance might mean there wouldn't be another.</p><p>Qin Sang was glad his years of hard work hadn't been wasted, refining his magical treasures. Although he only had less than a 50% chance of subduing the Nan Ming Li Fire, he was ready.</p><p>“Be careful, Brother Bai. I shouldn't take too long,” said Qin Sang.  Subduing the spirit fire was a matter of success or failure; one attempt would reveal the outcome.</p><p>He left the Demon Binding Rope with Bai, only taking his Nascent Soul puppet. This entry into Ziwei Palace felt completely different from the previous two times. Places that had been safe before now had hidden realms appearing, with layers of ancient prohibitions flickering in and out, filled with unknown dangers. No one dared to fly recklessly as before.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his ebony sword, transforming into a sword light, but upon reaching the edge of the inner palace, he prudently landed on the ground.  He gazed towards the direction of Jianhen Mountain, then scanned his surroundings, seeking a safe path.  Finally, he found a route where the strange phenomena were least prevalent, and without hesitation, he set off.</p><p>The closer Qin Sang got to Ziwei Palace's hidden realms, the more shocked he became. At this moment, he sincerely yearned for the splendor of the ancient cultivation world! The current cultivators were like frogs at the bottom of a well; without witnessing it firsthand, it was unimaginable that such magnificent sights existed. Even the ruined remnants of Ziwei Palace's hidden realms were unparalleled.</p><p>Qin Sang was fascinated by the unprecedented ancient prohibitions, though he couldn't understand them at all. This only increased his worry.</p><p>Jianhen Mountain was also clearly affected.  Previously, the illusionary array was dormant, allowing him and Yunyouzi to pass through it even at the Foundation Establishment stage and find the South Ming Li Fire's chamber.  With his current cultivation, he had little confidence in traversing the altered array.</p><p>The good news was that Jianhen Mountain's ancient sword energy had also erupted, seemingly disrupting the illusionary array.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang continued his rapid advance, soon approaching the Ancient Medicine Garden. He noticed that most cultivators were heading there, including Yu Wang and the Lu cultivator, even more than those going to Tianshan.  The Ancient Medicine Garden had undergone the most significant changes, with numerous exceptional spiritual herbs appearing, making their location easy to confirm. First come, first served—it was much simpler than searching for ancient treasures in other secret realms.</p><p>The Lu cultivator, busy tending to his frost lizard's injuries, wouldn't miss this opportunity; he was the one who had invited Qin Sang to join him.</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the Ancient Medicine Garden. He was certainly tempted.  Exceptional immortal herbs were unique; obtaining even one would be a great fortune, possessing unimaginable effects. Especially the Xuanpu Palace at the center of the garden.</p><p>Before his tribulation, Yunyouzi had detailed the origin and specifics of Xuanpu Palace for Qin Sang.  Knowing it could nurture the spiritual Qingfu Zheng Bamboo, it was clearly the heart of the Ancient Medicine Garden.</p><p>However, after careful consideration, Qin Sang decided the South Ming Li Fire was more important to him, and reluctantly turned his gaze away.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang arrived at a clearing.  There were no unusual phenomena; as he was about to cross it, he suddenly sensed something amiss, his expression subtly changing as he hastily stopped at the edge.</p><p>The next moment, a spring bubbled up in the center of the clearing. Water flowed continuously, quickly forming a small pond.  Qin Sang glanced around and realized the low-lying ground should have been a small lake that had dried up, now reviving before his eyes.</p><p>"The changes in the Ziwei Palace continue!" Qin Sang murmured, feeling a greater sense of urgency.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a crescent-shaped lake appeared before Qin Sang.  The surrounding scenery revived along with the lake; purple bamboo sprouted, growing into a bamboo forest at a visible speed. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves, creating a serene atmosphere.
