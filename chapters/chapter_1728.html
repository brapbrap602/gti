<h1>Chapter 1719: Breakthrough</h1><p>Years ago, Qin Sang and the Qinghu Saint King swore an oath at Ganlu Temple.</p><p>The oath was only valid until Qin Sang's ascension to the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>Before Qin Sang's breakthrough, the Qinghu Saint King couldn't bully the weaker, but once he reached the Divine Transformation stage, they would be equals, and the oath would be void.</p><p>Conversely, with Qin Sang's breakthrough, the restrictions on him naturally vanished, so he now acted without restraint against the several great demon saints.</p><p>In fact, even if Qin Sang hadn't broken through, there were still loopholes to exploit. The Qinghu Saint King's oath was a casual remark, he hadn't put much thought into it.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King claimed to have only enemies, no friends or family, and he wouldn't bat an eye if Qin Sang slaughtered all the Eastern Sea demons—it wasn't an empty boast.</p><p>Qin Sang captured the Zishen Great Saint and learned through interrogation that the Qinghu Saint King hadn't informed them about the Heavenly Dao Demon Sound.</p><p>These great demon kings had flocked to the Saint King's Palace, using the Saint King's power to enhance their own, seizing benefits; the Qinghu Saint King merely treated them as pawns, discarding them at will.</p><p>The sword formation sealed the heavens.</p><p>In an instant, the four great demon kings were trapped.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they found themselves in an unknown realm.</p><p>Bai Xiao Great Saint had witnessed the battle at the Wuxiang Immortal Gate and seen the Five Elements Divine Restriction, but back then, the restriction was on the verge of collapse, the sword formation was easily shaken, entirely unlike Qin Sang's current display.</p><p>He was both shocked and terrified. Looking around, he saw sword stars arrayed in the sky, a feeling of insignificance welling up within him, his courage failing him before the fight even began.</p><p>Two subordinates were by his side, but the Black Lion was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>This was another subtlety of the Seven Mansions Division Sword Formation—it could separate enemies into different mansions and attack them individually.  The Black Lion and Bai Xiao Great Saint were not united in purpose; facing imminent danger, they fled separately, unknowingly divided by the sword formation.</p><p>The Black Lion fell into the Kui Mansion.</p><p>The three demons were moved to the Shen Mansion.  Even without the array master's interference, rejoining would be difficult.</p><p>"Don't panic! He's controlling the array alone, there must be flaws. Find the main star, and we can break the formation…"</p><p>Bai Xiao Great Saint, surprisingly knowledgeable about the Seven Mansions Division Sword Formation, pointed out the key.</p><p>In truth, he had never obtained the secrets of the Seven Mansions Division Sword Formation.</p><p>After the Demon Suppression War, witnessing the strange phenomenon on Emperor Bestowal Mountain, the Qinghu Saint King and the Huiguang Saint had discussed the Five Elements Divine Restriction, and he happened to overhear a few comments.</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Restriction was the pinnacle achievement of the five sects of the Wuxiang Immortal Gate. The Seven Mansions Division Sword Formation, a top-tier sword formation of the Jinxiang sect, usually required multiple sword cultivators to achieve such a grand scale.</p><p>One person controlling the formation couldn't attend to everything.</p><p>Bai Xiao Great Saint's eyes were bloodshot as he secretly used secret techniques to search for flaws in the formation. But after looking around, he found that the number of stars was correct, their movements smooth; none of the stars in the seven mansions were dim.</p><p>Unable to find any flaws, Bai Xiao Great Saint's expression darkened, and he shouted.</p><p>"Protect me!"</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang didn't rush to deal with the three demons; he appeared in the Kui Mansion.</p><p>The Black Lion, alone in the Kui Mansion, unlike Bai Xiao Great Saint who had some understanding of the Seven Mansions Division Sword Formation, looked at the seemingly near and far sword stars, unsure how to proceed.</p><p>This demon was ferocious. A black light flashed from his body, his head transforming into a huge black lion's head, opening his bloody mouth, revealing his fangs, and letting out a furious roar.</p><p>A black orb shot out of his mouth. This wasn't his demon pill, but a strange treasure he had obtained long ago.</p><p>The orb spun rapidly, its interior a chaotic scene, showing a landscape of mountains of corpses and a sea of blood.</p><p>‘Puff!’</p><p>Black Lion Great Saint exhaled two streams of black air, which instantly merged into the orb. The illusory scene inside was swallowed by the black air. The orb trembled, and the black air condensed into a black blade within the orb.</p><p>The black blade was small and cute, but an extremely sharp blade aura emanated from the orb.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The inside of the orb suddenly emptied, becoming clear and transparent.</p><p>At the same time, a black blade appeared in the sky, its tip slightly curved, leaving a terrifying blade aura. Wherever it passed, the starlight dimmed, accompanied by the roar of a lion, it slashed towards the sword star!</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>Forced by the black blade, the sword star seemed to be about to be cut in two.</p><p>At that moment, the starlight in the void brightened, shining on the Kui Mansion. Instantly, meteors streaked across the sky, leaving trails of starlight. To Black Lion Great Saint, it seemed as if the heavens were spinning, causing dizziness.</p><p>These weren't meteors, but sword qi.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The sword qi arrived simultaneously.</p><p>A sword star, targeted by the Black Blade, blazed instantly, bright as the sun.</p><p>Black Lion stared, eyes wide, as he watched the Black Blade cut into the starlight, melting away at a visible speed, like snow dissolving into nothing.</p><p>Even as the starlight faded, the shock hadn't left Black Lion's eyes.  The attack was neutralized so effortlessly, without a ripple.</p><p>When the sword star returned to its original state, a Taoist priest stood above it.</p><p>Qin Sang materialized, hands behind his back, standing on the sword star.  He looked down at the Black Lion Saint, gave a satisfied nod, and said lightly, "This Daoist is in need of a mount..."</p><p>Before he finished speaking,</p><p>Black Lion Saint's eyes flickered, and he immediately knelt.</p><p>"I pledge my allegiance to the True Lord!"</p><p>Then, the Black Lion Saint rolled onto his side, transforming into a majestic black lion, head bowed low, prostrate at Qin Sang's feet.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, and without hesitation, formed a hand seal and directed it towards Black Lion Saint's forehead.</p><p>A flicker of resentment crossed Black Lion Saint's eyes, but he dared not resist, meekly allowing Qin Sang to set a restriction upon him. His body trembled slightly, and he bowed lower.</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>Bai Xiao Saint also revealed his true form.</p><p>A monstrous white shadow, humanoid in form, writhed in the starlight, surrounded by swirling white smoke. Countless demonic spirits materialized within the smoke, their forms contorted and eerily sinister.</p><p>He never begged for mercy.</p><p>Bai Xiao Saint knew that their deadly feud, forged long ago, was beyond reconciliation.</p><p>This man was the master behind the Dragon Whale, no wonder the Saint King Palace fell so swiftly.</p><p>A newly ascended Divine Transformation cultivator daring to attack the Saint King Palace meant he didn't fear even the Qinghu Saint King. Bai Xiao Saint's only option was escape.</p><p>He would break through the sword formation, rally his troops, and use their battle formation for a chance of survival.</p><p>The white shadow's eyes blazed with ferocity. He reached into the smoke, seized dozens of demonic spirits, and stuffed them into his mouth, devouring them relentlessly.</p><p>Amidst the howling wails of the ghosts, the demonic spirits in the white smoke involuntarily plunged into the shadow's body. With each spirit consumed, the shadow solidified, and the ferocity in his eyes intensified.</p><p>The two Great Demon Kings beside him exchanged glances, gritting their teeth. A white vapor rose from each of their heads, about to merge with the shadow, when they sensed something amiss.</p><p>Stars shone across the heavens, then countless stars suddenly shot towards them.</p><p>The sword stars moved, like the heavens collapsing.  An astonishing pressure washed over them, emanating from the sharp sword intent. Before the sword light even reached them, they felt as if they had been struck by hundreds, even thousands of swords.</p><p>The three demons froze.</p><p>The shadow let out a ferocious laugh, a bone blade materializing in his hand, ready to pounce, when he suddenly saw a dark shadow charging from the sword light. With a roar, a fierce gust of wind accompanied it as it lunged forward.</p><p>"This scoundrel has defected!"</p><p>Bai Xiao Saint was furious. Seeing Black Lion attack him mercilessly, using a killing move, his rage burned. The bone blade slashed a white line towards Black Lion's forehead.</p><p>The moment they clashed, he heard two screams behind him.</p><p>Two of his most capable subordinates were no match for a single strike of the sword formation, cut cleanly in two, instantly killed.</p><p>On a sword star,</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, eyes closed, his expression shifting between contemplation and enlightenment, as he meticulously studied something.</p><p>He had already trapped the three demons with the Seven Constellations Division Sword Formation; he needed no help. However, since Black Lion was eager to prove himself, he let him.</p><p>He left Black Lion and Bai Xiao to fight each other.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on comprehending the sword formation.</p><p>Unlike the Seven Souls Killing Formation and its techniques, using this new sword formation for the first time felt somewhat clumsy.</p><p>If his opponents weren’t Demon Saint-level, but cultivators of the same level, prolonged fighting would reveal its flaws. Of course, as Qin Sang’s understanding deepens, the formation's operation would become smoother, but he couldn't rush it.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't concerned with perfecting the formation, but with a new insight.</p><p>Before, Qin Sang had regarded the *Seven Constellations Division Sword Formation* as a common technique for Divine Transformation cultivators, mainly suitable for trapping enemies, group battles, and as a stepping stone before mastering the Cloud Touring Sword.</p><p>Only now, after using it, did he realize that this formation was not as simple as it seemed.  Its power was far greater, with other possibilities he hadn’t grasped yet.</p><p>The manual didn't explicitly state these further possibilities. It seemed that only after reaching a certain level of cultivation with the sword formation would one understand them. Qin Sang, able to control the array alone soon after using it, discovered them early on.</p><p>Qin Sang held onto that spark of inspiration, contemplating for a long time, finally shaking his head.</p><p>The same old saying held true—don't aim too high, first master the sword formation, then consider other possibilities.</p><p>However, it's clear that the Seven Mansions Star Division Sword Formation has great potential. Qin Sang couldn't help but feel excited, realizing he needed to devote more effort to his swordsmanship.</p><p>He looked up at the battlefield.  Seeing that Hei Shi and Bai Xiao were still evenly matched, he didn't want to waste time. With a casual wave of his hand, the stars of his sword fell.</p><p>...</p><p>The Bai Ming Mountain demon soldiers, led by several demon kings, were returning to their lair, unaware of the changes that had occurred.</p><p>A streak of light pursued them.</p><p>The light concealed a demonic bird, its speed like lightning. Even some transformed demon kings couldn't match it.</p><p>The demon soldiers parted to let it pass.</p><p>The bird flew to the center, stopping before a palanquin guarded by a throng of demons. It adjusted its feathers and respectfully said, "My lords, the rebels haven't pursued..."</p><p>After its report, there was no response from within the palanquin.</p><p>The bird's eyes widened in suspicion. It called out again, then boldly opened the palanquin, letting out a cry of shock.</p><p>It was empty!</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang, riding Hei Shi, was traversing the sea.</p><p>He had almost completely annihilated the demon kings allied with Bai Ming Mountain.</p><p>These demon kings had relied on the Qing Hu Saint King to run rampant in the East Sea, amassing wealth. Yet, due to the Saint King provoking powerful enemies, their millennia of cultivation were destroyed overnight.  Truly, fortune and misfortune are intertwined; the world is unpredictable.</p><p>"Master, we're nearing the Saint King's Palace,"</p><p>Hei Shi, moving effortlessly across the sea, reported, "Regardless of other sacred grounds, Master, please don't forget the Li Shui Ming Sha from Li Hanchuan. Observing your abundant vital energy and reforged body, I believe that after refining the Li Shui Ming Sha, it will greatly strengthen your physical form. This is beneficial not only to the demon race."</p><p>The Saint King's Palace had fallen too quickly; the Li Shui Ming Sha hadn't fully matured. Hei Shi was essentially offering a gift.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled something, and with a wave, he conjured several images before Hei Shi, "Have you ever seen these treasures?"</p><p>Hei Shi shook its head repeatedly, until it saw a strange object that looked like a tree but wasn't.  "Eh? I think I've seen this treasure among the Four-Winged Divine Steed clan.  However, it wasn't called Bai Chong Cao, but Bai Shui Coral."</p><p>Bai Chong Cao is a key ingredient in Qing Shuang Dan.  The differences in names between the Witch and Demon clans' heritages are normal.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and questioned Hei Shi further, the beast answering truthfully.</p><p>Gazing at the blue sea, Qin Sang pondered the aftermath of the demon civil war.  Before long, they arrived at the Saint King's Palace.  Long Jing Da Sheng had only used demon soldiers to surround the palace.  Upon Qin Sang's arrival, they entered together.</p><p>The Saint King's Palace wasn't extravagant.</p><p>For a demon king's palace, it seemed rather simple.</p><p>Walking through the palace, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable chill. Guided by Hei Shi, he went towards the Qing Hu Saint King's sleeping quarters, surprised to discover it wasn't a palace, but an inconspicuous small mountain, devoid of rare flowers and plants.</p><p>Hei Shi explained, "The Saint King ordered us to find this mountain on the mainland. I personally led the troops to move it here and planted vegetation according to her orders…"</p><p>The Qing Hu Saint King's residence was in the back mountain, a cave in a cold and damp ravine.</p><p>Inside, Qin Sang saw rough stone tables and benches, and a thin quilt. He could imagine the lonely sight of a fox wrapped in the thin quilt, huddled here.</p><p>Remembering the Qing Hu Saint King's account of her origins, Qin Sang muttered, "This must have been her cave on the mainland. I never imagined that ruthless fox had this side to her…"</p><p>Despite seizing the Qing Hu Saint King's lair, Qin Sang didn't feel much joy.</p><p>His gains were substantial.</p><p>The belongings and remains of the great saints and demon kings were invaluable treasures.</p><p>But one's perspective changes with cultivation. Before achieving the Transformation God stage, Qin Sang would have been ecstatic. Now, few treasures in this world caught his eye.</p><p>The same was true of the Saint King's Palace. The most valuable treasures had been taken by the Qing Hu Saint King, leaving only scraps behind.</p><p>As the mastermind who instigated the demon civil war to force the Qing Hu Saint King to appear, his plan had failed.</p><p>"Did she really leave?"</p><p>Qin Sang exited the cave, gazing at the sky, silent for a long time.</p><p>Long Jing Da Sheng approached to report.  He was the biggest winner of this war, his face beaming with joy.  He was about to speak when Qin Sang said,</p><p>"I will temporarily borrow the East Sea Eye to cultivate. The other treasures are useless to me.  You are to quickly gather the Li Shui Ming Sha, Bai Shui Coral… as my compensation."</p><p>Qin Sang listed several treasures beneficial to his cultivation, then turned and flew towards the center of the Saint King's Palace, where the entrance to the East Sea Eye was located.</p><p>Long Jing Da Sheng's expression shifted, a hint of pain on his face, but he could only comply.</p><p>...</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>The East Sea Eye was located in the deep sea, a scene of deep blue.</p><p>Qin Sang occupied this sacred place, undisturbed.</p><p>Long Jing Da Sheng initially worried that Qin Sang would stay there for a long time.  Seeing Qin Sang's lack of interest in the treasures produced by the Eye, he relaxed and used various methods to gather the items Qin Sang had requested from various clans.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stay long.</p><p>After his tribulation, his physical body had greatly improved.  During this time, he immersed himself in cultivating the *Heavenly Demon Refining Form*, and utilized spiritual pills and elixirs, along with the unique terrain of the East Sea Eye, to progress rapidly, soon breaking through to the mid-fourth stage.</p><p>He didn't continue his cultivation immediately but paused, flying out of the East Sea, departing without a word.</p><p>East Sea Islands.</p><p>Unseen by human cultivators, a Daoist riding a black lion emerged from the East Sea.</p><p>Soon, land was in sight.</p><p>(End of chapter)</p>
