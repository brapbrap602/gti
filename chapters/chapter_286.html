<h1>Chapter 279 | Remarkable Sword</h1><p>According to Qin Sang’s requirements, Cloud-wanderer chose Yu Kong from the three. </p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yu once entered Qiuhong Market and was able to leave safely from the defensive array. He is very familiar with the defensive array. This is an advantage that others do not have. The requirements set forth for everyone are not harsh. After entering the array, the Daoist leader is willing to continue cooperating. Of course, that would be a good thing. If he is unwilling, Fellow Daoist Yu will not force him. However, at the time of breaking the array, everyone must work together with one heart. No one can be selfish. What does the Daoist leader think of this?"</p><p>The shopkeeper said with some anticipation.</p><p>Hesitation appeared on Qin Sang's face. His gaze lingered on the shopkeeper as if he were undecided.</p><p>Seeing this, the shopkeeper gently slapped his thigh, stood up, and said, "Humble one has been presumptuous. The Daoist leader can have tea first. Humble one will not disturb the Daoist leader's雅兴."</p><p>Qin Sang quickly stood up and stopped the shopkeeper. "Fellow Daoist has misunderstood. Poor Daoist is not doubting Fellow Daoist, but has only heard that the defensive array of Qiuhong Market still has more than a year until its low point. It seems that there is no need to rush."</p><p>Invited earnestly by Qin Sang, the shopkeeper sat down again. "The longer the磨合, the more skilled the coordination, and the greater the probability of breaking the array. The Daoist leader must understand this principle. It is better to make plans early. By chance, there is an upper room in humble one's teahouse that is empty. Fellow Daoist can first stay in the small shop and make inquiries in the town to see if what humble one has said is true or false."</p><p>That night, Qin Sang stayed at the teahouse.</p><p>The second day, after leaving the teahouse, Qin Sang pretended to be taking a leisurely stroll in Western Waste Town. He vaguely felt that someone was spying on him, but he ignored it.</p><p>Qin Sang proactively asked at places recruiting people. Sometimes, he was politely refused. Sometimes, he received a warm invitation. Qin Sang did not agree to anything hastily.</p><p>For two days in a row, Qin Sang thoroughly investigated Western Waste Town. He had more than acted the part. He found the shopkeeper again and asked him to make an introduction.</p><p>The shopkeeper did not refuse and personally took Qin Sang to meet Yu Kong.</p><p>Yu Kong was rich and powerful. He had rented a cave府 in Western Waste Town. The cave府 was a small courtyard with two entries. Qin Sang followed the shopkeeper and met Yu Kong in the main hall.</p><p>Yu Kong was tall and thin with a feather fan and silk scarf. His temperament was calm. He was wearing a brocade robe, looking more like a scholar. From his appearance, his age seemed to be around 40.</p><p>More than 30 years ago, however, he was already a Foundation Establishment cultivator who had entered Qiuhong Market. His real age was definitely much greater than his appearance suggested.</p><p>Including Yu Kong, the three of them were all mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators. They had been hiding in Western Waste Town the entire time, gathering people and practicing the array.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang and the others just wanted to find the location of the secret passage through Yu Kong and the others and did not really want to kill and seize the treasure. Otherwise, their odds of success would be extremely low.</p><p>Of course, after finding the garden, they would have to rely on their own abilities when fighting for the spirit medicine.</p><p>When he saw Qin Sang enter the hall, Yu Kong stood up immediately and said in a pleased tone, "This is Daoist Leader Qingfeng, is it not? The old shopkeeper has mentioned the Daoist leader to a certain Yu many times. Meeting you today, it is clear that you have an extraordinary demeanor!"</p><p>The shopkeeper smiled and said, "See, how could humble one have lied to you?"</p><p>Qin Sang had already seen Yu Kong’s portrait. The gap in their cultivation was enough to make him behave respectfully.</p><p>"Poor Daoist Qingfeng, paying respects to Fellow Daoist Yu! Poor Daoist is new here and have nowhere to turn. Fortunately, the old shopkeeper introduced me. I have heard that Fellow Daoist Yu has a grand aspiration and is willing to lead scattered cultivators like us into Qiuhong Market. Although poor Daoist’s strength is meager, I am willing to be driven by Fellow Daoist Yu. I hope Fellow Daoist Yu will not reject me."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang's words were respectful and contained no hint of arrogance, Yu Kong nodded secretly and said with satisfaction, "Daoist Leader Qingfeng is being too modest. A certain Yu only visited Qiuhong Market once. I just know some things about the defensive array, so I dared to stand out and make a suggestion. At the time of breaking the array, it will take all of the Fellow Daoists working together sincerely to accomplish the task. How could it be reasonable to reject the Daoist leader?"</p><p>After a pleasant conversation, the matter was settled.</p><p>After the shopkeeper had taken his leave, Yu Kong took Qin Sang to the backyard. "Daoist Leader Qingfeng, follow me. The spiritual force in this courtyard is quite strong. The Daoist leader can find a room in this small courtyard to live in, cultivating while practicing the array. There are also a few Fellow Daoists that the Daoist leader needs to get to know. When we break the array, we need to cooperate closely."</p><p>As he said this, Yu Kong released his divine sense, touching the restrictions of the three rooms for a moment.</p><p>Not long after, the doors of the rooms were all pushed open by four people. They were all Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivators. There were tall ones and short ones with not much difference in their strength.</p><p>The two sisters who came out of the first room looked quite similar. Their temperaments, however, were completely different.</p><p>"These are the Xiu sisters. They are skilled with a combined swordplay called the Liubo Sword. It can be strong or gentle, transforming freely. Its power is extraordinary."</p><p>After Yu Kong introduced them to Qin Sang, he helped Qin Sang make introductions.</p><p>The Xiu sisters. One of them was charming and seductive. Her name was Xiu Zhirui. She looked at Qin Sang curiously. When she saw Qin Sang looking over at her, she covered her mouth and smiled, her beautiful eyes sending a flirtatious glance.</p><p>The other woman was more aloof. Her name was Xiu Zhiying. She glanced indifferently at Qin Sang and ignored him.</p><p>"This is fellow Daoist Shangguan Lifeng. His precious blade can slice through anything and has made him famous among the rogue cultivators here," said Yu Kong as he gestured toward a man who emerged from another house, carrying a long saber in his arms.</p><p>The saber was entirely black. The edge of its blade wasn't pointed at Qin Sang, but even still he could sense its unparalleled sharpness. It was clear that this was no ordinary magic weapon.</p><p>In town, it was common for cultivators to store their magic weapons inside their bodies or inside mustard seed pouches.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Shangguan Lifeng wasn't deliberately trying to mislead him. It was likely that he had mastered a high-level saber technique that required him to be in constant contact with his precious saber to reach the state where the saber and man became one, which would allow him to improve the power of his saber techniques.</p><p>"This one is..."</p><p>Just as Yu Kong was about to introduce the last person to Qin Sang, he was rudely interrupted by that last person.</p><p>"My name is Yan Wu, there's no alias about it, and I'm quite skilled when it comes to the way of talismans. I'm confident that I'm better than those old fogies at the Upper Pure Palace! Daoist Qingfeng, these seniors might have brought you here, but you still have to prove yourself worthy to the rest of us. Show us what you got, and don't come crawling to us for help later!"</p><p>This man was tall and muscular with a rugged appearance. He didn't mince words as he pointed a finger at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yan is a straight talker, and I ask that the Daoist please refrain from taking offense."</p><p>Yu Kong attempted to smooth things over, but he didn't actually try to stop Yan Wu. He looked expectantly at Qin Sang, as he was also waiting to witness his abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this, and he chuckled lightly as a beam of light suddenly flashed from the center of his brow.</p><p>――――</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A dazzling beam of sword light shot out, and the sword energy immediately expanded dozens of meters.</p><p>The sword seemed like a streak of lightning, and the faint sound of a dragon's roar could be heard from it. If not for the fact that there was a protective restriction over the courtyard, then it would have been sufficient to shock an entire half of West Wilderness Town.</p><p>Right after, and before several pairs of astounded eyes, the sword energy abruptly dispersed and then reassembled into a sword formation. The power of the sword formation ruthlessly pressed down upon them, with most of its power targeting Yan Wu.</p><p>'Bang, bang...'</p><p>Yan Wu was completely caught off guard, and he stumbled backward several steps.</p><p>"Is this power, along with my lifebound spiritual sword and this sword formation, sufficient enough?"</p><p>Chapter 279: A Stunning Sword</p><p>Yun Youzi, based on Qin Sang's conditions, selected Yu Kong as his target among the three.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Yu Kong once entered the Autumn Market and safely exited its guardian formation. He understands the formation very well, an advantage others lack.  His requirements aren't stringent. After entering the formation, if you wish to continue cooperating, that's excellent. If not, Fellow Daoist Yu Kong won't force you. Of course, during the formation breaking, working together wholeheartedly is essential. There can be no selfishness. What are your thoughts, Daoist?”</p><p>The teahouse owner said expectantly.</p><p>A look of hesitation appeared on Qin Sang’s face. His gaze shifted to the owner, seemingly indecisive.</p><p>Seeing this, the owner clapped his thigh and stood up. “It was my presumption.  Please enjoy your tea, Daoist. I won't disturb your leisure.”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly stood up and stopped the owner. “You misunderstand, fellow Daoist. I don't distrust you. I’ve just heard the Autumn Market's guardian formation won't reach its weakest point for over a year. It seems there’s no need to rush.”</p><p>Warmly invited by Qin Sang, the owner sat back down. “The longer the preparation, the more proficient the coordination, the higher the chance of breaking the formation. You understand this, Daoist. It's better to plan early. My teahouse happens to have a vacant upper room. You can stay here and inquire around town. You'll know if I'm telling the truth.”</p><p>That night, Qin Sang stayed at the teahouse.</p><p>The next day, after leaving the teahouse, Qin Sang pretended to stroll through West Waste Town. He vaguely sensed someone watching him, but he ignored it.</p><p>Whenever he encountered places recruiting help, he would proactively inquire. Sometimes he was politely refused, sometimes warmly invited. Qin Sang didn't rush to accept.</p><p>For two consecutive days, Qin Sang thoroughly investigated West Waste Town, putting on a good show. Then he found the owner again and asked him for an introduction.</p><p>The owner wasn't offended and personally took him to meet Yu Kong.</p><p>Yu Kong, wealthy and influential, rented a cave dwelling in West Waste Town. The dwelling was a small two-courtyard residence. Qin Sang followed the owner and met Yu Kong in the main hall.</p><p>Yu Kong was tall and thin, with a feather fan and silk scarf, possessing a calm demeanor. Dressed in brocade, he resembled a scholar more than a cultivator. He appeared to be around forty years old.</p><p>However, he had already been a Foundation Establishment cultivator thirty years ago and had entered the Autumn Market. His real age was certainly much older.</p><p>Including Yu Kong, all three were mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators. They had remained in West Waste Town, gathering people and practicing formations.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang and his companions only wanted to find the secret passage through Yu Kong and the others, not to kill and steal. Otherwise, their chances of success would be slim.</p><p>Of course, after finding the herb garden, the competition for the spiritual herbs would depend on their individual abilities.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang enter the hall, Yu Kong immediately stood up and spoke with a joyful tone, “This must be Daoist Qing Feng! The old owner has mentioned you many times.  Seeing you today, you truly possess an extraordinary presence!”</p><p>The owner smiled. “See? Have I ever lied to you?”</p><p>Qin Sang had already seen Yu Kong's portrait, and the difference in their cultivation levels was enough for him to adopt a respectful attitude.</p><p>“I am Qing Feng. Greetings, Fellow Daoist Yu! I've recently arrived and have nowhere to turn.  Fortunately, the old owner recommended me.  I’ve heard of your righteous heart, Fellow Daoist Yu, willing to lead us casual cultivators into the Autumn Market. Though my strength is meager, I’m willing to be at your command. I hope you won't find me unworthy.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's respectful words and lack of arrogance, Yu Kong nodded inwardly, smiling with satisfaction. “Daoist Qing Feng, you are too modest. I’ve merely been to the Autumn Market once and have some understanding of the guardian formation. That's why I dared to take the initiative. Breaking the formation requires all fellow Daoists to work together. How could I possibly reject you?”</p><p>After some pleasantries, the matter was settled.</p><p>After the owner left, Yu Kong led Qin Sang to the back courtyard. “Follow me, Daoist Qing Feng. The spiritual energy in this courtyard is relatively rich. You can find a room here, cultivate, and practice formations. There are also a few other fellow Daoists you should meet. Close cooperation is necessary for breaking the formation.”</p><p>As he spoke, Yu Kong released his divine sense, touching the restrictions on three rooms.</p><p>Soon, the doors of the rooms were pushed open, and four people emerged. All were early Foundation Establishment cultivators, of varying heights, but generally similar in strength.</p><p>Two sisters emerged from the first room, quite similar in appearance, but with drastically different temperaments.</p><p>“These are the Xiu sisters. They are skilled in a cooperative sword technique, the Flowing Wave Sword, which can be both firm and gentle, adaptable and powerful.”</p><p>After introducing Qin Sang to them, Yu Kong introduced them to Qin Sang.</p><p>Of the Xiu sisters, one was alluring and named Xiu Zhirui. She curiously examined Qin Sang, and seeing him look back, she covered her mouth with a smile, her almond-shaped eyes shimmering.</p><p>Another one was rather aloof, named Xiu Zhiying. She glanced at Qin Sang indifferently and then ignored him.</p><p>"This is Fellow Daoist Shangguan Lifeng. His treasured saber can cut through anything. He's quite renowned among the local itinerant cultivators," Yu Kong said, pointing to a man with a long saber in his arms who emerged from the second room.</p><p>The saber was entirely black. Although its edge wasn't facing Qin Sang, he could still sense its extreme sharpness. It was clearly no ordinary magical tool.</p><p>Within the town, magical tools could be stored inside one's body or a storage pouch.</p><p>However, Qin Sang knew that Shangguan Lifeng wasn't just putting on an act. He likely practiced a profound saber technique that required constant contact with his treasured saber to achieve a state of unity between man and blade, further enhancing his saber skills.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>Yu Kong was about to introduce the last person to Qin Sang when he was suddenly interrupted.</p><p>"I am Yan Wu, a practitioner of the Talisman Dao, and I dare say my skills are no less than those old fogies from the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace! Daoist Qingshan, even if Elder Yu Kong brought you, you still have to pass our test. Show us what you're capable of.  Don't drag us down later."</p><p>This man was a tall, powerfully built man with a rough appearance. He pointed at Qin Sang unceremoniously, his words blunt and unsparing.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yan is a straightforward man. Please don't take offense, Daoist..."</p><p>Yu Kong tried to smooth things over, but he didn't stop Yan Wu.  He looked at Qin Sang, also waiting for him to demonstrate his abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this. He chuckled, and suddenly a light flashed between his eyebrows.</p><p>――――</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A dazzling sword beam shot out, its energy instantly expanding several dozen meters.</p><p>The sword flashed like a startled swan, accompanied by a faint dragon's roar. If not for the restrictive formation above the courtyard, it would have likely alarmed half of West Wasteland Town.</p><p>Then, as several shocked gazes watched, the sword energy suddenly dispersed and reformed into a sword formation.  Its power pressed down without restraint, aimed mostly at Yan Wu.</p><p>*Stagger...*</p><p>Caught off guard, Yan Wu stumbled back a few steps.</p><p>"Is my natal flying sword, coupled with this formation, sufficient?"</p>
