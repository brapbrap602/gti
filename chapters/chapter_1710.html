<h1>Chapter 1701: Turning to Buddha</h1><p>Central Plains.</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang and Holy King Qinghu sat in meditation upon prayer mats.</p><p>Above their heads hung a yellow cloud, seemingly composed of swirling yellow sand, slowly rotating around them and casting their blurry silhouettes.  This was the method they used to project their consciousness into the Hundred Rivers Ruins.</p><p>Having heard Holy King Qinghu mention the Primordial Spirit Gathering Formation, Holy Sage Huiguang opened his eyes and looked over.</p><p>Sensing Huiguang's gaze, Qinghu playfully remarked, "You also desire the Primordial Spirit Gathering Formation? This formation holds a profound mystery, effective only for humans.  Its use by other races is detrimental.  If I give you the formation, and humanity flourishes in the future, launching expeditions to the Eastern Sea and annihilating the妖族(Demonic race), wouldn't I become a sinner of the Demonic race?"</p><p>Huiguang remained silent.</p><p>Judging by Qinghu's demeanor, she likely wouldn't care about the fate of the Eastern Sea Demonic race.</p><p>Unless her prior indifference was merely a facade.</p><p>"No need for pointless speculation, old monk. If this formation held such immense value, I would have already used it to coerce you."</p><p>Qinghu spoke frankly, her voice calm. "I discovered this formation before my breakthrough to Deity Transformation, in a secret realm named  Serene Void Isle in the Eastern Sea.  It was incomplete. I tried to modify the Primordial Spirit Gathering Formation to suit the Demonic race, but repeatedly failed. I can guarantee that no one in this realm can modify or restore this formation. Even if you were to copy it, your human race wouldn't be able to recreate the Spirit Gathering Formation. This is not merely due to a lack of the necessary heavenly materials and earthly treasures."</p><p>Qinghu's certainty stemmed from solid ground.</p><p>Huiguang was well aware of Qinghu's profound accomplishments in formation restrictions, her extensive knowledge not limited to Demonic race inheritance, as demonstrated in the Unending Palace.</p><p>During the Demon Subjugation War, the Floating Lake and Bright Moon, which trapped the demonic body, were grand magical powers created by Qinghu after mastering this Dao, their power evident to all.</p><p>"This formation possesses powerful effects unseen in other Spirit Gathering Formations. Besides gathering spiritual energy, it also purifies it.  It's a pity I haven't been able to fully comprehend its mysteries," Qinghu said with a sigh.</p><p>Current cultivators struggled to understand how such a unique Spirit Gathering Formation functioned.</p><p>However, this realm was filled with countless mysterious phenomena. Within the Immortal Halls existed things even more peculiar, completely beyond their imagination and comprehension, remaining unsolved enigmas.</p><p>"After being tampered with by me, and further damaged, this Primordial Spirit Gathering Formation will gradually self-destruct during use. Of course, it's more than enough for one person's cultivation." A hint of mockery suddenly appeared in Qinghu's smile. "Judging by his aura, he recently broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage, yet possesses such formidable combat prowess. Regardless of his cultivation level, it makes no difference. In this realm, besides you and me, he has few rivals. Once you and I journey eastward to the Returning Ruins, no one will be able to control him.  Wouldn't it be in your best interest to let him quickly break through to Deity Transformation?"</p><p>Huiguang lowered his eyes and remained silent.</p><p>Their conversation didn't affect the exchange within the Hundred Rivers Ruins.</p><p>After Qinghu's brief description, the avatar was already aware of the power of this Primordial Spirit Gathering Formation. To say he wasn't tempted would be a lie.</p><p>If Qinghu hadn't exaggerated, and the formation truly possessed such wondrous effects, it would significantly reduce his original body's cultivation time, leaving more room for the Deity Transformation breakthrough.</p><p>No one would complain about cultivating too quickly.</p><p>But the avatar didn't readily agree. "What else?"</p><p>"You desire treasures that can help you break through the Deity Transformation bottleneck, don't you?"</p><p>Qinghu saw through his thoughts, giving an ambiguous smile. "Such treasures are extremely rare in this realm. Even within renowned sects, the vast majority rely solely on their own talent to break through. Otherwise, wouldn't there be more than just a handful of Deity Transformation cultivators in this realm?  The old monk and I searched for hundreds of years in the Unending Palace, and only obtained a single Five Elements Pill. I do possess a Demonic race breakthrough secret technique, but it's unsuitable for humans. However, if you have any leads, I can help you obtain it."</p><p>Qinghu's every word and action exuded dominance.</p><p>She wanted to entice Huiguang to trade the treasures of Sweet Dew Zen Monastery for a deal with Qin Sang.</p><p>But such treasures were incredibly precious. Even with the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound looming, they couldn't be easily relinquished. Furthermore, Buddhist treasures required the cultivation of Buddhist Dharma, unsuitable for Qin Sang.</p><p>Who knew if the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound would inexplicably vanish, or if a solution could be luckily found?</p><p>Huiguang valued the Spirit Calming Incense formula so highly because he held a sliver of hope that the improved, superior Spirit Calming Incense might have unexpected effects, perhaps earning future generations a glimmer of survival.</p><p>Seeing this request yield no results, the avatar pressed further: "Does the Eastern Sea hold any clues to the whereabouts of the Ten Divine Woods?"</p><p>Since the Cloud Wanderer Sword housed Cloud Wanderer Zi's true spirit, Qin Sang hadn't integrated any spiritual wood into it for many years, fearing he would taint Zi's true spirit.</p><p>Because of this, during the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang focused more on his own cultivation, not expending much effort on gathering spiritual wood.</p><p>Fortunately, the Cloud Wanderer Sword had a strong foundation, having devoured the Unending Blood Mulberry and Soul Nourishing Wood, both among the Ten Divine Woods. Its material was far superior to ordinary magical treasures.</p><p>With the "Sacrificial Essence Technique," the nurturing process had accelerated considerably.</p><p>In the future, when the Cloud Wanderer Sword birthed its own spirit, it could continue devouring spiritual wood.  Gathering it in advance would save him trouble later.</p><p>"The Ten Divine Woods? Your appetite is quite large!"</p><p>Qinghu snorted coldly, impatience rising within her.</p><p>Unfortunately, circumstances dictated her actions. It was she who sought the trade.  She could only suppress her anger and say, "There were rumors of the Ten Divine Woods in the past, but such wondrous treasures, once they appear, are either taken in secret, unknown to others, or seized by powerful figures, refined into handy treasures, and carried away from this realm upon ascension. My palace does possess a Seventh-Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo, already in bloom. Although not comparable to the Ten Divine Woods, it is still a rare heavenly material and earthly treasure."</p><p>The avatar's expression flickered.</p><p>Seventh-Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo. He had seen this name in a certain ancient text.</p><p>He didn't fully understand the bamboo's power, but even if the Cloud Wanderer Sword couldn't use it, the entire Seventh-Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo could serve as a spiritual medium for cultivating the "Postnatal Wooden Golem Stele," likely surpassing the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree.</p><p>This way, he wouldn't have to choose between a spiritual wood body and an external avatar.</p><p>Before the avatar could respond, Qinghu proactively offered other treasures. "I observe your divine sense is exceptionally strong, unlike other cultivators of your level.  Are you a spirit cultivator, or do you cultivate a similar secret technique?  I heard you sought such treasures at the Treasure Exchange, trading Spirit Calming Incense for Near-Dragon Saliva. I also possess a few treasures that aid spirit cultivators. Of course, if you are confident in breaking through to Deity Transformation, I also have Deity Transformation realm human secret manuals..."</p><p>Qinghu then rapidly listed a few names, briefly introducing them.</p><p>Her attitude was proper, efficiently presenting a list for Qin Sang to choose from.</p><p>At this moment, Huiguang reminded them that the time limit for the secret technique was approaching, urging him to make a decision quickly.</p><p>Mo Xingdao silently observed all of this. From the moment he learned about the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound, his every action was no longer his own.</p><p>Watching the unsuspecting Qin Sang bargain with Qinghu, one could only wonder what thoughts ran through Mo Xingdao's mind.</p><p>However, at this time, none of the three could see the avatar's current expression.</p><p>Upon hearing Qinghu mention the power of one particular secret manual, the avatar fell completely silent, not uttering a single word. His eyes flickered, seemingly constantly deducing something.</p><p>Surprise, astonishment, and a hint of tension flickered across his face.</p><p>Reminded by Huiguang, the avatar composed himself, feigning casualness as he asked a few questions, nearly blurting out his agreement.</p><p>Of course, he still possessed some composure.</p><p>He had to return to Deer Wilds and discuss the risks and benefits of this trip with his original body, determining whether it was worth the gamble.</p><p>The avatar gathered his thoughts and continued his inquiries.</p><p>He had too many questions, and the opportunity to directly consult a Deity Transformation cultivator was rare and had to be seized.</p><p>The avatar's subsequent questions no longer revolved around the trade.</p><p>"Why did the ferocious beasts suddenly run rampant within the storm? To my knowledge, there were no ferocious beasts around the cultivation world before. They always resided in their lairs within the Returning Ruins.  Could it be that something happened within the Returning Ruins?"</p><p>Qin Sang had encountered Liu Li and naturally learned the secrets from her, including the name of the ascension grounds and its general direction.</p><p>The records of the Veiled Moon Convent stated that the guiding beacon was located in the Eastern Sea's Returning Ruins, a place teeming with ferocious beasts and fraught with danger, where even Deity Transformation cultivators dared not trespass.</p><p>For many years, the ferocious beasts seemed bound by some constraint, generally not leaving the Returning Ruins to wreak havoc. Qin Sang had journeyed through the Boundless Sea, the Demonic Sea, Central Continent, and the Northern Wastelands, yet never heard rumors of ferocious beast appearances.</p><p>Exceptions might exist, but such a dense gathering of ferocious beasts was definitely abnormal.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu was determined to obtain the Spirit Calming Incense formula.</p><p>A thought arose within the avatar: Could this be related?</p><p>"I am also curious about the ferocious beasts' rampage. I have dispatched my subordinates, along with the old monk's disciples, to patrol the outer edges of the storm belt, preparing to capture a ferocious beast and investigate the cause. If you are willing to participate, I'll reserve a spot for you during the hunt."</p><p>Qinghu unexpectedly tried to coax him into contributing to the beast hunt, not surprised that he had thought of this.</p><p>In fact, those aware of the connection between the Eastern Sea Returning Ruins and the guiding beacon were all speculating about changes within the Ruins.</p><p>But no one could have guessed that the anomaly wasn't within the Returning Ruins, but within the entire small thousand worlds!</p><p>It wasn't the path of ascension that was severed, but the path of Deity Transformation!</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang explained, "In the past, they were called ferocious beasts precisely because of their inherently bloodthirsty nature and low intelligence, driven by cruel instincts, posing one of the greatest dangers within the Returning Ruins."</p><p>So the ferocious beasts hadn't suddenly gone mad.</p><p>The avatar thought this was normal. With the terrifying strength of the ferocious beast race, if they possessed intelligence, the cultivation world would have long become their lair.</p><p>"During the beast hunt, I may send my external avatar to wave the banner for the Holy Sage. However, I hope any information the Holy Sage obtains from the ferocious beasts will be shared with me."</p><p>The avatar set a condition.</p><p>"Agreed!"</p><p>Huiguang consented. "Has Benefactor Qin agreed to the trade?"</p><p>"My avatar is acting independently and needs to discuss this with my original body. I will give the Holy Sage a reply as soon as possible."</p><p>With that, the talisman in Mo Xingdao's hand lost its glow.</p><p>Silence returned to the cave dwelling.</p><p>The two sand shadows melted like ice and snow, leaving behind Huiguang's words:</p><p>"Benefactor Mo, please return to Small Boundless Mountain."</p><p>...</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The talisman cracked.</p><p>The avatar emerged from his hiding place.</p><p>Moonlight bathed the land.</p><p>This location was far from the Hundred Rivers Ruins, its scene invisible from here. The avatar didn't even glance in the Ruins' direction, vanishing in a flash.</p><p>Then, the avatar traveled across the Northern Wastelands for a month.</p><p>He seemed aimless, as if sightseeing, rarely stopping.  Whether it was treacherous mountains and perilous waters, or regions ravaged by the Nine Calamities of the Northern Wastelands, nothing could hinder his steps.</p><p>During this wandering period, the avatar had communicated with his original body.</p><p>No physical contact was needed.</p><p>Separated by a distance, Qin Sang's original body, hidden within the Deer Wilds, imperceptibly received the avatar's experiences and the content of his exchange with the two Deity Transformation cultivators through their linked minds.</p><p>After the exchange, the avatar wasn't recalled.  He had already prepared for a prolonged stay away from home.</p><p>Learning the details, the original body within the cave dwelling stood up, his expression shifting uncertainly.</p><p>After all, being one and the same, the original body's contemplative expression mirrored the avatar's at that time.</p><p>It had to be said, the conditions offered by Huiguang and Qinghu were too tempting. To be free from threats and gain a period of peaceful cultivation was exactly what Qin Sang yearned for.</p><p>But he was even more aware that he had to be prepared to abandon this avatar.</p><p>The key was whether the benefits were substantial enough, worth taking the gamble.</p><p>...</p><p>Not long after the avatar's negotiations with the two Deity Transformation cultivators, the upper echelons of the Dao, Buddhist, and Demonic sects departed from the Ghostly Crag Plateau together.</p><p>Some personnel remained within the legacy ruins to continue exploration, but the three sects' focus clearly shifted elsewhere.</p><p>Subsequently, the upper echelons of the three sects made frequent moves, various signs indicating an impending major event. Those well-informed sensed the unusual activity and felt uneasy.</p><p>Surprisingly, the three sects' first action was to jointly clear someone's name, with Holy Sage Huiguang personally involved.</p><p>The Xie Family ancestor, Daoist Qingfeng!</p><p>Only then did the world realize that the rumors were true. In a moment of crisis, Daoist Qingfeng had saved the day, contributing the Demon Subjugation treasure that suppressed the demonic fiend and spared the world from devastation.</p><p>Even more enviable were the subsequent rewards.</p><p>The three regions, including Bo Prefecture, were gifted to the Xie Family, with the sects arranging for the withdrawal of existing powers within the prefectures.  In addition, various sects pledged their support, an ascent to prominence that could be described as meteoric.</p><p>Besides being revered as a guest of honor by the various sects, Daoist Qingfeng himself didn't seem to receive significant personal benefits. Only a few knew that the greatest reward, the Five Elements Pill, was taken by him.</p><p>With Daoist Qingfeng's current prestige, perhaps no one dared openly contest him for the Five Elements Pill.</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang fulfilled his promise.</p><p>Far away in the Northern Wastelands, Qin Sang was fully informed.</p><p>Three years later.</p><p>The welcoming bell of Sweet Dew Zen Monastery suddenly rang.</p><p>The bell resonated eighty-one times, clearly audible even as far as Flying Cloud Ferry.</p><p>Flying Cloud Ferry was abuzz.</p><p>This was the signal Sweet Dew Zen Monastery used to welcome the most esteemed guests.  The last time it rang was when Old Demon Lu, wielding the might of Deity Transformation, descended south in a small boat.</p><p>However, the various sects of the Central Plains had already received the news through various channels.</p><p>The mysterious Daoist Qingfeng finally appeared, visiting Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>Some inquisitive individuals from the sects even arrived at Sweet Dew Zen Monastery in advance, eager to witness the event.</p><p>The mountain temple was serene.</p><p>Yet today, it held an unusual liveliness.</p><p>A figure ascended the steps, composed and unhurried, captivating all who watched.</p><p>The bell rang eighty-one times.</p><p>The gates of Sweet Dew Zen Monastery swung open.</p><p>Grandmaster Xingji personally welcomed him.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of all, the two exchanged greetings.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar spoke clearly, "From a young age, this humble Daoist has admired Buddha. Although I entered the Daoist sect, I haven't forgotten my past aspirations.  I wish to reside within the Zen Monastery for a time, to contemplate Buddhist principles and seek pure and profound methods within this pure land.  Would the Holy Sage grant me this request?"</p><p>Grandmaster Xingji was slightly taken aback, then replied with joy, "Excellent! Excellent! The Buddha is compassionate, accommodating all beings, opening the doors of convenience.  Using wisdom and skillful means, he liberates all beings from the three realms of suffering."</p>
