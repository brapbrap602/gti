<h1>Chapter 937: The Vow</h1><p>If his opponent were only at the early Nascent Soul stage, with the Lightning Controlling Technique and other various methods, there might be a sliver of hope for survival in a special place like the Purple Mist Deadlands.</p><p>However, a top expert, second only to the Demon Lord and the Celestial Sect Master, was guarding the Demonic Flame. Qin Sang couldn't figure out how to escape under his watchful eye.</p><p>“He arrived after I left last time, which means he likely discovered the traces I left behind. This person is truly patient, waiting for decades like a hunter!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. He looked up. “He must be after the treasures within the Ghostlands.”</p><p>Bai scoffed. “What other reason could there be? Didn't you also think that there were ancient treasures hidden within the Demonic Prohibition? Over the years, countless cultivators have attempted to break through the Demonic Prohibition, but all have failed. Otherwise, I would have escaped this prison long ago. Who would have thought that this is just a dead land sealed by the Demonic Prohibition, filled only with lost souls and bones."</p><p>“You want to make a deal with me. Do you have a way to smuggle me out?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Indeed!” Seeing Qin Sang finally willing to discuss the matter, Bai eagerly said, “Not only will I get you out, but I also want to leave this place with you, so you can completely trust me."</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly taken aback. “You can leave the Ghostlands? Although my cultivation is low, I can still discern some things. This Demonic Prohibition is incredibly strange. If I'm not mistaken, the person who set it up around the Ghostlands intended to trap you here forever, preventing you from ever reincarnating. After possessing the Flying Night Devil’s body, are you no longer afraid of the Demonic Prohibition's seal? I could try to help you escape, but if you trigger the Demonic Prohibition’s power, we'll both be incinerated by the Demonic Flame."</p><p>Bai was silent for a moment, then said calmly, “It seems you have some skill in the Dao of Restrictions! However, the Demonic Prohibition’s power has weakened over time, so it's not surprising that you can see through it. Indeed, I haven't fully merged with this body. Even with your protection, I can't break free from the shackles. Therefore, I want to see the magic treasure you use to control the Demonic Flame…”</p><p>Bai paused.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, hesitated for a moment, then flicked his sleeve. Three small demonic banners spiraled out. Because he hadn't channeled his true essence, the Nine Nether Demonic Flame didn't appear.</p><p>“It's this treasure!" Bai's eyes lit up with excitement when he saw the banners. “The Demonic Flame is sealed within this treasure, right? The three demonic banners are linked and can form a great formation! The black rod you took out earlier is very similar to the banner poles. Are you planning to collect the Demonic Flame and refine more banners?”</p><p>Qin Sang paused. “You have a keen eye. Yes, I returned to the Ghostlands to refine this treasure…”</p><p>At this point, there was no need for concealment. Qin Sang briefly explained his plan to refine Soul Threads, collect the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, and reforge the demonic banners. Finally, a faint smile appeared on his face. “It seems the resentful souls in the Ghostlands might have been your acquaintances. You won't stop me from refining Soul Threads, will you?”</p><p>Bai didn't answer. His gaze was deep, as if looking through the ages, penetrating the river of time.</p><p>“I said before that it was because of an obsession that I have remained in this dark Ghostlands until now. Do you know what that obsession is?”</p><p>Without waiting for Qin Sang's reply, Bai said softly, “It's an obsession, and also a vow. My memories have all decayed. I’ve forgotten who I am. Only this vow remains, always remembered, never forgotten. It's my only remaining memory."</p><p>Bai looked back towards the depths of the Ghostlands. There, the ghostly mist was like a sea, and bones formed mountains. The resentful souls had lost their sentience, forgotten themselves, muddled and trapped by the Demonic Prohibition, forever unable to reincarnate.</p><p>“I want to break the Demonic Prohibition, allow them to be liberated, and send them into reincarnation!” Bai looked at Qin Sang, his gaze clear and resolute.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at him. The familiar Devil Corpse seemed to shine with an unparalleled brilliance. A vow that had lasted for countless years had sustained him until today, enduring loneliness and despair, waiting for an opportunity that might never come.</p><p>“Does reincarnation truly exist?” Qin Sang subconsciously asked a question that had puzzled him for a long time, glancing at the surrounding bone mountains. “Even if reincarnation exists, they have already lost their spirituality. How can they be reborn? If the Demonic Prohibition is broken, they’ll likely become lost souls wandering the world.”</p><p>Bai's face was filled with confusion. He shook his head with a wry smile. “I don't know! Perhaps, when I made this vow, I was only seeking peace of mind. I only know that there is a great formation in the Ghostlands that can guide lost souls, possibly left by me. Whether or not they can be guided depends on fate. This vow is the meaning of my persistence. Only by fulfilling it can I find myself!"</p><p>“So, you want to stop me from refining Soul Threads?” Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, flashing with a dangerous light.</p><p>Bai shook his head. “Don't misunderstand! I won't stop you because only by letting you refine the demonic banners can you help me fulfill my vow. However, the secret method of refining Soul Threads can be slightly modified. It's just a bit more complicated than before. There are countless souls here. You don't need to exterminate them all. Just extract a trace of soul energy from each soul. That’s more than enough for refining the treasure."</p><p>After hearing these words, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, his expression softening slightly. He nodded. “Your suggestion seems feasible, although it adds more trouble. However, if you can help me restrain the souls and order them to obediently let me extract their soul energy, the speed shouldn't be much slower."</p><p>Bai was overjoyed. “I will certainly assist with all my might!”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him and chuckled. “Don't get too excited. We haven't talked about the main point yet. What exactly do you want me to do? What are the terms of the deal?”</p><p>“What you need to do is simple. Over time, several weaknesses have appeared in the Demonic Prohibition. I hope that when you collect the Demonic Flame, you start at specific locations, thereby weakening the Demonic Prohibition’s power.”</p><p>Bai quickly explained, “Then, I will activate the great formation and forcefully attack the Demonic Prohibition, guiding the lost souls. Once the Demonic Prohibition is broken, the ghostly mist accumulated here will erupt. The combined force will be astonishing, and the person outside will be hit by the powerful aftershock. Caught off guard, he will be in disarray, and we can seize the opportunity to escape…”</p><p>Bai then explained his plan in detail to Qin Sang.</p><p>“So, the Demonic Flame isn't just blocking the valley entrance, but spread throughout the entire Demonic Prohibition. In this way, I can quietly refine the eighteen demonic banners."  Qin Sang looked thoughtful.</p><p>He had been worried that the commotion caused by collecting the Nine Nether Demonic Flame couldn't be concealed and would alert the enemy outside.</p>
