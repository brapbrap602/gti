<h1>Chapter 1605:  Understanding the Path</h1><p>Chapter 1605:  Understanding the Path</p><p>The Ghost Mother was furious.</p><p>Qin Sang looked sheepish.</p><p>Ever since the Fat Silkworm was caught, Qin Sang had tried feeding it various spirit medicines. Only “poisons” seemed to improve its condition, leading Qin Sang to believe it was a venomous insect.</p><p>In fact, the Fat Silkworm's abilities had always been related to detoxification. After its fourth transformation, the newly formed pearl could only absorb poisons, with no other changes.</p><p>He remembered catching the Fat Silkworm in a poisonous swamp, originally intending to trap a colorful ringed giant earthworm.</p><p>Later, the Fat Silkworm swallowed a Thousand-Handed Spider fruit, undergoing a transformation and awakening its detoxification aura, leading to its current state. It was probably related to its growth environment; it was simply its own fault for developing this way.</p><p>"Luckily, it's only in the early stages of its fourth transformation, just beginning its path, so it can still be corrected. Otherwise, if you continue to raise it like this, you'd be wasting such good bloodline!"</p><p>The Ghost Mother stared at the Fat Silkworm, lost in thought.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm curled up, trembling, looking at Qin Sang with pitiful eyes, begging for help.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored it.</p><p>Two words from the Ghost Mother caught his attention.</p><p>"Entering the Path?"</p><p>"You don't know?"</p><p>The Ghost Mother, still considering the Fat Silkworm's situation, responded with a casual "Oh," explaining, "The inheritance in this realm is incomplete… Cultivators, especially human cultivators, draw upon primordial essence to establish their foundation, then through the union of yin and yang, refine their essence into a golden core, forging a trace of true nature—this is the basis for achieving the path. The Nascent Soul stage is the beginning of entering the path. I observe that most cultivators in this world are Spirit Cultivators, entering the path through Qi. Of course, our choices are far broader than those of spirit insects; there will be more opportunities later.  A spirit insect's path is more pure than ours, a fixed course with no regrets, unless it obtains a transformative opportunity, it's difficult to change.”</p><p>"Entering the path through Qi?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then continued to ask, "Spirit Cultivation? Body Cultivation? What about those?"</p><p>"Spirit Cultivators enter the path through their spiritual soul, Body Cultivators refine their primordial essence; most Demon Cultivators take this route… though most eventually converge on the same path.  To reach the Unity Realm in the future, one must achieve the perfect harmony of essence, Qi, and spirit to have a chance at unifying with the Dao.”</p><p>The Ghost Mother didn't realize the extent of the shock her words had on Qin Sang, essentially illuminating his path, pointing directly to the Unity Dao!</p><p>Bai had mentioned these things before, but his memories were fragmented, leaving him unable to explain them clearly. He only told Qin Sang to persist in the cultivation of essence, Qi, and spirit, emphasizing its future benefits.</p><p>"Are the Nascent Soul, Transformation, and Void stages the process of unifying with the Dao?"</p><p>Qin Sang, hearing about the Unity Realm for the first time and combining it with his previous thoughts, finally understood.</p><p>No wonder hunting the Corpse King didn't yield a Nascent Soul, but a Corpse Soul Pearl.  Demon Cultivators, after transforming, similarly don't have a Nascent Soul, but continue to refine their demon pill.</p><p>Because they are all condensations of primordial essence!</p><p>The Ghost Mother didn't notice Qin Sang's unusual reaction, continuing without interruption, "Exactly!  To be precise, it's a path explored by human Spirit Cultivators: refining essence into Qi, entering the path through Qi, then using this as a basis to refine Qi into spirit, spirit into void, and finally unifying with the Dao, but it's not applicable to everyone. The paths of Spirit Cultivators and Body Cultivators are not entirely the same as those of Spirit Cultivators; even within Spirit Cultivation, there are thousands of differences. The names of the stages shouldn't be the same, but since Spirit Cultivators currently dominate, the names Nascent Soul, Transformation, and Void Realm have become mainstream."</p><p>"How do Ghost Cultivators unify with the Dao?" Qin Sang still didn't fully understand and quickly asked again.</p><p>Ghost Cultivators only have a soul body.</p><p>The Ghost Mother looked at him strangely, "After Ghost Cultivators achieve the Nascent Soul stage, some condense a physical body, others cultivate a new physical body… When I said 'most,' it's because this path to unification is the most common; most cultivation techniques and supernatural powers can be forcibly categorized under it.  The other part comprises special cases—plenty exist throughout the cultivation world. There are pure Body Cultivators, and Ghost Cultivators who stick to one path, and they may still have the potential for unification. There are even many paths you've never heard of, without cultivating the self, yet capable of achieving powers comparable to the Unity Realm! In this vast world, there are wonders beyond imagination, far more diverse than you think. Being confined to this realm limits your perspective…"</p><p>"Could the opportunity to break through to the Transformation stage lie in the spiritual soul?" Qin Sang mused.</p><p>This meant that by forcefully cultivating the Fire Seed Golden Lotus, attempting to make his spiritual sense break through first, he had unintentionally taken the right path.</p><p>The Ghost Mother countered, "Not quite, it's not that simple. Breakthroughs to different realms represent a closer approximation to the Heavenly Dao, an overall elevation of oneself.  Without understanding the principles, even with a strong spiritual sense, you merely have powerful abilities—don't forget you entered the path through Qi, your primordial essence is the foundation… Of course, a powerful spiritual soul is undoubtedly beneficial for comprehending the Dao."</p><p>Qin Sang respectfully asked, "Please advise me, senior, what should I do?"</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>The Ghost Mother shook her head frankly.</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>She understood the Unity Realm, but not the Transformation stage?</p><p>The Ghost Mother shifted her gaze from the Fat Silkworm, glanced at Ya Gu, and looked at Qin Sang, saying, "However, I can point you to a place where you might find Transformation stage relics. How much you gain depends on your luck."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang calmed down from the initial surprise.</p><p>Heaven wouldn't just drop a pie from the sky.</p><p>The Ghost Mother hadn't been giving him all this guidance for nothing; she had ulterior motives!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious. He looked at Fei Can and then at Ya Gu, and said gravely, "Senior, what do you want from me?"</p><p>"To cultivate to the late Yuan Ying stage in this realm, you're certainly perceptive.  It saves me a lot of trouble," the Ghost Mother placed Fei Can on Ya Gu, then leaned down to examine her closely. "She's been well-protected by you. It will take some effort, but there's a good chance of awakening her. Once she's recovered, I'll take her away."</p><p>Qin Sang had thought the Ghost Mother was after Fei Can, but it turned out she wanted to take Ya Gu as well.</p><p>Taking her as a disciple?</p><p>Or something else entirely?</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Ghost Mother.</p><p>The Ghost Mother said curiously, "You're not attached to her, are you?  Since she's not your beloved, have you considered how she will manage on her own after she wakes up?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily speechless.</p><p>When Ya Gu first fell into a deep sleep, his intentions were simple: to wake her up, then find a safe and prosperous place for her to settle down, allowing her to live a peaceful life.</p><p>If he failed, he would bury Ya Gu.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome, he would do his best and stay true to his heart.</p><p>Little did he know, Ya Gu's sleep would last five hundred years.</p><p>Five hundred years. Qin Sang had grown accustomed to her presence. His determination to awaken her had become a habit.</p><p>From the Canglang Sea to the Beichen Realm, then to the three northern realms, and finally to the Central Plains, hope after hope had turned to disappointment. Now, Qin Sang only sought to awaken her, unable to consider anything else.</p><p>"I sense your ambition. You're certainly not content to stop at the Yuan Ying stage. The path to immortality is arduous; you can't keep her with you forever. How will you manage? Her life-bound insect Gu has advanced to its fourth stage. After awakening, her cultivation will be much easier, but it won't be overnight. For her to catch up to you would be a fool's dream!"</p><p>The Ghost Mother pointed at herself.  "I can guide her. Do you understand the Dao of the Witch Clan?"</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly, "Senior, you intend to take her as your disciple?"</p><p>He didn't believe she was simply seeking a successor.</p><p>Unless she was at the end of her life, she definitely had ulterior motives regarding Ya Gu!</p><p>The Ghost Mother knew she couldn't hide it from Qin Sang, so she laid everything out.</p><p>"After I awakened, I was trapped in a formation beneath the Jinghai Sect. When I escaped, I was nearly depleted, reduced to a mere soul. In the three northern realms, I failed to find any of my kin, so I simply refined a new body."</p><p>Refined, or possessed?</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze turned cold.</p><p>The Ghost Mother seemed not to notice Qin Sang's expression, continuing, "Having partially recovered my strength, I passed through the storm belt to the Beichen Realm. My purpose in the Beichen Realm was twofold: to find my kin and to find the Demon Clan's altar!"</p><p>The Demon Clan's altar?</p><p>Could it be an Ascension Platform?</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, but he remained outwardly calm, not interrupting the Ghost Mother.</p><p>"You already know what happened afterward. I was targeted by a sword-madman, trapped in the Abyssal Ruins, then rescued by Tan Hao. I returned to the three northern realms, used a previously laid plan to restore my cultivation, and came to the Central Plains."</p><p>"Was Master Tianyue already a Nascent Divinity cultivator back then?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>The Ghost Mother's displayed power was formidable, and it was unknown how many hidden methods she possessed. She was undoubtedly among the top tier of Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>To defeat the Ghost Mother and even imprison her, nearly causing her death, only a Nascent Divinity cultivator could have achieved this.</p><p>The Ghost Mother was furious. "That little brat Tianyue was stubborn and wouldn't heed my advice. While I was still recovering, he used underhanded methods – an unfair victory!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes showed a strange expression. He silently thought that if the Ghost Mother had been as sarcastic toward Tianyue as she was now, getting a beating would have been deserved.</p><p>"I won't deny that he is a top-tier figure in the world. Without a doubt, he has already reached the Nascent Divinity stage."</p><p>The Ghost Mother didn't belittle Master Tianyue despite their enmity, continuing her story. "The Central Plains is vast, but there is no place for my clan. I learned that there was a foreign land, the Western Lands, to the west of the Central Plains.  The Western Lands have a harsh environment and its people are impoverished. They revere Buddhism and Taoism, but I still found no trace of my clan's heritage. However, after searching the Western Lands for many years, I finally found a clue...a Witch Clan cultivator at the Nascent Divinity stage had been to the Western Lands!"</p><p>The Ghost Mother stared at Qin Sang, suspecting Ya Gu and the Witch Clan's Nascent Divinity cultivator were from the same place.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>If the Witch Clan's Nascent Divinity cultivator came from the Canglang Sea, they must have existed before the rise of the Four Saints.</p><p>Since the rise of humanity, the Witch Clan had retreated to the Witch God Continent, gradually declining and never producing another Nascent Divinity cultivator. If the Demon Sea hadn't diverted human attention, easing the conflict between the two races, the Witch Clan would have suffered even more.</p><p>"I tracked the steps of the Witch Clan's Nascent Divinity cultivator and returned.  However, various signs indicate that this person may have ultimately perished in the Central Plains."</p><p>The Ghost Mother sighed, "The place I'm talking about is most likely where they fell."</p><p>Qin Sang pressed, "Senior, why do you travel the world, enduring such hardship, searching for your kin?"</p><p>The Ghost Mother calmly replied, "I must return."</p><p>"Return?" Qin Sang was taken aback. "Return where?"</p><p>"I don't know," the Ghost Mother shook her head. "Upon awakening, I had one clear thought:  return. The method is simple: find my descendants, create an altar, harness the power of our ancestral blood, and the other side will receive us.  Her body will serve as a raft, crossing the void!"</p><p>Yet, the Ghost Mother had fallen into the human realm.</p><p>The simplest solution had become the most difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened. "A body as a raft, traversing the void!  Is that how one ascends?"</p><p>"Ascension?" The Ghost Mother scoffed. "Ah, I forgot this small world's peculiarity; it's almost at its end!  Cultivators here find it extremely difficult to break free; calling it 'ascension' is somewhat apt."</p><p>"What do you mean, Senior? What is a small world?" Qin Sang asked repeatedly, feeling he was on the verge of uncovering the world's core secrets.</p><p>"There is a Greater World, where countless cultivators strive, a world of splendor and excitement.  The Greater World spawns countless smaller worlds; each may give birth to life, or be controlled, becoming a blessed land… I suspect this is a small world."</p><p>The Ghost Mother paused, gazing at the vast night sky, her eyes deep.  "The laws of a small world are incomplete. Depending on its development, the difficulty of cultivation varies. Upon reaching the peak of a small world, one perceives the world's marker. Following this, cultivators can pass through this gateway to the Greater World—what you call ascension."</p><p>*After achieving Divine Transformation, one knows where to return!*</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly recalled Xiao Xiangzi's proverb.</p><p>So that's it!</p><p>Divine Transformation is the limit of this world; only by achieving it can cultivators sense the gateway and 'ascend' to the Greater World!</p><p>Then, the Ghost Mother chuckled, "Of course, this is just my rough judgment. This world has many anomalies, surely the most unique of the small worlds, holding too many mysteries for me to unravel. If a gateway exists, it must be hidden deep within the storm zone, undergoing an unknown transformation, unreachable to us; even Divine Transformation cultivators would struggle to reach it."</p><p>"That's why Central Plains' Divine Transformation cultivators stay here for so long; perhaps the Eight Scenic Spots and the Ganlu Zen Monastery possess the safe path to the gateway, forcing other Divine Transformation cultivators to compromise…"</p><p>Qin Sang deduced further.</p><p>The strange occurrences in Central Plains, his previous questions, finally had answers.</p><p>But new questions arose. "Senior, you spent centuries searching for your kin; why not break through to Divine Transformation first, then pass through the gateway to the Greater World? Wouldn't that be easier to find them?"</p><p>The Ghost Mother, sleeping since ancient times, possessed unnatural longevity.</p><p>Her cultivation before her imprisonment must have been far beyond Divine Transformation.</p><p>The Demon Lord of the Seven Killing Palace is an example.</p><p>Therefore, she should recover her Divine Transformation cultivation much easier than these younger generations.</p><p>"Not for lack of trying, but I can't," The Ghost Mother shook her head, slightly puzzled.  "I've tried countless times, but the Divine Transformation bottleneck is incredibly strong, like iron, as if my path is cut short. I don't know if I've lost something, or… if I'm under an invisible seal. I must return, to find the answer."</p><p>Sealing an ancient cultivator at the Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't imagine such power.</p><p>He remembered the Jade Bone Demon Head on the Ascension Platform, impatient to recover his cultivation, eager to ascend; was he also sealed?</p><p>But why is the Demon Lord of the Seven Killing Palace different?</p><p>Too many things baffled Qin Sang. He ignored the secrets, urgently seeking answers. "Is the Demon Lord's Altar an Ascension Platform? I witnessed an ancient demon activating the Ascension Platform, opening a spatial passage, and leaving this world!"</p><p>"Oh? There are still surviving ancient demons in Beichen?"</p><p>The Ghost Mother nodded. "When I sought the Demon Altar, it was merely a backup plan. I wouldn't resort to that unless absolutely necessary."</p><p>She paused and asked Qin Sang, "The Greater World is not unique; if it's a Demon Altar, where do you think it leads?"</p>
