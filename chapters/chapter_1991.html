<h1>Chapter 1982: I Am, I Am Not</h1><p>“Mortal lands, Immortals and Demons, enter not!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was flat, his voice soft. Yet, these words seemed to contain boundless magical power, transmitting beyond the mountains, spreading across the mortal realm, from Cloud Metropolis Mountain all the way to Twilightfall Mountain.</p><p>All those with cultivation could hear.</p><p>Without any celestial phenomena, the words, heard by all beings, were no less potent than a clap of thunder. This thunder echoed in their hearts, bringing boundless terror, like a celestial law!</p><p>All cultivators felt their spirits tremble, an invisible pressure descending, weighing upon them, leaving them breathless.</p><p>Words imbued with Heavenly Decree, speech manifesting as law!</p><p>……</p><p>Yan Capital.</p><p>Chancellor's Residence.</p><p>Having experienced radiant light, dense dark clouds, and rumbling thunder, the ordinary people, unaware of the truth, were filled with fear.  They didn't know if their prayers had any effect.</p><p>Fortunately, the sky hadn't actually fallen.</p><p>Unable to hear Qin Sang’s voice, the commoners watched as the celestial phenomena gradually dissipated, the blue sky reappearing, the sun setting, and everything returning to normal.  They hesitated, wondering whether to venture outside.  However, the Chancellor had decreed that everyone remain within the residence.</p><p>‘Clip-clop, clip-clop…’</p><p>A fast horse arrived at the residence, delivering the Emperor's decree, throwing the Chancellor's residence into chaos. No one knew where the Chancellor had gone.</p><p>Inside the Imperial Palace.</p><p>The Emperor of Yan stood before his bedchamber, having witnessed the entire celestial spectacle.  He narrowed his eyes, gazing at the dusky sunset. “Has the Chancellor arrived?”</p><p>Yu Lang had departed hastily, unable to attend to everything.</p><p>The eunuch, still reeling from the shock, trembled upon hearing the question and stammered, “Your Majesty, the imperial decree should have just reached the Chancellor’s residence…”</p><p>The Emperor uttered a noncommittal “Hmm.”</p><p>Immortals frequently entered the mortal world, interfering in worldly disputes. The existence of cultivators was no longer a secret.</p><p>He glanced towards the east of the Imperial Palace, where Deer Park, the abode of Immortals, was located.</p><p>Such astonishing celestial phenomena, could they be man-made?</p><p>What terrifying power!</p><p>A shadow fell upon the Emperor's heart.  Could the entire Yan Kingdom be erased with a flip of someone's hand?</p><p>Little did he know that cultivators possessing such power were extremely rare. The cultivators of Deer Park were trembling at this moment, desperately wanting to know what had happened.</p><p>“General Qin is not at the residence.”</p><p>Someone whispered, “General Tao has also left the city, saying he’s going to pay respects to Immortal Yun.”</p><p>Tao Teng had received Yu Lang’s message and sought help from his master.</p><p>The two of them were closest to Immortal Yun, and Immortal Yun’s decrees were always conveyed to the Yan Kingdom's cultivation world through them.</p><p>The others were uncertain.  That decree forbidding entry into the mortal realm had terrified them, leaving them neither wanting to leave nor stay.  They all looked towards the tallest pavilion in Deer Park.</p><p>Standing atop the pavilion was the Nascent Soul Grand Ancestor stationed in the capital—the Kuang Clan Ancestor.</p><p>“Leave the city!”</p><p>The Kuang Clan Ancestor’s voice was heavy as he flew towards the outskirts of the city.  Having heard the decree, he was restless and dared not remain in the mortal world.</p><p>In an instant, Deer Park was deserted.</p><p>……</p><p>Yan’s former capital.</p><p>A quiet, elegant courtyard.</p><p>Within the courtyard stood an apricot tree, its branches lush and green even in late autumn. Hidden among its leaves were specks of yellow—ripe apricots.</p><p>Beneath the tree were a stone table and stools, and an old well.</p><p>A scholar closed his book and stood, observing the celestial phenomena.  Listening intently for a moment, his expression changed dramatically.  He glanced at the courtyard, revealing a hint of reluctance, and sighed softly.</p><p>“The sages often say: the greatest concealment is within the marketplace. I’m afraid I can no longer hide.”</p><p>He gently patted the tree trunk beside him.</p><p>The apricot tree swayed slightly, its apricots swinging like lanterns, emitting a sweet fragrance, as if possessing a spirit.</p><p>“You listened to me read, giving birth to your spirit. This is also fate. Come back to the mountains with me.”</p><p>He didn't know how strict this decree was, but he feared that if he left the apricot spirit here, it might be discovered and chopped up for firewood.</p><p>The scholar used a spell to move the apricot tree and reluctantly left the courtyard.</p><p>……</p><p>At the foot of the mountain.</p><p>There were only a few dozen families in the village, all of whom made their living by hunting.</p><p>The wealthiest family lived on the east side of the village.</p><p>The man's name was Wang Hanzi.  He wasn't a native of the village.  He had drifted here, and an old hunter, taking pity on him, had taken him home, fed him, and even betrothed his daughter to him.</p><p>Wang Hanzi was strong and powerful, always returning from the mountains with a full load, but he also ate a lot.  He only knew how to smile foolishly, never getting angry even when teased.  He seemed simple and thus earned the nickname “Hanzi,” meaning “simpleton.”</p><p>The celestial changes arrived.</p><p>Wang Hanzi, who was shoveling food into his mouth, suddenly dropped his bowl and rushed outside.</p><p>When the clouds dispersed and the thunder subsided, Wang Hanzi remained standing there like a pillar, motionless.</p><p>Beside him nestled a tiger-headed boy, frightened by the celestial changes, clinging tightly to Wang Hanzi’s thick leg, trembling as he asked, “Father, are we still going up the mountain today?”</p><p>Wang Hanzi exhaled softly, looked down at his son, then at his wife beside him.  She was far from being a natural beauty, yet she was incredibly gentle and dependent on him.  His expression was vastly different from before.</p><p>His wife and child noticed the change and stared at him blankly.</p><p>“Master told me to descend the mountain to overcome my tribulation of love.  I'm afraid I cannot comprehend it, nor can I ever comprehend it.”</p><p>Wang Hanzi stroked his son’s head, embraced his wife, and said softly, “Come with me back to the mountain.”</p><p>……</p><p>Immortal Yun stared fixedly towards Green Ram Temple.</p><p>He had sensed that the celestial changes originated from there.</p><p>“Daoist Qingfeng…”</p><p>The image of that detached and otherworldly figure surfaced in Immortal Yun’s mind, and he shuddered involuntarily, his back drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>He had actually intended to use Daoist Qingfeng as his pawn!</p><p>The decree arrived, jolting Immortal Yun awake.</p><p>There was no mistake. This voice definitely belonged to Daoist Qingfeng, but why was it coming from the east?</p><p>The east… could it be…?</p><p>Immortal Yun paled, leaving behind a message talisman, and hurried back to Cloud Metropolis Mountain.</p><p>Tao Teng, on his way to see his master, received his master’s message talisman, ordering him to immediately meet with Yu Lang. He was completely bewildered.</p><p>……</p><p>At the same time that Immortal Yun left, a streak of light flew from the Liu Kingdom, north of Yan, heading in the opposite direction.</p><p>The gray streak of light exuded a sinister aura.  It was the cloaked figure who had once played Go with Immortal Yun.</p><p>The cloaked figure had also detected the anomalies and was filled with terror. How could he dare to remain in the mortal world?</p><p>He anxiously watched Green Ram Temple until he flew far away without seeing any lightning strike down, feeling slightly relieved, but still not daring to linger.</p><p>The cloaked figure looked westward, towards his sect.</p><p>Even now, he hadn't received any decree from his sect. Could such a variable not be enough to alarm his master and bring him out of seclusion?</p><p>An inexplicable unease filled his heart.</p><p>……</p><p>Yuan Ding Kingdom.</p><p>There was a river in the kingdom called the Heavenly River.</p><p>The terrain of Yuan Ding Kingdom was higher in the west and lower in the east, with many steep and towering peaks inaccessible to mortals.  This river originated there, its waters seemingly descending from the heavens, hence its name.</p><p>However, more people called the Heavenly River the “Wicked River.”</p><p>This was because the Heavenly River was turbulent and prone to flooding, frequently bursting its banks and turning the surrounding lands into a watery wasteland, swallowing countless lives.</p><p>The river wasn't without a River God, but the River God was a wicked Flood Dragon that had attained enlightenment by connecting with the water veins, rather than through the accumulation of faith.</p><p>How could even the strongest levees withstand the impact of a River God?</p><p>Compared to faith, the Flood Dragon preferred to devour blood sacrifices, and every flood was a sign of its awakening to hunt.</p><p>Moreover, the more widespread the flood, the stronger the faith it received.</p><p>There was a village on the hillside by the riverbank.</p><p>The villagers were bowing their heads to the heavens.</p><p>Suddenly, a child pointed at the river and shouted, "Look! Look!"</p><p>The villagers looked up and witnessed a scene, following the celestial changes, that they would never forget for the rest of their lives.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The river churned violently, as if a legendary Flood Dragon was stirring the waters. Countless fish leaped out of the river.  The villagers seemed to sense the fishes’ terror and looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p>Then, they discovered that the river level was actually dropping, the stones along the banks gradually being exposed.</p><p>The rate of descent increased, eventually revealing the mud at the river bottom.</p><p>The village elder, only now, realized how deep the Heavenly River truly was.</p><p>“There!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>The river water flowed towards a single point, forming a whirlpool at the widest part of the former riverbed.</p><p>‘Gurgle…’</p><p>The river dried up, the riverbed exposed, revealing a bottomless, giant hole.</p><p>This hole swallowed all the river water. In reality, the wicked Flood Dragon had escaped into the underground water system, fleeing the mortal realm.</p><p>Suddenly, river water began to gush out of the hole again, gradually restoring the river's surface.</p><p>The villagers stared blankly at this scene, sensing an unprecedented calmness in the river.</p><p>Decades later, almost no one along the banks of the Heavenly River remembered the name “Wicked River.”</p><p>……</p><p>The Western Regions of the mortal realm.</p><p>The Yin Luo Kingdom bordered Twilightfall Mountain.</p><p>Demons and monsters frequently descended from the mountain to wreak havoc, making life unbearable for the people.</p><p>To counter Cloud Metropolis Heaven, a kingdom was established here, which ironically brought stability.</p><p>Outside the capital of Yin Luo Kingdom, there was a Western Mountain.</p><p>After the celestial changes, a yellow light suddenly emanated from Western Mountain, accompanied by the sounds of cracking rocks.</p><p>The main peak of Western Mountain trembled violently, sending boulders tumbling down.</p><p>It was as if a layer of its outer skin was being peeled away.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Giant stones detached from the mountain, but instead of falling to the ground, they joined together to form a stone pillar, extending outwards.  The pillar curved slightly, like a gigantic arm, complete with five fingers.</p><p>The two arms forcefully braced against the mountain peaks on either side, gradually lifting the mountain body.</p><p>As the earth trembled, a figure slowly stood up.  Its body was as large as a mountain, its edges and corners sharply defined, formed from piled-up rocks.  Its head was a square stone, and two cracks opened on the stone surface, revealing a pair of deep-set eyes.</p><p>It was the Mountain God of Western Mountain!</p><p>He looked eastward, then after a moment, grasped with both hands, and a primal yellow light erupted from his fingertips, covering Western Mountain.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The peaks of Western Mountain were uprooted.</p><p>The stone giant hoisted the entire mountain range onto his shoulders and sprinted towards Twilightfall Mountain.</p><p>With each step, he crossed several mountain ranges, his momentum astonishing, alarming countless living beings.</p><p>Birds and beasts leaped about in chaos.  Some demonic beasts and evil spirits also jumped onto the mountain range, taking advantage of the situation to escape into Twilightfall Mountain.</p><p>The stone giant paid them no heed, focused on his run.</p><p>Ahead, on the peak of a mountain, a human face materialized on a rock, watching the approaching stone giant, and asked in a muffled voice,</p><p>“Hey! The decree forbids Immortals and Demons.  You're not an evil god, what are you running for?”</p><p>The stone giant grunted in response, saying nothing, and stepped over the mountain in a single stride.</p><p>……</p><p>Ghost Gate Pass.</p><p>Yin-Yang Pass.</p><p>With this pass sealed, Yin and Yang were separated, and ghosts and gods did not interfere in mortal affairs.</p><p>Today, in various locations across the mortal realm, the Ghost Gate Passes opened, and countless ghosts and gods returned to the world of the living.</p><p>Chaos reigned in the mortal realm. Many City God Temples were no longer within the cities they governed.</p><p>Within a single kingdom, there were multiple City Gods, and sorting out their jurisdictions would take time.</p><p>The City Gods had anticipated this. Once the mortal realm was unified, there would only be one City God, who would still have to obey the commands of Cloud Metropolis Heaven or the Soulfall Abyss.</p><p>No one had expected such an unexpected turn of events.</p><p>The City Gods were all apprehensive, unsure whether this decree was beneficial or detrimental to them.</p><p>However, upon hearing the decree, the same figure appeared before their eyes.</p><p>A Daoist, clad in Daoist robes, ethereal as an Immortal.</p><p>Soon, the rulers of the mortal kingdoms all received dreams from multiple City Gods.</p><p>Upon awakening, the rulers immediately issued decrees, mobilizing the entire nation to erect statues of the Daoist in their capitals!</p><p>……</p><p>In the desert.</p><p>Qin Sang’s Dharma Body appeared at the edge of the thunder storm, his hands forming sword seals, fully controlling his sword.</p><p>The Gray Warbler Sword pierced through the storm, locating that aura, and mercilessly impaled it.</p><p>Even if Patriarch Ming Hu had survived under the protection of the Thunder Oath, he would be incredibly weak and unable to withstand the Gray Warbler Sword.</p><p>Just as he was about to obliterate all remaining traces of the aura, Qin Sang’s expression flickered, and he changed his sword seals.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Gray Warbler Sword flew back, carrying several objects within its light, including a dark golden skull.</p><p>The skull was covered in cracks—it was Patriarch Ming Hu’s skull.</p><p>On the brink of destruction, it had been snatched away by Qin Sang.</p><p>Originally, Patriarch Ming Hu could have used his skull to be reborn, but now he was completely obliterated.</p><p>Unsure of its use for the moment, Qin Sang stored it away along with the other remnants.</p><p>……</p><p>“No wonder the Daoist took the first move but chose white.  I have become the black stone.”</p><p>Gu Yun Sou looked at the white stone on the Tianyuan point of the Go board, a faint understanding dawning on him.</p><p>Because Cloud Metropolis Heaven and Soulfall Abyss were using the mortal realm as their Go board, the Daoist had been drawn here.</p><p>But why would such a supremely powerful individual show such concern for the mortal realm?  Could he be aiming to become a Sage?</p><p>A Sage?</p><p>Gu Yun Sou’s heart suddenly stirred.</p><p>He could be certain that the Daoist was not a cultivator of the Divine Dao.</p><p>There were rumors that the conflict between the Mahayana and Hinayana paths in the outside world was intensifying.  More and more cultivators were changing their ways, pursuing the Mahayana path, making demons and monsters increasingly cautious, fearing they might inadvertently become stepping stones for someone else’s enlightenment.</p><p>The Mahayana path not only encompassed the Divine Dao, but it was said to have branched out into several other paths, based on the Divine Dao, one of which was the Sage Dao.</p><p>The Sage Dao, to enlighten all beings!</p><p>……</p><p>Yan Capital.</p><p>As soon as people entered the city gates, they saw a colossal stone statue.</p><p>The area before the city gates had been cleared and transformed into a plaza, where the statue stood.</p><p>The statue, white as jade, depicted a Daoist—Daoist Qingfeng, the Master of Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang’s true body stood before the statue, murmuring four words.</p><p>“Mahayana Killing Dao.”</p><p>Qing Yuan had pointed out the Mahayana path to him, and Qin Sang had grasped some understanding.  This time, he had followed Yu Lang’s wish to protect all beings, using Patriarch Ming Hu and Gu Yun Sou for his enlightenment.</p><p>One must know whom to protect to know whom to kill.</p><p>Purple Star Sword Sovereign walked amidst mountains of corpses and seas of blood, his hands stained with blood, cultivating the Killing Dao.  He should have been a lone wolf, but he established a force, creating the Fourteen Sword Pavilions.</p><p>So that was it.</p><p>“But what does he protect?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked himself inwardly.</p><p>And himself?</p><p>He was devoted to the pursuit of immortality. Should he protect the world, willingly shoulder countless karmic ties and burdens, and become a Sage?</p><p>He felt a dissonance between himself and the *Purple Star Sword Canon*, greater than any before.</p><p>This was a dissonance of Dao!</p><p>This time, he used his disciple's heart to illuminate his own Dao.</p><p>What about next time?</p><p>He couldn't possibly take on a new disciple every time he sought enlightenment.</p><p>Furthermore, if it wasn't from his own heart, it wouldn't be the right path.</p><p>“Master?”</p><p>Yu Lang entered the plaza and saw Qin Sang in front of the statue.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body and the statue had different faces, but Yu Lang was certain it was his master.</p><p>Qin Sang turned, looked at his disciple, and said, “Qingfeng is me, yet I am not Qingfeng.”</p>
