Chapter 687: The Tail

Four years of demon hunting.
Qin Sang's cultivation had improved significantly.
After forming his Gold Core, he began to inscribe the fifth Killing Rune onto the Ebony Sword, which further accelerated his cultivation speed.
It was said that the Seven Killing Palace typically reopened every seventy to eighty years.  If nothing unexpected happened, he would have long since reached the mid-Gold Core stage before the next opening.
The forces preparing to break the formation would announce the news in advance.  At that time, cultivators wishing to enter the Seven Killing Palace would purchase entry qualifications according to the requirements.  The opportunity wouldn't wait.
Qin Sang would ask the瓊宇 Trading Company to keep an eye on this matter so he wouldn't miss the chance to enter the Seven Killing Palace.

Besides Qin Sang, the Sky Pupil Butterfly and the Fat Silkworm were also rapidly improving their cultivation.
Three years ago, the Sky Pupil Butterfly successfully transitioned to the late second metamorphosis stage. Now, it was only a hair's breadth away from the second transformation. Once it reached the peak of the second metamorphosis, Qin Sang would feed it Redfire Gilded Gold to help it break through.
The Fat Silkworm still had a small portion of the inner core in its belly, but its cultivation was not far from the mid-second metamorphosis stage. Qin Sang had tried giving it the demon cores obtained from hunting, but the Fat Silkworm remained uninterested.

It was now the fifth year since they left Island.
Qin Sang's supply of pills was almost exhausted, so he thought about returning to Island.
…
The sky was clear, and the sea breeze was gentle.
But on this stretch of water, waves would occasionally surge.
Amidst the towering waves, a faint green mist swirled. Within the mist, a figure holding a sword was confronting a strange demon beast.
This person was Qin Sang, and there was a faint seven-colored halo around him. The halo was subtle but still visible upon closer inspection, like a suit of seven-colored armor.
The demon beast he faced was called a Fanyu, a peak Spirit Severing stage demon beast.
Over the past four years, Qin Sang had encountered many bizarre demon beasts, and the Fanyu before him was one of them. It looked like a headless turtle, with a shell and a tail.  Its shell had whiskers, and its mouth and nose were on its underside.
Qin Sang had never even heard of this kind of demon beast in the Small Cold Region.

Its tail was the biggest threat. The Fanyu's tail was over ten feet long, segmented like a steel whip.  When it attacked, it could instantly lash out with a whip-like shadow several feet long.  Like a scorpion's tail, it was venomous.
The green mist was the poisonous fog released by the Fanyu, and its toxicity was extremely potent.
Cultivators encountering a Fanyu would most likely choose to avoid it.  Even Gold Core cultivators were reluctant to provoke this demon beast, fearing that they might accidentally get poisoned, which would have dire consequences.

Qin Sang had targeted this demon and moved freely within its poisonous fog because of the seven-colored armor. The seven-colored halo released by the Fat Silkworm could easily resist the Fanyu's poison.
Furthermore, to test the Fat Silkworm's ability, Qin Sang deliberately stayed in the poisonous fog for a while longer, and the Fat Silkworm didn't seem to be struggling.
It seemed that even if they encountered an early Nascent Soul stage Fanyu, the Fat Silkworm should be able to hold on for a while.
It was important to remember that the Fat Silkworm was only in the early second metamorphosis stage. Once it transitioned to the late second metamorphosis or even the third metamorphosis, resisting the poisonous fog would be extremely easy.

Generally speaking, demon beasts that specialized in poison had mediocre other abilities.  With the Fat Silkworm, their greatest reliance posed no threat to Qin Sang, leaving them at his mercy.
Qin Sang could specifically hunt down poisonous beasts in the future.
After circling within the poisonous fog a few times, Qin Sang slew the Fanyu with a single sword strike.  He pulled the demon corpse towards him and searched it, but found no inner core, a disappointed expression appearing on his face.
Skillfully butchering the demon corpse, Qin Sang enveloped himself in sword light and flew southwest.
Before long, Qin Sang landed on a deserted island.
The elderly couple and the other three were already waiting there. The killing intent on them hadn't subsided yet, and a faint smell of blood lingered. They had just experienced a battle.

"Senior, this is yours."
The old man respectfully handed over a few beast bones.
Qin Sang casually put them away.  While chasing the Fanyu, he had encountered a group of demons. He killed them, leaving the rest to the group to handle.
For the past few years, the five had been following Qin Sang, scavenging like this.
Their standards had become quite high, and they no longer looked at ordinary spiritual materials on demon corpses with much interest. Of course, their storage pouches were also full, leaving no space for more.

"Senior, are we returning to Island now?"
The Wang sisters stepped forward and asked crisply.
After years of interaction, they had become familiar with Qin Sang and knew he wasn't unapproachable. They were no longer as cautious as they were in the beginning.
However, they still carried out Qin Sang's orders without question. After witnessing Qin Sang single-handedly slay a Nascent Soul stage demon, their reverence for him grew even deeper.
"Why, don't you want to go back?"
Qin Sang glanced at their storage pouches and said with a smile, "Your storage pouches are full. If you continue hunting demons, what will you use to store them?"
"We can only replace the least valuable items."
The old man said with a pained expression, and then asked tentatively with some worry, "Senior, when do you plan to come out and hunt demons again?"
Seeing their expressions, Qin Sang knew what they were thinking. He said calmly, "Demons are becoming harder to find in this area, and it's too dangerous to go deep into the Floating Beard Sea. I've decided to change locations. After returning, I'll refine tools for the trading company for about six months at most.  If you have anything to do, take care of it quickly after you return, or I won't wait for you."
Seeing that Qin Sang would take them along again, the five were overjoyed and swore they wouldn't delay him.
Then, they all mounted their flying artifacts and headed towards Island.
They flew without speaking. Half a month later, as they approached Island, they rested on a small island.  After the five recovered their spiritual energy, they continued their journey.
Not long after leaving the small island, Qin Sang suddenly noticed a figure on the sea surface at the eastern edge of his vision.

Because of the distance, he could only vaguely see a dark shadow and couldn't discern the other party's cultivation level.
This person seemed to be heading directly west.
"Someone's there."
The old couple and the others noticed the figure, and the figure clearly saw them as well.
Both sides paused in unison.
Anyone who dared to travel alone in the Demon Sea must have had some reliance.
And since they weren't heading in the same direction, they would eventually pass each other.
"Let's go, don't mind him."
Qin Sang didn't want any trouble and said in a low voice. He then continued to urge his sword light, flying towards Island.
But the other party's next move made Qin Sang's face darken abruptly.
As they set off, the other party also started moving. However, instead of continuing westward, they suddenly changed direction and began to follow them from a distance.
Seeing this, the old couple and the others became somewhat panicked and asked in low voices, "Senior, what should we do?"
Someone openly tailing them was definitely up to no good.
Even if this person was confident in their strength, they were not far from Island.  The area around Island forbade cultivators from fighting amongst themselves.  Wasn't this person afraid of Island's patrol guards?
