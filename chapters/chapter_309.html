<h1>**Chapter 302: Driving Away the Tiger to Swallow the Wolf**</h1><p>Although the powerful fool's strength was great, his wit was not. He could only use brute force to resist the lightning. There was no way he could break through such a refined restriction. However, this was also why the Earthvein Yellow Spirit and other spiritual medicines were able to survive until now and were not swallowed by the bird.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer was interested in a spiritual medicine called Nine Splendor Blue Frost Grass.</p><p>Qin Sang harvested the Earthvein Yellow Spirit and put it into a jade box. When he went to look for the Nine Splendor Blue Frost Grass, he heard thunderous roars from the back mountain. He knew that it was Shangguan Lifeng who was picking the Blood Dripping Mushroom.</p><p>There were seven spiritual medicines: the Blood Dripping Mushroom, Nine Splendor Blue Frost Grass, Earthvein Yellow Spirit, Roiling Smoke Grass, Spirit Evergreen, Blue Dew Droplet, and Ice Spirit Fruit.</p><p>Their value varied, but they were not worlds apart. In ancient times, none of them were considered very precious spiritual medicines, far from being comparable to the Nine Fantasy Sky Orchid.</p><p>Moreover, their medicinal effects were not the same. Each had its own focus. For someone who needed it urgently, even the ones with slightly lower value were more important than others.</p><p>However, because they were guarded by restrictions, no one had ever picked them before. They had all reached a thousand years of age. In addition, they were extremely rare in the current cultivation world. Some had even disappeared, which was why they had become treasures that everyone fought for.</p><p>The Blood Dripping Mushroom was the most valuable of the seven spiritual medicines. Qin Sang, the Cloud Wanderer, and Ge Yuan all had clear targets. The White Robe Scholar did not dare to compete with Luo Xingnan.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled what the White Robe Scholar had said via sound transmission.</p><p>“This subordinate only needs that Ice Spirit Fruit.”</p><p>The value of the Ice Spirit Fruit was the lowest among the seven spiritual medicines. This person was not greedy at all.</p><p>The Nine Splendor Blue Frost Grass grew three long, sword-shaped green leaves, like three sharp swords. The leaves were covered with a layer of morning frost and surrounded by a faint moonlight, emitting a delicate fragrance of grass and trees.</p><p>Qin Sang did not know as much about spiritual medicines as the Cloud Wanderer and did not know what kind of spirit pills could be refined from Nine Splendor Blue Frost Grass.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was already very satisfied to have obtained the Earthvein Yellow Spirit and did not care about the others. Now, he had to consider how he could take the spiritual medicine and leave this place safely.</p><p>With the experience he had just gained, Qin Sang was much faster when picking the Nine Splendor Blue Frost Grass.</p><p>At this time, the battle in the distance had become much more intense. Qin Sang knew that the Golden Hoop Formation would not be able to hold Fool down for long. He quickly used a jade box to store the Nine Splendor Blue Frost Grass and then headed straight for where the Blue Dew Droplet grew.</p><p>He obtained the Blue Dew Droplet and the Ice Spirit Fruit. Then, he and Shangguan Lifeng returned to the battlefield one after another.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng took out the three spiritual medicines he had picked. Luo Xingnan returned the Spirit Evergreen to Shangguan Lifeng and kept the other two. He looked at Qin Sang as he handed the spiritual medicine to the Cloud Wanderer and his companions, but he did not do anything else.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, do your best to activate the Golden Hoop Formation to its full potential. We can trap Fool for three breaths. Then, immediately descend the mountain. Do not delay at all.”</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer spoke as he crazily poured his spiritual power into the copper hoop. The copper hoop he controlled was similar to the transparent jewel of the Four Clouds Divine Seal and was the core of the entire Golden Hoop Formation.</p><p>At this moment, their destinies were intertwined. When they heard the Cloud Wanderer's warning, including Luo Xingnan, they did not dare to hesitate. They immediately followed the Cloud Wanderer and activated the Golden Hoop Formation with all their might.</p><p>The seven copper hoops surrounded Fool in the middle, trembling and making crisp sounds.</p><p>Then, countless phantoms suddenly appeared and dragged out streaks of yellow light, engulfing Fool. These phantoms fused with each other in the air, forming a huge and solid copper hoop tightly around Fool.</p><p>Fool roared incessantly, but he could not free himself from the copper hoop's bondage in the short term.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer immediately retracted the Golden Hoop Formation and turned to fly down the mountain.</p><p>The others followed closely behind.</p><p>The seven escape lights were of different colors but had similar speeds. It was only because time was sufficient that the Cloud Wanderer and Luo Xingnan intentionally controlled their speed. Qin Sang did not use the Nine Dragons Heavenly Carriage Talisman either.</p><p>The escape lights were clearly divided into two groups. Shangguan Lifeng and Luo Xingnan walked together. The White Robe Scholar followed Qin Sang and his companions closely, surrounding the Cloud Wanderer.</p><p>The two sides subconsciously distanced themselves from each other and did not interfere with each other.</p><p>Until they returned to the restriction, Luo Xingnan did not make any move.</p><p>It seemed that Luo Xingnan had accepted this outcome.</p><p>At the last moment, they saw Fool's fierce figure chasing after them, but as soon as they entered the restriction, the sharp cry immediately disappeared from their ears.</p><p>Fool did not chase after them, which relieved everyone's expressions, but they did not completely relax.</p><p>They exited the restriction even faster than when they came. The exit was just ahead. As long as they passed through the Hook Snake's territory, they could leave this place.</p><p>Before the group could steady themselves, Luo Xingnan glanced at them coldly. Without a word and holding Shangguan Lifeng, he abruptly burst forth.</p><p>In that instant, his speed was at a peak. Apart from him, the others were all at the initial Core Formation stage. Logically speaking, no one could be faster than him.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's intentions were obvious; he wanted to copy Yu Kong's plan to pit the tiger and wolf against each other!</p><p>These giant snakes had suffered many casualties, and the Snake King was also badly wounded and dying. If they were able to work together and make use of the Formation, without alerting the snakes beforehand, they might be able to escape.</p><p>It might actually be a win-win situation.</p><p>But Luo Xingnan naturally couldn't be satisfied with just two spirit medicines!</p><p>Unlike Ge Yuan's anger, Qin Sang and Cloud Wanderer weren't flustered at all. Instead, they sneered at Luo Xingnan's conduct.</p><p>Even if Luo Xingnan was fast, could he outpace Cloud Wanderer's Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat?</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A ray of light flew out from Cloud Wanderer's palms. It grew larger with the wind, revealing the body of the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat.</p><p>"Quickly..."</p><p>Cloud Wanderer and Qin Sang jumped in and went to urge Ge Yuan and the White-robed Scholar. But suddenly, a familiar sharp cry came from overhead.</p><p>The group was shocked and looked up abruptly.</p><p>They saw that the restriction above was shaking and, within the restriction, a colossal shadow was squeezing itself out.</p><p>It was the human-faced owl!</p><p>The human-faced owl had made it through the countless restrictions with difficulty. Its physical form seemed distorted after being squeezed by the restriction. Its cry was pained, but it hadn't suffered any serious injuries.</p><p>Its feathers were unusually bright, with an odd luster. This luster had helped it avoid injury from the restrictions.</p><p>The restriction here couldn't trap the human-faced owl, which greatly astonished the group. They also immediately realized that this was probably deliberately done by the owner of the cave abode.</p><p>After all, the human-faced owl was the guardian beast raised by the owner of the cave abode.</p><p>The human-faced owl looked down from above and let out shrill cries. Its eyes were filled with an intent to kill. It glared fiercely at Qin Sang and the others. This group of evildoers had stolen the medicine and attacked it, and they were its sworn enemies.</p><p>But that wasn't the worst of it.</p><p>What caused the group to panic even more was that the sound of the human-faced owl's cry reverberated through this space, and the ground began to shake. From the abyss ahead, a red fog rose up, and it made a strange sizzling sound.</p><p>This sound was also very familiar to them.</p><p>Luo Xingnan wouldn't even have to do anything; the giant snakes had been awakened by the human-faced owl!</p>
