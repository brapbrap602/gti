<h1>Chapter 1807: The Calamity of the Origin</h1><p>Outside Zhijian Zhenren's cave.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, placing the Chengying Sword on his lap.  He stroked the blade, sensing the seal according to Zhijian Zhenren's instructions.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren was breaking through, and Qin Sang protected him. Jian Nu activated the island's protective formation and guarded the entrance.</p><p>The vegetation was withered and yellow; another autumn had arrived.</p><p>The cave door opened, and Zhijian Zhenren stepped out. Qin Sang, already standing, greeted him, "Congratulations, Daoist Brother!"</p><p>In just half a year, Zhijian Zhenren had successfully advanced to the mid-stage of the Nascent Soul realm, far faster than Qin Sang had anticipated!</p><p>"Thank you, little brother, for protecting me."</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren smiled, his gaze falling on the sword in Qin Sang's hand. "How's the progress?"</p><p>"I've got a lead," Qin Sang said confidently.</p><p>Most inherited magic swords are forged for later generations, bearing unique seals that require special methods to break.</p><p>Without knowing the breaking method, one can only follow Zhijian Zhenren's instructions and try bit by bit, a slow and arduous process.</p><p>Fortunately, as Qin Sang had expected, the seal on the Chengying Sword had weakened over time, and the seal should be broken soon.</p><p>"Daoist Brother has just broken through, and must have many important matters to attend to. I won't disturb you any further. I will celebrate with you another day," Qin Sang bowed, turning towards his own cave.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren watched Qin Sang leave, then pondered for a moment before summoning Jian Nu, ordering him to fetch the messages delivered to the island recently.</p><p>…</p><p>Back in his cave.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately sealed the protective formations. The Chengying Sword flew out of his hand, hovering before him.</p><p>Entering his mind into the sword, Qin Sang looked thoughtful.</p><p>Several days later, he suddenly moved, consecutively performing several hand seals and sending them into the Chengying Sword through the air.</p><p>‘Zheng!’</p><p>A clear and resonant sword sound rang out. The Chengying Sword suddenly emitted a dazzling light, illuminating the cave.</p><p>But the light was fleeting, and the magic sword returned to silence.</p><p>A look of joy flashed across Qin Sang's eyes. He raised his hand, wrapping the sword in flowing light, his hand seals flashing constantly, the colors shifting unpredictably.</p><p>Soon, the Chengying Sword began to vibrate frequently, until finally, a crisp sound like breaking porcelain came from the blade.  A tremendously sharp sword energy erupted in the cave, threatening to shatter the cave's protective formations.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly; his true essence surged towards the front, almost forming a vortex of true essence in mid-air.</p><p>The light dispersed, and the vortex was empty.</p><p>Even the sword shadow was gone.</p><p>But Qin Sang could clearly perceive the powerful sword intent, and the formless sword weapon carrying that intent.</p><p>Or rather, the Chengying Sword itself was formed from this sword intent.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang's mind entered the Chengying Sword, he felt himself instantly pulled into a strange space.</p><p>In a daze, he seemed to see a person.</p><p>This person stood with their back to him, on the peak of a cloud-shrouded mountain, holding a sword in one hand, and slashing forward.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The sword struck.</p><p>There were no surging waves, no collapsing mountains, no reversed rivers.</p><p>An ordinary sword strike, yet it stirred Qin Sang's mind, causing him to abruptly withdraw his consciousness from the sword. His breath was slightly unsteady, and his face showed a look of shock.</p><p>That strike was the legacy of sword intent!</p><p>The Chengying Sword contained no cultivation techniques, no words, and even the appearance of the senior cultivator was unclear.  Only pure sword intent remained.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang understood. The senior cultivator who forged this legacy of sword intent also cultivated the Way of the Killing Sword!</p><p>However, Qin Sang also sensed a significant difference between this person's Way and the "Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen".</p><p>Even within the Way of the Killing Sword, there are many different emphases and branches; they cannot be conflated.</p><p>The Way of the "Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen" is also the Way Qin Sang seeks, focusing more on 'killing', understanding the sword through slaughter.</p><p>The sword cultivator in the sword emphasizes the sword more, controlling the killing Dao through the sword; in the eyes of sword cultivators, this might be the glorious path.</p><p>The cultivation process of the "Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen" shows that each time the creator of the technique breaks through to a new realm, they gain new understanding of the killing Dao, undergoing a transformation.</p><p>The changes in swordsmanship are less obvious than those in the killing Dao.  Even at the Nascent Soul stage, there is still only the Seven Souls Killing Formation; its roots are still the constantly evolving seven killing talismans.</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang understood that the owner of the Chengying Sword and the owner of the "Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen" might have a connection, but their Ways were different.</p><p>He needs to follow the Way of the "Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen"; the sword intent within the Chengying Sword cannot directly enhance his own Way.</p><p>However, receiving the Chengying Sword's sword intent still has great benefits for him.  At the very least, it will significantly improve his swordsmanship.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang's urgent feelings subsided somewhat. After pondering for a while, his brow flashed, and he summoned the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword circled and spun, its body transparent, its spirituality already very obvious, in the process of transforming into a spiritual fetus.</p><p>After consulting Masters Qi and Gu, Qin Sang continuously improved his sword-refining techniques, with pleasing results.</p><p>A thought flickered, and the Yunyou Sword hovered beside the Chengying Sword.</p><p>The Chengying Sword was invisible; only the Yunyou Sword was visible to the naked eye. Qin Sang prepared to attempt refining the former using the latter.</p><p>After unsealing it, Qin Sang had a clearer understanding of the Chengying Sword.</p><p>As a legacy sword, the Chengying Sword was meticulously refined by a predecessor using sword intent. It wasn't merely an invisible sword; it was, in essence, a stream of extremely pure sword intent.</p><p>As the sword intent was refined, it merged with the aura of the refiner's spirit sword, transforming into the spirit sword's sword shadow.</p><p>To simplify, the Chengying Sword might only be attached to the Yunyou Sword, not integrated into it.</p><p>After all, tempering one's spirit sword is part of a sword cultivator's training. The purpose of a legacy sword is guidance and rapid strength improvement for the inheritor; tempering the spirit sword still relies on oneself.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang believed the Chengying Sword might not affect the Yunyou Sword's cultivation of spiritual essence.</p><p>These were still guesses. If it proved impossible, Qin Sang would wait for the Yunyou Sword to develop a spiritual embryo before refining the Chengying Sword, or use another sword.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword was attuned to his will.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Yunyou Sword, generating sword light that enveloped the Chengying Sword, cautiously probing.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>The tension on Qin Sang's face gradually faded, replaced by relief.  The fact proved that refining the Chengying Sword wouldn't impact the Yunyou Sword's spiritual essence; he could proceed with confidence.</p><p>However, after some time, Qin Sang put both swords away, pausing the refinement.</p><p>Since refining the Chengying Sword wasn't very helpful for cultivation, Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry. He prioritized cultivation, placing the Chengying Sword's refinement after comprehending the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal*.</p><p>Despite the short comprehension time, Qin Sang benefited greatly.</p><p>A beam of sword light leaped from the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>The Huying Sword appeared, instantly transforming the cave's scenery; it seemed to contain the starry sky within it.</p><p>Gazing at the Seven Mansions Division Sword Formation, Qin Sang fell into contemplation.</p><p>Before this, he knew he hadn't fully grasped the Seven Mansions Division Sword Formation. Whenever he had time, he would study it.</p><p>Receiving the sword intent inheritance not only greatly increased his swordsmanship but also broadened his horizons.</p><p>"Perhaps, the mastery of the Seven Mansions Division Sword Formation is not far off. I can temporarily spend more time on it…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and he silently thought to himself.</p><p>…</p><p>News of the Sword Master's breakthrough spread, with Youhuang and others visiting to congratulate him.</p><p>Qin Sang also emerged from seclusion, occasionally visiting Hucheng City, but frequently sought instruction in swordsmanship from the Sword Master.</p><p>Feeling the Sword Master's sincere guidance, Qin Sang benefited greatly and was deeply grateful.</p><p>Meanwhile, Master Lingxu sent a bottle of Yinghua Pills.  Qin Sang gave Tianmu Butterfly one every now and then.</p><p>Both were rapidly improving.</p><p>One day.</p><p>A streak of light flew over the water above Sword Heart Island.</p><p>The visitor was a clean-cut young man. After circling the nearby waters for a while, he finally located Sword Heart Island, overjoyed. He accelerated towards the island.</p><p>"Who goes there?"</p><p>Ten li from Sword Heart Island, a shout rang out, accompanied by a powerful pressure.</p><p>The young man's face paled, and he hurriedly stopped. "Junior is here on the orders of Master Boxian, to deliver a message to Senior Qingfeng."</p><p>"Oh? Give me the letter; I'll pass it on to Senior Qingfeng," a black-robed elder appeared.</p><p>The young man dared not ask more, handed over the letter, and respectfully waited outside the island.</p><p>In the cave, Qin Sang received a report from his sword servant and awoke from meditation, murmuring, "I didn't expect it to take ten years. Qingdan is finally ready to act."</p><p>With a gesture, the letter fell into his palm.</p><p>After reading it, Qin Sang said gravely, "Tell Friend Boxian that I will be there in ten days."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The sword servant left.</p><p>Qin Sang fell into thought.</p><p>Ten years later, Qin Sang's interest in the Poison Domain wasn't as strong as before.</p><p>Before agreeing to Qingdan, he didn't know the origin of the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal* or the details of the Chengying Sword.</p><p>Comprehending them would be enough to ensure his combat strength.</p><p>Adding the Poison Dao felt like trying to bite off more than he could chew.  In fact, Qin Sang already felt stretched thin.</p><p>Going to the Poison Domain was merely to find a path.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang wanted to verify his understanding of his cultivation techniques.</p><p>He had a plan:  to venture deep into the Evil Origin and challenge a mid-Nascent Soul stage demonic beast alone.</p><p>The Evil Origin was full of ferocious beasts. If they could help him comprehend the Dao of Killing, he would never fear opponents.</p><p>If the effect was poor, his understanding might be flawed.</p><p>"Settle this matter quickly and then close myself off to cultivate."</p><p>Qin Sang mused, slowly closing his eyes and silently cultivating his inner energy.</p><p>...</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Qin Sang, without disturbing the Sword Master, informed his sword servant and flew northwest.</p><p>Soon, he arrived above a group of islets.</p><p>The islets were all small and desolate, uninhabited.</p><p>"Master Qingfeng is indeed a man of his word. Please come in."</p><p>A person flew from a small island. It was Master Boxian, who looked pleased to see Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed and landed on the island alongside Master Boxian.</p><p>Master Boxian waved his hand, revealing a fairy mansion: "This is one of my secluded palaces..."</p><p>As they spoke, the two entered the mansion and met Master Qingdan.</p><p>After brief pleasantries, they got down to business.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Master Qingdan and said, "Where is Master Yunwei?"</p><p>Master Qingdan shook his head.  "Our sect suffered heavy losses last time, and we don't have enough people left to maintain the formation. For ten years, Master Boxian and I have tried to improve the array, but to no avail.  Without the protection of the formation, Yunwei and the others would only be a burden. This time, only the three of us will go!"</p><p>Master Boxian interjected, "Master Qingfeng must have made some preparations as well?"</p><p>"I've done my best."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He had consulted Master Lingxu about antidote-type pills, discovering that highly potent pills were extremely expensive, even for Master Lingxu to easily produce.</p><p>And pills with weaker effects were inferior to the fat silkworm's poison pills.</p><p>Master Qingdan nodded. "I have also gathered some antidotal treasures. The three of us working together, entering the heart of the Poison Domain should pose no problem.  We should proceed cautiously; if we fail this time, we can try again."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>He really didn't want to waste too much of their time.</p><p>Moreover, various signs indicated that the Evil Source was not peaceful, with demonic god worship rampant.</p><p>The Gui Fang Kingdom and the Daoist Court were scheming something; beneath the calm surface, a volcano was brewing.</p><p>Under such circumstances, frequent travel between the two places was unwise.</p><p>"Have either of you heard anything? What does the Daoist Court plan to do about the demonic god?" Qin Sang asked gravely.</p><p>Master Qingdan hesitated, then said with embarrassment, "I've been focused on the Poison Domain matter and haven't paid attention to the broader situation..."</p><p>Sects like Mount Lougu were accustomed to the Daoist Court's existence; the threat of demons was the Daoist Court's responsibility.</p><p>They only needed to wait for the Daoist Court's summons, send people to join the battle, and repel the demons.</p><p>Centuries of history proved that the Daoist Court was relatively just.</p><p>Master Boxian snorted, "Have you two forgotten those lands? Even the highest-ranking Yuehuang only holds the Shengxuan position, what kind of god is that? Just a watchdog for the Daoist Court! The demons of Gui Fang are trying to follow the same path. What kind of waves can they make?"</p><p>Qin Sang disagreed with Master Boxian's assessment, but didn't say anything.</p><p>Master Qingdan said, "Rest assured, I've investigated. The Daoist Court and Gui Fang haven't sent anyone to the Jushan altar. At least inside the altar, we're safe. If this happens again, I will thoroughly investigate."</p><p>The three then discussed their itinerary.</p><p>Having already made their preparations, they left the island that same day, flying north to the border of the Xingdao Fairy Lake.</p><p>No one was competing with them for the Poison Domain; there was no need to rush, unlike their previous hurried flight.</p><p>The three concealed their presence, using concealment techniques, and proceeded on foot, avoiding disturbing the beasts.</p><p>They weren't afraid of the beasts, but they needed to be wary of the demons of Gui Fang.</p><p>Half a month later.</p><p>Standing atop a mountain, gazing at a mountain pass, the three looked serious.</p><p>"It's a demon temple. The rumors are true; the demons' influence is reaching the heartland of the Daoist sects," Master Boxian said gravely.</p><p>It was said that the shadow of the demonic god was also appearing in Zhongmao and Baishi.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but remember the snake demon he had subdued years ago.</p><p>Could the legacy the snake demon received be a hidden hand left by Gui Fang, blossoming everywhere, making it difficult for the Daoist Court to manage?</p><p>The Daoist Court hadn't yet launched a large-scale military campaign to destroy temples and quell demonic influence. The demons would surely become even more rampant in the future.</p><p>"Let's go around."</p><p>Master Qingdan said in a low voice.</p><p>The three took one last look at the crude temple and the kneeling ghost people in the mountain pass, then quietly bypassed the area.</p><p>Along the way, they were forced to detour several times, avoiding combat as much as possible, finally reaching the Jushan altar safely.</p><p>The auspicious clouds covering the altar had stabilized; the fluctuations were no longer overflowing, and the beasts had returned to the plains before the auspicious clouds, bustling with activity.</p><p>Out of caution, the three lingered in the vicinity for several days, scouting the enemy before quickly crossing the plains and entering the Jushan altar.</p>
