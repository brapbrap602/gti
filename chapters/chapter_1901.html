<h1>Chapter 1892: Yang Shen</h1><p>Heavenly lightning coursed through the realm.</p><p>The tide of beasts showed a marked pause, fear once again taking hold. In many places, the beast tide showed signs of retreat.</p><p>Ferocious beasts collided with each other, their ranks thrown into utter chaos.</p><p>Even the most malevolent and savage beasts trembled at this moment.</p><p>The lightning hadn't struck them directly, but in the eyes of all living beings, the power of the Thunder Ancestor was no different from the divine might of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p>……</p><p>Ghost Fang Nation.</p><p>Great Sage Mansion.</p><p>The drumbeat ceased.</p><p>A Demon King, drumstick in hand, stared blankly at the sky, watching the lightning split the void.</p><p>The other Demon Kings adopted similar postures.</p><p>A deathly silence fell over the mansion.</p><p>Despair gripped the hearts of the demons.</p><p>This was the power of the Thunder Ancestor!</p><p>If it were directed here, all demon cultivators and Demon Kings would be annihilated along with the Great Sage Mansion.</p><p>The Immortal Dao's foundation was so terrifying. How could Ghost Fang Nation possibly be its match? Unless the Demon Calling Drum could summon Heavenly Master level beasts, what use was their exhausted state?</p><p>Thinking of this, the demons couldn't help but look towards the bright moon.</p><p>The Great Sage of the Demon race hadn't given up. It was still fighting!</p><p>……</p><p>Before the Southern Heaven Gate.</p><p>The duel between Celestial Master Tian Yue and the Great Sage of the Demon race paused due to the divine might of the Thunder Ancestor.</p><p>Celestial Master Tian Yue leaned on his Broken Army Divine Sword, his breath more ragged and disordered than before, yet his eyes burned ever brighter and more intimidating.</p><p>His entire being resembled an unsheathed blade, ready to sever all enemies!</p><p>A Dao Court True Monarch cast a talisman, and heavenly dew descended.</p><p>Celestial Master Tian Yue absorbed the dew, his complexion regaining some color.  Conversely, for the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon, the heavenly dew was no different from poison.</p><p>With one side waning and the other waxing, Celestial Master Tian Yue's situation improved somewhat, but only marginally.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The spirit sword flew back to Celestial Master Tian Yue, radiating a cold, sharp light.</p><p>Celestial Master Tian Yue withdrew his gaze from the void and fixed it on the formidable foe before him.  Noticing the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon's strange behavior, he furrowed his brow, a sense of foreboding washing over him.</p><p>Since the Immortal Dao had summoned the Thunder Ancestor, the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon had ceased its fierce assault. Its dragon body blocked the Heaven Gate as it glared at Celestial Master Tian Yue with such hatred that it seemed to want to devour him alive and grind his bones to dust.</p><p>As if awed by the power of the Thunder Ancestor, the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon remained motionless for a long time, but the Qi within its body was undergoing earth-shattering changes.</p><p>Before the Dragon Soared to the Nine Heavens, it had swallowed a Golden Core.</p><p>This core was refined from the demon core of the previous Great Sage.</p><p>It could have been used for a breakthrough, but the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon, possessing extraordinary talent, had achieved the Great Sage position on its own and thus treasured the core.</p><p>Most importantly, this core shared the same bloodline as it, making refining it far easier than other pills.</p><p>While battling with Celestial Master Tian Yue, the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon had been silently refining the Golden Core.</p><p>A dragon's roar echoed.</p><p>The Five-Clawed Golden Dragon raised its head high, golden light illuminating the heavens, obscuring the lunar halo.</p><p>It was actually breaking through mid-battle!</p><p>Such a breakthrough would inevitably leave hidden dangers, but this was its only chance, taking advantage of the Dao Court's preoccupation with external enemies to force its way into the Divine Court.</p><p>Even if it couldn't occupy the Divine Court alone, if it could force the Immortal Dao to compromise with Ghost Fang Nation, it would be a victory. At the very least, they wouldn't repeat their ancestors' mistakes and become the Immortal Dao's demonic soldier slaves.</p><p>Even from the ground, it was clearly visible.</p><p>As the heavenly thunder dissipated, a golden sun replaced the bright moon, hanging high in the sky.</p><p>Celestial Master Tian Yue straightened up, his expression grave, but he showed no sign of retreat.</p><p>Facing a powerful enemy, he displayed no fear, only boundless fighting spirit.</p><p>His natal spirit sword, sensing its master's will, emitted a clear, resonant hum, as if eager for battle.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A golden dragon claw tore through the void, a fierce wind buffeting Celestial Master Tian Yue.</p><p>His robes billowed as he laughed aloud, "Excellent!"</p><p>In the next moment, a ten-thousand-zhang sword light pierced the heavens!</p><p>……</p><p>White Stone Governance Altar.</p><p>Kun Dao sat in meditation on the altar, her gaze fixed on the sky.</p><p>She knew there was another change at the Heaven Gate, but she was nearing the end of her strength, unable to assist Celestial Master Tian Yue.</p><p>She glanced one last time into the depths of the void. The void storm caused by the power of the Thunder Ancestor was intensifying.</p><p>She turned her gaze towards Central Prosperity Governance.</p><p>True Monarch Zhang was still in secluded cultivation, attempting a breakthrough!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Kun Dao flicked her jade finger, and the White Stone Governance Seal flew from her hand, transforming into a stream of light that shot towards the west.</p><p>……</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind was still in a state of bewilderment, not fully recovered from the impact of the Thunder Ancestor's power.</p><p>The entire process of invoking the divine presence felt like a fleeting dream.</p><p>The sensation was beyond description, exceeding his cultivation level and comprehension.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang, focused on resisting the mental onslaught, still couldn't explain how the Thunder Ancestor's power had descended or how he had unleashed it from his fingertips.</p><p>If the Thunder Ancestor's power were likened to river water, Qin Sang's body was a section of the riverbed.</p><p>The river water rushed through, but there would always be 'water stains' remaining.</p><p>Within these residual memories, there seemed to be something extremely valuable, pushing open a crack in a door for Qin Sang.</p><p>Behind that door lay an incredibly mysterious realm, another world that held infinite allure for any cultivator, and for Qin Sang, it held an immense attraction.</p><p>He was so eager to push it open, to comprehend it, that he didn't even bother to check if he was injured.</p><p>But the situation didn't allow him to do so.</p><p>The shadowy figure's gaze was like a sharp knife, trying to dissect Qin Sang's body. The tone, filled with intense malice, startled Qin Sang and sent chills down his spine.</p><p>This newcomer was hostile!</p><p>Qin Sang realized he was still in danger, forcing himself to regain his composure.</p><p>"Emperor Sword? What Emperor Sword? What is he talking about?"</p><p>Qin Sang was bewildered, unsure even of the shadowy figure's identity.</p><p>He could be certain that he had never encountered this person before, neither in this realm nor the Storm Realm. There was no grievance between them.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed something from the figure's gaze.</p><p>The figure's eyes burned intensely, fixated on Qin Sang's Qi Sea, with greed and fanaticism in its depths.</p><p>"Emperor Sword? Could it be the Earth Slaughter Sword?"</p><p>Qin Sang considered the objects within his body, and only the Earth Slaughter Sword fit the figure's description.</p><p>What was the true origin of the Earth Slaughter Sword? Why was it called the Emperor Sword? This figure seemed to be from a foreign realm. How did he know about the Earth Slaughter Sword and its presence within him?</p><p>That palm print, which shattered the void before him, was so close, it couldn't have been a coincidence. He must have been targeted beforehand!</p><p>Countless questions filled his mind, but Qin Sang's reaction was not slow. He instinctively moved away from the enemy.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Heavenly Patrol Chariot was destroyed, having fallen into the sea of clouds below, making it impossible for him to rely on its instantaneous movement to escape.</p><p>The power of the Thunder Ancestor was also exhausted. He could only rely on himself!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>With a powerful flap of his phoenix wings, Qin Sang instantly transformed into a bolt of lightning, shooting backwards.</p><p>At this moment, he had no other thoughts, only to do his utmost and leave the rest to fate.</p><p>The palm print, like the silver threads, could shatter the void and pierce the Divine Court's barrier, indicating that its owner's cultivation was not much inferior to the owner of the silver threads.</p><p>And to repel the silver threads, it had taken the summoning of the Thunder Ancestor!</p><p>If the shadowy figure was the owner of the palm print, no matter what Qin Sang did, it would be futile.</p><p>However, facing the shadowy figure, the pressure Qin Sang felt wasn't as terrifying.  It wasn't to the point where he felt completely unable to resist.</p><p>Perhaps the figure's original cultivation was very high, but breaking into the Divine Court had exacted an extraordinary price, severely injuring him. After all, the figure's expression and cries when emerging from the blood pool indicated that the process had been incredibly painful.</p><p>Or perhaps the figure wasn't the owner of the palm print, but had been forcibly sent in.</p><p>In this critical moment, Qin Sang couldn't and wouldn't delve into it.</p><p>He had to do everything in his power to save himself, even if it only bought him a moment.  A moment was a chance to survive!</p><p>The fact that he had been chosen to channel the Thunder Ancestor indicated that someone had been watching him – whether it was Celestial Master Tian Yue, the Dao Court True Monarch, or the mysterious person mentioned by Celestial Master Tian Yue.</p><p>He only hoped they wouldn't use him and discard him.</p><p>As soon as he moved, Qin Sang realized his condition wasn't as dire as he'd imagined. At least, he still had the ability to fight.</p><p>In this instant, Qin Sang couldn't recall how much he had done, but he had pushed himself to the limit.</p><p>His blood roared within him, his body emitting a faint golden light, with the faint image of inner armor shimmering around him.</p><p>The Great Vajra Wheel Seal and the Bright Mountain Armor protected him.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The sound of a sword resonated through the vast Divine Court.</p><p>A point of sword light shot out from between his eyebrows.</p><p>The Wandering Cloud Sword revealed its full sharpness, its light parting clouds and mist, slashing towards the enemy.</p><p>Within his Qi Sea.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly spread its wings, the Heavenly Eye patterns on its wings spinning rapidly. Blood vessels spread within the Heavenly Eyes as it fully activated its Heavenly Eye divine ability, locking onto the shadowy figure's every move.</p><p>……</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang was calling out to the Vermillion Bird fledgling, hoping to gain its assistance in activating the Sun God Tree.</p><p>Unfortunately, his calls were met with silence.  The Vermillion Bird fledgling didn't respond.</p><p>Had the power of the Thunder Ancestor harmed it?</p><p>With his own survival at stake, Qin Sang couldn't worry about the Vermillion Bird fledgling. He unleashed all the fastest divine abilities and Dao arts he could muster.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were all useless!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Sword intent locked onto the shadowy figure, sword light flashing like lightning.</p><p>The figure's sneer turned into a cold smirk. A point of blood light flickered within its body, then turned into nothingness, vanishing into thin air.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang lost track of the figure. It had vanished from under his Heavenly Eye divine ability.</p><p>No, not entirely without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang was horrified to discover thin blood-red threads appearing in the void, crisscrossing like a vast net, omnipresent.</p><p>The blood net instantly unfolded and then contracted.</p><p>Qin Sang only saw a flash of blood light as the blood net reformed before him.  A strange face appeared, the face of the shadowy figure.</p><p>The figure’s face was practically touching Qin Sang’s, mere inches away!</p><p>The Thunder Escape technique was meaningless against the shadowy figure.</p><p>"This is… a Yang Shen!"</p><p>In recent years, Qin Sang had frequented the White Stone Governance Altar and had been granted access to certain Daoist scriptures. He had seen similar descriptions.</p><p>Just as body cultivators used Inner Scenery and Outer Scenery to vividly describe the Nascent Soul and Soul Formation realms,</p><p>Spirit cultivators had similar terms: Yin Shen and Yang Shen.</p><p>Extreme spirit cultivators, upon cultivating a Yang Shen, would even discard their physical bodies, referring to it as shedding their mortal coil, becoming unbound and existing solely as a Yang Shen.</p><p>It was said that a powerful Yang Shen could merge with heaven and earth, traversing the realms without restriction.</p><p>This meant that the shadowy figure was at least a Soul Formation cultivator!</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Blood light appeared in the figure's pupils, a dull gray, similar to the color of the blood pool, with a strange rune flickering within.</p><p>The rune imprinted itself onto Qin Sang’s eyes, his pupils reflecting the same rune.</p><p>Simultaneously, the shadowy figure transformed into a blood thread once more, penetrating Qin Sang's orifices, entering his body directly through his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang was powerless to resist.</p><p>His consciousness was clear.</p><p>The blood-red rune clearly had a charm-like or controlling effect, but its power was far less than the Thunder Ancestor's, unable to breach the Jade Buddha's defenses.  It was ineffective against Qin Sang.</p><p>However, the Jade Buddha couldn't save him.</p><p>The moment the figure possessed him, the light in Qin Sang's eyes vanished, his entire body stiffening.</p><p>He felt he had lost control of his physical body.  His blood and True Essence were practically frozen.</p><p>Powerful spirit cultivators were unpredictable, possessing numerous methods to deal with him.  The Jade Buddha wasn't omnipotent.</p><p>As expected, the shadowy figure lunged at Qin Sang's nascent soul without hesitation.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang didn't attempt to escape with his nascent soul. He stood motionless, seemingly giving up resistance.</p><p>However, within the stillness, there was an imperceptible fluctuation.</p><p>At the brink of life and death, Qin Sang was utterly oblivious, disregarding the powerful enemy.  Only one scripture occupied his mind – the Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture!</p><p>This scripture was obtained from the Green Fox Saint King, and Qin Sang, of course, already knew its origins.</p><p>Cultivating this scripture allowed one to actively attract Heavenly Devils to temper their spirit.</p><p>Sage Hui Guang had attempted to use this scripture to harm him, but unexpectedly, Qin Sang had instead used it to condense the Unborn Devil Seal and break through to the Nascent Soul realm!</p><p>However, cultivating this scripture had left behind hidden dangers.</p><p>Back then, the two strands of demonic intent he had summoned had behaved strangely. The first had vanished without a trace, seemingly screaming before its disappearance.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected it might be related to the Heavenly Dao’s Demonic Sound.</p><p>If his suspicions were correct, the master of the second strand of demonic intent must be incredibly powerful.</p><p>He had been targeted by this Heavenly Devil, and even with the Jade Buddha's protection, he couldn't help but feel apprehensive.</p><p>He hadn’t anticipated that, before he could consider how to deal with the demonic tribulation during his breakthrough, he would have to actively summon a Heavenly Devil once again!</p><p>According to the scripture, summoning a Heavenly Devil required setting up an altar.</p><p>The Great Dao was interconnected.</p><p>There were probably few in the world more proficient in this than the Immortal Dao, whose cultivation practices were intimately linked to altars.</p><p>Sects had sect altars, the Dao Court had governance altars and pacification altars.</p><p>Bestowing titles required altars, cultivation required cultivating altars, and summoning deities, generals, or initiating any action required first establishing a mystical altar.</p><p>To cultivate the Immortal Dao's methods, Qin Sang naturally had to delve deep into this aspect.</p><p>As the saying went, divine responses are like echoes, this action and that response, this feeling and that spirit, merging oneself with the other, without being bound by external objects.</p><p>Within the Immortal Dao, as long as one’s cultivation was sufficiently high, performing rituals and summoning deities didn't require relying on a physical altar.</p><p>At the Nascent Soul realm, one had to rely on external objects and refine an altar.  Now, Qin Sang was no longer the same.  Having experienced summoning a Heavenly Devil once before, he had long since grasped the profound meaning and principles of this scripture.  Naturally, he didn't need to go through such trouble.</p><p>With the power of his divine sense, he established a formless altar!</p><p>Instantly, an endless chill enveloped Qin Sang.</p><p>He felt as though his consciousness was solidifying.  This Heavenly Devil's demonic intent was even more terrifying than the last, as if it had been waiting for him.</p><p>The moment the connection was established,</p><p>It descended!</p><p>At this moment, the shadowy figure was about to pounce on Qin Sang’s nascent soul when it suddenly felt a chill and froze, its face filled with shock.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
