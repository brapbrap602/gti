Chapter 1860: Water Nourishes Wood


Withered leaves scattered in the wind.
Spiritual banners stood tall, their surfaces fluttering.
Qin Sang retreated into the formation, immediately swallowing a bottle of medicinal pills. He held the Five Elements Crown in his palm, diverting a portion of his divine sense to soothe the restless artifact spirit.
He would likely rely on this treasure later, and needed to appease the spirit quickly to have another chance to unleash the Great Five Elements Sealing Divine Light.
At this moment, a shadow fell over the sky barrier, plunging it into sudden darkness as layers of ethereal ripples washed over it.
‘Boom!’
The sky barrier tore open, faintly revealing a serpentine figure resembling a Flood Dragon.
All the spiritual banners trembled in unison. Azure Empyrean Qi flowed within the formation, converging towards the center as the banners vibrated, coalescing into a crescent-shaped, azure blade.
The blade pointed obliquely at the sky barrier.
‘Swish!’
Azure blade light shot skyward!
The Wood Spiritual Qi in the void, as if drawn by an irresistible force, surged madly towards the blade.
The blade light, like a bottomless abyss, accepted all that came, growing ever brighter and more dazzling. In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a colossal blade hundreds of feet long, its momentum swelling to a terrifying degree.
This single strike cleaved the sky barrier.
‘Poof!’
The surging ethereal ripples were split apart by the blade. The Blackfish Manifestation within the water ripples narrowed its gaze, its long tail whipping fiercely as it leaped into the air.
The Devouring Clam beneath it seamlessly merged with the ethereal ripples, appearing before the blade light in the next instant.
Now only the size of a palm, the Devouring Clam opened its two shells slightly, its gaping maw aimed directly at the blade light. Suddenly, it emitted a blinding white light.
As the blade light touched the white light, it seemed to encounter an infinite suction, twisting and deforming.
Finally, the colossal blade, over a hundred feet long, was completely swallowed by the seemingly diminutive Devouring Clam.
‘Snap!’
The clam shells closed, and all light vanished in an instant.
‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’
The Devouring Clam vibrated wildly. With a splash, the ethereal ripples surged back, submerging the clam, and the tremors gradually weakened.
The ethereal ripples ceased their spread, gathering around the Blackfish Manifestation.
The Blackfish Manifestation's gaze pierced the sky barrier, taking in the scene below, its eyes flickering uncertainly.
Seeing Qin Sang take refuge in the formation and cease his flight, Ling Youwang wasn't in a hurry to pursue. He hovered above, observing the illusory landscape.
Within the formation.
Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, his eyes slightly closed.
Events had unfolded too quickly, leaving no time for more elaborate preparations. Qin Sang had only managed to deploy this formation.
This formation was a banner array he had acquired years ago in Jushan, possessing both offensive and defensive capabilities, and quite profound in its workings.
Because the formation's properties were particularly well-suited to the Jungle Domain, Qin Sang had paid a hefty price to acquire it.
The Jungle Domain was already highly advantageous to him. With this banner array, Qin Sang was confident against any opponent of the same cultivation level.  Thus, after obtaining the array, he had only mastered its deployment without expending further effort to refine and enhance it.
But who could have foreseen that he would attract a Demon King?
During the pursuit, Ling Youwang had displayed incredibly keen spiritual senses. Even with the spiritual banners merged with the trees, it was difficult to conceal them from his perception.
As expected, the previous strike had failed to harm Ling Youwang in the slightest.
It was better to openly reveal the banner array, making Ling Youwang wary and buying himself some time.
One fish, one man, one sky, one earth, locked in a standoff across the void.
The Blackfish Manifestation swam restlessly within the ethereal ripples, like a hunter seeking the perfect moment to strike.
After its initial attack, the banner array seemed to fall silent. A new crescent blade condensed within the formation, poised to strike.
At this moment, Ling Youwang understood why Qin Sang had desperately fled here; he had preemptively arranged a supporting formation.
In this location, the formation’s power far surpassed its potential elsewhere.
However, relying on a mere banner array to force him back was insufficient.
If this was all the boy had to offer, his death sentence could be pronounced!
Beneath the sky barrier, the vibrant forest stretched as far as the eye could see.
Ling Youwang took it all in, confirming no other hidden dangers. A sneer flashed in his eyes as he steered the ethereal ripples, tearing open the sky barrier and descending into the Jungle Domain.
'Splash!'
Ethereal water cascaded from the heavens.
A black waterfall hung in the sky, its waves churning. The Blackfish Manifestation resembled a Flood Dragon, swimming down within its current.
Qin Sang seemed oblivious to the scene above, his eyes closed, standing motionless beneath the banner array.
Battered by the waterfall and the Blackfish Manifestation, the banner surfaces flapped wildly. The blade shadow within the formation, instead of striking, shattered with a 'bang,' reverting to Azure Empyrean Qi that swirled around the formation.
‘Whoosh… Whoosh… Whoosh…’
The surrounding Wood Spiritual Qi was also stirred, converging and initially rotating under the influence of the Azure Empyrean Qi, forming a massive vortex above the banner array.
As the Wood Spiritual Qi grew increasingly dense, a thick azure light enveloped the formation like a heavy canopy.
‘Boom!’
The waterfall slammed heavily onto the canopy, shaking the earth. The aftershocks swept outwards, snapping and uprooting vast swathes of ancient trees, leaving a scene of devastation.
Despite the immense force, the waterfall failed to penetrate the canopy. It merely caused the canopy to tremble, unable to harm Qin Sang within the formation.
Just then, the Blackfish Manifestation arrived on the heels of the aftershocks, looking down from above.  Its two long barbels suddenly lashed out.
Simultaneously, the Devouring Clam materialized beside the Blackfish Manifestation, the spiritual treasure inverted, its two shells opened to their fullest extent.
‘Splash… Splash… Splash…’
The ethereal ripples parted into two streams as if guided by some unseen force, flowing towards either side of the canopy and solidifying there.
The waves piled higher and higher, rapidly forming two towering cliffs of water, trapping Qin Sang and the banner array between them.
The two waves resembled the Devouring Clam. The instant they took shape, they crashed inwards with a deafening roar.
‘Boom!’
The cliffs collapsed with earth-shattering force.
The terrifying water waves were merely a facade. The banner array endured an unimaginable compressive force, the canopy deforming instantly, several points weakening, giving the impression that it could burst at any moment.
‘Crack!’
Two bolts of lightning suddenly arced through the darkness, striking the canopy almost simultaneously.
The lightning bolts were, in fact, the Blackfish Manifestation's barbels, still fused with the spiritual treasure and not yet retracted.
The barbels left two distinct whip marks on the canopy's surface. Before the fissures could close, they sprang back, lashing out again.
Bolts of lightning, like a torrential downpour, relentlessly bombarded the canopy.
Even with the formation's power and the canopy's resilience, it couldn’t withstand the continuous assault from the two spiritual treasures.
‘Bang! Bang! Bang…’
‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’
…
The spiritual formation trembled, the azure light on the banner surfaces fluctuating violently.
At this point, Qin Sang finally opened his eyes, storing the Five Elements Crown in his sleeve. He looked inwards at his Qi Sea, sighing softly. Then, he looked up at the sky, his entire body undergoing a dramatic transformation.
He fully unleashed his Spiritual Wood Body. His body rapidly grew taller, his limbs elongated, his skin becoming rough, the poisonous hairs on his body resembling moss on tree bark.
In this moment, Qin Sang completely transformed into a Tree Spirit!
Just then, the barbels struck the canopy again, finally tearing it apart. The water from the towering waves surged in, shattering the canopy beyond repair.
Cracks appeared on the poles of some of the spiritual banners, and some surfaces were about to detach from their poles.
Qin Sang's eyes flashed. With a wave of his sleeve, he swept up the remnants of the formation, transforming into a withered tree.
Ling Youwang immediately sensed the disappearance of the banner formation and its aura.  His attacks struck empty air. Surprise flickered in his eyes as he abruptly turned his gaze towards a distant ancient tree.
The ancient tree withered in a single breath, its leaves turning yellow and falling. A towering Tree Spirit emerged from its trunk, leaving the withered husk behind.  It locked eyes with Ling Youwang, its gaze unflinching.
From the poisonous hairs covering his body to his transformation into a Tree Spirit, Qin Sang’s appearance had been consistently bizarre.
Through his aura, it was clear that the Tree Spirit was indeed Qin Sang.  The Blackfish Manifestation’s surprise deepened as it noticed that Qin Sang’s depleted Qi and blood had been fully restored in a short time.
Had he consumed some precious spiritual medicine, or did this place hold some other secret?
Upon ascending to the Demon King rank, one could directly draw upon the power of the external heavens to nourish oneself. Even after severing his cultivation, Ling Youwang could still utilize his remaining Manifestation to retain some of his Demon King divine abilities.
Although it was far from his peak strength, while his cultivation seemed comparable to a peak-stage Demon Marquis, his recovery speed was unmatched by any Demon Marquis. He had pursued Qin Sang for so long without showing any signs of fatigue.
Qin Sang clearly hadn’t reached this level yet, so why was his recovery so swift?
Ling Youwang carefully scrutinized Qin Sang, sensing the unique aura of the Spiritual Wood Body.  A faint conjecture formed in his mind.  With a thought, his two barbels lashed out at Qin Sang.
White barbel shadows streaked through the air.
Qin Sang's pupils constricted sharply.
In this moment, his vision seemed to contain only these two bolts of lightning.  An inexplicable feeling of impending annihilation filled his heart.  He didn't dare to be careless.  Silently activating the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, he threw a punch.
‘Boom!’
The fierce fist wind created a thunderous boom in the void, colliding with the two bolts of lightning.
‘Crack!’
‘Crack!’
Qin Sang’s arm trembled, and he staggered backward. Then, a flash of white appeared before his eyes as the barbels attacked again.
The barbels were like two Flood Dragons, incredibly agile.
Relying on his Spiritual Wood Body, the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, the Mingshan Armor, and occasionally wielding the Cloudroaming Sword to break free, Qin Sang unexpectedly fought Ling Youwang to a standstill.
Qin Sang remained vigilant, directing his Heaven's Eye Butterfly to monitor the Devouring Clam's movements.  Unexpectedly, Ling Youwang showed no intention of using the treasure, only manipulating his two barbels to entangle him.
This played right into Qin Sang’s hands. He abruptly abandoned his defensive stance, turning to pounce on the Blackfish Manifestation, launching a reckless counterattack.
Their battlefield shifted constantly, leaving a trail of swirling dust and debris, wreaking havoc upon the Jungle Domain.
Within the dust clouds, the figures of a monstrous fish and a Tree Spirit could be seen clashing incessantly, battling until the sky grew dark.
‘Boom!’
After a tremendous explosion, the two figures separated the instant they touched. Qin Sang flew back thousands of feet, gasping for breath, the ferocity in his eyes undiminished.
The Blackfish Manifestation’s expression also darkened, clearly not unscathed.
Excruciating pain radiated throughout his body.  His internal injuries and depleted Qi and blood testified to the intensity of the battle. Yet, Qin Sang showed no sign of retreat.  With a shake of his shoulders, azure light emanated from his body.
The surrounding Wood Spiritual Qi surged into Qin Sang’s body like water being drawn into a whale’s maw. His wounds healed, and his aura swelled at a visible rate.
“Just as I thought!”
Witnessing this scene, Ling Youwang's expression shifted slightly, his suspicions confirmed.
His eyes held no surprise, only a trace of mockery. He chuckled coldly, "All show and no substance!"
Meeting Ling Youwang’s gaze, Qin Sang’s heart lurched, a sense of foreboding washing over him. The confidence he derived from the Jungle Domain seemed to waver.
Then, the Blackfish Manifestation flicked its tail, rising into the air. All the ethereal ripples followed, transforming into thick rain clouds above, covering a vast portion of the sky barrier.
'Splash!'
Suddenly, torrential rain poured down.
The downpour was incredibly fierce. Qin Sang stood alone in the storm, unable to discern Ling Youwang’s intentions.  He dared not let the raindrops touch him, circulating his True Essence to repel the water.
He soon discovered, however, that the rainwater seemed to possess no special properties. They were ordinary raindrops, devoid of any destructive power.
The downpour showed no signs of stopping.  The rainwater accumulated on the ground, filling pits and valleys, converging into rivers that flowed freely across the land.
The air became saturated with moisture, eagerly absorbed by the vegetation.
Then, a strange phenomenon occurred. The ancient trees within the downpour’s reach, as if nourished, began to grow at an incredible rate.
The ancient trees destroyed in the battle were reborn.
New saplings sprouted, growing into towering trees in mere breaths, their growth continuing unabated.
Soon, the jungle in this area towered over its surroundings, standing out conspicuously.
As the trees grew rapidly, the Wood Spiritual Qi here became increasingly dense.
"Water Nourishes Wood?"
Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, guessing the reason behind this transformation.  It seemed related to the Five Elements Cycle of Generation.
But why would Ling Youwang do this?
This act was no different from supplying him with Wood Spiritual Qi.  The more Wood Spiritual Qi, the more advantageous it was for him.  How was this different from Ling Youwang actively aiding his enemy?
But when Qin Sang continued to circulate his Spiritual Wood Body, he was horrified to discover an unexpected resistance when absorbing the Wood Spiritual Qi.  The more nascent Wood Spiritual Qi there was, the more pronounced the resistance became, even affecting the normal Wood Spiritual Qi.
At this moment, Qin Sang finally understood Ling Youwang's intentions!
Through some unknown divine ability, the Wood Spiritual Qi generated by the ethereal water nourishing the vegetation actually repelled his Spiritual Wood Body, as if it were still under Ling Youwang's control.
This Wood Spiritual Qi was mixed with the normal Wood Spiritual Qi.
Even if it couldn't completely block Qin Sang from absorbing Wood Spiritual Qi, it could significantly slow his recovery speed and increase the burden on his body during recovery, until he could no longer bear it.
Ling Youwang had exploited the situation, using this method to counter the otherwise invincible Acquired Woodman Stele!
Raindrops pelted the ground, their patter echoing in Qin Sang’s heart.
In the next moment, Qin Sang’s body stiffened, transforming into a withered tree. He emerged from an ancient tree outside the downpour.
Ling Youwang, after all, no longer possessed the cultivation of a Demon King. His divine abilities couldn't cover the entire jungle, much less convert all the boundless Wood Spiritual Qi here for his own use.  Qin Sang could completely rely on his Shifting divine ability to move constantly, wearing down Ling Youwang.
Unexpectedly, when Qin Sang looked up, he saw the Devouring Clam appear above, instantly absorbing the rainwater below.  The jungle there returned to normal.
The Devouring Clam then shifted direction, aiming at Qin Sang’s current location, releasing an endless deluge.
The torrential rain pursued him relentlessly.
In an instant, the surroundings transformed into a watery expanse.  Two long barbels, accompanied by the downpour, lashed down like lightning.
Qin Sang, like a trapped beast in the rain, shifted away after a brief struggle, recovering elsewhere.
Ling Youwang seemed to have exhausted his tricks, unable to restrict his Shifting divine ability any further.
But Qin Sang knew it couldn't be that simple. He racked his brains, searching for a way to break this deadlock.
…
At this time, neither of the combatants noticed a figure appear outside the sky barrier, glancing towards them before fading away, silently approaching the barrier. (End of Chapter)
