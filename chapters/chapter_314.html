<h1>Chapter 307: The Kill</h1><p>“Good!”</p><p>Qin Sang hid Yun Youzi in a cave. When he came out, he looked up and saw Luo Xingnan boldly pursuing him without any attempt at concealment.</p><p>The depletion of his spiritual power was a ruse.</p><p>He had flown so far on the Spirit Bamboo flying boat only to create distance from Luo Xingnan and buy himself time. He certainly wasn't going to wait until his spiritual power was completely exhausted.</p><p>However, the cramping pain in his dantian from overuse of spirit pills and stones was real.</p><p>Qin Sang's face paled slightly. He pressed his hand against his dantian, ignoring the pain, and with a cold laugh, his figure flickered and vanished.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>As Luo Xingnan flew towards the mountains, a flash of green light suddenly erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang, wielding the Jade Ruyi, soared into the sky like a dragon emerging from the water.</p><p>The Jade Ruyi appeared and closed in on Luo Xingnan in the blink of an eye.</p><p>If it were anyone else, caught off guard by a surprise attack from a talisman treasure, they would likely be doomed, perishing under its power.</p><p>Facing the menacing Jade Ruyi, Luo Xingnan's face showed no trace of panic. Instead, he sneered and suddenly raised his hand. A small, silver-white knife flew out from his palm.</p><p>The knife had a peculiar shape, somewhat resembling a dagger, with a slightly upturned tip and a jade-laced hilt, gleaming brightly.</p><p>With a flick of Luo Xingnan's wrist, the silver knife's hilt twitched, moving from stillness to motion like a darting fish, shooting straight towards the Jade Ruyi.</p><p>“Did you really think you were the only one with a talisman treasure? If you had fled alone, I might have spared you the trouble,” Luo Xingnan said scornfully, his voice dripping with sarcasm.  “To think you could ambush me with a mere talisman treasure! You're delusional!”</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The two talisman treasures collided.  Green and white light clashed, then scattered in all directions, dazzlingly bright.</p><p>Powerful shockwaves ripped outwards, shearing off the top of a nearby mountain.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Boulders tumbled down, the sound echoing through the heavens.</p><p>Mid-air, the green and white light battled, neither giving an inch. They seemed evenly matched, locked in a stalemate. But before long, the green light of the Jade Ruyi began to dim.</p><p>The difference lay in the two men controlling the treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation level was a full realm below Luo Xingnan's. Channeling the talisman treasure drained his spiritual power like a rushing river, and he groaned inwardly.</p><p>For Luo Xingnan, the consumption rate was also high, but significantly less than Qin Sang's.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's expression brightened. This was exactly what he had anticipated.</p><p>With his superior cultivation, he could outlast Qin Sang even in a war of attrition.</p><p>Moreover, back in the cave, he had witnessed Qin Sang use the talisman treasure to defend against the Man-Headed Serpent, and he knew its power was nearly spent. Qin Sang wouldn't be able to hold out much longer.</p><p>It was merely a desperate struggle!</p><p>However, Luo Xingnan remained vigilant.</p><p>He hadn't seen Shangguan Lifeng or Yun Youzi, especially Yun Youzi.</p><p>The scene of the Immaculate Pearl wounding the Man-Headed Serpent still sent shivers down Luo Xingnan's spine. He couldn't help but feel fortunate that he hadn't clashed directly with the old Daoist. Otherwise, he would have been the one to suffer that blow.</p><p>Although Yun Youzi seemed extremely weak, he might still have the strength for one last attack.  Who knew if it wasn't a deliberately disguised trap?</p><p>While fully controlling his talisman treasure, Luo Xingnan remained alert, his Yin-Yang Compass poised.</p><p>However, the anticipated situation never materialized, and Luo Xingnan refocused his attention on Qin Sang.</p><p>The silver knife let out a long cry, its white light growing brighter. The green light was forced to retreat, falling into a disadvantage. The Jade Ruyi trembled as if wailing.</p><p>Growing impatient, Luo Xingnan roared, “Surrender now, and I might spare your life! If you continue to resist, I'll tear you to pieces!”</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him. Then, he suddenly grunted, channeling a surge of spiritual power into the talisman treasure.</p><p>The Jade Ruyi's light flared, momentarily pushing back the silver knife.</p><p>“A last-ditch effort?”</p><p>Luo Xingnan wasn't surprised; instead, he sneered inwardly and immediately increased his spiritual power output to counter it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Jade Ruyi's light continued to intensify, showing no signs of stopping. Finally, with a *bang*, it exploded.</p><p>With little spiritual power left, Qin Sang chose to detonate the remaining power of the talisman treasure and then turned to flee.</p><p>Turbulent energy erupted. The silver knife, facing the full force of the explosion, wasn't critically damaged, but it was sent reeling by the shockwaves.</p><p>Luo Xingnan bellowed, stabilizing the silver knife and immediately launching it in pursuit.</p><p>Simultaneously, he diverted some of his spiritual power, flipping his hand and aiming the Yin-Yang Compass at Qin Sang's back. A beam of white light shot out.</p><p>With this two-pronged attack, Qin Sang seemed doomed.</p><p>At this critical moment, a sword beam suddenly flew back from within Qin Sang's body, its energy erupting, forcibly dispersing the Yin-Yang Compass's pull.</p><p>But immediately afterward, a crisp sound rang out.  The Ebony Sword was struck squarely by the silver knife and sent tumbling into the air, spinning like a headless fly before falling无力地.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed focused solely on escape, no longer able to control his flying sword.</p><p>The silver knife paused momentarily, then continued its pursuit.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang exhaust his options, with no chance of escape, Luo Xingnan was overjoyed. He flashed forward, hot on Qin Sang's heels. But just as he moved, the unexpected happened.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A bone-chilling black wind swept up from below.</p><p>Six enormous banners unfurled, forming a massive Ghost Banner Demon Formation, instantly enveloping the area.  Luo Xingnan found himself at the center of the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang had secretly laid down the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation but had kept it hidden beneath the Jade Ruyi's brilliance, using his own body to draw away the silver knife.  Only now did he activate it.</p><p>Ghostly wails pierced the air.</p><p>Startled, Luo Xingnan immediately activated the Yin-Yang Compass for protection.</p><p>He had been wary, but he hadn't expected Qin Sang to have such a terrifying technique hidden up his sleeve.</p><p>Now, he had two choices: recall his talisman treasure for protection or continue pursuing Qin Sang.  If he could kill Qin Sang, the danger would be resolved.</p><p>With remarkable composure, Luo Xingnan made his decision.</p><p>However, he underestimated the power of the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation.</p><p>Hidden within the eerie, ghostly qi were powerful wraiths that easily cracked the protective light of the Yin-Yang Compass.  Then, countless Soul Threads, impossible to defend against, swarmed Luo Xingnan, engulfing him instantly.</p><p>His Nascent Soul was scorched by the Soul Threads, sending searing pain through him.</p><p>Luo Xingnan screamed.</p><p>His spiritual power and divine sense fluctuated wildly, becoming unstable.</p><p>Without giving Luo Xingnan a chance to recover, Shangguan Lifeng, who had been lurking in the shadows, finally made his move.</p><p>From the mountains, a dazzling blade of light sliced through the air.  Shangguan Lifeng, wielding a long saber, charged into the formation, unstoppable.</p><p>Shining alongside the saber light was the Ebony Sword, which had seemingly "lost control" moments before!</p>
