<h1>Chapter 911: Double Breakthrough</h1><p>The external incarnation consolidates his cultivation.</p><p>Two days later, he slightly opened his eyes and looked at Qin Sang, who was sitting cross-legged before him.  Qin Sang had already summoned the Corpse Pill and prepared for its refinement.</p><p>Refining the Corpse Pill using the *Zong Yuan Mo Tai* technique and giving it to the external incarnation would save a lot of time. This path was untrodden even by Elder Qingzhu; Qin Sang had only one chance, and failure would destroy the pill.</p><p>For the past two years, he had mentally rehearsed this countless times.</p><p>With each increase in the external incarnation's cultivation, Qin Sang gained new insights. After countless revisions and improvements, feeling he had pushed it as far as he could, he decided to proceed without further delay.</p><p>The Corpse Pill hovered between them, imbued with the residual energy of the fierce energy, giving it a bluish-black color.</p><p>The external incarnation focused intently, running his cultivation technique.</p><p>Qin Sang simultaneously used a secret technique from the *Zong Yuan Mo Tai*, forcing out his essence blood, transforming it into streams of incantations that he sent into the Corpse Pill.</p><p>Though an external pill, the Corpse Pill had been nurtured within Qin Sang's body for decades, becoming virtually inseparable from him.  However, lacking the energy to focus on it, he'd been unable to find a way to improve it.</p><p>The *Zong Yuan Mo Tai* provided the opportunity; the refined Corpse Pill would break through the bottleneck and enhance his abilities.</p><p>However, the external incarnation's cultivation improvement through the Corpse Pill would almost certainly preclude the possibility of future advancement to the Yuan Ying stage. But that was a problem for the future; Qin Sang's own advancement to the Nascent Soul stage was still far off, so he wasn't worried about it.</p><p>This step went very smoothly. The Corpse Pill was surprisingly compliant, absorbing Qin Sang's essence blood and transforming into a blood pill.</p><p>Qin Sang's face became slightly pale from the excessive blood loss.</p><p>Immediately, the external incarnation let out a low shout, activating a secret technique, quickly emitting incantations that transformed into streams of demonic light, falling onto the Corpse Pill in an attempt to integrate with it and subdue it.</p><p>The Corpse Pill immediately began to resist violently, its energy fluctuating. The fierce energy, which had been dormant, also showed signs of instability. Qin Sang, as if expecting this, promptly intervened and suppressed it.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the Corpse Pill, not daring to relax; this was the crucial step. As long as the external incarnation could successfully complete the technique, subduing the Corpse Pill would be easy, given their shared essence.</p><p>The Corpse Pill continued to resist, but due to Qin Sang's "inside help," the secret technique eventually penetrated it.</p><p>"Absorb!"</p><p>The incarnation opened his mouth wide, and the Corpse Pill shot out like a streak of crimson light, entering his body.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang flashed to the incarnation's side, his palm lightly pressed against the incarnation's dantian, his energy surging into the incarnation's energy sea to suppress the Corpse Pill.</p><p>After a short while, Qin Sang slowly withdrew his hand, thoughtfully muttering, "The first step was successfully completed.  Next, the external incarnation and I will use blood feeding and the secret techniques from the *Zong Yuan Mo Tai* to gradually refine the fierce energy within the Corpse Pill, transforming it into his own demonic pill. This process will probably take several months. I can also start preparing to break through to the third level of the *Tian Yao Lian Xing*…"</p><p>The external incarnation sat motionless. Qin Sang glanced down, then left the cave.</p><p>One day, a year later.</p><p>Before the cave, in a clearing enclosed by a spirit formation.</p><p>A bloody glow appeared, and two figures clashed momentarily before separating. One figure stumbled back seven or eight steps, trembling slightly before regaining its footing.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his hand, his eyes narrowed slightly as he suppressed the churning energy in his body. Surprised, he mused, "The cultivation technique practiced by the external incarnation can actually affect the opponent's blood. I wonder if this is a result of prolonged blood feeding…"</p><p>These two figures were Qin Sang and his external incarnation.</p><p>At this time, the external incarnation had already refined the demonic pill and entered the Core Formation stage!</p><p>Out of caution, Qin Sang proceeded very carefully with each step, ensuring that everything was perfect before moving on.  Therefore, the entire refinement process lasted for a year.</p><p>There were two accidents during this time, but fortunately, since the Corpse Pill originally belonged to Qin Sang, he managed to resolve them successfully, finally helping the external incarnation to refine the demonic pill.</p><p>The external incarnation's strength was now that of a genuine early Core Formation cultivator.  Furthermore, because of his demonic cultivation, he could take his opponents by surprise, potentially giving them a significant disadvantage.</p><p>After testing the external incarnation's strength, Qin Sang showed a satisfied expression. He sent the incarnation back to continue solidifying its cultivation, and then busied himself.</p><p>Shortly after the external incarnation's breakthrough.</p><p>Late at night.</p><p>Qin Sang set up a large spirit gathering formation, filled with mid-grade spirit stones. Several jade bottles containing medicinal herbs for healing and rapid energy recovery were placed beside him, as well as jade boxes containing Ba Xue Fruits and Qing Wu Roots.</p><p>The star platform was set up in front of him, with the external incarnation seated opposite.</p><p>Tian Mu Butterfly, Fat Silkworm, and the Double-Headed…  were also present.</p><p>Incredibly, five Core Formation-level beings were simultaneously present in the cave.  Of course, the Fat Silkworm and Tian Mu Butterfly, while possessing extraordinary abilities, didn't have strength matching their cultivation level.</p><p>Qin Sang had cultivated the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* to the second level, only needing stellar energy to complete the process.  To increase his chances of success, he waited until his external manifestation was strong enough before attempting the breakthrough.</p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and softly said, "Let's begin!"</p><p>He then moved to the star platform and sat cross-legged. His external manifestation, the Sky-Eyed Butterflies, and other insects and beasts also moved into position, surrounding the platform, and poured their spiritual energy into it with all their might.</p><p>Qin Sang himself remained busy, multitasking. While preparing his cultivation technique, he also channeled his own spiritual energy into the star platform, enhancing the power of the starlight.</p><p>*Pfft! Pfft!*</p><p>The fat silkworm and the Sky-Eyed Butterflies were the first to exhaust their energy.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterflies folded their wings, as if asleep; the fat silkworm rolled over, lying on the ground like a dead dog.</p><p>Next, the external manifestation, its spiritual energy depleted, sat motionless.</p><p>Only Qin Sang and the two-headed…  remained.  The strongest cultivator present, actually, was the two-headed…  Qin Sang soon felt his own energy reserves dwindling. He quickly grabbed a jade bottle, poured the spirit pills into his mouth, and swallowed them all at once.</p><p>The star platform acted like a bottomless pit, absorbing all the spiritual energy without hesitation.</p><p>A faint light flickered on the surface of the platform.</p><p>The energy of the celestial stars was drawn down by the platform.</p><p>The moment the two-headed… stopped channeling their energy, a pillar of light suddenly appeared above the small island, connecting to the stars. Stellar energy poured down. Luckily, the island was remote; otherwise, someone would have noticed the strange phenomenon.</p><p>Bathed in starlight, Qin Sang hurriedly and with all his might, circulated his cultivation technique.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang felt a tremor in his heart, sensing a faint and mysterious force descending from the heavens, pouring into him from above.  With devastating power, it instantly surged into his body, mixed with obscure and dark stellar煞 (sha).</p><p>Qin Sang let out a muffled groan, his body trembling violently, a look of grim determination on his face as he struggled to maintain his composure.</p><p>His entire body was flushed crimson, his veins bulging, as if blood were seeping out.</p><p>Even worse was what was happening inside his body.  Under the impact of such a massive influx of stellar energy, his flesh felt as though it were being shredded, as if being carved away by tiny knives, while his bones felt like they were being gnawed by countless ants.</p><p>The pain he endured this time was far more terrible than when he broke through to the second level.</p>
