Chapter 620 Pretty Boy


After consuming the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, Qin Sang's foundation was healed, but his brow remained furrowed.


In the dim cave, Qin Sang looked down at his Dantian, silent for a long time.


His foundation had recovered, but his Dantian and meridians were sealed by restrictive runes. Spiritual energy couldn't enter or exit, preventing him from replenishing the missing trace of spiritual power through cultivation.


Neither consuming spirit pills nor absorbing spirit stones could break through the blockade of the restrictive runes; they were all blocked outside his Dantian.  It was like a bottle with increased capacity, but a welded-shut cap.


If he formed his Gold Core first, allowing spiritual energy to flood his body, and then broke the restrictive runes after the Gold Core had nearly taken shape to replenish the lost spiritual power, would it affect the Gold Core?


This sequence was crucial and couldn't be taken lightly.


Moreover, Qin Sang wasn't entirely sure whether the influx of spiritual energy during Core Formation would be enough to break the restrictive runes.


After several failed attempts, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, opened his Thousand Treasures Ring, and took out the jade bottle containing the Three Lights Jade Liquid.


If Yun Youzi hadn't exaggerated, the Three Lights Jade Liquid was far superior to other pills. The Soul Gathering Bowl collected the essence of heaven and earth, transforming it into this jade liquid that nourished the very essence of being, from the inside out.


It provided an extremely powerful life force, working at a fundamental level, and should be able to bypass the restrictive runes.


The Three Lights Jade Liquid was extremely precious and couldn't be replicated until he found another Soul Gathering Bowl. Qin Sang only had this small half-bottle, and he still needed to save some for the Nine Phantasmal Orchid. What remained would diminish with each drop used.


This divine medicine was meant for life-or-death situations.


Now, at the crucial juncture of Gold Core formation, it was practically a life-or-death situation. Without breaking through, there would be no future. No matter how reluctant he was, he had to try.


‘Pop!’


The bottle cap opened.


With unprecedented care, Qin Sang slowly poured out a single drop.


The green liquid radiated an exceptionally potent life force. Qin Sang took a light sniff, and his entire body felt invigorated.


At that moment, in the corner of the cave, a few blades of grass grew from the cracks in the stone. One blade, already withered, quickly straightened its stem, leaning towards the center of the cave, seemingly yearning for something.


The other blades of grass became even more vibrant and full of life.


Sensing the aura of the Three Lights Jade Liquid again, Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel.  Finally, he wrapped the drop of Three Lights Jade Liquid with his divine sense and sent it into his mouth.


‘Boom!’


The moment the jade liquid entered his body, the rich life force exploded.


“Ah…”


Qin Sang groaned, almost wanting to dance. He felt every cell in his body rejoicing, returning to its optimal state.


An unprecedented feeling of comfort spread throughout his body.


This feeling came too quickly and too intensely, intoxicating him before he could even react, making him unable to extricate himself.


Qin Sang steadied his mind and immediately examined his Dantian. To his delight, he discovered that after the Three Lights Jade Liquid entered his body, the spiritual energy within his Dantian had inexplicably increased, making up for the deficit.


His Dantian was truly full!


However, the effects of the Three Lights Jade Liquid hadn't ended yet. The powerful life force continued to circulate within Qin Sang's body.


Then, Qin Sang suddenly felt an itch in his left shoulder.


Sensing the change, Qin Sang quickly withdrew his focus from his Dantian and lifted the clothes on his left shoulder. He saw a faint green light flickering where the closed wound on his empty left shoulder had been.


This green light represented the power of the Three Lights Jade Liquid!


Seeing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred. He quickly activated his flesh regeneration technique. The inexplicable obstruction at the wound vanished, and flesh began to regenerate.


At the same time, the accumulated power of the jade liquid within him finally found its purpose, converging towards his left arm. The regeneration of his severed arm accelerated.


For cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage and above, flesh regeneration wasn't difficult.


However, before this, Qin Sang had tried various flesh regeneration techniques and consumed all sorts of healing pills, all to no avail.


Qin Sang knew that the aftereffects of the Body Severing Puppet Technique were definitely troublesome and wouldn't be resolved overnight, so he had given up. Elder Di Que, a Gold Core expert, surely had more methods than him, yet even he couldn't regenerate his limb, earning him the title 'Di Que' (Earthly Lack).


The Three Lights Jade Liquid could indeed counteract the aftereffects of the Body Severing Puppet Technique!


Qin Sang's face lit up with joy, but he wasn't too surprised. He had a premonition about this.


However, he hadn't thought of using the Three Lights Jade Liquid to heal his left arm.


He wasn't a body cultivator, and he didn't have a suitable body refining technique for the time being.  Having an incomplete limb didn't significantly affect his strength.  Missing an arm was just that, missing an arm.


A mere severed arm wasn't worth wasting a drop of the precious Three Lights Jade Liquid, so Qin Sang hadn't considered it before.


If it weren't for the restriction on his Gold Core formation, this arm might have had to wait until he encountered a life-threatening situation, forcing him to consume the Three Lights Jade Liquid, before it could recover.


The regeneration of his left arm was an unexpected bonus.


Supported by the abundant life force, the regeneration process was rapid, growing a pale white arm.


During this process, some green fluorescence drifted out. The weeds in the cave benefited, growing wildly, their stems and leaves becoming extremely thick.


Among them was a spirit herb called the Blue Elixir Fruit. It rapidly sprouted branches and leaves, almost reaching the ceiling of the cave, and finally bore dozens of fruits.


Laden with fruit, the branches bent down, hanging from above.


The Blue Elixir Fruit was considered a decent spirit fruit that could aid Qi Refinement disciples in their cultivation. Demonic beasts also enjoyed eating it. It was likely that Black Eagle had eaten it and spat the seed here.


Just then, a sudden change occurred.


The weeds withered, their life force dissipating, turning yellow and dying, including the Blue Elixir Fruit tree.


They experienced the cycle of seasons in an instant, from flourishing to decay.


Qin Sang noticed the unusual state of the weeds, his gaze fixed. He looked up at the Blue Elixir Fruit tree, reached out, plucked a fruit, and took a bite.


It was still sweet and juicy, but it had no medicinal properties, only an empty shell.


It seemed that only the spirit herbs nurtured by the immortal restrictions in the Hanging Garden of the Purple Subtlety Palace could withstand the stimulation of the Three Lights Jade Liquid and undergo transformation.


Qin Sang shook his head, cleared away the debris in the cave, raised his restored left arm, and tried to clench it.


His new arm felt a bit unfamiliar.


Although he hadn't practiced any body refining techniques, from the Qi Refinement stage to the Pseudo Core Realm, he had experienced numerous increases in cultivation, and his physical body had also benefited and improved along the way, although it was far from being as strong as a body cultivator.


His regenerated left arm was as tender as a baby's, with a noticeable difference from his right arm.


Qin Sang conjured a mirror of ice in front of him and found that the skin on his face was also unusually smooth and white. He looked no older than twenty, and he figured he'd look even younger after forming his Gold Core.


The traces of time that had been on his face before were all erased.


This was partly due to the Three Lights Jade Liquid and partly due to the restoration of his foundation.


"I've become a pretty boy," Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly.


The arm wasn't a big problem. He just needed to refine it with spiritual energy for a while, and it would be exactly the same as his right arm.  It just so happened that his divine sense still needed time to recover. He would do both things during this period.


His foundation was healed, and his severed arm was regenerated.


Everything was ready, all he needed was the right opportunity.


The gloom in Qin Sang's heart vanished completely as he once again entered a meditative state, focusing on healing.
