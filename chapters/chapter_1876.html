Chapter 1867: The Art of the Celestial Paces

The divine decree in hand pointed the way; the Divine Court lay ahead.
As far as the eye could see stretched a vast sea of clouds.
Auspicious clouds billowed, boundless in their expanse. Such a massive region of auspicious clouds was a rare sight within the depths of the Governance Platform.
However, the auspicious clouds here seemed different from those outside. The rosy glow within the clouds appeared dim, as if a layer of ash had settled upon the sea of clouds.
Not only did these auspicious clouds fail to evoke a sense of tranquility, but as the demons drew near, they felt a sense of oppression, instinctively halting their steps. An inexplicable urge prevented them from entering the cloud sea, as if some danger lurked within.
“These auspicious clouds are not what they seem; they are likely a unique illusion. Everyone, be careful…”
A Demon King’s voice echoed through a mental transmission.
According to tradition, as long as they adhered to the ancestral teachings and refrained from causing trouble, the Divine Court should pose no danger.
But it was unknown how many years the Divine Court had resided within the Governance Platform. After years of collision and fusion with the surrounding mystical illusions, it might have drastically changed, rendering the ancestral teachings unreliable.
The demons secretly braced themselves.
With the auspicious clouds ahead impassable and powerful enemies closing in from behind, the demons turned to the white-robed Demon King.
The white-robed Demon King withdrew his gaze and coldly commanded, “Stop them! Kill without mercy!”
With that, he gripped the half of the divine decree in his hand and stepped alone into the auspicious clouds.
Whether he encountered some resistance or sensed something, he stopped after flying only a few dozen feet into the clouds.
The demons outside, as well as the Daoist True Cultivators in close pursuit, could vaguely see the white-robed Demon King’s movements.
They saw his robes fluttering, his figure unmoving, as the cloud qi flowed around him.
The white robes he wore were a spirit treasure-grade robe. Now, its spiritual light flickered as it endured a constant, violent barrage, indicating that the cloud qi was not as gentle as it appeared.
The white-robed Demon King gazed ahead, a sharp glint in his eyes.  He then turned his back to the cultivators and sat cross-legged in mid-air, palms folded before his chest, the light emanating from the half of the divine decree illuminating his face.
The demons watched with a mixture of tension and anticipation, but the scene remained quiet.
The white-robed Demon King sat motionless, and neither the divine decree nor the auspicious clouds showed any change.
The demons exchanged glances. Recalling the white-robed Demon King’s command, they knew they couldn't allow anyone to disturb him at this moment.  They collected themselves, fixed their gazes on the approaching black streak of escaping light, and roared in unison.
*Whoosh!*
The Daoist faction arrived, their rainbow light revealing Daoist True Cultivators and their troops in a tight formation, the light of spirit talismans flickering on their bodies.
They had long since seen the white-robed Demon King's actions and had begun to gather their offensive from afar.  As they approached the demons, their speed increased instead of decreasing, their escaping light like a long rainbow, charging forward with earth-shattering momentum.
The demons' breath hitched, their minds shaken. In their indignation and shame, they roared even louder, their battle intent soaring.
“Roar! Roar! Roar!”
The roars were deafening, but were soon drowned out by an even greater sound.
*Rumble…*
The current that had transported the demons here reappeared.  Endless water surged, forming a thousand-foot wall of water, its terrifying power seemingly capable of destroying everything in its path.
At this moment, a powerful aura erupted from behind the demons.  Then, a massive black shadow appeared beneath them – a black-armored turtle, undoubtedly a Demon King's Dharma Image.
The Black Turtle Dharma Image was enormous, its legs like giant pillars. Silver patterns covered its black shell, appearing chaotic at first glance, yet upon closer inspection, these patterns held a profound mystique, like a wondrous map, drawing the eye irresistibly.
Its eyes resembled two bright moons, radiating brilliant light as it stared at the approaching enemies, emitting a low, rumbling growl like muffled thunder.
Drawn by the growls, the water surged forward with even greater speed, showing no signs of stopping even as it approached the demons.
*Splash!*
The demons, anticipating this, remained calm as the wave engulfed them. The Black Turtle Dharma Image then lifted them, rising from the water’s surface.
The water rippled, the Black Turtle Dharma Image transforming into a giant ship.
Unharmed, the demons unleashed their mystical powers, filling the air with a dazzling array of radiant treasures.
Clearly acting in concert, under the guidance of their Demon Kings, their disparate mystical powers seamlessly merged.
*Boom!*
The Daoist cultivators closed in, their impact force causing waves to rise from the water.
At that moment, a rich, profound light burst from the Black Turtle Dharma Image, spreading through the water.
The surrounding water turned inky black and swelled around the demons, condensing into eight black water shields that began to rotate rapidly upon forming.
Simultaneously, the demons were engulfed in the water's glow, as if donning a layer of black armor.  Their power surged, amplified by some unseen force, their mystical abilities greatly enhanced.
The remaining Demon Kings also unleashed their mystical powers and spirit treasures, supporting the Black Turtle Dharma Image.
Finally, the powerful enemy arrived!
*Boom!*
The black rainbow collided head-on with the water shields.
The eight water shields instantly solidified, visible ripples spreading outward, the residual force still possessing terrifying destructive power.
Space trembled violently. Half of the water shields shattered on the spot, while the others suffered varying degrees of damage.
Though broken, the shields successfully stopped the black rainbow.
The escaping light dispersed, revealing the Daoist faction.
Their formation was largely unchanged.  The four Grand True Cultivators, led by the old Daoist, stood upon their altars, positioned at the four cardinal points.  The remaining True Cultivators and their troops guarded their flanks, their energies seamlessly integrated.
Despite the ferocious impact, their formation only scattered slightly.  As the four Grand True Cultivators tapped their altars, a wave of azure light swept across their ranks, stabilizing their disrupted energies.
Sensing the spatial tremors, the old Daoist narrowed his eyes, his gaze passing over the demons to fix on the white-robed Demon King.
The tremors were largely caused by their clash, but some originated from within the auspicious clouds.  The white-robed Demon King had done something, and might have made a discovery.
The old Daoist had no time to ponder this, as the enemy's counterattack arrived.  The demons combined their power to conjure a giant spear, hurtling through the air towards the center of the Daoist formation.
The giant spear gradually turned black, its power intensifying.
Before the spear even arrived, the Daoist faction felt the forceful wind and their hearts trembled, their expressions changing.
"Heaven and Earth Net Talisman!"
The old Daoist roared, flicking his sleeve to produce a vermilion talisman.  He then struck it with a sword finger, causing the talisman to spontaneously combust.
The other three Grand True Cultivators, having received the command, reacted with equal speed, producing identical talismans.
*Whoosh! Whoosh!*
As the four talismans burned into nothingness, the cultivators on the battlefield felt a shift in the surrounding energy.
The True Cultivators and troops within the formation noticed silver threads appearing all around them, above, below, left, and right, omnipresent.
The threads crisscrossed, forming a dense net that enveloped all the Daoist True Cultivators and their forces.
*Whoosh!*
The giant spear hurtled towards them, descending from the sky.
The net soared upwards, its threads coiling as the entire net contracted towards the spear.
In the next instant, the spear's tip became entangled in the threads, countless more converging upon it, densely wrapping around it and engulfing half the spear in the blink of an eye.
The four Grand True Cultivators formed hand seals, the other True Cultivators and troops following their lead, constantly shifting their formation, evolving the talisman formation to aid the Grand True Cultivators in controlling the Heaven and Earth Net Talisman.
The giant spear's momentum faltered, its speed decreasing significantly.  Yet it stubbornly continued its descent, dragging the threads with it, determined to break free.
Just as the saying goes, “Strike while the iron is hot.”  Compared to its initial power, the spear's threat had greatly diminished.
The other three Grand True Cultivators released their hand seals, leaving the old Daoist to control the talisman and resist the spear alone.
Streams of light radiated from the altars beneath their feet. Without any verbal commands, the other True Cultivators and troops understood, their formation shifting accordingly.  A portion assisted the old Daoist, while the rest followed the commands of the three Grand True Cultivators.
One of the Grand True Cultivators, clad in purple robes and wearing a jade hairpin, assumed command.  Assisted by True Cultivator Ruoquan and the other Grand True Cultivator, they directed the troop movements with practiced efficiency, launching their attack.
Streams of light, mystical powers, spirit treasures, and talismans, shot from the formation like rain, showering down upon the demons.
Simultaneously, the Daoist formation advanced step by step, shielded by this barrage.
The demons’ counterattack was no less fierce. The Black Turtle Dharma Image served as an anchor, continuing to manipulate the black spear to suppress the enemy.
The remaining Demon Kings led their forces in shifting formations. Those skilled in mystical powers remained at the rear, while those with powerful physical bodies charged forward, dividing into several groups led by Demon Kings, encircling the Daoist formation and engaging in a frenzied assault.
*Splash!*
Water engulfed the battlefield, its level steadily rising as waves surged continuously.
The battlefield flashed with the light of mystical powers and magical treasures, filled with the roar of battle and flickering figures, a scene of utter chaos, making it impossible to discern which side held the advantage.
Casualties quickly mounted, blood staining the water, occasionally accompanied by severed limbs that were instantly swept away and dissolved by the waves.
The brutal carnage continued unabated.
The purple-robed True Cultivator pressed his left thumb against the nail of his ring finger, his figure moving like lightning across the altar. Each step followed a strict pattern, a technique known as the Celestial Paces.
The secrets of the Paces and the positions of the stars are the essence of the Dao, the foundation of all methods. The Celestial Paces allow one to ride upon righteous qi to control objects.  The positions of the stars govern divine intuition and transformation.  Cultivating immortality and refining the true essence, summoning and subduing – all rely upon this.
The purple-robed True Cultivator was currently employing the Thunderclap Curse-Breaking Demon-Slaying Paces.  Each step caused the formation to shift, the cultivators within becoming like his brush and ink, painting talisman diagrams, each stream of light slashing at the enemy like a sword.
The rise of the Celestial Paces began during the second Divine Firmament Convocation, when the Daoist methods of the Celestial Star Array replaced those of the Divine Court.
The Celestial Paces, also known as Stepping the Celestial Net, Pacing the罡, Treading the Dipper, and Stepping the Chronicles, was a crucial technique of the Dao.
"Dipper" refers to the Big Dipper, and "罡" originally meant the last star of the Big Dipper's handle.
Thus, this technique could also be used to commune with deities and summon ghosts, or to send memorials to the Celestial Emperor.  Unfortunately, with the fall of the Divine Court, such applications of the Celestial Paces were no longer effective.
As the purple-robed True Cultivator paced the罡, claiming the lives of demons with each step, his power surged, filling the demon cultivators with dread.
Although the Daoists were outnumbered and outmatched in individual strength, their disciplined formation, especially the elite troops of the four Grand True Cultivators, reinforced by the Celestial Paces and a constant supply of talismans, allowed them to fight as a cohesive unit, advancing and retreating with measured precision, proving a difficult target to breach.
However, every step forward came at a bloody price, met with ferocious resistance, making their advance arduous.
Amidst the chaos of the battlefield, only one person remained calm.
The white-robed Demon King sat quietly within the auspicious clouds, surrounded by swirling cloud qi, unaffected by the carnage behind him.
The light from the half of the divine decree in his hand pulsed, brightening and dimming, each surge of brightness causing tremors within the space.
The source of the tremors lay deep within the auspicious clouds.
The old Daoist kept his gaze fixed on the white-robed Demon King, sensing the changes in the half of the divine decree, a contemplative expression on his face, his lips moving slightly.
Receiving a mental transmission, the purple-robed True Cultivator's expression shifted subtly.  He issued a silent command, and the formation's forward momentum slowed, its ranks consolidating.
The old Daoist, no longer in a hurry to destroy the giant spear, stared into the depths of the auspicious clouds for a long moment, his gaze occasionally sweeping across the back of the white-robed Demon King.
The cries of battle continued, though noticeably less intense than before.
At this moment, the white-robed Demon King raised a hand and touched the divine decree.  It slowly rose, rotating above his head, and the tremors within the auspicious clouds intensified severalfold.
A sharp glint appeared in the old Daoist's eyes.  He took a step forward with his left foot, and his aura transformed.
The True Cultivators and troops within the formation instantly sensed the change, instinctively shifting their formation under the guidance of their shared energy.
The old Daoist's figure moved, performing a different Celestial Pace known as the Decree of the Water Official.
He chanted:
"By decree, I command!  Naked child, burn the heavens!
To my left, the Azure Dragon; to my right, the White Tiger. Before me, the thousand-li net; behind me, the White Yang Sword.  Summon the five dragons of the five directions, enter my waters.
Subdue the demonic evils, let none move.
As the law dictates, so shall it be!"
As the incantation ended, the sky suddenly darkened.  The old Daoist's pace quickened, his fingers forming a sword shape, pointing downwards.
Unexpectedly, no attack emanated from the Daoist formation.  The demons, initially confused, then felt something amiss in their surroundings.
The Black Turtle Dharma Image had summoned the water, and the battle had been taking place within it. Both sides had been immersed in the water.
The demon cultivators had been receiving a boost from the water, but now, that boost suddenly vanished.
Simultaneously, a roar, filled with alarm and fury, reached the ears of the cultivators.  It was the Black Turtle Dharma Image.
*Splash!*
Waves surged around them.
Within the giant waves, long, slender shadows could be seen rolling and churning.  There were five of them, nearly encircling the battlefield.
As the shadows solidified, the cultivators saw their true forms and were inwardly shocked.  They were five true dragons!
The dragons' bodies were formed from condensed water, their scales shimmering with a watery light, yet devoid of any sense of fragility.
*Splash! Splash! Splash!*
The dragons frolicked in the water, each movement sending滔天waves crashing around them.
The Black Turtle Dharma Image's expression drastically changed.  The water's energy, which he had summoned, was now partially beyond his control, as if the five water dragons had usurped his authority.
Furthermore, as the old Daoist flicked his dust whisk, the water dragons, their eyes gleaming fiercely, lunged towards the demon cultivators, claws extended.
He had turned their own water against them, bolstering his own side!
Enraged by the old Daoist's actions, the Black Turtle Dharma Image roared furiously, sending even larger waves crashing against the water dragons.
Despite this, the demon cultivators' advantage in the water had diminished significantly.  The tide had turned, and the Daoists now seemed to possess a renewed vigor.
Amidst the surging water, the battlefield was gradually inching closer to the auspicious clouds.
Just then, two Demon King Dharma Images rose into the air.
These two Demon Kings had previously remained in the rear, playing a less conspicuous role. Now, their movement immediately attracted the attention of the Daoist True Cultivators.
The old Daoist's attention was also drawn away from the white-robed Demon King, his brow furrowed as he watched the two Demon Kings.
Suddenly, everyone on the battlefield felt a tremor of fear, a sensation of their blood congealing.
In the distance, a streak of crimson flame tore across the sky.
The flames enveloped a massive boulder, like a meteorite, piercing through layers of illusions, hurtling towards the battlefield.
