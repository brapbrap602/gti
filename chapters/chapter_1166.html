<h1>Chapter 1158: Paying a Visit</h1><p>"Golden Lotus of the Fire Seed" is a secret fire-controlling technique. Elder Mu used this method to subdue the Winter's Abyss Cold Flame. After obtaining it, Qin Sang hastily condensed a wisp of Nine Nether Demonic Fire, but soon realized that his cultivation level was insufficient to continue practicing this technique. According to the description in the technique, during the cultivation process, the condensed fire seed would undergo transformations akin to a real lotus—seed, bloom, and transformation into a lotus—hence the name "Golden Lotus of the Fire Seed." Once the technique is mastered, there are additional profound changes, though the technique does not elaborate, stating only that it depends on the cultivator's destiny and fortune. For Qin Sang, these were still distant prospects.</p><p>As the "Golden Lotus of the Fire Seed" progresses, the cultivator's spiritual sense also receives a significant boost, which is the most valuable aspect of this technique. Back then, Elder Mu had not even completed the first stage, with the fire seed still in its seed form, yet his spiritual sense was already comparable to that of a great cultivator. Qin Sang had only managed to condense the rudimentary form of the seed, barely qualifying as a beginner, and thus could not yet feel this effect.</p><p>"The Nine Nether Demonic Fire within the demonic banners is more than enough to help me break through the first stage. The demonic fire is certainly sufficient; it's just a matter of whether I can control it. Although the eighteen demonic banners are precious, the technique enhances my own abilities. Even if I were to destroy all the banners, it would still be worth it." Qin Sang was clear about his priorities.</p><p>Moreover, after refining the demonic fire, it could also be used in combat. He grabbed one of the demonic banners, channeled his true essence into it, and drew out the Nine Nether Demonic Fire. Not long after, he suddenly stopped his cultivation, his brows furrowed as he stared at the demonic fire drawn from the banner.</p><p>Attempting to practice the technique again yielded results that were somewhat unexpected for Qin Sang. His cultivation had greatly improved, and his spiritual sense was far beyond what it had been during his Golden Core stage. Additionally, his soul had been continuously nourished by the Soul-Nurturing Wood for decades, resulting in a significant refinement of his spiritual sense. Yet, when he tried to cultivate the "Golden Lotus of the Fire Seed" again, he still found it extremely strenuous. Forcing the condensation of the demonic fire nearly caused the fire seed to spiral out of control, with the demonic fire rebelling against him.</p><p>Realizing this, Qin Sang immediately understood. The problem did not lie with him but with the Nine Nether Demonic Fire itself! It was likely that the rank of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire was too high, exceeding the level he could currently subdue. Even at the early Nascent Soul stage, he was still unable to control this fire. His previous success in condensing the rudimentary form of the fire seed could be attributed to the Jade Buddha. After all, the true body of the demonic fire was sealed within the banners, and only a portion of its power was being revealed. The South Ming Lihuo was no less formidable than the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Qin桑沉思良久。</p><p>For now, there were only two options.</p><p>The first was to improve his cultivation level.</p><p>Strengthening his spiritual sense might also help, but the results would be slower and the effort required would not match the gains.</p><p>The second was to follow Elder Mu's example and find another, slightly weaker spiritual fire, similar to the Winter's Abyss Cold Flame, to first master the first stage of the technique. Once the fire seed was stable and powerful enough, he could then forcibly refine the demonic fire.</p><p>Both options were far from simple.</p><p>One of his goals in cultivating the "Golden Lotus of the Fire Seed" was to control more demonic banners and rapidly enhance his combat abilities. If it were that easy to break through, why would it be so troublesome? As for spiritual fires, their power could not be too strong or too weak. From what Qin桑 knew, there were two famous spiritual fires in the Little Cold Domain.</p><p>The Ancestral Sacred Fire of the Azure Sun Demon Sect and the Earth Fire nurtured within the Mountain within a Mountain of the Void Spirit Sect. Both of these spiritual fires were already claimed. The Mountain within a Mountain was the foundation of the Void Spirit Sect. This mountain floated at the center of an underground fire vein, neither touching the sky nor the ground, and was perpetually scorched by the underground fire vein. Over time, the mountain's rocks transformed, giving birth to a peculiar Earth Fire, far more powerful than ordinary Earth Fire. However, Qin桑 had heard that the Mountain within a Mountain and the Earth Fire were essentially one entity and could not be subdued separately. The Void Spirit Sect would never agree to it.</p><p>"The Ancestral Sacred Fire..." Qin桑 recalled his experience infiltrating the Azure Sun Demon Sect to steal the Azure Sun Divine Aura. He vividly remembered the phantom of the Ancestral Sacred Fire dancing wildly atop the Divine Aura Peak, like a frenzied fire god, leaving a deep impression on him. It was said that the Ancestral Sacred Fire was left behind by the founder of the Azure Sun Demon Sect, similar in origin to the Winter's Abyss Cold Flame, both being spiritual fires cultivated by Nascent Soul ancestors. However, the Ancestral Sacred Fire had been sealed atop the Divine Aura Peak for years, absorbing countless amounts of Azure Sun Divine Aura, and could no longer be considered the original spiritual fire of the sect's founder. The aura it had displayed back then was no weaker than the Winter's Abyss Cold Flame. When the Azure Sun Demon Sect was in decline, they had once threatened to detonate the Ancestral Sacred Fire to deter covetous Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>"Back then, the Ancestral Sacred Fire was on the verge of going out of control, and the entire Azure Sun Demon Sect trembled in fear while absorbing the Azure Sun Divine Aura. I could absorb and refine the overflowing power of the Ancestral Sacred Fire from outside the seal," Qin桑's eyes gleamed. "I wonder if the new sect master has found a way to resolve the Ancestral Sacred Fire's instability... If the Azure Sun Demon Sect hadn't produced a Nascent Soul cultivator, I could have approached them with my request, and they likely wouldn't have refused."</p><p>After some thought, Qin桑 temporarily set aside the idea of paying a visit. He didn't know much about the new sect master. The Azure Sun Demon Sect was a demonic path sect, and they were not aligned with his own path. It would be unwise to visit them rashly. He would first investigate the Azure Sun Demon Sect's current situation. If they still hadn't resolved the issue with the Ancestral Sacred Fire, he wouldn't mind lending them a hand.</p><p>"During this period of calm, I might as well explore the demonic path territories, and while I'm at it, visit the Demonic Flame Sect and Mei Gu. Also, I should make a trip to the Yuan Zhao Sect to retrieve the remaining banner poles..." Qin桑 made his plans but was in no hurry to set out. He thought of the transparent lotus seed that aided his cultivation and wondered if he had underestimated it before.</p><p>Qin桑 summoned the fire seed and, following the steps of the technique, merged the demonic fire into the transparent lotus seed. The process went smoothly, and the lotus seed disappeared as the fire seed reformed. He continued to refine the demonic fire and found that the situation had improved slightly, but only marginally. Even at his limit, he still couldn't control fifteen demonic banners. Seeing this, Qin桑 gave up, deciding not to waste any more time.</p><p>He focused his energy on cultivation, spending half his time refining the "Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture" and the other half on body tempering. Both techniques progressed steadily. A month later, Qin桑 left Bai at the Yuan Shen Sect and departed alone. Passing through the Great Sui, he met with Li Yufu and the others, offering them some guidance before continuing north to the Yuan Zhao Sect, intending to pay them a visit!</p><p>He had already gathered the necessary information. Back then, the betrayal of the Wuji Sect's leader had nearly led to the annihilation of both domains. After leaving the Purple Palace, the fury of the various great powers was understandable, and they had mercilessly divided the Wuji Sect. The Wuji Sect was wiped out on the spot, and the sects affiliated with it suffered varying degrees of collateral damage. The Yuan Zhao Sect was one of them. Fortunately, they had not participated in the conspiracy, and after paying a price, they managed to survive, though they were far from their former glory.</p><p>Over the years, the Yuan Zhao Sect had regained some of its vitality, but it was still not as prosperous as it had been when Qin桑 had infiltrated it. Now, the Yuan Zhao Sect's mountain gate was located at the former site of the Kui Yin Sect. This time, Qin桑 was returning to familiar grounds.</p>
