<h1>Chapter 861 Hunting the Thunder Beast</h1><p>The Kuilong isn't a true dragon, but a mythical beast resembling one, with legs and a human-like face.</p><p>According to the young man surnamed Fang, this Kuilong only possessed a fraction of the mythical beast's bloodline, its form more akin to a Jiaolong, with a single leg on its belly.  It danced amidst the lightning, seemingly striding through the bolts.</p><p>Whenever a thunderstorm struck, this Kuilong would emerge from its lair to devour the power of the thunder.</p><p>The icy stele of the Skycold Wind Formation was refined from the essence of the Cold Pool, its complex layers generating an extreme yin energy that could effectively counter the Kuilong's powers.</p><p>“This Kuilong has been hiding so close to Skyrise Island, quite audacious. I've never heard of any major demons lurking nearby before."</p><p>Qiu Ji, with his vast network of contacts, had many friends.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang's eyes flickered.  "It's hard to say. The surrounding waters are barren.  Few cultivators come here, so perhaps no one has seen it. Besides, that beast is cunning. It only appears briefly, during the peak of the thunderstorm, to devour the lightning before quickly retreating.  It's no surprise it hasn't been discovered.  This also means we have a very limited window to hunt it..."</p><p>As they spoke, the dark clouds in the sky grew thicker.</p><p>The heavens opened, unleashing a torrential downpour.</p><p>Wind and rain howled, thunder rumbled.</p><p>Streaks of lightning illuminated the vast ocean in the stormy night.</p><p>They channeled their true essence to form protective shields, standing atop the mountain, gazing towards the Kuilong's lair.</p><p>At first, it looked no different from any other location.</p><p>But after a closer look, they noticed that the lightning strikes in that direction were more frequent and intense.</p><p>The Kuilong's lair was still hundreds of miles away, and their view wasn't clear.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang suddenly waved his hand, and the group followed him silently, flying towards the lair.</p><p>To avoid alerting the Kuilong, after leaving the island, they suppressed their auras and concealed their figures, flying almost at sea level, silently cutting through the storm.</p><p>As they neared the lair, the unusual phenomena became more pronounced.</p><p>A silhouette emerged from the distant sea—an island. Although still far away, illuminated by the lightning, they could vaguely make out the island's highest peak.</p><p>Whether due to the terrain or some other reason, the lightning in this area seemed guided by an unseen force, mostly striking the center of the island.</p><p>When they were almost at the lair, the young man surnamed Fang raised his hand to stop them.  His sharp eyes fixed on what lay ahead, he transmitted his voice, “The lightning isn't at its most intense yet. The beast shouldn’t have emerged. Prepare the spirit formation here. I’ll scout ahead and signal you…”</p><p>“Hold on, Fellow Daoist Fang. Before we slay the Kuilong, shouldn’t you deliver on your promise of treasures?”</p><p>Ma Debo stopped the young man surnamed Fang, a shrewd look on his face.</p><p>The others echoed his sentiment.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang turned, scanning the group with a smile. “Would I go back on my word? The treasures are ready.”</p><p>He produced five jade boxes and tossed them to the group.</p><p>Qin Sang caught his box.  A sweep of his divine sense revealed abundant spiritual energy within - a piece of water-attribute spirit stone, common in the Boundless Sea. This was half of the promised payment.</p><p>He silently stored the jade box in his Qianjun Ring, not bothering to check what the others received.  Some showed no emotion, others wore expressions of delight, seemingly satisfied with their rewards.</p><p>"I'll go ahead..."</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang left those words behind, his figure melting into the storm.</p><p>Watching him go, Qin Sang and the others immediately took out the icy steles and infused them with their true essence.</p><p>Under the cover of the raging storm and waves, the steles emitted a faint blue glow, growing in their hands until they were three feet tall and incredibly heavy, requiring great effort to hold.</p><p>With Chu Heng as the formation's core, the five positioned themselves. Their divine senses guided the steles, slowly forming a rudimentary spirit formation.  A swirling blue mist coalesced in their midst, gradually turning pale white.</p><p>While they prepared the formation, the young man surnamed Fang was nearing the island.</p><p>He took out a piece of red gauze, its threads shimmering like jade.  Thin as a cicada's wing, only the size of a palm, its edges showed clear signs of tearing.</p><p>This was the Red Origin Gauze, bestowed by his master for concealment.</p><p>He touched the gauze with his finger, and a red light flickered within. The gauze expanded in the wind, transforming into a thin veil.</p><p>As it did, more cracks appeared on its surface.</p><p>Pain flashed in the young man's eyes.  He muttered, "Each full activation causes irreversible damage. I can only use it twice more at most. Without it, I can't move freely in human territories. I must succeed this time."</p><p>He draped the veil over himself, his aura vanishing completely.  Then he flew onto the island, landing on a mountain peak overlooking where the lightning struck. The power was immense, but there was no sign of the beast.</p><p>"The Kuilong hasn't come out?"</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to sense something, looking up at the dark clouds. In a flash, he vanished.  Soon after, the clouds churned, and a slender shadow chased the lightning, streaking towards the island.</p><p>"Finally!"</p><p>Floating above the sea, the young man watched the shadow, a gleam of joy in his eyes.  He circled around the Kuilong, his gaze sweeping the area, searching for something.</p><p>"Only the Kuilong, the others aren't here..."</p><p>He seemed to have anticipated this, but circled again out of caution.</p><p>The Kuilong arrived above the island.  Despite its massive size, it moved with surprising agility, riding the lightning down to the spot where the strikes were concentrated.</p><p>The young man glanced back at the island, then suddenly shot towards it. At the same time, he flicked his fingers, sending two black lights into the sea.  One streaked towards Qin Sang's group, the other towards an unknown destination.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>As the young man approached, the Kuilong finally detected the unfamiliar aura and roared a warning.</p><p>In the stormy night, the Kuilong stood on the mountain peak, its single leg planted firmly. Its enormous eyes, as bright as lightning, seemed to contain swirling thunder, radiating a terrifying aura.</p><p>Undaunted, the young man removed the Red Origin Gauze. A golden light materialized in his palm – a golden rope-like magical treasure.</p><p>"Die, beast!"</p><p>He shouted, rushing forward. With a powerful swing of his arm, the golden rope erupted in light, transforming into a giant python that lashed towards the Kuilong.</p><p>The Kuilong flew into a rage.</p><p>With a boom, the mountain peak shattered beneath its foot, the ground trembling violently.</p>
