<h1>Chapter 1656: The Mani Jewel</h1><p>Above, clouds and mist formed by five elemental divine prohibitions.</p><p>Below, clouds and mist surged like a tide.</p><p>Only the central plaza seemed the most peaceful and safe place.  Except for Huashēn, no other figures were visible around, nor was there any unusual sensation.</p><p>Huashēn, his mind taut, eyes gleaming, scanned every corner.</p><p>He didn't release the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had performed a great service this time; its ability to sense treasures could also be used for warnings.  If not for it, Huashēn might have already fallen victim.</p><p>This was crucial information, absolutely not to be revealed to the enemy.</p><p>Once the enemy discerned the Fire Jade Centipede's origin, guessed the reason for the leaked location, and used some kind of isolating divine ability to seal the treasure, preventing warnings, Huashēn's situation would become extremely dangerous.</p><p>The slightest movement of grass and trees could unsettle him.</p><p>In fact, these were just normal phenomena, with no sign of the enemy. He seemed to be battling wits with thin air.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, however, was restless, its head constantly swaying; unable to pinpoint the treasure's location, it was unclear whether it was being interfered with or if the enemy was moving at high speed.</p><p>Even though Huashēn was still on the edge, he could see that the five elemental prohibitions here were magnificent and strictly enforced, far surpassing the damaged array on Huoxī Island or the collapsing protective array of Jìnghǎi Sect.  This could potentially affect the Fire Jade Centipede's perception.</p><p>If the latter was the case, the enemy's speed was already terrifyingly fast, shocking even Qin Sang.</p><p>Something's amiss!</p><p>The enemy hidden in the shadows was of unknown strength, their concealment abilities incredibly sophisticated, already having infiltrated nearby, yet Huashēn remained completely unaware.</p><p>Qin Sang was well aware that the first batch to enter Dìshòu Mountain were mostly Grand Cultivators, all with significant backgrounds, not to be underestimated. He knew too little about these people to guess which one it was.</p><p>Did the other party, seeing Huashēn's relatively low cultivation and solitary status, harbor ill intentions?</p><p>Huashēn considered this thought.</p><p>With his main body absent, he only sought self-preservation, maintaining his divine light protection while simultaneously lightly vibrating his arm, a cold light carrying a small seal flying to hover above his head.</p><p>Spiritual treasure appears, divine serpent emerges!</p><p>The four-tiered Divine Serpent Seal hung above his head, the serpent coiling and dancing around Huashēn, its cold light a fleeting shadow, like countless icy flames burning in the void, the momentum awe-inspiring.</p><p>Protected by the divine serpent, Huashēn's figure became vaguely visible.</p><p>With both the spiritual treasure and divine light protecting him, even a highly cultivated opponent would need to consider whether they could easily subdue Huashēn, and whether it was worthwhile to make a move here.</p><p>Within the five elemental divine prohibitions.</p><p>Kūn Dào silently appeared.</p><p>She stood suspended in mid-air amongst the clouds and mist, her dress fluttering lightly, ethereal and fairy-like.  There was no fluctuation of any Dao techniques or true energy about her, yet she wasn't attacked by the ubiquitous five elemental prohibitions.</p><p>Across the clouds and mist, Kūn Dào observed Huashēn, her eyes showing a strange expression upon seeing the spiritual treasure above his head.</p><p>Then, she looked towards the boundary between the clouds and mist and the outside world, the edge of the five elemental prohibitions, recalling the forced manifestation she experienced when she tried to exit the boundary earlier, and the uncomfortable feeling she'd had.  Her eyebrows furrowed, clearly showing displeasure.</p><p>She did not, or perhaps would not, bother to conceal her emotions, which were all outwardly visible.</p><p>Tilting her head, Kūn Dào seemed to be weighing the pros and cons, then suddenly faded from sight.</p><p>Simultaneously, Huashēn noticed the Fire Jade Centipede suddenly fall silent.</p><p>Within his sleeve, the Fire Jade Centipede wriggled its plump body, struggling to raise a segment of its body, swaying back and forth, its small eyes full of confusion.  But it didn't worry about such things, soon lying back down and falling asleep.</p><p>"Gone?"</p><p>Huashēn was suspicious.</p><p>Logically, since the Fire Jade Centipede hadn't been exposed, the enemy shouldn't have found the flaw so quickly, nor been able to rectify it.</p><p>It was likely that they were frightened away by the spiritual treasure.</p><p>However, Huashēn didn't dare to let down his guard.  He looked around, moving away from the highly visible plaza, finding a secluded spot in a forest, maintaining the spiritual treasure's protection and setting up layer upon layer of defenses around him.</p><p>He decided to wait and see if the enemy had truly given up, or if it was merely a feint, before considering his next course of action.</p><p>The surging mist caused the mountain winds to become increasingly fierce, rustling through the trees.</p><p>Huashēn sat cross-legged, appearing to enter a meditative state in this environment.</p><p>Soon, Huashēn no longer needed to worry; he sensed his main body rushing to meet him, so he simply waited on the spot.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body shook off his pursuers, quickly escaping the Yáng Yán divine prohibition, continuing outwards until he arrived at the edge of the clouds and mist, returning to the plaza.</p><p>As he stepped into the plaza, Qin Sang involuntarily paused.</p><p>On one of the jade steps extending from the plaza, two figures emerged from the surging clouds and mist.</p><p>Their eyes met, and both were startled.</p><p>The newcomers were none other than the Poison King and Huáiyǐn Master.</p><p>They joined forces to enter the formation, naturally finding it much easier than Qin Sang’s transformation. However, lacking guidance on the mountain, they misjudged their direction several times within the formation.  Therefore, although they entered simultaneously with the transformed being, they were slightly slower.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, the Poison King gave a cursory glance, letting out a soft exclamation before appearing instantly in the plaza, directly facing Qin Sang.  With a slight bow, the Poison King said politely, "Greetings, fellow cultivator."</p><p>Master Huaiyin followed closely, joining his hands in a respectful bow.  Unfamiliar with the Central Plains experts, he remained half a step behind the Poison King, avoiding any presumption.</p><p>Qin Sang responded with a nonchalant bow, inwardly amazed, "Two more Grand Cultivators!"</p><p>While greeting Qin Sang, the Poison King simultaneously observed the surroundings.  Seeing the clouds blocking the way above and only Qin Sang in the plaza and its vicinity, they realized they were late.</p><p>However, according to Elder Fan’s message, further guidance would be provided if necessary.  The lack of any such guidance here clearly indicated a breach of their agreement.</p><p>Their alliance, after all, was merely a temporary measure, exceedingly fragile.  The Poison King had anticipated Elder Fan's potential breach of the agreement and wasn't at all surprised.</p><p>The Poison King's thoughts raced, but their expression remained composed and courteous.</p><p>Dismissing these thoughts, the Poison King showed curiosity towards Qin Sang, "Fellow cultivator, you seem unfamiliar?"</p><p>Qin Sang twitched the corner of their mouth, speaking in a flat tone,  "The Poison King's reputation precedes them.  It's understandable that someone insignificant like myself wouldn't catch your eye."</p><p>Seeing the exquisite features of the face before them, rivaling any beauty in the world, Qin Sang was quite surprised to encounter the Poison King so unexpectedly.</p><p>Legends say the Poison King was stunningly beautiful, their gender ambiguous.  The rumors proved true.</p><p>The Poison King’s gender had long been a topic of much discussion in the cultivation world.</p><p>This individual, the esteemed master of Wan Du Mountain, was not in Jin Yu Prefecture, indicating they had followed the Scarface Man.</p><p>Considering the much-coveted Jade Armored Insect slumbering in their dantian, Qin Sang felt a slight hesitation, silently observing the monk.</p><p>The monk was powerfully built, possessing an exceptionally vibrant life force rarely seen.</p><p>Qin Sang, also a cultivator of physical cultivation, recognized the monk's mastery of a top-tier body refinement technique, surpassing even their own skill.</p><p>They marveled at this, knowing the renowned Buddhist monks of the Central Plains, yet unable to identify this one.</p><p>"Mere reputation, a source of amusement," the Poison King said.</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's thoughts, the Poison King, seeing Qin Sang's indifferent attitude, refrained from further questioning and introduced their companion, "This is Master Huaiyin, a holy monk from the Western Lands. We are traveling together in Nan Zhou, and witnessing this celestial phenomenon. We're still very puzzled by many things and wish to ask you some questions, fellow cultivator."</p><p>*From the Western Lands… have they met the Ghost Mother?* thought Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly to the monk, lazily stating, "Wan Du Mountain dominates Man Zhou.  Shouldn't the esteemed Poison King know where we are?"</p><p>"We only guessed it was the remains of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect's estate…" The Poison King hadn't finished when Qin Sang interrupted.</p><p>"That's enough! What else could bring you here but treasure hunting?  I know no more than you. I can't answer your questions," Qin Sang spread their hands, making a move to leave.</p><p>The Poison King furrowed their brows, revealing a strange allure.</p><p>If Qin Sang's cultivation was weaker, the Poison King wouldn't mind subduing them. However, with enemies of unknown location, offending a Grand Cultivator would be unwise.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang about to depart, the Poison King's mind raced.  They quickly said, "Forgive my boldness, but I wish to inquire about someone… this person…"</p><p>The Poison King then channeled their true energy to conjure a water mirror, displaying the image of a man with a face scarred with centipede-like welts.</p><p>*As expected.*</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged as they casually glanced at the mirror, coldly scoffing, "Dare you claim ignorance? This person is one of the masterminds behind opening the estate!"</p><p>"To be frank, we truly didn't know," the Poison King frankly shook their head. Seeing Qin Sang didn't understand, they directly asked if Qin Sang had seen this person in the mountains, offering a reward for information.</p><p>Qin Sang shook their head and left.</p><p>The Poison King sighed, unsure whether Qin Sang genuinely didn't know or hadn't seen the man.  Exchanging a glance with Master Huaiyin, they examined the Five Elements Divine Prohibition.</p><p>Qin Sang left the plaza, maintaining distance, ensuring no pursuit before vanishing into the forest.</p><p>The Poison King's quick appearance was unexpected.</p><p>Deep down, Qin Sang was unwilling to return the Jade Armored Insect.</p><p>Such a unique insect existed nowhere else in the world.</p><p>They preferred to subdue it themselves or let the Poison Pearl devour it.  Improving the Antidote Armor was secondary; Qin Sang eagerly anticipated what changes the Poison Pearl might undergo by consuming this unparalleled vicious insect.</p><p>Section</p><p>Mastering the jade beetle's poisonous light would also allow cultivation of the Heavenly Annihilation Soul-Shattering Needle, essentially gaining two powerful poison-type techniques simultaneously.</p><p>"We'll play it by ear!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>He had used a disguise when visiting the Seven Fragrances Pavilion, so there shouldn't be any flaws.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang concealed his presence and quietly approached his avatar's hiding place.</p><p>Through their connection, he already knew what had happened to his avatar.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang appeared beside his avatar.</p><p>Section</p><p>Under the Celestial Eye, everything was clear.  No enemies were hidden nearby.</p><p>"Who could it be?"</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.  It couldn't have been Su Zinan or the Poison King's group.  Zhu Wudao was being watched by two masters from the Eight Scenic Views sect, so the most likely suspect was Old Devil Fan.</p><p>The demonic arts are unpredictable, and Old Devil Fan's actions seem to fit the profile.</p><p>Or perhaps, some other unknown expert has entered the mountain.</p><p>Unable to figure it out, Qin Sang stopped thinking about it, sat down, and took the lotus pedestal from his avatar.  The avatar then removed its defenses and flew to a high place to observe the changes in the Five Elements Divine Restriction, paying particular attention to the Metal element restriction.  Old Devil Zhu holds the Metal Phase Order; the Metal element restriction is the most likely to change.</p><p>Section</p><p>Before acting, Qin Sang wanted to examine his new treasure's secrets.</p><p>He held the lotus pedestal in one hand and the Wish-Fulfilling Orb in the other.</p><p>The recess in the lotus pedestal was perfectly sized for the Wish-Fulfilling Orb – what a coincidence!</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, remembering the relationship between the Jinghai Sect, Xiao Xiangzi, and the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.  He moved his hands towards each other, slightly turning the lotus pedestal so the recess faced the Wish-Fulfilling Orb.</p><p>At this moment, he had a feeling that the two treasures were mutually attracted.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat.  Just as he was about to join them, he suddenly remembered something and sent his spiritual sense into his Qianjun Ring. Several beams of light flew out, forming a flag formation to seal off the surroundings and prevent any strange phenomena from being noticed by outsiders.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang pressed the Wish-Fulfilling Orb onto the lotus pedestal!</p><p>Section</p><p>'Click!'</p><p>A crisp sound echoed as the Wish-Fulfilling Orb fit perfectly into the lotus pedestal.</p><p>The orb was precisely half above and half below.</p><p>Perfectly integrated!</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently, noticing that at the moment of insertion, the circle of red flames inside the lotus pedestal seemed to swell slightly before returning to normal, surrounding the Wish-Fulfilling Orb and making its luster even more profound.</p><p>No other unusual phenomena occurred.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then sent a strand of spiritual sense into it.  He unexpectedly perceived that the name of the Wish-Fulfilling Orb had changed; a new name appeared in his mind – Mani Jewel!</p><p>Section</p><p>Clearly, this was its true name.  The name "Wish-Fulfilling Orb" was probably inscribed later by someone after the treasure was split.</p><p>Mani Jewel. Qin Sang had read about it in Buddhist scriptures. Some scriptures described the Mani Jewel as a Buddha's treasure with extraordinary powers.</p><p>However, many Buddhist cultivators who refined treasures liked to name them from Buddhist scriptures, often stretching the meaning, making it impossible to judge the treasure's origin from its name alone.</p><p>After being restored, was it still a defensive treasure?</p><p>Qin Sang carefully sensed it and was even more surprised.</p><p>Before, Qin Sang couldn't determine the Wish-Fulfilling Orb's grade.</p><p>Now, not only could he not determine the Mani Jewel's grade, he wasn't even sure if it was a magical treasure at all. This treasure greatly defied his understanding.</p><p>Section</p><p>He even thought of it as a magical artifact, and it made sense.</p><p>It sounded absurd, but there are always unusual things in the cultivation world, and special artifacts are not uncommon. However, Qin Sang dared not make a judgment about the Mani Jewel.</p><p>"It seems my skills in the art of refining are still too shallow."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, infused it with true energy, and tried to control the Mani Jewel using the same method as the Wish-Fulfilling Orb.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>Golden light erupted around Qin Sang.</p><p>The familiar protective barrier appeared.</p><p>Section</p><p>The protective ability was still there, seeming a little thicker, but it was no different from the Wish-Fulfilling Orb.  Could the fully restored Mani Jewel have no other powers?</p><p>Qin Sang wondered, examining it for a while. He looked at the seemingly illusory flames in the center of the Mani Jewel, remembering it originated from the Fire Phase Hall, and a sudden thought struck him.</p><p>Unconsciously, Qin Sang summoned the Fire Seed Golden Lotus and channeled a wisp of demonic fire into the Mani Jewel.</p><p>A strange scene unfolded.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire flowed into the Mani Jewel without any hindrance.</p><p>A cluster of black flames appeared in the middle of the crystal-clear Mani Jewel, turning it black.  Then the red flames on the lotus pedestal flickered, emitting a strange ripple, while the golden light of Qin Sang's protective barrier suddenly dimmed, unknowingly incorporating a layer of black flames.</p><p>In an instant, the protective barrier transformed into a protective fire barrier!</p><p>Section</p><p>Qin Sang did not feel the familiar ferocity of the demonic fire from the protective fire barrier, but rather a sense of weightiness. He quickly channeled more demonic fire from the Fire Lotus into it, all of which the Mani Jewel absorbed.</p><p>The more demonic fire, the thicker and stronger the protective fire barrier became.</p><p>Qin Sang used a strand of his spiritual sense to control the Golden Sinking Sword to attack himself. He found that although the protective fire barrier only had a simple protective function, it was far superior to the Wish-Fulfilling Orb; the more demonic fire infused, the stronger it became!</p>
