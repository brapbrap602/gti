Chapter 612: The Corpse with the Severed Arm


The Western Frontier, a savage land.
Treacherous mountains and rivers, cliffs and precipices abound, miasma is frequent, and fierce beasts and venomous insects dwell together.
Even the occasional winding mountain path is fraught with peril.
However, despite its dangers, the Western Frontier possesses a unique and eerie beauty, with bizarre peaks and rocks, waterfalls and springs, and layer upon layer of mountains, presenting a myriad of breathtaking scenes.
This place is not devoid of human presence.
On the contrary, the Western Frontier has a considerable population of indigenous people, whose ancestors have lived here for generations.  They mostly live in fortified settlements, skilled in martial arts and insect control, eking out a living in this harsh environment.
‘Splash…’
A small river flows between the cliffs, its surface narrow but swift. The water splashes against the rocks on the riverbank, sending up sprays of white foam.
Like most rivers in the Western Frontier, this river's course is exceptionally winding.
Obstructed by rocks and cliffs, small whirlpools form where the water is blocked, trapping a growing mass of twigs, weeds, and leaves.
In some places, thick, scarred logs lie across the riverbed, evidently fallen and broken trees that have tumbled down from the mountains.
However, there's no need to worry about them rotting in the river.
Rain is frequent in the Western Frontier, with heavy downpours every few days that wash the mountains clean.  After the rain, the river swells, sweeping away all the debris.
As the saying goes, the chirping of cicadas makes the forest seem quieter, the singing of birds makes the mountains seem more secluded.
Here, the rushing river and the noisy birds and beasts on both banks make the place seem even more tranquil.
Especially now, in the early morning, after a light drizzle, with fine rain still falling, the water vapor gathers into a thin mist, shrouding the mountain peaks, creating a scene reminiscent of a fairyland.
‘Whoosh…’
Suddenly, a sharp whistling sound comes from downstream.
The mist stirs, and a distant golden light can be seen breaking through the fog, moving upstream at great speed.
Abruptly, the golden light stops mid-air, revealing a middle-aged man in strange robes.
The man is tall and sturdy, hovering in the air, with a golden light circling him, faintly resembling a sword.
He has a rugged appearance, with intricate patterns on his face and three claw marks, from an unknown creature, extending from the corner of one eye to the corner of his mouth.
The claw marks have a deathly gray hue, as if residual poison lingers, making the man appear even more ferocious.
His robes are uniquely styled, sewn together from irregular pieces of animal hide, forming a bizarre pattern in vibrant colors.
His neck, wrists, and even his face are covered in strange patterns tattooed with unknown pigments, and he wears many ornaments made of bones, animal teeth, and strange insects.
If any of the local villagers were to pass by and see the items on this man, they would immediately kneel down and prostrate themselves, calling him a Bimo, Priest, or Shaman’s Envoy, or something similar.
The hides, teeth, and bones adorning him are all taken from the most ferocious venomous insects and beasts, creatures that the villagers of the Western Frontier fear the most.
Only the legendary Shaman’s Envoys, or the Bimo and Priests of the large settlements, are said to be capable of hunting them.
However, from the perspective of a cultivator from the Small Cold Region, this man is a fellow cultivator, although his attire is extremely peculiar and rarely seen in the Small Cold Region. His cultivation level is not particularly high, only at the tenth level of Qi Refining.
The man in animal hide robes hovers in the air, his gaze sharp as a hawk, staring down at the river below, where a sharp bend has formed, and the surface is covered with a thick layer of broken branches and leaves.
Among the debris, a pale arm protrudes.
The villagers of the Western Frontier are martial, and conflicts often erupt between settlements over resources.  It's not uncommon to find corpses in the river, so the man in animal hide robes initially didn't pay much attention.
However, a quick glance revealed some unusual details that caught his eye, prompting him to stop.
The man flashes down to the riverbank, extends his hand toward the center of the river, and with a surge of spiritual energy, effortlessly lifts the corpse out of the water.
‘Splash!’
As the corpse is pulled out, the whirlpool is disturbed, and the accumulated debris scatters. Some are carried away by the current, but more flow down from upstream, including several logs as thick as a man's thigh.
‘Thud!’
The corpse lands on the bank, face up, revealing a rather delicate face. It's a young man who appears to be in his early twenties.
His skin is completely devoid of color, indicating he's been in the water for a long time.
His eyes are closed, he has no breath, and he is clearly dead. His left arm is severed at the shoulder, and it's unclear whether the blood has drained completely or been stopped by some method.
It's a corpse with a severed arm.
“A Shaman’s Envoy indeed!”
The man in animal hide robes is delighted, his eyes gleaming with greed. He didn't expect to stumble upon such a windfall.
“This robe should be quite good! What a pity!”
He examines the tattered robe on the corpse, sensing its fine material, but it's riddled with holes and tears, seemingly unusable.
Despite its condition, the robe still provided some protection in the turbulent river.
“Floating down from upstream… could it be from the Crescent Moon Settlement?  Has there been another internal conflict?”
The man glances upstream, frowning slightly.  His divine sense sweeps over the corpse, including the rusty iron ring on its finger, but finds nothing unusual.
Finally, his gaze fixes on two pouches at the corpse's waist.
“What kind of pouches are these? They look so strange. Which one is the storage pouch?”
He mutters to himself.  He has encountered priests from large settlements and Shaman’s Envoys from outside, and he knows that human cultivators commonly use a type of storage device called a storage pouch, which is more convenient than the ones used by his own people.
Later, influenced by humans, many Shaman’s Envoys from his own kind have adopted human practices, for example, the title "Shaman’s Envoy" is no longer used outside, and they are now called cultivators or immortals.
Only in remote places like the Western Frontier are some of the old traditions still maintained.
The pouches on the corpse don't look like storage pouches.
“Are they for storing Gu insects? Or… has he been robbed?”
The man’s expression darkens, the smile vanishing from his face. He reaches out and grabs one of the pouches, his divine sense probes inside, encountering a divine soul imprint, and easily opens the pouch.
“Buzz…”
The next moment, a sharp buzzing sound fills the river valley.
A massive cloud of blood bursts out of the pouch.  The man in animal hide robes sees the swarm of grotesque, blood-winged bees within the cloud and freezes, his face whiter than the corpse on the ground.
He cries out in terror, and a green light shoots out from his dantian.
It's a jade mantis, the size of a finger, brandishing its blades.
Facing the ferocious blood cloud, the jade mantis appears fragile and weak. It’s instantly engulfed, not even a bone remaining.
The man barely manages to summon his golden sword before the blood cloud engulfs him.
“Ah!”
A shrill scream echoes through the mountains, startling the birds and beasts.
