<h1>Chapter 802 The Demonic Seed</h1><p>Bao Gu Mountain. Qin Sang remained in his cave dwelling for several days, without venturing out.</p><p>One of the greatest difficulties in cultivating the *Seed of the Yuan Demon* is refining the demonic seed. Qin Sang, possessing a sword soul, found the process considerably easier by using it to nurture the seed.</p><p>However, this demonic art remains obscure and difficult to understand.  First, Qin Sang needed to capture the existence of the divided soul within the sword light.</p><p>The fusion of sword light and a divided soul was unheard of in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally planned to proceed slowly, but he discovered that his swordsmanship was subtly improving during the process of perception. He decided to enter seclusion, simultaneously cultivating both his swordsmanship and the demonic technique.</p><p>More than ten days passed unnoticed.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>The ebony sword floated before him.</p><p>Two beams of sword light flanked it.</p><p>His eyes were fixed on the sword light imbued with the technique. Following Elder Qingzhu's message and his own understanding of sword light division, after days of exploration, he finally perceived the difference in this sword light.</p><p>This beam of light was exceptionally stable, and the connection with its master was far stronger.</p><p>"Shatter!"</p><p>After a moment's contemplation, Qin Sang formed a hand seal and softly uttered a word.</p><p>With a 'snap', the sword light, like glass, was crisscrossed with cracks and shattered into countless fragments.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly clutched his head, letting out a pained groan.</p><p>The shattering of his sword soul caused a piercing pain, though far less intense than described in the original *Seed of the Yuan Demon*.  Qin Sang could endure it.</p><p>Quickly, he adjusted to the pain, raised his head, opened his bloodshot eyes, gritted his teeth, and focused completely on completing the demonic technique.</p><p>As Qin Sang moved, the fragments of his sword soul began to merge.</p><p>Gradually, it was as if a drop of ink spread from the center of the sword soul, eventually staining it entirely black.</p><p>The sword soul vanished, replaced by a demonic seed, like a black droplet. Although not entirely cultivated through demonic means, it emanated a strong aura of evil.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it for a while, then withdrew the demonic seed into his primordial spirit space to await its development.  He then opened the insect container.</p><p>The fat silkworm had awakened during the demonic seed refinement, disturbed by the movement from the container.</p><p>After swallowing the poisonous mist, the fat silkworm had slept soundly. Upon waking, besides a slightly stronger aura, there were no other noticeable changes.</p><p>Qin Sang was used to this and wasn't surprised. Even with only its poison resistance ability, the fat silkworm was useful. Continued growth might grant it immunity to all poisons in the world.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang took out a piece of purple crystal from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>At the sight of the purple crystal, the fat silkworm's small eyes gleamed with avarice. It seemed to never know satiety, pushing and shoving against Qin Sang's palm, demanding the treat.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't tease it, bringing the crystal close. The fat silkworm broke through its self-constructed barrier, biting into the crystal with a sharp 'crunch', breaking off a small piece.</p><p>The fat silkworm's blunt approach startled Qin Sang, who anxiously observed its condition.</p><p>The fat silkworm's throat pulsed, swallowing the entire crystal before succumbing to sleepiness and falling asleep.</p><p>"A small piece at a time is enough.  It's sleeping so soundly, it won't wake up for a while.  It seems these crystals will last a long time…"</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The fat silkworm was a picky eater, and finding its preferred food was difficult. He had searched through the remains of the hooked-nose man for a long time without finding the origin of the poisonous smoke.</p><p>Then, he summoned the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, feeding it spirit herbs in hopes of a quick breakthrough.</p><p>After feeding the fat silkworm and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, Qin Sang cultivated his swordsmanship for a while before leaving the cave and heading down the mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>He changed his appearance, first buying a commoner's house at the foot of Bao Gu Mountain as a base.</p><p>Then he went to the market alone.</p><p>Tianxing City's market was vast, with numerous cultivators from within and outside the city conducting transactions daily. It was considered the most prosperous place in the Canglang Sea cultivation world.</p><p>"Linglong Pavilion…"</p><p>After circling the market, Qin Sang arrived in front of a small shop.</p><p>The name was delicate, but the shop was unremarkable, similar to others, selling talismans, magic tools, and pills—common items in the cultivation world.</p><p>At the moment, there were no customers.</p><p>Linglong Pavilion was where Madam Liu and he had agreed to meet. After observing from outside, Qin Sang stepped inside.</p><p>The shop owner was a white-haired old man, only at the Foundation Establishment stage. At his age, he was obviously unable to reach the Golden Core stage. Seeing Qin Sang enter, he was about to rise to greet him when he heard a bell chime, his expression subtly changing.</p><p>The shopkeeper glanced at Qin Sang's sleeve, immediately leading him to the back room.</p><p>"May I ask who you are, senior?"</p><p>The shopkeeper cautiously inquired.</p><p>"Master Qingfeng, Madam Liu should have mentioned me, right?"</p><p>Qin Sang showed her bright eyes. "Madam Liu told me to find the Linglong Pavilion in Tianxing City.  If there's confidential business, we'll communicate through the Pavilion. Did she mention this to you?"</p><p>The shopkeeper nodded eagerly. "The master just gave instructions. I've been waiting for your arrival… Forgive my poor eyesight, I mistook you for a monk and didn't recognize you."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded unconcernedly and got straight to the point. "I've rented a small courtyard in the city. Here's the address. There's a restriction I've placed within. Tell Madam Liu to go directly to the courtyard to contact me…"</p><p>After leaving the address, Qin Sang didn't waste words and departed.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang resumed his true appearance and strolled through the market.</p><p>He bought some cultivation supplies from several shops and casually inquired about Spirit Turtle Island.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Spirit Turtle Island wasn't well-known.  Senior Qingzhu was indeed very low-key.  After asking around, Qin Sang found that nobody knew the island master's name.</p><p>Only one person said that their hometown had a small island called Spirit Turtle Island, but it was inhabited by ordinary people, the spiritual energy was thin, it was impossible for cultivators to live there, and there was no island master.</p><p>Once you leave that sea area, no one knows about the existence of this small island.</p><p>There are countless islands in the Canglang Sea; it's not unusual for there to be duplicates.</p><p>Qin Sang walked and stopped, spending the whole day browsing the market, finally arriving at a place called the Xiang'an Auction House. It sounded unassuming, suggesting a secluded place seeking only peace and tranquility.</p><p>However, this auction house was jointly built by the three major trading alliances, the largest in Tianxing City.</p><p>Upon entering the auction house, with his cultivation level, he naturally wouldn't be looked down upon, and he received a warm welcome.</p><p>After being led into a private room by a servant, Qin Sang handed her a jade slip.</p><p>"I want to purchase a spiritual fruit, but I don't know its name. The jade slip contains pictures of the fruit and plant…"</p><p>After browsing around, he hadn't found out what kind of spiritual fruit he'd obtained from the Qisha Hall, so he came to the auction house, making up a reason to purchase the fruit.</p><p>The auction house employs renowned grand alchemists; they are arguably the most knowledgeable people. If even they didn't recognize it, Qin Sang figured his chances elsewhere would be slim.</p><p>"Please wait a moment, sir…"</p><p>After examining the jade slip, the attendant bowed and left.</p><p>Shortly after, an alchemist entered the room.</p>
