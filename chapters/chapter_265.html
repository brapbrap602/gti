Chapter 258: Stone Palace

Elder Dique was convinced that he had died, and so would not go to Mount Shaohua to spread rumors.

As long as he could leave the Ancient Ruins, he could escape to another place before Elder Dique noticed.

On the way, he could spread the news of Elder Dique's plot against Grandmaster Xuanyu, setting a trap for him and forcing him to ignore Qin Sang for the time being.

Getting out of the control of Elder Dique would only ensure his safety temporarily. The problem facing Qin Sang now was how to get out of the ancient ruins.

He had carefully memorized the methods to break the restrictions on the mountain path.

However, his powers were insufficient. Knowing the method did not mean that he could succeed. He might very well be trapped to death on the mountain.

Should he stay here to cultivate?

Qin Sang moved quietly to the cliff and touched the scorching rock face. The spiritual energy in the volcano was very abundant. It was not impossible to open up a cave here. He had already comprehended the second Death Talisman. Before he reached the middle stage of Foundation Establishment, he could just go into closed-door cultivation.

Within twenty years, he would always find an opportunity to escape.

After some deliberation, Qin Sang looked up and saw Elder Dique good at the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody. The firebirds were not a problem for him. He should find a place to hide.

However, if he were hiding in the group of firebirds, Elder Dique would not be able to use his spiritual energy and divine sense to search everywhere, so there was no need to worry about being discovered.

Thinking of this, Qin Sang bent down slightly. His line of sight was not very far. The entire belly of the volcano was full of firebirds. There were many more than the flying monkeys on the magma lake. It was simply a huge firebird's nest.

With so many firebirds guarding it, the treasure must be more precious than Red Gold Vine, right?

After hesitating for a while, curiosity prevailed. Qin Sang began to descend slowly.

The volcano was bottomless.

Along the way, Qin Sang did not see any restrictions.

He did not know how far down he had descended, but he still did not see the bottom. Here, the Fire Element power was extremely strong, making it hard to bear the heat. He changed into a robe made of Polar Bird's feathers. The robe was surrounded by cold air to protect his body and could resist the fire. Now, even the feathers on the robe were starting to curl.

He should be close to the magma, Qin Sang thought to himself as he looked at the increasingly dense group of firebirds.

The surroundings were一片赤红一片赤红, and firebirds were everywhere. Qin Sang moved more carefully, hiding among the firebirds and avoiding collisions so as not to be discovered by the firebirds.

Although Qin Sang could go invisible at any time, evade the firebirds, and escape the battle, Grandmaster Xuanyu was most likely at the bottom. Even if he could not release his divine sense to sense him, once the firebirds became abnormally chaotic, it would definitely arouse his alertness.

Suddenly, Qin Sang's figure paused.

At this time, he was almost close to the edge of the mountain belly. Unexpectedly, he saw a stream of magma hitting the rock wall under his feet. Then, it slowly flowed down. The rock wall had obviously been tempered for thousands of years and was unscathed.

Moreover, amidst the endless chirping of birds, Qin Sang could faintly hear the sound of magma rolling.

He had finally reached the bottom, but there was no ancient immortal cave as he had imagined.

Qin Sang stared at his feet in surprise. Not long after, another large wave of magma hit him.

Here... there was actually no禁制 sealing the magma river?

Qin Sang was greatly surprised. Ever since he had entered the ancient immortal ruins, whether it was in the trial space or in the cave, the surging magma had been firmly sealed below by that round restriction.

No matter how powerful the giant wave was, it could not shake the restriction in the slightest.

Qin Sang suspected that this restriction was very likely a part of the grand formation of the ancient immortal ruins. The restriction isolated the ancient immortal ruins from the outside world, and the magma below did not belong to the ruins.

Was there no restriction here, or was the restriction special and hidden below? Qin Sang thought to himself. If he jumped into the magma river, would he be able to get out directly?

The premise was that he would not be swallowed by the magma due to the exhaustion of spiritual energy before he could find the exit.

He did not act rashly but mixed into the firebirds and moved slowly along the edge of the mountain belly in search of a way out.

Very soon, Qin Sang made a discovery. Not far away, he found the familiar round restriction, or rather, some fragments of the restriction.

These fragments of the restriction were laid out intermittently. There were various-sized cracks everywhere. In many places, a large piece was missing. If the magma wave was large enough, it could rush out of the gap.

There were restrictions here, but they had been destroyed!

Qin Sang moved cautiously and patiently walked around the wide mountain belly. This was a magma lake even wider than the cave. It took Qin Sang a long time to walk around it.

Uncertainty’s of time or other reasons, the restriction of the mountain cave has been worn away over the years, thus the restriction in the entire cave was fragmented. Other than that, there were no other discoveries. The stone walls of the cave were seamless from one another, there were no holes or secret rooms.

Where is the immortal cave dwelling?

Doubt filled Qin Sang’s mind. His eyes moved and he gazed at the center of the crater. After a moment of contemplation, he silently snuck over.

Meanwhile.

Mountaintop.

Ren Hong glared at Old Man Dique with bone-chilling hatred. Only a raspy “hehe” sound could be heard from his throat, expressing the most venomous of curses.

But it is destined to be futile and powerless.

Until the light in his eyes faded away, Ren Hong still could not close his eyes in peace.

Old Man Dique’s expression did not change. He gently shook the Celestial Melody Conch, a divine sound energy turned Ren Hong’s body into ashes. It was as easy as killing an ant. He retracted his gaze indifferently, looking towards the Firebird flock.

Following that, Old Man Dique took the Celestial Melody Conch into his body, a stream of divine sound energy emerged from his body.

Flames of feathers were the first to take shape, Following that, his body began to change before finally turning into a Firebird. He flapped his wings gently and flew into the crater.

Abruptly, the “Firebird’s” body froze upon being met with a chaotic clamor of bird cries. The feathers on its body fluttered for a while before swiftly returning to normal. After a moment of frolicking together with the real Firebirds, a glimmer of intelligence flashed within its eyes before it swiftly flew towards the bottom of the volcano.

…

A large stone platform hovered at the center of the volcano’s stomach.

The circular restriction beneath the stone platform was even more severely damaged, almost nothing remained, and magma was completely exposed. Huge waves of magma crashed against the stone platform.

On the circular stone platform, an ancient stone temple occupied almost the entirety of the space, leaving almost no room to stand.

The stone temple was overly simplistic. It was clearly constructed from tens of long strips of stones and the presumed entrance was crudely sealed by a massive square piece of blue stone.

Moreover, these stone strips were unusually rough, cracks and chips could be seen everywhere.

The stone temple was on the verge of collapse. It seemed as though it would crumble apart with but a gentle push.

Even mortals would not dwell in such a house!

However, layers upon layers of restrictions flickered with an aquamarine light that formed a stark contrast against the crimson magma below. In this setting, it appeared unique and mysterious.

Surrounding the stone temple was an empty hemispherical space. The Firebirds could only fly around the outside, unable to enter this space.
