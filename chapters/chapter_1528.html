<h1>Chapter 1519: Sanctuary</h1><p>The Horn of Heaven.</p><p>The place where Master Tian Yue erected his sword.</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the sword, gazing at the storm belt. He turned to Tan Hao beside him and said, "The demon race has lost many of their powerful warriors. I estimate they won't dare to stir up trouble outside the Demon Realm anytime soon. You should find an island nearby to consolidate your cultivation. I'll go in first to search for the sanctuary."</p><p>After Tan Hao's successful breakthrough, he adjusted his breathing briefly and then eagerly followed Qin Sang here.</p><p>They detoured north of the Crescent Moon Realm, following the Star Sand Archipelago to the Horn of Heaven.</p><p>Along the way, they didn't encounter a single squad of demon soldiers, a stark contrast to the situation when Qin Sang last came here.</p><p>During their journey, Qin Sang, using his true identity, visited several fellow Daoists he had known before and received a warm welcome.</p><p>Especially the cultivators of the Star Sand Archipelago, who had been oppressed by the demon race, were extremely grateful to Qin Sang.</p><p>"I still find it hard to believe that in just a few short years since we parted, Brother Qin has accomplished such a great feat..."</p><p>Tan Hao shook his head with a wry smile.</p><p>When he learned the truth, it was hard to describe the shock to his mind. He was stunned for a long while, the excitement and pride of his successful breakthrough vanishing without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, summoned the Ten Directions Earth-Cleaving Divine Shuttle, transformed into a streak of azure light, and entered the storm belt.</p><p>This treasure was indeed extraordinary. The rate at which Qin Sang's True Essence was consumed was much slower than last time.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged inside the divine shuttle, no matter how fierce the storms outside were, his body remained as steady as a rock.</p><p>If he had had the divine shuttle last time, he wouldn't have been chased by Bi Fang for ten thousand miles.</p><p>Guided by the Moongazing Rhinoceros Horn, Qin Sang piloted the divine shuttle, weaving through the storms, taking turns with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to observe their surroundings.</p><p>Logically, the first sanctuary after leaving the Horn of Heaven should not be difficult to find.</p><p>Unexpectedly, despite having so many treasures to support him and having browsed through the ancient texts treasured by the Profound Heaven Palace, Qin Sang searched for a long time without any success.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that this sanctuary might have been deliberately destroyed or sealed by Master Tian Yue.</p><p>However, Master Tian Yue's purpose was to protect the North Barrens Realm and prevent the cultivators of the North Sea from becoming too powerful and invading on a large scale. He shouldn't have cut off the path of his homeland.</p><p>Therefore, he took Tan Hao back to the North Barrens Realm. Instead of rushing back to the Green Goat Temple, he visited Lu Boyuan to gather information, cross-referencing the ancient texts of both realms.</p><p>Then, he delved deeper into the search, going back and forth countless times. Relying on the Moongazing Rhinoceros Horn and the divine shuttle, he finally made a discovery!</p><p>It was unknown how many sanctuaries there originally were on the ancient path. Qin Sang only found one.</p><p>A stone palace floating on the sea.</p><p>The stone palace was built with huge stones, rugged and heavy, yet it was as light as a feather, rising and falling with the waves. Moreover, it was not fixed in one place, remaining unchanged, but moved randomly within a radius of a hundred miles.</p><p>Bound by some unknown force, the stone palace would not exceed this range. When it reached the edge, it was as if it encountered an invisible wall and bounced back.</p><p>With the stone palace as a place to rest, Tan Hao could travel between the two places in the future. However, it would be very difficult to bring disciples, and even bringing Core Formation Late-stage disciples could not guarantee safety.</p><p>Inside the stone palace.</p><p>It was empty, with four pillars at the four corners as the only support.</p><p>The stone palace had no walls, and the scenery outside was unobstructed.</p><p>Towering waves crashed continuously from all directions towards the stone palace.</p><p>The force of the hurricane and the huge waves was terrifying, as if they could tear apart everything in the world. The stone palace swayed in the storm, yet it was extremely sturdy. An invisible barrier blocked the impact and the clamor, making it exceptionally quiet.</p><p>The monotonous storms were really nothing to see.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tan Hao rested in the stone palace. After discussing, they decided to search for a while longer.</p><p>For Qin Sang, it was not a waste of time.</p><p>Because Qin Sang became more and more proficient in searching for sanctuaries, he tried to multitask, piloting the divine shuttle while cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, refining the demonic fire.</p><p>This was also what he planned to do on his way to the Central Province.</p><p>The Heaven and Earth Origin Qi in the storm belt was chaotic, making cultivation impossible while traveling. Fortunately, refining the demonic fire was not affected by external influences.</p><p>If he could refine all the demonic fire in the Demonic Banner, not only would he be able to cultivate a powerful divine ability that completely belonged to him, but his divine sense would also greatly increase.</p><p>After adjusting his state, Qin Sang and Tan Hao flew out of the stone palace again and began their long search.</p><p>In the dim storm belt, on the turbulent sea, a speck of azure light darted and weaved like a swimming fish, appearing and disappearing.</p><p>Suddenly, the azure light stopped.</p><p>Three figures flashed out from it, it was Qin Sang, Tan Hao, and his incarnation.</p><p>Just now, it was the incarnation that was controlling the divine shuttle.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head, his gaze swept down, and locked onto a section of the sea.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A gray hurricane had just swept past, leaving a bottomless ravine in the sea.</p><p>The water walls on both sides closed in, and huge waves surged, bringing with them astonishing pressure.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly swooped down, rushing into the middle of the water walls.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly had landed on his shoulder at some point. It spread its wings, and the Heavenly Eye aimed at the depths of the ravine, discovering anomalies that others could not see.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>Sword energy shot out like lightning.</p><p>The sword energy, which should have pierced through the ravine, was suddenly blocked halfway.</p><p>Crimson light suddenly appeared, rising from the sky like a volcanic eruption, engulfing the sword light.</p><p>Tan Hao's face showed deep surprise. Only when the crimson light erupted did he realize that there was actually a sanctuary here.</p><p>"What a well-hidden ancient restriction!"</p><p>Qin Sang dodged another hurricane, exhaled softly, and sighed.</p><p>If not for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, he would have definitely overlooked this place.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tan Hao opened the ancient restriction and entered. They found that this was an underwater island, the edges of which had been eroded away, leaving only the core protected by the ancient restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and nodded secretly. With this stone palace and the underwater island, Tan Hao could barely lead Core Formation stage disciples back and forth, and the two Green Goat Temples wouldn't be too separated.</p><p>From the time he first entered the storm belt, four years had passed.</p><p>Less than three years remained until Liuli's Tribulation Transcendence.</p><p>There was no time to find a third sanctuary, and things had to be sped up from here on.</p><p>Qin Sang drew a detailed sea chart and gave it to Tan Hao. Then, the two left the storm belt, crossed the desert and the Heavenly Travel Alliance, and headed straight for the Lesser Chill Domain.</p><p>Although they had experienced many things in the North Sea, Qin Sang had only been gone for about twenty years.</p><p>For cultivators, this was a short period.</p><p>However, many major events had recently occurred in the North Barrens Realm.</p><p>The most shocking one was the fall of Sage Cang Hong in the Abyss Ruins.</p><p>As time passed, the Abyss Ruins, having lost the Sin God Palace, became increasingly unstable and dangerous. Sage Cang Hong frequently entered the Abyss Ruins. Although he had managed to escape danger several times, he ultimately failed to avoid this calamity.</p><p>The Netherworld Ghost Monarch had also been in secluded cultivation for many years, with no news. There were rumors that he might be in a life-or-death seclusion, seeking to either succeed or perish.</p><p>The influential figures of the previous generation in the North Barrens Realm had either ascended or withered, becoming history.</p><p>Green Goat Temple.</p><p>Before the Sword Energy Cliff.</p><p>The newly initiated disciples, with their youthful faces, looked up with reverence at the words Qin Sang had carved with his sword energy.</p><p>Tan Yien lowered himself to personally explain it to them.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>I took two days of annual leave and am currently on my way back. I'll write a chapter on the bus first.</p><p>I've realized that as you get older, vacations are actually the most tiring.</p><p>I haven't been home since the New Year. My parents haven't been feeling well, and I didn't have time to check on them when they came to visit me during the Mid-Autumn Festival. This time, everything is crammed together. Plus, there are so many chores and social obligations at home waiting, and there's so little time. It's too rushed.</p><p>The updates have been unstable, and I've had to wake up early in the morning several times to catch up.</p><p>I'm not yet middle-aged and unmarried, so it's hard to imagine what the most difficult time in life would be like.</p><p>Last night, I really couldn't hold on any longer, and I didn't expect to sleep until I got on the bus today.</p><p>I'll be back on track tomorrow and will try my best to catch up. Thank you all for your understanding.</p>
