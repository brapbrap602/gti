<h1>Chapter 1636: The Burning Spirit Ghost Curse</h1><p>The roar of a monstrous serpent echoed alongside the voice of the avatar.</p><p>Its might overshadowed even the thousand-zhang giant crocodile!</p><p>The thousand-zhang crocodile below, the serpent above – both were incredibly ferocious.</p><p>The ice lake had become a battlefield for ancient beasts.</p><p>Without hesitation, the avatar summoned the four-part Serpent Seal treasure.  He didn’t approach the grotesque-faced man, denying the jade beetle a chance to attack.</p><p>With a thought, the serpent descended from the sky on icy flames. It didn't charge directly at the grotesque-faced man, but instead cut him off from the Weeping Spirit Cave Master!</p><p>…</p><p>Flags lined the ice lake.</p><p>Once drawn into the flag formation, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master vanished from the grotesque-faced man's sight.</p><p>幽蓝天光 and a cold wind surrounded the formation; the power of the damaged array was still formidable.</p><p>Unfortunately, as the formation's power grew, the damaged flag shadows shook more violently. Soon, the first shadow dissipated.</p><p>The dissipation of a flag shadow meant the corresponding flag in the array's core had been destroyed.</p><p>The second, the third…</p><p>Flags continued to crumble.</p><p>Before its power reached its peak, the array began to weaken.</p><p>One by one, the ghostly flag images vanished from the formation.</p><p>Each destroyed flag created a weakness in the array, potentially a fatal flaw. Thus, even with the successful ambush of the Ice Palace array, Qin Sang wouldn't have much time.</p><p>Conversely, for the Weeping Spirit Cave Master, this was his chance to escape!</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master's cry for help was cut short, swallowed by the formation.</p><p>The battle situation changed in an instant. The Weeping Spirit Cave Master felt the world turn upside down. When he regained his senses, he could no longer see the outside, only layers upon layers of幽蓝天光 and biting wind stretching endlessly.</p><p>Faint flag shadows surrounded him, rotating constantly, leaving no gap.</p><p>The shadows spun faster and faster.</p><p>All of them were rapidly closing in, lethal intent palpable.  In this precarious situation, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master had to save himself; he couldn't rely solely on the grotesque-faced man.</p><p>Yet, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master was still targeted by the blood crocodile bone hand.</p><p>At that moment, the red flower treasure, summoned back by the Weeping Spirit Cave Master, blazed with a vibrant red light – a scarlet brilliance like blood itself.</p><p>The red flower hung upside down, its crown aimed at the Weeping Spirit Cave Master. A crimson column of light shot downwards, engulfing him.</p><p>This treasure had protected its master several times, and despite the majority of the malevolent spirits being eliminated by the sword array, it still possessed considerable power.</p><p>Bathing in the red light, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master’s expression relaxed slightly.  The formation’s chilling aura was blocked by the red light, unable to approach, and its suction force weakened.</p><p>He finally regained his footing, but didn't rush into the array. His hands crossed in front of his chest, fingers weaving spirit threads, drawing complex runes in the air.</p><p>The runes were composed of tadpole-like strokes, their meaning unclear.</p><p>As the Weeping Spirit Cave Master pressed them towards the void, the runes collided, splitting and reforming, broken pieces reconnecting, their shapes entirely different from before, finally forming a distorted rune image.</p><p>The edges of the image were uneven, but inside was a human-shaped figure, trapped and writhing.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master repeated the process, creating four such rune images, positioned in the four directions around him, similar in form but subtly different.</p><p>The four rune images were connected energetically.</p><p>After completing them, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master spread his right hand wide, his palm brimming with true energy, which transformed into four streams of light, shooting towards the four rune images.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>…</p><p>The rune images exploded upon completion, and a ghostly figure darted out from the fragments.</p><p>The ghost's appearance was accompanied by an overwhelming aura of evil – an extremely wicked demonic entity. The malevolent spirits the Weeping Spirit Cave Master had previously released were no match for this demon.</p><p>However, after years of cultivation and significant effort, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master had only nurtured four such demons, far fewer than the malevolent spirits.</p><p>More was not necessarily better.</p><p>These extremely wicked beings were inherently bloodthirsty and lacked intelligence. Even the Weeping Spirit Cave Master, who had created them, needed to seal them with secret techniques except when absolutely necessary.  Releasing them for a period, required them to be re-sealed afterwards; otherwise, it was uncertain whether they would kill enemies or turn against their creator.</p><p>Free from the rune image, the demon let out shrill screams, its form twisting erratically, circling the Weeping Spirit Cave Master. Its gaze held no obedience, but the predatory stare of a hunter, its expression shifting eerily between a sinister smile and fierce aggression.</p><p>A flush crept onto the Weeping Spirit Cave Master's face.</p><p>He was still recovering from his hidden injuries, but he couldn't afford to let that concern him now.  He immediately suppressed the boiling rage within him, silently activating his spell-breaking technique.  He pointed at the flag array and hissed, "Go!"</p><p>The shadow demons flinched, seemingly reluctant.</p><p>But their movements were not slow at all; they all obediently followed the Cave Master's order, turning to attack the flag images, attempting to destroy the array.</p><p>The flag array had already been activated, transforming into a killing formation that would let no one escape.</p><p>As soon as the shadow demons broke free from the red light, the intact flag images blazed with brilliant light, reaching towards the heavens.  Immediately, several beams of ethereal blue light transformed into swords, shooting towards the demons.</p><p>The Cave Master's expression remained unchanged; he subtly curled his finger.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Four shadow demons were pierced by the ethereal blue light almost simultaneously. Some were even struck by multiple beams. The menacing shadow demons instantly froze in place.</p><p>Then, they vanished into thin air.</p><p>All were afterimages!</p><p>Further away, shadows swirled and recombined, the shadow demons reappearing.  They were ethereal beings, their inky bodies showing no signs of injury.</p><p>Immediately, one demon lunged, seizing the opportunity to slip through several flag images, appearing above the flag array, in the area of the most intense ethereal blue light.</p><p>This was one of the array's weaknesses!</p><p>The Cave Master keenly observed the demon's movements. Seeing the demon successfully infiltrate, his eyes lit up, and he immediately ordered the demons to attack with all their might.</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>The shadow demons pressed forward, seemingly chaotic but actually following a hidden pattern, leaving trails of afterimages.  It appeared all their attacks missed their mark, but the flag images within the array vibrated several times more violently than before.  Where they attacked, the ethereal light tore, showing signs of forming holes.</p><p>Under the relentless assault of the shadow demons, the gaps in the flag array widened. But the Cave Master still found the pace too slow and made a hand seal.</p><p>"Condense Form!"</p><p>The shadow demons froze, resisting as they turned their heads to look at each other. They let out desperate screams, but were helpless; they lunged towards their companions, beginning to merge and condense.</p><p>Their nature was greedy and bloodthirsty. If their master allowed them to devour each other, they wouldn't hesitate.  However, this merging was against their will.</p><p>As the shadow demons merged, the Cave Master's blood began to boil again.</p><p>The four shadow demons transformed into a mass of black shadow. The shadow writhed, contracting towards its center, then stretched and deformed in places, finally becoming a demonic beast that resembled a dog but was not quite one!</p><p>The demonic beast had thick legs, nearly one hundred meters tall. Although not as large as the thousand-meter crocodile, it would still terrify anyone who saw it.</p><p>It raised its head to the heavens, its four feet pounding the void. It let out a mournful howl, opened its maw, and a mass of black demonic light formed in its mouth, aimed at the nascent hole, and shot out fiercely!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The demonic light surged into the hole.</p><p>A round black hole appeared amidst the ethereal blue light.</p><p>Demons poured forth from the hole, expanding and seeping outwards.  The demonic beast continued to spew forth demonic light.</p><p>The power of the flag array immediately became chaotic.</p><p>The Cave Master extended his left palm, summoning the wooden spike.  Simultaneously, he controlled the red flower artifact, condensing a beam of light, and slammed it into the center of the suction.</p><p>Restrictions flashed in the void, but none could withstand the wooden spike, shattering one after another.</p><p>It seemed a path was about to be carved through the flag array.</p><p>Just as a look of relief appeared in the Cave Master's eyes, he felt an inexplicable unease. Then, he saw through the flag images a ball of black demonic fire.</p><p>The demonic fire raged.</p><p>Behind the demonic fire, a shadowy figure appeared in the Cave Master's eyes, deeply stinging them.</p><p>At that moment, the Cave Master suddenly felt that he was about to face a great calamity. A chill went from the soles of his feet to the top of his head, making his hair stand on end!</p><p>The demonic fire dragon roared, emitting terrifying waves of power.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's true form finally arrived, having bypassed the poisonous light.  He flung his sleeve, unleashing the Nine Nether Demonic Fire at the flag array.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The demonic fire surged forth.</p><p>Even before the fire dragon arrived, the aura of the demonic fire caused the blood in the Cave Master's body to freeze.  A cry escaped his throat, and he spat out a ball of white light.</p><p>A string of jade prayer beads appeared in the white light.</p><p>As soon as they appeared, the beads scattered, instantly dispersing in all directions. It was a set of array artifacts.</p><p>The shadows of the beads swayed, white light flashed, forming a jade screen-like image.</p><p>This was a defensive array, quite powerful.  While releasing the Yin Devils, the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave secretly activated the array, but held back from fully unleashing it.</p><p>There's a saying among mortals about striking the enemy mid-crossing. The Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave knew that unless the Mask-Faced Man could hold the enemy back, he would face resistance the moment he broke free from the array.  He was prepared for this.</p><p>The jade barrier was nearing completion.</p><p>Suddenly, the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave heard a sound – a strange “Humph!”  The sound, without warning, pierced his eardrums, resonated in his Purple Mansion, and felt like a sharp awl stabbing his soul.  The pain was unbearable, and he groaned in agony.</p><p>Qin Sang, having diligently cultivated the Fire Seed Golden Lotus for many years, already possessed a powerful consciousness.  Furthermore, having obtained the soul treasure, the Thousand Knot Soul Net, the power of his soul-capturing incantation was now unparalleled.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>With his soul in excruciating pain, the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave could no longer focus on controlling the array.  The nearly completed jade barrier violently shook, scattering the beads.</p><p>With a “Boom,” the remaining light of the barrier and the scattered jade beads were swept away by the fiery dragon in an instant, posing no obstacle whatsoever.</p><p>Facing imminent death, the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave had no time to use any other abilities.  Moreover, he was still trapped within the flag array; a Nascent Soul escape would also lead to death.</p><p>His face was filled with terror, his bloodshot eyes darting wildly.</p><p>Solid, blood-red eyes focused on the Yin Devil beast above.  Simultaneously, blood flowed continuously from the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave's eyes, forming blood-red threads that wriggled like living things, covering his face and spreading to his entire body.</p><p>In a flash, the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave was covered in a network of blood.</p><p>The blood began to burn, and a raging inferno of blood enveloped him.</p><p>The Yin Devil beast's roar suddenly became shrill. Its body curled up into a ball, transforming into an evil light that shot into the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave's head.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave’s neck arched, his tendons bulging as he let out a horrifying cry.</p><p>Then, the evil light flowed through the burning blood, and the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave's flesh began to grow wildly, his skin swelling and bulging.</p><p>Amidst the evil light and the flames, the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave vanished, replaced by a terrifying monster unlike any human form.  Only his head remained the same, appearing to sprout from a mass of decaying flesh.</p><p>This was the Burning Spirit Ghost Curse, merging a Yin Devil into oneself, instantly granting terrifying power.  However, the curse carries immense risks and should only be used in life-or-death situations. This was the first time the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave had used it to save himself since learning it.</p><p>Transformed into a monster, the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave leaped up, attempting to smash through the flag array.</p><p>Through the layers of flags, Tianmu witnessed the horrifying scene of the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave’s transformation. Qin Sang’s pupils constricted, but his movements did not falter; instead, the speed of the fiery dragon increased.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The fiery dragon engulfed the blood flames and slammed into the monster.</p><p>The Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave hadn't had enough time; his transformation was incomplete.</p><p>His flesh exploded like fireworks, scattering gore and body parts everywhere, including his head, which was mostly incinerated by the fiery dragon.  Only a section of his neck remained, connected to his head, spinning through the air, drenched in blood, before being swallowed by the flames.</p><p>At the moment of death, the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave's eyes were lifeless, offering no resistance before being reduced to ashes.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, changed his hand seal, and the fiery dragon dispersed into a sea of flames. He then used his Golden Sinking Sword to lay down a celestial net, destroying every fragment of flesh and blood.</p><p>“Dead?”</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly surprised.</p><p>The Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave's Nascent Soul had indeed perished with his body.  One of Qin Sang's goals in drawing his opponent into the array was to prevent the escape of his Nascent Soul, and the possibility of revival.</p><p>It seems the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave understood that a Nascent Soul escape would only delay the inevitable; capture of his Nascent Soul would mean eternal damnation.  He’d chosen to merge with the Yin Devil for a final desperate gamble.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze over the empty flag array.</p><p>For some reason, he felt something was amiss; the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave's decisiveness seemed excessive.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed. He withdrew the fiery dragon and the sword array and fled.</p><p>At that very moment…</p><p>The ice lake was completely frozen.</p><p>The thousand-zhang crocodile, having lost its target, was poised to attack.</p><p>The surrounding area was a mess, countless palaces collapsed.</p><p>The remaining array was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The pale blue sky light hung low, threatening to collapse at any moment.  The spiritual array power in other parts of the Ice Palace was significantly weakened.  The Mask-Faced Man, pursued by Qin Sang’s transformed form, was fleeing, a strand of blood qi wrapped around his right wrist—a living evil spirit!</p><p>Suddenly, the pain on the evil spirit's face disappeared, its features contorting into the likeness of the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave.</p><p>Even in the face of crisis, the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave had not forgotten to leave a contingency.  When the red flower had given birth to evil spirits, forming a river of blood that directly confronted the Seven Souls Killing Array, he had secretly dispatched dozens of evil spirits.</p><p>Most were destroyed by the shockwave, but this one survived.</p><p>Never imagining his own demise, his habitual contingency had become his only chance of survival.  Sensing the remaining evil spirit, he was overjoyed.  His seemingly desperate struggle was a cover for a secret technique, enabling him to reincarnate using the spirit.</p><p>The evil spirit, its face filled with malice, realized its predicament, its expression freezing. Then it heard the Mask-Faced Man’s chilling voice.</p><p>“Even facing death, the Lord has the means to reincarnate. I admire his resourcefulness! But that person is incredibly powerful, able to control the Ice Palace's great array.  If I hadn't protected this evil spirit, do you think you could have escaped?”</p>
