<h1>Chapter 116: Demons of the Heart</h1><p>Black Tiger Ravine.</p><p>Qin Sang and his master, Gu Tiannan, landed outside the village, concealing their auras as they approached.  Most of the houses in the desolate village were empty, shrouded in a deathly silence.  The morning mist lingered, and not a single wisp of smoke rose from any chimney.  A few emaciated elders sat in front of their homes, their gazes vacant and distant.  Qin Sang could sense only one thing in their eyes: despair.</p><p>“The evil being has taken all the villagers with strong life force, even the children, leaving only these elderly behind,” Gu Tiannan sighed softly.</p><p>“Have you found any bodies?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Gu Tiannan shook his head, pointing to a dark mountain behind the village. “There's a cave behind that mountain.  A demonic barrier seals the entrance, and there are two evil beings, both quite powerful.  I wounded one last time, but the other rescued it. I was outnumbered, so I asked Junior Brother Qin to come.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the rear mountain. Aside from its height, there was nothing remarkable about it. But under the dim light of dawn, the dark silhouette seemed to exude a ghostly mist, giving it an eerie appearance.</p><p>He yearned to ascend the mountain immediately, resolve the issue, and return to the sect.  However, he also needed to consider Gu Tiannan's advice.</p><p>Gu Tiannan suggested they wait until noon. “I don't know what kind of wicked cultivation technique this demonic creature practices, but at noon, the yang energy is at its peak. If we strike then, the yin and evil energy will be suppressed.”</p><p>The three found an empty house. Qin Sang sat alone, meditating and adjusting his state of mind. A persistent, inexplicable irritability plagued him, taking a long time to subside.</p><p>Something's not right!</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, a look of alertness on his face. He mentally reviewed his journey from Mount Shaohua to the Ancient Abyss Kingdom, realizing that in his eagerness to return and borrow the token, he hadn't carefully considered anything. He had been led along the entire way, focused solely on completing the task quickly.</p><p>An evil being disturbing a mortal kingdom was a minor matter, yet it had caught the attention of Senior Master Wen, who specifically dispatched him. Was there a deeper meaning? Was it truly just to silence the gossipmongers?</p><p>The information about the evil being came solely from Gu Tiannan, and Qin Sang hadn't questioned it.  This realization sent a chill down his spine.</p><p>In cultivation, there was the concept of tempering one's Dao Heart and resisting inner demons. Qin Sang had never taken it seriously. He relied on the Jade Buddha's protection. Even the Three Calamities Heart-Devouring Formation, born from the Minor Heavenly Tribulation, was ineffective against him. Why should he care about inner demons?</p><p>Now he understood that inner demons weren't always tangible. His current state could be described as being infested with them.</p><p>Ever since the Soul Pill lost its efficacy, he had been consumed by fear and worry, his mind obsessed with Foundation Establishment.  He had become driven by impatience and a thirst for quick results. Beyond that, he cared about nothing, indifferent to everything. He had become like a madman.</p><p>Inner demons affected not only his Dao Heart but also his state of mind and actions.  In this condition, he dared to leave the sect and slay evil? He wouldn't even know how he died!</p><p>Calm the heart, calm the breath. Abbot Jixin had taught him this long ago, yet he had completely forgotten.</p><p>Qin Sang silently recited the *Qingjing Jing* several times, forcing himself to forget the words "Foundation Establishment." Finally, the chaotic thoughts faded one by one.  He felt his mind become clearer.</p><p>His pursuit of the Dao remained firm, but it no longer controlled him.</p><p>Although this didn't directly enhance his cultivation, Qin Sang knew it would benefit him in the future.</p><p>…</p><p>*Knock! Knock!*</p><p>Someone knocked on the door. Gu Yuan softly called, “Uncle Qin.” Qin Sang brushed off nonexistent dust from his robe, a natural and appropriate smile appearing on his face as he opened the door.</p><p>Outside, the sun blazed overhead.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly to the master and disciple, adopting a different mindset as he discreetly observed and assessed Gu Tiannan.</p><p>He recalled the records in the jade slip.  Every few years, an evil being would wreak havoc in the Ancient Abyss Kingdom, and each time, Gu Tiannan would handle it efficiently. His requests for aid were always timely, and the resolutions were swift and clean.</p><p>Such a coincidence!</p><p>Mount Shaohua had a Sun De. Why couldn’t there be another?</p><p>Seeing Gu Tiannan's face, so pale it was devoid of any color, Qin Sang finally understood his unease.  That complexion was identical to a corpse’s; he had seen it countless times on the battlefields of the Great Sui.</p><p>However, Gu Tiannan was already over a hundred years old and a direct disciple of Mount Shaohua. Qin Sang couldn't conclusively judge him based on this alone.  Moreover, he didn't sense any demonic aura from Gu Tiannan.</p><p>Protect myself, and then wait and see.</p><p>**Chapter 116: Inner Demon**</p><p>**Black Tiger Ravine**</p><p>Qin Sang and his master Gu Tiannan landed their spiritual lights on the dirt road outside the village, concealed themselves, and stealthily approached.</p><p>The isolated village stood almost deserted, silent as the grave. The morning mist hadn't dispersed yet, and no wisps of smoke curled from the chimneys. A few haggard elders sat at the doors of their homes, their vacant eyes gazing into the distance. The scene filled Qin Sang with a potent sense of despair.</p><p>"The evil spirits have kidnapped the most vibrant villagers for their blood essence," Gu Tiannan sighed softly. "They haven't even spared the children. Only these elderly folks are left."</p><p>"Have you found any corpses?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Gu Tiannan shook his head and pointed to a dark mountain behind the village. "There's a cave behind that mountain. Its entrance is guarded by a demonic formation, and there are two evil spirits inside, both of considerable strength. I managed to injure one of them last time, but the other rescued it. I couldn't handle both of them alone, so I invited you here, Junior Brother Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the mountain. It was nothing special, merely taller than the others. But under the dim light of the sky, its black silhouette seemed to ooze an eerie mist, giving it an ominous appearance.</p><p>He was eager to ascend the mountain, take care of the problem, and return to the sect to report his success. But he had to listen to Gu Tiannan's advice.</p><p>Gu Tiannan suggested they wait until midday to make their move. "I don't know what evil arts these fiends practice, but their power wanes at noon when yang energy is at its peak. We should strike then. The yin energy will be suppressed."</p><p>The three of them found an empty house. Qin Sang meditated alone to regulate his condition, but his mind was inexplicably agitated and restless. It took him a long time to calm down.</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, a look of vigilance on his face. He went over his journey from Mount Shaohua to the ancient kingdom of Gu Yuan, and he realized he had been too hasty in his desire to return and borrow the waist token. He hadn't thought carefully about anything and had been led by the nose the whole way, focused solely on completing his task.</p><p>The presence of evil spirits in a mortal kingdom was a trivial matter, yet it had caught the attention of Master Wen, who had deliberately sent him. Was this significant? Was it really just to stop the chatter?</p><p>Qin Sang had taken Gu Tiannan's account of the evil spirits at face value, but he hadn't thought deeply about it. As this realization dawned on him, a cold sweat broke out on his body.</p><p>In cultivation, there was a saying about refining one's Dao heart and resisting inner demons, but Qin Sang had never taken it seriously. He relied on the Jade Buddha to aid him. Even the Three Disasters Heart-Eating Formation, a refinement descended from the minor heavenly tribulation, had been helpless against him, so why should he worry about inner demons?</p><p>Now, he understood that inner demons didn't have to be tangible. His current state could be described as a breeding ground for inner demons.</p><p>Ever since his soul pill had failed, his heart had been filled with fear and worry. His mind had been consumed by the thought of Foundation Establishment. He was nothing short of a maniac, driven by a reckless desire to advance. Beyond that, he cared for nothing, his mind in a frenzy.</p><p>Inner demons affected not only one's Dao heart but also one's state of mind and actions. In his present state, he had dared to leave the sect to eliminate the evil spirits. He would have died without even knowing how!</p><p>Meditation, tranquility. Daoist Jixin had taught him this long ago, but he had forgotten it completely.</p><p>Qin Sang silently recited the Sutra of Purity and Emptiness several times, forcing himself to forget the words "Foundation Establishment." He finally managed to dispel the chaotic thoughts, and his state of mind became noticeably clearer.</p><p>His determination to seek the Dao was unwavering, but he would not be ruled by it.</p><p>Although it didn't directly benefit his cultivation, Qin Sang knew that this realization would benefit him greatly in the future.</p><p>…</p><p>"Knock! Knock!"</p><p>Someone knocked on the door. Gu Yuan softly called, "Uncle Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang lightly brushed off the non-existent dust from his Daoist robe and replaced it with a naturally amiable smile as he opened the door.</p><p>Outside, the sun was high in the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly at the master and disciple. He assumed a different demeanor and subtly observed Gu Tiannan.</p><p>As recorded in the jade slip, the ancient kingdom of Gu Yuan experienced demonic disturbances every few years, and each time, Gu Tiannan had handled them skillfully. He had also sought help in a timely manner, resolving the situations in exemplary fashion.</p><p>What a coincidence!</p><p>If there was a Sun De on Mount Shaohua, why couldn't there be a second one?</p><p>Looking at Gu Tiannan's face, which was so pale it lacked any trace of blood, Qin Sang finally understood why he felt uneasy. Such a complexion was identical to that of the dead. He had seen it countless times on the battlefields of the Great Sui Dynasty.</p><p>However, Gu Tiannan was already a century old and a direct disciple of Mount Shaohua. Qin Sang couldn't decisively judge him as a problematic figure based on this alone, and he didn't sense any evil aura emanating from him either.</p><p>He would protect himself and let events unfold.</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind was racing as he set this strategy in motion, focusing his mind on the Heavenly Star Tear and Ebony Sword, ready to respond to any sudden changes. He also secretly prepared some spirit seals and the black bead, feeling confident that he could guarantee his safety. Following behind Masters Gu Tiannan and Ouyang Xulin, he cast an escaping spell and ascended the mountain.</p><p>The mountain was not particularly rugged, and the trio quickly crossed the peak and arrived at the back.</p><p>The cavern in the back of the mountain was extremely eye-catching: the cave entrance was several zhang wide, and its dark maw resembled the Demonic Eye on the grand surface of the earth, filled with black fog which obscured one’s view.</p><p>Concealed in the shadows, the trio observed the cavern. The demonic energy at the entrance of the cave flowed very regularly, like a whirlpool, rotating in circles. Qin Sang could sense a dangerous aura from within, and Gu Tiannan’s statement regarding the demonic formation’s influence was likely not false.</p><p>“Junior Brother Qin, do you have any means of breaking the formation?” Gu Tiannan asked through sound transmission.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, deep in thought. If he were to deploy the Ten Directions Yama Formation, it should not be difficult to break the formation with another formation. However, he had already decided to observe Gu Tiannan first, and it would be best not to reveal his trump card before then. After taking out the Azure Wave Sword, he replied, “Senior Brother Gu, I primarily cultivate the way of the sword. While I am capable of facing the enemy head-on, breaking formations is not my strong suit.”</p><p>Gu Tiannan did not doubt him. Upon hearing this, he nodded and patted his mustard seed bag. Immediately, five dazzling sword lights flew out from within. Gu Tiannan chanted some incantations and sent waves of spiritual energy towards the sword lights, which immediately flared brightly.</p><p>Qin Sang looked closely and discovered that each of the five sword lights contained a spirit sword. He immediately recalled a famous spell from Mount Shaohua called the Five Elements Formation-Breaking Sword. It required five elemental spirit swords, and relying on the spell, it harnessed the spiritual energy of the five elements of heaven and earth, specializing in breaking formations.</p><p>When Qin Sang had heard a senior uncle giving a sermon, he had learned about this spell. Not only was it extremely time-consuming to cultivate, but one also needed to prepare the appropriate five elemental spirit swords. The opportunities to use it were few, so he had not cultivated it.</p><p>Judging from Gu Tiannan’s demeanor, he was clearly extremely proficient in this spell.</p><p>As Gu Tiannan continued his movements, the five spirit swords gradually became covered in densely packed spells. The sword lights were dazzling, and each spirit sword stirred the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Gu Tiannan’s eyes flashed with brilliance as he let out a cold cry and pointed at the cave entrance. The five sword lights silently broke through the air and disappeared.</p><p>Seeing the Five Elements Formation-Breaking Sword vanishing into the depths of the demonic energy, there was not a single sound.</p><p>However, Gu Tiannan was not worried at all, and he smiled as he gazed at the cave entrance.</p><p>In the next moment, a buzzing sword cry echoed from within the cave, and紧接着天地灵气陡然暴动！</p><p>The sword lights pierced the darkness, and countless spiritual energy was rapidly sucked into the cave entrance, then suddenly expanded. Following an earth-shattering explosion, the demonic energy within the cave instantly shattered!</p>
