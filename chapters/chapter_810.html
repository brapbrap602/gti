<h1>Chapter 802: The Demonic Seed</h1><p>At Mount Baogu, Qin Sang remained in his cave dwelling for several days.</p><p>One of the greatest difficulties of the *Seed of Demonic Origin* technique was refining the Demonic Seed.  Qin Sang, possessing a Sword Soul, found this task significantly easier.</p><p>Nevertheless, this demonic art remained obscure and difficult to comprehend. Qin Sang's first task was to capture the fragmented soul within his sword light.</p><p>The fusion of sword light and a fragmented soul was unheard of in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally intended to take his time, but unexpectedly discovered that in the process of sensing the fragment, his swordsmanship was also subtly improving.  He decided to enter seclusion to simultaneously comprehend both the sword path and the demonic art.</p><p>Unconsciously, more than ten days passed.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>The ebony sword floated before him.</p><p>To its left and right were two beams of sword light.</p><p>His eyes were fixed on the sword light imbued with the technique.  Having received the message from Senior Qingzhu and further comprehending the division of sword light, after days of exploration, he finally perceived the difference in this particular beam.</p><p>This sword light was exceptionally stable, and its connection with its master was more intimate.</p><p>“Shatter!”</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang formed a hand seal and softly uttered a single word.</p><p>With a 'crack', the sword light, like shattered glass, fragmented into countless pieces.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly clutched his head, emitting a painful groan.</p><p>The shattering of the Sword Soul brought a needle-like pain.  However, this pain was far less intense than the original *Seed of Demonic Origin* technique, and Qin Sang could endure it.</p><p>Quickly, Qin Sang adapted to the stinging pain. He raised his head, his eyes blood-red, and gritted his teeth, focusing entirely on completing the demonic art.</p><p>Following Qin Sang's movements, the fragments of the Sword Soul began to merge.</p><p>Gradually, as if a drop of ink had spread from the center of the Sword Soul, it eventually turned completely black.</p><p>The Sword Soul vanished, replaced by a Demonic Seed, like a black drop of water. Although it wasn't a Demonic Seed cultivated entirely through demonic methods, it still exuded a strong sense of malevolence.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it for a while, then withdrew the Demonic Seed into his Nascent Soul space to await its gestation. He then opened the insect basket.</p><p>He had heard a stir from the basket while refining the Demonic Seed; the Fat Silkworm had awakened.</p><p>After swallowing the poisonous mist, the Fat Silkworm had fallen into a deep sleep. Upon awakening, besides a slightly stronger aura, there were no other visible changes.</p><p>Qin Sang had long grown accustomed to this and found it unsurprising. Even if the Fat Silkworm's only ability was detoxification, it was sufficient. With continued growth, it might be able to withstand all poisons in the world.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang retrieved a piece of Amethyst from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Seeing the Amethyst, the Fat Silkworm's small eyes gleamed with greed. It seemed to never know satiety, wriggling in Qin Sang's palm, demanding the treat.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't tease it, bringing the Amethyst close. The Fat Silkworm broke through its self-constructed barrier and took a bite of the Amethyst with a crisp 'crack'.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's direct and violent approach startled Qin Sang, who anxiously observed its condition.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's throat pulsed as it swallowed the Amethyst fragment. Then, drowsiness overcame it, and it fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>“A small piece at a time is enough. Sleeping so deeply, it probably won't wake up for a while. It seems these Amethysts will last for a long time…”</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was a picky eater, and finding food it liked wasn't easy.  He had rummaged through the belongings of the Hook-Nosed Man for a long time, but hadn't found the origin of the poisonous smoke.</p><p>He then summoned the Sky-Eyed Butterfly and fed it spirit herbs, hoping it would soon achieve a breakthrough.</p><p>After feeding the Fat Silkworm and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, Qin Sang contemplated the sword path for a while before leaving the cave dwelling and heading down the mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>He changed his appearance and bought a mortal dwelling at the foot of Mount Baogu as a base.</p><p>Then he went alone to the marketplace.</p><p>The marketplace of Tianxing City was vast, with numerous cultivators from within and outside the city trading daily. It was arguably the most prosperous location in the Canglang Sea cultivation world.</p><p>“Exquisite Pavilion…”</p><p>Qin Sang wandered around the marketplace, finally arriving before a small shop.</p><p>The name was elegant, but the shop itself was unremarkable. Like other shops, it sold common cultivation world items like talismans, magical tools, and elixirs.</p><p>At the moment, there were no customers inside.</p><p>The Exquisite Pavilion was the meeting place Lady Liu had arranged with him. Qin Sang observed from outside for a moment, then stepped inside.</p><p>The shop owner was a white-haired old man, his cultivation only at the Foundation Establishment stage. Given his age, he clearly wouldn't be forming a Gold Core.  Seeing Qin Sang enter, he was about to rise and greet him when he suddenly heard the chime of a bell. His expression changed slightly.</p><p>The owner glanced at Qin Sang's sleeve and immediately led him to the back room.</p><p>“May I ask who Senior is?”</p><p>The owner inquired cautiously.</p><p>“I am Qingfeng.  Lady Liu should have mentioned me.”</p><p>Qin Sang showed the copper bell.  “Lady Liu instructed me to find the Exquisite Pavilion in Tianxing City.  If there are confidential matters, they should be communicated through the Exquisite Pavilion. Did she mention this to you?”</p><p>The owner nodded repeatedly.  “My master just gave those instructions. I've been waiting for Senior's arrival... Forgive my poor eyesight; I took you for a monastic and didn't recognize you.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded nonchalantly and got straight to the point. “I’ve rented a small courtyard in the city. This is the address. I've placed restrictions within the courtyard.  Tell Lady Liu to go directly to the courtyard to contact me…”</p><p>Leaving the address, Qin Sang didn't waste any words and took his leave.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang resumed his original appearance and began to wander through the marketplace.</p><p>He bought some cultivation supplies from several shops, and casually inquired about Spirit Turtle Island.</p><p>As expected, Spirit Turtle Island wasn't well-known. Senior Qingzhu was indeed very low-key. Qin Sang asked around, but no one knew the name of Spirit Turtle Island's master.</p><p>Only one person mentioned a small island called Spirit Turtle Island near their hometown. It was a place where mortals lived, with thin spiritual energy. It was impossible for cultivators to reside there, and there was no island master.</p><p>Beyond this region of the sea, no one knew of the island’s existence.</p><p>Countless islands dotted the Canglang Sea, so it wasn't surprising for names to be repeated.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled through the marketplace for the entire day, finally arriving at a place called the Auspicious Peace Auction House. The name lacked grandeur, suggesting a desire for secluded prosperity and peace.</p><p>However, this auction house was jointly built by the three major merchant alliances and was the largest in Tianxing City.</p><p>Upon entering the auction house, with his cultivation level, he naturally received a warm welcome, with no sign of disdain.</p><p>After being ushered into a quiet room by an attendant, Qin Sang handed her a jade slip.</p><p>“I'm looking to purchase a certain spirit fruit, but I don't know its name. The jade slip contains images of the fruit and the plant…”</p><p>He had searched around, but hadn't been able to identify the spirit fruit obtained from the Seven Kills Hall. He had no choice but to come to the auction house, fabricating a reason to purchase the fruit.</p><p>The auction house was filled with renowned alchemists, arguably the most knowledgeable individuals. If they couldn't recognize it, Qin Sang doubted he would have much luck elsewhere.</p><p>“Please wait a moment, Senior…”</p><p>The attendant reviewed the jade slip and bowed before leaving.</p><p>Shortly afterward, an alchemist entered the room.</p>
