<h1>Chapter 747: The Jade-Green Bees</h1><p>The Grand Sorcerer and the Demon Lord.</p><p>Two late Nascent Soul cultivators, apex powerhouses of the world, appeared together in the Seven Kills Palace, casting a pall over everyone. The good news was that the Demon Lord vanished in a different direction from where they were headed.</p><p>Everyone's expression was varied, still immersed in the sensation of being affected by the Lunar Wraith Divine Light.</p><p>Only Qin Sang remained unaffected by the divine light. "The Jade Buddha seems to perfectly counter the Lunar Wraith Divine Light, having no effect on me. However, for it to be crowned the greatest divine light of the Boundless Sea, it shouldn't be so simple. If I truly encounter the Demon Lord's followers in the future, I should still be cautious."</p><p>But his heart remained heavy because the direction in which the Lunar Wraith Divine Light disappeared was precisely the direction of the Celestial Tower.</p><p>"Xiang Yi said that the Demon Lord's appearance here was an accident, most likely aimed at the Sorcerer Tribe, to restrain the Grand Sorcerer.  With so many secret grounds in the Seven Kills Palace, it's unlikely they would all gather at the Celestial Tower by coincidence, right?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, his gaze serious, but he could do nothing.</p><p>So many top experts entering the Celestial Tower; even if he went there now, he couldn't change anything. It was better to wait until the Demon Lord and the Grand Sorcerer left before going in alone to investigate, lest he be caught up in the conflict.</p><p>As for the ancient teleportation formation, he wasn't too worried.</p><p>More than one cultivator had entered, but none had discovered it.</p><p>Either its location was extremely concealed, or, like the Sword Testing Hall of the Purple Star Palace, there was a special restriction outside, requiring a certain condition to be met. Otherwise, even the most profound cultivation would be useless.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected it was most likely the latter.</p><p>In the Boundless Sea, only he and Qing Zhu had cultivated the "Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture."</p><p>With Qing Zhu missing, only he could activate the ancient teleportation formation.</p><p>……</p><p>The sword-wielding young man and Cui Ji had recovered to about seventy or eighty percent before being urged to get up.</p><p>Xiang Yi pointed towards the ancient forest at the edge of the wasteland and ordered them to set off.</p><p>The wasteland was very peaceful, with no apparent dangers.</p><p>After a swift flight, the group quickly reached the edge of the wasteland.</p><p>They hadn't realized it before, but upon approaching the forest, they found that the ancient trees within were excessively tall, the smallest of which had a girth requiring a dozen people to embrace.</p><p>The canopy blocked out the sky and the sun, making the forest dark and gloomy. Strange sounds echoed intermittently, accompanied by flickering green lights. It was unknown whether they were emitted by demonic beasts or something else.</p><p>As they stood there, the ancient trees seemed to come alive, transforming into clawing giants that looked down upon them, creating immense pressure.</p><p>"Once inside the forest, it's best to avoid flying."</p><p>Xiang Yi landed on the ground, his expression serious as he warned, "Not only are there large areas of flight restrictions within the forest, but some of these ancient trees are actually living creatures in disguise. If you are entangled by vines while flying, others might not have time to rescue you before you are dragged into the depths of the forest."</p><p>"Living creatures? Are they some kind of demonic beast adept at camouflage, or Wood Spirits? If they're Wood Spirits, Pan has a treasure that can restrain such wood elementals."</p><p>The man wearing half a mask spoke in a hoarse voice.</p><p>This man surnamed Pan had been even more taciturn than Qin Sang throughout the journey, keeping to himself and barely interacting with others.</p><p>Everyone was somewhat surprised that he had taken the initiative to speak and assumed the responsibility of dealing with Wood Spirits.</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>Xiang Yi shook his head. "The living creatures here are incomparable to those outside; they cannot be categorized as demonic beasts or Wood Spirits. Even the spiritual insects here are completely different from the outside world. They have transformed due to some unknown influence, as you will soon see. The Merchant Alliance has already prepared countermeasures for us. Fellow Daoist Pan's treasure can serve as a backup. As long as you follow me closely, there's nothing to worry about."</p><p>With that, Xiang Yi took out several sachet-like objects and tossed them to everyone.</p><p>Qin Sang took one, squeezed it, and found it seemed to contain some kind of medicinal powder. He brought it to his nose but couldn't smell anything.</p><p>"Wear these sachets. Inside is a powder refined from a certain spiritual flower. We can't smell it, but to some of the venomous insects in the forest, it's like a foul stench to us, something they avoid at all costs. It not only masks our scent, deceiving their perception, but also repels them."</p><p>After Xiang Yi explained the use of the sachets, everyone promptly attached them to their waists.</p><p>……</p><p>A quarter of an hour later.</p><p>Everyone was hiding beneath the sprawling roots of an ancient tree, not daring to breathe loudly, only peeking out cautiously through the gaps between the roots.</p><p>Strangely, apart from them and the ancient trees, there were no other living creatures in sight.</p><p>They had already ventured deep into the forest, where the high branches and dense foliage blocked out the light.</p><p>'Buzz…'</p><p>A buzzing sound suddenly came from the distance.</p><p>"The Jade-Green Bees are coming! Don't make a sound, and absolutely do not use your divine sense!"</p><p>Xiang Yi's warning echoed in their minds.</p><p>Everyone held their breath, and soon, through the gaps, they saw a large mass of green light flying out. As it approached, they realized the green light was composed of countless tiny points of light, like a swarm of green fireflies.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, these were not fireflies at all, but a swarm of ferocious venomous bees!</p><p>These bees were slender, entirely jade-green, and transparent, even their wings. They resembled green gemstones and looked quite beautiful from afar. Their name, Jade-Green Bees, was also pleasant-sounding.</p><p>But a closer look revealed a less appealing sight. The bees had a狰狞 appearance, with long, sharp stingers, like demonic creatures, sending chills down one's spine.</p><p>The Jade-Green Bees had incredibly keen senses and could even detect the fluctuations of divine sense from afar, instantly going into a frenzy.</p><p>According to Xiang Yi, there had been instances where even peak Core Formation cultivators were unfortunately surrounded by several swarms of Jade-Green Bees and left with no remains. These bees were among the most feared venomous insects in the forest.</p><p>Xiang Yi had somehow sensed a swarm of Jade-Green Bees approaching, and in the rush, everyone had to hide beneath the tree roots.</p><p>They weren't truly afraid of this swarm of Jade-Green Bees, but in this perilous forest, it was best to avoid unnecessary trouble.</p><p>The Jade-Green Bees flew closer and closer.</p><p>Qin Sang got a clear look at their appearance.</p><p>It was said that even the Sorcerer Tribe cultivators couldn't explain what kind of insect the Jade-Green Bees had evolved from.</p><p>Qin Sang's mastery of insect control was no less than that of the Sorcerer Tribe cultivators. He frowned in thought for a moment but couldn't think of any type of spiritual bee that matched the Jade-Green Bees' characteristics.</p><p>The Seven Kills Palace was isolated from the world, and the creatures within had undergone unknown changes, the Jade-Green Bees being just one example.</p><p>'Buzz…'</p><p>The Jade-Green Bees flew past a nearby ancient tree.</p><p>After they disappeared, everyone's expression relaxed. They silently left the tree roots and quickly moved away from the dangerous spot.</p><p>Xiang Yi seemed quite familiar with this place and had a clear objective. Except when forced to take cover from danger, he moved forward in almost a straight line.</p><p>The forest was vast, and the environment constantly changed. Despite their caution, they still nearly stumbled into a field of man-eating flowers.</p><p>Along the way, they encountered two wooden huts, but the treasures in these outer areas had clearly been looted.</p>
