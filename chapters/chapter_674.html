<h1>Chapter 666: Six-Petaled Butterfly Violet</h1><p>After waiting a while, the female cultivator returned with the herbs Qin Sang needed, bringing good news.</p><p>"South of Pingbo Port, there's a place called Black Gold Mountain. Legend says there's a fissure deep within the mountain range, containing earth-煞 energy. However, Black Gold Mountain is very chaotic and unsafe.  Senior, please be extremely cautious…"</p><p>The female cultivator handed Qin Sang the herbs and a detailed map, kindly reminding him.</p><p>Qin Sang received the map and found that Black Gold Mountain wasn't far from Pingbo Port, lying on the edge of its sphere of influence.  With all-out effort, he could reach it in seven or eight days.</p><p>Going back and forth, plus the time needed for corpse refinement, wouldn't delay the departure of the Qiongyu Trading Company.</p><p>Black Gold Mountain is vast and unclaimed. While some Wu tribes have a presence nearby, none are particularly powerful.  With caution, he wouldn't need to worry about being ambushed.</p><p>"Thank you for your trouble," said Qin Sang.</p><p>Carefully putting away the map, Qin Sang examined the herbs.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang discovered that while many herbs had been obtained, several of the most valuable ones listed, including Soul-Guiding Grass, were missing entirely.</p><p>"Are herbs in the Canglang Sea really this scarce? Such a large trading company, possessing even magic treasures, yet lacks Soul-Guiding Grass?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, complaining, "Was the Daoist friend afraid this cultivator couldn't afford the spirit stones?  The absence of Wan Shi Zhang is understandable, but not a single Soul-Guiding Grass?"</p><p>Seeing the anger in Qin Sang's tone, the female cultivator was startled and quickly said:</p><p>"Senior, please allow junior to explain.</p><p>"In the Canglang Sea, the rarest are herbs that aid cultivation. Soul-Guiding Grass happens to help demonic cultivators cultivate.  Countless years ago, the outside world's supply was completely swept away by demonic cultivators.</p><p>"Not only does our company lack it, even top trading companies under the East Pole Alliance would only have a chance of finding one.</p><p>"While you can now use beast-derived ingredients to refine some cultivation-assisting pills, their effects are ultimately inferior to naturally grown herbs, and lack such potential side effects. To this day, demonic sects are still actively collecting these herbs, with top trading companies having close ties to them.  As soon as a herb is discovered, it's bought up before news even spreads…"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, feeling increasingly troubled.</p><p>Demonic beast cores in the Canglang Sea aren't so rare. With ample Soul-Guiding Grass, he could refine more Flying Night Rakshasas. Though his spiritual sense limits the number he can control at once, they’d still make good cannon fodder in dangerous situations.</p><p>Without Soul-Guiding Grass, there are no Heaven Corpse Talismans, and no refined living corpses.</p><p>Without living corpses, there are no Flying Night Rakshasas.</p><p>While it doesn't affect煞 corpse refinement, at his level, even煞 corpses refined by False Core cultivators are insufficient, not even qualifying as cannon fodder.</p><p>Unfortunately, he only possesses the first half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*.</p><p>"Until I find more Soul-Guiding Grass, I need to conserve these three Heaven Corpse Talismans. At least one should be kept in reserve,"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>The incident with Ya Gu made Qin Sang realize that the Heaven Corpse Talismans offer at least a sliver of hope. If such a situation arises again, he wouldn't be helpless, watching his friends die.</p><p>The female cultivator secretly observed Qin Sang, noticing his expression soften slightly.  She breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>She secretly guessed that Qin Sang’s eagerness to find Soul-Guiding Grass meant he was a demonic cultivator?</p><p>It was said that Soul-Guiding Grass was most effective for Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators, but she wondered if he was collecting it for a junior or cultivating some demonic art that required this herb.</p><p>Besides Soul-Guiding Grass, the most troublesome was a herb called Six-Petaled Butterfly Violet.</p><p>This herb is used in a formula for cultivating Sky-Eyed Butterflies.  The quantity isn’t large, but it's crucial.</p><p>Most of the herbs required in the formula were bought from the Sihai Trading Company. But without the Six-Petaled Butterfly Violet, the effect will be significantly reduced, slowing the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's growth.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang learned from the female cultivator that the Six-Petaled Butterfly Violet isn't a cultivation-aiding herb like Soul-Guiding Grass.  It’s not as heavily contested and could still be found with careful searching.</p><p>After paying the spirit stones, Qin Sang left the Sihai Trading Company. Instead of rushing to the Qiongyu Trading Company, he found an inn and rented a small courtyard.</p><p>Closing the barriers, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, taking out the 煞妖 pills.</p><p>The 煞妖 pills were five-colored, but due to their creation from demonic beasts, all had a faint layer of blood-red. Opening the jade bottle, a pungent stench filled the air, far more foul than Foundation Establishment pills.</p><p>Qin Sang endured the stench, observing them for a moment before swallowing them.</p><p>This was a low-grade demon-killing pill, heavily saturated with demonic energy – perfect for Qin Sang's purpose.</p><p>The pill entered his body, transforming into an extremely violent medicinal force that surged wildly, crashing into his dantian.  Fortunately, Qin Sang's spiritual energy had already transformed into true essence, incredibly dense and resistant, rendering the pill's power ineffective, causing only minor ripples.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on his Purple Mansion. A faint but intensely malevolent demonic aura, fiercely aggressive, surged towards his primordial spirit the moment the pill was ingested. Even with his strength, he couldn't prevent it.</p><p>No wonder so many cultivators from the Canglang Sea suffered from this demonic energy.</p><p>As expected, upon nearing his primordial spirit, the demonic energy was instantly repelled by his Buddha's light, lingering in his Purple Mansion before reluctantly retreating and accumulating in his physical body.</p><p>Perhaps mixed with the resentment of the beast at its death, the demonic energy was incredibly stubborn, filled with malice and aggression.</p><p>Qin Sang tested it. As long as it didn't invade his primordial spirit, the demonic energy in his body was not difficult to remove and wouldn't cause significant harm.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang also possessed a faint demonic aura, useful for deceiving his opponents.</p><p>…</p><p>The Qiongyu Trading Company's shop was unremarkable. Qin Sang sat in the main hall for a while before a female cultivator, of similar cultivation level (early Nascent Soul stage), hurried in.</p><p>Despite her high cultivation, she wasn't like other female cultivators who prized beauty; her appearance and attire were ordinary. Yet, her every move exuded the unique aura of a high-level cultivator, commanding attention.</p><p>"I apologize for keeping you waiting, Daoist. I am Ran Luo. May I ask your honored surname?"</p><p>Facing a cultivator of equal level and a high-ranking member of the trading company, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't be discourteous. He stood up, cupped his hands, and said, "I am Qingfeng, Daoist. I apologize for the intrusion, Daoist Ran."</p><p>Ran Luo smiled faintly, subtly observing Qin Sang without asking him to remove his cloak.  She said calmly,  "There was a minor incident on the ship.  Daoist Qingfeng's visit is most welcome.  This place is too public; perhaps we can discuss it further in a private room upstairs?"</p><p>"I would be honored."</p><p>Ran Luo gave some instructions and led Qin Sang upstairs.</p><p>"Is Daoist Ran the chief manager of your esteemed company?" Qin Sang curiously asked.</p><p>Ran Luo shook her head. "I am unworthy of such a position.  The manager assigned to Pingbo Port is Elder Zou. He is currently away visiting the Houtu Sect. I can handle some matters in his absence. If Daoist Qingfeng must see Elder Zou, I estimate it will be about half a month before he returns."</p>
