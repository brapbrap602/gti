<h1>Chapter 1990: The Great Zhou</h1><p>A streak of遁光 (escaping light) flew out from the mountains, approaching and revealing a man. Possessing the cultivation of the Nascent Soul stage, he remained composed even when facing Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>"This humble one is Chu Wenxuan. Greetings, Sect Master Ying…"</p><p>Chu Wenxuan greeted everyone one by one, his gaze finally landing on Qin Sang.</p><p>"This poor Daoist is Qing Feng, invited by fellow Daoist Gu Yun叟 to observe the ceremony," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Chu Wenxuan didn't inquire further. "We have arranged for Senior and the other esteemed Seniors to rest at Guqing Peak. Would this be agreeable to Senior?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Everyone immediately followed Chu Wenxuan, flying over the mountain range and arriving at a verdant peak.</p><p>These mountains, aside from slight variations in the types of vegetation, shared similar scenery.</p><p>Abundant spiritual energy, lush greenery as far as the eye could see, it was truly refreshing and difficult to discern any significant differences.</p><p>This was likely a deliberate arrangement by the Jitian Sect to avoid dissatisfaction and resentment due to unequal arrangements.</p><p>As the precious light subsided, everyone retracted their flying artifacts and descended to the front of the mountain.</p><p>Near the summit were several conspicuous ancient trees.</p><p>Through Chu Wenxuan's introduction, Qin Sang learned that each ancient tree was a Treasure Garden, serving as residences for distinguished guests.  Surrounding the Treasure Gardens were numerous caves of varying sizes, scattered across the landscape.</p><p>Guqing Peak was more than sufficient to accommodate several sects.</p><p>The Treasure Gardens were largely similar, and Qin Sang casually chose one. Since he only brought Tai Yi and Yu Lang along, he allowed them to cultivate within the Treasure Garden as well.</p><p>Standing before the Treasure Garden, Qin Sang activated the jade talisman in his hand. The space before him distorted, revealing the true appearance of the Treasure Garden.</p><p>The crown of the tree was like a magnificent canopy. A wooden pavilion was built against the tree. Upon closer inspection, one would discover that the pavilion wasn't man-made, but rather formed by the twisting and intertwining branches of the ancient tree itself.</p><p>The wooden pavilion was nestled beneath the canopy yet didn't obstruct the view. Qin Sang ascended the pavilion and gazed at the boundless expanse of green mountains.</p><p>Tai Yi and Yu Lang rested below.</p><p>A short while later, the Treasure Garden's restrictions were triggered. Tai Yi and Yu Lang came up and requested, "Lord Emissary, fellow Daoist Yun Xi is outside, inviting us to explore."</p><p>Several major sects were participating in the Jitian Grand Assembly, and Gu Yun叟 and the others needed to negotiate with the Jitian Sect to arrange the subsequent affairs.</p><p>Qin Sang had nothing to do and was waiting for news from Gu Yun叟.</p><p>This was an opportunity for Tai Yi and Yu Lang to broaden their horizons, and Qin Sang naturally wouldn't stop them.  With a flick of his finger, he shot a bolt of lightning towards Tai Yi's forehead, leaving a lightning mark between his brows.</p><p>This lightning mark could conceal Tai Yi's origins.</p><p>The Jitian Sect strictly forbade fighting amongst the participating cultivators. Both righteous and demonic sides were arranged in different locations, deliberately separated.</p><p>No one wanted to cause trouble during the Jitian Grand Assembly.  Generally, there wouldn't be any danger here, but there were always exceptions.</p><p>Tai Yi's origins were unique, a spirit talisman gaining sentience and cultivating into a Dao. Qin Sang didn't want him to be targeted by those with ulterior motives and stir up any trouble.</p><p>After his concealment spell, even if others sensed Tai Yi's unusual nature, they would only assume he was some special kind of demonic cultivator.</p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand. After the two left, he didn't enter meditative cultivation. He sent a transmission talisman to Gu Yun叟 and left the Treasure Garden alone.</p><p>Peculiar peaks stood tall, connected by vine bridges. The mountain formations formed a unique city.</p><p>Qin Sang followed a vine bridge, leaving Guqing Peak, occasionally hearing bursts of laughter and playful chatter.</p><p>More flying artifacts continued to enter the city.  The number of people on the mountaintops increased, excitedly commenting on the various sects' flying artifacts and discussing the world.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't so bored as to join them. He had just inquired about the city's layout from Chu Wenxuan and was preparing to go to a place called Lingbao Peak.</p><p>Lingbao Peak was where the major merchant guilds gathered.</p><p>After the Grand Assembly began, an auction would be held there.  It was rumored that treasures that could even tempt Void Refinement cultivators might appear.</p><p>Qin Sang had long arranged for Gu Yun叟 to secure him a seat. This time, it wasn't to participate in the auction but to take the opportunity to peruse ancient texts and gather information about the cultivation world.</p><p>Lingbao Peak was the highest peak in the city, extremely conspicuous.</p><p>Its four sides were sheer cliffs, rising straight up. Ancient trees grew unevenly on the cliffs, with "lanterns" hanging down from their crowns, arranged in rows, some even larger than houses.</p><p>These lanterns were jade-white, as if carved from white jade, emitting a soft, elegant light.</p><p>Between the lanterns, and between Lingbao Peak and the surrounding peaks, vine bridges of varying thicknesses connected them, forming a dense network.</p><p>These ancient trees were a special kind of spiritual tree, and the "lanterns" were their flowers.</p><p>The petals were incredibly hard, with hollow interiors. Cultivators carved these flowers into pavilions and halls, the doors and windows adorned with exquisite patterns.</p><p>Shops were opened within these flowers.</p><p>It was now dusk, and as darkness gathered, the lanterns on Lingbao Peak swayed, becoming even more enchanting.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang ascended Lingbao Peak, his goal clear, crossing several bridges.</p><p>"Jinshu Pavilion…"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced up.</p><p>Jinshu Pavilion sold various cultivation methods and texts, claiming that they were all jade and brocade books, hence the name Jinshu Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't here to buy cultivation methods. He wanted texts that recorded anecdotes of the cultivation world, preferably ancient texts passed down from antiquity.</p><p>Inside the flower chamber, the furnishings were no different from elsewhere.</p><p>A beautiful attendant came forward. After learning of Qin Sang's intentions, she led him to a quiet room, served him fragrant tea, and brought various jade slips and books.</p><p>Batches of jade slips and books were brought in one after another. Qin Sang completely lost track of time, flipping through them, discerning the truth and falsehood of the information, and pondering what he needed to do during this Jitian Grand Assembly.</p><p>His primary goal was naturally the Small Cave Heaven, but he couldn't do much directly, leaving it to Gu Yun叟 to manage.</p><p>One Panlong Sky Pillar basically guaranteed a seventy percent chance of success. But to ensure absolute certainty and avoid any unexpected obstacles, he needed to consider all aspects.</p><p>Next was the Star Essence Infusion.</p><p>If he could find a Void Refinement cultivator specializing in the Star Dao, Star Essence Infusion wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>On the way here, Qin Sang specifically inquired with Gu Yun叟 and the others, learning that there were no sects or powerful cultivators renowned for the Star Dao in Yuedu Bay. He could only consider other options.</p><p>Then there was gathering information about the cultivation world and planning his future journey.</p><p>When he first heard the name "Yuedu Bay," Qin Sang thought it was a bay located on the edge of a continent.</p><p>After a detailed understanding, he learned that in some people's eyes, Yuedu Bay was just an island.</p><p>This "island" was far vaster than the continents of the Small Thousand Worlds!</p><p>But in the vast Grand Thousand World, Yuedu Bay was merely an insignificant island.  This was unimaginable in the Small Thousand Worlds.</p><p>It was named Yuedu Bay because the island's shape resembled a bay.</p><p>To the east of the island, the sea indented into the land, with two peninsulas extending outwards, as if a large chunk had been excavated, forming a bay-like terrain.</p><p>Yundu City was located in the southern part of Yuedu Bay, considered a relatively barren area.</p><p>The most prosperous location was naturally where the Jitian Sect was situated, roughly in the center of Yuedu Bay.  Traveling directly east from the Jitian Sect would lead to the bay.</p><p>From the terrain alone, it was evident that the Jitian Sect's influence could radiate to both the north and south.  All the sects in Yuedu Bay had to heed the Jitian Sect's will.</p><p>Beyond Yuedu Bay were countless small islands, also inhabited by mortals and cultivators, with countless sects of varying sizes. They were considered the peripheral forces of the Yuedu Bay cultivation world and weren't qualified to participate in the Jitian Grand Assembly.</p><p>Based on their performance over the years, the Jitian Sect didn't seem to have ambitions to unify Yuedu Bay, but that didn't mean other sects could disregard them and cause chaos in the cultivation world.</p><p>The Jitian Grand Assembly was more like an alliance meeting, proclaiming the Jitian Sect's authority and balancing the interests of all parties.</p><p>Even before the Grand Assembly began, there was already an air of confrontation.</p><p>Beyond Yuedu Bay was a boundless ocean, with other cultivation worlds existing around it.</p><p>After breaking through to Void Refinement, Gu Yun叟 had traveled extensively, visiting Lusong Island south of Yuedu Bay.</p><p>Traveling east could lead to a place called Chenyu Sea.</p><p>…</p><p>These cultivation worlds, each possessing strength and scope comparable to Yuedu Bay, were separated by vast stretches of sea. Although there was contact between them, the immense distance, the various dangers along the way—demons, evil cultivators—made travel exceedingly difficult, even for Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Traveling with Sect Master Yu, Sect Master Ying, and the others, they shared some of their experiences and generously provided several different cartographic maps.</p><p>The situation at sea was constantly changing, and after a single closed-door cultivation session, the information on a cartographic map might be outdated.  Relying entirely on these maps could lead to one's demise without even knowing how.</p><p>The purpose of the maps was to indicate directions and mark the locations of major forces.</p><p>These cartographic maps shared a common characteristic: their depictions of the area north of Yuedu Bay were more detailed compared to other regions.</p><p>Qin Sang saw that north of Yuedu Bay were Qifeng Island, Jitian Peak, and so on.</p><p>At the northernmost point recorded on the map, the markings were reduced to a small dot. It was impossible to tell the exact distance or the number of dangers that lay between. Naturally, contact between Yuedu Bay and that region was minimal.</p><p>Such a vast distance, and yet it still hadn't reached land.</p><p>Qin Sang also noticed another characteristic: the further west from Yuedu Bay, the sparser the markings became.</p><p>Regarding this, Qin Sang inquired with Gu Yun叟 and learned that back then, Gu Yun叟 was also quite curious and had traveled westward alone. He discovered that the further west he went, the more desolate it became. Eventually, time constraints forced him to return after a brief exploration.</p><p>Most Yuedu Bay cultivators traveled north, with closer ties to the northern forces.</p><p>When he first met Qing Yuan, Qin Sang had asked him about his location and how to reach Yu Jing Mountain.</p><p>Qing Yuan couldn't provide Qin Sang with a detailed route, only giving him a general direction and a brief introduction to the human race.</p><p>Combining this with the rumors he had heard recently, Qin Sang formed a general impression of the human race in the Grand Thousand World.</p><p>Most of the legends circulating in Yuedu Bay were hearsay, but some aligned with what Qing Yuan had said.</p><p>Yu Jing Mountain was the land of dragons, the sacred ground of the human race.  Since ancient times, it had always been the core and spiritual symbol of humanity.</p><p>There stood the Immortal City of Bai Yu Jing, also the first and greatest Immortal City of the human race.</p><p>At the same time, Bai Yu Jing was also the capital of the Great Zhou!</p><p>Indeed, it was hard for ordinary people to imagine, but the human race had an immortal kingdom, named the Great Zhou.  Since Yu Jing Mountain became the sacred ground, the Great Zhou had existed.</p><p>The Emperor of the Great Zhou was the ruler of all under heaven, residing in Bai Yu Jing, ruling with minimal intervention, and leading the human race of the Grand Thousand World.</p><p>Although Qing Yuan didn't elaborate in detail, Qin Sang imagined that the Great Zhou's rule wasn't as strict as that of the mortal world.</p><p>Outside of Yu Jing Mountain, the human forces were divided into eight Celestial Provinces: Qian, Kun, Xun, Zhen, Kan, Li, Gen, and Dui, corresponding to the eight trigrams.</p><p>The eight Celestial Provinces weren't strictly arranged according to the Bagua.</p><p>According to Qing Yuan, the eight Celestial Provinces and Yu Jing Mountain were separated by vast, unimaginable distances, with desolate wilderness in between, like a natural moat.  Ordinary cultivators, even from the capital of one province, couldn't reach other provinces or Bai Yu Jing in their lifetime.</p><p>The journey was fraught with unimaginable dangers that even Void Refinement cultivators wouldn't dare to traverse alone.</p><p>The eight Celestial Provinces and Yu Jing Mountain were connected through Great Teleportation Formations.</p><p>As long as Qin Sang reached the capital of any of the eight Celestial Provinces, he could travel to Yu Jing Mountain through the Great Teleportation Formation.</p><p>Using the Great Teleportation Formation was costly and had stringent requirements, but compared to physically traversing the Grand Thousand World, it was undoubtedly much simpler.</p><p>Most of Yu Jing Mountain and the eight Celestial Provinces were located on land.</p><p>According to Qing Yuan, traveling north from here was the shortest route and would eventually lead to land.</p><p>If he didn't lose his way, he would most likely land on the border of Gen Province.</p><p>Among the Bagua, the Gen trigram represented mountains, and Gen Province was known for its numerous peculiar mountains.  This was the only information Qin Sang knew.</p><p>Qing Yuan didn't travel south from Gen Province but from another location, crossing the sea. Therefore, he couldn't tell him which route was safe.</p><p>Texts were brought in one after another, then taken away.</p><p>Unknowingly, it was already past midnight, and the sky outside gradually brightened.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in the quiet room, continuing to read.</p><p>After finishing the ancient texts of Jinshu Pavilion, Qin Sang didn't leave immediately. He asked the shopkeeper to bring in the ancient texts from other merchants as well.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang also bought some cultivation methods and secret techniques that interested him.</p><p>At the Void Refinement realm, any problem that could be solved with spirit stones wasn't a problem.</p><p>As far as he knew, Void Refinement cultivators, upon reaching a certain level of cultivation, could manipulate spiritual energy and create spirit stones with their hands.</p><p>The purity of the spirit stones depended on the cultivator's cultivation level and their control over the world's Yuan Qi.</p><p>His ability was still lacking. Even if he forcibly created one, it would have impure spiritual energy, making it not very valuable, and it would require considerable effort.</p><p>Based on his judgment, even at the peak of Void Refinement, forging a top-grade spirit stone wouldn't be easy. He didn't know if Body Integration cultivators could achieve it.</p><p>Therefore, for Void Refinement cultivators, only top-grade spirit stones held value.</p><p>At this realm, there was no universally recognized "currency." Transactions were based on bartering, relying entirely on one's own judgment.</p><p>The restrictions were triggered.</p><p>The steward brought in another batch of ancient texts, followed by an attendant who served the finest spiritual tea.  Not daring to disturb Qin Sang, they quietly retreated.</p><p>He had lost count of how many batches it had been. Jinshu Pavilion catered to every request of this generous patron.</p><p>To gain a deeper understanding of the cultivation world around Yuedu Bay, he would definitely need to interact with Void Refinement cultivators later on.  The information he obtained from them would be the most reliable.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang found quite a bit of useful information by browsing through these numerous texts.</p><p>North of Yuedu Bay, islands were scattered like stars. Those large islands comparable to Yuedu Bay generally had top-tier forces presiding over them.</p><p>Separated by the sea, unless under special circumstances, these overlords didn't interfere with each other, coexisting peacefully.</p><p>For now, the cultivation world seemed relatively calm, with no signs of underlying turmoil.</p><p>Picking up the last jade slip, Qin Sang quickly scanned it with his divine sense. The content was unremarkable.  He tossed it aside and pushed the door open.</p><p>The steward was waiting outside. Seeing Qin Sang, his face was wreathed in smiles. "Fellow Daoist Qin, have you finished reading? These are just the treasures of our branch. If you require more, I have already contacted headquarters. However, the texts treasured at headquarters involve secrets that are rather… hehe, so…"</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently, "Have them delivered as soon as possible. When the Grand Assembly ends, this Qin will come to collect them."</p><p>"Ah! Please take your time!"</p><p>The steward's smile grew even wider. He quickly stepped forward and personally escorted Qin Sang out.</p><p>Free to Read. </p>
