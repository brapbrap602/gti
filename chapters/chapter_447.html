Chapter 440: The True Water Thousand Illusions Array


A meteor streaked across the night sky, heading towards the waters of the island.


Those present were all Foundation Establishment cultivators, their eyesight sharp enough to discern the meteor's shape—a flying sword.


The sheer power indicated a Nascent Soul cultivator wielding it!


Whether it was a senior from their side or a rogue from the Skywalk League remained unknown.


A murmur rippled through the crowd.


With so many Golden Core cultivators from Little Cold Region converging, including the island's main and deputy masters, defeat seemed improbable, unless the Skywalk League had deployed a Nascent Soul expert.


Before the person arrived, the voice preceded.


“All False Core disciples! Come forth!”


The booming voice, louder than the approaching sword, echoed from afar.


Relief washed over some faces as they exclaimed joyfully, “It’s Master Di! It’s Master Di's voice! Not the Skywalk League rogues!”


Qin Sang looked towards the source of the sound, locating it to the position of the Illusory Mirage Sect disciples.


It was a Golden Core cultivator from the Illusory Mirage Sect.


The reason behind Master Di summoning the False Core disciples remained unclear.


Could the battle ahead be so fierce as to require the assistance of False Core disciples?


Qin Sang secretly worried; after the False Core disciples, it would be their turn—the late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.  In this situation, escape was impossible.


Teng Zhao Gang's brows furrowed. Disobeying orders was unthinkable; he sighed subtly and turned, saying,  “Junior Brother Qin, Junior Brother Zhan, leave this to you two for now.”


“Senior Brother Teng, rest assured!”


Qin Sang and Zhan Yi bowed, watching Teng Zhao Gang fly out of the crowd with several False Core experts to greet Master Di.


In a flash, Master Di arrived above the waters.


The sword light vanished, the sword disappearing as the middle-aged man sheathed it.


No signs of battle were visible; his expression remained impassive.


Clearly, he was someone who controlled his emotions well, a man of deep cunning.


However, Qin Sang noticed a tear in the corner of the robe Master Di wore.


Master Di hovered in the air, glancing at the False Core disciples, nodding slightly.  With a flick of his wrist, disc-like objects flew from his palm towards Teng Zhao Gang and the others.


“This is one of our Illusory Mirage Sect’s treasured formations—the True Water Thousand Illusions Array. Quickly refine these forbidden artifacts to assist me in setting up the array!”


Master Di's voice carried far, heard clearly by everyone.


Upon hearing the name, Qin Sang looked at the discs.


The Illusory Mirage Sect was renowned in Little Cold Region for their mastery of spirit arrays. He had heard of the True Water Thousand Illusions Array's reputation, supposedly among the sect's most powerful.


The intricate nature of the forbidden artifacts confirmed its power.


The core of the array required Master Di's control; Teng Zhao Gang and the others’ discs were for support.


Unskilled in spirit arrays, Qin Sang had encountered few forbidden artifacts; the most powerful was the Four Cloud Divine Prohibition used by Zhao Yan at the Yuanzhao Sect.


The Four Cloud Divine Prohibition consisted of only four spirit flags and a warm jade as the array eye.  The True Water Thousand Illusions Array was far more complex.


A bold cultivator asked loudly, “Senior Di, why set up the array here? Are we preparing for a great battle with the Skywalk League?”


Master Di surveyed the crowd, pondering for a moment before announcing, “I’ll tell you. The Island Master has decided to relocate Stargazing Island here to confront the Skywalk League. This is just the foundation; the array's power will be enhanced, concerning your safety…”


“Senior Di, how’s the battle going? Have we rescued Senior Fang?”


“Are we going to stay here permanently?”


…


Questions flew from the crowd, creating chaos.


Master Di ignored them, settling in mid-air. Four larger, similar-looking discs appeared before him, humming.  Each disc displayed vortex-like patterns that seemed to come alive, absorbing the surrounding water vapor.


Teng Zhao Gang and the others, following a specific order, each chose a large disc and flew beneath it to begin refinement.


A giant disc, like a bottomless pit, relentlessly consumed the abundant water vapor swirling around it, yet remained unfilled.  This place, deep within the Yun Cang Marshes, was naturally rich in moisture.

In a short time, endless water vapor gathered around the disc, condensing into a tangible form. Even the lake water below felt the vortex's pull, rising as spiraling water dragons.

The disc now resembled four enormous fountains erupting above the Yun Cang Marshes, only the hazy vapor visible, its form obscured.  Teng Zhao Gang and the others, bathed in the vapor, were uncertain of the situation.

Just then, the Di family cultivator finally completed the incantation.  Pausing slightly, he brushed his hand across his pouch, producing a fist-sized orb of liquid.

This liquid, swirling in the cultivator's palm, resembled clear water—colorless and odorless. But when Qin Sang looked closely, he felt an oddly compelling, almost hypnotic quality in its movement.

A sudden warning flared in Qin Sang's mind.  He forcibly broke his gaze, breaking out in a cold sweat, noticing that others around him were similarly captivated by the liquid.

The Di family cultivator poured his spiritual energy into the orb.  It lifted from his palm, rapidly expanding until reaching its limit, then dissipating into a puff of smoke.

A gust of spiritual wind scattered the smoke.  Instantly, the starry sky above vanished, replaced by a heavy, dark cloud cover.

‘Whoosh!’

A furious storm erupted.  Strangely, the raindrops seemed to pass right through them, yet splashed vigorously upon hitting the water.  The surrounding moisture grew even denser.

"A powerful spirit array!" Qin Sang marveled.

The torrential rain intensified, the world plunged into deeper gloom. Outside the array, an impenetrable darkness swallowed everything, obscuring the world beyond.  The extent of the True Water Thousand Illusions Array's influence remained unknown.

Then, Qin Sang heard Teng Zhao Gang's strained voice, "Qin, Zhan, help me…"

Qin Sang and Zhan Yi exchanged a look, inwardly shocked.  Teng Zhao Gang, despite his False Core cultivation and only operating a support disc, was struggling to maintain control.

Without hesitation, they both shot upwards, several others following suit.
