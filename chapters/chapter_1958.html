<h1>Chapter 1949: Retribution with Kindness</h1><p>“Search!”</p><p>Soldiers stormed into the school, and no one dared to stop them.</p><p>Although Mr. Chen was furious, with Yue Duanshu’s official seal and documents present, he didn’t dare to obstruct them using his scholar status. Otherwise, Yue Duanshu would have a legitimate reason to charge him with obstructing official business.</p><p>Yue Duanshu looked down at Mr. Chen with a mocking expression, as if anticipating such a move.</p><p>Mr. Chen’s anger surged, his lips trembled, and his eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>He thought that after years of seclusion in Qippai Village, even repeated exam failures couldn’t shake him. He believed his composure was unyielding, but facing this situation, he realized he was far inferior to his master.</p><p>The officials present were not only Yue Duanshu but also several others, including the magistrate of Jian County.</p><p>In the past, the magistrate had treated Mr. Chen with great respect, even calling him brother when drinking, but today he didn't even greet him, his eyes shifting nervously, avoiding Mr. Chen's gaze.</p><p>The county clerk and other officials behind him were silent, their eyes staring blankly.</p><p>Aside from the inner hall where Mr. Chen’s family resided, the school was mainly divided into two sections.</p><p>The young students were reading in the front room.</p><p>Yulang and the others, having finished their elementary studies, had moved to a bamboo building next to the front room, where the scenery was better.</p><p>At this moment, the front room and the bamboo building were surrounded by soldiers, preventing anyone from entering or leaving.</p><p>The students in the courtyard were herded together by the soldiers; a body search was imminent.</p><p>A group of soldiers rushed to the bamboo building. The students upstairs scrambled to the corners, trembling with fear.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The bamboo door was smashed open, and the soldiers burst in, immediately starting a ruthless search.</p><p>“Bring out all the books! I want to see who Mr. Chen has passed the *Jin Jian Zhai* to! Dare to secretly spread forbidden books – they don’t know what’s good for them!”</p><p>A middle-aged man, looking like a government official, entered, stroking his beard and sneering coldly.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>One book box and bag after another were overturned, with belongings scattered everywhere. The books inside were placed on the table one by one.</p><p>The middle-aged official’s gaze was like a knife, sweeping across the faces of the students. Under his scrutiny, the students’ hearts trembled, and they cowered.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The middle-aged official paced around, feigning inspection of the books on the table, but he headed straight for a bamboo desk.</p><p>Seeing his actions, the girl who had hidden the book couldn’t suppress her terror and let out a scream.</p><p>“It’s not me! I don’t have the *Jin Jian Zhai*! I haven’t read it!”</p><p>“It’s her! It’s Xiao Wu! I saw it in her box; I saw her reading the *Jin Jian Zhai*!”</p><p>“It’s her! Not me!”</p><p>…</p><p>The girl huddled in the corner, pointing at Xiao Wu’s bamboo desk with one finger and clutching her head tightly with the other, shaking her head frantically.</p><p>Her hair was dishevelled; she seemed mad, clearly terrified to the extreme.</p><p>Spreading forbidden books was a serious crime in Yan, potentially leading to execution or even the extermination of three generations.</p><p>She had only heard from a friend that she could find the forbidden book; she couldn’t resist her curiosity and borrowed it to read.  She never expected this to attract the attention of the government.</p><p>The girl didn't have the time to think about the odd circumstances. Even if she implicated someone else, she would still face severe punishment.</p><p>The scream reached the outside. Mr. Chen and the Jian County officers were all stunned.</p><p>Mr. Chen felt as if a bucket of ice water had been poured over him, instantly freezing him.  He was incredulous and instinctively rushed towards the bamboo building.</p><p>‘Slap!’</p><p>Yue Duanshu rode his horse to block Mr. Chen’s path, fiercely whipping his horse and shouting: “Chen Zhenqing, what are you doing!”</p><p>“Are you trying to destroy evidence right in front of me?” Yue Duanshu placed his hand on the hilt of his sword, his eyes filled with murderous intent.</p><p>It seemed that if Mr. Chen took another step, he would draw his sword and kill him!</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Mr. Chen’s eyes widened in rage.</p><p>By now, he could see it was a conspiracy, a plot to ruin his reputation and even kill him!</p><p>Inside the bamboo building.</p><p>The students stared at the girl in shock.</p><p>“Oh? Is it this one?”</p><p>The middle-aged official didn't care who owned the forbidden book. As long as it was found in Chen Zhenqing’s school, or on one of his students, it was enough!</p><p>“It’s her! It’s her!”</p><p>“She’s a Taoist nun; her master is a heretical Taoist from Qingyang Temple, certainly dissatisfied with the government’s control, collecting forbidden books to mislead the people…”</p><p>“That must be it! That must be it!”</p><p>“It’s them!”</p><p>The girl spoke more smoothly, gradually becoming confident.</p><p>This excuse even convinced herself.</p><p>The girl quickly assessed the situation and decisively framed her classmate, showing ruthlessness and decisiveness.</p><p>A middle-aged official smirked, walked around the girl's desk, and reached for Xiao Wu's bookbox.</p><p>…</p><p>In the bamboo forest.</p><p>Xiao Wu hung her head.</p><p>In her hands, there was a yellowed book, the forbidden text "Jin Jian Zhai."</p><p>"Senior Sister…"</p><p>Yu Lang looked at Xiao Wu with concern.</p><p>There weren't many girls studying in the academy. While the Yan Kingdom didn't strictly enforce gender segregation,  boys and girls still maintained a distance to avoid gossip.</p><p>The girl who framed Xiao Wu was Meng Yu Su, one of Xiao Wu's best friends; they had been classmates since their early schooling.</p><p>Being betrayed by a close friend, a betrayal so callous and swift, made Yu Lang feel wretched on his senior sister's behalf.</p><p>"Humph!  People are indeed unpredictable, even at such a young age, such a vicious heart! Don't worry about it.  Just kill her.  In the cultivator's world, deceitful people are countless. You'll encounter them often!"</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi showed disdain. He'd seen far worse things and didn't take this minor incident seriously.</p><p>Xiao Wu could crush all these mortals with a single finger, without needing Qingfeng Daoist's intervention. This ridiculous frame-up wouldn't even bother her.</p><p>Just then, the young man surnamed Shi noticed something unusual about Xiao Wu.</p><p>She sat there, staring blankly at "Jin Jian Zhai" in her hands, completely motionless.</p><p>His brow furrowed, the young man surnamed Shi asked in surprise, "What's wrong? Can't you bring yourself to do it?"</p><p>Yu Lang said with a heavy heart, "Meng Yu Su is Senior Sister's best friend."</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi scoffed, "Think about it, if you weren't cultivators, but ordinary mortals, what would happen today?  Possessing a forbidden book is a capital crime anywhere! Not only would you die, but your junior brother and master would be implicated, publicly beheaded! Whatever feelings you had, they must end. This is a matter of life and death!"</p><p>Yu Lang opened his mouth, unsure what to say.</p><p>Xiao Wu finally raised her head, looking slightly dazed.  She slowly turned her head towards Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>At that moment, there were no patients.</p><p>Qin Sang came out, stood on a rock beside Qingyang Temple, and looked at the bamboo forest below.</p><p>Master and disciple gazed at each other across the bamboo forest.</p><p>Xiao Wu kept her eyes tightly closed, but her eyelids trembled constantly.</p><p>Her expression was full of helplessness. She wanted to ask her master for help, to know what to do.</p><p>But Qin Sang was a harsh master. He watched Xiao Wu silently, offering no guidance.</p><p>At this moment, footsteps approached the temple.  More patients were coming up the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang turned away, walking down from the rock.</p><p>Xiao Wu continued watching until Qin Sang and the patient’s backs disappeared inside the temple doors…</p><p>"In the cultivation world, indecision and leniency are fatal flaws! I don't understand how your Daoist Master taught you!"</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi was puzzled.</p><p>"It seems you only learned tranquility and kindness from your Daoist Master.</p><p>"The so-called Confucian classics you read are all castrated, filled with empty rhetoric about morality and benevolence.</p><p>"Your Daoist Master probably hasn't taught you that the cultivation world demands blood. Suppressing your nature not only hinders your progress but also makes you vulnerable to others.</p><p>"Revenge is a natural law, unchanging since ancient times!</p><p>"Didn't the ancient sages say, 'Repay evil with kindness, how then shall kindness be repaid?'"</p><p>Every word pierced Xiao Wu's heart.</p><p>Xiao Wu's eyelids trembled violently, and scenes flashed through her mind.</p><p>When she first entered the academy, Meng Yu Su was the first to greet her, inviting her to play.</p><p>They studied together, recited poetry together, and received the master's teachings together.</p><p>They played by the river when it flooded.</p><p>Before the New Year, Meng Yu Su invited her home to enjoy delicacies, sharing her treasured possessions.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Yu Su even taught her how to use rouge.</p><p>Xiao Wu had an excellent memory, able to recall every detail clearly. She was subtly changed by their friendship.</p><p>Finally, those memories faded, freezing on a single moment.</p><p>Her master said, "We don't kill, we only save people!"</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A flame erupted from her palm, burning "Jin Jian Zhai" to ashes.</p><p>Xiao Wu burned "Jin Jian Zhai," sat there without further movement, having made her choice.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi fell silent; he'd said enough.</p><p>For some reason, he suddenly felt listless.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi stood up, brushed his clothes, "With your Daoist Master, you'll be perfectly safe, no matter what you do. But you'll understand eventually, hopefully not too painfully."</p><p>With a step, he silently vanished.</p><p>Standing on the hillside, he looked at the bamboo forest, then at Qingyang Temple, finally at the boundless blue sky.</p><p>After a long while, he sighed soundlessly, put on a mask, and disappeared.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the bamboo house.</p><p>"Not here!"</p><p>The middle-aged official shook out the books from the box, but didn't find "Jin Jian Zhai," glaring fiercely at Meng Yu Su.</p><p>Meng Yusu was stunned. She had clearly placed the book in the chest herself; how could it have vanished?</p><p>“Humph!”</p><p>The middle-aged official yanked open Meng Yusu’s satchel.  The book, *Jin Jian Zhai*, was not inside. His expression changed drastically; a sense of foreboding washed over him as he frantically searched everywhere.</p><p>“It’s not here!”</p><p>“It’s not here either!”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The middle-aged official turned the bamboo building upside down, his panic growing, sweat beading on his forehead.</p><p>Footsteps sounded from below.</p><p>A group of officials escorted Mr. Chen upstairs, evidence in hand.</p><p>Yue Duanshu’s face held a smug smile, which instantly froze when he saw the state of the bamboo building.</p><p>Moments later, Yue Duanshu’s furious roar echoed through the building.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Yue Duanshu and his officers stormed downstairs and were about to charge into the inner courtyard.</p><p>“Search the inside!”</p><p>This time, Mr. Chen didn’t back down. He raised a long spear, barring their way, and roared in anger, “Anyone who dares to take a step forward, I, Chen, will fight you to the death!”</p><p>The Jien County magistrate, stroking his beard, his eyes flickering, cleared his throat lightly.</p><p>“Ahem! The Deputy Magistrate’s written order only authorizes a search of the school.  Sir Yue’s intention to disturb Mr. Chen’s family seems inappropriate. I urge you to reconsider!”</p><p>Stepping forward, the magistrate softly advised, “Sir Yue, don't forget that Mr. Chen was a student of Grand Minister Sun.  Although he’s been demoted to Qi Prefecture for many years, it’s said he remains in the Emperor's good graces. If…”</p><p>“Impudent! A tiny county magistrate dares to discuss court matters! How many heads do you have?!”</p><p>Yue Duanshu resembled a gambler who had lost everything, even more infuriatingly, without understanding how he had lost.  His eyes were red with rage, venting his fury on the magistrate.</p><p>Among the soldiers, there were two types of armor. The finely crafted armor belonged to Yue Duanshu’s men; the rest were Jien County soldiers.  Had he not been held back by the Jien County magistrate, with all his men at his disposal, he could have easily fabricated a hundred ways to convict Chen Zhenqing.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Jien County magistrate refused to yield, sweeping his sleeve aside and ordering his soldiers to protect the inner courtyard.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Yue Duanshu finally regained a semblance of composure, staring fixedly at the Jien County magistrate and Mr. Chen.</p><p>“Good! Very good!”</p><p>“The mountain hermit, secretly possessing forbidden books, spreading heretical teachings… bring them in!”</p><p>“No! Master Qingfeng is a righteous Taoist priest, dispensing medicine and saving countless lives, Magistrate…” Mr. Chen was shocked and appealed to the magistrate for help.</p><p>The Jien County magistrate pretended not to hear. He knew Yue Duanshu was acting out of spite and wouldn't offend him further for an unknown Taoist priest.</p><p>A group of officials aggressively approached the Taoist temple and soon arrived at its entrance.</p><p>People inside the temple sensed something amiss.</p><p>Those seeking medicine trembled with fear.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed unfazed, her expression calm as she took a patient’s pulse.</p><p>Just as Yue Duanshu was about to give an order, a thunderous sound of hooves approaching rapidly echoed up the mountain, and someone shouted.</p><p>“Sir Yue! Sir Yue! An order from the Prefect!”</p><p>Everyone looked back and saw a rider galloping towards them, waving a letter.</p><p>The rider’s horsemanship was superb, traversing the rugged mountain path with ease.  In a blink of an eye, he arrived, dismounted, handed the letter to Yue Duanshu, and then searched the crowd with his eyes.</p><p>“This is Mr. Chen, right? I am Qi Yue Ling, I greet you, Mr. Chen!” This person unexpectedly bowed to Mr. Chen.</p><p>“I don’t deserve such courtesy! General Qi, please don’t!”</p><p>Mr. Chen hurriedly stepped aside, then saw Qi Yue Ling lean in and whisper, “You do! You do! Sir, you don't know… the Grand Minister has been reinstated…”</p><p>Though quiet, his voice was loud enough for everyone to hear.</p><p>Yue Duanshu had just opened the letter when his hands began to tremble, his face ashen.</p><p>The Jien County magistrate was overjoyed, almost bursting into laughter. This gamble had paid off!</p><p>Looking at the somewhat dazed Mr. Chen, Qi Yue Ling felt satisfied, glancing at his horse. His devotion to this animal had surpassed even his wife, and it had proven invaluable.</p><p>This trip was truly divinely assisted; a three-day journey had been completed in one day.</p><p>However, he didn't know…</p><p>Down the mountain, the city god and other spirits let out a long sigh of relief, wiping sweat from their nonexistent brows.</p><p>Knowing that these men were targeting Mr. Chen, they sensed danger and immediately sent an urgent message to the city god in the prefecture.</p><p>Fortunately, the prefecture's government issued an order, setting things right. Otherwise, the Jien County spirits would have willingly sacrificed their cultivation to help Master Qingfeng out of trouble.</p><p>To ensure timely delivery of the letter, this messenger had encountered nothing but smooth sailing.  The river god steered the boat, the mountain god guided the horse – true divine assistance.</p><p>The important matter was not delayed.</p><p>(End)</p>
