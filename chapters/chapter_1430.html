<h1>Chapter 1422: The Seal's Transformation</h1><p>Chapter 1422: The Seal's Transformation</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A deafening roar interrupted their conversation.</p><p>Everyone fell silent, their gazes converging on the point where two mountain ranges met.  Crimson flames erupted from the mountain pass.  An incredibly dense aura of crimson fire formed a massive pillar of fire, shooting towards the heavens. On the surface of the mountain pass, a 'd'-shaped seal, resembling a golden tablet, hovered in the void.  A faint golden light covered the entire pass; within, a fiery red glow was intensely striking.</p><p>Even with the seal in place, the crimson flames were creating such a spectacle. It was unimaginable how much terrifying power was contained beneath the seal, struggling to break free.</p><p>The entire Jing Hai Sect was on the brink of disaster.</p><p>*Rumble… rumble…*</p><p>The roars continued, the earth trembling. The mountain pass and the seal were the source.</p><p>At that moment, they clearly saw that the 'd'-shaped seal covering the mountain pass was highly unstable.  The seal itself was rotating, but its speed was slowing, and the power of the seal was visibly weakening.  The seal was beginning to bulge, and the surrounding golden light was dissipating.</p><p>This scene clearly indicated that the seal was about to collapse.</p><p>Even from their distance from the mountain pass, they could feel the incredibly violent power emanating from beneath the seal, making their scalps tingle.</p><p>Seeing this, the expressions of the several Yuan Ying cultivators turned grim. Even without knowing the history and origins of the Jing Hai Sect, the scene before them made it clear: if the seal collapsed, the Jing Hai Sect would vanish from the world completely.  They even suspected that the sect's abandonment and the disappearance of its members were connected to this.</p><p>The excitement in Zhi Jie Zhenren's eyes subsided, and he exclaimed in alarm, "The seal is about to collapse!  How coincidental, we just arrived... Could it be that breaking the formation triggered this change?"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun's eyes flickered constantly.  She was first captivated by the pillar of crimson fire and the mountain pass seal, then seemed to notice something, looking successively at the golden peak, the pagoda, and the protective formation above that they had just passed through.</p><p>Hearing Zhi Jie Zhenren's words, Yu Yi Yuanjun snorted, "Haven't you realized, Daoist Zhi Jie? The 'd'-shaped golden tablet is only one part of it.  All the restrictions within the Jing Hai Sect, including those on the golden peak and the pagoda, and the protective sect formation above, have been forcibly merged by someone with immense divine power, forming a complete seal, their energies interconnected and mutually supporting.  Damaging any part will weaken or even collapse the entire seal…"</p><p>Zhi Jie Zhenren's face flushed. His knowledge of the Jing Hai Sect came from his master. However, his master, Jiu Jie, also knew very little, unclear about the reasons and events surrounding the sect's disappearance.</p><p>At this moment, Hun Mo Laoren, who had remained silent, holding his black bamboo staff, suddenly spoke, "It wasn't forcibly merged. These restrictions were originally connected. The Jing Hai Sect may have foreseen this from the time of its founding."</p><p>His words caused everyone to pause.</p><p>"Your judgment should be correct," Yu Yi Yuanjun's expression grew more serious as she stared at the mountain pass. "Could there be something other than just crimson flames sealed within?"</p><p>Her words sent chills down their spines. The power demonstrated by the Jing Hai Sect's protective formation showed the strength of this Buddhist sect.  Why was such a powerful Buddhist sect so unknown, and why did it suddenly disappear without a trace?</p><p>Zhi Jie Zhenren chuckled nervously, "Let's not guess too much. It's done now, nothing can be changed.  As Yu Yi Xianzi said earlier, Huang Lao Gui gathered several old fellows half a month ago, plotting something unknown in his cave. They've certainly received the news and wouldn't miss this, so they must have entered and are breaking the formation.  Let's get our hands on the treasures first, then deal with the rest. We've expended so much effort, we can't return empty-handed…"</p><p>As he spoke, he stole glances at Hun Mo Laoren.  With Hun Mo Laoren and Yu Yi Yuanjun remaining motionless, he dared not act rashly, only growing increasingly anxious.</p><p>The other two Yuan Ying early-stage cultivators remained silent, but their eyes kept shifting between the golden peak and the pagoda. These two places were exceptional, clearly significant Buddhist sites.</p><p>"If anything goes wrong, it will be up to you all, Daoist friends. Don't let loose some great demon, wreaking havoc on the Wubian Sea. The beauties on my island are all like jade, painstakingly collected, they can't withstand the turmoil."</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun turned her gaze from the mountain pass, her expression languid yet incredibly alluring.  A slight smile played on her lips. "This is a bit different from what the two of you said earlier.  The time we have to obtain the treasures is limited. We can't explore little by little, slowly trying to understand the methods to break the restrictions."</p><p>“Stop wasting time!”</p><p>It’s just a crucible; we’ll get another batch if they die.  </p><p>Chijie Zhenren cursed inwardly.</p><p>Hunmo Laoren tapped his black bamboo staff, his tone indifferent. “Opening the Golden Summit Hall and the Thirteen-Story Pagoda should still be possible. To prevent the seal from collapsing, let’s work together. You choose.”</p><p>Chijie Zhenren and the others were silent.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun asked, “Which will Daoist Friend Hunmo choose?”</p><p>“Golden Summit!”</p><p>Hunmo Laoren uttered the two words softly, his cloudy eyes fixed on the Golden Summit. Ignoring the others, he moved slightly, flying towards the summit.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun giggled, making an unexpected decision. “I trust your judgment, Daoist Friend. The treasures in the Golden Summit won’t disappoint this immortal.”</p><p>The two strongest cultivators both chose the Golden Summit Hall.</p><p>The other three hadn’t expected this.</p><p>Chijie Zhenren almost couldn't contain his surprise.  In a steady voice, he said, “With the Senior and Fairy Yu Yi taking action, success is assured. I shall go to the Pagoda; its restrictions seem weaker.”</p><p>At that moment, the tall cultivator who had remained expressionless and aloof, subtly twitched his ear. He glanced at Yu Yi Yuanjun's back, then murmured, “I will go to the Pagoda as well.”</p><p>The two flew towards the Pagoda almost simultaneously.</p><p>Chijie Zhenren glanced sideways, smiling faintly. “Daoist Sanyin, we must cooperate closely to avoid falling behind the Senior and Fairy Yu Yi and missing the treasures.”</p><p>Daoist Sanyin, a Yuan Ying cultivator, simply nodded.</p><p>Only one remained, hesitant.</p><p>The worry on his face lessened slightly.</p><p>Observing the other four, he couldn’t fathom their relationships.  He knew they weren't as harmonious as they appeared. He wanted to avoid the conflict, but there was nowhere else in the Jinghai Sect comparable to the Golden Summit and the Pagoda.</p><p>Even if more treasures were hidden, by the time he found them, the seal would likely have collapsed.</p><p>After a moment’s hesitation, he stamped his foot and followed Chijie Zhenren and Sanyin.</p><p>The five Yuan Ying cultivators split into two groups.</p><p>Yu Yi Xianzi, half a body length behind Hunmo Laoren, giggled. “Daoist Friend, you can tell me now, why are you really here? I’ll avoid whatever you desire, preventing any unnecessary conflict.  I don't want to end up like those old fellows, dying suddenly for no reason.”</p>
