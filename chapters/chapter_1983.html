<h1>Chapter 1974: Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar</h1><p>White clouds drifted above the battlefield.</p><p>Cultivators, righteous and demonic alike, crowded on one side of the cloud layer.  On the other stood Qin Sang alone, a figure that gave everyone pause.</p><p>This scene resembled less a confrontation between good and evil, and more a standoff between Qin Sang and the multitude.</p><p>Because of Qin Sang's presence, the battle had been overwhelmingly one-sided. Three late Nascent Soul demonic cultivators had fallen in succession to Qin Sang's hand, throwing the demonic forces into disarray.</p><p>The righteous cultivators, however, hadn't seized the opportunity to wipe out the demonic practitioners. Instead, they eyed Qin Sang with apprehension.</p><p>In truth, the cultivation level Qin Sang displayed hadn't surpassed the Nascent Soul realm, yet he exuded an unparalleled pressure.</p><p>Those who had personally clashed with Qin Sang felt it most keenly.</p><p>No matter what Dao Arts or magical treasures they employed, Qin Sang seemed to instantly perceive their weaknesses. He would then use comparable or even weaker force, yet always strike first and break through their defenses with a single move, leaving them scrambling to parry and exhausted.</p><p>Seemingly, his other methods were unremarkable. Qin Sang relied solely on an almost terrifyingly keen insight.</p><p>Even Immortal Cloud and the cloaked figure observing from afar couldn't discern much more.</p><p>Dispatched by their respective powers, both possessed early Deity Transformation cultivation, enabling them to subdue the various factions.</p><p>In their eyes, Qin Sang was indeed a late Nascent Soul cultivator, with no trace of Deity Transformation aura.</p><p>This only deepened their bewilderment.</p><p>How could a Nascent Soul cultivator possess such penetrating insight?</p><p>The cloaked figure said coldly, "This person likely descended from Cloud Metropolis Mountain."</p><p>Mortal affairs are for mortals to resolve.</p><p>The two great powers wouldn't personally participate in this game.</p><p>However, there was no guarantee they wouldn't employ some subtle maneuvers behind the scenes.</p><p>Immortal Cloud scoffed, "Such methods are unnecessary to deal with your demonic ilk! Daoist Qing Feng established the Azure Ram Temple in the mortal realm, dispensing medicine and healing the sick, tempering himself in the world of dust. This old man also learned by chance of a recluse in the Yan Kingdom. To win Daoist Qing Feng over, I invested considerable effort. It's only your misfortune to have missed such a remarkable individual!"</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>The cloaked figure took a long look at Qin Sang, then stepped into the air. The mountain beneath trembled as he tore through the sky and departed.</p><p>They had lost this round.</p><p>Immortal Cloud smiled faintly as he saw the cloaked figure off, then employed a sound transmission technique. "Daoist Qing Feng, would you care for a discussion?"</p><p>The voice reached Qin Sang's ears. Qin Sang nodded slightly and flew towards him.</p><p>His movement instantly caused a stir among the cultivators. The patriarchs of both righteous and demonic sides contemplated deeply, remaining silent and not daring to leave, as if awaiting a final judgment.</p><p>"This humble one is Yun Shan. Greetings, Daoist," Immortal Cloud stood atop the mountain peak, cupping his hands in a carefree gesture.</p><p>"So you are Immortal Cloud? My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>Qin Sang landed gracefully.</p><p>Immortal Cloud demurred, "Many thanks to Daoist for acting righteously, suppressing evil, and deterring the demonic forces!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't reply directly, instead smiling faintly. "This poor Daoist's incompetent disciple, ambitious but lacking in talent, thankfully received the guidance of a noble individual and was spared from becoming the laughingstock of the world. It must have troubled Immortal Cloud greatly."</p><p>Immortal Cloud laughed heartily. "Your disciple is unmatched in righteousness. Were it anyone else, this old man wouldn't have spared them a glance! In the future, your disciple will shoulder great responsibilities for the world. Daoist, you mustn't be too distressed!"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. "Does Immortal Cloud mean the chaotic times are not yet over?"</p><p>"Indeed!" Immortal Cloud said solemnly. "The demonic forces are powerful, disrupting the mortal realm. The gains and losses of a single territory cannot influence the overall situation. There will certainly be times when we must rely on Daoist's assistance in the future."</p><p>Pausing, Immortal Cloud continued, "Daoist's suppression of the demonic entities is a great merit. In the future, when rewards are distributed, Daoist will not be disappointed."</p><p>Qin Sang offered no definite response.</p><p>Immortal Cloud glanced in the direction the cloaked figure had departed. "Daoist's emergence will also be noticed by the demonic forces, making you a thorn in their side. Be extremely cautious in the future!"</p><p>"This poor Daoist is a mere mountain Daoist, never straying far from the Azure Ram Temple.  Let them come if they dare."</p><p>Qin Sang gave a cold smile.</p><p>He wouldn't fear any demons, the more the better! It would be best if more true disciples of the Fallen Soul Abyss came, to thoroughly muddy the waters.</p><p>Then, who could remain a bystander?</p><p>Let them know that this game wasn't so easy to play!</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands slightly, transforming into a streak of azure light that soared into the sky, vanishing without a trace.</p><p>He seemed to have come and gone as he pleased, intervening casually a few times. The victory or defeat between the righteous and demonic factions was of no concern to him.</p><p>He exuded an air of unfettered freedom.</p><p>Immortal Cloud slowly wiped the smile from his face, lost in thought. Even face to face, he couldn't ascertain Qin Sang's true cultivation.</p><p>The mortal realm's spiritual essence was far inferior to that of Cloud Metropolis Mountain and Duskfall Mountain, but occasionally, a Deity Transformation cultivator would emerge.</p><p>Winning over each Deity Transformation cultivator would greatly increase their chances of victory.</p><p>Immortal Cloud withdrew his gaze, looking towards the battlefield. After a moment of contemplation, he flew over unhurriedly to deal with the aftermath.</p><p>Yu Lang had achieved his wish, unifying the Yan Kingdom under his rule. The Yan Kingdom's ruler had accomplished an unprecedented feat.</p><p>From then on, beneath the imperial steps stood not only mortals, but also cultivators.</p><p>However, the war was far from over. The prosperous era Yu Lang desired might be a long time coming.</p><p>…</p><p>Azure Ram Temple.</p><p>Sensing the return of his avatar, Qin Sang's true body's eyelids twitched, withdrawing a portion of his consciousness from the altar.</p><p>Compared to before, the altar beneath him now shimmered with radiant light, imbued with extraordinary mystique.</p><p>The main altar's restoration signified the complete restoration of the entire altar formation.</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood what that Fourth-Order Talisman was.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang had thirstily absorbed everything, marveling at the profundity of the Fourth-Order Talisman and the wonder of the Thunder Altar.</p><p>A Fourth-Order Talisman shouldn't be within the purview of a Void Refinement cultivator, yet Qin Sang could access and comprehend some of its mysteries through the Thunder Altar and the formation.</p><p>It was this Thunder Altar that gave Qin Sang the confidence to face two Void Refinement cultivators!</p><p>Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, his pupils flashing with arcs of lightning, as if two clusters of thunder were embedded within them.</p><p>The sharp gaze gradually subsided, revealing the reflection of the Fourth-Order Talisman in his eyes, a Talisman of Lightning.</p><p>"Huu…"</p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang exhaled deeply, the anomaly in his eyes slowly fading.</p><p>"What a Fourth-Order Talisman! What a Thunder Talisman!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed.</p><p>That power was too formidable, too profound, deeply captivating him to the point of near obsession.</p><p>Every so often, he had to forcibly withdraw his consciousness, fearing complete immersion.</p><p>He blinked, his eyes returning to normal.</p><p>After resting for a while, Qin Sang once again immersed his consciousness in the Thunder Altar, his mind completely focused.</p><p>Regardless of the tumultuous changes in the outside world, the Azure Ram Temple remained tranquil.</p><p>Yu Lang hadn't burned the second bamboo slip, and Immortal Cloud hadn't disturbed him.</p><p>…</p><p>Unknowingly, another five years passed.</p><p>The mortal world underwent further transformations.</p><p>From countless fragmented small nations, larger, powerful nations emerged, standing tall in the human realm.</p><p>A new era of chaos had arrived!</p><p>Azure Ram Temple.</p><p>A slightly hoarse voice broke the silence of the underground chamber.</p><p>"Have they finally discovered it?"</p><p>Qin Sang roused from his meditative state, his gaze piercing through earth and stone towards the north. The piece he had placed on the board had begun to move!</p><p>…</p><p>Fire Domain.</p><p>Qin Sang's former Daoist Abode.</p><p>After Qin Sang relocated his abode, this place had become a desolate lava lake, inhabited only by fire spirits.</p><p>Fallen Soul Abyss and Cloud Metropolis Heaven cultivators occasionally passed through, rarely paying attention to what lay below.</p><p>Prior to this, both sides had already explored countless times, confirming the ruins weren't here.</p><p>On this day, a Cloud Metropolis Heaven cultivator stumbled upon a new discovery.</p><p>This person's Daoist title was Yun Xi, one of the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals.</p><p>Leading several disciples, Yun Xi was originally headed to another location. Passing by this area, he casually activated his Dragon Ring Golden Bell, sweeping it over the lava lake. Unexpectedly, there was a faint reaction from the lake bottom.</p><p>The Dragon Ring Golden Bell was crafted by his sect, a magical tool used to locate the ruins of the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation.</p><p>Shaped like a bell, it earned its name from the dragon-shaped relief on its surface.</p><p>"Ding ling ling..."</p><p>The Dragon Ring Golden Bell emitted an almost imperceptible chime.</p><p>Yun Xi looked down, surprised and delighted. He hadn't expected a hidden ruin to exist here, undiscovered until now.</p><p>However…</p><p>Yun Xi felt hesitant. The Dragon Ring Golden Bell's reaction was too weak.  If he hadn't been a late Deity Transformation cultivator personally activating the tool, he would have certainly overlooked it.</p><p>"Perhaps it's precisely because of this that it has remained hidden for so long."</p><p>Yun Xi thought to himself, calling over a disciple and ordering him to return and report this discovery. Then, he personally led the others down into the lava lake.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The lava, like boiling water, engulfed them.</p><p>Yun Xi deliberately slowed his descent, carefully sensing his surroundings.</p><p>Aside from the somewhat chaotic flow of the earth's fire veins, there was nothing unusual here.</p><p>After descending for some time, logically, they should have been closer to the ruins, yet the Dragon Ring Golden Bell's chime hadn't grown louder.</p><p>Unfazed, Yun Xi continued deeper, following the guidance of the chime, finally arriving near the ruins.</p><p>Lava surrounded them on all sides.</p><p>Yun Xi knew for certain the ruins were hidden within the lava before him, yet the chime remained faint.</p><p>He found this strange, sensing that these ruins must hold some unique characteristic. Cautiously approaching, he meticulously circled the perimeter of the ruins.</p><p>Gradually, he began to understand.</p><p>He personally explored every Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation ruin they excavated. No matter how unique a particular ruin might be, they all shared a common origin, a traceable lineage.</p><p>Without waiting for his fellow disciples, he entered the ruins alone, painstakingly deciphering the restrictions. Seeing the scene within, he finally understood.</p><p>"How chaotic!"</p><p>These ruins were severely damaged. In a few more years, they might be completely swallowed by the lava.</p><p>Just as Yun Xi felt disappointed, thinking there wasn't much of value here, he noticed something unusual.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>He abruptly increased his speed, flying towards the center of the ruins, his eyes widening in surprise at the sight before him.</p><p>"Senior Brother Yun Xi, any discoveries?"</p><p>A familiar voice came from behind. The newcomer was his fellow Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortal, Yun Yuan.</p><p>Following the markers, Yun Yuan had located Yun Xi and simultaneously witnessed the scene ahead, his face etched with astonishment.</p><p>The ancient restrictions here seemed familiar, yet they were far more complex and profound than any they had encountered before.</p><p>Undoubtedly, this place must have once been a crucial part of the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation!</p><p>After observing for a moment, both felt a sense of regret. Although the ancient restrictions here were marvelous, they were severely damaged.</p><p>"Hm? Wait!"</p><p>Yun Xi exclaimed, pointing to a specific point within the restrictions. "Here…"</p><p>"A portion has broken off from here!"</p><p>Yun Yuan cried out at the same time.</p><p>Moreover, both judged that the break wasn't ancient. It likely occurred quite recently.</p><p>The detached portion was highly likely to be incredibly valuable.</p><p>However, the underground lava flowed in all directions, and the presence of the earth's fire veins created extreme chaos below, making it impossible to determine where that portion had fallen.</p><p>"I'll go summon others!" Yun Yuan immediately prepared to leave and gather reinforcements.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Yun Xi stopped him. "Go yourself, and inform only Junior Sister Yun Mi and the others. Order them to come here in secret. Do not alert anyone else!"</p><p>Having only the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals search would be slower, but absolutely trustworthy.</p><p>They absolutely couldn't let the Fallen Soul Abyss know!</p><p>"Understood."</p><p>Yun Yuan didn't hesitate, departing immediately.</p><p>Soon, the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals gathered at the ruins. After meticulous analysis, they dispersed to search.</p><p>They radiated outwards from the ruins, taking turns to appear in other locations to avoid arousing suspicion from the Fallen Soul Abyss.</p><p>After searching for several months, they finally found a seemingly related trace.</p><p>Following the trace, they painstakingly explored, heading increasingly south, gradually entering the desert region.</p><p>Here, the trace became more pronounced.</p><p>Their anticipation grew, and in one fell swoop, they finally found their target.</p><p>Before them lay an underground stone forest, hundreds of stone pillars standing within the lava, forming a peculiar formation.</p><p>"Eh? There's a secret realm here."</p><p>"These reliefs seem to be in the style of a sect that vanished tens of thousands of years ago, called the Radiant Sun Mansion, if I recall correctly."</p><p>"It appears the core fragment drifted here and became trapped within the secret realm…"</p><p>…</p><p>With a few words, they pieced together the situation and immediately began to enter the secret realm.</p><p>With the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals gathered, there wasn't a secret realm in the entire Fire Domain they dared not challenge.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as they navigated the stone forest, breaking through layers of restrictions, a rumbling sound suddenly emanated from the depths of the stone forest.</p><p>The entire stone forest trembled along with it.</p><p>"This aura… Not good! Form the formation!"</p><p>Yun Xi shouted, launching a long spear upwards.</p><p>The Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals each summoned their weapons. Their weapons varied – swords, spears, halberds, and more – yet they all shared the same fluctuation.</p><p>Joining forces, the Cloud Soldier Profound Formation took shape, attempting to envelop the entire stone forest, but it was too late!</p><p>A gigantic wave of lava crashed towards them, carrying terrifying force.</p><p>This fluctuation was all too familiar to them – the fluctuation of the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation's restrictions.</p><p>Clearly, the detached fragment of the ruins had drifted here, colliding with the secret realm and maintaining a fragile equilibrium.</p><p>Their arrival had shattered that balance, triggering an instantaneous eruption.</p><p>Before the eruption, they hadn't detected any anomalies, otherwise they would have been far more cautious.</p><p>Now, they had no time to dwell on such thoughts.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The earth quaked, and wild sand billowed.</p><p>Sand dunes cracked, the earth itself tore open, and underground lava, carrying the force accumulated over countless years, erupted violently.</p><p>The lava喷涌ing high into the sky could be seen from hundreds of miles away, staining the sky crimson.</p><p>The Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals' greatest fear had come to pass. With the eruption of the lava, strange fluctuations spread outwards.</p><p>Within a certain ruin, a true disciple of a Nether Hawk Patriarch abruptly looked up, then vanished in a flash.</p><p>In no time, he appeared near the fissure.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Flame Heart Jade in his hand shone with a light more dazzling than the earthfire!</p><p>…</p><p>"Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar! There's actually a Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar here!"</p><p>At the bottom of the Fallen Soul Abyss, the Black River surged with waves, and a hoarse, ecstatic voice echoed.</p>
