<h1>Chapter 422: The Harmony Pill</h1><p>The restriction in the fire room was triggered.</p><p>Qin Sang gathered his thoughts and looked up, saying, "Come in."</p><p>A young man, whose cultivation was only at the ninth level of Qi Condensation, pushed open the door and entered, his expression respectful. "Greetings, Daoist."</p><p>"It's Zhongming," Qin Sang recognized him, giving him a quick once-over.  He said warmly, "Not bad, not bad.  In a few years, you've already broken through to the ninth level of Qi Condensation. Your future is limitless."</p><p>Zhongming repeatedly claimed he didn't deserve such praise.  Seeing Qin Sang was in the mood for a chat, he was happy to converse. Qin Sang was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and even a casual comment from him could be incredibly beneficial.</p><p>"How is your inner fire?" Qin Sang asked casually.</p><p>Zhongming, without suspicion, extended his right hand, a cluster of Qingyang Demonic Fire illuminating his fingertip. "It's quite stable... there's no immediate danger of it consuming me..."</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang released his spiritual sense, silently investigating the changes in Zhongming's cultivation technique.</p><p>This is how he gathered information on the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>Openly arresting Qingyang Demon Sect disciples in Qingyang Market was impossible.</p><p>He wasn't hasty, patiently befriending Qingyang Demon Sect disciples, little by little uncovering the information he desired.</p><p>With his status as a Foundation Establishment cultivator and renowned artifact refiner, making connections was easy. Few could resist, and his questions weren't detrimental to the Qingyang Demon Sect, so he didn't worry about raising suspicion.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang understood Qingyang Demonic Fire very well.  After learning about the characteristics of Qingyang Demonic Fire and Qingyang Stellar Essence, he felt increasingly that stealing Qingyang Stellar Essence was a hopeless endeavor.</p><p>Qingyang Demon Sect disciples, cultivating Qingyang Demonic Fire, could indeed come into contact with Qingyang Stellar Essence, but bringing it out of Qingyang Sect was almost impossible.</p><p>Qingyang Stellar Essence is essentially Qingyang Divine Energy.</p><p>This is a wondrous thing,  Heavenly Yang Energy, even more dangerous than Earthly Fiend Qi.  Cultivators below the Golden Core stage would tremble just approaching it, let alone have the ability to take it away.</p><p>Of course, there were other methods.</p><p>For example, the Yin Magnetic Bottle can contain Earthly Fiend Qi.</p><p>After years of investigation, Qin Sang had found two special artifacts capable of sealing Heavenly Yang Energy, but they were difficult to refine, especially since the materials were hard to find. The main ingredient was a precious material used to refine magic treasures; the difficulty of gathering it was unimaginable.</p><p>Even if he could refine the artifact, stealing Qingyang Stellar Essence would still be difficult.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect's management of Qingyang Stellar Essence was extremely strict.</p><p>Qingyang Stellar Essence was located on the Divine Energy Peak of the Qingyang Demon Sect, a forbidden area with layers of restrictions and guarded by elders.</p><p>Disciples could enter the mountain to borrow the energy to strengthen their inner fire, but absolutely no one was allowed to collect Qingyang Stellar Essence on their own, not even Foundation Establishment disciples.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect had no Nascent Soul ancestors, only four Golden Core masters in total, one of whom guarded Divine Energy Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang tried a different approach, attempting to refine Qingyang Divine Energy from the Qingyang Demonic Fire.</p><p>Still, it wouldn't work.</p><p>After being refined by the demonic fire, the characteristics of Heavenly Yang Energy in Qingyang Stellar Essence would disappear, becoming 'fuel' to strengthen the demonic fire. This process was irreversible.</p><p>Qingyang Demonic Fire was very special.</p><p>Each disciple's inner fire was different, custom-made by the Qingyang Demon Sect, fusing with the cultivator from the beginning of their training; outsiders couldn't take it away.</p><p>Even if someone from outside the Qingyang Demon Sect killed a disciple and obtained the inner fire, they wouldn't be able to control it.  It would dissipate on its own after a short time.</p><p>The only loophole was that Qingyang Demon Sect disciples could use the demonic fire to seal a trace of Heavenly Yang Energy.</p><p>The problem was, this trace was not only extremely small but also existed for an incredibly short time, not even long enough to leave the Qingyang Demon Sect before dissipating.</p><p>...</p><p>Zhongming brought out two items, a mid-grade spirit sword and a small stone.</p><p>This stone had tiny patterns on it, like stars in the night sky. It was pure silver-white, quite beautiful.</p><p>Its name matched its appearance.</p><p>"Star Square Stone."</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the stone's origin at a glance, looking at Zhongming with surprise.</p><p>The Star Square Stone was a rare earth-element spiritual material.  Adding it to an artifact not only significantly improved it but also allowed it to release countless rays of light, blinding opponents and concealing the artifact itself when activated.</p><p>It was especially practical in low-level cultivator battles.</p><p>Star Square Stones were rare, and the price naturally reflected this.  Unless Zhongming was incredibly lucky, obtaining it by chance, he would likely have spent a fortune to buy even this small piece.</p><p>Zhong Ming looked nervous. "Master, please take a look. Does this spirit sword match the Starstone, and can it be used to enhance it?"</p><p>Zhong Ming's spirit sword was bought from Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang, intimately familiar with her own spirit swords, replied without hesitation, "Of course, but it's quite difficult..."</p><p>Noticing Zhong Ming's nervousness and embarrassment, Qin Sang had an idea. "You'll have some Starstone left over after refining the sword.  If you have no other use for it, consider it payment."</p><p>Overjoyed, Zhong Ming readily agreed, "Thank you, Master."</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang was secluded in the Tian Ge building's fire room, refining artifacts.  After more than half a month, she was interrupted by a message talisman.</p><p>Seeing its contents, Qin Sang's face lit up. She quickly left the Tian Ge building and returned to her 'Sword Pavilion'. There, she found Ning Youwei, a man over fifty, personally serving tea to a young Daoist.</p><p>The Daoist's face was familiar â€“ Li Yu Fu, a disciple of Mingyue!</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Li Yu Fu hastily stood up and bowed deeply. "Disciple greets senior uncle!"</p><p>"Rise."</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed Ning Youwei, helped Li Yu Fu up, and examined him closely.</p><p>Since their last meeting at Cui Ming Mountain, this was their first encounter. Li Yu Fu hadn't changed much, appearing only slightly more mature.</p><p>His cultivation had reached the Foundation Establishment stage!</p><p>This didn't surprise Qin Sang at all.  Li Yu Fu was exceptionally talented, and with Yun Youzi's meticulous guidance, it would have been strange if he hadn't reached this stage.</p><p>"Why are you calling me senior uncle? Didn't Elder Yun Youzi take you as his disciple?"</p><p>Li Yu Fu scratched the back of his neck. "The Grand Master said that although there's a difference between immortals and mortals, worldly traditions must be maintained.  Years ago, the Grand Master personally visited Qingyang Temple, erected memorial tablets for my master and teacher, lectured for a month, establishing Qingyang Temple's lineage, and your name was also included..."</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in acknowledgement. "That's good.  Did your Grand Master send you?"</p><p>Li Yu Fu nodded, then remembered something and quickly took a jade bottle from his pouch.</p><p>Inside was a moon-white spirit pill, emitting a faint immortal aura, incredibly mystical.</p><p>"Senior uncle, this is a Harmony Pill the Grand Master obtained for you. He asked me to bring it. The Grand Master..."</p><p>Li Yu Fu's voice trailed off. He cast a sound-proofing spell before cautiously continuing, "The Grand Master seems to have discovered news of a rare and precious treasure and has gone incognito to investigate..."</p>
