<h1>Chapter 835: The Beast Tide</h1><p>“Die!”</p><p>Revenge was within reach.</p><p>Lady Liu, tears welling in her eyes, cried out.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed his attack, giving Xiang Yi no chance to recover.</p><p>Trapped by the Restriction Talisman, Xiang Yi's true essence stagnated, the power of his magic treasures diminished.  Facing the combined assault of Qin Sang and Lady Liu, he steadily retreated.</p><p>Desperation filled him as he struggled in vain.</p><p>Xiang Yi's defeat was imminent, escape impossible. Just then, the unexpected happened. The Skyeye Butterfly sounded an alarm.</p><p>Qin Sang commanded the butterfly to activate its Skyeye for reconnaissance.  It indeed detected something unusual.</p><p>In the depths of the Demon Sea, waves surged and dark clouds blotted out the sky, rapidly approaching.</p><p>“A Greater Demon!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed dramatically. How could a Greater Demon appear at such a crucial moment?</p><p>The ominous clouds hinted at a massive presence, the exact number unknown.</p><p>No, perhaps this wasn't a coincidence. His battle with Xiang Yi had created a considerable disturbance, likely attracting the demon's attention.</p><p>The Demon Sea was truly perilous now, a veritable dragon's lair.</p><p>Qin Sang lamented.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lady Liu and Xiang Yi also noticed the anomaly.</p><p>Lady Liu, filled with urgency, urged Qin Sang to finish off Xiang Yi quickly.</p><p>Xiang Yi, seeing a glimmer of hope, turned and charged towards the approaching darkness.</p><p>Certain death awaited him here, but within the chaos of the approaching force, there might be a slim chance of survival, or at least the opportunity to drag his enemies down with him.</p><p>However, with the flash of blue lightning, all of Xiang Yi’s plans evaporated.</p><p>Forced to act swiftly, Qin Sang unleashed the Star Conch, aiming for a quick kill and a rapid escape.</p><p>The Star Conch pierced Xiang Yi’s chest, leaving a gaping hole.  An expression of disbelief crossed his face as he looked down at the wound, the light in his eyes fading swiftly before he fell silent.</p><p>Lady Liu, her long-held desire for vengeance finally fulfilled, watched her enemy die. Her legs weakened, as if all her strength had been drained.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly moved to Xiang Yi's body, looting his belongings before incinerating the corpse.</p><p>Unfortunately, the valuable protective robe, repeatedly struck by the Twin-Headed Serpent and the Skyfire Mirror, was completely destroyed.</p><p>“Lady Liu, we must go!”</p><p>Qin Sang urgently called to Lady Liu, who stood motionless, lost in thought.</p><p>Glancing back at the approaching demonic presence, Qin Sang reasoned that their appearance might not be entirely disadvantageous.</p><p>Any remaining traces of their battle would be obliterated by the demons.  Others would simply assume that Xiang Yi had died at the hands of the beasts, eliminating any suspicion towards them.</p><p>Roused by Qin Sang's call, Lady Liu snapped back to reality.</p><p>“Thanks to you, Daoist, this villain is finally dead.”</p><p>Lady Liu murmured, grateful for her wise decision years ago to forge an alliance with him.</p><p>Xiang Yi had been powerful and cunning. Lady Liu suspected that even with another late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, they might have failed to kill him, allowing him to escape.</p><p>Even more alarming was the realization that despite their prolonged fight, Xiang Yi hadn't used his full strength.</p><p>The final, fatal blue light – she hadn't clearly seen the treasure that produced it, but the chilling sensation it evoked remained vivid in her memory.</p><p>*Never offend this Daoist,* Lady Liu thought to herself.</p><p>“Without the Restriction Talisman you meticulously prepared, this wouldn't have been so smooth. I only ask that you keep today's events confidential and not reveal my true abilities…”</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Lady Liu immediately swore an oath of secrecy.</p><p>The two quickly fled, traveling a considerable distance before realizing the demonic presence was still in hot pursuit, growing in intensity.</p><p>“Could this become a beast tide?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered uneasily.  After discussing the situation with Lady Liu, they decided to return to Yuheng Island for help.</p><p>Having dealt with Xiang Yi cleanly, there was no need for them to remain hidden. They could now move openly.</p><p>Neither Qin Sang nor Lady Liu noticed that when Qin Sang unleashed the Star Conch, a panther-like Greater Demon within the dark clouds seemed to catch a scent, its eyes gleaming with avarice.</p><p>Before reaching the island, Qin Sang took a moment to examine Xiang Yi's belongings, ensuring he wasn't carrying anything incriminating.</p><p>Xiang Yi's wealth surpassed even that of the young man from the Western Gloom Alliance. With these resources, Qin Sang could live comfortably for a while.</p><p>Besides spirit stones and other valuables, there were rows of jade slips. Qin Sang initially assumed they contained cultivation techniques and spells, surprised by their sheer number, enough to establish a sect.</p><p>Upon scanning them with his divine sense, he discovered that most contained records of the Merchant Alliance's spiritual materials and their whereabouts.</p><p>Qin Sang considered destroying them but, on a whim, began to examine them closely.</p><p>The contents of the jade slips revealed the immense power of the three great Merchant Alliances. While not all the treasures were exceptionally valuable, their sheer quantity represented a staggering sum.</p><p>The ones in Xiang Yi’s possession were only a fraction, originating from the nearby islands.</p><p>Most of the spiritual materials had been sent to the secure Great Desolation Island, as the Merchant Alliance prepared for future contingencies.</p><p>Qin Sang even saw Soul-Guiding Grass, and not just one stalk, though the Flying Night Devil was no longer of much use to him.</p><p>He searched for Green Withered Root and Scorpion Venom Grass, hoping for a stroke of luck.</p><p>Only major powers like the East Zenith Alliance could amass such a collection of spiritual materials.</p><p>“I found it! Hairy Mountain Vine!”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up.  He had indeed found a record of the Hairy Mountain Vine, also known as Green Withered Root, though only a single one.</p><p>But the following information made his heart sink: "This item has been sent to Great Desolation Island!"</p><p>Xiang Yi was only responsible for transporting these items to Great Desolation Island, unaware of their final destination. Whether the Hairy Mountain Vine was still there remained unknown.</p><p>“I must return as soon as possible and inquire about the Hairy Mountain Vine, find a way to acquire it. I wonder where Old Zou is, and if he can help?”</p><p>Qin Sang had made several acquaintances in the Qiongyu Trading Company, the most influential being Old Zou.</p><p>Lady Liu also had considerable influence. With Xiang Yi dead, their previous connections could be utilized.</p><p>Informed of Qin Sang's intentions, Lady Liu readily agreed to help with the inquiries.</p><p>The two flew towards Yuheng Island without pause, the demonic presence still in pursuit.</p><p>Fortunately, they hadn't delayed in killing Xiang Yi. Otherwise, while Qin Sang could likely have escaped, Lady Liu might not have been so fortunate.</p><p>As Yuheng Island came into view, the dark clouds, now vast and ominous, loomed close behind them.</p><p>The island was clearly aware of the approaching threat. A deep bell resonated throughout the island, alerting all cultivators.</p><p>“Who goes there!”</p><p>Guards immediately intercepted Qin Sang and Lady Liu, demanding identification.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, they are my friends!”</p><p>Jin Ying, who had been waiting for news, rushed forward, revealing her identity.</p><p>As she spoke, she looked at Lady Liu with concern.</p><p>Lady Liu nodded with a smile, and Jin Ying, visibly relieved, suppressed her excitement and led them onto the island.</p><p>Despite Jin Ying's intervention, they still underwent a thorough inspection before being allowed entry.</p><p>Facing the beast tide, Yuheng Island buzzed with activity, the atmosphere tense. All cultivators above the Foundation Establishment stage were mobilized, no one exempt.</p><p>There was no time for pleasantries as they were immediately assigned to defense duties.</p>
