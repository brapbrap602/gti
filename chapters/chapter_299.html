<h1>**Chapter 292: Pathseekers**</h1><p>While flying over the abyss, Qin Sang took a deep look at the battlefield.</p><p>When he crushed the Heart-linked Pendant, he told Yunyouzi and Ge Yuan everything he knew without reservation, and reminded them in particular that Yu Kong intended to lure Luo Xingnan and Shengyuzi to their deaths and had set traps.</p><p>Calculating it, from the time they went into hiding to when Luo Xingnan and his companions appeared, the time in between was not short. Yunyouzi and Ge Yuan had ample opportunity to escape.</p><p>But they didn't do that, but instead chose to follow them in.</p><p>This puzzled Qin Sang and at the same time made him speculate whether they had some kind of life-saving means, which made them confident that they could calmly escape when they encountered danger.</p><p>―――――</p><p>Now it seemed that the situation was not going well.</p><p>There were also many hooksnakes killed by the cultivators. Some of the snake corpses fell into the abyss, and some smashed into the ground. The huge bodies lay sprawled on the ground, and the blood-soaked ground converged into a river, forming strips of blood-colored waterfalls on the edge of the abyss, gurgling and flowing.</p><p>However, the three mid-stage demon spirit hooksnake kings were not among them.</p><p>In the fierce battle, their huge bodies could sometimes be seen being knocked out.</p><p>Their bodies were also scarred, but their aura was not weakened in the slightest, and they immediately charged back in with a ferocious roar, seeming not to know pain at all after falling into madness.</p><p>At this time, the battle in the red fog began to show signs of weakening, and the three strongest hooksnake kings could not be killed.</p><p>Moreover, from beginning to end, no one was able to escape with their lives.</p><p>Yu Kong had originally planned to attack and kill the three when Luo Xingnan and his companions retreated, but in the end, he discovered that the strength of these hooksnakes was beyond expectations, and they didn't need their help.</p><p>Finally, the battle subsided and the red fog dissipated.</p><p>The surviving hooksnakes hovered in the air, their mouths full of blood and minced meat, the madness in their giant eyes not having completely disappeared, and their sharp roars rising and falling one after another.</p><p>The three strongest hooksnake kings were also covered with scars, which showed that the counterattack of the cultivators before their deaths was very fierce. One of them even had its two tails severed, and blood flowed like a thread,发出阵阵哀鸣。</p><p>They seemed to be communicating.</p><p>Afterwards, one of the hooksnake kings dragged its seriously injured companion and flew back into the abyss to sleep, while the others landed on the ground to devour the corpses of their kind, and some flew back to their nests.</p><p>The hooksnake nest was on the back mountain. With the hooksnakes' huge bodies hidden inside, there was not the slightest trace of demonic energy leaking out, which showed that the depth of the nest was probably not inferior to that of the abyss.</p><p>Two mid-stage Foundation Establishment masters, and with a group of helpers, died just like that under the siege of a group of demonic beasts, not one of them survived.</p><p>Except for the five people of Yu Kong watching, no one knew that they had died so silently.</p><p>They used only a small scheme to easily eliminate two major enemies without any effort.</p><p>This result was something that even Yu Kong had not expected.</p><p>They had already approached stealthily and were standing behind the stone mountain, watching this great battle from beginning to end, and seeing such a tragic ending, they couldn't help but be shocked.</p><p>For a moment, there was a silent silence, and no one spoke.</p><p>"Elder Yu..."</p><p>Wu Chen swallowed his saliva and spoke to Yu Kong with respect. The scene just now had shocked him greatly.</p><p>Yu Kong turned his hand and turned into clouds and covered his hand and rain. In an instant, he wiped out so many Foundation Establishment cultivators. No matter how deep his plan was or how vicious his means were, he would not dare to show any disrespect to Yu Kong again.</p><p>"You knew about the existence of these hooksnakes long ago..."</p><p>"This mister Yu does know that there are evil demons lurking, not good to deal with, but I didn't expect these evil beasts to be so strong. This mister Yu originally only intended to spare the lives of those two old guys, but unexpectedly these two villains implicated so many innocent people. After going out, this mister Yu will definitely ask someone to give a grand ceremony for fellow daoists to comfort their spirits in heaven..."</p><p>Yu Kong sighed sadly and compassionately, but there was a hint of smugness on his face that he could not completely hide.</p><p>"However, the great enemy has been eliminated, now the spirit medicine is ours, and by the way, helping us severely injure the guardian demon beast, we can easily escape after picking the medicine. We should be happy, what do you think?"</p><p>Yu Kong's gaze swept over, including Qin Sang, and they all nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Time is running out, and the restriction has not yet been broken. We must leave before the low point of the guardian magic formation disappears. This mister Yu does not want to be trapped in such a place for thirty years..."</p><p>Under Yu Kong's urging, the crowd used their escape techniques and rushed to the distant mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang took a last look at the devastated battlefield, pondered for a moment, and turned and left.</p><p>They were very careful in their行动。The appearance of the hooksnakes was a warning that this place was not as peaceful as it seemed on the surface.</p><p>Beyond these short peaks, other mountains may have their own guardian demons.</p><p>Fortunately, the peaks have always been so peaceful.</p><p>As they got closer, they found themselves breathing heavily.</p><p>Colorful lights penetrated the heavy fog, shot into the sky, and almost blinded them. Qin Sang silently counted them and came up with 21 lights!</p><p>In other words, there were 21 spiritual herbs that were at least a thousand years old!</p><p>Luo Xingnan just made the dramatic statement that he was going to completely focus on preparing to form a Gold Core once they returned, and if he got these 21 spiritual herbs, he might actually achieve his wish.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up slightly, his gaze falling on a location near the top of the peaks where the profound yellow energy was especially bright.</p><p>With 21 spiritual herbs, they should have enough for each of them to get four, as long as Yu Kong didn’t get greedy and decide not to play fair.</p><p>However, the auras of these spiritual herbs varied, with most of them being weak and dim, and only a few were bright and eye-catching.</p><p>The profound yellow energy was one of those three, so that was certainly the most valuable one.</p><p>Yu Kong might not be willing to give it up.</p><p>“Those Black Widows were probably left by the owner of the cave as guardian demons,” Yu Kong nodded slightly, his voice filled with an excitement that he couldn’t hide as he looked at the spiritual herbs. “Break the enchantment and these spiritual herbs will be ours. For this last part, we’ll need to work together!”</p><p>Upon hearing these words, the others reluctantly tore their greedy eyes away from the herbs and looked at the dense fog.</p><p>The enchantment was hidden within the dense fog, and they could already sense a hint of danger before even entering it.</p><p>This enchantment wasn’t going to be easy to break.</p><p>They circled the mountain and tried a few times to find a way up, but the entire mountain was sealed by the dense fog and the enchantment. There was no way up, so they had to give up on that idea.</p><p>“We don’t have time to slowly figure out how to break the enchantment. Luckily, I’ve done some research on enchantments. However…”</p><p>Yu Kong paused and looked at Qin Sang and the other two. “The enchantment here is very complex and powerful. Someone will have to go inside it to activate its power so that we can see the enchantment clearly. I need to focus on finding a way to break the enchantment, so I’ll need you three to take turns going inside. What do you think, or do you have any other ideas?”</p><p>Chapter 292: The Pathfinders</p><p>As they flew over the abyss, Qin Sang took one last look at the battlefield.</p><p>When he crushed the communication amulet, he had relayed everything he knew to Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan, emphasizing Yu Kong's intention to ambush Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi with a trap.</p><p>Considering the time elapsed between their hiding and the arrival of Luo Xingnan's group, Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan had ample opportunity to escape.</p><p>Yet, they chose to follow the group into the abyss.</p><p>This puzzled Qin Sang, leading him to speculate whether they possessed some life-saving measures, granting them the confidence to escape any danger.</p><p>―――――</p><p>Now, it seemed the situation was dire.</p><p>Numerous Hook Serpents lay slain by the cultivators, their corpses scattered, some plunging into the abyss, others crashing onto the ground. Their massive bodies littered the area, staining the ground crimson, the blood converging into rivers that cascaded into the abyss like bloody waterfalls.</p><p>However, the three Spirit Severing middle stage Hook Serpent Kings were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>During the fierce battle, glimpses of their enormous bodies being flung out were occasionally caught.</p><p>Despite their wounds, their auras remained undiminished. With ferocious roars, they would immediately charge back into the fray, seemingly oblivious to pain in their frenzy.</p><p>The intensity of the battle within the red mist began to wane. The three strongest Hook Serpent Kings were simply too resilient to be killed.</p><p>Moreover, not a single person had managed to escape.</p><p>Yu Kong had initially planned to ambush Luo Xingnan's group during their retreat. However, the unexpected strength of the Hook Serpents rendered their intervention unnecessary.</p><p>Finally, the battle subsided, and the red mist dispersed.</p><p>The surviving Hook Serpents hovered in the air, their mouths smeared with blood and flesh. The madness in their giant eyes hadn't completely faded, and their sharp roars echoed.</p><p>The three most powerful Hook Serpent Kings were also heavily wounded, a testament to the cultivators' fierce final stand. One even had both tails severed, bleeding profusely and wailing in agony.</p><p>They seemed to be communicating.</p><p>Then, one Hook Serpent King dragged its severely injured companion back into the abyss to slumber.  Others descended to devour the corpses of their brethren, while some returned to their nests.</p><p>The Hook Serpents' nests were located in the rear mountains.  Given their immense size, the fact that no demonic aura leaked from their nests indicated their considerable depth, likely rivaling the abyss itself.</p><p>Two Foundation Establishment middle stage masters, along with their entourage, had perished in the ambush, not a single survivor.</p><p>Apart from Yu Kong and his four companions, no one knew of their silent demise.</p><p>With a simple ploy, two formidable rivals were effortlessly eliminated.</p><p>Even Yu Kong hadn't anticipated such an outcome.</p><p>Hidden behind a stone hill, they had witnessed the entire battle unfold, from beginning to its tragic end, leaving them deeply shaken.</p><p>Silence hung heavy in the air.</p><p>"Senior Yu..."</p><p>Wu Chen swallowed, addressing Yu Kong with a newfound respect. The previous scene had left him in awe.</p><p>Yu Kong's effortless annihilation of so many Foundation Establishment cultivators, coupled with his cunning and ruthlessness, instilled a deep reverence in Wu Chen.</p><p>"You knew about these Hook Serpents all along..."</p><p>"I was indeed aware of lurking evil spirits, formidable ones at that, but I hadn't expected such strength from these beasts. I had only intended to spare the lives of those two old geezers, but those villains dragged so many innocents down with them. After we leave, I will surely arrange a grand memorial service for these fellow Daoists, to appease their souls..."</p><p>Yu Kong sighed with feigned sorrow, a triumphant smile playing on his lips.</p><p>"However, with our enemies eliminated, the spirit herbs are now ours for the taking. And they've conveniently weakened the guardian beasts for us, making our escape after collecting the herbs a simple matter.  We should be rejoicing, shouldn't we?"</p><p>Yu Kong's gaze swept over the group.  Everyone, including Qin Sang, nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Time is of the essence. There are still restrictions to break. We must leave before the weakening period of the protective formation ends. I have no desire to be trapped in this place for thirty years..."</p><p>Urged by Yu Kong, the group activated their escape techniques and headed towards the distant mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang cast a final glance at the ravaged battlefield, pondered for a moment, then turned and left.</p><p>They proceeded cautiously. The appearance of the Hook Serpents served as a warning. This place was not as peaceful as it seemed.  The plains were dotted with low hills, each potentially harboring guardian beasts.</p><p>Fortunately, their journey to the mountain remained undisturbed.</p><p>As they drew closer, their breathing quickened involuntarily.</p><p>Multicolored rays of light pierced the dense fog, reaching towards the sky, dazzling the eyes. Qin Sang silently counted them – twenty-one in total!</p><p>This meant there were twenty-one spirit herbs on the mountain, each at least a thousand years old!</p><p>Luo Xingnan had boasted about focusing on his Core Formation preparations after returning.  With these twenty-one spirit herbs, he might actually achieve his goal.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head slightly, his gaze fixed on a spot near the summit, where a distinct profound yellow aura stood out.</p><p>Twenty-one spirit herbs should be sufficient for them to share, with more than four for each person, provided Yu Kong wasn't greedy and wouldn't turn hostile.</p><p>However, the auras of the spirit herbs varied. Most were faint and small, while only a few shone brightly.</p><p>Among them, the profound yellow aura ranked among the top three, indicating its exceptional value.</p><p>Yu Kong might be unwilling to part with it.</p><p>"It seems those Hook Serpents were indeed the guardian beasts left behind by the cave's master," Yu Kong nodded slightly, his voice filled with excitement as he looked at the numerous spirit herbs. "Once we break the restriction, these spirit herbs will be ours.  The final obstacle requires our combined efforts!"</p><p>Hearing this, the others tore their greedy gazes away from the herbs and turned towards the dense fog.</p><p>The restriction lay hidden within the fog. Even before entering, they could sense the faint presence of danger within.</p><p>This restriction was not easily broken.</p><p>They circled the mountain, probing the fog several times, and discovered that the entire mountain was sealed by the fog and the restriction, with no apparent path leading upwards. They had to abandon any hopes of an easy ascent.</p><p>"We simply don't have the time to slowly decipher how to break this restriction. Fortunately, I possess some knowledge in the art of restrictions, however..."</p><p>Yu Kong paused, his gaze sweeping over Qin Sang and the other two. "This restriction is vast and powerful.  Someone needs to enter the restriction and trigger its power, allowing us to see its true form. I must concentrate on finding a way to break it, so I'll have to rely on you fellow Daoists to take turns probing the restriction. What are your thoughts? Do you have any other suggestions?"</p>
