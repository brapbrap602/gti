<h1>Chapter 335: Past Experiences</h1><p>Chapter 335: Past Experiences</p><p>“Qin…”</p><p>Tan Hao opened his mouth, hesitated, and then said, “Tan Hao greets Senior Uncle Qin…”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, suddenly remembering the rules Yue Wu had set when they first entered Kuiyin Sect—seniority determined brotherhood, and whoever broke through to the Foundation Establishment stage first would become a senior uncle, just like him.</p><p>Thinking back, it was so ridiculous.</p><p>Anyone who chose to cultivate with the Yama Banner would never reach Foundation Establishment.  Yue Wu’s words were all lies!</p><p>Qin Sang said helplessly, “Brother Tan, do we need to be so formal with each other? Kuiyin Sect is gone, the past is like a dream bubble, we are both free now, why bother with those so-called sect rules? Just call me Brother Qin.”</p><p>Actually, in Kuiyin Sect, Qin Sang was the junior disciple; the Tan brothers had entered earlier and were his senior brothers.</p><p>Given their current difference in cultivation, Tan Hao certainly wouldn't dare call him junior brother.</p><p>“Brother Qin…”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang say this, Tan Hao’s expression relaxed.  The past friendship added a touch of warmth to his tone,  he said gratefully, “Thanks to meeting Brother Qin, otherwise I would be a ghost under that villain's control now.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head indifferently. “Brother Tan, you misunderstand. It wasn't a chance encounter; I followed you. Your mask is quite powerful; I couldn't see through your identity.  I thought you looked familiar at the auction, and when I heard your voice in the secret market, I felt even more familiar. When I noticed someone was tracking you, I followed to see who it was, and unexpectedly, it was you.”</p><p>“So Brother Qin was also at the auction and the secret market. My shameful behavior was also seen by Brother Qin.”</p><p>Tan Hao smiled sheepishly, revealing the mask.  “I obtained this by chance. It’s said to be made from the skull of a late-stage spirit beast, and it can disguise one’s aura as a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>As long as you don't fight, you won't be exposed.</p><p>Thanks to this mask, I could survive in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield for all these years.</p><p>However, every time I use it, I must use all my spiritual sense to maintain it. My physique is different from ordinary people, so using other artifacts to conceal my figure is impossible, which is really frustrating…”</p><p>Compared to their first meeting in You Shan Market, Tan Hao had undergone a drastic change.</p><p>Back then, he was a righteous man who fearlessly spoke his mind, not afraid of offending anyone.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to hold a banquet to express his gratitude, but Tan Hao flatly refused, stating that he acted according to his own will and didn't seek any reward.  Tan Jie had to help smooth things over, showing his youthful arrogance.</p><p>Now, although Tan Hao's appearance remained rough, his words and actions were very cautious, without any impropriety. His mind had become much more delicate and shrewd.</p><p>He must have gone through many hardships over the years.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly and curiously asked, “Brother Tan, Kuiyin Sect suffered a sudden catastrophe.  I luckily escaped and thought I would never see you again, but I didn't expect to meet you today. How have you been all these years? Have you joined another sect? And…why wasn't Tan Jie with you? Did you brothers get separated?”</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's question, Tan Hao's eyes dimmed. He looked around and said, “This isn’t the place to talk. I have a cave dwelling outside Yinshan Pass. Brother Qin, if you don't mind, come with me to my cave dwelling, we can talk as we walk.”</p><p>Qin Sang had no objections.</p><p>The two of them flew towards Yinshan Pass.</p><p>“Back then, you and Senior Sister Shi Hong both broke through to the sixth level. Shi Hong was taken as a disciple by Yue Wu, but you disappeared. Yue Wu said you went to work in the outer sect, and we never saw you again until Kuiyin Sect was destroyed…”</p><p>Tan Hao recounted Qin Sang's departure from Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, calmly saying, “That’s right.  Senior Sister Shi Hong and I went to see Senior Uncle Yue Wu.  Shi Hong was favored by Senior Uncle Yue Wu because of her talent. The rest of us, because our talents were inferior, were sent out of the sect.</p><p>Actually, Yue Wu was lying. We weren’t doing administrative work, we were sent on dangerous missions under threat by the sect master.</p><p>Fortunately, I was outside the mountain at the time and wasn't affected by the Yuanzhao Sect's counterattack. When I realized something was wrong, I chose to escape, and that's how I managed to escape from the clutches of Kuiyin Sect.”</p><p>"I heard that the Yuanzhao Gate launched a major counterattack and now occupies the main gate of the Kuiyin Sect. I wonder what it was like back then, and how did you escape?"</p><p>Tan Hao glanced at Qin Sang, a hesitant look on his face. He didn't answer Qin Sang's question but asked hesitantly, "Brother Qin, since you've left the Kuiyin Sect and become a Foundation Establishment cultivator...did you later dispel your cultivation and start anew, or did you never use the Yanluo Banner to cultivate?"</p><p>"It seems, Brother Tan, you've also noticed something is wrong with the Yanluo Banner."</p><p>Qin Sang had been waiting for Tan Hao to ask this question and immediately countered.</p><p>Although Tan Hao hadn't broken through to Foundation Establishment, he had surpassed the tenth level of Qi Refinement.  Not being refined into a spirit tool, he must have discovered the secret of the Yanluo Banner.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang knew that after leaving the Kuiyin Sect, Tan Hao hadn't joined another sect but had remained a lone cultivator, venturing into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>If Tan Hao had dispelled his cultivation and started anew, to return to the thirteenth level of Qi Refinement shows incredible perseverance. Qin Sang admired his tenacity.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Tan Hao chuckled bitterly, revealing something that surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>"It wasn't I who discovered the Yanluo Banner's secret, but my younger brother, Tan Jie.  When we first entered the Kuiyin Sect, Tan Jie was suspicious of the Yanluo Banner. But later, he found that the entire sect used the Yanluo Banner to cultivate, so he thought he was overthinking it.  Using the Yanluo Banner to cultivate must be dangerous, but the Kuiyin Sect has so many Foundation Establishment cultivators, it couldn't all be fake. And the Yanluo Banner's allure was too great. As they say, great fortune lies in great risk. We couldn't bear to give it up. After discussing it, we made a decision. He was always clever and perceptive, quick to notice anomalies and adapt.  So he used the Yanluo Banner as an aid. I continued cultivating as before. That way, if something truly went wrong, we still had a chance. And as long as Tan Jie could reach Foundation Establishment, my cultivation resources wouldn't be a worry.  Since then, fearing discovery by the Kuiyin Sect, I rarely left my cave abode, and Tan Jie handled everything. If only I had known, I would have gladly switched places with Tan Jie!"</p><p>Tan Hao recounted this with a mournful tone, his voice filled with sorrow and regret, moving Qin Sang deeply.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, recalling his time at the Kuiyin Sect.  No wonder he rarely saw Tan Hao in those years.  Yue Wu held monthly lectures, yet Tan Hao hadn't attended a single one.  He'd assumed Tan Hao was diligently cultivating, but there was more to it.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Tan Hao's face and softly asked, "I wonder about Brother Tan Jie now..."</p><p>Since Tan Jie chose to cultivate with the Yanluo Banner, and he wasn't here now, only Tan Hao remained.</p><p>Could it be that he...</p>
