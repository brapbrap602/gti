<h1>Chapter 1247: Blood Souls</h1><p>Chapter 1247: Blood Souls</p><p>The basin was far from calm; waves of mist gathered and dispersed, shifting endlessly.  </p><p>But this was normal. Any anomalies were obscured by the blood mist and ancient prohibitions.</p><p>Fat Chicken waited for Qin Sang's decision.  It knew its cultivation was insufficient; venturing alone, it would quickly perish.</p><p>He looked at the blood sea, then at the note.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered briefly, then entered the basin with Fat Chicken. He chose a direction consistent with the note but maintained a distance from the marked route.</p><p>The feeling, aside from the absence of blood shadows, was much like the Blood River.</p><p>"So cold!"</p><p>Surrounded by malevolent energy, Fat Chicken shivered.</p><p>The deeper they went, the colder it became, even more intense than the Blood River, affecting their consciousness.</p><p>By the basin's bottom, Fat Chicken was struggling, only recovering after Qin Sang enveloped him in his true energy. He gazed at the boundless blood mist with lingering fear.</p><p>"The ancient prohibitions here aren't too troublesome, but deeper in, I can't fully protect you. Inside, you'll return to the Heart Ring. Every so often, I'll find a safe spot and let you out to use the Thunder Bead."</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>Fat Chicken needed to use its innate ability, triggering the thunder power in its bloodline, to activate the Thunder Bead and sense its mother.</p><p>This ability was unique to the Thunder Hawks; unless its mother was trapped within a pocket dimension, ordinary prohibitions couldn't block their connection.</p><p>Therefore, only Fat Chicken could use the Thunder Bead, not Qin Sang.</p><p>This was cumbersome, but there was no other way.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.  The blood mist concealed a landscape of rubble and devastation.</p><p>It was as desolate as the Blood River's bottom, barren and lifeless.</p><p>The earth resembled a torn chessboard, crisscrossed by ravines spewing blood mist and malevolent energy.</p><p>Its survival to this day was a miracle.</p><p>There must have been incredibly powerful seals here, now shattered. The remnants of the ancient prohibitions, enduring countless years, remained incredibly dangerous.</p><p>Fat Chicken huddled behind Qin Sang, shrinking at the sight.</p><p>Terrifying!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the path Qing Jun and the others took, then moved forward.</p><p>The ebony sword flew from his brow, suspended above his head. The Eighteen Demon Banners were hidden in his sleeve, thunder flashing on his wings, poised for action.</p><p>After a short distance, the ebony sword suddenly shone, slashing a curtain of sword energy.</p><p>Then Qin Sang and Fat Chicken retreated quickly.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>As soon as they moved, a gust of dark wind blew, pulverizing the stones where they had stood. The sword curtain blocked the remaining force.</p><p>This happened several times.</p><p>Qin Sang navigated between the gaps in the ancient prohibitions, handling unexpected events without major incident.</p><p>Unknowingly, they had walked for several hours.</p><p>Except for necessary meditation, Qin Sang hardly stopped.</p><p>The basin was vast and perilous, necessitating a slow pace.  They still had some distance to the center.</p><p>Throughout their journey, they hadn't seen another soul.</p><p>By now, cultivators from both realms had been inside for a while. Qin Sang hadn't sensed anything, nor had the Thunder Bead received any feedback.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang sensed something, stopping abruptly, his gaze fixed on the left.</p><p>Fat Chicken followed his gaze, seeing only dense blood mist, confused.</p><p>"Get in!"</p><p>At Qin Sang's command, Fat Chicken quickly retracted the Thunder Bead, hiding in the Heart Ring.</p><p>The next moment, a piercing shriek, tearing through the eardrums, echoed.</p><p>The sound was like demonic incantations. Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Then, a surge of intense blood light flashed from the depths of the blood mist, revealing a figure like one clambering from a blood pool, floating in mid-air, menacingly attacking.</p><p>The shriek was earsplitting, full of malice, a bloodthirsty demon.</p><p>"Not a blood shadow, a humanoid... Could it be a Blood Soul born from the blood mist?"</p><p>This Blood Soul was the only living thing he'd encountered.  He'd expected blood shadows like those in the Blood River, not a humanoid.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang saw a flash of blood light, the Blood Soul incredibly close.  Startled, he attacked with his sword.</p><p>'Slash!'</p><p>The ebony sword cleaved the Blood Soul from top to bottom, dismembering it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after a sword strike, the severed blood soul writhed, and two new bodies grew from the halves, transforming into two bloody figures!</p><p>“Immortal?”</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his spirit sword.  With a flick of his sleeve, a ball of demonic fire shot out, expanding and contracting into a fiery net that enveloped the two blood souls.</p><p>But even this couldn't kill them. They shrieked and struggled wildly, the demonic fire fluctuating violently.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly launched two more balls of demonic fire.</p><p>As the blood souls appeared about to be incinerated, Qin Sang was about to reduce the fire, intending to examine them, when his Sky Eye Butterfly suddenly gave a warning: a dozen more blood souls were approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang made a swift decision and burned the blood souls to ashes.  Nothing remained after their deaths.</p><p>He moved swiftly, putting distance between himself and the location.</p><p>Those blood souls were incredibly fast and relentlessly pursued him.  It was difficult to escape in this area, so Qin Sang fought his way through them until he eliminated every last one.</p><p>Having dealt with the blood souls, Qin Sang looked towards their origin, a hesitant look on his face.  “It seems only that one place has these blood souls. If I’m surrounded, I’ll be in a difficult position. That's the route my senior sisters and the others chose. Could something have happened to them?”</p><p>He considered going to check.</p><p>But if even Qing Jun and the Tongyou Demon Lord couldn't handle it, going alone would be like walking into a lion's den.</p><p>The basin was more dangerous than he'd imagined.  Qin Sang grew more wary.  He encountered a few more lone blood souls, but they posed little threat.</p><p>After traveling for a while, Qin Sang had just killed another blood soul when he heard a voice.</p><p>“I wonder who the cultivator is?”</p><p>Qin Sang secretly summoned his eighteen demonic banners. The voice was ethereal, impossible to pinpoint. The speaker had clearly used some concealment technique.</p><p>He activated his Sky Eye ability, but still couldn't locate the person.  However, besides his senior sisters and their group, only the  Cultivators of the Abyss were in the area. The voice sounded somewhat familiar.</p><p>“Could it be Daoist Si?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked tentatively.</p><p>“Eh? Daoist Mingyue!”</p><p>The other person exclaimed, their tone surprised and delighted. Then, the blood mist churned in the distance, and a figure flew through the air – Si Di, his partner from Sandie Pass.</p><p>“We waited a long time and thought you might be in trouble.”</p><p>From Si Di’s tone, it seemed he’d entered with Qing Jun and the others, but for some reason, he was the only one left.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  “I shouldn't be much later than you all.  But traveling alone here is troublesome, so I fell behind. Why are you alone here, Daoist friend?”</p>
