Chapter 701: Aroused Interest


Qin Sang said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoist Fan, you transmitted a message in the market saying you knew a route through the Thousand Demons Sea. You aren't trying to trick me into coming here, are you?"
The cultivators present had all seen Qin Sang inquiring about this information in the market and were not surprised.
The stout cultivator laughed, "Fellow Daoist Qin, don't worry. Your condition is actually the simplest, not even a condition at all. This cave dwelling was something I stumbled upon on that very route. Before we enter the Thousand Demons Sea, I'll give you the map..."
"Thousand Demons Sea!"
"The cave is in the Thousand Demons Sea?"
"Do you know how dangerous the Thousand Demons Sea is now?"
...
Everyone was startled and began to clamor.
The stout cultivator raised his hand to quiet them down. "Everyone, please calm down. Although the cave is in the Thousand Demons Sea, it's far from where the evil cultivators gather. You all know that the recognized route is close to the southernmost point of the Thousand Demons Sea, and that's where the evil cultivators are most rampant. This cave, however, is at the northern end. With such a distance, those notorious evil cultivators, who haven't gained much power in such a short time, wouldn't dare risk provoking the two races by extending their reach there..."
After repeated confirmations, everyone accepted the stout cultivator's explanation.
For a time, silence fell upon the island.
The stout cultivator didn't urge them, his expression clearly very confident.
Qin Sang was weighing his options. He was already leaning towards agreeing. Both the Nascent Soul treasure and the route were worth the trip.
The cultivators chosen by the stout cultivator were, without exception, early Core Formation cultivators. Although they were all outstanding, Qin Sang was confident in himself. Even if he couldn't defeat them, no one could catch him.
At this moment, Qin Sang heard the scholar in blue transmit, "Fellow Daoist Qin, have you made up your mind?"
Qin Sang calmly replied, "Has Fellow Daoist Lan decided to agree to Fellow Daoist Fan's proposal?"
"Indeed!"
Unexpectedly, the scholar readily agreed. "The treasures Fellow Daoist Fan presented aren't fake. If he intended to harm us, destroying three supreme treasures would be absurd. What worries me the most is whether Fellow Daoist Fan is hiding something about the Cold Mist. Also, after breaking the restriction, if the treasures are too valuable, with human nature being what it is, I fear something unbearable might happen... I wish to form an alliance with Fellow Daoist Qin. What are your thoughts?"
Qin Sang frowned slightly and lowered his head in thought.
The scholar added, "Look at the others, Fellow Daoist. I suspect they have similar thoughts. I don't know any of them, but I met you first, Fellow Daoist Qin, and felt you possessed an extraordinary aura, hence my proposal..."
Qin Sang looked up and saw the two female cultivators had naturally gravitated towards each other.
The other three, including the stout cultivator, were moving their lips, communicating with each other.
At this time, others also transmitted messages to Qin Sang. He perfunctorily responded to each one, finally transmitting back to the scholar, "Alright. If we encounter danger, we can help each other..."
After a while,
After the two female cultivators finished their discussion, the one who had spoken earlier asked the stout cultivator, "Fellow Daoist Fan, when do you plan to depart? Could you give us a few days to discuss and make some preparations?"
The stout cultivator chuckled. "Don't blame me for being cautious, Fellow Daoist, but the treasures are valuable, and I must be careful.  Give me your answer now, whether you're going or not, and we'll depart immediately. If you can't decide now, I can't wait for you. We'll part ways, as if we've never met."
The female cultivator's eyebrows furrowed. She nodded and whispered something to the other female cultivator. The two seemed to be arguing.
Perhaps it was a case of skill emboldening courage.
Of the six people invited by the stout cultivator, Qin Sang and four others readily agreed. The last one, a dark-faced, large man, was clearly hesitant. He transmitted messages to the stout cultivator for a long time before reluctantly agreeing.
Seeing this, the stout cultivator was overjoyed. He clapped his hands and stood up, saying, "Let's not delay any longer. We'll travel through the night, preferably without stopping. It will be arduous for everyone."
They were all Core Formation masters, so traveling for several days continuously wasn't a problem.
Seven streaks of light rose from the island one after another. Qin Sang and the others followed behind the stout cultivator, flying into the air and speeding away.
Qin Sang didn't want to expose his Sword Qi Thunder Sound and Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, and he didn't have any flying magical treasures, so he had to use a flying artifact to travel.
Fortunately, the other cultivators were similar to Qin Sang.
The journey was smooth.
After several days of monotonous flight, everyone gradually became acquainted. Out of boredom, they began to exchange their cultivation experiences, and Qin Sang benefited greatly.
Returning the favor, Qin Sang shared some of his insights.
His most impressive skill was swordsmanship.
Having obtained the Sword Qi Thunder Sound and Sword Light Splitting divine abilities from the cultivation method, Qin Sang himself never slackened. Especially in the years immediately after forming his core, when he couldn't cultivate peacefully, he constantly studied the Way of the Sword.
His aptitude was inferior to those swordsmanship geniuses, but with the aid of the cultivation method, after a long period of contemplation and comprehension of the Way of the Sword, he had gained some insights, and his swordsmanship far surpassed that of ordinary cultivators.
With these years of accumulation, coupled with the improvement in his cultivation, Qin Sang felt that it wouldn't be long before he could comprehend Sword Qi Thunder Sound on his own.
At that time, he would be able to enter this realm of swordsmanship through his own abilities and wouldn't have to rely on the Ebony Sword. Even if the Ebony Sword was temporarily unusable, he could still use the technique.
However, comprehending Sword Light Splitting was still a long way off.
But Qin Sang wouldn't be discouraged. Having the cultivation method to guide him, showing him the direction, he was much luckier than others.
The atmosphere among the seven was very harmonious. After more than ten days of continuous flight, they were approaching the Thousand Demons Sea. At this point, everyone became extremely vigilant, no longer flying carelessly, and cautiously approached the area.
"Fellow Daoist Fan, can you take out the map now?"
Finally arriving at the northern end of the Thousand Demons Sea, Qin Sang asked impatiently.
The stout cultivator took out a piece of animal hide. "It seems Fellow Daoist Qin is anxious. The map is right here. Take a look, everyone."
Qin Sang took it and saw that it was a nautical chart hand-drawn on some kind of animal hide. At the north and south ends of the Thousand Demons Sea, there were two winding routes clearly marked, traversing the entire sea.
Surrounding the Thousand Demons Sea was the even more dangerous vast Demonic Sea, teeming with demonic beasts, rarely ventured into by cultivators. Fortunately, the location where the Fire Sparrows appeared was near the Thousand Demons Sea, and it wasn't far after crossing it.
Qin Sang quickly memorized the nautical chart and passed it to the others.
"Why isn't the cave marked?"
The thin old man frowned and questioned.
The stout cultivator smiled faintly. "The route doesn't mean it's absolutely safe. My escape technique isn't great, and I'm afraid you might leave me behind if we encounter danger. Allow me to keep it a secret for now. Also, I obtained this chart by chance from a friend, and not many people know about it. It's best if you don't spread it around casually in the future, lest it become common knowledge, which wouldn't be ideal."
