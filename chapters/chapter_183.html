Chapter 176: Five Elements Yin Thing


"Three spirit eyes, yet no spirit springs?"
Qin Sang uttered in disappointment.

The restricted area of the Heaven Corpse Sect's branch was extremely large, and the treasure vault for storing treasures was also built here. To their surprise, there were actually three spirit eyes coexisting within the restricted area.

The spirit vein occupied by the Heaven Corpse Sect was much smaller than the Shao Hua Mountain Sect, and it was normal to have a spirit eye, but there were actually three spirit eyes, and they were so close to each other that it would not be an exaggeration to call it a God-made cave.

But to Qin Sang's disappointment, even though there were three spirit eyes here, the richness of the spiritual energy faintly surpassed his cave, but no spirit springs were born.

If there was a spirit spring, he would have moved it back no matter what.

After breaking through the second level of the 'Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter', the difficulty of comprehending the killing rune increased sharply. Even understanding each stroke was more difficult than the entire first killing rune. The sooner he went to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the better.

Hearing Qin Sang's complaints, Yu Daiyue, who was studying the array artifact, lifted his head and laughed at his wishful thinking, "Junior Brother Qin, you've thought too much. It's already a blessing from heaven and earth for a spirit eye to be formed on a spirit vein. How can spirit springs be so easily born? Our sect has been established for a long time, but we have only attracted six spirit springs. It is not because the spiritual energy is rich or the spirit vein is vast that spirit springs can be born. It must be harmonized with the mountains and rivers, and it must also gather the beauty of all directions. Only under various coincidences is there such a slight possibility."

"Does Senior Brother Yu have much research on spirit springs? Can you tell me about it in detail?"

Qin Sang asked curiously. He had been to Pagoda Peak and found that there were very few relevant records. Hearing Yu Daiyue's tone, he seemed to have studied it carefully.

"Junior Brother Qin is really interested in this?"

Yu Daiyue was a little surprised. Hearing Qin Sang mention Pagoda Peak, he said: "Junior Brother Qin, if you're looking for these records on Pagoda Peak, you've come to the wrong place. The records of spirit veins, spirit eyes, and spirit springs are most numerous, not on Pagoda Peak, but on Dao Sect Peak."

"Dao Sect Peak?"

Qin Sang was stunned.

"That's right," Yu Daiyue nodded, "Dao Sect Peak has a library, which stores many classics passed down from the mortal world, and some writings written by cultivators, but they are not very valuable and are of little use to us cultivators. Therefore, not many people know about it. Before I broke through to the Foundation Building stage, I worked as a handyman on Dao Sect Peak,整理着里面的典籍, and discovered that many mortal classics are also very interesting, so I became obsessed. I wasted a lot of time on this, and only broke through to the Foundation Building stage when I was nearly fifty years old, almost delaying my important matters. There are some jade slips in the library that collect the works of cultivators who specialize in Feng Shui, and some of them talk about spirit springs. Junior Brother Qin can go and have a look. Financial resources, dao companions, methods, and places are all necessary treasures for cultivators. It is said that a fad of searching for spirit springs once rose in the cultivation world. Later, cultivators discovered that spirit veins were easy to find, but the formation of spirit springs had no规律, and spirit springs were too rare. The cultivation methods they studied could not be verified at all. When the fad died down, these works gradually became unpopular and were all thrown into Dao Sect Peak."

Hearing Yu Daiyue's comments on the scriptures of the mundane world, Qin Sang nodded in agreement. Although mortals were like mayflies, living and dying in the blink of an eye, there were countless intelligent people like the sands in the Ganges River. It was just that they lacked spiritual roots, or had no connection with immortals or the immortal path.

The 'Serene and Pure Scripture' he had obtained from Daoist Fasting Heart was a scripture of ordinary Taoists. Not only did it help him enter meditation and cultivate, but he still recited and savored it from time to time.

Qin Sang wrote down the location of the library and decided to go and see if anyone had studied the methods to hasten the maturity of spirit springs after returning to the sect.

The array artifact of the Heaven Corpse Sect was a piece of white jade that was as tall as a person. It was exquisite and flawless, without a single trace of impurities. There were some damaged parts on it, but when the two of them controlled it together, golden threads lit up from the middle of the white jade, and the restriction was still effective.

After the golden threads covered the white jade, a tremendous suction force suddenly appeared. It was as if it had turned into a black hole, devouring the spiritual energy in the restricted area at an alarming speed.

The devouring speed was so fast that a visible vortex appeared above the white jade.

Following this, these golden threads extended beyond the restricted area like a spider web, and they rapidly spread outwards. The cave was filled with golden light, and the cold and gloomy feeling was swept away, becoming warm and cozy.

It could be seen that the purpose of the restriction was indeed to resist the evil spirit energy. The disciples of the Heaven Corpse Sect were able to cultivate in such a place under the protection of the restriction.

After activating the restriction, Qin Sang and Yu Daiyue's anxious hearts finally settled down, and they only needed to wait for the evil spirit energy to recede before leaving this land of chaos.

Out of boredom, the two of them searched through a large area of ruins again, and unexpectedly, they actually found some treasures in the end.

A piece of iron the size of a palm, a few grains of astral sand, some demon beast bones, a small bottle of ghost water, and a piece of golden cedar wood were all excellent materials for refining devices. In addition, there were two damaged magic devices.

The duo laid out the things on the ground. Yu Daiyue waved his hand and said, "Junior Brother Qin killed the evil corpse that was blocking the way. He deserves the most credit. Since I didn't contribute, Junior Brother Qin should choose first."

Qin Sang was honest and unceremonious. He directly picked up the most expensive golden cedar wood. Seeing Yu Daiyue's expression stiffen, he said, "Senior Brother Yu, my younger brother needs the purest spiritual wood to refine the life essence sword, so I won't be polite. However, golden cedar wood is too precious, and my younger brother dare not be greedy. I will also take this bottle of ghost water. The other things will go to Senior Brother Yu. What do you think?"

The value of golden cedar wood and ghost water was slightly lower than the other items. However, Qin Sang needed both of them.

Golden cedar wood needed no explanation. After breaking through the second level of the Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture, Qin Sang realized that the killing talisman was much more powerful than he had imagined. The ebony sword was likely to be unable to withstand the second killing talisman. Preparing spiritual wood in advance was also for a rainy day.

Ghost water was a must-have for refining evil corpses.

The art of refining evil corpses from earth evil spirit energy in the Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture not only required unique secret techniques but also required the cooperation of special spiritual objects, namely, five types of five-element yin objects: nine-orifice stone, blue冥gold, moon locust heartwood over five hundred years old, ghost eagle feathers, and ghost water.

Gathering the five-element yin objects also required a lot of effort. Finding a bottle of ghost water here was an unexpected joy. Qin Sang would certainly not miss it.

Seeing Qin Sang say this, Yu Daiyue naturally had no further objections and accepted the other spiritual objects with a smile. He said, "Junior Brother Qin is actually preparing to refine his own life essence sword, and he requires the purest spiritual wood. The power must be extraordinary. In the future, I can also help Junior Brother Qin keep an eye out."

Qin Sang cupped his hands and said, "Then I'll thank Senior Brother Yu."

After the duo had finished the distribution, they waited patiently in the forbidden area, thinking that there might be other companions alive. They did not close the forbidden area completely.

Unexpectedly, as time passed, the rumbling sound became louder and louder. Soon, a wisp of black gas surged into the hall, extremely cold. However, Li Zai was still nowhere to be seen.

Yu Daiyue sighed deeply and said, "Junior Brother Qin, I'm afraid Junior Brother Li and the others are already in great danger. We should close the restriction, or it will be too late."
