<h1>Chapter 149: Artifact Refining</h1><p>Half a month later.</p><p>Askmoon Market.</p><p>Qin Sang, who was well-acquainted, stepped into Shopkeeper Wu’s shop. Unfortunately, there were already customers in the shop, so he sat down in the distance and waited for Shopkeeper Wu to send the customers away.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin, long time no see. Your cultivation has grown more advanced.”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu walked over enthusiastically and poured Qin Sang some tea.</p><p>“Shopkeeper Wu’s business is flourishing.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and took a sip of tea. He activated the Ethereal Escape Art. How could Shopkeeper Wu tell how deep his cultivation was? It was just a compliment. “I came here today to ask Shopkeeper Wu for a favor. If I give you the corpse of a demonic beast, I wonder if you could refine it into a magic weapon?”</p><p>He had been cultivating in seclusion in his cave dwelling, seldom going out, and he did not know many people. The only person he knew who could refine artifacts was Shopkeeper Wu.</p><p>He had met the man several times in the past, and could tell that he was quite accomplished in the art of artifact refining. Their cooperation had also been quite pleasant, so Qin Sang had come straight to Askmoon Market after returning from the Cloudsea and reporting back to his sect.</p><p>The corpse of a demonic beast in the Demonic Spirit Period could be sold for a good price, but Qin Sang wanted to refine it into several suitable magic weapons to give him more means of self-defense.</p><p>These were the only materials he had, besides the demonic beast corpse, he did not have any other spiritual materials. If he asked a famous artifact refining grandmaster to do it, the price would be very high, but the quality of the artifacts he refined might not be much better.</p><p>“The corpse of a demonic beast?”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu’s expression changed when he heard this, but he still said cautiously, “Fellow Daoist Qin, don’t worry. I wouldn’t dare open a shop in the market if I didn’t have a few tricks up my sleeve. As for what kind of artifacts I can refine, that will depend on what kind of demonic beast corpse it is.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu understood, and got up to close the door of the shop. He then opened the restriction at the entrance and gestured. “Fellow Daoist Qin, please follow me.”</p><p>There was a small courtyard behind the shop, which was not small. The door of the back room was closed tightly, and it was sealed with restrictions. That was probably where Shopkeeper Wu refined artifacts.</p><p>When he arrived in the courtyard, Qin Sang lightly brushed his mustard seed bag with his finger, and a huge beast corpse and several other scattered objects immediately flew out. They landed on the ground with a thud in front of Shopkeeper Wu’s astonished gaze, and the smell of blood filled the air.</p><p>The beast corpse was naturally that of the White Rhinoceros Demonic Beast, but the other scattered objects were just a snake’s tail that was several meters long, two broken venomous fangs, and several palm-sized snow-white scales. Some of them were intact, but most of them had cracks.</p><p>The snake demon was not like the White Rhinoceros Demonic Beast, which had just broken into the Demonic Spirit Period. It had a much higher cultivation base, and its nature was treacherous. The moment it fell into the Netherworld Devil-Subduing Formation, it became alert, and decisively cut off its tail to survive, breaking free from the great formation.</p><p>Moreover, this snake also had the blood of a jiao dragon, and its snake scales were abnormally hard.</p><p>Qin Sang had fought with it fiercely for a long time, wielding the Ebonywood Sword, but he was unable to kill it. In the end, he was only able to use the Thunderstrike Spiritwood to cast the Dark Water Yin Thunder Curse, knocking out the snake demon’s two venomous fangs before it could escape using an escape technique.</p><p>The snake demon was severely injured by this, and it would take more than a decade to recover.</p><p>These scales, venomous fangs, and severed tail were all excellent materials for refining artifacts.</p><p>“A demonic beast in the Demonic Spirit Period…”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu’s voice was dry.</p><p>As someone who was proficient in artifact refining, he could naturally tell that this demonic beast had just died not long ago. Not to mention the fact that he had single-handedly killed a White Rhinoceros Demonic Beast, anyone who could heavily injure a snake demon must have been a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>This meant that Qin Sang had either concealed his strength, or he had a Foundation Establishment cultivator backing him.</p><p>“I happened to come across two demonic beasts fighting, and I took advantage of the situation.”</p><p>Qin Sang said casually, and did not care whether Shopkeeper Wu believed him or not. He could sense that Shopkeeper Wu’s manner had become much more respectful. This was probably not a bad thing, as it meant that he would be able to wholeheartedly refine artifacts for him.</p><p>“One is a White Rhinoceros Demon, and the other is a snake demon with the blood of a jiao dragon. Please, Shopkeeper Wu, take a look and see what kind of artifacts can be refined?”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu took a deep breath, calmed himself down, walked to the demonic beast’s corpse, and examined it carefully for a long time. He then said thoughtfully, “I wonder if Fellow Daoist Qin has any other spiritual materials?”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. The Thunderstrike Spiritwood had to be used with the Dark Water Yin Thunder Curse.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu said with some disappointment, “Artifact refining has always required the assistance of multiple spiritual materials to stimulate their full potential. If you only use demonic beast corpses, then a demonic beast in the early stage of the Demonic Spirit Period would be insufficient. I should be able to help Fellow Daoist Qin refine several medium-grade artifacts. Or, you can choose a main material from the corpse and refine the others as auxiliaries…”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu walked around the demonic beast’s corpse, his fingers constantly pointing at it as he spoke. “The White Rhinoceros Demon’s rhinoceros horn and beast hide can both be used as the main material. The rhinoceros horn is rich in water energy, and can be used to refine an attack magic weapon of the water element. Its power will definitely not be weak.</p><p>It's said that war drum magic treasures are refined by nearly formed rhino skins, which has the power to shake the world, calm the enemy's souls, and can be imitated to refine this treasure, refining war drum magic weapons. In addition, if these two snake teeth are the main materials, it should be possible to refine magic weapons such as poison swords. With these three as the main materials, it is enough to refine an excellent high-grade magic weapon, and there is some hope of breaking through to an extreme magic weapon, but there is also a big difference between extreme magic weapons...</p><p>"Just a top-grade magic weapon?"</p><p>Qin Sang was a little disappointed. He didn't understand refining, and he didn't expect the requirements for refining magic weapons to be so high. He didn't have the energy to travel and look for refining spirit materials.</p><p>The power of the several magic weapons on his body is not weak, especially the ebony sword and the ten directions Yama banner, which are comparable to the strength of the talisman, and he doesn't like top-grade magic weapons.</p><p>It was also after joining Kuiyin Sect that he directly acquired several evil weapons refined by the elder Yi himself, equivalent to the finest magic weapons, and his vision was raised unconsciously, not knowing the hardships of other cultivators.</p><p>For the foundation-building period cultivator, only a few of them have talisman with them. In order to refine a handy top-grade magic weapon, I don't know how long it will take.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu sensed his words and demeanor, and saw Qin Sang hesitating, and quickly said: "If the top-quality magic weapon can't catch Fellow Daoist Qin's eye, I can also refine a one-time magic weapon. Although this type of magic weapon can only be used once, it is extremely powerful. When you are in danger, you can rely on it to save your life. The rhinoceros horn of this white rhinoceros is full of water yuan, and the spiritual power is violent. It is suitable for refining this kind of magic weapon."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and he couldn't help thinking of the bead he had found on Zhao Yan.</p><p>"Is it a one-time magic weapon that can explode like thunder?"</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu nodded, "This is just one of them, and there are also body protection magic weapons. Although they are powerful, few people are willing to spend precious spirit materials to refine magic weapons that can only be used once. Among them, the Void Spirit Sect's Void Sky Thunder is the most famous. It is a powerful treasure that can seriously injure a golden core master. It is the treasure of the Void Spirit Sect and is extremely difficult to refine. I happened to have a method for refining a magic weapon called the Devouring Cone in my family's inheritance. The Devouring Cone refined with this demon corpse will definitely not disappoint Fellow Daoist Qin..."</p><p>Qin Sang noncommittally took out the black pearl from the mustard seed bag and asked, "Fellow Daoist Wu, do you recognize this magic weapon?"</p><p>After he broke through the foundation building, he inspected it many times and confirmed that this pearl was not an evil weapon such as the Chi Long sword, and there was no special refining method.</p>
