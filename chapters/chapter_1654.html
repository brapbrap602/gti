<h1>Chapter 1645: Lotus Throne</h1><p>The herb garden was a matter for later.</p><p>The strange-faced man's legacy was the true prize of this venture.</p><p>A cursory glance revealed quite a few items that made Qin Sang's heart race with excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved some True Essence Replenishing Pills and shared them with his Avatar, restoring their True Essence while he pulled out the strange-faced man's Mustard Seed Bag and began to carefully examine its contents.</p><p>Magical treasures, spirit pills, talismans, and such external objects were few, even scarce, within, not befitting the man's cultivation level.</p><p>For many years, the strange-faced man had devoted himself to cultivating the Gu King, refining his venomous arts, and suppressing the virulent poison within his body.</p><p>Later, with the Gu King's maturation, the acquisition of the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree, and his cultivation of the Postnatal Wooden Man Stele in preparation for opening the Formless Immortal Sect's legacy, he had no spare energy to divert to other pursuits.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense stirred the Mustard Seed Bag, causing several streaks of light to fly out.</p><p>He reached out and grasped a wooden box.</p><p>Opening the box, he found a ball of azure light within.  His divine sense swept over it, and the refining method for the Heavenly Exquisite Jade was imprinted into his sea of consciousness. This secret art, exclusive to the Wooden Aspect Hall, was finally in his possession.</p><p>The refining method was remarkably comprehensive, including insights left by past Hall Masters of the Wooden Aspect Hall.</p><p>Seeing it with his own eyes, Qin Sang realized that refining the Heavenly Exquisite Jade was not as simple as the strange-faced man had made it sound.</p><p>The refiner must first possess profound mastery in the Dao of Artifact Refinement and a cultivation level no lower than late Nascent Soul.</p><p>This treasure aided in reaching Deity Transformation, so its value was self-evident.</p><p>However, anyone wishing to refine the Heavenly Exquisite Jade for trade would still need to carefully weigh the gains and losses, demonstrating the sheer difficulty involved in creating it.</p><p>Refining the Heavenly Exquisite Jade was not an overnight endeavor, and the required spirit materials were all exceptionally rare heavenly treasures. Even Qin Sang, a master artifact refiner, didn't recognize several of them.</p><p>The other streaks of light contained jade slips, some of which held the artifact refinement legacy of the Wooden Aspect Hall.</p><p>During the Formless Immortal Sect's golden age, the Wooden Aspect Hall was renowned for its artifact refinement. These legacies would undoubtedly be of great help to Qin Sang. When he could dedicate himself to studying artifact refinement in the future, his progress would be meteoric. This was an unexpected boon.</p><p>Unexpectedly, both the alchemical and artifact refinement legacies of the Formless Immortal Sect had fallen into his hands.</p><p>Combining the information from the jade slips, Qin Sang found records of the unfamiliar spirit materials. Some could be found in the world with diligent searching, while others relied solely on luck.</p><p>One spirit material in particular, known as Lunar Laurel Immortal Dew, was the rarest, originating from the Celestial Cinnamon Secret Realm of the Heavenly Harmony Hall. Access to this realm was granted only once every few centuries.</p><p>The strange-faced man had not been able to find Lunar Laurel Immortal Dew within the Wooden Aspect Hall.</p><p>Now, with the Immortal Halls ascended, the Celestial Cinnamon Secret Realm inaccessible, where could he find it?</p><p>The Heavenly Exquisite Jade's refining method lacked this information, deliberately erased by the strange-faced man, or else the Weeping Spirit Cave Master wouldn't have been so optimistic.</p><p>There was, of course, one exception. A Nascent Soul cultivator from the Formless Immortal Sect, while exploring the outer reaches of the Storm Belt, stumbled upon an ancient cultivator's legacy and obtained a small vial of it.</p><p>It might still exist in this realm, hidden within some unknown ancient cultivator's legacy.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed Five Element Spiritual Roots, rendering the Heavenly Exquisite Jade useless to him. Yet, seeing this, he couldn't help but feel a tinge of disappointment.  Without the complete set of spirit materials, the value of this secret art was greatly diminished. He needed to carefully consider how to maximize his gains.</p><p>The strange-faced man had withheld more than just this from the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the final streak of light, and he gently beckoned it.</p><p>Landing in his hand was a crystal-clear jade sphere, the size of a baby's fist. It radiated a pure, emerald green light, shimmering like a night pearl.</p><p>This jade sphere was the Heavenly Exquisite Jade!</p><p>However, this Heavenly Exquisite Jade was an unfinished embryonic form.</p><p>Qin Sang focused, his gaze penetrating the emerald light, and he saw flaws within the jade.</p><p>The surface of the sphere wasn't smooth; it was dotted with countless minute cavities, so tiny they were imperceptible without careful sensing.</p><p>Within each cavity were inscribed innumerable restrictions, their intricacy unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen. Perhaps few treasures in this realm could compare.  And this was merely the first layer of the sphere.</p><p>The Heavenly Exquisite Jade could be viewed as five nested jade spheres.</p><p>The five layers possessed comparable levels of complexity.</p><p>When the Heavenly Exquisite Jade took its final form, the five spheres had to be fused into one, their Qi flows balanced without conflict, maintained in a delicate equilibrium.</p><p>Closer inspection revealed that the Heavenly Exquisite Jade wasn't entirely tangible, existing between reality and illusion, capable of merging with any type of natal magic treasure.</p><p>Years ago, the Hall Master of the Wooden Aspect Hall had refined this embryonic form, placing it within the Artifact Chamber to be nurtured by the Hall's unique artifact refinement spirit formation. Later, when the great war erupted, the Hall Master perished, leaving this treasure behind in the Wooden Aspect Hall, gathering dust, unknown to the world.</p><p>The strange-faced man had been overjoyed upon discovering this treasure. Although the embryonic form was far from complete, at least he no longer needed to worry about the Lunar Laurel Immortal Dew.</p><p>Even if he had found several more, he wouldn't have easily given them to the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>The Wooden Aspect Hall's artifact refinement legacy and the embryonic Heavenly Exquisite Jade alone were worth the expenditure of a Boiling Snow Pellet, not to mention that Qin Sang had paid practically no price.</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly praised his luck, carefully storing away the treasures.  He stirred the Mustard Seed Bag again, and three more balls of light flew out.</p><p>A token, a wooden armor, and a broken tree.</p><p>The token was the Wooden Aspect Token.</p><p>From the soul-searching of the Weeping Spirit Cave Master, Qin Sang had learned that the Five Aspect Tokens seemed to play a significant role in Emperor Bestowment Mountain.  He didn't understand the details, so he could only store it away for now and observe its effects later.</p><p>The wooden armor had been frozen by the Ice Soul Divine Light and fallen into Qin Sang's hands after the strange-faced man's death.</p><p>This treasure was undoubtedly a powerful defensive artifact, but it required the removal of the strange-faced man's aura and meticulous refinement before he could use it.  He set it aside along with the broken tree.</p><p>The broken tree was the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree.</p><p>The strange-faced man had self-detonated his Spirit Wood Body, shattering the spirit tree. Its essence remained, a portion surviving, but the tree had been refined by the strange-faced man using secret arts for many years, tainted with his aura. It could only be used for artifact refinement in the future.</p><p>Qin Sang was more interested in the strange-faced man's divine abilities, the Spirit Wood Body and the venomous needles.</p><p>Continuing his search, he finally found a piece of withered wood within the Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>The withered wood was less than a foot long and as thick as a wrist, completely black, clearly a thoroughly rotten piece of deadwood.  His divine sense detected nothing unusual.</p><p>Anywhere else, Qin Sang wouldn't have given it a second glance.</p><p>But upon carefully probing with his divine sense, touching the almost imperceptible point of light at the wood's core, he realized there was more to it than met the eye!</p><p>Recorded within the deadwood were several legacies of the Wooden Aspect Hall, likely left by its descendants.</p><p>These legacies included the strange-faced man's foundational cultivation method, the *Wood Emperor Scripture*, and its corresponding divine abilities, including the *Postnatal Wooden Man Stele*, which Qin Sang had been thinking about!</p><p>Cultivating this divine ability required finding spirit wood and refining it into a Spirit Wood Body, granting immense strength, comparable to a body cultivator, just like the strange-faced man.</p><p>Within a forest rich with wood spirit energy, the cultivator would become like a divine stele, rooted to the earth, their Qi connected to all the trees, drawing in wood spirit energy, gaining all-around enhancements in both strength and recovery ability.</p><p>Qin Sang now understood why the transformed strange-faced man had been so difficult to deal with.</p><p>The strange-faced man had only achieved minor completion of the divine ability.  Greater completion held even more incredible powers, though reaching that level in the Nascent Soul realm was extremely difficult.</p><p>Furthermore, the enhancements from the Postnatal Wooden Man Stele were also related to the quality of the spirit wood.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at his Avatar.</p><p>Back then, the Dao Manifestation Tree had been able to whiten Bai's fur. What spirit tree held a higher rank than the Dao Manifestation Tree?</p><p>However, refining the Dao Manifestation Tree into a Spirit Wood Body and integrating it into himself required restoring the tree to its original form and abandoning his external Avatar. This was a difficult choice to make.</p><p>The *Postnatal Wooden Man Stele* held great potential, enhancing his own body, but the external Avatar possessed the ability to be reborn after death, and he had already invested a tremendous amount of effort and resources into it.</p><p>Refining a Spirit Wood Body was also no simple task.</p><p>His Avatar was about to break through to late Nascent Soul, and its potential might not be inferior to a Spirit Wood Body. The ability to be reborn after death was a powerful divine ability he couldn't give up.</p><p>Even with late Nascent Soul cultivation, Qin Sang didn't dare claim invincibility.</p><p>Sighing inwardly, he put aside these troublesome thoughts for now and stored the withered wood away, retrieving another jade slip.</p><p>This jade slip contained the *Gu Scripture* of the Myriad Venom Mountain, and it was complete.</p><p>The latter half of the *Gu Scripture* didn't record the Gu King cultivation method, but the descriptions indicated that the Gu King was derived from the same lineage.</p><p>The Gu King must have been a core secret of the Myriad Venom Mountain. Qin Sang didn't know how the strange-faced man had obtained it, but he had managed to acquire a portion of the Myriad Venom Mountain's legacy.</p><p>No wonder the Myriad Venom Mountain harbored such deep hatred for him.</p><p>Recorded at the end of the *Gu Scripture* were several venomous divine abilities, the most powerful of which was the *Heaven Severing Soul Shattering Divine Needle*.</p><p>This name was derived from the idea that upon release, the needle would annihilate all living beings and ghosts in heaven and earth, a truly imposing concept, and its power lived up to the name.</p><p>Cultivating this divine ability required using a virulent poison as a catalyst, but refining such poison demanded extreme caution, as haste could lead to the poison invading one's internal organs, resulting in death before mastering the venomous art.</p><p>The strange-faced man had undoubtedly used the Gu King to cultivate this divine ability.</p><p>Qin Sang looked away from the *Gu Scripture* and gazed at the Demonic Fire floating within the cave, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>After devouring its master, the blood-red color on the Gu King was gradually receding, almost returning to its original jade white. However, its ferocious nature hadn't diminished; instead, it seemed to be intensifying.</p><p>He didn't know how to subdue the Gu King and had been using the Demonic Fire as a cage to imprison it.  Even after examining the *Gu Scripture* and the strange-faced man's treasures, he hadn't found a way to subdue it.</p><p>Then, a thought struck him, and Qin Sang understood.</p><p>The Myriad Venom Mountain had dared to reveal this information to him because they were certain that even if he killed the strange-faced man, he wouldn't be able to subdue the Gu King and would have to trade with them.</p><p>The Gu King's venomous light was extraordinary, and its inherent rank was extremely high, making its value immeasurable.</p><p>"What will the Myriad Venom Mountain offer in exchange?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, but he didn't hold high expectations.</p><p>If possible, he preferred to subdue the Gu King himself and control this powerful weapon.  He would at least consult with Ghost Mother before considering a trade.</p><p>But he needed to enter Emperor Bestowment Mountain, so this wasn't a long-term solution.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Gu King for a moment, a thought flickering in his mind.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's Venom Pearl could counteract the Heaven Severing Soul Shattering Divine Needle.  Could he use the Venom Pearl to suppress the Gu King's ferocious nature?  It would be enough to keep it under control during his time within the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>He decided to try.</p><p>Qin Sang sank his mind into his Qi Sea, activating the Venom Pearl.</p><p>Seven-colored light erupted from his dantian, and the Venom Pearl slowly flew out, drifting towards the Gu King.</p><p>Sensing the aura of the Venom Pearl, the Gu King's buzzing wings abruptly stopped.  It turned, its blood-red eyes fixated on the pearl as if facing a formidable foe, then emitted even more rapid and shrill buzzing.</p><p>"A reaction is good…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up.  After a moment of thought, he directly guided the Venom Pearl through the Demonic Fire, placing it before the Gu King.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A beam of venomous light immediately shot out.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare be too careless. He controlled the Venom Pearl to dodge slightly, allowing only the edge of the venomous light to touch it.</p><p>Suddenly, the Venom Pearl transformed into a haze, and the venomous light passed right through it.</p><p>Then, the Venom Pearl re-formed, completely unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it, relieved, and guided the Venom Pearl towards the Gu King.</p><p>The Gu King's wings vibrated frantically, spraying venomous light, but it couldn't hit Qin Sang or destroy the Venom Pearl. Instead, the Demonic Fire gradually restricted its movement, forcing it closer to the Venom Pearl.</p><p>Soon, the Venom Pearl hovered directly above the Gu King's head.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Venom Pearl transformed into a wave of venom-repelling light, as if about to swallow the Gu King whole.</p><p>The next moment, the Gu King was enveloped by the wave of light, the faint outline of the pearl still visible within.</p><p>However, after approaching the Gu King to a certain distance, the light could advance no further.  The Gu King spread its wings, its body emitting a faint blood-red glow, forming a protective venomous light, and flashed out of the light wave.</p><p>The attempt failed, but Qin Sang's face showed no frustration, only surprise, as if he had discovered something unexpected.</p><p>He continued to control the Venom Pearl, repeating the process.</p><p>After dozens of attempts, all ending in failure, the strange look in Qin Sang's eyes intensified. He had made a startling discovery.</p><p>Every time the Venom Pearl enveloped the Gu King, Qin Sang had a feeling that the pearl's power yearned for the Gu King, intending to devour it!</p><p>After so many attempts, Qin Sang was certain this feeling wasn't an illusion.</p><p>He remembered that after its fourth transformation, the Fat Silkworm could directly devour Gu insects. He had even cultivated some for it to feast on, and the Gu King's cultivation method was similar to those Gu insects.</p><p>The Venom Pearl extracted from it had inherited this devouring ability!</p><p>"If the Venom Pearl devours the Gu King, could it continue to improve?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up at this possibility.</p><p>The venom-repelling divine ability was somewhat limited in its application, but when used, its effects were remarkable.</p><p>Qin Sang always believed that external objects were inferior to one's own strength.  The Venom Pearl was closely connected to him, considered a part of himself.  If the Venom Pearl continuously devoured venomous substances, what kind of transformations would it undergo in the future?</p><p>The Gu King's intelligence was low, and in terms of potential, it was clearly inferior to the Venom Pearl.</p><p>The problem was that the Venom Pearl couldn't suppress the Gu King. How could he make the Gu King willingly submit to being devoured?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, recalling various scriptures and studying the *Gu Scripture* again. Even as his True Essence neared full restoration and it was time to leave, he couldn't find a solution.</p><p>Suddenly, inspiration struck, and he clapped his hands.</p><p>Since insect control methods were ineffective, why not approach it from its master's perspective?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure what methods the strange-faced man used to suppress the Gu King. But he knew that the man's foundational cultivation method was the *Wood Emperor Scripture*, attuned to the Wood Dao.</p><p>The Gu King had always been by the strange-faced man's side and might fear this aura.</p><p>However, before having his Avatar attempt this, Qin Sang withdrew his mind from his Qi Sea and returned to his original spirit.</p><p>Since merging with Yun Youzi's Scorched Wood True Spirit, the never-used Yun You Sword was making its debut!</p><p>A flash from his brow.</p><p>Azure sword light instantly illuminated the cave!</p><p>"Old friend, it's up to you…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, filled with a mix of excitement and melancholy, pointing at the Gu King.</p><p>Fused with the Ten Great Divine Woods, the Yun You Sword was a supreme Wood-type treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't using the Yun You Sword to kill the Gu King; he didn't want to risk damaging its true spirit.  Instead, he was catalyzing the sword intent, using the pure and refined Wood-type treasure combined with the strongest sword intent to intimidate the Gu King.</p><p>If successful, he would withdraw the Venom Pearl, the Gu King, and the Yun You Sword into his body, maintaining this state until the Venom Pearl devoured the Gu King!</p>
