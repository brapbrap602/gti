<h1>Chapter 1932: Reason</h1><p>A large boulder slammed into the ground, bounced, and then tumbled down the mountain slope, crossing the mountain path and finally landing in a ravine.</p><p>Grass blades scattered in the air, a rumbling echo reverberating through the mountains.</p><p>The young man, using all his will, scrambled outwards with both hands and feet, narrowly avoiding being crushed by the boulder. He had almost died by his own trap.</p><p>“Huff… huff!”</p><p>The young man gasped for breath, turning his head to look upwards.</p><p>A poisoned spear was embedded in a tree trunk, the body of a white marten impaled upon it. Its head, tail, and limbs hung limply, demonic blood flowing down the spear, crimson mixed with a bluish-black venom.</p><p>The marten remained motionless, seemingly lifeless.</p><p>Yet, the young man dared not lower his guard. Enduring the intense pain, he propped himself up and reloaded his light crossbow.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The crossbow bolt struck the marten squarely.</p><p>The marten made no attempt to retaliate. Struck by the bolt, its body shook violently but remained impaled, blood spraying outwards.</p><p>Confirming the marten's death, the young man seemed to deflate, collapsing onto the ground.</p><p>There was no pride in having hunted a demonic beast with a mortal body.  He simply lay there, his head pillowed on the grass, staring blankly at the blue sky, murmuring, “Master, I have finally avenged you!”</p><p>Tears streamed from the corners of his eyes.</p><p>Scenes from the past surfaced, as heartwarming then as they were heartbreaking now.</p><p>His mother had been frail and sickly since his childhood and passed away not long after. His father, a hunter, also met an untimely end in the mountains when he was eight.</p><p>At eight, he had to begin fending for himself. Relatives and friends were kind-hearted, but they were all poor and could not take him in, only offering what little help they could.</p><p>He knew he was a burden and tried his best not to trouble others, striving to survive on his own.</p><p>Then came his Master, teaching them to read and write, imparting wisdom.</p><p>His Master encouraged him to study, waiving his tuition fees, and his Mistress showed special care for the orphaned boy, giving him a taste of long-lost familial affection.</p><p>But the good times didn't last.</p><p>One day, his Master went to town to buy paper and ink for his students.  He didn't return by nightfall. The entire village searched for him, but they only found a corpse.</p><p>His Master's death was horrific.  His chest had been ripped open, his internal organs missing, his body drained of blood, a desiccated husk.</p><p>The young man clearly remembered the feeling of utter devastation when the body was confirmed to be his Master's.</p><p>His Master was the first victim of the venomous marten.  Afterward, more and more people met tragic ends. The village organized several hunting parties, but to no avail. Instead, the marten took advantage of the chaos to claim several more lives.</p><p>No one dared mention hunting the marten again.  The young man couldn’t find any help, but the flames of revenge in his heart never extinguished.</p><p>He knew that the demonic creature possessed formidable powers. A single mistake could ruin his plan and cost him his life, but he had to do it, to avenge his Master.  Otherwise, he wouldn't be worthy of being called a man!</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>A sharp pain interrupted his thoughts.</p><p>He tried to lift his left arm, but the pain intensified, allowing him to raise it only halfway.  He removed the iron plate from his arm, revealing a gruesome wound.</p><p>His internal organs must have been injured as well.  It felt as if a giant hand had squeezed his insides.</p><p>The young man stuffed a piece of cloth into his mouth, biting down hard as he treated his wound.  Gasping for air, he struggled to his feet and moved to the tree, pulling at the poisoned spear.</p><p>The spear was deeply embedded.  He didn't have much strength left and couldn't pull it free.</p><p>He retrieved the marten from the spear, picked up another poisoned spear to use as a crutch, and stumbled back towards the village.</p><p>The entire village was surrounded by earthen ramparts.  After the marten appeared, guard towers and patrols were also established.</p><p>By the time he reached the village, the young man was nearly exhausted. He raised the marten in his hand and cried out, "I killed the monster!" before collapsing to the ground.</p><p>…</p><p>Xiao Wu and Zhu Que had watched a month-long drama unfold, and even though it had finally concluded, they still felt a sense of unfulfillment.</p><p>Qin Sang, oblivious to the outside world, focused solely on repairing the Thunder Altar, becoming increasingly proficient and restoring it to ninety percent.</p><p>In less than a month, he successfully restored the Thunder Altar completely.</p><p>After a brief meditation, Qin Sang activated the altar.  As expected, he sensed a faint connection with the other two altars.</p><p>He focused his entire mind, grasping this connection tightly, triggering another transformation within the altar.</p><p>Simultaneously, the locations and relationships of the three Thunder Altars were mapped out in his mind.</p><p>‘Crackle!’</p><p>Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled above the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang was bathed in the thunder and lightning, yet it didn't harm him in the slightest. Each lightning fluctuation was different, representing a new transformation.</p><p>Through numerous transformations, and with the aid of the other two altars, Qin Sang's deductions became increasingly clear, eventually pointing towards a specific location.</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed. Although he still couldn't sense the main altar, confirming its location made the search much easier, unless it had been completely destroyed.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The lightning retreated into the altar, and it fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang set up a formation to conceal the altar, preparing to search for the main altar immediately.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang emerge from the crevice, Xiao Wu and Zhu Que both looked over.</p><p>“Finished?” Zhu Que asked.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “I've determined the location of the main altar… Hmm? Tai Yi has brought someone and is waiting in the distance.  They may have discovered something.”</p><p>He sent out a signal, summoning Tai Yi.</p><p>Before long, a white cloud drifted over, carrying Tai Yi and an old Daoist priest.</p><p>“Master, this is Daoist Master Jing Chun, the Abbot of the Xin Huo Temple."</p><p>Tai Yi, imitating Luo Hou, addressed Qin Sang as “Master” in public.  He then introduced the old Daoist, "This is my Master, whose Daoist name is Qing Feng."</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Qing Feng.”</p><p>Over the past few days, Daoist Master Jing Chun had discussed the Dao with Tai Yi, developing immense respect for him.  Faced with Qin Sang, whom even Tai Yi addressed as "Master," he was extremely deferential.</p><p>From Tai Yi's account, Qin Sang learned that the Xin Huo Temple was the largest sect in the vicinity, with a lineage of Thunder Dao inheritance.</p><p>Tai Yi had mostly explored the details of this lineage.  Although the inheritance was related to the Heavenly Court’s Thunder Department, it was unremarkable. Worried he might have misjudged, he brought Jing Chun for Qin Sang to assess.</p><p>Daoist Master Jing Chun, perhaps having received some benefit from Tai Yi, answered Qin Sang's questions without reservation. Unfortunately, the Xin Huo Temple's inheritance indeed held little of value.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to take his leave, but Zhu Que stopped him, acting coquettishly.</p><p>“There's a good show, and it hasn’t finished yet! It won't hurt to wait a few more days!”</p><p>After learning the details of the situation, before Qin Sang could say anything, Daoist Master Jing Chun angrily exclaimed,</p><p>“A demonic beast wreaking havoc, such a thing! Our temple has an agreement with the Divine Path that no local Earth God shrines are established, leaving the area under our protection. Such an incident occurring is a negligence on our part, making us a laughingstock.”</p><p>Daoist Master Jing Chun was indignant, but if he had truly acted according to his words, the monster would have been slain as soon as it harmed someone, long before the young man's desperate act.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal. He glanced at Xiao Wu and said, "Since you are interested, waiting a few more days is fine."</p><p>They sat down on the ground.</p><p>Daoist Master Jing Chun was uneasy, but seeing that Qin Sang didn’t seem to blame the Xin Huo Temple, he relaxed.</p><p>With time to spare, Qin Sang inquired about any ancient legends in the area.</p><p>Daoist Master Jing Chun racked his brains, recounting various legendary tales. Most were absurd, some interesting, but none could be verified.</p><p>On the sixth day, a rainbow light appeared in the distance, heading straight towards them.</p><p>“The main characters have arrived.”</p><p>Zhu Que chuckled, glancing at Daoist Master Jing Chun with an expression of anticipation for another good show.</p><p>Everyone stood up, concealing themselves and vanishing from the mountaintop.</p><p>The rainbow light was a streak of escaping light, enveloping a flying shuttle within which sat a man and a woman.</p><p>Both appeared young, their demeanor and attire as opulent as royal offspring.</p><p>The man was comforting the woman: "Don't worry, Junior Sister. The aura is growing stronger.  The Jade Dragon Marten must be nearby.  That little thing was clever enough to escape from my estate. It wouldn't dare provoke powerful enemies, at most eating a few mortals.  It will be fine."</p><p>“Don’t you mention it!”</p><p>The woman’s face was filled with resentment. “It's all your fault.  You kept saying your people would take good care of it, so I left it at your estate. Now it’s gone! If anything happens to my Jade Dragon Marten, I'll go to Master and make you answer for it!”</p><p>“Alright, alright, I’ll answer for it. If the Jade Dragon Marten is dead, I'll compensate you with a new one and kill those maidservants to vent your anger, alright?”</p><p>The man carefully coaxed her with a smile.</p><p>“I don't want a new one! I want my Jade Dragon Marten!”</p><p>The woman pouted, then her face suddenly lit up with delight.  "I found it!" she exclaimed.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The rainbow light descended, landing upon a village below.</p><p>The two appeared above the village, their gazes fixed on a small Earth God shrine in the north.</p><p>Seeing the scene inside the shrine, the woman's face turned pale, while the man's turned livid.</p><p>Since the young man had brought back the marten's corpse, he had become a hero in the village.  No one dared eat the demonic corpse, so it was offered to the Earth God.</p><p>“Who! Who dared kill my Junior Sister’s Jade Dragon Marten!”</p><p>The man roared in fury.</p><p>Seeing the wounds on the marten's body, the woman wept in heartache, while the man was stunned.</p><p>“These wounds…”</p><p>The man sensed no traces of magical power or artifacts. The Earth God shrine was also empty, devoid of a deity.  He said incredulously, “Could the Jade Dragon Marten have been killed by mortals?”</p><p>No matter how weak, the Jade Dragon Marten was still a demon beast that had attained sentience. How could mortals withstand its demonic arts?</p><p>The man's roar startled the entire village.  Confused, villagers of all ages emerged from their homes, following the sound to the shrine, where they saw the man and woman.</p><p>“They’re Immortals!”</p><p>Someone noticed that the man and woman were floating in the air, not touching the ground, and cried out in astonishment, causing a commotion.</p><p>“They really are Immortals!”</p><p>“The Immortals have manifested! They’ve come to slay the demon!”</p><p>…</p><p>The villagers chattered excitedly, completely unaware that the demon was the Immortals’ pet.  They truly believed the Immortals had come to vanquish evil, their eyes filled with fervor.</p><p>“Who killed my Junior Sister's Jade Dragon Marten? Step forward!”</p><p>The man’s eyes were like blades, radiating killing intent.</p><p>The woman didn't turn her head, sobbing as she held the marten’s corpse.</p><p>The villagers finally realized something was amiss.  They exchanged glances, falling silent, avoiding the man's gaze.</p><p>“I killed it!”</p><p>A strong, resonant voice rose from the crowd as an old man, the village elder, stepped forward.</p><p>“Village Elder…”</p><p>Someone whispered, but the old village elder waved his hand, silencing them.</p><p>He stepped out, his back straight as an arrow, even in the face of the Immortals. “This monster slaughtered over a dozen people in our village alone, ripping open their bellies, draining their blood, leaving their bodies mutilated beyond recognition. I killed it to avenge my fellow villagers!  If you two Immortals want to avenge this beast, kill me.  Don’t take it out on the others.  This old man has lived long enough.”</p><p>These words were not entirely directed at the two Immortals but also at the villagers behind him.</p><p>The villagers understood his meaning.  The village elder was old, but the young man was still young.  He was a hero for slaying the demon for them.  The village elder was willing to die in his place.</p><p>The village elder’s family could only weep softly.</p><p>Several strong men surrounded the young man, holding him back as he struggled.</p><p>“Heh…”</p><p>The man sneered. “You mortals dare deceive me, an Immortal, to my face? Your crime is even greater!  Get out here!”</p><p>With a thunderous shout, he nearly shattered the villagers' souls.</p><p>The young man felt his body tighten as he was seized by an immense force, involuntarily flying forward and crashing heavily to the ground.</p><p>The men who tried to stop him were instantly flung away, spitting blood, unable to move.</p><p>The old village elder’s attempt to take the blame could not fool the Immortal’s discerning eye.  A faint resentment lingered around the young man, confirming him as the culprit.</p><p>But the man didn't believe the young man could have killed the Jade Dragon Marten alone. He grinned cruelly, “Who else? Step forward! Or did the entire village participate?”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>The village elder’s expression changed drastically. Did the man intend to slaughter the entire village?</p><p>“So, the monster is allowed to eat people, but we are not allowed to fight back? What kind of reason is that!” the young man cried out in anguish.</p><p>“Hmph! What are you? A bunch of ignorant fools, daring to discuss reason with me, an Immortal!”</p><p>The man kept an eye on his Junior Sister. His actions were also intended to appease her anger. “No one else will step forward?  Good!”</p><p>Seeing no reaction from his Junior Sister, the man raised his hand, palm facing forward, fingers like swords, shooting five streaks of sword energy directly at the villagers.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A furious shout came from above.</p><p>Seeing that he was truly about to massacre the villagers, Daoist Master Jing Chun couldn’t bear it any longer and revealed himself, dispersing the five streaks of sword energy.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others also landed on the ground.</p><p>“Senior Jing Chun!”</p><p>The man was shocked to see Daoist Master Jing Chun.</p><p>The woman also trembled, the marten’s corpse falling from her grasp as her face paled.</p><p>Their sect had some power, but in the face of the Abbot of the Xin Huo Temple, even their master would have to bow respectfully.</p><p>“Scoundrels! Your spirit beast descends the mountain to harm people, and you indiscriminately slaughter an entire village without distinguishing right from wrong!  Yin Xiao has taught two fine disciples indeed!”</p><p>Daoist Master Jing Chun’s sharp words were like a thunderbolt to the two, who knelt on the ground, trembling in fear.</p><p>“Senior, how should we deal with these two villains?”  Daoist Master Jing Chun’s action further terrified the two.</p><p>“Since your esteemed temple has established laws, handle it impartially,” Qin Sang said, turning to Xiao Wu and Zhu Que. “Have you seen enough?”</p><p>“Boring! Too weak.  It would be more entertaining with a Soul Formation elder,” Zhu Que shook her head and flicked her tail, her arrogant tone surprising even Daoist Master Jing Chun.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  If a Soul Formation elder truly appeared, even his avatar wouldn't be a match.</p><p>“This matter is settled. We shall take our leave.”</p><p>They bowed their farewells to Daoist Master Jing Chun.</p><p>The villagers, having experienced both extremes of emotion in a short span of time, awoke as if from a dream.  They finally understood that these Immortals were good, that they had come to save them. They knelt down to express their gratitude.</p><p>“Ming Yue, the Immortals saved us. Quickly thank them for saving our lives!”</p><p>The village elder saw that the young man was still in a daze and hurriedly pulled him down to kneel.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had already turned to leave, suddenly stopped and looked back at the young man. “Your name is Ming Yue?”</p>
