Chapter 351: The Ten Directions Yama King Banner (Extra chapter for盟主岬角之风!)


Black Dragon Stone, Soul-Binding Rope.
These two magical artifacts were both of excellent quality, each possessing unique and subtle effects, proving quite handy. Qin Sang examined them for a while, refining and incorporating them into his own use.
Aside from these two top-tier artifacts, the other magical artifacts in Liang Yan's pouch were of inferior quality. Qin Sang selected only one, leaving the rest for Shi Hong's self-defense.
After refining the artifacts, a black mist flew out from the pouch. When the mist dispersed, ten black ghost banners hung suspended in Qin Sang's palm.
Liang Yan's Ten Directions Yama King Banner consisted of four banners, three of which were given to him by Yue Wu.
It was likely Yue Wu's diligent service to Elder Yi that earned him these three banners.
The Foundation Establishment cultivator ambushed by Liang Yan was of far lower status than Yue Wu, possessing only one Ten Directions Yama King Banner, a fact that drew Liang Yan's considerable ire.
Over the years, Liang Yan had done everything possible to enhance these four banners to their peak strength.
However, fearing discovery by the Yuanzhao Sect, he dared not contact the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect.  For decades, he lived in hiding, afraid of attracting attention.
Secondly, the Ten Directions Yama King Banner was extremely difficult to refine. Even with the Kuiyin Sect's deceptive methods and control of the Yin煞渊, the success rate remained extremely low. Even their Foundation Establishment disciples couldn't each possess six banners, let alone Liang Yan.
Therefore, he had never been able to acquire a full set of six banners.
Fortunately, Liang Yan only possessed four, not five. Otherwise, he would never have had the patience to tolerate Shi Hong's delay until now.
These four deployed Yama King Banners were Qin Sang's greatest gain. Ten peak-strength ghost banners could form a complete Ten Directions Yama King Formation.
The power of this formation was far inferior to a true treasure.
One must remember that a talisman treasure can at most only seal one-tenth of a treasure's power. The power of the Ten Directions Yama King Formation was at most two to three times that of a talisman treasure.
However, for Foundation Establishment cultivators, it was an absolute treasure.
Qin Sang couldn't help but show a look of delight. With this magical artifact, as long as he had the opportunity to set up the formation in advance, he could fear no late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. Even against a False Core cultivator, he would have a chance of winning!
Unfortunately, there was no opponent here to allow him to test the full power of the Ten Directions Yama King Formation.
Qin Sang shook his head with regret.
The useful information obtained from Liang Yan was limited. Qin Sang's most desired antidote was unknown to Liang Yan, who only knew how to control the Gu insects to threaten others.
In the future, when he encountered other unfortunate souls afflicted with Gu poison, he could play the role of villain, Qin Sang chuckled wryly. Fortunately, he had the Xu Yuan Seal, which could suppress the fluctuations of the Heart-Eating insect to a very low level, so he wasn't too anxious.
However, one piece of information caught Qin Sang's attention and offered a glimmer of hope for finding an antidote.
Liang Yan knew the power of the Ten Directions Yama King Banner and understood that he could never alone gather the complete formation. Therefore, while hiding in the Demon Realm, he had been subtly collecting information on the whereabouts of Kuiyin Sect remnants.
Once he discovered the remnants' location, he would seek them out when his cultivation was sufficient.
He had actually found some ambiguous clues.
This information could be corroborated with what Qin Sang had heard from Old Man Di Que, lending it some credibility.
According to Liang Yan's findings, the last Golden Core demon cultivator of the Kuiyin Sect, relentlessly pursued by the Yuanzhao Sect, was nearly cornered outside Tianyou Pass. Severely injured, he fled into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and vanished, his fate unknown.
To this day, the Yuanzhao Sect has not publicized the death of this demon cultivator, suggesting that he may still be clinging to life.
Several Foundation Establishment cultivators also escaped, all core members of the Kuiyin Sect, some even direct disciples of the three Golden Core elders.  They certainly knew the antidote for the Heart-Eating insect Gu.
These Kuiyin Sect remnants were living in constant fear, with nowhere to turn but to the severely injured Golden Core cultivator.
Based on Liang Yan's knowledge of the Kuiyin Sect and the clues he had discovered, he speculated that these remnants might be hiding under assumed identities in the vicinity of Qingyang City.
But ferreting them out would be difficult.
The Yuanzhao Sect was determined to eradicate evil, backed by the Wuji Sect. Although the pressure had eased, these demons were likely terrified.


Even deep within the heartland of the demonic sects, revealing one's identity was too risky.  Many would be eager to strike a fallen foe, and there was no honor among demonic cultivators.

Qin Sang frowned, lost in thought.

Once her cultivation improved, she could visit Qingyang City.  She could use the Heart-Eating Insect Gu as bait again, luring out any remaining members of the Kuiyin Sect.

Success would not only rid her of the poisonous Gu, but might also yield unexpected rewards.

However, the risk was considerable.

She might attract several demonic masters at once and be overwhelmed.

Worst of all, that surviving Golden Core cultivator might be nearby.  She could fail utterly and lose her own life.

Careful planning was essential.

Lost in thought, Qin Sang unconsciously traversed numerous snowy mountains.  The landscape was bleak and desolate, a wasteland of snow and ice, devoid of life, with even birds and animals exceedingly rare.

Suddenly, Qin Sang descended from the air, landing on a mountain peak.  After using her spiritual sense to confirm she was alone, she chose a spot with abundant spiritual energy, carved a cave with her sword, and set up several layers of restrictions.

She sat down, released Liang Yan from the Corpse Puppet Bag.  She hadn't yet refined him into a corpse puppet, intending to do so here before continuing her journey.

Back at the Kuiyin Sect, Liang Yan had attempted to persuade Yue Wu to hand Qin Sang over as a sacrifice for the Yama Banner.

Qin Sang felt no pity for Liang Yan.

She had already used the first two Heavenly Corpse Talismans. However, while surveilling Liang Yan in Feng Cang Market, she had found time to refine two more using a Soul-Guiding Herb.  These were now to be used on Liang Yan.

Although she had failed once again, Qin Sang was becoming increasingly proficient at refining the talismans; she could now refine one in less than two days.

Qin Sang considered her pressing tasks.

She put Liang Yan aside for the moment, took out a piece of spirit wood for her Wumu Sword to absorb, and then used her last Soul-Guiding Herb to refine another Heavenly Corpse Talisman.

To her delight, this attempt was entirely successful. By the seventh day, she had completed all three!

She now had five Heavenly Corpse Talismans!

Qin Sang turned her gaze to Liang Yan. After preparing the five Yin materials and the talismans, she methodically proceeded, erasing Liang Yan's consciousness.

Everything went smoothly. Only the final step, the refinement with earth-slaying energy, remained.  Whether these two corpse puppets would truly be successfully refined, however, was still uncertain.
