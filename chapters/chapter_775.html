<h1>Chapter 767: Purple Crystal</h1><p>Ahead lay a deep pit, resembling a small lake.</p><p>However, it wasn't filled with water, but with a dense purple mist that had accumulated to form a purple 'lake,' even overflowing onto the ground.</p><p>Even more peculiar was a massive vortex at the lake's center. The purple mist continuously converged into it, and the object that had attracted the Fat Silkworm lay at the lake's bottom.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the edge of the lake, his brow furrowed as he stared at the center.</p><p>The poisonous mist within the small lake was incredibly dense, flowing like real water. The Fat Silkworm had already exhausted its strength bringing him here and dared not take half a step into the lake.</p><p>Even if there were treasures inside, they couldn't enter.</p><p>A single wave, and both he and the Fat Silkworm would likely perish within.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm hung its head dejectedly, clearly aware of this. The enticing treasure was so close, yet unattainable.</p><p>"Something's not right!"</p><p>As if sensing something, Qin Sang abruptly looked up, his gaze fixed on the sky above the opposite shore of the lake. He then slowly retreated, circling around the lake, and silently approached.</p><p>Upon arriving, he discovered the opposite shore lay at the foot of a sheer cliff.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed himself in the shadows, not daring to make a sound. Clinging to the cliff face were agile figures, and he could even see their cold, eerie gazes through the purple mist.</p><p>These were all ferocious beasts!</p><p>Each one was the size of a mastiff and similar in build. The difference was the pair of wings growing from their ribs.</p><p>They clung upside down to the cliff, their limbs gripping tightly, shoulders hunched, tails tucked in. Their wings, spread like fans, were thin as cicada wings, mere membranes of flesh, clinging tightly to the cliff face. Their eyes were fixed on the lake, seemingly awaiting something.</p><p>Even these creatures, which lived in this perilous environment of purple mist, dared not enter the lake, indicating the extent of the danger within.</p><p>Such a large pack of ferocious beasts here!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. Hiding in a crevice, he suppressed his aura and observed the beasts, lost in thought.</p><p>Judging by their posture, it seemed something of interest to them would emerge from the lake's center. It was highly likely to be the same thing attracting the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>This meant he could obtain the treasure without entering the lake.</p><p>However, the nature of the treasure, the scale of the disturbance upon its emergence, and the method of obtaining it remained unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang's greatest concern was the strength of these beasts.</p><p>A pack of ferocious beasts guarding this place, making no sound, clearly indicated the treasure's importance to them. They wouldn't relinquish it easily.</p><p>The number of beasts was substantial, covering the entire visible cliff face.</p><p>If these were all of them, the chances of snatching the treasure were high.</p><p>He vaguely sensed these beasts were stronger than the Purple Star Eagles. With his superior speed, escaping after seizing the treasure seemed very possible.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't dare get too close. He hadn't seen their leader and wasn't sure how many more were above.</p><p>"Wait and see for now."</p><p>Qin Sang decided to wait and observe any changes in the lake.</p><p>Of course, his time was limited. If the lake remained unchanged for too long, he'd have to leave to attend to his primary objective and return later for the treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang released the Two-Headed Vulture. Both man and beast hid in the shadows, waiting for the right moment.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally calculated, needing to leave ample time for his search for the spiritual fire and his journey to the Celestial Tower.</p><p>Suddenly, the Fat Silkworm perked up, its eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He shifted his gaze, focusing intently on the lake.</p><p>Within moments, the vortex at the lake's center began to fluctuate strangely. A purple light seemed to be spiraling upwards from the depths, emerging from within.</p><p>Simultaneously, the beasts on the cliff stirred, lifting their heads in unison, staring excitedly at the purple light, just like the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The purple light's true form finally became clear â€“ a crystalline object. This crystal was arm-length, a columnar shape, with one end perfectly formed and the other clearly broken.</p><p>Pure and flawless, it emitted a dazzling purple light.</p><p>It was this purple crystal that attracted the Fat Silkworm!</p><p>The beasts shared the same target.</p><p>"Could this purple crystal be the purest essence, condensed from the accumulated poisonous mist?"</p><p>Qin Sang speculated, somewhat surprised. He had expected a poisonous fruit growing at the bottom, not this unfamiliar purple crystal.</p><p>The center of the vortex was the calmest point. Qin Sang and the pack of beasts watched as the purple crystal, caught in the vortex, rose rapidly.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that although the beasts were restless, none dared to jump down.</p><p>As the purple crystal rose higher, nearing the surface...</p><p>Suddenly, a 'crack' echoed. The crystal, struck by a surge of purple mist, developed a fissure. Fragments broke off from the broken end, floating and sinking within the purple mist before vanishing with a swirl.</p><p>The purple crystal was unexpectedly fragile!</p><p>At that moment, the beasts on the cliff sprang into action.</p><p>'Swish, swish, swish...'</p><p>They pushed off the cliff face, spreading their fleshy wings and gliding downwards. The most conspicuous beast, significantly larger than the others with more robust wings, was clearly their leader.</p><p>It took the lead, diving straight towards the lake's center.</p><p>The other beasts followed, but upon reaching the lake's edge, they abruptly flapped their wings and sharply ascended, seemingly afraid to approach the vortex.</p><p>Only the leader continued towards the heart of the lake.</p><p>At this point, the crystal suffered another impact, the fissure splitting completely, detaching a small piece. This lighter fragment rose quickly, developing numerous cracks, as if on the verge of disintegration.</p><p>The leader let out a low growl and, from a distance, spewed a stream of purple fire.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The flames struck the purple crystal.</p><p>The impact shattered the crystal, exploding into smaller crystalline shards.</p><p>Some fragments dissipated into the purple mist, but the larger shards successfully emerged. The beasts, gliding into position, began scrambling for the crystal shards.</p><p>There was a certain order to this scramble.</p><p>The stronger beasts snatched the larger shards, while the weaker ones dared not compete, even actively avoiding them, contenting themselves with the smaller pieces. The leader swallowed the largest shard.</p><p>Qin Sang now understood.</p><p>The purple crystal undoubtedly contained a potent poison, both alluring and fearsome to the beasts.</p><p>He had now assessed the beasts' strength and believed his chances of seizing the treasure were high.</p><p>While powerful, the leader wasn't at the level of a shape-shifting demon, and its speed wasn't exceptional. Its advantage lay in the agility granted by its wings.</p><p>Some beasts, having obtained purple crystals, flew away to their lairs to refine them.</p><p>The leader remained, intending to secure more crystals for its pack. Otherwise, the crystals would dissipate into the mist before reaching the surface, leaving them with nothing.</p><p>The next emergence of the crystal was uncertain. Qin Sang couldn't wait indefinitely. He decided to act, seizing the remaining crystals.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm used all its strength to communicate with the Two-Headed Vulture. The Two-Headed Vulture understood and, emerging from the crevice, split into several illusory copies, lunging towards the beasts. This instantly diverted the attention of all the beasts.</p>
