<h1>Chapter 2061: The Fog Year</h1><p>“Old Wu, your words are a bit too arbitrary,” someone interjected from the side. “Do you think we’re the only ones who know there are good things in the Grand Ascension Dao Field? Don't you think those powerhouses would be tempted? Perhaps countless experts have already gone in and turned the Source Sea upside down, only we're unaware of it.”</p><p>The ship captain wasn't annoyed, chuckling instead. “Those great figures come and go as they please, and it has nothing to do with us. I just wanted to let Fellow Daoist Qin know how dangerous it is inside, lest he underestimate it and throw his life away.”</p><p>“That makes sense!” The man nodded in agreement. “Logically speaking, the Source Sea should be a sacred ground for cultivating the Poison Dao, but even those Poison Dao cultivators only dare to linger around the periphery.  I hear that even then, many people vanish without a trace after entering. Now there are all sorts of rumors, each more outlandish than the last.”</p><p>“Thank you both, Fellow Daoists, for the warning. I’ll keep it in mind.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands in thanks, then asked curiously, “Since the Source Sea is so powerful, how did such a force decline, even to the point where its inheritance was severed?  Did they offend some formidable enemy?”</p><p>“Who knows?” The ship captain shrugged, squeezing the remaining venom from the pouch in his hand, ending the strange fish’s life. He then lifted the fish's head, broke off all its sharp teeth, and with a swift kick, sent the carcass back into the sea.  The scent of blood attracted a swarm of fish, their white bellies momentarily flashing on the surface.</p><p>This sight made the ship captain laugh heartily. He tossed the fish teeth in his hand to the crowd. “Finders keepers!”</p><p>Then, turning to Qin Sang, he said, “Whether the legends are true or false, only Heaven knows. Perhaps they’re all fabricated. Even if such a force existed, Fellow Daoist, look at the Source Sea's location. Is there anything to be surprised about?”</p><p>This place was situated between the territories of three races, a land of constant strife. Even now, it couldn't be called harmonious, let alone in ancient times.  With the Source Sea in such a place, once it showed any sign of weakness, its destruction would be imminent.</p><p>“Not necessarily,” the previous man began to contradict the ship captain again. “Someone saw mysterious human cultivators even further out than the Source Sea.  It’s said that some reclusive sects, unwilling to be ruled by the Great Zhou Dynasty, escaped into the outer sea, their lineages stretching back for ages. They’re even closer to the other races, yet they remain safe and sound. It's hard to say what exactly happened in ancient times…”</p><p>Qin Sang listened to their conversation with great interest. Though these were just rumors and legends, they offered a glimpse into the complex situation of the East Sea, far more intricate than he’d imagined.</p><p>What surprised him most was the Poison God.</p><p>After ascending to the Great Thousand World, Qin Sang had heard very few rumors about Grand Ascension cultivators. Most were fragmented, mixed with a great deal of myth. This was the clearest he'd heard, even including a title.</p><p>Could this Poison God be related to the *Poison God Canon*?</p><p>Qin Sang thought about the wonders of the *Poison God Canon*. Upon obtaining it, he knew it was a superior cultivation method.  It was this method that allowed his cultivation to advance by leaps and bounds during the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang transmitted his voice to Jian Nu, “Fellow Daoist, have you ever heard Senior Tian Yue mention the *Poison God Canon*?”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t asked Senior Tian Yue directly, but he was eighty percent sure that after Tian Yue learned of his poison control abilities, he deliberately left the *Poison God Canon* as a guide for him to retrieve.</p><p>Otherwise, how could it be such a coincidence that the first time he entered the Ju Mountain Healing Altar, he obtained a cultivation method perfectly suited to him, along with a sacred ground for cultivation?</p><p>He wondered where Senior Tian Yue got it.  Could he have been to the Source Sea? Or had the Poison God also perished in the Violet Firmament Palace?</p><p>“I have not heard Master mention it,” Jian Nu's reply came quickly.</p><p>At this time, the treasure ship veered further south. Qin Sang stood by the railing, gazing towards the Source Sea.</p><p>Because he only had a fragmented copy of the *Poison God Canon*, lacking the parts beyond the Void Refinement stage, he had abandoned the cultivation method after reaching Void Refinement. Unexpectedly, he now had another clue.</p><p>“Countless Fellow Daoists have ventured into the outer sea. Surely some have found treasures and remnants of techniques related to the Source Sea. Has anyone collected these things?”</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang’s question, the ship captain scrutinized him. “Could it be that Fellow Daoist is heading to the Source Sea?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. “A Grand Ascension inheritance, who in the world wouldn’t be tempted?”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist is quite frank.”</p><p>The ship captain nodded. “The outer sea has countless treasures, and countless items of unknown origin. Every sect has some old relics gathering dust. Fellow Daoist, go and inquire. Perhaps you might find something.”</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him and, readily accepting the suggestion, went to inquire among the merchants on the ship.</p><p>The treasure ship sailed through the air, making a wide detour and smoothly arriving at the south side of the Source Sea.</p><p>One day, the ship captain steered the treasure ship above a rocky island.  Seeing the disarray below, he frowned slightly and muttered, “They've changed locations again!”</p><p>He took out a compass, activating it with spiritual energy. After a moment, he received a response, steered the treasure ship, and soon a sea of fog appeared ahead.  After sailing through the fog for a short while, an island came into view.</p><p>Houses stood neatly on the island, inhabited almost entirely by human cultivators. It was a market town.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the bow of the ship. When the treasure ship docked at the shore, he informed the captain and floated down.</p><p>Because the market town needed to relocate frequently, the merchants here didn't bother with elaborate decorations, and the shops were quite straightforward and simple.</p><p>Qin Sang casually chose one and entered.</p><p>The shop was deserted. There were no other customers. A young attendant in a blue robe was engrossed in a book.  He only noticed Qin Sang when he approached and quickly got up, apologizing with a smile. “This humble one was engrossed in reading and neglected the Immortal Lord. Please forgive me! Immortal Lord, please see if there is anything that catches your eye.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, noticing that the shop mostly contained various medicinal pills. He tapped his fingers lightly on the counter. “Do you have any treasures or fragments of techniques of unknown origin? Bring them all out.”</p><p>The attendant was momentarily stunned, then his face broke into a wide smile. “Please wait a moment, Immortal Lord. This humble one will fetch them right away.”</p><p>He hurried to the back room and quickly returned with several mustard seed pouches. “Immortal Lord, please have a look.”</p><p>Qin Sang opened a mustard seed pouch to examine its contents. The attendant stood by silently, his face full of anticipation.  These were all items that no one in the shop had shown interest in.  He had acquired them only to have them sit unsold.  Selling even one item would be a gain.</p><p>His divine sense swept through the first pouch, which contained fragments of various magical treasures. Some seemed extraordinary but had lost their power, rendering them worthless.</p><p>He opened the second mustard seed pouch and examined each one in turn, spending a little more time on a pouch filled with various jade slips and ancient books.</p><p>If this Poison God was the same Poison God, then the Source Sea must contain cultivation techniques and secret arts based on the *Poison God Canon*. Even if only fragments remained, as long as there was any connection to the *Poison God Canon*, he would be able to recognize it.</p><p>Unfortunately, after looking through everything, he didn’t find any such cultivation techniques or secret arts.</p><p>He then went to the next shop, searching one by one. In the end, he bought a few interesting trinkets, but his true purpose remained unfulfilled.</p><p>The treasure ship stayed on the island for several days before setting sail again, stopping at a market town every so often along the way. During these stops, some people boarded the ship, while others disembarked.</p><p>Each time this happened, Qin Sang would go ashore to inquire.</p><p>Even Su Nu noticed something was amiss. “Brother Qin, do you believe the legends about the Source Sea are true?”</p><p>She had initially scoffed at such legends, but Qin Sang’s attitude made her waver.</p><p>Qin Sang repeated the same explanation he'd given to Captain Wu.</p><p>Su Nu said, “Since Brother Qin is interested, why don’t I accompany you to the Source Sea?”</p><p>Qin Sang closed the bamboo scroll in his hand, gazing towards the Source Sea with a contemplative expression. Finally, he shook his head gently. “Forget it.”</p><p>He had been busy for so long without finding any trace of connection to the *Poison God Canon*, not even a decent poison cultivation technique.  Could such a powerful force truly vanish completely without a trace?</p><p>Of course, it was also possible that he was too late, and someone had already ‘cleaned up’.</p><p>Regardless of whether the Source Sea was as dangerous as the legends claimed, he hadn’t found any clues. Entering the Source Sea would be like wandering around blindly.  Exploring the entire Source Sea would take far more than a year or two, which was clearly impractical.</p><p>Qin Sang’s interest had been piqued mainly by the name ‘Poison God,’ which might be a wild goose chase.  Taking such a risk for it was not worth it.</p><p>He had another, even more important reason for abandoning poison cultivation: his Poison Pearl was shattered!</p><p>If the Poison Pearl were still intact, he might have truly ventured deeper into the Source Sea to investigate.</p><p>Without the Poison Pearl to suppress the toxins within his body, the *Poison God Canon* was just a superior cultivation method, and it wouldn’t have the same miraculous effects as before.</p><p>Because he had cultivated poison techniques, Qin Sang knew more ways to deal with external poisons than his peers.  However, if the Source Sea was truly as dangerous as the legends said, he might not be able to escape unscathed.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang abandoned the idea of entering the Source Sea. Even if he were to explore it, he would do so after finding the Storm Realm and improving his own cultivation.</p><p>However, during the rest of the journey, Qin Sang continued to inquire about information until it was time to disembark.</p><p>The treasure ship had traveled around most of the Source Sea and would continue eastward, while Qin Sang and his companions were heading north to search for the teleportation formation.</p><p>After disembarking, Qin Sang summoned a flying boat. He and Su Nu took turns piloting it, concealing their auras as much as possible.  Their journey was uneventful.</p><p>Inside the flying boat, Su Nu held a sea chart. Si Lu drew a circle on it. They were not far from this location now.</p><p>“Brother Qin,” Su Nu called out.  “Ahead is the sea route used by the Foreign Tribes. This is where Fellow Daoist Si Lu encountered them. It might be best to leave Gu Ya and the others behind.  The three of us can scout ahead. If we encounter any trouble, it will be easier to escape. We can come back for them after finding the teleportation formation.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Qin Sang found a deserted island and left Gu Ya and the others there.  Then, the three of them concealed their figures and quietly entered the sea region.</p><p>They were initially very cautious. After a while, they didn’t detect any danger. It seemed that the Foreign Tribes hadn’t realized that Si Lu had arrived through a teleportation formation.</p><p>However, according to Si Lu, even if the other side had noticed, there was no need to worry. The place where they encountered them was not near the teleportation formation.</p><p>After searching for a while, Si Lu finally determined the direction, leading Qin Sang and Su Nu further on.  Ahead, a vast expanse of reefs appeared.</p><p>There were tens of thousands of reefs, scattered like stars, but each one was small. The largest was less than ten miles in circumference, while the smallest could barely support a person.</p><p>The tides surged here, occasionally washing over the reefs.  Vegetation was sparse, and spiritual energy was thin. It was a barren land.</p><p>“Is this it?”</p><p>Qin Sang swept his divine sense around, but didn't perceive any unusual fluctuations.</p><p>“These reefs are part of the teleportation formation. Please wait a moment,” Si Lu nodded, his figure flashing as he landed on a reef.</p><p>Next, his figure flickered continuously, appearing on one reef after another, casting some kind of hand seals. Qin Sang and Su Nu watched his actions carefully. After a period of time, without any noticeable fluctuations, the scenery before them changed slightly.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang and Su Nu confirm that there was indeed a spirit formation here.</p><p>“What exquisite craftsmanship!”</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>All the reefs were ordinary, even the spiritual energy was extremely thin, yet they formed a grand formation. He wondered whether it was a naturally occurring wonder or the work of a cultivator of incredibly high realm.</p><p>Finally, Si Lu landed on a single rock.</p><p>This rock had previously appeared bare, covered in moss. Now, with the formation activated, its true appearance was finally revealed!</p><p>“To prevent accidents, we made some alterations, but this formation is too complex.  Chamberlain Xia deliberated repeatedly before daring to damage this corner,” Si Lu pointed to a corner of the spirit formation.</p><p>Qin Sang flew forward and silently deduced. “Chamberlain Xia exercised great restraint. This section isn’t difficult to repair.”</p><p>Su Nu said, “Brother Qin, give me the flying boat. You two repair the formation, and I'll bring them here.”</p><p>After Su Nu left, Qin Sang and Si Lu got to work. By the time she returned with the others, the formation had been fully repaired.</p><p>Gazing at the teleportation formation, Gu Ya was filled with excitement.  The Storm Realm was getting closer. After wandering abroad for hundreds of years, she could finally return to her sect!</p><p>“Activate the formation!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded firmly.</p><p>Si Lu stepped forward and inserted spirit stones.  With a humming sound, the runes within the formation lit up one by one, emitting a brilliant light.</p><p>The light grew increasingly brighter.</p><p>“It’s open!”</p><p>Si Lu focused his senses, his face lighting up as he shouted.  In the next moment, the formation beneath them trembled violently, and they felt a wave of dizziness as they were engulfed by the spiritual light.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on the sensation brought about by the spatial translocation. Apart from the great teleportation formations between the Eight Great Celestial Continents, this should be the longest distance he had ever traveled in this way.</p><p>This time, the feeling was similar to the teleportation formations between the various immortal cities, just more intense, but completely different from the great teleportation formations between the Eight Great Celestial Continents.</p><p>That was a sensation akin to traversing time and space, showing how special those great teleportation formations were.</p><p>No wonder there were still only those few.</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Qin Sang suddenly felt the pressure on his body disappear. He opened his eyes and found himself in a dark cave.</p><p>Everyone gradually regained consciousness. Although the brothers Qing Jia and Qing Yi had broken through to the fourth level of the Origin Realm, they still felt some discomfort, but they quickly adjusted.</p><p>Out of caution, Qin Sang had tampered with the teleportation formation. Everyone then walked towards the cave entrance.</p><p>The stone door was tightly shut. Si Lu stepped forward, tapped his fingers on the stone door several times, and gently pushed it open.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A cold wind carrying a white mist surged into the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang saw the scene outside the cave. Between heaven and earth, all was a vast expanse of white, with dense, swirling mist obscuring everything.</p><p>Without using spiritual power, relying only on eyesight, it was impossible to see anything more than a zhang away.  Living beings without cultivation would have no way to survive here.</p><p>Si Lu frowned slightly, carefully sensing for a moment.  "I actually forgot. It's the Fog Year now."</p><p>39314321.</p><p>...</p>
