<h1>Chapter 757: The Earthsplitting Sect</h1><p>“Still trying to make excuses!”</p><p>Xiang Yi roared, his eyes icy. “Cui Ji, do you think my blade isn't sharp enough, that I dare not kill? If you jeopardize the Merchant Alliance's affairs, I'll take your dog life first!”</p><p>The richly dressed, stout man, seeing the tense atmosphere, quickly stepped between the two, mediating, “Fellow Daoist Xiang, calm down. Fellow Daoist Cui must have been certain that his actions wouldn't affect the greater plan before making his move.  The beast appeared suddenly, the situation was urgent, and you were inside the stone hall. There was no time to consult with you…”</p><p>As he spoke, the stout man winked at Cui Ji.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Cui, why were you so eager to kill Daoist Qing Feng? I hear you've been stuck at a bottleneck for over a decade, with no clue how to break through. Could this man be your inner demon, the reason you're stuck and unable to advance?”</p><p>Cui Ji bowed his head to Xiang Yi, admitting his fault, and shook his head. “This bottleneck has been exceptionally stubborn. I've toiled for years, nearly giving up hope. Later, I received news that the Seven Kills Hall possesses a certain spirit herb that might help me break through. I'm not sure if that Daoist is my inner demon.  It wasn't originally necessary to kill him. A minor grudge from over twenty years ago isn't something I can't let go of. However, the moment I saw him on Desolate Island, a wicked fire surged within me, difficult to suppress. It must have some influence. To be safe, it was naturally better to kill him, lest this inner demon waste the spirit herb…”</p><p>The stout man nodded. “Fellow Daoist Xiang, we two have been following your orders, constantly observing the others. I also secretly approached and investigated.  Aside from this fellow surnamed Pan, the others seem to be alright. Didn't you say six people would be enough to break the formation? Though Fellow Daoist Cui acted somewhat impulsively, fortunately, he hasn't jeopardized the main objective.”</p><p>Seeing Xiang Yi's expression soften, the stout man and Cui Ji both secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The stout man pointed at the mangled corpse on the ground and asked, “Fellow Daoist Xiang, have you confirmed his identity?”</p><p>“Earthsplitting Sect!”</p><p>Xiang Yi kicked the giant beast's carcass. “See this Earthsplitting Lizard?  These creatures are ferocious, and only the Earthsplitting Sect possesses the secret art to tame them.  This lizard possesses the astonishing strength of the late Core Formation stage, a rarity even within the Earthsplitting Sect, indicating this man's status was definitely not ordinary. He was also concealing his cultivation. His strength was only slightly inferior to mine. If the Alliance Leader hadn't bestowed upon me a Water罡 Divine Thunder, he might have actually succeeded.”</p><p>“Water罡 Divine Thunder? No wonder there was such a commotion! I hear it's a Water-type secret treasure that only Nascent Soul Grandmasters cultivating techniques like the Water罡 Divine Scripture are qualified to condense, and it requires considerable time, possessing astonishing power.”</p><p>The stout man looked down at the cultivator surnamed Pan, clicking his tongue twice. “Earthsplitting Sect?  Could he be from the Demonic Path? Unbelievable! It seems our Merchant Alliance has been targeted by the Demonic Path.”</p><p>Xiang Yi nodded.</p><p>“What's so strange about that?  Our three great Merchant Alliances have always been thorns in the sides of both the Righteous and Demonic Paths. If it weren't for our unity and adherence to our own affairs, never displaying ambition, we would have been annihilated by a joint Righteous-Demonic force long ago.</p><p>“Within the Demon Sea, there are numerous cultivators from both the Righteous and Demonic Paths recruited by the various merchant guilds, but they all serve as guest elders. For someone like him to infiltrate the core of the Merchant Alliance, he must have ulterior motives.</p><p>“Only with the Alliance Leader's assigned mission at hand would he risk exposure and attempt to seize the prize.</p><p>“As for whether he acted on orders from the Demonic Path or of his own volition, that remains unknown.</p><p>“Earthsplitting Lizards excel at earth遁 techniques.  He likely released the lizard from within the canyon. With his strength, it wouldn't be difficult to evade our detection. Then he commanded the lizard to lure the Purple Star Condor during the chaos, allowing him to fish in troubled waters.”</p><p>The stout man chuckled.  “This fellow was quite cunning, but still a step behind Fellow Daoist Xiang. He never imagined we were already prepared for this, that the true mission lies ahead.  This stone hall is merely the first stage of the mission. Fellow Daoist Xiang, with a small trick, forced him out. However…”</p><p>The stout man's tone shifted, a puzzled expression appearing on his face. “From what Fellow Daoist Xiang has said, this mission isn't particularly difficult. A Nascent Soul Grandmaster dispatched by the Merchant Alliance could complete it effortlessly. Why go to such lengths, even allowing a Demonic Path spy to infiltrate our ranks?”</p><p>Xiang Yi glanced at him.  “How do you know a Nascent Soul Grandmaster hasn't already arrived?”</p><p>Cui Ji and the stout man exchanged bewildered glances.</p><p>“Our three Merchant Alliances are under the scrutiny of the Righteous and Demonic Paths. We wouldn't easily deploy Nascent Soul Grandmasters. Those seniors certainly have their own missions. Moreover, infiltration by spies is inevitable.  The Merchant Alliance isn't like a sect. The various guilds operate independently, and it's impossible to enforce absolute obedience. To appease all parties, the Alliance Leader can't monopolize the slots, so we must be vigilant ourselves and root out the spies.”</p><p>Xiang Yi turned toward the battlefield. “Alright, we've wasted enough time.  Let's go rescue Fellow Daoist Liu and the others, lest they perish at the hands of the beasts.  I can overlook the previous incident, but if anyone dares to abandon their post again, don't blame me for being ruthless!”</p><p>The stout man smiled. “Thanks to Fellow Daoist Xiang's trust, we will diligently complete the mission. Besides, An still relies on Fellow Daoist Xiang's assistance in acquiring the treasure. How would I dare be negligent?”</p><p>Cui Ji also nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Xiang Yi led the charge toward the battlefield, then suddenly remembered something, turning to ask Cui Ji, “Are you certain Daoist Qing Feng is dead?”</p><p>Cui Ji patted his chest.  “Rest assured, Fellow Daoist. I was well prepared. I gravely injured him and personally witnessed him being engulfed by the poisonous mist and the beast horde. He's definitely dead. Absolutely no trouble for Fellow Daoist Xiang.”</p><p>…</p><p>As they entered the battlefield to rescue the others, Qin Sang's figure silently appeared at the edge of the large pit.</p><p>The situation was very different from what he had anticipated.</p><p>It turned out Xiang Yi was fishing, and the stout man and Cui Ji had already been recruited by him.</p><p>In that case, Cui Ji's unauthorized attack on him wasn't a bad thing. Otherwise, he might have faced the combined assault of all three, which would definitely be more dangerous than the current situation.</p><p>If Cui Ji was a venomous snake, the stout man was a smiling tiger, and Xiang Yi was even worse.  He had no prior grievances with the two, had even exchanged pleasantries with them moments before, yet they could readily agree to help Cui Ji kill him without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the cultivator surnamed Pan and the Earthsplitting Lizard.</p><p>At the instant of the upheaval, they had been knocked away by the lizard, so he hadn't gotten a clear look. It wasn't a beast from the forbidden zone but the cultivator's spirit beast.</p><p>“Earthsplitting Sect… Demonic Path…”</p><p>Qin Sang overheard their conversation.</p><p>The name Earthsplitting Sect was somewhat familiar to Qin Sang.  It seemed to be one of the major Demonic Path sects.</p><p>Qin Sang had always been active in the Demon Sea and only had a rudimentary understanding of the Inner Sea.</p><p>According to his knowledge, the Inner Sea, with its flourishing human population, saw a sharp divide between the Righteous and Demonic Paths. The three great Merchant Alliances rose to prominence amidst this conflict, while numerous other sects and rogue cultivators either secluded themselves or chose neutrality.</p><p>Coupled with the ever-watchful Witch Tribe, the situation was incredibly complex.</p><p>Opening up the Demon Sea had apparently eased tensions within the Inner Sea; otherwise, a full-blown war would have already erupted.</p>
