<h1>Chapter 148: Valley of Shadows</h1><p>A moment later, the High Priest suddenly activated the divine runes, reaching out to the stone pillar. The pillar shimmered, runes danced, and a wondrous sight appeared, but then vanished just as quickly.</p><p>Undeterred, the High Priest tried again and again, each time the pillar's glow lasting a little longer.</p><p>Hope bloomed on the faces of the onlookers.</p><p>Venerable Fang remained silent, careful not to disturb the High Priest.</p><p>The High Priest alternated between attempting to activate the pillar and quietly meditating.</p><p>After a long while, a look of understanding dawned on the High Priest's face.  With newfound clarity, they rapidly formed hand seals, sending streams of energy into the eight stone pillars.</p><p>Suddenly, the pillars erupted in a blinding light.</p><p>The entire hall was illuminated, bright as day.</p><p>Strange waves emanated from the eight pillars, converging towards the center of the formation. However, the light soon dimmed, the energy threatening to dissipate once more.</p><p>The High Priest paused, then let out a soft sound of surprise.  Quickly changing the hand seals and activating more divine runes, they poured all their power into the formation.</p><p>Finally, the formation stabilized, and the energy fluctuations in the center intensified.</p><p>The others seemed to sense something, expressions of bewilderment appearing on their faces.</p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p>Before anyone could finish their sentence, the formation fully activated. A gentle, moonlit array appeared on the stone platform, glowing softly.</p><p>Seeing the completed array, even the High Priest was stunned.</p><p>The group exchanged puzzled glances.</p><p>An elder couldn't help but exclaim, "A Teleportation Array! There's no mistaking it! How could there be a Teleportation Array here? And where does it lead?"</p><p>The High Priest had activated a Teleportation Array!</p><p>There was a similar array on Mount Wushen that led to the Demon Sea. Although the two arrays looked quite different, they shared the unique energy signature of a Teleportation Array.</p><p>No one had expected to find an ancient Witch Tribe Teleportation Array here.</p><p>Was the external barrier and the two layers of sealing formations all designed to conceal this Teleportation Array?</p><p>Everyone found it incredibly strange and couldn't understand the reason.</p><p>"Those seals might have been meant to hide the array's existence," the High Priest mused. "It's impossible to know now, but in ancient times, the relationship between the Witch Tribe and the Human race was unclear.  This place is deep within human territory. Our ancestors might have taken these precautions to prevent its discovery..."</p><p>The others nodded silently, finding the High Priest's theory plausible.</p><p>Countless years had passed, making the truth impossible to uncover.</p><p>Where did this Teleportation Array lead?</p><p>Could it connect to another cultivation world, similar to the Demon Sea?</p><p>At this thought, several elders grew excited. A new cultivation world represented new hope. Perhaps it held the secrets to reaching the Deity Transformation stage, maybe they would find other descendants of the Witch Tribe, or at the very least, more resources.</p><p>Venerable Fang saw through their hopeful fantasies and scoffed, "Don't get your hopes up. This Teleportation Array is within the Seven Kills Sectâ€™s territory. With our current strength, we can't possibly wrest it from the humans. Even if we found a new cultivation world, it would take decades to make a single discreet round trip. Besides, I doubt this array can transport us very far..."</p><p>The immediate question was what lay on the other side, and whether it held danger.</p><p>Venerable Fang hovered in place, a knowing look on his face.</p><p>If he teleported and encountered a great peril, he might not have a chance to return.</p><p>He would absolutely not take such a risk, blindly paving the way for others.</p><p>Just then, an elder stepped forward, patted their spirit beast pouch, and summoned a Core Formation stage spirit beast.</p><p>"We can easily find out if there's danger on the other side."</p><p>With that, the elder commanded the spirit beast to step onto the platform.</p><p>The High Priest took out several mid-grade spirit stones and activated the Teleportation Array.</p><p>With a flash of light, the spirit beast vanished.</p><p>Everyone's eyes fell on the spirit stones, noticing that they hadn't depleted much energy.</p><p>"The transmission distance is very short, likely within the Seven Kills Sect's territory. It probably leads to some sort of secret realm," the High Priest analyzed.</p><p>Before they could finish speaking, the elder suddenly paled and groaned.</p><p>Then, to everyone's astonishment, the elder swallowed a medicinal pill. Their color slowly returned, and with a sigh of relief, they lamented, "My spirit beast is dead!"</p><p>Everyone was shocked. "It died the moment it arrived on the other side?"</p><p>The elder nodded gravely.</p><p>This revelation startled the others.</p><p>This elder was skilled in beast taming, and their spirit beasts were known for their prowess. The Core Formation spirit beast, particularly adept at escape techniques, hadn't even lasted a moment.</p><p>They looked at each other in silence.</p><p>Having finally found a trace of their ancestors, they had to investigate, no matter the cost.</p><p>But who would be the next to scout the unknown?</p><p>"High Priest, I am facing my tribulation in a few years. I don't believe I have much hope of surviving it.  Dying here wouldn't be a great loss. To do something for the tribe before I die would be a worthy end. I have no sect or disciples. If I don't return, I have a few descendants. I hope the High Priest will look after them."</p><p>An old man stepped forward and spoke solemnly.</p><p>The High Priest replied respectfully, "Don't worry, Elder Wan. I will bring them to Mount Wushen to cultivate in peace."</p><p>Elder Wan nodded and stepped onto the platform, activating the Teleportation Array.</p><p>Everyone waited anxiously.</p><p>Before long, the array lit up again.  A surge of hope filled the group, but seeing Elder Wan's condition, they were shocked.</p><p>The skin on Elder Wan's face had turned black for some unknown reason, emitting faint black fumes. His aura was weak.</p><p>A grey-robed cultivator noticed something amiss and immediately rushed over.  After a brief examination, they took out a bottle of medicinal pills and gave one to Elder Wan.</p><p>"Elder Wan has been poisoned!" the grey-robed cultivator whispered.</p><p>Elder Wan nodded in thanks to the grey-robed cultivator, sat down cross-legged, and refined the medicinal power, slowly purging the poison from their body.  Their complexion gradually improved.</p><p>"No wonder my spirit beast died instantly," Elder Wan said with a wry smile.  "The other side is a deadly poisonous wasteland, filled with a colorless, odorless toxin. Even I was caught off guard.  I sensed something was wrong and took the antidote I carried, but it had little effect against this potent poison.  I had to return for help and didn't have time to observe closely. From what I could tell, aside from the poison, there doesn't seem to be any other danger. However, please be extremely careful.  If you're exposed to too much of the toxin, even a Nascent Soul cultivator might perish!"</p><p>After hearing this, the High Priest and Venerable Fang exchanged glances.</p><p>Venerable Fang chuckled darkly, "If I'm not mistaken, the other side must be the Valley of Shadows.  Unexpectedly, this Teleportation Array connects to the inner sanctum. The inner sanctum has always been occupied by the humans, but now we can get a share of the spoils."</p><p>The High Priest hummed in agreement. "Within the Seven Kills Sect, the three deadliest locations are the Violet Mist Wasteland, shrouded in violet mist, and the Fairy Flower Lake, covered in poisonous algae, both located in the outer sanctum.  And unless you're at their very core, those two locations couldn't possibly possess such a potent toxin capable of instantly affecting a Nascent Soul cultivator. Only the Valley of Shadows in the inner sanctum is rumored to be filled with such a colorless, odorless, and insidious poison."</p>
