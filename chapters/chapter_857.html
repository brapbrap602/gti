<h1>Chapter 849: The Nine Transformations of the Wu Yin Body</h1><p>“While the Five Yin Mystic Body is inferior to the Nine Transformations of the Wu Yin Body the Master is seeking, it can still withstand the erosion of True Devil Qi.  Unfortunately, this secret method of forcibly infusing True Devil Qi to cultivate the Five Yin Mystic Body has a pitifully low success rate and extremely demanding requirements. If it weren’t for the unexpected discovery of a Yin-Extinguishing Stone in the Seven Kills Hall, I couldn't even set up the spirit array. Thankfully, it succeeded. I only hope this young woman won't disappoint me…”</p><p>Yue Xiangu muttered to herself, her gaze softening as she looked at the young woman, Su Nu.</p><p>She took a brocade robe from her pouch and draped it over Su Nu, her voice gentle. “Su Nu, you possess the Five Yin Mystic Body; your cultivation will be exceptionally efficient, and your future is limitless.  Master has spent a fortune and travelled for a hundred years to complete this ritual for you.  Don’t forget your Master.”</p><p>Su Nu tightened the robe around herself and nodded slightly.</p><p>She had lost many memories, but the fragments she retained all indicated that the woman before her was her closest relative, her most loving master.</p><p>Her initial fear vanished, replaced by filial affection in her gaze towards Yue Xiangu.</p><p>Yue Xiangu smiled with satisfaction. “Alright, the spirit array is about to be destroyed by the backlash of the True Devil Qi; we must leave immediately. The journey home is fraught with danger, and I cannot protect you indefinitely. The True Devil Qi within the array is already linked to your Qi; quickly absorb it to restore your original strength. Perhaps you can even break through to a higher level, giving you some ability to protect yourself in case of an emergency.”</p><p>At this time, Su Nu was not only physically weak but also had a feeble aura, barely stronger than an ordinary person.</p><p>Su Nu obediently followed Yue Xiangu’s instructions and lay back in the jade coffin.</p><p>Yue Xiangu closed the coffin lid and gently pushed it towards the center of the spirit array.</p><p>This spirit array was quite strange. In its center was a palm-sized stone, square and without any holes, yet it constantly emitted a low, humming sound.</p><p>Once the coffin rested on the stone, Yue Xiangu carved blood talismans onto the coffin, but unlike before, these talismans were far more intricate.</p><p>After completing the talismans, Yue Xiangu rapidly changed her hand seals.</p><p>Under Yue Xiangu’s guidance, a stream of True Devil Qi emerged and flowed into the coffin.</p><p>In an instant, Su Nu was submerged in the True Devil Qi.</p><p>This True Devil Qi was not as violent and unruly as the Qi outside; it was calm and flowed quietly within the coffin. A slow-moving vortex formed in the center, pointing towards Su Nu’s dantian.</p><p>Su Nu lay motionless, while Yue Xiangu outside seemed even more exhausted.</p><p>As Su Nu absorbed the True Devil Qi, her aura steadily rose, breaking through to the thirteenth level of Qi Refinement in one go, before suddenly stopping.</p><p>At this moment, a sharp cracking sound echoed from the edge of the spirit array, as cracks appeared, signaling its imminent destruction. Yue Xiangu’s expression turned tense as she watched Su Nu.</p><p>The stagnation in Su Nu's cultivation was brief. She successfully established her Foundation, and her aura continued to soar.</p><p>Yue Xiangu’s face lit up, but then she saw cracks appearing on the central stone, her eyes widening in alarm.  She didn’t dare delay, quickly swiping her sleeve to shatter the jade coffin, gathering Su Nu within, and then swiftly retreating.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Before they even escaped the cave, the spirit array was completely destroyed by the True Devil Qi.</p><p>A tremendous roar echoed as the released True Devil Qi, like a ferocious black dragon, surged from the depths of the cave, its terrifying power causing even Yue Xiangu to change color.</p><p>They fled the cave in a desperate rush, and even after escaping, they didn’t dare to pause.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and the other two on guard at the peak sensed the anomaly, their gazes fixed on the misty valley below.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Yue Xiangu burst out of the mist with Su Nu, pursued by a terrifying dark shadow, like a monstrous beast emerging from the abyss.</p><p>Upon witnessing this, the three exchanged glances, their expressions grave.</p><p>Clearly, the dark beast was composed of True Devil Qi. It was unclear what Yue Xiangu had done to trigger its eruption, but they were powerless to suppress it, only able to watch as it soared into the sky, creating a phenomenon visible for hundreds of miles.</p><p>This island was a haven for countless beasts.</p><p>Entering was easy, but leaving safely would be far more challenging.</p><p>“Daoist Qingfeng, catch Su Nu!”</p><p>With the True Devil Qi rapidly approaching, Yue Xiangu shouted urgently, forcefully throwing Su Nu towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly channeled his True Essence, creating a gentle force to catch Su Nu.  He noticed her weightlessness and couldn't help but glance at her.</p><p>Nearly consumed by the demonic energy, Su Nu's eyes showed a flicker of panic, but her expression remained calm.  She softly said, "Thank you, Daoist Master."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed something strange about Su Nu's aura; it faintly resembled the demonic energy.  This woman was apparently cultivating using demonic energy, a rare practice in the mortal realm.</p><p>She seemed to be using some unique secret technique, her body light as a feather.</p><p>With a cultivator of her low level using escape techniques, speed and energy consumption would inevitably be affected.  Su Nu's secret technique should prevent her from being a burden.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, grasped Su Nu's wrist, and their figures flashed as they retreated from the valley entrance.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yue Xiangu was overtaken by the demonic energy. Her silken threads, woven into a large net, took the brunt of the impact.  After being engulfed, the spiritual light on the net dimmed at an alarming rate, before being completely shattered.</p><p>A cry of pain echoed as the demonic energy slammed into Yue Xiangu's protective aura.</p><p>Fortunately, Zhu Shanweng and Kong Yun acted swiftly. Sensing danger, they immediately retreated back into the valley, summoning their respective treasures to shield Yue Xiangu from the demonic energy's onslaught at the critical moment, rescuing her.</p><p>'Whoosh... whoosh...'</p><p>Zhu Shanweng and Kong Yun supported Yue Xiangu on either side, hurrying to Qin Sang's side.</p><p>By now, the demonic energy had dispersed the mist and soared into the heavens.</p><p>In the pre-dawn sky, a black pillar of energy was clearly visible, forming a huge black cloud high above.  A terrifying aura spread far and wide, awakening the sleeping beasts in the mountains.</p><p>Ignoring the loss of her treasure, Yue Xiangu shouted, "Go!"</p><p>Knowing the danger, the group wasted no time, protecting Su Nu at the center as they fled at full speed along their original path.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others wisely refrained from questioning Su Nu's identity.</p><p>...</p><p>The demonic energy caused a celestial phenomenon, throwing the Demon Island into chaos. Weaker beasts were terrified, while the powerful demons surged towards the source of the black cloud.</p><p>Not far from the valley...</p><p>A magnificent golden eagle, leading several hawks and eagles, flew towards them. Upon seeing the towering black pillar, the eagle let out a long cry, abandoning its companions and transforming into a golden streak of lightning with a beat of its wings.</p><p>In a mountain cave, a giant bear was slumbering, awakened by the demonic energy's aura.  Its bear eyes opened, wide as copper bells, radiating a fierce light.  Sensing the approaching eagle, daring to trespass on its territory, it erupted into furious rage.</p>
