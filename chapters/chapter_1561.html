<h1>Chapter 1552: Encountering the Strange</h1><p>Chapter 1552: Encountering the Strange</p><p>Silence filled the journey.</p><p>Approaching the Southern Red Archipelago.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed her cultivation to the Golden Core stage, following Zhou Ruan and the other.</p><p>The Southern Red Archipelago was originally obscure, a rather remote area in the East Sea.  The islands only housed some low-level cultivators, and only recently had it become bustling.</p><p>The frequent appearances of Golden Core cultivators, a rare sight before, made the local cultivators apprehensive.</p><p>Rumors were still spreading.</p><p>When Qin Sang and the others arrived, the number of cultivators drawn to the archipelago was still relatively small, with most still on their way.</p><p>After landing, Zhou Ruan and the other were familiar with the area. They found one of the archipelago's market towns, contacted local forces, and gathered information.</p><p>Qin Sang initially followed them, but later wandered the market alone, observing the cultivators coming and going.</p><p>Many were clearly outsiders, and their cultivation bases were not weak.</p><p>Zhou Jin's cultivation was only middling among them.</p><p>Some were surely trying their luck.</p><p>But Qin Sang believed a large portion were scouts sent by various factions.  The whereabouts of Hui Guang Saint and Dan Yu True Monarch remained a mystery, and various factions were eager to confirm or deny the news.</p><p>The market town was a mixed bag, but no trouble had broken out yet.  Everyone knew they were there to gather information and wouldn't act recklessly, lest they offend a powerful faction; their sects might not be able to protect them.</p><p>After walking for a while, Qin Sang didn't sense any Nascent Soul cultivators; few worked so hands-on.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, wait."</p><p>Zhou Jin's call came from behind.</p><p>Qin Sang pretended not to have noticed, turning around at the sound.  She saw Zhou Ruan and the other quickly approaching, followed by three strangely dressed cultivators.</p><p>"Why did you wander so far?  We couldn't even use our divine sense freely within the town, making it difficult to find you!"</p><p>Zhou Jin complained.</p><p>"Didn't we agree to meet at the inn tonight?"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned confusion, her gaze falling on the three behind them.  "Who are these three?"</p><p>There were two men and a woman.</p><p>The elder man and woman were both at the Golden Core stage, while the younger man was around Ruan Yu's age.</p><p>Their clothing and appearance were unlike those of ordinary people, quite unique even in the East Sea.</p><p>Each had ten or eight colorful pouches around their waists; the pouches bore intricate patterns and fluctuating restrictions, but they didn't seem to be magical artifacts or dimensional pouches.</p><p>Furthermore, their pockets were all bulging, it was unknown what they contained.</p><p>Even Foundation Establishment cultivators rarely carried so much on their person; they likely possessed special abilities.</p><p>Zhou Jin gestured, smiling.  "Let me introduce you! Daoist Qin, these three are the Leng Clan Trio, incredibly capable and righteous. We met them three years ago in the North; unexpectedly, we've encountered them here.  Trio, this is Daoist Qin, whom I mentioned earlier. We traveled together from Bieli Island and are close friends."</p><p>"Long admired! Long admired!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>The Leng Clan Trio responded with a strange gesture.</p><p>"How dare we call ourselves the 'Trio'? It's just a title others bestowed upon us. Daoist Qinâ€™s aura is profound and unfathomable, like Daoist Zhou and Ruan, you must be from a reputable Daoist sect, enviable indeed," the elder man, Leng Qi, chuckled, his voice raspy and grating.</p><p>Like a viper's hiss, it was extremely unpleasant.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across his throat, pondering.</p><p>These three were unlikely to be real siblings. Their auras were unique, neither Buddhist nor Daoist, but without any chaotic elements. They likely had a lineage; it was unknown which sect they belonged to.</p><p>After listening to Zhou Jin's further explanation, Qin Sang learned that the Leng Clan Trio had also been drawn by the legends of the ancient immortal sect, arriving several days earlier. They had already gathered some information.</p><p>Seeing that more and more experts were arriving in the Southern Red Archipelago, the trio decided to quickly search the sea for a head start. They were recruiting companions and happened to encounter Zhou Ruan and the other.</p><p>"I trust Daoist Zhou's character. With the three of you assisting, it should be foolproof. Daoist Qin, what do you think? No one has found the ancient immortal sect yet. If we are lucky enough, we'll each rely on our own abilities later."</p><p>Leng Qi was quite confident and directly extended the invitation.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Leng Qi produced a jade slip and handed it to Qin Sang.  "Daoist, please take a look. This is the information we've gathered. We haven't found any relics of the ancient immortal sect, but it wasn't entirely fruitless. The legends of gods and immortals in the Southern Red Archipelago are significantly more prevalent and unique than elsewhere, which suggests there's a reason behind it..."</p><p>The jade slip contained various legends and a nautical chart of the area around the Southern Red Archipelago, marking several islands for investigation.</p><p>Leng Qi was very generous.</p><p>Before Qin Sang agreed to join them, he presented the information they had painstakingly collected.</p><p>After examining the jade slip, Qin Sang considered and agreed.</p><p>Leng Qi was delighted and became significantly more enthusiastic.</p><p>That night, Leng Qi settled them in an inn.</p><p>On the third day, at noon, Qin Sang and the other two went to the docks as planned and easily found a treasure ship.</p><p>Sensing the auras on board, Qin Sang scoffed inwardly.  A small ship, yet it held at least twenty Golden Core cultivators.  Even in the Central Plains, where cultivation was flourishing, such a sight was rare, let alone in the East Sea.</p><p>Leng Qi led the three onto the ship, immediately drawing scrutinizing glances that quickly faded.</p><p>Qin Sang, seemingly unfazed, sat down with Zhou Ruan at a round table.  Zhou Jin handled any attempts at conversation.</p><p>Leaning back in her chair, Qin Sang closed her eyes to rest, her spiritual senses alert.  She detected no Nascent Soul cultivators and felt no prying gazes.</p><p>More people boarded the ship over time.  </p><p>Finally, when the sun was high, Leng Qi entered the cabin and announced their departure. The treasure ship shuddered slightly and left the dock.</p><p>After the initial awkwardness, the cultivators on board quickly became friendly.  However, they tacitly avoided inquiring about each other's backgrounds.  With so many Golden Core cultivators together, few posed a threat, so the atmosphere was relaxed. They chatted and exchanged stories, especially about the legendary ancient sect ruins, their excitement palpable, as if they were truly heading there.</p><p>Leaving the southern archipelago, the islands thinned out.</p><p>Leng Qi steered the ship personally, following the planned route, searching island after island.  Qin Sang personally inspected each one.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the various rumors proved almost entirely false. There were only deserted islands; no trace of any ancient sect.</p><p>Repeated disappointments gradually dampened everyone's spirits.</p><p>...</p><p>One day, halfway through the journey, the treasure ship sped across the sea, leaving a white wake.</p><p>Leng Qi noticed Qin Sang and Zhou Ruan standing at the ship's rail. Curious, he approached them, intending to ask what they were doing.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang hissed, "Below!"</p><p>With a swoosh, Zhou Jin made a swift hand gesture, releasing a stream of light that shot into the sea.  </p><p>Then, with a splash, the light returned, revealing a jade ring-shaped artifact containing a strange, monstrous fish!</p>
