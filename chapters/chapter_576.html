<h1>Chapter 569: Retrieving His Remains</h1><p>“You don’t need to go.”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and quickly searched the area.</p><p>The Xia Bei Chen Star Array was severely damaged, nearing its limit. Several cracks split the star chart, and the stars dimmed.</p><p>Those cultivators wielding the Zi Wei Secret Technique were the most numerous to have entered the Zi Wei Palace this time.  They had hidden within the Xia Bei Chen Star Array, and under the protection of the spirit array, luckily escaped the Abyssal Calamity. But with the array collapsing, some unfortunately suffered misfortune.</p><p>Fortunately, the array didn’t disintegrate instantly.  Except for the initial collapse in one corner, others were prepared and escaped in time.</p><p>Qin Sang caught sight of Yun Youzi successfully avoiding a crack, and felt relieved. The cultivators present were scattered by the array cracks.</p><p>After searching, Qin Sang finally found Granny Jing in a corner of the Xia Bei Chen Star Array.</p><p>Granny Jing was hunched over, leaning on her cane, appearing very inconspicuous.  Unless someone was actively looking, they wouldn't notice her.</p><p>Leng Yuntian was not far from Granny Jing, busily gathering his disciples. He was completely unaware that the Granny behind him, like a venomous snake, had her eyes on him.</p><p>Granny Jing glanced at Qin Sang and directly told him the location of an ancient hall.</p><p>“If you truly manage to enter and see his remains…”</p><p>Granny Jing hesitated, letting out a barely perceptible sigh, and softly said, “Then bring his remains out, and let him rest in peace.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood.</p><p>The Five-sided Pagoda, stained with the blood-polluted divine light, should be the Yuan Shen Sect's heirloom treasure. The Abyss’s meticulously crafted Blood Mulberry Spirit Array’s power far exceeded Qin Sang’s Ebony Sword. The Five-sided Pagoda was clearly unusable, and Leng Yuntian couldn't restore it so quickly.</p><p>During his time in the Zi Wei Palace, Leng Yuntian lacked the protection of the Five-sided Pagoda, greatly diminishing his strength. No wonder Granny Jing didn’t need him anymore.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure about Granny Jing’s true cultivation level.</p><p>Years ago, when Granny Jing took him to infiltrate the Dong Yang Bo Manor, Qin Sang thought she was a Yuan Ying cultivator, possibly even stronger than Dong Yang Bo.</p><p>But in the battle at Zhi Tian Peak, despite various limitations, Granny Jing didn't seem as effortless against the Palm Star Elder as he had imagined.</p><p>These two conflicting displays left Qin Sang baffled and unable to fathom her true strength.</p><p>He guessed Granny Jing was definitely stronger than Leng Yuntian, otherwise, she wouldn't be so confident.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Chen Yan, wondering if she had sensed Granny Jing’s voice transmission. However, Granny Jing didn’t reveal anything crucial in her words, so even if it was detected, there was nothing to worry about.</p><p>Thankfully, Granny Jing kept her word. Even though she didn't need him, she still paid him.</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted. Saving the blood-polluted divine light was a good thing. This ability needed time to recover after each use, meaning he only had one chance in the Zi Wei Palace.</p><p>If he encountered danger later, he would have one more trump card.</p><p>Hearing Granny Jing's last words, Qin Sang thought, Granny Jing and Elder Qingzhu must have a deep connection, but he didn't know the exact nature of their love-hate relationship.</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind that if he found Elder Qingzhu’s remains, he would definitely bring them out, hoping to build goodwill with Granny Jing.</p><p>The Abyss's surprise attack was extremely vicious, causing heavy losses to both realms, especially the Tian Xing Alliance, and they certainly wouldn't let it go.</p><p>After leaving the Zi Wei Palace, the cultivation world would likely descend into chaos.</p><p>What slightly reassured Qin Sang was that his sect had two Yuan Ying cultivators. Being under a strong protective umbrella was far more fortunate than the scattered cultivators and disciples of smaller sects.</p><p>However, nobody would ever refuse more backing.</p><p>While thinking about this, Qin Sang and Qiu Mu Bai, along with others, were flying with Chen Yan when suddenly, he felt a tightening sensation, followed by a blinding white expanse.</p><p>A boundless sea of clouds filled their vision.</p><p>They had finally broken through the Immortal Array and entered the Zi Wei Palace!</p><p>Before they could express their joy, Chen Yan didn't fly towards the Heavenly Gate, but instead led them straight into the sea of clouds, causing a dizzying spin.</p><p>“The Zi Wei Palace isn't behind the Heavenly Gate, but within the sea of clouds?”</p><p>Even in his dizziness, Qin Sang still found the mental space to wonder about these things.  A subtle force constantly guided them, preventing them from scattering. With Chen Yan protecting them, there was nothing to worry about.</p><p>“The Heavenly Gate is above, but the Zi Wei Palace is below. Entering the Zi Wei Palace isn't through the Heavenly Gate.  Is this below the real Zi Wei Palace? Or did the Zi Wei Palace fall from the sky in ancient times and land in the sea of clouds?”</p><p>Qin Sang felt that the logic was off.</p><p>He clearly saw that beyond the Heavenly Gate was nothingness, only the gate itself standing lonely on a cloud-topped peak. The view inside and outside the barrier was exactly the same.</p><p>Qin Sang's suspicions were correct.  Even when the senior cultivators first discovered the Purple Micro Palace, they had similar doubts.</p><p>But no one could ever unravel the mystery. No one knew if the Cloud Sea Palace was the fallen Purple Micro Palace or another structure. Because the Heavenly Gate bore the inscription "Purple Micro Palace," that name was adopted.</p><p>However, regardless of the Cloud Sea Palace's true nature, it didn't matter to them, as no one had ever fully explored it.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Several figures fell from the sky in the desolate ancient courtyard, landing hard, crushing the withered grass, and kicking up dust.</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed a branch of an ancient tree in the courtyard to break her fall, landing with the broken branch, managing to stay on her feet.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai fared similarly, but the other three weren't so lucky, tumbling like bowling pins, their hair and clothes covered in dry grass and leaves.</p><p>After they scrambled to their feet, looking disheveled, Chen Yan gracefully descended.</p><p>She seemed completely unaffected, not a single fold of her clothing disturbed.</p><p>After Qin Sang and the others tidied themselves, they bowed to Chen Yan.  "Thank you, Great-Aunt Master, for your protection."</p><p>Chen Yan revealed her Yuan Ying cultivation. Their attitude toward her now mirrored the respect they showed Dong Yang Bo – a deep, formal bow.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai and the others, while shocked, couldn't hide their joy. They clearly understood the significance of another Yuan Ying expert in their sect.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Chen Yan refused their obeisance.  She said calmly, "I am not your Great-Aunt Master.  Continue to address me as Senior."</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai and the others exchanged glances, confused, but obeyed. "Disciples obey!"</p><p>Chen Yan stood silently in the courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang and the four others waited, observing their surroundings.</p><p>The courtyard was immense, overgrown with weeds.  At the edge stood enormous ancient trees, each thick enough for more than a dozen people to embrace, their age unknown.</p><p>At the other end were the ruins of a palace, completely collapsed, leaving only broken sections of walls, their original purpose indecipherable.</p><p>The entire courtyard was a scene of desolate stillness.</p>
