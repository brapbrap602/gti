<h1>Chapter 1289: Shifting Circumstances</h1><p>The city of Wangdong was a fortress, easy to defend but difficult to attack.  </p><p>True Lord Canghong spared no expense, committing nearly all his forces to the assault. However, the Nether Demon Lord had long prepared for a brutal battle, steadfastly holding the city without venturing out.  </p><p>The battle raged for an entire day and night, exceptionally fierce and bloody.  </p><p>Wangdong City remained unconquered.  </p><p>True Lord Canghong let out a long sigh, realizing that the tide had turned against him. He knew he had no choice but to abandon the siege.  </p><p>...  </p><p>At Twin Mirror Mountain,  </p><p>Qing Jun received urgent news and immediately launched a full-scale attack.  </p><p>This time, he aimed to capitalize on the enemy's fear and low morale. He vowed not to rest until Twin Mirror Mountain was taken!  </p><p>The offensive was repeatedly thwarted, but after brief respites, the attacks resumed. As the battle raged, Qing Jun ordered the spread of rumors about the Old Demon Ye's retreat, sowing chaos among the Sin Abyss forces.  </p><p>Qin Sang bore a heavy responsibility.  </p><p>Qing Jun presided over the Gale Formation, deciphering the patterns of Twin Mirror Mountain's spirit array. The top experts of the Sin Abyss had to be intercepted by Qin Sang himself.  </p><p>Immortal Qiu Zhi, confident in her abilities to counter Qin Sang, handed over control of the formation to a single-named cultivator and personally took to the battlefield, seeking an opportunity to slay Qin Sang.  </p><p>While entangled with Immortal Qiu Zhi, Qin Sang remained vigilant, employing nearly all his techniques. Though he managed to hold his ground, the strain was immense, and he struggled to endure.  </p><p>Fortunately, as night fell, Jingyu, who had received the message, finally arrived and joined the battle, allowing Qin Sang to breathe a sigh of relief.  </p><p>The tide of the battle gradually shifted in favor of the Two Realms Alliance.  </p><p>After a night of relentless fighting, the arrival of reinforcements sent by True Lord Yi became the final straw that broke the camel's back.  </p><p>"We can only take this much," said a cultivator surnamed Song, handing over a jade slip. When the battle erupted, he had been arranging an escape route.  </p><p>The jade slip listed the items they could salvage. Compared to the resources in Twin Mirror Mountain's treasury, it was but a drop in the ocean. However, given the sudden turn of events, this was the best they could do.  </p><p>Seeing the list on the jade slip, the Sin Abyss Nascent Soul cultivators winced in pain, but there was no better alternative.  </p><p>The defeat of the Old Demon Ye was unexpected for both sides. Originally, the Sin Abyss could have retreated at their leisure, but now all their plans were thrown into disarray.  </p><p>The battlefield's situation took an unforeseen turn due to this unexpected development.  </p><p>"Retreat!" Immortal Qiu Zhi declared decisively, though the slight furrow of her brow betrayed her lingering resentment.  </p><p>'Boom! Boom!'  </p><p>One after another, dark crystal towers rose from the ground.  </p><p>Within the Gale Formation, Qing Jun noticed the Sin Abyss's movements. Her gaze sharpened, and with a flick of her jade fingers, several streaks of light shot into the battlefield. Simultaneously, she chanted an incantation, and nine massive pillars of wind erupted from the ground, crashing into the Sky Lake above.  </p><p>'Rumble!'  </p><p>The mountains trembled.  </p><p>The Gale Formation tore through the Sky Lake. Qing Jun, having deciphered the patterns of the mountain-protecting array, launched a full-scale assault. Immortal Qiu Zhi and the single-named cultivator jointly controlled the formation, while others activated the dark crystal towers to cover the retreat of their forces.  </p><p>'Kill!'  </p><p>Unlike the demoralized Sin Abyss, the Two Realms Alliance cultivators were invigorated, charging forward with fierce determination.  </p><p>Qin Sang was about to seize the opportunity to destroy a few dark crystal towers when he caught the incoming streaks of light. It turned out to be an order from his senior sister.  </p><p>The Sin Abyss still had dark crystal towers, making it unrealistic to annihilate them entirely. The most pressing matter now was the treasury on Twin Mirror Mountain. They had to locate it quickly and prevent its destruction.  </p><p>Jingyu had been following Qin Sang, and the others soon regrouped with them.  </p><p>With Qing Jun's support, the group stormed Twin Mirror Mountain together.  </p><p>Upon seeing the mountain's current state, Jing Lin's eyes reflected a mix of emotions.  </p><p>Twin Mirror Mountain had been transformed into a fortress by the Sin Abyss. Encampments stretched across the entire mountain range, leaving no trace of its former appearance.  </p><p>"Over there!" Jingyu's gaze swept across the scene, locking onto a cluster of palaces.  </p><p>Dust filled the air as palace after palace collapsed, some blown apart, others engulfed in flames. It was clear that someone was deliberately destroying them.  </p><p>According to their informant, that was the location of the treasury!  </p><p>"Hurry!"  </p><p>The group immediately flew toward the treasury.  </p><p>The Sin Abyss cultivators, spotting Qin Sang and the others, panicked. They hastily activated protective barriers to buy time while frantically destroying the treasury.  </p><p>At that moment, the treasury's barriers suddenly dimmed, and a cultivator rushed out, shouting, "I am Fang Qi, a junior disciple! Seniors, please come in quickly!"  </p><p>It turned out that this person was an informant from the Two Realms Alliance. He had infiltrated during the chaos and seized the opportunity to deactivate the barriers.  </p><p>"Traitor!"  </p><p>"So it was you!"  </p><p>...  </p><p>The Sin Abyss cultivators cursed Fang Qi, but it was too late to rectify the situation. They scattered and fled. Qin Sang and the others rushed in, relieved to find that only a small portion of the treasury had been reduced to ruins.  </p><p>In the end, the Sin Abyss was powerless to turn the tide and abandoned Twin Mirror Mountain.  </p><p>However, under the protection of the dark crystal towers, the Sin Abyss's battle formations remained intact. The Two Realms Alliance pursued them for a distance but, finding it difficult to achieve further gains beyond the Gale Formation's range, sounded the retreat and returned to the mountain to regroup.  </p><p>Twin Mirror Mountain had changed hands.  </p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators gathered in the grand hall atop the mountain, all visibly pleased.  </p><p>"We must hurry to Wangdong City. The rest is in your hands," said the reinforcements as they bid farewell.  </p><p>With Wangdong City now vulnerable and the Nether Demon Lord and his forces struggling to hold it, they had to return swiftly to provide support. Losing Wangdong City was unthinkable.  </p><p>"Thank you for your efforts, fellow Daoists," Qing Jun said with a bow, requesting that the City Lord of Yinshan Pass and others accompany them to Wangdong City. Originally, sending Qin Sang and Jingyu would have ensured success, but considering the enmity between Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo, they had to choose others instead.  </p><p>After the battle,  </p><p>Twin Mirror Mountain lay in ruins.  </p><p>After inventorying the treasury's resources and taking a brief respite, Qing Jun ordered the army to march!  </p><p>Speed was of the essence, and opportunities were fleeting.  </p><p>The Old Demon Ye was severely injured, and the Sin Abyss had fled a thousand miles, their morale in tatters. They had to seize this moment of chaos, relentlessly pursuing their enemies to deny the Sin Abyss any chance to regroup.  </p><p>From then on, the advance was unstoppable. Three armies marched forward, singing triumphant songs.  </p><p>The Sin Abyss's defeat was like a collapsing mountain.  </p><p>The Old Demon Ye and True Lord Canghong attempted several times to rally their scattered forces and regroup at strategic passes. But before they could stabilize their positions, the Two Realms Alliance's armies were upon them, launching relentless assaults without pause.  </p><p>The Sin Abyss suffered defeat after defeat.  </p><p>The Old Demon Ye's words proved prophetic—they might indeed have to flee all the way back to Yu City.  </p><p>...  </p><p>After months of bitter warfare,  </p><p>The Heavenly March Plateau was finally fully reclaimed, forcing the Sin Abyss into the plains.  </p><p>Between the Heavenly March Plateau and the Sin Abyss lay a narrow stretch of plains, serving as a buffer zone between the two regions. The plains were sparsely populated but rich in spiritual mineral resources.  </p><p>The Heavenly March Alliance and the Sin Abyss had long clashed over these resources, their grievances deepening over time.  </p><p>In the vast plains,  </p><p>It was the transition between spring and summer. A gentle breeze caressed the tender green grass, and insects began to stir. Birds and beasts joined in a symphony of nature.  </p><p>Everything appeared tranquil.  </p><p>At that moment, a cluster of white clouds sped across the sky, skimming low over the ground.  </p><p>A bird noticed the clouds and glanced upward, but it saw nothing unusual. Unaware of any anomaly, it continued its cheerful chirping.  </p><p>Within the clouds, however, were several figures, including Qin Sang, all Nascent Soul Ancestors.  </p><p>While the main armies clashed elsewhere, they had infiltrated this area with the goal of reclaiming the mineral veins seized by the Sin Abyss.  </p><p>――  </p><p>――  </p><p>I'm not particularly skilled at writing war scenes, and these chapters felt a bit rough. I hope the experience wasn't too jarring. I'll try to wrap up this arc soon.</p>
