<h1>Chapter 494: Too Long</h1><p>Perhaps the sacrifice of the three Sha corpses had worked.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised to find that Priest Jiupao's resistance was weakening, and his demonic energy began to dissipate. Qin Sang finally caught a glimpse of the priest's true form.</p><p>He was in an even more wretched state than the Night Spectre, his aura weak. Faced with the relentless assault from Qin Sang and the Night Spectre, his exhaustion was evident, and his defeat was only a matter of time.</p><p>But before Qin Sang could relax, an unexpected change occurred.</p><p>Priest Jiupao roared loudly, and the vast demonic energy suddenly collapsed inwards at an alarming speed. At the center of the demonic energy, a black vortex rapidly formed, brewing a terrifying storm.</p><p>The vortex stirred up the immense demonic energy, and Qin Sang sensed an incredibly violent aura emanating from within, its power astonishing.</p><p>Even from the edge of the battlefield, Qin Sang still felt a tremor of fear.  A sense of unease rose within him, realizing that this must be Priest Jiupao's final, desperate gamble.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to order the Night Spectre to attack fiercely,</p><p>when he realized the Night Spectre didn't need his urging.  It plunged fearlessly into the storm.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Deafening explosions echoed from within the storm.</p><p>The valley floor collapsed, and rocks tumbled down.</p><p>A look of surprise flashed across Qin Sang's eyes.  At this critical juncture, the corpse core power within the Night Spectre erupted. It actually withstood the terrifying storm, holding its ground.</p><p>Like an unmovable pillar within the demonic storm, it forcibly suppressed Priest Jiupao, giving him no opportunity to exploit.  No matter how much the priest struggled, he couldn't break free from the Night Spectre. His roars became increasingly frantic, even despairing.</p><p>While exhilarated, Qin Sang also felt a pang of distress.</p><p>The price of the Night Spectre's incredible display of power was its inability to dodge, forcing it to endure every one of Priest Jiupao's counterattacks.</p><p>The cost was too high. Already severely injured, the Night Spectre’s condition worsened. There wasn’t a single part of its body left unscathed. A palm print was deeply embedded in its abdomen, almost piercing through.</p><p>Its limbs were all damaged to varying degrees. It was only because the Night Spectre lacked consciousness and possessed a robust body that it could still persevere under these circumstances and display such remarkable fighting prowess.</p><p>Its corpse core, continuously drained of power, showed clear signs of exhaustion.</p><p>The core's luster dimmed, its operation sluggish.</p><p>Qin Sang had no idea what state the Night Spectre would be in after this battle.</p><p>Even if it could recover, it would likely take a considerable amount of time.</p><p>But Qin Sang dared not let the Night Spectre withdraw.  As long as he could obtain Priest Jiupao's Golden Core, even if the Night Spectre were destroyed here, it would be worth it!</p><p>"Die!"</p><p>Priest Jiupao suddenly roared.</p><p>Like a trapped beast's last desperate cry, filled with immense hatred, it sounded inhuman.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat as he saw the demonic storm abruptly halt.</p><p>The next moment, it exploded!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>In an instant, the valley plunged into darkness, as if eternal night had descended.</p><p>The violent demonic energy surged in all directions.  Qin Sang's mind raced, his gaze fixed on the center of the battlefield. He finally saw two dark figures being blasted away.</p><p>The Night Spectre crashed heavily into the nearby mountain, deeply embedded in the rock face.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't spare the Night Spectre another glance. He immediately focused on the other figure.</p><p>He saw Priest Jiupao smash a deep crater into the ground. Then, his body suddenly sprang up from the crater, stumbling outwards in an attempt to escape.</p><p>"He's still alive?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. Without waiting for the Night Spectre, he immediately manipulated the Ten Yama Banners to intercept.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Priest Jiupao hadn't flown far when his body suddenly stiffened and he fell heavily to the ground.</p><p>He struggled to get up, but couldn’t. It seemed as if someone was fighting him for control of his body. His body convulsed, beyond his control.</p><p>Priest Jiupao shrieked.</p><p>"What are you doing!"</p><p>"I am your master!"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred at this sight.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Priest Jiupao’s abdomen suddenly exploded, his body splitting in two, blood and flesh splattering everywhere. A flash of light shot out from his dantian. He had actually abandoned his physical body again, attempting to escape with his Golden Core.</p><p>This wasn’t the end. Just as his Golden Core emerged, a phantom-like soul shadow surged from his severed body, desperately grappling with and tearing at Priest Jiupao’s Nascent Soul, pulling at his Golden Core.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed in front of him and beckoned with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Nine Nether Demonic Fire descended, enveloping Priest Jiupao’s Golden Core.</p><p>Suddenly, chilling screams echoed from within the demonic flames.</p><p>"Who are you! I have no grievance with you, why are you killing me!"</p><p>Torn apart by Ji Wu, Priest Jiupao was left with only a remnant soul.  Unable even to self-detonate his Golden Core, he continued to cry out in defiance.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at him coldly, "Do you remember the countless wronged souls beneath the Yin Sha Abyss? They have been waiting for you in the underworld. You have lived for far too long!"</p><p>With that, Qin Sang snorted coldly and clenched his hand. The Nine Nether Demonic Fire completely devoured Priest Jiupao’s remnant soul.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>‘Clink!’</p><p>With these two crisp sounds, peace finally returned to the valley.</p><p>Only ruins remained of the once beautiful scenery.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his magical treasures and the Ten Yama Formation. He felt a wave of weakness wash over him.  Mustering his strength, he swallowed two medicinal pills. He looked down at the ground and discovered that beside Priest Jiupao’s Golden Core lay a dark iron ring.</p><p>The ring was similar in shape and size to a thumb ring, very inconspicuous, as if forged from ordinary black iron. There were even spots of rust on it.</p><p>A cursory sweep with his spiritual sense didn’t reveal anything unusual about the ring; it was easily overlooked.</p><p>However, to have survived this battle, to have been kept by Priest Jiupao throughout, even remembered during his escape, this ring couldn’t be as simple as it appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang walked over and was about to crouch down for a closer look when he suddenly sensed a faint gaze upon him. Looking up, he found that Ji Wu was still alive.</p><p>His body was severed in two, his blood staining the ground crimson, a gruesome sight.</p><p>His aura was also incredibly weak, yet he still forced his eyes open, looking at Qin Sang, clinging to life by sheer willpower.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang notice him, a flicker of pleading flashed in Ji Wu's eyes. His lips moved slightly, but he lacked the strength to speak.</p><p>His gaze became extremely urgent.</p><p>Qin Sang met Ji Wu’s gaze for a moment, understanding the meaning in his eyes.  He sighed softly, “Don't worry, I have no quarrel with Cold Mountain City. I won't harm the Ji family.”</p><p>The light in Ji Wu’s eyes rapidly faded, and he finally closed them, drawing his last breath.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Ji Wu’s corpse, lost in thought. He stood there for a while before finally crouching down, turning his attention to the two spoils of war.</p><p>Golden Cores were quite different from Demon Cores. Equally beautiful, they lacked the unsettling demonic aura.</p><p>However, the pressure of a Golden Core cultivator remained.</p><p>Moreover, with Priest Jiupao’s recent death, the Golden Core shimmered brilliantly, brimming with spiritual energy, mesmerizing.</p>
