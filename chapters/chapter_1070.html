<h1>Chapter 1622: Immortal Mountain</h1><p>“That old demon brought his men here, why haven't they made a move?”</p><p>Outside Zhenling Domain.</p><p>In a secluded mountain forest, cultivators blended seamlessly with the stone forest.</p><p>A stony tree emitted a raspy voice.</p><p>They acted with extreme caution, utilizing concealing formations to avoid revealing the slightest trace of their presence.</p><p>“The Demon Lord is after Yitian Peak. Unfortunately, that old demon is too tight-lipped. Even Yin Laomo, his trusted subordinate, knows nothing. We couldn't get any information from him after capturing him alive. It seems our previous preparations are largely useless.”</p><p>A stony tree writhed, revealing the figure of an old Daoist—Ling Zhuzi, the head of the Heavenly Dao Sect!</p><p>He looked up at Yitian Peak, his brow deeply furrowed.  He murmured, “In Zhenling Domain, even the Grand Elder will be suppressed and unable to ascend Yitian Peak. We can only ask Madam Li and I to go.”</p><p>Ling Zhuzi glanced towards a patch of petrified flowers and plants.</p><p>A flash of light appeared in the void, and a woman in palace attire emerged.</p><p>The woman possessed exceptional beauty but her expression was stern and commanding, inspiring awe and preventing any disrespectful thoughts.</p><p>Madam Li was the head of another righteous sect, the Yunxia Sect.  Originally, she was only the sect leader's wife. After the Yunxia Sect leader, Leader Li, passed away, she took over the sect.</p><p>A remarkable woman, she not only led the Yunxia Sect to new heights, but also continuously broke through cultivation barriers, reaching the peak of the Nascent Soul Mid-stage. She had become a pillar of the righteous path, renowned alongside the three major merchant alliance leaders.</p><p>She commanded respect throughout the Inner Sea, yet still preferred to be called Madam Li.</p><p>Among the righteous cultivators, she was the most likely to breakthrough to the Nascent Soul Late-stage; even the Heavenly Dao Sect's Grand Elder was inferior to her in cultivation.</p><p>Barring any unforeseen circumstances, she would become the leader of the righteous path after Ling Zhuzi's passing.</p><p>“Since Old Demon Mou isn't dead, he'll likely accompany the Demon Lord into the mountain this time, won't he?”</p><p>With only the two of them entering the mountain, their strength would be at a disadvantage compared to the demonic forces.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi said gravely, “It was already extremely difficult to force the Demon Lord to attack Old Demon Mou in the name of humanity. We thought that as long as we were fully prepared and severely wounded Old Demon Mou, even if the Demon Lord managed to protect him, he wouldn't be able to change the situation, so we didn't press him further. However, I found an opportunity to use a secret technique to damage his foundation. He won't recover for a while. We have the element of surprise. Our chances of winning are still considerable…”</p><p>At this moment, another tree shadow swayed, and a Daoist silently emerged.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi handed a seal to the Daoist. “Grand Elder, I'll leave this formation in your hands. Respond as needed…”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The Daoist replied.</p><p>……</p><p>On Yitian Peak.</p><p>Before a sheer cliff.</p><p>Clouds and mist swirled.</p><p>Pavilions and towers were built among the rocks, hinting at former grandeur.</p><p>Now, deprived of ancient protections, they were dilapidated, the immortal realm reduced to the mundane.</p><p>The stream was dry, the rocks exposed, a broken bridge stretched halfway across the valley, pointing towards the cliff.</p><p>Judging by the traces here, there might have once been a magnificent, thousand-meter-high waterfall, a celestial river cascading down endlessly.</p><p>Amidst the fog, three figures arrived one after another—an elder and two young people, the descendants of the Four Saints, who had just finished refining Soul-Washing Liquid in the trial realm!</p><p>The young man and woman were only at the late stage of Core Formation, yet they could move freely on Yitian Peak, in the heart of Zhenling Domain. If others saw them, they would be astonished.</p><p>“This will be the last place I show you, and also the most crucial part of our ancestors’ teachings!  Remember every word I say carefully. This is the mission of our Four Saints Palace.”</p><p>The elder stood with his hands behind his back, gazing up at the cliff.  He paused, about to step forward, then said, “Once you're inside, don’t remove your protective talismans. Your current cultivation is too low, and Zhenling Domain is far too dangerous for you. Without the protection of the talismans, you will instantly perish.”</p><p>“Disciple obeys!”</p><p>The young man and woman were inwardly awestruck.</p><p>On their chests were jade-scepter-shaped talismans formed of green light threads, clinging tightly to their bodies.</p><p>During their journey, they had followed their master, witnessed countless ruins, and heard countless inspiring stories, leaving their minds in a state of lingering wonder.</p><p>The elder approached the cliff, drew a talisman in the air, and then squeezed out a drop of essence blood, injecting it into the talisman.</p><p>The blood talisman sank into the stone wall.</p><p>A strangely complex restriction suddenly appeared on the originally unremarkable cliff. The blood talisman merged into the restriction, opening a gap, like a door.</p><p>The three of them entered one after another.</p><p>……</p><p>Above the Immortal Restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang, accompanied by Ning Wuhu, walked along the jade corridor.</p><p>The path was unexpectedly long. Qin Sang suspected they had gone beyond the Zhen Ling domain, yet the end remained unseen, only endless clouds and mist ahead.</p><p>His mind was constantly tense.  The surroundings were simply too dangerous.  The sky and the ground were filled with swirling celestial barriers and surging spirit tides. The white jade corridor seemed thin and fragile, on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang searched frantically but found no similar corridors. This path had no branches; there was nowhere else to go.</p><p>He followed Ning Wu Hui for a while longer, finally reaching the end and seeing a white jade platform.</p><p>“A celestial palace?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, but upon closer inspection, it didn't match the images of celestial palaces he'd seen before.</p><p>“It’s Yi Tian Peak!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, his gaze piercing through the clouds and mist, to vaguely see something in the distance.  It was a celestial mountain resembling a pillar of heaven—the portion of Yi Tian Peak submerged within the celestial barriers. It was magnificent and imposing, yet its summit remained unseen.</p><p>The platform was built on a protruding rock, like an observation deck.  However, the platform was now engulfed in clouds and mist, and the mountain below was desolate, offering no scenic view.</p><p>The two quickly ascended the platform and found two sets of stairs, one on each side, extending from the platform in different directions. One was intact, winding downwards around the mountain. The other was broken just below the platform.</p><p>“Go down this way.” Ning Wu Hui pointed to the complete corridor.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, stared at the broken stairs. “Where does this path lead?”  If this place connected to an ancient teleportation array, and Ning Wu Hui's path led down the mountain, then this might lead to the array!</p><p>“I don't know.” Ning Wu Hui shook her head.</p><p>Qin Sang approached, meticulously examining every corner. Unlike before, the break didn't affect the celestial barriers. It was still incredibly dangerous, revealing no flaws or exits. He activated his celestial eye ability, only to find a blank mountain wall ahead, suggesting there might never have been a path there.</p><p>“Sigh! We have to wait for Elder Qing Zhu to appear before we know the way out…”</p><p>Resigned, Qin Sang turned to follow Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>The white jade corridor followed the mountain, winding through forests and valleys. Finally, it sharply turned downwards.  The long stone steps were almost vertical.</p><p>Descending, the glow of the celestial barriers flashed before their eyes. Spirit tides surged like a tsunami, seemingly about to crash into them, only to be stopped by the corridor.</p><p>Qin Sang broke into a cold sweat, carefully inching downwards until he finally reached the bottom, letting out a sigh of relief.</p>
