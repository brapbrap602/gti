<h1>Chapter 1963: Revenge</h1><p>Sand, like scattered stones in water.</p><p>A descendant of the Sha family, yet living like a stray dog, barely surviving, still unable to reveal their true identity.  The Stone surname…</p><p>Or rather, a young man surnamed Sha, shifted his gaze from Bai Li Qingkong to the numerous Yin family members, and to Nian Hui!</p><p>Among them all, perhaps only the Yin family had not added to the Sha family’s downfall.</p><p>But he and the Yin family, and the fourth Yin family miss of that time, the current Nian Hui, share a very deep connection!</p><p>However, the Sha family youth showed no special treatment towards the Yin family members.  At this moment, everyone, including Nian Hui, was merely a pawn in his hands!</p><p>The Sha family youth’s eyes flashed, then he vanished without a trace.</p><p>The underground tunnels were like a net, constantly shaking, in utter chaos, yet the Sha family youth was unaffected, silently speeding through the labyrinth.</p><p>Soon, he entered a tunnel.  Ahead, he heard the sounds of colliding magical arts, along with angry shouts and cries.</p><p>At the end of the tunnel, two groups suddenly met, colliding unexpectedly.</p><p>The two groups were cultivators from Hanjiu Valley and Yu Family of Parrot Mountain.</p><p>A sudden change occurred, everyone's minds tightened, instinctively taking self-protective measures, and almost immediately, they started fighting.</p><p>Hanjiu Valley and Parrot Mountain already harbored animosity towards each other.  Seeing each other’s identities, they not only didn’t stop, but instead roared angrily and fiercely attacked each other.</p><p>The Hanjiu Valley cultivators were all skilled in the use of ice needles.</p><p>Attacking together, hundreds or thousands of ice needles shot towards the enemy, their tails trailing blue cold air, like surging ice flames—a spectacular sight.</p><p>Compared to Hanjiu Valley, the Yu family cultivators were fewer in number.</p><p>The Parrot Mountain Yu family were experts in spiritual formations, but the narrow terrain was highly disadvantageous to them.  Their formations were disrupted by the sudden change, and they had no time to reorganize.  As soon as the battle started, they fell behind.</p><p>“Kill them! Don’t let a single one escape!”</p><p>Someone from Hanjiu Valley shouted excitedly.</p><p>A rare opportunity: to kill all these Yu family cultivators here, without anyone knowing who did it.</p><p>If the Yu family knew the secret of the Tianmai Sect, they must be eliminated!</p><p>Hanjiu Valley’s offensive suddenly intensified, incredibly fierce.  The Yu family cultivators were caught in a difficult situation, and soon found themselves in dire straits.</p><p>This was exactly what the Sha family youth wanted to see.</p><p>He hid in the shadows, watching coldly, like a venomous snake waiting to strike.</p><p>In other parts of the ruins, similar situations were unfolding.</p><p>Some had previous grudges, some were fighting over Tianmai Sect treasures, and others started fighting over minor disagreements.</p><p>In the dark depths, killing was everywhere.</p><p>Among them, the most intense battle was at the Yin family’s location.</p><p>Yin Heqian and Bai Li Qingkong were already locked in combat.</p><p>The aftershocks from the battle between the two Yuan Ying stage cultivators were enough to deter others from getting close.</p><p>The other Yin family members and the rest of the Bai Li clan could only create their own battlefronts.</p><p>Normally, the Bai Li clan, with only three people, wouldn't be able to withstand the Yin family, but shortly after the engagement, other factions arrived one after another.</p><p>The Yin family, which had triggered the initial change and possessed the strongest strength, immediately became the target of everyone’s attack, falling into an encirclement.</p><p>Yin Heqian and Bai Li Qingkong were entangled, unable to escape.</p><p>All the Yin family members gathered around Nian Hui, working together to defend against the enemy, but Nian Hui, who should have been the pillar of support, was somewhat dazed, causing the Yin family side to face life-threatening danger.</p><p>“Nian Hui!”</p><p>An elder of the Yin family shouted anxiously.</p><p>Nian Hui’s vacant eyes finally flickered, as if waking from a dream.</p><p>The bitterness in her heart grew stronger.</p><p>Her gaze swept around, then turned towards the bottom of the well.  Nian Hui tried to find him, that familiar yet strange figure, but found nothing.</p><p>Her gaze paused for a moment upon Bai Li Qingkong.</p><p>The Sha family, the Bai Li clan…</p><p>She remembered that year, how the Yin family stood by and watched the Bai Li clan annihilate the Sha family, including her.</p><p>Although, at that time, she was under house arrest by the family.</p><p>But Nian Hui couldn’t convince herself, she dared not imagine his despair back then.</p><p>But she couldn’t do anything, she couldn’t even be by his side.</p><p>All their vows became a joke.</p><p>Those memories were like nightmares, haunting her, tormenting her, sleepless nights, until this day.</p><p>Nian Hui had thought that this time, the other party was merely using the Yin family’s power to open the Tianmai Sect ruins and obtain the Tianmai Sect’s inheritance, and willingly cooperating with them was a way to atone for her sins.</p><p>Seeing Bai Li Qingkong, Nian Hui finally understood.</p><p>Indeed, they wouldn't forgive her so easily.</p><p>At this moment, unseen eyes seemed to watch her, silently demanding: What will you do this time?</p><p>"Are you watching me?"</p><p>Nian Hui's lips moved, a silent question, but received no answer.</p><p>In that instant, she made her decision, communicating telepathically with her clansmen.</p><p>The Yin clan members agreed to Nian Hui's proposal.</p><p>An elder of the Yin clan cautioned, "Good, let's act quickly before things worsen! Nian Hui, be wary of Bai Li Qingkong. That man possesses insidious and mysterious abilities!"</p><p>The Yin clansmen secretly activated their magical arts.</p><p>The next moment, the Yin clan formation shifted dramatically.  Everyone produced an identical token.</p><p>The tokens were wooden, with naturally formed wood grain resembling a real tree, exquisitely detailed.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The tokens flew into the air.</p><p>Instantly, a vibrant green light erupted, carrying a fresh scent that dispelled the heavy, earthy atmosphere.</p><p>The green light enveloped everyone on the battlefield, except for the two Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>Before the enemy could react, roots sprouted from the ground above them, transforming into lush, sturdy trees, as real as any.</p><p>These trees rooted themselves above everyone, swaying gently.</p><p>An overwhelming pressure descended, inescapable and binding.</p><p>Almost all the enemies stiffened, their spiritual energy momentarily disrupted.</p><p>"The Immobilizing Mountain God Tree!"</p><p>Someone cried out, identifying the magical ability, but it was too late.</p><p>Including the three Bai Li clan members, their ferocious attack faltered, creating an opening that gave the Yin clan a chance to breathe.</p><p>This was the moment Nian Hui had been waiting for.</p><p>Without hesitation, she stamped her right foot on the ground, a green light exploding outwards, producing dozens of emerald vines.</p><p>The vines, though slender, were incredibly tough, whipping towards the enemy like steel whips, their sharp sound causing fear.</p><p>Using the vines, Nian Hui broke through the encirclement, escaping the trap.  She wrapped herself in the vines and plummeted downwards.</p><p>*Thwack!*</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>In an instant, several attacks followed, all intercepted by the vines.</p><p>The vines shattered, Nian Hui’s breath ragged, but she was unharmed.</p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p>A furious roar erupted nearby.</p><p>Nian Hui felt an intense heat engulfing her, like molten lava, turning the vine fragments to ash, and singeing her hair.</p><p>Yet, Nian Hui showed no fear, her descent only accelerating.</p><p>On another part of the battlefield...</p><p>Simultaneously with Nian Hui's move, Yin He Qian unleashed his long-prepared spell. A gray light shot from his sleeve, transforming into a blade of light, aiming for Bai Li Qingkong's head.</p><p>However, Bai Li Qingkong was even more formidable. He didn't dodge the blade of light.  A golden light flashed from his chest, releasing a golden necklace with a crimson gemstone pendant.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The gemstone shattered.</p><p>A deafening roar echoed.</p><p>A giant turtle, formed entirely of flames, materialized. Its shell was unusually deep in color, the flames somehow heavy and substantial.</p><p>The turtle shielded Bai Li Qingkong completely.</p><p>*Thwack!*</p><p>The blade of light struck the turtle, causing a massive wave of fire.  The turtle was nearly split in two, but the blade's power was significantly weakened, no longer a threat to Bai Li Qingkong.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong, fully confident in the turtle, ignored the blade completely!</p><p>Yin He Qian, never expecting such an easy defense, was alarmed. If Bai Li Qingkong attacked Nian Hui, she would be in extreme danger!</p><p>"Watch out!"</p><p>Yin He Qian shouted, forcefully shaking his sleeve, releasing a large net towards Bai Li Qingkong in a desperate attempt to intervene.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong sneered, dodging the net with a lunge forward. Simultaneously, a crimson light shot from his waist, engulfing the surroundings in a sea of fire.</p><p>Nian Hui, surrounded by flames, struggled desperately, her eyes filled with terror.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong, his eyes filled with murderous intent, flicked a crimson spike towards Nian Hui.</p><p>The spike, formed from intensely condensed flames, was incredibly sharp and fast, hurtling towards Nian Hui’s vital point.</p><p>Just then, the panic on Nianhui's face vanished.  Facing the fiery spear, she neither dodged nor evaded.  Her right hand opened, revealing a green orb the size of a baby's fist.</p><p>"Yi Mu Qingt ian Lei!"</p><p>Yin Heqian's pupils constricted.</p><p>The Yi Mu Qingt ian Lei was a prized possession of the Yin family,  only craftable by those with extremely high mastery of the family's core techniques, and requiring immense effort and time. It was not something created lightly.</p><p>Nianhui's orb was a gift from the previous family head, their father, meant as a form of protection, a kind of recompense.</p><p>Seeing Nianhui produce the Yi Mu Qingt ian Lei, Yin Heqian was not pleased, but alarmed.</p><p>The Yi Mu Qingt ian Lei possessed immense power, but if activated by someone other than its creator, it would cause a backlash, inflicting severe injury on the user.</p><p>Using it at this moment might not severely wound Bai Li Qingkong, but it would be tantamount to suicide for Nianhui.</p><p>"No! Fourth Sister, get out of the way!" Yin Heqian roared.</p><p>But Nianhui ignored him.  Holding the Yi Mu Qingt ian Lei, she channeled her energy into it. Green lightning crackled across the orb's surface.</p><p>Soundlessly, the orb exploded.</p><p>Green light filled the space, coating everyone in a green protective layer.</p><p>Then, a deafening roar of thunder followed.</p><p>A subterranean earthquake shook the earth, surpassing even the ground tremors.</p><p>The fiery spear was detonated by the Yi Mu Qingt ian Lei.  Lightning and fire, intertwined, engulfed Nianhui at point-blank range.</p><p>Until the very end, Nianhui showed no fear or regret.</p><p>"Is this enough?"</p><p>Nianhui asked silently, a look of relief on her face.</p><p>Somewhere underground,</p><p>A young man surnamed Sha watched.  At the moment Nianhui detonated the Yi Mu Qingt ian Lei, he hesitated, but ultimately refrained from intervening.</p><p>As Nianhui disappeared into the maelstrom of lightning and fire, the young man's fingers twitched.  A hint of regret flickered in his expression, and he sighed softly.</p><p>Upon meeting Nianhui at Qingyang Temple, he had discerned her mindset and decided to use her for his revenge.</p><p>But now, having achieved his goal, he realized that while he could pursue revenge relentlessly, he couldn't completely extinguish his inherent compassion.</p><p>"Bai Li Qingkong, I will kill you!"</p><p>Yin Heqian roared, ignoring the lingering effects of the Yi Mu Qingt ian Lei, charging forward.  His body glowed green, transforming into a towering ancient tree as he slammed into his opponent.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong, struggling to withstand the Yi Mu Qingt ian Lei, was hit by a tremendous impact.  Pain wracked his chest, and his face went pale as death.</p><p>"Pfft!"</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong spat blood.  His armor absorbed the brunt of the force, but his body twisted violently as he was flung aside.</p><p>Abandoning the pursuit of Bai Li Qingkong, Yin Heqian reached into the heart of the lightning and fire, retrieving a limp body.</p><p>Nianhui's robes were severely damaged. Chaotic energy from the lightning and flames raged within her, causing widespread destruction. Her eyes were closed; she appeared dead.</p><p>After a brief examination, Yin Heqian's eyes lit up with surprise.</p><p>Nianhui still had a faint pulse!</p><p>The Yi Mu Qingt ian Lei may have buffered the force of the fiery spear, saving her.</p><p>However, her internal injuries were severe. He could help dispel the lightning, but the spear's energy was strange and difficult to suppress.</p><p>Yin Heqian cradled Nianhui, gently touching her several times.  Suddenly, he sensed danger; a tree-like projection burst from his body, blocking Bai Li Qingkong's sneak attack.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong wiped the blood from his lips.  His injury had shaken his composure.  He eyed Yin Heqian warily, then glanced at Nianhui, sneering, "So this is the reclusive Fourth Miss Yin? To allow my poison to enter your body... unless the Yin family head personally purifies her, she'll be dead within moments."</p><p>"Good! Good! Good!  I shall remember your methods, my friend!"</p><p>Yin Heqian gritted his teeth, repeating "good" three times.</p><p>At that moment, a violent tremor shook the well below.  Several orbs of light flickered, revealing a magical seal disturbed by their battle.  A storm erupted from the well's depths.</p><p>The storm's power was extraordinary; everyone was caught off guard and scattered.</p><p>Though he suspected the emergence of a Tianmai Sect treasure, Yin Heqian prioritized saving Nianhui and retreated.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong seized the opportunity, checking his surroundings before activating his protective talisman and diving into the heart of the storm.</p><p>...</p><p>Elsewhere, the fighting continued, escalating in intensity.</p><p>Few noticed that the blood of the fallen was seeping into the ground, flowing into stone pools, staining murals in crimson.</p><p>(End)</p>
