<h1>Chapter 734: Reunion</h1><p>The closer Qin Sang got to Muyuan Island, the more alarmed he became.</p><p>The scale of the beast horde was even larger than he had imagined, and chaos reigned ahead.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang hesitated, but ultimately decided to check the situation on Muyuan Island. After Jinyuan Island was overrun by the beast tide, the Qiongyu Trading Company focused on Muyuan Island, making it highly likely that the Wang sisters were there.</p><p>If they were alert enough, they should have detected the approaching horde and taken precautions.</p><p>However, the islanders were unaware of the terrifying scale of this beast tide. If they couldn't evacuate in time, they risked being surrounded and killed by the ever-increasing number of demonic beasts.</p><p>On the way, some demonic beasts spotted him and gave chase. Fortunately, none were powerful, and Qin Sang easily left them behind.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed on relentlessly, with his two-headed… (creature name omitted as per instructions) until finally Muyuan Island came into view.</p><p>Seeing the scene on Muyuan Island from afar, Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Demons beasts swarmed everywhere, a sea of black pressing down, completely surrounding the island. In the heart of the battlefield, besides the constant roar of beasts, there were also cries of battle – many cultivators were trapped.</p><p>Qin Sang approached the island with his two-headed… (creature name omitted as per instructions), reaching the edge of the battlefield.  He saw countless strangely shaped sea beasts, like a swarm of ants.</p><p>These sea beasts were fearless and though individually weak, their sheer numbers were enough to make even Qin Sang's scalp tingle.</p><p>“Boom! Boom!”</p><p>A series of booming sounds came from the beast tide. Qin Sang looked closely and saw several Foundation Establishment cultivators jointly powering a shuttle-shaped artifact, struggling to break out.</p><p>Two men and two women, all at the late Foundation Establishment stage. The shuttle-shaped artifact was unique, capable of being powered by four people, unleashing tremendous power.</p><p>A single charge could wipe out a large number of demonic beasts.</p><p>They were about to break through, but the beasts continuously replenished their numbers, preventing them from escaping.</p><p>To make matters worse, powering the shuttle was extremely draining. Two of them were pale and unsteady, seemingly unable to hold on much longer.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang gave instructions to his two-headed… (creature name omitted as per instructions), and both sped up significantly.</p><p>Reaching the outer edge of the battlefield, the two-headed… (creature name omitted as per instructions) unleashed a storm from its vertical pupils, sweeping across the area. The sea beasts were easily annihilated by the storm.</p><p>“A Core Formation demonic beast!”</p><p>The four cultivators saw the storm heading towards them, and sensing its power, despair filled their faces.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the storm dissipated just before reaching them. Then, a sword light, like a dragon, shot out from the storm's remnants.</p><p>To the astonishment of the four, the sword light effortlessly beheaded the surrounding beasts.</p><p>The four immediately realized they had encountered a benefactor. Overjoyed, they fled.</p><p>“Thank you, senior, for saving our lives!”</p><p>The four, having narrowly escaped death, hurriedly bowed to Qin Sang, their faces filled with gratitude.</p><p>“Is that… senior's spirit beast?”</p><p>A woman stared in shock at the two-headed… (creature name omitted as per instructions).</p><p>Upon seeing how docile the two-headed… (creature name omitted as per instructions) was, she realised that such a powerful demonic beast was Qin Sang's tamed spirit beast, further enhancing their impression of him.</p><p>It had been a while since the incident at Fire Stealing Island, and there had been no news from Hutian Island, and the two-headed… (creature name omitted as per instructions) had been kept hidden.</p><p>“What happened? Why are so many people trapped on the island? Was there no warning before the beast tide arrived?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked sternly, pressing for details about the island's situation.</p><p>At this moment, the beast tide turned its attention to them and attacked. Qin Sang had no choice but to summon his Flying Night Rakshasa to fight alongside his two-headed… (creature name omitted as per instructions).</p><p>Faced with the overwhelming beast tide, the four cultivators turned pale, but dared not leave, honestly answering Qin Sang’s questions.</p><p>“Reporting to senior, some did initially detect signs of the beast tide. However, just as the news spread, a group of Core Formation demonic beasts suddenly appeared on the island, savagely attacking the protective array.  Caught off guard, the array couldn't withstand the assault and was broken in moments, causing chaos on the island. Everyone could only fight for themselves. Many, like us, couldn't escape in time before the beast tide arrived…”</p><p>After learning this, Qin Sang understood.</p><p>The cultivators of Wu Yuan Island never expected to withstand the beast tide; their formations were merely a stopgap measure. The leader of this beast tide was highly intelligent, exploiting the cultivators' weaknesses.</p><p>“Did you see anyone from the Dongji Alliance when you left the city?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Facing the natural disaster, the various merchant guilds of the Dongji Alliance would certainly have gathered together first.  It's uncertain whether they managed to escape.</p><p>The four exchanged glances. A woman hesitated, "With respect, seniors, on leaving the city I believe I saw two Wang stewards heading in that direction. I haven't seen them since."</p><p>The others shook their heads.</p><p>The Wang sisters, managing the Qiongyu Merchant Guild in their brother's stead, were very well-known. Most cultivators on Wu Yuan Island recognized them and considered them lucky charms.</p><p>Three years ago, Wang Xiang successfully formed her golden core.</p><p>Incidentally, Wang Xiang's golden core breakthrough was fortunate. Qin Sang used her connections to help them buy high-grade demonic beast pills. Wang Xiang failed several times after taking several pills.  With her internal demonic energy nearing the limit, she took one more pill and luckily formed her golden core.  The twin sisters both achieving golden core cultivation became a celebrated tale.</p><p>Looking in the direction indicated by the woman, Qin Sang's heart sank. That was precisely where the beast tide had struck – countless demonic beasts, relentless and unending.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, speeding away.</p><p>The four didn't dare linger, leaving hastily.</p><p>Qin Sang herself didn't dare charge in recklessly, ordering her two-headed… creature to search. After searching, the two-headed… creature finally located the Wang sisters and some cultivators from other merchant guilds of the Dongji Alliance.</p><p>They were trapped by the beasts, in a sorry state, having suffered significant losses.</p><p>Fortunately, the Wang sisters had both broken through to the Golden Core stage; otherwise, their fate would have been far worse.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A huge sea beast, the two-headed…, appeared before them, letting out a low roar, signaling them to follow.  It then split into six figures, turning to face the beast tide, baring its fangs.</p><p>"It's Daoist Master's spirit beast!"</p><p>The Wang sisters, their initial weariness replaced by surprise at the sight of the two-headed…, shouted excitedly.</p><p>"Daoist Master has come to save us! Follow!"</p><p>At once, the group's spirits soared, following the two-headed….</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang appeared at the edge of the beast tide, summoning the Ten Directions Yama Banner and unleashing demonic fire to create an opening, connecting with them.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld demonic fire formed a blazing dragon, sweeping all before it, cutting a path through the beasts, allowing them to see each other.</p><p>"Daoist Master…"</p><p>Wang Xiang jumped and waved, her voice clear and bright. Wang Shi also beamed with joy.</p><p>Rejoining in the midst of the beast tide, the group was somewhat dazed.  They had thought most of them would die, but to escape death felt unreal.</p>
