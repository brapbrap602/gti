<h1>Chapter 1544: External Nascent Soul</h1><p>The two stood before the stone forest.</p><p>“It's here! Through the stone forest, not far, is the valley.”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui observed for a moment, then stepped into the stone forest, gesturing for Qin Sang to follow.</p><p>A gloomy wind blew through the forest, unable to move the petrified trees, but as they passed through, it produced harsh, strange sounds, sometimes sharp, sometimes a low, mournful wail.</p><p>“Ferocious beasts inhabit this stone forest, Fellow Daoist Qin, be careful. The stone trees are dense, your movement techniques will be restricted.”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui’s voice transmitted through a sound transmission.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, secretly awakening the Skyeye Butterfly for vigilance.</p><p>They slowed their pace, silently moving through the forest. Fortunately, they encountered no danger until they reached the depths of the stone forest.</p><p>Gradually, the stone trees began to thin.</p><p>After traveling a further distance, Qin Sang suddenly heard a strange whimpering sound, as if someone was crying in pain ahead.</p><p>At first, the sound was faint, and after walking for so long in the stone forest, they had grown accustomed to strange noises, assuming it was just the wind blowing through the treetops.</p><p>But as they continued, the crying not only persisted but grew louder. In such a place, it was no different from the wails of a ghost, sending chills down their spines.</p><p>They exchanged a glance, realizing something was amiss with the sound, and a sense of dread crept over them.</p><p>The crying came from directly ahead. The stone forest obstructed their view in the dim light, and they couldn't see anything, nor did they dare to use their divine sense to probe.</p><p>“Could there be a Ghost King level specter in the inner hall?”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui shook his head. “I’ve never heard such rumors. Many Nascent Soul cultivators have perished in the inner hall, but none have become ghosts. The only living things inside are various ferocious beasts, and at most, when opening some hidden realms, one might find guardian puppets… Let's take a detour!”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui made a prompt decision, unwilling to risk it, preferring to go around.</p><p>However, just then, the ghostly wails intensified, seemingly moving towards them.</p><p>Their expressions changed drastically, and they immediately darted in another direction, avoiding the unknown entity.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>A sudden roar of collapsing rocks came from ahead. The entity had discovered them! It accelerated, smashing through stone trees as it charged towards them.</p><p>Stone trees collapsed in succession, creating chaos.</p><p>At the same time, they finally sensed a trace of the entity's aura.</p><p>“A peak-level beast!”</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed in shock.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly’s vision pierced through the dust and smoke, revealing a dark figure. It was a giant, night owl-like beast, its aura terrifying.</p><p>The night owl’s fierce eyes locked onto them, radiating a cruel, bloodthirsty glint.</p><p>“This kind of beast should dwell in the depths of the valley. How did it appear here?!”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui gasped in disbelief.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly discovered the night owl's abnormality. “Look at its wounds! This night owl might have been severely injured… and escaped all the way here!”</p><p>The night owl appeared normal, but on its chest, where a small patch of feathers was missing, there was a clear sword wound that had pierced it through.</p><p>“A single sword piercing the body of a top-level beast, scaring it into fleeing here… The one who struck this blow is definitely no ordinary Nascent Soul Grandmaster!”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui's expression turned grave. “I don't know what happened in the valley. Fellow Daoist Qin, you go first. I'll lure it away, and we'll meet again outside the stone forest.”</p><p>The night owl forcefully broke through countless stone trees, rapidly closing in on them.</p><p>The ghostly wails grew more piercing, as if they could penetrate their minds and disrupt their souls.</p><p>With the situation urgent, Ning Wu Hui swiftly made arrangements, preparing to personally lure away the night owl and let Qin Sang escape first.</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely surprised. Although injured, the night owl was a Nascent Soul level being. Even if they joined forces, fighting it would be extremely dangerous. Did Ning Wu Hui have some sort of advantage?</p><p>With only the last leg of the journey remaining, he didn't want anything to happen to Ning Wu Hui here.</p><p>The "Commanding Thunder Technique" could threaten a Nascent Soul.</p><p>In addition, for safety's sake, he had also lent the Star Conch to Bai beforehand.</p><p>Bai had been lacking a good defensive magic treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed the Demonic Banner, the Sword Wheel, and the Commanding Thunder Technique, each possessing immense power but also requiring a significant amount of energy. When facing a powerful enemy, he rarely had the opportunity to use them all in succession.  Therefore, he had temporarily lent the Star Conch to Bai for emergencies.</p><p>With Bai's higher cultivation level, the Star Conch would be even more powerful in her hands.</p><p>The "Commanding Thunder Technique" and the Star Conch, used simultaneously, could unleash a considerable burst of power, representing his greatest trump card for this journey.</p><p>However, the Star Conch only had one use, and Bai shouldered the important task of obtaining the Soul Cleansing Liquid, so he refrained from using it in the Bewildering Cave.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, about to speak.</p><p>But then he saw Ning Wu Hui swipe his hand across his forehead, and a fist-sized figure leaped out. With features resembling Ning Wu Hui and a lively expression, it was a miniature version of him.</p><p>“Nascent Soul!”</p><p>Qin Sang was instantly stunned, unable to believe his eyes.</p><p>No wonder he had felt pressure emanating from Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>He felt a sense of unreality. He never would have imagined that Ning Wu Hui had broken through to the Nascent Soul stage within the Trial Realm!</p><p>The difficulty of forming a Nascent Soul was known to all, especially the terrifying Nascent Soul Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Even with the protection of the Jade Buddha, he himself wouldn't dare to be careless and would make every preparation.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui took a stroll through the Trial Realm, found some kind of spiritual herb, and formed his Nascent Soul effortlessly, showing no signs of having gone through a near-death experience or a tribulation.</p><p>In such a short time, it wouldn't even be enough to stabilize one's cultivation, yet he showed no signs of weakness.</p><p>When did forming a Nascent Soul become so easy?</p><p>Even stranger, why did Ning Wu Hui choose the taboo action of Nascent Soul separation, and why was his main body's aura still at the late Core Formation stage?</p><p>Ning Wu Hui's Nascent Soul was cute and delicate, but its expression, like its main body's, was solemn and imposing as it faced the night owl.</p><p>The night owl stared intently at the Nascent Soul, and greed filled its fierce eyes.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin, go quickly! This is an External Nascent Soul I refined using a secret technique. It has significant limitations. I can escape easily, but I can't protect you during the fight."</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep look at Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>This person actually possessed such a secret technique. An External Nascent Soul was still a Nascent Soul, which was why Ning Wu Hui dared to face the night owl alone.</p><p>Despite his countless questions, he knew this wasn't the time to delve into them. Once the battle began, it might attract more beasts, and it was best to follow Ning Wu Hui's instructions so as not to be a burden.</p><p>“Be careful, Fellow Daoist! Remember not to engage for too long!”</p><p>Qin Sang decisively activated his movement technique, his body flashing with light as he dashed in another direction, disappearing into the depths of the stone forest in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The night owl was completely captivated by Ning Wu Hui and showed no intention of pursuing Qin Sang.</p><p>At the last moment, Qin Sang turned his head and witnessed Ning Wu Hui making his move.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui's Nascent Soul opened its small mouth and spat out a miniature spirit sword, the same crimson-gold spirit sword he had used to kill the strange bird earlier.</p><p>The same spirit sword, the same master, yet the two attacks possessed drastically different auras.</p><p>The crimson-gold spirit sword grew in size as it met the wind, its light illuminating the stone forest. It shot forward like a meteor.</p><p>The next moment, a sharp, ghostly shriek echoed, carrying a hint of pain and rage.</p><p>The ground trembled.</p><p>The stone forest crumbled.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed repeatedly, distancing himself from the battlefield.</p>
