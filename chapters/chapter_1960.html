<h1>Chapter 1951: The Hunt</h1><p>The Fire Domain.</p><p>Here, even the wind takes the shape of flame.</p><p>Blazing infernos, like flames dancing on the surface of magma, roar past.</p><p>Above and below, the only color is crimson.</p><p>Occasionally, in the magma, one can glimpse fleeting, strangely shaped figures—like ripples in the molten sea.</p><p>This is a pure ocean of magma, devoid of land. Only fire beasts with unique bloodlines, and fire spirits born of the flames, can survive here.  They fearlessly navigate this environment, moving through the magma like fish in water.</p><p>Suddenly, the fiery wind stills for a moment, revealing two ethereal figures.</p><p>These two are Ling Shi and Gui Hou.</p><p>A fiery jade centipede coils around Gui Hou’s arm, seemingly communicating with him.  He then points downwards.</p><p>“Ling Shi, it’s here!  Lord Zhu Que mentioned that some Black Demon Lilies grow beneath this magma.  I wonder if their medicinal properties meet your requirements.”</p><p>“Black Demon Lilies thrive where the fiery energy is most intense and volatile. They absorb fire poison as nourishment; their environment greatly affects their quality.  If I were using them myself, superior-grade Black Demon Lilies would suffice. However, this is for a fierce poison the senior requires, demanding the finest quality.”</p><p>Ling Shi gently twitches his nostrils, using a secret technique to sense the surroundings, then nods.  “This place is good; it has the potential to nurture top-grade Black Demon Lilies. Let's go down and take a look!”</p><p>The two plunge downwards.  The magma parts to let them through, instantly closing again to its normal state.</p><p>The magma is bottomless.</p><p>Gui Hou leads the way, descending continuously, and transmits his voice, "Ling Shi, how many top-grade lilies do you think this entire patch will yield at most? How many do we need for the poison?"</p><p>"The more, the better!" Ling Shi replies.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Gui Hou frowns.  “In the entire Fire Domain, such places are probably rare. Once a certain scale is reached, they are likely to be enclosed. The three major sects of the Fire Domain are all proficient in fire-elemental techniques, and there are many other large and small forces. Even if they don't cultivate Black Demon Lilies, they can still cultivate other herbs.”</p><p>“Let's do our best.  There are other options! Besides, the senior has immense power, surely he has a way. If he wants to unify the Fire Domain, wouldn't it be easy as pie?” Ling Shi says lightly.</p><p>Brought back by Qin Sang, Ling Shi was initially apprehensive, but now he feels at ease.</p><p>Here, he can focus on his poison arts, researching various potent poisons; whatever requirements he has, Qin Sang will fully support him.</p><p>This kind of treatment is usually reserved for master alchemists.</p><p>Although there's a saying that alchemy and poison arts are inseparable, Ling Shi does know some alchemy, but his poison cultivation isn't purely focused on making poisons, and he lacks an alchemic lineage, so he is not on par with a true master alchemist.</p><p>The price is restricted freedom, but he has already been targeted by the Soul Devouring Abyss; he has no choice.</p><p>Gui Hou cannot be as carefree as Ling Shi. He shakes his head. "While that's true, as subordinates, we must do our best to alleviate the Master's worries."</p><p>As they speak, they descend to an extreme depth.</p><p>The temperature doesn't decrease; instead, the intense and volatile energy of creation becomes even stronger.</p><p>Gradually, the magma becomes indistinguishable, transforming into pure streams of fire flowing from all directions.</p><p>It's unimaginable what kind of apocalyptic scene would result if this power were to erupt.</p><p>"Fire Domain cultivators call this place a Yan Pool, where the fiery energy undergoes transformation. Even in a powerful Yan Pool, we must be cautious.  The Black Demon Lilies are connected to the Yan Pool's energy; we must be careful when harvesting them, lest we trigger its eruption."</p><p>Gui Hou warns.</p><p>As they descend further, slowing their speed, the surrounding scenery changes dramatically.  Even these two Transcendence Stage experts feel an instinctive pressure.</p><p>Without warning, the surroundings suddenly calm.</p><p>There is no turbulence whatsoever.</p><p>Yet, this tranquility is unnerving, as if immense power is building up, ready to erupt and destroy everything.</p><p>There is fire here, burning quietly. The flames are a faint blue, gently swaying, giving a fragile impression.</p><p>They carefully enter this space, avoiding the flames, and soon find a shadowy area within the blue fire.</p><p>The shadows aren't completely dark; they radiate a dark blue light.</p><p>Amidst the radiant glow, scattered sparsely, were flowers resembling lilies.  Their petals were a dark blue, some deep, some lighter in shade.</p><p>There was no soil; they floated, their roots clearly visible, countless blue tendrils extending into the flames, drawing sustenance from the fire.</p><p>“One, two… there are five superior Black Devil Lilies!”</p><p>Ling Shi’s face lit up; he'd expected at most two or three.</p><p>He darted to a superior Black Devil Lily, his right hand reaching for the root ball.</p><p>His fingers moved lightly, a strange energy emanating from his fingertips, enveloping the root ball.</p><p>Ling Shi, completely focused, moved gently yet decisively, carefully supporting the root ball, then patiently, one by one, extracting the tendrils from the flames.</p><p>Harvesting a single Black Devil Lily took him about ten days.</p><p>Gui Hou, observing as he removed a complete flower, lent a hand.</p><p>As they were engrossed in their task, they sensed something, stopping their work, exchanging a look.</p><p>“Someone’s coming!” Gui Hou said gravely.</p><p>This magma region, teeming with countless fire beasts and fire spirits, was inherently chaotic.  Their gathering herbs in the Yan Pool didn’t allow them to perceive every external fluctuation.  A mere passerby wouldn't have disturbed them.</p><p>This arrival, however, was unusual.  The person seemed to be fleeing a pursuer, desperately rushing in.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi, possessing considerable composure, refrained from acting rashly, tracing the source of the disturbance to determine the intruder’s direction.</p><p>“Not headed here,” Gui Hou said, his expression easing.</p><p>Before the words left his mouth, they sensed another presence, swiftly approaching.</p><p>Ling Shi murmured, “As expected,” then exclaimed in surprise, “They’re two Nascent Soul cultivators!”</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators were rare in the Fire Domain; encountering two at once, locked in pursuit, was unexpected.</p><p>“Might be from the Three Sects of the Fire Domain, but it's none of our concern; let's focus on our task,” Gui Hou shook his head, but noticed a change in Ling Shi’s expression.</p><p>“That person behind, he's a Corpse Demon from the Fallen Soul Abyss!”</p><p>Ling Shi’s eyes narrowed, a cold smile playing on his lips.  “Those inhuman things, I can smell their corpse stench through the magma!”</p><p>…</p><p>Above.</p><p>A crimson streak of light zipped through the magma.</p><p>Within the escaping light was a burly man.  Qin Sang, had he been present, would have recognized him: Fu Xiao of the Six Harmonies Sect, whom Qin Sang's avatar had lured here after wiping out a band of sand bandits.</p><p>Now, Fu Xiao's massive frame was stooped, his face pale, clearly badly injured.</p><p>A gaping wound, a bloody hole, marred his chest, tearing through his robes.</p><p>The wound almost pierced his back, causing unavoidable internal injuries.</p><p>Worse than the injury itself was the green flame clinging to it.</p><p>This green fire, like a malignant growth, adhered to his flesh, preventing healing and consuming his life force.  Even copious amounts of healing elixirs were useless.</p><p>‘Huff! Huff! Huff!’</p><p>As he fled, Fu Xiao manipulated hand seals, spewing a ball of spiritual fire.</p><p>The spiritual fire clashed with the green flame, yet failed to extinguish it.</p><p>He unleashed several more blasts, only managing to temporarily suppress it.</p><p>Worse, he discovered the green fire was silently encroaching on his internal organs.</p><p>Normally, he had several methods to eliminate the green fire.  But now, gravely wounded and pursued, any solution was beyond his reach.</p><p>He mentally calculated the distance to his sect, growing more anxious. At this rate, he would die before reaching safety.</p><p>He’d accidentally stumbled upon the Corpse Demon's lair, unaware of the hidden ambush.  A single misstep led to an attack, his communication talismans destroyed, leaving him utterly helpless.</p><p>Behind him, the chilling presence relentlessly pursued, rapidly closing the distance.</p><p>His pursuer was a streak of green flame, highly visible in the magma.</p><p>Fu Xiao, cultivating the Six Harmonies Sect's supreme technique, was like a fish in water in the magma, his escape speed lightning-fast.  Yet, this green flame kept pace!</p><p>The green flame enveloped a tall figure, even more imposing than Fu Xiao; one of the individuals Qin Sang had stirred up when he activated the copper pillar.</p><p>The others were nowhere to be seen, leaving this towering man to hunt Fu Xiao alone.</p><p>“Hmph!  Hadn't Lord Fei Luo returned to report, and hadn't Rou Ji been injured, you wouldn't have escaped!  You'll not get away!”</p><p>The tall man roared, his robes billowing, his body suddenly engulfed in green flames, transforming him into a fiery figure.</p><p>Green flames spread, instantly dyeing the surrounding magma green.  The green magma instantly shifted from scorching heat to icy cold.</p><p>The green flames spread with incredible speed.  Fu Xiao had only just realized something was wrong when he was already surrounded by the green magma, a primal instinct warning him of danger.</p><p>Without warning, a bone-white ghostly claw emerged from the green flames. Its five fingers, sharp as blades, clawed towards his back.</p><p>If this attack landed, Fu Xiao would surely be in grave danger.</p><p>Luckily, he was prepared. A fiery red pattern, similar to the Bagua but with subtle differences, appeared on his back, formed from flames.</p><p>As the Bagua fire pattern appeared, a dull thunderclap echoed.</p><p>The ghostly claw struck the fire pattern, causing it to violently shake and crack, but it managed to hold the claw back for a moment.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the opportunity and dashed forward, expecting to distance himself from his pursuer, but he sensed another gust of icy wind.</p><p>The ghostly claw reappeared before him with uncanny speed, aiming for his face.</p><p>Fu Xiao was terrified, but amidst his panic, a ruthless resolve hardened his expression. He opened his mouth, and instead of flames, he spat out a jewel.</p><p>The jewel shone with extraordinary brilliance. It was the Chi Xi Pearl, a treasured item Fu Xiao valued greatly.  Now, to escape, he had no choice but to destroy it.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Chi Xi Pearl shot towards the ghostly claw. The claw instantly sensed the anomaly and retracted its fingers, attempting to flee into the green magma.</p><p>But the claw was too close to Fu Xiao, and Fu Xiao had planned this precisely.  His timing was perfect.</p><p>With a *boom*, the Chi Xi Pearl exploded, a fiery serpent carrying all its fragments, clawing and snapping, burst forth.</p><p>A roar erupted from the magma. The ghostly claw, unable to escape in time, simply remained extended. Its five fingers suddenly spread open, revealing a black eye embedded in its palm, rotating left and right like a living thing – utterly bizarre.</p><p>The eye blinked, and a black ray shot from its pupil towards the fiery serpent born from the Chi Xi Pearl.</p><p>The moment the two forces collided, a figure faintly emerged behind the ghostly claw, recoiling and retreating.</p><p>The Chi Xi Pearl's power was immense, instantly destroying the black ray.</p><p>The tall man appeared rather disheveled, but he had not suffered serious injuries; he had mostly evaded the blast.</p><p>However, the green flames consuming the magma were now fading.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the chance to escape, flicking his sleeve, sending several beams of light flashing towards the enemy. Without looking back to see the result, he chose a direction and fled with all his might.</p><p>He remembered the ruins of a Liuhe Gate site from thousands of years ago.</p><p>The brief battle had severely aggravated Fu Xiao's injuries. He knew that with his own strength alone, escaping was almost impossible.</p><p>He hoped the ruins still existed; it was his only hope!</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi temporarily stopped gathering herbs and quietly left the Yan Pool.</p><p>They hadn't gotten too close to the battlefield, but based on the energy fluctuations, they could accurately deduce what had happened.</p><p>"That's the Dian Cang technique of Liuhe Gate!" Gui Hou didn't often go out, but he was familiar with the forces around, especially the three sects of the Fire Domain.</p><p>"A corpse demon from Luohun Abyss pursuing a Liuhe Gate expert here...don't you find this suspicious?"</p><p>Ling Shi was eager to act.  "Luohun Abyss is extending its influence into the Fire Domain.  There's definitely a grand scheme afoot! We should investigate thoroughly and be prepared, lest we disturb the Daoist place and affect the senior's cultivation!"</p><p>Gui Hou glanced at Ling Shi. He knew Ling Shi had a grudge against Luohun Abyss and undoubtedly wanted to take revenge.</p><p>Ling Shi's words did hold some truth.</p><p>But Gui Hou also considered the possibility that their intervention might unnecessarily provoke the Luohun Abyss ancestor.</p><p>Gui Hou had followed Qin Sang from the Talisman World to the Grand Thousand World. He knew Qin Sang's breakthrough to the Transcendence stage was unconventional. Facing a true Transcendence cultivator, Qin Sang might not necessarily have the advantage. He should focus on consolidating his foundation, delaying confrontation as long as possible.</p><p>"Don't worry, this guy isn't that important in Luohun Abyss.  There are definitely more than just him infiltrating the Fire Domain. The Old Devil has several late-stage Nascent Soul demon heads under him. Losing one corpse demon wouldn't even make him blink," Ling Shi said confidently.</p><p>Just as they were arguing, they heard a voice.</p><p>They immediately stopped, showing respectful expressions.  After listening intently for a moment, they bowed together to the void.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Only after the voice disappeared did they straighten up.</p><p>Ling Shi laughed.  "As expected, the senior already saw through everything!"</p><p>Gui Hou remained noncommittal, looking ahead and hurrying to catch up.  "Daoist friend Ling, we need to discuss a plan.  Master wants him captured alive, so it must be foolproof.  We'll rely on your poison techniques."</p><p>"No problem! Luohun Abyss corpse demons have cultivated corpse poison for years. Ordinary poisons are ineffective against them. But my poison techniques are an exception. I'll ensure they won't return!"</p><p>...</p><p>In the Daoist place.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body sat cross-legged on a stone bed, surrounded by twinkling stars. (End)</p>
