<h1>Chapter 1670  Tian Hao</h1><p>“How have you managed to hold on with a demonic spirit controlling the Five Elements Crown and the Five Elements Divine Ban?”  Zhu Wu Dao questioned again.</p><p>He secretly thought, no wonder the demon child's thoughts were intermittent, blurry, and confused, with slow responses.  It seemed incredibly difficult to transmit thoughts, indicating a perilous situation.</p><p>It turned out he had caused the trouble, battling the Five Elements Crown's demonic spirit.</p><p>Once a spiritual treasure develops a spirit, it undergoes a transformation.</p><p>This is also true for the seal on Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>With a master, the seal can unify the power of the Five Elements Crown and the Five Elements Divine Ban, displaying its strongest suppression ability.  The demonic spirit could then take the opportunity to devour the demon child.</p><p>The demon child, sealed for so long, was already at the end of its rope.</p><p>With the tide turning, the demon child's ability to resist was remarkable, causing Zhu Wu Dao to secretly marvel.</p><p>“The demonic spirit isn't a true spirit; there's incompatibility with its host.  Coupled with my interrupted assimilation, its true nature is incomplete, leading to limitations.  Manipulating the Five Elements Crown is hampered, and this effect is magnified with the Five Elements Divine Ban.  It cannot be perfectly controlled, thus giving me breathing room.”</p><p>The demon child’s response was still intermittent, but understandable.  Zhu Wu Dao was used to this communication style and pieced together the meaning.</p><p>No wonder the demon child called the demonic spirit a freak.</p><p>The demonic spirit’s birth was half from the spiritual treasure's own essence and half from the demon child's demonic nature. It wasn't a pure spirit, yet it possessed sentience.</p><p>This made Zhu Wu Dao increasingly uneasy.  He hadn't expected a spirit to devour its master.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown's essence was tainted…the demon child should be considered a partial master, right?</p><p>The demon child was quite calm about it.  “All things that possess sentience desire transcendence. Unless constantly refined and intimately bonded, who willingly accepts confinement and enslavement?  A spirit devouring its master is nothing strange. Moreover, separated by layers of seals, it was already difficult to taint the spiritual treasure’s essence; I lacked the power to impose further restrictions…”</p><p>“Where is the demonic spirit now?” Zhu Wu Dao was alert, looking around. Recalling the demon child’s previous actions, he had a suspicion.</p><p>“Failing to suppress me, it sought another path.  Born from tainted assimilation, with demonic nature at its core, it acts like us.  Separated from its host, it likely intends to devour several cultivators before returning to devour me, completing its true nature.”</p><p>“So it's been wreaking havoc!”</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao understood.  This explained why Su Zi Nan and the others hadn't caught up.</p><p>He finally grasped the meaning behind the demon child's actions.</p><p>After contacting the demon child, the latter sent a simple thought: break the Jade Pavilion. It didn't dare to say more.</p><p>This was to disrupt the Five Elements Divine Ban.</p><p>Of course, compared to the entire seal, this disruption wasn't enough to free the demon child. He needed to send the statue up the mountain.</p><p>This led to the second objective: let others in to attract the demonic spirit and confuse its judgment, preventing it from becoming alert, allowing Zhu Wu Dao to act freely.</p><p>This approach had advantages and disadvantages. Zhu Wu Dao was moved to the entrance hall and encountered two Daoist masters, leading to a chase.  Fortunately, through skillful maneuvering, he survived.</p><p>Once the demonic spirit was drawn away, the demon child dared to communicate extensively.</p><p>Earlier, Zhu Wu Dao activated the wind array to cover the demonic spirit’s movements. While it was distracted, the demon child transmitted power through the statue, concealing Zhu Wu Dao’s presence and deceiving everyone.</p><p>No wonder the demon child kept urging him, it was incredibly urgent. The demonic spirit was unaware of their connection. Once discovered, if the demonic spirit returned to its host, severing their connection, their efforts would be wasted.</p><p>“Heh… those old fellows are not easy to deal with.”</p><p>Having learned about the demonic spirit’s origin and abilities from the demon child, knowing that the Five Elements Crown was locked in a stalemate with the demon child, and that the demonic spirit only escaped, Zhu Wu Dao chuckled, clearly unconvinced, despite the demonic spirit's ability to somewhat control the Five Elements Divine Ban.</p><p>Those he lured up the mountain were all vicious, cunning, and deeply hidden; several were even beyond his ability to see through.</p><p>The demonic spirit, despite its demonic nature, having been confined to the mountain since its birth, inexperienced in the world, seemed more brutal than cunning—naive even.</p><p>Daring to have ulterior motives against those individuals, it would likely have its teeth knocked out first.</p><p>The demonic spirit only had a chance to devour spirits after weaker cultivators entered the mountain.  Luckily, the Yunlong collapsed outside the mountain, blocking others and preventing them from arriving.  Otherwise, today's situation would have been far worse.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao pondered, then a sudden worry struck him. "Aren't you afraid the spirit will willingly submit to a master?" he asked anxiously.</p><p>The spirit's state was unique; there was an incompatibility between it and its original form.  However, having a master would make a huge difference.  As long as the spirit cooperated, even using the simplest Soul Binding Technique, the master could unify the spirit and the Five Elements Crown, concealing the flaws and unleashing the Crown's full power.</p><p>With the master's help, gradually and systematically, the spirit could eventually achieve harmony with the Crown, overcome the molding barrier, and become a true spirit weapon.</p><p>The difficulty in creating a spirit weapon lies in the process of going from nothing to something.</p><p>From a magic item developing sentience to that sentience nurturing a spirit, each step is incredibly difficult; nine out of ten magic items and spiritual treasures fail at this stage.</p><p>Countless Ascension cultivators have reached the Divine Transformation stage in Central Plains over the ages, yet even with their closest, most cherished items, no one has ever heard of a true spirit weapon being born.</p><p>Mozi let out a derisive laugh. "I already told you this, have you forgotten? The spirit was born from the Five Elements Crown's inherent spirit. As a spiritual treasure, it's had countless masters and has been controlled and manipulated countless times using the Soul Binding Technique.  That imprint is deeply ingrained in its mind, impossible to erase, making it incapable of submitting to a new master!"</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao lacked understanding of a spirit's thoughts and feelings, making it hard to empathize. However, Mozi’s tone was so confident that he believed it was true.</p><p>He wanted to ask more questions, but the statue kept sending impatient thoughts, urging him to hurry.</p><p>Sensing Mozi's growing irritability and simmering rage, Zhu Wu Dao wisely shut his mouth, refraining from further questions.</p><p>On Di Shou Mountain, others remained unaware. A shadow, perfectly concealed within a windstorm, was rapidly approaching the summit.</p><p>Even the raging windstorm couldn't completely obscure the wondrous sights on Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>With every few steps Zhu Wu Dao took, he encountered a completely different scene.  It was truly a celestial paradise. If the situation weren't so urgent, he would have loved to take his time and appreciate it.</p><p>After traveling a considerable distance, he suddenly saw clouds gathering like a canopy ahead.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao stopped.  As far as he knew, the Wordless Jade Tablet was located there!</p><p>Beneath the clouds lay a valley, not very deep, sealed off by a cloud-like barrier. He could sense a surge of spiritual energy within, a place of exceptional spiritual abundance.</p><p>The spiritual energy here was almost tangible. It was difficult to say whether the clouds were a barrier, a manifestation of the spiritual energy, or both.</p><p>A faint, soft glow emanated from the depths of the valley. There, against a cliff face, stood a nearly square, ten-meter-high jade-like slab, bearing no inscriptions—the Wordless Jade Tablet.</p><p>Its surface was clear and reflective, like rippling water, mirroring the valley's beauty.</p><p>Several meditation cushions, woven from calming herbs, sat before the tablet. Neglected for a long time, they had lost their luster, adding to the feeling of desolation.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao took a long look at the valley but didn't linger.</p><p>Past the Wordless Jade Tablet lay the summit.</p><p>Following Mozi's instructions, Zhu Wu Dao bypassed a grand hall and reached the summit. Looking down, he discovered that Di Shou Mountain's interior was hollow.</p><p>The light inside was dim, with a hazy aura lingering, and other colored lights faintly glimmering in the distance.</p><p>Without hesitation, he leaped into the hollow mountain, landing in the hazy air.  He felt a sense of oppression and instinctively adjusted his posture.</p><p>Not far down, the lights became clearer.</p><p>They were five-colored, similar to the clouds outside.</p><p>A thought struck Zhu Wu Dao: the converging power of the Five Elements Divine Restriction.  The Five Elements Crown must be stored here, serving as the central seal, controlling the restriction.</p><p>Correspondingly, Mozi was also imprisoned here.</p><p>As expected, Zhu Wu Dao soon saw a mass of five-colored clouds—a dome of multicolored light—too dense to see through.</p><p>This was the manifestation of the sealing power.  It was mainly focused on the interior, preventing Mozi's escape.  The Wu Xiang Sect's ancestors must have believed the Demon Calamity was over, and with the seal located within Di Shou Mountain, their core territory, they didn’t expect any trouble, so they didn't implement extensive measures.</p><p>Within the dome, multicolored light flowed incessantly, incredibly strong.  Before Zhu Wu Dao could even steady himself, he felt the statue's thoughts: "Set up the formation here."</p><p>Mozi's thoughts were tinged with fatigue, but mostly excitement.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao nodded slightly, surveyed the area, flew to the side of a cave, found a protruding rock, landed on it, and sat cross-legged.</p><p>He wasn't in a hurry to take out the statue.</p><p>A flurry of hand seals produced a series of runes that landed on the cloud-like formations.  These runes interconnected, forming an obscure, dark curtain seemingly probing for weaknesses in the seal, but actually preparing for the next stage.</p><p>The statue, originally intended to rescue the Saint Emperor, was now being grossly underutilized.  It served as a conduit, both internally and externally, and a vessel for the demonic child.  Through this connection, they wouldn’t need to forcibly break the seal.  A blood sacrifice would subtly widen the passage, allowing the demonic child's spirit to transfer and inhabit the statue, subsequently escaping.</p><p>If manipulated correctly, this could evade the demonic spirit’s perception, proceeding undetected.  Even if the demonic spirit returned during the ritual, it would be difficult to stop them.</p><p>Simultaneously, Zhu Wu Dao channeled a spark of spiritual light from within the statue, transmitting a signal.</p><p>Outside the Wuxiang Immortal Gate.</p><p>Southern Barbarian Provinces.</p><p>The high priests participating in the blood sacrifice had grown impatient.  The statue linked the inner and outer realms; once Zhu Wu Dao began, they could sense it through the statue and perform the final ritual.</p><p>The Imperial Envoy had given a rough timeframe before departure, but the agreed-upon time had long passed, and there was still no sign.</p><p>The blood sacrifice had created a considerable disturbance. Although limited to commoners and low-level cultivators, the wide scope across the two provinces, and the large number of deaths with their bizarre circumstances, would undoubtedly raise suspicion.</p><p>If not for the emergence of the Wuxiang Immortal Gate and the legacy temple captivating the attention of the Southern Barbarian cultivators, various factions would have already discovered the scheme and launched an investigation.</p><p>Even so, most of the deceptive measures had already been uncovered, and exposure was imminent.</p><p>Just as despair set in, the signal finally arrived.  Overjoyed, they prostrated themselves, shouting praises for the Saint Emperor, their faces filled with fervent excitement.  Of course, they hadn't forgotten their duties.</p><p>The statue was in place!</p><p>Unseen, the blood sacrifice array laid out by the Qu Yang Mountain lineage across the Southern Barbarian Provinces for generations was finally complete!</p><p>Even across thousands of miles, the blood-soaked statues seemed to respond simultaneously to a summons, their eerie red eyes opening.  A strange aura flowed with their gaze, converging on the statue held by the high priest, then transmitting to Mount Taiyue.</p><p>Within his sleeve, the statue glowed crimson, intensely hot, its heat more alarming than before, accompanied by an unnatural wave that assaulted Zhu Wu Dao's mind.</p><p>He struggled to suppress the statue's fluctuations to avoid detection by the demonic spirit, his movements growing faster.</p><p>The formation was nearing completion.</p><p>Sensing something, Zhu Wu Dao frowned, suddenly looking up to see a hazy atmosphere beneath a bright moon.</p><p>It wasn't a moon, but an ancient mirror. If Qin Sang were present, they would recognize the mirror's resemblance to the Tianhao Tower’s treasure ship.</p><p>“The Tianhao Mirror!”</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao’s face paled. “You dare bring this treasure out of the sect!”</p><p>Only one person could control the Tianhao Mirror on Mount Di: Fan Laomo!</p><p>The Tianhao Mirror was the Tianhao Tower's most treasured artifact, the cornerstone of their fortune, left by their founding ancestor.  It had always resided at the heart of the sect's protective array since the sect’s founding.</p><p>The upper echelons of the sect were aware that no one could, or dared, remove it.  Even the Qu Yang Mountain’s long-term scheme had never targeted the Tianhao Mirror.</p><p>Fan Laomo had gone mad, stealing the Tianhao Mirror.  Even if he had, the sect leader wouldn’t have followed suit.</p><p>“A mere mirror charm!  The sect spent years and countless resources to create it, with abysmal success rates. To think its first use is against fellow sect members.  Still, even if this charm is precious, how could we know of Brother Zhu’s schemes without it?”</p><p>After Zhu Wu Dao's disappearance, Fan Laomo didn't move far.  He sat cross-legged, his hands resting on his knees, a white light hovering before him.  Within the light, the shape of the ancient mirror was visible, though it appeared ethereal, not solid.</p><p>Fan Laomo spoke without sound, his voice transmitted through the mirror into the cave.</p><p>Before Zhu Wu Dao could respond…</p><p>The mirror slightly tilted, shining on the five-colored seal.</p><p>“This is where the First Spiritual Treasure is kept?  You think I don’t know the secret of the Wordless Jade Bi? You planned to use a useless treasure to make me risk my life for you?”</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao could only be grateful he hadn’t yet revealed the statue. Fan Laomo believed he was after the treasure.</p><p>Quickly composing himself, Zhu Wu Dao pressed down on his sleeve, feigning composure, and said in a low voice, “Even if Senior Brother seizes the treasure, without the Treasure Control Scripture, how can you control it?  Let me explain…”</p><p>He was interrupted by Fan Laomo’s exclamation, who calmly said, “What need for the Treasure Control Scripture? Just by observing the arrangement of the Five Elements Divine Restriction, it's clear this treasure is related to the Five Elements. The method of control can be found in the outer Five Elements restrictions. No wonder the classics record that whenever the Wuxiang Immortal Gate used this treasure, there would always be a grand formation, a huge spectacle!”</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao’s expression changed, wanting to defend himself.</p><p>Fan Laomo let out a soft gasp, and the ancient mirror suddenly vanished.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The grey mist churned, and a rainbow bridge descended into the mountain's depths!</p>
