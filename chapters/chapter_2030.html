<h1>Chapter 2021: City Crack</h1><p>As Qin Sang moved forward, a powerful suction force tore at him, pulling him towards the void.  Approaching the edge of the black disc, he didn't stop but entered it.  The suction intensified, accompanied by a rotational force.  He activated his blood energy, relying on his strong physique to forcibly remain stationary. He felt as if he were trapped inside a giant millstone, constantly being ground.</p><p>After experiencing this for a while, Qin Sang retreated. He took some spiritual materials from his storage ring and quickly refined two puppets, launching them towards the black disc.</p><p>The puppets were instantly caught by the suction force, rapidly spinning along the disc's surface. Their speed increased exponentially until they were sucked into the void in a blink.</p><p>Because of their weak strength, the puppets offered no resistance to the suction and weren't crushed by the disc.  They remained intact until swallowed by the void, suffering virtually no damage.</p><p>This observation didn't allow Qin Sang to determine if the void was safe.  He saw the puppets vanish upon contact with the void and immediately lost contact with them, unable to know what happened beyond.</p><p>This test, however, gave Qin Sang some clues.  He pondered how he could utilize this and explore the void's interior.</p><p>Sending anyone or anything into the void meant accepting the possibility of no return. One also needed a way to breach the void's barrier and send out a message; otherwise, any attempt would be futile.</p><p>Qin Sang considered his options.  Apart from risking a closer approach and awakening the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to try and use its divine ability to investigate, he seemed to have no other good solution.</p><p>Instead of immediately awakening the butterfly, Qin Sang decided to try other methods.  He manifested his phantom body, repeatedly entering the black disc to feel the suction force's power, constantly pushing his limits, and employing various secret techniques to probe it.</p><p>As Qin Sang continued his efforts, a gentle breeze suddenly brushed his face.</p><p>The breeze was incredibly soft, like a warm spring wind – something most people wouldn't notice.  But here, it felt strange and unsettling.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He abruptly looked towards the depths of the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>Zhuque and the other demon lords, belatedly realizing something was wrong, remembered the legends of the Fengju Jade Gate and cried out, "It's the Evil Wind!"</p><p>The two great calamities, the Evil Wind and the Ghostly Thunder, were encountered by Qin Sang for the first time since entering the Fengju Jade Gate.  These calamities sometimes appeared separately, sometimes together, without any discernible pattern.  As the cry rang out, the Evil Wind's intensity increased at an alarming rate.</p><p>Although the area was tightly enclosed by divine powers and illusions, the Evil Wind seemed to penetrate everything, constantly blowing, whistling in their ears.</p><p>The Evil Wind's power was said to fluctuate; at its weakest, its lethality was limited.  But their current location was exceptionally precarious – amidst the divine illusions. If the Evil Wind triggered the dormant power within these illusions, everyone would be terrified, especially with the terrifying black hole nearby.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze hardened. Without hesitation, he grabbed Zhuque and the other demons, bringing them before him.  He then flew outward with his true body, leaving his phantom body behind.</p><p>This was a risky maneuver, but it offered a rare chance to observe the void using the Evil Wind.</p><p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p><p>By the time Qin Sang had escaped the area of divine illusions, the Evil Wind's power had reached a terrifying level.</p><p>Invisible wind gushed forth endlessly from the depths of the Fengju Jade Gate, leaving visible scars in the void like bone-chilling steel blades cutting through space.</p><p>Looking around, the Evil Wind was everywhere, unhindered even by the divine illusions.  Even Qin Sang, with his robust physique, felt a chilling coldness as the wind swept past.</p><p>Zhuque, riding the Fire Jade Centipede, with flames rising around her, remained relatively alright. Gui Hou and Luo Hou leaned together, resisting the Evil Wind.</p><p>"Click! Click! Click…"</p><p>The captured cultivator, with his cultivation sealed, began to tremble, his face turning pale, his body quickly covered in frost.  Zhuque intervened, shielding him, before his condition worsened.</p><p>At this moment, cultivators elsewhere were also suffering from the Evil Wind's assault. Chaos reigned within the Fengju Jade Gate, and some perished without knowing what hit them.</p><p>Qin Sang monitored the void through his phantom body. As the Evil Wind intensified, the black disc became unstable.  Waves rose on its surface, occasionally erupting with black jets.</p><p>Sensing the power of the jets, Qin Sang's phantom body's expression turned grave. He retreated again and again. Finally, his phantom body's expression changed completely.  It transformed into a streak of lightning, frantically retreating.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang witnessed a shocking scene. A massive, dark tide surged forward, overwhelming the closest divine power illusions to the black disc.</p><p>Qin Sang watched helplessly as these illusions, seemingly compressed by an external force, deformed, then stretched into thin, luminous ribbons before being sucked into the void, disappearing completely.</p><p>These illusions were manifestations of ancient power, almost indistinguishable from reality. Qin Sang had seen illusions destroyed before, but never one consumed so effortlessly, without resistance.</p><p>With the dark tide's eruption, the area became extremely dangerous.  Qin Sang's spirit body, unfazed, fixated on the void.</p><p>When the illusions were swallowed, the expected conflict and explosion failed to materialize. The illusions simply vanished.  Given their immense power, their silent demise was unsettling.</p><p>"Could the void truly lead to another place?"</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit body left, reaching the edge of the illusion cluster, where he found a lone, slowly drifting illusion.</p><p>"Was it drawn in by the void?"</p><p>Qin Sang began to understand. The black disc's eruption caused the void to consume surrounding illusions, while simultaneously drawing in replacements, maintaining a constant shroud of illusions.</p><p>"What a gluttonous thing!"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, acknowledging the abundance of extraordinary phenomena in Fengju Yumen and Jushan Zhizhitan.</p><p>After merging his spirit body with his main body and waiting for the strange winds to subside, Qin Sang returned to find the black disc back to normal.</p><p>Unable to fathom the void's nature, even with the illusions as probes, he decided against further investigation.  He memorized the location and left with Zhuque and the other demon beasts.</p><p>The strange winds had caused minimal damage.  Qin Sang resumed his travels.</p><p>…</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, seven years had passed since they entered Fengju Yumen.</p><p>Tianyue Shangren had yet to appear.</p><p>Qin Sang diligently sought escape routes, identifying potential locations and pathways.  Coupled with the mysterious void, he had three options. But he felt it wasn't enough.  These routes might suffice against Nascent Soul cultivators, but against those at the Unity or Mahayana stages, their effectiveness was unknown.</p><p>He never stopped.  After Guya's full recovery, she assisted Zhuque. Su Nu remained in seclusion, recovering from her injuries, while the Xin family's search remained fruitless.</p><p>Interestingly, his request for the Xin family to locate the Dihua Yugui vine yielded a few promising leads, although Qin Sang didn't prioritize it.</p><p>One day, it was time for their scheduled meeting.</p><p>Qin Sang met with the Xin family, unsurprisingly finding no progress.  Their secretive search baffled him.</p><p>As they debated changing strategies, a streak of light approached, seemingly originating from outside Fengju Yumen.</p><p>The light landed before the carriage, revealing a young-looking cultivator at the Transformation stage.</p><p>"Xin Ming, what brings you here?  Has something significant happened outside?"  Luo, the steward, asked.</p><p>The Xin family hadn't brought all their personnel into Fengju Yumen, leaving some behind.</p><p>Xin Ming bowed hastily, using silencing magic, and urgently reported: "Reporting to the young master and Steward Luo, Yumen Pass is in trouble!"</p><p>Luo's heart skipped a beat. Xin Ming's magic couldn't mask his voice from Qin Sang and Pei Gongfeng, who immediately turned their attention.</p><p>Yumen Pass, standing for years, what trouble could it possibly face? Could someone dare attack the city?</p><p>"Recently, powerful cultivators clashed near Yumen Pass, alarming the entire city. The impact of their abilities shook the heavens and earth, creating a devastating storm…"</p><p>Recalling the scene, Xin Ming's eyes widened, swallowing hard.  "Yumen Pass activated its protective formation, yet it still shook violently under the impact, threatening to collapse. Then, a deafening crack appeared in the west wall, nearly causing it to crumble…"</p><p>Qin Sang and Pei Gongfeng paled at Xin Ming's description.</p><p>Yumen Pass, standing at the entrance of Fengju Yumen for years, was the west gate of Duizhou. The strength of its protective formation was unquestionable.</p><p>Qin Sang, upon entering the city, witnessed only a fraction of the formation's power, yet it was enough to dissuade him from any attempt to force his way through.  The mere aftershocks of the battle, felt even beyond the formation, nearly destroyed the city walls. Were the combatants at the Unity or Transcendence stage? The sudden appearance of two powerful cultivators near Fengju Yumen—what did it mean?  Was it coincidence, or an unforeseen event?</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, feeling uneasy. Could one of them be Tian Yue Shangren, entangled with an adversary?</p><p>"Who were they fighting?"  Pei Gongfeng asked, voicing Qin Sang's unspoken question.</p><p>"Unclear," Xin Ming shook his head. "Throughout the entire battle, neither cultivator revealed themselves.  City dwellers only saw raging storms and dazzling lights in the sky.  Eventually, the two cultivators left, leaving no one to know the victor."</p><p>Left...could they be heading towards Fengju Yumen?</p><p>Qin Sang and Pei Gongfeng exchanged a look.</p><p>"What's the situation at Yumen Pass now?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>"Following the battle, rumors are rampant.  People say a great war is imminent. The city is in a panic, fearing collateral damage. Many are fleeing the city, heading into the heartland of Duizhou.  It's said that a similar panic occurred when the Jiange fragments were first discovered, but this time, the impact from the powerful cultivators' battle is far greater, affecting almost the entire city. Outsiders, independent cultivators, established sects, major trading houses—everyone is evacuating. It's utter chaos..."</p><p>Xin Ming's words deepened their apprehension. They were inside Fengju Yumen, closer to the epicenter of the storm than Yumen Pass.</p><p>"Did the Five Elements League leave as well?" Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>"That..."</p><p>Xin Ming hesitated. He knew Qin Sang was an elder of the Five Elements League, a helper invited by the young master.</p><p>"Spit it out! Speak plainly!" the young master Xin rebuked, speaking for the first time. His tone was even.</p><p>"Passing by the Five Elements League's gate, I saw they'd closed their doors, but I don't know if they've evacuated. Yumen Pass is almost deserted. Many sects with deep roots there have sealed their gates and fled. The city is incredibly chaotic," Xin Ming quickly replied.</p><p>Qin Sang thought, *It seems the Five Elements League has withdrawn.  They're merchants; avoiding danger is instinct.  With their size, they wouldn't risk it.*</p><p>The Five Elements League was secondary. The key was the two mysterious cultivators—their purpose, their current whereabouts.</p><p>Even before Tian Yue Shangren's arrival, turmoil erupted.</p><p>Xin Ming's report was earth-shattering.  Luo Guanshi was worried. "Young master, I fear Fengju Yumen is unsafe. Should we leave and lay low...?"</p><p>The young master Xin fell silent for a moment, then simply said, "There's no turning back."</p><p>Luo Guanshi sighed.</p><p>"Let's observe for a while longer," the young master said. "But we can't remain so dispersed. We'll consolidate into three groups..."</p><p>While master and servant conferred, Pei Gongfeng's expression shifted, seemingly weighing something.</p><p>"This news is too shocking. I'll be going ahead," Qin Sang bowed, preparing to leave.</p><p>Noticing the young master's gaze, Qin Sang added, "Young master Xin, rest assured. Your family has helped me search for so long—you deserve credit even if you haven't succeeded. Unless absolutely necessary, I won't break my word."</p><p>"Thank you, Elder Qin."</p><p>The young master Xin rose and bowed formally.</p><p>Pei Gongfeng narrowed his eyes, watching Qin Sang's retreating figure without a word.</p><p>After bidding farewell to the Xin family, Qin Sang considered his next move.  He'd need to recall Zhuque and the others to his side, to prevent any accidents.</p><p>And Su Nu—how were her injuries? This wasn't a good place for recuperation.</p><p>Qin Sang soon found Zhuque and the others.  Considering he didn't want Gu Ya and Su Nu to meet, he went to Su Nu's cave alone.</p><p>Su Nu's complexion was rosier, though still faintly pale—not fully recovered.</p><p>"Thank you for the warning, Brother Qin.  I need to leave. I'll reconsider further actions after my strength has returned. Aren't you coming with me to avoid this?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I still have matters to attend to.  I'll find you as soon as things look bad."</p><p>Su Nu didn't press further, simply saying, "Be careful, Brother Qin!"</p><p>They agreed on a meeting place, and Qin Sang took his leave.</p><p>As Qin Sang's escaping light vanished, a man emerged from behind Su Nu.</p><p>His figure was elusive, shrouded in a hazy, ethereal aura, giving off an air of mystery. He gazed at the direction Qin Sang had gone, seeming to see his back through space. After a moment of silence, he said, "From now on, you stay by his side."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Su Nu bowed in obedience.</p>
