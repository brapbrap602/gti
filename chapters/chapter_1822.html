<h1>Chapter 1813: Poison Origin</h1><p>Entering this place, Qin Sang encountered various strange phenomena.</p><p>The White Jade Elder appeared to be just an ordinary statue.</p><p>Yet, black skeletons knelt before it in prostration, demonstrating their devoutness.</p><p>For black skeletons to be here, their cultivation before death must have been considerable.</p><p>A cultivator of such high cultivation showing such devotion suggests either control by others or the presence of a deity.</p><p>Qin Sang remained alert, silently observing the cave, and discovered a pouch beneath the black skeletons.</p><p>The pouch was brightly colored, certainly a treasure.</p><p>Besides that, no other artifacts or jade slips were found. The pouch was likely a spatial storage device.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang noticed the skeletons' unnatural posture – twisted and broken in several places, indicating severe injuries before death.</p><p>He immediately recalled the broken bones outside the stone door. This skeleton was intact, so the broken bones must have belonged to someone else. A fight had taken place here.</p><p>"Internal conflict or external enemy?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>The restriction on the hidden door blocked the flower spirit's perception, but it was unclear whether it could withstand evil spirits.</p><p>They may have been attacked by evil spirits or killed each other.</p><p>The skeletons showed they had been dead for a long time. The cave was full of bones, yielding no further clues.</p><p>However, these discoveries made Qin Sang vigilant. The White Jade Elder, the unidentified evil spirits, and the possibility of a nest of evil spirits – everything seemed unusual.</p><p>"There are Celestial Gods of Daoism, there are demon gods, and naturally, there are evil gods…"</p><p>Qin Sang took a final look at the White Jade Elder, pondered for a moment, and slowly retreated.</p><p>Back at the stone door, he sat cross-legged.</p><p>He did not enter the cave or use his spiritual sense to investigate the White Jade Elder, nor did he take the pouch. Qin Sang feared that reckless actions would invite trouble, leaving him vulnerable.</p><p>His condition was poor, and he urgently needed to address the accumulated toxins in his body. Since there was no immediate danger, he should treat his injuries and recover his strength as soon as possible.</p><p>The mountain's interior was peaceful, a world apart from the outside.</p><p>During this time, the stone door remained stable, confirming that the flower spirit would not force its way in.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to remain vigilant, primarily against the statue inside, not the flower spirit outside.</p><p>He calmed down, activated the poison pearl, and refined the toxins in his body.</p><p>After careful analysis, Qin Sang found a connection between the various potent poisons: the poison in the poisonous water, the poisonous restriction on the seventh archway of the palace, the evil spirit's poison, and even the hidden door's restriction – all were intricately linked to the poison of the flower field.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the hidden door used the flower poison to create the restriction, blocking the flower spirit’s perception.</p><p>This showed that the bone flower field was the foundation of this poisonous domain.</p><p>The flower poison in the field contained the flower spirit's resentment, making it more potent.  Improper handling, allowing the resentful poison to invade the mind, would be a significant problem.</p><p>Qin Sang was not afraid of this, treating it as a normal potent poison.  With the situation unclear, and to recover quickly, he did not attempt to have the poison pearl absorb it, instead using the Detoxifying Radiance to expel it.</p><p>Soon, faint black gas emanated from Qin Sang's skin, followed by various colors flashing. Strands of poison were expelled.</p><p>This poison drifted toward Qin Sang's chest, where a layer of Detoxifying Radiance confined it, preventing it from dissipating.</p><p>Gradually, less poison was expelled, and Qin Sang's complexion returned to normal. He let out a long breath, awakening refreshed.</p><p>His eyes shone brightly, fully restored!</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the poison before him, closed his hand, and the poison contracted into a pearl, but its color was mottled, far less pure than the round pearl from the evil spirit's body.</p><p>He casually put it into his storage ring, glanced at the hidden door, and walked towards the interior of the cave.</p><p>The White Jade Elder remained unchanged, standing on the altar.</p><p>With renewed confidence, Qin Sang boldly examined the White Jade Elder, his gaze finally settling on the pouch. He made a gesture, and the pouch flew into his hand.</p><p>As expected, it was a spatial storage device.</p><p>The previous owner had not placed any special restrictions on the pouch, saving Qin Sang some effort.</p><p>Opening the pouch, he saw its contents.</p><p>After careful examination, Qin Sang gradually frowned.</p><p>The pouch contained mostly trivial items, different from his expectations. He found nothing to prove the black skeleton's identity, no jade slips, and no way to determine his origin through cultivation techniques or secret arts.</p><p>It could only be determined that this person was extremely skilled in the art of poison.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were no records related to the flower field, so he still had to find a way out on his own.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the White Jade Elder, pondered for a moment, and decided to go out for a while.</p><p>The urgency of his departure stemmed from two objectives: a thorough exploration of this space, and the search for Qing Dan Yuan Jun and Bo Xian Shan Ren.</p><p>If these two cultivators were also trapped in the flower fields and unable to escape, they must be nearing their limits.  Their repeated investigations of this place undoubtedly yielded knowledge of hidden secrets, potentially revealing the origin of the flower fields and a way out.</p><p>Qin Sang, always planning his retreat first, had devised an escape strategy before investigating Bai Yu Lao Ren. This precaution allowed for a swift escape should things turn dangerous.</p><p>His caution stemmed from another concern.  Qin Sang's analysis of the flower poison failed to link it to the strange poison that killed several disciples at Lou Gu Mountain, indicating a hidden danger.</p><p>He quickly returned to the stone door, his palm touching its surface.  The Tian Mu Butterfly, during the detoxification process, had already meticulously memorized the structure of the door's enchantment.  </p><p>With a flash of light, Qin Sang reappeared outside the stone door.</p><p>The previously calm flower fields instantly erupted, flower spirits and clouds of resentment surging forth in a frenzied pursuit of Qin Sang.</p><p>Ascending to high ground, he surveyed his surroundings.  No unusual phenomena were visible among the peaks and ridges.  Qin Sang then used his thunder escape technique to swiftly traverse the mountains, heading back towards the deepest part of the flower fields.</p><p>The deepest areas contained two flower fields, each corresponding to a main hall.  Having previously fallen into the left field, Qin Sang now aimed for the other.</p><p>Employing swordsmanship and thunder techniques, he carved a path through.  </p><p>Stunningly beautiful flowers and countless white skeletons met his gaze. The bones in this flower field were exceptionally white and of high quality.</p><p>Countless flower spirits charged, but no evil spirits were present, nor any sign of the two cultivators.</p><p>He wondered if the flower spirits consumed flesh. If the two cultivators perished here, they might have already turned to bone.</p><p>His divine sense swept across the entire flower field, yet no trace of the cultivators' belongings remained.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's gaze fixed on the area behind the flower field.  According to the palace layout, there should be no flower fields there, only mountains.</p><p>However, Qin Sang detected something unusual.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The Five Thunder Heaven Heart Seal reappeared, eliminating flower spirits.  Qin Sang flew to a higher vantage point for a clearer view.</p><p>Behind the two flower fields, several mountain peaks were noticeably darker than their surroundings, shrouded in a gray haze, casting eerie shadows.</p><p>Even a brief glance sent a shiver down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>At his level of cultivation, his spiritual senses were exceptionally acute, making illusions nearly impossible.  Only one conclusion remained:  the area was extremely dangerous!</p><p>Without considering a personal investigation, Qin Sang decisively retreated from the flower field, speeding outward, flying past numerous flower fields until reaching the location of a palace gate.</p><p>The results were disappointing. Qin Sang found neither an exit nor the two cultivators.</p><p>He continued his escape. The vastness of this space exceeded his expectations, yet he eventually reached the edge of the mountain range.</p><p>The edge of the space, like the sky, was sealed by a distorting force.</p><p>His search fruitless, and burdened by accumulated flower poison, Qin Sang returned to the cave.</p><p>With the loss of their target, the flower spirits dispersed, returning to their cocoons to sleep.</p><p>The area gradually returned to normalcy, yet an unsettling stillness lingered, permeating the entire space.</p><p>Even before Qin Sang's intrusion, this stillness had persisted for countless years, untouched even by the dancing flower spirits.</p><p>Gently touching the stone door, Qin Sang fell into contemplation.</p><p>Then, he rapidly tapped the stone door, imbuing it with seals that integrated with the poison enchantment, bringing it under his control.</p><p>This didn't diminish the enchantment's power but allowed Qin Sang to manipulate it with greater ease and to observe the outside world through it.</p><p>The Tian Mu Butterfly emerged from his energy sea, circled him once, and then merged into the enchantment, taking in the entire sky.</p><p>Qin Sang once again sat cross-legged behind the stone door, his mind connected to the butterfly, detoxifying himself while observing the force that sealed the space.</p><p>After a while, he finally noticed something.</p><p>Tian Mu's divine ability locked onto a specific point in the sky. Qin Sang's brows furrowed in concentration, seemingly deeply engrossed in deduction.</p><p>Gradually, his expression relaxed.</p><p>As expected, beyond that location should lie a cluster of mist, one of the passages out of this space!</p><p>Knowing how to leave, Qin Sang's expression softened, yet he kept the butterfly vigilant, entering the cave a third time.</p><p>This time without hesitation, Qin Sang sent a strand of divine sense towards Bai Yu Lao Ren.</p><p>After a moment, a look of surprise crossed his face.</p><p>His divine sense, upon entering the Bai Yu, revealed it wasn't a statue, but something extraordinary—like a jade slip, containing a scripture!</p><p>Breaking the seal, Qin Sang's mind was flooded with profound scriptures titled "The Poison God Scripture"!</p><p>The name suggested a sacred text of the poison dao.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He examined the text carefully, and gasped halfway through.  Shock filled his eyes as he muttered, "The flower field… it was artificially created, a fertile field used to cultivate poison!  Bones are the fertilizer, the dew of poisonous flowers…"</p><p>Just then, Tianmu Butterfly transmitted a thought. Qin Sang collected his thoughts and, through the butterfly, ‘saw’ the scene outside the mountain.</p><p>In a certain part of the sky, a distortion of power caused an unusual fluctuation, forming a vortex high in the air.</p><p>This was an external force.</p><p>The vortex twisted, struggling to take shape.  It was clear the force was attempting to break through the celestial dome, but it couldn't penetrate the distortion, managing only to maintain the vortex.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately understood. Outside, it was likely the two Masters attempting to rescue him.</p><p>They had escaped.</p><p>Indeed, Qing Dan Yuanjun had repeatedly investigated the Poison Domain.  While she didn't understand its true nature, she'd discovered some clues and secrets, only fully comprehending the situation during the palace's transformation.</p><p>Although they had escaped danger, they were seriously injured, forcefully suppressing the potent poison within them. After hastily recovering some strength, they found a swirling mist and came to rescue Qin Sang.</p><p>As long as Qin Sang was alive, and saw this celestial sign, a coordinated effort inside and out might offer a chance of escape.</p><p>"Worthy allies,"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.</p><p>This world's Daoist sect, faced external threats from demons, maintained internal order.  Beasts and monsters were countless, unlike the Storm World's scarcity of cultivation resources.  The Daoist cultivators he had encountered were mostly refined and righteous.</p><p>There was even a prevailing doctrine within the Daoist sect: if one cultivates to prolong life, one must first accumulate merit and virtue. Merit without virtue leads to an unattainable Dao fruit.  Both merit and virtue are necessary to become a true Master.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't respond to the two Masters.  This "Poison God Canon" had opened his eyes, and he was unwilling to leave just yet.</p><p>"Since they're safe, there's no need to meet them immediately. I can think of an excuse later…"</p><p>The spatial array in this area was recorded in the "Poison God Canon." Those unfamiliar with arrays could only enter and exit the flower field through the single entrance – the spirit tree in the palace.</p><p>The palace was a facade, a deception.</p><p>The palace originally had a restriction concealing the spirit tree.  Perhaps due to the passage of time, and its location within the constantly shifting altar, the array had been damaged, causing the spirit tree to appear, even allowing parts of the flower field to manifest in reality, forming the swirling mist.</p><p>Unaware of the situation, the three had pulled up the spirit tree, destroying the entrance, resulting in the palace's collapse and the appearance of a terrifying scene of spatial distortion that grew increasingly severe.</p><p>Even using the mist, exiting was easy, but entering was difficult.</p><p>The vortex in the sky lingered for a while before finally dissipating.  Receiving no response, the two Masters assumed Qin Sang was dead and could only leave the Poison Domain to resolve their internal poisons.</p><p>Qin Sang was now wholeheartedly studying the "Poison God Canon."</p><p>Initially, he was merely shocked by the origin of the bone flower field.</p><p>After reading the entire "Poison God Canon," he was stunned by its profound techniques.</p><p>Undeniably, it was a sacred text of poison cultivation, a superior lineage, likely not originating from the Daoist sect, as the "Poison God Canon" made no mention of any Daoist techniques.</p><p>It was impossible to determine the cultivation method practiced by the black skeleton.</p><p>The Daoist sect surely wouldn't have such an aberrant method of creating a field of corpses to cultivate poison.</p><p>It could be confirmed that the black skeleton had practiced the "Poison God Canon."</p><p>Qin Sang took out two jade slips, the poison-tempering secret arts obtained from Qing Dan Yuanjun.</p><p>This secret art originated from the "Poison God Canon," but was only a part of the lineage, not the core. It was a special technique used to aid cultivation.</p><p>The "Poison God Canon" was far more extreme. Its core technique was to introduce poison into the body, refine it into essence, and cultivate poison essence for rapid advancement.</p><p>The bone flower field was a medicinal field. The flower spirits were not spiritual beings, but a rare type of poisonous flower, whose dew was a superior poison, ideal for cultivating poison essence.</p><p>Cultivating with potent poisons was extremely dangerous.</p><p>During cultivation, residual poison inevitably accumulated in the body.  With accumulating poison, if it could not be suppressed, death from poisoning was inevitable.</p><p>This led to the poison-tempering technique—using residual poison to temper the body.  This served both to purge the poison and strengthen the body, increasing resistance to poison, achieving a unique form of dual cultivation of body and technique.</p><p>However, this was merely a temporary fix, not a true solution to the problem. While cultivation improved, the root of the poison remained.  Once cultivation began, it could not stop, otherwise the poison would immediately erupt.</p><p>Only by breaking through to a higher realm of cultivation or body refinement before the poison broke out was there a chance of survival.</p><p>This method was a race against the poison within.</p><p>Used correctly, it was a miraculous technique, otherwise it was a path to self-destruction, as the black skeleton vividly demonstrated!</p>
