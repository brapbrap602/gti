**Chapter 292: Pathseekers**

While flying over the abyss, Qin Sang took a deep look at the battlefield.

When he crushed the Heart-linked Pendant, he told Yunyouzi and Ge Yuan everything he knew without reservation, and reminded them in particular that Yu Kong intended to lure Luo Xingnan and Shengyuzi to their deaths and had set traps.

Calculating it, from the time they went into hiding to when Luo Xingnan and his companions appeared, the time in between was not short. Yunyouzi and Ge Yuan had ample opportunity to escape.

But they didn't do that, but instead chose to follow them in.

This puzzled Qin Sang and at the same time made him speculate whether they had some kind of life-saving means, which made them confident that they could calmly escape when they encountered danger.

―――――

Now it seemed that the situation was not going well.

There were also many hooksnakes killed by the cultivators. Some of the snake corpses fell into the abyss, and some smashed into the ground. The huge bodies lay sprawled on the ground, and the blood-soaked ground converged into a river, forming strips of blood-colored waterfalls on the edge of the abyss, gurgling and flowing.

However, the three mid-stage demon spirit hooksnake kings were not among them.

In the fierce battle, their huge bodies could sometimes be seen being knocked out.

Their bodies were also scarred, but their aura was not weakened in the slightest, and they immediately charged back in with a ferocious roar, seeming not to know pain at all after falling into madness.

At this time, the battle in the red fog began to show signs of weakening, and the three strongest hooksnake kings could not be killed.

Moreover, from beginning to end, no one was able to escape with their lives.

Yu Kong had originally planned to attack and kill the three when Luo Xingnan and his companions retreated, but in the end, he discovered that the strength of these hooksnakes was beyond expectations, and they didn't need their help.

Finally, the battle subsided and the red fog dissipated.

The surviving hooksnakes hovered in the air, their mouths full of blood and minced meat, the madness in their giant eyes not having completely disappeared, and their sharp roars rising and falling one after another.

The three strongest hooksnake kings were also covered with scars, which showed that the counterattack of the cultivators before their deaths was very fierce. One of them even had its two tails severed, and blood flowed like a thread,发出阵阵哀鸣。

They seemed to be communicating.

Afterwards, one of the hooksnake kings dragged its seriously injured companion and flew back into the abyss to sleep, while the others landed on the ground to devour the corpses of their kind, and some flew back to their nests.

The hooksnake nest was on the back mountain. With the hooksnakes' huge bodies hidden inside, there was not the slightest trace of demonic energy leaking out, which showed that the depth of the nest was probably not inferior to that of the abyss.

Two mid-stage Foundation Establishment masters, and with a group of helpers, died just like that under the siege of a group of demonic beasts, not one of them survived.

Except for the five people of Yu Kong watching, no one knew that they had died so silently.

They used only a small scheme to easily eliminate two major enemies without any effort.

This result was something that even Yu Kong had not expected.

They had already approached stealthily and were standing behind the stone mountain, watching this great battle from beginning to end, and seeing such a tragic ending, they couldn't help but be shocked.

For a moment, there was a silent silence, and no one spoke.

"Elder Yu..."

Wu Chen swallowed his saliva and spoke to Yu Kong with respect. The scene just now had shocked him greatly.

Yu Kong turned his hand and turned into clouds and covered his hand and rain. In an instant, he wiped out so many Foundation Establishment cultivators. No matter how deep his plan was or how vicious his means were, he would not dare to show any disrespect to Yu Kong again.

"You knew about the existence of these hooksnakes long ago..."

"This mister Yu does know that there are evil demons lurking, not good to deal with, but I didn't expect these evil beasts to be so strong. This mister Yu originally only intended to spare the lives of those two old guys, but unexpectedly these two villains implicated so many innocent people. After going out, this mister Yu will definitely ask someone to give a grand ceremony for fellow daoists to comfort their spirits in heaven..."

Yu Kong sighed sadly and compassionately, but there was a hint of smugness on his face that he could not completely hide.

"However, the great enemy has been eliminated, now the spirit medicine is ours, and by the way, helping us severely injure the guardian demon beast, we can easily escape after picking the medicine. We should be happy, what do you think?"

Yu Kong's gaze swept over, including Qin Sang, and they all nodded in agreement.

"Time is running out, and the restriction has not yet been broken. We must leave before the low point of the guardian magic formation disappears. This mister Yu does not want to be trapped in such a place for thirty years..."

Under Yu Kong's urging, the crowd used their escape techniques and rushed to the distant mountains.

Qin Sang took a last look at the devastated battlefield, pondered for a moment, and turned and left.

They were very careful in their行动。The appearance of the hooksnakes was a warning that this place was not as peaceful as it seemed on the surface.

Beyond these short peaks, other mountains may have their own guardian demons.
Fortunately, the peaks have always been so peaceful.
As they got closer, they found themselves breathing heavily.
Colorful lights penetrated the heavy fog, shot into the sky, and almost blinded them. Qin Sang silently counted them and came up with 21 lights!
In other words, there were 21 spiritual herbs that were at least a thousand years old!
Luo Xingnan just made the dramatic statement that he was going to completely focus on preparing to form a Gold Core once they returned, and if he got these 21 spiritual herbs, he might actually achieve his wish.
Qin Sang looked up slightly, his gaze falling on a location near the top of the peaks where the profound yellow energy was especially bright.
With 21 spiritual herbs, they should have enough for each of them to get four, as long as Yu Kong didn’t get greedy and decide not to play fair.
However, the auras of these spiritual herbs varied, with most of them being weak and dim, and only a few were bright and eye-catching.
The profound yellow energy was one of those three, so that was certainly the most valuable one.
Yu Kong might not be willing to give it up.
“Those Black Widows were probably left by the owner of the cave as guardian demons,” Yu Kong nodded slightly, his voice filled with an excitement that he couldn’t hide as he looked at the spiritual herbs. “Break the enchantment and these spiritual herbs will be ours. For this last part, we’ll need to work together!”
Upon hearing these words, the others reluctantly tore their greedy eyes away from the herbs and looked at the dense fog.
The enchantment was hidden within the dense fog, and they could already sense a hint of danger before even entering it.
This enchantment wasn’t going to be easy to break.
They circled the mountain and tried a few times to find a way up, but the entire mountain was sealed by the dense fog and the enchantment. There was no way up, so they had to give up on that idea.
“We don’t have time to slowly figure out how to break the enchantment. Luckily, I’ve done some research on enchantments. However…”
Yu Kong paused and looked at Qin Sang and the other two. “The enchantment here is very complex and powerful. Someone will have to go inside it to activate its power so that we can see the enchantment clearly. I need to focus on finding a way to break the enchantment, so I’ll need you three to take turns going inside. What do you think, or do you have any other ideas?”
