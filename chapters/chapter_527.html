<h1>Chapter 520: Improvisation</h1><p>Chapter 520: Improvisation</p><p>These caves, like the stone railings, were rough-hewn, merely concealed by stone doors. All the cave entrances were tightly shut, with shimmering禁制光芒 emanating from them.  Shi Ying, having no friends and avoiding her fellow disciples, flew directly into her own cave.</p><p>It was hardly a woman's dwelling; the furnishings were as sparse and the layout as monotonous as Qin Sang's cave.</p><p>Closing the cave entrance, Shi Ying carefully placed the black coffin in a corner, opened it, glanced at the corpse within, and smiled contentedly. She sat cross-legged on the stone bed, opening her storage pouch.</p><p>In her eyes, nothing was more precious than this corpse. Thus, she only refined the few high-quality magical artifacts.  The remaining items, of lesser quality or of uncertain nature, were set aside for later examination.</p><p>Then, Shi Ying sat cross-legged before the black coffin, connecting her consciousness to the soul imprint, eagerly familiarizing herself with the corpse.</p><p>Though not of her own creation, she experienced no difficulty in controlling it, readily mastering its manipulation.</p><p>Gently opening her eyes, Shi Ying's gaze fell upon the corpse's abdomen.  She could hardly believe it, examining it repeatedly with her spiritual sense before confirming the presence of a Golden Core. She wondered how much effort the previous necromancer had expended gathering the necessary components for this corpse; only the Heavenly Firmament Qi was missing.</p><p>"Gangsha Chongdan…"  Shi Ying murmured uncertainly.</p><p>She'd feared her low cultivation might hinder the process, but upon familiarizing herself with the corpse, she found she could manipulate its power effortlessly.  The burden on her was somewhat significant, but with sufficient restorative pills and spirit stones, she was confident she could persevere.</p><p>This outcome boosted her confidence. She decided to proceed with an attempt.</p><p>Unbeknownst to her, this was the result of Qin Sang's deliberate cooperation.</p><p>Shi Ying remained blissfully unaware that the corpse was sentient, its disguise flawless.  This intelligent corpse willingly submitted to control, allowing the soul imprint to be placed.  Even seasoned necromancers would likely find this unheard of.  Qin Sang was unprecedented.</p><p>Shi Ying spent the night familiarizing herself with the corpse's power. By the next morning, her worries were gone.  She sealed the cave and flew towards the Shen Gang Peak.  Her cave was not far, and she soon entered the green mist…</p><p>…The cave plunged into darkness.</p><p>The black coffin lid silently slid open, and the corpse inside slowly sat up, a sight of uncanny strangeness.  Its dark eyes flickered, gradually regaining intelligence and brilliance. Qin Sang severed Shi Ying's soul imprint and turned its neck, surveying the cave.</p><p>He had successfully infiltrated but hadn't immediately controlled Shi Ying as planned. Shi Ying's actions had given him a new idea; he decided to improvise and wait.</p><p>He quickly deduced the reason for her haste.  Wen Yanjie was now at the late Foundation Establishment stage, soon to reach the False Core realm. If Shi Ying didn't hurry, once Wen Yanjie broke through, even with the completed corpse, killing a true False Core cultivator would be extremely difficult.  Revenge would remain a distant dream.</p><p>The fact that his alteration of the secret technique compelled Shi Ying to act swiftly was unexpected.  This was fortunate.</p><p>Cultivators of the Azure Sun Devil Fire could extract a trace of Heavenly Firmament Qi from Shen Gang Peak for their cultivation. Since Shi Ying was willing to help, he might as well accept her assistance.</p><p>Infiltrating Shen Gang Peak was extremely risky.  Qin Sang was still uncertain about the feasibility of Wu Shang's technique; the so-called "Qi Chong Sha" was merely speculation. There was no precedent to guide him.</p><p>By having Shi Ying bring the Heavenly Firmament Qi out, he could remain in her cave and experiment. If the technique proved unworkable, he could still easily leave the Azure Sun Devil Sect.</p><p>Trespassing on Shen Gang Peak held significant risk. Failure of the technique and subsequent exposure would be disastrous.  His corpse energy was still manageable; there was no need to rush.</p><p>Qin Sang floated horizontally towards the cave entrance, glancing at the storage pouch on the bedside table as he passed the bed.</p><p>According to Qingyang Sect disciples, the spiritual energy on Shen Gang Peak is extremely chaotic, increasingly so closer to the summit. Even in the lower regions, lower-level disciples struggle to protect themselves and dare not stay long. They absorb a wisp of Qingyang Divine Energy and immediately return to their caves to refine their demonic flames.</p><p>On Shen Gang Peak, should an accident occur, one can only fight for survival and wait for rescue.  Items carried, such as storage pouches, are likely to be destroyed due to the urgency of the situation.</p><p>Storage pouches are a cultivator's lifeline; no one dares take risks. Thus, lower-level disciples leave their pouches in their caves before entering the mountain.</p><p>Their caves are protected by unique, sect-created wards, preventing theft.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze fell upon his storage pouch, containing his Qingfu coins and Xuantian Thunder Talismans, along with several similar artifacts he'd specially refined. Shi Ying hadn't noticed anything unusual.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't immediately retrieve the artifacts. Instead, he floated to the cave entrance, his palm lightly pressing against the ward.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Points of blue light suddenly appeared on the door, rapidly converging towards the center.</p><p>A moment later, a small, blue flame appeared before Qin Sang.  Though small, it exuded an extremely fierce energy.</p><p>This flame was the Qingyang Demonic Flame left behind by Shi Ying, originating from the same source as the soul mark deep within Qin Sang's spirit, uniquely Shi Ying's.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully investigated, discovering the ingenuity of the Qingyang Sect's wards.  Qingyang Sect disciples infuse their cultivated Qingyang Demonic Flame into the ward. Even fellow disciples who cultivate the same flame cannot replicate it.  If anyone attempts to break the ward, a conflict of flames triggers an immediate alarm.</p><p>Although Qin Sang understood the ward, he dared not tamper with the flame.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang devised a plan, using Shi Ying's soul mark to interact with the ward.</p><p>From a sufficient distance, Shi Ying wouldn't sense the soul mark's movements.  The Qingyang Demonic Flame indeed mistook Qin Sang for its owner, showing no resistance.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't enter. He merely opened a crack in the door, gazing at the distant Shen Gang Peak.</p><p>What a towering peak that pierced the clouds!</p><p>Qin Sang marveled inwardly.  Its grandeur was second only to Zhitian Peak among all the mountains he’d seen, surpassing even Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Truly a magnificent peak reaching the heavens, no wonder it draws down the Heavenly Gan Qi from the nine heavens, nurturing the Gan Ying!</p><p>From the foot to the summit, Qin Sang carefully observed, verifying the information he’d obtained.</p><p>Beneath the dense, lingering blue mist lay the Qingyang Gan Ying. The closer to the summit, the more abundant and pure the Gan Ying became.</p>
