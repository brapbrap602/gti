<h1>Chapter 360: Six Hundred Years</h1><p>Li Yu'fu took Qin Sang's words to heart, vowing to diligently pass on the teachings of his sect and further develop the Qingyang Temple lineage.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the complete copy of the *Youming Scripture* she had bought in You Shan Market and gave it to Li Yu'fu. The basic incantations included in this cultivation technique were carefully selected, providing ample material for Li Yu'fu to study for a while.</p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang chose a few unused magical artifacts from her pouch for Li Yu'fu's self-defense.</p><p>The best among them was the Flying Shuttle, replaced by You Luo Yun, which could be used to escape in case of danger and would serve Li Yu'fu until the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>"Since you call me senior uncle, consider these my welcome gift."</p><p>Qin Sang said with a sigh, "Your current circumstances are far better than mine when I first embarked on the immortal path. Remember to cultivate diligently, never be slack.  Senior Yunyouzi dislikes lazy people..."</p><p>Li Yu'fu nodded repeatedly: "Disciple will surely diligently practice!"</p><p>Then, Qin Sang explained the *Youming Scripture* and some common knowledge of the immortal cultivation world to Li Yu'fu in detail.</p><p>"After sensing spiritual energy, you can use the marrow-nourishing soup to aid your cultivation…"</p><p>"You are not a child; the world is treacherous, I won't teach you that. The immortal cultivation world and the mortal world are not much different—it's a survival of the fittest, a world of intrigue.  You are new to the immortal path and weak. Remember to keep a low profile, don't show off, lest you attract disaster. If you encounter insurmountable trouble, use my token and seek help from Han Family Fort nearby; it will ensure your safety…"</p><p>"Next time we meet, I will inform Senior Yunyouzi of your matter. Wait patiently at Qingyang Temple."</p><p>After paying respects to Daoist Jixin and Mingyue once more, Qin Sang, despite the teacher and student's earnest pleas to stay, set off that night.  In the lingering gazes of the teacher and student, she ascended into the clouds and headed towards Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang remained thoughtful, delaying entering meditation.</p><p>This return to Da Sui brought regrets, reminiscences, and relief…</p><p>Various emotions welled up from her heart.</p><p>Like a gentle breeze, ruffling the surface of a pond.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang slowly closed her eyes, the wind and waves subsided.</p><p>Times had changed.</p><p>Past grievances were settled.</p><p>…</p><p>Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>Her sect was in sight, but Qin Sang didn't stop, flying directly over Shao Hua Mountain and entering the Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>Arriving at a desolate watery area, after cautiously observing, Qin Sang quietly revealed herself, using water-遁术 to submerge and head deeper.</p><p>She went deep underwater.</p><p>Spiritual energy was thin here, and the underwater area was extremely barren.</p><p>Thick mud and sand were covered with clumps of aquatic plants.  Qin Sang, like a fish, moved through the water plants, towards the location she remembered.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang paused slightly, her eyes flashing as she surveyed her surroundings.</p><p>Compared to other places, there was nothing unusual here. Even when Qin Sang searched inch by inch with her divine sense, she could not perceive any anomalies.</p><p>The spiritual spring and the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid were hidden here by Qin Sang!</p><p>The spiritual vein was still a thousand meters deep in the mud and sand. Qin Sang had spent a long time carefully finding this inconspicuous spiritual vein.</p><p>Because the spiritual vein was small, isolated, and the Xuanming Tortoise Shell Formation tightly sealed the spiritual energy, it was now extremely hidden. Even a Golden Core cultivator, unless they turned this place upside down, would not be able to detect the existence of the spiritual vein.</p><p>Although the spiritual vein was hidden, Qin Sang was confident that it would not be discovered, but the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid was too precious, and even in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, she couldn't help but worry about it.</p><p>Upon returning, her first task was to check on the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid.</p><p>"However, I should come here less in the future, as little as possible, just in case…"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to herself.</p><p>Returning to the Yun Cang Great Marsh, Qin Sang did not interact with other cultivators, but from various signs, she could see that the atmosphere in the Great Marsh was indeed tense. Cultivators were hurrying, worried about future changes in the situation.</p><p>The Yun Cang Great Marsh was vast and boundless. If the Tianxing Alliance and Xiao Han Region were to wage war, it would only be in the central area of the marsh. Unless Xiao Han Region completely gave up resistance and retreated steadily, it would not affect this area in the short term, so there was no need to rush to move the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid. Besides, Qin Sang couldn't find a more suitable place for the moment.</p><p>However, the Yun Cang Great Marsh was now a melting pot, and major sects had sent disciples to investigate the situation. If her whereabouts were discovered by someone with ulterior motives along the way, it might expose the existence of the spiritual spring.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang burrowed into the mud and sand and dived straight down.</p><p>Upon reaching the location of the spiritual vein, Qin Sang paused, sensing resistance. She activated the Xuanming Tortoise Shell Formation and stepped inside.</p><p>A wave of potent spiritual energy washed over Qin Sang, bringing a look of contentment to her face.  She eagerly widened her eyes, gazing at the spirit spring.</p><p>The cave dwelling was simple and cramped. In the center, where a large rock had once stood, Qin Sang had carved a space and planted the spirit spring plant.  Now, a clear spring flowed, with the Nine Transformations Heavenly Orchid swaying gracefully at its heart.</p><p>At the sight of the orchid, Qin Sang let out a soft gasp of surprise and delight.  The petals, previously seven-tenths open and a deep purple, resembling a snow-covered ink orchid, were now tightly closed. The vibrant purple had also faded somewhat.</p><p>"This is... the final stage of its seventh transformation, beginning the eighth!" Qin Sang exclaimed joyfully.</p><p>The notes left behind by the master alchemist detailed each transformation of the Nine Transformations Heavenly Orchid.  In the eighth transformation, all color would fade, the petals becoming pure white.  By the ninth, the orchid would mature, its form transforming into that of a common orchid. This process was a return to simplicity.</p><p>Once the purple disappeared completely and the petals bloomed again, the eighth transformation would be complete. Provided the spiritual energy remained abundant and didn't hinder the plant's growth, only one more transformation—and five hundred years—stood between it and maturity.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that the orchid had just begun to close its petals.  She figured the eighth transformation would begin in another twenty or thirty years.  By then, she would be a hundred years old.</p><p>This meant that even without incident, she wouldn't see the orchid mature until she was six hundred years old.  Yet, the lifespan of a Golden Core cultivator was only five hundred years.</p><p>"Six hundred years... I'll have to search for longevity pills..."</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sharp headache coming on.  In the cultivation world, pills extending life by twenty or thirty years were highly sought after. A hundred years was a significant amount of time!  Moreover, it was said that these pills couldn't simply be stacked; their efficacy diminished with each subsequent dose.</p><p>"I can only take things one step at a time.  I haven't even formed my Golden Core yet; there's no point in worrying too much."</p><p>"Regardless, I can't miss the Chance Pill.  A twenty percent chance of forming a Nascent Soul is too tempting, absolutely crucial for me.  Whether it's increasing my lifespan or hastening the orchid's maturity, I must find a way!"</p><p>Qin Sang clenched her fists.</p><p>After squatting beside the pool, gazing at the Nine Transformations Heavenly Orchid for a while, Qin Sang sealed the cave entrance once more.  She then quietly distanced herself before taking flight and departing.</p>
