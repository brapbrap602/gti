<h1>Chapter 2053: Si You</h1><p>Qin Sang returned to the Turbid Wave Sea, and Su Nu also obtained the Bamboo Token.  The two immediately set off for the Begonia Academy.</p><p>True to its name, the waters of the Turbid Wave Sea were noticeably murkier than elsewhere.  Clear waters marked the boundary of the sea, and the Begonia Academy lay to its north, separated by a vast, nameless ocean.</p><p>Nameless meant unclaimed, lawless, and chaotic. It was the most violent region of the Azure Sand Province, yet also the place where fortunes could be made overnight. Such places were common in Azure Sand.</p><p>The two journeyed without pause.  As they neared the Begonia Academy, the world of cultivation grew markedly more peaceful. The occasional cultivator with a fierce aura restrained their savage demeanor, behaving cautiously, unlike the untamed arrogance displayed elsewhere.</p><p>The Begonia Academy valued scholarly decorum, but in the eyes of others, they were by no means pacifists. If any wrongdoing occurred nearby and was discovered by the Academy, even outside its grounds, they wouldn't hesitate to dispatch someone to apprehend the culprit, euphemistically calling it "instruction."</p><p>It was said that once imprisoned in the Begonia Academy's dungeons, no matter how ferocious a person might be, they would spill their every misdeed like beans tumbling from a bamboo tube.  Judged and sentenced, their fate was a life behind bars, never to see the outside world again.</p><p>“The Begonia Academy is just ahead.”</p><p>Su Nu consulted a nautical chart before speaking.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed out, seeing only boundless blue waves, not a single islet in sight.  There were no cultivators, nor any discernible fluctuations of a restrictive formation.</p><p>The Begonia Academy's jurisdiction was vast. Sealing the entire sea and isolating it from external threats would require an immense formation. While the Academy might possess such capabilities, they had chosen not to implement it.</p><p>Theoretically, Qin Sang and Su Nu could conceal their auras and infiltrate the Begonia Academy undetected. However, the Academy undoubtedly possessed detection methods. Moreover, they needed to search for traces of the Otherfolk, potentially requiring a lengthy stay. Such a clandestine approach presented numerous inconveniences and wasn't a viable long-term strategy.</p><p>It was better to present the Gentleman's Token and operate openly within the Academy.</p><p>On the empty sea, not a single figure was visible. Qin Sang and Su Nu maintained their original flight speed, neither hastening nor slowing, and made no effort to conceal their auras.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He ceased his flight and looked eastward.  Su Nu also sensed it then: two cultivators were flying towards them, their purpose clear – they were looking for them.</p><p>“The Begonia Academy truly has a method of remote detection,” Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>Su Nu nodded slightly, pondering, “If we use secret techniques to conceal ourselves, they shouldn't be able to discover us. However, the closer we get to the Academy's core, the stronger their detection methods will surely become.  Qin Xiong, having obtained a  Orchid Token will make things much easier.”</p><p>The two waited briefly where they were. Two streaks of rainbow light flew from the horizon and landed before them, revealing two scholars in long robes, one tall and one short.</p><p>The middle-aged scholar, possessing Nascent Soul cultivation, appraised Su Nu with a glance, a flicker of awe in his eyes. He bowed, saying, “Greetings, Senior.  I am Xie Yuan, humbly serving as the Pavilion Master of She Xi Pavilion.”</p><p>They had already learned that the Begonia Academy divided its territory into numerous "pavilions," with a Pavilion Master overseeing each.  Several immortal officials and soldiers assisted the Pavilion Master in governance.</p><p>Su Nu stepped forward, returning the courtesy with a respectful bow. “Greetings, Master Xie. I have come to visit your esteemed Academy on an important matter. Passing through your jurisdiction, I request your kind assistance.”</p><p>With that, Su Nu produced the Bamboo Token.</p><p>She and Qin Sang had agreed that, since the Orchid Token had a time limit, there was no need to reveal it immediately. They would use the Bamboo Token first, and only resort to the Orchid Token if necessary. After all, holders of the Bamboo Token were entitled to bring along several attendants.</p><p>Xie Yuan received the Bamboo Token with both hands, examined it, and left a trace of his own Qi upon it before returning it to Su Nu. “This token is genuine.  Senior, please proceed as you wish.”</p><p>If it were someone with lower cultivation, they would inevitably be questioned. However, with a powerful figure like Su Nu, whose temperament was unpredictable and authority不容冒犯, someone of higher standing would handle matters further down the line.</p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p>Su Nu bowed once more, clouds forming beneath her feet. She brought along the unassuming Qin Sang, who stood quietly at her side, and they soared through the air. Watching them depart, Xie Yuan sent out a talisman message and then returned to his post.</p><p>With the Bamboo Token paving the way, their journey was indeed unimpeded. They finally stopped temporarily at San Guan Pavilion, one of the furthest pavilions accessible with the Bamboo Token.  They chose Fu Yue Island as their temporary residence.</p><p>The Begonia Academy's emphasis on scholarly decorum created a unique scene of harmonious coexistence between immortals and mortals.  In the tea houses lining the streets, one could often witness cultivators and mortals engaging in lively debates, face to face.  It wasn't uncommon for cultivators to be rendered speechless by the arguments of mortals, yet they were forbidden from using their Daoist arts to exert pressure, only conceding defeat.</p><p>One day, while Su Nu's whereabouts were unknown, Qin Sang ordered a pot of tea at a tea house.  Hearing a debate on the upper floor, he went up to join in the fun, only to discover two Golden Core cultivators arguing over the ownership of a spiritual herb.</p><p>The herb had been discovered jointly by the two, but somehow a conflict had arisen. Their faces flushed with anger, unable to resolve their dispute, they agreed to settle the matter through a contest of skill.  However, their subsequent actions were truly bewildering: they chose to decide the winner through a game of "Flying Flower Order"!</p><p>For cultivators with perfect memories, reciting poems and songs was no great feat.  The Flying Flower Order required composing poems on the spot, with the opponent dictating the meter and theme.  Furthermore, the poems couldn't be mere doggerel; they had to evoke applause from the audience, or a penalty of three cups of wine would be incurred. Losing three times meant defeat.</p><p>The two continuously composed verses, eliciting constant applause from the tea house. Qin Sang marveled, feeling as if he had witnessed something truly extraordinary.</p><p>He looked around at the crowd, almost entirely captivated by the Flying Flower Order, their passion for poetry bordering on fanaticism.  No one seemed to care about the spiritual herb itself.</p><p>"Qin Xiong, why don't you go up and try?"</p><p>Su Nu returned from outside, seeing Qin Sang's amusement, and couldn't help but tease him.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, not rising to the bait. “The vast world holds countless wonders. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have imagined such a scene.”</p><p>The two walked outside. The others, still engrossed in the Flying Flower Order, didn't notice them.</p><p>Glancing back, Su Nu said, "They should be cultivators on the Literary Roll."</p><p>The Begonia Academy maintained both a Literary and a Martial Roll, listing outstanding individuals eligible to cultivate within the Academy. The two rolls had distinct characteristics. Those on the Literary Roll devoted themselves entirely to studying Daoist scriptures and philosophy, rarely dabbling in Daoist techniques or magical powers. They placed little emphasis on combat, preferring scholarly debates. However, as long as the Begonia Academy stood strong, there was no need for them to engage in physical combat.</p><p>Leaving the tea house, Qin Sang transmitted his voice, asking, "Have the Otherfolk made a significant move?"</p><p>During this time, he and Su Nu had been gathering information separately and had already uncovered some clues.</p><p>Su Nu nodded, her expression grave.  “The situation is not ideal. The Otherfolk are moving faster than anticipated, or perhaps something has happened to the two Heavenly Division Otherfolk.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. “Are you certain the two Heavenly Division Otherfolk are hiding in Jiu Si Pavilion?”</p><p>“Barring unforeseen circumstances, they are in Jiu Si Pavilion! Those Otherfolk have been operating in Azure Sand Province for many years. Several experts infiltrated Jiu Si Pavilion long ago using various means.  Recently, another batch of personnel was sent in. Such a large number of people cannot remain hidden for long. They will likely make their move soon.”</p><p>Su Nu's tone was strained.  They had assumed the Otherfolk would proceed gradually, giving them ample time to prepare. Now, with the situation suddenly becoming urgent, they too had to adapt.</p><p>"Jiu Si Pavilion... I recall needing an Orchid Token to reach it," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Su Nu sighed softly. “Those Otherfolk have been operating in Azure Sand for years. It's not surprising they possess such methods. We underestimated them.”</p><p>“We shouldn't delay.  Let's go to Jiu Si Pavilion immediately!” Qin Sang didn't even return to his cave dwelling, heading directly out of the city. His voice was cold. “Even if there are no obvious weaknesses to exploit, we can force them to reveal themselves prematurely and muddy the waters!”</p><p>Leaving the immortal city, the two immediately summoned their flying light.</p><p>Su Nu transmitted her voice, "This is, after all, the Begonia Academy's territory. The situation remains unclear, so we shouldn't alert them for now. I previously planted a mole within that Otherfolk faction. I had planned to activate them when the time was right, but we have to awaken them early."</p><p>The two traversed San Guan Pavilion, reaching its boundary. Then, Qin Sang used the Orchid Token to lead the way. They encountered a few minor obstacles along the way, but resolved them easily, finally arriving near Jiu Si Pavilion.</p><p>To avoid alerting the enemy, they didn't use the Orchid Token to enter, instead concealing their auras and carefully infiltrating.  After flying stealthily for a while, encountering no resistance, they felt reassured and sped towards the location Su Nu had discovered.</p><p>They avoided spirit islands and immortal cities as much as possible, eventually stopping on a desolate reef.</p><p>Su Nu focused her senses for a moment, sat down cross-legged, and said, "That pawn is nearby. Qin Xiong, please protect me."</p><p>Qin Sang responded affirmatively. With a wave of his sleeve, the surrounding sea mist churned, concealing the reef.</p><p>Su Nu closed her eyes, forming hand seals, and executed a secret technique. After a while, her eyes suddenly opened, her pupils becoming profoundly deep, as if capable of drawing in another's spirit. Her gaze shifted slightly, focusing on a particular direction.</p><p>Immediately following, an obscure fluctuation emanated from her pupils, strange and inexplicable, quickly dissipating into nothingness.</p><p>Simultaneously.</p><p>In a distant area of the sea.</p><p>Numerous islands dotted this region, densely populated.  Nearly every island boasted a city, teeming with countless mortals, and cultivators were not uncommon either.</p><p>Yet, none were aware of the approaching danger. Outside these islands, a group of uninvited guests lurked beneath the waves, forming an encirclement, trapping the area within.</p><p>They lay in wait, silent and concealed, biding their time.</p><p>A cluster of vibrant seaweed floated in the sea, unmoved by the ocean currents. The seaweed resembled a large cushion.  Three figures sat cross-legged upon it, sunlight filtering through the seawater illuminating them.</p><p>Using secret techniques and aided by treasures bestowed by their clan's superiors, they remained hidden. Even if cultivators flew above the sea, they would be unable to detect them.</p><p>The three had a peculiar appearance, possessing a pair of grey, pointed ears, shaped like those of a wolf or dog.</p><p>Then, the figure in the center stirred, awakening from meditation. He looked at his companions on either side and said in a low voice, "Brothers, keep watch here.  I've remembered something and need to attend to it. I'll return shortly."</p><p>The two companions were startled awake, somewhat surprised.  "Our superior is setting up the formation and has ordered us to guard this location. Ji Xiong, what else do you need to do? If our superior discovers this and we incur his wrath…"</p><p>“Our superior's plan will not unfold so quickly.  He still needs time to prepare before launching it. There won't be any issues.”</p><p>The man glanced outwards, his voice grave. “This time, several superiors are joining forces and proceeding with such caution. Our adversary must be extremely powerful.  If they choose this area to escape, we will be in danger. We must be prepared for any eventuality and make as many preparations as possible to ensure our survival. I was previously refining a protective treasure, which is nearing completion. This treasure can be wielded jointly by the three of us, amplifying its power. However, the refining process creates quite a commotion, which could alert the enemy. I'll move further away and might be able to finish it before the operation commences. If you encounter any problems, send me a message.”</p><p>The two exchanged glances and replied, "Very well. Ji Xiong, make haste and return quickly!"</p><p>The man nodded, detached himself from the seaweed, and silently surfaced, heading in a specific direction.</p><p>The unusual color in Su Nu's eyes gradually faded. She let out a soft breath and said, "He's coming," briefly explaining the situation.</p><p>It turned out that after discovering the Otherfolk faction, Su Nu had wanted to plant a mole within their ranks. She ultimately chose this man named Ji Chou and implanted a Seed of Consciousness, intending to control him.</p><p>He was from the Quan Feng Clan and followed a Void Transformation Stage Second Level Otherfolk expert, holding a high position and having access to confidential information. Even for Su Nu, silently controlling such an expert wasn't easy, as she also had to avoid detection by the Otherfolk superiors.</p><p>The Seed of Consciousness method could be employed without arousing suspicion.  Once the Seed within him nurtured a Spirit Spring, the man would remain completely unaware of his compromised state, yet he would execute Su Nu's commands without question.</p><p>Su Nu had been contacting this individual at intervals, implanting Seeds of Consciousness. The Spirit Spring hadn't fully formed yet.  Forcefully activating it now would render the seed useless afterward, which was somewhat regrettable, but necessary to gather information.</p><p>The man, completely oblivious to being controlled, landed on the reef. His eyes were vacant, as if he had fallen into a trance, muddle-headed.</p><p>Shortly after, Su Nu released her technique and looked at Qin Sang, her expression somewhat strange.</p><p>"This man knows quite a bit.  I've learned that those two Heavenly Division Otherfolk belong to the Si You Clan."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Su Nu's expression. "Is there something peculiar about the Si You Clan?"</p><p>“The world is composed of Yin and Yang, but the Si You Clan are hermaphroditic!”</p><p>Some unique insects, beasts, and plant spirits exhibited this characteristic, but it was relatively rare among beings possessing human-level intelligence. Su Nu couldn't help but express her astonishment. No wonder they hadn't been able to determine their gender before.</p><p>“Precisely because Yin and Yang are unified within them, the Si You Clan possess a unique magical power. Si You Clan members have a hollow aperture on their forehead where Yin and Yang intertwine, a place where spiritual essence is nurtured and where they can give birth to spirit beasts that obey their commands. Each Si You Clan member has powerful companion beasts, up to four.</p><p>“Unlike human beast cultivators, due to the companion beasts being born from the spiritual essence within the hollow aperture, they are essentially one with the Si You Clan member.  Not only are they adept at transformation techniques, but they can also switch places with their master within a certain range, allowing them to escape danger. Unless both the master and all companion beasts are eliminated simultaneously, it's extremely difficult to kill them.</p><p>“However, this method has limitations. For example, each time it's used, the companion beast temporarily dissipates and requires time to regenerate.</p><p>“Those two Si You Clan members only have one companion beast left, hidden on an island ahead. The Otherfolk plan to trap the companion beast and, when the master uses their power to switch places, capture them in one fell swoop!”</p><p>()</p>
