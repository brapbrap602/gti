Chapter 627: Talisman Fragments


Qin Sang put away the three jade slips and looked within.


In his dantian, a five-colored golden core resided at the center, slowly rotating.


The golden core contained the beauty of the Great Dao, mesmerizing and indescribable.


Compared to it, the sealed bluish-black corpse core nearby seemed much inferior.


However, the power gap between the golden core and the corpse core wasn't significant at the moment; the corpse core might even be slightly stronger. One gathered Qin Sang's entire essence, energy, and spirit, while the other was refined from another cultivator's golden core and fused with罡煞.


Only after Qin Sang reached the middle stage of Core Formation would a clear difference emerge.


Unlike Qin Sang's expectations, the golden core was primarily wood-green, and his true essence had also been replaced by wood-attribute spiritual power during the spiritual energy infusion upon core formation.


The "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" itself didn't have any elemental attributes.


Qin Sang's foundation was built upon the water-attribute cultivation method "Netherworld Scripture." Later, he practiced the "Mysterious Female Jade Cauldron Scripture" and the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter," always with water-attribute spiritual power as the main element, without any adverse effects on his cultivation.


He hadn't expected this change after forming his core.


It must have been because of the ebony sword.


When he first started practicing the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" and selected his spirit sword, he had the choice of metal, wood, water, fire, or earth elemental materials. Qin Sang only had the ebony sword embryo, so he naturally chose to refine spiritual wood.


After forming his core, the cultivation method changed on its own due to the ebony sword.


It seemed that the natal spirit sword would play a more significant role in the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" and the cultivator's future than Qin Sang had imagined.


He wondered what the complete "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" would be like at higher realms.


Qin Sang yearned for it but had no clue about the complete cultivation method. He could only follow the path paved by Senior Qingzhu, taking one step at a time.


He would consider these matters after reaching Nascent Soul.


If only Senior Qingzhu were still alive; perhaps he would have already created the post-Nascent Soul cultivation method.


Qin Sang prayed for Senior Qingzhu in his heart, then shifted his gaze from the golden core to other areas.


At this moment, the only word to describe his qi sea was chaotic!


Besides the golden core and the corpse core, there was also a mass of gray qi and some golden talisman fragments!


During core formation, Qin Sang had sensed Cui Xuanzi's visit but didn't go out immediately because he was examining these two things.


Those talisman fragments were remnants of the restraining talisman placed on him by Duke Dongyang.


As Qin Sang had hoped, the talisman was indeed broken during the spiritual energy infusion, but it wasn't completely expelled. Some fragments remained in his dantian.


The joy of successful core formation was somewhat dampened by the stubborn talisman.


Was this the method of a Nascent Soul ancestor? Even a casual restraining talisman was so troublesome?


He tried circulating his golden core and urging his true essence, discovering a subtle sluggishness due to the talisman fragments. Under normal circumstances, this sluggishness wouldn't have much impact.


However, in a life-or-death battle against a powerful enemy, it could cause a slight delay in casting spells or activating magical treasures, giving the enemy a significant advantage.


Qin Sang attempted to break the fragments himself but found them incredibly tough despite being broken. With his current strength, he couldn't forcefully break them. He would have to wait until he reached the late stage of Core Formation.


Even a Nascent Soul cultivator might find the complete talisman difficult to handle!


Back then, if the jade Buddha hadn't protected his primordial spirit and he hadn't retained some fighting ability, even if Chen Yan had snatched him from Duke Dongyang, he wouldn't have been able to remove the talisman in a short time, nor would he have been able to escape on his own.


Qin Sang had to admit that Duke Dongyang was indeed cautious and meticulous, only miscalculating the jade Buddha.


After trying many methods to no avail, Qin Sang finally gave up, deciding to leave it alone for now.


The talisman fragments' influence on him wasn't insignificant, but neither was it devastating. At least, he didn't need to worry about it during the early stage of Core Formation.


Qin Sang tried cultivating and found that the cultivation method needed to be completed cycle by cycle, and haste made waste. The sluggishness caused by the talisman fragments wouldn't be a hindrance.


This relieved most of his worries.


As for the impact during combat, he could compensate with an external core.


The golden core was the most crucial thing for a Core Formation cultivator. They generally wouldn't dare to let their golden core leave their body and be attacked by enemies. At best, their golden core would be damaged, and at worst, their cultivation would plummet.


There were no such concerns with an external core. In a critical situation, Qin Sang could move the external core out of his qi sea, eliminating the restriction of the talisman fragments.


However, Qin Sang didn't know how to enhance the external core yet.


When Qin Sang's cultivation reached the middle stage of Core Formation, the external core would become insufficient, only being helpful during the early stage.


The hidden danger of the talisman fragments had to be addressed eventually.


Asking someone to remove the talisman required lowering his defenses and opening his qi sea, which was equivalent to handing his life over to someone else. Qin Sang wouldn't consider it.


After much thought, Qin Sang came up with only two solutions before reaching the late stage of Core Formation.


Either he studied the Dao of Talismans himself to find a solution,


Or, he relied on another spiritual energy infusion!


Qin Sang only knew how to use talismans and had no foundation in the Dao of Talismans. Furthermore, he lacked a true inheritance in the Dao of Talismans and would have to find one first, starting from scratch.


The difficulty was too great.


Whether it was refining tools or crafting talismans, both required vast resources.


He had long decided to follow the path of refining tools. To cultivate the Dao of Talismans concurrently, Qin Sang didn't think he had the time or energy.


Because of his cultivation method, his cultivation speed had indeed increased, but he couldn't be reckless.


At any time, his own cultivation was the foundation, and Qin Sang wouldn't put the cart before the horse.


Insect control was different. Qin Sang had the true inheritance of the Spirit Controlling Sect and happened to land in the territory of the Wu tribe, who excelled at insect control. Coupled with the divine medicine Redfire Gilded Gold, it was much easier than the Dao of Talismans.


If he could learn from the Wu tribe and refine a natal insect gu…


Then, when the natal insect gu completed its third transformation and drew in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, he could store it in his qi sea, using the opportunity to sweep away the talisman fragments.


The natal insect gu's transformation and the influx of spiritual energy might injure Qin Sang if not properly controlled, but the danger wasn't significant.


Choosing the path of the natal insect gu meant giving up on a natal magical treasure. The two were mutually exclusive.


However, Qin Sang was different from others. This choice wasn't difficult.


He already had the ebony sword.


He could have both a natal magical treasure and a natal insect gu!


After some deliberation, Qin Sang made up his mind and decided to go out and meet Cui Xuanzi.


Now that he had obtained the Wu tribe's natal insect gu technique, Qin Sang realized that he could cultivate it and reap its numerous benefits, further strengthening his resolve to refine a natal insect gu.


The talisman fragments were merely a minor ailment.


What truly worried Qin Sang was the mass of gray qi.


He was certain that his qi sea was normal before Duke Dongyang placed the restraining talisman on him.


This gray qi appeared after he was restrained by the talisman and lost control of his qi sea. Qin Sang only discovered its existence after forming his core and breaking the talisman!
