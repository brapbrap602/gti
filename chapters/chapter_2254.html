<h1>Chapter 2244: The Water and Fire Spirit Wheel</h1><p>Tianjing Gate was just ahead. Who would have guessed that someone would dare ambush them near the mountain gate?</p><p>Qi Bo was also somewhat relaxed due to their proximity to the mountain gate, when suddenly they were attacked. However, after carefully observing the formation, Qi Bo realized that even if he had been more cautious, he might not have been able to detect the trap.</p><p>This formation was incredibly intricate; in some aspects, it even surpassed Tianjing Gate's protective mountain array.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Mountains shifted, the earth shook.</p><p>These peaks seemed to have become their enemies, surrounding them and creating immense psychological pressure.</p><p>Suddenly, a blaze erupted from a mountaintop, the flames dazzling, immediately spewing out magma.</p><p>The magma surged, falling onto the earth, igniting the ground around the peaks.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>…</p><p>Volcanoes erupted one after another, scorching heat swept over, turning the land into a sea of fire.</p><p>They were in the very heart of the fiery sea, magma flowed beneath their feet, tongues of fire danced wildly, threatening to lick the flying artifacts beneath them.</p><p>At the same time, a dark cloud appeared in the sky.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The thunder served as a signal, instantly unleashing a torrential downpour.</p><p>The rain poured down like a string of pearls; its intensity resembled a celestial river pouring down, submerging the earth.</p><p>While rain fell from the sky, the magma continued to erupt below. The rain falling into the sea of fire did not extinguish the flames, but instead seemed to intensify them.</p><p>The raindrops above were as thick as the sea, and below was also a sea, a sea of fire.  At the boundary of water and fire, no steam formed; instead, the two forces, usually opposing, coexisted harmoniously, creating a bizarre spectacle.</p><p>“Qi Bo, what kind of formation is this?”</p><p>Chen Yuze felt uneasy.</p><p>Seeing the convergence of water and fire, three words immediately sprang to Chen Yuze's mind—Yuanjing Mountain!</p><p>They had just plotted against Yuanjing Mountain, and on their return journey, they were ambushed, using this very formation.  No one would believe it was a coincidence.</p><p>However, only two people in Yuanjing Mountain could be considered masters: the sect leader, Tongshen Shangren, and his young disciple, Qingfeng.</p><p>Qi Bo had just encountered Qingfeng, and judged him to have only recently broken through. Without the protection of Yuanjing Mountain's array, Qi Bo could have easily defeated him.</p><p>As for Tongshen Shangren, he was unwilling to leave seclusion even when attacked, only emerging to ambush them after the incident had subsided. This seemed illogical, unless Tongshen Shangren had already broken through a bottleneck!</p><p>At this thought, Chen Yuze felt a surge of panic.  If Tongshen Shangren had indeed broken through, his cultivation would be on par with his father's, and Qi Bo would likely be unable to protect him!</p><p>Qi Bo also realized this, and transmitted a message: “Tongshen Shangren's breakthrough would inevitably trigger celestial phenomena, which would be noticed by Qingjiang Sect's spies. The Qingjiang Sect leader would surely send a warning. I suspect our former enemies are disguising themselves as Yuanjing Mountain inheritors to deceive us.  Hmph! A clever ploy!  If they succeed, they can shift the blame. This formation isolates the inside and out, shielding the young master's blood talisman. I'll try to break this formation. When you see an opportunity, don't hesitate, immediately send a blood talisman for help…”</p><p>They never imagined that it was Qin Sang who had ambushed them!</p><p>As he spoke, Qi Bo summoned a white scroll.  The scroll unfurled, revealing a drawing of countless blades, each different in shape and size, but all razor-sharp, a depiction of a blade array.</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>As the blade array unfurled, countless blade shadows shot out, precisely mirroring the shapes in the drawing.</p><p>The blade shadows encircled Chen Yuze and his two maidservants, the gleaming blades pointing outwards, incredibly sharp. Anyone wishing to attack them would first have to break through this blade array.</p><p>Protecting Chen Yuze with the blade array allowed Qi Bo to act freely.</p><p>Just as Qi Bo activated the blade array, the scene above and below underwent another transformation.</p><p>Within the rain clouds and earthfire, two vortices formed, spinning in opposite directions. If Qi Bo and the others could see inside the vortices, they would have seen two pieces, one of water and one of fire, each surrounded by the respective element. These small pieces actually stirred the wind and clouds!</p><p>Water and fire were manipulated by the water and fire pieces, and with a boom, like a dragon's roar, two giant dragons emerged.</p><p>A water dragon emerged from the clouds, a fire dragon was born from the flames. One blue, one red, their bodies immense, their power awe-inspiring!</p><p>They were not true Azure Dragons, but rather extremely pure water and fire energy, their cores being water and fire chess pieces.</p><p>Seeing this, Qibai's heart sank, feeling immense pressure. He immediately cast a spell.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A spiritual blade flew from his dantian, but it had only a hilt, no blade.</p><p>The next moment, the hilt burst forth with dazzling light, condensing a long blade out of thin air. The blade was slightly slanted, aimed at the fire dragon, and he struck three times.</p><p>'Swish swish swish!'</p><p>The blade's energy merely grazed a mountain peak, and the summit instantly turned to dust, demonstrating its power.</p><p>The three blade energies were incredibly swift, striking the fire dragon's head, body, and tail.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the two dragons changed even faster. The water dragon plunged downwards, the fire dragon soared upwards, meeting in mid-air before circling each other.</p><p>The water and fire converged, forming a red and blue disc, like two fish made of water and fire, with the chess pieces as their eyes, constantly rotating.</p><p>Qin Sang's imitation of the Yin and Yang fish using the water and fire chess pieces was not arbitrary.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>The three blade energies struck the disc and shattered instantly.</p><p>Qibai's eyes narrowed. He clearly sensed that the pressure from the water and fire disc wasn't overwhelmingly strong, yet the power it unleashed in that instant far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, this was Qin Sang's only perfected technique after years of cultivating the Water-Fire Harmony method, called the Water-Fire Spirit Wheel!</p><p>After refining the two chess pieces, the Water-Fire Spirit Wheel was finally complete.  This technique was incredibly versatile, both offensive and defensive. The ceaseless rotation of water and fire not only possessed unparalleled power but also other unique applications, all of which would be tested on Qibai.</p><p>At this time, amplified by the spirit array, the Water-Fire Spirit Wheel's power increased even further, easily shattering the blade energies.</p><p>"It's said that the Yuanjing Mountain cultivates the Water-Fire Harmony method…"</p><p>Qibai, who hadn't understood how to achieve Water-Fire Harmony, gained a glimmer of understanding upon seeing the water and fire disc, causing his heart to tighten.</p><p>Could it be that the Transcendent Sage has truly left seclusion?</p><p>A sudden thought struck Qibai, and he cried out inwardly, for he found that his control over his life-bound spiritual blade had inexplicably become sluggish.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>The spiritual blade trembled, its energy surging, yet unable to strike.</p><p>It seemed to be bound by a powerful force, emanating from the Water-Fire Spirit Wheel.</p><p>Qibai repeatedly changed his incantations, forcibly activating a blade technique, finally managing to deliver a blow.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The blade energy struck the Water-Fire Spirit Wheel, but failed to completely sever its power, instead triggering a greater change, causing the Water-Fire Spirit Wheel to erupt.</p><p>'Whoosh…whoosh…'</p><p>'Splash…splash…'</p><p>Endless flames and rain surged towards them.</p><p>They were trapped, surrounded by water on one side and fire on the other, the water and fire overwhelming and inescapable.</p><p>'Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Two completely different forces continuously bombarded them.</p><p>It was unimaginable that someone could simultaneously control water and fire, not only preventing conflict, but also making them complement each other, each wave stronger than the last.</p><p>Qibai and the blade array were trapped at the boundary between water and fire, desperately resisting.  His heart grew heavier and heavier; the enemy's strength was far stronger than anticipated, and he hadn't found a way to break through.</p><p>Suddenly, a series of crisp impacts sounded behind Qibai, causing his face to change drastically.</p><p>Chen Yuze and his two maidservants were filled with panic. The blade array around them suddenly went haywire, the blade shadows flickering erratically, even colliding with each other.</p><p>Sharp energy danced around them, causing them to fear that the blade array wouldn't protect them, but instead dismember them.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The first blade shadow flew away, followed by the second, then the third…</p><p>These blade shadows were somehow being drawn away, vanishing from their sight in an instant.</p><p>Qibai hadn't expected the enemy to break the blade array in such a way. He quickly summoned an iron whip, lashing it out to wrap around Chen Yuze's waist, pulling him to his side before the blade array could be completely broken.</p><p>The two maidservants weren't so lucky. They were sucked away along with the remnants of the array, leaving only tiny splashes; their fate was likely grim.</p><p>Chen Yuze, ignoring the two beautiful maidservants, trembled, "Qibai, what do we do now?"</p><p>The blade array had been broken so quickly, and Qibai didn't seem to be the enemy's match. Even more terrifying was that they couldn't even see their enemy.</p><p>Qi Bo had no time to answer.  In the short time he spent rescuing Chen Yuze, his life-bound spirit blade almost slipped from his control!</p><p>"Break!"</p><p>Qi Bo's eyes, bloodshot and furious, glared.  The spirit blade unleashed its most brilliant blade energy yet.  Then, several beams of spiritual light flew from Qi Bo, following the opening created by the blade energy.</p><p>These lights were talismans and magical artifacts.  Qi Bo, unable to delay any longer, used every means at his disposal to create an opening in the formation, giving Chen Yuze a chance to escape.</p><p>'Buzz buzz!'</p><p>The blade energy was the first to fade.  The spirit blade dimmed, its formless blade dissipating, leaving only the hilt.  Then, a torrent of water and fire surged, instantly washing the hilt away.</p><p>Qi Bo ignored it, pushing himself to the limit with his other methods.  Chen Yuze, beside him, was visibly tense, clutching a blood talisman, his palm sweating.</p><p>"Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!"</p><p>Chen Yuze urged inwardly, his gaze fixed ahead.  Once an opening appeared in the formation, the blood talisman would transmit a distress signal.</p><p>One by one, the spiritual lights extinguished, leaving only one.  It seemed poised to break through the formation.</p><p>Chen Yuze rejoiced, then felt a sudden constriction.</p><p>"Who!"</p><p>Qi Bo roared, delivering a powerful palm strike to his rear, revealing a hidden artifact: a three-tiered golden pagoda, surprisingly heavy.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>A crisp sound echoed as a hand intercepted the pagoda, revealing a figure and the ethereal form of a green luan .</p><p>Although Qi Bo blocked Qin Sang's attack, Chen Yuze was sucked into the water and fire vortex.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Qi Bo raged, "Damn demon!"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.  If he hadn't wanted to capture Chen Yuze alive, he wouldn't have gone to such lengths.</p><p>Having successfully captured Chen Yuze, Qin Sang finally unleashed his full power, vanishing into the shadows.</p><p>The water and fire pressed in relentlessly. From the outside, the center of the vortex showed a swirling mass of water and fire, within which a figure was trapped, struggling against the forces, their efforts weakening, unable to break free.</p><p>…</p><p>Tianjing Gate.</p><p>In a grand hall, an elder meditated.  This was where the soul lamps of Tianjing Gate’s cultivators were kept, indicators of their fate.</p><p>One soul lamp flickered, then suddenly extinguished.</p><p>The elder's eyes snapped open, widening in disbelief.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh…'</p><p>Streams of light shot up from various parts of the mountain gate.  The elders, alerted, rushed to the scene, their gazes fixed on the extinguished soul lamp below the sect leader's seat, their expressions a mix of shock and rage.</p><p>"Qi Bo went out with the young master.  The young master…"</p><p>An elder's voice trembled, "If something happened to the young master, how can we face the sect leader?"</p><p>Suddenly, a tremor came from beyond the mountain gate.</p><p>The elders exchanged glances, swiftly leaving the gate.  They soon found the source of the tremor: a ravaged battlefield.  They gasped at the sight of three corpses – Qi Bo and two maidservants.  Qi Bo had been killed near the mountain gate!</p><p>"Quickly, check the young master's soul lamp," the Tianjing Gate's Grand Elder ordered, finding no trace of Chen Yuze.</p><p>"Reporting to the Grand Elder, the young master's soul lamp is still lit," someone replied.</p><p>At the mountain gate, Qi Bo lay dead, the young master missing.  Was this a display of power, or a threat?</p><p>The Tianjing Gate cultivators were filled with fear and anxiety.</p><p>"Grand Elder," an elder carefully examined Qi Bo's body, then flew to the Grand Elder, whispering, "There's something strange about Qi Bo's corpse.  And… there's a demonic aura here!"</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang had brought Chen Yuze to a secluded place. Before he could threaten or search Chen Yuze's mind, Chen Yuze spilled the beans, revealing everything.</p><p>Tianjing Gate's framing of the Yuanjing Mountain indeed held a hidden truth. Qi Bo and Chen Yuze were sent by the Tianjing Gate's sect leader.</p><p>Qin Sang found this odd. According to Chen Yuze, Tianjing Gate had never considered interfering with Qingtuo River, and few within the sect even knew of Yuanjing Mountain before.  The sect leader's order was a private instruction.</p><p>The Tianjing Gate's sect leader, though not a member of the Celestial Guard, held a position in the Celestial City and often left the mountain. This time, he had an important task he needed to perform.  Before leaving, he gave them poison and ordered them to go to the Qingtuo River to scheme and force the Transcendent God to leave his seclusion.</p><p>The Transcendent God was a member of the Celestial Guard.  Tianjing Gate attacking Yuanjing Mountain without reason would attract the attention of the Celestial City, so they used the Qingjiang Sect.</p><p>They should have remained behind the scenes. Chen Yuze, acting on his own initiative, revealed himself due to his lust for a woman. He never intended to actually help Yuanjing Mountain. His plan was to win favor with Qinghong and Shuangluo, then find an excuse to leave.  This would make it easier for him to win over the women later, but he hadn't anticipated the poison being discovered.</p><p>"Was it merely to prevent the Transcendent God's breakthrough?"</p><p>Qin Sang had asked all of the Transcendent God's friends, none of whom knew of any grievances between him and Tianjing Gate.</p>
