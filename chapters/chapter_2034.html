<h1>Chapter 2025: The Dark Spirit</h1><p>These Gall Crystals might even have wondrous effects on a Six Transformations Heavenly Eye Butterfly, truly an unexpected harvest.</p><p>‘Buzz… Buzz…’</p><p>As Qin Sang approached the flowering tree, the sacrificial insects, sensing a threat, went into a frenzy to protect the Gall Crystals.</p><p>The swarm enveloped Qin Sang, accompanied by a frantic buzzing, constantly emitting visible yellow ripples that assaulted Qin Sang’s Nascent Soul.</p><p>Qin Sang stood within the swirling vortex, yet remained completely unaffected, his gaze clear as he drew closer to the flowering tree.</p><p>Seeing their attacks were ineffective, the frenzied sacrificial insects began to hurl their bodies against Qin Sang, only to be flung back by the Bright Mountain Armor he wore. Some shattered to pieces on impact, a futile effort.</p><p>Qin Sang, completely unscathed, reached the flowering tree, plucked a flower pod, hefted it, and then satisfied, stowed it away.</p><p>This action further enraged the sacrificial insects.  Several unique insects flew out from the swarm, several times larger than the others, with sharp fangs flanking their mandibles. They unleashed ear-piercing shrieks at Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing these special sacrificial insects, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>The Witch Tribes’ methods of cultivating sacrificial insects were closely guarded secrets within each tribe. He didn’t know how to cultivate them, nor could he subdue this swarm.  However, he could try taking these special insects with him, perhaps uncovering some clues.</p><p>Sacrificial insects weren't just useful for rituals and producing Gall Crystals; they had many other applications.</p><p>He didn't have a Witch Tribe backing him, but he had the entire Storm Realm. If he could cultivate his own sacrificial insects, it would benefit the whole realm. However, the difficulty of cultivating them was immense, and Qin Sang wasn’t particularly confident.</p><p>Sword light flashed.  Easily bisecting dozens of insects, he appeared above one of the special sacrificial insects.</p><p>The special insect was incredibly ferocious, daring to attack the Grey Warbler Sword. But enveloped by the sword light, it struggled left and right, unable to break free, then was dragged back by the sword light.</p><p>Qin Sang restrained it, temporarily storing it within his Spirit Beast Pouch, and then repeated the process, capturing each special sacrificial insect.</p><p>The surrounding insect cloud thinned considerably. The flowerbed was covered with insect corpses.  With their leaders captured, the swarm’s offensive power greatly diminished.</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air came from behind.  Servant Pei caught up, his gaze sweeping across the flowering tree. The flower pods containing the Gall Crystals had been taken by Qin Sang, but the lingering fragrance was unmistakable.</p><p>His pupils constricted, and Servant Pei gave Qin Sang a deep look.  "Elder Qin seems quite knowledgeable about this place?"</p><p>"I'm not entirely devoted to Artifact Refinement. I also raise a few Spirit Insects.  Rumor has it that our human Insect Control techniques initially stemmed from the Witch Tribes' heritage. Curiosity piqued, I collected some ancient texts and came across quite a few records about the Witch Tribes’ insect control techniques. It's a pity that relations between humans and Witch Tribes are strained now, with the Bountiful Jade Gate acting as an insurmountable barrier. Otherwise, I might have personally visited the Witch Tribes to seek instruction," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Elder Qin is indeed erudite," Servant Pei nodded, offering a compliment. Whether he believed Qin Sang's explanation was known only to himself.</p><p>At this moment, the Xin family members also caught up. Even if they guessed there might be treasures here, since even Servant Pei didn’t investigate further, they dared not ask more questions.</p><p>With the threat of the sacrificial insects neutralized, the group continued forward. Unexpectedly, they didn’t find an entrance to a lower level. The space ahead seemed to stretch infinitely, with undulating mountains, becoming increasingly desolate and gradually darkening, a constant reminder that they might be inside a tomb.</p><p>Flying swiftly for a while, they encountered no further danger, but they did come across an unusual scene.</p><p>Atop a mountain ahead, a uniquely shaped platform had been constructed.  Not a single blade of grass could be found on this mountain.  The rocks looked as if they had been dyed with ink, giving the entire mountain a sinister aura.</p><p>It was empty, yet the sight made everyone stop, hesitant to approach.</p><p>The platform occupied almost the entire summit. With cliffs on three sides, a stone staircase led directly to the foot of the mountain, clearly a deliberate construction.  And the marks on the staircase weren’t solely from weathering; they showed signs of prolonged use.</p><p>This indicated that someone had once lived here!</p><p>Gazing at the platform from afar, Servant Pei asked, "Elder Qin, with your vast knowledge, do you recognize the purpose of that platform?"</p><p>"It might be a sacrificial altar used by the Witch Tribes."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. In ancient times, Witch Tribes often built their altars on the highest points, believing it facilitated better communication with Heaven and Earth.</p><p>This mountain was indeed the highest peak in the vicinity.</p><p>With sacrificial insects and a sacrificial altar, could this be the dwelling place of a Witch Tribe? But who would build their dwelling to resemble a tomb?</p><p>Qin Sang found this place increasingly perplexing.</p><p>"The Witch Tribes again!" Servant Pei frowned.</p><p>The Witch Tribes and humans had different heritages. Some things couldn’t be understood with common sense, and unexpected variables might arise, exceeding his control.</p><p>"If I recall correctly, Young Master Xin has never displayed Witch Tribe divine abilities," Servant Pei stared into Young Master Xin's eyes.</p><p>His gaze alone placed immense pressure on Young Master Xin.  Her delicate body trembled slightly as she whispered, "Senior Pei is correct. Father never mentioned the Witch Tribes to me."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Servant Pei's expression shifted subtly.  "So, Young Master Xin is also unaware of this place's connection to the Witch Tribes?"</p><p>In that case, the Xin family might not be as familiar with this tomb as he had initially assumed.</p><p>A flicker of nervousness crossed Steward Luo’s eyes.  A Void Refinement expert’s gaze was too sharp.  No clue could escape their eyes.  If they deemed the Xin family to be of no further value, the roles would reverse, and the best outcome for the Xin family would be a small share of the spoils.  They might even be kicked out entirely.</p><p>Young Master Xin remained relatively composed.  "Father indeed hasn't personally entered this place. He only obtained some clues about it, leading to his deductions.  There might be some information that Father wasn't certain about, fearing it might lead me astray, so he didn’t mention it."</p><p>"Is that so? It seems inviting Elder Qin was the right decision," Servant Pei smiled, turning to Qin Sang. "Elder Qin understands the Witch Tribes far better than us.  For the remainder of our journey, we'll have to trouble Elder Qin for his guidance."</p><p>"I'll do my best," Qin Sang replied indifferently.</p><p>The group bypassed the sacrificial altar and continued onward. Flying over countless mountains, they suddenly heard the sound of rushing water coming from ahead.</p><p>It was the sound of waves crashing against the shore. Flying further, they indeed saw a body of water, a vast expanse like an ocean, stretching as far as the eye could see, an ocean existing within a tomb!</p><p>The waves were gentle, lapping against the reefs.  Strangely, the seawater was black.</p><p>There were no islands on the surface, and the depths, like the seawater, were pitch black as ink, appearing profoundly mysterious.</p><p>"Is it still further ahead?" Servant Pei looked towards Young Master Xin.</p><p>Young Master Xin nodded.</p><p>"I'll lead the way. Follow closely behind me.  Elder Qin will take the rear.  If anything unexpected happens, it’ll prevent you from being caught off guard.  Elder Qin, what are your thoughts?"  Servant Pei made the arrangements.</p><p>Elder Qin had no objections.</p><p>This formation seemed advantageous to the Xin family, but Servant Pei completely disregarded Young Master Xin's opinion.  The Xin family cultivators noticed the change in Servant Pei's attitude.  Gazing at the gloomy sky ahead, they felt the future was uncertain, their hearts filled with apprehension.</p><p>Unable to discern anything from the shore, the group followed Servant Pei's arrangement and flew out over the land, continuing toward the depths of the black sea.</p><p>The pitch-black seawater, devoid of any visible life beneath the surface, the absence of any sound besides the waves, the eerie environment—all of it heightened everyone's tension.</p><p>Servant Pei claimed he would lead the way, but after flying for a distance, as if sensing something, he unceremoniously ordered two Xin family cultivators to scout ahead.</p><p>The two cultivators looked at Young Master Xin, but she couldn't openly defy Servant Pei and could only silently nod.</p><p>The vast sea surface was unobstructed, and there was no sense of danger beneath the water.  Just when everyone thought Servant Pei was being overly cautious, they were astonished to see the two Xin family cultivators vanish before their eyes.</p><p>The Xin family members' faces paled. "What happened?  Where did Fifth Brother and the other go?"</p><p>A hint of a smile played on Servant Pei's lips. He turned to Qin Sang. "Elder Qin, have you noticed anything?"</p><p>"Spatial distortion!"</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>Ahead, everything appeared normal, but it was actually two distinct spaces, as if two different Small Thousand Worlds had been stitched together.  Fractured space was common in the Bountiful Jade Gate, but such a calm, almost imperceptible one, with seamless transitions, was a first.</p><p>"That may not be the reason.  It could be some kind of formation," Servant Pei shook his head.</p><p>Light flickered ahead, and the two Xin family cultivators reappeared, relieved expressions on their faces upon seeing the group. Evidently, they had also lost sight of everyone.</p><p>The group entered the space ahead, discovering an identical black sea, only the wind was stronger than before.</p><p>Continuing to fly for a while, the wind intensified, and the sky grew even darker.</p><p>"Something's not right."</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>"Indeed.  Be careful. Where's that treasured bell from before? Bring it out!" Servant Pei ordered the Xin family cultivators without a hint of courtesy.</p><p>Young Master Xin complied, summoning the bell. Its radiant light enveloped the Xin family cultivators.</p><p>At the same time, a fierce wind whipped up around them.  In an instant, dark clouds filled the sky, and the rumble of thunder echoed across the sea.</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>Lightning flashed and thunder roared in the clouds, heralding an approaching storm.</p><p>Initially, the group remained relaxed, but their composure quickly vanished as lightning converged above them from all directions, gathering in increasing intensity. A terrifying aura settled in the sky above.</p><p>Aside from the absence of Heavenly Dao pressure, this scene was no less intimidating than a Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>"Not good!  Let's go!"</p><p>Servant Pei's expression changed. He accelerated, knowing the space here wasn't unified. Breaking out of this space should allow them to escape the danger.</p><p>Even Servant Pei was fleeing, giving a clear indication of the Xin family cultivators' fear.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Countless bolts of lightning crashed down, illuminating the sea surface like daylight, instantly engulfing the group.</p><p>The Jade Ruyi hovered above Servant Pei's head, diverting the surrounding lightning strikes.</p><p>Qin Sang continuously slashed through the lightning with his sword, glancing at the Xin family members from the corner of his eye.</p><p>That treasured bell was more effective against Nascent Soul attacks, and its usefulness here was limited.  Steward Luo hastily summoned a long banner. The group joined forces to empower it.  The banner unfurled, shielding them beneath its canopy.</p><p>Under the constant bombardment of lightning, the banner vibrated continuously, emanating waves of faint light.</p><p>It seemed to block the lightning, but the true danger had just begun.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang and Servant Pei simultaneously looked upwards.</p><p>"Danger!"</p><p>In that instant, they felt a strong premonition of danger, sensing a menacing aura emanating from the dark clouds.</p><p>This aura appeared without warning, and it was potent enough to threaten even Void Refinement cultivators!</p><p>Almost as soon as the warning arose, a bolt of lightning shot down from the dark clouds. Unlike the previous strikes, this one was shaped like a giant crescent moon, slashing down, sweeping across the entire void.</p><p>The attack came too suddenly.  Qin Sang and Servant Pei had no time to evade and could only brace for impact.</p><p>As the saying went, everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep.  Uncertain of the crescent moon lightning's power, their first priority was self-preservation. They didn't immediately move to protect the Xin family members.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly observed Young Master Xin’s actions, intending to use this opportunity to force out a few more of the Xin family's trump cards.  He suspected Servant Pei had the same idea.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The crescent moon lightning struck with astonishing force.</p><p>The group was instantly swallowed by the lightning, surrounded by a blinding white light.  The violent power of thunder surged towards them.</p><p>As the lightning raged, a sword light suddenly erupted, radiating a shocking sword intent, fiercely cleaving through the lightning.  It was Qin Sang, driving the Grey Warbler Sword upwards against the onslaught.</p><p>From his vantage point, Qin Sang saw a ball of azure light emerge from the lightning. Servant Pei, shielded by his Jade Ruyi, also broke free.</p><p>The two exchanged glances, then both looked towards the Xin family members.</p><p>This crescent moon lightning undoubtedly possessed Void Refinement level power.  Even they had to approach it cautiously. If the Xin family failed to respond appropriately, some might perish here.</p><p>However, the ensuing scene greatly surprised both Qin Sang and Servant Pei.</p><p>A hundred-zhang long blade aura, only a step behind them, erupted with an unstoppable momentum, fiercely tearing apart the lightning.</p><p>Following closely behind, Young Master Xin led the Xin family members, emerging unscathed from the chasm created by the blade aura, though their faces still held expressions of shock.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze narrowed, scrutinizing Young Master Xin, his eyes finally settling on her back.  A faint shadow clung tightly to her, seemingly a part of her.</p><p>"So this is the Xin family’s inherited Dark Spirit? I didn't expect you to be able to control it so freely, Xin Sheng.  Truly remarkable talent!"</p><p>Servant Pei recognized the shadow’s origin, showering her with praise.</p><p>No one noticed the flicker of delight in Servant Pei’s eyes.  Forcing Young Master Xin to summon the Dark Spirit here seemed to be precisely what he had hoped for.</p><p>Young Master Xin's face, however, held no trace of self-satisfaction.  Her breathing was slightly ragged, and bloodshot streaks appeared in her jade-like eyes, as if summoning the Dark Spirit had come at a considerable cost.</p><p>Seeing the dark clouds hadn't dispersed, Young Master Xin didn't dare hesitate, hurriedly leading the Xin family members onward.</p><p>…</p><p>As Qin Sang and the others raced across the black sea, they were completely unaware of the changes occurring behind them.</p><p>Outside the tomb, a gentle breeze stirred, and an elderly man materialized out of thin air.</p><p>The elder, with his crane-like white hair and youthful face, looked at the broken ancient restrictions on the stone gate, stroking his white beard with a smug smile.</p><p>"Hmph! Old ghost Pei, you think you and that wet-behind-the-ears Xin family brat can fool me with these petty tricks? You dare treat the Xin family as your personal prize? I'll see what other abilities you possess…"</p><p>His voice trailed off as the elder's figure flickered, slipping through the crack in the stone gate, transforming into a wisp of smoke that followed the tomb passage.</p>
