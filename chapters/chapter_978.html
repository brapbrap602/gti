<h1>Chapter 970: Abandonment</h1><p>Chapter 970: Abandonment</p><p>The cultivators were startled by the celestial barrier, but they didn't notice that the Nine-Phoenix King was leading the demons to a distant escape.</p><p>Flower Fairy Lake.</p><p>“The celestial barrier’s disturbance was significant; I saw someone emerge from the Heavenly Tower just now.  The cultivators will surely launch a thorough investigation into the barrier's anomaly. You should leave with me.”</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King spoke, opening a restriction and entering the cave beneath the hills.</p><p>The demons exchanged glances, raising no objections, and silently followed.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly heard a whispered voice in his ear, his body stiffening slightly, a look of surprise flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Yuan Zhu, appearing calm, passed him by without looking back, entering the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at Yuan Zhu's back, his mind racing, his hand instinctively clenching into a fist as he silently followed.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Silence reigned.</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King sat cross-legged on the altar, her long feather exhausted from her efforts. She had consumed several pills earlier and was now refining their power, recovering her true essence.</p><p>The others could only wait.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in a corner, his gaze occasionally sweeping across the demons, paying particular attention to Yuan Zhu. But Yuan Zhu kept his eyes closed, seemingly also meditating, ignoring Qin Sang.</p><p>Half an hour later, the Nine-Phoenix King awoke from her meditative state, slowly opening her eyes, a flash of brilliance quickly fading.</p><p>Seeing this, the demons all stood up and moved to the edge of the altar.</p><p>“Caiyi, bring out the other array component. I need to modify the formation. Though I have the Sky Phoenix Feather, taking all of you out is still somewhat strenuous. Fortunately, your cultivations are not high, so the pressure will be much less…”</p><p>Cai Feng Xianzi was surprised, “Nineth Aunt, the feather used to penetrate the celestial barrier—wasn't that the Sky Phoenix Feather?”</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King chuckled, “The Sky Phoenix Feather is a treasure of our clan, but its origin is inferior to that feather. It's insufficient to break the Qisha Palace's celestial barrier.”</p><p>At this point, the Nine-Phoenix King suddenly stopped speaking, withholding any explanation of the feather's origin.</p><p>After the Nine-Phoenix King obtained the spiritual object, and after a dazzling array of preparations, the formation’s range expanded by half, and the runes on the altar became far more intricate.</p><p>“Activate the array!”</p><p>At the Nine-Phoenix King's command, the demons pressed their palms against the altar.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Nine-Phoenix King opened her palm, revealing an extraordinarily beautiful phoenix feather.</p><p>Unlike the previously damaged feather, this feather's colors were vibrant and extremely light, feeling almost weightless in the Nine-Phoenix King's hand.</p><p>‘Buzz!’</p><p>The altar trembled, the runes glowing brightly.</p><p>The formation's power was unleashed.  The Nine-Phoenix King stood in the center of the formation, raising her arm, her true essence surging. She lightly swept the feather in front of her; the feather burst forth with a seven-colored light.</p><p>The demons heard the Nine-Phoenix King's mental transmission and stepped onto the altar.  They then felt their bodies tighten, enveloped by the feather's light. After a bout of dizziness, a deafening roar suddenly filled their ears.</p><p>Opening their eyes, they found themselves outside Qisha Palace, amidst a raging storm.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gray storm swept toward them.</p><p>The demons hastily dodged, avoiding the storm's main force.</p><p>Their eyes still held a lingering shock as they looked around; they were surrounded by an endless expanse of storm, unable to see the celestial array or determine their direction.</p><p>They hurriedly took jade talismans from their pouches. Seeing the talismans glow brightly, they realized they were very close to Qisha Palace—the Sky Phoenix Feather had only moved them a short distance.</p><p>Even so, it was astonishing enough. The Sky Phoenix Feather truly had transported them out of Qisha Palace.  From the Nine-Phoenix King's tone, the damaged feather seemed to be of even greater origin than the Sky Phoenix Feather; it was unknown what treasure it was.</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King stood on a wave crest, her face pale, clearly indicating that activating the Sky Phoenix Feather was not easy.</p><p>She sent several beams of light towards the Sky Phoenix Feather, sealing the treasure.</p><p>“Let's go. Qisha Palace is about to close; don't let Yuan Ying stage cultivators encounter us.”</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King's figure flashed, about to dart out of the storm.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yuan Zhu suddenly called out to the Nine-Phoenix King, “Senior Nine-Phoenix King, the clan's task entrusted to us is complete. Can we leave now?”</p><p>“Leave?”</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King turned to look, “Where do you want to go? I need people to assist me, and you must remain by my side for a while. During this time, you shall only obey my orders.”</p><p>The demons exchanged glances. Yuan Zhu showed no fear in the face of the Nine-Phoenix King's gaze, calmly replying.</p><p>“The clan promised us that upon completing our task, they would lift the secret technique and restore our original forms. We intended to return to the Demon Sea together.</p><p>“Since Senior has given her orders, we will naturally obey.”</p><p>However, since becoming human, we've wandered Canglang Sea for nearly a century without any progress in cultivation.  If this continues, even with the promised reward from our clan, the chance of transformation will be extremely slim.</p><p>"Senior, perhaps you could release the secret technique on us. When you need us, you can reactivate it.  This way, it won't delay your important affairs, and we can also cultivate, achieving two goals at once."</p><p>King Jiu Feng coldly retorted, "Do you think this secret technique is so easily released and reactivated? Once my grand plan is complete, I will naturally send you back..."</p><p>"Is it really just difficult to release?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu suddenly revealed a ferocious expression, shouting to interrupt King Jiu Feng, "Senior, dare you swear on your inner demon, is it truly difficult to release, or is it impossible? We...have already been treated as expendable pawns, haven't we?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu's desperate accusation was earth-shattering.</p><p>The statement caused an uproar amongst the assembled demons.</p><p>Qin Sang, standing at the periphery, witnessed this scene with a changing expression, her gaze shifting between King Jiu Feng and Yuan Zhu.</p><p>King Jiu Feng's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Yuan Zhu's eyes held despair, a wry smile playing on his lips as he turned to the Caiyi Fairy, saying hoarsely, "Gu Heng, Caiyi Fairy, don't you believe it?"</p><p>"Ninth Aunt..."</p><p>Caiyi Fairy's lips were pale, tears streaming down her face as she stared incredulously at King Jiu Feng, "He's telling the truth. We truly are...expendable pawns to the clan?"</p><p>Facing this familiar junior, King Jiu Feng opened his mouth, no longer bothering to conceal anything, only letting out a soft sigh, leaving everything unspoken.</p><p>At this, the faces of the other demons turned ashen, their despair complete.</p><p>They never imagined that their diligent service to the Demon King would be repaid not with reward, but with abandonment.  No, from the very beginning of the plan, they had been expendable; the promised reward was merely to quell their suspicions.</p><p>This wasn't a conspiracy limited to a single clan, but a plot encompassing the entire demon race.</p><p>They came from the top clans of the Demon Sea, many being favored sons or close confidants of Demon Kings, all with the potential for transformation.  Who could have imagined that the demon race would abandon these promising juniors?</p><p>"Attack now! Do you think she'll spare our lives?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu roared.</p><p>Having uncovered the Demon King's long-hidden secret, King Jiu Feng could not possibly let them live.  If word reached the Demon race, it would inevitably cause chaos.</p>
