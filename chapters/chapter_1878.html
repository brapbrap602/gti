<h1>Chapter 1869: The Great Sage</h1><p>A fiery star fell from the heavens.</p><p>A scorching wind roared, warping the very fabric of space.</p><p>With a whispered incantation, the old Daoist abruptly flung his whisk.  The whisk, now a sword, pointed diagonally towards the sky.</p><p>The golden light within the battle formation was drawn to the whisk, surging in golden waves.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The whisk’s filaments burst apart, yet remained unruffled, forming an incredibly complex rune of thousands of silver threads. Golden light frantically converged at the whisk’s tip.</p><p>A golden talisman condensed in front of the whisk. The talisman, radiant gold, was as thin as a cicada's wing, light as water.</p><p>Nearly ten zhang long, it resembled a golden banner standing in the void.  The banner bore no characters, only intricate golden runes far more complex than any the old Daoist had used before.</p><p>As golden light flowed, the talisman rose, seemingly slow yet swift, meeting the falling meteorite. In a flash, it appeared before the celestial body.</p><p>The meteorite was immense, its surrounding flames forming an even larger fireball. Compared to it, the talisman appeared minuscule, insignificant.</p><p>But the instant it touched the talisman, the meteorite’s momentum halted, its speed plummeting.</p><p>Time seemed to freeze. The fireball struck an unyielding barrier, its leading edge deeply indented.</p><p>The talisman plunged into the fireball. Seemingly fragile, it forced back the fiery flames.</p><p>Amid the chaotic fire, the talisman’s light shone brilliantly, piercing through layers of intense heat, finally penetrating the fireball and imprinting itself upon the meteorite within.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The meteorite violently shuddered.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Streams of red-hot fire, losing control, erupted from the fireball, shooting in all directions.</p><p>The talisman adhered to the meteorite's surface.  Though seemingly a small imprint, light and airy, it possessed immense power, causing the gigantic meteorite to tremble violently, suspended in mid-air.</p><p>Then, the talisman exploded with even more intense golden light.  The light, like blades, stirred the fiery storm, penetrating the meteorite's interior.</p><p>*Crack! Crack!*</p><p>The meteorite shook violently, fissures appearing, crisscrossing from the talisman as their center, forming larger cracks spreading outwards.</p><p>The meteorite’s surface was a network of ravines and holes.</p><p>The next moment, the other side of the meteorite was also torn apart, with golden light seeping out.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the meteorite was pierced by the talisman's power, from the inside out, filled with golden light.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A deafening roar shook the battlefield.</p><p>Blazing golden light erupted, blindingly bright.  Fragments of the meteorite, trailing flames, shot out like fireworks—a breathtaking spectacle, yet accompanied by an astonishing surge of energy.</p><p>The meteorite had been torn apart by a single golden talisman!</p><p>Observers were astounded; the demon cultivators were horrified; the human cultivators were ecstatic.</p><p>Two demon king phantoms groaned, recoiling several zhang, their figures disheveled, their breaths ragged.</p><p>The meteorite, summoned from the outer realms by their phantoms’ power, was linked to their essence. Its destruction inevitably resulted in a backlash.</p><p>The Earth Armored Dragon restlessly swished its tail; the Fire Spirit intently stared at the fragments of the Twenty-Four Heavens Prison Chart.</p><p>This damaged treasure was far from comparable to the legendary Heavens Prison.  The ghost soldiers and talisman gods’ power was limited.  Previously, with the presence of Grand Masters and demon kings on the battlefield, they hadn't realized the Yin Tian Palace's true might.  Only now, having witnessed its power, did they understand.</p><p>The meteorite shattered; the demon kings were thwarted.</p><p>The Daoist forces gained momentum.  Following his talisman strike, the old Daoist pointed his whisk forward.</p><p>Three Grand Masters, having already prepared their altars, surpassed the old Daoist, leading other Masters and soldiers in a shift of formation. Dividing into three groups, with the three Grand Masters at their heads, they charged toward the enemy.  The attack was relentless and unstoppable.</p><p>The old Daoist remained at the heart of the battle formation, employing finger techniques, step-based tactics, talismans, summoning divine generals…</p><p>His mastery of celestial arts was unparalleled. Relying on the fragments of the chart, his various abilities were dazzling.</p><p>At this moment, three sharp peaks emerged at the front of the golden battle formation, like three golden arrows, advancing simultaneously, led by the three Grand Masters.</p><p>On the other side, the Ghost Kingdom’s forces, their morale crushed by the shattered meteorite, appeared to be paralyzed by the power of the Twenty-Four Heavens Prison Chart.  They were slow to react, leading to chaos and disunity—a scattered army.</p><p>One demon king phantom, with the body of a scorpion and a lion's head, retreated, only to be met by a wave of green mist.</p><p>The mist, containing deadly poison, was the scorpion-lion's unique ability.</p><p>During the previous clash, he secretly released poison, but before it could take effect, the old Daoist priest repelled it with a sweep of his whisk.</p><p>Facing his own poisonous mist, the Scorpion-tailed Lion didn't dare to engage directly, for the mist was imbued with the power of the talismans.</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The Scorpion-tailed Lion lashed out, emitting beams of divine light to disperse the mist.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded repeatedly within the demon array.</p><p>As the tide turned, the demon array fell into disarray.  The Daoist forces pressed their advantage, poised to break through the enemy lines and charge into the auspicious clouds.</p><p>At this juncture, the White-robed Demon King finally acted.  He seemed to only now perceive the shift in the battle behind him, slowly turning around.</p><p>The battlefield came into view, yet his expression remained unchanged, his gaze indifferent.</p><p>Glancing casually at the old Daoist and others, the White-robed Demon King tilted his head slightly, murmuring a seemingly wistful sigh:  "Twenty-four hells of imprisonment..."</p><p>Instead of panic, a strange and unsettling expression appeared on his face.</p><p>The hearts of the Daoists leaped; an inexplicable unease washed over them, though they couldn't pinpoint its source.</p><p>The demon array's momentum had been extinguished, and any attempt to regroup was too late.  The Demon Kings' actions seemed genuine, revealing no signs of a trap.</p><p>Nor did the White-robed Demon King exhibit any unusual fluctuations.</p><p>All signs pointed to a Daoist victory, yet the unsettling feeling intensified.</p><p>Suddenly, a mocking smile touched the White-robed Demon King's lips. He gestured behind him.</p><p>The tremors within the auspicious clouds ceased abruptly.</p><p>The swirling vortex of multicolored clouds suddenly stopped rotating, the clouds dissipating. A beam of light shot from the vortex into the White-robed Demon King's hand – the half-edict.</p><p>The passage to the Divine Court vanished.</p><p>Clutching the edict, the White-robed Demon King's gaze swept coldly across the battlefield before he crushed it.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The sound, though not loud, echoed like thunder in the Daoists' ears, sending a jolt through their minds.</p><p>The old Daoist priest hurriedly looked at the other half of the edict floating beside him, discovering it was also covered in cracks.</p><p>Simultaneously, four figures flew from the demon array: three demon king forms, including Earth Armor Dragon, and a seemingly unremarkable young man.  Despite possessing only a Demon Marquis cultivation, this youth was shielded by the three Demon Kings.</p><p>The young man, his face etched with anxiety, flew to the White-robed Demon King's side, producing a gray cloth sack.  After unsealing it, a purple light shot out, landing before the Demon King.</p><p>"Your subordinate has succeeded," the youth said, breathing a sigh of relief before bowing and retreating, his expression filled with excitement.</p><p>The purple light coalesced into a large purple drum, lacking drumsticks but adorned with golden threads depicting strange beasts.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A tiger's roar echoed suddenly.</p><p>For the first time, the White-robed Demon King manifested his true form: a ferocious white tiger, which leaped into his body. He raised his right hand, a purple mark appearing in his palm.  Purple light surged towards it, forming a purple drumstick.</p><p>The drumstick pulsed with purple electricity, radiating otherworldly power.</p><p>After creating the drumstick, the White-robed Demon King's face turned pale, a sign of immense exertion.</p><p>"Sound the Demon Drum!"</p><p>Upon seeing the purple drum, the old Daoist's face completely changed.</p><p>The three Grand Masters and other experienced Daoists were also shocked, uttering cries of alarm.</p><p>The Demon Drum was the greatest treasure of Guifang, bar none.  Even divine treasures and innate spiritual treasures paled in comparison in the eyes of Guifang's cultivators.</p><p>Guifang's very existence was largely attributed to this treasure.</p><p>None present had witnessed the Demon Drum's power firsthand, but all knew its legend.</p><p>It was said that once struck, its sound would spread instantly for thousands of miles. Reaching the Blight Origin, the ferocious beasts and ghosts within would be driven mad, drawn to the drum's call.</p><p>The drum's sound supposedly could attract beasts and ghosts comparable to Great Saints, or even more terrifying beings!</p><p>The Blight Origin, a boundless expanse of land and sea, was far more dangerous than imagined.</p><p>These beasts and ghosts instinctively repelled the fluctuations of Daoist seals; the stronger they were, the more acute their perception.  Unless provoked, they generally wouldn't approach.  But if driven mad by the drum's sound and they charge into the Four Provinces, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>Fortunately, Guifang couldn't fully control these beasts and ghosts.</p><p>The Great Sage’s intervention, even with the magical drum, carries the risk of backlash.  Should that happen, before the enemy is vanquished, Guifang might be overrun by the beasts, making it a disastrous gamble.  Therefore, the magical drum is rarely used.</p><p>However, when Guifang faces utter annihilation, it will inevitably summon the beasts, destroying the four territories and perishing with the Daoist sect.</p><p>The magical drum serves as a powerful deterrent, preventing the Daoist sect from pushing Guifang to such extremes.</p><p>Because of this, the Daoist sect in this realm controls two territories, and for years has held superior power over Guifang. Yet, even at its peak, it has never succeeded in destroying Guifang.</p><p>The magical drum is a national treasure, carefully guarded within the Great Sage’s palace.</p><p>Losing this artifact would place Guifang’s fate entirely in the hands of the Daoist sect.</p><p>And yet, they dared to bring it into the Vile Mire!</p><p>The White-robed Demon King, face contorted, raised his drumsticks high and brought them down with a mighty blow.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The drumsticks vanished from the White-robed Demon King’s hands, seemingly depleted of all their power.  Sweat poured from his face, his body trembled, revealing his profound weakness.</p><p>A dense purple light erupted from the drumhead, stinging the eyes of all present.</p><p>The drum’s sound echoed far and wide.</p><p>It reached the battlefield, piercing through layers of illusions, and was heard by Qin Sang,  Zuo Zhenren, and others within the altar.</p><p>The Grand Masters and Demon Kings outside the altar also heard it.</p><p>These events unfolded nearly simultaneously. The drum’s reverberations spread across the Vile Mire, instantly covering tens of thousands of miles, reaching its deepest recesses.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>Another Demon King took over from the White-robed one, striking the drum a second time, then a third…</p><p>…</p><p>On a towering mountain range…</p><p>The mountain, seemingly made of black iron, its dark stone surface devoid of vegetation or beasts.</p><p>Its steep slopes soared towards the heavens. Approaching it brought an overwhelming sense of oppression.</p><p>The immense pressure instilled a primal fear, repelling any beast from drawing near.</p><p>Atop the mountain was a large platform, its center sunken.</p><p>Suddenly, a shrill cry pierced the air, filled with boundless rage.  Chaos erupted outside the mountain, countless beasts scattering in terror.</p><p>“Li!”</p><p>The piercing shriek echoed through the heavens, even overpowering the drum’s sound.</p><p>The next moment, the entire mountain range was enveloped by a massive shadow.  In the sky, only a pair of immense black wings were visible, blotting out the sun, like a descending cloud.</p><p>…</p><p>Simultaneously, in another part of the Vile Mire’s depths, an endless plain…</p><p>When the drum’s sound arrived, a cataclysmic explosion tore through the middle of the plain.</p><p>Waves of earth surged tens of thousands of feet into the air.  A bottomless chasm had opened in the plain.</p><p>Raging roars shook the heavens.</p><p>No beast was visible, but a grey thunderbolt shot from the chasm, shattering the void.</p><p>Where the thunderbolt passed, it left twisting trails of lightning in its wake.  Countless bolts filled the sky, painting a terrifying picture of thunder and lightning, as if tearing the heavens apart.</p><p>Occasionally, a stray arc struck the ground, effortlessly obliterating mountains and everything within them.</p><p>…</p><p>The shrill cries and roars shook the Vile Mire, reaching the armies outside the altar.</p><p>Cultivators looked towards the depths of the Vile Mire.  In their sight, the auspicious clouds above the altar glowed even brighter, like a rainbow.</p><p>Behind the auspicious clouds lay the dark sky, where beings that instilled terror resided.</p><p>Even the Grand Masters and Demon Kings felt their hearts tremble upon hearing the sounds, sensing the horrifying murderous aura, all were aghast.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the altar…</p><p>Qin Sang remained clueless about the magical drum and the meaning of the sounds.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren clearly had no time for explanations.</p><p>However, seeing Zuo Zhenren’s expression, Qin Sang understood that something terrible had befallen the Daoist sect.</p><p>After the three drumbeats, Qin Sang frowned slightly. He faintly heard shrill cries and roars.</p><p>The sounds, though faint, originated from outside the altar, sending chills down his spine. Something terrifying seemed to be approaching.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren abruptly raised his head, his expression even more enraged, confirming Qin Sang’s intuition.</p><p>…</p><p>Deep within the altar…</p><p>The Daoist sect fought desperately, but couldn’t stop the Demon Kings from striking the magical drum.</p><p>The pale scholar, his face weak, yet stared at the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons fragment map with greedy eyes.</p><p>At that moment, the astute Masters realized something.</p><p>There was no divine court emerging!</p><p>It was all a fabrication, a trap laid by Guifang.  They exploited the unusual altar disturbance, laying their plans for a hundred years, step by step luring the Daoist sect into this, all for this day!</p><p>So, what was Guifang’s goal?</p><p>The old Daoist priest abruptly looked up.</p><p>The Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons fragment map!</p><p>Guifang wanted to seize the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons fragment map!</p><p>Long ago, the Hou Tu Celestial Master created the Divine Path, forging the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons.  This artifact was the origin of the Divine Path.</p><p>If Guifang truly intended to revive the Divine Path, using the fragment map would be of immense significance.</p><p>However, this treasure was always hidden in Crane Song Mountain, protected by the Yin Heaven Palace's grand formation, with the Daoist Court capable of immediate support – not easily taken.</p><p>Once the map leaves the Yin Heaven Palace, particularly if brought into the Vile Mire, it would be much easier to seize. Striking the magical drum here would also lessen their concerns.</p><p>The old Daoist instantly understood, his hand trembling on his whisk.  He desperately tried to retrieve the map.</p><p>…</p><p>At the border of the Vile Mire and Mount Gang.</p><p>When the imperial decree was crushed, the wind and clouds here surged.</p><p>Dark clouds covered the sun, rapidly spreading towards the Mount Gang altar, instantly crossing the vast Vile Mire.  Golden light like scales was faintly visible within the clouds.</p><p>The armies outside the altar suddenly felt the world darken, looking up to find the eastern sky shrouded in thunderclouds, wind and thunder accompanying their approach.</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
