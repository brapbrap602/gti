<h1>Chapter 1565: Deer Wilds</h1><p>Shuo County.</p><p>Located in the northern part of Zhuozhou, bordering Zhaoyaozhou, the county is characterized by vast stretches of water interspersed with occasional mountains.</p><p>The Wen Clan of Shuo County, whose strongest member was only at the Golden Core realm, held a position of prominence within the county, commanding respect from all surrounding powers.</p><p>This was solely due to the fact that the Wen Clan had once produced an elder of Mount Bu Nian.</p><p>Although that ancestor had long since ascended, and the Wen Clan's glory had faded with the passage of time, a thread of connection with Mount Bu Nian still remained.</p><p>Upon receiving the Wen Clan's plea for help, Mount Bu Nian treated the matter with utmost seriousness. An elder had already been dispatched, and fearing that the rescue might be too late, they immediately sent a message to Mount Pu, requesting Qin Sang's assistance.</p><p>Daring to infiltrate Zhuozhou and target the Wen Clan, these villains had reached a point of audacious recklessness, a clear indication of the growing chaos within the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Xie An to seal Mount Pu, then flew out, his escape light streaking directly towards Shuo County.</p><p>…</p><p>The Wen Clan held sole dominion over a vast marshland.</p><p>Thanks to their ancestor's legacy, the Wen Clan's cultivation grounds possessed exceptional feng shui. Known as Wen Clan Island, it was a place of scenic beauty, a veritable paradise on earth. The island's protective formation, personally established by their ancestor, was far superior to those of ordinary clans and sects.</p><p>At this moment, however, spectral figures roamed freely across Wen Clan Island's main island, accompanied by incessant screams.</p><p>The island's protective formation had been breached.</p><p>The current state of Wen Clan Island bore no resemblance to a celestial paradise. Most of the buildings had collapsed, the stench of blood hung heavy in the air, and corpses littered the ground, including not only cultivators but also ordinary mortals.</p><p>Innumerable lives had been lost, with barely a single intact body to be found. The scene was truly horrific.</p><p>At the center of Wen Clan Island, a faint, hemispherical, cyan light barrier could be seen.</p><p>This was the only area that had not yet fallen to the enemy. The surviving members of the Wen Clan huddled within, their sole protection being this thin layer of light. Fear and uncertainty etched on every face, the more timid among them had already broken down in tears.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>…</p><p>The light barrier trembled with increasing violence.</p><p>From outside came bursts of maniacal laughter, each one sending shivers down the spines of the Wen Clan members, who desperately prayed that the experts from Mount Bu Nian would arrive before the barrier shattered.</p><p>A group of figures surrounded the light barrier, each clad in black robes and wearing ghost-faced masks, artifacts specifically crafted to conceal their identities.</p><p>Assailing the light barrier were blood swords and severed heads, clear hallmarks of demonic cultivation practices.</p><p>While the Central Plains had its share of demonic sects, some even rivaling Mount Bu Nian in strength, they differed from the demonic sects of the Northern Wastelands. These sects were known for their extreme brutality, shunned by the powers of the Central Plains and driven into the Northern Wastelands long ago.</p><p>The Wen Clan resisted with all their might.</p><p>The attackers, however, found their progress impeded.</p><p>A figure who appeared to be the leader glanced at the sky, then lowered his voice, “Retreat!”</p><p>With that, he withdrew his blood sword without hesitation and turned to leave. Several of his companions followed suit, retrieving their magical artifacts and departing alongside him.</p><p>The remaining attackers were not pleased.</p><p>“We’re about to break the formation! The Wen Clan had a Nascent Soul ancestor, they must have left behind plenty of treasures. We agreed to divide the spoils equally!  Surnamed Wang, you’re abandoning us mid-battle, how do you expect us to react?!”</p><p>Someone shouted angrily.</p><p>The leader didn’t turn back, chuckling coldly. “I did indeed desire the Nascent Soul’s treasures, but I’ve changed my mind. If you acquire the treasures, I assure you I won’t take a single one, and I'll offer my congratulations. But if you all die here, don't blame anyone on your journey to the underworld… Do as you please!”</p><p>These words prompted a torrent of curses from the remaining attackers.</p><p>They had tricked their way through the Wen Clan Island's outer protective formation, but unexpectedly, there was an inner spiritual formation as well. Despite their prolonged assault, they had yet to breach it.</p><p>Without their leader and his companions, even if they managed to break through the inner formation, Mount Bu Nian's Nascent Soul cultivators would likely have arrived by then, leaving them no chance to enjoy their spoils.</p><p>Left with no choice, the remaining attackers withdrew.</p><p>They flew north, scattering like birds and beasts after leaving Wen Clan Island.</p><p>The Wen Clan, having narrowly escaped annihilation, were still reeling from the shock. As they gazed upon the devastation around them, grief overwhelmed them. Some, upon seeing the corpses of their loved ones, wept inconsolably, attempting to rush out, only to be stopped by the clan leader.</p><p>A moment later, a streak of escape light appeared on the horizon, swift as lightning, arriving above Wen Clan Island in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Seeing an unfamiliar face, the Wen Clan leader’s expression shifted, and he swallowed the words on the tip of his tongue.</p><p>“Are you Wen Qi, the Wen Clan leader? I am Qing Feng of Mount Pu. I received a message sword from Mount Bu Nian and came to assist.”</p><p>The newcomer was Qin Sang.</p><p>He had set off immediately upon receiving the news, yet he was still a step too late. He hadn’t expected the Wen Clan Island’s protective formation to be breached so quickly. The island was in ruins, and the enemies had fled swiftly, leaving no trace behind.</p><p>Fortunately, the Wen Clan had not been completely eradicated; at least the core of the clan had survived.</p><p>“Senior is Daoist Qing Feng of Mount Pu?”</p><p>Upon learning Qin Sang's identity, Wen Qi dared to step out of the spiritual formation. He fell to his knees amidst the corpses, his robes stained with blood, and wailed in anguish, “Senior, please avenge the Wen Clan!”</p><p>Qin Sang offered no immediate response, instead surveying the surroundings. “Do you know who attacked Wen Clan Island? In which direction did they flee?”</p><p>Wen Qi pointed north, his voice filled with hatred. “The Wen Clan disciples are cautious and avoid making enemies. Those individuals were demonic cultivators from the Northern Wastelands, cruel and ruthless. They must have coveted the magical treasures left behind by our ancestor. To seize these treasures, they were willing to annihilate my entire clan!”</p><p>Wen Qi's account aligned with Mount Bu Nian’s assessment.</p><p>Descendants of Nascent Soul cultivators generally possessed considerable wealth, enough to tempt unscrupulous individuals to take risks.</p><p>However, after scanning the area, Qin Sang noticed something amiss. He countered, “Were those demonic cultivators preoccupied with looting and killing as soon as they landed on Wen Clan Island?”</p><p>Wen Qi paused, then nodded.</p><p>He was no fool. Upon hearing Qin Sang’s question, he immediately understood the implication.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes.</p><p>Compared to other forces, the Wen Clan was indeed wealthy, and the attackers could undoubtedly have amassed a considerable haul.</p><p>But these were ordinary treasures, which could be obtained through several raids elsewhere. Why risk infiltrating Zhuozhou and offending Mount Bu Nian?</p><p>Wen Qi repeatedly claimed that the attackers coveted his ancestor’s treasures, but the evidence on the island suggested otherwise. It appeared as though the attackers had deliberately given the Wen Clan a chance to escape, allowing the clan leader time to activate the inner formation and call for help.</p><p>If their true target was the reinforcements, then they were likely targeting Mount Bu Nian!</p><p>This kind of tactic was something Qin Sang himself had employed countless times.</p><p>Simple, yet effective!</p><p>A glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. The attackers certainly wouldn’t have anticipated that Mount Bu Nian would request his assistance.</p><p>He hadn’t been ambushed on his way here, but the elder from Mount Bu Nian might not be so fortunate!</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Cheng Weizi will be arriving soon. Return inside, and no one is to leave the spiritual formation for now!”</p><p>Leaving these instructions, Qin Sang didn’t pursue the demonic cultivators. Instead, he turned and flew southeast.</p><p>The scenery of Shuo County was no less breathtaking than that of Zezhou.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, had no mind for sightseeing, preoccupied with weighing the pros and cons of the situation.</p><p>He had a bond of camaraderie with Lu Zhang and a good relationship with Mount Bu Nian. If their elder was in danger, he was obligated to help. However, he didn't know which force was targeting Mount Bu Nian, nor their objective.</p><p>If the opponent was too powerful, he would have to bide his time and act strategically.</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his escape light, concealing his presence, exercising caution.</p><p>After a short while, a meteor-like escape light streaked across the sky, heading directly towards him. Qin Sang discreetly grasped his spiritual treasure, focusing his gaze. The approaching figure was indeed Cheng Weizi of Mount Bu Nian.</p><p>Cheng Weizi’s aura was strong and steady, showing no signs of having been attacked.</p><p>“Could I have been overthinking it?”</p><p>Qin Sang wondered as he revealed himself.</p><p>At the same time, Cheng Weizi’s voice, tinged with surprise, echoed from within the escape light.</p><p>“Daoist Qing Feng?”</p><p>The escape light flickered, and Cheng Weizi landed before Qin Sang. “Daoist, are you coming from Wen Clan Island? Did you eliminate the demonic cultivators who attacked the Wen Clan?”</p><p>Qin Sang observed Cheng Weizi, shaking his head. “By the time I arrived at Wen Clan Island, those demonic cultivators had already escaped…”</p><p>He recounted his observations and suspicions, explaining, “I suspected a deeper plot and worried that Fellow Daoist might be ambushed, so I came to meet you. It seems I was overthinking it. Unfortunately, with this delay, it will be difficult to apprehend those demonic cultivators…”</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang noticed a change in Cheng Weizi’s expression.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Cheng Weizi seemed to have remembered something. He abruptly turned his escape light, and without time for a detailed explanation, soared through the air.</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned, then quickly followed, flying alongside Cheng Weizi.</p><p>Cheng Weizi cupped his hands towards Qin Sang, expressing his gratitude.</p><p>However, he wasn’t flying back towards Mount Bu Nian. Instead, he headed towards a renowned mountain range in Zhuozhou—Great Scarlet Mountain.</p><p>Great Scarlet Mountain was famous for its vastness and grandeur, second only to Mount Zhaoyao in the four northern provinces.</p><p>Although the spiritual energy within the mountain was somewhat thin and it lacked secret realms, it boasted numerous caves, attracting many rogue cultivators and smaller sects who sought refuge under the protection of Mount Bu Nian.</p><p>After entering Great Scarlet Mountain, they flew past dozens of peaks before Cheng Weizi abruptly changed direction, descending into a secluded valley. Qin Sang followed, only to find a scene of utter devastation.</p><p>Several figures lay sprawled on the ground, blood pooling beneath them, lifeless.</p><p>Clearly, a spiritual formation had previously concealed the entire valley.</p><p>Now, the formation was broken, the remnants still fresh.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang noticed traces of a battle between Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Both parties had vanished, their fates unknown, as were any spoils taken.</p><p>Cheng Weizi’s face was etched with bitterness. “To be honest with Daoist, there was a Heavenly Spirit Tree here, a rare Red Jujube tree. Consuming a single Red Jujube every thirty years provides considerable benefits, even to Nascent Soul cultivators. The Red Jujube Spirit Tree was the treasured possession of the Long Wind Sect. Every time it bore fruit, we would exchange a portion with them…”</p><p>As he spoke, Cheng Weizi swiftly moved towards the depths of the valley, arriving at a clear spring.</p><p>Beside the spring was a large pit where the spirit tree had been uprooted.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, inquiring, “Is the Long Wind Sect’s leader also a Nascent Soul cultivator, Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>Cheng Weizi nodded. “His cultivation is comparable to mine. There are several of our sect’s cultivation grounds within Great Scarlet Mountain, often used by our elders. Currently, only my senior brother Cheng Shenzi and I are here.”</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed. So, after all this maneuvering, their true target was the Long Wind Sect’s spirit tree. The attack on Wen Clan Island was a diversion to draw Cheng Weizi away.</p><p>The loss of the spirit tree was a foregone conclusion, and the fate of the Long Wind Sect’s leader remained uncertain.</p><p>Neither of them dared to delay.</p><p>After sending a message back to his sect, Cheng Weizi followed the trail.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Cheng Shenzi wasn’t at his cave at the time?” Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>Cheng Shenzi’s strength was said to surpass even Lu Zhang’s, making him Mount Bu Nian’s second most powerful cultivator, second only to their sect leader. However, a past injury had left him with lingering ailments, hindering his potential and stagnating his cultivation for many years.</p><p>With Cheng Shenzi guarding Great Scarlet Mountain, the attackers shouldn’t have been able to succeed so easily.</p><p>With the situation as it was, Cheng Weizi no longer concealed anything. “Daoist likely hasn’t heard the news yet. A few days ago, a message arrived from the East Sea, reporting unusual phenomena near the Red South Island chain, possibly indicating the emergence of the Unfettered Palace’s ruins. What’s more, Nascent Soul cultivators from the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery have been sighted nearby, and in considerable numbers. The sect leader and my senior brother went to the East Sea together. I didn’t expect trouble to arise so soon after their departure.”</p><p>The Red South Island chain!</p><p>The Unfettered Palace!</p><p>Qin Sang certainly hadn’t forgotten the turmoil of thirty years ago.</p><p>He had been directly involved, though he had withdrawn voluntarily and was unaware of the subsequent developments.</p><p>He hadn’t expected the brewing conflict to finally erupt now.</p><p>“Are you certain it’s the Unfettered Palace?” Qin Sang quickly asked.</p><p>Cheng Weizi shook his head, his mind elsewhere. “They’ve reportedly pinpointed the location and should have news soon.”</p><p>Suspicion flickered in his eyes. “The sect leader and my senior brother left for the East Sea less than three days ago, and they did so discreetly. How did these demonic cultivators know?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression shifted slightly, but he kept his thoughts to himself.</p><p>There were only two possibilities.</p><p>Either the demonic cultivators had received prior information and were closely monitoring Cheng Shenzi’s cave, striking the moment he left Great Scarlet Mountain.</p><p>Or… there was a traitor within Mount Bu Nian.</p><p>Cheng Weizi had clearly considered this as well, his expression darkening.</p><p>As they spoke, they pursued the trail beyond Great Scarlet Mountain.</p><p>The traces became increasingly faint.</p><p>After an indeterminate distance, they finally located the Long Wind Sect’s leader.</p><p>He sat meditating on a mountaintop, his robes wrinkled, his figure appearing somewhat desolate. Upon seeing Cheng Weizi, he could only offer a wry smile.</p><p>After exchanging information, they learned that only a single person had stolen the spirit tree.</p><p>“Did Fellow Daoist recognize his identity?”</p><p>Cheng Weizi’s voice was heavy.  Excluding Lu Zhang’s recent injury, Mount Bu Nian hadn’t suffered such a significant loss in a long time.</p><p>The Long Wind Sect leader hesitated. “Although that fiend tried to conceal his identity, he revealed some clues while defending against my Wind Piercing Strike. However, I've only seen it in ancient texts, and I'm not sure if I'm mistaken… It closely resembled the legendary Dragon Slaying Demonic Force!”</p><p>“Old Demon Lu’s Dragon Slaying Demonic Force?”</p><p>Cheng Weizi exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted. He didn't know what the Dragon Slaying Demonic Force was, but he knew that the Old Demon Lu mentioned by Cheng Weizi was a current Devil Dao cultivator at the Deity Transformation stage.</p><p>This fiend’s domain, known as Deer Wilds, was located in the Northern Wastelands, and Old Demon Lu’s title was derived from it.</p><p>This was because no one knew his true name.</p><p>He was an incredibly enigmatic figure, having disappeared even earlier than True Monarch Dan Yu and Saint Hui Guang, vanishing from the world hundreds of years ago, sealing off the Deer Wilds plains and retreating into seclusion.</p><p>Over the years, many had claimed to be Old Demon Lu’s disciples, but all had proven to be impostors.</p><p>Rumors circulated that he had ascended, while others speculated that he had been eliminated by a joint effort of Buddhist and Daoist cultivators.</p><p>“Is Deer Wilds also about to emerge?”</p><p>Qin Sang wondered inwardly.</p><p>The emergence of the Unfettered Palace’s ruins, the renewed activity of the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, the lurking Gu God Sect in the two southern barbarian provinces, and now the suspected reemergence of Deer Wilds in the Northern Wastelands – the unfolding events were becoming increasingly difficult to decipher.</p><p>After discussing the matter, Cheng Weizi and the Long Wind Sect leader decided to continue their search, hoping to uncover further clues.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly felt a surge of inspiration.  A look of intense joy flashed in his eyes. He quickly excused himself and hurried back to Mount Pu.</p>
