<h1>Chapter 2115: True Thunder Rune Inscription</h1><p>The standing man also withdrew his gaze from the chessboard, turned his head, and echoed, "This shows how much Patriarch Yuanxiang values those foreigners. The plan has succeeded!" The chess-playing man, however, felt doubtful. He looked at the white-robed man opposite the chessboard. "They are nothing more than insignificant foreigners. Even if Patriarch Yuanxiang fails to protect them, leading to their annihilation, can it truly create a rift between the Zhuyan Clan and *that side*? Uncle said *that side* is a foreign power, but I don't know why they gained the Mirage Pavilion's favor.  Since they are foreigners, if they want to achieve anything in the Sacred Lands, they won't easily abandon the Zhuyan Clan, their ally."  "A river freezes three feet deep, not in a single day's cold! If this plan fails, there will be a next time. Over time, a gap will surely form! With one less ally, the Zhuyan Clan's power will weaken, and our clan's chances will increase." The standing man paused, then also looked at the white-robed man. "Moreover, Uncle should have another purpose this time, which is to win over that Grand Offering of the Lu Family, right? What's so special about that Grand Offering that he has earned Uncle's attention?"  As they spoke, the Siyou Clan's army outside the mountain had assembled, and the Grand Offering invited Yuanmiu to board the Lu King's palanquin.</p><p>The sky was pitch black.</p><p>The palanquin ascended, transforming into a rainbow as it headed east. The vast army followed the palanquin with awe-inspiring momentum, their aura soaring to the heavens, causing the wind and clouds to change color!</p><p>The white-robed man calmly watched the Siyou Clan army depart without a word.</p><p>The two brothers exchanged glances, wisely refraining from further questions. The chess-playing man's mind returned to the game. After pondering for a moment, he finally placed a piece.</p><p>'Clack!'  The palanquin led the way, the army followed behind.</p><p>Dark clouds churned in the sky, the clouds like a surging river, flowing eastward.</p><p>The Zhuyan Clan and their vassal clans wouldn't allow them to continue using the teleportation formation, so they could only follow the agreed-upon route, traversing the Zhuyan Clan's territory, and flying to the Storm Realm on their own. They made no attempt to conceal themselves, nor did they need to. As long as Silu was well-informed, he would have certainly received a warning.</p><p>Atop the palanquin, there was a head-sized jade orb. The orb radiated multicolored light, dyeing the dark clouds beneath the army with vibrant hues. The Siyou Clan soldiers felt their bodies lighten, their speed dramatically increasing, while their own energy consumption significantly decreased.</p><p>The army hastened onward. Inside the palanquin, the Grand Offering invited Yuanmiu to the guest seat, while he himself sat below the Lu King.</p><p>The Lu King himself was a Second Stage Mid-Void Realm expert. To his left and right were the Royal Tutor and the Lu Family's Grand Offering.</p><p>Facing three experts alone, Yuanmiu inwardly lamented his predicament.  Those in his clan capable of handling such a situation believed that personally engaging in combat was inferior to cultivating in seclusion, and were unwilling to accept this assignment, pushing it onto him.</p><p>Fortunately, he possessed exceptional composure and was a battle-loving individual. Even on a life-or-death battlefield, he wouldn't flinch. Facing their inquiries, his responses were neither enthusiastic nor cold, befitting his role as a supervisor.</p><p>After a round of exchanges, an awkward silence fell within the palanquin.</p><p>After flying for an unknown distance, the Grand Offering and the Royal Tutor seemed to sense something. They gazed intently ahead, followed by the Lu King. Yuanmiu was the last to perceive an aura in front of them, seemingly awaiting the army.</p><p>This aura was very familiar. Yuanmiu immediately recognized the person's identity, his expression slightly darkening.</p><p>The palanquin slowed down. The Grand Offering rose and flew out of the palanquin, quickly returning with someone.</p><p>The newcomer was Minzhuo, the Patriarch of the Changyou Clan.</p><p>Upon entering the palanquin, Minzhuo immediately saw Yuanmiu. His expression faltered for a moment, then he solemnly bowed. "Minzhuo greets the esteemed envoy Yuan!"</p><p>Nominally, the Changyou Clan was still a vassal clan of the Zhuyan Clan, so etiquette couldn't be neglected.</p><p>Yuanmiu nodded, neither questioning nor reprimanding him directly.</p><p>In truth, Yuanmiu held no ill will towards Minzhuo. As a clan patriarch, he defied powerful forces, refused to compromise, and persevered tirelessly to avenge his people. This temperament resonated with him.</p><p>Since the superior clan wouldn't help them, what right did they have to blame them for seeking help from outsiders?</p><p>If this endeavor succeeded, he would hold Minzhuo in even higher regard.</p><p>Of course, this didn't mean Yuanmiu would favor Minzhuo.</p><p>Minzhuo had braced himself for a storm of reprimands, but unexpectedly, it was lightly brushed aside. He was surprised but also relieved. He stepped forward, cupped his hands, and bowed. "Minzhuo greets King Lu!"</p><p>"You are the Patriarch of the Changyou Clan. Your name has long been known to this king!"</p><p>King Lu was amiable. He gestured with his hand. "We've kept Patriarch Minzhuo waiting. Please, have a seat."</p><p>"Thank you, King Lu, for the seat!"</p><p>Minzhuo sat upright, his gaze fixed straight ahead. "Learning that King Lu is leading an army to seek justice, I am overjoyed. My clan finally has hope for revenge. I have come personally to welcome the royal army!"</p><p>He had prepared many flattering words but swallowed them, worried about provoking Yuanmiu and causing further complications.</p><p>King Lu laughed heartily. "We must also thank Patriarch Minzhuo for sending the warning message, which informed us of the rebels' escape to this place. This expedition to punish the rebels is also to avenge Patriarch Minzhuo. Once the matter is settled, we will all be greatly rewarded.  This king and the Royal Tutor will personally petition the Si Emperor for your merits, Patriarch Minzhuo!"</p><p>As he spoke, he and the Grand Offering looked towards the Royal Tutor. The Royal Tutor, with a smile on his face, was preoccupied with playing with the jade cup in his hand, making no comment.</p><p>They inwardly cursed the old fox. For this meeting with the Si Emperor, King Lu had secured an imperial edict and the Royal Tutor. Apart from the Royal Tutor, the Si Emperor hadn't dispatched a single soldier. The army consisted entirely of King Lu's subordinates and the allies they had invited.</p><p>The wording of the edict was also very carefully chosen, stating that King Lu had presented a memorial to the throne, claiming that the Yanshan Si family had rebelled, with conclusive evidence. The purpose of this expedition was, in name, to bring the descendants of the Si family back to meet the Si Emperor for questioning.</p><p>Thus, if anything went wrong, the royal family could easily distance themselves. Before gaining a significant advantage, they shouldn't expect the Royal Tutor to truly exert himself for them.</p><p>Of course, King Lu wouldn't let the royal family reap the benefits without contributing. After some bargaining, he had also obtained a formation diagram, intending to use it against the enemy's formation.</p><p>Yuanmiu glanced at Minzhuo, thinking that it was indeed the Changyou Clan that had leaked the information.</p><p>Minzhuo showed no sign of pride. He humbly said, "I dare not take credit. This request for help is truly for our own sake. If King Lu can severely cripple the enemy and restore my homeland, I will be content. This is the intelligence I've gathered recently. Please, King Lu, take a look. Unfortunately, the enemy is powerful, and my few old friends dare not offend them. Alone, I dared not get too close."</p><p>Seeing his tact, King Lu was even more satisfied. He beckoned the jade slip into his hand. After reading it, he secretly shook his head.  As Minzhuo had said, there wasn't much valuable information, not as much as Lu Gan had discovered in a single trip.</p><p>King Lu's expression remained unchanged as he handed the jade slip to the Grand Offering and continued to ask, "For this enemy's defeat, does Patriarch Minzhuo have any good strategies?"</p><p>Minzhuo stood up and solemnly said, "My knowledge is limited, and I dare not offer unsolicited advice. I observe that King Lu's army is majestic and formidable, with countless powerful individuals.  Surely, a straightforward and overwhelming assault will be enough to make the enemy tremble with fear! I am willing to lead the elite of my clan and obey King Lu's commands!"</p><p>Yuanmiu listened to the conversation between King Lu and Minzhuo, but he remained with his eyes closed, as if meditating, without uttering a word.</p><p>…</p><p>The Storm Realm.</p><p>At this moment, all the altars had been constructed according to Qin Sang's will, countless altars scattered throughout the Storm Realm.</p><p>The Four Regions of the North Sea, the Middle Continent, the East Sea, the Canglang Sea, the Demon Sea…</p><p>Human Clan, Witch Clan, Demon Clan…</p><p>Shaohua Mountain, Xuantian Palace, Great Compassion Temple, the North Wasteland Demon Clan, the Eight Sceneries View…</p><p>Regardless of race, regardless of righteous or demonic affiliation, all cultivators and forces in the Storm Realm possessing altars received the same command, all standing ready before their altars.</p><p>Zhuque, Silu, and Sunu were currently stationed at the three core branch altars.</p><p>After overseeing the completion of the Canglang Sea altar, Silu had switched places with Zhuque, taking charge of the Western Lands branch altar. The enemy was most likely to attack from the Western Lands, and Silu's presence would be needed then.</p><p>The Witch Clan's Sacred Mountain.</p><p>One of the altars was built upon the broken mountain.</p><p>A Spirit Cicada hovered before the altar, behind which stood a young Witch Clan man, Fang Laomo's adopted son.</p><p>Other branch altars also had varying levels of importance, with different requirements for the person presiding over them. This altar required both Fang Laomo and his adopted son to preside.</p><p>Further back, there were other Witch Clan cultivators, all at the Nascent Soul realm, each with tense expressions.</p><p>Their auras were vastly different from other Witch Clan members because they had been cultivating a Daoist thunder technique in preparation for the altar's activation.</p><p>Fang Laomo remained suspended in mid-air.</p><p>For thousands of miles above the altar, there were no clouds, only silence.</p><p>The young Witch Clan man waited for a long time. Seeing no reaction from the altar, he couldn't help but look up at the sky.  At this moment, he knew countless cultivators in the Storm Realm were waiting anxiously, just like him.</p><p>Unfortunately, the altar remained still.  It wasn't until the sun set and twilight descended that the altar finally trembled, then suddenly radiated a brilliant light, showering the area with a pure glow, emitting strange fluctuations.</p><p>"Activate the altar!"</p><p>Fang Laomo abruptly flew to a position above the altar.</p><p>The young Witch Clan man immediately darted to the front of the altar. The other Witch Clan cultivators dispersed accordingly, forming a circle around the altar, their hands forming seals, ready to cast spells at any moment.</p><p>After waiting for a moment longer, the altar suddenly pulsed with spiritual light, engulfing Fang Laomo's figure.  Then, the sound of cicada chirping echoed in everyone's ears.</p><p>The young Witch Clan man's gaze sharpened, his hand seals rapidly changing.  The sound of thunderclaps reverberated, lightning flashing and thunder rumbling around the altar.</p><p>Amidst the lightning, a larger, illusory altar could be faintly seen, standing tall in the void, as if naturally formed, gathering Heavenly Might, resonating with a mysterious existence in the distance.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded in every corner of the Storm Realm.</p><p>The young Witch Clan man wasn't the altar master, so he could still spare some attention to his surroundings. The astonishment in his eyes grew increasingly intense.  He hadn't felt it before when constructing the altar, but now that it was truly activated, he sensed as though he had merged with an immense and majestic power through the altar.</p><p>He could only vaguely perceive the existence of this majestic power, unaware of its true strength. Yet the altar he stood before was but a corner, an insignificant part of this power!</p><p>Since the Green Ram Temple ceremony, profound awe had once again taken root in his heart!</p><p>At this moment, Sunu, Zhuque, and Silu, stationed at the three core branch altars, also truly felt the power of the formation, their expressions varying.</p><p>The power of countless altars continuously converged towards them.  The individuals presiding over those main altars might be insignificant in the eyes of Void Refinement cultivators, but when the power of so many altars converged, the resulting force was something no one dared to underestimate.  However, while this power was strong, it likely wasn't enough to stop the Siyou Clan army.</p><p>Silu closed his eyes, his eyelids twitching slightly, silently urging himself to remain calm. He only controlled a part of the formation; the main altar was at the Green Ram Temple. Since Qin Sang was so confident, perhaps the completed formation truly possessed world-shaking might!</p><p>Just then, they all felt Qin Sang's will transmitted to them, and they immediately activated the altars according to his command.</p><p>At this moment, the formation truly began to operate, but its power remained concealed, with no astonishing celestial phenomena appearing outside the altars.</p><p>The Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body returned, his Dharma Body merging with him.</p><p>The main altar beneath him was now complete. The lower altar was square, the middle altar octagonal, and the upper altar circular, covered in countless runes, so profound and mystical that they made one dizzy just by looking at them.</p><p>However, the Thunder Altar still lacked one thing, the most crucial component – the Thunder Oath Chapter talisman!</p><p>After conversing with Patriarch Yuanxiang, Qin Sang had gained a better understanding. He quickly returned to the Green Ram Temple to inscribe the talisman.</p><p>The talisman was the core of the altar.  Inscribing the fourth-grade Thunder Oath Chapter talisman was still beyond Qin Sang's current abilities, so he decided to borrow the power of the Qingluan True Thunder.</p><p>He had been preparing for this since his time in Moonripple Bay, making thorough arrangements.</p><p>Next, he continuously drew threads of Qingluan True Thunder from his Phoenix Wings.  As expected, the Qingluan True Thunder was indeed of a high order. Using it to "outline" the runes of the Thunder Oath Chapter talisman was effortless, significantly reducing the burden on Qin Sang.</p><p>One by one, the scattered rune forms were inscribed onto the altar, the process proceeding smoothly until today, when it reached the most critical step.</p><p>Combining the talisman forms!</p><p>For this step, he needed to utilize the formation, gathering the power of all the altar masters to assist him.</p><p>As Sunu, Zhuque, and Silu activated the branch altars, the main altar erupted with divine might, the sky above the Green Ram Temple transforming into a sea of thunder!  Even though the Thunder Oath Chapter talisman hadn't yet taken shape, the might displayed by the Thunder Altar was comparable to its former glory.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was calm, his body enveloped by the illusory shadow of the Thunder Altar.  He spread his wings wide, threads of azure thunder spreading out, his entire being finally transforming into a mass of thunder light, completely merging with the Thunder Altar.</p><p>Within the flashing thunder light, countless runes flickered, yet without any sense of disorder. The runes combined into talisman forms, appearing and disappearing intermittently.</p><p>Although they were just scattered rune forms, they seemed even more complex than third-grade talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang drifted amidst these scattered forms, as if immersed in an ocean of talismans. By successfully combining the Thunder Oath Chapter talisman this time, his understanding of the Dao of Talismans would undoubtedly undergo a complete transformation!</p><p>'Crackle! Sizzle!'  Rumble…  The Green Ram Temple's protective formation was activated, concealing the celestial phenomena.</p><p>Within the sea of thunder, Qin Sang was completely absorbed, guiding each scattered rune form to its designated position.</p><p>Gradually, fewer and fewer scattered forms remained, while a mass of thunder light at the center of the thunder sea grew increasingly brilliant and dazzling.</p><p>The interior of the thunder light was chaotic, indicating that the scattered forms were merging, becoming indistinguishable from one another.  Gradually, a vague outline emerged from within, resembling a sheet of paper formed from thunder light, but not the previous silver, but azure!</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang's figure reappeared above the main altar, though in reality, he had never left.</p><p>'Swish!' Qin Sang opened his eyes, his gaze fixed on the illusory thunder paper. He abruptly struck out with a hand seal.</p><p>At this moment, all the altar masters felt an inexplicable tremor. This sensation vanished in a flash, and before they could react, the power of the altars suddenly receded.</p><p>Sunu, Zhuque, and Silu all sensed that some change had occurred in the altars, but they couldn't quite pinpoint what it was.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and extended a hand.</p><p>An azure sheet of thunder paper, light as a feather, drifted down and landed in his palm, then passed through his hand and merged into the altar.</p>
