<h1>Chapter 613 The Mute Maiden</h1><p>Chapter 613 The Mute Maiden</p><p>The terrifying buzzing and bloodthirsty aura of the blood-winged bees terrified the mountain creatures.  Even tigers and wolves were scared witless, plunging the mountains into chaos.  Strangely, the bees seemed uninterested in the corpse on the ground; none came to bother him.</p><p>Then, the corpse moved.  He flipped over and fell back into the river, seemingly using every ounce of strength to grasp a thick branch with his one remaining arm. He then went still, carried away by the current, escaping the fate of being devoured by the swarm.</p><p>…</p><p>As evening approached, a persistent mountain rain fell, a cool breeze stirring the fine drizzle. The distant mountains looked like dark ink paintings.  On a steeply sloped mountain surrounded by a river, numerous stilt houses were built, tightly clustered together and rising in tiers.  A rough count revealed over a thousand households. This village was called Thousand Households Village.</p><p>Thousand Households Village wasn't particularly large or small compared to its neighbors.  It, along with several other villages, controlled a hundred-mile radius, though most of that area was treacherous and inaccessible to ordinary people.</p><p>Before nightfall, lanterns lit up the village, like stars in the dark. But on the back mountain, a small, dilapidated hut stood alone in the wilderness, surrounded only by a sparse fence.</p><p>Several elaborately dressed young women gathered outside the fence, chattering and urging the girl inside to open the door.</p><p>"Mute Maiden, we heard you rescued a man from the river! Let us see him!"</p><p>"Yes! Yes! Are you hiding him, afraid we'll steal him from you?"</p><p>"To think the Mute Maiden would experience a man’s touch first!  We thought no man would want you! Hee hee…"</p><p>"Mute Maiden, you’re not even sixteen!  Secretly promising your heart, watch out, if the Elder finds out he'll break your legs…"</p><p>"Goodness, this ill-fated girl saved someone!  Hurry and send him away! Otherwise, in a couple of days, he’ll bring another misfortune, and all that saving will be for naught!"</p><p>They pushed at the fence, trying to force their way in to see the man, all the while mocking and teasing.</p><p>The girl inside was anxious and helpless, making "ah ah" sounds, seemingly trying to plead with them to stop, but unable to speak a word.  She was mute; everyone in the village called her the Mute Maiden.</p><p>Her clothes were a stark contrast to the other girls', patched but clean. She kept her face turned, her eyes filled with self-deprecation and timidity.  A closer look revealed a large birthmark on her left cheek, marring her face.</p><p>Just as the Mute Maiden was at her wit's end, a light appeared on the mountain path. An old man approached, carrying a bamboo lantern.</p><p>Seeing the scene, he scolded, "It's night! Go home!"</p><p>The girls, seemingly afraid of the old man, stopped their taunting, stuck out their tongues at the Mute Maiden, and scampered away.</p><p>"If I catch you bullying the Mute Maiden again, I'll break your legs!"  he shouted after them, holding up his lantern.</p><p>"Grandfather Witch Doctor, you always favor the Mute Maiden…" a girl muttered.</p><p>The old man shook his head in annoyance and went to the fence, asking, "Mute Maiden, has that man woken up? Can he walk?"</p><p>The Mute Maiden nodded and made several gestures. The old man, after observing them, grunted, "Good. Once he's better, have Bachai and the others send him away during the Witch God Festival!"</p><p>The Mute Maiden's face fell; she gestured rapidly.</p><p>The old man interrupted her, coldly saying, "Mute Maiden, you're too simple, you don’t understand.</p><p>That man had his arm chopped off, and told you not to let others see him. He's hiding something! Don’t let his pretty looks and sweet words fool you into thinking he’s a good person.</p><p>He’s taking advantage of your kindness!</p><p>If it weren't for your stubbornness, I would have thrown him in the river long ago, forget about treating him. He doesn't have to go at the Witch God Festival, we can wait for a merchant caravan and send him off with them; he can't stay in the village.</p><p>We've been more than kind to keep him this long. The Elder has already asked about him; he can't stay, he’ll bring disaster to our village!</p><p>Mute Maiden, don't worry, when you turn sixteen, Grandfather Witch Doctor will find you a good husband."</p><p>The Mute Maiden's eyes dulled. She lowered her head, unable to argue further.</p><p>An old man offered a small pouch to the mute woman, "Take this. It's some herbs, enough for three brews.  Get that boy healed and gone."</p><p>The mute woman, Ya Gu, accepted the pouch.  Seeing the old man turn to leave, she made a series of urgent gestures, quickly dashed back into the house, grabbed a thick raincoat, and ran to catch up with him.</p><p>"Grandpa is strong, you don't need this. You're frail, go back inside before you catch a chill…"</p><p>The old man waved her away, but Ya Gu shook her head, refusing to be dissuaded, and insisted on putting the raincoat on him.</p><p>"Alas!"</p><p>The old man touched the birthmark on Ya Gu's face, his tone laced with pity.  "Such a good girl, why such a hard life? The Witch God is unjust! The village healer will find a way to remove that birthmark!  And if You Ning and the others bother you again, go to the clan shrine and complain. The village healer will take your side, and they'll get a proper scolding.  They won't dare after that."</p><p>Ya Gu shook her head repeatedly, using sign language to dissuade him.</p><p>"Silly girl, they weren't playing with you…"</p><p>The old man sighed and left.</p><p>After seeing the old man off, Ya Gu returned to her small courtyard, glancing at the almost broken fence with a downcast expression. She went back inside, lit the fire pit, set up a pot, and took out a packet of herbs to begin brewing medicine.  She did this with practiced ease, clearly not for the first time.</p><p>Just then, a 'thump' came from the inner room.</p><p>Ya Gu's face registered immediate concern. She quickly got up, and a one-armed man emerged, his steps weak, as if a light breeze could knock him over, but he was walking.</p><p>"I'm fine. I'm getting better each day."</p><p>The one-armed man sat by the fire, warming himself. He took the hot water Ya Gu offered, saying, "It's all my fault you're involved in this."</p><p>This man was Qin Sang!</p><p>He had none of the imposing presence of a cultivator of his former rank. He was weak, like a commoner recovering from a serious illness.  He'd been sleeping for almost a whole day at a time recently.</p><p>He’d been awakened from his slumber by the shouting outside.</p><p>He sat by the fire, checking his inner energy.  His energy center and meridians were tightly sealed by a strange prohibition spell. His spiritual energy was useless, and his spiritual sense was completely depleted.  There had been some improvement over the past few days, but it was slow. It would still take two days to regain a little strength, enough to open his storage ring.</p><p>A cultivator, reduced to causing trouble for ordinary people, driven away and shunned.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but lament:  A dragon in shallow waters is toyed with by shrimp, a tiger on the plains is bullied by dogs!</p>
