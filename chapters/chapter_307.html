<h1>Chapter 300: Human-headed Birds</h1><p>Chapter 300: Human-headed Birds</p><p>As the words were spoken, darkness suddenly fell upon them, and the human-headed birds lunged at Ge Yuan with a howl. Ge Yuan's pill theft had clearly angered them.</p><p>One of them was smaller, but much faster than the others. Its feathers were hard as wrought iron.</p><p>With a beat of its wings, the human-headed bird became a black streak, arriving above Ge Yuan's head in an instant. Its sharp claws shone with cold light as they closed in on his head.</p><p>The sudden eruption of this human-headed bird's aura was terrifying, even scaring Qin Sang. It was a Late-stage Demon Spirit!</p><p>Apart from it, the other human-headed birds were much weaker. Only one was an Early-stage Demon Spirit, while the rest were mundane.</p><p>No wonder Luo Xingnan and his team had failed to gain an advantage. Facing a Late-stage Demon Spirit, not being killed by the claws of the human-headed birds was already impressive.</p><p>Also, they seemed to be missing someone.</p><p>Only Luo Xingnan, Wandering Child, Shangguan Lifeng, and White Robe Scholar remained.</p><p>Elder Gong was gone!</p><p>Ge Yuan himself was even more terrified.</p><p>This human-headed bird was terrifyingly strong, two whole levels above him.</p><p>Even during normal times, he would find it difficult to escape from this human-headed bird, let alone now, after being sent flying by Luo Xingnan's jade fork. He was at his most vulnerable, and his aura was unstable.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The human-headed bird spread its wings, and the raging wind enveloped by its demonic powers pressed Ge Yuan to the ground, easily destroying his attempt to escape.</p><p>Ge Yuan was terrified. He saw himself on the brink of death by the claws of the bird.</p><p>Just when things reached a critical point, fortunately, Wandering Child moved quickly and threw a yellow copper ring.</p><p>'Swish, swish...'</p><p>The copper ring released a dense yellow light, then split into dozens of identical images in midair, all hitting the human-headed bird.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after being hit by the copper ring, the human-headed bird staggered back and roared in anger. The other human-headed birds seemed to know the power of the copper ring and retreated with cries of alarm.</p><p>Ge Yuan finally found an opportunity to turn around and flee as light.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze and noticed that the formation of Wandering Child and the others had not been broken. Everyone was controlling the same yellow copper ring.</p><p>This was a set of forbidden instruments!</p><p>A sense of understanding dawned on Qin Sang. No wonder they didn't seem too flustered when facing the Late-stage Demon Spirit. It was because of this set of forbidden instruments that they had the ability to fight back.</p><p>Otherwise, they would have met the same fate as Sheng Yuanzi.</p><p>"What are you doing?!"</p><p>Luo Xingnan glared at Wandering Child, annoyed by his unauthorized intervention.</p><p>Wandering Child's expression remained calm. "Fellow Daoist Luo, the low point of the outer formation is almost over. We don't have much time left. Each additional helper is an extra source of power. We must suppress this beast as quickly as possible and free up some people to gather the herbs. That should be our priority!"</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang also received a voice transmission from Wandering Child, who informed him that Elder Gong was dead.</p><p>Like Ge Yuan, he had triggered the enchantment while gathering herbs and alerted the human-headed birds.</p><p>However, Elder Gong was unlucky. He was the human-headed birds' first target, and its claws pierced through his skull, killing him instantly. He had no chance to fight back.</p><p>The others were terrified by this sight and dared not fight alone. They hurriedly gathered together to fend off the monsters' siege. Wandering Child took out this set of forbidden instruments called the Golden Ring Formation, which barely allowed them to hold their ground and withstand the human-headed birds' attacks.</p><p>Even with the help of the Golden Ring Formation, killing the human-headed bird was nearly impossible, and they didn't have time to keep fighting it.</p><p>The only thing they could do was use the power of the forbidden instruments to trap the human-headed bird and free up some people to get the herbs and then escape!</p><p>Luo Xingnan snorted coldly, seeming to accept Wandering Child's explanation. He urged the copper ring to create countless images and continue attacking the human-headed bird. At the same time, he swiped his palm over the copper ring, splitting it into two and tossing them to Qin Sang and Ge Yuan. He said without a doubt, "You two team up to block these birds. I'll go out and gather the herbs!"</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Wandering Child stopped Luo Xingnan. "Fellow Daoist Luo, the monsters are powerful. Without you, we may not be able to suppress them. I think it's better to send Clear Wind Daoist to gather the herbs. We can then divide the herbs equally on the spot."</p><p>Luo Xingnan's face stiffened as he suddenly realized something amiss.</p><p>Luo Xingnan glared with increasing anger at Qin Sang, Ge Yuan and the itinerant monk Yun Youzi, and swore, "Old geezer, are they your men?"</p><p>"I wouldn't say they are anyone's men. I've simply made the acquaintances of these two fellow Taoists," Yun Youzi said calmly.</p><p>"Fine! Excellent!"</p><p>Luo Xingnan smiled in extreme anger, exclaimed "excellent" twice, and said in a voice filled with malice, "The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind it! I shall concede defeat this time! You old geezer, you dare to plot against me? You're daring indeed! Are you not afraid I will kill you?"</p><p>"Fellow Taoist Luo, do not exaggerate!"</p><p>Yun Youzi was not in the least intimidated by the murderous glare Luo Xingnan directed at him. He glanced at Shangguan Lifeng and the white-clad scholar and said, "Esteemed fellow Taoists, we have all ventured into this treacherous place in search of treasures. Unlike Yu Kong, we bear no great grudge against you, Fellow Taoist Luo. Nor has this old man ever thought of harming you, so how could I have plotted against you? From what I have observed, the majority of the spirit medicines on this mountain have been destroyed by these creatures, but seven of them still remain intact. The warding enchantments surrounding the spirit medicines are extremely powerful, and the creatures dare not force their way through. There are six of us present, more than enough for each of us to take one plant. Your earlier promise reflected this as well. Why did you become so angry when I mentioned splitting them equally? Has Fellow Taoist Luo been stringing us along?"</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Confronted directly by Yun Youzi and his finger pointed at the heart of the matter, Luo Xingnan's expression suddenly became rigid. His glare burned with anger and shock.</p><p>Not giving Luo Xingnan another chance to speak, Yun Youzi ignored Shangguan Lifeng and addressed the white-clad scholar. "Esteemed Taoist, what are your thoughts?"</p><p>The white-clad scholar glanced at Luo Xingnan and Shangguan Lifeng, and hesitated for a moment under Luo Xingnan's piercing gaze. "I feel that Fellow Taoist Yun Youzi's words are not without merit."</p><p>As he spoke, the white-clad scholar subconsciously moved closer to Yun Youzi.</p><p>However, Yun Youzi did not wish to press Luo Xingnan too hard, lest he lose his reason. He added, "It will take us much effort to break these enchantments, and Daoist Qingfeng may find it difficult to do it alone. Why not let Fellow Taoist Luo assign someone to work with him? That way, they should have no trouble. Furthermore, we owe our presence here to Fellow Taoist Luo's foresight. It is only fitting that he should take two of these seven spirit medicines. What do the esteemed Taoists think?"</p><p>With Elder Gong surnamed dead, Luo Xingnan's men were down to just Shangguan Lifeng. It was as if Yun Youzi had made it plain without saying so outright.</p><p>Aside from Luo Xingnan, the others were not entitled to more, even if they were greedy, and they all nodded in agreement.</p>
