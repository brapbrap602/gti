<h1>Chapter 1884: The Tai Sui Deity</h1><p>Qin Sang turned his head, seeing encroaching darkness behind him, eyes like sharp swords piercing from the shadows.</p><p>Meeting those malevolent eyes, Qin Sang's pupils constricted, feeling a chilling coldness wash over him, an instinctive tremor far worse than when facing the Spirit You King.</p><p>Though the Spirit You King was powerful, their cultivation levels were roughly comparable.  Now, however, he faced a true demon king, a Void Refinement cultivator!</p><p>A black feathered demon roc’s wings stirred, its feathers like black celestial flames, consuming everything in their path!</p><p>The celestial fire spread towards Qin Sang with terrifying speed; a single flap of its wings spanned vast stretches of cloud sea.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded. The demon roc completely ignored everything else, heading straight for him upon entering the Divine Court.</p><p>‘Roar! Roar!’</p><p>Deafening dragon roars echoed, though upon closer listening, they held less resistance than before.</p><p>Initially, when the golden dragon flew towards the Western Seven Mansions, it frequently turned to look back at the Three Enclosures, reluctant to leave.  Now, it readily obeyed Qin Sang's commands.</p><p>Qin Sang controlled the Divine Inspection Chariot with increasing ease.</p><p>The Divine Inspection Chariot pierced through clouds and mist, leaving a brilliant golden trail.</p><p>Qin Sang slightly narrowed his eyes, calming his mind and sensing the chariot, exploring its remaining powers.</p><p>Simultaneously, a strand of his consciousness constantly monitored the black demon roc behind him.</p><p>Qin Sang was self-aware. Even pushing his Lightning Escape technique to its limit, he couldn’t escape the demon roc.  His only hope lay in the Divine Inspection Chariot being as powerful as Tian Yue Shang Ren claimed.</p><p>The Divine Inspection Chariot proved to be no ordinary treasure.</p><p>Before entering the Divine Court, it seemed to ascend to the Moon Palace and soar over the Celestial Que in the blink of an eye; its speed was immeasurable.</p><p>Although this was likely an illusion caused by the chariot traversing the Divine Court's barriers, its inherent speed was still extraordinary.</p><p>Unless the black demon roc still had plenty of energy left, catching Qin Sang wouldn’t be easy.</p><p>The Divine Inspection Chariot might allow him to hold his own against the demon king for a while, but Qin Sang was unaware of the situation outside, uncertain how far he needed to escape before finding respite.</p><p>He’d only partially repaired the Divine Inspection Chariot; it wasn't fully restored. How long could it last?</p><p>Life or death hung in the balance, filled with unknown fear.</p><p>Someone with weaker resolve would likely collapse under such immense pressure.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Staring at the fleeing Divine Inspection Chariot, the black demon roc snorted coldly. Its feathers exploded outwards, creating a rustling sound.</p><p>The sound intensified, quickly becoming a howling gale.</p><p>A wind actually arose, black smoke billowing from the demon roc, transforming into a demonic wind of immense scale.</p><p>The demonic wind swept across the cloud sea as the demon roc pursued.</p><p>At the edges of the demonic wind, the black smoke gradually faded and disappeared, seeming to merge with the surrounding clouds.</p><p>Then, with a piercing shriek, the black demon roc's speed surged, instantly closing a vast distance between it and Qin Sang.</p><p>The demon roc was connecting with the Divine Court, leveraging its power to some extent – a feat possible only due to its status as a demon god.</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked. The situation was far worse than anticipated. If the black demon roc maintained this speed, it would soon catch up!</p><p>In reality, being newly arrived in the Divine Court, the black demon roc couldn't sustain this indefinitely. But as it grew more familiar with the Divine Court, the situation would become increasingly disadvantageous to Qin Sang.</p><p>The demonic wind howled behind him.</p><p>Qin Sang relentlessly pushed the Divine Inspection Chariot, the dragon roaring thunderously, yet unable to prevent the relentless approach of its enemy.</p><p>The golden trail passed between two celestial mountains, both topped with collapsed and ruined golden palaces.</p><p>Ahead, the Western White Tiger Seven Mansions were in sight.</p><p>But even reaching the Western Seven Mansions, what could he do?</p><p>Qin Sang used part of his consciousness to sense the Divine Court's Celestial Star Array, finding similarities with the Seven Mansions Sub-division Sword Array, but this connection was insufficient to let him control the Divine Court.</p><p>An unusual tearing sound echoed behind him.</p><p>Alarm surged through Qin Sang's heart, a warning from his Sky-Eyed Butterfly arriving simultaneously, a vision appearing in his mind.</p><p>An unseen black demonic wind had gathered behind him, swirling clouds into a dark storm cloud overhead.</p><p>A thunderclap.</p><p>Black demonic lightning shot from the storm cloud, incredibly violent, striking towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of confronting it directly. With a thought, the golden dragon rapidly changed course, and the Divine Inspection Chariot arced through the clouds.</p><p>The demonic lightning narrowly missed the Divine Inspection Chariot, exploding into the cloud sea.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly sensed the terrifying power contained within the demonic lightning.</p><p>One bolt of demonic lightning missed its mark, the dark clouds churned, and instantly, new bolts were born from within.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Bolt after bolt of demonic lightning struck relentlessly.</p><p>While Qin Sang evaded, the black demonic roc swiftly closed the distance between them.</p><p>Amidst the creation and destruction of lightning, a silvery gleam flickered within the depths of the dark clouds, vaguely revealing a circular ancient mirror.</p><p>“It’s a magical treasure…”</p><p>Qin Sang dodged, this thought flashing through his mind, causing a stir in his heart.</p><p>Against magical treasures, the Blood-Soiling Divine Light still had a strange effect.</p><p>However, in the current situation, Qin Sang dared not stop to counterattack, he could only endure and wait for an opportunity.</p><p>But his enemy wouldn't give him a chance. After closing the distance, the black demonic roc attacked again.</p><p>Uncharacteristically, it suddenly soared upwards, its cry like thunder, its momentum rising steadily, completing its build-up before diving down from the high altitude.</p><p>Qin Sang found that the surrounding light was growing dim, strong winds whipped around the Divine Inspection Chariot, and tremendous pressure bore down from above.</p><p>At this moment, the sky above the Divine Inspection Chariot was completely plunged into darkness, as if shrouded by an oppressive canopy of clouds, and swirling masses of visible black demonic winds coalesced, obscuring the sun.</p><p>The Divine Inspection Chariot traveled alone in the wind, giving a feeling of utter isolation and helplessness.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>A demonic gale arose.</p><p>A terrifying hurricane descended, stretching as far as the eye could see, with the Divine Inspection Chariot right in the center.  No matter which direction it fled, it could not escape the hurricane's range.</p><p>Qin Sang truly experienced the demonic roc's power, finding it even more terrifying than the demonic king's apparition that had nearly captured him outside the Governing Altar.</p><p>At this moment, escape seemed impossible!</p><p>Qin Sang, remaining calm under pressure, jerked the reins sharply, bringing the chariot's forward momentum to an abrupt halt.</p><p>The golden dragon ceased its charge, raised its head, and let out a roar even louder than before.</p><p>The black demonic roc behind narrowed its eyes, sensing something amiss, and hastily activated the lightning mirror, unleashing several more bolts of demonic lightning.</p><p>Just as the demonic wind was about to engulf the Divine Inspection Chariot, the golden scales on the golden dragon shimmered, emitting a blinding golden light that enveloped the entire chariot.</p><p>The Divine Inspection Chariot was swallowed by the demonic wind, the golden light instantly dissipated, and the chariot vanished into thin air!</p><p>The next moment, beyond the hurricane, a golden light suddenly appeared.</p><p>The black demonic roc's expression changed drastically, it abruptly turned its head, and saw the Divine Inspection Chariot reappear in a golden light, with the golden dragon pulling it and Qin Sang on his jade throne, completely unharmed.</p><p>The Divine Inspection Chariot could actually traverse the void, possessing the ability to teleport!</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The reins tightened, the golden dragon, without looking back, pulled the Divine Inspection Chariot onward.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, still feeling a lingering sense of fear when he thought about the pressure he had just faced.</p><p>Teleportation was a supernatural ability Qin Sang had gleaned from the Divine Inspection Chariot.</p><p>In fact, the Divine Inspection Chariot itself couldn't teleport, but through its close connection with the Divine Court, it could ‘jump’ within a certain range.</p><p>However, this came at a cost.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack!’</p><p>Qin Sang heard faint sounds emanating from the Divine Inspection Chariot beneath him.</p><p>His greatest fear had come to pass. Teleportation put a huge strain on the Divine Inspection Chariot. His repairs were too crude; each teleportation caused damage, accumulating with each jump, he wondered how many times it could withstand this.</p><p>The only fortunate thing was that using the Divine Inspection Chariot didn't consume much of his own energy.</p><p>Behind him, the demonic wind howled, and the black demonic roc, regrouping, pursued.</p><p>Each teleportation had to be used at the most critical moment.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang felt a stir in his sleeve.</p><p>“I’m going to die! I’m going to die!”</p><p>Red flames flickered from his sleeve, accompanied by the shriek of the young Vermilion Bird spirit, “Ah! Ah! Ah! Why are you being chased again?!”</p><p>Qin Sang found the words somewhat familiar.  Someone else had said something similar.</p><p>He felt utterly helpless. It had been a routine refinement; who would have thought it would cause such a huge disturbance?</p><p>“Do you have any good ideas?”</p><p>Qin Sang seemed desperate, appealing to the young Vermilion Bird spirit for help.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>The young Vermilion Bird spirit was speechless, exasperated.</p><p>It could currently only control the nine Sunbirds on the divine tree, and even if all nine were unleashed, they probably wouldn't be able to harm the demonic roc.</p><p>Should it release the Vermilion Bird's aura to create a bluff?</p><p>But the opponent was a demonic king, and the deception would surely be seen through immediately.</p><p>Seeing that the young Vermilion Bird spirit remained silent, Qin Sang sighed inwardly, realizing he could only rely on himself.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Lightning rained down, a furious bombardment.</p><p>Bolt after bolt of demonic lightning grazed the edges of the Divine Inspection Chariot, narrowly avoiding a direct hit.</p><p>Under the onslaught of lightning, they fled frantically. Thanks to the golden dragon's extraordinary speed and agility, and Qin Sang's precise judgment, they remained unharmed for now.</p><p>The good times didn't last.  When the Black Roc closed the distance and attacked again, Qin Sang could only escape using instantaneous movement.</p><p>During the chase, Qin Sang entered the Western Seven Mansions, quickly showing disappointment.  As expected, even with his mastery of the Seven Mansions Sword Formation, he could do little.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Suddenly, a black rainbow fell from the sky.  Appearing out of nowhere without warning, its speed was astonishing, locking onto the Divine Inspection Chariot.  There was no way to avoid it; only instantaneous movement could save them.</p><p>At that moment, the Divine Inspection Chariot was about to pass over a mountain peak, where a golden hall stood. The hall was intact, radiating a brilliant light.  This light formed a protective barrier on the hall’s surface, emitting a strange aura.</p><p>“Go inside!”  the young Zhuque suddenly cried out.</p><p>“That’s precisely what I intend to do!” Qin Sang flicked the reins, and the golden dragon dived towards the golden hall.  It easily passed through the light barrier; the door was as if it wasn't there, and they passed right through.</p><p>He had observed these golden halls for a long time. The light barrier was a special boundary, but its aura was very similar to the golden dragon's.  Trying it now, it proved to be no obstacle.  The question was whether the demon god could pass through the light barrier, and how strong the barrier was.</p><p>Entering the hall, the first thing they saw was a statue. Offerings were placed before it, but unlike earthly temples, this one lacked incense and the presence of worshippers.  The statue depicted a refined man wearing a tall hat, with a red face, golden armor, black robes, and holding a bow and arrow.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the plaque he had seen when entering:  'Gengchen Taisui'! As the name suggests, this hall was dedicated to the god Gengchen Taisui.</p><p>In Daoist scriptures, Gengchen Taisui is one of the sixty Jiazi Taisui gods, also known as the Sixty Yuanchen.  The sixty Jiazi Taisui gods are also celestial deities.</p><p>In the calendar system, the ten Heavenly Stems and twelve Earthly Branches are paired cyclically, forming a sixty-year cycle called the sixty Jiazi, with sixty Taisui gods taking turns presiding over each year.</p><p>Some believe that the Taisui god of one's birth year influences their fortune throughout life, considering it their natal deity. There's also a belief in offending the Taisui, leading to people worshipping them for good fortune.</p><p>These, of course, are just legends. Gengchen Taisui, among the sixty Taisui gods, is not a legendary deity.</p><p>Through his Heavenly Eye ability, it was clear that Gengchen Taisui's body was not carved from wood or clay, nor was it solid. It was composed of countless talismans, essentially a divine talisman itself. Far more complex than ordinary talismans, it possessed a mysterious aura unlike any other, truly resembling a deity.</p><p>This was the ‘celestial god’ the Daoist court spoke of – a talisman god born from the cultivation of talisman arts!</p><p>Gengchen Taisui's eyes were wide open, as if watching Qin Sang, the uninvited guest, exuding an aura of authority without anger.  But it clearly lacked sentience.</p><p>“A Taisui god…”  Qin Sang thought of the Wan Shen Lei Si Xian Yin he had obtained.  The Daoist court's Battle Department also had corresponding Xian Yin.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's understanding, the sixty Jiazi Taisui gods' positions weren't high.  Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment Daoists could invite them as guardian deities with their cultivation techniques.</p><p>“Can a Taisui god's temple withstand a demon king's attack?” Qin Sang felt anxious, looking outside the hall.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The black rainbow struck the temple, causing the temple and mountain to violently shake, releasing intense light.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The black rainbow nearly swallowed the temple. The light barrier, though shaking violently, stubbornly resisted, not being destroyed immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang's face brightened.  It seemed the power of the light barrier and the talisman god's position weren't completely correlated.</p><p>“I wonder if the light barrier of a higher-ranking talisman god's temple would be stronger. If it could withstand the Black Roc…”</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind as he sensed the black rainbow's furious assault on the light barrier, along with the wild bombardment of demon thunder.  It seemed the Black Roc was helpless against the light barrier and could only resort to brute force.</p><p>The demon king's power was truly formidable.  The temple shook violently; the light barrier wouldn't last long.</p><p>At that moment, a sword light shot out from the temple, its momentum earth-shattering as it slashed towards the void, where the source of the demon thunder – the Thunder Mirror – was located.</p><p>A sneer flashed across the Black Roc's eyes.  As it rapidly approached, it remotely activated the Thunder Mirror, unleashing a mass of pitch-black demon thunder to engulf the sword light.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the sword light didn't clash directly with the demon thunder.  It abruptly stopped, revealing a spirit sword that shot out a beam of blood light, not sword energy.</p><p>The Black Roc immediately sensed danger, but it was too late to retract its treasure.  Hit by the foul blood light, its treasure's brilliance dimmed.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't linger.  He sheathed his sword, seizing the weakened black rainbow's power to escape, continuing his flight. He knew the demon king wouldn't have only one treasure. This action might not have much effect, but he had to do everything he could to weaken the enemy, even if it only accumulated a small chance of victory.</p><p>(End)</p>
