<h1>Chapter 545: Choosing an Auxiliary Path</h1><p>Compared to the immense gains, this small aftereffect was entirely acceptable.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Ebony Sword, enveloped himself in its light, and flew away.</p><p>…</p><p>Earth Sinkhole.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively concealed his presence, diving into the depths of the Earth Sinkhole.  His divine sense reached out, confirming that the ghoul remained obediently in its original position.  He breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he undid the sealing restrictions he had placed before leaving.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>Earthly Yin Qi surged restlessly.</p><p>A demonic figure slowly emerged from the abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the Night Fiend. Its outward appearance revealed nothing.</p><p>After many days apart, there was a faint sense of unfamiliarity. However, the soul mark remained firm. Qin Sang commanded the Night Fiend to fly before him, and his divine sense probed into its dantian.</p><p>The Corpse Pill was covered in cracks and still appeared extremely withered, but its condition was better than when he left, indicating that recuperation within the Earth Sinkhole was indeed effective.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently, sat cross-legged, and ordered the Night Fiend to sit facing him. Then, his divine sense extended fully, enveloping the Corpse Pill as he carefully observed it.</p><p>At the edge of the Yin Qi, darkness reigned.</p><p>Man and ghoul sat facing each other, the Night Fiend’s eyes pitch black and vacant.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense and fell into deep thought.</p><p>He meticulously recalled every detail of the Corpse Pill refinement process, as well as his understanding of the Corpse Pill during his battle with Wu Youdao.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang began to grasp some clues.</p><p>He couldn't directly heal the Night Fiend. Even unsealing the Corpse Pill wouldn't have a significantly better effect. However, he could guide the Night Fiend to pinpoint the root cause and accelerate its absorption of Earthly Yin Qi, thus speeding up its recovery.</p><p>He immediately put his plan into action.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, waved his hand to set up a circle of restrictions, and then triggered the soul mark within the Night Fiend, forcibly seizing control.</p><p>Within the dantian, the Corpse Pill rotated extremely slowly, almost stagnant.</p><p>Countless strands of Earthly Yin Qi surrounded the Corpse Pill but could only seep into its cracks at an agonizingly slow pace. The recovery speed was predictably slow.</p><p>At this moment, under Qin Sang’s will, he risked shattering the Corpse Pill by forcibly driving it to rotate slowly.</p><p>This single action affected everything. The Yin Qi within the dantian immediately began to vibrate violently.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression was serious, even more so than when treating himself. He was afraid that a moment of carelessness would lead to the destruction of the pill and the death of the ghoul.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the healing process went much smoother than Qin Sang anticipated.</p><p>He cautiously guided a wisp of Earthly Yin Qi into the Corpse Pill. Perhaps due to the years of recuperation, the Corpse Pill remained relatively stable during this process.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later, Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense, a hint of fatigue in his eyes.</p><p>Although he was only assisting, the consumption of his divine sense was considerable. Fortunately, the results were good.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the Night Fiend turned and jumped into the Earthly Yin Qi. From now on, he only needed to visit every few days to help the Night Fiend correct its course, eliminating the need to remain there constantly.</p><p>“At this rate, its injuries should mostly recover in about three months. I’ll fill the Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle with Earthly Yin Qi and go to Hanging Skull Pass to help it fully recover. With a little over a year left before the Violet Firmament Palace opens, who knows what might happen. It’s best to take the ancient传送阵 there early…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered these things as he stood up and quietly left the Earth Sinkhole.</p><p>On his way back to Mount Shaohua, Qin Sang also visited the markets around the mountain gate to inquire about recent developments.</p><p>Although the Small Cold Territory and the Heavenly March Alliance hadn't withdrawn their troops from the Chaotic Isles, they hadn't clashed in over two months. The atmosphere in the Small Cold Territory had relaxed considerably and was almost back to how it was before the war began.</p><p>Several major markets had reopened, and the cultivators who had gone into hiding could finally emerge and resume their activities, creating a scene of prosperity.</p><p>Qin Sang visited several trading houses, making substantial purchases.</p><p>Although Dove Robe Daoist was a fugitive, a dying camel is still bigger than a horse.  After unlocking the restrictions on the iron finger guard and obtaining Dove Robe Daoist’s possessions, Qin Sang was now quite wealthy. Aside from a more than ample supply of healing pills, he bought various spiritual medicines and magical artifacts to prepare for all sorts of situations.</p><p>Of course, the four high-grade spirit stones were untouchable.</p><p>The iron finger guard had ample space, so he wasn't worried about it being filled.</p><p>After spending a whole day and placing several deposits, Qin Sang flew back to Mount Shaohua with satisfaction.</p><p>The mountain gate was wide open.</p><p>Peach blossoms adorned the mountain, and the forests were vibrant with color. Many young female disciples were enjoying the flowers and playing in the woods. This scene reminded Qin Sang of when he first joined the sect.</p><p>The beautiful scenery remained, but many familiar faces were gone.</p><p>Senior Brother Wen, with no hope of forming his Gold Core and his lifespan nearing its end, had returned to his hometown to live out his remaining days.</p><p>Zhuang Yan was busy dual cultivating with his partner.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou was in secluded cultivation and not receiving visitors.</p><p>His other old friends were likely not at the sect either.</p><p>Qin Sang thought about it for a moment, realizing there was no one he particularly wanted to see.  He shook his head and flew alone towards the cave dwelling Zhuang Yan had lent him.</p><p>Mount Shaohua had a rule: after a disciple formed their Gold Core, they could, like when they reached Foundation Establishment, update their jade register.  The associated increase in status, spirit stones, and other benefits went without saying.</p><p>Even more enticing was that the sect would not only hold a Gold Core ceremony for them but would also fund the construction of an extravagant cave dwelling at a location of their choosing, either within or outside the mountain gate.</p><p>Of course, the accompanying responsibilities could not be shirked.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t care for fame or ceremonies, but the cave dwelling was very appealing.</p><p>His Spiritual Spring cave dwelling, although rich in spiritual energy, paled in comparison to a true Gold Core cave dwelling.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't sure whether the sect would recognize his current state, possessing only an external core.</p><p>Since there wasn’t much time left, he decided to wait until he returned from the Violet Firmament Palace and formed a true Gold Core before informing the sect.</p><p>For now, it was best not to let anyone know that he possessed an external core at the Pseudo Core Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang resolved to keep his accomplishments hidden.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling, with his cultivation unable to progress further and no need to worry about forming his Gold Core, Qin Sang was finally free from the relentless pressure of cultivation and could focus on other areas.</p><p>He needed to explore the myriad arts of cultivation.</p><p>Ultimately, Qin Sang chose to focus on two areas.</p><p>The first was the study of formations and restrictions.</p><p>These two were interconnected.  Qin Sang had some skill in restrictions, and with the *Taixuan Formation Fragment* obtained from the Yuan Mirage Sect disciple, he could study them together.</p><p>The second was beast mastery.</p><p>Qin Sang had often consulted the Gold Core insights of the Spirit Controlling Sect from Earth Deficiency Elder's legacy to cultivate his Bloodwing Ghost Head Bees, but he hadn't truly delved into it.  Now, he could carefully explore this path.</p><p>After forming his Gold Core, his cultivation speed was no longer a hindrance. Choosing one or more auxiliary paths to enhance his strength was a logical next step.</p><p>From then on, Qin Sang’s life followed a regular pattern.</p><p>He visited the Earth Sinkhole every few days, otherwise remaining secluded in his cave dwelling, rarely interacting with others.</p>
