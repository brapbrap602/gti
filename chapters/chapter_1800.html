<h1>Chapter 1791: Fierce Battle</h1><p>Distant mountains resembled dark eyebrows.</p><p>The land was a vibrant green.</p><p>In the vast forest, countless trees, some thick enough for dozens of men to embrace, stood tall.</p><p>A winding stream flowed through the woods, its banks adorned with lush grass and blooming flowers, a scene of vibrant life.</p><p>The only flaw was the unsettling silence.</p><p>No wind, no insects chirping, no birdsong – no sound at all.</p><p>The absence of sound indicated a lack of life.  Without wind, the plants remained motionless.</p><p>This was an unusually peaceful place within the Jushan area, yet the vast forest held an eerie stillness, like a vivid painting suspended in the void.  Being there, one felt not only tranquility but also a sense of dread.</p><p>This peace was shattered.</p><p>But this space was remarkably stable; the forest trembled only slightly.</p><p>Above the forest was a deep azure sky, as if thick, blue winds piled up, forming a heavy wall, interspersed with faint golden light.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gap ripped open in the azure wall, torn from the outside, and a meteor plummeted from the heavens.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The meteor fell swiftly, crashing into the forest, causing widespread destruction.</p><p>Around the impact site, the shockwave spread outwards, causing the treetops to surge like green waves.  </p><p>At the center of the impact, thick branches were broken, ancient trees lay toppled, a scene of utter devastation, with a human-shaped crater in the ground.</p><p>Immediately, a figure burst from the crater, looking up, their expression shifting between anger and uncertainty.</p><p>The gap in the wall slowly closed, but a figure emerged calmly from within – Li Hou.</p><p>The one who had been struck down was Qin Sang, pursued relentlessly by Li Hou.</p><p>“Not running?”</p><p>Li Hou descended gracefully, a mocking smile in his eyes.</p><p>He first surveyed the area, his expression guarded, but finding nothing amiss, he nodded subtly.</p><p>He hadn't expected such a safe haven within Jushan.</p><p>This was undoubtedly a perfect killing ground; this person had found himself an excellent tomb!</p><p>Outside, he had to contend with unpredictable attacks, preventing him from using his full power, and his opponent could use this to evade his attacks – frustrating.</p><p>Otherwise, Li Hou believed he would have already captured his prey.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, his voice laced with anger and defiance.</p><p>He raised his right arm; his robe was torn, revealing three horrifying claw marks on his skin.</p><p>Similar wounds marred his body in several places.</p><p>Even though the robe was a magical artifact, it couldn't withstand Li Hou's claws, and was now tattered.</p><p>The claw marks tore through his skin, revealing red flesh, but not deep enough to reach the bone.</p><p>This was partly because Li Hou hadn't had a chance to strike with full force, and partly because Qin Sang continuously activated the King Kong Heavenly Armor Seal, providing protection akin to wearing golden armor.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang had directly countered the attacks of a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator using only the King Kong Heavenly Armor Seal.</p><p>Previously, when hunting the Thunder Turtle and Wood Jiao, one was injured, and the other had help, leaving Qin Sang to easily fend off only the shockwaves.</p><p>This time, every direct hit greatly depleted his physical energy, but the seal's power did not disappoint.</p><p>Combined with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's Separation and Union Divine Light, Qin Sang felt he could face Li Hou's claws directly without needing other protective treasures or abilities.</p><p>This boosted Qin Sang's confidence.</p><p>Most importantly, upon entering this place, Qin Sang immediately sensed abundant wood spirit energy – the very treasure he had been searching for!</p><p>His blood surged towards the wounds, instantly staunching the bleeding; the claw marks began to close.</p><p>He glared at Li Hou with a desperate look, but didn't rush to activate his Wood Spirit Body.</p><p>Li Hou was no Thunder Turtle or Wood Jiao; as a Demon Marquis, his intelligence, decisiveness, and abilities far surpassed those of mere beasts; if the situation turned unfavorable, he would flee.</p><p>Qin Sang aimed not only to defeat his opponent but also to kill him!</p><p>Bringing back the corpse of a mid-Nascent Soul Demon Marquis would not only earn him advancement but also allow him to make further demands on the Dao Court.</p><p>Dealing with such an opponent required strategy.</p><p>Of course, this was only an initial plan; if things turned dire, he would try to shake off Li Hou and seek another target.</p><p>Unfazed by the wolfish stare, Li Hou licked his lips, revealing a greedy gaze.</p><p>For humans, a demon beast was a treasure trove.</p><p>And vice versa.</p><p>The Dao Court and Guifang had been at loggerheads for a long time, and even as a Demon Marquis, he hadn't enjoyed the delicacy of a Cave Profound True Person.</p><p>Qin Sang's wings were the only thing that puzzled Li Hou.  The many-layered phoenix wings were incredibly realistic, not like a magical artifact, but rather as if they had grown from Qin Sang himself. Each flap, unleashing thunder escape technique, seemed like an innate ability.</p><p>This was indeed the case. Qin Sang only used the inherent thunder escape technique of the phoenix wings, consuming only his physical energy and not his true essence to activate the Azure Luan's thunder power, because he didn't want to reveal his dual cultivation of physical body and true essence.</p><p>After breaking through the fifth level of *Tian Yao Bian*, the phoenix wings had undergone a transformation, and his thunder escape technique had greatly improved. Even without the Azure Luan's thunder power, it was a superior escape technique.</p><p>"This Marquis wants to see just how tough your flesh is!"</p><p>Leaving behind a sharp whistle, Li Hou vanished into thin air.</p><p>The earth beneath Qin Sang suddenly churned violently, creating waves of mud that caused devastating damage to the surrounding forest.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>…</p><p>Countless trees snapped and fell, and the hard ground turned into a swamp, instantly swallowed by the mud waves.</p><p>In an instant, the area within a thousand meters around Qin Sang became a swamp, with a hole appearing in the center of the swamp, directly facing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately sensed something was wrong. A powerful suction force erupted from the hole, locking onto him.</p><p>'Creak creak creak...'</p><p>Qin Sang's flesh and blood trembled, his bones cracking. He stood firmly in mid-air, not sucked into the hole, but his movements were distorted, preventing him from immediately escaping.</p><p>Soundlessly, a claw the size of a baby's fist appeared above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>The claw had only three fingers, with slightly curved black nails like sharp knives, aimed at Qin Sang's head, stabbing downwards!  If struck, Qin Sang's head would instantly be pierced.</p><p>With the Sky-Eyed Butterfly providing vigilance, Qin Sang didn't even raise his head. The moment the claw appeared, he discovered the attacker. He raised his arms, using the Destroyer Seal with both palms, meeting the claw head-on.</p><p>A sound like metal clashing was heard. Qin Sang was struck hard, his body plummeting downwards. He twisted slightly in mid-air, lessening the impact, and flew diagonally away, just avoiding the hole.</p><p>Above, a strange beast appeared.</p><p>This beast was badger-like, only as tall as a child, entirely black, covered in fine scales from head to tail. Even its small eyes were protected by scales; once it closed its eyes, its entire body was without a flaw.</p><p>"Li Feng Badger!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, recognizing the beast's origin. Li Hou was actually a cultivated Li Feng Badger.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was little information on the Li Feng Badger; Qin Sang didn't know what innate abilities it possessed, but judging by Li Hou's previous actions, it seemed to be related to earth element.</p><p>The Li Hou, now in its beast form, rolled its eyes, staring at Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>Three blood-red claw marks were on Qin Sang's palm, but no serious injuries were inflicted; he recovered completely with a slight circulation of his blood.</p><p>Li Hou showed a human-like expression of surprise. It had directly transformed into its beast form intending a swift victory, believing its beast form's power would surpass its human form. Yet that one claw hadn't even disabled Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>Unbeknownst to it, this was the effect of the Lihe Divine Light combined with the Diamond Heavenly Armor Seal.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that the Lihe Divine Light not only weakened abilities but also dispersed the force of Li Hou's attack.</p><p>He and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly hadn't fully understood the Lihe Divine Light. In his rudimentary understanding, it could be likened to the divine light forming a smooth convex surface. No matter how concentrated the force, upon contact with the surface, it would disperse due to the lack of purchase.</p><p>Of course, it was certainly not that simple.</p><p>The dispersion of force was equivalent to weakening it. The power of spirit insect abilities inherently surpasses that of same-level妖修 and cultivators.  Combined with the Diamond Heavenly Armor Seal, this was the result.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed what Li Hou was thinking and sneered, seemingly seeking peace, "We have no mortal feud; let's leave each other alone. Why must Marquis Li Hou pursue this to the death?"</p><p>Li Hou remained unmoved, staring at Qin Sang's palm, its eyes rapidly rotating.</p><p>Because the Lihe Divine Light was invisible and colorless, it could adhere to Qin Sang's body and was imperceptible to the naked eye.</p><p>It snorted coldly, disbelieving that an opponent of inferior cultivation could have defenses strong enough to render it helpless.</p><p>Qin Sang caught sight of the badger shadow out of the corner of his eye, his heart chilled. He swung his arm outward, the power of the Buddha seal forming a massive shadow.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The two separated instantly; Li Hou's true form appeared on the other side of Qin Sang.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, countless badger shadows surrounded Qin Sang, trapping him, leaving him unable to move.</p><p>The badger shadows were in various poses, but all their claws aimed at Qin Sang's vital points.</p><p>A continuous 'bang bang' sound was heard. Qin Sang was almost constantly circling, his palms striking repeatedly, his palm wind like thunder, shattering the badger shadows one by one.</p><p>A human and a demon battled fiercely.  Their clashing energy created a swirling vortex of dust and debris, ripping through the forest, leaving a deep scar in its wake.  The combatants were almost invisible within the heart of the storm.</p><p>Suddenly, a deafening explosion shattered the vortex, showering the area with mud and filth. Qin Sang, his arms crossed over his chest, was flung backward. Yet, he remained unharmed.</p><p>Li Hou, perched high above, looked down at Qin Sang with even greater fighting spirit. He spread his claws, a light gathering in each palm, forming spectral sheaths that fitted snugly over his sharp talons.</p><p>The demon's use of these artifacts, while unusual for their kind, showed their pragmatic nature.  Qin Sang's expression grew grave; he recognized these claw-sheaths as custom-made, powerful weapons, at least at the pseudo-spiritual treasure level. He doubted his own protective arts could fully withstand them.</p><p>Without pause, Li Hou attacked, his clawed hands aiming for Qin Sang's chest. Qin Sang twisted his body, his thunder wings beating furiously.  Despite the contortion, his movements remained precise; he unleashed his protective seals, a perfect balance of strength and flexibility. He entangled the claws, using the recoil to send himself flying backward.</p><p>But this wasn't enough to stop Li Hou. Another vicious attack followed immediately, forcing Qin Sang to use his thunder wings and his martial arts to desperately parry Li Hou's blows. This exchange, though less visually spectacular than the first, was far more dangerous.  A blur of lightning and shadow danced across the battlefield, from the sky to the ground, filling the forest with their furious struggle.</p><p>Gradually, Li Hou became surprised.  While he maintained the upper hand, he realized Qin Sang's combat experience was extraordinary.  His superior evasion skills and powerful defense allowed him to dodge many attacks; those he couldn't avoid, he endured, focusing on protecting himself from the deadly claws.  Li Hou couldn't completely restrain Qin Sang.</p><p>Li Hou's innate fighting instincts, inherited from his ancestors, were exceptional. Yet, Qin Sang’s were just as strong, perhaps even stronger, overwhelming the difference in cultivation level.  Li Hou had sparred with other demon lords of similar strength and easily dominated them using the power of heaven and earth. Qin Sang, however, showed no such weakness.</p><p>Unless he wasn’t a demon cultivator, he was a seasoned killer, forged in countless battles.  His potential was immense; once fully grown, he would become a major threat to Gui Fang.</p><p>This strengthened Li Hou’s resolve to kill Qin Sang.  Qin Sang was powerful, but only for his level; Li Hou didn't believe him to be a true threat, since he hadn't used his full power.</p><p>He observed that Qin Sang's techniques were extremely draining. His energy was visibly waning with each thunder escape and collision.  Li Hou was also expending energy, but at a slower rate. He just needed to continue the assault; soon enough, he would find an opening for a decisive victory.</p><p>With this thought, Li Hou slightly eased his attack.  The earth rumbled, the entire forest shaking violently.  The soil hardened into rock, rising and contorting.</p><p>Numerous shadowy figures erupted from the ground, rushing toward Qin Sang. They were badger-like creatures formed from rock.  Qin Sang shattered them one after another, yet the dust and debris didn’t disperse, creating a vast mire that swallowed him whole.</p><p>Li Hou moved through the mud, forcing Qin Sang to fight for survival. Sensing Qin Sang's weakening energy, Li Hou smiled cruelly, but with a hint of caution. Even a cornered beast fights back, especially a cultivator of his caliber.</p><p>Dust filled the air, the sky a murky yellow. Suddenly, the dust swirled inward, solidifying into rock.  With a series of resounding crashes, countless rocks encased Li Hou, forming a stone armor.  His small body transformed into a colossal stone beast, nearly a hundred zhang tall, its fists like falling meteors, smashing into the ground.</p><p>A figure was sent crashing into the earth. Li Hou emerged from his stone armor, his expression grim.  A massive ancient tree had risen from the ground, its roots pushing the earth apart, a torrent of wood energy surging around it.</p>
