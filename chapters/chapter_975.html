<h1>Chapter 967: Blood Restriction</h1><p>“Ninth Aunt!”</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi waved her hand, her voice bright and full of anticipation.  “Are there any treasures inside?”</p><p>Nine-Phoenix King smiled, clearly pleased with her findings.</p><p>“This was originally a medicinal garden, no magical artifacts. The garden was quite large and dilapidated, but I found several spirit herbs that will help me heal.  Once I refine them, my injuries should be completely recovered…”</p><p>The demons were secretly surprised. They didn't know how severely Nine-Phoenix King had been injured, that it hadn’t healed even after so long.</p><p>Nine-Phoenix King landed before the demons.</p><p>She was spotless, looking no different than when she had left.</p><p>“I have checked; there are no other hidden treasures here. We shouldn't delay; it’s time to attend to the main task.”</p><p>Exiting the moon gate,</p><p>Nine-Phoenix King lightly traced a seal, leading the demons away.</p><p>After a ripple in the wall’s enchantment, a flash of light, the wall returned to its original state, and the moon gate vanished.</p><p>…</p><p>Flower Fairy Lake entrance.</p><p>The demons descended from the wooden bridge.</p><p>Nine-Phoenix King flew to a peak, gazing into the distance, observing the Seven Killing Hall’s terrain.</p><p>Several areas within the Seven Killing Hall were prominent, visible even from here.  For example, the Heavenly Tower, the Celestial Platform, and the mysterious inner hall shrouded in a divine restriction deep within.</p><p>“Lingzhuzi and the Great Shaman are there!”</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi pointed towards the Heavenly Tower. “When we entered Flower Fairy Lake, they hadn't left the Seven Killing Hall yet.  Everything seems normal now, so they should still be in the Heavenly Tower. Last time, the Demon Lord and the Great Shaman fought a great battle over treasures, turning the Seven Killing Hall upside down…”</p><p>Nine-Phoenix King's eyes were like lightning as she stared at the Heavenly Tower for a long time, coldly saying, “It’s not yet time to contact the two clans' Yuan Ying cultivators.  You will protect me.”</p><p>After speaking, Nine-Phoenix King landed on a clear space, sitting cross-legged.</p><p>The demons, unsure of what to do, silently dispersed, standing around Nine-Phoenix King, vigilant.</p><p>Nine-Phoenix King waved her hand, setting up several enchantments. She took out a glass bead the size of a baby's fist, raising her palm, allowing the bead to float before her. Then, Nine-Phoenix King’s hand seals changed rapidly, her fingers moving like a wheel, quickly sending out incantations into the bead.</p><p>The glass bead vibrated, humming, its light shining brightly.</p><p>The enchantments sealed off the bead’s changes.</p><p>A shocking scene unfolded: Nine-Phoenix King opened her mouth and spat out a mouthful of refined blood onto the glass bead.</p><p>Instantly, the blood was absorbed by the bead. Then, the runes inside the bead danced wildly, dazzling the eyes.  Gazing at it for a moment gave one the feeling of being sucked into the bead's depths.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the bead, noticing a faint connection between it and Nine-Phoenix King. Even if it wasn't a lifebound treasure, it must have been nurtured by Nine-Phoenix King for many years to have such a deep connection.</p><p>After a moment, the glass bead gradually stopped vibrating, its internal appearance greatly changed.</p><p>Inside the glass bead, a drop of golden liquid now floated, seemingly the condensation of Nine-Phoenix King's refined blood, but not bright red, but golden.</p><p>At this time, Nine-Phoenix King's aura was much weaker than before.</p><p>She hastily took a pill, her expression solemn as she looked at the bead. Suddenly, she flicked a finger, sending a stream of light onto the bead.</p><p>With a clear *twang*, the glass bead suddenly transformed into a golden light, shooting out.</p><p>The demons were unprepared, their expressions changing slightly.  They were about to intercept it when Nine-Phoenix King waved her hand, her red lips moving slightly, chanting an incantation. The glass bead stopped in mid-air, then was caught in Nine-Phoenix King's palm.</p><p>The glass bead was still struggling.</p><p>Nine-Phoenix King slowly closed her eyes, carefully sensing for a while, a look of joy appearing on her face.  Suddenly, she turned her head to the distance and said, "Follow me!"</p><p>Having said that, Nine-Phoenix King rose on her escaping light, heading straight in that direction, slowing down to accommodate the demons.</p><p>Over mountains and valleys.</p><p>Before long, the demons arrived before a cliff face.</p><p>The glass bead in Nine-Phoenix King’s hand vibrated wildly, seemingly drawn to something within the cliff.</p><p>The cliff was damp, covered in moss and weeds, even a few old pine trees growing stubbornly from the crevices.</p><p>“Ninth Aunt, what are you looking for?”</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi asked.</p><p>“Caiyi, you two, attack there with all your might.”</p><p>Nine-Phoenix King didn’t answer, her gaze sweeping to a point on the cliff face.</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi and Gu Heng stepped forward, flying to the spot Nine-Phoenix King indicated, simultaneously letting out a low shout.</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi's body glowed with rainbow light, manifesting a seven-colored phoenix shadow.  Gu Heng's bones cracked, and sharp dragon horns sprouted from his head.</p><p>The two demons exchanged a glance and simultaneously launched a full-powered attack on the stone wall.</p><p>An ordinary stone wall would have shattered under such a violent assault.  Yet this wall remained intact, only the moss and weeds were obliterated into dust.</p><p>The true nature of the wall was revealed, a faint glow emanating from its surface, its structure undamaged.</p><p>At that moment, Jiu Feng Wang appeared before the wall, her jade hand gently pressing against it. She shouted, "Open!"</p><p>The wall trembled violently, and a passage opened up.</p><p>Moments later, the demons found themselves in an empty cave, filled with questions.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang, holding a crystal orb, stood before a wall, her head slightly tilted, gazing at the empty stone.</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi stood beside her, sensing something but hesitant to voice her suspicions.</p><p>"Do you feel a familiarity with these restrictions? This is a unique bloodline restriction of our Phoenix Clan,"</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang said to Caiyi.  "The cultivator who left this restriction was far stronger than us.  Only because its power has diminished with time, and it was previously forcibly broken, could I sense it with my secret technique."</p><p>"A Phoenix Clan bloodline restriction!"</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi was shocked. "Could this be the abode of an ancient Phoenix Clan ancestor?"</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang nodded. "It's possible.  There are likely more places like this.  The Seven Kills Hall undoubtedly contains other demon cultivators' legacies. They might have been spirit beasts tamed by human cultivators, or they may have shared origins with human cultivators, belonging to the same faction."</p><p>"Demon cultivators and human cultivators from the same faction?"</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi and the others found this hard to imagine; the demon and human cultivator races in the two great seas have always been at odds.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang calmly replied, "What's so strange about that?  The ancient cultivation world was not peaceful; demon cultivators and human cultivators weren't always adversaries."</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi suddenly realized something, exclaiming excitedly, "Ninth Aunt, this means the Seven Kills Hall isn't what the humans claim – a human sacred site. This place is actually a sacred site for our demon clan?"</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang hummed in agreement, sighing, "That may be so, but the human and witch tribes of the Canglang Sea are flourishing, while the demon clan is declining, forced to live precariously under their noses, unable to contend for the Seven Kills Hall.  Countless treasures of our demon ancestors have fallen into the hands of human cultivators, a tragic waste. If we could obtain these treasures, we might even achieve divine transformation."</p><p>The demons shared a sense of frustration.</p><p>Ironically, the Seven Kills Hall is located in the Canglang Sea, not the Demon Sea.  Having infiltrated it with great difficulty, they cannot launch a large-scale invasion of the Canglang Sea and are powerless to compete with the human cultivators.</p>
