<h1>Chapter 783: The Seventh Floor</h1><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Three consecutive sounds echoed as the triple barrier shattered. Even the bronze mirror, renowned for its defensive capabilities, couldn't withstand the impact. A crack appeared in its center, splitting it in two, its future repairability uncertain.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a searing pain throughout his body, his vision momentarily fading to black.  It felt as though he had been struck by a mountain. His True Essence surged out of control, and his protective aura nearly extinguished. Fragments of golden light, sharp as knives, and demonic energy with terrifying corrosive power, assaulted him.</p><p>Qin Sang was sent flying backward, losing the twin-headed Flood Dragon near him in the chaos.</p><p>Despite his injuries, a sense of relief washed over him.  Their combined efforts had managed to block the most potent wave of the attack. They were hurt, but at least they wouldn't die here.</p><p>After a difficult struggle, the residual energy gradually dissipated. Qin Sang, his face pale, steadied himself in the void and spotted the twin-headed Flood Dragon not far away. The creature's appearance was comical. Patches of fur were missing here and there, and its tail was completely bald. Yet, it appeared to be full of life.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang’s gaze, the Flood Dragon let out a few roars and retreated into the Hunyuan concentric rings to heal.</p><p>The old woman clutched the broken pieces of her bronze mirror, her expression dark and unreadable as she stood motionless, lost in thought.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings. The void was filled with dissipating golden light and demonic energy.  He searched for the others. The Yin Clan cultivator was nowhere to be seen.  However, in the distance, a silver light flickered within the remnants of the blast, eventually revealing the Di Clan cultivator. He had survived, though he appeared equally battered.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Su, where are you going?”  Qin Sang noticed the old couple, who after standing in a daze for a moment, had turned to leave. Surprised, he called out to them.</p><p>The old woman forced a bitter smile. “I spent years preparing for this journey," she said, her voice strained. "The two treasures I brought, crafted with immense effort and expense, were meant to protect us from the dangers within.  They’re now destroyed. Even if I continued, it would be pointless, a suicide mission.  Fortunately, I still have enough lifespan remaining to endure until the next opening of the Seven Kills Palace. I’ll take my leave now. I wish Fellow Daoist Qin success in your endeavors."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent. The treasure lay just ahead, almost within reach. Such an unexpected turn of events was unforeseen by anyone.  Had he been in their position, he wouldn’t know what to say either.</p><p>Just as the old woman was about to depart, the teleportation formation lit up again.  The Grand Sorcerer and the Demon Lord had been fighting right beside the stone platform, seemingly unconcerned about damaging it.  In reality, as the residual energy from their battle washed over the platform, a cyan light shimmered, forming a barrier that repelled the force. The clash of two late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators had failed to even scratch the platform. The teleportation formation remained intact.</p><p>The sight of the reactivated teleportation formation startled Qin Sang and the others. Like frightened birds, they instinctively retreated without a second thought.</p><p>Then, over a dozen figures emerged from the formation one after another. These individuals possessed auras only slightly weaker than the Grand Sorcerer and the Demon Lord.  They were all Nascent Soul Grandmasters!</p><p>Among them were both sorcerers and human cultivators.  As they stepped out, some immediately engaged in combat, while others summoned their flying lights and pursued their own paths.</p><p>Once these figures disappeared from view, Qin Sang and the others breathed a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>“I wonder what treasures the Nascent Soul Grandmasters found up there to cause such open conflict. Fellow Daoist Su, aren’t you curious? Perhaps there’s an opportunity.” Qin Sang turned and asked.</p><p>The old woman shook her head, bid farewell to Qin Sang, and resolutely departed.</p><p>Seeing that no other Nascent Soul Grandmasters were emerging, Qin Sang summoned his own flying light and headed towards the teleportation formation.  </p><p>Just as he was about to step onto the platform, he heard a shout from behind. The Di Clan cultivator invited him to travel together. Qin Sang, having no intention of joining forces, simply nodded and stepped onto the teleportation formation, vanishing in a flash of light.</p><p>The Di Clan cultivator reached the edge of the stone platform, frowning at the now empty formation.  He shook his head and then stepped onto it himself.</p><p>…</p><p>The Seventh Floor of the Celestial Tower.</p><p>This was the highest level accessible to cultivators from the Canglang Sea.  It was certain that the tower, with its immense height, extended beyond seven floors.</p><p>However, over the years, countless Nascent Soul Grandmasters had explored the seventh floor extensively, searching for a passage or teleportation formation leading to higher levels, but to no avail.</p><p>That was why the discovery of the ancient corpse falling from the top of the tower had caused such a sensation. Some believed that understanding the corpse held the key to unlocking the tower’s secrets, and perhaps even obtaining ancient treasures.</p><p>The first six floors could be considered testing grounds for Foundation Establishment and Core Formation cultivators.  Logically, the seventh floor should contain puppets capable of rivaling Nascent Soul Grandmasters.</p><p>But this wasn’t the case.</p><p>The seventh floor was drastically different from the previous six.  Qin Sang emerged from the teleportation formation, cautiously observing his surroundings. Seeing no other Nascent Soul Grandmasters engaged in combat nearby, he relaxed slightly and began to examine the area.</p><p>The seventh floor was also a shattered space.</p><p>However, instead of remnants of ancient halls and structures made of cyan bricks, it consisted of numerous fragments of mountain peaks, resembling small islands, floating motionless in the void.</p><p>They were clearly fragments of mountains. Some were sections of cliffs, others were isolated patches of forest, and most had stone steps traversing their surfaces. The steps could be pieced together, indicating they were once part of a whole.</p><p>These fragments weren't arranged on a single plane. They surrounded Qin Sang above, below, and on all sides, varying in size and shape.</p><p>It was as if an ancient cultivator had sealed a towering mountain within the Celestial Tower! Qin Sang couldn't fathom the level of cultivation required for such a feat.</p><p>Most of the mountain fragments were just ordinary rock and forest, devoid of any unusual qualities. Only a few exhibited signs of something special.  Some areas shimmered with the light of restrictive formations, others concealed ancient halls within their forests, and some cliffs revealed ancient cultivator caves.  Each fragment exuded an aura of mystery, both alluring and potentially dangerous.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved a map he had purchased earlier.  It was the most detailed map he could find, acquired at a hefty price. Since the space within the seventh floor was fixed, the map remained accurate.</p><p>Locating his position on the map, his gaze shifted to the top, focusing on a fragment shaped like an isolated valley.  The map offered limited annotations, and those provided had little to do with treasures.  Only a few cultivators who dared to explore the Celestial Tower had returned with any rewards, and information about these secrets rarely became public.  Qin Sang would have to explore on his own.</p><p>However, one location was clearly marked: the valley.  It was said to be the place where Nascent Soul Grandmasters believed a teleportation formation leading to higher floors was most likely hidden. However, no one had ever entered to confirm this. Not because they didn't want to, but because they couldn't.</p><p>This was Qin Sang’s first destination.  The Grand Sorcerer and the others had already left, so he could safely proceed and verify whether, as in the Ziwei Palace, the *Yuanshen Sword Raising Chapter* would open the way for him.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the map and soared into the air.</p>
