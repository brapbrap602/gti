<h1>Chapter 1948: Forbidden Book</h1><p>“Senior Shi! You’re here!”</p><p>Yu Lang’s guarded expression vanished instantly. He bowed slightly, recalling the incident a month prior and assuming the other party had come to repay his medicine debt.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi spoke gently, “You saved me once. There’s no need for such formality in the future.  Call me Brother Shi, and you can address me as Yu Lang.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Yu Lang scratched his head.</p><p>Although this young man surnamed Shi always appeared disheveled, his cultivation was undoubtedly far beyond his own.</p><p>Not one for pleasantries, Yu Lang simply replied, “Brother Shi, are your injuries healed?”</p><p>“Your master is indeed a master alchemist. A single dose of Jade Renewal Powder immediately dispersed that insidious Golden Mercury Qi. After a month of meditative recovery, my injuries are completely under control. I only need to nurture myself for a while longer to be fully healed.”</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi expressed his admiration.</p><p>Hearing this, Yu Lang couldn’t help but smile, happy for the other party and proud of his master's medical skills.</p><p>The sounds of training drills drifted in from outside the bamboo grove.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi turned his head, gazing towards the sounds beyond the bamboo, a flicker of curiosity in his eyes. “A cultivator deliberately descending the mountain to study martial arts and literature in the mortal realm is a first for me. Is this your master’s instruction?”</p><p>Cultivation naturally involved studying literature.</p><p>After embarking on the path of cultivation, one’s energy becomes abundant, and their thinking becomes agile, possessing a near-photographic memory. Studying alongside mortals at the same pace would undoubtedly be a hindrance, a waste of time.</p><p>“I wished to descend the mountain to study, and Master granted my request.” Yu Lang waved the spear in his hand. “Brother Shi, do you also understand spear techniques?”</p><p>“In my youth, I admired the carefree and unrestrained knights-errant. However, the mortal realm is monitored by Divine Authorities, forbidding the casual use of spells. So, I secretly learned martial arts, sealed my magical powers, and ventured out to uphold justice.”</p><p>Recounting his past, the young man surnamed Shi’s reminiscence carried a tinge of melancholy. Suddenly, he chuckled, “The sword is a gentleman’s weapon. When roaming the world, it certainly appears more refined and elegant than spears or staves. However, I’ve also witnessed some exceptional spear wielders. Your spear technique has surpassed most, but this particular style is meant to be a fierce and decisive killing spear. Without actual combat experience, you lack that essential aura of lethal determination.”</p><p>Yu Lang felt a pang of envy towards Brother Shi’s experiences. “When I was young, I only learned some rudimentary kung fu from my father. Now, I merely practice haphazardly.  My spear technique comes from the military formations taught by my teacher. I don't even know how to cultivate true energy into it. I wonder if I'll ever have the opportunity to descend the mountain, travel, and witness the advanced martial arts of the mortal world.”</p><p>“You truly wish to continue pursuing martial arts?”</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi looked at Yu Lang with surprise. “Aren’t you afraid of being reprimanded by your master for neglecting your cultivation?”</p><p>How could the methods of a cultivator compare to those of a mortal warrior? Why would anyone abandon the fundamental for the trivial?</p><p>Seeing Yu Lang’s slightly stiff expression, the young man surnamed Shi softened his tone. “Practicing martial arts isn't entirely useless. Back when I was in the Qi Refining stage, I often fell into perilous situations. Several times, it was the agility and quick thinking honed through martial arts that allowed me to unexpectedly turn the tables and defeat my opponents. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be seeing me here today.”</p><p>At this point, the young man surnamed Shi paused.</p><p>He could only say so much. In battles between Foundation Establishment cultivators, martial arts truly had little room to shine.</p><p>Yu Lang took a deep breath. “Brother Shi, you needn’t say more. I understand. Practicing martial arts is just to fulfill a childhood dream. Cultivation is my primary focus. I won’t lose sight of the bigger picture.”</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi nodded slightly, then suddenly smiled. “I once devoted considerable effort to creating a sword technique. I believe its ingenuity is no less than other martial arts. Later, I focused solely on cultivation and it never had a successor. Since you are interested in martial arts and you call me brother, I shall pass this sword technique on to you, ensuring it lives on. What do you say?”</p><p>Yu Lang was initially delighted, then hesitant.</p><p>Was he about to take on a third teacher?</p><p>Master Chen established a school open to all, and he wasn’t the only student there.</p><p>But martial arts were different; they were secretly transmitted, and according to the traditions of the martial world, a master and disciple were like father and son.</p><p>Moreover, this Brother Shi was no ordinary mortal. Taking him as a master wouldn't be a simple mortal connection; it would involve unforeseen karmic ties in the future.</p><p>Would Master agree?</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi saw through Yu Lang’s thoughts and said casually, “It’s just a martial art, a useless thing to us cultivators. Even if I passed on ten or eight to you, it wouldn't matter. Don’t overthink it. I see that you like it, so consider it a meeting gift, nothing more.”</p><p>“Then I’ll gratefully accept, thank you, Brother Shi!”</p><p>Casting aside his worries, Yu Lang immediately bowed deeply.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi waved his hand, isolating the bamboo grove from the outside world. A flash of sword light leaped from his spatial pouch, landing in his hand. He swung it a few times.</p><p>“My martial art is called the Monarch’s Slaying Sword Art! It comprises twenty-five sword moves and five essential techniques. Its purpose is to slay evildoers, but the sword style is righteous and dignified, always engaging enemies head-on, hence the name ‘Gentleman’s Slaying Sword.’  It earned me the moniker ‘Gentleman Sword’ in the martial world. I still remember how I originally envisioned it: By integrating all the sword moves and essential techniques, the sword art would undergo a transformation. Unfortunately, I later encountered unforeseen circumstances and lost interest, abandoning it.  If you’re inclined, you can try. Perhaps you can truly discover something new.”</p><p>“The first move: White Cloud Emerging from the Mountain!”</p><p>As the young man surnamed Shi spoke, his entire being practically transformed into a blur of sword light.</p><p>The wind howled, and bamboo leaves rustled and fell.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi danced with his sword within the grove, each move exquisite and far superior to the spear techniques taught by Master Chen.</p><p>Yu Lang’s eyes widened, listening intently to the young man surnamed Shi’s explanations, afraid to miss a single detail.</p><p>Before long, the young man surnamed Shi had demonstrated the entire Monarch’s Slaying Sword Art once and sheathed his sword.</p><p>“Have you memorized it?”</p><p>Yu Lang closed his eyes, pondered for a moment, and nodded slightly.</p><p>“Before learning this sword art, there are a few other martial arts you need to master. I created this sword art based on these foundations. The first is called the Severing River Divine Saber!”</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi used his sword as a saber, demonstrating another saber technique.</p><p>He continued demonstrating several martial arts in this manner, each requiring only a single demonstration for Yu Lang to completely memorize.</p><p>“Your aptitude is truly remarkable, but unfortunately, the martial path is not the true path.” The young man surnamed Shi shook his head and sighed, tossing the sword in his hand to Yu Lang.</p><p>“Brother, you lack a suitable sword. Take this and use it for now. This sword is considered a divine weapon in the mortal realm, but it’s actually just a low-grade magical artifact.”</p><p>Sensing the sword in his hand, Yu Lang found this to be true and didn't refuse.</p><p>Coming back to his senses, he realized it was already dusk, almost time for school to be dismissed.</p><p>Yu Lang cried out in alarm and hurried back to the schoolhouse.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi waited until Yu Lang and Xiao Wu finished their lessons and returned to the Daoist temple with them.</p><p>Along the way, the young man surnamed Shi continued recounting various martial arts, interspersed with stories from his travels in the martial world. The tales were captivating, filling Yu Lang with longing, and even Xiao Wu listened with rapt attention.</p><p>Back at the Daoist temple, the young man surnamed Shi waited until the last patient left and offered the spirit stones he owed.</p><p>He watched Qin Sang pick up a brush and erase the entry under the dim lamplight, just like a mortal Daoist priest.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi couldn't help but sigh. “I’ve only been to Qingyang Temple twice, but for some reason, every time I enter, my spirit feels an unprecedented tranquility.  It truly is a serene place. I'm almost reluctant to leave.”</p><p>Despite these words, the young man surnamed Shi soon took his leave, and Yu Lang personally escorted him out of the Daoist temple.</p><p>…</p><p>Unknowingly, the master and two disciples had already spent four years at Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qingyang Temple remained the same.</p><p>The number of people coming up the mountain for medicine had decreased, but they were traveling from farther and farther away.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously discussed with Master Chen, holding back Xiao Wu and Yu Lang for three years so they could complete their elementary studies with their peers.</p><p>According to tradition, the students should have taken the Child Examination at this point. If successful, they would become Child Scholars and could then attend the county school or other academies.</p><p>However, Master Chen's school was also considered an academy. Although he was only a scholar, he had a reputation for his talent. Many other scholars admired him and remained at the schoolhouse year-round, discussing Confucian classics, composing poems, and writing prose, treating him with respect as a teacher in private.</p><p>Some Child Scholars would only register at the county school and continue their studies at the schoolhouse.</p><p>Those who didn't pass the Child Examination, or those like Yu Lang and Xiao Wu who didn’t participate, were also placed with the Child Scholars to study more advanced classics after being assessed by Master Chen.</p><p>In fact, Xiao Wu and Yu Lang had already mastered these texts.</p><p>Master Chen often provided them with "extra lessons," even using his connections to specifically request books from the prefectural and provincial cities, especially for Yu Lang, in whom he placed high hopes.</p><p>Despite countless attempts to persuade him, Yu Lang remained steadfast in his pursuit of martial arts. Master Chen gradually gave up but didn’t neglect them because of it.</p><p>These past few years, Yu Lang's life had been fulfilling.</p><p>Since passing on the Monarch’s Slaying Sword Art to Yu Lang, the young man surnamed Shi would visit Qingyang Temple every six months or so.</p><p>He didn’t come seeking medicine.</p><p>Each visit, he would bring various mortal martial arts manuals as gifts for Yu Lang.</p><p>He himself couldn’t explain whether he was repaying this young friend or seeking that precious tranquility.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't dare linger for too long, each visit lasting no more than an hour, arriving and departing in haste.</p><p>The first clear day after a snowfall.</p><p>Yu Lang sat attentively in class, his expression shifting slightly as he glanced at his senior sister beside him.</p><p>The senior and junior disciples exchanged a knowing smile. During the break, they went together to the bamboo grove.</p><p>“Brother Shi!”</p><p>Seeing the young man surnamed Shi meditating in the bamboo grove, Yu Lang's excitement was tinged with complaint. “Why did it take you so long to come this time?”</p><p>“I can’t disturb you too often.”</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi smiled without further explanation. He looked Yu Lang up and down, sighing with emotion. “You’ve already reached the eleventh level of Qi Refining so quickly. It’s good to have a master! When do you plan to attempt the Foundation Establishment stage? Hasn't the Daoist Priest given you Foundation Establishment pills?”</p><p>“Master hasn’t mentioned it,” Yu Lang said with some distress.</p><p>After reaching the tenth level of Qi Refining, Master rarely guided him and even stopped the medicinal baths.</p><p>He wasn't sure what he should be doing.</p><p>“With your master's abilities, refining a few Foundation Establishment pills is as easy as turning his hand. He’s probably waiting for you to thoroughly refine your cultivation. You’re still young, with plenty of time.”  As the young man surnamed Shi spoke, he waved his hand, summoning a wooden table that was instantly laden with cups and dishes.</p><p>Ever since learning Xiao Wu's favorite foods, he brought delicacies from all over with each visit.</p><p>“What are you looking at? Hurry up and eat!”</p><p>Seeing Xiao Wu devouring the food while Yu Lang stared at him without moving, the young man surnamed Shi shook his head with a smile and tossed a stack of manuals towards him. “Here you go!”</p><p>“Thank you, Brother Shi!”</p><p>Yu Lang cheered, hugging the manuals to his chest, sitting down on the ground without a care for appearances, and eagerly flipping through them.</p><p>“Daoist Priest Qingfeng allows this boy to indulge in martial arts. I wonder what his intentions are.”</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi pondered silently.</p><p>He knew his arrival couldn't be hidden from the Daoist Priest's eyes.  Since even the master didn't intervene, he didn't need to say anything.</p><p>Looking again at Xiao Wu, who was chewing slowly yet consuming at a surprising pace, the young man surnamed Shi thought to himself that she was also a strange one.</p><p>Several years had passed, and she hadn't grown an inch, merely using illusion techniques to deceive mortals. She was probably not human.</p><p>Yet, he couldn’t discern Xiao Wu's true origin.</p><p>Just then, all three of them stopped what they were doing and looked up.</p><p>Qipai Village and Qinggui Town were connected by a single road.  This road had a three-way intersection, with the other path leading to the county seat as an official road.</p><p>Just now, a group of people on horseback came from the direction of the county seat.</p><p>Leading the group were several constables, followed by a squad of armored soldiers, their horses galloping like lightning.</p><p>The border of Nanshu Province was constantly at war, with troops stationed year-round, so this sight wasn't unusual.</p><p>Xiao Wu and the young man surnamed Shi had already sensed their approach and paid them no mind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the group of soldiers didn't take the official road to Qinggui Town but instead turned onto the smaller path towards Qipai Village.</p><p>“What are they doing here?”</p><p>Yu Lang was the last to notice, his brow furrowing.</p><p>The soldiers were filled with killing intent, clearly harboring malicious intentions.</p><p>‘Clatter… Clatter… Clatter…’</p><p>The rapid hoofbeats shattered the tranquility of Qipai Village.</p><p>The soldiers passed through the bamboo grove, heading straight for the schoolhouse. The lead constable, who looked to be only about twenty years old, yanked hard on the reins, his horse rearing up with a long whinny.</p><p>The armored soldiers behind him came to a halt.</p><p>Commotion erupted within the schoolhouse as the students rushed out, staring fearfully at the menacing constables.</p><p>The younger students burst into tears from fright.</p><p>Someone ran to the back room to inform Master Chen.</p><p>The young constable sneered, waving his hand sharply. “Surround them! Don't let anyone escape, or you’ll be held accountable!”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>The armored soldiers responded in unison, splitting into two groups and completely encircling the schoolhouse.</p><p>Just as they were about to charge into the schoolhouse, Master Chen finally emerged from the back room with hurried steps.</p><p>Seeing the young constable, Master Chen’s face darkened instantly. He roared, “Yue Duanshu, don't you dare! What do you think you’re doing?!”</p><p>Yue Duanshu’s sneer deepened as he raised the token in his hand high. “The prefectural office received a secret report that the scholar Chen Zhenqing, under the guise of teaching, has been secretly distributing forbidden books within the school, harboring treasonous intentions! This official has been ordered by the Vice Prefect to investigate. Search the premises! Anyone who dares to obstruct will be killed without mercy!”</p><p>Yue Duanshu held the token aloft, looking down from his horse with a self-righteous air.</p><p>“What scoundrel dares to slander me?!”</p><p>Master Chen's face was as dark as thunder.</p><p>The students were filled with righteous indignation.</p><p>Unnoticed by anyone, by the schoolhouse window, a young girl hiding behind a group of students suddenly became terrified, nearly collapsing to the ground.</p><p>She shrank back, her expression panicked, afraid to make a sound.  Her hands trembled as she quietly pulled a worn, damaged book from her satchel, her whole body shaking with fear, nearly dropping the book.</p><p>The sound of the soldiers’ footsteps was like a death knell.</p><p>At a loss, the young girl spotted a small, exquisite book box beside her and hurriedly stuffed the book inside.
