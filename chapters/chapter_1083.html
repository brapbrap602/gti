<h1>Chapter 175: Oblivion</h1><p>At the foot of Mount Ethereal Peak.</p><p>Old Devil Mu successfully escaped here, while the battle on the summit continued to rage.</p><p>His physical body had been shattered, but fortunately, his divine sense was comparable to a Grand Cultivator's.  He had exhausted his life-saving techniques, sacrificing a Fire Lotus Seed to block a fatal blow. Otherwise, his Nascent Soul would have been torn to shreds, and he would have perished on the spot.</p><p>His current state was precarious. Only a fragmented Nascent Soul remained, and the Fire Lotus Seed, painstakingly refined over countless years, was depleted.</p><p>With his cultivation level, the pressure from the Spirit Suppression Domain wasn't overwhelming. He hadn't felt it significantly before, but in his severely injured state, even this slight influence couldn't be ignored.  If his cultivation realm fell because of this, his fate would be even more tragic.</p><p>Old Devil Mu had burned his essence to conceal his escape.</p><p>"Li Furen! Four Saints Palace!"</p><p>He glared resentfully towards the mountaintop.</p><p>This collaboration with the Demon Lord had been a complete disaster, further damaging his essence.</p><p>He didn't dare seek help from the Demon Lord.</p><p>If he fell into the Demon Lord's hands, he had no doubt that his Nascent Soul would be devoured, or perhaps even refined into a demonic puppet.</p><p>After this battle, Old Devil Mu knew he could only lie low. With the Fire Lotus Seed shattered and such severe injuries, simply recovering and avoiding a drop in cultivation would be a blessing. He didn’t know how long it would take to make a comeback.</p><p>"That brat from the merchant guild..."</p><p>Old Devil Mu recalled the beginning of it all—the Nine Yin Devilfire—and gritted his teeth.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Flying low to the ground, Old Devil Mu crossed a field of fossilized grass when a sense of foreboding suddenly washed over him. A thunderclap then exploded overhead.</p><p>A bolt from the blue.</p><p>An aura of destruction descended.</p><p>"Someone's there!"</p><p>Old Devil Mu was startled.  His vision was filled with silver-white light as lightning flashed.</p><p>He had thought he'd evaded everyone and successfully escaped, but his whereabouts had already been exposed.</p><p>Despair gripped Old Devil Mu.</p><p>Due to the ancient restrictions of the Spirit Suppression Domain, his attacker must be at least at the peak of Mid-Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>While the Merchant Alliance, the Four Saints Palace, and the leaders of both the righteous and demonic factions were present at the Ancient Demon's seal, it didn't mean they were the only powerful cultivators among humans. Someone else was lurking nearby and had discovered his trail.</p><p>In his current state, he had no chance against such an opponent, who was also resorting to underhanded tactics, tracking him down to ambush him.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The lightning bolt struck Old Devil Mu's fragmented Nascent Soul directly, his movements completely within the attacker's grasp.</p><p>Even in this dire situation, Old Devil Mu refused to give up, desperately clinging to life.</p><p>He burned his essence again, teleporting to escape.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The lightning pierced through the phantom of his Nascent Soul and slammed into the ground.</p><p>A large crater formed in the field of fossilized grass, sending debris flying. The power of the lightning raged, countless electric threads and arcs flashing between the fossilized grass, instantly reducing the entire area to dust.</p><p>Old Devil Mu's fragmented Nascent Soul teleported out of the field, avoiding the direct impact of the lightning.</p><p>He was somewhat surprised. The power of the lightning bolt wasn't as strong as he had anticipated.</p><p>This thought flashed through his mind, but before he could understand why…</p><p>His fragmented Nascent Soul, having just reappeared elsewhere, suddenly felt a powerful gust of wind rushing towards him. A point of blue light rapidly expanded in his vision.</p><p>Bai was close to Qin Sang, shielded by gray Qi within a small area, unaffected by the Spirit Suppression Domain.</p><p>Bai had already prepared the Star Conch and, accurately predicting Old Devil Mu's teleportation destination, immediately launched it, giving him no chance to recover.</p><p>Both were understandably tense. If their judgment was wrong and the ambush failed, they were ready to flee at any moment.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Star Conch spun, carrying an extreme sharpness.</p><p>Old Devil Mu's fragmented Nascent Soul, its energy yet to recover, could only raise a weak hand in a desperate attempt to condense a thin barrier of cold flames. Before it could fully form, the Star Conch pierced through.</p><p>'Poof!'</p><p>The power of the Star Conch erupted. Unable to dodge or defend, Old Devil Mu's fragmented Nascent Soul was torn again, its aura extremely weak.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was elated. His judgment had been correct.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The light suddenly dimmed. Banners unfurled, and billowing devilfire filled the sky.</p><p>That the Star Conch hadn't killed Old Devil Mu was within Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>To ensure success, while casting the Lightning Summoning Technique, Qin Sang didn't hesitate to swallow a drop of Three Lights Jade Liquid. His internal true essence was brimming.</p><p>As long as he could eliminate Old Devil Mu, these costs were worth it.</p><p>The Devil Banner Formation was the true killing move!</p><p>Nine devil banners flew, Nine Yin Devilfire surging out, instantly engulfing the fragmented Nascent Soul.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang flashed, flying towards it on his sword.</p><p>Seeing the familiar devil flames, Old Devil Mu was first stunned, then, noticing his attacker's cultivation realm, felt a moment of disbelief, thinking he must be mistaken.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Old Devil Mu immediately realized.</p><p>This person was only at the Core Formation realm, yet could control devil flames. His true identity was now clear—it was the brat from the Qiongyu Merchant Guild, the one he had been searching for relentlessly.</p><p>At the outer hall exit, he would rather kill a thousand by mistake than let one go.</p><p>The Fire Curse Seed, chasing him for thousands of miles.</p><p>He had repeatedly escaped that brat by unknown means, yet it had resulted in his own misfortune.</p><p>Now, at his weakest moment, the brat appeared again, seeking his life!</p><p>Old Devil Mu couldn't understand how this brat, only at the Core Formation realm, could move freely within the Spirit Suppression Domain, appearing before him as if descending from the heavens.</p><p>But none of that mattered now.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The torrent of devilfire surged, breaking through the cold flames.</p><p>The Nine Yin Devilfire burned fiercely.</p><p>Having just consumed his essence for teleportation and suffering new injuries on top of old ones, Old Devil Mu was incredibly weak.  The impact of the devilfire's aura left him disoriented, unable even to self-destruct.</p><p>The devilfire engulfed his fragmented Nascent Soul. The Ebony Wood Sword transformed into a sword wheel, and Bai also urged his corpse Qi to assist, along with the restrictions of the Spirit Suppression Domain.</p><p>The fragmented Nascent Soul flickered like a dying candle.</p><p>Seeing that Old Devil Mu's Nascent Soul was shattered and he could no longer resist, Qin Sang had a thought.  He formed a single-handed seal, attempting to restrain Old Devil Mu's soul.</p><p>"You insignificant wretch, how dare you attempt to search my soul!"</p><p>The fragmented Nascent Soul coldly stared at Qin Sang, its eyes showing not resentment or anger, but only a trace of unwillingness.</p><p>Old Devil Mu, who had lived a life of reckless abandon, had long anticipated such a day. He just hadn't expected to fall at the hands of such an opponent.</p><p>The fragmented Nascent Soul closed its eyes, the last wisp of cold flame flickering unsteadily.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed an aura of desolation emanating from the fragmented Nascent Soul. The soul was fading. He sighed inwardly. These old monsters all had protective measures; the higher their realm, the more difficult it was to use soul-searching techniques.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Qin Sang urged the devilfire to incinerate the fragmented Nascent Soul and moved to retreat, wary of any final tricks Old Devil Mu might have.</p><p>Just then, he noticed an unusual point of light within the cold flame, resembling a lotus seed.</p><p>"What's this?"</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang confirmed it wasn't a self-destructing mechanism, then immediately manipulated the devilfire to form a large hand, grabbing towards it.</p><p>'Poof!'</p><p>The Winter Nether Cold Flame retreated, revealing the lotus seed, which was caught by the devilfire and brought before Qin Sang.</p><p>"Not a storage treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang swept his divine sense over it, his face showing disappointment.</p><p>"Careful! Someone's here!"</p><p>Suddenly, Bai's voice rang in his ears, making Qin Sang's eyelids twitch.</p>
