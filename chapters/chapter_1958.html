<h1>Chapter 1949 Repaying Grievance with Virtue</h1><p>“Search!”</p><p>Armored soldiers stormed into the schoolhouse, unopposed.</p><p>Despite Chen Xiucai's burning rage, with Yue Duanshu's token and warrant in hand, he dared not obstruct the doorway with his scholar status.  Otherwise, Yue Duanshu would have legitimate grounds to accuse him of hindering official business.</p><p>Yue Duanshu looked down upon Chen Xiucai, his eyes full of mockery, seemingly anticipating such a reaction.</p><p>Chen Xiucai's heart burned with fury; his lips trembled, and his eyes were bloodshot. He thought his years of seclusion in Qipai Village, and his repeated failures in the imperial examinations, had tempered his spirit.  Yet, faced with this situation, he realized he was far from his teacher's level of composure.</p><p>Yue Duanshu wasn't the only official present. Behind him stood several others, including the magistrate of Jin County. </p><p>Ordinarily, the magistrate treated Chen Xiucai with utmost courtesy, even addressing him as "brother" during convivial drinking sessions. Today, however, he offered no greeting, his gaze shifty, avoiding Chen Xiucai's eyes.</p><p>The county recorder and other officials behind him were as silent as cicadas in winter, their eyes fixed on the sky.</p><p>Apart from the inner chambers where Chen Xiucai's family resided, the schoolhouse was divided into two main sections.</p><p>Younger students studied in the front house.</p><p>Yulang and his peers, having completed their basic studies, had moved to the bamboo tower adjacent to the front house, a location with a more scenic view.</p><p>Currently, both the front house and the bamboo tower were surrounded by armored soldiers, preventing anyone from entering or exiting.</p><p>The students in the courtyard were herded together by the soldiers, on the verge of being searched.</p><p>A squad of soldiers charged up the bamboo tower. The students inside scrambled to the corners, trembling with fear.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The bamboo door was kicked open. Soldiers burst in, immediately ransacking the place.</p><p>“Bring out all the books! I want to see to whom this Chen has passed on the *Golden Mirror of Statecraft*! Daring to secretly disseminate forbidden texts of the current dynasty, he courts death!”</p><p>A middle-aged man with the air of an official followed, stroking his beard with a sinister sneer.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Book chests and satchels were flung open, scattering belongings across the floor. The books within were placed one by one on the table.</p><p>The middle-aged official’s gaze, sharp as knives, swept over the students' faces. Under such scrutiny, they flinched and cowered.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The middle-aged official paced, pretending to examine the books on the table, but made a beeline for a specific bamboo desk.</p><p>Witnessing his actions, the young woman who had previously hidden the book couldn't suppress her terror and shrieked.</p><p>“It wasn’t me! I don’t have the *Golden Mirror of Statecraft*! I haven’t read it!”</p><p>“It’s her! It’s Xiaowu! I saw it in her book chest! I saw her reading the *Golden Mirror of Statecraft*!”</p><p>“It’s her! Not me!”</p><p>…</p><p>The young woman huddled in the corner, one finger pointing at Xiaowu’s bamboo desk, the other clutching her head, shaking frantically.</p><p>Her hair dishevelled, she resembled a madwoman, evidently terrified to the extreme.</p><p>Distributing forbidden texts was a grave crime in the Yan Kingdom, punishable by beheading or even the extermination of three generations.</p><p>She had merely borrowed the book out of curiosity after hearing a friend could procure it.  She never imagined it would attract the attention of the prefectural guards.</p><p>The young woman didn't have the presence of mind to consider any underlying schemes. Even if she named her source, she wouldn't escape severe punishment.</p><p>The screams reached the courtyard. Chen Xiucai and the Jin County officials froze.</p><p>Chen Xiucai felt as if doused with ice water, instantly chilled to the bone. In disbelief, he instinctively rushed towards the bamboo tower.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Yue Duanshu blocked Chen Xiucai’s path with his horse, lashing his whip and snarling, “Chen Zhenqing, what are you doing?!”</p><p>“Do you intend to destroy evidence in front of me?”  Yue Duanshu rested a hand on the saber at his waist, murder in his eyes.</p><p>It was as if he would draw his blade and kill if Chen Xiucai took another step.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Chen Xiucai’s eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>By now, how could he not see that this was a conspiracy, a plot designed to ruin him, perhaps even cost him his life!</p><p>Inside the bamboo tower:</p><p>The students stared at the young woman in shock.</p><p>“Oh? Is this it?”</p><p>The middle-aged official didn't care who owned the forbidden book. As long as it was found in Chen Zhenqing's school, on one of his students, that was enough!</p><p>“It’s her! It’s her!”</p><p>“She's a Daoist! Her master is the demonic Daoist from Qingyang Temple! He must be dissatisfied with the court’s control, collecting forbidden texts to deceive the masses…”</p><p>“It must be so! It must be so!”</p><p>“It’s them!”</p><p>The young woman’s accusations grew increasingly confident, almost convincing herself of her own lies.</p><p>This woman, in such a short time, had grasped the situation and decisively framed her classmate, demonstrating a ruthless decisiveness.</p><p>The middle-aged official smiled, bypassing the young woman's desk and reaching for Xiaowu's book chest.</p><p>…</p><p>In the bamboo grove:</p><p>Xiaowu hung her head.</p><p>In her hand, a yellowed book had appeared – the forbidden *Golden Mirror of Statecraft*.</p><p>“Senior Sister…”</p><p>Yulang looked at Xiaowu with heartache.</p><p>There weren't many girls studying at the schoolhouse.  Although the Yan Kingdom didn't strictly enforce segregation of the sexes, men and women maintained a certain distance to avoid gossip.</p><p>To be betrayed by a close friend, so readily framed, Yulang felt the pain on behalf of his senior sister.</p><p>“Hmph! Truly, one cannot judge a book by its cover.  Such a venomous heart at such a young age!  You needn’t concern yourselves. Kill her with a single sword stroke. In the world of cultivation, treacherous individuals are countless. You'll encounter them frequently!”</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi sneered. He'd witnessed far dirtier deeds and didn't consider this a matter of importance.</p><p>Without needing Master Qingfeng’s intervention, Xiaowu could crush all the mortals present with a single finger.</p><p>This laughable framing wouldn't harm a hair on her head.</p><p>As he spoke, the young man surnamed Shi noticed something amiss with Xiaowu.</p><p>She sat there, staring blankly at the *Golden Mirror of Statecraft* in her hand, motionless.</p><p>Frowning, the young man asked in surprise, “What’s wrong? Can you not bring yourself to do it?”</p><p>Yulang said in a low voice, “Meng Yusu is Senior Sister’s best friend.”</p><p>The young man scoffed, “Consider this: If you were not a cultivator, but an ordinary mortal, what would happen today? Possessing forbidden texts is a capital crime everywhere! Not only would you face death, but your junior brother, your master, they would all be implicated, executed for public display! Regardless of past affection, it should end here.  This is a blood feud!”</p><p>Yulang opened his mouth, unsure what to say.</p><p>Xiaowu finally raised her head, her expression dazed. She turned slightly towards Qingyang Temple.</p><p>At Qingyang Temple:</p><p>There were no patients at that moment.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged, standing on a rock beside the temple, gazing at the bamboo grove below.</p><p>Master and disciple looked at each other across the bamboo grove.</p><p>Xiaowu's eyes remained tightly shut, her eyelids fluttering.</p><p>Her expression was full of helplessness, seeking guidance from her master on what to do.</p><p>But Qin Sang was a ruthless master.  He watched Xiaowu silently, offering no direction.</p><p>Then, footsteps approached the temple.  Another person seeking treatment was ascending the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and descended from the rock.</p><p>Xiaowu watched until Qin Sang and the patient disappeared within the temple gates…</p><p>"In the cultivation world, indecisiveness and mercy are grave taboos! I truly don't understand how your master taught you!"</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi was puzzled.</p><p>"It seems you've only learned quietude and virtuous conduct from your master.</p><p>"The so-called sage books you read are all censored, filled with empty talk of benevolence and righteousness.</p><p>"Perhaps your master hasn't taught you that the cultivation world demands spirit. Suppressing one's nature not only hinders the flow of thoughts but also invites bullying.</p><p>"To avenge a grievance is an immutable principle of the universe!</p><p>"Didn't the ancient sages also say:  How can one repay virtue with virtue if one repays grievance with virtue?"</p><p>Every word pierced Xiaowu’s heart.</p><p>Her eyelids trembled violently as scenes flashed through her mind.</p><p>When she first entered the schoolhouse, Meng Yusu was the first to greet her, inviting her to play games.</p><p>Studying together, reciting poems together, being scolded by their teacher together.</p><p>Playing by the river when the water rose.</p><p>Being invited to Meng Yusu’s home during the New Year to savor delicacies and share treasured possessions.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Yusu even taught her how to apply rouge.</p><p>Xiaowu had a good memory, able to recall every scene vividly. She had been subtly changed by them.</p><p>Finally, these scenes vanished, settling on a single moment.</p><p>Her master’s words: “We don’t kill.  We only save.”</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>Flames erupted from her palm, reducing the *Golden Mirror of Statecraft* to ashes.</p><p>Xiaowu burned the book, sitting there motionless, her choice made.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi closed his mouth. He'd said enough.</p><p>For some reason, he suddenly felt a sense of disillusionment.</p><p>He stood up, dusting his clothes.  "By your master’s side, you'll receive the best protection. Whatever you do will be right. But you’ll understand eventually. I hope that day isn't too cruel."</p><p>He tapped his foot and vanished without a trace.</p><p>Standing on the hillside, he glanced at the bamboo grove, then at Qingyang Temple, and finally at the vast blue sky.</p><p>After a long silence, he sighed, donned a mask, and his figure dissolved into nothingness.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the bamboo tower:</p><p>“Nothing!”</p><p>The middle-aged official shook out the books from the chest, but didn’t find the *Golden Mirror of Statecraft*.  He glared fiercely at Meng Yusu.</p><p>Meng Yusu was dumbfounded. She had clearly placed the book in the chest herself. How could it vanish?</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The middle-aged official ripped open Meng Yusu’s satchel.  It too lacked the *Golden Mirror of Statecraft*.  His expression changed drastically, a sense of foreboding washing over him. He frantically searched everywhere.</p><p>“Nothing!”</p><p>“Nothing here either!”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The middle-aged official practically turned the bamboo tower upside down, growing increasingly panicked, sweat beading on his forehead.</p><p>Footsteps echoed from below.</p><p>The officials escorted Chen Xiucai upstairs, intent on witnessing the evidence firsthand.</p><p>Yue Duanshu’s triumphant smile froze when he saw the scene within the bamboo tower.</p><p>Moments later, his furious roar echoed through the tower.</p><p>‘Thump! Thump! Thump!’</p><p>Yue Duanshu stormed downstairs with the officials, immediately making for the inner courtyard.</p><p>“Search inside!”</p><p>This time, Chen Xiucai didn't retreat. He raised a long spear, barring their way, roaring in fury, “If any of you dare take another step, I, Chen, will fight you to the death!”</p><p>The magistrate of Jin County stroked his beard, his gaze flickering. He coughed lightly.</p><p>“Ahem!  The Vice Prefect's warrant specifically mentions searching only the schoolhouse. For Master Yue to disturb Chen Xiucai’s family seems improper. Please reconsider.”</p><p>The magistrate stepped forward, whispering, “Master Yue, do not forget that Chen Xiucai was a student of Master Sun, who was once the Assistant Grand Secretary. Although he's been demoted to Qi Prefecture for years, it's said he remains in the Emperor's favor.  What if…”</p><p>“Insolence! A petty county official dares to discuss court affairs! How many heads do you have?!”</p><p>Yue Duanshu resembled a gambler who had lost everything, even more enraged because he didn't know how he lost.</p><p>His eyes bloodshot, he vented his fury on the magistrate.</p><p>Among the armored soldiers, there were two distinct styles of armor. The superior armor belonged to Yue Duanshu’s men, while the rest were Jin County soldiers.</p><p>If the magistrate hadn't kept him occupied, and if all his men hadn’t been closely watched, he would have had a hundred ways to fabricate evidence against Chen Zhenqing.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the magistrate refused to yield, waving his sleeve and ordering his soldiers to protect the inner courtyard.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Yue Duanshu finally regained a sliver of reason, staring fixedly at the magistrate and Chen Xiucai.</p><p>“Good! Very good!”</p><p>“The demonic Daoist on the mountain hides forbidden books, spreading heretical teachings and deceiving the masses!  Men!”</p><p>“No! Master Qingfeng is a virtuous Daoist, administering medicine and saving countless lives!  Magistrate…” Chen Xiucai cried out in alarm, pleading with the magistrate.</p><p>The magistrate pretended not to hear. He knew Yue Duanshu was acting out of spite and wouldn't offend him further for the sake of a Daoist he’d never met.</p><p>A group of officials stormed towards the temple, quickly reaching the gate.</p><p>Those inside sensed something amiss.</p><p>The person seeking medicine trembled with fear.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared oblivious, calmly taking the patient's pulse.</p><p>Yue Duanshu was about to give the order when the thunder of hooves echoed as someone galloped up the mountain, shouting.</p><p>“Master Yue! Master Yue!  Orders from the Prefect!”</p><p>Everyone turned to see a rider approaching at breakneck speed, waving a letter.</p><p>The rider’s horsemanship was superb, navigating the treacherous mountain path with ease.  Reaching them, he dismounted, handed the letter to Yue Duanshu, and scanned the crowd.</p><p>“This must be Master Chen! I am Qi Yueling.  Greetings, Master Chen!”  The rider unexpectedly bowed to Chen Xiucai.</p><p>“You flatter me!  General Qi, this is too much!”</p><p>Chen Xiucai hastily stepped aside as Qi Yueling leaned in and whispered, “Not at all! Not at all! Master, you are unaware, but the Assistant Grand Secretary has been reinstated…”</p><p>Though spoken softly, everyone heard it.</p><p>Yue Duanshu's hands trembled as he unfolded the letter, his face ashen.</p><p>The magistrate’s heart leaped with joy, wanting to laugh aloud. He had gambled correctly!</p><p>Looking at the stunned Chen Xiucai, Qi Yueling was immensely satisfied. He glanced at his beloved horse, glad he cared for it even more than his wife.  It had proven reliable at a crucial moment!</p><p>This journey had been divinely assisted, covering three days' travel in a single day.</p><p>He didn't know, however, that down below, Yu Chenghuang and other ghosts and spirits sighed in relief, wiping nonexistent sweat from their brows.</p><p>Knowing these people were targeting Chen Xiucai, they sensed trouble and immediately reported to the City God.</p><p>Fortunately, the mortal prefecture had issued a warrant, rectifying the situation. Otherwise, the ghosts and spirits of Jin County, even at the risk of diminishing their cultivation, would have intervened to remove the trouble for Master Qingfeng.</p><p>To ensure the timely delivery of the warrant, the rider's journey had been incredibly smooth.</p><p>River gods steered his boat, mountain gods guided his horse. He truly had divine assistance.</p><p>They hadn't failed in their crucial task! (End of Chapter)</p>
