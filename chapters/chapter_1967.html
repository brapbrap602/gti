<h1>Chapter 1958: The Top Scholar</h1><p>“A teahouse?”</p><p>Yu Lang had thought his senior sister was going to open a medical clinic.  “A teahouse is fine. The capital is a mixed bag.  If your medical skills are too impressive, it’s easy to attract unwanted attention and disturb the peace.”</p><p>They gradually approached the capital city.</p><p>The tall and imposing city walls were awe-inspiring. The immense shadow cast by the walls loomed over the passersby, like a ferocious beast swallowing everyone who entered, yet forever remaining unsatiated.</p><p>The senior sister and brother removed their Taoist robes and changed into ordinary clothes, blending into the crowd.</p><p>The fine horses they rode attracted considerable attention.  However, being under the emperor's very eyes, no one dared to cause trouble.</p><p>They entered the city without incident. After exploring the city and experiencing its unique atmosphere, they headed straight for the Tao family residence.</p><p>Living in the capital was not easy, but the Tao family was a prominent and wealthy household, resplendent and luxurious.</p><p>Their residence, located in Anye Quarter, was considered one of the city’s most prestigious areas, home to several noble families' mansions, showcasing the Tao family's extraordinary commercial success.</p><p>The two announced themselves upon arriving at the Tao residence.</p><p>The gatekeeper, already informed, immediately notified the steward, warmly saying, "Master Yu Lang and Miss Xiao Wu? The eldest master is not at home, but he instructed us to let you both stay in his courtyard."</p><p>The Tao estate was vast, with an internal garden where scenery shifted with every step, effectively shielding the bustling city noise.</p><p>The steward led them, pointing out the scenic features along the way.</p><p>"The eldest master also specifically instructed that you two may freely enter and browse any books in the Tao family library.  No one will disturb you during your stay," the steward said.</p><p>Yu Lang thought to himself, Tao Teng truly understands me.</p><p>The steward continued, "If you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to ask. The eldest master has commanded that the Tao family will do everything in its power to meet your every need!"</p><p>Yu Lang glanced at Xiao Wu. "We want to lease a teahouse.  Do you have any recommendations, sir?"</p><p>"A teahouse?"</p><p>The steward was slightly taken aback, pondering for a moment. "Most of the Tao family's properties are located in Guangwei, Anshan, and Yankang Quarters, and could be converted into teahouses. Do you have any preferences?"</p><p>Judging from the eldest master's attitude towards these two, the steward could guess that they were no ordinary individuals.</p><p>Their intention in opening a teahouse was certainly not for profit.</p><p>"Not too big, not too small; not too many, not too few customers; not overly refined, accessible to all walks of life, but not excessively noisy.  We'd like to hire a couple of storytellers, leading a simple life…"</p><p>This was Xiao Wu's request, relayed by Yu Lang.</p><p>"I understand. I will select a few of the most suitable properties and bring them to you for your choice!"</p><p>The steward acted swiftly. After settling them in Tao Teng's courtyard, he immediately took his leave. The following morning, he arrived by carriage to take them to view the properties.</p><p>The steward presented four properties.  At the first location, Xiao Wu fell in love instantly.</p><p>It was rare in the capital to find a place with such beautiful scenery.</p><p>Several renowned lakes existed within the city walls.  One, known as Jade Waist Lake, aptly named for its shape resembling a woman's graceful waist, was captivating.</p><p>This Tao family property was a two-story wooden building on the shores of Jade Waist Lake, extending partly over the water.  A small courtyard was adjacent, offering stunning views.</p><p>The lake was frequented by many visitors, ensuring a steady flow of customers.</p><p>Crucially, Jade Waist Lake's location was ideal.  Its upper reaches were in Xuanren Quarter, a high-class residential area for officials, while its lower reaches were in Chang'an Quarter, a commoner's district. The building was situated in the mid-lower reaches, making it accessible to all without being too intimidating for ordinary people.</p><p>Yu Lang was also very pleased. "It's not far from the Imperial College, although I can't often come to help my senior sister.  Once I enter the government, I might even need a disguise to come here.  Shi Gege gave me some books on disguise techniques; they are quite ingenious."</p><p>"This was originally a chess club; it only requires minor renovations. I'll have it done immediately. It should be completed within three days."</p><p>The steward was in the know.  The building, outwardly a chess club, secretly served as a place for the Tao family to entertain important guests.</p><p>But since the eldest master had ordered it, and the Tao family elders had tacitly approved, whatever its previous use, it had to change.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Yu Lang stopped the steward, taking out several gold ingots.  "Is this enough to buy this property?"</p><p>"This… I am acting on the eldest master's orders.  It should have been given to you…"</p><p>The steward looked troubled.</p><p>"It's Tao family property," Yu Lang said.</p><p>The steward immediately understood.  They had a connection with the eldest master but didn't want to owe the Tao family any favors.</p><p>Someone who could casually produce several gold ingots couldn't be an ordinary person.</p><p>Sometimes, favors aren't that easy to sell.</p><p>That evening.</p><p>The chess club was empty. All the maids had moved out.  By the third day, it was renovated and had a new sign.</p><p>“A teahouse sounds better.  But it's too elegant.”</p><p>Qingyang Tea House, how strange! Haha... Senior Sister, will Master be angry?”</p><p>Yu Lang looked at the sign, almost laughing out loud. Turning his head, he found his Senior Sister already behind the counter, fully in character.</p><p>From now on, she would be the proprietress.</p><p>The storyteller, the waiters, and even the handymen, as well as the tea, charcoal, and sweets, were all handled by the Tao family, leaving them worry-free.</p><p>“Huh? When did this place become a tea house?”</p><p>“I remember it used to be a mysterious chess club; ordinary people weren't allowed in.”</p><p>“Let's go! Let's take a look...”</p><p>…</p><p>The tea house, with its new sign, quickly attracted a stream of customers. Seeing that the prices were reasonable, the storyteller was quite entertaining, and there was an unusual female proprietor, they found seats.</p><p>Gradually, the place was almost full.</p><p>Xiao Wu handled things; initially a little clumsy, she soon became adept.</p><p>The storyteller's tales weren't particularly gripping, but the tea patrons sipped their tea, chatted amongst themselves, occasionally listening attentively to a passage, enjoying themselves.</p><p>Yu Lang helped out for a while, then sat behind the counter, the sounds of the patrons' conversations reaching his ears.</p><p>After listening with interest for a while, Yu Lang said, “Senior Sister, I know why you opened this tea house. How did you come up with the idea?”</p><p>Xiao Wu softly replied, “Many years ago, on a riverboat, Master was treating someone.  The payment was their stories, and I listened from the side.  There were so many then, many I didn't understand.”</p><p>“Interesting, but ultimately they were other people's stories…”</p><p>Yu Lang hesitated, “Senior Sister, don’t you want to have your own story?”</p><p>“My own story?”</p><p>Xiao Wu gazed dreamily at the tea house patrons.</p><p>“You could try leaving your own story in the mortal world. For example, starting by diligently running a tea house,” Yu Lang suggested.</p><p>The ways of the world, the ways of the world.</p><p>Experience life, understand people.</p><p>After that sudden betrayal and framing, Senior Sister hadn't withdrawn from the world, but she had subtly closed off her emotions.</p><p>Yu Lang himself was still naive, unable to directly guide his Senior Sister on an emotional level, so he could only suggest she start small and let changes happen naturally.</p><p>Coming to the capital was an opportunity.</p><p>Xiao Wu said, “When we left the mountain, Master told me I could try suppressing my cultivation and live as a true ordinary person.”</p><p>Yu Lang excitedly exclaimed, “Master said that too? Master's insight is impeccable, it must have a deeper meaning.  Are you going to do that, Senior Sister?”</p><p>Xiao Wu was silent for a moment, then nodded, “There are many cultivators in the capital. You need to be careful.”</p><p>“A prosperous capital naturally has its share of greedy cultivators, but with the City God and the other spirits protecting the city, they can't cause much trouble. I’ll be mingling with ordinary people, avoiding any conflict with them. Senior Sister, don't worry! Besides, before entering the city, I left a mark. Shi Ge will see it and come find us,” Yu Lang said confidently.</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded, raised her right hand, and tapped her index finger to her forehead.</p><p>Vaguely, Yu Lang seemed to see a vast darkness, within which a magnificent crown flashed before disappearing. The change was so rapid that he wondered if he was hallucinating.</p><p>He rubbed his eyes. His Senior Sister had returned to normal, now counting on an abacus.</p><p>Externally unchanged, but Yu Lang felt that an indescribable change had occurred within his Senior Sister. Only her outward appearance remained; internally, she had no cultivation left.</p><p>Just then, an unusual guest walked in.</p><p>Yu Lang's expression tightened, and he quickly stood.</p><p>Xiao Wu remained bent over, diligently calculating, not out of disdain, but because, like everyone else in the tea house, she couldn’t see him.</p><p>“Could you be the Day-Shift God?”</p><p>Yu Lang bowed. He could tell the other was a spirit, but couldn't discern their cultivation, only judging by their attire.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>The Day-Shift God glanced at Xiao Wu, confirming she was an ordinary person, and paid her no further attention.  “On the day you entered the city, a Yama should have visited to inform you of the city’s taboos. However, seeing you enter the Tao estate, they didn't dare intrude.”</p><p>“Your Excellency is wise. I would never break the rules.  Daoist Tao Teng invited me to the capital. He is currently investigating the people's concerns; upon his return, we will together pay our respects to the City God.”</p><p>Yu Lang replied neither humbly nor arrogantly.</p><p>The Day-Shift God grunted, “In that case, I won't restrict you further, leaving it to the City God’s decision. However, if you violate any rules in the meantime, I will still have you expelled from the city.”</p><p>“I understand!”</p><p>Yu Lang called over a waiter, instructing him, “Send the best tea and pastries to the upstairs private room…”</p><p>“No need!”</p><p>The Day-Shift God turned and left.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flew by, and three months passed.</p><p>Tao Teng wrote that he would return during the announcement of the imperial examinations results to meet the new scholars, but was a step behind.</p><p>Returning to the capital, Tao Teng didn't even go home but went straight to the tea house to see Yu Lang.</p><p>"You've really decided to take the imperial examination?"</p><p>Tao Cheng was somewhat incredulous, never expecting Yu Lang's descent to be so complete.</p><p>"Indeed.  In three years, I hope to be among the successful candidates," Yu Lang smiled, a powerful confidence shining through his expression.</p><p>"With your talent, brother, even the top spot is within reach! Wonderful!" Tao Cheng paced excitedly. "While you pursue a scholarly career, I'll seek a position in the Imperial Guard. We'll support the Crown Prince, one with the pen, the other with the sword!"</p><p>"I haven't even met the Crown Prince yet," Yu Lang shook his head.</p><p>"True, we should arrange an introduction. Let's see if my judgment is sound. But first, we need to go to the City God Temple. No time to waste, let's go now!"</p><p>Tao Cheng, ever impatient, pulled Yu Lang along.</p><p>Reaching the City God Temple, they were immediately stopped by temple officials. After announcements, they were led through the boundary between the living and the dead to meet the City God.</p><p>In the grand hall, the City God sat high above, surveying them.</p><p>His immense authority compelled instinctive submission.</p><p>Tao Cheng dared not be presumptuous, and Yu Lang also felt the pressure, but remained composed.  His master hadn't possessed such overwhelming authority, yet he felt that the lord of Yan's spirits lacked something compared to him.</p><p>Tao Cheng, respectfully, explained their purpose, requesting the City God's permission for Yu Lang to enter the imperial service.</p><p>Silence fell upon the hall.</p><p>Tao Cheng's heart pounded; if the City God refused, their efforts would be in vain.</p><p>Finally, the City God spoke.</p><p>"Granted!"</p><p>His deep voice resonated through the hall, like rolling thunder.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A beam of white light flew towards Yu Lang.  "Take this jade pendant. Do not misuse your spiritual energy, or it will be reclaimed, and you will be banished from the mortal realm!  Those who use magic to harm others will be punished according to the law. Do you understand?"</p><p>"I understand!"</p><p>Yu Lang solemnly accepted the pendant.</p><p>Now, like his senior sister, he was a mortal once more.</p><p>"Leave!"</p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, the City God gently propelled them from the hall.  They returned to the world of the living, escorted by the temple officials.</p><p>Back in the bustling marketplace, Tao Cheng noticed Yu Lang standing still, gazing at the temple.</p><p>"What are you thinking about?" Tao Cheng nudged Yu Lang.</p><p>"It was too easy."</p><p>Yu Lang examined the jade pendant in his hand, identical to Tao Cheng's. It concealed the aura of a cultivator and served as a means of surveillance.</p><p>"Easy is good, isn't it? It's getting late, let's return to the residence!" Tao Cheng was puzzled.</p><p>Yu Lang frowned, walking on, whispering, "The City God only saw me once, didn't test my character or scholarship, and readily allowed a cultivator into the mortal world."</p><p>"You really think it was that simple?" Tao Cheng rolled his eyes. "Without Master's influence, do you think any other cultivator could enter the court?"</p><p>"I just feel something is off. Maybe I'm overthinking."</p><p>Yu Lang glanced back, shaking his head slightly. Then, he remembered something. "When shall we visit Master?"</p><p>"Master prefers not to be disturbed while in seclusion. We can visit another time."</p><p>…</p><p>Seasons turned.</p><p>Unknowingly, the siblings spent three years in the capital.</p><p>On this day, the Qingyang Tea House was closed.  Its owner, along with countless others in the capital, gathered before the Xuande Gate of the Imperial Palace, awaiting the announcement of the imperial examination results.</p><p>"The top scholar is here! The top scholar is here!"</p><p>"It's Qin Yu Lang from Nan Shu Prefecture!"</p><p>"The top scorer in all three examinations!"</p><p>…</p><p>'Bang bang bang!'</p><p>Cannon fire echoed through the sky, accompanied by celebratory music.  After a brief lull, a tremendous roar erupted.  Armored guards led the procession, the new top scholar, adorned in celebratory finery, riding a fine steed, slowly appearing before the crowd.</p><p>Truly, he was riding on the crest of success.</p><p>The celebratory procession was customary after each imperial examination.  Behind the top scholar, other successful candidates rode horses or walked, all beaming with joy.  Only the top scholar himself appeared calm, seemingly lost in thought, as if detached from the moment.</p><p>Suddenly, he spotted a familiar figure in the crowd, his face finally breaking into a radiant smile.</p><p>"Well done!"</p><p>The crowd responded with thunderous applause.</p><p></p>
