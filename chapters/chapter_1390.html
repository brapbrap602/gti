<h1>Chapter 1382: The Ice Ritual</h1><p>Wa Yu opened his mouth, wanting to say something more.</p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>The cave's barrier opened, and a rat demon pushed the door open and came out.</p><p>The rat demon's appearance was similar to an ordinary rat, but the size difference was too great.</p><p>This rat demon was as big as a calf, with strong limbs, and its fur was a neon color, as if there was always light flowing.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat was thus named.</p><p>The rat demon's eyes darted around, with an undeniable weakness and fatigue.</p><p>Bi Fang and the other demons all looked towards the cave. Seeing the rat demon, they all showed joy.</p><p>However, after seeing the rat demon's condition,</p><p>A male and a female demon king's expressions darkened. They exchanged a glance, and their figures flashed, appearing on either side of the rat demon, like two bodyguards, subtly guarding against the other three demons.</p><p>Jiao Hu smiled slyly, extremely alluring.</p><p>Wa Yu's eyes flashed with displeasure.</p><p>Bi Fang, however, seemed not to notice, his expression unchanged as he looked at the rat demon and asked with concern, "Rainbow Daoist! How are your injuries?"</p><p>"One day, I will avenge this! Cough cough…"</p><p>The rat demon looked towards the direction of the Crescent Moon Realm, hate surging in its eyes.</p><p>Its voice was like that of a very old man, its breath weak.</p><p>After coughing a few times, the rat demon's hate subsided. Turning to Bi Fang, it said softly, "Daoist, rest assured, this king won't die for now! However, I need to rest for a while before I can complete the magical power and fully transform my secondary body into my main body. During this period, I can only appear in my demon form, my cultivation will be greatly restricted, and it will be inconvenient to act. I can only trouble you all."</p><p>Bi Fang breathed a sigh of relief and pressed, "Can Daoist first find the hiding place of the Xuan Tian Palace traitor? I'm afraid that person has already escaped this sea area."</p><p>Unexpectedly, the rat demon gently shook its head and chuckled bitterly, "Using that secret technique consumed a great deal of energy. In my current state, I can't afford it. I need at least a few days of rest to recover…"</p><p>Seeing Bi Fang and the other demons showing disappointment, the rat demon paused, "Don't worry, fellow Daoists. He was severely injured several times by me, and this time he's practically at the end of his rope, near death. If it hadn't been for Shen's unexpected interference, ruining things, I would have already captured him! Now, he must be hiding to recover from his injuries, he can't have run too far. I can vaguely sense him somewhere in the nearby sea area. Once I recover some of my cultivation, I'll immediately find him."</p><p>Bi Fang and Jiao Hu exchanged glances, worriedly saying, "I'm afraid that Old Man Feng and Shen will find him first! They actually planned in advance to ambush Rainbow Daoist. They may have already discovered something."</p><p>Rainbow Rat knew what Bi Fang was afraid of and sneered, "My main body was surrounded, and feeling that escape was hopeless, I decisively self-destructed, preventing them from succeeding."</p><p>At this time, the female demon king beside Rainbow Rat interjected, "Daoist Bi Fang, don't worry. The Xuan Tian Palace traitor is skilled in concealment techniques, not so easily caught. Even with Rainbow Daoist taking action personally, it would take a great deal of effort to confirm the person's hiding place."</p><p>Hearing this, Bi Fang's expression eased slightly, and he consoled, "Rainbow Daoist suffered greatly! Once this matter is settled, we will definitely help Daoist get revenge!"</p><p>Rainbow Rat remained noncommittal and turned back into the cave.</p><p>The demon kings could only continue waiting.</p><p>…</p><p>Unknown Space.</p><p>Darkness enveloped everything.</p><p>In the depths of the darkness, a faint blue fluorescence flickered.</p><p>This seemed to be underground.</p><p>Where the fluorescence shone, one could see an irregular black stone wall, with protruding rocks, jagged and covered with a layer of frost.</p><p>The chill emanated from the blue fluorescence.</p><p>Four ice pillars stood on the ground, positioned in four directions, each one as tall as a person, covered with runes, the fluorescence emanating from the runes.</p><p>In the middle of the four ice pillars, the chill condensed into a huge block of ice.</p><p>The white ice block floated above the ground. In the middle of the ice block, a person lay, sealed within the ice, motionless.</p><p>The person wore white clothes, their face pale and bloodless, without the slightest fluctuation, like a corpse.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time,</p><p>A blush appeared on the white-clothed person's face, suddenly gaining some vitality, their eyelids fluttering, they woke up.</p><p>An almost imperceptible sigh echoed in the space.</p><p>The white-clothed person looked within themselves, the sight was unbearable, their expression bitter, "The Ice Ritual can indeed restore me, but it also overdraws my own foundation. It won't last long, I'll be even weaker later. Once the ice is released, that guy will come looking for me. Before that, I must deal with the most pressing danger…"</p><p>The fluorescence flickered.</p><p>The white-clothed person closed their eyes, their breath once again falling silent.</p><p>…</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The stone door suddenly shattered.</p><p>Only Bi Fang and the male and female demon kings remained outside.</p><p>They were startled, leaping to their feet and looking towards the rainbow rat as it burst from its cave.  Its eyes were bloodshot, its breath ragged, its head swaying in agitation.</p><p>"What happened?"  Bi Fang, though feeling a sense of foreboding, remained calm.</p><p>The rainbow rat gasped, "The mark is reacting! That person is breaking my tracking spell!"</p><p>Hearing this, the three demons' faces changed drastically.</p><p>The rainbow rat then coldly snorted, "Daring to tamper with the mark, they don't know what's good for them! I'll finish them off now!  I request the aid of you three friends!"</p><p>The three demons' fear turned to delight.</p><p>The rainbow rat opened its sharp mouth and let out a piercing shriek. The sound was incredibly shrill, like demonic music piercing the heavens, clearly audible even beyond the island. The demon soldiers nearby were thrown into chaos; some avian demons in mid-air froze, plummeting into the sea.</p><p>Ignoring the commotion outside, as the rainbow rat shrieked, it spat out a mouthful of refined blood, which suspended in mid-air. Bi Fang and the three demons exchanged glances, then simultaneously acted to help stabilize the blood.</p><p>The rainbow rat's eyes flashed.</p><p>Shortly after, the refined blood suddenly burst.  Fatigue flickered in the rainbow rat's eyes as it hissed, "Go!"</p><p>With that, the rainbow rat shrank to the size of a normal rat, leaping into the air.  Simultaneously, the male and female demon kings shimmered with light, transforming; the male into a hawk-like creature, the female into a green snake.  Together, they jumped onto the hawk's back. Bi Fang also assumed his demon form.</p><p>Two streaks of light, one black, one crimson, shot from the demon island, heading west.</p><p>They hadn't flown far when the sea churned; a green line parted the water, speeding towards them – the frog-fish carrying the cunning fox.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>On the unnamed island,  Island Master Shen was at his wit's end.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt a change in the bloodworm in his palm, his expression shifting. He quickly activated a spell and discovered the worm was taut, pointing directly west, easily pinpointing the location of the Xuan Tian Palace traitor.</p><p>Overjoyed and surprised, Island Master Shen rushed out of the hall, taking out a communication artifact to send messages. When it came to Abbot Mingyue, he hesitated.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation,</p><p>Island Master Shen decided to invite Abbot Mingyue to accompany him, just in case.</p><p>During this time, the demon tribe showed no signs of retreating, clearly unwilling to give up.  Although they had seemingly managed to ambush and kill the mastermind, the rainbow rat, Island Master Shen wasn't certain that Bi Fang didn't have other methods of locating the Xuan Tian Palace traitor.</p>
