<h1></h1><p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p><p>The Blood Infants were small in size, their fleeing light as thin as a strand of hair. Qin Sang would not allow them to escape so easily. Without hesitation, he formed a sword seal with his fingers.</p><p>The Ebony Sword flashed into existence above the Blood Infants, and a rain of sword light cascaded down. The sword array was on the verge of completion.</p><p>The Blood Infants' shrieks grew even more piercing. They tilted their heads back, their tiny eyes filled with an intense bloodlust, and a powerful aura erupted from their bodies.</p><p>The Blood Infants were connected not only to each other but also to the entire Soul Shadow Formation. Every Blood Infant was linked in some way.</p><p>At this moment, some of the Blood Infants had been sent out by the Elder Devil Ye and the Jade Bone Sect to control the blood clouds and the spectral ghosts, intercepting intruders and preventing them from approaching the blood altar, thus thwarting their grand scheme.</p><p>The other Blood Infants remained close to the altar, working to unseal it.</p><p>The resistance from the Blood Infants exceeded Qin Sang's expectations. Beams of blood light shot out from the tops of their heads, converging in the void.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Ebony Sword was struck. A crisp sound rang out as the sword was sent flying, its light shattered, and the sword array disintegrated.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's true killing move was not the sword array. The Ebony Sword was merely a feint.</p><p>While the Blood Infants were focused on the sword array, eighteen demon banners quietly emerged from Qin Sang's sleeves. The Nine Nether Demon Flames surged forth with unstoppable momentum, roaring like a fiery dragon as they lunged toward one of the Blood Infants!</p><p>Qin Sang knew it was impossible to capture all the Blood Infants, so he focused on just one.</p><p>The demon flames caused the Blood Infant to pale in fear, its shrill cries filled with terror. It tried to counterattack with blood light, but the hasty attempt was far weaker than before. The demon flames crushed the blood light effortlessly, leaving no trace.</p><p>The targeted Blood Infant let out a despairing scream as it was engulfed by the demon flames. The other Blood Infants scattered in all directions.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The demon flames did not pursue further. Instead, they coalesced into a single mass, floating quietly in mid-air. Inside, the flames churned violently as the Blood Infant struggled desperately, still connected to the Soul Infant Formation and drawing strength from it. It had not yet lost its fighting spirit.</p><p>However, within the demon flames, its efforts were futile. Qin Sang wanted to capture it alive and refrained from killing it outright. Otherwise, a single surge of the demon flames would have reduced it to ashes.</p><p>"Swish!"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Ebony Sword and inspected it. As expected of a flying sword forged from one of the Ten Divine Woods, there was not a single mark left on its surface.</p><p>He flew to the side of the demon flames and performed a series of hand seals, severing the Blood Infant's connection to the outside world and imprisoning it.</p><p>Soon after, Daoist Zhenyi and the others flew over as well. While Qin Sang had been attacking the Blood Infants, they had been freed from the pressure of the blood clouds and spectral ghosts, allowing them to witness the might of the demon flames.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Guan had heard rumors of Qin Sang's demon flames but was seeing them in action for the first time. He couldn't help but glance at them several times, his gaze also flickering toward the Nascent Soul puppet standing behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Recalling the various rumors about Qin Sang, the cultivator surnamed Guan sighed inwardly, "It won't be long before this man replaces Elder Devil Ye as the number one figure in the Northern Dipper Realm."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yuzhen!"</p><p>A tall, thin cultivator suddenly cried out and rushed toward the Blood Infant. Qin Sang was about to intervene but paused when he saw the man's grief-stricken expression. Remembering that this man was from the Sin Abyss, Qin Sang guessed the situation and chose not to stop him.</p><p>He glanced at the Blood Infant. Its features clearly resembled those of a female cultivator.</p><p>Yuzhen was not a newly ascended Nascent Soul cultivator, but like Old Man Feng, she had succumbed to temptation. Unlike Old Man Feng, however, she had not been so lucky. She had fallen victim to Elder Devil Ye, who had extracted her Nascent Soul, leaving her neither human nor ghost.</p><p>The tall, thin cultivator's fingers trembled as he reached out to touch the Blood Infant. Though it was restrained, the Blood Infant remained ferocious and snapped at him.</p><p>"Be careful, Fellow Daoist!" Qin Sang warned.</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi also flew over. After exchanging a glance with Qin Sang, he carefully examined the Blood Infant and sighed, shaking his head. "This is no longer Fellow Daoist Yuzhen. Elder Devil Ye's sinister techniques are too cruel. There's no way to save her. Please accept my condolences."</p><p>The tall, thin cultivator understood the implication. They had finally captured a Blood Infant, and it would undoubtedly be used to analyze the evil formation.</p><p>As a Nascent Soul cultivator, he did not interfere with Daoist Zhenyi and Qin Sang's actions. Instead, he retreated to the back, sitting cross-legged in the void, unable to bear looking any longer. He closed his eyes and silently recited the mantra for the dead.</p><p>The others also suppressed their joy and cooperated silently.</p><p>At that moment, the blood clouds and spectral ghosts surged back. The escaped Blood Infants, still restless, began to stir up trouble again. However, having learned their lesson, they hid themselves well this time, making it difficult even for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to track them.</p><p>...</p><p>"Wait! That's not the Sacred Flame!"</p><p>The Jade Bone stared intently in Qin Sang's direction, the joy in his voice fading slightly. "So it's the demon flames cultivated by the Nine Nether lineage through their comprehension of the Sacred Flame. I was wondering how the Sacred Flame could have ended up here!"</p><p>Elder Devil Ye's control over the Soul Infant Formation was not as strong as the Jade Bone's. After diverting some of his attention to sense the surroundings, he discovered Qin Sang's presence and realized that the "innate demon flames" the Jade Bone had mentioned were the flames controlled by Qin Sang's demon banners.</p><p>"So that's the origin. No wonder they're so powerful. I heard the demon banners were crafted by the old devil Kuiyin. I wonder where he got them from..."</p><p>As this thought crossed Elder Devil Ye's mind, the Jade Bone spoke again, "Although it's not the Sacred Flame, its power is still formidable. Excellent! Excellent! If I can seize these demon flames, I won't need to exhaust myself searching for other protective measures. I can focus on recovering my strength."</p><p>The Jade Bone laughed, rubbing his hands together eagerly, the soul fire in his eye sockets flickering rapidly.</p><p>Hearing this, Elder Devil Ye frowned deeply.</p><p>"You want to seize his demon banners? Do you know that my Blood Devil Avatar was destroyed by this man? He suddenly has a Nascent Soul puppet by his side, and who knows what other tricks he's hiding. Moreover, he's surrounded by Nascent Soul cultivatorsâ€”they're not to be trifled with. The altar is about to be unsealed, and you haven't fully recovered yet. I advise you not to stir up unnecessary trouble and jeopardize our plans..."</p><p>Before he could finish, the Jade Bone waved his hand dismissively.</p><p>"Who said I was going to seize his demon banners? I'm going to take the demon flames directly! Although I'm not a descendant of the Nine Nether lineage and can't directly claim them, a mere early-stage Nascent Soul cultivator like him could never truly subdue the Nine Nether Demon Flames. He's merely borrowing the power of the demon banners to control them indirectly. With a little effort, I can make them mine!"</p><p>The Jade Bone's tone was brimming with confidence, as if Qin Sang were beneath his notice.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the spectral ghosts, and after a moment of contemplation, he reached out with a large hand and grabbed.</p><p>Hundreds of spectral ghosts were pulled into his grasp.</p><p>The ghostly energy in his palm swirled, and the spectral ghosts floated within, being refined into soul energy that merged into the vortex.</p><p>The Jade Bone tossed the vortex upward, and it began to spin on its own, refining the spectral ghosts. In the blink of an eye, countless ghosts were devoured.</p><p>Gradually, a palm-sized funnel took shape in the void, smooth and pitch black as ink.</p><p></p>
