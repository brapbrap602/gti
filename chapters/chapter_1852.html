<h1>Chapter 1843: Inside and Outside the Healing Platform</h1><p>Outside the Healing Platform.</p><p>The atmosphere on the battlefield grew increasingly tense.  Even those with long lifespans, veterans of the previous Dao-Demon War, couldn't help but hold their breath, their hearts filled with trepidation.  Previous wars, while brutal, had escalated gradually from minor skirmishes.  Such a grand display of force from the very beginning was unprecedented.  It was difficult to imagine how cruel the coming battles would be.</p><p>Cultivators and demon cultivators alike kept their eyes fixed not only on the enemy before them but also on the mystical phenomena behind them.  Where these phenomena manifested was where the Demon Kings and Grand True Men resided, and everyone awaited their commands.</p><p>Battle could erupt at any moment.  Even if the struggle within the Healing Platform reached a conclusion, this tempest was far from over.</p><p>…</p><p>The two armies faced each other, weapons drawn and tensions high.  Qin Sang witnessed such a massive confrontation for the first time. Compared to the armies outside the Healing Platform, the Three Domains War in the North Star Realm seemed insignificant.</p><p>“The armies have arrived, yet there were no prior signs…”</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware of the intricate circumstances and hadn't anticipated the war's imminent arrival.  In his understanding, once behemoths like the Dao Court and the Ghostfang Kingdom engaged in war, thorough preparations would be made. He would surely have discovered some clues during his travels to and from Mount Juzhi.</p><p>The Serpent Demon held a significant position as a Demon God of the Ghostfang Kingdom.  With Mo Xingdao hiding within the demon kingdom, he should have sensed the impending conflict and sent a warning.</p><p>Yet, the armies of both sides stood facing each other outside the Healing Platform, sealing off its exit, as if out of thin air. The atmosphere was tense, but both sides seemed relatively restrained, unlikely to engage in immediate combat.</p><p>However, despite the open space between the armies, Qin Sang didn't dare venture out. The situation was extremely volatile, and it was difficult to predict the consequences of his appearance.</p><p>“The Dao Court and the Ghostfang Kingdom wouldn't wage war here without reason. If these armies, Demon Kings, and Grand True Men are merely here to receive someone or something, what is their true objective?”</p><p>Qin Sang retreated almost to the edge of the auspicious clouds, hoping their density would shield him from the Grand True Men's perception. He paused, turned, and gazed towards the depths of the Healing Platform.</p><p>This current upheaval was undoubtedly connected to the previous struggle within the Healing Platform. Unfortunately, he had chosen to remain neutral last time and remained ignorant of what they were fighting over.</p><p>Judging by the current situation, this matter would not end peacefully.  He feared the escalating conflict would lead to the armies storming the Healing Platform, bringing about the very scenario he dreaded most.</p><p>The only comfort was that the Soul Formation experts on both sides were still exercising restraint, remaining outside the Healing Platform.  For the time being, his own safety wasn't immediately threatened.  If chaos erupted, he could discreetly escape without much difficulty.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't want to abandon this cave dwelling, nor did he want the layout of the Healing Platform to be altered, rendering his previous efforts futile, forcing him to start anew.</p><p>Lost in thought, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly suddenly sent him a warning.  Qin Sang focused his attention and detected unusual fluctuations outside the auspicious clouds. Someone had entered the Healing Platform, emanating a powerful aura.  It seemed to originate from the Dao Court army's direction.</p><p>Both sides continued to dispatch experts into the Healing Platform, unconcerned about their enemies' presence.  This confirmed his suspicions.  The true battle was taking place within the Healing Platform!</p><p>After a brief moment of contemplation, Qin Sang decisively retreated from the auspicious clouds, traversing the golden hall area at maximum speed and vanishing into the Nine-Bend Star River.  He concealed himself in a hidden spot on the river's opposite bank.</p><p>At the Healing Platform exit.</p><p>The auspicious clouds churned as six figures emerged, all clad in Daoist robes. Some appeared youthful with crane-like white hair, resembling enlightened masters, while others looked as young as adolescents. However, their expressions and auras betrayed their extraordinary cultivation. The weakest among them was at the early stage of Hollow Profundity, a fourth-rank Immortal Official of the Dao Court.</p><p>Cultivators below Hollow Profundity would struggle to protect themselves in the depths of the Healing Platform and would only be a burden in this divine struggle.</p><p>If Qin Sang were present, he would have immediately recognized the leader as Grand True Man Wan from the North Pole Evil Warding Court.  Among the Daoists, led by Grand True Man Wan, was an elderly Daoist with a deeply wrinkled face.</p><p>The old Daoist held his right arm across his chest, grasping a horsetail whisk that hung from his elbow. His features seemed somewhat blurred, his eyelids slightly lowered, his expression unreadable.  His aura was faint, almost imperceptible, and he exuded a profound sense of age.  He quietly followed the other True Men, uttering not a word, easily overlooked.</p><p>Grand True Man Wan entered the golden hall, glanced around, conferred briefly with a fellow True Man beside him, and then issued a command.  The True Men immediately employed various movement techniques and Daoist arts. For a moment, all sorts of mystical lights intertwined. Some rode on jeweled chariots, others transformed into soaring dragons, while still others rode the wind, all displaying extraordinary abilities and lightning-fast speed.</p><p>Only the old Daoist walked through the void, his pace no slower than the other True Men.</p><p>They traversed the golden hall and arrived at the Nine-Bend Star River without hesitation, crossing it directly.</p><p>As they emerged from the Nine-Bend Star River, the True Men donned vigilant expressions and activated their protective techniques. Fortunately, there were no abnormalities outside the river.</p><p>Grand True Man Wan surveyed the area, retrieved a yellow talisman, and flicked it with his finger.  The talisman ignited spontaneously.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A pale yellow flame burned at Grand True Man Wan's fingertips, flickering gently.  He pointed it in several directions, observing the flame's changes. After a moment, he extinguished the flame and pointed towards the front right, saying, "Fellow Daoists, we'll enter from here!"</p><p>The other True Men offered no objections.</p><p>Just as they were about to depart, the old Daoist's figure paused almost imperceptibly. His pale eyes flickered with a faint light, then he resumed his indifferent demeanor and followed the other True Men.</p><p>None of the other True Men noticed, except for Grand True Man Wan, who vaguely sensed something and inquired discreetly, "Master Uncle, is there something amiss nearby?"</p><p>"Nothing. Perhaps I haven't been to the Healing Platform in a long time, and I'm overly sensitive."</p><p>The old Daoist responded indifferently, then fell silent.</p><p>Seeing this, Grand True Man Wan didn't probe further.  It was normal for demons to lurk here. Now wasn't the time for conflict.  He conferred with the other True Men and entered the depths of the Healing Platform.</p><p>After the True Men disappeared, Qin Sang slowly emerged from his hiding place, his gaze serious, watching the direction they had gone.</p><p>“Such acute perception!”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>He recognized his old acquaintance, Grand True Man Wan, but it was the old Daoist who truly captured his attention. Just now, as he observed from the shadows, a slight movement almost exposed him to the old Daoist's senses.</p><p>The old Daoist’s strength was formidable!</p><p>Grand True Man Wan was a fourth-rank Immortal Official, practically at the pinnacle of power below the Grand True Men.  However, in Qin Sang’s eyes, he was inferior to the old Daoist.</p><p>The old Daoist wore plain Daoist robes, giving no indication of his identity.</p><p>"Could he be a reclusive expert from the Healing Platform?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the two elderly Daoists who had interceded for him at the North Pole Evil Warding Court Healing Platform.  The Dao Court's Immortal Officials likely represented only their overt strength, concealing deeper, unknown reserves.</p><p>One of the auras among the demon cultivators earlier felt comparable to the old Daoist's. It might have belonged to a legendary expert who cultivated in seclusion within the Great Sage Mansion, having comprehended a Dharma Idol at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Even reclusive experts were mobilized, demonstrating the importance both the Dao Court and the Ghostfang Kingdom placed on this conflict.</p><p>These signs heightened Qin Sang's unease. He desperately wanted to understand the reasons, or at least ascertain their objectives.</p><p>Could hiding in his cave dwelling truly shield him from this tempest?</p><p>Qin Sang feared he might even lose his cave dwelling.</p><p>“I need to find someone to ask…”  Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>He didn't want to reveal himself and get caught in the crossfire. Ideally, he would make contact discreetly, which meant resorting to less than honorable methods.</p><p>Both sides traveled in groups to guard against their enemies, but Qin Sang didn't believe they would remain together indefinitely.</p><p>His natural target was the demon cultivators.  He held no prejudice against the demon cultivators of this world, but as a member of the human race, he couldn’t side with the demons unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>If one side had to be annihilated, he would choose the Ghostfang Kingdom.  Blood and race inherently determined one's stance, regardless of good or evil.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the spot where Grand True Man Wan had stood, recalling his actions with the talisman.  He surmised that the yellow talisman was a Dao Court identification tool. When Grand True Man Wan pointed it in certain directions, the flame visibly expanded. He ultimately chose a direction where the flame showed no reaction.</p><p>“Those directions likely hold other Dao Court experts…”</p><p>Qin Sang cross-referenced this with the locations of the damaged seals, identifying two directions that likely held only demon cultivators.  He randomly chose one and set off immediately.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Healing Platform, all sorts of wondrous illusions dazzled the eye.  Currently, esteemed individuals, rarely seen by ordinary people, traveled in groups, traversing the illusory landscape.</p><p>From the outside, the Mount Juzhi Healing Platform didn't appear particularly vast.  However, upon entering, one realized the true extent of its inner space.</p><p>Even with so many Nascent Soul experts mobilized by the two factions, exploring the entire Healing Platform was a pipe dream.  Furthermore, some areas within the depths of the Healing Platform were simply inaccessible to Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The aimless search continued.  Both sides seemed to be deliberately avoiding each other, unwilling to engage in unnecessary conflict before finding their objective.</p><p>Therefore, a long period passed without any fighting within the Healing Platform. Everyone focused on navigating the dangers within the illusions.</p><p>Somewhere within the Healing Platform.</p><p>This particular illusion presented a vast space, a world of crystal. Here, one could only see multicolored crystals.  The entire illusion was essentially a single, colossal crystal, its interior riddled with winding passages like mine shafts.</p><p>Fortunately, all the passages were spacious, avoiding any sense of confinement.</p><p>However, within this space, both vision and divine sense were restricted.  The shimmering crystals obstructed sight, and, most alarmingly, they absorbed divine sense.  Any divine sense that touched the crystals was instantly devoured.  Even without actively extending one's divine sense, remaining in this space for a certain period would lead to its gradual depletion.</p><p>Furthermore, the crystals were incredibly hard, making forced passage impractical. To explore the entire crystal illusion, one had to personally traverse every corner.</p><p>Currently, within one of the crystal passages, six figures gathered. Though all humanoid, most bore features that indicated their incomplete transformation, unique markers of their demon cultivator identities. Some retained these features due to their unique bloodlines, while others chose to keep them.</p><p>The six demon cultivators had already ascertained the crystals' properties and were discussing their strategy. The crystal space was vast, and without thorough exploration, it was easy to overlook something. Their mission was of paramount importance, and they couldn't afford any oversights.</p><p>"In this marquis' opinion, apart from these crystals, there's nothing else of note here.  Traversing the entire space would be a waste of time. Let's split up!  We're all within the same illusion, so it will be easy to provide support if anything happens. What are Marquis Xuan's thoughts?"  A thin man with a serpentine tail instead of legs spoke in a deep voice.</p><p>The other demon cultivators seemed agreeable and turned to another heroic-looking man, Marquis Xuan.</p><p>Marquis Xuan pondered, glancing at a stocky man with round eyes and an elephant-like trunk, clad in black robes, beside him.  Seeing the stocky man nod slightly, Marquis Xuan wasted no time and immediately issued the order to split up.</p><p>"Explore quickly and reconvene here!"</p><p>The other demons acknowledged the order, accustomed to Marquis Xuan's behavior.  Throughout their journey, whenever they faced significant decisions, Marquis Xuan would first consult the stocky man.  They were unaware of the stocky man's true identity but speculated he might be a powerful expert from the Great Sage Mansion; otherwise, Marquis Xuan wouldn't be so deferential.</p><p>The six demon cultivators, including the stocky man, dispersed with a rumble, each choosing a passage and employing movement techniques to traverse it swiftly, striving to explore every corner as quickly as possible.</p><p>Among the six demon cultivators was a female, devoid of any delicate or charming features.  Her physique was like an iron tower, exceptionally robust.  This was because she was originally a Dragon-Scaled Horse Beast from the Luo River in the Ghostfang Kingdom.  Even after transformation, she retained a wide mouth, a striking characteristic.</p><p>‘Splash… splash…’</p><p>The sound of water echoed through the passage.  Despite her robust build, the female demon moved with surprising agility, gliding through the passage on ripples of water, leaving no trace.</p><p>Each of the six demon cultivators was responsible for a specific direction. The female demon focused on her assigned area, weaving through the intersecting passages.  She held a token crafted from black jade, radiating a deep luster.</p><p>The female demon’s fingers occasionally flickered with a faint light as she rubbed the black token, seemingly using it to search for something.</p><p>As they had previously discovered, the crystal space only absorbed divine sense and posed no other dangers. Their exploration speed allowed them to leave before their divine sense was completely depleted.</p><p>With Marquis Xuan and the mysterious expert nearby, there shouldn't be any issues.  Although the female demon thought this, she didn't relax her vigilance, meticulously searching every corner.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the female demon traversed several passages. The passage ahead appeared identical to the others.  She glanced at it and then rode the water ripples into it.</p><p>Ahead, water splashed as something moved even faster than her through the passage, reaching the other end without incident.</p><p>The female demon’s expression remained unchanged as she rode the water forward.</p><p>Just as she reached the latter part of the passage, about to emerge, a sense of unease inexplicably arose in her heart.</p><p>Everything within the passage appeared normal.  She couldn't pinpoint the source, but with her intuition, she wouldn't feel uneasy without reason.</p><p>The female demon's pupils suddenly contracted.  Her expression remained unchanged, but the ripples beneath her feet abruptly turned silvery-white.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The water surged, about to form a silver tidal wave, rushing forward.</p><p>The female demon halted abruptly and retreated, her wide mouth opening to unleash a roar imbued with divine power.  An oval-shaped silver stone became visible in her throat.  This action, even if it couldn't repel the hidden enemy, could shake the crystals and alert her companions.</p><p>Her reaction was swift, but it was still a step too late.</p><p>Just as the water surged and her divine power was about to be unleashed, brilliant sword light erupted within the passage.  Reflected by the crystals, the sword light was blinding, making it impossible to discern whether it was a single strike or multiple.</p><p>A terrifying killing intent descended along with the sword light, causing even the resolute female demon’s heart to tremble in fear.</p><p>At the passage exit.</p><p>Qin Sang, his body covered in poisonous hairs, stepped inside.  Few could match his familiarity with the Healing Platform. He had long known the peculiar nature of this crystal space and chosen this direction, successfully finding his target.</p><p>Although the crystals could absorb divine sense, as long as he didn’t actively extend it, they posed no threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The surging water was trampled underfoot, instantly scattering into fragments.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
