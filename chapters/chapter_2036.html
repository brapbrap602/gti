<h1>Chapter 2027: A World in a Ring</h1><p>Pei Gongfeng ultimately decided to accompany Xin Shaozhu on the Jade Spirit hunt, but he left behind a Nascent Soul realm spirit beast and a Xin Clan cultivator, ostensibly to protect Qin Sang.</p><p>The spirit beast, named Huali Bao, wasn't a divine beast or an exotic species. Logically, it should have been able to shapeshift long ago.  It was unknown whether it had undergone some transformation or simply disdained taking human form, but it still appeared as a beast—a flower leopard several times larger than normal.</p><p>Qin Sang knew Pei Gongfeng's intentions in leaving Huali Bao behind. He was curious where Pei Gongfeng's confidence came from, thinking that a Nascent Soul realm spirit beast could monitor him.</p><p>After Pei Gongfeng and the others left, Qin Sang immediately ordered Huali Bao and the Xin Clan cultivator to guard the two ends of the canyon.</p><p>Huali Bao leaped to the canyon entrance, pacing back and forth like a wild beast patrolling its territory.  Its peripheral vision occasionally glanced towards the canyon, observing Qin Sang stroll to the spring, circle the grove, and carefully examine the spirit trees.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly flicked his sleeve, sending out several streaks of light that transformed into spirit banners.  These banners planted themselves around the grove, forming a flag formation. Mist filled the formation, obscuring its interior more and more.</p><p>Huali Bao's eyes widened.  It hurried to the edge of the grove and said in a deep voice, "Elder Qin, why are you setting up a formation?"</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze, his eyes sharp and merciless. He barked, "This old man was invited by the Xin Clan.  Do I need to report to you, a beast, about what I intend to do?"</p><p>A flicker of anger flashed in Huali Bao's eyes, but it dared not show it. It hastily lowered its head and said, "This one dares not. This one is tasked with protecting Elder Qin, worried that danger might befall you and I wouldn't be able to react in time."</p><p>"What danger could there be while this old man refines tools within the valley?"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, a cold glint flashing within. "This old man is going to utilize a secret technique to refine these spirit woods. I cannot be disturbed during the refinement process.  Could it be that you wish to steal this old man's secret technique?"</p><p>Huali Bao's fur stood on end at these words.  Utterly terrified, it repeatedly denied such intentions and hurriedly retreated to the canyon entrance.  Watching the canyon now sealed by mist, it let out a helpless sigh.</p><p>Within the mist, Qin Sang stared at the spirit trees, lost in thought.</p><p>The spirit trees were indeed withering, but the situation wasn't as dire as Qin Sang had claimed.  He had deliberately exaggerated to create an opportunity to be alone. He hadn't expected to so easily divert Xin Shaozhu and Pei Gongfeng.</p><p>Qin Sang could easily deceive the two Nascent Soul cultivators outside and slip away unnoticed. Xin Shaozhu certainly wouldn't imagine that he had received other guidance here and could traverse the formation without the ferry.</p><p>"Should I go now?"</p><p>Qin Sang focused his senses on the Qianjun Ring. The sensation grew clearer, and the location resonating with the ring seemed not too far away.</p><p>He mentally calculated the time, estimating whether he could return to the canyon and refine the ferry before Xin Shaozhu and the others came back.</p><p>The reason he didn't plan to simply leave was twofold.  First, he had made a promise to the Xin Clan.  Second, he was unsure what lay ahead. The Qianjun Ring might only be connected to a part of the secrets here. Xin Shaozhu definitely possessed information he didn't, and he might need the Xin Clan's help later.</p><p>There's a chance!</p><p>After careful calculation, Qin Sang believed it was feasible. He at least had enough time to take a look and then adapt to the circumstances.</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang employed a Chongxuan Sect secret technique on the spirit trees to slow their withering.  Then, he concealed his form and silently swept towards the mist, passing by the Xin Clan cultivator, who remained completely oblivious.</p><p>Leaving the canyon, Qin Sang raised the Qianjun Ring and examined it closely.  A dark light flickered on the surface of the ring.  The Qianjun Ring had been with him for over a thousand years, and he had never witnessed such a phenomenon before.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring now looked incredibly strange, like an antique unearthed after centuries of burial, finally seeing the light of day again, about to reveal its inherent brilliance.</p><p>"Just how many treasures does the Ziwei Palace hold..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, lamenting once more that he had to abandon the Ziwei Palace for the Earth-Slaying Sword.</p><p>The unsealed Qianjun Ring guided Qin Sang with vibrations, leading him along a very tortuous and winding path between the island mountains.  As he was flying, Qin Sang suddenly paused, sensing a familiar aura.</p><p>Another Jade Spirit!</p><p>Since he had encountered it, he might as well collect it.  Qin Sang steered his flying sword, slashing towards the void. With a single strike, he forced the Jade Spirit out.</p><p>Sword energy crisscrossed, leaving the Jade Spirit with no escape. It finally dissipated, leaving behind a jade shard slightly larger than the previous one.</p><p>Qin Sang held the shard, examining it as he continued on his way.</p><p>Perhaps because the ferry wasn't complete or he didn't have enough jade shards, he didn't discover any guidance and put it away.</p><p>As he drew closer to his destination, he was still within the formation, but the surrounding scenery had subtly changed.</p><p>The island mountains became sparse, and the surroundings gradually emptied. Darkness enveloped the area, and Qin Sang felt like he was heading towards an 'abyss' in the void. In a trance, it seemed as if even the concepts of up, down, left, and right ceased to exist.</p><p>Passing another island mountain, he faced empty void ahead.  After flying for a short distance, another shadow appeared in front of him.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. The shadow wasn't an island, but resembled a crack in the void, lying horizontally above the sea. This sight was somewhat familiar, reminding him of the Small World fragments within the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>Approaching the 'crack,' the Qianjun Ring pulsed violently.  Qin Sang was certain: whatever resonated with the ring was here!</p><p>Gray mist filled the crack.  Qin Sang activated his spirit vision, gazing intently. His sight seemed to penetrate a void fissure, vaguely discerning the scene within.</p><p>It was an island, a piece of land floating in mid-air.</p><p>Unlike the outside world, the island was lush with greenery, vibrant flowers, and murmuring springs. Apart from the absence of birds, beasts, and fish, it was a scene of thriving life and flourishing nature.</p><p>The island was roughly several dozen miles in diameter, with a few rolling hills, not particularly steep, but possessing a graceful, spiritual beauty.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly.  He saw some man-made structures on the highest mountain.  A high altar stood at the summit, flanked by several pavilions and halls, all with closed doors.</p><p>The altar's design didn't appear to be of human origin, nor did it entirely resemble the witch tribe altars outside. It was ancient and mystical.</p><p>There were no people in the mountains, nor any signs of life on the entire island, as if it had been dormant for countless years.</p><p>"Could the thing attracting the Qianjun Ring be in the altar or one of the halls?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, confirming there was no danger. He tentatively entered the gray mist, passed through the crack, and lightly landed on the island.</p><p>The Gray Warbler Sword hovered above Qin Sang's head, its blade shimmering. If any danger approached, he was ready to unleash a strike.</p><p>The surroundings were incredibly quiet. Qin Sang took a deep breath. If this was also a fragment of a Small World, the spiritual energy of that Small World must have been extremely abundant.</p><p>Glancing around, just as Qin Sang was about to walk towards the highest mountain peak, the Qianjun Ring suddenly vibrated and slipped from his hand.</p><p>What happened next completely defied Qin Sang's expectations.  Even someone with his resolute will felt an immense shock, disbelief filling his widened eyes!</p><p>The Qianjun Ring slowly ascended, transforming into a ball of dark light, rising higher than the highest mountain peak.  As the dark light hung in the air, Qin Sang suddenly felt the soul imprint he had left in the Qianjun Ring violently fluctuate, as if it were being torn apart.</p><p>Immediately afterward, an image projected from the dark light.</p><p>The image displayed a small space filled with various items, precisely the belongings Qin Sang had stored within the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>The most abundant items were spirit stones.</p><p>A pile of high-grade spirit stones lay casually in a corner like ordinary rocks. As for mid-grade and low-grade spirit stones, Qin Sang had long since cleared them out, disdaining the space they occupied.</p><p>Heavenly materials and earthly treasures, jade slips and ancient texts, treasure boxes and pill bottles, magical treasures and spiritual treasures…</p><p>Items that would make any Nascent Soul cultivator's breath hitch were neatly arranged and categorized.</p><p>The void seemed like a mirror, reflecting these treasures.</p><p>No!</p><p>It wasn't just a reflection!</p><p>That space seemed to be materializing from within the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression drastically changed. Without time to think, he flicked his fingers repeatedly, hurriedly retrieving the items.</p><p>The transformation happened incredibly fast. Just as Qin Sang collected his belongings, the space truly manifested. Simultaneously, Qin Sang felt the ground beneath his feet, even the entire void, tremble.</p><p>As the space materialized and dark light diffused, the Qianjun Ring itself became increasingly illusory, flickering in and out of existence.</p><p>An invisible wave emanated, spreading through the void. The void responded with an identical wave, as if the two shared the same origin, as if they were originally one, now finally reunited.</p><p>Vaguely, Qin Sang seemed to understand something, yet he wasn't certain. If his conjecture was true, it was too shocking, beyond his comprehension.</p><p>Uncertainty filled Qin Sang's heart. Feeling the surrounding fluctuations intensify, as if the void was about to tear apart, he worried about danger.  He took one last look at the Qianjun Ring and retreated along the same path.</p><p>Exiting the crack, standing outside, Qin Sang's eyes remained fixed on the interior. He saw the dark light continuously spreading, obscuring the mountains, the altar, and the halls, eventually sealing even the crack itself.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring was no longer visible.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang hesitated whether to employ some technique, he suddenly felt an incredibly violent tremor. His heart skipped a beat, and then his vision was filled with dark light.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Dark light erupted from the crack, incredibly dense.</p><p>But through the dark light, Qin Sang vaguely saw an unusual sight. It was a distorted image, still the land and void he had seen before, but now the land and void seemed to melt like water.</p><p>Supreme goodness is like water, adapting to any shape, never destroyed no matter how twisted or deformed.</p><p>Perhaps the land and void weren't distorted; it was all an illusion. Due to some unknown transformation, it appeared this way to Qin Sang.  As for anything else, it was beyond his understanding, his vision limited, so he 'couldn't see.'</p><p>He saw the dark light, like water, gushing outwards, expanding to its limit in an instant. Then, as if encountering some powerful restraining force, the dark light abruptly receded.  Between the ebb and flow of the dark light, the void and land within expanded and contracted accordingly.</p><p>The changes were too rapid, too drastic. Even with Qin Sang's eyesight, he couldn't clearly discern all the details.</p><p>'Buzz…'</p><p>The Qianjun Ring reappeared, the band trembling. The dark light finally contracted to its extreme, transforming into a thin stream that flowed into the ring.</p><p>The next moment, the crack, the land, and the Qianjun Ring's own space all vanished before Qin Sang's eyes. The sky above the sea was empty, leaving only a black iron ring.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring's appearance hadn't changed, only gaining a different air of mystique. It trembled a few times, quieted down, and then, its light fading, it fell towards the sea.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly caught it, extending a strand of divine sense, tentatively enveloping the Qianjun Ring. He discovered that the soul imprint he had left on it was almost completely erased. Fortunately, the imprint remained, easily restored.</p><p>Then, his divine sense probed into the Qianjun Ring, 'seeing' a space countless times larger than before.</p><p>Land, mountains, halls, a high altar, vegetation, flowing springs…</p><p>It was the land and void within the crack, unexpectedly 'absorbed' into the Qianjun Ring.  The Qianjun Ring's original space was nowhere to be found, having merged with this vast void.</p><p>At this moment, the interior of the Qianjun Ring resembled a real world.</p><p>No, it was a real world!</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang materialized within the space. Surrounded by spiritual energy, the fragrance of vegetation filled his nose, not a bit illusory!</p><p>A Small World, a Small World, or perhaps a fragment of a Small World, refined into a Mustard Seed-type artifact. Or perhaps the Dao Mark of a Small World refined into an artifact, carried close by!</p><p>For some unknown reason, this Small World later fragmented and now had been reunited.</p><p>Containing a world within a ring!</p><p>Even if it were just a fragment of a Small World, it was a profound divine ability beyond Qin Sang's comprehension.</p><p>Qin Sang had thought that the Dao Court, relying on the Divine Court to sever the Great World and form its own realm, was shocking enough. Now it seemed that Great Ascension cultivators could treat Small Worlds as playthings, manipulating them at will?</p><p>What kind of divine ability was this!</p><p>Body Integration?</p><p>Great Ascension?</p><p>Body Integration cultivators controlled Domains, but a Domain and a World were likely concepts on different levels.  The gap between him and the peak cultivators was far greater than he had imagined, powerful to the point of incomprehensibility, even though he had touched upon the fringes of Sword Domain!</p><p>The Qianjun Ring contained a Small World, hence possessing a power other Mustard Seed artifacts lacked, able to hold the bone flute.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring was the Dao Mark gate of this Small World. Carrying the ring was equivalent to carrying the Dao Mark gate, allowing entry and exit at any time. Now, he was the master of the Qianjun Ring, thus the master of this Small World.</p><p>Although Qin Sang didn't yet understand what this meant for him, it was undoubtedly a great opportunity!</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, calming his mind.  Just as he was about to carefully explore this world, he suddenly felt his entire body tighten, the void vibrating abnormally.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>Heaven and earth overturned, signs of destruction!</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, hurriedly retreating, his face tense.  Seeing that the Qianjun Ring gradually stabilized after he left, he finally let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>"It should be because it was fragmented for too long, just recently reunited, the space is unstable. Even if I'm the master of the Qianjun Ring, I can't enter and exit freely, others certainly can't.  I don't know the Qianjun Ring's limits, whether it's related to my cultivation level. It seems utilizing this world won't be easy…"</p><p>Qin Sang's attention was completely captivated by the Qianjun Ring.  As he pondered, his expression shifted slightly, belatedly realizing the tremors hadn't stopped and had transmitted to the outside world.</p>
