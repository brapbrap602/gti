<h1>Chapter 1118: Three Years</h1><p>The two sat and discussed the Dao, gaining new insights into their cultivation. To avoid disturbing Yunyouzi during his tribulation, Qin Sang stayed for a few days before bidding farewell and returning to Peach Blossom Valley. Thus, three years passed.</p><p>During these three years, Yunyouzi focused primarily on seclusion, and Qin Sang rarely disturbed him. Qin Sang inquired about the situation in the Demon Realm, and as expected, Yunyouzi was quite knowledgeable about it. He also knew a little about the demon king who had stolen the mysterious stone slab, sharing a few rumors. However, Qin Sang had no intention of seeking trouble with the demon king now. Stealing a treasure from a demon king was too far-fetched, and unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang would never entertain such a thought. Especially now, as Yunyouzi was at a critical juncture in his tribulation.</p><p>On this day, Qin Sang was deep in meditation, absorbing the power of the celestial stars. Not long ago, he had finally reached the peak of the third layer of the *Heavenly Demon Refinement*, only to encounter another bottleneck. This barrier was even more challenging than before. He attempted to use the Star Platform to infuse himself with star energy, but the star energy was too weak and insufficient to help him break through again. Currently, the most suitable place for star energy infusion in the cultivation world was the Peak of Heaven. To reach the Peak of Heaven, Qin Sang needed the help of Qing Jun, but she had not returned for many years, and Qin Sang could not find her. Thus, he had no choice but to wait patiently.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang devoted himself entirely to cultivating the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, making rapid progress.</p><p>A streak of light flew into Peach Blossom Valley. Qin Sang was startled from his meditation, catching the light and momentarily stunned.</p><p>"The tribulation is approaching so soon?" The light seemed to be a message from Yunyouzi, stating that he had made all necessary preparations and that the tribulation would occur in one month. He requested Qin Sang to protect him during the process. The timing was earlier than previously mentioned.</p><p>Qin Sang had not expected it to happen so quickly. He rose to his feet and hurried out of his cave, pausing to glance at Bai's cave. He had always wanted to introduce Yunyouzi to Bai, but since Bai had entered seclusion last time, he had not emerged, fully focused on comprehending the Soul Pearl. Qin Sang did not know how far Bai had progressed and dared not disturb him. After a moment of hesitation, Qin Sang activated the cave's restrictions and sent a message inside.</p><p>Although Qin Sang believed Yunyouzi was fully prepared and that his protection would likely be uneventful, he thought it prudent to have Bai's assistance, just in case.</p><p>A moment later, Bai's voice came from the cave, tinged with fatigue. "Someone is undergoing the Nascent Soul Tribulation? It would be good to observe."</p><p>The cave opened, and Bai emerged. After such a long period of seclusion, Bai's aura seemed unchanged from twenty years ago.</p><p>"Congratulations on your significant progress in cultivation!" Bai's sharp eyes immediately noticed Qin Sang's improvement and remarked, "Back then, we were evenly matched. Now, even without using that thunder technique, you can easily surpass me."</p><p>Qin Sang, though praised, did not become complacent. He shook his head and said, "Without reaching the Nascent Soul stage, we are all but ants." Even if he became the top Golden Core cultivator, what did it matter? Qin Sang's goal had always been to become a Nascent Soul Ancestor.</p><p>Bai nodded and said no more. After learning about Yunyouzi's background from Qin Sang, Bai retreated into his Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>Half an hour later, Qin Sang arrived at the agreed-upon location with Yunyouzi. The place was on a desolate island at the edge of the Yun Cang Great Marsh. From a distance, Qin Sang saw Yunyouzi and Li Yufu standing atop a mountain peak. He accelerated, his figure flickering with light as he landed before them.</p><p>"Uncle Master!" Li Yufu greeted him.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Li Yufu's expression was unusually grave, his eyes filled with worry, undoubtedly concerned for his grandmaster. The Nascent Soul Tribulation was the first major trial on the path of cultivation, where success was built upon countless failures.</p><p>Yunyouzi, however, appeared carefree, his robes fluttering in the wind, showing no signs of tension.</p><p>"Brother, these are some recently refined spirit pills to aid in the tribulation. I collected extra medicinal herbs and managed to refine two batches. Here's one for you," Yunyouzi said, tossing three jade bottles to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang caught them and found that the bottles contained spirit pills of various colors, some for restoring true essence, others for healing soul and body injuriesâ€”all tailored for the tribulation. Though they were not as miraculous as the Soul Cleansing Liquid, which could increase the chances of forming a Nascent Soul, they would still provide significant assistance during the tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang had planned to purchase such pills from a merchant guild but was pleasantly surprised that Yunyouzi had prepared them. Knowing Yunyouzi's skill, these were undoubtedly top-grade spirit pills.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior!" Qin Sang accepted them without hesitation.</p><p>From Qin Sang's understanding of Yunyouzi, he knew the man was not as relaxed as he appeared. Who would dare underestimate the tribulation? Yunyouzi's demeanor had subtly changed over the past three years. His seclusion had not only been for refining pills but also for reflecting on his life's experiences, making his Dao heart more transparent. To Qin Sang, Yunyouzi now seemed slightly more detached.</p><p>"The location for the tribulation is in the western part of the Yun Cang Great Marsh, a very remote area..." Yunyouzi explained as they flew deeper into the marsh. "The Sin Abyss has occupied most of the Tian Xing Alliance's territory, forcing some of its sects to relocate north. The Xiao Han Domain has ceded the Yun Cang Great Marsh to them, making it much livelier than before. Otherwise, we wouldn't need to choose such a remote spot..."</p><p>The Nascent Soul Tribulation also involved spiritual energy infusion. While it did not require an extremely rich spiritual vein, not just any location would suffice. Yunyouzi had carefully selected an island in the Yun Cang Great Marsh, where several hidden spiritual veins converected. He had long since set up a grand formation on the island in preparation for the tribulation.</p><p>Staying within the Taiyi Pill Sect, under the protection of the sect's grand formation and with the sect master guarding him, would have been the safest option. Yet Yunyouzi chose to take the risk and undergo the tribulation outside.</p><p>"I've already checked. The area around the island is barren, with no traces of Nascent Soul cultivators or shape-shifting demons. If any deep-sea demons are disturbed by the tribulation and emerge, it will be up to you to handle them..." Yunyouzi said.</p><p>The three of them flew non-stop into the depths of the Yun Cang Great Marsh. The marsh was vast, but most of it was barren, especially in the western region, which held little value. Along the way, they encountered many cultivators, mostly from the Tian Xing Alliance. As they traveled further west, the number of cultivators gradually dwindled. By the final stretch of their journey, they saw no one.</p><p>"We're here!" Yunyouzi stopped over a vast expanse of water. With a wave of his sleeve, the water parted to reveal the outline of a spiritual formation. Within the formation was a small island, no more than ten miles in diameter. At its center stood a solitary peak, towering and pointing toward the heavens.</p><p>This was the location Yunyouzi had chosen for his tribulation!</p><p>With a calm expression, Yunyouzi nodded to Qin Sang and Li Yufu before disappearing into the formation. The Nascent Soul Tribulation could only be faced alone. Outsiders could not assist, nor could they get too close, lest they provoke a mutation in the tribulation and perish together.</p><p>Li Yufu's face was filled with worry. Watching as Yunyouzi sat atop the mountain peak and the formation gradually closed, Qin Sang exhaled softly and said, "Let's go too."</p><p>They flew to a nearby desolate island to await the arrival of the tribulation!</p>
