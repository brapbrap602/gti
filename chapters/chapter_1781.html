<h1>Chapter 1772:  Tao Hengshan</h1><p>Qin Sang was cultivating in a secluded cave.  He had survived the tribulation and would have three hundred years of peaceful cultivation ahead, allowing him to focus on his plans.</p><p>He circulated his cultivation techniques, healing the injuries from the tribulation.  Thanks to his strong recovery ability, these wounds healed quickly.  However, Qin Sang gradually noticed something unusual.  His physical body had inexplicably become much stronger!</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned. After his breakthrough, he had focused on comprehending two divine abilities, neglecting his cultivation.  This improvement was unexpected.</p><p>“Could it be…?”</p><p>A flash of insight struck him.  Qin Sang remembered that during the tribulation, when the grey tribulation lightning struck him, a strange energy seemed to have seeped into his body.  At the time, he had been focused on surviving the tribulation and hadn’t noticed the anomaly.</p><p>Could this grey tribulation lightning be responsible for his transformation? For cultivators, each tribulation was a difficult test, but also an opportunity. However, this was the first time Qin Sang had gained such significant benefits from a tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly discovered that it wasn't just his physical strength that had improved. His spiritual body and Nascent Soul also seemed to have changed. It was a complete transformation.  To put it simply, he was closer to the Dao. Previous misunderstandings and deficiencies in his understanding of the Dao had been corrected, the benefits of which were self-evident.</p><p>“Cultivators ascending from the Lesser Thousand World all go through this?  Though dangerous, if you survive, it's like receiving the acknowledgment and gift of this world's Dao. I wonder if future tribulations will also change…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>This further solidified his belief that he had entered the Greater Thousand World, possibly settling in a secluded corner of it.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly remembered the Sky Eye Butterfly.  Could the Sky Eye Butterfly, having absorbed much tribulation lightning, also have gained an opportunity?</p><p>Qin Sang focused on his dantian, saw the Sky Eye Butterfly resting quietly on his Nascent Soul's shoulder, and carefully called out to it. The butterfly’s reaction was somewhat sluggish.</p><p>“Digesting the tribulation lightning…”, Qin Sang thought.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly was at the peak of its fourth transformation, on the verge of a breakthrough.  If it could receive the benefits of the tribulation, it should greatly aid its advancement.</p><p>Of course, he still needed to refine the Green Frost Pill, and he was currently gathering information about the Hundred-Knot Bamboo.</p><p>…</p><p>Tao Hengshan, Crane Cry Mountain.</p><p>After returning to his cave and resting briefly, Qin Sang set off again, heading for Star Island Lake.  This trip was planned before his tribulation.  First, he had a prior agreement with the Swordmaster, and second, Star Island Lake, as a gathering place for cultivators in Tao Hengshan, would be easier to obtain the information he sought.  He planned to travel around Star Island Lake while visiting the Swordmaster, so he didn't alert Gu Zhou Zhenren and set off alone.</p><p>A portion of the western region of Tao Hengshan was completely controlled by the Dao Court.  Xuan Dao City was the easternmost city in this region, its name reflecting the Dao Court's high hopes for it.</p><p>Traveling west from Crane Cry Mountain to Xuan Dao City, one could use a teleportation array to return to Bai Shi. Qin Sang had visited this city when he last visited Master Lingxu.</p><p>However, this time, Qin Sang did not go west. After leaving Crane Cry Mountain, he traveled northwest, arriving at a city called Li City after half a month.</p><p>Although Li City had an ambiguous relationship with the Dao Court, it wasn't under its control.  It was jointly built by various forces in Tao Hengshan. Its scale couldn't compare to Xuan Dao City, and it was even smaller than Crane Cry Mountain. Nevertheless, this small city was well-known in Tao Hengshan.</p><p>From Li City, traveling through several cities, each equipped with teleportation arrays, one could reach Star Island Lake. This was one of the safest and most convenient routes in Tao Hengshan.</p><p>Looking at the north-south direction, Tao Hengshan's terrain resembled a funnel.  It gradually widened toward the north and narrowed toward the south.  This explains why the Dao Court and Gui Fang Kingdom chose Huangquan Dao as their battlefield.</p><p>When Qin Sang infiltrated Gui Fang Kingdom, including the time spent searching for the Four Seasons Dream Flower, he only spent less than a year.  The distance in the north-south direction was far greater, and since Star Island Lake was located in the northern part of Tao Hengshan, flying was too slow.</p><p>Li City was built on a plain, with a wide view.  Although not large, it was heavily guarded.  The city gate was bustling with people.  Many Tao Hengshan cultivators bypassed Li City, first traveling west to Xuan Dao City, then to Crane Cry Mountain – a safer route.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the city with the flow of people.  Nearly 90% of the cultivators he saw wore Daoist robes.  Under those robes, they may not have practiced Daoist teachings, but they certainly were influenced by Daoist principles.</p><p>Li City was just a stopover, offering nothing of interest, so Qin Sang went straight to the teleportation array.</p><p>Yunfeng City.</p><p>This was a city between Li City and Star Island Lake.  Exiting the teleportation array in Yunfeng City, Qin Sang didn't continue north. Leaving the city, he recalled the geographical map in his memory and flew east.</p><p>Several days later, Qin Sang saw several north-south mountain ranges in the distance, with vast river plains formed by the rivers outside the mountains.  The area was densely populated.</p><p>Several places in the mountains showed signs of cultivator gatherings.  He didn't stop, continuing east, where he saw rolling hills and many similar locations nestled among the mountains. These were the locations of nearby sects' mountain gates.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang stopped before a spiritually vibrant mountain range.</p><p>"Tao Heng Mountain."</p><p>The name flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  Years ago, returning from Star Valley to He Ming Mountain while gathering information on Ju Shan Zhi, he had first befriended the Tao Heng Mountain sect leader.</p><p>At that time, the Tao Heng Mountain sect leader's cultivation was at the mid-Yuan Ying stage, equivalent to the mid-Sheng Xuan Dharma position in this realm, nearing the late Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>With many Nascent Divinity experts in this realm, a sect leader only at the mid-Yuan Ying stage seemed somewhat weak. Qin Sang suspected Tao Heng Mountain must have hidden experts.</p><p>As Qin Sang traveled, he discovered many large and small sects clustered around Tao Heng Mountain, like stars surrounding the moon.  This was because Tao Heng Mountain possessed a Dharma Altar, with the authority to confer initiation rites!</p><p>This altar, known as the Tao Heng Sect Altar, was certainly not built by Tao Heng Mountain.  Even Tao Heng Mountain might not know which Daoist sect originally owned it.</p><p>In Ju Shan Zhi, not every sect had a Dharma Altar.  Those seeking initiation rites had to rely on sects possessing one.  This was why these sects gathered around Tao Heng Mountain, acting as, to some degree, vassals to Tao Heng Mountain.</p><p>Therefore, the structure of Ju Shan Zhi differed greatly from the Storm World.  In the Storm World, sects built around spirit veins; here, sects prioritized access to Dharma Altars.</p><p>Without affiliation with a sect possessing a Dharma Altar, they could only use spirit stones and treasures to purchase initiation rites for their disciples; otherwise, they faced the crisis of their lineage being cut off.</p><p>One can imagine the immense value of a Dharma Altar, making it a coveted prize that only the powerful could protect.</p><p>"Who dares approach?"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't concealed his presence.  Mountain guards spotted him immediately and questioned him.</p><p>"I am Qing Feng, here to visit Tao Zhenren. This is my visiting card," Qin Sang introduced himself.</p><p>Learning that the visitor was there to see their sect leader, the guards didn't dare to be negligent and quickly reported.  Soon, laughter echoed from the mountain, and a Daoist in green robes flew down – Tao Zhenren himself.  "A distinguished guest!  My apologies for the delayed welcome!"</p><p>The two embraced, engaging in cordial conversation before entering the mountain.</p><p>After some pleasantries, Tao Zhenren asked, "Fellow Daoist, what brings you out on this journey?  Is there anything I can assist with?"</p><p>"I came to visit you specifically, Fellow Daoist," Qin Sang said with a smile.</p><p>Tao Zhenren feigned displeasure.  "I know your character, Fellow Daoist.  Thirty years ago, I invited you, yet you made me wait this long. Your dedication to the Dao surpasses mine.  Unless you have important business, you won't be leaving my cave dwelling!"</p><p>"It wasn't a matter of unwillingness, but rather unavoidable circumstances."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly.  Back then, he'd been pressed by a Heavenly Tribulation and couldn't afford any distractions.</p><p>Tao Zhenren didn't probe further.  "Fellow Daoist, are you planning on traveling and selecting initiation rites for your disciples on this trip?"</p><p>"Precisely, so I've come directly to your treasured location," Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>When Qin Sang had befriended Tao Zhenren years ago, he had pretended to be seeking disciples and appropriate initiation rites for them.</p><p>Tao Zhenren understood. "I haven't forgotten our agreement from those years; it still stands. As long as you choose the Tao Heng Sect Altar and become a Tao Heng Mountain guest elder, your descendants can all receive initiation rites at the Tao Heng Sect Altar."</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "Back then, I hadn't made a decision and hadn't thoroughly inquired about your sect's initiation rites…"</p><p>"These are not secrets."</p><p>Tao Zhenren pondered for a moment.  "Fellow Daoist, come with me to the Initiation Hall, and you'll see."</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. "Wouldn't that be too presumptuous?"</p><p>As its name suggests, the Initiation Hall was the place for the sect's initiation rites. The sect's core Dharma Altar was located there, making it undoubtedly a restricted area.</p><p>Tao Zhenren had already risen and walked towards the door, saying it was alright.</p><p>Tao Zhenren was unaware of Qin Sang's true cultivation.</p><p>If Qin Sang deliberately concealed his strength, even cultivators of the same level would struggle to see through it, let alone him.</p><p>However, Tao Zhenren was confident in the Initiation Hall's defenses.</p><p>The Initiation Hall was the most heavily guarded place in the sect; even a Dong Xuan expert wouldn't gain an advantage trying to infiltrate, and he wasn’t taking Qin Sang to the Tao Heng Sect Altar itself.</p><p>Qin Sang understood this reasoning and wouldn't be foolish enough to cause a disturbance in a sect's restricted area.</p><p>The Initiation Hall was located in a valley deep within Tao Heng Mountain; from above, one could see several scattered halls within the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard that Daoist Initiation Halls were numerous and used to enshrine deities, grand and solemn, unlike the simpler Tao Heng Mountain.</p><p>However, Tao Heng Mountain wasn't a mainstream Daoist sect, so it didn't follow those conventions.</p><p>Tao Zhenren and Qin Sang landed outside the valley and entered a large hall where some books were kept.</p><p>"The Tao Heng Sect Altar can bestow the first level of the Tai Shang Zheng Yi Tong Zi Ling Guan Jiang Jun initiation rites, involving the contemplation of sixty Jia Zi Tai Sui Gods – the water-affiliated deities close to the main protective deity of the altar.  It’s not difficult to invite them to serve as the altar’s guardian deities."</p><p>Tao Zhenren explained, "The ritual of receiving the Inspecting Water Jade Talisman involves meditating on the Water Department Heavenly Gods.  Experience shows that invoking the Jin Guan Bi Su emissaries as guardian deities is the easiest..."</p><p>If Qin Sang had just entered this realm, she would have completely failed to understand the meaning of Tao Zhenren's words.</p><p>Daoist sects have different practices; each sect's tradition encompasses several practices, ranked in order of importance, forming a complete system.  Each system usually has a specific name, such as the Tianshu Academy's cultivation method or the Beiji Exorcism Academy's Northern Emperor method.</p><p>The Tao Heng Sect's method is known by nearby cultivators as the Tao Heng Mountain Method.  As Tao Zhenren said, the Tao Heng Mountain Method only has two levels, because each level corresponds to two major cultivation realms.</p><p>Initiation involves receiving the Talisman of the Supreme Zhengyi Boy Divine General, corresponding to the Zhengyi and Morality levels. Further initiation is unnecessary; cultivation can proceed normally, equivalent to the Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment stages.</p><p>After receiving the Inspecting Water Jade Talisman at the sect altar, cultivation can continue to the Cave God and Ascending Profound levels—the peak of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>If someone in Tao Heng Mountain were to break through further, the Tao Heng sect altar cannot provide further instruction; they would have to seek it elsewhere.</p><p>The Sixty Jiazi Tai Sui God and the Jin Guan Bi Su emissaries are legendary Daoist deities.  Invoking Heavenly Gods in the practice refers to them; successfully meditating on a Heavenly God allows one to invite it as a guardian deity.</p><p>Previous sects, when establishing their altars and passing down their practices, may not have corresponded to these particular deities. This might be due to differing methods, incomplete traditions, or other reasons, making it impossible for Tao Heng Mountain cultivators to meditate on them.</p><p>However, it doesn't matter; as long as one can meditate on similar deities and successfully invite them as guardian deities, cultivation can proceed.</p><p>The Tao Heng Mountain Method having only two levels confirms the previous Swordmaster's statement.  It's difficult to seek higher-level practices!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's thoughts, Tao Zhenren continued his explanation, "After your disciples receive the Talisman, if they establish a Golden Seal Altar, the most suitable material is Silver Dew Tree sap. Our sect cultivates many Silver Dew Trees; we can provide you with a certain amount, ensuring your disciples won't need to worry until they reach the Cave God level."</p><p>He considered his offer sincere, but attracting a top-tier expert isn't easy.  Tao Zhenren looked at Qin Sang, awaiting a response.</p><p>"Silver Dew Tree sap..." Qin Sang muttered to herself, recalling Tao Zhenren's earlier explanation.</p><p>From the names of the practices and the deities meditated upon, she saw that the Tao Heng Mountain Method leans toward the Water element.</p><p>In fact, each practice has different focuses, with distinctions in the five elements, Yin and Yang, etc., used for classification.  Although these practices can all establish altars and invoke deities, cultivators should ideally choose a practice closer to their own cultivation method, supposedly providing certain benefits.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's understanding of the "Chapter on Cultivating the Nascent Soul Sword," this method is formless; at least, the five-element methods should all be suitable.  Of course, Qin Sang doesn't expect to gain many benefits.</p><p>If sword methods and killing methods existed, they would be the most suitable for her.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang first considered the practice that would allow the fastest altar construction.  Cultivators outside the Daoist tradition mostly cultivate Golden Seal Altars; even within Daoist sects, only a few can support Daoist soldiers.</p><p>The materials needed for a Golden Seal Altar must have properties that match the practice, called "harmonization." Otherwise, even if it's forcibly constructed, the altar will be unstable.  Essentially, building an altar involves refining the special power of these materials, merging it with the power of the practice.</p><p>Considering her own situation, Qin Sang had already considered that the most suitable practices for her were Fire Department and Thunder Department methods!  Not the Water Department method like the Tao Heng Mountain Method.</p><p>She has the Vermilion Bird True Feather and the Sky Phoenix True Feather.  If she could use the true fire contained within the feathers to build an altar, wouldn't it be easy to create a sturdy altar?</p><p>As for the Thunder Department, she had hunted a Thunder Turtle beast in the Storm World, obtaining the beast's bones and core.  The bones and core contain the Thunder Turtle's innate thunder power, which should allow the creation of a Nascent Soul level altar if refined.  She also possesses higher-level materials; the Qingluan primordial thunder power within her Phoenix wings is in no way inferior to the two true fires!</p><p>A new error correction function has been added.
