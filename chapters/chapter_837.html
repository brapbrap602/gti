<h1>Chapter 829: Eighteen Devil Banners</h1><p>Initially on Zhitian Peak, Qin Sang was caught in the conflict between Granny Jing and the Yuan Shen Sect, and after killing a young cultivator from the Yuan Shen Sect, he obtained a copy of "Records of the Grand Mysterious Array," which contained several exquisite and spiritual formations.</p><p>Qin Sang intended to adapt these formations.  The Ten Directions Yama Banners comprised more than ten banners, possessing the power of top-grade magic treasures, requiring utmost caution and preventing any waste of such precious artifacts.</p><p>After verifying the formations, he took out several mid-grade spirit stones, imbuing them one by one into the array, finally adding the high-grade spirit stone.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The spirit stones entered the array.  The five elemental forces in the air surged, and Qin Sang deployed a restrictive formation around the perimeter to prevent excessive commotion and alarming other cultivators on the mountain.</p><p>Then, he appeared in the air, sitting cross-legged, attempting to control the array.  Under his control, the five elemental forces continuously converged towards the center of the array, forming a grey, chaotic light.  Simultaneously, the spirit stones in the array shone brightly, rapidly depleting.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of heartache, but without hesitation, he beckoned, and the Xuan Tie Pillar flew into his palm before being placed into the array.</p><p>The Xuan Tie Pillar, upon entering the chaotic light, began to rotate rapidly.  Qin Sang changed his hand seals repeatedly, and the array's power continuously converged towards the center, impacting the Xuan Tie Pillar.</p><p>Initially, no changes were visible. Qin Sang remained unhurried, patiently observing, until he finally saw a subtle change.  A faint black light flickered on the surface of the Xuan Tie Pillar.  Qin Sang understood—this black light was the manifestation of the restrictions within the Xuan Tie Pillar, resisting the array's erosion.</p><p>The restrictions within the Xuan Tie Pillar were extremely profound and powerful.  Even the faint black light emitted exerted immense pressure on Qin Sang.  He dared not "provoke" the restrictions, proceeding very slowly.</p><p>Despite their power, the Xuan Tie Pillar was incomplete, broken into two sections.  The fracture provided an opening, offering him an opportunity.  The array's power, along with the Xuan Tie Pillar, impacted the point of fracture, integrating into it.</p><p>As time passed, the black light on the surface of the Xuan Tie Pillar grew increasingly intense.  Upon closer inspection, it was not black light but the Xuan Tie Pillar itself "melting"!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave. This step was extremely difficult. His movements were extremely gentle, fearing that a slight mistake could cause the internal restrictions of the Xuan Tie Pillar to go berserk.  Not only would the array be destroyed, but he would also risk severe injury.</p><p>During the refining process, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel admiration and awe.</p><p>Firstly, for the ancient cultivator who forged the Xuan Tie Pillar. The internal restrictions were extremely profound, opening Qin Sang's eyes.  Although he only grasped a fraction of it with the help of the array, mastering even this fraction would significantly improve his refining skills.</p><p>Kui Yin Old Ancestor had also attempted to comprehend the Xuan Tie Pillar's restrictions, but ultimately gave up. He had declared that this object was undoubtedly crafted by a top-tier ancient cultivator, extremely exquisite, an ancient treasure, and even in its damaged state, a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator would be unable to comprehend it.  Kui Yin Old Ancestor deeply envied the brilliance of the ancient cultivation world, regretting not having lived in that era.</p><p>Secondly, for Kui Yin Old Ancestor's extraordinary talent, to have conceived of such a method for utilizing this ancient treasure.  Unable to break the Xuan Tie Pillar's restrictions, he instead used the fracture, employing skillful force to divide and refine the Xuan Tie Pillar into banner poles, thereby controlling the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>The "melted" Xuan Tie Pillar resembled a black liquid column, with slight undulations on its surface. Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, his consciousness locked onto the Xuan Tie Pillar, rapidly memorizing the internal restrictions—all beneficial to his refining, for future comprehension.</p><p>Meanwhile, he continuously changed his hand seals, operating secret techniques, to divide the Xuan Tie Pillar.  Several attempts failed; the Xuan Tie Pillar only rippled slightly, failing to divide into banner poles.</p><p>Exhausted, Qin Sang paused to regain his energy.</p><p>"As expected, my current cultivation is insufficient. I've wasted many spirit stones. If Kui Yin Old Ancestor had done this personally, three high-grade spirit stones would have sufficed. However, it wasn't entirely wasted; the experience from these failures will make the next attempt smoother…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he sat in meditation.  Soon, he recovered and continued refining.</p><p>With each attempt, Qin Sang's movements became more proficient, the fluctuations on the Xuan Tie Pillar intensifying, but the high-grade spirit stone's luster noticeably dimmed.</p><p>"Condense!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly let out a low roar. The Xuan Tie Pillar trembled violently. Under Qin Sang's tense gaze, a small section of the Xuan Tie Pillar separated, vibrating incessantly, attempting to return.  Qin Sang watched intently, his hand seals changing rapidly.</p><p>Finally, the section of black iron pillar stabilized, reshaped into a banner pole by the spirit array.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang felt a surge of joy, but the process wasn't complete yet.  He didn't dare to be careless, forcefully throwing a jade bottle containing several beast spirits.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The beast spirits broke free from the bottle, roaring angrily and lashing out at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was prepared.  With a flick of his finger, countless strands of true energy bound them, and he then used a secret technique to refine them. The beast spirits struggled in vain, being refined into a crystal that was embedded into the banner pole.</p><p>A flash of light, and the banner pole was complete!</p><p>Qin Sang held it in his palm, examining it lovingly. This was his first refined magic treasure, a crucial step on his path to becoming a master refiner.</p><p>“This means the black iron pillar is enough to create fifteen banner poles, and the Netherfire is more than sufficient.  Combined with the three I already have, I'll have eighteen magic banners!”</p><p>Qin Sang silently calculated, his surprise immense.</p><p>Ten magic banners would barely reach the level of a top-grade treasure.  Eighteen? What kind of power would that be? Could it reach the pinnacle of magical treasures?</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang understood that his cultivation level limited his true energy and spiritual sense, making it impossible to simultaneously control so many banners. He would only know how many he could wield once he had them.</p><p>“I must thoroughly study the *Tai Xuan Array Fragments*!”</p><p>Overwhelmed with excitement, Qin Sang made a firm decision.</p><p>While the spirit stone hadn't been depleted, he continued refining, completing another banner pole before the high-grade spirit stone ran out of energy and shattered.</p><p>The first high-grade spirit stone yielded only two banner poles, but Qin Sang was confident that three more would suffice.</p><p>He waved his hand, putting away the black iron pillar and spirit array, then began to study the formations he had previously observed.</p><p>Days turned into weeks.</p><p>Qin Sang diligently cultivated, rarely leaving his cave dwelling.</p><p>Over half a year had passed since he returned to the island, when Madam Liu finally appeared.</p><p>That night.</p><p>Qin Sang was refining his body using starlight, when a feeling arose. He took a jade pendant from his bosom.  A faint white light emanated from it – the restriction he had left in his mortal dwelling had been triggered.</p><p>“It took them this long. I wonder what good news they bring...”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He stopped his cultivation, put on his cloak, and went out.</p>
