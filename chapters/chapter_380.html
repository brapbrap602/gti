<h1>Chapter 373: The Hive</h1><p>Outside the hive, venomous bees swarmed erratically.</p><p>The Binding Cord, well-concealed, approached the hive from below, undetected by the bees.</p><p>Ghost Head Bees, named for their bee-like appearance and swarming behavior, build nests resembling those of bees. However, they are not true bees, but rather a peculiar type of insect.</p><p>Unlike bees, they have no queen and exist in pairs.</p><p>If these venomous bees retained the characteristics of Ghost Head Bees, Qin Sang would only need to capture a few pairs.</p><p>The Binding Cord lurked in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>One bee circled the hive, its range gradually widening until it finally separated from the swarm.</p><p>The Binding Cord sprang forth like a viper.</p><p>The bee, exceptionally alert, sensed the Cord just as it was about to be ensnared. Its stinger aimed at the Cord, and its six blood-red wings vibrated intensely, emitting an incredibly sharp sound.</p><p>If this sound reached the other bees, they would be alerted, and escape would be the only option.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was prepared. At the instant the bee reacted, the Binding Cord accelerated dramatically, seizing the bee and silently retreating.</p><p>The Cord, with the bee secured, landed in Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>The bee struggled violently, but the Cord, capable of binding even Foundation Establishment cultivators, easily held the insect fast.</p><p>Avoiding the stinger, Qin Sang carefully examined the bee. Comparing several key features, it did indeed closely resemble a Ghost Head Bee.</p><p>He tentatively named it the Bloodwing Ghost Head Bee.</p><p>The others curiously approached. The old man softly asked, "Daoist Qing Feng, may I examine this venomous bee?"</p><p>Qin Sang knew the old man wanted to study the Bloodwing Ghost Head Bee's characteristics to find a way to harvest the Bloodpoison Flowers.</p><p>Capturing this bee was relatively easy because this hive was on the outermost edge, the smallest in size, and the swarm sparse.</p><p>Around the Bloodpoison Flowers, several enormous hives clustered together, teeming with bees.  The sight was enough to make one's scalp tingle. Capturing them one by one would be impossible.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Qin Sang handed the Bloodwing Ghost Head Bee to the old man, a 'poof' sound erupted.</p><p>A spurt of foul blood flew out.</p><p>Everyone was startled and quickly dodged.  The Bloodwing Ghost Head Bee had self-destructed.</p><p>The jade slip mentioned that Ghost Head Bees were ferocious and difficult to tame. It seemed these mutated Bloodwing Ghost Head Bees were even more so, choosing self-destruction over capture.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. He repeated the process, capturing several more bees, only to witness the same result.</p><p>Finally, after capturing all the Bloodwing Ghost Head Bees around the small hive, Qin Sang carefully removed the hive itself.  His divine sense swept through it, revealing a cache of Bloodwing Ghost Head Bee eggs.</p><p>Could these larvae be tamed?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, placing the hive in his storage pouch.  He decided to table the matter for now.</p><p>Firstly, the others wouldn't wait indefinitely. Secondly, the other hives were too close together; it was impossible to collect them without alerting the bees.</p><p>The answer would come when the larvae hatched.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to the others, signaling they could proceed.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang about to leave, the old man's expression grew anxious.  "Daoist, wait!"</p><p>"What is it, fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned ignorance.</p><p>"Please, Daoist, a word in private!"</p><p>The old man pulled Qin Sang aside and bowed deeply.  "Daoist, you seem to have extensive knowledge of these venomous bees. Please, would you be so kind as to share your insights?"</p><p>Qin Sang appeared to contemplate, neither agreeing nor refusing.</p><p>Seeing this, the old man understood. He retrieved his share of the Coldgold Ore from his storage pouch. "I have little of value, but this Coldgold Ore is somewhat presentable. Please accept it, Daoist."</p><p>The old man was willing to part with it. The Bloodpoison Flowers must be crucial to him and his apprentice.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke frankly, "To be honest, fellow Daoist, I do know a bit about a type of venomous bee called the Ghost Head Bee. I suspect these Bloodwing Ghost Head Bees are a mutated variant.  However, whether they retain the Ghost Head Bee's characteristics after mutating under the influence of the blood miasma, I'm uncertain."</p><p>Disappointment flickered across the old man's face, but he didn't retract the Coldgold Ore.</p><p>He had tried asking others, but no one was willing to risk provoking the bees for a piece of Coldgold Ore.</p><p>Left with no other choice, the old man had settled for this.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, took the Coldgold Ore, and copied the information about Ghost Head Bees from his jade slip onto another, which he handed to the old man.</p><p>The old man and his apprentice stayed behind, leaving a group of five.</p><p>All five were experts. Traveling at full speed, they were faster than before.</p><p>Soon, they reached the foot of the mountain.  Continuing onward, their figures gradually disappeared into the depths of the blood miasma.</p><p>Not long after Qin Sang and the others left, a figure followed.</p><p>This person paused, looking at the mountain and then at the direction Qin Sang and his group had taken. While hesitating, their gaze suddenly sharpened, as if they had discovered something.  They then propelled themselves forward without hesitation.</p><p>…</p><p>No further incidents occurred along the way.</p><p>Kong Xin diligently led the way, successfully guiding them out of the blood miasma.</p><p>Within Boundless Valley, except for certain areas, there was no blood miasma, and there was no need to continue using the Azure Yang Demonic Fire for protection.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade pendant and observed the surroundings.</p><p>Inside and outside the blood miasma were clearly two different worlds, though both within Boundless Valley.</p><p>At first glance, the area appeared normal, with mountains, water, flowers, and grass, seemingly no different from outside Boundless Valley.</p><p>However, the ever-present crimson clouds hanging in the air, and the strange roars echoing in the distance, served as a constant reminder: This was Boundless Valley!</p><p>These clouds were likely formed from the mixture of the ancient restrictions and the ferocious blood煞 energy.  There might even be spatial rifts hidden within them. In any case, it was best to avoid flying at high altitudes.</p><p>Kong Xin kept his words brief, outlining the necessary precautions before taking the lead.</p><p>The first half of Boundless Valley wasn't particularly dangerous. Even Qi Refining cultivators could enter this area to search for treasures.  The deeper one went, the more perilous it became.</p><p>As they journeyed, detours were common. Sometimes they had to绕道 several times to find a safe route, avoiding demon hordes or unknown restrictions.</p><p>This was due to Qin Sang and the others' insistence.</p><p>After the earth cave incident, it was difficult for them to fully trust Kong Xin. Every so often, they demanded a detailed explanation of the route, which they would then analyze and vote on.</p><p>This irritated Kong Xin, but he had no choice.</p><p>Their journey continued without major incident, and they finally reached their destination.</p><p>Crossing a ridge, a stream like a jade ribbon flowed from a ravine.</p><p>Kong Xin's spirits lifted. He called out, "We're here!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed, observing the surroundings while discreetly glancing behind him, secretly surprised.</p><p>Throughout the journey, he and Yun Youzi had been vigilant, deliberately exposing themselves a few times.</p><p>However, the follower never reappeared, seemingly vanished.</p>
