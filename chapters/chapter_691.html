<h1>Chapter 683: The Blue Jiao's Inner Core</h1><p>“So fast!”</p><p>The old man exclaimed, his face filled with shock.</p><p>From the moment they saw Qin Sang make his move to when he charged into the Jiao group, it had only been a few dozen breaths.  Qin Sang had already effortlessly captured the leader of the Blue Jiaos, with no sign of a fierce battle.</p><p>This meant the Blue Jiao was suppressed without any resistance.</p><p>The three exchanged glances, all deeply shocked, with a thick worry coloring their eyes.</p><p>They had accepted Qin Sang's commission after careful consideration, believing that with their several trump cards, they would have the power to resist even if Qin Sang turned against them.</p><p>Now they realized how naive they were.</p><p>This Daoist in the cloak possessed extraordinary strength. If he really wanted to attack them, they would be just like that Blue Jiao, completely helpless.</p><p>“Kill the Jiao!”</p><p>The old man, a decisive person, turned his gaze away from Qin Sang and gritted his teeth.</p><p>The other two also knew that it was too late to think about this now. Qin Sang's actions along the way didn't seem overly cruel, which gave them some comfort.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't care what the others were thinking.</p><p>He first cleaved the demonic mist with his sword, then released two Flying Night Fiends.  Cooperating with his Ebony Sword, capturing and killing a mere peak Spirit Severing Stage Blue Jiao was naturally effortless.</p><p>However, he didn't dare to be careless.  After capturing the Blue Jiao leader, he immediately summoned the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, preparing to slay the Jiao and extract its soul. Otherwise, if he delayed too long, the surrounding demonic beasts would be attracted.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and pressed it against the Blue Jiao's forehead.</p><p>The Blue Jiao roared furiously, its ferocious nature flaring. But as the talisman grew brighter, the light pierced into the Blue Jiao's body like silver needles, and its struggles began to weaken.</p><p>Soon, a palm-sized Jiao dragon soul was slowly extracted from its forehead, inch by inch, floating towards the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman.</p><p>The Jiao dragon soul began to resist violently, but everything was futile in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly formed hand seals, urging the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman to devour the Jiao dragon soul bit by bit, until the talisman completely stabilized.</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned with his hand, and the talisman flew into his palm.</p><p>Within the pure, jade-like talisman, seven Jiao souls were already imprisoned, its power having increased another level.</p><p>Putting away the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, Qin Sang turned to look around.</p><p>Having lost their leader, the remaining Jiao dragons were in chaos, scrambling to escape towards the seabed.  The old man and the other two had taken advantage of the chaos to kill a dozen large Jiaos, their expressions filled with excitement.</p><p>By now, the seawater below had been dyed red with blood, and a faint bloody smell drifted outwards.</p><p>The water mist was also thinning.</p><p>Just then, the old woman's voice suddenly came from outside: “Daoist, the eastern waters seem to be stirring. There's a strange wind whipping up waves, blowing towards us."</p><p>Qin Sang shouted: “Stop killing! Divide the Jiao corpses and leave this place!”</p><p>If they attracted a powerful demon, all six of them would be in grave danger.</p><p>Moreover, according to the rules of Duyan Island, they couldn't completely exterminate this group of Blue Jiaos. They had already taken enough.</p><p>The old man and the others also knew the severity of the situation and immediately stopped, collecting their spoils.</p><p>Qin Sang also skillfully butchered the Jiao corpse in front of him, taking only the valuable parts and storing them in his Qianjun Ring. Finally, as he cut off the Jiao's head, Qin Sang let out a soft exclamation.  Probing with his True Essence, he extracted a blue pill resembling a demon core.</p><p>“Is this a Demonic Beast Inner Core?”</p><p>Seeing the pill, Qin Sang recalled the Skyfire Jiao Inner Core he obtained from Kong Xin in Wuya Valley.</p><p>The two looked very similar.</p><p>However, the Skyfire Jiao Inner Core contained powerful fire energy, while this inner core seemed to be a poison pill, slowly corroding his True Essence.</p><p>After entering the Demonic Sea, Qin Sang's understanding of Demonic Beasts had greatly improved. He knew that this kind of inner core wasn't unique to Skyfire Jiaos. Hunting late Spirit Severing Stage Demonic Beasts also had a chance of yielding similar inner cores, though the probability was very low.</p><p>Demonic beasts with inner cores were generally stronger than others. Whether these inner cores were related to demon cores, cultivators hadn't figured out yet. However, like demon cores, inner cores could also be added to Fiend Demon Pills and Blood Bone Pills to enhance their potency, making them highly valuable.</p><p>This Blue Jiao, possessing an inner core, should have been very powerful. Unfortunately, it was unable to display its full strength before being surrounded and killed by Qin Sang and his two Flying Night Fiends.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade box, about to seal the inner core, when he suddenly felt a stirring from the Fat Silkworm in his insect basket.  Intrigued, he paused. The Fat Silkworm's cries were as urgent as when it had encountered the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, filled with impatience.</p><p>Could it be that its true favorite food was Demonic Beast Inner Cores?</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy. He had tried countless methods, but the Fat Silkworm had remained indifferent. He hadn't expected to find something it liked here by chance!</p><p>"No, it might also be because this is a poison pill that it attracts the Fat Silkworm's interest. I wonder if a true demon core would work?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Fat Silkworm's poison-related abilities and muttered to himself.</p><p>Now wasn't the time to confirm this. Qin Sang first stored the Blue Jiao Inner Core, quickly finished dissecting the Jiao corpse, and seeing that the others were also done, immediately ordered their departure.</p><p>The six of them concealed their presence and fled outwards, hearing the roaring waves behind them.</p><p>They didn't dare to look back until they had escaped a considerable distance.</p><p>They saw that the area where they had hunted the Jiao was now ravaged by strong winds, demonic energy soaring to the sky, even obscuring the moon.  From the depths of the sea, terrifying dark shadows seemed to emerge.</p><p>If they had been even a little later, they would have been trapped inside!</p><p>Everyone was secretly alarmed and became even more cautious, traveling through the night and escaping the area without further incident.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>"You've been active here for so long, you should have a safe base, right? Take me there. We'll come out to hunt Jiao again after this area calms down."</p><p>Qin Sang said in a deep voice.</p><p>After killing the Blue Jiao last night, Qin Sang felt the subsequent commotion was a bit too much and decided to play it safe.</p><p>The old man hesitated for a moment, but ultimately obeyed Qin Sang's order, turning south and flying.</p><p>After several days of continuous flight, they landed on a desolate island.</p><p>Crevices in the island led down to the earth, where, at the very bottom, a spiritual vein was hidden.  Though not large, it was suitable for use as a cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang gave a few instructions and chose the innermost cave, setting up restrictive formations.</p><p>He took out both the Fat Silkworm and the Blue Jiao Inner Core.</p><p>Upon seeing the Blue Jiao Inner Core, the Fat Silkworm's eyes lit up just as they had when it saw the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, its cries filled with intense longing.</p><p>Although the inner core was valuable, if it could enhance the Fat Silkworm's abilities, Qin Sang wouldn't be stingy.  He immediately unsealed the Blue Jiao Inner Core and tossed it to the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm cried out happily, a seven-colored halo appearing on its body as it landed on the Blue Jiao Inner Core.  Then, its entire body crawled over, embracing the inner core.</p><p>It didn't gnaw on the inner core like it had the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, but instead absorbed the power of the Blue Jiao Inner Core through the seven-colored halo.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm held the inner core with a satisfied expression, not forming a cocoon, seemingly asleep yet not asleep. The Blue Jiao Inner Core didn't seem to change.</p><p>It appeared that absorbing the Blue Jiao Inner Core would be a long process.</p>
