<h1>Chapter 1242: The Final Encounter</h1><p>Chapter 1242: The Final Encounter</p><p>The Buddhist presence in Beichen was weak, consisting only of a few insignificant sects, mostly located in the desert.</p><p>However, numerous ancient Buddhist sites were unearthed in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, including the Thousand-Body Shadow Talisman from the Shangyuan Quiet Palace and the *Stone Bridge Zen* scroll that Dongyang Bo had previously obtained.</p><p>With the Thousand-Body Shadow Talisman broken, Gong Liangyu realized that this old fox had already thoroughly understood his cards, anticipating his every move.</p><p>Being outmaneuvered to such an extent by a Nascent Soul master filled Gong Liangyu with a bizarre sense of honor.</p><p>The Thousand-Body Shadow Talisman was his strongest escape method.</p><p>With the talisman useless, Gong Liangyu knew his demise was inevitable.</p><p>As expected, despite his unwillingness to die, he tried other methods, but before he could even initiate them, Dongyang Bo had already prepared countermeasures.</p><p>In fact, he couldn't even begin his attack.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A defensive treasure was easily knocked away by Dongyang Bo. Gong Liangyu, now completely out of options, was filled with despair, watching helplessly as the Vajra Pestle descended upon him.</p><p>Gong Liangyu felt a binding force tightly constricting him. His bones cracked, inflicting excruciating pain as his body and golden core were firmly trapped, making self-destruction impossible.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Vajra Pestle blazed with intense white light, generating boundless flames that enveloped Gong Liangyu.  His protective spiritual energy was instantly shattered, and before he could even scream, he was reduced to ashes.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, having plotted for years with murderous intent, acted decisively.  His attack was swift and merciless, leaving Gong Liangyu no chance to breathe.</p><p>He had already obtained the method to control the Nascent Soul puppet, so keeping Gong Liangyu alive was unnecessary.</p><p>Furthermore, when he had taken the Boiling Blood Evil Flower, he sensed the area was treacherous and dangerous, and it was best to avoid causing a disturbance.</p><p>Gong Liangyu's death in the blood lake would leave no trace for anyone to investigate.</p><p>By seizing the Nascent Soul puppet, Shangyuan Quiet Palace would become even more reliant on Shaohua Mountain – a win-win situation.</p><p>Though it seemed complex, from Dongyang Bo's appearance to the capture of the puppet and the killing of Gong Liangyu, it all happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>With Gong Liangyu dead, the Nascent Soul puppet, lacking a master, instinctively sensed freedom and frantically attacked the formation and the jade bottle.</p><p>However, its attacks lacked coherence, appearing fierce but largely ineffective.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was about to extinguish the flames, use the Vajra Pestle to restrain the Nascent Soul puppet, and take it away, when a sudden warning flashed in his mind.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A sword light pierced through the blood mist, swift as lightning, pulverizing the blood shadows along its path.  The force was astonishing, aimed directly at Dongyang Bo's back.</p><p>Feeling a sharp sting from the incoming sword, Dongyang Bo's expression changed drastically.  There was a third person here!</p><p>Furthermore, the sword's aura was extraordinary; this person was also a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>He had no time to think, leaping forward to hastily recall the Vajra Pestle.  A crisp sound echoed as the Vajra Pestle violently trembled, shooting out an image of itself with comparable power, intercepting the flying sword in a flash.</p><p>Zuoyan had once used the Interminable Blood Mulberry to set a trap.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had also suffered losses from the Blood Pollution Divine Light. He learned from his past mistakes, and now, whenever he used his life treasure, he always held back, avoiding the unrestrained, all-out attacks of the past.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>A sound of clashing metal resonated.</p><p>The Vajra Pestle image blocked the flying sword, its light retracting inward, attempting to use the same technique to bind the flying sword and seize it.</p><p>At the beginning of the great battle, he had used the Vajra Pestle to snatch several treasures from Zuoyan cultivators, always with success.</p><p>However, this time, he miscalculated.  The image only managed to trap a section of the sword tip before it could no longer restrain it. The image buzzed, developing cracks and showing signs of shattering.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was secretly shocked.  The Vajra Pestle had been meticulously refined by him for years, and even the life treasure of the Mysterious Void Demon Lord might not be much stronger. The opponent's flying sword seemed to surpass the Vajra Pestle, a top-tier, exquisite treasure.</p><p>'Whoosh…whoosh...'</p><p>The blood mist howled as a figure rapidly followed the sword light.  Cold light flashed from the eyes behind the mask, coldly gazing at the slightly disheveled Dongyang Bo. It was Qin Sang.</p><p>His face was ashen.</p><p>Worried about being discovered by Dongyang Bo, he had deliberately kept his distance.</p><p>He had assumed that Gong Liangyu, as the leader of his sect, would certainly have sufficient escape methods, and with the Nascent Soul puppet by his side, he should at least be able to withstand a few attacks from Dongyang Bo, giving him enough time to arrive.</p><p>Who could have imagined that Gong Liangyu would be no match for Dongyang Bo, becoming a victim in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang also did not expect that Dongyang Bo's true objective wasn't the treasure in the blood river, but Gong Liangyu and the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>A mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator plotting against a mere Foundation Establishment junior—Qin Sang didn't even have a chance to intervene.</p><p>The magic banner formation was too slow, and the *Thunder Summoning Technique* required incantations.  Qin Sang made a snap decision, disregarding the risk of exposure, and used his fastest weapon, the ebony sword, to attack Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Even if he couldn't save Gongliang Yu, he couldn't let Dongyang Bo take the spirit puppet.</p><p>Qin Sang had been concealing his identity, not out of fear of Dongyang Bo, but to wait until he was strong enough, fully prepared to strike unexpectedly and decisively.</p><p>He couldn't hide any longer.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't fully understand the dangers of the spirit puppet, but he knew it couldn't fall into Dongyang Bo's hands. Otherwise, even with help, killing Dongyang Bo would be impossible.</p><p>Always decisive, he attacked with his sword.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, a seasoned warrior, reacted swiftly, not only blocking the surprise attack but also subtly avoiding repeating past mistakes.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Dongyang Bo's expression changed dramatically, uttering the same exclamation twice.</p><p>The first was upon seeing the phoenix wings on Qin Sang's back, recognizing the newly famous Mingyue Demon King.  Qin Sang had worn a mask since his Nascent Soul breakthrough, but the wings were his most obvious mark.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had heard countless rumors about the Mingyue Demon King: slaying Nascent Soul cultivators, battling Ye Laomo in the Abyssal Ruins and escaping unscathed, and even bringing back news from the Blood Lake expedition.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance rejoiced at having such a powerful ally.</p><p>However, some expressed concern that this rising star in the demon race might signal a resurgence, potentially surpassing humans in the future.</p><p>But the immediate threat of the Sinful Abyss, coupled with the demon race's weak foundation, meant it wasn't something one or two individuals could sway, and the matter was dropped.</p><p>The second exclamation came from recognizing the ebony sword.  He had once studied the *Chapter on Soul-Nourishing Swords*, but deemed the technique incomplete and ultimately unproductive, so he hadn't pursued it further. However, he remembered it clearly.</p><p>Over the years, only two people had achieved significant results with this technique.</p><p>One was a former disciple who forged a metal-elemental spirit sword, stubbornly refusing to change techniques, pursuing his own path, someone Dongyang Bo judged as incapable of reaching Nascent Soul.</p><p>The other was a pawn who had once escaped his schemes, who forged a wood-elemental spirit sword, attained the Golden Core many years ago, and now stood before him again.</p><p>The ebony sword was far superior now, but enough to confirm the identity of the wielder!</p>
