<h1>Chapter 1671:  Master Zi Lei</h1><p>The Eight Scenic Palace Lamp is to the Eight Scenic View as the Heavenly Hao Ancient Mirror is to the Heavenly Hao Tower.</p><p>However, the lamp possessed by Master Zi Lei is not a genuine Eight Scenic Palace Lamp, but his life-bound treasure.  The true Eight Scenic Palace Lamp is the foundation of the Eight Scenic View's mountain-protecting formation. In case of emergency, it can sever the earth's veins and teleport the entire sect to safety, preserving the core forces.  It allows them to transcend the mundane world and await a better time.</p><p>It's similar to the Wild Deer of Elder Lu, but surpasses it in every aspect.  Following ancestral teachings, Master Zi Lei would never dare to take the lamp out of the mountain. If anything were to happen to it outside, he would be a sinner against the Eight Scenic View. With this lamp, the Eight Scenic View possesses an unshakeable foundation for millennia to come.</p><p>However, to do so would require the Eight Scenic View to abandon its worldly possessions, sacrificing years of cultivation and becoming a secluded sect. Restoring its former glory would be extremely difficult and costly.</p><p>As the master of the Eight Scenic View, Master Zi Lei could not allow the sect to decline under his rule.</p><p>A replica possesses all the powers of the genuine lamp and can resonate with it. Each generation of masters chooses a replica as their life-bound treasure; it's a responsibility of the position.</p><p>However, Master Zi Lei's mastery of lightning spells is unparalleled, making his path incompatible with the Eight Scenic Palace Lamp. This life-bound treasure has become a hindrance, preventing him from breaking through to the Transcendence stage for many years.</p><p>This problem is not difficult to solve. The Eight Scenic View has had precedents; a trip to the Sword Tomb will suffice.</p><p>These factors combined led to the plot against the Immortal Palace.</p><p>Master Zi Lei now displays two powers of the Eight Scenic Palace Lamp.</p><p>One is called the Shadow-Reflecting Heart Lamp.  The light reflects, and the heart leaves its mark. This allows him to track his target's movements, creating a connection through energy. However, Master Zi Lei's lamp is inferior to the sect's, making it extremely difficult to track someone of equal cultivation like Wu Dao without being noticed.</p><p>A hasty encounter on the clifftop failed to capture an image. After the teleportation array battle and the mountain chase, two fierce battles, he only managed to lock onto Wu Dao during a moment of vulnerability.</p><p>After entering the mountain, Master Zi Lei remained silent, secretly observing Wu Dao’s movements through the Shadow-Reflecting Heart Lamp, using him as a guide.</p><p>This connection has limitations; it cannot capture every detail. Sensing Wu Dao's prolonged stay in a particular location deep within the mountain, Master Zi Lei deduced that he had found his target and immediately attacked.</p><p>The second power is the Profound Degree Rainbow Bridge.  Using the connection from the Heart Lamp, he can create a bridge and traverse the air, reaching his destination. This is only obstructed by extremely powerful formations that cut off the connection. The wind and formations on Emperor-Bestowed Mountain posed no obstacle.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The bridge landed directly before Wu Dao.</p><p>The Heavenly Hao Ancient Mirror was gone.</p><p>In a flash, the rainbow light disappeared, and Master Zi Lei stepped out, his gaze cold and fixed on Wu Dao.</p><p>The unexpected events startled even the resolute Wu Dao. Elder Fan only used the Heavenly Hao Ancient Mirror to locate him and disrupt his mind; his real body should still be outside.  Master Zi Lei's direct attack took him completely by surprise.</p><p>The Eight Scenic Palace Lamp hovered above Master Zi Lei's head, its eight sides each displaying a different wonder of the immortal realm, a breathtaking spectacle.  A radiant light circled him, repelling the surrounding mist.</p><p>Master Zi Lei's gaze locked onto Wu Dao, causing him to stiffen and raise his guard. He immediately alerted the Demon Child through the image in his sleeve.</p><p>Master Zi Lei surveyed the mountain cavern, his attention drawn to the seal below.  Since Elder Fan could see the relationship between the Five Elements Divine Prohibition and the Five Elements Crown, it was clear to Master Zi Lei. If the method to control the treasure lay within the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, why waste words with Wu Dao?</p><p>Without speaking, Master Zi Lei was about to act when he sensed something. His gaze, sharp as a blade, fell on Wu Dao's sleeve: "What are you doing?"</p><p>His voice boomed like thunder, a Xuanmen Daoist shout. Weaker cultivators would have their defenses shattered and be paralyzed with fear.</p><p>Exposed!</p><p>Wu Dao's heart trembled. He hadn't expected Master Zi Lei to be so perceptive.  Abandoning any hope of deception, he only thought, "Help me!"</p><p>A blinding golden light flashed.  Golden armor enveloped Wu Dao, and a dragon's roar erupted from his throat, generating tangible sound waves that surged toward Master Zi Lei.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren's expression darkened. The eight-scene palace lanterns blazed, not only dispelling the gloom but also overshadowing the golden armor's brilliance.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The lanterns swayed, rising high, radiating light, spinning faster.</p><p>As the lanterns spun, the light, far from being chaotic, instead conjured up wondrous scenes depicted on the lanterns themselves, projecting them into reality.</p><p>Moreover, the eight aspects of the illusion were no longer distinct.</p><p>Mountains and sea, heaven and earth.</p><p>Vast starry heavens, the chaotic mortal realm.</p><p>These distinctly different illusions now seamlessly merged, without the slightest incongruity, unfolding around Zi Lei Zhenren.</p><p>These scenes were, of course, illusions. Wherever the illusions extended, Zi Lei Zhenren's power reached, subtly influencing heaven and earth, drawing them into this space. Anyone falling here would be subservient to him, under his control.</p><p>Transformative cultivators were an exception.  Even the most perfect illusion remains an illusion, and Zi Lei Zhenren's cultivation was limited, unable to match the true harmony with heaven and earth achieved by a Transformative cultivator.</p><p>However, it was more than enough to deal with Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>The lantern illusions spread, like a miniature world reflected here.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's roar echoed, penetrating the lantern illusions without hindrance.  However, they were met with layers of illusory barriers; the roar couldn't reach Zi Lei Zhenren.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren, ignoring the roar, eyes gleaming with arcane light, formed hand seals, aiming them at Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>Instantly, the illusions surged like a vast torrent, about to engulf Zhu Wu Dao, even as the eight-scene palace lanterns' energy had already sealed him off.</p><p>Even through the golden armor, Zhu Wu Dao felt greatly constrained, sensing danger.</p><p>His reaction surprised Zi Lei Zhenren. He didn't try to break the energy seal or flee the lanterns' range, instead shattering the rocks beneath his feet and plummeting downwards.</p><p>But considering the nearly completed sealing array and the strange aura around Zhu Wu Dao, Zi Lei Zhenren reacted swiftly.</p><p>His fingers transformed into swords, lightning swords appearing.</p><p>Seizing and Killing Six Laws!</p><p>A lightning net, also a sword net, formed around Zhu Wu Dao.  It seemed like the void shattered, and interwoven lightning sword energy easily sliced through the golden armor's outer golden light.</p><p>The golden armor dimmed; sword intent pierced to the bone.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>A sharp sword sound emanated from within Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>Instantly, blinding golden light erupted.</p><p>This golden light wasn't from the armor, but a golden rainbow shooting from Zhu Wu Dao's head, containing a sword.</p><p>The sword was less than three inches long, yet incredibly sharp.</p><p>This sword strike contained not only soaring sword energy but also Zhu Wu Dao's cultivated sword intent. Anyone could see this was a rare and top-tier sword technique.</p><p>"Grand Origin Golden Gang Sword Scripture!"</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren's pupils constricted.</p><p>The Grand Origin Golden Gang Sword Scripture, a legacy of the Golden Aspect lineage of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, was supremely powerful and unmatched.</p><p>The sword's golden rainbow possessed such power that it surpassed even the Seizing and Killing Six Laws. This wasn't because Zhu Wu Dao's cultivation surpassed Zi Lei Zhenren's, but because the Grand Origin Golden Gang Sword focused on a single point, breaking through the sword-lightning net with pinpoint accuracy.</p><p>The Seizing and Killing Six Laws hesitated slightly, enough for Zhu Wu Dao to react. His golden armor swelled, manifesting a golden armored warrior's phantom that possessed Zhu Wu Dao, forcefully resisting the lightning sword attack and continuing his descent.</p><p>The golden rainbow's momentum continued, aiming to shatter the lantern illusions.</p><p>Unfortunately, his plan was unlikely to succeed.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren coldly snorted. The lantern illusions recoiled and overlapped, instantly becoming several times thicker. The golden rainbow, already weakened by the sword-lightning net, pierced in but was ultimately contained by the illusions, then extinguished as the illusions shifted.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The torrent of illusions flowed down irresistibly.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren's control was exquisite. The lantern illusions didn't impact the five-colored seal, instead unfolding over its surface.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao, unresisting, was pulled into the lantern illusions, but he'd achieved his goal, his foot now on the array, in close proximity to the seal.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren sensed something was wrong and wouldn't allow him the chance to perfect the array. The eight-scene palace lantern appeared above the illusions, its light like moonlight, illuminating Zhu Wu Dao, pinning him to the center of the illusions.  A terrifying pressure converged from all directions.</p><p>However, Zhu Wu Dao knew this. He hadn't attempted to directly perfect the seal. Anyone daring to be distracted in front of Zi Lei Zhenren was left only as bones.</p><p>He personally sent down the statue. Though the passage wasn't fully formed, it served a purpose.</p><p>Mozi had been waiting. A powerful force surged through the passage, entering the statue in Zhu Wu Dao's sleeve. The statue's eyes glowed increasingly red, taking on an uncanny light, clinging close to Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>The next moment, Zhu Wu Dao's face flushed, his hair disheveled, his black robe billowing as his power swelled.</p><p>His spirit sword, attuned to its master, hummed in response, its sound clear and resonant.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The spirit sword sang, a golden beam, brighter than before, shot straight into the sky, aiming directly at Zi Lei Zhenren!</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao suddenly looked up.  His eyes, at some point, had turned violet, each seeming to contain an endless demonic realm, incredibly eerie.</p><p>His gaze, like lightning, pierced through layers of illusion, striking Zi Lei Zhenren's spirit like a heavy hammer.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren's expression changed drastically. An unprecedented sense of crisis enveloped him. Those violet eyes were like two sharp swords, piercing his defenses, giving him the unsettling feeling his soul would be drawn in.</p><p>He had no doubt: if his spirit were captured by those violet eyes, he would be completely consumed.</p><p>They were clearly demonic eyes!</p><p>Was this still the Jinxiang heir?</p><p>Among the five branches of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, the Jinxiang lineage was the purest school of sword cultivators, untouched by outside doctrines, and especially wary of demonic paths.  This might be why the Jinxiang remnants chose to hide in the Tianhao Tower.</p><p>Even if the Jinxiang descendants, to conceal themselves, had to cultivate the Tianhao Tower's demonic arts, a true heir like Zhu Wu Dao couldn't possibly truly switch allegiances. Why then was his mastery of demonic arts so profound, seemingly surpassing his swordsmanship?</p><p>Moreover, as far as Zi Lei Zhenren knew, the Tianhao Tower didn't possess such a violet-eyed demonic technique!</p><p>How many secrets did Zhu Wu Dao hide!</p><p>Fortunately, Zi Lei Zhenren didn't expect to suppress Zhu Wu Dao with the Bajing Palace Lamp.</p><p>"Heavenly Purple Thunder, bestow upon me!"</p><p>The majestic voice, like the divine pronouncements of gods, shook the hearts of all who heard it, prompting an urge to prostrate themselves.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao was stunned.  Ripples appeared in his violet eyes for the first time. Within the illusion, among the stars, Zi Lei Zhenren stood in the void, purple thunderbolts crisscrossing the heavens, the illusion transforming into a realm of thunder.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren hung in the middle of the sky, surrounded by boundless purple thunder, unharmed, the thunder actively converging on him, forming a purple thunder crown above his head.</p><p>The crown slowly descended.</p><p>A thunder robe followed.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren, awe-inspiring and terrifying, transformed into a Thunder God!</p><p>…</p><p>While they were engaged, the Tianhao Ancient Mirror reappeared on the other side of the mountain.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren and Zhu Wu Dao clashed, Fan Laomo seizing the opportunity to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>At this time, Fan Laomo's true body was also rapidly rushing towards the mountaintop. Guided by the Tianhao Ancient Mirror, he didn't worry about getting lost in the wind煞, and the closer he got, the clearer the image reflected by the mirror became.</p><p>Within the mountain, the mirror seemed embedded in the stone wall, its light dim, its fluctuations minimal.</p><p>Remotely controlling the mirror, Fan Laomo could clearly see the details of the seal, making a new discovery.</p><p>This greatly surprised him.</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Prohibition, converging here, formed a seal, not the spirit pool he'd imagined for nurturing spiritual treasures. What was sealed beneath?</p><p>Or…</p><p>His thoughts raced. Fan Laomo dared not act rashly. After observing for a while, he made a hand seal, and struck his chest with a heavy palm.</p><p>"Ugh!"</p><p>Fan Laomo trembled, spitting out a mouthful of blood, all of which was absorbed by the mirror symbol.</p><p>The mirror symbol stained with blood, the Tianhao Ancient Mirror in the mountain became a blood mirror, a blood-red disc, falling lightly, settling precisely on the surface of the seal.</p><p>Then the ancient mirror began to melt, blood light slowly spreading.  Upon closer inspection, it was seen that strands of blood were extending from the mirror's surface, piercing the five-colored seal, specifically seeking the connections between the five colored lights.</p><p>This wasn't destroying the seal, but silently infiltrating it – the Tianhao Ancient Mirror's most powerful ability.</p><p>Fan Laomo didn't know what was sealed below, something the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect had seriously sealed away. Though many years had passed, out of caution, he still used this method to investigate.</p><p>Because the seal primarily targeted the inner demon, and Zhu Wu Dao had previously shattered the Jade Pavilion, affecting the Seven Constellations Sword Formation, and then used the statue to create a passage, prying open the seal, more or less causing an impact, the Tianhao Ancient Mirror found a way in, and its infiltration was quite effective.</p><p>On the Emperor's Grant Mountaintop.</p><p>Fan Laomo stopped at some point, sat cross-legged, beneath him was a black lotus, the Myriad Illusions Dark Lotus.</p><p>After sitting quietly for a moment, Fan Laomo closed his eyes. The dark lotus trembled slightly, its petals closing inward layer by layer.</p><p>As the petals closed, Fan Laomo's form shifted from solid to ethereal, finally becoming a wisp of mist, enveloped within the closed Myriad Illusions Dark Lotus.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A black light shot from the lotus heart, striking the mirror symbol.</p><p>Simultaneously, a point of black light appeared in the center of the Tianhao Ancient Mirror within the mountain, clearly a Myriad Illusions Dark Lotus.</p><p>As the Tianhao Ancient Mirror gradually infiltrated, the Myriad Illusions Dark Lotus also invaded the seal.</p><p>The Myriad Illusions Dark Lotus was Fan Laomo's life essence treasure, demonstrating his mastery of illusionary demonic arts; combined with the Tianhao Ancient Mirror, it exerted an incredible power.</p>
