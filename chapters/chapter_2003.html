<h1>Chapter 1994: A World Within a Flower</h1><p>White sand stretched across the coast.</p><p>A gentle sea breeze carried the foam and salty scent of the waves inland, while flocks of birds circled in the sky, chirping incessantly.  They would occasionally swoop down to the shore or water to peck at food, their movements swift and dramatic.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of blue light abruptly interrupted the scene, scattering the birds in alarm.</p><p>Moments later, a colossal shadow fell upon the land as a large ship appeared in the sky, sailing from the horizon, cleaving through the wind.</p><p>This ship was the Cloud Voyage Treasure Ship of the Cloud Capital.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged in his private chamber, his gaze passing through the protective barrier, observing the boundless ocean.</p><p>The Celestial Heavens Assembly had concluded.  Qin Sang wasn't concerned with the power struggles that had ensued.</p><p>The good news was that they had finally achieved their goal, obtaining a small pocket dimension using the蟠龙天柱 (Panlong Heavenly Pillar).</p><p>The process went even smoother than anticipated.</p><p>After presenting the Panlong Heavenly Pillar, there wasn't much resistance within the Celestial Heavens Sect.  The Yu Sect, using their influence, mediated the situation.  Combined with the efforts of Gu Yun Sou and Ying Zongzhu, Qin Sang secured the pocket dimension without much effort.</p><p>Many coveted the small pocket dimension, but nobody possessed a Panlong Heavenly Pillar. Even the most complete ruins couldn't sway the Celestial Heavens Sect.</p><p>Later, news circulated that sects from Lushong Island had participated in the Celestial Heavens Assembly.</p><p>They weren't there to pledge allegiance to the Celestial Heavens Sect; they were after the pocket dimension.</p><p>This indicated that there were likely other Panlong Ancient Array ruins outside Yue Du Bay.</p><p>The sheer scale of the Panlong Ancient Array was unimaginable; Yue Du Bay was just a part of it!</p><p>The value of the Panlong Heavenly Pillar was undoubtedly greater than anticipated, which explained why the Celestial Heavens Sect was willing to trade a pocket dimension for it.</p><p>A glimpse revealed the whole picture. Many harbored designs on the Panlong Ancient Array. Gu Yun Sou even regretted the hasty exchange of the Panlong Heavenly Pillar, believing it might hold greater secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't feel any regret.</p><p>To him, the Panlong Heavenly Pillar was an unexpected windfall, not something he had anticipated.  He was quite satisfied with acquiring a pocket dimension.</p><p>His foundation in the Great Thousand World was weak.  Even if the Panlong Ancient Array did hold significant secrets, he wouldn't have the strength to contend with the Celestial Heavens Sect.</p><p>Moreover, the Celestial Heavens Sect had spent over a thousand years searching for the Panlong Ancient Array and had likely found numerous Panlong Heavenly Pillars.  Their hope of using a single pillar to unlock the array's secrets and gain a first-mover advantage was practically impossible.</p><p>Furthermore, he had decided to leave and didn't want any complications.  Less trouble was always better.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang rubbed his fingers, feeling a smooth texture.</p><p>He held a token that looked neither like gold nor jade—the key to the entrance of the small pocket dimension.</p><p>The Celestial Heavens Sect named this pocket dimension the Azure Sky Cave Heaven.</p><p>“Senior, we've left the mainland of Yue Du Bay. Islands to the west are sparsely distributed. At our current speed, it will take another three days and two nights to reach Wan Luo Island.”</p><p>Gu Yun Sou, seated on the other side of the chamber, spoke, but in a different voice, addressing Qin Sang as Senior.</p><p>This 'Gu Yun Sou' was Yun Xi in disguise.</p><p>The real Gu Yun Sou had disembarked earlier, concealing himself—a precaution against being followed.</p><p>Treasure tempts the heart, especially a pocket dimension.</p><p>While in the Celestial Heavens Sect's possession, no one dared to covet the Azure Sky Cave Heaven. This might not be the case now.</p><p>“Maintain our current speed,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Yun Xi responded.  His master had instructed him to follow Qin Sang's orders before disembarking.</p><p>The sea and sky stretched endlessly before them.</p><p>The weather was excellent, the sun shining brightly, the sea shimmering.</p><p>The Cloud Voyage Treasure Ship sailed serenely through the air.  They encountered no obstacles. On the evening of the third day, a vast shadow appeared on the horizon.</p><p>As they approached, they discovered a large island. The shadow was cast by its mountains.</p><p>From afar, the island appeared almost devoid of plains, with towering, rugged peaks, the soil and rocks tinged with a faint dark red.</p><p>Most of the island's vegetation was similarly colored.</p><p>It was as if the island had been drenched not in rain, but in blood, giving it this appearance.</p><p>The cultivators enjoying the view from the ship's railing felt an inexplicable sense of unease and breathlessness.</p><p>Those with weaker resolve became restless and wanted to retreat to their chambers to cultivate and regain their composure.  Others subconsciously stopped smiling, their faces turning grave.</p><p>Among them, several cultivators in dark red robes smiled upon seeing the island.</p><p>They were disciples of Wan Luo Island.</p><p>Noticing the others' unusual behavior, the group exchanged glances, a smug look flashing in their eyes.  They worked together, casting a spell that manifested red light on their backs, forming snake-like shapes.</p><p>This strange action drew the attention of everyone else.</p><p>Instead of snakes, what appeared behind these Wan Luo Island disciples were the tendrils of a bizarre plant, winding like serpents, their tips resembling snake heads, opening gaping maws and spewing a cloud of dark red mist.</p><p>The mist spread across the deck, scattering seeds that floated towards everyone.</p><p>"Friends, don't worry," a Wan Luo Island disciple announced loudly. "The discomfort you felt was due to the island's great formation. Carry these spirit seeds, and you'll be fine."</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone caught the spirit seeds, and indeed, the unsettling feeling eased.</p><p>"Senior, Wan Luo Mountain is in sight," Yun Xi reported.</p><p>"Proceed directly to the island!"</p><p>Qin Sang went to the bow of the ship.</p><p>That day, after completing the transaction with Zhen Laomo, Zhen Laomo returned to Wan Luo Island to recover from his injuries, leaving his disciples behind.  After the ceremony, Qin Sang went to the trouble of escorting the Wan Luo Island disciples back to their island.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Shi Yun treasure ship sailed towards Wan Luo Island.</p><p>Just as they entered the airspace above Wan Luo Island, disturbances appeared in the void.  Visible to the naked eye, countless streaks of grey, thousands of feet long, spread across the sky, seeming to brew a terrifying storm.</p><p>"What's down there!"</p><p>Someone on the ship cried out.</p><p>From deep within the mountain range, a brilliant light suddenly burst forth, revealing several gigantic vines, thicker than mountains themselves, resembling enormous dragons, coiling and thrashing wildly in the sky.</p><p>The ends of these vines sprouted human faces, their hollow eyes staring intently at the ship.</p><p>Even the Yun Du Tian disciples, who had witnessed the Sacrificial Thunder Oath celestial phenomenon, felt their minds shaken by the sight of these vines.</p><p>One of the vines whipped towards the bow, coming within arm's reach. The cultivators on board felt immense pressure, falling silent in fear.</p><p>The Wan Luo Island disciples on board all knelt down, "Greetings, Master!"</p><p>"Thank you for your efforts, Daoist, for personally escorting us."</p><p>The human face on the vine spoke, in the voice of Zhen Laomo, "Zhen is recovering from injuries and cannot personally greet you. Please forgive me, Daoist."</p><p>"No problem, I'm not here to disturb your recovery," Qin Sang said, waving his hand. The ship slowly descended, flying towards the heart of Wan Luo Island.</p><p>The Shi Yun treasure ship docked at the Wan Luo Island gate. Tai Yi, Yu Lang, and the Yun Du Tian cultivators disembarked, seemingly intending to stay for some time.</p><p>Qin Sang was invited to follow the vine towards Zhen Laomo's cave.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang communicated with Zhen Laomo through sound transmission.  Zhen Laomo didn't ask much, readily agreeing to the proposal.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang left Wan Luo Island alone and secretly. The Shi Yun treasure ship and the Yun Du Tian cultivators remained on the island as a cover.</p><p>After checking his direction, Qin Sang stealthily headed southwest, towards Bi Kong Cave Heaven.</p><p>…</p><p>After flying an unknown distance, he finally found an uninhabited islet.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the island. He didn't wait long before a figure silently appeared beside him – Gu Yun Sou.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou shook his head slightly. "I didn't detect any signs of pursuit."</p><p>He looked around. "Master Yu and Master Ying haven't arrived yet."</p><p>"They should be here soon."</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>The two sat down on the ground. Qin Sang took out a stone radiating a clear light from his Qian Jun ring, holding it up for examination.  This stone was a fragment of the Heavenly River Reverse Killing Formation, which could help Qin Sang understand the formation.</p><p>Lately, Qin Sang had gradually begun to grasp some of the mysteries of the Heavenly River Reverse Killing Formation.  The star sea contains the Milky Way, with countless stars gathering there—the most brilliant place of starlight. Legend says it is a river in the heavens, and the Heavenly River Reverse Killing Formation draws upon only the power of these stars.</p><p>The waters of the Heavenly River are reversed, piercing heaven and earth, weighing more than ten thousand jun, making the destruction of mountains and seas seem trivial.</p><p>Compared to Qin Sang's Four Symbols Sword Formation, the Heavenly River Reverse Killing Formation has a certain "brute force" quality, unleashing the power of the stars all at once, lacking the subtle refinement of the twenty-eight mansions depicted in the Four Symbols.</p><p>But that doesn't mean the Heavenly River Reverse Killing Formation is crude; they are simply different approaches.</p><p>Since they both belong to the Stellar Dao, Qin Sang could still gain some insights, and his previous experiences also aided his understanding of the Heavenly River Reverse Killing Formation, so he quickly made some progress.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou knew Qin Sang was studying the formation and didn't disturb him.</p><p>The sea waves beat against the rocks on the shore.</p><p>Night turned to day.  In the early morning, Master Yu and Master Ying finally arrived.</p><p>They came together.</p><p>Master Yu bowed. "We kept you waiting, both of you. To prevent any accidents, Master Ying and I made several preparations, which delayed us."</p><p>"How is it?" Gu Yun Sou asked.</p><p>"No trackers found," Ying Zongzhu said, laughing after checking the surroundings. "Seems we were too cautious.  Anyone with ill intent would not only offend four cultivators at the Transcendent Void stage, but also risk incurring the wrath of the Jitian Sect. Besides, two of you just defeated the old zombie; your reputations are at their peak."</p><p>Gu Yunshou remained noncommittal, nodding. "Perhaps. I haven't heard of any rare treasures produced in Bkong Cave Heaven. They might have deemed the risk too high. But caution is always warranted."</p><p>With that, the four of them activated their escape techniques and continued flying southwest.</p><p>They flew over a vast ocean.</p><p>The weather seemed to be changing.</p><p>The wind picked up, and noticeable waves appeared on the sea's surface.  After flying for some time, the sky ahead grew dark, hinting at an approaching storm.</p><p>Gu Yunshou did a quick calculation and exclaimed in surprise, "So Bkong Cave Heaven is here!"</p><p>Ying Zongzhu looked over. "Have you been here before?  Over thirteen hundred years ago, I passed through this area. I found the frequent hurricanes in this sea region strange, so I investigated for several months, but found nothing.  I never imagined a small Cave Heaven was hidden here."</p><p>"Yes, I've heard that the weather in this sea area is volatile, but I didn't think much of it back then. I didn't know if it had anything to do with Bkong Cave Heaven."</p><p>Gu Yunshou and Ying Zongzhu exchanged stories of their travels.</p><p>From their combined experiences, they pieced together the landscape of this sea area.</p><p>West of Yue Du Bay, islands are sparse.  This sea area is even more so, with almost no place to land—vast and desolate.</p><p>Storms are frequent, the weather is harsh, and it's unsuitable for mortal life.  Because there are no benefits, cultivators don't usually come here.</p><p>As they spoke, the wind became even more ferocious.</p><p>Qin Sang's token glowed brightly, activated by his spiritual energy, sensing the precise location of the marker.</p><p>After flying several thousand miles further, Qin Sang's expression shifted, and he said, "Found it!"</p><p>His speed increased, and the other three quickly followed.</p><p>Following the token's guidance, Qin Sang dove into the sea, the water parting before him.</p><p>After descending to an unknown depth, faint glimmers appeared ahead.</p><p>It was an underwater mountain, with strange plants growing on it. Some were as large as trees, others like moss, but most were white flowers resembling orchids.</p><p>The four Transcendent Void cultivators swept their spiritual senses across the area, finding no intelligent spirit beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang landed halfway up the mountain and found a crevice in a rock, where a white flower grew.</p><p>The flower was in full bloom, its pale yellow stamens as thin as needles, exquisitely delicate.</p><p>The marker for Bkong Cave Heaven was inside the stamen.</p><p>This flower, growing in this precise location, seemed to contain a small world within its bloom.</p><p>"One flower, one world—truly not a falsehood!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed, and the others agreed.</p><p>The token soared, a green light flashing in the void, and the four disappeared.</p><p>As if passing through an invisible barrier, Qin Sang clearly perceived the change in the world around him, realizing that he had left the larger world and entered a smaller one.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>Torrential rain poured down.</p><p>Rain enveloped them from all directions, its intensity astonishing. In the mortal world, this would be a devastating disaster.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A deafening roar echoed from the sky, but it wasn't thunder.</p><p>"Conceal your auras!"</p><p>Qin Sang sensed something amiss, his face changing slightly as he issued a hushed warning.</p><p>Gu Yunshou and the other two reacted swiftly, suppressing their Transcendent Void cultivator auras.  The void had begun to tremble when they entered.</p><p>It was indeed a fragmented small world, and carelessness could accelerate its destruction.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky. Despite the heavy rain, there were no clouds, only a clear blue sky.</p><p>It was all water!</p><p>The source of the torrential rain was a line of gigantic waves, reaching the heavens, and crashing down from above after exhausting their force.</p><p>They now found themselves at sea, amidst a storm even more violent than outside.</p><p>In all directions, giant waves rose incessantly, without end.</p><p>The four chose a random direction and flew for a while, but couldn't see the edge of the storm; all of Bkong Cave Heaven was a world of storms.</p><p>Finally, they saw the continent of Bkong Cave Heaven.</p><p>Waves like high walls crashed continuously onto the land, relentlessly destroying it.</p><p>The rain also spread to the continent, turning much of the land into a lake, with mountain peaks emerging from the water to receive the rain's baptism.</p><p>"No wonder there are no mortals in Bkong Cave Heaven,"</p><p>Gu Yunshou sighed. Mortals couldn't possibly survive in such a place.</p><p>However, Bkong Cave Heaven wasn't devoid of life.  The continent was covered with various plants.</p><p>Due to the environment, there were no delicate grasses.  All the plants were exceptionally tall and stout.</p><p>They possessed large, umbrella-like canopies, and their roots, like pythons, clung firmly to the earth and rocks.</p><p>These plants' root systems were covered with thick, fine hairs, spreading across the ground and water, dense like a carpet of grass, allowing the land to withstand the scouring of the rain.</p><p>"There are plant spirits," Gu Yunshou said.</p>
