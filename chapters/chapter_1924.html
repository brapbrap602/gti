<h1>Chapter 1915: City God Temple</h1><p>Such a master, if they hailed from Cloud Metropolis Heaven, it wouldn't be surprising at all.</p><p>Cloud Metropolis Heaven's purge of demonic beings must have a deeper meaning. The Fire Domain needs to prepare in advance and try to fathom Cloud Metropolis Heaven's intentions.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Fu is overthinking it."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't turn his head, gradually walking further away.</p><p>Fu Xiao gazed at the receding figure, hesitation flickering across his face, but ultimately chose not to pursue.</p><p>……</p><p>Soon after, the cultivators belatedly realized that the previously rampant Sand Bandits had suddenly vanished without a trace.</p><p>As survivors were discovered and news spread, the story of the Sand Bandits' complete eradication gradually circulated throughout the desert and even into the Fire Domain.</p><p>Some curious individuals, emboldened, ventured to investigate the three mountain bandit strongholds.  They were met with a scene of carnage, the mountain walls smeared with blood and confessions of crimes.</p><p>Even in broad daylight, the place was as gloomy as the underworld.</p><p>These individuals took one look and hurried back down the mountain, not daring to linger.  Every time they recalled the scene, they were filled with lingering fear.</p><p>Then, more news emerged.  Traitors were discovered within some renowned sects, colluding with the Sand Bandits.  They too were purged, some sects even having their mountain gates crippled.</p><p>Most of these sects chose to close their gates, remaining tight-lipped about the affair.</p><p>Surprisingly, the three major sects of the Fire Domain didn't react at all.</p><p>The storm gradually subsided, and from beginning to end, no one knew who was responsible.</p><p>For a long time after, many cultivators remained grateful for the mysterious person's righteous deed.</p><p>The Sand Bandits' gruesome fate served as a warning to those with wicked intentions.  For a long period, no one dared to stir up trouble in the desert, and the atmosphere in the cultivation world became markedly more orderly.</p><p>It wasn't until a century later that a few scattered groups of Sand Bandits reappeared, only to be swiftly eradicated by a joint effort of the major Immortal Sects.</p><p>……</p><p>Crossing the desert, entering the wastelands, a touch of green finally came into view.</p><p>Beyond the wastelands lay undulating peaks and endless barren mountains. Not only could mortals not survive here, even cultivators were rarely seen.</p><p>A white cloud drifted leisurely.</p><p>Standing atop the cloud, Qin Sang gazed at the scenery below. Suddenly, he said, "Look at the flow of these rivers.  A few hundred miles further south, there will be signs of civilization.  We'll find a boat then and travel south by river."</p><p>Luo Hou had no objections, having diligently fulfilled his duties as a mount since descending the mountain.</p><p>Zhu Que suddenly became excited, fluttering up and down, incessantly asking, "Are there really so many delicious things in the mortal world?"</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang had been explaining worldly affairs to Xiao Wu.  Recalling Xiao Wu's interest in the food at the Gathering Immortals Pavilion, he had elaborated a bit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhu Que overheard.</p><p>"In terms of refined seasoning and precious ingredients, how can mortals compare to cultivators?  But food is the paramount necessity of the people.  Different places have different local customs and practices, and there will always be new and wondrous things to discover…"</p><p>As they spoke, the white cloud swept over the mountains.  Qin Sang noticed the terrain ahead gradually flattening out, the river widening.  Man-made structures began to appear along the riverbanks. He said, "There are people ahead. Let's go down."</p><p>Qin Sang cast a concealment spell.  The white cloud surged forward, then descended directly onto a mountain path along the riverbank.</p><p>The river's current was relatively calm.  A simple wooden dock stood on each bank, the submerged pilings showing obvious signs of decay, suggesting they had been there for some years.</p><p>From the docks, roads extended inland, narrowing as they went, finally branching off into several smaller paths that disappeared into the wilderness.</p><p>A covered boat was tied to each dock, both passenger ferries, seemingly with a clear division of labor.</p><p>The boatman on the east side was a thin old man, busily carrying firewood, fetching water, and cleaning the boat.  The boatman on the west side was powerfully built, leaning against the bow, legs crossed, squinting in the sun.</p><p>It wasn't time to set sail yet, and passengers waited on both docks.</p><p>The old man repeatedly smiled apologetically at the passengers, saying, "Soon! Soon!"</p><p>The passengers naturally didn't mind, some even offering to help.</p><p>The strong man couldn't be bothered to speak to the passengers, so no one interacted with him. The passengers looked towards the east bank with envy.</p><p>A sour smell emanated from the west side boat, but they didn't dare complain in front of the strong man. They could only cover their noses discreetly, worried about the upcoming journey.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally chose the east side boat, landing on a mountain path on the east bank and walking, leading his horse.</p><p>"Eh, a Daoist is coming."</p><p>"Where did a Daoist come from around here?"</p><p>"Oh my, what a pretty girl! Is she asleep on the horse?"</p><p>……</p><p>The passengers on the dock discussed Qin Sang's arrival amongst themselves.</p><p>As Qin Sang approached, they fell silent, offering friendly smiles.  Some even offered a clumsy Daoist bow.</p><p>There are deities above, and it's never wrong to treat Daoists with courtesy, regardless of their abilities.</p><p>Moreover, this Daoist, with flowing sleeves, possessed a certain otherworldly air, perhaps truly a Daoist of great attainment.</p><p>"Boatman, my horse is a little tired. Could you accommodate us?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked gently.</p><p>The covered boat was quite spacious, more than enough room for a horse.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The old man put down the firewood and rubbed his hands, looking troubled. "Daoist, I can waive your fare, but the horse…"</p><p>Although there weren't many passengers now, as they traveled downriver, stopping at multiple docks until they reached Beikuo County City, these were the only two boats.</p><p>People from both banks relied on them to get to the city, and the boats often became crowded past the halfway point.</p><p>"No need to waive the fare.  Let the horse rest.  We'll disembark when it gets crowded, alright?"</p><p>Qin Sang took out a few copper coins.</p><p>He didn't have copper coins, so he had taken a silver ingot and exchanged it with the old man from his money box.</p><p>"Well, alright.  There's really no need for the fare!"</p><p>The old man firmly refused.</p><p>Before long, the sun reached its zenith. The old man stacked the firewood neatly and called for the passengers to board.</p><p>The number of people on both banks was roughly the same.  When the Azure Horse boarded, the east side boat dipped noticeably lower in the water.</p><p>The boatman on the west side untied the ropes, gripped the oar, and with a powerful stroke, his covered boat cut through the water like a swift vessel, leaving a white trail on the river's surface, leaving them far behind.</p><p>The old man wasn't in a hurry at all, rowing leisurely, chatting and laughing with the passengers.</p><p>Their gazes drifted towards the stern from time to time.  Qin Sang and Xiao Wu sat on the deck, Zhu Que dozing on Qin Sang's shoulder, the Azure Horse standing beside them.</p><p>Such a combination naturally piqued everyone's curiosity, but no one dared to disturb them, fearing they might inadvertently offend the Daoist.</p><p>They had already assumed Qin Sang possessed genuine abilities, otherwise why would he dare travel with a young girl?</p><p>The river's course wasn't straight south.  After a while, it suddenly turned west, narrowing, and the current becoming more rapid, which saved the old man some effort.</p><p>Soon, the second dock came into view.</p><p>Only three people stood on the dock, including a boy about ten years old, a large bundle beside his feet.  Seeing the boat, he excitedly waved.</p><p>"Grandpa… Grandpa…"</p><p>The boy's childish voice carried over the water. The old man's face blossomed into a smile as he rowed a few quick strokes, bringing the boat to the shore. "Boy, did you buy it?"</p><p>"Mm-hmm!"</p><p>The boy nodded vigorously. "Uncle Zhao said the harvest was good recently, and he made lots of cured meat. It smells so good!"</p><p>Saying this, the boy hoisted the large bundle onto his back with a grunt.  Before the boat was fully docked, he jumped aboard in three quick steps, startling the old man, who hastily dropped the oar and reached out to steady him.</p><p>"Don't be reckless!"</p><p>The old man raised his hand, pretending to strike.</p><p>"Hee hee…"</p><p>The boy darted into the cabin like a little fish.  Soon, shouts and exclamations came from inside.</p><p>"Wow! Grandpa caught so many fish today…"</p><p>"Wow! There's even a Yellowtooth!"</p><p>"It's been so long since I've had Yellowtooth.  Last year's was so delicious, so plump!"</p><p>……</p><p>The boy exclaimed excitedly, but his movements were surprisingly deft.  He carried the stove and seasonings to the bow, retrieved the cleaned and gutted fish from the basket, and then went to the stern to fetch firewood.</p><p>"Wow!"</p><p>Suddenly seeing the Azure Horse, the boy couldn't help but gasp. "What a tall and mighty horse!"</p><p>What man wouldn't desire a fine steed, especially one as magnificent as this.</p><p>The boy's eyes shone with longing as he stared at the Azure Horse, then noticed Qin Sang and Xiao Wu.</p><p>When he saw Xiao Wu, the boy froze again, staring blankly for a moment.  Suddenly, his face flushed crimson.  He grabbed an armful of firewood haphazardly and scurried back to the bow, huddled next to his grandfather, and pointed towards the stern hesitantly. "Grandpa, is… is she blind?"</p><p>The old man was startled again. He glanced surreptitiously towards the stern, relieved to see no reaction. "Maybe her eyes are just uncomfortable.  Go cook, Grandpa's hungry."</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>The boy returned to the stove dejectedly and began cooking skillfully.  A man in blue robes from the cabin came out to help.</p><p>They took a piece of cured meat from the bundle, washed and sliced it, rendered the fat, and stewed it with river fish in a pot.  Soon, a tantalizing aroma filled the air.</p><p>While busy, the boy would occasionally steal glances towards the stern, his thoughts impossible to conceal.</p><p>The passengers in the cabin smiled kindly, making the boy blush again and turn away.</p><p>'Gurgle…'</p><p>The river fish and cured meat soup bubbled in the pot.</p><p>Fresh river fish, rich meaty aroma, the enticing fragrance drifted into the cabin and then towards the stern.</p><p>Zhu Que perked up instantly, staring intently at the bow, practically ready to dive into the pot and snatch a piece.</p><p>Xiao Wu twitched her nose, also turning to 'look' in that direction, but her face remained calm, just quietly 'watching.'</p><p>"This is the warmth of the mortal world…"</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the rapidly passing scenery along the riverbanks, a feeling of nostalgia rising within him.  He had almost forgotten the taste of mortal life.</p><p>The passengers' appetites were stirred.  They took out their prepared dry rations from their bundles and nibbled them with sips of water.</p><p>Then, the fish soup was ready.</p><p>It was a large iron pot, filled to the brim with fish soup, far too much for the grandfather and grandson to finish.</p><p>The boy took a string of large bamboo tubes from the side of the covered boat, filled them with fish soup, and carefully carried them into the cabin, offering one to a timid young girl.  He said brightly, "Sister, here you go."</p><p>"No, no, no…"</p><p>The girl's face was full of panic.  She waved her hands repeatedly, wanting to stand, but afraid of spilling the fish soup in the boy's hands.</p><p>"Drink it! Uncle Chen is a good man.  When the catch is good, he always makes fish soup and shares it with everyone, free of charge!  There's plenty of soup.  If you want more, just ask for another serving."</p><p>The man in blue robes also walked in, carrying fish soup, and cheerfully distributed it to everyone.  Only then did the girl dare to reach out and accept the bamboo tube.</p><p>The bamboo tube contained not only fish soup but also small, thumb-sized fish, which tasted much better eaten with the dry rations.</p><p>Using the opportunity of serving the soup, the boy stole another glance towards the stern.  He suddenly realized Xiao Wu was 'looking' back at him.  His face flushed red again, his hand trembling, almost spilling the fish soup, causing a few cries of alarm.</p><p>Then the boy realized that Xiao Wu probably couldn't see and was simply drawn by the aroma of the fish soup.</p><p>"So pitiful."</p><p>The boy thought to himself.  Seeing that neither Qin Sang nor Xiao Wu had taken out any food, his eyes darted around.  He ran to the bow, tugged at his grandfather's clothes, stood on tiptoe, and whispered something.</p><p>Seeing his grandfather nod, the boy jumped up happily and immediately filled two bamboo tubes with fish soup, carrying them to the stern and placing them beside Qin Sang.  Without a word, he ran back to the bow, grabbed a bowl, picked out the Yellowtooth fish, licked his lips, and with a determined look, placed it all in the bowl.  He then filled it with cured meat and fish, grabbed two flatbreads, and ran back, slightly out of breath.</p><p>"Grandpa sent these for you.  Eat."</p><p>The boy didn't dare look at Xiao Wu, addressing Qin Sang before turning and running away.</p><p>Zhu Que's eyes lit up, fixated on a piece of cured meat, about to snatch it, but Qin Sang rapped him on the head, causing him to chirp indignantly.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the bowl and led Xiao Wu to the bow.</p><p>The boy, who had been gobbling down his food, quickly lowered his head and took small bites of the flatbread.</p><p>"Thank you, Boatman."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed in gratitude. Seeing the old man wave his hands repeatedly, he smiled and said, "We wouldn't dare refuse the Boatman's kindness. But what's meat without wine? I have some humble wine with me. Please don't dislike it."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang reached into his robes and, as if performing a magic trick, produced a wine gourd.  He took two thin bamboo tubes, filled them with wine, and offered them to the old man.</p><p>"How can I accept this…"</p><p>The aroma of the wine was truly enticing.  The old man carefully took the bamboo tube, took a sip, and immediately felt a warmth spread through his limbs and bones. His body felt lighter. The chill he had accumulated from years of working on the river seemed to dissipate.</p><p>"Good wine! This wine… isn't cheap, is it?"</p><p>The old man asked softly.</p><p>"I wander the world, needing wine to warm myself on my journeys. I brew some myself with gathered herbs.  It costs nothing." Qin Sang added a piece of cured meat to Xiao Wu's bowl.  Xiao Wu chewed gently, savoring the flavor, coarser than the Gathering Immortals Pavilion, but uniquely delicious.</p><p>"Ah! It's medicinal wine!" The old man glanced at his grandson, feeling a little reluctant to drink it.</p><p>In the future, his grandson would take over this trade.  Having this wine to ward off the cold would prevent him from suffering the same ailments as he had.</p><p>"This wine isn't strong.  Even children can drink it.  It strengthens the body. Just a small sip each time."  Qin Sang stood up, picked up an empty waterskin, and filled it with wine. "No one has appreciated my craft before.  Since you enjoy it, Boatman, I'll give you some more."</p><p>"Enough! Enough! Thank you, Daoist! Thank you, Daoist!" The old man was overwhelmed with gratitude.</p><p>The boy wasn't interested in the wine, quickly finishing his food.  Xiao Wu had been sitting opposite him, and after a while, he grew bolder.  "Are you done eating?  Grandpa bought me lots of toys in the city.  Do you want to play?"</p><p>"Play?"</p><p>Xiao Wu tilted her head, looking puzzled.</p><p>"Go ahead.  Do as he does." Qin Sang patted Xiao Wu's head.</p><p>Xiao Wu obediently stood up. The boy retrieved a treasure chest from the cabin, filled with all sorts of toys.</p><p>Qin Sang chatted with the old man about local customs and practices, while keeping an eye on Xiao Wu.</p><p>"This one!  You do it like this…  Fun, right?"</p><p>The boy was elated, taking out each toy and showing Xiao Wu how to play with it.</p><p>Xiao Wu's expression remained indifferent.  Even after all the toys had been explored, not a single smile graced her face.</p><p>The boy scratched his head in confusion.  He glanced towards the side of the boat, where a bamboo fish spear was tied with rope.  His eyes lit up, and he pulled Xiao Wu's sleeve, leading her to the edge of the boat.</p><p>"My grandpa made this for me himself. I've speared several fish with it!"</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>The fish spear entered the water, predictably spearing nothing.</p><p>The boy pulled the spear back, handed it to Xiao Wu, and positioned himself behind her, his gaze sharp, fixed on the river's surface.  "When I tell you to let go, you let go… Let go!"</p><p>'Thud!'</p><p>The river surface churned with blood.</p><p>The boy's jaw dropped, his eyes wide.</p><p>Xiao Wu's small face was bathed in sunlight, a faint, almost imperceptible smile playing on her lips, pure and innocent.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow slowly furrowed.</p>
