<h1>First Thousand Three Hundred and Ninety-Sixth Chapter Ascending Spirit Rite</h1><p>Being in possession of the original Wu Clan's Natal Insect Gu secret art, Qin Sang was not interested in the Hundred Flowers Valley's modified inheritance.</p><p>He was curious about how much Hundred Flowers Valley knew after the Natal Insect Gu advanced to the Fourth Transformation!</p><p>Low-level disciples of Hundred Flowers Valley couldn't possibly understand these secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang lost interest after contacting a few disciples. After reading the scriptures in the Scripture Repository, he returned to his bamboo building to cultivate in silence, awaiting Lan Jingsi's news.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang took out the ice casket again, trying to break the seal.</p><p>The result remained the same, progress was slow.</p><p>He wasn't discouraged at all. The stronger the seal, the more precious the treasure, making it worth looking forward to.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>The forbidden ground of Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Lan Jingsi sat cross-legged on a prayer mat, her figure merging into the darkness, a scene of tranquility.</p><p>In front of her, a complex and unusual spirit array was set up, shaped like an altar.</p><p>Before long, Lan Jingsi raised a hand, her jade finger lightly tapping the center of the spirit array.</p><p>The spirit array lit up with a burst of white light, emitting invisible fluctuations, the light waxing and waning.</p><p>After a few breaths, it returned to darkness, everything as usual.</p><p>Lan Jingsi's expression remained unchanged, continuing to meditate.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Lan Jingsi repeated the same technique.</p><p>This time, a new change finally appeared.</p><p>The white light trembled, rapidly converging towards the center of the spirit array, gathering into a ball of light.</p><p>Then, a man's voice came from within the light sphere.</p><p>"Junior Sister..."</p><p>Lan Jingsi opened her eyes, looking at the light sphere, and said repeatedly, "Senior Brother, have you come out from inside? What was the result?"</p><p>"Just probing the periphery... haven't truly entered yet... not very optimistic..."</p><p>Perhaps due to the distance being too great, the voice on the other side sounded a bit blurry, intermittent.</p><p>"What happened... to use the precious Heavenly Hearing Talisman... only three left..."</p><p>Anxious emotion was transmitted through the voice.</p><p>Seeing her Senior Brother misunderstand, Lan Jingsi quickly said, "Senior Brother, don't worry, nothing happened in the valley! A few days ago, Fellow Daoist Feng brought someone who wanted to visit Senior Brother..."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Feng's friend... what kind of person..."</p><p>After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn.</p><p>Lan Jingsi flew out of the forbidden ground, heading straight for the bamboo building where Qin Sang was staying.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed her arrival and immediately opened the bamboo building's restrictions, inviting Lan Jingsi in.</p><p>"Just received Senior Brother's reply," Lan Jingsi didn't beat around the bush, getting straight to the point, "Senior Brother said he can reveal to Fellow Daoist... that his spirit insect advanced to the Fourth Transformation by relying on a secret technique."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, not expecting it to be so easy. Despite his delight, he didn't let his guard down, saying solemnly, "Does Fellow Daoist Mu have any requests?"</p><p>Lan Jingsi shook her head, "Fellow Daoist, please allow me to finish explaining the pros and cons of this secret technique."</p><p>Qin Sang listened attentively.</p><p>He heard Lan Jingsi say, "This technique is called Ascending Spirit Rite. Its essence is to use external objects and forces to stimulate the potential of the spirit insect, forcibly helping it leap to a higher realm."</p><p>Ascending Spirit Rite.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that he hadn't heard of this kind of secret technique on the Wu God Continent.</p><p>Using external objects to stimulate the spirit insect's potential, would it cause serious damage to the spirit insect?</p><p>If it came at the cost of harming its future, Qin Sang would definitely hesitate.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could voice his concerns, Lan Jingsi took the initiative to explain, "Using the Ascending Spirit Rite for the first time won't severely affect the spirit insect, and there are ways to compensate for it. However, using it continuously will not only greatly reduce the success rate, but the spirit insect will also suffer irreversible damage. Even when using the Ascending Spirit Rite for the first time, the success rate is less than twenty percent, and that's with our Hundred Flowers Valley cultivators, after making ample preparations. Fellow Daoist performing the Ascending Spirit Rite on the Fire Jade Centipede, the chances of success are definitely lower than ours!"</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't deterred by her words and immediately asked, "Can the Ascending Spirit Rite only be used to advance to the Fourth Transformation? How can the success rate of the Ascending Spirit Rite be increased?"</p><p>Through Lan Jingsi's words, Qin Sang heard other implications and his heart fluttered.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley cultivators have a higher chance of success with the Ascending Spirit Rite than outsiders, most likely because they cultivate Natal Insect Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang also happened to have Natal Insect Gu!</p><p>Moreover, he was indirectly inquiring under the guise of the Fire Jade Centipede, his true goal being to find a way to help the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Whether the Fire Jade Centipede could advance wasn't important.</p><p>If the Heavenly Eye Butterfly could use the Ascending Spirit Rite to improve, even if it was only a small realm within the Fourth Transformation, it would be an extraordinary gain!</p><p>"Fellow Daoist's first question, I haven't really thought about it. The past masters of Hundred Flowers Valley have all used the Ascending Spirit Rite for spirit insects advancing to the Fourth Transformation, and there hasn't been a precedent for using it after the Fourth Transformation. Howeverâ€¦"</p><p>Lan Jingsi pondered for a moment and said, "When the founding master passed down the Ascending Spirit Rite, they didn't specify that it could only be used to break through to the Fourth Transformation. The idea of stimulating potential for advancement, presumably, is valid in any realm. The difference is just whether the secret technique for stimulating potential is exquisite or not, and the value of the external objects used. The spiritual objects required for the Ascending Spirit Rite are all quite valuable, so presumably it would also have an effect on a small realm within the spirit insect's Fourth Transformation."</p><p>After a pause, Lan Jingsi added, "To increase the chances of success, one can only start from oneself. The closer the master and the spirit insect are, the more intimate and trusting the spirit insect is towards the master, the more likely it is to succeed. In addition, the level of the master's own cultivation will also have an impact."</p><p>As she said this, Lan Jingsi glanced at Qin Sang, "To be frank, my own spirit insect is still at the peak of the Third Transformation, and I plan to wait until at least the peak of the Initial Stage of the Nascent Soul realm before considering helping it break through. Fellow Daoist is already in the Mid Stage of the Nascent Soul realm, so there's no need to worry about cultivation. But I don't know what method Fellow Daoist used to subdue the spirit insect, and I don't know how close the connection between you is."</p><p>Qin Sang asked knowingly, "The Hundred Flowers Valley's inheritance is unique in the cultivation world, could this humble Daoist perhaps learn a thing or two from it?"</p><p>Lan Jingsi said apologetically, "It's not that we're unwilling, but the Hundred Flowers Valley's techniques are special and have no value for cultivators above the Golden Core stage."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and didn't press the issue further.</p><p>On the surface, he was pondering, but in his heart, he was overjoyed.</p><p>He didn't expect that, having just arrived in the North Sea, there would already be a lead regarding the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Lan Jingsi's wording just now was 'leap', not simply break through, so does that mean it doesn't strictly require cultivating to the peak of the current realm?</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet seen the contents of the Ascending Spirit Rite with his own eyes, so he couldn't judge.</p><p>If it could help the Heavenly Eye Butterfly improve, even if it was just one realm, it would be enough.</p><p>Without Corpse Flower Blood Amber and Soul Shadow, Qin Sang still didn't know how he would break through to the Late Stage of the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>Helping the Heavenly Eye Butterfly as soon as possible, catching up to his own realm, due to the characteristics of Natal Insect Gu, it would be able to provide assistance when breaking through in the future, which would be of great significance.</p><p>Every bit of improvement is precious!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, and he was already determined to obtain the Ascending Spirit Rite.</p><p>However, he knew that things certainly weren't that simple, and he didn't directly ask about the Ascending Spirit Rite. Instead, he changed the topic and asked, "Valley Master Mu should have something to instruct this humble Daoist, right?"</p><p>Lan Jingsi said solemnly, "Senior Brother instructed me to convey a message: if Fellow Daoist Mingyue wants to learn about the Ascending Spirit Rite, he hopes that you won't mind making a trip to the Boundless Sea. Senior Brother wants to meet with Fellow Daoist."</p><p>As she spoke, Lan Jingsi took out a jade slip containing a sea chart.</p><p>She placed the sea chart on the table, allowing Qin Sang to decide for himself.</p>
