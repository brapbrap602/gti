<h1>Chapter 425 Kanli Golden Elixir</h1><p>“Disciple Qin Sang greets Elder Qi!”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed deeply upon seeing Qi Yuanshou.</p><p>Nearly thirty years had passed since their last meeting, and Qin Sang wondered if Qi Yuanshou's cultivation had advanced.  To him, Qi Yuanshou seemed no different than before, his aura just as unfathomable.  All Core Formation cultivators felt the same to Qin Sang.  Facing Qi Yuanshou was like facing a towering mountain; the gap between Core Formation and Foundation Establishment was vast, making it difficult to discern Qi Yuanshou's true strength. Qin Sang wondered if reaching the Pseudo Core Formation stage would change that.</p><p>Lost in his thoughts, Qin Sang heard Qi Yuanshou's command and rose to take a seat.</p><p>“You've broken through to late-stage Foundation Establishment and kept it hidden.  If I hadn't summoned you back, how long did you plan to stay out there? Do you not want the Kanli Golden Elixir?”</p><p>Qi Yuanshou’s gaze was sharp as he fixed his eyes on Qin Sang, but his tone was light, devoid of accusation.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't hide it from Qi Yuanshou. Seeing no reproach in the elder's demeanor, he breathed a sigh of relief and quickly explained, “Reporting to Elder, this disciple only recently broke through and my cultivation is unstable. I feared I would jeopardize the Elder’s important matters…”</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>Qi Yuanshou waved his hand dismissively.  From the depths of the hall, a jade box flew out and landed before Qin Sang.</p><p>“This Kanli Golden Elixir is a reward for disciples who have reached late-stage Foundation Establishment and are qualified to attempt Core Formation. It can be of some assistance in that process.</p><p>“At your age, Pseudo Core Formation is well within your reach. I should have waited until you reached that stage to give you the Kanli Elixir, but your cultivation method is unique, requiring constant outside training. You may not have had time to return for it.</p><p>“The Kanli Golden Elixir's effects are limited. Among spirit objects that aid Core Formation, it's considered mid- to low-tier. Open it and have a look.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s hands trembled slightly as he opened the jade box.</p><p>Inside, nestled on a bed of silk, lay a spirit elixir the size of a longan fruit!</p><p>The elixir was entirely gold, radiating a dazzling light that bathed the hall in a golden glow.</p><p>At Shaohua Mountain, disciples qualified to attempt Core Formation would receive a Kanli Golden Elixir. Though Qi Yuanshou spoke of it casually, for rogue cultivators, a mid- to low-tier Kanli Golden Elixir was still a treasure beyond their reach. It was rumored that Shaohua Mountain had discovered a medicinal garden within a secret realm in the Ancient Battlefield, and it was from this garden that the main ingredient for the Kanli Elixir was harvested, allowing the sect to generously reward its disciples.</p><p>The Kanli Golden Elixir didn't exude a strong fragrance, but at its apex was a tiny vortex swirling with distinct black and white energies, resembling a dragon and a tiger.</p><p>A dragon and a tiger born from the elixir, vivid and lifelike, a truly wondrous sight.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang mesmerized by the Kanli Golden Elixir, Qi Yuanshou’s voice deepened in warning, “Don't think that obtaining a Kanli Golden Elixir guarantees success.  In truth, very few achieve Core Formation by relying on it alone.  This Qi achieved Core Formation thanks to a mid-high-tier spirit object bestowed upon me by the Patriarch, coupled with years of arduous cultivation. I was fortunate to succeed.  With your talent…”</p><p>Qin Sang was inwardly surprised. Qi Yuanshou's Core Formation was aided by a spirit object from Patriarch Dongyang, and perhaps even guidance. He wondered what meritorious deeds Qi Yuanshou must have performed to earn the Patriarch’s favor.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou paused, seeming to struggle with his words, “You’ll have to diligently search for other spirit objects, preferably high-tier or top-tier ones. Your success depends on your own destiny.”</p><p>“Thank you for your guidance, Elder. This disciple understands!”</p><p>Qin Sang carefully stored the Kanli Golden Elixir.</p><p>Observing Qin Sang's composure, unfazed by his words, Qi Yuanshou nodded approvingly and proceeded to the matter at hand. "I called you back with the intention of assigning you, along with disciples from the Taiyi Elixir Sect, to guard a spirit stone mine. But since you've reached late-stage Foundation Establishment, and your 'Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter' is unique and grants you formidable combat prowess, it would be a waste of your abilities to confine you to a spirit stone mine…”</p><p>Qi Yuanshou fell into contemplation.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not interrupt the Elder’s thoughts, waiting patiently for his orders. He wouldn’t mind guarding a spirit stone mine; it would provide a peaceful environment for cultivation, free from distractions. However, he knew he had no say in Qi Yuanshou's decision.</p><p>After a moment, Qi Yuanshou’s eyes lit up. "Perfect. The sect has a medicinal garden in the Cloudmist Great Marsh that requires manpower. The spirit herbs are nearing maturity, and the sect plans to temporarily close the garden once they are ready. This is a crucial period. The sect currently lacks available personnel, so you are the ideal candidate…”</p><p>Qi Yuanshou produced a jade slip. "This is a map of the medicinal garden.  The spirit herbs cultivated within aren't particularly rare, but a few serve as supplementary ingredients for the Kanli Golden Elixir. If they were to fall into the hands of the Heavenly Alliance, it would require considerable effort to find replacements.  The garden’s location is highly secluded, and under normal circumstances, shouldn't be discovered. Be cautious.  While the spirit herbs are valuable, your life is more important. Don't force the issue if the situation becomes unfavorable. There are a few disciples already stationed at the garden; they are now under your command.”</p><p>“This disciple obeys!”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the jade slip, memorized its contents, and took his leave.</p><p>With Qi Yuanshou's urgent orders, Qin Sang didn't dare delay. He left a message talisman for Zhuang Yan explaining the situation and departed that very night.</p><p>However, he didn't rush on his journey. He first went to the Earth Sinkhole.</p><p>The Corpse Puppet Bag had accumulated quite a few corpses, including the Pseudo Core Formation cultivator, Silver Flame.</p><p>The corpse of a Pseudo Core Formation cultivator, while inferior to a living corpse, could be refined into a formidable Corpse Soldier.</p><p>The situation within the Cloudmist Great Marsh was volatile and unpredictable. Qin Sang knew that even a lion must exert its full strength against a rabbit. The cultivation world was teeming with experts, and thorough preparation was essential.</p><p>He patiently remained in the Earth Sinkhole, refining all the Corpse Soldiers before setting off on his journey.</p><p>The medicinal garden was located deep within the Cloudmist Great Marsh, in a remote area.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled discreetly, opting not to use the Nether Cloud. While this artifact could conceal his presence, it wouldn’t fool a true expert, potentially inviting unwanted attention.</p><p>Midway through his journey, something occurred to Qin Sang, and he changed direction.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang arrived at a small island, hovering in the air with a grim expression.</p><p>This was the island where he had laid Qingting and her husband to rest.</p><p>Now, the island was unrecognizable!</p><p>The protective formations were broken, cliffs had collapsed, and the sculptures and graves were destroyed. What was once a final resting place for two lovers had become a desolate ruin.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that war would inevitably destroy much that was beautiful, but he hadn't expected this island to be among the first casualties.</p><p>The last vestiges of Qingting and her husband, not eroded by time but destroyed by another’s hand, now existed only in Qin Sang’s memory.</p><p>He cursed the perpetrator, who, knowing their actions were despicable, had used brute force to obliterate the island, leaving no trace behind. In the chaotic Cloudmist Great Marsh, there was no way to find the culprit.</p>
