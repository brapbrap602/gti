<h1>Chapter 1895: Sword Domain</h1><p>Omens Appear!</p><p>In an instant, the ambient spiritual energy coalesced into a surging spiritual tide, vast and imposing.  The spiritual energy from afar was also affected, birthing countless orbs of spiritual light that collided in all directions before being swallowed by the tide, forming an even grander wave.</p><p>This world was stirred by Qin Sang.</p><p>It resembled the celestial phenomenon accompanying Qin Sang's breakthrough to the Divine Transformation stage, but in terms of both momentum and scale, it was incomparable.</p><p>The breathtaking display of radiant light was fleeting.</p><p>Wind and thunder erupted, shattering the serenity of the Divine Court.  Dark clouds roiled, and ethereal flames of unknown origin appeared endlessly, filling the void.</p><p>Infernal Fire Arrives!</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation descends.</p><p>Though Qin Sang was prepared, the sudden onslaught of intense poison and the searing infernal fire overwhelmed him, contorting his face.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>A chilling wind howled, and the clouds shifted ominously.  The infernal fire stretched endlessly.  At its heart, Qin Sang immediately felt the excruciating burn.</p><p>This sensation was familiar—he had faced this before, but this was undoubtedly the most perilous.</p><p>In past tribulations, the infernal fire was the weakest of the three calamities.  With his powerful physique, overcoming it was not difficult.</p><p>Now, however, he was completely unprepared and had to simultaneously combat the serpent venom within him.</p><p>However, having successfully broken through to the Void Refinement stage, Qin Sang had undergone another transformation, making the accumulated venom less of a threat.</p><p>Without hesitation, he forced out the remaining power of the妖丹 , and then rapidly performed hand seals.</p><p>The Great Vajra Wheel Seal and the *Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele* were activated, transforming him into a Vajra Glass body and merging with a spirit wood form.</p><p>Qin Sang's skin became rough, resembling a tree spirit. His appearance was bizarre, yet golden light flowed through his body, adding a touch of Buddha-like serenity.</p><p>The effects of the two secret techniques were immediate, and Qin Sang's expression eased slightly.</p><p>In this brief moment, the infernal fire had already burned from his湧泉穴  to his泥垣宮 , scorching his five internal organs and causing immense pain.</p><p>He used the power of these two techniques to withstand the infernal fire.</p><p>Enduring the excruciating pain, Qin Sang managed to divert his attention to dealing with the serpent venom.</p><p>The accumulated venom was forced out, condensing into a poison pearl in his palm before dissipating.</p><p>In this haste, he couldn't eliminate all the venom, but his condition improved significantly, allowing him to focus on the infernal fire tribulation.</p><p>Infernal fire could refine the body.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not entertain such a thought.  Surviving the Void Refinement breakthrough and the heavenly tribulation was already a stroke of incredible luck!</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>Smoke puffed from Qin Sang's mouth and nose, and flames erupted from his eyes and ears.  The infernal fire consumed his flesh, organs, and marrow.</p><p>The intense pain caused his body to tremble; the infernal fire was like a bone-grinding blade, tearing and shredding him apart.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had cultivated his physical body alongside his cultivation, possessing two superior secret techniques unattainable by many cultivators of his realm.</p><p>After some time, Qin Sang’s mind calmed slightly; at least he wouldn't perish in the infernal fire tribulation!</p><p>Wave after wave of agony assaulted Qin Sang's almost numb consciousness, as if he had been repeatedly torn apart and rebuilt. Finally, the infernal fire showed signs of weakening.</p><p>Having overcome the infernal fire tribulation, the most significant hurdle of the three calamities, Qin Sang felt confident about the remaining two.</p><p>The tribulation process was also a process of gradual strengthening. The sensation was different now. Qin Sang seized the opportunity, forcing out more of the venom, which now posed no further threat.</p><p>Gale-force winds followed the infernal fire.</p><p>If Qin Sang had sealed the Jade Buddha, the gale force winds would not have been able to invade his soul, and he could have easily passed this tribulation.</p><p>But he did not. If the Heavenly Court was observing him, it would reveal the existence of the Jade Buddha.  The power of the Thunder Ancestor shattering the Jade Buddha’s flaws also, in a way, prevented its exposure.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how effective this was, but he couldn't not do it.</p><p>Naturally, he still used the Jade Buddha to weaken the gale-force wind tribulation.</p><p>Similarly, in the upcoming lightning tribulation, Qin Sang didn't intend to let the Sky-Eyed Butterfly appear, to avoid inviting greater calamity.</p><p>Besides, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly was only in the mid-fifth stage, too weak.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>…</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The heavenly thunder finally arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, lightning illuminating his pupils.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the side, where the pool of blood still hadn't escaped from the heart demon.</p><p>However, the blood was writhing more violently, occasionally forming a humanoid outline, indicating that the person inside was regaining consciousness.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts flickered.  The Yunyou Sword shot back, spinning before him, then pierced the descending heavenly tribulation, flying towards it!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Sword and lightning clashed.</p><p>A brilliant sword light, surging with power, pierced the heavenly thunder, its momentum faintly overshadowing the thunder's might.</p><p>The first heavenly thunderbolt fell before the sword!</p><p>Aside from the Yunyou Sword, Qin Sang only used the Mingshan Armor for protection, not deploying any other spiritual treasures.  He closed his eyes; within his mind, the scriptures of the "Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang" and a sword light alternated.</p><p>This sword light was the final strike from his 'sparring' with Tian Yue Shang Ren, leaving a deep impression. Entering the Transcendent Realm, he realized this was no ordinary strike; it held boundless profundity.  His previous cultivation was insufficient; he only found the sword light remarkably skillful, failing to grasp its essence.  Tian Yue Shang Ren truly conveyed the Dao through the sword, profound meaning in simple words!</p><p>Qin Sang had intended to use other techniques like the Five Thunder Heaven Heart True Seal and others, combining them with his swordsmanship to break the thunder; instead, he became immersed in the Dao of the sword.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword soared, shattering thunderbolts under its blade.  Regardless of the mighty heavenly might, I'll break it with a single sword!</p><p>Qin Sang finally displayed a hint of a sword cultivator's demeanor.  His sword intent became increasingly pure, using the tribulation thunder as his opponent to hone his skills.  Achieving enlightenment during the tribulation thunder – few in the world could accomplish this.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that after breaking through to the Transcendent Realm, the only sword formation in the "Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang" – the Seven Souls Killing Formation – had undergone subtle changes.  The swordsmanship contained within the sword light, while different from the "Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang," held similarities, acting like a guide to help him understand the Seven Souls Killing Formation.  In a short time, he made astonishing progress.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>…</p><p>The tribulation thunder intensified; lightning continued to engulf the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly moved, manipulating sword seals, and instantly separating seven illusory figures, transforming into seven sword spirits.</p><p>Seven sword spirits surrounded Qin Sang, each appearing as an independent being, each wielding different sword techniques.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Seven sword lights consecutively plunged into the lightning.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword, continuously pounded by heavenly thunder, received support, its momentum surging.  The sword's cry shook the heavens; the spiritual sword seemed to possess heaven-shattering power, instantly splitting the heavenly thunder!</p><p>This wave of tribulation thunder was extinguished.  The lightning in the tribulation clouds subsided, seeming to stagnate due to the sword's might.</p><p>The tribulation clouds seemed enraged, immediately unleashing even more terrifying thunder.  Thunder rained down.</p><p>From beginning to end, Qin Sang stood defiantly beneath the tribulation clouds, never yielding!</p><p>The time he had for comprehension was too short.  Occasionally Qin Sang still had to use the Five Thunder Heaven Heart True Seal, the Four Multiplied Serpent Seal, and others, combining them with swordsmanship.</p><p>Finally, the last tribulation thunderbolt descended, unleashing the full might of the tribulation clouds, its oppressive power overwhelming.</p><p>Qin Sang erupted with astonishing sword intent. Seven sword spirits transformed into swords, merging into the Yunyou Sword.  The Yunyou Sword, absorbing the seven souls, trembled slightly; the world's energy frantically gathered, creating the same phenomenon as his breakthrough, transforming into a magnificent giant sword.  Qin Sang had witnessed Tian Yue Shang Ren use this technique – then illusory, now real!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sword moved towards the heavens, responding to the heavenly thunder.  The wind and clouds changed color instantly; sword energy and lightning formed a terrifying storm above Qin Sang's head, shattering the remaining tribulation clouds.</p><p>…</p><p>The storm gradually subsided. The tribulation thunder dissipated, leaving only the Yunyou Sword, quietly suspended in the void.  Qin Sang also fell silent, eyes tightly shut, motionless, his expression constantly shifting.</p><p>He waited for the Heart Demon Tribulation.  As expected, the heart demon did not appear.</p><p>Qin Sang worried about the Outer Realm Demons.  This was one of the greatest dangers of his breakthrough.  Being targeted by them, they might take advantage of the tribulation, even descending themselves!  If the situation weren't urgent, Qin Sang would have dealt with this hidden danger before his breakthrough, but now he had to risk his life.</p><p>He waited for a while, with no response.</p><p>“The Outer Realm Demons don't seem to have come…” Qin Sang thought.  Not only did the demon that had targeted him not come, there were no other demons.</p><p>“Could it be because of the blood crystal?  Was the demon severely injured or killed by it, or, injured, did it fear the blood crystal, and dare not descend directly? Were other demons also deterred…” Qin Sang guessed, never expecting that the enemy would resolve this hidden danger for him.</p><p>He didn't know whether this was good or bad, whether it might further enrage the demons, causing them to return with greater force.  Regardless, this situation was extremely favorable for Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>His eyes slightly opened. Qin Sang's gaze, initially confused, instantly became sharp, fixed on the blood pool. His gaze was like a sword, killing intent revealed!</p><p>The Yunyou Sword trembled slightly, humming, instantly transforming into a sword light, shooting towards it.</p><p>Heaven and earth's energy surged again. A spirit sword flew, accompanied by a powerful spiritual tide, swallowing everything in its path.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The sword's hum was like thunder.</p><p>A mass of blood, which was almost regaining human form, was directly in front of the sword.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The sword's shadow passed right through.  The blood offered no resistance, instantly solidifying.  A faint, shrill scream seemed to echo, but no wound was visible on the blood.</p><p>The spiritual tide surged forward.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The blood shattered, its fragments swept away and utterly vanished by the tide.</p><p>A powerful enemy who had once driven Qin Sang to the brink was slain with a single strike!</p><p>The Yunyou Sword, after killing the figure, moved without pause towards the pool of blood.</p><p>Above the blood pool, the Yunyou Sword transformed again into a colossal sword, its blade pointing downwards, ready to strike.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's seven sword spirits appeared around the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>Instantly, the immense spiritual tide was calmed as if by a gentle hand.  The giant sword, a manifestation of the Yunyou Sword, dissipated, revealing the sword's true form.</p><p>Then, the Yunyou Sword itself began to fade, vanishing into thin air along with the seven sword spirits.</p><p>Silence fell around the blood pool. Everything seemed as if it had never happened, like a still lake, undisturbed.</p><p>In the blood pool, two figures struggling to break free were suddenly struck with horror.</p><p>Earlier, witnessing Qin Sang's breakthrough and his sword cleaving through heavenly thunder, their expressions hadn't changed much; they showed no sign of retreat.</p><p>Now, witnessing this bizarre scene, their expressions changed drastically, revealing unprecedented shock.</p><p>"Sword Domain!"</p><p>A cultivator at the Unity Stage can create their own Dharma Domain, a great power.  Different schools and cultivation methods produce different manifestations of Dharma Domains.  In the vast world, people often give them different names based on their outward appearance.  For instance, a sword cultivator's Dharma Domain is called a Sword Domain.</p><p>How could they not be shocked? A cultivator who had just entered the Void Refinement stage was wielding swordsmanship with the aura of a Sword Domain!</p><p>Qin Sang, of course, couldn't have comprehended a Sword Domain himself.</p><p>Upon reaching the Void Refinement stage, his Seven Spirits Killing Array underwent another transformation, capable of transforming the array into a domain!</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation was still shallow, and he didn't know if the Seven Spirits Killing Array could evolve into a true Sword Domain at the Void Refinement stage. What he had just unleashed was merely a glimpse of its potential.</p><p>Furthermore, the sword light imparted by Elder Tianyue was profound in its meaning and had guided Qin Sang towards this level, allowing him to unleash that strike immediately after his breakthrough!</p><p>Even a trace of Sword Domain aura transcended the realm of a mere sword array.</p><p>The two in the blood pool were terrified.</p><p>At their peak, they hadn't taken Qin Sang seriously. But now, things were different. They had forcefully invaded the Divine Court and suffered grievous injuries.</p><p>Moreover, trapped between the barriers of the Divine Court, they were severely restricted and suppressed.</p><p>Qin Sang saw this as well.</p><p>As he struck, the phoenix wings on his back unfurled.  His Qingluan Dharma Image, accompanied by a resounding phoenix cry, separated from his body and soared into the air.</p><p>At the same time, winds and clouds converged above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>His surging true essence left his body, forming a phantom in mid-air, identical to him in appearance and aura.</p><p>A Void Refinement Dharma Body!</p><p>Both the Dharma Image and Dharma Body appeared simultaneously, rising into the sky.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Suddenly, a dazzling golden light erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang held nothing back, unleashing the Sun Wheel Seal with his Dharma Image and Dharma Body, its power far exceeding anything he had shown before.</p><p>A golden sun hung in the air.  Golden ripples in the void seemed tangible.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Qin Sang roared, the Sun Wheel's light shining directly onto the blood pool.</p><p>In an instant, the blood pool was enveloped in golden light. The light penetrated the mud and blood, causing even more intense turmoil.</p><p>Qin Sang's aim wasn't to kill them. The full power of the Sun Wheel Seal was poured into the blood pool. He couldn't shake the palm print or the Divine Court, but by giving his all, he could amplify the chaos within the pool!</p><p>The two knew it was too late.</p><p>The already terrifying pressure, even a slight increase, was more than they could bear.</p><p>The blood pool was like a cage, binding them tightly, making every movement feel incredibly heavy.</p><p>"Aaah!"</p><p>They let out anguished screams.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored them.  They had shown him no mercy, and he would show none in return!</p><p>"Die!"</p><p>Above the blood pool, a ripple appeared in the calm void, a light and ethereal sword shadow emerging, silently slicing towards the blood pool.</p><p>Soundlessly.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The golden light dissipated.</p><p>The blood pool returned to normal, the mud and blood still churning, but the two figures were gone.</p><p>…</p><p>"Huff… huff…"</p><p>Qin Sang breathed heavily, his eyes fixed on the blood pool.</p><p>"Dead?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart relaxed. He was completely exhausted; if those two hadn't died, he would have!</p><p>But just as Qin Sang thought he was safe, a woman's voice rang out from behind him.</p><p>"Not bad! Very good!"</p><p>Qin Sang froze, slowly turning around to see a woman clad in blood-soaked robes, her body somewhat translucent, standing behind him.</p><p>The woman looked at the Yunyou Sword with a hint of remembrance, her tone revealing her admiration for Qin Sang. "I heard from Tianyue about your temperament. It's quite different from what I expected. But, you withstood the Thunder Ancestor's attack and used it to break through, showing that your will and spirit are no less than his in his prime. It's no wonder you could inherit his mantle."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't recognize the woman, yet he felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>When he realized the source of that familiarity, he was incredulous.</p><p>“…That blood moon?”</p><p></p>
