<h1>Chapter 571: The Reward</h1><p>Never presume to know the mind of another, especially when that other is a Nascent Soul cultivator.  With this thought in mind, Qin Sang followed Lord Dongyang, passing unimpeded through the throng of demons and arriving before the stone hall.</p><p>Once the vulture-like demons noticed the intruders, the entire mountain's demonic inhabitants were alerted. They swarmed forward, turning the sky a dense black.</p><p>Lord Dongyang slaughtered the demons in pairs and in droves.</p><p>Carcasses littered the ground, black blood stained the stone mountain, and a foul stench filled the air.</p><p>Finally, the demons were terrified. They circled overhead, shrieking, but dared not descend.</p><p>Other cultivators ascending the mountain benefited from the distraction, quickly making their way to the stone hall unharmed while the demons' attention was focused elsewhere.</p><p>Once Qin Sang and his companions entered the stone hall, the demons finally gave up their clamor and returned to their perches.  Looking back, Qin Sang was surprised to see the mountain still covered with a dense mass of demons, their numbers seemingly undiminished.</p><p>A passage led onward, connecting a series of stone halls.</p><p>The hall was empty.</p><p>At the far end, a faint light flickered, suggesting a doorway.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.  He'd clearly seen several people enter the hall ahead of them, but now the hall was empty.  They must have all passed through that door.</p><p>Beyond the door seemed to lie another vast space. The true extent of the Violet Firmament Palace was truly unfathomable.  The sprawling complex of a thousand palaces at the foot of the mountain was already magnificent enough.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly anticipated the wonders the Violet Firmament Palace held.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Dongyang, your swordsmanship is divine. This old man has benefited from your prowess.”</p><p>Laughter suddenly echoed through the hall.</p><p>Startled, Qin Sang scanned the area and noticed a figure, a wizened old man in hempen robes, materializing near the hall's entrance.</p><p>Qin Sang instantly recognized him as a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Celestial Union. Not only had he survived the great battle, but he was also among the least injured of the Celestial Union survivors, a testament to his strength.</p><p>Lord Dongyang showed no surprise, replying with a smile, “Those mere Corpse Vultures possess only a touch of corpse poison. Fellow Daoist Dongyun could surely handle them with ease.  I dare not take credit.”</p><p>“These Corpse Vultures originate from the Immortal Graves.  Their corpse poison is quite peculiar. While your swordsmanship is perfectly suited to dispelling it, this old man would have to expend considerable effort.”  The old man shook his head, slowly approaching them.</p><p>His sallow face was wrinkled, his eyes dull and clouded, his demeanor listless. He looked like a truly decrepit old man.  Whether this was his natural state or the result of exhaustion from the great battle was unclear.</p><p>The old man's lifeless eyes shifted to Chen Yan, and he said meaningfully, “This must be Fellow Daoist Chen Yan. This old man styles himself Dongyun Xian. I'd never heard that Mount Shaohua harbored such a prodigious talent as Fellow Daoist Chen Yan, reaching Nascent Soul so quietly, unbeknownst to the world. You two have hidden yourselves well.  Were you planning to surprise us at the Heavenly Mountain?”</p><p>“Chen Yan greets Fellow Daoist Dongyun.”  Chen Yan bowed slightly, offering no further response.</p><p>Lord Dongyang chuckled.  “Why has Fellow Daoist Dongyun come alone? Has Patriarch Zhen been affected by recent events and decided to forgo the Heavenly Mountain? Victory and defeat are commonplace in war. The Abyssal Devil's schemes cannot last. As long as the cultivators of our two domains unite and stand together, we will surely prevail!”</p><p>Dongyun Xian nodded. “Well said, Fellow Daoist! Though grieved, we will not be defeated.  We must avenge our fallen comrades! Several fellow Daoists who have lost their physical bodies require Patriarch Zhen's assistance.  This old man has come ahead. Once Patriarch Zhen is finished, I trust he won't miss the treasure hunt at the Heavenly Mountain…”</p><p>Dongyun Xian continued towards the depths of the hall. After a few steps, he seemed to remember something and turned back, his gaze sweeping over Qin Sang and the others.  He asked softly, “Which of you is young friend Qin Sang?”</p><p>All eyes turned to Qin Sang, their expressions varied.</p><p>Autumn Dusk White and the other three were particularly surprised.</p><p>Qin Sang was bewildered. He had never met Dongyun Xian before and couldn't understand why the man was seeking him out, or how he even knew his name.</p><p>However, the man's tone seemed amicable, suggesting no ill intent.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at his master for guidance. Seeing Lord Dongyang nod, he stepped forward and bowed.  “Junior Qin Sang greets Senior.”</p><p>Dongyun Xian looked Qin Sang up and down, nodding. “Indeed!”</p><p>With that, he turned and departed, leaving a confused Qin Sang behind.</p><p>“Don't be surprised! We were able to anticipate the Wuji Sect Master's movements and prepare ourselves thanks to Patriarch Chongyi's warning. Patriarch Chongyi, in turn, learned of this from a disciple of their sect called Wandering Cloud. Just now, the Nascent Soul cultivators met and asked Wandering Cloud of the Grand Elixir Sect to explain the situation. Wandering Cloud volunteered that you were the one who made the initial discovery. He recounted the details of your encounter with the Wuji Sect Master and Huang Tian in the Boundless Valley, and how you discovered the signs of their collusion.” Lord Dongyang explained.</p><p>“This time, although your actions were unintentional, you played a crucial role in foiling the Abyssal Devil's plot and saving our two domains.  The Nascent Soul cultivators will acknowledge your contribution.</p><p>“For now, the Violet Firmament Palace takes precedence. We haven't had time to discuss your reward, but rest assured, you will be compensated upon our return.</p><p>“I heard from Feng Ming that you have yet to form your Gold Core despite consuming the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower.</p><p>“There's no need to worry now. With so many Nascent Soul cultivators, we can surely find a way to forcibly elevate your cultivation.  Procuring a suitable natal magic treasure for you is also a matter of course.</p><p>“However, even with such a generous reward, you must remain humble and diligent. Do not assume that these external possessions guarantee your safety.  Understood?”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly suppressed his excitement and bowed respectfully.  “Disciple understands and will heed Master's teachings.”</p><p>Lord Dongyang grunted in acknowledgement.  “Let's go.”</p><p>Lord Dongyang and Chen Yan led the way.</p><p>Qin Sang followed, his mind filled with visions of the future.</p><p>He had expected to spend considerable effort acquiring a natal magic treasure, but now one awaited him.</p><p>Such a reward for an unintentional act – he owed it all to Wandering Cloud for remembering him!</p><p>“Congratulations, Junior Brother Qin!”</p><p>Even Autumn Dusk White envied Qin Sang's fortune.</p><p>However, he envied not Qin Sang's guaranteed Gold Core formation, but the effortless acquisition of a natal magic treasure.  His master had instructed him to gather the materials for his own natal magic treasure as part of his cultivation journey.</p><p>As for Mu Yifeng and the others, they envied Qin Sang's access to the assistance of Nascent Soul cultivators, which guaranteed his advancement towards the Great Dao.</p><p>Little did they know, Qin Sang no longer needed such assistance.</p><p>Nevertheless, Qin Sang was overjoyed.  He didn't need help forming his Gold Core, but he could request that the reward be exchanged for something else. With so many Nascent Soul Patriarchs, healing his hidden injuries would surely be a simple matter.</p>
