<h1>Chapter 1955: Royal Advisor</h1><p>Qin Sang flew slowly above the Fire Domain.</p><p>The Fire Domain was vast and sparsely populated, but Qin Sang could occasionally sense cultivators, shuttling back and forth within the magma, searching for something.</p><p>He even discovered two Nascent Soul cultivators wandering near his Daoist Abode.</p><p>The abode was sealed by a spirit array, so they naturally couldn't sense it.</p><p>Entering the abode, Qin Sang immediately summoned Gui Hou.</p><p>When Gui Hou arrived, Qin Sang handed him a mustard seed pouch.</p><p>"Deliver these items to Qingyang Temple, retrieve the Earthwalker, and make a trip to Twilightfall Mountain…"</p><p>Yun Dutian was preparing for a great war, and Twilightfall Mountain certainly wouldn't lag behind. Qin Sang intended to seize this opportunity to play both sides.</p><p>Among his Nascent Soul experts, Ling Shi had a feud with the Valley of Fallen Souls, while Gui Hou possessed superior strength and intellect.  With the Earthwalker to protect him, he would be safe.</p><p>"When you have no other duties, you will remain at Qingyang Temple at their disposal."</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Gui Hou bowed and retreated. He first sought out Ling Shi to inquire about the situation at Twilightfall Mountain, then left the Daoist Abode and headed south.</p><p>Qin Sang went directly to the fire chamber.  With a wave of his hand, he was surrounded by spheres of light, each containing various magical treasures and spirit materials.</p><p>……</p><p>After Gui Hou arrived at Qingyang Temple, he was also summoned to the underground chamber.</p><p>Three Nascent Soul experts waited before the main altar for instructions.</p><p>The mustard seed pouch sent by his master contained some of the spirit materials needed to construct the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang had recorded the altar construction method in a jade slip and given it to the three demons.</p><p>He would preside over the main altar, but the construction of branch altars didn't require his personal attention; the three demons could handle it.</p><p>Gui Hou took the jade slip and the Earthwalker and hurried to Twilightfall Mountain without stopping.</p><p>Luo Hou and Taiyi, at Qingyang Temple, thoroughly comprehended the contents of the jade slip, then also took spirit materials and set off.</p><p>The restoration of the altar array begins today!</p><p>……</p><p>Neither the young man surnamed Shi nor the Yin family revealed their encounter at Qingyang Temple to the outside world.</p><p>Xiao Wu and Yu Lang lived a peaceful life day after day at Qingyang Temple. Their most frequent interactions were with the villagers of Seven Rows Village, the students of the school, and those seeking medicine.</p><p>Here, the tumultuous changes of the cultivation world were imperceptible.</p><p>The weather turned cool.</p><p>Yellow leaves danced in the wind.</p><p>‘Clatter, clatter, clatter…’</p><p>Several swift horses approached Seven Rows Village along the main road.</p><p>The leader, dressed in fine brocade robes, was full of youthful vigor, with refined features and an air of elegance – a truly handsome young nobleman.</p><p>The others following him wore sturdy attire and carried swords, appearing to be his attendants and guards.</p><p>Their temples bulged prominently, their riding postures and formation unusual. Their hawk-like eyes darted around, vigilant against potential enemies from any direction.</p><p>Seeing Seven Rows Village and the flourishing bamboo grove from afar, the young nobleman smiled and flicked the reins.</p><p>"Giddy up!"</p><p>His speed abruptly increased, and his attendants effortlessly kept pace, riding as if on flat ground, their horsemanship exceptionally skilled.</p><p>Rounding a corner, the young nobleman let out a soft exclamation.</p><p>He saw a large stone erected at the entrance to the bamboo grove, engraved with characters like 'Those seeking medicine, enter here,' and a villager-like man standing guard beside it.</p><p>‘Whoa!’</p><p>The young nobleman reined in his horse and glanced towards the back mountain of Seven Rows Village, asking in a deep voice, "My good sir, that bamboo grove should be the school, shouldn't it?  Why would one seek medicine there? Is Daoist Qingfeng of Qingyang Temple no longer present?"</p><p>Seeing the demeanor of the newcomers, the villager hurriedly stood up and said with a forced smile, "This young master must be from out of town.  The school's teacher is Daoist Yu Lang of Qingyang Temple, Daoist Qingfeng's disciple.  Daoist Qingfeng is getting on in years and has passed the temple on to Daoist Yu Lang.  Daoist Yu Lang teaches at the school during the day and returns to the temple to sleep at night."</p><p>"Yu Lang is the temple master now?"</p><p>A faint smile appeared on the young nobleman's lips. He dismounted and instructed his attendants to wait outside.</p><p>Several bamboo huts specifically for medical consultations had been built outside the school.</p><p>The villager asked the young nobleman to wait inside and went to inform Yu Lang.</p><p>The young nobleman sat patiently, but with a hint of uncontainable excitement in his expression, taking out a jade pendant and toying with it in his hand.</p><p>Soon, footsteps could be heard from outside.</p><p>A young Daoist priest in a blue Daoist robe walked in. It was Yu Lang.</p><p>Seeing the young nobleman gazing at him with a smile, Yu Lang was momentarily stunned, his face full of surprise: "You are…  Nao Teng?"</p><p>It was his childhood friend, Tao Teng, whom he hadn't seen for many years!</p><p>Traces of his old features could still be discerned.</p><p>At first glance, Yu Lang almost didn't recognize him, as the other's temperament had changed drastically.</p><p>In their youth, Tao Teng's family had been well-off, but he was just a wealthy young master.</p><p>Now, Tao Teng exuded an air of nobility, along with a dignified composure that came with being in a high position for a long time, an aura even the magistrate of Jindian County lacked!</p><p>Tao Teng's family had moved to the capital, and initially, a few letters had been exchanged, but due to the long distance, communication had gradually ceased.</p><p>Yu Lang remembered that the Tao family were merchants, continuing their business in the capital.</p><p>But this kind of temperament could probably only be cultivated by prominent noble families!</p><p>Tao Teng's smile stiffened slightly, and he said angrily, "You almost didn't recognize me, but you remember my nickname perfectly!"</p><p>That fleeting expression allowed Yu Lang to recapture the feeling of their past.</p><p>"It really is you!"</p><p>Yu Lang deliberately circled Tao Teng, clicking his tongue in amazement, "The Tao family has prospered in the capital?"</p><p>"Your transformation is no less significant. This ethereal, otherworldly temperament, I've only seen it in Master."</p><p>Tao Teng's expression was complex, and he suddenly sighed, "You truly are a cultivator!"</p><p>"You!"</p><p>Yu Lang was truly stunned.</p><p>Seven Rows Village was remote, and no cultivators would come specifically to investigate. He had never deliberately concealed his cultivation.</p><p>Even so, mortals shouldn't be able to see through him.</p><p>But Yu Lang scrutinized Tao Teng, who clearly didn't have the slightest fluctuation of spiritual energy.</p><p>"Am I the only one allowed to have immortal fate?"</p><p>Tao Teng revealed a smug smile, "You little bull-nose, you've kept me in the dark for so long!  Today, I finally have my revenge!"</p><p>He gently rubbed the jade pendant in his hand, and the pendant flashed, his aura instantly changing, revealing him to be a cultivator!</p><p>Yu Lang was immediately astonished, "Tenth level of Qi Refining!"</p><p>When they parted ways, Tao Teng had clearly been a mortal.</p><p>"You've already established your foundation, haven't you? I'm still no match for you, I guess!"</p><p>Tao Teng looked dejected for a moment, but quickly regained his smug expression. "So, shocked, right?"</p><p>Yu Lang honestly nodded, "I really didn't expect this. Did you take a master in the capital?"</p><p>"That's a long story…"</p><p>Tao Teng cast a spell to isolate them from the outside world and sat down face to face with Yu Lang.</p><p>"Do you remember that time at the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant?  Back then, I had a feeling that the storyteller and your master were definitely not ordinary people. After returning to the capital, I always regretted leaving early that day. Later, during an outing, I accidentally strayed into the deep mountains and stumbled upon my master. He led me into the Immortal Sect, and only then did I learn that there was such a thing as the Immortal Path…"</p><p>Tao Teng lowered his voice and asked curiously, "Are Daoist Qingfeng and the storyteller reclusive experts?"</p><p>"After the meal that day, Senior Qingyuan left and never returned.  As for Master, I've never seen him make a move, so he might be very powerful…"</p><p>Yu Lang couldn't help but recall the respectful attitude of the Jindian County ghosts and gods, the young man surnamed Shi, and the entire Yin family towards his master.</p><p>It was said that the head of the Yin family was a Nascent Soul ancestor.</p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p>Tao Teng sighed, "That day, my servants were bothersome and insisted on taking me away. I missed hearing the two experts discuss the Dao, missing out on immortal fate!"</p><p>Even now, Tao Teng still deeply regretted it, slapping his thigh hard.</p><p>"I barely understood anything Master and Senior Qingyuan talked about, and I'm still confused. If you want to know, I can tell you later," Yu Lang said.</p><p>"Truly a good brother, worthy of my constant thoughts of you!"</p><p>Tao Teng was overjoyed, gripping Yu Lang's hand, "After becoming a disciple, Master kept me in the deep mountains to cultivate, rarely allowing me to leave. I had no chance to send you a letter. It wasn't until last year that Master allowed me to descend the mountain. Although I didn't come to see you, your great name has long been known to me. After arranging my affairs, I immediately came to Jindian County to find you!"</p><p>"What sect did you join?"</p><p>Yu Lang hesitated.</p><p>There was another question he hadn't asked.</p><p>Tao Teng, with his air of nobility, looked every bit like a young master who had enjoyed all the luxuries of the mortal world, not like a cultivator.</p><p>Could this be the custom of the cultivation world in the capital?</p><p>"I don't know what sect it is. Master won't tell me, saying that my abilities are too meager and mentioning it would disgrace the sect!"</p><p>Tao Teng scratched his head, noticing Yu Lang's gaze, and chuckled. He stood up, smoothing his brocade robe and accessories, boasting, "How do I look?  The finest Huzhou silk in the Yan Kingdom, the finest Xishan jade, all tribute offered to the royal family!"</p><p>Without waiting for Yu Lang's reply, Tao Teng pointed at the school and added, "I'm different from you. You are playing in the mortal world, while I have truly descended, experiencing the mortal life!"</p><p>"Experiencing the mortal life…"</p><p>Yu Lang was even more puzzled.</p><p>He now knew that immortals and mortals were different, not just in terms of strength.</p><p>Cultivators distanced themselves from the mortal world, firstly because there was divine oversight in the mortal realm, and secondly because the mortal world had too many temptations, easily clouding one's Dao Heart and neglecting cultivation.</p><p>Could it be that Tao Teng cultivated some special technique, or that he didn't value cultivation?</p><p>"Indeed! After descending the mountain last year, I sought an audience with the Crown Prince and became his advisor, assisting him in inheriting the throne. Those people outside are all guards sent by the Crown Prince to protect me!"</p><p>Tao Teng said in a serious tone.</p><p>He seemed unaware that if these words were to spread, they would surely cause an uproar in the Yan Kingdom!</p><p>Yu Lang, teaching at the school, had some understanding of the political situation in the Yan court.</p><p>The current emperor was advanced in years, and undercurrents surged within the court.</p><p>The Crown Prince was the eldest son, the emperor's legitimate heir, but the Empress had passed away long ago, and he lived a secluded life in the Eastern Palace, rumored to be of a gentle nature.</p><p>Among the princes, the most popular was the Second Prince, wise and valiant, skilled in both literary and martial arts, deeply favored by the emperor.</p><p>Other princes also participated in government affairs, many with reputations for virtue.</p><p>Tao Teng, clearly a cultivator, was not only meddling in court politics but also intended to assist the Crown Prince in ascending the throne!</p><p>How could the ghosts and gods of the Yan Kingdom's capital allow him to do such a thing?</p><p>"My master has a connection with the City God of the Yan capital. I swore an oath before the City God that regardless of success or failure, I would never use even a sliver of my power to interfere in any mortal affairs. And at the appropriate time, I would feign death and detach myself, living a true mortal life."</p><p>Tao Teng opened his palm, showing the jade pendant to Yu Lang.  "This City God Jade was bestowed upon me by the City God. It can conceal my aura and seal my cultivation. If I attempt to use spiritual energy, the City God will immediately detect it, and I will face divine punishment. The law is unforgiving!"</p><p>Yu Lang suddenly understood why he couldn't see through Tao Teng's cultivation. However, he still didn't understand, "Why would you do this?"</p><p>"Do you remember what I said at the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant?</p><p>"That day, the storyteller asked me what the Great Dao of humanity was.</p><p>"I replied, 'Love between father and son, loyalty between ruler and subject, distinction between husband and wife, order between elder and younger, and trust between friends.'</p><p>"I also replied, 'When the Great Dao prevails, the world is shared by all.  The virtuous and able are chosen, trustworthiness and harmony are cultivated. Thus, people do not regard only their own parents as parents, nor do they treat only their own children as children.  The elderly are provided for, the able-bodied are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, disabled, and sick are all cared for.'  But…"</p><p>Tao Teng stood up, gazing outside the bamboo hut, "The storyteller didn't seem to agree. After he left, I pondered deeply, but no matter how I thought about it, I couldn't imagine a more ideal human world than this. So I studied diligently, vowing to pass the imperial examinations, enter the court, and become an official. One day, I want to personally create such a prosperous age, to prove that I am right!"</p><p>Looking at his childhood friend, Yu Lang's expression gradually became serious, and he guessed his friend's thoughts.</p><p>"You chose the Crown Prince," Yu Lang said thoughtfully.</p><p>Tao Teng nodded: "Indeed. The Crown Prince is the rightful heir, benevolent by nature, accomplished in both literary and martial arts, and sufficiently patient. A dragon can be large or small, large enough to summon clouds and mist, small enough to hide and conceal itself! I've also met with several other princes in secret.  The Second Prince has the strongest momentum, seemingly wise and valiant, but he's autocratic and fond of scheming, not appearing like a true ruler…"</p><p>Listening to Tao Teng's assessment of the princes, Yu Lang couldn't help but sigh, "I never thought you would willingly become a subject, subservient to mortals."</p><p>The moment he uttered these words, Yu Lang was startled.</p><p>These words had slipped out so naturally, so casually.</p><p>Back then, the death of his teacher at the hands of a cultivator's spirit beast had filled him with grief and despair.</p><p>At the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant, he had questioned: Are mortals destined to be mere pawns?</p><p>Only a few years had passed, and had he already been subtly changed, believing that cultivators should be superior to mortals?</p><p>No wonder Master said that the most difficult part of cultivation was staying true to one's original heart!</p><p>Yu Lang was nearly drenched in a cold sweat from the shock.</p><p>"A true king should have the world in his heart, regardless of cultivation level!"</p><p>Tao Teng didn't notice his friend's strange behavior and said dismissively, "Mortals cannot cultivate, but they can practice martial arts. As the saying goes, 'Learn literary and martial arts, offer them to the emperor's house.'  Among mortals, there are still先天高手 (pre-heaven realm experts) serving as generals and commanders in the army. Their martial prowess far surpasses that of the emperor, yet they willingly serve as advisors and ministers. As long as he is a wise ruler, why can't I?"</p>
