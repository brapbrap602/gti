<h1>Chapter 751: The Stone Chamber</h1><p>Having escaped the Purple Star Griffins, everyone felt a sense of relief.  Their powers were hampered by the toxic fog in this desolate place, making it difficult to deal with such a large flock.</p><p>"Did you notice? The insects and beasts we've encountered since entering seem normal enough, but once a fight starts, they go completely mad, becoming incredibly ferocious and losing all reason,"</p><p>The young man with the sword, gazing at where the griffons had disappeared, spoke.</p><p>"That's right. That's why they're called ferocious insects and beasts.  Not just here, but throughout the Seven Kills Hall, all the creatures are like this.  It's unknown what influences them. Even Nascent Soul masters can't unravel the secrets of the Seven Kills Hall. So, everyone, remember to leave the Seven Kills Hall before the spirit array breaks."</p><p>Xiang Yi looked down at the ground, walking around, searching for something.</p><p>The inside of the canyon seemed like a different world from the outside.  There wasn't a single plant in sight; it was utterly barren, covered in hard, jagged rocks, sharp as knives. Everyone moved with extreme caution.</p><p>Xiang Yi finally determined their direction.  The canyon's terrain was strange. As they walked forward, the ground sloped downwards, making it feel like they were descending from a mountaintop.</p><p>Obscured by the toxic fog, they couldn't clearly see the surrounding terrain and could only guess.</p><p>The descent was deeper than they imagined, seemingly bottomless.  Ferocious beasts still roamed here, and Xiang Yi avoided them whenever possible.</p><p>The toxic fog grew denser.  Everyone periodically checked the Bone Lotus, ensuring it showed no abnormalities.  Only three petals were tinged purple, indicating ample time remained.</p><p>Finally, the descent stopped. They had no idea how far down they had gone.</p><p>The toxic fog enveloped the Bone Lotus's protective barrier, like a purple curtain, leaving them relying almost entirely on their hearing to sense danger.</p><p>Fortunately, they didn't encounter any beasts skilled at ambush.</p><p>After traveling a short distance, Xiang Yi signaled the group to stop, then looked to the left, releasing a burst of true energy.</p><p>The toxic fog was momentarily dispersed, quickly closing again, but everyone clearly saw the shadow of an ancient stone chamber within.</p><p>"Daoist Xiang, is this the stone chamber...?"</p><p>Seeing Xiang Yi nod, everyone rejoiced. They had finally reached their destination.</p><p>However, no one dared to relax.  That fleeting glimpse revealed the chamber was unusual, surrounded by ancient restrictions, hidden in the heart of the toxic fog wasteland – likely a dangerous place.  The fact that the Merchant Guild sent so many people here spoke volumes.</p><p>"Don't approach yet. Let's circle the chamber. If there are any beasts nearby, hunt them down to avoid being detected while we break the restrictions and causing trouble."</p><p>Xiang Yi whispered.</p><p>"Are there even stronger beasts inside?" Qin Sang curiously asked.</p><p>Xiang Yi nodded.  "This seems to be the bottom layer of the toxic fog wasteland. According to Merchant Guild records, there's a bottomless chasm ahead – the true heart of the wasteland and the source of the toxic fog. Entering the chasm, the Bone Lotus would likely be completely corrupted and lose its power.  The fog there is feared even by Nascent Soul masters. Also, at the bottom of the chasm, there may be beasts comparable to transformed great demons."</p><p>Everyone was amazed.  Truly a desolate place!</p><p>Without the Bone Lotus, they would have exhausted their true energy in the toxic fog in a short time. And this wasn't even the core of the wasteland.</p><p>They began circling the stone chamber, searching for beasts.</p><p>They actually found two lion-like beasts and killed them.  After clearing the area, everyone approached the stone chamber.</p><p>Upon reaching it, everyone wore strange expressions.</p><p>It couldn't really be called a chamber; it was tiny, only about half the size of a room, perfectly square. Apart from the ancient restrictions, it had no notable features.</p><p>"Did the Merchant Guild want us to break the restrictions and take something from inside?"</p><p>The Liu couple stepped forward, activating their true energy to lightly touch the restrictions. "These restrictions don't seem very strong.  Even Nascent Soul masters wouldn't find them difficult to break. This thing is so obvious, it must have been visited countless times by Nascent Soul masters. What could possibly be left?"</p><p>Xiang Yi calmly said, "That's all I know. The Merchant Guild's request is indeed for everyone to cooperate with me to break the restrictions and retrieve something. Many secret places in the Seven Kills Hall are like this.  High cultivation isn't enough to do whatever you want.  Just because Nascent Soul masters have been here doesn't mean all the treasures are gone."</p><p>Xiang Yi produced eight small triangular flags, distributing one to each person.</p><p>The eight apricot-yellow triangular flags were identical, their poles shorter than a handspan.</p><p>Qin Sang took hers, immediately recognizing them as a type of forbidden artifact.  The eight of them, controlling these flags, should be able to break the ancient restriction.</p><p>"These are Earth Origin Flags.  My cultivation is in Earth-based techniques, so I will be the focal point of the array. Fellow cultivators, assist me, and pay close attention to the formation..."</p><p>Xiang Yi carefully explained the key points of the array.</p><p>All present were highly cultivated individuals, and they quickly grasped the formation. In front of the ancient hall, they formed the array with Xiang Yi at its center.</p><p>Xiang Yi held the bone lotus in one hand and a triangular flag in the other.</p><p>After the others took their positions, Xiang Yi nodded slightly and then poured his true energy into the triangular flag.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>The triangular flag swelled to a height of ten feet, planting itself firmly in the ground.</p><p>Xiang Yi rapidly changed hand seals, launching a series of incantations that poured into the flag. The flag rustled, swallowing true energy like a bottomless pit.</p><p>As true energy flowed into it, cloud script and thunder patterns appeared on the flag, mysterious and unusual.</p><p>Apricot-yellow light erupted, and the ground began to tremble.</p><p>"Form the array!"</p><p>Xiang Yi roared.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others immediately sat cross-legged, activating the triangular flags.</p><p>A difference became apparent: their flags were a third shorter than Xiang Yi's, and the cloud script and thunder patterns were less dense.</p><p>However, the yellow light emitted by their flags was not inferior to the central flag, and after appearing, they seemed to be drawn towards the central point, converging on it.</p><p>The central flag became even more radiant.</p><p>The earth shook violently.</p><p>If they hadn't cleared the area beforehand, surrounding beasts would certainly have been attracted.</p><p>A constant flow of Earth Origin energy was drawn from the earth's veins, merging into the flag array. A sphere of light appeared on the central flag, gathering terrifying power.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and the others' true energy was rapidly depleting, and they couldn't move freely; they had to maintain the array.</p><p>Qin Sang had taken several pills beforehand, so she was holding up well.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Xiang Yi's eyes widened, and he let out a furious roar.</p><p>*Hong!*</p><p>A dazzling beam of yellow light shot out, striking the ancient restriction.</p><p>For a moment, the yellow light enveloped the stone hall.  Only the collision of two immensely powerful forces, locked in a stalemate, could be felt.</p>
