<h1>Chapter 2147: The Tribulation of the Spiritual Treasure</h1><p>My life's spirit sword is acting up!</p><p>Could it be that the Yunyou Sword is about to transform?</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat caught off guard, but not overly surprised.</p><p>In the Talisman Realm, the Yunyou Sword was enlightened by Ziwei Tongzi, receiving a great benefit. It has been quietly nurturing within his primordial spirit ever since.</p><p>During that time, Qin Sang assisted Luohua Temple in refining a post-heaven spiritual treasure. He had the opportunity to observe this treasure as it neared its transformation.  The treasure ultimately failed to transform, but it attracted the aura of a heavenly tribulation.  Luohua Zhenren judged its failure to be due to insufficient foundation.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly compared the Yunyou Sword to Luohua Temple's treasure, feeling that the Yunyou Sword was no worse. He has been closely monitoring the changes in the Five Elements Crown and the Yunyou Sword.  Even if he elevates them both to the peak of spiritual treasures, their successful transformation is not guaranteed. This step involves too many profound mysteries, akin to the work of creation.  It's not uncommon for such transformations to be stalled for thousands of years, or even indefinitely.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown has prematurely nurtured a spirit, and Qin Sang had expected it to advance first. Unexpectedly, the Yunyou Sword took this step first, likely due to the significant benefits it received from Ziwei Tongzi.</p><p>Spiritual treasures undergoing transformation into post-heaven spiritual treasures also face tribulation.  He cannot undergo this tribulation in front of the Shao Shi.</p><p>Especially the Yunyou Sword, even more caution is needed.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword trembled within his primordial spirit, Qin Sang sensed a sense of urgency.  Fortunately, these are merely the signs of an imminent transformation, and the advancement won't begin immediately. He still has time to prepare.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed the turmoil in his heart, maintaining a calm expression. He said to the Shao Shi, "I understand the Si Huang's intentions. Since it's mutually beneficial, I have no reason to refuse. However, I must first see the  pearl before I make a decision."</p><p>The Shao Shi didn't notice the changes within Qin Sang, and joyfully replied, "Excellent! I shall return immediately and report this good news to the Si Huang. We will arrange a date to deliver the pearl for your inspection and verification.  At that time, I hope you will set up the altar and seal the thunder talisman within the pearl..."</p><p>"This cannot be rushed."</p><p>Qin Sang fabricated an excuse, "The thunder altar consumes enormous energy, activating it is no easy task, and I need to prepare in advance. Let's set a time; I'll make preparations, and Daoist Shi will bring the pearl. If all goes well, we will activate the altar immediately, how about that?"</p><p>He must prioritize the Yunyou Sword; other matters must be postponed.</p><p>Although the Shao Shi wanted the Mirage Tower as quickly as possible, he had no choice but to urge Qin Sang to hurry.</p><p>Receiving Qin Sang's clear response, the Shao Shi had no desire to stay long, and left that very night.</p><p>Shortly after the Shao Shi's departure, Qin Sang informed Su Nu, then left Qingyang Prefecture with Zhuque at breakneck speed. They arrived at the Zhuyan Tribe and prepared to depart for other tribes.</p><p>The elder's token given to him by the Zhuyan Tribe had not been reclaimed. Holding this token, he was a genuine elder, free to use the Zhuyan Tribe's teleportation array. The generosity of the Yuanxiang Clan Head was clearly intended to facilitate his travels to and from Purple Cloud Mountain.</p><p>Without encountering Clan Head Yuanxiang and Yuan Miao at the Zhuyan Tribe's territory, Qin Sang spared himself an explanation. He casually chose a tribe near the Nie River, teleported there, and then quietly flew towards the Nie River.</p><p>The Nie River is not only the edge of the Mist Sea but also the end of the East Sea.  Like the Abyss of the Storm World, it stretches across the easternmost point of the sea, boundless to the north and south.  No one knows how wide the Nie River is or what lies beyond it.</p><p>The Nie River is not a river in the common sense.  Legend says only a portion of it is visible to the world, and it's not only in the East Sea. The true Nie River is hidden in the unknown void.</p><p>Even in the East Sea, there are places unaffected by the Nie River, places free from danger, allowing easy passage to the other side.  However, nobody knows where they are.</p><p>Long ago, Qin Sang had envisioned the scene of the Yunyou Sword's tribulation.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword is related to the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, the legacy of the Ziwei Sword Venerable, coveted by all. The First Sword Attendant claimed that the Ziwei Sword Venerable was an unparalleled enemy to the world and urged him to avoid using his life's spirit sword as much as possible, even suggesting he seek protection from Lei Zu.</p><p>During transformation, heavenly tribulation will descend, and the spirit sword must emerge to face the tribulation's might. Thus, the transformation is the most likely time for exposure, making it crucial to distance himself from powerful cultivators.</p><p>However, powerful cultivators are elusive and unpredictable; avoiding them is not a simple task.</p><p>Discovering the Nie River in the Mist Sea, Qin Sang immediately realized it was the perfect location for the Yunyou Sword's tribulation.</p><p>In the Nie River, the clear and turbid qi are not yet separated. It is the most chaotic place in the world, perfect for masking the Yunyou Sword's aura fluctuations.  Even the First Sword Attendant couldn't withstand the Nie River's scouring; compared to other places, this offers the highest chance of avoiding powerful cultivators.</p><p>To avoid any unforeseen complications, it's best not to undergo a tribulation near a cultivation site.  Therefore, Qin Sang chose this secluded location.</p><p>Qin Sang has done all he can.  If calamity still befalls him, he can only accept his fate.  Undergoing tribulation in the River of Retribution presents many disadvantages, but Qin Sang will try to mitigate them.  Before reaching the deepest parts of the river, the Heavenly Dao is not so chaotic; a tribulation shouldn't unexpectedly transform.</p><p>While contemplating this, Qin Sang sensed his Yunyousword.</p><p>Within the spiritual sword, the spiritual embryo displayed unprecedented activity, emanating strange fluctuations. It felt as if a consciousness was about to awaken, emerging like a butterfly from its chrysalis!</p><p>Thankfully, with Lei Zu present, Qin Sang needn't conceal these fluctuations.</p><p>After sensing for a long time, Qin Sang felt the spiritual embryo's activity becoming increasingly intense. The more pronounced the fluctuations, the greater the chance of successful transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly delighted, anticipating what kind of sword spirit the Yunyousword would produce after its advancement, and if Yunyouzi would awaken.</p><p>Furthermore, obtaining a post-heaven spiritual treasure on the way to the sacred land provided another powerful defensive measure.</p><p>The sacred land is the cultivation site of powerful members of the Yi Ren clan. Using the Yunyousword there might attract attention. But in a life-or-death situation, such concerns would be secondary; survival would be paramount.</p><p>"We've arrived…"</p><p>Sensing the River of Retribution, Qin Sang landed, opened his eyes, and saw the familiar scene.</p><p>Qin Sang silently activated his talisman, without hesitation plunged into the river, speeding towards its depths. However, going too deep wasn't ideal; powerful beasts lurked within.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected the murky grey-white of the River of Retribution in the Mist Sea was due to the integration of mist.  As he ventured deeper, he found the murky qi became darker, confirming his hypothesis.</p><p>After searching for months, Qin Sang, possessing considerable patience, finally found a suitable location.  He thoroughly surveyed the area, ensuring no nearby beast nests, before feeling reassured.  Even Nascent Soul stage beasts couldn't perfectly conceal their presence, and their minds were already muddled, so they wouldn't deliberately hide.</p><p>The chosen place lacked land, shrouded in darkness, with raging waves – a terrifying scene.</p><p>He released Zhuque to patrol and provide support, and summoned the Tianmu butterfly and Min Zhuo to stand guard.  He himself hovered in mid-air, activating the Qianjun Ring, launching one array device after another to establish a formation.</p><p>'Rumble...Rumble...Rumble...'</p><p>A cold wave swept across the area.  Giant waves froze into ice shards, the ice spreading rapidly, quickly forming an ice platform beneath Qin Sang.</p><p>Reinforced by the spirit array, the platform steadily floated on the water, unaffected by the surrounding chaos.</p><p>Adding more protective barriers, Qin Sang landed on the ice, sat cross-legged, and a light flashed from his brow, releasing a beam of sword light.</p><p>The sword light was exceptionally pure, circling Qin Sang's head before the Yunyousword materialized. The sword was light as water, transparent and immaculate, inspiring reverence.</p><p>By this time, the Yunyousword had undergone significant transformation. Qin Sang could clearly sense the "spiritual embryo" pulsating with vigor, brimming with life, instilling confidence.</p><p>Perhaps this was the manifestation of a solid foundation!</p><p>Qin Sang had preemptively activated his talisman. With Lei Zu as its guardian, it could briefly protect the consciousness within the spiritual embryo and resist the river's influence. The Yunyousword had absorbed the Soul-Nurturing Wood and resided in his soul for years, thus absorbing the Jade Buddha's aura.</p><p>Lei Zu's unhidden aura also provided further protection for the Yunyousword.</p><p>Time passed slowly. The ice platform was enveloped by boundless chaotic storms, the sky and sea a boundless expanse, undisturbed.</p><p>After more than ten days, the spiritual embryo suddenly fell silent. Qin Sang sensed the consciousness was still there, remained calm, and waited patiently.  Fluctuations reappeared several days later.</p><p>He breathed a sigh of relief, continuing to observe the spiritual embryo. He found that after this period of silence, it had overcome a hurdle and was undergoing rapid transformation, with the consciousness within growing stronger.</p><p>The transformation proceeded faster than anticipated. On the seventh day, Qin Sang suddenly awoke and looked up at the sky.</p><p>'Boom...Boom...Boom...'</p><p>The heavens trembled.</p><p>Even in the darkness, clouds gathered in the sky, filled with the aura of Heavenly Might; tribulation was imminent!</p><p>A flicker of joy crossed Qin Sang's eyes, quickly replaced by solemnity as he watched the Yunyousword. This was his first experience witnessing a spiritual treasure undergoing tribulation.  He mostly followed the preparations made by Luo Hua Zhenren from years past to greet this Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>That day, the celestial might manifested.  Yunyou Sword shot into the sky, instantly erupting in a dazzling display of sword light. The trembling of the sword ceased, replaced by a powerful surge of energy.</p><p>This surge stemmed from the dramatic changes within the nascent spirit.  A sense of urgency permeated the air, mingled with the joy of new life and a fear of the celestial might.  Qin Sang sensed an increasingly complex array of emotions. This was a good sign, indicating the nascent consciousness was evolving towards true sentience, on the verge of achieving spiritual awareness!</p><p>HUM...</p><p>The spiritual sword began to tremble again, but this time it wasn't spontaneous. An external force was at play.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang sensed that consciousness finally breaking through its last barrier.  Though the sword spirit hadn't materialized, Qin Sang was certain: Yunyou Sword had birthed a sword spirit!</p><p>At the same time, he saw formless flames appearing in the void.</p><p>"The Tribulation of Netherfire! So spiritual treasures also face three calamities…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, gazing at the invisible flames surrounding him.</p><p>He had brought the tribulation formation he'd prepared for Zhuque, and finally, it had found its purpose.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>As the netherfire in the void intensified, Qin Sang sensed something else, his expression shifting subtly.</p><p>He vaguely perceived a targeted attack from the celestial might. It wasn't simply because he and Yunyou Sword were close; it felt as though they were treated as one entity.</p><p>"I can help the Sky-Eyed Butterfly through its tribulation, and Yunyou Sword is my life-bound spiritual sword.  It seems I can directly assist; perhaps the Sky-Eyed Butterfly can help too. This is the incomparable advantage of cultivating life and spirit together; it surpasses other spiritual treasures!"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts clarified, and he felt reassured. He immediately activated the tribulation formation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the netherfire multiplied, filling every corner of the space.</p><p>A boundless sea of fire engulfed them, flames dancing around Qin Sang.</p><p>The ferocity of the netherfire caused Qin Sang's face to change; he silently acknowledged the power of this heavenly tribulation!</p><p>He wasn't sure what determined the strength of a spiritual treasure's tribulation, but he knew the aura emanating from these netherfires far surpassed the heavenly tribulation he faced during his breakthrough to the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Confronted by the overwhelming netherfire, Qin Sang felt a pang of fear. His expression grew increasingly grave as he poured all his True Qi into Yunyou Sword, aiding its passage through the tribulation.</p><p>WHOOSH!</p><p>The netherfire surged towards Yunyou Sword with ferocious intensity.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Xuanbing continent erupted with beams of light, crimson and azure, converging in mid-air into a force that transformed into a multicolored halo, a luminous mist shrouding Yunyou Sword, shielding it from the netherfire.</p><p>This formation was created by Qin Sang, drawing upon his understanding of the tribulation formation of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect and his own tribulation experiences. It had some effect against the Void Refinement stage tribulation, but its effect was minimal now.</p><p>The power of the Netherfire Tribulation was too immense; the tribulation formation provided only negligible assistance.</p><p>Some netherfire was blocked and dissipated, but much more surged through the halo, burning the sword body.</p><p>Yunyou Sword had once absorbed three of the Ten Divine Trees:  the Soul-Nurturing Wood, the Nether Blood Mulberry, and the Diamond Fruit. It also incorporated the soul essence born from the Qingfu Zhengzhu. It was exceptionally rare, even in the Grand Thousand Worlds.</p><p>Regarding the Ten Divine Trees, a prevalent belief existed that due to their unique abilities, they once shone brilliantly in the Grand Thousand Worlds and became widely known in the cultivation world, hence their grouping. Although all were incredibly rare, their quality wasn't necessarily superior to other top-tier spiritual trees.</p><p>However, to be listed among the Ten Divine Trees meant their reputation was well-deserved. The Diamond Fruit was known as the supremely strong wood.  Yunyou Sword had absorbed two Diamond Fruits, making its blade's strength unmatched by most spiritual treasures.</p><p>Under the relentless burning of the endless netherfire, Yunyou Sword's body seemed to melt. Its internal structure was being relentlessly destroyed by the flames, while Qin Sang's True Qi flowed like a broken dam.</p><p>However, in Qin Sang's view, crisis also presented opportunity. Just as his body strengthened after each tribulation, Yunyou Sword's light became increasingly pure, as if refining away its "impurities".</p><p>Unable to reduce Yunyou Sword to ashes, the netherfire finally waned, and the fiery inferno began to dissipate.</p><p>The Wind Tribulation followed swiftly. This was the sword spirit's most vulnerable moment, the time for utmost caution.</p><p>After a brief moment, Qin Sang relaxed slightly. Perhaps thanks to Ziwei Tongzi's guidance, the sword spirit wasn't as frail as expected; it was greedily absorbing the benefits of the Wind Tribulation, rapidly growing stronger.</p><p>The second calamity had been overcome without major incident.</p><p>At that moment, dark clouds gathered in the sky, thunder rumbling. Lightning pierced the darkness, carrying the terrifying celestial might.</p><p>From a distance, the tribulation site would appear bathed in a golden radiance.</p><p>"It's a golden tribulation, just like the demon race's! It seems the spirit is also viewed as a demon by Heaven…"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, watching the golden lightning, and called out to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p>
