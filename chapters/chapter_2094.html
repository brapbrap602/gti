<h1>Chapter 2085: The Three Sects' Plot</h1><p>Central State.</p><p>What was once the Wuxiang Immortal Sect is now the headquarters of the Three Sects Alliance.  The eight scenic spots, Ganlu Zen Temple, and Tianhao Tower, the founders of the Three Sects Alliance, were already the leaders of the Daoist, Buddhist, and Demon sects, the overlords of Central State. After their alliance, other factions could only rely on their goodwill.</p><p>Years ago, after Qin Sang broke through to the Transformation God stage, he was the only cultivator at that level in the Storm World. He had the power to dismantle the Three Sects Alliance and suppress the three major sects. But at the time, the Qingyang Temple in Central State was newly established, and he himself had no interest in dominating the world.</p><p>More importantly, at that time there was no path to ascension.  He needed to unite various forces to find a way out for the Storm World. The Three Sects Alliance would not be an obstacle, but could better cooperate with him, consolidating forces.</p><p>After Qin Sang's disappearance, the Three Sects Alliance lost its counterbalance. When the Storm World first ascended, several high-level cultivators from the three major sects perished in heavenly tribulations, suffering varying degrees of losses.  But the various factions in Central State also suffered, so they were never able to shake the Three Sects Alliance's position.</p><p>When Liuli rose to prominence, discovering the Changyou tribe as a major enemy, the Storm World was in grave danger and had no energy to target the Three Sects Alliance; they even had to seek their support and could only tolerate them.</p><p>As time passed, the Three Sects Alliance gradually produced Transformation God cultivators, becoming increasingly powerful. The forces of Central State had to look to them for guidance; Liuli could no longer command them.</p><p>Yet Central State held the strongest human forces.</p><p>Perhaps because Liuli held the moral high ground, with unparalleled cultivation and prestige, or perhaps because the Three Sects Alliance believed the human situation hadn't improved, they pushed Liuli to the front to absorb the brunt of the conflict, preferring to remain in the shadows. So they haven't openly opposed Liuli.</p><p>Anyone with clear eyes could see that once the Three Sects Alliance produced one or even two late Transformation God cultivators, they would try to seize power.</p><p>Unfortunately, humans are currently slightly inferior to the demons. The three sect masters of the Three Sects Alliance haven't shown signs of breaking through to the late Transformation God stage.  Unless something unexpected occurs, they will be suppressed by the demons and will rely on Liuli to resist the foreign races.</p><p>Daoist, Buddhist, and Demon sects have different cultivation philosophies.  Logically, they shouldn't get along, and conflict is bound to erupt one day, leading to their eventual disintegration.</p><p>But repeated external upheavals forced the Three Sects Alliance to unite against outside threats. Their internal conflicts were channeled outwards, making the three major sects increasingly close-knit.</p><p>At this time, the three sect masters gathered at the headquarters of the Three Sects Alliance.</p><p>Night had fallen; moonlight shone into the headquarters, illuminating the shadows of palaces and towers, exceptionally peaceful.  Inside a simple, grand hall, lights blazed brightly.</p><p>Three figures sat high in the hall. One was Hegao Zhenjun, the current master of the Eight Scenic Spots.</p><p>Opposite Hegao Zhenjun sat a young man in a black robe, with a thin face, a soft temperament, and striking white hair and eyebrows – Kuru Rong Lao Mo, who had once met Qin Sang.</p><p>After the death of the previous master of Tianhao Tower, Kuru Rong Lao Mo took over. He lived up to expectations, not only making rapid progress in his own cultivation but also leading Tianhao Tower to prosperity.</p><p>Sitting between Hegao Zhenjun and Kuru Rong Lao Mo was an old monk, also an acquaintance of Qin Sang –  Xingren Master, now revered as Xingren Sage.</p><p>Xingren Sage was the senior brother of Xingji Master, the previous abbot of Ganlu Zen Temple, and took over after Xingji Master's death.</p><p>Among the three, Xingren Sage was the oldest in terms of seniority.  In terms of cultivation, however, the youngest, Kuru Rong Lao Mo, was slightly more advanced due to his extraordinary talent.</p><p>"Kuru Rong Lao Mo, you summoned me and Xingren Sage. What urgent matter is it?" Hegao Zhenjun looked at Kuru Rong Lao Mo, getting straight to the point.</p><p>For hundreds of years, the Three Sects Alliance had established various regulations.  High-level cultivators constantly guard the headquarters, so the three sect masters rarely need to appear together.  Moreover, they need to focus on cultivation, striving for an early breakthrough to the late Transformation God stage. Their meetings are infrequent.</p><p>Kuru Rong Lao Mo gently waved his hand, activating the hall's defensive formations and setting up a spell-blocking barrier.</p><p>This was the headquarters of the Three Sects Alliance; his cautious actions caused Hegao Zhenjun and Xingren Sage to subtly narrow their eyes.</p><p>"That Li Guan Zhu seems determined to rebuild his sect, no matter the cost."</p><p>Kuru Rong Lao Mo said slowly.</p><p>Hegao Zhenjun frowned.  "This has already been confirmed! I personally visited to confirm this matter. The Qingyang Temple has clearly been planning this for a long time and won't give up due to external objections."</p><p>"Then, Zhenjun, do you think the words of the Jiao Dragon King and the Golden Toad King at the Tripartite Conference were merely threats, intended only to stop the Qingyang Temple?" Kuru Rong Lao Mo looked at Hegao Zhenjun and chuckled.</p><p>Xingren Sage stirred, chanting a Buddhist prayer. "Friend, do you know something? There are no outsiders here; please speak frankly."</p><p>Kuru Rong Lao Mo spread his hands, saying, "I have no concrete evidence, but it's not mere speculation either.  You both know the Jiao Long Wang's temperament. This demon, self-proclaimed descendant of a true dragon, is arrogant and overbearing. His words cannot be taken as a simple threat. And that Dragon Whale, it never acts without self-interest.  Its support for the Jiao Long Wang at the three-race council clearly indicates a secret pact."</p><p>He Gao Zhenjun mused, "You mean the Jiao Long Wang is possibly plotting to reclaim the Demon Sea?"</p><p>"Qingyang Temple made a good start!" Kuru Rong Lao Mo sneered. "The Demon Sea is not only their ancestral land, but also near the Foul Lands, making it more advantageous for the struggle for the Qingling energy. Once the Jiao Long Wang and the Dragon Whale Saint both break through, even without the human and witch clans, the demon clan will have the power to reclaim the Demon Sea!"</p><p>Xing Ren Shengzhe and He Gao Zhenjun fell silent, understanding that this was quite possible.</p><p>"This is hard to stop," sighed Xing Ren Shengzhe.</p><p>If the demon clan becomes strong, the human race must first defend against their suppression; how could they provoke them?</p><p>He Gao Zhenjun nodded slightly, pondering, "However, reclaiming the Demon Sea won't be that easy. The Chang You clan will never give up easily, unless the Jiao Long Wang is willing to pay a heavy price."</p><p>The human race is powerless to prevent it, but they cannot be coerced either. The Dragon Whale King may not fully support the Jiao Long Wang.</p><p>"Given the Jiao Long Wang's intelligence, he won't willingly accept losses. So, what's the best course of action?"</p><p>Kuru Rong Lao Mo looked at the two, answering his own question, "Divert the enemy!"</p><p>As long as they manage to draw away the Chang You clan's army, the pressure to reclaim the Demon Sea will naturally be greatly reduced.</p><p>The question is, is the Jiao Long Wang targeting the Central State or the North Sea?</p><p>Xing Ren Shengzhe and He Gao Zhenjun both looked grave.</p><p>Kuru Rong Lao Mo continued his analysis, "That Dragon Whale, while a demon, is also quite pragmatic. I think it's comfortable in the East Sea and may not want to move to the Demon Sea and be at someone else's mercy. If the Jiao Long Wang targets the Central State, it won't agree. That leaves only the North Sea.  Liuli Xianzi is in seclusion, Qingyang Temple is constantly drawing manpower. When their protective mountain array is completed, they might even invite allies. The North Sea will be unprecedentedly vulnerable…"</p><p>At this point, Kuru Rong Lao Mo paused, needing to say no more.</p><p>Kuru Rong Lao Mo's analysis seemed logical.</p><p>But He Gao Zhenjun sensed something unusual. Kuru Rong Lao Mo's tone was too certain, as if things would certainly unfold as he said.</p><p>"Have you found out something?"</p><p>??????55.??????</p><p>He Gao Zhenjun stared at Kuru Rong Lao Mo.</p><p>Kuru Rong Lao Mo neither confirmed nor denied it, saying calmly, "This isn't important. What matters is, if the North Sea is in danger, will you two rescue it or not? When will you rescue it? How will you rescue it?"</p><p>Three consecutive questions, hitting the core of the problem.</p><p>There's an ancient teleportation array between the Central State and the North Sea. If they fully support, reinforcements can arrive quickly.</p><p>"Liuli Xianzi cannot be harmed! The North Sea must not fall!" Xing Ren Shengzhe declared.</p><p>Kuru Rong Lao Mo and He Gao Zhenjun offered no objection.</p><p>The North Sea definitely needs saving. At least, before they break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, they still rely on Liuli Xianzi's strength and cannot let her be harmed.</p><p>But when to send troops, and how many troops to send, requires careful consideration.</p><p>Of course, they could now warn Liuli Xianzi and Li Yu Fu, stating the severity of the situation, urging Qingyang Temple to abandon the rebuilding of their sect to prevent the situation from worsening.</p><p>But none of the three sect leaders suggested this option, tacitly choosing to ignore it.</p><p>"Indeed, we cannot allow the North Sea to fall, but we can use this opportunity to let Liuli Xianzi and Qingyang Temple understand that without our support, they cannot resist the Chang You clan!"</p><p>Kuru Rong Lao Mo swept his gaze over the two, saying gravely, "The Central State has always been blessed with talented people and heroes, far surpassing the North Sea and other places. It deserves a larger share of Qingling energy!"</p><p>Xing Ren Shengzhe and He Gao Zhenjun exchanged a glance, understanding Kuru Rong Lao Mo's intentions. No one wants a desperate struggle, but before the 'net' is broken, there is room for maneuvering.</p><p>He Gao Zhenjun hesitated, "The alliance is in place. If our reinforcements are not timely, delaying the battle, it will give people an excuse to criticize us. If Liuli Xianzi uses this to attack us…"</p><p>They didn't want to break with the North Sea.</p><p>Xing Ren Shengzhe and He Gao Zhenjun both looked at Kuru Rong Lao Mo. This old demon had always seemed confident, certainly having planned a countermeasure before inviting them.</p><p>Kuru Rong Lao Mo, seeing the time was right, stopped beating around the bush, saying, "Zhenjun's concerns are valid, but there is a solution.  Please see, my friends."</p><p>Saying this, Kuru Rong Lao Mo took out a jade slip and placed it on the table.</p><p>A quick scan of the jade slip revealed its contents, causing both Xingren and Hegao to show surprise.</p><p>“The spiritual treasure I envision, combining the strengths of Daoism, Buddhism, and Demonism, will be wielded by the three of us. It's powerful enough to withstand a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, even two might not be a match! Once this treasure is refined, even if we haven't broken through, we'll fear no faction!”</p><p>Kuru's eyes flashed with confidence, his arrogance reaching the heavens.</p><p>Xingren and Hegao were amazed by Kuru's ingenuity, but not as optimistic.  Kuru's design was still incomplete, merely a concept.</p><p>It seemed feasible, but failure remained a possibility.</p><p>Kuru's plan required all three of them to jointly comprehend and refine the treasure.</p><p>Each possessed exceptional talent, their paths unbroken, with a chance to reach the late Nascent Soul stage in the future.  Whether delaying their cultivation for an uncertain treasure was worthwhile remained a question.</p><p>“However…”</p><p>Xingren began to speak, but Kuru interrupted.</p><p>“We'll use refining this treasure as a pretext for seclusion, leaving the sect to our subordinates.  They can adapt as needed.  If we succeed, we’ll stand equal to Fairy Liuli. If we fail, we can use this incomplete scroll to explain ourselves if she attacks later.”</p><p>Kuru fell silent, having laid out the risks and benefits. He believed they'd make the right decision.</p><p>Silence fell over the hall.  After much thought, Hegao spoke first, followed by Xingren's quiet nod of assent.</p><p>The three then continued their discussions until dawn, before departing from the Three Teach Alliance headquarters.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Jiannu's residence was on a peak beside the main one. Huanhen often visited to seek instruction in swordsmanship.</p><p>One day, after Huanhen helped Li Yu further refine the mountain-protecting formation, he eagerly returned and activated the restriction.</p><p>“Senior Jiannu, it's me.”</p><p>A flash of light appeared before the cave entrance, and Jiannu's calm voice echoed, “Enter.”</p><p>Huanhen entered with a respectful expression, bowed, and voiced his questions about the sword path.</p><p>Their interactions were always like this—two sword cultivators focused solely on the sword.</p><p>Jiannu didn't directly answer Huanhen, but guided him to find his own answers.</p><p>Their sword styles differed. Huanhen practiced a style derived from the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, while Jiannu's was passed down from the First Sword Attendant to Tianyue, a different lineage from the fourteen sword pavilions of Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang would certainly refine Huanhen's techniques in the future.  Misguiding him now would be unhelpful.</p><p>Years ago, Tianyue, under the alias "Sword Bearer," had guided Qin Sang similarly.</p><p>Huanhen fell into deep thought.  Each lesson didn't bring sudden enlightenment, but the more he pondered, the more profound the meaning became, his admiration for Jiannu growing boundless.</p><p>He still had questions, but wasn't impatient.  Collecting himself, he said respectfully, “Senior, I have a message from the Temple Master.”</p><p>Huanhen then briefly recounted recent events.</p><p>While there were no clear signs yet, intelligence from Gui Hou and others indicated growing danger in the North Sea.</p><p>They wanted to lure out their enemies, but not at the cost of the North Sea's fall.  Preemptive measures were needed.</p><p>Among those below the Void Refinement stage, Jiannu was the strongest.  Having him stationed in the North Sea was the best course of action.</p><p>Jiannu nodded slightly.  “Very well. I had you sheathe your sword, cultivate your intent. It’s time to draw it again!”</p><p>Huanhen’s eyes lit up. Since childhood at Qingyang Temple, he had faced many foes.  Jiannu’s initial order to sheathe his sword felt unnatural, but he'd eventually understood its value.</p><p>He felt transformed, eager for a worthy opponent.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Jiannu poured cold water on his enthusiasm.  “Your swordsmanship differs from mine.  Cultivate my method of sword cultivation; when you draw your blade, don't rush. Otherwise, your strength will dissipate, and your efforts will be wasted!”</p><p>Huanhen’s expression turned serious.  “Please instruct me, Senior!”</p><p>“Hide your identity, seal your cultivation, enter the battlefield, and start anew.  Relive the path of sword refinement; you will achieve great success! It's dangerous, so consider carefully,” said Jiannu.</p><p>Huanhen seemed to understand.</p><p>The next day, Jiannu left Qingyang Temple, accompanied by a young man carrying a sword.  The young man was unremarkable in appearance and demeanor.</p>
