<h1>Chapter 366: The Guide</h1><p>Entering the marketplace, Wandering Cloud strolled around, stopping occasionally, until he arrived at a shop named "Skywind Tower". He stepped inside.</p><p>The shop was a simple, single-story stone building, rather humorously called a "tower". The shopkeeper, a vigorous old man, sat inside, fiddling with a magical artifact, his aura remarkably subtle.</p><p>Qin Sang, using the Spirit Concealment Technique to disguise himself as an early Foundation Establishment cultivator, followed Wandering Cloud inside. He realized he couldn't see through the shopkeeper's cultivation, and a sense of awe arose within him.</p><p>He knew that these shops were often backed by powerful forces, some even directly affiliated with major sects. This man, stationed in Boundless Valley, was undoubtedly someone of significant status and strength.</p><p>"Greetings, fellow Daoist. I'd like to purchase a map of the first two levels of Boundless Valley. I wonder if your shop has any for sale?" Wandering Cloud asked with clasped hands.</p><p>Although the second level wasn't as unpredictable as the first, for safety's sake, buying a map for confirmation was a wise precaution.</p><p>The shopkeeper put down the item in his hand. Seeing the cultivation levels of Qin Sang and Wandering Cloud, a smile immediately spread across his face as he stood up and hurried out to greet them. "Welcome, esteemed Daoists! Your presence brings honor to my humble shop! Please, come in!"</p><p>The three sat down. As the shopkeeper poured tea, he said, "You've come to the right place. My shop indeed sells maps. We have three tiers, each differing in focus and detail. Which tier are you interested in?"</p><p>Wandering Cloud pondered for a moment. "We are newcomers here, intending to gather spirit herbs in Boundless Valley. The more detailed the map, the better..."</p><p>The shopkeeper's smile deepened as he stroked his long beard. "The most detailed is, of course, the highest tier. However, the price..."</p><p>Wandering Cloud, showing his wealth, declared, "As long as the map is sufficiently detailed, the price is not an issue!"</p><p>After paying the spirit stones and receiving a jade slip from the shopkeeper, both Wandering Cloud and Qin Sang frowned upon examining its contents.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the shopkeeper with dissatisfaction, questioning, "Are you making sport of us? This map has a few routes marked with decent detail in the initial sections. But further in, it becomes a blur.  The inner areas of the first level are barely marked. And you dare call this the best map?"</p><p>The shopkeeper seemed unfazed by Qin Sang's reaction. He immediately protested, "Fellow Daoist, you misunderstand. Boundless Valley is constantly changing. A map that fully satisfies your requirements is simply impossible. The beast tide in Boundless Valley has only recently subsided. These routes were painstakingly explored by our joint chambers of commerce, at great effort. Following these routes, as long as there are no major upheavals, your safety is practically guaranteed."</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, feigning anger. "What use is safety? These routes don't even cover half of the first level, and there's hardly anything of value along the way.  There's not a single marking for Golden Dragon Grass. What good is this to us? Are we supposed to just go in for a sightseeing tour and then come back out...?"</p><p>Tugged by Wandering Cloud, Qin Sang pretended to be embarrassed, yet still indignant.</p><p>"Do you two intend to gather Golden Dragon Grass?" The shopkeeper asked with a look of understanding, then quickly explained, "It seems you are indeed visiting Boundless Valley for the first time...</p><p>"To be frank, there are indeed some areas within Boundless Valley where Golden Dragon Grass grows, but they are all located in hazardous areas deep within the first level.</p><p>"If you had come a while ago, there were actually a few locations that had been explored.</p><p>"However, after the beast tide, Boundless Valley underwent a dramatic transformation. Previously safe places are now occupied by beasts or have become demonic nests. This is quite common. The spirit herbs within have naturally been consumed or destroyed by those beasts.</p><p>"I dare not mark the map indiscriminately, lest I mislead you.</p><p>"If you insist, I can provide you with a map marking those locations, and you can explore them yourselves.</p><p>"Besides that, there's another way..." The shopkeeper paused, suddenly stopping.</p><p>Wandering Cloud placed his hand on the table and said firmly, "If you have a solution to our problem, the reward will not be a problem."</p><p>Receiving the promise, the shopkeeper smiled with satisfaction and leaned forward slightly. "You could find a guide to lead you inside... If you trust me, I can recommend someone to you."</p><p>"A guide?" Wandering Cloud looked hesitant. "Is there anyone who knows Boundless Valley better than you?"</p><p>The shopkeeper nodded. "Those who know Boundless Valley best are not us, but the desperate individuals who dwell within it.</p><p>"As soon as the beast tide ended, before the valley even stabilized, they ventured in, disregarding the dangers.  They are the ones who first explored Boundless Valley.</p><p>"They wouldn't readily sell their maps to us, and the valley is ever-changing. Only they are aware of the latest developments.</p><p>"In fact, if you walk around the marketplace or go to the entrance of Boundless Valley, you'll easily encounter people calling themselves guides. However, many of these people are unreliable and untrustworthy.</p><p>"As the shopkeeper of Skywind Tower, with my reputation on the line, I only recommend individuals with a certain degree of credibility."</p><p>Wandering Cloud and Qin Sang exchanged glances.</p><p>They knew the shopkeeper wasn't lying. They had chosen Skywind Tower precisely for its reputation, to avoid deceitful individuals and wasted time.</p><p>The person recommended by the shopkeeper might not be entirely reliable, but the shopkeeper would have to consider Skywind Tower's reputation and generally wouldn't act recklessly.</p><p>They pretended to discuss briefly, and Wandering Cloud spoke, "In that case, we'll trouble you for the introduction. We'll decide after meeting with the guide."</p><p>The shopkeeper readily agreed and immediately took out several transmission talismans and activated them.</p><p>Soon, a transmission talisman flew back into the shop. After examining it, the shopkeeper's face brightened. "It just so happens that a guide has organized a group and is about to depart.  This person knows a location where Golden Dragon Grass grows and is willing to lead the way. If you're interested, I'll take you there to meet and discuss the details."</p><p>Hearing this, Wandering Cloud and Qin Sang immediately stood up.</p><p>"Please, follow me!"</p><p>The shopkeeper led the way, arriving at a wooden hut behind the mountain ridge. "Here it is..."</p><p>As he spoke, the shopkeeper sent a surge of spiritual energy to activate the hut's restrictions.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>The door was pushed open from the inside, and a young man who looked to be in his early thirties stepped out.</p><p>The young man's cultivation was not concealed, and it was similar to Wandering Cloud's.</p><p>For some reason, despite being a cultivator, his face was deathly pale, devoid of any color.  His thin frame gave the impression of extreme frailty, like a mortal suffering from severe blood deficiency. This was quite surprising.</p><p>"Kong Xin greets Senior!" The young man bowed to the shopkeeper, then turned his gaze to Wandering Cloud and Qin Sang.  "Greetings, fellow Daoists."</p>
