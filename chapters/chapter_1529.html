<h1>Chapter 1520: Remembering Sui</h1><p>"In the beginning, when the Founder established Azure Goat Temple, heroes from all across the Northstar Realm gathered, and Nascent Soul Grandmasters assembled like clouds. With a single strike of his sword, the Founder sheared off the cliff face, yet the mountain did not tremble, nor did dust rise. He awed the assembled heroes, and none dared to disobey. This event has been passed down as a legendary tale..."</p><p>Tan Yi'en pointed to the massive characters carved into the sheer cliff face, grandiosely extolling Qin Sang's accomplishments.</p><p>Establishing the sect was only part of it.</p><p>His words stirred the blood of the young disciples, filling them with utmost reverence for the mysterious Founder.</p><p>Tan Yi'en observed this, nodding subtly, a faint smile playing on his lips, his face alight with anticipation.</p><p>Qin Sang had completely relinquished control.</p><p>Li Yufu, Aunt Mei, Shangguan Lifeng, and the others were all devoted to the path of cultivation, either in secluded meditation or traveling the world, seeking opportunities for breakthroughs.</p><p>Unless it involved major decisions, they rarely interfered with Tan Yi'en.</p><p>Tan Yi'en had no restraints within the sect.</p><p>His gaze shifted from the disciples and swept across the magnificent landscape of Azure Goat Temple, a scene of vibrant life and flourishing growth.</p><p>Azure Goat Temple's current state was also due to his efforts!</p><p>Its future growth into the foremost great sect of the Lesser Cold Domain, and even the entire Northstar Realm, was within reach.</p><p>At this thought, Tan Yi'en felt a surge of ambition and thoroughly enjoyed this feeling.</p><p>"First, take them to the rear mountain dormitories..."</p><p>Tan Yi'en turned and spoke to a young man beside him.</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, a crimson cloud suddenly flew toward the mountain gate.</p><p>This was Bai Hanqiu's flying magical artifact, which Qin Sang had personally refined for her. Its speed rivaled that of a true spiritual treasure, and it was unique within Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>Tan Yi'en smiled. "Hanqiu is back... Eh? Who is this?"</p><p>The crimson cloud landed before Tan Yi'en, revealing Bai Hanqiu and a young man dressed in opulent clothing.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu had long since shed her youthful naiveté and carried herself with grace and elegance.</p><p>The young man had delicate features, wearing brocade robes and a jade pendant at his waist. Despite his young age, he possessed an air of authority, likely the scion of a noble family.</p><p>Facing the legendary cultivators, the young man clenched his fists, somewhat restrained, but his eyes did not flinch. He mustered his courage to meet Tan Yi'en's scrutinizing gaze.</p><p>Of course, this was also because Tan Yi'en was not releasing the aura of a Core Formation stage cultivator.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu was Qin Sang's disciple. Although her cultivation was not high, her status within Azure Goat Temple was extremely elevated. For her to personally bring someone here, the young man's identity was likely...</p><p>Tan Yi'en looked at Bai Hanqiu with a questioning gaze.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu nodded and said in a solemn voice, "This child's name is Qin Niansui, a member of a collateral branch of the Qin family. His bloodline has been confirmed... A three-element spiritual root!"</p><p>The Qin family, as the imperial clan, had expanded its branches over the centuries, becoming an enormous family with countless collateral lines.</p><p>Qin Niansui was the only member of the Qin family to possess a spiritual root.</p><p>"The Qin family! A three-element spiritual root!"</p><p>Tan Yi'en took a deep breath, overjoyed. "The Founder finally has a successor!"</p><p>The two communicated through voice transmission, discussing how to arrange for Qin Niansui, even considering whether to alert Li Yufu and the others to collectively decide who would take him as a disciple.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>A faint fluctuation appeared at the mountain gate, unnoticed by the guarding disciples.</p><p>Then, two figures materialized out of thin air beside Tan Yi'en and Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>Tan Yi'en was the first to detect the anomaly, and he was greatly alarmed. But when he saw the newcomers, his alarm turned to joy. He bent down to pay his respects, "Disciple greets the Founder..."</p><p>Halfway through his bow, Tan Yi'en finally saw the appearance of the person behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Tan Hao did not conceal his cultivation, and his gaze was filled with fatherly affection.</p><p>"Father..."</p><p>Tan Yi'en was stunned, his mouth agape.</p><p>He knew that Qin Sang was going to the Northern Sea to find his father, but he didn't expect it to be so soon. Even more unexpected was that his father had become a Nascent Soul Grandmaster!</p><p>Bai Hanqiu did not recognize Tan Hao, but she gracefully bowed to Qin Sang, paying respects to her Master.</p><p>However, someone was faster than her.</p><p>Qin Niansui, seeing Qin Sang, who looked exactly like the ancestor in the portrait, did not hesitate. He knelt down with a thud and kowtowed, his voice clear and resonant, "Unworthy descendant Qin Niansui pays respects to the Ancestor!"</p><p>"Niansui..."</p><p>Looking at this young man from the Qin family, Qin Sang, for some reason, suddenly recalled the time when he first arrived in this world, searching for the Immortal path in the Great Sui Dynasty.</p><p>Qin Niansui didn't understand and didn't dare to raise his head. He spoke clearly, "Your descendant's original name was Qin Yaowu. Before leaving, His Majesty bestowed the name Niansui."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled inwardly.</p><p>The current Emperor, he wondered which generation descendant of Qin Sanwa he was.</p><p>He had almost no emotional connection with the descendants of the Qin family. Elevating the Qin family to the imperial throne was also a consideration of repaying this physical body.</p><p>Now, the Qin family had produced another disciple with cultivation talent, and a three-element spiritual root at that, a fresh start.</p><p>He could be considered to have completed his merit.</p><p>"Take him with the other disciples and send him to the dormitories," Qin Sang said to the young man waiting nearby.</p><p>"Disciple obeys."</p><p>The young man glanced at Qin Niansui and led the group away.</p><p>Disappointment flashed in Qin Niansui's eyes, but he took it as his ancestor testing him and remained full of ambition.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured for Bai Hanqiu to follow him, so as not to disturb the reunion of father and son.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu was somewhat unsure of Qin Sang's intentions. She hesitated for a moment and asked, "Master, Niansui's future..."</p><p>"He need not be given excessive preferential treatment. In Azure Goat Temple, he is just an ordinary disciple. The several legacies of Azure Goat Temple are sufficient for him to choose from. We shall observe his character and see how he performs," Qin Sang said淡淡.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu looked ashamed and silently agreed, swallowing the words she was about to say.</p><p>"Send a message to Yufu and the others, as well as all disciples above the Foundation Establishment stage, to return to the mountain gate immediately. In one month, your Master has an important announcement to make."</p><p>Qin Sang left this command and then directly departed from Azure Goat Temple, slowly flying towards the Great Sui Dynasty.</p><p>On this journey.</p><p>He first landed at the place where he had awakened from the prison cart, then followed the Witch Ridge River downstream, arriving at the former ferry crossing, and ascending Emerald Bright Mountain.</p><p>On Emerald Bright Mountain, the old Azure Goat Temple was preserved in its original state.</p><p>Below the mountainside, a new temple of grand scale had been built.</p><p>Legend had it that more than one Immortal had emerged from Emerald Bright Mountain, and the place was thriving with incense offerings, with a constant stream of pilgrims.</p><p>Bai Jianglan, the Water Monkey, Silent Heart Daoist, Mingyue...</p><p>Familiar names, now recalled, seemed somewhat distant.</p><p>Cultivators had photographic memories, but over time, some unimportant memories would gradually blur, only surfacing when the heart was touched.</p><p>After a brief stay on Emerald Bright Mountain, Qin Sang entered the Three巫 City, now renamed Azure Goat City.</p><p>The descendants of the steamed bun shop owner were surprisingly still there, operating the same business in the original location, but the taste had changed.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly and continued northward, following the path of his former military expedition, stopping and going, eventually reaching the capital city.</p><p>He did not enter the palace to see the descendants of the Qin family, but instead, he ascended the Sacred Pilgrimage Mountain alone.</p><p>The Sacred Pilgrimage Mountain had become a true sacred ground. Tan Yi'en had dispatched people to guard it. Without permission, even the Emperor of the Great Sui Dynasty could not set foot on the Sacred Pilgrimage Mountain.</p><p>The mountain was serene and secluded.</p><p>The area around the Empress's mausoleum had become a forbidden zone, where no one was allowed to enter.</p><p>Qin Sang walked up slowly, paused for a moment, waved his hand to open the seal he had personally placed, and saw the wordless stone stele.</p>
