<h1>Chapter 1139: A Bluff</h1><p>Chapter 1139: A Bluff</p><p>Li Hong, the妖王, insisted on meeting the master of Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, likely testing the waters and harboring suspicions.</p><p>Qin Sang's daring gamble stemmed from his knowledge of the situation at Heaven Demon Hill.  He knew the Feather妖王 had sent Li Hong to contact other妖 kings for reinforcements.</p><p>Spending considerable time at Heaven Demon Hill, Qin Sang had observed the internal power dynamics among the妖. With the Crime Abyss army pressing in, the Feather妖王 wouldn't create further trouble by attacking other妖 kings without reason.</p><p>This is why Qin Sang dared to remain in Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea.  As long as it wasn't the Feather妖王's orders, Li Hong, wary of the consequences, wouldn't dare to act recklessly.</p><p>Just before Li Hong's arrival, they received news of unusual activity from Nine Caves Mountain. It was likely that Li Hong was instigated by the Nine Caves妖王 to act on his own.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang knew that if he couldn't form his Nascent Soul soon, this charade wouldn't last. The remaining prestige of the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea master would fade, and his deception would eventually be uncovered.</p><p>That would be the day Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea fell.</p><p>He, the Willow Spirit, and Old Monkey had been preparing an escape route.  As a last resort, they would take their loyal followers and flee across the Ice Sea.</p><p>“Who is this?”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the white-tailed black fox, his eyes revealing contempt and displeasure.</p><p>Disguising himself as a powerful transformed妖 before Li Hong was incredibly stressful.  However, he'd encountered many Nascent Soul-level cultivators, even facing formidable ancient demons, so he remained composed before Li Hong. His presence was strong.</p><p>“Greetings to Your Majesty, the妖王!”</p><p>The white-tailed black fox, terrified, hurriedly bowed.</p><p>Li Hong, uncertain, stared intently at Qin Sang, finding no flaws in his demeanor.  Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea was protected by two powerful妖 kings, one of whom was the unfathomable Bamboo Elder.  He dared not press further, softening his tone.  “Unexpectedly, I've met a new fellow daoist today. Heaven Demon Hill welcomes another妖王!  It’s a joyous occasion!  Unfortunately, the Feather妖王 and I were unaware, and haven’t prepared a gift. Bamboo Elder truly keeps a low profile.  Such a talented disciple, hidden for so long, finally reveals themselves to the world…”</p><p>“I was a lowly妖 from Boundless Valley, living a carefree life until my master enlightened me, finally setting me on the right path, allowing me to transform.  I didn't know many fellow daoists in Heaven Demon Hill, so I've been secluded in my cave cultivating, rarely leaving Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea…”</p><p>Qin Sang replied calmly.</p><p>“Boundless Valley?”</p><p>Li Hong's pupils constricted. He chuckled, “No wonder!  I've heard that many fellow daoists in Boundless Valley are oppressed by humans.  For a daoist to earn Bamboo Elder’s favor speaks volumes about your talent and good fortune.  Meeting you is an honor.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, “After my transformation, I intended to visit the Feather妖王 in Ten Thousand妖 City personally, but I've been too busy…”</p><p>…</p><p>The meeting ended amicably. Qin Sang personally escorted Li Hong out of the valley.</p><p>Back in the basin, Qin Sang's smile vanished, and he flew back to his cave.</p><p>The Willow Spirit and Old Monkey followed closely behind.</p><p>Closing the cave, the two妖 let out a sigh of relief, their fear palpable.  Seeing Qin Sang act as if nothing had happened, they could only admire his audaciousness.</p><p>“The kids thought we had two great kings ruling Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea when they saw Qin Gongzi.  They were overjoyed, jumping for joy, hehe…”</p><p>Old Monkey chuckled dryly, his voice tinged with bitterness.</p><p>The Willow Spirit raised a jade slip, saying, “Qin Gongzi, the numbers here are comparable to other妖 kings.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “Then deploy troops according to these numbers, not one less.  We must avoid gossip and those seeking trouble.  Keep a close watch on Nine Caves Mountain.  If they remain hostile, our formation can buy us time, but it will also expose our deception, attracting others with ill intentions to attack.  Then we’ll have to implement our worst-case plan – send your loyalists to the Ice Sea, find an iceberg, and endure the harsh conditions until I form my Nascent Soul…”</p><p>Without protection, the weak妖 would be slaughtered, and Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea would be devastated.</p><p>But Qin Sang's abilities were limited; this was all he could do.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The two妖 responded in unison. Old Monkey went to carry out his orders, already treating Qin Sang as the true master of Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea.</p><p>"What important matter does the Feather King have?"</p><p>the willow spirit asked with concern.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, "Old Monster Li Hong is just being mysterious! If the fighting were fierce, the Feather King would personally lead reinforcements. Judging by the situation, that shouldn't happen for several years. However, this matter is not to be taken lightly.  There are currently two demon kings openly in the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, and one will inevitably have to be dispatched. If I don't show myself soon, they will surely become suspicious. You must prepare yourselves for the possibility of my Core Formation failing…"</p><p>The willow spirit's face was full of worry. Suddenly remembering something, he said repeatedly, "Master Qin, I didn't have time to mention earlier, but we've uncovered some clues regarding the Trigger Demon King."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed upon hearing this.  "News of the stone tablet?"</p><p>"Not exactly."</p><p>The willow spirit said apologetically, "However, we've located the Trigger Demon King's lair, and two other places which may be his treasure vaults."</p><p>"The Trigger Demon King didn't keep his treasures in his lair? Please elaborate," Qin Sang said in surprise.</p><p>The mysterious stone tablet couldn't be stored in a dimensional pouch.  If he could find the location of the demon king's treasure vault, he would have a chance.</p><p>The willow spirit nodded and said, "The Trigger Demon King's lair is at the bottom of the Myriad Serpents Abyss. Although it's not entirely populated by snake demons, infiltrating the Myriad Serpents Abyss still took considerable effort. Around the Trigger Demon King's lair, we also found two hidden caves, heavily guarded. We only dared to observe from afar. The Trigger Demon King, a black-spotted king snake who cultivated into a demon, is by nature cunning and suspicious. We suspect that he may not have kept his treasures in his lair; those two locations may also be his treasure vaults…"</p><p>"Three treasure vaults, real and fake, guarded not only by the Trigger Demon King's own enchantments but also by constant guards…"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, finding the situation quite difficult.</p><p>His intention was simple: to activate the phantom within the stone tablet and visualize the true Azure Luan.  That would achieve his objective, without actually needing to steal the tablet.</p><p>According to Qin Sang's previous plan, he would find an opportunity to infiltrate the Trigger Demon King's lair, using his Heavenly Eye Divine Ability to forcibly break the treasure vault's enchantments and take a quick look.</p><p>Even if he was discovered by the Trigger Demon King, he wouldn't suffer any significant losses, and the Trigger Demon King likely wouldn't relentlessly pursue him.</p><p>Given the Trigger Demon King's suspicious nature, his underlings probably wouldn't even know which treasure vault was the real one, and therefore couldn't possibly report it.</p><p>He had to try each of the three treasure vaults.  If he guessed wrong, and was discovered by the Trigger Demon King, the security would certainly be tightened.</p><p>He only had one chance.</p>
