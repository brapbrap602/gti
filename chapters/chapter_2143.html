<h1>Chapter 2133: Retirement</h1><p>The Azure Luan True Thunder struck, instantly shattering the magical power.</p><p>Min Zhuo, using a sliver of time he'd barely managed to buy, finally unleashed a spiritual treasure.</p><p>The treasure resembled a bowl, empty within, yet its inner surface was etched with intricate, lifelike patterns depicting a landscape.</p><p>Mountains embraced by a lake, the water a vibrant blue, the mountains verdant green—a scene brought to life.</p><p>The bowl expanded, the painted landscape unfolding, the mountains and water seeming to emerge from the painting and into reality.</p><p>Simultaneously, above Min Zhuo, ripples appeared in the void; faint outlines of mountain peaks, identical to those in the bowl, became visible.</p><p>Mountains crowned Min Zhuo's head, and azure water swirled around him, murmuring softly.</p><p>Before the landscape could fully materialize, the Azure Luan True Thunder exploded.  A deafening roar erupted as countless bolts of azure lightning slammed into the illusory landscape.</p><p>In an instant, the illusion shattered, brilliant light flashed violently, and all the spectral forms disintegrated, swept away by the thunder's power. The bowl fell from the air. The treasure, unable to fully display its power, reverted to its original form, but it had nonetheless deflected some of the lightning.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>With no barrier left before him, the residual thunder's might swept over Min Zhuo, engulfing him in its light.</p><p>At that moment, the wax figures in the Changyou clan's ancestral hall burst into flames.</p><p>The light dispersed, revealing Min Zhuo pale and disheveled, his expression contorted in pain. He was injured in the exchange, the disparity in strength disheartening.</p><p>And he still faced the threat of the wax figures. If he couldn't escape before they burned out, the injuries transferring back to his true form would add to his existing wounds, instantly incapacitating him.</p><p>Min Zhuo no longer harbored any ambition to contest Mount Daiyu; escape was his sole thought.</p><p>The bowl tumbled towards the abyss, seemingly out of control.</p><p>Suddenly, a deep blue light burst forth from the bowl, and the sound of crashing waves filled the air.</p><p>The void seemed to conceal countless quantities of water, now drawn out by the bowl. The abyss, previously isolated from the outside sea, was once clean and fresh, but now rippled with waves, water filling every space.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, this water was composed of countless minuscule droplets, so small and dense as to be indistinguishable to the naked eye—only cultivators could perceive them.</p><p>At the same time, Min Zhuo's body grew translucent and exploded. This suicidal act, however, showed no scattering of flesh and blood; his body disintegrated into countless tiny water droplets, perfectly blending with the surrounding water, his very essence vanishing.</p><p>Perhaps Min Zhuo was hidden within an insignificant droplet, or perhaps his body truly fragmented, his essence dispersed among all the droplets. As long as one droplet escaped, he could survive.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. He knew this was a superior magical power; if the Sky Eye Butterfly were present, it could easily pinpoint the opponent's true form. However, he wasn't helpless.</p><p>The water was essentially Min Zhuo controlling the ambient spiritual energy, transformed by the power of the treasure.</p><p>The Azure Luan's form and Min Zhuo were both at the initial stage of their respective realms, making the difference in their ability to control spiritual energy less significant, though a gap still existed.</p><p>Body cultivators and spirit cultivators differ in their cultivation paths. The realms corresponding to the Nascent Soul and Void Refinement stages are known as Inner Scene and Outer Scene, respectively. At the Inner Scene stage, one begins to display the characteristic of drawing upon the abundant creation of heaven and earth to enrich oneself; this continues in the Outer Scene.</p><p>A magical form can be seen as one manifestation of the Outer Scene, but the Outer Scene isn't limited to such forms.</p><p>Other body cultivation lineages might exhibit different expressions.</p><p>The Azure Luan form paused, its wings unfurling. The ambient spiritual energy immediately reacted, visible streams of spiritual energy filling the void, forming a spiritual tide, rushing towards the form.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Mount Daiyu's tremors intensified.</p><p>The ancient prohibitions surrounding the battlefield, previously relatively stable, now stirred restlessly.</p><p>Void Refinement cultivators rarely allow themselves to be drawn into a pure struggle for spiritual energy, as the situation easily becomes uncontrollable, but when it begins, the spectacle is inevitably grand.</p><p>Endless spiritual energy was consumed by the Azure Luan form. Its wings, like the shadow of clouds hanging in the sky, overshadowed the abyss. Each wingbeat seemed capable of leveling the abyss, bearing a hint of the legendary divine bird's aura.</p><p>The uncontrolled spiritual energy was soon devoured entirely by the Azure Luan form. Next came the contest for the spiritual energy already controlled by Min Zhuo.</p><p>'Bang bang bang…'</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Numerous splashes erupted on the battlefield, transforming into pure spiritual energy, seized by the Azure Luan form.</p><p>The water, its essence plundered, was riddled with holes, like a sea of bubbles.  The water droplets that had once filled the void were now noticeably sparse, revealing subtle energy fluctuations.</p><p>Qingluan's avatar's eyes flashed.  Its wings stirred, unleashing a burst of lightning. A bolt of azure thunder shot towards a point on the battlefield.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A giant surged from the water, roaring as it launched a devastating punch towards the sky.  The force was immense, seemingly capable of collapsing the void, but the fist met the lightning.  In a blinding flash, the giant's body froze, then exploded into pure spiritual energy.</p><p>Qingluan's avatar effortlessly absorbed the energy, but Min Zhuo remained unseen.</p><p>Qin Sang, unhurried and confident in her judgment, instantly detected a second similar energy signature and struck again.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Giants were constantly born and destroyed, each lasting only a moment before dissolving under the power of the lightning.  They posed no threat to Qingluan's avatar, instead serving as a source of energy.</p><p>Min Zhuo desperately hid, but the water droplets around him thinned further.</p><p>Qingluan's avatar's speed was unmatched; Min Zhuo had no respite.  As another giant was destroyed, his true form was finally exposed.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A bolt of azure thunder ripped through the void.</p><p>The water surface in front of him suddenly caved in, twisting as Min Zhuo was forced to reveal himself at the bottom of a watery pit, instantly sensing the impending danger.</p><p>Qingluan's avatar, having absorbed vast amounts of energy, unleashed an even more terrifying attack than before.  Min Zhuo struggled, his alms bowl reappearing to shield him, only to be struck by a powerful claw.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Min Zhuo's face paled as he recoiled.  The alms bowl, its light flickering, was sent flying towards the abyss – this time for good.</p><p>The azure lightning paused momentarily, then reappeared before Min Zhuo. The outline of Qingluan's avatar shimmered within the lightning, its wings erupting with even purer energy as it struck Min Zhuo with a powerful blow.</p><p>A deafening thunderclap echoed.</p><p>Min Zhuo was flung away, his armor shattering with a cry of pain.  He was a powerful cultivator, a clan leader, undoubtedly possessing further protective treasures. Qin Sang, not daring to underestimate him, gave him no chance to recover.</p><p>Lightning flashed as Qingluan's avatar pressed its attack. Min Zhuo could only defend weakly, his injuries mounting under the relentless assault.</p><p>Finally, Qingluan's avatar descended, its claw like a blade aimed at Min Zhuo's head.</p><p>Min Zhuo, still resisting, revealed a purple glow on his chest, seemingly about to unleash another treasure.</p><p>Suddenly, Min Zhuo stiffened, his life force rapidly fading. The purple glow flickered and died.</p><p>…</p><p>The Changyou Clan's ancestral hall.</p><p>Min Shu's face was filled with terror.</p><p>The flames engulfing the wax figure raged, melting wax spreading across the hall floor.</p><p>Finally, the wax figure burned to ash.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Min Shu cried out, trembling with fear. He couldn't imagine what the wax figure's destruction meant for his father and the Changyou Clan.</p><p>What had happened in the defiled land?</p><p>…</p><p>The ancient texts were not wrong. The burning of the wax figure had manifested his injuries anew.</p><p>A wave of debilitating weakness washed over Min Zhuo. His old injuries, doubled in severity, combined with his new wounds, leaving him almost powerless.  He had never felt so weak, not even after his tribulation.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the change in Min Zhuo, surprised by his sudden loss of fighting ability.  Unsure if it was a trick, she didn’t relent, only stopping when her claw pierced his skull, confirming his utter helplessness.</p><p>As Min Zhuo’s life hung in the balance, Qingluan’s avatar subtly reduced its force at the last moment, sparing him.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Several bolts of lightning materialized, transforming into thundering restraints that bound Min Zhuo's body.</p><p>The power of the lightning penetrated his very being, completely immobilizing him.</p><p>The aftermath of the battle faded, leaving only silence.</p><p>The outcome was clear!</p><p>Min Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, discovering he was still alive, a fact that didn't surprise him.  He was extremely weak, barely clinging to life.  Looking at the Qingluan Dharma form, he rasped, "My greatest mistake was making an enemy of the True Person."</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved.</p><p>At their level of cultivation, everyone held firm beliefs. Even given another chance, Min Zhuo wouldn't have changed his decision.</p><p>"Is there anything else you wish to say?" Qin Sang said indifferently.</p><p>Min Zhuo didn't plead for mercy. With difficulty, he turned his eyes towards Mount Taiyu, a hint of regret flashing in his eyes. He sighed, "If the True Person wishes to know about this mountain, I have nothing to hide, for I know very little myself. I only know that this mountain is an ancient immortal mountain of immense origin. As for how to claim this mountain, and what its unique features are, I know nothing!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. Min Zhuo was surprisingly candid, seeming sincere.</p><p>He could try soul-searching, but such techniques used on a Transcendence-level cultivator rarely yielded good results. Moreover, their cultivation levels were similar; at best, he'd only obtain fragmented memories, not necessarily what he wanted.</p><p>The subsequent interrogation yielded nothing more. Min Zhuo remained composed, revealing everything he'd learned from the texts and his own deductions.</p><p>Unfortunately, it didn't contain the information Qin Sang most desired: how to claim the mountain.</p><p>The previous wait outside, followed by the fight with Min Zhuo, had significantly delayed him. The tide was rising, leaving him little time.</p><p>After the interrogation, Qin Sang left Min Zhuo aside, intending to question him further later.</p><p>"Mount Taiyu, Yuanjiao Sea City…"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't anticipated Mount Taiyu's origins. Why had this ancient immortal mountain of the Great Thousand World fallen into the Storm Realm?</p><p>It further proved the Storm Realm's extraordinary nature!</p><p>Mount Taiyu's location was also significant, blocking the path to the Dao Marker Gate.</p><p>Besides the Purple Micro Palace, could the Storm Realm's peculiarities be connected to this mountain? The Yi Ren tribe's connection to the Storm Realm through the mountain suggested that the Storm Realm's ascension to the Mist Sea might not be a coincidence!</p><p>He flashed to Mount Taiyu, circling it.  Beyond the cracks and the stele, he found nothing unusual.  Like Min Zhuo, he was puzzled, unsure of the mountain's true wonders.</p><p>Of course, such a treasure should be his.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang approached the mountain, landing smoothly on the stone platform and walking to the stele.</p><p>This action didn't trigger any changes. Qin Sang raised a phoenix wing, gently placing it on the stele, and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>His consciousness seeped into the stele. After several attempts, he finally captured a trace of energy. It was like opening a door, as if he'd entered a vast, empty void.</p><p>Suddenly, the space trembled, and Qin Sang's consciousness was forced back. He opened his eyes, a glimmer of joy in them.  Though this attempt failed, it confirmed his suspicions – the stele held a secret!</p><p>Qin Sang gradually increased his exploration, slowly discovering patterns.  The space's tremors synchronized with the mountain. He could split his attention to observe the outside, preparing to prevent his consciousness from being ejected again.</p><p>As Qin Sang's exploration deepened, he noticed new changes. The tremors became more frequent and intense.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Mount Taiyu violently shook.  Green light erupted from the cracks, each tremor releasing dozens of green spiritual energies.</p><p>The Chang You tribe experts outside rejoiced.  Usually, the green spiritual energy lessened over time. This was a massive surge, already exceeding twice the previous amount.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace experts' eyes almost bled.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the outside world, plunging almost all his consciousness into the stele's space.</p><p>Progress became increasingly difficult. He felt he was nearing the end, yet the space remained empty.  In reality, this was Qin Sang's own perception, imagining it as an unknown space; the space might not be truly existent.</p><p>Beyond that, he couldn't describe its nature. It might be an unprecedented power hidden within the stele.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was subjected to incredibly powerful shocks, as if resisting an invisible will that was trying to expel him.</p><p>Did Mount Taiyu possess a will?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure; it was merely his perception. He had never detected a single trace of actual consciousness.</p><p>After countless shocks, Qin Sang finally reached the end of the stele's space.</p><p>The tremors hadn't stopped, but Qin Sang had a new sensation.</p><p>Through the stele, he sensed the entire mountain!</p><p>The mountain's contours, its ancient prohibitions, its subtle energies, even every stone, every cliff face – all were vividly etched in his mind!</p><p>Before, Mount Taiyu had been inaccessible. Now, he held a key, and could attempt something.</p>
