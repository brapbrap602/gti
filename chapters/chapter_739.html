<h1>Chapter 731: Swordsmanship Stuns the Enemy</h1><p>Qin Sang didn't bother with lengthy arguments; his goal had been achieved.  </p><p>He'd come alone.  If he'd directly stated his intention to oust Cui Ji, he feared Cui Ji, with years of influence and possibly bribed merchant guilds, would launch a counterattack.</p><p>Using a personal vendetta as a pretext made outside interference less likely.</p><p>Confronting Cui Ji directly was simpler.</p><p>“Cui, there’s no point in beating around the bush. You know my purpose. Today, we settle this. The winner stays; the loser leaves Wuyuan Island with his people and never sets foot here again.”</p><p>Qin Sang moved his lips slightly, transmitting his words to Cui Ji.</p><p>Cui Ji’s face paled and flushed. He couldn’t fathom Qin Sang's true strength.  His aura clearly indicated early Foundation Establishment stage, yet he'd easily captured his men, intimidating everyone present.</p><p>He glanced around, realizing his men were unreliable.</p><p>With his top subordinate captured and his leverage compromised, consolidating the power of the Jiuxing Guild to forcefully subdue the Qiongyu Merchant Guild was impossible.</p><p>His only option seemed to be accepting this wild Taoist's proposal.</p><p>Cui Ji remained silent, turning and entering the hall with a wave of his sleeve.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Wang sisters to keep an eye on the man, then calmly walked inside, nodding kindly to the onlookers as he passed through the crowd, receiving several nods in return.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The door slammed shut.</p><p>Everyone guessed what was about to happen and lingered outside, unwilling to disperse.</p><p>Inside the hall, Qin Sang and Cui Ji faced each other.  Qin Sang held the Ten Directions Yama Banner, the formation already set.  He then flicked his wrist, and the Flying Night Rakshasa silently appeared behind him.</p><p>“Flying Night Rakshasa!”</p><p>Cui Ji’s eyes narrowed, suddenly understanding. “The demonic cultivator possesses a Foundation Establishment-level corpse puppet!  I never expected Elder Zou to value Wuyuan Island so highly.  I misjudged Cui.”</p><p>“Since you know you misjudged, then consider it your misfortune.”</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Cui Ji sneered, “Who wins is yet to be seen. Demonic cultivator, you’re far too arrogant!”</p><p>Before his words finished, Cui Ji raised the hand hidden behind his back.  Purple light surged from his palm, and a lychee-sized, perfectly round orb shone brightly.</p><p>“Demonic cultivator, taste the power of my Purple Nether Pearl!”</p><p>Cui Ji roared, the pearl's purple light intensifying.  In an instant, several purple rays shot out, swiftly piercing the air toward Qin Sang.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa vanished from behind Qin Sang.</p><p>The next moment, a chorus of ghostly howls echoed through the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways. The Flying Night Rakshasa was entangled by the purple rays, which resembled tough, flexible cords.  Despite the Rakshasa’s powerful blows, they didn't break, only slightly splitting.</p><p>Cui Ji lightly tapped his finger, sending more purple rays to ensnare the Rakshasa further.</p><p>It seemed the Rakshasa would struggle to break free and reach Cui Ji anytime soon.</p><p>Qin Sang showed no anxiety. He flicked his sleeves, and three Ten Directions Yama Banners slowly flew out, forming a large array in front of him, revealing the aura of a powerful artifact.</p><p>“A mid-grade artifact!”</p><p>Cui Ji's face changed drastically, exclaiming in disbelief.</p><p>His heart pounding, he repeatedly tapped his fingers, making the Purple Nether Pearl spin rapidly, spewing forth more purple rays in a torrential downpour.  Despite being distracted by the Rakshasa, its power was still immense.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the purple rays, focusing his true energy into the Ten Directions Yama Banners.  With a whoosh, the Nine Nether Demon Fire surged forth, gathering into a ball in the center of the flag array.  At Qin Sang’s command, it counterattacked.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The hall trembled violently.</p><p>The purple rays clashed with the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>In an instant, the hall's furnishings were either shattered or incinerated by the strange flames; the entire hall seemed on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Cui Ji's eyes widened, shocked by the Nine Nether Demon Fire's power.</p><p>Sensing the aura of the demonic fire, a wave of fear washed over him. He knew he couldn't let it near him.  Cui Ji gave Qin Sang a strange look, regretting he hadn’t realized the Qiongyu Merchant Guild's envoy was so formidable.</p><p>“How could that old geezer send this guy here?”</p><p>Cui Ji cursed inwardly, gritting his teeth.  Suddenly, he used his true energy to cut his finger, forcing out a drop of blood onto the Purple Nether Pearl.</p><p>He didn't hesitate to use his lifeblood to power the magical artifact, aiming for a swift victory.</p><p>Fueled by the lifeblood, the Zi Xia dramatically increased in size and power, surging past the Nine Nether Demon Fire and heading straight for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and he instantly retreated, but the Nine Nether Demon Fire remained in place.</p><p>'Swish swish swish...'</p><p>The Zi Xia struck the ground, easily creating large craters—its power was astonishing.</p><p>Qin Sang's clumsy evasive maneuvers made him appear extremely vulnerable.</p><p>Cui Ji rejoiced at this sight, about to further activate the Zi You Pearl, when he caught a glimpse of a dark shadow. The Nine Nether Demon Fire seized the opportunity to attack.</p><p>Cui Ji thought the fire was targeting him and quickly dodged.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Nine Nether Demon Fire changed course mid-air and lunged towards the Zi You Pearl.</p><p>Cui Ji was stunned. He knew the fire was unpredictable, but destroying the Zi You Pearl was like a fool's dream. It was his life-bound artifact, meticulously refined over many years. Its power was unparalleled, nearing the level of a mid-grade artifact, almost comparable to the Ten Directions Yama Formation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>As the Nine Nether Demon Fire neared the Zi You Pearl, a flash of red light appeared, strikingly unusual.</p><p>Before Cui Ji could discern what the red light was, he felt his life-bound artifact become sluggish.  The Zi You Pearl, for some reason, seemed to lose its spiritual essence and faltered.</p><p>Qin Sang had cleverly concealed his ebony sword within the Nine Nether Demon Fire, waiting to contaminate the Zi You Pearl.</p><p>The previously formidable Zi Xia instantly dissipated.</p><p>Cui Ji was terrified. While the loss of his life-bound artifact was concerning, losing it placed him in mortal danger.</p><p>Fortunately, his cultivation was high, preventing him from panicking.</p><p>He hurriedly patted his storage pouch, summoning a silver circular shield. The shield shone brightly, barely blocking the Nine Nether Demon Fire. Simultaneously, he sensed a fierce wind from his left, realizing the Flying Night Rakshasa had escaped.  He quickly tapped the shield.</p><p>The shield subtly shifted, splitting into two, blocking the Rakshasa's claws.</p><p>He didn't expect the shield to last long. His spiritual energy wasn't heavily depleted; he just needed time to regain his footing, then the battle would still be winnable.</p><p>But Qin Sang wouldn't give him that chance.</p><p>A series of thunderous sounds echoed, and a sword beam suddenly flashed before Cui Ji. The beam split into two, left and right, indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>"Sword Qi Thunder Sound! Sword Light Divergence!"</p><p>Cui Ji was shocked, feeling a sharp pain in his throat.</p><p>At that moment, he realized he had been outmaneuvered, that a comeback was virtually impossible, and his life was in danger. He couldn't gamble any longer and shouted, "I yield!"</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The sword beam slid past him.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, reluctantly sheathing his sword.</p><p>(Disturbed by the news from Henan, I've been off all day.</p><p>If only we had the powers of immortals... sigh.</p><p>May the heavy rain stop soon! May everyone be safe!)</p>
