<h1>Chapter 394: Blood to Feed the Ghosts</h1><p>The Five Elements Sword Mantra is specifically designed to break restrictions.</p><p>Gu Tiannan, being only at the Qi Refining stage, had limited access to spiritual materials.  The Five Elements Spirit Swords he refined to complement the mantra were of low quality, and Qin Sang rarely used them later.</p><p>Qin Sang had fully mastered the mantra. He later collected more spiritual materials and had someone refine the Five Elements Spirit Swords again, raising their quality to a higher level.</p><p>He had found the key to breaking the restriction.</p><p>The spirit swords flew forward together, transforming into a rainbow and piercing the barrier.</p><p>Spiritual light shimmered on the barrier, rippling like water, illuminating the entire chamber in a kaleidoscope of colors.</p><p>Putting Yu Hua out of his mind, Qin Sang focused intently on the restriction, not daring to miss any changes.  He had to manipulate the Five Elements Swords with extreme precision, borrowing the power of the five elements to break through the intricate layers of the restriction. Only then could he succeed.</p><p>Even so, it took Qin Sang a full thirty breaths to open the barrier.</p><p>Fortunately, Yu Hua hadn't managed to trap the Flying Night Devil yet.</p><p>Breaking the restriction might not have involved intense combat on the surface, but the mental strain was no less than the previous battle. One wrong step could trigger the restriction's backlash, ruining all his efforts.</p><p>Exhausted both physically and mentally, Qin Sang wiped the sweat from his forehead, his face unusually pale. He turned to glance outside.</p><p>The battle outside was fierce. Yu Hua was struggling to focus on breaking the restriction while entangled with the Flying Night Devil. This restriction should buy him some more time.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang took a step forward, gazing into the impenetrable darkness ahead.</p><p>The path forward was unknown, and he didn't know what he would face.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer had been secretive about it, saying the path ahead was extremely dangerous, even he wasn't confident.  He had advised Qin Sang to leave directly to avoid being implicated.</p><p>But with his Silver Dagger Talisman, Black Dragon Stone, Soul Binding Rope, and Living Corpse all destroyed, and himself utterly exhausted, Qin Sang faced a near-certain death. He could no longer heed Cloud Wanderer's warning.</p><p>Even if it was a life-or-death situation, it was better than his current predicament.</p><p>Chaos offered the only sliver of hope in this impossible situation!</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang's expression hardened. He summoned his Ebony Sword for defense and stepped into the darkness.</p><p>The next moment, the world spun.</p><p>This feeling was very familiar.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Hidden in the darkness was a teleportation formation! As his vision cleared, he found himself in another empty ice hall.</p><p>Unlike the outer ice hall, this one clearly showed signs of artificial excavation.</p><p>The perfectly square ice hall had been carved out with swords.</p><p>Behind him was the same darkness, while the opposite ice wall shimmered with a strange light. Qin Sang recognized at a glance that these restrictions were reinforcing the ice wall, and seemed primarily outward-facing.</p><p>Quickly surveying the ice hall, Qin Sang was surprised by the silence. There was none of the expected danger. He flashed across the hall to the ice wall.</p><p>The ice wall was somewhat transparent, allowing him to see the environment outside.</p><p>Beyond the wall, a hurricane whipped up endless snow and ice, constantly battering the wall. His vision was filled with white.</p><p>Besides this, there seemed to be no obvious danger, no ancient beasts in sight.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced.  Instead of breaking the ice wall's restriction, he continued forward and sat down cross-legged against the wall. He summoned the Ten Yama Banners and retrieved something from his Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>It was the Ten Yama Banners treasure he had obtained from Sun De!</p><p>Not only Yu Hua possessed treasures; he did too!</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the enormous banners and probed them with his divine sense. As expected, the treasure didn't react.</p><p>"It seems I need to set up the formation first."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.  Checking his internal injuries, which had improved somewhat, he waved his hand and deployed the Ten Yama Formation in front of him.</p><p>"Come out!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, his voice resonating with Yin energy. Ten main souls emerged from the ghost banners.</p><p>Even now, Qin Sang couldn't sense any connection between the main souls and the treasure.</p><p>Does it need blood...?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled every detail he had witnessed at the secluded pool. He knew the Demonic Sect had many similar blood refinement techniques. He just didn't know if feeding the ghosts with blood was enough, or if a secret method was required.</p><p>If a secret method was necessary, he would have to give up on using the treasure, open the restriction, and continue to flee.</p><p>Success or failure depended on this!</p><p>Spiritual power formed a small knife, cutting Qin Sang's fingertip.</p><p>He forced out a small amount of blood, dividing it into ten drops, and sent them flying towards the ten main souls.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's blood, the main souls, like hungry chicks, eagerly opened their mouths and swallowed the blood drops.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly see his blood flowing into the main souls' bodies, their forms now emitting a faint bloody glow.</p><p>He tried to activate the treasure, but it still didn't respond.</p><p>It seems it's not enough!</p><p>Qin Sang thought.</p><p>At the secluded pool, the main souls under Yu Hua's command had been almost entirely covered in blood threads, their bloody glow far more intense. They had only barely managed to lift the treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang gritted his teeth and, ignoring his weakness, forced out most of his blood, feeding it to the main souls.</p><p>"Roar! Roar!"</p><p>The main souls roared with excitement as blood threads spread across their bodies, the bloody glow intensifying.</p><p>Qin Sang's already pale skin became almost transparent, but an expression of immense joy appeared on his face.</p><p>At this moment, he finally felt a response from the treasure!</p><p>It worked!</p><p>Overjoyed, Qin Sang glanced at the treasure, then abruptly threw it forward. He forced the excited main souls to gather and lift the treasure together.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>An overwhelmingly powerful aura erupted from the treasure, making him tremble.</p><p>The ten main souls struggled to lift the treasure, roaring with effort, but they managed to withstand the pressure and hold on.</p><p>Qin Sang stuffed a handful of spirit pills into his mouth and quickly immersed his mind in the treasure.</p><p>To his surprise, the treasure didn't contain the countless souls he had imagined. Instead, it was filled with an endless sea of Nine Nether Demonic Flames, obscuring everything else.</p><p>Perhaps his cultivation was too low to perceive the treasure's true form.</p><p>The thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  Time was of the essence. He didn't delve deeper. Being able to control the Nine Nether Demonic Flames was enough!</p><p>With his mind connected to the treasure, Qin Sang willed it, and a vortex appeared on the banners. Nine Nether Demonic Flames emerged from the vortex, gathering into a stream and swirling around him.</p><p>The power of the Nine Nether Demonic Flames was terrifying. Qin Sang had no doubt that he would be incinerated if not for the treasure's restraint.</p><p>But now, the flames were obedient, allowing him to control them.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang realized the treasure's consumption was terrifying, like a bottomless pit, constantly devouring his spiritual power. Fortunately, his injuries had partially recovered, and the spirit pills he had taken beforehand allowed him to barely maintain it.</p><p>However, this wasn't a bad thing.</p><p>It meant Yu Hua couldn't control the treasure for long either!</p>
