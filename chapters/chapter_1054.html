<h1>Chapter 1466: Earthblood Ginseng</h1><p>“Form a defensive circle and protect me.”</p><p>Venerable Ye sat cross-legged on the ground, ordering his four disciples to guard him.</p><p>Although he was protected by an aura of light while disabling the altar's restrictions, he was still greatly affected by the mystic realm's suppression.  This drained him considerably and aggravated his injuries.</p><p>The inner sanctum held unpredictable dangers, so he needed to recover before venturing further.</p><p>“No chance.”</p><p>Qin Sang, hidden in the forest, observed this scene and shook his head.  These old cultivators were extremely cautious, making it difficult to find an opportunity to strike.</p><p>The elder with the long beard and the other two could easily block the first surprise attack.</p><p>He had no way to contact Su Nu to coordinate an assault.</p><p>Moreover, since Su Nu was no longer in mortal danger, there was no need for her to risk her life against a Nascent Soul Grandmaster.</p><p>After meditating for a while, Venerable Ye rose and departed with his disciples.</p><p>From beginning to end, he showed no intention of harming Su Nu. Qin Sang had waited until the very last moment, fulfilling his agreement with her.</p><p>“I wonder what this Ghost Seal is for. I'll return it to her when I have the chance.”</p><p>Qin Sang flipped the Ghost Seal in his hand and muttered to himself.</p><p>Earlier, Su Nu had been pessimistic, even despairing, and hadn't made any arrangements with Qin Sang for the seal's return.  Qin Sang had been more than patient, waiting this long.  He'd already wasted a lot of time and couldn't possibly search for her everywhere.</p><p>After Venerable Ye and his disciples had left, Qin Sang emerged from his hiding place and quietly appeared on the hilltop.</p><p>He tried several times, but couldn't force the divine platform to appear.</p><p>Clearly, there were still unknown secrets hidden within.</p><p>Whatever the Eastern Extremity Alliance was planning had nothing to do with him.  After a brief pause, Qin Sang put the matter aside and flew towards the Stone Peak. It was time to leave the Trial Grounds.</p><p>Stone Peak.</p><p>The Treasure Pavilion stood tall, its treasures already plundered. Passing through the light curtain would instantly transport one out.</p><p>A flash of light appeared before his eyes.</p><p>Immediately followed by a gust of chilling wind.</p><p>Su Nu and the others shivered, looking around to find themselves outside the Trial Grounds, standing on a barren hillside.</p><p>The world was dim and gloomy, filled with ruins, nothing like the immortal paradise they had imagined.</p><p>“This is the Inner Sanctum.”</p><p>Venerable Ye said calmly, gesturing towards the distance. “Those who enter through the Trial Grounds will be transported to these nearby hills. See that over there? If you don't wish to remain in the Inner Sanctum, the exit is there.”</p><p>Following Venerable Ye's direction, they saw a deep valley, sheer cliffs, a high platform, and an open stone gate atop it.</p><p>This was the gate through which Grandmasters like Ling Zhuzi had entered.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Venerable Ye glanced around, then flew towards the depths of the Inner Sanctum on his flying light. Su Nu and the others quickly followed.</p><p>Soon, Venerable Ye entered a stone mountain.</p><p>Just as he landed, a figure emerged from the shadows.</p><p>Su Nu and the others were startled at first, but then recognized the newcomer's face. Their expressions changed drastically, and they hurried forward to bow. “Greetings, Alliance Leader!”</p><p>The figure was the leader of the Eastern Extremity Alliance. After helping Venerable Ye bypass the immortal prohibition, he had been waiting here.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Ye?”</p><p>The Alliance Leader's eyes held a hint of urgency as he looked inquiringly at Venerable Ye.</p><p>“Everything went smoothly. I have completed my mission!”</p><p>Venerable Ye nodded in reply, making no mention of his setback in the Bewildering Caves.</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>The Alliance Leader clapped his hands and laughed. “You've worked hard, Fellow Daoist Ye. If I hadn't already used my chance to participate in the trials, I would have gone in myself and not let you take such a risk.  How are your injuries? Shall I have someone escort you back to recuperate?”</p><p>The Alliance Leader's face was filled with concern.</p><p>Venerable Ye shook his head. “I’ve already taken healing pills.  After a brief period of meditation, I should recover some of my strength and be able to retrieve that item… I must thank you, Alliance Leader, for the information you provided.”</p><p>The Alliance Leader didn't press the matter further. His gaze shifted to Su Nu and the others.  "Only the four of you?"</p><p>Venerable Ye praised them. “They performed admirably. Their contributions were crucial to our success.  By the way, here is the Soul Cleansing Liquid…”</p><p>Venerable Ye took out the Soul Cleansing Liquid and handed it to the Alliance Leader.</p><p>The Alliance Leader grunted in acknowledgement. “Good.  There are several suitable locations within the Inner Sanctum for you to explore.  The extent of your harvest depends on your own abilities. The Alliance will reward you handsomely upon your return!”</p><p>With that, the Alliance Leader tossed them a jade slip.</p><p>The elder with the long beard and the others were overjoyed, their frustration over the loss of the Soul Cleansing Liquid lessening considerably.</p><p>At that moment, the Alliance Leader suddenly turned to Su Nu and said calmly, “Su Nu, stay behind. The rest of you may proceed.”</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>The elder with the long beard and the others exchanged puzzled glances with Su Nu, but dared not ask any questions.  They accepted the jade slip and departed together.</p><p>Venerable Ye also remained silent, bowing to the Alliance Leader before drifting away.</p><p>Su Nu, bewildered and apprehensive, felt a sudden surge of tension.</p><p>She had assumed that once they left the Trial Grounds, the matter would be over.  She hadn't expected the Alliance Leader to keep her behind.</p><p>The Alliance Leader produced another jade bottle containing a snow-white pill and handed it to Su Nu, his tone不容置疑道：“Go refine the Soul Cleansing Liquid and this pill. I will personally protect you.”</p><p>…</p><p>Trial Grounds.</p><p>Sea of Fire.</p><p>Beneath the yellow sand, magma flowed freely, forming underground caverns where fire spirits frolicked. Occasionally, they would leap out of the magma and burrow into the earth's crust.</p><p>Each time, this caused the magma to boil and red-hot air to surge skyward.</p><p>In one of these hidden caverns sat Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>Ignoring the intense heat, Ning Wu Hui had set up a complex altar. Before him floated a fist-sized ginseng root.</p><p>Beams of light emanated from the altar, merging with runes inscribed with Ning Wu Hui's blood essence, and continuously flowed into the ginseng.</p><p>The ginseng had distinct facial features. Its body was as clear as blood-colored glass.  Bound by the altar, runes flickered on its surface, its face contorted in an expression of pain, like a living infant.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui hadn't competed for the Soul Cleansing Liquid; instead, he had come to the Sea of Fire to harvest this ginseng.</p><p>He had been here for an unknown amount of time.</p><p>The ginseng's refinement by the altar was nearing completion.</p><p>Gradually, the ginseng's aura and Ning Wu Hui's became as one, its expression turning vacant.</p><p>“The secret technique described in the ancient texts is correct.  Using the Earthblood Ginseng, one can refine something akin to an External Nascent Soul! This Earthblood Ginseng is full of vital essence and emits a wondrous fragrance. Once mature, it becomes animated, moving freely around its growing area, elusive and hard to capture. Fortunately, it grew in the Sea of Fire, where the fire spirit energy masked its fragrance, and its vital essence blended with the red-hot fire, giving it a strange color.  That Heavenly Dao Sect predecessor mistook it for a peculiar fire spirit, otherwise it would have been harvested long ago. I must thank that predecessor for recording this as a strange tale...”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui was exhausted, but his expression was filled with joy.  He brushed his palm over his crown.</p><p>His Nascent Soul merged with the Earthblood Ginseng, which instantly became animated and transformed into a streak of blood-colored light, disappearing into his body.</p><p>Collecting his belongings, Ning Wu Hui flew out of the ground and towards the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Something came up today, so I owe you a chapter. I'll make it up later.</p>
