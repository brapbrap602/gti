<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1284: Slaying Within the Formation</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The demonesses had just appeared, barely able to act, when they were engulfed in a sea of flames.  </p><p>Scorched by the demonic fire, the demonesses writhed in agony, their screams piercing the air.  </p><p>They struggled desperately within the inferno, but the power of the demonic fire was too much to bear. Their auras withered, and their plight was pitiful. In mere moments, they fled back into the Flower Fan amidst their cries of pain.  </p><p>Then, the demonic fire surged violently toward the treasure!  </p><p>The Flower Fan was an exotic treasure, never meant for defense. When struck by the demonic fire, its radiance dimmed abruptly, and it let out a mournful cry. Suffering significant damage, it was sent flying away.  </p><p>The treasure was connected to Moon Scatterer's mind and spirit. Having endured consecutive heavy blows, Moon Scatterer felt as if struck by lightning. A sweet taste rose in his throat, and he spat out a mouthful of blood, his face turning deathly pale.  </p><p>He couldn’t even withstand a single strike from the demonic fire!  </p><p>Moon Scatterer’s face was filled with terror as he frantically tried to flee.  </p><p>Unexpectedly, the demonic fire suddenly reversed course, retracting back into Qin Sang’s control. Immediately after, a dazzling point of light shot out from the flames, moving with extreme speed. In the blink of an eye, it was upon him—it was the Ebony Sword.  </p><p>Qin Sang had made such a great sacrifice with the sole purpose of utterly annihilating this man. If his Nascent Soul were to escape, all his efforts would have been in vain.  </p><p>To destroy a Nascent Soul, however, required the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation.  </p><p>At this moment, Moon Scatterer had no time to recover the Flower Fan. In his panic, he hastily slapped his storage pouch, and a streak of azure light shot out—a shapeless mass of crimson cloud energy.  </p><p>This was Moon Scatterer’s go-to defensive treasure, known as the Crimson Cloud Barrier.  </p><p>The Crimson Cloud Barrier rapidly expanded, forming a curtain of cloud to shield his retreat.  </p><p>Moon Scatterer didn’t even look back, focusing solely on escaping.  </p><p>This was undoubtedly the greatest crisis he had ever faced. Knowing he was no match for Qin Sang, he could only buy as much time as possible, hoping that the woman in purple would notice the disturbance and activate the grand formation to save him.  </p><p>*Swish!*  </p><p>The Ebony Sword arrived in a flash. Facing the cloud curtain, it didn’t hesitate. With a flick of its blade, it sprayed a bloody light that splattered across the cloud barrier.  </p><p>Corrupted by the filth, the Crimson Cloud Barrier’s radiance dimmed, and its power was greatly diminished.  </p><p>With the treasure damaged, the cloud curtain dissipated, unable to hold its form.  </p><p>The Ebony Sword showed no mercy, piercing straight through the cloud barrier and catching up to Moon Scatterer in an instant.  </p><p>Moon Scatterer tried to summon another treasure, but suddenly, the surroundings turned dark. He inwardly cursed, realizing he had already fallen into the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation!  </p><p>*Whoosh…*  </p><p>The Ebony Sword vanished, and the sword formation transformed into countless threads of sword energy, slicing toward Moon Scatterer!  </p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t fully mastered the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, so its power was somewhat lacking against formidable foes like Old Demon Ye. But against someone like Moon Scatterer, the formation’s might was more than enough to strike terror into his heart!  </p><p>The battle between the two unfolded at an astonishing speed.  </p><p>In a dizzying series of events, Moon Scatterer first lost the Flower Fan, then the Crimson Cloud Barrier.  </p><p>The woman in purple, who was overseeing the grand formation, finally noticed the situation. Caught off guard, she had no time to act before Moon Scatterer found himself in mortal danger.  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>A thunderous roar echoed as massive waves rose from all directions, crashing down on Qin Sang with terrifying force.  </p><p>Qin Sang paid no heed, focusing entirely on controlling the sword formation.  </p><p>Within the formation, Moon Scatterer’s screams echoed incessantly.  </p><p>At that moment, a gray hurricane suddenly appeared above the battlefield. The hurricane descended, and within it, the faint silhouette of a tower could be seen. Though it seemed to move slowly, it was in fact incredibly swift, forming a thick wall of wind that, at the critical moment, suppressed the massive waves for Qin Sang.  </p><p>This was part of the plan. While overseeing the grand formation, Qingjun had been keeping a close eye on Qin Sang’s movements, ready to intervene at the right moment to shield him from external interference.  </p><p>Moreover, she integrated the pressure of the Gale Formation into the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, aiding Qin Sang in suppressing Moon Scatterer and swiftly ending the battle.  </p><p>This move completely dashed Moon Scatterer’s hopes of survival!  </p><p>*Thud!*  </p><p>A thread of sword energy flashed by.  </p><p>Moon Scatterer’s left arm was severed at the shoulder, and his body was riddled with wounds, drenched in blood—a pitiful sight.  </p><p>In his final moments, Moon Scatterer made one last desperate attempt. With a roar, he lunged forward, hurling a dozen thunder pearls crafted from lustful poison. Breaking free from the formation’s pressure, he caused the sword formation to tremble. He allowed the formation to shred his physical body, and his Nascent Soul flew out from the crown of his head. Glancing around in confusion, he locked onto a direction and prepared to teleport away.  </p><p>However, the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation suddenly flared with a ghostly light, and a peculiar wave of energy struck him.  </p><p>Moon Scatterer’s Nascent Soul was momentarily disoriented, missing its chance. When it regained clarity, it was horrified to find a flying sword hovering before it, its sword energy razor-sharp!  </p><p>“No!”  </p><p>Boundless fear filled Moon Scatterer’s eyes as his scream was abruptly cut short.  </p><p>The Ebony Sword pierced through his Nascent Soul, shattering it on the spot!  </p><p>Qin Sang showed no mercy, slaying Moon Scatterer!  </p><p>The sword formation retracted, and the ghostly light dissipated. Moon Scatterer was utterly erased from existence. Qin Sang reached out, collecting Moon Scatterer’s storage pouch and treasures.  </p><p>This was the second Nascent Soul from the Sin Abyss he had slain within a formation!  </p><p>On Twin Mirror Mountain, the woman in purple overseeing the grand formation was filled with shock and fury, her eyes blazing. They had never anticipated that Qin Sang possessed such a brilliant disguise technique, impersonating Lady Luo to set a trap.  </p><p>Moon Scatterer was also a fool, nearly killed in a single exchange, unable to put up any resistance. His Nascent Soul didn’t even have a chance to escape, and she had no time to rescue him.  </p><p>Since Qin Sang’s sudden rise, including Old Demon Ye’s Blood Demon avatar, three Nascent Souls from the Sin Abyss had fallen by his hand—all utterly annihilated, their Nascent Souls destroyed as well. The losses were undeniably severe.  </p><p>Looking down the mountain, Lady Luo, who had been assisting Qingjun, had also reverted to her true form. She smiled coyly, her gaze provocatively fixed on the mountain peak.  </p><p>Lady Luo was naturally delighted.  </p><p>This plan had succeeded, and the slaying of a Sin Abyss Nascent Soul was undoubtedly due to Qin Sang’s astonishing strength, but her contribution couldn’t be overlooked. Moreover, the one who died was Moon Scatterer, whom she despised the most—a double victory.  </p><p>The battle had just begun, and already a Nascent Soul had fallen. The Sin Abyss side was greatly shaken, and the other Nascent Souls all showed signs of unease.  </p><p>The woman in purple sent a message summoning others to take over the grand formation, then personally entered the formation.  </p><p>Qin Sang stored Moon Scatterer’s storage pouch and swept it with his divine sense. The Sin Abyss had invaded the Heavenly Alliance for years, plundering extensively, and Moon Scatterer had amassed a considerable fortune.  </p><p>He glanced through it briefly but found no extraordinary treasures—just some ordinary items.  </p><p>Then, a cold snort reached his ears. In the distance, the water rippled, and a figure emerged—it was the woman in purple.  </p><p>Seeing her, Qin Sang’s pupils contracted slightly. He quickly stored the storage pouch and flicked his sleeve, releasing the eighteen demon banners once more. Demonic fire swirled around him.  </p><p>This woman was actually a mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator!  </p><p>Her aura seemed slightly stronger than even Dongyang Bo’s.  </p><p>“Immortal Qiu Zhi!”  </p><p>Qin Sang’s mind raced, recalling her identity.  </p><p>She had originally come from a subordinate sect of the Starry Sky Sect, a sect that had been forcibly subjugated by the Starry Sky Sect. Blessed with extraordinary talent, she had declared her independence from the Starry Sky Sect shortly after forming her Nascent Soul.  </p><p>The Heavenly Elder had once sought to suppress her, but not only did she refuse to yield, she withstood the pressure and broke through to the mid-stage Nascent Soul realm. The Heavenly Elder had no choice but to accept a truce.  </p><p>Seeing that it was Immortal Qiu Zhi who had come for him, Qin Sang remained on high alert.</p>
