<h1>Chapter 1742: The Dragon Transformation Pool</h1><p>The method to refine the Qilin Primordial Seed would be of immeasurable benefit.  Qin Sang understood, even without Zhu Que’s reminder, that the essence of an ancient powerful being wasn’t easily obtained; it must have protective measures.  Even if he could locate the Qilin Primordial Seed, it wouldn't be something a mere Nascent Soul cultivator like him could break. To be blinded by treasure would be to invite death.</p><p>Qin Sang’s only current curiosity was the location of the Qilin’s essence. He most hoped that the Qilin essence, like the Qilin Primordial Seed, had fallen to this world. This world lacked cultivators above the Nascent Soul stage, so regardless of how long the Qilin essence slumbered, there was no need to worry about others getting there first. Once his cultivation was high enough, he might even have the ability to break through realms and then obtain the treasure.</p><p>For now, such thoughts were premature. Qin Sang dismissed distracting thoughts, following Zhu Que’s guidance to focus his senses on the Qilin Primordial Seed.  To Qin Sang, it appeared as an unremarkable, transparent lotus seed. No matter how many times his spiritual sense scanned it, he detected nothing unusual.</p><p>Following Zhu Que’s instructions, Qin Sang moved his spiritual sense and sensed a slight difference within the seed. While Zhu Que had made it sound easy, perhaps due to their differing races, Qin Sang found the secret technique extremely difficult. He dared not relax, carefully and meticulously penetrating the Qilin Primordial Seed layer by layer, until he sensed a strange energy within the seed’s heart.</p><p>According to Zhu Que, this energy was the essence of the Qilin Primordial Seed, but Qin Sang still couldn't sense any spiritual fluctuation. This was the mysterious aspect of the ancient beast’s methods. When the Qilin Primordial Seed was dormant, it was like it was truly dead, undetectable even by someone cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique, even as it began to revive within their body.</p><p>He could only vaguely sense it, unable to move the Qilin Primordial Seed’s essence.  It seemed likely that there were restrictions left by the Qilin before its death within the seed.  While Zhu Que might have easily taken it in its prime, even now, direct absorption was impossible.</p><p>Zhu Que's method was simple in theory: to use the opponent's method against them. Qin Sang still needed to use the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique to absorb the Qilin Primordial Seed into his body, suppressing the Qilin’s spirit and absorbing the essence while it was unconscious.  The actual execution, of course, wasn't so simple.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for several days, seeking instruction from Zhu Que repeatedly before daring to act. A fire lotus flew from his brow, suspended before him.  Simultaneously, a strand of spiritual sense guided the Qilin Primordial Seed, slowly flying towards the fire lotus, stopping about three inches above it.</p><p>He hadn't yet reached the peak of the second realm; the central petals of the fire lotus were tightly closed. Yet, a thin thread of fire lotus rose, wrapping around the Qilin Primordial Seed. Black flames spread, enveloping the seed.</p><p>The Solar God Tree stood beside Qin Sang; nine divine birds perched on its branches, watching with envious and resentful gazes.  Qin Sang's gaze remained locked on the Qilin Primordial Seed; his thoughts flickered, and his hand seals changed rapidly, flowing like water.</p><p>The flames on the seed rippled incessantly; then, the flames twisted, and fire talismans emerged, flashing before disappearing into the seed. Finally, the Qilin Primordial Seed suddenly shook, as if pulled downwards by the flame, and continued downward even after contacting the flower bud, falling into the lotus heart without hindrance!</p><p>Up to this point, the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique had been used to re-integrate the Qilin Primordial Seed into the fire lotus. What followed was the crucial step.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression darkened; his spiritual sense surged from his brow, causing an invisible ripple in the cabin. An immense and vast power appeared out of thin air, circling once before converging towards the fire lotus.</p><p>The flames blazed brightly!</p><p>The fire lotus swayed gently, its petals trembling. On the surface, it appeared calm.  Spiritual sense surged into the fire lotus like a tide, transforming into intangible spiritual imprints, continuously merging into the Qilin Primordial Seed.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Qin Sang began to sweat on his forehead, clearly finding it strenuous.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang finally let out a long sigh of relief. The fire lotus trembled before returning to normal.  The Solar God Birds all curled their beaks in disappointment. Zhu Que naturally hoped Qin Sang would fail, forcing him to seek help, thus giving Zhu Que a chance to demand a reward, but unfortunately, that didn't happen.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The fire lotus floated into Qin Sang’s palm.  Qin Sang didn’t rush to recover his breath, staring intently at the lotus heart, sensing an additional object within, yet seamlessly integrated with the fire lotus, showing no abnormalities.</p><p>Absorbing the essence of the primordial seed wouldn’t be accomplished overnight, but the smooth completion of this step gave Qin Sang immense confidence. The only drawback was the need to constantly maintain the secret technique with his spiritual sense.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, put away the Fire Lotus, and turned to the Sun God Tree.  "How do I give the Sky Phoenix Feather to you?" he asked.</p><p>With the Qilin Primordial Essence inside him, Qin Sang couldn't continue refining the spirit fire or cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*. However, once this was done, his progress would be significantly faster than normal cultivation.</p><p>In the meantime, he should fulfill his agreement and give the Sky Phoenix Feather to the Vermillion Bird, allowing it to comprehend it. Once the time was right, it could directly provide him with Phoenix True Fire.</p><p>The disheartened Vermillion Bird perked up at this. "It's simple," it chirped repeatedly. "Just send it into the tree, to where I am. You don't need to do anything else."</p><p>"What...?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, glancing at the divine bird nestled amongst the branches. "Won't that affect the Sun God Tree?"</p><p>The Sun God Tree remained his strongest asset, and he couldn't afford any mistakes.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird feather was placed beneath the tree trunk, suppressed by a green bronze block and a tortoise shell. It wasn't a spatial treasure; the small space was filled with raging Nanming Li Fire, barely maintaining balance.</p><p>If the Sky Phoenix Feather were added, a clash between the two true fires could destroy the Sun God Tree – a terrible loss.</p><p>"Don't worry," the Vermillion Bird said confidently, its tone eager. Qin Sang had promised to share the Phoenix True Fire with it. "Even though I can't control the true fire, I've learned to restrain it somewhat over the years. The feather is severely damaged, and its true fire has been dormant for many years.  As long as we don't overstimulate it, nothing will happen. And if I can't control it, you can always take it back."</p><p>Qin Sang was suspicious.  The young spirit's words were hard to trust.</p><p>He pressed for a thorough explanation.  Once satisfied with the Vermillion Bird's clear and confident answers, he nodded slightly, summoned the Sun God Tree, and took out the Sky Phoenix Feather.</p><p>With the Vermillion Bird's help, Qin Sang could sense the interior of the Sun God Tree, vastly different from when he first refined it.</p><p>He could barely find any traces of his own handiwork. Years of being scorched by the Nanming Li Fire had left it unrecognizable.</p><p>Only the green bronze block seemed unchanged. The mysterious white bronze, the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle shell, and the other spirit materials had been completely fused, their individual identities lost.</p><p>Nanming Li Fire constantly flowed within the Sun God Tree.  Once the Vermillion Bird regained its strength and no longer needed the tree to suppress its true fire, the tree, even if not a supreme treasure, would be an invaluable material.</p><p>"Qin Sang, I'm here."</p><p>A clear, childish voice reached Qin Sang's senses.</p><p>Despite its weakness, the young Vermillion Bird possessed the pride of its lineage. It didn't consider itself subordinate, believing that their alliance made them equals, so it addressed Qin Sang by name instead of using a respectful title.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mind.  All that mattered was its usefulness.</p><p>He sensed a feather within the Nanming Li Fire. A faint outline of a fiery bird, blurry but recognizable as the Vermillion Bird's weak projection, was visible on it.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a while, then instructed the Vermillion Bird, which followed his directions precisely.  The light in the cabin flickered.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang nodded and placed his other hand, along with the Sky Phoenix Feather, against the Sun God Tree, gently inserting the feather below the green bronze block, into the space where the Vermillion Bird's feather was located.</p><p>The Nanming Li Fire calmed slightly.</p><p>The Sky Phoenix Feather didn't sink into the flames but rested against the green bronze block. A subtle ripple indicated the Vermillion Bird extending its power.</p><p>Seeing the Sun God Tree unharmed, Qin Sang relaxed.</p><p>…</p><p>The spirit ship remained near the Jiao Long ancestral lands for a month.</p><p>During that month, all the Yao tribes with a say in decisions received messages from the Jiao Long King, summoning them for a meeting.</p><p>The various Yao Kings, intimidated by Qin Sang's power, dared not approach the ancestral lands. The Jiao Long King arranged accommodations for them in a water palace.</p><p>Qin Sang's transformed body meditated on the ship's bow, remaining within the cabin and not urging them.</p><p>Several days later, two Yao Kings who commanded the Jiao Long King's guard exchanged a look, seeming to receive an order.  A booming voice, like rolling thunder, echoed toward the spirit ship.</p><p>"We humbly request an audience with the True Monarch. Our King has a matter to discuss."</p><p>The transformed body opened its eyes. "Speak."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang's true form wasn't leaving the cabin, the two Yao Kings didn't dare speak further. They used magic to create a water mirror, revealing the Jiao Long King, with the Phoenix King standing beside him.</p><p>The Jiao Long King, knowing the true identity of the transformed body, didn't waste words. "True Monarch, will you take an oath first?"</p><p>The transformed body smiled. "It seems you've made a decision.  Taking an oath is no trouble.  Let's set up a karmic altar."</p><p>"The altar is already prepared!"</p><p>The Jiao Long King silently gave an instruction.</p><p>Soon, waves surged before the magical vessel. Several Jiao dragons emerged from the water, each carrying a massive golden platform a hundred zhang long and wide.</p><p>Hua Shen observed for a moment, nodded slightly, and awakened his true form.</p><p>Qin Sang's true form emerged from meditation and gracefully ascended the altar.  Seeing the meticulously prepared oaths, row upon row, he smiled faintly, unperturbed.  Before everyone, he solemnly swore an oath of cause and effect.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King and the Phoenix King watched through a water mirror. Only after Qin Sang completed his oath did their expressions soften.</p><p>Worthy of leading his people, the Jiao Dragon King then left his ancestral land and boarded the magical vessel.</p><p>Seeing this king, whose bearing surpassed even his predecessor, Qin Sang praised, "Friend, you possess great courage."</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King bowed, his voice resounding, "Since the True Lord cannot ascend, we cannot remain hidden in our ancestral land.  We believe the True Lord would not deceive us and break the oath.  From now on, our tribe will fully commit to finding the Ascension Platform.  We will not hide any other discoveries from the True Lord."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded happily. "Your willingness to resolve conflict and work together to find a way out for the cultivators of this realm fills me with comfort. I will now proceed to the Witch God Mountain. The Witch tribe will also restrain their actions, as will the human race."</p><p>The two discussed the details further.</p><p>Although only the Jiao Dragon King appeared, the other demon kings were watching from afar. Qin Sang was essentially negotiating with the entire demon sea's demon tribes.</p><p>Qin Sang made no excessive demands; the subsequent negotiations went smoothly.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang smiled. "The Jiao Dragon race possesses exceptionally strong bodies, far surpassing other races. I hear that your ancestral land holds a secret place that remarkably enhances physical strength. Is this true?"</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King's face instantly changed, his gaze deep. "What do you mean by this, True Lord?"</p><p>"Friend, rest assured, since I have sworn an oath, I will not go back on my word. You can surely sense the blood energy within me; you know I also cultivate my physical body.  If your secret place is beneficial to me, I'm willing to make a trade with you. I will not disappoint you," Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, his tone confident.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King was tempted. Qin Sang, a Nascent Soul cultivator from the outer realms, certainly possessed many treasures.</p><p>While the various demon tribes of the Demon Sea had ancestral legacies and special bloodlines, they were relatively poor and mostly relied on themselves.  Although they could cultivate their bloodlines, they couldn't completely disregard external aids; over time, their bloodlines had become quite thin.</p><p>Seeing the King’s expression, Qin Sang knew he had a chance. He brought out over a dozen jade boxes containing sacred objects from the major sacred sites of the Central Plains demon tribes. He hadn't used force; the demon tribes later learned that he was the Nascent Soul cultivator behind the Dragon Whale tribe, and possibly the only Nascent Soul cultivator in this realm, so they dared not take everything, and voluntarily offered tribute.  Unfortunately, most of it was only useful to the demon race.</p><p>"These treasures, a portion should suffice. As for the rest, as long as you can provide something useful to me, we can exchange it. If you're interested, please prepare it quickly."</p><p>The jade boxes were opened one after another, beams of treasure light shooting up, dazzling the eyes.</p><p>With the constant emergence of Nascent Soul cultivators among the Central Plains demon tribes, the sacred treasures of the sacred sites were certainly not ordinary.  Even the Jiao Dragon King, with his composure, was captivated, his breath becoming heavier.</p><p>"Our tribe indeed has a secret place called the Transformation Dragon Pond, which can cleanse the meridians, refine the blood energy, and has quite an effect. However, no outsider has ever entered. How much you gain depends on your ability," he thought to himself.  *Qin Sang, although a Nascent Soul cultivator, doesn't have a very high physical body cultivation level, and he's human; he certainly won't last long, and won't consume much of the liquid in the pond.*</p><p>…</p><p>After a round of bargaining, and after Qin Sang made another oath, the Jiao Dragon King, despite opposition, invited Qin Sang into the underwater palace.</p><p>Though situated underwater, the Jiao Dragon ancestral land was surprisingly dry. It was filled with brilliant light and precious treasures; even the legendary Dragon Palace could not compare.</p><p>Unlike his visit to the Phoenix tribe, Qin Sang behaved with decorum.  Following the Jiao Dragon King through several palaces, they arrived at a cluster of coral.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King used a spell, took out a golden token, and waved it forward. The coral automatically parted to reveal a path.</p><p>"Please, True Lord!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed. After a short distance, he saw a square stone pool. It was small, only large enough for a young Jiao dragon, half-filled with water, with ethereal mist drifting above it. The mist shifted and changed in a mystical way.</p><p>"This is the Transformation Dragon Pond."</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King pointed to the stone pool, lightly touched the four walls, and the mist thickened.  Hidden within the mist were vague images of true dragons, appearing and disappearing.</p><p>Though he knew it was an illusion, Qin Sang felt a terrifying aura, secretly astonished.</p><p>After carefully examining and confirming there was nothing unusual, he suppressed his true energy, leaped into the air, and landed in the Transformation Dragon Pond in a seated position. The liquid reached about his waist.</p><p>The liquid enveloped him, and Qin Sang first felt a refreshing coolness that seeped from his skin into his flesh, permeating his meridians and washing his bone marrow.</p><p>Before he could fully appreciate it, a loud boom echoed from his blood energy as the coolness abruptly turned into excruciating pain—the familiar agony of meridian cleansing and marrow refinement.</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
