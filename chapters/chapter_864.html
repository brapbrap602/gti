<h1>Chapter 856: Entangled Circumstances</h1><p>Chapter 856: Entangled Circumstances</p><p>“Someone is willing to pay a high price for help…”</p><p>Qin Sang saw the content of the message, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>Looking at the time, it was left three months ago, when he was still saving people with Yue Xiangu and the others.</p><p>The message didn't specify what the person was looking for help with, only that if Qin Sang was interested, he should go to the shop for a detailed discussion.</p><p>After so long, the person has probably already assembled their team, right?</p><p>Qin Sang felt regretful at missing the opportunity.</p><p>He held the jade slip, pondering for a moment, but still decided to visit the shop. The opportunity was rare, perhaps the other party hadn't started their operation yet.</p><p>The other message slips didn't contain important matters. Qin Sang closed his cave abode and went to the market. He removed his cloak and acted in Tianxing City under his true form.</p><p>The shop was open.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang push the door open, the shopkeeper was somewhat surprised and hurriedly got up to greet him, “Daoist Qin, where have you been? Why haven't you been in touch for so long?”</p><p>“I went into seclusion, and upon leaving seclusion, I discovered the Daoist’s message slip, so I hurried over.”</p><p>Qin Sang sat down and said.</p><p>He decided to keep his two identities separate to avoid any connection between them, so he concealed his trip to the Demon Sea.</p><p>As he became involved in more and more matters, Qin Sang increasingly felt that the Seven Killing Hall held countless secrets, involving too many forces and complexities.</p><p>He naturally hoped not to be implicated, but things in this world don't go as one wishes. He could only prepare for the worst.  If one identity was compromised, he could still use his other, clean identity to move around and blend into the world.</p><p>The shopkeeper was startled, then suddenly understood, “I almost forgot, Daoist Qin, you're talking about that matter.”</p><p>“Is the Daoist who was recruiting help still around? Qin needs high-grade spirit stones, as you know, Daoist. It's a rare opportunity.”</p><p>Qin Sang leaned forward and asked.</p><p>“That's uncertain,” the shopkeeper shook his head, taking a sip of tea, “Daoist Qin, that message slip was delivered several months ago. At that time, the other party asked me to introduce trustworthy and highly cultivated Daoists, and I thought of you. But there was no news from your side, so I frankly explained the situation, and then we didn't contact each other again. It just so happened that you were in seclusion, it was really bad luck.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's disappointment, the shopkeeper thought for a moment and said, “Daoist Qin, let me try to contact them. You should return to your cave abode and wait for my news. Currently, there's chaos in the Demon Sea, only allowing entry and not exit, causing the situation within Tiannei Sea to be extremely tense. Many cultivators are afraid of being conscripted and are fleeing Tianxing Island. Someone like Daoist Qin, a high-level cultivator, is not that easy to find. I remember that the other party's requirements were very high, they might not have gathered enough people yet.”</p><p>“Thank you, Daoist!”</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, bowed his thanks, exchanged pleasantries for a while, and then headed towards the auction house.</p><p>After sending Qin Sang away, the shopkeeper tapped his fingers on the table, pondered for a moment, closed the shop door, and hurriedly left.</p><p>A short while later, the shopkeeper arrived at a courtyard on the edge of Tianxing City and knocked on the door.</p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>A deep voice came from the courtyard.</p><p>The shopkeeper pushed the door open and saw a man in black robes, the same person who had sold Qin Sang the high-grade spirit stones. He bowed and asked, “Senior Brother, is there any news from Senior Brother?”</p><p>“Not yet.”</p><p>The man in black robes shook his head slightly, “But it should be soon. The Demon Sea matter is of great importance, all factions of humankind cannot stand idly by. High-level cultivators have all been dispatched to the Demon Sea to defend the islands, which gives us a chance. With Senior Brother's abilities, investigating information is a piece of cake. It's a pity that our Master is also trapped in the Demon Sea and cannot get away. Otherwise, we could directly attack; there's no need for so much trouble.”</p><p>“Master is definitely unable to come?”</p><p>The shopkeeper's expression changed, “We have been planning for so long, have all those loose cultivators we bought over been useless?”</p><p>The black-robed man sighed, “As the saying goes, man proposes, God disposes. Although Master correctly predicted the Demon Race's movement and the tense situation in the Demon Sea, he didn't expect such a large-scale riot. The Demon Race is practically mad. That Grand Witch Priest, a mere woman, is incompetent, possessing great cultivation yet allowing the Demon Race to attack Tianwu Island, almost losing the teleportation array, causing Master to also be trapped there. Without Master, relying solely on us, we cannot directly attack their sect. Even if we obtain the treasure, we cannot suppress the loose cultivators. However, our plan is not completely useless. This kind of opportunity is rare in a century. Senior Brother sent a message saying that Master ordered us to find the whereabouts of that treasure at all costs, whether by stealing or robbing, we must get it. Senior Brother is resourceful. Besides us, no one knows the details of this treasure. The opportunity is still great. In addition, Master will escape from Tianwu Island as soon as possible. There will always be a need for manpower then, so let's keep them for now…”</p><p>The shopkeeper breathed a sigh of relief, “That's good. Being able to ease Master's worries, our efforts haven't been in vain.”</p><p>The cloaked man glanced at him.  "Don't worry, Master won't mistreat those who have served him well.  I've seen all you've done, and I've reported it fully to Master. He's aware of it.  By the way, what brings you here today?"</p><p>"There's something. Brother, remember the person who bought your high-grade spirit stones?  He's been in secluded cultivation, but he contacted me after receiving a message. We can be certain he's not connected to any of the major factions.  The question is, do you still need him...?"</p><p>The shopkeeper whispered.</p><p>"Oh, that person!"</p><p>The cloaked man recalled Qin Sang. "I remember. His cultivation was mid-stage Core Formation."</p><p>"That's right," the shopkeeper nodded. "Even though he's been in seclusion, I don't think his cultivation has improved much. He's probably been practicing some technique.  A cultivator who reaches this level without backing will be strong."</p><p>The cloaked man hummed, then mused, "According to the original plan, whether or not we use him is debatable. But Master can't come himself, and with just a few of us, it's hard to suppress those late-stage Core Formation monsters. They might take our payment and betray us. Luckily, we've been wary of them and haven't revealed our true objective. Otherwise, we'd be in a terrible situation now. Someone like Qin, however, is easier to control.  But the specifics, the number of people we need... we'll have to wait for the news from the eldest brother..."</p><p>"What do you mean, Brother?"</p><p>"Let's bring him in. It's just a few high-grade spirit stones. Compared to the treasure Master seeks, it's nothing!" The cloaked man slammed his hand on the table.</p><p>The shopkeeper's face brightened. "I've kept him waiting, told him to stay in his cave and await news.  Brother, come by my place in a few days, and I'll summon him."</p><p>The cloaked man nodded.</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang was heading towards the auction house. Seeing the desolate market, he began to consider whether he should temporarily leave Tian Xing Island and lay low.</p>
