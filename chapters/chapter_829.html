<h1>Chapter 821: The Life Gate</h1><p>Chapter 821: The Life Gate</p><p>The woman's strength noticeably weakened with each injury. Her strongest techniques were ineffective against Qin Sang, and now she no longer attempted to kill him, merely dodging his attacks.  But when Qin Sang tried to shake her off, she would burn her soul body, relentlessly pursuing him. Like a clinging burr, she was incredibly annoying.</p><p>It was clear the woman wasn't a mindless vengeful spirit.  She was intelligent, understanding Qin Sang's intentions and accurately assessing the situation.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't entirely without gains. Throughout their fight, he had been observing. He didn't believe a Nascent Soul stage soul body possessed true immortality; he was sure he'd overlooked something.</p><p>As the woman's strength waned, she finally revealed some unusual characteristics.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly activated its celestial eye.</p><p>It discovered that every time the woman's soul body shattered, there was an unusual fluctuation within.</p><p>Initially, even with Tianmu Butterfly’s focused gaze, only a faint, fleeting glimmer could be seen flowing within her, so subtle it seemed like an illusion.</p><p>As the woman weakened, she could no longer completely conceal it.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The ebony sword pierced her chest again.</p><p>With Tianmu Butterfly constantly focused on her, Qin Sang finally captured the essence of that glimmer.</p><p>To his surprise, within the light was a tiny, transparent crystal, invisible to the naked eye. Every time the woman was injured, the crystal emitted light.  And it was constantly moving within her.</p><p>"What is this? I've never seen anything like it. Let's call it a soul crystal..."</p><p>Qin Sang remained outwardly calm, silently speculating. His knowledge of the Corpse Ghost Path wasn't shallow, yet he'd never encountered such a strange soul body before—a testament to the power of a Yuan Ying cultivator's soul refinement.</p><p>His intuition told him the soul crystal was crucial to the woman, perhaps akin to a life gate.</p><p>However, destroying the soul crystal wouldn't be easy. It was hidden and constantly moving, only revealing itself when the woman was critically injured.  And she was undoubtedly highly protective of it.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, a plan gradually forming. After discovering the woman's ability to burn her soul body, he completely abandoned any thought of escape.</p><p>The woman had to die, and quickly.</p><p>With each passing moment, his situation became more precarious.</p><p>Just then, the woman seemed to hear something, pausing slightly and turning towards the nearby sea.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang also heard the sound of a flying cultivator.</p><p>Looking in that direction, a dark spot appeared on the sea's surface. A cultivator was approaching on a flying sword, heading straight towards the Yuan Ying battle – clearly drawn by the unusual phenomena.</p><p>Initially, the strange lights on Liangqiu Island strongly resembled the signs of a treasure's appearance.  It wasn't surprising that someone would think so after seeing the strange lights.</p><p>When Qin Sang left the island, he noticed cultivators on nearby islands were becoming restless.</p><p>These people, lured by the treasure, still came to fish in troubled waters even after the momentous battle had begun.</p><p>The woman let out a strange laugh, her figure vanishing on the spot. For the first time, she abandoned her pursuit of Qin Sang, rushing towards the incoming cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed, muttering "Damn it!"  He tried to intercept her, but it was too late. Soon, he heard a scream, and the approaching cultivator's light vanished.</p><p>When Qin Sang arrived, he saw the cultivator's body rapidly shriveling, his face etched with terror, his blood and essence completely devoured, leaving behind only a desiccated corpse.</p><p>People risk their lives for wealth; birds die for food – it's only natural.</p><p>The woman jumped off the corpse, licking her lips with a look of ecstasy. Her soul body had noticeably solidified!</p><p>"She can consume life force to recover herself."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.</p><p>Many cultivators were around Qu Heng Island. If this continued, more would be drawn in. If the woman found enough life force to feed on, his efforts would be in vain.</p><p>"Damn fiend!"</p><p>Qin Sang cursed, launching a relentless attack without mercy.</p><p>The woman changed tactics, avoiding direct confrontation with Qin Sang and resorting to hit-and-run. The Nine Nether Demon Fire, despite its spectacular power, repeatedly failed, leaving Qin Sang helpless.</p><p>He couldn't kill her or shake her off.</p><p>The woman laughed maniacally, her eyes gleaming with a strange light, already anticipating the delicious life force of Qin Sang.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire missed again, but this time was different.  The moment it brushed past the woman, it suddenly exploded.</p><p>The woman was injured, quickly retreating, but immediately afterward, sword lights flew up from below, piercing towards her.  She wasn't panicked, dodging several sword lights as she moved, only getting hit by one.</p><p>The woman's soul body, damaged in the skirmish, began to regenerate, her wounds closing.</p><p>In Tianmudie's sight, a light emanated from within the woman, surging towards her wound.  At the same time, the soul crystal on her chest revealed a moving trail.</p><p>Now!</p><p>Qin Sang had been waiting for this moment, urging silently, "Go!"</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A blue light appeared from Qin Sang's dantian, tracing a beautiful arc.</p><p>Xingluo!</p><p>Since obtaining this treasure, it had been refining his true energy within his dantian, reaching its peak power, yet it had never drawn blood.</p><p>Xingluo had only one chance, a treasure that could decide the outcome.</p><p>Only by ensuring its effectiveness would Qin Sang use it.</p><p>The same treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang's role reversed, becoming the wielder, while the target became the woman.</p><p>Xingluo's blue light arrived instantly, appearing before her. The woman's smile vanished, replaced by terror.  This was not only due to Xingluo's astonishing power, but also because of its target: her most important soul crystal.</p><p>'Aaah…'</p><p>The woman let out a desperate scream.</p><p>At that moment, a pale light erupted from her soul body, rapidly converging towards the soul crystal, forming a protective barrier, layer upon layer.</p><p>Xingluo struck.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The pale light and blue light collided, canceling each other out, but ultimately the blue light prevailed.</p><p>The barrier shattered.</p><p>The soul crystal was completely exposed to Xingluo.</p><p>The woman looked down at her chest, her face filled with disbelief, watching helplessly as her soul crystal was shattered by Xingluo, the light in her eyes fading completely.</p><p>Xingluo passed through the woman's chest, revealing its form.</p><p>This time, the woman's soul body could not recover. From her chest, cracks rapidly spread across her entire body, shattering instantly and dissipating into the night wind.</p><p>Qin Sang rushed over, unleashing the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire to sweep across a large area.  Confirming the woman was truly dead, impossible to revive, and leaving nothing behind, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>She wasn't his most dangerous opponent, but she was the most tenacious.  With all his treasures and Tianmudie's help, he finally managed to eliminate her.</p><p>Qin Sang felt utterly exhausted, but now wasn't the time to rest.</p><p>He put away his treasures and looked into the distance.</p><p>There, a thick yellow pillar of light shone brightly in the night sky, unchanging for a long time, indicating that the occupation was likely stabilized, and that Luo Daotong's Yuan Ying was probably in serious trouble.</p><p>After those people succeeded, their next target would be him. Fortunately, he had eliminated the woman.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not delay, swallowed a few spirit pills, and fled.</p>
