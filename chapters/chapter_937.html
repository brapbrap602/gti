<h1>Chapter 929: Spirit Cicada Cave</h1><p>“I'm here for my own reasons, not because of your invitation.”</p><p>The withered cicada, known as Old Devil Fang, transmitted his voice coldly.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess didn't take offense to Old Devil Fang's attitude. “Fellow Daoist Fang's presence here is a deterrent to them, making things much easier for me. As for what you intend to do inside the Seven Kills Hall, I won't interfere. I only hope that during this time, Fellow Daoist Fang can cooperate with me in front of Master Lingzhu and play along.”</p><p>Old Devil Fang remained silent for a moment, seemingly acquiescing.</p><p>Seeing this, a hint of joy appeared on the Grand Witch Priestess's face. “Fellow Daoist Fang's arrival is timely.  Controlling this Thousand Swords Formation alone is somewhat strenuous.  Having your help will make things much easier.”</p><p>She paused, making one last attempt. “Are you really not considering cooperating with me? If we find the ancient witch legacy, it will benefit our Witch Clan for generations to come. Both of us will also gain from it, perhaps even glimpsing an opportunity for Deity Transformation. It might even greatly increase your chances of regaining your human form. After all, human cultivation methods are somewhat incompatible with our Witch Clan, and this becomes more apparent the higher the realm. Otherwise, why wouldn’t our Witch Clan have produced even a single Deity Transformation cultivator? Surely, Fellow Daoist Fang understood this during your Nascent Soul formation…”</p><p>Before she could finish, Old Devil Fang interrupted. “My cultivation is meager. I can only look after myself and don’t possess Grand Witch Priestess’s benevolent heart, concerned with the well-being of future generations. What you’ve offered is not enough to convince me. The idea that a human sacred ground would hold an ancient witch legacy is absurd! There’s no need to waste words. I will cooperate with your charade, but once inside the Seven Kills Hall, I will not be bound by you.”</p><p>“I'm already overwhelmed dealing with Master Lingzhu; how would I have the energy to restrain you?” The Grand Witch Priestess sighed softly. “Then thank you, Fellow Daoist Fang!”</p><p>Their exchange was brief. Outsiders couldn't hear their conversation, only seeing the Grand Witch Priestess personally welcoming Old Devil Fang back into their ranks amicably.</p><p>The other Nascent Soul Witch Clan members bowed respectfully to Old Devil Fang.</p><p>It seemed as though they had already discussed this beforehand, causing the faces of the human Nascent Soul cultivators to darken.</p><p>“I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Fang to also emerge from Spirit Cicada Cave! This old Daoist is even more curious now. The Seven Kills Hall, aside from the inner hall that opens every few centuries, has been searched inch by inch countless times by generations of human experts. What could possibly be there to warrant both of you personally investigating it?” Master Lingzhu stared at the Grand Witch Priestess and Old Devil Fang, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>Old Devil Fang remained silent.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess spoke with a hint of sarcasm, “Will Master Lingzhu follow me every step of the way, just like the Demon Lord did last time? Then you'll know what I'm looking for. Why ask?”</p><p>“This old Daoist does indeed intend to follow the Grand Witch Priestess and broaden my horizons.  Perhaps I can even lend a hand if you encounter any difficulties.” Master Lingzhu readily admitted. Then, his tone shifted. “However, my greatest concern now is that the number of Nascent Soul cultivators entering the Seven Kills Hall exceeds the limit. The Thousand Swords Formation won't be able to completely mask our presence. When breaking the formation, it might trigger the Immortal Formation’s alarm, causing complications for everyone.”</p><p>“That’s easy to solve.” The Grand Witch Priestess sneered, turning to an elder. “Elder Feng?”</p><p>Understanding, the elder took out a jade talisman and presented it to Old Devil Fang. “Fellow Daoist Fang, this is a protective talisman. I will wait outside the storm for the Grand Witch Priestess and yourself.”</p><p>The talisman looked similar to the one Qin Sang held, but the runes on it were several times more complex.</p><p>Old Devil Fang accepted the talisman without hesitation.</p><p>The elder turned and left, vanishing into the storm in a few flashes.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess addressed Master Lingzhu. “Are you no longer worried, Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>Master Lingzhu didn't press the matter further.  After a moment of contemplation, he transmitted his voice to the human Nascent Soul cultivators. “With Old Devil Fang's unexpected appearance, it seems we need to adjust our strategy…”</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators’ expressions varied after hearing Master Lingzhu’s words.</p><p>Several of the demonic cultivators' faces were grim, seemingly greatly dissatisfied with Master Lingzhu's arrangements.</p><p>Old Devil Mou was the most displeased.</p><p>“After completing these tasks, you are free to search for treasures. If anyone dares to disregard my words and jeopardizes the mission, you won't need me to act; the Demon Lord will not tolerate you…” Master Lingzhu stared at the demonic cultivators, his eyes flashing coldly.</p><p>The demonic cultivators exchanged glances, their expressions shifting several times before finally falling silent.</p><p>A hint of urgency flickered in Old Devil Mou’s eyes as he scanned the other Nascent Soul cultivators, then glanced down at the Golden Core cultivators outside, lost in thought.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang and the others were unaware of the undercurrents among the Nascent Soul ancestors.</p><p>After the withered cicada appeared, the Golden Core cultivators had been buzzing with discussion.</p><p>“Is he the infamous Witch Clan’s Fang… the one who, according to legend, failed his Nascent Soul formation and fused with his fourth stage nascent insect?”</p><p>“That's him! I thought it was just a rumor, but I never expected to see him in person!”</p><p>Even the human cultivators were awed by Old Devil Fang's actions, filled with admiration. One asked a nearby Witch Clan cultivator, “This must be unprecedented, right?”</p><p>The Witch Clan cultivator nodded. “In our Witch Clan, fusing one’s primordial spirit with a nascent insect… there might have been others who considered it, but only Senior Fang succeeded. It’s said that after Senior Fang’s success, many fellow Daoists who had lost hope of Nascent Soul formation attempted to emulate him, all perishing. Some even had their souls scattered along with their nascent insects, losing any chance of reincarnation.”</p><p>“What a ruthless individual…”</p><p>Qin Sang leaned closer, listening to their discussion, murmuring in astonishment, “It's actually him!”</p><p>He had heard legends of Old Devil Fang when he first arrived at the Vast Waves Sea and landed on the Witch God Continent.</p><p>This man’s actions were shocking, his legend spreading even to the remote Western Frontier. Even more astonishing was that he had actually succeeded, becoming a spirit insect yet still alive and well.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess personally welcoming him clearly indicated her high regard for him.</p><p>It seemed that he had not only broken through the Nascent Soul bottleneck using this method but his cultivation hadn't stagnated either, reaching a level comparable to the Grand Witch Priestess.</p><p>“Is Senior Fang also a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator?” Qin Sang interjected.</p><p>The Witch Clan cultivator glanced at him, hearing Qin Sang also address him as “Senior,” his tone softened. “Senior Fang’s situation is unique, one of a kind. No one can say for sure what his true realm is. But Senior Fang's reputation is no less than the Witch Priestess's, so his strength is likely comparable.”</p><p>Qin Sang later heard more stories about Old Devil Fang.</p><p>However, with the man himself present, no one dared to speak freely, only hinting at his deeds.</p><p>Old Devil Fang not only had prestige, but also notoriety, being an unpredictable and ruthless figure.</p>
