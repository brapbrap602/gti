<h1>Chapter 1263: A Dance of Blades and Shadows</h1><p>The figures of Elder Tianzheng and the Nether Demon Lord vanished simultaneously.</p><p>In the void, only a river of stars remained, as if a segment had been plucked from the celestial Milky Way.</p><p>Yet, at the center of this starry river, a shadow began to emerge, starkly out of place amidst the dazzling brilliance. The shadow, dark as ink, spread outward, devouring the stars like a voracious beast.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord was currently the foremost expert in the Frost Domain, second only to the venerable True One within the alliance of the two realms.</p><p>Elder Tianzheng, too, had long been a renowned figure.</p><p>Alongside the infamous Ye Demon and another cultivator known as Cang Hong, he was counted among the three great titans of the Sin Abyss. Among them, Ye Demon's notoriety was unmatched, widely acknowledged as the supreme figure of the North Star Realm. Even a single blood demon avatar of Ye Demon, comparable to his true form, was enough to secure his position as the undisputed leader.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord was counterattacking, but for the time being, he found it difficult to break free from the Star River Tome.</p><p>However, Elder Tianzheng was also unable to divert his attention to deal with Qin Sang, so he could only summon a Star Light Warrior, a move that was better than nothing.</p><p>The Star Light Warrior stood three zhang tall, its body carved from crystal, imposing and robust, with sharp, angular features and an expressionless face.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Star Light Sect. The Star Light Warrior was their signature secret technique, crafted by gathering starlight and moonlight into talismans, meticulously refined to transform into a warrior of Nascent Soul level upon activation.</p><p>This was one of the talisman soldiers his senior sister had mentioned, akin to the art of scattering beans to summon an army.</p><p>The Star Light Warrior possessed immense strength and, to some extent, was an indestructible entity, born with an innate combat instinct.</p><p>Once the talisman soldier was summoned, the cultivator need not expend further effort to control it, and there was no fear of it turning against its master. It was the perfect aid in battle.</p><p>The only drawback was the immense cost.</p><p>Years of preparation and vast amounts of energy were required to refine a single Star Light Warrior, and it could only be used once. Once its talismanic power was exhausted, it would dissipate, never to be restored, necessitating a complete re-forging.</p><p>Thus, the Star Light Sect treated these warriors as treasures, rarely deploying them unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>To hinder Qin Sang, Elder Tianzheng unhesitatingly summoned a Star Light Warrior.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a flash of light before him, and the Star Light Warrior appeared, blocking his path. A glowing fist came crashing toward him.</p><p>The warrior's body was composed of starlight, blurring the line between reality and illusion, but the power behind the punch was undeniable. The force of the punch created a vortex of storm in the void.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The starlight on the warrior's body flared brilliantly, converging at the front of the fist. The storm vortex rapidly expanded, and the surrounding blood mist was powerless to resist, sucked into the vortex, forming a visible wave of blood.</p><p>Qin Sang felt his entire body tighten as the massive fist approached, yet his expression remained calm, and his speed did not falter in the slightest.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang barked.</p><p>The demonic fire, having shattered the ancient restriction, had not been recalled by Qin Sang. It continued to swirl around him, now transforming into a black dragon that lunged forward.</p><p>At the same time, a tortoise-shell shield materialized in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>Almost the instant the shield appeared, the Star Light Warrior's fist slammed into it, producing a sharp, ear-piercing screech.</p><p>This was the shell of the Nine-Life Mystic Tortoise. Even with only a few simple refining techniques applied by Qin Sang, it was a rare defensive treasure, effortlessly withstanding the Star Light Warrior's powerful punch.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were cold, and his speed increased as he pressed forward, using the shield to close the distance to the Star Light Warrior. He reached out with one hand, grabbing the warrior's fist, while his other hand formed a fist and struck at the warrior's face.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire enveloped the Star Light Warrior, surrounding it completely.</p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p><p>A series of dull thuds echoed from within the demonic fire, causing the void to tremble.</p><p>Elder Tianzheng couldn't help but glance over, his face filled with astonishment. This man was actually engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Star Light Warrior!</p><p>It was only then that he remembered—this man was a transformed demon beast, so of course his physical body was formidable. It was just that the rumors he had heard earlier, filled with mentions of demon banners, spirit swords, and sword formations—common tools of cultivators—had nearly made him forget the man's true nature.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A heart-wrenching roar erupted from within the demonic fire.</p><p>Then, with a deafening explosion, the demonic fire suddenly burst, and a ball of white light shot backward, faintly revealing the silhouette of the Star Light Warrior's body.</p><p>Elder Tianzheng's eyelids twitched. The Star Light Warrior had been forced back to its original form in a single exchange, battered by Qin Sang's fists and the demonic fire, without even the need for a sword formation.</p><p>He hadn't expected the Star Light Warrior to hold Qin Sang for long, but he hadn't anticipated it would be so easily defeated.</p><p>Though the warrior had been forced back to its original form, it had not been destroyed. As long as its talismanic power remained, it could easily reform, but it was already too late to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang broke through the blockade and saw the blood demon avatar engaged in a one-against-two battle.</p><p>The Blood Moon Wheel spun rapidly, its target Qing Jun's jade neck. Wherever it passed, a sea of blood light surged, as if it could tear the void apart, its momentum utterly terrifying.</p><p>Qing Jun, closely following Ye Demon's true form, was about to dive into the blood pool when the Blood Moon Wheel struck.</p><p>She didn't even glance at the Blood Moon Wheel, her momentum unbroken, but the Five Directions Pagoda in her hand trembled slightly. In the next moment, it appeared above the Blood Moon Wheel.</p><p>A resonant hum filled the air.</p><p>The phantom of the Five Directions Pagoda reappeared.</p><p>As expected, the blood light was suppressed by the Mystic Pagoda, but the Blood Moon Wheel was extraordinary, still pushing forward, breaking through the suppression.</p><p>Though the Five Directions Pagoda failed to fully restrain the Blood Moon Wheel, it created an opportunity for Qing Jun. With a leap, she plunged into the blood pool, slipping through the gap between two black chains and disappearing into the depths of the bloody waters.</p><p>At the same time, the Five Directions Pagoda flashed and followed Qing Jun into the pool.</p><p>The blood demon avatar did not pursue Qing Jun, merely letting out a disdainful sneer.</p><p>If his true form, fighting one-on-one, could still lose, he would be unworthy of his title as the supreme figure of the North Star Realm.</p><p>"Screech!"</p><p>Jing Yu let out a piercing cry. She was more eager than anyone present to obtain the treasure within the blood pool.</p><p>The Thunder Bead glowed brightly, giving birth to a new phantom of the Thunder Falcon.</p><p>This phantom, however, was more substantial than the previous one.</p><p>The phantom stretched its neck and let out a long cry, its wings spreading as it charged toward the blood demon avatar.</p><p>Unwilling to take the attack head-on, the blood demon avatar shifted sideways, momentarily pausing, but his lips continued to move, chanting an incantation.</p><p>At that moment, countless blood-red runes materialized around Jing Yu, swirling around her in a bizarre, twisting dance.</p><p>Jing Yu felt her blood boil, as if the runes were trying to drain it from her body.</p><p>She had heard Qin Sang speak of Ye Demon's techniques, and seeing this, she knew she could not allow him to complete his secret art. Immediately, she activated her bloodline power, and arcs of lightning danced across her feathers.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>A thunderstorm erupted around Jing Yu, countless bolts of lightning surging in all directions, tearing the runes apart.</p><p>Jing Yu merged with one of the lightning bolts, shooting toward the blood pool at an astonishing speed!</p><p>The blood demon avatar frowned, having underestimated Jing Yu's natural mastery of thunder evasion. Just as Qing Jun escaped, he redirected the Blood Moon Wheel, slashing it toward Jing Yu.</p><p>"Clang!"</p><p>The Blood Moon Wheel struck empty air, producing a metallic clang.</p><p>Then, a flying sword materialized from the void. It was Qin Sang, who had just repelled the Star Light Warrior. Seeing the situation, he quickly summoned the Ebony Sword to block the Blood Moon Wheel for Jing Yu.</p><p>The interior of the blood pool was also highly complex, and only Jing Yu knew the exact location of the Corpse Flower Blood Amber.</p><p>Feeling the pressure lift, Jing Yu breathed a sigh of relief and, without looking back, dove into the blood pool.</p>
