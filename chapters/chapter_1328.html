<h1>Chapter 1320: Mountain within a Mountain</h1><p>Chapter 1320: Mountain within a Mountain</p><p>The giant peak was hollow inside!</p><p>They stood on the summit, the foothold only wide enough for three people.</p><p>The vast mountain pass was filled with crimson smoke, constantly rising from below, then blocked by a restriction, accumulating at the mouth of the pass to form a thick layer of red mist.</p><p>The scene within the mountain was completely obscured by the red mist.</p><p>Upon arriving here, the Fire Jade Centipede became even more agitated, but was restrained by Qin Sang's restriction, unable to move.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down, staring at the red mist for a while, and asked, "Fellow Daoist, what kind of treasure are you refining? What can Xiang Daoist and I do?"</p><p>Bing Han said calmly, "Daoist Qin, go and take a look below."</p><p>As she spoke, she took out a cold jade pendant and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang took it, and immediately felt a chill flowing into his body.</p><p>On the jade pendant was the character 'xu' (虛).  When he channeled his true energy into the character, he immediately felt a connection to the forbidden area's formation, instantly feeling much cooler.</p><p>"The fire poison below is intense. Using the cold jade pendant will save you a lot of trouble."</p><p>Bing Han said, and with a step, she disappeared into the red mist.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly followed.</p><p>He had wanted to activate the Fire Lotus Seed and condense a fire armor to protect his body, but since he had the cold jade pendant, he temporarily put it away and waited to see what would happen.</p><p>The two figures rapidly descended.</p><p>Under the effect of the cold jade pendant, the red mist dispersed to the sides.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard that when refining treasures,  Xu Ling Sect disciples, if their cultivation was sufficient, the best place to refine was a mountain within a mountain. However, along the way, he hadn't seen a single person.</p><p>They descended to an unknown depth.</p><p>Bing Han suddenly stopped.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped as well, discovering that the red mist was gone, but the entire void was filled with extremely pure flame energy, so intense that only crimson was visible.</p><p>"Is this the mountain within a mountain?"</p><p>Following Bing Han's gaze, Qin Sang saw the outline of a mountain in the distance.</p><p>In essence, it was a naturally formed stone.</p><p>The stone was pointed at the top and wide at the bottom, shaped like a mountain peak, and comparable in size to a mountain—truly a mountain within a mountain.</p><p>The entirely crimson stone mountain blended perfectly with the surrounding flame energy.  The surface of the stone mountain was uneven, but without sharp edges, as if smoothed by the underground magma veins.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly descended, and saw what was beneath the stone mountain.</p><p>Astonishingly, the bottom was empty, with no support; the stone mountain was suspended in mid-air.</p><p>He closed his eyes slightly, and with careful sensing, he discovered that the stone mountain's suspension wasn't due to restrictions or formations, but a naturally formed spectacle.</p><p>The underground magma veins pierced through the surrounding mountain walls, converging here, forming a pattern of a "flame dragon holding a pearl."</p><p>This geological formation was extremely rare, with the stone mountain being the pearl.</p><p>Perhaps the stone mountain was originally just an ordinary boulder.</p><p>After countless years, constantly tempered by the flame energy, it had transformed. The stone mountain was almost transparent, jade-like in texture, as if flames were burning within.</p><p>Gorgeous, dreamlike.</p><p>Qin Sang marveled at this natural masterpiece.</p><p>He found it strange that he could sense the fluctuations of the underground magma veins outside, yet here, it was calm.</p><p>Bing Han flew towards the mountain within a mountain. "Years ago, a earthquake occurred in the Xiao Han region. My sect's ancestor unexpectedly discovered this place, determining it to be the ideal location for the sect's headquarters and established the sect here. This mountain's transformation into its current state is due to both natural processes and the efforts of our sect's ancestor."</p><p>As she spoke, Qin Sang and Bing Han landed on the mountain.</p><p>At that moment, the Fire Jade Centipede reacted even more violently, drawn to something inside the mountain within a mountain!</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang finally sensed another fluctuation, from deep within the mountain within a mountain.</p><p>This fluctuation was very weak, beating like a heart, one pulse at a time.</p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p>A look of surprise appeared in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Bing Han nodded. "Our ancestor determined that a strange fire spirit would surely be nurtured within the mountain.  The forbidden area formation was also set up for this purpose, to accelerate the fire spirit's development. For many years, we of the Xu Ling Sect have been preparing for this, but no one knew when that moment would arrive, or in what form.  Until a hundred years ago, signs finally appeared, originating from a core fire jade within the mountain within a mountain."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist wants to refine the fire spirit and this fire jade together into a treasure? No wonder you need Xiang Daoist and me to help," Qin Sang roughly understood Bing Han's plan.</p><p>Excellent! The Fire Spirit and Fire Jade are born together.  If we combine it with other precious spiritual materials and refine the Fire Jade into a spiritual embryo, and then continue to nurture it within the Mountain Within a Mountain, there's a chance it will develop sentience!"</p><p>Bing Han nodded. "This Fire Spirit was born here, inseparable from the Mountain Within a Mountain. It can easily manipulate the power of the flame veins, and it will instinctively resist.  The methods prepared by our ancestors haven't had much effect on it. After much thought, I came up with a way to use a special spiritual array to barely manage it. But we also need a high-grade spirit fire that the Fire Spirit will instinctively fear, to easily suppress it."</p><p>Bing Han turned to Qin Sang. "Many cultivators in the Northern Star Region are proficient in fire manipulation, but only the Ancestral Sacred Fire of the Qingyang Demon Sect surpasses the Mountain Within a Mountain in spirit fire grade. Qin Daoist's spirit fire, as shown on the Divine Firmament Peak, seems even superior to the Ancestral Sacred Fire.  Daoist Xiang just tried, and his Ancestral Sacred Fire was too weak to completely subdue the Fire Spirit. Instead, the Fire Spirit targeted him, causing fire poison to enter his body, nearly resulting in a disaster. We had to stop immediately. If the two of you work together, it should be much easier.  Refining this spiritual treasure is of great significance to the Xu Ling Sect. Now you understand why I asked you to make such a harsh oath."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>So the fluctuation in the underground flame veins was caused by the Fire Spirit's resistance.</p><p>Bing Han and Xiang Qing had tried countless times, all unsuccessfully, so they had to ask for his help.</p><p>"Daoist, you have great courage! Once the spiritual treasure is refined, the Xu Ling Sect can thrive for generations. But you mentioned refining it into a spiritual embryo and continuing to nurture it here. It will take many years for it to develop sentience and become a spiritual treasure.  You might not be able to use it yourself, then."</p><p>Actually, there might be another choice.</p><p>Bing Han is proficient in refining, and could try to incorporate the Fire Jade into her own life treasure, making it easier to create the spiritual treasure.</p><p>Doing so would only benefit her alone.</p><p>Also, this would only work if Bing Han is confident in breaking through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage, or even the late Yuan Ying stage. Otherwise, the Xu Ling Sect's generations of planning would be wasted.</p><p>Bing Han looked quietly at the stone mountain and softly said, "Once the spiritual treasure is refined, and future generations of the Xu Ling Sect can benefit from it, I can die without regrets, worthy of my position as Sect Master."</p><p>Qin Sang was silent, his respect for Bing Han increased.</p><p>He had interacted with several righteous sect masters of the Lesser Cold Region: Chong Yi Daochang, Bing Han, and even Dongyang Bo. They all possessed the courage to prioritize their sect's interests.</p><p>"Let's go look at that Fire Jade," Qin Sang said.</p><p>It seems the treasure that attracted the Fire Jade Centipede was the Fire Jade.</p><p>Bing Han's process of refining the spiritual embryo would be very instructive for him.</p>
