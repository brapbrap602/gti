<h1>Chapter 364: Azure Sun Demonic Sect</h1><p>Qin Sang had prepared everything he needed. First, he went to the Earth Sinkhole to retrieve the living corpse.</p><p>After being nurtured by the baleful qi for this period, the living corpse's energy sea was fully restored. Qin Sang found a deserted place, summoned the living corpse, and tested its strength.</p><p>Although the living corpse's original body was Liang Yan, its abilities were limited, and the earth-bound baleful qi couldn't be replenished during combat. Its strength was inferior to a true mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator, but definitely far superior to a baleful corpse.</p><p>Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivators had to be cautious when facing this living corpse. A moment of carelessness could result in injury from the living corpse, leading to corpse poison entering the body and suffering the same fate as Senior Sister Qing Ting.</p><p>Qin Sang was very satisfied. After retrieving the talismans from Shopkeeper Wu's store, he mounted the Stygian Cloud and flew directly east towards the Severed Sky Mountains.</p><p>Within a month, Qin Sang arrived at the Severed Sky Mountains, near the branch altar of the Heavenly Corpse Sect.  Three spiritual veins converged here, creating a mystical terrain. This place had likely been claimed as a cave dwelling by a senior brother from Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Qin Sang had no desire to revisit the old place.  He merely recalled past experiences, as well as old friends like Senior Sister Qing Ting and Yu Daiyue. His escaping light paused briefly, glancing towards the Heavenly Corpse Cave before turning northeast.</p><p>Due to the Pure Yang Sect's deterrence, the demonic sects had either migrated north, retreated deeper into the Severed Sky Mountains, or kept an extremely low profile.  Initially, Qin Sang rarely encountered demonic cultivators.</p><p>Upon entering the heart of the demonic territory, Qin Sang's appearance underwent a significant transformation.</p><p>Now, he wore a hooded cloak and black robes. His aura appeared normal, unlike the gloomy aura of demonic cultivators, but he carried a black coffin on his back.</p><p>This black coffin was the simplest corpse refinement tool described in the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*.</p><p>Corpse Puppet Pouches were extremely difficult to refine, and the vast majority of Heavenly Corpse Sect disciples could only use this kind of black coffin.</p><p>Aside from storing and refining corpses, the black coffin had no other abilities, and its refinement wasn't complex.  After obtaining the jade slip from Shopkeeper Wu, Qin Sang successfully refined one after a few attempts.</p><p>A baleful corpse was stored inside the black coffin, with faint corpse qi seeping out. Qin Sang used this as a disguise; no one could say he didn't resemble a demonic cultivator.</p><p>Coupled with Qin Sang's low-key behavior and focus on his journey, he didn't encounter any troublemakers along the way and finally arrived at their agreed meeting place within the appointed time.</p><p>Boundless Valley.</p><p>It was said that all the ferocious and bloody baleful qi between heaven and earth converged here. The ferocious bloody baleful qi within the valley birthed countless blood demons and devilish creatures, and many Yin Beasts and demonic creatures hid within, influenced to become violent and bloodthirsty.</p><p>The most terrifying things weren't these demonic creatures, but the ubiquitous ancient restrictions within the valley. Some restrictions were even more terrifying than spatial rifts.</p><p>Even more frightening, in some places, spatial rifts and ancient restrictions were intermingled.  Even Nascent Soul cultivators could only detour around them. It was one of the most dangerous places in the Severed Sky Mountains.</p><p>The valley was divided into three layers.</p><p>Most cultivators could only operate in the first layer.</p><p>Entering the second layer required Foundation Establishment cultivation. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators only dared to move along the few already explored paths within the vast Boundless Valley and had to remain constantly vigilant, as a single misstep could mean death.</p><p>Countless cultivators were buried here.</p><p>As for the third layer, the inner valley of Boundless Valley, it could no longer be simply described as "dangerous." Every step was a death trap, a dead end!</p><p>Qin Sang learned all this in a demonic market called Azure Sun Market.</p><p>Azure Sun Market was still some distance from Boundless Valley, but its fame was considerable. The demonic sect it was affiliated with, the Azure Sun Demonic Sect, was renowned throughout the Small Cold Region.</p><p>One of the seven great passes of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, Azure Sun City, was named after an ancestor of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect!</p><p>The Azure Sun Demonic Sect's most famous technique, the Azure Sun Demonic Fire, was not only powerful and feared by the sect's enemies but also had a peculiar origin.  It was said to be a secret method of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect, refining the Azure Sun Divine罡, one of the Heavenly罡Qi from the Nine Heavens, to give birth to a type of demonic fire.</p><p>In the Nine Heavens, Heavenly罡winds raged, soul-piercing and bone-eroding.</p><p>The higher one ascended, the more terrifying the罡winds became.  Let alone disciples of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect, even Nascent Soul cultivators were incapable of passing through the罡wind belt to gather Heavenly罡Qi from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>The ancestor of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect obtained the secret method and searched the cultivation world, finally finding Azure Sun罡Essence, formed from the descent of Heavenly罡Qi, on a mountain, which was now the Azure Sun Demonic Sect's mountain gate.</p><p>Overjoyed, this person established the sect based on this discovery.</p><p>Although the Azure Sun Demonic Sect wasn't as prosperous as it once was, it was still a powerful force in the Severed Sky Mountains, especially its mountain gate formation, which even Nascent Soul cultivators were reluctant to provoke.</p><p>After learning about Boundless Valley in the Azure Sun Demonic Sect, Qin Sang understood why Wandering Cloud had chosen to meet there.</p><p>Due to the presence of the ferocious and bloody baleful qi within Boundless Valley, its entrance was perpetually shrouded in blood miasma.</p><p>The blood miasma was not only highly toxic but also extremely cold. Cultivators didn't dare to directly resist the blood miasma with spiritual power and had to find other methods.</p><p>The Azure Sun Demonic Fire of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect happened to be somewhat effective against the blood miasma. The Azure Sun Demonic Sect refined a wisp of demonic fire into talismans and sold them to cultivators entering Boundless Valley as the best form of protection.</p><p>Although it was a demonic market, it wasn't much different from the markets Qin Sang had seen before. The cultivators within the market all followed the rules set by the Azure Sun Demonic Sect and wouldn't resort to fighting at the drop of a hat.</p><p>He had already taken off the black coffin, waiting for Wandering Cloud.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang also strolled around Azure Sun Market, focusing on understanding the demonic sects that specialized in corpse refinement, hoping to find some clues, but he didn't find any demonic sect related to the Heavenly Corpse Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the courtyard he had rented, cultivated for a while, and awoke from meditation, frowning slightly.  The appointed time was almost upon them, but Wandering Cloud hadn't appeared.</p><p>Could he have been delayed by something?</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly sensed someone triggering the restriction at his door.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression became alert.  A sweep of his divine sense revealed that the person outside was Wandering Cloud. Overjoyed, he quickly rose and welcomed Wandering Cloud in.</p><p>"I followed the mark left by Brother Qin.  I apologize for making you wait, Brother Qin. Please forgive me!"</p><p>Wandering Cloud looked travel-worn, suggesting he hadn't rested along the way.</p><p>He entered the courtyard and apologized to Qin Sang, "I immediately began preparations after returning to my sect. Unfortunately, one essential item was extremely difficult to refine. I failed twice, almost exhausting my materials, before finally succeeding.  It was a close call! A close call!"</p><p>"It's good that Senior has prepared everything..."</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't actually waited long, and these days in Azure Sun Market weren't wasted.</p><p>The two entered the room and sat down.</p><p>As soon as Wandering Cloud sat down, he asked, "Brother Qin, how long have you been here? You should know the use of the Azure Sun Demonic Fire, right?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and took out two jade pendants from his storage pouch.</p><p>"I bought two of the highest quality. I wonder if they're enough?"</p>
