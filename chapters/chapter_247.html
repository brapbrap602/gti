**Chapter 240 - Humanoid Specters**

Qin Sang has been on alert when, at the same time Dai Yue shouted out his warning, the Ebony Sword and Heavenly Toxin 紗揪 dragged out the beings hiding in the shadows.
A sword light suddenly shot through this place, an eerie shriek sounding out, and in front of the sword light, an extremely illusory humanoid shape appeared, pierced by the Ebony Sword and violently shaking before shattering into a clump of flames.
Sure enough, Fire Spirit Beasts were hiding in wait!
However, they were not firebirds or flying monkeys for Qin Sang and Yu Dai Yue to see with their own eyes. Instead, like ghosts, they were extremely concealed. If it had not been for the Poison Mist coming into contact with them, they would not have realized it ahead of time.
The moment after, the fog in front of them began to move and undulate, with innumerable humanoid specters slowly emerging and blocking their path, staring at them with eyes full of hatred. Because the facial features of the humanoid specters were even more human, they seemed even more terrifying than the flying monkeys.
‘Swoosh! Swoosh! ......’
In the blink of an eye, innumerable humanoid specters charged towards them. Yu Dai Yue’s arm swung around, throwing out a black Profound Umbrella. The Profound Umbrella’s light shone brilliantly and instantly expanded to form a gigantic black shield in front of them.
What was astonishing was that the humanoid specters were actually completely able to ignore the existence of this shield, easily passing through the Profound Umbrella’s obstruction!
“Not good!”
Yu Dai Yue was shocked, “They can completely ignore defensive magic tools!”
“Break through!”
Seeing that Yu Dai Yue’s Profound Umbrella was useless, Qin Sang gave up the idea of using defensive magic tools. Clearing a path with the Ebony Sword, his body flashed forward. Based on the experience he had gained before, the best way to deal with this situation was to charge forward without stopping, absolutely not letting themselves be surrounded.
Although the humanoid specters were capable of strange abilities, they were even more fragile than firebirds. He could put off defense and use the killing instead.
However, after charging forward for a while, they fell into a never-ending siege, just like before.
Yu Dai Yue seemed to have already used up all his means. Roaring continuously, there was nothing he could do, and the two of them became slower and slower.
Seeing this, Qin Sang had no choice but to take out the Ruyi Jade Symbol Treasure, solemnly saying, “Senior Brother Yu, help me protect the Dharma ......”
......
Before his eyes, everything immediately grew dark. Qin Sang only felt his body lighten and then suddenly sink, his feet stepping on solid ground. When he opened his eyes again, the fog in front of him was already gone and in front of him was instead an extremely bright space.
This ought to be the ancient Immortal’s Cave Mansion, right?
He felt secretly relieved that he had finally passed the trial.
He was standing under a gigantic shadow. Subconsciously, he looked all around with a vigilant gaze. He then looked up, staring at the abnormally tall stone tablet for a long time.
It was the same as the ancient tablet at the entrance, all black throughout, with mottled scars left by the years, but there were no words or pictures whatsoever, making it impossible to find any clues on the stone tablet to speculate about the origins of this ancient Immortal’s Cave Mansion.
Qin Sang detected the remnants of several auras. It seemed there were quite a few people who had entered the ancient Immortal’s Mansion before them. It seemed like some of them had even taken a moment to rest their energies under the stone tablet, but now, not a single person could be seen.
Not having discovered any traces of danger yet, the mansion seemed extremely peaceful, without being occupied by formidable妖兽. Even more值得庆幸, there was not a sea of Fire Spirit Beasts.
Only then did Qin Sang’s mind slightly relax and he looked around at the view.
The sky was completely clear with not a single cloud. There was virtually no fog blocking the view. Looking into the distance, the boundaries of the ancient cultivator’s mansion still could not be seen. This ancient cultivator’s mansion was much larger than they had imagined.
Ridge upon ridge of mountains spread out as far as the eye could see. The mountains undulated up and down, and on top of some of the mountain peaks could be vaguely seen the outlines of houses and halls. Qin Sang also saw a streak of light escaping from a stone hall before disappearing into the depths of the mountains.
This had to be one of the people who had arrived before them. He didn’t know how many treasures that person had acquired.
This space did not seem to be a simple ancient cultivator’s mansion. It was more like the location of an ancient sect or a place where many ancient cultivators lived together.
The stone tablet seemed to be the center of the entire space. It extended out infinitely in all directions, but to the extreme west there were four sky-pillar like peaks shooting straight into the clouds. They were the most striking and special place in the mansion, an extremely obvious landmark.
That place was very likely the core forbidden area of the ancient Immortal’s mansion!
The four peaks were extremely similar, the true ancient cultivator’s cave府 dwelling probably only existed on one of them, and the rest were used to mislead visitors. This kind of arrangement similar to a tomb was not unusual.
Of course, it was also possible that all four mountains were cave府 dwellings, but they were too far away. Standing outside, it was simply impossible to see what was on those four mountains.
That kind of place was not somewhere where Foundation Building cultivators like them could casually rush into. Qin Sang only guessed about it in his mind for a bit before looking away. He did not plan on personally risking his life.

Qin took more care to observe what he could do. He noticed that the temperature inside the ancient tomb was much higher than he had imagined. It was scorching hot, and it would be quite difficult for mortals to survive in this environment.

He then sniffed, and the strange and pungent smell instantly made him wrinkle his brows. He had also discovered that the plants in the ancient tomb were extremely strange as well.

As far as eyes could see, there were ordinary trees and grass. Tall and short trees formed dense primeval forests. The tall ones were as tall as mountain peaks, and the short ones looked like shrubs. The boundless weeds were withered and yellow, devoid of any trace of greenery.

The gentle breeze carried the rustling of withered weeds, providing a desolate and dreary atmosphere.

Although the trees were crooked and their barks were cracked, looking completely dry, these plants were still tenaciously alive, furnishing the ancient tomb with a carpet of withered yellow color.

Qin pondered to himself, could this be a result of underground magma flow?

During the trial, he had witnessed the momentum of a magma river with his own eyes. It was highly possible that there was boundless magma flowing under the ancient tomb, and that it had rushed into the magma river before being separated into two spaces by the stone tablet through some restriction.

This magma river would keep flowing outside the ancient immortal tomb, connecting with the outside world. He just didn’t know where it was in the outside world.

After all, so-called secret realms and ancient tombs were simply real spaces sealed by powerful cultivators through enchantment or restriction as covert places, rather than a small new world created out of thin air.

The powerful magic of opening up a small world only existed in legends.

Their discovery of the entrance to the ancient tomb here only meant that the owner of the tomb had placed the entrance here. The actual location of the tomb could be here or somewhere else.

While Qin secretly pondered, Yu was also looking around with a contemplative face, seemingly contemplating which direction he should go. Aside from the west, all three other directions seemed to be similar.

After pondering for a moment, Yu turned and said to Qin, “Junior Brother Qin, which direction do you plan on going? Shall we continue to search for treasure together?”

Qin and Yu were standing quite a distance apart. Qin slightly shook his head and said, “Senior Brother Yu, I’ve used up a lot of my spiritual force. This place is still relatively safe, so I’d like to recover my spiritual sea before setting out. I won’t delay you.”

In order to break through the obstruction of the human-shaped spirit, Qin had used the Ru Yi Fu treasure talisman once.

There might be hidden dangers lurking in the seemingly peaceful ancient tomb, and he didn’t want to recklessly go on an adventure in his current state.
