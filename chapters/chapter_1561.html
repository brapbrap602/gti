<h1></h1><p>The journey was uneventful.</p><p>Nearing the Chi’nan Island Chain, Qin Sang suppressed his cultivation to the Golden Core realm and followed behind Zhou and Ruan.</p><p>The Chi’nan Island Chain was originally an unremarkable place, considered a remote area of the East Sea, inhabited only by low-level cultivators.  Only recently had it become bustling with activity.</p><p>Golden Core cultivators, rarely seen on ordinary days, had been frequently appearing in the Chi’nan Island Chain, making the local cultivators tremble with fear.</p><p>Rumors were still fermenting.</p><p>When Qin Sang and the other two arrived, the number of cultivators drawn to the Chi’nan Island Chain wasn't overwhelming yet, with most still on their way.</p><p>After landing on the islands, Zhou and Ruan, familiar with the area, found a market on one of the islands in the Chi’nan Chain, made contact with local factions, and gathered information.</p><p>Qin Sang initially followed them, then wandered around the market alone, observing the coming and going cultivators.</p><p>Many cultivators were clearly from outside, and their cultivation levels weren't weak.  Zhou Jin's cultivation was only considered average among them.</p><p>Some were definitely here to try their luck.</p><p>But Qin Sang believed that a large portion were scouts sent by various factions.  With the whereabouts of Sage Huiguang and True Monarch Danyu remaining a mystery, every faction was eager to confirm or debunk the news.</p><p>The market was a mix of all sorts, but no disturbances had occurred yet. After all, everyone knew they were here to gather information and wouldn't act recklessly, lest they offend a powerful faction, and their own sects might not be able to protect them.</p><p>After walking for a while, Qin Sang didn't sense the presence of any Nascent Soul cultivators.  Few were as personally involved as he was.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, wait!"</p><p>Zhou Jin's call came from behind.</p><p>Qin Sang pretended not to have noticed earlier, turned his head at the sound, and saw Zhou and Ruan walking towards him quickly, followed by three strangely dressed cultivators.</p><p>"Why did you walk so far? We couldn't extend our divine sense in the city and had a hard time finding you!"</p><p>Zhou Jin complained.</p><p>"Weren't we supposed to meet at the inn tonight?"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned confusion, his gaze falling on the three behind them. "Who are these three?"</p><p>The trio consisted of two men and one woman.</p><p>The older man and woman were both at the Golden Core realm, while the younger man was around Ruan Yu's age.</p><p>Their attire was drastically different from ordinary cultivators, even in the East Sea, very unique.</p><p>Each of them had eight or ten colorful cloth bags hanging from their waists. The bags were adorned with complex patterns and flickering restrictions, but they didn't look like magical artifacts or spatial pouches.</p><p>Moreover, the pockets on their clothes were bulging, and it was unknown what they contained.</p><p>Even Foundation Establishment cultivators rarely carried so many things on them. They likely possessed a special divine ability.</p><p>Zhou Jin gestured with his hand, smiling. "Let me introduce everyone! Fellow Daoist Qin, these three are the Leng Siblings, incredibly skilled and righteous. We met three years ago in the north, and unexpectedly encountered them here. Fellow Daoists, this is the Fellow Daoist Qin I mentioned earlier.  We've traveled together from Bieli Island to this point and are all well-acquainted friends."</p><p>"It's a pleasure! A pleasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed his hands in greeting.</p><p>The Leng Siblings returned the greeting with a peculiar hand gesture.</p><p>"The three of us don't deserve the title 'Siblings'. It's just something outsiders have forced upon us, a laughingstock! Fellow Daoist Qin's aura is like an abyss, profound and unfathomable.  Like Fellow Daoists Zhou and Ruan, you must hail from a righteous Immortal Sect, truly enviable,"  the older man, named Leng Qi, chuckled, his voice hoarse and grating.</p><p>Like the hiss of a venomous snake, exceptionally unpleasant.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over his throat, pondering silently.</p><p>These three were likely not actual siblings.  Their auras were peculiar, neither Buddhist nor Daoist, but without any hint of disorder.  They most likely had an inheritance.  He wondered which sect they belonged to.</p><p>Listening to Zhou Jin's further explanation, Qin Sang learned that the Leng Siblings were also attracted by the legends of the ancient Immortal Sect.  They arrived a few days earlier and had already gathered some information.</p><p>Seeing the increasing number of experts in the Chi’nan Island Chain, the three decided to venture out to sea quickly to gain an advantage. They were recruiting companions and happened to encounter Zhou and Ruan.</p><p>"I trust Fellow Daoist Zhou's character. With the assistance of the three of you, we should be assured of success.  What are your thoughts, Fellow Daoist Qin?  We haven't heard of anyone finding the ancient Immortal Sect yet. If we are truly fortunate enough, we'll each rely on our own abilities then."</p><p>Leng Qi spoke confidently, extending the invitation directly.</p><p>As he spoke, Leng Qi didn't try to hide anything, directly taking out a jade slip and handing it to Qin Sang. "Fellow Daoist, please take a look. This is the information we've gathered. We haven't found any ruins of an ancient Immortal Sect, but it's not entirely without discoveries. The legends about immortals in the Chi’nan Island Chain are clearly more prevalent than elsewhere, and quite unique. There must be a reason for this…"</p><p>The jade slip not only contained various legends but also a sea chart of the Chi’nan Island Chain's vicinity, marking several islands that warranted closer inspection.</p><p>Leng Qi was very generous.</p><p>Before Qin Sang agreed to join them, he revealed the information they painstakingly collected.</p><p>After reading the jade slip, Qin Sang considered for a moment and accepted the invitation.</p><p>Leng Qi was overjoyed, his attitude noticeably warmer.</p><p>That night, Leng Qi arranged their accommodations at the inn.</p><p>At noon on the third day, Qin Sang and the other two arrived at the docks as agreed and easily located a treasure ship.</p><p>Sensing the auras on the ship from afar, Qin Sang scoffed inwardly.  On such a small ship, there were no fewer than twenty Golden Core cultivators gathered.</p><p>Even in the flourishing cultivation world of Zhongzhou, such a scene was rare, let alone in the East Sea.</p><p>Leng Qi led the three of them onto the treasure ship, immediately attracting scrutinizing gazes, which were then quickly withdrawn.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed oblivious, leading Zhou and Ruan to a round table and sitting down.</p><p>Others attempted to strike up conversations, which Zhou Jin handled.</p><p>Qin Sang leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes and resting, extending his spiritual sense. He didn't detect any Nascent Soul cultivator auras, nor did he feel observed.</p><p>After waiting for a while, more people boarded the ship.</p><p>When the sun was high in the sky, Leng Qi entered the cabin and announced their departure. The treasure ship shuddered slightly, sailing out of the dock.</p><p>After the initial unfamiliarity, the cultivators in the cabin quickly warmed up to each other.</p><p>However, everyone tacitly avoided inquiring about each other's backgrounds.</p><p>With so many Golden Core cultivators gathered, few things posed a threat to them. Everyone appeared relaxed, chatting about everything under the heavens, especially when mentioning the ancient Immortal Sect ruins. Their eyes lit up, as if they were genuinely searching for an ancient Immortal Sect.</p><p>Leaving the Chi’nan Island Chain, the islands became noticeably sparser.</p><p>Leng Qi personally steered the ship, following the planned route, searching one island after another.</p><p>At each location, Qin Sang personally disembarked.</p><p>As expected, these seemingly plausible legends were almost entirely unreliable. There were only desolate islands, with no trace of any ancient Immortal Sect.</p><p>Experiencing repeated disappointments, everyone's enthusiasm gradually waned.</p><p>…</p><p>On this day.</p><p>Their journey was more than halfway complete.</p><p>The treasure ship sped across the sea, leaving a white trail in its wake.</p><p>Leng Qi noticed Qin Sang and Zhou and Ruan standing at the ship's railing, his curiosity piqued. He walked over, about to inquire.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard Qin Sang shout, "Below!"</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Zhou Jin's hands moved swiftly, a streak of light shooting from his hand, vanishing into the sea in a flash.</p><p>Immediately following, with a ‘splash’, the streak of light returned. It was a jade ring-shaped magical treasure, and inside it was trapped a bizarre fish demon!</p>
