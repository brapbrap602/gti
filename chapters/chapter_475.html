<h1>Chapter 468: The Hidden Moon Landscape Painting</h1><p>Chapter 468: The Hidden Moon Landscape Painting</p><p>The leader of the Yuan Shen Sect hadn't arrived, but these three weren't to be underestimated. The handsome young man was at least at the False Core stage, while the elder and the man in ordinary clothes were undoubtedly Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He couldn't tell if Granny Jing had deliberately dragged him into this, or if it was just a coincidence—they had arrived just as the three from the Yuan Shen Sect entered.</p><p>Qin Sang preferred to believe Granny Jing's involvement was unintentional.</p><p>Having encountered the three from the Yuan Shen Sect, he couldn't possibly stay out of it.  Not only had the Elder Zhangxing already set his sights on killing him, but if even one of these three escaped alive, Qin Sang would have no way to defend himself.</p><p>Being at odds with a Nascent Soul cultivator and the Yuan Shen Sect, one of the Eight Great Righteous Sects, was a terrible prospect.  </p><p>He might even be branded a traitor by the entire Xiaohan Domain for secretly colluding with Granny Jing to enter the Zhitian Peak.</p><p>Any of these outcomes would be unbearable for Qin Sang.</p><p>It seemed there was only one choice left…</p><p>"Who are you, to dare speak so disrespectfully to the Sect Leader?!"</p><p>Elder Zhangxing roared, his face icy as he glared at Granny Jing.</p><p>The two young men beside him were equally furious, about to attack, but Elder Zhangxing stopped them with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Granny Jing's tone and demeanor clearly indicated hostile intent, giving Elder Zhangxing a bad feeling and putting him on high alert.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered secretly. Granny Jing was so mysterious, and Elder Zhangxing didn't recognize her. Could she truly be a Nascent Soul cultivator?</p><p>He wondered what grudge Granny Jing held against Leng Yuntian, that she would risk her life and go to such lengths to infiltrate Zhitian Peak for an assassination.</p><p>Granny Jing's eyebrows swept lightly. Ignoring Elder Zhangxing's interrogation and the handsome young man, her gaze fell on the elder and the man in ordinary clothes. She said calmly, "Elder Zhangxing, Yu Shan Ting, two elders of the Yuan Shen Sect, Leng Yuntian's right and left hands. Since you are so loyal to Leng Yuntian, repaying his sins on his behalf shouldn't cause you any resentment…"</p><p>"Arrogant!"</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>The three from the Yuan Shen Sect shouted angrily.</p><p>Elder Zhangxing's white hair danced wildly, his silver robe billowing as a hurricane erupted around him. He soared into the air amid the flying sand and stones, transforming into a small expanse of starry sky, stars blazing brilliantly.</p><p>The robe was clearly a magical treasure, though from his position at the edge of the square, Qin Sang couldn't discern its grade.  This was because Elder Zhangxing's cultivation was suppressed to the False Core stage, preventing him from unleashing the treasure's full power.</p><p>Even so, the robe was not to be trifled with. The starry sky enveloped the entire square, leaving no gaps, but it didn't touch the restrictions outside the square.</p><p>Elder Zhangxing, a renowned Golden Core cultivator in the late stages of the Golden Core realm, surely possessed extensive combat experience. He knew better than to provoke the outer restrictions.</p><p>With the starry sky manifested, Elder Zhangxing pointed towards the heavens, manipulating the stars.</p><p>In an instant, countless starlight blazed, converging into a brilliant pillar of light that descended from the sky with boundless killing intent, about to fall upon Granny Jing.</p><p>A glimpse was enough.</p><p>This wasn't Qin Sang's first time witnessing a battle between Golden Core cultivators, but few displayed Elder Zhangxing's effortless grace. His true strength was undoubtedly formidable.</p><p>On the other side, the man in ordinary clothes, Yu Shan Ting, his face ashen, had a bronze bell suspended above his head. Purple energy swirled within the bell, its exterior flickering with yellow light, complementing the starlight.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The purple energy within the bell churned violently, followed by a deafening roar.  The sound alone could shake the mind, causing Qin Sang's heart to jolt violently, making him feel slightly nauseous.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The bell's sound produced visible sonic waves, surging forth along with a torrent of purple energy, forming massive waves that clashed with the pillar of light conjured by Elder Zhangxing.</p><p>Although their cultivation was suppressed to the False Core stage, they were not restricted in their use of magical treasures, even if their power was greatly diminished; they remained superior to magical weapons.</p><p>Compared to them, the sword energy released by the handsome young man was insignificant, completely overshadowed by the two magical treasures.</p><p>Faced with this triple assault, Granny Jing's eyes remained calm. She extended a jade finger, lightly pointing upwards. A painted scroll flew from her fingertip.</p><p>The scroll spun rapidly, growing larger and larger until it reached three feet in length, slowly unfurling in mid-air.</p><p>A painting of a landscape with a hidden moon appeared before them.</p><p>The scroll depicted a vast landscape, the artistry exquisite, capturing the essence of the scene.  Clouds and mist shrouded the mountains and rivers, and amidst the endless expanse of clouds, a single moon was visible.</p><p>However, unlike the bright disc of the moon in the night sky, this was a subtle, hidden moon, rendered with simple strokes, almost impossible to clearly see.</p><p>The sun had not yet set, the moon just beginning to rise.</p><p>The seemingly insignificant Hidden Moon suddenly blazed with brilliant light as the scroll unfolded to its limit.  Transforming into a true moon, it detached from the scroll and ascended gracefully.</p><p>The moon blocked Huang Zhong's attack, withstanding the falling starlight, soaring upwards until it was embedded in the night sky formed by Yin Pao's shifting robes.</p><p>At this moment, the moon became the focal point, overshadowing countless stars.</p><p>"Who are you?!"</p><p>The Star-Holding Elder's eyes widened in shock, his question urgent.</p><p>Jing Po ignored him, producing a wooden carving from her left hand.</p><p>"Leeeet!"</p><p>A clear cry pierced the air. A Azure Bird sprang from Jing Po's palm, its wings beating as it darted towards the elegant young man's sword energy.  It unleashed a jet of azure energy, meeting the sword energy head-on, causing both to dissipate.</p><p>The Azure Bird accelerated, its speed resembling a released arrow, directly targeting the elegant young man.</p><p>Noticing the unusual nature of the Azure Bird, Yu Shan Ting moved to shield the elegant young man. Huang Zhong vibrated again; its resonant bell tone unleashed a ferocious beast, resembling a Qilin, from the purple energy.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The beast roared in fury.</p><p>Within the purple sound waves, the beast shimmered in and out of existence, almost merging with the sound waves of the Huang Zhong, creating a wave three times stronger than before, instantly attacking the Azure Bird.</p><p>The Azure Bird raised its proud head, its bright eyes flashing with disdain.  With a beat of its wings, it vanished, leaving only traces of azure light.</p><p>The next moment, the Azure Bird appeared above the beast's head, its talons extended, tearing through the beast's skull.</p><p>With a whimper, the beast died instantly, its arrogant roar cut short. Its body convulsed before dissipating along with the surrounding sound waves.</p><p>Unrelenting, the Azure Bird, swift as lightning, changed its target, attacking Yu Shan Ting.</p><p>Yu Shan Ting's expression darkened. He swiftly performed a complex hand seal, causing Huang Zhong to spin, launching three streams of purple energy this time.</p><p>Instead of transforming into a beast, the energy solidified into three purple blades, radiating killing intent, slicing towards the Azure Bird's neck.</p><p>Simultaneously, Yu Shan Ting glared at Jing Po and shouted to the elegant young man, "I'll deal with this demonic bird. Go assist the Grand Elder!"</p><p>The elegant young man was the weakest among them, far inferior to the three masters. However, since everyone was restricted to the Foundation Establishment stage, his support could still make a difference, distracting the opponents.</p>
