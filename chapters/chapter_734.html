<h1>Chapter 726: Tribulation of Love</h1><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with a strange light.</p><p>Ran Luo, however, remained composed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a little suspicious; she didn't seem to be threatening him.</p><p>Even if she were, Qin Sang wasn't afraid.</p><p>Hiding in the Demon Sea was easy enough. Most of the inner sea was occupied by humans. Even if the Black Snake Mountain was powerful, they couldn't run wild in human territory.</p><p>As long as he wasn't in the Wu Shen Continent, there was nothing to worry about.</p><p>"No wonder those people were so strong, they were actually the direct disciples of the Wu Clan's Yuan Ying stage. Luckily, my escape technique is decent, and I managed to escape the pursuit.  I am deeply grateful for Daoist Friend Ran and Elder Zou's help."</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and bowed.</p><p>Ran Luo smiled slightly, "Daoist Priest, please don't be so formal.  Those of different races often have different hearts.  Since you are a guest of the Chamber of Commerce, we couldn't possibly ignore it.  Elder Zou's suggestion…what are your thoughts?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, "I have two requests."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang was willing to cooperate, Ran Luo's face lit up, "Please, Daoist Priest."</p><p>"First, the matter of the spirit herbs can't wait. I must go and collect them first. Second, Daoist Friend Ran also knows how dangerous the Seven Killing Hall is. I dare not be careless and need to find a place to cultivate diligently. I need to strive to break through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage before the Seven Killing Hall opens, thus increasing my chances of survival. My cultivation technique is special, requiring frequent hunting of demonic beasts to comprehend the Dao of Slaughter, making it difficult for me to spare enough energy to handle the Chamber of Commerce's affairs..."</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly.</p><p>"Daoist Priest's talent is truly extraordinary, to be so confident in breaking through before the Seven Killing Hall opens."</p><p>Ran Luo couldn't help but exclaim.  She had been stuck at a bottleneck for ten years and still hadn't made any headway. Seeing Qin Sang's confident tone, she felt envious.</p><p>"Your cultivation progress is good for our Chamber of Commerce. I naturally have no reason to stop you. Therefore, before the Seven Killing Hall opens, you can first take up residence on some small islands along the shipping lanes. Our Chamber of Commerce is just starting out in the inner sea, these small islands have limited tasks; you only need to deal with potential crises. The ordinary matters will be handled by others. However, the chaos of the Demon Sea is well-known to you. These islands aren't like Du Yan Island, security is difficult to guarantee. Once you accept, you won't be able to travel freely; you must be contactable at all times…"</p><p>Ran Luo took out a sea chart and spread it before Qin Sang.</p><p>Some small islands with unimportant outposts were marked on the shipping lanes.</p><p>But the Chamber of Commerce lacked manpower in the Demon Sea.  Apart from large islands like Du Yan Island, one person would be responsible for several smaller islands. Though the tasks were few, it was still quite laborious.</p><p>Ran Luo pointed at the sea chart, while Qin Sang focused on the surroundings of these islands, looking for suitable places to hunt demonic beasts.</p><p>"I'm afraid I can't handle so many islands alone. Could Daoist Friend Ran assign some people to me?"</p><p>Ran Luo smiled meaningfully, "If Daoist Priest can persuade other daoists, I have no objection."</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, falling into thought.</p><p>The two of them talked privately for a long time.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang boarded a ship heading towards Tian Wu Island, preparing to set off.  The Wang sisters came to see him off.</p><p>They would take a ship to Da Huang Island the following night to make arrangements at Qin Sang's chosen location.  Qin Sang would meet up with them after collecting the six-petal butterfly violet.</p><p>Among the cultivators on Du Yan Island, aside from Ran Luo, Qin Sang only knew the Wang sisters. After obtaining Ran Luo's agreement, Qin Sang went to speak to the sisters.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the two sisters, who had originally planned an outing with a companion, agreed without hesitation after hearing Qin Sang's request, seemingly without even listening to the details.</p><p>Their relationship with the Chamber of Commerce was that of an employer and employee, and the Chamber of Commerce didn't have much control over them.  Ran Luo had no reason, nor would she, to stop them.</p><p>With the two sisters assisting him, things would be much easier.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't mistreat them. The older Wang sister had recently broken through to the Nascent Soul stage and was helping her younger sister gather Demonic Beast Pills; she didn’t even have a treasure weapon, her strength being among the lowest amongst Nascent Soul cultivators.  Qin Sang lent her the Green Jade Scepter so she could maintain stability.</p><p>Qin Sang gave the Wang sisters a few instructions before boarding the ship.</p><p>The Wang sisters waved farewell.</p><p>Watching the ship sail into the distance.</p><p>The younger sister playfully peeked in front of her elder sister, "Congratulations, elder sister! You finally got your wish!"</p><p>The elder sister glared at her younger sister, spat, and feigned a strike, "Don't talk nonsense, or I'll cut out your tongue!"</p><p>The younger sister, unafraid, hopped and skipped, waving her hands.  "Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Still pretending!  Who was it that agreed without even hearing the whole story, or asking my opinion?  Like they were afraid someone would change their mind…  Were they practically flying on air with excitement?"</p><p>"We haven't even seen this Daoist's face,"</p><p>the older sister interjected, unexpectedly.</p><p>The younger sister froze, looking at her sister's expression, unable to continue her playful antics.</p><p>The older sister chuckled self-deprecatingly. "I never thought I’d become a centuries-old hag, suddenly experiencing girlish feelings.  I don't know where it came from.  Perhaps it's because all those years in the demon sea, adrift and barely surviving, I yearned for support.  When I met the Daoist, it was an involuntary, sudden eruption. Reflecting on it, I realize it may not be love."</p><p>The younger sister listened quietly, moving closer to hug her sister's arm.</p><p>The older sister patted her shoulder, whispering, "This may not be a bad thing. Understanding this has significantly improved my state of mind. Let's consider it a trial of love. The Daoist's power is immeasurable, and he's righteous.  His willingness to help us is a great blessing.  Your demon-killing pill will surely work.  Hurry and achieve the Core Formation stage, so we can walk the immortal path together, forever."</p><p>"We'll never be separated," the younger sister murmured.</p><p>…</p><p>On the large ship,</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware of the sisters' conversation.</p><p>He held a token, signifying his position as a manager for the Qiongyu Trading Company.</p><p>Joining the company – whether it's good or bad remains to be seen – but for a chance at entering the Seven Killing Hall, he had no choice.</p><p>Before departing, Qin Sang traded all the demon pills and other items in his storage ring for spirit stones, barely enough to secure a spot in the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>As for the East Pole Alliance's mission, he'd deal with it when the time came.</p><p>If the mission proved extremely dangerous, Qin Sang certainly wouldn't blindly accept it.</p><p>The ship sailed smoothly across the sea. Protected by spirit arrays and guarded by numerous powerful cultivators, there was little to worry about.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the room's restriction, adding several more layers of protection before taking a jade box from his storage ring.</p><p>He opened the box, and a brilliant blue light filled the room, casting a blue glow on his face.</p>
