<h1>Chapter 2058: Sun Disc Sweeps the Heavens</h1><p>A single strike of the Reverse Five Elements Divine Light pierced through Queli's chest.  Even the silver scales manifested by her clan's secret technique couldn't withstand it.  Its power far surpassed Queli's imagination.</p><p>She could clearly feel a destructive force spreading within her body, her life force rapidly draining away.  Her eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>However, the silver scales were ultimately able to resist some of the power, acting as a buffer.  The destructive force didn't fully erupt, giving Queli a brief respite.</p><p>She knew that a tempestuous attack would surely follow, leaving her no chance to suppress the destructive force.  Making a decisive move, the silver scales on her neck shimmered, transforming into a blade-like aura that decapitated her!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Queli's head separated from her body, abandoning her torso as it soared into the sky.</p><p>The silver scales on her torso immediately vanished, completely losing their defensive capabilities.  Under the impact of the Five Elements Divine Light's destructive force, it instantly turned to ashes.</p><p>The small figure in the distance felt a chill run down his spine as he witnessed this scene.  His true body had just been destroyed.  Fortunately, the Divine Light hadn't been directed at him, otherwise, he would have had no chance of survival.  He had to admit that both he and Queli had been too arrogant, treating their opponent as an ordinary cultivator of the same realm, which gave the enemy the opportunity to defeat them one by one.</p><p>The opponent's current display might not even be their full strength. Though appearing to be at the early stage of Void Refinement, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to treat them as a late-stage Void Refinement powerhouse. Had they known this earlier, they would have been extremely cautious and wouldn't have ended up in such a predicament.</p><p>Seeing that Queli hadn't perished on the spot and was still struggling, a flicker of hesitation flashed in the small figure's eyes.  With a hardened resolve, he abruptly stopped, silently chanted an incantation, and released an obscure ripple.</p><p>Only by saving Queli and combining their two clans' divine abilities could they have any hope of survival!</p><p>Queli's head was desperately trying to escape, her face covered in blood, looking utterly miserable.  Just then, she suddenly felt a subtle tremor in the void.  Realizing something, a glimmer of hope appeared in her eyes.</p><p>Immediately afterward, an invisible vortex appeared in the void, leading to an unknown destination. It unexpectedly sucked Queli's head inside, vanishing without a trace.</p><p>The next moment, an identical vortex emerged in the void before the small figure.  A shadowy mass floated out, revealing Queli's head.</p><p>Having cast this secret technique, the small figure looked exhausted and quickly transmitted a few words.  Queli abruptly opened her eyes, her mouth gaping wide as she swallowed the small figure whole.  Then, she transformed into a streak of silver light and fled into the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang watched all of this, secretly sighing in admiration. The Otherfolk's divine abilities were truly wondrous. This woman had abandoned her torso, leaving only her head, yet her life force hadn't diminished much.  Flesh buds were already wriggling on her neck, and given time, it wouldn't be difficult for her to grow a new body.</p><p>With their divine abilities complementing each other, they would be difficult to eliminate.  If there were no further interruptions, Qin Sang had a good chance of slaying them both if he pursued them.</p><p>However, the stone stele descended from the heavens, hurtling towards Qin Sang, bringing with it an astonishing pressure.  Just now, he had forcibly used the Five Elements Crown under the stele's pressure, which was a risky move.</p><p>This stele weighed more than a mountain, as if it were about to crush the entire world beneath it. Yet, Qin Sang made an unexpected discovery. This stone stele didn't seem to be real but rather an illusion.</p><p>Startled, Qin Sang immediately realized that Elder Quan, who was far away, didn't possess the ability to teleport treasures across such vast distances. This stone stele was likely manifested through some kind of divine ability.</p><p>This stele must have a real counterpart in the physical world. The true treasure's power was definitely formidable.  Although this was an illusory stele, the pressure Qin Sang was enduring was entirely real, and it was being borne by both his Dharma Body and true body simultaneously.</p><p>The stele's power encompassed the entire void, enveloping both his Dharma Body and true body.  Moreover, both felt as though the stele was falling directly towards them, which was incredibly strange.</p><p>His vision was filled with only this stone stele.  The patterns on its surface seemed to come alive, like tentacles, trying to pull him into a dark unknown.  Ominous black tides surged from all directions.</p><p>The danger didn't end there. Qin Sang also felt a familiar sensation, reminiscent of his encounter with Island Master Meng. The feeling of being trapped like a beast in a cage, with his opponent controlling the very heavens and earth around him, was still vivid in his memory.</p><p>The Void Refinement realm, controlling heaven and earth.</p><p>Low-level cultivators facing Void Refinement cultivators were like prisoners in a celestial prison, with little to no power to resist, only able to surrender.  The higher the realm, the stronger the control over heaven and earth. It wasn't surprising that an early-stage Void Refinement cultivator would feel this way when facing a late-stage powerhouse.</p><p>Qin Sang had obtained Senior Tian Yue's sword light and had spent years comprehending the Sword Domain, gaining some understanding of the Law Domain that could only be grasped at the Body Integration realm.</p><p>In his view, reaching the Body Integration realm wasn't simply about controlling heaven and earth. Once the Law Domain unfolded, all power within its reach would become one's own.  Moreover, all power, including the enemy's, could be transformed into the power one desired!</p><p>Within the Law Domain, one was the sovereign. Everything within the Law Domain operated according to one's will. If the Law Domain were likened to a small world, then one would be the Heavenly Emperor of that world!</p><p>Qin Sang had only scratched the surface of the Sword Domain, so his understanding was naturally superficial. However, he could deduce the immense power of Body Integration cultivators based on this.</p><p>Late-stage Void Refinement cultivators were gradually approaching this level, not far from developing their own Law Domains.</p><p>This person might have already touched upon a sliver of its mysteries.</p><p>The stone stele wasn't merely an attack; it was also a conduit. The opponent was using it to project their will, and what was pressing down on him wasn't the stele itself, but a fragment of heaven and earth!</p><p>Void Refinement cultivators could contend with their enemies for control over the power of heaven and earth and wouldn't be completely helpless in such a situation. However, if it were any other early-stage Void Refinement cultivator, they would likely be struggling just to cope.</p><p>If he couldn't break free in time and was instead captured by the stele, once the opponent's true body arrived, there would be no chance of escape.</p><p>But Qin Sang couldn't be viewed as an ordinary cultivator.  He was merely a step away from mid-stage Void Refinement, and having had the opportunity to comprehend the Sword Domain shortly after entering Void Refinement, his perspective was far beyond that of others.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't deduce how far the opponent had progressed, but he could be certain that they hadn't comprehended a Law Domain, not even a rudimentary form of one.  Therefore, in his eyes, the opponent's move wasn't without flaws.</p><p>However, even if he perceived the flaws, he needed sufficient strength to exploit them, otherwise, he would still be unable to escape being suppressed by the stele.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned solemn, and he instantly made a decision.</p><p>He didn't look at the stone stele. His true body remained motionless, silently circulating his profound arts, his mind forming hand seals. The treasure seal was formed in an instant.</p><p>The seal Qin Sang was using at this moment was one of the Nine Bright Seals, the Sun Disc Seal!</p><p>The Sun Disc Seal could gather the power of his Dharma Body and Dharma Idol, transforming it into a golden sun and unleashing it simultaneously. It could be said to be his strongest technique currently.</p><p>Since his power had broken through to Void Refinement, Qin Sang hadn't encountered an enemy capable of forcing him to use the Sun Disc Seal.  Now, facing the pressure of a late-stage Void Refinement powerhouse, he had no choice but to unleash it.</p><p>In this moment, the power of his Dharma Idol rapidly depleted, and his Dharma Body, also motionless, immediately appeared somewhat illusory.</p><p>At the same time, a vast golden radiance swept across the heavens.  The golden light was dazzling, the golden waves boundless, dyeing the sky and sea a brilliant gold.</p><p>A great sun appeared in the sky, a golden disc hanging high.</p><p>Qin Sang stood beneath the golden disc, as if cloaked in a golden robe.  The black tides were instantly swept away.</p><p>The stone stele's descent abruptly slowed, its surface gleaming with golden light, as if plated with gold foil. It also seemed as though an immense force was firmly supporting it, preventing it from continuing its descent.</p><p>The golden light grew increasingly blinding, like countless golden needles. Under the golden radiance, the stone stele began to tremble violently.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>...</p><p>Each tremor created terrifying waves, churning the sea and causing islands and continents to collapse.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Finally, a corner of the stone stele cracked.</p><p>Cracks then spread across its surface.  In the blink of an eye, the stele shattered into several fragments, instantly vanishing into nothingness.</p><p>As the stele was destroyed, Elder Quan's will was also completely expelled.  Qin Sang suddenly felt lighter, regaining control over the surrounding heaven and earth as the pressure vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, sensing the power within his body.  He had entered Void Refinement many years ago, and now, using the Sun Disc Seal wouldn't drain him dry like it had in the Divine Court.</p><p>Under his precise control, the Sun Disc Seal had just barely managed to destroy the stone stele, and his internal power hadn't been completely exhausted.</p><p>His gaze shifted, looking across the vast distance towards the horizon.</p><p>The moment the stele was destroyed, Elder Quan felt a backlash, knowing that his divine ability had been broken by Qin Sang. His expression became incredibly grave.</p><p>With both Jiqiong and Queli's successive failures, he had anticipated this possibility, but he hadn't expected Qin Sang to handle it so effortlessly.</p><p>The anger in his heart vanished, because in his eyes, Qin Sang was no longer a petty scoundrel who only used schemes and tricks, but a worthy opponent!</p><p>Across the vast void, their eyes met.</p><p>Elder Quan's fighting spirit soared as he strode across the waves, swift as lightning.</p><p>A faint smile played on Qin Sang's lips.  He had just sensed that Su Nu and the Si You clansman were safe. He could withdraw now.</p><p>Glancing at the escaping Jiqiong and Queli, Qin Sang decided to abandon the pursuit.  Delaying any longer, even if he could slay them, the late-stage powerhouse would arrive.</p><p>Crippling them, rather than killing them, would actually tie up the opponent, which would be more advantageous to him.</p><p>Fighting spirit surged within Qin Sang's heart as well, but now wasn't the right time.  He wouldn't engage in pointless battles.</p><p>With his decision made, Qin Sang merged with his Dharma Body and laughed aloud, "Until we meet again!"</p><p>Then, his phoenix wings flapped powerfully. Secretly urging the Azure Phoenix True Thunder, he transformed into a streak of azure lightning, piercing through the sky and vanishing.</p><p>By the time Elder Quan arrived, he could only see a speck of azure light on the horizon.  He hovered above the sea, not pursuing, but simply gazing silently at the horizon.</p><p>Only then did Jiqiong and Queli dare to return, nervously saying, "We were no match for the opponent and allowed them to snatch the Si You clan's young master. We ask for Elder Quan's punishment."</p><p>They had narrowly escaped death, one transformed into a grotesque small figure, the other reduced to just a head, a truly miserable sight.</p><p>Faced with their plea for punishment, Elder Quan didn't reprimand them.</p><p>He had witnessed the enemy's strength with his own eyes.  These two hadn't held back; they truly weren't the enemy's match.</p><p>Seeing that Elder Quan had let the matter slide, both of them breathed a sigh of relief. Jiqiong said resentfully, "This person dared to interfere in our clan's internal affairs. Once we discover his identity, we will make him pay!"</p><p>"Human? Do you think he is human?" Elder Quan suddenly asked.</p><p>Jiqiong was stunned.</p><p>Queli pondered and said, "This person possesses a Dharma Body. Many of his techniques, especially his swordsmanship, are extremely refined, like a human sword cultivator.  But I sensed what seemed like the aura of a Dharma Idol within him.  And the demonic Qi that erupted later was exceptionally pure, along with those phoenix wings.  He likely has some connection to the demon race."</p><p>"What a mess. Could he be a half-demon?"</p><p>Jiqiong frowned, suddenly remembering something and looked at Elder Quan, "The Heavenly Division and the Eastern Sea Water Clan are secretly colluding. Could it be that they commissioned the demon race to send an expert to capture the Si You clan's young master?"</p><p>Elder Quan remained noncommittal.</p><p>At this moment, streaks of escaping light flew towards them, all clansmen they had brought to set up the formation.</p><p>These Otherfolk experts had witnessed the previous battle. Not only was their target snatched away, but two of their clan's powerhouses were also crippled.  They were all terrified, fearing they might incur punishment, standing cautiously to the side.</p><p>Soon, ripples appeared on the horizon. Ji Liang was leading his troops towards them, still unaware of the failure here.</p><p>Elder Quan and the others carefully searched the vicinity once more, but found no trace of Su Nu and the Si You clan's young master. They had no choice but to give up.</p><p>"Withdraw!"</p><p>Elder Quan took one last, long look in the direction Qin Sang had left, then summoned a cloud beneath his feet, carrying everyone away.</p><p>The intensity of this battle had far exceeded expectations.  The grand formation concealing spiritual energy couldn't hide it. The Haitang Academy was most likely already on its way, and they couldn't stay here any longer.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang flew for a while, sensing no pursuit behind him. Knowing that the Otherfolk had given up, he found an island reef, concealed his Qi, and then flew towards the open sea.</p><p>Su Nu had made proper arrangements, and they hadn't exposed their Qi, so escaping wouldn't be difficult. The only concern was that Qin Sang might be targeted by the Haitang Academy.  He would avoid them if possible. Once he escaped the Haitang Academy's territory, this trip could be considered a complete victory.</p><p>There were no rumors of Body Integration cultivators from the Haitang Academy making a move, but that didn't mean they didn't exist.  However, unless it was a matter of life and death, such a minor incident shouldn't alarm a Body Integration cultivator.</p><p>During his flight, Qin Sang clearly felt the atmosphere around him change. The Haitang Academy was likely searching for them.</p><p>He was as careful as possible, not alerting anyone. But as he got closer to the open sea, he didn't feel any sense of relief. Instead, a sense of urgency grew, as faint, inexplicable Qi swept past him, forcing Qin Sang to evade.</p><p>The Haitang Academy must have employed some kind of detection method. The restrictions on Qin Sang were increasing, and the space left for him was gradually shrinking.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang felt that he was about to be exposed.  However, the open sea was not far away. He ceased hiding and immediately transformed into lightning, flying away.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang felt powerful pressures closing in, attempting to form some kind of formation to trap him from a distance.  But Qin Sang's speed was too great.  Before they could encircle him, he had already escaped the Haitang Academy's territory. The restraints instantly vanished, and the sea and sky stretched wide open before him!</p><p>At the edge of the Haitang Academy's waters, a scholar appeared not long after Qin Sang's departure.</p><p>A moment later, another person appeared beside him.</p><p>"That person escaped?"</p><p>The scholar sighed, "His escape technique is truly extraordinary."</p><p>"It's only natural that someone capable of snatching prey from the jaws of those Otherfolk would have such strength," the person beside him said indifferently.</p><p>"What did Pavilion Master Zhao say?" the scholar asked.</p><p>"We've investigated.  Only a few islands and continents were lost, and those Otherfolk are willing to compensate."</p><p>The scholar nodded, seemingly understanding.</p><p>Then, both figures gradually faded away. ()</p>
