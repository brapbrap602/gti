<h1>Chapter 1906: Seclusion</h1><p>Magma churned, and muffled thunder rumbled from deep within the earth.</p><p>In the lake's center, magma surged upward, lifting the array fragments. Qin Sang received them, catching the stone peak as it fell into the lake of fire.</p><p>After being manipulated by Qin Sang, the array fragments were different from before; now they could better connect with the mountain protection array.</p><p>A portion of the stone peak was submerged beneath the magma, connected to the array fragments, standing in the fiery lake as a solitary peak—Qin Sang's new cultivation site.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, making some fine adjustments.  He retrieved various spiritual materials from the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Using his palm as a furnace, he directly refined the materials.  In a short time, he had forged a triangular treasure banner, followed by nineteen more.</p><p>These banners could form a spirit array called the "Shining Fire Array," a formation recorded in the "Chongxuan Record."  It could draw upon the underground fire veins, gather fire to create a furnace, and also serve as part of the mountain protection array—perfectly suited to this place.</p><p>One of the nineteen banners served as the main banner. Qin Sang flicked his wrist, and the main banner’s surface fluttered, emitting a radiant light, like a blazing fire, that shot towards the stone peak in the lake's center.</p><p>The main banner was planted atop the peak; its light subsided, disappearing from view.</p><p>The remaining eighteen banners also flew up, landing in various locations around the lake, following a specific pattern.</p><p>For a time, the flames roared to the heavens.</p><p>Violent chaos spread in all directions.  The earth shook, mountains shifted, and unseen changes occurred deep underground.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang activated the Four-part Serpent Seal, commanding the serpents to cease exhaling cold air.</p><p>The blocking ice mountains finally melted, and the pent-up magma, like untamed horses, surged forth, washing over the land and flowing into the magma lake.</p><p>It lasted for several hours before the magma showed signs of receding, returning to its riverbeds.</p><p>This area seemed to have undergone a cataclysmic transformation.</p><p>Countless magma rivers crisscrossed the land, resembling a vast fiery net radiating from the magma lake.</p><p>Underground, even more drastic changes had taken place.</p><p>The banners sank into the magma, completing the Shining Fire Array. The giant waves on the lake's surface suddenly calmed.</p><p>The stone peak in the lake's center disappeared, along with all traces of energy fluctuations.</p><p>Outsiders would only believe it was an eruption of the fire veins, causing such a scene. Even if they entered the magma lake, they would detect nothing unusual.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Four-part Serpent Seal and the Grey Sparrow Sword.</p><p>The surrounding light returned to normal. The fire spirits, freed from their restraints, regained consciousness, gazing at the unfamiliar world in bewilderment.</p><p>Those with low intelligence quickly forgot their worries and began to explore.</p><p>The more intelligent fire spirits were brought by Qin Sang into the magma lake, allowed to dwell there, adding life to the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the cultivation site he had personally created, a satisfied expression on his face, and stepped into the lake.</p><p>Minor fluctuations appeared in the void, and Qin Sang vanished.</p><p>Only the raging flames and the sound of churning magma remained.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the mountaintop, summoning the altar.  The altar's gate opened, and three streams of light flew out.</p><p>Gui Hou and Luo Hou, the two demonic cultivators, landed and knelt before Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed towards the mountain below, saying, "You two will choose a place to cultivate in the mountains from now on."</p><p>The two demons, being astute, immediately understood that Qin Sang had found his true cultivation site.  They had a clear understanding of their roles, and immediately replied respectfully, "We will certainly fulfill our duties and prevent any outsiders from entering the mountain to disturb Master's cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Go."</p><p>The two demons immediately took their leave, arriving at the foot of the mountain.  They separately carved out cave dwellings on the east and west sides.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A red thread continuously circled Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand, allowing the Fire Jade Centipede to land in his palm.  "You go too."</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede rubbed against Qin Sang's finger, transforming into a streak of red lightning, and disappeared into the magma lake.</p><p>He remembered first encountering the Fire Jade Centipede in the magma.</p><p>Now, the Fire Jade Centipede's cultivation remained at the peak of the fourth transformation.</p><p>If Qin Sang forcefully pushed it, he could help it break through. However, burning its potential was not as good as letting it breakthrough on its own; perhaps there was still a chance.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's cultivation was far behind.  The fourth or fifth transformation made little difference to Qin Sang.</p><p>He did not restrict the Fire Jade Centipede’s movements, allowing it to enter the bronze pillar space to cultivate, leaving its fate to chance.</p><p>A red thread circled the stone peak once, then gradually sank below.</p><p>Qin Sang's own cave dwelling, located on the mountaintop, was a simple, almost spartan stone chamber, nameless and unmarked.</p><p>He first went to the bottom to the remaining array fragments and placed Zhuque on the bronze pillar.</p><p>A small Zhuque bird, nestled in its wings, twitched its tiny body in its sleep, a contented expression on its face.  Qin Sang didn't wake it, returning instead to her own cave.</p><p>The cave contained two stone beds.  Qin Sang summoned her Five Elements Crown spirit, placing it opposite her.  She then fed a Yinghua Dan pill to her Sky Eye butterfly before sitting cross-legged.</p><p>Her breathing gradually evened out, and silence descended upon the cave.  After several cycles of cultivation, Qin Sang reviewed her techniques in her mind, focusing on filling the gaps from her late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>…</p><p>“Quick! Get it!”</p><p>A sharp cry echoed from upstream of a river of lava.  Bright flames flickered upstream; a small, entirely crimson deer was running wildly across the lava.</p><p>‘*Pat! Pat! Pat!*’</p><p>The deer’s hooves pounded the lava like raindrops, yet the intense heat didn't harm it.  A closer look revealed that the deer wasn’t solid; it was a fire spirit born from a fiery vein.</p><p>The deer fled in panic, its eyes filled with terror, pursued by a powerful enemy.  Before it could escape very far, a crimson streak shot across the sky from behind.</p><p>The streak was as fast as lightning.  Within the glow was a large golden-backed centipede, its thousands of legs moving rapidly, navigating the flames, looking fearsome.</p><p>On the centipede's back sat a small, red-feathered bird resembling a fire crow, its wing pointing ahead.  The seemingly unremarkable bird commanded the centipede, issuing orders with an air of authority.</p><p>The distance between them quickly narrowed. The centipede opened its mouth, about to spew a burst of flame.</p><p>“*Slap!*”</p><p>The fire crow slapped the centipede's back, shouting angrily, “You idiot!  Have you forgotten what I taught you?”</p><p>The centipede’s flame was instantly extinguished, nearly sending it tumbling into the lava.  It quickly regained its balance; a fall would result in a far worse beating from the bird.</p><p>With a whimper, the centipede’s thousands of legs moved, each foot tip glowing crimson, shooting thin threads of fire at the deer.  The fire threads covered the sky.</p><p>The deer desperately dodged, but couldn’t escape the fire’s range; a thread finally entangled it.</p><p>‘*Snap!*’</p><p>The deer's leg, caught in the thread, disintegrated into fire and returned to its source.  Thinking it had escaped, the deer was surprised to see the fire quickly reconstitute its leg only to find the thread still tightly wrapped around it. With a tug, it nearly fell.</p><p>The deer panicked, as more fire threads shot towards it. However, instead of attacking directly, these threads interconnected and intertwined around the deer, forming an intricate fire cage.  Each side, gap, and curve of the cage was perfectly consistent.</p><p>The centipede’s flames flickered, seeming strained.  A mistake was made, earning it another slap. The fire cage dispersed, giving the deer a new chance at life.</p><p>The centipede dared not resist, only continuing to pursue the deer, gradually improving its skill through repeated beatings, until finally satisfying the fire crow and ensnaring the deer.</p><p>The deer thrashed inside the cage.  The fire crow flew above the cage. The deer seemingly sensed something and suddenly stopped struggling, collapsing to the ground, trembling.</p><p>“This fire spirit is decent.  Take it back and let those two guys train it…”</p><p>The fire crow muttered to itself, lifting a claw and making a grabbing gesture.  The deer returned to its original form, transforming into a ball of fire. A crimson bead flew from the fire and was snatched by the fire crow.</p><p>The centipede flew over, eagerly eyeing the bead, but it dared not take it without permission.</p><p>“Good! Good! You’re still somewhat useful.  Here, consider this your reward!”</p><p>The fire crow scraped some of the bead’s surface, swallowing the rest. It belched.  The centipede received only a small crumb, unsatisfied.  It was always like this; the treasures were mostly consumed by the fire crow, and it dared neither to complain nor to rebel.</p><p>The fire crow then seemed to do some calculations with its fingers.  “Hmm, time to go back.  Those two annoying guys will start squawking again if we’re any later.”</p><p>With those words, the fire crow perched on the centipede's back, closing its eyes to nap.  The centipede, carrying the deer, obediently flew back.</p><p>After an unknown distance, they reached a vast lava lake.</p><p>Such a large lava lake is rare even here.</p><p>Just as the Golden Centipede flew to the shore, a clear voice suddenly came from above, "Off treasure-hunting again?"</p><p>A green light flashed in the void, revealing a person—Qin Sang.</p><p>The Golden Centipede and the Red-feathered Bird are actually the Fire Jade Centipede and the Vermillion Bird.</p><p>Seeing its master, the Golden Centipede was overjoyed, as if finally able to escape its suffering.</p><p>A figure suddenly leaped out of the lava river behind it—Gui Hou, quickly kneeling before Qin Sang.</p><p>"My lord, I failed to watch over them properly. Please punish me."</p><p>Qin Sang said, "You secretly protected them, what crime is there? Go."</p><p>"Yes!" Gui Hou grabbed a small deer and flew back to the training grounds.</p><p>At this time, the Red-feathered Bird's feathers trembled, and it slowly woke up.</p><p>"You're out of seclusion!"</p><p>In front of Qin Sang, the Vermillion Bird was just as casual, giving a hearty greeting, then fiercely slapped the Fire Jade Centipede, "This fool! I've taught it so much, and it still can't break through!"</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede flew to Qin Sang's side dejectedly, its head hanging low.</p><p>"Haven't you been unable to break through the Transcendence stage either? Come to my cave, I have something to ask you…"</p><p>With that, Qin Sang disappeared into thin air.</p><p>"Still trying to tattle! I'll deal with you later!"</p><p>The Vermillion Bird glared at the Fire Jade Centipede, kicked it into the lake, and flew into the Bright Fire Formation.  Many fire spirits were lined up before the mountain, and Luo Hou was conducting training.</p><p>With nothing better to do, the two demons selected some promising fire spirits to train as demon soldiers.</p><p>They were once feudal lords, each commanding countless demon soldiers, and were experts in this field. Now they are a formidable force.</p><p>Seeing the Vermillion Bird, Luo Hou bowed from afar.</p><p>Although they didn't know the Vermillion Bird's background, seeing its attitude towards their master, they could guess that it was no ordinary being. Every time the Vermillion Bird went out, Gui Hou would secretly guard it, fearing something might happen.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird held its head high, accepting the bow gracefully, without any thought of returning it, and flew towards the mountaintop.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, his gaze piercing through the stone door, watching the vast expanse of the world.</p><p>"Two hundred years…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly.</p><p>Two hundred years, plus the hundred years at Yan Shui Temple, he has been in the Great Thousand World for over three hundred years.</p><p>A mortal kingdom might not even last three hundred years.</p><p>But in this fire domain, time seems to have frozen.  This monotonous landscape wouldn't change even in a thousand or ten thousand years.</p><p>In these two hundred years, except for going to Yun Ding City to get the Yinghua Dan, Qin Sang had hardly left his home, immersed in cultivation. Yet, he knew everything that happened inside and outside his training grounds.</p><p>During these two hundred years, many cultivators passed by the lava lake, but no one ever suspected that a Void Refinement expert was cultivating here.</p><p>The two demons used the training grounds as a drill field.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird also awoke after a long slumber.</p><p>It 'grew' in its sleep, and upon awakening, it already had the peak cultivation of the Transformation stage, equivalent to a peak Nascent Soul stage human cultivator.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Vermillion Bird then stagnated, stuck before the Transcendence stage, just like the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Sculpting a spirit for the Vermillion Bird consumed two spirit feathers: a Vermillion Bird feather and a Celestial Phoenix feather.</p><p>Either feather, if fully refined by someone, would certainly grant more than just Transcendence stage power.</p><p>There's only one explanation: all that energy was used up in the spirit sculpting process.</p><p>With Qin Sang's current realm, he couldn't understand how difficult spirit sculpting was, especially since it was a Vermillion Bird.</p><p>Of course, it's also possible that the Vermillion Bird was up to something, doing it on purpose. That creature is very cunning and always thinks it's clever.</p><p>Qin Sang always felt that the Vermillion Bird's potential was far greater.</p><p>He asked the Vermillion Bird, but it wasn't worried at all.</p><p>It didn't continue to sleep and recuperate, nor did it go into seclusion or ask Qin Sang for help. It frequently went treasure-hunting with the Fire Jade Centipede, acting carefree. Qin Sang stopped paying attention to it.</p><p>As for the Fire Jade Centipede, entering the Great Thousand World and being in this environment for two hundred years also brought about considerable changes.</p><p>Despite being bullied badly, it received personal guidance from the Vermillion Bird, a rare opportunity.</p><p>Its inability to break through was also partly due to the Vermillion Bird deliberately suppressing it, which was actually beneficial.</p><p>As for Qin Sang's changes, they were even more significant.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed his own body.</p><p>Two hundred years is not a long time for a Transcendence cultivator.</p><p>Without that accident, it would have taken him decades to reach the peak of the Transcendence stage, then regulate the Five Elements, comprehend the unity of heaven and man through the way of the Five Elements, and gradually refine, searching for the opportunity to break through.</p><p>This time might be longer than the entire Transcendence stage cultivation, perhaps not achievable in two hundred years.</p><p>Taking that first step, then looking back and retracing the path, is much easier.</p><p>If he were just comprehending cultivation techniques, organizing his practice, and perfecting his path, it wouldn't have taken so long. But his foundation was damaged by the forced elevation of his realm, and repairing his foundation was a painstaking process.</p><p>Qin Sang had the ambition to become an immortal and the patience to do it, not allowing himself to leave any hidden dangers.</p><p>For two hundred years, Qin Sang had endured, not cultivating the twelfth layer of the "Meta-spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter."</p><p>Now, his foundation still needed some time to nurture, but Qin Sang was confident that he could do it without fail and started considering his next cultivation steps.</p><p>In a flash of thought, Qin Sang sensed the Vermillion Bird approaching and opened the stone door.</p><p>"Come in."</p>
