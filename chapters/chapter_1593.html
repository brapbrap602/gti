<h1></h1><p>Qin Sang listened to the cultivators discussing nearby.</p><p>This was the third area Su Zinan had searched.</p><p>The previous two had yielded nothing.</p><p>Cultivators gathered on several nearby islands, observing the outcome.</p><p>No one knew what method Su Zinan was employing.</p><p>The distant sea surface bulged high, seawater continuously pouring outward.  Qin Sang flew a little higher and saw that the bulge was ring-shaped, forming a bottomless pit in the center.</p><p>Inside the pit, lights of various colors flickered incessantly, and the fluctuations of magical treasures and Daoist techniques were clearly perceptible.</p><p>Several figures floated within the sea pit.</p><p>A few of them were clearly the core members.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze, discerning their appearances.</p><p>One of them, in white robes and a jade belt, handsome and unrestrained, was none other than the currently renowned Su Zinan.  His appearance was indeed a good match for Yue Fei.</p><p>“That old devil truly wasn't Su Zinan,” Qin Sang thought, recalling Wu Lao.</p><p>He remembered the old devil didn't have the Nether Moon Mark on his forehead and wasn't a Nether Moon Guard. He wondered what his position was within Luye.</p><p>Glancing over the others, Qin Sang noticed the man beside Su Zinan.</p><p>This person remained silent, standing there quietly, giving off an otherworldly air.</p><p>“Mo Xingdao, the foremost rogue cultivator of the Northern Wastelands. What is this person's connection to Luye... As expected of a Nascent Soul sect, they have at least three Grand Cultivators, openly or covertly! Did the old devil not come? Or is he hidden in the shadows, supporting Su Zinan?”</p><p>Qin Sang observed Mo Xingdao for a while, then awakened the Celestial Eye Butterfly, searching secretly.</p><p>From those around Su Zinan to the outermost onlookers,</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze over everyone, finding no one resembling Wu Lao.</p><p>The setting sun dipped into the sea.</p><p>As night fell, the treasure light in the sea pit suddenly extinguished. Su Zinan flew out of the pit with a grim expression, followed closely by Mo Xingdao and the others. The seawater receded, returning to normal.</p><p>Then, ignoring everyone else, Su Zinan flew directly back to the Chinan Island Chain.</p><p>As expected, the search had failed again.</p><p>…</p><p>For the next month,</p><p>Qin Sang followed Su Zinan to various locations, each time witnessing him depart with high hopes and return disappointed.</p><p>Su Zinan's movements were erratic, traversing east, west, north, and south.</p><p>After numerous instances, Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder if Su Zinan truly had a way to locate the Unrestrained Palace ruins or if he was deliberately delaying.</p><p>During these days, the number of Nascent Soul cultivators of unknown origin among the onlookers had noticeably increased. Some had obscure auras, deliberately concealed, but they couldn't escape Qin Sang's spiritual sense.</p><p>Being here didn't hinder his cultivation of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*. Qin Sang decided to continue observing Su Zinan.</p><p>Another half-month passed.</p><p>Qin Sang was cultivating when the innkeeper sent someone to report that Su Zinan had left the island again.</p><p>Su Zinan's every move was ostentatious, which saved Qin Sang from constant vigilance.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly ceased his cultivation, the Fire Lotus Seed disappearing into his forehead.</p><p>Without needing to ask where Su Zinan was going, Qin Sang stepped out of the inn and looked up, seeing streaks of escaping light flying across the sky, all heading in the same direction.</p><p>He unhurriedly followed.</p><p>He quickly realized that this time was different from before. Su Zinan flew southeast at his fastest speed upon leaving the island, his destination clear.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He increased his speed, surpassing most of the cultivators.</p><p>Soon,</p><p>Everyone followed Su Zinan to a new sea region.</p><p>Qin Sang habitually landed on a deserted island, finding a spot with a good view.</p><p>From afar, he saw Su Zinan and the others stopped above the sea, forming a circle, seemingly discussing something.</p><p>After a stick of incense,</p><p>Mo Xingdao and the other Nascent Soul cultivators each received a strangely shaped wooden stake from Su Zinan, then dispersed in all directions. Only one Nether Moon Guard remained by Su Zinan's side.</p><p>The wooden stakes were as thick as a thigh and only three feet long. Their surfaces were carved with dense grooves, reflecting an eerie blood-red light under the sunlight, like blood vessels with blood flowing continuously within.</p><p>Each person holding a wooden stake encircled an area of about ten miles in diameter, with Su Zinan at the center, floating above the sea, seated in mid-air.</p><p>Su Zinan closed his eyes tightly.</p><p>The others began to busy themselves.</p><p>From such a distance, Qin Sang couldn't tell what they were doing yet, but it seemed like they were setting up a formation.</p><p>A moment later, Su Zinan let out a low growl of unclear meaning.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and the others immediately threw their wooden stakes, which plunged straight into the sea.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Water splashed everywhere.</p><p>The wooden stakes pierced the sea surface, mostly submerged, with a portion exposed above the water, hovering motionless.</p><p>At the same time, Su Zinan raised his hands, swiftly completing a hand seal, then pressed his palms downwards. A streak of light shot into the sea.</p><p>The light silently merged with the seawater.</p><p>Suddenly, the outer wooden stakes underwent a transformation. The blood within the grooves flowed rapidly, emitting a dense bloody light. The stakes resonated with each other, the bloody lights attracting one another.</p><p>‘Swish, swish, swish…’</p><p>The bloody lights formed lines, connecting all the wooden stakes, creating a complex pattern on the sea surface.</p><p>Controlling this formation seemed to be a significant burden for Su Zinan. His face flushed, and his upper body swayed.</p><p>Just as the onlookers thought something had gone wrong with Su Zinan, he suddenly faded and disappeared.  Simultaneously, an image of Su Zinan appeared above each wooden stake, then flashed and merged into the stake.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>A loud shout accompanied the action.</p><p>The wooden stakes plunged into the seabed. The seawater at the center of the formation turned entirely into blood-red water, scarlet and dazzling, as if a blood-colored gem was embedded in the sea.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The blood-red water churned, transforming into a thick beam of blood-red light that shot skyward!</p><p>Both Su Zinan's actions and this Bloodwood Formation were drastically different from previous attempts.  Anyone could see that today would bring a change!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze followed the blood-red light and immediately witnessed a startling scene.</p><p>The blood-red light reached a height of three thousand feet, then abruptly vanished. The Bloodwood Formation was still active, the blood-red light continuing to surge upwards like a pillar, yet only the lower portion was visible.</p><p>It was as if an invisible giant mouth in the void was devouring the blood-red light!</p><p>Exclamations erupted from all around.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the point where the blood-red light disappeared, urging the Celestial Eye Butterfly to fully utilize its Celestial Eye ability.  Initially, he saw nothing; there was no imagined invisible barrier.</p><p>As the blood-red light intensified, a change finally occurred. A black dot faintly appeared within the blood-red light, then expanded at an alarming rate.</p><p>In an instant, the black dot grew to half the size of the blood-red light and continued to expand rapidly.</p><p>Even those without the Celestial Eye Butterfly noticed the change within the blood-red light.  An unknown force tore a large hole in the void, resembling some sort of passage.</p><p>“He truly found it!”</p><p>“Is it definitely the Unrestrained Palace? Was anyone present during the last opening of the ruins? Was it like this?”</p><p>“Elder Shen was present then! Eh? Where did Elder Shen go?”</p><p>…</p><p>Chaos erupted on the island.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the black hole with a solemn expression.  The black hole was pitch black, and for some reason, it gave him a sense of unease. As the black hole expanded, this feeling intensified.</p><p>Suddenly, a grey aura emerged from the black hole.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A deafening, earth-shattering sound resonated. Everyone gasped in astonishment, staring blankly upwards as the grey aura rushed out of the black hole, displaying an extremely violent power as it slammed downwards.</p><p>A grey waterfall was born in the void.</p><p>Even from such a distance, everyone could feel the world-shattering momentum, their hearts pounding in their chests.</p><p>The grey aura surged downwards.</p><p>Those within the Bloodwood Formation bore the brunt of the impact.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…’</p><p>Escaping lights fled the Bloodwood Formation.  Su Zinan and the others were disheveled, their faces filled with lingering fear as they looked back.</p><p>The grey aura was clearly a violently turbulent flow.</p><p>The Bloodwood Formation was torn to shreds. Now even the black hole was no longer visible.  An endless stream of grey aura gushed out, its interior chaotic, filled with a chaotic turbulence that spread outwards at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Qin Sang understood why it could flatten an entire island.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the scene of the Ziwei Palace's ascension.</p><p>There were also terrifying spatial turbulences within the spatial rifts. Even with the protection of the Ascension Platform, Nascent Soul后期 cultivation was required for self-preservation.</p><p>Of course, the two types of turbulence were different.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly sense chaotic restrictive forces within the grey aura, most likely caused by the destruction of a Spirit Formation or a Secret Realm.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators probably couldn't set up such a Spirit Formation. It was at least at the level of an ancient Immortal Formation.  The profoundness of the Unrestrained Palace was beyond imagination.</p><p>After a long time,</p><p>The Unrestrained Palace had become history. Some ancient texts had been unearthed recently, but the related records were scarce and not necessarily reliable.</p><p>According to research, the Unrestrained Palace at its peak was a super power spanning the continent and the East Sea, and it was likely jointly ruled by humans and demons.</p><p>The coexistence of the two races within one power was unimaginable to present-day cultivators.</p><p>Now, humans and demons were separated, and the Unrestrained Palace was in ruins.  Fortunately, the Middle Continent was vast enough, and the sea between the continent and the East Sea was expansive and desolate enough.</p><p>The rumbling continued, deafening.</p><p>In just a quarter of an hour, the turbulence covered a vast area of the sea, its expansion slowing down only then, transforming the area into a storm zone that blotted out the sky and covered the sun.</p><p>The surrounding sea regions were affected, with towering waves.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his protective True Essence, resisting the fierce winds, and shifted his gaze towards Su Zinan and the others at the edge of the turbulence.</p><p>Su Zinan's face was slightly pale.  Fortunately, he had escaped quickly and avoided the direct impact.  He circulated his True Essence, his voice overpowering the storm, “Which fellow Daoist is willing to assist me in entering the Unrestrained Palace? Su Mou’s previous offer still stands!”</p><p>Silence reigned in the distance.</p><p>A moment later, someone shouted back, “Fellow Daoist Su, are you planning to traverse this turbulence and enter the deepest part?”</p><p>Su Zinan's answer was unexpected, “Su Mou doesn’t know much about the Unrestrained Palace. Whether it's within the depths of the turbulence, we'll only know after entering.”</p><p>The crowd stirred upon hearing this.</p><p>With the precedents of the Eight Scenery Sect and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery,</p><p>Logically, both sects had returned in defeat.  Anyone with self-awareness wouldn't risk accompanying Su Zinan, lest they repeat their mistakes.</p><p>However, Su Zinan had been able to locate the Unrestrained Palace so quickly, and the Bloodwood Formation was clearly unusual.  He must know some unknown secrets.</p><p>Everyone was weighing the gains and losses; no one responded immediately.</p><p>Su Zinan shook his head, about to lead his group into the turbulence, when another person shouted, “Fellow Daoist Su, can you tell us why you want to enter the Unrestrained Palace? Since you claim to be giving up all treasures, you're not going there for treasure hunting, are you?”</p><p>Su Zinan remained silent for a moment before replying, “Searching for someone!”</p><p>Searching for someone!</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone was in an uproar.</p><p>There had long been rumors of Nascent Soul cultivators trapped within the Unrestrained Palace, first the Eight Scenery Sect and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, and now Su Zinan.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>Someone immediately asked.</p><p>Su Zinan glanced around, not finding the person who spoke. He coldly refused to answer and said in a deep voice, “Su Mou will wait for another ten breaths!”</p><p>Nine breaths passed in a flash.</p><p>Until the final breath, a streak of escaping light shone from a distant island. An old man with white hair and beard flew to Su Zinan and nodded, “This old man will accompany Fellow Daoist Su on this journey!”</p><p>Su Zinan was overjoyed.  He sized up the old man and said in surprise, “Are you perhaps Cave Master Qi Ling?”</p><p>The old man chuckled, “I’m honored that Fellow Daoist Su knows my humble name.”</p><p>“Cave Master is too modest.  Who in the Southern Continent doesn't know of Cave Master Qi Ling of the Wailing Spirit Cave? It's Su Mou's honor to finally meet Cave Master in person!”</p><p>Su Zinan was extremely enthusiastic.</p><p>Seeing that no one else responded besides Cave Master Qi Ling, Su Zinan didn't hesitate any longer and led his group into the turbulence.</p><p>As soon as they entered, streaks of escaping light flashed from the islands, flying towards the turbulence. After sensing the power of the turbulence, most cultivators flinched.</p><p>In such a place, even Golden Core cultivators wouldn't be able to go far.  Not only would they not obtain treasures, but they would also lose their lives.</p><p>However, the commotion Su Zinan created was too great. Many Nascent Soul cultivators were attracted, some alone, others in small groups.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the turbulence alone.</p><p>He didn't choose to go with Su Zinan.</p><p>Back then, to deal with Wu Lao, he had used the Sword Formation, Demonic Fire, and the Sun God Tree.  The other party knew about them.  If he encountered danger inside, he wouldn't be able to hide.</p><p>He would face the combined attack of three Grand Cultivators, which would be a loss he couldn't afford.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang had a vague feeling that Su Zinan's purpose wasn't simple.  If Old Devil Lu was trapped in the Unrestrained Palace, it contradicted Yue Fei's words.</p><p>It was still necessary to go in and see.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed into the turbulence.</p><p>It was relatively easy at the outermost layer.  He could avoid the impact of the turbulence by dodging.  But the turbulence changed very quickly.  Not far in, it became extremely dense, requiring him to endure it head-on.</p><p>Qin Sang urged the Ruyi Pearl, activating a protective罡罩.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly observed the surroundings for him.</p><p>He could see other cultivators on both sides.</p><p>Their direction was the same as Qin Sang’s, all intending to follow Su Zinan.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the others, letting the Celestial Eye Butterfly fully utilize its Celestial Eye ability, remotely locking onto Su Zinan's direction.</p><p>After traveling like this for a short distance,</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly stopped.</p><p>There was clearly nothing around, but at this moment, he inexplicably felt something different, as if he had entered a different space.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Several turbulent currents suddenly attacked simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He was immediately struck by several chaotic forces.  Rumbling sounds echoed as his protective罡罩 vibrated, flickering unsteadily.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly increased his True Essence, stabilizing the罡罩.</p><p>“Hiss… The power of the turbulence is this strong before even entering! Nascent Soul Initial Stage cultivators, without sufficiently strong protective techniques, can only stop here.”</p><p>Qin Sang prepared himself and continued forward, noticing that the cultivator on his left had indeed fallen behind.</p><p>Going further, it became increasingly difficult, and more and more people fell behind.</p><p>They could only stay nearby to search, hoping to find something.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression grew increasingly grave. He had inquired about the scene of the last ruins opening at the Chinan Island Chain. Although the power of the outermost turbulence was strong, it wasn’t to this extent.</p>
