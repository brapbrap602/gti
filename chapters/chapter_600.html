<h1>Chapter 593: The Sword Path</h1><p>After the sword energy dissipated, a faint shimmer receded into the cliff face, easily overlooked if one wasn't paying attention.</p><p>Before this shimmer appeared, the cliff seemed perfectly ordinary, with no trace of a ward or spirit array.</p><p>But when Qin Sang switched to his Cold Gold Sword and unleashed a normal burst of sword energy,</p><p>just as it was about to strike the cliff, it was blocked by a strange force. The sword energy shattered, rapidly dissipating until only a faint wisp remained, which landed softly on the stone without leaving a mark.</p><p>This time, however, no shimmer appeared on the cliff face.</p><p>As Granny Jing had said, only sword energy cultivated from the *Yuanshen Sword Raising Scripture*, imbued with the unique killing intent of the Killing Sigil, could activate the sword ward and open the way.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He immediately urged his Ebony Wood Sword to strike again.</p><p>As wave after wave of sword energy was absorbed by the cliff, the glow intensified.</p><p>Another burst of sword energy vanished into the cliff, and Qin Sang suddenly felt the mountain beneath his feet tremble slightly.  This time, the light on the cliff face did not disappear.</p><p>The entire cliff shimmered, the light coalescing into a doorway, its interior shrouded in darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened, and he flashed to the doorway.</p><p>The Ten Yama King Banner was now useless. Qin Sang focused on channeling the Ebony Wood Sword, circling it around himself as protection.</p><p>Beyond the door lay a magnificent ancient hall, dozens of feet high, its deepest recesses lost in shadow.</p><p>The hall was situated near the mountain's peak, where the slopes were steep.  Such a large structure shouldn't have been possible there.  Some unknown secret method must have been used in its construction.</p><p>Strangest of all, the hall's floor was covered in all manner of swords!</p><p>These weren't spirit swords but stone swords, carved from rock. Each was unique: some broad and heavy as mountains, others thin as cicada wings, but no two were alike.</p><p>They were planted hilt-deep in the ground, half their blades exposed, filling almost the entire hall.</p><p>Amidst the thousands of stone swords, a single path, wide enough for only one person, led straight to the depths of the hall.</p><p>This was a sword path!</p><p>Standing at the entrance, Qin Sang's expression was grave. These stone swords seemed ordinary, mere rock, but he could sense a chaotic sword intent filling the hall.</p><p>This sword intent was very familiar, originating from the same source as the *Yuanshen Sword Raising Scripture*.</p><p>The Killing Sigil on the Ebony Wood Sword trembled, as if rejoicing at encountering its kin.</p><p>Qin Sang stared into the heart of the hall.</p><p>It was shrouded in darkness, impenetrable to both sight and divine sense.  Any attempt to probe with his divine sense would result in it being instantly shredded by the pervasive sword intent.</p><p>What was this place?</p><p>A trial?</p><p>Qin Sang wondered. He knew that some sword cultivator sects had similar trials, where elders left behind the essence of their sword intent to guide their descendants in comprehending the sword path and refining their swordsmanship.</p><p>Mount Shaohua had such a place, called the Sword Tower. Qin Sang had been there twice, but the *Yuanshen Sword Raising Scripture* was too unique, making the benefits minimal, and Qin Sang had rarely returned.</p><p>The sword intent here was clearly different from the Sword Tower's. Each strand carried a startling killing intent, befitting its origins in the *Yuanshen Sword Raising Scripture*.</p><p>Those who cultivated the *Yuanshen Sword Raising Scripture* and dedicated themselves to the path of killing should gain insights from traversing this sword path.</p><p>But Qin Sang had only chosen this cultivation method for its rapid progress and powerful techniques. Relying on the Jade Buddha's protection during cultivation, he treated it as a tool, never fully immersing himself in the path of killing like others.</p><p>He wondered if he could glean anything from this sword path.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang channeled the Ebony Wood Sword, generating a protective aura of sword energy, and stepped into the hall.</p><p>The light instantly dimmed.</p><p>In that moment, thousands of stone swords vibrated, filling the hall with a long, resonant hum.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword also resonated, its sword energy fluctuating and buzzing.</p><p>In response to the Ebony Wood Sword, the scattered sword intent in the air calmed.</p><p>But the closest stone sword vibrated even more intensely. Suddenly, it flashed, and a streak of sword intent shot out, reaching him in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected these ordinary-looking stone swords to be able to unleash sword intent, and this sword intent was incredibly powerful, sending a shiver of apprehension down his spine.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was prepared. The Ebony Wood Sword flashed before him, intercepting the sword intent perfectly, its sword energy surging to meet the attack head-on.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>With the impact, the Ebony Wood Sword abruptly dimmed, its sword energy dispersed.</p><p>A sliver of the sword intent remained, bypassing the Ebony Wood Sword and slashing towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted.  He had struck with his full power, yet it was insufficient.  This sword intent was nearly as potent as a Golden Core cultivator's sword strike.</p><p>He quickly formed a sword seal, preparing to defend himself with his sword, but then paused, as if sensing something. He unexpectedly chose to forgo recalling the Ebony Wood Sword and defend himself solely with his own power.</p><p>The thread-like sword intent landed gently on Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>Qin Sang braced himself.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the sword intent didn't wound him physically.  Instead, it directly pierced his Nascent Soul space, where it was easily dispelled by the Jade Buddha's golden light.</p><p>"As I suspected!"</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly elated.  He had had an inkling of this.</p><p>This place was no different from Mount Shaohua's Sword Tower.</p><p>This seemingly terrifying sword strike was merely the true meaning of the sword path sealed within the stone sword, not true sword energy.  It only targeted the Nascent Soul, likely intended to deter disciples of insufficient cultivation.</p><p>If this was a trial, it would likely require a Golden Core disciple to pass with ease.</p><p>With his current cultivation, without the Jade Buddha's protection, he would have to cautiously and painstakingly break through each sword intent one by one. Even if he progressed smoothly, reaching the depths of the hall before the Violet Firmament Palace closed was uncertain.</p><p>He recalled Granny Jing mentioning that cultivators of the *Yuanshen Sword Raising Scripture* would have a greater chance of finding Senior Qingzhu's legacy after reaching the Golden Core realm.  It seemed she hadn't been exaggerating.</p><p>Fortunately, it was only a test of the Nascent Soul, easily countered by the Jade Buddha.</p><p>For him, this sword path was a smooth road!</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't rely solely on the Jade Buddha to force his way through.</p><p>In the instant the Ebony Wood Sword clashed with the sword intent, Qin Sang had glimpsed a fleeting, bloody scene. He hadn't had time to comprehend it before being startled by the sword intent's power.</p><p>Now, he realized that this scene was likely left by a past master, the sword intent containing their understanding of the cultivation method, the sword path, and the path of killing. If he could observe it more closely, he would surely gain insights.</p><p>Qin Sang's understanding of the cultivation method was far from the depth of Senior Qingzhu, who had dedicated their life to it, progressing step by step.  He might not immediately grasp anything profound.</p><p>But if he could memorize these fleeting glimpses and contemplate them later, it would surely benefit his future cultivation and comprehension of the Killing Sigil.</p><p>Perhaps it could even accelerate his inscription of Killing Sigils!</p><p>There was no danger, so why not?</p><p>He had entered the hall smoothly, without delay, and had ample time remaining.</p><p>Acting on the thought, Qin Sang channeled the Ebony Wood Sword and strode forward.</p>
