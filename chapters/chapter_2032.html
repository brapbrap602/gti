<h1>Chapter 2023: The Grave</h1><p>As Qin Sang moved forward, a powerful suction force tore at him, pulling him towards the void.  Approaching the edge of the black disc, he didn't stop but entered it.  Immediately, the suction intensified, accompanied by a rotational force. He activated his blood energy, relying on his robust physique to forcibly remain stationary. He felt as if he were trapped inside a giant millstone, relentlessly grinding him.</p><p>After experiencing this for a while, Qin Sang retreated, took some spirit materials from his storage ring, and quickly refined two puppets, which he threw into the black disc.</p><p>The puppets, once inside, were immediately caught in the suction, spinning rapidly along the disc's surface. Their speed increased exponentially, and they were sucked into the void almost instantly.</p><p>Due to their weak strength, the puppets offered no resistance to the suction. They weren't crushed by the disc but were swallowed by the void, their bodies remaining intact and virtually undamaged.</p><p>This observation didn't allow Qin Sang to determine the void's safety.  He saw the puppets vanish upon contact with the void, losing contact with them immediately. He had no way of knowing what befell them.</p><p>However, this test revealed some clues, leading him to ponder potential exploitable aspects and methods for exploring the void's interior.</p><p>Sending anyone or anything into the void meant accepting their probable demise.  One would also need to find a way to break the void's seal and transmit information back, otherwise, any attempt would be futile.</p><p>After much deliberation, Qin Sang realized that aside from risking his own approach and awakening his Sky-Eye Butterfly to attempt exploration using its divine ability, there seemed no other viable method.</p><p>Without immediately awakening the butterfly, Qin Sang decided to try other approaches. He manifested his Dharma body, repeatedly entering the black disc to gauge the suction's power, constantly pushing his limits, and employing various secret techniques to probe it.</p><p>While Qin Sang continued his efforts, a gentle breeze suddenly brushed his face.</p><p>The wind was exceptionally soft, like a warm spring breeze, easily ignored under normal circumstances. But here, it felt strangely out of place and ominous.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. He abruptly looked towards the depths of the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>Zhu Que and the other demon cultivators, belatedly realizing something was amiss, recalled the Fengju Jade Gate's legends and cried out, "It's the Evil Wind!"</p><p>The two natural disasters, the Evil Wind and the Ghostly Thunder, appeared for the first time since Qin Sang entered the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>These calamities sometimes appeared individually, sometimes together, without any discernible pattern.  As the cries echoed, the Evil Wind's force intensified dramatically.</p><p>Although the surroundings were tightly enveloped by divine ability illusions, the Evil Wind seemed to penetrate everything, constantly blowing, whistling in their ears.</p><p>It was said that the Evil Wind's power fluctuated, being relatively weak at times. However, their current location, amidst the divine ability illusions, was particularly precarious.  If the Evil Wind triggered the dormant power within these illusions, everyone would be terrified, especially with the terrifying black hole nearby.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. Without hesitation, he grabbed Zhu Que and the other demons, bringing them before him. Then, using his true body, he fled the area, leaving his Dharma body behind.</p><p>This was incredibly risky, but it offered a rare chance to observe the void using the Evil Wind.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>By the time Qin Sang escaped the area of divine ability illusions, the Evil Wind's power had reached a terrifying level.</p><p>Invisible wind gushed continuously from the depths of the Fengju Jade Gate, leaving visible streaks in the void, like bone-chilling blades cutting through emptiness.</p><p>Looking around, the Evil Wind was everywhere, unstoppable even by the divine ability illusions. Even Qin Sang's powerful physique felt an icy chill as the wind swept past.</p><p>Zhu Que, riding the Fire Jade Centipede, with flames rising from her body, fared relatively well. Gui Hou and Luo Hou huddled together, jointly resisting the Evil Wind.</p><p>'Clatter…Clatter…'</p><p>The captured cultivator, his cultivation sealed, shivered uncontrollably, his face pale, his body rapidly covered in frost.  Zhu Que intervened, protecting him until he recovered.</p><p>At this moment, cultivators elsewhere were also affected by the Evil Wind, causing chaos within the Fengju Jade Gate.  Some perished without even realizing what struck them.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the void through his Dharma body. As the Evil Wind intensified, the black disc became unstable, its surface rippling, occasionally emitting black jets.</p><p>Sensing the power of these jets, Qin Sang's Dharma body's expression grew grave. He retreated again and again. Finally, his expression changed completely, and he fled backward at lightning speed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang witnessed a shocking scene. A colossal, dark tide surged forward, overwhelming the closest divine power illusions near the black disc.</p><p>Qin Sang watched helplessly as these illusions, seemingly subjected to immense external pressure, were compressed and distorted.  Their fronts bulged before being stretched into thin, luminous bands, spiraling into the void until completely swallowed.</p><p>These illusions were manifestations of ancient power, almost indistinguishable from reality. Qin Sang had seen illusions destroyed before, but never anything consume them so completely and effortlessly.</p><p>With the eruption of the dark tide, the area became extremely dangerous.  Qin Sang's spirit body, unmoved, fixed its gaze on the void.</p><p>When the illusions vanished into the void, the expected conflict or explosion failed to materialize. The illusions simply disappeared silently. Given their inherent power, their annihilation should not have been so peaceful.</p><p>"Could the void truly lead to another place?"</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit body withdrew, flying to the edge of the illusion convergence zone. There, he discovered a luminous orb slowly drifting from the void – a solitary illusion.</p><p>"Was it drawn in by the void?"</p><p>Qin Sang gradually understood. The black disc's eruption caused the void to engulf surrounding illusions, while simultaneously drawing in others to replenish itself, hence its constant encirclement.</p><p>"What a gluttonous thing!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Fengju Yumen and Jushan Zhizhi Altar harbored many inexplicable phenomena.</p><p>After his spirit body merged with his main body, and after waiting some time, the evil winds subsided. Upon returning, Qin Sang found the black disc back to its original state.</p><p>Since even the divine power illusions hadn't revealed the void's nature, he decided against further investigation.  He memorized the location and left with Zhuque and the other spirit beasts.</p><p>The evil winds caused minimal damage. Qin Sang continued his travels as usual.</p><p>…</p><p>Unknowingly, seven years had passed since their entry into Fengju Yumen.</p><p>Tianyue Shangren had yet to appear.</p><p>Qin Sang diligently sought escape routes, identifying several locations and attempting to create escape paths. Combined with the mysterious void, he had three initial options. However, he felt this was insufficient. While enough to evade Nascent Soul cultivators, their effectiveness against the power of Unity and Ascension stage cultivators remained uncertain.</p><p>He never stopped. After Gu Ya's full recovery, she assisted Zhuque. Su Nu remained in seclusion, recovering from her injuries, while the Xin family remained without a target.</p><p>It's worth noting that his request for the Xin family to search for the Dihua Yu gui Teng had yielded a few ambiguous clues. However, Qin Sang wasn't focused on it and never investigated.</p><p>One day, it was time for their scheduled meeting.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived to meet the Xin family.  As expected, all parties remained unsuccessful. The Xin family's objective remained elusive.</p><p>As they discussed changing strategies, a streak of light sped towards them, apparently originating from outside Fengju Yumen.</p><p>The light landed before the Luanche, revealing a young, Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>"Xin Ming, why are you here? Did something major happen outside?" Lao Guanjia asked, stepping forward.</p><p>The Xin family hadn't brought all their personnel into Fengju Yumen, leaving some outside.</p><p>Xin Ming bowed hastily before the Luanche, using a sound-dampening spell, and urgently said, "Reporting to the young master and Lao Luo, Yumen Pass is in trouble!"</p><p>This statement startled Lao Guanjia. Xin Ming's spell couldn't hide this from Qin Sang and Pei Gongfeng, who immediately turned their attention.</p><p>Yumen Pass had stood for years. What could possibly happen? Could someone dare attack the city?</p><p>"A short while ago, powerful cultivators clashed near Yumen Pass, alarming the entire city. The collision of their powers shook heaven and earth, causing a blinding storm of sand and debris…"</p><p>Recalling the scene, Xin Ming's eyes widened in shock. He swallowed hard,  "Yumen Pass activated its protective formation, yet the city still shook violently under the impact, threatening to collapse. Then, with a thunderclap, a huge fissure appeared in the western wall, almost causing it to crumble…"</p><p>Qin Sang and Pei Gongfeng's expressions changed drastically at Xin Ming's description.</p><p>Yumen Pass, standing at the entrance of Fengju Yumen for years, was the western gate of Dezhou. The strength of its protective formation was undeniable.</p><p>Qin Sang, upon entering the city, witnessed only a fraction of the great formation's power, yet it was enough to dissuade him from any attempt at forceful entry.  The mere aftershocks of the battle, even through the formation, nearly destroyed the city walls. Were those who fought Body Integration or Mahayana cultivators? The sudden appearance of two powerful individuals near Fengju Jade Gate—what did it signify?</p><p>Was it coincidence, or was there an unknown event unfolding?</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, feeling uneasy. Could one of them be Tianyue Shangren, entangled with an enemy?</p><p>"Who were those fighting?"  Pei Gongfeng asked, voicing the question Qin Sang had in mind.</p><p>"Unclear," Xin Ming shook his head. "Throughout the entire event, the two powerful cultivators never revealed themselves. The citizens could only see raging storms and radiant lights in the sky.  Eventually, they left, and no one knows who won or lost."</p><p>Left… could they be heading towards Fengju Jade Gate?</p><p>Qin Sang and Pei Gongfeng exchanged a look.</p><p>"What's the situation at the Jade Gate now?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>"After that battle, rumors are rampant. People say a great war is coming. The city is in an uproar, fearing collateral damage. Many are leaving, fleeing to the heartland of Duizhou.  Similar panic happened when the Jiange fragments were first discovered, but this time, the impact from the powerful cultivators' fight is far greater, affecting nearly the entire city. Outsiders, independent cultivators, established sects, major trading houses—everyone is evacuating. It's utter chaos…"</p><p>Xin Ming's words deepened everyone's apprehension. They were inside Fengju Jade Gate, even closer to the center of the storm than the Jade Gate itself.</p><p>"Did the Five Elements Alliance leave too?" Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>"That…"</p><p>Xin Ming hesitated, aware that Qin Sang was an elder of the Five Elements Alliance, invited by the young master to assist.</p><p>"What's with the stammering? Speak plainly!"  Xin Shaozhu rebuked, speaking for the first time. His tone was remarkably even.</p><p>"Passing by the Five Elements Alliance, I saw they had closed their doors, but I don't know if they've evacuated everyone. The Jade Gate is nearly deserted.  Many sects that had been rooted there for years have sealed their gates and left to seek refuge. The city is in disarray," Xin Ming quickly replied.</p><p>Qin Sang thought, *It seems the Five Elements Alliance has withdrawn. They're merchants; avoiding danger is instinct.  With their size, they wouldn't risk it.*</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance was secondary. The crucial point was those two mysterious powerful cultivators—why did they come, and where are they now?</p><p>Even before Tianyue Shangren's arrival, turmoil arose.</p><p>Xin Ming's news was earth-shattering.  Luo Guanshi was worried. "Young Master, I fear Fengju Jade Gate is also unsafe. Should we leave and lay low...?"</p><p>Xin Shaozhu remained silent for a moment, then said, "There's no turning back now!"</p><p>Luo Guanshi sighed.</p><p>"Let's observe for a while longer," Xin Shaozhu said. "But we can't remain so dispersed. We'll consolidate into three groups…"</p><p>While the master and servant conferred, Pei Gongfeng's expression shifted, weighing something in his mind.</p><p>"This news is too shocking. I'll take my leave," Qin Sang bowed and prepared to depart.</p><p>Noticing Xin Shaozhu's gaze, Qin Sang added, "Young Master, rest assured.  Your family has helped me search for so long; there's merit in that effort. Unless absolutely necessary, I won't break my word."</p><p>"Thank you, Elder Qin."</p><p>Xin Shaozhu rose and bowed respectfully.</p><p>Pei Gongfeng's eyes narrowed slightly, watching Qin Sang's back without speaking.</p><p>After bidding farewell to the Xin family, Qin Sang considered his next move.  He decided to recall Zhuque and the others to his side, to prevent any unforeseen accidents.</p><p>And Su Nu—how were her injuries? This wasn't a place for recuperation.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly found Zhuque and the others.  Considering he didn't want Gu Ya and Su Nu to meet for now, he went alone to Su Nu's cave.</p><p>Su Nu looked healthier, though still faintly pale, her recovery incomplete.</p><p>"Thank you for the warning, Qin Xiong. It seems I should leave too, and reconsider my actions once I regain my strength.  Aren't you going to leave with me?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I still have unfinished business.  If things turn south, I'll find you immediately."</p><p>Su Nu didn't press further, simply saying, "Be careful, Qin Xiong!"</p><p>They agreed on a meeting place, and Qin Sang departed.</p><p>As Qin Sang's escaping light vanished in the distance, a man emerged from behind Su Nu.</p><p>The man's figure was ethereal, shrouded in an elusive aura, appearing profound and inscrutable.  Gazing at the direction of Qin Sang's departure, as if seeing his back across the void, he remained silent for a moment, then said, "From now on, you will stay by his side."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Su Nu bowed in obedience.</p>
