<h1>Chapter 1627: The Kirin Screen</h1><p>The layout of Bingyi Palace wasn't overly complex.  Besides two paths leading to side halls, the central path was almost straight, leading directly to the deepest part of the palace.  Along the way, there were some smaller branching paths, hinting at the presence of smaller buildings and halls. These were likely private chambers and other facilities for the palace disciples.</p><p>Having roughly understood the palace layout, the figure paused only rarely.  Until he emerged from the trees.</p><p>He saw a courtyard ahead, with a screen standing before it.  The screen's design featured only one type of mythical beast: Kirin, eight in total.  Each Kirin had a different expression, seemingly at play in the waters, their heads raised or lowered, standing still or leaping – a variety of poses depicting Kirin playing in water.</p><p>Years of neglect had dulled the colors and faded the design, making the screen look incredibly old.  Through the gaps in the screen, one could see parts of the courtyard: pavilions, waterside structures, and sculpted rockery – quite elegant.  It must have been a place for the palace cultivators to relax.</p><p>Similar to the small lake earlier, the area lacked strong magical barriers. The courtyard was overgrown, and even the Kirin screen was partially collapsed, suggesting that more Kirins were originally depicted.</p><p>However, looking beyond the screen, the figure saw a stunning, eerie blue light filling the courtyard's depths – clear evidence of powerful formations or barriers.</p><p>Undoubtedly good news. If the palace's formations were completely destroyed, the treasures within would have been plundered long ago.</p><p>The figure instinctively checked his surroundings, sensing nothing unusual.  Without pausing, he was about to dash into the courtyard when his expression changed drastically, his eyes turning stark white.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>A blinding white light burst forth, heading directly for the screen.  Without hesitation, he unleashed his *Ice Soul Radiance* technique.</p><p>Simultaneously, the screen blazed with cold light, instantly transforming into a transparent ice wall.  Then, beams of icy light shot out from the screen, rushing towards him.  Within these beams were Kirin, formed entirely of ice.</p><p>The screen now showed no trace of the original Kirin; these icy Kirin had come to life at some point, bursting from the screen, each aggressive and menacing.</p><p>Before the Kirin attacked, the figure had detected nothing unusual about the screen.  Unbeknownst to him, even the remaining half concealed a secret.</p><p>Fortunately, he was always vigilant, secretly gathering energy.  With the situation unclear, he had immediately unleashed the *Ice Soul Radiance*.</p><p>In an instant, the two beams of icy light clashed. The lead ice Kirin collided squarely with the *Ice Soul Radiance*.  Although the *Ice Soul Radiance* appeared weaker, upon contact, it suppressed the ice Kirin's cold energy. A cracking sound echoed as the Kirin was frozen solid in mid-air.</p><p>The figure knew, however, that freezing one Kirin wasn't enough. All the ice Kirin were connected to the screen, forming a single entity. Eight ice Kirin attacking together would be far more formidable than one alone.  Unless the screen was destroyed, or the screen's energy depleted, these Kirin would be virtually immortal.</p><p>While he could defend himself, he couldn't afford to be entangled with these creatures. As he considered a forceful breakout, he witnessed a peculiar sight.</p><p>Upon seeing the *Ice Soul Radiance*, the remaining seven ice Kirin showed less aggression, appearing hesitant, as if considering whether to rescue their companion. For a moment, they ceased their attack, circling warily.</p><p>The figure's expression shifted. The *Ice Soul Radiance*, forged using the mysterious ice disk, carried a unique, chilling aura!</p><p>The respite was short-lived.  Soon, the ice Kirin's aggression returned, and with a terrifying roar, they lunged forward.</p><p>The figure retreated, his sleeves billowing as the mysterious ice disk spun before him.  He removed a concealing spell, revealing the disk's aura in full.</p><p>The ice Kirin stopped abruptly, then showed signs of elation.  To his astonishment, they circled the disk like pilgrims, emitting cheerful cries, ignoring him entirely before returning to the screen, transforming back into the ordinary Kirin playing in the water depicted in the original painting.</p><p>The treasure is indeed deeply connected to Bingyi Palace!</p><p>Having easily overcome a crisis and discovered a new power of the mysterious ice disc, Hua Shen was in high spirits.  It seemed the faint chill of the Ice Soul Divine Light hadn't been recognized; only upon seeing the treasure itself did the ice qilin cease their attack.</p><p>Considering this, Hua Shen left the mysterious ice disc outside. After a brief pause before the silent screen, he gestured towards the jungle.</p><p>Several beams of white light flew out – identical ice bees.  These bees, formed entirely of transparent ice, melted silently into nothingness upon reaching Hua Shen's hand. This was a warning technique obtained from Xuantian Palace, left outside to alert him to anyone else entering the Ice Palace undetected. The Ice Palace and the surrounding area were dangerous, but caution was always best.</p><p>Since the screen was already in place, there was no need for further measures; doing so might only alert others.  The ice qilin had been repelled by the ice disc without a fight. By simply eliminating the ripples caused by the Ice Soul Divine Light, there would be no trace of his presence.</p><p>This also suggested he was the first to enter.  Others, lacking the mysterious ice disc, would likely leave traces when dealing with the ice qilin's attacks.</p><p>Having taken care of everything, Hua Shen bypassed the screen and entered the courtyard.  After some time, he reached the source of the azure light, the heart of Bingyi Palace, the main body of the Ice Palace's shadow.</p><p>A ruined palace, entirely of ice, met his gaze. Under the azure light, it seemed ethereal. Hua Shen stood at the foot of the ice steps, looking up.</p><p>Nine ice pillars stood before the palace, each supported by a different water-type divine beast statue. Only three remained intact; the others were broken. The palace gate was gone, revealing the interior.  Above was a damaged plaque, with only the characters 'Water Aspect' remaining.  The missing characters were likely 'Palace' or 'Hall'.</p><p>"It's indeed the Water Aspect lineage!"</p><p>Hua Shen nodded, his suspicion confirmed.</p><p>Remembering the screen, Hua Shen kept the mysterious ice disc hovering above him as he ascended the steps. He glanced at the palace; the azure light hung in the air, seemingly frozen, unchanging even as he approached.  He wondered if it was merely a reflection or if he hadn't yet entered its range.</p><p>Hua Shen hesitated slightly before entering the palace. His body floated, not touching anything.</p><p>The palace was riddled with holes, bearing the scars of a terrible battle. The extent of the devastation was readily apparent. The protective barriers were heavily damaged; exposed bones had crumbled to dust, but many fragments of magical artifacts remained, though powerless.</p><p>"This must have been the main battlefield of Bingyi Palace…"</p><p>Hua Shen imagined the past, proceeding silently.</p><p>The palace's interior was more expansive than it appeared from the outside, with interconnected halls, almost all ravaged by war.</p><p>Hua Shen's pace quickened as he traversed the halls.  Nearing what he guessed was the deepest part of the palace, a strange pressure stopped him in his tracks. He stood in a corridor between two halls, the azure light bathing everything in blue.</p><p>The pressure emanated from the azure light. He also noticed that the signs of battle continued beyond this point, though they became far sparser.</p><p>As Hua Shen moved, sensing changes in the azure light, he discovered that while he couldn't manipulate the palace's barriers with the mysterious ice disc, they wouldn't attack him unless he provoked them.</p><p>This emboldened him. He quickly crossed the corridor.</p><p>Before the next hall, he froze. An eye was watching him through a crack in the door!</p><p>He slowed, observing carefully. It was a statue.  Using his spiritual energy to form a hand, he pushed open the door, revealing the statue in its entirety.</p><p>The statue was almost as tall as the palace, seated with hands on its knees, its left hand forming a complex mudra, its right holding a whisk, radiating serenity.</p><p>"Not a deity!"</p><p>Judging from his experience, it was likely the ancestor statue of the Water Aspect lineage.</p><p>The offering table before the statue was overturned. The statue itself was severely damaged, a deep gash across its forehead having removed its right eye and half its face.  Its sole remaining eye had watched over this silent ruin for countless years.</p><p>Perhaps the Ice Palace was created by this ancestor.</p><p>At this sight, Qin Sang felt a deep resonance.</p><p>Hua Shen sighed, bowed before the ancestor's statue, and looked around.  He discovered a palace behind the statue, its door closed.</p><p>Hua Shen hurried over, reached out to push it open, but was repelled by a force. A blue light barrier flickered into existence on the door.</p><p>"The restriction is still active…"</p><p>Hua Shen stepped back, attempting to use the ice disc to open the door, but failed.</p><p>However, there was good news.  The backlash from the restriction dissipated upon contact with the ice disc.  Hua Shen could now break the restriction without fear of reprisal, further confirming his belief in the ice disc's crucial role for the Water Affinity lineage.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The ice soul radiance reappeared.</p><p>Instantly, the door seemed covered in frost.</p><p>The sound of cracking ice echoed as the ice layer thickened, freezing the light barrier.</p><p>Then, a blade of light burst from Hua Shen's palm, illuminating the palace. With lightning speed, it struck the center of the ice layer.</p><p>The light barrier shuddered, and visible waves rippled outwards.</p><p>The restriction's backlash was exceptionally fierce, triggering the entire palace.  An unnatural blue glow in the sky was also about to appear.</p><p>Seeing the ominous signs,</p><p>Hua Shen immediately used the ice disc to fly forward.</p><p>Upon contact with the ice disc, the backlash vanished, and the blue glow quickly subsided.</p><p>Hua Shen relaxed slightly, but saw the light barrier still resisting.  A thought struck him, he changed his hand seals, and a small seal rose slowly. To save time, he summoned a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Waves of icy flames erupted.</p><p>A small serpent, detached from the Four-Headed Serpent Seal, rapidly shrunk to arm-size. It danced, its small body tightly pressed against the Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade, and slammed into the barrier!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A blinding cold light flashed.</p><p>The sound of shattering echoed.</p><p>Hua Shen unleashed his abilities and treasures simultaneously, finally shattering the light barrier!</p><p>The backlash was again blocked by the ice disc, leaving Hua Shen unharmed.  Waiting for the waves to subside slightly, he dashed through the opening, using the Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade to pry open the door.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>As the door opened, Hua Shen saw a skeleton in the doorway.</p><p>Its empty eye sockets stared outwards before it tumbled to the floor.</p><p>Hua Shen's gaze sharpened. He immediately used the Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade to shield himself. The skeleton fell to the ground, instantly disintegrating into white dust.</p><p>Though brief, Hua Shen saw a wound across the skeleton's spine, almost severing it at the chest.</p><p>The skeleton had nothing else on it; a patch of white dust was its only remaining trace in the world, leaving its identity – a cultivator of the Water Affinity lineage or an enemy – unknown.</p><p>Hua Shen stepped over the ashes.</p><p>Beyond the door lay another palace, no smaller than the first. Ice walls separated different chambers, with a small portion of one door open.</p><p>Hua Shen entered, examining the ice walls.</p><p>The ice walls prevented observation; he couldn't see beyond them.  He quickened his pace to the first door, pushed it open, and was surprised.</p><p>Racks made of profound ice filled the chamber, divided into differently sized compartments.  It reminded Qin Sang of the Xuan Tian Palace's treasury.</p><p>As expected, this was the Water Affinity lineage's treasury!</p><p>Most compartments were empty, but many treasures remained, mostly precious minerals and materials rarely found outside, each of significant value.</p><p>“Brilliant God Stone, Human-Faced Ghost Jade, Purple Soft Gold…”</p><p>While lacking truly unique treasures, the sheer quantity was substantial wealth.</p><p>However, unknown to him, most of the treasury's contents had been taken during the great upheaval, used to create weapons, artifacts, and arrays for defense. Otherwise, Qin Sang's harvest today would rival that of a major sect.</p><p>Hua Shen ruthlessly emptied the treasury, continuing his search in the other chambers, but his expression gradually turned disappointed.</p><p>Chambers storing medicinal herbs, pills, and treasures remained, but their contents were scarce.</p><p>The best-preserved chamber was the scripture hall, where Hua Shen made significant gains.  A quick scan revealed various scriptures on Water Affinity techniques, covering Daoist, Buddhist, and demonic paths, demonstrating an extensive collection.</p><p>Hua Shen found several useful techniques.</p><p>However, from Qin Sang's perspective, this was insufficient to support the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect lineage, indicating the true heritage had been taken!</p><p>The origin of the ice disc and two pills remained a mystery, leaving him unsatisfied.</p><p>Furthermore, he hadn't found the eye of the Ice Palace Grand Array, suggesting hidden secrets!</p><p>Searching further, Hua Shen found a hidden passage at the end of the treasury, descending straight down.  He hadn't gone far when he discovered several skeletons lying within.</p><p>Hua Shen paused, examining them and noticing one different from the rest.</p><p>This skeleton had more wounds than the others, but Hua Shen judged it to be the one who survived the longest.</p><p>The skeleton sat cross-legged in the corner, its back against the wall, head tilted upwards.  Its empty eye sockets revealed nothing of its feelings, yet a sense of desolation washed over Hua Shen.</p><p>Around it lay scattered objects and jade bottles, likely once containing pills.</p><p>A healing array was beneath it.</p><p>However, none of this saved its life.</p><p>The skeleton's cultivation level in life was unknown, ending in lonely death.</p><p>Before it lay several items: jade slips, treasures, and strange tokens, along with an eight-character epitaph – "The disciple is incompetent, failing the ancestors!"</p>
