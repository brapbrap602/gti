<h1>Chapter 2156: Battle Once More</h1><p>“Well, unforeseen circumstances are inevitable…”</p><p>Shaoshi trailed off, letting out a dry laugh as he glanced at the fleeing Jiqiong and his companion. “Compared to them, we can consider ourselves lucky. Those two are the real unlucky ones. They must have stumbled onto that great fiend’s path, hence their panic.”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed towards the source of the oppressive aura, then back at Jiqiong and his companion, noticing some unusual signs.  “They don’t seem to be the target of that great fiend…”</p><p>As they spoke, the two concealed themselves completely, carefully retreating.</p><p>They weren’t entirely sure of the strength of a Unity Stage fiend, but they were certain that if they were targeted by this great fiend, their chances of survival would be slim!</p><p>They dared not make any conspicuous movements, fearing they might attract the great fiend’s attention.</p><p>“They aren't even qualified to be hunted by a great fiend!”</p><p>Shaoshi declared decisively. “A casual strike from a great fiend would force even us to retreat, let alone them!”</p><p>Qin Sang silently nodded. Shaoshi’s words rang true. If it were Jiqiong and his companion who had provoked the great fiend, they wouldn’t even have the chance to escape.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang mused, “Currently, within the Sacred Ground, there aren't many combinations that could confidently defeat us, even a group of three or five wouldn’t dare provoke a great fiend.  It hasn't been long, and the elites of our respective clans haven't had time to gather. Organizing multiple experts to hunt a great fiend together is also impractical. In that case, who provoked that great fiend?”</p><p>Hearing this, Shaoshi’s expression shifted slightly. “Unless someone was unfortunate enough to stumble upon the great fiend’s lair, or was foolish enough to barge in themselves, this great fiend might not have been provoked at all! The first two scenarios are practically impossible. Could there be some unknown event that forced the great fiend to leave its lair?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t express agreement or disagreement.</p><p>Their speed didn’t diminish in the slightest, retreating further and further, both closely monitoring the great fiend’s movements.</p><p>At this very moment, in the distant east, a mass of gray fog was rapidly spreading across the land.  Wherever the gray fog passed, it brought an aura of death. Flowers, grass, and trees withered, gray fuzz growing on them, devouring their life force, corroding them into puddles of mud in the blink of an eye. Whether mundane plants or spiritual flowers and trees, none were spared.</p><p>The fiends inhabiting the gray fog’s path met with disaster. Some were still slumbering in their lairs, completely unaware of the approaching death, losing their lives in their confusion.</p><p>Their bodies were covered in gray fuzz, rapidly decaying into stark white bones, transforming the area into a domain of death.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A furious roar echoed from within the gray fog. On the surface of a large lake floated numerous decaying white bones, their massive frames suggesting they were incredibly large and powerful creatures in life.</p><p>Among the piles of bones, a fiend, only half the size of the skeletons but with the same skeletal structure, was still alive. It was the only living being in this area, and the aura it emanated was comparable to a Void Refinement cultivator, perhaps the reason for its survival.</p><p>But this fiend trembled all over, its eyes filled with terror and pain. Fear had unexpectedly overcome its ferocious instincts. It leaped onto the shore and ran frantically, but the power of the gray fog continued to erode it. Fuzz sprouted on parts of its body, suppressed by its instinctive power, only to reappear elsewhere, causing it to stumble and stagger, a truly grotesque sight.</p><p>Just then, a massive shadow appeared above the gray fog, obscuring the sky.</p><p>Suddenly, something descended from the shadow. Upon closer inspection, it was a gigantic bird claw.</p><p>The claw had three talons, its skin rough like vines, resembling a celestial pillar descending from the heavens.  It landed precisely in the path of the fleeing fiend.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Several mountain peaks were crushed by the bird claw, instantly shattering.  Three long trenches appeared on the ground, leaving a deep claw mark. The claw lifted, leaving the ground deathly silent. The fiend, without a sound, hadn't even put up a proper resistance before being trampled to death.</p><p>This stomp seemed to be a mere coincidence. The owner of the claw never revealed itself, nor did it pause for a moment.  The shadow within the gray fog swiftly moved away.</p><p>…</p><p>In the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi repeatedly confirmed that the great fiend wasn’t heading towards them before daring to relax slightly.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin, what do you think happened in the great fiend’s lair?” Shaoshi pondered.</p><p>“It’s unlikely that another fiend attacked it,” Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Shaoshi said, “These great fiends all have their own territories and generally don't intrude upon each other’s domains. But something that could scare off a great fiend is definitely unusual, perhaps concealing some opportunity.”</p><p>Pausing, Shaoshi looked in the direction Jiqiong and his companion had fled. “There must be signs of the changes in the great fiend’s lair. They might have seen something.”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Si wants to capture them?”</p><p>Qin Sang also looked up. To avoid the great fiend, they hadn’t dared to act rashly, retreating a considerable distance. Jiqiong and his companion had already vanished from sight.</p><p>However, knowing the direction of Jiqiong’s escape, finding them again wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>“Isn’t that person an old enemy of Fellow Daoist Qin?  You wouldn’t stop me, would you?”</p><p>Shaoshi glanced at Qin Sang. “Fellow Daoist Qin may spare them, but they won't show any gratitude. The Sacred Ground’s contention ultimately boils down to the struggle between the Celestial Department and the Aquatic Department. Fellow Daoist Qin entered with the help of our Siyou Clan's Mirage Conch, meaning you bear the mark of the Celestial Department.  If Aquatic Department experts encounter you, unless there's a greater benefit that compels them to form a temporary alliance, they won't show you any mercy.”</p><p>Qin Sang already knew these principles without Shaoshi explaining them. The so-called Sacred Ground trial ultimately couldn’t escape the struggle between the Celestial and Aquatic Department factions.</p><p>But Qin Sang had only a rudimentary understanding, enough to avoid inadvertently breaking any taboos. He didn’t intend to participate.</p><p>These matters had little to do with him, an outsider. No matter how precious the treasures, they might not be suitable for outsider cultivators. Even if he could snatch them, it would be difficult to take them out under everyone’s watchful eyes.</p><p>His disguised identity, maintained by the power of spirit pills, would be exposed as soon as he engaged in combat.</p><p>Qin Sang’s purpose in entering the Sacred Ground was clear: to reunite with Liu Li as soon as possible. If everything went smoothly, he could observe from the sidelines, waiting for a suitable opportunity to appear before making his move.</p><p>He worried that attacking Jiqiong now would attract the great fiend, or perhaps even a more terrifying existence lurking behind it.</p><p>Shaoshi, aware of Qin Sang’s concerns, said, “We could follow them discreetly and strike when we reach a safe area. There won't be many cultivators in the same region, so we don’t have to worry about others getting there first.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. The two immediately changed direction, quietly pursuing their targets.</p><p>…</p><p>Within a mountain valley,</p><p>Jiqiong and another Quanfeng Clan expert were still shaken.  Jiqiong stared intently outside the valley, while his companion focused on sensing their surroundings.</p><p>“How is it?” Jiqiong couldn’t help but ask. His cultivation was slightly inferior, his spiritual sense not as acute as his companion’s.</p><p>“That oppressive aura has moved far away,” his companion opened his eyes and said softly.</p><p>Jiqiong was relieved, then couldn’t help but complain, “Fortunately, it wasn't after us! How could we be so unlucky, encountering a suspected Saint Realm great fiend right after entering the Sacred Ground!”</p><p>His companion sighed, “I don’t know why that great fiend left its lair. We just suffered an unexpected calamity! We left too many traces while escaping. I wonder if that great fiend will return. This place isn’t safe. We should leave quickly.”</p><p>“Alright!” Jiqiong nodded repeatedly. “The sooner we reunite with Elder Quan, the better!”</p><p>His companion glanced at him and said, “Aren’t you going to retrieve the Elephant Soul Sand? Refining the Elephant Soul Sand should allow you to break through to the Mid-stage. It would be safer for us to travel within the Sacred Ground.”</p><p>“Let's confirm our location first. If it's on the way, I'll try to retrieve the Elephant Soul Sand. Otherwise, I'll reunite with Elder Quan and ask for his assistance,” Jiqiong said. This encounter with the great fiend had taught him a lesson. He only felt safe beside Elder Quan.</p><p>“Elder Quan truly values you!”</p><p>A flicker of envy flashed in his companion’s eyes.  His figure flickered, escaping from the valley.</p><p>Jiqiong also circulated his movement technique to follow.  Unexpectedly, just as he flew out of the valley, the surroundings suddenly darkened. The Sacred Ground, like the outside world, had distinct days and nights. It was currently daytime, yet it had suddenly turned into night.</p><p>The earth and mountains vanished into thin air, and he was pulled into a boundless starry sky, surrounded by brilliant starlight and countless floating stars.</p><p>The familiar scene stunned Jiqiong, evoking unpleasant memories, then he felt a sense of bewilderment.</p><p>“How is this possible! That person is either human or demon, how could he appear here?  Could it be…”</p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through his mind in an instant.</p><p>However, Jiqiong’s reaction wasn't affected. The moment he fell into the sword formation, he threw out a black seed.  It was almost a replay of the past.  Jiqiong had nearly lost his life trying to break the sword formation with this treasure.</p><p>The vines took root, sprouted, and extended their branches. Previously resembling spiritual snakes, now they were like giant pythons, their power far surpassing before. This time, he didn’t let the vines occupy the sword formation, instead, he surrounded himself with them, layer upon layer, forming a solid barrier, prioritizing self-preservation.</p><p>However, Jiqiong quickly realized something was amiss.</p><p>The last time, the sword formation only had stars in the west and south. Now, the east was also brilliantly lit, only the north remained a chaotic nebula.</p><p>This meant his enemy’s strength had also increased!</p><p>What shocked Jiqiong even more was that, despite circulating his Divine Ear technique with all his might, his ears trembling incessantly, he couldn't sense his companion’s presence.</p><p>Before entering the Sacred Ground, he and his companion had jointly refined a treasure, controlled by his companion. Even if he were trapped, his companion could contact him through this treasure, and they could activate it together to break through the enemy’s formation.</p><p>Now his companion showed no reaction. Could it be that he didn’t even have the chance to activate the treasure, or had his companion also been trapped and killed?</p><p>His opponent was definitely also traveling with a companion, most likely a Siyou Clan expert. If his companion wasn't a match for that person…</p><p>The more Jiqiong thought about it, the more terrified he became. Recalling the past events, if he had already broken through to the Mid-stage, he might have had a fighting chance. Now, he had no confidence in defeating Qin Sang.</p><p>Those who cultivated to this level were rarely indecisive, especially since Jiqiong had suffered a significant loss at Qin Sang’s hands.</p><p>A sense of foreboding arose in his heart. Jiqiong didn't hesitate. Before the true power of the sword formation could be unleashed, his entire body surged with blood. His skin turned blood red, blood seeping from his pores, his body transforming into a blood gourd.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>With a loud explosion, Jiqiong’s physical body detonated, blood and flesh splattering everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang had destroyed one of his bodies before, but that was passive. This time, it was a self-detonation.  At his level of cultivation, losing his physical body would require a considerable price to recover.  Last time, thanks to Elder Quan’s reward, he had turned misfortune into fortune. This self-detonation was likely to affect his breakthrough plans.</p><p>But priorities mattered. As long as he could escape now and obtain the Elephant Soul Sand, he would eventually break through.</p><p>Therefore, Jiqiong decisively self-detonated his physical body. The blood and gore contained astonishing power, exploding like a blood cloud within the starry sky, dyeing the starlight crimson, the vines transforming into countless blood pythons, snapping and clawing at the stars.</p><p>At the same time the blood cloud surged into the sword formation, white light flashed where Jiqiong had been, revealing a naked miniature figure.</p><p>Jiqiong directly manifested his Nascent Soul in place, making no attempt to escape the sword formation. Instead, he remained motionless, opened his mouth, and looked up at the sky, letting out a long howl.</p><p>The howl was shrill, containing a peculiar power, causing invisible ripples in the void, spreading rapidly. At this moment, the starry sky had just been impacted by the blood cloud.  The howl, borrowing this momentum, was about to break through the sword formation’s blockade.</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed all of Jiqiong’s actions, understanding his intentions.  He couldn't help but inwardly admire this person’s ruthlessness and decisiveness.  Upon realizing the unfavorable situation, he had decisively self-detonated his physical body and attempted to attract the great fiend with his howl.</p><p>If Jiqiong succeeded, he and Shaoshi would have to abandon this operation, giving Jiqiong a sliver of hope.</p><p>If they couldn’t all escape, dying together with the enemy wasn't a loss.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jiqiong didn't understand what kind of enemy they were facing.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Jiqiong coldly, making no move. Just as the howl was about to break through the blockade and resound throughout the heavens, a cold snort echoed.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>A furry hand, resembling a bear paw and as large as a mountain, appeared in the sky and slammed down. With a single palm, it shattered the ripples caused by the howl, then, under Jiqiong’s horrified gaze, reached towards him.</p><p>Jiqiong’s fate was sealed.</p><p>Qin Sang looked away, towards the outside of the formation.</p><p>He and Shaoshi, aiming for a swift victory, had divided the tasks beforehand, ultimately choosing Jiqiong and intending to capture him alive, hence this elaborate process.</p><p>Shaoshi had brought the Eight Extremes Boundless Diagram into the Sacred Ground this time.  The other person was currently trapped within the diagram. Although its power had been damaged during the battle with the Reed King, it remained a rare treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang no longer paid attention to the battle here, withdrawing his sword formation and flashing into the treasure diagram.</p><p>Not long after, the two quietly left the valley, not looking back as they escaped into the distance, stopping only when they could barely sense the great fiend’s oppressive aura.</p><p>Shaoshi successfully captured Jiqiong and brought him aside for interrogation.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for a moment, then heard Shaoshi say, “Our guess was correct.  Something must have happened in the great fiend’s lair. This person saw a myriad of radiant light erupt from the direction the great fiend came from. It definitely wasn't another great fiend chasing it.”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Si intends to investigate?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked in a low voice.</p><p>He had inscribed his name in the Grand Void Golden Book and had to assist the Si Emperor with all his might, avoiding any unnecessary complications. But Shaoshi was the Si Emperor's confidant. If even he wasn’t in a hurry, he wasn't worried about delaying the main objective.</p><p>“Aren't you curious, Fellow Daoist Qin, about what could scare off a great fiend? Based on past experience, it could be a suddenly manifested secret realm or a future exit from the Sacred Ground. Either way, it's not to be missed.  If we don’t even dare to take a look, what are we here for?” Shaoshi countered.</p>
