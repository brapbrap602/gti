<h1></h1><p>There were many Nascent Souls in the city, making it impossible to ascertain how many Nascent Souls from the Profound Heaven Palace had disguised their identities and infiltrated. It was thought that keeping a close watch on these three Elders would suffice.</p><p>Yet the opponents had vanished into thin air right under their noses!</p><p>"Master, please forgive us!"</p><p>Upon seeing this scene, the two disciples were greatly alarmed.</p><p>The Old Devil Hunmo didn't even glance at them. He reached out and grabbed a fragment of the ice sculpture, his figure transforming into a streak of black rainbow as he flew into the air, surveying his surroundings before quietly escaping.</p><p>"Junior Brother, you gather the men and search for the Profound Heaven Palace's Law Enforcement Hall disciples. I'll go assist Master."</p><p>One of the black-robed men said in a low voice, immediately urging his flying magical treasure to pursue him.</p><p>The other one then vanished into the shadows.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside of Hunmo Island.</p><p>Profound Heaven Palace's Elder Mei and Elder Lan were hidden beneath the surface of the sea, encased in an ice sphere formed of thin ice.</p><p>At this moment, they had already put some distance between themselves and Hunmo Island.</p><p>This was not only due to their concern that the Old Devil Hunmo might interfere, but also because they were wary of the forces behind the Myriad Devil Assembly.</p><p>If they were to act near Hunmo Island, violating the rules and angering those people, the Profound Heaven Palace, even if unafraid of retaliation, would have to consider the subsequent repercussions, unless their disciples would no longer enter the Boundless Sea in the future.</p><p>Throughout the years, countless facts had proven that they would indeed exact a crazed revenge on those who crossed the line.</p><p>Within the thin ice sphere.</p><p>The two Elders were sitting and standing respectively.</p><p>Elder Mei gazed intently in the direction of Hunmo Island.</p><p>Finally finding the whereabouts of the Sacred Object, its return was imminent, yet for some reason, she felt a lingering unease in her heart.</p><p>Elder Mei recalled the various arrangements they had made. There should be no oversights.</p><p>The three ice sculptures created the illusion that they were still in the city.</p><p>The Old Devil Hunmo's attention was mostly drawn by the sudden appearance of the Great Sage Golden Peng, so this arrangement would suffice. Doing more would be superfluous, and might even backfire .</p><p>They didn't expect to deceive the Old Devil Hunmo for long; their only goal was to buy time to retrieve the Sacred Object and prevent the Old Devil Hunmo from interfering.</p><p>Once successful, all the Profound Heaven Palace disciples would converge, and even the Old Devil Hunmo could only watch them leave.</p><p>There was even less to worry about with the arrangements here.</p><p>To avoid alarming the enemy, everyone was lying in ambush outside Hunmo Island.</p><p>At this time, all the Profound Heaven Palace's Nascent Soul stage Elders were scattered in every direction except the north, forming an inescapable net .</p><p>The north was the inevitable path of the Great Sage Golden Peng and the various Demon Kings' return journey. They didn't want to expose their identities, attract powerful enemies, and cause accidents, so they only allowed an Elder skilled in concealing his aura to lie in wait there.</p><p>If the person carrying the Sacred Object were to leave from the north, they would wait for the Great Sage Golden Peng to depart far away before acting.</p><p>If it were from any other direction, things would be much simpler.</p><p>To guard against the opponent making detours, the Elders responsible for the ambush couldn't act rashly.</p><p>The two of them would rely on the ice key's  sensing ability, quickly approaching the opponent. If they couldn't catch up in time, the Elder lying in wait there would reveal himself first, entangling the opponent.</p><p>They would arrive in moments, leaving no room for error.</p><p>In the event that the three of them combined were no match for the opponent, the Elders lying in ambush in other directions would have already successively arrived at the battlefield, leaving the opponent with no way to escape!</p><p>However, Elder Mei felt that this possibility was unlikely.</p><p>Even if that evil spawn's opportunities defied the heavens, breaking through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, Elder Mei was confident in taking him down, unless the opponent was in the late-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>As her thoughts raced, Elder Mei caught sight of the light on the ice key beginning to move, and her heart stirred. "The trade fair has ended?"</p><p>The octagonal, profound ice-shaped ice key floated in front of Elder Lan's chest, flashing incessantly.</p><p>Elder Lan 'hmmed' in response, lightly grasping the ice key, his eyes slightly closed. "That person is making detours."</p><p>This was within their expectations.</p><p>The two Elders patiently remained still, staring intently at the ice key. After a dazzling series of changes, the ice key's transmitted sense pointed directly south!</p><p>"South!"</p><p>Elder Lan suddenly stood up.</p><p>The two of them had made the wrong bet, guarding the direction opposite the Profound Heaven Palace, on the west side of Hunmo Island.</p><p>Elder Mei acted even faster, her fingers rapidly tapping in the void. The sound of cracking and bursting rang out as the thin ice that formed the ice sphere shattered into countless ice fragments, scattering across the sky.</p><p>In an instant, these ice fragments gathered around them, transforming into a cloud of frigid air, enveloping the two of them and breaking through the air.</p><p>Having just flown out not far.</p><p>Elder Lan suddenly exclaimed in alarm, "Not good! That person's escape speed is so fast!"</p><p>The ice-escape technique they cultivated was one of the Profound Heaven Palace's most supreme techniques, rarely matched in the cultivation world, yet the opponent was even faster than them!</p><p>Elder Mei's face darkened. "The one guarding the south is Shi Xue! Have her entangle the opponent! She's already at the peak of the early stage, and has been trapped by the bottleneck for many years. Even when facing a mid-Nascent Soul stage cultivator, she has the power to contend."</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>…</p><p>Outside of Myriad Devil City.</p><p>Qin Sang smoothly left the city and immediately sensed that there were several auras of Nascent Soul cultivators near Hunmo Island, undisguised and with imposing momentum.</p><p>Like guardians, they were stationed in all directions .</p><p>"These are the Nascent Souls invited by the forces behind the Myriad Devil Assembly?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused to himself.</p><p>With these experts, plus the Old Devil Hunmo, indeed, few dared to cause trouble in Hunmo Island.</p><p>However, they could only guarantee the stability of the area near Hunmo Island. If a conflict were to occur outside this area, they would only watch with indifference.</p><p>Qin Sang still harbored some vigilance towards these Nascent Souls, as perhaps one of them was in cahoots with the Old Devil Hunmo.</p><p>He restrained his aura, found a gap to leave the island, and deliberately made several detours.</p><p>Urging his divine sense and using the Heavenly Eye Divine Power in conjunction, he confirmed that there were no trackers. Once he was out of sight of these people, he no longer hesitated, his body transforming into lightning as he sped away.</p><p>"The *Seven Teacher Buddha Seal* and the materials to enhance the Jin Chen Sword's Spirit have both been acquired. It's a pity that the spiritual objects needed for the Spirit Ascension Ritual weren't gathered. It seems that the Yuan Yin Water and Yin Nether Soil cannot be obtained outside of Hundred Flower Valley. No wonder Valley Master Mu can remain so calm, without trying to contact me. I wonder how many Myriad Spirit Fruits it will take…"</p><p>While being vigilant of his surroundings, Qin Sang pondered the gains and losses of this trade fair.</p><p>"This time was considered smooth. The Old Devil Hunmo didn't play any tricks. I wonder if it's because he didn't want to or couldn't. The major forces behind the Myriad Devil Assembly are not kind individuals and can restrain the Old Devil Hunmo. It seems that the dual preparations I made were not needed, a waste of a set of array tools and three pill formulas."</p><p>After flying out for a short while, Qin Sang's gaze narrowed slightly.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly also sent a warning.</p><p>Thanks to his powerful divine sense, he sensed the abnormality ahead before the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Of course, this was also due to the opponent's concealment methods not being particularly skillful. Otherwise, at such a distance, it would be difficult for divine sense to detect, and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's role would be irreplaceable.</p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p>Qin Sang cursed himself for his bad luck, while also feeling a sense of doubt in his heart.</p><p>He hadn't sensed any marks being planted on him. Why could this person accurately grasp the direction in which he was leaving?</p><p>"Could it be…"</p><p>Qin Sang had a flash of inspiration, thinking of the mysterious ice box inside the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>However, he wasn't planning on wasting words.</p><p>Regardless of the opponent's background, or whether they were here for him, lurking stealthily in the dark was certainly not out of goodwill.</p><p>Without a word, Qin Sang feigned ignorance, silently chanting the *Thunder Control Art*, and raised his hand to unleash a bolt of Heavenly Lightning!</p>
