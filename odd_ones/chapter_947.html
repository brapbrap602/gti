  <p class="calibre5">
   A series of notifications popped up on the interface.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   A huge cyclone was formed with Han Xiao at the center, and from outer
          space, it looked like a pot of gray soup being stirred rapidly.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   [Divine Throne Mechanic] was a new boundary, and the level limit was
          increased from forty to sixty! Han Xiao had gone from Apostle,
          Emperor, Lord, and finally arrived at Divine Throne!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This was the current peak of the Mechanics in the universe. ‘Mechanic
          Emperor’ Manison was currently at this stage, and there was not a
          Mechanic who had exceeded him yet.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   At his current stage, all his abilities went through a series of
          transformations.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   If the strength of an Apostle Mechanic was mainly reliant on himself,
          the specialty of an Emperor Mechanic was strengthening the Army Style,
          and the specialty of a Lord Mechanic was increasing the long distance
          combat ability of a Mechanic and creating Apostle Weapons, the
          specialty of a Divine Throne Mechanic was strengthening all three
          aspects greatly and creating an entirely new path.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao endured the intense pain of the transformation and looked
          through his interface to see the benefits of the Class Advancement.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   [Key of Adeptus Mechanicus]. Its basic effect increased Machinery
          Affinity by two hundred percent, and its core effect set up a
          Machinery Faith. As long as there were believers who treated him as
          their Machinery Deity, he would receive bonus attributes. The greater
          the number of followers, the greater the bonus.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   There were many different religions in the universe, and the Machinery
          Faith was a special faith in the universe that was crazy about
          technological skills. The followers of the faith worshipped a powerful
          Mechanic and treated him as a Machinery Deity.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After Han Xiao’s deeds resounded through the universe, he had actually
          collected a large batch of Machinery Faith followers, and he would be
          able to gain an attribute bonus from these followers. A Beyond Grade A
          Mechanic who had [Key of Adeptus Mechanicus] could increase their own
          Machinery Affinity.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Mechanic Emperor Manison was an important idol for the Machinery Faith
          and obtained great strength from his followers. Now, Han Xiao also had
          the ability to gain strength from his followers.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This was no different from harvesting crops, and it was the Great
          Mechanic Han’s specialty!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   [Spirit Instrument] could increase the success rate of gold-grade
          blueprints, and he would receive an additional bonus if he was able to
          construct Universal Treasure-grade gold equipment.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   In his previous life, there was a popular saying on the forums. The
          five main Classes represented the five different aspects of a deity.
          The Pugilist represented the ‘Body’, the Psychic represented the
          ‘Mind’, the Mage represented the ‘Control of Laws’, the Esper
          represented ‘Innate Divine Abilities’, and the Mechanic represented
          ‘Deity’s Equipment’.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Although such a saying did not have any proof or theory, it was an
          extremely popular saying.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   [Mechanical Evolution—Creator’s Heart] was his core talent that
          increased his Machinery Affinity by 450%, production efficiency by
          300%, and Machinery Creation Performance by 40%. It was similar to
          [Mechanical Force Ascension—Apostle Body], which also allowed the
          attributes of one’s Mechanical Force to achieve a transformation.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   At the same time, this talent strengthened his personal attributes as
          well. It would provide him with Free Attribute Points based on the
          levels of his Mechanic skills, which included blueprint skills. Level
          4 would provide him with one point, level 7 with two points, and level
          10 with three points.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Most of Han Xiao’s Mechanic skills were basically at the max level,
          and Han Xiao obtained 189 Free Attribute Points. He also had thousands
          of blueprints on him, with the majority of them from gambling. Their
          levels had not been increased yet, and a portion of the blueprints
          provided him with 2,128 Free Attribute Points. This gave him a total
          of 2,317 Free Attribute Points.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Although it could not be compared to the attributes that he received
          from his Promotion, he could add them freely according to his
          preference.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Furthermore, this skill had huge growth potential and provided Han
          Xiao with a new way to increase his Attribute Points.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Knowledge was power. The more he learned, the greater his strength.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Apart from these three new skills, the others were core abilities of
          the [Divine Throne Mechanic].
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   [Universal Simulation] was not a combat ability but a creation skill.
          He could use his machinery to simulate various different celestial
          bodies, natural phenomena, and so on. Apart from being limited by
          materials, he was like the creator. However, this creator could only
          use machines.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   As for the use of this skill, Han Xiao did not understand it fully
          yet. However, he guessed that it should be more of a daily life skill.
          He would be able to break free from the restrictions of blueprints,
          and nature would be his best material warehouse. Since ancient times,
          the starting point of all civilizations that developed naturally was
          from nature.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   [Dimension Factory] was similar to an Emperor Mechanic’s [Secondary
          Dimension Army]. But the difference between the two was that
          [Dimension Factory] allowed him to set up a logistics base in the
          secondary dimension, and he would be able to bring his factory during
          a war, collecting the spare parts in the battlefield and sending them
          back into the furnace to create and repair machines.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The freshly constructed machines could then be sent straight into the
          battlefield. He would even be able to construct equipment on the spot
          to target the enemy’s weakness. It was much more powerful that [Waste
          Modification] and [Advanced Machinery Construction], and it allowed
          him to hold out longer during battle.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   With [Dimension Factory], a Mechanic would not have to worry about the
          lack of logistical support no matter where he went.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   [Virtual Paramount] was an ability that came from his Virtual Mechanic
          branch.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   If he had chosen the Armed Branch, he would have acquired [Sky Dome].
          If he had chosen the Energy Branch, he would be acquired [Energy
          Plasticity].
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   [Virtual Paramount] increased the effects of his Virtual Technology
          skills by two hundred percent and increased his Virtual Technology
          skills by three levels. Its core effect opened up a virtual world that
          only Virtual Life Forms and Virtual Souls could enter.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   There were plenty of uses for this skill. It could be the breeding
          ground for Virtual Life Forms for it to evolve over time. It also
          allowed Han Xiao to build a fortress in the quantum network and
          release a large number of special AI hunters. He would be able to
          intercept information in the quantum network or spread viruses. When
          he used [Virtual Soul] to transform his target into a Virtual Soul, he
          could trap the other party in this Virtual World that was akin to the
          quantum network. The longer his target was trapped in the Virtual
          World, the greater the damage dealt.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao felt that Manison’s slave AI Civilization was dependent on
          this ability.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   [Mechanical Proliferation Growth] and [Strengthened Machinery
          Civilization] were talents to strengthen his mechanical life forms.
          The former increased the efficiency of him transforming a mechanical
          life form and increased the effect of [Mechanical Life Tinder]. The
          latter would strengthen his machinery civilization in many ways,
          including improving their reproductive capabilities and the potential
          of future generations.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   These two talents were extremely important for the Mechanic Emperor to
          accumulate a large machinery civilization army.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   [Apostle Evolution] strengthened the effects of [Apostle Life
          Creation]. It did not increase the number of Apostle Weapon slots that
          he had but increased the combat capability of his Apostle Weapons.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   [Composite Mechanical Deity] was a transformation skill. With his main
          body or Lord avatar as the core, he would be able to combine with his
          mechanical army to form a gigantic mechanical body.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   As long as his mechanical army was large enough, it would be possible
          for him to grow to the size of a planet.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Furthermore, the gigantic mechanical body would have all the
          attributes of the mechanical army, and it was extremely terrifying.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Roaming unhindered through the universe with a gigantic body, that was
          a ‘Mechanical Deity’!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The final blueprint, [Divine Mechanical Throne], was special
          equipment. It was a floating throne that was similar to the one Han
          Xiao had constructed before.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   However, this throne had a special effect. If he sat on the throne, it
          would increase his Machinery Affinity by 1.1x. Thus, it was not
          strange for all Beyond Grade As to create a throne. Of course, the
          biggest reason was still because it looked cool.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao had never obtained so many skills from a Class Advancement,
          and this was sufficient to prove just how terrifying a [Divine Throne
          Mechanic] was.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “My strength has increased a great deal with this Promotion!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Even if the Class Advancement process had not been completed, the pain
          could not suppress the excitement that Han Xiao felt.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He was truly at the level of EsGod, the Mechanic Emperor, and Dark
          Lord after completing his Class Advancement and Promotion at level
          300.
