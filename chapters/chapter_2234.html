<h1>Chapter 2224: External Demons</h1><p>The common belief in later ages is that humans, as the most intelligent beings, are favored by Heaven and Earth’s spiritual energy, thus experiencing tribulations unlike those of other species.</p><p>This claim certainly held true during humanity's peak. However, in ancient times, when humanity was weak and at odds with other races, the unique tribulations became evidence of humanity's alien nature, bringing disaster instead of spiritual growth.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious about the deities mentioned by the spiritualist, as they differed greatly from the deities worshipped by the Daoist court.</p><p>The Daoist court’s deities are imagined and created through the study of talismans and rituals—not true gods, merely "talisman gods."  Judging by the spiritualist's tone, the ancient deities seemed to have been real.</p><p>Where did these deities originate?</p><p>Were they accomplished cultivators who declared themselves gods, or was their origin different?</p><p>“Some believe that humanity was brought into this world by external deities, intending to test the Heavenly Dao.  What's more, some even deem us not just an alien race, but 'external demons,' infiltrating this world with malicious intent! In short, because humanity is not native to this world, we are subjected to its unique Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, why would humanity be so different from other races? This argument is absurd. Green tribulation thunder and gold tribulation thunder are identical in power! Yet, even races similar in appearance to us are linked, labeled 'Outsiders,' and subjected to discrimination…”</p><p>Outsiders!</p><p>Could this be the origin of the Outsider race?</p><p>The spiritualist's following words sent a shock through Qin Sang’s heart.</p><p>He himself was a visitor from another realm.  To think that, in ancient times, the entire human race was branded as external demons!</p><p>In Qin Sang's previous life, his world lacked cultivators—at least, he had never encountered one.  He didn't know what tribulations looked like in that world and couldn't be sure if the 'people' of that world and this world shared the same origin, as the distinction between races in this world is defined by the color of the tribulation thunder.</p><p>If the human races of both worlds are indeed of the same origin, it would prove that humans also flourished in the outside world, making this theory not entirely unfounded.</p><p>“Among the countless beings in the world, are human tribulations truly the most unique?”</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.</p><p>He didn't know much about the demon races, but he knew the Storm Realm's Wu tribe also faced green tribulation thunder.</p><p>Furthermore, there were spirit insects with silver tribulation thunder.  They were even more unique than humans, experiencing only breakthrough tribulations, not the forty-nine or sixty-nine day tribulations.</p><p>As Qin Sang suspected, the spiritualist replied: “Not entirely.  There's also the spirit insect race with their unique silver tribulation thunder. However, it's said this is due to a mysterious connection between their abilities and the deities, or perhaps they are even closer to the Heavenly Dao. Also, spirit insects possess low intelligence and limited abilities before achieving cultivation, making them easy to subdue and less of a threat to other races.  Therefore, the Heavenly Dao doesn't target them as fiercely.  However…  …”</p><p>The spiritualist paused, his tone shifting.  “No matter how close the spirit insects are to the deities, it can't compare to the descendants of the deities.  The true reason is known only to the Heavenly Dao.”</p><p>“Deities have descendants?”</p><p>Qin Sang pressed further, suddenly remembering that in the present world, both the Wu tribe and the Outsider race claimed to be descendants of deities!</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>The spiritualist nodded. This was basic knowledge for any cultivator, although it was far beyond his disciple's current level. Since his disciple was interested, he was happy to explain.</p><p>“It is said that during the age of deities, they existed in human form, reigning supreme. People couldn't communicate directly with them; only tribal shamans could. They possessed shamanistic skills, communicating with Heaven and Earth, receiving the power and will of deities through rituals, prayers, artifacts, incantations, and even dances. Thus, shamans held extremely high status.</p><p>“Ancient texts state:  Their knowledge surpasses the mundane; their sanctity shines far and bright; their brilliance illuminates; their wisdom penetrates all. Thus, the divine descends upon them; a male is called a shaman, a female a witch.</p><p>“In fact, the reason shamans could communicate with deities is their divine bloodline. Deities intermingled with mortals, giving birth to offspring.  These offspring were extraordinary, some even born with part of a deity's power, becoming shamans and ruling the people in the deity's stead.”</p><p>Could this be the origin of the Wu tribe in later ages?</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the *Panhu Sutra*, the Wu tribe's talents and abilities, and various legends.</p><p>He recalled Xin Sheng's tale: at the dawn of creation, primordial deities were born—the first beings after the world's formation. They were manifestations of the Heavenly Dao, born with the Heavenly Mandate.  The Wu tribe claims to be descendants of these primordial deities.</p><p>The Wu tribe claims to possess divine blood, blessed by Heaven and Earth from birth, calling themselves divinely appointed, knowing the unknown and understanding the incomprehensible.</p><p>Their shamanistic incantations are a manifestation of this ability.</p><p>Human cultivators cultivate through enlightenment, gaining understanding from the Heavenly Dao; knowing the why before knowing the what, thereby mastering Daoist techniques for their use.</p><p>The Wu tribe, conversely, seemed innately attuned to the Dao.  They could manipulate celestial power and wield divine might without necessarily understanding the principles involved.</p><p>Therefore, Wu cultivation differed greatly from that of humans.  Legend claimed certain Wu incantations could slay foes from millions of miles away – truly mysterious and unpredictable.  </p><p>The words of Master Tongling confirmed these legends!</p><p>According to this legend, deities were inherently born, nurtured by the Dao, existing since the dawn of creation; other beings appeared only afterward.</p><p>“Deities wouldn't favor only humankind; they must have left descendants among other races,” Qin Sang surmised.</p><p>“A perceptive student indeed!”</p><p>Master Tongling smiled, stroking his beard. He prized his disciple's quick wit and intelligence more than any innate talent; the boy grasped everything instantly and could make connections between seemingly disparate concepts.  A teacher's dream!</p><p>“Deities are impartial and treat all beings equally, guiding them to understand the Dao, embark on the path to transcendence, and leaving their bloodline among various races, leading all to cast off ignorance and build civilization. Sadly, people have forgotten the deities' teachings. However, unlike our human race, those divine descendants weren't entirely innocent.  When the deities were present, some of their descendants abused their power, acting tyrannically, even oppressing the people. Once the deities vanished and they lost their support, years of resentment naturally backfired, leading to their downfall.”</p><p>Master Tongling gazed beyond the mountains. “I hear that outside, some humans have joined forces with divine descendants to resist the oppression of other races, securing a place to live. The Phoenix clan is arrogant, and the Golden Eagle clan, subservient to the Phoenix, hasn’t yet tyrannized humans. The young Eagle King is merely greedy, not a tyrant.  Otherwise, I might have sought refuge there long ago, and you wouldn't have met me.”</p><p>Hearing these secrets, Qin Sang realized he'd been mistaken; this 'Other People' was not that 'Other People'!</p><p>The current Other People and Wu tribes shared many similarities: their ancient legends, and the similarities between the Feather People's war dances and the Wu tribe's shamanistic dances.</p><p>In ancient times, the Other People were likely the shamans  of various demon races!</p><p>The Wu were a blend of deity and human, experiencing the same blue tribulation as humans. The Other People, a mix of deity and demon, faced the golden tribulation. Yet, being divine descendants, they were also shunned by the demon races.</p><p>The Other People appeared human-like, but many tribes retained bestial traits.  Their bodies carried both divine blood and demonic lineage, resulting in diverse appearances and extraordinary abilities.</p><p>In ancient times, the Other People weren't called that; they were known as divine descendants. The ancient Other People probably referred to tribes like the Barbarians.</p><p>While in Duizhou, Qin Sang heard of the Barbarians living between northern Zhou and the Wildlands, caught between humans and demons.</p><p>Times change, and names evolve; it's perfectly normal for racial designations to shift.</p><p>With the current human dominance, the roles reversed. The name "Other People" wouldn't bring calamity; instead, it fostered a closer connection to humanity.  Those divine descendants were once human allies against the demons.  Their name change to "Other People" thus became natural.</p><p>From Master Tongling's account, along with Qin Sang's past experiences and historical records, he could now visualize the shifting landscapes of races and powers throughout the ages.</p><p>In ancient times, deities oversaw the world, and countless beings, millions of races, were born.</p><p>Humanity might have emerged alongside other creatures then, or perhaps later.</p><p>Deities wielded immense power, enlightened beings, and passed on their bloodline, guiding them from ignorance to understanding the Dao – the Age of the Gods.</p><p>For unknown reasons, the deities vanished; order collapsed, and all races rose up – the Demon Court era.</p><p>In this era, people seemingly were unaware of the Demon Realm.  Humans were seen as outsiders; the Wu and the Other People, deprived of divine support, lost their rule over the people and suffered backlash.  The three races were forced to unite against demon oppression.</p><p>Clearly, they succeeded, overthrowing the Demon Court under Yuhuang's leadership, driving the demons into the Wildlands, and ushering in a period of human prosperity.</p><p>But what happened next?</p><p>Why did the Human and Witch clans wage another great war? Why did the Yi people flee to the East Sea? How did the Daoist Court rise and fall? Why did the Supreme Daoist Sect split? Why did Buddhism move to the West? And why did the Ziwu Sword Master's Sword Pavilion become an enemy to the world? When exactly did the Demon Realm invasion begin?</p><p>Furthermore, what was the world like before the Age of Gods? Was it as legends say, with Primordial Gods born at the dawn of creation, and the vast world non-existent before that?</p><p>These remain unclear, and Qin Sang hasn't yet been able to piece it together.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang didn't entirely believe this, as he couldn't be sure if this was the true history of the Great Thousand World or a history played out within this illusion.</p><p>However, considering this illusion managed to deceive even the Jade Buddha and the Thunder Ancestor, it must be of immense origin, and these accounts likely have a high degree of credibility.</p><p>Unaware that his good disciple was lost in thought, Tong Ling continued, "The tides of fate are difficult to change.  I don't know how much longer the Phoenix and Golden Eagle clans can hold out.  Once the situation changes, I will have to take you both away from here."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, wondering how far the place Tong Ling spoke of – where the descendants of the gods and humans dwelled – was from the Golden Eagle clan's territory.</p><p>He suspected that Clan Chief Yuan Xiang and the others might have ended up there. Finding them might unlock the secrets of this illusion.</p><p>For Qin Sang, it was a mixed blessing. The larger the illusion's scope, the harder it would be to find Liuli.</p><p>"Are we leaving here?"</p><p>Affecting a worried expression, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something and hastily asked, "Master, the portraits posted at the city gate a few days ago… the people depicted didn't seem to be ordinary mortals. Did the young Golden Eagle King bring those?"</p><p>"I didn't want to cause trouble at the time, so I didn't use magic to investigate. However, they were likely brought by him.  Those who are being hunted are probably our Human clan companions," Tong Ling nodded.</p><p>"Since these monsters are oppressing our Human clan, the Human ancestors being hunted by the monsters must be good people!  Maybe they were hunted because they fought against the monsters!"</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fists, his face flushed with righteous anger. He tilted his head up, and urgently said, "Master, can we save them?"</p><p>Tong Ling furrowed his brow; he had intended to make his disciple more wary of the monsters, but it seemed he’d gone a bit overboard.</p><p>"My disciple, remember, it is the monsters' world now. Keep what I've told you in your heart, and don't speak of it outside, even to other humans!  People of the same clan aren't necessarily of the same heart.  Think of the two couples under that young Golden Eagle King; they already see themselves as the monsters' servants!"</p><p>Tong Ling earnestly advised.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly calmed down and said crisply, "Master, you are right. I understand.  Master also taught us that great people don't show their emotions easily; only then can they accomplish great things."</p><p>"Good! Good! Good!"</p><p>Tong Ling nodded repeatedly, increasingly pleased.</p><p>"But," Qin Sang frowned, "I still can't bear to see those ancestors killed by the monsters. Mother and Father said that a single twig can be broken, but a bundle of sticks cannot.  If we want to fight against those monsters, every bit of strength is precious!"</p><p>"Yes, my disciple is right."</p><p>Tong Ling was unwilling to extinguish his disciple's pure heart.  After thinking for a moment, he said, "After we return to the mountain, I will contact a few friends and discuss this matter together."</p><p>Qin Sang obediently replied, "I was momentarily angered and didn't think things through. Please correct me, Master.  Saving people will offend the Golden Eagle clan, Master. If it's too dangerous, don't do it. I don't want you to get hurt saving others."</p><p>Seeing the worry in his disciple's pure eyes, Tong Ling felt a surge of paternal affection.</p><p>"Good disciple! Your master knows what he's doing!"</p><p>He looked into the distance and said, "That young Golden Eagle King is already far away. We should also continue on our journey."</p><p>Tong Ling retracted the light barrier, rose on a cloud, and sped towards the mountain gate.</p><p>As they flew swiftly across mountains and rivers, Qin Sang paid attention to the ground below. He saw several places similar to Fengcheng, and there were numerous humans living within the Golden Eagle clan's territory.</p><p>Afterwards, Tong Ling took Qin Sang deep into the mountains. After flying for a while through a desolate area with towering peaks, he pointed ahead.</p><p>"Disciple, look quickly! The mountain gate is there.  That's Yuanjing Mountain ahead."</p>
