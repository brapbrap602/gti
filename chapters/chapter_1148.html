<h1>Chapter 1140: The Demon King's Birthday</h1><p>The spirit of the willow tree noticed Qin Sang's hesitation and whispered, "These three treasure vaults might all contain treasures, or perhaps only one of them does. If you wish to steal the treasures, there is an opportunity coming soon. You can take advantage of the chaos during the Demon King Qianji's birthday banquet to make your move."</p><p>"A demon king hosting a birthday banquet?" Qin Sang was surprised, but then he realized he had made another mistake based on his past experiences. </p><p>Once a demon beast gains intelligence—whether through the enlightenment of the Heavenly Nectar or by transforming on its own—its wisdom is no less than that of a human. Hosting a birthday banquet is not strange at all. Since entering the Heavenly Demon Ridge, Qin Sang had noticed that the demon beasts were even more concerned with etiquette than humans, as if they feared being mocked for their wild nature despite having attained enlightenment.</p><p>"Beasts and spirits, in their ignorant state, do not know the year or month of their birth. We plant spirits are even more so. Thus, most demons consider the day they suddenly awakened their spiritual nature and began absorbing the essence of heaven and earth to cultivate as their birthday," the willow spirit explained briefly before continuing, "After Demon King Qianji transformed, he has held a birthday banquet every sixty years. During that time, Demon King Qianji will leave his cave, and other demon kings familiar with him will send their subordinates to deliver gifts. It will be the most chaotic time in the Ten Thousand Serpent Abyss, and perhaps you can take advantage of the confusion to steal the treasures. The next banquet will be held next year..."</p><p>Qin Sang calculated with his fingers. It was already late autumn, and Demon King Qianji's birthday banquet was only a few months away.</p><p>The willow spirit's suggestion was promising, but they knew nothing about the demon king's treasure vault. Qin Sang couldn't guarantee that he could open it without alerting Demon King Qianji.</p><p>"Qin Gongzi, the old monkey and I still have some strength left. We can sneak in with you," the willow spirit offered.</p><p>"No! You must stay outside and never appear before Demon King Qianji!" Qin Sang refused without hesitation.</p><p>He dared to consider stealing from a demon king for two reasons: first, he relied on several powerful divine abilities, and second, he had partially comprehended the power of the Soul Pearl, making his strength far surpass that of an ordinary Golden Core peak cultivator like Bai. Even if he failed, he had a good chance of escaping. The willow spirit and the old monkey, however, did not have such abilities. If they were exposed, it would mean certain death and would also implicate the Thousand Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Hearing this, a strange light flashed in the willow spirit's eyes, and it nodded silently.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang said, "Please continue to gather information about Demon King Qianji's birthday banquet. Find out if any other demon kings will personally attend to offer their congratulations. Also, before taking any risks, I need to confirm the fastest escape route from the Ten Thousand Serpent Abyss."</p><p>"Understood!" The willow spirit accepted the task and left.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time before suddenly returning to his cave and waking Bai to tell him about his plan.</p><p>"Your escape techniques are strong, but at best, they can only match those of a demon king. However, you don't have the Three Light Elixir, and your true essence is far inferior to that of a demon king. Relying solely on escape won't work," Bai reminded Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang understood that he still couldn't compare to a transformed demon beast, but he had already thought of a countermeasure.</p><p>"I've purchased Mist Illusion Pills and a set of trapping tools. This spirit formation is even more valuable than the Mist Illusion Pills. With you personally controlling it, we can set up an ambush along my escape route. Even if a demon king falls into the trap, it will be difficult for them to break free instantly. At that point, we can calmly choose to escape or use the Twelve Demon Banner Formation to launch a sneak attack..."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang had already planned everything, Bai had no objections and agreed to help him steal the treasures.</p><p>After Demon King Lihong left, the Thousand Bamboo Sea returned to peace. Qin Sang secluded himself in his cave, continuing to refine his sword formation. Unknowingly, another half a year passed.</p><p>...</p><p>The Ten Thousand Serpent Abyss.</p><p>Located south of the Yun Cang River, near the edge of the desert, this place was a labyrinth of countless abysses, crisscrossing like a fishing net, with the longest stretching for hundreds of thousands of miles, connecting to the desert. The Ten Thousand Serpent Abyss was actually just a part of these abysses. After Demon King Qianji took control of it, the surrounding area became his territory and was named the Ten Thousand Serpent Abyss.</p><p>Outside the abyss, mountains stood tall, lush and green. Despite the scorching heat of midsummer, the Ten Thousand Serpent Abyss remained cold and gloomy.</p><p>On this day, sand and stones flew as groups of small demons rode on demonic mist and wind, entering the abyss in droves. The atmosphere inside the Ten Thousand Serpent Abyss was one of celebration. Even the unenlightened small demons could feel the joy, dancing and jumping around.</p><p>Demon King Qianji's cave was located in the deepest part of the Ten Thousand Serpent Abyss, but the birthday banquet was held in the most beautiful spot—by the Dark Lake. As night fell, the area was decorated with lanterns and adorned with night pearls the size of human heads. Beautiful women, like butterflies flitting among flowers, moved gracefully among the strange and grotesque demon beasts, unafraid.</p><p>Golden tables and jade plates were set with fine wines and delicacies, their exotic aromas filling the air. On the stage, human women played music while serpent demons danced. Though their bodies were serpentine, they wore flower crowns, and their scales shimmered in shades of pink and purple. Their vertical pupils did not appear cold but instead conveyed endless emotion, and their dance was enchantingly seductive. Even the occasional flick of their forked tongues added to their allure.</p><p>There was no sense of horror; instead, these serpent demons captivated the small demons even more than the human women. The small demons were filled with excitement, howling and roaring.</p><p>Inside the cave, Demon King Qianji heard the commotion outside and laughed heartily. He turned to the stunning serpent demoness beside him, who was half-human and half-serpent, and said, "My lady, the auspicious hour is approaching. If we don't show ourselves soon, the little ones will grow impatient."</p><p>"Why the rush? If they can't wait, let your favorite concubine accompany you," the serpent demoness retorted, still applying her makeup. She shot him a glance. Though she was half-human and half-serpent, like the snake spirit, she had not yet reached the transformation stage and was only at the mid-stage of the demon core.</p><p>"Ah, she's just a plaything. How could she compare to you, my lady? On my birthday, of course, I must have you by my side to truly enjoy myself!" Demon King Qianji thumped his chest, speaking with righteous fervor. "I've just acquired a batch of excellent spirit wine. It's a pity my father-in-law is too busy to join me for a drink."</p><p>"Fool! Since when does a father-in-law attend his son-in-law's birthday banquet?" the serpent demoness scolded, glaring at him.</p><p>Demon King Qianji laughed. "My mistake! My mistake! I'll personally deliver the immortal wine to him another day."</p><p>The serpent demoness leaned slightly against the demon king, her body exuding charm. She raised her delicate arm and said in a sweet voice, "Husband, aren't you going to help me up?"</p><p>"At your command—"</p><p>...</p><p>The appearance of Demon King Qianji and his wife elicited a wave of thunderous cheers. The auspicious hour had arrived, and the birthday banquet began. Demon King Qianji and his lady took their seats of honor, while the subordinates sent by other demon kings came forward one by one to present their gifts. The small demons under Demon King Qianji's command also offered their tributes, wishing their king eternal blessings and a life as long as the heavens.</p><p>The Ten Thousand Serpent Abyss was filled with the sounds of immortal music, a stark contrast to the desolate desert outside, as if it were a paradise. Little did they know, a figure was already lurking in the shadows, taking advantage of the chaos to sneak toward the demon king's cave.</p><p>"Fortunately, no other demon kings have shown up yet. The guards here are indeed much weaker, and they're all distracted by the banquet, their minds wandering..." Qin Sang hid in the shadows, carefully observing the scene ahead.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>These two chapters make up for yesterday and the previous ones. More to come later.</p>
