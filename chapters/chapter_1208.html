<h1>Chapter 1200: Save Me</h1><p>The information was too scarce, and Tan Hao's whereabouts remained a mystery.  </p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang made a new discovery. He lowered his head to examine the floor, then suddenly flicked his sleeve, sweeping the meditation cushion, spirit array, and other items out of the stone hut.  </p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang extended a hand, his palm facing downward as he pressed it slowly against the ground.  </p><p>The patterns in the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's vision intertwined.  </p><p>*Crack… crack…*  </p><p>The ground, unable to bear the pressure, began to fracture, forming a web of cracks.  </p><p>At that moment, a burst of dark light erupted, causing the ground to collapse and the stone hut to tilt.  </p><p>There was another world beneath!  </p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand casually, stabilizing the stone hut. The Twelve Demon Banners continued to flutter around him, ready to respond to any sudden changes.  </p><p>However, the restrictions beneath the stone hut were unexpectedly weak, far less powerful than the Witch Clan restrictions outside. Moreover, they were clearly set up by a human cultivator.  </p><p>"This matches Tan Hao's cultivation level…" Qin Sang mused thoughtfully.  </p><p>He easily uncovered the secret hidden beneath the stone hut, discovering a vast space below. He entered through a crack and slowly descended.  </p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's feet touched solid ground.  </p><p>He spread out his divine sense, taking in the surrounding terrain.  </p><p>In the center of the space stood a peculiar circular altar.  </p><p>Apart from that, the entire area was empty. Qin Sang noticed some fragments, likely remnants of magical tools or other items that had been destroyed by the impact.  </p><p>Only the altar remained intact, and it was clear that it held some mystery.  </p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to approach the altar, he seemed to notice something. His figure paused, and he reached out to grab a fragment with his hand.  </p><p>The fragment was delicate and translucent, pure white like jade, without a single blemish.  </p><p>"White Jade…"  </p><p>Qin Sang recalled the time they had infiltrated a branch of the Corpse Refining Sect.  </p><p>When the Earth Fiend Qi erupted, he and Yu Daiyue had taken refuge in the Corpse Refining Sect's forbidden grounds, relying on a spirit array with white jade at its core to survive the calamity.  </p><p>The texture of this fragment was strikingly similar to that white jade.  </p><p>"Is this a branch of the Corpse Refining Sect? There's no Earth Fiend Qi here. Could it have been completely dispersed by the upheaval a century ago?"  </p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he swiftly moved toward the altar.  </p><p>The circular altar was adorned with strange patterns, and at its center floated a mass of black mist, condensed and unmoving, its nature unknown.  </p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang couldn't discern the origin of the black mist. Hesitating for a moment, he extended a strand of divine sense to tentatively touch it.  </p><p>"Save me…"  </p><p>The moment his divine sense made contact with the black mist, a voice suddenly emerged from within.  </p><p>The voice was hoarse and grating, like the sound of two metal sheets scraping against each other. It resembled the desperate plea of an old woman who had been parched for countless years.  </p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, and he immediately severed the strand of divine sense. The demon banners around him fluttered violently.  </p><p>The black mist then returned to its normal state.  </p><p>After waiting for a while and confirming that nothing unusual had happened, Qin Sang cautiously extended his divine sense again.  </p><p>"Save me…"  </p><p>The same voice echoed once more.  </p><p>Clearly, this voice wasn't being spoken in real time but had been preserved within the altar, calling out for help.  </p><p>Qin Sang, bold and skilled, used his divine sense to ask a question, but the voice remained unchanged, offering no response. It simply repeated its plea over and over.  </p><p>"Tan Hao must have discovered this altar. Chen Heng must have come here as well. They likely encountered the person calling for help, or perhaps they've already rescued them," Qin Sang thought to himself.  </p><p>Then, he noticed that within the black mist, along with the plea for help, there was also a message: "Save me, and I will impart to you a supreme technique. I swear a Karmic Oath, and you will be richly rewarded!"  </p><p>"Karmic Oath?"  </p><p>Qin Sang silently repeated these words. It was the first time he had heard of such a thing.  </p><p>It sounded similar to a Heart Demon Oath, but the term "karma" was far more mysterious and profound than "heart demon."  </p><p>Karma was an elusive concept, something that even Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't fully grasp. Qin Sang had never heard of it before, let alone Tan Hao and Chen Heng. Who knew what a Karmic Oath entailed or whether it had any binding power?  </p><p>After this message, the black mist suddenly churned, forming an image before quickly reverting to its original form.  </p><p>"This outline… it's the entire Heavenly Scar!"  </p><p>Qin Sang instantly memorized the image and realized that a specific location on the Heavenly Scar was marked, likely as a guide to where the mysterious person was trapped.  </p><p>At this point, the situation became clear.  </p><p>This place was most likely a branch of the Corpse Refining Sect.  </p><p>The sect had fallen, and the branch had long been abandoned.  </p><p>However, a mysterious person had been trapped here, continuously calling for help. The upheaval a century ago was likely caused by this person, aiming to draw people in and rescue them.  </p><p>Chen Heng had been lured here.  </p><p>He must have obtained the Corpse Refining Sect's legacy, but whether he rescued the mysterious person remained unknown.  </p><p>Tan Hao, having acquired Chen Heng's belongings, followed the trail and also discovered the mysterious person's plea for help. He stayed here for a while before leaving and subsequently disappearing.  </p><p>"The marked location might be the Corpse Refining Sect's main headquarters. Communication between the main headquarters and its branches could be achieved through such altars, even capable of remotely activating the altar's power. There are similar records in ancient texts. The sealed mysterious person's nature, whether good or evil, is unknown, but the Karmic Oath is certainly intimidating. However, Tan Hao, eager to save someone, would undoubtedly head to the marked location to investigate, regardless of the oath's authenticity."  </p><p>Having found clues about the Corpse Refining Sect, Chen Heng's whereabouts became less important.  </p><p>Qin Sang analyzed the information, deducing Tan Hao's movements.  </p><p>His biggest question was: Why had Tan Hao stayed here for so long, and where had the Witch Clan restrictions come from?  </p><p>"Tan Hao must have already rescued the mysterious person, which is why no one responded to me. Then, they returned here, using the place as a temporary dwelling before leaving again… Did the mysterious person leave the restrictions behind?"  </p><p>Qin Sang speculated, feeling that this was the only explanation that made sense.  </p><p>The mysterious person was either well-versed in Witch Clan secrets or was of Witch Clan origin!  </p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. The Northern Star Realm and the other three realms had no Witch Clan presence. Could the mysterious person be like Bai, a Witch Clan powerhouse who had survived since ancient times?  </p><p>Where had they gone now?  </p><p>As for why the mysterious person had been trapped and what their relationship with the Corpse Refining Sect was, Qin Sang couldn't guess. He would have to investigate personally to find out.  </p><p>After a long period of contemplation, Qin Sang decided to head to the location marked on the image.  </p><p>His goal was the same as Tan Hao's—to find a way to save someone. He would inevitably retrace Tan Hao's steps.  </p><p>Qin Sang was deeply wary of the mysterious person.  </p><p>If the mysterious person was the founder of the Corpse Refining Sect, inheriting its legacy, they might not be aligned with the righteous path.  </p><p>However, Tan Hao had already gone ahead as a scout.  </p><p>Tan Hao's cultivation was limited, and he couldn't perfectly conceal his traces. As long as he had been to the marked location, Qin Sang would surely find clues and make a calm judgment and decision.  </p><p>Confirming that nothing had been overlooked, Qin Sang flew back to the surface, channeled his true essence, and restored the stone hut's restrictions and all its contents.  </p><p>He didn't know what Tan Hao had done back then or how things had ended. Worried that Tan Hao might have met with some misfortune—that this Tan Hao might not be the same as before—he decided not to leave any messages behind.</p>
