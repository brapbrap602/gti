<h1>Chapter 1334: The Shattered Ancient Illusionary Formation</h1><p>Chapter 1334: The Shattered Ancient Illusionary Formation</p><p>Similar scenes have been repeatedly appearing in the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator from the desert had a similar experience to Qin Sang.</p><p>However, he didn't notice it immediately.  He took a wrong step, stumbled into it, and then vanished without a trace.  Whether he lived or died is unknown.</p><p>The lake water is clear.</p><p>The bamboo forest is fragrant.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath. Despite the serene beauty, he felt a sense of unease. He carefully backed away, circling the small lake, increasing his speed by a third.</p><p>This Purple Micro Palace is not the same as the other Purple Micro Palace.  Even Nascent Soul cultivators will likely struggle to navigate it from now on.</p><p>After bypassing the ancient medicinal garden, Qin Sang hurried for a while and saw a familiar place: the Sword Path Hall, where the teleportation array is located.</p><p>This place was also unrecognizable.</p><p>The sight before him left Qin Sang stunned.</p><p>He stood on the ground, looking up, barely able to see the entrance to the Sword Path Hall from within the multicolored auspicious clouds.</p><p>Originally, this mountain wasn't particularly prominent among the peaks.</p><p>This mountain had grown from the ground like a living thing, its majestic form resembling a sharp sword piercing the clouds, in no way inferior to the Heavenly Mountain.  Some surrounding peaks showed similar changes, but not as dramatically.</p><p>Mountains encircle, one peak stands alone!</p><p>The ebony sword trembled slightly.</p><p>A familiar fluctuation arrived, indicating that the Sword Path Hall's restrictions hadn't changed, and the ancient teleportation array should still be there.</p><p>The good news is that the entrance to the Sword Path Hall remains an ordinary cliff face, showing no abnormalities. Otherwise, this passage connecting the two realms would be exposed.</p><p>“Has the Seven Killing Hall been affected, or is it only the Purple Micro Palace that has undergone changes? Time is pressing. I'll check the other side after this is done.”</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, his figure moving without pause, heading straight for the Sword Scar Mountain.</p><p>Traveling through countless secret realms, Qin Sang and the Sky Eye Butterfly were on high alert.  Their journey was perilous yet ultimately safe, and they finally reached Sword Scar Mountain.</p><p>From afar, they could see the clouds on Sword Scar Mountain expanding, engulfing the surrounding mountain ranges.  Upon closer inspection, as expected, the entire mountain range was under the influence of the illusionary formation.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare act rashly.  He walked around the edge of the formation, reaching the closest point to the sword scar. After investigating, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The sword scar, a wonder of the world, its sword energy endures!</p><p>The scattered sword energy continued to impact the illusionary formation, but was also suppressed by it.</p><p>They were in constant conflict.</p><p>This ancient illusionary formation was indeed dilapidated and full of flaws. While far more dangerous than before, it wasn’t insurmountable.</p><p>No one was around.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly flew out of his Qi Sea, landing on Qin Sang's shoulder, gently fluttering its wings.  Thunderous light gathered on its wings, making it even more vibrant and spiritual.</p><p>Its eyes were deep, as if containing a pure sky within.</p><p>Qin Sang tilted his head, observing the illusionary formation while communicating with the Sky Eye Butterfly, silently activating the Wu tribe's secret arts to help the butterfly use its innate divine ability.</p><p>Amidst the chaotic illusions, Qin Sang found a path, but he could only see the very beginning. He would have to proceed step by step, adapting as needed.</p><p>To be safe, Qin Sang summoned his Nascent Soul puppet, ordering it to lead the way.</p><p>One person and one puppet ascended the mountain.</p><p>The moment they entered the illusionary formation, the surrounding scenery changed drastically.</p><p>The palaces on Sword Scar Mountain disappeared.</p><p>In their place was a wide river of lava, its flow emitting a scorching heat that felt intensely real. The splashing lava waves possessed power that startled Qin Sang.</p><p>However, not far upstream of the lava river was a fault line, as if two worlds were stacked together, causing a conflict.</p><p>With the help of the Sky Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang easily found these weaknesses and navigated the illusionary formation.</p><p>Everything went smoothly. Qin Sang silently calculated the distance.</p><p>He should have already ascended Sword Scar Mountain; barring any unforeseen circumstances, he would reach the alchemy chamber containing the South Bright Netherfire soon.</p><p>At that moment, a sudden change occurred.  The Nascent Soul puppet in front stopped, the crimson in its eyes fading visibly, its gaze becoming vacant.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Sky Eye Butterfly's wings suddenly froze.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a vague consciousness from the Sky Eye Butterfly, then lost contact. Looking down, the butterfly seemed to be asleep.</p><p>He was greatly alarmed.  If the South Bright Netherfire caused an accident to the Sky Eye Butterfly and the Nascent Soul puppet, it would be a huge loss.</p><p>He steadied his mind, scanned his surroundings, confirming nothing was amiss, and then examined himself.</p><p>He found nothing unusual about himself.</p><p>Looking back at the Sky Eye Butterfly and the Nascent Soul puppet, their connection with him hadn't been severed, but they had both fallen into a deep sleep.</p><p>At that moment, the spirit-infused puppet's eyes flickered, as if struggling, resisting something.</p><p>"The jade Buddha again!"</p><p>Qin Sang guessed the reason.  It seemed the illusionary array also affected the mind.  The most insidious aspect was the sudden, unpredictable nature of the change; one fell asleep unknowingly, lost in this place.</p><p>The jade Buddha had saved her again.  Even an ancient illusionary array couldn't affect her.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, increasingly feeling that the higher her cultivation, the more she encountered attacks targeting her spirit, and the more important the jade Buddha would become.</p><p>Eventually, she would have to rely on herself.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the puppet and the Sky-Eye butterflies, her heart growing more vigilant.</p><p>She passed through a series of pavilions and waterside buildings.</p><p>Suddenly, a rustling sound came from ahead, as if something was moving through the woods.</p><p>"Someone?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>On second thought, aside from Ye Laomo, no one could have arrived here faster.</p><p>Why would Ye Laomo come here instead of going to the Tian Shan mountains?</p><p>Qin Sang thought it unlikely. She suppressed her aura, moved forward, hid herself, and waited. Soon, several red foxes appeared at the edge of the forest, playing and frolicking; the noise was their doing.</p><p>She hadn't expected to encounter living creatures here.</p><p>Qin Sang knew these foxes couldn't be real; otherwise, Yun Youzi would have already discovered them. She focused her true energy into her eyes, stared for a moment, and indeed, she found something.</p><p>These foxes looked real, but their bodies occasionally showed strange fluctuations, revealing their illusory nature.  They were indeed spirit beasts conjured by the ancient illusionary array.  The array was damaged, so they were weakened too.</p><p>The red foxes were incredibly lifelike and agile.</p><p>The person who set up the array must have created these beasts for a specific purpose. Even a damaged array, Qin Sang didn't want to test the foxes' abilities.</p><p>But this was the only way to the stone hall!</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering, she noticed one of the foxes stop its playful antics. Its pointed ears twitched, as if it had sensed something.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, and she quickly retreated. The foxes' senses were too sharp. If the array hadn't been so weakened, she would have been discovered long ago.</p><p>She frowned, thought for a moment, and then turned her gaze to another side.</p><p>The sword scar was in that direction. From here, she could already feel the sharpness of the sword energy.</p><p>The origin of the foxes was unknown, so there was no need to force her way through. She could use the terrain to lure the foxes towards the sword scar, using the sword energy to kill them. It was a less strenuous option. (To be continued)</p>
