<h1>Chapter 347: Detection</h1><p>Just then, Liang Yan seemed to sense something. Startled from his meditation, he abruptly looked towards the courtyard, surprise evident in his eyes.</p><p>Heart-Eating Insect!</p><p>Since the fall of the Gloom Yin Sect, Liang Yan hadn't sensed the Heart-Eating Insect's fluctuations for a long time.</p><p>Few Heart-Eating Insect corpses remained within the Gloom Yin Sect. After the sect's collapse, almost all the high-ranking members perished, and the remaining insects were scattered.</p><p>The venomous insect technique created by Patriarch Gloom Yin refined the Heart-Eating Insect into a Gu, divided into three parts: seeding, control, and antidote. Without the antidote method, the poison planted by the Heart-Eating Insect was practically incurable!</p><p>This venomous insect technique was extremely malicious and a closely guarded secret within the Gloom Yin Sect. Only the direct disciples of Patriarch Gloom Yin's major disciples, or those highly regarded within the sect, had the opportunity to learn it.</p><p>Ordinary Foundation Establishment disciples weren't qualified.</p><p>Yue Wu, diligently carrying out Elder Yi's instructions and handling the outer sect affairs of the Gloom Yin Sect, had been taught this technique, even at the expense of his own cultivation.</p><p>Although Liang Yan wasn't qualified to learn this venomous insect technique, he was close to Yue Wu, practically half a disciple, and often assisted him, acting as his right-hand man. Thus, he also learned the control method from Yue Wu.</p><p>At that time, he was only at the Qi Refining stage, yet the Foundation Establishment cultivator controlled by the Heart-Eating Insect was subservient to him, not daring to disobey in the slightest.</p><p>After the Gloom Yin Sect's destruction, everyone fled for their lives. Only a few disciples survived. Those controlled by the Heart-Eating Insect Gu were inadvertently freed.</p><p>The person Liang Yan knew mysteriously disappeared after the Gloom Yin Sect's fall.</p><p>Only those who had experienced it knew the terror of the Heart-Eating Insect Gu. Having finally escaped control, they certainly wouldn't want to repeat the experience and hid themselves very well.</p><p>Over the years, Liang Yan hadn't encountered a single one.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he suddenly sensed the Heart-Eating Insect's fluctuation today.</p><p>"Thinking that everyone from the Gloom Yin Sect is dead after all these years, they can't endure it anymore and dare to show their faces?"</p><p>Liang Yan sneered, not finding it strange.</p><p>Cultivators couldn't cultivate in seclusion forever. Whether encountering bottlenecks or lacking resources, they had to go out for activities and experience.</p><p>For decades, the Yuan Zhao Sect relentlessly pursued the remnants of the Gloom Yin Sect, making no secret of their intentions, and they also had the full support of the Wuji Sect, one of the eight righteous sects.</p><p>Even when a Gloom Yin Sect fiend fled to the heartland of the demonic sects, to Qingyang City on the easternmost edge of Seven Heroes Pass, the Yuan Zhao Sect captured him and hung his corpse for public display.</p><p>This caused an uproar among the demonic sects.</p><p>However, the Yuan Zhao Sect didn't make enemies indiscriminately, only killing Gloom Yin Sect members, and it stemmed from a personal feud.</p><p>Demonic cultivators were inherently callous, and no one was willing to stand up for the Gloom Yin Sect remnants. They merely put on a show, preventing the Yuan Zhao Sect from being so unrestrained.</p><p>Almost all the well-known Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators were eliminated. Even the few survivors were terrified, living like rats, not daring to show their faces.</p><p>Fortunately, Liang Yan was only at the Qi Refining stage back then and hadn't formally taken a master, so he wasn't conspicuous. Otherwise, if the Yuan Zhao Sect had targeted him, he wouldn't be so comfortable now.</p><p>The Yuan Zhao Sect wouldn't bother making a big fuss over small fry like him.</p><p>Insignificant Qi Refining disciples like Liang Yan, after leaving the Gloom Yin Sect, changed their identities. As long as they were careful and didn't expose their past, many could survive until now.</p><p>Of course, they wouldn't be able to learn that venomous insect technique.</p><p>This person didn't expect to encounter him here, did they?</p><p>Liang Yan sensed the Heart-Eating Insect's fluctuation gradually fading.</p><p>This person seemed to have come and gone in a hurry from the Windæ²§ Market, likely just coming in for supplies, indicating their caution.</p><p>Liang Yan's eyes flickered. He calmed his internal Qi, pushed open the door, and walked out.</p><p>The immense power of the Heart-Eating Insect Gu was still fresh in Liang Yan's memory.</p><p>He wasn't sure if this venomous insect technique would be effective against Golden Core cultivators, but he was certain that if the other party was only a Foundation Establishment cultivator, they would definitely become his puppet!</p><p>The stronger, the better!</p><p>Thinking of this, Liang Yan couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement. However, accustomed to caution, he wouldn't be too hasty.</p><p>His divine sense firmly locked onto the movement of the venomous insect. Liang Yan walked out the door, paused slightly, glanced at the room on the right, waved his hand to open the restriction, and walked straight in.</p><p>A beautiful middle-aged woman, Shi Hong, was meditating inside.</p><p>Shi Hong's cultivation was interrupted. She opened her eyes, startled by the extra person in the room. Recognizing Liang Yan, her expression softened, but she remained wary.</p><p>"So it's Senior Brother Liang. Senior Brother has suddenly emerged from seclusion. Is there something you need to do? Perhaps I can assist you?"</p><p>A shadow flickered in Liang Yan's eyes. Ignoring Shi Hong's question, he stared at her and asked, "Have you refined the Yihan Fruit?"</p><p>Shi Hong nodded, forcing a smile. "I've refined the spirit fruit according to the shopkeeper's instructions, without wasting a single bit of its potency. Unfortunately, the Yihan Fruit's effect doesn't seem as powerful as he claimed. The bottleneck remains unbreakable."</p><p>Shi Hong's cultivation was still stuck at the eighth level of Qi Refining, trapped at the ninth level bottleneck for decades, unable to break through.</p><p>Liang Yan gave Shi Hong a deep look and said indifferently, "The ninth level bottleneck is the biggest hurdle in the Qi Refining stage. I, too, went through great lengths to luckily break through back then.</p><p>"However, with your astonishing talent and the assistance of the Yama Banner...</p><p>"Over the years, I've found no less than ten kinds of pills for you, yet you're still trapped by the bottleneck. It's truly unexpected.</p><p>"It seems that spirit roots aren't a cure-all."</p><p>Shi Hong said with immense shame, "It's my stupidity that has disappointed Senior Brother."</p><p>Liang Yan shook his head.</p><p>"It's not me who's disappointed, but yourself.</p><p>"With your age and talent, if you break through now, I can find you a Foundation Establishment Pill, and there's still a good chance for you to establish your foundation.</p><p>"A few more years, and I'm afraid there won't be any hope.</p><p>"You possess dual spirit roots, originally with the potential to reach the Core Formation stage, yet you're stuck at the Qi Refining stage. Aren't you regretful?</p><p>"I intended to become Dao companions with you after you reached Foundation Establishment. Then, we could travel the world as an immortal couple, how joyful that would be?</p><p>"I wonder how much longer you intend to make me wait?"</p><p>Reprimanded by Liang Yan, Shi Hong lowered her head in shame. But, at an angle Liang Yan couldn't see, her eyes flashed with deep-seated hatred.</p><p>"I suddenly remembered something and will be back soon. Stay in the cave and cultivate diligently, striving to break through the bottleneck as soon as possible."</p><p>Liang Yan turned and walked out, closing the door behind him. His expression suddenly darkened, and he snorted, muttering to himself, "Do you really think I don't know what you're thinking? If it weren't for your obedience and ability to handle trivial matters, how could I tolerate you until now!"</p>
