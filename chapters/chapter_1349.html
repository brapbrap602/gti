<h1>Chapter 1341: Blood Infants</h1><p>Qin Sang refrained from asking about Bai's whereabouts, patiently listening to Zhen Daozhang continue.  Bai had broken the Sky Corpse Talisman, but the talisman's core remained within him. As long as neither of them deliberately concealed their presence, they could still sense each other within a certain range through the talisman. However, Bai hadn't reacted since Qin Sang entered the ghost mist. Could the ghost mist even block the talisman's perception?</p><p>"Unexpectedly, before we could approach the altar, Ye Laomo suddenly attacked. He used the surging ghost mist to his advantage. Although we were prepared, we were still scattered, preventing us from forming a defensive formation. I was unlucky enough to be separated, my perception limited, and the closer I got to the blood-red altar, the greater the interference and resistance became. To be safe, I retreated a distance to regroup with some fellow cultivators. Just as we were about to return, Daoist Qin arrived..."</p><p>Zhen Daozhang briefly explained the events.</p><p>"With Daoist Qin here, I'm relieved. Let's quickly regroup with the others. Ye Laomo and the demonic entities are at the blood-red altar; we don't know what they're doing. If there are more demonic entities sealed inside, that would be troublesome."</p><p>Qin Sang understood the situation.  His Heaven's Eye ability was less restricted here; finding his senior sister and the others shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>He looked at the surrounding ghostly mist and blood clouds. "What are these things? Were they here in the Immortal Tomb, or are they Ye Laomo's doing?"</p><p>A Yuan Ying cultivator nearby chimed in, "Daoist Qin, do you remember the Yuan Ying cultivators captured by Ye Laomo? I vaguely saw that those Yuan Ying were refined into blood infants using the幽晶塔 (Youjingta) crystal balls and used by Ye Laomo to form some unknown evil array.  Perception is limited here, with the blood clouds and so many controlled ghosts; it's all likely due to the influence of the evil array."</p><p>Qin Sang looked sideways, remembering that this person's surname was Guan, and he came from the Northern Star Desert.</p><p>"Daoist Guan is proficient in the Thousand-Foot Child divine ability," Zhen Daozhang explained, anticipating Qin Sang's unfamiliarity.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Guan said apologetically, "My Thousand-Foot Child ability requires concentrating spiritual eye power into fine needles to instantly pierce through space and restrictions to see beyond my visual range.  However, it's very draining; each use causes intense pain in my eyes and requires a period of rest. I hear Daoist Qin's spiritual eye ability is also extraordinary. I would be honored to exchange and discuss techniques with you sometime."</p><p>"I would be delighted. After this matter, I will be waiting for you at the Yuanshen Gate anytime," Qin Sang replied gently.  After a moment's thought, he continued, "So, Ye Laomo deceived the Abyss of Sin, stealing the crystal balls and Yuan Ying cultivators to set up this evil array. Daoist Guan, did you see the Jade Bone Brocade Skin, and the demonic entity Ye Laomo released?"</p><p>"The Jade Bone Brocade Skin is floating on the other side of the blood-red altar, alongside Ye Laomo. But it doesn't move, it's unclear if it's alive or its relationship with Ye Laomo," the cultivator surnamed Guan said.</p><p>Zhen Daozhang glanced towards the blood-red altar. "For now, we must quickly regroup with the others. The longer we wait, the more likely things will change."</p><p>Qin Sang agreed wholeheartedly, taking the lead. "I'll lead the way, Daoist, you bring up the rear."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Their formation shifted, with Qin Sang and the Yuan Ying puppet in front and Zhen Daozhang in the rear.  As Zhen Daozhang had said, the closer they got to the altar, the greater the resistance.</p><p>The blood clouds formed a continuous sheet.  The Yuan Ying puppet charged ahead, carving a path through the blood clouds.  Qin Sang followed closely behind, his ebony sword suspended above his head.</p><p>The sword hummed incessantly.  Waves of sword light continuously burst forth, targeting the front, each strike harvesting a swathe of ghostly creatures, but the cleared space was immediately filled again.</p><p>The ghostly creatures surged forward relentlessly, fearless in death, with some even at the Golden Core stage.  They felt as if they had entered hell.</p><p>The others dared not hold back, either summoning their treasures or unleashing their Dao techniques to clear a path. Zhen Daozhang's whisk was almost invisible, transforming into a rain of white light.</p><p>With Qin Sang's help, their speed increased.  While advancing, Qin Sang kept his Heaven's Eye Butterfly constantly utilizing its abilities, not missing a single anomaly, attempting to discern the patterns of the evil array.</p><p>After traveling a short distance, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly finally discovered another group of people. Just as Qin Sang was about to change direction to regroup with them, the butterfly suddenly sent a warning.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. He casually glanced beyond the blood clouds.</p><p>To the naked eye, it looked no different from anywhere else, only the ubiquitous ghost mist.</p><p>But in Tianmu Butterfly's sight, a blood shadow lurked!</p><p>Recalling what the cultivator surnamed Guan had said about the Blood Infant Evil Array, Qin Sang's heart stirred.  Remaining calm, he secretly contacted the others, pretending to wander aimlessly.</p><p>He attempted to approach the blood shadow.</p><p>But several attempts failed. The blood shadow seemed sentient, flickering to another location whenever they neared, proving very cunning.</p><p>However, during this cat-and-mouse game, Qin Sang wasn't without gain; he made a new discovery.</p><p>There was more than one blood shadow!</p><p>These three blood shadows were intricately connected to the blood cloud.  It was likely that the blood shadows were all Blood Infants, controlling the blood cloud and the ghostly creatures, using them to attack.</p><p>Elder Ye had captured a limited number of Nascent Souls.  Eliminating each one weakened the array.  Capturing a blood shadow might help break the array.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to miss this opportunity and secretly conferred with Daoist Zhen, deciding to make a move.</p><p>They circled for a while longer, observing the Blood Infants' movements.</p><p>Fearing that Elder Ye, controlling the evil array, might see through their plan, Qin Sang decided to wait no longer.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Nascent Soul spirit puppet suddenly changed direction, smashing through a clump of blood cloud.</p><p>Simultaneously, all the magical treasures, without warning, reversed course.</p><p>For a moment, multicolored lights erupted.</p><p>A whisk transformed into a shower of light, golden blades flashed, a small seal engraved with unknown ancient characters appeared…</p><p>The Nascent Soul spirit puppet charged forward, displaying fierce energy, and with the cooperation of numerous magical treasures, carved a path for Qin Sang.</p><p>The next moment, a lightning bolt tore through the void.</p><p>Qin Sang revealed his phoenix wings, using both lightning and sword escapes, achieving unimaginable speed. Like a meteor piercing the darkness, he was strikingly brilliant and stunning in the black ghostly mist!</p><p>His target was a seemingly empty space.</p><p>A piercing shriek echoed.</p><p>The Blood Infant hiding there sensed danger and finally emerged from the void.</p><p>Seeing their appearance, a chill ran down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>These Blood Infants were crafted from Nascent Souls, the same size as Nascent Souls, their features still intact, their bodies translucent, merging with crystal balls.  Their minds were completely gone, transformed into terrifying monsters.</p><p>They strained to open their small mouths, screaming at Qin Sang, issuing warnings.</p><p>But surprisingly, the Blood Infants didn't attempt to counterattack.  Screaming, they turned into blood lights and fled, their speed astonishing. (To be continued)</p>
