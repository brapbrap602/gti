<h1>Chapter 877: Cloud Bridge</h1><p>The two of them flew towards the Blue Stone Beach.</p><p>The people on the beach were startled and looked over, some with veiled hostility.</p><p>As they approached, the blue-robed man who had been meditating opened his eyes and looked them up and down. "Are you here to participate in our Smokewater Pavilion's disciple initiation ceremony?"</p><p>"Yes..."</p><p>Fang Ting nodded repeatedly, innocent and carefree.</p><p>The disguised Zhang Yue silently repeated to himself, *I am Zhang Yue*, then said in a deep voice, "Disciple Zhang Yue, I've admired the immortal path since childhood and have long yearned for the Smokewater Pavilion. Please accept me, senior."</p><p>"The initiation ceremony hasn't begun yet. Whether you're chosen is not up to me."</p><p>The blue-robed man saw through Zhang Yue's disguised cultivation level, but his tone wasn't harsh.  A kind smile suddenly appeared on his face. "Find a place to rest. You'll know in two days."</p><p>Zhang Yue thought he was mistaken when he saw the smile on the blue-robed man's face.  *When did these prestigious sect disciples become so approachable?* He realized the smile was directed at Fang Ting.</p><p>The two found separate stones to sit on.</p><p>The others glanced at them, then resumed their meditation, conserving their energy.</p><p>Zhang Yue noticed that the spiritual energy on the beach was more abundant than elsewhere, making it a good place to cultivate. After exchanging a few words with Fang Ting through voice transmission, he also calmed his mind and waited for the ceremony to begin.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang's true body appeared near the lake. He found a hidden spot and concealed himself, secretly protecting them.</p><p>Two days passed.</p><p>More and more people arrived, filling the beach.</p><p>Among them were naive-looking young boys and girls, as well as seasoned cultivators whose eyes couldn't hide their murderous intent.  Some were clearly rebellious.</p><p>With the Smokewater Pavilion's Foundation Establishment cultivator watching, no one dared to cause trouble, and the beach remained peaceful.</p><p>On the third day, just after the yin hour, while the mountains were still shrouded in shadows, the blue-robed man suddenly opened his eyes. "The time has come. The initiation ceremony begins now. Those who wish to join our Smokewater Pavilion, follow me."</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he stood up, summoned a white bamboo staff, stepped onto it, and flew along the lakeshore.</p><p>The crowd buzzed with excitement and followed.</p><p>Each person used different methods; some used magical artifacts, others used teleportation techniques.  Multicolored lights lit up the beach, reflecting beautifully on the lake.</p><p>Zhang Yue flicked his fingers, summoning his bamboo leaf artifact. Fang Ting also summoned her sword light, and they quickly set off.</p><p>The blue-robed man slowed down, leading them around several mountains before arriving at a man-made dock. The dock faced the island in the center of the lake, with boats tied to it.  Behind the dock was a mist-shrouded valley that seemed quite large.</p><p>Everyone landed on the dock with the blue-robed man, their curiosity piqued.</p><p>Zhang Yue scanned the area, his gaze settling on the misty valley.</p><p>The mist blocked their vision, but not the Skyeye Butterfly. Deep within the valley was a mortal town, like a hidden paradise.</p><p>Just then, three streaks of light flew out of the town, passing through the mist. A voice laughed, "Junior Brother Mu has brought everyone."</p><p>"Reporting to the three senior brothers, these fellow Daoists are all the participants in this disciple initiation ceremony."</p><p>The blue-robed man bowed.</p><p>A composed middle-aged cultivator stepped forward from the group of three. He scanned the crowd with satisfaction. "Good. There are more cultivators this year than in previous years. We should be able to complete the task assigned by the Pavilion Master. Junior Brother Mu, protect them. The three of us will set up the Cloud Bridge..."</p><p>The blue-robed man waved his hand, creating a barrier of light in front of the crowd.</p><p>An uproar erupted among the cultivators.</p><p>"Cloud Bridge? I heard the Smokewater Pavilion's initiation used to have three minor trials. I've never heard of a Cloud Bridge!"</p><p>One cultivator exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Another echoed, "Yes! I participated in the last initiation, and it was the three trials. How can it change so suddenly?"</p><p>A thin, sallow-faced cultivator looked despairing, as if all his energy had been drained.</p><p>The dock was filled with noise.</p><p>"Silence!"</p><p>A swordsman beside the middle-aged cultivator shouted. "Who said the trials must remain the same? The purpose of the trials is to assess your performance. If you try to cheat, even if you pass, you won't be able to enter our Smokewater Pavilion. You can leave now."</p><p>Rebuked by the swordsman, the crowd fell silent, no longer daring to speak out.</p><p>The three Smokewater Pavilion disciples each summoned identical bronze mirrors.</p><p>The mirrors flew high into the air and combined above the dock. After trembling slightly, they shot a beam of white light towards the island. Though the distance was great, the light reached the island instantly, connecting the two.</p><p>The mist around the island churned, flowing along the white light towards the dock.</p><p>Gradually, a bridge of clouds formed, spanning the lake. The bridge was entirely made of mist, only three feet wide, illusory and ethereal.</p><p>Everyone worried that they might fall through if they stepped on it.</p><p>As the cloud bridge formed, the white light vanished.</p><p>The mirrors returned to the disciples' hands. Just as they were about to speak, a figure flew out from the island. With a few flashes, a young man with sword-like eyebrows and flowing white robes appeared before them.</p><p>The four Smokewater Pavilion cultivators immediately saluted respectfully. "Disciple greets Uncle Chen!"</p><p>The cultivators on the shore were stunned that such a young man was a Golden Core cultivator. They fearfully followed suit and bowed.</p><p>Zhang Yue lowered his head slightly. The moment Uncle Chen appeared, he had the Skyeye Butterfly cease its ability and fall dormant, lest it be detected.</p><p>With the Skyeye Butterfly completely concealed, Zhang Yue relaxed. He suddenly noticed something strange about Fang Ting. She was staring at the Golden Core cultivator with a mixture of surprise and joy.</p><p>Seeing this, Zhang Yue's heart stirred.</p><p>Uncle Chen raised his hand slightly. "Rise. Are there any among you who possess Heavenly Spiritual Roots, Dual Spiritual Roots, or special physiques that aid cultivation? Step forward, and you may bypass the Cloud Bridge trial and enter directly."</p><p>Triple Spiritual Root cultivators were typically guaranteed entry. Even if they failed the trials, they were rarely rejected.</p><p>However, they were clearly less favored than Heavenly or Dual Spiritual Root cultivators.</p><p>Judging by the situation, being directly accepted as a true disciple by a Golden Core cultivator was not impossible.</p><p>Some special spiritual bodies were even rarer than Heavenly Spiritual Roots. Some were beneficial, some detrimental, and some had no effect on cultivation.</p><p>Zhang Yue noticed that when Uncle Chen spoke, his gaze lingered on Fang Ting with a smile in his eyes.</p>
