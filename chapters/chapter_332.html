<h1>Chapter 325: The Exchange</h1><p>A thousand-year-old spirit herb in exchange for three Soul-Guiding Herbs and nine Heavenly Corpse Talismans.</p><p>Was it worth it?</p><p>“A thousand-year-old Blue Dew昙…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s voice echoed, followed by a streak of blue light emanating from his fingertips.</p><p>The jade box couldn’t conceal the Blue Dew昙’s aura. A dreamy, azure light illuminated a three-meter radius around Qin Sang.</p><p>Instantly, all eyes in the hall focused on Qin Sang, or rather, on the Blue Dew昙 in his hand.</p><p>A thousand years old – a phrase that instantly captivated everyone's attention.</p><p>“The Blue Dew昙 is the main ingredient of the Dew Cleansing Pill. Fellow Daoists cultivating Wood-attribute techniques can use this pill to refine their spiritual power. It can aid in breaking through bottlenecks.”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed many didn't recognize the Blue Dew昙. Taking advantage of the silence, he quickly introduced it.</p><p>Towards the end, a thought struck him. He paused, swallowing the words on the tip of his tongue, and continued in a casual tone.</p><p>“I don't cultivate Wood-attribute techniques, so this Blue Dew昙 has been of no use to me. I happen to be interested in Soul-Guiding Herbs. Would any fellow Daoist be willing to make a trade?”</p><p>Qin Sang had already decided to exchange the Blue Dew昙 for three Soul-Guiding Herbs, regardless of profit or loss. But if he could gain a bit more, it would be a welcome bonus.</p><p>As he expected, the Blue Dew昙’s revealed medicinal properties generated as much excitement as the Soul-Guiding Herb.  Even if only one-fifth of those present cultivated Wood-attribute techniques, that was still a considerable number.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the few individuals he’d noticed earlier, hoping their need for the Soul-Guiding Herb wasn’t too strong.</p><p>It would be a great loss if he revealed the Blue Dew昙 and still failed to acquire the herbs.</p><p>Just then, someone unexpected spoke.</p><p>Gao Yi’s expression had shifted slightly since Qin Sang revealed the Blue Dew昙. He scrutinized it, seemingly verifying its authenticity.</p><p>The telltale, star-dust-like aura of a thousand-year-old Blue Dew昙 couldn't be faked. Confirming its genuineness, Gao Yi suddenly said, “Fellow Daoist, are you sure you want to exchange the Blue Dew昙 for those three Soul-Guiding Herbs?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Gao Yi in surprise, not expecting the Blue Dew昙 to attract his attention.</p><p>The Dew Cleansing Pill was only effective for Foundation Establishment cultivators and couldn't increase the success rate of Core Formation. As a fake Core Formation cultivator, Gao Yi had no need for the Blue Dew昙 himself.</p><p>Unless he was buying it for someone else.</p><p>This unexpected turn of events filled Qin Sang with delight.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Gao Yi was the wealthiest cultivator present.  His interest practically guaranteed the success of the trade.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately nodded, “If Commander Gao offers a reasonable price, I will certainly exchange it. I will not go back on my word.”</p><p>This response left room for negotiation.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t excessively greedy. One thousand-year-old spirit herb could be exchanged for one unused, complete talisman treasure.</p><p>There was still ample room for bargaining.</p><p>Gao Yi didn’t dwell on these details. Unafraid of Qin Sang reneging, he immediately retrieved a talisman from his storage pouch and displayed it, announcing, “I, Gao Yi, will participate in the bidding for the Soul-Guiding Herb. This Gu-Demon Ring talisman treasure is both offensive and defensive, with myriad uses. Its power remains at 70%. To ensure fairness, please bear witness, fellow Daoists.”</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, Gao Yi sent the talisman treasure circling the front row of the hall, allowing others to identify it before gently placing it on a tray.</p><p>Gao Yi's actions were forthright, setting the stage for a contest of wealth. He didn't leverage his cultivation or the power of the Yin Mountain Pass, earning him respect.</p><p>The Soul-Guiding Herb had caused quite a stir, yet this was the first instance of bidding.</p><p>“A Mountain Suppressing Stele talisman treasure. Upon activation, a massive stele manifests, heavy as a thousand jun, unstoppable. Also with 70% remaining power, it should be slightly superior to Commander Gao's Gu-Demon Ring.”</p><p>The woman in red, whom Qin Sang had noticed earlier, clearly had an interest in the Soul-Guiding Herb.  She chuckled, revealing her own talisman treasure and joining the bid.</p><p>Others watched with anticipation, waiting to see Gao Yi's response.</p><p>Gao Yi remained impassive, calmly nodding. "Fellow Daoist is correct. My Gu-Demon Ring is indeed inferior to your Mountain Suppressing Stele. I concede... Are there any other fellow Daoists who wish to bid?"</p><p>"Shadowless Whip talisman treasure…"</p><p>"Starlight Armor…"</p><p>"Third-Grade Azure Lotus…"</p><p>No one had anticipated the number of talisman treasures hidden within the small hall.  Rarely seen treasures appeared one after another, three in total.</p><p>The onlookers were enthralled, witnessing a spectacle beyond expectation.</p><p>Only a few had the means to participate.  The bidding wasn’t fierce, with most carefully considering before placing their bids. Among these treasures, the Daoist's Third-Grade Azure Lotus was of the highest quality.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang began to worry, Gao Hui finally came through.</p><p>"Celestial Spear talisman treasure, offensive type, used only once."</p><p>Gao Hui retrieved the Gu-Demon Ring and produced a new talisman treasure, chuckling self-deprecatingly. "I've brought out my most prized possessions. If any fellow Daoist can offer a talisman treasure of comparable value, I can only add spirit stones on top.  Fellow Daoists need not worry about favoritism. The final decision rests with the owner of the Soul-Guiding Herb."</p><p>This Celestial Spear talisman treasure was practically equivalent to a brand new one.</p><p>With Gao Yi presenting this treasure, the woman in red and others conceded. No one continued the bid, eliminating the need for the owner of the Soul-Guiding Herbs to make a choice.</p><p>This was the shortest bidding war since the auction began, yet its twists and turns, and the display of rare treasures, left everyone exhilarated.</p><p>Gao Hui placed the talisman treasure on the tray, then, without touching the Soul-Guiding Herb, guided the three jade boxes towards Qin Sang with his spiritual power. Qin Sang obligingly caught them and tossed the Blue Dew昙 to Gao Yi.</p><p>Gao Yi opened the jade box and inspected it, nodding in satisfaction.  He pondered, "Fellow Daoist, had the Gu-Demon Ring secured the Soul-Guiding Herbs, I would have offered an additional top-grade magical artifact. The Celestial Spear's value is not much lower than the Blue Dew昙. Therefore... I will cover your auction fees.  Also, I recall you acquired a Phoenix Fall Vine earlier. Do you still require spirit wood? I have a piece of Water-Touching Wood I can offer as compensation. What are your thoughts?"</p><p>“As Commander Gao suggests!”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed in agreement. While the Water-Touching Wood was slightly less valuable than the Earthfire Paulownia, acquiring the Soul-Guiding Herbs was his primary goal. This spirit wood was a pleasant surprise.</p><p>After Gao Yi presented the Water-Touching Wood to Qin Sang, the transaction concluded to everyone's satisfaction.</p><p>Under everyone's gaze, Qin Sang didn't linger over the Soul-Guiding Herbs. After confirming their authenticity, he stored them away and continued watching the auction.</p><p>With the Soul-Guiding Herbs gone, he figured there wouldn't be many items left.</p>
