<h1>Chapter 1201: The Art of Sharp Metal</h1><p>After leaving the Heavenly Corpse Sect's branch, Qin Sang took the fat chicken with him and flew out of the Sky Scar. Arriving at a secluded spot, he unfolded the topographical map given to him by Senior Sister Qingjun, finally confirming the location marked when the black aura of the altar manifested.</p><p>"So it's here!"</p><p>The marked location, which Qin Sang suspected to be the headquarters of the Heavenly Corpse Sect, was situated deep within the Sky Scar, a place difficult for ordinary people to reach. Nearby was a forbidden area of the Sin Abyss!</p><p>That place was known as the Abyssal Ruins, and the entrance to the Palace of Sinful Deities was located there. The knowledge of the Abyssal Ruins in the Cold Domain and the Heavenly Travel Alliance was limited. Qin Sang only knew that the Abyssal Ruins contained more than just the Palace of Sinful Deities, but the entire Abyssal Ruins had only one entrance.</p><p>The Palace of Sinful Deities was discovered by the Sin Abyss cultivators within the Abyssal Ruins and was undoubtedly the most important secret realm, possibly even the core of the entire Abyssal Ruins. To enter the Palace of Sinful Deities, one must first enter the Abyssal Ruins!</p><p>Of course, there was still a considerable distance between the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters and the entrance to the Abyssal Ruins, otherwise, Qin Sang would have to reconsider whether to go or not.</p><p>Looking at the map, Qin Sang thought to himself that the Heavenly Corpse Sect was truly bold. The major forces of the Sin Abyss must have been keeping a close watch on the entrance to the Abyssal Ruins. If the Heavenly Corpse Sect made any mistakes and exposed the location of their headquarters, it would undoubtedly bring great disaster.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "Senior Sister Qingjun once tried to spy on the Abyssal Ruins and the Palace of Sinful Deities, figuring out the defensive forces near the Palace of Sinful Deities. The headquarters is not within the警戒范围. However, the Heavenly Corpse Sect actually hid their headquarters so close to the forbidden area. It seems that all the important branches with altars are also deeply hidden within the Sky Scar. No wonder there is almost no information about them outside."</p><p>Continuing south from the Southern Hidden Mountains would lead to the southernmost end of the Sky Scar, the most desolate and barren place. The marked location was still north of the Near Scar Mountain. Qin Sang needed to retrace his path, cross the Near Scar Mountain, and due to the inability to use escape techniques recklessly, it would likely take another day's journey.</p><p>Qin Sang rolled up the map and quietly headed north, passing the Near Scar Mountain and arriving at the destination. The Sky Scar here was a thousand miles wide. Qin Sang returned to the eastern side of the Sky Scar, standing at the edge and looking west. Even with the vision of the Sky Eye Butterfly, he could not see the opposite shore.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced north again; the entrance to the Abyssal Ruins was still to the north. The defenses there were tight, but Qin Sang's current location was much more relaxed, with patrols no stronger than those near the Near Scar Mountain, making it easy to slip in.</p><p>After a brief pause, Qin Sang leaped into the Sky Scar. The scenery in the upper layers of the Sky Scar was similar, differing only in the level of danger. Of course, this level of danger had little effect on Qin Sang. He strolled through the Sky Scar, quickly descending, brushing past fragments of ancient restrictions without causing any disturbances.</p><p>The dim Sky Scar appeared exceptionally mysterious. Unconsciously, Qin Sang had traversed more than half the distance. The further down he went, the more dangers he encountered. Qin Sang's expression grew slightly more solemn, his escape light like a shadow, silent and swift.</p><p>"Here we are!"</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in a grove of trees, all of which were still alive but entirely black, exuding a decaying aura. His gaze swept across and finally settled on a clearing at the edge of the grove. The clearing contained only a few inconspicuous stones, but this was the marked location. Although Qin Sang knew the method to open it from the black mist of the altar, he did not act rashly. Instead, he first activated the Sky Eye to observe, easily noticing something unusual.</p><p>"Even the Sky Eye Butterfly shouldn't have detected it so easily. Could it be that someone has been here before?"</p><p>At this moment, the fat chicken jumped out, eager to make a contribution, and went ahead to scout the path. Last time, the fat chicken had wanted to do this, but Qin Sang had refused, considering the restrictions of the Witch Clan.</p><p>"Alright, I'll set up a formation outside to provide support. If you notice anything unusual, come out immediately."</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang agreed. He first activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation and summoned the Twelve Demon Banners, standing ready. Then, he shot a stream of light towards the center of the clearing, and the fat chicken standing there disappeared into thin air.</p><p>Not long after, the fat chicken flew out unharmed, "Master, there's no one inside."</p><p>As expected!</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, rolled up the demon banners, and entered the secret realm. Then, his feet felt empty, and Qin Sang found himself in mid-air, with a vast ocean below!</p><p>The fat chicken followed behind Qin Sang, "I just flew around the perimeter. There's only this floating hall in the middle, and everywhere else is empty. Under the water, there's only one altar, directly below the hall."</p><p>Following the fat chicken's direction, Qin Sang saw a black hall built on the water's surface. His figure plummeted, landing in front of the hall's entrance.</p><p>The door was wide open. Qin Sang walked in and saw several shelves and tables, all of which were empty. Clearly, someone had beaten him to it.</p><p>After circling around, he found nothing of value.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to dive into the water to find the altar the fat chicken mentioned when his figure suddenly froze, staring intently at the water's surface.</p><p>"Master, what's wrong?"</p><p>The fat chicken felt a chill, as he had felt nothing unusual and had even dived down earlier.</p><p>"This isn't water, or at least not just water. The water has merged with a strange restriction. If it weren't for the Sky Eye Butterfly, I might have overlooked it..."</p><p>Qin Sang reached out and scooped up a handful of water, and the Sky Eye Butterfly immediately noticed the power receding like a tide.</p><p>"How strange..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. The restriction was integrated into the water, seemingly there and yet not, yet it did not affect those in the water. This was the first time he had encountered such a bizarre phenomenon.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang tentatively entered the water.</p><p>Under the water was a circular altar, similar to the previous one but much larger, with more complex runes carved on it.</p><p>"Indeed, this is likely the headquarters of the Heavenly Corpse Sect!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to himself, parting the water and floating above the altar. Then, his expression changed slightly, and he suddenly reached out into the water, catching a golden thread finer than a needle's tip.</p><p>Sensing the aura emanating from the golden thread, Qin Sang felt a surge of joy, "Sharp Metal Qi! It's the 'Art of Sharp Metal'!"</p><p>The 'Art of Sharp Metal' was the main cultivation technique Tan Hao practiced after forming his Golden Core!</p><p>He continued to act, capturing several more strands of Sharp Metal Qi from other places.</p><p>"Most of the previous speculations have been confirmed here. Tan Hao indeed came here. He made a move in the water, and the residual aura has not dissipated, still sealed by the restriction in the water."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the altar.</p><p>He knew little about the Heavenly Corpse Sect and could only forcefully infuse his divine sense to activate the altar.</p><p>But the altar showed no response, no matter what Qin Sang did, it was like throwing a stone into the sea.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang flew out of the water.</p><p>He had some guesses that needed verification.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang ordered the fat chicken to guard the entrance, lest they be trapped inside without knowing, and sat cross-legged in front of the hall, merging his mind with the Sky Eye Butterfly, staring intently at the water, fully focused on analyzing the restriction within.</p><p>The restriction was vast. Qin Sang started from where he found the Sharp Metal Qi and gradually discerned some clues.</p><p>"This is a seal, but water has no constant form. I wonder where the mysterious person is sealed? The altar might be the channel the Heavenly Corpse Sect uses to communicate with the mysterious person..."</p>
