<h1>## Chapter 1423: A Great Cultivator's Hidden Card</h1><p>Given Elder Hunmo's understanding of the Jinghai Sect.</p><p>If he said he was unclear about the treasures within the Jinghai Sect, Yu Yi Yuanjun wouldn't believe it for a hundred lifetimes.</p><p>Elder Hunmo's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p>Touched by Elder Hunmo's gaze, Yu Yi Yuanjun's heart tightened, yet she maintained the smile on her face.</p><p>Elder Hunmo chuckled lightly, his expression ambiguous, "I cannot hide anything from the Fairy's discerning eyes. This old man has only come for one thing: a sea chart. If the Fairy finds it, I hope you will not hesitate to share it."</p><p>"A sea chart?"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun was quite surprised, misunderstanding Elder Hunmo's purpose, "With the strength of a Daoist friend, crossing the Storm Belt to Beichen Realm shouldn't require a sea chart, right? I heard that you once encountered a mysterious expert from Beichen Realm and sparred with him. Is that true?"</p><p>"Indeed, that person possessed several incarnations, so refined they were divine, and this old man didn't gain much advantage. I made a deal with him, promising not to step into the Beichen Realm for three hundred years."</p><p>Elder Hunmo admitted frankly, then his tone shifted, "This old man has no intention of breaking his promise. That sea chart points to another place."</p><p>"Another place?"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun was first puzzled, then her beautiful eyes suddenly widened, "The Central Continent! The legendary Central Continent truly exists! The Jinghai Sect has a sea chart leading to the Central Continent?!"</p><p>Elder Hunmo remained noncommittal, asking instead, "Does the Fairy also know of the Central Continent?"</p><p>"I thought it was just a legend, I didn't expect it to be true. The Northern Sea really has a path to the Central Continent…"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun exhaled lightly, calming her thoughts, "This path only exists in legends, and no one knows if it truly exists. Why are you so certain that the Jinghai Sect possesses a treasured sea chart?"</p><p>Elder Hunmo raised his black bamboo staff and tapped the Jinghai Sect below, "Don't you find it strange? The Hokkaido Sect and the Demonic Path are flourishing, but Buddhist cultivation sects are all second-rate, their inheritance severed, with only a handful of Golden Core cultivators. Why did such a powerful Buddhist sect appear out of nowhere, and remain unknown?"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun understood the implication, and her face filled with disbelief, "Are you saying that the Jinghai Sect is from the Central Continent? How is that possible?"</p><p>"It's just this old man's guess," Elder Hunmo laughed, unwilling to say more on this matter, then changed the subject, "If the Fairy is interested, once I obtain the sea chart, I can share it with you. Once the Fairy breaks through to the late Nascent Soul stage, we might be able to travel to the Central Continent together, providing mutual support."</p><p>"Late Nascent Soul stage, ha!"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun shook her head with a bitter smile, offered her thanks, and asked cautiously, "Can one safely cross the Storm Belt and reach the Central Continent at the late Nascent Soul stage?"</p><p>"We'll have to obtain the sea chart and try it to find out. However, if this old man is fortunate enough to break through to the Spirit Transformation stage, I probably won't need the sea chart," Elder Hunmo stroked the bamboo staff in his hand, speaking uncertainly.</p><p>……</p><p>In front of the Buddha Pagoda.</p><p>The three landed on the ground one after another.</p><p>The thirteen-story Buddha Pagoda was towering, each story being the height of two men.</p><p>The Buddha Pagoda was made of stone, the doors and windows tightly closed, and carved with unknown Arhats and Buddhas, lifelike, as if they were gazing at the intruders.</p><p>The entire surface of the Buddha Pagoda was covered with a layer of golden radiance, a unique Buddhist prohibition.</p><p>The area here seemed quite dim, the power of the prohibition not as strong as at the Golden Summit.</p><p>The Buddha Pagoda had already been visited by Ghost Mother.</p><p>However, in order to keep the seal lasting longer, Ghost Mother acted very carefully, not completely destroying the prohibition of the Buddha Pagoda, and on the surface, no traces left by human hands could be seen.</p><p>They looked up for a while. The Buddhist prohibition was unfamiliar to them, so they could only use brute force.</p><p>Because they could not see the inside of the Buddha Pagoda, they did not know that it had already been ransacked. In their view, the prohibition here was damaged by the impact of the Scarlet Flame due to the seal.</p><p>No one noticed that the eyes of Precept Keeper Zhenren were somewhat abnormal at this moment.</p><p>He was not as excited as before, staring at the scripture depository base next to the thirteen-story Buddha Pagoda, on the verge of tears.</p><p>"Let's do it!"</p><p>Precept Keeper Zhenren sighed, offering a needle-shaped magical artifact specifically for breaking prohibitions.</p><p>The other two also did not want to fall behind.</p><p>Precept Keeper Zhenren raised his magical artifact, about to make a move, but inexplicably felt a hint of unease in his heart, then felt a chill emerge out of nowhere on his left shoulder, startled.</p><p>"Don't move!"</p><p>A cold warning came from his ear.</p><p>Elder Hunmo!</p><p>Precept Keeper Zhenren's whole body stiffened, and a storm raged in his heart.</p><p>He immediately remembered what was lying on his shoulder. Before, when he ambushed Valley Master Mu, he had seen it with his own eyes. It was a ghost-like existence, very strange.</p><p>If Valley Master Mu hadn't used a unique protective treasure, Valley Master Mu wouldn't have escaped, and all three of them would have died in Elder Hunmo's hands.</p><p>Before becoming a Great Cultivator, Elder Hunmo was already notorious. His enemies often died suddenly, but later, the cause could not be found, most likely due to this ghost spirit's ability.</p><p>Precept Keeper Zhenren didn't even know when the trick had been played.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun and the others were right next to him, but they hadn't noticed anything abnormal!</p><p>"No! No way in front of so many people! He must have planted this ghost spirit on me during the ambush on Valley Master Mu, he has always been wary of me..."</p><p>Precept Keeper Zhenren's mind raced, thinking of a possibility.</p><p>"I know what you're looking for," regardless of what Precept Keeper Zhenren thought, Elder Hunmo's voice was still cold and indifferent, "You shouldn't have hidden it from me… I owe your master a favor. If you get the Soul Suppressing Incense (Town Spirit Incense), I can forgive your past transgressions."</p><p>Hearing the three words Soul Suppressing Incense.</p><p>Precept Keeper Zhenren had no more luck left, feeling half of his body was about to be frozen stiff, struggling to maintain his expression unchanged, and said repeatedly: "It was this junior's momentary confusion, I was blinded by greed, I hope Senior will forgive me. But... the scripture depository has been destroyed. Master said that the Soul Suppressing Incense is not in the Buddha Pagoda, but is treasured together with the refining method in the scripture depository, I'm afraid it's..."</p><p>He dared not hide anything and revealed everything he knew.</p><p>Elder Hunmo didn't seem surprised, sighing slightly, "As expected, it was in the scripture depository... No wonder your mood was so low just now. Go, open the Buddha Pagoda and see what's inside."</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators can control their emotions.</p><p>However, some people may not want to control them, because it is not necessary.</p><p>In addition, ripples inevitably appear at times of sorrow and joy. After all, they are people, not dead objects.</p><p>Precept Keeper Zhenren went through a lot of trouble, thinking he was about to achieve his goal, but found that even the ruins of the scripture depository were gone, and his mood can be imagined.</p><p>Emotional fluctuations could even be detected by the possessed ghost spirit.</p><p>Precept Keeper Zhenren's mind was tense, becoming even more fearful of Elder Hunmo's methods.</p><p>After a while, Precept Keeper Zhenren cautiously approached the Buddha Pagoda, raised the needle-shaped magical artifact, and attacked the Buddhist prohibition woodenly.</p><p>The two people next to him did not notice his abnormality.</p><p>……</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Inside the Medicinal Garden (Herb Garden).</p><p>Qin Sang and Tan Hao were busy, picking the most valuable spiritual herbs.</p><p>Tan Hao had received guidance from Ghost Mother and had been in the Jinghai Sect for a long time, so he was very familiar with the prohibitions here.</p><p>Under Tan Hao's guidance, Qin Sang personally took action. When breaking the prohibitions, the anomalies were very weak and would not be discovered by people outside.</p>
