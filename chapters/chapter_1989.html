<h1>Chapter 1980: Wheel of Life and Death Reversal</h1><p>The White Tiger's baleful aura wasn't the end, but merely the beginning!</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Sword Formation in the south, the White Tiger Sword Formation in the west, both arrays manifested simultaneously.  Stars filled the sky, as if the real night sky had been brought down.</p><p>In fact, the sword-stars within the formation truly corresponded to the seven mansions of the White Tiger in the west and the seven mansions of the Vermilion Bird in the south. However, attempting to break the formation based on real star charts would only lead to a grave mistake, inevitably falling into the enemy's trap.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu could see through this at a glance.  The sword formation imitated the celestial phenomena, but it never placed the hope of breaking the formation on this principle. This was the very reason why.</p><p>The starlight of the myriad stars seemed to converge upon Patriarch Minghu alone.</p><p>He hung suspended within the sea of stars, isolated and without support, his face darkening.</p><p>The Unbounded Corpsewalk wasn't truly unbounded.</p><p>The Three Enclosures, Four Symbols, and Twenty-Eight Mansions—once the star chart was complete, what kind of power would the sword formation possess?</p><p>Currently, only the two symbols of the Vermilion Bird and White Tiger, comprising fourteen mansions, were visible. Was it because the master of the sword formation was lacking in power, or was he gradually depleting his own strength?</p><p>Patriarch Minghu felt the infuriating sensation of being treated as a plaything, manipulated in the palm of someone's hand.</p><p>It had been a long time since he felt this way, but he didn't lose his reason due to anger. His cold gaze swept towards the edge of the sea of stars.</p><p>At the edge of the sea of stars, faint starlight flickered, as if a lingering resonance remained.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly wasn't planning to give him much time to think.  A tiger roared through the starry sky, and at the point where the starlight was most intense, a white tiger appeared, leisurely pacing among the stars, its tiger eyes filled with ferocity and killing intent as it looked towards Patriarch Minghu.</p><p>Echoing the tiger's roar, a long cry resounded from the south.</p><p>It was evident that this cry attempted to emulate the cry of a phoenix, but it lacked the sanctity and aloofness of the king of birds, sounding grotesque and incongruous, like a self-satisfied crow.</p><p>The momentum, however, was not lacking.</p><p>The starlight seemed to ignite, a raging inferno burning through half the sky, sweeping away the darkness.</p><p>Within the sea of fire, a Vermilion Bird was born from the flames.</p><p>Majestic and awe-inspiring, the divine bird that controlled fire in the mortal world was no different.  It complemented the baleful aura of the White Tiger.</p><p>However, the Vermilion Bird's eyes darted around restlessly, its gaze cunning, detracting from its majesty and explaining the strange cry.</p><p>But it was precisely because of this that this Vermilion Bird possessed a spirituality that the baleful White Tiger lacked.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu keenly perceived the difference between the two.  Just as he was about to observe more closely, the place where he stood was illuminated by the firelight.</p><p>The auras of the two sacred beasts rapidly approached from the sky, sharp to the extreme.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu immediately felt the illusion of his physical body being pierced.</p><p>They weren't like two sacred beasts, but more like two incredibly sharp spiritual swords, fiercely thrusting towards him.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu knew that to break the formation, he had to defeat these two sacred beasts first. The enemy had fully grasped the initiative, and his situation hadn't improved in the slightest.</p><p>However, his previous use of the Unbounded Corpsewalk wasn't completely without effect.</p><p>A faint, ethereal light appeared on Patriarch Minghu's forehead, and his features suddenly stiffened.</p><p>After continuous battles, his body was covered in wounds, but his face remained unscathed.</p><p>The rigid features, the sneer filled with killing intent, and the withered skin resembled a skull covered with a layer of skin, eerie and sinister.</p><p>The ethereal light on his forehead rapidly transformed, revealing a curved rune. Then, a clear outline appeared around the rune, resembling a mortuary tablet!</p><p>The tablet protruded, taking on a dark red color. At first glance, it appeared to be made of wood, but upon closer inspection, it possessed a gem-like luster.</p><p>Qin Sang, high in the sky, saw the tablet and inwardly grew wary. The tablet posed a greater threat than the Everbright Lamp; it must be a treasure that Patriarch Minghu relied heavily upon.</p><p>The tablet detached from Patriarch Minghu's forehead, spun in front of him, and grew in the wind.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the tablet transformed into a hundred-foot-tall stone stele, exceptionally heavy.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>At this moment, the auras of the Vermilion Bird and White Tiger were close at hand, the flames brought by the Vermilion Bird turning the area around Patriarch Minghu into a sea of fire.</p><p>The two ferocious beasts attacked from both sides, flanking Patriarch Minghu!</p><p>The full power of the sword formation erupted without reservation, using this Undying Bone to test the fruits of Qin Sang's years of cultivation.</p><p>The roars of the tiger and the cries of the bird shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>The two sacred beasts displayed unparalleled ferocity, as if they wanted to tear apart the world.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu, bearing the brunt of the attack, his eyes flashing, caused the void to tremble violently.</p><p>The source was the tablet.</p><p>With just a slight tremor from the tablet, visible ripples appeared in the void, revealing its immense weight.</p><p>If it struck a mountain, it could easily shatter the peak. If it struck a person, it would leave only a puddle of gore!</p><p>Patriarch Minghu reached out and grasped the base of the tablet, his knuckles tightening, and abruptly swung it.</p><p>The tablet was as light as a feather in Patriarch Minghu's hands, as if he were swinging a door panel, smashing it against the enemy.</p><p>It was hard to imagine such a simple and brutal scene in a battle between Void Refinement cultivators.</p><p>Yet, its power was no less than any divine ability or Daoist art.  Subtle ripples spread across the surface of the tablet, like flickering Yin thunder, or cracks in the void.  No one would doubt its ability to pulverize any enemy.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A fierce wind howled.</p><p>Qin Sang "heard" the Vermilion Bird squawking, wanting to flee the battle.</p><p>This foolish bird really thought that Void Refinement cultivators were easy to provoke.  Earlier, when it heard that Qin Sang had invited it to assist, it was extremely excited.</p><p>If it weren't integrated into the sword formation, a single strike from the tablet could extinguish the Vermilion Bird along with its flames.</p><p>Now it was too late to escape; once integrated into the sword formation, it was no longer under its own control.</p><p>Ignoring the Vermilion Bird's heart-wrenching screams, Qin Sang spared no effort in activating the sword incantations.</p><p>Shooting stars suddenly appeared within the sea of stars, the positions of the stars shifting, and starlight streaking across, leaving prominent trails.</p><p>Every sword-star was so brilliant and dazzling, the power of the entire sword formation mobilized by Qin Sang, infused into the two sacred beasts.</p><p>Facing the incoming tablet, the Vermilion Bird and White Tiger didn't retreat, colliding head-on!</p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>If the abyss hadn't been sealed by the sword formation, the impact of this collision would have been even more terrifying than the previous clashes.</p><p>The resulting storm engulfed Patriarch Minghu and the two sacred beasts.</p><p>The starlight in the sky flickered.</p><p>The three figures separated upon contact, the White Tiger and Vermilion Bird both flying back into the sky, as if they had been swatted away by the tablet.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spread its wings, tracing a graceful arc in the void, its eyes filled with lingering fear and fury.</p><p>The White Tiger appeared more disheveled, tumbling a few times before stabilizing itself, roaring towards the ground below.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu retreated farther than them, the tablet in his hand springing back, nearly striking his own chest. He let out a muffled groan.</p><p>In the next moment, the Vermilion Bird, cursing Qin Sang, joined the White Tiger in launching another fierce attack.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu could only repeatedly swing the tablet with vigor, as if swatting flies. However, the enemies weren't as weak as flies; every strike was accompanied by terrifying sword intent.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu was gradually forced into a corner.</p><p>It seemed that Qin Sang had gained the upper hand, but he still wasn't satisfied.  In the intervals between casting sword incantations, he activated the Thunder Crucible and Dharma Talismans within his body.</p><p>Before the thunder appeared, the might of thunder permeated the sword formation.</p><p>Immediately, a bolt of lightning pierced the sea of stars, revealing a thunder rune—the Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu instantly sensed the anomaly.</p><p>He wasn't surprised that the enemy had other means.</p><p>If this was the extent of his opponent's abilities, once he stabilized his footing, he might still be able to snatch victory from defeat.</p><p>Unexpectedly, his opponent also excelled in thunder arts. Thunder arts, being supremely yang in nature, inherently countered corpse demons and evil spirits.  His current situation made him even more cautious.</p><p>His eyelids slightly lowered, Patriarch Minghu delivered a powerful blow, forcing back the White Tiger and Vermilion Bird. His hair and beard danced wildly as gray corpse Qi emanated from the back of his head.</p><p>After a distortion, a human face emerged from the back of his head.</p><p>This face was exceptionally young, forming a stark contrast to his front face, but there was a resemblance in their features, like a younger Patriarch Minghu.</p><p>A pair of cold eyes, as soon as they opened, fixed on the sky.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu battled the two sacred beasts, and no matter how he moved and shifted, those back eyes remained locked on what was above.</p><p>The Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman unleashed countless lightning bolts, like a vast net, weaving the stars within the lightning net.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>A lightning bolt struck towards Patriarch Minghu.</p><p>Besieged by sacred beasts, struck by heavenly lightning!</p><p>Patriarch Minghu's back eyes suddenly transformed into black demonic pupils, emitting a tangible gaze, like a bolt of Yin thunder.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The Yin thunder collided with the heavenly thunder, scattering lightning threads.</p><p>Immediately afterward, lightning rained down, but it was all intercepted by the Yin thunder emanating from the demonic pupils, failing to cause much trouble for Patriarch Minghu.</p><p>When the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Thunder Summoning Talisman and the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal Talisman were subsequently deployed by Qin Sang…</p><p>The three talismans combined, thunder and fire filled the sky, almost obscuring the starlight.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu finally felt the pressure and took out a piece of jade, which was held in the mouth of the face on the back of his head.</p><p>This piece of jade emitted traces of chilling Yin energy, its interior having absorbed an unknown amount of Yin Qi—it was a piece of Yin jade.</p><p>With the Yin jade in his mouth, the power of the Yin thunder surged dramatically.  Facing the suspended Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal, it actually clashed head-on, as Patriarch Minghu condensed a pool of Yin energy.</p><p>Heavenly thunder bombarded relentlessly, and the Yin pool appeared on the verge of collapse, yet it remained remarkably resilient.</p><p>Finally, Patriarch Minghu even crushed the Yin jade, releasing boundless Yin Qi into the Yin pool.</p><p>As a result, Patriarch Minghu kept retreating, but Qin Sang still couldn't inflict any serious injuries.</p><p>"Against a veteran Void Refinement cultivator, I'm indeed still somewhat lacking," Qin Sang inwardly sighed.</p><p>In fact, the Four Symbols Sword Formation and the Daoist Dharma Talismans contained a grand heritage that Patriarch Minghu couldn't compare to.</p><p>If Qin Sang could master even one of them profoundly, this battle would be much easier, and surpassing his cultivation level would be possible.</p><p>What he lacked was time!</p><p>Qingyuan had taught him the "Palm Thunder Vision" technique. If he had patiently comprehended it and used the Azure Phoenix True Thunder to form the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal Talisman, Patriarch Minghu would probably have only been able to flee.</p><p>After considering, Qin Sang believed that the sword formation might be more useful, so he dedicated most of his energy to studying the Four Symbols Sword Formation.</p><p>"This is enough..." Qin Sang murmured to himself.</p><p>He was satisfied with forcing Patriarch Minghu to this point with two half-baked divine abilities.</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang's expression suddenly changed.  At the same time, the Vermilion Bird's heart-wrenching scream echoed, "Qin! Let me go back! I'm going to die! I'm going to die!"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird's panic wasn't feigned.</p><p>Qin Sang also felt a sense of foreboding. His eyes gleaming, he stared intently at Patriarch Minghu, who was emanating an unusual aura.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu continuously retreated but couldn't find any openings in his enemy's defenses.</p><p>He knew he couldn't continue like this. Otherwise, once his opponent joined forces with Gu Yunsou, he might have to worry not about defeat, but about his own safety!</p><p>Wheel of Life and Death Reversal!</p><p>Both faces, front and back, moved simultaneously, their lips opening and closing, as if chanting the same incantation.</p><p>At the same time, the illusory image of a rotating wheel appeared above Patriarch Minghu's head.</p><p>The wheel was half black and half white, corresponding to the front and back of Patriarch Minghu's body. The front was white, and the back was black.</p><p>The withered face on the front represented current life, while the youthful face on the back represented past death.</p><p>The cycle of life and death, profound and unpredictable.</p><p>Wheel of Life and Death Reversal!</p><p>This was the great divine ability that Patriarch Minghu had cultivated in seclusion for many years.  Because it hadn't been fully mastered, it required much preparation before activation.</p><p>Even so, both Qin Sang and the Vermilion Bird felt an immense threat.</p><p>The black and white wheel gradually solidified, then slowly began to rotate.  The rotation speed was slow, yet it seemed to pull at both Qin Sang's and the Vermilion Bird's minds.</p><p>It wasn't just the wheel that seemed to be reversing, but their very lives!</p><p>Once life and death reversed, it would be the moment this divine ability erupted.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird was truly terrified. If it were caught in the Wheel of Life and Death Reversal, it probably wouldn't even know how it died.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, inwardly acknowledging that veteran Void Refinement cultivators truly possessed profound foundations, not to be underestimated.</p><p>He wouldn't use the sword formation to clash head-on with Patriarch Minghu.</p><p>This entanglement was only to gauge his own strength. The Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal was also meant to deceive Patriarch Minghu, the true killing move still to come!</p><p>With a thought, the White Tiger and Vermilion Bird abandoned their fierce assault and returned to the sea of stars, merging into the stars with a flicker.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang had retreated since the battle began.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu assumed that his opponent was wary of his divine ability and was preparing to withdraw, seeing that the situation was unfavorable.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the starlight and lightning in the sky not only didn't dissipate but continued to expand, incorporating nebulae one after another.</p><p>The vastness of the sea of stars was sufficient to accommodate the Four Symbols and Twenty-Eight Mansions.</p><p>Moreover, during the expansion of the sea of stars, an indescribable change occurred within the sword formation.</p><p>…</p><p>"Clang!"</p><p>The chess piece in Gu Yunsou's hand fell onto the board, his face filled with shock.</p><p>"Sword Domain!"</p><p>He displayed a clear loss of composure for the first time.</p><p>Upon seeing Xiao Wu and Qin Sang's Dharma Body, he hadn't lost his composure, remaining calm enough to play chess with Qin Sang.</p><p>He thought his delaying tactic, while Qin Sang's Dharma Body and Patriarch Minghu were fighting, allowed him to silently assess whether he should intervene.</p><p>The temptation of the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar was too great.  Rather than letting someone monopolize it, it would be better to join forces with the old corpse and split it equally between them.</p><p>But upon sensing the fluctuations emanating from the battlefield, he completely abandoned those thoughts.</p><p>A Domain, a great divine ability comprehensible only at the Body Integration stage.</p><p>Although he was traveling with a Dharma Body, his true body remained in the sect. However, once pulled into a Domain, the Return to Origin technique would lose its effectiveness.</p><p>If his Dharma Body were destroyed, his true body would be left barely clinging to life.</p><p>Regarding Domains, he had only heard rumors of these secrets, but it was enough to shock him into this state.</p><p>The Daoist before him clearly only possessed early Void Refinement cultivation, yet he had mastered a Domain.</p><p>Both at the early Void Refinement stage, he himself had wasted many years, having only touched upon the bottleneck of mid-Void Refinement.  He didn't even have a clue, let alone know in which direction the "gate" to a Domain opened.</p><p>Gu Yunsou was horrified, his body chilled.  Could it be that some great power was playing a joke on him?</p><p>…</p><p>Evolving the Sword Formation into a Sword Domain was just one part of the plan.</p><p>Qin Sang's hand seals changed rapidly, his gaze shifting as he looked towards the south.</p><p>Qingyang Temple!</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The Thunder Crucible, which had remained dormant until now, suddenly trembled violently, the might of thunder sweeping across heaven and earth.</p><p>Qin Sang finally activated the last thunder restriction.</p><p>A dazzling beam of thunder shot straight towards the heavens.</p>
