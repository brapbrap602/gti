<h1>Chapter 1665: Unleashing the Demon</h1><p>Chapter 1665: Unleashing the Demon</p><p>They led Su Nu into the mountain valley.</p><p>In the center of the valley stood a weathered stone stele, unremarkable in appearance, its age unknown.  Rough stones littered the area around it, creating a desolate scene.</p><p>Strangely, there were no graves, and the stele was uninscribed, its surface merely showing the effects of time and erosion – a blank monument.</p><p>They stopped before the stele. First, they set up a hidden restriction above the valley. Then, after a moment’s hesitation, they simultaneously formed hand seals, their true energy surging into their hands.</p><p>Their true energy was infused with a demonic aura; behind each of them, a three-headed, six-armed demonic shadow materialized.</p><p>Su Nu was intimately familiar with this demonic aura, and her face showed shock.</p><p>The three leaders of the Merchant Alliance, publicly unconnected to the demonic path, even considered thorns in the Demon Lord's side, were actually proficient in demonic arts and could wield this demonic energy!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Three condensed hand seals struck the stele simultaneously.</p><p>A black light suddenly flickered across the weathered stele before returning to normal.  Then, a faint sigh emanated from within the stone.</p><p>“Sigh… I’ve waited hundreds of years. You’ve finally come…”</p><p>The voice was weak, yet paradoxically raspy and unpleasant, like two pieces of metal scraping together, shrill and grating.</p><p>Su Nu’s pupils dilated; her eyes glazed over.  Her last shred of hope vanished.  A great demon was truly sealed here!</p><p>At the stele’s base, wisps of black energy seeped out from below, but were contained by an unknown force, unable to break the seal.  It was flattened at the bottom of the stele, forming a grotesque face.</p><p>The face’s features were twisted and inhuman.</p><p>Stared at by its empty eyes, a chill ran down their spines.</p><p>“All at the peak of mid-Yuan Ying stage, not bad! You haven’t disappointed me. My personal guidance, the sacred clan’s supreme technique… wasn’t there supposed to be more of you?”</p><p>The three leaders looked at the grotesque face, their expressions varied.  They exchanged a glance. The Dongji leader stepped forward and bowed.  “Your Majesty, after receiving your guidance in the outer hall, we followed your orders, plotting to build our power, gathering resources to help you break the seal. However, our cultivation was low at the time, and two of our senior brothers unfortunately provoked powerful enemies, meeting with… accidents. We had to lie low and find another way…”</p><p>The being sealed within the stele was actually the ancient demon lord!</p><p>“The Merchant Alliance?”</p><p>The demon lord showed no concern for the deaths of his two disciples, chuckling grotesquely.  “I remember you saying that in this era, not even a Nascent Soul cultivator could be found among the cultivators. In this age of declining spiritual energy, as my direct disciples, you couldn’t become overlords, so you could only form a merchant alliance, bowing to others?”</p><p>In the Canglang Sea, the three great merchant alliances were already powerful forces second only to the righteous and demonic sects. Yet, the demon lord spoke with sarcasm, disdaining the three leaders.</p><p>Never had the three leaders suffered such mockery.</p><p>Xi You’s leader raised an eyebrow, her pretty face flushed with anger. “If you hadn’t secretly tampered with us, causing our true energy to become volatile, threatening to explode our bodies at any moment, we would have already become great cultivators, ruling the cultivation world.  Why would we need to be so cautious?”</p><p>The Dongji and Beichen leaders felt the same. They had fallen deeply into the demonic path, with no way back.</p><p>“You felt it?”</p><p>The demon lord laughed ominously.</p><p>“It wasn’t me tampering with you.  You are of the human race, yet you cultivate the sacred clan’s supreme technique. Reaching a certain level, without my guidance to adjust it, this is inevitable. When I reversed the seal to the outer hall, I was already at my wit's end, too late to help you adjust. However, without cultivating the sacred clan’s technique, even with your talents, breaking through to Yuan Ying would have been your limit. Aren’t you satisfied with your current cultivation and achievements?”</p><p>The three leaders felt a little ashamed. The demon lord wasn't wrong. Without that chance encounter in the outer hall, they would have remained unremarkable.</p><p>“Besides, without this hidden danger, would you have come to see me?”</p><p>The demon lord’s tone was flat, yet it made the three’s hearts pound.</p><p>“We made a vow with our demonic minds. How dare we disobey?”</p><p>Xi You’s leader’s face was clouded.</p><p>The demon lord didn't care, saying indifferently, “Rest assured. Trapped here, bored for countless years, I’ve already refined the technique long ago, and can easily solve the hidden danger within you. Even if you cultivate to the Void Refinement stage and beyond, there will be no repercussions.”</p><p>The demon lord’s words were boastful. Void Refinement was something they dared not even dream of, let alone beyond that.</p><p>“Is she the vessel you prepared for me?”</p><p>The grotesque face twisted.</p><p>The empty eye sockets turned towards Su Nu.</p><p>The Dongji leader brought Su Nu before the stele.</p><p>Su Nu trembled.</p><p>After studying Su Nu for a moment, the Demon Lord's voice suddenly turned icy, "Have you completely forgotten my orders?"</p><p>The three men's hearts skipped a beat. The East Pole Alliance Leader forced himself to remain calm, explaining repeatedly, "Your Majesty, please calm your anger.  The Nine Transformations Yin Body and other spiritual bodies you requested are extremely rare, even rarer than those with Heavenly Spiritual Roots.  They are almost impossible to find. The three of us have mobilized the power of the Merchant Alliance to search relentlessly, and we've only found a few disciples with Yin meridians. We discovered this woman decades ago.  She was only at the Foundation Establishment stage then. We spared no effort to help her cultivate, and she reached the late Core Formation stage, unfortunately failing at the Nascent Soul stage. However, she possesses the Five Yin Mystical Body, second only to the Nine Transformations Yin Body. Even if her cultivation is slightly lower, she is far superior to those with Yin meridians."</p><p>After a moment of silence, the Demon Lord coldly said, "Very well! This vessel will suffice.  Have you completed the other tasks?"</p><p>The three alliance leaders secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The old demon was angry because of Su Nu's insufficient cultivation; he hadn't discovered their hidden plan.</p><p>The North Star Alliance Leader replied, "Your Majesty, we have embedded Demon煞 True Spirit Talismans into the auxiliary altars in the outer hall.  The three main altars have also been tampered with, as per your orders. Once activated, they will immediately suppress the power of the thunder chains on the altar, shaking the entire sealing array and helping Your Majesty break the seal..."</p><p>The North Star Alliance Leader gave a brief summary of the process.</p><p>The other two also briefly described what they had done.</p><p>"Well done,"</p><p>The Demon Lord was pleased, a strange smile appearing on his grotesque face. "What are you waiting for? Quickly help me break the seal!"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>The three looked at each other.</p><p>The North Star Alliance Leader cautiously said, "Your Majesty, the hidden dangers in our cultivation techniques..."</p><p>"Help me break the seal, and I will give you the methods to improve them. In the future, you will be my generals, conquering the cultivation world with me.  What benefit would it be to me if you die from exploding bodies?"</p><p>The Demon Lord snorted, "Should I make a heart demon oath?"</p><p>The three Alliance Leaders were tempted, but remained silent.</p><p>The Demon Lord didn't get angry, and readily made an oath.</p><p>The three's expressions eased slightly. They placed Su Nu before the stele, then surrounded it, positioned at three different sides, their fingers spinning, rapidly forming hand seals.</p>
