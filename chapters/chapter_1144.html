<h1>Chapter 1136: The Spirit of the Willow Tree</h1><p>Upon entering the Thousand Bamboo Sea, the white cat visibly relaxed, leaping and darting through the bamboo groves. It was clear that the cat was intimately familiar with the area, skillfully guiding Qin Sang to avoid other demon beasts. As they approached the heart of the Thousand Bamboo Sea, the white cat led Qin Sang to a cave and said, "Young Master Qin, we left the city in haste, and Elder Willow is unaware of our return. Please wait here for a moment while I go back and consult with Elder Willow on how to proceed."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement, understanding the necessity of the cat's caution given the gravity of the situation.</p><p>The white cat gave Qin Sang a nod before turning and leaping out of the cave, disappearing into the vast expanse of bamboo.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed his presence, standing at the cave's entrance, his expression thoughtful. Infiltrating the demon realm and making contact with the demon beasts of the Thousand Bamboo Sea was only the first step. To gain their assistance in investigating the Demon King Qianji and the mysterious stone slab, he would need to earn their trust.</p><p>He gazed into the distance. Since entering the bamboo sea, he had sensed traces of demon beasts, including spirits of plants and trees. The demon beasts of the Thousand Bamboo Sea were known for their gentle nature, and so far, he had not encountered any conflicts.</p><p>As the sun set, the sky was painted with hues of red. Night fell, and still, there was no sign of the white cat's return. Qin Sang understood that the news of Yunyouzi's demise, which the white cat had brought back, would undoubtedly catch Elder Willow off guard. The old willow tree would need time to decide how to approach him, so Qin Sang was in no hurry.</p><p>He entered the cave, sat cross-legged, fed his Heavenly Eye Butterfly, and then quietly refined his sword formation. Unnoticed, the night deepened, and the hour of midnight arrived. The sky was overcast, with no stars or moon in sight, plunging everything into pitch-black darkness.</p><p>After sitting in silence for half the night, Qin Sang's eyelids suddenly twitched, and he slowly opened his eyes. A faint whistling sound came from outside the cave, and a white figure flashed into the cavern.</p><p>The white cat had returned. Seeing Qin Sang still patiently waiting in the cave, it breathed a sigh of relief and said apologetically, "Young Master Qin, I apologize for the long wait."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded indifferently, glancing outside the cave to ensure no other demon beasts were present.</p><p>"Elder Willow has instructed me to bring you to him. He is currently in his cave, manipulating the spirit formation and discreetly diverting the guards so we can avoid prying eyes and prevent your identity from being exposed," the white cat explained.</p><p>They set off under the cover of night, traversing several mountain ranges without alerting any demon beasts, eventually arriving at Elder Willow's cave.</p><p>In the deep of night, it was difficult to appreciate the beauty of the surroundings. Qin Sang remained cautious, silently observing his surroundings. He noticed that the white cat led him through a mountain valley, and as they emerged, they entered a basin.</p><p>The basin was shrouded in a misty haze, and within it stood a series of wooden palaces, arranged in an orderly fashion.</p><p>As they entered the basin, the white cat led Qin Sang toward one of the palaces. However, Qin Sang suddenly stopped and turned his gaze to a row of willow trees beside the palace. His eyes quickly scanned the trees before settling on one particularly ancient willow.</p><p>"Young Master Qin's perception is indeed extraordinary, to see through this old one's true form at a glance," a voice said.</p><p>In the next moment, a green light shimmered on the willow tree, coalescing into a slightly ethereal figure that slowly descended.</p><p>The spirit of the willow tree had taken the form of an elderly man, leaning on a cane. His eyes sparkled with an unusual light as he examined Qin Sang, offering a compliment before clasping his hands in greeting. "This old one failed to welcome you from afar. Please forgive the oversight, Young Master Qin."</p><p>"Elder Willow!" The white cat bowed respectfully.</p><p>"Elder Willow's concealment skills are truly remarkable. It was only by chance that I sensed a trace of your presence," Qin Sang said modestly.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, his Heavenly Eye Butterfly had advanced to the late third transformation. Even a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, unless skilled in concealment techniques, would find it difficult to evade the butterfly's divine sight, let alone a mere tree spirit.</p><p>"Young Master Qin need not be modest. Our king entrusted the Thousand Bamboo Sea to you for a reason. This old one trusts the king's judgment," the willow spirit said, expressing goodwill. Seeing the sincerity in his demeanor, Qin Sang felt somewhat reassured.</p><p>They entered the main hall.</p><p>The willow spirit invited Qin Sang to sit and ordered the white cat to serve tea, displaying manners no less refined than those of humans. Qin Sang had initially worried that the demon beasts might be unruly, but now it seemed his concerns were unfounded.</p><p>"The situation in the Thousand Bamboo Sea has likely been explained to you by Little White. Since our king's disappearance, the Thousand Bamboo Sea has been in turmoil, attracting the covetous eyes of outsiders. We had just begun to stabilize with the king's return when the upheaval in the cultivation world struck, and now we have received the tragic news of his demise..." The willow spirit's voice was heavy, his eyes filled with deep sorrow and confusion.</p><p>Moved by his emotions, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness.</p><p>The willow spirit composed himself and said, "With the king's passing, this old one, with my limited cultivation, am powerless to protect the Thousand Bamboo Sea. But I cannot allow the spirits of the bamboo sea to be trampled upon, nor can I let the foundation our king left behind be destroyed. Little White mentioned that Young Master Qin possesses a disguise technique..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, not withholding anything, and simultaneously activated his Heavenly Demon Transformation and disguise technique.</p><p>"Indeed, an aura comparable to that of a transformed great demon! Young Master Qin could pose as the king's successor..." The willow spirit was overjoyed.</p><p>However, as if remembering something, his joy faded, and a hint of worry appeared in his eyes. He tentatively asked, "How long does Young Master Qin plan to stay in the Thousand Bamboo Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang understood his concern and, after a moment of thought, replied, "At present, my most important task is to refine my cultivation and prepare for the Nascent Soul breakthrough. I have no sect and am alone in the world. Before my breakthrough, it matters little where I cultivate. However..."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone suddenly shifted, causing the willow spirit's smile to freeze.</p><p>"I have another request to make. This matter is crucial to my Nascent Soul breakthrough. If I can reach the Nascent Soul stage, protecting the Thousand Bamboo Sea will be a trivial matter."</p><p>Seeing the willow spirit's expression, Qin Sang guessed that he might think he was using this as leverage and quickly added, "Elder Willow, please do not misunderstand. Senior Yunyouzi was both a mentor and a friend to me. Regardless of the outcome, I will spare no effort in fulfilling his entrusted task."</p><p>The willow spirit's expression softened slightly, and he hesitated before asking, "If it concerns the Nascent Soul breakthrough, it must be of great importance. What can we do to assist Young Master Qin?"</p><p>"I would like to ask Elder Willow to help me gather information..." Qin Sang leaned forward slightly, explaining his intentions.</p><p>"Demon King Qianji! The mysterious stone slab!" The willow spirit stood up and began pacing, frowning in deep thought.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing that he did not outright refuse, felt a flicker of hope.</p><p>After a moment, the willow spirit said gravely, "We plant spirits, though not as adept in combat as other demon beasts, possess unique survival skills. However, with our limited cultivation, we cannot easily approach the Demon King's lair to steal the stone slab. Given how highly Demon King Qianji values that slab, it may be difficult to uncover useful information."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was delighted. "Thank you, Elder Willow! Simply understanding Demon King Qianji's background and the location of his lair would suffice. If it comes to confronting the Demon King directly, I have my own methods and will not trouble you further."</p><p>The willow spirit's eyes showed surprise, and he finally made a promise. "If the stone slab can truly aid Young Master Qin in achieving the Nascent Soul stage, it would be a tremendous boon for the spirits of the Thousand Bamboo Sea. This old one will spare no effort in assisting you."</p>
