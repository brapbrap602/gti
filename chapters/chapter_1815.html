Chapter 1806: Discourse on the Sword Dao


As for the specific time, Qin Sang couldn't say for sure.
The Wheel Seal and the Demon-Subduing Seal had already merged, taking little time, seemingly without difficulty.
The further he progressed, the more difficult the fusion would undoubtedly become, and Qin Sang couldn't neglect his own cultivation to focus solely on comprehending the Buddhist Seals.
"How about a limit of fifty years?" Qin Sang mused, proposing a generous timeframe.
To a Nascent Soul cultivator, fifty years was but a snap of the fingers.
"Fifty years…"
Venerable Zhenru fell silent for a moment, then nodded.
As long as the seal could be broken within a hundred years and the Buddhist treasures within the pagoda retrieved, it was acceptable.
His next Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation was still a hundred and fifty years away, leaving ample time to digest his gains.
"This poor monk will await Fellow Daoist for fifty years! If Fellow Daoist is unable to break the seal after fifty years, I hope you will pass this seal on to our temple."
Venerable Zhenru added another condition. He would offer suitable treasures in exchange, but the Buddhist treasures within the Futu Pagoda would no longer concern Qin Sang.
Qin Sang pondered and agreed.
He remained at Mirror Stage Temple for several months, studying Buddhist Dharma and repeatedly observing the recorded image.
It was the insights gained from this recording that gave Qin Sang the confidence to merge the Buddhist Seals.
On the day of his departure, Venerable Zhenru personally escorted Qin Sang down the mountain.
"Please, Venerable One, you may stop here."
Qin Sang bowed, then summoned his escaping light and flew north.
Venerable Zhenru watched Qin Sang depart, then returned to the temple and began his preparations. The two agreed to gather as many treasures as possible to help resist the golden light. If any other methods of breaking the restriction were found, Qin Sang would immediately return to assist.
During his return journey, Qin Sang immersed most of his mind in the *Seven Masters' Buddhist Seals*. The image of the monk was deeply impactful, broadening Qin Sang's horizons and, most importantly, showing him the way forward.
Returning to Star Island's Immortal Lake, Qin Sang first went to the island within his gourd. He traversed the city streets for a while, arriving before a secluded courtyard in the mortal residential area, and knocked on the gate ring.
With a creak, an old man opened the door. Seeing Qin Sang, his face lit up with joy. "Master, you've returned."
"Old Chen, your health seems even more robust," Qin Sang smiled as he entered the courtyard.
The old man's face was filled with gratitude. "Thanks to Master curing my illness and providing me with a place to live, even if I were to serve you as an ox or a horse for life after life, it wouldn't be enough to repay your kindness."
Qin Sang shook his head. "Consider looking after this courtyard as payment for the treatment. There's no need to be an ox or a horse."
Dismissing the old man, Qin Sang entered the quiet room in the back hall.
A formation was set up within the quiet room. If Mo Xingdao had any news, he would transmit it through this formation. This was the only way the two could communicate; it wasn't immediate, but it offered secrecy.
Qin Sang activated the formation, but there was no response.
After comforting the old man with a few words and leaving some silver, he stepped out of the courtyard and headed to Master Qi's residence.
Since helping Qin Sang refine the Returning Wind Armor, Master Qi's refining skills had greatly improved, and his reputation had become even more prominent.
Master Qi hadn't given up on further smelting the True Treasure fragments, but each attempt required a vast amount of resources and carried the risk of destroying the Returning Wind Armor.
It wasn't that Qin Sang was unwilling to part with the Returning Wind Armor; he simply had more important matters to attend to. He took out most of his resources and entrusted Master Qi to gather as many spirit flowers needed for the Radiant Flower Pill as possible, to be given to Master Lingxu for pill refinement.
There was another purpose to this visit to Master Qi: the channeling of spiritual veins in the gauntlets was more than halfway complete, and he wanted Master Qi to take a look.
As soon as Qin Sang met Master Qi, the Returning Wind Armor was immediately requested. Qin Sang smiled wryly and followed Master Qi into the fire chamber.
Ten days later, Qin Sang left Master Qi's residence and, through the Dao Court's channels, sent the spirit flowers to Master Lingxu's residence.
If it were a supreme treasure, he certainly wouldn't entrust it to others, but the Dao Court likely wouldn't covet these spirit flowers.
Having dealt with these trivial matters, Qin Sang returned to Sword Heart Island to continue his secluded cultivation.
Time flew by.
Another half a year passed in a blink.
One day, Qin Sang held the Chengying Sword in his hands, a contemplative look on his face.
After a moment, he made up his mind, put away the sword, and left his cave, deciding to ask True Person Zhijian to examine it.
For nearly three years, Qin Sang had continuously tried various methods, but the sword remained unresponsive.
Even with Qin Sang's continuous breakthroughs in the Dao of Refining, he wouldn't surpass the Bright Summit Sect Master by much and couldn't discern the sword's secrets. He could only consult an expert in the Sword Dao.
Furthermore, he didn't intend to waste any more time on the Chengying Sword.
He had many things to do, and cultivation was paramount.
Because his divine sense was limited, and he didn't know when he could refine the Qilin Source Seed, Qin Sang had to continuously improve his physical cultivation if he wanted to maintain his combat prowess, cultivating both body and Dharma.
With the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* as his primary focus and the *Celestial Demon Body Refining Art* as a supplement, he needed double the cultivation time.
Secondly, comprehending the *Seven Masters' Buddhist Seals*, refining the gauntlets, and blood-feeding the Heaven's Eye Butterfly all required his attention.
The Sword Slave diligently guarded True Person Zhijian's cave entrance, evidently having received instructions. Upon learning Qin Sang's intentions, he immediately activated the formation restriction.
"Come in and speak, Brother."
True Person Zhijian's voice came from within the cave, and the gate opened on its own.
The Sword Slave respectfully retreated to the side.
This was Qin Sang's first time entering True Person Zhijian's cave, and he curiously looked around.
While the cave True Person Zhijian had arranged for him was meticulously furnished, his own cave was practically spartan.
Within the hall, there was only one person, one meditation mat, and one incense table.
On the incense table was an incense burner and… a sword being offered reverence!
Qin Sang couldn't help but take a closer look. The sword was quite peculiar, hanging upside down above the incense table.
He had only seen ancestors or statues being venerated in the lecture hall, and this was the first time he'd seen someone venerate a sword.
The sword was unsheathed, wrapped entirely in white cloth, including the hilt, making it impossible to see its true form.
Qin Sang could tell that this was no ordinary white cloth. It was inscribed with runes, though their purpose was unknown.
He had never seen True Person Zhijian use this sword before.
Doubt filled Qin Sang's heart. He looked towards True Person Zhijian, who had his back to him, and his expression suddenly changed. "Brother, you…"
His face flushed with shame. "I shouldn't have come."
True Person Zhijian's aura at this moment was extremely powerful, yet with subtle fluctuations. Such a manifestation only occurred when one was on the verge of a breakthrough.
In just a few years, True Person Zhijian was about to break through to mid-Nascent Soul.
He had indeed come at an inopportune time.
"It's fine," True Person Zhijian slowly withdrew his cultivation, speaking calmly. "This breakthrough was actually quite forced. I was almost overwhelmed, and your arrival, Brother, has helped me regain my composure."
Unsure whether True Person Zhijian's words were true or false, Qin Sang felt genuinely guilty and hesitated, unwilling to disturb him further.
True Person Zhijian rose and turned around. "Every word I spoke is true. There's no need for you to feel burdened, Brother. If you have something important to discuss, please speak frankly."
With a sigh, Qin Sang nodded and directly took out the Chengying Sword. "I obtained this sword by chance and don't know its origins. I originally intended to ask for your guidance, Brother, but unexpectedly…"
As he spoke, Qin Sang handed the Chengying Sword over.
True Person Zhijian took it, gazed at it for a moment, then let out a soft exclamation. He then ran a finger along the blade.
*Clang!* A crisp sword cry resonated throughout the cave.
Qin Sang's gaze fixed. The Chengying Sword had never produced such a clear sword cry in his hands.
True Person Zhijian flipped the sword and lightly swung it twice, clicking his tongue in admiration. A look of delight filled his eyes as he exclaimed, "There truly are such swords in the world."
Gently stroking the blade, True Person Zhijian continued, sharing his insights with Qin Sang. "I recall, Brother, that you also used a sword in the Wicked Lands, your swordsmanship quite impressive. You should understand the Sword Dao."
Qin Sang remained silent, glancing at the Chengying Sword in True Person Zhijian's hand. He truly didn't dare claim to understand the Sword Dao.
Unaware of Qin Sang's thoughts, True Person Zhijian didn't wait for a response and didn't mind. His eyes gleaming as he gazed at the Chengying Sword, he murmured:
"What is the Sword Dao?
"We cultivate the purest Sword Intent, nurturing our swords with it. Whether we choose the Sword of Slaughter, the Sword of Illusion, the Sword of Transformation, the Sword of Extremes, or any other path, our hearts hold only the sword, our Sword Hearts clear and bright, utterly refined and pure.
"Some believe that only those whose hearts are utterly devoted to the sword are true sword cultivators, considering this the orthodox path, all others inferior."
Qin Sang nodded. He agreed with this viewpoint.
He could recognize his own limitations and knew he couldn't be a true sword cultivator.
The *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* was undoubtedly a top-tier cultivation method of the Sword of Slaughter lineage, yet he always treated it as a tool, prioritizing the Killing Talismans that enhanced his cultivation speed.
Looking back on his cultivation journey, he had dabbled in too many areas: ghosts, corpses, demons, insects, fire, poison, avatars, Buddhist, Daoist, and Demonic arts, and more.
He had never even broken through a major realm purely through the Sword Dao.
As long as it could help him, enhance his strength, and aid his breakthroughs, he would utilize it without hesitation.
Among his acquaintances, Senior Qingzhu could be considered a sword cultivator. Shangguan Lifeng, having abandoned the saber for the sword, might count as half a sword cultivator if he could comprehend the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture*.
The True Person Zhijian before him, Qin Sang believed, also qualified.
Unexpectedly, True Person Zhijian gently shook his head.
"This Sword Dao lies in purity, but does that mean others who practice the sword are not sword cultivators?
"Perhaps due to insufficient talent, inadequate temperament, or various external factors, they cannot walk the path of pure Sword Intent.
"There exists the Dao of Talisman Swords, the Dao of Ten Thousand Swords, those who focus on sword formations, those who prioritize techniques over the Dao, and those obsessed with finding rare treasures and refining the strongest sword without demanding Sword Intent.
"Or perhaps they cultivate Sword Intent but rely on external forces.
"Are their alternative paths, their unique pursuits of the Sword Dao, truly inferior to the path of pure Sword Intent?
"This poor Daoist believes that all Daos lead to the same destination, differing only in their approach, not in their superiority or inferiority.
"However, what people remember are those with towering Sword Intent, those who, despite countless hardships and dangers, can cleave through them all with a single strike, displaying unparalleled elegance.
"It's just that we have yet to see someone take those other paths to their ultimate extremes."
True Person Zhijian seemed to be merely expressing his feelings, sharing his understanding of the Sword Dao, not expecting a response from Qin Sang. He gestured towards the Chengying Sword. "This sword is an 'external object' that can grant Sword Intent."
Qin Sang was still pondering True Person Zhijian's discourse when he heard these words and couldn't help but examine the Chengying Sword closely.
"Legend speaks of a Sword Dao method that must be performed by a top-tier sword cultivator. During the tempering process, they infuse their own Sword Intent, ultimately forming a special sword," True Person Zhijian continued.
"How is this sword used?" Qin Sang asked, puzzled. He hadn't sensed any Sword Intent within the Chengying Sword.
"This type of sword cannot be used independently, but it can be refined. During the refining process, it utilizes your own spirit sword. After refinement, not only will it enhance the power of your spirit sword, but it will also split off a sword shadow. It is said that the sword shadow can possess a significant portion of the spirit sword's power, and because it's formless, it can be used unexpectedly, catching enemies off guard. They certainly won't anticipate a hidden sword shadow."
True Person Zhijian paused, then added, "Most importantly, one can obtain the Sword Intent left behind by predecessors from this sword. By first obtaining and then comprehending, it's naturally much easier than cultivating it oneself. However, such inheritance is completely different from being taught sword scriptures. It will inevitably imprint that Sword Intent upon your heart, making it difficult to erase. It's most suitable for passing down teachings to younger members of the same sect, hence it's also known as an Inheritance Sword. If this poor Daoist wasn't pursuing pure Sword Intent and didn't want to be interfered with, I would definitely ask you for this sword, Brother."
He repeatedly expressed his regret.
Such swords were indeed extremely valuable and incredibly rare. Those who could refine Inheritance Swords were all top-tier sword cultivators.
Upon hearing this, Qin Sang also furrowed his brow in thought.
Judging by True Person Zhijian's wording, the Chengying Sword seemed to involve more than simply merging with a spirit sword. He wondered if it could be used with the Cloud Wanderer Sword. If not, he could only choose the Grey Warbler Sword.
As for the Sword Intent inheritance, Qin Sang was naturally very tempted, but the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* was his fundamental cultivation method. Would rashly accepting another's Sword Intent inheritance destabilize his own Dao path?
With an expert right in front of him, Qin Sang immediately voiced his concerns.
Learning that Qin Sang's fundamental cultivation method was a Sword Dao method, True Person Zhijian's expression became somewhat peculiar. After all, Qin Sang had previously demonstrated remarkable prowess in both physical cultivation and the Dao of Poison.
Other sword cultivators who didn't cultivate Sword Intent at least still used swords.
True Person Zhijian carefully considered his words. "Brother, you are different from us. If you don't pursue utterly pure Sword Intent, you can accept the inheritance and will undoubtedly benefit greatly, but it's best not to accept it completely. How to grasp the 'degree' within it requires your own judgment, Brother. However, doing so would inevitably be a waste of a precious treasure."
As he spoke, True Person Zhijian's face showed a hint of regret. An Inheritance Sword could only be passed on to one person. If Qin Sang accepted a portion, the remaining Sword Intent would dissipate.
If a descendant of the person who refined the Chengying Sword were to obtain it, it might give rise to another top-tier sword cultivator.
Qin Sang didn't harbor such thoughts. The Chengying Sword came from the Immortal Palace. The person who refined the sword had likely long since turned to dust, their descendants nowhere to be found.
Thinking of this, a sudden thought struck Qin Sang.
Both the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* and the Chengying Sword originated from the Immortal Palace. Could there be a connection between the two inheritances?
With this thought in mind, Qin Sang was even more determined to try.
"Are you certain you want to accept the Sword Intent inheritance, Brother?" True Person Zhijian asked.
Qin Sang nodded without hesitation. "Please teach me, Brother."
"Inheritance Swords typically have a special seal that locks the Sword Intent inheritance, preventing it from being recognized by others. You must first find the seal and then assess its strength…"
True Person Zhijian meticulously explained the method of refining an Inheritance Sword to Qin Sang.
Qin Sang carefully memorized it, thinking to himself that the Chengying Sword had existed for an unknown number of years, and its seal, eroded by time, might have weakened considerably.
Having received True Person Zhijian's guidance, Qin Sang bowed in gratitude. He didn't leave immediately, but instead gestured towards the cave entrance. "I will protect you while you cultivate, Brother."
True Person Zhijian was on the verge of a breakthrough and couldn't be disturbed again.
True Person Zhijian didn't refuse, nodding with a smile. "If you have any questions regarding the Sword Dao in the future, feel free to come find me.  Though this brother is untalented, I may still offer you some insights. My help is not given freely, Brother. After you comprehend the inheritance, this brother wants to spar with you."
"More than just insights. I only hope you won't find me bothersome in the future, Brother," Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Befriending True Person Zhijian had indeed been a brilliant move.
Since Senior Qingzhu, he had finally encountered another renowned master of the Sword Dao.
True Person Zhijian laughed heartily.
