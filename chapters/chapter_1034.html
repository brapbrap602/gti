<h1>Chapter 1026: A Deal</h1><p>After waiting for a while, the young woman couldn't contain herself any longer and quietly crept towards that direction.</p><p>She was very careful, not approaching rashly, but constantly calculating the illusionary array.</p><p>Finally, she was surprised to discover that there was indeed a way out.</p><p>The young woman wasn't sure if the other person had noticed her.</p><p>She had two choices: leave through this path or calculate another path herself, as there was more than one way out of the illusionary array.</p><p>Following him might lead to an ambush.</p><p>Just then, a voice suddenly came from the nearby woods.</p><p>“We should each go our own way in this illusionary array, fellow cultivator, yet you are following me.  What are your intentions?”</p><p>The young woman was startled, but surprisingly, she didn't retreat immediately. Looking in the direction of the voice, she calmly said, “Fellow cultivator, please don't misunderstand. I have been trapped here for too long and was anxious. Seeing you find a way out, I wanted to rely on your strength to escape. I didn't expect you to not leave.”</p><p>After a moment of silence, another voice came from that direction.</p><p>“With a Life Charm in hand, are you still afraid of this mere illusionary array?”</p><p>From behind an ancient tree, Qin Sang watched the young woman coldly.</p><p>He knew that the noise he made along the way would inevitably attract attention.  He didn't want a tail following him, so he pretended to leave and waited for her to show herself.</p><p>If she dared to follow, then she wouldn't be leaving.</p><p>But he was surprised by the young woman's identity.</p><p>Before the trial began, Old Man Mu exchanged his qualification for a Life Charm, which he gave to this young woman.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the function of the Life Charm, so he didn't act rashly.</p><p>Something obtained by a Yuan Ying master must be extraordinary, possibly even surpassing the power of a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>His caution proved correct.</p><p>Although the young woman's cultivation was at the late Golden Core stage, judging from her aura, her strength wasn't top-tier. Yet, she faced the potential ambush with composure, appearing fearless.</p><p>Either it was a life-saving treasure given by a Yuan Ying master, or the Life Charm gave her the confidence.</p><p>There was more than one Soul Cleansing Liquid in the trial realm.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to clash with someone like this; it would be best to scare her away.</p><p>But the young woman showed no intention of leaving.  She had raised her sleeves defensively, but she put them down, saying, “Fellow cultivator, you don’t know, the Life Charm can indeed protect my life, but it doesn't work very well in this Thousand Mountain Array.  My biggest concern is how to quickly escape the Thousand Mountain Array, lest someone gets the treasure first and my master's efforts are wasted.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly and said coldly, “Whether you get the treasure or your master's efforts are in vain has nothing to do with me. Why are you secretly following me? You’re my competitor. Are you asking for my help?”</p><p>Hearing this, the young woman’s lips curled slightly.  Suddenly changing the subject, she asked, “My name is Ming Wei.  May I ask for your name, fellow cultivator?”</p><p>“My surname is Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, “This is a warning. Don't do it again. I hope you won't make a mistake!”</p><p>Having said that, he started to leave.</p><p>Ming Wei's expression changed, and she hurriedly said, “Fellow Cultivator Qin, wait! I have a proposal. I want to make a deal with you. Please hear me out before you make a decision.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred. He paused and said, “What deal? Are you planning to hand over the treasure to me?”</p><p>“Handing it over is absolutely impossible!”</p><p>Ming Wei shook her head. “But we can cooperate. You arrived here so quickly, which shows that you're exceptionally strong and are surely after the Soul Cleansing Liquid, right? There isn't just one Soul Cleansing Liquid. Why can’t we cooperate to obtain it? Disciples from major sects come in groups. We're alone, which puts us at a significant disadvantage.”</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed, “There may be more than one Soul Cleansing Liquid, but it certainly won’t be many. You can't even get past the Thousand Mountain Array. I only need to move forward to leave you far behind. Why take you along and give myself another competitor?”</p><p>Ming Wei was secretly annoyed and gritted her teeth. “I’m not incapable of passing it! It's just that calculating the changes in the illusionary array consumes too much energy and time! If it weren’t for your mastery of illusionary arrays, do you think I’d need your help? If it weren’t for this strange Thousand Illusion Array, I would have left you behind long ago!”</p><p>“Why cling to these hypothetical scenarios? There are no ifs in this world.  Cooperation isn't impossible, but what can you offer me?” Qin Sang stroked his chin.</p><p>“The Life Charm isn't just for me. It can also protect you! As long as the Life Charm is activated within the trial realm, no danger can harm us. Is that enough?”</p><p>Ming Wei lifted her chin confidently.</p><p>“Any danger?”</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.  No wonder Old Man Mu was willing to pay such a high price for the Life Charm—he was paving the way for his successors.</p><p>In all likelihood, a Life Charm was roughly equivalent to a Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>Excellent! We swear on our deepest desires. You'll guide me through this trial, and we'll cooperate to obtain the Soul Cleansing Liquid in the final test.  In times of danger, I'll activate the Life Charm to protect us both. You know how perilous the final trial is. But I have a condition…”</p><p>Ming Wei’s tone hardened.  She paused, then continued, “If there's more than one Soul Cleansing Liquid, there's no need for us to fight. But if only one remains, you must give it to me!”</p><p>Ming Wei's tone brooked no argument.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate, flatly refusing, “No!”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“Without you, I'm confident I can still obtain a Soul Cleansing Liquid. I'd really like to see what those disciples from the major sects are capable of,” Qin Sang sneered, “I only agreed to cooperate with you as a precaution.  Giving up the Soul Cleansing Liquid is absolutely out of the question. However, we can agree beforehand: if it comes to that, our agreement is void, and whoever gets the Soul Cleansing Liquid will depend entirely on their own abilities.  Does that work for you?”</p><p>Qin Sang agreed to work with Ming Wei because he considered her a highly valued disciple of Old Man Mu, someone who surely knew the trials better than most. He himself knew too little about them; he'd be at a disadvantage against the sect disciples.  Ming Wei's assistance would help him avoid many pitfalls.</p><p>Qin Sang’s confidence stemmed from his own strength.</p><p>Even with Ming Wei’s Life Charm, it wouldn't be much use during the actual struggle for the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Ming Wei nodded. “Fine, I accept your terms. Let's swear on our deepest desires now. After leaving the Thousand Mountain Formation, we'll meet at the agreed location before the final trial.”</p><p>“Agreed!”</p><p>Following this, they discussed the details and made their oaths.</p><p>Ming Wei relaxed, looking towards the deep fog, “Friend, you may reveal yourself. We must hurry.”</p><p>The mist swirled.</p><p>Qin Sang, masked, appeared.</p><p>They exchanged glances before departing together.</p>
