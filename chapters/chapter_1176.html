<h1>Chapter 1168: Tracking</h1><p>After their discussions, the Serpent King spoke in a deep voice, "One thing is certain: the rate of mutation is accelerating. It’s possible that within a hundred years, we’ll see the outcome. Barring any unforeseen events, all of us here will live to witness that day. This could very well be the greatest opportunity for our generation of cultivators! This is an unprecedented upheaval, and we must prepare early. At the very least, we demons must stand united if we are to seize more treasures!"</p><p>The Red-Tailed Demon King rubbed his hands together excitedly and said, "Let’s follow the Serpent King’s advice! There’s no deep-seated hatred between us. If there are any conflicts, let’s set them aside for now. Let the humans fight among themselves—the more chaotic, the better. It’d be best if they were completely divided and never able to unite!"</p><p>The other demon kings exchanged glances, but none voiced any objections.</p><p>The Feather Demon King looked around and said, "No one can predict how the Purple Palace will evolve in the future. However, the next time we enter the Purple Palace, we’ll still need to rely on the human’s grand formation. The reason I’ve gathered everyone here today is to discuss our next expedition to the Purple Palace."</p><p>While the demon kings debated, Qin Sang remained mostly silent, quietly absorbing the secrets about the Purple Palace they revealed.</p><p>The Red-Tailed Demon King noticed Qin Sang’s lack of enthusiasm and sent a voice transmission, "Fellow Daoist Mingyue, you don’t seem very interested. Are you not planning to go to the Purple Palace?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "I’ve heard that the Purple Palace has been ransacked time and time again. Since I know nothing about it, I doubt I’ll find any treasures there. Honestly, I’m not very interested. I’ll consult my master before making a decision. I’ve only recently formed my Nascent Soul, so my priority is to stabilize my cultivation and refine my divine abilities."</p><p>Before long, the demon kings had agreed on a rough plan, leaving room for flexibility as circumstances dictated.</p><p>Then, finally, one of the demon kings brought up the topic Qin Sang was most concerned about: the war.</p><p>"The Sin God Palace and the Purple Palace are connected. Since we’ve detected anomalies in the Purple Palace’s immortal formation, the Sin Abyss must have noticed as well. Will they call a temporary truce, like last time, to recover their strength and resume fighting after the Purple Palace expedition?"</p><p>The Feather Demon King nodded. "That’s precisely the second matter we need to discuss. Not long ago, the humans sent us a message. They share similar suspicions, but they’re more on guard."</p><p>"Oh? What do you mean by that?" the demon kings asked, intrigued.</p><p>"Actually, I’m sure all of you have noticed from the scattered news you’ve received that the Sin Abyss’s offensive this time seems rather strange. Since the war began, the Sin Abyss has been aggressive, putting on a show of launching a massive attack, but their momentum is far weaker than last time. The Heavenly Alliance lost a few cities but quickly stabilized their position, and the war has dragged on for years in this stalemate."</p><p>The Feather Demon King tapped the armrest of his chair lightly. "Elder Zhenyi is worried that the Sin Abyss is trying to lull the Two Realms Alliance into complacency. If the alliance lets its guard down, they might be caught off guard when something happens, especially with the Purple Palace’s imminent emergence. However, I suspect the Two Realms Alliance might not be content to just endure the attacks. They might have other plans. This prolonged war is also a heavy burden for the Sin Abyss. Is their foundation truly unfathomable, or are they just putting on a show?"</p><p>"So, Elder Zhenyi wants to take the initiative and strike first?" one of the demon kings asked with a cold smile. "If it weren’t for our ancestors’ pact, I wouldn’t lend them a single soldier! They’ve already borrowed so many of our demon troops, and now they’re coming to us again. Do they expect us to personally join the fight?"</p><p>The Feather Demon King flicked his finger, sending out a streak of light. "These are the conditions the humans have proposed. Take a look, fellow Daoists. If you go to the front lines, you’ll only need to operate the city’s defensive formation and command the demon troops. If the situation turns dire, you can retreat in time. If there are other arrangements later, you can negotiate directly with the humans and decide whether to participate…"</p><p>After a pause, the Feather Demon King added, "I won’t hide anything from you all. I hope the Two Realms Alliance can hold off the Sin Abyss. I don’t know if it’s just my imagination, but in recent years, the few Sin Abyss Nascent Soul cultivators I’ve encountered, especially the old devil Ye, have given me an increasingly uncomfortable feeling. This eerie, sinister aura is something even the accomplished demonic cultivator Tongyou never exuded."</p><p>The Serpent King spoke up, "I share similar thoughts. If the Sin Abyss devours the Frost Domain, it’s unlikely they’ll continue to honor our ancestors’ pact. After this meeting, I’ll personally make a trip."</p><p>The streak of light circled the hall, and after everyone had a chance to review it, the voices of opposition grew much quieter.</p><p>The rewards offered by the humans were indeed generous, and the main requirement was simply to participate in defending the city, which significantly reduced the danger. Even if they were defeated, as shape-shifting demons, escaping in advance shouldn’t be too difficult.</p><p>For a moment, the hall fell silent as the demon kings weighed the pros and cons.</p><p>In the end, some agreed to participate, while others refused.</p><p>Qin Sang was among those who agreed to join the fight.</p><p>He had originally intended to visit the front lines anyway.</p><p>As a human, with many friends and family in the Frost Domain, he felt obligated to contribute. With his escape techniques, he could likely survive even in dangerous situations.</p><p>If they were truly outmatched, then there was nothing to be done but flee like a stray dog to another land.</p><p>By disguising himself as a demon king and participating in the city’s defense, he could also earn rewards.</p><p>What Qin Sang had his eye on was a rare spiritual wood called Golden Sinking Wood.</p><p>His Ebony Sword didn’t need to devour other spiritual woods at the moment.</p><p>He wanted to prepare a second spiritual sword in advance. The magic treasures he had looted previously weren’t suitable, so he planned to gather materials himself and forge the sword personally. This would also improve his crafting skills, preparing him for the eventual taming of the South Ming Flame.</p><p>A spiritual sword with a wood attribute, forged from spiritual wood, would be the most compatible.</p><p>Golden Sinking Wood was known for its hardness, and when forged into a treasure, it would gain an additional sharpness, making it an excellent choice.</p><p>After the two most important matters were settled, the Feather Demon King brought up a few minor issues, and the meeting soon drew to a close.</p><p>Finally, the demon kings took the opportunity to hold a small trading session, exchanging goods among themselves.</p><p>Having only recently advanced, Qin Sang’s wealth paled in comparison to these demon kings, so he could only watch enviously as treasures changed hands.</p><p>Most of what he possessed were items like demonic cores and bones, which would be difficult to explain if he presented them in front of so many demon kings.</p><p>After the trading concluded, the demon kings dispersed.</p><p>Qin Sang also prepared to leave the Demon City and head south.</p><p>The Red-Tailed Demon King bid Qin Sang farewell, promising to meet again in the future.</p><p>He had outright refused to join the war, stating that no treasure was worth risking his life for an outsider.</p><p>Returning to his residence, Qin Sang called for White Crane and Fat Chicken, purchased a few items in the Demon City, and then left the city.</p><p>Not long after leaving the city, Qin Sang and the two birds flew for a while before a glint suddenly flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He abruptly stopped and turned to look behind him.</p><p>The two birds quickly halted as well, following his gaze. They weren’t far from the Demon City, with only a few mountain ranges separating them.</p><p>At that moment, the mountains were eerily quiet, with no sign of anyone else.</p><p>"Master, what’s wrong?" Fat Chicken asked cautiously, sensing something amiss.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes swept the area before suddenly locking onto a mountain peak. He let out a cold snort and called out, "Fellow Daoist, you’ve been following me for so long. Surely, this isn’t a coincidence, is it?"</p>
