<h1>Chapter 752: Light Armor</h1><p>The Earth Flag slammed against the ancient barrier, meeting fierce resistance.</p><p>Waves of yellow light surged, relentlessly battering the stone hall, almost submerging it. The ground trembled violently, a deep rumbling echoing from below. Everyone struggled to maintain their balance, yet they firmly guarded the Earth Flag, sustaining the spirit array.</p><p>After a while, an encouraging sign appeared. The ancient barrier began to fluctuate wildly, its glow gradually fading.</p><p>Seeing this, Xiang Yi's face lit up with joy. "Fellow Daoists, continue!" he urgently shouted. "Pour all your power into the Earth Flag!"</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had no choice but to intensify their efforts.</p><p>A continuous stream of earth elemental energy converged, causing the ground to shake even more violently, as if a real earthquake was occurring. The booming sound was deafening, and cracks appeared on many of the stones.</p><p>Then, Xiang Yi extended a hand and pressed it firmly onto the triangular flag. In an instant, a blinding light erupted, like an arrow, shooting towards the barrier.</p><p>A loud boom echoed as a circular hole was blasted through the ancient barrier.</p><p>However, the barrier wasn't as simple as it appeared. After being breached by the Earth Flag, runes flickered within the opening, slowly restoring the barrier and repelling the yellow light.</p><p>Seeing this, Xiang Yi didn't dare to wait any longer. He retracted his hand and whispered, "Fellow Daoists, maintain the Earth Flag. I'll be back shortly."</p><p>With that, Xiang Yi released the Earth Flag, tapped his foot, and his figure flashed, appearing before the barrier. He then leaped inside.</p><p>Once he retrieved the treasure, their mission would be complete.</p><p>This thought brought a sense of relief to everyone.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly frowned, instinctively looking down at the ground.</p><p>Because of the Earth Flag, the ground had been trembling, especially where they stood. Cracks had appeared in the stones, but it hadn't seemed significant.</p><p>Now, it looked the same as before, but Qin Sang felt a strange unease he couldn't quite explain.</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>The earth shook.</p><p>Within the tremors, there was a rhythmic pulse.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression suddenly changed. Just as he was about to shout, the ground exploded beneath them without warning.</p><p>A powerful force erupted from below, tearing the ground apart.</p><p>They were completely caught off guard.</p><p>Rubble flew everywhere, creating chaos.</p><p>A deep hole appeared at the center of the explosion, and a slender figure shot into the air, writhing like a dragon.  Nearly ten feet of it extended above the ground, and who knew how much more was coiled below.</p><p>No one had noticed this beast lurking beneath them!</p><p>Because the triangular flag at the array's core was unattended, and the Earth Flag was focused on the barrier, offering no other protection, the beast easily shattered the array. The impact sent everyone flying, scattering them in all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly activated his Golden Glory Armor, blocking the impact, but his chest still felt tight.</p><p>This beast was definitely as strong as a late-stage Core Formation demon!</p><p>Even worse, they were separated and exposed to the encroaching purple fog outside the Bone Lotus's protection. Qin Sang felt a stinging sensation on his skin and hurriedly activated his protective spiritual light, his true essence rapidly depleting.</p><p>He was about to awaken Fatty Silkworm and regroup with the others when he suddenly sensed a strong wind above. He looked up sharply, his eyes widening in horror.</p><p>The purple fog above had thinned, revealing countless dark shadows – Purple Star Eagles!</p><p>Judging by the sheer number, it appeared the entire flock had descended.</p><p>They had easily evaded the eagles after crossing the canyon using the Purple Weasel as bait.  Never had they imagined the eagles would relentlessly pursue them all the way here.</p><p>And the eagles were already so close before they were discovered.</p><p>On second thought, it wasn't surprising. The commotion caused by the Earth Flag was significant, masking not only the movements of the subterranean beast, but also the sound of the eagles' wings.</p><p>Within the fog, they couldn't see outside, nor could they extend their divine sense. Their spiritual awareness was severely limited, making them practically blind.</p><p>Now, unable to even hear, it was no wonder they were unaware of the imminent danger.</p><p>They had set up warning formations before activating the Earth Flag, but for some reason, none of them had triggered.</p><p>Surrounded by beasts above and below, they were trapped.</p><p>The Purple Star Eagles glared down, their eyes burning with rage and madness. The air currents dispersed the fog, replaced by a dense swarm of eagles, blotting out the sky.</p><p>'Screech!'</p><p>The eagles shrieked furiously, seemingly filled with implacable hatred. They dove down recklessly, as if on a suicide mission.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The sight drained the color from everyone's faces. Even Qin Sang felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>He was positioned closest to the front, the first target of the eagles.</p><p>The others weren't much better off. Still reeling from the subterranean beast's attack, they were immediately swarmed by the eagles.</p><p>"Regroup at the stone hall..."</p><p>Qin Sang faintly heard Fellow Daoist Liu shout before losing sight of everyone amidst the overwhelming mass of eagles.</p><p>Fighting alone, their chances of survival against the eagles were slim. Even if they weren't killed by the eagles, they risked succumbing to the poisonous fog.</p><p>If Xiang Yi reacted quickly enough, he might have emerged from the stone hall when the chaos began. The Bone Lotus was with him; their only hope of escape lay in rejoining him.</p><p>At this point, there was no time to ponder why the subterranean beast and the eagles were here.</p><p>"Screech!"</p><p>The earsplitting cries of the eagles were deafening. One swooped down, talons extended towards Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Reacting instantly, Qin Sang flicked his wrist. The Ebony Sword flashed like lightning, piercing the eagle and exploding its body into a bloody mist.</p><p>Unfortunately, the other eagles showed no fear or hesitation. Driven by a killing frenzy, they disregarded their own lives.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. He manipulated the Ebony Sword, forming a sword array and slaying the nearest eagles, but the gap was quickly filled.</p><p>He frowned inwardly. Killing the eagles, while seemingly swift, was taking its toll.</p><p>Moreover, he had to constantly channel true essence to ward off the poison, making him a beacon in the eyes of the eagles.  He couldn't conceal himself, and at this rate, he would be exhausted before long.</p><p>"I wonder how the others are faring?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought grimly, continuing to wield his sword while reaching for his insect pouch.</p><p>Fatty Silkworm awoke, hopping onto his palm.  The plump creature wriggled, noticing the surrounding fog, and without hesitation, opened its mouth, emitting a seven-colored aura.</p>
