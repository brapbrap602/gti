<h1>Chapter 314: Auction at Obsidian Gate</h1><p>Fortunately, the current spiritual tide is only a precursor, still brewing. The real surge is still decades away.  During this period, the Heavenly March Alliance is unlikely to launch a full-scale war. At most, there will be minor skirmishes, testing each other's strength. If, as Senior Brother Qi suggested, the Alliance's intention is merely harassment, it would undoubtedly be the best outcome.  Hopefully, that is the case.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head inwardly and stepped into the Grand Elixir Pavilion.  A pretty attendant immediately greeted him. He opened his palm, showing a message talisman to the attendant in the hall.  The attendant hurriedly bowed and led Qin Sang to the top floor of the pavilion, where he met Elder Wen, the pavilion master.</p><p>Elder Wen, a close friend of Wanderer Yun, was in charge of the Grand Elixir Sect's business at Skull Pass, wielding considerable power.  Three years ago, Qin Sang had met him through Wanderer Yun and entrusted him with the task of gathering information about Soul-Guiding Grass. Although Mount Shaohua was no weaker than the Grand Elixir Sect in terms of overall strength, it was significantly inferior in terms of alchemical connections and resources. It was rumored that the Grand Elixir Sect even had a presence within the Demonic Sect’s territory, but the truth of this was known only to those within the sect.  Facts proved that Qin Sang had chosen the right person.</p><p>This message talisman had been delivered to his cave by Elder Wen, and it was the reason Qin Sang had emerged from seclusion.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, please have a seat!"  Elder Wen waved the attendant away and greeted him with a beaming smile.</p><p>"Qin Sang greets Elder Wen." Qin Sang cupped his hands in greeting and, at Elder Wen's warm invitation, savored the fragrant tea.</p><p>Elder Wen looked Qin Sang up and down, then his face registered surprise. "It's been three years. I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Qin to have already broken through to mid-Foundation Establishment. Congratulations!"</p><p>"Just lucky!" Qin Sang modestly replied, his face betraying no hint of pride.  Elder Wen's cultivation was comparable to Jade Sun.  He had heard from Wanderer Yun that Elder Wen, trapped at the late-Foundation Establishment bottleneck with no hope of advancement, had decided to abandon the path of immortality and manage the Grand Elixir Pavilion's business.  This man had not been an unknown figure in the Grand Elixir Sect, and his true strength was unfathomable.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, you've already seen the message talisman, haven't you?"  After some pleasantries, Elder Wen got straight to the point. "Soul-Guiding Grass is indeed rare. It's said to aid the cultivation of certain unorthodox cultivators. Whenever it appears, there are many vying for it.  I’ve contacted many friends, and in the past three years, it has appeared twice at Obsidian Gate, but by the time we learned about it, it was already too late.  Fortunately, this time the news came early enough.  It’s almost certain that Soul-Guiding Grass will appear at the upcoming auction."</p><p>The auction Elder Wen mentioned was described in the message talisman.  It was to be held at Obsidian Gate a year later.  Obsidian Gate was a melting pot of various factions: unorthodox cultivators, righteous and demonic cultivators, rogue cultivators – all sorts of people. Unlike other major passes, Obsidian Gate wasn't firmly controlled by a powerful force. It was quite chaotic, and valuable treasures often surfaced at its auctions.</p><p>Therefore, each auction attracted a lot of attention.  To acquire desired treasures at Obsidian Gate's auction, one needed considerable strength. No one dared to act recklessly there. There had been cases where those who lost bids tried to seize the treasures by force.  Without exception, they were swiftly suppressed, their bodies hung outside the gate as a warning to others.  It was said that the auction was backed by the city lord of Obsidian Gate, a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>Hearing Elder Wen's words, Qin Sang pondered. Soul-Guiding Grass was so sought-after that, if put up for auction, he might have to compete with late-Foundation Establishment cultivators. As for Core Formation cultivators, he didn't need to worry too much.  It was said that Obsidian Gate’s auctions were tiered; treasures that would interest Core Formation cultivators wouldn’t appear there.</p><p>By then, he would certainly have to spend a fortune. The spirit stones he had wouldn't be enough. Even if he were willing to sell his Yin-Yang Compass or Sky-Venom Gauze, there was no guarantee it would suffice. After all, anything could happen at an auction.  Besides the spiritual materials needed to refine the Concentric Rings, the only thing he could and was willing to part with seemed to be the Blue Dew Flower.</p><p>"Is it possible to contact the friend who possesses the Soul-Guiding Grass?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Elder Wen shook his head. "The auction rules are set by those above. If it weren't for the Grand Elixir Pavilion's good relationship with various factions at Obsidian Gate, we wouldn’t even know about the Soul-Guiding Grass. Aside from this, that friend wouldn't dare to divulge any other information, lest they lose their head…" Elder Wen gestured across his neck.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. He knew his question was somewhat wishful thinking, just a casual inquiry.</p><p>"What are your plans, Fellow Daoist Qin?" Elder Wen took a sip of tea.  "If you don't have time to go to Obsidian Gate, I can have someone bid on the Soul-Guiding Grass on your behalf."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then declined Elder Wen's kind offer, deciding to go to Obsidian Gate himself.  He had previously been afraid to travel freely, fearing capture by remnants of the Gloomfiend Sect.  Now that the Gloomfiend Sect had been destroyed and he had the Void Imprint to suppress the Heart-Devouring Worm's fluctuations, there was no harm in making the trip himself.  With the Gloomfiend Sect’s Core Formation cultivator practically crippled, even if any Foundation Establishment remnants discovered his tracks, with his current strength, he wouldn't fear them.</p><p>If he entrusted the task to someone from the Grand Elixir Pavilion, not only might they not put in their full effort, the price would be difficult to control.  If they bought it for too high a price, it would be a loss.  His limited resources couldn't withstand reckless spending. It was better to be present himself so he could adapt to the situation.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang inquired further about the auction rules, learning that it wasn't rigidly structured and didn’t prohibit transactions between bidders.  Bidders could exchange items with each other during the auction, each getting what they needed, achieving a mutually beneficial outcome.  Through this process, treasures could generally be exchanged at a desirable price, at least without fear of being lowballed by the auction house. This reinforced his decision to go in person.</p><p>After conversing with Elder Wen for a while longer, Qin Sang bid farewell and left the Grand Elixir Pavilion. The auction was still a year away. Qin Sang decided to return to the Heavenly Crystal Grotto to cultivate for a period and earn more spirit stones.  He would set off when the auction was about to begin.  Great change was imminent, time was pressing, and every moment counted. Every bit of improvement mattered. If he could break through to late-Foundation Establishment or even the pseudo-Core Formation realm before the war arrived, his chances of survival would undoubtedly increase significantly.</p><p>Wanderer Yun was still in seclusion.  Qin Sang returned his cave to the sect.  Senior Brother Rong had taken over Skull Pass affairs and made some changes to Senior Brother Qi Yuan’s previous arrangements. Qin Sang and the others cooperated with Senior Brother Rong, then bid farewell to their fellow disciples and left Skull Pass, entering the Ancient Battlefield.</p><p>Returning to the Ancient Battlefield with mid-Foundation Establishment cultivation, Qin Sang felt significantly more at ease.  He could easily handle some of the dangers he had previously feared with his current strength.  He flew swiftly on his sword, making almost no stops along the way, until he reached Brightsun Market.</p>
