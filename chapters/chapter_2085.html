<h1>Chapter 2076: Retreat</h1><p>Defeat should be considered before victory.</p><p>Facing a Nascent Soul master allows for no carelessness.</p><p>Qin Sang's first priority was considering how to safely retreat and avoid pursuit should the treasure acquisition fail and anger the Ye Venerable.</p><p>Ming Wei and the life-saving talisman in her possession were the safest route.  However, the talisman might not fully protect them, so she needed to carefully consider its optimal use.</p><p>"Fellow cultivator, you mean..."</p><p>Ming Wei hesitated.</p><p>She didn't fully believe Qin Sang.</p><p>A Nascent Soul master breaking the celestial barrier and traversing the trial realm was unheard of, a fantastical tale.</p><p>But Qin Sang's cautious demeanor forced her to consider the possibility.</p><p>The cavern was filled with various factions, including top experts like Blood Bat and Daoist Xiao Yun. Each posed a greater threat than she did.</p><p>Qin Sang had no reason to deceive her; it would only cripple his own plan.</p><p>Qin Sang turned, glancing at the cave mouth at the edge of the cavern. "Once the Ye Venerable makes a move, everyone else will be stunned, unable to react immediately. Our only opponent will be him. As long as we can escape the Ye Venerable, we'll be safe. Fellow cultivator, stay hidden with the talisman.  Once I succeed, return, and activate it immediately…"</p><p>Ming Wei remained silent.</p><p>She understood that this plan placed the greatest risk, facing the wrath of a Nascent Soul cultivator, squarely on Qin Sang's shoulders. She would simply observe from the rear.</p><p>If things went wrong, she could easily withdraw—the danger to her was minimal.</p><p>But this meant she would be far from the Soul Cleansing Liquid, leaving her no choice but to trust in Qin Sang's abilities and place all her hopes on him.</p><p>Ming Wei looked up, staring into Qin Sang's eyes. "Later, fellow cultivator, you won't just take your vial of Soul Cleansing Liquid and leave, will you?"</p><p>"Since we've chosen to offend the Ye Venerable, what difference does one vial make from two? With the talisman in your hands, I naturally must acquire a vial for you as well. Otherwise, if you, in anger, break your promise, I'll be left with no escape route—a crying shame, wouldn't it?  If you're still uneasy, I'll swear a heart demon oath."</p><p>The Soul Cleansing Liquid was their shared interest, the reason Qin Sang could trust Ming Wei.</p><p>Facing a powerful enemy, they had to remain firmly bound together.</p><p>"Good! I hope you will keep your promise!"</p><p>Ming Wei knew the situation was overwhelming; supply was far outstripped by demand, and her hopes were already slim. Having received Qin Sang’s promise, she retreated from the cavern.  But she saw Qin Sang follow her out.</p><p>Noticing Ming Wei's questioning gaze, Qin Sang said, "The Ye Venerable certainly knows the talisman's function; we can't use it under his nose. If he remains stationary, escape will be impossible. We need to create a diversion…"</p><p>They searched the cave walls for a suitable opening, and found one with the most complex network of passages.</p><p>Qin Sang laid a trap, releasing several corpse puppets from his pouch, sending them into the various tunnels. Under his command, they lay in wait.</p><p>Next, he flicked his sleeve, and nine miniature magic banners spiraled out!</p><p>For over ten years, Qin Sang had been working to master the nine-banner formation, and had achieved considerable success.</p><p>Ming Wei stared at the banners, surprised.</p><p>She could sense that these seemingly insignificant black banners were extraordinary.  Having been with a master cultivator, her experience surpassed that of others her level, and she couldn’t fully fathom their nature.</p><p>They seemed like battle flags, yet also like artifacts—quite unusual.</p><p>Ming Wei knew this treasure was Qin Sang's secret, so she suppressed her curiosity and didn’t ask.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The nine magic banners swirled rapidly, forming a complex formation in front of Qin Sang, seeming to exude black magical flames.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the array, sensing its power, and pressed his palm down.</p><p>‘Plop plop plop…’</p><p>The nine banners sank into the ground, disappearing completely.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to Ming Wei and turned back to the cavern.</p><p>Ming Wei, having already guessed Qin Sang’s intention, saw his figure disappear into the earth spirit army.  She took several puppets from her pouch and sent them into the deeper tunnels, while she held the talisman and watched the sealing barrier in the center of the cavern.</p><p>Her hand tightened, her heart pounding.</p><p>Back in the cavern,</p><p>Qin Sang soared into the earth spirit army, quickly advancing.</p><p>Cultivators were surrounding the sealing barrier; the destination of the Soul Cleansing Liquid would soon be decided.</p><p>Along the way, Bai emerged from the corpse puppet bag, exchanged a few words with Qin Sang, and then separated. The cavern's situation was chaotic; no one noticed Bai's true identity.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A sword swept away an earth spirit, breaking through the encirclement.</p><p>More earth spirits swarmed in, their power growing stronger the closer they got to the sealing barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang, alone with his sword, moved closer to the barrier, finally able to see the interior clearly.</p><p>A high platform stood at the barrier's center.</p><p>Its surface was etched with strange markings, resembling runes.</p><p>The platform was large, yet only four bottles of Soul-Cleansing Liquid sat upon it, leaving the space feeling empty.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it carefully, finding no mechanisms. He wondered how the liquid appeared there and its origin.</p><p>The seal remained unbroken; it wasn't time for a full-scale battle yet.</p><p>However, the cultivators each had their own hidden agendas, their positions carefully chosen; undercurrents swirled.</p><p>No one knew who was secretly allied with whom.</p><p>Without Elder Ye, things would have certainly escalated into a dramatic play of trust and betrayal.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the assembled cultivators, pausing on Elder Ye.</p><p>Like Xue Fu and the others, Elder Ye was diligently attacking the seal, inconspicuous. No one suspected a Yuan Ying master was among them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't use the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to spy on Elder Ye, fearing detection.</p><p>However, he observed Elder Ye's actions and noted some peculiarities.</p><p>Facing the earth spirit horde, Elder Ye appeared effortlessly calm. Despite his disguise, he displayed incredibly precise control over his true energy, alarming Qin Sang.</p><p>Behind Elder Ye,</p><p>Su Nu and the others formed a battle formation, entangled with the earth spirit army.</p><p>Su Nu's eyes lacked excitement, filled with worry.</p><p>She wasn't sure how much Qin Sang could accomplish.</p><p>If Qin Sang fell at Elder Ye's hand, she would have no hope left, only to await her fate.</p><p>The three elders with long beards were already exchanging messages, fantasizing about the future, their tone light, expressing great confidence in Elder Ye. Hearing them, Su Nu forced a smile and deflected their conversation.</p><p>"Boom! Boom!"</p><p>Sword energy, blade glows,</p><p>Magical techniques, magical treasures,</p><p>Attacks rained down on the sealing barrier.</p><p>The barrier trembled incessantly, its light dimming and thinning.</p><p>The cultivators stared intently at the Soul-Cleansing Liquid within, poised to strike.</p><p>Qin Sang chose not to get too close to the seal, remaining at the periphery while fending off earth spirits. He also directed bursts of sword energy and light towards the seal with his ebony sword.</p><p>His attention remained fixed on Elder Ye.</p><p>(End of chapter)</p>
