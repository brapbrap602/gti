<h1>Chapter 1797: The Mole Cricket Mountain</h1><p>After explaining how to contact Qin Sang, Mo Xingdao continued, "Hong Yuzi was severely injured this time. The pills can only temporarily alleviate his condition. He needs to return to the Daoist Court to recuperate for a while and shouldn't be coming back here anytime soon.  I also can't act alone.  Once he's recovered, I'll send word to you before we act again.  Where are you staying?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then said, "Send the message to Hu Zhong City. I'll make the arrangements."</p><p>They agreed on a unique symbol as a secret mark.</p><p>When Mo Xingdao and Hong Yuzi returned to the area and delved deeper into the altar, Qin Sang would follow them. Mo Xingdao would secretly leave clues, and they would act as the opportunity presented itself.</p><p>This was just a rough plan.</p><p>After all, Mo Xingdao was controlled by Hong Yuzi and had little freedom, severely limiting his actions.</p><p>Times change, and no one can predict the future. They could only maintain contact and adapt accordingly.</p><p>Whether Qin Sang would agree to participate would depend on his own situation at the time.</p><p>The undercurrents between Gui Fang and the Daoist Court might offer opportunities to exploit.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, then asked, "Did you discover anything during your exploration of the altar?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao had previously mentioned that he and Hong Yuzi had entered the altar with two objectives: to investigate the Gui Fang demons' plans and to search for a place that matched Mo Xingdao's memories.</p><p>"Nothing,"</p><p>Mo Xingdao replied, "The deeper we went, the more complex and dangerous it became.  Hong Yuzi could manage alone, but he had to constantly protect me. My old wounds hadn't healed, so even without this incident, it was incredibly difficult."</p><p>After a pause, Mo Xingdao continued, "I'll tell you about some scenes from my memories. If you have the time, you can search for them. It will give us the advantage."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. Wasn't Mo Xingdao afraid that he would find a way out and ascend alone?</p><p>But then he thought, even if there was a way out deep within the altar, it would likely lead to the Abyss and not necessarily directly back to the ascension path.  Falling into the chaos of the deep Abyss would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>He had never been to the Abyss before, and teaming up with Mo Xingdao was the wisest choice.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, Mo Xingdao had no other option.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor and the Daoist Court behind him were like a mountain, preventing Mo Xingdao from acting rashly.</p><p>Qin Sang was the only external force he could rely on.</p><p>In the Storm World, he had interacted with Qin Sang several times. He had heard the assessments of Qin Sang from people like the Hui Guang Saint and had some understanding of Qin Sang's character. Mo Xingdao clearly remembered and greatly admired how Qin Sang, at the late Yuan Ying stage, had managed to deal with two Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Then, Mo Xingdao replayed some fragments of his memories.</p><p>Scenes flooded Qin Sang's mind, mostly chaotic.  Seeing them stirred up his own memories.</p><p>He recalled his experience falling into the spatial turbulence, a feeling of helplessness and despair welling up.</p><p>Even the clearest memory fragments were blurry, but Qin Sang could sense something unusual in these scenes—they resembled the illusions created by various divine abilities within the altar. No wonder Hong Yuzi had suspected this place.</p><p>"And our experience this time," Mo Xingdao said, before Qin Sang could respond, passing on more information.</p><p>Their exploration wasn't a simple investigation; they were searching for the ascension path.  They would find a foothold and carve a relatively safe path at each stage of their journey.</p><p>Hong Yuzi had made some preparations beforehand. Initially, they progressed quickly, but their speed slowed down later.</p><p>In the deepest part, there were almost no auspicious clouds. There were no gaps between the illusions and remnants of divine abilities; they had to force their way through using their own strength.</p><p>"Hong Yuzi entered a pure white light domain, which wasn't dangerous at first. Then a golden light erupted, triggering a wave of light.  Shortly after the light wave appeared, Hong Yuzi was severely injured and returned. I was behind him and escaped," Mo Xingdao recounted the scene, still somewhat shaken.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, noting the location.</p><p>He didn't necessarily have to retrace Hong Yuzi's steps. The search was aimless to begin with; he could approach from a different direction. He could choose a path suitable for his abilities.</p><p>For example, he could easily pass through illusions that attacked the soul or affected the spirit.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was about to say more when his tone suddenly changed, and he said in a low voice, "Hong Yuzi has woken up! Qin Daoist friend, until next time!"</p><p>With that, the features on the stone disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang reached out to grab the stone, and the moment it landed in his hand, its shape changed dramatically, transforming into a cold stone figure.</p><p>This was Mo Xingdao's token.</p><p>Qin Sang put it into his Qianjun Ring and immediately felt a divine sense sweeping over him. Remaining calm, he got up and flew back to the stone pavilion.</p><p>Mo Xingdao stood with his hands clasped at one corner of the pavilion. Their eyes met for a brief moment, then looked away, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Hong Yuzi had refined the spiritual pill; his aura was stable, and he showed almost no signs of injury, only a faint paleness to his face.</p><p>Then, other cultivators arrived one after another.</p><p>Hong Yuzi glanced at everyone, flicked his wrist, and sent a talisman to Qin Sang.  "I and Wan Zhenren have set up a protective formation here.  Please, Qingfeng Zhenren, take this talisman and use it to guide our fellow cultivators."</p><p>"Certainly!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, accepted the talisman, and cautioned the cultivators beside him to be careful.</p><p>The others looked grave, except for Zhijian Zhenren, who smiled calmly, saying it was fine.</p><p>Qin Sang knew Zhijian Zhenren's strength was far greater than it appeared. His swordsmanship, comparable to a Transcendence cultivator, proved it.  It was a pity that they were forced to separate this time, preventing him from witnessing the full display of that supreme sword technique.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>The cultivators transformed into beams of light and vanished in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the stone pavilion, sat cross-legged, and placed the talisman on his knees.  After a slight sense, he discovered the existence of the formation.</p><p>This formation was subtly integrated with the gray barrier, making it difficult to detect before activation.  Through the formation, Qin Sang could perceive the situation outside the barrier, allowing him to detect any pursuers in advance.</p><p>After the others left, the stone pavilion was silent.</p><p>Reflecting on the events of their journey, Qin Sang was curious about the source of the golden light and the demons' plans, but he quickly cautioned himself not to delve too deep and avoid being drawn into the main battle.</p><p>He suppressed his thoughts, while calming the lingering effects of the Wood Spirit energy in his body, and also monitoring the depths of the ritual grounds.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>More than half an hour quickly went by.</p><p>The golden light had subsided, and the disturbance affecting the entire ritual grounds was gradually calming, making the surroundings quieter.</p><p>There were no more unusual occurrences from the depths of the ritual grounds, nor did the cultivators return.</p><p>Qin Sang had nothing to do, his thoughts churning as he replayed events in his mind.  Encountering Mo Xingdao disrupted his previous plans. He needed to gather his thoughts and organize them properly, pursuing his cultivation and the path to ascension simultaneously.</p><p>Just as he was pondering, a faint light flickered on a thin cloud path shaped like a auspicious cloud, appearing through a gap in the illusory barrier ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression tightened. Upon closer inspection, he confirmed it was a beam of light flying towards him.  The energy was weak, and the speed was slow, only equivalent to that of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>At this point, the cultivators present at the Jushan ritual grounds were at least at the Transformation stage.</p><p>"Could someone be seriously injured?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Someone returning wounded so quickly—could the demons have gained the upper hand?</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly stood up, his expression shifting. But as the light drew closer, he suddenly noticed something amiss.</p><p>"How could it be him?"</p><p>Seeing who it was, Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>The person was a tall, thin Daoist with a familiar face—Yunwei Zhenren from Lougu Mountain!</p><p>Qin Sang had sparred with him years ago when they were vying for the right to collect the Four Seasons Dream Flowers.</p><p>Yunwei Zhenren was carrying a female cultivator.  Her face was pale, and her breathing was weak.  She lay motionless in his arms, clearly seriously injured.</p><p>As he flew, Yunwei Zhenren checked the female cultivator's condition repeatedly, his face filled with anxiety.</p><p>"Why is he here?"</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.</p><p>Judging by his cultivation, Yunwei Zhenren was still at the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator, with enough courage and preparation, could traverse the Nine-Curve Star River and explore its outer reaches to broaden their horizons.  However, to venture deeper, even Transformation stage cultivators had to proceed cautiously.</p><p>Yunwei Zhenren had come from the depths of the ritual grounds.  For a mere Nascent Soul cultivator to go that far was incredibly daring.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the female cultivator and found she was also a Nascent Soul cultivator, making the situation even stranger.</p><p>He stood in the pavilion, watching Yunwei and the female cultivator without making a move.</p><p>"Senior, please open the formation!"</p><p>Arriving before the gray barrier, Yunwei's eyes shone with hope as he shouted loudly, throwing out a divine talisman.</p><p>Seeing the talisman, Qin Sang pondered for a moment before opening the formation. It was a prearranged signal between him and Hong Yuzi. Yunwei's knowledge of this talisman indicated he had been guided here by Hong Yuzi.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p>Yunwei was overjoyed.  He carried the female cultivator and rushed through the layers of the gray barrier to the pavilion. Still anxious, he performed a great bow of thanks. "Please, Senior, save my junior sister!"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the female cultivator and said calmly, "Who sent you?"</p><p>"It was Senior Hong Yuzi and Senior Wan Zhenren.  My master and I encountered them. My master accepted their request to deal with the demons.  We acted hastily, managing only to temporarily suppress my junior sister's injuries, but they're worsening.  Senior Wan Zhenren directed me here, hoping you would save her…"</p><p>Yunwei spoke rapidly, his anxiety understandable; the female cultivator's breath was getting weaker, and an unnatural flush spread across her face.</p><p>The Lougu Mountain Patriarch had arrived, but why would he risk bringing his disciples here?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled a past conversation between Youyi and Yunwei.  Had the Lougu Mountain Patriarch discovered some treasure at the Jushan altar, prompting him to take such a risk?</p><p>"Senior, just suppress the strange energy within my junior sister.  Once Master returns, he can treat her injuries," Yunwei said urgently, fearing Qin Sang's refusal.</p><p>Suppressing the energy wouldn't consume much True Qi, but it was extremely strange, spreading throughout his junior sister's organs.  It would take time to seal it away completely.</p><p>With the Dao Court matter pressing, the Lougu Mountain Patriarch didn't want to offend the two high-ranking officials, so he agreed, ordering Yunwei to bring the nun here.</p><p>Lougu Mountain was renowned for its expertise in poison and talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang had long considered contacting Lougu Mountain; he hadn't expected this encounter.  Even if Wan Zhenren hadn't requested it, he would have helped.</p><p>After instructing Yunwei to lay the nun on the ground, Qin Sang used his fingers to probe her forehead, carefully examining her condition.</p><p>Yunwei, relieved, finally noticed Qin Sang.  The more he looked, the more familiar Qin Sang seemed, prompting a look of surprise.</p><p>When he heard Wan Zhenren mention the Daoist name "Qingfeng Zhenren," Yunwei hadn't thought much of it. He never imagined it was him!  They had once fought on a dueling platform.</p><p>Now, reunited, Qin Sang had achieved ascension, while he himself remained stuck at the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Yunwei's expression was complex.  Seeing Qin Sang's eyes open, he asked anxiously, "Senior, my junior sister…"</p><p>"Daoist Yunwei, we've had our clashes.  It's been many years; you don't recognize me anymore?" Qin Sang chuckled lightly.</p><p>Yunwei's lips trembled.  He said with a wry smile, "Senior has transcended our realm; I wouldn't dare be disrespectful."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, ceasing to insist.  He looked down at the nun. "Suppressing the energy shouldn't be difficult, but I wonder where this energy originated?"</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Yunwei was initially overjoyed, then hesitated.</p><p>Seeing his difficulty, Qin Sang rephrased his question, "Might this energy be a type of poison?"</p><p>Having examined the nun and encountered the strange energy, Qin Sang had made a discovery.  It felt both like and unlike a poison, quite peculiar.</p><p>"With my limited knowledge, I cannot confirm if it's poison, but it certainly is related.  The energy appeared suddenly after the golden light burst forth.  There was no warning, and my junior sister couldn't dodge…"</p><p>Yunwei's eyes lit up; he remembered that Qin Sang was also a master of poisons, unaffected by their sect's Xiaoyuan Hui curse.</p><p>"Senior, could you remove the energy?"  Yunwei asked anxiously, a glimmer of hope in his eyes, fearing he might anger Qin Sang.</p><p>Before his breakthrough, Qin Sang could easily resist the Xiaoyuan Hui curse.  Now, with his enhanced cultivation, his poison skills must have improved further.  The prolonged presence of the energy could leave unknown problems; it was best removed sooner rather than later.</p><p>"Let's try," Qin Sang said calmly, his fingertips emitting a strange light as they penetrated the nun's body.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang secretly activated his poison pearl, allowing it to subtly infiltrate and absorb a strand of the energy.</p><p>The nun's energy wasn't abundant, but it was extremely strange, deeply rooted and unlike anything ever seen, even perplexing the Lougu Mountain Patriarch.</p><p>However, Qin Sang found that removing it all with his poison pearl wasn't difficult, but he feigned deep thought.</p><p>After a while…</p><p>Seeing his junior sister's complexion improve, Yunwei was overjoyed, his admiration for Qin Sang growing.</p><p>With the crisis averted, Yunwei's tense nerves finally relaxed, allowing him to consider other matters. A look of joy flashed in his eyes, as though remembering something.</p><p>After a long time, Qin Sang removed all the energy and slowly withdrew his power. The nun's face was flushed, though her breath remained weak from her severe injuries, but she was out of danger.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior, for saving my junior sister's life. Lougu Mountain is eternally grateful," Yunwei bowed deeply, filled with admiration. "Senior's skill with poison surpasses that of your past self; few in the world can compare!"</p><p>"I wouldn't say that; I merely possess some skill in detoxification. I've long admired your Master's prowess in poison talismans," Qin Sang replied calmly.</p><p>"Knowing there's a fellow practitioner like Senior, Master will be overjoyed," Yunwei said, showering him with praise.</p><p>His gaze flickered, hesitant, before he swallowed his words.  With his Master present, he couldn't make decisions independently and would have to wait for his Master's return.</p>
