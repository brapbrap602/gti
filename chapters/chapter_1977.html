<h1>Chapter 1968: I Don't Want To</h1><p>The valley was filled with swirling clouds and vibrant mists, a thin fog clinging to the air.  Waterfalls cascaded like silken ribbons, and the sound of clear springs echoed through the tranquil scene.  To any outsider, this would appear a sacred land of immortals.  They could never imagine that this place was a gathering point for demons and devils, led by the Corpse Demons of the Fallen Soul Abyss.</p><p>Suddenly, a shadow fell upon the valley, shrouded in thick demonic clouds.</p><p>“Who goes there!”</p><p>A furious shout erupted from the valley, and a dozen figures flew out.</p><p>Before they could discern what lay within the demonic clouds, a five-colored stream of light shot forth, hurtling towards a stone hall at the valley’s edge.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The light flashed past, leaving everyone staring in stunned silence.</p><p>A perfectly intact stone hall had vanished before their very eyes.</p><p>“That… was Senior Lu’s cave dwelling.  Senior Lu hasn’t… gone out recently, has he…?”</p><p>A young man stammered, his voice trembling as he swallowed hard.</p><p>Senior Lu was rumored to be a Nascent Soul Patriarch from the Fallen Soul Abyss, known for his eccentric temper.  Although he chose a cave dwelling at the valley’s edge, even the powerful cultivators in the valley’s depths treated him with respect.</p><p>“Senior Lu’s disciples were inside… along with some Gloom Origin Mountain experts… they’ve all vanished!”</p><p>A Nascent Soul Patriarch and over a dozen powerful demonic cultivators, without a trace of resistance, were instantly obliterated by the five-colored stream of light.  It was likely that those inside the hall never knew what hit them, or who had killed them, right up until their deaths!</p><p>Terror gripped everyone's hearts, their faces etched with fear.  They turned to flee, but it was too late.  Their vision filled with a five-colored radiance, and then they knew nothing more.</p><p>Like the stone hall, they vanished without a trace.</p><p>*Clang! Clang! Clang!*</p><p>An urgent bell tolled below.  The cultivators in the valley, sensing the anomaly, sounded the alarm.</p><p>In an instant, the entire valley erupted in chaos.  Awakened by the bell, cultivators streamed out of their caves.  Silhouettes hovered in mid-air, all gazing upwards.</p><p>Then, grayish-white smoke surged from the valley. This smoke was pure corpse Qi, refined through special methods.  The corpse Qi shot skyward like pillars, eighty-one in total.</p><p>The eighty-one streams of corpse Qi reached the sky, dispersed, and merged, forming a grayish-white cloud mass directly beneath the demonic clouds.  It seemed to support the demonic clouds, preventing them from pressing down upon the valley.</p><p>Deep within the valley, above a gloomy stone hall, several figures floated.  Their eyes shimmered with multicolored light as they channeled their spiritual vision and other divine abilities, peering through the demonic clouds to catch a glimpse of the figure within.</p><p>Despite knowing that appearances can be deceiving in the cultivation world, their expressions grew strange.</p><p>“Who is that woman?” someone asked.</p><p>“Could she be an expert from Cloud Metropolis Heaven, seeking revenge?  We were only following Master Qi’s orders.  Did someone break a taboo?”</p><p>Their question was answered by a deafening roar.  The earth shook violently, and the mountains on either side of the valley trembled, nearly collapsing.  The newly formed corpse cloud shattered, on the verge of dissipating.</p><p>Everyone cried out in alarm, their faces filled with dread.  This place was only a temporary base, protected by a single Ascending Gloom Formation.  There were no other formations.</p><p>Their opponent hadn’t even used that five-colored stream of light yet, and just the pressure from the demonic clouds was enough to bring the Ascending Gloom Formation to the brink of collapse.  What terrifying power!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>As if they had encountered a devil even more terrifying than themselves, they lost all will to fight and scattered in every direction.</p><p>The corpse cloud cracked, and demonic Qi poured down.  The sight was too terrifying, beyond their comprehension.  The demons and devils in the valley were paralyzed with fear, scattering like birds and beasts.  The entire valley descended into utter chaos.</p><p>A black-robed figure successfully escaped the valley and couldn't resist glancing back.  Seeing the panicked crowd within, he was about to congratulate himself when a five-colored radiance, as fast as lightning, shot towards him.</p><p>The black-robed figure paled, instinctively summoning his prized magic treasure, a white banner inscribed with ghostly runes.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Ghost Rune Banner unfurled like a silken bolt of cloth, stretching across the air.</p><p>The next moment, a soft *poof* sounded as the five-colored radiance effortlessly pierced through the banner.</p><p>The black-robed figure’s eyes widened as he watched the five-colored radiance strike him, and he vanished on the spot.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded everywhere.  None of the first experts to escape the valley were spared.</p><p>Meanwhile, violent booms echoed from within the valley.  Streams of corpse Qi collapsed one after another, and the corpse cloud was completely dispersed.  The Ascending Gloom Formation hadn't even lasted a single breath.  The corpse Qi surged back to the ground, transforming into a furious wind that swept across the land.  Halls and pavilions crumbled.</p><p>Some cultivators not from the Fallen Soul Abyss accidentally inhaled the corpse Qi, and countless blood blisters immediately erupted on their bodies, causing unbearable itching.  They scratched frantically, bursting the blisters and covering themselves in blood, but the pain did nothing to alleviate the itching.  They rolled on the ground, their flesh turning a ghastly bluish-black at a visible rate.</p><p>Screams of agony filled the valley.</p><p>The five-colored stream of light rained down like scattered flower petals, ending their suffering.</p><p>Hundreds of cultivators in the valley were slaughtered in the blink of an eye, leaving no survivors.</p><p>Xiao Wu vented her fury through the carnage.  At the same time, scenes of suffering reflected in her demonic eyes.  A flicker of hesitation appeared in her gaze, and a struggle played across her face.  She hovered motionless.</p><p>Suddenly, a furious roar echoed from the distance.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A pale stream of corpse Qi shot from the horizon, steered by the white-haired man.</p><p>“Who are you!”</p><p>The white-haired man scrutinized Xiao Wu from afar, realizing she was unfamiliar, not one of the Nine Immortals of Cloud Metropolis.</p><p>“Could she be a newly ascended expert from Cloud Metropolis Heaven?”</p><p>This thought flashed through the white-haired man’s mind, and he shouted, “No matter your identity, slaughtering hundreds without cause, this old man will demand an explanation from Cloud Metropolis Heaven!”</p><p>As he spoke, the white-haired man met Xiao Wu’s gaze, and his heart skipped a beat.</p><p>The next moment, the Five Elements Divine Light was upon him.</p><p>He lasted longer than the cultivators in the valley, but it didn't change the outcome.  A dignified Soul Formation expert, sent to manage the situation, believing it to be a comfortable assignment away from the most dangerous conflicts, perished here inexplicably.</p><p>Xiao Wu, her attention drawn by the white-haired man, flew forward instinctively.  She was still struggling, her delicate body trembling slightly as she fought against the demonic nature within.</p><p>Soon, she encountered Yin Shi.  With a casual point of her finger, Yin Shi died without a sound.</p><p>Wherever she went, countless cultivators met the same fate as Yin Shi at Xiao Wu's hands.  There was no telling if any innocents were among them.</p><p>Xiao Wu moved forward intermittently, struggling against the demonic influence that intensified with each kill, her inner conflict reflected in her increasingly tormented expression.</p><p>Finally, a city appeared ahead.  This was a cultivator market city, home to not only cultivators but also mortals.</p><p>Demonic clouds enveloped the market, plunging it into darkness.  Fear gripped everyone within.</p><p>From above, Xiao Wu saw them all, saw the fear in their eyes, and her struggle intensified.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Sha Jiayu and Yu Lang finally caught up.</p><p>“Senior Sister!”</p><p>Yu Lang called out.</p><p>Sha Jiayu tried to stop him, but Yu Lang firmly refused.  He flew into the demonic clouds and stood before Xiao Wu.</p><p>“Senior Sister, his name is Wu Lang.”</p><p>Yu Lang gently unfolded the infant’s swaddling clothes, showing him to Xiao Wu.</p><p>Perhaps because Xiao Wu appeared as a young girl, the infant wasn’t afraid.  Instead, he seemed curious about her black eyes, reaching out his hands and babbling, wanting to be held.</p><p>Xiao Wu stared at the infant, and the demonic Qi actually began to recede.  She didn't take the baby, just continued to watch him quietly.</p><p>After a long while, she slowly closed her eyes.</p><p>In that instant, the light seemed to brighten, and Yu Lang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Sha Jiayu finally dared to approach, whispering, “Xiao Wu is suppressing the demonic nature.  Don’t disturb her.”</p><p>The demonic clouds churned as Xiao Wu’s expression gradually calmed.  Manipulating the clouds, she swept up Yu Lang and Sha Jiayu and flew away.</p><p>As the demonic clouds drifted away, the people in the market felt a sense of relief, as if they had survived a great calamity.</p><p>Xiao Wu flew slowly, retracing her steps, seemingly heading back to North廓 County.</p><p>Passing over West Five Village, she suddenly stopped.</p><p>Following her gaze, the two saw a burned willow tree beside the village.  Despite the charred trunk, a touch of green remained at its base.  New branches were sprouting from the roots.  Slender branches, vibrant green buds.</p><p>They swayed gently in the breeze.</p><p>The Willow Demon was gone, and it might not revive because of this, but it symbolized the hope of rebirth, precious and irreplaceable.</p><p>Yu Lang and Sha Jiayu exchanged glances, then stepped forward.  “Senior Sister, let’s bring it back to Green Ram Temple?”</p><p>“It probably wants to continue guarding this place,” Xiao Wu murmured.</p><p>Yu Lang urged, “It’s too weak now.  Let’s bring it back to Green Ram Temple to be with Wu Lang.  When it grows bigger, we can bring it back.”</p><p>Xiao Wu didn’t respond, watching as Yu Lang used his magic to uproot the entire willow tree.  Then, in a flash, they returned to North廓 County, to Chen Ya’er’s house.</p><p>She removed the rubble with her hands, revealing the bodies of Chen Ya’er and his wife.  She tidied their appearance and carried them to a mountain outside the city.</p><p>Choosing a location with good feng shui, she dug a grave, preparing to bury them where they could see North廓 County and the river Chen Ya’er had guarded his whole life.</p><p>Finally, Xiao Wu took out a scroll.  This painting was one of the ones she had painted when Green Ram Temple was first established, depicting Chen Ya’er fishing.  It had once adorned the temple windows, but after being exposed to the elements, it had faded and Qin Sang had stored it away.  Qin Sang returned the paintings to her when she left the mountain.</p><p>Unrolling the scroll, Xiao Wu’s eyes filled with remembrance as she looked at the image.  She gently placed the painting over Chen Ya’er and his wife, burying them together.</p><p>Yu Lang held the infant and bowed towards the grave.</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded at him and soared into the sky.</p><p>“Let’s go back,” Sha Jiayu said, stepping forward.</p><p>“I want to go home and see,” Yu Lang whispered.</p><p>Back at Green Ram Tea House, he had also thought of his hometown, but his worry for his senior sister had kept him from mentioning it.</p><p>Sha Jiayu sighed and patted Yu Lang’s shoulder.  “Your brother will go with you.”</p><p>…</p><p>It was the same road, only now there were no refugees fleeing.</p><p>She and her master had once administered medicine and saved lives here.</p><p>Xiao Wu's expression shifted slightly.  She landed on the ground, and with a gentle tap of her toe, a puff of white smoke rose, revealing an elderly man.</p><p>“Immortal, spare me! Immortal, spare me!”</p><p>The old man was the same Earth God from before.  She remembered when her master had given him the jade pendant to control the demons and devils, how ambitious and full of spirit he had been.  Now, he was hunched over, bowing repeatedly, his spirit seemingly broken.</p><p>Xiao Wu sighed.  “Do you remember me?”</p><p>The Earth God paused, cautiously raising his head.  His face lit up with joy.  “You’re Fairy Xiao Wu! Has the Daoist Priest also returned?”</p><p>The Earth God looked around expectantly.</p><p>“Master isn’t here.”</p><p>Xiao Wu shook her head slightly.  “What happened to you?  Where are Yin’er and the others?”</p><p>This question brought a wave of sorrow over the Earth God’s heart.  He began to pour out his woes.</p><p>“After the Daoist Priest and Fairy left, this old man wanted to revitalize the Divine Dao, using the jade pendant the Daoist Priest left to command the demons and devils.  Things went smoothly at first, but not for long.  Just as things were looking up, I sensed something was amiss.</p><p>“I felt danger and didn’t dare to make a big show of things.  Later, the atmosphere grew increasingly strange, and I had to abandon my foundation and hide in the mountains.</p><p>“As for the demons and devils, I gave a warning to those who had reformed and let them go.  I didn't dare keep the unrepentant ones around, so I ended their lives to prevent them from harming others.</p><p>“Later, as the cultivation world grew more chaotic, I didn’t even dare to stay in the Earth God Temple.  I destroyed the temple myself and hid here, barely clinging to life.</p><p>“As for Yin’er and the other two girls, they continued to serve as temple attendants after they got married.  I could only send them away to live among ordinary people.</p><p>“Rest assured, Fairy, they have my mark on them and are safe now.”</p><p>After slaying the Corpse Demons of the Fallen Soul Abyss, including a Soul Formation expert, Xiao Wu had learned part of the plan.</p><p>This game of the mortal world would be played in the 'human realm,' where neither side would directly interfere with magic power.</p><p>Of course, this didn’t mean that the players were all mortals.  Both sides would send disciples down the mountain, sealing their cultivation and controlling mortal forces, to compete through worldly means.  The nations of the human world were the pieces on the board, warring against each other.</p><p>For Yin'er and the others, the greatest threat was not demons and devils, but the wars of mankind.</p><p>Xiao Wu pondered for a moment, then waved her small hand.  Five-colored radiance flashed, coalescing into a multicolored robe in her hand, which she offered to the Earth God.</p><p>“Wear this robe and be cautious.  Even Soul Formation cultivators won't be able to detect you.”</p><p>This was formed from the power of the Five Elements Divine Light.</p><p>The Earth God was both surprised and overjoyed.  He could hardly imagine what kind of treasure could conceal one's presence from a Soul Formation cultivator's spiritual sense.  He understood why Xiao Wu had expended her power to refine this robe for him, and immediately swore,  “This old man swears to heaven, I will stake my life to protect Yin’er and the others from even a single hair's breadth of harm!  They live in a small town three hundred miles from here.  Would the Fairy like to see them?”</p><p>Xiao Wu hesitated for a moment, then gently shook her head.  “We’ll meet again.”</p><p>Before the words faded, Xiao Wu vanished.</p><p>After bidding farewell to the Earth God, Xiao Wu didn't go anywhere else.  She didn't want to stop for even a moment, flying with all her might back to the Yan Kingdom.</p><p>Finally, Xiao Wu saw Green Ram Temple.  Like a wanderer returning home, her heart found peace.</p><p>The tranquil and harmonious village.</p><p>The lively schoolhouse.</p><p>Standing on the stone outside the temple gate was a Daoist priest, her master, waiting for her return.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t speak, his gaze gentle as he watched Xiao Wu land.</p><p>Xiao Wu pursed her lips, her face full of grievance.  She clutched Qin Sang’s robe tightly, snuggling close to him.</p><p>“Master, I don’t want to go down the mountain anymore.”</p>
