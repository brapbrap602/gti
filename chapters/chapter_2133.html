<h1>Chapter 2123: The Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Method</h1><p>Great Compassion Temple.</p><p>Located in the desert, the climate is arid, with few rains throughout the year.</p><p>Yet now, torrential rain is pouring down.  Darkness engulfs all sides, only the sound of the tempestuous rain is audible, as if the heavens have sprung a leak, an endless deluge of water cascading from above.</p><p>This violent downpour has continued for a long time without respite, with rainfall sufficient to inundate any location.</p><p>However, no rivers or lakes have formed on the earth; the desert remains unchanged. The rainwater seeps into the ground immediately, as if there’s a bottomless pit beneath, insatiable even to the most abundant rainfall.</p><p>Several monks levitate above the Great Compassion Temple, encircling an elder monk.</p><p>The elder monk has sallow skin, a gaunt frame, yet his eyes shine with a compelling brilliance, like a bronze statue.</p><p>To his left stands a young monk who glances around anxiously, finally using his enhanced vision to scan the far west.</p><p>The rain pours down, and occasionally a flash of lightning illuminates the heavens within the downpour.</p><p>The number and intensity of these lightning strikes are far less than before.</p><p>Since the commencement of the conflict, the altar transformed the desert into a lake of thunder, and the thunder talismans possessed earth-shattering power; the scene of countless thunderbolts striking simultaneously had become commonplace.  The Western cultivators finally witnessed firsthand the terrifying power of the battle between Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>This kind of battle, capable of manipulating the power of heaven, was beyond their previous comprehension. In comparison, the war between the Storm Realm and the Changyou Tribe was like two children clumsily and laughably fighting with weapons.</p><p>A short while ago, the thunder suddenly vanished, and the intensity lessened.</p><p>However, as the relentless rain continued until now, the invisible pressure gradually accumulated, becoming increasingly terrifying.</p><p>Indeed, the altar’s power hasn't diminished; the downpour firmly holds the enemy at bay.</p><p>“If the enemy breaks through this barrage, they will approach the temple,” the young monk whispered, his voice laced with worry.</p><p>For over a year, the enemy has consecutively breached numerous defensive formations. Each loss resulted in the Storm Realm retreating significantly, abandoning vast swathes of land.</p><p>Today, the Western desert is largely occupied.  If one were to observe from above, a clear boundary would be visible: The eastern side remains a desolate expanse of sand; the west, however, has undergone a dramatic transformation, changing from desert into mountains and verdant waters.</p><p>The desert's revival brings not hope, but intense danger.</p><p>The loss of the desert represents not only territorial conquest but also the destruction of meticulously constructed altars within the desert. Fortunately, Qin Sang did not abandon the cultivators guarding the altars; they retreated safely after each loss.  Therefore, while the Storm Realm appears to be repeatedly retreating, its casualties are not severe.</p><p>Now, the enemy is close. Master Huaiyin, together with the monks, holds the line at the altar in the Great Compassion Temple's rear mountains. To retreat further would mean abandoning the temple.</p><p>Reluctant to relocate, the monks of the Great Compassion Temple do not wish to relive the painful memories of the past.</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>The elder monk, an elder of the Arhat Hall, clasped his hands together, his expression neither sorrowful nor joyful. “Have faith in the Grand Master’s plan.”</p><p>A fierce battle rages within the rain curtain.</p><p>For this battle, Qin Sang carefully selected multiple thunder talismans from the Five Thunder Envoy Pavilion Seal, similar to the Twelve Thunder God Talismans, all suitable for large-scale combat. The Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Method is one of them.</p><p>It draws the water of the Nine Heavens Azure Pool down to the world, without visible thunderbolts, yet the power of thunder is everywhere. The raindrops aren't ordinary water, but rather celestial energy transformed into thunderous water; each drop contains immense power.</p><p>As the rainwater falls to the earth, the power of thunder dissipates and returns to the heavens, in a continuous cycle, ensuring the downpour doesn’t cause a flood in the desert.</p><p>Qin Sang watches ahead impassively; the rain explodes upon contact with his body, his figure shrouded in mist.</p><p>The rain is teeming with activity.</p><p>The raindrops, upon impact, transform into thunder soldiers—creatures without intelligence, consciousness, or the capacity to feel pain; pure instruments of slaughter.</p><p>However, Qin Sang can channel the will of cultivators from various branch altars through the main altar, infusing them into these soldiers.</p><p>At this moment, within the various branch altars, the altar masters and guardians find themselves in a sort of 'trance'.</p><p>In this 'trance', they're on a battlefield engulfed in rain, each possessing a thunderous avatar, capable of experiencing the battlefield's carnage and the enemy’s pressure, as if they were truly present.</p><p>They seem to have become one with the thunder soldiers, remotely commanding them in battle.</p><p>This was a novel experience.  Previously, they could only assist Qin Sang in wielding the thunder talismans through the altar; this was the first time they felt truly immersed in the battle, truly understanding the nature of the battlefield and the terrifying might of the enemy.</p><p>Upon joining the fray, they were immediately overwhelmed by the intensity of the conflict.  Even though they weren't sure if the deaths of the thunder soldiers would affect them, they felt immense tension.</p><p>After all, they were merely strands of consciousness projected onto the battlefield, still requiring the leadership of their general, even among the other cultivators directly engaged in combat.</p><p>Countless thunder soldiers formed vast battle formations, with Gui Hou and the others at their very center, safely protected within their physical bodies.</p><p>A surging torrent of thunder power poured in, transforming the formations and generating strength far surpassing their individual cultivation levels.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A deafening roar echoed.</p><p>The thunder soldiers transformed into massive, black rivers, charging towards the enemy lines with overwhelming force, shaking the very earth and causing the void to tremble.</p><p>The two sides clashed instantly.</p><p>It appeared that only Gui Hou and his companions were directly engaged, but in reality, the full power of the Storm Realm was behind them.</p><p>Although the enemy possessed several experts at the Nascent Soul stage, the thunder soldiers remained fearless. Even when facing defeat, they had one final resort – self-destruction!</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>In an instant, countless flashes of thunder illuminated the battlefield, like the most brilliant fireworks, displaying a tragically beautiful light.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang charged into the fray.</p><p>Throughout the battle, Qin Sang's physical cultivation techniques were largely revealed, including repeated use of the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, upon his arrival, he immediately drew the enemy's strongest fighters to him.</p><p>Unwavering, he unleashed both the Great Vajra Wheel Seal and the Sun Wheel Seal, backed by the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunder Rain Technique.  Even when surrounded, he maintained a domineering presence.</p><p>Seizing an opportunity, Qin Sang again summoned the Five Elements Crown, unleashing two alternating beams of Five Elements light.</p><p>The cultivator targeted by the Five Elements Crown had no time to react.</p><p>Over the course of the battle, the Five Elements Crown proved highly effective. While it failed to kill anyone, the companion beasts struck by the Five Elements light were either killed or severely injured, instilling considerable fear in the Lu Wang forces.</p><p>This cultivator possessed a delicate appearance, wearing fine silks—appearing almost feminine.</p><p>The cultivators, through brainstorming, finally devised a countermeasure. Their goal this time was to lure out the Five Elements light, requiring someone to serve as bait.</p><p>This time, the bait was the silk-clad cultivator.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Five Elements light struck swiftly.</p><p>The others halted their attacks, each summoning a token.</p><p>The tokens were crimson, wider at the top than the bottom, resembling arrowheads, encircled by flames, leaving a long trail of fire as they moved.</p><p>The flames danced, all tokens pointed squarely at the silk-clad cultivator, their light dazzling.</p><p>At the moment the Five Elements light struck the silk-clad cultivator, a ring of flame erupted in front of them, forming a protective circle.  Through the flames, it was apparent that the cultivator, though not completely immobilized, had visibly twisted at the moment of impact, yet still failed to completely evade the reverse Five Elements light.  At the critical moment, Lu Gan intervened, a flash of Xuanhuang light saving the cultivator.</p><p>Seeing this, the cultivators’ eyes lit up.  The tokens were crafted by the Grand Protector himself, specifically to counter the Five Elements Crown.  While they hadn't saved the cultivator, it offered a glimmer of hope.</p><p>As they continued their probing attacks, Qin Sang's understanding of the Unfixed Eight Extremes Diagram deepened.  He felt a distinct resistance when the silk-clad cultivator escaped; a moment slower, and they would have almost certainly perished.</p><p>Therefore, an item capable of countering the Five Elements Crown was crucial.</p><p>This item still had room for improvement.  Having achieved their goal, the cultivators called out to each other and began an orderly retreat.</p><p>The battlefield gradually calmed, the thunder soldiers transforming back into raindrops, the storm ceaseless.</p><p>…</p><p>East of the Demon Sea.</p><p>An isolated island sat upon the sea.  While small, it possessed exceptionally abundant spiritual energy.  Cultivators perpetually guarded this island, their duty being to monitor changes in the Foul Lands.</p><p>The island’s proximity to the Foul Lands presented risks of beast attacks and threats from the Changyou tribe.</p><p>Despite these dangers, the assignment remained highly sought-after. The island housed a grand formation personally laid by the Glass Fairy, capable of concealing the island’s location; thus, no incidents had occurred in recent years. The post only required monitoring the Foul Lands, did not involve direct combat, and did not interfere with cultivation – a highly desirable position.</p><p>A stone hall and three separate caves had been built on the small island, allowing three cultivators to share the duty and take turns in seclusion.</p><p>In the stone hall, a cultivator in a brocade robe sat before a mirror-like disc.</p><p>A robed cultivator sat cross-legged, hands resting on his knees, constantly changing hand seals while studying a spell.  He occasionally glanced at a mirror-like disc.</p><p>The disc reflected the scene within the Foul Lands: black, swirling mists raged, a spectacular and terrifying sight. This had been going on for nearly a century, only changing during the ebb.</p><p>Lost in his spell, the cultivator didn’t notice the gradual shift in the reflection.</p><p>The mists slowed, their collisions lessened, until they appeared to solidify, forming distinct walls of stagnant fog.</p><p>Then, in an instant, the stillness broke.  The mists exploded in a cataclysmic eruption, a tidal wave of fog bursting forth.</p><p>The cultivator, sensing something, looked up, his gaze hardening. He rushed to the disc.</p><p>The explosion was followed by a rapid contraction. The mists recoiled, as if a century’s worth of pent-up energy had suddenly released, retreating wildly to reveal the ocean surface hidden beneath.</p><p>Then another eruption, the mists reclaiming lost ground.  This cycle repeated endlessly.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Three figures burst into the hall.</p><p>The robed cultivator bowed to an elder, saying, “Master Bai.”</p><p>This was his first time stationed here; unsure if this was a sign of the ebb, he anxiously watched the elder.</p><p>Master Bai stared intently at the disc, then threw back his head and laughed, “The foul miasma is finally receding! Quickly, report this to the sect!”</p><p>His excitement was understandable.  According to tradition, he stood to receive a portion of the Azure Spirit Qi!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The robed cultivator and the other two immediately set up an array.  All were disciples of the Xuan Tian Palace, and swiftly transmitted the news back to the Palace.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The protective mountain array activated, clouds obscuring the sky, masking the phenomena occurring at the main altar.</p><p>Currently, Qingyang Temple's experts were stationed at various branch temples, leaving few at the mountain gate.</p><p>A streak of light approached from the west, drawing closer to the protective array without slowing.</p><p>A young acolyte flew out of the clouds, shouting, "Who goes there?"</p><p>The light paused slightly, revealing a figure.</p><p>Recognizing the person, the acolyte hastily bowed, "Junior greets Master Shi!"</p><p>Shi Xue nodded, "I have urgent matters to report to Grand Master Qin."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The acolyte hesitated, then heard a transmitted voice, "Let her in."</p><p>Recognizing his master's voice, the acolyte relaxed, bowing, "Master Shi, please enter!"</p><p>On the altar, Qin Sang's Dharma body looked towards the mountain gate, curious about Shi Xue's urgent business.</p><p>Upon entering Qingyang Temple, Shi Xue saw the altar, towering majestically to the heavens.  Suppressing her shock, she flew upwards, saying, "The foul miasma shows signs of receding!"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  It was indeed time for the ebb, according to the cycle, but it was earlier than in previous years.</p><p>"Has Liuli not returned?" Qin Sang guessed the reason for Shi Xue's personal visit.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Shi Xue shook her head, a worried expression flitting across her face.  "My junior sister hasn't been seen. Is she alright?"</p><p>Before leaving, Liuli had said she wouldn't miss the Azure Spirit Qi competition.  Without her, it would be difficult to contend with the Changyou tribe in the Storm Realm.</p><p>She should have returned six months ago; her silence caused great concern.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. Since learning of Liuli's mysterious 'master', he'd been more at ease, but now, uncertainty crept in.</p><p>"With Liuli's intelligence, her safety isn't a concern. She may be delayed by other matters," Qin Sang reassured.</p><p>Optimistically,  Liuli might not know that Minzhuo's clan leader had broken through. She might have found an opportunity to advance herself and concluded that focusing on her breakthrough was preferable, even if it meant missing the Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>"Let's hope so…"</p><p>Shi Xue suppressed her anxiety, asking, "Should we still compete for the Azure Spirit Qi?"</p><p>The timing is unfortunate; enemy forces are at the border, and the Storm Realm's experts are stretched thin. Sending a small force would certainly be no match for the Changyou tribe.</p><p>The Azure Spirit Qi versus survival—the priorities were clear. She knew they should likely abandon the competition this time.</p><p>…</p><p>Western Lands.</p><p>In a mountain, stone caves had been carved into a cliff face as dwellings for the Minzhuo and Changyou cultivators.</p><p>In one cave, a Changyou elder was meditating when his wrist flashed.  He immediately awoke, received incoming information, and rushed towards the cave closest to the summit, activating a restriction.</p><p>"Enter!"</p><p>Inside, Minzhuo, the clan leader, was recovering from minor injuries sustained during a previous raid.</p><p>The elder hurried in.</p><p>Minzhuo asked, "What is it?"</p>
