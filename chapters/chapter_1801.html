<h1>Chapter 1792: Plundering Heaven and Earth to Empower Oneself</h1><p>A Spiritwood body finally revealed!</p><p>Amidst the towering ancient trees, Qin Sang didn't appear small.</p><p>As he pushed himself off the ground, the surrounding wood spirit energy, drawn by the Spiritwood body, surged towards him, condensing into tangible emerald green masses. With Qin Sang at the center, a swirling vortex formed, ceaselessly rotating.</p><p>The aura of the Spiritwood body merged with the jungle.</p><p>As the wood spirit energy revolved, it continuously poured into the Spiritwood body, devoured by Qin Sang.</p><p>In an instant, his previously waning vitality rapidly recovered.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Li Hou's expression changed, shock filling his eyes. He finally understood why Qin Sang hadn't fled, choosing instead to face him here.</p><p>Plundering Heaven and Earth to empower oneself.</p><p>Directly drawing power not inherently one's own from between Heaven and Earth, supplementing one's deficiencies – this was a divine ability possessed only by Grand True Masters of the Five Talismans rank and kings among the妖 race!</p><p>Among Profound Cave True Masters and 妖 Marquis, only those with heaven-defying talent, or whose cultivation had reached the absolute peak and had spent years honing their skills, might be able to touch the threshold, grasping a sliver of this power.</p><p>Looking across the Dao Court and the Ghostfang Kingdom, such figures were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, each a pinnacle expert.</p><p>This man, a mere early Profound Cave cultivator, had actually comprehended such a heaven-defying divine ability!</p><p>After a brief moment of shock, Li Hou regained his composure, not intimidated by Qin Sang.</p><p>This divine ability didn't belong to a Profound Cave True Master. Forcibly using it wouldn't be without a price.</p><p>The simplest point being, absorbing external forces into one's body without refinement, even if it could be forcibly utilized, would inevitably have hidden dangers, causing internal chaos, and even impacting one's Dao Foundation.</p><p>If it exceeded the limits of what one could withstand, the physical body could collapse on the spot.</p><p>Even among Profound Cave cultivators, pinnacle experts deeply versed in this wouldn't dare use it recklessly. Their capacity for endurance had limits.</p><p>Li Hou's guess was correct.</p><p>In fact, the *Postnatal Wooden Figure Stele* did indeed possess many hidden dangers and limitations.</p><p>This secret technique could only draw wood spirit energy from plants. In other environments, many of its abilities were restricted, the Spiritwood body at most serving to strengthen Qin Sang's physical body.</p><p>Wood spirit energy carried vigorous life force. Utilizing precious spiritual plants of the world as mediums weakened the destructive effects on the practitioner, making it barely usable by late Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>However, absorbing wood spirit energy still placed a heavy burden on the cultivator. Back then, even if Qin Sang hadn't burned down the Ice Instrument Palace, the strange-faced man would only have dared to carefully absorb a small amount of wood spirit energy, slowly replenishing himself.</p><p>Unfortunately, Li Hou didn't know that Qin Sang's medium was the Dao Manifestation Tree, which surpassed even the legendary Ten Great Divine Trees.</p><p>Qin Sang also felt the pressure, but it wasn't yet enough to become a burden, meaning he could maintain this state for a longer time!</p><p>"Unless you destroy this entire jungle, this humble Daoist is invincible. Does Li Hou still wish to fight to the death?"</p><p>An astonishing aura erupted from Qin Sang.</p><p>Here, the jungle and the earth were real, yet not an ordinary jungle.</p><p>The areas ravaged by their previous battle already sprouted saplings, growing at an alarming rate.</p><p>This wasn't the Ice Instrument Palace. Even if Li Hou's innate divine ability was powerful enough to transform the entire space into a mire, it couldn't destroy the jungle.</p><p>The wood spirit energy was practically boundless.</p><p>However, these words, in Li Hou's ears, sounded somewhat forced. He sneered, "This Marquis has indeed underestimated you! However, how many times can you use this?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed sharply. He thrust his long arms forward, his withered, branch-like hands overlapping. A surge of formidable force erupted, the void cracking like thunder, a gale swirling like a dragon, carrying an unstoppable momentum as it surged outwards.</p><p>A resounding boom echoed as a badger's shadow appeared within the gale, its slender claws extended, meeting Qin Sang's palm in a clash across the void.</p><p>They didn't make physical contact. The fluctuations caused by the collision exploded between them. With them as the epicenter, the surrounding vegetation was uprooted, turning into dust in mid-air, the earth cracking beneath.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing he'd made his point, resolved not to fight Li Hou to the death. He retracted his palm and retreated.</p><p>Li Hou didn't pursue closely. His eyes narrowed slightly. From that blow, he clearly felt Qin Sang had grown stronger. The Spiritwood body not only helped him recover but also enhanced his combat prowess.</p><p>With its powerful defensive capabilities, the peculiar Spiritwood body, and unique escape techniques and combat instincts, a Profound Cave Marquis in the early stage likely wouldn't be his match.</p><p>Outside this space, unless he was certain this man was alone, Li Hou wouldn't want to provoke such a troublesome opponent.</p><p>However, this wasn't enough to make Li Hou retreat.</p><p>He believed Qin Sang's current state couldn't last. Glancing at the sky wall, he could still see a faint gold mixed with the green, indicating the golden light hadn't yet faded.</p><p>This man clearly wanted to use this divine ability to stall for time, but it was futile. Until the golden light receded, he could only pray a human cultivator happened to pass by.</p><p>Using the Spiritwood body meant he had trapped himself in this jungle space, with nowhere to go.</p><p>Li Hou could simply continue to engage him, using his superior cultivation to wear him down.</p><p>In Li Hou's view, no matter how strong the Spiritwood body was, it was just a living target, while he remained free to advance or retreat.</p><p>In a flash, Li Hou closed in on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang, transformed into the Spiritwood body, appeared cumbersome, but was surprisingly agile, his arms moving like dragons, wide and powerful.</p><p>Compared to Qin Sang, Li Hou's body seemed smaller, his figure like the wind, constantly flickering around Qin Sang, each attack incredibly precise and cunning.</p><p>Looking down from above, one would see a giant, ancient tree sprinting across the ground, pursued by a small, squirrel-like creature, their sizes vastly different, yet the small creature relentlessly chased the tree.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Each collision shook the entire jungle.</p><p>Qin Sang, using the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal* with the Spiritwood body, exhibited even greater power. Even when occasionally grazed by Li Hou's sharp claws, he would do his best to avoid vital areas. Immersed in wood spirit energy, his bark-like skin rapidly closed, quickly returning to normal.</p><p>*Poof!*</p><p>An ancient tree instantly withered. Qin Sang just leaped from its trunk when a dark shadow burst from the ground.</p><p>Li Hou pursued relentlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang hastily leaped away, evading the attack.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang, using the Spiritwood body's ability to leap between ancient trees, could temporarily shake off Li Hou.</p><p>After a few attempts, Li Hou found a counter-strategy. Burrowing underground, he could accurately judge Qin Sang's movements, emerging through earth遁, clinging to him relentlessly.</p><p>However, because Qin Sang constantly evaded direct combat, his energy depletion was far slower than Li Hou anticipated.</p><p>He snorted, eyes widening, his pupils turning black, as if a whirlwind spun within their depths.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The ancient trees on the ground suddenly grew wildly.</p><p>Closer inspection revealed that it wasn't the trees growing taller, but the entire ground rising, creating a floating peak in the void.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The ground disintegrated into countless clods of earth.</p><p>Simultaneously, a fierce wind rose in the sky. This wasn't an ordinary wind. As it blew across the clods, they instantly merged, transforming into a mass of black clouds, violently churning high in the sky, emitting a muffled thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, seeing black orbs forming within the dark clouds. Although he didn't know what they were, he instinctively sensed danger and charged outwards with all his might.</p><p>But the dark clouds moved incredibly fast, always hovering above him.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>As the orbs fully formed, they shot down from the clouds. In an instant, over a dozen head-sized orbs hurtled towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Within the deep, dark orbs, wind and thunder seemed to clash, radiating an extremely violent aura.</p><p>Meanwhile, Li Hou's true form continued to circle Qin Sang, keeping him constantly on the move.</p><p>With this sudden change, alarm bells rang in Qin Sang's mind. He abruptly stopped, desperately thrusting out a palm, both seals appearing. With a bang, he blocked the fatal claw aimed at his throat, simultaneously using Thunder Escape to move sideways.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the orbs, as if drawn to him, pursued relentlessly. Qin Sang, unable to dodge, hastily raised his fists to block.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A dark light bloomed before Qin Sang's fist, instantly erupting with thunder, exploding into streaks of black lightning.</p><p>Now it was clear. The orbs seemed to be thunder orbs.</p><p>A sneer appeared on Li Hou's face. This was the Xun Earth Demon Thunder he'd comprehended from his bloodline divine ability. Its power was formidable, and once locked onto a target, it was almost impossible to dodge, forcing a direct confrontation.</p><p>From then on, the dark clouds firmly locked onto Qin Sang.</p><p>One could see the dark clouds pursuing the tree spirit like tribulation clouds, countless thunder orbs raining down continuously.</p><p>Qin Sang not only had to defend against the elusive Li Hou but also withstand the constant bombardment of the Xun Earth Demon Thunder. His sprinting figure stumbled and swayed, appearing extremely狼狈.</p><p>This was precisely what Li Hou wanted to see.</p><p>Faced with Li Hou's relentless pressure, Qin Sang continuously used the Spiritwood body's abilities to flash between ancient trees, but with little effect. The Xun Earth Demon Thunder wouldn't stop until it hit its target, making dodging futile.</p><p>He had no choice but to activate his protective divine abilities and endure.</p><p>Qin Sang drew wood spirit energy from the jungle, recovering quickly, but also depleting it rapidly.</p><p>Before long, Li Hou, who had been observing Qin Sang, saw a slight change in him.</p><p>The momentum of his wood spirit energy absorption wasn't as grand as before, and his recovery speed had slowed!</p><p>His speculation was confirmed.</p><p>Li Hou roared with laughter. His figure flickered, donning stone armor, transforming into a stone beast comparable in size to Qin Sang, and, like Qin Sang, planted his feet firmly on the ground.</p><p>A world-shaking battle ensued.</p><p>If mortals witnessed this, they would surely believe it was two giant beasts locked in a desperate struggle. Two Nascent Divinity experts had actually begun a purely physical brawl, striking each other with such force that the earth cracked.</p><p>It wasn't truly a brawl. Li Hou's relentless pressure left little room for maneuver. Divine abilities were shattered before their manifestations could fully form, resulting in this seemingly primal display.</p><p>Smoke and dust billowed, leaves whirled wildly.</p><p>Dark clouds hung overhead, thunder orbs continuously raining down on the battlefield, amplifying the spectacle.</p><p>Li Hou, unaffected by his own Xun Earth Demon Thunder, attacked recklessly, his fists striking Qin Sang with such force that even the stone armor on his arms crumbled.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not relax, lest he lose focus. He could only leap between the ancient trees to escape the perilous situations.</p><p>But Li Hou gave him no time to breathe. As soon as the ancient tree he chose showed signs of withering, the nearby ground would rise, the stone beast following like a shadow.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang's movements became more labored, the restorative effects of the wood spirit energy diminishing, the decline becoming increasingly evident with time.</p><p>Just as Li Hou predicted.</p><p>The more wood spirit energy he absorbed, the greater the impact on his body, resulting in overall weakening.</p><p>His absorption rate slowed, the restorative effects lessened.</p><p>Furthermore, as the pressure continued to build, Qin Sang's foundation was shaken, his Qi and blood circulation disrupted, his strength diminishing.</p><p>Li Hou watched coldly, like observing a trapped beast making its last desperate struggle. He seemed patient, taking his time, waiting for Qin Sang to weaken to the extreme before delivering the fatal blow.</p><p>However, this was just a facade.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Five thunder orbs shot out in rapid succession.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, skillfully employing his Shifting Art.</p><p>A distant ancient tree instantly turned yellow, its withered leaves rustling down, its life force drained.</p><p>Qin Sang leaped from the cracked trunk, a massive shadow immediately appearing before him, lunging towards him.</p><p>He wasn't surprised. Stepping on a lotus flower, he formed seals to meet the attack.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the anticipated collision didn't occur. As the stone beast reached Qin Sang, its chest suddenly split open, a transparent spike shooting towards him.</p><p>Li Hou's true form emerged from the crack, a sneer on his face.</p><p>Waiting until the opponent was weakened to strike ensured success. He understood this, and Qin Sang undoubtedly did as well.</p><p>If Qin Sang had any tricks left, he would save them for that moment, for a desperate last stand.</p><p>Qin Sang was a Profound Cave True Master. Li Hou didn't intend to experience the power of his desperate strike. He chose to do the opposite, striking at the moment Qin Sang least expected it, when his guard was down.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The spike was incredibly fast, appearing before Qin Sang in an instant, about to pierce through him.</p><p>At the critical moment, Qin Sang forcibly twisted his body, a green light flashing as a suit of armor suddenly appeared.</p><p>The armor was merely a magical treasure, with no other special properties.</p><p>But the moment the spike struck the armor, it seemed to encounter immense resistance, stopping in mid-air.</p><p>Where the spike pointed, the armor melted into water, yet this gentle flow stopped it.</p><p>Li Hou's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>妖 cultivators would choose a part of their body and continuously refine it, turning it into their equivalent of a natal magic treasure.</p><p>He usually used his claws, leading other 妖 Marquis to believe he had chosen them.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, his claws were a disguise. His true refined treasure was this spike.</p><p>The spike was formed from the hyoid bone in his mouth. After countless years of refinement, its power was extraordinary.</p><p>When he joined this 妖 King's forces, he had sparred with the King's first Marquis.</p><p>At the time, he was only at the early Profound Cave stage, yet he injured the first Marquis with his bone spike, gaining notoriety and the 妖 King's favor.</p><p>Now, the bone spike was even stronger, his most powerful killing move, yet it couldn't even pierce a suit of armor!</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill run down his spine. He had to admit, the bone spike was terrifying.</p><p>Fortunately, Li Hou had encountered him. First, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly accurately captured the spike's trajectory, then the True Treasure fragment firmly blocked it.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The spike flew back.</p><p>Li Hou couldn't help but examine it, confirming it was his familiar bone spike. His expression completely changed.</p><p>Suddenly, Li Hou transformed into a streak of black light, shooting towards the sky, abandoning his weakening prey without hesitation.</p><p>If the opponent hadn't intended to fight, why hadn't he shown his true strength from the beginning?</p><p>Seeing so many powerful divine abilities and treasures would surely give him pause before attacking.</p><p>Clearly, the opponent had other motives!</p><p>Recalling Qin Sang's previous actions…</p><p>Better safe than sorry!</p><p>Before Li Hou could escape, a shout rang out, "Thinking of leaving now? Isn't it a little too late?"</p>
