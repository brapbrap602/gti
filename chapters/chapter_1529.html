<h1>Chapter 1520  Remembering Sui</h1><p>Chapter 1520  Remembering Sui</p><p>“They say that when the Grand Master established the Qingyang Temple, wise men from the North Star region gathered, and Yuan Ying masters assembled.  With a single sword strike, the Grand Master leveled the cliff face, leaving no tremors, no dust, astonishing everyone, earning their unquestioning respect, and becoming a legendary tale…”</p><p>Tan Yi’en gestured towards the large characters carved into the cliff face, extravagantly praising Qin Sang’s achievements.  Establishing the sect was only one part of it.</p><p>His words ignited a fervent passion in the young disciples, filling them with the utmost reverence for the mysterious Grand Master.  Tan Yi’en observed this with a pleased nod, a subtle smile playing on his lips, his eyes filled with expectation.</p><p>Qin Sang left everything to him.</p><p>Li Yu’fu, Mei Gu, Shangguan Lifeng, and the others were all devoted to their cultivation, either in seclusion or traveling to seek breakthroughs. Unless it was a matter of major decisions, they rarely interfered with Tan Yi’en.</p><p>Tan Yi’en had complete freedom within the sect.</p><p>He shifted his gaze from the disciples to the breathtaking scenery of the Qingyang Temple—a vibrant display of life and growth.  The Temple's success was also due to his efforts!  Becoming the leading sect in Xiaohan region, even the entire North Star region, was just a matter of time.</p><p>At this thought, Tan Yi’en felt invigorated, thoroughly enjoying the feeling.</p><p>“Let's take them to the mountainside lodgings first…”</p><p>Tan Yi’en turned to a young man beside him.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a red cloud suddenly soared into the mountain gate.  This was Bai Hanqiu’s flying artifact, personally refined by Qin Sang, its speed rivaling that of a magical treasure, unique to the Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Tan Yi’en smiled, “Hanqiu’s back… hm?  Who’s this?”</p><p>The red cloud descended before Tan Yi’en, revealing Bai Hanqiu and an elegantly dressed youth.  Bai Hanqiu had shed her youthful naivety, now radiating elegance and sophistication.</p><p>The youth was handsome, clad in silk brocade with a jade pendant at his waist; despite his young age, he possessed a certain regal bearing, suggesting noble lineage.  Facing the legendary cultivator, the youth’s fists were clenched, slightly stiff, yet his eyes did not waver, bravely meeting Tan Yi’en’s assessing gaze.  This was, of course, also because Tan Yi’en had not unleashed the aura of a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu, though not a high-level cultivator, held a significant position in the Qingyang Temple as Qin Sang's disciple. The youth's identity must be…</p><p>Tan Yi’en looked inquiringly at Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu nodded, saying in a low voice, “This child's name is Qin Nian Sui. He is a descendant of the Qin family's collateral branch, and his bloodline has been verified… He has three spiritual roots!”</p><p>The Qin family, the imperial family, had branched out extensively over centuries, growing into a massive clan with countless collateral branches. Qin Nian Sui was the only member of the collateral branches to possess spiritual roots.</p><p>“The Qin family!  Three spiritual roots!”</p><p>Tan Yi’en took a deep breath, overjoyed.  “The Grand Master finally has a successor!”</p><p>The two exchanged messages about how to arrange for Qin Nian Sui, even considering whether to alert Li Yu’fu and others to discuss who should take him as a disciple.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>A faint ripple appeared at the mountain gate, unnoticed by the disciples on guard. Then, two figures materialized out of thin air beside Tan Yi’en and Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>Tan Yi’en was the first to notice the anomaly, his face paling with shock, but then turning to joy. He bowed, “Disciple greets the Grand Master…”</p><p>Mid-bow, Tan Yi’en saw the person behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Tan Hao made no attempt to conceal his cultivation; his gaze held a gentle warmth.</p><p>“Father…”</p><p>Tan Yi’en froze, speechless, his eyes wide. He knew Qin Sang would go to the North Sea to search for his father, but he never expected it to be so soon, nor that his father had become a Yuan Ying master!</p><p>Bai Hanqiu, unfamiliar with Tan Hao, bowed respectfully to Qin Sang, greeting her master.</p><p>But someone was faster.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, whose appearance mirrored the portrait of their ancestor, Qin Nian Sui immediately knelt, knocking his head on the ground, his voice clear, “Unworthy descendant Qin Nian Sui greets the ancestor!”</p><p>“Nian Sui…”</p><p>Looking at the young Qin clan member, Qin Sang inexplicably recalled his time searching for the immortal path in the Great Sui dynasty when he first arrived in this world.</p><p>Qin Nian Sui, unsure of the situation, dared not raise his head, explaining, “My original name was Qin Yaowu. Before I left, His Majesty bestowed the name Nian Sui upon me.”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled inwardly.</p><p>The current emperor was likely a distant descendant of Qin Sanwa.</p><p>He had little personal connection to the Qin family's descendants. Elevating them to the imperial family was merely a way to repay the body he currently inhabited.</p><p>Now, the Qin family had produced a disciple with cultivation talent—a three-spiritual-root disciple—a new beginning.</p><p>He considered his efforts complete.</p><p>Qin Sang told the young man waiting nearby, "Take him and his disciples to the quarters for training."</p><p>"Yes, Master," the young man replied, glancing at Qin Nian Sui before leading the group away.</p><p>Disappointment flickered in Qin Nian Sui's eyes, but he quickly regained his composure, believing it to be an ancestral test.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured for Bai Han Qiu to follow, wanting to avoid interrupting the father-son reunion.</p><p>Bai Han Qiu, unsure of Qin Sang's intentions, hesitated before asking, "Master, regarding Nian Sui's future..."</p><p>"No special treatment," Qin Sang said calmly.  "At Qingyang Temple, he is just a regular disciple.  The temple offers several lineages; let him choose. We shall observe his character and see how he develops."</p><p>Bai Han Qiu, blushing slightly, mumbled an affirmation, swallowing the words he had been about to speak.</p><p>"Send word to Yu Fu and all disciples at the Foundation Establishment stage or higher to return to the mountain.  I will announce an important matter in a month," Qin Sang commanded before leaving Qingyang Temple and flying towards Da Sui.</p><p>His journey began at the place where he had awakened after being released from prison. Following the Wu Ling River downstream, he reached the old ferry crossing and ascended Cui Ming Mountain.</p><p>The old Qingyang Temple remained unchanged on Cui Ming Mountain.  A large new Daoist temple had been built halfway down the mountain.</p><p>Legend had it that more than one immortal had resided on Cui Ming Mountain; thus, the place was bustling with pilgrims.</p><p>Bai Jiang Lan, Shui Houzi, Ji Xin Dao Ren, Ming Yue...  These familiar names now felt somewhat distant. Cultivators possess exceptional memories, but over time, less significant recollections fade, only resurfacing when emotionally triggered.</p><p>After a brief stay on Cui Ming Mountain, Qin Sang entered San Wu City, now renamed Qingyang City. The descendants of the baozi shop owner were still there, running the same business, though the taste had changed.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, continuing north along his old campaign route, pausing occasionally until he reached the capital.  He didn't visit the Qin family descendants in the palace but climbed Mount Chao Sheng alone.</p><p>Mount Chao Sheng had become a true sacred site, guarded by people appointed by Tan Yi En.  Even the Da Sui Emperor was forbidden to enter without permission.</p><p>The mountain was tranquil. The Empress's tomb was an off-limits zone. Qin Sang walked slowly, paused briefly, then opened the seal he had placed there, revealing the unmarked stele.</p>
