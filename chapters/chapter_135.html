<h1>Chapter 128 I’ll Do It</h1><p>Chapter 128 I’ll Do It</p><p>(Happy double festival to all!)</p><p>"If the other party branded your true soul during the cultivation, there will be endless hidden dangers. Zhenren Mo Wu would definitely not do such a thing. There will only be a few strands of affection after dual cultivation, which will then bind your true soul. Together with the loss of your vitality, it will indeed affect your future progress. It will be more difficult for you to reach the Core Formation or Nascent Soul stage than others. But you will still be you. And your sect will compensate you in other ways."</p><p>Having finished speaking, not waiting for the Gong surname cultivator to open his mouth, Elder Yu's lips moved slightly, silently saying a few words.</p><p>The Gong surname cultivator's expression faltered, a hint of hesitation appearing in his eyes. He suddenly lowered his head and lapsed into silence. It seemed like he had been moved.</p><p>Another elderly man bowed, asking with a hoarse voice, "Martial Brother Sect Leader, if I agree to cultivate this technique, would it benefit my descendants?"</p><p>Elder Yu returned the bow, solemnly saying, "Martial Brother Zhao, if you leave behind descendants, our sect will definitely look after them..."</p><p>He also transmitted a message, and the elder nodded his head, but did not directly respond.</p><p>At this moment, He Mu, who had been standing still at the side, even when the Gong surname cultivator revealed the secret of cultivation, suddenly opened his mouth without showing any emotion on his face, "I report to the Sect Leader, I have looked through the entire 《Mysterious Yin Jade Cauldron Scripture》, it seems like us Qi Refining stage disciples will find it difficult to cultivate to the third layer. I wonder if my knowledge is too shallow, unable to understand the mysteries of the technique?"</p><p>Elder Yu smiled at Qin Sang and the other two, saying, "You are correct. The three of you will indeed encounter a bottleneck when solidifying the jade cauldron after cultivating to the third layer. And this secret technique requires that those who dual cultivate are at least at the Foundation Establishment stage. For this reason, whoever solidifies the jade cauldron first, the sect will help them with all their might to advance to the Foundation Establishment stage. This is one of our compensations. We will also grant one of your requests."</p><p>The great hall was momentarily silent. Everyone understood that the Sect Leader's conditions were indeed very sincere. Otherwise, there would be no need for such trouble.</p><p>Jian Wen suddenly straightened his body, standing straight with his shoulders back. He raised his head and sonorously said, "Please forgive me, Sect Leader. My heart is set on the Great Path. I am confident in forging a Golden Core with my own strength. It would be dishonorable to be a furnace."</p><p>The Gong surname cultivator inhaled deeply, indignantly sweeping his sleeves, decisively saying, "Gong would rather die than help others cultivate a cultivation technique!"</p><p>Elder Yu nodded his head. He was not angry nor did he try to force him. He only looked at the others.</p><p>"I'll do it!"</p><p>"I'll do it!"</p><p>Suddenly, two people said in unison. One was He Mu, the other was Qin Sang.</p><p>Hearing that the sect would help them raise their cultivation to the Foundation Establishment stage for free, Qin Sang did not hesitate at all.</p><p>So what if their Qi Sea was a bit smaller? Wouldn't a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator still be a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator?</p><p>The worst that could happen was he wouldn't confront other Foundation Establishment stage cultivators. The Ten Palaces閻羅 Array and the Ebony Wood Sword could make up for the difference.</p><p>As for the Core Formation or Nascent Soul stage, they were completely out of Qin Sang's reach. All he could do was occasionally fantasize about them. He could only take each step forward.</p><p>As long as he broke through to the Foundation Establishment stage, his lifespan would increase by over a hundred years. Then, everything would be possible!</p><p>What surprised him was that He Mu made his decision so quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at He Mu out of the corner of his eyes. It seemed like He Mu's face would never show any expressions. He stared at Elder Yu, but his eyes were filled with yearning.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang sighed involuntarily.</p><p>If he was in He Mu's situation, trying every possible method but still unable to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, he would definitely make the same choice, even without the help of the Jade Buddha.</p><p>The Zhao surname cultivator hesitated for a moment before saying, "Martial Brother Sect Leader, I'm willing to give it a try."</p><p>The other two Foundation Establishment stage cultivators looked at each other, transmitting messages to Elder Yu and agreeing to it in the end.</p><p>After the Gong surname cultivator and Jian Wen left, Qin Sang and the other four followed Elder Yu out of the great hall. They flew to the rear of Mount Shaohua, arriving in front of a row of cave abodes at the back of the mountain. Each of them chose one and brought the 《Mysterious Yin Jade Cauldron Scripture》 in to cultivate.</p><p>After closing the cave abode, Qin Sang thought to himself. From the way Elder Yu spoke, it seemed like only one of the five of them was qualified to be the furnace; that is to say, whoever cultivated the 《Mysterious Yin Jade Cauldron Scripture》 to the third layer first and solidified the jade cauldron.</p><p>They even had to fight for who could be the furnace. Qin Sang sighed, taking out the jade scroll to carefully comprehend this technique.</p><p>The first layer seemed very simple. After giving up on the 《Ghost Scripture》 and switching to cultivating this technique, as his cultivation increased, the vitality in his body would condense into a jade liquid. There were no bottlenecks. Like switching to other techniques, he only needed to cultivate step by step.</p><p>The reality was the same. Qin Sang only spent a month to cultivate to the first layer.</p><p>The second layer could form the embryo of the jade cauldron, accumulating the jade liquid.</p><p>Having cultivated to this point, Qin Sang had some understanding.</p><p>In truth, from the moment he started cultivating the 《Mysterious Yin Jade Cauldron Scripture》, he was a furnace.</p><p>However, the Jade Tripod was not yet perfect, and the Core Vitality Jade Liquid only formed a thin layer. If harvested at this time, even the fragile Jade Tripod formed at the second stage of cultivation would collapse easily, causing the loss of the Core Yang and leaving the Core Vitality empty and fully exhausted. Even the Nine Yang Pill could not save the cultivator from becoming a real waste pill, utterly reduced to a cripple.</p><p>To perform the harvest at this time would be no different from fishing in an empty pond. The benefits gained by the one performing the harvest would not be as much as at the third stage.</p><p>After Qin Sang cultivated the second stage of the [Jade Tripod of Heaven and Earth Scripture], his divine consciousness reached out to the jade slip and glimpsed all the hidden secrets of the third stage of the technique. This knowledge revealed that when cultivating the third stage, the cultivator would be constantly influenced by the Heavenly Demonic Heart’s Desire. It was only then that he understood why it was necessary to undergo a selection in the Gourd Phantasm first.</p><p>The Heavenly Demonic Heart’s Desire tempted one’s spirit, creating desires within the heart. This was one’s most genuine desires, and it was not any different from the Demonic Heart.</p><p>If one’s mind was not resolute, they would be led astray by the Heavenly Demonic Heart’s Desire and unable to extricate themselves from it. There was absolutely no way they could complete the cultivation of the third stage.</p><p>Holding the jade slip, Qin Sang read for a long time, and he always felt like the technique of the third stage was not complete, like someone had deleted a part of it, but the entire process of cultivation was still complete.</p><p>Putting aside his distracting thoughts, Qin Sang focused on studying the technique in the jade slip, imprinting it deeply into his mind, then he settled his mind and began his cultivation.</p><p>The Mortal World Phantasm, the Heavenly Demon’s Temptation.</p><p>As soon as he began to cultivate, Qin Sang fell into the Heavenly Demon’s Phantasm, where his demonic thoughts proliferated. His eyes beheld a scene of chaos, surrounded by an endless chorus of lewd and lascivious sounds, while a strange fragrance enticed the deepest desires and passions within his heart.</p><p>If it had been someone else, even if they could maintain their original intentions inside the Heavenly Demon’s Phantasm and persevere for a while, they would have had to stop and stabilize their mind, casting off the influence of the phantasm.</p><p>Otherwise, once a flaw appeared in their state of mind, it would be irreversible.</p><p>However, just as it had been inside the Gourd Phantasm, Qin Sang’s mind remained extremely clear. He simply viewed these provocations as a beautiful skeleton, and they failed to mislead him.</p><p>For this reason, Qin Sang had no need to worry about the influence of the Heavenly Demonic Heart’s Desire at all. He cultivated day and night without pause, and the Jade Tripod within his body consolidated and took shape at an astonishing pace, and the Jade Liquid gradually filled it to the brim.</p>
