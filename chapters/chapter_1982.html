<h1>Chapter 1973: Entering the Game</h1><p>The border of Xuan Kingdom.</p><p>A million soldiers stood in a stalemate.</p><p>The armies on both sides stretched out for dozens of miles, their camps and fortifications forming a vast network.</p><p>Soldiers were as numerous as ants, tents like a forest.</p><p>After countless battles, the land before the two armies was soaked in blood. The blood seeped into the earth, staining it a dark crimson down to three feet.  The number of fallen soldiers was beyond counting, a horrifying sight.</p><p>As the morning sun rose, the battlefield was already filled with the thunderous roar of battle cries.</p><p>Within the Yan Kingdom's encampment, a hill offered a panoramic view of the warzone, and it was here that the command tent was erected.</p><p>Before the command tent, Yulang and several generals stood by the railing, facing east. The blood-red glow of dawn bathed them.</p><p>Everyone's expression was grave as they gazed at the heart of the battlefield.</p><p>Years of military life had tempered Yulang, replacing some of his scholarly elegance with an aura of hardened steel.</p><p>Watching the soldiers locked in fierce combat, worry gnawed at him. He inadvertently glanced south.</p><p>Not far to the south, a towering peak rose, even higher than the hill beneath their feet, offering a superior vantage point.  It was one of the highest points on the battlefield.</p><p>However, mortals were forbidden to ascend that mountain.</p><p>Everyone knew that it was an Immortal Mountain.  A newly constructed palace stood upon it, serving as the abode of Immortal Masters.</p><p>Even on some stone platforms and sheer cliffs, one could glimpse the silhouettes of meditating Immortal Masters.</p><p>Shrouded in mist, their figures appeared and disappeared, exuding an otherworldly air.</p><p>Whenever the soldiers looked upon this mountain, their faces filled with reverence.</p><p>A similar location existed within the enemy's ranks.</p><p>Yulang's concern was not that their side's cultivators were inferior to the enemy's. On the contrary, they had emerged victorious in most of the dozens of battles fought.</p><p>What truly troubled him were the mounting casualties and the seemingly endless carnage.</p><p>The battlefield in between was like a demonic abyss, devouring countless lives, insatiable even after being flooded with blood.</p><p>Over the years, Yulang had witnessed so much death that he had become numb to it. Yet, at this moment, he felt an overwhelming pang of sorrow.</p><p>In his view, many of these deaths were meaningless.</p><p>The involvement of cultivators, instead of hastening the war's end, had only intensified the bloodshed.</p><p>If there were no cultivators present, he was confident he could stake everything on a decisive blow, crushing the enemy army in one fell swoop, instead of this interminable entanglement.</p><p>In truth, he hadn't expected to remain in his position as commander-in-chief for so long.</p><p>He had assumed that with the intervention of cultivators, the conflict would inevitably transform into a struggle between them.</p><p>On the battlefield, cultivator casualties were unavoidable. Casualties bred hatred, escalating from individuals to sects, eventually culminating in a confrontation between righteous and demonic forces.  Both sides would call upon allies, and grudges and alliances would become tangled like a messy web, drawing in more and more people and factions.</p><p>Most conflicts evolved in this manner.</p><p>Once Nascent Soul cultivators entered the fray, who would care about mortals?</p><p>When the mighty figures of both sides determined a victor, the mundane world would naturally follow suit, falling under the control of the winner.</p><p>Reality, however, had defied his expectations.</p><p>Both the righteous and demonic sides exercised remarkable restraint. Aside from the Nascent Soul Grand Ancestors who oversaw the armies and intimidated their opponents, no Golden Core or higher-level cultivators had appeared on the battlefield.</p><p>Even when cultivators perished in battle, the individuals dispatched from their sects to seek revenge never exceeded the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>If this could be maintained indefinitely, it would be acceptable.</p><p>As fellow Foundation Establishment cultivators, these individuals, bound by their sect's orders, would not openly defy his commands as commander-in-chief.</p><p>Yulang had meticulously planned and managed to gradually push back the enemy forces, bringing them to the brink of a final decisive battle.</p><p>Yet, with the arrival of this decisive battle, powerful figures had sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain.</p><p>Yulang was now uncertain how many Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators were present on the mountain.</p><p>These powerful figures were not merely observers; they had also brought 'treasures.'</p><p>At this moment, a faint crimson mist permeated the battlefield, accompanied by the rhythmic clang of gongs.</p><p>Three thousand soldiers stood on each side.</p><p>The crimson mist emanated from the Blood Essence Banners held by the Yan Kingdom soldiers.</p><p>The gong sounds originated from the bronze gongs wielded by the enemy.</p><p>The enemy had formed a semi-circular formation, with a Foundation Establishment cultivator at the rear holding a large, gleaming golden gong. Five hundred soldiers, each wielding a palm-sized bronze gong, surrounded him.</p><p>The sound of gongs filled the air.</p><p>These soldiers, focused solely on beating their gongs, were clearly outnumbered in the actual fighting.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the gong sounds possessed a peculiar power. Rings of light pulsed outwards, falling upon their comrades at the front lines.</p><p>Their allies' morale surged, their bodies radiating a bronze glow, as if forged from iron. They faced the dragon-shaped blood energy coalesced by the Blood Essence Banners without flinching.</p><p>Conversely, the Yan Kingdom's side was affected by the gong sounds, their formation wavering.</p><p>Previous battles had followed a similar pattern.</p><p>The defeated side, three thousand elite soldiers, were either slaughtered or captured, while the cultivators often managed to escape.</p><p>Both sides provided various treasures and spells, yet the outcome was determined by the flesh and blood of mortals, using countless lives as fodder.</p><p>Yulang was unaware of any agreement between the righteous and demonic factions. He only knew that if this continued, more and more people would die in vain.</p><p>"It's like this again!"</p><p>A large chessboard divided into smaller boards; even the smallest board had its players and pieces.</p><p>Regardless of the game, mortals were merely pawns, manipulated at will.</p><p>This was what Yulang abhorred!</p><p>He had believed he could change things, but now he only felt powerless.</p><p>His role as commander-in-chief was not merely symbolic; the deployment of troops was his responsibility. Yet, after each battle, regardless of victory or defeat, Yulang felt only sorrow.</p><p>"Can Master change this situation?"</p><p>Yulang gazed at the clear sky, lost in thought.</p><p>In his heart, his Master was omnipotent.  He hadn't encountered danger yet, so he unhesitatingly used one of his bamboo slips for his conviction.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A furious roar suddenly erupted on the battlefield.</p><p>The roar came from the Yan Kingdom soldiers, resembling the dragon's roar of the dragon-shaped blood energy. It boomed like thunder, shaking the very soul.</p><p>The gong sounds faltered momentarily under the impact of the roar, and the Yan Kingdom forces seized the fleeting opportunity, surging forward and shattering the enemy formation.</p><p>'Clang! Clang! Clang!'</p><p>The cultivator desperately beat the gong, but seeing his side's increasing disarray and inability to regroup, he immediately abandoned his soldiers, transforming into a streak of light and fleeing.</p><p>He dared not linger, for if he were caught by the dragon-shaped blood energy, his chances of survival would be slim.</p><p>The Yan Kingdom forces returned victorious, their faces beaming with joy.</p><p>A flicker of sorrow crossed Yulang's eyes.  He sighed inwardly, then caught sight of a figure in his peripheral vision.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>He suddenly saw his Master, whom he hadn't seen in so long.</p><p>In this instant, a mix of joy and sorrow overwhelmed Yulang.</p><p>He suddenly wondered if it would have been better if he, like his Senior Sister, had chosen to return to the peaceful Qingyang Temple.</p><p>"You've done well," Qin Sang surveyed the battlefield, his praise genuine.</p><p>These words were not empty flattery. Yulang's ability to become commander-in-chief had truly exceeded Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that his disciple had done his best.</p><p>Most commendable was that despite the trials and tribulations he had faced, Yulang's original aspirations remained unchanged.</p><p>Although Yulang's aspirations differed from his own, Qin Sang felt a sense of pride for his disciple.</p><p>"Master..."</p><p>Yulang's eyes blurred slightly, a torrent of emotions surging within him.</p><p>It stemmed from his Master's affirmation, but also from his experiences over the years.</p><p>Just then, the defeated enemy dispatched another wave of troops onto the battlefield, issuing their challenge.</p><p>From afar, one could see that all the soldiers wore wooden armor. The wood was of an unknown type, and branches with green leaves actually sprouted from some parts of the armor.</p><p>Once these soldiers formed their ranks, they seemed rooted to the earth, as steady as a rock, unmoved by any force.</p><p>"General Qin, please instruct us, whom should we send to face them!"</p><p>"Yuan Qing of Yulong Mountain requests to fight!"</p><p>...</p><p>Roaring challenges echoed from the Yan Kingdom camp.</p><p>Yulang looked at his Master.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, and a gentle breeze swept toward the enemy formation.  A series of cracking sounds immediately arose.</p><p>The three thousand soldiers were horrified to discover cracks appearing in their armor, turning it into fragments that fell away from their bodies.</p><p>The sensation of being rooted to the earth vanished, and they felt themselves become lighter, flying backwards and tumbling like gourds, their screams filling the air.</p><p>"Who dares to act so presumptuously!"</p><p>"Who is it!"</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang's action instantly drew furious shouts, some even emanating from the southern mountain.</p><p>In the next moment, figures shot out from the mountain.</p><p>The sky above the battlefield suddenly filled with hundreds of individuals, primarily Golden Core cultivators, but also a number of Nascent Soul Grand Ancestors with profound auras.</p><p>All eyes focused on this scene.</p><p>Yulang's heart trembled, but beside his Master, he felt a sense of reassurance, devoid of fear.</p><p>"Who are you!"</p><p>A middle-aged man stepped forward from the opposing side.</p><p>He had ordinary features, a pale complexion, and a thin frame, resembling someone recovering from a serious illness.</p><p>Yet, the others regarded him with respect, making way for him.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng?"</p><p>A surprised voice rang out from the south.  Someone had recognized Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over and saw Yin Heqian.  He nodded in acknowledgment, then turned to the middle-aged man, rising into the air with a smile.  "Clearly, powerful figures from both sides are present, yet you waste time like this. How long will it take to determine a victor? This Daoist lacks patience and has grown weary of waiting. Which fellow Daoist will step forward for a battle?"</p><p>The middle-aged man frowned, looking at the Kuang family's Grand Ancestor, his gaze seeming to inquire about the situation.</p><p>The Kuang family's Grand Ancestor summoned Yin Heqian to his side and, after a brief inquiry, mused, "So this is General Qin's Master, Daoist Qingfeng?  Indeed, he possesses an extraordinary demeanor..."</p><p>He flashed towards Qin Sang's side, cupping his hands.  "This humble one is Kuang Wujiang. Greetings, Daoist."</p><p>"Greetings, Fellow Daoist Kuang."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang wasn't arrogant, the Kuang family's Grand Ancestor's expression softened slightly. He gestured towards the southern mountain. "Unaware of your arrival, Daoist, we've failed to welcome you properly. We've brought some spiritual tea and immortal wine from our sect. Would you honor us with your presence?"</p><p>"Not yet!"</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand. "We shall drink tea after capturing these demonic scoundrels."</p><p>"This..."</p><p>The Kuang family's Grand Ancestor frowned.</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously, "What troubles you, Fellow Daoist Kuang?  Or is it that among these demonic cultivators, there exists someone with unparalleled demonic arts, making you hesitant to engage?"</p><p>Upon hearing these words, the Kuang family's Grand Ancestor couldn't help but feel a surge of anger. Suppressing his fury, he said, "Please, Daoist, grace us with your presence on the southern mountain, and this old man will explain everything."</p><p>"There's no need for such trouble. Even if there exists an unparalleled demonic master, this Daoist will still meet them and experience their demonic arts!  Since none of you wish to come forth, this Daoist will go to you!"</p><p>The last sentence was directed at the opposing side.</p><p>Before his voice faded, a sword beam shot out from Qin Sang's sleeve. It wasn't the Gray Warbler Sword, but a random spiritual sword he had taken.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The sword hummed brightly. Before anyone could react, it hurtled towards the middle-aged man's head.</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>The middle-aged man's heart jolted.  Enraged, he slapped his waist, and a grayish-white thin rope flew out.</p><p>The rope was crystalline, resembling a long tendon.  It wasn't made of ox or dragon tendon, but woven from human tendons, known as the Soul Tendon.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Soul Tendon snapped forward, whistling through the air, emitting mournful cries like the wailing of countless resentful spirits, chilling the heart.</p><p>The Soul Tendon was about to wrap around the spiritual sword.</p><p>Without any visible movement from Qin Sang, the sword beam trembled, abruptly splitting into ten, and then continued to divide.  In the blink of an eye, it became impossible to count how many sword beams there were.</p><p>The middle-aged man felt a momentary disorientation, finding himself surrounded by sword beams, omnipresent.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Alarmed, the middle-aged man hastily recalled the Soul Tendon, but it was too late. All the sword beams vanished from his sight.</p><p>He knew that the sword beams hadn't disappeared; he simply couldn't see them.</p><p>There was only one possibility: he had fallen into a sword formation!</p><p>This formation was the璇玑剑阵 (Xuánjī Sword Formation) that Qin Sang had learned at the Formless Immortal Sect, specializing in illusory swordsmanship.</p><p>Trapped within the sword formation in a single exchange.</p><p>The others stared, dumbfounded.</p><p>The middle-aged man was a peak expert at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, reputed to be the strongest cultivator below the late-Nascent Soul stage, yet he wasn't even a match for a single strike.</p><p>Just what was the origin of this Daoist Qingfeng?</p><p>"Big Brother!"</p><p>A young man cried out in alarm, hastily summoning a demonic saber, slashing it towards Qin Sang's head.</p><p>The saber's edge was infinitely sharp.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless, glancing at the Kuang family's Grand Ancestor. "Fellow Daoist, are you still not going to act?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>The Kuang family's Grand Ancestor was momentarily unsure of what to do.</p><p>The conflict between the righteous and demonic paths had nothing to do with Cloud Metropolis Heaven or the Fallen Soul Abyss. They were merely compelled to participate due to the overwhelming power of these two forces.</p><p>No one wanted to fight to the death for the two forces' struggle, so they had made a gentleman's agreement to decide the outcome using mortals as pawns.</p><p>This way, they could also avoid excessive casualties.</p><p>Of course, this was predicated on the satisfaction of the two major forces.  Otherwise, they would have to personally enter the fray.</p><p>This was also a way to test the two forces' attitudes.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a disruptor had appeared.</p><p>Daoist Qingfeng was clearly on their side.  The Kuang family's Grand Ancestor couldn't stand idly by and watch him be attacked without intervening.  He had no choice but to summon his spiritual sword to block the demonic saber.</p><p>A playful smile appeared on Qin Sang's face as he rapidly changed his sword hand seals.</p><p>To everyone's eyes, the interior of the sword formation was a chaotic blur, and no one knew what was happening inside.  Then, the sword light suddenly converged and shot back.</p><p>Within the sword light, a figure was wrapped.</p><p>The middle-aged man's eyes were wide with shock, having lost all ability to resist, reduced to a captive!</p><p>A wave of commotion erupted.</p><p>The righteous side was also stunned. Only after hearing Qin Sang's bellow, "What are you waiting for?", did they hesitantly charge forward.</p><p>A chaotic battle erupted unexpectedly.</p><p>Soon, streaks of light converged from all directions, their auras even stronger than the middle-aged man's. They were all late-Nascent Soul experts, sect Grand Ancestors, who were enraged upon seeing the situation spiral out of control.</p><p>Then, a shocking scene unfolded.  The demonic cultivators were no match for Daoist Qingfeng, falling in defeat one after another.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered in the air, gazing towards a mountain hundreds of miles away.</p><p>On the mountain, Immortal Yun and the cloaked figure watched this scene unfold, their expressions stiff.</p><p>Since they were so eager to draw him into their game, he would show them what he was capable of!</p><p>Not just this time; Qin Sang intended to disrupt the entire game, until he forced the two Soul Formation Grand Ancestors to emerge!</p>
