<h1>Chapter 2012: Jade Blade</h1><p>Seeing that Qin Sang didn't mind Steward Luo's impertinent words, Attendant Ruan wisely shut his mouth and looked at Steward Luo.</p><p>Steward Luo appeared calm, but was actually extremely nervous.  The other party was not only a Transcendence Stage cultivator but also an elder of the Five Elements League, a position of high status and not to be offended. He wouldn't have been so insistent if it hadn't been absolutely necessary.</p><p>Relaxing slightly, Steward Luo hurriedly took out a purple stone.  "Senior, if you can remove the impurities from this Purple Origin Stone and refine the purest Purple Heaven God Iron, that will be sufficient proof."</p><p>Seeing the stone in Steward Luo's hand, Qin Sang was somewhat surprised.</p><p>Purple Heaven God Iron was a precious spiritual material, and he certainly knew of it, but he had never heard of this Purple Origin Stone.  The Five Elements League's records made no mention of it.</p><p>According to the records, Purple Heaven God Iron exists in the Great Thousand World in the form of crystals.  Usually, as long as a vein is discovered, the purest Purple Heaven God Iron can be obtained. However, Purple Heaven God Iron has a troublesome characteristic: these crystals are independent, and it's extremely difficult to smelt them into a single piece of Purple Heaven God Iron.  Crystalline Purple Heaven God Iron cannot be directly used for refining weapons.</p><p>"Where did you obtain this Purple Origin Stone?"</p><p>Qin Sang took the stone into his palm, his divine sense penetrating its interior. He immediately made a new discovery.  The Purple Origin Stone was far less pure than the Purple Heaven God Iron crystals, but the Purple Heaven God Iron refined from it could be formed into a solid piece, eliminating the need for smelting.</p><p>"The Purple Origin Stone is said to come from a region within the Savage Lands, formed into a vein due to a special environment.  Unless there are other similar environments elsewhere, only that place produces Purple Origin Stone," Steward Luo replied.</p><p>"The Savage Lands?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Steward Luo. No wonder even the Five Elements League hadn't recorded it.</p><p>What kind of background did the Steward Luo's master family have to possess treasures from the Savage Lands?  Could it be from the chaotic region between Da Zhou and the Savage Lands?</p><p>Within a few breaths, Qin Sang had grasped the characteristics of the Purple Origin Stone. Refining Purple Heaven God Iron from it wasn't particularly difficult; the key was the amount of loss during the refining process and how much pure Purple Heaven God Iron could be extracted. This would reveal the refiner's skill.</p><p>Especially for someone encountering Purple Origin Stone for the first time, only those with deep experience in the Dao of Refinement could minimize waste. It was a clever test.</p><p>Qin Sang stood still, eyes closed, holding the Purple Origin Stone, ready to refine it on the spot.</p><p>Seeing this, Attendant Ruan quietly activated the courtyard's formation, pulling Steward Luo aside to silently watch Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>True Qi gradually gathered in Qin Sang's palm. A visible mist enveloped the Purple Origin Stone.</p><p>The Purple Origin Stone tumbled within the mist.</p><p>Refining the Purple Origin Stone didn't require fire; pure True Qi could accomplish it. This required both powerful cultivation, precisely controlling every change within the Purple Origin Stone, and relying on past experience to meticulously analyze the Purple Origin Stone, extracting the Purple Heaven God Iron layer by layer without contamination from impurities.</p><p>Attendant Ruan and Steward Luo held their breath, watching as streams of foul air escaped from the mist. The Purple Origin Stone gradually shrank, its luster becoming increasingly pure, causing them to reveal expressions of awe.</p><p>Finally, the fist-sized Purple Origin Stone was reduced to the size of a fingernail, like a piece of the purest purple crystal, radiating purple light.</p><p>"Elder Qin's skills are divine; I am in awe!"</p><p>Steward Luo stepped forward, his demeanor becoming even more respectful.  "This piece of Purple Heaven God Iron is a gift from my master to Elder Qin. Please wait a moment, Elder Qin. I will return and invite my master to come personally. However, my master was recently injured and is using secret techniques to heal. If there is any disrespect, I hope Elder Qin will forgive me."</p><p>With that, Steward Luo bowed and withdrew.  Shortly after, he personally arrived at the Five Elements League gate in a carriage.</p><p>The carriage was pulled by a strange spirit horse.  Various unique spirit beasts were commonplace in Jade Gate Pass, and it didn't attract attention. Only those with sufficiently keen spiritual senses vaguely noticed that the spirit horse and carriage had a unique aura. Just as they were about to observe closely, the carriage had already been ushered in by Attendant Ruan.</p><p>The carriage entered Qin Sang's courtyard. Steward Luo lightly landed, standing beside the carriage, whispering, "Young Master, this is Elder Qin of the Five Elements League."</p><p>Then, Qin Sang, who was sitting in the courtyard playing with the Purple Cloud Divine Iron, bowed and was about to speak when the carriage curtain trembled slightly.</p><p>"My surname is Xin, and my given name is Sheng. I greet Elder Qin. Due to illness, I was forced to use a family secret technique, resulting in inconvenience and a strange appearance. I dare not show myself openly, and I apologize for any rudeness."</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the carriage.</p><p>The carriage faced him, separated only by a thin curtain. It seemed that he could see inside through the gaps, but he could only sense a vague aura and couldn't determine the cultivation level of this young master Xin.</p><p>The other party's voice was very hoarse, indeed lacking in breath, whether genuine or feigned, he couldn't tell.</p><p>The spirit horses pulling the carriage were clearly illusions, indicating that the carriage was a magical artifact capable of shielding the spiritual perception of a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang did not use his divine sense to forcibly break through; otherwise, it might not be able to stop him.  But doing so would make a peaceful discussion impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't completely believe the other party's words.  The actions of Manager Luo and Young Master Xin gave Qin Sang the feeling that they were deliberately hiding something; their identities might not be genuine, were they evading some enemy?</p><p>However, it was extremely rare to ask a master refiner to refine treasures at the Fengju Jade Gate.  Qin Sang had long anticipated that there might be some involvement behind the request.</p><p>He always valued practicality over empty formalities, and since the other party's words were fairly earnest, he didn't probe further. He placed the Purple Cloud Divine Iron on the table, sat down, and said calmly, "You've seen my skills.  Since Young Master Xin has come in person, you must have sincerity. Let's get down to business."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Young Master Xin paused, seemingly organizing his thoughts.  "This matter is of great importance. Before reaching our destination, we cannot reveal the exact location. We can only tell Elder Qin that it's a small thousand world within the Fengju Jade Gate..."</p><p>...</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>An unremarkable carriage left the Jade Gate, gradually swallowed by the wind and sand.</p><p>On the city walls, several ambiguous, ill-intentioned gazes followed the carriage intently.</p><p>As soon as the carriage disappeared into the sandstorm, several figures darted out, attempting to follow.</p><p>However, after chasing for a while, the carriage vanished without a trace.  These individuals from different factions were left staring at each other in the desolate desert, having lost their target.</p><p>"Elder Qin, should we deal with those fellows?"</p><p>On a hill, Qin Sang, already outside the city, stood with a dozen people behind him.</p><p>Among the dozen or so people, some were Transformation Stage cultivators, and others were Nascent Soul Stage cultivators. All were fierce-looking, exuding a strong murderous aura—members of the Hengsha Society.</p><p>Within the Fengju Jade Gate, the danger level varied depending on location.  Nascent Soul cultivators could explore the outer regions alone, but deeper exploration required a Transformation Stage cultivator to lead the way.</p><p>Six were Transformation Stage cultivators. The speaker was their leader, Qu Zhen, a late Transformation Stage cultivator. The Nascent Soul cultivators were also capable and represented a formidable force anywhere.</p><p>"No need," Qin Sang looked up at the sky.</p><p>A dragon-phoenix chariot was approaching rapidly through the air.</p><p>Leaving the Jade Gate, the carriage finally revealed its true power.  The spirit horses were replaced by eight dragon-phoenixes—four dragons and four phoenixes, extraordinary and divine. The carriage's structure had also changed. In addition to Young Master Xin's private chamber, a spacious hall supported by more than a dozen dragon-phoenix stone pillars appeared, with outer纱帐帷幔 (sha zhang wei man -  curtains and drapes) and jade tables inside, laden with exquisite fruits and drinks.</p><p>"Elder Qin, fellow Daoists, please come aboard. The treasure carriage will make the journey easier," Young Master Xin invited.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stand on ceremony and boarded the dragon-phoenix chariot with Qu Zhen and the others, each finding a seat at a jade table.</p><p>The dragon-phoenix chariot shuddered and took off. Qin Sang's gaze instantly sharpened, focusing on the north.</p><p>Deep within the sandstorm, a green rainbow streaked across the sky at high speed—a sword cultivator who seemed to have sensed Qin Sang's presence. The rainbow paused slightly but didn't approach, quickly resuming its speed towards the Jade Gate.</p><p>Qu Zhen and the others only sensed a fleeting sharp sword intent in the distance but didn't notice the subtle changes. Qin Sang secretly observed Manager Luo, who remained calm and enthusiastically greeted Qu Zhen and the others, seemingly oblivious.</p><p>If Young Master Xin were also a Void Refinement cultivator, he would surely have noticed the sword cultivator's actions.</p><p>Up to this point, Qin Sang had only met two members of the Xin family.</p><p>"Didn't Young Master Xin say that the other members of the Xin family were stationed outside the city? When will they arrive to join us?" Qin Sang asked, looking around.</p><p>"It would be too conspicuous for them all to enter the city; they'd easily be noticed by those with ulterior motives.  Therefore, they're hidden outside the city and will arrive at the Fengju Jade Gate in batches. Manager Luo has already sent talismans and will definitely arrive before we enter. Elder Qin, rest assured, once we're inside the Fengju Jade Gate, I'll immediately order them to follow your instructions and help you find the Dihua Jade Vine," Young Master Xin explained.</p><p>This is one of the conditions of cooperation between the two parties.  In addition, Qin Sang also requested that the other party share information about the Fengju Jade Gate with him; other compensation is yet to be determined.</p><p>As for the conditions for employing the Hengsha Society, it is to re-refine a treasure for Qu Zhen and others. The degree of refinement will depend on their contribution.</p><p>Eight dragon and phoenix illusions pulled the carriage with great effort, and the carriage sped through the wind and sand towards the northwest.</p><p>They flew for more than ten days without stopping, discovering several towns of varying sizes along the way.</p><p>That evening, while speeding along, Qu Zhen stepped forward and said, "Elder Qin, ahead is Huisha Town. I know an informant who lives here. If anything major happens at the Fengju Jade Gate, this person always gets the news first."</p><p>"Let Steward Luo accompany you down," Qin Sang instructed.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The two received their orders and got off the carriage. The carriage waited in the air.  Two hours later, they returned and recounted the information they had gathered.</p><p>The Fengju Jade Gate remained unchanged; nothing noteworthy had occurred, so they could proceed without worry.</p><p>Approaching the Fengju Jade Gate, Qin Sang subtly felt the void of heaven and earth constantly vibrating, even affecting people's minds.</p><p>The wind and sand intensified, and occasional surges of spiritual energy could be seen roaring past.</p><p>The Fengju Jade Gate is exceptionally vast.  Entering from certain locations is important. The dragon and phoenix carriage continued north, clearly indicating that the Xin family's destination was further north.</p><p>However, it is said that the Fengju Jade Gate borders the Witch Clan to the west and the Wilds to the north. Even flying for another ten days, they wouldn't reach the northernmost point of the Fengju Jade Gate; instead, they might encounter danger and perish along the way.</p><p>On the twentieth day, Qin Sang, who was closing his eyes and resting in the carriage, suddenly changed expression, abruptly straightening up as if he had sensed something unusual. He stared intently northward, his eyes flashing with brilliance.</p><p>Everyone in the carriage immediately noticed Qin Sang's unusual behavior. Following his gaze, however, they only saw boundless yellow sand, their hearts tightening, fearing danger approaching.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, escaping the carriage and instantly disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The reins on the dragon and phoenix tightened suddenly. Young Master Xin stopped the carriage.</p><p>At this moment, everyone faintly sensed several auras in the north, chasing each other. It seemed like a group of people were pursuing another group, and the highest cultivation level among them was only at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. A female cultivator whispered, "Could one of Elder Qin's descendants be among those being pursued?"</p><p>This wasn't the first time they'd encountered a fight; Elder Qin had never interfered before.</p><p>Qu Zhen shook his head and signaled for all Nascent Soul cultivators to fly over.</p><p>Steward Luo hesitated.  "Young Master, we…"</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Young Master Xin uttered a single word.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>Three figures were chasing each other in the wind and sand. It appeared that two were jointly pursuing one.</p><p>All three were Nascent Soul cultivators. The pursuers were two men in black robes. The person being chased was disheveled and injured.</p><p>This person was a woman, a jade sword whirling around her, incredibly nimble, repeatedly deflecting the attacks.</p><p>The woman was frantic. The cultivation of each pursuer surpassed hers. If not for her jade sword, she would have already fallen; now, she was trapped and had no chance of escape, destined to be exhausted and killed.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>An ice arrow was deflected by the jade sword, shattering into pieces.</p><p>One of the black-robed men was unconcerned, instead showing greed. "Unexpectedly, there's a bonus this time. A mere early Nascent Soul cultivator, yet possessing a jade sword about to transform into a spiritual treasure!"</p><p>"Once we seize this sword, we brothers will soon also have a spiritual treasure," the other licked his lips, revealing a lecherous look.  "The little girl is not bad either; a top-grade cauldron.  Too bad there's only one; we brothers will have to take turns enjoying her!"</p><p>"Hahaha…"</p><p>The two laughed unrestrainedly, attempting to break the woman's spirit.</p><p>Neither of them noticed a figure appearing silently before them.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the woman, or rather, at the jade sword beside her.</p><p>Although the jade sword was drastically different from before, it was forged by his hand, still retaining a familiar aura within its blade.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand, and the jade sword suddenly detached from the woman, flying towards him.</p><p>The woman also saw Qin Sang, realizing the jade sword was completely beyond her control. Her blood almost froze, and her eyes filled with terror.</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked the jade sword, as if communicating with an old friend, or reminiscing about the past.  Looking at the terrified woman, he softly asked, "Ice Han, the Sect Leader of the Xu Ling Sect, what is your relation to her?"</p>
