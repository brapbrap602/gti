<h1>Chapter 649: Bloodbone Pill</h1><p>Steward Bai nodded and handed Qin Sang a jade slip. “Fellow Daoist asked me to gather information on prominent figures who have emerged in the surrounding regions over the past two centuries. This wasn't difficult. I asked friends from all sides for help and collected quite a bit of information recently. Are you looking for someone? Providing more details might make the search easier.”</p><p>Qin Sang took the jade slip and examined it. Countless names were recorded within. Although the Western Frontier was barren, it still had its share of talented individuals. Many powerful figures had emerged over the past two centuries, their deeds widely known.  Their achievements were recorded in the jade slip.</p><p>Hearing Steward Bai's words, Qin Sang raised his eyelids slightly and said, “No need to trouble yourself, Steward Bai. My cultivation has plateaued, and I don't want to remain confined in my cave. I've decided to travel and gather some information beforehand, so as to avoid inadvertently offending someone I shouldn't.”</p><p>This time, Qin Sang didn't mention Qing Zhu by name.  He now realized the location of the ancient teleportation formation was deeply hidden.  Perhaps, when Qing Zhu arrived in the Western Frontier, he, too, concealed his identity and discreetly searched for the formation. If he failed, he would have undoubtedly left the Western Frontier and returned to human territory. Remaining in the Wu Divine Continent wasn't a long-term solution.</p><p>He had asked Steward Bai to gather information on influential figures, holding onto a sliver of hope that he might find clues within their stories.</p><p>Steward Bai laughed heartily. “Fellow Daoist worries too much. These powerful figures only dominate the Western Frontier temporarily.  After achieving a certain level of cultivation, unless they have deep ties to their sect or believe their path to immortality is hopeless, most don't choose to remain in the Western Frontier.  They either travel beyond the Western Frontier, even outside the Wu Divine Continent, or they go to the Stormy Demon Sea to hunt demons.”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. “I've heard that the only way to the Stormy Demon Sea is through Mount Wu Divine, using the teleportation formation?”</p><p>Steward Bai nodded. “The Stormy Demon Sea lies beyond the Canglang Sea. No one knows its exact location within the endless storms. We can only reach the few islands occupied by our two races in the Demon Sea through the teleportation formation. I'm not familiar with the human teleportation formation, but the Wu Clan's are all located on Mount Wu Divine, jointly managed by the major sects. By Mount Wu Divine, I mean our sacred mountain. As long as you pay enough spirit stones, anyone, regardless of cultivation level or identity, even humans, can use it.”</p><p>Steward Bai glanced at Qin Sang. “Did someone persuade you to hunt demons in the Stormy Demon Sea? Take my advice, that place is incredibly dangerous, teeming with countless demonic beasts. Our two races can only barely maintain a foothold by occupying a few islands, which are frequently attacked by beast tides. Whether humans hunt demons or demons hunt humans, it's uncertain in the Stormy Demon Sea. Countless Core Formation experts have perished there, let alone Foundation Establishment cultivators like us. If you need Bloodbone Pills, just buy them with spirit stones. There’s no need to risk your life in such a place.”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. “Are you trying to persuade me to buy Bloodbone Pills from you?”</p><p>The Wu Clan was deeply versed in insect control and had created many spirit pills to aid the growth and even transformation of spirit insects. The most famous was the Bloodbone Pill.  These pills were refined from the blood essence and bones of demonic beasts. Feeding them to one's lifebound insect蛊 could increase its chances of transformation. The higher the demon beast's level, the more effective the pill.</p><p>It was said that top-grade Bloodbone Pills were even refined with demon cores that still retained some spirituality!</p><p>For the Wu Clan, the Bloodbone Pill was similar to the Foundation Establishment Pill and Core Formation aids that were familiar to cultivators in the Small Cold Region.</p><p>Although the Canglang Sea was resource-poor, the presence of the Stormy Demon Sea meant an abundance of demonic beasts, a number unimaginable to Small Cold Region cultivators. Demonic beasts were their cultivation resources. The Wu Clan had found an alternative path by creating the Bloodbone Pill.</p><p>However, despite its effectiveness, the Bloodbone Pill couldn't be given to insect蛊 in excess. Lifebound insect蛊, also known as blood蛊, were fed with blood essence. The more blood a blood蛊 consumed, the more it would be influenced by fierce energy, becoming increasingly ferocious and violent, prone to devouring its master.  </p><p>Bloodbone Pills, refined from demon bones, blood, and even demon cores, were even more potent in this aspect. After consuming them, insect蛊 were easily influenced by this fierce energy, increasing the risk of devouring their masters, a risk that even the Wu Clan's natural talents couldn't completely suppress.</p><p>After learning about the Bloodbone Pill, Qin Sang initially thought he could use it to directly push his lifebound insect蛊 to the third transformation.</p><p>Later, after making inquiries, he realized he couldn't recklessly feed Bloodbone Pills to his insect蛊. He wasn't afraid of backlash, but if his lifebound insect蛊 was controlled by fierce energy, it would become extremely frenzied, lose all sentience, and might even self-destruct.  Such a lifebound insect蛊 would be of no help to its master.</p><p>Steward Bai nodded nonchalantly and leaned closer, speaking mysteriously, “As long as you have enough spirit stones, I can even get you top-grade Bloodbone Pills. But the price…”</p><p>Steward Bai paused, giving Qin Sang a meaningful look.</p><p>Qin Sang understood.  He had searched far and wide in the Small Cold Region for demon cores to refine his Flying Night Devil, so he knew the value of such items.  While there were more demons in the Canglang Sea than in the Small Cold Region, hunting Demon Core realm demons was just as difficult. The price of demon cores remained high, and the cost of top-grade Bloodbone Pills could be imagined.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade slip, engaging in perfunctory conversation with Steward Bai while pondering when to depart for the Stormy Demon Sea.  Ever since cultivating the “Spirit Refinement Sword Mantra,” Qin Sang was destined for a life intertwined with killing. While others feared the Stormy Demon Sea, he had to go there to comprehend the Killing Rune.</p><p>After reaching Core Formation, Qin Sang had spent months in the Western Frontier searching for the ancient teleportation formation and resources for his lifebound insect蛊, but his cultivation hadn't progressed because he lacked the trials of killing.</p><p>The Stormy Demon Sea was inevitable.</p><p>“I hope Cui Xuanzi and the others can surprise me,” Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Before leaving, he had instructed Cui Xuanzi and the others to organize the cultivators under his command and search the Bear Mountain region for thousands of miles to help him find the ancient teleportation formation. Of course, he understood the formation’s importance and didn’t mention it to anyone, only instructing them to search for secret realms.</p><p>If they still couldn’t find the formation, Qin Sang would have to set it aside temporarily and focus on his own cultivation, finding another way when he was stronger.</p><p>However, Qin Sang knew little about Mount Wu Divine. He was considering whether to go directly to the Stormy Demon Sea from Mount Wu Divine or first visit human territory, experience its customs, and then proceed to the Stormy Demon Sea.  He had heard that within the Stormy Demon Sea, human and Wu Clan cultivators had to join forces to survive, setting aside their differences and cooperating sincerely under the pressure from the demonic beasts.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang put away the jade slip.  None of the individuals within matched Qing Zhu.</p><p>“How many of the spirit insects I requested have you found?”</p><p>Steward Bai shook his head. “After you left, I carefully examined the list of spirit insects you gave me and realized they all have exceptional potential. Clearly, Fellow Daoist has great ambitions! However, these spirit insects are rare and difficult to capture. They aren't commonly seen in the Western Frontier…”</p>
