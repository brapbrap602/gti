<h1>Chapter 1549: A Visit</h1><p>Time flew like an arrow.</p><p>Fifty years passed in a flash.</p><p>Within the Clear Void Illusion Realm, a certain area remained perpetually shrouded in mist.  Aside from Qin Sang's avatar entering once every ten years or so, no one else went in or out.</p><p>Including Xie Qian and Xie An, the disciples of the Xie Clan, while curious about this mysterious place during their cultivation within the Clear Void Illusion Realm, only dared to steal a glance or two.  They didn't dare to overstep their bounds in the slightest, walking respectfully along the forest paths toward the wooden houses prepared for them.</p><p>Undisturbed in his secluded cultivation, Qin Sang's true body's cultivation steadily increased.</p><p>From his advancement to mid-Nascent Soul stage to this closed-door cultivation, excluding the thirty-seven years in the Storm Zone, there were still several decades in between.  Whenever he had time, Qin Sang would seize every second to cultivate.  However, his energy was often diverted by various matters, hindering his ability to focus entirely on cultivation, resulting in less significant progress.</p><p>Compared to before, the benefits from refining the Buddha Bone Shard were evident.</p><p>Traveling thousands of miles to Central Continent was definitely worthwhile.</p><p>During his closed-door cultivation, Qin Sang encountered almost no major obstacles that would stall him for decades.  Even when faced with bottlenecks, he only needed to patiently contemplate for a period, or temporarily switch from his main cultivation method to cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus," changing his mindset. When he returned to his main method, he would be able to break through smoothly.</p><p>Without unforeseen circumstances, in another thirty or forty years, his cultivation would reach the peak of mid-Nascent Soul stage, allowing him to begin preparations for the next breakthrough.</p><p>This was thanks to the seven Sword Talismans of his Life-Bound Spirit Sword and the Cleansing Spirit Pool.</p><p>All things considered, the actual time spent in quiet cultivation was only about a century. Even geniuses with Heavenly Spiritual Roots could only achieve this much with opportunities like being empowered by a Buddha Bone Shard. Otherwise, being trapped by bottlenecks for over a hundred years was commonplace.</p><p>The bottleneck to late-Nascent Soul stage likely wouldn't be as easily overcome.</p><p>But Qin Sang was brimming with confidence!</p><p>He wondered if he would have the chance to break through to late-Nascent Soul stage before the arrival of his first Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Throughout the entire cultivation world, those who could achieve this were all unparalleled geniuses.</p><p>Fatty and Dumb Aunt, who cultivated alongside his true body, hadn't undergone significant changes.</p><p>Qin Sang still hadn't found the optimal method to nurture his own Life-Bound Insect Gu, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, so naturally, he couldn't help Fatty. The only thing he could do was feed it a Myriad Spirit Fruit.</p><p>He could only wait until his future travels, bringing Fatty along, allowing it to search for food on its own.</p><p>After Fatty advanced to the fourth transformation, he could clearly sense Dumb Aunt's condition improving, though her awakening remained distant.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly also improved, but couldn't keep pace with its master.</p><p>Qin Sang not only utilized the Blood-Feeding Technique of the Witch Tribe that he had learned before, but also combined it with the Insect Control Secret Arts he had gathered from the North Sea, as well as the Central Continent inheritance secret arts that his avatar had acquired through various channels over the years.  He cross-referenced and summarized them, formulating a unique nurturing method of his own.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly's cultivation speed increased, though it certainly couldn't compare to the Witch Tribe's secret art.</p><p>While the true body cultivated, the avatar operated in the open.</p><p>The name of Daoist Qing Feng, the ancestor of the Xie Clan, gradually became known to various powers in Zhuozhou.</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang's battle with Cheng Huanzi, using only swordsmanship, resulted in a complete victory.</p><p>In the first few years, this news spread like wildfire.  Many were curious about the prowess of Daoist Qing Feng, who was friends with Qin Sang, anticipating a clash between the Xie Clan and the Six Void Sect.</p><p>To the disappointment of outsiders, both sides exercised restraint.</p><p>The disciples of the Xie Clan only operated within Fudù County, seemingly forgetting the half of Hongping County they had won in the wager, which remained under the control of the Six Void Sect.</p><p>The Six Void Sect was initially very wary.  Seeing the Xie Clan only managing Fudù County without displaying excessive ambition, they couldn't justify taking action against them.</p><p>With both sides maintaining peace, the Xie Clan developed steadily, which was precisely the outcome Qin Sang desired.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't occupy the Xie Clan's cave dwelling for free.</p><p>The avatar, acting as the Xie Clan's ancestor, was also responsible.</p><p>Not only did he personally heal Xie An's injuries, but he also held lectures on the Dao for the Xie Clan disciples every so often.  Although the content was rudimentary, it was exactly what the Xie Clan disciples needed.</p><p>Now, a talented junior within the Xie Clan had successfully formed their Gold Core, but was still far from reaching Nascent Soul. Many things still required Qin Sang's personal attention.</p><p>Whenever Qin Sang lectured, Zhou Jin would also bring his family to listen.</p><p>After refining pills according to the recipes provided by Qin Sang and giving them to Ruan Yu, her chronic illness was successfully cured, and her cultivation progressed by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Zhou Jin was deeply grateful to Qin Sang and often referred to himself as Qin Sang's registered disciple. The Tower Terrace View and the Xie Clan also enjoyed a close relationship.</p><p>Having these two powers under his wing was sufficient.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that he was a newcomer with shallow roots.  Establishing a sect was not something that could be achieved overnight. He didn't plan to widely accept disciples in Central Continent, prioritizing his own cultivation.</p><p>Progress on the "Ice Soul Divine Light" was less than satisfactory, so the avatar devoted most of his time to the "Treasure Circulation Art."</p><p>The "Treasure Circulation Art" progressed smoothly.  Having cultivated it to a certain level, the avatar could already control the Four-Chariot Azure Snake Seal in combat.</p><p>Because he had obtained the complete "Treasure Circulation Art," although it wasn't as compatible as the Glazed Jade, its power surpassed what it was in Tong Lingyu's hands.</p><p>The "Treasure Circulation Art" allowed him to control spirit treasures without directly draining the user like the Sun God Tree, making it more versatile and easier to use than the Sun God Tree.</p><p>Besides cultivation, Qin Sang hadn't forgotten his mission in Central Continent.</p><p>The avatar wasn't always confined to the Clear Void Illusion Realm. From time to time, he would leave seclusion, befriending other fellow cultivators, and even personally visited Lu Zhang at Mount Nevermind, witnessing the grandeur of a super-sect in Central Continent.</p><p>Through Lu Zhang's introduction, he became acquainted with several Nascent Soul cultivators from Mount Nevermind.</p><p>In addition, the avatar also actively contacted several top trading companies, including the Six Continents Hall, entrusting them to inquire about the Ghost Mother.</p><p>There was no shortage of cultivators nicknamed Ghost Mother in Central Continent, but they weren't the one Qin Sang sought.</p><p>This was somewhat unexpected.</p><p>Logically speaking, the Ghost Mother was also new to Central Continent, having no grudges or connections with the local powers.  There was no need for her to conceal her identity.  As long as she was active, she would inevitably leave traces.</p><p>Qin Sang even began to suspect that the Ghost Mother might have unfortunately encountered a ferocious beast attack while crossing the Storm Zone, suffering severe injuries or even perishing!</p><p>Thinking optimistically, she might be recuperating somewhere.</p><p>Unable to find the Ghost Mother after so long, Qin Sang couldn't simply wait.  After careful consideration, he selected some information that might pique the Ghost Mother's interest and actively spread it, waiting for her to follow the trail.</p><p>After being rescued from the water prison by Tan Hao, the Ghost Mother hadn't gone back on her word. Although she couldn't save Tan Jie, she had tried her best and helped Tan Hao obtain the opportunity to form his Nascent Soul.  At least she wasn't utterly ruthless and vicious.</p><p>Unless the Ghost Mother had already advanced to Deity Transformation stage, with Qin Sang and his avatar joining forces, wielding two spirit treasures, they wouldn't fear her turning against them.</p><p>As for the Celestial Unity Palace and Celestial Balance Palace, there was also no progress.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Zhang knew nothing, Qin Sang had a premonition that these two celestial palaces likely held unusual secrets within Central Continent. Otherwise, why would they be so tightly sealed?</p><p>During his subsequent investigations, Qin Sang exercised caution, proceeding methodically to avoid exposing his purpose.</p><p>It wouldn't be too late to conduct a large-scale investigation after his true body emerged from seclusion and advanced to late-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Clear Void Illusion Realm, Qin Sang's avatar was also in quiet cultivation.</p><p>Without mastering the "Ice Soul Divine Light," the avatar only had spirit treasures as his trump card, and his usual combat methods were limited. Qin Sang planned to further enhance the avatar's cultivation before considering venturing out.</p><p>The morning sun bathed Mount Pu in a vibrant, flourishing light.</p><p>The disciples of the Xie Clan were either soaring through the clouds or standing atop mountain peaks, basking in the sunlight and absorbing the purple qi.</p><p>It was Xie Qian's turn to handle worldly affairs outside.</p><p>Looking at these energetic juniors, a hopeful smile unconsciously spread across Xie Qian's face. He was hopeful for the Xie Clan's future.</p><p>He was nearing the end of his lifespan.</p><p>Cultivating in the Clear Void Illusion Realm and receiving guidance from Qin Sang, his cultivation had improved, but due to his limited lifespan, he had lost the possibility of forming his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Being able to witness the Xie Clan's revival before his death, Xie Qian was already content, feeling that his life hadn't been in vain and that he wouldn't be ashamed to face his ancestors in the underworld.</p><p>Thinking of this, he couldn't help but glance at the Xie Clan Stone.</p><p>Everything they had now was bestowed by that person!</p><p>Was this person truly the ancestor of the Xie Clan?</p><p>Xie Qian had no doubts about this because he never dwelled on the question.</p><p>Just as he was about to return to the hall, Xie Qian suddenly noticed a cloud formation beneath the orange-red morning sun, drifting towards Mount Pu.</p><p>The sky was clear and bright, with sparse clouds.</p><p>Only this cloud remained dense and unyielding, moving swiftly.</p><p>Xie Qian focused his gaze, realizing that the cloud itself was actually white.  He thought of a certain person, immediately replacing the relaxed expression on his face with seriousness.  Channeling his True Essence, his voice resounded across Mount Pu:  "Everyone, return to your cave dwellings immediately!  Without permission, no one is to go out!"</p><p>The Xie Clan disciples stirred for a moment but didn't dare to disobey their ancestor's orders.  In the blink of an eye, the mountain was devoid of figures.</p><p>Xie Qian then performed a concealment technique, hastily entering the Clear Void Illusion Realm to report, "Ancestor, Elder Lu Zhang of Mount Nevermind has come to visit."</p><p>Outside Mount Pu, atop the white cloud, two figures stood side by side.</p><p>One of them was indeed Lu Zhang.</p><p>The other was a monk clad in kasaya robes.</p><p>The monk had a dignified appearance with thick eyebrows, large eyes, and earlobes as large as wheels, resembling a Buddha statue.  He looked no older than twenty, yet the aura emanating from him was incredibly profound, rivaling even Lu Zhang's.</p><p>Standing on the cloud, the monk had his eyes slightly closed, twirling a string of prayer beads in one hand, muttering something under his breath.  It was unclear whether he was chanting scriptures or doing something else.</p><p>Lu Zhang didn't disturb the monk, maintaining his silence until he saw Mount Pu. He then gestured with his hand, saying, "Zen Master Xiaoxing, that's Mount Pu ahead."</p><p>Zen Master Xiaoxing paused, lowered his hand, and gazed intently at the mountain.  A trace of doubt flickered in his eyes as he scanned Mount Pu.</p><p>Lu Zhang noticed this and smiled faintly, offering a cryptic remark, "Could even a Zen Master be deceived by outward appearances?"</p><p>"Amitabha."</p><p>Zen Master Xiaoxing chanted a Buddhist phrase. "A mountain's greatness doesn't lie in its height! There must be something more to this mountain to retain Daoist Qing Feng."</p><p>Lu Zhang nodded.  "Rest assured, Zen Master. Daoist Qing Feng's cultivation isn't inferior to ours.  That Daoist Qin is even more extraordinary, rarely having any rivals among his peers. He must have a significant background.  Seeking them out is definitely the right choice. Look, Daoist Qing Feng is already aware of our arrival…"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the mystical light of the protective formation parted to the sides, revealing a figure emerging from the mountain.</p><p>Lu Zhang raised his voice, "Daoist Qing Feng, we've come to visit unannounced.  We hope we haven't disturbed your cultivation?"</p><p>"What are you saying, Daoist Lu…"</p><p>Qin Sang and Lu Zhang were already quite familiar.  He chuckled, shaking his head, having already noticed the monk beside Lu Zhang. "And this esteemed monk is?"</p><p>"This humble monk's Dharma name is Xiaoxing."</p><p>Zen Master Xiaoxing stepped forward.  "Greetings, Daoist Qing Feng."</p><p>"Could you be Zen Master Xiaoxing of the Sweet Dew Monastery?"</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly startled, a sense of awe rising within him.</p><p>Having been in Central Continent for many years, Qin Sang had already inquired about the major super-sects and was certainly not unfamiliar with the Sweet Dew Monastery.</p><p>The reason was simple: the current Sweet Dew Monastery had a Deity Transformation cultivator, the Holy One Huiguang!</p><p>The Sweet Dew Monastery was located in the six states of Jiangzuo, the most prosperous land in the world.</p><p>Within the six states of Jiangzuo, there also existed a Daoist Immortal Sect no less powerful than the Sweet Dew Monastery.  It was the Eight Scenery Peak that Qin Sang had encountered in the Storm Zone, whose True Monarch's Dharma name was Danyu, a figure as renowned as the Holy One Huiguang.</p><p>Qin Sang sought opportunities for Deity Transformation and to explore the secrets beyond the Storm Zone. In the future, he would inevitably interact with them.  He hadn't expected the Sweet Dew Monastery to initiate a visit.</p><p>He shouldn't have any connection with the Sweet Dew Monastery. Surely, they weren't here to seek justice for the Zhulan Temple?</p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through his mind in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang looked inquiringly at Lu Zhang but received no hints.  The welcoming smile remained on his face.  "With your visit, my humble mountain is honored. Please come in!"</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang led the two into the main hall of the mountain gate, where they each took a seat.</p><p>"Don't worry, Fellow Daoist. I introduced Zen Master Xiaoxing to you, hoping to ask you a few questions." Lu Zhang bowed slightly, offering an explanation.</p><p>Qin Sang uttered an "Oh."  "I wonder what I can do to assist the Zen Master?"</p><p>He was also secretly observing the two across from him.</p><p>He hadn't heard of any connection between Mount Nevermind and the Sweet Dew Monastery. Perhaps the two had a personal relationship.</p><p>Zen Master Xiaoxing exchanged a glance with Lu Zhang.  "May this humble monk be so bold as to ask, where in the East Sea did Daoist Qing Feng and Daoist Qin cultivate before?"</p><p>How would I know?</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly scoffed.</p><p>His background was entirely fabricated.</p><p>"This humble Daoist's previous cave dwelling was on Qingyang Island. As for Daoist Qin, without his permission, I apologize but I cannot disclose it." Qin Sang didn't lie.</p><p>He just didn't know if there was a Qingyang Island in Central Continent.</p><p>Zen Master Xiaoxing twirled his prayer beads a few times, as if recalling something. After a moment, he shook his head at Lu Zhang.</p><p>Lu Zhang asked, "Most of the Immortal Mountains in the East Sea are near the coast. The further one travels into the depths, the more sparse the islands become, with rampant monstrous beasts and few human traces.  Even Nascent Soul cultivators rarely venture there.  Could the Qingyang Island that the Daoist mentioned be in the outer sea region?"</p><p>Qin Sang had prepared for this before fabricating his background, and he answered fluently, "To be honest with you two, when my cultivation was low, I offended an enemy and was forced to flee.  I luckily landed on Qingyang Island and was taken in by a senior on the island, which allowed me to survive.  This island isn't in the deep sea, but it can't be considered near the coast either.  The surrounding area is indeed quite dangerous, making it difficult to find like-minded fellow cultivators."</p><p>"Then that's it!"</p><p>Lu Zhang clapped his hands and laughed, turning to Zen Master Xiaoxing. "Zen Master, there's no need to trouble yourself further.  If this person comes from the outer sea, Daoist Qing Feng should have heard of him."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  "Are you two looking for someone?"</p><p>Zen Master Xiaoxing no longer kept up the pretense.  "Indeed, this person's origins are unknown, and we suspect they may be from the East Sea. However, although some disciples of the monastery travel in the East Sea, they rarely venture into the outer sea.  Thanks to Daoist Lu's guidance, we've come to consult with Daoist Qing Feng."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Judging by the tone of Zen Master Xiaoxing and Lu Zhang, the person they were looking for hadn't just offended Zen Master Xiaoxing alone, but the entire Sweet Dew Monastery.</p><p>A top power in Central Continent going to great lengths, with their experts traveling everywhere to hunt down a single person.</p><p>This scene felt somewhat familiar…</p><p>A name immediately flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p>
