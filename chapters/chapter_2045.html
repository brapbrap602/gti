<h1>Chapter Two Thousand and Thirty-Six: A Back View</h1><p>Chapter 1608: A Back View</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's reply, Ghost Mother was somewhat surprised.</p><p>"She didn't choose the wrong person… Why not ask her own thoughts? Or, find me another member of the Witch Clan, and the previous terms still stand."</p><p>Qin Sang said regretfully, "The Teleportation Formation is in the Purple Firmament Palace. There's no going back."</p><p>With the Purple Firmament Palace's ascension, the path was severed, unless the Nascent Soul cultivator's relics contained a sea chart leading to the Boundless Sea.</p><p>"The materials for the formation have already been prepared. A few drops of her essence blood will serve as a guide. It won't harm her. I won't hide it from you; during the crossing, I'll need her to carry my soul."</p><p>Ghost Mother confessed the process of her 'return' to Qin Sang, stating solemnly, "I have a premonition that my physical body is hidden in the place of return. This is one of the reasons why I must return! You needn't doubt me. The Divine Silkworm willingly acknowledged her as its master. The bond between them is so deep that it can even reach a symbiotic level, something no one can take away. Moreover, it only possesses a trace of Divine Silkworm bloodline. Its future potential remains uncertain, not necessarily surpassing my spirit insects. If you're still worried that I'll harm her, I can swear a Heart Demon Oath and a Karmic Oath. As long as I live, I will never let her be harmed!"</p><p>Because of the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang was always somewhat distrustful of Heart Demon Oaths.</p><p>After arriving in the Middle Continent, Qin Sang learned something about Karmic Oaths.</p><p>Karmic Oaths were very binding, and no one wanted to bear the consequences of breaking them. The drawback was that the process of making the oath was very complicated and impractical in most situations.</p><p>Regardless, awakening Ya Gu required Ghost Mother's help.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't object and first woke Ya Gu.</p><p>"What preparations are needed?" Qin Sang asked cautiously.</p><p>"For now, we can only forcibly guide her consciousness, barely responding through the Divine Silkworm.  Rashly awakening her would have significant drawbacks. Although she and her natal insect Gu are one, there must be a distinction between master and servant. She has slumbered for too long. The process of awakening her must be gradual, otherwise she will be dominated by her natal insect Gu. Even within the Witch Clan, there's no shortage of those who have become insect slaves."</p><p>Ghost Mother gestured for Qin Sang to help Ya Gu sit up in a meditative posture. She herself busied herself within the cave, setting up layers of restrictions to prevent any disturbance.</p><p>Awakening Ya Gu had to be done in the quietest environment.</p><p>Qin Sang stood by, closely watching Ghost Mother cast her spell.</p><p>Ghost Mother understood Qin Sang's thoughts. She didn't hide any of her actions from him and even took the initiative to explain the deeper meaning of each movement.</p><p>Refining a Celestial Corpse Talisman was simple, but the process of undoing it was very complex.</p><p>She flicked her jade-like fingers, and thousands of complex runes flowed from her fingertips like water, converging into a river of light, both azure and white, within the cave.</p><p>The river of light flowed around Ya Gu, connecting end to end, transforming into a ring of light, which finally descended slowly, enclosing Ya Gu and the stone bed within its center.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know much about Witchcraft, but based on his experience, he guessed it was some kind of restrictive formation.</p><p>Ghost Mother's expression was solemn, and her movements became increasingly swift.</p><p>The restrictive formation was exceedingly complex.  Ghost Mother spent several hours, until dawn broke in the east, before it was complete.</p><p>Wiping the sweat from her brow, Ghost Mother let out a soft sigh, pointing her joined fingers at Ya Gu's brow. Just as she was about to do something, she suddenly stopped and turned to ask Qin Sang, "Did you personally inscribe the Shadow Bone Markings on her?"</p><p>"I did."</p><p>Ghost Mother took a step back. "Next, we need to continue inscribing Divine Markings, using the power of the Divine Markings to pry open the Celestial Corpse Talisman and guide her consciousness. This will also serve as the foundation for her future awakening. You should do it, lest you suspect me of doing something to her."</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang readily accepted, taking over from Ghost Mother.</p><p>"These Divine Markings are quite complex, but they shouldn't be a problem for you. Stabilize your True Essence and follow my instructions," Ghost Mother patiently guided Qin Sang, leaving no detail out.</p><p>Qin Sang meticulously used his hand as a brush and his True Essence as ink, starting from Ya Gu's brow, carefully drawing the Divine Markings. In the process of inscribing the Divine Markings, he gradually sensed changes in Ya Gu.</p><p>Her aura grew increasingly clear. The light of the restrictive formation shone upon her, draping her in a layer of hazy gauze. Her features seemed to gain a touch of vitality, as if she could awaken and open her eyes at any moment.</p><p>"Let the Divine Silkworm return!"</p><p>Ghost Mother's voice rang in his ears.</p><p>Fatty was Ya Gu's anchor in the mortal realm.  Next, they had to rely on Fatty's power.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately commanded Fatty to return to Ya Gu's Nascent Soul. At the same time, he completed the last stroke of the Divine Marking. Fatty immediately began to snore.</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely sensed that a new connection seemed to have formed between Ya Gu and Fatty.  He carefully examined Ya Gu, but couldn't see any outward changes.</p><p>After waiting for a short while,</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but glance at Ghost Mother. With her nod, he channeled his divine sense, probing into Ya Gu's Purple Mansion, calling out to Ya Gu's consciousness through Fatty.</p><p>Call after call, yet all sank like stones into the sea.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't give up, persistently calling out, finally receiving a response after five hundred years of separation!</p><p>"…I…am…willing…"</p><p>The voice was extremely faint.</p><p>Like someone who had fallen into a thousand-foot abyss, screaming and pleading for help, yet unable to be heard by those above the cliff, surrounded by endless darkness and despair. She had persevered for five hundred years, and finally a gust of wind appeared in the abyss, carrying her cries for help out.</p><p>Even so, the response was incredibly weak, even though Ya Gu had exerted all her strength.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as though a lifetime had passed. He was stunned for a moment before realizing Ya Gu's meaning.</p><p>Ya Gu had heard his conversation with Ghost Mother.</p><p>Previous signs indicated that Ya Gu could only maintain her consciousness from sinking through Fatty and could only perceive external changes when Fatty experienced significant fluctuations, like when Qin Sang had escaped into the poisonous pool in the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>As her condition improved, she had become able to perceive the outside world, just unable to respond.</p><p>She was willing to go with Ghost Mother.</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent.</p><p>He had envisioned what he would say to Ya Gu when she awoke, but never expected her first words to be like this. Ya Gu didn't even ask whether Ghost Mother was good or bad.</p><p>"You don't owe me anything, and don't think you can repay me by selling yourself. That Witch Clan Nascent Soul cultivator has long since perished.  The Demonic Tribulation was so devastating, his bones were likely scattered, and his relics plundered. The possibility of them being preserved until now is extremely low. I am of human descent, and my Nascent Soul opportunity lies within my own race. Remember, live for yourself…"</p><p>Qin Sang spelled out the risks to Ya Gu, word by word, unafraid of Ghost Mother hearing.</p><p>Ghost Mother still remembered Tan Hao's life-saving grace and was presumably not utterly wicked, but too many unknown secrets surrounded her. Ya Gu's involvement held an unpredictable outcome.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang wasn't very interested in the Witch Clan Nascent Soul cultivator's relics. Even if he obtained them, they might not be useful to him.</p><p>What Ghost Mother definitely wouldn't guess was that he was actually interested in the South Sea Immortal Palace itself.</p><p>He intended to downplay the value of Ghost Mother's bargaining chip and find another way to enter the South Sea Immortal Palace, such as helping Ghost Mother find the Nascent Soul cultivator's relics.</p><p>…</p><p>Hearing this, Ghost Mother's expression shifted slightly, but she didn't refute.</p><p>She had to admit that Qin Sang's words were true. The likelihood of finding the Nascent Soul cultivator's remains was extremely low; otherwise, she wouldn't be clinging so tightly to Ya Gu.</p><p>Even if she found the Nascent Soul cultivator's remains, it didn't guarantee she would obtain the sea chart.  There was almost no contact between the Middle Continent and the Boundless Sea, suggesting the distance between them must be even greater than that to the North Sea.</p><p>Now, the storm belt was teeming with ferocious beasts and fraught with peril, making crossing the sea extremely dangerous.</p><p>There was another reason she hadn't revealed.</p><p>She was Ya Gu's lifeline, and vice versa.</p><p>The destruction of the ancient devil of the Purifying Sea Sect wasn't simply a matter of its true nature being completely worn away by the ancient seal.</p><p>Breaking free from the seal only allowed Ghost Mother to live a little longer.  She had a premonition that her time was running out.  While she couldn't be certain how long she could hold on, she knew it was best to return as soon as possible.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't imagine the ecstasy Ghost Mother felt upon seeing Ya Gu. If not for her strong composure, she would have surely burst into maniacal laughter.</p><p>After a long time, she finally received a second response from Ya Gu.</p><p>"…I…want…to…become…stronger!"</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless.</p><p>Ghost Mother smiled.</p><p>After a long silence, Qin Sang said to Ghost Mother, "Take her as your disciple."</p><p>Ghost Mother chuckled. "Taking the master of the Divine Silkworm as a disciple is something countless Witch Clan Grandmasters dream of. It's I who am taking advantage. In the future, you'll be grateful for today's choice. I will certainly treat her as my own, and I can include this in the oath."</p><p>"When you return, I must witness it with my own eyes."</p><p>"I need to choose a suitable location for the formation first. I'll tell you the location once it's decided." Ghost Mother agreed to everything.</p><p>The Heart Demon Oath was simple.</p><p>The Karmic Oath, however, required setting up an altar.</p><p>Preparing the altar consumed a day and a night. Before they knew it, it was dawn again. The Grand Auction was about to begin, and Qin Sang didn't have time to participate.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang carefully considered the content of the oath, ensuring there were no loopholes, and called out to Ya Gu multiple times, but received no response.</p><p>Those two responses seemed to have exhausted all of Ya Gu's strength.</p><p>The altar was complete.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ghost Mother burned incense and bowed nine times, completing the oath. Then, Qin Sang had Ghost Mother swear an oath before Ya Gu, taking her as a disciple.</p><p>Fulfilling her promise, Ghost Mother handed Qin Sang a jade slip. "This is the insect control secret art, the 'Panhu True Scripture.' This is the very secret art I cultivate, certainly stronger than what you learned in the Boundless Sea.  Additionally, I recall a type of high-rank spirit insect called the Waterfire Divine Centipede. You can cultivate in that direction."</p><p>Qin Sang skimmed through it. The 'Panhu True Scripture' was indeed profound. The Spirit Ascension Ritual and the Three Spirits Pan King Formation were both secret arts within the scripture.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, however, puzzled him.</p><p>Water and fire were incompatible. How could he make the Fire Jade Centipede mutate in that direction?</p><p>Ghost Mother was generous, sharing her cultivation experience with Qin Sang without reservation. Finally, she said, "Alright, the method to enter the South Sea Immortal Palace is simple. I'll impart to you the Bone Seeking Secret Art. You should hurry to the Taiyue Sect in the Southern Continent.  If you leave now, you can still make it."</p><p>"Now?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. "The Hungry Ghost Festival is in three days. Who would open the South Sea Immortal Palace at this time?"</p><p>"Those plotting against the South Sea Immortal Palace are remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect, who have secretly formed the Gu God Cult, gathering their former followers. They intend to take advantage of the Hungry Ghost Festival, attracting the top experts from sects like the Eight Sceneries View northwards, while they create chaos in the Southern Border," Ghost Mother paused. "However, the Eight Sceneries View isn't simple either. The Buddhist and Daoist sects succeeded the Formless Immortal Sect as the dominant power and must have some understanding of the South Sea Immortal Palace. I followed the Eight Sceneries View's队伍 to Jin Yu Continent, intending to capture an important figure for questioning, but unfortunately, they always stayed together, and I never had a chance to strike.  It wasn't until the day I encountered you that I realized the Eight Sceneries View's Sect Master might be an imposter. Hehe, the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.  You're sure to see a good show if you go."</p><p>…</p><p>The Gu God Cult, the Eight Sceneries View, the Taiyue Sect…</p><p>The seemingly tranquil cultivation world was already teeming with hidden currents.</p><p>The Gu God Cult was actually comprised of remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect!</p><p>Qin Sang, focused on his avatar's breakthrough, hadn't interacted with the Gu God Cult, nearly missing the South Sea Immortal Palace.</p><p>"Those Gu God Cult members are very cautious and haven't revealed much information. I used some underhanded methods and learned that the entrance to the South Sea Immortal Palace isn't at the Taiyue Sect, but rather through the former site of the Formless Immortal Sect. There's a Teleportation Formation there leading to the South Sea Immortal Palace.  When the Formless Immortal Sect was destroyed, the remaining experts desperately sealed their sect to prevent it from being seized, and only descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect know how to open it. The surviving members of the Formless Immortal Sect were hunted down and scattered, which is another reason," Ghost Mother told Qin Sang everything she knew.</p><p>The more Qin Sang heard, the more he felt something was amiss. "Aren't you going?"</p><p>"I already have her. Why should I risk getting involved in the struggle for the Immortal Palace? For me, nothing is more important than returning.  No matter how good the treasures of the Immortal Palace are, they are useless to me. Though the Nascent Soul cultivator is missing, my cultivation is restricted, and I'm not immortal."</p><p>Ghost Mother didn't shy away from admitting her fear of danger.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator's remains were secondary. The South Sea Immortal Palace and the Formless Immortal Sect were related to the 'Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter.' Qin Sang had to go, no matter what.</p><p>The Taiyue Sect was far away in the Southern Continent. He had to decide quickly.</p><p>Hesitation would only lead to trouble!</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Ya Gu, sighed heavily, and said solemnly, "I entrust her to you, Senior.  You might as well take Ya Gu to Pu Mountain in Zhuo Continent to settle down.  I'll go to the Southern Continent now."</p><p>Before leaving, Ghost Mother suddenly called out to Qin Sang.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's surprised gaze, Ghost Mother summoned Fatty.</p><p>Fatty sensed impending doom and wriggled frantically, wailing incessantly, only to be flicked hard on the head by Ghost Mother.</p><p>Ghost Mother scolded, "Behave yourself!  Such a lazy disposition, without a trace of the Divine Silkworm's elegance. I must properly discipline you in the future, so as not to tarnish the Divine Silkworm's reputation!"</p><p>Fatty's eyes glazed over, resigned to its fate, allowing Ghost Mother to manipulate it.</p><p>A ball of white light appeared in Ghost Mother's palm, enveloping Fatty. The light grew increasingly intense, and Fatty occasionally let out a shriek, but quickly swallowed it back, fearing further punishment.</p><p>Soon, rainbow-colored light gradually emerged from the palm, separating the poison sac from Fatty's body.</p><p>Fatty lay like a dead insect, its body limp, barely breathing.</p><p>Ghost Mother handed the poison sac to Qin Sang. "To awaken the Divine Silkworm bloodline, we must eliminate all other interfering factors. The separated poison sac will inherit some of its divine abilities. It's quite a valuable treasure.  As for its specific powers, you'll have to comprehend them yourself."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang hesitate, Ghost Mother glanced at Ya Gu with pity. "This is also her wish. Five hundred years of unwavering companionship, how could she repay you? This poison sac is the only thing she can do for you. You know the power of Heart Demons, don't you?  You wouldn't want her to carry this burden on her journey, would you?"</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, taking the poison sac.  He walked to Ya Gu, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gazed into her closed eyes. "You must be strong!"</p><p>Fatty shifted its plump body, crawled onto Qin Sang's hand, and bit down on his finger.  With a *crack*, a few of its teeth chipped off, its face filled with a pitiful expression.</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless.  He also cultivated his body, possessing iron bones and bronze skin. His physical body was comparable to a Demon King's. Moreover, Fatty was at its weakest point.</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing Fatty's pitiful expression, Qin Sang softened the skin of his finger, curious to see what it wanted to do.</p><p>Fatty bit a small wound and licked Qin Sang's blood.  Seeming to know it was about to be separated from him, it rubbed against Qin Sang's hand repeatedly, clearly reluctant.</p><p>"Haven't raised you for nothing all this time."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't feel any change. He reached out and stroked Fatty's head, steeling himself as he handed it to Ghost Mother.</p><p>The morning light was still dim.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure sped through the mountains.</p><p>Inside the cave,</p><p>Ghost Mother crouched beside Ya Gu, turning her face towards the cave entrance.  She gently brushed her eyelids and whispered, "Take a 'look' at him."</p><p>Ya Gu's eyes opened.  Her expression remained vacant, but a glimmer of divine light seemed to flash in the depths of her pupils.</p><p>"Why not express your feelings to him?  Once you go to the other realm with me, you might never have the chance to see him again."  Ghost Mother was curious.</p><p>"I…am…not…worthy."</p><p>Ya Gu's response was still fragmented, though not as difficult as before, but her voice was filled with bitterness.</p><p>Ghost Mother sighed softly. "I thought I would have to expend some effort to persuade you. You're more perceptive than I expected. Ya Gu…"</p><p>"My name…is…Jin Liuying!"</p><p>"Good!  I'll help you become Jin Liuying again!  Tell me, what are you thinking?"</p><p>"I…hope…this…is…the…last…time…I…see…Big Brother Qin's…back…"</p><p>Ghost Mother understood.  "To stand before him as an equal won't be easy.  Your Big Brother Qin has reached the pinnacle in this broken world. One day, he will return to the vast ocean, his future limitless.  Your resolve is not yet strong enough."</p><p>"I swear!"</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p><p>39314342…</p><p>…</p>
