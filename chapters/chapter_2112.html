<h1>Chapter 2102: Internal Stability Precedes External Defense</h1><p>Chapter 2103: Internal Stability Precedes External Defense</p><p>A warm spring day.  Yet, the atmosphere in Qingyang Temple felt icy cold.</p><p>Those factions who had harbored ill intentions and failed to provide timely reinforcements to the North Sea felt uneasy.  They had received the invitation with trepidation, yet lacked the courage to refuse, so they came to the ceremony with forced smiles.</p><p>Upon arriving at Qingyang Temple, they were treated with exceptional courtesy.  The amiable atmosphere lulled them into a false sense of security—that this was a joyous occasion for the Temple, and that any past transgressions would be overlooked for the sake of the greater good, especially with external threats looming.</p><p>Now, the truth was clear.  Fear and anxiety gripped everyone. Some were restless, their hearts pounding in their chests.</p><p>"After immense sacrifices, as soon as the situation improved slightly, some impatiently jumped in to claim victory’s spoils!  For personal gain, they showed ingratitude and disregarded the fate of their allies!  What's even more ridiculous is that true victory is still far off. They didn't anticipate the Changyou clan leader's breakthrough to the second stage of the Void Realm."</p><p>Qin Sang's voice dripped with sarcasm.  "If I hadn't arrived in time, what would have happened? You were teetering on the brink of collapse, yet you continued your internal squabbling and backstabbing, throwing away your last hope!"</p><p>Silence descended upon the assembled factions. Only Qin Sang's resounding voice filled the temple.</p><p>Some felt shame; others, righteous anger; still others, fear.</p><p>"Perhaps some of you thought that since I've returned, there's someone to shoulder the burden—that as long as I stop the Changyou clan leader, the situation isn't that dire," Qin Sang surveyed the crowd, a cold smile playing on his lips.  "Those with such thoughts are nothing but frogs in a well, short-sighted and ignorant!"</p><p>Amidst the uproar, Qin Sang looked up at the vast sky beyond the Temple, his voice soft yet heavy.</p><p>"Having fought the Changyou clan for years, you should know they are just one clan among many within the Yi people. But how many clans are there? And what are their strengths?"</p><p>No one answered. Qin Sang answered himself.</p><p>"The Yi people are divided into Upper Clans and Lesser Clans based on strength. The Changyou clan is a Lesser Clan under the Zhuyan clan, ranking among the weakest.</p><p>"And the Zhuyan clan isn't the strongest of the Upper Clans.  The Upper Clans are led by the Yuren clan, forming the Celestial Division, alongside the Water Division, led by the Jiaoren clan, which is of equal strength.</p><p>"The stronger Lesser Clans have Void Realm, second-stage masters—that is, cultivators at the Void Refinement stage.  The Upper Clans must have masters equivalent to the Unity stage, but they've long withdrawn from the world.</p><p>"As for the Yuren and Jiaoren clans, their strength is unfathomable!"</p><p>Only then did the assembled factions understand the true scope of the situation.  Their previous speculations had vastly underestimated the Yi people. Their power exceeded all expectations; the small Storm Realm could never hope to stand against them. Qin Sang’s assessment was correct; they were indeed frogs in a well.</p><p>"This is our predicament.  If the Changyou clan finds themselves outmatched, they'll seek help from other clans, but we have no allies.  Are there still those among you who think that driving back the Changyou clan will bring peace and allow you to divide the Storm Realm?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the faces of the assembled factions, each of them avoiding his eyes.</p><p>"Perhaps some will ask, 'Doesn't the Great Thousand World have human, witch, and demon clans besides the Yi people?' Yes, and their strength is no less than the Yi people's."</p><p>Before anyone could rejoice, Qin Sang's face darkened, his head shaking slightly. "But they are billions of miles away, and this is Yi territory. No one will risk their lives to save us."</p><p>Hope, just glimpsed, was brutally shattered. Morale plummeted.</p><p>Confusion reigned.  This was a desperate situation, with no path to victory in sight.  Even those who doubted Qin Sang’s warnings dared not question him openly.</p><p>"This is the reality we face.  To survive here, we can only rely on ourselves. But do not despair. I was born and raised here.  Since I have returned, I will not stand idly by and watch the Storm Realm and its people perish. But I alone am insufficient.  We need everyone to work together—only then is there a sliver of hope!"</p><p>Qin Sang’s voice rose, inspiring a surge of emotion.</p><p>But his tone immediately shifted. "Therefore, those who undermine our efforts must be purged!"</p><p>"Bring them forth!"</p><p>His thunderous voice jolted everyone back to reality.</p><p>A beam of green light shot from the ground to the clouds, transforming into a stairway. Qingyang Temple's disciplinary disciples brought forward several cultivators, their faces ashen.</p><p>The crowd stared, seeing defeat etched on the faces of the bound cultivators.</p><p>"Hey! Isn't that Hong the Demon Cultivator?  After his ascension, he vanished without a trace. I thought he was dead!  To think he's already broken through to the Divine Transformation stage…" someone recognized the leader.</p><p>"I know that one. He's the big demon from the Canglang Sea. They say he slaughtered his entire clan—old and young—to cultivate his evil arts. Every time he appears, he wipes out entire families.  He's incredibly vicious…"</p><p>"That one's Daoist name is Yuan Gui. He loves to exploit people's kindness.  Countless small sects have been destroyed by him, each death more gruesome than the last."</p><p>…</p><p>One by one, the demon cultivators led by Hong were identified, their atrocities laid bare for all to see—a catalogue of unspeakable crimes.  This wasn't surprising; those gathered by Hong were all notorious villains.</p><p>The crowd wondered why the Qingyang Sect had apprehended these demons.</p><p>The disciples of the Enforcement Hall brought Hong and the others before the main peak and bowed.</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "Tell me, what have you done?"</p><p>Hong's lips quivered. His eyes were vacant, his voice flat and monotonous as he recounted their deeds without reservation.</p><p>"After the last battle for the Green Spirit Qi, the Jiao Dragon King approached us and ordered us to work for him.  Decades ago, news of the Qingyang Sect's resurgence spread. The Jiao Dragon King instructed us to secretly contact Min Shan, the supreme general of the Changyou Tribe, and then leak the information to them, luring them to the North Sea…"</p><p>The revelation sent shockwaves through the assembly.</p><p>An uproar erupted. The Changyou Tribe's attack had been perfectly timed; someone had provided information. The mastermind was none other than the Yaohai Sea Clan.</p><p>If not for the intervention of the Glass Fairy leading the forces from Central State and the North Sea, the Yaohai Sea Clan would have fallen to the Changyou Tribe long ago. Now, they were striking back.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  "Bring up the Jiao Dragon King."</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The sound of iron chains echoed. Several thick black chains descended from the clouds, taut and straining, dragging a huge creature from the ground—the Jiao Dragon King, his true form revealed.</p><p>Divine Transformation Stage Late!</p><p>Seeing the Jiao Dragon King's cultivation, the crowd understood his betrayal.  The demon was arrogant and rebellious, clearly unwilling to be subservient.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King roared angrily, struggling furiously against his confinement, stirring the winds in the heavens, his ferocity undiminished.  The chains strained and rattled, threatening to snap.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A bolt of lightning appeared out of a clear sky and struck him.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The lightning seared everyone's eyes. Three consecutive bolts of thunder, like divine punishment, struck the Jiao Dragon King without fail.</p><p>When the lightning dissipated, the Jiao Dragon King was scarred and bleeding, his body lying limp on the sea of clouds, his eyes devoid of arrogance, filled only with profound despair.</p><p>Witnessing the pitiful state of this fearsome demon, a deep sense of awe filled the hearts of the onlookers.</p><p>"Besides you, who else was involved?" Qin Sang finally spoke, her tone calm, not like she was interrogating a criminal.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King's spirit was completely broken.  He just wanted to die quickly.  Like a living corpse, he replied, "King Golden Toad, King Phoenix, King Blood Pig, King White-headed Eagle…"</p><p>It was like the Yama King calling out names.</p><p>With each name the Jiao Dragon King uttered, someone among the Yaohai Sea Clan paled, and another chain shot from the clouds.</p><p>The Phoenix King was the first to suffer. The chain arrived instantly.</p><p>The chain's speed was terrifying. The Phoenix King, desperate, opened her mouth to speak, but it was too late.  In her terror, a brilliant multicolored light erupted behind her, revealing the shadow of a phoenix.  She tilted her head back, instantly transforming into her true form and spreading her wings to take flight.</p><p>But the chain carried a terrible oppressive force.  The Phoenix King's mind was assaulted, her body froze, and she felt searing pain as the chain bound her, dragging her down to the Jiao Dragon King.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>One by one, the demon kings were bundled and thrown down, utterly humiliated.</p><p>Only Yuan Zhu remained composed, sighing inwardly.</p><p>"Great Real Person, please allow me to speak!"</p><p>The Phoenix King, unable to struggle, cried out, "I was not the mastermind! The masterminds were the Jiao Dragon King and the Golden Toad King. I only learned about it after the fact; the situation was irreversible, and I dared not disobey.  I could only submit.  Please, Great Real Person, understand!"</p><p>Her plea was effective. Qin Sang didn't take the Jiao Dragon King's word at face value.  After further investigation, she identified the masterminds.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at Huang Wang and the other demons, delivering his judgment:  “Your crimes are grave. While you were not the masterminds, your punishment will be severe. You are all demoted to demon soldiers, a warning to others!”</p><p>With a sweep of his sleeve, he scattered talismans that flew into the foreheads of Huang Wang and the others.  None dared resist as the talismans embedded themselves, instantly binding their bodies. From that moment on, their lives were no longer their own.</p><p>The chains retracted, and the demons remained motionless.</p><p>Seeing these mighty demons prostrate before the peak of Qingyang Temple, trembling without a trace of their former pride, the onlookers felt both pity and fear.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his interrogation of the Jiao Long King: “Beyond the Demon Sea, who else was your accomplice?”</p><p>“We sought an alliance with Yu Wang and Long Jing Sheng Wang, but they refused. However, our dispatched forces secretly returned to the Demon Sea.  This couldn't have been hidden from the East Sea Lord; it must have been with his tacit approval…”</p><p>All eyes turned to the East Sea Lord's seat. Long Jing's face turned ashen; he never expected this old Jiao Long to implicate him even in death.</p><p>“Lies!”</p><p>Long Jing slammed the table, then flinched as two sharp gazes pierced him, sending a chill down his spine.</p><p>“You truly know nothing?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Under Qin Sang's piercing gaze, Long Jing's carefully prepared excuses failed him. He fell to his knees: “Great Daoist Master, I did indeed notice some unusual signs, but I didn't deliberately conceal them.  Uncertain of the Jiao Long King's intentions, and as the Lord of the East Sea, I had to proceed cautiously.  Premature action could have triggered a disastrous split in the Storm Realm. During the North Sea catastrophe, my hesitation prevented timely reinforcements, a grave mistake for which I accept full responsibility!”</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized Long Jing: “Your words leave much unexplained, but considering your lack of collusion with the Jiao Long King, redemption is possible.  You too are demoted to a demon soldier; your future actions will determine your fate.”</p><p>Long Jing trembled, letting out a final sigh of a fallen hero as he watched the talisman enter his body, joining his subordinates as a demon soldier.</p><p>Qin Sang judged actions, not intentions, and left Yu Wang alone. Regardless of Yu Wang’s dealings with the Jiao Long King, both the Demon Realm and North Sea stood together against the Changyou invasion, showing no retreat.</p><p>After this decisive series of blows, only the North Sea Demon Realm remained intact.</p><p>Just as everyone thought the matter was concluded, Qin Sang turned to the Hong surname cultivator: “Besides the East Sea demons, who else knew?”</p><p>“Tian Hao Tower, Elder Fan!”</p><p>The Hong surname cultivator's answer caused another uproar.</p><p>The Three Teach Alliance cultivators panicked. Tian Hao Tower's seats were on the far right of the Three Sects, with the Kūróng and Fán elders sitting side-by-side in the main seats.</p><p>Elder Fán reacted swiftly, transforming into a wisp of black smoke and fleeing towards the mountain's edge.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A lightning bolt struck the smoke.  Surprisingly, a stone statue tumbled out.</p><p>Elder Fán, anticipating danger, had sent only a puppet in his place.</p><p>Qin Sang smirked, looking towards the sky. A streak of light descended, revealing Elder Fán himself.</p><p>Elder Fán was immobile, his eyes filled with terror. His answers to Qin Sang’s questions caused an even greater disturbance.</p><p>All stared at the Three Teach Alliance in disbelief. They had known about the demons' collusion with the enemy but had deliberately convened the Central State sects, stalling for time.</p><p>Qin Sang uttered four words:  “Their hearts deserve death!”</p><p>The three sect masters reacted differently.</p><p>Master Xing Ren clasped his hands and chanted a Buddhist prayer.</p><p>Master Yin Ci and several monks knelt: “We, your unworthy disciples, have disgraced our sect. Please, Abbot, allow us to die.”</p><p>They knew their complicity meant certain death. Only by taking responsibility could they protect the Abbot and their sect.  In truth, Master Xing Ren hadn't directly orchestrated it; he had merely hinted at it before his seclusion, leaving a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Master Xing Ren gently touched Master Yin Ci’s head. The light in Master Yin Ci’s eyes faded.</p><p>“I shall purge all who colluded with the demons, and give an account to the Great Daoist Master and all present. As Abbot, I bear the responsibility and willingly relinquish my position.  I beg the Great Daoist Master to spare my life, that I may atone by undergoing self-reflection and, should our enemies return, fight and die in battle!”</p><p>Master Qi Shen stepped forward, kowtowing before Master Hegao, then turned to Qin Sang:  “We colluded with demons, committing a great crime. We deserve death, but please do not punish our sect.”</p><p>Having spoken, Master Qi Shen, bleeding from the mouth, took his own life.</p><p>Master Hegao sighed:  “My sect has brought shame upon itself. I have nothing to say. I leave my fate to the Great Daoist Master’s judgment!”</p><p>Kūróng Elder’s face was grim, silent, offering no defense for Elder Fán, his thoughts unreadable.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Elder Fán erupted in crazed laughter filled with hatred: “Kūróng, you think you can survive now that I'm dead? Who was it who introduced Hong to me all those years ago?”</p><p>Knowing his death was certain, Elder Fán, disregarding his sect’s future, bit back at Kūróng Elder.</p><p>With the sect master and Grand Elder dead, and their deaths mutually accusatory, Tian Hao Tower would likely shatter.</p><p>At that moment, the same thought occurred to everyone.</p><p>The Three Teach Alliance was finished.</p><p>Tian Hao Tower was finished.</p>
