Chapter 1881: Breaking the Ranks


The Divine Chariot of Heavenly Inspection, surveying all the gods!

His origins exposed by Tianyue Shangren, the golden dragon seemed to sense something, letting out an excited roar.

The sound shook the Divine Court!

However, no matter how earth-shattering the dragon's roar, it couldn't compare to the shock Tianyue Shangren's words brought to Qin Sang.

Tianyue Shangren!

Helping him reach the Void Refinement stage?

Qin Sang couldn't suppress the shock in his heart.

Judging by Tianyue Shangren's tone, he had long since seen through his identity and origins.

When had he been exposed?

Qin Sang couldn't judge Tianyue Shangren's cultivation level from a mere phantom, but it was definitely not at the mid-stage of Deity Transformation.

He hadn't felt this unfathomable aura even when facing Zuo Zhenren.

He had a premonition that Tianyue Shangren's power might exceed his imagination!

If Tianyue Shangren had fallen into this realm before him, and they met by chance, Tianyue Shangren might have deduced that he also came from the North Star Realm of the Storm Realm through his cultivation techniques and Dao arts.  But why did he say he came at someone else's behest?

Who was that person?

Was their first encounter in Star Valley, and their reunion in the Ghostfang Kingdom, all a carefully orchestrated plan, lying in wait for him?

What was their purpose?

Why did Tianyue Shangren approach him in this way?

Hua Ling, the *Venomous Deity Classic*, the Adamantine Fruit…

Li Hou, the Holy Fox King, and even the self-crippled Lingyou Wang.

Those rare opportunities, those perfectly matched opponents, had made his cultivation and comprehension of the Slaughter Dao incredibly smooth, almost as if everything was arranged for him.

How much of it was tailored for him?

Perhaps there was no Adamantine Bodhi Tree in the Jushan Administrative Altar at all, and it was just a ploy to lure him out of his cave dwelling and into danger.

The Adamantine Fruit had once appeared in the North Star Realm. Tianyue Shangren must have entered the Ziwei Palace, and with his strength, obtaining a few Adamantine Fruits wouldn't be strange.

But how did he know that he would definitely risk taking the Adamantine Fruit?

No wonder the Dao Court had always opened its doors wide for him.

Dharma treasures, spirit materials, refining techniques, as long as he had a suitable reason, they never made things difficult, granting him whatever he asked for.

He didn't know how many of the True People he had befriended were aware of the situation and had been playing along with him.

How many people had unknowingly become pawns of the mighty beings during this time!

It was laughable that he had always thought he was hiding so well.

Qin Sang felt his scalp tingle.

Too many questions assaulted his mind, and the feeling Qin Sang had now was not of honor, but of fear!

The only comfort was that at least Tianyue Shangren hadn't harmed him before, but had instead guided him several times on the path of the sword.

With Tianyue Shangren's strength, if he wanted to harm him, there was no need to go to such lengths.

Qin Sang opened his mouth, but then saw Tianyue Shangren's expression change slightly. He glanced towards the depths of the sea of clouds, then shifted his gaze back, sweeping over the Divine Chariot beneath Qin Sang, and said sternly, "I will transmit a seal to you. Quickly control the chariot!  I and the two True Monarchs cannot look after you. Within the Divine Court, relying on the chariot, you should be able to contend with those Demon Kings for a while…"

Before he finished speaking, Tianyue Shangren's phantom gradually faded, leaving behind an extraordinarily complex talismanic seal.

"Senior…"

Qin Sang's words died on his lips.  Before him was empty space. Seeing the talismanic seal dissipating, he quickly focused and memorized it.

For a moment, Qin Sang was utterly bewildered, unable to sort out his thoughts.

What were Tianyue Shangren and the True Monarchs going to do? Shouldn't they come in as soon as possible? Why should he contend with the Demon Kings?

At this moment, Qin Sang noticed that the surrounding clouds and scenery were rapidly receding. Only then did he realize that the golden dragon hadn't stopped running.

The golden dragon pulled the Taiyi Star Chariot, galloping through the sea of clouds.  Clearly, the thing that attracted the golden dragon was still in the depths of the Divine Court.

Where were the Demon Kings?

Tianyue Shangren's warning still echoed in his ears. Qin Sang didn't dare to underestimate it and looked in the direction Tianyue Shangren had glanced at earlier.

Qin Sang didn't know what that part of the sea of clouds was.  Even when he used his Heavenly Eye divine ability with all his might, he could only see a profound void.

At first, there was nothing unusual.

Suddenly, waves surged in the sea of clouds, the clouds billowing upwards, covering the sky and earth, forming a vast and mighty tide of clouds.

Amidst the churning clouds, pillars of Qi suddenly shot out, as if coming from beyond the heavens, intruding into the Divine Court. They were multicolored, with hues of green, red, black…

Even from here, Qin Sang could sense the astonishing demonic Qi emanating from those pillars!

Among them were the auras of Demon Kings, definitely not comparable to a self-crippled Demon King like Lingyou Wang.

Demons had entered the Divine Court first, and among them were Demon Kings at their peak strength!

Qin Sang vaguely felt gazes fixed upon him from that direction, and he was startled, finally realizing how perilous his current situation was.

'Roar!'

The dragon's roars grew increasingly excited.

Qin Sang immersed his entire mind into the Divine Chariot of Heavenly Inspection.

He could perceive the golden dragon's 'emotions'.  He still couldn't communicate with it, but it wasn't as resistant to him as it had been outside the Divine Court.

The talismanic seal surfaced in his mind, and Qin Sang didn't dare to hesitate, exhausting all his effort to comprehend it.

…

Ghostfang Kingdom.

Great Sage Mansion.

This place was actually one of the Four Auxiliary Administrative Altars of the Dao Court, the administrative altar of Gangshan. The altar was filled with golden halls, presenting a magnificent spectacle with no sense of impurity.

Just looking at the surface, it was hard to believe that this place had already been occupied by demons.

The true Great Sage's cave dwelling was actually just a stone cave located at the peak of a celestial mountain.

'Boom!'

The mountain shook, and amidst the deafening roar, a terrifying power erupted from within the celestial mountain.  The mountain collapsed, and countless rocks flew everywhere.

In the next moment, the part of the mountain above the halfway point was completely destroyed, revealing a high altar, and numerous figures.

The man in the dragon robe and imperial crown stood up. The figures around him also noticed the change in the moon, standing up one by one, gazing at the night sky with uncertainty.

"The Divine Court?"

The man in the dragon robe was the Demon Sage.

Surprise flashed in his eyes as well.

The plot to seize the fragmented map of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons was his handiwork. He knew better than anyone that the Southern Heavenly Gate in the Jushan Administrative Altar was fake.

The true Divine Court had actually appeared, right on the moon, a place everyone could see every night!

The Demon Sage turned his head to look westward. Even now, the Dao Court showed no unusual activity.

"Could it truly be an accident, catching the Dao Court off guard as well?"

This thought flashed through the Demon Sage's mind, but he didn't feel excited because of it. He knew very well the consequences of the Divine Court's sudden appearance.

Moreover, he felt a faint unease.  The reality might not be as simple as it appeared!

The True Monarchs of the Dao Court hadn't made a move yet, which further intensified this unease.

'Swish!'

The Demon Sage's gaze shifted to the fragmented map of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons, his eyes flashing brightly.

"Where are the Demon Gods!"

His shout reverberated throughout the Great Sage Mansion.

Figures immediately rose from the foot of the mountain, hurrying towards the high altar, their expressions filled with apprehension and shock.

Among them were those with low cultivation, far from transforming, but there were also Demon Marquises.

Even among the figures sitting around the high altar, some stepped forward.

These were all Demon Kings of the Ghostfang Kingdom, overlords of their respective domains. They had previously assisted the Great Sage in comprehending the fragmented map and deducing the Divine Dao.

The summoned demon cultivators had all switched to the Divine Dao and had already merged with the Divine Guardians within the fragmented map of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons. They were all carefully selected by the Great Sage, shrewd, capable, and exceptionally talented.

While deducing the new Divine Dao, they were also using the fragmented map of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons to comprehend the old Divine Dao of the Dao Court.

The Ghostfang Kingdom had deep ties with the Dao Court, and their deduction progressed rapidly.  In just a few decades, some Demon Kings had successfully merged with Divine Guardians.

"Demon Gods, enter the Heavenly Prisons!"

The Demon Sage swept his gaze over the Demon Gods, waving his large hand. The fragmented map of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons swelled against the wind, and Primordial Chaos Qi surged outwards, flooding towards the Demon Gods.

The Demon Gods didn't dare to resist, being engulfed by the Primordial Chaos Qi, transforming into streaks of light as they plunged into the Heavenly Prisons.

At the same time, the Demon Sage raised his right hand and abruptly struck out with a palm.

An illusory palm shadow flew out, golden light flashing in its palm, transforming rapidly, instantly forming a golden seal.

The golden light was dazzling, making it impossible to see the inscription on the golden seal. It flashed and flew into the Heavenly Prisons, merging with the Primordial Chaos Qi.

'Boom!'

The Heavenly Prisons trembled violently, suddenly erupting with a beam of Primordial Chaos light, as thick as a mountain, soaring straight into the sky.

At this moment, the Demon Sage and the other demons all felt that this beam of Primordial Chaos light had touched an unknown existence, connecting it to the Heavenly Prisons.

"Quickly enter the Divine Court and seize it! The Daoists will become our prey!  Establish unparalleled merit, and I, the Great Sage, promise you a position in the River Chart Hierarchy!"

The Demon Sage roared fiercely, promising great rewards.

The Divine Dao was established by the Dao Court, and the River Chart Hierarchy corresponded to the True Monarchs of the River Chart Dharma Positions, equivalent to the Great Sages of the demon race.

In the past, the Demon Sage couldn't make such a promise.

Now that the Divine Court had appeared, he could sense that the Gangshan Administrative Seal was gradually restoring its connection to the Divine Court, and there would be no more limitations in the future!

'Roar! Roar! Roar!'

Excited roars came from the Heavenly Prisons, and streaks of light soared towards the sky along that beam of Primordial Chaos light.

Then came screams of agony.

The Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons were, after all, only a fragmented map, barely connecting to the Divine Court.  Forcibly entering would inevitably subject them to terrible pressure. Those with weaker cultivation were instantly erased from existence, and less than ten percent successfully entered the Divine Court.

The Demon Sage coldly watched the Heavenly Prisons, his expression unmoved. With a wave of his sleeve, a golden hall in the mountain surged with purple light.

The purple light shot into the air, revealing a large drum, suspended in the center of the administrative altar. It was the Ghostfang Kingdom's supreme treasure, the Demon Summoning Drum!

Without any visible action from the Demon Sage, purple light flickered on the Demon Summoning Drum, and a drumbeat sounded.

Unlike the drumbeat at the Jushan Administrative Altar, this one sounded very muffled, carrying an unsettling tone.

Hearing the drumbeat, the surrounding Demon Kings all adopted solemn expressions.

Within the Ghostfang Kingdom, all the Demon King Mansions, Demon Marquis Mansions, and even the Demon Commanders' mansions, all sounded the chimes of bells and tripods.

At this moment, chaos erupted throughout the kingdom.

The demon cultivators all recalled an ancient legend. Once this drumbeat sounded, it signified that the Ghostfang Kingdom was facing a life-or-death crisis.

The entire kingdom, sharing the same fate, would fight with everything they had against external enemies!

Shock, fear, confusion, panic…

All sorts of negative emotions spread throughout the Ghostfang Kingdom, but this was the Great Sage's decree, and the demon cultivators dared not disobey.

The Demon Commanders immediately emerged from the mountains, gathering their subordinate demon soldiers and setting off.

Beacons of light lit up within the demon cities, and small teleportation formations were activated regardless of the cost of spirit stones. Squads of elite soldiers and powerful generals either rushed towards the Yellow Springs Path or gathered from the Demon Marquis Mansions to the Demon King Mansions, converging at the Great Sage Mansion.

Blood soon flowed like rivers in the Yellow Springs Path, as the army charged recklessly towards the Daoists.

The Demon Sage's gaze burned intensely as he stared westward, ignoring the chaos caused by the drumbeat. He stomped heavily beneath his feet.

'Boom!'

As his foot landed in the void, the celestial mountain trembled violently.

Beams of golden light burst forth from the surrounding golden halls, giving birth to towering golden pillars.

Each golden pillar was carved with coiling dragons. The dragons were lifelike, their scales shimmering gold. A closer look revealed that the patterns on each scale were unique, resembling talismans.

A total of one hundred and eight golden pillars stood tall above the Great Sage Mansion, forming a profound formation.

With countless demon soldiers and this golden pillar formation, even without the Demon Sage personally guarding the Great Sage Mansion, the Dao Court wouldn't be able to easily seize the Demon Summoning Drum!

Having completed these preparations, the Demon Sage let out a long howl and suddenly transformed into a ball of golden light.

In the next moment, a five-clawed golden dragon appeared within the golden light, clad in scales, with dragon horns atop its head.

Thunder rumbled in the sky, as if accompanied by wind and thunder, appearing even more majestic than the dragon pulling the chariot.

The dragon's eyes swept across.

Meeting that fierce gaze, all the Demon Kings' hearts tightened.  Only then did they awaken from the series of events.

"Beat the Demon Summoning Drum with all your might! Without my command, do not stop!"

His voice rolled like thunder.

The Demon Kings were shocked and dismayed upon hearing this.

The Demon Summoning Drum had always been a national treasure that deterred the Dao Court. Even in its most perilous moments, the Ghostfang Kingdom had never beaten it with full force.

Did the Great Sage intend to fight to the death, attracting endless ferocious beasts, and perish together with the Dao Court?

'Dong!'

Purple light stung the eyes of the demons. A drumbeat resonated with a strange rhythm, spreading out from the Ghostfang Kingdom, reaching the Sinister Wasteland, the Sinister Sea…

The five-clawed golden dragon swung its tail with all its might, smashing it heavily against the drum surface. Then, its body leaped upwards, coiling around the fragmented map of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons, and soared into the sky.

…

Sinister Wasteland.

The roars of beasts echoed through the mountains and wilds, mixed with strange howls, as waves of terrifying auras surged outwards, incredibly violent.

Dark, oppressive demon clouds filled the sky above the Sinister Wasteland.

…

Sinister Sea.

The wind and clouds churned.

Giant waves rose on the sea, and countless shadows rushed out of the water, forming a terrifying storm, heading straight for the coast.

…

Tianyue Shangren ascended, treading the void.

What had communicated with Qin Sang before was only a strand of divine intent he had forcibly sent in. His true body was still outside.

He looked at the bright moon in the sky.

The Lunar Palace seemed both incredibly far and incredibly near.

His steps appeared slow, but each one could cross vast distances.

'Dong!'

The drumbeat shook the heavens.

Tianyue Shangren had reached the edge of the lunar halo. He lowered his eyes slightly, extended his right hand, and said softly, "Sword, come!"

'Zheng!'

A sword cry suddenly rang out from Swordheart Island.

A beam of sword light split the cave dwelling and soared into the sky, arriving before the Sword-Wielding True Person, revealing the sword's form.

'Bang!'

The treasured sword hung upside down, and the rune-inscribed cloth strips wrapped around it suddenly snapped, revealing an ancient and simple divine sword.  Inscribed on the sword were the ancient characters 'Breaking the Ranks'!

As if a seal had been broken, divine light flowed over the sword's surface.

Tianyue Shangren reached out and grasped the divine sword. The sword vibrated slightly, but he held it firmly.

With a flick of his wrist, the divine sword trembled, splitting into two sword shadows.

'Swish!'

The sword shadows slashed through the air.

One slashed towards the demon clouds of the Sinister Wasteland.

One slashed towards the storm of the Sinister Sea.

At this moment, the five-clawed golden dragon arrived, carrying the fragmented map of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons.

Seeing Tianyue Shangren, its pupils constricted sharply, and it roared furiously, "Who are you, daring to obstruct me!"

Tianyue Shangren was unafraid of the Demon Sage's fierce aura.  He stepped into the lunar halo and stood before the dais of the Southern Heavenly Gate.

He couldn't enter the Divine Court, but he stood guard before it.

Standing with his sword at the Southern Heavenly Gate!

"Those who dare trespass upon the Divine Court, die!"
