<h1>Chapter 1716: The Yokai War</h1><p>Somewhere in the East Sea.</p><p>The normally calm sea surface here is strangely distorted, inexplicably sinking inward.  The water seems to fall down, creating a circular pit surrounded on all sides.</p><p>But at the center of the pit, a stream of water continuously gushes forth, like a bubbling spring, flowing upwards, its highest point even surpassing the sea level.</p><p>Sunlight reflecting on the water reveals the silhouettes of lush green forests, as if a dry, waterless world exists deep within the pit, surreal and dreamlike.</p><p>This peculiar place is known as the Shui Yi Sacred Ground amongst the East Sea Yokai.</p><p>The entrance to the Shui Yi Sacred Ground is that central stream; one can enter the inner sanctum by leaping from its highest point, if unimpeded.</p><p>Since its discovery, the Shui Yi Sacred Ground, due to the incredibly valuable treasures within, has always been under ownership, though the owner frequently changes.</p><p>Naturally, it's not lacking in restrictions and guards.</p><p>Currently, the master of the Shui Yi Sacred Ground is the Qinghu Saint King, and its guards are all demon soldiers from the Saint King's Palace.</p><p>Just as the floating shadows outside suggest, the inside of the Shui Yi Sacred Ground is a large expanse of land, covered in dense forest. Looking up from within the forest, one sees a blue dome of seawater, making this place resemble a submerged island.</p><p>The jungle is thick.</p><p>There are no man-made structures in the forest, nor any human figures.  The guards remain at the edge of the forest, not daring to cross the line.</p><p>Oddly, whether it's day or night outside, a pale blue light continuously shines down, with no variation in brightness.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>A bright light flashes from the waterway.</p><p>The guards raise their weapons, their expressions grim. Then, a silver, circular scale floats in.</p><p>The commander, a transformed great demon, raises his webbed hand to receive the scale.  A white light emanates from his palm, enveloping the scale. After a moment, his expression softens, and he waves his arm behind him, personally opening the waterway.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The water flows apart to both sides.</p><p>A figure swiftly enters, a handsome young man, though his neck is covered in layers of scales, and his exposed hands are also covered in fine scales.</p><p>The young man is clearly an acquaintance of the commander; they exchange nods.</p><p>Noticing the question in the young man’s eyes, the commander nods and transmits a message: “Zishen Great Saint and Bai Xiao Great Saint are both in the Sacred Ground. Go and pay your respects.”</p><p>The young man seems relieved, bows slightly, and hurries away.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before he reaches the forest, a commanding voice calls out, “What is your hurry?”</p><p>The young man stops abruptly at the forest's edge, bows from a distance, holds up an object, and says gravely, “Reporting to the Great Saint, a confidential message has arrived!”</p><p>In his palm, a red light flickers, sometimes taking the form of a red fish, sometimes a scroll, constantly shifting.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The red light automatically flies into the forest.</p><p>The young man stands still, not daring to move.</p><p>In the forest.</p><p>Two figures sit on either side of a pool.</p><p>If Qin Sang were here, he would instantly recognize them – both are his acquaintances, and he has clashed with both.</p><p>One is the Green-haired Rat Yokai who once infiltrated the Liuzhou Hall treasure exchange disguised as a man in green armor, known as the Zishen Great Saint amongst the Yokai.</p><p>The other is the lord of the Bai Ming Mountain, the Bai Xiao Great Saint.</p><p>Both demons are leading generals under the Qinghu Saint King.  With the constant external conflicts, they are both waiting beside this pool, seemingly for something within the pool to emerge.</p><p>Zishen Great Saint no longer wears the armor that concealed his demonic aura. He’s wearing a heavy suit of armor, its dark surface covered in intricate patterns that appear to be bone carvings.</p><p>He stares at the pool, calculating with his fingers, “Once these Shui Yi Essences mature, I’ll take half.  That will be enough.  Giving up the Shui Yi Sacred Ground is acceptable.”</p><p>Shui Yi Crystals are the most precious treasures of the Shui Yi Sacred Ground, greatly beneficial to Yokai cultivation. However, the East Sea Yokai have yet to determine their origin; only this sacred ground produces them.</p><p>“It’s fortunate that those fellows aren't competing. With the Saint King’s previous rewards, I’ve almost collected enough,” Bai Xiao Great Saint chuckled.</p><p>Years ago, he let the Fire Demon escape, failing the Saint King’s order, and he’d been anxious, fearing Qinghu Saint King's wrath.</p><p>Only recently has he regained his jovial mood.</p><p>Zishen Great Saint scoffs, “Black Lion's got his eyes on Li Hanchuan. The Li Shui Ming Sand found there is even more valuable than the Shui Yi Crystals!”</p><p>“With the situation so chaotic, we shouldn't worry about minor details.”</p><p>Before the powerful clans uncover the truth about the Saint King's Palace, the priority is to quickly gather treasures.  Once these rich lands fall back into the hands of those clans, it will be much harder for us to seize them," Bai Xiao the Great Saint said, glancing sideways. A red fish flew through the woods and landed in his hand.</p><p>Zi Shen the Great Saint became more subdued, ceasing his argument.  Bai Xiao the Great Saint commanded the demon kings of Bai Ming Mountain; while not as powerful as the major clans, they still constituted a significant force. However, after the loss of his two closest aides, he felt weaker than Bai Xiao.</p><p>Since the other side held this opinion, he couldn't be overly arrogant. He looked at Bai Xiao, noticing the other's furrowed brow after reading the secret message.</p><p>"What's happened?" Zi Shen pressed.</p><p>"Rebellion activity..." Bai Xiao replied, his expression unusual. He tossed the red fish to Zi Shen.</p><p>This was a secret message from a spy within the Dragon Whale clan. Planting spies within the Dragon Whales was incredibly difficult; only highly reliable and vital information would risk exposure for transmission.</p><p>After reading the message, Zi Shen's face also changed.</p><p>"They dare launch a full-scale attack so soon! That Dragon Whale has gone mad!"</p><p>Wars in the immortal cultivation world rarely ended quickly; they often dragged on for hundreds, even thousands of years.  Though Dragon Whale the Great Saint showed disloyalty, the situation was still in its probing stage.  Other clans leaned toward him, but most were watching and waiting, wary of the Qing Hu Saint King.</p><p>The Saint King's Palace knew this, patiently maneuvering while secretly looting everything of value.  But unexpectedly, a major complication arose.</p><p>Strange occurrences always have strange reasons!</p><p>Bai Xiao mused, "That old fox Dragon Whale is cunning. He may have some secret method, or he's found out something. Otherwise, even with Dragon Whale's audacity, the other clans' shrewd leaders wouldn't risk everything. The Saint King's suppression of the entire Water Monkey clan still echoes!"</p><p>"Send a message to Black Lion, prepare quickly.  Movement among the clans will soon show. Regardless, before the Shui Yi Crystal matures, we must not show weakness…"</p><p>Zi Shen rose and paced by the pool, suddenly asking, "Do you think the Saint King is still in this realm?  I wonder what treasures she obtained at the Wuwang Hall and the Wuxiang Immortal Gate, or if that old monk slandered her, leading to her ascension before a century passed."</p><p>"The Saint King always kept her word.  You know her nature! Soon after the hunt, she withdrew from worldly affairs. I sent messengers to Ganlu Zen Temple several times, receiving no reply.  Since she explicitly told us to manage ourselves, even if the Saint King's Palace is razed, she wouldn't interfere."</p><p>Bai Xiao shook his head, offering no hope.  In fact, the Saint King's followers were numerous. Even without Qing Hu, the Saint King's Palace was a top power in the East Sea.</p><p>But Qing Hu was always capricious; she had killed and robbed many demon clans. Without a powerful cultivator present, the East Sea clans would surely destroy the Saint King's Palace.</p><p>Two fists can't fight four hands, especially with the Dragon Whale clan. No demon king would willingly be a sacrifice. With chaos emerging, everyone was seeking their own path.</p><p>The two Great Saints discussed further, left trusted subordinates to guard the Shui Yi Holy Land, and then departed separately.</p><p>…</p><p>Since Qin Sang's appearance, the East Sea has become increasingly turbulent. The East Sea demon clans engaged in several major battles. Dragon Whale the Great Saint gained the upper hand, the Saint King's Palace faltered, retreating step by step, without a trace of its former glory.</p><p>In the vast ocean, beneath the surface, a school of millions of arrowfish followed the currents. Seen from above, it looked like a giant creature swimming beneath the surface.</p><p>These were common arrowfish, usually unnoticed.  Among them, one arrowfish was indistinguishable from the others, yet its eyes held a special intelligence, mixed with anxiety. It dared not move, following the school obediently.</p><p>Miles behind the fish, a dark cloud carrying demonic winds broke the ocean's calm, pressing down.  Closer inspection revealed that the cloud was a swarm of demonic beasts: shrimp soldiers, crab generals, fish and turtle officers, and various strange creatures. Despite their diversity, their formation was orderly.</p><p>Most striking was a group of pure white, winged beasts resembling celestial horses. Their form was agile, their bearing contrasting sharply with the chaotic swarm—the renowned Four-Winged Celestial Steeds, a powerful clan of the East Sea.</p><p>On a flying chariot, two similar-looking middle-aged men in white robes sat.</p><p>"Brother, why didn't you let our men capture that scout?" the lower-ranked man asked, frowning.</p><p>One man, holding a jade fan and wearing an imperial crown, smiled upon hearing this: "Let him go back and spread the news. Then he will know that our Divine Horse clan was coerced by the Dragon Whale, deliberately slowing our advance."</p><p>His brother suddenly understood, "Brother, you want the Dragon Whale to scout the Royal Palace first?"</p><p>"Exactly," the man in the imperial crown lightly shook his jade fan, "Now that several clans have mobilized, dividing our forces into five routes, we have surrounded the Royal Palace army. If the Qinghu Saint King doesn't appear, it will be a complete rout, and the Royal Palace will fall. Whether the Saint King is present or not will be determined by this battle!"</p><p>His brother hummed, "I didn't expect that the Dragon Whale would be willing to pay such a huge price and resolutely use the clan's sacred bone! If the Qinghu Saint King truly ascends, our side will certainly win this battle. If the Saint King takes action, even with the sacred bone, the Dragon Whale can still hold its own against her. We can immediately retreat to our ancestral land; it's still possible.  But…"</p><p>He hesitated, a wary look flashing in his eyes, "The Qinghu Saint King has a violent temper.  Once, because the Water Monkey clan's tribute of spirits was insufficient, she annihilated their entire clan…"</p><p>Before he could finish, the man in the imperial crown interrupted, "Back then, we didn't know the Saint King's temperament. Our clans weren't united, and we couldn't work together; she took advantage of that. Now, all clans have suffered greatly under the oppression of the Royal Palace, deprived of the right to share the sacred treasures.  They harbor resentment and have suffered for a long time. If that weren't the case, how could the Dragon Whale have rallied so many followers?  In this moment of shared adversity, we rely on each other, with the ancestral lands at our backs. We don't fear the Qinghu Saint King's revenge. At worst, we endure more humiliation; she can't stay in this world forever, can she?"</p><p>His brother nodded, "Brother is right. Even if we retreat, the treasures we seize from the sacred land will make this war worthwhile."</p><p>As they spoke, the group of monsters crossed a vast expanse of sea.</p><p>During their advance, reports poured in from all sides.</p><p>As time passed, the joy on the two men's faces grew stronger.</p><p>The fastest, the Dragon Whale Great Sage, was almost catching up with the enemy forces. The Royal Palace army was shrinking, hesitant to fight to the death—it didn't look like the Saint King was there.</p><p>Of course, it could also be a ploy to lure the enemy.</p><p>But the one leading the charge was the Dragon Whale Great Sage; what did it matter to them?</p><p>…</p><p>The sky was clear, the sun high, yet this sea area was unusually dark and filled with a sense of killing.</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>The sea churned violently.</p><p>Hurricane winds swept across the heavens, and demonic energy soared into the sky.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage stood on the back of a whale shark, his muscles bulging, his right hand gripping a chain connected to an iron cage.</p><p>The black cloth on the cage was lifted, revealing blood-soaked bones. The intense blood-red light was strikingly conspicuous on the battlefield, exhibiting terrifying ferocity.</p><p>Ninety-nine Dragon Whales undulated around him, their blood energy surging, like blood-red whales, emitting shrill roars, ready to explode their bodies and become one with the sacred bone.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage's eyes widened as he stared ahead.</p><p>He could already see the tail end of the Royal Palace army. According to the agreement, the encirclement and slaughter should begin after an incense stick’s time.</p><p>The Royal Palace army, with the Royal Palace at its back, was formidable even without the Saint King, and the Dragon Whale clan alone could not annihilate them.</p><p>However, the news from other directions indicated that, except for his trusted subordinates, the speed of the other groups had slowed down to varying degrees, each offering various excuses.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage sneered; he knew what those fellows were thinking.</p><p>However, his boldness in launching this decisive battle wasn't due to these allies, but to one person!</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage glanced sideways, seeing the figure standing on the back of a Dragon Whale beside him.</p><p>This person hadn't been there a moment before, appearing suddenly.</p><p>Dressed in Daoist robes, with an ethereal demeanor, he stood with his hands behind his back, out of place on the battlefield, just a few feet behind the Great Sage.</p><p>But in the entire army, except for the Dragon Whale Great Sage, no other demon king noticed his presence.</p><p>Even the Dragon Whale Great Sage only perceived him after he approached, through the sacred bone.</p><p>Although the Dragon Whale Great Sage had deliberately left a passage for him in the demon formation, his uncanny ability to appear and disappear made the Dragon Whale Great Sage secretly alarmed, thinking that the cunning fox had finally met its match.</p><p>"What instruction does the True Monarch have?"</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage bowed slightly, asking softly.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and said, "This Daoist has secretly toured the area and did not sense the Qinghu Saint King's aura.  You may rest assured and hunt down the Royal Palace army; this Daoist will help you break their formation."</p><p>"If the Qinghu Saint King appears on the battlefield, how confident is the True Monarch in killing her?"</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage was ambitious.  If he paid a heavy price to use the sacred object, he wasn't satisfied with just seizing the Royal Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, saying nothing.  His eyes flickered, and his figure vanished in an instant.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage drew everyone's attention, allowing him to secretly investigate.  All signs indicated that the Qinghu Saint King was likely no longer there, or at least not in the East Sea.</p><p>He was using the inter-demon conflict to test his hypothesis, hoping to overthrow the Royal Palace and seize its treasury.</p>
