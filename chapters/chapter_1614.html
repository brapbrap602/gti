<h1>Chapter 1605: Hearing the Dao</h1><p>Ghost Mother was enraged.</p><p>Qin Sang讪讪.</p><p>Ever since the Fat Silkworm was captured, Qin Sang had tried feeding it various spirit medicines, but only 'poisons' suited its appetite and brought about improvement. Qin Sang naturally assumed it was a venomous insect.</p><p>In fact, the Fat Silkworm's abilities had always been related to poison neutralization. The pearl born after its fourth transformation only had the ability to devour poisons, with no further changes.</p><p>He still remembered that he had caught the Fat Silkworm in a poisonous swamp, originally intending to capture the Rainbow Ringed Giant Earthworm.</p><p>Afterwards, the Fat Silkworm swallowed the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, molting and awakening its poison-neutralizing aura, and it had come this far. It was likely related to its growth environment; it could only blame itself for developing incorrectly.</p><p>"Fortunately, it's only at the early stage of the fourth transformation, just entered the Dao, and can still be corrected. Otherwise, if you continue to cultivate it like this, such a good bloodline would be wasted!"</p><p>Ghost Mother stared at the Fat Silkworm, lost in thought.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm curled into a ball, trembling, and looked at Qin Sang with pleading eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have time for it.</p><p>Two words from Ghost Mother's words caught his attention.</p><p>"Entered the Dao?"</p><p>"You don't know?"</p><p>Ghost Mother was still considering the Fat Silkworm's situation. She let out an "Oh" and casually explained, "The inheritance of this realm is incomplete... Cultivators, especially you human cultivators, guide primordial essence to establish the foundation, then embrace yin and yang, condensing all essence into a Golden Core, refining a sliver of True Nature, which is the foundation of achieving the Dao. Nascent Soul is the beginning of entering the Dao. I observe that most current cultivators are Dharma Cultivators, thus entering the Dao through Qi. Of course, we have far more choices than spirit insects. There are still opportunities to choose later. The Dao of spirit insects is purer than ours, their path is fixed, and unless they encounter a transformative opportunity, it's difficult to change."</p><p>"Entering the Dao through Qi?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then continued to ask, "What about Spirit Cultivators? Body Cultivators? How do they enter the Dao?"</p><p>"Spirit Cultivators enter the Dao through their Primordial Spirit, Body Cultivators temper their Primordial Essence. Demon Cultivators mostly follow this path... Of course, most paths eventually converge. To reach the Body Integration Realm in the future, one must achieve harmony of essence, qi, and spirit, then there's a chance to merge with the Dao."</p><p>Ghost Mother was completely unaware of the immense shock her words brought to Qin Sang. It was equivalent to illuminating his path forward, pointing directly towards the Great Dao of Body Integration!</p><p>Bai had mentioned these things before, but his memory was fragmented, he couldn't explain it clearly, only saying that Qin Sang should persist in cultivating essence, qi, and spirit, and it would definitely be greatly beneficial in the future.</p><p>"The Nascent Soul, Deity Transformation, and Void Refinement Realms, do they refer to the process of merging with the Dao?"</p><p>Qin Sang learned the secrets of Body Integration for the first time, and combined with his previous thoughts, he finally understood.</p><p>No wonder hunting Corpse Kings didn't yield Nascent Souls, but Corpse Soul Pearls. Demon Cultivators, after transforming into human form, also didn't have Nascent Souls, but continued to refine their Demon Cores.</p><p>Because they are all condensed Primordial Essence!</p><p>Ghost Mother didn't notice Qin Sang's strangeness, continuing滔滔不觉, "Indeed! To be precise, it's a path explored by your human Dharma Cultivators, refining essence into qi, entering the Dao through qi, then using this as a guide, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit back to emptiness, and ultimately merging with the Dao. But it doesn't apply to everyone. The paths of Spirit Cultivators and Body Cultivators are not entirely the same as Dharma Cultivators, and there are also vast differences among Dharma Cultivators. The names of the realms shouldn't be the same, but because Dharma Cultivators dominate the current world, the names of Nascent Soul, Deity Transformation, and Void Refinement have become mainstream."</p><p>"How do Ghost Cultivators merge with the Dao?" Qin Sang still didn't quite understand and quickly asked.</p><p>Ghost Cultivators only have soul bodies.</p><p>Ghost Mother looked at him strangely. "After Ghost Cultivators achieve Nascent Soul, some condense their own physical bodies, while others refine new ones... I said 'most people' just now, because this path to merging with the Dao is the most common, most cultivation methods and divine abilities can be forcibly categorized into this. The other part are special existences, which are not few in the entire cultivation world. There are pure Body Cultivators, and there are Ghost Cultivators who follow their path to the end, and they might also have the possibility of merging with the Dao. There are even many Great Daos you've never heard of, which don't cultivate the self, but can still achieve great divine abilities no less than the Body Integration stage! The vast world is full of wonders, far richer and more diverse than you imagine. Being trapped in this realm limits your vision..."</p><p>"Is the opportunity to breakthrough to Deity Transformation related to the Primordial Spirit?" Qin Sang mused.</p><p>So, his forceful cultivation of the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus," aiming for a breakthrough in divine sense first, had inadvertently led him down the right path.</p><p>Ghost Mother countered, "Not quite, it's not as simple as you think. Breaking through realms is about getting closer to the Heavenly Dao, an overall sublimation of oneself. Without understanding the principles, even a strong divine sense is just raw power. Don't forget you entered the Dao through Qi, your Nascent Soul is the core... Of course, a strong Primordial Spirit is certainly beneficial for comprehending the Great Dao."</p><p>Qin Sang respectfully asked for guidance, "Senior, please advise, what should this junior do?"</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>Ghost Mother shook her head frankly.</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>She understood the Body Integration Realm, but not Deity Transformation?</p><p>Ghost Mother shifted her gaze from the Fat Silkworm, glanced at Ya Gu, and said to Qin Sang, "However, I can point you to a place where you might obtain a Deity Transformation relic. How much opportunity you can gain depends on your luck."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang calmed down from the surprise of hearing the Dao.</p><p>As expected, there's no such thing as a free lunch.</p><p>Ghost Mother wasn't giving him all this guidance for nothing, but had other motives!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned slightly serious. He looked at the Fat Silkworm, then at Ya Gu, and said in a deep voice, "Senior, what do you want from this junior?"</p><p>"To be able to cultivate to the late Nascent Soul stage in this realm, you are indeed astute, saving this Palace much effort," Ghost Mother placed the Fat Silkworm on Ya Gu, looking down carefully, "She has been well protected by you. Although it will take some effort, there is a great hope of awakening her. Once she recovers, I want to take her with me."</p><p>Qin Sang initially thought Ghost Mother had taken a fancy to the Fat Silkworm, but unexpectedly, she wanted to take Ya Gu as well.</p><p>Take her as a disciple?</p><p>Or was there another scheme?</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Ghost Mother.</p><p>Ghost Mother asked strangely, "Do you not want to part with her? Since she's not your lover, have you ever considered how she will cope after she awakens?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless for a moment.</p><p>When Ya Gu first fell into slumber, his thoughts were simple: awaken her, then find a safe and prosperous place to settle her, allowing her to live a peaceful life.</p><p>If he failed, he would bury Ya Gu.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome, he would do his best and not betray his conscience.</p><p>Who would have thought that Ya Gu would sleep for five hundred years.</p><p>For five hundred years, Qin Sang had become accustomed to having her by his side, and the obsession with awakening her had become a habit.</p><p>From the Cang Lang Sea to the North Star Region, then to the Three Northern Seas, and finally to the Central Continent, hope turned into disappointment time and again. Now, Qin Sang only wished to awaken her, unable to consider more.</p><p>"I can see your ambition. You are certainly not content to stop at the Nascent Soul stage. The Great Dao is arduous, you can't always bring her along. How will you settle her? Her natal Gu Insect has advanced to the fourth transformation, cultivation will be much easier after she awakens, but it's not instantaneous. To catch up to you is even more of a pipe dream!"</p><p>Ghost Mother pointed to herself, "I can guide her. Do you understand the Great Dao of the Witch Clan?"</p><p>Qin Sang said in a deep voice, "Senior, do you want to take her as your disciple?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe she was simply looking for a successor.</p><p>Unless this person was nearing the end of her lifespan, she definitely had ulterior motives towards Ya Gu!</p><p>Ghost Mother knew she couldn't hide it from Qin Sang, so she laid everything out.</p><p>"Back then, after I awoke, I was trapped in the restriction beneath the Pure Sea Sect. After escaping, I was nearly extinguished, with only my soul body remaining.  I failed to find my kin in the Three Northern Seas, so I had to refine a random physical body."</p><p>Refine or possess?</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes turned cold.</p><p>Ghost Mother didn't seem to notice Qin Sang's gaze and continued, "After recovering some of my strength, I crossed the storm belt to the North Star Region. My purpose in going to the North Star Region was twofold: one, to find my kin, and two, to find the Demon Clan's Sacred Altar!"</p><p>Demon Clan's Sacred Altar?</p><p>Could it be the Ascension Platform?</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, remaining calm and collected, not interrupting Ghost Mother.</p><p>"You know what happened afterward. I was targeted by a sword maniac, trapped in the Abyssal Ruins, later rescued by Tan Hao, returned to the Three Northern Seas to recover my cultivation using the methods I left behind, and came to the Central Continent."</p><p>"Was Grandmaster Tian Yue already at the Deity Transformation stage back then?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>The strength Ghost Mother displayed was very strong, and it was unknown how many hidden methods she still possessed. At the Nascent Soul realm, she was definitely among the top echelon.</p><p>To defeat Ghost Mother and even imprison her, nearly causing her death, probably only a Deity Transformation cultivator could do it.</p><p>Ghost Mother became enraged, "That little Tian Yue was self-righteous and wouldn't listen to my good advice. He took advantage of my weakened state and used despicable methods. It was not a fair fight!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was a bit strange. He inwardly mocked that if Ghost Mother had been as sarcastic towards Tian Yue as she was just now, being thoroughly beaten would have been entirely deserved.</p><p>"It cannot be denied that he is one of the top figures in this era. Barring unforeseen circumstances, he has definitely reached Deity Transformation already."</p><p>Ghost Mother did not belittle Grandmaster Tian Yue because of their enmity, and continued her story, "Although the Central Continent is vast, there is no place for my clan to establish themselves. I learned that there is another realm west of the Central Continent, the Western Lands. The environment of the Western Lands is harsh, mortals suffer, and they revere Buddhism and Daoism. I still haven't found any trace of my clan's inheritance. However, after searching for many years in the Western Lands, I finally found a clue... A Deity Transformation cultivator from the Witch Clan had once been to the Western Lands!"</p><p>Ghost Mother stared at Qin Sang as she spoke, suspecting that Ya Gu and the Deity Transformation Witch Clan cultivator came from the same place.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>If the Deity Transformation Witch Clan cultivator came from the Cang Lang Sea, it must have been before the rise of the Four Saints.</p><p>Since the rise of the human race, the Witch Clan had retreated to the Witch God Continent, declining day by day, and had never produced another Deity Transformation cultivator. If not for the Demon Sea diverting the human race's energy and easing the conflict between the two races, the Witch Clan would have been even worse off.</p><p>"I followed the footsteps of the Witch Clan Deity Transformation cultivator and returned. Unexpectedly, various signs indicated that this person might have ultimately perished in the Central Continent."</p><p>Ghost Mother sighed, "The place I mentioned is most likely where he fell."</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but ask, "Senior, why have you traveled the world, sparing no effort to search for your kin?"</p><p>Ghost Mother calmly replied, "I want to return."</p><p>"Return?"</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback, "Return to where?"</p><p>"I don't know," Ghost Mother shook her head, "After awakening, I had a clear thought in my mind. The way to return is simple: find the descendants of my clan, construct a ritual altar, invoke the power of my clan's bloodline, and there will be guidance from the other shore. At that time, using her physical body as a vessel, I will traverse the void!"</p><p>Yet, Ghost Mother landed in the human realm.</p><p>The simplest method became the most difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened, "Using a physical body as a vessel to traverse the void! Is this another way to ascend?"</p><p>"Ascend?"</p><p>Ghost Mother chuckled disdainfully, "Oh, I forgot this small thousand world is special, nearly destroyed! It's truly not easy for cultivators in this realm to escape this cage. Calling it 'ascension' does make some sense."</p><p>"What does Senior mean by this? What is a small thousand world?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked repeatedly, feeling that he was about to touch upon the core secrets of the world.</p><p>"There are great thousand worlds, those are the vast worlds where countless cultivators strive and contend, full of wonders. Within a great thousand world, countless small thousand worlds can evolve. Each small thousand world may give birth to life, and some are controlled by others, becoming cave heavens and blessed lands... I suspect that this is a small thousand world."</p><p>Ghost Mother paused, looking up at the vast night sky, her gaze profound, "The Heavenly Dao of a small thousand world is incomplete. Depending on the degree of its evolution, the difficulty of cultivation for cultivators varies. After breaking through the corresponding realm and reaching the limit of the small thousand world, they will perceive the location of the small thousand world's Dao Marker. Following this perception, cultivators can pass through the Dao Marker's gate and enter the great thousand world, which is what you call 'ascension'."</p><p>After Deity Transformation, one knows their destination!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly recalled Xiao Xiang Zi's prophecy.</p><p>So that's how it is!</p><p>The Deity Transformation stage is the limit of this realm. Only by breaking through to Deity Transformation can cultivators in this realm sense the Dao Marker's gate and 'ascend' to the great thousand world!</p><p>Then, Ghost Mother scoffed, "Of course, this is just my rough judgment. There are many legends that shouldn't exist in this realm, it must be the most special one among small thousand worlds, with too many mysteries I can't fathom. If there is a Dao Marker's gate, it must be hidden deep within the storm belt, having undergone an unknown transformation. We cannot reach it, and even Deity Transformation cultivators probably can't easily arrive there."</p><p>"So, Deity Transformation cultivators in the Central Continent all have to stay in this realm for a long time. Perhaps the Eight Sceneries Palace and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery hold the safe path to the Dao Marker's gate, which is why other Deity Transformation cultivators compromise..."</p><p>Qin Sang extrapolated.</p><p>The various strange phenomena in the Central Continent, his previous doubts, finally had an explanation.</p><p>However, new questions immediately followed, "Senior, you've spent hundreds of years searching for your kin. Why not try to break through to the Deity Transformation stage first and enter the great thousand world through the Dao Marker's gate? Wouldn't it be easier to find your kin there?"</p><p>Ghost Mother had been slumbering since ancient times and possessed an extraordinarily long lifespan.</p><p>Her cultivation before being trapped was definitely more than just Deity Transformation.</p><p>The Demon Monarch of the Seven Slaughters Hall was a case in point.</p><p>In that case, it should be much easier for her to recover to Deity Transformation compared to their younger generation.</p><p>"It's not that I don't want to, but I can't."</p><p>Ghost Mother shook her head gently, also somewhat puzzled, "I've tried countless times, but the Deity Transformation bottleneck is incredibly solid, like cast iron, as if my Dao has been severed. I don't know if I've lost something, or... if I've been subjected to an invisible seal. I must return to find the answer."</p><p>Sealing an ancient cultivator at the Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't imagine such divine power.</p><p>He still remembered that on the Ascension Platform, the Jade Bone Devil Lord also couldn't wait to recover his cultivation and ascended impatiently. Could it be that he was also sealed?</p><p>But why was the Demon Monarch of the Seven Slaughters Hall an exception?</p><p>There were too many things Qin Sang couldn't understand. He didn't care about secrets anymore, desperately seeking answers, "Is the Demon Lord's Sacred Altar the Ascension Platform? I once witnessed an ancient devil activate the Ascension Platform, open a spatial passage, and leave this realm!"</p><p>"Oh? There are still ancient devils surviving in the North Star Region."</p><p>Ghost Mother nodded, "I searched for the Demon Clan's Sacred Altar back then only as a backup plan. I wouldn't take that path unless absolutely necessary."</p><p>She paused, then asked Qin Sang, "The great thousand world is not unique. Since it's a Demon Clan's Sacred Altar, where do you think it leads to?"</p>
