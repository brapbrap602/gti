Chapter 400: Perseverance


The further they went, the more shocking the scene became.
The ice beneath their feet began to crack.
At first, the cracks were small, just thin fissures winding through the ice, hard to spot unless you looked closely.
Gradually, more and more cracks appeared, densely packed like a spiderweb, spreading deep into the ice cave.  These were clearly new cracks, raising concerns about the cave's stability.
The glacial ice in the cave, ancient and incredibly hard, had endured countless years.
Honestly, without using magical artifacts, Qin Sang doubted she could inflict this much damage. The heart of the battle lay ahead, but what had happened?
What kind of enemy had Yun Youzi encountered?
‘Boom!’
Again.
The vibrations were irregular.
Sometimes several in quick succession, sometimes a long time between them.
Suddenly, Qin Sang stopped, staring ahead in surprise.
Before her, in the heart of the blizzard, was an ice sculpture.  A person was encased within it, their back to her.
Yun Youzi!
Even from the back, Qin Sang recognized him instantly.  Yun Youzi was here, frozen into an ice statue.
His body was completely encased in ice, yet he stood firm within the ice cave, like an old pine rooted in the ice, his spine straight, facing the raging blizzard.
Layer upon layer of snow and ice accumulated, the ice growing thicker.
Yun Youzi stood motionless.
There was no sign of the ancient beast she expected. The vibrations shaking the ice cave originated further ahead.
However, Yun Youzi's condition was extremely precarious.
There was a complete absence of life around Yun Youzi; she couldn’t sense his presence at all!
Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, about to rush forward.
At that moment, a faint ‘crack’ echoed – a tiny sound almost imperceptible in the wind and snow, audible only to Qin Sang’s keen hearing.
The sound came from the ice encasing Yun Youzi.
Intrigued, Qin Sang paused, looking down at Yun Youzi's left leg.
Yun Youzi wasn't standing with his feet together; his left foot was half a step ahead of his right.  The moment the sound occurred, a flicker of spiritual energy, a faint, greenish light, pulsed in his legs, causing the ice to crack from within.
Unfortunately, the ice didn’t shatter. The cracks appeared and were immediately refrozen by the relentless blizzard, leaving only faint lines.
That explained the numerous crisscrossing cracks on his body.
Yun Youzi hadn't given up. His inner spiritual energy pulsed weakly, again and again, finally shattering the ice around his leg. Seizing the opportunity, Yun Youzi moved, taking a large step forward with his left foot, his body leaning slightly.
He tried to move his right foot, but it was frozen again.
His body was contorted in an odd pose: his left leg far ahead, his upper body straight and unyielding to the pressure of the blizzard.
This step seemed to have cost him dearly; Yun Youzi didn't continue.
He remained in this position, gathering strength, waiting to take the next step.
Qin Sang silently approached from behind, finally seeing Yun Youzi's face.
His expression was impassive, his eyes closed, his white hair and beard frozen into stiff icicles. He looked like a lifelike ice sculpture.
Only a faint wisp of his life force indicated he was still alive, still persevering.
A flawless pearl floated before his forehead.
A small green lamp glowed on his chest.
Qin Sang immediately realized that Yun Youzi was using the flawless pearl to protect his soul from the terrible cold, and the lamp functioned much like the Red Pill.
However, Yun Youzi was expending all his energy, relying on the flawless pearl to withstand the cold, making it difficult for him to maintain the lamp.
The lamp's flame was extremely weak, almost invisible to the naked eye, flickering on the verge of extinction.
Keeping the lamp burning was a Herculean effort, barely enough to prevent Yun Youzi's body from freezing solid, but doing nothing to slow the growing thickness of the ice around him.
Yun Youzi hadn’t given up; he was steadily gathering strength.
The green flame that had shattered the ice earlier was a testament to his efforts, one step at a time, until he reached this point.
Yun Youzi could no longer spare his attention to anything else; his eyes were closed, his entire focus on the flawless pearl and the lamp, driven only by his unwavering determination.
Qin Sang reached Yun Youzi's side.  In the distance ahead and to the left, through the blizzard, she could vaguely make out a flower-like ice crystal swaying on the ice wall.
It was a lily.


A Heavenly Treasure: Nightfall Lily

It thrived in the icy wastes, its leaves and stem prostrate on the ice, becoming one with the frozen landscape.  Its blossoms were as crystalline as the ice itself, yet appeared incredibly fragile, making one worry they might shatter at the slightest touch.  Despite this harsh environment, the Nightfall Lily bloomed, proud and aloof.  Like a fairy of the ice and snow, it stood alone in the world.

Gale-force winds and blizzards howled, with the power to destroy all things, yet parted automatically around the Nightfall Lily, as if unwilling to disturb it.

Qin Sang looked closely and discovered a protective array surrounding the flower.  This array, she surmised, was left by the cultivator who first discovered the Nightfall Lily, safeguarding its growth until maturity.  The array not only shielded it from the blizzards, but also sealed the lily's aura within, preventing its blossoming from attracting predatory beasts.

For some reason, that cultivator never returned to harvest the mature Nightfall Lily.

‘Crack!’

Yun Youzi, having gathered more strength, tried again.  Unfortunately, this attempt was too brief; he only moved his right foot a short distance, less than half a step.

He paused, preparing again.  His face showed no frustration, urgency, anxiety, or despair, only serenity.  Beneath this calm lay a power that was truly awe-inspiring.

Yun Youzi focused on his inner strength, driven by his determination, single-mindedly intent.  His gaze fixed on the Nightfall Lily, he exerted every ounce of his remaining energy, inching forward, unaware of Qin Sang beside him.

Qin Sang silently watched Yun Youzi before moving past him to the Nightfall Lily, carefully observing it.  Her gaze lightly scanned the flower, her attention mainly on the protective array.

Good. The Nightfall Lily's protective array was not a fearsome killing formation; its primary function was concealment.  For a cultivator who had managed to reach this place, breaking the array would not be overly difficult.

Qin Sang turned to watch Yun Youzi take another step.  The ice encasing him grew thicker.

This short distance felt like an insurmountable chasm to Yun Youzi. The further he went, the more terrifying the wind became, and Yun Youzi was nearing exhaustion. Qin Sang doubted he could continue much further.  The chances were slim.

Often, sheer willpower alone is insufficient to achieve one's desires.
