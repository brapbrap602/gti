<h1>Chapter 1791: Fierce Battle</h1><p>The distant mountains resembled dark eyebrows.</p><p>The earth was a scene of verdant green.</p><p>Within the forest, myriad trees competed for glory, towering ancient trees thick enough to require dozens of people to embrace were everywhere.</p><p>A stream meandered, threading its way through the forest, its banks adorned with lush grass and vibrant blossoms, a picture of thriving life.</p><p>The only imperfection was the utter silence.</p><p>The sound of wind, the chirping of insects, the cries of birds and beasts—all were absent.</p><p>No sound meant no living creatures.  Without wind, the vegetation remained motionless.</p><p>This was a rare haven of peace within Mount Juzhi's Altar, but the vast jungle exuded a strange, deathly stillness, like a realistic painting sketched onto the void. To be within it evoked not only tranquility, but also a sense of dread.</p><p>This tranquility had been shattered.</p><p>Yet, this space remained remarkably stable, the jungle only trembling slightly.</p><p>Above the jungle was a richly colored azure sky, where azure winds seemed to accumulate, forming a thick celestial wall interspersed with faint golden light.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A fissure ripped open in the azure sky, torn apart from the outside, and a meteor plummeted from the heights.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The meteor descended with terrifying speed, crashing directly into the jungle, causing immense destruction.</p><p>The shockwave radiated outwards, causing the treetops to undulate in layers of green waves.</p><p>At the impact site, thick trees were splintered, ancient trees toppled, leaving a scene of utter devastation, and a human-shaped crater appeared in the ground.</p><p>Immediately after, light flickered within the crater, and with a swoosh, a figure shot out, looking upwards with an unsettled expression.</p><p>The fissure in the sky slowly closed, but a figure leisurely stepped out from within, none other than Li Hou.</p><p>The one who had been struck down was, naturally, Qin Sang, whom Li Hou had been relentlessly pursuing.</p><p>“Giving up on running?”</p><p>Li Hou strode through the air, approaching gracefully, a playful glint in his eyes.</p><p>He first scanned the space, his expression cautious, and finding nothing unusual, he nodded inwardly.</p><p>He hadn't expected such a secure location to exist within Mount Juzhi's Altar.</p><p>This was undoubtedly a perfect hunting ground for a decisive kill; this fellow had actually found himself an excellent burial site!</p><p>Outside, he had to be wary of various unforeseen impacts, unable to unleash his full power, and his opponent could use these to evade his attacks, which was irritating.</p><p>Otherwise, Li Hou believed he would have already captured his prey.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, his voice laced with anger and defiance.</p><p>He raised his right arm, revealing torn robes and three ghastly claw marks on his skin.</p><p>Similar wounds covered his body.</p><p>Although his robes were a magical treasure, they couldn't withstand Li Hou's sharp claws and were now in tatters.</p><p>The claw marks tore through his skin, exposing red flesh, but they hadn't reached the bone.</p><p>Firstly, Li Hou hadn't had the chance to strike with full force, and secondly, Qin Sang had constantly circulated the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal for protection, akin to wearing golden armor.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang had relied solely on the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal to directly withstand the attacks of a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Previously, when hunting the Thunder Turtle and the Wood Jiao, one was injured and the other had allies, allowing Qin Sang to remain unfazed, using the Seal only to deflect residual energy.</p><p>Now, having tested it, he found that every direct hit significantly depleted his physical essence, but its power hadn't disappointed him.</p><p>Combined with the Celestial Eye Butterfly's Shifting Divine Light, Qin Sang felt confident he could confront Li Hou's claws head-on without resorting to other protective treasures or techniques.</p><p>This boosted his confidence further.</p><p>Most importantly, upon entering this space, Qin Sang immediately sensed abundant Wood Spiritual Qi, the very treasure land he had been desperately searching for!</p><p>Vital energy surged towards his wounds, instantly staunching the bleeding, and the claw marks gradually closed.</p><p>He stared intently at Li Hou with a desperate resolve, but wasn't eager to unleash his Spirit Wood Body.</p><p>Li Hou wasn't like the Thunder Turtle or the Wood Jiao; as a Demon Marquis, his intelligence, decisiveness, and magical powers far surpassed those of savage beasts.  If the situation turned unfavorable, he would flee.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal wasn't merely to defeat his opponent, but to seize the opportunity to kill him!</p><p>If he could bring back the corpse of a mid-Nascent Soul Demon Marquis, not only would it earn him promotion, but he could also demand more from the Celestial Court.</p><p>Dealing with such an opponent required strategy.</p><p>Of course, this was just a preliminary plan; if it proved impossible, he would try to shake off Li Hou and seek other targets.</p><p>Stared at with wolf-like eyes, Li Hou remained unperturbed, licking his lips with a greedy expression.</p><p>To humans, a demon beast was a treasure trove.</p><p>The reverse was also true.</p><p>The Celestial Court and the Ghost Tribe had been at a stalemate for a long time, and even as a Demon Marquis, he hadn't yet savored the delicacy of a Profound Clarity cultivator.</p><p>The only thing that puzzled Li Hou was Qin Sang's wings.</p><p>Those Multi-Character Phoenix Wings looked incredibly real, not like a magical treasure, but as if they had grown from Qin Sang's body. The Thunder Escape technique he employed with every flap seemed like his innate magical power.</p><p>This was indeed the case.  Qin Sang was only using the wings' inherent Thunder Escape technique, which now only consumed physical essence. He hadn't channeled Azure Phoenix Thunder Force using his True Essence because he didn't want to reveal his dual cultivation of both physical body and magical arts.</p><p>With the breakthrough to the fifth level of the *Celestial Demon Transformation*, his Phoenix Wings had also undergone a transformation, enhancing his Thunder Escape technique, making it a top-tier escape method even without the Azure Phoenix Thunder Force.</p><p>“This Marquis wants to see just how tough your hide is!”</p><p>A sharp shriek echoed as Li Hou vanished into thin air.</p><p>The earth beneath Qin Sang suddenly churned violently, sending up waves of mud, wreaking havoc on the surrounding jungle.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>…</p><p>Countless trees snapped and fell, the hard ground transformed into a mire, instantly swallowed by the mud waves.</p><p>In an instant, a thousand-zhang radius around Qin Sang became a swamp, and a void appeared in the center, directly beneath him.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately sensed something amiss. A tremendous suction force erupted from the void, locking onto him.</p><p>‘Crack, crack, crack…’</p><p>Qin Sang's muscles tensed, his bones cracked, as he stood firm in the air, resisting the pull of the void. However, this distorted his movements, preventing him from immediately escaping.</p><p>Silently, a claw the size of a baby's fist appeared above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>The claw had only three fingers, its black nails slightly curved like sharp knives, aimed directly at his crown, plunging downwards!</p><p>If it connected, Qin Sang's head would be instantly pierced.</p><p>With the Celestial Eye Butterfly on alert, Qin Sang didn't even lift his head.  The moment the claw appeared, he detected it, raising both arms and striking with the Demon Subduing Seal, meeting the claw head-on.</p><p>A metallic clang resonated as Qin Sang was struck with tremendous force, his body plummeting. He twisted slightly mid-air, dissipating the force, and flew off at an angle, narrowly avoiding the void.</p><p>Above him, a peculiar demonic beast materialized.</p><p>The beast resembled a badger, only the height of a child, its entire body black, covered in fine scales from head to tail.</p><p>Even its small eyes were protected by scales, leaving no vulnerability when closed.</p><p>“Gale Badger!”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, recognizing the beast. Li Hou was a cultivated Gale Badger.</p><p>Unfortunately, information about Gale Badgers was scarce, and Qin Sang didn't know its bloodline magical powers. However, judging by Li Hou's previous actions, it seemed related to earth manipulation.</p><p>Having revealed his true form, Li Hou's eyes darted around, fixated on Qin Sang's palms.</p><p>Three bloody claw marks now adorned Qin Sang's palms, but they weren't seriously injured, healing quickly with a circulation of vital energy.</p><p>Li Hou displayed a human-like expression of surprise. He had revealed his true form with the intention of a swift victory.</p><p>His demonic form was stronger than his human form, yet that claw hadn't crippled Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, this was the result of the Shifting Divine Light combined with the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that the Shifting Divine Light not only weakened magical powers, but also dispersed Li Hou's incoming force.</p><p>He and the Celestial Eye Butterfly hadn't fully comprehended the Shifting Divine Light yet. His rudimentary understanding was that the divine light formed a smooth convex surface, and no matter how concentrated the force, upon contact with the convex surface, it would be dispersed due to the lack of a focal point.</p><p>Of course, it definitely wasn't that simple.</p><p>The dispersion of force was equivalent to weakening it. The power of a spirit insect's magical ability inherently surpassed that of demon cultivators and human cultivators of the same realm. Coupled with the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal, this explained his current performance.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed Li Hou's thoughts and sneered, feigning reconciliation, "There's no mortal enmity between us. We shouldn't interfere with each other. Why must Marquis Li Hou push things to extremes?"</p><p>Li Hou remained unmoved, his gaze fixed on Qin Sang's palms, his eyes darting rapidly.</p><p>Because the Shifting Divine Light was invisible and colorless, adhering to Qin Sang's body, it was impossible to discern with the naked eye.</p><p>He snorted, refusing to believe that an opponent of lower cultivation could possess defenses so formidable as to render him helpless.</p><p>Qin Sang caught a glimpse of a badger shadow from the corner of his eye and felt a chill.  He swung his arms outwards, the power of the Buddhist Seal forming a massive shadow.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>They clashed and separated instantly, Li Hou's true form reappearing on Qin Sang's other side.</p><p>In a single breath, countless badger shadows materialized around Qin Sang, trapping him, unable to move.</p><p>The badger shadows were in various poses, but their sharp claws all pointed towards Qin Sang's vital points.</p><p>A continuous 'bang, bang' resounded as Qin Sang spun almost incessantly, his palms striking out, his palm winds like thunder, shattering the badger shadows one after another.</p><p>The battle between man and demon raged, the dissipating force generating a gale, sweeping up mud and broken wood, forming a grey tornado that followed their movements, destroying everything in its path, carving deep trenches through the jungle.</p><p>Their figures were almost invisible within the heart of the tornado.</p><p>Suddenly, with a loud explosion, the tornado burst apart, debris polluting half the sky, mud raining down. Qin Sang crossed his arms in front of his chest, once again sent flying backwards.</p><p>But he still remained uninjured!</p><p>Li Hou looked down condescendingly, his battle intent surging.  He spread his claws, and a sphere of light appeared in each palm, transforming into two illusory images that enveloped his sharp claws.</p><p>In the next instant, a pair of gleaming claw gauntlets materialized on Li Hou's claws, fitting perfectly.</p><p>Demon cultivators disliked external objects, but that didn't mean they didn't know how to utilize external forces.</p><p>Seeing the claw gauntlets, Qin Sang's expression grew more serious. He knew these treasures were custom-made for Li Hou, their power undoubtedly formidable, at least at the pseudo-Spirit Treasure level. The Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal and the Shifting Divine Light might not be able to fully withstand them.</p><p>Without giving Qin Sang time to think, Li Hou closed in again, his sharp claws thrusting towards Qin Sang's chest.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly twisted his body, his Thunder Wings flapping rapidly.  Despite his contorted posture, his other actions remained unaffected. He struck out with both seals, combining hardness and softness, his force tightly entangling the claws, using the rebound to instantly propel himself a hundred zhang away.</p><p>But this alone couldn't stop Li Hou.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could regain his footing, another fierce attack came. He was forced to activate his Thunder Wings, desperately using the *Seven Masters Buddhist Seals* to evade Li Hou.</p><p>This time, the commotion of their exchange was less intense than before, but the danger was even greater.</p><p>A streak of lightning and a grey shadow clashed and separated repeatedly, battling from the sky to the ground and back again, the battlefield spanning almost half of the jungle space.</p><p>Gradually, a sense of astonishment arose within Li Hou.</p><p>He realized that although he could continuously suppress his opponent, his opponent's combat experience was incredibly rich. Relying on formidable escape techniques and defenses, he evaded what attacks he could, enduring those he couldn't, focusing on dodging the fatal blows from the sharp claws.</p><p>Yet Li Hou couldn't completely pin Qin Sang down.</p><p>It was important to note that his combat instincts stemmed from his bloodline, which carried the deep imprints of his ancestors. Even without experiencing life-or-death battles, his combat instincts were extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang's physical combat instincts were no less than his, perhaps even stronger, strong enough to bridge the gap in cultivation!</p><p>Li Hou had sparred with other Demon Marquises of Qin Sang's cultivation level. With his superior cultivation, channeling the might of heaven and earth, he could easily restrict his opponents, leaving few capable of withstanding such a relentless barrage of attacks.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed completely unaffected.</p><p>If not a demon cultivator, then he was a killing star forged through countless battles!</p><p>The potential of such a figure was unimaginable. Once fully grown, he would become a grave threat to the Ghost Tribe!</p><p>Li Hou didn't realize it was the effect of the Vajra Great Freedom Seal, but his killing intent towards Qin Sang intensified.</p><p>This person was strong, but only amongst his peers. Li Hou didn't consider Qin Sang a true match, as he had only been using his claws and claw gauntlets so far.</p><p>However, there was no need to go all out.</p><p>Li Hou had noticed that during their exchange, the techniques Qin Sang employed were immensely draining.  With each Thunder Escape and collision, his vital energy visibly declined, his essence rapidly depleting.</p><p>He was also expending energy, but Qin Sang's cultivation was lower, and his rate of consumption was faster.</p><p>He simply needed to relentlessly attack Qin Sang, and it wouldn't be long before he found an opening for an easy victory. Why not?</p><p>Thinking this, Li Hou slowed his assault.</p><p>At the same time, the earth rumbled, the entire jungle shaking violently.</p><p>The mud on the ground hardened into blocks, transforming into rock, then rising and contorting.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Numerous dark figures burst from the ground, pouncing on Qin Sang.</p><p>They were rock badgers, formed from the earth.</p><p>The rock badgers were shattered by Qin Sang before they could get close, sending dust flying.  The dust, instead of dispersing, solidified, transforming the void into a vast mire, trapping Qin Sang, unable to extricate himself.</p><p>Li Hou moved like a phantom within the earth, forcing Qin Sang to fully concentrate on defense, preventing his escape.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's continuously weakening aura, a cruel smile spread across Li Hou's face, though a hint of caution remained in his heart.</p><p>A cornered beast would still fight, let alone a Profound Clarity cultivator.</p><p>Dust filled the air, staining the celestial wall a murky yellow, growing increasingly dense.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Suddenly, the dust converged inwards, solidifying into rock.</p><p>Cracking sounds echoed as countless rocks encased Li Hou, like a stone armor. The small badger form transformed into a colossal stone beast nearly a hundred zhang tall, its fists like descending hammers, smashing fiercely forward.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A figure was slammed directly into the earth.</p><p>Li Hou emerged from the shattered armor, his expression freezing.</p><p>A giant tree emerged from the earth, supporting itself as it slowly rose, Wood Spiritual Qi surging towards it like a tide!</p>
