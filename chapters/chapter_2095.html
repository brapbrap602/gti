<h1>Chapter 2086: Little Brother</h1><p>Qingyang View, Stream Peak.</p><p>After Qin Li's breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment stage, he was granted a cave dwelling here. The new sect grounds were vast, and even with all the Qingyang View disciples residing within, it didn't feel crowded at all.</p><p>Following Little Fox's preferences, he built a hut on the southern slope of Stream Peak, by the river.  Secluded and with an unobstructed view of the distant mountains and rivers, breathtaking scenery unfolded before his eyes every morning.</p><p>One day, after being summoned by the Deacon, Qin Li returned to his hut and felt a sudden weight on his shoulder, followed by a sweet voice.</p><p>"Hey! What did the Deacon want?"</p><p>Little Fox was innately skilled in the art of遁术 (tunshu -  concealment and teleportation), appearing and disappearing as if by magic. While initially startled numerous times, Qin Li had grown accustomed to her sudden appearances.</p><p>He plopped down on the bluestone in front of the door and said, "Deacon Tan wants to take me to the North Sea."</p><p>"The North Sea? Are we going back to the ancestral grounds? Great, great! I miss home. I've been away from the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea for so long!"</p><p>Little Fox leaped to the ground, pacing excitedly in front of Qin Li.</p><p>Qin Li chuckled, "Deacon Tan said we're going to Wavecross Island.  I don't think that's part of the ancestral grounds."</p><p>"Wavecross Island?"</p><p>Little Fox froze, suddenly remembering something. Her fur stood on end as she shrieked, "Wavecross Island is a spiritual island in the outer North Sea! It's a military base! He's sending you to the battlefield!"</p><p>Qingyang View had recalled most of its disciples under the guise of establishing new sect grounds, but it still bore the responsibility of defending the realm.  Every so often, batches of disciples would be rotated to the front lines.</p><p>"Battlefield?"</p><p>Qin Li seemed dazed, not fully grasping the implications.</p><p>"Did you agree?"  Little Fox clutched his knee, standing up, her face etched with anxiety.</p><p>Qin Li scratched the back of his head. "Deacon Tan simply informed me. He didn't ask if I was willing."</p><p>"We're doomed, doomed, doomed…"</p><p>Little Fox deflated, dejectedly pacing, her anxiety growing with each step.  Qin Li was only at the early Foundation Establishment stage, and she herself was merely at the mid-stage Spirit Fox realm. The battlefield was frequented by mighty cultivators at the Deity Transformation stage.  If they went there, they wouldn't even be left with ashes.</p><p>She had chosen Qin Li, hoping to benefit from his connection, but instead of reaping rewards, she was about to be thrown into the abyss.</p><p>Little Fox spat out, "Couldn't you have refused?"</p><p>"Deacon Tan said it was the sect's decision, and Brother Chi and the others have all agreed," Qin Li said.</p><p>"What's their family name, and what's yours? You're a Qin! If you didn't want to go, who would dare force you to your death!"  Little Fox was practically beside herself with grief.</p><p>Qin Li's憨笑 (hanxiao - simple smile) suddenly vanished, replaced by a serious expression. "Ancestor said that precisely because we are of the Qin bloodline, with countless eyes within the sect watching us, we must always be at the forefront, upholding the Qin family's honor and living up to our ancestors' prestige!"</p><p>Little Fox glared at Qin Li with a look of utter exasperation, but mostly helplessness. After spending so much time with him, she knew his character well. He wasn't stupid, but sometimes he was incredibly naive, and there was no way to dissuade him.</p><p>She was bound to Qin Li and couldn't escape.  All she could do was rack her brains for a solution. "Did Deacon Tan mention which general you would be serving under?"</p><p>"The general Deacon Tan mentioned... his name sounded like Fifth Granduncle," Qin Li said uncertainly.</p><p>"A Qin Senior Master?"</p><p>Little Fox's eyes darted around, the worry instantly vanishing from her face, replaced by disdain. "I see.  They're sending you to earn merits!  Typical pampered young master, hmph…"</p><p>Little Fox shot Qin Li a contemptuous look and gracefully hopped into the bamboo basket hanging from the rafters.  The mountain breeze rustled through, gently swaying the basket.  Little Fox stretched languidly and quickly drifted off to sleep.</p><p>Several days later, Qin Li and a group of Qingyang View disciples boarded a flying vessel, leaving Qingyang View. They crossed the North Sea and were taken directly to Wavecross Island.</p><p>Upon landing, orders were issued, and the group was divided into several smaller units. That evening, someone led Qin Li's group away.</p><p>Standing on a plantain leaf-shaped magical artifact, and learning that they were being sent to a frontline encampment, Qin Li and Little Fox were still somewhat bewildered.  In the blink of an eye, they had been transported from the safety of their sect to a dangerous battlefield without even seeing the "Fifth Granduncle" Qin Li had mentioned.</p><p>They stood at the very back of the group.  Ahead of them were over a hundred other Qingyang View disciples, ranging in cultivation levels.  The highest among them was a Nascent Soul Senior Master, who was chatting and laughing with the person who had come to receive them.</p><p>Defending against the Longyou Clan was the duty of every cultivator in the Storm Realm, and it was also the best opportunity for practical experience.</p><p>Qi Refining disciples were too weak, but those at the Foundation Establishment stage were qualified to join the battlefield.  Qin Li was the lowest in cultivation amongst this group, and Little Fox, usually so lively, now huddled quietly in his arms.</p><p>The plantain leaf soared through the wind, traveling an unknown distance, before a lush green island appeared in the distance.  Shaped like a butterfly, the island shimmered with the glow of protective formations.</p><p>As they approached the island, the plantain leaf came to a sudden halt, and the person receiving them looked back.</p><p>This person was a battle-hardened veteran, his eyes carrying a chilling aura. Qin Li and the others felt a wave of fear wash over them under his gaze.</p><p>"Chi Wei Yong, Qin Li… step forward!"</p><p>He called out several names, all of them Foundation Establishment cultivators.  With a flick of his sleeve, Qin Li and the others felt their footing disappear and plummeted towards the ground, hastily summoning their flying artifacts.</p><p>"Don't panic! This is a good thing!"</p><p>Little Fox, the calmest among them, transmitted her voice. "This isn't the front lines.  If they have us guarding this island, it has to be safe!"</p><p>Qin Li fumbled, summoning a flying dagger beneath his feet. He wobbled unsteadily towards the ground.  A streak of light shot up from the island, and a martial-looking cultivator flew towards them.</p><p>Everyone noticed the token at his waist and felt a sense of awe.  Before coming here, they had crammed themselves with information and knew that the token signified rank. This person was the garrison commander of this island, and they would be serving under him.</p><p>Moreover, this garrison commander's aura clearly indicated he was a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>After the initial flurry of activity, the garrison commander gathered everyone.  Facing the Foundation Establishment cultivators, he showed no airs and said affably, "I am You Feng, and I have the honor of being the garrison commander of Butterfly Island.  It may take some time for you fellow Daoists to acclimate…"</p><p>Seeing that the garrison commander was easy to get along with, everyone relaxed.</p><p>You Feng appeared amiable, but his Golden Core pressure kept them respectful as they listened attentively to his explanation of their duties and the rules.</p><p>The day was spent on various trivial matters. They were settled in the left wing of Butterfly Island, each receiving their own barracks.  The barracks were connected but separated by formations, ensuring that they wouldn't disturb each other's cultivation.</p><p>Having time to cultivate on a battlefield was undoubtedly fortunate, and their tasks were indeed quite simple.  They were to patrol a few times a day and remain stationed on the island.  As long as they completed their daily tasks and didn't stray too far from Butterfly Island, the garrison commander wouldn't interfere with them.</p><p>"Quick!  Take them all out!"</p><p>Inside the barracks, Little Fox urged Qin Li excitedly.</p><p>Their harvest that day had been bountiful. In addition to special detection and warning artifacts, the garrison commander had also issued each of them a set of standard artifacts. Each one was at least of High-grade quality: offensive, defensive, flying, concealing, and even various specialized artifacts – they had it all. Even Little Fox received a set suitable for a demon cultivator.</p><p>Within their sect, such artifacts would require a substantial amount of merit points to exchange for, and even Qin Li wouldn't receive preferential treatment.</p><p>With artifacts spread out on the floor, Little Fox looked at this one, touched that one, rolling around excitedly amongst them.  She declared to Qin Li, "I told you, you're here to gild your reputation!"</p><p>After a night's rest, at daybreak, the garrison commander gathered a group for patrol duty outside the island, including Qin Li and Little Fox.</p><p>They were initially tense, Qin Li clenching his fists, not daring to relax for a moment. But after circling the island, they encountered no enemy presence.  All they saw was the azure sea, occasionally with seabirds flying overhead, peaceful and beautiful.</p><p>Everything was calm, and everyone gradually relaxed.</p><p>Returning to Butterfly Island, Qin Li was about to return to his barracks to cultivate, but Little Fox stopped him.</p><p>"Go outside the island?"</p><p>Qin Li hesitated at Little Fox's suggestion.  "It's too dangerous out there!"</p><p>"We just went that far, and there was no danger.  We'll just wander around near Butterfly Island, not straying too far..."</p><p>Little Fox urged him repeatedly, adding a seemingly sound reason, "If the enemy attacks, we'll need to know the terrain to know where to escape!"</p><p>Although he didn't agree with her talk of escape, Qin Li was eventually persuaded.  He summoned his flying artifact and headed out, and as expected, the garrison commander didn't stop them.</p><p>They first circled Butterfly Island, gradually venturing further out, admiring the scenery vastly different from the mainland. Little Fox sighed, "If only there were no enemies out there, how wonderful it would be!"</p><p>"Indeed," Qin Li agreed wholeheartedly, "But without external enemies, there would be internal strife."</p><p>"Eh?"  Little Fox tilted her head, looking at Qin Li with surprise. "Who taught you that?"</p><p>"I heard Deacon Tan say it once," Qin Li admitted honestly.</p><p>"I knew it couldn't have been your own epiphany!"</p><p>Little Fox scoffed and continued to enjoy the scenery.  A short while later, she seemed to sense something and let out another soft "Eh."  She leaped from Qin Li's shoulder, her paws swift as the wind, and dashed across the sea surface with incredible speed, quickly becoming nothing more than a white blur.</p><p>"Where are you going?"</p><p>Qin Li called out anxiously, but seeing Little Fox continue to fly away, he grew increasingly worried.</p><p>By the time he caught up, Little Fox finally slowed down.  Qin Li then noticed a fight taking place on the sea surface ahead.</p><p>Waves churned, ripples spreading outward.</p><p>Roars emanated from the center of the commotion, occasionally accompanied by flashes of gray light, sharp and menacing.</p><p>Little Fox hadn't concealed her aura, and the two combatants, sensing the uninvited guest, also restrained themselves somewhat.</p><p>Their figures emerged from the waves. One side was a human cultivator, the other a fish demon.</p><p>The fish demon had a mouthful of fangs and a ferocious appearance, its body covered in blood. The cultivator was a young man in gray robes, a gray flying sword hovering before him.</p><p>Neither side's cultivation was high. The fish demon was at the Mortal Demon stage, while the young man was a Qi Refining cultivator.</p><p>"Hey! Where did you come from?  This isn't a place for you! Leave quickly, uh…"</p><p>Little Fox, seeing the fish demon's miserable state, felt a surge of displeasure and wanted to shout at the young man to retreat. But then she noticed a token hanging from the young man's waist as well.</p><p>The fish demon sensed the aura of a Greater Demon emanating from Little Fox and dared not retaliate further, prostrating itself on the sea surface, trembling, and whimpering at Little Fox.</p><p>The young man recalled his flying sword and turned to look at them.</p><p>"Are you from Butterfly Island?" Little Fox landed in front of the young man and questioned him.</p><p>The young man nodded.</p><p>"Aren't there only Foundation Establishment cultivators here?" Little Fox asked, puzzled.</p><p>"I'm a rogue cultivator."</p><p>The young man replied indifferently.</p><p>Just then, Qin Li finally caught up, offering the young man an apologetic smile.  He whispered to Little Fox, "There are also Qi Refining Daoists on Butterfly Island, responsible for some miscellaneous tasks."</p><p>Little Fox understood and continued to scrutinize the young man, sighing, "Rogue cultivators sure have it rough!"</p><p>Having to fight on the battlefield at the Qi Refining stage, without a single decent artifact on him, his only flying sword looked dull and gray.  However, this fellow seemed to have a backbone, managing to maintain his composure in their presence.</p><p>Little Fox developed a bit of goodwill towards the young man and softened her tone. "Why are you killing demons here? Our enemy is the Longyou Clan. Humans and demons should be united against a common foe!"</p><p>The young man's tone remained impassive, "I'm practicing my swordsmanship."</p><p>"Practicing your swordsmanship?"</p><p>Little Fox snorted, "You'll have plenty of opportunities to practice your swordsmanship when you encounter the Longyou Clan!  Don't attack it anymore. Let it go. It has two children in its nest."</p><p>The young man wasn't lacking in opponents and nodded slightly, sheathing his sword.</p><p>Seeing that the young man was reasonable, Little Fox was quite satisfied. She waved her paw at the fish demon. "Go quickly!  Don't come to the surface again!"</p><p>The fish demon whimpered, sending up a spray of water as it flipped over and disappeared beneath the waves.</p><p>The young man turned to leave, his brow furrowing slightly before he felt a weight on his shoulder.  Little Fox, without a hint of hesitation, had jumped onto his shoulder.</p><p>"What's your name?"</p><p>"Jian Yi," the young man replied.</p><p>"Jian Yi? What a strange name!"</p><p>Little Fox patted his shoulder. "Don't be scared. We're all comrades. We won't harm you.  Call me Fox Immortal. From now on, you're our little brother. With us looking out for you, you'll be safe and sound!"</p><p>Jian Yi looked at Little Fox, then at Qin Li who had caught up.  After a moment's thought, he nodded and said, "Alright."</p><p>Qin Li was about to explain, but unexpectedly, Jian Yi had actually agreed.  He waved his hands repeatedly, "Brother, don't take it seriously. We're not taking on any little brothers.  From now on, we're all friends…"</p><p>Little Fox, however, wouldn't let it go.  She grabbed Jian Yi's collar and shouted, "Alright, what alright! You haven't called me Fox Immortal yet!"</p><p>…</p><p>Holybath Plains, Holy Lake.</p><p>Early one morning, the Longyou Clan elders in quiet meditation, the Holy Lake guards, and the servants in the various residences almost simultaneously heard a voice filled with authority.</p><p>"Everyone, leave Holy Lake before sunset!"</p><p>The elders were startled awake, then shocked.  "It's a decree from the Clan Leader!"</p><p>Including the Clan Leader's residence, all the residences were instantly thrown into chaos.  Fortunately, Min Shu stepped in to calm the situation and arrange for everyone's evacuation.</p><p>Then, the Holy Lake guards also retreated from the center of the lake.</p><p>Unable to find the Clan Leader, the elders could only seek out Min Shu, anxiously asking, "Third Young Master, what exactly has happened?"</p><p>This decree had caused widespread panic, with everyone assuming something had gone wrong with the Holy Lake.</p><p>Just then, the elders suddenly noticed that the center of the Holy Lake burst into a dazzling light, while the surroundings grew dim, as if the daylight had been instantly absorbed by the lake.</p><p>Within the blinding radiance, a figure appeared – Clan Leader Min Zhuo.</p><p>"Father is borrowing the power of the Holy Lake Grand Formation!"  Min Shu's voice was filled with suppressed excitement.</p><p>"Borrowing the power of the Grand Formation?  Could it be…"</p><p>The elders suddenly thought of a possibility, and their faces lit up with joy.</p>
