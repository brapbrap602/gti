<h1>Chapter 2253: Dream Realm</h1><p>“Thankfully, the voice hasn’t disappeared…”</p><p>Qin Sang hid in a mountain valley, setting up layer upon layer of powerful formations.  Without further hesitation, he began to cultivate.</p><p>At this moment, several glowing talismans were closest to Qin Sang, surrounded by three distinct layers of formation flags. Each flag possessed different powers; even with the triple-layered formations, Qin Sang remained uneasy.  He had also concealed several more formation artifacts nearby, ready to be activated to deal with various situations.</p><p>With everything prepared, Qin Sang responded.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>The moment he asked, the calling abruptly paused.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart tightened, immediately becoming alert. The other party had clearly 'heard' his response.</p><p>A deathly silence followed.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind remained taut, silently awaiting a reaction.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang heard a voice filled with shock.</p><p>“You can hear me!!!”</p><p>The other party clearly hadn't expected anyone to hear their call.  After calling for so many years, this was the first response, and their shock was mixed with ecstatic joy.</p><p>The voice was still too indistinct to determine if it was male or female.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't answer, stubbornly asking the same question, then adding, “Where are you?”</p><p>“I… ah!”</p><p>The other party was about to respond when a sharp, painful scream pierced the silence.</p><p>Even though the voice was muffled, Qin Sang could feel the immense pain within the scream, even greater than before.</p><p>Qin Sang was unsure what happened, perhaps the other party's excitement at receiving a response led to their exposure, attracting a powerful enemy's attack.</p><p>The scream, filled with pain, assaulted Qin Sang’s mind like a tidal wave. Anyone else might have gone mad under such a mental onslaught.</p><p>While screaming, the other party still struggled to convey something to Qin Sang.</p><p>“…wait… for… me… be… careful… otherworldly… demons…”</p><p>The voice was broken, filled with pain, like words squeezed from between clenched teeth.</p><p>The other party used all their remaining strength to utter these fragmented words, then fell silent once more.</p><p>Qin Sang waited a long time, confirming that the call had vanished again.</p><p>“Wait for me… does it mean I should wait for him, implying he’ll recover later?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered the meaning, “Beware of otherworldly demons… could the otherworldly demons refer to…”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. For the beings within this illusion, did “otherworldly demons” refer to the extraterrestrial demons that cultivators feared, or to the outsiders who had entered the illusion?</p><p>If it were extraterrestrial demons, it was hard to fathom.  This was an illusion, a fabrication; how could it attract the attention of extraterrestrial demons?</p><p>If it referred to the cultivators who had entered, it also seemed illogical.</p><p>Qin Sang had always believed the call most likely originated from a powerful Qingluan of the Star-Soul realm. The cultivators in the illusion, at most, were at the peak of the Void Refinement stage; even at their strongest, they wouldn’t be a match for it.</p><p>However…</p><p>At this point, a thought suddenly struck Qin Sang; he seemed to have been blinded by appearances!</p><p>He had witnessed Nascent Soul stage grand masters in the Sacred Land—only Hong Tian and others. But the powerful individuals among the Yi people certainly outnumbered these few; there were even Mahayana stage grand masters.</p><p>The Sacred Land had undergone a great upheaval, yet only newly ascended grand masters like Hong Tian had stepped forward. The other Yi grand masters were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Was this upheaval insignificant, unable to alarm them, or was there another reason?</p><p>Thinking deeper, was it their unwillingness, or their inability?</p><p>What if they were also battling something, trapped somewhere, unable to escape?</p><p>Recalling Hong Tian’s reluctance to enter the Heart Lake, Qin Sang felt a cold sweat break out.</p><p>An illusion capable of opposing the entire Yi people, trapping their grand masters, was too unbelievable!</p><p>If this was the truth, it explained why he had been unable to break free from the illusion.</p><p>But if even the Yi grand masters were helpless, what could they, these insignificant cultivators, accomplish?  Was it truly just to compete for the so-called 'seeds'?</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the less innocent the purpose seemed, and a growing unease settled upon him.</p><p>However, he too was trapped within the illusion, struggling to find a way out; even knowing the truth wouldn't change anything.</p><p>Perhaps the truth wasn't as such.</p><p>Qin Sang thought, looking up at the sky, waiting for the mysterious person to recover, hoping to learn more.</p><p>For now, he’d follow his plan: focus on improving his strength and searching for the Glass.</p><p>After sitting quietly for a while, Qin Sang packed away all his formation artifacts, erased his tracks, and left the valley.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Heart Lake.</p><p>The sky glowed like a sea, constantly erupting in monstrous waves.</p><p>No matter how fierce the waves, they all crashed against an invisible wall, failing to penetrate, then falling back down.</p><p>However, the radiant light continues its relentless assault, wave after wave.  If this persists, it will eventually breach the barrier and destroy everything.</p><p>Moreover, besides the giant waves, something far more terrifying lurks within the radiant light.</p><p>The sea of light undulates, with strange images flashing across its surface— fleeting glimpses of a monstrous silhouette, hinting at a fearsome beast.</p><p>Suddenly, a colossal wave crashes down, accompanied by a thunderous roar.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The entire sea of light trembles. A shadow emerges from the wave.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The shadow bursts from the wave, revealing a gigantic trunk and two silver tusks.  The outline becomes clear: a colossal elephant, larger than any mountain, its body crackling with lightning. Its every stride echoes like thunder, its ferocity palpable—an ancient thunder elephant.</p><p>The ancient thunder elephant bellows, its four feet pounding the ground before it leaps into the air, transforming into a thick bolt of lightning. Its tusks are especially prominent, radiating sharp lightning energy.</p><p>At that moment, purple light appears above the ancient thunder elephant, coalescing into a purple cloud from an unseen source.</p><p>The cloud swirls and expands, then bursts with intense purple light, descending as a circular beam, perfectly encasing the elephant.</p><p>As the purple light descends, the lightning on the elephant's body dims. The cloud continues, releasing a second, third, and more beams of light, tightening its grip around the thunder elephant.  The elephant's power wanes, but it continues its charge toward the invisible barrier.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The ancient thunder elephant is shattered against the invisible barrier, its immense impact causing the barrier to tremble violently.</p><p>Unlike the previous beasts which vanished, the remains of the thunder elephant are scattered, its flesh and blood staining the sea of light crimson.</p><p>Hong Tian groans.  He, the Queen of the Jao people, and others are positioned around the heart lake, jointly manipulating a large formation—the invisible barrier is the formation's power.</p><p>He trembles, slowly opening his eyes, first glancing outward.  One wave subsides, only to be followed by another, endlessly. Thankfully, there is no second ancient thunder elephant, granting them a brief respite.</p><p>Then, he looks into the depths of the heart lake, his voice hoarse:  “Why is there still no movement inside?”</p><p>“It seems this nightmare won't be easily subdued! We must simply do our duty, preventing the dream’s power from escaping and affecting the Mist Sea. Then we wait patiently,” the Queen of the Jao people says, part consolation, part warning.</p><p>“I fear we won’t last that long!” someone interjects, worried.  “If we fail to hold the line and the aftershocks spread, causing chaos in the Mist Sea, or even leading to the destruction of tribes, we will be unable to bear the responsibility!”</p><p>The Queen of the Jao people scoffs, “We bear the responsibility whether we can or not! The outside world is likely already affected. After all, the Mist Sea is already enveloped by the dream!”</p><p>After reaching the Saint Realm, they are privy to more of the truth.  It's unimaginable to most: the mist that covers the entire Mist Sea, spanning countless miles, shielding countless beings, is not naturally occurring, but a manifestation of dream power.</p><p>This power protects the various people, deterring outsiders from entering.  The periodic mist tides, the mirages within the mist, and the mist waterfalls that swallow countless people are all manifestations of dream disturbances; the powerful beings call them nightmares.</p><p>However, none of the previous ‘nightmares’ compare to this one.</p><p>The Great Dream God's understanding of the Dao of Dreams has not been without its challenges; nightmares are his greatest obstacle, akin to a cultivator's inner demons.</p><p>Even the Great Dream God must proceed cautiously. This disturbance is due to a nightmare raging at a critical moment. Powerful beings from the sacred land actively entered the dream to assist the Great Dream God in suppressing the nightmare.</p><p>If the nightmare consumes the Great Dream God, at best, he’ll be severely injured; at worst, he'll be utterly lost in his own dream, and the dream will become unstoppable, engulfing the entire Mist Sea!</p><p>No one knows the horrifying consequences that would follow.</p><p>The Queen of the Jao people's fears are well-founded.</p><p>Outside the sacred land, within the Mist Sea, before the usual time for the mist tide, the mist suddenly surges, filling the sea.  The mist waterfalls and mirages appear more frequently than ever before, alarming experts from various tribes.</p><p>In Qingyang City.</p><p>Su Nu and the others, returning from Yuanjiao Haishi, also noticed the unusual celestial phenomenon. Fortunately, Qingyang City had an advantage: the entire city was a massive formation.  Working together, everyone activated the formation to withstand the onslaught of the mist.</p><p>The conversation outside Xin Lake continued.</p><p>Someone echoed the Jiao Ren Empress, “Your Majesty is right, no matter what, we must hold on! Look at that thunder elephant earlier—it perfectly matches the records, in both its presence and power, almost identical to a true ancient thunder elephant. Even the remains are so realistic.  Elsewhere, who could imagine it was conjured from dream power? After today, perhaps the God-King can use dreams to create reality, and even…a dream realm!”</p><p>“A dream realm…”</p><p>Silence fell.</p><p>Everyone couldn't help but imagine: once a dream realm was created, the Yi Ren would no longer need to cower in the East Sea, beholden to other races.  Should the Demon Realm invade one day, they could hide within the dream realm and seal the boundary gate.</p><p>However, everyone knew this was mere wishful thinking. Their cultivation was far from sufficient; they couldn't imagine how a true 'dream realm' would exist, or whether it could truly separate itself from the Greater Thousand World and become its own realm.</p><p>Suddenly, someone chuckled, “We haven't even overcome this hurdle, and now we're thinking about that? It's premature. We should focus on acquiring more dream seeds. Those old-timers are clearly vying for them!”</p><p>Hong Tian’s gaze remained fixed on Xin Lake. He sighed, “We thought too simply. Those youngsters probably still don't know who they are.”</p><p>“One word: wait!”</p><p>The Jiao Ren Empress remained calm. “Wait for a turning point! Wait for them to awaken! Then things will naturally fall into place! We're outside the dream, our minds clear—that's our greatest advantage.”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang, within the dream, was conscious but helpless.</p><p>After the calls for help vanished, Qin Sang focused on the upcoming battle.</p><p>“Previously, the powerful figures from both sides rarely fought.  Now, they should finally show themselves! I need to establish an identity among the Yao race, preferably one that allows direct contact with the Feng race’s high-ranking members. Gathering intelligence from both sides might uncover clues…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, wandering through Yao territory.</p><p>Earlier, when the situation was less tense, Qin Sang had laid some groundwork.</p><p>He had killed a real Qingluan, so impersonating one was within his capabilities.</p><p>However, his last encounter taught him that a pure-blooded Qingluan was too conspicuous.  He should start by disguising himself as a member of a mixed-blood Qingluan branch.</p><p>Reviewing his prepared identities, he found one suitable. For convenient movement, he shouldn't stray too far from his base. Only one identity fit the bill.</p><p>Qin Sang checked his direction and flew for over ten days before stopping above a mountain ravine.</p><p>A rumbling sound echoed from below.  The ravine's water alone couldn't produce such a noise.</p><p>Qin Sang realized the sound originated from an underground river, a unique place akin to a celestial realm, possessing peculiar power. Cultivators accidentally swept away by the river current struggled to escape. Initially, both sides lost cultivators who fell into the river, their fate unknown.</p><p>Some were discovered much later, far away; others vanished completely.</p><p>Survivors couldn't explain their experiences, only that they were disoriented and swept away, somehow managing to escape.</p><p>Both sides avoided the river. Fortunately, though long, the river was narrow, and its power didn't affect the surface.</p><p>Qin Sang made preparations around the river and disguised himself, appearing dazed and disheveled, as if he’d just escaped.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang encountered a group of Yao cultivators.</p><p>Their leader, an unidentified妖鸟 (yao bird), shouted from afar, “Halt!”</p><p>All their auras locked onto Qin Sang.</p><p>“Friends, please calm down. I am an ally!”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, signaling his harmlessness, and asked in a bewildered tone, “Where is this? What time is it?”</p>
