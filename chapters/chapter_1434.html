<h1>Chapter 1426: The Battle of Divine Abilities</h1><p>Chapter 1426: The Battle of Divine Abilities</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The ‘d’ glyphs on the mountain pass surface pulsed repeatedly.</p><p>As the Hunmo Elder and others destroyed the protective barriers of the golden summit and pagoda, the seal was on the verge of collapse.  Not only the medicinal garden, but other areas also experienced consecutive anomalies.</p><p>Purple, flowing flames drifted through the void, flying wildly and intensifying the chaos.</p><p>Pavilions and towers collapsed or exploded, creating constant noise and billowing smoke.</p><p>Similar scenes played out repeatedly throughout the Jinghai Sect.</p><p>Amidst this almost apocalyptic landscape, the medicinal garden's changes seemed less remarkable and wouldn't directly arouse the suspicion of those Nascent Souls.</p><p>‘Rumble…Rumble…’</p><p>Endless purple mist erupted, spreading in the air and nearly filling that space, making it hard to ignore.</p><p>As the purple mist expanded, various Buddhist prohibitions flashed and collided, causing the surrounding mountains to shake violently.</p><p>Within this chaos, glimpses of the medicinal garden’s interior frequently appeared, blurred within the purple mist, yet still visible to the Nascent Souls.</p><p>Patches of scorched earth.</p><p>Dead spirit trees.</p><p>A heartbreaking sight.</p><p>Suddenly, everyone’s gaze solidified.</p><p>Amidst this desolation, a flicker of life appeared—an intact section of the medicinal garden.  Though the spirit herbs appeared withered, they stubbornly survived under the scorching heat.</p><p>“Night God Flower!”</p><p>“That's Xuan Yin Dan… the main ingredient for Xuan Shou Dan!”</p><p>…</p><p>The newly arrived Nascent Souls abruptly stopped, their cries echoing.</p><p>Xuan Shou Dan was a precious spirit pill that could extend lifespan; among similar pills ever produced, it ranked among the best.  The value of the Xuan Yin Dan was self-evident.</p><p>Other spirit herbs revealed in the medicinal garden had several worth comparable to the Xuan Yin Dan, with the rest also tempting to the Nascent Souls.</p><p>The Xuan Yin Dan and other herbs had appeared in the cultivation world before, and Qin Sang had seen them in ancient texts; he had had Tan Hao create them.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't chosen those legendary, peerless immortal herbs; while more effective, they would have been too suspicious.</p><p>These were enough to make the Nascent Souls outside ecstatic.</p><p>“The medicinal garden!”</p><p>Someone whispered, without suspicion.</p><p>The patches of scorched earth showed that most of the medicinal garden had been destroyed by the scorching heat.  Only the most precious herbs, protected by the strongest barriers, had survived to this point.</p><p>Judging by the power of the protective formation and the seal, this sect must have been incredibly powerful in its time, so it was reasonable they would possess spirit herbs of this caliber.</p><p>After seeing the medicinal garden, the virtuous person in front of the pagoda paused in his attempts to break the seal.  The Nascent Soul to his left looked profoundly regretful.</p><p>Had he known, he would have gone straight for the medicinal garden.</p><p>The treasures within the pagoda and golden summit might not compare to those spirit herbs!</p><p>Before the Golden Summit Hall,</p><p>By this time, the power of the protective barriers was almost spent.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder and the Yu Yi Yuan Jun were also affected, distracted by the medicinal garden.</p><p>The Xuan Yin Dan and other herbs held immense appeal for the Hunmo Elder.</p><p>His gaze fixed on several herbs within the purple mist.  Seeing the newly arrived Nascent Souls changing course towards the medicinal garden, a deep, murderous intent blazed in his murky eyes.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuan Jun felt the killing intent radiating from the Hunmo Elder; a chill ran down his spine.</p><p>Just then,</p><p>The Hunmo Elder seemed to discover something; his expression froze, his eyes turning into pitch-black demonic pupils. Then he abruptly turned around, his face filled with rage.</p><p>“Who!”</p><p>Hearing the Hunmo Elder’s furious roar, Yu Yi Yuan Jun finally noticed something amiss.</p><p>The Golden Summit Hall's barriers experienced unusual fluctuations, not caused by their attempts to break the seal, but from another direction!</p><p>Simultaneously, the power of the barriers rapidly dissipated.</p><p>The next moment,</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A shattering sound suddenly came from behind the mysterious statue; a crack appeared in the hidden door, followed by a black flame that crawled out from the gap, transforming into a fiery serpent that lunged towards the treasures within the temple.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity and acted decisively.</p><p>Having learned about some of the Golden Summit's barrier patterns from Tan Hao, and observing the opponents' efforts to break the seal, Qin Sang could control his actions, minimizing damage to the barrier's structure while forcibly creating an opening.</p><p>Combined with the distraction caused by the medicinal garden's anomaly,</p><p>These two factors prevented his opponents from intercepting him immediately, allowing him to gain precious time.</p><p>Securing the treasure isn't the end; escaping safely is true success. Otherwise, Qin Sang will face five Yuan Ying cultivators, including a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>"Thief!"</p><p>This thought flashed through Yu Yi Yuanjun's mind.  Noticing the perfectly timed anomaly in the medicinal garden, she instantly understood, and was filled with furious surprise.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Hun Mo Laoren's withered hand clenched tight.  His Black Bamboo staff blazed with deep black light as he thrust it forward.  Sharp as a spear, it pierced the protective barrier.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Hun Mo Order appeared in his other hand, slamming against the golden dome's barrier.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The golden dome trembled violently, as if about to collapse.</p><p>Centered on the Hun Mo Order, countless cracks spiderwebbed across the barrier, which seemed on the verge of breaking.</p><p>But at that moment, the fire serpent shot into the hall, rapidly approaching the altar, its target clearly the pure pearl that Hun Mo Laoren and Yu Yi Yuanjun coveted.</p><p>In the clash of masters, a moment is an eternity.</p><p>Even a moment's delay in breaking the barrier would allow the fire serpent to sweep away all the treasures in the hall.</p><p>Hun Mo Laoren coldly snorted, multitasking. While activating the Hun Mo Order, the black light at the tip of his Black Bamboo staff twisted like a living thing, then shot out.</p><p>Mid-flight, the black light contorted, vaguely taking the shape of a hand.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun, equally aware of the critical moment, made the right choice.</p><p>She moved swiftly, pressing close to the barrier. Her fingers elongated rapidly, transforming into crimson, demonic claws, then pierced the barrier with a harsh, grating sound.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Red Luan Killer moved inward.  The male spirits charged forward relentlessly, ignoring the barrier's resistance, forcing a crack into the barrier. The Red Luan Killer silently infiltrated, slightly slower than Hun Mo Laoren.</p><p>"Truly a Grand Cultivator..."</p><p>Hidden in the secret passage, Qin Sang observed through a crack, sighing inwardly.</p><p>His elaborate preparations fell short of expectations. Hun Mo Laoren reacted faster than anticipated, making his plan to steal all the treasures impossible.</p><p>…</p><p>In the long-silent Buddhist hall, three uninvited guests had arrived.</p><p>Or rather, three supernatural powers.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire, transformed into a fire serpent.</p><p>Black demonic light coalescing into a demonic hand.</p><p>The Red Luan Killer, still in the form of a red ribbon.</p><p>Three forces, entering the hall from different directions, shared an identical goal: the pure pearl!</p><p>Qin Sang had gained the advantage.  The pure pearl was placed to the right of the altar, near the statue.  The fire serpent first coiled around the pure pearl.</p><p>Before Hun Mo Laoren and Yu Yi Yuanjun could react, half of the Nine Nether Demon Fire broke through a protective layer, enveloped the pure pearl, and shot back!</p>
