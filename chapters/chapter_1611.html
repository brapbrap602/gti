<h1>Chapter 1602: The Withered Glory Old Devil</h1><p>“What rumors have you heard?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked in return. Jiang Mu wouldn't speak without some basis.</p><p>Jiang Mu handed Qin Sang a jade slip. “There are indeed rumors, but none can be confirmed. Truth and falsehood are intertwined, making it hard to discern!  From some clues, it seems that seemingly ordinary factions and individuals are actually not so simple…”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over the jade slip. It was all hearsay and conjecture. He chuckled, “Surely the true reclusive powers wouldn’t reveal themselves so soon? What are they plotting? They wouldn’t be trying to overthrow the Eight Sceneries View and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, would they?”</p><p>“Those two Immortal Sects are colossal entities. For now, no one should dare challenge them. But if Nascent Soul cultivators continue to be absent, it’s hard to say. There will definitely be those who harbor ambitions against them.”</p><p>Jiang Mu paused, his tone becoming conspiratorial. “Just one point, Elder Qin, aren't you curious? Even the strongest of the Demonic Sects, the Heavenly Hao Tower, has Nascent Soul cultivators only intermittently. Why are the Eight Sceneries View and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery able to maintain an unbroken line of Nascent Soul cultivators? Could it be that all the astonishingly talented geniuses in the world have been gathered by these two Immortal Sects?”</p><p>“Brother Jiang means to say that the two great Immortal Sects possess some kind of Nascent Soul cultivation method with an exceptionally high success rate…”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t surprised. In fact, after learning about the Eight Sceneries View and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, he had similar suspicions. From True Monarch Huang Xi and Saint Lesu onwards, the two sects had produced generations of talented individuals, firmly holding their positions as overlords. This was definitely no coincidence.</p><p>“I’m just speculating, it might not be true.”</p><p>Despite saying this, Jiang Mu didn’t think he was wrong. “These matters are too distant for me. I'll focus on solid cultivation, hoping to one day catch up to Elder Qin's cultivation level. However, for Grand Cultivators like you, Elder Qin, Nascent Soul isn't a pipe dream, it's something worth striving for at all costs! Inevitably, there are others who share my thoughts and are plotting in secret. Grand Cultivators outside the Daoist and Buddhist factions are powerful allies, natural allies. Once Elder Qin appears in Golden Jade Prefecture, someone will surely approach you.”</p><p>As he spoke, Jiang Mu inconspicuously glanced at Qin Sang. Solitary cultivators at the late-stage Nascent Soul realm were exceedingly rare. Qin Sang was an anomaly. Jiang Mu had always suspected that Qin Sang was a disguised expert from some powerful faction, aiming to operate discreetly. He didn’t know what the Hall Master had discussed with him back then.</p><p>“Thank you for the reminder, Brother Jiang.  I am alone, unafraid of powerful enemies, but I will not be anyone's pawn.  I hope Hall Master Mu will be able to offer me some guidance…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that one of his goals in personally attending the Ullambana Assembly in Golden Jade Prefecture was precisely this. Even without Nascent Soul cultivators, the Eight Sceneries View and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery were not to be trifled with.  Alone and with his divine abilities incomplete, his best option was to watch the tigers fight from the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn’t choose a side before understanding the situation clearly.</p><p>However, he was very interested in the factions lurking beneath the surface, especially the Formless Immortal Sect. He wondered if he would encounter any "remnants" of the Formless Immortal Sect on this trip.</p><p>As they spoke, the two arrived at the north bank dock of Flying Cloud Ferry.</p><p>Three treasure ships were waiting there, scheduled to depart the next day. Onboard were the Six Prefectures Hall’s personnel dispatched to the Golden Jade Gate, along with large goods that couldn't fit into Mustard Seed Bags. The cabins were crammed full. While the individual items might not be of particularly high grade, the sheer quantity amassed together represented a staggering value. No wonder Jiang Mu was so cautious.</p><p>Jiang Mu offered Qin Sang the best cabin. Qin Sang accepted without hesitation, entering secluded cultivation within the cabin and remaining there for several days, not even appearing when the treasure ships set sail.</p><p>The fleet sailed north along the Flying Cloud River, passing through the Dragon Residence dock and entering Zhuo Prefecture. Along the way, they learned that the Dragon Residence Grotto Heaven's contingent had already departed on a cloud ship.</p><p>As they were nearing the border of Zhuo Prefecture, about to enter Zhaoyao Prefecture, late at night, with the full moon reflecting on the river, the surface of the water shimmered.</p><p>The moving treasure ship suddenly stopped.</p><p>Sensing something amiss, Qin Sang opened the door and saw Jiang Mu standing at the stern, his face grave, staring at the center of the river.</p><p>Behind them, the water roared as a towering ship rapidly advanced on the river.</p><p>Under the moonlight, the ship resembled a black beast, imposing and unrestrained, causing all vessels, large and small, to hastily give way.</p><p>The ship bore no flags or insignia to identify its affiliation. Only at the high prow was an ancient mirror inlaid, reflecting the bright moonlight, illuminating a large swathe of the river. Anyone bathed in this moonlight felt a strange sense of confinement.</p><p>Qin Sang was no exception. While it didn't affect him, it was quite uncomfortable. He vaguely sensed several concealed auras within the ship, none of them weak.</p><p>“It’s the Heavenly Hao Tower!”</p><p>Jiang Mu muttered, immediately issuing orders to change course and avoid the approaching ship.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, no wonder.</p><p>The foremost Demonic Sect, not counting Nascent Soul cultivators, might not be weaker than the Eight Sceneries View or the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery!</p><p>His gaze shifted to the ancient mirror at the prow, and he asked in a low voice, “Is that the Heavenly Hao Tower’s sect-protecting treasure – the Heavenly Hao Ancient Mirror?”</p><p>Jiang Mu shook his head slightly. “It’s a replica. Its power is far inferior to the true Heavenly Hao Ancient Mirror. Legend says the true mirror cannot leave the Heavenly Hao Tower, though who knows if that's true! However, it's said this replica is refined using a special method, perfectly harmonizing with the ship’s formation, allowing it to unleash extraordinary power.”</p><p>As they conversed, the ship drew closer, the waves forming two massive walls of water that rushed towards them.</p><p>Just as it was about to pass them, a soft gasp came from within the ship, and the treasure ship abruptly halted, stopping beside them. The walls of water collapsed, the two vessels now only a thousand zhang apart.</p><p>Jiang Mu's expression changed.</p><p>A figure flickered into existence at the prow of the ship, standing there and looking over at them. "Which Daoist friend of the Six Prefectures Hall is this? Is it Hall Master Mu himself?"</p><p>The speaker was a young man.</p><p>He wore a brocade robe and had a somewhat gaunt face with high cheekbones. His appearance was excessively youthful, yet his hair and eyebrows were snow-white, his long eyebrows drooping.</p><p>Jiang Mu cupped his hands in greeting, his voice deep. “Jiang Mu of the Six Prefectures Hall greets Exalted Master Withered Glory. The Hall Master has been delayed and will arrive shortly.”</p><p>As he spoke, he transmitted his voice to Qin Sang, his tone grave.</p><p>“This is the Withered Glory Old Devil!”</p><p>Qin Sang stood half a step behind Jiang Mu, hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>"Exalted Master" was a respectful title for Grand Cultivators in the Heavenly Hao Tower.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Withered Glory Old Devil before.  He was not as famous as the Heavenly Hao Tower's Sect Master and Grand Elder, but he was considered the most likely candidate for the next Sect Master, a future leading figure of the Demonic Path.</p><p>The Withered Glory Old Devil had gained some renown even before reaching Nascent Soul. He cultivated a bizarre demonic art of the Heavenly Hao Tower, which caused him to appear prematurely aged, like a centenarian.</p><p>Not only his appearance but also his internal vital energy weakened, and even his lifespan decreased.</p><p>Those who cultivated this demonic art, aging overnight, had to contend with these adverse effects, racing against time to break through. Only those with exceptional talent dared to attempt it.</p><p>As cultivation progressed, this state would gradually improve, the cultivator’s appearance becoming increasingly youthful.</p><p>Upon achieving Grand Cultivator status, a vast new world opened up!</p><p>Since the founding of the Heavenly Hao Tower, only a handful had mastered this demonic art, and the Withered Glory Old Devil was not only accomplished in his cultivation but also the youngest among them.</p><p>“Not being here is not being here. What’s the point of saying he’ll arrive shortly? Are you afraid I’ll annihilate your fleet?”</p><p>The Withered Glory Old Devil chuckled strangely, his long eyebrows twitching. His gaze shifted, noticing Qin Sang behind Jiang Mu. He sized Qin Sang up, a look of surprise appearing on his face. “This Daoist friend looks unfamiliar.”</p><p>Jiang Mu gave an awkward laugh and introduced Qin Sang. “This is our Hall’s guest elder, Elder Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded with a smile. “I’ve long admired Daoist Friend Withered Glory’s great name. Seeing you today, you truly live up to your reputation!”</p><p>The Withered Glory Old Devil stared intently at Qin Sang, his surprise deepening.</p><p>Inside the ship, other experts of the Heavenly Hao Tower noticed the Withered Glory Old Devil’s unusual behavior.</p><p>Several strands of divine sense probed cautiously, only to be repelled unceremoniously by Qin Sang.</p><p>Muffled groans immediately echoed from within the ship.</p><p>“Don’t be impudent!”</p><p>The Withered Glory Old Devil snapped at the interior of the ship. He showed none of the casualness he had displayed towards Jiang Mu, instead speaking formally, “My subordinates are uncouth. I apologize for their behavior, Daoist Friend Qin.”</p><p>“It's nothing,” Qin Sang replied, his smile unwavering.</p><p>“With Daoist Friend Qin joining, the Six Prefectures Hall is even more formidable, truly solidifying its position as the number one merchant association!  Forgive my ignorance, but may I ask from which Immortal Sect Daoist Friend Qin hails?”</p><p>The Withered Glory Old Devil racked his brain, but he couldn't place Qin Sang's origins.</p><p>Qin Sang replied nonchalantly, "I am a solitary cultivator, with no fixed abode. It's normal that you haven't heard of me. Is Daoist Friend Withered Glory the only one attending this Ullambana Assembly?  Are Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan aboard?  I’ve long admired them as well.”</p><p>Elder Fan was the current Grand Elder of the Heavenly Hao Tower, equal in status to Sect Master Yu. The Withered Glory Old Devil’s standing was still slightly below theirs.</p><p>“The Sect Master is at a crucial juncture in cultivating a secret technique and is unable to leave seclusion.  The Grand Elder has other important matters to attend to and may not have time to visit Golden Jade Prefecture.”</p><p>The Withered Glory Old Devil’s answer was unexpected.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jiang Mu exchanged glances.</p><p>In their previous discussions, they both assumed that with the absence of Nascent Soul deterrence, the Heavenly Hao Tower would not remain idle. Even if they didn't appear personally, they would certainly be stirring things up behind the scenes.</p><p>Unexpectedly, only the Withered Glory Old Devil had come.</p><p>Or perhaps, they were already hidden in the shadows, beginning their machinations?</p><p>Qin Sang found it strange.</p><p>For this Ullambana Assembly, Mount Nien Shan was closed off, and the Heavenly Hao Tower’s two leading figures were unaccounted for. He wondered if the other Immortal Sects would cause any trouble.</p><p>The Golden Jade Gate wished to hold a grand Dharma Assembly unprecedented in history, but their wish was unlikely to be fulfilled.</p><p>The Withered Glory Old Devil invited Qin Sang aboard his ship for a discussion, but Qin Sang declined.</p><p>With the situation unclear, he didn’t want to become too close to any particular sect, especially the Heavenly Hao Tower.</p><p>After exchanging a few words across the distance, the Withered Glory Old Devil noticed Qin Sang's indifference and didn't press the matter further.</p><p>After this small interlude, the fleet entered the central region of Zhaoyao Prefecture, turning eastward along the largest tributary of the Flying Cloud River, and sailed into Golden Jade Prefecture.</p><p>The tributary’s estuary was located in Golden Jade Prefecture and was also the site of Rainbow City, the prefecture’s most prosperous market town, controlled by the Golden Jade Gate.</p><p>The Ullambana Assembly was to be held in Rainbow City.</p><p>Openly plundering large merchant associations, especially those with Nascent Soul cultivators guarding them, was actually quite rare.</p><p>They entered Golden Jade Prefecture without incident.</p><p>Even before reaching Rainbow City, they could clearly feel the influence of the Ullambana Assembly. Countless treasure ships crowded the river, and all manner of escape lights could be seen streaking across the sky, some traveling alone, others in groups.</p><p>Regardless of cultivation level, no one wanted to miss this once-in-five-hundred-years event.  Five hundred years could encompass the entire life of a Golden Core cultivator!</p><p>The Golden Jade Gate, well aware of the unrest within the cultivation world, dispatched disciples to patrol and guard the riverbanks, deterring petty criminals.  This part of the journey was much safer than Zhaoyao Prefecture.</p><p>…</p><p>“Elder Qin, Rainbow City has arrived.”</p><p>Someone activated the restriction outside the cabin.</p><p>Qin Sang awakened, withdrawing his divine abilities and stepping out of the cabin.  He saw Jiang Mu directing the treasure ship towards the dock and ascended to the top deck alone. “What a magnificent Rainbow City!”</p><p>Flying Cloud Ferry was suspended in the sky.</p><p>Rainbow City was built upon mountains.</p><p>The estuary's flanks were not plains, but undulating hills and towering peaks.</p><p>These peaks were all utilized, analogous to the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches districts of Flying Cloud Ferry, divided into different levels and functions based on their location and size.</p><p>Countless rainbow bridges, long and short, connected the peaks, crisscrossing yet without any sense of disorder, forming a unique and beautiful vista.</p><p>From afar, the entire Rainbow City resembled a gigantic rainbow bridge.</p><p>A gateway between mountains and sea!</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t need to bother with the following mundane affairs. Disciples from the local branch came to receive him, leading him to the Six Prefectures Hall’s residence. Coincidentally, it was Gong Xingqing, whom Qin Sang had previously intimidated.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang again, now transformed into a guest elder of the merchant association, Gong Xingqing couldn’t forget the feeling of being suppressed by a Grand Cultivator’s aura. He was timid and apprehensive before Qin Sang, nervously explaining the arrangements made by the Golden Jade Gate.</p><p>The north and south banks of the estuary served different functions.</p><p>The south bank was for mortals, rogue cultivators, and smaller sects and factions.</p><p>The north bank was the heart of Rainbow City.</p><p>The layout of the main peak on the north bank was remarkably regular.  Qin Sang suspected that someone had used a mountain-moving divine ability to arrange them.</p><p>With the main peak as the center, the other peaks were arranged in a八卦 (Bagua - Eight Trigrams) pattern, becoming progressively shorter the further out they were.</p><p>The two grand auction gatherings, as well as the Ullambana Assembly, were all to be held on the main peak.  The Golden Jade Gate had completed preparations decades ago.</p><p>The Six Prefectures Hall maintained a low profile, their residence located on a mountain to the southwest of the main peak, in a middling position, neither too high nor too low.</p><p>Naturally, the Six Prefectures Hall's treasure exchange and auction would still be held near the main peak.</p><p>Flying across a rainbow bridge, Qin Sang observed the local customs of Golden Jade Prefecture with interest.  He inquired about the Six Prefectures Hall’s personnel and learned that Hall Master Mu and Vice Hall Master Lei hadn’t arrived yet.  Only Vice Hall Master Jiang You was in Rainbow City.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang and Gong Xingqing reached the residence.</p><p>After exchanging greetings with Vice Hall Master Jiang You, Jiang You mentioned Hall Master Mu’s whereabouts. “The Hall Master is currently in the East Sea, dealing with a thorny matter.”</p><p>“Oh? What important matter? Perhaps I can lend a hand?”</p><p>“It’s not a major issue, but it requires some time. The Hall Master’s personal attention is sufficient. Otherwise, we would certainly have asked Elder Qin to come out of seclusion,” Jiang You said with a chuckle.</p><p>Since Qin Sang was only a guest elder, he didn't pry further and instead asked about the situation in Rainbow City.</p><p>“A month ago, Master Xingji led several Zen Masters to Rainbow City and took up residence at the Golden Jade Gate. Yesterday, the Eight Sceneries View’s experts also arrived. There are quite a few of them, but only True Person Zi Lei, a Grand Cultivator, is leading them. They found a secluded courtyard on the main peak and rarely venture out. More than ninety percent of the renowned sects and factions from the Central Plains have arrived.  Except for Mount Nien Shan being closed off, Yue Lingtian of Mount Taiyue and the Poison King of Mount Wandu are also still nowhere to be seen.”</p><p>Jiang You had been stationed in Rainbow City and was well-informed about the movements of various factions.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this information.</p><p>The Ullambana Assembly was led by the Buddhist sects, but the Dharma Assembly was hosted alternately by Daoist and Buddhist sects. The Eight Sceneries View, for the sake of their own Zhongyuan Dharma Assembly, had to show some respect and usually sent at least two Grand Cultivators.</p><p>However, since True Person Zi Lei was the View Master, his personal attendance was sufficient, and no one could find fault with it.</p><p>Mount Taiyue and Mount Wandu were located far away in the Southern Barbarian Two Prefectures, so their later arrival was understandable.</p><p>In addition, there were also representatives from the Northern Wastelands, Western Deserts, and East Sea who had come to observe the ceremony.</p><p>All parties converged in Rainbow City, a gathering of countless experts!</p>
