<h1>Chapter 1235: A Plot</h1><p>On a stone platform.</p><p>Dongyang Bo activated the King Kong Zhuo, concealing his figure.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for a while. Seeing Dongyang Bo standing motionless, she grew more curious.  It seemed he had been there for quite some time.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's position in the righteous path of Xiaohan Domain was akin to that of an alliance leader.  His disruption of Ye Laomo's plan was of significant importance to the overall situation.  His failure to quickly join up with others, strategize, and instead coming here alone was very strange.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang suspected hidden treasures nearby, with Dongyang Bo having discovered clues in ancient texts and planning to seize the treasure before joining the others. But the more she watched, the more something felt wrong.</p><p>After a long time, Dongyang Bo still did nothing, just standing there idly. If he were waiting for a treasure to appear, he wouldn't need to go to such lengths to hide using his life-saving treasure, unless the treasure was guarded by a spirit beast.</p><p>Even the Sky-Eyed Butterfly almost missed him, showing how cautious Dongyang Bo was.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to monitor Dongyang Bo's movements, while she herself maintained a distance, stealthily moving to observe the surroundings, trying to fathom his purpose.</p><p>Unexpectedly encountering an enemy, and with the enemy in the open and herself hidden, Qin Sang wouldn't miss such an opportunity.  She immediately put away Fat Chicken and decided to wait and see what Dongyang Bo was up to.</p><p>Revenge would be preferable.  Even if a suitable opportunity for revenge didn't present itself immediately,  the chance to disrupt Dongyang Bo's plan and steal whatever treasure he was after would still be satisfying, and Qin Sang was more than willing to do so.</p><p>After looking around, Qin Sang didn't see anyone else.  Only Dongyang Bo was present.</p><p>Besides the ancient restrictions on the two mountain peaks beside Qin Sang, there were no other unusual occurrences nearby, nor any signs of a treasure about to appear.</p><p>This made Dongyang Bo's actions even more puzzling.</p><p>"What is he waiting for?"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand, and decided to continue waiting with Dongyang Bo.</p><p>‘Rumble…...’</p><p>Waves of blood-red lightning struck down from the heavens, continuously hitting the mountain peaks.</p><p>The surrounding area rumbled, but it couldn't mask the silence and desolation of the place.</p><p>In such a location, at this time, there were two strange individuals, both hidden in the shadows, remaining motionless for a long time, not knowing what they awaited.</p><p>Qin Sang was patient, but she began to wonder if she had made a mistake.  Perhaps the white light wasn't the King Kong Zhuo, but a similar treasure.</p><p>But she couldn't let the Sky-Eyed Butterfly examine it closely.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's cultivation was a level above hers, and since he wasn't distracted by anything else, being observed might trigger his suspicions and reveal her presence.</p><p>Just then, someone suddenly flew in from a distance.</p><p>Qin Sang had been watching Dongyang Bo.  She only noticed a slight fluctuation in the white light when the uninvited guest appeared. Turning her head, she saw a streak of light flying towards them.</p><p>"Dongyang Bo is waiting for this person."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was stirred.  It wasn't treasure hunting, as she'd initially thought; Dongyang Bo was waiting for someone.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>A barely audible sigh came from within the white light, "You've finally arrived. I thought I was mistaken about you."</p><p>Then, the white light dimmed. Dongyang Bo suppressed the King Kong Zhuo's aura, flashed down from the rock, and hid in a more concealed location.</p><p>"Could it be Dongyang Bo's enemy?"</p><p>Seeing Dongyang Bo's movements, Qin Sang quickly reviewed the Yuan Ying cultivators who had entered Blood Lake.</p><p>Those who entered Blood Lake were mostly Yuan Ying cultivators from Xiaohan Domain.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was adept at maneuvering; he only had rivals driven by conflicting interests, such as Chongyi Daozhang, but their conflict wasn't to the death. Qin Sang couldn't even find an ally.</p><p>As the person approached, Qin Sang discovered that he wasn't a Yuan Ying cultivator, but Gongliang Yu, the Palace Master of the Shangyuan Quiet Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen him on Shiqu Mountain and recognized him immediately.</p><p>"Why is it him?"</p><p>Qin Sang was dumbfounded.</p><p>The Shangyuan Quiet Palace had deep roots and was ranked among the top sects, yet it hadn't produced a Yuan Ying cultivator in recent centuries, making its high rank somewhat undeserved.</p><p>To compensate, the Shangyuan Quiet Palace chose a powerful ally to avoid losses when competing for resources with other sects.  Because of their good relationship with Xiaohua Mountain, they moved in tandem.</p><p>The previous Palace Master, Tieguanzi, and the current Palace Master, Gongliang Yu, both followed this strategy.  When Qin Sang was at Xiaohua Mountain, she had addressed the Shangyuan Quiet Palace elders as "Master Uncle" and "Master Uncle."</p><p>Logically, Gongliang Yu and Dongyang Bo should be very close.</p><p>The Shangyuan Quiet Palace and Xiaohua Mountain were closely related, and there were no known conflicts between them. Dongyang Bo's actions, however, seemed like an attempt to ambush Gongliang Yu, leaving Qin Sang bewildered and unable to guess his intentions.</p><p>Gongliang Yu was completely unaware that he was under the observation of two Yuan Ying cultivators.  Holding a wooden carving in one hand and a jade pendant in the other, he flew closer, and upon seeing the two almost identical twin peaks, a look of joy appeared on his face.</p><p>"Finally found it!"</p><p>He landed between the two mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly retreated, putting some distance between herself and Gong Liangyu, watching to see what Dongyang Bo would do.</p><p>With Dongyang Bo's cultivation, killing Gong Liangyu wouldn't require any underhanded tactics.</p><p>Of course, Gong Liangyu, the Palace Master of Shangyuan Quiet Palace, possessed the entire sect's heritage and was a peak Golden Core cultivator himself, surely having life-saving measures.</p><p>However, in a place like Blood Lake, he might be restricted.</p><p>Perhaps that's why Dongyang Bo chose this location to strike.</p><p>Seeing the joy on Gong Liangyu's face, Qin Sang couldn't help but silently lament for him.</p><p>Landing on the ground, Gong Liangyu remained vigilant, but he couldn't possibly imagine two Yuan Ying cultivators plotting against him.</p><p>"Twin Peaks, this is the place!"</p><p>Gong Liangyu looked up, examining the twin peaks around him, matching the description in the message perfectly.</p><p>"Ten more li north, and I'll reach the place. Once I obtain the Blood Ginseng and achieve Nascent Soul, I'll no longer need to curry favor with anyone!"</p><p>Gong Liangyu seemed to recall some unpleasant past, a sneer playing on his lips as he impatiently took flight, speeding north.</p><p>Qin Sang remained where she was, observing the faint white light concealing Dongyang Bo, who followed Gong Liangyu silently.</p><p>After waiting a while, Qin Sang finally moved.</p><p>It was a classic case of the mantis stalking the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't fathom Dongyang Bo's intentions, making it hard to decide what to do.</p><p>Dongyang Bo killing Gong Liangyu likely stemmed from a desire to annex Shangyuan Quiet Palace.</p><p>Absorbing Shangyuan Quiet Palace would not only significantly increase Xiaohua Mountain's strength, but Dongyang Bo would also gain access to Shangyuan Quiet Palace's cultivation techniques and secrets, making him even more formidable.</p><p>Logically and emotionally, Qin Sang couldn't stand by and watch Dongyang Bo kill Gong Liangyu. Saving him would not only cripple Dongyang Bo, but also create a sworn enemy for him.</p><p>These thoughts raced through her mind as Qin Sang followed discreetly from afar.</p><p>Soon, Gong Liangyu, in the lead, stopped.</p><p>Before Gong Liangyu stood an unremarkable hill, but at its base was a cave, glowing blood red inside, emitting a constant stream of blood mist—a rather eerie sight.</p>
