<h1>Chapter 992: Moon Gazing Rhinoceros</h1><p>Chapter 992: Moon Gazing Rhinoceros</p><p>Qin Sang quickly explained the situation.</p><p>Yuan Zhu listened to the story, his mouth slightly agape, then suddenly chuckled, leaving Qin Sang completely baffled.</p><p>“Yuan was framed by a demonic king in my clan.  I didn't expect, friend, that you'd be pursued by a Yuan Ying cultivator right after leaving. We truly share a common plight…”</p><p>“A great enemy is approaching, friend. Don't jest,”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed helplessly.</p><p>Yuan Zhu turned serious, pondered for a moment, then asked, “Is it necessary to enter the deepest part of the storm belt to escape pursuit?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He was currently within the storm belt, yet Mou Lao Mo was still hot on his heels, proving that the outer reaches of the storm belt had limited effect on the fire curse.</p><p>Yuan Zhu's eyes flickered as he looked at Qin Sang.  “Why do you believe I possess a treasure that can help you overcome this crisis?”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang’s heart stirred.</p><p>If Yuan Zhu were helpless, he wouldn't be acting this way.</p><p>With a great enemy approaching, there wasn't time to haggle with Yuan Zhu.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade slip he had prepared, throwing it to Yuan Zhu, and said gravely, “Yuan Dao You, regardless of how precious it is, this cultivation technique should satisfy you!”</p><p>The jade slip contained the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* (Heavenly Demon Refining Form), although Qin Sang only included the first level for now.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's confidence, Yuan Zhu's illusory form paused slightly, received the jade slip, and vanished into a pillar of light.</p><p>After a moment, a soft gasp came from the light pillar, followed by Yuan Zhu’s true form flying out and landing before Qin Sang, his expression urgent, and he questioned repeatedly.</p><p>“Where did you obtain this technique? Is there only one level?”</p><p>“The technique does have more than one level…”</p><p>Qin Sang paused, then countered, “Shouldn't you answer my question first?”</p><p>Yuan Zhu sighed, “Even the most advanced techniques in our Jiao clan's heritage are inferior to this *Tian Yao Lian Xing*.  If I had encountered this technique in the past, I would have given anything to obtain it.”</p><p>“Though affected by a secret technique, your bloodline remains that of a Jiao dragon,”</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely, “You've been curious why I possess phoenix wings and such pure demonic energy, haven’t you?  To be frank, I’ve cultivated the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* to the third level. This technique must have been created by a top-tier ancient cultivator; it's incredibly comprehensive.  Even I, a human, can cultivate it. You might find a way to break the deadlock through this. Even if you only borrow a portion of its essence, you will greatly benefit, and your future will be bright.”</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang didn't mention that his ability to cultivate the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* was thanks to the Jade Buddha.</p><p>Yuan Zhu nodded, not denying it.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Yuan Zhu changed the subject, “Have you heard of the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros?”</p><p>“Moon Gazing Rhinoceros?”</p><p>Qin Sang carefully recalled, “I saw it mentioned in an ancient text once. It seems to have been a remarkable spirit beast in ancient times, but I don't know its abilities.”</p><p>Yuan Zhu explained, “The Moon Gazing Rhinoceros bloodline is extinct, and there are no descendants in the Demon Sea. However, our Jiao clan's texts contain a record stating that when Moon Gazing Rhinoceroses cultivated, they absorbed moonlight. Even at noon, under the intense sunlight, it didn't affect their cultivation. Regardless of location, they could sense the moon's energy, more effectively than our star-based navigation…”</p><p>Pausing slightly, Yuan Zhu revealed a secret.</p><p>“The truth is, our demon race has been searching for a way to counterattack the Canglang Sea, not only seeking ancient teleportation arrays, but also having demon kings venture deep into the storm belt, attempting to traverse it and find a passage to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>“The demon race once obtained a fragment of a Moon Gazing Rhinoceros horn.  The horn possessed a similar ability to the beast itself.</p><p>“Some seniors used fragments of the horn to refine some treasures. Powerful demon kings who carried the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros horn fragment into the storm belt had a significantly reduced risk of getting lost.</p><p>“Unfortunately, all attempts failed. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been manipulated and ended up in this situation.</p><p>“I possess a treasure made from a Moon Gazing Rhinoceros horn.”</p><p>Yuan Zhu stopped being coy, a flash of light in his hand producing an object.</p><p>The treasure was small, only about the size of a thumb.</p><p>The treasure was smooth as a mirror, radiating a moonlit glow. It was a pointed cone shape, with a slightly curved tip, resembling a real rhinoceros horn.</p><p>Upon hearing the treasure's origin, Qin Sang looked deeply at Yuan Zhu, “If you can obtain such a treasure, your status within the Jiao clan must be no lower than Gu Heng's, right?”</p><p>It seemed Yuan Zhu's ability to perceive the demon clan's conspiracy had a reason.</p><p>“The past is like smoke and clouds, meaningless. The moment they treated me as a pawn, I severed ties with the Demon Sea's demon clan.”</p><p>Yuan Zhu said indifferently, “This treasure only has this one ability, it's no longer useful to me. Giving it to you is fine.  After all, even without the risk of getting lost, the storm belt still holds countless dangers. I wouldn't dare go in alone.”</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up. He immediately tossed another jade slip to Yuan Zhu.  "I only obtained the first four levels of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique.  That should be enough to cultivate to the late Transformation stage. I hope it meets your expectations."</p><p>Yuan Zhu took the jade slip and eagerly pressed it to his forehead. After a quick perusal of its contents, a look of surprise spread across his face.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang mention that the technique was incomplete,</p><p>Yuan Zhu nodded without surprise, a hint of melancholy in his expression. His tone was vaguely tinged with sadness. "This is a lost world.  The greatest treasures are shattered, the most profound techniques scattered…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. "What do you mean by that, friend?"</p><p>"Those aren't my words. They are the words of a Nascent Soul stage elder from our Demon Sea..."</p><p>Yuan Zhu clutched the jade slip.  "*Heavenly Demon Transformation* was undoubtedly one of the most extraordinary cultivation methods among the ancient demons. Friend, your obtaining the first four levels is a stroke of incredible luck, far exceeding my expectations."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.  Among the top-tier techniques and secrets he possessed—the *Soul-Nourishing Sword Chapter*, *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, *Yin-Yang Celestial Duel Secret Technique*, and *Thunder Control Technique*—all were incomplete. A premonition had been growing within him.</p><p>The Demon elder's words confirmed his suspicions. Not only was the cultivation world fragmented, but the greatest legacies and treasures were also incomplete.</p><p>The underlying mystery sent shivers down his spine.</p><p>Yuan Zhu hadn't expected his offhand remark to cause such a stir in Qin Sang.</p><p>Holding the jade slip, Yuan Zhu said, "I'm willing to exchange my Moonlit Rhinoceros Horn for this technique. However, I would ask you to grant me one condition. I have a matter that requires your assistance."</p><p>"What would you have me do?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu hesitated. "I can't spare myself right now, and I need to confirm something first. Whether or not I need your help is still uncertain. So… if you manage to survive this ordeal, come find Yuan Zhu here ten years from now. We can discuss it further then. Rest assured, your assistance won't go unrewarded."</p><p>The situation was urgent, so Qin Sang could only agree.</p>
