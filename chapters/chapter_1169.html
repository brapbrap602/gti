<h1>Chapter 1161: Soul-Tempering Pill</h1><p>As Qin Sang approached the Blazing Demon Sect, he felt a wave of scorching heat. The place had been carefully chosen by the Robed Daoist. While the intense geothermal energy made it unsuitable for other sects, it was perfect for the disciples of the Blazing Demon Sect to cultivate the "Seven Suns Art."</p><p>Qin Sang appeared at the foot of the mountain, gazing up at the sect's protective formation. The scene on the volcanic mountain was much the same as when he had last visited. The slopes were covered with red-leafed spirit trees, and among them stood various lodges and pavilions. The protective formation condensed red mist that flowed slowly through the air, shimmering brilliantly under the blazing sun.</p><p>After a moment of observation, Qin Sang confirmed that the formation had not been altered. This formation was a legacy left by the Ancestor of the Dark Yin, meticulously arranged by the Robed Daoist. The geothermal energy amplified the formation, and over time, its power had only grown stronger. It was incredibly complex, with countless variations, and the disciples of the Blazing Demon Sect lacked the ability to modify it.</p><p>Carrying the command talisman and familiar with all the formation's intricacies, Qin Sang, with his current cultivation, could easily infiltrate the sect without alerting anyone. He arrived before a grove of red-leafed trees, and with a flicker of his figure, he disappeared into the woods. The red mist above rippled slightly before settling back into calm.</p><p>Several low-level disciples were cultivating within the forest. A patrol of disciples passed by shortly after, but none noticed anything amiss. Qin Sang moved silently through the trees, his senses sharp enough to catch every word and action of the disciples.</p><p>In a medicinal garden, two disciples were using magical tools to summon clouds and rain, watering the spirit herbs.</p><p>"Senior Brother, I heard that Uncle Zhao just returned from the Yin Spring Sect, and he didn't look too happy. Did you see him when you went to the main hall earlier? Did you hear anything?" asked a young girl, her voice soft and delicate.</p><p>The young man beside her glanced at her. "You girls are always gossiping. What are you speculating about this time?"</p><p>"Is it really just speculation?" the girl pouted, her tone defiant. "All the sects affiliated with the Azure Sun Sect have to take turns guarding the front lines. Everyone knows it's our turn next. Among the nearby sects, the Yin Spring Sect is the strongest, and they relay the orders from the Azure Sun Demon Sect. We have no choice but to obey. Uncle Zhao must have gone to the Yin Spring Sect to discuss this. If he looks upset, it means the mission might be dangerous. Aren't we allowed to care about our sect?"</p><p>The young man chuckled and shook his head. "You're as sharp-tongued as ever! But with our level of cultivation, what can we do even if we know the reason? It's better to focus on cultivating these spirit herbs and do our part for the sect."</p><p>Though he spoke lightly, a deep worry flickered in his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled leisurely through the spirit fields. Along the way, he overheard several similar conversations. Most of the disciples were deeply concerned about their sect, and their auras were not tainted with excessive malice.</p><p>He hadn't expected the Azure Sun Demon Sect's influence to extend so far, even integrating the demonic forces near the Blazing Demon Sect. The Azure Sun Demon Sect was somewhat of an anomaly among demonic sects. Due to their cultivation methods and location, they were shunned by the righteous sects and forced to align with the demonic path. However, their actions were relatively upright.</p><p>Of course, this didn't mean the Azure Sun Demon Sect was benevolent. The world of cultivation was inherently one of survival of the fittest. Even among righteous sects, there was scheming and infighting, but at least there were some boundaries.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of letting the Green Goat Temple fall into the demonic path. If the Blazing Demon Sect were filled with cruel and bloodthirsty individuals, he wouldn't consider merging it with the Green Goat Temple, as it would corrupt the foundation.</p><p>From what he could see, Mei Gu had managed the sect well. This was also influenced by the surrounding environment. With the Azure Sun Demon Sect keeping things in check, this region hadn't descended into the lawless, cannibalistic chaos typical of other demonic territories.</p><p>From the disciples' conversations, Qin Sang learned that Mei Gu was currently in the mountain. He quickened his pace, heading toward the summit.</p><p>In the main hall of the sect, a woman in palace attire was discussing something with an elderly man. Both of them wore expressions of anger.</p><p>The woman was Mei Gu. She had already formed her Golden Core, and her appearance hadn't changed much since Qin Sang last saw her. She still looked like a delicate, fragile woman. Yet, it was this seemingly frail figure who had shouldered the burden of leading the sect through the trials of war, ensuring its survival in the cracks between greater powers.</p><p>Not only had the Blazing Demon Sect not declined, but it had also begun to thrive. Even more impressively, Mei Gu's own cultivation hadn't stagnated.</p><p>The elderly man was Zhao Shanran, one of the four Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Blazing Demon Sect's past. His cultivation was a step below Mei Gu's, at the False Core stage. The once-ambitious young man had now reached his twilight years, his vitality waning.</p><p>"Did Junior Brother Lu really appear at the Yin Spring Sect?" Mei Gu's brows were tightly knit, as if she were grappling with a difficult problem.</p><p>"Senior Sister, you once helped Elder Qi. He wouldn't lie to us about something like this. Elder Qi stumbled upon Lu's traces by accident. At the time, there were many people at the Yin Spring Sect, and it's likely that Lu colluded with their sect leader," Zhao Shanran said, his voice tinged with fear. "If Elder Qi hadn't warned me in time, and if I hadn't taken a different route, I might have been ambushed and killed by that scoundrel! Heaven has no eyes—how could someone as despicable as Lu form a Golden Core?"</p><p>Mei Gu sighed. "Back then, we obtained four Soul-Tempering Pills, and each of us received one. Junior Brother Lu's talent was the best among the four of us. It's not surprising that he succeeded in forming his core."</p><p>"But he didn't have just one Soul-Tempering Pill—he had two!" Zhao Shanran, who had been closest to Redleaf Hermit, gnashed his teeth at the thought, furious that he couldn't personally avenge his friend.</p><p>Mei Gu shook her head. "The battlefield was always fraught with danger. There was no concrete evidence at the time to prove that Redleaf Junior Brother was murdered..."</p><p>"Redleaf Junior Brother was definitely killed by that scoundrel Lu! Senior Sister, you're too kind-hearted. Back then, you should have listened to me and killed him immediately! I suspect that Lu's escape might have been aided by the Yin Spring Sect. This time, the Yin Spring Sect might be fabricating orders to lure us into a trap, using Lu's name to swallow up our sect."</p><p>Zhao Shanran's voice was filled with indignation.</p><p>"Junior Brother, don't be hasty. Whether Lu is alive or dead is secondary. What's most urgent now is how to deal with the Yin Spring Sect," Mei Gu said calmly, trying to soothe Zhao Shanran. She glanced toward the door. "It's a reasonable demand for the Yin Spring Sect to ask for a Golden Core cultivator. I'll go myself. But their other demands are excessive. They've already taken a batch of our disciples. If they take more, our sect will be left empty."</p><p>After a pause, Mei Gu's voice grew serious. "Their main goal is undoubtedly to draw me away. We can negotiate the other terms. Once I'm at the front lines, I'll make my own arrangements. Don't worry about my safety—the Yin Spring Sect can't do as they please. However, Junior Brother, you must remain vigilant while guarding the sect. Remember what we used to do?"</p><p>Mei Gu's eyes burned with intensity.</p><p>"One word—endure!" Zhao Shanran exhaled slowly. "It's a pity I'm too dull-witted and failed to form my core. I can't share your burden, Senior Sister. But rest assured, once you leave, I'll seal the mountain immediately. Thankfully, you never gave the formation talisman and diagrams to that scoundrel Lu. Let's see how much power he really has to break through the formation personally arranged by the Sect Master!"</p>
