<h1>Chapter 1559: The Spirit-幻 Toad</h1><p>“Daoist Lu, could the Stone Toad have fled its lair due to external threats?”</p><p>After searching for a long time, they still found nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but voice his concerns.</p><p>The threat he referred to was the swarm of Corpse Flame Moths.</p><p>After killing the moths, they continued their search, discovering that many tunnels were completely deserted, devoid of any living creature.  Unsurprisingly, they seemed to have been slaughtered by the moths.</p><p>The Corpse Flame Moths had no natural predators in this area, and their rampant killing spree posed a deadly threat to the local creatures.  Any insect or beast with keen senses would have already migrated.</p><p>During their search, they carefully suppressed their Yuan Ying aura.</p><p>Lu Zhang frowned. “The Corpse Flame Moths shouldn't be able to see through the Stone Toad's disguise.  As long as they don't cause widespread destruction to the environment, the Stone Toad shouldn't be driven away. Although there's no clear record, I suspect that before the Stone Toad matures, its lair plays an irreplaceable role for it.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Stone Toad?”</p><p>A man in gray robes in the distance rubbed his chin, pondering for a moment before admitting he couldn’t recall the Stone Toad’s origins.  Seeing that the two wouldn’t be leaving anytime soon, the gray-robed man retreated underground to report to the man with the grotesque face.  “….One is an elder from the Mount Bu Nian, the other is unfamiliar, but their cultivation is not bad, both at the mid-Yuan Ying stage. They are searching for the Stone Toad, some kind of treasure, it seems.”</p><p>The grotesque-faced man remained silent.</p><p>The gray-robed man waited a while, then tentatively said, “Master, these two traveled a long way, this treasure must be extremely valuable…”</p><p>He didn't care about offending Mount Bu Nian. At most, the Mount Bu Nian sect leader was on par with his master; taking it would be taking it, what could Mount Bu Nian do?</p><p>The grotesque-faced man neither confirmed nor denied, lost in thought for a long time before slowly saying, “If it’s that kind of spirit creature, it would be a good candidate for a Gu beast, with far greater potential than your Five-Colored Poisonous Spider…”</p><p>The gray-robed man was overjoyed.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man stood up, grabbed the jade armored insect in front of him, and with a flick of his sleeve, imprisoned the remaining Corpse Flame Moths. Then he sealed the formation, concealing the traces of their presence, and walked out.</p><p>The gray-robed man quickly followed.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man proceeded calmly, first visiting the place where Qin Sang and the other had killed the Corpse Flame Moths, surveying the area, before instructing his disciple to continue tracking the targets.</p><p>“They’re still searching!” the gray-robed man exclaimed joyfully.</p><p>However, the grotesque-faced man showed no immediate intention to act, leisurely following his disciple while diligently refining the jade armored insect, only instructing the gray-robed man to keep a close watch with the Five-Colored Poisonous Spider.</p><p>Seeing this, the gray-robed man understood his master's intention: seize the Stone Toad when the opportunity arises; there was no need to kill, as a life-or-death struggle offered no advantages.</p><p>One of the targets came from a prestigious sect, and the other was undoubtedly strong; neither was an easy opponent.</p><p>Thinking of the soon-to-be-acquired Gu beast with immense potential,</p><p>the gray-robed man eagerly prepared himself, focusing on controlling the Five-Colored Poisonous Spider.</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Qin Sang and Lu Zhang had searched over 70% of the area, nearly two months having passed since they entered the basin.  Working in shifts, neither felt particularly fatigued.</p><p>They hadn't encountered any large groups of Corpse Flame Moths afterward, eliminating any immediate threat.</p><p>However, after such a long and fruitless search, a lack of success was naturally disheartening.</p><p>Lu Zhang was no longer entirely confident.</p><p>In the underground tunnels.</p><p>The two activated the treasure bell, traversing the spiderweb-like passages, listening to the monotonous ringing as they moved forward silently.</p><p>Another shift change.</p><p>The treasure bell was passed to Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Ring… ring… ring…’</p><p>Qin Sang tried to lighten the mood, jokingly comparing himself to a street vendor, ringing his bell as he darted through the streets.  He shared this thought with Lu Zhang, and both burst into laughter.</p><p>Their laughter echoed through the tunnels.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>Qin Sang's smile vanished, a soft "hmm" escaping his lips as his eyes, sharp as lightning, fixated on one side of the wall. Simultaneously, his true energy flowed powerfully into the treasure bell.</p><p>‘Ring! Ring! Ring!’</p><p>The treasure bell vibrated wildly, its sound urgent and piercing.</p><p>The treasure light suddenly surged, flooding towards the wall.</p><p>Under the illumination of the treasure light, the wall was revealed in exquisite detail.</p><p>The wall was smooth and even, seemingly bare, but after being covered by the treasure bell's light, the light itself seemed to warp strangely.</p><p>Then, on the grayish-black wall, some circular lines appeared, vaguely outlining a toad-shaped pattern only the size of a thumb.</p><p>The Stone Toad!</p><p>The instant it was revealed by the treasure light, the Stone Toad sensed danger, its hind legs moving slightly before the pattern on the wall vanished at incredible speed.</p><p>Shima wasn't simply disguised as a stone; it had completely merged with the stone wall, able to move freely within it, a master of earth遁術 (earth escape).  This was entirely unlike what Lu Zhang had described.</p><p>Shima was surprisingly fast when fleeing!</p><p>Lu Zhang reacted swiftly. The moment Qin Sang spotted Shima, Lu Zhang leaped in front of him, a green light shooting from his forehead, transforming into a small, green bell.  The bell expanded rapidly.</p><p>With a deafening *boom*, the stone wall shattered. Not only were several nearby tunnels pierced, but the surrounding walls were completely leveled by Lu Zhang's attack, the shockwave even affecting the levels above and below, shattering all connected rock formations.</p><p>Instantly, a man-made spherical cavity appeared underground.  Qin Sang and Lu Zhang worked in perfect coordination. As the wall was breached, the Baose Bell soared, its radiant light illuminating the area.</p><p>Rocks flew. Dust filled the air.  Shima's escape route was cut off, forcing it out of the stone. A faint purple glow flickered on its back; it was beginning its transformation into a Purple-Veined Toad, but they found it before the transformation was complete.</p><p>Shima flashed, merging with a stone, then rapidly hopped between stones, fleeing downwards. Unfortunately, it was already locked onto, unable to use illusionary techniques.</p><p>*Bang bang bang…*</p><p>Lu Zhang's bell, its power overwhelming, pulverized countless stones, creating a wide passage. The bell tilted slightly, aiming at Shima, firing a beam of eerie green light.</p><p>Shima was about to be captured when…</p><p>Suddenly, the dust below churned, a pale hand reaching out, grabbing Shima before the bell could.</p><p>The coveted treasure was within reach, yet an uninvited guest appeared.</p><p>Lu Zhang flew into a rage. "How dare you!"</p><p>The bell trembled violently, its weight immense, smashing towards the hand.</p><p>The strange-faced man appeared, following his hand.  He looked at the bell, a mocking smile on his lips, spitting out a wooden bead towards the bell while his hand firmly gripped Shima.</p><p>However, he didn't notice that the Baose Bell's light had dimmed. Qin Sang, seeing the danger, had decisively retracted the artifact capable of dispelling illusions, unable to assist.</p><p>The strange-faced man's smile froze. He looked down.  In his palm, instead of Shima, was a Spirit Illusion Flower. Its petals withered instantly, leaving only a seed.</p>
