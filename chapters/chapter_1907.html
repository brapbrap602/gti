<h1>Chapter 1898: Self-destruction!</h1><p>The whole world is against him!</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>No wonder the First Sword Attendant hadn't tried to recruit or threaten him; this was the greatest threat.</p><p>He bore the indelible mark of the Ziwei Emperor, a mark that wouldn't change due to his personal will.</p><p>At least for now, the First Sword Attendant and Tian Yue Shang Ren hadn't harmed him, instead bestowing many opportunities.</p><p>Without their help, he couldn't have advanced to the Refining Void stage so smoothly.</p><p>The First Sword Attendant's expression was calm and unperturbed, as if she had only made a joke.</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts, let out a breath, and continued to ask: "Senior, how do you plan to arrange for me? Continue sheltering me in the Dao Court, or send me back to the previous world, to hide in a smaller world and cultivate in seclusion, waiting for the time to return?"</p><p>"The Dao Court can barely look after itself, it cannot protect you. As for the previous world, you can't go back…"</p><p>The First Sword Attendant pondered for a moment, before saying: "Her final choice to send the Sword Pavilion and her sword into this world must have had unknown reasons; this world is definitely not an ordinary smaller world.  Years ago, I was drawn here, attempting to approach it, but felt a subtle unease, an instinctive sense of threat and apprehension; my perception was greatly affected, so I dared not force my way in. I searched for a long time before locating the Emperor Sword. In the end, to stop you, I had no choice but to take the risk and act. Without the Emperor Sword's aura to guide me, I would have already lost track of this world…"</p><p>As expected!</p><p>Qin Sang guessed the events of that year, but one doubt remained unresolved.</p><p>The First Sword Attendant was at least a Mahayana-stage expert, yet she used such a crude method to search for the sword spirit, only able to call out across the void.</p><p>Breaking through the barrier between worlds and searching a world, how much effort could that really take?</p><p>Could it be that a Mahayana-stage expert entering a smaller world would still be suppressed by the天道 (Heaven's Way) of that smaller world?</p><p>Moreover, Tian Yue Shang Ren clearly knew the First Sword Attendant for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that Tian Yue Shang Ren had once received a sword cultivation inheritance in the Immortal Palace, the 'Sword Pavilion' the First Sword Attendant mentioned, which attracted the First Sword Attendant's attention, and she might even have become her successor.</p><p>If so, why didn't Tian Yue Shang Ren tell her the location of the Storm World?</p><p>There was only one possibility: after Tian Yue Shang Ren ascended, she also couldn't find her way back!</p><p>Therefore, no one who ascended had ever returned to the Storm World.</p><p>"The First Sword Attendant and Tian Yue Shang Ren both cannot find the Storm World, what can I do?  Liuli, Qingyang Temple, my old friends in the Storm World…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes showed a look of melancholy.</p><p>He thought the altar in Mount Ju led to the Storm World, diligently exploring the altar, trying to find a way back, to fulfill his promise.</p><p>Unexpectedly, that path didn't exist!</p><p>The only comfort was that the Heavenly Dao's demonic sound that blocked his path was gone, and before he left, to show his feelings, he gave Liuli the superior Soul-Calming Incense and Tian Linglong's spirit embryo…</p><p>Hoping she could break through on her own, and they would meet again in the Greater Thousand World!</p><p>"In the River of Misfortune, there's always been a mysterious expert ferrying the boat. Cultivators who ascend from a smaller world, if they are unfortunately drawn into the River of Misfortune, will be taken into the Greater Thousand World…"</p><p>As she spoke, the First Sword Attendant's figure became increasingly faint.</p><p>She didn't say much more, believing that since Qin Sang had reached this point, he would understand the risks and didn't need others to tell him.</p><p>However, Qin Sang still had many questions.</p><p>The First Sword Attendant's figure quickly faded, and before disappearing, she remembered something and hesitated, saying: "That… cultivation technique… you need to be cautious in the future…"</p><p>Her voice was ethereal, her figure gone.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. Was she referring to the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*?</p><p>This cultivation technique couldn't be involved in some major karmic retribution, could it?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but mutter to himself.</p><p>The First Sword Attendant's tone and expression didn't seem to mean that; perhaps there were problems with the cultivation technique itself.</p><p>Cultivating demonic arts with a human body, Qin Sang had long anticipated that there would be hidden dangers.</p><p>However, the First Sword Attendant only reminded him to be cautious, not to stop cultivating it directly. Did this mean that the problem wasn't very serious, or that she wasn't sure herself?</p><p>…</p><p>"I have a body!"</p><p>"I have a body!"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts were interrupted by Zhuque's joyful cry.</p><p>After the First Sword Attendant left, Zhuque became arrogant again, flying in front of Qin Sang, raising a pair of small wings, spinning around in front of Qin Sang, showing off its round, fluffy little belly.</p><p>Legend says phoenixes dance beautifully; unfortunately, the young Zhuque spirit hadn't adapted to its new body yet, its movements stiff, lacking any beauty.</p><p>It had once vowed to take revenge on whoever pinched its neck, but it seemed to have completely forgotten.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, reminding it: "Your spirit was created using the True Feathers of the Heavenly Phoenix. Even if you only have half of those phoenix true flames, that’s still a huge amount. I also lost the Solar God Tree, a priceless treasure. Have you thought about how you'll compensate me?"</p><p>Zhuque was about to bristle, but its eyes rolled, and it raised its neck, behaving arrogantly, indifferent and brazenly said: "This Zhuque was forced! Dare you go to the real culprit…"</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A bolt of lightning from a clear sky.</p><p>A blood-red thunder appeared in the heavens, emitting a violent aura.</p><p>Zhuque shuddered, shrinking its neck before darting into Qin Sang's sleeve with a 'whoosh'.</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head helplessly, glanced at the now-powerless Sun God Tree, put it away, and looked up at the blood-red thunder in the sky with a grave expression.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The blood-red thunder was like writhing pythons, tearing through the void.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Suddenly, an incredibly thick bolt of blood-red thunder exploded, spanning the sky, seeming to pierce this realm, splitting the heavens.</p><p>This thunder lingered, then split into countless bloody lightning bolts, their eerie glow illuminating the world.</p><p>The heavens seemed to truly crack open, with a river of blood pouring in.</p><p>Following the moon, the thunder, the sun, and the starry sea, this realm witnessed a new celestial phenomenon.</p><p>For the creatures of this realm, this blood-red thunder was far more terrifying than anything before.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Suddenly, a torrential rain began to fall from the sky – blood-red rain.</p><p>The Four Regions were located below the river of blood, and the rain was heaviest there, but the blood rain was rapidly spreading, engulfing the entire realm!</p><p>The rain looked real, but it left no trace on the ground.</p><p>However, all living beings could feel a strong aura of death and violence, an instinctive terror driving them to flee the blood rain.</p><p>The drumbeats ceased, but ferocious beasts still lingered on the edges of the Evil Plains and Evil Sea. Sensing the blood rain, they fled in panic.</p><p>"The First Sword Servant claimed he would offer a Great Ascension Daoist field. Could this be a celestial phenomenon caused by the fall of a Great Ascension cultivator?"</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked. "They really killed a Great Ascension cultivator!"</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Suddenly, a beam of sword light parted the blood rain, cutting through the air and landing before Qin Sang.</p><p>The sword trembled slightly, revealing a young man in green robes.</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang, the youth smiled gently.  "Qin Sang, I'm very familiar with you.  Unfortunately, due to a twist of fate, you don't recognize me... My master named me Di Sha. Later, people mostly called me the Zi Wei Boy."</p><p>"Qin Sang greets Senior Di Sha."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>Perhaps due to spending a long time with the Di Sha sword, Qin Sang felt less constrained in front of the youth than she had with the First Sword Servant.</p><p>The youth said warmly, "There's no need to be so formal between us. Since you've inherited your master's legacy, you are my junior. I hope to see you, and I will help you carry on your master's will, overcome all difficulties, ascend to the peak of the Great Thousand World, and achieve immortality!  And, I also need your help to find the other fragments of my sword..."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Di Sha sword's main body, "Senior, do you mean the hilt?"</p><p>The youth nodded. "The hilt should have also been sent by the master to a certain sword pavilion. That pavilion was brought back to the Great Thousand World by those people using some method, but we don't know if it has been taken... Unfortunately, the power I've recovered has been depleted again, and I need to go back to sleep, so I can't help you much."</p><p>Pausing, the youth looked at Qin Sang's brow, "Summon your life-bound spiritual sword."</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Yun You sword as requested.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Yun You sword fell into the youth's hand, its sharpness concealed, lying quietly in his palm.</p><p>The youth gently stroked the sword, a look of reminiscence in his eyes. After hesitating, he softly asked, "Will you keep it?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, realizing the youth was referring to the sword spirit.</p><p>When a spiritual treasure's spiritual embryo gives birth to a sword spirit, it faces a transformation, with two choices.</p><p>One is to refine the sword spirit into the weapon, achieving a true treasure.</p><p>The other is to allow the sword spirit to be born, becoming a postnatal spiritual treasure.</p><p>To his knowledge, most sword cultivators choose the former, achieving a unity of self and sword, which better refines their sword heart!</p><p>"Of course!"</p><p>Qin Sang answered without hesitation.</p><p>The Yun You sword held the hope of Yun Youzi's resurrection, how could she give it up!</p><p>"Good! Good! Good!"</p><p>The youth said 'good' three times, raised a finger, and touched the sword.  A point of green light flew from his fingertip.</p><p>The green light, like water, flowed over the sword, slowly seeping into its interior.</p><p>Qin Sang was both surprised and delighted.</p><p>Having seen the First Sword Servant imbue Zhuque with a spirit, she had wanted to ask if he could help Yun Youzi be reborn, but the First Sword Servant had left too quickly. The youth, a powerful being and a sword spirit himself, should also have this ability.</p><p>She hurriedly explained the situation.</p><p>"It's alright. My actions are to help it transform sooner, it won't harm the spiritual embryo at all, nor will it have any adverse effect on your friend's true spirit. However..."</p><p>The youth pondered for a while, then continued, "No one knows if the sword spirit born from this mere transformation of the true spirit will still be your friend, or if it can regain its past memories..."</p><p>His tone was not optimistic.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, lost in thought.</p><p>Few understand spirit weapons better than the Green-robed Attendant; his judgment is practically infallible.</p><p>“If a transformed spirit weapon has no memory of its past, is it truly reborn?  Is this what Master Yunyou intended?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes showed worry, his heart filled with frustration.  He longed for the day he could share drinks with Master Yunyou.</p><p>Could there truly be no way to restore it?  Qin Sang gazed at the Yunyou Sword, secretly hoping the Attendant was wrong.</p><p>Green light flowed continuously from the Green-robed Attendant’s fingertips, merging into the sword.  The Yunyou Sword became increasingly clear, like the purest substance in the world.  The light trembled gently, as if a nascent spirit within was growing stronger, nourished by the green energy.</p><p>Finally, the green light faded.  The Attendant withdrew his finger, returning the Yunyou Sword to Qin Sang, his face weary. “Do not draw the sword until the spirit within has fully absorbed this energy.”</p><p>The Yunyou Sword, though not yet a blank, felt light as water.</p><p>“Thank you for your help,” Qin Sang bowed deeply, committing the advice to memory.  In fact, after learning the origin of the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* (chapter on cultivating sword spirits), Qin Sang resolved never to use the Yunyou Sword before others again!</p><p>“You seem to have other spirit weapon energies on you,” the Attendant remarked.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He produced the Five Elements Crown. “Senior, do you mean this?”</p><p>The Attendant nodded, summoning it closer.  After a moment of examination, he let out a soft exclamation, sensing the crown's unusual nature.</p><p>“Interesting… it formed a spirit body before undergoing the Heavenly Tribulation!”</p><p>He reached out, making a grasping motion towards the crown.  Five-colored light flashed, followed by a surge of black demonic energy.  The energy roiled, and the Attendant, after a moment's thought, reached into it directly.</p><p>Instantly, the demonic energy recoiled, forming a faint human silhouette within.  Qin Sang saw a girl who appeared to be six or seven years old, bearing a striking resemblance to the female cultivator possessed by the demon spirit years ago. Her eyes were closed, and she was asleep.</p><p>The Attendant supported the girl, the demonic energy flowing into her, making her form more solid.</p><p>“This is the spirit of the Five Elements Crown?” Qin Sang sensed the demonic energy still remained, though significantly suppressed compared to before.</p><p>“She is but a step away from transformation, but trapped by demonic energy. I have suppressed it.  You must work to dispel the remaining demonic energy; then she can undergo the tribulation and become a true innate spiritual treasure!”</p><p>His energy now weaker, the Attendant continued, “After entering the Greater Thousand World, don't forget this.  Restoring her original form will significantly speed my recovery.  Our master inscribed the sword manual onto fragments and sent them away with the Sword Pavilion. Finding the hilt will reveal the rest of the manual.”</p><p>The sword manual! Qin Sang was startled.  “Senior, you don’t know the techniques beyond the Unity stage?”  He had assumed the awakened sword spirit would impart the remaining techniques.</p><p>The Attendant shook his head.</p><p>“Our master never named this manual, feeling it was incomplete. The manual you practice differs significantly from what I remember; it seems to incorporate his final insights. The original manual…when you break through to the Unity stage, if you haven't found the rest, I should have recovered somewhat and can help you deduce it.  Your cultivation is too low; teaching it now would only disrupt your path.  However, understanding the path of killing will be relevant. By the Transformation stage, you should have some insights. Do you know what our master did at the Void Refinement stage?”</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently as the Attendant said gravely, “Kill those who deserve killing!”</p><p>This answer surprised Qin Sang. Who deserves death, and how does one judge?</p><p>“What about the Unity stage?” Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>“Kill oneself!”</p><p>The Attendant’s answer was unexpected again. He was economical with words, offering only guidance, leaving interpretation to Qin Sang.  Anything else would be inappropriate.</p><p>Seeing the Attendant preparing to return to his slumber, Qin Sang hastily asked one last question.</p><p>“Does the sword manual contain any secret techniques?”  Without the Jade Buddha, he couldn't practice the manual.  Without secret techniques, forcefully cultivating it would have dire consequences, as demonstrated by Senior Qingzhu. The power of the Thunder Deity had pushed the Jade Buddha to its limits.  Qin Sang realized he couldn't rely solely on it and needed to prepare for the future.</p><p>The Attendant’s expression shifted to one of reverence and pride.</p><p>“Our master cultivated the path of killing, walked the path of corpses, and traversed the sea of blood. What need did he have for secret techniques!”</p><p>As he vanished, the Attendant gave Qin Sang a lingering look.  This was why they valued Qin Sang so much.  How many in the world possessed the mindset and willpower to fully cultivate this sword manual?</p><p>They could only hope he would not disappoint them.</p><p>(End)</p>
