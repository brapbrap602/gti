<h1>Chapter 1984: Moon渎 Bay</h1><p>Justice transcends personal grievances.</p><p>With the flourishing of the Great Vehicle path, demons and monsters are restrained, apprehensive, and dare not slaughter innocent civilians indiscriminately.</p><p>Order is not a bad thing, but some certainly dislike it and refuse to be constrained.</p><p>Just as heroes emerge during times of chaos, great opportunities often arise from disorder—the so-called "children of destiny."</p><p>Yun Du Tian, self-proclaimed leader of the righteous path, their actions toward ordinary mortals are far from righteous.</p><p>If Gu Yun Sou and Qin Sang were both killed, the destruction of Yun Du Tian wouldn't be unjustified.</p><p>However, Qin Sang isn't certain he can kill both at once.</p><p>Cultivators at the Refinement Void stage are cautious and cherish their lives.  Even when competing for the bronze pillar, it’s unlikely they’d both be fatally wounded.</p><p>If Qin Sang attacked during their fight, they would inevitably join forces to retaliate.  The Four Symbols Sword Array wouldn't hold them.</p><p>In that case, activating the Thunder Altar would alert them, allowing them to escape.  Qin Sang would be helpless.</p><p>Even if they couldn't escape the Thunder Altar's range, combining their efforts to resist the sacrificial lightning oath would greatly weaken its power.</p><p>Furthermore, the Thunder Altar can't be activated repeatedly. Even if it could, Qin Sang wouldn't be able to. The energy consumption from a single activation is already extremely taxing.</p><p>Failing to kill them instantly would lead to an endless feud.</p><p>Qin Sang fears no powerful enemy, but failure would mean missing a golden opportunity.</p><p>A clash between two major forces leads to great turmoil, deep-seated resentment, and widespread suffering in the human world.  His emergence to turn the tide and save the people would be a perfect demonstration of the Dao.</p><p>He won't be able to lure them again.  Qin Sang alone doesn't have the strength to kill Refinement Void cultivators, which would hinder his cultivation.</p><p>He’ll exploit the distrust between Gu Yun Sou and Ming Hu Lao Zu, divide them, restrain one, trap the other, a strategy of deception.</p><p>The destruction of Fallen Soul Abyss and the intimidation of Yun Du Tian have already achieved Qin Sang's goals.</p><p>Keeping Gu Yun Sou alive isn't useless.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Gu Yun Sou, deliberately projecting an image of having a powerful backing and extensive influence.</p><p>Clearly, Gu Yun Sou is intimidated.</p><p>He’s not a carefree wanderer.  Having a sect means having reservations.</p><p>Unless Qin Sang intends to destroy Yun Du Tian, Gu Yun Sou won't dare to fight to the death.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou serves as Qin Sang’s introduction to the vast world.</p><p>Meeting Qin Sang’s gaze, Gu Yun Sou's heart skipped a beat, but his expression remained calm as he continued explaining how to break the formation.</p><p>With Ming Hu Lao Zu dead, and no Refinement Void cultivator guarding Fallen Soul Abyss, the protective formation's power is significantly weakened, posing little threat.</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang, finding no omissions, nodded and vanished into a ravine.</p><p>The ravine was deep and long, teeming with life.  As he descended, Qin Sang saw lush forests covering the cliff walls, stretching to the bottom.</p><p>Specks of fluorescence were scattered among the foliage, painting the ravine interior a verdant green.</p><p>The fluorescence came from the leaves of a special plant resembling vines, abundant everywhere, serving as the underground light source.</p><p>They moved like living things, their tendrils acting as feelers, climbing between branches.</p><p>The deeper he went, the dimmer the fluorescence became, until he entered a world of darkness.</p><p>Fallen Soul Abyss's gate was located in the middle section.</p><p>Qin Sang and Gu Yun Sou took positions north and south of the gate, unnoticed by the remaining Fallen Soul Abyss followers.</p><p>The power of the formation manifested, strange black mist shrouding Fallen Soul Abyss. The mist swirled, accompanied by howling winds, adding to the eerie atmosphere.</p><p>Beneath the mist were frightened faces and dozens of suspended black coffins.</p><p>These coffins emanated a dark aura, their energies interconnected. The strange black mist seeped from the cracks in the coffins, forming the protective formation.</p><p>"Truly worthy of the Corpse Demons, using coffins for their protective formation,"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, then his eyes lit up as streams of light descended from the sky, illuminating the underworld.</p><p>Yun Du Tian cultivators, following Gu Yun Sou's orders, arrived to break the formation.</p><p>They were eager and rushed down, led by the Nine Immortals of Yun Du, attacking the formation from nine different directions.</p><p>The cultivators' spells and magical artifacts formed nine colorful torrents.  The remaining Fallen Soul Abyss followers found nothing beautiful in the scene.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Like nine heavenly waterfalls, they continuously bombarded the formation.</p><p>The black mist churned, the black coffins swayed, and the chains suspending them clattered.</p><p>The hearts of the Fallen Soul Abyss remnants trembled along with the chains.</p><p>"Yun Xi, you dare act so recklessly! When our master returns, you will be refined into a corpse puppet, your soul sealed, condemning you to eternal damnation!"</p><p>A shrill scream echoed from below.</p><p>Yun Xi let out a cold laugh.</p><p>"That old zombie slaughtered countless lives.  Karma caught up with him; he's long dead.  We'll have to summon him from the underworld!"</p><p>"You corpse demons, feeding on yin energy, sacrificing people... you deserve to be thrown into hell and tortured! The mortal realm cannot tolerate you! Let us send you back to the underworld to reunite with that old zombie!"</p><p>Yun Xi's cold shout echoed into the Falling Soul Abyss, causing an uproar.</p><p>Those who had spoken earlier tried their best to calm everyone, but it was futile.  Before the mountain-protecting array was even breached, their own ranks were in disarray.</p><p>Ancestor Ming Hu had yet to appear to repel the enemy.  No matter how unbelievable it was, they couldn't change the fact.</p><p>Under the fierce attack of the Nine Immortals of Yun City, the mountain-protecting array was forced to undergo drastic changes. Qin Sang and Gu Yun Sou observed this, quickly grasping the array's workings.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Purple light and sword energy erupted simultaneously at both ends of the array.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou raised his purple bamboo staff, pointed it at the void before him, and struck heavily.  The staff tip felt like a sledgehammer.</p><p>Purple streaks of light rapidly spread through the strange black mist, tearing it apart.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless, a sword beam shooting from his sleeve.</p><p>The Grey Sparrow Sword flew out, instantly transforming into a sword light, aimed at the Falling Soul Abyss.  Without any flourish, it slashed down from the air!</p><p>*Rumbling…*</p><p>The cliff walls on both sides trembled violently.</p><p>The black mist churned wildly, finally succumbing under the combined assault of Qin Sang and Gu Yun Sou.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>To the horror of the Falling Soul Abyss's remaining followers, more than a dozen black coffins shattered almost simultaneously, their fragments falling to the ground, leaving only swaying iron chains.</p><p>The coffins shattered at an astonishing rate.  Once a third remained, the array became unsustainable.</p><p>*Swish swish swish!*</p><p>Yun City's cultivators, shouting to slay demons and eliminate evil, charged into the Falling Soul Abyss like wolves.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang and Gu Yun Sou had entered the depths of the Falling Soul Abyss, standing by the Black River.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>Qin Sang threw a man to the ground.</p><p>The man's expression was surprisingly calm, though the ripples in his eyes betrayed his inner turmoil.</p><p>He fell to his knees, "Junior Jing Zang greets both senior masters."</p><p>Gu Yun Sou recognized Jing Zang and chuckled, "This fellow is the old zombie's favorite disciple, quite cunning and highly favored.  This upheaval in the human world was his plan. Luckily, we sealed off the Falling Soul Abyss early, otherwise, this fellow would have escaped."</p><p>"Please, senior masters, I was trapped in the demonic lair, powerless, completely controlled by that old demon.  I was forced to act."</p><p>Jing Zang was anxious, unable to discern Gu Yun Sou's intentions.</p><p>These Nascent Soul masters were high and mighty, but sects needed someone to manage affairs.  Perhaps he could use his cunning to save his life.  "Senior masters, spare my life, and I will do my utmost to repay your great kindness."</p><p>He added, "I followed the old demon for many years and know quite a bit about the secrets of the Falling Soul Abyss."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around.  Several stone manors stood on either side of the Black River, likely the Falling Soul Abyss's treasure vaults.</p><p>Ancestor Ming Hu had been operating for years, his resources certainly extended beyond this. The secret realms and medicinal fields outside the mountain, controlled by the Falling Soul Abyss, each represented immense wealth.</p><p>More than enough to strengthen the Green Sheep Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Jing Zang and said calmly, "Open your mind."</p><p>Jing Zang's face turned ashen, his lips trembled, but he dared not resist as Qin Sang implanted a restrictive enchantment into his body, merging it with his soul.</p><p>He was now at their mercy.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou produced a pouch and gave it to Qin Sang. It contained the spoils of war, which Qin Sang readily accepted.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Black River splashed, revealing stone steps.</p><p>The two descended the steps, finding a vast stone chamber at the riverbed, more like a tomb.  Strange murals adorned the walls.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou, entering the Falling Soul Abyss for the first time, examined the murals carefully.  "The Falling Soul Abyss's first ancestor was buried here – an ancient corpse, incorruptible for ten thousand years. It gained sentience and enlightenment, emerging with overwhelming demonic energy. Our ancestors tried to slay the demon, fought several times, but couldn't kill it, watching it establish its sect here and becoming a major threat."</p><p>His voice softened, his gaze fixed on the murals.</p><p>The murals were indistinct, the paint seemingly faded by time, with several sections peeled away.</p><p>The patterns were simple yet profound.</p><p>Gu Yunshou immediately recognized the unusual nature of the mural.  Ancestor Minghu's fall meant his belongings, including this, ended up in Qin Sang's hands.  He'd assumed the cave held little of value, but this mural was a surprise.</p><p>Gu Yunshou was about to become engrossed when he abruptly came to his senses.  He glanced at Qin Sang, whose gaze was also captivated by the mural, showing no sign of wanting him to leave.</p><p>Unsure of Qin Sang's intentions but unable to resist the mural's allure, Gu Yunshou decided not to overthink it and focused his attention on studying it.</p><p>“So that's it…”</p><p>Gu Yunshou murmured.</p><p>The fundamental cultivation techniques of the Luohun Abyss must be deeply connected to this mural; perhaps even the Luohun Abyss ancestor developed them after studying the mural and incorporating other methods.</p><p>After some time, he sighed inwardly. The mural’s content mostly related to body refinement, greatly beneficial to physical cultivators, but not compatible with the Yun Du Mountain lineage.</p><p>Gu Yunshou looked at Qin Sang again, unable to read his expression.  This man cultivated both his body and his spirit; for him, this mural's value likely surpassed most of Ancestor Minghu's treasures.</p><p>He wondered if this man had obtained the complete Luohun Abyss inheritance.  The Yun Du Heaven sect's extermination of the corpse demons only yielded lower-level cultivation techniques; the most crucial part remained with Ancestor Minghu.  That must have contained the ancestor's insights from studying the mural; just that alone justified eliminating Ancestor Minghu.</p><p>Unaware of Gu Yunshou's many deductions, Qin Sang was also pondering the matter.  He did possess the Luohun Abyss inheritance, but had only glanced at it, lacking the time for a thorough study.</p><p>In his estimation, patient study of the mural held the highest chance of unlocking bone-tempering techniques.</p><p>His practice of *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* increasingly emphasized the spirit form, rather than pure body refinement. Qin Sang felt that continued cultivation in this method might drain his vital energy, completely merging it with the spirit form.</p><p>Cultivating another body refinement technique, balancing body and spirit form, might lead to significant improvement.  However, too many cultivation methods might not be ideal.</p><p>The Four-象 Sword Formation, thunder techniques, the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*…</p><p>How much energy and time could he spare?  Nascent Soul cultivators are free from lifespan worries, but face the tribulation.</p><p>He was spread too thin!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed quietly, hesitated, put the matter aside temporarily, withdrew his gaze, noticed a stone table and chairs in the cave, and went to sit down.</p><p>“Please have a seat, Daoist friend.”</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, acting like the host. In fact, he was the master here now; Gu Yunshou had decided not to contest the Luohun Abyss inheritance with him.</p><p>“Daoist wishes to play a game of Go with this old man?”</p><p>Gu Yunshou looked around, settling down with a chuckle.  At least Qin Sang’s demeanor didn't overtly indicate hostility toward him or the Yun Du Heaven sect.</p><p>“This humble cultivator is not skilled in Go.”</p><p>Qin Sang said casually, his finger brushing against his storage ring, releasing a dozen jade slips which he placed on the table.</p><p>“How many ancient array ruins did your sect unearth in the Fire Domain?”</p><p>Gu Yunshou looked at the jade slips, knowing they contained imprints from the fragments of the Panlong Ancient Array left in those ruins. These were precisely what the Jitian Sect needed.</p><p>However, fragments alone were insufficient. They needed to piece them together, connecting all the ruins to activate and trigger the Panlong Ancient Array's first transformation – only then would they be worthwhile.</p><p>“Thirteen ruins in total, not all completely copied. However, all these together are not worth a single Panlong Heavenly Pillar.”</p><p>“Is this what you mean?”</p><p>Qin Sang produced the bronze pillar.  A mere lure, yet of unexpectedly great value.</p><p>“Precisely!”</p><p>Gu Yunshou nodded.  “The Panlong Heavenly Pillar is the Panlong Ancient Array’s most important component.  The Jitian Sect desires to recreate it and thus needs many of these pillars.”</p><p>“The Panlong Ancient Array! A single ruin covers the entire Fire Domain. What an immense ancient array!  The grandeur of the ancient cultivation world truly makes one yearn for it…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone seemed purely contemplative.</p><p>Gu Yunshou, without suspicion, echoed, “Indeed, otherwise why would the Jitian Sect value it so highly? The Panlong Ancient Array's ruins lay dormant for countless years, emerging unexpectedly, and for unknown reasons. To restore it, the Jitian Sect has mobilized its resources, dispatching disciples to search the Yue Du Bay for thousands of years. They've been here multiple times, but never imagined the Fire Domain held one such ruin.”</p><p>“Even with the entire Yue Du Bay cultivation world mobilized by the Jitian Sect, fewer and fewer new ruins are being found, still not meeting the Jitian Sect’s requirements. It's said that the rewards at the upcoming Jitian Sect Assembly are incredibly lavish. I offer my advance congratulations to you and the Qingyang Temple.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved, giving a noncommittal hum, examining the Panlong Heavenly Pillar with an indifferent air. He didn't inquire further, only possessing hearsay knowledge of the Jitian Sect Assembly.</p><p>Participation reportedly required approval from the Jitian Sect; only acknowledged Yue Du Bay factions received formal invitations.</p><p>Gu Yunshou probed further, expressing his envy, “It’s said that among the treasures the Jitian Sect will offer is a small pocket dimension!”</p>
