<h1>Chapter 745: Blood Moon Formation</h1><p>Chapter 745: Blood Moon Formation</p><p>“Look! What’s that?!”</p><p>As midnight approached, just as everyone was wondering why the magical formation was completely still, someone spotted something unusual and pointed towards the center of the hurricane, exclaiming in surprise.</p><p>Behind the gray wind wall, a point of blood-red light had appeared at some point.</p><p>The light’s position was clearly deep within the hurricane, yet those outside could see it with perfect clarity—and it was incredibly vibrant!</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed slightly.  He sensed an unusual occurrence and knew that the attempt to break the formation had likely begun.</p><p>“Take out your jade pendants. They will offer protection; otherwise, we won’t be able to move an inch within the formation.”</p><p>Following Xiang Yi’s orders, everyone produced their jade pendants.</p><p>At that moment, Xiang Yi suddenly cast a talisman, flicking his finger, causing the talisman to ignite without flame. A transparent thread shot out, landing on each person's jade pendant.</p><p>Everyone was alert but unable to stop the threads.</p><p>“Xiang Daoyou, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>The young man with the sword frowned and questioned him coldly.</p><p>Xiang Yi smiled slightly. “Don’t worry, everyone. I’m simply concerned that you might encounter unexpected problems while breaking through the formation and become separated.  We all know time is of the essence, and you certainly wouldn’t want to waste time searching for each other inside, right? The Seven Killing Hall is vast; once separated, regrouping will be difficult. I will remove the talismans later.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned inwardly, using his spiritual sense to detect the threads but unable to discern their nature.</p><p>This mission was supposedly connected to the leader of the East Pole Alliance.  Unless they intended to leave the Seven Killing Hall and openly defy the Alliance, no one present dared to break their word.</p><p>The East Pole Alliance was a colossal force, its influence spread throughout the world, and its leader was a top-tier expert.</p><p>Both righteous and demonic cultivators, along with other trade alliances, would readily give face to the leader.  To anger him would make movement impossible, whether in the Inner Sea or the Demon Sea.</p><p>However, it wasn't impossible that someone would be audacious enough to escape during the attempt to break through.</p><p>The jade pendants were extremely fragile, shattering easily at a touch. If Xiang Yi wanted to secretly sabotage them, it would be child’s play. By openly attaching the threads, he was likely issuing a warning.</p><p>As long as it didn't hinder his search for the ancient teleportation array, Qin Sang didn't want to risk angering the East Pole Alliance and therefore ignored the threads.</p><p>Although the others were dissatisfied, they all endured it.</p><p>After this brief episode, everyone noticed that the blood-red light had risen slowly from the heart of the hurricane, like a blood moon hanging high in the sky, directly facing the hurricane.</p><p>At that moment, without warning, the blood moon shattered.</p><p>Countless fragments of the blood moon exploded.</p><p>Instantly, dazzling blood-red light erupted, descending from the heavens and striking the heart of the hurricane. A strange, invisible wave suddenly burst forth from the center of the hurricane, instantly sweeping across all directions.</p><p>Everyone was shocked by the wave's impact, their minds trembling. They stared fixedly at the hurricane, without blinking.</p><p>“Blood Moon Formation.”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured softly, recalling the scene of the small Beichen Star Yuan Formation breaking the magical array years ago.</p><p>Unfortunately, the hurricane obscured the impact of the blood-red light on the magical formation; the inside remained a chaotic blur, impossible to see through.</p><p>The strange waves continued to erupt.  While lacking any earth-shattering sound, they were deeply unsettling.</p><p>“The wind wall has cracked! The formation is broken; let’s go!”</p><p>Someone suddenly shouted.</p><p>Qin Sang looked closely. The originally seamless gray wind wall had, at some point, developed a crack.</p><p>The turbulence from the center of the hurricane spread, and after the first crack appeared, the entire wind wall suddenly shattered into pieces, with countless large and small cracks crisscrossing each other.</p><p>The hurricane seemed on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The underwater vortex was also turbulent.</p><p>At that moment, the surrounding wind had actually weakened considerably, even experiencing a brief moment of calm.</p><p>Xiang Yi was no slower than anyone else.  Seeing the cracks, he immediately ordered a charge.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others followed closely behind.  With a few blinks, they arrived before the wind wall, chose a small crack, and hesitated before charging through.</p><p>After entering the crack, their vision narrowed. Gray gas filled the space; nothing else was visible, and the location of the Seven Killing Hall's formation was unknown.</p><p>However, the jade pendants would guide them.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others followed Xiang Yi's instructions and stayed close to him.</p><p>Shortly after entering, the restrictions within the jade pendants spontaneously activated, seemingly connecting with something at the center of the hurricane. Eight beams of blood-red light shot forward and instantly enveloped them.</p><p>“Blood Moon light. This must be the power of the spiritual formation Xiang Yi mentioned—protection for us all.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded subtly.</p><p>After the bloody light enveloped them, the terrifying pressure vanished. The light had shielded them from the hurricane's onslaught.</p><p>They pressed onward. The scenery remained unchanged—a monotonous gray—but the bloody light intensified, clearly indicating unknown changes outside.</p><p>The light became increasingly blinding, making it almost impossible to see beyond it.</p><p>In such a place, they dared not unleash their spiritual sense to probe their surroundings.</p><p>They could only follow the jade pendant's guidance and silently proceed.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A terrifying force suddenly appeared ahead, violently crashing into them.</p><p>The bloody light trembled, creating intense fluctuations.</p><p>Those within the light felt utterly helpless, able only to watch anxiously, fearing its shattering.</p><p>Fortunately, the fluctuations came and went quickly, and the bloody light regained its calm.</p><p>But the respite was short-lived.  Soon, new impacts arrived, stronger than before, relentlessly wave after wave.</p><p>The bloody light was frequently bombarded, becoming somewhat thinner, allowing Qin Sang to vaguely see the outside. To his astonishment, it appeared that water waves were assaulting them.</p><p>The spirit stones were well spent. Without the jade pendant, he wouldn't have been able to penetrate the Immortal Array with his own strength.</p><p>Although seemingly thin, the bloody light remained incredibly strong, protecting them, maintaining the formation's integrity.</p><p>Gradually, everyone felt reassured.</p><p>"We should be nearing the end of the Immortal Array,"</p><p>Qin Sang silently calculated the time, confirming it with previously obtained information.  It was about right.</p><p>"The Seven Killing Hall, the Ziwei Palace... what is the relationship between the two? Is the ancient teleportation array really in the Sky Tower? After fifty years of waiting, I'm finally inside.  Hopefully, I can find something useful..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, lost in thought, then suddenly lowered his head, staring intently at the Qianjun Ring on his hand, his face revealing immense surprise.</p><p>A moment ago, the Qianjun Ring had emitted unusual fluctuations.</p><p>He swept his spiritual sense across it and discovered that the two fused sections of the bone flute were glowing brightly, pointing towards his left.</p><p>After the fusion, no matter how Qin Sang manipulated it, the bone flute had remained unresponsive.  This phenomenon was unprecedented.</p><p>This clear guidance was even more so.</p><p>"It's calling out!"</p><p>Qin Sang was incredibly surprised. "Is it another section of the bone flute, or something else? Why wasn't there this reaction when I encountered the second section?"</p>
