<h1>Chapter 579: Ambush</h1><p>“The hidden restriction I left at the entrance has been triggered,” Yun Youzi whispered.</p><p>“Unlike human cultivators, demon beasts below the Transformation stage require Emperor Flow Nectar to fully awaken their intelligence.</p><p>“In the Heavenly Demon Mound, the Emperor Flow Nectar is controlled by the Demon Kings. Therefore, intelligent demon beasts in the Demon Core stage are mostly under the command of a Demon King.  Rarely are there rogue cultivators at the Gold Core stage like human cultivators.</p><p>“This demon beast is likely a confidant of a Demon King, having entered the inner hall with them. That's why it arrived so quickly.</p><p>“The raid on the Abyss of Sin has had a significant impact. The Three Domains are about to descend into chaos, and the Heavenly Demon Mound can no longer remain isolated. Those Demon Kings are probably thinking of going to the Heavenly Mountain early to secure more treasures, without lingering in the outer hall…”</p><p>The raid on the Abyss of Sin was an opportunity for them, but it also introduced uncertainty.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the cliff, his eyes cold. He took out the Void Thunder from his storage ring, but Yun Youzi stopped him.</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head gently and said in a deep voice, “We don't know the strength of this demon beast yet, nor how many have come. This is not the place to fight. I need to leave a mark first, ascertain its cultivation level, and then decide.”</p><p>Yun Youzi looked around, then suddenly jumped into the deep pool.</p><p>The water in the pool parted automatically. Yun Youzi's movements were very careful, preventing any traces of his presence from remaining.</p><p>They had been doing this all along, anticipating this situation, clearing away any residual aura, so they wouldn't be discovered by demon beasts entering later.</p><p>Yun Youzi stayed in the pool for a while before emerging, having left some unknown mark.</p><p>“Break the restriction!”</p><p>Yun Youzi said, “We can’t stop now. We must move forward as fast as possible. If this demon beast's cultivation level is high, the effectiveness of the Void Thunder and the Night Devil is uncertain.  The Void Thunder's range is too small, and the Night Devil's strength is limited. We may need to rely on the ancient restrictions to scare it away."</p><p>Qin Sang knew Yun Youzi was right. While his methods could indeed threaten a Demon Core stage demon beast, they had significant limitations and required careful planning to be effective.</p><p>His understanding of the ancient herb garden and the ancient restrictions was far less than Yun Youzi's, so he followed Yun Youzi's instructions without question. The Night Devil opened a passage, and Qin Sang and Yun Youzi jumped through without hesitation.</p><p>Ahead, ancient restrictions blocked their path; behind, pursuers.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi moved even faster than before, not daring to stop, breaking through the ancient restrictions at top speed, venturing deeper into the ancient herb garden.</p><p>They continued straight towards the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, without detouring or hiding.</p><p>Not to mention the unknown dangers lurking in the restrictions of other areas, there was only one Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.  Avoiding it would be equivalent to handing it over to someone else.</p><p>After breaking through four layers of ancient restrictions, they arrived at a hillside covered in wildflowers.</p><p>Yun Youzi stopped and suddenly smiled, his expression relaxed. "It's a Golden Eagle demon beast. I remember its cultivation is only at the early Demon Core stage, and it's injured. It's nothing to worry about!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to relax and quickly asked, "Only one Golden Eagle?"</p><p>"That's right," Yun Youzi nodded. "It was too chaotic when the Abyss of Sin was raided.  Since you, Brother Qin, weren't in the formation, you probably didn't notice.  When the Abyss of Sin left, they shattered a corner of the Lesser North Star Formation, right where the Heavenly Demon Mound's cultivators were stationed.  The demon beasts suffered heavy casualties, and those who survived were all injured. I remember this Golden Eagle; its cultivation is limited.  We won't even need your Void Thunder. We can easily trap it using the power of the ancient restrictions."</p><p>The two discussed briefly and then continued forward.</p><p>…</p><p>The ancient herb garden was vast, containing many large spaces sealed off by ancient restrictions.</p><p>Mountains rose and fell, vegetation lush and green.</p><p>A scene of vibrant life.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud eagle's cry pierced the air, followed by a flash of golden lightning.</p><p>The golden lightning instantly flew over several mountain peaks and landed on a protruding rock, revealing its true form—a Golden Eagle!</p><p>The Golden Eagle folded its wings. It was magnificent, with sharp, fierce eyes and golden feathers that seemed to be gilded.  However, it wasn't as large as typical Golden Eagles, which could have a wingspan of dozens of meters.</p><p>Its wingspan was about the size of a human.</p><p>Nevertheless, this Golden Eagle's aura was incredibly powerful, and its eyes were exceptionally bright, shining with intelligence not possessed by ordinary beasts.</p><p>It stood on the rock, gazing at the ravine ahead.</p><p>After a moment, a strange look appeared in the Golden Eagle's eyes, and it opened its beak, spitting out a bolt of lightning.</p><p>The sound of thunder echoed through the mountains.</p><p>This was a true lightning bolt, condensed from the Golden Eagle's demon power, incredibly powerful and incredibly fast.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when the lightning reached the ravine, it encountered resistance.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A Bagua symbol appeared amidst the loud noise, clearly a manifestation of the ancient restriction's power.</p><p>The golden lightning struck the center of the Bagua symbol, but it dissipated without even shaking it.</p><p>The next moment, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>The Bagua symbol began to rotate rapidly. A golden light appeared at its center and shot out an identical lightning bolt towards the Golden Eagle.</p><p>The ancient restriction had reflected the golden lightning, doubling its power!</p><p>A flicker of disdain crossed the Golden Eagle's eyes. With a flap of its wings, it shattered the lightning bolt. Then, it shook its body, countless feathers detaching and shooting out like sharp arrows.</p><p>In an instant, countless golden lights engulfed the Bagua symbol.</p><p>A 'crack' was heard as a tiny fissure appeared in the Bagua symbol.  The next moment, a golden light seized the opportunity and passed through the crack.</p><p>Intense pressure remained within the crack of the Bagua symbol. The Golden Eagle, its bones aching from the pressure, endured the pain and squeezed through the Bagua symbol.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as it emerged from the other side of the ancient restriction, a white light descended from the sky.</p><p>The white light appeared gentle, lacking any terrifying aura.</p><p>Yet, for some reason, the Golden Eagle felt a sense of foreboding from it.</p><p>At this moment, half of the Golden Eagle's body was still trapped within the ancient restriction. It hadn't anticipated an ambush here.</p><p>The Golden Eagle shrieked in surprise. Reacting swiftly, it spat out a lightning bolt and, as if releasing some kind of seal, its body suddenly grew larger.</p><p>Its bones creaked as they expanded.</p><p>As its size increased dramatically, a wound on the base of the Golden Eagle's left wing was exposed and split open, spraying blood. The air filled with the metallic scent.</p><p>This was an old wound, reopened by the pressure of the ancient restriction.</p><p>The injury had been inflicted by debris from the shattered Lesser North Star Formation, nearly costing it its life. Even after consuming numerous spirit pills, it hadn't fully healed.  The Demon King had intervened to stabilize its condition, but now the hidden injury had worsened.</p><p>The Golden Eagle screamed, enraged.</p><p>Ignoring its injury, it spread its wings forcefully, using brute strength to widen the crack in the ancient restriction.</p><p>In an instant, the Golden Eagle broke free.</p>
