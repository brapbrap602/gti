<h1>Chapter 666: Six-Petal Butterfly Violet</h1><p>After a while, the female cultivator returned with the spiritual herbs Qin Sang needed and brought good news.</p><p>“South of Pingbo Harbor, there’s a place called Black Gold Mountain. It’s said that deep within the mountain range lies a rift valley, and within that rift valley, there exists Earthly Yin Qi. However, Black Gold Mountain is very chaotic and unsafe. Senior, please be careful…”</p><p>The female cultivator handed the spiritual herbs and a detailed map to Qin Sang, kindly reminding him.</p><p>Qin Sang took the map and found that Black Gold Mountain wasn't too far from Pingbo Harbor, located at the edge of Pingbo Harbor's sphere of influence. Traveling at full speed, he could reach it in seven or eight days.</p><p>A round trip, plus the time needed for corpse refinement, wouldn't delay the departure date of the Qiongyu Trading Company.</p><p>Black Gold Mountain was a vast, unclaimed territory. Although there were some witch tribes around, none were powerful. As long as he was careful, he wouldn't need to worry about being besieged.</p><p>“Thank you for your concern, fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Qin Sang carefully put away the map and checked the spiritual herbs.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang discovered that although there were many spiritual herbs, several of the most valuable ones on the list, including Soul-Guiding Grass, were missing.</p><p>“Are spiritual herbs truly this scarce in the Canglang Sea Region? Such a large trading company, even possessing magical treasures, yet lacking Soul-Guiding Grass?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered inwardly, dissatisfied, “Fellow Daoist, are you afraid that this poor Daoist can't afford the spirit stones? The absence of Eternal Camphorwood is understandable, but not a single Soul-Guiding Grass?”</p><p>Seeing the hint of anger in Qin Sang's tone, the female cultivator was startled and quickly explained.</p><p>“Senior, please allow this junior to explain.</p><p>“In the Canglang Sea, the rarest spiritual herbs are those that aid cultivation, and Soul-Guiding Grass happens to assist demonic cultivators.  Long ago, Soul-Guiding Grass from the outside world was completely plundered by demonic sects.</p><p>“Not only does our company not have any, but even if Senior were to visit some of the top trading companies under the East Pole Alliance, you would need luck to even find a single stalk.</p><p>“Although beast cores can now be used to refine some cultivation-enhancing pills, they are not as effective as naturally grown spiritual herbs and have side effects. To this day, demonic sects are still actively collecting such spiritual herbs, and the top trading companies have intricate connections with them.  Once a spiritual herb is discovered, it's bought before the news even spreads…”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned upon hearing this, feeling troubled.</p><p>Beast cores were not as rare in the Canglang Sea Region. With sufficient Soul-Guiding Grass, he could refine more Flying Night Demons. Although limited by his divine sense, he couldn't control too many Flying Night Demons at once, but they would serve well as cannon fodder in dangerous situations.</p><p>Without Soul-Guiding Grass, there would be no Celestial Corpse Talismans, and thus no way to refine living corpses.</p><p>Without living corpses, there would be no Flying Night Demons.</p><p>While this didn't affect refining Yin Corpses, at his level of cultivation, even Yin Corpses refined by Core Formation cultivators were insufficient, not even qualified to be cannon fodder.</p><p>Unfortunately, he only possessed the first half of the *Celestial Yin Corpse Manual*.</p><p>“Before finding more Soul-Guiding Grass, I need to conserve these three Celestial Corpse Talismans. At least one must be kept in reserve.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Yagu's situation made Qin Sang realize that Celestial Corpse Talismans could at least offer a glimmer of hope. If such a situation arose again, he wouldn't be helpless, forced to watch his loved ones die.</p><p>The female cultivator secretly observed Qin Sang and, seeing his expression soften slightly, felt relieved.</p><p>She secretly speculated that Qin Sang was so eager to find Soul-Guiding Grass, could he be a demonic cultivator?</p><p>She had heard that Soul-Guiding Grass was most effective on Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators, but she didn't know if he was collecting it for his juniors or if he was cultivating some demonic art that required the herb.</p><p>Besides Soul-Guiding Grass, the most troublesome spiritual herb was called Six-Petal Butterfly Violet.</p><p>This herb was used in small quantities in the formula for cultivating Skyeye Butterflies but was the most crucial ingredient.</p><p>Most of the spiritual herbs required in the formula were available at the Four Seas Trading Company. However, without Six-Petal Butterfly Violet, the effects would be greatly reduced, slowing down the growth of the Skyeye Butterflies.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had inquired with the female cultivator, and Six-Petal Butterfly Violet wasn't a cultivation-enhancing spiritual herb like Soul-Guiding Grass, so not many factions were competing for it. With careful searching, it could still be found.</p><p>After paying the spirit stones, Qin Sang left the Four Seas Trading Company. He didn't rush to the Qiongyu Trading Company but instead found a random inn and rented a small courtyard.</p><p>Activating the restrictive formations, Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the ground, flipped his palm, and took out the Demonic Beast Core Pill.</p><p>The Demonic Beast Core Pill had five colors representing the five elements, but because it was refined from beast cores, regardless of the type, it had a faint blood-red hue. Opening the jade bottle, a pungent, fishy odor assaulted his nose, far more unpleasant than Foundation Establishment Pills.</p><p>Qin Sang endured the stench, poured out a pill, observed it for a moment, and swallowed it.</p><p>This was the lowest grade of Demonic Beast Core Pill, heavily imbued with demonic and beastly Qi, precisely what Qin Sang desired.</p><p>The Demonic Beast Core Pill entered his body, transforming into an extremely violent medicinal power that rampaged towards his dantian. Unfortunately, the spiritual energy in Qin Sang's body had already transformed into True Essence, incredibly dense. The medicinal power of the Demonic Beast Core Pill couldn't shake it, only creating minor ripples.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on his Purple Mansion. A faint, almost imperceptible, ferocious aura, extremely malevolent, lunged towards his Nascent Soul the moment the Demonic Beast Core Pill entered his body. Even with his strength, he couldn't stop it.</p><p>No wonder so many Canglang Sea cultivators suffered from demonic and beastly Qi.</p><p>As expected, just before touching his Nascent Soul, the demonic and beastly Qi was immediately repelled by the Buddha's light, lingering within his Purple Mansion, before reluctantly retreating and accumulating in his physical body.</p><p>Perhaps mixed with the resentment of the beasts before their deaths, the demonic and beastly Qi was incredibly stubborn, filled with malice and ferocity.</p><p>Qin Sang experimented and found that as long as it didn't invade his Nascent Soul, the demonic and beastly Qi in his physical body wasn't difficult to remove and wouldn't cause significant harm.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang also possessed a faint demonic aura, which could be used to mislead his opponents.</p><p>…</p><p>The Qiongyu Trading Company's shop was also ordinary. Qin Sang sat idly in the main hall for a while before a female cultivator, similar to him in cultivation level, also at early Core Formation, hurriedly entered.</p><p>Although this woman had high cultivation, she wasn't like other female cultivators who loved beauty. Her appearance and attire were ordinary, but her every movement exuded a unique aura belonging to high-level cultivators, making her impossible to ignore.</p><p>“I've kept fellow Daoist waiting. I am Ran Luo. May I ask for your esteemed name?”</p><p>Facing a cultivator of equal standing and holding a high position within the trading company, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't be negligent. He stood up and cupped his hands, saying, “This poor Daoist is Qingfeng. I apologize for disturbing Fellow Daoist Ran.”</p><p>Ran Luo smiled faintly, secretly sizing up Qin Sang. She didn't ask him to remove his cloak and said calmly, “It’s just a small matter that happened on the ship. With Daoist Qingfeng gracing us with your presence, I couldn't be more pleased. This place is crowded and prying eyes are many.  Why don't we go to the quiet room upstairs to talk in detail?”</p><p>“I wouldn't dare refuse!”</p><p>Ran Luo gave some instructions and led Qin Sang upstairs.</p><p>“Is Fellow Daoist Ran the chief steward of your esteemed trading company?” Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>Ran Luo shook her head, “I am unworthy of such a position. How could I presume to occupy the position of chief steward? The chief steward assigned to Pingbo Harbor this time is Elder Zou. Elder Zou is currently away, visiting the Earth God Sect. I can make decisions on some matters within the trading company. If Daoist Qingfeng insists on seeing Elder Zou, you’ll likely have to wait for half a month.”</p>
