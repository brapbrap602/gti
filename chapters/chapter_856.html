<h1>Chapter 848: The Five Yin Mystic Physique</h1><p>Qin Sang discreetly took out the talisman he had received from the young man. Channeling demonic qi, he tried to activate it, but it remained inert. It seemed he still hadn't figured out the correct method.</p><p>“Xiang Yi and Immortal Yue both hold high positions within the Merchant Alliance. Xiang Yi is even a close confidant of the Alliance Leader. Could the leader of the East End Alliance be a powerful demonic cultivator? However, rumors say that even current demonic cultivators can't withstand the erosion of ancient demonic qi. Just who is Immortal Yue's acquaintance?”</p><p>Qin Sang put away the talisman, pondering these questions.</p><p>When he tried to recall the East End Alliance Leader, he was surprised to find the image quite blurry and mysterious. There seemed to be many rumors, but all were vague and elusive.</p><p>The leaders of the other two major merchant alliances were similar; even their true cultivation levels were unknown.</p><p>In contrast, the Demon Lord, the Righteous Path's leader, and the Heavenly Dao Sect's leader, Lingzhuzi, were not so mysterious. They were all confirmed to be late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>“Truth and falsehood intertwined, each within the other, with the Witch Clan and the Demon Clan watching from the sidelines... this cultivation world is truly chaotic.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, deciding not to delve any deeper into these matters, lest he attract trouble.</p><p>Meanwhile, Immortal Yue silently infiltrated the valley, descending along the cliff face.</p><p>As she descended, she noticed the mist below growing darker and the demonic qi becoming denser.</p><p>Suddenly, Immortal Yue's expression turned serious. With a flick of her wrist, she extended her fingers, and several transparent threads shot out, vanishing into the thick mist.</p><p>Not far below Immortal Yue, perched on a protruding rock, was a vulture the size of a human. It appeared to be sleeping, but was actually quite alert, standing guard.</p><p>This location was inevitably exposed to the corrosive demonic qi.</p><p>The black-feathered vulture tucked its head under its wings, standing on one leg. Its feathers shimmered with a faint light, protecting it from the demonic qi.</p><p>The transparent threads descended from above, unnoticed by the vigilant vulture.</p><p>Only when the threads were upon it did the vulture suddenly react. It spread its wings and craned its neck to screech, but no sound came out. Its eyes were filled with panic.</p><p>In an instant, the vulture was entangled by the threads, completely immobilized.</p><p>Immortal Yue appeared on the rock, frowning at the vulture.</p><p>"The phenomenon has indeed alerted these creatures. This vulture has peak Spirit Severing Stage strength and was left here to guard. The other demonic beasts must have gone to inform the greater demon."</p><p>Immortal Yue looked upwards, a hint of worry in her eyes. "Judging by the situation, the demonic qi leak must have started only a few days ago. There's still time..."</p><p>After a moment of thought, Immortal Yue clenched her hand. The threads ignited, incinerating the vulture instantly. She continued her descent.</p><p>The valley was very deep.</p><p>The demonic qi rising from below became increasingly intense, forcing even Immortal Yue to activate a protective treasure to resist its corrosive effects.</p><p>Apart from the vulture, there were no other demonic beasts in the valley.</p><p>Immortal Yue descended without further incident, finally reaching solid ground in the pitch darkness.</p><p>“Fortunately, the amount of demonic qi accumulated here isn't excessive, otherwise, even with my cultivation, I wouldn't dare to force my way in! Success or failure depends on this, don't disappoint me!”</p><p>A fervent glint flashed in Immortal Yue's eyes. After searching for a while, she found an inconspicuous opening.</p><p>Pure demonic qi continuously poured out of the opening, leaving the surrounding area devastated. The protective formations had been completely destroyed by the outburst of demonic qi.</p><p>Confirming the absence of any greater demon, Immortal Yue eagerly entered the opening.</p><p>The tunnel within was winding and sloped downwards. Soon, Immortal Yue arrived in an underground chamber.  Her foot suddenly crunched on something.  Picking it up, she saw it was a piece of shattered jade.</p><p>Seeing the jade shard, Immortal Yue's expression changed drastically.  She hurried into the chamber, finding more and more jade fragments, covering almost the entire floor.</p><p>"Could they all be broken?"</p><p>Immortal Yue's throat tightened.  These were the jade coffins she had left behind, now reduced to shards!</p><p>"Open!"</p><p>Immortal Yue shouted, firing threads in all directions.  The threads ignited, momentarily pushing back the surrounding demonic qi, revealing the scene within the chamber.</p><p>In the center of the chamber was a complex formation. At its core lay a jade coffin, completely intact.</p><p>Inside the coffin lay a young woman!</p><p>The young woman was beautiful and innocent-looking. Lying in the coffin with her eyes closed, she resembled a sleeping beauty.</p><p>She was unclothed, her figure shapely. Her skin was unusually pale, almost bloodless.</p><p>Seeing the girl in the coffin, Immortal Yue's eyes filled with intense joy. She flashed to the coffin's side, bending down to gaze at the girl with a look of obsession.</p><p>She reached out her bark-like hands, caressing the coffin as if stroking the girl's cheek, with extreme gentleness and care.</p><p>Seeing the girl's nostrils twitch slightly, Immortal Yue laughed silently.</p><p>Quickly regaining her composure, she glanced warily at the cave entrance, then bit her fingertip, drawing mysterious runes on the coffin with her blood.</p><p>The blood runes covered the coffin, glowing crimson.</p><p>In the next moment, all the blood runes vanished into the coffin.</p><p>Immortal Yue lifted the lid with force, and the coffin opened. The girl's eyelids fluttered, slowly opening to reveal a confused expression as she sat up.</p><p>"You're awake?"</p><p>Immortal Yue's voice was like a spell.  The girl shuddered, a look of fear on her face, as if terrified of Immortal Yue.</p><p>“Do you remember your name? Who am I?”</p><p>Immortal Yue stared into the girl's eyes, her voice low and hypnotic.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>The girl opened her mouth, then suddenly clutched her head in pain, her body trembling violently.</p><p>Immortal Yue watched her coldly, neither speaking nor intervening.</p><p>“My name is Sunu! You are Master.”</p><p>The girl’s trembling stopped abruptly, her face blank as she stared at Immortal Yue.</p><p>The corners of Immortal Yue’s lips curled upwards.  In a beguiling tone, she said, “That’s right! Your name is Sunu, and you are my disciple! You are the only Sunu! Do you remember your abilities? Show me!”</p><p>Sunu looked around blankly.</p><p>Immortal Yue released a thread, allowing a wisp of demonic qi to approach.  Instinctively, the girl raised her hand and grasped the demonic qi, subconsciously circulating her cultivation technique. Then, an astonishing scene unfolded.</p><p>The demonic qi was absorbed directly into the girl's body. She screamed, curling up on the ground in pain. But then, the demonic qi was devoured by five strange meridians within her body.</p><p>Although the absorption wasn't fast, the demonic qi gradually became docile.</p><p>The girl recovered, her eyes vacant.</p><p>Immortal Yue could no longer contain her smile. Her wrinkles crinkled together as she burst into laughter: "Haha... the Five Yin Mystic Physique! It truly is the Five Yin Mystic Physique! That secret method actually worked! Using ancient demonic qi, one can truly cultivate the Acquired Five Yin Mystic Physique! The ancients did not deceive me!"</p>
