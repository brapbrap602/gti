<h1>Chapter 1719 Breakthrough</h1><p>Back then, Qin Sang and the Holy King Qinghu made a pact at the Ganlu Zen Monastery.</p><p>The pact's terms were limited to the period before Qin Sang reached Nascent Soul.  Before Qin Sang's breakthrough, Holy King Qinghu would not bully the weak. However, upon Qin Sang reaching Nascent Soul, they would be considered fellow cultivators of the same realm, and the pact would be dissolved.</p><p>Conversely, with Qin Sang's breakthrough, the restrictions on him naturally vanished as well.  Thus, Qin Sang now had no qualms about attacking the several Great Saint level demons.</p><p>In truth, even if Qin Sang hadn't broken through, there were loopholes to exploit. Holy King Qinghu seemed to have mentioned the pact casually, without giving it much thought.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu had proclaimed to have only enemies, no kin or friends.  The claim that even if Qin Sang slaughtered the entire Eastern Sea demon race, she wouldn't blink an eye, wasn't an empty boast.</p><p>Qin Sang captured the Great Saint Zishen and, after interrogation, learned that Holy King Qinghu hadn't informed them about the Demonic Sound of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>These Great Saint level demons pledged allegiance to the Holy King's Palace, borrowing the Holy King's might to act with impunity and seize benefits. Holy King Qinghu merely regarded them as pawns, disposable at will.</p><p>The sword formation sealed the heavens.</p><p>In an instant, the four Demon Kings were ensnared.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they were lost, unsure of what realm they had fallen into.</p><p>Great Saint Baixiao had personally witnessed the battle at the Wuxiang Immortal Sect and seen the Five Elements Divine Prohibition. However, at that time, the Five Elements Divine Prohibition was on the verge of collapse, the sword formation barely functioning.  Compared to the formation Qin Sang now wielded, it was like night and day.</p><p>He was both shocked and terrified.  Looking around, he saw sword stars arrayed in the starry sky. A sense of insignificance arose spontaneously, his courage faltering before the battle even began.</p><p>His two subordinates were beside him, but the Black Lion was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>This was another profound aspect of the Seven Stellar Mansions Sword Formation: it could separate enemies into different Stellar Mansions and defeat them individually.  The Black Lion and Great Saint Baixiao's faction weren't united in heart or purpose.  Faced with imminent peril, each fled for themselves, unknowingly separated by the sword formation.</p><p>The Black Lion fell into the Kui Mansion.</p><p>The three demons were shifted to the Shen Mansion. Even if the formation's master didn't intentionally obstruct them, rejoining wouldn't be easy.</p><p>"Don't panic!  This person controls the formation alone. There must be a flaw. Find the main star and we can break the formation…"</p><p>Great Saint Baixiao seemed quite knowledgeable about the Seven Stellar Mansions Sword Formation, hitting the nail on the head.</p><p>He hadn't actually obtained the Seven Stellar Mansions Sword Formation secret manual.</p><p>After the Demon Subduing War, witnessing the anomalies at Emperor Bestowal Mountain, Holy King Qinghu and Holy Venerable Huiguang had discussed the Five Elements Divine Prohibition. He happened to overhear a few sentences.</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Prohibition was the pinnacle creation of the five branches of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. The Seven Stellar Mansions Sword Formation, as the top sword formation of the Metal Phase branch, typically required multiple sword cultivators working together to achieve such grandeur.</p><p>Controlling the formation alone made it difficult to cover everything.</p><p>Great Saint Baixiao's eyes turned deathly white as he secretly employed a technique to seek flaws in the sword formation.  Unexpectedly, after a full scan, he found all the stars present and accounted for, moving smoothly.  None of the Seven Stellar Mansions' starlight was dim.</p><p>Unable to find a flaw for the moment, Great Saint Baixiao's expression darkened. He growled, "Protect me!"</p><p>...</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to deal with the three demons. He appeared in the Kui Mansion.</p><p>The Black Lion, alone in the Kui Mansion, unlike Great Saint Baixiao, had little understanding of the Seven Stellar Mansions Sword Formation. Looking at the sword stars, seemingly near and far, he was momentarily at a loss.</p><p>This demon, however, was ferocious. A black light flashed across his body, his head transforming into a massive black lion's head.  He opened his maw, revealing sharp fangs, and roared towards the heavens.</p><p>A black orb was ejected from his mouth. This wasn't his demon core, but a rare treasure acquired long ago.</p><p>The orb spun rapidly, its inner scene chaotic, displaying an illusion of mountains of corpses and seas of blood.</p><p>'Poof!'</p><p>Two streams of black qi erupted from the Black Lion Great Saint's nostrils and flashed into the orb. The illusion within the orb was swallowed by the black qi.  The orb trembled, and the black qi within condensed into a black blade.</p><p>The black blade was small and delicate, but an extremely sharp blade aura emanated from the orb.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The inside of the orb suddenly emptied, becoming crystal clear.</p><p>Simultaneously, the black blade materialized in the starry sky, its tip slightly upturned, leaving behind a shocking blade aura. Wherever it passed, the starlight dimmed, accompanied by lion roars, slashing towards the sword star!</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>Forced by the black blade, the sword star seemed about to be cleaved in two.</p><p>At this moment, the starlight in the void brightened, projecting onto the Kui Mansion.  Suddenly, meteors streaked across, leaving behind trails of stardust. From the Black Lion Great Saint's perspective, it seemed as if the heavens were spinning, making him dizzy.</p><p>These weren't meteors but streaks of sword energy.</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The sword energies arrived simultaneously.</p><p>The sword star targeted by the black blade instantly became bright as the sun.</p><p>The Black Lion's eyes widened, watching in a daze as the black blade, after slashing into the starlight, melted away like snow at a visible speed, vanishing without a trace.</p><p>Even as the starlight gradually faded, the astonishment in the Black Lion's eyes lingered. That strike had been neutralized just like that, without a ripple.</p><p>When the sword star returned to normal, a Daoist appeared above it.</p><p>Qin Sang's true form materialized, standing with his hands behind his back atop the sword star. Looking down at the Black Lion Great Saint, he gave him a once-over and nodded with satisfaction. He said indifferently, "This poor Daoist just happens to be in need of a mount…"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the Black Lion Great Saint's eyes darted around, and he dropped to his knees.</p><p>"I am willing to follow True Monarch!"</p><p>As he spoke, the Black Lion Great Saint rolled on the spot, his true form transforming into a majestic black lion. He lowered his head, prostrating himself at Qin Sang's feet.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and, without hesitation, formed a hand seal and struck it towards the Black Lion Great Saint's forehead.</p><p>A flicker of resentment flashed in the Black Lion Great Saint's eyes, but he dared not resist.  He obediently allowed Qin Sang to place the restriction.  His body trembled slightly, and he prostrated himself even lower.</p><p>...</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Great Saint Baixiao also revealed his demon form.</p><p>A ghastly white shadow, humanoid and ferocious, clawed at the air within the starry sky, surrounded by swirling white smoke.  Countless wraiths and demons materialized within the smoke, their forms contorted, eerie and sinister.</p><p>He hadn't uttered a single plea for mercy from beginning to end.</p><p>Great Saint Baixiao knew that the deadly feud they'd forged had no room for reconciliation.</p><p>This person was the expert behind that Longjing fellow. No wonder the Holy King's Palace fell so quickly.</p><p>A newly ascended Nascent Soul daring to provoke the Holy King's Palace meant this person wasn't even afraid of Holy King Qinghu.  The only way out Great Saint Baixiao could think of was to escape.</p><p>Break out of the sword formation, regroup his forces, and rely on the battle formation for a sliver of hope.</p><p>A fierce glint appeared in the white shadow's eyes. He grabbed dozens of wraiths and demons from the smoke and stuffed them into his mouth, devouring them without a second thought.</p><p>Amidst the wails and howls of ghosts, the wraiths and demons within the white smoke involuntarily plunged into the white shadow's body. With each wraith or demon consumed, the white shadow solidified, the fierceness in its eyes intensifying.</p><p>The two Demon Kings by his side exchanged glances, gritted their teeth, and a white qi ascended from each of their crowns. Just as they were about to merge it into the white shadow, they suddenly sensed something amiss.</p><p>The stars in the sky twinkled, and large stars abruptly shot towards them.</p><p>The sword stars moved like a collapsing sky. An astonishing pressure bore down on them, originating from sharp sword intent. Before the sword light even arrived, they felt as if they had been struck by hundreds, thousands of swords.</p><p>The three demons froze in unison.</p><p>The white shadow let out a sinister laugh, a bone blade materializing in its hand.  It was about to pounce when it saw a black shadow burst out from the sword light, accompanied by a lion's roar. A fierce gust of wind rushed towards it.</p><p>"This traitor switched sides!"</p><p>Great Saint Baixiao was enraged. Seeing the Black Lion show him no mercy, striking with a killing blow, hatred surged in his heart. The bone blade sliced a white line, slashing towards the Black Lion's forehead.</p><p>As soon as they clashed, two screams came from behind him.</p><p>His two capable subordinates weren't a match for the sword formation, both sliced in half, perishing on the spot.</p><p>Atop a sword star.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, eyes slightly closed, his expression alternating between contemplation and sudden understanding, as if deducing something.</p><p>He had already trapped the three demons with the Seven Stellar Mansions Sword Formation and naturally didn't need help.  However, the Black Lion, eager to prove himself, volunteered, so he let him go.</p><p>He allowed the Black Lion and Baixiao to fight it out.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on comprehending the sword formation.</p><p>Unlike cultivation techniques, divine abilities, and the Seven Souls Killing Formation, when first trying a new sword formation, a sense of awkwardness was inevitable.</p><p>If his opponents weren't Great Saint level demons but fellow cultivators of the same realm, they could discern flaws after a period of entanglement. Of course, as Qin Sang's understanding of the sword formation deepened, it would gradually become more fluid.  There was no rushing it.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't currently focused on perfecting the sword formation but on a new insight.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had only considered the Seven Stellar Mansions Sword Formation as an ordinary Nascent Soul realm technique, advantageous for trapping enemies and group battles, and as a transition before mastering the Cloud Roaming Sword.</p><p>Only now, upon using it, did he realize that this sword formation wasn't so simple. Its power wasn't limited to this. There were other variations he hadn't grasped.</p><p>The secret manual didn't explicitly mention them.  Presumably, one could comprehend them after cultivating the sword formation to a certain level.  Qin Sang had managed to control the formation alone as soon as he used it, so he discovered this early.</p><p>Qin Sang grasped that spark of inspiration, pondered for a long time, and finally shook his head.</p><p>It was the same principle: one couldn't be too ambitious. Master the sword formation first, then consider other things.</p><p>However, this showed that the Seven Stellar Mansions Sword Formation had great potential. Qin Sang couldn't help but feel anticipation. It seemed he would have to devote more effort to the sword path in the future.</p><p>He raised his head and looked at the battlefield.  Seeing that the battle between the Black Lion and Baixiao hadn't been decided yet, unwilling to waste time, he waved his hand, and the sword stars descended together.</p><p>…</p><p>The demon soldiers of White Nether Mountain were being led by several Demon Kings back to their lair, unaware of the events unfolding ahead.</p><p>A streak of light pursued them closely.</p><p>Within the light was a demon bird, its speed like lightning.  Judging by its velocity, even some transformed Demon Kings couldn't match it.</p><p>The demon soldiers, seeing the approaching demon, made way.</p><p>The demon bird flew to the center of the army, stopping before a jeweled palanquin guarded by a throng of demons.  It preened its feathers and respectfully said, "Reporting to the Great Kings, the rebel army did not pursue…"</p><p>After the report, there was no response from within the palanquin.</p><p>The demon bird's eyes were filled with suspicion.  It called out a few more times, then, emboldened, it opened the palanquin and gasped.</p><p>It was empty!</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang, riding the Black Lion, trod the waves on the sea's surface.</p><p>The Demon Kings of the White Nether Mountain lineage had almost all been slaughtered by him.</p><p>These Demon Kings had once relied on Holy King Qinghu to act tyrannically in the Eastern Sea, wantonly plundering resources, yet because of Holy King Qinghu provoking powerful enemies, their thousand years of cultivation were lost in a single day.</p><p>Truly, fortune and misfortune are intertwined; the world is unpredictable.</p><p>"Master, we're approaching the Holy King's Palace."</p><p>The Black Lion walked on the sea's surface as if it were solid ground, proactively reporting, "Not to mention the other sacred grounds, Master must not forget the Li Water Bright Sand of Li Hanchuan. This humble one observes Master's overflowing vitality and refined physique. That Li Water Bright Sand, after refinement, can strengthen the physical body, not only effective for the demon race."</p><p>The Holy King's Palace fell too quickly; the Li Water Bright Sand hadn't yet matured. The Black Lion was offering a gift taken from another.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled something and waved his hand, releasing a stream of true essence.  Several images materialized before the Black Lion. "Have you ever seen these treasures?"</p><p>The Black Lion shook its head repeatedly until it saw a strange object, neither quite tree nor not-tree.  "Eh? I seem to have seen this treasure among the Four-Winged Divine Horse clan. However, it wasn't called Hundred-Insect Grass but White Water Coral."</p><p>Hundred-Insect Grass was a main ingredient for the Green Frost Pill.  The Witch race and the demon race had different heritages; different names were normal.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked the Black Lion a few more questions, which the Black Lion answered without reservation.</p><p>Gazing at the azure sea, Qin Sang pondered the aftermath of the demon race's internal conflict.  Before long, they arrived at the Holy King's Palace.  Great Saint Longjing only had his demon soldiers surround the Holy King's Palace, waiting for Qin Sang's arrival before entering together.</p><p>The Holy King's Palace wasn't particularly extravagant.</p><p>As the residence of the demon race's Holy King, it even appeared somewhat simple.</p><p>Walking within the Holy King's Palace, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable coldness. Led by the Black Lion, he headed towards Holy King Qinghu's sleeping quarters, surprised to find it wasn't a palace but an inconspicuous low hill, devoid of exotic flowers or rare herbs.</p><p>The Black Lion said, "Back then, the Holy King ordered us to infiltrate the land and find this mountain. This humble one personally led the troops to move this mountain here and then transplanted the vegetation according to the Holy King's instructions…"</p><p>Holy King Qinghu's cave dwelling was behind the mountain, a cave within a cold, gloomy ravine.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling, Qin Sang saw some crude stone tables and stools, as well as a thin quilt.  He could imagine a fox wrapped in the thin quilt, curled up here in solitude.</p><p>Recalling Holy King Qinghu's account of her origins, Qin Sang thought, "This is her cave dwelling from back on land.  To think that ruthless fox had this side to her…"</p><p>Having plundered Holy King Qinghu's lair, Qin Sang felt little joy.</p><p>There were gains, of course, and they were plentiful.</p><p>The belongings and remains of those Great Saint level demons were all invaluable treasures.</p><p>But one's perspective always changed with their realm.  Before reaching Nascent Soul, obtaining these would have made Qin Sang ecstatic.  Now, few treasures in this world could catch his eye.</p><p>The same went for the Holy King's Palace. The most valuable treasures had already been taken by Holy King Qinghu, leaving behind mere scraps.</p><p>He, as the mastermind behind the scenes, had instigated the demon race's internal conflict, hoping to force Holy King Qinghu to appear.  Now it seemed this plan had failed.</p><p>"Has she truly left?"</p><p>Qin Sang walked out of the cave, gazing at the clear sky, silent for a long time.</p><p>Great Saint Longjing came to report at this time. He was the biggest winner of this war, his face brimming with joy. Just as he was about to speak, Qin Sang said, "This poor Daoist will borrow the Eastern Sea's Eye of the Sea for cultivation.  The other treasures are of no use to me. I expect you to quickly gather the Li Water Bright Sand, the White Water Coral… Consider them this poor Daoist's reward."</p><p>Qin Sang listed several treasures, all beneficial to his cultivation, then flew towards the center of the Holy King's Palace without looking back. There lay the entrance to the Eastern Sea's Eye of the Sea.</p><p>Great Saint Longjing's expression shifted uncertainly, feeling some heartache, but he could only agree.</p><p>…</p><p>'Splash…'</p><p>The Eastern Sea's Eye of the Sea was located in the deep sea, a scene of deep blue.</p><p>Qin Sang occupied this sacred ground, and no one dared to disturb him.</p><p>Great Saint Longjing initially worried that Qin Sang would reside here permanently.  Later, seeing that Qin Sang wasn't interested in the treasures produced by the Eye of the Sea, he breathed a sigh of relief and used various methods to gather the items Qin Sang had requested from the various clans.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stay here for long.</p><p>After his tribulation, his physical body had greatly improved.  During this period, he devoted himself to cultivating the Heavenly Demon Body Refining technique and, utilizing spirit pills, wondrous medicines, and the unique terrain of the Eastern Sea's Eye of the Sea, made rapid progress, soon successfully breaking through to the mid-stage of the fourth level.</p><p>He didn't push on to continue cultivating and break through further, but instead paused, flying out of the Eastern Sea, departing without notice.</p><p>The Eastern Sea Islands.</p><p>Human cultivators were all oblivious as a Daoist, riding a black lion, came from the Eastern Sea.</p><p>Soon, land was in sight.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
