<h1>    like these, when they appear, surely end up in the hands of Nascent Soul ancestors, right?” Qin Sang remarked.</p></h1><p><p>Wherever the Ten Divine Trees appear, danger is sure to lurk. Those with weaker cultivation simply can’t reach</p><p>    them.</p><p>Even if one were to luckily obtain such a treasure with insufficient strength, possessing it would be</p><p>    more trouble than it’s worth, possibly inviting fatal disaster.</p><p>“Not necessarily!”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer shook</p><p>    his head. “Of the three instances I know of, one involved a type of spiritual bamboo, one of the Ten Divine Trees</p><p>    known as the Pure Fortune Bamboo. Nascent Soul cultivators and transformed demons competed for it, but legend says</p><p>    it escaped on its own and remains undiscovered to this day. No one has ever heard of any magical tools crafted from</p><p>    Pure Fortune Bamboo.”</p><p>“It escaped while surrounded by Nascent Soul cultivators and transformed demons?” Qin</p><p>    Sang was astonished. “Could the Pure Fortune Bamboo have developed sentience and become a transformed demon</p><p>    itself?”</p><p>“Hard to say. It might have been hidden by someone. Transformation is extremely difficult for demons,</p><p>    especially for beings of the Ten Divine Trees’ caliber. Even developing sentience invites heavenly jealousy, so the</p><p>    tribulation of transformation must be incredibly arduous. After all, the path of immortality is never easy…”</p><p></p><p>    Cloud Wanderer seemed to be recalling his own cultivation journey, sighing deeply. Qin Sang, reflecting on his own</p><p>    experiences, felt a pang of empathy.</p><p>“What about the second instance?” Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>“The second</p><p>    involved the Unending Blood Mulberry, another of the Ten Divine Trees, known as the ultimate tree of defilement.</p><p>    Magical tools crafted from it can unleash a divine ability called the Blood Defilement Light, which can contaminate</p><p>    other people’s magical instruments and tools. Inferior instruments might be completely destroyed, while even magical</p><p>    tools will suffer a significant loss of spirit and require extensive nurturing to recover.</p><p>It's said that the</p><p>    Unending Blood Mulberry was shattered during a struggle between several Nascent Soul demon cultivators, scattering</p><p>    its fragments deep within the Boundless Valley. Cultivators still venture into the valley, hoping to find a piece.</p><p>    After all, a divine ability like the Blood Defilement Light can instantly decide a battle.</p><p>However, the</p><p>    Boundless Valley isn’t easy to navigate. As they say, men die for wealth, birds die for food. Many lose their lives</p><p>    in the search.”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer spoke with a hint of sarcasm.</p><p>“Boundless Valley?”</p><p>Qin Sang</p><p>    carefully searched his memory but couldn’t recall hearing the name. It didn’t seem to be among the famous secret</p><p>    realms of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer smiled. “The Boundless Valley isn't in the Ancient</p><p>    Immortal Battlefield, but rather a forbidden zone deep within the Severed Sky Mountains. Mostly demon cultivators</p><p>    enter, and countless have died there. To say corpses litter the ground wouldn’t be an exaggeration.”</p><p>Qin Sang</p><p>    nodded silently. So it was in the Severed Sky Mountains.</p><p>The Severed Sky Mountains were vast and boundless,</p><p>    containing many forbidden zones and perilous locations within their wilderness.</p><p>“The third instance is even</p><p>    more interesting.</p><p>It remains unclear which of the Ten Divine Trees appeared, but shortly after the event, the</p><p>    Pure Yang Sect suddenly launched a massive attack on the Blood Nether Sect, single-handedly annihilating the</p><p>    then-powerful demon sect and slaying its leader on the spot. It shocked the entire Little Cold Realm!</p><p>Later,</p><p>    rumors spread that a low-level disciple of the Blood Nether Sect had obtained the Divine Tree.</p><p>Whether the two</p><p>    events are connected remains a mystery, with various speculations circulating.</p><p>However, information seemingly</p><p>    released by the Pure Yang Sect later claimed that the Blood Nether Sect disciple had already fled the Little Cold</p><p>    Realm with the Divine Tree.</p><p>The truth of the matter is known only to the Pure Yang Sect.”</p><p>Cloud</p><p>    Wanderer's tone was tinged with amusement.</p><p>So that was the reason for the Pure Yang Sect’s destruction of the</p><p>    Blood Nether Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to himself. The Pure Yang Sect was undoubtedly the strongest of the Eight</p><p>    Righteous Sects, and their sect leader's cultivation was unmatched in the Little Cold Realm. Likely no one would</p><p>    dare question them directly.</p><p>“Senior, I’ve recovered enough. Let me take the helm.”</p><p>Qin Sang rose and</p><p>    offered to relieve Cloud Wanderer.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer, also greatly depleted, readily agreed. He explained the</p><p>    method of controlling the Spiritual Bamboo Flying Boat to Qin Sang, who, with his assistance, could still navigate</p><p>    the vessel.</p><p>The boat sped through the earth, and even the magnificent and grand spectacle of flowing magma had</p><p>    become tiresome.</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly glanced at Cloud Wanderer and sighed inwardly, “I hope the trial space</p><p>    isn't too far from the stone tablet and that nothing else goes wrong.”</p><p>The two took turns at the helm,</p><p>    steadily guiding the Spiritual Bamboo Flying Boat, keeping the Fire Spirit Beasts at bay, and managing to avoid any</p><p>    major dangers.</p><p>Qin Sang once again felt his spiritual power depleting and handed control back to Cloud</p><p>    Wanderer. Cloud Wanderer gave Qin Sang a puzzled look, as if about to say something, but hesitated.</p><p>“Brother</p><p>    Qin… Forgive my bluntness, but is there some hidden damage to your Dantian Qi Sea?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled,</p><p>    then understanding dawned. Although he had always been careful to conceal the damage to his foundation, the</p><p>    relentless pursuit by the Fire Spirit Beast and the exertion required to control the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat had</p><p>    made complete concealment impossible.</p><p>It was natural for Yun Youzi, skilled in both alchemy and medicine, to</p><p>    notice some clues.</p><p>With the Ebony Sword and the Ten Yama Banners at his disposal, Qin Sang was completely</p><p>    unafraid of cultivators of the same realm.</p><p>Moreover, Yun Youzi could only sense that his Qi Sea was damaged,</p><p>    but the extent of the damage and its severity were impossible to discern with the naked eye.</p><p>Because of this,</p><p>    Qin Sang wasn't afraid of Yun Youzi seeing through him.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had indeed intended to consult</p><p>    someone skilled in both alchemy and medicine about restoring his foundation, and Yun Youzi had been on his list of</p><p>    potential candidates.</p><p>Since he'd been found out, Qin Sang frankly admitted, “Senior has a keen eye. In order</p><p>    to break through to Foundation Establishment, this junior used a secret technique, which caused some damage to my Qi</p><p>    Sea. Although it hasn't greatly affected my cultivation, I've tried many methods but haven't been able to heal it.</p><p>    It's like a thorn that I can't remove, truly frustrating.”</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, Yun Youzi suddenly</p><p>    laughed, much to Qin Sang’s surprise.</p><p>“Brother Qin, we truly are fated. Did you know that the hidden ailment I</p><p>    suffered in breaking through to Foundation Establishment affects my Nascent Soul? And like yours, it has become a</p><p>    chronic illness. I've traveled far and wide seeking spiritual herbs to restore my Nascent Soul, but unfortunately, I</p><p>    haven't seen any improvement. The spiritual herb I encountered underground just now was the Fire-Averse Azure Lotus.</p><p>    I thought… but the lotus seeds were already gone…”</p><p>Yun Youzi’s smile faded, his brow furrowed deeply, wrinkles</p><p>    etched on his face. His eyes held a deep weariness and disappointment as he sighed heavily.</p><p>“If I can’t cure</p><p>    this chronic illness, not only will reaching Golden Core be impossible in this lifetime, but even breaking through</p><p>    to mid-Foundation Establishment is uncertain…”</p><p>The Fire-Averse Azure Lotus is a rare spiritual herb. The lotus</p><p>    produces twelve lotus seeds, which eventually fuse into one, maximizing its medicinal potency.</p><p>The lotus seeds</p><p>    have the effect of nourishing the soul and strengthening the Nascent Soul, making them a truly rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>    To stumble upon a Fire-Averse Azure Lotus only to find it missing its most crucial component…</p><p>It’s a testament</p><p>    to Yun Youzi’s resilience that he could face such a swing from elation to despair with such composure, only</p><p>    revealing his disappointment when speaking of it.</p></p>
