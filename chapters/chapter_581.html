Chapter 574: The Inner Sanctum


Approaching the altar, its immense size became apparent.  A thick, lingering aura of bloodshed, crimson and viscous like actual blood, filled the air, striking fear into the hearts of even the bravest.  


Even without the ancient restrictions, few would dare venture into that miasma of death.


After the Immortal Tomb, they faced several more perilous locations, but none were as terrifying as the Tomb's ghost king.


The Immortal Tomb was undoubtedly the most dangerous obstacle. Beyond it, the remaining dangers posed little threat to Golden Core cultivators, provided they exercised caution.


They encountered unique ancient formations that forced them to separate and proceed individually.


Fortunately, Dongyang Bo had prepared protective talismans and artifacts, ensuring Qin Sang and the others made it through unscathed.


Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan had a single objective: the Inner Sanctum.


Nothing else held their interest; they ignored any unusual lights or hidden realms encountered along the way, racing towards their destination.


Qin Sang was naturally overjoyed at their speed. The faster Dongyang Bo traveled, the fewer opponents they would encounter when harvesting the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.  Those Golden Core cultivators would undoubtedly be slower.


The downside was that Yunyouzi would likely fall behind.  He hoped the jade bracelet would last long enough for Yunyouzi to catch up.


"That jade disc ahead marks the entrance to the Inner Sanctum. Once inside, remain where you are and do not wander, especially not into any sealed ancient halls.  Chen Yan and I will find you."


Dongyang Bo pointed ahead, giving them final instructions.


Before them lay a semicircular mountain, its center cradling a massive chasm hundreds of meters in diameter.


The pit exhaled a chilling, demonic aura, bottomless and radiating an icy coldness that seemed to connect to the underworld.


Legend held that a Yuan Ying expert once risked their life by leaping into the chasm, but even before the Ziwei Palace sealed, its depths remained unexplored.


On the far side of the chasm, a sheer cliff face was visible. Embedded in it, like a moon in the night sky, was an enormous八卦 jade disc, incredibly striking.


The pure jade disc, set against the demonic chasm, seemed oddly out of place.


Dongyang Bo was pointing to this disc.


"The ancient restrictions within the disc were once extremely powerful, even posing a threat to Yuan Ying cultivators.  Fortunately, they've been damaged, their power greatly diminished. What remains will only mildly affect your state of mind.  Each of you has a calming pendant that will allow you to pass without issue. Those who believe themselves strong-willed can treat it as a trial of the mind – though it has less effect on Golden Core cultivators now, you might still gain benefits."


Qin Sang accepted the calming pendant, feeling a wave of coolness, a subtle calming effect, and stowed it away calmly.  He didn't need such things with his jade Buddha.


"No time to waste. Let's go!"


With that, Dongyang Bo and the others leaped into the air, flying straight towards the jade disc, soaring over the chasm.


The instant they touched the jade disc's soft light, Qin Sang felt a sudden lightness. Looking up, he saw that the Golden Bell and the others had vanished without a trace.  


It seemed the jade disc, much like the previous formation, would forcibly separate them all.


A surreal passage appeared, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colors, as if he'd stepped into a fantastical kaleidoscope.


Qin Sang secretly activated the jade Buddha to protect his spirit, and experienced no tribulation of the mind.


Though the passage seemed illusory, it had a solid feel underfoot.  Qin Sang hesitated briefly before using his fastest movement technique to dash toward the end of the passage.


He had already experienced trials of the mind within the Red Dust Gourd.


With the jade Buddha, such methods had no effect, leaving him calm and detached, unable to immerse himself and thereby achieve the intended refinement. It was a waste of time.


His past breakthroughs in mental fortitude were born of his trials and tribulations along the way.


Inside the passage, Qin Sang unleashed the Sword Qi Thunder Sound Divine Ability, transforming into a sword light and speeding through. This passage was unique, its end unseen.


Suddenly, Qin Sang sensed a barrier, which he broke through instantly.


"I'm out!"


Qin Sang immediately grabbed the prepared jade bracelet and secured it to his arm.


Instantly, the chaos vanished, replaced by bright light.  A faint scent of grass reached Qin Sang's nose, a stark contrast to the grim, bloody stench of the outer hall.

He found himself not on solid ground, but falling through empty space.  Looking down, he confirmed his position:  mid-air, above a meadow of lush green grass dotted with yellow and white wildflowers, vibrant with life.

“Please, don’t let me meet Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan! I’ve heard everyone enters the inner hall at a different place; it shouldn’t be this easy,” he prayed silently, raising his arm to examine it.

The wooden bracelet, upon his wrist, transformed into a small, intricately carved jade dragon bracelet.  The tiny yellow dragon came alive, its mouth opening to inhale the blood-red mark on Qin Sang's arm.

The silken thread pulsed, then was swallowed by the dragon, yet remained intact, the dragon itself now bound by the thread.  However, the mark's energy was effectively blocked.

The dragon yawned, a surprisingly human-like gesture, coiled around Qin Sang's arm, then reverted to its bracelet form.

Qin Sang tested the bracelet; it felt strong and secure.  Reassured, he surveyed his surroundings.

Before him stood a verdant mountain, its slopes alive with the sounds of trickling water and towering ancient trees.  Yet, the silence was unnerving; no birdsong, not even the chirp of insects.  The vibrant life felt strangely, profoundly still.

Halfway up the mountain, he spotted a glimpse of an eaves hidden amongst the trees – an ancient temple.  A shimmering green aura above it, however, revealed a protective barrier, indicating it wasn't as safe as it appeared.

Qin Sang concealed himself behind a tree.  Shifting his gaze from the mountain to the foot of it, then to the far side of the meadow, he discovered the meadow ended abruptly!

He looked further.

A misty expanse, ethereal and cloud-like, stretched before him, a scene reminiscent of a fairyland.  Within the sea of clouds, however, he could see two floating landmasses, each separate and distinct, like islands suspended in the sky.

These landmasses varied in size. One, similar in scale to his own, possessed a complete mountain peak.  The other, much smaller, held a surprisingly large river, its waters seemingly inexhaustible, cascading down from the heavens, disappearing into the mists below.

And beyond…he sensed more fragments in the distance!
