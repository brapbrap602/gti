<h1>Chapter 683: The Blue Jiao Inner Pill</h1><p>Chapter 683: The Blue Jiao Inner Pill</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>The elder exclaimed, his face full of shock.</p><p>From the moment they saw Qin Sang make his move to the time they rushed in, barely a few dozen breaths had passed, yet Qin Sang had already easily captured the leader of the Jiao swarm, without any sign of a fierce battle.</p><p>This showed that the Blue Jiao was completely powerless, subdued without resistance.</p><p>The three exchanged glances, all astonished, their eyes filled with deep worry.</p><p>They had accepted Qin Sang's commission after careful consideration, believing that with their few trump cards, even if Qin Sang attacked them, they would still have the means to fight back.</p><p>Now they realized how naive they had been.</p><p>This cloaked Taoist’s power was extraordinary. If he truly attacked them, they would be just like the Blue Jiao – completely helpless.</p><p>“Kill the Jiao!”</p><p>The elder, a decisive man, tore his gaze away from Qin Sang, gritting his teeth and shouting.</p><p>The other two also knew it was too late to dwell on this.  Qin Sang’s actions along the way hadn’t seemed particularly cruel, offering them a small measure of reassurance.</p><p>Qin Sang disregarded the others' thoughts.</p><p>He first cleaved the demonic fog with a sword, then released two Sky-Soaring Night Rakshasas, which, along with his ebony sword, made capturing the mere Spirit Transformation peak Blue Jiao effortless.</p><p>However, he dared not be careless. After capturing the Blue Jiao leader, he immediately summoned the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, preparing to kill the Jiao and extract its soul. Otherwise, if they delayed too long, the surrounding demonic beasts would be alerted.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, pressing it against the Blue Jiao's forehead.</p><p>The Blue Jiao roared wildly, its ferocity flaring, but as the talisman glowed brighter, its light like countless silver needles piercing the Blue Jiao's body, its struggles began to weaken.</p><p>Soon, a palm-sized Jiao dragon spirit essence was extracted inch by inch from its forehead, slowly floating towards the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman.</p><p>The Jiao dragon spirit essence struggled fiercely, but before Qin Sang, all was futile.</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly cast numerous hand seals, activating the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, gradually absorbing the Jiao dragon spirit essence until the talisman stabilized completely.</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned, and the talisman flew into his palm.</p><p>Within the pure, jade-like talisman, seven Jiao souls were now imprisoned, increasing its power significantly.</p><p>Putting away the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, Qin Sang turned to look around.</p><p>After losing their leader, the Jiao were in disarray, scrambling to flee to the seabed. The elder and the other two had already killed over a dozen large Jiao in the chaos, their expressions filled with excitement.</p><p>By now, the seawater below was stained crimson with blood, a faint scent of blood spreading through the air.</p><p>The water mist was also thinning.</p><p>At that moment, the old woman’s voice came from outside: “Daoist Master, the eastern sea seems to be disturbed. A strange wind is whipping up waves, blowing towards us.”</p><p>Qin Sang commanded: “Stop killing them! Divide the Jiao corpses and leave this place!”</p><p>If they attracted a powerful demonic beast, all six of them would be in grave danger.</p><p>Moreover, according to Duoyan Island's rules, they couldn't exterminate the Blue Jiao; what they'd already done was enough.</p><p>The elder and the others understood the gravity of the situation and immediately stopped, gathering their spoils.</p><p>Qin Sang skillfully began to dissect the Jiao corpse before him, taking only the valuable parts and storing them in his Qianjun Ring.  As he cut off the Jiao's head, Qin Sang let out a soft sound of surprise.  He probed it with his true essence and extracted a blue pill resembling a demon core.</p><p>“Is this a demonic beast inner pill?”</p><p>Seeing the pill, Qin Sang recalled the Tianyan Jiao inner pill he had obtained from Kong Xin in Wuya Valley.</p><p>The two looked very similar.</p><p>However, the Tianyan Jiao inner pill contained powerful fiery energy, while this inner pill seemed to be a poison pill, slowly corroding his true essence.</p><p>After entering the Demon Sea, Qin Sang's understanding of demonic beasts had increased significantly. He knew this type of inner pill wasn't unique to the Tianyan Jiao. Hunting Spirit Transformation late-stage demonic beasts might yield similar inner pills, though the chances were extremely low.</p><p>Demonic beasts with inner pills were generally stronger than others, and whether inner pills were related to demon cores remained unclear to cultivators. However, like demon cores, inner pills could be added to煞妖丹 (Sha Yao Dan) and 血骨丹 (Xue Gu Dan), enhancing their potency, making them highly valuable.</p><p>This Blue Jiao possessed an inner pill, indicating significant strength, but unfortunately, it was unable to utilize it before being surrounded and killed by Qin Sang and his two Sky-Soaring Night Rakshasas.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade box, about to seal the inner core, when he sensed unusual activity from the fat silkworm in its container.  The silkworm's cries were as urgent as when it had encountered the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, showing intense eagerness.</p><p>Could it be that its true favorite food is the inner core of a demonic beast?</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up. He had tried countless methods, but the silkworm had ignored them all. Unexpectedly, he had found what it liked!</p><p>"No, perhaps it's because this is a poisonous core that attracts the silkworm's interest. I wonder if a normal demonic beast core will work?"  Qin Sang mused, remembering the silkworm's abilities were all poison-related.</p><p>Now wasn't the time to verify. Qin Sang put away the blue-scaled dragon's inner core, quickly finished dismembering the corpse. Seeing everyone else was done, he immediately ordered a retreat.</p><p>The six of them stealthily escaped, hearing the booming sound of surging waves behind them.</p><p>Only after a considerable distance did they dare to look back.</p><p>They discovered that the area where they had hunted the dragon was now ravaged by fierce winds, demonic energy billowing into the sky, even obscuring the moon.  Terrible shadows seemed to be rising from the depths of the sea.</p><p>If they had stayed a moment longer, they would have been trapped!</p><p>The group was secretly alarmed. They proceeded more cautiously, hurrying through the night, and escaped the area without further incident.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>"You've been active here for so long, you must have a safe base. Take me there. We'll hunt dragons again after this area calms down."</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely.  After last night's battle, the commotion afterward had left him uneasy, so he decided to proceed carefully.</p><p>The elder hesitated, but ultimately obeyed Qin Sang's order, heading south.</p><p>After several days of travel, they landed on a desolate island.</p><p>The island's rock crevices led directly underground, where a hidden spiritual vein, though small, was sufficient for a dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang gave a few instructions, chose the innermost cave, and set up protective barriers.</p><p>He took out the silkworm and the blue-scaled dragon's inner core.</p><p>Upon seeing the core, the silkworm's eyes gleamed just as they had with the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, its cries filled with intense longing.</p><p>While the inner core was valuable, if it could enhance the silkworm's abilities, Qin Sang wouldn't hesitate. He immediately unsealed the blue-scaled dragon's inner core and tossed it to the silkworm.</p><p>The silkworm chirped happily, a seven-colored glow appearing on its body as it landed on the core, then crawled over and embraced it.</p><p>Instead of eating the core like it had the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, it was absorbing the core's power using the seven-colored glow.</p><p>The silkworm hugged the core contentedly, neither pupating nor fully asleep. The inner core showed no apparent changes.</p><p>It seemed its absorption of the blue-scaled dragon's core would be a lengthy process.</p>
