<h1>Chapter 647: Well-Behaved</h1><p>Qin Sang prepared to teach it a lesson.</p><p>This creature was incredibly lazy, remembering only food and not punishment; ordinary methods were useless, and it would forget immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Demonfire Needle in one hand, and with the other, she used true energy to form a cage, trapping the fat silkworm.</p><p>Perhaps sensing the aura of the Nine Nether Demonfire, the fat silkworm became agitated as soon as it left its container.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately moved the Demonfire Needle closer.  The fat silkworm frantically retreated, attempting to escape Qin Sang's grasp, but it was trapped by the true energy cage.  In its almost invisible eyes, fear was evident, and it let out sharp hissing sounds.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonfire's effect was surprisingly good; the silkworm was even more terrified than if it had seen a natural predator.  It was absolutely petrified.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored it, her eyes icy, the Demonfire Needle drawing ever closer.</p><p>Suddenly, the fat silkworm stiffened and stopped moving.</p><p>It had apparently fainted from fright.</p><p>"Fainted? Such a useless thing.  Dead is even more useless.  Might as well burn it,"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, flicking her finger. A wisp of Nine Nether Demonfire shot towards the silkworm.</p><p>A scream rang out; the silkworm sprang up and fled desperately, having been feigning death.  But it was confined within the cage, and its speed was far inferior to the Nine Nether Demonfire. It was instantly engulfed.</p><p>The fat silkworm rolled its eyes, this time truly fainting.  Whether it was saliva or tears, a pool of liquid flowed from its body from the fright.</p><p>A smile touched Qin Sang's lips as she transformed the Nine Nether Demonfire into chains, binding the silkworm.</p><p>After a while, the silkworm awoke, but before it could rejoice, it saw the Demonfire chains and fainted again.</p><p>This went on several times until the silkworm finally became numb.</p><p>At this point, its gaze towards Qin Sang had changed; it looked at her like a great demon, filled with intense fear, trembling, and pitifully vulnerable.</p><p>If it had sufficient intelligence, it might already be regretting its decision to join her.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't retract the Nine Nether Demonfire; she kept it bound with the fire chains, then took out a berry, squeezing some juice in front of the silkworm and staring at it with cold eyes.</p><p>This berry was a spiritual fruit, ideal for feeding spirit insects, especially during their first transformation, accelerating their growth. It commanded a high price in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang had obtained some from the Five Insects Sect.</p><p>Previously, the silkworm had completely ignored it, but now, without any urging from Qin Sang, it devoured it greedily, eating with extreme relish.</p><p>"Eat your fill and go back to sleep!"</p><p>Seeing the tears of gratitude welling up in the silkworm’s eyes, Qin Sang felt very satisfied.</p><p>After eating its fill, the fat silkworm crawled back into its container.  Now there was true peace and quiet.</p><p>Having dealt with the fat silkworm, Qin Sang set off again, arriving at the entrance to Butterfly Valley.</p><p>At this time of year, the climate in the Witch God Continent had turned cold, but Butterfly Valley was warm and fragrant with birdsong.</p><p>The scenery here truly lived up to its reputation—flowers bloomed in profusion, the entire valley seemingly covered in a carpet of blossoms. Several crystal-clear streams meandered through it, and bees and butterflies danced around the flowers.</p><p>After admiring the beautiful scenery, Qin Sang looked at the countless butterflies and fell into thought.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly is very timid; any slight movement would frighten it into hiding in its nest.  Things that entice other spirit insects are useless for the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rashly enter; she quietly circled the perimeter of Butterfly Valley, finding nothing unusual—every butterfly appeared ordinary.</p><p>Even if she caught all the butterflies in Butterfly Valley, it would be useless; the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's camouflage was too good, making it indistinguishable.  If it weren't for the Redfire Gold, Qin Sang couldn't think of a good way to lure the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Fearing that the corpse energy of the corpse might startle the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, Qin Sang could only do it herself.</p><p>She didn't dare to enter Butterfly Valley invisibly, as she didn't know if the Sky-Eyed Butterfly had completed its third transformation. If it had opened its sky-eye, any concealment techniques would be useless to it.</p><p>Qin Sang found an excellent hiding spot on the edge of Butterfly Valley where she could observe most of the valley. Then she took out the Redfire Gold and scattered it.</p><p>Then it was a matter of waiting patiently.</p><p>Butterfly Valley was vast. If the spirit insect's senses were acute, and if the Sky-Eyed Butterfly was still there, it should soon sense the aura of the Redfire Gold. But the Sky-Eyed Butterfly was timid and cautious; nobody could say for sure how long it would take to appear.</p><p>Qin Sang huddled in his hiding place, holding his breath and waiting patiently.</p><p>Catching the desired spirit insect in the wild is difficult.  Some solitary practitioners of witchcraft, lacking the established lineages, sometimes spend years squatting near a spirit insect nest, waiting for the insect to appear—this is common.</p><p>They might even waste several years only to find the nest empty in the end.</p><p>Qin Sang benefited from the Red Fire Gilded Liquid; it held immense allure for the spirit insects. This allowed him to quickly determine whether the insects were still present, eliminating six locations in less than a month.</p><p>The sun set, and the moon rose and fell.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a night passed.</p><p>The Butterfly Valley was even more beautiful at night. The stars above cast their reflections onto the stream, like jade ribbons weaving through the valley. Under the faint glow of bioluminescence, the flowers and butterflies seemed to be holding a grand ball.</p><p>The entire night passed without incident in the Butterfly Valley.</p><p>Until dawn.</p><p>A group of butterflies of various shapes and sizes flew over the stream. Their flight paths were erratic, sometimes left, sometimes right, sometimes up, sometimes down, sometimes fast, sometimes slow…</p><p>Sometimes, the group would suddenly scatter, then quickly regroup.  Some members would leave, others would join. When a flower caught their interest, they would dance around it, the group resembling a tiny embroidered ball.</p><p>This was a common sight in Butterfly Valley.</p><p>However, as the group of butterflies flew over a patch of grass, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, a gleam flashing within them.</p><p>A drop of Red Fire Gilded Liquid had disappeared!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted, fixing on the group of butterflies that had just flown over the grass.</p><p>His eyesight was excellent; even without using his spiritual sense, he could see clearly that the group consisted of nearly a hundred butterflies of various species. Their movements seemed no different from other butterfly groups.</p><p>Qin Sang examined each one, but they were all ordinary butterflies, without a single flaw.</p><p>He tentatively used his spiritual sense, enveloping the group, but found nothing.</p><p>"Incredible camouflage abilities!"</p><p>Qin Sang marveled inwardly. It was said that once a Sky Eye Butterfly concealed itself, even a Nascent Soul cultivator couldn't see through it.  Now it seemed the rumors were true.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was observing the group's movements, another drop of Red Fire Gilded Liquid was consumed.</p><p>"A feint?  Able to endure a whole night; it seems quite intelligent,"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled inwardly.</p><p>Since he had confirmed the Sky Eye Butterfly was present, he was relieved.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped tracking the group, focusing only on the closest drop of Red Fire Gilded Liquid, ready to act at any moment.</p><p>Having spent the night confirming there was no danger, the Sky Eye Butterfly finally succumbed to the lure of the Red Fire Gilded Liquid.  Its movements were swift; one drop after another was swallowed.</p>
