<h1>Chapter 2136: The New King</h1><p>The jade token's surface was smooth and round, devoid of any markings.  Qin Sang held it, sensing a subtle fluctuation.</p><p>According to Patriarch Yuanxiang, by taking the Zhuyan Clan's Great Transference Formation, he could reach the southern part of the Mist Sea. Upon arrival, activating this token would provide guidance.</p><p>Patriarch Yuanxiang remained tight-lipped about the identity of the person he would meet there, whether it was a cultivator from Purple Cloud Mountain or Master Liu Li herself.</p><p>Liu Li was supposed to return before the receding of the River of Calamity. It now seemed she must have encountered some trouble, preventing her from returning personally and prompting her to send someone to assist the Storm Realm in the struggle for the Azure Spiritual Qi.</p><p>The Azure Spiritual Qi was crucial for both sides. Without Qin Sang as a variable, the amount of Azure Spiritual Qi they could seize would influence the power dynamic for the next century.</p><p>Liu Li still cared about this matter, so her life shouldn't be in danger.  Yet, it was unknown what was holding her back.</p><p>“Many thanks to Patriarch Yuanxiang for relaying the message.” Qin Sang put away the jade token and cupped his hands in gratitude, not mentioning when he would depart.</p><p>Yuanxiang didn't inquire further. He took a sip of wine and rode a cloud westward.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling.</p><p>Purple Cloud Mountain hadn't set a deadline for the visit, but it was best to set off as soon as possible. Qin Sang considered the matters needing attention before his departure. Two things were essential: consolidating the insights gained from this battle and assisting Si Lu in swallowing the Hanjiang Lu Estate and reclaiming the throne of the Yan King.</p><p>While pondering, Li Yufu activated the cave dwelling's restrictive formation to report the results of the negotiations with Patriarch Minshu.</p><p>From now on, the two sides would use the border of the Holy Wood Plain as the boundary. The Changyou Clan would withdraw all its people back to the Holy Wood Plain and the southwestern seas, and the rest would belong to the Storm Realm.</p><p>Innumerable other treasures were included, among them the ancient classics Qin Sang had specifically requested.</p><p>This was all within expectations. Qin Sang entrusted this matter to Li Yufu and then secluded himself in his cave dwelling for several days before personally heading to the Siyou Clan.</p><p>…</p><p>The Siyou Clan.</p><p>The Hanjiang Lu Estate.</p><p>With King Lu personally leading the army on an expedition, the Lu Estate was left vulnerable. However, since the Yan Clan, once the strongest force on Yan Mountain, had been annihilated by the Lu Clan, and the Grand Protector enjoyed immense prestige, they weren't afraid of external threats.</p><p>However, some time ago, the atmosphere suddenly became strange. Overnight, various rumors unfavorable to the Lu Clan emerged, and many unfamiliar faces appeared around the Lu Estate.</p><p>With rumors running rampant, the Lu Estate grew increasingly oppressive, and various factions were restless. Ironically, the royal clan remained silent on the matter, with the Si Emperor remaining secluded and taking no action.</p><p>Just as people tried to discern the truth of the rumors, and the cultivators of the Lu Estate were filled with anxiety, the truth finally came to light.</p><p>Si Lu returned triumphantly, leading the remnants of King Lu's army, causing a great stir within the Siyou Clan.</p><p>Who could have imagined that King Lu, having dispatched his entire army to attack the mere remnants of the Yan King, would suffer such a crushing defeat? When the news of the deaths of both King Lu and the Grand Protector spread, it shocked everyone, and many refused to believe it was true.</p><p>Si Lu led his army in a direct advance toward the Hanjiang Lu Estate.</p><p>Atop a flying vessel, Si Lu stood at the bow, accompanied by Su Nu, with Zhuque perched on Su Nu's shoulder, dozing.</p><p>Shi Mu flew back from the front and reported, "Someone is blocking the path ahead, claiming to be former retainers of the Yan King, requesting an audience with the Young Master!"</p><p>Si Lu gazed ahead, his expression shifting slightly. "Bring them here."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Shi Mu left to carry out the order and quickly returned with three individuals.</p><p>One was an elderly man, another a young man, like a grandfather and grandson pair.  The last wore a wide-brimmed hat, which was actually a spiritual treasure, preventing others from seeing their face, their entire body shrouded in mist.</p><p>Si Lu stared intently at the hat-wearing figure, his expression filled with emotion.</p><p>The figure gently removed their hat, revealing a beautiful woman in palace attire.  Her gaze towards Si Lu was incredibly gentle, filled with deep satisfaction and affection.</p><p>“Aunt!” Si Lu exclaimed softly, moved. “You’re still alive!”</p><p>The Yan King’s descendants were all born through the union of yin and yang.  He had several consorts while alive.  Si Lu’s mother had passed away early, and this aunt was Consort Qi, the closest to him.</p><p>During the chaos, Steward Xia could only take Si Lu with him. They assumed that all the Yan King’s consorts had been killed.</p><p>Consort Qi, with a delicate demeanor no different from an ordinary woman, couldn't help but shed tears. "Lu'er, you've suffered these past years. The King’s spirit in heaven can finally rest in peace!"</p><p>"This old servant greets the Young Master!" The old man prostrated himself, also shedding tears. "This old servant failed the King’s trust, unable to avenge him, only able to苟活于世, watching helplessly as the enemy lived freely.  I deserve ten thousand deaths!"</p><p>The young man was more composed, reminding them, "Grand Marshal, are you still addressing him as Young Master?  It should be Your Majesty!"</p><p>After conversing, Si Lu learned of their experiences, sighing with emotion.  Unwilling to surrender to King Lu back then, they had secretly gathered the remnants of the Yan King's forces and endured countless pursuits.  Fortunately, the royal clan didn't want to see the Lu Clan become too powerful, so the Si Emperor issued a decree that allowed them to catch their breath.</p><p>Thanks to their secret efforts, a portion of the Yan King's forces had been preserved, and the hearts of the people hadn't completely dispersed.</p><p>They only learned of King Lu's expedition against Si Lu after he set out. They had intended to provide assistance, but were closely watched by the royal clan's experts and didn't dare to act rashly until the Grand Tutor returned, at which point the royal clan's experts withdrew.</p><p>Now, they pledged their allegiance with their forces, which Si Lu naturally welcomed.</p><p>With Consort Qi and the others returning, Si Lu's strength further increased, and the army continued its advance, with more remnants of the Yan King’s forces joining along the way.</p><p>These people might not have been truly loyal to the Yan King.  After the decline of the Yan Clan on Yan Mountain, they had led their own forces independently, becoming regional powers.  They had avoided Consort Qi and the others in the past, but they hadn't harmed them either.  Si Lu didn't turn them away.</p><p>The army quickly entered the Lu Clan’s territory. Si Lu ordered his forces to split into three routes, sweeping through the Lu Clan’s power base while preventing any remaining Lu Clan members from escaping.</p><p>Their advance was unstoppable, with enemies surrendering at the mere sight of their banners.  They encountered almost no significant resistance, and the three armies successfully converged at the Hanjiang Lu Estate.</p><p>Surrounded on three sides, the Lu Estate trembled.</p><p>Built along the Hanjiang River, the Lu Estate boasted magnificent scenery, with mountains like dragons on both sides of the great river. Mountains, rivers, lakes, and all were encompassed within the estate, creating a breathtaking vista.</p><p>Now, the Lu Estate's protective formation was operating at full power. A crimson banner rose from the river, stretching across the sky above the Lu Estate for thousands of miles. The banner's surface, soft as water, fluttered in the wind, obscuring the view of the estate within.</p><p>The banner was the manifestation of the protective formation.  Sensing the fluctuations emanating from it, it didn't seem to be outwardly strong but inwardly weak. It appeared that the Lu Estate's cultivators hadn't abandoned the estate and fled.</p><p>With the Lu Estate's remaining strength, they were completely incapable of resisting Si Lu’s army.  Yet, it was unknown what they were still waiting for.</p><p>“Young Master, should we send someone to break the formation now?”</p><p>The Grand Marshal stepped forward to request instructions, deeply troubled by the situation.</p><p>Si Lu hadn’t yet received his formal investiture, so his subordinates still addressed him as Young Master.</p><p>“No rush.”</p><p>Si Lu shook his head, calculating the time in his mind. It was best to wait for Qin Sang's arrival before making a move, using this battle to establish his authority!</p><p>“Order Shi Mu and the others to select some descendants of the Lu Clan’s vassal clans and bring them to the front to persuade them to surrender!”</p><p>The Grand Marshal's eyes lit up.</p><p>Many of the elite forces from the Lu Clan's vassals had been captured. This was a psychological tactic. When facing a stronger enemy, it remained to be seen how many clans were willing to perish alongside the Lu Estate!</p><p>At this time, various factions within the Siyou Clan were watching this battlefield, and the other two royal clans were also restless. Unexpectedly, the battlefield remained exceptionally calm for many days, with no sign of conflict.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Lu Estate.</p><p>Atop a mountain peak, the Grand Tutor stood with his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>Behind him, a dozen individuals clad in silver armor and helmets stood with restrained killing intent. The people of the Siyou Clan all knew that these were the Si Emperor’s Silver Guards, each a peerless expert.</p><p>Everyone silently watched the Lu Estate.</p><p>Soon, a shadowy figure appeared before the Grand Tutor. It was another Si Emperor’s Silver Guard, who saluted and reported, “Reporting to Grand Tutor, the Lu Estate has sent another memorial.”</p><p>The Grand Tutor was not surprised, and calmly asked, “What does the memorial say?”</p><p>“It’s much the same as their previous statements. They are willing to agree to all conditions, but with one exception: they've searched the entire Lu Estate and haven't found the Mirage Conch,” the Silver Guard reported.</p><p>The Grand Tutor frowned slightly and sighed. “It seems King Lu carried the Mirage Conch with him, and it has fallen into someone else's hands. What a pity.”</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, the Grand Tutor said, “Tell the Lu Estate to give them one day to choose some people and send them out along with those items. I will escort them to a safe place.”</p><p>The Silver Guard inwardly shuddered, knowing that these words were equivalent to a death sentence for the Lu Estate, preserving only a few members of the Lu bloodline. It was laughable that the Lu Estate still fantasized that the royal clan would help them drive away their enemies.</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>The Silver Guard departed.</p><p>At this moment, a Silver Guard who seemed to be a commander stepped forward. “It seems the Four Kings will become history.”</p><p>The Grand Tutor shook his head slightly. “Not necessarily! The Si Emperor originally intended to support the Wu Clan of Mist潭, uniting the other two clans against the Lu Clan.  If the new Yan King rises to prominence, we will need to bring the Wu Clan of Mist潭 back into play.”</p><p>“That Qin Zhenren is so formidable, even those two clans united might not be his match,” the Silver Guard Commander said.</p><p>The four-kings structure of the Siyou Clan was the most favorable arrangement for the royal clan, not only balancing the various factions, but also allowing them to check and balance each other.</p><p>Previously, the most powerful Yan Clan of Yan Mountain and the Hanjiang Lu Clan were locked in a fierce rivalry, while the other two clans checked each other.  Now the structure was completely broken, and a new balance needed to be sought.</p><p>“He is an outsider after all. Let’s wait and see,” the Grand Tutor said confidently.</p><p>In his view, the biggest winner of this turmoil was actually the royal clan. The Yan Clan of Yan Mountain and the Hanjiang Lu Clan fought each other to a point of mutual destruction.  The two most formidable experts who posed the greatest threat to the royal clan, Steward Xia and the Grand Protector, both perished.</p><p>Now Si Lu appeared to be in the ascendant, but an outsider stood behind him.</p><p>Aside from his humiliating retreat from the battlefield, it was a perfect outcome.</p><p>The battlefield remained quiet for some time.  Amidst everyone’s eager anticipation, Qin Sang finally arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu appeared high in the sky, overlooking the banner above the Lu Estate.</p><p>Suddenly, as if sensing something, Qin Sang glanced towards the area outside the battlefield before quickly retracting his gaze.</p><p>The Silver Guard Commander’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Did he discover us?”</p><p>“This Qin Zhenren’s spiritual sense is exceptionally keen.  It played a role in King Lu’s defeat,” the Grand Tutor said, unsurprised.</p><p>After gazing for a long while, Qin Sang discerned some clues.</p><p>“Although there are experts controlling the formation within, the formation’s power is unstable, revealing many weaknesses.  Perhaps your previous strategy has worked, and the Lu Estate’s cultivators are in disarray, their hearts susceptible…”</p><p>After some contemplation, Qin Sang pointed out several locations and ordered Shi Mu and the others to lead the army in an attack.</p><p>The battlefield shifted from stillness to motion.  Si Lu's forces launched a fierce offensive from the very beginning, their momentum overwhelming.  Beams of spiritual light rained down upon the Lu Estate, instantly engulfing the banner.</p><p>The earth trembled, and the sky changed color.</p><p>Occasionally, glimpses of the banner could be seen through the gaps in the spiritual light, appearing exceptionally fragile and precarious.</p><p>Except for Qin Sang and Si Lu, who remained in the center, everyone else joined the battle.</p><p>Not long after the battle commenced, the results of the earlier persuasion attempts became apparent. Cultivators continuously fled from the Lu Estate, surrendering to their side.  Even from outside the formation, the chaos within the Lu Estate was palpable.</p><p>Qin Sang keenly sensed the changes in the banner. Like the Thunder Altar, the Lu Estate’s grand formation also required the concerted effort of other cultivators to assist the main controller.  Now, with the Lu Estate’s morale in disarray, its power was naturally diminished.</p><p>Those who remained steadfast were probably only the direct descendants of the Lu Clan.</p><p>In the face of such overwhelming odds, establishing authority through slaughter wouldn’t change the overall situation. Not long after the battle began, ripples spread across the surface of the banner.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  He appeared high in the sky, his mind connected to the Thunder Altar, and raised his finger towards the heavens.</p><p>'Rumble! '</p><p>Azure lightning appeared in the sky, with countless bolts streaking across.</p><p>The lightning converged, and at the center of the dazzling light, a thunder seal materialized, radiating overwhelming power.</p><p>“What kind of thunder technique is this?”  Astonishment flashed across the Silver Guard Commander's eyes.</p><p>The Grand Tutor’s expression became serious. He thought that although this thunder technique was powerful, what was truly awe-inspiring was that azure thunder paper, which was also the reason he strongly advocated against confronting Qin Sang before the Si Emperor.</p><p>Elsewhere, spies sent by various factions were equally stunned, staring blankly at the thunder seal in the sky, fear rising in their hearts.</p><p>'Boom! '</p><p>Azure lightning descended from the heavens, striking the banner.</p><p>Terrifying power erupted.  Simultaneously, Su Nu and the others received Si Lu’s command and launched an all-out assault.</p><p>Thunder echoed between heaven and earth.</p><p>The Hanjiang River surged with monstrous waves, and the mountains seemed to be on the verge of collapse. The banner's surface became enveloped in a layer of azure light, overwhelming its original color.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The might of the thunder continued to erupt.  The banner finally succumbed, a corner collapsing.  This seemed to be a signal, as countless cracks suddenly appeared across the banner's surface. Under the despairing gazes of the Lu Estate’s cultivators, it began to crumble from the outer sections inwards.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced down, then vanished from the battlefield, flying towards the mountain peak where the Grand Tutor was located.</p><p>“Qin Zhenren!”  The Grand Tutor bowed slightly.</p><p>“The situation was chaotic during the last battle, and I didn't have the opportunity to speak with Grand Tutor in detail. Please forgive me,” Qin Sang landed, returning the greeting with a smile.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang bring up the past, the Grand Tutor's expression remained unchanged. “It has been some time. Qin Zhenren’s divine might remains undiminished, and you will certainly be able to help Young Master Si Lu revitalize the Yan Clan of Yan Mountain.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards the battlefield and said calmly, “I previously promised to help Fellow Daoist Si Lu avenge his family. Now that his revenge has been fulfilled, I still have my own cultivation grounds to attend to and cannot stay for long.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The Grand Tutor's eyes flashed.  This was undoubtedly the best outcome.</p><p>As long as this Qin Zhenren knew his limits, the royal clan might be able to become friends with him.</p><p>Thinking of this, the Grand Tutor's expression softened, and a smile appeared on his face.  “Even without Qin Zhenren’s presence, no one would dare to provoke the Yan King. I forgot to mention that before I departed, the Si Emperor instructed me to bring the imperial decree and jade seals, formally investing Young Master Si Lu as the new Yan King!”</p><p>Following this, the two conversed amicably.</p><p>As if suddenly remembering something, the Grand Tutor asked, “I wonder if Zhenren found the Mirage Conch among King Lu's belongings?”</p><p>“Such a supreme treasure like the Mirage Conch, shouldn’t it be kept within the Lu Estate?  My cultivation grounds have been ravaged by war, and there is much to be rebuilt. With countless matters demanding my attention, I haven’t had the time to examine them. I truly wouldn’t know,” Qin Sang said with a smile.</p>
