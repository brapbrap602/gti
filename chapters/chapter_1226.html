<h1>Chapter 1218: Progress</h1><p>All went smoothly.</p><p>Approaching Hukou Pass, Qin Sang and the Serpent King were most vigilant, expecting a trap laid by the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no abnormalities in the Abyss of Sin, and they returned safely to the Skywalk Plateau.</p><p>The Serpent King remained at Hukou Pass to discuss matters concerning Ye Laomo and the Blood Lake with Yu Wang. Ye Laomo is extremely ambitious and his strength is unfathomable; the demon race must prepare in advance.</p><p>He would return to the mountain to recover his injuries after Qin Sang contacted the Two Realms Alliance and came to testify.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to Shiqu Mountain alone, openly visiting his senior sister.</p><p>After his previous visit to Shiqu Mountain, Qin Sang and his senior sister had exchanged several letters, and their relationship was now openly cordial, eliminating the need for clandestine meetings as before.</p><p>“Junior Brother, have you just returned from the Abyss of Sin? Did you encounter anything unusual there?”</p><p>Qing Jun’s cave abode was located within a former prince's mansion in the city.</p><p>She was in seclusion when Qin Sang arrived.</p><p>Waiting in the hall, Qin Sang saw his senior sister enter, feeling the entire hall brighten.  She was still in her fiery red dress, a striking contrast to the cold demeanor he had sensed the first time he saw her.</p><p>However, as he drew closer, he still perceived a certain detachment from the world, consistent with her philosophy of life.</p><p>At one time, she had made herself into a puppet, suppressing her emotions and inner demons.</p><p>He wondered if her personality, cultivation, and other aspects had been affected by that experience now that the threat of the Lifeless Demon Seal was gone.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had advanced to the Yuan Ying stage, his senior sister still felt mysterious to him, an enigma he could never fully comprehend.</p><p>“Is it necessary to have something to report before visiting my senior sister?”</p><p>Qin Sang rose, offering a smile, then his tone changed, becoming grave. “I encountered some interesting things in the Abyss of Sin. I'd like to ask for your opinion.”</p><p>“Oh? Could the Abyss of Sin really be connected to the ancient demons? Did you discover any clues?”</p><p>Qing Jun waved her hand, creating a soundproof barrier.</p><p>“Not exactly.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>This time, he had practically explored every significant area of the Abyss of Sin, including the Abyssal Ruins, yet found no evidence linking it to the ancient demons.</p><p>Senior and junior brother sat facing each other.</p><p>Qin Sang continued, “I unexpectedly found a passage in the Sky Scar and entered the Abyssal Ruins.”</p><p>Qing Jun's eyes flickered in surprise. “Back then, after careful consideration, fearing discovery and being trapped to death, I didn't dare to trespass. I never imagined that my junior brother would be so courageous as to enter the Abyssal Ruins.”</p><p>“Most Yuan Ying cultivators from the Abyss of Sin are engaged at the front lines. The danger level in the Abyssal Ruins is incomparable to what it was then. Besides, I had an escape route.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  “I met Ye Laomo in the Abyssal Ruins…”</p><p>Qing Jun was slightly taken aback, her expression serious as she listened to Qin Sang recount his encounter.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ye Laomo had only engaged in a few brief skirmishes during pursuits, so he didn't know much about Ye Laomo. He could only describe what he had discovered and let his senior sister judge whether it was the real Ye Laomo or a clone.</p><p>Then Qin Sang also explained the matter of the Blood Lake.</p><p>After a moment of silent contemplation, Qing Jun said, “I once assisted True Daoist Master, witnessing his battle with Ye Laomo. The artifact you mentioned is likely Ye Laomo’s Blood Moon Wheel. However, this person’s knowledge is quite eclectic; he not only masters bloodline techniques but also possesses profound skills in five-elemental techniques and other demonic arts, making him exceptionally difficult to deal with. During the time you were away, the two sides have been relatively calm, with only minor skirmishes.  While we haven't seen Ye Laomo make a move, we can't definitively say it was a body double.”</p><p>“Ye Laomo felt more dangerous to me than even the true mid-Yuan Ying peak cultivators in the Canglang Sea. Using only bloodline techniques, he fought two of us, almost forcing me to use all my skills."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, “If Ye Laomo has a clone of this level, even without the ancient demons, we need to consider our retreat.”</p><p>Qing Jun showed no concern, raising her eyes and smiling faintly. “Cultivating corpses, creating clones, second primordial spirits, puppets—such techniques that exceed the cultivator's own strength are not uncommon.  They either require an immense expenditure of energy or a great stroke of luck. Ye Laomo has been stuck at the mid-Yuan Ying peak for years, unable to break through, so it's quite normal for him to spend time refining a clone.  However, both True Daoist Master and the Profound Darkness Demon Monarch are not simple opponents; let's wait and see…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought about it. He himself had a peak Golden Core clone when he was at the mid-Golden Core stage, though that was due to a special circumstance where he'd hit a cultivation bottleneck.</p><p>Ye Laomo, having dominated the Abyss of Sin for many years, and being unfathomable, possessing such a clone wasn’t surprising.</p><p>He had mentioned all this to remind his senior sister, but seeing her completely unfazed, he said nothing more.</p><p>Luo Ye Lao Mo, unmatched in power, wasn't one for reckless battles.  He took his entourage—the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea goblins and a few younger cultivators—to sea, living a carefree life.</p><p>After discussing Luo Ye Lao Mo, Qing Jun asked, "The Blood Lake incident requires careful consideration. Though I've never been there, I've heard tales; it's highly unusual.  We probably need to convene cultivators from both realms to discuss it.  You'll have to explain things firsthand, which might reveal your secrets."</p><p>"The Snake King is at Hu Kou Pass; he'll be there too."</p><p>Qin Sang had already discussed this with the Snake King. He preferred a less prominent role, attributing most of the credit to the Snake King, who jokingly called him cunning.</p><p>The senior and junior disciples exchanged a few more words.  Qin Sang seized the opportunity to ask his senior sister about some cultivation difficulties. Qing Jun easily answered them, providing Qin Sang with much guidance.</p><p>This further deepened Qin Sang's understanding of his senior sister's abilities.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, more than two hours had passed.</p><p>Qin Sang took his leave to see Mei Gu, inquiring about her progress.</p><p>Qing Jun's current appearance wasn't suitable for going out, so she only saw Qin Sang to the hall entrance. "I almost forgot! I've been studying the Binding Demon Rope lately and have made some headway.  I wonder if all this effort will ever be useful."</p><p>"Better safe than sorry."</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly hoped it wouldn't be necessary. Ancient demons were terrifying; he didn't want to encounter another one.</p><p>Leaving the mansion, Qin Sang went to the courtyard they had visited before.</p><p>Soon, Mei Gu arrived after receiving a signal.</p><p>Qin Sang sized up his newly adopted disciple, nodding.  "Excellent. Your cultivation has improved again."</p><p>"Thank you, Master, for the spirit pills."</p><p>Mei Gu's expression was ecstatic. "Also, following your instructions, I gained insights during battle, which led to this significant progress."</p><p>This was experience Qin Sang had accumulated while cultivating his killing technique, more than enough to guide Mei Gu.</p><p>He pondered for a moment. Later, he could rotate Li Yu Fu and the others to the front lines for training. With him watching over them, their safety wasn't a concern.</p><p>"You seem very pleased.  Have you made any progress?"</p><p>Qin Sang put aside his thoughts, smiling at his disciple.</p><p>Mei Gu said with a grin, "You can't hide anything from Master's discerning eye. I've been actively befriending that cultivator, subtly inquiring, and gathering bits of information.  Collectively, it's enough to confirm certain things."</p>
