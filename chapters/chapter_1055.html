<h1>Chapter 1447: The Witchcraft Formation</h1><p>Chapter 1447: The Witchcraft Formation</p><p>The Sky Tower.</p><p>A group of Wu people passed through the valley's restrictions and found the stone hall.  The hall was pitch black inside. Upon entering, they discovered that, unlike the dangerous restrictions outside, there were none within. However, they dared not recklessly unleash their spiritual senses and could only carefully investigate.</p><p>Fang Laomo was still leading the way.</p><p>The space here was larger than they had imagined.  Seeing that there seemed to be nothing unusual, the Grand Witch Priest ordered everyone to remain vigilant and then dispersed slightly.</p><p>"There are corpses ahead!"</p><p>Fang Laomo suddenly transmitted a voice message.</p><p>Everyone's expressions tightened, and they quickly gathered behind Fang Laomo.  Their spiritual senses swept forward, and indeed, they found numerous corpses lying scattered on the ground.</p><p>These corpses had been there for an unknown length of time, reduced to mere bones. Fang Laomo sent out a gust of wind, which hit one skeleton, causing it to crumble into dust—completely decayed.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priest's expression turned serious.  They surveyed the area and said, "Everyone, be careful."</p><p>Fang Laomo paused briefly, then flew forward again. Everyone brought out their protective talismans and followed closely behind.</p><p>"What are the chances of finding Wu relics in this abandoned place, do you think?"</p><p>Fang Laomo communicated privately with the Grand Witch Priest, his tone slightly dissatisfied.</p><p>The stone hall gave them only a feeling of emptiness and desolation. Besides the corpses scattered everywhere, there was nothing else.  There was not even a trace of restrictions or spirit formations.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priest reassured him, "Fang Dao you, please be patient. That stone disc is clearly a Wu treasure.  The activation of the stone disc opened the stone hall; isn't that enough proof of its connection to our Wu people? This hall may have been built by our Wu ancestors, but its location within an ancient human sect's secret realm must have a reason."</p><p>"I hope your judgment is correct."</p><p>Fang Laomo said calmly, then fell silent. Suddenly, he increased his speed and darted forward.</p><p>After flying for a while, Fang Laomo abruptly stopped. The Grand Witch Priest caught up and, seeing what was ahead, a strange expression flickered in their eyes.</p><p>Directly in front of them stood a massive stone pillar. The pillar emanated an ancient aura, its surface intricately carved with complex patterns that almost covered the entire pillar.  When their spiritual senses scanned the pillar, they detected no fluctuations—it was not under any restrictions, nor was it a magical artifact.</p><p>But a look of excitement appeared in the Grand Witch Priest's eyes.  They rushed to the pillar and gently touched the carvings with a finger, exclaiming, "The aura of these patterns is identical to the divine runes. If I'm not mistaken, this is a unique formation of our Wu people, mentioned in the ancient texts!  There must be more than one pillar here. Everyone…"</p><p>Before they could finish, everyone understood and dispersed to search for more pillars.</p><p>Soon, all eight pillars in the stone hall were found, positioned perfectly in the eight directions, forming a grand formation.</p><p>They carefully recorded the patterns on each pillar, gathered together, and began to analyze them.  But Wu inheritance was scarce; their understanding of this formation was minimal, and after much study, they had no leads, so they decided to try activating the pillars themselves.</p><p>Yet even using the power of divine runes, the pillars remained unresponsive.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priest's eyebrows furrowed. They had not expected this and were at a loss.</p><p>At that moment, Fang Laomo circled the pillars, seeming to discover something.  They said, "Could these pillars have lost their power due to the passage of time?"</p><p>"The restrictions outside the hall remain intact.  The pillars were hidden within the hall, untouched by anyone; how could they have deteriorated sooner?"</p><p>A Wu elder doubted.</p><p>"That depends on the purpose of this formation.  The outer restrictions likely didn't have only this much power initially. They too must have been weakened by time, allowing passage with just two wind-extinguishing nails. The Grand Witch Priest just now suspected that this formation was related to a seal. If the demon inside didn't die and kept assaulting the seal, it's possible that it eventually broke the formation."</p><p>Fang Laomo said calmly.</p><p>"The demon has broken the seal?"</p><p>Everyone was startled.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priest's expression remained unchanged. "Everyone, there's no need to worry.  Anything powerful enough to be sealed jointly by the human and Wu races… you can imagine what kind of being it was. The pillars lost their power long ago. If the demon had broken the seal and escaped, the Canglang Sea would have been devastated."</p><p>Looking at these remains, some strangely shaped, they might be demons sealed here, already turned to bone before the seal dispersed...”</p><p>The High Priest suddenly moved, flying towards the center of the large formation.  Brushing aside the bones to reveal the smooth ground, the High Priest’s spiritual sense swept over it.  His eyes narrowed, then he made a hand seal and pressed down slowly.</p><p>A rumbling sound echoed, and a descending stone staircase appeared before them.</p><p>“There’s another level below!”</p><p>A mixture of shock and delight rippled through the group. Shock, because the demons sealed below would undoubtedly be stronger; should they accidentally release even one, disaster would follow. Delight, because a lower level seal might still be intact, offering a glimpse into the Witch Clan's ancient ways.</p><p>“If you find similar seals below, be sure to record them. It will aid in understanding the Divine Rune Path. Even if we don't find our ancestors' treasures, this journey will not have been in vain,” the High Priest instructed.</p><p>Old Fang was the first to descend.</p><p>The second level was much smaller than the first. They quickly found a second seal, different from the stone pillars on the first level, yet clearly crafted by the same Witch Clan ancestors.</p><p>Using a similar method, they found the entrance to the third level.</p><p>Everyone grew more cautious. Old Fang, using some unknown secret technique, appeared and disappeared, his form almost ethereal.</p><p>After receiving a message from Old Fang, they cautiously entered the third level.  The sight that met them was surprising.</p><p>The third level was the smallest, only about ten meters across.  In the center of a stone chamber stood a circular stone platform surrounded by eight stone pillars, though not as tall as those on the first level.  However, the carvings on these pillars were far more exquisite and profoundly mysterious than those above.</p><p>The platform was empty, no bones, no sealed demon as they had expected.</p><p>Old Fang hovered near the platform, gazing at one of the pillars, then announced a startling discovery: "This array still retains some residual power!"</p><p>The High Priest’s face lit up. He dashed to the platform, observing cautiously for a while before intently studying the array.</p><p>The third level was small, so the others quickly searched, confirming the absence of any demons. They too approached the pillars to examine them.</p><p>Silence fell over the chamber, creating an eerie scene.  Everyone stared intently at the seemingly ordinary pillars, as if they were some priceless artifact.</p><p>But eventually, including Old Fang, they all gradually looked away, shaking their heads silently.</p><p>Only the High Priest remained thoughtful.</p>
