      Twenty days had passed since the Godoran fleet suffered from
                their huge shock.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After that incident, everyone in the Godoran fleet had been
                living on edge. They did not even dare take too long in the
                toilet lest they followed in the footsteps of their commander
                and ended up with a face full of piss.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Thankfully, Ames had gone elsewhere to play, and even before she
                left Planet Aquamarine, Barette did not dare voice a single word
                of complaint to her.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Hila and Aurora did not leave together with Ames but stayed back
                on Planet Aquamarine to aid in the disaster relief operation.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, they had already accepted Ames’ offer and had the title
                of ‘Dragon Emperor disciple’.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ames understood the current circumstances of Planet Aquamarine
                and did not force the both of them to leave immediately. After
                the mutation disaster was over, Han Xiao would personally escort
                them to Floating Dragon.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After witnessing Ames’ strength, Hila understood the distance
                between herself and a top-notch expert. Experts were like clouds
                in the universe, and Hila clearly understood that she was still
                extremely weak and would not be able to protect her sister.
                Thus, she did not reject Ames’ good intentions. It could be said
                that paranoia was her greatest source of motivation to seek
                strength.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In truth, ever since Han Xiao returned, Hila had understood that
                her future could not be restricted to Planet Aquamarine, and she
                would have to step into a higher realm one day. Originally, she
                could not let go of her pride to follow Han Xiao into the galaxy
                with her little sister. However, Ames’ unexpected interference
                became her greatest opportunity.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao approved of her decision. While Hila had great
                potential, her current strength could not keep up with him. If
                she trained under the Dragon Emperor, it should be extremely
                beneficial to unearthing her potential. She would then be able
                to grow rapidly and help him when the time came.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In the past month, the construction of his base had largely been
                completed. The players worked tirelessly day and night and
                remodeled the Sanctuary into a Main City.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Main City region was a region within the inner region of the
                city. New cable lines were laid, and the energy core of the
                Sanctuary had also been changed into a stable galactic level
                reactor. The abundant energy source was directed into the
                protective shield that covered the entire Main City and the
                Electromagnetic Rail Cannon that was deployed in a six-sided
                star formation.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After days of laborious work, a portion of the Main City had
                been demarcated as the ‘Black Star Second Base’. Surrounding the
                Main City were the seven subsidiary cities constructed for the
                refugees. The size of the subsidiary cities was far larger than
                the Main City, and this region was named ‘Black Phantom
                Sanctuary’. The second base was far more technologically
                advanced than Planet Aquamarine, and it was impenetrable to any
                organization on Planet Aquamarine. Even if the Six Nations
                attacked together, they would not be able to do anything to the
                base.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The city plan was extremely obvious. It separated the city into
                the Black Star base, which was the inner city, and the refugees’
                outer city. This was the preliminary form of the Black Star
                Mercenary Group’s base on Planet Aquamarine.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Because Han Xiao had sufficient funds, the majority of the
                base’s facility had been bought. The advantage of spending money
                was that it saved a great deal of time. Han Xiao also
                constructed another two assembly lines during his free time. One
                was an electromagnetic firearm with a decent strength for the
                players, and the other was a low-grade energy shield. Both were
                suitable for the players at their current level.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      While the first base also had the assembly line for those two
                pieces of equipment, it was important for the second base to
                have some production as well to ensure that the goods would not
                be out of stock.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Currently, most of the players were above level 60 and had gone
                through the first Race Evolution. The players had begun
                leveling, which resulted in Han Xiao’s harvest of experience
                points being lowered. However, the wallets of the players had
                also became fatter. Enas had gradually begun to replace the
                local currency.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Other than Frenzied Sword and the others, the players also began
                to have some spare cash, and a small portion of the players had
                begun purchasing the goods in the faction store. In the past
                month, Han Xiao had received 380,000 Enas from the sale of his
                low-grade machinery.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      While the total expenditure of the players was far lower than
                that of the experts who followed him into the galaxy, it was
                still a good start.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Taking away the expenditure used to construct the base, Han Xiao
                still had 4.8 million Enas left in savings.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Apart from those two events, the situation on Planet Aquamarine
                had been stable over the past month, and the storm in Godora did
                not seem to have affected Planet Aquamarine.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The second phase of the Mutation Disaster was slowly brought
                under control, and the mission progress of the Main Storyline
                mission rapidly increased. It seemed as though everything was
                getting better, but Han Xiao knew that this was only the calm
                before the storm.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Then, the change finally came.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Godora had come up with the antidote!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Nagakin escorted the antidote over in secret and immediately
                came to find Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Black Star, the research department created an antidote based
                on the sample that you provided. Planet Aquamarine is one of the
                regions chosen to test the antidote.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Nagakin took out his communicator and displayed a confidential
                document on the screen. Information on the antidote was recorded
                in the document, and he sent it over to Han Xiao to take a look.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After briefly glancing through it, Han Xiao’s eyes lit up. “Two
                types of antidote?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Yes, the research department discovered the modus operandi of
                the Mutation Source and detected a radioactive reaction in the
                Mutation Source’s ability. Thus, the first antidote that they
                created is a type of machine. It is able to disrupt the energy
                waves of the Mutation Source within a certain region and reduce
                the radioactive reaction of the Mutation Source. This will
                reduce the hormonal reaction of the infected individuals during
                their outbreak, which allows the infected individuals to control
                their actions during the outbreak of the virus. It can be
                understood as weakening the control that the Mutation Source has
                over the infected individuals.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao nodded. “This way, as long as we can install this
                machine, all the infected individuals within a certain radius
                won’t need the suppressant.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The production of the suppressant was not able to satisfy the
                needs of the refugees. Furthermore, the suppressant could only
                be given to an individual, but Godora’s disruptor was able to
                suppress the virus within a fixed range, which was far more
                efficient. It could be said to resolve the present difficulty
                that they were facing.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “The second antidote is a type of injection, and its effect is
                to break down the molecular structure of the Mutation Source,”
                Nagakin said in a deep voice. “As long as it is injected into
                the Mutation Source, we will be able to destroy the Mutation
                Source!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The picture on the information was a tube containing a white
                gel-like substance.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Indeed…” Han Xiao’s eyes turned solemn.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Mutation Source was capable of absorbing energy, and the
                majority of attacks had limited effectiveness. Its life force
                was extremely stubborn, and as long as it was not destroyed
                completely, it would be able to grow again. This injection was
                its nemesis, and it was able to destroy the internal balance of
                the Mutation Source and create a chain reaction to destroy its
                molecular structure from within.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The second antidote was the way to solve the problem at its
                roots!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In his previous life, the Mutation Source had grown to a
                considerably powerful level, and it had been able to convert its
                stored energy into combat strength. The players had worked
                together with the Godorans and fought the Mutation Source like
                they were fighting a Boss. While there was only a single
                opponent, the Mutation Source had been able to control a large
                number of infected beasts, and the scale of that battle had been
                extremely large.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Because of Han Xiao’s influence, the final battle was brought
                forward by a year, and the strength of the Mutation Source was
                far from his previous life. This meant that the difficulty of
                the [Mutation Disaster] mission had dropped greatly!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “This means that our mission is to find the Mutation Source on
                Planet Aquamarine. However, this is like finding a needle in a
                haystack. Do you have any other ideas?” Han Xiao asked.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Yes! Apart from the two antidotes, the research department also
                created a detector to detect the Mutation Source’s energy waves!
                As long as the Mutation Source is within two thousand meters for
                more than ten seconds, the detector will be able to lock onto
                the location of the Mutation Source. Jeez, time is limited, and
                the research department was only able to create such a
                detector.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Nagakin took out a palm sized detector that looked like a
                radioactive detector.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao took the detector and mused, “While it is only able to
                lock onto its target within two thousand meters, it is still
                much better than searching blindly. Eh? The structure of this
                detector seems very simple.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Yes, after understanding the workings of the Mutation Source,
                it was extremely easy to create this detector. The cost is not
                too high.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao’s eyes lit up, and he caught the scent of a new
                business opportunity. “That’s great! Get the research department
                to send me the blueprint. I shall create detectors in bulk and
                issue them to the Inhumans. Then, I will get them to spread out
                across the entire planet to carry out a large-scale search!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Wouldn’t it be faster to send out a spaceship?” Nagakin asked
                with doubt.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Not necessarily.” Han Xiao shook his head. “The detector only
                reacts within two thousand meters, and it can be seen as a
                sphere with a two-thousand-meter radius. With an increase in
                altitude, the detection radius will decrease. At an altitude of
                two thousand meters, only the tip of the sphere will be left.
                The spaceship will have to fly at a very low altitude for the
                detector to be effective. Furthermore, the detector will only be
                able to lock onto the Mutation Source after ten seconds, so the
                spaceship has to continue flying at a low altitude. And don’t
                forget that the Mutation Source is able to move.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “In comparison, why not gather manpower to perform a search on
                the ground? Apart from the Inhumans, the army of the Six Nations
                can also help. Only then can we ensure that not a single region
                will be missed.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Nagakin was stunned for a moment. He felt as though something
                was wrong but also felt as though Han Xiao’s words made sense.
                Thus, he nodded and said, “Then let’s just do as you’ve said.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao revealed a smile as he heard that.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      All this while, the Sanctuary and Godora could only react
                passively to the Mutation Disaster and were completely helpless
                before the Mutation Source. This time, everything was different.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      With those three new items, Godora could finally go on the
                offensive and end the Mutation Disaster!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       I’ve been waiting for this day!
      </em>
      Han
                Xiao’s eyes glowed sharply.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Two days later, the Sanctuary and Six Nations had completed
                their setup of the equipment to suppress the Mutation Source.
                They had finally broken free from their reliance on the
                suppressant, and the most recent virus outbreak proved the
                effectiveness of the equipment.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      While the infected individuals would still have the various
                different emotions, their rationality would prevail. Those who
                had a stronger will would be able to suppress the impulse that
                they felt during the outbreak of the virus.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Furthermore, a strong will was the current specialty of the
                Planet Aquamarine citizens, who were currently going through a
                disaster.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The refugees finally had a sense of security and no longer lived
                in fear. While the Mutation Disaster had not been completely
                resolved, the citizens of Planet Aquamarine finally saw the hope
                of overcoming the Mutation Disaster.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The happiest individual was naturally Emerald Grass. She no
                longer had to work overtime to grow the raw materials of the
                suppressant and could relax.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After relaxing, Emerald Grass could finally see the bright smile
                on the faces of the refugees. At the same time, those smiles
                seemed to tug on her heartstrings, and she could finally see how
                many lives she had saved through her actions.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Such a feeling made her feel extremely special and warm.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Bennett and the leaders of the Six Nations could also heave a
                sigh of relief. They did not know of the fact that Han Xiao was
                the one who had provided the sample and thought that everything
                was a result of Godora’s effort. As such, they all expressed
                their gratitude to Nagakin and the other members of the disaster
                relief squad.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This made Nagakin feel extremely awkward. The person with the
                greatest merit was a member of Planet Aquamarine, but all of
                them had actually run over to thank him!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, he still made sure to keep Han Xiao’s actions a secret.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In the eyes of the players, the storyline was not that
                complicated at all. They only knew that Godora had suddenly
                developed a piece of equipment to suppress the virus, which
                caused the difficulty of the Main Storyline Mission to fall
                greatly.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At this moment, the Black Star Mercenary Group suddenly issued a
                mission that attracted the attention of all the players.

      “My goodness! The reward of this mission is so high!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “10,000 Enas‽ Oh my goodness!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “We are still able to affect the Main Storyline Mission
                progress? It seems like this is a very important mission!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Is this a sign that the Mutation Disaster storyline is about to
                end?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This mission set off huge waves on the Planet Aquamarine forum,
                and all the players were immediately fired up!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At the players’ current level, the reward of this mission was
                truly too high!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The total reward that Han Xiao could give out grew rapidly
                together with the strength and size of his mercenary group!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The million or so experience points were already stunning, but
                this was not the main point. The main point was the 10,000 Enas
                that were akin to more than a hundred daily missions!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Not just that, the Favorability points of the Black Star
                Mercenary Group were also extremely valuable, and there was even
                NCO Class armor. This was equipment that the players who had
                followed Black Star into the galaxy were wearing! All the
                players had long been extremely envious!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Such plentiful reward had truly excited all the players.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      It would not be an exaggeration to say that this was the mission
                with the highest reward that they had even seen.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Practical rewards were far more useful than a long mission
                introduction. The players all charged into the Black Star
                Mercenary Group base to accept the reward, and the door almost
                burst apart.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Very quickly, players found out that the [Mutation Source]
                mission required a special device that could be bought in the
                faction store. This time, everyone could purchase this
                equipment.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The players all opened the faction store excitedly to find their
                target. Very quickly, the introduction of the equipment entered
                their eyes.
