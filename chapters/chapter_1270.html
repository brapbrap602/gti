<h1>Chapter 1262: Breaking the Seal</h1><p>Seeing that Elder Tianzheng remained silent, the Nether Demon Lord spoke up repeatedly, "Since it's an ancient cultivator and not a supreme treasure, capturing him would benefit everyone. With just your Sin Abyss faction, you probably can't handle it alone. Why fight to the death? If something unexpected happens, it'll be too late to regret!"</p><p>Elder Tianzheng glanced at the Demon Lord Ye.</p><p>The fluctuations from the Blood Pool's seal grew increasingly violent, on the verge of breaking.</p><p>Elder Tianzheng was indeed somewhat worried. Although he had used demonic techniques to probe the seal and determined that the ancient cultivator was likely at the end of his strength, unable to cause any major trouble, the methods of ancient cultivators were unpredictable. If something went wrong and they were restrained by their enemies, relying solely on Demon Lord Ye might not be enough to suppress the ancient cultivator.</p><p>If the ancient cultivator escaped, it could indeed lead to a catastrophe, just as the Nether Demon Lord had warned.</p><p>Times had changed, and their plans had been exposed by the Cold Domain. The situation was not favorable.</p><p>As the Nether Demon Lord had said, the Purple Palace held countless treasures, and the Sin Abyss faction alone couldn't swallow them all. Negotiating a fair distribution of benefits, jointly imprisoning the ancient cultivator, and exploring the Purple Palace together might be a viable option.</p><p>However, Demon Lord Ye seemed to ignore the Nether Demon Lord's words entirely. His fingers moved like lightning, showing no intention of negotiating with the Cold Domain, as if he were fully confident.</p><p>Seeing this, Elder Tianzheng had no choice but to set aside his doubts and focus on fully activating his treasure.</p><p>As the Nether Demon Lord spoke, Qin Sang and the other two had already passed through the ancient restrictions and entered the Star River Diagram.</p><p>Seeing the situation, they immediately understood their predicament and, without hesitation, activated their treasures, launching a full-force assault.</p><p>Elder Tianzheng, facing four opponents alone, found it increasingly difficult to hold his ground. Even with his exquisite treasure, he was under immense pressure.</p><p>The space sealed by the treasure became unstable.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others, trapped within the starry river, exerted all their strength to break free.</p><p>A phantom of a demonic beast soared among the stars.</p><p>A sea of demonic flames, with the power to incinerate the world, engulfed countless stars.</p><p>A black pagoda, with a single tremor, caused a section of the starry sky to collapse.</p><p>In addition, the Nether Demon Lord continuously bombarded them with Yin Thunder.</p><p>Among the four, only the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon, having been trapped for many years, was slightly weaker. Each of the others was a formidable opponent. Elder Tianzheng gritted his teeth, sweat pouring down his face, and soon found himself unable to hold on.</p><p>Realizing he couldn't hold them off for long, he urgently sent a message to Jiang Chenzi to return and reinforce him, instructing him to set up the Banner Formation above the Blood Pool to buy time for Demon Lord Ye.</p><p>Within the Banner Formation.</p><p>Two great formations were colliding.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi and the others appeared relaxed at first, though the situation had initially been tense. However, the Banner Formation, linked to the Black Pagoda Formation, drew upon the power of the Black Pagoda Formation, making it as solid as a fortress and easily withstanding the enemy's attacks.</p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Chenzi's expression changed drastically, and he cried out, "We've been tricked! Retreat!"</p><p>Everyone's faces turned pale, and they immediately activated the Banner Formation to regroup with Elder Tianzheng.</p><p>Within the Reverse Nine Palaces Formation, Xiang Qing had been closely monitoring the changes in the Banner Formation. Seeing the blood light rapidly retreat and the surrounding pressure suddenly lessen, he immediately realized that the Nether Demon Lord had succeeded. He quickly ordered the formation's configuration to change.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The heavens and earth flipped, the ground rose, and the Nine Palaces reversed. The Reverse Nine Palaces Formation was completed in an instant.</p><p>The Nine Palaces hung high above, enveloping the Banner Formation.</p><p>At the same time, Jiang Chenzi and the others felt the three banners become unbearably heavy. An immense pressure descended from above, weighing them down as if they were trapped in quicksand.</p><p>The Reverse Nine Palaces Formation was designed for entrapment and slaughter!</p><p>In an instant, the roles were reversed, and Jiang Chenzi and the others found themselves trapped, unable to escape.</p><p>Although the Reverse Nine Palaces Formation was not as powerful as the Banner Formation, it was enough to hold Jiang Chenzi and his group for a while. In this critical moment where every second counted, it could be fatal!</p><p>With Jiang Chenzi unable to return in time, Elder Tianzheng felt a sense of foreboding. Suddenly, he heard a muffled thunderclap and saw a mass of Yin Thunder forcefully break through the starry river, heading straight for him.</p><p>Behind the Yin Thunder came demonic flames and the shadow of the pagoda.</p><p>Elder Tianzheng was horrified and dared not face it head-on. He quickly dodged.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The starry river suddenly shattered into pieces, and four figures flew out at high speed. The starry river reverted to its diagram form and flew back into Elder Tianzheng's hand.</p><p>Qin Sang, surrounded by demonic banners, broke through the Star River Diagram. With a quick glance, he saw Demon Lord Ye and his Blood Demon Avatar sitting above the Blood River.</p><p>"It really is an avatar!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.</p><p>The aura of this avatar was no weaker than the main body. Demon Lord Ye had hidden his strength well!</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a strong aura of blood and slaughter from the Blood Demon Avatar, very similar to the Demon Lord Ye he had fought in the Abyss Ruins, with only slight differences.</p><p>It had been many years since their last encounter, so this was to be expected.</p><p>Back then, the Blood Demon Avatar had chased Qin Sang and the Snake King like wild beasts.</p><p>Now, with both Demon Lord Ye's main body and avatar present, even though Qin Sang's strength had greatly improved, snatching anything from Demon Lord Ye's grasp would not be easy!</p><p>Fortunately, they had one more ally.</p><p>Four against threeâ€”they just needed to create an opportunity for Jingyu to strike!</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, but his movements didn't slow. He flew past Elder Tianzheng and charged straight at Demon Lord Ye!</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord and the others did the same.</p><p>Seeing this, Elder Tianzheng hurriedly activated the Star River Diagram again. The starry sea had just been broken, and he was powerless to stop the four. He could only throw the diagram out, aiming to entangle the Nether Demon Lord.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord was the strongest among them, so Elder Tianzheng decided to focus on him, leaving the others to Demon Lord Ye.</p><p>At the same time, he took out a spirit talisman and, with a glance at Qin Sang, immediately activated it. The talisman transformed into a Starry Warrior, whose aura was no weaker than a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Star River Diagram unfolded once more, conjuring a starry river that encircled the Nether Demon Lord.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord sighed softly. He had anticipated being targeted and knew he had to break the Star River Diagram first. It was a pity that Dongyang Bo had unexpectedly disappeared; otherwise, they could have secured victory today.</p><p>A dark light flashed in his dantian, and a black seal the size of a walnut flew out.</p><p>As soon as the seal appeared, ghostly wails filled the air, turning the starry sky into a ghostly realm.</p><p>While they were locked in a stalemate.</p><p>Qin Sang was blocked by the Starry Warrior, while Qingjun and the other two had already bypassed Elder Tianzheng.</p><p>At that moment, Demon Lord Ye, who had been sitting with his eyes closed, focusing on breaking the Blood Pool's seal, suddenly opened his eyes. A flash of blood-red light passed through his pupils.</p><p>Then, both he and his Blood Demon Avatar let out a roar, burning their essence blood. Fiery blood flames erupted from their bodies, condensing into a pillar of blood fire in their palms, which they slammed into the Blood Pool's seal.</p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Qingjun heard the Nether Demon Lord's urgent command, but it was already too late.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Demon Lord Ye and his group had been working on the seal for a long time, and it was already on the verge of breaking. With the impact of the blood fire pillar, the seal finally cracked open.</p><p>Having broken the seal, Demon Lord Ye glanced up at the group, his expression still impassive. Then, with a leap, he jumped into the Blood Pool.</p><p>Jingyu had come for the Corpse Flower Blood Amber within the Blood Pool and had no interest in the ancient cultivator.</p><p>If she couldn't obtain the Corpse Flower Blood Amber, she would die under the Heavenly Tribulation. Even if she obtained the Divine Transformation Secret Technique, it would be as useless as a reflection in a mirror. Therefore, seeing the seal broken, she didn't even glance at Demon Lord Ye and immediately rushed into the Blood Pool.</p><p>Qingjun was not far behind.</p><p>At that moment, the Blood Demon Avatar did not follow its main body into the pool. Instead, it summoned the Blood Moon Wheel and hurled it at Qingjun, while simultaneously pouncing at Jingyu!</p>
