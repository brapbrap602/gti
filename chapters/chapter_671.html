<h1>Chapter 663: Settling Down</h1><p>Du Han had been trapped at a bottleneck for many years due to demonic energy.</p><p>He had previously refined some spiritual medicines to purge the demonic energy with some success.  Consuming the Golden Orchid Grass would have enabled him to smoothly break through to the mid-stage of Core Formation, but sadly, he no longer had the chance.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the crystal and a jade box appeared in his palm.</p><p>Inside the jade box was a slender, glittering golden spiritual herb – the Golden Orchid Grass.</p><p>“Unexpectedly, some spiritual herbs that aren't highly valued in the Small Cold Realm are considered rare treasures here. Had I known, I would have collected more to bring over. I could have made a fortune.”</p><p>Qin Sang mocked himself.</p><p>He had acquired Du Han's Mustard Seed Bag and reaped a substantial harvest, so he wasn't in a hurry to sell the Golden Orchid Grass.  This type of spiritual herb was needed by all human Core Formation cultivators. It would be best used for bartering to maximize its value.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang categorized the items from Du Han's Mustard Seed Bag, transferred them to his Thousand Jun Ring, and destroyed the bag.</p><p>……</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>Thousand Households Village.</p><p>The old witch doctor, who had always been robust and, even now, could still personally climb mountains to gather herbs and hunt wild beasts, rivaling young men in strength, suddenly fell gravely ill and passed away within a mere hour.</p><p>The witch doctors invited from other villages had yet to arrive.</p><p>The old witch doctor was highly respected and held great prestige in Thousand Households Village. The villagers were deeply saddened but could only endure their grief as they arranged his funeral.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, on the day of the burial, the body laid to rest was actually that of an unknown elderly man.  At the same time, a dark cloud quietly rose from Green Peak across the river from Thousand Households Village and soared into the sky.</p><p>Within the cloud sat Qin Sang and the old witch doctor.</p><p>The old witch doctor remained silent, gazing at Thousand Households Village, where he had lived for decades.  Even after it disappeared from view, he continued to look back, his heart filled with reluctance.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's gaze, the old witch doctor retracted his gaze, wiped his eyes, and said self-deprecatingly, "I must be a laughingstock in the eyes of the Divine Envoy. Although I'm a solitary man, leaving Thousand Households Village so abruptly makes my heart feel strangely empty. It’s as if these everyday things have become inseparable bonds, tugging painfully at my heart…"</p><p>The old witch doctor’s face was filled with melancholy.</p><p>Qin Sang understood his feelings.</p><p>The old witch doctor had saved his life, so instead of using force, Qin Sang had invoked Ya Gu's name, coaxing and deceiving the old man into leaving.</p><p>The body in the grave was someone he had found elsewhere.  Using methods he'd learned in the mortal world, he ensured the body would decompose rapidly after burial.</p><p>This was done out of caution, though it wasn't strictly necessary.</p><p>When he had drifted down the river, entangled in branches and debris, covered in leaves, only Ya Gu and the old witch doctor had seen his severed arm.</p><p>Even if the Li Wu Palace came searching, without knowing the details, they wouldn't bother to exhume a commoner's grave.</p><p>"Rest assured, elder. Before Ya Gu entered seclusion, she instructed me to settle you in a safe place and ensure your prosperity for generations to come," Qin Sang promised.</p><p>The old witch doctor smiled wryly. "I'm accustomed to hardship. Whether I enjoy luxury or not is unimportant. I never thought that before entering the earth, I would be taken for a flight in the heavens by the Divine Envoy.  Now I finally understand the freedom of birds. It’s enough to make this life worthwhile."</p><p>After a moment of reflection, the old witch doctor suddenly became anxious.  "If the Divine Envoy hadn't mentioned it, I wouldn't have known that the world of immortals is so dangerous.  Since the Divine Envoy has only taken me, will they use others to threaten Ya Gu?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "Ya Gu only cares about you.  And you know her character; she wouldn't provoke trouble without reason.  Relocating you is merely a precaution."</p><p>The old witch doctor breathed a sigh of relief and said repeatedly, "As long as I'm not a burden to Ya Gu, I'm content.  An old man like me, close to death, can do anything. I watched that child grow up.  She suffered so much as a child, and she's so pure. I regret that I couldn't protect her during the Saintess selection. Fortunately, you, Divine Envoy, arrived.  This is Ya Gu's destiny, to finally find happiness after so much hardship, to become an immortal, something others wouldn't even dare to dream of. If she does anything improper, Divine Envoy, please, for the sake of her saving your life, be more forgiving.  Otherwise, send her back. I can live a few more years and still care for her…"</p><p>"Ya Gu is doing well.  She is diligently cultivating. Don't worry," Qin Sang said, lying.</p><p>The old witch doctor glanced at Qin Sang and sighed inwardly, not daring to disturb him further.</p><p>What the old witch doctor didn't expect was that this flight would continue without end. The black cloud carried them through towering mountains and deep valleys. He witnessed countless wonders beyond his wildest imagination.</p><p>From initial wonder, he eventually became numb.</p><p>The Divine Envoy beside him, aside from occasional brief conversations, remained in meditation.</p><p>For the first time, the old witch doctor understood the meaning of 'diligent cultivation.'</p><p>After an unknown number of sunrises and sunsets, the old witch doctor noticed that the mountains and rivers below were becoming less treacherous, with plains becoming increasingly common. He also saw several magnificent cities he had never encountered before, widening his horizons considerably.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, they were about to leave the Western Xinjiang region.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes and took out a map to check their location.</p><p>With the old witch doctor in tow and the need to avoid other Core Formation cultivators entering Western Xinjiang, Qin Sang had taken many detours, slowing their progress.  Fortunately, they had reached the edge of Western Xinjiang without incident.</p><p>The map indicated their current location was a small mortal kingdom under the control of the Li Wu Palace.</p><p>Traveling directly east would lead them deep into Li Wu Palace territory.</p><p>After consulting the map, Qin Sang immediately urged the Stygian Cloud to change direction, turning north to bypass the Li Wu Palace's influence.</p><p>He wasn't planning to leave the old witch doctor here.  He was heading to Smoothwave Port, a harbor on the northern end of the Wu Divine Continent.</p><p>Smoothwave Port was one of the most renowned ports on the Wu Divine Continent, a hub for many human merchant guilds and a place where contact with human cultivators was readily available.</p><p>Smoothwave Port was incredibly prosperous, with intertwined and complex power structures. However, being within Wu territory, humans didn't dare to be too ostentatious, all hoping to maintain the port's stability.</p><p>The Li Wu Palace's reach didn't extend to Smoothwave Port.  It would be the ideal place to find a mortal kingdom for the old witch doctor to settle down and enjoy his remaining years.</p><p>After leaving Western Xinjiang, the population density noticeably increased.</p><p>Qin Sang maintained a low profile to avoid encountering Wu Core Formation cultivators, even going so far as to disguise himself as a commoner and hire a carriage for travel. With his protection, the old witch doctor, despite his age, felt no fatigue.</p><p>Qin Sang also noticed that, being brought so far, the old witch doctor was becoming suspicious. However, he wasn't concerned. After settling the old man, he would seal his memories, particularly those related to the severed arm.</p><p>This matter was of utmost importance and couldn't be handled carelessly.</p><p>An unremarkable carriage sped along the road.  The curtain suddenly pulled back.  Qin Sang gazed south, towards the Li Wu Palace, his eyes indifferent.</p><p>Finally, he collected his thoughts and began to consider his plans for Smoothwave Port.</p>
