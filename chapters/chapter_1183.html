<h1>Chapter 1175: The Fire Melting Pill</h1><p>Soon, it was time to part ways.</p><p>Bai He and the Snake King's confidant returned to Qianshan Bamboo Sea, bringing the good news to Liu Yao and the white cat.</p><p>Qin Sang originally wanted to send Fat Chicken back as well.</p><p>Fat Chicken, however, was insistent, preferring to enter the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring rather than leave Qin Sang's side.  It claimed it would never be as reckless as its brothers and would obey Qin Sang's every command.</p><p>Qin Sang also felt the need for a servant, and since Fat Chicken was more perceptive than Bai He, he allowed it to stay.</p><p>With Fat Chicken in tow, Qin Sang headed towards Yu Ling Sect.  Earlier, Qin Sang and the Snake King had returned to Wan Yao City and obtained a decree from the Feather Yao King.</p><p>"Until we meet again!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed and left.</p><p>After Qin Sang disappeared into the distance, the smile on the Snake King's face gradually faded. He ordered his subordinates, "Quickly prepare for Yue'er's arrival. We must make a grand showing."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The subordinates left, leaving only the two Yao Kings.</p><p>"Father-in-law, was it necessary to be so polite to that boy, even sending Yue'er to him? That crane is shifty, more like a hooligan than anything else.  I'm worried he'll hurt Yue'er."</p><p>Qianji Yao Wang still disliked Qin Sang and was reluctant.</p><p>"Hooligan in front of me? I'll show him!"</p><p>The Snake King snorted. "Didn't you see Yue'er's expression?  She's completely smitten. What can I do?  A little indecisiveness won't hurt, you also have a favorite concubine, don't you think I know?  If Yue'er is upset because of a heartless man, I can handle it. She can come back later, it's a test for her."</p><p>Qianji Yao Wang, having failed to get his point across, quickly changed the subject.  "I failed to meet your expectations, Father-in-law. I couldn't force him to hand over the spirit insect. What are your plans now?"</p><p>The Snake King fell into thought.</p><p>"Your Xuan Yuan Poison Domain uses poison as a facade; its real power lies in illusion and restriction. Even I would struggle to break free in a short time."</p><p>"Yet he wasn't restricted at all. He always accurately located your true form and saw through your attacks."</p><p>"During the spirit insect's tribulation, you glimpsed a butterfly's shadow."</p><p>"Just now, the divine light that broke your Snake Emperor Shadow Technique came from a spirit butterfly's wings."</p><p>"Although its appearance differs slightly from the records, the butterfly wings have a pair of characteristic eyes. We were right; the four-stage spirit insect is most likely the rare Sky-Eyed Butterfly!"</p><p>Qianji Yao Wang frowned and pressed further, "Father-in-law, you've decided to invite him to the Abyss of Sin? Why didn't you tell him directly earlier?"</p><p>"They say a third-stage Sky-Eyed Butterfly possesses incredible Sky-Eye abilities, easily seeing weaknesses in restrictions. A four-stage Sky-Eyed Butterfly is even more formidable. Your Snake Emperor Shadow Technique was seen through as soon as a flaw appeared, leading to a backlash of your technique. This shows that Mingyue Yao Wang is the best choice for breaking ancient restrictions, especially in a place like that—the faster, the better.  Furthermore, his escape techniques and strength are extraordinary. Even I wouldn't be confident in defeating him today. Inviting him to the Abyss of Sin, even if it exposes our location, we won't be held back.  It's just..."</p><p>The Snake King hesitated, somewhat troubled.  "This person treats the Sky-Eyed Butterfly as his life; borrowing it is out of the question. But more people mean less treasure for each of us, I need to discuss this with Daoist Lu and the others first."</p><p>Hearing the Snake King's high praise of Qin Sang, Qianji Yao Wang felt very dissatisfied.</p><p>"With proper precautions, it's impossible for me to suffer another backlash. If Father-in-law hadn't stopped me, there would have been a fight!"</p><p>The Snake King advised, "It's something useless to you; don't let it become an obsession and create prejudice. When he agreed to duel you, I had a feeling, because he had to guard against me too.  He definitely has plenty of hidden strength. What he showed is not his full capabilities. To say nothing of the complete Ten Directions Yama Banner which has ten flags. Kui Yin Dao Ren was exceptionally talented, if he had not focused his energy on refining treasures, neglecting cultivation, his achievements would not have been inferior to Tong You Old Demon. Mingyue Yao Wang chose to duel outside Wan Yao City to establish his prestige, he will not remain hidden like Lao Zhu forever. The most frightening thing is that he has just broken through to the transformation stage. His future is limitless. Building good relations will not be wrong, let's just wait and see.”</p><p>Qianji Yao Wang's expression changed, and finally he sighed and nodded.</p><p>The two Yao Kings walked away.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang was flying towards Yu Ling Sect, recalling the battle.</p><p>Thanks to various supernatural powers and magic treasures, he had been at ease throughout his fight with Qianji Yao Wang. If it weren't for the restricted battlefield, he would have won even more easily.</p><p>He still had the Twelve Demon Banner Formation and the Summoning Thunder Technique concealed.</p><p>Furthermore, the ebony sword is refining the Soul-Nourishing Wood.  Soon, Qin Sang will possess a top-tier spirit sword.  </p><p>Then, the Seven Souls Killing Array will be even more powerful, along with the Blood-Pollution Divine Light—a sinister weapon.</p><p>Calculating my strength, I'm not weak at all.  When the opportunity arises, I'll definitely give Dongyang Bo a surprise he'll never forget!</p><p>Qin Sang's lips curled into a slight smile, summoning the Sky-Eye Butterfly. It was the greatest contributor to the recent gamble. The Sky-Eye Divine Light's first battle was a success.</p><p>Qin Sang gradually understood its workings. The effectiveness of the Sky-Eye Divine Light in breaking spells is related to the opponent's cultivation, the type of magical power, the casting speed, and the strength of the spell. It's not always effective, but it's definitely a great weapon in a magical battle.</p><p>"Let's go to the Yuling Sect to search through their classics later; maybe you'll find some spirit herbs you like…"</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the Sky-Eye Butterfly acting playfully and seeking credit.  He smiled gently and stroked it.</p><p>Flying over the mountains, Qin Sang arrived at Xianyao City. The Yuling Sect's mountain gate was just outside the city. Qin Sang went straight there.</p><p>He always wore a mask when traveling, a quirk the demon kings attributed to his personality, so no one commented.  While the Serpent Matriarch had seen his face, she certainly wouldn't guess that this demon king was the Shaohua Mountain disciple who won the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower.</p><p>The Yuling Sect had already received news and sent people to greet him at the mountain gate. Qin Sang learned that the Serpent Matriarch was absent, but the sect's deputy master could make decisions.</p><p>With the Feather King's edict, as long as Qin Sang promised not to reveal what he saw to anyone, he could access the treasure vault and examine the classics related to insect control.</p><p>Without any effort, Qin Sang found what he wanted.  The Yuling Sect's collection was truly impressive.  There were bamboo scrolls, jade slips, scripture tubes, and even stone books. Most were fragments, many very obscure.</p><p>There were even ancient scriptures about blood-feeding spirit insects that feed back cultivation to their masters.  Unfortunately, only a few words remained.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't miss a single one. He read slowly, spending a whole day in the vault studying and contemplating these insect control techniques, comparing them to those he'd obtained from the Witch Clan.  His gains were substantial.</p><p>To his disappointment, he didn't find any ancient texts related to the four-stage Sky-Eye Butterfly.  However, Qin Sang unexpectedly found a possible remedy for the Fire Jade Centipede in a jade slip:  the Fire Melting Pill.</p><p>The spirit herbs for the Fire Melting Pill weren't particularly rare and could be found in the present world. Gathering them wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>******</p>
