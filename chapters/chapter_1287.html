<h1>Chapter 1279: On the Eve of the Great Battle</h1><p>Chapter 1279: On the Eve of the Great Battle</p><p>South foot of the Tianxing Plateau, Shuangjing Mountain.</p><p>With speed being paramount, after the Ice Crystal Palace meeting, Qin Sang and Qing Jun led their army, traveling day and night, straight towards Zuyuan's large camp on Yuzhi Peak.</p><p>Zuyuan's attack from south to north has always been an uphill battle.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance occupies the advantageous terrain, using it to resist the enemy.  If they counterattack, it's like a tiger descending a mountain; Zuyuan would hardly gain a geographical advantage.</p><p>Shuangjing Mountain is an exception.</p><p>Shuangjing Mountain is one of the most famous peaks on the first tier of the Tianxing Plateau. The mountain is towering, even exceeding the height of the second tier, offering a wide field of vision and making it easy to defend and difficult to attack.</p><p>The north and south sides of the mountain have few rugged terrains, resembling two ice mirrors, slanted into the ground – the name Shuangjing (Double Mirror) originates from this, showcasing the perilous terrain.</p><p>Zuyuan has been entrenched on this mountain for many years, firmly establishing a large camp here, like a sharp thorn deeply embedded in the flesh, causing immense suffering to the Two Realms Alliance.</p><p>At any time, at least a Nascent Soul mid-stage expert is stationed here. Now that Cang Hong Zhenren realizes the danger and adopts a defensive strategy, Shuangjing Mountain is even more crowded with experts.</p><p>Their goal is to remove Zuyuan's fangs!</p><p>As long as Zuyuan can be driven back from Shuangjing Mountain, they can pursue relentlessly, seizing the opportunity to tear a hole in Zuyuan's formation.</p><p>In addition to Qin Sang and Qing Jun, Zhen Daochang specially arranged for the Yin Shan Guan City Lord, Jing Lin, Si Di, and other familiar Nascent Soul cultivators, along with heavy troops.</p><p>Hundreds of miles outside Shuangjing Mountain.</p><p>There's a peak here, an outpost of Zuyuan.</p><p>The wind and snow are fierce.</p><p>The mountain is covered in snow, with howling winds, seemingly normal.</p><p>However, unknown to most, there is a small and extremely hidden spirit array within the mountain, complete with ice houses and watchtowers, guarded by sentries.</p><p>Strangely, the watchtower has not only cultivators but also an eye the size of a human head.</p><p>The eye floats in mid-air, spinning around wildly, very peculiar.</p><p>Around the eye, the guards are serious and dare not relax in the slightest.</p><p>Suddenly, a subtle fluctuation appears in the void.</p><p>Before the guards notice anything unusual, the eye is extremely alert, its pupil abruptly turning to stare at the direction of the fluctuation, simultaneously emitting a sharp shriek.</p><p>“Not good! The enemy is attacking!”</p><p>The guards were startled.</p><p>They reacted swiftly.  The moment the eye moved, they simultaneously activated a spirit talisman, slapping it onto the surface, and without looking back, they dashed down from the watchtower.</p><p>The eye's pupil suddenly constricts, radiating a blinding light.</p><p>Just as a white beam is about to shoot out, cracks suddenly appear in the void. A loud “boom” echoes as the void shatters completely.</p><p>Snowflakes and howling wind mixed with fragments of the void, forming a chaotic torrent, crashing heavily into the watchtower.  Faintly, several strange lights flashed past.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The entire spirit array space, including the buildings, the eye on the watchtower, couldn't withstand it even for a moment and exploded, leveled to the ground, with a few faint screams.</p><p>The wind and snow continue.</p><p>The next moment, three figures appeared in the void, looking down at the scene of devastation below.</p><p>“I didn't expect Daoist Friend Qin to possess such profound attainments in formations and restrictions, easily identifying the weaknesses of the protective spirit array here!”</p><p>A cultivator with a dignified, square face, stroked his beard, repeatedly praising the person beside him.</p><p>This person is the Yin Shan Guan City Lord.</p><p>The other two are Qin Sang and Jing Lin.</p><p>“Daoist friend is exaggerating,” Qin Sang's expression was calm,  “The spirit array here isn’t any top-tier formation. Its purpose is only to buy some time when attacked, allowing the watchtower to scout the approaching enemy. It's not difficult to deal with.”</p><p>Senior Sister Qing Jun opened the Yuan Shen Gate's collection to him, allowing him to view it.</p><p>Qin Sang's understanding of formations has vastly improved. At least, with the Tian Mu Die’s help, his ability to break formations is far beyond the reach of other cultivators at the same level.</p><p>The three of them joined forces, instantly breaking the spirit array and destroying everything here. The eye probably only saw a chaotic mess.</p><p>Jing Lin dashed to the ground, clearing away the rubble, and discovered a damaged small teleportation array. The guards had no time to activate it before they died.</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised, “Zuyuan is really willing to spend resources. Even a mere outpost has a teleportation array.”</p><p>“Zuyuan places great importance on Shuangjing Mountain, no less than the two large camps before Shiqu Mountain and Wangdong City. They’ve long since fortified it like an iron bucket.”</p><p>Jing Lin looked around, found no useful information, erased the traces, took out a sword talisman, and transmitted the news back to the main army.</p><p>Then, the three continued their advance, eliminating the remaining outposts.</p><p>After the first outpost fell, the enemy forces on Double Mirror Mountain noticed something was amiss.</p><p>In the main hall of the camp, there was a smaller model of Double Mirror Mountain, similar to the one in Cang Hong's tent.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators gathered, watching helplessly as outpost after outpost went dark. The speed was alarming.</p><p>Their expressions were grave.  The destruction of the outposts was bad enough, but even worse, none had managed to send a message back. They hadn't even seen a trace of the enemy, and there were no survivors.</p><p>"Order everyone, including the forward camps, to withdraw to Double Mirror Mountain.  No unnecessary sacrifices,"</p><p>A purple-robed female cultivator, surrounded by others, issued the order without hesitation.  She was clearly a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>Someone went to carry out the order.</p><p>Someone else said gravely, "Only a few in the Two Realms Alliance are capable of this. It's very likely Zhen Yi or Tong You themselves.  Just as Elder Cang Hong predicted, the Two Realms Alliance has launched a counterattack."</p><p>Another chimed in, looking out at the hall, his brow furrowed. "Don't forget the two who gravely injured Elder Tian Zheng and Elder Ye at Blood Lake. Elder Ye witnessed it himself—the one disguised as the demon king is also skilled at breaking formations.  Is the enemy determined to capture Double Mirror Mountain? We haven't heard from the other camps yet.  We don't know who's coming, or how many."</p><p>The purple-robed cultivator's expression was resolute. "No need to overthink it. Daoist Cangheng has made his plans. We are to defend Double Mirror Mountain. Whoever comes, they won't take it quickly!  Everyone, activate the main formation immediately and deploy the幽晶 towers on North Mountain!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and the others attacked another outpost, only to find it deserted.</p><p>The same was true for several more.</p><p>The three realized the enemy had retreated to Double Mirror Mountain, but they continued diligently to eliminate the remaining outposts.</p><p>"This is Double Mirror Mountain,"</p><p>Jing Lin pointed to a magnificent white mountain in the distance, his expression complex.  There used to be a market town on Double Mirror Mountain. Before his Nascent Soul breakthrough, he had cultivated here for decades, experiencing both joy and sorrow. Now, everything had changed, and it was in enemy hands.</p><p>"Indeed, a formidable position, second only to the two great staircases!"</p><p>After discussing, Qin Sang and his companions decided against a reckless advance. There was an enemy camp ahead that wouldn't be easily taken, so they waited for the main force.</p><p>Not long after, Qing Jun arrived with the main army. The great battle was about to begin!</p>
