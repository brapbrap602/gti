<h1>Chapter 1857: The Unexpected</h1><p>Golden light radiating from the Vajra Bodhi Tree filled the entire bubble space. Holding it felt like grasping a golden sphere. Within the golden light, a faint blue shimmer fluctuated – the radiance of a restrictive ward.</p><p>Qin Sang was currently multitasking, driving his escape technique, comprehending the ward, and guarding against the spirit tree suddenly vanishing into nothingness.  Fortunately, he had the Skyeye Butterfly's assistance. Its Skyeye Divine Ability could capture minute changes, giving him the courage to fly towards the valley's exit. But to prevent sudden anomalies, he conserved his strength while escaping, lest all his efforts be in vain.</p><p>“This ward is strong…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, glancing back.  The oppressive aura followed him like a shadow. For now, it couldn't catch up, but Qin Sang couldn't shake off its lock either.  Moreover, his pursuer was a Demon King, and no one knew what other abilities it possessed.</p><p>In this situation, there was simply not enough time to fully decipher the ward.  After briefly analyzing its structure, he would have to forcefully break it, quickly leaving this dangerous place, hoping not to damage the spirit tree in the process.</p><p>Flying upwards for a while, Qin Sang discovered that although the blue ward showed signs of weakening, it was much slower than anticipated.  As expected, the ward's changes weren't solely related to location.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang didn't dare take the bubble directly out of the valley. He had an inexplicable feeling. While the blue ward hadn't weakened significantly, the golden light within the bubble seemed to be undergoing some sort of transformation.  He wasn't sure if this transformation was towards the ethereal, nor did he dare gamble. His sense of urgency intensified.</p><p>Behind Qin Sang, in a place invisible to the naked eye, the blue light waves were much dimmer than elsewhere.</p><p>‘Splash… splash…’</p><p>A faint sound of water ripples approached from afar. Dark, ethereal waves surged forward. Within the spreading black tide, a dark figure was vaguely visible – a fish-headed, serpent-bodied creature.</p><p>The black fish had a massive body, yet moved with unusual agility and speed.</p><p>The Black Fish Manifestation swayed its long tail within the black tide, its gaze deep and fixed on the constantly escaping streak of lightning ahead.</p><p>With each flick of its serpentine tail, a wave surged within the ethereal ripples, propelling its body forward a considerable distance.</p><p>…</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had no time to consider how to deal with the powerful enemy behind him. His mind was immersed in the ward on the bubble's surface.</p><p>His hard work paid off.  He finally managed to identify several key energy channels.  Through these main channels, he could discern the ward’s pattern and use it to break the restriction.</p><p>Inside the bubble, the golden light receded like a tide, significantly less dazzling than before. It confirmed his earlier suspicion – the bubble space was indeed undergoing an unknown change.  The oppressive aura behind him drew closer. He couldn't wait any longer!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze merged with the Skyeye Divine Ability. Under his scrutiny, faint divine light seemed to flow across the bubble's surface.</p><p>Gradually, a resolute look flashed across Qin Sang’s face. He suddenly raised his other hand, placing it on the bubble's surface.</p><p>His palms half-closed, the bubble nestled between them.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's hands transformed into a pure, glassy substance, radiating Buddhist light, devoid of any fleshly aura.</p><p>As the Buddhist light enveloped the bubble, the golden light within remained unchanged, but the blue light on the surface suddenly intensified, momentarily overpowering the golden glow.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang's arms vibrated violently.  His palms felt a powerful recoil.  He forced his hands together with all his might, firmly suppressing the suddenly erupting blue light.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!…’</p><p>The bubble trembled continuously. Qin Sang's hands clamped around it like iron hoops, withstanding the impact.</p><p>The commotion grew louder and louder.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang could suppress it, but gradually, he lost control.  Intense blue light burst from the gaps between his hands, dyeing Qin Sang and the surrounding light waves azure.</p><p>Simultaneously, an invisible wave emanated along with the blue light, creating a tremendous disturbance in the surroundings.</p><p>Behind, the ethereal waves paused.  The Black Fish Manifestation raised its upper body, gazing into the distance.  Its eyes flashed brightly, and it fiercely whipped its tail, stirring up a towering black tide.</p><p>It was the crucial moment for breaking the ward. Qin Sang no longer cared about anything else.  Man and butterfly became one, focusing all their power on breaking the restriction!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The bubble suddenly slipped from his grasp.  The blue light, now completely unrestrained, became visible for hundreds of miles, even within the chaotic light waves of the valley.</p><p>At the same time, a sword light flashed at Qin Sang's brow.</p><p>In an instant, the Cloud Wanderer Sword appeared above the bubble, aimed at its center, and slashed down!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Accompanied by a cracking sound, the blue light blazed, blindingly bright.  Qin Sang involuntarily narrowed his eyes, a hint of joy flashing within them.</p><p>The blue light's eruption was extremely brief, rapidly receding.  Then, a burst of golden light erupted from the center of the blue.</p><p>The shadows of swirling leaves were faintly visible.</p><p>"Success!"</p><p>Overjoyed, Qin Sang rushed towards the golden light without hesitation, his figure disappearing within the dazzling intermingling of blue and gold.</p><p>A moment later, a startled, furious voice rang out.</p><p>“How is this possible!”</p><p>Entering the golden light, Qin Sang witnessed a scene vastly different from what he had imagined, and entirely unlike the other bubbles.</p><p>The bubbles he had previously opened, as long as they hadn't begun to dissipate, would release their contents into reality. Qin Sang would take the valuable items, leaving the rest to be shattered by the light waves.</p><p>The Vajra Bodhi Tree didn't appear in reality, or perhaps it did, but for a duration so fleeting that even with Qin Sang's cultivation, it felt instantaneous.</p><p>Within the dense golden light, beneath the tree's crown, there seemed to be a black hole.  Qin Sang saw the tree being swallowed by it. An unsettling, eerie power emanated from the black hole, devouring the tree trunk in an instant.  The black hole rapidly closed, leaving only a small portion of the crown visible.</p><p>The spirit tree trembled violently, its branches thrashing as if buffeted by a fierce wind.  The Vajra Fruit he had seen earlier swayed wildly, its surface shimmering erratically.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The fruit ripened and fell.</p><p>The Vajra Fruit dropped, accompanied by another hidden beneath the leaves.  They transformed into two points of golden light, flitting erratically.</p><p>The black hole was about to vanish with the spirit tree.</p><p>In this situation, Qin Sang had no time to think. He fully activated the Great Vajra Wheel Seal and, disregarding the danger, reached towards the black hole. A twisting pain shot through his right hand. At the very last moment, he retracted his hand!</p><p>The next moment, the black hole turned into golden specks and vanished before his eyes. The golden light in the void gradually dissipated.</p><p>The spirit tree disappeared. The bubble was gone, as if it had never existed.  Everything returned to normal.</p><p>Only the sensation in his palm was real – slightly cool, rather heavy.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his hand.  Two Vajra Fruits lay there, salvaged from the disappearing tree.</p><p>The Vajra Fruits were oval-shaped, the size of a thumb, their surfaces covered in strange patterns, exuding an extraordinary aura.</p><p>“Two…”</p><p>The astonishment in Qin Sang's eyes lingered.  The disparity was too great. He had thought he'd secured the entire spirit tree, but in the end, he only obtained two Vajra Fruits.</p><p>Why had this happened?</p><p>He stared at the spot where the spirit tree had been swallowed, unable to comprehend what had occurred in that final moment.</p><p>While breaking the ward, Qin Sang had been extremely cautious.  His sword strike had been meticulously planned.</p><p>There was nothing unusual about the process, except for the object within the bubble.</p><p>“Could it be because the place where the Vajra Bodhi Tree grew was different?”</p><p>It was possible that the Vajra Bodhi Tree, the source of the blue light sea's unrest, possessed some unique divine property.</p><p>Where had the Vajra Bodhi Tree been taken?</p><p>Had it transformed into another bubble, continuing to drift? Or did the tree itself bear an ancient ward that had sent it back to where it belonged?</p><p>Compared to the countless bubbles within the valley, Qin Sang had encountered very few. He lacked sufficient evidence and couldn't figure it out no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>More troubling was that he probably couldn't continue searching here, at least not now.</p><p>All things considered, his gains weren't insignificant.  He had expected to be satisfied with three to five Vajra Fruits. Two were better than none.</p><p>Furthermore, his battle with Marquis Dingxiang, though he hadn't slain him, had yielded remarkable results, greatly benefiting his comprehension of cultivation techniques.</p><p>Unlike his previous battle with Xiahou, he had faced Marquis Dingxiang at his peak. Before breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage, he likely wouldn't need to deliberately seek out opponents anymore.</p><p>However, thinking about his current predicament, Qin Sang couldn't be happy no matter what.  He had risked being pursued by a Demon King and only obtained two Vajra Fruits. Was it worth it?</p><p>“Heh, you’re quite quick…”</p><p>A sinister chuckle faintly echoed.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids twitched.  A black tide surged towards him from behind, its momentum astonishing.</p><p>While he was breaking the ward, Demon King Lingyou had caught up.</p><p>The Black Fish Manifestation's gaze swept over Qin Sang's surroundings, finding nothing but the lingering golden light.</p><p>He must have taken the tree and its fruit!</p><p>Qin Sang felt two cold gazes lock onto him, his back stiffening.  He smiled wryly, thinking: If I said I only got two Vajra Fruits and offered him one, would this old demon believe me?</p><p>He knew without thinking that such words wouldn't fool anyone.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>With a rapid flap of his phoenix wings, Qin Sang transformed into a streak of lightning and fled without a word, not wasting his breath.</p><p>He held nothing back, displaying his peak escape technique before Demon King Lingyou.</p><p>On the bright side, Demon King Lingyou mistakenly believed he had taken all the Vajra Fruits. Only Qin Sang knew the tree was still here, and he could return later to search for it, another opportunity.</p><p>Of course, that was assuming he survived this crisis.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The lightning tore through the light waves, its thunder echoing far and wide.</p><p>The Black Fish Manifestation revealed a human-like sneer. Its serpentine tail momentarily transformed into a dragon's tail, slamming against the surface. The ethereal waves behind it rose high, forming a cliff-like tsunami.</p><p>The thousand-foot-high wave crashed into the Black Fish Manifestation with tremendous force.</p><p>Faint light shimmered across the scales on the Black Fish Manifestation's surface.  The giant wave couldn't harm it, instead clinging to its body and propelling it forward at extreme speed.</p><p>At this moment, the speed Demon King Lingyou unleashed shocked Qin Sang to the core. A Demon King's divine abilities were truly formidable!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>“Crash!”</p><p>…</p><p>Lightning and tsunami, one after the other, chased towards the valley's exit.</p><p>Meanwhile, Marquis Dingxiang and Marquis Yuan had found the other three Demon Marquises. The five joined forces.</p><p>Marquis Dingxiang consumed medicinal pills, forcibly suppressing his injuries, and led the four Demon Marquises back to where they had encountered Qin Sang.</p><p>The place was long deserted. After searching, the five demons found the mark left by Demon King Lingyou, but after following it for a while, the mark disappeared.</p><p>“His Majesty must be fully focused on pursuing that scoundrel, unable to be distracted,” Marquis Yuan speculated.</p><p>“That fellow is so powerful, and his escape technique is so strong. We were already so far behind, even with the mark, we can't catch him."</p><p>Another Demon Marquis spoke, looking at Marquis Dingxiang, “Among us, only you have the ability to assist His Majesty, but you are seriously injured…”</p><p>At these words, the demons fell silent.</p><p>The other cultivators were surely searching for the Divine Court.  It would be difficult to summon help now.</p><p>“Why the long faces? That scoundrel is unknown.  Regardless of his identity, he can't be a Grand Patriarch or a Demon King.  No matter how capable he is, he can't overturn the heavens! If he has the Vajra Fruit, he'll most likely flee outwards. We'll intercept him outside!”</p><p>Marquis Dingxiang snorted coldly and soared into the sky.</p><p>Hearing they were leaving, the other Demon Marquises felt reluctant. Though they hadn't obtained any Vajra Fruit, they had found many treasures during their search.</p><p>Within the Ritual Grounds, such untouched treasure troves were extremely rare. If they missed this opportunity, the treasures would vanish into nothingness, and they'd never have another chance.</p><p>Marquis Dingxiang held considerable authority.  The demons didn't dare disobey his command, and lured by the Vajra Fruit, they followed.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang and Demon King Lingyou had flown out of the valley, rising directly towards the sea's surface.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly kept watch on Demon King Lingyou's movements for Qin Sang.</p><p>Whether Demon King Lingyou had reached his limit or had some other scheme, his speed didn't increase further, remaining closely behind Qin Sang.</p><p>“Perhaps, Demon King Lingyou intends to exhaust my strength.”</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang’s mind.  This was precisely what he wanted to see.  Even if he couldn't shake off Demon King Lingyou, as long as he could reach the Jungle Domain, Qin Sang was confident he could face the Demon King!</p><p>He didn't harbor any ambitions of slaying the Demon King, but instead planned to rely on the Spirit Wood Body's regenerative abilities to find a way to escape.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Somewhere in the light sea, blue light waves suddenly surged skyward.  A streak of lightning burst through the waves.</p><p>With the surrounding scenery in full view, Qin Sang realized he wasn't far from the edge of the light sea. Recalling the layout of the surrounding illusions, he quickly plotted a course, the lightning abruptly changing direction mid-air.</p><p>Immediately after, a black tide rose from the depths of the light sea, chasing the lightning across the surface.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly heard a whistling sound behind him, feeling a cold gust of wind against his back.</p><p>“Finally lost your patience…”</p><p>Qin Sang sneered inwardly, making no attempt to dodge. He activated the Bright Mountain Armor, the True Treasure fragments converging on his back.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>A muffled sound, like an arrow piercing the water's surface, followed by a burst of ethereal light exploding behind Qin Sang. It was a black water arrow, extremely powerful, but it failed to injure him.</p><p>Demon King Lingyou's eyes flickered, studying the armor on Qin Sang for a long moment. He recalled Qin Sang's earlier solo fight against the two Demon Marquises.  It seemed this armor not only defended against Demon Marquis attacks but also possessed some unknown mystical properties.</p><p>The water arrow seemed to be a signal.  Immediately after, a barrage of various attacks rained down.</p><p>Qin Sang blocked what he could, dodged the rest, continuing to flee without looking back.</p><p>Entangled in this pursuit, he finally broke through the edge of the light sea, entering another illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted. He remembered which illusions were dangerous and which were safe.  Several ideas already formed in his mind.</p><p>Demon King Lingyou must be forcibly enhancing his speed with some secret technique.  With the right timing, it might not be impossible to shake him off!</p><p>Continuously strategizing, Qin Sang led Demon King Lingyou through a dozen illusions.</p><p>The commotion of their chase was impossible to conceal.  Chaos erupted wherever they passed.</p><p>…</p><p>At this moment, Patriarch Zuo, who was in the midst of meditative recovery, frowned deeply.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
