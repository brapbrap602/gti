<h1>Chapter 2216: The Trial</h1><p>The assembled powerful cultivators jointly sent the treasure into the heart lake.</p><p>Hong Tian watched the direction the treasure flew, and after a short while, a momentary daze flickered in his eyes.  Thankfully, he quickly regained his composure.</p><p>"Amazing!"</p><p>A female cultivator exclaimed.</p><p>So many people acting together, stirring the mysterious power within the heart lake, almost all were nearly pulled in, unable to extricate themselves.</p><p>"No wonder the old-timers are all stuck in there!"</p><p>Someone sighed, "We need to be more cautious later. Now it's up to the younger generation!"</p><p>"Brother Mu, have you chosen your people?" Hong Tian interjected.</p><p>"I'll tell you if you promise not to attack my people."</p><p>The person loudly replied, while secretly transmitting a voice, "I hear you've chosen a human cultivator, quite strong. However, he and your brother are likely decoys, right?  I can guess who's hidden in the shadows. Let's make a pact; we both benefit. How about it?"</p><p>Hong Tian's expression changed slightly. He said coldly, "Brother Mu seems to know me well? But I, Hong Tian, always act openly and honestly, without any hidden agents. If Brother Mu wants to target me, feel free to try."</p><p>"So, I was wrong? Heh heh.  Hong Tian, you misunderstand.  Without benefits, why would I target you? I'm genuinely being helpful. Let's just wait and see…"</p><p>The person's laughter gradually faded.</p><p>Hong Tian snorted, his eyes flashing, and he did not engage in further verbal sparring.</p><p>…</p><p>The earth roared with a deafening boom.</p><p>After the roar, the mountain stopped growing. Stone walls lined the mountain, rows and rows of stone platforms, seemingly inviting everyone to climb.</p><p>Everyone was very cautious and didn't act rashly. After observing for a while, they found the mountain unusually quiet, with no sign of beasts or magical barriers.</p><p>With no visible danger, was it truly safe?  They had to try it themselves to know!</p><p>Among the ancestral disciples, someone couldn't wait, shooting a streak of light toward the mountain.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The Avian Prince suddenly intervened, a black feather appearing in the void, striking the streak of light.</p><p>A sudden gust of wind arose, and a muffled groan came from within the light as it flew back, revealing a young man who, while unharmed, was rather disheveled, his robes wrinkled.</p><p>The young man glared at the Avian Prince, but knowing the difference in their strength, he didn't dare to fight back.</p><p>"Everyone!"</p><p>The Avian Prince lightly flapped his wings, flying between the two factions, "The number of stone platforms on the mountain can roughly accommodate us all, but the positions have high and low distinctions. Who goes where, and who stands at the peak?  Shouldn't we decide a procedure beforehand?"</p><p>Scoffs arose from the crowd. "What's the difficulty? It's whoever's strongest, whoever can subdue everyone, takes the summit!"</p><p>"Are you all of the same mind?"</p><p>The Mermaid Queen, moving her tail gracefully as if in water, swam forward, standing beside the Avian Prince with a charming smile. "With so many fighting chaotically, with discordant hearts, how long will it take to determine a victor? Even if someone reaches a platform, with continuous challenges, who can maintain their position?"</p><p>"You seem to be implying something?"</p><p>A man in white robes stepped forward from among the ancestral disciples. He was handsome, with striking eyebrows, and his colorful long hair almost reached the ground.</p><p>He seemed to hold considerable status among the crowd; as he moved forward, others made way, implicitly acknowledging his leading position.</p><p>The Avian Prince and the Mermaid Queen both focused on the white-robed man. This was the person they were looking for! The current situation feared a fractured opposition, incapable of negotiation; a leader made things easier.</p><p>"May I ask your name, sir?" The Avian Prince bowed deeply and asked.</p><p>"Xi Rui, of the Shengyu Clan," the white-robed man replied with a bow.</p><p>The Avian Prince's expression shifted slightly. Seeing the man's colorful hair, he guessed his clan.  The Shengyu Clan was one of the Avian's tributary clans, but this custom was limited to Mist Sea; the other party wouldn't recognize his status now, and his strength might not be inferior.</p><p>"Brother Xi," the Avian Prince nodded, changing his tone, "Don't think we're ignorant. We not only need to reach the stone platforms but also refine them to become their masters.  Even if you gain the upper hand, if we relentlessly harass you, what will you do?"</p><p>Upon hearing this, many faces changed drastically.</p><p>Xi Rui remained calm, asking, "What do you two propose?"</p><p>"Each person chooses a platform, no interference from outsiders, the winner becomes the master, and no one can challenge them again!" The Avian Prince already had a plan.</p><p>“No regrets once the move is made!” added the Mermaid Queen.</p><p>“And what of the loser?” Xi Rui pressed.</p><p>The Avian Prince replied, “The mountain’s midpoint is the boundary. Losers are relegated below it and may not cross.”</p><p>The powerful Saints hadn't explained the reason, but it was clear: the higher the position, the greater the reward.</p><p>Below the midpoint, the value plummeted, making the competition less fierce. Once the upper half was decided, the rest was simple; just repeat the process as needed.</p><p>Xi Rui frowned.  "No regrets" meant each participant had only one choice. Even the strongest could be unlucky and face a superior opponent.</p><p>Closer to the summit, competition would intensify. Choosing a position required careful consideration of one's strength. If they refused, as the Avian Prince said, relentless harassment would prevent them from peacefully absorbing the stone platforms.</p><p>Others only sought to absorb the stone platforms and gain higher positions, but Xi Rui knew more.</p><p>His ancestor held a special status,  a master whose cultivation reached the Ancestor Realm!</p><p>Ancestor Realm cultivators of the Otherkin were comparable to the Human's Mahayana-stage cultivators, standing at the apex of the vast world, their knowledge nearly limitless.</p><p>The Otherkin likely had few Ancestor Realm cultivators.</p><p>This event involved not only their ancestors but also the shadow of Ancestor Realm masters!</p><p>Before departure, his ancestor had enlightened him.  Absorbing a stone platform before the final moment would bring protection, not guaranteeing victory, but ensuring safer circumstances afterward. The higher the position, the stronger the protection.</p><p>The ancestor hadn't specified the nature of this protection, and Xi Rui didn't dare ask. Few in the assembly likely knew this secret, and fewer still would reveal it.</p><p>Initially, everyone thought the ranking simply determined the rewards. But if it became a matter of life and death, the struggle would be relentless.</p><p>Xi Rui didn't immediately agree, instead consulting his companions.</p><p>Soon he returned:  "Agreed! We accept the proposal. Any who renege will face the wrath of the group!"</p><p>The agreement made, someone chuckled, "If I choose a midpoint position, surely no one will dispute it?"</p><p>Before the words left his mouth, an ancestor's disciple leaped forward, pointing to a midpoint platform and flying towards the sacred mountain.</p><p>The Avian Prince and Mermaid Queen's eyes narrowed, glancing at their followers.</p><p>The cultivators exchanged glances; no one dared challenge him.</p><p>The chosen platform was at the very bottom of the first wave of competition.  Ambitious individuals with strength would target higher positions.</p><p>Those backed by powerful forces, like the Avian Prince, would aim for the summit; their rivals would do the same. To deter opponents, they’d have their subordinates choose the same platform, easing pressure on other positions.</p><p>This individual was clever, understanding this; the midpoint offered minimal competition, at least higher than the first wave's losers.</p><p>In plain sight, he reached the platform, suddenly his body sagged, nearly falling.  </p><p>Quickly recovering, he ascended against the unseen pressure; its intensity growing with altitude.  The onlookers noted this obstacle for the coming struggle.</p><p>Otherwise, there seemed no danger.  He reached the platform safely, surveyed his surroundings, and smiled.</p><p>Seeing his easy success, others were stirred.</p><p>"I want the one beside him!"</p><p>Two more rushed forward.</p><p>Midpoint platforms were limited; delay meant missing out. Their ancestors didn't demand the summit; the midpoint sufficed.</p><p>As others prepared to move, a whistling sound echoed from above.</p><p>Heads turned upward; meteors were falling.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Three fiery lights pierced the sky, striking the sacred mountain.</p><p>To everyone's surprise, they landed on the platforms the three cultivators had just claimed!</p><p>Those who'd been wavering hesitated, watching.</p><p>The cultivator on the platform felt a sense of foreboding as the meteors approached.</p><p>Then, the "meteors" were revealed: three treasures, blazing within the fiery light.</p><p>A booming, ethereal voice echoed from the heavens, “Hear ye, those participating in the Sacred Land trials! Only those who stand upon the platform shall claim the treasures…”  A ripple of unrest spread through the crowd. The voice, imbued with mystical power, clearly belonged to a powerful being, a Saint-level cultivator.</p><p>The disciples of the various elders exchanged uneasy glances. Did the announcement include them?</p><p>“A Skywind Tree!”</p><p>Qin Sang heard a gasp of delight and turned to see a female cultivator.  Her gaze was fixed on one of the falling meteors, which enclosed a small tree.</p><p>The tree was diminutive, like an ordinary shrub, with sparse branches, bare of leaves, and tangled, dry roots, appearing withered. Yet, those with keen eyes could discern a small whirlwind at the tip of each branch, perpetually swirling, a telltale sign of the Skywind Tree, a rare and valuable spiritual plant.</p><p>This cultivator, having searched for the Skywind Tree for years, her joy uncontainable, exclaimed to another woman beside her, "My apologies, Sister Mi, but this Skywind Tree is crucial to me. I cannot miss it!"</p><p>With those words, she launched herself towards the mountain.</p><p>The cultivator already on the mountaintop's face darkened. The Skywind Tree had landed precisely where he was, a situation that had seemed certain until this unexpected rival appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others fell silent, thoughtful.</p><p>This, they realized, was Hong Tian’s and the others’ plan—a tempting lure.  If everyone had previously tried to avoid offending the elders, what now, confronted with such treasures?</p><p>Probably most would follow the female cultivator's example. The treasures were right before their eyes; the elders' displeasure could be dealt with later.</p><p>Even better, Hong Tian and his cohorts had provided a perfect excuse—the Sacred Land trials themselves.</p><p>The female cultivator moved gracefully, prepared for resistance. She flew lightly to the stone platform, landing with effortless elegance under the scowling gaze of her opponent.</p><p>“I must obtain this Skywind Tree, my apologies!” she said politely, giving a graceful bow. “Esteemed cultivator, you are no match for me. Please leave.”</p><p>The disparity in their cultivation was evident.</p><p>Her opponent, though reluctant, raised a jade hook, sighing, “If you can withstand my strike, I shall yield this place.”</p><p>The female cultivator nodded, spreading her sleeves before her, and replied crisply,  “Please.”</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Her opponent threw the jade hook. It struck the sleeves with a *thump*, embedding itself deep within.  Two spiritual lights clashed, seemingly calm yet fraught with danger.</p><p>After a moment, seeing the jade hook unable to pierce the sleeves, the cultivator sighed and retracted it. “I yield.”</p><p>A true sportsman, he flew down the mountain, inwardly bitter.  He’d hoped for a lucky find, but had instead suffered a loss.</p><p>Once her opponent was gone, the female cultivator looked outward, pleased to see no one else approaching.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Skywind Tree descended before her. As she reached out to claim it, her face paled, and she retreated several feet.  Ripples of fire flared around the tree, containing terrifying force, nearly sending her flying.</p><p>Quickly understanding, she sat cross-legged, focusing her mind on the stone platform beneath her, refining it.</p><p>Everyone watched her intently.</p><p>Soon, she opened her eyes, surprised to find the stone platform transformed into jade, radiant and translucent.</p><p>Without hesitation, she formed a large hand and eagerly reached for the Skywind Tree.</p><p>The barrier around the tree vanished.  Her hand easily passed through the flames, seizing the tree and bringing it before her.</p><p>The female cultivator gazed at the spiritual tree, her face alight with joy.  Though she could have competed for higher ranked treasures, obtaining the Skywind Tree was more valuable than anything else.</p><p>The female cultivator was the first big winner!</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes gleamed. He understood the trial's rules, the list of treasures flashing through his mind. The trials and the ranking on the mountain were interconnected; obtaining the most precious treasures would not be easy.</p>
