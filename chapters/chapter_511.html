<h1>Chapter 504: Worldly Affairs</h1><p>The shopkeeper frantically dug through the snow with a charcoal shovel.</p><p>Under the snow, there was indeed a frozen corpse.</p><p>“Quick… quickly report this to the authorities…”</p><p>With a body found in front of his shop, the shopkeeper was terrified and distraught.</p><p>The corpse was lying face down, its arm still outstretched as if reaching forward, fingers clinging desperately to the ground.  He had struggled to crawl forward, desperately seeking help, but had collapsed from exhaustion just a few steps from the bun shop, freezing to death.</p><p>Those few steps were like a chasm.</p><p>The shopkeeper, regaining his composure, bravely knelt down, brushed away the ice and snow from the body, revealing a beggar's attire. He sighed softly, “It's Old Qi.  I wondered why I hadn't seen him this morning…”</p><p>Qin Sang slipped away from the onlookers.</p><p>…</p><p>The capital of Gu Yuan.</p><p>The Imperial Palace.</p><p>Even in the snowy night, the Emperor's chambers were brightly lit, radiating warmth.</p><p>“Get out!”</p><p>A furious shout ripped through the night's stillness.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The serving girl’s tray and the bowl of soup it held were flung from the imperial bed by the Gu Yuan Emperor.</p><p>The medicine spilled across the floor, its pungent smell filling the room. The serving girl fell, covered in the dark medicine, her face pale as she trembled on the ground.</p><p>“Your servant is at fault!”</p><p>“Your Majesty, please calm down!”</p><p>…</p><p>In an instant, a crowd knelt before him.</p><p>On the imperial bed, the Gu Yuan Emperor threw off his light covers, attempting to get up.  His frail body, however, couldn’t support him; he swayed, only narrowly avoided falling thanks to a quick-thinking servant girl.</p><p>He pushed the servant girl aside, trying several times to rise, but to no avail.</p><p>His hair disheveled, the Gu Yuan Emperor looked utterly distraught.  He lay on the bed, behaving wildly, pointing at a richly dressed young man. He screamed, his voice hoarse with desperation:</p><p>“Go… go to Xianglong Mountain and summon the immortal! As long as… as long as he cures my illness, grants me longevity, I will cede half my kingdom and share my wealth with him…”</p><p>The young man in fine clothes was the crown prince of Gu Yuan.</p><p>The prince crawled to the bedside and said softly, “Father, please don’t worry. I will go to Xianglong Mountain to beseech the immortal. If he does not appear, I will kneel there until he does, and I will ensure he cures your illness…”</p><p>“Longevity! I want longevity!”</p><p>The Gu Yuan Emperor pounded the bed frame, his eyes bloodshot, glaring at the young man with a terrifying expression.</p><p>Shaohua Mountain’s rule was strict, forbidding cultivators from interfering in mortal affairs.  And the Gu Yuan kingdom, small and insignificant, held no sway with Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>The prince, unable to disobey, tried to soothe him, “Yes, yes… I will certainly implore the immortal for the secret to longevity…”</p><p>“Go quickly!”</p><p>The Emperor finally calmed down temporarily.</p><p>The prince and the officials left the Emperor's chambers.</p><p>With the Emperor gravely ill and the prince overseeing the government, he didn’t immediately depart for Shaohua Mountain. Instead, he returned to his study, dismissed his attendants, and sat alone on his throne, brooding silently.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a creak at the door.</p><p>The wind stirred the candlelight.</p><p>A general in armor slipped inside, saying urgently, “Your Highness, are you truly going to heed the Emperor’s command and offer half the kingdom to this so-called immortal?”</p><p>The prince coldly replied, “Uncle, are you suggesting I disobey the Emperor and become a disloyal and unfilial son?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare!”</p><p>The general strode forward, his large frame blocking the candlelight and casting the prince’s face in shadow.</p><p>“The late Emperor ruled with filial piety, but not foolish obedience. I have just questioned the imperial physicians. The Emperor’s illness is terminal, he’s lost his mind. The physicians say it’s a kind of hysterical illness. It so happens that I have a renowned physician as a guest at my residence, skilled in medicinal wine. He can concoct a colorless, tasteless wine to cure this illness…”</p><p>The general’s voice grew softer.</p><p>After a long silence, the prince slowly closed his eyes and nodded slightly, “Go.”</p><p>…</p><p>Late at night.</p><p>The Gu Yuan Emperor’s chambers.</p><p>An old eunuch hurried in, his face etched with terror and confusion.  He stumbled over the threshold, falling to the ground.</p><p>“Your Majesty!”</p><p>“Your Majesty, wake up!”</p><p>“Your Majesty, wake up!”</p><p>The eunuch crawled to the imperial bed, shaking the sleeping Emperor violently.</p><p>The Gu Yuan Emperor awoke, his eyes still unfocused.</p><p>The old eunuch cried out, “Your Majesty, beware! The Crown Prince…”</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp sword pierced the old eunuch's throat.  The blood-soaked tip startled the King of Gu Yuan, jolting him fully awake. He saw that the assassin was his own son, the Crown Prince!</p><p>All traces of the Prince's former obedience vanished, replaced by a cold indifference.</p><p>“Traitor!”</p><p>The King roared in fury.</p><p>The Prince tossed the bloody sword to the ground, glanced at the general beside him, and strode out of the palace without looking back.</p><p>The general clamped a hand over the King's mouth and forced a cup of poisoned wine down his throat.</p><p>The poison took effect.</p><p>As death approached, the King's eyes glazed over, but his last words echoed his obsession.</p><p>“Longevity… I crave longevity…”</p><p>…</p><p>Dragon Soaring Mountain.</p><p>Villagers lived in the fairy-blessed city at the foot of the mountain, while those seeking immortality lived in secluded huts in the mountains.</p><p>Among the trees was a drafty straw hut.</p><p>‘Knock, knock, knock…’</p><p>“Brother Zuo… Brother Zuo, are you awake…?”</p><p>A dishevelled man knocked, calling out, but received no answer.</p><p>He banged several times harder, to no avail, then hurried away.</p><p>Moments later, he returned with helpers, and together they forced the wooden door open.</p><p>Inside, a thin, frail young man sat cross-legged on a straw bed, his head slumped, seemingly lifeless.</p><p>“Brother Zuo is dead!”</p><p>the man exclaimed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a surprising scene unfolded.</p><p>His friends, far from showing sorrow, were inexplicably overjoyed, surrounding the young man.</p><p>One said, “Brother Zuo has ascended!”</p><p>Another said, “Brother Zuo lived simply, communed with the immortals, and finally achieved enlightenment.”</p><p>One, filled with envy, said, “Brother Zuo's devotion was unwavering, heaven itself bore witness.  He must have moved Heaven and Earth, been taken by the immortals, ascended to paradise, and achieved immortality.”</p><p>…</p><p>Such was the chaos.</p><p>Follow WeChat Official Account: Book Friends’ Camp.

Returning to Hui Long Temple, after a moment’s thought, she suddenly dispelled the fog array over Dragon Soaring Mountain and vanished.</p><p>The thick fog, which had shrouded the mountain for countless years, suddenly dissipated. This unprecedented phenomenon sent the immortal seekers into a frenzy.</p><p>“The fog has lifted!”</p><p>“An immortal is opening his mountain to accept disciples!”</p><p>“Hurry up the mountain…”</p><p>Hearing the shouts from outside the hut, the people inside exchanged glances and rushed out.</p><p>At that moment, the young man, whom they believed dead, suddenly raised his head, shakily stood up, ate some snow, and stumbled to the mountaintop.</p><p>But there was only an abandoned temple on the summit; no immortals.</p><p>The young man, struck by a bolt from the blue, collapsed to the ground.</p>
