<h1>Chapter 1817: The Kirin</h1><p>The cave was evidently a tomb of black bones.</p><p>Suddenly, a cracking sound echoed from within.</p><p>The sound was muffled.</p><p>Qin Sang’s fingers were pinching black powder, the remnants of a black bone he had just crushed.</p><p>The intense poison had seeped into the marrow, completely decaying the bone; not a trace of white remained.</p><p>Bone dust trickled from his fingertips.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the White Jade Elder for a long time, his eyes flickering as verses from the *Poison God Canon* raced through his mind.</p><p>This sacred text on the art of poison was exceptionally bizarre.  Most would avoid it like the plague, but Qin Sang found some inspiration within it, even conceiving the idea of trying it himself.</p><p>He didn't know when he sat down before the altar, his eyes closed, pondering deeply.  As his understanding of the *Poison God Canon* deepened, so did this idea.</p><p>The *Poison God Canon* was a complete inheritance, including fundamental cultivation methods and corresponding supernatural powers, various poison-controlling techniques, a catalogue of the world's poisons, some poison formulas, and most importantly, the secret art of poison refinement for body tempering.</p><p>The cultivation method could reach the peak of the late Nascent Soul stage, breaking through the five talismans and entering the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>It wasn't a cultivation method directly aiming for the Dao; the *Poison God Canon* lacked chapters or volumes, perhaps because its creator stopped there, unable to further refine it.</p><p>That's understandable; this cultivation method is too extreme, a path of life and death.</p><p>The *Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swords* achieves enlightenment through killing, but as the cultivator progresses, they can gradually suppress their killing intent. However, the *Poison God Canon* remains unchanged in its nature; its creator seemed very stubborn.</p><p>The creators of such cultivation methods are invariably incredibly talented but also face unimaginable dangers – one wrong step could be fatal.</p><p>Many Grand Masters are from Daoist sects. Qin Sang had numerous fellow cultivators in Jushan, and from their conversations, he could only confirm that the Yintian Palace had a Grand Master.</p><p>That the creator of the *Poison God Canon* reached the Void Refinement stage and left such a complete inheritance was remarkable, enough to be called the Poison God.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the White Jade Elder, the carved elder—could he be the creator?</p><p>If the black bones belonged to the creator's descendants, then their devout worship before their ancestor's statue would be normal.</p><p>His mind returned to the *Poison God Canon*.</p><p>He certainly intended to try the poison refinement body tempering technique; his promise to Qingdan was partly due to this technique.  Now, Qin Sang considered how to utilize the *Poison God Canon*'s fundamental cultivation methods.</p><p>According to the *Poison God Canon*, refining poison into essence, provided sufficient superior poisons, could greatly accelerate cultivation speed—this was what most intrigued Qin Sang.</p><p>Changing cultivation methods was impossible. Losing the seven killing talismans of the *Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swords* would immediately significantly reduce his cultivation speed.</p><p>If the *Poison God Canon* were a mainstream cultivation method directly leading to the Dao, it would be different.  However, forcibly pursuing the path of poison, even if temporarily beneficial, had an uncertain future; a simple assessment would reveal it to be disadvantageous.</p><p>So, could he borrow the brilliance of the *Poison God Canon* and use it for his own purposes?</p><p>The core principle of the *Poison God Canon* is to absorb intense poisons and transform them into poison essence to rapidly improve cultivation.</p><p>Through his understanding of the cultivation method, Qin Sang discovered that its foundation revolved around refining poison into essence, which essentially uses external substances to cultivate.</p><p>Qin Sang's idea was to extract only the portion of refining poison into essence, integrating it into his existing method, and using it selectively.</p><p>Qin Sang had done this before; the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique discarded the parts related to demonic bloodlines and still cultivated it forcefully.</p><p>Without cultivating the complete method, the corresponding poison-related supernatural powers could not be used, but this was unimportant; as long as it could assist Qin Sang's cultivation, it would suffice.</p><p>Moreover, the *Poison God Canon*'s cultivation method is certainly meticulously crafted for poison essence, making it the most compatible.  Without using this method, there might be incompatibility; the poison essence might not be under perfect control, becoming a hidden danger, even causing a disorder of true energy and shaking one's foundation.</p><p>The *Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swords* has one unique aspect: it originates from the path of killing, the method is formless, yet encompasses everything; therefore, Qin Sang had this idea. Even if the cultivation method could not fully control the poison essence, he could still suppress it with the power of the poison pearl.</p><p>Qin Sang dared to consider the *Poison God Canon*'s risks.</p><p>Firstly, he saw that there was a definite possibility, and the prospects were very attractive.</p><p>Secondly, he was confident in minimizing the risks.</p><p>The poison pearl could suppress the poison for him, extending the time until it manifested.</p><p>After absorbing the sacred object from the Poisonous Mountain and restoring the Bloodthirsty Spirit, Qin Sang confirmed that the more superior poisons he absorbed, the more the poison pearl would grow.  It hadn't yet reached its limit.</p><p>This showcased the immeasurable potential of the Fat Silkworm; a single separated poison pearl was this extraordinary.</p><p>With Star Refining Body and Poison Tempering Body, his physical body received dual refinement.  The rate of improvement would be astonishing.  </p><p>Even if his cultivation couldn't advance to the Void Refinement stage in time, a breakthrough in his physical body would resolve the crisis. The *Poison God Scripture* clearly stated that a breakthrough in either physical body or True Essence would avert danger.</p><p>Securing sufficient merit for the Daoist sect would allow him to request a Grand Master to perform a ritual, channeling stellar essence into his body.  This was not a concern.</p><p>Indeed, if the Poison Tempering Body technique was as miraculous as described, the requirement for stellar essence might even be lower.</p><p>The *Poison God Scripture*'s biggest limitation was the difficulty in finding enough superior poisons, something Qin Sang had in abundance.</p><p>The vast flower fields outside held countless amounts of flower dew.  Not utilizing it would be a waste.</p><p>This thought struck Qin Sang. He rose and left the cave.</p><p>“Creak…”</p><p>The stone door opened, and Qin Sang stepped out.</p><p>An unfamiliar aura immediately alerted the flower spirits. Flower cocoons rose from the flower buds.</p><p>Qin Sang then formed a strange hand seal, pressing it against his chest. His aura instantly changed.</p><p>In an instant, the flower fields returned to calm. The gently trembling cocoons stopped opening, slowly sinking back into the flower buds as the flower spirits resumed their slumber.</p><p>He had used a technique from the *Poison God Scripture* to alter his aura, masking it from the flower spirits, making him appear as one of them.  Cultivating these poisonous flowers required mastering this technique.</p><p>Seeing the technique's success, Qin Sang nodded secretly and quietly flew to a mountaintop. He circled the edge of the space, inspecting the local spirit array, without disturbing any flower spirits.</p><p>The flower fields varied in quality; the two deepest were top-grade.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived behind the two top-grade fields, gazing at the mountain peak that had previously repelled him.</p><p>The *Poison God Scripture* described this area as a “keyhole” of the flower fields, possessing a special function.</p><p>Mass cultivation of these poisonous flowers had a hidden danger.</p><p>If the flower dew wasn't collected promptly, it would blend with resentment, breeding Flower Fairies within the flower spirits.</p><p>These Flower Fairies were the evil spirits Qin Sang had slain.</p><p>The *Poison God Scripture*'s techniques could only deceive flower spirits, not Flower Fairies.</p><p>Flower Fairies were inherently infused with resentment, impossible to dispel.  Inherently cruel, they would kill any living being they encountered, posing a danger to the owner of the flower fields.</p><p>To prevent powerful Flower Fairies from arising and usurping the flower fields, a specific arrangement had been made.  If flower dew remained uncollected for a long time, it would flow to the keyhole.</p><p>Black bones of unknown age continuously flowed in, suggesting an unimaginable accumulation of flower dew in the keyhole.</p><p>Thick poison emanated from the keyhole, engulfing the mountain peak.  Qin Sang sensed the great danger from afar and didn't dare approach.</p><p>The keyhole wouldn't produce Flower Fairies and wouldn't immediately affect the flower fields. Qin Sang decided not to deal with it for now, investigating later when he was more capable.</p><p>He took out the pearl and played with it in his hand.</p><p>The pearl appeared pure, but actually contained alarming amounts of resentment, making it unsuitable for cultivation.</p><p>Refining it would yield abundant poison essence, but it would also affect his mind with resentment, leading to drastic personality changes.</p><p>Therefore, the timing of harvesting flower dew was crucial; only the purest dew should be used.  Continuous use of pure flower dew would prevent resentment's influence.</p><p>“Poison flowers, flower spirits, Flower Fairies…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured these words.</p><p>Would pure flower dew truly prevent personality changes?</p><p>Qin Sang turned to the flower fields.</p><p>The flowers swayed, so beautiful.</p><p>The *Poison God Scripture* stated that the flower's name was Flower Spirit, but this Flower Spirit was not the flower spirit, but rather the plant itself, lacking sentience.</p><p>But these poisonous flowers were too uncanny, capable of producing Flower Fairies, suggesting a possibility of sentience. Qin Sang couldn't entirely trust the scripture.</p><p>Was the flower dew nourished by resentment truly pure?  Did the cultivation technique contain unknown dangers?</p><p>For instance, the White Jade Elder wasn't the creator, but an effigy of an evil god.</p><p>Cultivating the *Poison God Scripture* would ultimately lead to resentment entangling the cultivator, turning them into a follower and sacrifice of the evil god.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered. Resentment would undoubtedly affect the primordial spirit. If the *Poison God Scripture* was a trap laid by the evil god, then it had targeted the wrong person.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang hadn't yet discovered any signs related to the evil god; it was merely speculation.</p><p>The jade Buddha gave Qin Sang the courage to try, but he wouldn’t be reckless.</p><p>Qin Sang had a plan.</p><p>First, he would refine the poisonous miasma, confirming his ability to cultivate the poisonous essence before refining the orb, ensuring the jade Buddha could dispel resentment, thus allowing him to safely cultivate.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the space. If all went well, this would be his launching pad, using these flower fields to reach unimaginable heights in a short time.</p><p>Compared to cultivators of the same level, he was young and didn't need to rush, but to find the path to ascension before the Daoist sect, he must improve his strength quickly.</p><p>Moreover, having received this opportunity, after weighing the gains and risks, there was no reason to miss it.</p><p>Time was never wasted; an earlier breakthrough meant a greater chance of achieving Daoist mastery.</p><p>As for the pain of refining poison into essence and tempering his body with poison, Qin Sang didn't care. What pain could compare to becoming a corpse puppet?</p><p>With that thought, Qin Sang eagerly wanted to return to his cave, but first, he had something to do.</p><p>He flickered, flying to the summit of a mountain in the center of the space, sat cross-legged, and spread his spiritual sense, sensing the entire array.</p><p>Moments later, the mountains trembled, and a booming sound echoed through the ranges.</p><p>Above the heavens, in all directions, the distorted power of the spirit array violently vibrated, forming a storm that swept towards the sky.</p><p>To the naked eye, it looked like someone was wielding a brush in the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely busy, his ten fingers continuously striking, pouring out his true energy, transforming it into talismans flying in all directions.</p><p>He was repairing the spirit array.</p><p>As time passed, the array had deformed, exposing the flower fields. Qin Sang now needed to reseal the space, preventing others from entering and claiming the flower fields for himself.</p><p>The strange phenomena outside were more violent than inside the space.</p><p>Where the palace once stood, a howling wind spread outward, the mist dissolving, creating new whirlwinds that swept in all directions.</p><p>This wasn't simple wind; it was infused with poisonous mist.  Green flowers bloomed within the gale, then shattered, a cycle of life and death, indicating that the void seemed on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>Meanwhile, outside the poisonous lake, Qing Dan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanren, one seated and one standing, had just taken medicine to treat and detoxify.</p><p>They keenly sensed the changes in the poisonous lake. Qing Dan Yuanjun, who had been sitting, suddenly stood up, exchanged a look with Boxian Shanren, and immediately returned to the poisonous lake.</p><p>Passing through the outer layer of poisonous water, they immediately saw a huge mass of mist, filled with extremely chaotic power, mixed with poisonous restrictions, rapidly spreading outward.</p><p>The two masters' expressions were extremely grave.</p><p>Before the change, Qin Sang might have had a chance, but with the collapse of the inner poisonous lake, Qin Sang, at its center, had no chance of survival.</p><p>Unless a miracle occurred.</p><p>Even if they risked entering the mist, they probably wouldn't even find a body.</p><p>After a long silence, Boxian Shanren sighed, "Fortunately, our friend obtained that spiritual tree, but unfortunately, Qingfeng Daozhang…"</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun also sighed, "Neither alive nor dead, how can I explain to the Sword-Holding Real Person?"</p><p>As far as they knew, Qingfeng Daozhang was alone, without any disciples, but the Sword-Holding Real Person highly valued him, even creating a cave dwelling for him in his own Daoist domain.</p><p>In the flower field.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, seeing the two masters retreat from the poisonous lake through the spirit array, then cast several restrictions on the array.</p><p>Turning his gaze, scanning the flower fields, Qin Sang noticed that some flower dew was ripe for harvesting.</p><p>He took a jade bottle from his storage ring, approaching a patch of flower fields, hovering above a spiritual flower.</p><p>The flower was enormous, its stamen like a silver basin.  The flower spirit slept within the stamen. Qin Sang extended his right hand, his palm exhaling true energy, transforming it into a long, transparent needle.</p><p>He gently inserted the needle tip.</p><p>As if in pain, the flower's stamen suddenly contracted, its petals trembling slightly before slowly unfolding.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew the needle and flew to the next flower.</p><p>As he harvested more flowers, a drop of crystalline liquid gradually formed on the needle's tip—pure flower dew, pure flower poison!</p><p>He collected the drop into the jade bottle.</p><p>Like a bee among flowers, Qin Sang busied himself in the fields, finally reaching two patches of superior quality flowers.</p><p>The quality of the dew from different fields was not significantly different; only fewer superior flowers were needed to produce a single drop.</p><p>His movements became increasingly proficient, soon harvesting all the flower dew. With a wave of his hand, the jade bottles floated before him.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly, putting them away and returning to his cave.</p><p>He then explored the jade slip containing the Poison God Scripture, reading it several times to memorize it, then sat silently.</p><p>Time was unknown within the poisonous lake.</p><p>Undisturbed, Qin Sang sat for an unknown amount of time before finally acting.</p><p>The poison orb flew out of his dantian, a bright light flashing, carrying a strand of intense poison.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and inhaled it!</p>
