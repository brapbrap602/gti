Chapter 674 Heavenwitch Island


As instructed by Qin Sang, he activated the power of the teleportation talisman. A shield enveloped his body, and the ancient teleportation formation pulsed with light, initiating the familiar teleportation process.


His two previous experiences using the ancient formation at the Upper Prime Clarity Palace had been disorienting and tumultuous. The one at the Violet Palace was even worse, costing him an arm.


This time, the teleportation was smoother than the previous three. He felt no discomfort before his feet landed on solid ground. The teleportation was a complete success.


Qin Sang, Zou Lao, and the others appeared in a spacious hall. As the light from the teleportation formation faded, they saw witch guards standing before them, each with a fierce demeanor.


While Qin Sang surveyed the surroundings, Zou Lao led the way out of the hall.


Qin Sang quickly followed. Stepping out of the hall, his vision broadened.


The teleportation formation was located on a mountain on Heavenwitch Island. At the foot of the mountain lay a large city, fully visible from the hall.


Heavenwitch Island lived up to its name. It was vast, and the city occupied only a small portion of it. Outside the city, mountains rose and fell, stretching to the horizon where the vast ocean shimmered.


While in the western region of the Witch God Continent, Qin Sang had inquired about the Storm-Wracked Sea, hearing various rumors.


Some said the sea was blood-red with a pungent, fishy smell. Others claimed that sea monsters constantly patrolled the waters, and anyone entering would be immediately besieged…


The rumors were numerous and varied, painting the Storm-Wracked Sea as a hellish realm.


Now, the water outside the island looked no different from the Boundless Sea. Qin Sang gazed intently for a while but found no trace of sea monsters. He did, however, occasionally spot the light trails of cultivators flying by.


“I need to visit some friends and gather some information. Ran Luo, you can take our fellow Daoists around the city. There are quite a few good things here. Many unexplored islands in the Storm-Wracked Sea yield rare treasures not found in the Boundless Sea. Most of them end up on Great Desolation Island and Heavenwitch Island. You might find something useful…” Zou Lao turned and addressed the group.


Qin Sang's heart stirred. If he could buy Myriad Age Camphorwood here, he wouldn't need to search for it painstakingly. He had enough spirit stones, and if necessary, he could even sell his Golden Orchid Grass.


Ran Luo acknowledged with a "Yes."


Zou Lao, accompanied by the witch cultivator, was about to leave when he seemed to remember something. He paused, pointing to the mountain peaks on either side. “These two areas are forbidden zones on Heavenwitch Island. Many Nascent Soul ancestors are in secluded cultivation on the mountains. Don't wander there unnecessarily. The left mountain houses the caves of our human Nascent Soul ancestors, and the right one belongs to the witches.”


“Why are there so many human Nascent Soul cultivators on Heavenwitch Island?” Qin Sang turned to look at the mountain on the left.


The two mountains were the most scenic spots on Heavenwitch Island, with elegant pavilions and palaces nestled among lush forests and clear springs. The spiritual energy there was incredibly rich.


Qin Sang was certain that these two mountains occupied the best locations on Heavenwitch Island's spirit veins.


Surprisingly, judging by Zou Lao’s tone, there seemed to be quite a few human Nascent Soul cultivators on Heavenwitch Island.


Humans and witches had formed an uneasy alliance against the sea monsters, but the divide between them remained. Otherwise, the human cultivators on the Witch God Continent wouldn't have panicked and fled at the slightest hint of unrest among the witches.


Even in the Storm-Wracked Sea, this gap was hard to bridge completely.


Heavenwitch Island was the witches' stronghold. It was normal for human Nascent Soul cultivators to pass through, but it was strange that the witches would tolerate so many of them residing there.


Zou Lao whispered, “I had the same question as you, Daoist, when I first arrived in the Storm-Wracked Sea. Later, I heard rumors that the teleportation formation built by the witches was related to our human grandmasters.  This mountain has been occupied by our human Nascent Soul ancestors since the day Heavenwitch Island was established. The true reason, however, remains unknown…”


After seeing Zou Lao off, Qin Sang and the others descended the mountain on foot and entered the city. They soon discovered that Heavenwitch Island was completely different from what they had imagined.


They had heard many times about the dangers of the Storm-Wracked Sea. Cultivators in the Boundless Sea believed that only Core Formation experts could enter the sea to hunt monsters, while Foundation Establishment cultivators dared to enter only if they were incredibly bold or desperate for a breakthrough.


To Qin Sang's surprise, besides Core Formation experts, there were also many Foundation Establishment, Qi Refining cultivators, and even a large number of mortals in the city.


It was no different from a city in the Boundless Sea.


The female Daoist Hui Wen, seemingly also entering the Storm-Wracked Sea for the first time, looked around with curiosity.


“What's so strange about this?” Ran Luo said, “These people weren't teleported here. They are descendants of cultivators who entered the Storm-Wracked Sea long ago. Some lack talent, and most don't even have spirit roots. They can't afford the spirit stones for teleportation and can only eke out a living in the Storm-Wracked Sea. You'll see when you leave the island that there are many islands without spirit veins outside Heavenwitch Island, inhabited by mortals living in villages. Similar situations exist on Great Desolation Island.  In fact, even on stable islands like Allrock Island, there are quite a few mortals and low-level cultivators.”


“Aren't they afraid of sea monsters? Those mortals shouldn't have the ability to defend themselves. Does Heavenwitch Island send people to protect them?” Hui Wen asked.


Ran Luo shook her head. “Heavenwitch Island and Great Desolation Island are different from other islands. Except for the initial period after their establishment, when they were besieged and attacked by sea monsters, as the cultivators' territory gradually expanded, most of the monsters around these two islands have been eliminated.  Even during the most critical times, these two islands remained relatively safe. However, accidents are inevitable. Occasionally, some reckless sea monster might stray in. If the patrolling cultivators can't deal with it in time…”


Ran Luo didn't finish her sentence, but Qin Sang and the others understood what would happen.


Survival of the fittest. Heavenwitch Island certainly wouldn't invest too much manpower and resources in protecting useless mortals. They could only hope that the patrolling cultivators would be diligent.


As they spoke, they arrived at a large area of tall buildings, some made of stone, others of wood, with many cultivators coming and going.


Ran Luo entered the building at the front, returning shortly after with a wry smile. “We're out of luck. The grand auction isn't for another month. We probably won't be able to wait. These buildings sell all sorts of treasures. We might as well look for what we need individually and meet at the city gate in the evening to see Zou Lao.”


The grand auction was the biggest event on Heavenwitch Island, with countless treasures, held every three months. They had hoped to witness it, but the timing was off.


Qin Sang had the same intention. After hearing Ran Luo's explanation, he bid farewell to the others and entered a building alone.


This building mainly sold spirit materials for refining tools and spirit herbs for alchemy. As Qin Sang walked in, the eyes of several servant girls lit up. The most attractive one gracefully approached him.
