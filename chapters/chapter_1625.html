<h1>Chapter 1616: Departure</h1><p>After mastering the *Zhanjin Kongyu Jue*, manipulating gold and jade artifacts became much easier and more powerful.  Against opponents using jade artifacts, this technique could disrupt their power.</p><p>This gave Yu Zhi a significant advantage, making her a perfect counter to Yang Zhenren.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Yang Zhenren abandoned the offensive, his brow furrowed in thought.</p><p>Everyone held their breath, anticipating his next move.</p><p>"I didn't approve of Seventh Sister's choice of the *Zhanjin Kongyu Jue*, but sometimes it does yield surprising results..."</p><p>Jin Wudai paused, noticing a monk entering, and turned his gaze.</p><p>The monk approached Master Xingji, whispered something, and handed him a jade talisman.</p><p>Master Xingji's expression remained unchanged, but he immediately rose to leave.</p><p>"Master, where are you going?"</p><p>Jin Wudai stopped him.</p><p>"Amitabha, a small matter. I'll be back soon. Please forgive my rudeness, Master Jin," Master Xingji vaguely replied. Jin Wudai, unsure, didn't press further.</p><p>Master Xingji's prominent position made his actions immediately noticeable. Countless eyes followed him as he left the assembly, prompting speculation.</p><p>For a moment, the duel on the stage was forgotten.</p><p>Master Xingji left the assembly and returned to his temple.</p><p>The Holy Light Saint and the Green Fox Saint King were discussing the hunt for the beast when they sensed Master Xingji's presence. The Saint King turned to the door: "Something's happened at the assembly?"</p><p>The Holy Light Saint's tone was flat, but his killing intent was palpable.</p><p>The plan to lure out the serpent had worked!</p><p>Master Xingji presented the jade talisman, saying solemnly: "A message from Wan Du Mountain: the lost vault of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect has been found in Nan Zhou!"</p><p>"The Wuxiang Immortal Sect?"</p><p>The Holy Light Saint examined it, surprised. "The vault is in Taiyue Mountain?"</p><p>Then, he realized something was amiss. "The remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect could not have infiltrated Taiyue Mountain and opened the vault overnight. They must have been acting for a long time—how did you miss this?"</p><p>Master Xingji replied shamefacedly, "The monastery wasn't negligent, but we received no information."</p><p>"Unless someone helped them hide!"</p><p>The Holy Light Saint coldly snorted, without blaming Master Xingji.</p><p>Master Xingji, chosen as the abbot for his unquestionable ability, meticulous nature, and suitability for the position, had the Holy Light Saint's full trust.</p><p>"Where is Purple Thunder?"</p><p>The Holy Light Saint grasped the core issue.</p><p>The remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, while capable of deception, couldn't have operated without leaving a trace. Something was very strange!</p><p>With both Daoists and Buddhists hunting the remnants, only the Eight Views, intimately familiar with the Ganlu Monastery's layout, could have pulled off such a feat under their very noses.  Furthermore, the close ties between Taiyue Sect and the Eight Views, coupled with the vault's location in Taiyue Mountain, made it all the more convenient for them.</p><p>Master Xingji, having instantly understood this, had remained composed during the assembly, awaiting the Saint's decision. "Purple Thunder is at the assembly. I've had two junior brothers watching him."</p><p>"No need. That person is an imposter!"</p><p>The Holy Light Saint, with his superior intellect, instantly guessed the Eight Views' motivation:  they mistook Dan Yu Zhenjun for dead, leading them to suspect him.</p><p>"That suspicious and reckless Purple Thunder dared to abet the Wuxiang Immortal Sect remnants, allowing them into Tian Tong Palace, then Tian Xiang Palace – not fearing the release of the ancient demon sealed there and the ensuing catastrophe! Only the demon's ascension with the Immortal Palace prevented a disaster."</p><p>Pausing, the Holy Light Saint ordered Master Xingji: "Quickly gather your men and head to Nan Zhou.  Let's wipe out the Wuxiang Immortal Sect remnants!"</p><p>Master Xingji departed to carry out his orders. The Holy Light Saint turned to the Green Fox Saint King: "As you heard, the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's vault has appeared, saving us the trouble of searching.  As it was hastily sealed, many texts are likely intact.  Having controlled the Immortal Palace longer than the Wuwang Palace, the Wuxiang Immortal Sect discovered the Sword Tomb first and knows the Immortal Palace better than anyone."</p><p>The Green Fox Saint King waved a jade hand, dissolving her topographic map into countless light particles.  She said lazily, "I'm not solely fixated on beast hunting. Even if we capture a beast, the journey—with demonic interference and the constant threat of other beasts—doesn't guarantee our survival. Since the vault has appeared, we should go to Nan Zhou. We might find our answers there."</p><p>Two Nascent Soul cultivators immediately set off southward.</p><p>...</p><p>On the arena.</p><p>Unaffected by Master Xingji's departure, the duel had already concluded.</p><p>As Grandmaster Qi Shen predicted, Master Yang, his magic weapon suppressed, lost to Yu Zhi and conceded defeat.</p><p>A Golden Jade Sect elder, presiding over the ceremony, swiftly ascended the arena and announced Yu Zhi's victory, about to invite the next pair of duelists.</p><p>“We now invite Chan Master Xiaoxing of the Sweet Dew Monastery and… and…”</p><p>The Golden Jade Sect elder suddenly faltered.</p><p>Master Xingji, having returned, issued a command.  A large commotion erupted from the Sweet Dew Monastery's section, and then, without looking back, they all left the venue.</p><p>“What's going on?”</p><p>Jin Wu Dai was puzzled and apprehensive.</p><p>Just as he was about to stop Master Xingji to find out what happened, he saw the Eight Views experts also leaving.</p><p>In a five-hundred-year-cycle ceremony, two top sects left only a handful of people; such an unprecedented event had never happened before.</p><p>Soon, whispers circulated throughout the assembly, quickly escalating into a major uproar.</p><p>“Southern Province is in upheaval!”</p><p>“An Immortal Mansion has appeared!”</p><p>“It's said to be the work of the Mount Tai Sect, no wonder Yue Lingtian wasn't present!”</p><p>“The Sweet Dew Monastery and the Eight Views are certainly heading towards the Immortal Mansion!”</p><p>“An ancient Immortal Mansion, a tremendous opportunity!  I wonder if we can still make it! I wish I hadn't come to this ridiculous ceremony!”  Many deeply regretted their attendance.</p><p>...</p><p>Soon, all the high-ranking members of various sects confirmed through various channels that the emergence of the Immortal Mansion in the Southern Province was not a rumor.</p><p>And they had received even more precise information.</p><p>The Immortal Mansion is highly likely to be the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect!</p><p>The Central Plains factions are somewhat familiar with the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, knowing it was the sole dominant power in the Central Plains before Daoism and Buddhism flourished.  Its remnants undoubtedly contain countless treasures and profound inheritances!</p><p>It’s clear why the Eight Views and Sweet Dew Monastery couldn't stay put.</p><p>Immediately, regardless of Jin Wu Dai's pleas, the various sects' masters left.</p><p>The journey to the Southern Province is long. Despite their high cultivation, even at full speed, they wouldn't arrive in a day or two, likely missing the first wave of treasure hunters.  They could only hope for some complications during the opening of the mansion.</p><p>The Golden Jade Sect's meticulously planned ceremony was on the verge of becoming a farce.</p><p>Jin Wu Dai's face was ashen, but there was nothing he could do.</p><p>Finally, Jin Wu Dai summoned the sect elders, gave some instructions, and also took several experts to the Southern Province.</p>
