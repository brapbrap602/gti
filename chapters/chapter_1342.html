<h1></h1><p>Similar scenes frequently appeared within the Violet Palace.</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator from the desert had an experience much like Qin Sang's.</p><p>But he hadn't noticed it in time, took a wrong step, stumbled in, and then his figure vanished without a trace, leaving no ripple, his fate unknown.</p><p>The lake water was clear.</p><p>The bamboo grove was fragrant.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, yet within this tranquil scene, he sensed a hint of unease.  He cautiously retreated, circling around the small lake, his speed increasing by a third.</p><p>This Violet Palace was no longer the same Violet Palace. In the future, even Nascent Soul cultivators might find it difficult to traverse.</p><p>Bypassing the ancient medicinal garden, Qin Sang hurried on for a while and saw a familiar place, the Sword Path Grand Hall where the teleportation formation was located.</p><p>This place was no exception, completely transformed.</p><p>The scene before Qin Sang left him stunned.</p><p>He stood on the ground, craning his neck, barely able to see the entrance of the Sword Path Grand Hall from the depths of the five-colored auspicious clouds.</p><p>One must know, this mountain was originally not prominent among the peaks.</p><p>This mountain had unexpectedly grown from the earth like a living thing, its terrain magnificent and sharp, piercing the clouds like a sword, in no way inferior to the Heavenly Mountains.  The surrounding peaks had also undergone similar changes, but none were as drastic as this one.</p><p>Surrounded by the mountains, a single peak stood out!</p><p>The Ebony Sword vibrated slightly.</p><p>A familiar fluctuation transmitted, indicating that the restrictions on the Sword Path Grand Hall hadn't changed, and the ancient teleportation formation should still be there.</p><p>The good news was that the entrance of the Sword Path Grand Hall was still an ordinary cliff, showing no abnormalities; otherwise, this passage connecting the two realms would have been exposed.</p><p>"Has the Seven Kills Hall been affected, or have only changes occurred in the Violet Palace? Time is of the essence. After this matter is settled, I'll go to the other side and have a look."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced as he continued towards Sword Scar Mountain.</p><p>Traveling through countless secret realms, both Qin Sang and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly were extremely vigilant. Along the way, they encountered some close calls but ultimately arrived at Sword Scar Mountain safely.</p><p>From afar, one could see the clouds and mist swelling on Sword Scar Mountain, enveloping the surrounding mountain ranges.  Upon closer approach, as expected, the entire mountain range was affected by the illusion formation.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to act rashly. He walked around the edge of the illusion formation, arriving at the position closest to the Sword Scar. After investigating, he couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>The Sword Scar was astonishing, its sword energy enduring!</p><p>The dissipating sword energy continued to impact the illusion formation, yet it was also suppressed by the formation.</p><p>They were in constant conflict.</p><p>This Primordial Illusion Formation was indeed broken and riddled with flaws. Although far more dangerous than before, it wasn't without opportunity.</p><p>No one was around.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly flew out of his Qi Sea, landing on Qin Sang's shoulder, gently flapping its wings. Lightning gathered within the Heavenly Eyes on its wings, becoming increasingly vibrant and spirited.</p><p>The Heavenly Eyes were profound, as if containing a pure and boundless sky within.</p><p>Qin Sang tilted his head, observing the illusion formation while communicating with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, silently activating the Witch Clan's secret technique to aid the butterfly in utilizing its innate divine ability.</p><p>Within the chaotic illusions, Qin Sang found a path, but he could only see the very beginning, forced to proceed step by step, adapting to the situation.</p><p>To be safe, Qin Sang summoned his Nascent Soul Puppet and ordered it to scout ahead.</p><p>Man and puppet ascended the mountain on foot.</p><p>The moment they stepped into the illusion formation, the surrounding scenery abruptly changed.</p><p>The palaces on Sword Scar Mountain vanished.</p><p>In their place was a wide river of lava.  The lava flowed, and scorching heat rushed towards him, incredibly realistic.  Splashes of lava erupted, emitting fluctuations that possessed power that startled Qin Sang.</p><p>However, not far upstream, there was a fault in the lava river, as if two worlds were stacked together, creating a conflict.</p><p>With the help of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang easily found these flaws, navigating through the illusion formation.</p><p>Everything went smoothly, and Qin Sang silently calculated the distance.</p><p>He should have already ascended Sword Scar Mountain.  If nothing unexpected happened, it wouldn't be long before he reached the alchemy chamber where the Southern Bright Nether Fire resided.</p><p>Just at this moment, a sudden change occurred.  The Nascent Soul Puppet in front stopped in place, the crimson in its eyes fading at a visible speed, its gaze becoming vacant.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's wings froze.</p><p>Qin Sang only felt a vague consciousness from the butterfly before losing contact. Looking down, the butterfly seemed to have fallen asleep.</p><p>His heart pounded. If the Southern Bright Nether Fire caused harm to the Heaven's Eye Butterfly and the Nascent Soul Puppet, the loss would be devastating.</p><p>He steadied his mind, scanning his surroundings, confirming nothing unusual, and began to examine himself.</p><p>He was unaffected.</p><p>Looking at the Heaven's Eye Butterfly and the Nascent Soul Puppet again, the connection between them and him hadn't been severed, but they were both in a deep sleep.  At this moment, the Nascent Soul Puppet's eyes twitched slightly, seeming to struggle against something.</p><p>"The Jade Buddha again!"</p><p>Qin Sang roughly guessed the reason. It seemed the illusion formation also had the effect of confusing the mind. The most insidious part was that the change occurred without any warning, causing one to unknowingly fall asleep and become lost within.</p><p>The Jade Buddha had saved him once more.</p><p>Even the Primordial Illusion Formation couldn't affect him.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, increasingly realizing that the higher his cultivation became, the more he encountered methods targeting the primordial spirit, and the more crucial the Jade Buddha's role would become.</p><p>He could only rely on himself from now on.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the puppet and the butterfly, his heart filled with vigilance.</p><p>Passing through a pavilion and a waterside corridor,</p><p>He suddenly heard rustling sounds ahead, as if something was moving through the forest.</p><p>"Someone?"</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback.</p><p>After a moment's thought, besides Old Devil Ye, no one could have arrived here faster than him.</p><p>Why would Old Devil Ye come here instead of the Heavenly Mountains?</p><p>Qin Sang felt it was unlikely. He concealed his aura, walked forward for a while, hid in the shadows, and waited.  Soon, he saw several red foxes appear at the edge of the dense forest, playfully frolicking, the sounds they made being the source of the rustling.</p><p>He hadn't expected to encounter living creatures here.</p><p>Qin Sang knew these red foxes couldn't be real; otherwise, Wandering Scholar would have discovered them long ago. He channeled his True Essence into his eyes, staring intently for a moment, and indeed made a discovery.</p><p>These red foxes appeared lifelike, but strange fluctuations occasionally rippled through their bodies, revealing their illusory nature.  They were indeed spirit beasts manifested by the Primordial Illusion Formation.  The formation was broken, so they were also weakened.</p><p>The red foxes were too lively and lifelike.</p><p>The creator of this formation must have had a specific purpose in creating these spirit beasts. Even in its broken state, Qin Sang didn't want to experience the red foxes' abilities.</p><p>But this was the only path to the stone hall!</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was deep in thought, he suddenly noticed one of the red foxes stop playing, its pointed ears twitching slightly, as if it had sensed something.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression subtly changed. He quickly retreated. The fox's senses were too sharp. If the power of the illusion formation hadn't been greatly diminished, he would have been discovered long ago.</p><p>He furrowed his brow, pondered for a moment, and then shifted his gaze to the side.</p><p>The Sword Scar was in that direction.  Even from here, he could feel the sharp edge of the sword energy.</p><p>The origins of the red foxes were unknown, so there was no need to force his way through. Utilizing the terrain, luring the red foxes towards the Sword Scar, and borrowing the sword energy to kill them wasn't a bad option, and it would also save effort. </p>
