<h1>Chapter 597: The Immortal Platform (Does this count as a triple release?)</h1><p>After several spatial jumps, they arrived at the location indicated by Wandering Scholar.</p><p>Sword Qi shattered a point of light.</p><p>Countless motes of light scattered, illuminating a crack in the darkness.</p><p>"Go in!"</p><p>Wandering Scholar shouted in a low voice. Qin Sang immediately enveloped both of them with his sword and rushed into the fissure.</p><p>The next moment, a terrifying squeezing force pressed down on them, but before they could resist, it vanished instantly. Light dispelled the darkness, and a ruined scene appeared before their eyes.</p><p>Although it was only for a moment, the feeling of almost being crushed into paste was too vivid and terrifying, giving Qin Sang a cold sweat.</p><p>In his field of vision were the ruins of a mostly collapsed palace and a scene of decay.</p><p>Previously, there must have been more than one palace here, surely a magnificent complex. Now, only this fragment remained, the rest vanished.</p><p>In front of the palace, a large area still had remnants of pavilions and terraces.</p><p>But the pools were dry, the roads deserted, and between the cracks of the stone slabs on the ground, clumps of weeds grew vigorously, thicker than those in the valley below.</p><p>Near the ancient palace, a few broken walls still stood stubbornly, surrounded by rubble and debris, a scene of utter desolation.</p><p>Even so, from the remaining walls, one could still discern some of its former grandeur.</p><p>In front of the palace ruins, there was a broken wall, and on one corner hung a dilapidated plaque, swaying precariously.</p><p>The plaque had lost its luster, becoming dark, decaying wood. The characters on it were barely recognizable, but they were indeed the character 'Gathering' recognized by Wandering Scholar.</p><p>This place wasn't large. A sweep of divine consciousness could cover it entirely.</p><p>It was indeed a ruin, and even inside the Gathering Divinity Palace, there was nothing unusual.</p><p>Those who discovered this place, having wasted their energy and time breaking the formation, had searched it more than once, filled with great hope, but found no treasures and left in frustration.</p><p>"This is indeed a part of the Gathering Divinity Palace, and it is the main hall where the Gathering Divinity Bowl was stored!"</p><p>Wandering Scholar said in a deep voice, "Most of the Gathering Divinity Palace fell into the Hanging Garden during the collapse, and the treasures inside were looted by those Nascent Soul cultivators. I didn't expect the most important part to fall here. There should be an Immortal Platform in the hall where the Gathering Divinity Bowl was placed. It was originally protected by an immortal restriction, but the restriction was destroyed, and the platform became hidden."</p><p>Qin Sang and Wandering Scholar exchanged glances, then flashed to the broken wall, looked up at the plaque, and began searching the ruins.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, sending a gust of wind to clear away the rubble, revealing a cracked floor.</p><p>Some of the broken marks were clearly not from ancient times, but from later treasure hunters who ultimately found nothing.</p><p>According to what Yi Tiannie saw in the ancient texts, a special mantra and specific steps were needed within the hall to activate the palace's hidden restriction and reveal the true form of the treasure.</p><p>He found the central position of the Gathering Divinity Palace.</p><p>The floor tiles there were shattered, with dozens of sword marks, a scene of chaos. The soil underneath had been turned over, but on the surface, everything looked normal.</p><p>Fortunately, the outline of the Gathering Divinity Palace remained. Qin Sang stood at the center, feet together, and formed hand seals.</p><p>Now, he was a little nervous, unsure if the records in the ancient texts were reliable. Wandering Scholar only knew that this was the main hall of the Gathering Divinity Palace, and the Gathering Divinity Bowl was indeed hidden here, but he wasn't sure if this method was correct.</p><p>The unusual state of the surrounding vegetation suggested a high probability that the Three Lights Liquid was hidden here.</p><p>It would be heartbreaking to leave empty-handed if they couldn't open it.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Completing a hand seal, Qin Sang struck the ground with his palm.</p><p>It sank into the soil without any change.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at his hands, focusing on the incantation, not looking at his feet. Dozens of complex hand seals were formed in one go, then Qin Sang suddenly took a step.</p><p>Swiftly changing positions, there was still no change on the ground.</p><p>For a time, Qin Sang's steps followed the Heavenly Stems, circling the center of the Gathering Divinity Palace, his figure constantly shifting like a flitting butterfly, exceptionally agile.</p><p>At the same time, countless hand seals were driven into the ground, dazzling to the eye.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the secret method was almost complete, but nothing happened.</p><p>A faint worry appeared on Wandering Scholar's face. The Three Lights Liquid was related to his life, and even with his calm temperament, he couldn't maintain absolute composure.</p><p>Finally, with another step, Qin Sang gracefully turned, his feet landing back at the center of the Gathering Divinity Palace.</p><p>'Thump!'</p><p>The final hand seal struck the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang stared down at the ground, finding it the same as before. Unwilling to give up, he extended his divine consciousness, scanning the ground below.</p><p>"Perhaps the immortal restriction has changed, and this method can't summon the Immortal Platform."</p><p>Wandering Scholar sighed, "Forget it, this is my fate, I have no connection with the Three Lights Liquid. Brother Qin, you can collect more ancient books taken from the Purple Subtlety Palace to understand immortal restrictions. If you come back again, you might be able to find the Three Lights Liquid. It's a divine object, a great aid, don't miss it…"</p><p>Wandering Scholar was very disappointed, but he was洒脱, not lingering.</p><p>Seeing that it was impossible, he turned to leave.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after taking a step, Wandering Scholar suddenly stopped, turning his head to stare at the space above Qin Sang, his eyes filled with intense surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang also noticed the anomaly and quickly retreated.</p><p>The next moment, a rainbow light descended from the sky, breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>After the rainbow light scattered, it gathered together, condensing and not dispersing.</p><p>In the center of the Gathering Divinity Palace, within the rainbow light, a square outline appeared, the shadow of the Immortal Platform!</p><p>The Immortal Platform was very large, occupying most of the Gathering Divinity Palace, its top flat and several zhang higher than the remaining walls.</p><p>The shadow of the Immortal Platform became increasingly solid, emerging from the void. Before the light rain appeared, there was no sign of it, no wonder they couldn't find it even after digging three feet deep.</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his hands tightly. Against all odds, he had summoned the Immortal Platform!</p><p>The phenomenon appeared and changed very quickly. Soon, an extremely tall Immortal Platform stood before them, towering in the center of the Gathering Divinity Palace.</p><p>They suppressed their excitement and, after confirming there were no dangerous restrictions around the platform, flew onto it together.</p><p>The top of the Immortal Platform was a vast square platform, with jade pillars, carved dragons and phoenixes, extremely ornate. In the very center of the platform was a small groove.</p><p>Visually, the groove was small, about the size of an alms bowl used by mortal monks.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the edge of the Immortal Platform, looking curiously at the groove.</p><p>This should be the place where the Gathering Divinity Bowl was placed. He didn't expect the bowl to be so small, yet it was said to gather the power of the Taiyin, the Sun, and the Zhoutian stars.</p><p>The methods of ancient mighty figures were truly profound and wondrous!</p><p>At this moment, the groove was empty.</p><p>Wandering Scholar said in a disappointed tone, "The Gathering Divinity Bowl is indeed gone, either stolen or destroyed in the chaos. What a pity! What a pity!"</p><p>Qin Sang also felt it was a great pity.</p><p>His gaze swept across the empty Immortal Platform, and he asked with some confusion, "Senior, where do you think the Three Lights Liquid might be hidden?"</p>
