<h1>Chapter 1812: The Poison God Scripture</h1><p>Entering this chamber, Qin Sang encountered various strange occurrences.</p><p>The White Jade Elder appeared to be merely an ordinary statue.</p><p>Yet, black skeletons knelt before it in prostration, demonstrating their devoutness.</p><p>For these black skeletons to have entered here, their cultivation in life must not have been weak.</p><p>A cultivator of no low cultivation base, showing such devotion, either was being controlled or this place truly housed a deity.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, silently observing the cavern, and discovered a pouch beneath the black skeletons.</p><p>The pouch was vibrantly colored, certainly a treasure.</p><p>Besides this, no other artifacts or jade slips were found. The pouch was likely a type of spatial storage device.</p><p>Also, Qin Sang noticed that the skeletons’ postures were unnatural, with several twisted and broken parts, indicating serious injuries suffered in life.</p><p>He immediately recalled the broken bones outside the stone door. This skeleton was complete; the broken bones must belong to someone else. A battle had occurred here.</p><p>“Internal conflict or external enemy?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused silently.</p><p>The restriction on the hidden door could shield Hua Ling's perception, but it was unclear if it could withstand evil spirits.</p><p>Those who died here may have been attacked by evil spirits, or perhaps they had killed each other.</p><p>The corpses had become skeletons, indicating they had been dead for a long time.  The cavern was littered with bones; no useful traces remained.</p><p>However, these discoveries were enough to put Qin Sang on high alert.  The White Jade Elder, the evil spirits of unknown origin, and possibly even an evil spirit nest – everything seemed so unusual.</p><p>“There are Daoist gods, demon gods, and naturally, there are also evil gods…”</p><p>Qin Sang took a final look at the White Jade Elder, pondered for a moment, and slowly retreated.</p><p>After returning to the stone door, he sat cross-legged.</p><p>He did not choose to enter the cavern or use his spiritual sense to investigate the White Jade Elder, nor did he take the pouch.  Qin Sang was worried that rash actions might attract trouble, creating a difficult situation.</p><p>His current condition was poor. He urgently needed to resolve the accumulated toxins in his body.  Since there was no immediate danger, he should heal his injuries and restore his strength as soon as possible.</p><p>The mountain belly was quiet, like another world compared to the outside.</p><p>During this time, the stone door remained stable, confirming that Hua Ling would not force her way in.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to remain vigilant, primarily guarding against not the external Hua Ling, but the inner statue.</p><p>He entered a state of deep meditation, activating the poison pearl to refine the toxins within his body.</p><p>After careful analysis, Qin Sang found the relationship between these potent poisons: the poison in the poisonous water, the poison restriction at the seventh archway of the palace, the poison of the evil spirits, and even the restriction on the hidden door, were all intricately connected to the flower poison in the flower field.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the hidden door used the flower poison to create the restriction, thus blocking Hua Ling's perception.</p><p>This showed that the white bone flower field was the foundation of this poisonous domain.</p><p>The flower poison in the flower field was infused with Hua Ling's resentment, making its toxicity even stronger.  If handled carelessly, the resentful poison could invade the mind, causing significant trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang, of course, was not afraid of this. He treated it as ordinary potent poison. With the situation unclear, to recover quickly, he did not try to have the poison pearl absorb it, but instead used the Purifying Poison Radiance to expel it.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang's skin emanated a faint black gas, followed by a succession of colorful lights flashing, as wisps of poison were expelled from his body.</p><p>This poisonous gas drifted towards Qin Sang's chest, where it was bound by a layer of Purifying Poison Radiance, preventing it from dissipating.</p><p>Gradually, the amount of poison expelled from his body decreased, and Qin Sang's complexion finally returned to normal. He let out a long sigh of relief, and awoke serenely.</p><p>The light in his eyes was bright, fully restored!</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the poisonous gas before him, his palm lightly clenched, and the poisonous gas shrunk into a bead, but its color was mottled, far less pure than the round bead from within the evil spirit's body.</p><p>He casually put it into the Qianjun Ring, glanced at the hidden door, and got up to walk deeper into the cavern.</p><p>The White Jade Elder remained as before, standing on the altar, showing no change.</p><p>Qin Sang felt emboldened and boldly examined the White Jade Elder. His gaze finally fell upon the pouch, and with a gesture, the pouch flew into his hand.</p><p>As expected, it was a spatial storage device.</p><p>The previous owner had not placed any special restrictions on the pouch, saving Qin Sang some effort.</p><p>Opening the pouch, the contents were revealed.</p><p>After carefully examining them for a while, Qin Sang gradually frowned.</p><p>The pouch mostly contained miscellaneous items, not what Qin Sang had expected.  He found nothing that could prove the identity of the black skeleton, nor any jade slips or anything else that would allow him to determine his origin through cultivation techniques or secret arts.</p><p>He could only conclude that this person was extremely skilled in the art of poisons.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were no records related to the flower field, so he still had to find his own way out.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the White Jade Elder, pondered for a moment, and decided to go out first.</p><p>His urgent departure stemmed from two desires: to thoroughly explore this space and to search for Qing Tan Yuan Jun and Bo Xian Shan Ren.  If these two cultivators had also fallen into the flower fields and were unable to escape, they were likely nearing their limit.</p><p>Having explored this place multiple times, they surely knew some hidden secrets, perhaps revealing the origin of the flower fields and a way out. Qin Sang, always planning his retreat first, only then investigated Bai Yu Lao Ren, ensuring a timely escape in case of emergency.</p><p>His caution stemmed from another reason.  Qin Sang's analysis of the flower poison revealed no connection to the strange poison that killed several disciples of Lou Gu Mountain, suggesting a hidden danger.</p><p>He quickly returned to the gate, his palm touching the stone door.  During the previous detoxification, the Tian Mu Butterfly had already thoroughly memorized the structure of the door's restriction, imprinting it in his mind.  </p><p>A flash of light, and Qin Sang reappeared outside the stone door.</p><p>The flower fields, previously calm, immediately erupted.  Flower spirits and clouds of resentment attacked, relentlessly pursuing Qin Sang.</p><p>Soaring into the air and surveying his surroundings, he found no unusual phenomena among the towering peaks.  Using his lightning escape technique, he leaped across the mountains, heading back towards the deepest part of the flower fields.</p><p>Two flower fields lay opposite two main halls. Qin Sang had previously fallen into the left one; now, he was heading to the other.</p><p>Employing swordsmanship and lightning magic, he carved a path.  Beautiful flowers and numerous skeletons met his gaze. The bones in this flower field were remarkably white and of exceptional quality.</p><p>Countless flower spirits surged towards him. No evil spirits were present, nor any sign of the two cultivators.</p><p>He wondered if the flower spirits consumed flesh. If the two cultivators had perished here, they might have already turned to bone.</p><p>His divine sense swept across the entire flower field, finding no trace of their belongings.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang fixed his gaze on the area behind the flower field.  According to the palace layout, there should be no flower fields there, only mountains.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang detected something unusual.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The Five Thunder Celestial Heart Seal reappeared, killing flower spirits. Qin Sang flew to a higher vantage point for a clearer view.</p><p>Behind the two flower fields, several mountain peaks were noticeably darker than their surroundings, shrouded in a gray mist, shadowy and eerie.</p><p>Even a brief glance caused Qin Sang's heart to pound.</p><p>For someone of his cultivation level, with his sharp spiritual perception, an illusion was highly unlikely.  Only one conclusion was possible: that place was extremely dangerous!</p><p>Without even considering personal investigation, Qin Sang decisively retreated from the flower field, speeding outwards, passing numerous flower fields until he reached the location corresponding to the palace gates.</p><p>His efforts proved fruitless; he found neither an exit nor the two cultivators.</p><p>He continued his escape. The vastness of this space exceeded his expectations, yet he finally reached the edge of the mountain range.</p><p>The edge of the space, like the heavens, was sealed by a distorting force.</p><p>His search yielding nothing, and burdened by accumulated flower poison, Qin Sang returned to the cave.</p><p>Having lost their target, the flower spirits dispersed, returning to their cocoons to sleep.</p><p>The place gradually returned to normal, yet a lingering silence pervaded the entire space.  Even before Qin Sang's intrusion, this silence had persisted for countless years, a stillness that even the dancing flower spirits couldn't erase.</p><p>Gently touching the stone door, Qin Sang fell into contemplation.</p><p>Then, he tapped his fingers, imbuing the stone door with seals, integrating them into the poison restriction and bringing it under his control.</p><p>This didn't alter the restriction's power, but allowed Qin Sang more deft manipulation and the ability to observe the outside world through it.</p><p>The Tian Mu Butterfly flew from his dantian, circled him once, and merged into the restriction, taking in the entire sky.</p><p>Qin Sang once again sat cross-legged behind the stone door, his mind connected to the butterfly, detoxifying while observing the force sealing the space.</p><p>After some time, he finally noticed something!</p><p>His Tian Mu divine ability locked onto a specific point in the sky. Qin Sang's brow furrowed in concentration, seemingly deducing something.</p><p>Gradually, his brow relaxed.</p><p>As expected, beyond that point lay a mist, one of the passages out of this space!</p><p>Knowing how to leave, Qin Sang calmed down, but kept the butterfly vigilant as he entered the cave a third time.</p><p>This time, without hesitation, Qin Sang sent a strand of his divine sense directly towards Bai Yu Lao Ren.</p><p>Moments later, a look of surprise appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>His divine sense penetrated the jade, revealing it not to be a statue, but something extraordinary—a jade slip containing a secret manual!</p><p>Breaking the seal, mysterious scriptures flooded Qin Sang's mind.  It was called the "Poison God Scripture!"  The title suggested a sacred text of the poison way.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  He examined the text carefully, gasping in shock halfway through.  His eyes widened in amazement as he murmured, "The flower field… it's artificially created, a fertile field for cultivating poison!  Bones as fertilizer, harvesting the dew of poisonous flowers…"</p><p>At that moment, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly transmitted a thought. Qin Sang collected his thoughts and, through the butterfly, 'saw' the scene outside the mountain.</p><p>Somewhere in the sky, a distortion in the force caused an unusual fluctuation, forming a vortex high above.</p><p>This was an external force.</p><p>The vortex twisted and struggled to form, showing that the force was attempting to break through the celestial dome but couldn't penetrate the distortion, only managing to maintain the vortex.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately understood.  Outside, it was likely the two Masters attempting to rescue him.</p><p>They had escaped.</p><p>Indeed, Qing Dan Yuanjun had repeatedly investigated the Poison Domain. While unaware of its true nature, she had discovered some signs and secrets, only fully understanding upon the palace's transformation.</p><p>Although they had escaped danger, they were severely injured, desperately suppressing the potent poison within them, hastily recovering some strength before finding a patch of mist to rescue Qin Sang.</p><p>As long as Qin Sang was alive, and saw the celestial sign, they could coordinate an escape.</p><p>"They are trustworthy,"</p><p>Qin Sang silently nodded.</p><p>In this world's Daoist sect, there were external threats from demons, but internal order was well-maintained.  Beasts and monstrous creatures were countless, unlike the Storm World, which lacked cultivation resources.  The Daoist cultivators Qin Sang had encountered were mostly refined, righteous individuals.</p><p>Within the Daoist sect, there was even a prevalent saying:  If one cultivates to prolong life, they must first accumulate virtue and merit. Merit without virtue leads to difficult attainment of Dao fruit.  Only with both virtue and merit can one become a true Master.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't respond to the two Masters. This "Poison God Canon" opened his eyes, and he was unwilling to leave yet.</p><p>"Since they're safe, I don't need to meet them immediately.  I'll think of an excuse later…"</p><p>The spatial array in this place was recorded in the "Poison God Canon".  Those unfamiliar with arrays could only enter and exit the flower field through the single entrance – the spirit tree in the palace.</p><p>The palace was a facade, a deception.</p><p>Originally, the palace had a restriction concealing the spirit tree.  Perhaps due to the passage of time, and being within the constantly shifting internal altar, the array was damaged, causing the spirit tree to appear, and even parts of the flower field to spill into reality, forming the mist.</p><p>Unaware, the three previously had unknowingly damaged the entrance when Qing Dan Yuanjun uprooted the spirit tree, leading to the palace's destruction and the appearance of a terrifying scene of spatial distortion, which worsened over time.</p><p>Even using the mist, it was easy to exit but difficult to re-enter.</p><p>The vortex in the sky persisted for a while before finally dissipating.  The two Masters received no response, assuming Qin Sang was dead. They left the Poison Domain to treat their own poison.</p><p>Qin Sang, meanwhile, was engrossed in the "Poison God Canon."</p><p>Initially, he was shocked by the origin of the bone flower field.</p><p>After reading the entire "Poison God Canon," he was astounded by its profound techniques.</p><p>Undoubtedly, this was a sacred text of poison cultivation, a superior lineage, and likely not from the Daoist sect, as the "Poison God Canon" didn't mention any Daoist techniques.</p><p>It was impossible to discern what technique the black skeletons had practiced.</p><p>Such an aberrant method of creating a field from corpses and cultivating poison from bones would certainly not be found within the Daoist sect.</p><p>It was certain that the black skeletons had practiced the "Poison God Canon."</p><p>Qin Sang took out two jade slips, the poison-refining secret techniques he received from Qing Dan Yuanjun.</p><p>This technique came from the "Poison God Canon," but was only a part of the lineage, not the core, a special technique used to assist cultivation.</p><p>The "Poison God Canon" was even more extreme. Its core technique was to introduce poison into the body, refining it into essence, cultivating poisonous essence to rapidly increase cultivation.</p><p>The bone flower field was a medicinal field.  The flower spirits weren't spiritual beings, but a rare type of poisonous flower.  The dew it produced was a superior poison, ideal for cultivating poisonous essence!</p><p>Cultivating with potent poisons was extremely dangerous.</p><p>During cultivation, residual poison would inevitably accumulate in the body. As the potent poison accumulated, and if one couldn't suppress it, they would inevitably die from a poisonous attack.</p><p>Thus, there was the poison-tempering secret technique – using the residual poison to temper the body, both to eliminate the poison and to strengthen the body, improving its resistance to potent poisons, achieving a unique form of body-and-cultivation dual cultivation.</p><p>However, this was merely a desperate measure, failing to truly solve the problem. While cultivation improved, the poisonous roots remained.  After cultivation began, it couldn't stop, or the potent poison would erupt.</p><p>Only by breaking through to a higher realm of cultivation or physical strength before a poisonous attack could one survive.</p><p>Cultivating this method was like racing against the poison within.</p><p>Used properly, it was a miraculous technique, but otherwise, it was a path to self-destruction – the black skeleton being a prime example!</p>
