<h1>Chapter 1644: Flowfire Illusiontruth Pool</h1><p>Huashen noticed that the specifications of this palace were comparable to the main body of the Ice Palace, and it was at least an important location within the Fire Phase Hall.</p><p>Fire Rhinoceros Island's formation was unique, dividing the floating island into nine parts.  Each fire dragon corresponded to a Spirit Formation hub.  Presumably, the layout of the Fire Phase Hall also corresponded to the formation.</p><p>Apart from the undisputed central palace, the surrounding halls each had their own functions.</p><p>Huashen swept his gaze around but didn't find any plaques or stone tablets. This place was truly dilapidated, making it impossible to determine the palace's original purpose.</p><p>Looking further ahead, after a slight hesitation, the Fire Jade Centipede had already scurried a considerable distance.</p><p>Huashen quickly flashed forward, catching up to the Fire Jade Centipede without lingering.</p><p>If that treasure was on Fire Rhinoceros Island, it was highly likely, just like the ice disc, to be placed in the central palace of the Fire Phase Hall, at the location of the Spirit Formation hub, using a special formation to replenish its energy.</p><p>The treasure attracting the Fire Jade Centipede was also in the central palace.</p><p>Go to the central palace first, then consider searching other places.</p><p>Passing through the ruins of this palace, the area ahead transformed into vast stretches of jungle. Not only were there Fire Reed Trees, but also various spirit plants with similar functions, including the valuable Spiritfire Trees.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede wound its way through, but consistently followed the direction of the central palace.</p><p>Through the forest they went.</p><p>A river of magma blocked their path.</p><p>Huashen estimated the distance.  Beyond the magma river, they should be entering the central palace of the Fire Phase Hall.  Sure enough, on the opposite bank, the shadows of palace buildings began to appear again, though scattered very sparsely.</p><p>Reaching the opposite bank and traveling for a while longer, Huashen realized that it wasn't that the palace buildings were sparse here, but rather that they had been reduced to ruins by a great battle.  Less than ten percent of the central palace's structures remained.</p><p>It was conceivable that the enemy's main force had attacked the island from the south, resulting in the southern part of Fire Rhinoceros Island being shattered. The Formless Immortal Sect retreated repeatedly, and a decisive battle took place in the central palace.</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>A deafening roar came from ahead.</p><p>The source of the sound was a magma waterfall, located within the central palace area!</p><p>Huashen looked intently and saw crimson flames swirling in the air ahead, brimming with exceptionally violent power.</p><p>This power would indiscriminately attack all intruders. Its might might not be strong enough to obliterate him, but ascending against the magma waterfall would undoubtedly create a massive disturbance, impossible to conceal. Therefore, Huashen didn't choose this shortcut.</p><p>Ruins met his eyes everywhere.</p><p>Huashen's expression grew increasingly grave.</p><p>However, the emotions conveyed by the Fire Jade Centipede grew more and more excited.  It wiggled its head and tail, its speed increasing by another third, transforming into a golden streak, instantly passing through the vast expanse of broken walls and remnants.</p><p>As expected, the central palace was the core of the Fire Phase Hall.  The original density of buildings was comparable to the Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>Moving quickly through the ruins.</p><p>Huashen looked left and right, searching for traces of the remnants of the Fire Phase Hall's grand formation. Deducing the position of the formation's eye through these remnants would undoubtedly be the most efficient method.</p><p>Unfortunately, this place was too devastated. Huashen observed for a long time but couldn't discern any pattern.</p><p>The sound of the magma waterfall grew louder.</p><p>Huashen even saw splashes of crimson magma flying through the air.</p><p>At this moment, the constantly scurrying Fire Jade Centipede finally paused.</p><p>Huashen's heart stirred.  He flashed to the Fire Jade Centipede's side and discovered a fire dragon sculpture carved from fire jade in front of them.  Its posture was majestic, soaring through the flames, its scales shimmering with crimson flames, adding to its imposing presence.</p><p>Unfortunately, the fire dragon sculpture's head and tail had been shattered, leaving only a section of its scarred body.</p><p>Behind the sculpture was a nine-tiered jade staircase. Atop the staircase stood a dilapidated palace. The ancient palace was exposed to the elements on all sides, with a hole in its roof, allowing an unobstructed view of the interior.  Faintly, magnificent carvings could be seen on the walls.</p><p>Judging by the layout, the fire dragon sculpture's position seemed more like a protective spirit beast at the entrance.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede fixated on the fire dragon.</p><p>To be precise, it stared at one of the dragon's claws.  The fire dragon sculpture had only two claws remaining, one raised in the air and the other resting on a sculpted flame base. The Fire Jade Centipede was looking at the second one.</p><p>Huashen was still examining the palace behind the sculpture.  Without seeing the Fire Jade Centipede make any attacking gestures, it unexpectedly rammed its head against the dragon claw.</p><p>An unexpected scene unfolded.</p><p>The instant the Fire Jade Centipede collided with it, the dragon claw suddenly turned transparent.  An opening appeared on the flame base, emitting a red glow, resembling the entrance to a magma well.</p><p>Seeing the Fire Jade Centipede's reckless behavior, Huashen had silently prepared a spell, ready to deal with any sudden situation.  Witnessing this, he couldn't help but be startled, "This is… Does the Fire Phase Hall also have a hidden chamber?"</p><p>As his thoughts flickered, the Fire Jade Centipede vanished in a flash.</p><p>Huashen chose to follow.</p><p>The ancient well was deep.</p><p>The further down they went, the brighter the light became.</p><p>Huashen noticed peculiar runes carved on the walls of the ancient well, clearly indicating a place covered in restrictions, yet neither he nor the Fire Jade Centipede were attacked.</p><p>He imprinted the restrictions in his mind, contemplating them for a while, gradually coming to an understanding.</p><p>These restrictions had no offensive or defensive purpose.</p><p>Combining this with the fire dragon sculpture outside, Huashen concluded that they were used to draw in the abundant Flame Vein power from the outside, converging it towards the bottom of the ancient well.</p><p>There were definitely more than one of these fire dragon sculptures.  The point where their auras converged must be a highly significant location.</p><p>With this discovery, Huashen secretly rejoiced.</p><p>A place where flame energy converges, wasn't it very similar to the ice platform in the Ice Instrument Palace?</p><p>Descending for an unknown depth, they finally reached the bottom, but it wasn't the end of the ancient well.  Another path appeared ahead.  After traveling for a while, they reached the end, where a stone door blocked the way.</p><p>The door was slightly ajar.</p><p>Through the stone door, Huashen could feel the exceptionally rich flame energy inside. The Fire Jade Centipede became even more lively and excited.</p><p>Huashen extended a finger.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was restrained, greatly annoyed.</p><p>Ignoring its protests, Huashen focused his mind and summoned the Snowtreading Divine Saber, using the precious blade to push open the stone door.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>A wave of heat surged out.</p><p>Huashen narrowed his eyes, discovering a vast underground palace behind the door.  The underground palace was bathed in crimson light, with rows of railings carved from fire jade.</p><p>Notably, the ground was in disarray, covered with corpses.</p><p>"In a place like this… how could corpses be preserved until now?"</p><p>Huashen was puzzled.  Upon closer inspection, he realized that these weren't the corpses of cultivators, but rather the remains of puppets crafted from a peculiar type of jade.</p><p>Entering the underground palace, Huashen immediately heard the sound of jade scraping and colliding.</p><p>Huashen's gaze sharpened.  Following the sound, he saw a puppet not far away rise to its feet, two fire jujube-like eyes staring straight at him.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A gust of hot wind rushed towards his face.</p><p>The puppet vanished from its spot, leaving afterimages in the void, its speed astonishing.</p><p>Unfazed, Huashen swung his saber.</p><p>In an instant, several cold beams of light crisscrossed in the void, chillingly cold.</p><p>As if intentionally colliding with the saber light, the puppet shattered into several pieces, instantly cut into sections, the fragments scattering across the ground.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Huashen could withdraw his saber, a crimson shadow flew out from the center of the underground palace, landing on the ground.  The fragments instantly reassembled, and the puppet was completely restored in an instant, continuing to lunge forward.</p><p>Huashen's gaze darkened, his eyes suddenly turning deathly white. He raised his hand, unleashing a chilling Ice Soul Divine Light, freezing the puppet into a block of ice.</p><p>Approaching the ice block and examining it, Huashen said, "So that's how it is."</p><p>This puppet was actually a Talisman Puppet, but it was different from the Talisman Puppets of the Supreme Clarity Palace. Within the Talisman Puppet was a core talisman seal. As long as the seal remained intact, the puppet could be revived, a rather ingenious design.</p><p>The energy that revived the puppet was that crimson shadow.</p><p>Huashen took a step forward, arriving at the railing, taking in the full view of the underground palace.</p><p>There were eight stone doors on the four sides of the underground palace, confirming Huashen's previous conjecture. Outside, each corresponded to eight sculptures, but several stone doors had been destroyed, and the restrictions were severely damaged.</p><p>Surrounding the area were circular corridors that extended downwards, leading to a square spirit pool at the very bottom.</p><p>The spirit pool was less than half the size of the underground palace. The crimson flame energy drawn into the underground palace was entirely concentrated within the spirit pool, incredibly dense. Huashen had to infuse his eyes with True Essence to penetrate the substantial firelight and see the true scene within the spirit pool.</p><p>The crimson flame energy condensed into a pool of flowing fire. After tens of thousands of years, undergoing unknown transformations, the exceptionally pure flowing fire had turned golden.</p><p>Beside the spirit pool stood a short stele, inscribed with the five characters 'Flowfire Illusiontruth Pool'.</p><p>"Flowfire Illusiontruth…"</p><p>Huashen murmured, his gaze shifting upwards, seeing numerous illusory figures within the golden firelight.</p><p>These illusory figures were restrained by invisible restrictions, confined within the area corresponding to the Flowfire Illusiontruth Pool.</p><p>The illusory figures closest to the bottom, near the Flowfire Illusiontruth Pool, were also dyed golden.  The further up they went, the more they gradually transitioned to crimson, their auras weakening progressively, forming distinct layers.</p><p>Correspondingly, there were layers of corridors around the outside.</p><p>Each corridor had a balcony extending outwards. Although there were no meditation mats, it was clear that these were intended for cultivators, who could cultivate here and capture the illusory figures within.</p><p>The higher the cultivation, the deeper the position.</p><p>"It seems like a place for artificially nurturing spirit phantoms…"</p><p>Huashen observed the illusory figures, recognizing them as similar to fire spirits.</p><p>However, they were different from naturally born fire spirits. Their eyes were vacant, allowing themselves to be bound by the restrictions above the Flowfire Illusiontruth Pool, their behavior mechanical, lacking even the thought of escaping their prison or yearning for freedom, almost like inanimate objects.</p><p>Even the golden illusory figures closest to the Flowfire Illusiontruth Pool were the same.</p><p>Recalling the behavior of the Talisman Puppet earlier, only when the crimson shadow merged with the Talisman Puppet would it be imbued with the intent to fight.</p><p>This was highly abnormal, a result deliberately engineered by the creator of the spirit pool.</p><p>Fire spirits certainly weren't limited to merging with Talisman Puppets; they had many other wonderful uses.</p><p>These fire spirits were easier for disciples to subdue, and then their sentience could be cultivated using secret techniques, greatly reducing the possibility of betrayal.  Moreover, the restrictions of the spirit pool were incredibly profound, their potential perhaps no less than naturally born fire spirits, allowing for mass cultivation, one for each person.</p><p>Even a casual glance revealed the astonishing foundation of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>While Huashen clicked his tongue in admiration, he was also quite disappointed. This place was far from what he had envisioned. What attracted the Fire Jade Centipede wasn't a treasure, but fire spirits.</p><p>Fire spirits were born from the purest crimson flame energy. Their most valuable aspect was their undeveloped sentience. They could be directly consumed without worrying about backlash from the fire spirits, undoubtedly a great tonic. No wonder the Fire Jade Centipede was so eager.</p><p>Huashen released the restriction.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede couldn't wait any longer.  Unafraid of the impact of the crimson flame energy within the spirit pool, it directly charged into the group of fire spirits, starting from the uppermost layer, burrowing into the body of a crimson fire spirit.</p><p>That fire spirit quickly withered and vanished.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede reappeared, its aura visibly enhanced, and it unhesitatingly pounced on another.</p><p>The group of fire spirits stirred. They lacked sentience and wouldn't attack en masse. Only the one under attack would instinctively retaliate.</p><p>But the Fire Jade Centipede was already a Fourth Transformation spirit insect, and this level of retaliation couldn't harm it.</p><p>Huashen watched the Fire Jade Centipede hunt freely, then shifted his gaze to the Flowfire Illusiontruth Pool, "What a pity. The crimson flame energy accumulated here for tens of thousands of years is no longer what it once was.  If my true body came to absorb it, it could also gain considerable benefits. When my true body returns from Emperor Bestowal Mountain, I wonder if it will still be here…"</p><p>He hadn't forgotten his mission.</p><p>But after several attempts, the Fire Jade Centipede was only concerned with feasting, unwilling to stop until it was full, showing no interest in other treasures, and no intention of continuing the treasure hunt.</p><p>Helpless, Huashen thought to himself, did this mean that the fire-type supreme treasure wasn't here? Otherwise, the Fire Jade Centipede wouldn't be behaving this way.</p><p>Let it eat its fill.  Huashen himself began to get busy.</p><p>Although he hadn't found the supreme treasure, the restrictions of the underground palace were relatively intact.  Huashen noticed that some of the restrictions didn't belong to the underground palace.  It was likely that they were part of the Fire Phase Hall's grand formation. He planned to deduce the location of the formation eye from this.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang's skills in this area weren't weak, it still took him a great deal of effort to gradually gain some understanding and follow the movement of the formation.</p><p>…</p><p>While Huashen was busy.</p><p>In an unknown valley.</p><p>The mountain wind blew, light and shadow swayed, and three figures suddenly appeared.  It was Poison King and his two companions.</p><p>"This should be the final battleground…"</p><p>Poison King looked around, his gaze settling on the valley, his tone certain.</p><p>They had been attracted by the phenomenon in the Ice Instrument Palace and rushed here without stopping. Unexpectedly, they discovered traces of a battle midway and followed them to this valley.  Important information had been deliberately erased, but from the traces, it could be determined that both sides of the battle were powerful.</p><p>In fact, there were no weaklings within the legacy realm now.</p><p>"Three people! One side had help, the other fought alone. The outcome doesn't seem very good!" Old Devil Fan judged.</p><p>But Master Huaixin had a different opinion. He kept his eyes closed, his aura steady, as if meditating. Suddenly, his nostrils twitched, and he spoke, "Something's strange. Both sides might have been a single person. Those two auras are distinct, yet seem connected."</p><p>Master Huaixin's spiritual sense was extremely keen, discerning subtle differences, approaching the truth.</p><p>This was indeed the battlefield between Su Zinan and Old Man Yanshan.</p><p>After Su Zinan succeeded, although he had cleaned up, because he was concerned about the opportunities within the Immortal Palace and was also attracted by the phenomenon in the Ice Instrument Palace, there were inevitably some imperfections.</p><p>He overlooked some clues, which Master Huaixin detected.</p><p>Poison King trusted Master Huaixin's abilities, "Master, you mean, a spirit slave, puppet, or avatar?"</p><p>The corner of Old Devil Fan's eye twitched. He scoffed, "Old monk, did you see clearly? That person's opponent wasn't weak. If he truly was alone, relying entirely on his own strength, then his power… hmph…"</p><p>The argument yielded no conclusion.</p><p>Poison King shifted his gaze, seeing the crimson glow in the northeast direction, the shadow of the floating island faintly visible. He said softly, "They have a long-standing grudge. Are they fighting over something?"</p><p>"The victor has been decided. Even if there are treasures, they won't be yours!"</p><p>Old Devil Fan snorted coldly, pointing at Emperor Bestowal Mountain, impatiently saying, "Several points of light and shadow are flickering on the mountain, clearly indicating that people are ascending. The pillar of light phenomenon also erupted near this mountain. If we delay any further, there will only be leftovers!"</p><p>Poison King also saw the phenomenon on Emperor Bestowal Mountain, hesitating, "That floating island is shrouded in flames, accumulated for tens of thousands of years. There should be fire poison accumulated, which would be of great use to me.  Why don't the two of you go ahead, and I'll join you on the mountain after I absorb the fire poison."</p>
