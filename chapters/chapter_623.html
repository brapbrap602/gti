<h1>Chapter 615: Darkness Without, Light Within</h1><p>‘Plip…plop…’</p><p>The rain outside intensified, leaking through the roof.  A drip fell directly onto Qin Sang’s shoulder.</p><p>Ya Gu quickly reached out, shielding Qin Sang, and helped him move. Then, taking a piece of wood from the fire pit, she wrote on the ground: “When you first saw me, your eyes held no disgust.”</p><p>Then, Ya Gu looked up at Qin Sang.  In the firelight, her eyes shone brightly.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the characters Ya Gu had written.  The script was delicate.  Her grandmother had taught her to read and write, and later, in her solitude, she practiced, cherishing the memory of her grandmother.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t learned the local script or language, yet he recognized these characters; they were the same as those used in Xiao Han.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang could easily understand the language spoken by the villagers of Qianhu Village, although the accent differed slightly from that of Xiao Han.  It was similar to the difference between the official language and dialects in his previous life.</p><p>This discovery startled Qin Sang.</p><p>In his previous life, a small land could develop thousands of languages.  The vast expanse of the cultivation world couldn't possibly have only one language.  Could he still be within the borders of Xiao Han, unable to escape Dongyang Bo's control?</p><p>Qin Sang, who had been somewhat relaxed, immediately became tense again.  He instructed Ya Gu not to see any outsiders to avoid leaks and reduce the risk of exposure.</p><p>Only Ya Gu and the old witch doctor had seen him and knew he was an amputee.</p><p>The Qianhu villagers called this place Xijiang.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the geographical map of Xiao Han. He didn't remember any place called Xijiang.  If considering location, the western part of Xiao Han was the territory of the Tianyao Hill demon cultivators, and all the mortals had been relocated.</p><p>The Tianxing League was monolithic; there was no division called Xijiang.</p><p>Nor had Qin Sang heard of any place that worshipped a witch god.</p><p>However, mortals had limited knowledge. To understand exactly where this place was, he needed to meet a cultivator.</p><p>“When you first saw me, your eyes held no disgust.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Although he hadn't directly asked, through his time here and snippets of conversations overheard, he had learned about Ya Gu's past.</p><p>Ya Gu would turn sixteen in a few days.</p><p>As a fellow villager, and with her father, a renowned warrior and the strongest man in Qianhu Village, having been chosen to succeed as the next village chief, Ya Gu should have lived in the spacious, bright stilt houses of the village. Yet, since birth, she had lived in a thatched hut in the back mountains.</p><p>The reason was the title 'ill-omened star'.</p><p>On the day of Ya Gu's birth, her father led a hunting party that was ambushed by wild beasts, resulting in almost total annihilation.  Her mother died three days after giving birth, following her husband.</p><p>Combined with a birthmark that made her appear fierce, rumors spread that she was an evil spirit reincarnated, having already killed her parents and destined to kill the whole village, earning her the title of 'ill-omened star', a fate that would condemn her to be drowned in the river.</p><p>Later, Ya Gu's only remaining relative, her grandmother, known as ‘Grandma’ in Xijiang, took Ya Gu away from the village, protecting her in the back mountains.</p><p>But misfortune continued. At age three, Ya Gu was found to be mute.  At seven, another accident claimed her grandmother's life, right before Ya Gu's eyes.</p><p>Since then, the title 'ill-omened star' had been inextricably linked to Ya Gu. Everyone called her Ya Gu; her real name was forgotten.</p><p>Although no one had died because of Ya Gu in the past ten years, the villagers still wouldn't allow her to return.  Seven-year-old Ya Gu had lived alone in the back mountains ever since.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how a child could have endured it.</p><p>Fortunately, the mountain where Qianhu Village was located had no wild beasts. The village patrolled the river below by boat day and night, ensuring the safety of the back mountains.</p><p>Furthermore, the village elders were reasonable and, out of respect for the deceased elders, regularly provided for Ya Gu.  The witch doctor, in particular, had some connection with Ya Gu's grandmother and was especially kind to her.</p><p>But even they didn't dare to defy public opinion and bring Ya Gu back to the village.</p><p>Despite all the hardships, Ya Gu harbored no resentment. Her eyes were clear and pure.</p><p>She didn't succumb to despair. Self-reliant and strong, from the age of twelve, she supported herself through labor and weaving bamboo crafts, refusing charity.</p><p>Qin Sang, a man who has seen much of the world, recognized the inherent innocence and naivety in the mute girl.  He saw her longing for acceptance and companionship, her persistent hope for connection despite the unkind words of other girls.  The passage on the ground perfectly revealed the girl's true heart. She saw in Qin Sang a glimmer of hope for acceptance.</p><p>Seeing the girl's hopeful and trusting gaze, Qin Sang couldn't bring himself to say much.  The girl didn't know that despite his youthful appearance, he was a cultivator over a hundred years old, a man who had encountered countless genuine evil spirits; a simple birthmark held no fear for him.  Qin Sang was long past judging people by their appearance.</p><p>Could even the most beautiful face compare to the true beauty of Chen Yan and Granny Jing? Could any ugliness surpass the ugliness of the human heart? In his eyes, the mute girl was more beautiful than those outwardly attractive girls. Such a kind girl deserved heaven's favor.</p><p>"Everything will be alright!" Qin Sang said.</p><p>…</p><p>Ordinary herbs were ineffective against his injury, but Qin Sang, unwilling to hurt the mute girl's feelings, drank them all. After she helped him to rest, she returned to her weaving by the firelight. The Witch God Festival was approaching, and every piece of finished work counted. Through the thin curtain, Qin Sang saw her slender figure working diligently by the fire.  After a while, he closed his eyes to meditate.</p><p>The rain fell throughout the night, finally subsiding near dawn, leaving only a soft drizzle.  As Qin Sang lay in bed, seemingly asleep, he suddenly opened his eyes, a look of surprise in them. He had expected it to take two more days, but his recovery was faster than anticipated; a sliver of his spiritual sense had returned.</p><p>"I should be able to open the Qianjun Ring!"</p><p>Carefully controlling that small amount of spiritual sense, he touched the ring, managing to open it. Quickly taking out a few items, his spiritual sense was exhausted again.  A sharp pain shot through his head.</p><p>Enduring the pain, he fumbled for a jade bottle containing pills to restore his spiritual sense.  He eagerly opened it, swallowed several pills, and the pain lessened significantly. After meditating for an hour, his spiritual sense recovered slightly more.  He then opened the corpse puppet bag and summoned the transformed Flying Night Rakshasa. He felt a profound sense of relief.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa's appearance had drastically changed.  It resembled the most ferocious demon, its flesh black and gleaming with a metallic sheen, like forged black iron, containing terrifying power.  This was the true Flying Night Rakshasa!</p>
