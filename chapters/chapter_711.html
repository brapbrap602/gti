<h1>Chapter 703: The Signal</h1><p>“Perhaps,” the stout cultivator said with a wry smile. “The sea surrounding the island is vast. Patrolling the entire area isn't easy and will take a lot of time.  Do we split up or stick together?”</p><p>“I believe it's best to stay together, as we did on the way here. We can look out for each other and search more thoroughly,” the scholar in blue said calmly.</p><p>“Good! Let's do that!” the stout cultivator readily agreed. “Time is of the essence. Let's not waste any more time and get moving.”</p><p>Just as they were about to set off, the gaunt old man suddenly turned his head and asked with a frown, “Qin Sang, what are you doing?”</p><p>Only then did the others notice that while they were discussing the patrol, Qin Sang had been squatting at the edge of the cold mist, holding a blade of grass frozen into an ice shard, seemingly focused on something.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, pulling the grass from the ground. “Do you find this cold mist peculiar? When I used my True Essence to dispel it, it didn't feel like pure cold air, but more like the sensation of True Essence being burned by spiritual fire.  Moreover, I’ve discovered something strange. Look…”</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang’s True Essence flickered at his fingertips, melting the ice on the blade of grass.</p><p>Then, the grass visibly faded from green, eventually turning into black ash.  Qin Sang flicked his hand, and the ash scattered.</p><p>Everyone was amazed by this scene.</p><p>“Qin Sang’s observation is indeed meticulous. I've been here once before, yet I failed to notice this peculiarity of the cold mist,” the stout cultivator said, bending down to pluck a blade of grass and rubbing it into ash in his palm.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled but remained silent.</p><p>A female cultivator chopped down an ice-covered tree. After the ice melted, the same thing happened.</p><p>Witnessing this strange phenomenon, everyone was baffled.</p><p>“There’s something odd about this cold mist.  Ordinary cold air would only freeze plants to death, not turn them into ash,” the female cultivator said seriously.</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, the stout cultivator could only offer a wry smile. "I've already sworn a Heart Devil Oath. Everything I said before is true. You still don't believe me.  I didn't encounter this situation after entering the cave, and I wouldn't dare exhaust my True Essence inside, allowing the cold mist to invade my body. If you feel your True Essence depleting too quickly, simply retreat."</p><p>“Perhaps it's the peculiarity of the cold mist that attracted the Nascent Soul ancestor to establish a cave dwelling here," someone sighed.</p><p>Unable to discern the reason, they temporarily abandoned their investigation, concealed themselves, left the island, and began patrolling the surrounding waters.</p><p>They searched meticulously, even checking beneath the surface of the sea.</p><p>Upon returning to the island, they discovered that the cold mist had expanded outward.  Without wasting any more time, they discussed briefly, jointly set up a warning formation, and headed towards the cave entrance.</p><p>The restriction at the cave entrance seemed to be solely for containing the cold mist and didn’t impede their entry.</p><p>Stone steps had been carved inside the cave.  Dense cold mist obscured their vision, making it impossible to see anything.</p><p>The stout cultivator led the way, followed by the others in pairs. Qin Sang volunteered to bring up the rear with the gaunt old man. They maintained a close enough distance to vaguely see each other’s movements within the mist.</p><p>The moment they entered the cave, everyone let out a soft gasp.</p><p>The cold mist within the cave was far more potent than outside. Shivering, they quickly circulated their True Essence. Feeling the rapid depletion of their True Essence, they urged the stout cultivator to move faster.</p><p>The stout cultivator didn't hesitate, quickly walking deeper into the cave, with everyone close behind.</p><p>The cave was winding, becoming more spacious the further they went. They spread out slightly, each wielding their magical treasures, cautiously looking into the depths of the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang brought out the Ten Yama Banners, all three of them.</p><p>The three banners formed a formation, which Qin Sang then absorbed into his palm. The appearance and disappearance of the demonic fire aura were brief, but the others still noticed something unusual.</p><p>Someone couldn’t help but glance at him, but not seeing the true form of the Ten Yama Banners, they weren't sure and looked away.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, your treasure seems rather extraordinary,” Qin Sang heard the gaunt old man’s voice transmission.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways and said calmly, “You flatter me, Fellow Daoist. My cultivation is the lowest among us. I only reached Foundation Establishment a few years ago.  Fortunately, I possess a reasonably powerful treasure, which allows me to maintain a foothold in the Demonic Sea. Treasures are ultimately external; cultivation is the foundation.”</p><p>Qin Sang was speaking the truth. The gaunt old man chuckled and didn't say anything more.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang held the Ten Yama Banners in his hand, a wisp of Nine Nether Demonic Fire coiling around his fingers. His expression remained unchanged.</p><p>However, his mind was filled with doubts.</p><p>Just now, when he deployed the Ten Yama Banners and secretly activated the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, he noticed that the demonic fire was behaving differently than usual. It seemed to sense something and showed signs of agitation.</p><p>He had possessed the Nine Nether Demonic Fire for so long, and this was the first time this had happened.</p><p>Qin Sang curled his fingers, trying his best to soothe it, but the demonic fire remained restless. This wasn’t the excitement of encountering its own kind; it felt more like encountering a rival and being eager to destroy it.</p><p>Previously, the strongest opponent Qin Sang had encountered who wielded spiritual fire was the Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Azure Yang Demonic Sect.</p><p>That person cultivated Azure Yang Demonic Fire, and Qin Sang fought him using the Nine Nether Demonic Fire. Back then, the demonic fire hadn’t reacted like this.</p><p>Was it because that fire was too weak, and the Nine Nether Demonic Fire looked down on it?</p><p>“Could there be some kind of spiritual fire hidden in the depths of this cold mist, even stronger than Wu Youdao's Azure Yang Demonic Fire?” Qin Sang pondered. “Do these powerful spiritual fires sense each other's presence when they are close? It’s a pity I didn't bring the Ten Yama Banners with me when I infiltrated the Azure Yang Demonic Sect. Otherwise, their ancestral Sacred Fire should have piqued the interest of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, and I could have tested it then…”</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang's expression turned serious as he stared at the end of the cave, his eyes flickering.</p><p>If a spiritual fire comparable to the ancestral Sacred Fire was truly hidden within, it would explain why even the hide of a Transformation stage demon beast decayed so quickly.</p><p>But similarly, such a dangerous place was no place for Foundation Establishment cultivators like them.</p><p>“This person is hiding something,”  Qin Sang thought. He didn't believe the stout cultivator would honestly reveal everything he knew. There must be something he was concealing, though it might not necessarily be the spiritual fire.</p><p>Faced with such immense power, no tricks would work. The stout cultivator had entered himself; if he dared to have any designs on the spiritual fire, he wouldn't escape either.</p><p>But Qin Sang couldn't confirm his suspicions. The Nine Nether Demonic Fire was inanimate and couldn't provide clear information.</p><p>“For now, the power of the cold mist is manageable. Let’s see what kind of restriction guards the first layer of the cave dwelling,” Qin Sang muttered to himself, withdrawing the demonic fire into the banners and fixing his gaze on the stout cultivator’s back.</p>
