<h1>Chapter 136, Essential Spirit Nourishing Sword Chapter</h1><p>The Profound Tortoise Array is designed to both conceal and defend. It suits Qin Sang's needs perfectly. After thanking Elder Yu, Qin Sang puts away the array flags.</p><p>Elder Yu gets up to go to the inner hall. He takes out the jade register and inscribes Qin Sang's name in the jade register of Foundation Establishment stage disciples.</p><p>As soon as the name is written, the jade register emits a faint glow, and a jade belt appears.</p><p>He changes the Foundation Establishment stage disciple belt, and can now enjoy the benefits of Foundation Establishment stage disciples. One of the things Qin Sang looks forward to most is selecting a cultivation technique from the Pagoda Peak collection. New Foundation Establishment disciples can choose one technique to cultivate for free within a month.</p><p>"These five medium-grade spirit stones are a reward from the sect to Foundation Establishment stage disciples. You only get them once, but you can choose spirit stones, spirit herbs, and other items every year. The value is not bad. The sect also awards a cave abode, but since Junior Brother Qin has chosen to cultivate outside, you can go directly to the Spirit Beast Hall. As per sect rules, Foundation Establishment stage disciples do not have to do chores. However, the sect has various tasks that Qi Condensation stage disciples cannot complete. The rewards are quite generous, with the Ancient Immortal Battlefield being the most lucrative. If Junior Brother is interested, you can take on some tasks. However, if the sect issues an order, you must complete it diligently. Do not disobey for any reason. Otherwise, you will be charged with betrayal. Junior Brother Qin should be careful in the future…"</p><p>Elder Yu speaks at length about the rights and obligations of Foundation Establishment stage disciples.</p><p>Compared to Qi Condensation, Shaohua Mountain treats Foundation Establishment stage disciples extremely generously. With the exception of the rare sect orders, Foundation Establishment stage disciples are free to do as they please.</p><p>If they are short on funds, they can go to the Main Peak and find something to do.</p><p>If they want to go into seclusion, they can close their cave abode and basically no one will bother them.</p><p>When trying to reach the Golden Core stage, the sect provides free spirit items to assist in forming the golden core. Although they are not the best items, they are treasures that independent cultivators yearn for but cannot obtain.</p><p>The difference in a single level leads to a world of difference in status. Qin Sang cannot help but sigh internally.</p><p>The two continue to chat for a while. Qin Sang has learned most of what he needs to know. Since Elder Yu knows him inside and out, he stops pretending and bows his hands. "I didn't want to bother Senior Brother Elder any further, but I have little knowledge and know little about cultivation beyond the Foundation Establishment stage. I have not been able to decide which technique to choose. Please, Senior Brother Elder, do not hesitate to give me your advice!"</p><p>Elder Yu asks in reply, "Does Junior Brother Qin have any ideas?"</p><p>Qin Sang has thought about this for a long time, of course. The jade Buddha protects his spirit. After it was taken, the root of his energy is the only thing that has been affected. He must mend his root of energy or he can never reach Golden Core.</p><p>"Are there any techniques that can replenish essence qi and restore my root of energy?"</p><p>Elder Yu looks at Qin Sang deeply, seemingly expecting this information. "Pagoda Peak does have a few techniques to mend the root of energy…"</p><p>Before Qin Sang can show any joy, Elder Yu suddenly changes his tone. "But Junior Brother Qin, your situation is different from others. The most fundamental essence qi has been lost. The only things that can mend your root of energy are natural treasures born from the heavens and earth. These techniques are not as effective as Nine Yang Pills, so Junior Brother Qin should not waste his time on them."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression stiffens. He shakes his head with a wry smile, having expected this. But he cannot help but feel disappointed.</p><p>"Senior Brother Elder, you know my talent. But I am not willing to give up. Are there any techniques that can help me touch the threshold of the Golden Core stage before I die?"</p><p>Elder Yu comforts Qin Sang for a few sentences before saying, "Since Junior Brother Qin has this desire, he must choose a technique that is relatively easy to progress in. However, most of these techniques have no self-preservation divine abilities. If you do not have other means of winning in a battle, you will definitely lose in the future. If you encounter an opponent with similar power, you will have to run away. This flaw is not apparent during normal times. But if you go on a journey and are competing with others for opportunities, you may not be qualified to even intervene. You will only regret it if you are unable to do so. Pagoda Peak has techniques like 'Essence Core Technique' and 'Thoughtless Technique'. These are all suitable if Junior Brother Qin is willing to accept them."</p><p>Qin Sang furrows his brows, silently worrying about his own root of energy having been damaged. His qi sea is already ten percent smaller than other cultivators of the same level. If he chooses such techniques, how will he ever be able to fight with others?</p><p>Cultivation is not about just cultivating in seclusion. Many times, it is necessary to fight with others.</p><p>For example, to reach Golden Core, besides naturally talented Heaven Spirit Roots, who does not spend many years on journeys, seizing any opportunity to increase their chances of reaching Golden Core?</p><p>Does this mean that in the future, he will only be able to hide his head and flinch from a challenge, giving up opportunities for free?</p><p>But Qin Sang is not naive. He understands that cultivating powerful divine abilities that can win battles is extremely difficult. They are indeed not suitable for him.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang realized something. He asked, “Sect Master Senior, ever since I joined Shaohua Mountain on the first day, I’ve often heard the legend of Senior Qing Zhu. It’s said that Senior Qing Zhu’s talent was nothing special, but his cultivation speed was extremely fast. And his strength wasn’t bad either. I wonder what kind of cultivation method Senior Qing Zhu practiced?”</p><p>“You mean that cultivation method!”</p><p>To Qin Sang’s surprise, Sect Master Yu’s expression when he mentioned Senior Qing Zhu’s cultivation method was just as fearful as Senior Brother Wen’s had been.</p><p>“That cultivation method is called the ‘Divine Principle of Nurturing the Sword with Divine Intent’. Other than Senior Qing Zhu, no one else on Shaohua Mountain has mastered it—and not just because the cultivation method is only a fragment. A bigger reason is that this cultivation method is terrifyingly demanding of the cultivator. It’s absolutely not something an ordinary person can do. Junior Brother Qin, go take a look at the Pagoda Peak and you’ll understand why.”</p><p>His words piqued Qin Sang’s curiosity even more.</p><p>The words “Divine Intent” appearing in the cultivation method’s name especially made his heart race and his thoughts run wild.</p><p>Qin Sang chatted with Sect Master Yu on the Sect Master Peak for a long time, but the jade register on the table remained motionless.</p><p>Sect Master Yu gave Qin Sang a strange look and said in an awkward tone, “No Golden Core Mentor is willing to accept Junior Brother Qin as their disciple. Uncle-Master Mo hasn’t responded either… But Junior Brother Qin, don’t get discouraged. There are quite a few fellow disciples who cultivate alone. As long as you cultivate diligently, you’ll still stand out and be in the eyes of the mentors.”</p><p>Each Golden Core Immortal’s cave府 has a copy of this jade register.</p><p>When a Foundation Establishment disciple’s name is added to the jade register, the other jade registers will also receive this information. If a Golden Core Immortal happens to see it and thinks that the child is very talented, they will take that child as their disciple.</p><p>While it doesn’t necessarily mean that they will receive personal guidance from a Golden Core Immortal, it’s still much better than fumbling around on their own.</p><p>Qin Sang had a premonition about this and wasn’t particularly disappointed. But he felt that Sect Master Yu’s attitude had subtly cooled. With a sigh, he said goodbye to Sect Master Yu and returned to the Pagoda Peak.</p><p>Upon arriving in the hall where the cultivation methods and magic incantations were stored, Qin Sang bumped into an acquaintance: the Gong surnamed cultivator who’d refused to be a cauldron.</p>
