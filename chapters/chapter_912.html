<h1>Chapter 904:  A Desperate Strike</h1><p>Chapter 904:  A Desperate Strike</p><p>“What’s that!”</p><p>A human cultivator at the Golden Core stage shouted, pointing at the ground.</p><p>Everyone saw the exposed stone steps, clearly not recently built.  They and the Lan Dou Sect coexisted on Lan Dou Island; even Dong Ming Island was discovered by their ancestors and the Lan Dou Sect together. Yet no one knew of this hidden secret on the island.</p><p>“What did those Wu tribe people take?”</p><p>They exchanged glances, and simultaneously shouted: “Chase!”</p><p>The two sides chased each other through the jungle.  Sword light and blade energy rose and fell, a relentless storm of attacks, but all were blocked by the Beast King Banner.</p><p>Soon, they passed through the Dark Thunderwood forest. Seeing that the formation was intact, the Wu cultivators relaxed. At the same time, the human Golden Core cultivators saw the edge of the array and the billowing black smoke!</p><p>“No good, they infiltrated from there! That person is escaping, stop him!”</p><p>Someone pointed at the cloaked figure, shouting urgently.</p><p>But the Beast King Banner and the Wu cultivators stood between them; it was impossible to destroy the formation and stop the cloaked figure.</p><p>The cloaked figure glanced back, sneered. The formation was close at hand.  Entering it, using the corrosive smoke passage to escape, and then retracting the outer formation to sever the passage, they could easily shake off their pursuers.</p><p>Luring these people here might not be a bad thing; the senior brother could easily escape. By the time these people circled around to the exit of Dong Ming Island and emerged, they would have long since vanished.</p><p>The only thing exposed this time was the Beast King Banner. However, many Wu clans possessed the Beast King Banner, so the Lan Dou Sect wouldn't be able to investigate.</p><p>The cloaked figure plotted their next move, feeling confident of victory, and plunged towards the formation.</p><p>Then, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Next to the formation, an ordinary Dark Thunderwood, without warning, suddenly emitted a dazzling sword light. The tree trembled slightly before splitting in two, falling to the ground.</p><p>The sword light rapidly expanded in the cloaked figure's eyes, like a grim reaper, bringing the scent of death.</p><p>Caught completely off guard, the cloaked figure was both shocked and furious. He never expected anyone to be in ambush, and none of them had detected their presence.</p><p>The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind!</p><p>This thought crossed the cloaked figure's mind, but he couldn't understand how their perfect plan, executed so smoothly, could have gone wrong.</p><p>But now wasn't the time for such reflections.</p><p>“Senior brother, watch out!”</p><p>A cry of alarm came from his junior brothers.</p><p>The cloaked cultivator was a seasoned veteran; although shocked and furious, his face remained calm. He quickly pinched a spell, spitting out a blue light.  </p><p>The light contained a command arrow.</p><p>With a sharp clang, the arrow flashed, blocking the sword light at the last moment.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the sword light flickered and split into a dozen bright sword beams, each extremely sharp, indistinguishable from the others, easily bypassing the arrow and shooting towards him.</p><p>“Sword light division!”</p><p>The cloaked figure was furious, his back stiff, a chill running down his spine.  Only exceptional human sword cultivators could achieve such mastery. He had met his lifelong nemesis!</p><p>Remaining calm in crisis, the cloaked figure focused his mind, and an insect flew out from his body – the dragonfly-shaped insect, his life essence.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>As soon as the insect appeared, the cloaked figure's face turned pale, and he spat out a mouthful of blood onto it.</p><p>The insect let out a sharp ‘buzz’, its body flashing with blood light, and then transformed into a huge shadow twice the height of a man, completely shielding the cloaked figure.</p><p>At the same time, the cloaked figure retreated rapidly.  He knew that as long as his life essence blocked the opponent, and allowed him to retreat into the Beast King Banner formation, the attacker could no longer harm him.</p><p>However, his life essence might be injured.</p><p>He had already forcefully stimulated its potential with his blood; if it were seriously injured again, it would take decades to recover.</p><p>But compared to his life, these were unimportant.</p><p>The sword beams were about to be blocked by the insect shadow.</p><p>Then, an unbelievable scene unfolded. A small, insignificant blue light suddenly appeared, unbelievably fast, overtaking the sword beams to strike the insect shadow directly.  It was the Star Snail.</p><p>Before the cloaked figure could react, a ‘popping’ sound came from within the insect shadow. The huge shadow shattered, and his life essence met its demise under the Star Snail, leaving only a cloud of blood mist, its body destroyed without a trace.</p><p>The man in black's soul-linked insect familiar died, causing him excruciating pain that ripped through his spirit.  He cried out, his face turning ashen.  The death of the familiar severely wounded its master.</p><p>"It was you..."</p><p>He pointed a trembling finger at the figure beside the flag array, his eyes bloodshot. He recognized the treasure – the very thing that had instantly killed his fourth junior brother.</p><p>"It was,"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.</p><p>The star snail, moving as fast as the sword light, struck down.</p><p>Even though mortally wounded, the man in black desperately fought for survival. He wildly backpedaled, hair disheveled, raving, seemingly casting a life-saving spell.</p><p>Then, a sudden change.</p><p>As the man in black passed a Dark Thunderwood tree, an exquisitely beautiful butterfly appeared.  With a beat of its wings, countless incredibly thin but powerful lightning bolts shot out, striking the man in black's back.</p><p>Though weak, the Sky Eye Butterfly, a three-stage spirit insect, unleashed a devastating attack that even the man in black couldn’t withstand. Already near death and struggling against Qin Sang's attack, he had no chance to defend against this ambush.  Who could have guessed the butterfly's incredible ability to remain hidden, lurking until the final moment to deliver a fatal blow?</p><p>The man in black's protective aura shattered under the lightning. His body stiffened, then the star snail pierced him, killing him instantly.</p><p>He desperately tried to see his killer, but only saw a butterfly's shadow.</p><p>“Sky Eye Butterfly! No, it's not, it doesn't…”</p><p>This was his final thought.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly quickly flitted around the man in black’s waist, snatching his storage pouch before flying into Qin Sang's arms.  Overjoyed at seeing its true master, it excitedly fluttered its wings, eager to dance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the man in black’s junior brothers frantically rushed to his aid.  They were close, but Qin Sang acted decisively and swiftly, leaving them no chance to intervene.</p><p>Qin Sang calmed the excited butterfly, recalled the star snail, and unleashed a powerful sword strike before retreating into the flag array amidst cries of rage.  Then, with a powerful leap, she vanished into the smoky passage.</p>
