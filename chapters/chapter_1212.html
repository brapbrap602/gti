<h1>Chapter 1204: Supreme-Grade Magical Treasure</h1><p>*Boom…*</p><p>The raging waves surged into the sky.</p><p>An unknown fluctuation affected the seal, which in turn rippled through the entire space, forming a terrifying storm. Its momentum was almost comparable to the storm belt at the outer edges of the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang shielded himself and flew to Fat Chicken’s side, inspecting the restrictions at the entrance of the secret realm to ensure the fluctuations wouldn’t spread outward.</p><p>“Master, could there be a great demon causing chaos inside?” Fat Chicken asked with concern.</p><p>It had heard Qin Sang mention that the altar was connected to a sealed space. If the seal was broken, those inside had likely already escaped. So why was there such a terrifying phenomenon now?</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head lightly.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly perched on Qin Sang’s shoulder, activating its Heavenly Eye to gaze intently at the seal beneath the water.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang suddenly opened the exit of the secret realm and flew out, looking toward the direction of the Abyssal Ruins’ entrance.</p><p>At this moment, the spiritual tide formed by the tremors of the Abyssal Ruins surged along the Heavenly Scar, impacting everything around it. Although Qin Sang’s location was farther away, he could still feel the tail end of the storm.</p><p>A hurricane swept toward him, causing the leaves in the forest to rustle and whip violently.</p><p>The already unstable fragments of ancient restrictions in the surroundings grew even more restless.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately deduced the cause. “The source is the entrance to the Abyssal Ruins! As expected, this is caused by the tremors of the Sin God Palace!”</p><p>Before the Purple Palace emerged, spiritual tide phenomena would appear throughout the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>In comparison, the Sin God Palace’s disturbances were much smaller.</p><p>It was said that tremors would only occur periodically. Even if the tremors surged out of the Abyssal Ruins, they could be blocked by a grand formation to prevent the fluctuations from destroying other ancient restrictions and secret realms within the Heavenly Scar, avoiding a chain reaction.</p><p>“Is the seal here directly connected to the Abyssal Ruins? Or are nearby secret realms also affected by the tremors of the Sin God Palace, causing this phenomenon?”</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the secret realm, watching the increasingly violent storm.</p><p>After discovering that the underwater restrictions were connected to an unknown sealed space, Qin Sang had speculated that the sealed space might be related to the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>After all, this place was so close to the entrance of the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>The danger of the Abyssal Ruins was comparable to the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>This was precisely why Qin Sang had been so cautious, waiting until the Ebony Sword was fully refined before exploring the sealed space.</p><p>If he had only been one or two-tenths certain before, seeing the phenomenon in the secret realm now made him fifty percent certain.</p><p>“Whether the other side is the Abyssal Ruins or not, I’ll only know after entering…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered thoughtfully.</p><p>Several hours later, the storm finally showed signs of weakening, though it was far from subsiding. Its momentum was merely less intense than before.</p><p>Then it continued like this, with no telling how long it would take to calm down.</p><p>At this moment, at the entrance of the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>The other cultivators felt the pressure on them lessen slightly.</p><p>The High-Crowned Daoist and the white-haired elder sensed the change and exchanged a glance. Their hand seals shifted simultaneously, and the light barrier transformed, resembling an inverted jade bowl, becoming even more stable.</p><p>Knowing that the most violent wave of tremors had passed, everyone’s expressions relaxed a little.</p><p>The two Nascent Soul cultivators were able to spare some attention, habitually sensing their surroundings to confirm nothing was amiss. They then continued to activate the spiritual formation, waiting for the Sin God Palace to calm down.</p><p>At that very moment, in a nearby crevice, a strange fluctuation appeared and silently dissipated, instantly returning to calm without a trace of movement.</p><p>The two Nascent Soul cultivators at the entrance of the Abyssal Ruins were completely unaware.</p><p>At the main hall of the Corpse Refining Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the hall and casually set up a layer of restrictions to block the storm.</p><p>Although the fluctuations from the sealed space had weakened, Qin Sang still had no intention of entering.</p><p>He knew that, like the Purple Palace, the tremors of the Sin God Palace would not subside overnight. So he was in no hurry, prepared to continue waiting for the Ebony Sword.</p><p>…</p><p>Cultivating in the midst of the storm, unmoving like a mountain.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of azure light shot out from between Qin Sang’s eyebrows, dazzlingly radiant.</p><p>The sword’s hum surpassed even thunder, and its overwhelming sword intent shot straight into the heavens!</p><p>The storm, which had not ceased for a moment since the tremors began, came to an abrupt halt, as if shamed and angered by being intimidated by a mere flying sword.</p><p>Fat Chicken, who had been idly guarding the secret realm’s exit, suddenly shuddered, its feathers standing on end. In that instant, it felt as though ten thousand sword energies were descending upon it. With a scream, it flapped its wings and fled in panic.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The spiritual sword retracted and extended freely, transforming into a swimming dragon. It circled briefly in the void before hovering in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>The Ebony Sword had become even more crystalline and pure, like a fragile piece of glass art. It was hard to imagine that this was a sword of slaughter, stained with countless traces of blood.</p><p>*Hum…*</p><p>The Ebony Sword trembled lightly.</p><p>A faint smile appeared on Qin Sang’s lips as he reached out to gently caress the sword’s body. His fingertips touched his lifebound spiritual sword, feeling the vast sword intent within.</p><p>Fat Chicken flapped over, knowing it had been a false alarm but still somewhat shaken. It complained, “Master, you scared me again!”</p><p>It looked curiously at the Ebony Sword. “Is this sword now a supreme-grade magical treasure? Congratulations, Master, on acquiring another treasure!”</p><p>A supreme-grade magical treasure was considered the pinnacle in the current era, and the aura the Ebony Sword had just displayed was clearly extraordinary.</p><p>“It is a supreme-grade magical treasure…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.</p><p>According to common sense, refining such a large piece of Soul-Nourishing Wood shouldn’t have resulted in just a supreme-grade magical treasure.</p><p>This confirmed the information Qin Sang had previously found: for a magical treasure to advance to a spiritual treasure, simply piling on materials wasn’t enough. Other opportunities were needed to nurture a trace of spirituality.</p><p>“This is fine. From now on, I’ll use the Ebony Sword to carry Senior Wandering Cloud’s true spirit. Crafting another supreme-grade magical treasure wouldn’t be easy, and its quality might not meet the requirements. If it affected the nurturing of the true spirit, it would be a great regret. The Ebony Sword is my lifebound spiritual sword, easier to control and more helpful during the nurturing process.”</p><p>With a thought, the Ebony Sword vanished into Qin Sang’s brow.</p><p>As a lifebound treasure, Qin Sang didn’t need to spend time refining it further.</p><p>He stood up, thinking, “It’s time to explore. The tremors might last for who knows how long, and I can’t wait indefinitely. Moreover, if I can truly enter the Abyssal Ruins from here, the chaos caused by the tremors would work to my advantage.”</p><p>Fat Chicken retreated into the Primordial Unity Ring.</p><p>Qin Sang first set up several more layers of restrictions at the secret realm’s exit. Then, with a flash, he dove into the water. He summoned the Ebony Sword again and, using the same method as before, opened the seal’s passage.</p><p>Under the influence of the storm, the seal’s power was chaotic, making it more difficult than last time. However, the Ebony Sword’s power far surpassed that of the Golden Sinking Sword, so Qin Sang actually found it easier.</p><p>In the water, the spiritual sword slashed through the air, leaving trails of sword energy. The storm on the water’s surface grew even more violent.</p><p>Before long, the vortex on the altar reappeared.</p><p>The tremors were now even clearer, coming from the other end. This indicated that the passage was bidirectional, so there was no need to worry about being unable to return. Qin Sang pointed lightly, and the Ebony Sword shot above the vortex, splitting into four sword lights that stabilized the vortex from all sides.</p><p>Once the passage was stable, Qin Sang recalled the Ebony Sword and summoned the Twelve Demon Banners, disappearing into them.</p><p>In an instant, everything went dark. Qin Sang knew he had been teleported elsewhere, but he found himself still submerged in water.</p>
