<h1>Chapter 1718: First Trial of the Sword Formation</h1><p>The armored man was none other than Zishen Dasheng.</p><p>The situation was irreversible, and these Great Sages and Demon Kings were fleeing faster than the next.</p><p>Zishen Dasheng's clansmen were not present, making his escape even easier.</p><p>With their high cultivation levels, they weren't worried about their own safety. Even if the Holy King's Palace suffered a crushing defeat, the great clans wouldn't drive them to their deaths.</p><p>Unless they could ensure a foolproof assassination, no great clan would want to bear the wrathful vengeance of a Demonic Great Sage.</p><p>After this battle, the change of ownership in the Holy King's Palace was a foregone conclusion.</p><p>Zishen Dasheng felt regret.</p><p>Their greatest loss was the qualification to share the Sacred Land.</p><p>However, over the years, the Holy King's Palace had reigned supreme over the various clans of the East Sea. They had followed the Azure Fox Holy King and reaped bountiful rewards. It was time to return to their cave dwellings for secluded cultivation.</p><p>If necessary, they could emerge once more and be treated as honored guests by another great clan.</p><p>The East Sea had always been like this, with one actor leaving the stage as another stepped into the spotlight. After a period of dormancy, a new world would unfold.</p><p>As a defeated general, Zishen Dasheng remained composed, without a trace of anger.</p><p>He was lost in his thoughts when a voice suddenly exposed his whereabouts.</p><p>The voice came from behind him. Before the uninvited guest spoke, he hadn't noticed anything at all, something even Longjing Dasheng couldn't achieve!</p><p>"Who!"</p><p>Zishen Dasheng's shock was profound.</p><p>Battle-hardened, he didn't turn his head, instead lunging forward as the armor on his body bloomed with dazzling azure light.</p><p>This armor was similar in style to the one he wore when infiltrating the land, but it was worlds apart. That armor served to conceal his aura, while this one was the treasured armor that Zishen Dasheng was famous for.</p><p>The azure light detached from his body, transforming into a sharp claw, as sharp as a three-foot-long azure blade, exceptionally keen.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The claw struck unexpectedly, piercing the air like lightning, and the void emitted a sharp, piercing shriek.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the strike hit empty space. Zishen Dasheng didn't feel any resistance, even though there was clearly no one behind him.</p><p>Zishen Dasheng's heart sank as he heard the voice again.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you are now a stray dog. Why not seek help from the Holy King?"</p><p>Despite addressing him directly, the other party's tone was strangely calm.</p><p>Even more terrifying, the voice seemed to come from all directions, as if the speaker was omnipresent and elusive.</p><p>At this moment, Zishen Dasheng suddenly noticed that the surrounding space had become dim at some point.  The sky seemed to be veiled, and upon closer inspection, he saw that the surrounding air was filled with silk-like sword energy, brimming with sword intent.</p><p>"This sword intent..."</p><p>Zishen Dasheng felt a strange familiarity with this sword intent.</p><p>The demon race excelled in cultivating their physical bodies and bloodlines. Many used swords, but those who ignored the shortcuts and devoted themselves to the Way of the Sword were rare anomalies.</p><p>As this thought flashed through his mind, Zishen Dasheng saw a stream of light descend before him, flickering and transforming into an illusory figure. One hand was clasped behind its back, the other held a sword, pointed obliquely downwards, its aura ethereal and shifting.</p><p>The figure was blurry, but the outline of its facial features could be vaguely discerned. Its eyes were grayish-white, its expression indifferent.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Zishen Dasheng finally recognized his enemy and his face paled.</p><p>He had a deep impression of Qin Sang. In the battle after the Six Continents Hall auction, Qin Sang had forced him to flee in disgrace, and two of his longtime followers had perished at Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>Later, when news of the Formless Immortal Sect spread, Zishen Dasheng learned that the Holy King had also suffered a minor setback at the hands of this person, and he felt somewhat relieved.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this person dared to appear in the heartland of the demon race!</p><p>Moreover, this person's cultivation...</p><p>Zishen Dasheng discovered that there wasn't just one illusory figure.</p><p>There were a total of seven such avatar-like figures, completely surrounding him.</p><p>The figures appeared incredibly illusory, as if they would shatter with a touch. But as these figures merged, the sword formation's aura dramatically changed, giving Zishen Dasheng the illusion of facing seven peerless swordsmen simultaneously.</p><p>Outside the sword formation.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered in the air.</p><p>When the Holy King's Palace army began to rout, he guessed that the Great Sages and Demon Kings would scatter.  He had infiltrated ahead of time. With him and the Skyeye Butterfly, the enemy had nowhere to hide.  His first target was the Azure-Furred Rat Demon who had fled alone.</p><p>The seven illusory figures were formed by his seven Sword Souls.</p><p>After stabilizing his cultivation, Qin Sang condensed his Sword Souls according to the cultivation method. The newly condensed Sword Souls were illusory and ethereal, but even so, after merging into the sword formation, they brought about earth-shattering changes to the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation.</p><p>Unable to find opponents of the same level, he could only test his swords against a Demonic Great Sage!</p><p>Qin Sang set up the sword formation in advance, and Zishen Dasheng, completely unaware, stumbled into it.</p><p>Inside the sword formation.</p><p>A rich azure light erupted from Zishen Dasheng's body. Within the azure light, the shadow of the Azure-Furred Rat Demon appeared, directly manifesting his demonic form.</p><p>The demonic form wore the treasured armor, a perfect fit.</p><p>This treasured armor could change according to his will.</p><p>The Azure-Furred Rat Demon looked up and howled at the sky. The treasured armor radiated brilliance, and his bones cracked as his body swelled along with the armor, instantly reaching several zhang in height.</p><p>His physical body grew wildly, seemingly without limit.</p><p>Towering over the world, the Azure-Furred Rat Demon shook his massive body, his eyes filled with ferocity. He lunged forward, slashing his giant claws. The sharp tips ripped through the void, emitting piercing shrieks, as if tearing through the sword threads and space itself.</p><p>A single claw strike could shatter mountains and rivers!</p><p>Qin Sang, already aware of the situation within the formation, remained impassive, seemingly casually forming a sword seal.</p><p>The Sword Souls' arms trembled slightly, their swords raised, their tips all pointing towards the Azure-Furred Rat Demon.</p><p>Suddenly, an unparalleled sword intent erupted. The sword threads drifting within the formation were drawn in, converging madly towards the swords in the Sword Souls' hands. The dazzling sword light stung the Azure-Furred Rat Demon's eyes.</p><p>The sword formation and the Sword Souls seemed to disappear, leaving only seven beams of sword light in the world.</p><p>Boundless killing intent and sword intent surged like a landslide and tsunami, assaulting the Azure-Furred Rat Demon's mind, overwhelming and unstoppable. The Azure-Furred Rat Demon's heart skipped a beat, his eyes filled with fear, his massive body trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>No one could imagine what he was experiencing.</p><p>He had never encountered such terrifying killing intent.  The Sword Souls moved as if appearing out of thin air, instantly reaching their peak power. Anyone with a slightly weaker will would have their defenses shattered on the spot.</p><p>In addition, there was a kind of pressure that he had only felt from the Azure Fox Holy King, as if he were facing not just this opponent, but also the rejection of heaven and earth, utterly alone and helpless.</p><p>Nascent Soul!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The sword light pierced the air.</p><p>It could no longer be considered mere sword light.  They were seven true swords of slaughter. Sword trails crisscrossed in the void, finally converging above the Azure-Furred Rat Demon's head, and slashing down!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The swords fell!</p><p>The Azure-Furred Rat Demon's towering body abruptly shrank, his cries a mix of pain and rage.</p><p>He tried to escape, but there was nowhere to go.</p><p>A series of explosions echoed.</p><p>Only a ball of sword light remained in the void, obscuring the rat demon.  The sword light was heavy as a thousand jun, crashing down towards the sea like a meteor.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>A deep crater was carved into the sea surface.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared above the cresting waves. A beam of sword light shot upwards, returning to his sleeve.</p><p>Looking down, the Azure-Furred Rat Demon had reverted to his original size, curled up and shivering.  Not only was his divine ability broken by a single sword strike, but his treasured armor also lost its luster, covered in visible cracks. Blood seeped continuously from the fissures.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The armor shattered in several places, fragments swept away by the waves.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>During his cultivation, Qin Sang had a premonition that after integrating the Sword Souls, the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation would undergo earth-shattering changes. The Nascent Soul stage was also a moment of enlightenment for the creator of the cultivation method.</p><p>Today's trial had truly lived up to his expectations. Not only did he defeat the Azure-Furred Rat Demon, but he also destroyed his treasured armor. If Qin Sang hadn't held back at the last moment, intending to capture him alive, the outcome would have been even more devastating.</p><p>It was important to note that this was with the newly condensed Sword Souls, without using his life-bound spiritual sword.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how powerful the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation would become in the future when wielded with the Cloud Wanderer Sword!</p><p>Of course, the sword Qin Sang was currently using wasn't ordinary either.</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, the sword light returned to his palm, revealing a rather elegant, slender sword.</p><p>This wasn't the Golden Sink Sword, but a sword obtained from Su Zinan's belongings, called the Gray Warbler Sword.</p><p>This wasn't Su Zinan's original possession either.</p><p>During the battle at Emperor Bestowal Mountain, four swords had flown out from the belongings of the female Sword Pavilion cultivator.</p><p>The Jade Sword was destroyed, the Golden Sword recorded the inheritance of the Golden Phase lineage's sword formation, and there were two other long swords. One was suspected to be the female cultivator's personal sword, lost in the chaos, while the other long sword was obtained by Su Zinan – the Gray Warbler Sword.</p><p>This sword was actually a pseudo-spiritual treasure!</p><p>Because it wasn't the female cultivator's life-bound spiritual sword, its rank hadn't fallen, but after years without being nurtured, it was still far from developing a spirit.</p><p>Refining a pseudo-spiritual treasure wasn't as troublesome as refining a true spiritual treasure. Qin Sang always kept it with him and had long mastered it.  Despite being a woman's sword, he didn't mind.</p><p>Having obtained this sword, Qin Sang didn't need to bother refining the Golden Sink Sword.</p><p>The *Sacrificial Essence Technique* couldn't be used on the Gray Warbler Sword.  Qin Sang remembered that a secret technique for refining ordinary pseudo-spiritual treasures had appeared at the Six Continents Hall auction and had been acquired by the Grand Elder of the瓊影門 .</p><p>He could visit them when he had the opportunity.</p><p>Refining both the Cloud Wanderer Sword and the Gray Warbler Sword alone would likely strain Qin Sang's energy, and he would inevitably prioritize the Cloud Wanderer Sword, using the Gray Warbler Sword as a temporary measure. However, it wouldn't hurt for him to learn that secret technique, as it would also benefit his path of artifact refinement.</p><p>A pseudo-spiritual treasure coupled with the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, and an ambush at that – no wonder Zishen Dasheng wasn't a match for a single strike.</p><p>Just then, streaks of violet light suddenly rose from the sea.  Zishen Dasheng wasn't dead, finally finding a chance to breathe, seemingly having activated some sort of extraordinary treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, his sword momentum rising again.</p><p>...</p><p>"Brother Hei, Bai Ming Mountain is not far ahead."</p><p>Four figures flew across the sea. One of them, dressed in white, pointed forward and spoke to the black-bearded, sturdy man beside him.</p><p>Several protrusions rose from the sea level. From afar, a few large islands could be seen, but they were desolate, covered in yellow grass, and seemed devoid of spiritual energy.</p><p>The speaker was Bai Xiao Dasheng.</p><p>The person he was talking to was another Great Sage under the Azure Fox Holy King. His true form was a black lion, and his title was simple and crude: Black Lion Dasheng.</p><p>After speaking, Bai Xiao Dasheng waved his hand remotely, dispelling the illusion there.  The scene instantly transformed.</p><p>The islands were, in fact, a single giant island.  There was only one mountain range on the island, winding like a dragon, majestic and imbued with spiritual grace, a truly rare and blessed land.</p><p>Black Lion Dasheng surveyed Bai Ming Mountain, his voice deep and resonant, "We have served the Holy King together for many years, but this is the first time you've invited me to your abode."</p><p>Bai Xiao Dasheng laughed heartily, "In the past, Brother Hei held a prominent position in the Holy King's Palace. How could you have looked upon this humble place? If I had extended an invitation then, wouldn't I have been asking for humiliation? Rest assured, Brother Hei, from now on, we shall be co-rulers of this mountain. Your cave dwelling will be no less magnificent than mine..."</p><p>Zishen Dasheng still had his clan, but Black Lion Dasheng, like the Azure Fox Holy King, came from the land and was completely alone.  Bai Xiao Dasheng deliberately sought to win over this demon, strengthening Bai Ming Mountain's forces for the future.</p><p>Black Lion Dasheng chuckled and said no more.</p><p>The other two were Demon Kings under Bai Xiao Dasheng, and other Demon Kings were leading their troops behind them. When the situation turned unfavorable, Bai Xiao Dasheng immediately took his trusted followers and left.</p><p>The demons flew towards Bai Ming Mountain and soon reached the shore.</p><p>A thin mist drifted over Bai Ming Mountain. Bai Xiao Dasheng had specifically built a mountain gate and training grounds to train his demon soldiers, all now concealed by a grand formation.</p><p>The demons landed in front of the mountain gate.  Before they could open the demon formation, Bai Xiao Dasheng, who was chatting and laughing with Black Lion Dasheng, suddenly twitched his nose, his brow furrowing.  "There's the scent of blood!"</p><p>The mist parted, revealing the mountain gate.</p><p>The demons' faces changed drastically!</p><p>In front of the mountain gate, blood flowed like a river, and two corpses lay sprawled on the ground.</p><p>A Bone Bird and a Demon Fish.</p><p>Judging by the qi and blood emanating from the demon corpses, they must have been Nascent Soul Demon Kings in life!</p><p>"Ming Gu!"</p><p>A Demon King exclaimed upon seeing the Bone Bird.</p><p>These two demons were Bai Xiao Dasheng's trusted subordinates, tasked with guarding Bai Ming Mountain. They had died inexplicably at their own doorstep.</p><p>A sense of foreboding arose in the hearts of several Demon Kings.</p><p>Just then, a Daoist priest emerged from behind the mountain gate. He smiled and nodded at them, then looked at Bai Xiao Dasheng.  "You've come too late.  This poor Daoist has been waiting for you for a long time."</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Bai Xiao Dasheng, who could never forget Qin Sang, paled.</p><p>Immediately afterward, all four Demon Kings' expressions turned blank.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't concealed his cultivation.</p><p>The person they had once hunted was now a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the two corpses beneath him.</p><p>It was quite a coincidence.</p><p>He had arrived at Bai Ming Mountain in advance, intending to intercept Bai Xiao Dasheng in front of the mountain.  The mountain was sealed by a grand formation, and even with his divine abilities, it would be difficult to infiltrate without being detected.</p><p>If the people inside activated the full power of the guardian formation, breaking it would require considerable effort and would alert the enemy.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he encountered these two demons while they were wandering outside.  Recognizing them as old enemies, he killed them without hesitation, then seized Bai Xiao Dasheng's cave dwelling and waited here.</p><p>He only targeted Demon Kings and wasn't interested in the lesser demons.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A black demonic wind arose out of nowhere. Black Lion Dasheng reacted swiftly, turning and fleeing.</p><p>Bai Xiao Dasheng wasn't slow either.  Not expecting any mercy from Qin Sang, and not daring to return home, he led his troops and escaped.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless, watching the four demons flee in panic. His eyes shone with a strange light, becoming deep and profound like the boundless starry sky, with thousands of stars reflected in them.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The sky and earth around Bai Ming Island darkened.</p><p>The four Demon Kings looked up in horror.</p><p>It was midday, but the sun had vanished without a trace, as if night had fallen.</p><p>Above, the stars shone brightly.</p><p>The starlight fell upon them, bringing a bone-chilling cold.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it became apparent that the starry sky was incomplete, lacking the full number of celestial stars. Only the White Tiger's seven constellations were present, but they were more than enough to trap them.</p><p>The four Demon Kings felt the void around them stretch infinitely, the sea beneath their feet disappearing as they were pulled into the depths of the starry sky, instantly surrounded by stars.</p><p>Qin Sang had changed his tactics once more. This formation was the Seven Constellations Domain Sword Formation!</p><p>Within each of the Seven Constellations' positions, a Sword Star was stationed, presided over by a Sword Soul.</p><p>Qin Sang soared into the sky, his robes fluttering as his true body entered the formation.</p><p>The river of stars flowed.</p><p></p>
