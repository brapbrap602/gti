<h1>Chapter 388: Condensing Yin and Refining Yang</h1><p>According to Qin Sang's knowledge, the first half of the *Scripture of the Celestial Corpse* allows for the creation of three types of Corpse Refinements.</p><p>Jiang Shi:  Created from ordinary corpses, the bodies of Qi Refining cultivators, or Foundation Establishment cultivators with damaged core centers. These are the weakest.</p><p>Sha Corpse: Requires the intact body of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  Their foundation is rebuilt using five elemental Yin objects, then imbued with Earthly Yin Qi. This is one of the biggest differences compared to other Corpse Refinement methods.</p><p>Living Corpse:  The requirements are complex.</p><p>First, the Celestial Corpse Talisman anchors the soul.</p><p>Multiple sets of five elemental Yin objects stabilize the Qi Sea. Earthly Yin Qi surges into the body.  Without damaging the core center and preserving the Living Corpse’s spiritual power, guiding the Earthly Yin Qi is extremely difficult, with a high chance of failure.</p><p>Qin Sang had just learned the secret method of refining a Flying Night Devil from Wu Shang's writings.</p><p>In essence:</p><p>It requires a Living Corpse refined from a Foundation Establishment cultivator at the peak of Fake Core Realm. Then, using a secret method and Earthly Yin Qi, a Golden Core or Demon Core is refined and integrated into the body, transforming into a Corpse Core.</p><p>As a disciple of the Celestial Corpse Sect, Wu Shang was very familiar with the *Scripture of the Celestial Corpse*. After making up his mind, he made thorough preparations, both mentally and physically.</p><p>Refining himself into a Living Corpse involved two changes:</p><p>First, the soul fuses with the Celestial Corpse Talisman, leading to unknown changes.</p><p>Second, the body undergoes corpse transformation, especially after being infused with Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>Having chosen this unorthodox path to immortality through Corpse Refinement, Wu Shang was ready to forsake his flesh. As long as his consciousness remained, even if his body became a corpse, it would be worth it!</p><p>The Celestial Corpse Talisman can transform others into Living Corpses. What if used on oneself?</p><p>Wu Shang gathered numerous spiritual pills, medicines, secret methods, and magical artifacts to fortify and protect his primordial spirit. He then spent his entire fortune to prepare everything needed for Corpse Refinement, including a Demon Core.</p><p>Refining a Living Corpse has no strict requirements for Golden Cores or Demon Cores, as long as they are intact.</p><p>No one knows if any Celestial Corpse Sect ancestor had ever been mad enough to use this on themselves since the Celestial Corpse Talisman technique was created.</p><p>There are no such records in the sect.</p><p>Wu Shang knew he was the first.</p><p>As the Celestial Corpse Talisman merged with his soul:</p><p>Wu Shang discovered it did indeed have an effect. But firstly, he had refined the talisman himself. Secondly, his modifications to the forbidden techniques worked.  As long as he didn’t actively erase his consciousness, he wouldn’t immediately lose it and become a mindless corpse.</p><p>He felt a slight drowsiness, indicating that the talisman was indeed affecting his primordial spirit.</p><p>Complete assimilation by the talisman was inevitable. However, this change was gradual, requiring time. The measures he had prepared bought him more time.</p><p>As for the final outcome, Wu Shang didn't know.</p><p>Perhaps, after transforming into a Flying Night Devil, with his increased power, he could find a solution.</p><p>The changes to his body went as expected. Before the Earthly Yin Qi entered, he could counteract the corpse transformation by consuming the essence blood of other Foundation Establishment cultivators. Once the Yin Qi entered, the corpse transformation would accelerate dramatically, unstoppable by any means.</p><p>After the Yin Qi entered, he quickly stopped resisting and became a true corpse.</p><p>Of course, Wu Shang didn't care.</p><p>Instead, he was thankful that his consciousness remained, giving him a sliver of hope.</p><p>Wu Shang immediately began the next stage of transformation.</p><p>Fusing the Demon Core, becoming a Flying Night Devil!</p><p>He succeeded, becoming a Golden Core level Corpse Refinement.</p><p>Looking within, his Corpse Core, stained black as ink by the Yin Qi, resided in his core center, ready to be commanded.</p><p>This was his 'Golden Core'!</p><p>This was the power of the Golden Core stage!</p><p>This power was intoxicating.</p><p>Just as Wu Shang was ecstatic, he was horrified to discover that the Corpse Core was continuously releasing Earthly Yin Qi, assaulting his primordial spirit!</p><p>In fact, this had begun when he incorporated the Yin Qi as a Living Corpse. However, the duration was short, and Wu Shang hadn't paid attention. He thought that after forming the Corpse Core and gaining Golden Core level power, he could suppress the Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Corpse Core not only failed to suppress it, but intensified it.</p><p>He hadn't lost his consciousness to the Celestial Corpse Talisman, but under the constant erosion of the Earthly Yin Qi, his mind began to be affected, gradually becoming deranged.</p><p>At this rate, he would soon lose his mind completely, becoming a mindless husk!</p><p>This sudden turn of events sobered Wu Shang.</p><p>With little time left, he tried everything to combat the Earthly Yin Qi. As a Flying Night Devil, his power had surged, granting him access to treasures previously beyond his reach.</p><p>He consumed various spiritual pills, tried countless righteous and demonic secret methods, practiced righteous Sun Cultivation techniques, refined Earthly Fire Essence into his body...</p><p>Wu Shang tried countless methods, but they were either ineffective against the Earthly Yin Qi or insufficiently powerful to withstand its onslaught.</p><p>Finally, Wu Shang suddenly recalled something, a supreme Yang marvel on par with Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>Heavenly Yang Qi!</p><p>Perhaps, incorporating Heavenly Yang Qi could neutralize the Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>Both Earthly Yin Qi and Heavenly Yang Qi are born from the spiritual essence of heaven and earth, supremely Yin and Yang, incredibly violent. Ordinary cultivators wouldn't dare approach them, let alone incorporate them, much less both.</p><p>One misstep could result in explosive death.</p><p>Wu Shang pondered deeply and gradually found a possible solution, one he believed held great promise.</p><p>However, by then, his mind was severely eroded, and time was running out. He couldn't search for Heavenly Yang Qi to test his theory; he had to find spiritual herbs to cleanse his primordial spirit first.</p><p>So, Wu Shang came here, searching for Nightfall Lilies.</p><p>Sadly, Wu Shang was already at his limit. His primordial spirit was almost completely consumed by the Earthly Yin Qi, and his fading consciousness could no longer hold on.</p><p>Within this ice cave, his mind succumbed, and he became a mindless Flying Night Devil.</p><p>In his final moments, Wu Shang was filled with regret, unwilling to let the results of his painstaking research vanish without a trace in this desolate ice cave.</p><p>In his last moments, he left his writings on the ice wall and carved his name!</p><p>It's no wonder the writing on the ice wall became increasingly erratic. At that time, Wu Shang was on the brink of madness, persevering until the very end with immense willpower.</p><p>In his writings, Wu Shang detailed the secret method he couldn't personally test, which he called—Condensing Yin and Refining Yang!</p><p>And with his final strength, he planted a sliver of obsession within the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>It was because of this obsession that the Flying Night Devil remained here, and upon sensing the Celestial Corpse Talisman's aura within a Living Corpse, it did not kill.</p><p>“May a descendant of the Celestial Corpse Sect find my writings and bring them forth.</p><p>“If you are ambitious, you may attempt my secret method and condense a Corpse Core.</p><p>“Whether you remain trapped at Foundation Establishment, growing old and dying,</p><p>“Or risk everything, striving against fate, devoting yourself to the path of the corpse to attain immortality and witness the wonders of the Golden Core,</p><p>“The choice is yours.”</p>
