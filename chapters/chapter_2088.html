<h1>Chapter 2079: The Golden Toad King</h1><p>“True Monarch, your discerning eye is truly remarkable.  The formation's foundation is yet to be established, yet you've already gleaned so much. This humble Daoist is deeply impressed.  I've held this aspiration since my breakthrough to Deity Transformation and, together with Junior Brother Shen, have devoted considerable effort to deducing this formation.  Whenever we encountered an impasse, we would shamelessly consult Fairy Liu Li. She even assisted us in deducing the most crucial aspects of the formation, providing invaluable aid for which we can offer no adequate recompense.”</p><p>Li Yufu bowed towards the north, his tone sincere.</p><p>True Monarch Hegao revealed a look of envy. “A glimpse of a leopard's spot reveals the whole beast.  Once this formation is complete, it will surely be the foremost protective formation in the Storm Realm! I hadn't expected Headmaster Li to possess such profound mastery in the Dao of Formations and Restrictions.”</p><p>Li Yufu humbly replied, “The True Monarch overpraises me. Limited by my narrow perspective, this formation actually has many imperfections. I've racked my brains, but in the end, I could only resort to some clumsy methods, patching and mending to barely maintain the formation's structure.  I plan to slowly improve it in the future. If your esteemed sect wishes to refine its protective formation, or if the Three Sects Alliance were to collaborate on a formation, the result would certainly surpass this one. Were this not my sect's protective formation, I would certainly visit your esteemed sect to seek your guidance.”</p><p>Since it was a sect's protective formation, it was natural to avoid the involvement of outsiders. This was only reasonable.</p><p>He sighed again, “The Azure Ram Sect's foundation is still shallow. Even knowing the immense difficulty, for the sake of providing a sanctuary for future disciples, we have no choice but to undertake this endeavor.”</p><p>True Monarch Hegao simply smiled. He didn't detect anything unusual, believing Li Yufu's words to be perfectly reasonable.</p><p>The Azure Ram Sect already possessed the aura of a major sect, with countless disciples. Deer Wilds had long become overcrowded, and the few branch sects couldn't accommodate many more. Moreover, with disciples scattered everywhere, their hearts wavering, it was detrimental to fostering unity.</p><p>Now, with the situation gradually improving, the Azure Ram Sect's choice to establish a new mountain gate at this time, although seemingly abrupt, was justifiable.</p><p>He had indeed been startled by the scale of the formation, not expecting such a grand undertaking from the Azure Ram Sect.  But on second thought, only a small portion of the formation's base had been laid.  Deducing its entirety from this limited view could lead to inaccuracies.</p><p>A formation's vast scale didn't necessarily equate to its ingenuity. It could simply be an attempt to maximize power by incorporating everything possible. Perhaps, as Li Yufu had said, once completed, it would merely be a bloated formation.</p><p>Of course, with Fairy Liu Li's involvement in the deduction, True Monarch Hegao didn't dare to jump to conclusions. He and Li Yufu flew slowly towards the temporary palace, their eyes constantly scanning the ground, attempting to discern any clues.</p><p>This was considered the preparatory stage, and the Azure Ram Sect still allowed outsiders like them entry.  After some time, this opportunity would be gone.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>True Monarch Hegao indeed noticed something.  “This structure… Headmaster Li, it seems you intend to divide the entire formation, separating it into numerous sub-formations, and ultimately merging them into one?”</p><p>“I cannot deceive the True Monarch’s discerning eye,” Li Yufu admitted admiringly. “That is precisely my intention. Does the True Monarch deem it feasible?”</p><p>True Monarch Hegao stroked his beard. “Any spiritual formation can be divided.  At its core, the process of setting up any spiritual formation is precisely this: divide first, then combine. However, Headmaster Li, you seem to have divided the formation excessively. So many sub-formations… hmm…”</p><p>True Monarch Hegao fell silent for a moment, making some calculations in his mind, then gently shook his head. “Doing so certainly simplifies the initial stages. However, when it comes to the merging step, the difficulty increases dramatically. Unless Fairy Liu Li personally intervenes, otherwise… I wonder what ingenious plan Headmaster Li has?”</p><p>Li Yufu replied frankly, “Fairy Liu Li is a pillar of this realm.  How could we dare disturb her seclusion with such a trivial matter? I have no ingenious plan. When the time comes, I will call upon the entire sect, with each disciple presiding over a sub-formation, allowing them to comprehend it in advance.  With united hearts, we will overcome this challenge!”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>True Monarch Hegao hesitated. Without understanding the complete picture of the formation, he couldn’t judge the feasibility of this approach. Since Li Yufu dared to do it, he must have some degree of certainty.</p><p>However…</p><p>True Monarch Hegao furrowed his brow. “If you do this, at that time, your esteemed sect will find it difficult to divert its attention to external matters, and I fear it won’t be accomplished in a short period.”</p><p>“Indeed,” Li Yufu nodded. “I had intended to visit your esteemed sect in a while to discuss a matter with the Three Sects Alliance.  Since we have this opportunity today, I'll inquire about the True Monarch's opinion first.”</p><p>They had just arrived near the temporary palace.</p><p>Li Yufu instructed his disciples to attend to the spirit cranes pulling the chariot and invited True Monarch Hegao into the hall. Once settled, he said, “Regarding the past few counteroffensives, does the True Monarch believe we’ve gained any substantial benefit?”</p><p>True Monarch Hegao pondered, “Aside from dampening the Longyou Clan’s arrogance, disrupting their deployments, and gaining temporary respite, there seem to be no real benefits. The territories we recapture are slowly taken back again.”</p><p>“Precisely!”</p><p>Li Yufu nodded. “Someone has been constantly advocating for counteroffensives, but this humble Daoist believes such actions are counterproductive. Fairy Liu Li is in seclusion and must not be disturbed.  The Longyou Clan army occupies the Western Wastelands, but they seem to be merely harassing, with no desire for a large-scale invasion. We should seize this opportunity to recuperate and accumulate strength, refraining from provoking the Longyou Clan for now.”</p><p>True Monarch Hegao fell into deep thought. He could discern Li Yufu's ulterior motive: only by avoiding a major war with the Longyou Clan could the Azure Ram Sect recall its disciples and have ample time to set up the protective formation.</p><p>He had anticipated this, but he also noticed another piece of information in Li Yufu's words.</p><p>After the last struggle for Azure Spirit Qi, Fairy Liu Li had been in seclusion ever since, without revealing the reason.</p><p>Judging by Li Yufu's tone, it seemed that even if a war broke out between the two clans, Fairy Liu Li wouldn't easily emerge from seclusion.</p><p>What matter could be so important?</p><p>There were rumors that Fairy Liu Li had been seriously injured while single-handedly intercepting the Longyou Clan Chief during the last war. However, at the war's conclusion, he hadn't detected anything amiss with Fairy Liu Li. Perhaps she had disguised herself too well.</p><p>“Rumor has it that Fairy Liu Li is attempting to break through to Void Refinement in this seclusion?” True Monarch Hegao asked directly.</p><p>“I don’t know where the rumor originated. Even Palace Master Tong is unaware of the extent of Fairy Liu Li’s cultivation.  The Void Refinement stage is certainly not easily attained.”</p><p>Li Yufu shook his head slightly. “I do hope the rumor is true.  In my opinion, unless the Longyou Clan invades our heartland, it's not worth our concern.  Only Azure Spirit Qi is fundamental. Our best course of action is to conserve our strength and focus on seizing as much Azure Spirit Qi as possible! As long as someone can break through to Void Refinement, we can completely resolve the external threat!”</p><p>Seeing True Monarch Hegao's silence, Li Yufu added softly, “Has the True Monarch noticed that the Longyou Clan Chief has also been unheard of since the last war?”</p><p>True Monarch Hegao's expression changed slightly, but he quickly regained his composure.</p><p>It was normal for the Longyou Clan Chief to enter seclusion to refine Azure Spirit Qi after a major war.  One couldn't simply conclude that he was about to break through.</p><p>The Deity Transformation stage was already so arduous; without Azure Spirit Qi, countless fellow Daoists would have returned to dust, let alone Void Refinement?</p><p>The Longyou Clan had never been a particularly prosperous clan, residing in a remote corner with limited resources.  They likely had difficulty obtaining any divine medicines.</p><p>Being trapped by a bottleneck for several centuries was perfectly normal.</p><p>Just as these thoughts crossed his mind, True Monarch Hegao and Li Yufu simultaneously looked towards the hall's entrance, sensing a powerful aura approaching.</p><p>“Another esteemed guest arrives. Please wait a moment, True Monarch,” Li Yufu bowed and went out to greet the newcomer.</p><p>The esteemed guest came from the west, and the clouds on the horizon shimmered with golden light, as if the heavens themselves were gilded.</p><p>A man in golden robes broke through the air.</p><p>He had round eyes and a wide mouth, his figure slightly stout, yet he possessed a dignified bearing and regal aura. His golden robes were covered in swirling, pockmarked patterns forming bizarre designs, but these did not detract from his presence.</p><p>Seeing this person, Li Yufu's pupils constricted slightly. He bowed from afar. “I was unaware of the Golden Toad King's arrival. This humble Daoist apologizes for not welcoming you sooner.”</p><p>The newcomer was indeed the king of the Golden Toad Clan from the Demonic Sea.</p><p>The Demonic Sea demon clans had different customs from the Eastern Sea demon clans.  Their clan kings were all titled "King," and they disliked being addressed as "Great Sage" or "Sage King."</p><p>In their view, the title of "King" signified nobility.</p><p>Even when facing the kings of smaller clans, the larger clans would accord them the courtesy due a king.</p><p>Among the Demonic Sea demon clans, the Dragon, Phoenix, and Golden Toad Clans were once the most powerful. The Phoenix King had perished during her Deity Transformation tribulation, succumbing to her heart demons, leading to the gradual decline of the Phoenix Clan. They were still a powerful clan, but compared to the burgeoning Flood Dragon and Golden Toad Clans, they had fallen behind.</p><p>The Golden Toad King's strength was slightly inferior to the Flood Dragon King, but he was still not to be underestimated.</p><p>“Haha, this King has come uninvited. Headmaster Li, please don't consider me an intrusion.”</p><p>The Golden Toad King laughed, his voice booming like thunder.</p><p>The laughter caused the Azure Ram Sect disciples below to feel their blood churn. They looked up, but could only see the golden radiance filling the sky.</p><p>Fortunately, the laughter quickly subsided. The Golden Toad King landed before Li Yufu, returning the bow, then let out a soft exclamation as he saw True Monarch Hegao emerge from the temporary palace.</p><p>His eyes flickered, and he bowed again. “Unexpectedly, Headmaster Hegao is also present.”</p><p>“I’ve only just arrived. The spiritual tea is still warm.  What brings the Golden Toad King out on this excursion?”  True Monarch Hegao inquired curiously.</p><p>The Golden Toad King didn't conceal his purpose, replying casually, "This King has been cultivating recently and has luckily gained some enlightenment.  I have a faint feeling that I'm about to break through a certain barrier, but I lack a specific external ingredient. I recall Sage King Dragon Whale possessing this ingredient, so I came to visit him to request it. Hearing that the Azure Ram Sect is re-establishing its mountain gate, I decided to come offer my congratulations."</p><p>Hearing this, Li Yufu and True Monarch Hegao were both startled.</p><p>Carefully observing the Golden Toad King, the two exchanged a discreet glance and felt reassured.  The Golden Toad King should still be some distance away from breaking through to late Deity Transformation.</p><p>The emergence of a late Deity Transformation expert among the demon clans would be beneficial for the entire Storm Realm, but not necessarily for the human race.</p><p>Humans lacked Dao techniques, while the demon clans could continue to refine their cultivation, their power steadily growing.  However, due to the unresolved external threat, humans couldn't restrict the demon clans, and could only watch as their power increased.</p><p>Sage King Dragon Whale and the Flood Dragon King possessed even greater cultivation than the Golden Toad King. If even the Golden Toad King could break through, it was likely that three late Deity Transformation demon experts would appear in quick succession.</p><p>Currently, the human race only had Fairy Liu Li.  Facing three such opponents, the balance of power between the human and demon races would be completely overturned!</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, why don't we continue our conversation inside the palace,” Li Yufu invited.</p><p>“No rush!”</p><p>The Golden Toad King waved his hand, gazing downwards, his eyes sweeping across the land. A moment later, a glint flashed in his eyes. “What a magnificent formation!”</p><p>True Monarch Hegao smiled faintly.  “I previously stated that once this formation is complete, it will be the foremost protective formation in the world.  Does the Golden Toad King agree?”</p><p>The Golden Toad King replied, "Our demon clans' understanding of the Dao of Formations and Restrictions is far inferior to that of the human race. The True Monarch’s discerning eye is undoubtedly accurate.”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist is too modest,” True Monarch Hegao shook his head, looking at Li Yufu. “Since we've met by chance today, why not ask for the Golden Toad King's opinion?”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The Golden Toad King glanced at both of them. “What were the two of you discussing earlier?”</p><p>The three returned to the temporary palace, and Li Yufu instructed someone to serve fresh spiritual tea, then recounted their previous conversation.</p><p>The Golden Toad King didn't immediately express his stance. “Recuperation and reducing casualties among our ranks is certainly a good thing. However, this King cannot make the decision alone.  I must consult with Fellow Daoists Flood Dragon King and Sage King Dragon Whale.”</p><p>True Monarch Hegao took a sip of spiritual tea, concealing the glint that flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Among the most renowned demon kings in the Storm Realm, there was also the Feathered King of the Northern Sea. His cultivation was inferior to these three, but he was still the king of a region’s demon clans, commanding a multitude of experts and wielding considerable power.</p><p>The Golden Toad King didn't mention the Feathered King, but specifically singled out Sage King Dragon Whale. Was this a deliberate attempt to display his closeness to Sage King Dragon Whale in his presence?</p><p>In fact, Sage King Dragon Whale wasn't particularly close to the Demonic Sea demon clans, instead maintaining closer ties with the human race of the Central Continent. After all, they had long been neighbors, familiar with each other's backgrounds.</p><p>But appearances could be deceiving.  With those not of their kind, who knew what Sage King Dragon Whale might be secretly planning?</p><p>True Monarch Hegao sighed inwardly at the complexity of the situation, finding it increasingly troublesome.</p><p>Previously, facing a common enemy, they had been grasshoppers tied to the same rope, compelled to cooperate in the face of life and death, and other conflicts were overshadowed. Now, with the situation slightly improved, various underlying tensions were beginning to surface.</p><p>Just the three of them couldn’t reach any concrete conclusions.  Li Yufu's aim was to spread the word through them.</p><p>True Monarch Hegao finished his tea and rose to take his leave.  “Headmaster Li, if you lack any resources, simply send a letter, and I will instruct someone to assist in procuring them.”</p><p>The Golden Toad King also generously offered, “This King also has some modest reserves. Headmaster Li, please don't hesitate to ask!”</p><p>“I thank both Fellow Daoists in advance,” Li Yufu replied. Naturally, he wouldn’t take these words at face value.  Their resources weren’t so easily obtained.</p><p>True Monarch Hegao glanced at the Golden Toad King.  “Will the Golden Toad King not accompany me?”</p><p>The Golden Toad King chuckled. "This King is curious about the Azure Ram Sect's grand formation and intends to observe it for a few more days, as long as Headmaster Li doesn’t object.”</p><p>Li Yufu was inwardly surprised, but his expression remained unchanged. “How could I object!  I would be delighted.  I was just about to ask the Golden Toad King for his insights, to see if there are any flaws or omissions in this formation.”</p><p>“Haha, then this King will make myself at home…”</p><p>The Golden Toad King was true to his word.  After seeing off True Monarch Hegao, he informed Li Yufu and flew to the ground, unreservedly examining the formation, even observing the Azure Ram Sect disciples at work.</p><p>However, the actual formation setup hadn’t begun yet, so there was no risk of him discovering anything substantial.</p><p>Li Yufu stood before the temporary palace with his hands clasped behind his back, watching the Golden Toad King appear here and there, pondering inwardly, "This fellow is remarkably attentive…"</p><p>The Golden Toad King acted openly, seemingly driven by pure curiosity, with no apparent ulterior motives.</p><p>Remembering that his martial uncle was in the back mountain, Li Yufu remained calm, quietly watching the Golden Toad King's performance.</p>
