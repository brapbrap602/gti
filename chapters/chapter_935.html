<h1>Chapter 927: Return to the Seven Kills Hall</h1><p>Chapter 927: Return to the Seven Kills Hall</p><p>After discussing with Elder Zou and Qin Sang, Elder Zou invited Qin Sang to go with him, but Qin Sang declined.</p><p>“I am accustomed to traveling alone, and before going to the Seven Kills Hall, I have some personal matters to attend to. I won’t trouble Elder Zou and the other fellow cultivators,” Qin Sang said with a smile.</p><p>The East Pole Alliance and the West Nether Alliance definitely have something to do with the Seven Kills Hall, and Qin Sang has been deliberately avoiding contact with them.</p><p>Elder Zou sighed, his tone somewhat ambiguous, “Since Daoist Qin has no intention to join us, I won't force you.  This may be our last meeting.  Take care, Daoist Qin.”</p><p>“Take care, Elder Zou!”</p><p>Qin Sang responded solemnly, bowing in farewell.</p><p>After parting ways with Elder Zou, Qin Sang frequently visited shops and auction houses, spending a large sum of spirit stones to purchase various treasures. Three days later, he left Heavenly Blessing Island alone and flew towards East Gate Island.</p><p>Returning to East Gate Island stirred memories of his first entry into the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>The Seven Kills Hall is unpredictable. A safe place one time might be occupied by a pack of ferocious beasts the next, or a dangerous ancient prohibition might be triggered for some reason.</p><p>However, his current strength far surpasses that of his past. As long as he is cautious enough, the outcome should not be worse than last time.</p><p>Inside the temporary cave dwelling he rented…</p><p>Qin Sang took out fifteen banner poles, slowly caressing them.</p><p>In Qin Sang's heart, the most important task in this trip to the Seven Kills Hall was not to find the ancient teleportation array, but to subdue the Nine Nether Demon Fire and refine the eighteen demon banners.</p><p>As a refiner, he was well aware of the value of top-grade magical artifacts. If he missed this opportunity, he might not have another chance to obtain a top-grade magical artifact even after reaching the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>With the eighteen demon banners in hand, even if he couldn't find a way back, he would at least have sufficient strength to seek more opportunities.</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and a thoughtful expression appeared on his face.</p><p>He remembered the Flying Night Rakshasa still in the Ghost Land, wondering how it was doing.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected to have his strongest corpse puppet seized by the wandering spirits in the Ghost Land. Every time he recalled it, he felt a bit annoyed.</p><p>That ghost's strength shouldn't be too strong, otherwise, it wouldn't have acted so stealthily; it could have directly attacked his physical body. However, it seemed to be intelligent, knowing how to conceal the soul mark he left in the corpse puppet.  He couldn’t be careless.</p><p>The Ghost Land, sealed by the Nine Nether Demon Fire for countless years, having such a ghost was intriguing; some kind of mutation must have occurred.  The lifespan of ghost cultivators is indeed longer than that of normal cultivators, but it shouldn't be this extraordinary.</p><p>It seemed that the Ghost Land still hid secrets he hadn't discovered.</p><p>Back then, his Sky-Eyed Butterfly hadn't broken through to its third transformation, and its Heavenly Eye wasn't open, otherwise, he wouldn't have been tricked so easily.</p><p>Now, his Sky-Eyed Butterfly had advanced to the mid-stage of its third transformation, its innate ability even more refined. This was the time for revenge.  As long as that ghost dared to show itself, it would be exposed under the Heavenly Eye.</p><p>Retrieving the corpse puppet was secondary; a corpse puppet comparable to a Foundation Establishment cultivator was no longer of much use to him.</p><p>When refining the banners and collecting the Nine Nether Demon Fire, he absolutely couldn't be disturbed.</p><p>He needed to slowly extract the power of the Nine Nether Demon Fire and seal it within the banners. A small accident could cause the demon fire to erupt and backfire on him.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang put away the banner poles, calmed his mind, and waited for the final moment.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang stayed on East Gate Island for a month.</p><p>During this time, more and more cultivators gathered here, but the lack of news about the opening of the Seven Kills Hall made everyone anxious.</p><p>Another half-month passed, and Qin Sang, who was meditating in his cave, was awakened by a powerful aura.</p><p>Knowing that the time had come, he stopped his cultivation, quickly packed up his belongings, and put the stone coffin containing his external avatar on his back.</p><p>As soon as he flew out of the cave, he heard a voice from above, “The Seven Kills Hall will open tonight at midnight. Fellow cultivators, be prepared.”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and he turned into a stream of light, flying out of East Gate Island. He took a detour and flew towards the storm on his own.  He kept his light low-key, as it was still early until midnight, giving him plenty of time.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang touched the storm barrier again.</p><p>The sight of the storm within was still shocking.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how the cultivation world had become like this, or what methods those powerful beings had used to leave this barrier, isolating the storm and protecting their descendants for so long.</p><p>After looking around, Qin Sang's brow flashed, and he summoned his ebony sword.</p><p>With the sword light covering his body, he hesitated not at all before passing through the barrier.</p><p>Entering the storm, Qin Sang immediately encountered a grey whirlwind rushing towards him. His expression changed slightly, and with a flash of his sword, he swiftly moved over a dozen meters.</p><p>The whirlwind passed him, but the ensuing waves were immense, impossible to avoid.  Qin Sang, acting swiftly, intensified his sword light, piercing through the monstrous waves despite the terrifying impact.</p><p>His strength had grown considerably. He dared to traverse the storm's outer edge alone. Yet, even facing the whirlwind's fringes, he felt a surge of fear.  He had no doubt of its power; if caught, even escape wouldn't guarantee safety, or knowing where he'd end up.</p><p>Lost in the storm's depths, finding his way back would be nearly impossible—the outcome predictable.</p><p>With caution, Qin Sang slowed down, flying on his sword. He skillfully navigated the gaps in the whirlwind, following the jade talisman's guidance toward the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>The journey was mostly smooth.  Nearing the halfway point, Qin Sang suddenly frowned, halting his flight.</p><p>“Rumbling…”</p><p>The furious wind and waves drowned out all other sounds.</p><p>Suspended in mid-air, Qin Sang used his protective sword energy to withstand the onslaught, turning towards his left.  At the edge of his vision, two figures also stood still, somewhat obscured and indistinct due to the storm.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang sensed their gaze—clearly hostile.</p><p>"Xiang Yi said some villains would hide in the storm, taking advantage of the chaos.  Have I really run into them?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly; a cold smile played on his masked face.</p><p>They faced each other for a moment. Seeing no immediate action from them, Qin Sang drew his ebony sword and attacked, disappearing into the distance.</p><p>Only after Qin Sang's departure did the two figures move.</p><p>"He's gotten away!"</p><p>One of them scanned the area, unable to locate Qin Sang. He lamented, beating his chest, "Big Brother, we finally found a lone traveler, why didn't you let me attack?"</p><p>The other, wearing a ghost mask, stared at the direction Qin Sang vanished, saying gravely,  "Anyone who dares travel alone through the storm is not to be trifled with. His flight was steady and unwavering; he's no ordinary person. I sensed a dangerous aura from him. I suspect if we attacked, we'd deeply regret it."</p><p>"Really that strong?"</p><p>The other was startled. "Forget it!  Let's listen to Big Brother. Let him be! This place has bad vibes. Let's move somewhere else. We have to complete our business today."</p>
