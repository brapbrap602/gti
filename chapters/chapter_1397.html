<h1></h1><p>Qin Sang stood in mid-air, surrounded by Demonic Flames. His gaze swept indifferently over Bifang, the Wind Master, and the White-Clothed Man.</p><p>Bifang was hindered. The Wind Master and Frog-Fish fought to be first.</p><p>This situation was deliberately created by him, solely to delay time, to pit these people against each other, focusing their energy here.</p><p>The Wind Master rapidly approached the White-Clothed Man, eager to strike.</p><p>The silk threads on his left arm reappeared.</p><p>However, this time it wasn't a single thread. A mass of threads transformed on their own into a square painting.</p><p>Within the painting was only the image of a tornado, empty otherwise. The background was a faint blue, uncertain if it was the sky or the sea.</p><p>The painting seemed ethereal.</p><p>The tornado was actually rotating within the painting, its speed increasing, until only a blurred pillar of wind could be seen.</p><p>The void around the painting began to distort, seemingly affected by the image within.</p><p>However, no other abnormalities appeared elsewhere.</p><p>Seeing this, Frog-Fish's expression changed drastically, silently lamenting.</p><p>"Break!"</p><p>Just as Frog-Fish was extremely anxious, the Wind Master stared at the back of the White-Clothed Man and coldly spat out a word!</p><p>The tornado abruptly burst out of the painting.</p><p>The seemingly small pillar of wind possessed deafening howls, shaking the heavens and the earth.</p><p>In an instant, the tornado swelled to dozens of *zhang*, flying over a stone mountain and directly obliterating its summit, leaving behind a bare platform.</p><p>A ray of azure light detached from the tornado and shot out, leaving behind trails of azure shadows in the void.</p><p>Only when it approached the White-Clothed Man could it be seen that it was a Wind Cone.</p><p>A seemingly simple attack.</p><p>The White-Clothed Man couldn't evade it!</p><p>In this critical moment, he had no choice but to repeat his previous trick. An Ice Shield emerged behind him, but this time it was different. It seemed to be the main body of a magical treasure, forming a pale blue light curtain.</p><p>As soon as the Ice Shield materialized, the Wind Cone pierced through the air.</p><p>After a burst of ear-piercing friction, the light curtain surrounding the Ice Shield was easily pierced by the Wind Cone.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Ice Shield was struck by the main body of the Wind Cone, shaking wildly.</p><p>The two forces refused to yield to each other, transmitting 'crack' sounds, and two shocking cracks exploded from where the tip of the Wind Cone struck. A large chunk of the Ice Shield magical treasure actually shattered!</p><p>'Puh!'</p><p>The White-Clothed Man's chest was pierced by the remaining power of the Wind Cone, revealing a bloody hole. He spat out blood on the spot and fell headlong towards the ground.</p><p>However, his will to survive was incredibly strong. His tattered body wobbled and flew up, summoning the remaining power to continue escaping.</p><p>The Wind Master seemed to sense something and frowned slightly. But before he could think about it carefully, Frog-Fish couldn't hold back anymore and attacked him.</p><p>The White-Clothed Man was severely injured, already at the end of his rope, unable to stir up any waves. What Frog-Fish needed to do was prevent the White-Clothed Man from falling into the Wind Master's hands.</p><p>Emerald green light obscured the Wind Master's vision, and this space was frozen.</p><p>The Wind Master coldly snorted and tapped the painting.</p><p>A new tornado appeared in the painting.</p><p>However, this time it didn't manifest a Wind Cone, but like wind sweeping away clouds, blew the green light into scattered pieces. His figure merged into the pillar of wind, rapidly advancing.</p><p>Frog-Fish knew that the Wind Master was difficult to deal with. Seeing this, he bit his fangs and a strange 'glug' sound emanated from his throat. He spat out a green pellet.</p><p>It looked like a Demon Core, or perhaps some kind of treasure.</p><p>As soon as the pellet appeared, the green light finally managed to stabilize and became increasingly dense.</p><p>The man and demon each displayed their supernatural powers, entangled with each other, but still rapidly approaching the White-Clothed Man.</p><p>Turning to Qin Sang himself.</p><p>Seemingly, he was using all his strength to drive the Demonic Flames to deal with Bifang, but in reality, most of it was a bluff. Most of his energy was used to sense the distant Nascent Soul Puppet and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>Outside the desolate island.</p><p>While the powerful experts were chasing the White-Clothed Man.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat was struggling to flee, finally seeing the Storm Belt resembling a curtain of sky, and plunged into it.</p><p>'Hu!'</p><p>The Rainbow Rat let out a long sigh of relief, its eyes rolling around rapidly.</p><p>Entering the chaotic Storm Belt would completely erase its tracks. Even if those people chased after it, they would never be able to find it.</p><p>Just at that moment, a look of struggle appeared in the Rainbow Rat's eyes, the intensity fiercer than before.</p><p>"Don't worry! In a moment, I will treat you well and repay you for your gratitude in being chased for ten thousand miles!"</p><p>The Rainbow Rat seemed to be talking to itself, muttering to itself in a cold voice.</p><p>At this moment, the Rainbow Rat was actually possessed by the White-Clothed Man, who had seized its physical body!</p><p>So many experts had been drawn to the desolate island. The White-Clothed Man knew that with his own strength alone, there was absolutely no chance of escaping. He had originally despaired, but unexpectedly discovered that the Rainbow Rat had weakened for some reason.</p><p>The White-Clothed Man came up with a plan, seeing hope.</p><p>He followed the previous plan, using the Ice Box and the spirit array to attract the attention of others. He resolutely abandoned his body, his nascent soul followed the connection of the mark, accurately finding the Rainbow Rat's main body.</p><p>Such tracking secret techniques are double-edged swords.</p><p>Especially when the spellcaster is in a weak state, it is very likely to become a death talisman.</p><p>Back then, the gap between Mu Laomo and Qin Sang's realm was even greater. He used a similar spell to chase and kill Qin Sang, but in the end, Qin Sang used the Fire Curse Seed to lock onto his remnant soul and wipe him out in one fell swoop.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat's main body had not yet completed its transformation and was in a weak state. It was normal for the White-Clothed Man to take advantage of the opportunity.</p><p>It never expected that the White-Clothed Man still had the power to fight back.</p><p>The White-Clothed Man forcibly possessed the Rainbow Rat, temporarily suppressing its consciousness, taking over the leadership, and secretly transmitted sound to the demons such as Bifang, misleading them and leading them to his own body.</p><p>Bifang didn't suspect anything and was indeed fooled.</p><p>The White-Clothed Man then controlled the Rainbow Rat's body and ran away.</p><p>If it weren't for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, an odd variable, the White-Clothed Man would have succeeded. He only needed to be safe, and then he could properly prepare the Rainbow Rat, taking revenge and escaping.</p><p>"Who!"</p><p>The White-Clothed Man occupied the Rainbow Rat's body, and an odd smile appeared on its pointed mouth, suddenly stiffening on his face as he turned around abruptly.</p><p>Behind him, there was a mysterious black-robed man.</p><p>The White-Clothed Man felt as if he had fallen into an ice cellar.</p><p>The black-robed man didn't know when he was trailing behind him, but he hadn't noticed it at all.</p><p>His plan, which he thought was seamless, had already been seen through.</p><p>He noticed that this person was not the Nascent Soul appearing on the wasteland mountain. Could there be a third force, hovering outside the island waiting for an opportunity?</p><p>"No! Wrong!"</p><p>The White-Clothed Man tried to calm himself down and finally found a clue. "Not a cultivator, it's a puppet!"</p><p>As soon as this thought flashed through his mind, the White-Clothed Man suddenly felt a strong wind attacking him and hurriedly dodged.</p><p>This place was already close to the limit of what Qin Sang could sense. He could only issue the most direct orders through the divine sense mark. Having just been chased, he had no politeness to the demons of the North Sea.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Puppet didn't say anything and directly attacked.</p><p>The White-Clothed Man was shocked and hurriedly dodged.</p><p>But he was possessed by the Rainbow Rat and had to distract himself by suppressing the Rainbow Rat's consciousness. He didn't have much strength left, how could he be a match for the Nascent Soul Puppet, and he was immediately in danger.</p><p>'Puh!'</p><p>A big hand broke through the air.</p><p>Seeing that he was about to be ripped open, a white shadow flashed out of the Rainbow Rat's body. It didn't seem to be a Nascent Soul, but a illusory spiritual body.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A thunderbolt came suddenly.</p><p>Seeing that the spiritual body was about to escape, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly took timely action.</p><p>The spiritual body was terrified and hurriedly shrunk back into the Rainbow Rat's body.</p><p>"Tribulation Lightning!"</p><p>The White-Clothed Man was extremely shocked and blurted out, immediately regretting it!</p>
