<h1>Chapter 829: Eighteen Demonic Banners</h1><p>Back at Pointing Finger Peak, Qin Sang had been caught in the conflict between Granny Jing and the Yuan Mirage Sect. He had killed a young disciple of the sect and obtained a fragmented manual titled "Secrets of the Grand Profound Formation," which contained several ingenious spirit formations.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to adapt these formations.</p><p>With more than ten Yama Banners, each possessing the power of a top-grade magical treasure, he knew he had to be extremely cautious and not waste such precious artifacts.</p><p>After verifying the spirit formation, he took out some mid-grade spirit stones and embedded them one by one into the formation. Finally, he placed the high-grade spirit stone in the center.</p><p>'Whoosh... Whoosh...'</p><p>As the spirit stones settled into the formation, the five elements surged in the air. Qin Sang set up a barrier formation around the perimeter to prevent the commotion from alerting other cultivators on the mountain.</p><p>Then, he appeared in the sky above, sitting cross-legged, attempting to control the formation.</p><p>Under his direction, the power of the five elements continuously converged towards the center of the formation, forming a gray chaotic light.  Simultaneously, the spirit stones within the formation flickered, their energy rapidly depleting.</p><p>Qin Sang winced at the sight, no longer hesitating. With a wave of his hand, the Dark Iron Pillar flew into his palm and was then tossed into the spirit formation.</p><p>The Dark Iron Pillar fell into the chaotic light and immediately began to spin rapidly.</p><p>Qin Sang's hand seals changed continuously as the power of the spirit formation surged towards the center, impacting the Dark Iron Pillar.</p><p>At first, there was no visible change.</p><p>Qin Sang remained patient, carefully observing until he finally noticed a slight difference.</p><p>A faint black light shimmered on the surface of the Dark Iron Pillar. Qin Sang understood that this black light was the manifestation of the restrictions within the Dark Iron Pillar, resisting the erosion of the spirit formation.</p><p>The restrictions within the Dark Iron Pillar were incredibly profound and terrifyingly powerful. Even the faint black light emanating from it exerted immense pressure on Qin Sang.</p><p>He didn't dare to 'aggravate' the restrictions and proceeded slowly.</p><p>Although the restrictions were powerful, the Dark Iron Pillar was not intact, broken into two pieces. The break point presented a vulnerability, giving him an opportunity.</p><p>The power of the spirit formation enveloped the Dark Iron Pillar, focusing on the break point, seeping into it.</p><p>As time passed, the black light on the surface of the Dark Iron Pillar intensified. Upon closer inspection, it became clear that it wasn't black light, but the Dark Iron Pillar itself 'melting'!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave. This step was extremely difficult, and his movements were exceptionally gentle, fearing that a single misstep would cause the restrictions within the Dark Iron Pillar to go berserk.</p><p>Not only would the spirit formation be instantly destroyed, but he would also be in grave danger of severe injury.</p><p>During the refining process, feelings of admiration and awe arose within Qin Sang.</p><p>First, for the ancient craftsman who created the Dark Iron Pillar.</p><p>The restrictions within were remarkably intricate, broadening Qin Sang's horizons. Unfortunately, even with the aid of the spirit formation, he only grasped the surface level. However, he was certain that by thoroughly understanding even this superficial knowledge, his refining skills would greatly improve.</p><p>Old Ancestor Kui Yin had also attempted to decipher the restrictions within the Dark Iron Pillar but ultimately gave up.</p><p>He had declared that the object was undoubtedly crafted by a top-tier ancient cultivator, incredibly intricate, a treasure of the ancient cultivators. Even damaged, a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator wouldn't be able to comprehend it.</p><p>Old Ancestor Kui Yin deeply envied the brilliance of the ancient cultivation world, lamenting not being born in that era.</p><p>Second, for Old Ancestor Kui Yin's ingenuity in devising a method to utilize this ancient treasure.</p><p>Unable to break the restrictions of the Dark Iron Pillar, he instead exploited the vulnerability, using skillful force to divide the Dark Iron Pillar, refining it into banner poles to control the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>The 'melted' Dark Iron Pillar resembled a column of black liquid, its surface slightly undulating.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, his divine sense locked onto the Dark Iron Pillar, quickly memorizing the restrictions within. These would be beneficial to his refining skills, to be comprehended later.</p><p>Simultaneously, his hand seals changed continuously as he circulated a secret technique to divide the Dark Iron Pillar.</p><p>After several failed attempts, the Dark Iron Pillar only rippled slightly, unable to be divided into banner poles.</p><p>Exhausted, Qin Sang paused to recover.</p><p>“As expected, my current cultivation is still somewhat lacking. I've wasted a lot of spirit stones. If Old Ancestor Kui Yin were to do this himself, three high-grade spirit stones would suffice.  But it’s not a complete waste. With these failed attempts, subsequent tries will be smoother…”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he sat in meditation.</p><p>Soon, he was fully recovered and continued refining.</p><p>With each attempt, Qin Sang's movements became more proficient, and the ripples on the Dark Iron Pillar grew larger. However, the high-grade spirit stone's luster also dimmed considerably.</p><p>"Condense!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly let out a low growl.</p><p>The Dark Iron Pillar trembled violently. Under Qin Sang's intense gaze, a small section separated, vibrating incessantly, attempting to rejoin the main body.</p><p>Qin Sang stared unblinkingly, his hand seals rapidly changing.</p><p>Finally, the separated section stabilized, reshaping into a banner pole under the influence of the spirit formation.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was overjoyed, but the process wasn't complete yet. He dared not slacken, quickly throwing out a jade bottle containing several trapped beast souls.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>The beast souls broke free from the jade bottle, roaring furiously, attempting to backlash against Qin Sang.</p><p>Prepared for this, Qin Sang flicked his fingers, releasing countless transparent threads of true essence to bind them. Then, he circulated a secret technique to refine them.  Powerless to resist, the beast souls were refined into a crystal and embedded into the banner pole.</p><p>A flash of light, and the banner pole was complete!</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved it, admiring it in his hand. This could be considered the first magical treasure he had refined, a crucial step on the path of refining.</p><p>“Based on this, the Dark Iron Pillar is enough to refine fifteen banner poles, more than enough for the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.  Adding the three I already have, I'll have eighteen demonic banners!”</p><p>Qin Sang calculated silently, utterly astonished.</p><p>Ten demonic banners could barely reach the level of a top-grade magical treasure. What would eighteen represent? Could they achieve the power of the most powerful magical treasures?</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang also understood that with his current cultivation, limited by his true essence and divine sense, he wouldn't be able to control so many banners simultaneously. He would have to wait until he had the treasures in hand to determine how many he could manipulate.</p><p>“I must thoroughly study the 'Secrets of the Grand Profound Formation' later!"</p><p>Amidst his excitement, Qin Sang made up his mind.</p><p>Taking advantage of the remaining energy in the spirit stones, he continued refining, creating another banner pole before the high-grade spirit stone was completely depleted, shattering on the spot.</p><p>The first high-grade spirit stone had only yielded two banner poles, but Qin Sang was confident that at most, three more would suffice.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he stored the Dark Iron Pillar and the spirit formation, then began to comprehend the restrictions he had observed earlier.</p><p>Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months.</p><p>Qin Sang remained diligently cultivating, rarely leaving his cave.</p><p>Half a year had passed since his return to the island when Madam Liu finally reappeared.</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>Qin Sang was cultivating, drawing upon stellar energy to temper his body, when he sensed something. He retrieved a jade pendant from his robes.  The pendant emitted a faint white light. The restriction he had placed on the mortal courtyard had been triggered.</p><p>“It took them long enough. I wonder what news they bring…”</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang ceased his cultivation, donned his cloak, and stepped out.</p>
