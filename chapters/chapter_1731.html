<h1>Chapter 1722: Enlightenment of a Realm</h1><p>The Sweet Dew Monastery issued a formal decree in the name of True Monarch Ganlu.</p><p>Not only the Central Plains sects, but also the top sects of the Western Desert Buddhist Sects, the Northern Wasteland Demonic Sects, and the Eastern Sea Immortal Islands received formal invitations personally drafted by Grandmaster Xingji.</p><p>The location was chosen to be the Ghost Rock Plateau, where the legacy of the Formless Immortal Sect now served as the headquarters of the Tri-Sect Alliance.</p><p>The news caused a stir throughout the cultivation world.</p><p>Finally, another True Monarch had emerged, but for some unknown reason, he hadn't joined a Daoist sect, but instead was involved with the Buddhist sects.</p><p>Further investigation revealed the truth.</p><p>The renowned Daoist Qingfeng was actually an external incarnation of this True Monarch Qin!</p><p>With Qin Sang's breakthrough to Deity Transformation, there was naturally no need to deliberately conceal the relationship between his true body and his incarnation. Those who had witnessed the battle at the Formless Immortal Sect also knew something about it.</p><p>Upon learning this, some were enlightened, while others remained puzzled.</p><p>It was widely known that this True Monarch Qin had been hunted down by the Holy King Qinghu and nearly perished years ago.</p><p>Some believed that Saint Huiguang and the Sweet Dew Monastery cleared Daoist Qingfeng's name out of gratitude for his contributions, to protect him, and to share the pressure from Holy King Qinghu.</p><p>Others questioned why they only cleared the name of his external incarnation if he had made such contributions.</p><p>Only those directly involved knew the inside story. Outsiders could not reach a conclusion through their debates, but they guessed that Saint Huiguang, True Monarch Qin, and Holy King Qinghu must have made some sort of agreement in secret.</p><p>This invitation was considered True Monarch Qin's Deity Transformation ceremony.</p><p>His external incarnation's breakthrough to late Nascent Soul stage was celebrated at the Sweet Dew Monastery. Now, the Deity Transformation ceremony was being held at the Tri-Sect Alliance headquarters. This True Monarch Qin indeed acted unconventionally.</p><p>The Tri-Sect Alliance was now a colossal force in the cultivation world, unshakeable by other powers.</p><p>Originally, all parties hoped that a Deity Transformation cultivator from outside the Tri-Sect Alliance would emerge to counterbalance their influence. Unexpectedly, another True Monarch who was close to the Tri-Sect Alliance appeared.</p><p>Some lamented, while others could see the potential for change.</p><p>The invited sects harbored various thoughts, prepared congratulatory gifts, and hurried to the Ghost Rock Plateau.</p><p>As the winds of change gathered...</p><p>In the South Sea, on a solitary spiritual island far from the mainland...</p><p>At the bottom of a valley on the island, light and shadow flickered, revealing two figures.</p><p>The arrivals were Qin Sang and Grandmaster Xingji.</p><p>In the valley, a novice monk and a Daoist boy were meditating. Seeing the abbot of the Sweet Dew Monastery arrive, they hurriedly rose and bowed.</p><p>It turned out that there was an ancient teleportation formation here that directly reached the South Sea. It was jointly controlled by Buddhists and Daoists and was generally opened only when entering the Immortal Palaces to save time. Usually, a disciple from each sect was left to guard it.</p><p>The two left the island and continued south.</p><p>Grandmaster Xingji led the way until they entered the storm belt. After traveling for another cup of tea, Grandmaster Xingji stopped and pointed to the sea below. "True Monarch Qin, the two Immortal Palaces were here. The two palaces are connected, one named Tian Tong and the other Tian Xiang."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, seeing nothing unusual.</p><p>Like the Seven Kill Palace and the Purple Star Palace, the Central Continent's Immortal Palaces were also within the storm.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, released his divine sense, swept across the void, and probed beneath the sea surface, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>While he searched, Grandmaster Xingji stood quietly beside him, not daring to disturb him.</p><p>Until Qin Sang regained his senses, Grandmaster Xingji couldn't help but ask, "In this world, beyond the Returning Ruins, is there truly an Ascension Platform?"</p><p>"This poor Daoist has seen it with his own eyes. How could it be false?"</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, a hint of fatigue flashing across his face. His divine sense had been greatly depleted.</p><p>Even with the ascension of the Immortal Palaces, he still asked Grandmaster Xingji to bring him here, hoping that, like the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the Ascension Platform would be near the palaces.</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn't find it.</p><p>He learned from Grandmaster Xingji that the Central Continent Immortal Palaces were very different from the Purple Star Palace. There was no distinction between inner and outer palaces here. Even Deity Transformation cultivators had to be extremely cautious when entering the Immortal Palaces, facing terrifying dangers and all sorts of inconceivable beings.</p><p>It sounded somewhat similar to the inner palace of the Seven Kill Palace.</p><p>The Purple Star Palace, on the other hand, only revealed its divine nature as an Immortal Palace at the moment of ascension.</p><p>If the Central Continent Immortal Palaces were placed in the Seven Kill Palace and the North Star Realm, cultivators would be unable to move even a single step in the outer areas, only able to gaze at the Immortal Palaces with longing. The Central Continent cultivation world, with its abundance of experts, was able to discover various immortal blessed lands and superior cultivation techniques, which were continuously passed down thanks to the blessings of the Immortal Palaces.</p><p>Even so, only a small part had been explored over the years.</p><p>Black light flashed in Qin Sang's palm, and an iron chain appeared.</p><p>After Shen Chen reached Nascent Soul, he followed his master's instructions and devoted himself to refining tools, comprehending the Demon Binding Rope fragments within the Meteorite Divine Whip, and repairing the treasure.</p><p>With the genuine Demon Subduing Spirit Formation, repairing the Demon Binding Rope was easier.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, Shen Chen only took a few decades to refine a Demon Binding Rope.</p><p>Although its power was not as great as the true Demon Binding Rope, and there were many areas that needed improvement in Qin Sang's eyes, it already possessed demon-subduing abilities. He truly was exceptionally talented.</p><p>Qin Sang was pleased and imparted his own insights on refining tools, as well as various classics he had obtained in the past, to Shen Chen without reservation, and passed down the Golden Sink Sword to him as encouragement.</p><p>Gently shaking the Demon Binding Rope, Qin Sang recalled how he obtained it. It was in a stone house within an ancient cultivator's legacy, which likely sealed an ancient demon.</p><p>Furthermore, he had also seen an imitation Demon Binding Rope in the Seven Kill Palace, which was probably also refined using fragments.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered Ghost Mother's speculation that the ancient demons outside and the Demon Lords within the Immortal Palaces were not the same. Like her, their cultivation might also be sealed below Deity Transformation.</p><p>After awakening, these ancient demons would surely search for the Ascension Platform. Could it be that they all had to risk traversing the storm and travel tens of thousands of miles to the North Star Realm?</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that there were also Ascension Platforms in the Central Continent and other places, but they were not as conspicuous as the outer palace of the Purple Star Palace. Instead, they were hidden somewhere, waiting for the ancient demons to activate them.</p><p>The purpose of this gathering of various sects was to unite all the forces of this realm, search high and low, find the Ascension Platform, and reopen the path of ascension for this realm!</p><p>Even ascending to the Demon Realm was better than being trapped in a cage.</p><p>This wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision. Before coming here, he had already ordered Great Saint Longjing and other Demon Kings to command all the demon races to search the Eastern Sea.</p><p>The two didn't stay here for long before returning to the Central Plains, heading directly to the Tri-Sect Alliance headquarters.</p><p>Sect Master Yu of the Heavenly Hao Tower and Real Person Hegao Baguanguan were already waiting there.</p><p>Sect Master Yu, with his feather fan and scholar's cap, resembled an elegant scholar rather than a demonic cultivator. "I have long heard of Daoist Friend Qin's great name, but unfortunately, I have never had the chance to meet you. Unexpectedly, our first meeting is with a True Monarch. Truly, a great reputation is well-deserved!"</p><p>With that, Sect Master Yu bowed deeply, his face filled with admiration, and then said with a wry smile, "Elder Fan has encountered a bottleneck and is in secluded cultivation. He is unable to come and pay his respects to the True Monarch. Please forgive him, True Monarch."</p><p>Real Person Hegao also bowed and said ashamedly, "I only caught a glimpse of you back then, unaware of your true identity, True Monarch. This poor Daoist spoke rashly and offended you. Thinking back now, I am filled with shame."</p><p>After speaking, both presented jade slips. "I heard from Grandmaster Xingji that True Monarch desires to find cultivation techniques unearthed from the Immortal Palaces. These are the accumulations of our two sects over the years. Please, True Monarch, offer your guidance."</p><p>Qin Sang accepted them with a smile and said calmly, "Let bygones be bygones. Let us look to the future."</p><p>The path of ascension was difficult, but Qin Sang wouldn't despair, nor would he stop. Searching for various ancient cultivation techniques, he hoped to find some loopholes to exploit, relying on the Jade Buddha to forge a new path and rapidly increase his strength in this realm.</p><p>The two exchanged glances, their expressions softening.</p><p>After Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense from the jade slips, they both bowed and said, "True Monarch, you are chivalrous and righteous. With the path of ascension blocked in this realm, what are your instructions?"</p><p>It turned out that Saint Huiguang had already informed them of the impending changes before his departure.</p><p>That was the reason for the Tri-Sect Alliance.</p><p>For many years, the three powers of Buddhism, Daoism, and Demonic cultivation had maintained a three-legged balance, able to fight without breaking the peace. Naturally, they had a tacit understanding and didn't want to see chaos in the cultivation world.</p><p>They found it hard to believe, but Saint Huiguang had shown them the unnameable Five Elements Crown Demon Spirit, and recalling True Person Zilei's tribulation, they had to believe it.</p><p>"The effectiveness of the Superior Spirit Calming Incense varies from person to person. This poor Daoist cannot guarantee it. However, the matter of the Ascension Platform is certain..."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Real Person Hegao. "When we first met outside the storm belt, this poor Daoist was coming from the North Sea. At the time, I was unaware of the ferocious beasts roaming within the storm belt. Reaching the Central Plains safely was pure luck. This poor Daoist witnessed the Ascension Platform activate with his own eyes, and four people ascended through it."</p><p>Real Person Hegao's expression was complex as he sighed towards the heavens, "Alas, the heavens are blind. Senior Brother, with his unparalleled talent, was born at the wrong time!"</p><p>...</p><p>Soon, all parties arrived as promised, gathering at the Ghost Rock Plateau.</p><p>Qin Sang's original intention was not to hold a Deity Transformation ceremony, but Grandmaster Xingji took it upon himself to organize a celebration almost on par with the Deity Transformation Dharma Assembly of the monastery's ancestors.</p><p>Unable to refuse his kindness, Qin Sang went along with it.</p><p>At the ceremony, Qin Sang appeared with the Sect Master of the Green Goat Sect, the Patriarch of the Xie Family, and the Sect Master of the Tower Terrace Sect.</p><p>The Central Plains' Green Goat Sect stepped into the spotlight for the first time, but only Sect Master Shen appeared. Shen Chen heeded Qin Sang's teachings, acting cautiously and only seeking to get acquainted with prominent figures from all sides.</p><p>Compared to those top powers in the Central Plains, the Green Goat Sect was insignificant and needed to bide its time and build strength.</p><p>At the ceremony, Qin Sang met many old friends.</p><p>There was Hall Master Mu of the Six Continents Hall. He was probably the first to help Qin Sang search for the Ascension Platform, but the capabilities of a merchant association were ultimately limited, and no valuable clues had been found yet.</p><p>There was Sect Master Situ Yu and Grand Elder Lu Zhang of Mount Bunian.</p><p>Lu Zhang had already broken through to late Nascent Soul!</p><p>Reuniting with old friends and witnessing each other's progress brought joy.</p><p>The Water Mirror Seven Islands felt that inviting Daoist Qingfeng as a guest elder was a wise decision.</p><p>There were also those who were not so pleased.</p><p>Such as Poison King, the Sect Master of the Myriad Poison Mountain, and the eminent monks from the Western Desert's Vast Sea.</p><p>After the ceremony, Qin Sang dismissed the irrelevant people and led the leaders of the various sects and factions to the Tri-Sect Alliance's discussion hall.</p><p>Inside the hall, Qin Sang stood with his back to the crowd, hands clasped behind him.</p><p>Grandmaster Xingji, Sect Master Yu, Real Person Hegao, and others stood respectfully by his side.</p><p>A pin drop could be heard.</p><p>Most people were bewildered, gazing at Qin Sang with puzzled eyes, wondering what this True Monarch Qin, who had stirred unrest throughout the cultivation world, was planning to do.</p><p>"This poor Daoist received the kindness of a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect, which led to my achievements today."</p><p>Qin Sang turned around, his first words causing an uproar.</p><p>Even if Xiao Xiangzi wasn't a direct descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect, he definitely had a deep connection to it. Qin Sang's words were not wrong.</p><p>The Buddha Bone Sarira, the three Spirit Calming Incenses, and the Spirit Calming Incense formula had brought him tribulations, but also immense opportunities. Otherwise, he didn't know when he would have reached the threshold of Deity Transformation.</p><p>"Over a hundred years ago, it was a minion of an ancient demon, disguised as a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect, who opened the Formless Immortal Sect legacy, using the name of the Formless Immortal Sect to release the ancient demon sealed in the mountain, not a true descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect. The destruction of the Formless Immortal Sect stemmed from a demonic tribulation. All its descendants dedicated themselves to eradicating demons, but unfortunately, they were misled by the ancient demon's minion and couldn't defend themselves, suffering unjust accusations. Now that the ancient demon has been eliminated and its minions eradicated, we should clear their names today."</p><p>At this grand gathering, all the prominent figures were present, except for the descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect. They had long become frightened birds, and the Hidden Moon Convent only dared to send congratulatory gifts secretly, not daring to appear publicly.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to unite the Central Continent forces to search for the Ascension Platform and couldn't afford to miss the descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect. They definitely knew many unknown secrets, but unfortunately, these secrets disappeared with them.</p><p>One of his goals in orchestrating the internal strife within the demon races was to quickly end the chaos and unite the various races, allowing them to focus on this task.</p><p>Fortunately, the human race was relatively stable, not requiring much effort from Qin Sang. His tolerance of Grandmaster Xingji and his decision not to touch the Tri-Sect Alliance were also to avoid affecting the ascension plan.</p><p>Qin Sang was a hero in subduing demons, and his words were highly credible. Moreover, some had already suspected that he was the Fire Lineage inheritor of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Everyone's expressions varied. Then, they saw Grandmaster Xingji and the other two speak up to confirm his words and jointly swear an oath, clearing the Formless Immortal Sect's name before the world and finally settling that past case.</p><p>This alone wasn't enough to alleviate the descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect's worries, but it could at least lessen the pressure and dispel some of their doubts, allowing them to dare to venture out.</p><p>The destruction of the Formless Immortal Sect was obviously not that simple.</p><p>What roles did the Buddhist, Daoist, and Demonic sects play?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't delve into it. History was better understood broadly than in detail.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang announced another earth-shattering piece of news.</p><p>There were Ascension Platforms in the world, and one didn't need to reach Deity Transformation. Late Nascent Soul cultivators also had a chance!</p><p>For a moment, everyone was utterly shocked, their burning gazes almost igniting Qin Sang's robes.</p><p>What did an Ascension Platform represent? Everyone knew.</p><p>Late Nascent Soul was difficult, but compared to Deity Transformation, it was much easier!</p><p>"Ferocious beasts have emerged from their nests, and the changes in the Returning Ruins are still unknown. Saint Huiguang and Holy King Qinghu have embarked on an eastward journey, their future uncertain. This poor Daoist remains, seeking another path. After this meeting, this poor Daoist will travel to other realms to spread this information, striving to unite the cultivators of this world and search for the Ascension Platform together. Working together, I believe we can definitely find a way out for the cultivators of this realm!"</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly, "This poor Daoist can swear an oath before all of you. I have personally witnessed someone ascend through an Ascension Platform in another realm. Unfortunately, I didn't understand the details at the time, and the Ascension Platform was unexpectedly destroyed. However, I believe there is a high probability of another Ascension Platform existing in the Central Continent, requiring everyone's cooperation to search for it."</p><p>"Breaking through the void is extremely dangerous. Can the Ascension Platform truly protect us?" someone asked.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "It provides a certain degree of protection. Late Nascent Soul cultivators have a one in ten chance of survival, but think about it, isn't breaking through to Deity Transformation the same?"</p><p>Back then, Old Demon Ye and the others used the Immortal Palace to resist the spatial turbulence. Now, they could only rely on their own abilities.</p><p>"How many people can the Ascension Platform hold? If it's destroyed after one use, wouldn't we be paving the way for others? What if someone finds the Ascension Platform and keeps it a secret?" someone asked directly.</p><p>Qin Sang answered frankly, "The Ascension Platform does have limitations, and activating it is not easy. Only this poor Daoist knows the activation method. At that time, this poor Daoist will bring the Daoist friends with the greatest contributions to ascend together, and before leaving, I will leave behind the ascension method and the experience of resisting spatial turbulence. Learning from the last lesson, this poor Daoist guarantees that the Ascension Platform will not be destroyed and can swear an oath before all of you."</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang answered many questions before moving to a side hall.</p><p>The main hall was still in an uproar.</p><p>Grandmaster Xingji and the other two invited a few more people in.</p><p>Including Poison King, Situ Yu, the Sect Master of the Dragon Dwelling Grotto-Heaven, and the Sect Master of the Jade Shadow Sect.</p><p>All were top experts of this realm, with their cultivation at the peak or nearing completion.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to Grandmaster Xingji.</p><p>Grandmaster Xingji began to tell them about the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound.</p><p>Qin Sang watched quietly. This was partly to motivate them to search for the Ascension Platform with all their might, and partly to prevent anyone from attempting a breakthrough unprepared, resulting in unnecessary casualties. With sufficient preparation in the future, perhaps someone could survive the breakthrough to Deity Transformation and become his aide.</p><p>If they couldn't find the Ascension Platform, they would eventually have to venture into the Returning Ruins.</p><p>As others' cultivation caught up, he would inform them gradually.</p><p>Saint Huiguang and Holy King Qinghu were impatient, but Qin Sang, protected by the Jade Buddha, was not in a hurry.</p><p>The Green Goat Sect was still weak, relying on Deer Field. Regardless of the changes in the cultivation world, it wouldn't greatly affect his legacy, so Qin Sang didn't have many concerns or attachments.</p><p>Although there was the Demonic Sound blocking the path, there was also the Ascension Platform. Hope remained, and these people wouldn't fall into despair and act recklessly.</p><p>Everything was for ascension!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
