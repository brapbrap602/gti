<h1>Chapter 481: The spoils of victory</h1><p>Ji Wu was among the five, but he hadn't appeared yet!</p><p>The beam of light grew thinner and thinner, about to vanish completely.</p><p>At that moment, the beam violently fluctuated, and a blurry figure suddenly emerged, forcing its way out just as the mirror was about to disappear.</p><p>The person looked extremely disheveled, barely managing to escape as the Zhi Tian Peak was closing.  He stumbled, falling into the water.</p><p>After he surfaced and his face was visible,</p><p>a sigh went through the Tian Xing Alliance's ranks.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, his relaxed expression vanishing.  It was Ji Wu!</p><p>He had thought Ji Wu was dead, a major problem solved, but unexpectedly, he had emerged at the last moment.</p><p>Ji Wu was breathing heavily, his robe torn, his left arm limp. He had barely escaped with his life; even when he reached Granny Jing, he was still gasping for air.</p><p>For someone of his cultivation level, this was an uncommonly pathetic state.</p><p>Even more surprising was the number of starstones Ji Wu produced – over three hundred.</p><p>Excluding Qin Sang, Ji Wu had the most!</p><p>Everyone silently looked at Ji Wu.  His late arrival clearly indicated he had faced great peril. His injuries and tattered robes sparked speculation.</p><p>Upon learning he wasn't first, Ji Wu's disappointment was evident. He glanced at Qin Sang and silently retreated into the crowd.</p><p>At this point, the light beam completely vanished. The water's surface was calm, leaving no trace of Zhi Tian Peak's existence.</p><p>The Snake Granny tapped her snake staff; pouches containing starstones lined up before her.  She then announced loudly, “The winner is clear, isn't it?”</p><p>The golden-armored general snorted, gathered all the starstones, and turned, letting out an angry shout: “Useless bunch!”</p><p>With a stomp, the golden-armored general transformed into a golden light and disappeared.</p><p>The Tian Xing Alliance members exchanged glances, their faces downcast and ashamed. They left without a word.</p><p>…</p><p>Guanxi Island.</p><p>The Snake Granny was in a good mood, smiling as she spoke encouraging words to the crowd. Then she signaled the deputy island master to bring out the rewards.</p><p>Ten beams of light appeared again.</p><p>This time, the ownership of these treasures was already clear.</p><p>Those ineligible could only watch enviously.</p><p>Most of the envious gazes were directed at Qin Sang.</p><p>“As agreed, the ten individuals with the most starstones from the Zhi Tian Peak expedition will select treasures: Shao Hua Mountain's Qin Sang, Mo Yan Sect's Ji Wu…”</p><p>Brother Rong was not among them.</p><p>After naming Qin Sang and others, the Snake Granny continued with a smile: “Your contributions to defeating the Tian Xing Alliance are considerable.  Guanxing Island will reward each of you with a top-grade magical artifact. Choose freely.”</p><p>With a wave, the Snake Granny produced dozens of streams of light, a dazzling array of various magical artifacts.</p><p>This scene reminded Qin Sang of his time at Kui Yin Sect, when Yi Tiannie forced him to become a traitor – a memory from decades past, yet still vivid.</p><p>It had been the greatest crisis of his life, but also the greatest turning point on his immortal path.</p><p>Blessings and misfortunes intertwine.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a sense of profound reflection.</p><p>The experts present didn’t particularly value top-grade artifacts, but it was better than nothing – a pleasant surprise.  Smiles appeared on their faces as they selected their preferred artifacts.</p><p>“Qin Sang!”</p><p>After the others had chosen, the Snake Granny pointed at Qin Sang. “You're first.  You choose.”</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and, amidst many disappointed gazes, said without hesitation, “I choose the Snow Spirit Lotus and the Iris Flower.”</p><p>The Snake Granny wasn't surprised.  With a gesture, the two medicinal herbs flew to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Snow Spirit Lotus emanated a cool fragrance; the Iris Flower, conversely, radiated warmth.</p><p>Sealed with restrictions to preserve their spiritual essence, Qin Sang's breathing quickened as he held them carefully, placing them in his storage pouch.</p><p>He could feel a few unfriendly eyes on him, but he was unafraid. No one dared to act rashly within the Zhen Shui Qian Huan array.</p><p>Even outside the Luan Island waters, he feared no one.</p><p>“Next, Ji Wu!”</p><p>The Snake Granny's voice startled Qin Sang. He looked at Ji Wu, who was eyeing the Xuan Zhen Pill – second only to the two herbs – with a hesitant expression.</p><p>Ultimately, he made an unexpected choice.</p><p>“I’ll take the Gui Fu Pill!”</p><p>Ji Wu's voice caused an uproar.</p><p>Gui Fu Dan might be more valuable than Xuan Zhen Dan, but for cultivators at the False Core stage, any healing or core-formation assisting elixirs are incomparably better.</p><p>The cultivators behind Ji Wu, after their initial surprise, were instantly overjoyed.</p><p>She-Po was also somewhat surprised, but didn't ask further questions, handing the Gui Fu Dan to Ji Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang watched silently as Ji Wu put away the Gui Fu Dan, a sudden urgency rising in her heart.  Gui Fu Dan was unlike other healing elixirs; it was equally effective against injuries suffered by Core Formation cultivators.  </p><p>Such an elixir would cause a sensation at any auction.</p><p>The hooded cultivator had been collecting healing elixirs for years; his injuries must have partially healed already. If he were to obtain the Gui Fu Dan…</p><p>Qin Sang's hands clenched.</p><p>For a moment, the joy of obtaining two spirit herbs was greatly diminished.</p><p>Soon, all the treasures found their owners.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others took their leave, leaving only the two island masters in the hall.</p><p>“Senior Chifa and the Tianxing Alliance have a wagered duel. Now that the Foundation Establishment disciples' duel is over, we must prepare for the second round. How will this be arranged? Will we dismiss the other disciples and only keep a few behind?”</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao inquired softly.</p><p>She-Po shook her head.  “The Tianxing Alliance won't retreat easily! Besides, how we will conduct the duel hasn't been decided yet. Senior Chifa sent me a message earlier.  This round was evenly matched, a great opportunity for the disciples of each sect to hone their skills. We don't need to retreat; we will stay here, sending troops once every ten days to engage the Tianxing Alliance. We'll sound the retreat only after the Ziwei Palace opens.”</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao pondered, sighing, “Training is good, but casualties are unavoidable.  Even on the relatively safe Zhi Tian Peak, four promising disciples lost their lives, one of them being a nephew of mine…”</p><p>She-Po didn't share his sentiment.</p><p>“It's fate.  There's no point blaming anyone.  You can't protect him for his whole life, Daoist Xiao. How many cultivators in the past had better talent than you and me? How many remain now? Daoist Leng Yun Tian was less talented than us, yet he is now a Nascent Soul cultivator and sect leader.”</p><p>“Him?”</p><p>A look of disdain flashed in Deputy Island Master Xiao's eyes, but he said nothing more.</p><p>The two discussed further before departing.</p><p>…</p><p>After leaving Guan Xing Island, Qin Sang declined all invitations, exchanged a few pleasantries with Senior Rong and others, and amidst a flurry of congratulations, flew back to her cave dwelling.</p><p>After closing her cave, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, lost in thought.</p><p>(Lately, many readers from a certain site have been advertising in the comments section.</p><p>I don't object to advertising; I even want to advertise elsewhere.
