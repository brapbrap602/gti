<h1>Chapter 1959: Dire News</h1><p>The Fire Domain.</p><p>Here, even the wind takes the shape of flame.</p><p>Fierce flames, like those floating on the surface of magma, roar past, then vanish.</p><p>Above and below, only crimson is visible.</p><p>Occasionally, in the magma, strange shapes flash by, like splashes of water.</p><p>This is a pure ocean of magma; not a single piece of land is visible. Only fire beasts with special bloodlines, and fire spirits born of the flames, can survive here.</p><p>They fear nothing here, moving freely through the magma like fish.</p><p>Suddenly, the fiery wind stills for a moment, revealing two faint figures.</p><p>These two are Ling Shi and Gui Hou.</p><p>Gui Hou has a fire jade centipede coiled around his arm, seemingly communicating with it before pointing downwards.</p><p>“Friend Ling, this is the place! Lord Zhuque mentioned it before.  Some Black Demon Lilies grow beneath this magma.  But I wonder if their medicinal properties will meet your requirements.”</p><p>“Black Demon Lilies thrive where the fire energy is most intense and volatile, absorbing fire poison as nourishment. Their environment greatly affects their quality. If I were using them, high-grade Black Demon Lilies would suffice. But this time, I need to refine a potent poison as requested, requiring the utmost quality.”</p><p>Ling Shi subtly twitched his nose, using a secret technique to sense his surroundings, before nodding.  “This place is good; it has the potential to nurture top-quality Black Demon Lilies. Let's go, let's have a look!”</p><p>The two plunged downwards, the magma parting to either side before instantly closing again, returning to normal.</p><p>The magma is bottomless.</p><p>Gui Hou leads the way, descending continuously, transmitting his voice, “Friend Ling, how many plants do you estimate will reach top quality in this entire field? How many are needed for the poison?”</p><p>“The more, the better!” Ling Shi replied.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Gui Hou frowned, “In the entire Fire Domain, such places are probably rare. And once a certain scale is reached, they’re likely to be secured. The three major sects of the Fire Domain are all adept at fire magic, and there are many other large and small forces. Even if they don't cultivate Black Demon Lilies, they could easily turn such places into medicinal fields.”</p><p>“Let's do our best, it's not the only option! Besides, our master is incredibly powerful, surely he has a way. If he wants to unify the Fire Domain, it would be effortless, wouldn't it?” Ling Shi said lightly.</p><p>Since being brought back by Qin Sang, Ling Shi, initially apprehensive, now felt at ease.</p><p>Here, he could focus solely on his poison arts, researching various potent poisons. Qin Sang would fully support him, whatever the requirements.</p><p>Such treatment was usually reserved for master alchemists.</p><p>Although there’s a saying that alchemy and poison making are inseparable, Ling Shi did understand some alchemy, but the poison cultivation he practiced wasn't purely about creating poisons, and lacking an alchemic lineage, he couldn't compare to a true master alchemist.</p><p>The price was restricted freedom, but he was already targeted by the Soulfall Abyss, he had no choice.</p><p>Gui Hou couldn’t be as carefree as Ling Shi, shaking his head. “That may be so, but as subordinates, we must do our best to relieve our master's worries.”</p><p>As they spoke, the two descended to an extreme depth.</p><p>The temperature didn't decrease; instead, the intense, volatile aura of creation became even stronger.</p><p>Gradually, the magma became invisible to the naked eye, transforming into pure streams of fire flowing from all directions towards them.</p><p>It's unimaginable what kind of apocalyptic scene would unfold if this power were to erupt.</p><p>“Fire Domain cultivators call this a Flame Pool. The fire energy undergoes transformation here. Within such a powerful Flame Pool, we must be cautious.  The Black Demon Lilies are connected to the Flame Pool's energy, so we must be careful when harvesting them, lest we provoke the Flame Pool's fury.”</p><p>Gui Hou warned.</p><p>As they spoke, they descended further, deliberately slowing their pace.</p><p>The surrounding scenery changed dramatically, and even the two Nascent Soul stage experts felt a primal pressure.</p><p>Without warning, the surroundings suddenly calmed.</p><p>There were no turbulent flows here.</p><p>In the stillness, however, a strange feeling arose, as if immense power was pent up, ready to erupt and destroy everything.</p><p>There was fire here too, burning quietly. The flames were a pale blue, gently swaying, giving a delicate impression.</p><p>They cautiously entered this space, avoiding the flames, and soon found a shadowed area within the blue flames.</p><p>The shadows weren't completely dark; they emitted a dark blue light.</p><p>In a radiant glow, scattered dark blue lilies floated. Some petals were deep, others lighter.</p><p>There was no soil; they hung suspended, their roots clearly visible, countless blue tendrils reaching into the flames, drawing sustenance.</p><p>“One, two…five superior Black Magic Lilies!”</p><p>Ling Shi’s face lit up; he'd expected at most two or three.</p><p>He moved to a superior Black Magic Lily, extending his right hand towards the root ball.</p><p>His fingers moved slightly, a strange energy emanating, enveloping the root ball.</p><p>Ling Shi focused intently, his movements gentle yet decisive. He carefully lifted the root ball, patiently extracting each root from the flames.</p><p>Harvesting one Black Magic Lily took about ten days.</p><p>Gui Hou, observing him retrieve a complete plant, offered assistance.</p><p>As they concentrated on harvesting, a sudden feeling made them pause and exchange a look.</p><p>“Someone’s coming!” Gui Hou said gravely.</p><p>This magma region teemed with countless fire beasts and spirits, inherently chaotic.  Their herb gathering in the Yan Pool couldn't detect every fluctuation.  A mere passerby wouldn't disturb them.</p><p>This arrival was different; someone fleeing, desperately plunging into their space.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi remained calm, tracking the intruder's movement through the energy shifts.</p><p>“Not coming here,” Gui Hou said, his expression easing.</p><p>Before the words left his mouth, they sensed another presence, rapidly approaching.</p><p>Ling Shi murmured agreement, then exclaimed in surprise, “Two Nascent Soul cultivators!”</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators were rare in the Fire Domain; encountering two at once, locked in pursuit, was unusual.</p><p>“Maybe from the Three Sects of the Fire Domain, but it's none of our concern.  Let's focus,” Gui Hou shook his head, noticing Ling Shi's changed expression.</p><p>“That one behind… is a corpse demon from Fallen Soul Abyss!”</p><p>Ling Shi's eyes flashed, a cold smile playing on his lips. “Those inhuman things, their stench penetrates even the magma!”</p><p>…</p><p>Above.</p><p>A streak of crimson light zipped through the magma.</p><p>Inside was a muscular man. Qin Sang would recognize him: Fu Xiao of the Six Harmonies Sect, whom Qin Sang's avatar had lured there after destroying the sand bandits.</p><p>Now, Fu Xiao's powerful frame was stooped, his face pale, clearly badly injured.</p><p>A bloody hole gaped in his chest, tearing through his robes.</p><p>The wound nearly pierced his back, causing severe internal damage.</p><p>Worse than the injury was the green flame clinging to it like a malignant growth, preventing healing, devouring his life force, rendering any medicinal treatment useless.</p><p>‘Huff! Huff! Huff!’</p><p>During his flight, Fu Xiao muttered incantations, spewing a ball of spiritual fire.</p><p>It clashed with the green flame, but failed to extinguish it.</p><p>Repeated attempts only temporarily suppressed it.</p><p>Worse, he discovered the green flame silently invading his innards.</p><p>Normally, he had several ways to extinguish it, but his injuries, and the pursuing enemy, left him helpless.</p><p>He calculated the distance to his sect, growing more frantic.  At this rate, he’d die before reaching safety.</p><p>He’d accidentally stumbled upon the corpse demons, only to fall prey to an ambush.  His communication artifact was destroyed; he was completely isolated.</p><p>Behind, a chilling aura pursued relentlessly.</p><p>A green flame, highly visible in the magma, followed.</p><p>Fu Xiao, skilled in his sect's techniques, moved through the magma with incredible speed, yet the green flame kept pace!</p><p>Within the green flame was a figure, even larger than Fu Xiao, one of the individuals Qin Sang had roused when activating the bronze pillar.</p><p>The others were gone; only this giant pursued him relentlessly.</p><p>“Hmph! If Lord Fei Luo hadn’t returned to report, and Rou Ji hadn't been injured, you wouldn't have escaped!  You’ll stay here!”</p><p>The giant man roared, his robes billowing as green flames engulfed him, transforming him into a fiery figure.</p><p>Green fire spread, instantly dyeing the surrounding magma green.  The green magma instantly shifted from scorching heat to icy cold.</p><p>The green fire spread incredibly fast.  Fu Xiao had only just noticed something was wrong when he was surrounded by the green magma, an instinctive warning flaring up.</p><p>Without warning, a bone-white ghostly claw emerged from the green fire. Its five fingers, sharp as blades, clawed towards his back.</p><p>If he'd been struck, Fu Xiao would have been in grave danger.</p><p>Fortunately, he was prepared. A fiery red pattern, resembling a Bagua but with subtle differences, appeared on his back, formed from flames.</p><p>As the Bagua fire pattern appeared, a muffled thunderclap echoed.</p><p>The ghostly claw struck, causing the fire pattern to violently shake and crack, but it managed to hold the claw back for a moment.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the opportunity to dash forward, expecting to put distance between himself and his pursuer, but then felt a chilling wind.</p><p>The ghostly claw, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, materialized in front of him, aiming for his face.</p><p>Fu Xiao was terrified, but amidst his panic, a ruthless determination shone in his eyes. He opened his mouth, not spitting fire, but a pearl.</p><p>This pearl possessed an exceptionally brilliant luster.  It was called the Chi Xi Pearl, a treasure Fu Xiao relied heavily upon.  Now, to escape, he had to destroy it.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Chi Xi Pearl shot towards the ghostly claw. The claw immediately sensed the danger and curled its fingers, preparing to retreat into the green magma.</p><p>But the claw was too close to Fu Xiao, and he'd planned this precisely. His timing was impeccable.</p><p>With a *boom*, the Chi Xi Pearl exploded, a fiery serpent entwined with fragments, clawing and slashing its way out.</p><p>A roar erupted from the magma. The ghostly claw, unable to escape in time, simply left its position. Its five fingers suddenly spread, revealing a black eye embedded in its palm, rotating like a living thing – utterly uncanny.</p><p>The eye blinked, shooting a black ray from its pupil towards the fiery serpent formed from the Chi Xi Pearl's explosion.</p><p>The moment the two forces collided, a figure vaguely emerged behind the ghostly claw, recoiling backward.</p><p>The Chi Xi Pearl's power was immense, instantly destroying the black ray.</p><p>The tall man appeared quite disheveled, but not seriously injured; he had mostly avoided the blast.</p><p>However, the green fire that had contaminated the magma was now waning.</p><p>Fu Xiao took the opportunity to escape, flicking his sleeve, sending several streams of light towards his enemy.  Without looking back at the result, he chose a direction and fled with all his might.</p><p>He remembered the ruins of a Liuhe Gate site from thousands of years ago.</p><p>The brief fight had sharply aggravated Fu Xiao's injuries. He knew that relying solely on his own strength, escaping was almost impossible.</p><p>He hoped the ruins still existed – that would be his only hope!</p><p>…</p><p>Elsewhere.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi temporarily stopped gathering herbs and quietly left the Yanchi.</p><p>They didn’t get too close to the battle, but based on the energy fluctuations, they could figure out what was happening.</p><p>“It's the Diancang Technique of the Liuhe Gate!” Gui Hou rarely went out, but he knew about the surrounding forces, especially the three sects of the Fire Domain.</p><p>“A corpse demon from Luohun Abyss pursuing a Liuhe Gate expert here – don't you find this strange?”</p><p>Ling Shi was eager to act.  “Luohun Abyss is extending its influence into the Fire Domain again, undoubtedly with a large conspiracy!  We should investigate thoroughly and be prepared, lest we disturb the cultivation of our seniors!”</p><p>Gui Hou glanced at Ling Shi.  He knew Ling Shi had a feud with Luohun Abyss and wanted to take revenge.</p><p>Ling Shi's words held some truth.</p><p>But Gui Hou also considered whether their interference might attract the ancestor of Luohun Abyss, when there was originally no conflict.</p><p>Gui Hou followed Qin Sang from the Talisman Realm to the Grand Thousand World, and knew Qin Sang's breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage wasn't through conventional means. Facing a true Nascent Soul cultivator, they might not stand a chance. They should consolidate their foundation and delay contact as much as possible.</p><p>“Don’t worry, this fellow isn’t that important in Luohun Abyss.  There must be more than just him infiltrating the Fire Domain. The Old Demon has several late Nascent Soul-stage demons under him; the loss of a single corpse demon wouldn't even cause him to blink,” Ling Shi stated confidently.</p><p>Just as they were arguing, a voice suddenly reached them.</p><p>They immediately stopped, their expressions turning respectful.  After listening for a moment, they bowed to the void.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Only after the voice disappeared did they straighten up.</p><p>Ling Shi laughed. “As expected, our senior has already seen through everything!”</p><p>Gui Hou remained noncommittal. He looked ahead and hurried after them.  “Friend Ling, we need to discuss a plan.  Our master requires a live capture, we must be absolutely certain of success. We will rely on your poisonous arts from here on.”</p><p>“Certainly! Luohun Abyss corpse demons have been cultivating corpse poison for years.  Ordinary poisons are ineffective against them, but mine is different. I will ensure he doesn't leave alive!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the cultivation ground.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body sat cross-legged on a stone bed, surrounded by twinkling stars.</p>
