<h1>Chapter 2179: Cooperation</h1><p>Qin Sang and Liuli ignored the small figure behind them and dashed into the storm. The figure gazed deeply at their backs before speaking again, merging into the spirit grass, which then withered and disappeared.</p><p>Everywhere was toxic mist, broken ancient prohibitions, and the shockwaves from the radiant light.  Chaos reigned as far as the eye could see.</p><p>With the help of the Tianmu butterfly, Qin Sang found a way forward and safely traversed the most dangerous area.  Ahead, in the red mist, numerous orbs appeared.</p><p>These orbs were scattered, emitting familiar waves and light—fragments of the Bi Xie Palace.  They needed to jump across these fragments, a far safer task than before.</p><p>Seeing that the surroundings were less dangerous, both relaxed a little. Liuli opened her lips slightly and asked, "Qin Daoyou, do you believe what that person said?"</p><p>"The so-called opportunity from the destruction of the Sacred Land?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked in return.</p><p>Liuli nodded.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment, then said, "It's too absurd, lacking evidence to be believable. However, if that person is right, and the ancestors of the Yi people left guidance within the Sacred Land, we outsiders are undoubtedly at a disadvantage."</p><p>"Qin Daoyou is worried that this opportunity is related to the Heart Lake?" Liuli mused.</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "Exactly! The Heart Lake is the beginning of the change, the source of the radiant light, located in the very center of the Sacred Land.  No matter how you look at it, it's the most unique place in the Sacred Land, and we must enter the Heart Lake to find that secret realm.  Even if we wish to remain peaceful, the Heart Lake will inevitably become a contested area among the powerful. Even if we don't intend to compete for opportunities, we'll be treated as competitors and forced into battle."</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's words, Liuli showed no surprise, indicating she had the same thought.  She said, "So Qin Daoyou has been persuaded by that person and wants to explore the Bi Xie Palace?"</p><p>"Let's play it by ear.  To wage war over a vague legend is not wise. Even if the legend proves true, there are so many Yi clans; we'll find another opportunity later…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the deep pit below.  His view was blocked by the fragments of the Bi Xie Palace. Their current goal was to find a path to the Silent Space and the Thunder Palace.</p><p>Sensing Liuli had more to say, Qin Sang continued, "What is your opinion, Immortal?"</p><p>"That person is untrustworthy; his actions are odd!"</p><p>Liuli said gravely, "Knowing we were ahead of him and might reach the goal first, he didn't expose our whereabouts, but instead revealed the supposed great opportunity. Clearly, he's tempting us to pave the way for him, not as he said, to work together to drive away the Jie Gou cultivators. Either there's danger ahead, or the Jie Gou cultivators are very strong, and this person is confident he can reap the benefits.  He'll undoubtedly continue to stir things up secretly.  A major battle likely awaits us."</p><p>Liuli's words coincided perfectly with Qin Sang's thoughts.  But to retreat now and avoid trouble felt unwilling.</p><p>This was the only known place nearby that might lead to the Silent Space. Entering the Silent Space, they might find the Heart Lake; swift action was key to gaining the advantage.</p><p>To retreat now would mean an unknown delay before finding another such place.</p><p>"Immortal, what is your strategy?"</p><p>Liuli replied, "In other places, I might be able to help Qin Daoyou. But I'm not adept at poison control. The deeper we go, the more powerful the toxic mist and prohibitions become. If we fight there, I'd be hampered and might even endanger Qin Daoyou."</p><p>Surprise flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, "Immortal's meaning is…"</p><p>"Qin Daoyou should go down alone. Without any encumbrances, you'll be able to come and go freely. With your strength, even without outside help, you have a chance to succeed. I'll leave a clone beside you to distract attention.  If necessary, you can use it as bait," Liuli, who already had a plan, blurted out.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. Liuli's self-awareness and clear judgment would indeed allow him more freedom.  However, it would not be easy for Liuli's clone to deceive those powerful cultivators.  Even with the power of the Ce Yi Heavenly Emperor Talisman, comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator, her divine abilities were still unrefined, and possessed many flaws.</p><p>"Although the clone is made of ice, it can integrate the power of the Ce Yi Heavenly Emperor Talisman, making it difficult for others to see through. I can also seal a technique within the clone's body to make it even more realistic…"</p><p>Liuli explained.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. Liuli's most unique feature was the aura of the Ce Yi Heavenly Emperor Talisman, which could block the scrutiny of others.  As long as this unique aura remained, there was a chance to deceive everyone.</p><p>As Liuli said, taking her clone would attract the attention of ill-intentioned individuals, and it could be used as a shield against danger.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed, "Following the fairy's plan. However, we can't leave now, so you'll have to stay here alone. Be careful."</p><p>Liuli looked around and said, "I have a profound ice-sealing technique.  If you create a protective barrier for me, we can completely isolate ourselves from the poisonous mist. After you leave, I will act accordingly."</p><p>This ice-sealing technique has the drawback of limited mobility, but it's a highly effective defensive spell. It forms ice around the user, creating an impenetrable barrier.  Not only will it block the poisonous mist, but also the shockwaves from the light.  It can only be broken if the surrounding area is completely destroyed.</p><p>Hidden, Liuli could wait for an opportunity. If Qin Sang encountered a strong opponent, she could lure them over and fight together.</p><p>"First, let's find a secluded, safe place..."</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>The young man in white robes might arrive soon, so they had to act quickly. Qin Sang changed direction, flying towards the edge of the debris field with Liuli, until they found a large hall fragment.</p><p>The hall was dilapidated, but its protective arrays were still intact, capable of withstanding external shocks.  The treasures had long been looted, so others wouldn't examine it closely – a perfect hiding place.</p><p>Liuli closed her eyes, a blue light appearing on her forehead.  An ice crystal flew out, radiating cold energy and condensing a cloud of mist that gently rotated before her.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The crystal shattered, the cold mist instantly expanding several times, countless tiny ice shards swirling within.</p><p>The mist then parted, revealing a figure identical to Liuli in appearance and demeanor.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could still discern subtle flaws. Others might not have his keen eye, but anyone skilled in detection could easily see through the illusion.</p><p>Liuli and her illusion faced each other, changing hand seals.  A divine light appeared behind them, revealing images of Yun Hai Immortal Palace and an imperial figure. Gou Chen Shang Di pointed at the illusion, instantly altering its aura, making it almost indistinguishable from the real Liuli.</p><p>It was certain that the Heavenly Emperor Talisman was at least a fourth-order, perhaps even higher. This fueled Qin Sang's desire for higher-order talismans. Unfortunately, the Five Thunder Envoy's Seal was incomplete; he only possessed one fourth-order Thunder Oath Talisman.</p><p>After creating the illusion, Liuli calmed her breath, nodded to Qin Sang, then a cold light flowed over her body, rapidly encasing her in a layer of profound ice.</p><p>The ice grew thicker, encasing Liuli completely. Then Qin Sang activated the protective barrier, sealing the ice.</p><p>With everything prepared, Liuli's illusion went with Qin Sang, while the real Liuli retreated into the hall.</p><p>With the illusion, Qin Sang continued to explore, soon encountering a relatively intact hall.</p><p>This hall had also been visited.  Qin Sang found a weak point in the protective array, searched the hall, but found no useful clues.</p><p>As he exited, his expression changed.  He looked towards a corner of the hall, coldly snorted, and shouted, "Come out!"</p><p>A figure emerged—the young man in white robes.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. "It's you! When did you get in?"</p><p>The young man laughed. "Shortly after you two entered.  You were very fast; I had quite a chase."</p><p>"What about the Xie Gou cultivator?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked back, sensing no fleeing cultivator. Had the Xie Gou cultivator fallen?  He needed to re-evaluate the white-robed youth's strength.</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>The young man smirked. "That fellow likely thought I'd been driven away and is diligently acting as a watchdog outside!"</p><p>"Impressive, I admire your skill!"</p><p>Qin Sang was genuinely impressed. He wondered how the man managed to deceive the Xie Gou cultivator.</p><p>The young man's laughter ceased, and he spoke seriously. "I am Xie Tianjiao. May I know your names?"</p><p>"I am Qingfeng," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Liuli remained silent, standing coldly behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Xie Tianjiao glanced at Liuli without questioning further, and turned back to Qin Sang. "Now that I'm in, I wonder if Daoist Qingfeng has considered my previous proposal?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied calmly, "Your proposal is pure speculation. It's too early to discuss cooperation. We need to see for ourselves before considering it. However, our goal is the same – to reach the deepest part of this place. We could cooperate."</p><p>"Very well!  Actions speak louder than words.  In due time, you will see the truth!"</p><p>Xie Tianjiao was very accommodating.</p><p>Qin Sang, Xie Tianjiao, and Liuli continued their descent. Liuli followed Qin Sang, while Xie Tianjiao walked alongside them, maintaining a respectful distance.</p><p>Whenever they encountered an obstacle, Qin Sang and Xie Tianjiao would take action. Liuli, remaining within her protective barrier,  watched passively, seemingly unwilling to risk exposure to the poisonous mist.  Her intervention proved unnecessary; Qin Sang and Xie Tianjiao worked effectively as a team.</p><p>Qin Sang covertly observed Xie Tianjiao, noting his constant manipulation of a round cauldron. This cauldron appeared to absorb the poisonous mist, gaining power in the process, unleashing considerable force when activated.  However, its power seemed limited, possibly due to Xie Tianjiao deliberately concealing his strength.  Meanwhile, Xie Tianjiao was also observing them.</p><p>After breaching another obstacle, Qin Sang rejoined Liuli, who hadn't left her protective barrier throughout their journey.</p><p>"This fairy seems to lack proficiency in antidotal methods," Xie Tianjiao remarked, offering a jade pendant. "I happen to have an antidote amulet.  It might make things easier for her. However," he added, "I'll need you to entrust me with a precious artifact first.  It's not that I distrust you, but prudence dictates caution among strangers."</p><p>Liuli gave him a cold look.</p><p>Qin Sang declined politely. "Thank you for your kindness, Daoist.  If the fairy feared the mist, I would not have brought her here. We're conserving our strength for the deeper dangers ahead."</p><p>"I see," Xie Tianjiao said, his eyes flashing as he pocketed the amulet.</p><p>The trio continued their advance, encountering numerous obstacles, yet they still hadn't seen any of the E Gou tribe.</p><p>Qin Sang asked, "Daoist Xie, do you know how many powerful E Gou warriors have entered this place?"</p><p>"I only saw the E Gou chieftain and one other outside," Xie Tianjiao replied.  "The E Gou are not a powerful tribe. Their chieftain is only at the mid-stage of the Void Realm, a level comparable to ours.  They wouldn't have many experts, and some may have been injured by the celestial light.  I suspect the chieftain may be alone now, with any injured tribe members having already left the sacred grounds during the celestial fissure."</p><p>"Only the chieftain?" Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>"Don't underestimate him, Daoist Qingfeng!" Xie Tianjiao warned. "The traces we've encountered clearly indicate the chieftain's intimate familiarity with this place, and his ability to manipulate the barriers.  He's not to be taken lightly…"</p><p>Before Xie Tianjiao finished, they came upon a large hall blocking their path.  Surprisingly, the hall was mostly intact, its doors closed, and its treasures untouched.  It seemed the chieftain deemed the hall too difficult to open and bypassed it, having looted the damaged halls previously. This indicated the chieftain couldn't freely manipulate the barriers as they initially thought.  Seeing an opportunity, Qin Sang and Xie Tianjiao immediately decided to bypass the hall and accelerate their advance.</p><p>Their figures, now two streaks of light, no longer concealed their speed. They were nearing the central hall, and if the chieftain was vigilant, he would surely notice their intrusion.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang felt a tremor in the golden page marking on his palm!  He rejoiced – they had found the right place! The celestial light had indeed pierced this location, leading to the Silent Space!</p><p>Their next task was to find a path to the Silent Space.  Qin Sang strained his heavenly eye, gazing below.  Through the thick red mist, he saw countless shadowy halls and palaces, submerged in a vast, crimson lake. The lake water was as vibrant as the poisonous mist, suggesting a toxicity far surpassing it.</p><p>Xie Tianjiao also sensed something, his movements momentarily halting. Then, both Qin Sang and Xie Tianjiao detected an unprecedented energy, utterly different from the Bi Xie Ancient Temple and the poisonous mist.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned his surroundings, spotting an island emerging from the lake near the submerged palaces.  It looked more like the corner of a mountain, also bearing structures, but with a completely different style from the Bi Xie Ancient Temple. The mountain seemed to have originally been submerged, colliding with the fallen Bi Xie Ancient Temple, causing immense upheaval and highly chaotic energies.</p><p></p>
