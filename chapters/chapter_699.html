<h1>Chapter 691: The Witchcraft Uprising</h1><p>Chapter 691: The Witchcraft Uprising</p><p>Qin Sang flew for several days without returning to Fuhu waters. Instead, he repeatedly changed course, venturing deep into the Demon Sea, intending to find a secluded place to hide.</p><p>However, along the way, Qin Sang encountered several cultivators returning from the Demon Sea, all hurrying along. This changed his plans.</p><p>…</p><p>A lush, uninhabited islet.</p><p>The island was covered in ancient trees, some so thick that it would take more than a dozen people to encircle them.  Unfortunately, the spiritual energy was meager; such a beautiful place was unsuitable for establishing a cultivation cave.</p><p>The tree shadows danced, the gentle tide lapping against the rocks.</p><p>On this otherwise peaceful island, several figures had appeared.</p><p>These people sat cross-legged around two others, holding spirit stones, in the midst of recuperation.</p><p>The two in the center were both Golden Core cultivators; the others were far weaker, only Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Around them was a temporary spirit gathering array constructed from spirit stones. Outside the spirit gathering array, more than a dozen earthen-yellow formation flags were planted.</p><p>The flags formed an illusionary array, seemingly quite powerful.  From outside, the area appeared as a patch of wasteland. Only someone getting very close and thoroughly searching would be able to detect anything unusual.</p><p>At this moment, the two in the center awoke from their meditative state. They glanced at their disciples recuperating around them, and instead of waking them, they communicated through voice transmission.</p><p>“To think the conflict between the two races has spread from the Inner Sea to the Demon Sea. The island master chose to remain neutral. We’d only been gone a few days when he decided to seal the island. I wish we hadn’t come out, what a waste of effort.”</p><p>One of them sighed, his tone filled with resentment.</p><p>The other questioned dubiously, “Senior Brother, do we need to rush back to Duoyan Island? Even if the two races have truly started an all-out war, it shouldn’t affect the Demon Sea’s situation so quickly. We’ve been preparing for so long, bringing our disciples out on this trip; hunting demonic beasts and returning shouldn’t be too late.”</p><p>“When Junior Brother Zhao rushed over to transmit the message, weren't you about to ask why I made such a swift decision to return?”</p><p>The one addressed as Senior Brother shook his head.  “Senior Brother is not worried about the conflict between the two races, but those who would fish in troubled waters. Previously, with the island master’s authority, no one dared to act recklessly. Now that the island master has suddenly announced the island’s closure, ignoring external matters, one can imagine the ensuing chaos. Both you and I are only early Golden Core cultivators, and we’re bringing so many disciples. If we don't return soon, things will become much more difficult later.  The conflict between the two races is unknown how long it will last. Legend says there was a war between the two races thousands of years ago, which lasted for several hundred years. What if we get trapped deep within the Demon Sea, exhaust our supplies, what then?”</p><p>The junior brother's expression changed slightly. “Senior Brother, you mean that the cultivators of the two races in the Demon Sea will also hunt each other?”</p><p>“Those who start trouble will eventually suffer the consequences?”</p><p>The senior brother sighed. “Without the instruction of Yuan Ying cultivators from both races, how could the Inner Sea erupt into such chaos? How could the cultivators of the Demon Sea truly be separated from the Inner Sea? If this turmoil cannot be quelled quickly, the cultivators of the Demon Sea will certainly be unable to stay out of it, especially now that the Demon Sea has already been affected. Besides the Witch Clan, human Cultivators will certainly seize the opportunity to kill and plunder, creating utter chaos. In such a situation, our only choice is to hide in Duoyan Island. With a Yuan Ying cultivator there, our chances of survival during the chaos will be significantly higher.”</p><p>Hearing his senior brother's explanation, the junior brother was convinced. “Senior brother's considerations are thorough, mine were far too simplistic…”</p><p>The senior brother hummed. “The last conflict between the two races was a long time ago, even our master didn’t experience it; it’s understandable that you wouldn’t know.  Alas! There’s a saying among mortals -  it’s better to be a dog in prosperous times than a human in troubled times.  Isn’t this the same for us cultivators?  We can only hope that this great turmoil will pass quickly…”</p><p>Just then, the senior brother sensed something and his expression changed abruptly. He stood up suddenly, raised his magical weapon towards the formation, and shouted, “Who’s there!”</p><p>The junior brother reacted immediately.</p><p>The two stood side by side, staring coldly at the outside of the array.</p><p>Their illusionary array had been discovered; someone had approached, and the two were furious.</p><p>“Two fellow Daoists, please calm yourselves, I have no ill intentions; I just want to ask a few questions…”</p><p>A gentle voice came from outside, and then a masked person appeared openly outside the illusionary array, spreading his hands in a gesture of goodwill.</p><p>This person was Qin Sang, in a different outfit. He had unintentionally discovered that there were only two early Golden Core cultivators among this group, and decided to inquire about information from them.</p><p>“Human cultivator?”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, and noticing that he was also only an early Golden Core cultivator, the two relaxed slightly, but remained highly vigilant; after all, there were many evil cultivators who kill and loot in the Demon Sea, and they are very good at disguise.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, what questions do you have? Why be so sneaky?” the senior brother coldly snorted, his tone unpleasant.</p><p>“If I hadn't done this, would you two have allowed me to approach? No need to look, it's truly only me.</p><p>"If I truly had malicious intent, would I have alerted you?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, his voice low and grave, "I'll trade a top-tier magical artifact for this information. I'll ask my questions and leave immediately, without disturbing you both. I've been cultivating in the Demon Sea for some time, intending to return to Duoyan Island for supplies.  I noticed something amiss, and seeing you two hurrying back… what exactly is happening?"</p><p>The two exchanged a look. The senior disciple hesitated before asking, "How many years have you been hunting demons in the Demon Sea, friend?"</p><p>"Seven or eight years," Qin Sang replied, slightly exaggerating.</p><p>"You've hunted demons alone in the Demon Sea for so long?" The senior disciple gasped softly, his eyes showing surprise.  "No wonder you're unaware.  Much has changed in the last two years, starting in the Inner Sea. Three years ago, the Witch Clan suddenly attacked without warning. We don't know the reason, but a great war has already been fought in the Inner Sea. We thought it wouldn't spread to the Demon Sea so quickly, but shortly after leaving the island, we received a message from our disciples. The island master has decided to seal the island off, ignoring what’s happening outside…"</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Qin Sang's face as he listened to their explanation.</p><p>The war between the two clans had actually begun!</p><p>Those who fled Pingbo Port were ridiculed for being cowards, but their caution saved their lives.  He wondered what had become of the human cultivators who remained.</p><p>The Witch Clan, previously weak, had suddenly attacked after the collective disappearance and return of their Yuan Ying stage cultivators. Had they obtained some treasure, giving them the confidence to challenge the humans?</p><p>It seemed he'd been wise to come to the Demon Sea early. Had he remained in the Inner Sea, he would have been caught in the chaos.</p><p>He didn't trust the Qiongyu Trading Company and had never told Ran Luo and the others his location.  The war had been raging for two years, yet he was only hearing about it now.</p><p>Qin Sang continued asking questions.</p><p>These were matters common knowledge on Duoyan Island, and the two had no reason to conceal anything, answering truthfully.</p>
