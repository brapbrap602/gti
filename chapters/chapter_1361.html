<h1>Chapter 1353:  The Great Change in Beichen</h1><p>The Demon Sea holds countless demon races;  Qin Sang has explored less than one percent of it.  </p><p>What most intrigued Qin Sang was the Four Sacred Palaces of the Canglang Sea.</p><p>The Four Sacred Palaces inherited the legacy of the Ascension Path.</p><p>Qin Sang, already a Yuan Ying cultivator,  could now look forward to the Ascension stage.  While whether he can break through to the mid-to-late Yuan Ying stage remains unknown, preparation is always wise.</p><p>During the Yitian Peak battle, Qin Sang forged a bond with a descendant of the Four Sacred Palaces and received a token.</p><p>He had planned to visit them after stabilizing the Ziwei Palace, but unforeseen circumstances arose. The prospect of finding the Canglang Sea amidst the endless storm is incredibly slim.</p><p>…</p><p>On the return journey,</p><p>all the Yuan Ying cultivators were burdened with worry.</p><p>Qin Sang,  True Person Changhong,  Feather King,  Lu Boyuan, and the Demon Lord Tongyou—the remaining top experts—met to discuss the situation before addressing the group.</p><p>“Regarding today’s events and the news about the Ascension Platform, it's best we all swear a Heart Demon Oath not to spread the word, lest it causes upheaval in the Three Realms and unrest in Beichen… What do you all think?”</p><p>True Person Changhong spoke.</p><p>The matter of ascension is of paramount importance.</p><p>Beichen and the Three Realms are separated by a storm barrier, maintaining a peaceful coexistence.</p><p>If news leaks out, the Yuan Ying cultivators of the North Sea's Three Realms would surely be unable to remain calm. They would undoubtedly come to Beichen to see for themselves.</p><p>At that time, with top experts ascending, Beichen would face the combined might of the Three Realms, potentially sparking a great calamity, putting them in extreme danger.</p><p>Fortunately, only Yuan Ying cultivators were present, making it relatively easy to contain the news.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators exchanged glances.  Each held significant power and influence; none wished to see Beichen plunged into chaos.</p><p>“True Person is right! If we spread the news of the Ascension Platform's destruction, others may not believe us and instead think we're concealing something, causing further trouble. It's best to keep it secret.”</p><p>A female Yuan Ying cultivator agreed.</p><p>The unrest in Beichen had only recently ended; people longed for peace, and she didn't want to be drawn into another war.</p><p>“However…”</p><p>An elder hesitated.  “The destruction of this Ascension Platform might mean there are others. Regardless, this was our only way out of the storm. If we ever get a chance to travel and seek help in the future, we can't be bound by a Heart Demon Oath, can we?”</p><p>His words echoed the sentiments of several others.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace was gone, but other hidden realms existed within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Even if none were found in Beichen, the other three realms, far larger than Beichen, surely contained numerous hidden realms and forbidden grounds.</p><p>“Elder Ye said that even with the Immortal Palace paving the way, one needs at least the strength of a Great Cultivator to survive the spatial storm and have a chance of escaping. Finding another Ascension Platform in the future will likely be incredibly difficult, perhaps even impossible—another Ziwei Palace is unlikely…”</p><p>The speaker, dressed as a Daoist, clicked his tongue, pausing before continuing, “We should focus on diligent cultivation. Otherwise, even if we encounter opportunities, we will only be bystanders, as we were today.”</p><p>The elder chuckled dryly.  “Friend Daoist suspects that one needs to reach the Ascension stage to ‘ascend’? At the Ascension stage, they can travel further in the storm zone than we can, perhaps even escaping directly, without taking such great risks.”</p><p>The Daoist shrugged.  “Who knows for sure? Optimally, at least late Yuan Ying is required. How many of us can achieve that?”</p><p>Silence fell among the group.</p><p>Among the Yuan Ying cultivators present, True Person Changhong and Feather King had the highest chances, but even they lacked confidence. They were very optimistic about Qin Sang, this rising star, but only Qin Sang understood his own difficulties.</p><p>“We may not be able to, but our descendants might. Once-in-a-millennium geniuses appear at least ten times in ten thousand years.  Their achievements might rival Elder Ye’s. When making the oath, we must consider our descendants, we can't truly keep it secret and cut off their hope…”</p><p>Someone spoke.</p><p>The implication was understood.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators showed signs of agreement.</p><p>This was precisely what Qin Sang and the others had discussed earlier.</p><p>“The various regions of Beichen will put aside their differences, disregarding the distinctions between righteous and demonic paths, and human and demon, to form the Beichen Alliance!”</p><p>…</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators reached a consensus, but the details required careful consideration.</p><p>Distribution of benefits was crucial.</p><p>As they discussed, they flew towards the nearest Hanging Skull Pass.</p><p>During their flight, however, they gradually sensed something amiss.</p><p>Usually, after the Ziwei Palace closed, the spiritual tide of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield would gradually subside, only experiencing occasional celestial phenomena until the next opening.</p><p>This time, however, there was an anomaly.</p><p>They were halfway there, and the spiritual tide, far from subsiding, was intensifying.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators noticed the abnormality, landed, and observed for a while, their expressions growing increasingly grave.</p><p>If this continued, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield would become like the overseas storm zone, a forbidden area for life! Even more terrifyingly, the barrier here wasn't flawless; it had seven gaps, precisely the Seven Xiong Passes!</p><p>These gaps appeared every few hundred years. In the past, the Small Cold Domain alone could withstand the spiritual tide's erosion.</p><p>If this continues, the Seven Heroes Pass won't hold for long.</p><p>Once a treasure land, it will become a shadow looming over the Northern Star Region!</p><p>"So that's it!  The Purple Micro Palace has been suppressing the spiritual tide, that's why the Ancient Immortal Battlefield is so unique and different from other places,"  said the Demon Lord Tongyou, his tone unusually grave.</p><p>The faces of the other Yuan Ying cultivators and demon kings from Little Cold Domain were equally grim.</p><p>The fall of the Seven Heroes Pass means Little Cold Domain and the Heavenly Demon Mound are the first to bear the brunt!</p><p>The impact of the Purple Micro Palace's ascension is far greater than they imagined.</p><p>"It seems the Northern Star Alliance is inevitable,"</p><p>Lu Boyuan sighed.</p><p>A calamity befalling one will soon affect another. The spiritual tide shows no mercy.</p><p>The Northern Star Desert is furthest from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and hasn't benefited much. Now that the Seven Heroes Pass is in crisis, they must still contribute to its defense—a truly frustrating situation.</p><p>"Let's go see the situation at Seven Heroes Pass…"</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators set off again.</p><p>As they neared the pass,  True Person Canghong suddenly received a message and his face became even darker than those from Little Cold Domain.</p><p>The message came from Immortaless Qiu Zhi.</p><p>She hadn't entered the Purple Micro Palace, but was guarding the gate with her people to prevent Ye Laomo from escaping.</p><p>True Person Canghong sighed and said, "The Sinful God Palace and the Outer Hall were both destroyed by the shockwaves from the palace's ascension.  The Abyssal Mire… was also affected! The celestial gate collapsed, the Abyssal Mire sank, and the bottom of the Heavenly Scar became an abyss in the blink of an eye, riddled with spatial rifts, turning it into a death trap! Thankfully, Daoist Qiu Zhi and the others were alert and evacuated in time, narrowly avoiding perishing there.”</p><p>"What!"</p><p>"The Abyssal Mire was destroyed too?"</p><p>…</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>This time, the Northern Star Region suffered tremendous losses.</p><p>The two most mysterious secret realms were destroyed one after another, and who knows what will become of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. While there are other secret realms and forbidden grounds elsewhere, they cannot compare in scale and the value of their treasures.</p><p>Finding opportunities for advancement has become even more difficult.</p><p>Xiang Qing suddenly cried out, "No! Wuyaya Valley!"</p><p>The Blood Lake in Wuyaya Valley's inner valley is connected to the Abyssal Mire, some even suspect it's part of it.</p><p>Since Qingyang Demon Sect's mountain gate is right next to Wuyaya Valley, Xiang Qing's anxiety is understandable.</p>
