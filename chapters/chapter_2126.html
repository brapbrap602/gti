<h1>Chapter 2116: The Thunder Seal Perfected</h1><p>Previously, Qin Sang had a constant feeling of impending doom. Now, with the completion of the Thunder Altar, a huge weight has been lifted from his heart.</p><p>His consciousness sank into the altar. A "page" formed of thunder, emitted a faint azure light.</p><p>This was another Thunder Oath Talisman, but due to the different refiner and the different thunder power borrowed, the emanations differed significantly.</p><p>Having incorporated the might of the Azure Luan True Thunder, Qin Sang couldn't gauge the exact power of this Thunder Oath Talisman, but it would undoubtedly be far stronger than the Moon渎 Bay Thunder Altar!</p><p>When Qin Sang's consciousness touched the altar, he felt a tremor, and thought with regret: This Thunder Oath Talisman is born from the Thunder Altar, created with the assistance of numerous cultivators. The altar formation acts like a "talisman base," the Oath Talisman must exist within it and cannot exist independently as a spiritual talisman, nor can it be carried around.</p><p>In other words, Qin Sang can only use this Thunder Oath Talisman in the Storm World.</p><p>Someday, he hopes to refine a true fourth-order thunder talisman without relying on the altar.  Then, even facing a Nascent Soul cultivator, he will have nothing to fear.</p><p>As for reaching the level of drawing a fourth-order thunder talisman in mid-air, even after breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang wouldn't dare to hope for it.</p><p>Besides refining the Oath Talisman, Qin Sang's personal gains were substantial.  It felt as if he had opened a new door, with various insights flooding in, pushing his understanding of talismanry to a whole new level.  Looking back at those third-order thunder talismans, they now seemed less complex and profound, including his third-order magic talisman, the Five Thunder Celestial Heart True Seal Talisman!</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang closed his eyes. The recently quieted thunder stirred again.</p><p>*Rumble…* Crack!  The sky flashed with thunder and lightning, the light brilliant.  In the center of the lightning, the shape of a thunder seal was faintly visible.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, seeming dissatisfied.  With a thought, the thunder seal dissipated, but the heavenly thunder became even more ferocious, silver serpents dancing wildly.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang raised an arm, pointing to the sky, slightly waving his hand.  Thunder capable of destroying all the peaks of the Qingyang Temple was now incredibly obedient, dancing to Qin Sang's movements.</p><p>The thunder gathered and dispersed, changing endlessly.  Each time it underwent several transformations, a thunder seal would re-form, only to dissipate again.</p><p>Countless thunder seals dispersed and reformed, each appearing identical—the Five Thunder Celestial Heart True Seal—indistinguishable from the next.</p><p>Only Qin Sang knew that with each reformation of the Five Thunder Celestial Heart True Seal, his understanding deepened.</p><p>In a short time, the progress was unimaginable!</p><p>Years ago, the Dao Court channeled the power of the Thunder Ancestor into his body, using him to cast the Five Thunder Celestial Heart True Seal Talisman.  Qin Sang had experienced its wonders firsthand. After breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, he hadn't spent much time on it, but his understanding far surpassed that of his peers, remaining one of his strongest combat techniques.</p><p>However, that was power bestowed upon him. Having only recently broken through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang still only understood the "how" of the talisman, not the "why."  He was still some distance from truly mastering it.</p><p>This construction of the Thunder Altar and the inscription of the fourth-order thunder talisman had filled this gap in his knowledge.</p><p>Being Daoist thunder talismans and thus of the same lineage, Qin Sang was able to use his previous accumulated knowledge, with everything coming together naturally and all his doubts resolved.</p><p>After countless thunder seals had formed and dissipated in the sky, Qin Sang finally stopped. He looked up, reaching out to grasp the air. The Five Thunder Celestial Heart True Seal trembled slightly and descended from the heavens.</p><p>A thunder seal, crackling with electricity, landed in Qin Sang's palm. It contained destructive power, incredibly violent, yet Qin Sang held it lightly, casually playing with it.</p><p>This alone demonstrated Qin Sang's profound understanding of the Five Thunder Celestial Heart True Seal Talisman.  While time was short, and he hadn't yet completely grasped all aspects of the talisman, he was confident that a short retreat would be enough to digest his gains and achieve mastery.</p><p>The Five Thunder Celestial Heart True Seal Talisman, bearing the High God's Heavenly Palace's legacy, a third-order magic talisman and a Five Thunder secret technique, should normally require at least the late Nascent Soul stage for mastery. Qin Sang achieved this at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, a feat rare even within the Dao Court.</p><p>This was one of Qin Sang's main reasons for constructing the Thunder Altar.</p><p>This is not the end. Qin Sang gazed at the thunder seal in his hand. His wings fluttered gently, wisps of azure light emanating from his phoenix wings, dancing among the feathers, flowing down his arm, and gradually merging into the seal, replacing the power of thunder within.</p><p>Gradually, the Five Thunder Celestial Heart Seal transformed into an azure thunder seal, resembling a jade carving.</p><p>At Yue Du Bay, Qin Sang could barely condense the seal using the Azure Luan True Thunder, but it was unstable, its power incomparable to what it is now.</p><p>Now, if Qin Sang were to face that powerful member of the Quan Feng tribe again, he wouldn't need to use his Dharma body and Dharma image together and employ the Sun Wheel Seal to break free from the other's heavenly might; this single seal would be enough to contend with them!</p><p>With more and more trump cards at his disposal, Qin Sang felt increasingly confident. With a gentle shake of his hand, the seal disappeared silently.</p><p>The celestial phenomenon vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang did not leave, remaining seated on the altar, continuing to inscribe talismans.</p><p>Before constructing the altar, he had considered that facing the relentless advance of the Si You army, he could not directly activate the Thunder Oath, and he needed other measures to maneuver and create opportunities.</p><p>The thunder altar built in the Storm Realm could also inscribe other third-order thunder talismans, which when activated through the altar, would still possess considerable power.  As long as he didn't inscribe another fourth-order talisman, he wouldn't have to worry about conflict with the Thunder Oath or exceeding the altar's capacity.</p><p>Inscribing third-order talismans was something Qin Sang could do himself using the altar, without needing assistance from others.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed himself completely, oblivious to the passage of time, until he completed all his plans before stopping.  All that remained was to meet the Si You army!</p><p>One day,</p><p>a message startled Qin Sang from his seclusion.</p><p>Inside the message was a crystal the size of a baby's fist, a spirit object capable of recording images.</p><p>Upon seeing the scene in the recording, Qin Sang left behind his Dharma body, rose and left the valley. Li Yu Fu, Shen Chen, and the others were already waiting outside.</p><p>“Master Uncle!”</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, everyone hurriedly paid their respects.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed them, seeing worry and apprehension on their faces, but no panic.</p><p>For years, Qin Sang had been like a whip, constantly pushing and pressuring the various tribes and sects of the Storm Realm to prepare for war, so this situation was expected.</p><p>“Go, proceed according to plan,” Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's composure, everyone's hearts settled, and they dispersed to their respective duties.</p><p>Qin Sang left Qing Yang Temple and went to the Western Lands to see Si Lu.</p><p>“Brother Qin!”</p><p>Si Lu rose to greet him, his expression grave. Qin Sang had already informed them of the situation through the altar.</p><p>At this moment, everyone in the Storm Realm was mobilized.  Armies from all directions were converging on the Western Lands.  All the branch altar masters had returned to their posts, ready for action.</p><p>“Brother Qin, have you found out who the Lu family has sent?”</p><p>Si Lu couldn't help but ask.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you'll see for yourself.”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang took out the crystal, infused it with true energy, and activated the recording, which showed the Si You army's arrival.</p><p>Upon seeing the first person to emerge from the teleportation hall, Si Lu said gravely, “This person is the Lu family's Grand Attendant!”</p><p>Qin Sang carefully observed. The crystal could only record external appearances; it showed the Grand Attendant's impressive bearing, but not much else.</p><p>“How much do you know about the Grand Attendant?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Most of our clan's strength lies in our companion beasts. The Grand Attendant has previously shown two companion beasts, both remarkably powerful, and their abilities match the descriptions in our records.  However, the other two are mysterious beasts not recorded in our clan's histories, their abilities virtually unknown, and we don’t know how he obtained them. During the great chaos, Xia Chang Shi said that we were fortunate to have escaped, otherwise we would have been intercepted by the Grand Attendant.  Otherwise, there would have been no hope of us escaping...”</p><p>Si Lu used sound transmission to quickly describe what he knew.</p><p>As he spoke, more and more Si You people emerged from the hall, and Si Lu continued, “This person is Lu Gan, Lu Wang’s chief general!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, “He was the one who fought me before!”</p><p>Shortly after Lu Gan appeared, a palanquin appeared in their sight.</p><p>“This is Lu Wang's throne, a treasure passed down through the Han Jiang Lu family. The person beside him must be the Shao Shi. I don't know much about this person.”</p><p>Although it was only a recording, seeing the enemy's overwhelming strength, Si Lu's expression tightened.</p><p>When the Yuan Xiang clan leader made his move and forced back the Si You people inside the hall, a gleam flashed in Si Lu's eyes, “These are all Han Jiang Lu family elites; there are no Imperial guards!”</p><p>“So, the Royal Family only sent a Shao Shi?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. This was undoubtedly good news, indicating that the Royal Family had not fully sided with the Han Jiang Lu family. Otherwise, with the Royal Family's resources, if they attacked with full force, even with the thunder altar backing him, he would still face a fierce battle.</p><p>As long as the Lu family could be severely damaged, the Royal Family's stance could be changed.</p><p>“The large army is approaching, soon to arrive.”</p><p>We should also prepare ourselves, clean up the courtyard..."</p><p>Qin Sang paused, gazing westward, and said softly, "Await the honored guests' arrival!"</p><p>...While the Storm Realm was busily preparing for war, the Siyou army was advancing from the east.</p><p>To avoid disturbing the tribes along the way, they took a roundabout route, traveling tens of thousands of miles, day and night, finally nearing the Changyou territory.</p><p>Changyou territory was surrounded by swirling mists, layered and complex in terrain. Many cultivators chose to explore and seek secrets here, but at this moment, there wasn't a single soul within tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>Shadows suddenly appeared on the sea, revealing ships following a palanquin, soaring through the air, unhidden, creating tumultuous waves, their momentum awe-inspiring.</p><p>'Boom!' Arriving before a mist, the palanquin stopped abruptly.</p><p>Inside the palanquin, Min Zhuo, the tribal leader, pointed ahead, "Your Majesty Lu Wang, beyond this mist lies our territory. Our warriors are poised and await your commands!"</p><p>When the army passed through the mist and arrived near Shengmu Plain, as Min Zhuo had said, countless flags were below.</p><p>The Changyou army had already assembled to await them.</p><p>Min Zhuo knew that since they were involved, the Changyou could not withdraw.  The tribe left behind some elite warriors and talented young people; the rest joined the battle, prepared for a decisive fight.</p><p>Both sides understood that the Changyou's strength alone wouldn't make much difference; victory wouldn't depend on them. But Min Zhuo's attitude pleased Lu Wang.</p><p>"I understand Min Zhuo's determination. Lu Gan, accompany Min Zhuo and select some skilled warriors to incorporate into our ranks.  Have the others follow, to bolster our presence," Lu Wang ordered.</p><p>Lu Gan and Min Zhuo received the order and left.</p><p>The incorporation was quickly completed.  The selected warriors were taken away by Lu Gan, leaving only two trusted aides with Min Zhuo.</p><p>Min Zhuo summoned one of them, setting up an isolation barrier, "Since I've been away, has there been any change in the Foul Lands?"</p><p>The person shook their head, "The foul energy shows no sign of receding."</p><p>Min Zhuo frowned, lost in thought.</p><p>"Tribal leader, don't worry," the person said cautiously, "With the Siyou army at our doorstep, those other tribes will be preoccupied with their own survival and won't be able to compete with us for the Qingling energy. This time, we should be able to get a rich harvest!"</p><p>"Short-sighted!"</p><p>Min Zhuo snorted, "Once the other tribes are destroyed, the Qingling energy will be exposed. Then, we will be competing with the Zhuyan and Siyou tribes. How much will they leave for us? Only by controlling the source of the Qingling energy can our tribe hope to gain more, ideally, to unearth the source and monopolize the opportunity!"</p><p>Then, Min Zhuo changed his tone, "Besides, how do you know those other tribes cannot resist the Siyou?"</p><p>Hearing this, the person showed a look of surprise, "Those other tribes only have two more Empty Realm Stage Two powerhouses. How can they resist the Siyou?"</p><p>"If it were that simple, why would Lu Wang lead the army himself and invite the Imperial Tutor to assist? Let's just wait and see!"</p><p>Min Zhuo turned and flew towards the palanquin, still pondering when the foul energy would recede.</p><p>He was determined to obtain the Daiyu Immortal Mountain, and his alliance with the tiger was for this very day. However, under the current circumstances, seizing Daiyu Mountain was akin to snatching chestnuts from the fire.</p><p>For him, the best scenario would be a stalemate, where the other tribes are not yet destroyed and too preoccupied to interfere, allowing him to slip away and secretly go to the Foul Lands.</p><p>If the other tribes are destroyed before the foul energy recedes, or if they defeat the Siyou army, his plans might fail.</p><p>The latter is almost impossible.  How to maintain the stalemate is a test for him.</p><p>Min Zhuo personally greeted the Siyou army to observe their attitude towards this war.  What he saw and heard along the way clearly indicated that Lu Wang was wary of those other tribes, even with two late-stage powerhouses by his side.</p><p>The strength of those other tribes was evident!</p><p>It can be deduced that Lu Wang wouldn't act rashly. He would first try to ascertain the strength of those other tribes and proceed cautiously.</p><p>This is where Min Zhuo can play a role; he knows those other tribes best, and Lu Wang will surely seek his opinion.  The information in the jade slip was carefully considered, and he will release more information to guide the course of the war as needed.</p><p>He could even fabricate information, and even if it is later proven false, it would be easy to explain.</p><p>Min Zhuo's mind raced, he let out a sigh of relief, his expression calm, and entered the palanquin.</p><p>Work finished late.</p>
