Chapter 157: Unexpected Developments

Boom!

A layer of the restriction was shattered with a loud thud.

Immediately, countless Fire Crows of all sizes flew into the pool. The water level in the pool dwindled rapidly until finally, the core restriction of the great formation was exposed to everyone.

The pool had run dry, and the deep pool became the entrance to a cavern. The large opening looked like a gaping black maw.

A layer of deep-blue light shielded the opening. It was not as deep as the pool, but it was still quite thick and completely obscured the opening. A few Fire Crows flew toward it, only to be instantly extinguished, unable to shake it in the slightest.

Endless runes flickered in and out of existence within the light shield and rotated slowly, creating an air of mystery. Although the pool was dry, the light shield continued to block everyone’s line of sight, obscuring the cavern beneath. Moreover, when they tried to probe the light shield with their Divine Consciousness, it would instantly bounce away.

After the core restriction was revealed, Qing Ting focused on the opening below, sending out a few wisps of Divine Consciousness to touch the light shield and unconsciously muttering something under her breath. Her expression was filled with tension.

After a while, the tension on Qing Ting’s face melted away. She said excitedly, “This restriction is about what I expected!”

Qin Sang and the others relaxed a little after hearing this.

Qin Sang gave an admiring look at Qing Ting. She was able to infer the rules of the entire great formation based solely on the restrictions in the levels above. This level of attainment was truly incredible. Among Foundation Establishment cultivators, there weren’t many who could compare to her.

“Fellow Daoists, pay close attention. We will begin to break the formation immediately, but everyone must listen to my orders. There can’t be any mistakes!”

Qing Ting spoke out a solemn warning, and everyone nodded. They quickly gathered their thoughts and focused all their efforts on controlling the Fire Crow Orders.

After carefully looking at the light shield, Qing Ting took a deep breath and pointed a finger at the Fire Crow Formation. Immediately, tens of thousands of Fire Crows screeched as they dove toward the pool. It looked like a rainstorm of Fire Crows, but in reality, these Fire Crows were less than one percent of the Fire Crow Formation.

Bang, bang, bang...

The Fire Crows grew faster and faster, like arrows shot from a bowstring. They fearlessly crashed into the blue light shield and shattered into pieces. But the flames continued to attack the light shield. The intense heat was like a stubborn maggot, burning fiercely on the light shield.

Qing Ting frowned slightly and summoned another group of Fire Crows to repeat the process.

At this moment, the light shield that had remained unmoving suddenly trembled slightly. The runes within the light shield began to spin rapidly, and the pale blue light grew stronger as the restrictions’ power surged out, instantly dispersing most of the flames.

Unfazed, Qing Ting activated the Fire Crow Formation again.

Group after group of flames flew down in an unyielding sacrifice. The runes within the light shield spun faster and faster. Qing Ting gradually began to control it intentionally, separately activating Fire Crows from various directions. Her eyes were fixed unblinkingly on the light shield, not missing a single change in the restrictions.

The runes within the restrictions changed endlessly, but they finally revealed a flaw. Several white dots suddenly flashed on the light shield. They disappeared in an instant, but Qing Ting had already noticed them. Her eyes lit up abruptly.

Immediately, Qin Sang heard Qing Ting’s anxious command to activate the Fire Crow Essence immediately and attack a point on the restriction.

Qin Sang did not dare to hesitate. His gaze flicked down as he fixed his sight on the point Qing Ting had indicated. He stirred his mind, and the Fire Crow Order in his hand began to glow. Countless flames surged toward the order, instantly transforming into a giant Fire Crow.

With a loud screech, the Fire Crow spread its wings and flew quickly, crashing heavily into the light shield.

At the same time, Yu Dai Yue and the others began to follow Qing Ting’s orders to activate their Fire Crows and strike the restriction. The light shield shook incessantly, but it still showed no signs of shattering.

“Keep going!”

Qing Ting shouted, and her commands grew more and more urgent. Qin Sang could only focus on controlling the Fire Crow Order, not daring to be distracted.

One Fire Crow Essence after another perished and was formed. The Fire Yuan Energy within the Fire Crow Order was rapidly depleted, but Qing Ting did not react. Her gaze remained fixed on the restrictions.

Crack!

A subtle yet clear sound echoed out like heavenly music.

Qin Sang’s spirits lifted, and he opened his eyes to look down. He saw a crack so fine that it was almost invisible suddenly appear at the edge of the previously seamless light shield.

"Finally broken open!"
Just when the crowd was excited, they found to their surprise that a dim black smudge appeared below the crack and spread rapidly through the crack, like a drop of ink quietly blooming, looking shockingly eye-catching amid the deep blue.
Everyone's joy turned stiff at this sight, and they all looked at each other in doubt.
"What are things black things?" Liu Jiang asked worriedly.
Baiyun Mountain Man said in a deep voice: "It seems to be a kind of fog, but it is blocked by the ban and cannot float out, and the naked eye cannot see it at all."
"Could it be demonic energy? Is there a big devil sealed inside?"
As soon as Wu Yuesheng said this, there was a moment of silence. Everyone looked at each other, their faces filled with surprise and worry, and no one spoke rashly.
Yu Daiyue coughed slightly and said with a wry smile: "Now that things have come to this, don't you want to give up? Isn't it a waste of time and energy for so many people?"
"Humph! You go, Li won't go. There are so many masters here, and they flee in panic without even seeing what is below because of a little black smoke. This will make me a laughing stock if it gets out. Li can't afford to lose this face!" Li Zai said coldly.
Qin Sang narrowed his eyes slightly, observing the others quietly.
Although everyone looked surprised, he was afraid that no one really wanted to leave. Since they had come this far, of course he would not give up, but these black qi didn't look like good luck. After breaking the ban, he might as well wait and see without rushing into it.
Qing Ting had been staring at where the crack was, seemingly not hearing everyone's arguments. Suddenly, he shouted anxiously: "Quick! Everyone attack the crack together and don't let it close!"
Everyone's expressions tightened before realizing that the light shield could also recover automatically. The crack was getting smaller and smaller, and they had no time to think about anything else. They hurriedly urged the Fire Raven Order.
'Boom! Boom!'
The light shield was bombarded continuously, and the entire canyon was shaking. The crack was getting bigger and bigger.
"Attack with all your might! Don't hold back!" Qing Ting shouted loudly.
Everyone's faces tightened, and the Fire Raven Formation suddenly whirled madly. A steady stream of fire element power was drawn from the seven Fire Raven Orders, and the color of the fire raven spirits inside grew dimmer.
'Crack!'
As soon as they kept attacking, several more cracks appeared beside the crack, some spreading toward the middle of the light shield and some spreading to the edges. The number of cracks increased, and it was only a matter of time before they could break the formation.
Just when Qing Ting asked them to draw all the fire element from the Fire Raven Order and spare no effort, a strange change suddenly happened!
Boom!
The light shield that had only cracked a few fine lines unexpectedly shattered by itself.
Caught off guard, everyone was stunned. They saw the fragments of the light shield falling into the deep cave at a startling speed, and then a great suction force suddenly came!
