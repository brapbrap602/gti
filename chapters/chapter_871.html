<h1>Chapter 863: The Blood Sword</h1><p>Chapter 863: The Blood Sword</p><p>The chilling air trapped the Kui dragon.</p><p>A young man surnamed Fang first flew into the air, disrupting the cloud formations to prevent the Kui dragon from using the power of heaven and earth's thunder to break the array. Legend has it that the Kui dragon can manipulate thunder, and no one dared to risk letting it unleash its innate divine ability, which could summon terrifying lightning.</p><p>Then, the young man flew back down to help suppress the Kui dragon's counterattack.</p><p>His back-and-forth efforts, combined with everyone's concerted effort to activate the array, stabilized the "Heavenly Cold Gale Array." The chilling air finally became steady.</p><p>As the stele continuously released its energy, more and more cold air converged above, forming white mist and a thickening pillar of frost, which from afar resembled a cage of black ice.</p><p>However, the Kui dragon's counterattack did not weaken in the slightest.</p><p>Its roars grew sharper, its claws slashing, its mouth spewing thunder, violently impacting the cage.  Each impact brought violent tremors and a dense network of cracks.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others, maintaining the array, felt their blood surge and their faces turn pale; their spiritual energy drained like a broken dam.</p><p>However, as the cage neared completion, the Kui dragon's destructive attacks lessened.</p><p>Seeing this, the young man surnamed Fang's face lit up. He stopped assisting, put away his golden rope, and transmitted a message: "Continue maintaining the formation.  You must not let the Kui dragon escape!"</p><p>Then, the young man swept his hand across his waist and drew a palm-sized short sword.</p><p>It looked like a short sword, but it was even smaller than a dagger.</p><p>The sword's hilt and blade were an eerie blood-red, and the blood grooves seemed to have fresh blood flowing in them.  As soon as it was drawn, a pungent smell of blood filled the air, staining the nearby frost red.</p><p>After drawing the blood sword, the young man's expression turned serious. He carefully held the hilt in one hand and sat cross-legged in the air.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were concentrating on manipulating the spirit array when they sensed something unusual after the young man drew the blood sword; they couldn't help but look over.</p><p>"What kind of cursed artifact is that?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered inwardly.</p><p>The blood energy on this blood sword was too intense, as if it had been soaked in a blood pool for countless years. It was undoubtedly a supremely evil object, definitely not a righteous artifact.  Even if it was forged with demonic blood, it must have absorbed the lives of countless demonic beasts.</p><p>Given the young man's cautious manner, the blood sword was probably not his innate treasure; neither was the golden rope he used earlier, making Qin Sang curious.</p><p>Normally, an innate treasure is a cultivator's most powerful artifact, one that resonates with the cultivator's will. Except for oddities like the Ebony Sword that require external objects to enhance their essence and carry killing talismans, innate treasures can be continuously refined as the cultivator's skill increases, gradually becoming more powerful.</p><p>Given the young man's cultivation level, his innate treasure would most likely be a mid-grade artifact. His abandonment of his innate treasure in favor of the blood sword suggested that either his innate treasure was damaged, or the blood sword was even more powerful.</p><p>The young man sat above the frost cage, holding the blood sword, his expression solemn; he muttered incantations silently.</p><p>As he chanted, the blood sword showed strange changes: it vibrated slightly, emitting a buzzing sound like the wails of vengeful spirits.</p><p>Even more intense blood energy poured out, and the blood sword slowly floated, hovering above the young man's head. The tip pointed obliquely at the Kui dragon in the cage, its blood-red blade emitting an extremely sharp light.</p><p>The Kui dragon sensed the blood sword's fluctuations; this sword made it feel threatened.</p><p>It stopped attacking, its huge eyes wide, staring fixedly at the blood sword.</p><p>At this moment, the Kui dragon's condition became clear.</p><p>Surrounded by the chilling air, its scales flickered with electric light, preventing the cold air from penetrating. After a period of intense fighting, it had been injured; some of its scales were cracked, and blood seeped out, forming whip-like marks.</p><p>Some were left by the young man's golden rope, and others were caused by the chilling air in the Heavenly Cold Gale Array.</p><p>The most obvious injury was its tail, where large patches of scales were broken and bleeding profusely. The Kui dragon had also been injured by its own impact against the cage.</p><p>However, these injuries were not fatal. To this behemoth, they were merely superficial wounds.</p><p>The Kui dragon remained vigorous and showed no signs of weakness.</p><p>It stretched its neck, glaring at the blood sword; sensing the threat, it opened its mouth to spit out thunder, but the now fully formed cage blocked it.</p><p>The fierce wind and cold intensified the effect of the spirit array.  Kui Long's attacks, imbued with intense yang energy, were normally unstoppable, but here they were being neutralized by the cold.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others channeled the cold energy, shielding the young man surnamed Fang, absorbing the brunt of Kui Long's assaults. They couldn't defeat Kui Long, but they could prevent it from breaking through the array and stopping Fang from completing his ritual with the blood sword.</p><p>All they needed was a little more time.</p><p>Fang, ignoring everything around him, focused intently on his incantations.</p><p>The blood energy surrounding the blood sword intensified, enveloping the blade itself, as if the malevolent weapon were growing stronger. The sword's aura grew increasingly menacing.</p><p>Frustrated by its inability to reach the young man, Kui Long coiled into a massive ball of lightning, a terrifying sphere of accumulating energy that grew larger and larger.</p><p>A bloodcurdling shriek emanated from within the ball, followed by a thunderous charge toward Fang.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others' faces fell.  They held nothing back, pouring all their energy into the crystalline stele.</p><p>The ground trembled; the stele itself began to waver.</p><p>Five visible streams of cold energy shot into the containment array.  After a flicker, the array collided with the lightning ball.</p><p>"BOOM!"</p><p>From afar, beneath the dark clouds, a pale white cloud appeared, rapidly expanding.</p><p>Kui Long was fighting for its life.  This was the crucial moment. Qin Sang and the others, their bodies shaking, gritted their teeth, pushing the array to its limits, gathering the cold energy.</p><p>The containment array held. Kui Long hadn't broken through.</p><p>But it didn’t stop. It recoiled slightly, then charged again. Just then, Fang was ready.  He lowered his head, glared at Kui Long, and roared, "Strike!"</p><p>The blood sword, now ten feet long, was one with the swirling blood energy.</p><p>The sword shot down, striking the lightning ball squarely. The cold energy of the array followed, further suppressing Kui Long.</p><p>A horrifying roar echoed through the heavens.</p><p>A burst of blood erupted from the lightning ball, then vanished – whether consumed by the sword’s power or vaporized by the lightning, it was unclear.</p><p>The lightning ball then began to dissipate and violently shake.</p><p>Hope surged through the group.  They watched intently as the thrashing form of Kui Long became visible.  It was bleeding profusely, the blood sword embedded in its abdomen. The blood energy on the sword seemed to writhe, seeping into Kui Long's body, inflicting terrible pain.</p><p>With Kui Long critically wounded, Fang showed relief, but a flicker of caution and vigilance remained in his eyes.</p>
