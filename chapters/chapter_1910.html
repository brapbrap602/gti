<h1>Chapter 1901 Fingerprints</h1><p>Qin Sang's consciousness entered his dantian, and he saw the fragments of the Disha Sword.  They were unchanged from a century ago.</p><p>A hundred years is but a blink of an eye for a sword spirit; the time it needs to recover is beyond human comprehension.</p><p>Sitting within the Lei Zu Altar concealed the Disha Sword's aura.</p><p>As the First Sword Servant said, even face-to-face, few in the world could discern its presence.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath.  The biggest threat was finally resolved.</p><p>Inspecting himself internally, during this time, as the Lei Zu phantom stabilized, his injuries had also mostly healed.</p><p>“It’s time to leave Yan Shui Temple. I need to find a place with abundant spiritual energy, open a cave dwelling, and continue my seclusion to solidify my foundation…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered his next plan.</p><p>He knew that although he had entered the Refining Void stage, he couldn’t compare to true Refining Void cultivators.  He was equivalent to someone who had just entered the late Divine Transformation stage and then directly ascended to Refining Void.</p><p>He had to first solidify his shaky foundation before continuing his cultivation.  If he rushed, future problems would inevitably arise.</p><p>Even though solidifying his foundation didn't demand extremely high levels of spiritual energy, Yan Shui Temple's training ground was no longer sufficient.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. His gaze fell upon the stone bed beside him, where he saw the Five Elements Crown spirit and Zhuque.</p><p>Zhuque could awaken at any moment.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown spirit, after being created by the sword spirit, had remained asleep. Qin Sang kept the spirit beside him, checking its condition from time to time.  He sensed that the demonic energy within the spirit was only suppressed, not significantly diminished over the century.</p><p>As for the Yunyou Sword in his primordial spirit, Qin Sang vaguely sensed a spirit embryo within the sword, breathing like an infant, gently rising and falling, but he didn't know when it would hatch.</p><p>Seven-colored霞光 suddenly appeared in the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, raising his palm. A Tianmu butterfly gently landed on his palm.</p><p>Bound by bloodline, Qin Sang perceived the butterfly’s somewhat urgent thoughts, pleading for something.</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked the butterfly's wings, softly saying, “You've eaten all the Yinghua Pills.  When I go out, I’ll find a great alchemist to refine more for you…”</p><p>In the Fuyao Realm, Qin Sang didn't have to worry about Yinghua Pills. Every time he returned from Jushan Zhizhi Altar, Master Lingxu would send them in advance, and Qin Sang only needed to provide some alchemic formulas.</p><p>He'd thought it was good luck, encountering such a generous person as Master Lingxu, but now he knew the truth.</p><p>Now the Yinghua Pills were completely depleted.  He focused on healing and stabilizing the Altar Guardian, and the Tianmu butterfly's cultivation had slowed considerably, remaining in the mid-fifth transformation stage.</p><p>If it were still in the Fuyao Realm, it would have already broken through to the late fifth transformation.</p><p>This was the downside of forcefully raising one's realm—treasures, divine abilities, spirit insects, and even physical strength cultivation were far behind, needing to be gradually improved.</p><p>“Asking other alchemists to refine pills…probably won’t be as easy as with Master Lingxu…”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t worried. He'd plundered a demon king's treasure trove, so his wealth was considerable.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang took out the Yaopeng's coral pearl, pouring out its contents before leisurely beginning to carefully assess them.</p><p>He couldn’t identify all the treasures, but he could roughly distinguish the spiritual materials, herbs, and other items.</p><p>Among them, Qin Sang also discovered spiritual treasures. One was the thunder mirror that Yaopeng had used to attack him.</p><p>Picking up the thunder mirror to examine it, Qin Sang shook his head.  As expected, this treasure lacked a Tongbao technique and didn't recognize him.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>Due to the limitations of the Tongbao technique, controlling spiritual treasures was extremely demanding.</p><p>In the several battles after reaching the Divine Transformation stage, Qin Sang increasingly felt that most of the spiritual treasures obtained by killing opponents were unusable, even though these were the most valuable spoils of war.</p><p>Those who could cultivate to this level were all cunning and resourceful, possessing numerous treasures.</p><p>If one only gained some spiritual materials, herbs, and strange treasures, the reward and risk were clearly disproportionate, a loss of effort.</p><p>Unless there was a deep-seated hatred or a huge stake involved, it was best to avoid a clash between two powerful beings.</p><p>Qin Sang found three spiritual treasures among Yaopeng’s belongings. The thunder mirror and another piece of red silk both lacked Tongbao techniques.</p><p>When he picked up the last spiritual treasure, Qin Sang's expression shifted.  This treasure actually had a Tongbao technique inscribed within it!</p><p>A pleasant surprise!</p><p>This treasure was pointed at both ends, gray and dull, shaped like a small boat. Qin Sang immediately understood why he had never seen Yaopeng use it.</p><p>It turned out to be a Earth Travel Boat, an earth-遁类 spiritual treasure.</p><p>For Qin Sang, its speed was far inferior to his thunder escape technique, but it could be exceptionally effective in certain environments, so he put it away.</p><p>Besides this, there were also many treasures needed for body tempering, things Qin Sang required.</p><p>As for Yaopeng's collection of cultivation techniques and demonic arts, they were all unsuitable for human cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang sorted his treasures, keeping the spiritual materials.  He then flicked his finger, and with a hum, the Gray Warbler Sword leapt from his storage ring.  Since the Cloud Wanderer Sword's restoration, this sword had been unused, but now it proved useful again.  Qin Sang had received the Killing Sword legacy from the Chengying Sword, had been personally tutored by the Transcendent Master Tianyue, and had dedicated many years to swordsmanship, so he had no intention of abandoning it.  He simply couldn't easily use the Seven Souls Killing Formation and the Cloud Wanderer Sword; other sword techniques were available.  In a way, swordsmanship held the greatest potential.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation and Master Tianyue's 'sword light' had opened the door to the Sword Domain for him, showing him a path: to evolve a sword domain from a sword formation!  If he could comprehend a true Sword Domain during the Refinement Void stage, it would drastically increase his strength.  Of course, while comprehending the Sword Domain, he should try to erase the shadow of the Seven Souls Killing Formation, ideally borrowing from it and then using other sword formations for deduction.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Seven Mansions Division Sword Formation, his currently most powerful and refined sword formation.  However, using only this formation to evolve a sword domain was a little thin.  His thoughts raced for a while before he snapped back to reality, looking at the Gray Warbler Sword.  Refining a spirit sword, using this sword as the base, and helping it advance to a spiritual treasure shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Then Qin Sang took something else from his storage ring.  In an instant, crimson light filled the cave.  It was the Sun God Tree; its shape was unchanged, but the sunbirds were gone from its branches.  The trunk still emanated the aura of the Vermilion Bird's true fire.  Qin Sang remembered that when refining the tree, he'd incorporated green bronze, mysterious white bronze, and the shell of a nine-lives Xuanwu turtle. Now, to his surprise, the turtle shell had completely fused with the white bronze; even the green bronze had almost been absorbed.  They'd lost their original form, indistinguishable from each other, and had fused with the Vermilion Bird's true fire.</p><p>"Is it because of the long-term tempering by the Vermilion Bird's true fire? Did I unintentionally refine something?"  Qin Sang was quite surprised; he might have refined an unprecedented spiritual material.  "Was the green bronze originally a fragment of a true treasure? Perhaps it could be used to refine something." He pondered, but lacking any immediate idea, he put it away.</p><p>As he sorted through everything, Qin Sang realized he had much to do.  "And…" Qin Sang's mind stirred, and Yin and Yang energies appeared on his forehead.  One black and one white stream of energy flew out from his brow; within the vortex, two chess pieces orbited each other.  The black piece had previously been sealed in a jade pendant. The Styx Ferryman had shattered the pendant, and it was now drawn to the white piece.</p><p>Qin Sang had tried to investigate the origin of the Yin-Yang chess pieces and the Ferryman's intentions, but to no avail.  "If there's a connection between the Styx Ferryman and the pieces, why didn't he keep the pieces or give me any guidance? Or were the pieces merely interesting to him, but not high enough in rank to be of use?"  Qin Sang was baffled and had made no progress in his investigation of the black and white pieces.</p><p>He had previously tried to use the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique* to comprehend them, but likely due to the technique's incompleteness, the pieces showed no significant reaction. He had placed them near his Yin-Yang armor within his Purple Mansion, but the armor showed no improvement, clearly indicating he hadn't found the right approach. He held them in his palm, feeling a cool sensation.  Comprehending these treasures wouldn't be a quick process.  Fortunately, after reaching Refinement Void, his lifespan was practically limitless; the Six-Nine Heavenly Tribulation came only every three thousand years; he had plenty of time.</p><p>The transformation from the Divine Transformation to the Refinement Void stage was earth-shattering, a true reversal of fate.  Despite being manipulated, Qin Sang had gained incredible benefits.  At least now, he held no ill will toward Master Tianyue or the First Sword Attendant.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang stood up, putting the Vermilion Bird in his sleeve before summoning his Five Elements Crown, sending a beam of five-colored light to its spirit to recall it to its main body.  He opened the door.  Outside, Gui Hou and Luo Hou, each occupying half the cave, appeared cramped.  Without Qin Sang's orders, they hadn't dared to leave.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"  Seeing Qin Sang, the two demonic cultivators immediately knelt and kowtowed.  They had originally called Qin Sang "Master," but somehow changed to "Master," a detail Qin Sang didn't mind.  Luo Hou still existed as a spirit, while Gui Hou had completely recovered and had even improved.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the two demons, saying, "You've guessed where we are, haven't you?"</p><p>The two demons exchanged a glance. Gui Hou's eyes widened, and he exclaimed excitedly, "Master, have you truly brought us to ascension?"</p><p>They had been sealed away during the Divine Court Uprising, unaware of the changes in the outside world.  The familiar aura of the Six Heavens was gone—something impossible before, even in the Great Sage's Estate.  Only one explanation remained: they had left that realm!</p><p>The legend of someone achieving enlightenment and bringing their family and animals to heaven—it had actually happened to them!  How could the two demons not be excited?  Free from the constraints of the Six Heavens' aura, their future held limitless possibilities; it was undoubtedly a tremendous blessing.</p><p>Moreover, the master they followed was no wicked being. If their fellow demons from Gui Fang knew, they'd be green with envy, the two demons thought happily.</p><p>"It's not exactly that, but it's close.  Newly arrived in the Great Thousand World, the path ahead is uncertain. I myself proceed with caution. You too should understand the importance of discretion. Following me, you will not be mistreated. However, some secrets are best forgotten," Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Both demons were intelligent and understood immediately. They knew they had no power to resist, so they readily submitted, saying, "We leave ourselves entirely to Master's disposition."</p><p>...</p><p>At dawn, Yan Shui Temple was teeming with worshippers.  No one noticed a particular worshipper who offered incense at the Sanqing Hall, stood gazing at the statue for a long time, then walked towards the back mountain.</p><p>He seemed quite familiar with the place. He went through the back door and strolled along the mountain path. The further he went, the quieter it became. Dew wet the stone steps; no one else had passed this way.</p><p>As he neared the back mountain, the man suddenly stopped.  A young Taoist priest quickly rounded a bend in the path. Seeing the man, he was startled and hastily bowed, "Greetings, sir. The back mountain is the private grounds of our temple's master.  We…"</p><p>Mid-sentence, the young priest noticed the man was also wearing a Taoist robe.</p><p>The man was Qin Sang. He glanced at the temple on the back mountain and smiled, "Please inform your master that I, a distant traveler, have come to pay my respects to the esteemed master of this temple."</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, the young priest's expression turned serious.  The back mountain temple was concealed by a formation; the fact that he could see it meant the other man was also a cultivator, and of a far higher realm than himself.</p><p>Shortly after Qin Sang was led into the temple, the quiet of Yu Guan Zhu's secluded courtyard was broken by hurried footsteps…</p><p>...</p><p>"I am Qingfeng.  I greet Yu Guan Zhu. I apologize for my unannounced visit and for disturbing your meditation," Qin Sang said, settling into a seat in the guest hall.  Seeing a refined young Taoist priest enter—one whose demeanor was surprisingly composed—he recognized him as the temple master and rose to bow.</p><p>"Since we are fellow practitioners, there's no need for such formality," Yu Guan Zhu replied warmly. He ordered someone to bring out his finest spiritual tea and chatted with Qin Sang for a while, before asking his purpose, "Master Qingfeng, may I ask from where you hail? Do you intend to stay at our temple? That would be easily arranged…"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, fabricating a backstory, "Please don't laugh, Master Yu, but I was poorly prepared and have become somewhat lost. I don't know exactly where this place is.  I came to visit fellow cultivators, to ask directions, and to seek out esteemed masters.  May I ask if there are any immortal cities or markets nearby where I might find such individuals?"</p><p>"Your courage is remarkable, to travel so far!" Yu Guan Zhu exclaimed, expressing his admiration. Qin Sang's aura was comparable to his own, yet he himself would never dare to travel so far alone, venturing into unfamiliar territories.</p><p>He then pointed south, "That is Lihu Lake. Yan Shui Temple is located within the Chen Kingdom. As you may have noticed, the surrounding areas are all mortal kingdoms.  There are markets and many cultivators, but it's difficult to find the kind of masters you seek…"</p><p>At this point, Yu Guan Zhu noticed Qin Sang dipping his finger in tea and drawing on the table, and he spoke more fully.</p><p>"To the north from here, some famous mountains and rivers may have Yuan Ying stage masters in seclusion. If you wish to find immortals and sages, you must travel eastward.  It is said there are immortal lands and great immortal sects there. I have long admired them, but have yet to make the journey, so I cannot guide you further. Also…"</p><p>Yu Guan Zhu paused, his voice suddenly grave. "If you should go west, be extremely cautious. If you see barren mountains, turn back!"</p><p>The Daoist sects of the Great Thousand World also called the Yuan Ying stage what they called it; Dao Ting’s terminology wasn’t even recognized by their own kind.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, rose and bowed, "Thank you for your hospitality, Master Yu. I will not trouble you further."</p><p>Yu Guan Zhu personally escorted Qin Sang out of the temple and watched him descend the mountain, relieved.  The man's origins were unknown; it was best to let him go peacefully. The cultivation world seemed rather uneasy lately. Was he truly just a wandering cultivator?</p><p>Lost in thought, Yu Guan Zhu passed through the guest hall, intending to return to his chambers, when he inadvertently glanced at the marks on the table, and froze, as if struck by lightning.</p><p>Those weren't water stains; it was a scene of misty rain, mountains and water blending, containing infinite mysteries.</p><p>An hour later, the temple disciples witnessed their master's unprecedented display of agitation.  Yu Guan Zhu, heedless of the surging true essence within him, rushed out of the temple, his face etched with urgency.  But the other man was gone.  He could only bow deeply towards the empty sky and shout, "Senior, I will never forget your enlightening grace!"</p>
