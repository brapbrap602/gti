<h1>Chapter 672: Anchor</h1><p>Chapter 672: Anchor</p><p>A multicolored halo enveloped the surroundings.</p><p>The only drawback was that it was too conspicuous, easily attracting unwanted attention and failing to achieve surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang trained the fat silkworm, instructing it to manipulate the size and shape of the multicolored halo.  After countless attempts and with all its might, the fat silkworm finally managed to shrink the halo slightly, making it appear somewhat denser.</p><p>"Not bad. Keep practicing.  It would be even better if you could eventually transform it into a protective armor,"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>The fat silkworm, exhausted after being worked so hard, lay panting in Qin Sang's palm, too afraid to complain, simply doing as it was told.</p><p>After all, the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire hovered above its head.</p><p>"Go rest. Don't slack off; I'll check your progress next time."</p><p>Qin Sang warned the fat silkworm, rewarding it with a strand of fiery gold.</p><p>Initially deeply resentful, the fat silkworm instantly forgot all its suffering upon seeing the fiery gold.  It eagerly lapped up the reward, looking up at Qin Sang with a fawning expression, seemingly vowing to work harder.</p><p>Compared to the fat silkworm, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly was simply exquisite, a sight that brought joy.</p><p>Nourished by its blood and generously fed various spirit fruits by Qin Sang, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's cultivation improved rapidly, poised for its second transformation in a few years.</p><p>After playing with the Sky-Eyed Butterfly for a while, Qin Sang routinely checked the restrictions on Ya Gu.</p><p>Ya Gu looked like a sleeping beauty, her expression serene as she lay quietly.</p><p>Seeing Ya Gu's state, Qin Sang sighed. He hadn't forgotten about removing the seal. While in Pingbo Port, he had tried to learn about the Canglang Sea's Corpse Ghost Dao techniques and gathered some information, but it was all rather underwhelming; the true inheritances of major sects weren't so easily obtained.</p><p>He wondered when he would find a way to awaken Ya Gu.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Ya Gu, letting out a soft exclamation.</p><p>He noticed something slightly different about her, but couldn't quite pinpoint it. Her appearance remained unchanged; nourished by the San Guang Jade Liquid's life force, her skin was rosy, showing no signs of corpse transformation.</p><p>"Could it be...?"</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang. He summoned the fat silkworm and indeed found a clue.</p><p>Sensing its master's presence, the previously listless silkworm suddenly perked up, jumping onto Ya Gu's palm and cuddling her fingertip like a kitten, exhibiting great affection and fondness.</p><p>Its affection for Ya Gu was genuine and unadulterated.</p><p>This was distinctly different from the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, which Qin Sang had forcefully subdued.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed a mysterious connection between Ya Gu's spirit and the transformed fat silkworm.  Perhaps it had always existed, but it was too subtle for him to detect before.</p><p>This connection imbued Ya Gu's spirit with a trace of vitality, as if the fat silkworm had become an anchor in the real world, allowing her to grasp a glimmer of light in the endless darkness.</p><p>This vitality, though minuscule, was strikingly clear amidst the stillness, incredibly precious.</p><p>This discovery filled Qin Sang with immense joy.</p><p>With the San Guang Jade Liquid, he didn't have to worry about Ya Gu's body deteriorating.  He had been concerned that if he couldn't awaken her in time, her consciousness would be completely lost.</p><p>Now, with the fat silkworm as an anchor and the warm jade's protection, Ya Gu could hold on longer.  It was clear that the stronger the fat silkworm's cultivation, the clearer the connection, and the longer Ya Gu could endure.</p><p>"It seems I need to find a way to awaken Ya Gu while simultaneously helping the fat silkworm transform—a two-pronged approach,"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, looking at the fat silkworm and Ya Gu.</p><p>Seeing the fat silkworm's helpfulness toward Ya Gu, Qin Sang's attitude towards it improved considerably.</p><p>...</p><p>The night passed without incident.</p><p>The next morning, Qin Sang awoke from meditation, opening the curtains and gazing towards the southeast.</p><p>A fine rain fell, and in the distance, a solitary peak emerged from the rain, standing tall under the heavens like a pillar supporting the sky!</p><p>This was Witch God Mountain, standing out among the other mountains with an air of unparalleled dominance, no wonder the Witch Clan revered it as a sacred mountain.</p><p>The tallest and most majestic mountain Qin Sang had ever seen was the Heavenly Mountain in Ziwei Palace.</p><p>But Witch God Mountain was in no way inferior, perhaps even surpassing it.</p><p>Heavenly Mountain was shrouded in countless terrifying immortal prohibitions, giving it an air of mystery and age.</p><p>Witch God Mountain, however, being revered as a sacred mountain by an entire race, was steeped in various myths and legends.  Some say that it connected the Azure Void above and the Nine Netherworld below, once the dwelling place of the Witch God, where their divine power was manifested.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze pierced the rain, fixed on the sky above Witch God Mountain.</p><p>The peak of Mount Wushan was shrouded in dark clouds, with raging lightning and streaks of silver light dancing across the sky.  Terrifying bolts of lightning flashed incessantly, creating a scene of apocalyptic punishment.</p><p>It was awe-inspiring, yet terrifying.</p><p>This phenomenon wasn't due to the current stormy weather.  Even with the sun blazing elsewhere, the dark clouds above Mount Wushan remained stubbornly fixed, the lightning never ceasing – a sight that had reportedly persisted for countless years.  Legends said it had been present since the mountain's earliest records, a truly mysterious occurrence.</p><p>"This Mount Wushan is no ordinary place," Qin Sang mused. "Even in the Canglang Sea, there are many mysterious locations rivaling the Purple Micro Palace.  The Seven Kill Hall, Mount Wushan... I wonder how many more places like these exist..."</p><p>He had witnessed the wonders within the Purple Micro Palace, yet felt little awe.  Others reacted differently.  The human cultivators visiting Mount Wushan for the first time showed unmistakable fear in their eyes.</p><p>"Master Qingfeng has awakened?  Perfect. Let's go ahead and fly to Mount Wushan together."</p><p>Distracted by the spectacle, Qin Sang heard Ran Luo's telepathic message.  Looking over, he saw Ran Luo, Ning Kun, and others dismounting their beast carriage and flying towards him.</p><p>"Not waiting for the caravan?"</p><p>Every moment counted.  Qin Sang was eager to reach the Demon Sea, so without hesitation, he packed away the arrays from the carriage and flew off.</p><p>"We've confirmed Mount Wushan is secure. Many cultivators couldn't wait any longer and decided to leave immediately. The caravan will send someone to bring the vehicles along slowly. We're very close to Mount Wushan now; no one would dare cause trouble here."</p><p>Ran Luo offered a brief explanation, nodded to Qin Sang, and continued forward, assigning tasks to her people.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around. The high-level cultivators, usually elusive, were now openly visible, flying towards Mount Wushan in small groups.  They belonged to various factions, but shared a common concern about the situation in Wushan Continent, prompting their departure from Pingbo Port.</p><p>Qin Sang only recognized Ning Kun and Huiwen amongst them. He decided to slow down and wait for Ran Luo with them.</p><p>Soon, Ran Luo caught up, accompanied by a man and a woman. The man was a refined middle-aged gentleman, Zou Lao, the chief steward of the Qiongyu Trading Company.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised by Zou Lao's youth. He sensed no pressure from a Yuan Ying master, indicating the man was likely a late-stage Golden Core cultivator.</p>
