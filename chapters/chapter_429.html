<h1>Chapter Four Hundred and Twenty-Two: Harmony Pill</h1><p>The fire chamber's restriction was triggered.</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts and looked up. "Come in."</p><p>A young man, only at the ninth level of Qi Refining, pushed the door open and entered, his expression respectful. "Greetings, Daoist."</p><p>"It's Zhong Ming."</p><p>Qin Sang recognized him, looked him up and down, and said warmly, "Not bad, not bad. It's been a few years, and you've already broken through to the ninth level of Qi Refining. You have a bright future ahead of you."</p><p>Zhong Ming repeatedly said he didn't dare. Seeing Qin Sang's willingness to chat, he was happy to engage in conversation. Qin Sang was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and any casual guidance from him could benefit him greatly.</p><p>"How is your inner fire seed?" Qin Sang asked casually.</p><p>Zhong Ming didn't suspect anything and extended his right hand. A cluster of Azure Yang Demonic Fire lit up at his fingertips. "It's relatively stable... There's no risk of self-immolation for now..."</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang released his divine sense, quietly probing the changes in Zhong Ming's cultivation technique.</p><p>Most of the information about the Azure Yang Demonic Sect came this way.</p><p>It was impossible to arrest Azure Yang Demonic Sect disciples openly in Azure Yang Market.</p><p>He wasn't in a hurry. He had enough patience to befriend the disciples of the Azure Yang Demonic Sect, gleaning the information he wanted bit by bit.</p><p>With his status as a Foundation Establishment cultivator and a renowned tool refiner, condescending to socialize with them, few could resist, and the questions he asked wouldn't harm the Azure Yang Demonic Sect, so he wasn't afraid of arousing their suspicion.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had a very good understanding of the Azure Yang Demonic Fire. After learning about the characteristics of the Azure Yang Demonic Fire and Azure Yang Divine Essence, he felt that the hope of stealing the Azure Yang Divine Essence was slim.</p><p>Azure Yang Demonic Sect disciples, cultivating Azure Yang Demonic Fire, could indeed come into contact with Azure Yang Divine Essence, but it was almost impossible to take the Azure Yang Divine Essence out of the Azure Yang Sect.</p><p>Azure Yang Divine Essence was, in essence, Azure Yang Divine罡.</p><p>This was a worldly wonder, Dry Heaven罡 Qi, even more dangerous than Earthly煞 Qi. Cultivators below the Golden Core stage had to be extremely cautious when approaching it and had no ability to take it away.</p><p>Of course, there were other ways.</p><p>For example, the Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle could contain Earthly煞 Qi.</p><p>After years of investigation, Qin Sang also found two special artifacts that could seal Dry Heaven罡 Qi, but they were difficult to refine, especially because the spiritual materials were hard to find. The main material was actually a precious spiritual material that could be used to refine magical treasures, and the difficulty of collecting it could be imagined.</p><p>Even if he could refine the artifact, it would be difficult to steal Azure Yang Divine Essence.</p><p>The Azure Yang Demonic Sect managed the Azure Yang Divine Essence very strictly.</p><p>The Azure Yang Divine Essence resided on Divine罡 Peak of the Azure Yang Demonic Sect. Divine罡 Peak was a forbidden area of the Azure Yang Demonic Sect, heavily restricted and guarded by elders.</p><p>Disciples could enter the mountain to borrow the罡 Qi to strengthen their fire seed, but no one was allowed to collect Azure Yang Divine Essence without authorization, not even Foundation Establishment disciples.</p><p>The Azure Yang Demonic Sect didn't have a Nascent Soul ancestor. There were four Golden Core masters in the sect, and one of them guarded Divine罡 Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to reverse the process and extract Azure Yang罡 Qi from the Azure Yang Demonic Fire.</p><p>It still didn't work.</p><p>After the Azure Yang Divine Essence was refined by the Demonic Fire, the characteristics of the Dry Heaven罡 Qi would disappear, becoming 'fuel' to strengthen the Demonic Fire. This process was irreversible.</p><p>Azure Yang Demonic Fire was very special.</p><p>Each disciple's fire seed was different. It was tailor-made by the Azure Yang Demonic Sect for each individual and integrated with the cultivator at the beginning of cultivation. Outsiders couldn't take it away.</p><p>People outside the Azure Yang Demonic Sect, even if they killed a disciple of the Azure Yang Demonic Sect and obtained the fire seed, couldn't subdue it. After a short time, the fire seed would dissipate on its own.</p><p>The only loophole was that Azure Yang Demonic Sect disciples could use the Demonic Fire to seal a trace of Dry Heaven罡 Qi.</p><p>The problem was that this trace of Dry Heaven罡 Qi was not only very small, but also existed for an extremely short time. It would dissipate before they could even leave the Azure Yang Demonic Sect.</p><p>...</p><p>Zhong Ming took out two items, a mid-grade spirit sword and a small stone.</p><p>The stone had dots of patterns on it, like stars in the night sky. Its body was pure silver-white, quite beautiful.</p><p>Its name also matched its appearance.</p><p>"Square Star Stone."</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the origin of the stone at a glance and looked at Zhong Ming in surprise.</p><p>Square Star Stone was a rare earth-type spiritual material. Adding Square Star Stone to a magical artifact, in addition to significantly improving the artifact itself, could release thousands of star lights after activation, dazzling the eyes and concealing the artifact's body.</p><p>It was especially practical in battles between low-level cultivators.</p><p>Square Star Stone was very rare, and its price was naturally high. Unless Zhong Ming was lucky and obtained it by chance, he would probably have to spend all his savings to buy this small piece of Square Star Stone.</p><p>Zhong Ming looked nervous. "Daoist, please take a look. Is this spirit sword compatible with the Square Star Stone? Can it be used to improve the spirit sword?"</p><p>Zhong Ming had bought the spirit sword from Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the spirit swords he refined like the back of his hand and said without hesitation, "Of course, it's just that it's not easy..."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang noticed that Zhong Ming looked a bit nervous and embarrassed. An idea came to him. "This piece of Square Star Stone will have some left over after refining the spirit sword. If you have no other use for it, it can be used as payment."</p><p>Zhong Ming was overjoyed and quickly agreed. "Thank you, Daoist."</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang was in secluded cultivation, refining tools in the Sky Spear Tower's fire chamber. Half a month later, he was interrupted by a transmission talisman.</p><p>Seeing the contents of the transmission talisman, Qin Sang's face lit up with joy. He hurriedly left the Sky Spear Tower and returned to the 'Sword Pavilion'. He saw Ning Youwei, over fifty years old, personally pouring tea and serving a young Daoist in the small shop.</p><p>The Daoist's face was familiar. It was Ming Yue's disciple, Li Yufu!</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang enter, Li Yufu hurriedly stood up and bowed. "Disciple greets Martial Uncle!"</p><p>"Rise!"</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed Ning Youwei and helped Li Yufu up with both hands, looking him over.</p><p>This was their first meeting since parting ways at Emerald Bright Mountain. Li Yufu's appearance hadn't changed much, but he looked more mature than when they first met at Emerald Bright Mountain.</p><p>His cultivation had already reached the Foundation Establishment stage!</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised at all. Li Yufu was originally very talented. Coupled with Yun Youzi's careful guidance, it would be strange if he didn't reach Foundation Establishment.</p><p>"Why are you still calling me Martial Uncle? Didn't Senior Yun Youzi take you as his disciple?"</p><p>Li Yufu scratched the back of his neck. "Grand Ancestor said that although immortals and mortals are different, mortal lineages should be respected and not easily discarded. Back then, Grand Ancestor personally visited Green Ram Temple, erected a monument and wrote a biography for Master and Grandmaster, and lectured on the Dao for a month, establishing Green Ram Temple's lineage, which also includes Martial Uncle's name..."</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in agreement. "That's good. Did your Grand Ancestor send you here?"</p><p>Li Yufu nodded and, remembering something, hurriedly took out a jade bottle from his storage bag.</p><p>Inside the jade bottle was a moon-white spirit pill, surrounded by swirling immortal energy, extremely mysterious.</p><p>"Martial Uncle, this is the Harmony Pill that Grand Ancestor asked for you. He asked me to bring it to you. Grand Ancestor..."</p><p>Li Yufu's voice suddenly lowered. He waved his hand and cast a soundproofing barrier before cautiously saying, "Grand Ancestor seems to have found information about a natural treasure and is currently incognito, personally verifying it..."</p>
