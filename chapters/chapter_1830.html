<h1>Chapter 1821: The Five Elements Crown</h1><p>Chaos!</p><p>Standing on the mountain peak, gazing at the scene beyond, everyone had the same thought. Even from this vantage point, the view remained obscured.  The Unseen Immortal Sect was shrouded in swirling mists, a sea of fog shimmering with a kaleidoscope of colors. The光芒 of restrictions and spirit arrays flickered erratically, while countless flying swords drifted through the void, creating a scene of utter disarray.  Straining their eyes, the group could only make out indistinct layers of mountain shadows. An air of profound mystery clung to the Unseen Immortal Sect.</p><p>The mountaintop had been flattened into a platform. Judging from the remaining traces, this was the original entrance to the Unseen Immortal Sect.  Several teleportation arrays were built upon the platform, presumably leading to different locations within the sect, all meticulously arranged.  A stone stele stood behind each teleportation array, bearing inscriptions. However, these teleportation arrays had long been destroyed from the other side, beyond repair. The steles, once protected by restrictions, now lay in fragments. The surviving inscriptions on the broken steles revealed characters like "valley," "hall," and "pavilion," but most were mere fragments, offering only vague clues to their purpose.</p><p>At the center of the platform, several teleportation array locations were clearly of greater significance.  One stele, fortunately intact, bore the inscription: "Earth Phase Hall!" Four other teleportation arrays, along with the Earth Phase Hall teleportation array, encircled another teleportation array.</p><p>Su Zinan pointed to these teleportation arrays. "According to what fellow Daoists have said, these should be the core of the Unseen Immortal Sect. This unnamed teleportation array, surrounded by the halls of the Five Phases, clearly holds a paramount position. Is it here that the Five Elements Crown, the supreme treasure of the Unseen Immortal Sect, is kept?" He spoke while casting inquiring glances at Zhu Wudao, the Strange-Faced Man, and the others.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man paid no heed.</p><p>Unwilling to antagonize Su Zinan at this point, Zhu Wudao replied while observing the Unseen Immortal Sect, "When the Unseen Immortal Sect met its tragic end, its heritage was scattered, and the Five Elements Crown vanished without a trace. No one knows where it ended up. It might still be hidden somewhere within these ruins, gathering dust, or it might have already been taken..."</p><p>"In that case, the Five Elements Crown is ownerless, belonging to whoever finds it. When the time comes, I trust none of you will claim it has 'always belonged to you' and cling to it relentlessly."  Su Zinan paused, and seeing Zhu Wudao nod, smiled with satisfaction.  "When my foster father recounted the secrets of the cultivation world to me, he never mentioned a single word about the Five Elements Crown. If not for your assurances, I truly wouldn't believe that the Unseen Immortal Sect's treasured artifact is such an obscure item."</p><p>"If it were widely known, how would I dare to summon the descendants of the Immortal Sect with the Five Elements Crown?"  Zhu Wudao, seemingly spotting what he sought, stared intently in one direction. "The Five Elements Crown is just one of the Unseen Immortal Sect's many treasured artifacts, the least known.  Back then, only the true inheritors of each lineage were aware of it..."</p><p>It turned out that the bizarre statue worshipped by the Gu God Sect, wearing a crown made of five crude jade pieces, was a representation of the Five Elements Crown.  Zhu Wudao, in spreading the Gu God Sect, used the image of the Five Elements Crown to rally the hidden descendants of the Unseen Immortal Sect.</p><p>While Zhu Wudao was busy observing, the others were also trying to decipher the various scenes within the Unseen Immortal Sect, guessing at the nature of the hidden grounds, but with little success.  The only certainty was that in the northeast, layers of immortal restrictions and overlapping peaks, even obscured by the chaotic scenery, exuded a distinct immortal aura. It must be a vital location within the Unseen Immortal Sect!  The Halls of the Five Phases were most likely in that direction.</p><p>Having found his target, Zhu Wudao took the lead, sweeping down the mountain.  Judging by his actions along the way, no one present could match his knowledge of the Unseen Immortal Sect. Everyone immediately followed Zhu Wudao down the mountain.</p><p>"Eh? The flight restriction has weakened."</p><p>Not far down the slope, Mo Xingdao was the first to notice the change.  Leaping upwards, he flew two zhang high before feeling pressure and the sensation of being locked onto by flying swords.  Everyone else experimented and found it to be true.</p><p>The Sword-Bearer gazed ahead, pondering, "The chaos of the Unseen Immortal Sect is not merely superficial.  The restrictions and spirit arrays here defy conventional understanding.  In some places, the restrictive force is weaker, allowing for higher flight, while in others, it's stronger."</p><p>"Indeed!" Zhu Wudao, without pausing or turning back, replied, "Everyone should remain cautious.  If any anomalies are triggered, they could affect other fellow Daoists."</p><p>Everyone heeded his advice, continuing their low-altitude flight.</p><p>Reaching the foot of the mountain, they found a vast expanse of desolate stone beach stretching as far as the eye could see. The beach was littered with rubble, devoid of vegetation.</p><p>Zhu Wudao flew into the stone beach and abruptly stopped, glancing down. He reached out and picked up a piece of off-white rubble.</p><p>This was no ordinary stone. It was clearly a fragment of a meticulously refined spirit material, yet it didn't resemble a fragment of a magical treasure.</p><p>The vast stone beach was covered in these fragments, countless in number.</p><p>Others also discovered the true nature of the stone beach.</p><p>At that moment, the fragments on the surface of the stone beach began to tremble slightly, and a rumbling sound emanated from beneath, like the pulse of the earth.</p><p>"What's that sound?"</p><p>Su Zinan's expression shifted slightly, a sense of foreboding washing over him. Although he was a descendant of a Soul Transformation cultivator, he dared not be careless within the Unseen Immortal Sect. This was no mere Soul Transformation realm, but a place filled with unknown dangers.</p><p>The tremors grew increasingly violent.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ground suddenly exploded.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a series of explosions erupted across the stone beach. Amidst the booming sounds, fragments flew everywhere, and grotesque shadows emerged from the ground.</p><p>Before these shadows appeared, Zhu Wudao and the others hadn't sensed any living presence.</p><p>The shadows, emerging from the stone beach without a sound and bearing no discernible aura, turned in unison towards Zhu Wudao and the others.</p><p>"War Formation Puppets!"</p><p>Zhu Wudao recognized the shadows, his expression darkening.</p><p>The shadows were puppets crafted by the Unseen Immortal Sect, shaped into various forms to achieve optimal coordination within a war formation. These were pure killing machines, born for battle, programmed to attack any intruders indiscriminately.  Although Zhu Wudao had inherited the legacy of the Unseen Immortal Sect, he couldn't control these ruins, and these war formation puppets wouldn't recognize him.</p><p>The puppets' eyes were vacant and lifeless.</p><p>Stared down by so many puppets, even these powerful cultivators felt a chill down their spines.</p><p>In the next instant, the sound of something tearing through the air filled the sky!</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The group felt a sudden darkness descend as the war formation puppets swarmed towards them, turning the sky above the stone beach into a sea of black. Their keen senses told them that these individual puppets weren't particularly strong, and many were missing limbs, broken and unable to form a complete formation.  They posed no threat to their lives.</p><p>However, the sheer number of puppets was overwhelming. Their companions were still behind, leaving them to fight alone.</p><p>"Charge!"</p><p>Without needing Zhu Wudao's reminder, everyone understood they had only one choice.</p><p>In an instant, Su Zinan and the others summoned their respective magical treasures and unleashed their divine abilities, charging into the stone beach, attempting to carve a path through the puppets.  Each of them was a peak expert, capable of obliterating a swathe of puppets with a wave of their hand, reducing them to fragments.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the puppets within the stone beach seemed endless, impossible to eradicate completely.  Moreover, they had lost their basis for cooperation, wary of each other, fighting individually, adding to the difficulty of dealing with the situation.</p><p>Su Zinan maintained a moderate pace, keeping his distance from everyone, including Mo Xingdao.  He raised his right hand slightly, five dragon tendons coiled around his fingertips, connected to a dragon tendon silk net. The silk net fluttered like a butterfly, enveloping groups of puppets. As the dragon tendons tightened, the puppets were crushed into fragments.  Su Zinan's face showed no sign of strain, his eyes flickering as he inconspicuously scanned the backs of Zhu Wudao and the others, lost in thought.</p><p>Suddenly, Su Zinan felt a shift, and abruptly looked up!</p><p>Above, the clouds churned, and at some point, points of light had appeared, flickering within the fog.  They had just witnessed this phenomenon – it was the sign of agitated flying swords, poised to attack!</p><p>Entering the stone beach hadn't only awakened the puppets but also triggered the flying sword formation.</p><p>Su Zinan cursed inwardly.  His fingers flicked rapidly, blood-red light shooting out, converging above his head to form a blood-red plaque. The plaque shattered with a *bang*, releasing a visible wave of blood-red energy that swept outwards.  Touched by the blood light, the puppets' joints seemed to rust, their movements slowing dramatically.  Su Zinan whipped his right hand, the dragon tendon silk net spreading above him, forming a protective barrier.</p><p>At the same time, a whistling sound filled the air.</p><p>Flying swords descended from the sky like a rain of arrows!</p><p>In an instant, everyone's figures vanished, swallowed by the ocean of flying swords and puppets.</p><p>Zhu Wudao, a golden mirror hovering above his head, endured the impact of the flying swords, his body bathed in golden light as he repelled the approaching puppets, steadfastly charging towards his chosen direction.  His target wasn't the northeast location everyone had identified as the heart of the Unseen Immortal Sect, but slightly deviated, towards the due north.</p><p>Since entering the stone beach, the Sword-Bearer had stayed close behind Zhu Wudao, repeatedly wielding his heavy sword.  He employed saber techniques with his sword.  His movements were strange, yet their power was undeniable, and they concealed his true identity.  The heavy sword, powerful and weighty, cleaved through the puppet hordes as if they were nothing.  As the flying swords descended, the Sword-Bearer remained calm amidst the chaos. His sword flashed around him, blade light flickering, enveloping him in a cage of blades as he locked onto Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Strange-Faced Man and the Weeping Spirit Cave Master had joined forces at some point.</p><p>A red flower floated above the Weeping Spirit Cave Master's head. This treasure emitted radiant light that repelled the puppets.  When its power turned inward, it could absorb flying swords, showcasing its incredible versatility.  However, the most at ease among them was the Strange-Faced Man.</p><p>He floated above the ground, perched upon a thick, serpentine vine.  Both ends of the vine were deeply embedded in the earth, carrying him forward as it undulated.  Whenever puppets approached, thinner vines would shoot out from the main vine, ensnaring them and dragging them into the ground.  When the flying swords fell, the Strange-Faced Man reacted similarly to Su Zinan, countless vines shooting upwards, weaving a protective net above his head.</p><p>Glancing at Zhu Wudao's position, the Strange-Faced Man transmitted his voice, "Cave Master, please keep a close watch on that old devil Zhu.  I'll go to the Wood Phase Hall first to retrieve a certain secret technique and then immediately rejoin you."</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master's expression showed displeasure.</p><p>Sensing the Weeping Spirit Cave Master's thoughts, the Strange-Faced Man offered further explanation. "That old devil Zhu hides a knife behind his smile. We must be wary of him tampering with the teleportation array leading to the Heavenly Harmony Hall, lest we fall into his trap. This secret technique is also essential, no less important than the Immortal Halls. Old devil Zhu is heading in a different direction than the Wood Phase Hall, so we must split up. I've already sworn a Heart Devil Oath and a Karmic Oath to you, Cave Master.  What more do you need to be assured? Old devil Zhu's disciples and followers haven't arrived yet. As long as you remain vigilant, there should be no problems."</p><p>Finally, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master heeded the Strange-Faced Man's suggestion and pursued Zhu Wudao alone.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man watched for a moment, then pushed off with his foot, the vine immediately changing direction and heading due east.</p><p>The White-Robed Man remained at the rear of the group.  Surrounded by puppets and flying swords, he was more cautious than the others, immediately slowing his pace. Water vapor billowed around him, forming a thick suit of armor made of water.  The armor appeared delicate.  *Thud, thud* sounds echoed continuously as the puppets and flying swords impacted the armor, unable to penetrate it, firmly protecting the White-Robed Man within. He advanced steadily, showing no intention of increasing his speed even after losing track of Zhu Wudao.  Eventually, he even stopped, waiting for a while before quietly moving away from the others.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was likely the least knowledgeable about the Unseen Immortal Sect among those present, having only recently begun gathering information about it. Su Zinan could at least glean some secrets from Old Devil Lu. His agreement with Su Zinan had ended after their exploration of the Unending Hall.  Their subsequent alliance under Zhu Wudao's invitation was temporary, and Su Zinan wouldn't share any secrets with him.  Apart from the Five Elements Crown, he was unaware of any other treasures within the Unseen Immortal Sect.</p><p>However, Mo Xingdao was certain of one thing: following Zhu Wudao was his best bet!</p><p>After a fierce charge, Zhu Wudao finally broke free from the stone beach.  Ahead lay a canyon, overgrown with wild grass, which didn't look any less dangerous.</p><p>Ignoring those following him, Zhu Wudao pressed on without hesitation, charging into the canyon.  The Sword-Bearer and the Weeping Spirit Cave Master followed shortly after.</p><p>As Mo Xingdao emerged from the stone beach, he was surprised to find that Su Zinan had vanished.  He hadn't followed, and his whereabouts were unknown.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Mo Xingdao decided to disregard Su Zinan and proceed alone.</p><p>...</p><p>Two figures flashed onto the mountaintop: True Person Purple Thunder and Yue Lingtian.</p><p>They looked down at the scene below.  The stone beach had transformed into a chaotic sea of puppets and flying swords, making it impossible to discern the others' movements.</p><p>While Yue Lingtian examined the stone steles, True Person Purple Thunder retrieved a jade talisman, holding it in his hand. After a brief moment of sensing, he said "Let's go," and flashed into the stone beach. Yue Lingtian followed closely behind.</p><p>Before leaving, Yue Lingtian glanced back, his brow furrowing slightly.  The Cloud Dragon had changed, and he wasn't sure if Hua Chenzi could still arrive in time.</p><p>…</p><p>Shortly after True Person Purple Thunder and Yue Lingtian entered the stone beach, Qin Sang ascended the mountain peak, echoing the sentiment of "chaos."</p><p>"Flight restrictions, flying sword formations, a sea of puppets…  It seems the attack on the Unseen Immortal Sect reached their very gates.  Perhaps they forcibly sealed the mountain gate during the war, causing these restrictions to fall dormant. Now, reactivated, they sense the presence of living beings and have awakened..."</p><p>Qin Sang analyzed the past events based on these clues.  The hasty sealing of the mountain gate by the Unseen Immortal Sect's ancestors suggested that many treasures within hadn't been moved in time.</p><p>Scanning the area, Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to descend, instead examining the inscriptions on the steles.</p><p>"Earth Phase Hall… some sort of teahouse…  Eh? Lang Huan Pavilion…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up.</p><p>Legend held that the Lang Huan Pavilion housed the complete collection of the Unseen Immortal Sect's scriptures.</p><p>The Unseen Immortal Sect wouldn't name things carelessly.  The so-called Lang Huan Pavilion must be the sect's scripture repository!</p>
