<h1>Chapter 1850: The Demon King</h1><p>White vapor drifted in the waves of light, like a wisp of smoke.  It pursued for a time, then hovered before transforming into Dingxiang Hou.</p><p>His long beard swayed. Dingxiang Hou stared ahead, his brow furrowed.</p><p>Only chaotic light and turbulent blue light remained in his vision; the enemy had vanished.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou wasn't skilled in flight techniques, but his cultivation was high.  Even after making a name for himself in Guifang, this was the first time he'd been outrun.</p><p>With the enemy's intentions unclear, Dingxiang Hou remained cautious, unwilling to reveal his full strength.  Still, the opponent's escape technique was clearly extraordinary.</p><p>He had intended to follow, waiting for Lingyou Wang, but a moment's lapse cost him the enemy's trail.</p><p>'Rustle rustle…'</p><p>His long beard stirred, each white hair suddenly dispersing, shooting out needle-thin wisps of white vapor like a chaotic dance of demons. They spread in all directions, forming a large white net to capture the lingering traces of his opponent's presence.</p><p>Unfortunately, the tremors hadn't fully subsided, and the energy signatures had been almost completely erased by the shockwave.</p><p>At that moment, a large shadow appeared behind Dingxiang Hou, spreading with terrifying speed.</p><p>From the shadows, a figure, feet on a black cloth, drifted close, appearing beside Dingxiang Hou as if taking a leisurely stroll.</p><p>"Lord," Dingxiang Hou, knowing who had arrived, turned and bowed.</p><p>"Lost him?"</p><p>Lingyou Wang asked indifferently.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou showed shame, "This person's cultivation is remarkable, his escape technique especially refined. I was no match for him."</p><p>"Oh?" Lingyou Wang's expression grew more serious.  "Was it one of the Grand Masters?"</p><p>Dingxiang Hou hesitated, "This person was strange, not like a human. I suspect he was a demon soldier under some Grand Master…"</p><p>Lingyou Wang's black eyes swept over the net of white vapor, his powerful spiritual sense spreading.  Unfortunately, the surroundings were too chaotic, greatly affecting his perception.</p><p>After hearing Dingxiang Hou's account, Lingyou Wang frowned, "Do you think that was the limit of his speed?"</p><p>Dingxiang Hou froze, immediately understanding Lingyou Wang's implication. His expression changed instantly, and he cried out.</p><p>"No good!  It was a feint!"</p><p>If the opponent truly had reserves, they likely intended to lure him and Lingyou Wang away.</p><p>The other Demon Lords were in danger!</p><p>The tremors were too violent, even Lingyou Wang couldn't afford to be distracted. In a place like this, setting a trap beforehand was almost impossible. Dingxiang Hou, encountering Qin Sang unexpectedly, had assumed another enemy and overlooked the possibility.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the white hairs from Dingxiang Hou's beard shot back, and the black cloth beneath Lingyou Wang's feet expanded, engulfing Dingxiang Hou and shooting back.</p><p>At this time, as the two demons had predicted, seeing Dingxiang Hou abandon the pursuit, Qin Sang immediately changed direction, making an arc to return to his original location, hoping for another chance.</p><p>He activated his Dharma image's wings.</p><p>Moreover, the Yunyou Sword circled him, its light merging with lightning.</p><p>Thunder escape, sword escape – Qin Sang's escape speed was already at its limit. He pierced through light and waves, swift as lightning!</p><p>Any Nascent Soul cultivator witnessing this would be astonished.</p><p>Having revealed himself, Qin Sang immediately decided to change tactics and show his fangs!</p><p>These demons arrived earlier; they might have discovered some secrets.  Capturing one would reveal the information, preventing the opponent from getting there first.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't confident against Dingxiang Hou, but not all Demon Lords possessed his strength.</p><p>Even if he couldn't find an opportunity to attack, Qin Sang could rely on his escape technique to easily get away – he was fearless!</p><p>'Rumble… rumble…'</p><p>The blue sea of light thundered ceaselessly from the seabed, deafening.</p><p>At this moment, two figures were dodging the waves of light. Two men, one tall, one short, both in long robes;  they were Demon Lords who had entered with Lingyou Wang. One was titled Ping Hou, the other Gui Hou.</p><p>Each of the Demon Lords had a black cloth imprint on their palm, left by Lingyou Wang.  It allowed them to sense each other within a certain range and quickly regroup after separation.</p><p>They scattered when the tremors began, and happened to be relatively close. Thus, they were the first to reunite, following the imprints to find the nearest Demon Lord.</p><p>Although the tremors were weakening, the two Demon Lords still had to dodge constantly, unable to be as relaxed as Qin Sang, Dingxiang Hou, and Lingyou Wang.</p><p>Ping Hou, a mid-stage Cave Xuan cultivator, was in slightly better shape, but had to protect the weaker Gui Hou.</p><p>"What sound is that?"</p><p>Ping Hou, as if sensing something, suddenly stopped and looked into the distance, a sense of unease creeping over him.</p><p>Gui Hou looked in the same direction, activating his demon eyes.  He saw only chaos. His pointed ears twitched, and his face changed instantly.</p><p>"Careful! There…"</p><p>Before he finished, they sensed a powerful aura rushing toward them at an incredibly astonishing speed.</p><p>Immediately, they saw a flash of lightning, brighter than a thunderbolt, sharper than a sword's gleam.</p><p>The two demon lords' eyes narrowed sharply, their vision stinging as if pierced by actual blades.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Trouble!</p><p>In an instant, the lightning tore through layers of light waves, faster than a thunderbolt.</p><p>The two demon lords were shaken to their core, their faces filled with terror.</p><p>The seabed trembled continuously.  Although they had been prepared, they were still caught off guard, experiencing a strange feeling of utter vulnerability.</p><p>It seemed that under this lightning, no magical power or treasure could save their lives.</p><p>They didn't flee.  The enemy's speed was astonishing; escape would only hasten their demise.</p><p>A desperate gamble was their only chance of survival!</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>Enraged, Ping Hou roared, his body contorting. Two sharp horns sprouted from his forehead, his body rapidly expanding, his limbs bulging with muscle, his bones twisting.</p><p>*Rip!*</p><p>His robe burst, revealing a powerful physique, his dark skin gleaming with an oily sheen.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Ping Hou had transformed into his demonic form, a massive black rhinoceros with one long and one short horn on its head. Between the horns was a silver mark shaped like a crescent moon—a Silver Moon Spirit Rhinoceros.</p><p>Simultaneously, Gui Hou also transformed, resembling a bizarre creature—part badger, part fox, part rabbit, part cat. This creature was known as a Gui Dog.</p><p>As their demonic forms materialized, the lightning arrived.</p><p>Ping Hou, being closer, saw the lightning heading straight for him.  The terrifying aura overwhelmed him, filling him with a desperate frenzy.  A sliver of madness flashed in his eyes as he fired a dazzling silver light from the horns on his head.</p><p>The silver moon mark between the horns shone brighter, separating from his head and rising slowly.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The silver light concentrated to its peak. The crescent moon transformed into a silver lightning bolt, hurtling towards the attacker.</p><p>The silver moon pierced the air with incredible power.</p><p>But the enemy showed no sign of stopping. The lightning's glow rippled slightly, and suddenly a sword image emerged, separating from the lightning, aiming directly at Ping Hou—then vanished.</p><p>Ping Hou's heart sank. A terrible premonition washed over him.  He felt a terrifying killing intent, his mind reeling.  Everything in his vision faded except for a single sword!</p><p>The sword was like autumn water, its spirit flowing.</p><p>A magnificent sword, but also one of slaughter.</p><p>Seven faint sword images merged into the main blade as Qin Sang instantly unleashed the Seven Souls Killing Formation, a terrifying aura targeting the silver moon and Ping Hou behind it, a single devastating strike!</p><p>"A spiritual treasure..."</p><p>From further back, Gui Hou's terror escalated into sheer panic. He feared not the spiritual treasure itself, but the sword strike it unleashed.</p><p>He had fought Daoist cultivators before, witnessed their talisman swords, but never had a sword been so breathtaking.</p><p>The killing intent was awe-inspiring; the sword intent was unparalleled.  This single strike embodied the guidance of a master swordsman, the principles of the *Metaphysical Sword Cultivation Chapter*, and Qin Sang's own profound understanding of the sword.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The silver moon dimmed, a prominent crack appearing in its center.  It had been cleaved in two.</p><p>The spiritual treasure shattered, but the sword intent still locked onto Ping Hou.</p><p>Ping Hou retreated wildly, his life force converging towards his chest.  His chest skin turned transparent, then into a round mirror, like a protective heart mirror.</p><p>The heart mirror, embedded within Ping Hou, was a defensive treasure, constantly absorbing his life essence. The mirror’s surface turned crimson, countless strange runes swirling within.</p><p>These runes then materialized before Ping Hou, forming a large treasure mirror.</p><p>The mirror was identical to the heart mirror, but much larger, completely shielding Ping Hou.</p><p>The mirror reflected the sword light and lightning.</p><p>Then ripples spread across the surface; the sword light and lightning within the mirror shattered, revealing the Cloud-Roaming Sword and Qin Sang.</p><p>At the same time, a faint crimson tinge stained the sword light before the mirror; the sword's momentum faltered.</p><p>Qin Sang felt an inexplicable binding force, trying to restrain him.</p><p>With a cold snort, Qin Sang's Pure Glass Treasure Light erupted, shattering the binding force. Before Ping Hou's astonished gaze, he stepped to the mirror and struck its surface with his palm.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The treasure mirror trembled violently, its surface rippling wildly, threatening to shatter.</p><p>Then, a spiritual light coalesced in his palm against the mirror’s surface, forming another sword.</p><p>The palm-sword pierced the mirror.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The magical mirror was actually pierced by the sword tip.</p><p>Ping Hou's eyes widened in fury.  A tearing sound echoed as his chest was ripped open, his protective amulet flying off. His only recourse was to use the amulet's true form.</p><p>At that moment, a golden light shot from behind Ping Hou, containing a dozen golden needles.</p><p>These needles, launched by Gui Hou, were incredibly sharp, their energies interconnected and mutually reinforcing, making them extremely powerful.</p><p>‘Bang bang bang…’</p><p>The needles struck Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't even try to dodge, standing his ground, every needle finding its mark.</p><p>But what shocked the two demon lords was that the needles were all stopped by Qin Sang's armor, failing to inflict any harm.</p><p>In fact, the armor was layered with a divine light.</p><p>Gui Hou's cultivation was inferior even to a Sky-Eyed Butterfly; breaking through the divine light was difficult, let alone penetrating the Ming Shan Armor.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang didn't even glance at Gui Hou, his palm forcefully pressing forward, the palm-sword piercing the mirror as he lunged for the amulet's true form.</p><p>The Yun You sword followed closely, its boundless killing intent assaulting Ping Hou's mind.</p><p>It seemed Qin Sang was determined to defeat Ping Hou.</p><p>But just as Qin Sang was about to collide with the amulet, his hand suddenly stopped. His figure vanished from Ping Hou's sight like a ghost.</p><p>Ping Hou froze, immediately understanding, and roared, "Watch out!"</p><p>The warning was too late. Qin Sang had successfully bypassed Ping Hou and appeared before Gui Hou.</p><p>The Yun You sword, however, remained locked onto Ping Hou, preventing him from reacting.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang's target had always been Gui Hou; otherwise, that previous strike wouldn't have merely shattered the Silver Moon!</p><p>Indeed, that strike wasn't even the peak of Qin Sang's swordsmanship.</p><p>Though it incorporated seven sword spirits, they weren't from the Yun You sword, but from the shadow of the Cheng Ying sword!</p><p>Cheng Ying, Cheng Ying.  When Qin Sang comprehended his inheritance, the Cheng Ying sword was refined into a shadow of the Yun You sword.</p><p>Initially, the shadow's power was less than half that of the Yun You sword; now it was approaching sixty percent.</p><p>The seven-spirit killing formation was actually executed by the Yun You sword's shadow, combined with the Yun You sword's own power, making the strike comparable to any magical treasure.  No one would doubt its full power.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang had deliberately held back.</p><p>The shadow was formless, allowing for surprise attacks, but it could also be used differently.</p><p>When the true Yun You sword emerged, it would give the enemy a great surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang’s actions weren't to deceive the two demons; dealing with them didn't require such elaborate schemes.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Gui Hou felt a blur before his eyes.  The enemy, who had just been fighting Ping Hou, suddenly appeared, closing in on him, filling him with terror.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s shining armor, unharmed by the golden needles, only deepened his fear.</p><p>‘Wooo…’</p><p>Gui Hou let out a strange roar, his fur standing on end, as countless points of golden light appeared.</p><p>Each hair transformed into a golden needle, aimed at Qin Sang in a furious barrage.</p><p>Countless needles rained down, a continuous stream of golden light, with a particularly bright point at the center, like a golden chisel, targeting Qin Sang's throat.</p><p>The next moment, Gui Hou saw a scene that filled him with despair.</p><p>The golden chisel struck its target, yet it felt like hitting an unyielding wall.  His opponent simply swayed slightly, completely unharmed!</p><p>The attack was indeed extraordinary, a skill Gui Hou had cultivated for years.  Ordinary people wouldn't dare to receive it head-on.</p><p>Unfortunately, he encountered the Ming Shan Armor.  The fragment of the true treasure could divide and reunite, blocking the golden chisel effortlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang, covered in needles, his gaze cold, broke through the needle formation and lunged at Gui Hou.</p><p>…</p><p>“Presumptuous!”</p><p>“How dare you!”</p><p>As Qin Sang closed in on Gui Hou, two roars echoed from afar, from Ling You Wang and Ding Xiang Hou, who had arrived too late.</p><p>Qin Sang had used his escape technique without reservation, making considerable noise, alerting Ling You Wang and Ding Xiang Hou.</p><p>Ling You Wang’s black cloth disappeared, transforming into black, ethereal waves propelling them forward at incredible speed.  Yet they were still too late, the situation having deteriorated drastically.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the pursuers were coming. He was wary of these two, especially one demon cultivator who filled him with inexplicable unease, whose power was unfathomable.</p><p>Knowing he couldn't defeat Ping Hou before the reinforcements arrived, Qin Sang had set a trap, unexpectedly targeting Gui Hou.</p><p>He didn't look back. His relatively small figure seemed like a death god to Gui Hou.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang…’</p><p>All the treasures and techniques Gui Hou frantically unleashed were easily received by Qin Sang, to no effect.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>His forearm was broken.</p><p>Despair set in, but the shouts of Ling You Wang and Ding Xiang Hou rekindled a glimmer of hope in his eyes.</p><p>“My Lord, save me!” Gui Hou croaked.</p><p>My Lord!</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was shocked, his expression changing drastically.</p><p>At that moment, he finally understood.  There were no hidden masters. Those mysterious strong figures he feared were actually demon kings and grand masters!</p><p></p>
