<h1>Chapter 431 Misdirected Anger</h1><p>‘Clang…’</p><p>The token rolled on the ground for a moment, then suddenly vanished.</p><p>A cold, feminine chuckle echoed through the hall. “Hmph… That old ghost Fang and Shentu, those two geezers wouldn't rest until they dragged me into this mess.  I can't even find peace hiding here…”</p><p>In the next instant, a figure materialized before everyone.</p><p>The figure was tall and slender, appearing to be a young man of only twenty years or so. His exceptionally handsome face bore a dazzling smile, yet it carried a tinge of gloom.</p><p>The token had somehow found its way into his hand.</p><p>No one had detected any fluctuations of spiritual power.  They were startled by his sudden appearance, realizing with a jolt of fear that this must be the Core Formation cultivator named Pei Qin!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Pei Qin extended a hand, seizing the unconscious Liu by the throat.  A multicolored, strange light emanated from his palm and flowed into Liu’s body.</p><p>A groan followed.</p><p>Liu regained consciousness, but his face was contorted in agony.</p><p>Pei Qin gripped Liu's jaw, forcing his eyes open.</p><p>Their gazes met, and Liu suddenly became unresponsive, his pain seemingly intensified, his entire body convulsing.</p><p>A strange light flickered in Pei Qin's eyes as he used some peculiar method to interrogate Liu.</p><p>A moment later, Liu lapsed back into unconsciousness.</p><p>Pei Qin snorted and tossed Liu to the guards. His figure shimmered, on the verge of disappearing, but then he abruptly paused, turning to survey everyone in the hall with a sinister smile.</p><p>“Little Cold Region is in trouble. All cultivators have a duty to defend it. Disciples of the Eight Righteous Sects, follow me to the south of the Broken Islands, two hundred miles out, to meet the enemy. The rest of you are free to go, head north.  But don't get any funny ideas; I've memorized your faces. If I don't see you on the battlefield, and I find out you've run, I'll personally visit those sanctimonious old geezers in your sects and see if they’ll uphold righteousness by punishing their own! Heh heh…”</p><p>His voice still reverberated in the hall, but Pei Qin had vanished.</p><p>Silence descended upon the hall.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure dashed towards the stone chambers, followed by a series of whooshing sounds as cultivators not belonging to the Eight Righteous Sects scrambled for the exit.</p><p>Only a few people remained, frozen in place, exchanging uneasy glances.</p><p>As the others left, their gazes lingered on the remaining group—looks of pity, mockery, and schadenfreude.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened.</p><p>The exit was so close, yet his legs felt like lead.</p><p>In that final moment, Qin Sang felt Pei Qin's gaze pierce his mask. It wasn't a high-quality artifact and couldn't block a Core Formation cultivator’s divine sense.  Qin Sang hadn't expected to incur the wrath of a Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>Now that Pei Qin had seen his true face, there was no room for maneuver.</p><p>Even Qi Yuanhu wouldn't be able to protect him if Pei Qin followed through on his threat.</p><p>Finally, only they remained in the hall. The guards bowed slightly. "Fellow Daoists, this trade fair has concluded. Please feel free to leave."</p><p>Then they strode away.</p><p>There had been surprisingly few disciples from the Eight Righteous Sects at this trade fair.  Including Qin Sang, there were only nine.  Qin Sang hadn't found any fellow disciples from Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Fortunately, the disciples from the Eight Righteous Sects were certainly not weak.  Of the nine, three were late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>“I am Cang Ling of the Pure Yang Sect. May I ask for your names, fellow Daoists?”</p><p>Qin Sang saw one of the late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators turn towards him. He knew further concealment was pointless.</p><p>He removed his mask and said, “Shaohua Mountain, Qin Sang!”</p><p>“Yuanchen Sect, Fan Zhen!”</p><p>Another late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator removed his hood, not even glancing at Qin Sang, speaking coldly.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Ever since Senior Qing Zhu had attacked the Yuanchen Sect, killing two Golden Core cultivators, Shaohua Mountain and Yuanchen Sect had nearly become sworn enemies.  In the end, both sides had exercised restraint, avoiding war, but their relationship had plummeted to freezing point.</p><p>Disciples of the two sects held mutual animosity.</p><p>Qin Sang had been at the Skull Hanging Pass and then at the Green Sun Market, rarely encountering Yuanchen Sect cultivators.  Now it seemed that the rumors were indeed true.</p><p>Given Fan Zhen’s attitude, Qin Sang wouldn't bother being friendly. Ignoring Fan Zhen, he bowed to Cang Ling. “Fellow Daoist Cang, with the highest cultivation among us, you must have a plan.  Please share it, and I will follow your lead.”</p><p>Cang Ling gave a wry smile. "That senior took out his anger on us and wouldn't disclose any information about the situation ahead. We're going in blind. I can’t think of a good plan, but we can’t stay here. If we're late and miss the battle, he’ll find another reason to blame us.  If none of you want to disobey his order, we should head out and discuss a strategy on the way..."</p><p>Cang Ling's words intensified the resentment among the others.</p><p>Someone gritted their teeth, “Judging by his actions, he’s most likely from the Demonic Sects!”</p><p>“That senior wasn't entirely wrong. Little Cold Region is in danger, and we cultivators have a duty… heh heh…”</p><p>An old man let out a dry laugh.  Seeing no one respond, his face became embarrassed.</p><p>Did he even believe his own words?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways at the old man and said, “Be careful what you say! Fellow Daoist Cang is right. Regardless, we must go. Let’s move…”</p><p>Qin Sang and Cang Ling took the lead, flying out of the hall, followed by the others.</p><p>The Vast Azure Lake stretched out, water meeting sky, dotted with countless islands.</p><p>Fish swam below, birds soared above. All was peaceful.</p><p>There was no sign of any fighting.</p><p>“There's no need to be discouraged. Since it’s not a full-scale attack, the Heavenly Mandate Alliance villains might not be that strong.  And Senior Fang and the others surely wouldn’t rely solely on us for reinforcements. Senior Fang and the others will handle the Core Formation cultivators.  We can look for opportunities.  If we can turn the tables and kill some Heavenly Mandate Alliance villains, we’ll achieve great merit. If the situation is unfavorable, we’ll fight and retreat, looking for a chance to escape.  Then we'll have an excuse when questioned by our sects.  What do you think…?”</p><p>They formed a simple battle formation, concealing their auras as they flew south.</p><p>Cang Ling's words were exactly what Qin Sang wanted to hear.  Judging by the expressions of the others, they were also agreeable to the plan.</p><p>Qin Sang prepared himself, gazing into the distance, pondering.  He least wanted to join forces with others.  He couldn't use his treasures freely when working with others, severely limiting his strength.</p><p>But if his life was threatened, he wouldn't hesitate to prioritize survival.</p><p>But where could he flee to in this vast world?</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed his thoughts.  Seeing that the Broken Islands area was vast and it would take time to reach the battlefield, he took advantage of the lull to transmit his voice to Cang Ling, "Fellow Daoist Cang, do you by any chance know a Fellow Daoist Han from your sect? He was the former head of the Han Clan and a good friend of mine.  It’s been years, and I wonder how he is doing…”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin is referring to Senior Brother Han? Of course, I know him!”</p><p>Cang Ling laughed heartily, speaking with a hint of envy, “Senior Brother Han possesses excellent talent and has encountered enviable opportunities. He was taken as a closed-door disciple by an Elder and is being personally instructed in secluded cultivation. It is said that he is about to reach peak cultivation and is preparing for Core Formation… Next time Fellow Daoist Qin sees Senior Brother Han, he might already be a Golden Core Master!”</p>
