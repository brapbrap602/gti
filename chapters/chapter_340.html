<h1>Chapter 333: The Truth</h1><p>Chapter 333: The Truth</p><p>Mud bubbles gurgle up from the swamp.</p><p>Mist rolls in, shadows dance among the trees.</p><p>Tan Hao travels west, his pace unhurried, his escape technique unimpressive for his apparent cultivation level.  The masked man and Qin Sang follow with ease.</p><p>The masked man is patient. After leaving the stone island, he doesn't immediately attack, silently trailing Tan Hao deep into the uninhabited swamp.</p><p>Or perhaps he's cautious.</p><p>The masked man is also at the early Foundation Establishment stage, his aura stronger than Tan Hao's.  It's a situation of planned versus unplanned action, but even a lion hunting a rabbit must exert itself fully. It's best to strike only when success is guaranteed.</p><p>One strike, one kill.</p><p>He's waiting for Tan Hao to let his guard down.</p><p>Tan Hao isn't completely unaware. He's laid down some hidden restrictions during his flight, but the masked man and Qin Sang easily detect and avoid them.</p><p>The night is silent, the swamp even darker.</p><p>After a quarter of an hour.</p><p>The masked man follows into a grove of trees, then suddenly stops. He's lost Tan Hao's trail.</p><p>The ancient trees in this grove aren't dense, the surrounding space is open. A moment ago, Tan Hao's aura was steady and straight, then he vanished without warning.</p><p>The masked man releases his spiritual sense to search, finding nothing.</p><p>The night wind picks up, everything seems normal.</p><p>Tan Hao has vanished into thin air, completely and without a trace.</p><p>Not far behind, Qin Sang is concealed in a treetop, also observing.</p><p>Due to the distance, Qin Sang didn't see how Tan Hao disappeared. Like the masked man, she can't tell if he's hidden somewhere or used some other method to evade them and escape.</p><p>"I underestimated Tan Hao..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowns, pondering for a moment before revealing herself, waiting patiently.</p><p>The masked man surely has more up his sleeve.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected, the masked man's search is fruitless, but he shows no anxiety, instead sneering faintly and producing a round, mirror-like artifact.</p><p>He brings his two fingers together, spiritual energy surging as he quickly draws on the mirror.</p><p>Strange runes flow into the mirror, which begins to glow, the light growing increasingly bright, like a full moon.</p><p>However, the masked man skillfully conceals this light, not letting a single ray escape.</p><p>With his final stroke.</p><p>The masked man shouts, "Rise!"</p><p>The mirror flies from his hand, soaring into the night sky, transforming into a moon among the stars. The surrounding mist is dispersed by the 'moonlight'.</p><p>The clear light spreads, instantly illuminating the surroundings as bright as day.</p><p>The next moment, the man sharply turns his head to the left, seeing between two ancient trees, a barely visible shadow slowly moving â€“ Tan Hao.</p><p>Tan Hao, using some unknown method, has hidden himself perfectly, slowly escaping.</p><p>He's just at the edge of the 'moonlight'. If the masked man were even a little slower, he would have escaped.  But there are no ifs.</p><p>Tan Hao had prepared a contingency plan, but he hadn't expected someone to be following him, someone who could easily break through his defenses.</p><p>Suddenly revealed by the mirror's light, Tan Hao's heart leaps, his back prickling with fear. He knows that whoever followed him here and discovered him so easily must be far stronger.</p><p>Without looking back, not knowing who he's provoked, Tan Hao transforms into an escaping light, fleeing with all his might.</p><p>He knows the chances of escape are almost zero, but even a sliver of possibility is worth fighting for.</p><p>Watching Tan Hao's fleeing light, the masked man doesn't immediately pursue. His eyes flash with surprise and mocking anger; he's almost amused.</p><p>"Damn it, he's a Qi Condensation cultivator!" the masked man curses.</p><p>The masked man's anger is understandable. Qin Sang is equally surprised. Tan Hao's true cultivation, revealed by his escape technique, is only at the thirteenth level of Qi Condensation.</p><p>If they had known Tan Hao was only a Qi Condensation cultivator, the masked man could have easily captured him on the stone island. Why the painstaking pursuit?</p><p>The strange mask is what helped disguise Tan Hao's cultivation.</p><p>Even Qin Sang was deceived by Tan Hao.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen artifacts or spells that could conceal one's aura, such as the *Dun Ling Jue*, but this was the first time she'd encountered one that masked its user's cultivation so perfectly.</p><p>The mask was truly extraordinary.  Even at mid-Foundation Establishment stage, Qin Sang hadn't detected anything unusual.</p><p>She wondered if the late-Foundation Establishment experts had noticed anything. However, since Tan Hao dared to participate in the auction and the secret market, he must have been confident in the mask's abilities.</p><p>It certainly wouldn't fool a Core Formation cultivator, but a Core Formation cultivator wouldn't lower themselves to cause trouble for someone like Tan Hao.</p><p>This disguise was easily seen through and didn't actually increase Tan Hao's strength.  As it was now, once Tan Hao engaged in combat, his true cultivation would be exposed.</p><p>But on Stone Island, the rules of Yin Mountain Pass kept cultivators in check; they rarely fought, and Tan Hao wouldn't start trouble, so his disguise had held up until now.</p><p>Unable to sustain the mask, his face was revealed to Qin Sang.</p><p>It was indeed Tan Hao!</p><p>Compared to his time at Kui Yin Sect, he looked much older and more mature.</p><p>Qin Sang was seventy, and Tan Hao was only a few years younger, yet he appeared to be around forty, looking even older than Qin Sang.</p><p>This was normal for cultivators. If Tan Hao hadn't reached Foundation Establishment, his aging would have accelerated over the past twenty years, turning him into an old man with white hair.</p><p>But Tan Hao, being over sixty and still not at Foundation Establishment, had very little hope of achieving it.</p><p>Despite the changes, Tan Hao's features hadn't altered much from his time at Kui Yin Sect, allowing Qin Sang to recognize him immediately.</p><p>His former spiritedness was gone, replaced by a weariness etched onto his face and a fatigue evident in his eyes, causing Qin Sang to sigh.</p><p>The path of immortality pursued by cultivators was so ethereal; they, too, struggled for survival in this world, just like everyone else.</p><p>The masked man cursed a few times, then leisurely waited for Tan Hao to get some distance before calmly giving chase.  To him, Tan Hao's possessions were already as good as his.</p><p>Behind him, Qin Sang followed silently, secretly summoning her ebony sword.  She'd initially intended to let the masked man probe Tan Hao's abilities, but that was no longer necessary.  Given their skills, Tan Hao wouldn't last more than a few exchanges before being killed.</p>
