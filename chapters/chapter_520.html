<h1>Chapter Five Hundred and Thirteen: Refining Oneself</h1><p>Suddenly issuing such a command, there must be a reason.</p><p>Combined with the auction at Skygloom Pass half a month later, it can be concluded that the Green Sun Demonic Sect's leader is not currently at the sect!</p><p>Such an opportunity must not be missed.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this was a golden opportunity and couldn't wait any longer. He immediately decided to activate the next phase of his plan.</p><p>At this time, Wanderer Yun was already inside Boundless Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly left Green Sun Market and arrived at a desolate mountain.</p><p>This desolate mountain was one he had chosen long ago. A cave had been carved into the mountain, furnished with restrictions and a spirit-gathering formation, making it a superb secluded cultivation spot.</p><p>He entered the cave and sealed the restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang placed spirit stones into the spirit-gathering formation. Once the spiritual energy within the cave became abundant, he took a deep breath and opened his mustard sack.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh...*</p><p>The Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle, the five elemental Yin objects, and the Heavenly Corpse Talisman flew out of the mustard sack one after another, instantly scattering before Qin Sang.</p><p>Having already made up his mind, he naturally wouldn't hesitate any longer.</p><p>With a flick of his finger, he took a Heavenly Corpse Talisman into his palm, looked down at it, and after confirming it was correct, he slapped it against his forehead, controlling the talisman to enter his nascent soul space.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's will, the Jade Buddha didn't reject the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, allowing it to enter Qin Sang's nascent soul.</p><p>History repeated itself, and Qin Sang was clearly much more proficient than before.</p><p>However, the last time he faced a life-or-death crisis and had no choice, this time it was for a sliver of possibility, to attempt a path to Core Formation, doing it of his own volition.</p><p>Qin Sang actively accepted the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, without any resistance or rejection, so he easily completed the first step of refining a living corpse. What followed, however, was unprecedented.</p><p>Perhaps even those demonic cultivators from the Corpse Refining Demonic Sect wouldn't be crazy enough to refine themselves into living corpses, right?</p><p>Qin Sang raised his arm and looked down.</p><p>With the Heavenly Corpse Talisman inside him, under the influence of the restriction, his physical body had already begun to change. His skin was faintly pale, and his blood vessels showed a light blue tinge, though not obvious on the surface.</p><p>But Qin Sang himself could feel it; this was the sign of corpse Qi gradually emerging.</p><p>Instinctively, a bloodthirsty desire surfaced in his heart, but the corpse transformation had just begun and wasn't severe. Even without the Jade Buddha's protection, it was easy to suppress.</p><p>Pressing his pale skin, Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and looked at the five elemental Yin objects on the ground.</p><p>The *Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter* itself had no attribute. Qin Sang, following the *Netherworld Scripture*, had always cultivated primarily with water-type spiritual energy. He immediately pointed at the Yin Spirit Water.</p><p>He was more than familiar with the corpse refining restriction. He opened the bottle cap, extracted a mass of Yin Spirit Water, held it in his palm, and slowly refined it.</p><p>[Reading Benefits] Follow the official account [Book Friends Base Camp] to draw cash/coins every day!</p><p>Soon the refinement was complete. Qin Sang pondered for a moment, wrapped the Yin Spirit Water with spiritual energy, and slowly guided it toward his dantian.</p><p>The moment the Yin Spirit Water touched his body, a chilling sensation spread.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly, but his movements weren't affected. He sent the Yin Spirit Water into his dantian and immediately began to carve corpse refining restrictions on his body, cooperating with the Yin Spirit Water to stabilize his Qi Sea.</p><p>The five elements mutually generated each other.</p><p>Next came the Moon Locust Wood Core, the Ghost Carving Plume, the Nine-Aperture Stone, and finally the Blue Nether Gold.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's own control, the spiritual energy within his Qi Sea was very docile. The step of building the foundation with the five elements was also completed smoothly without any setbacks.</p><p>Now, only the step of drawing Earthly Yin Qi into his body remained.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the remaining five elemental Yin objects, leaving only a large pile of Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottles on the ground.</p><p>Logically, this step of drawing Earthly Yin Qi into the body was best performed in an Earthly Yin Cave. If the Earthly Yin Qi was consumed significantly, it could be replenished at any time.</p><p>But the Earthly Yin Cave was too far from here, and Qin Sang didn't have that much time.</p><p>Wu Shang had personally experienced it. After drawing Earthly Yin Qi into the body, the Earthly Yin Qi would uncontrollably begin to assault the physical body, and the speed of corpse transformation was astonishing.</p><p>If he refined himself into a living corpse in the Earthly Yin Cave, by the time Qin Sang trekked to Green Sun Market, his physical body would have completely lost its vitality, beyond recovery.</p><p>Fortunately, according to Wu Shang's experience, refining oneself was different from refining others.</p><p>Refining others required control through a soul imprint. Separated by a layer, the sensing speed, reaction speed, and control would all be affected.</p><p>Refining oneself was different. He could effectively restrain his internal spiritual energy's rejection of the Earthly Yin Qi. He could respond to any changes immediately, greatly increasing the probability of successfully drawing the Earthly Yin Qi in and wasting much less of it.</p><p>It was the same principle when later enhancing the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>However, this step presented a new difficulty.</p><p>Earthly Yin Qi entering the body caused a terrifying impact on the Qi Sea. This impact would bring unbearable pain, and as the refinement progressed, the deepening corpse transformation would increasingly affect the mind.</p><p>The combination of the two made maintaining a stable state of mind during the refining process extremely difficult, requiring immense willpower.</p><p>An unstable state of mind, if a mistake occurred, would ruin all previous efforts.</p><p>Back then, Wu Shang prepared some healing and mind-stabilizing pills, but he didn't expect the transformation to be so violent. He relied on a determined Dao Heart, risking it all, and ultimately succeeded.</p><p>Qin Sang certainly wasn't afraid of corpse transformation contamination, but whether he could endure the pain of his Qi Sea's turmoil depended on his own willpower.</p><p>There wasn't a trace of fear on his face. He swallowed a few healing spirit pills and then hooked a Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The magnetic bottle opened.</p><p>A wisp of Earthly Yin Qi escaped.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, sensed his Qi Sea, and after confirming there were no omissions, he guided a wisp of Earthly Yin Qi, tentatively drawing it into his Qi Sea.</p><p>*Hiss...*</p><p>A coldness countless times more intense than the Yin Spirit Water made Qin Sang's body tremble slightly. He immediately stabilized his mind and body, focusing all his attention on the changes in that wisp of Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Within his Qi Sea, a storm erupted.</p><p>The Earthly Yin Qi submerged into his Qi Sea, and even Qin Sang's own spiritual energy couldn't restrain it for a moment, completely losing control.</p><p>His Qi Sea became chaotic, the two energies clashing.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't immediately draw the Earthly Yin Qi out as he had done before because he could clearly perceive every change in his body. He hadn't lost control yet.</p><p>The conflict intensified, and Qin Sang felt like he was falling into an icy abyss, his whole body frozen stiff, while his Qi Sea was like a boiling pot.</p><p>Fortunately, the barrier formed by the five elemental Yin objects made Qin Sang's dantian extremely sturdy, and it wouldn't be destroyed in a short time.</p><p>Qin Sang persisted for three breaths before expelling that wisp of Earthly Yin Qi. While waiting for his Qi Sea to recover, he carefully recalled the process, gaining much insight.</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>Qin Sang drew out another wisp of Earthly Yin Qi, but this time, based on the experience he had just gained, he made some adjustments, proceeding slowly and cautiously.</p><p>The second attempt also failed, but he gained new experience.</p><p>He tried again.</p><p>Although he failed repeatedly, his progress was clearly much faster than when refining living corpses before, and the expression on Qin Sang's face became increasingly relaxed.</p><p>Finally, after only exhausting one Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle, Qin Sang successfully incorporated a wisp of Earthly Yin Qi into his Qi Sea!</p>
