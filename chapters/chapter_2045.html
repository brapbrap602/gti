<h1>Chapter 2036: The Back View</h1><p>Chapter 1608: The Back View</p><p>Ghost Mother was surprised by Qin Sang's answer.</p><p>"She hasn't chosen the wrong person... Why not ask her what she thinks? Or, you can bring me other members of the Wu tribe, the previous conditions still apply."</p><p>Qin Sang said regretfully, "The teleportation array is in Ziwei Palace, we can't go back."</p><p>Ziwei Palace ascended, the path is cut off, unless there is a sea chart leading to the Canglang Sea in a Nascent Soul relic.</p><p>"The materials for the array have already been prepared, using a few drops of her essence blood as a guide, it won't hurt her. I won't hide it from you, during the crossing, she will also have to carry my soul body."</p><p>Ghost Mother explained the 'return' process to Qin Sang, solemnly saying: "I have a premonition, my physical body is hidden in the place of return, this is one of the reasons why I must return! You don't need to doubt me, the divine silkworm has voluntarily submitted, the bond between them is so deep, it can even reach the point of symbiosis, it's something no one can take away. Moreover, it only has a trace of divine silkworm bloodline, its future potential is still uncertain, it may not surpass my spiritual insects. If you are still worried that I will harm her, I can make a heart demon oath and a karmic oath. As long as I am still alive, I will never let her be harmed!"</p><p>Because of the jade Buddha, Qin Sang was always a little distrustful of the heart demon oath.</p><p>After arriving in Central State, Qin Sang learned more about karmic oaths.</p><p>Karmic oaths are very binding, no one wants to bear the consequences of breaking an oath, the drawback is that the process of making an oath is very cumbersome, and in most cases it is inapplicable.</p><p>In any case, waking up Ya Gu must be done with Ghost Mother's help.</p><p>So Qin Sang didn't object and decided to wake Ya Gu first.</p><p>"What needs to be prepared?" Qin Sang cautiously asked.</p><p>"For now, we can only forcibly guide her consciousness, using the divine silkworm to barely respond to us, rashly waking her up will have great drawbacks. Although she and her life-bound insect Gu are one, there must be a master-servant distinction. She has been asleep for too long, the process of waking her up must be gradual, otherwise she will be dominated by her life-bound insect Gu. Even in the Wu tribe, there are those who become insect slaves."</p><p>Ghost Mother gestured for Qin Sang to help Ya Gu up, maintaining a cross-legged posture, while she herself busied herself in the cave, setting up layers of restrictions to prevent being disturbed.</p><p>Waking Ya Gu must be done in the quietest environment.</p><p>Qin Sang stood guard, closely watching Ghost Mother cast spells.</p><p>Ghost Mother understood Qin Sang's thoughts, she didn't hide any of her actions from him, and would even actively explain the meaning of every move.</p><p>Refining the Heavenly Corpse Talisman is simple, but the removal process is very complicated.</p><p>She tapped with her jade fingers, thousands of complex runes flew out from her fingertips like flowing water, gathering into a river of blue and white light in the cave.</p><p>The river of light flowed around Ya Gu, its head and tail connected, forming a halo, finally slowly descending, enclosing Ya Gu and the stone bed in the center.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know much about Wu magic, but based on his experience, he guessed it was some kind of forbidden array.</p><p>Ghost Mother's expression was solemn, and her movements became faster and faster.</p><p>The forbidden array was very complex, and Ghost Mother spent several hours, until dawn, before finally completing it.</p><p>Wiping the sweat from her forehead, Ghost Mother let out a soft sigh, and pointed her joined fingers at Ya Gu's forehead, just as she was about to do something, she suddenly stopped and turned to ask Qin Sang: "The E'gu marks on her body were personally engraved by you?"</p><p>"It was me."</p><p>Ghost Mother took a step back, "Next, we need to continue engraving the divine runes, using the power of the divine runes to pry open the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, guide her consciousness, and it will also be the foundation for waking her up in the future. You should do it, to avoid you suspecting that I'm doing something to her."</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang took over from Ghost Mother without hesitation.</p><p>"These divine runes are very complex, it shouldn't be a problem for you. Stabilize your True Qi, do as I say," Ghost Mother patiently guided Qin Sang, detailing every step.</p><p>Qin Sang meticulously used his hand as a pen and True Qi as ink, starting from Ya Gu's forehead, carefully depicting the divine runes. In the process of engraving the divine runes, he gradually sensed Ya Gu's changes.</p><p>Her breath became clearer, the light of the forbidden array shone on her body, giving her a hazy veil, her features seemed to have a little more vitality, ready to wake up and open her eyes.</p><p>"Let the divine silkworm return!"</p><p>Ghost Mother's voice rang out.</p><p>The fat silkworm is Ya Gu's anchor in the mortal world, and now her power must be used.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately commanded the fat silkworm to return to Ya Gu's primordial spirit, simultaneously completing the last stroke of the divine rune. The fat silkworm fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely felt that there seemed to be a new connection between Ya Gu and the fat silkworm. He carefully examined Ya Gu, but he couldn't see any changes on the outside.</p><p>After waiting for a while.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but glance at Ghost Mother. At Ghost Mother's gesture, he activated his spiritual sense, probed into Ya Gu's Purple Mansion, and called Ya Gu's consciousness through the fat silkworm.</p><p>Whispers unheard, calls unanswered, sinking into the silent depths.  Qin Sang didn't give up, tirelessly calling out, until finally, after five hundred years, a response!</p><p>"...I... will..."</p><p>The voice was barely audible.  Like someone fallen into a bottomless chasm, screaming for help, their cries lost in the unending darkness and despair. She had persisted for five hundred years, and finally, a breeze stirred in the abyss, carrying her plea to the surface.</p><p>Even so, the reply was incredibly faint, despite Ya Gu's best efforts.</p><p>Qin Sang, as if separated by eons, was momentarily stunned before understanding Ya Gu's meaning.  Ya Gu had heard his conversation with Gui Mu.</p><p>Previous signs indicated Ya Gu could only maintain her consciousness through the fat silkworm,  perceiving external changes only when the silkworm experienced significant fluctuations, much like when Qin Sang escaped into the poison pool in the Qisha Hall.</p><p>With her condition improving, she could now perceive the outside world, though unable to respond.  She was willing to leave with Gui Mu.</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent.  He'd imagined what Ya Gu might say upon awakening, never expecting this to be her first words, not even asking about Gui Mu's nature, good or evil.</p><p>"Don't feel indebted to me, and don't think selling yourself will repay me. That Wu clan cultivator has long since perished. The Demon Chaos War was so devastating; their remains might be scattered, their possessions looted.  The chances of anything surviving are slim. I am of the Human race, and my path to ascension lies within my own people. Remember, live for yourself..."</p><p>Qin Sang clearly explained the risks to Ya Gu, not fearing Gui Mu might overhear.  Gui Mu remembered Tan Hao's life-saving grace, suggesting she wasn't entirely malevolent, but she held many unknown secrets, and Ya Gu's involvement could lead to unpredictable consequences.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang wasn't particularly interested in the Wu cultivator's relics; even if obtained, they might not be useful to him.</p><p>What Gui Mu wouldn't have guessed was that his true interest lay in the Nanhai Immortal Palace itself.  He intended to lower the value of Gui Mu's leverage, seeking entry to the Nanhai Immortal Palace through an alternative trade, such as assisting Gui Mu in finding the cultivator's relics.</p><p>...</p><p>Gui Mu's expression shifted slightly but she offered no rebuttal.  She had to admit Qin Sang spoke the truth; finding the cultivator's remains was highly improbable, otherwise, she wouldn't be so fixated on Ya Gu.</p><p>Finding the remains didn't guarantee the sea chart.  Zhongzhou and Canglang Sea had virtually no contact, indicating a distance far greater than that to the North Sea.</p><p>Currently, the storm zone was rife with ferocious beasts and perilous dangers, making sea travel extremely hazardous.</p><p>There was another reason, one she didn't reveal. She was Ya Gu's lifeline, and vice-versa.</p><p>The destruction of the Jinghai Sect's ancient demon wasn't simply a matter of the ancient seal erasing its true nature.</p><p>Breaking the seal only prolonged Gui Mu's life.  She sensed her time was short, though uncertain how long she could endure, but knew returning sooner was better.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't imagine her overwhelming joy at seeing Ya Gu.  If not for her immense composure, she would have surely burst into unrestrained laughter.</p><p>After a long while, Ya Gu responded again.</p><p>"...I... want... to... grow stronger!"</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless.  Gui Mu smiled.</p><p>After a long silence, Qin Sang said to Gui Mu, "Take her as your disciple."</p><p>Gui Mu laughed, "To take the master of the Divine Silkworm as a disciple is a dream for countless powerful figures of the Wu clan. It's I who am fortunate. You will come to appreciate this choice. I will treat her as my own child, and I swear it."</p><p>"I must witness her return with my own eyes."</p><p>"I need to find a suitable place to set up the formation first, and then I'll tell you the location." Gui Mu readily agreed.</p><p>The karmic oath was simple.  The causal oath, however, required setting up an altar.</p><p>Preparing the altar took a day and a night, and unconsciously, it was morning again.  The grand auction was about to start, and Qin Sang wouldn't be able to attend.</p><p>During that time, Qin Sang carefully considered the wording of the oaths, ensuring there were no loopholes, repeatedly calling out to Ya Gu, but receiving no response.  Those two replies seemed to have exhausted all of Ya Gu's strength.</p><p>The altar was complete. Qin Sang and Gui Mu offered incense and performed nine prostrations, completing the oaths.  Gui Mu also swore to take Ya Gu as her disciple.</p><p>Fulfiling her promise, Gui Mu gave Qin Sang a jade slip, "This is the insect-controlling secret art, the *Panhu True Scripture*.  This is the art I cultivate, certainly superior to anything you learned in the Canglang Sea. Also, I recall a high-level spirit insect called the Water-Fire Divine Centipede. You may cultivate in that direction.”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly skimmed the "True Scripture of Panhu," finding its advanced techniques—the Ascension Ritual and the Three Spirits Pan Wang Formation—remarkable.  However, the Fire Jade Centipede presented a challenge.  Water and fire are incompatible; how could he induce the Fire Jade Centipede to mutate in the desired direction?</p><p>Gui Mu was generous, sharing her cultivation experiences without reservation.  Finally, she said, "The way into the South Sea Immortal Palace is simple. I'll teach you the Bone-Seeking Secret Technique. Go to Taiyue Gate in South Province immediately; you still have time."</p><p>"Now?" Qin Sang's expression changed. "The Ullambana Festival is in three days. Who would open the South Sea Immortal Palace at this time?"</p><p>"The remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, secretly forming the Gu God Cult and rallying their old followers, are plotting against the South Sea Immortal Palace," Gui Mu explained. "They intend to use the Ullambana Festival to lure top experts from the Eight Scenery Sect and others north, creating chaos in the Southern Frontier while they act.  But the Eight Scenery Sect isn't easy; the Buddhist and Daoist sects, now the dominant powers after the Wuxiang Sect's fall, surely know something about the South Sea Immortal Palace. I followed the Eight Scenery Sect to Jinyu Province, hoping to capture a key figure for questioning. Unfortunately, they stayed together, giving me no opportunity to strike.  Only when I met you did I realize their leader was likely an imposter.  Ha! The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind it—you're bound to see a good show."</p><p>…</p><p>The Gu God Cult, the Eight Scenery Sect, Taiyue Gate…  The seemingly peaceful cultivation world was actually seething with undercurrents.  The Gu God Cult was actually made up of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's remnants! Qin Sang, preoccupied with his transformation, almost missed the opportunity related to the South Sea Immortal Palace because he hadn't contacted the Gu God Cult.</p><p>"Those in the Gu God Cult are cautious, revealing little information," Gui Mu continued.  "Through my methods, I discovered the entrance to the South Sea Immortal Palace isn't at Taiyue Gate. You must first enter the old site of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. There's a teleportation array leading to the South Sea Immortal Palace there.  When the Wuxiang Immortal Sect fell, surviving experts sealed the mountain gate to prevent usurpation. Only the Wuxiang Sect's descendants know how to open it. The surviving members were hunted and scattered, which is why it's so hard to find."</p><p>The more Qin Sang heard, the more uneasy he felt. "Aren't you going?"</p><p>"Someone else is already there," Gui Mu said frankly. "Why should I risk myself in this conflict?  Nothing is more important to me than returning.  The treasures of the Immortal Palace are of no use to me. Though Huashen is missing, my cultivation is limited, and I am not immortal."</p><p>Gui Mu made no secret of her fear of danger.  Huashen's remains were secondary. The South Sea Immortal Palace and the Wuxiang Immortal Sect were crucial to the "Chapter on Nurturing Swords with the Yuan Shen," and Qin Sang was determined to obtain it—he had to go.</p><p>Taiyue Gate was far away in South Province; a swift decision was necessary.  Hesitation leads to chaos!</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Ya Gu, sighed, and said solemnly, "I entrust her to your care, Senior.  Perhaps you could take Ya Gu to Pushan in Zhuozhou. I will go to South Province now."</p><p>Before his departure, Gui Mu stopped Qin Sang.  To his surprise, she summoned the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm, sensing trouble, thrashed wildly, emitting pitiful cries, before receiving a sharp tap on its head from Gui Mu.</p><p>Gui Mu scolded, "Behave yourself! You're lazy and lack any of a divine silkworm's grace. I will train you properly to avoid sullying the name of divine silkworms!"</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's eyes glazed over; it looked lifeless and resigned to its fate.  Gui Mu's palm glowed with a white light, enveloping the Fat Silkworm. The light intensified; occasionally the silkworm cried out in pain, quickly swallowing its whimpers for fear of further punishment.</p><p>Soon, a seven-colored light appeared, separating a poison pearl from the Fat Silkworm's body. The Fat Silkworm lay limp, barely breathing. Gui Mu handed the pearl to Qin Sang. "To awaken the divine silkworm bloodline, other factors must be eliminated. This separated poison pearl inherits some of its abilities, making it a valuable treasure.  You will have to understand its power yourself."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. Seeing his hesitation, Gui Mu looked at Ya Gu with pity.  "This is what she wants as well."</p><p>Five hundred years of unwavering devotion—how could she repay such kindness? This poison bead is all she can offer.  You know the power of inner demons, right? You wouldn't want her to carry this burden, would you?"</p><p>Qin Sang was silent. He took the poison bead, went to the mute woman, gently placed his hands on her shoulders, and gazed at her closed eyes.  "Be strong!"</p><p>Fei Can, the fat silkworm, inched its plump body onto Qin Sang's hand, biting his finger. A "snap" was heard as several teeth broke off.  It looked utterly pitiful.</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless. He was a cultivator with an iron-hard body, his physique comparable to a demon king.  Besides, Fei Can was at its weakest.</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing Fei Can's pitiful state, Qin Sang softened his skin to see what it wanted.</p><p>Fei Can bit a hole, licking Qin Sang's blood.  It seemed to sense its separation from Qin Sang, rubbing against his hand, reluctant to leave.</p><p>"You weren't raised for nothing."</p><p>Qin Sang felt no change. He patted Fei Can's head and, with a heavy heart, handed it to Gui Mu.</p><p>The morning light was still dim.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure sped through the mountains.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Gui Mu sat down beside the mute woman, turning her towards the cave entrance. She gently brushed the woman's eyes, whispering, "Take one last look at him."</p><p>The mute woman opened her eyes. Her expression remained stiff, but a flicker of light seemed to flash in her pupils.</p><p>"Why didn't you tell him how you felt? Once you go with me to that other world, you may never see each other again," Gui Mu wondered.</p><p>"I...don't...have...the right."</p><p>The mute woman's reply was still broken, less strained than before, but filled with bitterness.</p><p>Gui Mu sighed, "I thought this would take more persuasion. You're more perceptive than I expected. Mute woman…"</p><p>"My name…is Jin Liuying!"</p><p>"Good! I'll help you be Jin Liuying again! Tell me, what are you thinking?"</p><p>"I…hope…this is…the last…time…I…see…Brother Qin's…back…"</p><p>Gui Mu understood. "To stand before him proudly, that's not so easy. Your Brother Qin, he can reach the peak in this broken world, one day he will soar to great heights, his future is limitless. Your resolve isn't strong enough."</p><p>"I swear it!"</p><p>(End)</p><p>39314342...</p>
