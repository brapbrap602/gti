<h1>Chapter 922: Sea Toad Island</h1><p>“It seems you don’t dislike cultivators. Why have you refused my offer all this time? I, Qin, am not exactly a nobody among cultivators. You know better than anyone how strong I am now. I wouldn't dare say Nascent Soul is a certainty, but my chances are much higher than others. Following me won't disgrace you.”</p><p>Qin Sang flew swiftly, looking down at the Twin-Headed Serpent.</p><p>He knew that the Twin-Headed Serpent was only superficially close to him. He had left that green shadow as a reward for the girl’s ‘grooming’ over the years.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent seemed to understand. With a flash, it entered the Mixed Primordial Bracelet to rest.</p><p>Qin Sang stroked his chin, called his avatar, and they soared away, disappearing into the vast sea.</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>Qin Sang visited Crooked Constant Island. After a few days, he departed and headed straight towards Ascending Fortune Island, making almost no stops along the way.</p><p>After a long journey, he returned to Ascending Fortune Island.</p><p>A trace of emotion flitted across Qin Sang's face. Out of caution, he had his avatar enter the Heavenly Corpse Coffin and blended into the city, keeping a low profile.</p><p>After some inquiries, Qin Sang learned that the teleportation arrays between Ascending Fortune Island and Great Desolate Island in the Demon Sea were operating normally, allowing free travel between them. However, the required spirit stones were almost half again as expensive as before, causing widespread complaints.</p><p>The Demon Sea was gradually returning to normal.</p><p>Of course, it was certainly more dangerous than before the Demon Calamity.</p><p>Qin Sang, assuming the identity of Daoist Clearwind, contacted members of the Vast Expanse Trading Company and learned that Elder Zou was still in the Demon Sea. He decided to visit the Demon Sea in a while to see Elder Zou.</p><p>He had previously sent a letter to Elder Zou, explaining that he would be in seclusion for a period of time.</p><p>Since they were both going to the Seven Killing Palace, though their purposes differed, they might encounter each other inside and could look out for one another. He had also promised Elder Zou that he would help him plan his trip to the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>However, before leaving, he needed to refine the Heavenly Corpse Coffin again.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the marketplace, found a place that rented refining rooms, and rented one at a high price.</p><p>The stone room was only about ten feet square. A bronze cauldron sat in the center, and beneath it was a hole sealed by a restriction. Looking down from above, one could only see a dark red glow.</p><p>Even with the restriction, waves of heat could still be felt surging up from the ground.</p><p>A complex spirit array was set at the opening of the hole.</p><p>Qin Sang first checked the restrictions of the refining room and added a few layers of his own. He instructed his avatar to stand guard and then sat cross-legged in front of the bronze cauldron, taking out the Heavenly Corpse Coffin, Black Origin Metal, and other spirit materials.</p><p>He had pondered the refining plan countless times in his mind.</p><p>After adjusting his state to its peak, Qin Sang reached out and pressed his hand against the bronze cauldron.</p><p>As he touched the restriction, the cauldron glowed brightly and emitted a deep humming sound.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a dazzlingly bright crimson light flashed from the hole below, and a wave of heat rushed towards him, as if a fiery dragon were soaring straight up from the ground.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The restrictions in the stone room trembled violently. Qin Sang's face was illuminated by the flames. His eyes narrowed slightly, and he saw a raging fire ignite beneath the bronze cauldron.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the flames were not tangible.</p><p>The spirit array at the opening of the hole was also activated, emitting an extremely pure fiery aura.</p><p>This power was exceptionally stable, ideal for refining tools and pills.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard that the best of these underground fire veins was the Mountain within a Mountain of the Illusory Spirit Sect in the Minor Cold Region. It was said that due to the terrain, this mountain was constantly being tempered, and the flames were so pure that they were comparable to spirit fire without such complicated procedures.</p><p>Qin Sang placed the Black Origin Metal into the bronze cauldron, activated the spirit array, and began patiently refining.</p><p>Since the Heavenly Corpse Coffin was already a magical treasure, the difficulty of refining it again was not great. The refining process went very smoothly. In just one night, Qin Sang completed the refinement of the Heavenly Corpse Coffin.</p><p>Black lines appeared on the surface of the Heavenly Corpse Coffin, greatly increasing its defensive power.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang didn't stay in Ascending Fortune City for long. He teleported directly to the Demon Sea. He was very careful, wary of the Lantern Fighting Sect, but fortunately, his journey was uneventful.</p><p>Two months later, Qin Sang met Elder Zou on an island in the Demon Sea.</p><p>After a long separation, Elder Zou was overjoyed.</p><p>“Daoist, you’ve been in seclusion for decades without any news. I’ve been worried about you,” Elder Zou said with emotion. He noticed that Qin Sang’s cultivation seemed to have not progressed much, which he found strange, but tactfully, he didn't ask further.</p><p>“The Seven Killing Palace is about to open. This humble Daoist has never forgotten the agreement we made all those years ago. Has Elder Zou discovered any news?”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the greeting and asked.</p><p>“Over the years, this old man has rarely managed the trading company’s affairs and has been gathering information. I've found some that may be useful to me, but it's hard to tell what's true and what's false…”</p><p>Elder Zou shook his head and invited Qin Sang to sit down.</p><p>The two examined the information, discerning its authenticity.</p><p>Qin Sang had only entered the Seven Killing Palace once, so he could only offer advice for reference.  Ultimately, Elder Zou had to make his own decisions.</p><p>Learning that Elder Zou, like last time, planned to enter the Seven Killing Palace using the East Zenith League's qualifications, Qin Sang couldn't say anything directly, but he hinted at a few things.</p><p>With Elder Zou's shrewdness, he would certainly understand.</p><p>As for whether Elder Zou would change his mind, that wasn't something Qin Sang could control.</p><p>“I had intended to help Daoist secure a spot, but I didn't expect that you had already obtained a jade talisman elsewhere. So, after entering the Seven Killing Palace, we won’t be able to travel together."</p><p>Elder Zou was somewhat surprised.</p><p>He had wanted to invite Qin Sang along, as he had known him for so many years, and was more trustworthy than others.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and sighed, “Elder Zou must have noticed the issue with this humble Daoist's cultivation. It hasn't progressed at all these years. There are a few places I must go. The Seven Killing Palace is my only opportunity. I’m afraid it will be difficult for me to focus on other things before resolving my own troubles.”</p><p>Elder Zou nodded. "Then this old man can only wish Daoist success and a safe return. After entering the Seven Killing Palace, I will certainly explore these places one by one. If Daoist successfully resolves your troubles, or encounters any difficulties, you can come find me. The two of us working together is always better than facing challenges alone. This old man still has some savings. If Daoist can help me find those few spirit herbs, the reward certainly won't disappoint you."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. "This humble Daoist will remember that."</p><p>After that, Qin Sang stayed with Elder Zou for a few more days, learning about the latest situation in the Demon Sea from him. They agreed to meet again on Ascending Fortune Island before the Seven Killing Palace opened. Then, Qin Sang left alone, his whereabouts unknown.</p><p>With the demon tribes subdued, after a brief period of quiet, the human and witch tribes continued their expansion.</p><p>The previously severed sea routes were quickly reopened, and exchanges between the two sides became increasingly frequent. It seemed that it wouldn't be long before the former prosperity would be restored.</p><p>Three years passed peacefully.</p><p>Sea Toad Island.</p><p>Once renowned in the Demon Sea, its fame stemmed from its island master, Patriarch Sea Toad, a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator with a fearsome reputation.</p><p>During the Demon Calamity, Patriarch Sea Toad was forced to abandon the island.</p><p>When the calamity ended, he immediately returned with his disciples, and Sea Toad Island quickly prospered once more.</p><p>At noon, a merchant ship docked at Sea Toad Island, and several witch cultivators disembarked.</p>
