<h1>Chapter 1,236: The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet</h1><p>Gong Liangyu stood at the entrance of the cave, glancing around before flicking his fingers to release over a dozen streaks of blue light. Within the blue light were talismans, each no larger than a chess piece, crafted from spirit jade and exuding an air of profound mystery. Like celestial maidens scattering flowers, the talismans landed around the cave entrance, forming an intricate warning array. Some talismans concealed themselves in the void, while others vanished into the rocks and ground, leaving no trace.</p><p>After setting up the talismans, Gong Liangyu swiftly entered the cave. Not long after he left, Dongyang Bo arrived at the spot where Gong Liangyu had stood. A faint white light shimmered as the Diamond Ring in his hand vibrated gently, emitting subtle ripples that accurately located each talisman. With ease, the ripples masked the talismans' senses, allowing Dongyang Bo to pass through the array undetected. Once the Diamond Ring's ripples faded, the talismans remained undisturbed, completely unaware that someone had slipped through their defenses.</p><p>Shortly after, a third figure appeared. Qin Sang had observed Gong Liangyu's every move clearly. He had seen similar techniques before. Back in the ancient cultivator's ruins, the Crippled Elder had schemed against Daoist Xuanyu, forcing Qin Sang to scout ahead precisely because Daoist Xuanyu had left similar talismans as a warning along the path. However, Gong Liangyu's mastery was evidently far superior to Daoist Xuanyu's. These talismans were interconnected, forming an exceptionally complex array. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator, if caught off guard, might trigger the talismans and alert Gong Liangyu.</p><p>With the aid of his Heaven-Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang could discern the intricacies of the array, though he couldn't bypass it as effortlessly as Dongyang Bo. It seemed Dongyang Bo had planned this meticulously, having thoroughly studied Gong Liangyu's methods beforehand. Silently activating his Heaven-Eye Divine Ability, Qin Sang gained a complete understanding of the array. Suddenly, his aura shifted dramatically, as if he himself had transformed into a sharp sword. Sword intent pressed against the array, and a faint sword light erupted from his body, slashing through the void. The sword energy vanished in an instant, as though it had never existed, and Qin桑 followed the sword light into the cave.</p><p>One after another, the three entered, leaving only the talisman array guarding the entrance. Upon entering the cave, they discovered an astonishingly vast interior. Beneath the hills lay an empty expanse, as if a great river had once flowed through, carving out a massive riverbed that stretched for hundreds of miles, its depths unfathomable.</p><p>Gong Liangyu hovered above the Blood River, his expression grave. The underground river had vanished, but the area was now filled with thick blood mist, resembling a surging river of blood that flowed along the ancient riverbed. The sinister energy here was even more intense. However, what worried Gong Liangyu most wasn't the malevolent aura. According to the information he had obtained, the Blood Spirit Grass grew at the bottom of the Blood River. To find it, he would have to venture into the river itself. Yet, the Blood River was far from calm beneath its surface. Despite his considerable cultivation, Gong Liangyu could sense that the river harbored many threats. The riverbed would undoubtedly be even more perilous, and with his current strength, retrieving treasures from such a place seemed impossible.</p><p>Gong Liangyu's expression shifted as he stared at the Blood River, seemingly grappling with a difficult decision. Finally, he steeled himself and raised the hand holding the jade pendant to his face. A shadow of his primordial spirit emerged from his brow, releasing a strand of divine sense that landed on the pendant.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The jade pendant shattered instantly, crumbling into fine powder. In its place, a ball of azure light remained. With a flick of his divine sense, Gong Liangyu enveloped the azure light and absorbed it into his primordial spirit. His eyes immediately cleared, and his mind felt unprecedentedly stable, free of all distractions. Within his dantian, the azure light flickered, protecting his primordial spirit.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Gong Liangyu raised his other hand. In it was a small figurine. Knowing there was no turning back, he decisively formed a hand seal and removed the yellow talisman from the figurine's brow.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>In an instant, the figurine erupted with radiant light. Within the glow, countless illusory talismans flickered, and behind them, shadowy figures appeared—some in agony, others in madness, some laughing maniacally, others screaming—a chaotic dance of demons. Seeing these phantoms, a trace of fear flickered across Gong Liangyu's face.</p><p>*Hum! Hum!*</p><p>The figurine came to life, thrashing violently with immense strength. Sensing that the figurine was on the verge of breaking free, Gong Liangyu's expression changed. Without hesitation, he spat out a mouthful of vital blood and, following his sect's secret technique, formed a series of hand seals that merged into the figurine's body.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The palm-sized statue rapidly expanded, growing to the size of an average person. It stood before Gong Liangyu, its featureless face now facing him. However, the face began to writhe, its features twisting grotesquely. In the blink of an eye, the figurine's face grew features—and to Gong Liangyu's horror, it bore an uncanny resemblance to his own, as if it were his twin brother.</p><p>Staring at the face, Gong Liangyu felt as though he were looking into a mirror. A sense of unease and discomfort washed over him. At that moment, the figurine suddenly opened its eyes, its pupils pitch black and filled with madness. A sinister smile curled its lips, sending a chill down Gong Liangyu's spine.</p><p>Simultaneously, a terrifying aura erupted from the figurine, instantly surpassing Gong Liangyu's own and reaching the level of a Nascent Soul cultivator. This was one of the Four Great Secret Talismans of the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace—the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet!</p><p>Among the Four Great Secret Talismans, the Heavenly Blade Talisman, the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, and the Inner Landscape Primordial Talisman were all conventional spirit talismans. Only the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet resembled a puppet. It was created by the founding ancestor of the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace, who drew upon the art of talisman soldiers and combined it with other puppet techniques, demonic soul-refining arts, and other profound secrets. By chance, he had crafted this talisman puppet. After the ancestor's passing, the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet was left to the sect as a treasure to protect the lineage.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet served as the guardian of the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace and possessed other astonishing abilities. Thanks to this puppet, the sect had weathered countless calamities, enduring through lows and remaining a top-tier sect to this day. It was rumored that the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet could not be taken outside the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace. Throughout history, disciples of the sect had only activated the puppet when the sect faced dire threats, such as enemy forces storming their mountain gates. Combined with the sect's protective formations, the Nascent Soul-level puppet made their defenses impregnable. Outside the sect's gates, no one had ever seen a Shangyuan Qingjing Palace cultivator use the puppet in battle.</p><p>Yet now, Gong Liangyu had brought the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet out with him, suggesting that the rumors were either mistaken or that the sect had deliberately concealed the truth for some reason. Gong Liangyu had awakened the puppet to aid him in retrieving treasures from the Blood River. However, his demeanor was far from normal; he seemed deeply fearful of the puppet. This was because the puppet, as crafted by the founding ancestor, had inherent flaws. Over countless years, it had grown even more sinister, and many of its other functions had deteriorated. Each time the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace activated the puppet, they paid a heavy price—a classic case of "inflicting a thousand wounds on the enemy while suffering eight hundred themselves."</p>
