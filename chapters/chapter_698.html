<h1>Chapter 690: Golden Radiance Armor</h1><p>The newcomer's attire resembled the young man in black robes, but he appeared much older.</p><p>Having lost his quarry, he remained unwilling to give up, releasing his natal Gu insects to search everywhere.  Just then, another streak of light flew from afar, and a middle-aged man, similarly clad in black robes, swiftly arrived.</p><p>The middle-aged man landed, his gaze sweeping the area. Finding only the elder, he frowned and asked, "Fifth Junior Brother, why are you alone? Where's Little Junior Brother and the person he was tracking?"</p><p>"Third Senior Brother, Little Junior Brother, he..."</p><p>The elder stammered, unable to speak.</p><p>Seeing the elder's expression, a sense of foreboding rose in the middle-aged man's heart. His face darkened abruptly, and he roared, "Speak! What happened?!"</p><p>The elder's face was ashen. "I don't know what happened. I heard the sound of the Thunder Talisman and rushed over with all my might. When I arrived, Little Junior Brother was already dead..."</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>The middle-aged man's eyes instantly became bloodshot, staring fixedly at the elder. "You just watched Little Junior Brother get killed and let the murderer escape?!"</p><p>The elder shrank his head, whispering, "The murderer's escape speed was no slower than even Eldest Senior Brother's. I only saw a flash of red before he easily shook me off. Although my cultivation is a realm higher than Little Junior Brother's, he possessed supreme treasures and was even stronger than me. Little Junior Brother used the Thunder Talisman, yet that person remained unharmed..."</p><p>"There was only one person?"</p><p>Hearing this, the middle-aged man's pupils constricted. He spoke gravely, "The Thunder Talisman and the Golden Radiance Armor bestowed upon Little Junior Brother by Master were supreme treasures for his protection. We rushed here immediately upon receiving his signal. Even if Little Junior Brother encountered a late Core Formation cultivator, he wouldn't have perished so quickly. This person withstood the Thunder Talisman, easily broke through the Golden Radiance Armor, and has an escape speed comparable to Eldest Senior Brother’s. Could it be one of the top experts from the Volcanic Island? But those individuals were recruited by Old Monster Lin. Now, Old Monster Lin doesn't want to get involved in this mess, sealing off the island. They've all been confined to closed-door cultivation... Who else could it be?"</p><p>The more the elder thought about it, the more afraid he became, his face a picture of misery. "Third Senior Brother, Little Junior Brother was Master's favorite. Now he's lost his life in the Demonic Sea. How can we explain this to Master when we return?"</p><p>The middle-aged man was clearly also afraid. After a moment of hesitation, he sighed deeply. "Since things have come to this, we can only wait for Eldest Senior Brother to decide..."</p><p>…</p><p>Elsewhere, after fleeing some distance, Qin Sang began to conceal himself, but he still dared not lower his guard.</p><p>Although Qin Sang couldn't hear the discussion between the young man in black robes and his senior brother, he knew they wouldn't let this go. It was best to keep a low profile for the time being.</p><p>Although the young man’s cultivation wasn't high, the treasures he possessed were astonishingly numerous. The power of the Thunder Talisman was terrifying, and Qin Sang still felt a lingering fear. In fact, if not for the Bloodfiend Divine Light, Qin Sang would have been troubled by the young man’s tough inner armor alone, and it likely would have been difficult to kill him before his companions arrived.</p><p>It was conceivable that the young man's companions wouldn't be weak either.  If he encountered others, Qin Sang wasn't confident he could defeat them and would rather avoid them.</p><p>Only after confirming no one was following did Qin Sang secretly breathe a sigh of relief. He took out several items to examine them.</p><p>First were a few fragments of the Blackwater Mirror.</p><p>Struck directly by the Thunder Talisman, the Blackwater Mirror's main body was pierced, and the central part of the artifact was seemingly purified by the divine lightning. The frame shattered into several fragments, which Qin Sang retrieved.</p><p>He hadn't held much hope, and as expected, the surviving fragments were completely devoid of spiritual energy, their inner workings destroyed by the power of the Thunder Talisman. Utterly ruined.</p><p>An excellent artifact, ruined after only a few years of use. Qin Sang felt a pang of heartache, but fortunately, the spoils from the young man in black should compensate for his loss.</p><p>Not rushing to examine the storage pouch, Qin Sang first retrieved the young man's inner armor.</p><p>"He seemed to call it Golden Radiance Armor," Qin Sang muttered to himself, lifting his palm to examine it closely.</p><p>Detached from its owner, the Golden Radiance Armor shrunk to the size of a palm. Tainted by defilement and severely damaged, it emitted only a very faint golden glow.</p><p>"Just a high-grade low-rank artifact… I wonder what spiritual materials were used. It's incredibly tough, comparable to a mid-rank artifact."</p><p>The Golden Radiance Armor's rank wasn't as high as he'd imagined, but Qin Sang wasn't disappointed.</p><p>As a Refiner, he naturally understood the rarity of such inner armor artifacts. Even after being defiled by the Bloodfiend Divine Light and with its spiritual nature greatly diminished, the Golden Radiance Armor withstood consecutive heavy blows from the Ebony Sword and the Nightfiend, without shattering on the spot. This demonstrated its robust nature, making it a top-tier inner armor artifact.</p><p>Even among late Core Formation cultivators, few possessed such inner armor.</p><p>With the Golden Radiance Armor for protection, as long as one didn't encounter a troublesome divine ability like the Bloodfiend Divine Light that specifically countered artifacts, it could protect vital points in critical moments, greatly increasing the chances of survival.</p><p>He wondered if the young man in black had seized it from someone else or if it was bestowed upon him by his sect.</p><p>The defilement from the Bloodfiend Divine Light wasn't difficult to restore, requiring only a period of nurturing. However, the cracks on the armor itself were somewhat troublesome. If not handled correctly, they could impair the Golden Radiance Armor's power.</p><p>Given the urgency of the situation, Qin Sang clearly couldn't consider all of this at the time.</p><p>Staring at the cracks on the Golden Radiance Armor for a moment, Qin Sang had an idea. He first erased the young man's aura, then refined it slightly before storing it in his dantian for nurturing.</p><p>"This inner armor alone is enough to compensate for the loss. I wonder what else is in the storage pouch."</p><p>Qin Sang extended his divine sense into the young man's storage pouch. He immediately saw four artifacts, all damaged to varying degrees, clearly seized from slain opponents.</p><p>This didn't mean the young man had only killed four people. In life-or-death battles between cultivators, neither side would yield until utterly exhausted. When facing death, self-destructing one's artifacts was common.</p><p>Being able to seize so many artifacts was sufficient proof of the young man and his companions' strength.</p><p>Two of the artifacts were others' natal artifacts. While they could be forcibly used, their power would be diminished. Qin Sang's gaze fell on the remaining two.</p><p>A green jade笏board and a scroll, both low-rank artifacts.</p><p>Repairing these two artifacts was much simpler. Qin Sang had many spiritual materials. After refining each one, he planned to find a safe place to begin the repairs.</p><p>Besides the artifacts, there were also a considerable number of pills, demon cores, and other items. Talismans were the most numerous, with a wide variety of functions. It was a pity Qin Sang couldn't find a second Thunder Talisman.  Having a Thunder Talisman for protection would have brought him much greater peace of mind.</p><p>This person's possessions were incredibly abundant. Qin Sang could continue his training without rushing back for supplies.</p><p>However, the appearance of the Witch tribe left Qin Sang uneasy, worried that even hunting demons near the Volcanic Island wouldn't be safe.</p><p>Remaining ignorant and hiding like a turtle certainly wouldn't do.</p><p>Otherwise, when the disaster reached him, it would be too late to react.</p><p>"I'll find a place to avoid the immediate danger first. After repairing the artifacts, I'll go out and investigate. I must find out what changes have occurred on the Volcanic Island."</p>
