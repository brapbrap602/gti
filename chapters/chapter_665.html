<h1>Chapter 657: Transformation and the Life-Bound Insect</h1><p>Chapter 657: Transformation and the Life-Bound Insect</p><p>The fat silkworm ate like a starving ghost.</p><p>It devoured a Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit in the blink of an eye, then smacked its mouth, still wanting more.</p><p>After all the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruits were picked, the tree, having fulfilled its purpose, withered at a visible rate, its leaves turning yellow and dying completely.</p><p>This is why such celestial treasures are rare.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know if a new Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit tree would sprout here in the future.</p><p>After swallowing the unripe Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, the fat silkworm belched, returned to Qin Sang's palm, and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to put it back in the insect basket when she noticed a faint silver light shining from the silkworm's body.  The light grew brighter, almost overshadowing its colorful skin.</p><p>Finally, the silver light separated into strands, wrapping around it, gradually forming a round silver cocoon.</p><p>"Is this a transformation?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. "Can eating an unripe Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit cause a transformation? This thing is really strange. It seems to be its second transformation. Other spirit insects, after their second transformation, possess strength comparable to Foundation Establishment cultivators.  This guy was so useless before; I wonder if it will become stronger after this transformation."</p><p>Having captured the fat silkworm for so long, Qin Sang not only hadn't figured out what kind of spirit insect it was, but also couldn't gauge its level of transformation.</p><p>Witnessing its cocoon formation confirmed it was its second transformation.</p><p>After the cocoon formed, the fat silkworm slept inside, completely still. Qin Sang didn't know how long the transformation would take, so she put it back in the insect basket and waited for it to emerge.</p><p>After taking one last look at the withered Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit tree, Qin Sang erased her traces and left Black Wind Valley.</p><p>Over several days, she erased all her previous traces to prevent the Li Witch Palace from finding any clues.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang returned to the Five Insects Sect and patiently waited for Du Han's arrival.</p><p>…</p><p>The Five Insects Sect's gate had been destroyed in the successive battles, so Qin Sang prepared an ambush, sitting in a crevice in the sect's back mountain, quietly waiting for Du Han's appearance.</p><p>At this time, the Flying Night Rakshasa wasn't by her side.</p><p>A beautiful butterfly danced on her fingertip.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to choose the Heaven Eye Butterfly as her life-bound insect.  The blood refinement would begin now.</p><p>After killing Du Han, Qin Sang would likely travel to human territory to uncover the secrets of the Seven Killing Hall; her time on the Witch God Continent was limited.</p><p>Even if she stayed and spent a few more years, she might not find a better insect than the Heaven Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Heaven Eye Butterfly already met her two most important needs; there was no need to be greedy. The sooner she subdued her life-bound insect, the sooner she could cultivate it and quickly achieve her third transformation.</p><p>Unlike willingly submitting, a spirit insect refined into a life-bound insect would revert to its larval stage before gradually growing stronger.</p><p>Cultivating a life-bound insect is a long process.</p><p>The Heaven Eye Butterfly landed on Qin Sang's finger, an inexplicable restraint preventing it from escaping, from regaining its freedom, no matter how hard it struggled.</p><p>In the sunlight, the Heaven Eye Butterfly shone with astonishing beauty.</p><p>The ruined Five Insects Sect was enhanced by this beautiful butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully recalled every detail of the life-bound insect refinement process. Finally, she guided the Heaven Eye Butterfly to her palm, cautiously extending a strand of spiritual sense into its body.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang cut her fingertip, forcing out a drop of essence blood, and used the blood refinement technique to manipulate the blood.</p><p>The bright red essence blood, guided by the blood refinement technique, separated into countless fine threads, weaving a dense blood net before Qin Sang, incredibly vivid.</p><p>The size of the blood net was just right to cover the Heaven Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang controlled the blood net, slowly drifting towards the Heaven Eye Butterfly.</p><p>If she had chosen an insect egg as her life-bound insect, she wouldn't need to be so careful.  But the Heaven Eye Butterfly was different; it already had its own consciousness and would put up a fierce resistance. Qin Sang had to be careful to avoid injuring it.</p><p>The blood net drew closer, and the Heaven Eye Butterfly, sensing the danger, flapped its wings frantically.</p><p>The light blood net covered the Heaven Eye Butterfly, transforming into blood that seeped into its body.</p><p>However, this time, the blood was strangely uncanny, seeming to contain countless eerie runes that also entered the Heaven Eye Butterfly's body.</p><p>Meanwhile, a strand of Qin Sang's consciousness sensed the Tianmu butterfly's fear and struggle.  However, the disparity between them was too great. Qin Sang remained calm and easily suppressed the butterfly's will.</p><p>Soon, the blood refinement ritual was successfully completed.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt a sudden connection with the Tianmu butterfly, an intense feeling of kinship.</p><p>He had only felt this before with his Wumu sword.</p><p>This was his bonded insect-gu!</p><p>Without pausing, Qin Sang squeezed out more blood, letting it drift towards the Tianmu butterfly, forming a blood cocoon.  Like a fat silkworm, the butterfly fell into a deep sleep within the cocoon.</p><p>However, through their connection, Qin Sang could perceive the butterfly's condition.  He only needed to draw it back into his dantian and nurture it for a few hours, after which it would emerge from the cocoon, truly becoming his bonded insect-gu!</p><p>Qin Sang retracted it into his dantian.</p><p>The Tianmu butterfly was very fragile now, like a newborn, needing careful care.</p><p>Unconsciously, several hours passed.</p><p>The Tianmu butterfly broke free from its cocoon, and Qin Sang released it.</p><p>The butterfly itself hadn't changed much; it was just slightly smaller, its wings and patterns slightly paler.  Additionally, a faint line of blood appeared along the edge of its wings, adding a touch of exotic beauty.</p><p>However, the Tianmu butterfly's behavior had undergone a dramatic change.</p><p>It fluttered around Qin Sang, conveying immense joy and affection, seemingly treating Qin Sang as its closest and most trusted kin.</p><p>Feeling the butterfly's emotions, Qin Sang smiled slightly, gently touched it with a finger, took out a berry, squeezed out the juice, and let the butterfly feed on it.</p><p>Before its second transformation, feeding it regular spirit fruits would suffice.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang only used the finest spirit fruits. Combined with his blood cultivation and golden elixir nurturing, the Tianmu butterfly would begin its second transformation within a few years.</p><p>After its second transformation, he would need to find several unique spirit herbs to supplement its diet, greatly accelerating its growth.</p><p>After eating the fruit, the Tianmu butterfly was once again drawn back into Qin Sang's qi sea.</p><p>…</p><p>Days turned into nights.</p><p>Unknowingly, more than ten days passed.</p><p>Qin Sang sat alone in the silent Wu Chong Gate, remaining motionless for several days, doing nothing but feeding the Tianmu butterfly and meditating.</p><p>That morning.</p><p>Sunlight cast a golden glow.</p><p>Silence reigned over the mountains. Qin Sang's ears twitched; he suddenly opened his eyes, his figure flashed, and he vanished.</p><p>He became invisible, concealing his aura, appearing on the mountaintop, gazing towards the west of the Wu Chong Gate.</p><p>On the distant horizon, a point of golden light was speeding towards them at an incredible rate – clearly a flying artifact, heading straight for the Wu Chong Gate.</p><p>Only a Golden Core cultivator could achieve such speed.</p><p>Du Han was coming!</p>
