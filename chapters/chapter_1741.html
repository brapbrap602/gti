<h1>Chapter 1732: The Changing World</h1><p>Seven Kills Hall's transformation!</p><p>No need to ask to guess what kind of transformation it was.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, a flicker of regret flashing across them.</p><p>He had traveled tens of thousands of miles to the Roiling Sea, holding a sliver of hope for Seven Kills Hall, but unfortunately, things didn't go as planned.</p><p>“Did Su Nu also ascend with the Immortal Hall?”</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's question, Bao Zhengnan and Bao Xi's eyes both subtly shifted.</p><p>They had been watching Qin Sang's expression.</p><p>When mentioning Su Nu, they intentionally avoided saying she ascended, only mentioning the Immortal Hall's transformation.  Qin Sang had seen through it in one sentence, it seemed this person was not entirely ignorant.</p><p>Bao Xi hesitated to speak.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan nodded and replied, “Fellow Daoist Qin also knows that Seven Kills Hall is sealed by Immortal Restrictions, both inside and out. At that time, many cultivators entered the inner hall seeking treasures. When they sensed the transformation, many were trapped within, unable to escape.  Fortunately, while the Immortal Restrictions were difficult to enter, they were relatively easy to exit.  We couldn't contact Su Nu, so we had to use the Heavenly Phoenix Plume to break the inner hall’s Immortal Restrictions and escape Seven Kills Hall.  It wasn't until Seven Kills Hall ascended, tearing through the void, that we saw her alone on the peak of Reaching Heaven Peak, leaving behind only a solitary figure.”</p><p>Recalling the scene from that day,</p><p>both Bao Zhengnan and Bao Xi's expressions were somewhat gloomy.</p><p>After Qin Sang entrusted Su Nu to them, they brought her back to the Four Saints Palace.  Because they admired Qing Zhu's character and desired to befriend both Qing Zhu and Qin Sang, everyone in the Four Saints Palace valued Su Nu greatly.</p><p>Su Nu had nowhere to go after she recovered.</p><p>For her, the Four Saints Palace was a secluded paradise. Here, she could live carefree, without the need to tread on thin ice like before, constantly guarding against others plotting against her. Having received the invitation from the Bao siblings, she stayed.</p><p>In the period before the Immortal Hall ascended, the Bao siblings and Su Nu spent time together day and night, forging a friendship.</p><p>During that time, their most frequent discussions revolved around Qin Sang and Qing Zhu; they were very curious about them.</p><p>Whenever Qin Sang was mentioned, Su Nu always remained silent. The Bao siblings simply thought she was shy, only Su Nu herself knew she had nothing to say, as she didn't understand Qin Sang at all.</p><p>In Seven Kills Hall, Su Nu recognized Qin Sang as the person who had once spared her life. At the time, she had no other options, grasping at straws in desperation.</p><p>Having experienced the warmth and coldness of the world, she was already prepared for Qin Sang to break his promise.</p><p>Being enslaved by Qin Sang was better than being manipulated by the East Pole Alliance Leader.</p><p>At that time, Qin Sang was only a Golden Core cultivator.  Su Nu had great confidence in her acting skills.  She would gain Qin Sang’s trust, and when he let his guard down, she would surely find an opportunity to strike back.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang not only saved her life and actively crushed the Ghost Imprint, freeing her from the suffering of enslavement, but he also helped her find a place to settle down and make a living.</p><p>Su Nu wondered more than once what kind of person he truly was.  Learning about the Demon Subjugation War from the Bao siblings, she also longed to see Qin Sang again.</p><p>Unfortunately, after that, Qing Zhu and Qin Sang seemed to vanish from the world.</p><p>Bao Xi added, “Su Nu helped us obtain the inheritance within the Secret Realm.  The Four Saints Palace has been revitalized because of this. Both my elder brother and I are extremely grateful to her, but we have no opportunity to repay her.  We only wish for her to escape danger once again and safely ascend to the Upper Realm.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>Listening to their tone, it seemed that many cultivators were trapped in the inner hall and 'ascended' with Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>The ascension of the Immortal Hall was something no one had anticipated.</p><p>If it weren't for Old Devil Ye stirring up trouble back then, becoming the public enemy of the North Star Realm and provoking the siege of the three realms, perhaps the number of cultivators trapped in the Violet Palace wouldn't be any less than those in Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Without the protection of the Ascension Platform, unless they possessed extremely profound fortune, the vast majority of those cultivators would perish in the spatial turbulence.</p><p>Could Su Nu have survived?</p><p>Qin Sang slightly raised his head. "Could the two Fellow Daoists describe the scene of Seven Kills Hall’s ascension?”</p><p>He remembered the ethereal Immortal Palace above Seven Kills Hall, a magnificent spectacle.  Compared to the true form of the Violet Palace, it was no less impressive.</p><p>There was also the Demon Monarch sealed beneath Reaching Heaven Peak.  Would the ascension of the Immortal Hall impact the Demon Sealing Restrictions?</p><p>Bao Xi nodded, her lips parting slightly.</p><p>Unlike the Violet Palace, Seven Kills Hall’s inner and outer halls were a single entity, ascending together as they tore through the void.  When the transformation occurred, all the cultivators were exploring the inner hall, searching for secrets.  Though they didn't know where Seven Kills Hall was going, they knew that being taken into the spatial rift by Seven Kills Hall would lead to no good end.</p><p>The cultivators only cared about escaping.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Plume brought in by the Dragon King that year fell into the hands of the Four Saints Palace. Their group ventured too deep and stayed longer to search for Su Nu.  When they discovered Seven Kills Hall was about to ascend, in that critical moment, they destroyed the Heavenly Phoenix Plume to escape with their lives.</p><p>Not only did the human race suffer heavy losses, but a considerable number of Wu Clan cultivators were also taken by Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>After the Demon Subjugation War, the top experts of the human race fell one after another, greatly weakening their strength and facing internal and external troubles. Old Devil Fang proposed to join forces with the human race to explore the inner hall, and they had no choice but to acquiesce.</p><p>For the Wu Clan, this was undoubtedly a good thing.  Facts proved that there were also Wu Clan legacies within the inner hall, perhaps even the opportunity to complete their fragmented inheritance.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before they could find their opportunity in the inner hall, they encountered the ascension of the Immortal Hall.</p><p>This time, the losses were even more severe.  Most of the fallen were Wu Clan Nascent Soul cultivators and rising stars, the backbone of the Wu Clan.  For the declining Wu Clan, this was undoubtedly a heavy blow.</p><p>It was also a calamity for the human race, but with their deep foundation, they could still endure it.</p><p>The Wu Clan had yet to recover. If not for the external conflict with the Yao Clan diverting attention, the human race could likely have invaded the Wu God Continent.</p><p>When Bao Xi spoke of these things, she couldn't help but sigh at the unpredictable nature of the world, how fortune and misfortune were intertwined.</p><p>Returning to the Four Saints Palace group, they only dared to look back after escaping Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>At that time, the Immortal Restrictions outside Seven Kills Hall were in chaos. Above the inner hall, immortal clouds surged, and radiant light filled the sky, revealing a mirage-like image of jade palaces and celestial mansions, dreamlike and illusory.</p><p>Su Nu stood atop Reaching Heaven Peak, the Immortal Palace directly above her.</p><p>The Reaching Heaven Peak beneath her also exhibited strange phenomena.</p><p>Above, the Demon Subduing Stele shone with azure light, illuminating the entire Reaching Heaven Peak, inside and out, like a piece of jade.</p><p>Below the peak, wondrous scenes intertwined. On one side, the phantom of a Divine Furnace appeared, and on the other, a Divine Dragon coiled.</p><p>Between the three, a mass of black Qi pulsed like a heart, revealing a corner of a blood-red coffin.</p><p>The Bao siblings, who had participated in the Demon Subjugation War, knew that the Demon Monarch was sealed within the blood coffin, and the Demon Monarch was clearly still alive.</p><p>Seeing that scene, the Bao siblings were terrified, fearing the Demon Monarch would break free from the seal and bring devastation upon the world.  Immediately afterward, they witnessed the Immortal Hall ascend, tearing through the void.</p><p>The Demon Monarch within the seal and Su Nu were taken away by the Immortal Hall, their whereabouts unknown.</p><p>Bao Xi took great pains to describe the scene at the time and the fate of the cultivators.</p><p>Due to the great distance, they didn't know what Su Nu encountered. With this information alone, Qin Sang couldn't determine if Su Nu had survived.</p><p>The outer hall of Seven Kills Hall had also ascended, different from Qin Sang's expectations. He originally thought that special places like the Heavenly Tower in the outer hall might remain, but he had thought too much.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "Fellow Daoist mentioned just now uniting with the Wu Clan against the Yao Clan, and that several Fellow Daoists must personally guard Heaven's Prosperity Island.  Could it be that the Yao Clan is overwhelmingly powerful and a new war has begun?"</p><p>Bao Xi looked towards her brother.</p><p>Up until now, Bao Xi had done most of the talking, with Bao Zhengnan occasionally adding a few words.</p><p>His expression turned serious. He looked deeply at Qin Sang and, instead of answering his question, asked, "Forgive my presumption, but has Fellow Daoist Qin come from the outer realms?"</p><p>Suddenly disappearing and then suddenly reappearing, with nearly six hundred years of no news in between, and returning with a cultivation level even higher than theirs.</p><p>Such a realm could never be achieved by simply secluding oneself in a cave to cultivate.</p><p>If Qin Sang had never left the Roiling Sea, he couldn't have remained unknown, nor could he have missed the opportunity presented by Seven Kills Hall’s opening.</p><p>There was only one explanation!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over the three, and he nodded, frankly admitting, "Both I and Senior Qing Zhu came from the Northern Sea. The Northern Sea also has an Immortal Hall, connected to Seven Kills Hall by an Immortal Formation. After the Demon Subjugation War, I returned to the Northern Sea. When Seven Kills Hall ascended, the Northern Sea Immortal Hall ascended as well, otherwise I would have come to visit the two of you long ago."</p><p>“Northern Sea?”</p><p>The three exchanged glances, their expressions filled with doubt and curiosity.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his keen perception, noticed the change in their expressions and asked, "Do you not know of the Northern Sea?"</p><p>Bao Zhengnan said, "We’ve heard that there are outer realms beyond the storm, but our knowledge is limited."</p><p>Qin Sang was quite surprised.</p><p>The Four Saints Palace was a Nascent Soul sect. Before the rise of the human race, the Wu Clan also had Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>They shouldn't be completely ignorant of the outside world.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan saw Qin Sang's confusion but didn't explain, instead asking, "Since the teleportation formation is no longer there, how did Fellow Daoist Qin determine the location of the Roiling Sea?"</p><p>"I once traveled through the Middle Continent and obtained a relic from a Wu Clan senior, within which was a sea chart," Qin Sang conjured the sea chart.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan nodded repeatedly after examining it, then suddenly smiled mysteriously, "Fellow Daoist followed this chart here.  Did you find anything near the Roiling Sea that didn't match the chart?"</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly taken aback.  Recalling, there had indeed been such a thing!</p><p>When searching for the last refuge, he hadn't found it at the location marked on the sea chart. He spread his divine sense and searched for a long time before discovering the refuge hundreds of miles away.</p><p>The seas change, and the world transforms.</p><p>Especially within the ever-shifting storm, it wasn't strange for restrictions to be affected and shift. Qin Sang hadn't thought much of it.</p><p>Listening to Bao Zhengnan's tone, it seemed he had anticipated this.  Could there be some hidden reason?</p><p>"It's fortunate that Fellow Daoist came searching when the Immortal Hall ascended.  When Seven Kills Hall was still here, you wouldn't have been able to find the Roiling Sea with just this chart," Bao Zhengnan said something that surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>"I'd like to hear the details," Qin Sang said, puzzled. This was something he hadn't encountered in the other three realms.</p><p>"This was discovered by the Four Saints Ancestors. I also read about it in ancient texts. In the past, when the Wu Clan was powerful, there was no shortage of experts, and they must have also noticed it. Before Seven Kills Hall ascended, there was a peculiar power around the Roiling Sea, difficult to perceive, but it truly existed. This power was like an invisible barrier, encircling the Roiling Sea. Those inside could leave, but those outside couldn't enter. Because the area it covered was so vast, a Nascent Soul cultivator would almost certainly be unable to reach the boundary without stopping to recover spiritual energy mid-flight. We didn't understand the source of this power, only assuming it was a rule of this world, just like the storm barrier.  It wasn't until Seven Kills Hall ascended and the barrier dissipated that the shift occurred."</p><p>Bao Zhengnan's words sounded unbelievable.</p><p>However, Qin Sang kept staring at the location of the last refuge on the sea chart.</p><p>This refuge was very close to the Roiling Sea, but extremely far from the second refuge, a distance only a Nascent Soul cultivator could traverse without pause within the storm.</p><p>The area in between was completely blank!</p><p>Qin Sang then thought of Ghost Mother's experience. She could infiltrate Small Boundless Mountain, but couldn’t gather information about the Wu Clan in the Middle Continent.  If what Bao Zhengnan said was true, and Nascent Soul cultivators from the Roiling Sea could leave, but those from the outside couldn't enter, then it explained why the outside world knew nothing of the Wu Clan.</p><p>"Could it be that Nascent Soul cultivators who originated from the Roiling Sea were unable to return after leaving?" Qin Sang asked in return.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan hesitated. "That, I do not know. However, according to the ancient texts, our ancestor, Bao Gu, never returned to the palace after leaving.  This Wu Clan senior, by leaving this sea chart, perhaps wished to use it to find a way to travel between the inside and outside."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, recalling his experiences in each realm.</p><p>The Immortal Halls in each realm were connected, yet possessed different mystical properties.</p><p>The Immortal Palace of the Northern Sea's Violet Palace concealed itself; the Middle Continent's Immortal Hall had two interconnected halls; the Western Earth's Immortal Hall remained dormant and hidden.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s silence, Bao Zhengnan added, "The Roiling Sea wasn't the only place protected by Seven Kills Hall, there was also the Yao Sea."</p><p>“Yao Sea?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression was one of surprise. “Could it be…”</p><p>“Just as Fellow Daoist suspects.  In truth, the distance between the Roiling Sea and the Yao Sea is not that great. Both were protected by Seven Kills Hall, yet also separated by it, unable to reach each other and thus not interfering with one another. Back then, the Four Ancestors might have vaguely discovered something.  They accidentally entered the Yao Sea through Seven Kills Hall, but they couldn’t determine the exact distance between the Roiling Sea and the Yao Sea. However, the teleportation formation between the two realms was established at that time.  Our ancestors also passed down the Yao-Slaying Pill, hunting Yao beasts to refine pills, which led to the rise of the human race."</p><p>Speaking of this, Bao Zhengnan sighed, "We control the teleportation formation, able to come and go as we please.  Even if the Yao Clan of the Yao Sea surpassed us in strength, they could only passively endure our attacks. But after Seven Kills Hall ascended and the barrier vanished, the situation changed. The distance between the two realms is closer than imagined. The Yao Sea is located southeast of the Roiling Sea.  Transformation stage Yao Kings can directly cross the storm belt and reach the Roiling Sea.”</p><p>He looked deeply at Qin Sang. "Fellow Daoist can likely imagine our fear upon discovering that the Yao Clan could directly invade our heartland. At that time, both races suffered calamities, losing countless experts in Seven Kills Hall, while the Yao Sea only lost one Dragon King. If the Yao Clan had launched a full-scale invasion, both races might have ceased to exist, and Fellow Daoist wouldn't be seeing us today..."</p><p>Both Bao Xi and Zhuo Ming revealed expressions of lingering fear.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan didn't elaborate on the experiences of these past few hundred years, but one could imagine the arduous struggles. Fortunately, the Four Saints Palace had obtained a great inheritance, producing many powerful cultivators, and managed to withstand the Yao Clan's offensive.</p><p>Even now, the relationship between the two realms remained extremely tense, requiring Bao Zhengnan and Zhuo Ming to personally guard Heaven's Prosperity Island.</p><p>Qin Sang also hadn't expected the Roiling Sea and the Yao Sea to be neighboring realms.</p><p>Compared to the other three realms, these two were unique.</p><p>The Roiling Sea was the domain of the Wu Clan before the rise of the human race.</p><p>The Yao Sea was the territory of the Yao Clan.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang also noticed another point:  the overall strength of the Yao Clan in the Yao Sea might be inferior to that of the Middle Continent’s Yao Clan, but the Yao Sea’s Yao Clan possessed many unique bloodlines. He had only seen descendants of divine beasts and celestial Yao, such as the Heavenly Phoenix and the Nine-Headed Bird, in the Yao Sea. Their origins were definitely not simple.</p><p>The two realms being protected by Seven Kills Hall was likely intentionally arranged by their ancestors, allowing the Wu Clan and the Yao Clan to recuperate and avoid harassment from the human race.</p><p>Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned. The human race in the Roiling Sea eventually rose to power.</p><p>At this moment, Zhuo Ming, who had been mostly silent, couldn't help but speak, "The storm is now teeming with ferocious beasts, fraught with danger. Fellow Daoist, traveling everywhere, aren’t you afraid of encountering them?"</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
