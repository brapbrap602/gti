<h1>Chapter 191 Seeking the Dao</h1><p>Chapter 191 Seeking the Dao</p><p>“Let’s wait until she wakes up and see what she wants to do.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Su Nu, who was still asleep.</p><p>He and Su Nu had only met a few times.  The few times he had saved her were for other reasons; he hadn’t had much contact with her.</p><p>Qin Sang crushed the ghost seal, not treating Su Nu as a true soul slave.</p><p>Firstly, he owed Su Nu a debt for surviving this ordeal.</p><p>Secondly, after the experience with the two-headed creature, Qin Sang understood that forcing someone’s will never lasts; it only creates resentment.</p><p>The two-headed creature had been with him for many years, yet even the Blood Domination Fruit couldn’t tempt it to give up its pursuit of freedom. It preferred to be bait than remain controlled.</p><p>Even beasts felt this way, let alone humans.</p><p>Su Nu would never willingly be another's soul slave; she would have a backup plan.  Considering this woman's ruthless methods of turning someone into a soul slave, Qin Sang doubted he could even sleep soundly if he kept her by his side.</p><p>It was better to let her go and make a good impression.</p><p>Bidding farewell to the Bao siblings, Qin Sang followed Qing Zhu.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi and the elder did not stop them.</p><p>Qing Zhu took Qin Sang, flew out of the space, crossed the river, returned to Yitian Peak, and silently flew towards the summit.</p><p>Suddenly, Qing Zhu’s body went limp, almost falling to the ground.</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. He supported Qing Zhu and suddenly smelled a pungent metallic scent. He realized Qing Zhu was covered in blood.</p><p>Earlier, Qing Zhu had been holding back in front of Ling Zhuzi and the others to avoid revealing his condition.</p><p>“It’s nothing.”</p><p>Qing Zhu grasped Qin Sang’s arm, his voice weak but his tone still calm and steady. He said in a low voice, “To the Netherworld Valley!”</p><p>“Senior, your body…”</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with worry. Qing Zhu’s breath was unusually weak, and his life force was rapidly fading.</p><p>He immediately took out the San Guang Jade Liquid to give to Qing Zhu, but Qing Zhu stopped him.</p><p>“My essence is riddled with holes… don’t waste such a divine elixir on me.”</p><p>But he couldn't stop Qin Sang.</p><p>Qing Zhu no longer resisted, sighing softly, “Very well… I still have one last wish, and it concerns you.”</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Soul-Nurturing Wood Plaque.</p><p>“Senior, try this…”</p><p>Qing Zhu was surprised. He laughed, “You’re quite the treasure-laden Daoist. I remember your life-bound spirit sword chose a wood-elemental spirit object. No wonder you could cultivate to this level. You have the Soul-Nurturing Wood; you truly have profound good fortune…”</p><p>Qin Sang saw that Qing Zhu misunderstood that he had cultivated the *Chapter on Cultivating the Spirit Sword with the Soul* thanks to the Soul-Nurturing Wood, so he let it be and didn't explain.</p><p>“I drew the sword intent into my body. The demonic soul and the ancient demon’s split soul were destroyed, but my own essence was shattered by the sword energy. My soul is about to extinguish; only fragments of my spirit sword are keeping me alive. It's beyond saving. The Soul-Nurturing Wood can’t change anything, it can only allow me to linger a little longer…”</p><p>The San Guang Jade Liquid nourished his body, and the Soul-Nurturing Wood’s soul light nourished his remaining soul. Qing Zhu’s complexion improved slightly.</p><p>But as he said, it was beyond saving; it was merely a last flicker.</p><p>When Qing Zhu drew the sword intent into his body, Qin Sang had a premonition, but he didn't expect that even the Soul-Nurturing Wood couldn't save Qing Zhu.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly asked Bai, but Bai couldn't help either.</p><p>“He’s different from me. I definitely made preparations back then, allowing me to persist with a wisp of my remnant soul. His essence was shattered by the sword intent, fragmented, and even his remnant soul can’t coalesce. If it weren't for that fragment, he would have perished on the spot…”</p><p>Bai was also affected by the demonic howl.</p><p>Fortunately, he protected Ya Gu in time, and they only needed to rest for a while to recover.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes darkened.</p><p>This was his second encounter with Senior Qing Zhu, but he had admired him since joining Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Seeing Qing Zhu’s decisive self-sacrifice by drawing the sword intent into himself, Qin Sang knew he hadn't been wrong about him. If he could save Qing Zhu, he would do everything in his power.</p><p>“You must have many questions.”</p><p>They flew side-by-side towards the summit of Yitian Peak.</p><p>Qing Zhu looked up at the Hall of Sword Qi under the glow of the sunset, his thoughts flying back to his teleportation from the Ziwei Palace to the Seven Kills Hall, and his subsequent experiences in the Canglang Sea, which he recounted to Qin Sang.</p><p>It was all inextricably linked to Qin Sang, solving many of his mysteries.</p><p>“My teleportation to the Seven Kills Hall was the first time it appeared. The second time, you were teleported here, and the third time is now.”</p><p>Qing Zhu gazed into the depths of the sunset glow and said softly.</p><p>“Years ago, my junior sister and I plotted to assassinate Leng Yuntian in the Ziwei Palace to avenge our senior sister, but Leng Qian saw through our plan, only managing to severely injure Leng Yuntian.</p><p>"I was pursued by Leng Qian and, fearing for my junior sister's safety, I used a teleportation array to escape after being injured," he said, gesturing towards the top of the celestial barrier.  "The ancient teleportation array is located above the celestial barrier, where the inner and outer halls meet. I followed the white jade corridor to find the exit below, and made some arrangements to conceal the true passage. Remember this route; this talisman will allow you to return."</p><p>He showed Qin Sang the route and gave her a talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately memorized the route, relieved to finally know the location of the ancient teleportation array and the way back to Xiao Han domain.</p><p>"Thank you for your help, senior."</p><p>Qing Zhu smiled slightly. "You don't need to thank me. If I hadn't come here first, you would have been the first to discover the secret of the celestial barrier, and wouldn't have gone through so much trouble."</p><p>Qin Sang listened attentively.</p><p>"I teleported here, from the celestial barrier to the Nether Valley…"</p><p>Qing Zhu paused, then asked, "Do you know the origin of the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* and this fragment?"</p><p>"I heard that the cultivation technique seems to be from Zi Wei Palace. I didn't know about the fragment's existence before."</p><p>Qin Sang thought carefully; she had never heard of any fragment.</p><p>The spiritual sword fragment was indeed related to the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*.</p><p>This surprised Qing Zhu.  "You're the one with the highest cultivation of the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* after me, right? And unlike me, you don't have the lingering resentment. When did Dong Yang Bo become so blind?"</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Qin Sang felt ashamed, hesitated for a moment, and didn't hide anything from Qing Zhu. She briefly explained her entanglement with Chen Yan and Dong Yang Bo's schemes against her.</p><p>Qing Zhu chuckled. "I don't harbor ill feelings toward Dong Yang Bo. Back then, Leng Qian was at the height of his power, and my cultivation path was difficult. Anyone else would have done the same; they wouldn't offend the Yuan Shen sect for a single disciple. However, Dong Yang Bo always aims to revitalize Shao Hua Mountain. I wonder what his expression would be if he knew he had driven away a talented disciple who had the potential to become a Nascent Soul cultivator…"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt embarrassed and repeatedly said she didn't dare to imagine.</p><p>If she was considered a genius, then other cultivators were heavenly beings.</p><p>"Don't belittle yourself! I see you have ample vital energy and spirit, and you're practicing both body and spirit cultivation. You also possess Soul-Nourishing Wood and have taken Cleansing Soul Liquid. You have a better chance than others to form a Nascent Soul and will certainly have the opportunity to stand before Dong Yang Bo with honor in the future."</p><p>Qing Zhu seemed quite eager to see that scene.</p><p>"Body and spirit cultivation helps with forming a Nascent Soul?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up, and she quickly asked Qing Zhu for guidance.</p><p>This was the first time she had received guidance from a Nascent Soul ancestor.</p>
