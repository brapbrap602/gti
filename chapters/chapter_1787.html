<h1>Chapter 1778: The Divine Thunder Seal</h1><p>“No wonder cultivators in this realm are so skilled in talismanic arts; they start interacting with divine talismans from the very beginning of their cultivation journey…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused silently, filled with wonder.</p><p>The so-called Dharma Altar is supported by a divine talisman.  Each Dharma Altar corresponds to a different talisman, and the one Qin Sang now possesses is called the Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman! This talisman is the fundamental essence of the Dharma Altar and the foundation upon which it's built.  After receiving the Dharma Altar's inheritance, disciples of the Left Thunder Mansion gradually comprehend this talisman as their cultivation deepens, perfecting the altar over time.</p><p>The Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman is exceptionally complex.  Such intricate talismans are composed of multiple符形  assembled according to specific procedures. These components of the talisman are known as 散形 . Each dispersed form, when drawn, has unique patterns, divine characters, structure, spiritual apertures, and incantations, none of which can be wrong.  Some dispersed forms are themselves talismans. Only when all the dispersed forms are assembled into a whole does the complete talisman form, a step called 聚形  or 合形  – unification or integration.</p><p>Learning talismanic arts begins with understanding how to read talismans:  deconstructing each dispersed form from the whole symbolic form, comprehending each dispersed form, and then recombining them into the complex unified form, only then can one truly master it.</p><p>The structural forms of talismans vary greatly. Simpler ones combine several dispersed forms on the same plane, making the structure easy to discern. However, complex, large talismans are formed from dispersed forms that overlap and accumulate layer upon layer, making the individual forms invisible.  This requires cultivators to expend considerable mental energy in gradual comprehension – a task achievable only by those with unwavering perseverance and profound skill.</p><p>And that's just the beginning.  The ability to simplify and skillfully manipulate talismans is a profound art in itself.</p><p>The Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman is one such complex, large talisman—at least for Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment cultivators.  However, the Dharma Altar's inheritance has clearly deconstructed the talismanic form; otherwise, newly initiated disciples wouldn't even be able to discern the dispersed forms, let alone construct the altar.</p><p>During the construction of the altar, the talismanic form can be seen as the framework of the altar.  Once a cultivator understands the first dispersed form of the Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman, they can begin constructing the altar. It's like building a house: the first dispersed form is laying the foundation, followed by adding bricks and tiles layer by layer, gradually building a solid Dharma Altar.</p><p>Before this, Qin Sang hadn't dedicated himself to talismanic arts and rarely had the chance to draw talismans himself, but he had used spirit talismans frequently and had some understanding of their essence. Moreover, the Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman isn't exceptionally profound; even if he knew nothing about talismanic arts, comprehending it wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Without any effort, Qin Sang grasped the first dispersed form. He opened his eyes, pondered for a moment, and raised a finger, lightly moving it.  Spiritual light emanated from his fingertip, leaving a radiant trail in the void—the first dispersed form was complete.</p><p>Looking at this dispersed form, Qin Sang fell into contemplation. The form hung in mid-air, its spiritual light flowing like water, with faint flashes of thunder faintly visible, resembling a mysterious rune.</p><p>There's a method to drawing talismans, just as there are characters in writing.  In talismanic arts, there are special runes.  Runes are like words, dispersed forms are paragraphs, and the unified form is the whole text. One dispersed form might be a single special rune or countless runes combined. Runes originate from cultivators' profound understanding of Heaven and Earth, observing all things, drawing inspiration from the patterns of clouds, stars, and mimicking insect and bird script, etc.</p><p>Based on their function and origin,符修  classify runes into categories such as Divine Mansion Jade Script, Qiong Palace Spirit Script, Cloud Seal Thunder Mark, Dragon Glory Phoenix Seal, and many more.  Various runes can form talismans individually or combine to create different talismans with different powers.</p><p>The dispersed form before Qin Sang was composed of Thunder Marks.  The high and lofty Divine Thunder Mansion worships the Thunder God and cultivates thunder techniques, so the Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman is primarily composed of Thunder Marks.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to a special aperture within the dispersed form—another crucial aspect of talismans: the spiritual aperture!</p><p>There’s a saying:</p><p>“Draw a talisman without knowing the aperture, and you'll only make the spirits laugh. Draw a talisman knowing the aperture, and you'll make the spirits shriek!”</p><p>This aperture is no ordinary aperture; Heaven and Earth combine to create it. It is called the Spirit Qi Point. Like the qi apertures in a human body, qi is distributed within it. When qi flows through the talismanic form, Heaven and Earth communicate, divine intent converges, and it acts as the talisman's core.</p><p>The combination of dispersed forms is not a simple superposition; apertures must be combined, spiritual apertures must be connected, and the flow of intent and qi must be unobstructed for it to become a talisman. The more complex the talisman, the more spiritual apertures it has.</p><p>The first dispersed form of the Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman has only one spiritual aperture—the aperture Qin Sang is looking at. After the Dharma Altar is built, the Dharma Altar's inheritance resides in this aperture; subsequent aperture combinations will use this aperture as the foundation.</p><p>Qin Sang moved his mind slightly, and several streams of light flew out of the Qianjun Ring and landed in front of him. Among them were two bottles of golden blood, one gleaming brightly, the other slightly duller; a piece of dead wood continuously emitting blue thunder; and a spirit herb with leaves patterned like thunderbolts.  The wood was the root of a Qingxiao tree, and the herb is called the Ying Lei Grass.</p><p>Two vials of blood were collected by Qin Sang while he was working for the Left Mansion in the Leiying Demon Kingdom. Both vials contain Golden-winged Thunder Eagle blood; one from a royal, the other from a common bird.</p><p>Four spiritual objects were prepared for the altar construction.</p><p>The Golden Seal Altar and the Military Altar, one real, one illusory.</p><p>The Military Altar needs to unify and connect the Qi of the subordinate troops to jointly form a talisman shape. With higher cultivation, it allows commanders to reside in other spiritual apertures.</p><p>The Golden Seal Altar refines spiritual objects to build the talisman shape.</p><p>The grade of spiritual objects used in altar construction will affect the altar and the divine talismans, but higher isn't always better.</p><p>For a mere first dispersed shape, using extremely high-grade spiritual objects with overly powerful energy may damage the spiritual aperture, causing the talisman shape to collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over the four spiritual objects.  He first tried a drop of the royal Golden-winged Thunder Eagle blood, failing as expected.  </p><p>He didn't force it, instead taking a drop of common blood and suspending it above his palm.</p><p>Newly initiated cultivators lack the ability to refine spiritual objects.  As long as they can use impure blood or medicinal power to construct the altar and prevent its collapse, they can refine it later.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally didn't need to do this. With a slight use of True Energy, he purified the blood, retaining only the purest bloodline power.</p><p>Only a tiny amount of pure bloodline thunder power remained.  Qin Sang flicked it into the dispersed shape.</p><p>Visible to the naked eye, a point of thunder light moved between the dispersed shape, the thunder power as ink, sketching thunder patterns in one go!</p><p>The dispersed shape transformed into a thunder talisman, its spiritual light pulsating in resonance with the spiritual aperture.</p><p>Qin Sang moved his mind, his Dharma entering the aperture.</p><p>In an instant, the altar was formed!</p><p>"This is my altar."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the altar.</p><p>The altar is three-tiered, with four pillars symbolizing Heaven, Earth, Sun, and Moon, and eight gates and ten directions. It's consistent with the altars he'd seen before.</p><p>Being a Golden Seal Altar, it’s less grand than the Military Altars of the Dao Court officials.</p><p>Because only one dispersed shape was completed, the altar appears as a blurry shadow. Inside the shadow, several threads of lightning intertwine, forming the altar's framework around the central spiritual aperture.</p><p>Within the aperture, a seal floats.</p><p>The seal reads: Supreme Upper God霄!</p><p>The seal is the Dharma's true form—the renowned God霄 Thunder Seal of Mount Ju!</p><p>Qin Sang put away the altar, carefully contemplating it.  He suddenly opened his palm, and a talisman shadow flashed.</p><p>A thunderclap shook the ground, and a thunderbolt struck a corner of the cave.</p><p>It was night, and the outside was unusually quiet.</p><p>Qin Sang had concealed the sound and power of the thunder, avoiding alarming the outside cultivators.</p><p>He had just used the Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman from his Dharma.</p><p>Due to the Dharma's unique nature, cultivators can use the corresponding divine talisman after constructing the first dispersed shape.</p><p>Initially, the power is weak, gradually increasing as the altar is built.</p><p>Most importantly, using this talisman is like using one's own divine ability; it forms with a thought, and the power of the talisman is at the cultivator’s fingertips.</p><p>The thunderbolt Qin Sang just unleashed was the Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman, created with a pointed finger.</p><p>Spiritual aperture, dispersed shape, gathered shape—not a single step can be wrong.</p><p>Although the divine talisman's power is strong, drawing it is extremely tedious, especially complex large talismans.  It can’t be done in one go. While dueling, drawing a talisman would waste precious time and give an enemy an advantage.</p><p>Therefore, cultivators seek ways to shorten the time.</p><p>The most common method is using special spiritual objects to make talisman paper, brushes, and cinnabar, pre-preparing talismans for use in battle.</p><p>Some create talisman disks and other talisman artifacts; the talisman disks used by Su Zinan and Old Wu were of this type.</p><p>Some exceptionally talented individuals have profound understanding of talismanry, simplifying a specific divine talisman to its essence, allowing them to create talismans with a pointed finger.</p><p>These geniuses are few, and most divine talismans are used for combat, requiring immense effort and proving inefficient.</p><p>This world’s flourishing talismanry is not just due to complete inheritance; it's because altars allow ordinary cultivators to create talismans instantly.</p><p>Cultivators of the Thunder Jade Mansion all practice the Supreme Upper God霄 Dharma and know the Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman—their most used and convenient talisman because it's instantaneous.</p><p>To a certain extent, the Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman can be considered their innate true talisman, and they will obtain even stronger talismans upon ascension.</p><p>The altar's function doesn't end there.</p><p>Other divine talismans, besides the innate true talisman, gradually form a divine talisman imprint within the altar as they are understood.</p><p>When using the talisman, simply activating the imprint creates the talisman, saving cultivators significant time and effort.</p><p>Even for yet-unmastered talismans, the altar increases the success rate, shortens casting time, and reduces the consumption of spiritual awareness and True Energy.</p><p>In duels, victory can be decided in an instant.</p><p>If they are both Thunder Department talismans, the altar enhances their power, yielding untold benefits.</p><p>The mastery of thunder techniques at the Jade Thunder Palace in Jushan is unparalleled.  Undoubtedly, they possess a corresponding lineage of thunder deity talismans.  Contemplation within a ritual altar would greatly aid understanding, but unfortunately, this knowledge cannot be granted to an outsider.</p><p>Qin Sang isn't particularly interested in these talismans; his priority is restoring his cultivation.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang begins to recall the "Morning True Jade Talisman Incantation," preparing for meditative visualization.</p><p>“True Sky, True Mandate, Grand Decree from the Nine Heavens.  I receive your command, and behold your brilliance…  Above, the Celestial Sky, I turn to the Precious Throne…”</p><p>Incantations flood Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>According to Daoist practices for meditative visualization, before the main practice, one should recite the “Pure Heart Incantation,” the foremost of the eight great incantations, to purify the body and mind, dispel distracting thoughts, and calm the spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't need such formalities; this isn't his first visualization.</p><p>During the initial stages of practicing "Heavenly Demon Body Refinement," visualizing the mythical creature Qingluan was a form of meditative visualization.</p><p>Now, he stills his mind, activates the "Morning True Jade Talisman Incantation," and visualizes not a celestial deity, but his inner divinity.</p><p>Quietly contemplating the truth, inwardly observing his form and shadow.</p><p>Visualizing my divinity, contemplating my body.</p><p>While visualizing a celestial deity might take time, visualizing inner divinity quickly produces a response.</p><p>Daoist lore speaks of thirty-six thousand divinities within the human body.</p><p>Subtly, Qin Sang feels a trace of divine intent arising in his heart, rising and falling with his thoughts, ethereal and mysterious, seemingly drawn towards the altar, settling within the ritual array, using the array as its dwelling place.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang awakens, discovering that the divine intent remains, not dissipating due to his wandering thoughts.</p><p>“Is this the altar-protecting deity?”</p><p>Qin Sang muses, feeling a sense of wonder.</p><p>In truth, visualizing a celestial deity doesn't actually bring the deity down from the heavens; what is visualized is a subtle, mysterious divine intent.</p><p>The so-called altar-protecting deity is, in essence, divine intent residing within the altar, unable to truly manifest its power; otherwise, there wouldn't be so much skepticism surrounding Daoist legends.</p><p>However, with increasing cultivation and daily visualization, cultivators can feel the divine intent gradually grow stronger.</p><p>This divine intent protects the cultivator's consciousness, preventing confusion.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully experiences this, focusing on the inner nature of the divine intent.  Though not entirely clear, he senses a faint fluctuation from the Jade Buddha.</p><p>Like his soul imprint, it’s imbued with the Jade Buddha's power, its potency surely significantly different.</p><p>Qin Sang nods silently.</p><p>Next, he hesitates no longer and repeats the altar construction countless times.</p><p>Wave after wave of dispersed energy continually merges into the altar.  Others witnessing Qin Sang's speed of altar construction would be dumbfounded.</p><p>Having used up ordinary blood essence, Qin Sang uses imperial blood essence. The altar nears completion, barely usable.</p><p>Soon, the altar is finished!</p><p>Now, the altar radiates far greater power than before. Within it, the Divine Sky Thunder Seal slowly rotates.</p><p>The seal appears to be composed of lightning, completely clear.</p><p>Lightning surrounds the seal, weaving into a complex web.  These lightning bolts seem alive, their electric glow flickering; with a slight thought from Qin Sang, thunder sparks and lightning vanishes.</p><p>Everything occurs silently; this lightning is the manifestation of talismans, unable to leave the altar.</p><p>Having refined the Supreme Upper One Child Official General to the extreme, Qin Sang feels no fatigue.</p><p>As for the divine intent within the ritual array, its growth isn't as fast; Qin Sang needs to continuously practice meditative visualization for some time, though it won't take long given his cultivation.</p><p>He silently cultivates, his energy sea rotates, inhaling and exhaling the world's vital energy, refining it into his body, maintaining his true essence at the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Without needing to suppress it with spiritual sense, his true essence shows no signs of chaos, but before advancing to higher-level ritual arrays, the total amount of true essence and the speed of absorbing vital energy have limits.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang discovers another powerful function of the altar: it can aid cultivators in their practice, increasing their cultivation speed!</p><p>He thinks to himself, no wonder cultivators in this world, from the moment they begin their path, must devote themselves to understanding talismans and visualizing celestial deities, all of which consume time and energy.</p><p>Even with the abundant vital energy of this world, it's exceedingly difficult; the altar alleviates a significant burden on cultivators.</p><p>He’s plotted so much for the qualification of the assignment; yet the altar construction is so simple.</p><p>Qin Sang shakes his head slightly, stands up, and pushes open the door.</p><p>The outside sky is still dark.  He glances at the time, his figure flickers, and he departs.</p><p>Next, it's time to obtain the Flowing Gold Fire Bell talisman from the Thunder Right Palace.</p><p>Not long after leaving the island, Qin Sang uses his flying technique towards Pot Island, preparing to visit Master Qi first.</p><p></p>
