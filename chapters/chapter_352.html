<h1>Chapter 345: The Eccentric</h1><p>The world of cultivation is a brutal one, survival of the fittest.</p><p>Only those who reach the Foundation Establishment stage can truly stand on their own two feet and protect themselves during outdoor trials.</p><p>Tan Hao's inability to break through to Foundation Establishment meant everything was uncertain.</p><p>Otherwise, the more likely outcome was that Tan Hao would die before he could save Tan Jie.</p><p>All this effort would be in vain.</p><p>Qin Sang merely hoped that the Wandering Taoist could offer some guidance to Tan Hao.  His own breakthrough to Foundation Establishment was due to the Danlong Ginseng and the Sect Leader's personal protection; he was unsure how to guide Tan Hao.</p><p>He hadn't expected the Wandering Taoist to be so generous, directly gifting a Biying Pill.</p><p>Tan Hao, a strong man, felt overwhelmed looking at the two spirit pills before him.</p><p>He couldn’t bear to refuse them.</p><p>But accepting them without any recompense felt impossible.</p><p>At this moment, only four words echoed in Tan Hao's mind: "How could I deserve this?"</p><p>Which cultivator, especially a wandering one, could ever hope to obtain a Foundation Establishment Pill?</p><p>Not every disciple in a cultivation sect possesses one.</p><p>Furthermore, Tan Hao had spent most of his savings treating Tan Jie, leaving him virtually destitute.</p><p>Tan Hao knew that even if he sold everything he owned, he wouldn't be able to afford these two spirit pills. He couldn't figure out how he could repay this kindness to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Take them!"</p><p>The Wandering Taoist pressed the Biying Pills firmly into Tan Hao's palm, his voice filled with emotion.</p><p>"I was deeply moved when Qin's younger brother told me about your righteous act. Even without Qin's intervention, I would have been willing to help.</p><p>"I can't fully understand the bond between you brothers.</p><p>"But your unwavering devotion for decades shows the immense power contained within that familial love.</p><p>"The Biying Pill is not a precious item, far less valuable than a Foundation Establishment Pill. Moreover, I'm not giving this to you for nothing.  Your experiences have given me pause for thought, and I've had a glimpse of enlightenment.</p><p>"Perhaps this experience will help me further my Dao. Consider this pill payment for that insight!"</p><p>Qin Sang shoved the Foundation Establishment Pill into Tan Hao's hand as well, pointing towards the crystal coffin.  "Don't only think of yourself. Think of Tan Jie, think of your unwavering dedication. If you can't reach Foundation Establishment, you'll spend your life cooped up in a cave. How will you travel the world? How will you cure Tan Jie? Do you want him to remain half-dead in that coffin for the rest of his life?"</p><p>The Wandering Taoist chimed in.</p><p>"Qin's younger brother is right.  We admire that about you, and that's why we are willing to help.</p><p>"Consider this a chance, an opportunity earned through your decades of hardship and perseverance.</p><p>"Speaking of unwavering dedication, I'll share some of my own understanding, which helped me greatly during my Foundation Establishment breakthrough. Consider this advice.</p><p>"Some say cultivation is about achieving freedom and tranquility, requiring a refined mind. If one’s dedication is an obstacle they can't overcome, they will be plagued by inner demons. Being stuck at a bottleneck is the least of the concerns; the far greater danger is the proliferation of inner demons, leading to going astray.</p><p>"But everyone's path is unique; how can we compare them?</p><p>"In my view, unwavering dedication isn't necessarily a bad thing.</p><p>"It was my unwavering dedication that allowed me to persevere, facing all hardships without fear, and steadfastly pursuing my path.</p><p>"Your experiences are complex, and you should have similar insights.</p><p>"Before attempting Foundation Establishment, reflect on your past.  Whether you choose to let go or strengthen your resolve, it will be a unique understanding of your own.</p><p>"It might even help you achieve Foundation Establishment."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered after hearing the Wandering Taoist's words.</p><p>The Wandering Taoist spoke to Tan Hao, but perhaps he was also speaking to himself.</p><p>Tan Hao seemed to have grasped something, lost in thought.</p><p>The Wandering Taoist walked to the crystal coffin, observing Tan Jie's condition. He let out a soft "hmm," leaned closer for a moment, a look of surprise flashing in his eyes before glancing at Tan Hao without saying anything.</p><p>That night.</p><p>Qin Sang was cultivating when he sensed the activation of a restriction. It was the Wandering Taoist.</p><p>"Did I disturb your cultivation, Qin?"</p><p>"Senior, please come in…"</p><p>Qin Sang invited the Wandering Taoist inside, somewhat puzzled about the late-night visit.</p><p>The Wandering Taoist entered and got straight to the point. "Qin, I want to ask you about the unique technique used to seal Tan Jie…"</p><p>"Are you interested, Senior?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought the Wandering Taoist might have noticed something.</p><p>He wasn't alarmed; the Demonic Sect's corpse-refining technique wasn't rare. The explanation was also easy; he could claim he acquired it from a demonic cultivator.</p><p>He'd been careful before to avoid trouble.</p><p>Corpse-refining was just a tool, and his aim was to save a life.  As long as he didn’t flagrantly use it to harm people like demonic cultivators, the righteous path wouldn’t exterminate him for knowing such a technique.</p><p>The Wandering Taoist shook his head.</p><p>The Daoist felt a familiar aura about Daoist Tan Jie, very similar to a strange person he'd encountered before. He suspected it might be connected to Qin Sang's unique skill.</p><p>"I know of a place that may contain herbs to heal soul injuries.  It's extremely dangerous, though. I planned to wait until at least the late Foundation Establishment stage before venturing there.</p><p>"A large part of that was because of this strange person.</p><p>"If Qin Sang has a way to deal with that person, I'm ready to go now. If successful, it would save me a lot of work before the Golden Core stage."</p><p>"Strange person?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.  The aura sensed by Yunyouzi was likely the change in Tan Jie's primordial spirit after merging with the Sky Corpse Talisman.  Had Yunyouzi encountered a corpse animated by such a talisman before?</p><p>Why call it a "strange person"?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't plan to focus on the *Tian Yin Corpse Manual*, intending to use corpse refinement only as a combat technique. However, he was very interested in some of its secrets, especially the method for enhancing corpses into Flying Night Rakshasas.</p><p>A Flying Night Rakshasa is equivalent to a Golden Core cultivator in strength.</p><p>Perhaps not as powerful as a true Golden Core cultivator, but certainly stronger than Foundation Establishment cultivators.  Creating one would let him dominate at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Remarkably, the *Tian Yin Corpse Manual* doesn't require a Golden Core corpse to create a Flying Night Rakshasa; it can be upgraded from an animated corpse.</p><p>Unfortunately, he only has the incomplete first half of the *Tian Yin Corpse Manual*.</p><p>After returning from the Sky Corpse Cave, Qin Sang investigated the Sky Corpse Sect. He found it to be relatively obscure, rarely mentioned because their corpse refinement technique used earth-sha spirit energy, unlike other methods.</p><p>The scant records in ancient texts were vague and incomplete.</p><p>This suggests the Sky Corpse Sect was either weak or short-lived; in short, insignificant.</p><p>Unable to find clues to the second half of the *Tian Yin Corpse Manual*, Qin Sang eventually gave up.</p><p>If Yunyouzi's "strange person" is a corpse, it might be related to the Sky Corpse Sect.</p><p>This piqued Qin Sang's interest.</p><p>"Senior, please tell me more. What kind of strange person is it?"</p>
