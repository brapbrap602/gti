<h1>Chapter 1395: The Tide-Summoning Horseshoe Crab</h1><p>“Could someone have improved upon the ancient Wu techniques, resolving their inherent flaws, thus enabling human cultivation?”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>He had obtained his soul-bound insect Gu soon after forming his Golden Core, and now he had even cultivated four-stage Sky-Eyed Butterflies, demonstrating his considerable skill.</p><p>But if he were to attempt such modification himself, he would be at a complete loss.</p><p>The secret techniques of soul-bound insect Gu were an ancient Wu inheritance, intricately interwoven; alterations were not easily made.</p><p>Unless one possessed an extremely deep understanding of this path, even a prodigious talent would not be able to achieve it.</p><p>Lan Jingsi and Feng Shangshi chatted amicably.</p><p>Qin Sang followed silently behind.</p><p>Soon, a mountain peak appeared before them.</p><p>Lan Jingsi gently raised her hand, forming a hand seal. The mountain peak suddenly twisted, revealing itself to be an illusion concealing something else within.</p><p>This was the location of the Hundred Flowers Valley's entrance.</p><p>“Please, fellow cultivators,”</p><p>Lan Jingsi gestured invitingly.</p><p>Flying into Hundred Flowers Valley, a rich floral fragrance filled the air, intoxicating them.</p><p>The name Hundred Flowers Valley was well-deserved; the entire valley was carpeted with colorful flowers, a vibrant tapestry. Among them were many spiritual flowers, standing tall and elegant, exuding unique aromas.</p><p>Some disciples of Hundred Flowers Valley moved through the flowers, occasionally startling a small insect from the foliage.</p><p>The insects showed no fear, circling them playfully before disappearing back into the flowers.</p><p>Crystal Ants, Green-backed Mantises, Triangle King Insects…</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes darted around; in just a short time, he had spotted more than a dozen types of spiritual insects.</p><p>While not of the extraordinary insect level, they were all rare spiritual insects seldom seen in the outside world, each possessing unique innate abilities.</p><p>It seemed these insects were raised by Hundred Flowers Valley – a truly impressive feat.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley held not only flower fields but also various terrains suitable for diverse insects, including venomous ones.</p><p>It might be more appropriately named Insect Valley.</p><p>The three eventually arrived at a lakeside bamboo pavilion.</p><p>Lan Jingsi had attendants serve them flower tea.</p><p>After a while of casual conversation, Feng Shangshi mentioned the recent war between the two clans, showering Qin Sang with praise.</p><p>Lan Jingsi seemed to believe him and became increasingly respectful towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Feng Shangshi complimented the fragrant tea and exchanged a glance with Qin Sang.  He then put down his cup and asked, “I wonder where Daoist Mu is now?”</p><p>Lan Jingsi did not hide the truth. “My senior brother was invited by a fellow cultivator to the Boundless Sea.”</p><p>“The Boundless Sea?”</p><p>Feng Shangshi paused, surprised.  “Your sect's founder also came from the Boundless Sea…”</p><p>“Senior brother even told you this? That’s right. Although he left the Boundless Sea, many old friends remain there. The one who invited him is a descendant of an old friend of our founder. It’s a significant matter, and he cannot leave until it’s resolved.”</p><p>Lan Jingsi explained seriously, but did not reveal Master Mu’s true whereabouts.</p><p>Feng Shangshi didn’t press further.  Looking at Qin Sang, he explained his purpose, “To be frank, Daoist Feng owes Daoist Mingyue a favor. I promised to introduce Daoist Mingyue to Daoist Mu, requesting Daoist Mu’s guidance in the art of insect control.”</p><p>Lan Jingsi seemed to have anticipated this and showed no surprise. She turned to Qin Sang, “Daoist Mingyue is also skilled in insect control?”</p><p>“I wouldn't dare claim expertise in Hundred Flowers Valley,” Qin Sang humbly replied, “I am very interested in the art of insect control, and have tried to cultivate several kinds, but the results have been unsatisfactory.”</p><p>Speaking of insect control, Lan Jingsi also became very interested, and began exchanging ideas with Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had immersed himself in this art for many years. Even concealing the parts related to the Wu clan, his insightful words often made Lan Jingsi contemplate.</p><p>Lan Jingsi reciprocated his interest, reinforcing Qin Sang's belief that Hundred Flowers Valley’s heritage was extraordinary.</p><p>Feng Shangshi, unable to interject, listened with great interest, finding the conversation far from dull.</p><p>When the conversation turned to Qin Sang's most valued insect, Lan Jingsi eagerly said, “May I have a look?”</p><p>Qin Sang opened his spirit beast pouch and summoned the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Before clarifying Hundred Flowers Valley's background, Qin Sang couldn't reveal the fact that he possessed a soul-bound insect Gu.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was Ya Gu's insect.</p><p>He could only use the Fire Jade Centipede for show.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was about to break through to the late third stage, a remarkable achievement in the cultivation world.</p><p>“A Fire Jade Centipede!”</p><p>Lan Jingsi’s eyes flashed with surprise. “Such a rare treasure-finding insect! Among spiritual insects, the Fire Jade Centipede has one of the highest advancement difficulties.  To see a three-stage Fire Jade Centipede in this day and age is unexpected! No wonder you care so much for it!”</p><p>She clearly understood insect control, immediately identifying the Fire Jade Centipede's unique traits.</p><p>"Daoist Lan is incredibly knowledgeable; I am in awe," Qin Sang said with a bow of respect. "I'm sure you've sensed my predicament. I can cultivate it to the late third transformation stage, but I'm unsure how to help it advance further."</p><p>This was a probing question regarding the fire jade centipede.</p><p>Qin Sang's aim was to gauge the extent of Baihua Valley's knowledge.</p><p>Baihua Valley had two Yuan Ying masters, its leader also being a mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator, and had close ties with Master Feng.</p><p>Ideally, he hoped to obtain what he needed through an exchange.  Unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang wanted to avoid other means.</p><p>Pausing, Qin Sang continued, "I hear Daoist Mu possesses a fourth-transformation tide-summoning horseshoe crab. Perhaps they could offer some guidance?"</p><p>That Mu, the valley master, possessed a fourth-transformation spirit insect wasn't a secret among Yuan Ying cultivators, but Qin Sang hadn't expected it to be his lifebound insect.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Lan Jingsi looked troubled. "My senior brother only succeeded by chance, and it's related to his unique cultivation technique. It's difficult for outsiders to replicate. Furthermore, it's a secret, and I can't reveal it without his permission."</p><p>Master Feng suggested, "Bad timing.  Perhaps you could visit again when Daoist Mu returns to the valley?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  Improving the fire jade centipede wasn't urgent; Baihua Valley wasn't going anywhere, he could always return.</p><p>It might be better to search the Boundless Sea for Jing Lake in the meantime and see if he could find anything related to the Witch Tribe before making further decisions.</p><p>Qin Sang had a plan, about to speak, when Lan Jingsi hesitated, saying, "If Daoist Mingyue has no pressing matters, perhaps you could stay in the valley for a while? I'll try to contact my senior brother; he can decide."</p><p>Master Feng rejoiced, "It would be wonderful to contact Daoist Mu!"</p><p>Qin Sang covertly observed Lan Jingsi, his eyes flashing. After considering his options, he decided to change his plan, nodding. "Then I shall impose on you for a while. Thank you, Daoist Lan."</p><p>The three continued their tea and discussion.</p><p>An hour later, Master Feng, eager to visit an old friend, took his leave. Qin Sang and Lan Jingsi, despite their attempts to persuade him to stay, saw him out of the valley.</p><p>After that, Qin Sang remained in Baihua Valley.</p><p>Lan Jingsi settled Qin Sang in a peaceful bamboo building.</p><p>Perhaps due to Master Feng's recommendations, Baihua Valley outwardly showed little suspicion towards Qin Sang.</p><p>He was free to move about the valley and, with permission, access the first floor of the Baihua Valley scripture library to peruse some texts.</p><p>For over ten days, Lan Jingsi didn't appear, and Qin Sang had no idea how she was contacting Valley Master Mu.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to play the long game, not rushing things.</p><p>During this time, his understanding of Baihua Valley deepened.</p><p>Even without obtaining Baihua Valley's secret cultivation techniques, Qin Sang was certain of their connection to the Witch Tribe!</p>
