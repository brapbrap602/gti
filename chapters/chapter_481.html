<h1>Chapter 474: A Self-Created Cultivation Technique</h1><p>A sphere of lightning, suspended by spiritual energy, floated towards Qin Sang.  He eyed it, resisting the temptation to reach out, and instead looked inquiringly at Granny Jing.</p><p>"I didn't intend to involve you in this.  Fate is fickle; it just so happened they stumbled in..." Granny Jing said calmly, her gaze sweeping over the lightning sphere. "This is your spoils of war, rightfully yours. It's quite a potent artifact, capable of severely injuring mid-Core Formation cultivators, and even late-Core Formation cultivators must treat it with caution.  Of course, that's assuming you can hit your target; its area of effect isn't very large…"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced down at the stone platform beneath his feet. The runes on it were identical to those on the other platform, only reversed. The portal on this platform was now closed, the runes dormant. Everything appeared normal, yet he wasn't sure if he could return.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Qin Sang said, "If it weren't for your intervention, Senior, I would have been swallowed by the spatial storm Elder Palmstar unleashed.  Moreover, you paid such a heavy price, with the divine beast, the Azure Phoenix, perishing…"</p><p>Granny Jing suddenly chuckled softly.  It was the first time Qin Sang had seen her smile. It didn't detract from her aura but rather added a touch of warmth, making her seem less aloof and distant.</p><p>Interrupting Qin Sang, Granny Jing extended her right hand, palm up. Spiritual energy surged in her hand, like waves rolling. When the surge subsided, a wooden carving of an Azure Phoenix appeared, identical to the previous one.</p><p>Accompanied by a phoenix's cry, the carving came to life, dancing gracefully around Granny Jing and chirping affectionately. Then, the phoenix playfully twisted its slender neck, spread its wings, and landed on Qin Sang's shoulder.  It preened its feathers and nuzzled its cheek against his face. Its azure feathers were fine and soft, like the finest silk.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not move. After the phoenix flew away, a soft, cool sensation lingered on his cheek.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's astonished gaze, Granny Jing smiled, pointed a delicate finger at the phoenix's head, and softly said, "She's taken a liking to you…"</p><p>Qin Sang was certain that the previous phoenix had been consumed by the spatial storm. Now, an identical one had appeared!</p><p>"Is it truly a puppet?"  Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel. "Your puppetry skills are truly lifelike, Senior. I've never seen anything like it!"</p><p>"It's not that my puppetry is so exquisite. I once had the good fortune to witness a true Azure Phoenix and experience its aura firsthand, though not a true divine beast."  Granny Jing explained, stroking the phoenix's elegant wings.  Her lips parted slightly as she softly said, "Go."</p><p>Although the phoenix's aura, like Qin Sang's, was suppressed to the Mortal Demon stage, its speed was still remarkable. In the blink of an eye, it flew towards the hall's exit.</p><p>Watching the phoenix disappear, Qin Sang reached out and grasped the lightning sphere. He bowed slightly and said, "Then I'll gratefully accept this, Senior."</p><p>"I said it was your spoils," Granny Jing nodded indifferently.  Then, her eyes flickered. "That was the Blood Defilement Divine Light just now, wasn't it? Given the nature of your cultivation technique, fusing the Infernal Bloodwood into your natal spirit sword is enough to elevate it to the level of a magic treasure. You're quite fortunate to have obtained one of the Ten Divine Woods. No wonder you've been so reluctant to use your natal spirit sword. Are you afraid I'll steal your treasure?"  She said this with a teasing smile, as if mocking Qin Sang's timidity.</p><p>Qin Sang had been mentally prepared, but his heart still tensed when Granny Jing mentioned the Ebony Sword. However, he hadn't expected her to say such a thing.</p><p>He couldn't help but ask, "Senior, are you familiar with the *Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture*?"</p><p>Granny Jing stood with her hands clasped behind her back, gazing out of the hall with a distant look in her eyes, lost in thought. After a moment of silence, she said softly, "I'm not only familiar with the *Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture* held by Mount Shaohua, but I also know that it's incomplete, containing only the first five levels, allowing cultivation only to the early stage of Core Formation…"</p><p>The *Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture* was a treasured cultivation technique of Mount Shaohua. Although disciples were not forbidden from studying it, those who hadn't cultivated it only knew the superficial aspects.  Granny Jing's words revealed a depth of understanding of the *Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture* that rivaled Qin Sang's own.  Only someone who had truly cultivated it to a high level could possess such knowledge!</p><p>What was Granny Jing's identity?  Could she have some connection to Mount Shaohua? Perhaps she herself had even cultivated the *Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture*!</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was reeling in shock, Granny Jing's gaze fell upon his face. "Do you want the subsequent levels of the *Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture*?"</p><p>Even with his resolute mind, Qin Sang's heart pounded at these words. Of course, he wanted the subsequent levels! This technique had transformed him, offering him a glimpse of the path to the Great Dao.  He couldn't imagine a more suitable cultivation technique for himself, but alas, it was incomplete.</p><p>Upon reaching the fifth level and hitting a dead end, Qin Sang had only two choices: either continue along the path of the *Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture* and create the subsequent levels himself, stumbling along the way, or switch to a different cultivation technique.</p><p>Creating his own continuation was unlikely. Qin Sang was self-aware about his talent. His success in cultivating the *Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture* thus far was entirely due to the Jade Buddha.  Even when comprehending the Killing Talismans, he had relied heavily on the Jade Buddha to stabilize his mind, shield him from the corrosive killing intent, and follow the established steps of the technique.</p><p>His understanding of cultivation techniques and the Killing Dao was far from sufficient to create his own, and this path was too difficult.  Switching to another technique would mean abandoning all his progress, losing not only his natal spirit sword but also the boost to his cultivation speed provided by the Killing Talismans.</p><p>Unless he could find another similar technique.  This choice was a hurdle no less significant than Core Formation itself.  However, Core Formation consumed so much of Qin Sang's energy that he had no time to consider what lay beyond.</p><p>"Senior, do you possess the latter half of the *Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture*?"  Qin Sang asked urgently, though doubts lingered in his mind.  He secretly speculated about Granny Jing's origins, quickly reviewing the prominent figures in Mount Shaohua's history to see if anyone matched her description. With her beauty and aura, she couldn't have been an unknown figure.</p><p>"Not the latter half, but a continuation," Granny Jing corrected, looking at Qin Sang.  "Created by another cultivator who practiced the *Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture*."</p><p>A self-created continuation! Qin Sang was stunned.  Many Mount Shaohua disciples had attempted to cultivate the *Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture* throughout the generations. Almost all of them had given up early on.  The agony of soul-devouring sword Qi and corrosive killing intent was unimaginable to outsiders.  These individuals certainly wouldn't have been capable of creating a continuation.</p>
