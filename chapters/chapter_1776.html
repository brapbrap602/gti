<h1>Chapter 1767: The Imperial Bell True Talisman</h1><p>The dark clouds, initially menacing and obscuring the sky, instantly coalesced into a single mass upon the appearance of the spirit sword, revealing the startled eyes of the black panther demon.  Even within the borders of Guifang, the black panther demon hadn't been reckless enough to defy the five-talisman masters.</p><p>Liu Hou was precisely worried that the Daoist court would dispatch masters to capture him; he had been hiding outside for years, afraid to even return to his own manor.</p><p>Facing the sword's edge, the black panther demon felt even greater pressure than Qin Sang. Its fur stood on end.  It felt as though only the sword existed in its field of vision, the rest of the world vanished.</p><p>Centered on the Daoist, the surrounding spiritual energy was being manipulated by the spirit sword.  The forest was filled with swirling winds, spiritual energy churned violently, and the sounds of wind and thunder were deafening.  Mountains at the edge of the forest trembled, and rivers surged with gigantic waves.</p><p>Brilliant multicolored bands and specks of light appeared in the void, summoned by the sword light, and surged toward it. These were the manifestations of the manipulated spiritual energy, visible to Qin Sang and the demon.</p><p>Even at his peak, Qin Sang could only barely manipulate a fraction of the spiritual energy, using its pressure to subdue opponents, but never control it.  This tactic was effective against lower-level cultivators but useless against those of the same level; he still relied on magic treasures and abilities to win.</p><p>The Daoist's display was astonishing. Qin Sang doubted even late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators could replicate it. Only scant mentions in ancient texts he'd read, detailing the abilities of Void Refinement cultivators, came close to explaining such a phenomenon.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>A violent wind raged across the land.  The dense spiritual energy continued to accumulate relentlessly, the sword light expanding at an alarming rate.  The attracted spiritual energy condensed into thick multicolored mist.</p><p>The sword light seemed to absorb the multicolored mist, and as the mist surged, a colossal five-colored sword, reaching towards the heavens, materialized. Its blade slightly slanted, its tip piercing the clouds, pointed directly at the demon.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of insignificance, as if this sword could easily crush him. He could only imagine the immense pressure the panther demon was under.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A five-colored sword light, brighter than lightning, suddenly pierced the heavens. The momentum of the sword was earth-shattering.  For a moment, it seemed as if the sky itself was cleaved by the light.</p><p>The black panther demon didn't even wait for the sword light to reach it, fleeing instantly. The dark cloud retreated with even greater speed than it had arrived.  It had no intention of confronting the sword.</p><p>Feeling the terrifying power behind it, the demon looked back, its heart filled with terror. It let out a low growl, its dark eyes turning crimson.</p><p>At the same time, its fur turned blood-red, and strange runes appeared on its body, like a suit of blood armor.  The blood armor then converged on its sides, forming a pair of blood wings.</p><p>With a powerful flap of its wings, the demon transformed into a streak of blood, its escape velocity dramatically increasing.  The blood light and the sword light streaked across the sky, one after the other.</p><p>However fast the demon's escape, it was still no match for the speed of the sword light. Sensing something amiss, though unsure, the demon's eyes flickered. It flapped its wings, leaving a blood afterimage.</p><p>The afterimage turned, charging fearlessly towards the sword light, roaring.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>Unexpectedly, the sword light dissipated along with the blood afterimage. The sword, which possessed the power to cleave the heavens, was as fragile as a bubble.  Having missed the demon's body, it was shattered by the afterimage.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The sword light retracted its spiritual energy, dispersing and causing chaos. The disorderly spiritual energy again triggered a disturbance.  Though powerful, it was too scattered and chaotic, posing no threat to Nascent Soul cultivators. Only the surrounding plants and creatures suffered, leaving devastation in its wake.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The demon landed on a nearby mountain peak, watching the aftermath.  The shock hadn't yet faded from its expression when anger filled it.  It now realized that the sword was a mere bluff, utterly incomparable to a true master. If a true master had struck, it would have been killed instantly.</p><p>In fact, when the Daoist unleashed the sword, the demon had harbored doubts. Legend had it that human masters rarely moved; once they left the Daoist court, they couldn't hide their aura or cultivation. Besides, if the Daoist was a true master, he wouldn't have spent so long entangled with it.</p><p>But the world was unpredictable, and who could say for sure whether masters possessed methods to conceal themselves?  Moreover, humans were experts in talismans; using talismans, they could unleash power far exceeding their own.</p><p>The leopard demon, had it been less cautious, wouldn't have survived this long.  It was only hired muscle; the treasures the Daoist plundered weren't its concern.  Even a king's ransom wouldn't have tempted it to risk its life, not even a thought of testing the waters.</p><p>Especially considering that sword strike—the command over the elemental energies, the sheer terrifying force, it was all undeniably real.  The disturbance in the elemental energies lingered long after.</p><p>Its gaze dark, the leopard demon mounted a black cloud and retreated the way it came. As expected, the forest was empty; the two were gone.  It looked around, the trail lost. Searching for them in the vast mountain range was akin to finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>After a moment's thought, it sent a message before continuing, its search far less determined than before.  Its escape had forced it to use its Blood Wings and Blood Shadow techniques, both extremely draining. It now deeply feared the Daoist, even suspecting Qin Sang was concealing their true strength.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and the Daoist were already far away, their presence concealed. Qin Sang had reverted to his spirit wood form, the Daoist affixed a concealment charm to himself. While not as effective as Qin Sang's technique, it was enough to fool any patrolling demons.</p><p>Both knew they weren't truly safe yet, silently fleeing, communicating only briefly when necessary. The Daoist had planned their escape route before attacking; Qin Sang, too, had prepared, though they had deviated quite far.</p><p>During their flight, they encountered more demon soldiers.  To Qin Sang's surprise, there was no sign of a large-scale ambush, no demon lords.  Seeing the Daoist's self-assured demeanor, Qin Sang guessed he might have made other preparations, perhaps even had accomplices.</p><p>Days later, they reached the border of Gui Fang. To Qin Sang's relief, the feared blockade wasn't there.</p><p>Having escaped Gui Fang without serious incident, both Qin Sang and the Daoist breathed a sigh of relief.  Confirming their surroundings were safe, they stopped at a mountain pass to recover their energy.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist friend, for your protection."</p><p>The Daoist bowed formally.  At his cultivation level, he shouldn't have been able to unleash that sword strike.  The exertion had been immense.  Qin Sang had kept his promise and hadn't abandoned him.</p><p>"I wield the sword.  May I ask your Daoist name?"</p><p>They had met twice: a brief clash, and then their joint escape from the demon lord. They had shared hardship.  Ironically, they still didn't know each other's names.</p><p>Both times, the Daoist was in the wrong; Qin Sang hadn't asked, making it awkward for the Daoist to bring it up.  Finally, the Daoist broke the silence.</p><p>"My Daoist name is Qingfeng."</p><p>Secretly ordering his Sky-Eyed Butterfly to remain vigilant, Qin Sang replied calmly. The Daoist's name was unusual.  Wielder of the Sword... which sword?</p><p>The thought crossed Qin Sang's mind. He hadn't heard of such a prominent figure at Crane Song Mountain, but the Daoist world was full of hidden talents, so it wasn't surprising.</p><p>"That sword strike earlier…"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, his words trailing off. The memory of the Sword Wielder's strike was vivid; he was reluctant to pry into the other's secrets, fearing a direct question would be too abrupt.</p><p>The Sword Wielder didn't seem to mind. "Forgive my display, Daoist friend. It was partly a bluff, and it consumed a sword charm—not entirely my own power. It has severe limitations. It requires preparation, is quite ostentatious, and only unleashes its true power at the moment the elemental energies coalesce into a sword.  Afterward, it's all for show. Who would be foolish enough to charge ahead knowing that?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. He saw that despite the humility, the Sword Wielder truly could manipulate elemental energies.  Even with external aids, this ability showed profound mastery of the sword.</p><p>Suddenly, the Sword Wielder changed the subject. "Daoist friend, what are your thoughts on the Imperial Bell True Charm?"</p><p>The Imperial Bell True Charm was the talisman that had formed into a protective bronze bell.</p><p>Qin Sang offered unreserved praise. With his cultivation equivalent to only a late Nascent Soul stage cultivator, it allowed him to withstand the demon lord's attack—proving the charm's power. He also noted that the charm’s effectiveness was partly determined by the cultivator's physical strength.  Once his body cultivation advanced, it would become a powerful protective measure.</p><p>The Daoist smiled. "Since you like it, Daoist friend, I'll give you the method for refining it."</p><p>He sent a jade slip flying toward Qin Sang. "I owe you two debts of gratitude, Daoist friend, and I have no other way to repay you.  Consider this a small token of my appreciation. Please don't refuse.  This charm is something I obtained unexpectedly, and it's only usable by physical cultivators.  It’s been wasted in my hands. However, refining this charm is extremely difficult, so you’ll have your work cut out for you."</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, then accepted the jade slip.  His spiritual sense swept across it, and the contents were imprinted on his mind.</p><p>As the Sword-Wielding Daoist had said, refining the Imperial Bell Talisman was no easy task; at least, not before his breakthrough.</p><p>Receiving the Imperial Bell Talisman lessened Qin Sang's reservations.</p><p>They each took a pill and focused on recovering their energy.</p><p>Once recovered, the Sword-Wielding Daoist looked towards the mountain pass and asked, "Where does Daoist Qingfeng plan to go next?  I caused quite a stir; did it affect your plans?"</p><p>"I was summoned for a task. Fortunately, I completed it before your… incident at the Marquis's Mansion," Qin Sang replied vaguely.</p><p>The Sword-Wielding Daoist didn't press further, simply nodding.  "My Daoist abode is at Star Island Lake. I'd like to invite you to come with me, and properly treat you as a guest. Unless you have pressing matters, perhaps we can continue traveling together. While we're not in the Gui Fang country, it's still under their control.  There might be powerful妖侯-level experts hidden, and a chance encounter would be quite troublesome."</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of Star Island Lake.  Located in the north of Ju Shan Prefecture, it was a vast, boundless lake, known as the Sea Lake. As the name implies, countless islands dotted the lake like stars, each with various factions, creating a complex web of power.  There was also a city, second only to Crane Cry Mountain in fame – the second Immortal City of Ju Shan Prefecture.  Some say this city holds the true recognition of Ju Shan Prefecture's cultivators as the first Immortal City.</p><p>Qin Sang was eager to see the different landscapes of this world, and Star Island Lake's complexity might offer more opportunities and Dharma treasures.</p><p>However, Qin Sang knew his current strength wasn't sufficient to roam freely.  Ju Shan Prefecture was in chaos, potentially embroiled in a conflict between the Dao Court and Gui Fang.</p><p>With the Four Seasons Dream Flower in hand, a breakthrough was imminent. The safest course was to return to Crane Cry Mountain and cultivate in peace.  He could always travel later, after the breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Sword-Wielding Daoist, shaking his head. "Thank you for your kindness, but I must return the summoning token and I sense a breakthrough is near. I need to cultivate in seclusion and will visit you later."</p><p>The Sword-Wielding Daoist didn't show displeasure but instead expressed happiness for Qin Sang. "Opportunities are rare, we have plenty of time. I wish you success in your cultivation!"</p><p>"Thank you for the good wishes!"</p><p>They didn't separate immediately. Qin Sang knew little about the demon countries, so traveling with the Sword-Wielding Daoist was safer.</p><p>They traversed the demon territories without incident, eventually reaching a safe area.  It was time to part ways.</p><p>But the Sword-Wielding Daoist stopped Qin Sang, taking out a long wooden box. "I have urgent business and must return to Star Island Lake immediately; otherwise, I would have traveled to Crane Cry Mountain with you. A friend of mine cultivates there and commissioned me to forge a sword. Could you deliver it for me?"</p><p>"This..." Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>It wasn't that he was unwilling, but he and the Daoist had only met twice. While they had fought alongside each other against demonic beasts, they weren't close friends.  If something went wrong during the delivery, could their trust remain intact?</p><p>The Sword-Wielding Daoist smiled, displaying the sword within: a top-grade magic treasure.</p><p>"It's not a precious item. Do you remember the token? When you activate it, you should contact my friend, who will inform me.  If you ever need help, you can directly ask him, and I will arrive as soon as I can."</p><p>Qin Sang realized the Sword-Wielding Daoist was finding a pretext to establish a stronger connection.  He didn't object.  He accepted the sword, examined it, and bowed, saying farewell. He then headed southwest.</p><p>The Sword-Wielding Daoist stood for a moment, before flying north on his sword.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang returned to Crane Cry Mountain safely. He didn't rush to the Dao Court, but first activated the token. Guided by it, he found a courtyard in the city.  The courtyard's owner was already waiting outside, a tall, thin Daoist in green robes, whose Daoist name was Gu Zhou.</p><p>"Mid-Yuan Ying stage." Qin Sang instantly saw Gu Zhou's cultivation level.</p><p>Gu Zhou received the token and the sword, then looked at Qin Sang, his expression turning respectful.</p><p>Qin Sang understood immediately. This person was likely not a friend of the Sword-Wielding Daoist, but more like a subordinate.</p><p>"A mid-Yuan Ying stage expert guarding a single outpost. The Sword-Wielding Daoist seems to be connected to a powerful force." Qin Sang nodded silently, realizing there was no harm in befriending him.</p><p>Shortly after, Gu Zhou escorted Qin Sang out of the courtyard. Qin Sang went directly to the North Pole Exorcism Academy.</p><p>(End)</p>
