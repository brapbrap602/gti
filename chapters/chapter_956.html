<h1>Chapter 948: Searching for the Heavenly Corpse Sect</h1><p>“Fellow Daoist, do you think so too?”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. Bai’s thoughts coincided with his own.</p><p>Since entering the world of cultivation, especially after arriving at the Boundless Sea, Qin Sang's horizons had broadened considerably.</p><p>After obtaining the *Celestial Demon Transformation*, the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art*, and the *Commanding Thunder Technique*, he discovered that these top-tier ancient cultivation techniques and secret arts were all incomplete.</p><p>Later generations could only try to patch them up or find ways to resolve the hidden dangers before they could cultivate them.</p><p>The *Heavenly Yin Corpse Art* was unique, vastly different from other corpse refinement techniques.</p><p>Refining living corpses was only one aspect.</p><p>By utilizing Earthly Yin energy and gathering various spiritual materials, one could refine powerful corpse soldiers without expending vast amounts of time and energy.</p><p>Other corpse refinement techniques required a lengthy corpse nurturing process.</p><p>If Qin Sang had obtained that kind of corpse refinement technique, with his abysmal talent, he would have needed to focus solely on cultivation and wouldn’t have had the energy to dabble in the Dao of Corpses.</p><p>Such a peculiar secret art must have extraordinary origins, possibly no less significant than the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture*.</p><p>After exchanging ideas with numerous fellow Daoists specializing in the Dao of Corpses, Qin Sang speculated whether the ancestor of the Heavenly Corpse Sect had obtained some ancient secret art and integrated it into corpse refinement techniques, thus creating the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Art*.</p><p>Or perhaps this secret art itself was unique, encompassing both the Dao of Corpses and other Daos.</p><p>Bai’s thoughts mirrored Qin Sang’s.</p><p>“From which sect did Fellow Daoist obtain the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Art*?  Perhaps seeing the records of that sect could shed some light on this.”</p><p>Bai continued to inquire.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then said, “To be honest with Fellow Daoist, the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Art* did not originate from the Boundless Sea. I obtained it by chance in another location. The sect was called the Heavenly Corpse Sect and has long been extinct.  A few fellow Daoists and I stumbled upon the ruins of the Heavenly Corpse Sect. Aside from the Heavenly Corpse Tokens, we found no other records.  To investigate the origins of the Heavenly Corpse Sect, I’ll have to return. Whether I can find anything is uncertain…”</p><p>“I see…”</p><p>Bai lowered his head, a contemplative expression on his face, seemingly pondering something.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, do you have any way to temporarily suppress the Heavenly Corpse Talisman?”</p><p>Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>Bai glanced at Yagu and said, “Are you worried about her?  You need to do two things: preserve her physical vitality and prevent the loss of her spiritual intelligence. The life force within her body is incredibly strong, suppressing the corpse energy to a minimum. I imagine only some sort of supreme-grade medicinal pill could achieve that. If it weren't for the fact that this body of mine is beyond recovery by external forces, I would also ask Fellow Daoist for one.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Bai.</p><p>Apart from the portion reserved for the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid, the remaining Three Lights Jade Liquid could only be used as a spirit medicine to restore True Essence.</p><p>He hadn’t used it in the several dangerous situations he'd encountered previously, but that didn't mean it wasn't important.</p><p>After casting the *Sacrificial Thunder Technique*, his True Essence would be almost completely depleted. Consuming the Three Lights Jade Liquid would allow him to quickly recover his combat strength, which was his greatest trump card at the moment.</p><p>Of course, if Bai was willing to trade Soul Nourishing Wood for Three Lights Jade Liquid, that would be acceptable.</p><p>“With this life force nourishing her, her physical body is safe. As for her Primordial Spirit, Fellow Daoist already has the Soul Nourishing Wood, so what are you worried about?  Just have her wear a wooden token made from it, and a solution will eventually be found.”</p><p>Bai said indifferently.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered; it seemed he could only make long-term plans.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Bai sighed softly. “Without the complete secret art, I can only think of other ways to solve this problem. If I truly can't undo the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, I ask Fellow Daoist to take me along to search for the Heavenly Corpse Sect. Helping me is helping yourself. What are your thoughts, Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. "Fellow Daoist, do you mean…"</p><p>Bai nodded. “With my corpse-refined body, I’m afraid it will be difficult to integrate into the present world. Moreover, I know nothing about the outside world. Staying with Fellow Daoist for the time being, while I find a way to recover my strength and familiarize myself with the present world, is a viable option.  However, we will need to make another oath.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly. “Fellow Daoist, you've had this plan for a while, haven't you?  Quite the scheme. Back in the Ghost Lands, you even wanted to use this request as a bargaining chip.”</p><p>“I just didn’t expect Fellow Daoist to be so astute that I had to offer the Soul Nourishing Wood to make you relent.”</p><p>Bai retorted, then his tone shifted. “Fellow Daoist spared no effort to save this woman, indicating you are not a ruthless person. Otherwise, I wouldn't have this idea.  Let’s be clear: while I’m with you, I will choose to intervene in dangerous situations and help you overcome difficulties. But if Fellow Daoist actively enters dangerous territories or uses me as bait, I will not participate. In addition, Fellow Daoist must promise me to search for the Heavenly Corpse Sect as soon as possible…”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in agreement. “Fellow Daoist, there’s no need to urge me. I'm actually more eager to return than you are. What I plan to do next is related to this matter.”</p><p>Qin Sang was naturally more than happy to have Bai accompany him.</p><p>Bai's strength was secondary; his mysterious origins and lost memories were what Qin Sang valued most.</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>Bai’s expression eased. “I’ll enter the Corpse Puppet Pouch to cultivate.  Fellow Daoist should carefully consider how to safely leave the Seven Kills Palace…”</p><p>“Wait,” Qin Sang stopped Bai, surprised. “Aren't you going to explore the Seven Kills Palace?  Perhaps it might trigger your memory. You and so many lost souls are trapped here for a reason.  Perhaps you had a close relationship with the Seven Kills Palace in your previous life.”</p><p>Bai looked around and said, “It’s clear that the Seven Kills Palace is not peaceful and is full of danger.  My strength has not yet recovered, and wandering around might be risky.  As long as Fellow Daoist doesn’t seal the Corpse Puppet Pouch, I can sense the outside…  I’ll explore after my strength recovers.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and agreed.</p><p>After storing Yagu and Bai in the Corpse Puppet Pouch, Qin Sang took one last look in the direction of the wasteland and turned to enter the deep mountains.</p><p>He was going back to the Heavenly Tower to challenge the Sword Path again.</p><p>He wanted to see what lay on the other side of the Sword Path and whether the ancient teleportation formation was there!</p><p>On the way, Qin Sang took out the topographical map. After walking for a while in the mountains and confirming his location, he deliberately deviated from his path, intending to circle back to the crevice where the Tyrant Blood Fruit grew to take a look.</p><p>The Tyrant Blood Fruit was a top-grade body refinement spirit medicine, and one could never have too many.</p><p>It wouldn't be long before his cultivation and physical body both broke through. By then, armed with top-tier magical treasures and secret arts, he might even be able to fight against cultivators at the early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's heart filled with excitement.</p><p>Last time, he hadn't taken everything, only picking the five fruits that were about to ripen. There was still a cluster of green, unripe fruits on the vine.  Decades had passed; he wondered if any new fruits had matured.</p><p>Guarding the Tyrant Blood Fruit was a flock of Red-tailed Cranes. Qin Sang had already gauged their strength last time.</p><p>As long as there were no beast kings among the Red-tailed Cranes, snatching the spirit fruit would be a piece of cake.</p><p>Qin Sang traversed the deep mountains.</p><p>Although his strength far surpassed what it once was, he remained extremely cautious, actively avoiding any areas where he sensed something amiss.</p>
