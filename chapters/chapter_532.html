<h1>Chapter 525: The Beast Tide</h1><p>“Junior Brother Liu?”</p><p>The elder's expression softened slightly, his brow furrowed. “What happened to make you so panicked?”</p><p>Catching his breath, the cultivator surnamed Liu blurted out, “Senior Brother Chai, I just received an urgent message from Senior Brother Qi. A beast tide has suddenly erupted in the second level of the Boundless Valley!”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>The elder’s eyes bulged, and he cried out in alarm. “A beast tide in the second level?  Didn't one just happen two years ago? Why so soon?”</p><p>Not only the elder, but Qin Sang, who was eavesdropping nearby, was also startled.</p><p>A beast tide in the Boundless Valley!</p><p>How could it be so coincidental? A beast tide at this time?</p><p>In the Boundless Valley, a beast tide is equivalent to a natural disaster. Only a significant change or the emergence of a powerful demon could trigger one.</p><p>While beast tides are unpredictable, there's usually a considerable interval between them. Even the first level wouldn't experience two beast tides within three years.</p><p>Otherwise, who would dare to enter and train if the area was constantly ravaged before they could explore it?</p><p>Few cultivators are capable of entering the second level of the Boundless Valley, making the situation far more stable than the first level. In his twenty-plus years at the Azure Sun Market, Qin Sang had entered and exited the second level countless times and encountered only one small-scale beast tide.</p><p>The Boundless Valley is the ultimate training ground for the Azure Sun Demonic Sect's disciples. Especially after the beast tide two years ago, now should be the safest time. Surely, many are currently inside, seeking treasures.</p><p>If a beast tide occurs now, the Azure Sun Demonic Sect would have to dispatch its elites to rescue them or suffer heavy losses.</p><p>The second level is perilous; weaker cultivators would enter only to die.</p><p>Perhaps that Core Formation cultivator will also go!</p><p>Could this be heaven's help?</p><p>Or…</p><p>Doubt flickered in Qin Sang's eyes as he pictured the Wandering Scholar. Logic told him such a coincidence was impossible.</p><p>He knew the Wandering Scholar was powerful, but could a beast tide be triggered by human intervention?</p><p>Cultivator Liu shook his head. “We don’t know yet. Senior Brother Qi’s message said the beast tide appeared without warning. They were training in the second level and are now trapped. They managed to send a distress signal, but we've lost contact.”</p><p>Cultivator Liu opened his palm, revealing a faint Azure Sun Demonic Flame, flickering like a tiny snake.</p><p>This method of transmitting messages with demonic flames is unique to the Azure Sun Demonic Sect and impossible to replicate.</p><p>The elder's divine sense probed the flame.</p><p>A moment later, his expression drastically changed.</p><p>"Quickly, follow me to Sacred Peak to find Junior Brother Li..."</p><p>Grabbing Cultivator Liu, he soared into the sky on his sword, streaking towards the inner sect like a shooting star.  The two figures vanished in an instant.</p><p>After they left, Qin Sang emerged from the shadows, his face a mixture of shock and delight.  He quickly pursued them.</p><p>He decided to stop questioning whether the beast tide was caused by the Wandering Scholar or mere coincidence.</p><p>For him, this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!</p><p>He had to seize it and think of nothing else.</p><p>…</p><p>Sacred Peak.</p><p>Azure mist swirled, and the Sacred Azure Essence had condensed into various forms.</p><p>Some solidified into large jade-like boulders; others hung delicately from cliffs like tassels; still others flowed through valleys like water, their surfaces rippling gently.</p><p>At the foot of Sacred Peak, the Sacred Azure Essence was more dispersed, clinging lightly to objects like denser mist.</p><p>Near the summit, the essence primarily took the form of jade-like boulders, though they were scarce, with vast distances separating each one.</p><p>This solid form is the true Heavenly Essence!</p><p>A fist-sized piece of Sacred Azure Essence was embedded in the center of a perfectly smooth stone platform, clearly crafted by human hands.</p><p>A middle-aged cultivator in a white robe sat cross-legged beside it.  His cultivation was astonishingly at the pseudo-Core Formation stage!</p><p>His hands were outstretched towards the Sacred Azure Essence, and azure flames emanated from his palms.  A nearly invisible thread of energy connected the flames and the essence.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator was absorbing the Sacred Azure Essence to refine his demonic flames.</p><p>Not far from the summit, lightning crackled incessantly above him, revealing glimpses of the untamed Ancestral Sacred Flame.  Despite this volatile environment, he remained focused, his movements cautious.</p><p>After some time, the cultivator withdrew his demonic flames and glanced at another piece of Sacred Azure Essence to his left.  He was about to move when he suddenly frowned, looking downwards.</p><p>The azure mist churned as figures flew up the mountain.</p><p>Soon, Cultivator Liu and the elder appeared.</p><p>Their faces brightened upon seeing the middle-aged cultivator, and they hastened their approach.  Cultivator Liu, with the weakest cultivation, was awed and slightly intimidated by the terrifying Ancestral Sacred Flame and lightning.</p><p>“Junior Brother Liu, Senior Brother Chai, what brings you here?” the middle-aged cultivator asked calmly, his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>“Junior Brother Li, a beast tide has erupted in the second level of the Boundless Valley. Junior Brother Qi and the others are trapped...”</p><p>Seeing Cultivator Liu’s hesitation, the elder quickly explained the situation, handing over the demonic flame message.</p><p>"A beast tide?"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's face shifted.  After examining the message, he frowned deeply.  He stared at Cultivator Liu and asked, "Besides Junior Brother Qi and the others, who else entered the second level?"</p><p>Cultivator Liu swallowed nervously and stammered, “Only Senior Brother Qi managed to send a distress signal.  We haven't heard from Senior Brother Wang and the others.  We don't know their current location. The valley scouts haven’t reported yet, so the scale of the beast tide is unknown...”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator shook his head.  "Wait here. I'll inform Elder Wu immediately."</p><p>The elder looked surprised.  "Do we need to disturb Elder Wu?"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator snorted.  "The second level is vast, now ravaged by a beast tide. They are scattered. Senior Brother Chai, you don't think a few of us can rescue everyone, do you? If this beast tide engulfs the entire second level, they'll be devoured by the beasts before we even find them! A bunch of fools, failing to detect the signs of a beast tide.  We must ask Elder Wu for help!"</p><p>…</p><p>Far from Sacred Peak, Qin Sang lay hidden in the tall grass, his gaze fixed on the summit.</p><p>He needed to know how many would go to the Boundless Valley.</p><p>He waited, but there was no movement. Just as his anxiety grew, a blaze of light erupted from the summit, piercing the azure mist with astonishing power.</p><p>"I'll go ahead. Take the flying ship and follow immediately!"</p><p>A booming voice echoed from the light before it vanished from Qin Sang's sight, leaving only a lingering resonance.</p>
