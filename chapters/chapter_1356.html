<h1>Chapter 1348: Ye Qiudao (6k, 3-in-1)</h1><p>The Binding Demon Rope was a black iron chain.</p><p>Yu Gu was bound tightly by it, his limbs restrained.</p><p>The rope tightened relentlessly.</p><p>The seemingly small lightning bolts pierced the purple light protecting Yu Gu, effectively countering his defenses.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Yu Gu calmly, generously expending his true energy.</p><p>What followed, however, was completely unexpected.</p><p>Either their self-devised formation couldn't fully unleash the Binding Demon Rope's power, or the ancient texts exaggerated its capabilities, but Yu Gu didn't lose his fighting ability as expected, even when bound.</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>After a brief struggle, Yu Gu clenched his fists, his body glowing intensely purple. A layer of purple light, like armor, formed between him and the rope.</p><p>The Binding Demon Rope, under the impact of the purple light, could no longer constrict further.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>The rope creaked ominously, each link straining and shaking violently, threatening to snap.</p><p>Yu Gu suddenly raised his head, his expression ferocious, staring coldly at Qin Sang, a bloodthirsty grin splitting his lips as he roared, his head thrown back in a long, piercing howl.</p><p>The sound was shrill, like the shriek of a demon.</p><p>Those who heard it felt dizzy and nauseous.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a tightness in his chest, his true energy starting to stagnate, alarming him.</p><p>Amidst the demonic howl, intensely concentrated purple light erupted from Yu Gu's body, coursing through every part of him, shining with an unnatural brilliance.</p><p>Yu Gu's skin glowed.</p><p>Like a work of art!</p><p>This purple light was different from before.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun clearly sensed a significant increase in Yu Gu's resistance; he seemed to have unleashed some incredible secret technique, making him even more formidable.</p><p>Simultaneously, the spirit array formed by the Star Essence Stones weakened in its restriction of Yu Gu.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>The next moment, Yu Gu lightning-fast reached out, grabbing the main body of the Binding Demon Rope.  His speed surprised both Qin Sang and Qing Jun.</p><p>…</p><p>Above.</p><p>Bai stood between Ye Laomo and Yu Gu.</p><p>Although Ye Laomo showed no immediate intention to intervene, caution was necessary.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun, despite their combined efforts using the spirit array and the Binding Demon Rope, were unable to fully suppress Yu Gu. A flicker of surprise crossed Bai's eyes, but his expression remained calm.</p><p>Ye Laomo's gaze was deep and impassive.</p><p>He observed the scene as if an outsider.</p><p>After Qin Sang's appearance, Ye Laomo's attention was drawn to the Binding Demon Rope. When he saw that even the rope was about to be broken by Yu Gu, his eyes flickered slightly, and he looked deeply at Bai.</p><p>Bai's heart tightened; corpse energy gathered in his palm, ready to strike.</p><p>…</p><p>'Creak…creak…'</p><p>Yu Gu held the Binding Demon Rope firmly, pulling it apart with all his might, trying to tear it.</p><p>The main body of the rope was enveloped in purple light, transforming into a purple chain.</p><p>As the manipulator, Qin Sang could clearly sense the terrifying power of Yu Gu, the Binding Demon Rope was genuinely in danger of being destroyed!</p><p>His face changed drastically, doing everything he could to prevent Yu Gu from destroying the rope.</p><p>Suddenly, a cold snort exploded in Qin Sang's ear, a powerful shockwave coming from the Binding Demon Rope. Qin Sang groaned, staggering backward, his face flushed.</p><p>At this time.</p><p>Qing Jun suddenly left the Star Essence Stone array, soaring into the air.</p><p>She dropped her disguise, revealing her stunning figure and face.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Around the blood-red altar.</p><p>Figures appeared one after another.</p><p>Due to Yu Gu's predicament and Ye Laomo's tacit permission, the demonic array, lacking a controller, significantly weakened, allowing the cultivators trapped in the ghost fog to finally break free and rush over.</p><p>True Daoist and Cang Hong Zhenren were a step slower than Qin Sang.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Guan and others arrived later, at varying speeds.</p><p>Figures also appeared from other directions.</p><p>The largest groups were two.</p><p>Dongyang Bo and Tongyou Mojun led a group of Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>On the other side, Jing Yu and the Snake King were together, mainly surrounded by demon cultivators, along with human cultivators like Bing Han and the Yin Mountain Pass City Lord.</p><p>By this time, almost all of the Yuan Ying cultivators who had entered the ghost fog were present.</p><p>They looked up, staring at Qing Jun.</p><p>In a red dress, eternally unchanged.</p><p>Her sleeves fluttered, radiant as fire.</p><p>She was like a phoenix, spreading its wings and soaring!</p><p>This shocking scene was deeply etched into the minds of everyone present, leaving an indelible impression.</p><p>Qing Jun looked at Yu Gu, her expression as calm as when she had once told Qin Sang—that everyone is merely a transient visitor in her life.</p><p>Yu Gu was slightly startled by Qing Jun's bright eyes, inexplicably feeling an unprecedented sense of danger.</p><p>Qing Jun flew in front of Yu Gu, her slender arm raised slightly, her jade-like fingers dancing with a unique rhythm and beauty.</p><p>Qin Sang, standing beside them, was also stunned. He couldn't fathom Qing Jun's intentions.</p><p>To better control the spirit puppet, Qin Sang had consulted Qing Jun on puppetry techniques. Qing Jun had been generous with her knowledge, even bringing out an ancient text on puppet seals to personally guide him.</p><p>He guessed she was using a puppet seal technique, but couldn't identify which one.  Each seal in the ancient text had a different function, none matching Qing Jun's current actions or suitable for this situation.</p><p>“Could it be a new puppet seal? It seems far more complex than anything in the ancient text. Wait! This is…”</p><p>A look of intense shock flashed across Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>The moment Qing Jun completed the seal, a faint grey mist emerged from the bone marrow of Yu Gu's left big toe.</p><p>The grey mist, weak in the purple light, was exceptionally tenacious. It was embedded within Yu Gu's bones and spread rapidly throughout its body.</p><p>Ye Lao Mo and Kong Meng's pupils constricted.</p><p>Yu Gu glanced down, its face changing drastically, its purple light frantically attacking the grey mist.</p><p>However, the mist, like a malignant growth, was deeply embedded in its bone marrow, inextricably bound to the skeleton.  Even the powerful purple light couldn't expel it.</p><p>Ignoring his shock, Qin Sang used the Binding Demon Rope with all his might to subdue Yu Gu.</p><p>Qing Jun's eyelids fluttered, exchanging a brief, almost imperceptible nod with Qin Sang.</p><p>Soon, Yu Gu's entire body was covered with the grey mist.  The mist shifted, gradually forming the outline of a puppet seal.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, gradually understanding the situation, his surprise growing.</p><p>The grey mist was undoubtedly the manifested puppet seal, already deeply implanted in Yu Gu, turning it into a puppet!</p><p>With Qing Jun's current cultivation, no matter how sophisticated the technique, it was impossible to plant a puppet seal within Yu Gu undetected.  Even for an ordinary Yuan Ying cultivator, it would be impossible.</p><p>Unless, Qing Jun had acted long ago!</p><p>Considering all possibilities, Qing Jun's only opportunity to approach Yu Gu was during the Blood Pool battle, that final struggle with Ye Lao Mo. While seemingly knocked away by Ye Lao Mo after grabbing Yu Gu, Qing Jun secretly transferred the puppet seal into Yu Gu!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.  No wonder after leaving the Blood Lake, he felt something was missing from Qing Jun, though he couldn’t pinpoint it. She didn't look seriously injured, yet her recovery took a long time, even her Qingluan puppet was unusable during that period.</p><p>Qing Jun had transferred the puppet seal from Qingluan into Yu Gu, secretly turning it into a puppet!</p><p>That was precisely what happened. Qing Jun wasn't incapable of fighting Ye Lao Mo.  But a life-or-death battle was necessary, and snatching the corpse from Ye Lao Mo was uncertain.</p><p>Yu Gu’s consciousness had already vanished, even a skeleton would be of little use.  Qing Jun assessed the situation and decided to use a plan, controlling Yu Gu with the puppet seal, feigning defeat and letting Ye Lao Mo take it.</p><p>This way, if Ye Lao Mo did anything to Yu Gu, she could use it to explore the secrets of the Abyss of Sin, perhaps even launch a surprise attack.</p><p>However, the situation didn't unfold as she planned.  Ye Lao Mo, betraying the Abyss of Sin, escaped to the God's Palace.</p><p>Upon receiving news, Qing Jun left the city overnight, circling the entrance to the God's Palace, sensing no trace of the puppet seal, she returned disappointed.</p><p>Her earlier actions of covering the retreat at the God's Palace were actually a cover for sensing the puppet seal.  She was also the first to discover Ye Lao Mo's location.</p><p>All her previous questions about her senior sister were now answered.</p><p>Qin Sang, pondering this, found herself with even greater questions.  She stared intently at the grey energy within Yu Gu's body, utterly perplexed.  "What kind of puppet seal is this?  It bypassed even Ye Laomo's perception.  And the demon, after reincarnating in Yu Gu's body, didn't even notice it!"</p><p>In fact, it was a Heart Demon Puppet Seal!</p><p>Qing Jun, cultivating the "Lifeless Demon Seal," had been plagued by a heart demon for many years.</p><p>With her extraordinary talent, after killing Leng Yuntian and advancing to Yuan Ying stage, she quickly devised a way to eliminate this threat.</p><p>But she felt that simply destroying the heart demon that had plagued her for so long was too wasteful.  Couldn't she utilize it somehow?</p><p>Never lacking in courage, she allowed the heart demon to coexist with her, turning her attention to puppet seal techniques. After a hundred years of intense study, she created a unique secret technique, refining the terrifying heart demon into a unique Heart Demon Puppet Seal!</p><p>A Heart Demon Puppet Seal.</p><p>Astonishing and unprecedented!</p><p>If word got out, who in the cultivation world wouldn't be shocked?</p><p>This puppet seal inherited the intangible nature of the heart demon, hidden within Yu Gu's body, unbeknownst to Ye Laomo, and even undetected by the demon after its reincarnation.</p><p>Of course,</p><p>this was also because the demon had only recently escaped, its power not yet fully restored.</p><p>Had the demon been at its peak, or if Ye Laomo hadn't been so wary of it and released it twenty years earlier, the Heart Demon Puppet Seal would have likely been discovered long ago.</p><p>A fortunate coincidence.</p><p>Who would have thought that Qing Jun's sudden inspiration would play such a crucial role at this moment!</p><p>With the Heart Demon Puppet Seal revealed,</p><p>the demon inhabiting Yu Gu sensed danger and frantically channeled purple light to suppress it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Heart Demon Puppet Seal had already integrated into Yu Gu's body before the demon's possession.  The demon had essentially walked into a trap; the puppet seal could not be so easily expelled. Furthermore, without the Demon Binding Rope, even if Qing Jun activated the Heart Demon Puppet Seal, controlling the demon would have been extremely difficult.</p><p>The combination of these factors finally brought a look of panic to Yu Gu's face!</p><p>Through his skin, one could clearly see the grey energy becoming denser, forming a mysterious puppet seal, its fluctuations subtle, imprinted on every bone.</p><p>No matter how fiercely the purple light attacked, it couldn't erase the seal.</p><p>To make matters worse, Yu Gu couldn't spare his energy to resist the Demon Binding Rope.</p><p>The Demon Binding Rope and the formation array had fully merged. Each iron chain, dark and gleaming, tightly bound Yu Gu, black lightning piercing deep into his body, suppressing the purple light, working in concert with the Heart Demon Puppet Seal.</p><p>Even so, Yu Gu did not lose his ability to resist, struggling wildly.</p><p>The Heart Demon Puppet Seal, the purple light, and the Demon Binding Rope—</p><p>three forces clashed within him, emitting terrifying energy fluctuations.</p><p>"Help me! Kill her!"</p><p>Yu Gu roared at Ye Laomo, begging for help for the first time.</p><p>Ye Laomo was completely engrossed in the spectacle.</p><p>His attention wasn't on his ally, Yu Gu, but on Qing Jun.</p><p>Though he didn't understand the origin of the Heart Demon Puppet Seal, he guessed that Qing Jun had tampered with things in the Blood Pool, a chilling realization that filled him with fear.</p><p>He considered himself cunning and intelligent, yet he had fallen prey to this young woman's scheme without realizing it. For a time, he had kept Yu Gu's skin close to him, essentially planting a time bomb.</p><p>Fortunately, his plans hadn't clashed with Qing Jun's.  He had hidden in the Sin God Palace for twenty years, otherwise, he truly would have been sunk.</p><p>Hearing Yu Gu's plea,</p><p>Ye Laomo glanced at Bai, who looked ready for battle, chuckled, and said calmly, "Think carefully about the oath we made. If our positions were reversed, would you stand idly by or save me? You know what lies beyond the summoning platform. You deliberately obscured the conditions, leaving loopholes in the oath, never intending to spare my life, did you? Did you ever consider that one day you might be caught in your own trap?"</p><p>Ye Laomo looked at Yu Gu, a sardonic smile on his face.</p><p>"You!"</p><p>Yu Gu was stunned, shouting angrily, "You're mad! Without my protection, you'll never survive the spatial turbulence!"</p><p>Unfazed by the threat, Ye Laomo calmly replied, "I recall you saying that when leaving this realm, the most dangerous spatial storm would be largely blocked by the Ziwei Palace.  Using the Ziwei Palace to escape this realm, even a late Yuan Ying cultivator has a chance of surviving the spatial turbulence."</p><p>Compared to constantly guarding against an unknown ancient demon, Ye felt that venturing into the spatial turbulence alone offered a better chance of survival.  Your only use is to unlock the restrictions on the gateway.  Someone is willing to help me eliminate this major threat, and Ye naturally welcomes it…"</p><p>He said.</p><p>Elder Ye raised his head, his gaze seemingly piercing the heavens, looking towards the unknown. His eyes burned with intense fervor.  For countless years, the dream sought after by countless exceptionally talented cultivators was within his grasp. He was about to leave Beichen Realm, break free from his cage, and venture into a wider world!</p><p>These words caused an uproar among the Yuan Ying cultivators.  This passage revealed too much information, each piece shocking and astounding.</p><p>"The Purple Micro Palace isn't emerging; it's going to tear through space and flee?"</p><p>"What does leaving this world mean?"</p><p>"What is this gateway?"</p><p>"Could it be ascension? No! Legend says only Great Ascension cultivators can ascend through tribulation. The gap between Yuan Ying and Great Ascension is vast; where could one possibly ascend to?"</p><p>…</p><p>Everyone was bewildered. They doubted their ears or thought Elder Ye had gone mad. How many more secrets were there in this world that they didn't know?</p><p>However, these doubts didn't affect their judgment.  They wouldn't just watch from the sidelines; they joined the battle.</p><p>Some rushed to help Qin Sang and Qing Jun.  Others charged towards Elder Ye. Old and new grudges would be settled together!  The news Elder Ye had just revealed sent shockwaves through everyone. They couldn't let him leave; they had to get to the bottom of everything.</p><p>But Elder Ye seemed fearless, ignoring everything. He stood with his hands behind his back, gazing at the sky.</p><p>The sky completely collapsed, as if a huge hole had been torn open. A terrifying spatial storm raged from within the hole, and a shadowy form could be vaguely seen in the depths of the void—the inner hall of the Purple Micro Palace reflected there.</p><p>Below the bloody altar, a figure silently appeared—the tall and thin cultivator who had recently chanted the Rebirth Mantra for the blood infant. He had also taken the Withering Yuan Pill and was suffering from its effects, knowing his future was bleak.  Witnessing Yu Zhen's tragic fate as a blood infant filled him with hatred for Elder Ye.</p><p>A resolute look flashed in the tall cultivator's eyes. He spat out a spiritual blade.  The blade was shorter than his finger, completely transparent, like it was forged from black ice. His robe billowed as he channeled the blade, wrinkles rapidly appearing on his face as it drained his essence. Finally, he closed his eyes, merging with the blade.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The blade's energy was shocking! Like a startled rainbow, it was faster than any other magical weapon, slashing towards Elder Ye!</p><p>In an instant, the blade plunged into the storm, incredibly close to Elder Ye, aiming directly for his back.</p><p>Elder Ye floated in place, seemingly captivated by the celestial phenomenon above, completely unaware of the impending danger.</p><p>Bai's eyes flickered with hesitation, unsure whether to intervene.</p><p>Just then, a faint blood mist suddenly enveloped Elder Ye, and a blood shadow stepped out from him—a blood demon avatar.  Shockingly, this blood demon avatar's aura was comparable to Elder Ye's, even seemingly surpassing it!</p><p>"Another peak mid-Yuan Ying stage blood demon avatar!" someone exclaimed.</p><p>Elder Ye had lost a blood demon avatar in the Blood Lake battle, yet he'd created another in only twenty years.  However, Qin Sang and True Person Cang Hong realized something was amiss.</p><p>Qin Sang, in particular, immediately understood something upon seeing this. During the Yuanxu battle, he and the Serpent King were relentlessly pursued by Elder Ye, unable to fight back. Even then, he sensed it wasn't Elder Ye's true form, but a blood demon avatar.</p><p>The pressure from that blood demon avatar had been immense, leaving a lasting impression. In the Blood Pool battle, with eighteen Demon Banners, the blood demon avatar seemed less powerful; he even forced it to self-destruct.</p><p>Now he realized his opponents in those two battles might not have been the same.  Elder Ye had two blood demon avatars all along!</p><p>What was his purpose in hiding this avatar?</p><p>Then Qin Sang noticed Bai's tense posture, realizing a possibility that shocked him—perhaps Beichen Realm wasn't devoid of Great Cultivators!</p><p>The blood demon avatar stood beside Elder Ye.  The original body and the avatar exchanged a glance and nodded.</p><p>A bloody light flashed, and a blood-forged avatar vanished into Ye Laomo's forehead.</p><p>Ye Laomo's eyes instantly turned bloodshot, his brows furrowed in pain, a long howl escaping his lips that pierced the heavens.  At that moment, his aura exploded.</p><p>He spread his arms wide, as if embracing the sky, his long hair wildly dancing, his demonic power terrifying.  Before the shocked and awestruck gazes of the onlookers, his cultivation surged, instantly breaking through the late-stage Nascent Soul bottleneck and firmly entering the late-stage Nascent Soul realm!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A spirit blade arrived.</p><p>Yin and Yang dual halberds appeared silently, shimmering with Yin and Yang light, blocking the spirit blade.  A single clash shattered the blade and propelled the halberds towards the tall and slender cultivator with astonishing speed.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The Yin and Yang halberds pierced his chest.</p><p>Blood sprayed.</p><p>The tall and slender cultivator flew backward, his body rigid, a gaping hole in his chest.  While seemingly undamaged elsewhere, his Nascent Soul and primordial spirit were shattered by the halberds.  The light in his eyes rapidly faded, a final lingering look at this world.  There was no resentment, no anger, only a quiet regret.</p><p>Ye Laomo, after centuries of forbearance, had reached this point, truly deserving the title of a great hero.  Even as enemies, the slender cultivator had to admit Ye Laomo was a top-tier figure in the world.  Outmatched, he died without complaint.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The tall and slender cultivator's eyes closed forever, his body torn apart by the storm, vanishing from the world.</p><p>The attacks of True Person Canghong and the others followed swiftly. The Yin and Yang halberds unleashed their divine power; the Yin and Yang energy formed a Taijitu (Yin-Yang fish symbol), protecting Ye Laomo with the halberds at its core.</p><p>Soon, Ye Laomo's cultivation stabilized, firmly establishing him among the Grand Cultivators!</p><p>The sole Grand Cultivator in Beichen Region!</p><p>The undisputed top expert of Beichen Region!</p><p>The entire audience was stunned!</p><p>Qing Jun, engrossed in manipulating the Heart Demon Puppet Seal, couldn't help but turn his gaze towards him.</p><p>Yu Gu was also stunned. He had underestimated this man, underestimated the cultivators of this world.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  Outsiders claimed he would replace Ye Laomo as the top expert of Beichen Region, but he knew he was still far from the peak.</p><p>Exceptional individuals constantly emerge in the world.</p><p>His senior sister, Ye Laomo…</p><p>If Senior Qingzhu hadn't fallen, their achievements would not have been inferior.  Their intelligence, willpower, methods, and talent were all top-tier.</p><p>Ye Laomo had long since broken through the late-stage Nascent Soul bottleneck.</p><p>Upon learning of the opportunity to leave this realm, he agreed to cooperate with Yu Gu, but his vigilance towards the demon never diminished.  Knowing that neither a Heart Demon oath nor a karmic oath was reliable, only a personal life-saving measure would set his mind at ease.</p><p>To this end, he used a secret technique to seal part of his cultivation.</p><p>The self-destruction of another blood demon avatar in the blood pool not only blocked Tianzheng Lao Ren's escape route but also served another purpose: to appear weak before Yu Gu.</p><p>Announcing his breakthrough to the late Nascent Soul stage earlier would have made everything easier.</p><p>But he preferred a more troublesome approach, manipulating everyone, even Yu Gu!</p><p>"Ye Qiudao, you dare!"</p><p>Sensing mortal danger, Yu Gu screamed madly, behaving like a lunatic.</p><p>Ye Laomo stood proudly in the void, never once glancing down.</p><p>His gaze shifted, looking down from above, his eyes appraising Bai, “I don't ask about your origins. Kill him, and Ye will leave you a place on the Ascension Platform.  Whether you can survive the spatial turbulence is up to you.”</p><p>Bai chuckled dryly, “No need for your trouble, Daoist Ye. We have our own ways.”</p><p>Bai secretly rejoiced that he hadn’t attacked Ye Laomo.</p><p>If Ye Laomo were only at the peak of the mid-stage Nascent Soul, he still might have a chance to fight.</p><p>Who would have thought Ye Laomo was hiding his strength so well? (To be continued)</p>
