Chapter 1878: First Probe into the Storm


Qin Sang kept Qi Dashi's true inheriting disciple and two strongly built registered disciples.

Both registered disciples had been specifically chosen by Qin Sang, prepared to inherit the *Profound Mysteries Manual*.  However, Qin Sang had no intention of re-establishing the Profound Mysteries Temple, nor did he want them to call him Master.  Once their learning was complete, they could establish their own sects.

Qin Sang channeled his True Essence, activating the fire chamber formation.  The power of the flames grew stronger and stronger, burning intensely.

Although the five disciples weren't observing Qin Sang's refining for the first time, his previous works were mere practice. They stood respectfully to the side, not daring to breathe, for fear of causing any mistakes.

"No need to be nervous. What you've learned has already surpassed your master. As long as you haven't been slacking in your daily practice, remain calm and composed, and follow my instructions, there will be no problems," Qin Sang glanced at them and said indifferently.

"This junior will remember your teachings and dare not slack off," the five disciples bowed in unison.

Qin Sang spoke no more. With a flick of his finger, beams of treasured light flew out. Among them were the damaged Mingshan Armor and various spiritual materials and treasures, the most precious of which came from the Dao Court.

He intended to re-refine the Mingshan Armor into an inner armor, but he wouldn't completely revert it to its original form. Qi Dashi had laid a good foundation, and many of his ideas couldn't be realized due to limitations in ability, but Qin Sang could now achieve them.

Except for the most important spiritual materials, the refining was primarily done by the five disciples. Qin Sang held the Mingshan Armor, continuously inscribing something on it.

Knowing the rarity of this opportunity, the five worked diligently. Qin Sang occasionally offered a few pointers, and there were no major errors.

After completing the initial preparations, the five disciples were exhausted, but none were willing to leave. Instead, they were rather excited because Qin Sang was about to begin the smelting.

They couldn't participate much in the subsequent refining, but Qin Sang occasionally explained things, and every word and action benefited them greatly.

One month later.

The intensity of the flames gradually subsided. Qin Sang gazed at the crimson flames and beckoned with his hand. A streak of red light flew into his grasp, flames scorching his palm.

All five disciples looked expectantly at Qin Sang's hand.

An object gradually emerged from the fire. It was a piece of inner armor, seemingly very soft and pliable, able to be rolled up into the size of a fist. It felt weightless, yet it wasn't made of silk or any known fabric. Residual flames danced on its surface, unable to harm it in the slightest.

As the flames dispersed, Qin Sang felt a coolness in his palm. He channeled True Essence into the armor, unfolding it to reveal a piece as thin as a cicada's wing.

Qin Sang summoned his Palm Heart Sword and thrust it towards the inner armor.

*Swish!*

A sound like the clang of metal resonated. The inner armor merely rippled, completely unscathed, without even a scratch.

"Not bad!  There's no need to change the name. It shall still be called the Mingshan Armor."

Qin Sang smiled, nodding in satisfaction. After a brief refinement, he activated the Mingshan Armor and wore it beneath his Daoist robe. It was light as air.

"Cultivate diligently. I'll return to assess your progress when I have time."

With that, Qin Sang deactivated the fire chamber formation, stood up, and walked out.

The five disciples respectfully acknowledged his words and escorted Qin Sang out of the residence before hurrying back to their closed-door cultivation.

After leaving Qi's residence, Qin Sang traveled west alone. As usual, he first visited Venerable Zhenru to discuss the Sun Wheel Seal.

Through years of contemplation by Qin Sang and the eminent monks of Mirror Terrace Temple, their understanding of the Sun Wheel Seal gradually deepened.

However, Qin Sang clearly felt that as he grasped the Inner and Outer Scenery and began to comprehend Dharma Manifestations, his comprehension of the Sun Wheel Seal also accelerated.

After a brief stay at Mirror Terrace Temple, Qin Sang continued westward, entering the White Stone Altar and meeting with Immortal Yuan.

"Have you decided? Oh? Your cultivation has broken through again. It seems you have considerable confidence this time," a hint of surprise flashed in Immortal Yuan's eyes.

Qin Sang calmly replied, "Whether I succeed or not, I can't delay any longer. If I miss the opportunity, I fear even death wouldn't be enough to atone."

"The situation hasn't reached that point yet, but early preparation is good," Immortal Yuan didn't return the war drum. Instead, he took out a jade slip. "Inside are my insights from these years. Take it and study it. Before the smelting, the fire formation must be adjusted accordingly to better suit the treasure. This is also described in the *Profound Mysteries Manual*. There are many taboos within the altar, and only I can personally make these adjustments."

"Thank you for your trouble, Senior," Qin Sang took the jade slip, bowed, and was led by a Golden Armored Guard to a golden hall for closed-door cultivation.

This seclusion lasted nearly half a year.  Qin Sang benefited from the guidance of both Master Gu and Immortal Yuan, bolstering his confidence.

Inside the Altar's fire chamber.

Qin Sang sat cross-legged beside the blazing fire, while Immortal Yuan sat opposite him.  He glanced at Qin Sang through the firelight. "Begin."

Qin Sang took a deep breath and tossed the war drum into the flames. The drum had been restored by Immortal Yuan to its damaged state.

Simultaneously, Qin Sang offered up precious spiritual materials, beginning the refinement process.

With Immortal Yuan's assistance in controlling the fire, Qin Sang's task was much easier.

He wouldn't be arrogant enough to think that inheriting the Profound Mysteries Temple legacy and receiving Immortal Yuan's guidance would allow him to repair a Postnatal Spirit Treasure single-handedly.

If not for the two refining masters successively passing on their insights, providing him with a clear path and direction, Qin Sang wouldn't know how much longer he would need to accumulate experience.

Qin Sang firmly remembered every word from Master Gu and Immortal Yuan. His goal was to grow through this refining process, not to be unconventional.

The spiritual fire transformed endlessly in Qin Sang's hands.  The essence was extracted from each spiritual material.  To prevent failure, Immortal Yuan had prepared three sets of materials, but Qin Sang's performance was much smoother than he had anticipated.

Gradually, Immortal Yuan relaxed his control over the spiritual fire and discovered that Qin Sang remained unfazed, his fire control exceptional and his spiritual sense incredibly acute.  He couldn't help but reveal a look of approval.

With the refinement of the spiritual materials complete, Qin Sang immersed his mind into the war drum, his focus unwavering.

At the same time, he formed hand seals, manipulating wisps of flame, striking the drum surface with varying intensity.

*Dong! Dong! Dong!*

The drumbeat resonated, contained within the fire chamber by the spiritual formation.

Soon, a red glow emanated from the drum's surface, growing increasingly radiant, almost rivaling the spiritual fire.

Surprisingly, a layer of fine sweat appeared on Qin Sang's forehead, clearly indicating the difficulty of this step.

As time passed, the war drum underwent further transformation. Fine threads faintly appeared amidst the red glow, countless restriction runes of incredible complexity.  An ordinary cultivator would become dizzy just from a glance.

Qin Sang worked tirelessly, his gaze fixed on the drum surface.

A crucial step in refining was known as "Connecting the Qi Meridians."  Repairing treasures also began with this step. Qin Sang's actions were meant to stimulate the remaining Qi meridians of the war drum, combing and mending them.

With the war drum damaged, its Qi meridians were withered and chaotic.  Even with the "guidance" of two refining masters, Qin Sang still felt immense pressure.

Time was meaningless within the fire chamber.

Qin Sang was completely absorbed in his work, steadily completing each step.

The essence extracted from the spiritual materials floated quietly around Qin Sang.  After an unknown period, he finally summoned a wisp of Azure Spiritual Qi, which slowly drifted towards the hole in the war drum.

The Azure Spiritual Qi covered the hole, swirling erratically.  Qin Sang rapidly changed his hand seals, beams of light striking the hole. The drum surface and the Azure Spiritual Qi resonated, the Qi gradually condensing into a light veil, perfectly sealing the hole.

Completing this step, Qin Sang let out a long breath, a look of excitement on his face.

"Excellent! I prepared five Origin Silk Grasses for you, but I didn't expect you to succeed on the first try. It seems you have quite the talent, but you lacked proper guidance before. Rest for a bit," Immortal Yuan nodded repeatedly, helping Qin Sang stabilize the war drum.

Although Qin Sang was no longer at an age where he needed encouragement, he couldn't help but feel invigorated by the Grand Immortal's praise. He immediately entered meditative recovery.

As clumps of refined spiritual essence were driven into the fire, the holes in the drum surface were gradually filled, the damage almost imperceptible.

There were occasional minor missteps, but nothing serious.


However, this wasn't the final stage.  "A journey of a hundred miles is only half completed at ninety."  The next step, truly fusing the spiritual materials with the drum body and connecting the Qi meridians, was the most difficult!


"Hu!"

Qin Sang recovered once more, exhaling softly, his face solemn. He plunged his hands directly into the fire.


The spiritual fire surged. Initially, the war drum remained unchanged, but then it seemed to melt, a glaze-like sheen appearing, flowing over the repaired areas and across the entire drum body.


Finally, the original form of the war drum vanished, transformed into a radiant crimson spiritual embryo.


"Don't miss this opportunity. Don't hesitate!" Immortal Yuan's voice rang out, a reminder.


Qin Sang didn't hesitate, immediately driving a prepared hand seal into the crimson spiritual embryo.


*Swish!*


A wave pulsed from the crimson spiritual embryo, shaking the spiritual fire, which Immortal Yuan promptly suppressed.


Qin Sang was now completely focused, intently watching every change in the spiritual embryo, his hands moving swiftly.


*Bang! Bang! Bang!*


The crimson spiritual embryo contracted amidst constant vibrations. The glaze flowed faster and faster, indicating the fusion taking place within.


Finally, when the embryo shrunk to a certain extent, no matter what hand seals Qin Sang used, he couldn't change it further.


Sweat dripped from Qin Sang's temples, partly due to the immense energy expenditure and partly because it wasn't as smooth as he had hoped.  He had encountered a difficulty.


*Pa!*


Qin Sang clasped the crimson spiritual embryo tightly, dense blood Qi emerging.  Unhesitatingly expending his vital essence, he employed a Profound Mysteries Temple secret technique.  Blood Qi surged into the embryo, finally causing it to distort, the outline of the war drum faintly taking shape.


Every subsequent step was incredibly arduous.


Until finally, the intact war drum was nearly reborn, but Qin Sang found himself always falling short, despite his best efforts.


Seeing his energy dwindling rapidly, unable to continue, Qin Sang finally shifted his gaze towards Immortal Yuan.


In the next moment, powerful True Essence erupted from Immortal Yuan's palm. The temperature in the fire chamber soared.  The spiritual fire instantly condensed to its peak, surging into the crimson spiritual embryo.


*Boom!*


A wave of fire swept through the fire chamber.


At the heart of the fire wave appeared a spiritual drum.  The holes in the drum surface were gone, and the light it emitted was richer and more refined than after Master Gu's repairs.


Qin Sang took it in his hands, examined it, and passed it to Immortal Yuan.  Reflecting on the refining process, he felt some regret.


Master Gu would have done better, and Master Gu's cultivation was inferior to his.  Therefore, the difference wasn't in cultivation, but in understanding of the Dao of Refining.


However, after this experience, Qin Sang had many epiphanies and couldn't wait to find a place to meditate.  Once he digested these gains, his refining skills would surely advance by leaps and bounds.


*Dong!*


The drumbeat startled Qin Sang from his thoughts.


Immortal Yuan struck the drum several times, then mused, "The residual power is close to that of a Spirit Treasure. I will be in seclusion for a very long time... Fellow Daoist is surely eager to enter seclusion as well, so I won't keep you."


"Thank you, Immortal Yuan, for your guidance."


Qin Sang stood, bowed in gratitude, and exited the fire chamber. Calculating the time, he realized more than three months had passed.


His transaction with the Dao Court was complete. The war drum didn't belong to him, but Immortal Yuan hadn't refused future inquiries.


No matter how he considered it, Qin Sang felt he had profited.


With Immortal Yuan in seclusion, he couldn't stay at the altar for long.  He borrowed a quiet chamber from Master Gu.

...

One year later.

Qin Sang emerged from seclusion, left the White Stone Altar, and traveled north alone. The journey was uneventful, and he returned to the Ju Mountain Altar.

Passing through the auspicious clouds and entering the golden hall, Qin Sang sent a signal. Soon, a streak of light flew towards him. It was Mo Xingdao.

"I was delayed discussing refining techniques with Master Gu," Qin Sang apologized.

"It's fine!  When I received your message, Fellow Daoist, I came here. I explored on my own, but unfortunately, before I could approach the storm illusion you mentioned, I felt strained and didn't dare continue," Mo Xingdao sighed.  "It's truly unrecognizable inside!"

As they spoke, the two passed through the Nine-Bend Star River, traversing the illusions and arriving at the edge of the illusion storm.

Mo Xingdao stood before the storm, silent for a long time.


Qin Sang then said, "We won't know what it's like inside until we enter!"


With that, Qin Sang activated the altar, opened the Eight Gates, and summoned Gui Hou.


Gui Hou's divine abilities were truly remarkable.  In just a few decades, he had restored his physical body and recovered eighty percent of his strength.


Upon learning they were about to enter the illusion storm, Gui Hou was apprehensive, but he didn't dare disobey Qin Sang's orders.


Then, Qin Sang took out some protective talismans. The three of them each displayed their divine abilities, forming a Three Talents Formation, cautiously flying towards the storm.


Qin Sang led the way, employing all his protective techniques, including the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, the Parting and Joining Divine Light, and the Mingshan Armor.  The Cloudsoar Sword hovered above his head, its light enveloping the trio.


The moment they entered the storm, chaotic auras assaulted them, and the wind was like a knife.  Qin Sang's body trembled, but he forcefully stabilized himself, the Cloudsoar Sword shining brightly, shielding the three.


With Qin Sang at the forefront, Gui Hou and Mo Xingdao endured far less pressure. They focused on maintaining the formation, supporting Qin Sang as they slowly flew towards the center of the storm.


Their progress was slow, stopping and starting, only continuing forward when they were certain of their safety.


The situation was slightly better than expected. The outer regions of the storm still retained traces of the original illusion boundaries, suggesting the possibility of restoration.


However, as the three ventured deeper, the scene before them became increasingly alarming.


Qin Sang followed the route he remembered, but further in, even traces of the illusion vanished, replaced by utter chaos and a devouring storm, growing increasingly dangerous.


Finally, when they were still a considerable distance from the Crimson Gold Spiritual Needles, Gui Hou and Mo Xingdao felt their strength failing and had to retreat.


Gui Hou, currently the weakest of the three, gasped for breath, his heart pounding.


Mo Xingdao's expression was grim, remaining silent.


Qin Sang knew what he was thinking and could only offer a few words of comfort, mentioning that the Dao Court possessed refining legacies similar to puppetry.  Even if he couldn't find the path to ascension, there might be a way to request it for him.


As he spoke, Qin Sang thought of the Taiyi Star Chariot.


Now it seemed that to brave the storm, even with sufficient manpower, a powerful protective treasure was necessary. According to Bao Gu's message, the Taiyi Star Chariot possessed both movement and defensive capabilities. It was time to begin its restoration. (End of Chapter)
