<h1>Chapter 1115: Parting of Ways</h1><p>Chapter 1115: Parting of Ways</p><p>Before seclusion, Qin Sang left Peach Blossom Valley and visited several nearby market towns.  As a Yuan Shen Sect elder, he could move freely without stealth.  He discreetly sold some demon cores and bones, purchasing several needed treasures. He commissioned others to gather more, agreeing on favorable prices.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang rushed back to Da Sui to inform Li Yu Fu of his secluded location.  He spent some time there, guiding Li Yu Fu and the other two in their cultivation and providing resources.  Before forming his golden core, Qin Sang wouldn't be distracted by building a faction, so he left them to cultivate on their own. His seclusion would last many years, so he wanted to fulfill his duties as their master.</p><p>Li Yu Fu was only at the early Golden Core stage, making him easy for Qin Sang to guide, not to mention Tan Yi En and Bai Han Qiu.</p><p>"If your Grand Master returns, or if you encounter trouble, send me a message. The situation is still unclear, and the cultivation world is turbulent.  The Pure Yang Sect in particular; many factions covet the legacy of the Red-haired Ancestor.  For now, try to avoid extensive outside training, lest you be caught up in the conflict..."</p><p>Before departing, Qin Sang cautioned Li Yu Fu and the others.</p><p>"Yes, Master."</p><p>The three bowed, seeing Qin Sang off.</p><p>On his return journey, Qin Sang detoured through the Shao Hua Mountain region.  Disguised as a Yuan Shen Sect elder, Qin Sang moved more easily, gathering information about old acquaintances.</p><p>For example, Qi Yuan Shou, his former Master Qi. He had died in battle against the Sin Abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang felt conflicted about Qi Yuan Shou. Before learning the truth, he had repeatedly received guidance from Qi Yuan Shou and harbored no ill feelings, even relying on him as a protector. It was true Qi Yuan Shou served the tyrant and spied on him for Dong Yang Bo, but without Qi Yuan Shou's covert protection, his early days at Shao Hua Mountain wouldn't have been so smooth. Neither internal conflicts nor external issues affected him, allowing him to focus solely on cultivation.</p><p>In their limited interactions, Qin Sang sensed a hint of goodwill from Qi Yuan Shou, perhaps guilt, perhaps something else. However, he dared not disobey Dong Yang Bo’s orders.</p><p>Qin Sang deeply understood Qi Yuan Shou's helplessness.  But that didn't mean he could laugh it off and forgive everything.  Every debt must be paid. Qin Sang's target was Dong Yang Bo.</p><p>Forgetting Qi Yuan Shou, perhaps, was the best outcome.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he received tragic news upon his return. Qi Yuan Shou wasn't buried in Shao Hua Mountain, but in his hometown.  A century had passed, and his solitary grave was nearly overgrown.  Death extinguished his presence, leaving no trace.  At that moment, the cultivator and the mortal were no different.</p><p>For reasons unknown, Qin Sang visited Qi Yuan Shou's grave, paused briefly, sighed, and left.</p><p>Afterwards, he visited a mortal nation within Shao Hua Mountain's territory.  There was a cultivator family, the Wen family.  The Wen family was not strong.  They oversaw nearby mortal nations for Shao Hua Mountain, and had a non-family elder, Zhuang Yan.  Zhuang Yan and his fiancee became Dao companions, cultivating together and both forming their foundations. However, their cultivation progress was slow, stalling at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.  They knew their immortal path was hopeless, their ambitions extinguished. Finally, they left their sect and returned to Zhuang Yan's master's family to raise a family.  This was Wen Shixiong, who had guided Qin Sang upon his entry into Shao Hua Mountain.  Wen Shixiong had already passed away and was buried in the Wen family's mountain behind their home.</p><p>A rather prosperous courtyard, situated by the lake at the foot of the mountain, boasted stunning scenery.  An elderly man sat on a recliner, fishing rods before him, by the lakeside.  His eyes were half-closed, as if about to fall asleep—Zhuang Yan.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Suddenly, a water dragon flew from the lake, clawing toward the old man.  But as soon as it formed, it dissipated into droplets. It didn't reach the old man, but it scared away all the fish.</p><p>"You little rascal!  Quite bold, daring to ambush your grandpa!"</p><p>Zhuang Yan opened his eyes, a smile in them as he watched a young girl running towards him.</p><p>"Grandpa, I mastered the Water Condensation Technique in just a few days!  Am I not qualified to join Shao Hua Mountain?"</p><p>The girl pouted, shaking his arm.</p><p>"You, my dear, still have a long way to go!  After several more years of hard cultivation, grandpa will send you to Shao Hua Mountain. Then no one will look down on our Zhuang family."</p><p>Zhuang Yan gently tweaked the girl's nose, a hint of worry flashing in his eyes.  He was over two hundred years old, one foot already in the grave, his lifespan nearing its end. He could no longer protect his juniors.</p><p>The shadow of the Abyss of Sin had long hung over Xiaohan Region.</p><p>When would the cultivation world ever find peace? These younger generations were born into the most turbulent of times; even entering Mount Shaohua, their fates remained uncertain.</p><p>In recent years, Mount Shaohua had lost countless disciples in battle.</p><p>Zhuang Yan suddenly remembered an old friend.</p><p>"Alas! If only Qin Shixiong were still alive," he sighed. "With his determination, he would surely have formed his Golden Core... why did he leave before me?"</p><p>The thought filled Zhuang Yan with endless regret.  He seemed to sense something and abruptly looked up.</p><p>"Grandpa, what's wrong?"</p><p>The girl turned to the lake.</p><p>The lake was empty.</p><p>Zhuang Yan shook his head, suddenly listless. He packed up his things, allowing the girl to support him as he slowly walked towards the courtyard, his steps faltering.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang passed by the Wen family estate, paying respects to Senior Brother Wen.  From afar, she saw Zhuang Yan.</p><p>This might be their last meeting, yet Qin Sang couldn't reveal herself.</p><p>Zhuang Yan hadn't formed his Golden Core.</p><p>However, he had spent his life with the one he loved, raising children—perhaps that was happiness enough.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed her thoughts and returned to Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Qing Jun was not in the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to her cave dwelling to prepare for seclusion.</p><p>Bai emerged from the corpse puppet bag, choosing a room, preparing to close off with Qin Sang. They vowed not to leave until they had thoroughly understood the Corpse Soul Pearl.</p><p>"This Peach Blossom Valley is truly exceptional, and its owner is formidable. Even within the corpse puppet bag, I sensed a sharp edge from her. However, I was then focused on the Corpse Soul Pearl and couldn't appear. I felt a similar aura from Qingzhu – truly remarkable, worthy of being father and daughter."</p><p>Bai spoke highly of Qing Jun.  "It’s improper to just move in without permission. I must pay a proper visit when I have the chance."</p><p>"Be careful when studying the Corpse Soul Pearl; don't damage the peach orchard,"</p><p>Qin Sang warned, unwilling to face Qing Jun's wrath.</p><p>After a brief discussion, they returned to their respective caves.</p><p>Qin Sang sealed her prohibitions and summoned the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>She couldn't neglect the butterfly's cultivation; forming her Nascent Soul would require the butterfly's assistance.</p><p>Luckily, she had acquired some spirit herbs for cultivating the Sky-Eye Butterfly, almost completing the formula.  The butterfly’s growth would be much faster now.</p><p>After consuming the herbs, the Sky-Eye Butterfly landed on Qin Sang's shoulder, nestled close, and fell asleep.</p><p>Next, she needed to quickly restore her previous cultivation.</p><p>Recultivating the Killing Talisman was much easier this time.</p><p>Qin Sang entered a state of deep meditation, her mind connected to the ebony sword, comprehending the true nature of the Killing Talisman, her cultivation rapidly improving.</p>
