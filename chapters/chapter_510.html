<h1>Chapter 503: Unclosed Eyes</h1><p>“Look at you, little Daoist priest, being so polite…”</p><p>The old woman chided Qin Sang, then turned and shouted, “Head of the household, head of the household, we have an extra mouth to feed, serve another bowl of rice…”</p><p>“Are there that many people?”</p><p>From the woodshed, an old man poked his head out, glancing at Qin Sang. His eyes lit up slightly.</p><p>After sizing Qin Sang up, he noticed the mud stains on his leg wraps. A flicker of disappointment crossed the old man's eyes, barely perceptible. He murmured an "oh," and turned back inside.</p><p>The courtyard was extremely cramped and dilapidated.</p><p>In Xian Yuan City, such a rundown dwelling was rare. Qin Sang, with his keen sense of smell, detected the aroma of food wafting from the woodshed – coarse grains and simple vegetables, the same kind he had eaten at the Qing Yang Temple.</p><p>The old couple clearly couldn't afford repairs.</p><p>Following the old woman, he entered a tiny stone house with only two rooms. A thick layer of thatch covered the wooden door. As soon as it opened, a strong smell of herbal medicine filled the air, instantly overpowering the scent of food.</p><p>“Qiu Xian, quickly call the Daoist master.”</p><p>The old woman brought out a small child, very thin and gaunt. Qin Sang knew at a glance that the boy was weak and sickly.</p><p>The room was dimly lit. A crippled eight-legged table, propped up with stones, held a bowl of dark, steaming medicine, obviously brewed for the child.</p><p>The child, Qiu Xian, was shy, hiding behind his grandmother, peeking at Qin Sang.  As their eyes met, he quickly shrank back, too afraid to speak.</p><p>“This child…”</p><p>The old woman affectionately stroked the boy's head, without scolding him. She then greeted Qin Sang: “Qiu Xian is my grandson. His parents died young. He’s been frail since childhood, can’t bear the wind, and we haven't dared let him go out. He's timid and afraid of strangers.  Ah…Little Daoist priest, please sit. Don't mind the place; just fill your belly.”</p><p>“This Daoist is not picky.”</p><p>Qin Sang replied earnestly, and without hesitation sat at the table.</p><p>Qiu Xian needed his grandmother's company before daring to return to the table to take his medicine.</p><p>The dark potion was difficult for a small child to swallow, but Qiu Xian picked up the bowl and quickly drank it down, as if he didn't feel the bitterness.</p><p>The old man brought out food even coarser than what Qin Sang had at the Qing Yang Temple, yet Qin Sang ate heartily and quickly.</p><p>“Don’t rush, eat slowly, there’s more in the pot…”</p><p>The old woman herself didn't eat, happily watching Qin Sang. Suddenly, she said, “Head of the household, if Qiu Xian’s parents hadn't gotten sick, he would be this big by now.”</p><p>The old man put down his bowl, picked up his pipe, took a puff, and mumbled, “He had to go and try to live on 'divine food and dew,' he brought it on himself!”</p><p>Qin Sang paused his eating, then quickly finished his food.</p><p>The old woman tried to serve him more, but Qin Sang shook his head and refused.  “It’s getting late, this Daoist must be on his way…”</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang looked at Qiu Xian and walked over to him.</p><p>Qiu Xian was less afraid of Qin Sang now, slightly shrinking, but he mustered his courage, his bright eyes fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang knelt down and stroked Qiu Xian's small head. He took out a dull yellow jade pendant from his bosom and hung it around Qiu Xian's neck, saying, "Thank you for your kindness, this humble jade piece is a small token of my gratitude..."</p><p>Qiu Xian had no spiritual root.</p><p>#Send 888 cash红包# Follow the vx public account [Book Friend Base Camp] to read popular novels and win 888 cash 红包!</p><p>This jade pendant was carved from a very ordinary yellow stone, hardly jade at all. Qin Sang had simply placed a minor enchantment on it, to prevent other cultivators from coveting it, but enough to help Qiu Xian's health.</p><p>The boy's illness was beyond the capabilities of earthly doctors, but Qin Sang could easily treat it.</p><p>The old couple and Qiu Xian living together would also receive many benefits from the jade.</p><p>“How can we accept this…”</p><p>The old man quickly put down his pipe.</p><p>The couple came closer, saw it wasn't a precious jade, and stopped refusing.</p><p>Qiu Xian played with the pendant, clearly pleased. Suddenly, he hugged Qin Sang's leg, then ran back to hide it.</p><p>The three of them were about to see Qin Sang off when they suddenly heard urgent footsteps outside, followed by loud calls, filled with anxious cries.</p><p>“Doctor Wu! Doctor Wu…”</p><p>“It’s the eldest son of the Liu family!”</p><p>The old woman recognized the voice, suddenly remembering something, exclaimed, “Could it be Old Master Liu…?”</p><p>The old man pondered, murmured an affirmation, and said calmly, “About right, he was ninety-two, I’m afraid he won’t make it through this.”</p><p>The old woman lamented, “Just when his eldest daughter-in-law is about to give birth… he didn’t even last…”</p><p>“They have five generations living together, what’s there to regret?” the old man turned around, putting on a thick padded jacket. “I’ll go take a look, see if they need any help. You stay home and watch Qiu Xian, if you hear anything, don’t wait for me to eat.”</p><p>Qin Sang walked out of the courtyard, watching the old man’s hurrying back, suddenly understanding what he wanted to see.</p><p>…</p><p>The Liu family home.</p><p>Five generations living under one roof, clearly a large family.</p><p>Outside Old Master Liu’s room, dozens of people, old and young, stood, a stark contrast to the old couple’s quiet home.</p><p>These people gathered outside, their expressions serious, not daring to breathe loudly. Even the children knew the atmosphere was wrong, standing quietly beside their parents, not daring to be unruly.</p><p>The room was silent.</p><p>Doctor Wu hadn't arrived yet.</p><p>Everyone was anxiously waiting.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>A series of shouts suddenly came from the room.</p><p>“The eldest daughter-in-law!”</p><p>“Eldest daughter-in-law! Come quickly!”</p><p>…</p><p>The women bustled about, helping a heavily pregnant girl inside.</p><p>An elderly man lay on the bed, his breath extremely weak, visibly exhaling more than inhaling, yet he stubbornly tilted his head to look at the door, his lips moving, as if trying to say something.</p><p>The eldest daughter-in-law came in, visibly frightened.</p><p>At this moment, etiquette was forgotten; those at the bedside quickly made way, guiding the eldest daughter-in-law to the bed.</p><p>The old man’s cloudy eyes suddenly brightened, his fingers twitched slightly.  Those nearby understood, quickly grasping his hand and moving it towards the eldest daughter-in-law’s belly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the hand only reached halfway before his fingers limply fell.</p><p>“Alas!”</p><p>A collective sigh arose from those in the room.</p><p>In a corner of the room, invisible to the mortals present, a Daoist stood.</p><p>Qin Sang watched quietly, his gaze fixed on the old man's lifeless face, observing the lingering resentment in his eyes, thoughtfully.</p><p>“Ninety-two years, five generations living together, rare in the mortal world, yet he still dies with regret?”</p><p>…</p><p>Old Master Liu passed away.</p><p>The Liu residence was filled with weeping and bustling activity.</p><p>By then, Qin Sang had already left the Liu residence. He released his spiritual sense, sweeping across Xian Yuan City, finding nothing unusual, then quickened his pace, heading straight for the capital of Gu Yuan.</p><p>He arrived at the capital city at noon.</p><p>The city guards were no match for Qin Sang.</p><p>Entering the city, he was surprised to find the baozi shop he used to frequent was still there, run by the original owner's descendants.</p><p>He ordered several steamers of meat baozi, devouring them quickly.</p><p>After paying, Qin Sang pointed to the large pile of snow against the wall next to the baozi shop and said, “There’s someone inside.”</p>
