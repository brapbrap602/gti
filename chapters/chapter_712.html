<h1>Chapter 704: Amidst the Chaos</h1><p>Chapter 704: Amidst the Chaos</p><p>The cavern was eerily silent.</p><p>The tense atmosphere was palpable.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered the cause of the Nine Nether Magic Flame's agitation. Was it a powerful spirit fire hidden within the cave, or triggered by the strange cold mist?</p><p>The cave wasn't as deep as they'd imagined.  As Qin Sang mused, the short, stout cultivator at the front stopped, whispering, "The entrance to the chamber is ahead."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed they'd reached the end of the stone steps, arriving at a flat stone floor.</p><p>The space seemed large, but the thick fog severely limited visibility;  nothing was discernible, and even spiritual sense was restricted.</p><p>They pressed on, finally seeing a shadowy black stone wall with a perfectly round hole, its entrance sealed by a black luminous barrier.</p><p>The barrier was thin enough to reveal a small chamber beyond, sparsely furnished. A recently-used shelf was visible on the nearest wall, now empty; the treasures had clearly been taken by the stout cultivator.</p><p>They examined the barrier's intricate restrictions.  Its former power must have been immense to have survived the corrosive mist.</p><p>"Breaking this barrier isn't difficult," the stout cultivator said. "I've been inside already.  It took a lot of my energy alone; with seven of us, it'll be much easier. But be careful; don't destroy the barrier. These restrictions are linked to seal the mist.  Beasts swarm nearby, and if the mist escapes, the disturbance will surely attract powerful demons…"</p><p>They listened attentively to his instructions.</p><p>A female cultivator turned and asked, "Fellow Daoist Fan, where does this mist come from? What's beyond this space? Are there other chambers? Have you been there?"</p><p>The stout cultivator paused, gazing into the mist.  "It's not a wall beyond, but a cliff face, a deep chasm, extremely profound, unknown and mysterious. The mist fills the chasm; it seems to emanate from its depths."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Fan, did you go down? What is in the chasm to create such a strange mist?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>He suspected that if a spirit fire existed, it might be in the chasm's depths, perhaps connected to the mist.</p><p>If the mist was a manifestation of the spirit fire, it would bear the fire's unique aura, explaining the Nine Nether Magic Flame's reaction.</p><p>Qin Sang, usually taciturn, spoke rarely.</p><p>The stout cultivator looked at Qin Sang in surprise and nodded.</p><p>"I descended along the cliff towards the chasm, but it seemed bottomless.  Except for the mist, there was nothing. After a while, I felt an inexplicable fear and dared not continue. I returned to focus on the chamber's barrier."</p><p>"Then I found so many treasures in the chamber.  Unlocking the third layer of restrictions promised unimaginable rewards, so why risk my life exploring the unknown?"</p><p>His words were pragmatic; they all saw the bottomless chasm.  They realized that they would have likely made the same choice.</p><p>Transformed beast hide, Sun-piercing talismans...</p><p>Any one of these items would ensure a worry-free existence at the Core Formation stage; several together were astonishing.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Fan, you mentioned the third layer is very strong, very difficult, and will take a long time. If things don't go smoothly, I fear we won't be able to endure being in the mist for long.  Let's break the barrier without delay," the scholar in green robes said gravely.</p><p>The stout cultivator, his expression serious, nodded slightly. "Then, everyone follow my instructions and attack the barrier point by point.  Using brute force will trigger a backlash, but the force will be small, so don't worry. When a crack appears, rush inside immediately…"</p><p>After confirming everyone understood, the stout cultivator gestured, and they spread out in a fan shape around him, sitting cross-legged.</p><p>He flicked his fingers, releasing seven black bone spikes.</p><p>*Bang bang bang…*</p><p>The spikes struck the barrier – one in the center, six surrounding it.</p><p>They were made from some type of beast bone.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his knowledge of restrictions, recognized them as specialized barrier-breaking tools; their effectiveness remained to be seen.</p><p>Pulling out the bone spikes proved strenuous even for the stout monk.  He gasped for breath before saying, "Fellow cultivators, each of you select a spike and infuse it with your true essence. Then follow my instructions."</p><p>The stout monk chose one from the middle. Qin Sang also selected one at random and infused it with his true essence.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the seemingly insignificant bone spike showed no signs of strain despite absorbing a vast amount of true essence. As more essence poured in, a phantom image appeared on the spike, gradually growing larger.</p><p>Following the stout monk's commands, everyone meticulously executed their task. Soon, the phantom images merged into a giant bone spike phantom, precisely aligned with the center of the luminous barrier.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The stout monk's face flushed red as he bellowed with effort.</p><p>The bone spike phantom shuddered violently, then plunged forcefully into the luminous barrier.</p><p>The next moment, a deafening 'bang' shook the ground.  Those standing so close to the barrier felt their ears ringing.</p><p>Then, a shocking sight unfolded: a fissure split the luminous barrier from top to bottom. Two massive, wave-like ripples suddenly spread out, and a jet of black light erupted from the barrier.</p><p>Everyone's faces changed; they scrambled to dodge. Qin Sang retreated swiftly and decisively.  The black light tore through the chilling mist and scattered the group, throwing everything into chaos.</p><p>At that moment, the stout monk shouted anxiously from the front, "Don't panic! The restriction is broken!  Follow me inside!"</p><p>Qin Sang realized he had retreated too far.  After the initial fright, he sensed that the black light, while spectacular, lacked significant offensive power.</p><p>He stopped, propelled himself forward, and charged towards the black light, quickly returning to the barrier.</p><p>A graceful figure, one of the female cultivators, flashed past him. He could vaguely see several figures inside the stone chamber opposite, indicating others had already entered.</p><p>Seeing her pass through the barrier safely, and with the fissure rapidly closing, Qin Sang hesitated no longer, preparing to dash inside.  But at that very moment, he abruptly stopped.</p><p>A strange look flashed in his eyes. Instead of going in, he retreated.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, what are you waiting for? The restriction is about to reform! Why haven't you entered yet?"</p><p>A dry, thin old man's voice suddenly came from behind him.</p>
