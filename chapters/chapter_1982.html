<h1>Chapter 1973: Entering the Fray</h1><p>On the border of Xuan.  A million soldiers faced each other in a massive standoff.  The armies lined up on either side, their camps stretching for dozens of miles, a sea of tents amidst a multitude of soldiers.  The ground before the armies was stained crimson from countless battles, the blood seeping deep into the earth.  The number of fallen soldiers was uncountable; a horrifying sight.</p><p>As the sun rose, the battlefield erupted with the roar of battle.  In the Yan camp, a hilltop provided a panoramic view of the conflict, and the commander’s tent was situated there.  Before the tent, Yu Lang and several other commanders stood gazing east, the bloody dawn illuminating them.  Their expressions were grave as they watched the center of the battlefield.</p><p>Years of warfare had etched lines of iron resolve onto Yu Lang’s face, replacing some of his former scholarly refinement.  He watched the soldiers locked in brutal combat, his anxieties mounting, and his gaze drifted south.  Not far away, a towering peak, even higher than the hill they stood on, offered an even better vantage point—a strategic high ground.  However, ordinary people were forbidden to ascend that mountain.  Everyone knew it was a sacred mountain, home to a newly constructed palace, the residence of a powerful cultivator.  Even on various stone platforms and cliffs, one could sometimes glimpse the cultivator meditating.  Shrouded in mist, their figure appeared ethereal, a picture of otherworldly grace.  The sight always filled the soldiers with awe.</p><p>The enemy camp had a similar location.  Yu Lang's worries weren’t about their cultivators being inferior; quite the opposite, they had won more battles than they'd lost. His concern was the escalating casualties and the seemingly endless fighting.  The central battlefield was like a maelstrom, consuming countless lives, a pit that could never be filled, no matter how much blood was spilled.</p><p>Over the years, Yu Lang had witnessed countless deaths and had grown numb, yet he still felt a pang of anguish.  In his view, much of the bloodshed was meaningless.  The addition of cultivators had not only failed to shorten the war but had, in fact, intensified the casualties. Without the cultivators, he was confident he could launch a final, decisive assault to crush the enemy army, instead of this endless stalemate.</p><p>Indeed, he hadn't expected his command to last this long. He'd assumed that once cultivators became involved, the conflict would inevitably devolve into a battle between them.  There would be cultivator casualties, leading to revenge, escalating from personal grudges to conflicts between sects, and eventually a larger, chaotic war between righteous and evil factions, drawing in more and more individuals and powers. Most conflicts followed this pattern. Once Yuan Ying cultivators intervened, who would care about the common soldiers?  The outcome would be decided by the most powerful, with the mundane world subsequently falling under the victor’s control.</p><p>Yet, reality defied his expectations.  Both sides exhibited remarkable restraint. Aside from the Yuan Ying masters stationed in the central armies to deter attacks, no Golden Core or higher-level cultivators had appeared on the battlefield. Even when cultivators died, the revenge sought by their sects never exceeded the Foundation Establishment level.</p><p>This continued until the final, decisive battle.  Then, powerful cultivators emerged in droves, like mushrooms after a spring rain.  Yu Lang had no idea how many Golden Core and Yuan Ying cultivators were hidden on the mountain.  These cultivators weren't simply observing; they were providing "gifts."</p><p>A faint crimson mist now enveloped the battlefield, accompanied by the clang of gongs.  Both sides had three thousand soldiers. The crimson mist emanated from the Blood Yuan Banners in the hands of the Yan soldiers.  The gong sounds came from the enemy army. The enemy formed a semicircle, with a Foundation Establishment cultivator at the rear wielding a large golden gong. Five hundred soldiers, each holding a small bronze gong, surrounded the cultivator. The sound was deafening.</p><p>These soldiers only struck their gongs; the number of soldiers engaged in direct combat was clearly at a disadvantage.  However, the gong sounds possessed a peculiar power, emitting rings of light that landed on their comrades. The recipients were instantly invigorated, their bodies radiating a bronze glow, like forged iron, unyielding in the face of the dragon-shaped blood energy emanating from the Blood Yuan Banners. Conversely, the Yan forces were disrupted by the sounds, their formations thrown into disarray. This was the pattern of every battle.</p><p>A losing side, three thousand elite soldiers, were either slaughtered or captured, while the cultivators usually managed to escape.</p><p>Both sides offered various treasures and magical skills, yet the victory was decided by the flesh and blood of mortals, countless lives sacrificed.</p><p>Yu Lang wasn't clear about the agreement between the righteous and the wicked sides. He only knew that if this continued, more and more people would die in vain.</p><p>"Again!"</p><p>The large chessboard was divided into smaller ones, and even on the smallest board, there were players and pieces.</p><p>In any game, mortals were merely pawns, manipulated at will.</p><p>This was precisely what Yu Lang loathed!</p><p>He had hoped to bring about change, but now he felt powerless.</p><p>He, the commander, was not a figurehead; he decided on troop deployments and formations. Yet, after every battle, regardless of victory or defeat, Yu Lang felt only sorrow.</p><p>"Can Master change the situation?"</p><p>Yu Lang gazed at the vast sky, pondering silently.</p><p>In his heart, his Master was omnipotent.  He hadn't encountered any danger and, unwavering in his belief, had readily used a bamboo slip.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A roar suddenly erupted on the battlefield.</p><p>The roar, emanating from the Yan soldiers, resembled the dragon's cry of dragon-shaped blood energy, comparable to thunder, shaking the very soul.</p><p>The roar disrupted the drumbeat for a moment. Seizing the fleeting opportunity, the Yan forces surged forward, instantly breaking through the enemy lines.</p><p>'Clang! Clang! Clang!'</p><p>The cultivator frantically beat the drum. Seeing his side increasingly chaotic and unable to regroup, he immediately abandoned his soldiers and vanished in a flash of light.</p><p>He dared not linger; otherwise, if caught by the dragon-shaped blood energy, he would be in grave danger.</p><p>The Yan forces returned victorious, their faces beaming with joy.</p><p>A touch of sadness flashed in Yu Lang's eyes, and he sighed inwardly. Suddenly, he caught sight of a figure.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>He saw his Master, whom he hadn't seen for a long time.</p><p>At that moment, Yu Lang felt an overwhelming mix of sorrow and joy.</p><p>He suddenly wondered if it would have been better if he had chosen, like his senior sister, to return to the peaceful Qingyang Temple.</p><p>"You did well," Qin Sang surveyed the battlefield, offering unstinting praise.</p><p>This was no mere flattery; Yu Lang's achievement as a commander of ten thousand soldiers truly exceeded Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that this disciple had done his utmost.</p><p>Most preciously, Yu Lang, despite the trials he'd faced, hadn't changed his initial aspirations.</p><p>Although Yu Lang's aspirations differed from his own, Qin Sang was still pleased with his disciple for this.</p><p>"Master…"</p><p>Yu Lang's eyes blurred, a multitude of emotions welling up within him.</p><p>The emotions stemmed from his Master's affirmation, and even more from his experiences over the years.</p><p>Just then, the defeated enemy army sent another detachment into the battlefield, challenging them.</p><p>From afar, they saw that all the soldiers wore wooden armor, made of an unknown type of wood. Some parts even had branches and green leaves sprouting from them.</p><p>These men stood in formation, as if rooted to the ground, steady as a rock, impervious to any force.</p><p>"Please, General Qin, instruct us on who should engage them!"</p><p>"Yuan Qings from Mount Yulong requests to fight!"</p><p>…</p><p>One long howl after another rolled out from the Yan camp.</p><p>Yu Lang looked at his Master.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, and a gentle breeze blew towards the enemy formation.  Immediately, cracking sounds were heard.</p><p>To the horror of the three thousand soldiers, cracks appeared in their armor, shattering into pieces and falling from their bodies.</p><p>The feeling of being firmly rooted to the earth vanished.  They felt lightheaded and were flung backward, tumbling and screaming.</p><p>"Who dares to be so presumptuous!"</p><p>"Who are you?!"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's action immediately drew angry shouts, some even from the southern mountains.</p><p>The next moment, figures flew out from the mountains.</p><p>In an instant, hundreds of people filled the sky above the battlefield, mostly Golden Core cultivators, but also several Yuan Ying Ancestors with profound auras.</p><p>All eyes focused on this scene.</p><p>Yu Lang's heart trembled, but with his Master beside him, he felt reassured and fearless.</p><p>"Who are you?!"</p><p>Across the battlefield, a middle-aged man stepped forward from the crowd.</p><p>He had an ordinary appearance, a pale complexion, and a thin frame; he looked like a convalescing patient.</p><p>Yet, the others showed respectful expressions upon seeing him, willingly giving way.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng?"</p><p>A surprised voice arose from the south; someone recognized Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways, recognizing Yin Heqian.  She nodded in acknowledgement, then turned to the middle-aged man, rising into the air with a slight smile. "With powerful cultivators from both sides present, why this delay? When will the battle finally begin? I have little patience and can't wait any longer. Which of you will fight me?"</p><p>The middle-aged man frowned, looking towards the Kwong Clan ancestor, his gaze seeming to ask for an explanation.</p><p>The Kwong Clan ancestor summoned Yin Heqian to his side, briefly questioned him, and then thoughtfully said, "This is General Qin's master, Qingfeng Daozhang? Indeed, he has an extraordinary bearing…"</p><p>He flashed to Qin Sang's side, bowing. "I am Kwong Wujiang, I greet the Daozhang."</p><p>"Daoist Kwong is courteous."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang showed no arrogance, the Kwong Clan ancestor's expression softened slightly.  He gestured towards the southern mountain. "We did not know of the Daozhang's arrival and failed to greet you properly. We have brought some fine tea and spirits from the mountain gate. Would the Daozhang grace us with your presence?"</p><p>"Not yet!"</p><p>Qin Sang waved a hand. "We'll drink tea after we capture these demons."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The Kwong Clan ancestor frowned.</p><p>Qin Sang curiously asked, "Daoist Kwong, is there some difficulty? Or are these demons so powerful that you are afraid to fight?"</p><p>At these words, the Kwong Clan ancestor inwardly fumed, but suppressed his anger. "Please, Daozhang, come to South Mountain; I will explain."</p><p>"No need for such trouble. Even if there's an unparalleled demon, I'll face them and learn their skills! Since you're unwilling to come out, I'll go to you!"</p><p>The last sentence was shouted towards the opposing side.</p><p>Before the words had left her mouth, a sword light shot from Qin Sang's sleeve—not the Grey Warbler Sword, but a randomly chosen spiritual sword.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The sword sang clearly. Before anyone could react, it struck towards the middle-aged man.</p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p>The middle-aged man was startled and enraged. He slapped his waist, sending a thin grey-white rope flying out.  The rope was crystalline, like a long tendon, but not of ox or dragon; it was woven from strands of human tendons, called the Soul Tendon.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Soul Tendon sprang out, swirling powerfully, emitting ghostly cries, like thousands of vengeful spirits, chilling the soul.</p><p>Just as the Soul Tendon was about to wrap around the spiritual sword, without any visible movement from Qin Sang, the sword light trembled, suddenly splitting into ten, then continuously dividing, until in an instant, countless sword lights filled the air.</p><p>The middle-aged man felt a blur, then found himself surrounded by sword light, everywhere.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>The middle-aged man was greatly alarmed, hastily recalling the Soul Tendon, but it was too late. All the sword lights vanished from his sight.</p><p>He knew, however, that they hadn't disappeared; he simply couldn't see them.  There was only one possibility: he had fallen into a sword array!</p><p>This array was the Xuanji Sword Array Qin Sang had learned at the Wuxiang Immortal Gate, specializing in illusory sword techniques.</p><p>In a single encounter, he was trapped.</p><p>The others were stunned.  The middle-aged man was a top expert at the middle stage of the Nascent Soul Realm, known as the number one below the late stage of the Nascent Soul Realm, yet he wasn't a match for a single move.  What exactly was Qingfeng Daozhang's background?</p><p>"Big Brother!"</p><p>A young man cried out, quickly summoning a demonic blade and slashing towards Qin Sang's head.  The blade's energy was incredibly sharp.</p><p>But Qin Sang remained motionless, glancing at the Kwong Clan ancestor. "Daoist Kwong, will you not act?"</p><p>"I…"</p><p>The Kwong Clan ancestor didn't know what to do.</p><p>The righteous and demonic paths had no connection to Yun Du Tian or Luohun Abyss, but out of fear of their overwhelming power, they had to comply. Neither side wanted to fight to the death for the two major factions' conflict, so they made a gentleman's agreement to use ordinary people as pawns to determine the victor.  This allowed them to avoid excessive casualties.  Of course, this was contingent on the satisfaction of the two major factions; otherwise, they would have to fight themselves. This was also a test of the two great factions' attitudes.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a troublemaker appeared.  Qingfeng Daozhang was clearly on their side, and the Kwong Clan ancestor couldn't stand idly by while she was attacked. He had to summon his spiritual sword to block the demonic blade.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled knowingly, her sword techniques changing rapidly.</p><p>In the eyes of the onlookers, the interior of the sword array was chaotic; no one knew what was happening inside. Then, the sword lights converged, shooting back.  Within the sword light, a figure was clearly wrapped.</p><p>The middle-aged man's eyes were wide, his expression filled with terror. He had lost his ability to resist, becoming a prisoner!</p><p>Instantly, an uproar erupted.  Even the righteous cultivators were stunned. Only after hearing Qin Sang shout, "What are you waiting for?", did they hesitantly charge forward.</p><p>The melee erupted unexpectedly.  Soon,遁光 from all directions shot towards them, their auras surpassing even the middle-aged man, all late-stage Nascent Soul experts and various clan ancestors. Seeing the situation spiraling out of control, they were all furious.</p><p>Then, a shocking scene unfolded: the demonic cultivators were no match for Qingfeng Daozhang, one after another falling in defeat.</p><p>Qin Sang stood suspended in the air, gazing across the distance at a mountain a hundred miles away.  On the mountain, Yun Xianshi and the cloaked figure watched this scene, their expressions stiff.</p><p>Since they wanted to drag her into this, she would show them what she could do! This was not just about this battle. Qin Sang intended to disrupt the game, even drawing out the two Nascent Void Ancestors!</p>
