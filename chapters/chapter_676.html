Chapter 668: An Attempt


Seeing Qin Sang's resolve, Ran Luo didn't push the matter, but her attitude became noticeably more cordial.  It seemed that skilled refiners and alchemists were just as scarce in Canglang Sea as they were in Xiaohan Region.
"One month from now, Daoist Qin, please arrive promptly at Pingbo Harbor. It's crucial you don't miss the appointed time.  There are also a few points I need to clarify. First, as you are not yet a retainer of our Chamber of Commerce, we must charge a fee for our services. This fee is solely to ensure your safety during your journey. Upon arrival at Wushen Mountain, the teleportation costs will be your own responsibility..."
Ran Luo's reminders were all standard procedure.

Qin Sang agreed to everything, arranged to meet Ran Luo in a month, and then inquired about Soul-Guiding Grass and other items at the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce, but to no avail.  He then took his leave.
With ample time remaining, Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to leave. He visited several other trading companies, but still couldn't find what he needed.

The next morning, Qin Sang left the city, retrieved the black coffin containing Du Han's body, and flew south towards the Black Gold Mountains.
The cartographic map he possessed meticulously marked all the sects near the Black Gold Mountains. To avoid them, Qin Sang spent nine days traveling to his destination.
From afar, he saw a massive dark silhouette sprawling across the horizon, resembling an ancient black gold beast.

The Black Gold Mountains were synonymous with danger and evil in the eyes of the local Wu tribe.  Rumors of rogue cultivators lurking within kept even local cultivators with insufficient power from venturing into the mountains.
Qin Sang's map marked an approximate location. The ravine wasn't deep within the Black Gold Mountains, but he cautiously summoned the Flying Night Devil.

Man and corpse stealthily infiltrated the mountains, traversing peaks and valleys until they finally neared the ravine.
Before even locating the Earthly Yin energy, Qin Sang encountered a familiar sight: withered vegetation, a complete absence of birds and animals. The closer he got, the more severe it became, until finally, the land was barren, the ground stained a strange black by some unknown substance, the air thick with death.
It was almost identical to the area around the Earth Sinkhole.

Qin Sang's face lit up with excitement. He ordered the Flying Night Devil to increase its speed. Soon, they saw wisps of black energy rising in the distance, and the air grew colder.
Just then, Qin Sang abruptly stopped, sensing the presence of living beings ahead. Their auras were weak, none exceeding the Foundation Establishment stage.

After a moment's thought, Qin Sang had the Flying Night Devil hide the coffin and concealed their presence as they approached. They discovered a cave dwelling at the edge of the ravine, occupied by only three cultivators. They appeared to be disciples from a local sect, sent to monitor the changes in the ravine's energy.
There were warning wards around the ravine as well, but these posed no challenge to Qin Sang.

Qin Sang only needed the Yin energy to refine corpses and had no desire to interact with the local factions. He and the Flying Night Devil bypassed the wards. The three cultivators in the cave remained engrossed in their cultivation, completely unaware of the intruders slipping into the depths of the ravine.
The ravine wasn't large, and the Earthly Yin energy was far less abundant than in the Earth Sinkhole, but it was sufficient for refining corpses.

Finding a protruding rock, Qin Sang looked down at the churning Yin energy below, curious about its origins and what lay beneath.
Despite his increased cultivation, he still dared not enter the Yin energy rashly.

After setting up a protective formation, Qin Sang opened the black coffin, pulled out Du Han, and summoned Du Xian from the Corpse Puppet Pouch.
He planned to apply the restrictions of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* to Du Han first. If that failed, he would use Du Han's Gold Core and Du Xian's body to create a new Flying Night Devil.
Du Han's cultivation was suppressed by Qin Sang, leaving him powerless to resist.

Looking at Du Han, Qin Sang fell into deep thought, remaining motionless for a long time.
Having immersed himself in the Dao of Corpses for many years, he had his own insights into corpse refinement, but he was far from being able to create his own corpse refinement technique.
Only individuals with exceptional talent could create their own cultivation methods and divine abilities.

He could only make minor modifications to the existing *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*.  Hope was slim, but he had to try before giving up.
Qin Sang carefully reviewed the manual in his mind, then without hesitation, channeled his true essence and struck Du Han with the first corpse refinement restriction.
Initially, it went smoothly, but when the restrictions began to merge and invade Du Han's body, Qin Sang encountered unprecedented resistance.

Immediately afterward, Du Han's true essence erupted. Before Qin Sang could react, the corpse refinement restrictions were shattered, and Du Han was awakened by the intense pain.
Ignoring Du Han's venomous glare, Qin Sang made several more attempts, finally confirming that the living corpse restrictions in the first half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* were indeed ineffective on Core Formation cultivators.

Qin Sang hadn't given up yet. He took out a Heavenly Corpse Talisman and, under Du Han's terrified gaze, pressed it into his Purple Palace to test whether it could seal a Core Formation cultivator's Nascent Soul.
Unexpectedly, as soon as the talisman touched Du Han's Nascent Soul, before Qin Sang could complete the restriction, it suddenly exploded.
Du Han, whose Nascent Soul was defenseless due to Qin Sang's suppression, screamed as the explosion ripped through it. His aura rapidly dissipated, on the verge of complete soul destruction.

Qin Sang's expression changed. He acted swiftly, using Soul Searching on Du Han's fragmented soul in the few remaining moments before he expired.
"It seems without the latter half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, my path in the Dao of Corpses has reached its end," Qin Sang muttered with a wry smile, clutching Du Han's Gold Core. "Other corpse refinement techniques are too time-consuming. I need to prioritize my own cultivation and not waste time on these things.  Cultivating my natal insect gu will also require a significant portion of my energy. I must let go of what needs to be let go."

He could refine Du Han's body into a corpse using other sects' techniques, but the result would be too weak. Moreover, the connection to the Li Wu Palace posed a risk of exposure, making it not worth the gamble.
Qin Sang kicked Du Han's corpse into the abyss, where it was quickly swallowed by the Earthly Yin energy, perfectly destroying all traces.
He then began the familiar process of refining Du Xian into a living corpse.

Du Xian's physical body.
Du Han's Gold Core.
If all went well, he would have another Flying Night Devil.
Having refined himself into a Flying Night Devil, Qin Sang was intimately familiar with the technique.  However, he remained cautious. He had only one Heavenly Corpse Talisman left and couldn't afford to waste it.
The formation concealed all fluctuations within the ravine, leaving the three cultivators in the cave oblivious to what transpired below.

Three days later, two dark figures flanked Qin Sang.
*Bang!*
The two Flying Night Devils simultaneously threw punches at each other.
Yu Hua merely shuddered slightly, while Du Xian was flung back several meters before regaining his footing.
"Even though newly refined, Du Xian's strength is clearly inferior to Yu Hua's.  However, it's more than enough for combat," Qin Sang murmured, storing both Flying Night Devils in the Corpse Puppet Pouch to slowly nurture them.
