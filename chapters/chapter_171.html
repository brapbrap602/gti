Chapter 164: Instant Kill

"I don’t dare say I know anything, but I have indeed seen the words ‘Heavenly Corpse Sect’ in an ancient book, which only gave a brief description of the sect."

Old Man Baiyun briefly summarized the original text and explained, "The Heavenly Corpse Sect was a demonic sect from long ago. It wasn’t a major demonic sect and was only somewhat renowned during that time. Its disciples were skilled at refining corpses, and their corpse-refining methods were extremely unique. They didn’t use yin energy but instead utilized the evil energy of the earth. The corpses they refined had bodies that were stronger than those refined using other corpse techniques, which was why the Heavenly Corpse Sect had many branch altars established in places with dense evil energy for their disciples to refine corpses. Later, for unknown reasons, the sect vanished without a trace, and their corpse-refining methods were lost as well. Initially, I took it with a grain of salt and thought of it as a mere story, but after seeing this Blackiron Token and these unique Evil Corpses, I realized that the words written in the ancient book held some truth. It seems like the Heavenly Corpse Sect must have provoked a formidable enemy. Not only was their lineage severed, but their base was also sealed."

Upon hearing the story of the Heavenly Corpse Sect, Qin Sang suddenly understood. He looked down at the ashes on the ground and muttered to himself, "No wonder there are such strange Evil Corpses." He then asked, "Fellow Daoist Baiyun, do you know if this place is a branch altar or the headquarters of the Heavenly Corpse Sect? Do you think there might be Evil Corpses here that can rival the Sky Flying Yaksha?"

Old Man Baiyun shook his head and said, "This shouldn’t be the headquarters. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be so many low-level zombies on the periphery. The book states that the Sect Master of the Heavenly Corpse Sect at that time was only a Golden Core cultivator. Their branch altars were always managed by Foundation Establishment cultivators, so at most there might be stronger Evil Corpses, but it’s unlikely that there’s a Sky Flying Yaksha here."

After hearing this, the tension in everyone’s hearts eased a little.

After all, corpses were just lifeless things. Even without cultivators controlling them, the strength of Evil Corpses was limited. With so many of them working together, even if they couldn’t defeat the Evil Corpses, they would be able to escape easily.

The Sky Flying Yaksha was different. It was a powerful Evil Corpse comparable to a Golden Core cultivator. Its corpse poison was fierce, and it was proficient in the Five Elements Escape Technique, making it elusive. Even if there were more Foundation Establishment cultivators, they wouldn’t be able to defeat it together.

Wu Yuesheng frowned and said with some disappointment, "Is it just a branch altar? I’m afraid there won’t be any treasures there. It seems like we made this trip for nothing."

Qin Sang glanced at Wu Yuesheng.

Old Man Baiyun persuaded, "Even if there were a treasure vault, it would have definitely been emptied already. We almost got consumed by the evil energy, and it’s already very lucky that we managed to escape unharmed. Whether we made the trip for nothing or not doesn’t matter. Fellow Daoist Qingting and Fellow Daoist Yu spent years preparing and even carefully prepared tools to break the formations. They wasted more than us."

After Old Man Baiyun said this, everyone seemed to be less disappointed.

As they spoke, the restrictions on the Blackiron Heavy Gate were broken, revealing a small gap. After the four of them checked to make sure that there were no ambushes behind it, they entered one after another.

Upon arriving here, the four of them were slightly surprised. The spiritual energy here was several times denser than before, and it was already comparable to the caves that the Shaohua Mountain Sect provided to its Foundation Establishment disciples.

Old Man Baiyun and the Liu brothers were considered somewhat renowned figures among rogue cultivators. Their caves were also inferior to this place.

"It seems like we’re almost at the core of the branch altar. Everyone, be careful," Old Man Baiyun reminded them and continued, "Let Liu Jiang and me lead the way to prevent any surprise attacks from Evil Corpses."

Without waiting for Wu Yuesheng to speak, Qin Sang spoke up, "I’ll take the rear. Senior Brother Wu, help Fellow Daoist Baiyun take care of Fellow Daoist Liu. The cultivators who were able to have caves here must have been powerful, and their Evil Corpses shouldn’t be underestimated. Two people will be more reliable."

He didn’t feel reassured leaving his back to Wu Yuesheng and would rather shoulder the danger from behind himself.

Wu Yuesheng didn’t suspect anything and agreed.

After finalizing the formation, the four of them set off. The stone path was narrow. Old Man Baiyun and Liu Jiang walked in front, with Wu Yuesheng following slightly behind them. They protected Liu Jiang from both the front and the back, while Qin Sang walked at the very end.

As Wu Yuesheng insisted, they slowed down and carefully checked every stone chamber they came across. It seemed that the number of cultivators who were qualified to open up caves here was limited, as there weren’t many stone chambers, so they didn’t waste much time.

Much to their surprise, they didn’t encounter a single Evil Corpse on their way.

The stone path gradually sloped downward, and they continued to search without any results. Wu Yuesheng gradually became impatient and asked, "Fellow Daoist Liu, why haven’t we found the others yet? Can you really sense their location?"

Liu Jiang didn’t dare refute him and could only explain in a low voice.

Old Man Baiyun helped smooth things over, "Fellow Daoist Wu, don’t worry. I can vouch for them. These brothers do have a spiritual connection. As their cultivations improve, this connection will only grow stronger. I believe that this place is just too complex and we haven’t yet…"

Halfway through his sentence, Old Man Baiyun suddenly paused, raised his head abruptly, and looked deep into the stone path. His brow creased tightly. As the others wondered to themselves, Old Man Baiyun’s expression changed drastically, and he suddenly let out a loud roar.

"Be careful!"

Before he could finish his words, a dark shadow flashed out of nowhere and darted toward them. It moved so fast that they couldn't make out its features, only catching a glimpse of a black figure lunging at Baiyun Hermit.

In the nick of time, Baiyun Hermit hastily activated his cloth collector magic weapon, Boundless Sky Pocket, and held it before him. Suddenly, a ghostly claw materialized out of thin air and slammed onto the Boundless Sky Pocket.

BAM!

The Boundless Sky Pocket protected him just in time, sparing Baiyun Hermit from injury, but the immense force sent him flying backward. He crashed into the stone wall with a groan.

Qin Sang was taken aback by the sight. He quickly summoned the Five Elements Sword Breaker and turned it around. Immediately after, he heard Liu Jiang's horrified scream from ahead. He saw Liu Jiang levitate eerily and vanish into the depths of the stone path in a flash.

In a brief moment, Qin Sang noticed a ghostly face peeking out from over Liu Jiang's shoulder. It stared at them with a sinister grin, its body clinging tightly to Liu Jiang as it disappeared with him.

"Ghoul! Quickly, we must save Fellow Daoist Liu!"

Baiyun Hermit had the clearest view from the front.

The unexpected turn of events had caught him off guard. He had only managed to activate Boundless Sky Pocket to protect himself, allowing Liu Jiang to fall into the ghoul's grasp. Filled with regret, he let out a cry and rushed to the rescue.

Qin Sang exchanged a glance with Wu Yuesheng. Without hesitation, they unleashed their full speed and followed close behind.

Although the ghoul possessed uncanny abilities and blinding speed, abducting Liu Jiang within an instant, they had no choice but to confront it. The Earth Fiend Qi was hot on their heels, and retreat was not an option. They had to join forces to eliminate the ghoul or find an escape route ahead.

Liu Jiang's life or death was unknown. If anything were to happen to Baiyun Hermit as well, they would be in an even more desperate situation.

As Qin Sang pursued the ghoul, he couldn't help but be shaken by the horrifying encounter.

The ghouls they had encountered before were powerful, but none had been as formidable as this one. Liu Jiang's Iron Lotus had remained deployed the entire time, and he had been protected by both Baiyun Hermit and Wu Yuesheng. Yet, he had been dragged away by the ghoul without putting up a fight.

What disturbed Qin Sang the most was the sinister smile he had seen on the ghoul's face as it vanished.

He had seen it clearly, and it was certainly not an illusion.
