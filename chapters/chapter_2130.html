<h1>Chapter 2120 Mutual Probing</h1><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying, inseparable as shadows, were masters of a combined attack secret technique. They had intended to surprise the enemy with it, but being forced to call for help before even having a chance to unleash it was completely unforeseen.</p><p>The enemy's true strength remained unknown. Breaking the altar formation couldn't rely solely on these peak experts; it also required the cooperation of Lu Wang's subordinates.  In times of necessity, these lower-ranked cultivators would be needed to scout the way, lest the peak experts themselves become the pathfinders.</p><p>The Jiu Gui Division's swift annihilation was unacceptable and a significant blow to morale.</p><p>What they were contending for now wasn't the gain or loss of a single battle. Even if it meant losing face, Shi Mu had to swallow this bitter pill.</p><p>At the same moment, Lu Gan felt a tremor in his heart, secretly astonished.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying were quite renowned within the Si You Clan. Though both were at the early stage of the Empty Realm Second Layer, when they joined forces, even he wouldn't dare to take them lightly.</p><p>How long had they been inside?</p><p>Relying on the Undetermined Eight Extremes Diagram, Lu Gan could pinpoint Shi Mu and the others' location but remained clueless about what they had encountered, his heart filled with doubt.</p><p>However, Lu Gan vaguely sensed unusual fluctuations emanating from the depths of the Thunder Marsh, which was likely the reason for Shi Mu's sudden plea for help.</p><p>Simultaneously with Shi Mu's call for aid, Lu Gan also perceived the rapidly diminishing auras of the Jiu Gui Division cultivators, indicating that the situation might be even more critical than imagined.</p><p>Lu Gan didn't hesitate, immediately activating the Undetermined Eight Extremes Diagram.</p><p>Fortunately, the power of the Undetermined Eight Extremes Diagram didn't resist him in the slightest, obeying his will like an extension of his own body.</p><p>Within the Thunder Marsh, Shi Mu, Shi Ying, and the Jiu Gui Division cultivators all flickered with a profound yellow light, as if an invisible thread connected them to the Undetermined Eight Extremes Diagram.</p><p>In the next instant, the profound yellow light erupted. Countless dazzling orbs of light emerged within the Thunder Marsh, rivaling the brilliance of the lightning itself.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he abruptly looked towards the area outside the Thunder Marsh.</p><p>At the same time, Thunder Lords appeared in the sky, each one enveloped in lightning, exuding immense power.  Their weapons pointed downwards in unison, as Heavenly Retribution descended!</p><p>"Crack! Boom!"</p><p>Torrents of lightning, capable of destroying heaven and earth, poured down.</p><p>Many Jiu Gui Division cultivators were obliterated by the Heavenly Retribution before they could even cry out, vanishing into thin air.</p><p>In that single moment, countless lives were lost.</p><p>But at the same instant, a pillar of light pierced through the sky, penetrating the Thunder Marsh, carrying violent fluctuations as it crashed down.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Like a colossal hammer, it caused heaven and earth to tremble.</p><p>The Thunder Lords' figures wavered, their weapons unsteady, causing the lightning to pause for a fleeting moment.</p><p>In an instant, the profound yellow light on everyone merged with this pillar of light, then began to recede. Everyone scattered throughout the marsh, struggling to hold on, was swept up by the tide of light and retreated.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying also retreated with the others, but they remained vigilant against Qin Sang, not daring to relax.</p><p>"Crackle! Rumble..."</p><p>"Where do you demons think you're going?!"</p><p>The sound of thunder and furious shouts were incessant.</p><p>After a brief moment of chaos, the Thunder Lords swiftly attacked, unleashing even more ferocious lightning bolts, continuing to reap lives.</p><p>Unfortunately, the enemy retreated too quickly; they couldn't keep them all within the marsh.</p><p>After repelling the two companion beasts, Qin Sang's main body also gave up the pursuit, watching Shi Mu and the others escape the Thunder Marsh.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying led the remnants of the Jiu Gui Division back to the Undetermined Eight Extremes Diagram, their appearance disheveled.  A rough count revealed that the Jiu Gui Division had lost nearly half its members in that short time.</p><p>Shi Mu's face was ashen. One wrong move, and the whole game was lost. This defeat was entirely due to his mistaken strategy, giving the enemy an opportunity to deliver a resounding slap to his face.</p><p>Lu Wang and the others came out of their palanquin to greet them.</p><p>Seeing the Jiu Gui Division's惨状, Lu Wang felt a pang of sorrow in his heart, but his expression remained unchanged, asking with apparent concern, "Are the two fellow Daoists unharmed?"</p><p>Shi Mu's face flushed with shame as he bowed and sighed, "I underestimated the opponent, leading to heavy losses for the Jiu Gui Division. I have failed in my duty!"</p><p>"You all, go and heal your injuries quickly!"</p><p>Lu Wang dismissed the Jiu Gui Division with a stern voice, then turned to Shi Mu and Shi Ying with a gentle expression. "Victory and defeat are common in warfare. The two fellow Daoists are the pillars of our strength. It's good that you're unharmed! What discoveries have you made this time?"</p><p>Under everyone's gaze, Shi Mu could only recount everything that happened after they entered the Thunder Marsh.</p><p>"Oh? That True Person Qin personally took action in the first round?"</p><p>As expected, this was what everyone was most concerned about. However, it being only the first round didn't reveal much.</p><p>Then, everyone started discussing and analyzing Shi Mu and the others' encounter.</p><p>"The authenticity of those Thunder Lords is uncertain. It sounds like a Thunder Dao formation. It seems the first trial is to break this formation."</p><p>"Indeed. We should invite fellow Daoists who are proficient in this Dao to take action."</p><p>"The next fellow Daoists to enter the formation must be cautious.  The Thunder Lords' display may not represent their true strength.  It's possible they deliberately let people escape after interrupting their attacks with the Undetermined Eight Extremes Diagram. First, they confuse us, and then they'll suddenly unleash their full power later, aiming for greater results!"</p><p>At this moment, the Grand Offering spoke, "Do the two fellow Daoists remember the locations of the Thunder Lords during their appearances and the pattern of their lightning strikes?  Perhaps you could depict them, and we can comprehend them together, possibly finding the key to this formation."</p><p>"We remember!"</p><p>Shi Mu nodded, channeling his True Essence, and recreated what he had witnessed before everyone as instructed.</p><p>Within the Thunder Marsh.</p><p>Qin Sang watched as Shi Mu and the others fled back to land. His gaze passed over them, fixating on the depths of the land, where verdant mountains resembled dark eyebrows and banners lined up like a forest.</p><p>They were probing him, but wasn't he also probing them, using this method to investigate their background?</p><p>Only forcing out a profound yellow light left Qin Sang somewhat disappointed. The opponent had used the profound yellow light to forcefully break through the formation and take their people away, but apart from that, they hadn't shown any other changes.</p><p>That piece of land definitely wouldn't be so simple. Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry, ordering the Thunder Lords to conceal themselves within the Thunder Marsh, continuing to wait for the second wave of intruders.</p><p>The opponents were more patient than Qin Sang had anticipated.  Several days passed in silence before cultivators left the land and flew towards the Thunder Marsh. This time, the number was similar to before, but besides Shi Mu and Shi Ying, there was another expert whose cultivation was comparable to theirs.</p><p>And they had changed their strategy, no longer rashly advancing. The cultivators gathered together, with the three experts positioned at three different directions, cautiously pushing forward.</p><p>Soon, Shi Mu and the others returned to the location where they had fled before, immediately coming under fierce attack.</p><p>Thunder Lords filled the sky, lightning flashing and thunder roaring, frantically striking at everyone.</p><p>Hidden in the shadows, Qin Sang observed coldly, seeing the enemy completely abandon their offense, allowing themselves to be struck by lightning, condensing into a single mass, a light barrier above their heads, resembling a turtle shell.</p><p>After waiting for a while, seeing no opportunity, Qin Sang decided to personally take action.</p><p>Shi Mu and the other two had remained vigilant. The moment Qin Sang made his move, they detected it.</p><p>"Careful!"</p><p>The three had already discussed their countermeasures. Shi Mu and Shi Ying immediately stepped forward, leaving the last expert to maintain the formation.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang clashed with Shi Mu and Shi Ying.</p><p>At the same time, the other expert began to change the formation, attempting to counterattack.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the other battlefield and said indifferently, "Do the two fellow Daoists think you can stop this poor Daoist?"</p><p>"We only wish to experience True Person Qin's divine abilities!"</p><p>Shi Mu said in a deep voice.</p><p>Qin Sang's tone shifted, advising, "If you wish to spar, this poor Daoist is always willing to oblige. You two aren't the Lu family's slaves. Why wade into these muddy waters?  Wouldn't it be a pity to lose your lives here?"</p><p>Shi Mu shook his head. "We are not doing this for the Lu family, but because we are convinced by the Grand Offering and willingly serve him.  Lu Wang has the Young Master and the Grand Offering by his side, experts abound. Compared to us, True Person is the one at a disadvantage."</p><p>Saying this, he glanced behind Qin Sang, "True Person is also an outsider. Why interfere in the Si You Clan's affairs? Your clansmen were originally innocent, yet because of True Person's insistence, they are now facing a life-or-death crisis. As long as True Person is willing to hand over the remnants of the Si family, Lu Wang will surely not make things difficult for you. He will even persuade Clan Leader Min Zhuo to negotiate peace with you. Why not choose this amicable solution?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, "Fellow Daoist isn't a subordinate of Lu Wang, so how can you know Lu Wang's thoughts?  This poor Daoist is not one to go back on his word. Since Fellow Daoist insists on this path, don't blame this poor Daoist for showing no mercy!"</p><p>As they exchanged words, their attacks didn't relent but became even more fierce.</p><p>Clad in the Bright Mountain Armor, wielding the spirit tablet, Qin Sang relied on the Great Vajra Wheel Seal to fight against the two, not losing any ground.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying exchanged a glance. Their six companion beasts simultaneously vanished, their roars echoing continuously.</p><p>Simultaneously, each of them took out a treasure that looked like a jade bracelet cut in half, each holding one half.</p><p>They threw these treasures out, and with a 'snap,' they combined in mid-air and then vanished, disappearing along with their companion beasts.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang ordered the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to use its Heaven's Eye divine ability.  However, in the butterfly's vision, the six companion beasts were enveloped in a faint white light, their figures continuing to fade until they disappeared completely.</p><p>This peculiar scene made Qin Sang realize that these six companion beasts weren't merely cloaked in invisibility, but were employing a secret technique, aided by that treasure, transforming into a special state undetectable by conventional means.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't act rashly, his heart filled with vigilance. In the next moment, he felt a gust of sinister wind approaching from his left, a companion beast's sharp claw suddenly materializing.</p><p>The claw had four sharp talons, each as sharp as a sword or blade, appearing silently and abruptly. Behind the claw was a void, as if the companion beast was about to leap out from it. Before it even fully emerged, an astonishing aura pressed down upon him.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sharp intent just inches away. With a thought, he slammed the spirit tablet forward.</p><p>The spirit tablet carried immense force, causing the claw to momentarily pause.</p><p>But this was only the beginning of the enemy's attack.  As Qin Sang struck, several voids appeared in succession in the surrounding space, almost encircling him, unleashing a series of ferocious attacks.</p><p>At this moment, demons danced wildly around Qin Sang, ice and fire clashed, the scene utter chaos, yet the attacks didn't conflict with each other, their target solely Qin Sang!</p><p>The Great Vajra Wheel Seal granted Qin Sang top-tier combat instincts. Even facing this siege, he wasn't afraid. However, the enemies were all Empty Realm Second Layer experts, and he didn't want to be trapped in their siege and lose the initiative. He immediately flapped his phoenix wings, a bolt of azure lightning flashing with uncanny speed and trajectory, weaving through the companion beasts with several turns, escaping their encirclement without a scratch.</p><p>Breaking free, Qin Sang charged straight for the two main bodies.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying remained calm, with no visible movements.  In front of Qin Sang's path, more voids emerged. The six companion beasts lined up, forming a solid wall, blocking the two.</p><p>Looking behind him, the void had returned to normal, the openings vanished, the six companion beasts seemingly capable of teleportation.</p><p>With roars, the companion beasts lunged fiercely.</p><p>Qin Sang could only abandon his assault, the lightning arc shifting, dodging their sharp edges. Unexpectedly, the six companion beasts vanished once more, reappearing beside him.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang continuously activated his escape techniques, constantly changing directions, yet he still couldn't shake off these six companion beasts.</p><p>They were like phantoms, always appearing where Qin Sang was most vulnerable, their attacks exceptionally fierce.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying stood outside the battlefield, watching Qin Sang grapple with the companion beasts.  It wasn't that their main bodies didn't want to intervene, but manipulating the companion beasts and controlling the treasure already occupied most of their focus.</p><p>At this moment, they secretly rejoiced. Qin Sang was trying various methods to escape the siege, unaware that the real danger was gradually approaching!</p><p>Every time the six companion beasts appeared, the treasure's power grew stronger, until it completely sealed the battlefield, preventing any escape, no matter how sophisticated the technique!</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, Qin Sang had anticipated this. Moreover, during his exchanges with the companion beasts, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had already noticed some clues.</p><p>An invisible force permeated the surroundings, like a dark cloud shrouding the battlefield.  Each time the companion beasts disappeared, they merged into this dark cloud, rendering them invisible even to the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>However, now that the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had detected even the dark cloud itself, these companion beasts couldn't remain hidden any longer!</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang formulated a countermeasure.</p><p>He feigned being helpless against these companion beasts, secretly expanding his movement range, continuously appearing in every corner of the battlefield, darting and weaving.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying, holding the advantage, remained cautious, knowing Qin Sang still had hidden cards.</p><p>Surprisingly, Qin Sang continued to fly around, seemingly at a loss.</p><p>After a while, Shi Mu frowned, a sense of unease rising in his heart.  His gaze swept over Qin Sang's previous flight path, and a flash of inspiration struck him.</p><p>Almost at the same moment, Shi Ying exclaimed, "Not good!"</p><p>Qin Sang's flight path resembled a chaotic web. Every clash with the companion beasts left residual energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's speed was too fast. Those energies hadn't yet dissipated, and now they were scattered across the battlefield.</p><p>A single trace of residual energy was insignificant, but connected together, they were all subtly positioned at crucial nodes.</p><p>And these nodes were precisely what they had been painstakingly concealing. This meant that their secrets had already been seen through by Qin Sang!</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Qin Sang appeared once again, the spirit tablet hanging naturally in his hand.  As Shi Mu and Shi Ying watched in shock, a smile appeared on his face, and he tapped the spirit tablet heavily.</p><p>Boom!  An astonishing force erupted from the void, like a tsunami, engulfing the entire battlefield.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>A ball of white light popped out of thin air. The treasure was forced out, and the two hurriedly reached out, hastily retrieving it.</p><p>The six companion beasts appeared, their forms distorted, unable to hide any longer.</p><p>When it rains, it pours.</p><p>As they faltered, thunder rumbled on the other battlefield, accompanied by faint cries of pain.</p><p>Their hearts lurched again, and they hurriedly looked over, discovering that the Thunder Lords' appearances had drastically changed, displaying even greater power than before!</p><p>This makes up for yesterday's chapter. Today's will be a bit later.</p><p>Also, Dong Ge is awesome!</p>
