<h1>Chapter 1770: The Azure Bird Dharma Form</h1><p>The valley was silent.</p><p>The starlight, no longer converging on a single point, scattered and flowed within Star Valley, though noticeably thinner than before.</p><p>This went on for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, motionless.</p><p>His blood energy subsided, but his body still throbbed restlessly, as if he couldn't control his newfound power.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was introspecting, carefully experiencing the changes brought about by his physical breakthrough.</p><p>It was an unprecedented sensation. Before the breakthrough, he could clearly perceive every beat of his flesh, blood, and marrow. Now, these beats had transformed into a unique rhythm, coalescing into a vital essence.</p><p>This essence was incredibly powerful, brimming with boundless life force. It flowed throughout his body, perfectly unified, forging a solid foundation.</p><p>With this foundation, he was impervious to evil techniques, a cornerstone for his existence.</p><p>He stood in this world, unyielding even if cultivators of the same level invoked the power of heaven and earth.</p><p>Let the winds blow from all directions; I remain unshaken!</p><p>Simultaneously, the acupoints on his body were "breathing," each seeming to contain a celestial rainbow bridge.  The rhythm within the essence resonated with the external world, allowing him to directly absorb and replenish the vital essence with ambient energy to a certain extent.</p><p>As long as this essence remained, even if his body suffered severe injuries, it could heal extremely quickly, except for some vital areas.</p><p>In essence, Qin Sang's physical body now possessed aspects of an immortal body.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, his gaze sharp, his five senses heightened.</p><p>His primordial spirit, cultivation, and body had undergone three transformations, each enhancing his spiritual perception.  Few of his peers could match him.</p><p>He raised his right arm, looking down at his hand, silently pondering.  He knew he could shatter his hand into dust and easily regenerate it.</p><p>Though confident, Qin Sang wouldn't self-harm needlessly. He continued to contemplate, gaining further insights.</p><p>He looked at his clenched right fist.</p><p>The fist appeared normal, but only Qin Sang knew he was concentrating his internal essence at his fingertips. If an enemy stood before him, a single punch would unleash all his power at one point, causing devastating damage!</p><p>Qin Sang could adapt, using his fists, feet, elbows, shoulders, or any part of his body. This was just a crude application he had recently devised; with further understanding, its potential was limitless.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang shifted his focus from himself, looking up at his dharma form.</p><p>The Azure Bird Dharma Form!</p><p>The dharma form was still quite ethereal, but significantly more solid than before the breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang thoughtfully observed the Azure Bird Dharma Form.</p><p>If before, the dharma form was merely a shadow, now it was undergoing a transformation into reality.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't yet know what this change in his dharma form would bring, but he sensed another change it had triggered.</p><p>His phoenix wings!</p><p>Years ago, Qin Sang had absorbed the remnant soul of an Azure Bird from a stone tablet.  Because he wasn't a yokai, the Azure Bird's primordial lightning power had remained hidden within his wings.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense the immense power. The Azure Bird's primordial lightning power, in terms of rank, might not be inferior to the Southern Ming Li Fire or the Heavenly Phoenix True Fire.</p><p>But despite trying various methods, the Azure Bird's primordial lightning power felt like an insurmountable mountain.</p><p>He remembered Zhu Que's assessment: the Azure Bird's primordial lightning power had subtly merged with his energy, effectively becoming his power, but he hadn't yet found a way to control it.</p><p>With the transformation of his dharma form, he finally saw a way—controlling the Azure Bird's primordial lightning power would be through his Azure Bird Dharma Form!</p><p>He focused his mind on his phoenix wings, sensing the ferocious energy of the Azure Bird's primordial lightning power as always.  But now, he felt a connection, a closeness between himself and the power, achieved through the Azure Bird Dharma Form.</p><p>He surmised that as the Azure Bird Dharma Form solidified, he would eventually be able to control this power.</p><p>However…</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.  He wasn't an Azure Bird descendant, so he could only use the simplest, most direct method, which felt wasteful.</p><p>Or perhaps he could try to integrate it into his phoenix wings to further enhance his escape technique?</p><p>Qin Sang already knew the immense benefits of a top-tier escape technique.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang shook his head.  These were premature concerns; he should focus on refining his dharma form.</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he remembered the bone flute.</p><p>However, he didn't immediately take out the treasure to examine it.  The commotion caused by Bei Gong Nan Dou's talisman refinement was too great; this place wasn't suitable for a long stay.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up. Without any visible movement, a residual image remained where he stood, slowly dissipating.</p><p>Standing on the mountaintop, after dismantling the spirit array, Qin Sang looked around before heading to another cave dwelling, as per his original plan.</p><p>In a certain desolate mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the cave dwelling and eagerly took out the bone flute from his Qianjun ring.</p><p>After a brief sense, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly; the bone flute had indeed changed.</p><p>The "Heavenly Demon Transformation" only showed the first four layers; the subsequent cultivation techniques were obscured by mist.</p><p>It was the same now, but the bone flute transmitted a kind of guidance. Qin Sang summoned his Azure Bird Dharma form and, following the guidance, gently tossed the flute into the air.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The bone flute entered the Dharma form, suspending itself within, then suddenly emitted a brilliant light, illuminating the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang multitasked, observing the bone flute while sensing the Dharma form.</p><p>The Azure Bird Dharma form seemed unchanged, only a wisp of energy being absorbed by the bone flute.</p><p>The bone flute quickly dimmed, falling from above.</p><p>'Click!'</p><p>Qin Sang caught it, his mind probing again. He saw that the mist obscuring the cultivation techniques had been cleared from one layer, revealing the fifth layer of "Heavenly Demon Transformation"!</p><p>After a cursory glance at the cultivation technique, Qin Sang rejoiced.</p><p>Although the later techniques were still obscured by mist, this layer was enough to cultivate him to the equivalent of a peak Nascent Soul stage cultivator.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly realized something was amiss. He focused all his attention on the bone flute, carefully examining the technique.</p><p>Gradually, a strange expression flickered across Qin Sang's face.</p><p>The fifth layer of "Heavenly Demon Transformation," like the first four, was also divided into three levels: beginning, intermediate, and advanced, capable of further refining the bloodline and strengthening bloodline abilities.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang couldn't cultivate this part; he could only cultivate the body-tempering aspect.</p><p>However, at the fifth layer, "Heavenly Demon Transformation" gained another function: condensing the Dharma form!</p><p>And specifically, the Azure Bird Dharma form!</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood why he couldn't see the fifth layer before.</p><p>Only after his breakthrough, when the Azure Bird Dharma form transformed into a real entity, could the bone flute absorb energy from the Dharma form, determine the path he had taken, and thus create the corresponding cultivation technique.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang couldn't help but be startled. Could the bone flute change its cultivation techniques according to the bloodline of different cultivators?</p><p>There are countless demon races in the world, and the variety of bloodlines is innumerable. Could the bone flute contain them all?</p><p>What kind of treasure is this!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the bone flute in his hand. He had underestimated it; it wasn't just a simple container for recording cultivation techniques.</p><p>He examined it over and over for a long time, but couldn't discern anything more, so he put the bone flute away.</p><p>The cultivation technique was already imprinted in his mind.</p><p>After carefully studying it for a while and gaining some insight, Qin Sang began to attempt cultivation.</p><p>Clear starlight enveloped Qin Sang.</p><p>The obscure and dark stellar煞  and stellar energy invaded his body.</p><p>As his cultivation improved, the stellar energy attracted became denser, and the hidden dangers increased; but it made no difference to Qin Sang.</p><p>The stellar煞  couldn't penetrate his primordial spirit at all, firmly blocked by the Buddha light.</p><p>After ten months, Qin Sang awoke leisurely.</p><p>Thanks to the advantageous environment, even though the cultivation time wasn't long, his progress was remarkably good.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's expression didn't show much joy.</p><p>He focused his attention on the Azure Bird Dharma form and found that the condensation speed was very slow, with almost no change during this period.</p><p>It's conceivable that condensing the Dharma form would be a long process, so he shouldn't think about manipulating the Azure Bird's original thunder power for now.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected it was also related to his cultivation level.  Once he broke through to the mid or late stages of the fifth layer of "Heavenly Demon Transformation," the speed of Dharma form condensation should also increase.</p><p>Besides, condensing the Dharma form would bring other benefits to the cultivator, but most of them were related to bloodline abilities.  Since Qin Sang wasn't a descendant of the Azure Bird, he could only hope that the Azure Bird Dharma form would continue to bring about transformations to his thunder escape technique.</p><p>As for the Azure Bird Dharma form's own abilities, Qin Sang still needed to explore them slowly.</p><p>Familiarizing himself with the cultivation technique and consolidating his cultivation.</p><p>For the next six months, Qin Sang focused on these two things.</p><p>After half a year, Qin Sang stopped cultivating and decided to return to Crane鸣 Mountain.</p><p>Although this realm was suitable for physical cultivation, Qin Sang wouldn't be able to seek a new breakthrough in the short term.</p><p>Next, he should seriously consider the tribulation and the subsequent ascension.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the tribulation's aura again.  The feeling of dread had indeed lessened considerably.</p><p>He thought to himself,  the "Post Heaven Wooden Man Stele" and the "Seven Masters Buddha Seal" were both top-tier physical cultivation techniques. Relying on these two techniques, he should be able to survive this tribulation.</p><p>If he could refine a Royal Bell Talisman, success would be guaranteed.</p><p>Before that, Qin Sang had considered the Royal Bell Talisman as a lifeline if his breakthrough failed, to help him survive the tribulation.  He’d made some preparations, but it was difficult to focus on two things at once, and he hadn’t yet refined one.</p><p>The Royal Bell Talisman required special talisman paper and cinnabar, both precious treasures.  Furthermore, he wasn't an expert in talisman crafting, and didn't have the time to learn from scratch, so he needed to enlist a master talisman maker.</p><p>“For now, I should focus on these two divine abilities…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused. After his breakthrough, his perspective broadened.  Examining the two abilities again, as expected, he had new insights.  Many previously unclear points were now resolved. With some dedicated cultivation, he was sure to make significant progress.</p><p>“I’ll return to Crane Song Mountain to make arrangements. If I can refine the Royal Bell Talisman, that would be ideal; I’ll work on both tasks concurrently.”</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind and decided to return. But before that, he had one more thing to do.</p><p>Qin Sang first flew north, following the route he’d taken to the Gui Fang country, arriving near those demon kingdoms. He opened his spirit beast pouch and released the wolf demon.</p><p>“Although these demon kingdoms are vassals of Gui Fang, their rules aren't as strict, leaving many loopholes. With your abilities, it shouldn’t be difficult for you to rise in the demon kingdoms,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>The wolf demon prostrated itself. “Thank you for your compassion, Immortal. I’ll never forget your mercy.”</p><p>It hadn’t expected Qin Sang to actually let it go and had prepared to remain under his control.</p><p>“Immortal, what are your commands? I will do my utmost to complete them,” the wolf demon volunteered.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, “What good is your current strength to me? Wait until you regain your power in the demon kingdoms.”</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>The wolf demon performed a grand bow, summoned its demonic wind, and quickly disappeared from sight.</p><p>He wondered about the snake demon; what was its situation, had it infiltrated Gui Fang?</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t expected to gain anything significant from sending the two demons into the demon kingdoms. Their cultivation was too low to make a real difference to Gui Fang.  </p><p>It would be ideal to control a Demon Marquis.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the thought and returned to Crane Song Mountain.</p><p>Back in the city, Qin Sang summoned Shi Xuan and others, instructing them to gather information about the materials needed for the Royal Bell Talisman. Then he went alone to visit Master Gu Zhou in his courtyard.</p><p>Nearly twenty years had passed, but the courtyard hadn't changed. From the outside, it looked like a private residence, with no signboard.</p><p>Gu Zhou’s cultivation remained at the Nascent Soul mid-stage.</p><p>“I’ve come to ask you to reply to Daoist Zhi Jian. Unless something unforeseen happens, I’ll visit in four years.”</p><p>Qin Sang produced a handwritten letter.</p><p>Gu Zhou secretly assessed Qin Sang, understanding immediately. The closer to the Heavenly Tribulation, the stronger the aura it emanated, making it difficult to conceal. Judging by Qin Sang’s appearance, the tribulation was imminent. It was best not to travel, to avoid unforeseen circumstances during the tribulation.</p><p>“Rest assured, I will deliver the letter!” Gu Zhou solemnly replied.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, then stated his true purpose.  “I wish to refine a treasure, but I’m struggling to find the materials. Do you have any channels?”</p><p>His previous plan was to rely on Zhi Jian if he failed his breakthrough and couldn't refine the talisman. Now that he’d succeeded, the talisman wasn't urgent; he could gather the materials slowly.</p><p>Gu Zhou didn’t hesitate, inquired about the materials needed, and promised to help gather information.</p><p>After bidding farewell to Gu Zhou, Qin Sang left the courtyard, looking back with narrowed eyes. He hadn't intentionally investigated their background, but various clues indicated their patron was a powerful force.</p><p>Entangling with such a power, whether it was good or bad…</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly.</p><p>…</p><p>In the following time, Qin Sang remained in his cave, diligently cultivating the two divine abilities, making significant progress.  </p><p>It's worth mentioning that with the Seven Masters Buddha Seals, when studying the seventh seal, the Vajra Great Freedom Seal, Qin Sang found its profoundness exceeded expectations; each time he had new insights.</p><p>As for the Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele, Qin Sang only needed to cultivate systematically, patiently awaiting its completion.</p><p>During his seclusion, Shi Xuan and Gu Zhou successively sent back news and some spiritual items. However, a significant amount was still missing, most importantly the Kun Earth Blood Sand, for which they had no concrete leads.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang stopped worrying about it.</p><p>One day,</p><p>Qin Sang, without alerting anyone, left the city and arrived at his chosen tribulation site, looking up at the heavens.  The aura of the tribulation thunder was gathering in this world.</p><p>Qin Sang had gathered some information about tribulation experiences of cultivators in this world, and from the descriptions, they weren't significantly different from cultivators in the Storm World.</p><p>He wondered what kind of changes his arrival from another realm might trigger.</p><p></p>
