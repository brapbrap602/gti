<h1>Chapter 2153  Master</h1><p>Receiving no reply, Su Nu pushed open the door. The room was empty except for a wooden table holding two items.  She approached, discovering a white orb and a jade bottle.</p><p>With a touch of her spiritual sense, the orb suddenly dissolved.</p><p>Su Nu's eyes flickered. She stood still for a moment, then a thoughtful expression appeared on her face.  She turned to the jade bottle, seeing several crimson gold pills inside. Recognizing them as spirit pills that could rapidly increase cultivation, she was overjoyed.  Silently, she murmured, "Thank you, my lord, for the gift!"</p><p>Putting away the bottle, Su Nu searched carefully again, finding nothing else. She turned and left.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang and Yuan Miao had arrived at the location of the trading fair.</p><p>It was a long, narrow spirit island, with a long river running through it from end to end. The water flowed out from both sides, like a jade belt draped across the island, yet the river seemed inexhaustible, never drying up.</p><p>Elegant pavilions were built on both banks of the river.  Others had arrived before them, strolling along the riverside cobblestone paths.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was caught by a person. This individual was dressed in pristine white, their skin dazzlingly pale, with long white hair cascading down their back, their hair gently moving as they walked at a slow pace, exuding an ethereal and refined aura.</p><p>Three unusual spirit beasts followed behind them.</p><p>All three beasts had yellow fur, resembling foxes but larger, almost horse-sized, with two horns on their backs. They looked remarkably majestic and followed closely behind the person, their demeanor gentle.</p><p>"They're Cheng Huang beasts!"</p><p>Yuan Miao whispered, "That person is a master from the Bai Min nation."</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Bai Min nation, one of the Celestial Tribes, but didn't know the origin of the Cheng Huang beasts.</p><p>All three spirit beasts were in the Transformation Stage, equivalent to the Nascent Soul Stage of humans.  He wondered what was so special about them that warranted Yuan Miao's attention.</p><p>"Cheng Huang beasts have been renowned as auspicious beasts since ancient times," Yuan Miao explained. "Cultivators who can subdue one, live with it, and use its essence to harmonize and replenish their vital energy, can increase their lifespan. Of course, to gain more longevity, careful nurturing is needed.  Ancient legends speak of a lifespan increase of two thousand years, though that's likely an exaggeration.  However, it should still add several decades."</p><p>Qin Sang understood.  Longevity was meaningless to cultivators at the Void Refinement stage, but their descendants, those who hadn't reached that level, were still bound by lifespan. Subduing a Cheng Huang beast offered a chance to defy fate.</p><p>Spirit herbs that could increase lifespan were always highly sought after; naturally, Cheng Huang beasts were also incredibly valuable.</p><p>"Because of this trait, everyone covets Cheng Huang beasts, making them extremely rare in the world.  Legend has it that only the Bai Min nation in the entire East Sea still keeps a herd.  Cheng Huang beasts only serve one master in their lifetime, but the Bai Min nation possesses unique beast-taming techniques that allow a Cheng Huang beast to serve multiple masters, although the lifespan-extending effect is weakened.  For tribes and families, the value is even greater."</p><p>Yuan Miao's eyes shone with excitement; he had descendants.</p><p>Qin Sang was also deeply moved. He had many friends and descendants from the Storm World. Because of the thin spiritual energy and scarce resources in the lower realms, their cultivation had been delayed.  Even with the later acquisition of Azure Spirit Qi, which offered some compensation, they were still too far behind, having wasted too much of their lifespan. Most would likely be stuck at the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>This was a cruel reality.  In a few hundred or even a thousand years, they would either perish in a heavenly tribulation or die of old age.  Only a very small number would be able to break through to the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>The cultivator from the Bai Min nation entered a pavilion with the three Cheng Huang beasts.</p><p>Yuan Miao rejoiced, "That person is also here for the trading fair. Let's go!"</p><p>They reached the riverbank and headed towards that pavilion, when another person approached them.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>The person stopped, bowed to Qin Sang, "My name is Yu Chang'en. I apologize for the interruption, but may I ask for your honorable title, sir?"</p><p>"My surname is Qin. Are you also a human, Daoist Friend Yu?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, observing the man. He was dressed in brocade robes, with a jade belt around his waist, exuding an air of nobility.  He didn't look like a Void Refinement cultivator, but rather a wealthy man from the mortal world.</p><p>He guessed why the other man had stopped him. The trading fair had just begun, and people from other races were not common.</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Yu Chang'en was delighted. "I didn't expect to meet a fellow human so quickly.  Qin Daoist, are you also from Xunzhou?  I wonder in which immortal city is your Daoist temple located?"</p><p>In the past few days, Qin Sang had learned that there was contact between the various races and Xunzhou, one of the eight great celestial states.</p><p>Xunzhou is located in the northeast of Da Zhou, with the Mist Sea situated between two states and the Nüe River.</p><p>"I came to the Mist Sea from Kanzhou," Qin Sang said, "I've long heard that Xunzhou's landscape is unlike anywhere else.  A celestial city built in the sky, hidden amidst the wind and clouds, not fixed in one place, but moving with the wind. When the wind is strong, it travels tens of thousands of miles a day. Sadly, I've never had the time to visit."</p><p>Yu Chang'en laughed heartily, "It's just a land of raging winds. We've suffered enough from a wandering life. It can't compare to the beauty and abundance of Kanzhou.  Master Qin will surely be disappointed."</p><p>Meeting a fellow tribesman in a foreign land created an instant connection.  Yu Chang'en was also attending the trade fair, and they entered the pavilion together.</p><p>After a conversation, Qin Sang learned that Yu Chang'en came from the Yu family of Xunzhou. The Yu family are merchants in Xunzhou, and their purpose was to seek opportunities among the Yi people.</p><p>The Water and Sky clans of the Yi people, with the Water clan being closer to humans. Yu Chang'en had befriended a high-ranking member of the Water clan and was invited to the Yuanjiao Sea Market.</p><p>However, after careful investigation, Yu Chang'en discovered that the trade routes between Xunzhou and the Water clan were already monopolized by several powerful families in Xunzhou. The Yu family, not being among the strongest, found it difficult to carve out a share.</p><p>He came to the Sky clan's territory hoping for opportunities, hearing about a trade fair, and decided to join in. Unexpectedly, he met a fellow tribesman.</p><p>Learning Yu Chang'en's intentions, Qin Sang was struck by an idea.</p><p>Building a Daoist sect isn't a guarantee of lasting success. How to ensure its stable development and growing prosperity was a crucial question.</p><p>Storm Sea can currently accommodate Qingyang City. However, as the number of cultivators in Qingyang City increases and their cultivation improves, its expansion will inevitably lead to new challenges.</p><p>Recently, the Five Thunder Academy sent people to search Qingyang City, discovering some unique resources from the Storm World. Careful cultivation allows them to be traded with the Yi people for needed cultivation resources, but this only offers temporary relief.</p><p>Qingyang City is still too small. It cannot conquer the outside world or absorb other forces to expand.  A different approach is necessary.</p><p>Qin Sang's first thought was trade. Their advantage is being a rare human force recognized by the Sky clan, backed by the Siyou and Zhuyan clans.  He also hoped to establish connections with the Jihong and Jiaojiao clans.</p><p>Preparing for the journey to the sacred land put these plans on hold.</p><p>Currently, Qingyang City's strength makes expansion difficult.  A high-ranking figure is needed to navigate the complexities. Qin Sang lacks the time, and Su Nu is in seclusion and unable to handle this task.</p><p>Once the situation stabilizes, it will be easier. Daily affairs can be handled by junior members, with a Nascent Soul cultivator to address occasional problems.  Qin Sang can borrow personnel from Silu.</p><p>Learning Yu Chang'en's intentions, Qin Sang saw an opportunity.  He could leverage the Yu family to establish a framework for Qingyang City's trade, then contact old friends in Kanzhou to smoothly establish the business.</p><p>If Qingyang City could monopolize trade between the Yi people and the two states of Da Zhou, there would be no need to worry about cultivation resources.  Perhaps, it could even support him, the lord of Qingyang City, in the future.</p><p>However, achieving this goal requires more than Qingyang City alone.  Others surely have the same idea and are already secretly working towards it.  For little Qingyang City to grow and seize this opportunity, open and hidden conflicts are inevitable. It's best to bring Zhuyan, Siyou, and Jiaojiao into the fold.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang pondered the details at the trade fair, appearing somewhat listless.</p><p>However, when a cultivator from Baimin Kingdom sold a Cheng Huang beast, Qin Sang purchased it at a high price.</p><p>As the sun set, the trade fair ended. Qin Sang invited Yu Chang'en to visit, and he readily accepted.</p><p>Back at the cave abode, Qin Sang entrusted the Cheng Huang beast to Li Yufu, instructing him and Yu Nu to prepare for cooperation with the Yu family.</p><p>…</p><p>Days turned into nights.</p><p>More cultivators arrived at the Yuanjiao Sea Market, and the treasure tree was laden with ripe fruits, a vibrant red sight.</p><p>Qin Sang seized this opportunity, frequenting various trade fairs to acquire desirable spiritual items. He witnessed many unique treasures of the Yi people, broadening his horizons.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang and Yu Chang'en interacted frequently, deepening their understanding of each other.</p><p>Yu Chang'en was surprised to learn that Qin Sang's Daoist sect was established in the Mist Sea, further increasing his enthusiasm.</p><p>Qin Sang also learned about Yu Chang'en's character and the Yu family's strength. He is a flexible and far-sighted person.  In their conversations, the Yu family expressed their willingness to contribute manpower and resources, with Qingyang City maintaining the leading role.</p><p>As with all good things, this alliance wouldn't be settled quickly. Even with mutual intentions, they needed to gather personnel, discuss details, and weigh the pros and cons.</p><p>Li Yu Fu and Yu Nu tentatively selected some people to form a chamber of commerce, including Master Mu from Liu Zhou Hall and others. They would begin preparations immediately upon their return.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yu Chang En set a time for Yu Chang En to lead skilled members of the Yu family to visit Qing Yang Zhi. If Qin Sang wasn't back from the Sacred Land by then, Su Nu would act in his stead.</p><p>One day,</p><p>Qin Sang and Yu Chang En had a pleasant conversation.  Just after seeing Yu Chang En off, he encountered Su Nu returning.</p><p>"Have you been having some trouble lately?" Qin Sang stopped Su Nu, asking in a low voice.</p><p>Su Nu was startled, managing a weak smile. "I couldn't hide it from Brother Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. Su Nu had been disappearing for long periods, and her expression had been off.  Even though he’d been focused on the trade fair and Yu Chang En, he'd sensed something was amiss.</p><p>"If it concerns your own secrets, I won't pry. If you've offended someone, even if we're no match for them, we can ask the Yuan Xiang Clan Chief to mediate," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Since their reunion over two hundred years ago, Su Nu had always helped him wholeheartedly whenever he needed assistance, even at the cost of her own cultivation.  Without Su Nu, Qing Yang Zhi wouldn't have been built so quickly and smoothly.</p><p>If Su Nu was in trouble, he certainly had to return the favor.</p><p>"Thank you for your concern, Brother Qin."</p><p>Su Nu sighed lightly. "It's a private matter, so I didn't want to bother you. Please forgive me."</p><p>After hesitating, Su Nu softly said, "I've discovered traces left by my master."</p><p>"Your master? In Yuan Qiao Hai Shi?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>He remembered Su Nu mentioning that her master had guided her for a time before leaving, vanishing without a trace. Su Nu said her master was a human cultivator, but that wasn't necessarily true.  If her master intentionally concealed their identity, Su Nu wouldn't be able to see through it.</p><p>"I only found faint traces. I don't know if they were left recently or in the past.  I've been searching, but haven't found more clues. And…"</p><p>A look of confusion flashed in Su Nu's eyes. "The trace… it points beyond Yuan Qiao Hai Shi, to the deeper parts of the Nie River!"</p><p>…</p><p>That night,</p><p>The moon hung high, its light like water.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu quietly left Yuan Qiao Hai Shi.  Flying above the clouds, they immediately felt the chaotic power permeating the void.</p><p>The sea below churned with terrifying black waves, Yuan Qiao Hai Shi appearing as the only sanctuary in an apocalyptic scene.</p><p>The foul air had receded somewhat.  They could see a black curtain on the horizon. They slowly flew towards it.  Upon reaching the foul air, they felt a power akin to heavenly wrath, a black tide.  Both looked grave at the horrifying sight.</p><p>"The depths of the Nie River are unknown. We shouldn't go in person," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Su Nu nodded in agreement.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, flashing down to the sea's surface. He condensed a piece of profound ice with his true essence, letting it rise and fall with the waves.</p><p>They landed on the ice. Qin Sang manifested his Dharma body, while Su Nu took out a palm-sized stone carving.  Its material was unknown, gray-white in color, with a dull expression.</p><p>Su Nu infused it with true essence. The carving's expression immediately became lively.  She then lightly touched the carving's forehead with her index finger, a point of black light appearing.  Within the light was a complex rune, faintly carrying Su Nu's spiritual essence, which entered the carving.</p><p>The carving rapidly grew, transforming into a stone gargoyle warrior, standing beside Qin Sang's Dharma body as they charged into the foul air.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Passing through the black curtain, Qin Sang felt the earth shatter and the heavens collapse, far more chaotic than what he had witnessed at the river's edge.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma body paused slightly, gazing into the distance.  He didn’t see the arrangement of small thousand worlds from before.  He turned to the stone gargoyle warrior, seeing its aura subdued as it used a secret technique to sense direction.</p><p>After a moment, the stone gargoyle pointed to the right front, emitting a voice identical to Su Nu's: "There!"</p><p>Wherever they passed, the sky and earth changed color, accompanied by wind and thunder, causing even greater chaos.</p><p>Su Nu would occasionally stop to re-sense and change direction. The further they went, the more strange and terrifying the Nie River became.</p>
