<h1>Chapter 2041: Emptying a Sect</h1><p>Qin Sang appeared outside the formation, gazing at the newcomer. He saw a Daoist with frosted hair and beard, yet a vigorous spirit. The Daoist wore cloud boots, and rainbow light accompanied his every step, a truly wondrous sight.</p><p>Judging by his aura, he was undoubtedly a cultivator at the mid-stage Soul Formation realm.</p><p>Combined with the direction from which he came, Qin Sang's thoughts turned and he immediately knew who it was. He slightly cupped his hands, "Greetings, Palace Master Yan."</p><p>Qin Sang secretly maintained his vigilance.</p><p>This person must be the enigmatic Grand Palace Master of the Liyu Palace. The world only knew him as Palace Master Yan, unaware of his true name.</p><p>Because it was only a phantom avatar, it was impossible to accurately judge his true strength. However, the rumors shouldn't be too exaggerated.  Still, since he wasn't at the late-stage Soul Formation realm, Qin Sang wouldn't be overly apprehensive.</p><p>Palace Master Yan only dispatched an avatar here to stop the fight, seemingly with the intention of mediating. However, it was also hard to say if it wasn't a delaying tactic. This person had always been reclusive. Only the previous generation head of the Xin family had interacted with him a few times. Xin Sheng and the others didn't know his temperament.</p><p>"Greetings, Fellow Daoist Qin."</p><p>Palace Master Yan performed a Daoist salute, his expression amiable. He glanced at the sword formation beneath Qin Sang, but didn't ask him to release Palace Master Ling. Instead, he asked, "Fellow Daoist Qin, you must not be from Qiong Lake, otherwise with your divine abilities, you would have already shaken the four corners of the world.  May I ask, where is your Immortal Abode?"</p><p>Listening to his tone, Qin Sang realized that Palace Master Yan seemed to want to turn hostility into friendship.  It was likely the fight wouldn't happen.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't say whether he was happy or not. He took out a token and tossed it towards Palace Master Yan.</p><p>Palace Master Yan recognized the origin of the token. His expression immediately turned solemn, and he saluted again, "So it's Elder Qin of the Five Elements Alliance! My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>"Palace Master Yan, you are too kind!"</p><p>Qin Sang returned the salute, thinking to himself that the reputation of the Five Elements Alliance was indeed useful, its fame spreading beyond the Eight Great Celestial Provinces.</p><p>Palace Master Yan returned the token to Qin Sang and smiled, "Elder Qi of your esteemed Alliance has presided over the Wu Yu Mountain branch for thousands of years. I, Yan, was fortunate enough to have Elder Qi refine a spirit treasure for me. Two thousand years ago, when the Heaven Shocking Bandits invaded Qiong Lake, it was thanks to Elder Qi and the full support of your esteemed Alliance that we were able to repel that group of parasitic cultivators.  It's a pity that I, Yan, have been focused on cultivation and haven't visited Elder Qi for hundreds of years."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He had only studied the situation near Qiong Lake and didn't know where Wu Yu Mountain was or what faction the Heaven Shocking Bandits belonged to, let alone events from two thousand years ago.</p><p>It seemed the Heaven Shocking Bandits were a group of parasitic cultivators who lived by plunder.</p><p>Cultivators in the vast world couldn't achieve enlightenment just by painstakingly cultivating in their caves. Cultivation also required precious materials and external medicines.</p><p>Some relied on their sect's supply, some were gentlemen who loved wealth but obtained it through righteous means, while others completely degenerated into bandits, gathering together in hordes, coming and going like the wind, committing all manner of evil deeds like locusts swarming through.</p><p>The vast world was boundless, making them difficult to catch.</p><p>This highlighted the advantages of the Eight Great Celestial Provinces. Although the Great Zhou was only the nominal overlord, the Great Zhou Celestial Laws were deeply ingrained, having some effect, making the parasitic cultivators apprehensive and preventing them from being too reckless.</p><p>"It's a pity that I, Qin, have only recently joined the Five Elements Alliance and haven't been to Wu Yu Mountain yet, so I haven't had the chance to meet Elder Qi," Qin Sang said honestly.</p><p>"It's alright. If Elder Qin has free time recently, we can go visit together," Palace Master Yan smiled.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back at Bi Shui Village, shaking his head, "I'm afraid there won't be an opportunity! I, Qin, have other important matters and must quickly return to my sect. I can't stay in Qiong Lake for too long."</p><p>Palace Master Yan let out a surprised sound, "Elder Qin doesn't intend to establish a Daoist field here? Could it be that the scenery of Qiong Lake doesn't appeal to Elder Qin's discerning eye?"</p><p>Just now, Palace Master Ling had been clamoring to kill him, yet Palace Master Yan seemed to want to keep him here. Qin Sang didn't know if he was sincere or not and replied, "Qiong Lake is vast like the sea and rich in resources, but I, Qin, am merely a guest. My sect is my Daoist field. For us cultivators, traversing millions of miles is as easy as a stroll, but it is extremely difficult for disciples to relocate.  They shouldn't be moved lightly."</p><p>Hearing these words, Palace Master Yan was certain that Qin Sang was most likely sincere.  As a Palace Master himself, he understood the responsibilities of such a position.</p><p>Since that was the case, Liyu Palace could tolerate this, and today's grievances could be resolved.</p><p>"I wonder how Elder Qin plans to deal with Bi Shui Village?"</p><p>"In my opinion, Cultivator Zhong Liang has managed such a vast enterprise, abandoning it would be a pity.  If there are fellow Daoists willing to take over Bi Shui Village, I, Qin, would be happy to see it happen."</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, his voice carrying no disguise.</p><p>Due to his fight with Palace Master Ling, the attention of the surrounding forces in Qiong Lake had been drawn, focusing on his conversation with Palace Master Yan.</p><p>These words were also meant for them to hear. Qin Sang had already decided to sell Bi Shui Village. The question was to whom and how to sell it to get a good price.</p><p>Bi Shui Village wasn't just Cultivator Zhong Liang's cave abode.  It possessed the foundation of a sect. The surrounding forces in Qiong Lake would certainly be interested, but they would first have to observe Liyu Palace's attitude. Since Liyu Palace failed to subdue Qin Sang, the next step would be to see who offered the highest price.</p><p>Just then, within the sword formation, the black circle gradually shrank, the clouds and mist dispersed, and Ling Du stepped out.</p><p>He sensed the Grand Palace Master's arrival and abandoned the idea of a breakthrough during the fight. His realm remained at the early-stage Soul Formation, and he had also put away that supreme treasure. He stood with his hands behind his back, gazing at the sky, seemingly surrendering.</p><p>Qin Sang formed a sword seal. Immediately, a streak of sword light disappeared into his sleeve. The starlight instantly dissipated, revealing Ling Du's figure.</p><p>"My apologies! Palace Master Ling's divine abilities are profound.  I, Qin, didn't dare to hold back. I hope Palace Master Ling won't take offense."</p><p>Ling Du said coldly, "I was simply less skilled. There's nothing more to say! We'll fight again another day!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that this person was quite forthright. "If there's a chance, I, Qin, will certainly accept the challenge."</p><p>Ling Du didn't say anything more. He performed a salute to Palace Master Yan, and his Dharma Body instantly returned to his true body, transforming into a rainbow and escaping towards his sect.</p><p>Palace Master Yan watched this scene with a smile, finally turning his gaze towards Bi Shui Village, "Is that Fellow Daoist also an Elder of your esteemed Alliance?"</p><p>After Palace Master Yan appeared, Su Nu also released her aura in Bi Shui Village, remotely offering support.</p><p>"No, she is my friend.  She came here at my invitation," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Palace Master Yan nodded, "The two of you have only recently taken Bi Shui Village. You must have many things to arrange. Three days from now, I, Yan, will send an envoy from my sect to pay a visit."</p><p>"Our humble abode will be honored by your presence. We will certainly prepare a grand welcome."</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands and watched as Palace Master Yan's figure vanished.</p><p>After Palace Master Yan left, the divine senses focused on this area didn't disperse.  They each declared their identities and greeted Qin Sang from afar, but didn't discuss any serious matters.</p><p>Next, each party would send envoys to discuss the matter of Bi Shui Village.</p><p>With the storm subsided, Qin Sang transformed into sword light and flew above Bi Shui Village. Su Nu immediately ordered the opening of the mountain gates and personally came out to greet him, smiling brightly, "Congratulations, Brother Qin, on your resounding victory."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, "This wasn't a fight to the death, and Palace Master Yan wasn't willing to intervene personally.  Otherwise, the outcome is uncertain."</p><p>As he spoke, he entered Bi Shui Village. He made a few inquiries and saw that Su Nu's considerations were very thorough, having arranged all matters properly in such a short time. He couldn't help but think to himself that she was truly a capable assistant.</p><p>They had completely taken control of Bi Shui Village. What followed would be a feast of division.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Bi Shui Village disciples to be handed over to Xin Sheng. Then, he and Su Nu went to the sect's treasury.</p><p>Cultivation techniques, secret arts, myriad precious materials, spiritual pills, and miraculous medicines…</p><p>The most valuable items had been carried by Cultivator Zhong Liang and were destroyed in the tomb.  These treasures weren't as useful to Qin Sang and Su Nu, but they were precious resources for developing a sect. Qin Sang wanted to transform the Storm Realm into his own Daoist field, and these were indispensable.</p><p>All the treasured possessions of the sect that could be taken away were taken.  Fortunately, Qin Sang had obtained a cave realm. Moving the treasury wouldn't take up much space, and he was even more thorough than parasitic cultivators in his plunder.</p><p>Even the immature spiritual herbs in the medicine fields were transplanted into the small cave realm. If the Bi Shui Village's protective formation hadn't been rooted in the earth veins and immovable, he would have even wanted to move the entire formation.</p><p>In the future, the new owner of Bi Shui Village would surely wonder what to do when faced with the empty sect.</p><p>Of course, the things he could take away were only a part of the sect's foundation.  The mountain gates, spiritual veins, spiritual mines, formations, medicine fields, human resources, and so on could still be sold for a good price.</p><p>Qin Sang did the same with Attendant Pei's cave abode, and then quietly waited for buyers to come.</p><p>Three days after the Qiong Lake battle, envoys from Liyu Palace arrived. Soon after, envoys from other forces also arrived one after another, all receiving warm hospitality.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu had already drafted a list, categorizing the items for sale, while the items he sought were mostly spiritual materials used for constructing the Thunder Altar.</p><p>Two Soul Formation Daoist fields, with protective formations meticulously arranged by Soul Formation cultivators, were worth a considerable amount just by themselves.</p><p>Except for the most crucial items, the negotiations were handled by Su Nu and Xin Sheng. Qin Sang spent most of his time in secluded cultivation within Cultivator Zhong Liang's cave abode.</p><p>From the fight with Palace Master Ling, Qin Sang had gained immense benefits, deepening his understanding of the Four Symbols Sword Formation and the Array Stacking Technique.</p><p>Sword light illuminated the cave abode and then dimmed again.</p><p>Qin Sang manifested the Four Symbols Sword Formation, his mind communicating with the Vermilion Bird. His divine sense swept across the western and southern star regions, finally landing on the cave abode.  There, what was once only a chaotic nebula now had a few flickering stars.</p><p>This was a good sign. Once Qin Sang perfected the Array Stacking Technique, he would attempt to create the other two sword formations.</p><p>Of course, the most important thing was still his cultivation.  Qin Sang contemplated the sword formation for a while and then entered meditative cultivation, stabilizing his foundation.</p><p>Day and night alternated.</p><p>The restrictions outside the cave abode were suddenly triggered.</p><p>Qin Sang roused himself leisurely, introspecting on his own body.  The effects of this cultivation session were remarkable, significantly stabilizing his foundation.</p><p>Sensing his own cultivation level, Qin Sang estimated that after fully absorbing the gains from the Praising Curse, he could faintly touch upon the bottleneck of the mid-stage Soul Formation realm!</p><p>The Earth Slaughter Sword represented the future. For now, the gains Qin Sang obtained in the tomb were an immediate boost.</p><p>Thinking of Xin Sheng's contributions, Qin Sang didn't intend to keep everything for himself this time. He would share a portion of the profits with the Xin family.</p><p>Outside were Su Nu, Xin Sheng, and others. Granted entry into the cave abode, Su Nu handed a mustard seed bag to Qin Sang, clapped her hands, and said with a relaxed expression, "Fortunately, I've completed the task. Everything outside has been settled!"</p><p>"Thank you for your hard work!"</p><p>Qin Sang rose, gazing at the mountains and rivers outside, "We should also leave.  Liyu Palace should be coming to take over."</p><p>He looked at Xin Sheng and said, "This matter has been resolved smoothly. The Xin family's situation should be much better than expected.  In a few days, Fellow Daoist Su Nu and I will visit the two Palace Masters.  We will also ask Liyu Palace to look after you. Do you still want to move to Dui Province?"</p><p>The Xin family had clearly discussed this matter beforehand. Xin Sheng replied, "Even a cunning rabbit has three burrows. We plan to select a group of promising clansmen and send them away secretly. In case of unforeseen circumstances, we can preserve a branch of our lineage.  We'll trouble Elder Qin to settle them in Dui Province!"</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "You might as well go to Dui Province too. I'll ask the Five Elements Alliance to arrange a safe cave abode for you. After you break through to Soul Formation, you can return to Qiong Zhe Mountain and revive the Xin family."</p><p>It was evident that Xin Sheng had benefited greatly from the Praising Curse, being only a step away from Soul Formation.  The possibility of him breaking through wasn't small.</p><p>However, there was no certainty in realm breakthroughs. It still depended on Xin Sheng's fate.  During the crucial moment of breakthrough, he would need to enter secluded cultivation, focusing entirely on his practice, without any outside disturbances.</p><p>Hearing this, Steward Luo and the Xin family's Grand Elder strongly agreed, urging Xin Sheng to heed Qin Sang's advice. Xin Sheng was the Xin family's hope. As long as the Xin family produced a Soul Formation cultivator, they wouldn't have to rely on others anymore.</p><p>"Rest assured, Young Master. We will definitely look after Qiong Zhe Mountain. Elder Qin's prestige still lingers.  As long as Liyu Palace doesn't take the lead in targeting the Xin family, we will have at least a hundred years of peace."</p><p>After some consideration, Xin Sheng agreed.</p><p>The next day, people from Liyu Palace arrived, and Qin Sang's group withdrew from Bi Shui Village. The Xin family began their preparations in full swing.</p><p>On the appointed day, Qin Sang and Su Nu traveled together to Liyu Palace. Palace Master Yan and Palace Master Ling personally welcomed them.</p><p>Although Ling Du wasn't exactly welcoming, he didn't speak harshly either.</p><p>The banquet concluded, and both hosts and guests were pleased.</p><p>Returning from Liyu Palace, Qin Sang gathered the members of the Hengsha Society and, as agreed, refined treasures for each of them. After finishing this, Qin Sang and Su Nu secretly left Qiong Zhe Mountain, taking Xin Sheng and a dozen members of the Xin family with them.</p><p>They didn't return to Jade Gate Pass but instead headed towards Dui Province, arriving at an immortal city on the border of Dui Province.</p><p>Qin Sang contacted the Five Elements Alliance, stating his name and rank.  The Five Elements Alliance quickly arranged a cave abode according to his requirements.</p><p>One evening, Qin Sang and his group flew over mountains and arrived at a place shrouded in immortal clouds, a land of exquisite beauty.</p><p>This place was called Nanpu Stream. There used to be a sect here, but it later declined, though the mountain formation remained. Qin Sang rented it for a hundred years as a temporary residence for the Xin family.</p><p>As a Daoist field, Nanpu Stream was far inferior to Qiong Zhe Mountain.  The Xin family couldn't prosper here, but there was a superior cave abode in the mountains, sufficient to support Xin Sheng's breakthrough to the Soul Formation realm.</p><p>Xin Sheng easily took control of the mountain gate formation.  Knowing that Qin Sang was about to leave, even with a thousand reluctances, he couldn't express them. Suppressing his surging emotions, he asked, "How can we contact Elder Qin in the future?"</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade pendant and said, "I will be going to Kan Province. Communication will be inconvenient, so I can only ask the Five Elements Alliance to relay messages.  I will find a way to stay in contact with the Five Elements Alliance in Kan Province.  You can attach this token to your message."</p><p>Xin Sheng agreed and solemnly received the jade pendant.</p><p>"Until we meet again!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate any longer. He slightly cupped his hands and, together with Su Nu, transformed into light and departed.</p><p>Xin Sheng tightly grasped the jade pendant, standing on the mountain peak, watching the two until their light disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>…</p><p>Bidding farewell to Xin Sheng, Qin Sang, Su Nu, and Gu Ya traveled through several locations, making no stops along the way, and returned to Lian City.</p><p>The great chaos at Feng Ju Jade Gate hadn't completely subsided.  Jade Gate Pass had become a deserted city, yet Lian City remained as peaceful and prosperous as ever, seemingly unaffected.</p><p>After entering Lian City, Qin Sang sent Su Nu and Gu Ya away and quickly went to their previously agreed upon location. Seeing Jian Nu safe and sound, waiting for him there, he hurriedly asked, "Have you heard any news of Senior Tian Yue?"</p>
