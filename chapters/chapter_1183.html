<h1>Chapter 1175: Flame Fusion Pill</h1><p>Soon, it was time to part ways.</p><p>The White Crane and the Snake King's trusted aide returned to the Thousand Bamboo Sea to deliver the good news to the Willow Demon and the White Cat.</p><p>Qin Sang had initially intended for the Fat Chicken to return as well.</p><p>However, the Fat Chicken stubbornly insisted on staying by Qin Sang's side, even if it meant entering the Primordial Unity Ring. It vowed not to be as reckless as its brother and promised to follow Qin Sang's every command.</p><p>Qin Sang, realizing the need for a capable assistant, decided to let the Fat Chicken stay, as it was more perceptive than the White Crane.</p><p>With the Fat Chicken in tow, Qin Sang turned his attention to the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang and the Snake King had returned to the Ten Thousand Demons City to obtain a decree from the Feather Demon King.</p><p>"Until we meet again!" Qin Sang clasped his fists and strode away.</p><p>As Qin Sang disappeared into the distance, the smile on the Snake King's face gradually faded. He ordered his subordinates, "Hurry back and prepare for Yue'er's departure. We must not lose face."</p><p>"Yes!" The subordinates obeyed and left, leaving only the two demon kings behind.</p><p>"Father-in-law, is it really necessary to be so courteous to that brat and even send Yue'er to him? That crane seems more like a rogue than anything else. Aren't you worried about ruining Yue'er's future?"</p><p>The Puppeteer Demon King still harbored resentment towards Qin Sang and was reluctant to agree.</p><p>"In my presence, would he dare to act like a rogue? I don't believe I can't control him."</p><p>The Snake King snorted, "Haven't you seen how Yue'er is? Her heart is already flying towards him. How can we stop her? Even if he's fickle, it doesn't matter. Don't you have a favorite concubine yourself? Do you think I don't know? If Yue'er gets angry and disposes of the unfaithful, I can cover for her. She can always come back later. Consider it a trial for her."</p><p>The Puppeteer Demon King, feeling awkward, quickly changed the subject, "I have failed your expectations, father-in-law, by not forcing him to hand over the spirit insect. What are your plans now?"</p><p>The Snake King pondered for a moment.</p><p>"Your Mystic Poison Domain, son-in-law, is more than just about poison. It excels in illusions and restrictions. Even I would find it difficult to break free in a short time.</p><p>"Yet, he was completely unaffected, always accurately finding your true form and clearly seeing through your attacks.</p><p>"During the spirit insect's tribulation, you vaguely saw the shadow of a butterfly.</p><p>"Earlier, the divine light he used to break your Serpent Emperor Shadow Technique also originated from the wings of a spirit butterfly.</p><p>"Although its appearance differs slightly from the records, the spirit butterfly's wings bear the distinctive pair of eyes. We were right before—that fourth-stage spirit insect is most likely the rare Heavenly Eye Butterfly!"</p><p>The Puppeteer Demon King frowned and pressed, "Have you decided to invite him to the Sin Abyss? Why didn't you just tell him directly earlier?"</p><p>"It is said that even at the third stage, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's Heavenly Eye ability is formidable, easily spotting weaknesses in restrictions. A fourth-stage Heavenly Eye Butterfly is even more extraordinary. Your Serpent Emperor Shadow Technique was exposed with just a slight flaw, causing you to suffer a backlash. This proves that the Moonlight Demon King is undoubtedly the best choice for breaking ancient restrictions, especially in such a place where speed is crucial. Moreover, his escape techniques and strength are extraordinary. Even I wouldn't be confident of defeating him today. Inviting him to infiltrate the Sin Abyss, even if our tracks are exposed, we won't be burdened. However..."</p><p>The Snake King hesitated, feeling somewhat troubled, "This man treats the Heavenly Eye Butterfly as his life. Borrowing it is out of the question. But with one more person sharing the spoils, the treasures won't be enough. We need to discuss this with Fellow Daoist Lu and the others first."</p><p>Hearing the Snake King's high praise for Qin Sang, the Puppeteer Demon King was deeply dissatisfied.</p><p>"If I had been more prepared, I wouldn't have suffered a backlash. If you hadn't stopped me, father-in-law, the fight could have continued!"</p><p>The Snake King advised, "It's ultimately something useless to you. Don't let it become a grudge and breed prejudice. When he agreed to your duel, I had a premonition. Since he also had to guard against me, he must have had sufficient confidence. What he showed was definitely not his full strength. Not to mention, the complete Ten Directions Yama Banners consist of ten flags. The Ghost Yin Daoist was a genius. If he hadn't focused all his energy on refining treasures, neglecting his cultivation, his achievements wouldn't have been inferior to the Nether Demon. The Moonlight Demon King chose to duel outside the Ten Thousand Demons City, also intending to establish his authority. He probably won't remain as low-key as Old Bamboo. The most terrifying thing is,</p><p>he has just reached the Transformation stage. His future potential is limitless. Forming a good relationship won't be wrong. Let's wait and see."</p><p>The Puppeteer Demon King's expression shifted uncertainly, but he finally sighed and nodded.</p><p>The two demon kings gradually walked away.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang was flying towards the Beast Taming Sect, reflecting on the recent battle.</p><p>Thanks to his numerous divine abilities and treasures, he had been completely at ease during his fight with the Puppeteer Demon King. If not for the restricted battlefield, victory would have been even easier.</p><p>He still had the Twelve Demon Banner Formation and the Thunder Control Technique up his sleeve.</p><p>Additionally, the Ebony Sword was refining the Soul Nurturing Wood. It wouldn't be long before Qin Sang possessed a top-grade life-bound spirit sword.</p><p>By then, the Seven Souls Killing Formation would be even more powerful, and the Blood Filth Divine Light would remain a deadly weapon.</p><p>Calculating all this, Qin Sang realized his strength was truly formidable.</p><p>When the opportunity arose, he would definitely give Dongyang Bo a surprise he would never forget!</p><p>A slight smile curled on Qin Sang's lips as he summoned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>She had been the greatest contributor to the recent duel.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Divine Light had achieved its first victory.</p><p>Qin Sang was gradually figuring out some patterns. The effectiveness of the Heavenly Eye Divine Light in breaking techniques depended on the opponent's cultivation level, the type of technique or divine ability, the speed of its execution, and its power.</p><p>It wasn't effective in all situations, but it was undoubtedly a powerful tool in combat.</p><p>"Later, I'll visit the Beast Taming Sect and look through their archives. Perhaps I can find some spirit herbs you like..."</p><p>Feeling the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's playful and proud demeanor, Qin Sang smiled and gently stroked her.</p><p>Flying over the mountains, Qin Sang arrived at the Immortal-Demon City.</p><p>The Beast Taming Sect's mountain gate was just outside the city.</p><p>Qin Sang went straight to their doorstep.</p><p>He had always worn a mask during his travels, and the demon kings attributed it to his eccentricity, so no one questioned it.</p><p>Although the Snake Granny had seen his face, she would never have guessed that this demon king was the same disciple from Shaohua Mountain who had obtained the Snow Spirit Lotus and the Iris Flower.</p><p>The Beast Taming Sect had already received news and sent someone to greet him at the mountain gate.</p><p>Upon inquiry, Qin Sang learned that the Snake Granny was not at the sect, but the vice-sect leader could make decisions.</p><p>With the Feather King's decree, as long as Qin Sang promised not to disclose what he saw today to anyone, he was granted access to the treasure vault to peruse texts related to insect taming.</p><p>Without much effort, Qin Sang found what he was looking for.</p><p>The Beast Taming Sect's collection was indeed vast.</p><p>There were bamboo scrolls, jade slips, scripture tubes, and even stone books.</p><p>Most were fragments, and many were extremely obscure.</p><p>There were even ancient texts about blood-feeding spirit insects, which would later feed back cultivation to the master, but only fragments remained.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't miss a single one, reading slowly and spending an entire day in the treasure vault, pondering and comprehending these insect taming techniques, comparing them with what he had learned from the Witch Clan. His gains were substantial.</p><p>To his disappointment, he found no ancient texts related to the fourth-stage Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>However, Qin Sang unexpectedly discovered a jade slip detailing a pill that might be effective for the Fire Jade Centipede—the Flame Fusion Pill.</p><p>The ingredients for the Flame Fusion Pill were not particularly rare and could still be found in the present world, making them relatively easy to gather.</p><p>******</p>
