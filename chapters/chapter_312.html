Chapter 305 A Changed World

The Man-Headed Serpent knew the power of the talisman treasure. It was incredibly cunning and, with its superior speed, refused to engage Qin Sang in close combat.  Although the talisman treasure was potent, it was difficult to find another opportunity to inflict serious damage like before.

Qin Sang dared not recall the talisman treasure. If he revealed a weakness, the consequences would be dire. Because of this, he could only persevere, his spiritual power nearing depletion, without achieving much.

Fortunately, his goal wasn't to injure the Man-Headed Serpent, but to buy time for Yun Youzi.
He absolutely couldn't let their efforts go to waste.

Qin Sang swallowed a spiritual pill. Though his stomach cramped in pain, he relentlessly drew upon his Qi Sea, gathering every last sliver of spiritual power to drive the Ebony Sword.

Finally, Yun Youzi was ready with the Flawless Pearl.
"Go!"

With Yun Youzi's soft shout, the Flawless Pearl spun rapidly, its light vibrating intensely. It transformed into a long spear and shot out!

The spear of light was dazzling.

Sensing the danger, the Man-Headed Serpent shrieked loudly. It abruptly abandoned its attack and turned to flee.

Its speed was extraordinary, like a thin black thread, as it flew towards its nest. But the spear was faster, like a shooting star chasing the moon. In the blink of an eye, it caught up to the Man-Headed Serpent.

*Bang!*

The spear of light pierced through the Man-Headed Serpent.

A shrill scream echoed.

Blood splattered across the sky.

However, a late-stage Nascent Soul demon was not easy to kill.

At the last moment, thick black Qi surged from the Man-Headed Serpent's wings. Its form twisted bizarrely, and it managed to break free from the Flawless Pearl's lock, avoiding a fatal blow.

The Man-Headed Serpent survived, but it was severely injured.

After its scream, its arrogance vanished completely. It dragged its wounded body and fled into the restrictive barrier.

Just then, a thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He urgently called out to Yun Youzi, "Senior! Save him!"

Yun Youzi immediately grasped Qin Sang's intention. Gathering the remaining spiritual power of the Flawless Pearl, he guided it with his arm. The Flawless Pearl paused slightly, the spearhead shifting direction, aiming towards the red mist.

The person they wanted to save was certainly not Ge Yuan.
However, Shangguan Lifeng could be saved!
Luo Xingnan was still alive, and this man harbored treacherous intentions.

Yun Youzi had exhausted himself activating the Flawless Pearl, losing his combat strength. The Jade Ruyi talisman treasure was nearly shattered, leaving only Qin Sang and the Scholar in White on their side.

This meant that even if they escaped the Man-Headed Serpent and the Hooked Serpents, they were still not safe.

The enemy of their enemy was their friend.
Luo Xingnan had used them as bait; they would save his victims!

The Hooked Serpent King, witnessing the Man-Headed Serpent's惨状, knew the power of the spear released by the Flawless Pearl. Seeing the spear approaching, they shrieked in terror and fled in panic.

The red mist fluctuated, and Shangguan Lifeng seized the opportunity to escape. However, Ge Yuan didn't appear.

From the time they were used as shields by Luo Xingnan to now, it hadn't been long. But the Hooked Serpents' strength far surpassed theirs.  It seemed Ge Yuan had been devoured, while Shangguan Lifeng was in a dreadful state.

His left arm was severed at the shoulder, not bitten off, but ripped away. The stump bore clear marks from the Hooked Serpents' tail hooks. The blood flowing from the wound was jet black. Fortunately, Shangguan Lifeng, knowing the Hooked Serpents' venom, had sealed his meridians in time, preventing the toxin from entering his vital organs. Otherwise, he would be beyond saving.

He was covered in wounds, his Qi Sea depleted. He had persevered until now with sheer willpower and a long saber.

Having severely wounded the Man-Headed Serpent and scared off the Hooked Serpents, the Flawless Pearl's power was nearly exhausted.

Yun Youzi retrieved the Flawless Pearl. Suddenly, his body went limp, and he began to fall.

Qin Sang reacted swiftly, catching Yun Youzi. He found Yun Youzi's breath extremely weak, as if he lacked the strength to speak. Without time to check his condition, Qin Sang swung him onto his back and, transforming into a streak of sword light, flew towards the exit.

Before collapsing, Yun Youzi had given Qin Sang the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat.  However, Qin Sang had tried and found that without Yun Youzi's assistance, piloting the flying boat alone consumed a terrifying amount of spiritual power, no less than the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman.

This was likely because he wasn't the flying boat's owner.

However, Yun Youzi had bought them enough time and space. They didn't need the flying boat to escape.

As he flew past Shangguan Lifeng, Qin Sang pulled him along.  Catching sight of Ge Yuan's storage pouch, he grabbed it and tucked it away.

"Thank you, Daoist..." Shangguan Lifeng's voice was weak as he struggled to speak his gratitude.

Luo Xingnan stood at the cave entrance, observing everything. He hadn't left directly. His gaze flickered as he watched Qin Sang and the others, his thoughts unknown.

Carrying two injured companions, Qin Sang kept his eyes fixed on Luo Xingnan, his expression cold and unwavering, as he flew on his sword.

Their gazes met in mid-air.

At this moment, the Hooked Serpents, realizing what had happened, let out enraged cries and pursued them again.

Luo Xingnan hesitated.  He took one last look at Qin Sang, then turned and walked into the cave, disappearing.

Qin Sang and the others flashed into the cave. They had studied the restrictive barrier when they entered and knew how to open it.

*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...*

Outside the hall, heavy rain poured down.

Inside, nothing had changed; it was exactly as when they first arrived.

Back then, seven people from Yu Kong's group alone had walked onto the rainbow bridge, followed by Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, making their numbers even greater.

Now, only five remained, two of them practically incapacitated.

Less than an hour had passed, yet it felt like a lifetime.

In the dilapidated hall, the two sides faced each other.

Luo Xingnan blocked the main entrance, half his body hidden in shadow.

Shangguan Lifeng sat on the ground, covered in blood and grime, focusing on healing. Yun Youzi lay on Qin Sang's back, seemingly asleep. It was unclear how he would recover, but it was certainly not possible now.

Qin Sang and the Scholar in White stood side by side.

"A talisman treasure, and a mysterious pearl... I've truly broadened my horizons today. Your identities are surely not simple, are they?" Luo Xingnan's eyes gleamed as he scrutinized Qin Sang.

"What do you intend to do by blocking the entrance?" Qin Sang's voice was icy, laced with sarcasm. "If I recall correctly, there's another Nascent Soul cultivator here.  Having gained your rewards, shouldn't you leave quickly?  Or do you feel you have too many thousand-year-old spiritual herbs and wish to offer them to that senior?"

Luo Xingnan snorted coldly, his eyes flashing, yet he dared not make any other move.

Thousand-year-old spiritual herbs would tempt even a Nascent Soul cultivator.

He wasn't confident he could subdue Qin Sang instantly. If the commotion of battle alerted the others and revealed their secret, neither side would fare well.

The rain intensified.

Qin Sang glanced outside the hall.

He noticed the spiritual energy in the air was incredibly chaotic, far more so than when they first entered. This indicated the protective formation's weakest period was about to end.

Luo Xingnan opened his mouth, about to speak.

Just then, a muffled sound echoed through the empty hall.

Everyone startled, turning their gazes towards the clay statue's hand.  Rainbow light suddenly burst forth from that location, accompanied by waves of energy.
