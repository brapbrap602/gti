<h1>Chapter 759: The Ancient Godly Platform</h1><p>Xiang Yi and the others stopped.</p><p>They arrived before the second stone hall.</p><p>It was similar to the first, only the ancient restrictions were different.</p><p>The Earth Spirit Banner could still break the restriction.</p><p>They cleared away the surrounding beasts, rested briefly, set up the Earth Spirit Banner, and began to try to break the restriction.</p><p>The earthquake caused by the Earth Spirit Banner was unavoidable, but this time everyone was clearly more alert, activating the spirit array while paying close attention to their surroundings.</p><p>No one wanted to repeat the same mistake and be surrounded and killed by beasts again.</p><p>Even if a second cultivator surnamed Pan appeared, they couldn't achieve such a good result again.</p><p>Qin Sang stood motionless in the distance, doing nothing.</p><p>The Earth Spirit Banner broke the ancient restriction. Xiang Yi flew into the stone hall, quickly came out, and whispered, "It's done! There's only one more stone hall left, fellow cultivators, follow me."</p><p>Xiang Yi changed direction; the third stone hall was closer to the rift.</p><p>The Bone Lotus was being eroded faster and faster; they quickened their pace.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the positions of these three stone halls followed a pattern, forming a perfect equilateral triangle. This ancient secret had been discovered by the East Pole League.</p><p>The third stone hall opened smoothly as well.</p><p>After Xiang Yi came out of the third stone hall, the ground suddenly began to tremble.</p><p>By this time, the Earth Spirit Banner had already been put away.</p><p>The source of this tremor was from the far distance and the deep underground. The vibrations were stronger and heavier, as if the earth had a strong, powerful heartbeat, reviving after the opening of the three stone halls.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and looked towards the center of the three stone halls; the tremors originated from there.</p><p>Xiang Yi seemed to have triggered some mechanism; something was emerging from there.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang sensed that Xiang Yi and the others suddenly turned and rushed towards him at high speed, racing towards the source of the tremor. He quickly dodged.</p><p>"The Ancient Godly Platform is emerging; it may alarm the surrounding beasts. Please, fellow cultivators, cooperate and protect me…"</p><p>Xiang Yi's voice came.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately followed.</p><p>Before reaching the source of the tremor, Qin Sang saw a mass of golden light in the distance.</p><p>The golden light was extremely dazzling, piercing through the purple mist, clearly visible even from this far distance. Moving closer, Qin Sang could vaguely see the outline of the Ancient Godly Platform.</p><p>The Ancient Godly Platform was seven or eight zhang high, narrower at the top and wider at the bottom, shaped like a tower. Around the platform, there were several thin golden rays, only faintly visible.</p><p>They had passed nearby before but hadn't noticed it.</p><p>The Ancient Godly Platform was so conspicuous; it was impossible not to see it. It must have just appeared, exhibiting this strange phenomenon.</p><p>Qin Sang stared for a moment and discovered that these golden rays were likely chains, extending from the top of the tower to the ground, one at each corner of the Ancient Godly Platform.</p><p>This scene seemed familiar.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recalled that in the Purple Micro Palace, when they followed Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan, the black tower they finally entered also had chains at each corner, very similar to this.</p><p>However, this Ancient Godly Platform was far less tall than the black tower on Mount Tianshan.</p><p>"Is it a coincidence?"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>Because he could only see the outline and not the details of the Ancient Godly Platform, he couldn't make a judgment.</p><p>Xiang Yi and the others had already arrived before the Ancient Godly Platform. Qin Sang stopped far away, watching quietly.</p><p>A large hole appeared in the ground.</p><p>‘Kaka…'</p><p>"Whoosh…"</p><p>The Ancient Stone Platform slowly rose from within, golden light shooting into the sky, extremely dazzling.</p><p>Everyone squinted, examining the Ancient Godly Platform.</p><p>The golden light didn't emanate from the Ancient Godly Platform itself, but from the ancient restrictions surrounding it. The Ancient Godly Platform looked ordinary; at first glance, it looked like a roughly carved stone platform.</p><p>The platform had layers of steps leading to the top, all square, the top roughly one zhang square.</p><p>It was empty on top; there were no doors or anything like that on the entire platform.</p><p>At each corner of the Ancient Godly Platform, a chain hung down, deeply embedded in the ground. As the Ancient Godly Platform rose, the chains gradually tightened, the "whoosh" sound being the chains swaying.</p><p>The chains were covered with runes, incredibly profound.</p><p>Strangely, these chains, which were clearly of extraordinary origin, were rusty, seemingly unable to withstand the erosion of endless years.</p><p>However, the runes on the chains still shone brightly, their divine power still present.</p><p>A muffled sound.</p><p>The Ancient Godly Platform rose completely out of the ground.</p><p>Everyone looked up, then looked at Xiang Yi.</p><p>Xiang Yi walked around the Ancient Godly Platform, took out six talismans, one for each person.</p><p>The six talismans were not exactly alike. Four of them depicted black dragons, their eyes lifelike. The other two were black jade cones, rather strange in shape.</p><p>The four black dragon talismans were given to the Liu couple, the young man with the sword, and Cui Ji. Xiang Yi and the fat man in fine clothes each held a jade cone talisman.</p><p>He positioned the Liu couple and the others at the four corners of the ancient altar, facing the iron chains. Then, he stood shoulder to shoulder with the richly dressed man, facing the altar's protective barrier.</p><p>"Daoist Liu," he said, "once Daoist An and I begin cracking the ancient barrier, you must fully activate the Azure-Black Dragon talismans to suppress the chains. It seems the beasts within the desolate land haven't been drawn here, so our pressure should be much less."</p><p>Xiang Yi finished his arrangements and nodded to the richly dressed man.</p><p>Together, they activated the jade cone talismans.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The talismans shattered, scattering fragments of paper.</p><p>A black light emerged, writhing and taking shape, eventually forming actual jade cones.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Both men shouted, and the jade cones vanished, reappearing instantly near the ancient altar.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The ancient altar's protective barrier activated under the impact of the jade cones, the golden light intensifying, bathing Xiang Yi and the others in its glow.</p><p>The jade cones, in turn, proved tenacious and sharp, their tips emitting a continuous stream of black energy, relentlessly assaulting the barrier.</p><p>At that moment, the iron chains at the four corners of the ancient altar moved without a breeze, their clanking echoing loudly.</p><p>Runes on the chains flickered, suddenly erupting in silver light.</p><p>Thunder surged from the chains!</p><p>Instantly, the rust vanished, replaced by writhing silver streaks, transforming the chains into thunderous whips exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>The lightning coiled, poised to strike, causing Xiang Yi's expression to change.</p><p>He clearly sensed the lightning was targeting him, a punishment for attacking the altar, its power immense. If the lightning struck, neither he nor the richly dressed man could withstand it.</p><p>Xiang Yi urgently shouted, "Quickly use the Black Dragon talismans to suppress the chains!"</p><p>The Liu couple and the others, without hesitation, immediately activated the Black Dragon talismans.</p><p>The moment the talismans shattered, earth-shattering dragon roars echoed.</p><p>A mass of black energy erupted from the talismans, instantly transforming into a genuine black dragon.  It soared through the clouds, claws outstretched, fiercely aggressive.</p><p>The dragon's eyes were intensely evil, giving an impression of extreme cruelty, like a demonic dragon from a hellish abyss, its body shrouded in black smoke and radiating boundless demonic energy.</p>
