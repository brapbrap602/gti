<h1>Chapter 2024: Gall Crystals</h1><p>A rhythmic pulsation emanated from within the Thousand Jun Ring, a steady beat like a heart resuming its rhythm, stirred from dormancy by some unknown presence in the tomb's depths.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't pinpoint the source of the ring's reaction.  He focused his senses, but felt no summoning, concluding it wasn't a living being. Otherwise, Qin Sang would have to carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards.</p><p>Seeing no immediate danger in the tomb passage, and noting the faded murals on the walls held no power, Steward Pei and Young Master Xin proceeded forward.</p><p>Qin Sang remained at the rear.</p><p>He hadn't intended to be embroiled in this affair.  His initial plan was to honor his agreement with Young Master Xin, fulfilling his part of the bargain as recompense for the Xin family cultivators scouting the way.</p><p>Events had taken an unexpected turn, making it impossible for him to withdraw.  This place was connected to the Thousand Jun Ring, and possibly a fragment of the Purple Firmament Palace. He had to uncover the truth.</p><p>The question remained: how did the Xin family find this place? Could they possess an object similar to the Thousand Jun Ring, something obtained from the Purple Firmament Palace, guiding them here?</p><p>Yet, Young Master Xin carried nothing that resonated with the ring.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, his gaze sweeping over the backs of Young Master Xin and Steward Pei.</p><p>With the situation unclear, he wouldn't reveal his purpose, choosing instead to observe. Even without Steward Pei present, he wouldn't directly question Young Master Xin. Her willingness to invite a Soul Formation cultivator to explore this place suggested she had something to rely on. The Xin family, capable of fielding so many Nascent Soul cultivators, clearly possessed a substantial foundation.</p><p>‘Thump… Thump… Thump…’</p><p>They deliberately emphasized their footsteps, the sounds echoing through the long passage, breaking the silence.  The path ahead remained quiet, devoid of forks, leading them smoothly to its end.</p><p>A blinding white light emanated from the end of the passage, dispelling the tomb's darkness.</p><p>They paused, peering through the exit, catching a glimpse of a patch of vibrant green grass beyond.</p><p>Clumps of aquatic grass floated on the surface of the water. The water seemed shallow, with sand visible beneath.  This type of environment was common in Dui Prefecture. Unexpectedly, they encountered it here.</p><p>The water's surface was undisturbed, not a ripple in sight. The tomb, so far, remained eerily silent, devoid of any apparent danger.</p><p>This tranquility heightened their vigilance. They stood their ground, cautiously extending their divine senses beyond the passage.</p><p>The scene that unfolded was astonishing. A vast lake stretched before them, its shallow waters mirroring the entrance, covered in lush aquatic grass.  Among the greenery, numerous statues stood erect.</p><p>The statues' bases matched those in the passage, but these remained intact.</p><p>Each stone platform bore the sculpted form of a bizarre beast. Creatures beyond imagination: a single-clawed Flood Dragon, a three-winged demonic bird, a bull with dozens of eyes on its head—these were among the most normal.</p><p>The beasts appeared lifelike, their eyes wide open, fixed on the passage exit, poised to pounce upon any intruder. The sight startled everyone, instinctively withdrawing their divine senses.</p><p>After a moment, the beasts remained inert.  Waiting further seemed pointless.  They had to enter the tomb, regardless of the dangers that lay ahead.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The instant they stepped out of the passage, a sharp sound pierced their ears.</p><p>“Careful!” Young Master Xin exclaimed, flicking her sleeve. A golden light shot out, transforming into a golden lock.</p><p>Several golden rings adorned the lock, jingling as they moved, projecting golden halos towards the source of the sound.</p><p>The sound originated from one of the statues, the three-winged demonic bird. Its wings were symmetrical, but a fleshy growth protruded from the base of its wings, sprouting a third wing that stood upright between the others, resembling a palm-leaf fan.</p><p>In a flash, golden light enveloped the bird statue.  Golden rings cascaded down, forming a cage in mid-air.</p><p>Young Master Xin's actions were a fraction too late.  Before the golden rings fully descended, the bird sprang to life, its eyes blazing with a terrifying ferocity. It flapped its wings, the central wing emitting a silver light capable of tearing through the void.  The bird vanished instantly.</p><p>Young Master Xin's expression shifted slightly.  She beckoned with a finger, and the golden lock snapped open, plummeting downwards. With a loud 'bang,' it struck the demonic bird, sending it crashing into the water, sending up a spray.</p><p>The demonic bird wasn't the only statue to awaken.  The three nearest statues leaped down simultaneously, charging towards them.</p><p>Having entered the tomb, Steward Pei had to act. He hadn't withdrawn his purple needle, now pointing it towards the brow of a beast.  Qin Sang didn't remain idle, directing his Gray Warbler Sword towards another beast. With only one beast remaining, the Xin family cultivators handled it with relative ease.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Qin Sang struck first, cleaving the beast in two. It instantly stiffened, falling into the water, reverting to two ordinary stone halves.</p><p>Next was the beast Steward Pei targeted. The purple needle pierced its brow, yet the beast showed no vital points.  Steward Pei changed his hand seals, causing purple light to erupt within the beast, dismembering it.  Only then was the beast vanquished, shattering into a pile of rubble.</p><p>The Xin family cultivators were jointly dealing with the last beast, seemingly close to victory.</p><p>"Not particularly strong..." Qin Sang inwardly assessed the beasts' strength, placing them at the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>With guardian beasts of this level, the tomb owner's status couldn't be too high.  If this was indeed part of the Purple Firmament Palace, it wouldn't be a particularly important area, differing from his expectations.</p><p>However, the guardian beasts' strength might have declined over time. They had only just entered, the true dangers likely lying ahead.</p><p>The four beasts were swiftly dispatched.  Then, cracking sounds filled the air as all the remaining statues came alive, leaping down from their platforms, rushing towards them, each wielding its unique abilities.</p><p>A chaotic display of light and energy ensued. Fortunately, the Xin family cultivators cooperated seamlessly, with Qin Sang and Steward Pei lending occasional assistance, eventually slaying all the beasts.</p><p>“Many thanks to Elder Qin and Steward Pei for resolving this crisis.  Otherwise, our Xin family would have suffered further losses," Young Master Xin said, hurrying forward after the fierce battle, without pausing to recover.</p><p>Steward Pei had a prior agreement, making his intervention obligatory. Qin Sang, however, was invited for refining.</p><p>“I, too, am curious about who would construct a tomb here. However, my safety must be guaranteed. Young Master Xin, don't place too much expectation on me," Qin Sang cautioned.</p><p>Young Master Xin nodded, producing a jade slip and handing it to Qin Sang.  “Elder Qin, this is one of the items we require you to refine. I've prepared the spirit materials. You can study it first.  When we find a suitable location, you can begin refining.”</p><p>“Only one?”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the jade slip, seemingly oblivious to Steward Pei's scrutinizing gaze.  A quick glance revealed the requested item was a magical artifact, a ferry boat.</p><p>He examined the details. Refining this ferry boat was merely complex, not particularly difficult for him, requiring only time. Qin Sang didn't inquire about the boat's purpose, focusing on studying the jade slip to avoid any missteps that might tarnish his reputation.</p><p>The shattered statues showed no signs of recovery.  The group crossed the lake, reaching the other side, where they found a stairway entrance.</p><p>Aquatic grass nearly choked the entrance.  After clearing the vegetation, they discovered stone steps leading downwards.</p><p>"It seems the tomb is layered. We're currently on the first level," Steward Luo speculated.</p><p>“There’s a seal inside!” A Xin family cultivator announced, having probed with their divine sense.</p><p>They filed in, encountering an ancient seal blocking their path. A brief examination revealed it shared the same origin as the restrictions on the stone gate.</p><p>As before, Young Master Xin stepped forward alone, placing her palm against the seal, requesting Steward Pei's assistance in breaking it.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang observed more closely. As the black light emerged, something seemed to appear in her palm. Young Master Xin masked it skillfully, using spellcasting as a cover, deceiving even him previously.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  “It seems the Xin family truly possesses something related to this place…”</p><p>The seal shattered under the purple needle's assault, revealing another tomb passage, similar in appearance to the previous one.</p><p>As they entered the passage, a faint fragrance wafted towards them.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt the pulsations within the Thousand Jun Ring intensify, the connection becoming clearer.  His heart stirred.  Deeper within, when the connection grew stronger, he might be able to use the ring to locate his target directly.  But unknown dangers lay ahead, and having this group scout the way was beneficial.</p><p>After confirming the fragrance was harmless, they emerged from the passage into a sea of flowers.</p><p>Countless blossoms bloomed in vibrant hues, a riot of color.</p><p>A buzzing sound filled the air.  Upon closer inspection, they discovered swarms of yellow wasps flitting among the flowers, diligently collecting nectar.</p><p>The number of wasps here far exceeded ten thousand, resembling yellow clouds drifting above the floral expanse.</p><p>These wasps were similar in size to ordinary wasps, seemingly posing no threat to cultivators.  However, upon seeing them, Steward Pei's expression turned grave, while Qin Sang frowned, as if recalling something.</p><p>While the Xin family cultivators remained oblivious, a jade ruyi zipped out of Steward Pei's sleeve.</p><p>Simultaneously, surprise flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. "They're Ritual Insects! Beware of illusions!" he exclaimed.</p><p>Young Master Xin reacted swiftly, flipping her hand to release a small bell.  All the Xin family cultivators immediately gathered around her.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The bell emitted a resonant chime.</p><p>The bell wasn't controlled by Young Master Xin alone.  All the Xin family cultivators channeled their energy into it, creating visible ripples that spread with the sound. Everyone felt their senses sharpen.</p><p>They might not entirely trust Qin Sang, but they wouldn't disregard any warning from a Soul Formation cultivator, even if it proved unnecessary.  It was better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang hadn't deceived them.</p><p>He recognized these wasps. They were Ritual Insects!</p><p>The term “Ritual Insect” originated from the Wu Clan, not referring to a specific insect but rather a category.</p><p>The Wu Clan's Insect Gu Ranking listed insects suitable for becoming lifebound companions. However, their study of insect control wasn't limited to this.  Many swarm-type insects could also serve them.</p><p>The few Wu Clan texts Qin Sang had encountered mentioned these Ritual Insects. Ancient Wu Clan tribes would, at specific times, conduct ceremonies led by their Great Witches to worship the heavens and deities.  These rituals sometimes involved insects, known as Ritual Insects, which held a revered position within the tribe, enjoying the same reverence as the Great Witches.</p><p>These Ritual Insects often shared similar traits, excelling in illusion and mind-altering techniques. Qin Sang speculated this might be to immerse the tribe members in the ceremony, allowing them to worship wholeheartedly.</p><p>These wasps were a type of Ritual Insect.</p><p>"Wu Clan Ritual Insects here? Could my initial guess be correct?  Is this the tomb of a Wu Clan Grandmaster?" Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>What was the true origin of this place? Could there be remnants of the Wu Clan within the Purple Firmament Palace?</p><p>Legend spoke of human sword cultivators battling across the boundary walls.  But the otherworldly demons were enemies of the entire Great Thousand World.  Could righteous individuals from the Wu Clan have joined Venerable Purple Firmament Sword in that war?</p><p>Almost as soon as Qin Sang gave his warning, the Ritual Insects detected them. The yellow clouds abruptly solidified, all the wasps turning to face them. The buzzing intensified, becoming incredibly shrill.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A fierce wind erupted as the yellow clouds expanded with alarming speed, engulfing the surroundings in a hazy yellow.</p><p>Steward Pei's jade ruyi radiated a clear light, repelling the yellow clouds.</p><p>The bell chimed incessantly, each chime more urgent than the last.  The ripples fought against the yellow cloud, forced into a defensive posture, gradually shrinking inwards.  The Xin family cultivators felt a chill, grateful for Qin Sang's timely warning.</p><p>Protected by his jade Buddha, Qin Sang remained unaffected.  Still, he put on a show, transmitting his voice, "Ritual Insects are only threatening in swarms. Individually, they aren't strong. Hold your ground and exterminate them separately."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the Gray Warbler Sword slashed into the swarm.</p><p>Having successfully weathered the Ritual Insects' initial attack, the group remained unharmed.  Following Qin Sang's command, they began their assault.  But then they saw Qin Sang leave his position, flying towards the heart of the swarm on his sword.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that Ritual Insects nurtured through secret Wu Clan techniques could produce a treasure called Gall Crystals, a rare and valuable medicine for insect control.  Feeding Gall Crystals to spirit insects offered numerous benefits.  However, cultivating Ritual Insects was incredibly difficult, achievable only by the largest Wu Clan tribes.</p><p>Trapped here for countless years, these Ritual Insects should have left behind some Gall Crystals.</p><p>With the Gray Warbler Sword clearing the way, he plunged into the densest part of the swarm, spotting a flowering tree. The flowers, the size of a baby's fist, had a peculiar shape, resembling round-necked jugs hanging from the branches.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately noticed that among them, a dozen or so jugs appeared more crystalline, as if transformed into jade over countless years.</p><p>These jugs were filled with something.</p><p>A joyful expression appeared on Qin Sang's face. He flashed to the tree, peering into one of the jugs.  It was filled with pale yellow crystals, brimming to the top.</p><p>Gall Crystals!</p><p>Normal Gall Crystals had a honey-like consistency, but these had solidified into hard crystals.</p><p>The quantity was less than he'd anticipated, not enough to fill the entire tree.  But these crystalized Gall Crystals seemed purer than those described in texts, suggesting their potency might have changed.</p>
