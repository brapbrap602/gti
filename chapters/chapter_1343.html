<h1></h1><p>Avoiding the red foxes,</p><p>Qin Sang walked a short distance to the right and saw the remnants of a broken illusion formation ahead. He felt an extremely sharp aura, the sword energy growing denser the further he went.</p><p>This place was still some distance from the sword scar.</p><p>Sword energy crisscrossed the void, and devilish winds howled, forming a veritable sword domain, extremely dangerous.  He could go no further. Qin Sang had no doubt that if he carelessly strayed into the sword domain, he would perish instantly.</p><p>He observed the sword energy, testing it cautiously. Seeing that the sword energy didn't seem to deliberately target anything outside the illusion formation, a plan formed in his mind.  His gaze swept over the surroundings, and with a flash of light from the Thousand Jun Ring, he retrieved a triangular blue banner.</p><p>Qin Sang had learned the refining methods of many magical instruments and treasures from the Mystic Spirit Sect's scriptures. Some of these treasures were not of high quality, but their uses were quite unique. Qin Sang picked out a few that might be useful and refined them for himself. The blue banner was one of them.</p><p>The blue banner was only the size of a palm.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the blue banner into the air, consecutively striking several hand seals. A faint ripple, like water, spread out, and then the blue banner vanished into thin air.</p><p>In the next moment, a ripple suddenly appeared in the void, and a Water Kirin leaped out, walking on waves. Its horns were prominent and majestic, a truly awe-inspiring sight.</p><p>The Water Kirin was entirely azure, formed of water.</p><p>Its eyes flashed with a ferocious light, and it let out a low growl, seeming to possess a violent temperament.  In reality, it had no sentience of its own; it was an illusory beast manifested by the blue banner.</p><p>This beast wasn't powerful, but it had one advantage: as long as the water essence wasn't extinguished, it could regenerate at will, making it suitable for luring beasts and insects with low intelligence.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Water Kirin, glanced towards the dense forest, and withdrew.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The Water Kirin, majestic and imposing, paced back and forth on its four hooves, occasionally roaring at the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for a while. Surprisingly, there was no movement from the dense forest.  His thoughts raced, and he understood the reason.  The illusion formation was broken, and the red foxes' range of perception was also limited.</p><p>He pondered for a moment, walked back a short distance, and, raising the Ebony Sword, sent a surge of sword energy towards the dense forest.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Several towering trees were cut in half, collapsing with a thunderous crash.</p><p>With such a loud commotion, it was impossible for the red foxes not to react.</p><p>This thought had just flashed through Qin Sang's mind when several red streaks suddenly appeared in his vision, shooting out from the dense forest in an instant, as fast as meteors!</p><p>Such speed!</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly startled. Even with his cultivation, he couldn't clearly see the red foxes' figures. They were faster than his Thunder Escape technique!</p><p>If his true body were discovered by the red foxes, he would have no chance of escape.</p><p>Even more alarming, after these few red foxes were startled, they emitted sharp cries, and then a rustling sound came from the entire dense forest.</p><p>Red figures rushed out from the depths of the forest, one after another.</p><p>These seemingly adorable red foxes now appeared incredibly ferocious, their baleful aura soaring to the heavens.</p><p>“Fortunately, I was careful enough, otherwise I would have been torn to shreds by these little things.”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of relief and quickly looked towards the Water Kirin's location.</p><p>The red foxes, rushing out of the dense forest, were provoked by the Water Kirin.  Their eyes filled with a crimson hue, they fell into a frenzy and pounced forward with a chorus of shrieks.</p><p>Just as these red foxes were about to reach the Water Kirin,</p><p>the sword energy floating in the void seemed to be stimulated by something. Suddenly, it shone brightly, emitting a buzzing sound, and an astonishing sword intent erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was shaken by the sword intent. Before he could see what had happened, he saw the red foxes' bodies severed in two, tumbling to the ground, then turning into mist and dissipating. The red foxes behind them continued to charge forward relentlessly, only to be wiped out.</p><p>He clearly sensed that after the red foxes died, a strange power began to brew in the depths of the forest.</p><p>Sure enough, these red foxes were endless.  The illusion formation could give birth to new ones at any time, and the brief interval was his opportunity.</p><p>The sword energy detonated, and the blue banner itself was destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his hiding place, transforming into a bolt of lightning as he rushed into the dense forest, speeding between the ancient trees.</p><p>Surrounded by swirling mist, he dared not look closely, fully urging his Thunder Escape technique. In one breath, he dashed out of the dense forest. At the moment he left, he caught a glimpse of a red shadow, just beginning to take form.</p><p>“Whew!”</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled.  His heart had been in his throat, but thankfully, he had succeeded.</p><p>The red foxes played together again, and the forest returned to its tranquility.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the ground, glanced back, then looked towards the stone hall ahead.  The Nanming Li Fire was within.</p><p>The sword scar pierced through the stone hall. Now the range affected by the sword energy had expanded. Fortunately, it hadn't completely destroyed the stone hall, and the previous entrance was still there.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang sensed the aggrieved thoughts of the Celestial Eye Butterfly.</p><p>“Finally back to normal.”</p><p>Qin Sang comforted the Celestial Eye Butterfly, then summoned the Nascent Soul Puppet and walked towards the stone hall.</p><p>Stepping into the stone hall, a wave of heat washed over him.</p><p>“This aura…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed slightly. It was the Nanming Li Fire!</p><p>The Nanming Li Fire had been sealed deep within the secret passage.  Previously, one had to open the secret passage to sense its aura, but now it was affecting the area outside the passage.</p><p>“With the resurgence of the immortal realm, the Nanming Li Fire has also been affected. I hope nothing unexpected happens.”</p><p>Qin Sang prayed silently, quickly walking towards the entrance of the secret passage, activating the restriction on the floor tiles.</p><p>The secret passage opened.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>An astonishing demonic fire aura, pent up within the passage, finally broke free, erupting outwards.</p><p>Qin Sang was alert and dodged aside just as a fire dragon fiercely charged out, nearly brushing past him, rushing out of the hall and exploding in mid-air.</p><p>After the force dissipated, Qin Sang looked down at the secret passage.</p><p>“If it's just a demonic fire eruption, it shouldn't affect the subjugation. I have to go down and take a look no matter what…”</p><p>He pondered for a moment, ordering the Nascent Soul Puppet to go ahead and bear the brunt of the impact.  At the same time, he deployed the Eighteen Devil Banners, covering his entire body in a demonic fire armor.</p><p>Layers of protection, combined with his powerful physique,</p><p>made Qin Sang feel somewhat more confident.  He prepared the magical treasures he had refined for subduing the demonic fire and stepped into the secret passage.</p><p>The aura of the Nanming Li Fire continuously emanated outwards. Fortunately, it hadn't exceeded the limits of his cultivation. Even so, Qin Sang felt unbearably hot, sweat pouring down like rain, and his True Essence was being consumed at a rapid pace.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang reached the end of the secret passage and saw the true form of the Nanming Li Fire. His heart sank.</p><p>Originally just a ball of flame, it had now expanded into a massive fireball. This wasn't an illusion created by the demonic fire’s aura; it was its true form erupting!</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously approached, gazing at the demonic fire's true form.</p><p>When Cloud Wanderer had cast himself into the Nanming Li Fire and been reborn in the flames, he had made a new discovery. The Nanming Li Fire was stored within a stone chamber resembling an alchemy room. Within the stone chamber, remnants of ancient restrictions remained, capable of restraining it.</p><p>Looking closely, one could see thin golden threads crawling all over the stone walls, emitting a strange fluctuation, exerting a certain suppressive effect on the Nanming Li Fire.</p><p>The demonic fire was erupting, colliding with the ancient restrictions!</p><p>However, what most attracted Qin Sang’s attention wasn’t these, but a point of intensely concentrated red light within the demonic fire’s core.</p><p>A feather!
