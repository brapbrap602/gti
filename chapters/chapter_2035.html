<h1>Chapter 2026: Between a Rock and a Hard Place</h1><p>Dark clouds pressed down, and the group hurriedly fled as lightning bolts incessantly crashed around them.  When they crossed a certain boundary, the dark clouds and lightning simultaneously vanished behind them. The sky remained gloomy, but the sea surface calmed, the danger seemingly distant.</p><p>But just as everyone breathed a sigh of relief, preparing to continue onward, the sky ahead grew darker and darker. The void trembled, ripples spread across the sea, and the path before them was swallowed by pitch black.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Darkness descended.</p><p>Everyone stared, watching as black water surged towards them like a tide, blotting out the sky and sun.</p><p>With no time to think, the group hastily prepared for battle.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Gray Warbler Sword, suspending it before him, his attention fixed on Young Mistress Xin.  He saw Young Mistress Xin issue a command, gathering the Xin family cultivators around her.</p><p>Immediately following, the shadow behind Young Mistress Xin stirred, taking on a human-like form.  Its legs were at Young Mistress Xin’s feet, the portion above its knees pressed against the back of a Xin family cultivator behind her.  It resembled Young Mistress Xin’s silhouette, moving with her steps, except this shadow was alive.</p><p>“Is this the Gloom Spirit?”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished. In his perception, the Gloom Spirit’s body wasn’t physical, yet it wasn't like ordinary spirits either.  Those unaware might mistake it for a true shadow.</p><p>This shadow named Gloom Spirit possessed powerful divine abilities. It was unclear whether it was inherently a shadow, or a special being capable of merging with Young Mistress Xin’s silhouette.</p><p>Some believe that everyone is born with a shadow, not merely a simple interplay of light and darkness.  In some legends, shadows are imbued with various mystical properties, giving rise to concepts like Shadow Gods.</p><p>As the black tide surged, the Gloom Spirit raised an arm, using its hand as a blade, and slashed downwards at the black tide!</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The black tide was instantly cleaved, a gap appearing.  The Xin family cultivators, working together, steered a flying treasure through the gap before it closed.</p><p>Every time they were about to be engulfed by the black tide, the Gloom Spirit would raise its arm and strike, using simple slashing techniques to lead them through the waves, without displaying further divine abilities.</p><p>Beyond the black tide, other trials awaited, one after another, continuous and relentless, giving them no respite.  Fortunately, these dangers were only troublesome; their power didn’t exceed the previous Crescent Moon Lightning.</p><p>With Elder Pei, Qin Sang, and the Xin family's Gloom Spirit, equivalent to three Void Refinement cultivators joining forces, they navigated the numerous obstacles without incident, finally seeing a different scene in the next space.</p><p>Every space here, regardless of the danger it held, was a monotonous black sea.  The area ahead was no different, but amidst the boundless black sea, shadows rose from the surface, undulating – islands.</p><p>The islands stretched out, hundreds visible within their field of vision alone, with countless more beyond. There were no buildings on the islands, not even a single blade of grass; they were all bare, rocky islands.</p><p>The stone islands, large and small, stood in multitudes, the largest no bigger than a mountain.</p><p>Facing this 'sea of mountains,' everyone, having just passed through layers of trials, grew wary. After a while, they found only these islands standing quietly before them.</p><p>Desolate, silent!</p><p>Confirming there was no immediate danger, everyone carefully observed the archipelago.</p><p>After gazing for a moment, a strange, indescribable feeling arose in Qin Sang's heart. It was as if the archipelago was alive, ready to awaken at any moment, transforming into stone giants and charging towards them.</p><p>This feeling didn’t originate from any single island but from the entire archipelago, as if the islands formed a grand formation.</p><p>He was certain these islands weren’t simple and shouldn't be trespassed upon lightly, but some things remained uncertain. He couldn’t sense the fluctuations of a spirit formation on these islands, nor had he ever seen such a formation.</p><p>Qin Sang placed his hands behind his back, his expression unchanged, gently rubbing the Thousand Jun Ring with his left hand.</p><p>Just now, the ring’s fluctuations had suddenly intensified. Qin Sang now had a clear sense that the object causing the ring’s reaction was deep within this archipelago.</p><p>“If it’s just a simple illusion formation, I should be able to find it relying solely on the Thousand Jun Ring's fluctuations…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, glancing at Young Mistress Xin and Elder Pei.</p><p>If he were to leave the group and act alone, he needed a reasonable excuse. Moreover, the dangers hidden within were still unknown; it was best to err on the side of caution.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his curiosity and suddenly saw Young Mistress Xin fly forward, a look of urgency on her face.</p><p>“Is it here?” Elder Pei’s eyes flashed as he caught up and asked.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin nodded slightly, took a deep breath, and said, “This should be the place my father spoke of. We’ve finally found it! But we still need to verify…”</p><p>As she spoke, Young Mistress Xin scanned the islands, mentally calculating, and fixed her gaze on one of them.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The group flew towards the island.</p><p>This island was one of the outermost, its terrain steep, like a sharp sword unsheathed, pointing towards the heavens.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin stared at the island, her eyes gleaming.  Her figure flickered, and just as she was about to fly towards the back of the mountain, she suddenly remembered something. Turning to Qin Sang and Elder Pei, she said confidently, “There’s no mistake, it’s this mountain!”</p><p>Saying this, Young Mistress Xin took out a scroll and slowly unfurled it, revealing a painting. The scroll had clearly been remounted, the original image drawn on an unknown animal hide, clearly not a contemporary piece.</p><p>The drawing was simple, with only rudimentary lines, difficult for ordinary people to understand. However, in one corner of the image, a few strokes outlined the shape of a mountain, very similar to the one before them.</p><p>After careful comparison, Qin Sang noticed it wasn't entirely identical; the drawing likely depicted the back of the mountain.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin was precisely going to the back of the mountain to verify.  She said in a deep voice, “Once we cross this line, there might be changes. Elder Pei, Elder Qin, if we encounter danger, please lend me your assistance!”</p><p>“We’ll handle what comes after; you needn’t be distracted.”</p><p>Qin Sang and Elder Pei readily agreed, summoning their spirit treasures, protecting the Xin family cultivators within.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin nodded and flew towards the back of the mountain first, the others following closely.</p><p>As expected, as they flew over the island, the situation changed dramatically.</p><p>In an instant, fierce winds howled, the sky darkened, thunder rumbled above, and the sea churned with waves.  Not only did the environment undergo a drastic transformation, but the surrounding islands also became blurred.</p><p>An uncomfortable feeling arose in everyone’s hearts. An invisible pressure seemed to weigh down on them from above, instinctively forcing them to lower their altitude, skimming the sea surface.  Then they realized that their divine sense and vision were also restricted.</p><p>The farther the distance, the harder it became to see the islands, their forms flickering and indistinct.  Upon closer inspection, the distant islands seemed to be moving, the environment constantly shifting, becoming increasingly mysterious and elusive.</p><p>Fortunately, the formation didn't attack them.  The group paused, flew to the back of the mountain, and compared it with the painting. Indeed, every detail matched.</p><p>Now, comparing the surrounding environment with the painting, they immediately had a completely different understanding.  All the chaotic lines could be matched with the landscape, like a treasure map that was, in reality, a formation diagram.</p><p>But Elder Pei quickly discovered a flaw, frowning. “This map seems incomplete?”</p><p>Indeed, the area depicted on the map shouldn't extend too far beyond their field of vision, but based on their observations, this archipelago should be much vaster.  With this map alone, they certainly couldn’t reach the very center.</p><p>Unless the core of the archipelago wasn't at its center, there should be other maps; this was just one of them.</p><p>“Don't worry, Elder Pei! My father said that as long as we reach this point, there will be a way.”</p><p>Young Mistress Xin pointed to a location on the map, identified the route, and set off impatiently. The others could only follow, weaving between the islands, moving against the wind and waves.</p><p>This place wasn't as perilous as they had imagined. They traveled for a long time without encountering any danger, as if it were merely a maze, and they, guided by the map, knew its changes and didn’t need to worry about getting lost.</p><p>They drew closer and closer to their target.</p><p>Just as they passed between two islands, Young Mistress Xin’s brows furrowed slightly.  Qin Sang and Elder Pei also sensed something. They abruptly shouted to halt, and the Gray Warbler Sword and Jade Ruyi were unleashed simultaneously, azure light and sword light striking the same point in the void.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The void distorted, a muffled sound like flesh being struck echoed, and a grayish figure tumbled out.</p><p>The figure materialized, resembling a tiger or leopard.  It was clearly injured by the blow, crashing onto the mountain and rolling clumsily, but it didn’t utter a single cry of pain.  It scrambled to its feet, attempting to flee.</p><p>Qin Sang and Elder Pei wouldn’t allow its escape. The Gray Warbler Sword split into four beams of sword light, trapping it within.  The Jade Ruyi descended from above, firmly imprisoning the creature.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a bizarre scene unfolded.  The struggling creature, unable to break free, suddenly shattered like a bubble, leaving behind only a fingernail-sized jade shard, which was enveloped by the Jade Ruyi and brought back, leaving everyone staring at each other in bewilderment.</p><p>“What is this thing?” Elder Pei frowned, holding the jade shard.</p><p>“It doesn't seem like a living being.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, recalling the creature's behavior.</p><p>The jade shard was slightly cloudy.  Such a small piece unexpectedly exuded an ancient aura, as if it were a fragment chipped off an ancient jade.  Yet, this jade fragment could transform into a living creature, truly bizarre.</p><p>At this moment, Young Mistress Xin took the jade shard, her brows knitting together tightly.  She clearly knew something but offered no explanation, only increasing their speed.</p><p>They encountered no further obstacles and smoothly reached their destination.  Before them was an island mountain, its body split in two, forming a deep canyon.</p><p>Everyone cautiously flew into the canyon, where they saw vegetation for the first time in this place.</p><p>A stream flowed through the canyon, black spring water gurgling out and merging with the sea.  On both sides of the stream grew peculiar spirit trees.</p><p>These spirit trees were only a person's height, but their trunks were extremely thick, like plump wooden stumps.  Slender branches sprouted from their tops, bearing palm-sized black leaves with golden veins, like inlaid gold threads.</p><p>“Elder Qin, please look,” Young Mistress Xin beckoned Qin Sang forward.</p><p>Qin Sang had been staring at these spirit trees since entering the canyon. “In the jade slip, the nameless spirit wood used to refine the hull, is it this spirit tree?”</p><p>“Precisely!”</p><p>Young Mistress Xin nodded.  “This tree only grows here.  Elder Qin, please gather the materials here and refine the ferry.”</p><p>“Young Mistress Xin, do you mean that by riding a ferry refined from this spirit wood, we can reach the center of the archipelago?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>He looked towards the other side of the canyon, beyond the sliver of sky, at the shadows of several islands.</p><p>After entering the formation, the Thousand Jun Ring reacted even more strongly.  He could traverse the maze without a ferry, but he didn't know if the ring’s indication was truly the archipelago's center.</p><p>“Logically, it should be so…”</p><p>Young Mistress Xin frowned, looking towards the source of the black spring.</p><p>Gurgling spring water bubbled from the spring’s eye.  She flashed to the edge of the spring, her true essence transforming into a large hand, reaching into the spring’s eye, but only grasping a handful of sand and stones.</p><p>Unwilling to give up, she tried several more times, finally sighing. “Just as I thought!”</p><p>“What’s going on?!” Elder Pei demanded.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin flipped her palm, revealing the jade shard. “My father said that not only does the spirit wood for refining the ferry grow here, but there is also a jade disc placed here. By integrating the jade disc into the hull during refinement, we can freely traverse this formation and reach our final destination. But the jade disc is gone…”</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone looked at the jade shard in Young Mistress Xin’s hand.</p><p>It was evident that the jade disc had shattered and undergone a transformation, becoming those strange jade spirits.</p><p>“So, we need to find all those jade shards to refine the ferry?” Elder Pei and Qin Sang exchanged glances, both feeling troubled.</p><p>They didn’t know how many pieces the jade disc had shattered into; they had only encountered one jade spirit along the way.</p><p>Moreover, they only possessed a portion of the formation diagram.  If the jade spirits wandered elsewhere, they couldn’t venture out recklessly.  But without the jade shards, they couldn’t refine the ferry, creating a deadlock.</p><p>“This is the only way.”</p><p>Young Mistress Xin said helplessly, “Hopefully, by finding a portion of the jade shards, we can create a rudimentary ferry, granting it some power.  We can then use it to hunt for more jade spirits until we gather the entire jade disc. Elder Qin, please focus on refining the hull here; we will go and search for the jade shards.”</p><p>Elder Pei disagreed with Young Mistress Xin’s suggestion, saying calmly, “In my opinion, this place is full of strangeness and related to the Witch Clan.  There might be hidden dangers yet to be revealed. It’s best not to separate. Elder Qin should join us in hunting for the jade spirits first; it won’t be too late to refine the hull afterwards.”</p><p>“I’m afraid we don’t have much time.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, pointing to the spirit trees by the spring. “Has Elder Pei not noticed? The leaves of these spirit trees are withering; their spiritual essence is dissipating.”</p><p>Everyone was startled by these words.  They looked closely and, indeed, just as Qin Sang had said, the luster on the leaves had subtly dimmed compared to before.</p><p>“Why are they withering at this particular moment?” Elder Pei’s sharp gaze swept towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang merely stated the facts. “Perhaps because we intruded, triggering some mechanism. The formation has already begun to operate, but we haven’t noticed it yet.”</p><p>After the spirit trees withered, who knew what other changes would occur.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin didn't dare delay any longer.  “The spirit trees are withering. Please, both elders, gather the materials quickly.  I don't understand the art of refining, so I will take people out to hunt for the jade spirits.”</p><p>Elder Pei frowned, watching Young Mistress Xin’s departing figure, and suddenly called out, “Wait! Elder Qin alone is sufficient.  Leave two people to protect Elder Qin; I will go with you.”</p><p>“Thank you, Elder Pei,” Young Mistress Xin said, overjoyed.</p><p>Seeing the joy on Young Mistress Xin’s face, Elder Pei’s gaze shifted back and forth between Qin Sang and her.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin had left on her own, yet Qin Sang showed no reaction.</p><p>Elder Pei’s suspicions deepened, leaving him feeling caught between a rock and a hard place.</p>
