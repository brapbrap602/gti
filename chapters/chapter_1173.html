<h1>Chapter 1165: Demon Kings' Council</h1><p>"Establishing a sect is truly no simple task."</p><p>After settling matters with the Blazing Demon Sect, Qin Sang set off on his return journey. Reflecting on the busy days he had just endured, he couldn't help but feel a sense of weariness and sighed inwardly. As the leader of a sect, his words carried immense weight, and his commands were followed without question. The adoration of thousands of disciples was indeed a gratifying experience, but it wasn't what he truly sought. His original intention had been to take on a few capable disciples and leave it at that.</p><p>Fortunately, he now had several competent individuals under his command. Li Yufu and Mei Gu were both capable of handling major responsibilities on their own and could become the backbone of the sect in the future. Zhao Shanran and Tan Yi'en, though less talented, were not a concern for Qin Sang, as he had no shortage of Demon Core Pills and intended to help them form their Golden Cores. Both of them had good temperaments—one assisted Mei Gu in managing sect affairs, while the other, being socially adept, was well-suited to handling the trivial matters both within and outside the sect.</p><p>Moreover, the Green Goat Temple, similar to the Spirit Taming Sect, possessed unique advantages that other sects couldn't match. By allying with the demon tribes of the Thousand Bamboo Sea, the disciples of the sect could attempt to gain the recognition of spirit beasts, thereby establishing a sect that spanned both human and demon races. As long as the ancient teleportation array remained intact, there would be a steady supply of Demon Core Pills in the future.</p><p>Of course, compared to other renowned sects, the Green Goat Temple still had a long way to go, especially in terms of heritage and disciples. Even Li Yufu, the most advanced in cultivation, was only at the early Golden Core stage, far from reaching the Nascent Soul stage. Qin Sang was well aware that these things couldn't be rushed. With him at the helm, the Green Goat Temple's strength would continue to grow. The framework had already been established; all that was needed was to find a place rich in spiritual energy to serve as the sect's headquarters.</p><p>In the future, Qin Sang wouldn't devote too much energy to the sect. His own cultivation was the foundation of everything.</p><p>On his way back, Qin Sang once again detoured to Shaohua Mountain, hoping to meet Mu Yifeng. He hadn't seen him the last time he visited. Mu Yifeng had become an ascetic, often in seclusion. Back then, Qin Sang hadn't dared to contact Mu Yifeng recklessly, as it might have implicated him. This time, Shaohua Mountain had already been sealed off, and Qin Sang still didn't get to see him in person.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang decided not to press the matter. He was certain to head to the frontlines, and if Mu Yifeng was also there, they would have a chance to meet. Qin Sang's strength was no longer what it used to be, and he was confident he could ensure Mu Yifeng's safety.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang returned to the Yuan Shen Sect, planning to complete the first step of his cultivation technique—projecting the Sword Soul through the Killing Talisman—before taking any further action. However, upon his return, he found that the gluttonous and lustful bird duo had arrived and had been waiting for him for many days.</p><p>"Master! You've finally returned! This humble servant has been waiting for so long! A day without seeing you feels like three years. A year without seeing you feels like..."</p><p>The fat chicken rushed over, its face full of flattery, spouting endless words. Halfway through, it realized it was only moving its mouth without making any sound. Seeing Qin Sang's displeased expression, it quickly shut its mouth, knowing better than to continue.</p><p>"Where's the white crane? Didn't it come with you?" Qin Sang had just asked when he heard a crane's cry in the distance. The white crane and a colorful spirit bird were flying side by side. Midway, the white crane elegantly waved its wings, bidding farewell to the spirit bird, which let out a mournful cry, reluctant to part.</p><p>"Greetings, Master," the white crane said respectfully, not daring to act too flamboyantly in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, "You dare to flirt around even in human territory? It seems you've grown tired of living! Weren't you only interested in descendants of the Phoenix Clan? How could a mere spirit bird, just awakened to its demonic nature, captivate you so?"</p><p>The white crane sighed deeply. "The demon tribes of this realm are too disappointing. Not a single descendant of the Phoenix bloodline can be found, so I had to settle for less. Though she is only a low-level demon, her feathers are exceptionally well-formed, straight and smooth, with clear patterns. The curve of her beak is breathtaking, especially enchanting. While she has her flaws—her feathers aren't vibrant enough, the color patches are too chaotic, and her voice isn't clear—she is still quite rare..."</p><p>As it spoke, the crane smacked its lips, its expression tinged with melancholy. Stranded in this place, it had no idea when it would return to its homeland in glory. Qin Sang had even imposed a gag order on it, forbidding it from mentioning anything about the Demon Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang's eye twitched. The lustful bird spoke so eloquently, but he couldn't see what made that spirit bird any more beautiful than the others.</p><p>"Enough. What's the matter?" Qin Sang ignored the crane's melancholy and turned to the fat chicken.</p><p>"Reporting to Master, Elder Liu sent us here. The Feather Demon King has sent word that a council will soon be held in the Ten Thousand Demon City, inquiring if you and Senior Bamboo Demon have the time to attend. It's not mandatory," the fat chicken said, handing Qin Sang a jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. "Has there been any change in the war situation?"</p><p>The fat chicken hesitated. "Elder Monkey just sent back news. Everything seems normal on the frontlines."</p><p>After reading the jade slip, Qin Sang learned that one of the purposes of this council was related to the Purple Palace. After a moment of contemplation, he nodded. "Very well. Go back and tell Elder Liu that I will personally visit the Ten Thousand Demon City."</p><p>"Master, Master..." The fat chicken, full of flattery, leaned in. "If you disguise yourself as a demon king, wouldn't it weaken your presence if you didn't have a mount or attendants by your side? Our cultivation isn't bad. Why not let us stay by your side? We can handle minor tasks for you."</p><p>"Bootlicker!" The white crane couldn't stand it anymore, muttering under its breath, but it still trotted over eagerly.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang agreed. The fat chicken had been wandering the demon realm for many years. Bringing them along would prevent him from making mistakes due to his unfamiliarity with the demon territories.</p><p>Qin Sang decided not to return to the Yuan Shen Sect and instead headed north again, now accompanied by two birds. Along the way, they passed by Li Yufu's cave.</p><p>Li Yufu and Tan Yi'en came out to greet him and shared some good news.</p><p>"Uncle-Master, Han Qiu has sensed the opportunity to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage and is currently in seclusion attempting it."</p><p>"That's good. This is likely her last chance. I hope she can seize it. Yi'en, I previously asked you to contact your father's old acquaintances. Have you made any progress?" Qin Sang turned to Tan Yi'en.</p><p>Tan Yi'en replied, "In recent years, following your instructions, I've contacted a few of my father's old friends or their families. Some have died unexpectedly, while others are stuck at the Foundation Establishment stage, nearing the end of their lifespans and having long since cut ties with my father. However, from their accounts, I confirmed that two seniors were in close contact with my father during his final years. Both were Golden Core cultivators—one a rogue cultivator, the other a disciple of a major sect. However, both have been sent to the frontlines, so it's difficult to reach them for now."</p><p>"The frontlines?" Qin Sang's heart stirred. "I'm planning to visit the Heavenly Demon Hills. After that, I intend to take a look at the frontlines. Yi'en, you go ahead and wait for me at Cangheng Island. We'll go together. Yufu, during my recent trip to the demon territories, I took on a disciple. I had once left a seed in the demon territories, and it has now grown into a tree... You can go and assist them when you have time. Get to know them, as the Blazing Demon Sect will eventually merge with the Green Goat Temple."</p><p>Hearing this, Li Yufu's face lit up with joy. "I'll go tomorrow!"</p><p>Starting a sect was indeed a challenging task, and he had been racking his brains over the myriad complexities involved. With the foundation of the Blazing Demon Sect, developing the Green Goat Temple would be much easier.</p>
