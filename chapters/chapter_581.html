Chapter 574: The Inner Sanctum


Approaching the altar, its sheer size became apparent.  The lingering, bloody aura was as vivid as fresh blood, a chilling sight. Even without the ancient restrictions, few would dare venture into such a terrifying miasma.


After the Immortal Tomb, they faced several other perilous locations, but none as daunting as the Ghost King within the tomb.  The tomb seemed to be the most dangerous trial.  Beyond it, the remaining dangers were manageable for Golden Core cultivators, provided they were cautious.


They also encountered unique ancient formations that required them to proceed individually, forcing them apart. However, Duke Dongyang had prepared talismans and artifacts to aid Qin Sang and the others, allowing them to overcome these challenges with minimal risk.


Duke Dongyang and Chen Yan had a single, clear objective: the Inner Sanctum!  Nothing else piqued their interest. They ignored the strange lights and hidden realms they encountered along the way, heading straight for their destination with utmost speed.


Naturally, Qin Sang was delighted. The faster Duke Dongyang was, the sooner they reached the Inner Sanctum, and the fewer rivals they would face when harvesting the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit. Those other Golden Core cultivators couldn't possibly match Duke Dongyang's speed.


However, the downside was that Yun Youzi would be left behind. Qin Sang hoped the wooden bracelet would last long enough for Yun Youzi to catch up.


"The jade wall ahead is the entrance to the Inner Sanctum. Once inside, wait patiently where you arrive. Don't wander around, especially near ancient halls with restrictions. Chen Yan and I will find you." Duke Dongyang pointed ahead, delivering his final instructions.


Before them lay a semi-circular mountain, encircling a massive cavern hundreds of yards in diameter.  A chilling demonic energy emanated from its depths, seemingly connected to the underworld.  It was said that even Nascent Soul grandmasters had ventured into the demonic cavern, never to return, even after the closure of the Purple Subtlety Palace.


On the other side of the demonic cavern was a sheer cliff face.  Embedded in the cliff was a giant Bagua jade wall, shining like a moon in the night sky. The pristine jade wall seemed strangely out of place against the backdrop of the demonic cavern. This was the jade wall Duke Dongyang had indicated.


"The restrictions within the jade wall were once incredibly powerful, requiring even Nascent Soul cultivators to proceed with caution. Fortunately, they have been damaged, weakening their power considerably.  The remaining restrictions will only slightly affect your state of mind. With these Tranquility Pendants, you five should be able to pass through easily. Those of you with strong wills can even treat this as a trial of the heart.  It won't be particularly challenging for Golden Core cultivators, but you should still benefit from it."


Qin Sang accepted the Tranquility Pendant, feeling a coolness emanating from it that steadied his mind. He calmly put it away. With the Jade Buddha, he had no need for such an item.


"There's no time to waste. Let's go!"


With that, Duke Dongyang led them into the air, flying directly towards the jade wall. They soared over the demonic cavern. The moment they touched the jade wall's green light, Qin Sang felt a lightness. He looked up and saw the Diamond Wheel, Duke Dongyang, and the others had all vanished without a trace.


It seemed the jade wall, like the formation they encountered earlier, forcibly separated everyone.


A kaleidoscopic tunnel appeared before him, not quite real, with ever-shifting, multicolored lights. Qin Sang discreetly activated the Jade Buddha to protect his Nascent Soul. The supposed trial of the heart did not materialize.


Although the tunnel felt illusory, the ground beneath his feet was solid.  After a brief hesitation, Qin Sang propelled himself forward, rushing towards the end of the tunnel at full speed.


Inside Che Yutao's Red Dust Gourd, Qin Sang had already experienced such trials of the heart. It proved that with the Jade Buddha, these methods had no effect on him. He remained a detached observer, calm and unaffected, unable to immerse himself, and therefore unable to benefit from the tempering process. It would be a waste of time.


Qin Sang's significant advancements in mental fortitude had all come from the various encounters and tribulations he had faced along his journey.


Within the tunnel, Qin Sang utilized the Sword Qi Thunder Sound technique, transforming into a streak of sword light, speeding forward.  The tunnel was peculiar, its end seemingly endless.


Suddenly, Qin Sang felt himself touch a barrier, and in the next moment, he broke through.


"I'm out!"


Qin Sang quickly grabbed the wooden bracelet he had prepared and slipped it onto his arm.


The chaotic scene before him vanished, replaced by a bright vista. He caught a faint scent of grass, a stark contrast to the gloomy, bloody aura of the Outer Sanctum.


Qin Sang realized he was falling through the air.  Below him lay a verdant meadow dotted with yellow and white wildflowers, a picture of vibrant life.


"Please don't let me run into Duke Dongyang or Chen Yan! I heard everyone enters the Inner Sanctum at a different location. Hopefully, it won't be that coincidental." Qin Sang prayed silently as he examined his arm.


He noticed that the moment the wooden bracelet touched his skin, it had transformed into a dragon-shaped bangle.  The small, delicate yellow dragon came alive, opening its mouth towards the crimson thread on Qin Sang's arm and inhaling deeply.


The thread wriggled and was swallowed whole by the yellow dragon, yet it remained unbroken, instead binding the dragon. However, the mark's fluctuations were now blocked by the dragon.


The dragon yawned, coiled around Qin Sang's arm, and reverted back into a wooden bracelet. Qin Sang gripped it, finding it solid, and felt relieved. He began to survey his surroundings.


He stood on soft grass, facing a lush green mountain.  Spring water trickled down the slopes, and ancient trees reached towards the sky.  Yet, there were no birds or animals, not even the sound of insects. This absence gave the seemingly vibrant place an undeniable sense of stillness.


Qin Sang spotted the eaves of a building peeking through the trees midway up the mountain, indicating a hidden ancient hall. However, a layer of restrictive green light hovering above it suggested it wasn't as safe as it appeared.


Qin Sang concealed himself, slipping behind a tree.  As he shifted his gaze from the mountain to the other side of the meadow, he noticed the grass abruptly ended!


He looked further into the distance.  Clouds and mist swirled, imbued with a celestial aura, resembling a fairyland. However, amongst the sea of clouds, he could see two fragments of land floating in mid-air, each independent, like floating islands suspended in the sky.


These fragments varied in size. One resembled the one Qin Sang was on, with a complete mountain peak.  The other was much smaller, but it had a large river flowing across it.  Despite its small size, the river seemed inexhaustible, its waters cascading down from the sky, their destination unknown.


It seemed there were more fragments further away!
