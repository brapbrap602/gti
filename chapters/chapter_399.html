<h1>Chapter 392: The Might of the Magical Treasure</h1><p>A Magical Treasure!</p><p>It was actually a Magical Treasure!</p><p>Yu Hua's cultivation was at most at the Pseudo Core Formation stage, there was no doubt about that.</p><p>Yet, he could command the main souls to carry the true Ten Yama Banners. The banners unfurled with a hunting sound, black flames billowing, clearly demonstrating the activated power of the Magical Treasure.</p><p>It turned out that with the power of the Ten Yama Formation, a Foundation Establishment cultivator could use a Magical Treasure!</p><p>Without forming a Golden Core, one couldn't control a Magical Treasure.</p><p>This was common knowledge, with only a few exceptions, such as the "Divine Soul Sword Nurturing Scripture".</p><p>Qin Sang had never considered this possibility before.</p><p>Of the genuine Ten Yama Banners refined by Old Ancestor Kui Yin, only five remained.</p><p>Even within the Kui Yin Sect, these treasures were mostly controlled by Golden Core cultivators. Those who knew this secret and could utilize it were few and far between.</p><p>Liang Yan's cultivation and status were low, he wasn't privy to such secrets and clearly didn't know the details.</p><p>Sun De might have known, but when Qin Sang dealt with him, he hadn't yet mastered the "Soul Snatching Curse".</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang was weak and vulnerable, he didn't dare risk keeping Sun De alive, which would have been like sleeping with the enemy. Sun De clearly hadn't been truthful and was hiding many secrets.</p><p>The refining method for the Ten Yama Banner magical tool was passed down by Old Ancestor Kui Yin and was intricately connected to the Ten Yama Banner Magical Treasure.</p><p>Using the Ten Yama Formation to control a Magical Treasure was this formation's greatest strength!</p><p>This Ten Yama Banner Magical Treasure should be the one Zhao Yan left in the clam shell at the bottom of Yuanzhao Peak's lake, used to trap the Yuanzhao Sect's Foundation Establishment disciple guarding the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid.</p><p>Although Qin Sang coveted the treasure at the time, he didn't dare claim it. Otherwise, if he released the trapped disciple, he would certainly be killed first. He could only reluctantly leave.</p><p>It seemed Yu Hua must have returned to the lake bottom during the chaos, and the treasure fell into his hands.</p><p>This man was also not simple. Seeing the Kui Yin Sect's destruction, he clearly had the intention of seizing treasures amidst the chaos. He kept searching for Zhao Yan to steal the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid.</p><p>Even if Zhao Yan wasn't killed by Qin Sang, he would have died at Yu Hua's hands.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly rejoiced that his disguise had misled Yu Hua. Yu Hua never imagined someone could ignore the threat of the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu and never suspected him.</p><p>Otherwise, the consequences would have been dire.</p><p>…</p><p>Yu Hua's figure emerged from behind the main souls. His face was deathly pale, the pallor of severe blood loss, yet he wore a grim smile and murderous intent.</p><p>"You should be proud to have forced me to expend my vital essence and use my Magical Treasure! Hand over the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid, and I'll grant you a quick death. Otherwise, I'll throw you into the Yama Banner and let you taste the agony of a thousand ghosts devouring your soul!"</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fists, glaring coldly at Yu Hua. He had long known Yu Hua's purpose. If it weren't for the fear of losing the lead on the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid upon Qin Sang's death, Yu Hua would have already activated the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu and killed him.</p><p>As if he hadn't heard Yu Hua's threat, Qin Sang's mind raced, pondering something.</p><p>Magical Treasure...</p><p>Vital Essence...</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted, fixated on the Ten Yama Banner Magical Treasure.</p><p>The treasure emitted billowing black flames from its surface, deeper and purer than the ghostly flames conjured by Yin Soul Threads. Qin Sang felt a sense of trepidation, deeply shocked.</p><p>He didn't know what kind of flame this black flame was, but its power was undoubtedly terrifying.</p><p>The following scene confirmed Qin Sang's suspicions. Yu Hua gestured, sending a streak of black flame downwards. Like an arrow, it easily pierced through the lightning plasma and charged towards the Flying Horned Fish Dragons.</p><p>The black flame's power barely diminished.</p><p>Sensing the dangerous aura from the black flame, the Flying Horned Fish Dragons panicked, emitting terrified screeches. They even abandoned their attack on the intruders who had entered their lair and dove into the deep pool, fleeing for their lives.</p><p>The scene descended into chaos.</p><p>These ancient beasts had sharp instincts. Their reaction highlighted the terror of the black flame.</p><p>Yu Hua was extremely confident in his Magical Treasure. He didn't even glance at the scene below, seemingly certain the black flame would drive back the Flying Horned Fish Dragons. His gaze remained locked on Qin Sang.</p><p>Giving Qin Sang no respite, Yu Hua unleashed all the remaining black flames.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The Magical Treasure's surface vibrated violently. The strange black flames, deceptively slow yet incredibly fast, surged forward with a chilling aura. It was a coldness that could freeze one's Nascent Soul, like demonic flames from the depths of hell!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but shiver.</p><p>‘Sizzle…’</p><p>When the black flames collided with Qin Sang's Yin Soul Threads, a shocking scene unfolded.</p><p>The powerful Yin Soul Threads, like cotton threads encountering a raging fire, were instantly ignited and melted without any resistance.</p><p>The black flames swept through, devastating the Yin Soul Threads.</p><p>Qin Sang hastily gathered the remaining Yin Soul Threads, using all his power to conjure black fire as a shield against the onslaught of the black flames.</p><p>The black fire conjured by the Ten Yama Formation was somewhat similar to the black flames released by the Magical Treasure, likely derived from the same source. However, the difference between them was like heaven and earth.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, Qin Sang was steadily pushed back.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard the Ten Yama Formation beside him buzzing. He glanced over and saw the Yin Qi on the ghost banners fluctuating wildly, showing signs of collapsing.</p><p>If the black flames reached the formation, it would likely be destroyed!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically, his heart filled with terror. With no time to think, he quickly unleashed his Talisman Treasure.</p><p>The silver knife shone brightly. Qin Sang unleashed the remaining power of the Talisman Treasure.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The silver knife flashed, appearing before the black flames. Its light immediately dimmed. Driven by Qin Sang's desperate efforts, it unleashed a magnificent blade aura, fearlessly charging towards the black flames, burning its last embers.</p><p>The Talisman Treasure bore the brunt of the black flames.</p><p>The pressure on the Ten Yama Formation lessened momentarily, but the respite was short-lived. The silver knife Talisman Treasure's power was already depleted and was rapidly consumed by the black flames.</p><p>Qin Sang seized this opportunity, swiftly withdrawing the Ten Yama Formation and the animated corpse.</p><p>At the same time, the Flood Dragon image emerged from his dantian. Exhausting his remaining spiritual power, he activated the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and fled.</p><p>“A Talisman Treasure?”</p><p>Yu Hua frowned, surprised that Qin Sang possessed a Talisman Treasure and managed to escape the suppression of his Magical Treasure.</p><p>He felt a sense of relief, glad he had acted decisively and activated his Magical Treasure without hesitation, preventing Qin Sang from gaining the upper hand.</p><p>Otherwise, although he could activate the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu at any time to kill Qin Sang, the clue to the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid might be lost again.</p><p>“Hmm? Is this a secret talisman of the Supreme Purity Palace?”</p><p>Then, seeing the Flood Dragon essence that illuminated Qin Sang, Yu Hua recognized the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and muttered, "He killed Zhao Yan, joined the Supreme Purity Palace, and possesses so many treasures. It seems he holds a high position within the Supreme Purity Palace. My Kui Yin Sect has truly produced a remarkable talent…"</p><p>Yu Hua snorted coldly.</p><p>The black flames intensified, engulfing the silver knife Talisman Treasure.</p><p>Then, without withdrawing his Magical Treasure, Yu Hua swept up the Ten Yama Banner and gave chase.</p>
