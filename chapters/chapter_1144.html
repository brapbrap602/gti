<h1>Chapter 1136: The Willow Spirit</h1><p>Chapter 1136: The Willow Spirit</p><p>Entering the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea, the white cat visibly relaxed, leaping and darting through the bamboo groves.  The cat was intimately familiar with the area, leading Qin Sang past other creatures.</p><p>Nearing the heart of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea, the white cat led Qin Sang to a cave, saying, "Master Qin, our departure from the city was hasty, and Old Willow doesn't know we've returned. Please wait here; I'll go back and ask Old Willow how to proceed."</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>The matter was of great importance, and he understood the cat's caution.</p><p>The white cat nodded to Qin Sang, turned, and sprang from the cave, disappearing into the vast bamboo sea.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed himself at the cave entrance, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>Infiltrating the demon realm and making contact with the creatures of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea was only the first step to success. To get them to help him investigate the whereabouts of the Qieji Demon King and the mysterious stone tablet, he needed to gain their trust.</p><p>He gazed into the distance.</p><p>Since entering the bamboo sea, he had sensed the presence of various creatures, including some plant spirits.  The creatures of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea were generally peaceful; he hadn't encountered a single fight since arriving.</p><p>The sun set.</p><p>A crimson glow filled the sky.</p><p>Nightfall arrived, but still no sign of the white cat.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that bringing news of the Cloud Wanderer's demise would certainly take Old Willow by surprise, and he'd need time to consider how to treat him.  So, he wasn't worried.</p><p>He entered the cave, sat cross-legged, fed his Sky Eye Butterfly, and then quietly refined his sword array.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, it was already midnight.</p><p>The night was dark and gloomy, devoid of stars and moon, pitch black.</p><p>After sitting alone for half the night, Qin Sang’s eyelids twitched; he slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>Then, a faint whooshing sound came from outside the cave, and a white shadow flashed inside.</p><p>The white cat returned, relieved to find Qin Sang patiently waiting in the cave.  With an apologetic expression, it said, “Master Qin, I apologize for the wait.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded indifferently, glancing outside the cave; there were no other creatures in sight.</p><p>"Old Willow asked me to fetch you. He's manipulating a spirit array within his cave and has secretly diverted guards so we can avoid detection and prevent your identity from being revealed…"</p><p>explained the white cat.</p><p>Under the cover of night, they traversed several mountain ranges, disturbing no creatures, until they reached Old Willow's cave.</p><p>The beauty of the surroundings was difficult to appreciate in the darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, carefully observing his surroundings. He noticed that the white cat was leading him through mountain passes and valleys, and then the path opened into a basin.</p><p>A white mist drifted over the basin, where well-ordered wooden palaces were built.</p><p>Entering the basin, the white cat led Qin Sang towards one of the palaces.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly stopped, turning to look at a row of willow trees beside the palace. His gaze swept quickly across them before settling on an ancient willow.</p><p>"Master Qin, your skills are indeed extraordinary. You saw through my true form at a glance."</p><p>A green light suddenly emanated from the willow tree, coalescing into a somewhat translucent figure that slowly descended.</p><p>The Willow Spirit transformed into an elderly man, leaning on a cane.</p><p>His eyes shimmered with an unusual light as he sized up Qin Sang, praising him before bowing, "I apologize for not greeting you in person."</p><p>"Grandfather Willow!"</p><p>The white cat bowed respectfully.</p><p>"Daoist Willow's concealment abilities are exceptional; it was sheer luck that I sensed a trace of your presence."</p><p>Qin Sang replied humbly.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, his Sky Eye Butterfly had reached the late third stage, making it exceptionally difficult for even a Nascent Soul master, unless they possessed specialized concealment techniques, to hide from its divine abilities.</p><p>Let alone a mere tree demon.</p><p>"Master Qin, you needn't be so modest. Our King entrusted the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea to you for a reason, and I trust His Majesty's judgment."</p><p>The Willow Spirit expressed his goodwill, and seeing the sincerity in his words, Qin Sang relaxed slightly.</p><p>They entered the palace.</p><p>The Willow Spirit invited Qin Sang to sit, instructing the white cat to serve tea. His manners were no different from those of humans. Qin Sang had been worried about the volatile tempers of the creatures, but it seemed he had been overly cautious.</p><p>"The Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea's situation, as I believe Little White has already told you, has been precarious since the King's disappearance. Our realm has been vulnerable to outside forces. Just when we finally anticipated the King's return and some stability, the cultivation world's upheaval brought more bad news…"</p><p>The Willow Spirit spoke in a low tone, sadness and confusion etched on his face.</p><p>Touched by his emotions, Qin Sang felt a pang of sadness himself.</p><p>The spirit of the willow tree rallied, saying, “With the King’s passing, my cultivation is too weak to protect the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea.  But I can’t let the spirits within be slaughtered, ruining what the King left behind.  Xiao Bai mentioned that Young Master Qin possesses disguise techniques…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, revealing his plan without hesitation, simultaneously activating his Heavenly Demon Transformation and disguise techniques.</p><p>“Indeed, it’s the aura of a powerful transformed demon! Young Master Qin can impersonate the King’s heir…”</p><p>The willow tree spirit was overjoyed.</p><p>However, he seemed to remember something, his joy fading, worry clouding his eyes. He tentatively asked, “I wonder, Young Master Qin, how long do you intend to stay in the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea?”</p><p>Qin Sang understood his concern, and after some thought replied, “Currently, my most important task is refining my cultivation and preparing for the Nascent Soul stage. I have no sect, alone in the world. Before my breakthrough, where I cultivate matters little. However…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone shifted, freezing the smile on the willow tree spirit's face.</p><p>“I have another matter to request.  It will aid my advancement to the Nascent Soul stage. If I can break through, protecting the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea will be effortless.”</p><p>After speaking, Qin Sang noticed the willow tree spirit's expression, guessing he was thinking Qin Sang was using this opportunity to coerce him.  He quickly added, “Please don't misunderstand, Senior Yunyouzi is both my master and friend. Regardless of success or failure, I will give my all to his request.”</p><p>The willow tree spirit’s expression softened slightly, hesitating before saying, “If it’s related to your Nascent Soul breakthrough, it must be extremely important.  How can we help Young Master Qin?”</p><p>“I wish to ask you to inquire about something…”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, explaining his request.</p><p>“The Qieji Demon King! The mysterious stone tablet!”</p><p>The willow tree spirit stood, pacing back and forth, his brow furrowed in thought.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing he wasn’t immediately refusing, felt a flicker of hope.</p><p>After a moment, the willow tree spirit said gravely, “We plant spirits, while lacking the combat abilities of other demons, mostly possess our own life-saving techniques. However, our cultivation is low, and we cannot easily approach the Demon King’s lair and steal the tablet.  That tablet is so valued by the Qieji Demon King, that information will likely be difficult to obtain.”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was delighted, “Thank you, Willow Spirit! Knowing the Qieji Demon King’s background and the location of the lair will suffice.  Should I need to confront the Demon King directly, I have some abilities of my own and won't need assistance.”</p><p>The willow tree spirit’s eyes widened in surprise, finally giving his commitment:  “If the tablet truly aids Young Master Qin’s advancement to the Nascent Soul stage, it would be a great boon to all the demons of the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea. I will do my utmost.”</p>
