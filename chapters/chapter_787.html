<h1>Chapter 779: Sword Intent</h1><p>Within the Tower, each level contained a Teleportation Hall.</p><p>Inside the hall was a teleportation formation, allowing ascent to the next level.</p><p>The scenery on each level varied.</p><p>"Aside from the Teleportation Hall, these dilapidated buildings might harbor puppets. It would be prudent for us to share our strongest abilities to prepare for any surprise attacks," Di suggested, looking at the others.</p><p>All five were at the mid Core Formation stage, with varying strengths. Di and the old woman were the most powerful, just a step away from the late Core Formation stage.</p><p>The old woman rarely spoke, so the group naturally looked to Di for leadership.</p><p>"I possess a Bagua Mirror with decent defensive capabilities. Properly utilized, it can withstand attacks from a late-stage cultivator," the old woman said frankly.</p><p>The others looked at her with surprise. Upon seeing the extraordinary Bagua Mirror she produced, they exclaimed, "Fellow Daoist Su is too modest! An item capable of withstanding a late-stage cultivator's attack is more than just 'decent'!"</p><p>Qin Sang said, "With Fellow Daoist Su's Bagua Mirror, our safety should be assured. Although my cultivation is humble, I have some skill in swordsmanship. I've grasped Sword Qi Thunderclap and Sword Light Splitting, though I can only split one sword light."</p><p>Di clapped his hands in delight. "Unexpectedly, Fellow Daoist Qin is a sword expert! To comprehend Sword Qi Thunderclap, your swordsmanship must be extraordinary, especially in seizing fleeting opportunities. This is perfect for delivering fatal blows to the puppets. They are difficult to deal with and can regenerate. Their weaknesses are well-hidden, and opportunities are fleeting, but I believe this won't pose a problem for you."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Since Fellow Daoist Di says so, I'll do my best. However, my knowledge of puppetry is limited. I'm concerned about encountering unfamiliar puppets and missing my chance..."</p><p>The female cultivator, Yin, interjected, "Don't worry, Fellow Daoist Qin. After learning about the Tower, I studied puppetry secrets for several years. I can assist you. I also possess a secret technique to sense puppet fluctuations. Even the most stealthy puppets can be detected at close range. However, I need protection to maintain the technique."</p><p>This statement brought further excitement.</p><p>In the lower levels of the Tower, besides the ancient restrictions, the biggest obstacles were the various mechanical puppets and beasts.</p><p>No one knew how these puppets were created, but they seemed endless. Despite countless incursions into the Tower, their numbers never dwindled.</p><p>Yin's ability was a perfect counter, offering a significant advantage.</p><p>The other two then shared their abilities.</p><p>The five quickly rearranged their formation, placing Yin at the center.</p><p>The puppets on the first three levels weren't strong, comparable to Foundation Establishment cultivators. This formation served as practice for the higher levels.</p><p>Just as they formed their ranks, unsuspecting puppets attacked.</p><p>They were passing a crumbling wall when its surface shimmered slightly. Three dark figures lunged out.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Di casually struck out with his palm, sending all three puppets flying, their chests deeply dented.</p><p>The puppets resembled tigers, but their bodies were formed from what looked like green stones.</p><p>Two of the puppets shattered after being struck by Di, their internal mechanisms grinding before exploding.</p><p>The fragments scattered, then strangely eroded into dust and vanished into the darkness, leaving no trace.</p><p>The remaining puppet, still functional, lashed its tail, transforming into a streak of dark light aimed at Di's face.</p><p>Its claws, gleaming coldly, extended from the darkness, inches from his brow.</p><p>The others didn't intervene.</p><p>Unfazed, Di effortlessly blocked the tiger's claw with one hand, a thoughtful expression on his face. With his other hand, he struck the puppet, shattering it.</p><p>"Roughly equivalent to early Foundation Establishment level," Di said, turning to the others. "It's said the puppets' strength increases with each level, mirroring cultivator stages. Does this remind anyone else of a trial ground left by ancient cultivators for their descendants?"</p><p>"Not necessarily," the old woman shook her head. "Aren't there special levels within the Tower? Their landscapes are unique, and they're said to house rare treasures. The Tower holds too many secrets. Only the ancient cultivators who lived here would know its true purpose."</p><p>They continued deeper into the darkness, conversing as they went.</p><p>They encountered more puppet ambushes along the way, all similar in strength to the previous ones, easily dispatched.</p><p>After some time, they stopped, gazing at the vast space before them.</p><p>"We all know what the Teleportation Hall looks like, correct? It's somewhere in this area. Let's split up and search," Di instructed before flying off in a chosen direction.</p><p>The others dispersed, searching the darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang flew towards the right.</p><p>Spotting a ruined hall, he approached.</p><p>He was intrigued by puppetry.</p><p>From Foundation Establishment to Core Formation, he had consistently outperformed his peers. This was partly due to external forces like his refined corpses and spirit beasts, which had helped him overcome numerous powerful enemies and escape dangerous situations.</p><p>The Tower's puppets seemed capable of resurrection. If he could unravel their secrets and create powerful puppet beasts, his strength would greatly increase.</p><p>As Qin Sang neared the ruined hall, a group of tiger-shaped puppets pounced. Some spat beams of light, others attacked with their claws.</p><p>With a flick of his Ebony Sword, he effortlessly slew most of them.</p><p>He captured two of the remaining puppets and began studying them while continuing his search for the Teleportation Hall.</p><p>Ultimately, he was disappointed to discover that the puppets' regenerative abilities likely stemmed from the Tower's ancient restrictions, impossible to replicate. Even their materials couldn't be preserved after death. They would inexplicably vanish, even within his storage ring.</p><p>Searching together, the five were much more efficient.</p><p>While Qin Sang's search was fruitless, he soon received a signal and returned.</p><p>Shortly after, all five gathered before a grand hall.</p><p>The hall floated in the darkness, drifting slowly rather than being fixed in place.</p><p>It was the most intact structure on the first level, with not even a single tile missing from its roof. The ancient teleportation formation lay within.</p><p>The hall was ancient and majestic, uniquely designed with a towering, sword-like roof. It emanated a powerful Sword Intent.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang saw the hall, his mind snapped to attention!</p><p>This sensation was indescribable to others, but only those who had cultivated the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* understood the unique nature of this Sword Intent!</p>
