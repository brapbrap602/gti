<h1>Chapter 387: To understand the Way in the morning, one may die content in the evening.</h1><p>The scene of repeatedly dodging the pursuit replayed itself.</p><p>Two breaths later.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The ebony sword had just flown out from between Qin Sang's eyebrows, the sword formation barely formed, when a fist slammed into the sword's body.  Propelled by the heavy blow, the sword flew back and struck Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A sharp pain shot through Qin Sang's chest. A sweetness filled his throat as his upper body bent like a shrimp, crashing hard against the wall.</p><p>Fortunately, the ebony sword, being a magical treasure, was sufficiently sturdy and wasn't shattered by the Flying Night Devil. It shielded Qin Sang from the full force of the blow, saving his life.</p><p>Qin Sang was in a sorry state, sprawled on the ground.  As he tried to get up, his vision suddenly darkened. The Flying Night Devil, appearing as if from nowhere, closed in again.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's divine sense finally recovered enough to influence the Corpse Control Talisman.  He roared, pouring all his energy into controlling the talisman on the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil faltered slightly!</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity he had created. Lying in a bizarre, half-reclined position, he slid out of the ice hall with the utmost speed.</p><p>Fifteen breaths!</p><p>As if crossing some invisible boundary, the omnipresent sense of urgency vanished, and the Flying Night Devil disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Finally escaping the Devil's range, Qin Sang felt a sense of relief wash over him, the tightly wound tension in his mind finally easing.</p><p>“Huff… huff…”</p><p>Qin Sang gasped for air, his abdomen wracked with pain.</p><p>He gritted his teeth, clutching his dantian, and sat up halfway.</p><p>Only fifteen breaths had passed since he entered the ice hall. To keep the Flying Night Devil occupied and away from Yun Youzi, he had pushed himself to the limit, twice overdrawing his Qi sea.</p><p>The second time, he had resorted to the crudest method of refining a medicinal pill, further depleting his Qi sea and causing significant damage.</p><p>Qin Sang had been silently counting the time.</p><p>He had fulfilled his mission. Fifteen breaths, precisely as planned!</p><p>The Flying Night Devil’s whereabouts were unknown. Qin Sang stared in Yun Youzi's direction. The absence of any fighting indicated Yun Youzi's success, and he breathed a sigh of relief.  He trusted that a seasoned cultivator like Yun Youzi wouldn’t act without a plan. Fifteen breaths must have been sufficient.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang turned his gaze towards another side chamber.</p><p>With Yun Youzi's request fulfilled, it was time to attend to his own matters.</p><p>Through the soul mark, Qin Sang sensed the Living Corpse had entered the side chamber and was speeding down a narrow passage. Fortunately, the passage wasn't long and remained within Qin Sang's range of perception. He saw the end.</p><p>Suddenly, the Living Corpse froze.</p><p>The vanished Flying Night Devil was now sitting cross-legged in a hidden chamber.</p><p>One moment battling Qin Sang in the ice hall, the next back in its lair, even faster than the constantly moving Living Corpse. Its movement technique was truly uncanny.</p><p>Recalling the strange sequence of events, Qin Sang steeled his resolve and cautiously manipulated the Living Corpse towards the chamber.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil, hearing the noise, turned its head.</p><p>‘Crack… crack…’</p><p>Its gaze fell upon the Living Corpse. Its pitch-black pupils, devoid of any emotion, were chillingly cold.</p><p>Immensely tense, Qin Sang carefully controlled the Living Corpse’s movements.</p><p>One step, two steps…</p><p>As the Living Corpse drew closer, the Flying Night Devil simply watched, remaining motionless.  Eventually, it even closed its eyes.</p><p>He had gambled correctly!</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart leaped with joy.  He didn't know the reason for the Devil's change in behavior, but it was undoubtedly good news.</p><p>Fearing any unforeseen changes, Qin Sang immediately directed the Living Corpse to scan the chamber for any remains or artifacts the moment it reached the entrance.</p><p>The chamber wasn't large and was in complete disarray, filled with shattered ice.  Countless scratch marks lined the walls, possibly remnants of a past battle or the Flying Night Devil's frenzied outbursts.</p><p>The fused state of the ice shards suggested a considerable passage of time.</p><p>After a visual search from the entrance, Qin Sang was deeply disappointed. There was nothing but ice.</p><p>Unwilling to leave empty-handed, he hesitated for a moment before ordering the Living Corpse inside.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil remained motionless, perched atop the largest ice block in the center of the chamber.</p><p>The Living Corpse, its back pressed against the icy wall, carefully skirted the edges from right to left, meticulously examining every corner, lest it provoke the Devil.</p><p>The right side, nothing.</p><p>The far end, nothing.</p><p>The left…</p><p>Suddenly, the Living Corpse stopped, its gaze fixed on a spot on the icy wall in the corner.</p><p>While the surrounding area was covered in chaotic scratch marks, this inconspicuous corner bore densely packed inscriptions.</p><p>The Living Corpse, or rather Qin Sang, was overjoyed at the sight of these markings, recognizing them as potentially the only valuable thing in the chamber. He eagerly began to examine them.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body sat cross-legged outside the ice hall, recovering from his injuries with medicinal pills.</p><p>His expression shifted from bewilderment to astonishment and then to utter shock, as if the inscriptions on the ice wall contained something truly extraordinary.</p><p>Within the chamber, after reading the inscription, the Living Corpse slowly turned, its gaze complex as it looked at the Flying Night Devil sitting on the ice block.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang finally understood.</p><p>It was no wonder there were no remains of the Heavenly Corpse Sect cultivator.</p><p>Because this Flying Night Devil wasn't a corpse refined by that cultivator, it *was* the cultivator!</p><p>His name was Wu Shang, a disciple of the Heavenly Corpse Sect.</p><p>He had been at the False Core Realm during his life.</p><p>The inscription on the ice wall was Wu Shang’s record, signed with his name at the end.  The increasingly hurried handwriting suggested he was facing an imminent crisis. Qin Sang could barely decipher the final signature.</p><p>The content was divided into two parts.</p><p>The first part included the method for imprisoning cultivators and refining Living Corpses, the same information Qin Sang had obtained from the Heavenly Corpse Token.</p><p>It also contained a secret technique for upgrading a Living Corpse into a Flying Night Devil—the very technique Qin Sang desperately sought.</p><p>Refining a Flying Night Devil was extremely difficult, the technique incredibly complex.</p><p>Most of the requirements weren't overly demanding and could be met with patience and diligent searching. However, two essential items made Qin Sang cry out in dismay.</p><p>The first was a Living Corpse refined from a False Core Realm cultivator.</p><p>The second was a Golden Core or a Demon Core!</p><p>Only with both could one hope to elevate a Living Corpse into a Flying Night Devil, creating a refined corpse of Golden Core level power.</p><p>However, what truly shocked Qin Sang wasn't this secret technique, but the second part of the inscription.</p><p>The second part consisted mostly of Wu Shang's personal account, detailing how he refined himself into a Living Corpse and then elevated himself to a Flying Night Devil.</p><p>During his life, after countless attempts and failing to form a Golden Core, Wu Shang refused to accept his limitations in the path of immortality.  He recalled the Heavenly Corpse Sect’s secret technique and had a sudden, audacious idea.</p><p>If a Living Corpse could transform and ascend to become a Flying Night Devil, could he… refine himself?</p><p>He conceived it, and then he acted.</p><p>After extensive research and thorough preparation, he implanted the Corpse Control Talisman into his own soul.</p><p>He refined himself into a Living Corpse.</p><p>Then, he refined a Demon Core into his body...</p><p>Within the inscription, there was a single, profound phrase: To understand the Way in the morning, one may die content in the evening.</p>
