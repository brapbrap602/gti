<h1>Chapter 2254: Questionable Identity</h1><p>“Is Daoist Tianqi here?”</p><p>Qin Sang was cultivating when he heard a shout from outside, slowly awakening.</p><p>He was in a quiet chamber. With a thought, the walls flickered with the glow of a magical array, and the surroundings transformed.</p><p>From the outside, Qin Sang appeared to be cultivating on a tall ancient tree. The tree trunk was straight, over a hundred meters tall, smooth without branches until the crown, where all branches and leaves folded together, forming a round sphere.</p><p>Now, the branches slowly unfolded, and Qin Sang appeared on the treetop.</p><p>This is a type of spirit tree called a qingshe, naturally possessing unique properties. Planting a qingshe somewhere automatically draws surrounding spirit veins, regulating and absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy, an effect no less than some spirit arrays.</p><p>By inscribing some restrictions on the tree, one can have a natural cave dwelling.</p><p>Once qingshe trees form a forest, planted in different directions, they can be used to create a protective spirit array, making them highly prized by various races.</p><p>To set up camp somewhere, one only needs to plant a qingshe, use spirit herbs and secret techniques to cultivate it, and in a short time, one can get a superior campsite, without having to spend time on managing spirit veins, opening up cave dwellings, or arranging magical tools.</p><p>There was a qingshe forest around Qin Sang, clearly indicating he was in a demon tribe camp.</p><p>“Daoist Jiu, do you have any news?”</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the arrival and eagerly asked.</p><p>The newcomer was a powerful demon, humanoid in form but strangely appearing.  From his neck to his ears were dense scales, similar to snake scales, and his eyes were like snake eyes.  Wings pressed tightly against his back.  Unlike the wings of other demon cultivators, thin bones supported two thin membranes, covered with fine fluff.</p><p>This demon was named Jiu Yan, the leader Qin Sang had previously encountered, from the Hongyi Snake clan.</p><p>Called a snake, but not a snake clan, simply because their heads resembled snakes. The Hongyi Snake clan also has phoenix bloodline, but it is very thin.</p><p>“The camp just received a reply from the Yunhao Mountain camp, confirming Daoist Tianqi’s identity.  I never imagined Daoist Tianqi would drift so far from that river and yet emerge unscathed!” Jiu Yan exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang, disguised as a demon, claimed to be from the Yunhao Mountain camp, sent out to complete a task, with an accident occurring mid-mission where his entire squad fell into a subterranean river, drifting to this location.</p><p>Jiu Yan brought Qin Sang back to the camp for observation, and sent a message to Yunhao Mountain for verification.  His identity, mission details, and everything else matched, so Jiu Yan no longer suspected.</p><p>Because what Qin Sang said was true, except that the real Tianqi didn't fall into the river—Qin Sang killed him!</p><p>The real Tianqi was a Qingyan Bat demon, a branch of the Qingluan clan, with reportedly close blood ties.  Its wings were nearly perfect forgeries, making it easy for Qin Sang to impersonate him.</p><p>“What about my brothers? Do you have any news about them?” Qin Sang anxiously asked, full of hope.</p><p>Jiu Yan sighed, “The reply only mentions the Daoist’s situation.  The others are still missing, but since you’re alive, they likely are too. Don’t worry!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression dimmed, muttering, “It’s my fault!”</p><p>As a fellow squad leader, Jiu Yan understood Qin Sang's feelings and offered some comfort. He then asked, “What are your plans, Daoist?”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, “Does Yunhao Mountain have any orders for me?”</p><p>“No,” Jiu Yan shook his head, “They only said that the Daoist should rest and recover here.  Are you returning to Yunhao Mountain?”</p><p>Qin Sang was dejected, his voice low, “My last mission failed, causing my brothers to go missing. Even if I return, I won't have my position, and I’ll likely be punished. But I offended the clan leader's grandson years ago, leading to my expulsion. I worked hard in Yunhao Mountain for many years to build my standing; if I don't return, where can I go?”</p><p>These words held no falsehood; Qin Sang knew the real Tianqi's life story intimately.</p><p>Jiu Yan was delighted, “Daoist Tianqi, since you have nowhere to go, why not stay?”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, “I wouldn’t want to trouble you for too long…”</p><p>“If you join us, we’ll gain a powerful ally; how can that be considered a trouble?”</p><p>Jiu Yan's tone was earnest. The situation was increasingly tense, and every extra expert in the camp would be a source of strength.</p><p>Persuaded by Jiu Yan, Qin Sang followed him to meet the camp's commander, and smoothly settled in.</p><p>According to the rules, Qin Sang would start as a foot soldier, but his strength was evident, and it was only a formality. Soon, he was leading a demon soldier squad, just like Jiu Yan.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang spent most of his time in the demon camp, occasionally appearing at human outposts.</p><p>Because the high command of Xiancheng had given specific instructions, the Xiancheng generals left Qin Sang alone and did not interfere with his actions.  Qin Sang wasn't eager to climb the ranks within Xiancheng, as he was already on the radar of the high command and expected eventual promotion.</p><p>The demon side required more effort. Qin Sang aimed to quickly rise through the ranks to access more confidential information.</p><p>Originally, Qin Sang thought it would take time to secure an opportunity, but the situation escalated far faster than anticipated.</p><p>Both sides skipped the declaration of war, leveraging existing camps and fortresses.  The war began, and brutal fighting erupted at the front lines almost immediately.</p><p>Battle reports flooded in from all directions.  The fiercest battlefields became charnel houses, with both sides continually feeding new troops into the endless slaughter.</p><p>Qin Sang was indeed protected by Xiancheng.  His particular battlefield remained relatively quiet;  both sides traded blows without breaching each other's main camp.</p><p>This gave Qin Sang an opportunity to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>To gain merit among the demons, he needed to inflict damage on the other side. Qin Sang avoided directly killing his own people, instead finding other ways to achieve recognition.</p><p>As a human, he naturally favored Yongtu City, but since it was all a large-scale illusion, he would have no qualms about harming his countrymen if necessary.</p><p>The war between Yongtu City and the Phoenix Clan was divided into numerous smaller battles, forming a long front line. Both sides fought fiercely, sparing no effort to contest every inch of territory, sacrificing countless lives for a single mountain or river. This methodical, incremental advance was very different from the wars in later eras of the cultivation world.</p><p>Despite its less strategic importance, Qin Sang's location saw constant fighting.  In just over a year, countless human cultivators, descendants of deities, and demon soldiers perished, staining the earth crimson.  Even Jiu Yan, who had initially brought Qin Sang into the camp, died on the battlefield.</p><p>Through numerous battles, Qin Sang repeatedly distinguished himself, rising in rank.  Among the demons, only the Metamorphosis stage ones surpassed him in status and influence.</p><p>However, Qin Sang dared not push his cultivation of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*. Otherwise, he would eventually replace the camp commander.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang was ordered to leave the camp.  Midway, a message talisman arrived.</p><p>Frowning upon reading it, Qin Sang immediately ordered a return to camp. The demon soldiers were puzzled but dared not disobey, following Qin Sang back.</p><p>Nearing the camp, Qin Sang spotted a dark figure approaching.  He recognized the individual as someone of similar status within the camp.</p><p>"Brother Gu, why the urgent summons?" Qin Sang transmitted his question.</p><p>The demon cultivator, Gu, flew to Qin Sang and whispered, "It's the Commander's order!"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. He had just received orders to leave the camp. This was a sudden change.</p><p>Gu explained, "An hour ago, a message talisman arrived.  The Commander was alerted and personally went out to greet the messenger. Before leaving, he ordered us to assemble all troops under our command for a full-scale assault on the enemy camp, aiming for a decisive victory. The Vice-Commander and others will provide support."</p><p>"What? A surprise attack now?"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. They were unprepared; what were their chances of success?</p><p>"Who's the messenger?"</p><p>Something felt suspicious. The Commander’s personal greeting and the illogical order suggested a hidden motive.</p><p>"Unknown!" Gu shook his head.  "The Commander was extremely serious and hurried when he left. The messenger must be very important!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Gu exchanged glances, reaching the same conclusion. Only a Phoenix Clan powerhouse could warrant such seriousness and urgency for a show of strength.</p><p>"In that case, we have no choice but to obey," Qin Sang sighed. "Time is of the essence, Brother Gu. Let's each lead a division and set off immediately."</p><p>"Agreed!"</p><p>After a brief discussion, Gu and Qin Sang divided their forces and launched a two-pronged attack on the enemy camp.</p><p>The Xiancheng side was completely unaware, but scouts quickly discovered the anomaly and reported it.</p><p>Facing overwhelming妖族 forces, and unsure of their intentions, the Xian City commander immediately ordered a strategic retreat. To avoid unnecessary casualties, they abandoned outer defenses and consolidated at the main camp.</p><p>The two advancing armies met no resistance and soon surrounded the city.</p><p>The Xian City camp was established on a mountain, heavily fortified with banners and magical barriers.  Qin Sang and the Gu clan妖修, leading the assault, found themselves facing seemingly impenetrable defenses.</p><p>It was clear this camp wouldn’t fall easily, otherwise the stalemate wouldn’t have lasted this long.  They had come unprepared and were now forced into a direct assault.</p><p>They glanced back at the rear, where their deputy commander and other妖 showed no reaction. They exchanged wry smiles.</p><p>"Let's use the battle formation we practiced," someone suggested.</p><p>After a brief discussion between Qin Sang and the Gu clan妖修, orders were issued.  The formation shifted.  In an instant, the mountain was surrounded by a dense mass of妖 beasts, surging towards the summit.  Simultaneously, they scattered seeds, and countless magical trees sprouted, aiding their advance.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Gu clan妖修 had limited roles in this phase, mostly issuing commands and adjusting the formation.</p><p>Thousands of miles away…</p><p>Qin Sang’s commander stood on a mountain, gazing east, patiently waiting. His posture was ramrod straight, his expression respectful.  He remained vigilant even without sight of his target.</p><p>He waited three days. Finally, a speck of light appeared in the sky – a palanquin.</p><p>The commander rejoiced, flying forward, "My lord, I greet the two Envoys!"</p><p>"You are the commander here? Come aboard," a gentle voice called from within the palanquin.</p><p>The commander boarded. The palanquin continued its flight, passing over the camp without stopping.  The commander had briefed the Envoys on the situation, and they decided to observe the battle firsthand.</p><p>The battle raged below.</p><p>The妖 steadily advanced, relentless attacks pushing the human forces back.  The battle had escalated, with both sides’ Nascent Soul stage masters joining the fray, not in duels, but as part of their formations.</p><p>As the palanquin approached the battlefield, they witnessed the full scale assault on the mountain.</p><p>Three figures stood within, observing.</p><p>The commander shifted uneasily.</p><p>Before him were two figures. One was a young man radiating an aura of nobility, with phoenix wings sprouting from his back—a true phoenix. The other was entirely shrouded in a dark robe, his face hidden.  It was this figure who exuded the most intense pressure.</p><p>Seeing the mountain battle, the phoenix youth frowned.  "Yuan… brother?"</p><p>The robed figure turned, giving the commander a cold look. "Useless."</p><p>Before the commander could react, the robed figure leaped into the air, soaring above the mountain peak, directly over the Xian City camp.  A terrifying aura erupted.</p><p>The妖 beasts attacking the formation momentarily froze, staring upward.</p><p>"Void Refinement stage!"</p><p>Qin Sang had noticed the palanquin.  The robed figure's attack immediately identified him as a Void Refinement stage cultivator.  Why would such a powerful figure conceal his identity here?</p><p>The robed figure's next action shocked Qin Sang.</p><p>He raised a dull grey staff, which instantly dissipated into a wisp of smoke that drifted toward the formation.</p><p>With Qin Sang's current cultivation, he could only see the smoke weaving through the layers of the formation. In a flash, the outer banners shattered.</p><p>Without fanfare, before the stunned eyes of the妖, the formidable formation crumbled visibly.</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>The staff and the technique were so familiar; he had seen them used by the Yuanxiang clan leader!</p><p>*Could this be the Yuanxiang clan leader? Has he recovered his cultivation and infiltrated the妖 like me?*</p><p>Doubt gnawed at him. The aura radiating from under the robe felt malevolent, unlike the Yuanxiang leader he knew.</p><p>But who else?  Besides the Yuanxiang leader, only Yuan Ren remained from the Zhu Yan clan in the Sacred Grounds, and his fighting style differed drastically.</p><p>Wait…there's another possibility.  Someone else possessed an identical staff and mastered this technique!</p><p>Or perhaps, there were two Yuanxiang clan leaders in the Sacred Grounds!</p><p>A sudden realization struck Qin Sang.</p><p>Everyone remaining in the Sacred Grounds had encountered a grey figure during the celestial light – a being capable of perfectly mimicking their appearances, abilities, and even their magical treasures.</p><p>*Could this be one of those grey figures?  And they followed us here?*</p>
