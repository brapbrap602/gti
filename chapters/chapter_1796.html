<h1>Chapter 1787: Breaking Through</h1><p>Qin Sang was completely unaware of the exchange between Zhan Gui Zhenren and the others.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren was standing at the edge of the cliff, waiting for Qin Sang to emerge, preparing to fly back to Swordheart Island on his flying light.</p><p>“How did it go?”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren asked.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. “The Dao Court wants me to infiltrate the Ghostfang Kingdom.”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren wasn’t surprised at all.  He and Qin Sang had discussed this previously, analyzing it as the most likely outcome.</p><p>The Dao Court had countless powerful cultivators. Tasks that were easy and not particularly dangerous could be handled by the Dao Court’s Immortal Officials themselves.</p><p>Only missions like infiltrating the Ghostfang Kingdom, fraught with uncertainty, would be delegated to outsiders.</p><p>“They want me to investigate a certain secret realm, said to be near the palace of a Demon King. The details are unclear. Once I’m inside the Ghostfang Kingdom, someone will contact me…”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly recounted the contents of the decree.</p><p>There wasn't much to hide; he wouldn't know the specifics of the secret realm until he arrived in the Ghostfang Kingdom.</p><p>This also meant further variables were at play.</p><p>“Near a palace?” Zhi Jian Zhenren furrowed his brow.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. This was precisely his concern.</p><p>The so-called palace was the residence of a Ghostfang Kingdom’s prince, not comparable to a Demon King's cave in the Storm Realm.</p><p>A Ghostfang Kingdom prince, commonly referred to as a Demon King by the Dao Court, was equivalent to a Dao Court Grand Elder, a Void Refinement stage expert!</p><p>He could emanate demonic Qi and disguise himself as a demonic cultivator.  In all likelihood, he could deceive Demon Cultivators of the same rank.</p><p>But who knew if he would cause a commotion in the secret realm? Although the decree mentioned it was some distance from the palace, Qin Sang couldn't rule out the possibility of attracting the Demon King's attention.</p><p>Qin Sang had never had the opportunity to witness the divine abilities of a Void Refinement expert, and he didn't want to risk his life finding out.</p><p>Yet, this decree was considered relatively easy.</p><p>After hearing about Qin Sang’s conversation with Zhan Gui Zhenren, Zhi Jian Zhenren shook his head repeatedly. "Fellow Daoist, your luck is poor. Both decrees are difficult to fulfill and fraught with peril."</p><p>Qin Sang, however, was optimistic. "Fortunately, I invited you along, and Zhan Gui Zhenren granted me some leeway. The first decree was likely intended for a true Soul Manifestation expert. If it were forced upon me, I would have no choice but to accept."</p><p>The two exchanged a few more words, and Zhi Jian Zhenren asked him what he planned to do.</p><p>Qin Sang countered, "Do you have any leads?"</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren nodded. "Although one piece of information remains unconfirmed, it's almost certain. Fellow Daoists You Huang and Gu Yun and I are making preparations. It shouldn't take much longer. I'll explain the details to you…"</p><p>As he spoke, Zhi Jian Zhenren looked around, then cast a soundproof barrier around them, only then beginning his story.</p><p>Seeing his solemnity, Qin Sang’s curiosity was piqued, and he listened patiently.</p><p>A short while later, Zhi Jian Zhenren finished and looked at Qin Sang. “What do you think, Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, lost in thought.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren and the others were actually planning to enter the depths of the Sinful Wasteland, and still intended to confront the demonic beings of the Ghostfang Kingdom.</p><p>“Capturing or killing a Demon Marquis is enough to exchange for ascension qualifications?” Qin Sang asked in a low voice.</p><p>"Capturing alive is ideal. The Dao Court will surely reward us handsomely, and even if we divide it amongst ourselves, the Dao Court wouldn't be stingy with a single decree. If capturing alive proves impossible, slaying a Demon Marquis is also a great merit. Even if your contribution alone isn't enough, Fellow Daoist, we can share some of ours with you. If you feel indebted, you can simply return the favor later. We itinerant cultivators should help each other, and neither of the two Fellow Daoists are petty," Zhi Jian Zhenren's tone was full of confidence, as if the Demon Marquises of the Ghostfang Kingdom were easy prey.</p><p>Qin Sang also understood. The depths of the Sinful Wasteland were different from the Ghostfang Kingdom. The four of them working together, with the element of surprise, did have a decent chance of success.</p><p>According to Zhi Jian Zhenren, the Dao Court had discovered that the demonic beings of the Ghostfang Kingdom seemed to be plotting something within the Sinful Wasteland, with sightings of Demon Marquises there.</p><p>To avoid alerting them, the Dao Court hadn't mobilized a large force.</p><p>The Soul Manifestation experts of the Dao Court were often sect leaders or held important positions, making them inconvenient to move.  Itinerant cultivators from Mount Ju were the least conspicuous, hence their opportunity to intervene.</p><p>However, it was certain that the Dao Court would make other arrangements.</p><p>As long as they were patient enough and waited for the two sides to clash head-on, they would have a chance to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren smiled again. "If we're fortunate enough to uncover the demons' secrets, what's a mere decree? Perhaps we might even be able to request guidance from a Grand Elder in our cultivation."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>Guidance from a Grand Elder was a rare opportunity!</p><p>After being granted access to the Five Thunders Secret Art, he would focus on his cultivation, and Void Refinement would no longer be a distant dream.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't let this go to his head.</p><p>The Demon Marquises of the Ghostfang Kingdom were certainly aware of the danger and were likely to travel in groups. Finding a lone target would be no easy task.</p><p>That was secondary; they could remain hidden, patiently waiting for the right moment.</p><p>Qin Sang’s worry was that something that could alarm the Dao Court couldn’t be trivial. Were just a few Demon Marquises behind the Ghostfang Kingdom’s scheme, or were there Demon Kings involved?</p><p>If a Demon King appeared, Zhi Jian Zhenren’s seemingly powerful, but ultimately insufficient, sword strike would probably not deter them.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren saw through Qin Sang’s concerns and changed his tone. “Fellow Daoist, in your cultivation journey, have you ever seen a Dao Court Grand Elder in action? Have you ever heard of a Grand Elder gracing Mount Ju with their presence?”</p><p>"Never," Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>He wasn't clear on the specific reasons, but he had gleaned some information over the years. Unless they were at war with the Ghostfang Kingdom, the Grand Elders of the Dao Court rarely left the Twin Courts to manifest their power in the outside world.</p><p>"Because Grand Elders rarely leave the Dao Platforms!"</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren glanced southwest. "Cultivating to the Five Talismans rank, pursuing unity with Heaven and Earth, allows one to borrow the power of creation to nourish oneself, extending one's lifespan almost indefinitely. Every movement carries the might of Heaven and Earth. It's the same for the Demon Kings of the Ghostfang Kingdom."</p><p>Pausing, Zhi Jian Zhenren pointed towards the Sinful Wasteland to the north. "Thus, it's actually more convenient for us to operate. Fellow Daoist, imagine, if a Grand Elder enters the Sinful Wasteland, it would be like a beacon in the dark, driving all the ferocious beasts into a frenzy.  With such a commotion, we would detect them long before they approached the Demon King."</p><p>"Unity with Heaven and Earth…"</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to understand.</p><p>Nascent Soul and Divine Transformation cultivators still worried about their lifespans.</p><p>Upon reaching the Nascent Soul realm, one transcended the mundane and gained access to various methods of replenishing vital essence. Lifespan became less predictable, varying based on the cultivator's techniques, experiences, cultivation methods, and environment.</p><p>There were even differences between Body Refiners, Dharma Cultivators, and Spirit Cultivators.</p><p>Generally, it was around fifteen hundred years, with variations of a few hundred years being possible.  Divine Transformation cultivators could roughly double that.</p><p>However, the Heavenly Tribulations were even more terrifying, and most wouldn't live to die of old age.</p><p>Once one broke through to the Void Refinement realm, the only concern was the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>It was said that the Void Refinement Heavenly Tribulation was the Six-Nine Heavenly Tribulation that occurred every three thousand years, its power far exceeding that of the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation. Therefore, breaking through to Void Refinement didn't mean one could rest easy.</p><p>When Qin Sang learned that the key to breaking through to the Divine Transformation realm lay in sensing Heaven and Earth, he deduced that Void Refinement might require achieving unity with Heaven and Earth.  He hadn't expected this merging with Heaven and Earth to have such a drawback in this world.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren, able to execute a sword strike nearing the power of Void Refinement, must have received a grand inheritance.  It was not surprising that he knew these things.</p><p>Qin Sang's curiosity about the Dao Court’s Dao Platforms was aroused.</p><p>As the core of a Court, the Dao Platforms seemed to be more than just places for bestowing decrees.</p><p>This led him to realize that he had never heard of the location of Mount Ju's Dao Platform.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang asked, "How long do you plan to stay in the Sinful Wasteland, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>"It's hard to say at this point. It depends on how far the location is and the situation on the ground, but it certainly won't be too long," Zhi Jian Zhenren explained.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang nodded inwardly.</p><p>In that case, he could accompany Zhi Jian Zhenren on this trip. If they returned empty-handed, he would then fulfill the decree.</p><p>The decree didn't specify a timeframe, suggesting a flexible deadline.</p><p>He made up his mind and agreed.</p><p>…</p><p>Soon, the two returned to Swordheart Island, where You Huang Zhenren and Gu Yun Zhenren were already waiting.</p><p>Learning that Qin Sang would be joining them, the two exchanged glances. They weren't particularly overjoyed, but neither did they refuse outright.</p><p>They knew that Qin Sang was seeking ascension qualifications.</p><p>You Huang Zhenren turned to Zhi Jian Zhenren. “Fellow Daoist Qing Feng is still at the Second Rank decree level. The Protective Platform Divine General can only shield those of the Ascendant Profound rank. He’ll surely be affected far more by the Sinful Wasteland's aura than we are. Perhaps he won’t last as long. Should we return together then?”</p><p>Gu Yun Zhenren added, “Fellow Daoist Qing Feng possesses a Tranquility Pill, but only one. This journey presents complex challenges.  I fear…”</p><p>The two voiced their concerns.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren hadn’t revealed Qin Sang’s true capabilities to them before.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren chuckled. “Fellow Daoist You Huang, you needn’t worry. I happen to have a few pills that stabilize the primordial spirit. Though they cannot fully ward off the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi, they suffice as a temporary measure.”</p><p>You Huang Zhenren nodded slightly.  They wouldn’t remain in the Sinful Wasteland for long.  As long as their minds remained clear, they could recover slowly after returning.</p><p>Then, Zhi Jian Zhenren looked at Gu Yun Zhenren.  “You underestimate Fellow Daoist Qing Feng. He cultivates both Dharma and body, displaying formidable physical prowess in our last encounter. At full strength, he has the capacity to hold back two opponents. We might even have to rely on Fellow Daoist Qing Feng at critical moments.”</p><p>“Dharma and body cultivation?”</p><p>Gu Yun Zhenren’s eyes widened, looking at Qin Sang with surprise.</p><p>Dual cultivators of Dharma and body were rare in this world, even more so for those who cultivated the Dragon and Tiger Platform like him.</p><p>Qin Sang simply replied, "A stroke of luck."</p><p>He had revealed this to Zhi Jian Zhenren earlier, so there was no need to hide it from these two.  Furthermore, they were aiming for a Demon Marquis on this journey and needed to cooperate sincerely.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren stopped the eager Gu Yun Zhenren. “I know you are eager for a fight, but this is not the time for sparring. There will be plenty of opportunities for combat in the Sinful Wasteland.”</p><p>Then, Zhi Jian Zhenren turned to Qin Sang. “Fellow Daoist Qing Feng, is there anything else you need to do before we depart? Let us share our thoughts and resources, and prepare as soon as possible to avoid being caught off guard.”</p><p>The Wind Returning Armor was already refined, and Qin Sang had nothing else to do.</p><p>However, a thought occurred to him. “Fellow Daoist, do you remember the Imperial Bell Talisman? I've been gathering spiritual materials, but I'm still missing Earthly Kun Blood Sand. I haven't had any leads.”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren looked at Gu Yun Zhenren. "I recall Fellow Daoist Gu Yun having a piece of Earthly Kun Blood Sand."</p><p>Gu Yun Zhenren immediately produced the item, a fist-sized, blood-red ore.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was composed of tiny, rice-grain-sized crystals fused together.</p><p>After refining, it could be used to create the cinnabar needed for talisman crafting.</p><p>Qin Sang also took out the spiritual materials he had gathered.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren examined them. "These should be enough to refine three Imperial Bell Talismans."</p><p>Gu Yun Zhenren interjected, "I have a friend who is skilled in talisman crafting. I can ask him to create the talismans. I'll provide any missing materials. If we get more than two, how about giving me one?"</p><p>The last sentence was directed at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Agreed," Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Every cultivator in this world could create talismans, but the success rate varied greatly. Not everyone could become a master.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that if he were to create the talismans himself, he would be lucky to get one.</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>Gu Yun Zhenren laughed heartily, sweeping his sleeve to collect all the spiritual materials.</p><p>After further discussion, they dispersed.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to Pot Island, found Master Qi, retrieved the Wind Returning Armor, and informed him that he would be away for a while.</p><p>Master Qi seemed rather reluctant, whether due to a budding friendship with Qin Sang or an attachment to the Wind Returning Armor was unclear.</p><p>Qin Sang then relinquished his cave dwelling on Pot Island and cultivated in seclusion on Swordheart Island.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a year passed.</p><p>During this time, Gu Yun Zhenren visited once, informing Qin Sang that they had only managed to refine two Imperial Bell Talismans, one for each of them.</p><p>With no further news, when the four gathered, You Huang Zhenren speculated that perhaps the Dao Court had exaggerated the matter, and it would end up being a farce, their efforts wasted.</p><p>After waiting for several more months, just as Qin Sang was considering venturing into the Ghostfang Kingdom to investigate, news finally arrived!</p><p>…</p><p>Swordheart Island.</p><p>Qin Sang and Zhi Jian Zhenren stood side-by-side.  The elderly servant who addressed himself as “old slave” stood respectfully to the side. Though his cultivation wasn’t weak, he couldn't participate in battles of this level and could only remain to guard the cave dwelling.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Two streaks of escaping light arrived in tandem, swiftly approaching them.</p><p>As soon as You Huang Zhenren landed, she eagerly asked, “Is it confirmed?”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren nodded.  “Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, the source is absolutely reliable! The Ghostfang Kingdom Demon Marquises are on the move, heading in that direction. We haven't ascertained their identities yet, but time is of the essence. We can’t wait any longer.”</p><p>“How long ago did they depart?”  Gu Yun Zhenren pressed.</p><p>“Two days ago, but the news only just arrived,” Zhi Jian Zhenren said gravely.</p><p>They were all top experts in the world, and the difference in speed wouldn't be too significant. They had to hurry.</p><p>“There must be others besides us, right? Being a bit slower might not be a bad thing,” You Huang Zhenren’s expression became more relaxed.</p><p>“There are certainly others.  Who doesn't know the Dao Court’s tricks?”  Gu Yun Zhenren scoffed.</p><p>With that, everyone prepared to depart, heading north.</p><p>They arrived smoothly at the northern shore of the Star Island Immortal Lake.</p><p>Vast stretches of wild grass met their eyes. The thick, yellow stalks were as tall as two men, resembling a dense jungle.</p><p>Reaching land, the four continued to fly swiftly through the air.</p><p>The grasslands were immense. They flew for some time before reaching the edge.</p><p>By some stroke of luck, they hadn't encountered a single ferocious beast along the way.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren halted in front, his voice deep. "Ferocious beasts roam ahead. Be careful, everyone. If you encounter any, remember to end the fight swiftly!"</p><p>He handed Qin Sang several jade bottles, explaining how to use them.</p><p>The bottles contained various types of pills, clearly accumulated by Zhi Jian Zhenren over many years, all given to Qin Sang.</p>
