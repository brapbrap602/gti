<h1>Chapter 2235: Refining the Celestial Demon Form Again</h1><p>Qin Sang, Qing Yan, and the others were tense, unable to see what was happening in the pool.</p><p>After a stick of incense, the mist parted, and Qin Sang emerged.</p><p>The three held their breath.</p><p>Qing Yan’s eyes widened.</p><p>Qing Hong gasped.</p><p>Miss Shuang covered her mouth.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on a stone pillar, smiling at them, holding an eagle’s head!</p><p>…</p><p>Even after leaving the pool, the three still felt it was unreal, unbelievable.</p><p>Even with his extraordinary talent, his cultivation level was still low, yet he had managed to kill a transformed-state Golden Eagle Clan expert.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang only used a few poison pills; he mainly relied on the power of the array.</p><p>Of course, even if someone else had subdued the Stone-Embryo Fire and quickly controlled the array, killing a Golden Eagle Clan expert wouldn't be easy.  Qin Sang was an exception.</p><p>Regardless of his senior siblings’ shock, Qin Sang happily examined his spoils.</p><p>First, the Golden Eagle Clan expert's spatial storage device was invaluable, with a large capacity; Qin Sang finally wouldn't have to stuff his pockets with items.</p><p>The Golden Eagle must have held a high position within the Clan; his belongings were quite considerable, probably richer than Venerable Tong Shen, although some treasures could only be used by Golden Eagle Clan cultivators.  The collected spiritual materials and herbs alone were worth a fortune.</p><p>The Golden Eagle's corpse was also treasure, usable to refine high-grade Demonic Pills, further accelerating Qin Sang's cultivation.</p><p>Most importantly, were clues to the "Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't find the clues directly, but discovered some peculiar items. He wasn't sure if the eagle had taken them from that cave; he’d need to show them to Venerable Tong Shen.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang looked at several jade slips containing several Golden Eagle Clan cultivation techniques.</p><p>"As I suspected!"</p><p>Qin Sang examined them.  These techniques all used star energy for body refinement, similar to "Celestial Demon Refining Form."</p><p>"Celestial Demon Refining Form" was clearly more profound; even as a human, he could cultivate it, something impossible for the Golden Eagle techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't cultivated "Celestial Demon Refining Form" yet because the process required drawing upon star energy, a very noticeable characteristic.</p><p>In this era, humans and descendants of deities didn't have this method; Qin Sang didn't want to be branded a traitor to the human race.</p><p>But it was time to start.  Qin Sang now had the ability to protect himself; as his strength grew, he couldn't remain confined to Yongtu Immortal City; he also needed to visit the Golden Eagle territory.</p><p>As he pondered, they exited the array from another direction.</p><p>Looking towards the horizon, a chaotic scene unfolded; the battle was far from over.</p><p>"Let's go; Master will find us!" Qing Yan said, urging them to use talismans and leave quietly.</p><p>Away from the battlefield, they arrived at the designated meeting point to wait for their master.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang sat down, he noticed the three staring at him.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Qin Sang asked, surprised.</p><p>"You!"</p><p>Qing Hong took a deep breath, calming herself.  "Don't you want to explain how you killed that Golden Eagle?"</p><p>"What's there to explain? It got overconfident, fell for my poison, and then it was all thanks to the array…"</p><p>Qin Sang shrugged.</p><p>The three exchanged glances.  Their intuition told them it wasn't that simple, but they couldn't imagine how else Qin Sang could have done it.</p><p>Qing Hong sat in front of Qin Sang, staring at him for a while before sighing. "You're becoming increasingly amazing.  You can even kill a transformed-state expert.  Soon, your cultivation will surpass ours. Will you still acknowledge me as your senior sister?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. "Senior sister, do you think I'm ungrateful?"</p><p>"You said it yourself! Senior Brother Qing Yan will always be senior brother, and we'll always be your senior sisters!" Qing Hong put her arm around Miss Shuang, then sighed, "I wonder what kind of woman would be worthy of you."</p><p>Miss Shuang had been smiling, watching the siblings bicker.  At this, her expression dimmed; she hugged her knees, looking down at the ground silently.</p><p>Qing Hong suddenly changed her tone. "But cultivation isn't a problem!  Those romance novels say that as long as two people truly love each other, everything else is insignificant, right, junior sister?"</p><p>"I haven't read those,"</p><p>Miss Shuang mumbled.</p><p>"I haven't either. Only junior sister likes those frivolous books; aren't you afraid of Master's punishment?" Qing Yan chuckled.</p><p>"Mind your own business!" Qing Hong glared at him fiercely.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang took out the Golden Eagle's spatial storage device and emptied its contents.</p><p>“Senior brothers and sisters, this is all spoils of war. Let’s divide it up,”</p><p>The three were first shocked by the value of the treasures, then surprised by Qin Sang's generosity.</p><p>“It’s worth all the care, Junior Sister!”</p><p>Qing Hong was full of relief, yet shook his head, “No! No!  The enemy was killed by our junior brother alone; how can we take his things?”</p><p>Qing Yan and Miss Shuang agreed.</p><p>“The abilities of Master Tong Shen are mediocre, but his skill in training disciples is truly excellent. If he were in the mortal world, he would be a desirable mentor.”</p><p>Seeing their sincerity, Qin Sang sighed inwardly, but still strongly urged them to accept their share.</p><p>Finally, the three could not refuse, but they did not take anything, saying they would wait for their Master to decide.</p><p>They waited until the next morning, when Master Tong Shen finally became free.</p><p>Upon hearing about Qin Sang and the others’ ordeal, Master Tong Shen was naturally greatly surprised and exceedingly frightened.</p><p>Master Tong Shen was not as easily fooled as Qing Yan and the others.  Qin Sang recounted more details, but still attributed the greatest credit to the power of the great array and the poison pills refined by their Master.</p><p>“The poison pills I refined are not enough to kill a Golden Eagle Clan strongman. This was truly fortunate; thankfully, the outcome is beneficial to all.”</p><p>Master Tong Shen first had Qin Sang release the Stone Embryo Fire, then examined Qin Sang’s spoils of war.</p><p>“I wonder if there’s anything useful for Master,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Master Tong Shen laughed, “In the past, you always took things from Master. Now you know to show respect to your Master. Master won’t be polite. You can’t use some of these treasures yet, so Master will keep them for you.  And these few items, possibly brought from the cave, may provide clues to the ‘Great Treatise on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang.’”</p><p>Since they had decided to take the path of water and fire complementing each other, this classic text was crucial to them, and Master Tong Shen was very concerned about it.</p><p>Master Tong Shen decided how to distribute the spoils of war among the five master and disciples. Of course, Qin Sang received the lion’s share, including the demonic corpse.</p><p>“Master, after we return, can I join the Celestial Guard like my senior brothers?” Qin Sang seized the opportunity.</p><p>“Why do you want to join the Celestial Guard?” Master Tong Shen frowned.</p><p>Qin Sang replied, “Because just now, I realized I lack combat experience, leading to perilous situations. Otherwise, I could have killed that Golden Eagle much faster.”</p><p>Qing Yan and the others were speechless.  Killing a transformed Golden Eagle was still not enough?</p><p>“This… let Master think about it,” Master Tong Shen was about to refuse, but suddenly thought that the situation was becoming increasingly chaotic, and he could not always protect them. It was time to let them go out and hone their skills.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang and the others took their leave of Master Tong Shen and went ahead to return to Yongtu Immortal City.</p><p>Back in the city, Master Tong Shen continued his efforts to change the sect's path.</p><p>He spent a great deal of effort buying a fire-type cultivation technique. Although not a top-tier technique, it was compatible with the sect’s legacy.</p><p>Qing Hong would then cultivate both water and fire techniques simultaneously. Miss Shuang, who originally practiced ice-type techniques, was also willing to pursue the path of water and fire complementing each other.</p><p>Cultivating both water and fire was not easy, so they would need Qin Sang to guide them with the Stone Embryo Fire. Of course, this was for later.</p><p>As for Qing Yan, who favored thunder techniques, he wanted to find a fire-type thunder technique and would not change for the time being.</p><p>During this time, Master Tong Shen found Qin Sang a job in the city, patrolling a nearby area and not venturing too far, so the danger was minimal.</p><p>Qin Sang, only wanting to be able to leave the city at any time, readily agreed and went on duty that night, joining his colleagues.</p><p>The moonlight was like water.</p><p>The bright moonlight shone on everyone, casting clear moon shadows on the ground.</p><p>“The stars are all covered by the moonlight,” someone said.</p><p>“Good thing they're covered. Otherwise, it's like being stared at by a bunch of eyes. It's really unsettling,” a companion snorted.</p><p>This group was Qin Sang’s patrol team, on their way. They were responsible for patrolling a place where mortals lived, where there were several mortal countries. They would not interfere with mortal affairs; their main task was to prevent demonic creatures from causing trouble.</p><p>As it was human territory, the team consisted mainly of human cultivators.</p><p>“What's so scary about the stars?” someone asked in confusion.</p><p>“Don't you know? The stars are all transformed demons!”</p><p>Listening to their talk about the legend of demon stars, Qin Sang also looked up at the sky, but his mind was thinking, in the future there are no demon stars, my cultivation of the ‘Celestial Demon Transformation’ didn't feel special, but in the present there are demon stars.  Cultivating the ‘Celestial Demon Transformation’ here, won’t I be targeted by powerful demons?</p><p>Although he thought that an illusion shouldn’t be able to conjure up a great cultivator at the Unity Stage, the experiences after entering the illusion were incredibly real. Qin Sang couldn't help but have this thought.</p><p>However, in the eyes of those great cultivators, he was like an ant. Even if there were demon stars, they probably wouldn't pay attention to him.</p><p>“Daoist Qingfeng, we are almost there. Which country do you want to go to?” the leader turned to look.</p><p>Qin Sang was a newcomer. Master Tong Shen had made arrangements in advance, so everyone was very kind to him.</p><p>“I’ll go to Yue Kingdom. I am a newcomer, so please bear with me if I do anything wrong,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Yuego is the most remote of the kingdoms.  Seeing Qin Sang choose Yuego, the others’ expressions softened.</p><p>“My friend, you flatter me!”</p><p>“If Daoist Qingfeng encounters trouble, just activate the token, and I, Li Kong, will arrive immediately.”</p><p>…</p><p>After exchanging pleasantries, everyone went their separate ways. Qin Sang and another cultivator journeyed together, but parted ways near Yuego.</p><p>Upon reaching Yuego, Qin Sang showed little interest in the mortal realm. He found a secluded mountain and began setting up an array. This was an array designed to attract and gather starlight, its components already prepared.  In addition, he set up a concealment array to mask any fluctuations or unusual phenomena.  Thanks to the legacy he received from Jin Ying, Qin Sang was finally able to work freely, crafting several spirit arrays at once.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The concealment array rippled, Qin Sang stepped inside, and both he and the array’s shadows gradually faded, leaving the mountain looking untouched.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, four crystal orbs beside him. These orbs gathered and stored stellar energy, providing a constant flow for Qin Sang.</p><p>He entered a meditative state and activated the array.</p><p>Instantly, the moonlight above him seemed to dim slightly, then points of starlight emerged from the moonlight, growing brighter and brighter until individual stars became clearly visible.  The stars, as if drawn by some force, shone exclusively on this location, their light flowing over Qin Sang like water.</p><p>The four orbs simultaneously shone with starlight. Gradually, they grew brighter, attracting more starlight which entered them and was then channeled into Qin Sang's body through the array.</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Transformation*!</p><p>A profoundly familiar cultivation technique flashed through Qin Sang’s mind.  He never expected that one day he would have to cultivate it from the beginning again.</p><p>He vividly recalled Qingluan, conjuring a lifelike image of the azure bird in his mind and drawing stellar energy into his body.</p><p>The stars above seemed to shine into his very heart, countless indescribable rays of light falling upon him and merging with his being.</p><p>The starlight brought a refreshing coolness. This energy entered his flesh, coursing through his limbs and meridians.  Then, the familiar stellar煞  arrived.  Qin Sang offered no resistance, and the stellar煞 was unable to affect him in the slightest. The jade Buddha, which had kept him lucid in illusions, also blocked the illusory stellar煞.</p><p>Everything was as usual.</p><p>Qin Sang cultivated the technique, absorbing stellar energy and refining his body. He could clearly feel his physical form growing stronger.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang’s expression shifted, showing surprise.</p><p>He discovered that his cultivation speed here, practicing the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, far exceeded his expectations.  His progress being rapid at the Golden Core stage was normal, but this was exceptionally fast!</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang forcibly stopped cultivating, looking up at the stars in doubt and surprise.</p><p>Could the ancient stars be different from those of later eras?  Were the ancient stars more suitable for this cultivation technique?</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang's cultivation was too low to discern any anomaly in the starry sky.</p><p>He hesitated for a moment, then continued cultivating the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*. His cultivation base rose at an astonishing speed. He even felt that, if his body could withstand it, he could cultivate even faster!</p><p>Night passed.</p><p>The moon set, the stars thinned, and a hint of dawn appeared on the horizon.</p><p>Qin Sang finally stopped his frenzied cultivation.  He checked his progress and found that the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* had already reached the second level—equivalent to the Foundation Establishment stage!</p><p>To reach Foundation Establishment in a single night was astonishing.</p><p>Although this was good news, Qin Sang, uncertain of the reason, felt a little afraid.</p><p>“Qingluan belongs to the Phoenix clan, one of the most powerful clans in ancient times. Surely there are celestial stars transformed from powerful beings of the Qingluan clan. Could this be the reason I have received the favor of a Qingluan star?”</p><p>Qin Sang thought this, but it felt absurd.</p><p>If celestial stars had such power, all demonic cultivators would advance by leaps and bounds, and humanity would be no match for them. They would have been eradicated long ago.</p><p>“The problem must lie either with me or with the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*…”</p><p>Qin Sang re-examined the technique, which he knew by heart.</p><p>Suddenly, he remembered something. He focused his mind, visualizing Qingluan, and after carefully observing for a while, he had a faint feeling that the Qingluan he visualized was somehow different, seemingly imbued with greater vitality.</p><p>He had to remember that the Qingluan he visualized was his own Qingluan dharma image, almost perfectly realistic!</p>
