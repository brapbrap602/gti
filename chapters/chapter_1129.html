<h1>Chapter 1121: Heavenly Nectar</h1><p>"Something's not right..."</p><p>Qin Sang, unwilling to delay, activated a secret technique, urging the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to fully unleash its divine ability. Through the haze, he faintly saw that as the final bolt of heavenly tribulation descended, specks of golden light suddenly appeared in the air alongside the lightning.</p><p>These golden lights were extraordinarily peculiar, soft and fluid like water, gently rippling as they coalesced in the air. They resembled countless olives, connected by golden threads, cascading down in a continuous stream.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai let out a soft sigh, "So that's how it is!"</p><p>"Heavenly Nectar!" Qin Sang exclaimed in shock. "How could there be Heavenly Nectar here?"</p><p>Heavenly Nectar was a divine substance born from the heavens and earth when a demon beast underwent its transformation tribulation. It took the form of countless olives, connected by myriad golden threads, descending to the mortal realm. Legend had it that Heavenly Nectar was an indispensable treasure for demon beasts undergoing transformation. It could enlighten ordinary beasts, directly awakening their spiritual intelligence, making it a coveted treasure for countless demon beasts.</p><p>However, the scene above the spirit island was far less spectacular than the legends described. Heavenly Nectar only fully formed after the tribulation had passed; what they were witnessing was merely the beginning.</p><p>But Yunyouzi was clearly a human. Why would Heavenly Nectar appear for him?</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered this, he noticed that beneath the azure-gold tribulation lightning, a ball of white light slowly rose. At the center of the white light was a precious pearl.</p><p>The Flawless Pearl!</p><p>All of Yunyouzi's treasures had been destroyed by the tribulation, and the Three Radiance Jade Liquid had been completely exhausted. Only this pearl remained.</p><p>Beneath the tribulation lightning, Yunyouzi was battered and bruised, yet his eyes remained unyielding.</p><p>He would never give up until all hope was lost!</p><p>Within the Flawless Pearl, a faint bamboo shadow could be seen. The pearl hovered in front of Yunyouzi's chest, as if it and Yunyouzi were one. The pearl radiated brilliant light, facing the tribulation lightning head-on!</p><p>In the next moment, the white light suddenly dissipated.</p><p>The Flawless Pearl shattered into pieces under the tribulation lightning.</p><p>A remnant glow fell upon Yunyouzi's face, revealing a calm expression, free of resentment.</p><p>The azure-gold tribulation lightning engulfed Yunyouzi, and the remaining force of the lightning struck the solitary peak with ferocious intensity.</p><p>The Heavenly Nectar, which had been forming, suddenly vanished, leaving behind only a strange, sweet fragrance that lingered in the air.</p><p>In an instant, the clouds and mist dispersed.</p><p>The tribulation clouds, having unleashed their final bolt of lightning, dissipated into thin air. The overwhelming dark clouds also scattered with the wind, allowing strands of sunlight to pierce through, bringing light back to the world.</p><p>The storm subsided, and the waters quickly returned to calm, as if nothing had ever happened.</p><p>The celestial phenomena vanished, and everything returned to normal.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had been anxiously waiting, immediately summoned his escape light and rushed toward the spirit island.</p><p>The white crane was recalled into the Primordial Unity Ring, and Bai retreated into the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang seemed to sense something. His gaze sharpened as he glared at the waters below, shouting, "You dare!"</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Three-colored escape lights erupted from his body.</p><p>His cultivation had reached new heights, and his escape technique had improved significantly. Qin Sang transformed into a streak of light, swift as lightning, appearing on the other side of the water in a few flashes. The Ebony Wood Sword inverted, and a burst of sword light shot forth, plunging into the depths of the water!</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Water sprayed into the air.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword returned to Qin Sang's hand, and without a second glance, he turned and rushed toward the spirit island.</p><p>Not long after Qin Sang left, streams of blood began to rise from the water.</p><p>Moments later, chunks of flesh floated to the surface, staining a large area of the water red.</p><p>The stench of blood filled the air, nauseating to the senses.</p><p>It was a ghost fish that had recently broken through to the demon core stage. Trembling in fear beneath the heavenly tribulation, it had been unable to resist the allure of the Heavenly Nectar's aura and had ventured out to investigate, only to lose its life.</p><p>Qin Sang showed no mercy. Without even seeing what his opponent was, he unleashed his sword wheel, shredding the ghost fish into pieces.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The two of them returned to the island one after the other.</p><p>The spirit island was in complete disarray.</p><p>The solitary peak was riddled with holes, its summit sheared off, leaving a massive crater.</p><p>Qin Sang was the first to reach the peak. His eyes filled with anxiety as he quickly scanned the area. To his delight, he spotted a figure within the craterâ€”it was Yunyouzi.</p><p>Yunyouzi sat cross-legged on the ground, severely injured and his aura extremely weak, but he was still alive!</p><p>"Senior, have you already overcome the heavenly tribulation?" Qin Sang asked with joy and concern.</p><p>After the lightning tribulation, the heart demon tribulation should have followed immediately.</p><p>Yunyouzi's expression and gaze did not seem to be those of someone ensnared by a heart demon.</p><p>It was said that when the heart demon tribulation struck, the person undergoing the tribulation might feel as though decades or even centuries had passed, though in reality, it was only an instant.</p><p>Given Yunyouzi's mental fortitude, overcoming the heart demon tribulation should not have been difficult.</p><p>This meant that Yunyouzi had likely already overcome the heavenly tribulation and successfully formed his nascent soul!</p><p>"Great Ancestor!" Li Yufu exclaimed with overwhelming joy.</p><p>He had thought that his great ancestor had failed the tribulation. Seeing Yunyouzi alive, his emotions soared from despair to elation.</p><p>As they approached, Yunyouzi's eyes flickered, and with a slight movement of his finger, a golden pearl fell into his mouth, which he swallowed.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the golden pearl resembled the color of the Heavenly Nectar.</p><p>He glanced around but saw no trace of the Heavenly Nectar. Had it all been an illusion?</p><p>After swallowing the golden pearl, Yunyouzi's aura stabilized somewhat. He stood up and said softly, "Let's leave this place first."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>The commotion caused by Yunyouzi's tribulation was too great and might attract the attention of powerful demons and cultivators in the distance.</p><p>It was best to leave this place of trouble as soon as possible.</p><p>Yunyouzi took the lead, flying northward from the spirit island.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely, protecting Yunyouzi.</p><p>He could sense that even after consuming the Heavenly Nectar, Yunyouzi was still very weak.</p><p>For some reason, Qin Sang felt that there was something strange about Yunyouzi now, though he couldn't quite put his finger on it.</p><p>Yunyouzi remained silent.</p><p>Qin Sang had no choice but to suppress his doubts.</p><p>"Brother, do you still have the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid with you? This old man has yet to fulfill his promise to refine the Calamity Dispelling Pill for you," Yunyouzi suddenly asked.</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. "Senior, there's no rush to refine the pill. Once your injuries have healed, we can refine the Calamity Dispelling Pill then."</p><p>An ominous feeling grew stronger in his heart.</p><p>Li Yufu also sensed something amiss, his joyful expression freezing.</p><p>"Alas, this old man used the Heavenly Nectar to barely cling to life. I'm afraid I won't last until then..." Yunyouzi sighed.</p><p>Before he could finish, Yunyouzi suddenly changed direction, landing on a desolate island.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, Yunyouzi had also established a cave dwelling on this island.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly followed, exclaiming in shock, "Senior, you..."</p><p>"This old man doesn't have much time left. I'll explain everything to you later, cough..." Yunyouzi's aura fluctuated as he took the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid and other supplementary spirit herbs without further ado. He then turned to Li Yufu and said, "Yufu, refining the Calamity Dispelling Pill requires exceptional skill, no less than that needed for nascent soul-level pills. This will be of great benefit to you. Your current mastery isn't sufficient, so remember the refining process carefully... Follow me."</p><p>Li Yufu's eyes reddened as he glanced at Qin Sang, then silently followed Yunyouzi into the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang stood dumbfounded outside the cave.</p><p>He had already sensed what was coming but refused to believe it.</p><p>Qin Sang waited outside the cave for a long time, but there was no movement from within. His heart was in turmoil as he paced back and forth in front of the cave entrance.</p>
