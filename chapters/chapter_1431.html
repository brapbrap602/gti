<h1>Chapter 1423: The Grand Cultivator's Last Resort</h1><p>Given Hunmo Laoren's understanding of the Jinghai Sect,  Yu Yi Yuanjun wouldn't believe him if he couldn't clearly explain what treasures the sect possessed.</p><p>Hunmo Laoren's eyes flickered.</p><p>Meeting Hunmo Laoren's gaze, Yu Yi Yuanjun's heart tightened, but her smile remained.</p><p>Hunmo Laoren chuckled, saying with a smile that wasn't quite a smile, "I can't hide it from the Immortal's discerning eyes. I only seek one thing – a sea chart. If you find it, Immortal, I hope you'll share it."</p><p>"A sea chart?"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun was quite surprised, misunderstanding Hunmo Laoren's intentions. "With your strength, Senior, you wouldn't need a sea chart to cross the storm belt to Beichen. I heard you once clashed with a mysterious expert from Beichen, is that true?"</p><p>"Indeed. This person possessed several avatars, his skills were extraordinary. I didn't gain much advantage. I made a deal with him – not to enter Beichen for three hundred years."</p><p>Hunmo Laoren readily admitted this, then his tone shifted. "I don't intend to break my promise. That sea chart points to another place."</p><p>"Another place?"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun was puzzled at first, then her beautiful eyes widened suddenly. "Central State!  The legendary Central State actually exists? The Jinghai Sect has a sea chart leading to it?!"</p><p>Hunmo Laoren neither confirmed nor denied this, asking instead, "Does the Immortal also know of Central State?"</p><p>"I thought it was just a legend, but it's real. There's actually a path from the North Sea to Central State…"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun let out a breath, calming her thoughts. "This path only exists in legends, no one knows if it's real. Why are you so sure the Jinghai Sect possesses this sea chart?"</p><p>Hunmo Laoren tapped the ground with his black bamboo staff, pointing towards the Jinghai Sect below. "Don't you find it strange?  The Northern Sea's Daoist and Demon sects are thriving, while Buddhist sects are insignificant, their lineages broken, with few Nascent Soul cultivators.  Why did such a powerful, unknown Buddhist sect suddenly appear?"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun understood the implication, looking bewildered. "You mean the Jinghai Sect is from Central State? That's impossible!"</p><p>"It's just a guess," Hunmo Laoren laughed, unwilling to elaborate on the subject. His tone changed. "Immortal, if you're interested, once I obtain the sea chart, we can share it.  Once you reach the late Nascent Soul stage, perhaps we could travel together to Central State, looking out for each other."</p><p>"Late Nascent Soul stage, heh!"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun shook her head with a wry smile, thanked him, and asked thoughtfully, "Can one safely cross the storm belt and reach Central State at the late Nascent Soul stage?"</p><p>"We'll have to wait and see after obtaining the sea chart. However, if I'm lucky enough to break through to the Divine Transformation stage, I probably won't need a sea chart," Hunmo Laoren stroked his bamboo staff uncertainly.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the Buddhist pagoda.</p><p>Three figures landed on the ground.</p><p>The thirteen-story pagoda stood tall, each floor being twice the height of a man.</p><p>The pagoda was made of stone, its doors and windows tightly shut.  Unknown arhats and Buddhas were carved on it, lifelike, as if gazing at the intruders.</p><p>A layer of golden light covered the entire pagoda – a unique Buddhist restriction.</p><p>This area was rather dim; the restriction's power was inferior to the golden top.</p><p>The pagoda had already been visited by the Ghost Mother.</p><p>However, to prolong the seal, the Ghost Mother acted cautiously, not completely destroying the pagoda's restrictions; no artificial traces were visible.</p><p>They looked up for a while. The Buddhist restriction was unfamiliar to them, leaving them with no choice but to attack forcefully.</p><p>Unable to see inside the pagoda, they didn't know it had already been ransacked.  To them, the restrictions were damaged by the Red Flame's impact on the seal.</p><p>No one noticed that the expression of Chijie Zhenren was somewhat off.</p><p>He wasn't as excited as before, staring at the base of the Sutra Pavilion beside the thirteen-story pagoda, his eyes filled with despair.</p><p>"Let's do it!"</p><p>Chijie Zhenren sighed, summoning his needle-shaped artifact specialized in breaking restrictions.</p><p>The other two weren't far behind.</p><p>As Chijie Zhenren raised his artifact to act, he felt a sudden inexplicable unease, followed by a chill on his left shoulder, startling him.</p><p>"Don't move!"</p><p>A cold warning echoed in his ears.</p><p>Hunmo Laoren!</p><p>Chijie Zhenren's body stiffened, his heart churning.</p><p>He immediately remembered what was on his shoulder. Earlier, when ambushing Mu Valley Master, he had witnessed it firsthand – a ghost-like being, extremely strange.</p><p>If Mu Valley Master hadn't used a peculiar protective treasure, he wouldn't have escaped, and all three would have died at the hands of Hunmo Laoren.</p><p>Even before becoming a Grand Cultivator, Hunmo Laoren was already infamous. His enemies often died mysteriously, with no cause found, likely due to this ghost's ability.</p><p>Chijie Zhenren wasn't even sure when it happened.</p><p>羽衣元君 and his companions were nearby, yet they noticed nothing unusual!</p><p>"No! Impossible! Not in front of so many people!  It must have been when the attack on Mu Valley Master happened. That old demon took advantage of the chaos to plant the ghost spirit on me. He never truly trusted me..."</p><p>Master Zhijie's mind raced, a possibility forming.</p><p>"I know what you're looking for," the old demon's voice remained cold and calm, regardless of Master Zhijie's thoughts. "You shouldn't have hidden it from me... I owe your master a favor.  With the Zhenling incense, we can call it even."</p><p>Hearing the words "Zhenling incense,"</p><p>Master Zhijie's last shred of hope vanished. He felt like half his body was freezing, struggling to maintain a composed expression. He stammered, "It was my momentary lapse in judgment, a devilish obsession. Please forgive me, senior. But... the Scripture Pavilion is destroyed. Master said the Zhenling incense wasn't in the pagoda, but stored with its refining method, both kept in the Scripture Pavilion. I'm afraid..."</p><p>He dared not withhold anything further, revealing everything he knew.</p><p>The old demon didn't seem surprised, sighing slightly. "So it was in the Scripture Pavilion... No wonder you were so despondent earlier. Go, open the pagoda and see what's inside."</p><p>Yuan Ying cultivators can control their emotions.</p><p>However, some may not choose to, as it's unnecessary.</p><p>Furthermore,  waves of emotion are inevitable during moments of joy or sorrow. They are human, after all, not inanimate objects.</p><p>Master Zhijie had gone to great lengths, believing he was on the verge of success, only to find the Scripture Pavilion reduced to nothing. His feelings are understandable.</p><p>Even the emotional fluctuations could be perceived by the attached ghost spirit.</p><p>Master Zhijie's mind was taut, his fear of the old demon's abilities growing.</p><p>Moments later, Master Zhijie cautiously approached the pagoda, summoned his needle-like magical artifact, and numbly attacked the Buddhist restriction.</p><p>The two people beside him didn't notice his unusual behavior.</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>In the medicinal garden.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tan Hao were busy harvesting the most valuable herbs.</p><p>Guided by the Ghost Mother, and having spent considerable time at Jing Hai Sect, Tan Hao had a deep understanding of its restrictions.</p><p>Under Tan Hao's guidance, Qin Sang personally broke the restrictions. The phenomenon was subtle, avoiding detection by outsiders.</p>
