<h1>Chapter 1914: The Path of Divinity</h1><p>“Thank you, Immortal, for saving our lives.”</p><p>Beside a willow tree, a faint, translucent figure materialized, resembling a scholar. This was the very person Village Head Yue Kaishan had seen in his dream.</p><p>The scholar bowed deeply to Qin Sang, his words earnest.</p><p>Qin Sang replied, “First, I must thank you on behalf of these villagers for your protection. Moreover, that Locust Spirit did not resort to killing.”</p><p>The so-called Locust God wasn't a single locust that had attained sentience. Qin Sang surmised it was a Locust Spirit born from the collective will of the swarm, through some fortuitous encounter.</p><p>The donkey-riding woman, as well as the willow tree spirit before him, were manifestations of divine will, not truly transformed beings.</p><p>It reminded Qin Sang of the mysterious spirit worm he had traded with Fei Can in the Storm Realm, when he first entered Zhongzhou.</p><p>The scholar said, “Locusts seek food; it's their nature. She didn't intentionally target the human race.”</p><p>“You're kind to speak on her behalf,” Qin Sang said, shaking his head. His gaze shifted to a small Earth God shrine in the village.</p><p>The stone shrine was crudely built, lacking a dedicated attendant.  The villagers, unable to afford gold paint and elaborate decorations, offered their reverence to a simple clay statue.</p><p>In the mortal world, the image of the Earth God was largely the same.</p><p>This Earth God statue was also a long-bearded elder with a benevolent countenance, bearing no resemblance to the scholar before him.</p><p>“Where is the Earth God of this place? Why are you, an unrelated willow demon, here to avert disaster?”</p><p>Residual fluctuations lingered on the clay statue, indicating a previous Earth God's presence.</p><p>The scholar’s expression darkened. “Three years ago, a tiger demon wreaked havoc in the mountains.  The Earth God, protecting the villagers, was killed by the tiger demon. Ever since I gained sentience, the Earth God often channeled spiritual energy to nourish me, allowing me to reach this state. Having received his grace, I dare not forget his kindness.”</p><p>“I see.” Qin Sang had already noticed the cracks on the clay statue, its two arms broken and reattached with white plaster.</p><p>“You have the heart to inherit the Earth God's will, the desire to protect the people, and such benevolent deeds. Do you wish to inherit the divine position? If you do, I will have the villagers sculpt a new clay statue. Then, you can receive incense offerings, stepping onto the Path of Divinity.”</p><p>Hearing this, the scholar became agitated. “I can? But…”</p><p>His reaction clearly showed his willingness, yet a worried expression ultimately clouded his face.</p><p>“What are your concerns?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“I’ve heard that, aside from mountain gods and earth deities born naturally in remote mountains and forests, all deities in the human world must receive an official decree. Without a decree, without being enshrined in the official register, one isn't a true deity but a heretical idol.  Such shrines are destroyed, and the mountains razed, by the City God's forces. Moreover, those who receive decrees are all virtuous humans. My origins… I fear…” The scholar’s face was filled with worry.</p><p>“The Beikuo County City God hasn’t dispatched a new Earth God in three years.  It is his negligence to leave this place unattended. You drove away the Locust Spirit, protecting this area, effectively compensating for his oversight.  If he clings to prejudice against other races, he is unworthy of the position of City God,” Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>“Immortal, please be careful!” The willow demon was terrified, frightened by such audacious words.</p><p>However, recalling how Qin Sang effortlessly restored his vital energy, the willow demon realized that this person was extraordinary.  To speak such words, he must have confidence.</p><p>Hesitantly, the scholar bowed again. “Then I’ll trouble the Immortal to speak kindly on my behalf to the City God, to request a decree. If… if… the City God refuses, please don’t force the issue…”</p><p>The Locust Spirit had flown far away. The villagers remained kneeling, prostrating repeatedly, unaware of the conversation between Qin Sang and the scholar.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward and cleared his throat.</p><p>Yue Kaishan was lying prostrate, muttering something.  He looked up, saw Qin Sang, and was about to kowtow again.</p><p>“Thank you, Immortal…”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped him. “Come, let us speak.”</p><p>Moving away from the crowd, they walked beneath a willow tree.  Qin Sang pointed at the tree and explained the truth to Yue Kaishan.</p><p>“…You should sculpt a new statue in the shrine, according to the image of the scholar in your dream, and offer incense.”</p><p>Yue Kaishan returned to the villagers, shouting excitedly, “The Willow God protected us! The Willow God protected us!”</p><p>…</p><p>On the small path.</p><p>Qin Sang led his horse back. Under a willow tree by the roadside, the scholar’s translucent figure bowed to them from afar.</p><p>On this journey, Qin Sang hadn't made a move, nor had he witnessed any intense battles. Zhuque dozed, and Xiao Wu showed nothing unusual.</p><p>Qin Sang walked slowly, constantly pondering Xiao Wu’s question.</p><p>Seeing Xiao Wu spear fish, Qin Sang had a premonition. This trip confirmed his thoughts.</p><p>Whether influenced by the slaughter in the desert, or by nature, Xiao Wu seemed more suited to the Path of Slaughter than he was.</p><p>“Could the key to tempering demonic intent lie here?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t answer Xiao Wu’s question.</p><p>He could easily give a dozen answers, but with Xiao Wu, he had to be extremely cautious.</p><p>“We can choose to kill, or we can choose to save. In our future travels, we won’t kill, only save!”  Qin Sang made a decision.</p><p>It sounded like, doing this, he wouldn't be able to comprehend the Path of Slaughter.</p><p>However, based on Qin Sang’s understanding of the *Ziwei Sword Canon*, the Ziwei Emperor likely experienced a period of sheathing his sword, attempting to suppress his killing intent until he found his own Dao.</p><p>Qin Sang had never considered sheathing his sword.</p><p>The Great Dao of the world had yin and yang; yang gives birth to yin, and yin gives birth to yang.  Everything was like this. Perhaps he could glean some insights from it.</p><p>Since this was a journey of experience, comprehending various states of mind was also part of it.</p><p>Qin Sang once again appreciated the benefits of the Void Refinement stage: a long lifespan, heavenly tribulation only once every three thousand years, and more time to comprehend and seek the Dao.</p><p>Xiao Wu always obeyed Qin Sang without hesitation.  He nodded lightly.</p><p>“How boring!” Zhuque grumbled.  “How can we punish evildoers without killing? How can we uphold justice for Heaven?”</p><p>“Some have strayed from the right path, some have made momentary mistakes. All can be saved.  As for those irredeemable villains, doesn't the City God Temple have a Department of Punishment?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, mounted his horse, flicked the reins, and like a mortal Daoist priest, galloped away.</p><p>Luo Hou’s speed was only slightly faster than a mortal horse, but nothing could stop her as she raced along the riverbank.</p><p>Qin Sang drew a portrait of the Willow God for the villagers and was persuaded to stay for a feast. By the time he left, it was near dusk.</p><p>Before reaching Beikuo County City, the sky had already darkened, and a crescent moon hung high.</p><p>Moonlight scattered on the river's surface, tree shadows reaching out like water ghosts.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>A sudden wind arose on the river, a gust of chilly air blowing towards him, adding a touch of eeriness to the night.</p><p>From where the wind came, a faint mist spread across the riverbank. Within the mist, two figures flickered, their feet not touching the ground.</p><p>However, their attire—neat black robes, tall hats, swords at their waists, stern faces, and a faint, peculiar spiritual light—indicated they were not wandering ghosts.</p><p>On the back of their robes, a single character was written: ‘North.’</p><p>They travelled swiftly, riding the wind. Hearing the rapid hoofbeats ahead, they flew higher and looked ahead, seeing a Daoist riding at night.</p><p>Though peculiar, they didn’t find anything particularly remarkable about the Daoist.</p><p>They didn’t reveal themselves, continuing forward.  Just as they were about to pass each other, the Daoist suddenly stopped, his eyes clearly fixed on them.</p><p>“He can see us?”</p><p>The two instinctively gripped their sword hilts.</p><p>Qin Sang dismounted and bowed slightly.  “Are you two the Yin Messengers of Beikuo County? My Daoist name is Qingfeng.”</p><p>“Indeed! Greetings, Daoist Qingfeng.” The two Yin Messengers guessed Qin Sang was a cultivator, with cultivation far surpassing theirs.  They returned the greeting in unison.</p><p>“Judging by your direction, you are here to investigate the locust plague? Why so late?”</p><p>With villagers from West Fifth Village seeking work in the city, a competent City God should have immediately caught wind of the situation.</p><p>Sending Yin Messengers only after four days, if not for the Willow God blocking the swarm, who knows how many crops would have been devoured.</p><p>Reprimanded to their faces, the Yin Messengers suppressed their anger. “There were other urgent matters in the city. The various officials were occupied and only learned of the locust plague rumors today, immediately dispatching us to investigate. If it’s an ordinary locust plague, it’s a matter of the Heavenly Dao and requires no intervention. If there's demonic interference, we must eliminate it!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  “Indeed, there was a demonic locust causing trouble, but it has been driven into the deep mountains without harming the people.”</p><p>The two Yin Messengers exchanged glances, their expressions softening. They bowed, “Thank you, Daoist, for driving away the demonic evil, saving us the trouble.”</p><p>“Not at all, it wasn’t me.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and explained the situation, including the willow demon's request for a decree.</p><p>“This…” The Yin Messengers hesitated. “Such matters of decree are beyond our authority. We ask that you accompany us to the city to consult with our superiors.”</p><p>Qin Sang had no objections and gestured for the Yin Messengers to lead the way.</p><p>One Yin Messenger whispered to the other, transformed into a gust of wind, and headed to the city to report. The remaining Yin Messenger led Qin Sang at a leisurely pace.</p><p>Their speed wasn't slow, and soon, a large shadow appeared in the distance, the outline of the city.</p><p>Not long after nightfall, the city was brightly lit.</p><p>One city gate was next to the docks. Houses lined both sides of the great river, bustling with activity, forming a small town.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a familiar boat. Chen Ya'er was at the bow, cooking over a fire. The rattle drum he had given her was still in Xiao Wu’s hands.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang noticed a figure in embroidered official robes standing at the city gate, his aura imposing, with a row of Yin Messengers lined up behind him.</p><p>Before curfew, the city gate was crowded with people coming and going, yet no one seemed to see him.</p><p>“It's the City God!”</p><p>The Yin Messenger exclaimed softly, surprised that the City God would personally come out to greet them.</p><p>The azure horse leaped, crossed the river, and landed steadily before the city gate.</p><p>The City God was a middle-aged man with a square face, thick eyebrows, and large eyes. His face radiated righteousness. From afar, he had been quietly observing Qin Sang, already informed of his Daoist name by the Yin Messenger.</p><p>“Beikuo County City God, Gao Ruoxu, greets Daoist Qingfeng.”</p><p>Qin Sang led Xiao Wu off his horse and bowed slightly. “I am Qingfeng. I shouldn’t have troubled the City God to personally greet me.”</p><p>Gao Ruoxu laughed heartily and said to his attendants, “Present it.”</p><p>Immediately, Yin Messengers presented a scroll of golden silk with both hands.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu took it and slowly unfurled it before Qin Sang. It was a decree appointing the willow demon as the Earth God.</p><p>“The willow demon repelled the demonic evil and protected the people. Although of a different race, its heart is commendable. As the City God of Beikuo County, I have the authority to appoint Earth Gods, reporting to the prefecture city afterward. Daoist, please review it for any omissions.”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t expected the City God to be so straightforward. “On behalf of the willow demon, I thank the City God.”</p><p>Gao Ruoxu nodded and handed the golden silk to two Yin Messengers.</p><p>“Quickly, to the West Fifth Village Earth God Shrine!”</p><p>The Yin Messengers took the decree and departed. Qin Sang and Gao Ruoxu conversed as they walked into the city.</p><p>Chen Ya’er’s boat wasn't far away. She was blowing on the stove, then seemed to hear the sound of a rattle drum and quickly looked up.</p><p>The night was dim; the expected figure wasn’t there. Disappointment filled her face.</p><p>Within Beikuo County City, the City God Temple was even more magnificent than the county government office.  The marketplace in front of the temple was the liveliest place in the city.</p><p>Qin Sang led Xiao Wu, walking side-by-side with Gao Ruoxu through the marketplace.</p><p>Luo Hou and the Yin Messengers discreetly followed behind.</p><p>Even now, the City God’s civil and military judges, along with the various department officials, were nowhere to be seen. The dignified City God was accompanied only by a few Yin Messengers, and the City God Temple had no other divine presence.</p><p>Coupled with Gao Ruoxu’s unexpected enthusiasm, Qin Sang knew something was amiss but pretended ignorance, engaging in idle chatter with him.</p><p>When asked about his Immortal sect, Qin Sang simply claimed to be a solitary cultivator, traveling the world.</p><p>As they spoke, two Yin Messengers suddenly left the group and disappeared into a dark alley.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped and turned to look.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu also stopped. “Old Mr. Sun of the Jisheng Pharmacy is nearing the end of his lifespan.”</p><p>“Are the two Yin Messengers going to escort Old Mr. Sun on his final journey?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Based on his experiences in the Storm Realm, when mortals reached the end of their lives, unless their souls were forcibly taken, or other variables occurred, their souls would simply dissipate. There was no concept of reincarnation.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu nodded.  “Old Mr. Sun is a benevolent physician, providing relief to the poor and suffering. He has saved countless lives throughout his life, earning the title of ‘benevolent physician’ and the love and respect of the people. He may be suitable for induction into the Path of Divinity.”</p><p>“Induction into the Path of Divinity?” Qin Sang’s gaze swept over the Yin Messengers. “Were you, my lord, and these Yin Messengers, all righteous individuals in your previous lives, becoming deities after death?”</p><p>“To my shame, in my previous life, I only accomplished insignificant deeds.”</p><p>Gao Ruoxu perceived Qin Sang’s unfamiliarity with the Path of Divinity and explained, “Humans have three souls. After death, the Heavenly Soul returns to Heaven, the Earthly Soul returns to Earth, and the Human Soul drifts, its destination unknown.  Legends speak of reincarnation, but its truth is uncertain.  However, some, for various reasons, retain their souls after death.</p><p>“If entangled by hatred or obsession, these souls linger, sometimes becoming malevolent ghosts causing chaos. These need to be suppressed or eradicated.”</p><p>“If one performs good deeds in life, earning the praise of thousands, their soul retains a spiritual light after death and doesn't immediately dissipate, possessing the potential for divinity. Perhaps this is the Heavenly Dao’s acknowledgment of virtuous acts.</p><p>“Our duty as City Gods is to guide these individuals onto the Path of Divinity, so that when our Yin lifespan ends, there are still deities to protect this land.”</p><p>Qin Sang, with his high cultivation and travels, had never had the time to understand these matters thoroughly.</p><p>According to Gao Ruoxu, the true Path of Divinity differed from worldly legends.  There were no Ox-Head and Horse-Face guardians, no King Yama, no eighteen levels of hell for the wicked…</p><p>Even reincarnation was merely a legend to the City God.</p><p>The Path of Divinity in the Grand Firmament also differed from the Path of Divinity in the Dao Court, requiring no merging with a talisman to enter.</p><p>He wondered which came first.</p><p>The Dao Court's Path of Divinity was clearly more complex and restrictive. Could the Dao Court be the origin of the Path of Divinity, which continued to evolve in the Grand Firmament after the Dao Court's decline?</p><p>Otherwise, with incense offerings being the same, why hadn’t the Path of Divinity spontaneously developed in the Storm Realm?  Or was there another reason?</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze was distant.</p><p>This was another peculiarity of the Storm Realm!</p><p>Two figures appeared before his eyes.</p><p>Even after a thousand years, their faces and voices remained clear.</p><p>Daoist Jixin, Mingyue.</p><p>They traveled and practiced medicine, healing countless people. The people had even erected shrines for them.</p><p>If they had been born in the Grand Firmament, they too would have been guided onto the Path of Divinity.</p><p>可惜…  What a pity…</p>
