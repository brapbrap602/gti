<h1>Chapter 282: Embarking on a Journey</h1><p>Ge Yuan said with a laugh, "Senior is too kind. Even if we do not find the medicine field, I know of several places in the Qiuhong Marketplace where there are treasures hidden. We can work together to explore those spots, which will surely yield some results. Senior will not return empty-handed."</p><p>Yunyouzi merely nodded with a smile, and his response was a perfunctory echo of Ge Yuan's words.</p><p>Qin Sang understood in his heart that Yunyouzi, just like him, cared only about the healing spirit medicines. If they could not find those medicines, this trip would truly be a waste of their time.</p><p>The three of them each dripped their blood essence onto the Unity Plaque, and the blood melded together.</p><p>After the Unity Plaque absorbed their blood essence, a connection was established between them.</p><p>Each of them took a Unity Plaque and discussed their plans slightly before parting ways and going their separate ways.</p><p>Unless it was absolutely necessary, they would not contact each other again before entering the Qiuhong Marketplace.</p><p>...</p><p>In the small courtyard.</p><p>Everyone stood in one spot, listening to Yu Kong explain the Return to Origin Formation in detail.</p><p>The principles behind the Return to Origin Formation were not complex. The formation could gather part of the power of each of the nine individuals inside the formation on one person, combining the strength of all nine and using it to deal with all kinds of dangerous situations that might arise when breaking the formation.</p><p>This formation did not strictly require nine people, but if there were fewer people, the power of the formation would also be greatly reduced. If there were only two or three people, the result would be the same as having no formation at all. They would instead be limited by the formation, and it would be better to act independently and respond as they saw fit.</p><p>Only with nine people could the Return to Origin Formation achieve its maximum effectiveness.</p><p>Of the nine people in the formation, the one who received the power was also the one in charge of the formation, known as the focal point. The focal point could be rotated, but it took time, and when danger approached, there might not be enough time. Only when the person in charge was unexpectedly injured and unable to assume the responsibility of the focal point would they consider changing to someone else.</p><p>Of everyone present, Yu Kong had the highest cultivation and had also been to the Qiuhong Marketplace before. He was the undisputed head of the formation.</p><p>After Qin Sang carefully learned about the Return to Origin Formation, he felt that it was quite different from the Nine Luminaries Star River Formation. The biggest difference was the autonomy of the individuals in the formation.</p><p>Once the Nine Luminaries Star River Formation was formed, the power of everyone in it would form a river of stars, which was extremely powerful. However, the people in the formation would lose all their freedom and would be continuously drained of their spiritual power by the great formation. They would not even be able to leave the formation.</p><p>Unless there was immense trust between them.</p><p>Or, like when they had explored the ancient cultivator's legacy, when there was a great being suppressing them.</p><p>Only then would they possibly agree to set up this kind of formation.</p><p>After Sima Muyue had improved the formation, this flaw had been reduced somewhat, but it still existed.</p><p>However, just as there were pros, there were also cons. Precisely because there was less variability, it did not take much time to master the Nine Luminaries Star River Formation.</p><p>The Return to Origin Formation was different. Although the person in charge of the formation still enjoyed a great deal of power, his or her constraints on the others were not as strong. When it came to a critical moment, everyone could fly away on their own and would not have to worry about being dragged down to death by the person in charge of the formation.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that Yu Kong had chosen the Return to Origin Formation out of helplessness. After all, everyone there was a stranger to each other. It was impossible to establish much trust between them, but it also increased the instability of the formation.</p><p>Yu Kong had issued a special warning about this.</p><p>"Unless we are truly in mortal danger, no one is permitted to leave the Return to Origin Formation without permission. If you bring danger to others, do not blame me for being ruthless! I have given you fair warning, so do not say that I did not tell you in advance!"</p><p>Yu Kong put away the smile on his face, and his gaze swept coldly over everyone present, reminding them that he was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment expert, not a harmless scholar.</p><p>Under Yu Kong's harsh gaze, Qin Sang nodded with a solemn expression. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed the expressions on the faces of the others. In the end, his gaze fell on the three people who had joined later.</p><p>These three people were also loose cultivators that Yu Kong had recruited.</p><p>One of them was an old man wearing a black robe. This man was quite thin and his hands were especially skinny. They were like a pair of eagle claws, and he was known as Elder Woodvine.</p><p>His wood element incantations had reached a level of perfection.</p><p>The second was a short and fat middle-aged man named Wu Chen. Like Qin Sang, he was skilled in swordsmanship. However, his swords were hidden in the fan in his hand. The seven bones of the fan were seven sharp swords.</p><p>The last was a woman. She wore flowing red gauze, and her clothes were quite revealing. She had a flirtatious and charming demeanor. Her eyes were like flowing waves, and it was as if she was gazing at everyone with affection. Her name was also quite nice. It was Crescent Fairy.</p><p>Su Zhire had a bit of a seductive quality about her as well, but she seemed quite immature compared to Crescent Fairy. As if women repelled each other, the two women did not seem to like each other much. When they looked at each other, there was gunpowder in the air.</p><p>Crescent Fairy's magic weapon was a ball of red thread that could change its form in many ways.</p><p>Like Wu Chen's fan, it was more like a hidden weapon.</p><p>Including Qin Sang, the abilities that everyone had displayed were already quite impressive. Among loose cultivators, they were all佼佼者.</p><p>"Inside the jade slip are the various changes of the Return to Origin Formation. After you memorize them, Fellow Daoists, we will begin practicing the formation. We will depart in three months' time," Yu Kong said as he handed out jade slips one by one.</p><p>Crescent Fairy was surprised by Yu Kong's decision. She covered her mouth in exaggeration.</p><p>"Senior Yu, why are we leaving in such a hurry? Won't the Autumn Crane Bazaar open in another year?"</p><p>Moon Crescent Fairy's sweet voice was just as charming as her appearance, able to ignite a spark in the belly of those who heard it. People with weak willpower could be entranced by her voice alone.</p><p>Yu Kong, on the other hand, remained composed, ignoring Moon Crescent Fairy's coquettish behavior. He patiently explained, "The Autumn Crane Bazaar's protective formation is unpredictable. I just received news that the formation has undergone new changes.</p><p>Since the formation's vulnerable period is extremely short, we don't have much time. It's best if we arrive early and wait outside the bazaar. Once the low tide appears, we'll enter the formation immediately. Even if we can only stay for an extra hour, we might be able to obtain an additional treasure. Besides, the distance between West Wasteland Town and the Autumn Crane Bazaar is not short. By setting off early, we can travel at a leisurely pace, cultivate along the way, get to know each other better, and increase our chances of breaking the formation."</p><p>After that, they followed Yu Kong's instructions.</p><p>Three months passed in a flash. While traveling, they practiced formations and became extremely proficient in the Return to Origin Formation. As soon as time was up, they left West Wasteland Town together and headed north.</p><p>They brought ample cloud vessels and spirit pills and gradually approached the Autumn Crane Bazaar. After getting to know each other, they started working together to hunt cloud beasts. They distributed the spoils evenly, maintaining a superficially harmonious atmosphere within the team.</p><p>As time passed, they got closer and closer to the Autumn Crane Bazaar.</p><p>Everyone except Yan Wu had asked about Qin Sang's plans after entering the Autumn Crane Bazaar. Qin Sang hesitated for a while before agreeing to Yu Kong's invitation.</p><p>He also discovered that he wasn't the only one Yu Kong had invited. Everyone had probably received an invitation. However, unlike Qin Sang, who had his own reasons, most of the others were hesitant.</p><p>After observing Yu Kong for several days, Qin Sang couldn't find any clues.</p><p>Yu Kong didn't care about the rumors at all. Whenever someone mentioned it, he would dismissively remind them that this opportunity came only once every thirty years. It would be a pity to waste it on rumors. Instead, they should focus on planning how to obtain more treasures.</p><p>Through Yu Kong's stories, they gained a general understanding of the Autumn Crane Bazaar.</p><p>Chapter 282: Setting Off</p><p>Ge Yuan chuckled and said, "Senior, you overestimate me. Even if we can't find the medicinal garden, I know a few places in Autumn Fair Market where treasures are stored. If we work together, we're bound to find something, and you won't return empty-handed."</p><p>Yun Youzi smiled and nodded, only perfunctorily echoing Ge Yuan.</p><p>Qin Sang understood that Yun Youzi, like himself, was primarily interested in healing herbs. If they couldn't find them, their efforts would truly be in vain.</p><p>The three of them each dripped a drop of their blood essence onto the Harmony Pendants, merging them together.</p><p>After absorbing the blood essence, the pendants became linked to each other.</p><p>Each of them took one pendant, and after further discussion, they parted ways, each going their own way.</p><p>They agreed not to contact each other unless absolutely necessary before entering Autumn Fair Market.</p><p>…</p><p>In the small courtyard.</p><p>Everyone stood together as Yu Kong explained the Convergence Formation to them in detail.</p><p>The principle of the Convergence Formation wasn't complex. It could gather a portion of the power of the nine people within the formation and focus it onto one person, combining the strength of all nine to deal with any critical situations that might arise when breaking the formation.</p><p>The formation didn't strictly require nine people, but if the number was insufficient, its power would be greatly reduced. If there were only three or two people, it would be almost useless. In such cases, it would be better to act independently and adapt to the circumstances.</p><p>The Convergence Formation reached its maximum effectiveness with nine participants.</p><p>Among the nine, the person receiving the power was also the leader of the formation, known as the Formation Eye. The Formation Eye could be rotated, but it took time, which might not be available in a crisis.  Only if the current leader was injured and couldn't perform their duties would they consider switching to someone else.</p><p>Among the group, Yu Kong had the highest cultivation level and had previously entered Autumn Fair Market, making him the undisputed leader.</p><p>After carefully studying the Convergence Formation, Qin Sang felt it differed significantly from the Nine Radiance Star River Formation. The biggest difference lay in the autonomy of the participants.</p><p>Once the Nine Radiance Star River Formation was activated, everyone's power formed a river of stars, immensely powerful, but the participants lost all freedom.  The formation continuously drew their spiritual energy, and they couldn't even leave the formation.</p><p>Unless they deeply trusted each other,</p><p>or, like when they explored the ancient cultivator's ruins, there was a powerful figure overseeing them,</p><p>they wouldn't agree to use this formation.</p><p>The formation, as improved by Sikong Muyue, mitigated this flaw somewhat, but it still existed.</p><p>However, every advantage has its disadvantage. Precisely because of its rigidity, mastering the Nine Radiance Star River Formation didn't take long.</p><p>The Convergence Formation was different. Though the leader still held considerable power, their control over the others wasn't as absolute. In a dire situation, each person could flee without being dragged down by the leader.</p><p>---</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that Yu Kong chose the Convergence Formation out of necessity. After all, they were strangers and couldn't establish much trust, but this also increased instability.</p><p>Yu Kong specifically issued a warning about this.</p><p>"Unless your life is truly in danger, no one is allowed to leave the Convergence Formation without permission. Otherwise, if you endanger others, don't blame me for being ruthless! I've made this clear in advance, so don't say I didn't warn you!"</p><p>Yu Kong's smile vanished as he swept his gaze coldly over everyone, reminding them that he was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, not a benevolent scholar.</p><p>Under Yu Kong's gaze, Qin Sang nodded solemnly. He glanced at the others, noting their varied expressions, finally landing on the three people who had joined later.</p><p>These three were also rogue cultivators recruited by Yu Kong.</p><p>One was a withered old man in a black robe.  His hands were incredibly thin, like a pair of eagle's claws. He was known as Old Man Mu Teng.</p><p>His wood-elemental spells were incredibly powerful.</p><p>The second was a short, stout middle-aged man named Wu Chen. Like Qin Sang, he was skilled in swordsmanship, but his sword was hidden in a fan he carried. The seven fan ribs were seven sharp blades.</p><p>The last was a woman dressed in revealing red gauze. She had a seductive aura, eyes like flowing waves, as if she were flirting with everyone. Her name was equally alluring: Crescent Moon Fairy.</p><p>Xiu Zhirui also possessed a certain charm, but compared to Crescent Moon Fairy, she seemed rather naive. As women, they seemed to dislike each other, with unspoken tension between them.</p><p>Crescent Moon Fairy's magical tool was a ball of red thread, capable of various transformations.</p><p>Like Wu Chen's fan, it seemed more like a concealed weapon.</p><p>Including Qin Sang, each person demonstrated impressive strength, making them stand out even among rogue cultivators.</p><p>"These jade slips contain the various transformations of the Convergence Formation. After you memorize them, we'll begin practicing the formation. We'll set off in three months," Yu Kong said, distributing the jade slips.</p><p>Crescent Moon Fairy reacted to Yu Kong's decision with exaggerated surprise, covering her mouth with her hand. </p><p>"Senior Yu, why such haste? Isn't the Autumn Wilds Market still at least a year away from opening?"</p><p>Crescent Moon Fairy's voice, like her appearance, was utterly enchanting, igniting a warmth in the listener's core. Those with weaker wills could be easily captivated by her voice alone.</p><p>Yu Kong, however, remained unfazed by Crescent Moon Fairy's charm, patiently explaining, "The protective formation around the Autumn Wilds Market is unpredictable. I've just received news that it has shifted again.</p><p>The weakened state of the formation is fleeting, leaving us with little time.</p><p>It's best we arrive early and wait outside the market.  The moment the formation weakens, we'll enter immediately. Even a few extra minutes inside could mean acquiring another treasure.</p><p>Moreover, the journey from West Wasteland Town to the Autumn Wilds Market is considerable.  An early departure allows for a less hurried journey, giving us time to train, familiarize ourselves with each other, and improve our chances of breaking through the formation."</p><p>Following this, they adhered to Yu Kong's instructions.</p><p>Three months passed swiftly. The group cultivated and practiced their formation, becoming incredibly proficient with the Return to Origin Formation. As soon as the time arrived, they departed West Wasteland Town together, heading north.</p><p>Well-stocked with cloud artifacts, spirit pills, and other necessities, they gradually approached the Autumn Wilds Market. As they became more acquainted, they occasionally joined forces to hunt cloud beasts, dividing the spoils evenly. On the surface, the atmosphere within the group was harmonious.</p><p>As time went on, they drew ever closer to the Autumn Wilds Market.</p><p>Along the way, everyone except Yan Wu subtly inquired about Qin Sang's plans once inside the market. After a period of 'consideration,' Qin Sang accepted Yu Kong's invitation.</p><p>He also realized that Yu Kong had extended the invitation to others, likely everyone in the group.</p><p>However, unlike Qin Sang who had ulterior motives, most of the others seemed hesitant.</p><p>Despite his observations, Qin Sang couldn't discern anything unusual about Yu Kong.</p><p>Yu Kong seemed unconcerned by the rumors. Whenever they were mentioned, he would dismissively remind everyone that such an opportunity only arose every thirty years. It would be a shame to waste it on rumors. Instead, they should focus on strategizing how to obtain the most treasures.</p><p>Through Yu Kong's accounts, they gained a general understanding of the Autumn Wilds Market.</p>
