Chapter 105: The Earth Sinkhole


After Sun De left, Qin Sang looked at Zhuang Yan suspiciously, "Senior Brother Zhuang, what are the 'big pits' that Senior Brother Sun mentioned?"

Zhuang Yan sighed softly and shook his head. "Junior Brother Qin, the miscellaneous duties within the sect are indeed some tedious, some easy, but overall, they are fairly distributed.  The heavier duties come with a higher monthly stipend, and some even offer unexpected opportunities. However, they take time away from cultivation, so many disciples are reluctant to choose them.  But these tasks must be done by someone. As a senior brother, I’m in a difficult position, and I can only assign them to newly admitted disciples, which has earned me quite a bit of criticism. I find myself quite compatible with you, Junior Brother Qin.  I'll give you a list in a moment, and you can choose one yourself.  Once chosen, there's no going back. You must commit to it for five years, unless you breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment stage. How does that sound?"

Qin Sang knew that Senior Brother Zhuang had already given him face by allowing him this much leeway.  To haggle further would be ungrateful.  He expressed his gratitude, "Thank you, Senior Brother Zhuang."

As they walked and talked, Qin Sang learned that the miscellaneous duties of Shaohua Mountain weren't limited to the sect itself, but many were located elsewhere.

For example, several markets around the mountain gates were overseen by Shaohua Mountain cultivators to keep the unruly rogue cultivators in check.  These duties were quite lucrative.  Zhuang Yan frankly told Qin Sang that these were definitely out of his reach unless he could find favor with a certain senior uncle.

There were also various mortal kingdoms under Shaohua Mountain’s jurisdiction. Some were governed by cultivation families affiliated with Shaohua Mountain, while others required direct oversight from the sect.

The primary purpose was to prevent rogue cultivators, demons, and evil cultivators from wreaking havoc in the mortal world. Interference in mortal affairs and displays of supernatural power were strictly forbidden and severely punished.

After careful consideration, Qin Sang decided to choose a duty outside the mountain gate.

While searching for the Song family in the markets, he hadn't forgotten to inquire about places with potential Yin煞 energy. He had noted down a few locations, all in remote wilderness areas, but he hadn't had the chance to verify them yet.

As long as he had Soul Condensation Pills, his cultivation speed wouldn't be slower than others.  Being outside would be more convenient, and even if the spiritual energy wasn't as rich as on Shaohua Mountain, the impact wouldn't be significant.

Back in the wooden hall, Zhuang Yan handed Qin Sang a jade slip.  Upon scanning it with his divine sense, Qin Sang understood why so many duties remained unchosen.

The first was to be an alchemy assistant at Nine Cauldrons Peak. The jade slip painted a rosy picture, listing numerous examples of senior brothers and sisters who had been taken as disciples, taught the Dao of alchemy, and become alchemy masters. However, it glossed over the drawbacks – one had to tend the alchemical furnace and earth fire for at least six hours every day.

Qin Sang skipped the duties within the sect and went straight to the end of the list.  He examined each one and found a duty guarding the Earth Sinkhole.

It stated that the Earth Sinkhole was bottomless, and the entire cavern was filled with Yin煞 energy.  Shaohua Mountain had set up restrictions to seal it, requiring a disciple to constantly monitor it.  Any changes had to be immediately reported to the sect to prevent the Yin煞 energy from leaking out and causing harm to living beings.

Qin Sang was quite surprised.  For Shaohua Mountain to be so cautious, could it be that the Yin煞 energy in the Earth Sinkhole was even greater than that in the Yin煞 Abyss? He withdrew his divine sense and asked Zhuang Yan, "Senior Brother Zhuang, is the duty of guarding the Earth Sinkhole still available?"

Zhuang Yan looked at him with a strange expression, "Have you chosen this one?"

Seeing Qin Sang nod, Zhuang Yan clapped his hands in delight. "Good! The Earth Sinkhole will be entrusted to Junior Brother Qin. I'll change your identity token right away."

Qin Sang handed over his token and asked with a darkened face, "Senior Brother Zhuang, can you tell me the truth now? Is the Earth Sinkhole one of the 'big pits'?"

Zhuang Yan seemed to have shed a huge burden, his whole body relaxed.  He said with a smile, "The Earth Sinkhole is indeed recognized as one of the 'big pits'. Because the conditions inside the Earth Sinkhole are constantly changing and can’t be seen from outside the restrictions, the cave dwelling there is perpetually dark, bitterly cold, and unsuitable for those with unstable minds.  But if you can endure the solitude, it's one of the best miscellaneous duties."

Qin Sang nodded slightly, but inwardly he thought, if there’s one thing cultivators don’t lack, it’s the ability to endure solitude.  There must be something Senior Brother Zhuang wasn't telling him.

However, he needed Yin煞 energy, so as long as there was no life-threatening danger, he could endure it.

They finalized the duty on the spot. Zhuang Yan then took Qin Sang to the Dharma Hall. The senior uncle who lectured on Dharma had already arrived. As a new disciple, Qin Sang didn't have to pay spirit stones for the first month, so he joined the lecture.

Qin Sang was immediately captivated. This senior uncle lived up to his reputation. He had a profound understanding of Dharma spells, especially the Five Elements spells. Every word he spoke greatly inspired Qin Sang. Yue Wu was far inferior to him.


Previously, Qin Sang had many unanswered questions. After an hour, he had benefited greatly and secretly marveled at the difference between independent cultivators and sect disciples.

He now understood why others were reluctant to go to the Depths.

The Depths were located in a remote area, and one had to stay there year-round, missing out on many opportunities to hear the elders' lectures.

After the lecture, the disciples rose and respectfully saw the elder off. Qin Sang could still stay at Mount Shaohua for a month. He was currently facing a bottleneck at the ninth level of cultivation, so he decided to postpone his trip to the Depths and stay to listen to more lectures, hoping to avoid detours in the future.

"What miscellaneous duty did Junior Brother Qin choose?"

As everyone dispersed, Qin Sang heard Sun De's voice behind him. He turned around and said, "Greetings, Senior Brother Sun. Senior Brother Zhuang assigned me to guard the Depths."

Sun De said to Zhuang Yan, "You've tricked another one."

Zhuang Yan said proudly, "I can't be blamed for this. Junior Brother Qin chose it himself."

Sun De was stunned and looked at Qin Sang. "There's nothing wrong with going to the Depths. You'll be out of there in five years at most. Junior Brother Qin, when do you plan to leave? We can travel together."

Zhuang Yan turned to Qin Sang and explained, "Senior Brother Sun takes care of the herb garden on Mount Dianyun, which is not far from the Depths. If you encounter any trouble out there, ask Senior Brother Sun for help. He's known as 'Timely Rain' in our Mount Shaohua."

Qin Sang looked delighted. "I'll have to rely on Senior Brother Sun's care in the future. However, I still have some unfinished business and want to stay at the sect for a month. I'll travel with Senior Brother Sun next time."

...

The next day, Qin Sang flew alone to Pagoda Peak.

A newcomer's reputation was useless at Pagoda Peak. Qin Sang honestly paid his spirit stones and entered the first floor, where information on spirit herbs and fruits was kept.

An hour later, Qin Sang emerged from Pagoda Peak with a look of helplessness. Although he had anticipated it, he couldn't help but feel disappointed.

The first floor of Pagoda Peak was only for Qi Refining stage cultivators. It contained information on common spirit herbs and fruits, some of which Qin Sang had already studied at the Yuanzhao Sect. He patiently looked through everything, but as expected, he found nothing similar to the mysterious orchid.

However, it wasn't a wasted trip. At least now he could identify common spirit herbs and fruits he might encounter.

As for the second floor of Pagoda Peak, spirit stones weren't enough to gain entry. One needed the token of a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator. Qin Sang only knew Elder Wen and wasn't close to her, so he had to give up for now.

Qin Sang stayed at Mount Shaohua for a while longer. Before the month was over, he suddenly left in a hurry.
