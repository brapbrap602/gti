<h1>Chapter 743: The Storm and the Sanctuary</h1><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged at the center of the Ten Yama Formation, retrieved the Winter Netherflame, and carefully enveloped it with his Nine Nether Devilfire before cautiously removing the restrictions on the Netherflame's surface.</p><p>The Netherflame remained unruly but submitted to the Devilfire.</p><p>The difference in power between these two spiritual flames was evident upon direct contact.  It seemed that the tales of Patriarch Kui Yin's dominance in the Small Cold Region with the Ten Yama Formation were not exaggerated.</p><p>Confronting the Winter Netherflame was daunting.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had a plan, meticulously devised and simulated countless times.  After a brief pause, Qin Sang gently clenched his hand, causing the Devilfire to vibrate and slowly compress inwards.</p><p>The Netherflame retreated without much resistance, the ball of fire visibly shrinking.</p><p>But halfway through, Qin Sang abruptly stopped, sensing instability in the Netherflame.  Further forced compression might lead to disaster.</p><p>“As expected, brute force is not the solution.  I'll have to find another way."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, restoring the Netherflame to its original form. He drew a wisp of Devilfire, his fingers moving swiftly as he cast several restrictions, encasing the wisp and slowly guiding it toward the Netherflame.</p><p>……</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>After a long night of work, Qin Sang exhaled, the exhaustion on his face replaced with excitement as he gazed at the blue orb before him.</p><p>This was the Netherflame condensed into a fire pearl, a feat Qin Sang achieved after numerous attempts with various restrictions.</p><p>The pearl appeared the size of a dragon's eye but its core was only the size of a mung bean, its surface glowing with the Netherflame's aura.</p><p>Refined into this form, the Netherflame seemed even more volatile than before.</p><p>Caution was paramount; the fire pearl was indiscriminate in its destructive power.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully stored the pearl, his confidence in entering the Seven Kills Palace growing significantly.</p><p>A wave of weakness washed over him.  Refining the fire pearl had taken a heavy toll. Qin Sang quickly retracted the Ten Yama banners, activated his cultivation technique, and entered meditative recovery.</p><p>He didn't anticipate it would take a whole month.</p><p>One day, during his meditation, Qin Sang was startled awake by an incredibly powerful aura.  He darted outside, just as Cui Ji emerged from his room.</p><p>The two exchanged hostile glances.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored Cui Ji's provocation and looked up to see a figure flying in from the east, brazenly hovering above East Gate Island in full view of everyone.</p><p>Surprisingly, the individual was a Wu Clan cultivator!</p><p>“By the Grand Wu Priest's decree, the grand formation is complete. The Seven Kills Palace will open tonight at midnight!”</p><p>Without another word, the figure changed direction and flew off. Apparently, there were two other islands similar to East Gate Island, all within close proximity.</p><p>Cultivators intending to enter the Seven Kills Palace were waiting on these three islands.</p><p>The announcement caused an uproar.</p><p>After waiting for so long, the Seven Kills Palace was finally opening.</p><p>Several beams of light shot up from East Gate Island as the Nascent Soul Patriarchs, unable to contain their anticipation any longer, took to the skies.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his gaze, his eyes sweeping across the crowd until they landed on Xiang Yi striding toward him. "The Seven Kills Palace is about to open. We'll depart shortly. If any of you have unfinished preparations, attend to them immediately."</p><p>The young man with the sword grinned excitedly. "I've been ready and waiting for this day!"</p><p>The others nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Xiang Yi led the way, the others following closely behind.</p><p>The city bustled with activity as streams of light flew out from East Gate Island.</p><p>Upon leaving the island, they chose a less crowded route, detouring for some distance before heading toward the storm.</p><p>"Some individuals harbor malicious intentions, using the storm as cover to rob and kill. While our strength should protect us, caution is still advised."</p><p>Xiang Yi's voice echoed in their minds. Everyone summoned their most prized magical treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang, clad in the Golden Radiance Armor, was prepared for most situations. He simply summoned his Ebony Sword and soared into the air.</p><p>Cui Ji glanced sideways at Qin Sang, noting he hadn't summoned the Ten Yama banners, and sneered inwardly. He still believed the Foul Purple Gloom Pearl was powered by the Nine Nether Devilfire, unaware of the Ebony Sword's true role.</p><p>The storm drew closer.</p><p>As they approached the storm belt, a strange expression crossed Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Although one of the Liu couple was a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, they were down-to-earth and approachable. Qin Sang was more familiar with them than with the others.</p><p>The Liu husband noticed Qin Sang's odd expression and asked curiously, "Daoist Priest, have you discovered something?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, then added, "I've long heard tales of the storm here, its power comparable to that of heaven and earth. Seeing it today, the rumors are indeed true. I merely worry about the consequences of becoming lost within the storm."</p><p>Hearing this, Xiang Yi turned and said, "Don't worry, fellow Daoists. The jade pendants we possess can sense the Seven Kills Palace's grand formation, providing directional guidance within a certain range. After obtaining your treasures and leaving the palace, follow the jade pendant's guidance, and you'll emerge safely. Of course, the risk of getting lost within the storm is real, even in its outer regions. If you stray into the depths of the storm, even a Nascent Soul Patriarch would be obliterated, so do not lose your jade pendants…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded absently.</p><p>He was still in shock.</p><p>Upon arrival, seeing the barriers holding back the storm, Qin Sang's long-held suspicions were confirmed.</p><p>These barriers, composed of ancient restrictions, with mysterious runes flickering within, strongly resembled those at the edge of the Small Cold Region's ancient battlefield.</p><p>Yet, there were differences.  There were no gaps like the Seven Heroes Pass, but this didn't hinder passage.</p><p>Furthermore, the storm behind the barrier bore similarities to the celestial phenomena during the Small Cold Region's spiritual tide.</p><p>The key difference was that the ancient battlefield was on land, whereas this was the vast ocean.</p><p>Moreover, the storm here raged relentlessly, the waves crashing endlessly, while the Small Cold Region's spiritual tide occurred only periodically.</p><p>"Could the edges of the Boundless Sea also be surrounded by an ancient battlefield?"</p><p>Qin Sang's curiosity about this world deepened.</p><p>He didn't know what other places were like, but the two he had visited, the Small Cold Region and the Boundless Sea, seemed like sanctuaries in a world ravaged by disaster.</p><p>Those barriers, legacies of past sages, held back the dangers, creating havens for future generations to thrive.</p><p>It was said that the edges of the Demon Sea were similar to the Boundless Sea.</p><p>"What kind of world is this?"</p><p>Qin Sang marveled, filled with a desire to grow stronger and unravel the world's mysteries.</p><p>"Take out your jade pendants and activate your magical treasures to withstand the storm."</p><p>Xiang Yi commanded. He didn't seem to summon any treasure, but a cyan protective aura emanated from his body, likely from protective clothing similar to the Golden Radiance Armor.</p><p>Xiang Yi held the jade pendant in his hands, channeling his true essence into it, causing the pendant to glow with a white light.  He then flashed through the barrier and into the storm.</p><p>The others followed suit.</p><p>Qin Sang cast aside his wonder and amazement, quickly joining them.</p>
