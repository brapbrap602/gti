Chapter 312: Mid-Foundation Establishment

Three days later.

His cultivation had risen sharply.

As expected, once he had fully digested the medicinal properties of the pill, he needed some time to steady his cultivation base, then he could inscribe the killing talisman and break through to the mid-Foundation Establishment realm in one go.

For a moment, Qin Sang did not know whether to feel happy or worried.

This situation only meant one thing; the medicinal properties of the Imprint Harmony Pill were extremely sufficient, but perhaps the formula was not quite right for him, or to say its medicinal strength was not powerful enough.

The damage caused by the Profound Female Jade Cauldron Scripture might be even more severe than he had guessed.

Qin Sang opened his eyes, his expression grave.

Although he had suspected this for some time, he realized that he had still underestimated the Profound Female Jade Cauldron Scripture. This method was incomparable to ordinary evil techniques that collected yin and yang.

After all, it was a method that could help Foundation Establishment cultivators form their Nascent Soul!

The Harmony Pill, Five Treasure Divine Paste, and Snow Ginseng Jade Life Pill had medicinal properties that were not inferior to the Imprint Harmony Pill.

If this was really the case, even if he took more spiritual pills like these, he would not be able to fully recover. At best, he could only recover a little more.

He should be searching for even more powerful spiritual pills, or for the divine medicines recorded in ancient books such as Daoist Herbs and Vermilion Cloud Purple Fruit.

The good news was that he was about to break through to the mid-Foundation Establishment realm. He did not feel any impediment from his foundation. From the surface, the only influence seemed to be his Spirit Sea.

For a moment, countless thoughts surged up in Qin Sang’s heart.

Finally, Qin Sang gently narrowed his eyes and entered silent cultivation.

Cultivation has no time.

Time passed day by day. In the blink of an eye, three years had passed.

The cave dwelling had long been covered with thick snow. Looking with the naked eye, it was impossible to tell that there was a cultivator’s cave dwelling here.

Nobody had disturbed him for three years.

Qin Sang refined his medicinal properties and stabilized his cultivation, while he also inscribed the killing talisman stroke by stroke, not missing a single step.

A year ago, the Ebony Wood Sword had already inscribed two complete killing talismans. The Divine Will Nurturing Sword Scripture had broken through to the third layer, and Qin Sang had also successfully entered the mid-Foundation Establishment realm.

This year, he had completely stabilized his realm after his breakthrough.

“Hoo!”

A gale blew out from inside, scattering the snow.

Qin Sang removed the restriction and walked out of his cave dwelling. He saw the brilliant daylight outside, it was the middle of the day. He raised his head and looked at the blue sky and bright sun which he had not seen in three years. After a long while, he withdrew his gaze with some emotion.

Next, Qin Sang’s figure flashed and transformed into an escape light, flying towards Yun Youzi’s cave dwelling.

Moments later.

The escape light landed in front of a snowy valley. Yun Youzi’s cave dwelling was built in the snowy valley. There was an unfrozen ice spring inside. The environment was much better than Qin Sang’s cave dwelling.

Qin Sang landed from his escape light and was about to activate his spiritual power to trigger the restriction when a fluctuation suddenly appeared next to him. Next, several Qi Condensation cultivators wearing armor appeared. They were the guards of the Xuanlu Guard.

“Gan Ying greets Senior.”

The leading Xuanlu Guard gave Qin Sang a bow and said, “Uncle-Master Yun Youzi is currently in seclusion and has already given an order to forbid anyone from disturbing him. Senior, if you have an urgent matter, you can leave a sound transmission talisman. Once Uncle-Master comes out of seclusion, we will pass it on to him.”

This area belonged to the territory of the Heaven and Earth Pill Pavilion. It seemed that this person was a guard arranged there by the Heaven and Earth Pill Pavilion.

Qin Sang frowned and withdrew his spiritual power.

He had intended to appropriately inform Yun Youzi of his situation and ask for advice. After all, Yun Youzi was skilled in the Dao of Pills and his experience far surpassed his own. Perhaps he would have a solution.

Since he had not come out of seclusion, he did not want to disturb him.

“Forget it, I originally wanted to talk with an old friend, but since Senior Yun Youzi is in seclusion, I will not disturb him. It is also unnecessary to leave a sound transmission talisman. Once Senior comes out of seclusion, you can just tell him that Qin Sang visited.”

Qin Sang shook his head and asked, “Fellow Daoist, I wonder when Senior began this seclusion? Did he leave any messages before he entered seclusion about when he would come out?”

The Xuanlu Guard said everything he knew. “Uncle-Master began this seclusion three years ago and did not leave any messages.”

Also three years ago, they had entered seclusion almost at the same time.

This meant that Yun Youzi had also refined the spiritual pill he needed, but he did not know whether or not his divine soul had been healed.

Qin Sang nodded secretly and fell into contemplation for a moment. Then, he rode his escape light again and headed north, entering the Xuanlu Pass.

As his cultivation had increased, he needed to report it to the sect.

After breaking through to the mid-Foundation Establishment realm, there would be greater danger in the tasks he was assigned. However, the rewards and bonuses would be much more generous. Qin Sang considered his situation. He had valuable treasures and a sha corpse as an assistant whose strength was not weak. His strength surpassed that of ordinary mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators. Furthermore, Senior Brother Qi Yuanjie was in control of the situation.

Overall, the benefits outweighed the drawbacks.

Entering the city, Qin Sang went straight to the hall and met Yu Yangzi.

Yu Yangzi was a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator. After many years, his aura was much stronger than before. Although he had not broken through to the late-Foundation Establishment realm, he was surely not far away.

Old acquaintances reunited. After hearing Qin Sang’s good news, Yu Yangzi was very happy for him. The two of them visited Qi Yuanjie together, exchanging their cultivation experiences as they walked.

Yu Yangzi had been friendly to him in the past, but had never mentioned cultivation to Qin Shang of his own accord.
This was just another consequence of the changes wrought by his advancement in cultivation.
Qin Shang felt a sense of wonder in his heart, but maintained a calm demeanor, and proceeded to ask Yu Yangzi for advice, which cleared up a number of his uncertainties.
As the pair journeyed together towards the tunnel, they encountered several people, who were also fellow disciples of Mount Shaohua, one of whom was Yu Daiyue.
“Greetings, Martial arts brother Yu,” Qin Shang clasped his hands in greeting and noted that Yu Daiyue was still in the early stages of Foundation Building, having not yet broken through the bottleneck, and he could not help but sigh inwardly.
He had first met Yu Daiyue by the gourd of the Red Dust, when Yu Daiyue had already been an advanced stage Qi Refining cultivator, and had also agreed to act as the cauldron in order to breakthrough.
The pair had later ventured together into the catacombs of the Heavenly Corpse sect, and had then travelled to the ancient Immortal Battlefield together in search of opportunity, thirty years had passed by in the blink of an eye.
Today, he himself had broken through to the middle stage of Foundation Building, while Yu Daiyue was still lagging far behind, and might even fail to make any further progress in his lifetime.
The vicissitudes of life were truly inscrutable.
“Martial Arts brother Qin, you are also on your way to meet Martial arts brother Qi...”
Halfway through his sentence, Yu Daiyue suddenly sensed Qin Shang’s aura, his eyes went wide, and an expression of shock spread across his face, his voice was tinged with disbelief.
“You... You have already broken through to the middle stage of Foundation Building?”
“It was just a stroke of luck that I was able to seize the opportunity to breakthrough,” Since he would be meeting Qi Yuan Shou, Qin Shang had not used the “Spirit Concealment Arts” to conceal his cultivation, so Yu Daiyue had seen through his disguise. He replied calmly.
Yu Yangzi laughed aloud, “Martial arts brother Qin, there is no need to be so self-deprecating, to be able to break through to the middle stage of Foundation Building at your age is not considered slow for our sect, and the prospect of forming a golden core in the future is not insignificant, within a hundred years, perhaps Mount Shaohua will have another Golden Core Cultivator!”
Qin Shang knew that Yu Yangzi was just being polite, and hurriedly said that he dared not accept such praise.
The other people all offered their congratulations to Qin Shang.
Yu Daiyue, however, looked rather absent-minded and dispirited, he forced himself to utter a few words, and then left with the others.
Qin Shang watched as Yu Daiyue’s rather desolate form disappeared into the distance and sighed inwardly.
