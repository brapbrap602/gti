<h1>Chapter 740: Bottleneck</h1><p>Chapter 740: Bottleneck</p><p>Qin Sang attempted to cultivate the unique technique created by Elder Qingzhu.</p><p>Initially, the comprehension process went smoothly, as it was consistent with her original technique.</p><p>But when Qin Sang truly began cultivation and tried to inscribe the sixth killing talisman onto her natal spirit sword, she encountered problems.</p><p>Firstly, the new killing talisman didn't provide as much assistance to cultivation as a genuine one.</p><p>With a genuine talisman, Qin Sang's cultivation speed would have rivaled that of a dual-spiritual root cultivator, truly placing her among the most talented.</p><p>Currently, there was still a considerable gap.</p><p>Secondly, the killing talisman created by Elder Qingzhu wasn't perfect. While Qin Sang could cultivate it, it wasn't perfectly compatible with her, risking collapse if she was careless.  Therefore, it placed very high demands on both the cultivator and the natal spirit sword.</p><p>As a result, if the Wumu Sword wasn't upgraded, it might not be able to withstand the full power of the complete killing talisman.</p><p>In other words, Qin Sang would face the predicament of her natal spirit sword collapsing mid-cultivation during the mid-Core Formation stage; the bottleneck arrived prematurely and unexpectedly.</p><p>The situation was more severe than Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>"Bottleneck! Bottleneck! I only have a few decades left, and I haven't even found a lead yet. Searching blindly, can I really find the Ten Divine Trees? Will I really have to return to Xiaohan Domain and search for the Wujiang Blood Mulberry in Wuyagou?"</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from her meditative state, gazing at the ceiling of her cave abode with a detached expression.</p><p>The *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* was too unique. Switching to another technique would not only regress her cultivation speed to that of a five-spiritual root cultivator, but the cost would be too great to bear, potentially losing her chance to advance to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Even with the slightest glimmer of hope, Qin Sang wouldn't consider it.</p><p>"The good news is, Elder Qingzhu's technique isn't that profound; there's a method to it. To a certain extent, even without inscribing the killing talisman, I can comprehend most of its essence. Once I find suitable spirit wood and upgrade the Wumu Sword, inscribing the talismans will be much easier and faster. But the time gained this way is still limited; this problem will eventually present itself."</p><p>"There's another way—to use refinement techniques when inscribing the killing talismans. Continued research into refinement should allow me to inscribe a few more. Luckily, I had this idea before, so it's a bit of foresight. Now I've made some progress, and there's a high chance of success."</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang sighed, "They're all temporary fixes, not addressing the root cause."</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang continued her quiet cultivation.</p><p>While cultivating, she also thought about how to improve her refinement techniques. Allowing the Wumu Sword to carry more killing talismans.</p><p>Unbeknownst to her, time flew by during cultivation, and more than two years passed in a flash.</p><p>During those two years, Qin Sang hardly left her cave abode.</p><p>She dedicated herself to cultivation and studied refinement and prohibition techniques, experimenting repeatedly and enduring countless failures.  Finally, she compiled some rudimentary refinement and prohibition techniques that could stabilize the Wumu Sword.</p><p>This was only a prototype; there was much room for improvement.</p><p>"I didn't expect to be secluded here for so long because of the technique; this wasn't in my plans.  There are less than three years left until the Qisha Hall opens. After touring the entire Yao Sea, going to the Inner Sea will be tight, I can't just take a cursory look. It's better to stay in the Yao Sea for the remaining time, and then stay in the Inner Sea for a while after coming out of the Qisha Hall."</p><p>Qin Sang left the cave abode, made her decision, summoned her two-headed flying beast, checked her direction, and disappeared into the azure sea.</p><p>…</p><p>Dahuang Island.</p><p>The gateway for human cultivators to enter the Yao Sea.</p><p>Like Tianwu Island, this island was heavily guarded, extremely vast, resembling a small continent—a rare large island in the Yao Sea. Not only did cultivators come and go, but ordinary people also farmed there.</p><p>After over fifty years of teleportation, Qin Sang set foot on Dahuang Island for the first time.</p><p>Legend has it that Dahuang Island was the first island occupied by cultivators entering the Yao Sea, holding extraordinary significance. Back then, the Yao Sea was a truly wild place.</p><p>Actually, it's not much better now; the area occupied by cultivators of both races is still insignificant compared to the entire Yao Sea.</p><p>She stood before the city gate, gazing at the giant city.</p><p>After nearly three years of travels, Qin Sang had visited almost all the islands in the Yao Sea, experiencing both gains and disappointments.</p><p>Every time she arrived at a place, Qin Sang's first priority was to inquire about news of the Ten Divine Trees.  To that end, she actively contacted many people, including the confidants of island lords and independent, powerful solitary cultivators.</p><p>The Yao Sea was a treasure trove; besides the demonic beasts, with good luck, one could discover medicinal herbs and magical flowers on unexplored islands.</p><p>For example, the Six-Petaled Butterfly Violet on Hongye Island.</p><p>Searching for the Ten Divine Trees in the Demon Sea is a long shot, but not entirely impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang's escape techniques are unparalleled; he dares to venture into the most dangerous places.  However, frustratingly, there isn't even a rumor, let alone any concrete information.</p><p>Hope rests with the Inner Sea.</p><p>The Inner Sea has been occupied by cultivators since ancient times, boasting ancient traditions.  Within its legends, clues might be found. Some top sects may even possess the Ten Divine Trees, unbeknownst to the world.</p><p>Entering the city, Qin Sang bypassed the shops, heading directly to a small courtyard.</p><p>*Knock knock…*</p><p>He knocked on the door.</p><p>The courtyard looked no different from its neighbors, its gate a common wooden one.  But the information from Elder Zou led him here, to rendezvous with other cultivators from the East Pole Alliance before entering the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang held great respect for the massive East Pole Alliance. Though he detected no restrictions around the courtyard, he refrained from using his spiritual sense to investigate.</p><p>*Creak…*</p><p>Soon, the wooden door opened, revealing a kind-faced elder.</p><p>"What brings you here, sir?"</p><p>Despite only being at the Foundation Establishment stage, the elder remained composed.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke gently, "Old sir, I purchased a token some time ago, and this is to claim it.  Please inform your master."</p><p>He presented the token from the Qiongyu Trading Company.</p><p>A gleam flashed in the elder's eyes. After carefully examining the token, he smiled. "So it's Daoist Qingfeng. My master has been awaiting your arrival. Please, come in."</p><p>Entering the courtyard, Qin Sang discovered a hidden world, with several elegant wooden buildings, their protective formations shimmering with considerable power.</p><p>The elder led him to one building and bowed. "My master is currently visiting a guest and will return in the evening. Please rest for a while."</p><p>"Very well."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, pausing before the building to observe the others.</p><p>He sensed faint auras emanating from within, indicating the arrival of others.</p>
