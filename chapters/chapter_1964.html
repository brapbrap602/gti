<h1>Chapter 1955: Wang Zuo</h1><p>Qin Sang flew slowly over the Fire Domain.</p><p>The Fire Domain was vast and sparsely populated, but Qin Sang could occasionally sense cultivators moving through the lava flows, searching for something.</p><p>He even found two Yuan Ying cultivators wandering near his Daoist temple.</p><p>The temple was sealed by a spirit formation, so they couldn't sense it.</p><p>Entering the temple, Qin Sang immediately summoned Gui Hou.</p><p>When Gui Hou arrived, Qin Sang gave him a pouch.</p><p>“Take these to Qingyang Temple, obtain the Earth Travel Boat, and go to Mulu Mountain…”</p><p>Yun Du Tian was preparing for a great war, and Mulu Mountain would certainly not lag behind. Qin Sang wanted to take advantage of this opportunity.</p><p>Several of his Nascent Soul experts had grievances with Ling Shi and Luo Hun Yuan. Gui Hou, with his superior strength and intelligence, and the Earth Travel Boat, was more than capable of protecting himself.</p><p>“When you have free time, stay at Qingyang Temple.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Gui Hou bowed and left. He first found Ling Shi to learn about the situation in Mulu Mountain, then left the temple and headed south.</p><p>Qin Sang went directly to the Fire Chamber. With a wave of his hand, he was surrounded by orbs of light – various magic treasures and spiritual materials.</p><p>…</p><p>After Gui Hou arrived at Qingyang Temple, he was also called to the underground chamber.</p><p>Three Nascent Soul experts waited before the main altar for instructions.</p><p>The pouch from their master contained some of the spiritual materials needed to build the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang had recorded the altar construction method on a jade slip, which he gave to the three demons.</p><p>He would be stationed at the main altar; the construction of the branch altars could be handled by the three demons.</p><p>Gui Hou took the jade slip and the Earth Travel Boat, and immediately rushed to Mulu Mountain.</p><p>Luo Hou and Taiyi, remaining at Qingyang Temple, thoroughly studied the contents of the jade slip and then set off with the spiritual materials.</p><p>The restoration of the altar array begins today!</p><p>…</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi and the Yin family did not reveal their experiences at Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Xiao Wu and Yu Lang lived peaceful lives at Qingyang Temple, interacting mainly with the villagers of Qipai Village, students from the school, and those who came seeking medicine.</p><p>Here, they felt no trace of the turbulent changes in the cultivation world.</p><p>The weather turned cold.</p><p>Yellow leaves fell.</p><p>‘……’</p><p>Several fast horses galloped towards Qipai Village on the main road.</p><p>The leader, dressed in fine brocade, was full of spirit, his brows elegant – a truly handsome young gentleman.</p><p>Those behind him, all in tight-fitting clothes and carrying swords, were his attendants and bodyguards.</p><p>These men had prominent temples, their riding postures and formations unusual. Their eyes were sharp and alert, wary of any potential enemy.</p><p>Seeing Qipai Village and the lush bamboo forest from afar, the young gentleman smiled and flicked his reins.</p><p>“Giddy up!”</p><p>Their speed increased dramatically. His attendants effortlessly kept up, their horsemanship extremely refined.</p><p>Rounding a corner, the young gentleman gave a soft exclamation.</p><p>He saw a large stone at the entrance to the bamboo forest, inscribed with the words “Those seeking medicine enter here,” and a villager standing guard beside it.</p><p>‘Whoa!’</p><p>The young gentleman reined in his horse, glanced at the back mountain of Qipai Village, and asked in a low voice: “My good fellow, the school should be in the bamboo forest, right? Why should those seeking medicine go inside? Is Qingfeng Daoist no longer at Qingyang Temple?”</p><p>The villager, seeing the visitor's attire, hastily rose and said with a smile, “Sir, you must be a visitor. The teacher at the school is Yu Lang Daoist from Qingyang Temple.  Yu Lang Daoist is Qingfeng Daoist's disciple. Qingfeng Daoist is getting on in years, and he passed the temple on to Yu Lang Daoist. Yu Lang Daoist teaches at the school during the day and sleeps at the temple at night.”</p><p>“Yu Lang became the master?”</p><p>A smile touched the young gentleman's lips.  He dismounted and instructed his attendants to wait outside.</p><p>Several bamboo huts had been built outside the school for consultations.</p><p>The villager asked the young gentleman to sit and wait, then went inside to announce his arrival.</p><p>The young gentleman sat patiently, a hint of unconcealed excitement in his expression. He took out a jade pendant and played with it in his hands.</p><p>After a while, footsteps were heard outside.</p><p>A young Daoist in a green robe entered; it was Yu Lang.</p><p>Seeing the smiling young gentleman, Yu Lang was startled, his face full of surprise: “You are… Nao Teng?”</p><p>It was Tao Teng, a childhood friend he hadn't seen in many years!</p><p>He could still see traces of his old friend in his features.</p><p>At first glance, Yu Lang hesitated to recognize him, as his friend's demeanor had changed so much.</p><p>In their youth, Tao Teng's family was well-off, but he was just a wealthy young master.</p><p>Tao Teng now exudes an air of wealth and authority, a bearing even the magistrate of Jian County lacked!</p><p>He and his family moved to the capital.  Initially, a few letters arrived, but contact gradually ceased due to the distance.</p><p>Yu Lang recalled the Taos were merchants, and their move to the capital was for business purposes.</p><p>But this aura... only a noble family could cultivate such refinement!</p><p>Tao Teng's smile faltered.  He angrily retorted, "You barely recognized me, yet you remember my nickname perfectly!"</p><p>That fleeting expression brought back memories for Yu Lang.</p><p>"It's you, you rascal!"</p><p>Yu Lang circled Tao Teng, his voice full of wonder.  "So the Tao family has prospered in the capital?"</p><p>"And you've changed as well.  That ethereal air... I've only seen it in Master."</p><p>Tao Teng's expression was complex. He sighed, "You are a cultivator!"</p><p>"You!"</p><p>Yu Lang was truly stunned.</p><p>Qipai Village is remote; no cultivator would come here deliberately. He had never bothered to conceal his cultivation.  Even so, a mortal couldn't possibly discern his true nature.</p><p>Yet, as Yu Lang examined Tao Teng, he sensed no fluctuation of spiritual energy within him.</p><p>"So only you can have a heavenly destiny?"</p><p>Tao Teng smirked triumphantly. "You little novice, you kept it from me! Today, I get my revenge!"</p><p>He gently stroked a jade pendant; the pendant glowed, and his aura instantly shifted, revealing him to be a cultivator!</p><p>Yu Lang was amazed.  "Late-stage Qi Refinement!"</p><p>When they last parted, Tao Teng was still a mortal.</p><p>"You've already established your foundation! I'm still not as good as you!"</p><p>Tao Teng looked dejected for a moment, then quickly resumed his smug demeanor. "Well? Shocked?"</p><p>Yu Lang nodded honestly. "I truly didn't expect it. Did you find a master in the capital?"</p><p>"It's a long story…"</p><p>Tao Teng cast a spell to block outside sounds, then sat down opposite Yu Lang.</p><p>"Remember the Drunk Fragrance Tower? Back then, I sensed that the storyteller and your master weren't ordinary people. After returning to the capital, I always regretted leaving early that day. Later, while out for a spring outing, I stumbled into the deep mountains, unexpectedly encountering my master.  He took me in, and I finally learned about the existence of the immortal path…"</p><p>Tao Teng lowered his voice, curious. "Were Master Qingfeng and the storyteller hidden masters?"</p><p>"After that drinking session, Senior Qingyuan left and never returned. As for my master, I've never seen him use his power. He's probably incredibly strong…"</p><p>Yu Lang recalled the ghost of Jian County, the young man surnamed Shi, and the entire Yin family showing utmost respect to his master.  The Yin family head was rumored to be a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p>Tao Teng sighed deeply, slapping his thigh. "That day, my servant was so insistent on taking me away. I didn't hear the two masters discuss the Dao, a missed opportunity for immortal destiny!"</p><p>To this day, Tao Teng deeply regretted it.</p><p>"I didn't understand most of what Master and Senior Qingyuan discussed. It's still a blur.  If you want to know, I'll tell you later," Yu Lang said.</p><p>"Good brother! I haven't forgotten you!"</p><p>Tao Teng was overjoyed, grasping Yu Lang's hand.  "After becoming a disciple, Master kept me in the mountains to cultivate, rarely allowing me to go out; I didn't have a chance to write to you. It wasn't until last year that Master allowed me to descend the mountain.  Though I couldn't visit you, I've already heard of your great name.  I arranged my affairs and immediately came to Jian County to find you!"</p><p>"What sect did you join?"</p><p>Yu Lang hesitated.</p><p>Another question remained unasked.</p><p>Tao Teng's refined air made him look like a wealthy nobleman who had enjoyed worldly pleasures, not a cultivator.</p><p>Could the cultivation world in the capital be like this?</p><p>"I don't know what sect it is. Master wouldn't tell me, saying I'm too weak and would bring shame to the sect!"</p><p>Tao Teng scratched his head, noticing Yu Lang's gaze. He chuckled, stood up, and adjusted his robes and accessories, boasting,  "How's this attire? The finest Huizhou silk and Xishan jade from Yan, imperial tributes!"</p><p>Before Yu Lang could respond, Tao Teng pointed to the school and said, "Unlike you, I'm truly descending the mountain, becoming a mortal."</p><p>"Becoming a mortal…"</p><p>Yu Lang was even more puzzled.</p><p>He now knew that the difference between immortals and mortals went beyond strength.</p><p>Cultivators stay away from worldly affairs, partly because of the heavenly gods' observation, and partly because the world is full of temptations that cloud the Dao heart and hinder cultivation.</p><p>Did Tao Teng cultivate some unique method, or did he not take cultivation seriously?</p><p>"Exactly! After descending the mountain last year, I sought an audience with the crown prince and became his advisor, assisting him in succeeding to the throne. Those men outside are the prince's guards, protecting me!"</p><p>Tao Teng said solemnly.</p><p>He seemed unaware that his words, once spread, would cause a sensation in Yan.</p><p>Yu Lang, a schoolteacher, possessed some understanding of Yan's court politics. The current emperor was aging, and undercurrents swirled beneath the surface of the court. The Crown Prince, the emperor's eldest and legitimate son, lived a secluded life in the East Palace, reputed to be weak-willed.  Among the princes, the second prince was the most popular, known for his brilliance, military prowess, and the emperor's favor.  The other princes also participated in government affairs and enjoyed good reputations.</p><p>Tao Teng, a cultivator, was not only interfering in court politics but also assisting the Crown Prince's ascension! Could the spirits of Yan's capital city possibly allow this?</p><p>"My master has connections with the city god of Yan's capital.  I swore before the city god that, regardless of success or failure, I would never use even a fraction of my magical power to interfere in the affairs of mortals.  And at an opportune time, I will feign my death and live as a true mortal."</p><p>Tao Teng opened his palm, showing Yu Lang a jade pendant. "This city god's jade was bestowed by the city god. It masks my aura and seals my cultivation.  If I attempt to use spiritual energy, the city god will immediately detect it, and punishment will follow without mercy!"</p><p>Yu Lang suddenly understood why he couldn't sense Tao Teng's cultivation.  Yet, he remained perplexed. "Why are you doing this?"</p><p>"Remember what I said at the Drunk Fragrance Pavilion? The storyteller asked me, 'What is the Way of Man?' I answered: filial piety between father and son, loyalty between ruler and subject, proper separation of husband and wife, order of seniority, and trustworthiness among friends.  I also answered:  'When the Way prevails in the world, the world will be governed for the common good; meritocracy will be practiced, and honesty and harmony will be fostered. People will not only care for their own parents and children, but will ensure that the elderly have a peaceful end, the strong are utilized, the young grow up healthy, and the widowed, orphaned, solitary, disabled, and infirm are all taken care of.' But…"</p><p>Tao Teng stood, gazing outside the bamboo hut.  "The storyteller didn't seem to agree.  Afterward, I pondered deeply, but I couldn't think of a better ideal of a prosperous world. So I dedicated myself to study, vowing to pass the imperial examinations, enter the court, and one day, create such a world with my own hands, proving I was right!"</p><p>Watching his childhood friend, Yu Lang's expression grew serious. He had already guessed his friend's intentions.</p><p>"Until I learned about cultivators, transcending mortals.  Mortals' lifelong efforts, passed down through generations, can be wiped out with a single finger by a cultivator! The Way of Man does not lie with mortals! Thankfully, there is the divine path, which can deter immortals and demons. Otherwise, if more cultivators of demonic arts emerged, casually sacrificing cities and nations, the human world would become a hellscape. Yet, the spirits merely see mortals as sources of offerings. My master told me that the divine path values goodness, but hearts can change, and not all deities are benevolent. Some spirits, to gain more offerings, secretly instigate wars."</p><p>Tao Teng sighed deeply and sat down again. "I told my master my wish, begging him to allow me to descend into the mortal realm and try.  Regardless of success or failure, only then could my thoughts find peace; even delaying my cultivation would be worth it. Of course, I won't be as naive as before.  If I can implement good governance in Yan, ensuring peace and prosperity for the people, I will be satisfied."</p><p>Hearing this, Yu Lang deeply admired his childhood friend, amazed by the lengths he was willing to go to.</p><p>"You chose the Crown Prince," Yu Lang mused.</p><p>Tao Teng nodded. "Yes, the Crown Prince is legitimate, inherently kind, excels in both civil and military affairs, and is sufficiently patient. A dragon can be large or small; large, it creates clouds and mist; small, it hides its form! I've secretly met several princes. The second prince is the most powerful, appearing brilliant and valiant, yet he is autocratic, fond of intrigue, and doesn't seem fit to be a ruler…"</p><p>Listening to Tao Teng's assessment of the princes, Yu Lang exclaimed, "I never imagined you'd be willing to become a subject, to live beneath mortals."</p><p>The instant he spoke those words, Yu Lang was startled.  The words were so natural, so casual.  Years ago, the death of his teacher at the hands of a cultivator's spirit beast had left him heartbroken. At the Drunk Fragrance Pavilion, he had asked: "Must mortals be mere prey?" In just a few years, had he been subtly changed, believing cultivators should naturally rule over mortals? No wonder his master said that the hardest part of cultivation is upholding one's original heart! Yu Lang almost broke into a cold sweat.</p><p>"A monarch should embrace the world; that has nothing to do with cultivation!"</p><p>Tao Teng didn't notice his companion's unusual reaction and dismissed it. "Mortals can't cultivate, but they can practice martial arts.  As the saying goes, 'Learn the arts of literature and warfare; serve the emperor.' Among mortals, there are still innate masters serving as generals and commanders; their martial prowess far surpasses that of the emperor, yet they willingly serve as his aides. As long as he is a wise ruler, why can't I?"</p>
