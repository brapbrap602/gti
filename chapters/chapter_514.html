<h1>Chapter 507: Extermination</h1><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi conferred on the small island until nightfall before departing to make their preparations. After setting a meeting time with Yun Youzi, Qin Sang returned to the Earth-Sinking Cave.  He saw that Feitian Yecha's condition hadn't improved, making it unusable for this mission. He refined numerous Shao Yin magnetic bottles, nearly filling his pouch, and set off eastwards alone, carrying a substantial amount of earth煞 energy.</p><p>…</p><p>Dihuoshan.</p><p>The location of the Moyanmen sect.</p><p>Dihuoshan is a low-lying volcano, inconspicuous amidst the towering mountains.  Jiupao Daoist chose this location for the sect's base because of its remoteness; it was unlikely to be discovered by other cultivators, minimizing the risk of exposure for the remaining Kuiyin Sect members.</p><p>After its establishment, Moyanmen maintained a low profile, secretly gathering the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect.  After killing Jiupao Daoist, Qin Sang had planned to completely wipe out Moyanmen. However, Feitian Yecha was nearly destroyed, forcing him to prioritize its recovery.  Later preparations for his Golden Core advancement further delayed his attention to Moyanmen.</p><p>“The Moyanmen leader and the Four Flame Envoys are all dead by my hand.  With no high-ranking members appearing for over a year, I wonder what the state of Moyanmen is now, and if any disciples remain?”  Qin Sang murmured, silently flying through the forest towards the Moyanmen mountain gate, gazing at the distant mountains.</p><p>He wasn't sure if this mission would be successful.  With the disappearance of the five high-ranking members for so long, Moyanmen might be in disarray, its members scattered.</p><p>After crossing several mountain ranges, Qin Sang finally saw the Moyanmen mountain gate.  To the east, north, and west of Dihuoshan stood three towering peaks, forming a solid barrier that guarded the volcano. Compared to these three peaks, Dihuoshan appeared small and stout.</p><p>Faint flames flickered on the summit of Dihuoshan, a sign that it was an active volcano, although it wasn't likely to erupt in the near future.</p><p>There were two types of disciples within Moyanmen.</p><p>One type consisted of the remaining Kuiyin Sect members. Those with higher cultivation bases assisted Jiupao Daoist in gathering treasures; those with lower cultivation hid their identities, rarely leaving their refuge.</p><p>The other type were disciples who joined Moyanmen after its establishment. These disciples didn't cultivate the Kuiyin Sect's demonic arts but a different technique developed by Jiupao Daoist, one that utilized the volcano's geothermal energy.  They were fortunate; Jiupao Daoist no longer dared to recklessly refine the Ten Directions Yama Banner, so they were safe from becoming its sacrificial offerings.</p><p>Jiupao Daoist's plan was perfect. Once these disciples reached sufficient cultivation, they could openly travel. By then, Jiupao Daoist would have successfully possessed Ji Wu's body, changing his appearance, allowing Moyanmen to escape the shadow of the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>Unfortunately, all his plans were ruined by Qin Sang.</p><p>These new disciples were unaware of the inner workings and possessed low cultivation.  Qin Sang wasn't merciless enough to leave no one alive; those who hadn't committed evil acts could leave.</p><p>But the Kuiyin Sect remnants must die! These individuals who stood idly by while evil was committed in the Yin煞 Abyss were not innocent.</p><p>Only by completely eradicating them, preventing the Kuiyin Sect's resurgence, could Qin Sang avenge his losses and honor the memory of those killed by the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>Standing on a distant mountaintop, overlooking Dihuoshan, he saw a peculiar type of tree covering the volcano. Resembling maple trees with crimson leaves, they spread across the mountain, contrasting beautifully with the internal magma.  These trees were part of Moyanmen's protective formation. This formation, which employed the principle of wood generating fire within the five elements, and enhanced by the volcano's abundant fire energy, was exceptionally powerful.</p><p>Between the trees were huts and wooden houses, with occasional glimpses of figures moving below.  Behind Dihuoshan were several noticeably grand halls.</p><p>At the start, when Moyanmen was newly established and Jiupao Daoist hadn't expanded it greatly, the number of disciples was small. The remaining Kuiyin Sect members were few, further depleted by Qin Sang's hunts.  He estimated only a dozen or so remained, all Foundation Establishment cultivators, with considerable strength. The newly recruited disciples numbered only two hundred or so, with few at the Foundation Establishment stage, a fraction of the number at Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Currently, Dihuoshan presented a peaceful scene.  The Moyanmen disciples seemed unaware of the demise of their leader and envoys. Some young disciples were even listening to their instructors preach in the woods.</p><p>【Book Bonus】Follow the public account 【Book Friends' Camp】 to win cash/points every day!</p><p>"Could it be that the Crow Robe Daoist had made prior arrangements?"</p><p>Qin Sang considered it increasingly likely.  Before attempting body snatching, the Crow Robe Daoist must have made preparations; otherwise, they wouldn't be so unconcerned.</p><p>This made things much easier.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the Earth Volcano, then quietly circled it, arriving at a secluded valley behind the three peaks.  The valley was incredibly cold, a stark contrast to the Earth Volcano.</p><p>Deep within the valley, beside a muddy pool, was a dark cave emitting wisps of Yin煞 energy, sealed by a restriction.</p><p>Yin煞 energy, unlike Earth煞 energy, is not difficult to find. It often originates in places that consume living beings, such as charnel grounds or dark, cold locations.</p><p>The Kui Yin Sect's cultivation methods require Yin煞 energy. While this cave was small and contained far less Yin煞 energy than the Yin煞 Abyss, it was still sufficient to support the cultivation of the Kui Yin Sect remnants.</p><p>Qin Sang was aware of the remnants' strength.  Having obtained the method of breaking the restriction from a captured Flame Demon Envoy, he easily entered the cave, wielding his Ten Directions Yama Banner and Ebony Sword.</p><p>Inside, he found three cultivators: one at the late Foundation Establishment stage and two at the mid Foundation Establishment stage, each occupying their own space.</p><p>Qin Sang went straight for the late Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>The cave was pitch black.</p><p>Moving unseen within the Yin煞 energy, Qin Sang silently approached the cultivator, who was meditating on a black stone, surrounded by warning restrictions and a protective spirit array formed by several small flags.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, opened his palm, and silently released the Ten Directions Yama Array. A surge of raging ghost fire erupted.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A ripping sound echoed as the ghost fire instantly shattered the cultivator's protective array, scattering the flags, some broken, some torn.</p><p>The cultivator awoke with a start, his face paling. A dazzling sword light, accompanied by faint thunder, flashed before his eyes, swift as lightning. Before he could react, a sharp pain pierced his abdomen as the Ebony Sword passed through him, severely injuring his dantian.</p><p>Terrible sword energy rampaged through his energy sea, causing his spiritual energy to rapidly drain.</p><p>"Aaah…"</p><p>A dark shadow suddenly appeared behind him, seizing his neck and silencing his scream.</p><p>Qin Sang easily captured him, then, without concealing his actions, immediately attacked the other two.</p><p>"Who's there?"</p><p>"Brother Luo, what's wrong...?"</p><p>Although startled, the other two were far weaker. Qin Sang subdued them effortlessly without even using his Ebony Sword.</p><p>He captured all three without breaking a sweat.</p><p>As expected, they were all Kui Yin Sect remnants.</p>
