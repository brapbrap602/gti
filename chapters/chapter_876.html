<h1>Chapter 868: The Struggle</h1><p>But he keenly sensed an anomaly, realizing he wasn't entirely without a chance.</p><p>His opponents hadn't initially targeted him; their objective was the mysterious cultivators wielding lightning techniques.  Mid-pursuit, one of the black-robed figures recognized Qin Sang, abruptly shifting their focus to eliminate him first.</p><p>Consequently, their formation was unstable, leaving the others unable to provide immediate support.</p><p>In fact, just as Qin Sang suspected, the black-robed cultivators had stumbled upon the killer of their junior disciple and decided to eliminate him on the spot.</p><p>In their view, Qin Sang had expended considerable energy manipulating the Glacial Gale Formation to hunt demons, and was further weakened by the lightning strikes. They believed he was severely injured and at the end of his rope, making him an easy target for their fourth brother.</p><p>Compared to Qin Sang, the weakened disciples of the Candor Sect, who had just unleashed their lightning techniques, were more important and directly related to their mission.</p><p>It would be truly regrettable if, for the sake of one person, they allowed those Candor Sect disciples to escape and lose this golden opportunity.  Therefore, the others continued their pursuit of the Candor Sect disciples, only manipulating their Beast King Banners to assist their fourth brother.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly, having dispelled the baleful star's influence, returned to normal and, at Qin Sang's command, activated its Sky-Eye.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator waved his strange banner.</p><p>Roaring beast souls leaped from the banner's surface, charging towards Qin Sang.</p><p>A dazzling golden wall advanced with overwhelming force, accompanied by the furious roars of the beast souls, shaking the very heart.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave, yet his eyes held a hint of mockery.</p><p>While the aura of the strange banner formation appeared fearsome, it was transparent under the Sky-Eye. With their incomplete formation, the banner array was riddled with flaws, allowing Qin Sang to easily pinpoint a weak point.</p><p>Instead of slowing down, he accelerated, colliding head-on with the beast souls.</p><p>A smile spread across the fourth brother's face as Qin Sang seemingly threw himself into the jaws of the beast souls, but the smile quickly froze.</p><p>At the moment he was engulfed by the golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang, already anticipating this, abruptly halted, then shifted sideways several meters, effortlessly evading the beast souls' attack and passing between them.</p><p>Trapped within the Beast King Banner formation, Qin Sang's face remained calm and collected.</p><p>The beast souls lunged again.</p><p>Hidden within the golden light were fine, sharp golden threads connected to the beast souls.  Entanglement with these threads could, at best, immobilize an opponent, and at worst, sever limbs.</p><p>However, with the Sky-Eye Butterfly's assistance, Qin Sang not only grasped the beast souls' movements but also easily discerned the hidden threads.</p><p>A complete formation would indeed be formidable, but in its current state, it couldn't contain Qin Sang.</p><p>Surrounded by a spectral serpent, he weaved through the golden light, retreating several meters in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Not only did the pursuing beast souls miss their mark, but the ensnaring golden threads also fell short, easily dodged by Qin Sang, who remained unscathed.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator finally realized something was amiss.</p><p>His opponent seemed exceptionally proficient in formations, easily exploiting the weaknesses.</p><p>In a fit of rage and alarm, the black-robed cultivator frantically waved his Beast King Banner, but to no avail. He could only watch helplessly as Qin Sang closed in.  To his further fury, Qin Sang even took the initiative, attacking him with his spiritual sword.</p><p>The Ebony Sword sliced through the golden light with incredible speed.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator, enraged but still confident,  communicated with his fellow disciples, initiating a more potent variation of the formation.</p><p>The golden light intensified.</p><p>Beast souls self-detonated, transforming into golden energy that infused the threads.  Suddenly, a denser network of threads emerged, forming numerous nets.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator pointed at the Ebony Sword, and the golden nets lunged forward.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The Ebony Sword flickered repeatedly, shattering the golden nets.</p><p>Finally, one net managed to ensnare the Ebony Sword, but instead of being captured, the sword shattered into pieces.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the black-robed cultivator realized it was merely a sword beam.</p><p>“Sword Beam Splitting!”</p><p>Startled, the enraged cultivator continued his search, finally locating the true Ebony Sword.</p><p>Despite the missed attempts, they were still within the Beast King Banner formation.  Countless golden nets existed, and no matter how agile the Ebony Sword, it was eventually ensnared.</p><p>Just as the Ebony Sword was about to break free, it was caught, and more nets swarmed towards it.</p><p>“Once I seize your natal magic treasure, let's see how long you can struggle!”</p><p>The black-robed cultivator sneered, manipulating the formation to suppress the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Just then, a sinister blood-red light flashed past his eyes. Before he could react, it struck one of the Beast King Banners.</p><p>A single Beast King Banner wasn't inherently a high-grade treasure.  Struck by the Profane Blood Light, its spiritual light instantly vanished, followed by a cracking sound as it snapped in two.</p><p>The Beast King Banner was destroyed!</p><p>The black-robed cultivator stared in disbelief, still trying to comprehend what had happened.</p><p>Within the formation, all Beast King Banners were interconnected. Damage to one affected the entire array. From Qin Sang's perspective, this meant even more vulnerabilities.</p><p>A large section of the golden net vanished, providing Qin Sang with an unobstructed path. He rapidly charged towards the edge of the formation, closing the distance between himself and the black-robed cultivator.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator frantically attempted to repair the formation, but realizing he was out of time, he made a decisive choice, preparing to summon his own magic treasure and confront Qin Sang directly.</p><p>But Qin Sang wouldn't give him the chance.</p><p>The moment his identity was exposed, Qin Sang's mind raced, devising an escape plan.</p><p>Even without resorting to the Profane Blood Light, breaking the formation wasn't particularly difficult, but doing so would lead to entanglement with the black-robed cultivator and subsequent attacks from the others.</p><p>Therefore, he had to eliminate this obstacle with utmost speed and then escape.  To achieve this, Qin Sang spared no effort.  After unleashing the Profane Blood Light, he unhesitatingly deployed the Star Conch, a treasure he rarely used.</p><p>A sharp whistling sound pierced the air.</p><p>A sense of inexplicable dread filled the black-robed cultivator as a dazzling blue light appeared in his vision.  Almost without any resistance, he was pierced by the Star Conch.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>A transparent hole appeared in the black-robed cultivator's chest, followed by a gush of blood. His body froze mid-air, eyes wide with disbelief.</p><p>He had leveraged the power of the formation to avenge his junior disciple by slaying a weakened foe.</p><p>Yet, vengeance unfulfilled, he had lost his own life.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>The black-robed cultivator's corpse plunged into the sea.</p><p>After claiming its victim, the Star Conch returned to Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>Qin Sang darted out of the formation, retrieving the Star Conch. He beckoned the black-robed cultivator's body towards him.  A closer look confirmed his suspicions – the man was indeed of the Wu Clan. After taking the cultivator's belongings, Qin Sang was about to seize the several Beast King Banners the cultivator controlled, when a furious roar echoed from the distance.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator's companions had noticed.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, ignoring them.  He unleashed a surge of true essence, enveloping the Beast King Banners and pulling them back. Unexpectedly, a strong resistance emanated from the banners.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Qin Sang realized that the others were using the connection between the banners to contend with him.</p><p>There was no reason to relinquish treasure already within his grasp.</p><p>After a brief moment of thought, Qin Sang activated the Ten Yama Banners, summoning demonic flames to engulf the Beast King Banners.</p>
