<h1>Chapter 796: Star Conch</h1><p>Body-cultivating cultivators are very rare, and those as strong as the hooked-nosed man are even rarer. Most of the body cultivators Qin Sang had seen before had low cultivation levels. They attempted to forge a different path, but top-tier body cultivation techniques were even harder to find, and the difficulty of cultivation was extremely high, resulting in mediocrity in all aspects, a waste of time.</p><p>Qin Sang occasionally turned to observe the man, discovering that he hadn't used any magical treasures from beginning to end, suggesting he might be a pure body cultivator.</p><p>With each flap, the wings turned into a flash of azure light, exploding with astonishing speed, a perfect match for the hooked-nosed man's powerful physique.</p><p>As a result, not only could Qin Sang not shake him off, but the distance between them was closing.</p><p>The hooked-nosed man was determined to kill Qin Sang, relentlessly pursuing him.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't continue like this. The opponent showed no signs of exhaustion, and it was almost impossible to escape. He would soon be caught and had to think of a way to get away.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang glanced around and suddenly changed direction, heading towards the area where the hurricane force was most concentrated.</p><p>Countless extremely dense gray streaks of air floated there. These tangible hurricanes were terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>Due to the density of the hurricanes, the space for them to maneuver was narrow.</p><p>Only in such a chaotic place did Qin Sang have a chance.</p><p>The hooked-nosed man saw through Qin Sang's intentions at a glance, but he showed no fear, unhesitatingly changing direction and continuing his pursuit.</p><p>As one chased and the other fled, the distance between them grew shorter and shorter.</p><p>Qin Sang could almost feel the hooked-nosed man's gaze, sharp as a blade, on his back. The opponent's arrogance and recklessness fueled Qin Sang's determination. A fierce glint flashed in his eyes as he abruptly stopped and turned, glaring back.</p><p>In the next moment, a bolt of lightning shot out from between his eyebrows.</p><p>The lightning arrived first, followed by the faint rumble of thunder.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword appeared, exhibiting astonishing power as it flew straight towards the hooked-nosed man.</p><p>He only saw the flying sword rapidly enlarge in his vision, then it strangely split into three, two solid and one slightly illusory, before merging back into one with even greater power.</p><p>A strange look flashed in the hooked-nosed man's eyes. Then, he abruptly folded his wings, and a dazzling azure light surged from within him, making his wings even more radiant.</p><p>His body twisted slightly as his fists vanished, merging into the wings. Facing the Ebony Wood Sword, he didn't dodge or evade, but fiercely flapped his wings, striking the sword head-on.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Sword Qi and azure light collided, causing an explosion.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword flew back.</p><p>The hooked-nosed man's wings dimmed slightly. He retracted his fists, flexed his fingers, his momentum checked by the Ebony Wood Sword.</p><p>This strike failed to injure the hooked-nosed man in the slightest, but it did interrupt his advance.</p><p>This sword technique, Combined Sword Light, was something Qin Sang had learned from the swordsman in the sword path. He wasn't proficient yet, but he was satisfied with the power of his first attempt.</p><p>The hooked-nosed man looked Qin Sang up and down with interest, a bloodthirsty smile suddenly appearing on his face. “Your movement and sword techniques are quite rare among humans, aren't they?  In all these years, you're the first I've encountered. It seems I'll be personally extinguishing a human genius today!”</p><p>His voice was sharp and somewhat grating.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised by his words.</p><p>A faint demonic aura emanated from the man, indicating he had consumed a Demonic Pill during his Core Formation. He was clearly not a Wu tribesman. He was human, yet spoke such strange words.</p><p>Qin Sang said nothing, controlling his sword to attack again.</p><p>The hooked-nosed man, seemingly having made a casual jest, his expression turned serious as he once again met the attack with his fists.</p><p>Qin Sang fought and retreated.</p><p>The hooked-nosed man was too strong. Using only his fists and wings, he easily countered the Ebony Wood Sword, making it impossible for Qin Sang to block his attacks. Qin Sang retreated steadily, soon showing signs of defeat.</p><p>Forced to act, Qin Sang secretly summoned the Ten Yama Banners. With a wave of his hand, the banners spun rapidly, and a streak of Nine Nether Demonic Fire shot out, aimed at his opponent's face.</p><p>Sensing the aura of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the hooked-nosed man's expression shifted slightly. He flapped his wings abruptly, instantly shifting dozens of yards, staring at the demonic fire with a mixture of surprise and uncertainty.</p><p>The demonic fire missed. Seeing this, Qin Sang’s heart stirred.</p><p>The hooked-nosed man must have misunderstood something. Although the Nine Nether Demonic Fire only possessed a fraction of its original power, it was still intimidating enough. For someone unfamiliar with it, like the hooked-nosed man, such a reaction was normal.</p><p>But after engaging with the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, its power would be easily understood. However, the hooked-nosed man, relying solely on his fists, dared not rashly touch the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>As long as the true nature of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire wasn't revealed, Qin Sang could hold out for a while.</p><p>He immediately urged both the Ebony Wood Sword and the demonic fire to attack.</p><p>At first, the hooked-nosed man was hesitant, but he soon realized something was amiss.  He used his wings to probe, finally confirming that the demonic fire wasn't as terrifying as he'd imagined, his expression turning somewhat embarrassed and angry.</p><p>Through this exchange of blows, Qin Sang had successfully escaped into the depths of the storm.</p><p>Although the hooked-nosed man wasn't afraid of the waves, he had to avoid the hurricanes formed by the power of heaven and earth, not daring to be swept into them.</p><p>This way, with the interference of the hurricanes, even though the hooked-nosed man was clearly stronger, quickly killing Qin Sang wouldn't be easy.</p><p>The two fought within the gaps of the hurricane.</p><p>After being seen through by the hooked-nosed man, Qin Sang's situation became increasingly difficult, his defeat evident.</p><p>The hooked-nosed man, his momentum like a rainbow, sent the Ebony Wood Sword flying with a punch. Then, with a resonant cry from his inner organs, he flapped his wings, and a flash of azure light slammed into the Nine Nether Demonic Fire. With a 'boom,' it completely scattered the demonic fire.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly. Just as he was about to summon the Ten Yama Banners to condense new demonic fire, a sudden sense of danger arose in his heart. From the corner of his eye, he saw a point of blue light shoot out from the azure flash after it broke through the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, heading straight for him.</p><p>“A magical treasure! This man was hiding his true abilities!”</p><p>The blue light was incredibly fast. Only the size of a fist, lacking any awe-inspiring aura, it nevertheless made Qin Sang's hair stand on end.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly threw out the Golden Yao Lock, then flicked his wrist, sending out the Twin-Headed Serpent Ring.</p><p>He had originally intended to keep the Twin-Headed Serpent hidden, but upon seeing the blue light, he unhesitatingly released it.</p><p>An astonishing scene unfolded.  After being struck by the blue light, the Golden Yao Lock only held for a moment before emitting a mournful cry.  The golden light trembled violently, and the Golden Yao Lock shattered inch by inch, turning into dust.</p><p>A genuine mid-grade magical treasure was so easily destroyed before Qin Sang’s eyes.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang finally saw the true form of the blue light: it was a blue conch shell.</p><p>The shell itself was jade white, but it was dotted with blue specks, like beautiful stars. The intense blue light emanated from these specks.</p><p>This Star Conch spun rapidly, its tip pointed at Qin Sang.  Seemingly naturally formed, it displayed astonishing destructive power.  After destroying the Golden Yao Lock, it continued its advance.</p>
