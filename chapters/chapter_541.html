<h1>Chapter 534:  A Role Model</h1><p>Chapter 534:  A Role Model</p><p>Qin Sang burst into laughter.</p><p>He’d sensed something earlier, and a bold test confirmed his suspicions.  His true essence, perhaps containing the essence of the Azure Yang Divine Gang, shared a source with the Azure Yang Demon Fire, making him immune to it.  Even if touched, he could easily shake it off.</p><p>The most feared tactic of the Azure Yang Demon Sect cultivators was useless against him.  To Qin Sang, the Azure Yang Demon Fire was no different from ordinary spirit fire.</p><p>This meant Qin Sang could recklessly break through formations, and in his upcoming battle with Wu Youdao, he wouldn't be as constrained, having a much greater chance of escape.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the true essence within the Corpse Pill.  Although his fight with Wu Youdao hadn't lasted long, his consumption was rapid. He couldn’t recover during battle and needed to escape before his true essence was exhausted.  Until then, he couldn't show any weakness, lest Wu Youdao notice anything.</p><p>Qin Sang broke free from the flames.</p><p>Including Wu Youdao, everyone was shocked by this scene.  The Azure Fire Flag Formation, one of the strongest techniques of Azure Yang Demon Sect cultivators using the Azure Yang Demon Fire, was supposed to at least stall Qin Sang.  They expected it to buy Wu Youdao time to catch up, yet it proved utterly ineffective.</p><p>They attributed it to Qin Sang’s strange true essence, mistakenly believing he possessed some fire-resistant treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze swept across the scene.</p><p>Suddenly, he flicked a finger, and the Wumou Sword's energy surged, transforming into a streak of light and slashing out.</p><p>They immediately realized Qin Sang was trying to destroy the three Azure Flags.</p><p>"Condense!"</p><p>The three cultivators manipulating the flags remained calm under pressure.</p><p>The three Azure Flags suddenly converged, the flames on their surfaces rising to form a fiery barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang’s attack on the flags, rather than fleeing, played right into their hands.  The Azure Yang Demon Fire condensed by the Azure Fire Flag Formation, while unable to burn Qin Sang’s true essence, still possessed considerable power and wasn’t easily destroyed.  They only needed to stall for a moment, and Master Wu would arrive.</p><p>But unexpectedly, the Wumou Sword ignored the flags, brushing past the formation, flashing repeatedly, and heading straight for the flying vessel above them.</p><p>"No! The vessel!"</p><p>A cultivator with the surname Li reacted immediately, letting out a cry of alarm.</p><p>They had only just arrived, hearing Wu Youdao’s order to deploy the Azure Fire Flag Formation, and hadn’t had time to recall the vessel.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Wumou Sword's light, thousands of feet long, like a rainbow piercing the sun, struck the vessel's midsection.</p><p>A tremendous sound echoed out.  The flying vessel was violently repelled tens of yards, its spiritual light dimming significantly.  A shocking fissure, visible to the naked eye, appeared on the vessel's port side, almost splitting the artifact in two.</p><p>Then, the vessel tilted and plummeted from the sky!</p><p>After weighing his options, Qin Sang decided to destroy the vessel first.</p><p>Destroying the three Azure Flags wouldn’t solve the problem; who knew how many others in the Azure Yang Demon Sect possessed similar flags?</p><p>But this type of flying vessel, which could be manipulated by Foundation Establishment cultivators yet possessed the speed comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator's escape, was a very special artifact, extremely difficult to refine and requiring precious materials not unlike those for magical treasures.</p><p>Shaohua Mountain didn't possess such an artifact, and the Azure Yang Demon Sect probably couldn't find a second one either.</p><p>Destroying the vessel would prevent the Foundation Establishment disciples from pursuing him. Once he created distance, he would only need to face Wu Youdao; otherwise, Wu Youdao would have endless reinforcements.</p><p>The Wumou Sword's strike had been successful.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare linger, as Wu Youdao was still hot on his heels.</p><p>Wu Youdao wouldn't fall for a feint again, unless Qin Sang was willing to detonate the Xuantian Thunder. In such an open area, the thunder would probably only tear through Wu Youdao's clothes.</p><p>Maintaining his speed, Qin Sang suddenly dived towards the ground, forcefully breaking through the ranks of the Azure Yang Demon Sect disciples to retrieve his pouch.</p><p>The target was easy to choose, as Qin Sang spotted a familiar face.</p><p>Wen Yanjie!</p><p>This guy, carrying a coffin, was too conspicuous.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated barely at all, focusing on Wen Yanjie, flashing through the air, instantly facing him.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang's current appearance was too grotesque for Wen Yanjie to recognize him.</p><p>Among his fellow disciples, Wen Yanjie's cultivation ranked among the top five, but he was exceptionally low-key.</p><p>They were facing a Nascent Soul expert capable of exchanging blows with Wu Youdao.  If they hadn't feared disobeying Wu Youdao's orders, they would have scattered long ago.</p><p>The more prominent one was, the quicker one died.</p><p>Wen Yanjie understood this very well.</p><p>He’d assumed Master Wu would easily subdue their opponent.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the situation changed rapidly. In the blink of an eye, the man easily evaded Wu Youdao and charged towards them, leaving them no chance to escape.</p><p>Furthermore, out of so many people, he chose *him*!</p><p>At that moment, Wen Yanjie realized how vulnerable he was.</p><p>Terror etched across Wen Yanjie's face.  The black coffin behind him exploded with a loud "boom," and a dark figure darted before him.</p><p>Seeing Wen Yanjie attempting to use the corpse he had sold him to stop him,</p><p>Qin Sang sneered inwardly.  His right hand formed a claw, moving even faster, directly seizing the corpse's abdomen, piercing its dantian.  His true energy surged forth, instantly destroying the corpse's energy sea.</p><p>In an instant, they crossed paths, and the corpse shattered into pieces.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang effortlessly knocked away Wen Yanjie's magical artifact, grabbed his neck, his gaze cold as he surveyed the surroundings.  His other hand suddenly rose, and he struck Wen Yanjie's forehead with a palm strike.</p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>Wen Yanjie's head exploded like a watermelon, without a single groan, instantly killing him.</p><p>White and red splattered everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang casually tossed the remains aside, coldly stating, "Anyone who dares to obstruct me will meet the same fate!"</p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivators, including the Golden Core cultivator from the Li family, were all aghast, gasping in shock and instinctively taking a step back.</p><p>The Green Fire Banner Formation had given them the illusion that they could interfere in the fight between Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Only now did they realize that with just three green banners, they at most had the qualification to provide flanking support.  If Wu Youdao couldn't suppress his opponent, and the opponent went on a rampage, the Green Fire Banner Formation wouldn't be able to save their lives.</p><p>No one dared to obstruct Qin Sang anymore. He smoothly charged into the forest below, striking the ground with a palm, creating a deep furrow. Then, his true energy enveloped his pouch of holding and other treasures, which sprang forth from the ground.</p><p>After securing these treasures, Qin Sang's expression relaxed. He glanced back before continuing his escape.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivators remained frozen in place, staring at each other, afraid to pursue.</p><p>Wu Youdao still hadn't given up, transforming into a streak of light, relentlessly chasing Qin Sang. Two streaks of light, one after the other, quickly disappeared from everyone's sight.</p><p>Knowing his disciples couldn't help in the short term, he left a message:</p><p>"Li Qing, return to the mountain immediately and investigate the core forbidden area to see what this person stole! Repair the flying boat as soon as possible, and gather all disciples possessing green banners to assist me."</p>
