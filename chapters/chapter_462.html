<h1>Chapter 455: White Flame Ji Wu</h1><p>An hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled awake from his meditation. His token was glowing again!</p><p>Stargazing Island was summoning him!</p><p>“So soon? What happened again?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, his mind racing, but his movements didn't pause. He hurriedly gathered his belongings, pushed the door open, and discovered that this time was different from last night.</p><p>Mu Yifeng and the others hadn't appeared, and everything else on the island seemed normal.</p><p>This meant Stargazing Island was summoning only him.</p><p>He looked left and right, observing for a moment.  Still, all was calm, and he couldn't help but feel apprehensive.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare delay. He summoned his Ethereal Cloud and flew alone toward Stargazing Island.</p><p>As he neared Stargazing Island, he noticed a familiar streak of rainbow light shooting through the sky. Judging by its trajectory, it was also heading toward Stargazing Island.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart leaped with joy. He quickly slowed down, waiting for the rainbow light to catch up.</p><p>The rainbow light evidently noticed Qin Sang as well and veered toward him.  It turned out to be Senior Brother Rong.</p><p>“Senior Brother Rong…”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly and asked in a low voice, “Did you also receive the summons from Stargazing Island?”</p><p>Senior Brother Rong nodded. “Indeed!  It seems Junior Brother Qin did as well. That puts my mind at ease. I was worried I was the only one and was trying to recall if I had unknowingly committed some error and was about to be punished.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and smiled. “To be honest, Senior Brother, I had the same thought just now…”</p><p>“I wonder if it's Martial Uncle Che summoning us…”</p><p>The two continued their journey while talking. Soon, they saw Stargazing Island and discovered that they weren't the only ones. Several other streaks of light were also converging on the island, belonging to both righteous and demonic cultivators.</p><p>Stargazing Island was formed from dozens of smaller islands artificially joined together, yet it appeared as a seamless whole.  The ground was as smooth as a mirror, reflecting light perfectly. Several grand halls were neatly arranged on the island, though Qin Sang had only entered the outermost one.</p><p>Landing on Stargazing Island, he realized that more than twenty people had arrived before them. They were standing in front of the main hall, scattered in small groups.</p><p>A quick glance revealed all familiar faces.</p><p>Without exception, these were all renowned figures who had distinguished themselves during the standoff between the Minor Cold Domain and the Heavenly March Alliance. The vast majority were Core Formation realm experts.</p><p>Only a few, like Qin Sang, hadn't reached the Core Formation realm but had still made a name for themselves.</p><p>Seeing these people, Qin Sang had a vague understanding of the situation.</p><p>Noticing the arrival of Qin Sang and Senior Brother Rong, everyone's gaze turned towards them. Some were wary, some harbored hidden hostility, and some showed goodwill.</p><p>A man in white strode toward them, bowed slightly, and said with a smile, “I knew I wouldn't miss seeing the two of you here.”</p><p>This person was from the Grand Unity Elixir Sect, named Shang Yi.</p><p>His renowned magical artifact was an alchemical cauldron. Qin Sang didn't know if he could refine pills, but he knew he could definitely refine people. Numerous Heavenly March Alliance cultivators had been devoured by his cauldron, leaving no trace behind.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Shang…”</p><p>Qin Sang and Senior Brother Rong returned the greeting.</p><p>Senior Brother Rong looked around and asked suspiciously, “Is Fellow Daoist Shang the only one from your sect who received the summons?”</p><p>Shang Yi discreetly gestured behind him. “Look at those people back there. Do you see any ordinary figures?  Each one is a veteran of the battlefield.  Our sect is lucky to have even one like me who can barely keep up. We don't have anyone who can compare to the renowned Shadowless Sword.”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Shang is teasing me again.”</p><p>Qin Sang was also familiar with Shang Yi. He shook his head and chuckled, retorting, “Leaving aside everything else, I witnessed Fellow Daoist Wandering Scholar's strength with my own eyes and was utterly impressed. I've asked you several times, but I haven't gotten any news.  Your Grand Unity Elixir Sect is hiding so many experts. Are you afraid it will affect their Core Formation?”</p><p>“Likewise! Likewise!”</p><p>Shang Yi laughed heartily.</p><p>“Senior Brother Wandering Scholar established his foundation at the age of one hundred and then broke through to the Core Formation realm at an astonishing speed. With such talent and willpower, who in the entire Minor Cold Domain dares to compare with him?</p><p>“I’ve asked for you several times, but Senior Brother Wandering Scholar has gone somewhere and hasn’t shown up. If I have any news, I’ll tell you immediately.</p><p>“Besides, Senior Brother Wandering Scholar’s direct disciple, Li Yufu, is in your squad. If he were to return, how could he not care for his disciple?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.</p><p>Not long after the True Water Illusion Formation was set up, Li Yufu was also summoned to the Chaotic Islands waters. Qin Sang had overstepped his authority, found a reason, and transferred Li Yufu to his squad so he could look after him for Wandering Scholar.</p><p>Because he acted cautiously, his squad suffered few losses, and Li Yufu remained unharmed, making considerable progress over these three years.</p><p>What made Qin Sang uneasy was that several years had passed since Li Yufu went to Azure Sun Market City to relay the message that Wandering Scholar was searching for heavenly materials and earthly treasures. There had been no news since.</p><p>Even during this great war, Wandering Scholar was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Wandering Scholar's master had passed away long ago.  In fact, like himself, he had no strong backing in the sect. Qin Sang wondered what method he used to avoid being summoned by Stargazing Island.</p><p>The three of them talked for a while longer as several more streaks of light landed one after another.</p><p>Just then, a sharp shriek came from the east. A surge of demonic energy swept over, circled above Stargazing Island, and landed in an unoccupied spot.</p><p>As the demonic energy dissipated, a pale face was revealed, seemingly belonging to a young man in his twenties.</p><p>However, his cultivation was undeniably at the Core Formation realm!</p><p>The instant this person landed, Qin Sang's eyes flickered, but his expression remained unchanged as he continued to chat and laugh with Shang Yi.</p><p>At this moment, a senior sister from the Supreme Purity Palace approached.</p><p>As Qin Sang turned slightly, his gaze inconspicuously glanced at the pale young man.</p><p>The pale young man's name was Ji Wu.</p><p>Ji Wu was his real name, but he had another identity: White Flame, one of the four Demon Flame Envoys of the Demonic Flame Sect!</p><p>He was Dove Robe Daoist's newly accepted last disciple!</p><p>This person was less than a hundred years old, and his cultivation time was likely shorter than anyone present. Yet, not only had he broken through to the Core Formation realm, but his mastery of demonic fire was extraordinary. It was said that its power wasn't much inferior to the Azure Sun Demonic Fire of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang paid close attention to him and also knew that he undoubtedly possessed powerful magical artifacts and talismans!</p><p>This couldn't simply be explained by talent.</p><p>It was clear that Dove Robe Daoist had invested a great deal of effort in this person!</p><p>Unlike the remnants of the Yin Corpse Sect, Ji Wu's identity was clean. The Yuan Zhao Sect didn't know about his relationship with Dove Robe Daoist.</p><p>Unafraid of being pursued by the Yuan Zhao Sect, he acted quite ostentatiously and had gained considerable fame in Azure Sun City.  It had only been less than two years since he was transferred from Azure Sun City to the Chaotic Islands waters, but his reputation already rivaled that of Senior Brother Rong and the others.</p><p>Qin Sang, of course, knew Ji Wu's true identity and had secretly discovered that Ji Wu had been collecting various high-quality healing pills, clearly for Dove Robe Daoist.</p><p>He had been plotting to capture Ji Wu, but although Ji Wu acted boldly, he was actually very cautious.</p><p>Moreover, his cultivation was truly remarkable, having inherited the true teachings of Dove Robe Daoist. Qin Sang had never found an opportunity.</p>
