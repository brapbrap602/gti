<h1>Chapter 817: The Uninvited Guest</h1><p>For a while now, Qin Sang had racked his brains trying to lure Luo Daotong off the island.</p><p>But this was the heart of the territory controlled by both righteous and demonic sects, and Qin Sang couldn't act recklessly. Too much commotion might attract experts from other islands.</p><p>He considered many plans, but abandoned them all.</p><p>If he could use the Skyeye Butterfly to find a weakness in the island's protective formation, he wouldn't have to wait any longer.</p><p>Qin Sang flew his sword out of Nandao Island, heading straight for Liangqiu Island. Halfway there, he lowered his flying speed and activated the Spirit Concealment Technique to hide his presence.</p><p>Soon, Liangqiu Island came into view.</p><p>The island wasn't large, but it possessed a rich spiritual aura, hiding a top-grade spiritual vein.</p><p>Precisely because of this, Luo Daotong had enveloped almost the entire island within a protective formation. From the outside, one could only vaguely see a mountain silhouette on the island.</p><p>It was still dark, the darkest hour before dawn.</p><p>The island's formation shimmered with strange light, sparkling brightly, as if echoing the stars in the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang watched from afar for a while, then continued to approach stealthily.  He didn't dare to be so arrogant as to land directly on the island, stopping on the sea surface nearby.</p><p>He held his breath, bobbing up and down with the waves, floating motionless on the water. Then, he released the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>The butterfly landed on his shoulder, spread its wings, and its skyeye focused on Liangqiu Island.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind connected with the butterfly, and the 'view' slowly changed.</p><p>His vision pierced through layers of strange light, finally revealing the outline of the mountain peak.</p><p>A solitary, exceptionally steep peak stood tall.</p><p>A white line cascaded down the mountain, likely a waterfall.</p><p>Due to the distance, the view wasn't very clear, and he hadn't yet located Luo Daotong's cave. Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry. He withdrew his gaze and focused on the strange lights.</p><p>The strange lights were the manifestation of the protective formation. Not only did they serve as a visual barrier, they also possessed considerable power.</p><p>Within each ray of light, countless runes were contained.</p><p>An hour later, as dawn approached, Qin Sang rubbed his forehead, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>“This is a formation I've never seen before. It's very powerful. I think I saw a few weak points, but I need to confirm them. However, to assassinate Luo Daotong, simply finding a weakness and breaking through the formation isn't enough. I need to be fast enough that Luo Daotong can't react. It has to be quick and decisive. This is extremely difficult.  Fully deciphering this protective formation is not something that can be accomplished overnight.”</p><p>Qin Sang memorized the runes he saw, preparing to return and slowly analyze them. He quietly withdrew.</p><p>Back in his cave, Qin Sang went into seclusion to study the runes.</p><p>Luo Daotong was indeed formidable. The protective formation was extremely complex. Qin Sang knew he couldn't create such a formation himself; there must be an expert guiding Luo Daotong.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang discovered that the island's protective formation wasn't singular. Several formations were nested within each other, making it incredibly secure.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the Skyeye Butterfly. Otherwise, it would be impossible to understand the connections between these formations, and he would have been trapped upon entering the island.</p><p>“It's too complicated.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed and patiently studied the function of the runes, searching for patterns. Every few days, he would return to observe the formation and verify his understanding.</p><p>If he could touch the formation and experience it firsthand, his progress would be much faster. Because he didn't dare to land on the island, he couldn't see the complete formation, so progress was slow.  Furthermore, his requirements were high.</p><p>It took nearly a month for him to grasp some of the patterns.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as he was rejoicing, an unforeseen event occurred, without any warning.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang, exhausted from days of studying the formation, took a break and was training outside when a pillar of light suddenly erupted from the sea.</p><p>Startled by the change, Qin Sang opened his eyes and was surprised to discover that the pillar of light originated from the direction of Liangqiu Island.</p><p>He flashed to the mountain peak and looked towards the island.</p><p>By then, the pillar of light had vanished as quickly as it had appeared.</p><p>But then, strange lights reappeared in that direction.</p><p>Clearly visible in the night sky, countless strange lights erupted, illuminating almost half the sky. Like flames composed of various colors, they danced wildly in the night.</p><p>These lights fluctuated, sometimes flaring up, sometimes disappearing.</p><p>At the same time, waves surged from that direction.</p><p>Confused, Qin Sang immediately flew his sword towards the source of the light without hesitation.</p><p>Soon, he saw the origin of the strange lights.</p><p>“That's Liangqiu Island! Someone is attacking the island! How is this possible? Besides me, someone else is also targeting Liangqiu Island? Why was there no sign of this? I've been making acquaintances with nearby cultivators, yet I haven't detected anything unusual!”</p><p>Qin Sang was bewildered, completely clueless about what was happening.</p><p>He was close to understanding the patterns of the island's formation and would have been able to act soon, but a mysterious person had unexpectedly intervened.</p><p>This was a situation Qin Sang hadn't anticipated.</p><p>The identity of the mysterious person was a mystery, their attack completely unheralded.</p><p>This person dared to directly attack the island, shaking its formations and causing such a commotion without fear.</p><p>The strange lights were the manifestation of the protective formation. Initially, they appeared as a pillar of light, and continued to illuminate half the sky, but their intensity gradually weakened. This clearly indicated that the attacker was either very powerful or extremely proficient in formation manipulation.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, realizing that regardless of their motives, if the mysterious person could test Luo Daotong's strength, it might not be a bad thing.</p><p>But he didn't want to leave just like that. There might be an opportunity to take advantage of the chaos.</p><p>However, he had to be mindful of time.</p><p>The mysterious person probably didn't know that Luo Daotong had a Nascent Soul ancestor backing him. The commotion caused by the attack was too great and was bound to alert others. Reinforcements would arrive soon.</p><p>Before that, if he could capture Luo Daotong in the chaos, he could blame it on this person. Even if he didn't have a chance to act, he could use this opportunity to see which island lord was behind Luo Daotong.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. He immediately concealed his aura and rushed over to observe the battle.</p><p>On the way, Qin Sang kept an eye on the battlefield. He noticed that although the strange lights were diminishing, they were very persistent and refused to be extinguished, meaning Luo Daotong was withstanding the attacker's assault.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but scoff inwardly. If this person couldn't even break the protective formation, what was the point of attacking the island? What a reckless fool!</p><p>Before long, Liangqiu Island was in sight.</p><p>From afar, he could see the eruption of strange lights enveloping the entire island. Both sides were engaged in fierce combat. Roars frequently echoed from within, the shockwaves from the clashes causing massive waves around the island, a scene of utter chaos.</p><p>With the naked eye, it was impossible to discern the current situation.</p><p>Qin Sang had never met Luo Daotong and wasn't sure if the roars were coming from him.</p><p>"It seems the battle is intense. This person will have a hard time killing Luo Daotong. So reckless! If I had discovered this person earlier, I wouldn't have wasted so much time."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly and moved closer, releasing the Skyeye Butterfly to secretly observe the situation.</p><p>The butterfly's vision penetrated the strange lights, but the scene it revealed was utterly unexpected.</p><p>There were three people on the island, but only one was attacking the formation!</p>
