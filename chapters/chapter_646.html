<h1>Chapter 638: Subjugation</h1><p>The crowd was clearly tempted.</p><p>The alluring woman ceased her charm, her expression turning serious. "From today onward, the Five Venom Sect will hand over Blackwind Valley and, for the next two hundred years, will not set foot within its boundaries. In return, we will withdraw immediately."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi hadn't expected such an exorbitant demand.  He flew into a rage, his wooden staff striking the ground. "Two hundred years without access to Blackwind Valley? What will be left of the Five Venom Sect by then? You intend to destroy our foundation!"</p><p>The alluring woman was equally unyielding, retorting sharply, "Your Five Venom Sect occupies Blackwind Valley's spirit stone mine and Venom Spring. Have you considered how the cultivators of our two territories have fared?  Blame your own disciples for their incompetence. They've occupied such valuable resources yet haven't made any progress!  We'll give you two choices: either stay away from Blackwind Valley for two hundred years or hand over the spirit stones and Venom Spring yield of the past century."</p><p>The Thunder Ghost Elder spoke, "Old Cui Xuan, I'll give you the time it takes for an incense stick to burn to consider. After that, I'd like to test the strength of the Five Venom Sect's protective formation."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi's face turned ashen.</p><p>Though he had the talisman treasure gifted by Qin Sang, facing so many experts, defeat was inevitable. No matter how strong the protective formation, how long could it last without reinforcements?</p><p>Returning to the main hall, Cui Xuanzi gritted his teeth, pushed open the door, and knelt before Qin Sang, pleading loudly, "Senior, please save me!"</p><p>Qin Sang had overheard the arguments at the gate. He also believed the Five Venom Sect's Golden Core cultivator had likely perished outside.  In a place like the Western Frontier, one Golden Core cultivator could ensure a sect's prosperity for three to five centuries. The fact that the previous cultivator had consolidated surrounding territories and seized the seemingly resource-rich Blackwind Valley before leaving suggested they weren't entirely heartless. Even for a solitary cultivator, returning within such a timeframe wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang held his teacup, his gaze sharp as a knife, staring at Cui Xuanzi without speaking.</p><p>The atmosphere in the hall suddenly froze. Cui Xuanzi felt an oppressive pressure descend upon him, causing him to tremble with fear, cold sweat dripping from his forehead.</p><p>"You invited me into your sect, just for this moment?"</p><p>Qin Sang's voice was icy, laced with killing intent.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi's expression changed drastically, and he hastily defended himself. "Junior knew they had ill intentions. I also hoped to befriend Senior, to deter them. But I wouldn't dare scheme against Senior even if I had a hundred lives!  I truly didn't know they would attack today!"</p><p>"Junior has served Senior diligently, without the slightest negligence. Senior's discerning eyes can surely see this.  Initially, Junior planned to ask for Senior's protection for the Five Venom Sect, without any reward. But before Junior could speak, they arrived. Please, Senior, understand!"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi prostrated himself on the ground, not even daring to wipe away his sweat, appearing utterly subservient.</p><p>He didn't seem to be feigning.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang didn't relent, snorting coldly. "You dare claim to have served me diligently? When I asked you about the secrets around the Bear Mountain region, why did you conceal Blackwind Valley and the Venom Spring?"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was taken aback, crying out his innocence. "Senior misunderstands. Blackwind Valley is not a secret realm, merely containing a spirit stone mine. Its location between our three factions has led to this conflict.  The Venom Spring also holds no other special properties. Its water can nourish venomous spirit insects, enhancing their toxins during their first transformation and accelerating their cultivation.  It has no effect on other spirit insects, and even for venomous insects, the benefits diminish after the second transformation."</p><p>Qin Sang, of course, knew what the Venom Spring was.</p><p>The Spirit Beast Sect's records mentioned this kind of naturally occurring venomous area.  Its water was inherently poisonous, beneficial for raising venomous insects, but not for their transformations. Venom Springs varied in quality, and this one, effective only for the first transformation, was the lowest grade. Any of the insect cultivation methods Qin Sang knew were more efficient than the Venom Spring.</p><p>However, for both the Five Venom Sect and the other two factions, whose members were mostly Qi Refinement cultivators with only a few Foundation Establishment cultivators, the Venom Spring's ability to boost their primary insect gu's power explained its importance to them.</p><p>"Senior, if you don't believe me, you can visit Blackwind Valley yourself after this matter is settled."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi kowtowed again. "Senior, please, considering my diligent service, help me this once.  Junior is willing to lead the entire Five Venom Sect to serve under Senior's command!"</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed inwardly. He was a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  The Western Frontier was a barren land, and he wouldn't stay long. Becoming a patron of the Five Venom Sect would lower his status.</p><p>However, on second thought, it might not be entirely useless.</p><p>Over the past month, Qin Sang had searched half of the Bear Mountain region, even exploring the underground rivers, but still hadn't found the ancient teleportation formation.  If he couldn't find it, having some local factions gather information for him before he left wouldn't be a bad option. Cui Xuanzi was clever and, if truly devoted, could be of assistance.  Besides, Ya Gu was still cultivating at the Five Venom Sect.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang hadn't outright refused, seemingly in contemplation, Cui Xuanzi was overjoyed, quickly swearing oaths and offering spirit stones and treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang was swayed, but knew he couldn't stay here to supervise. It was best not to let Cui Xuanzi gain absolute power. Subduing the outside forces as well, creating a balance of power, would ensure stability and their full dedication to his task. He wasn't interested in their resources; the spirit stone mine and Venom Spring held no appeal for him. If these factions caused him trouble, he could always leave.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang inquired about the Thunderclap Stronghold and the Hundred Flowers Palace.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi, eager for Qin Sang to eliminate them, provided detailed information, assuring Qin Sang he needn't hold back.  Due to their remote location, outside forces ignored them, leaving both the Thunderclap Stronghold and the Hundred Flowers Palace without powerful backing.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang nodded. "Deactivate the protective formation and let them in."</p><p>"Yes! Disciple will bring them in immediately!"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was ecstatic, readily adopting the role of a disciple, only to be sternly rebuked by Qin Sang.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>"Old Cui Xuan, have you made your decision?"</p><p>The Thunder Ghost Elder saw Cui Xuanzi return and bellowed.</p><p>He was confident, certain of Cui Xuanzi's submission.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi, who had left with a worried expression, now wore a cheerful one.  Returning to the edge of the protective formation, he deactivated it, sneering, "If you dare, come in and talk!"</p><p>The Thunder Ghost Elder and the alluring woman exchanged glances, believing Cui Xuanzi was bluffing.</p><p>The Thunder Ghost Elder spat, "Still playing tricks at this point!"</p><p>With that, the Thunder Ghost Elder led the way, the group swaggering into the Five Venom Sect, heading straight for the main hall.</p>
