<h1>Chapter 2093: Watching from the Sidelines</h1><p>A monk presented a confidential letter, a plea for aid from Li Yufu and the others.</p><p>The letter lay on the table, and everyone looked at Grandmaster Huaiyin.</p><p>Grandmaster Huaiyin said, “Waiting for all parties to come to a clear agreement, who knows how long it will take? Moreover, deploying troops is not something that can be done overnight. If we delay too long, the situation will be difficult to salvage. Currently, only the Western Wasteland can immediately dispatch reinforcements.”</p><p>The Tripartite Alliance clearly intended to remain on the sidelines, but Old Devil Fan had ample justification and couldn't be faulted.  Moreover, other factions likely harbored similar thoughts.</p><p>Old Devil Fan said with displeasure, “Does the Venerable Master mean that we should dispatch troops without consulting our fellow Daoists?”</p><p>“The Western Wasteland Allied Forces have the authority to adapt to changing circumstances, a rule established from the very beginning.  Desperate times call for desperate measures. Besides, we are not sending all cultivators to the North Sea. We will leave sufficient forces to defend against external enemies, while the rest will rush to the North Sea to alleviate their urgent situation.” Grandmaster Huaiyin paused slightly, then addressed Old Devil Fan, “Should the Western Wasteland face danger, as long as the Central Plains and the Eastern Sea provide timely reinforcements, there should be no fear of it falling.”</p><p>Palace Lord Mu and the others nodded in agreement with Grandmaster Huaiyin's words.</p><p>Bao Xi was overjoyed upon hearing this and bowed deeply to Grandmaster Huaiyin, “The Venerable Master possesses profound righteousness!”</p><p>Old Devil Fan snorted.  Grandmaster Huaiyin was clearly forcing the Tripartite Alliance to make a decision quickly. This was a tactic in plain sight, yet he couldn't threaten the other party by suggesting the Central Plains would abandon the Western Wasteland.</p><p>In fact, Old Devil Fan knew perfectly well that it was impossible for all factions to obey his commands.  Moreover, the Tripartite Alliance wanted to see a weakened North Sea, not one occupied by the Changyou Clan.</p><p>Before the North Sea completely fell, they still needed to intervene.</p><p>Considering this, Old Devil Fan didn't openly refute Grandmaster Huaiyin, but instead looked at another person beside him, “Fellow Daoist Lingshou, what are your thoughts?”</p><p>This person appeared elderly, with two long mustaches on his upper lip. He carried a circular tortoise shell on his back, his figure slightly hunched and somewhat small, as if he were curled up inside the shell.</p><p>He was a spirit turtle who had attained enlightenment, his Dharma name Lingshou. He hailed from the Eastern Sea and was a powerful general under Great Sage Longjing.</p><p>Since the beginning of the discussion, Holy King Lingshou had remained silent, his eyelids drooping, his breathing steady, appearing drowsy, and offering no opinions.</p><p>Old Devil Fan stared intently. Seeing that he couldn't avoid it, Holy King Lingshou's eyelids twitched. He slowly stroked his mustache with his right hand and said unhurriedly, “Without seeing Great Sage Longjing's decree, this humble one dares not make a decision. However, regardless of your intentions, this humble one will diligently defend the Western Wasteland.”</p><p>Holy King Lingshou's answer was very slippery, unwilling to get involved in this matter, but also not opposing anyone.</p><p>Helpless, Old Devil Fan could only ask Grandmaster Huaiyin in return, “How many people does the Venerable Master intend to deploy to reinforce the North Sea?”</p><p>Grandmaster Huaiyin looked at Bao Xi, “Fellow Daoists from the Four Saints Palace are currently stationed at Qiong Mountain. This poor monk will send people to Qiong Mountain to replace them and have the monks hidden in the Ancient Water Abyss follow Fellow Daoist Bao. How about that?”</p><p>Yuan Zhu interjected, “The situation in the north is still under control. I can also spare some demon troops for Fellow Daoist Bao to take.”</p><p>Bao Xi bowed to each of them, “Thank you, fellow Daoists. I will certainly live up to your expectations!”</p><p>Immediately afterward, Palace Lord Mu revealed surprising news, “I won't be giving Fellow Daoist Bao any troops. I just received a talisman message from Fellow Daoist Fang. The Witch Clan has decided to immediately dispatch troops to the North Sea. They might already be on their way.”</p><p>Hearing this, everyone was somewhat surprised.</p><p>The Demon Clan remained silent, the Tripartite Alliance used various excuses to prevaricate, yet the weakest Witch Clan was the first to express their firm support for the North Sea.</p><p>The situation hadn't developed as Old Devil Fan had anticipated.  The Western Wasteland and the Witch Clan were too decisive. While Grandmaster Huaiyin's upright character made it understandable, he hadn't expected the cunning Old Devil Fang to forgo waiting and watching.</p><p>However, this time, the Changyou Clan came with overwhelming force, determined to conquer the North Sea. These reinforcements could only delay their advance.  Ultimately, reversing the situation still depended on them.</p><p>Thinking of this, Old Devil Fan slammed the table and stood up, “Since you have all decided, why should this old man play the villain! You'd better pray that nothing happens to the Western Wasteland!”</p><p>Dropping these words, Old Devil Fan flung his sleeves and left. Holy King Lingshou also shakily rose and excused himself.</p><p>…</p><p>Central Plains Continent.</p><p>West of the Southern Barbarian Two States, beyond layers of mountains, lay a relatively flat wasteland, though still dominated by peaks and hills, with narrow plains.</p><p>The Witch Clan resided in this region. The Witch God Mountain, where they migrated from the Witch God Continent, was located at the very center of this area, a place of reverence for the Witch Clan.</p><p>Witch God Mountain held a lofty position in the hearts of the Witch Clan, both due to ancient legends and because it was the cultivation place of the Great Witch Priest.</p><p>After arriving in the Central Plains Continent, the Witch Clan discovered several other sacred cultivation grounds, no less impressive than Witch God Mountain, perhaps even surpassing it. Many Witch Clan elders established their cave abodes there, but Witch God Mountain's status remained unshakeable.</p><p>Even after that heavenly tribulation, which severely damaged Witch God Mountain, rendering it unrecognizable and the Sacred Shrine completely destroyed, Old Devil Fang, the Great Witch Priest, never considered relocating.</p><p>Atop Witch God Mountain.</p><p>The scars from the heavenly tribulation remained, the summit directly obliterated by the blood wind.</p><p>Later, the blood wind formed a swirling crimson storm above Witch God Mountain, taking a long time to show signs of dissipating.</p><p>The lingering blood wind caused widespread fear, considered an ominous sign by the Witch Clan.</p><p>This was a power that even Nascent Soul cultivators found terrifying. Because of this, they believed Qin Sang, targeted by the Blood Sun, had no hope of survival.</p><p>The summit of Witch God Mountain remained desolate, while on a lower level, several ancient halls stood scattered.</p><p>One of these was Old Devil Fang's palace.</p><p>A young Witch Clan man arrived before the palace and gently touched the restrictive barrier. Hearing a voice say, “Come in,” he pushed the door open and entered. He saw a cicada resting on the throne and respectfully bowed, “Child greets Foster Father!”</p><p>The cicada remained motionless, but Old Devil Fang's voice emerged, “Rise.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The young Witch Clan man straightened up, “Everything is prepared according to Foster Father's instructions.”</p><p>Old Devil Fang hummed in acknowledgement, then said, “You personally lead them to the North Sea. Go now.”</p><p>The young man, however, didn't immediately comply, his expression hesitant.</p><p>“Do you have any questions?” Old Devil Fang saw through his thoughts.</p><p>“Child has something he doesn't understand, and dares to ask Foster Father for guidance!”</p><p>The young man knelt on one knee, “The Tripartite Alliance and the two Demon Clans haven't expressed their stance, which is very unusual. Why doesn't Foster Father wait a little longer before making a decision?  The greater their conflict, the more advantageous it is for us, isn’t it?”</p><p>Old Devil Fang seemed to have anticipated this, his tone unperturbed. He asked in return, “Do you think they will allow the North Sea to fall?”</p><p>The young man was taken aback. After pondering for a moment, he said, “The Tripartite Alliance definitely won’t stand idly by, but the Demon Clan might.”</p><p>“Fairy Liuli, the Tripartite Alliance, the Demon Clan…”</p><p>Old Devil Fang said indifferently, “Any one of them is far stronger than our clan. If our clan wants to survive and recuperate here, we must form an alliance with one of them. We previously chose to stand with Fairy Liuli. If the North Sea suffers this heavy blow and declines from now on, we would have to rely on the Tripartite Alliance or the Demon Clan. Since they are all foreign clans, what’s the difference?”</p><p>“The Demon Clan is unruly, the Tripartite Alliance is tyrannical. It's better to rely on Fairy Liuli. At least her character is well-known, and she treats all equally when distributing Azure Spirit Energy, never discriminating against our clan.” The young man murmured, understanding his foster father's good intentions. Finally, he sighed, “By the Witch God, when will our clan usher in its revival and escape this situation!”</p><p>“As long as we are in the Great Thousand World, there is hope.  As long as our clan continues to exist, we will eventually encounter other members of our clan…”</p><p>Old Devil Fang's voice gradually faded away, and the young man silently withdrew from the palace.</p><p>…</p><p>Tripartite Alliance, Main Hall.</p><p>At the very top were three high chairs, belonging to the Eight Scenery Pavilion, the Sweet Dew Monastery, and the Heavenly Hao Tower.  Because Old Devil Fan was absent, one chair was empty. The other two were occupied by True Monarch Qishen of the Eight Scenery Pavilion and Venerable Master Yinci of the Sweet Dew Monastery.</p><p>They sat high above, gazing down below.</p><p>Below sat experts from various sects, including numerous sect leaders and grand elders.</p><p>After the three sects of Buddhism, Daoism, and Demonic Cultivation formed the Tripartite Alliance, they also drew in sects close to them. Later, when Qin Sang ordered the Tripartite Alliance to gather the power of the Central Plains to search for the Ascension Platform, other sects, unable to oppose them, gradually joined the alliance, though their power couldn't compare to the three main sects.</p><p>At this moment, True Monarch Qishen and Venerable Master Yinci specifically summoned the various sects of the Central Plains, regardless of whether they were members of the Tripartite Alliance, and announced the North Sea's plight, discussing the matter together.</p><p>In the past, major events were generally decided by the large sects, with smaller sects following suit. This kind of scene was uncommon.</p><p>The various sects argued endlessly, some saying the North Sea should be rescued, others believing that the Changyou Clan was employing a diversionary tactic and they should be wary of an attack on the Central Plains. Some even thought the North Sea was exaggerating the danger. With Fairy Liuli stationed there, how could they retreat so quickly? They must simply be unwilling to suffer heavy casualties, wanting these reinforcements to be sent to their deaths…</p><p>Cultivators possessed rich imaginations, with all sorts of theories circulating.  When the discussion became heated, they even started cursing at each other, accusing the other party of harboring ulterior motives, turning the main hall into a bustling marketplace.</p><p>At this rate, who knew how long it would take to reach a conclusion. Yet, True Monarch Qishen and Venerable Master Yinci made no attempt to stop them.</p><p>Until nightfall, no conclusion was reached.  Venerable Master Yinci announced they would continue the discussion the following day.</p><p>Lu Zhang left the hall alone and returned to the Nevermind Mountain Palace.  Looking up at the bright moon, he let out a soft sigh.</p><p>“Why is Sect Leader Lu worried?” A clear voice came from behind.</p><p>Lu Zhang had already sensed him and didn't turn his head, “Has the Poison King not noticed anything during this time?”</p><p>The Poison King walked to Lu Zhang's side, gazing at the distant night scene, and chuckled, “Forgive my poor eyesight, but True Monarch Qishen and Venerable Master Yinci were never known for their decisiveness, otherwise, they would be the sect leaders of the three sects. They don't dare to make decisions lightly, and their prestige is inferior to the three sect leaders.  It's quite normal for them to lose control of the situation momentarily.”</p><p>Lu Zhang chuckled and shook his head without speaking.</p><p>“However, the timing of the three sect leaders’ closed-door cultivation is indeed somewhat coincidental, especially for refining such important treasures.  I wonder how confident they are,” the Poison King said meaningfully.</p><p>Lu Zhang frowned slightly, “What are you trying to say, fellow Daoist?”</p><p>The Poison King shook his head, “I'm merely expressing my thoughts, nothing more. It’s surely a coincidence.”</p><p>Lu Zhang had also harbored some doubts, but quickly dismissed them.  Regardless, the Tripartite Alliance couldn't possibly collude with the Changyou Clan.</p><p>“In that case, please be careful with your words, fellow Daoist, lest it cause misunderstandings.”</p><p>The Poison King nodded and dropped the subject, changing the topic to ask, “I hear Sect Leader Lu and True Monarch Qin had a deep friendship back then?”</p><p>Lu Zhang’s expression turned nostalgic, and he sighed, “Back then, thanks to Fellow Daoist Qin's assistance, this Lu managed to successfully break through to the late Nascent Soul stage.  It’s a pity that my senior brother decided to close off the mountain.  When Fellow Daoist Qin was in danger, this Lu couldn't offer any help.”</p><p>“Fairy Liuli is True Monarch Qin’s widow, and the Azure Goat Temple was founded by True Monarch Qin.  So, regardless of the outcome here, Sect Leader Lu will definitely reinforce the North Sea?” the Poison King asked.</p><p>Lu Zhang didn't conceal his intentions and nodded, “Precisely! I wonder what fellow Daoist’s plans are?”</p><p>He knew that the Poison King had come specifically and mentioned this matter with a definite purpose.</p><p>“The Tripartite Alliance's stance is unclear, and we rely on them, so our apprehensions are understandable. Sect Leader Lu can surely empathize. However, this humble one has created several poison formations suitable for the battlefield in recent years and specifically selected some elders and disciples to cultivate them.  I'm just looking for an opportunity to test their power. If Sect Leader Lu agrees, I'll have them wait at Nevermind Mountain,” the Poison King said.</p><p>Lu Zhang’s expression turned serious, “On behalf of Palace Lord Li, this Lu thanks fellow Daoist!”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the sound of something breaking through the air came from afar. The newcomers were the Sect Leader of the瓊影 Sect and Hall Master Mu of the Six States Hall.</p><p>The Sect Leader of the 瓊影 Sect was a woman with a graceful figure, but her face was veiled with light gauze, making her features unclear.</p><p>Hall Master Mu and the Six States Hall were not what they used to be.  Having received Liuli's support, they were no longer just a large trading company in the Central Plains, but their business extended throughout the North Sea and various regions of the Central Plains, becoming a true behemoth.</p><p>“Greetings, Sect Leader Murong, Hall Master Mu!” Lu Zhang and the Poison King bowed in greeting.</p><p>Seeing the Poison King, they weren't too surprised. Sect Leader Murong returned the greeting and got straight to the point, “Alliance Leader Shen’s sect is in trouble, and fellow Daoists of the Heavenly Crafts Alliance are indignant. We cannot stand idly by. The arguments here will continue for who knows how long, and these people are unreliable. This one wants to ask Sect Leader Lu's opinion, should we dispatch some reinforcements first?”</p><p>Hall Master Mu also said, “The Six States Hall is already operating at full capacity, dispatching pills and magical artifacts to the North Sea!”</p><p>Hearing this, the Poison King smiled, “Great minds think alike. This humble one was just discussing this matter with Sect Leader Lu!”</p><p>Besides them, other factions also made different choices, some hedging their bets, others watching from the sidelines.</p><p>…</p><p>Eastern Sea.</p><p>Great Sage Longjing's most secluded palace.</p><p>Great Sage Longjing wasn’t in closed-door cultivation. He sat majestically on the throne while a demon cultivator knelt below, reporting the situation outside.</p><p>“The Tripartite Alliance hasn't made a move yet?”</p><p>Great Sage Longjing rubbed his chin, somewhat surprised, a contemplative look on his face, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the talisman message before him, the same plea for aid from Li Yufu and the others.</p><p>The Tripartite Alliance must have received it as well, but their attitude was quite intriguing.</p><p>“Any news from those fellows in the Demon Sea?”</p><p>The demon cultivator replied, “No news yet.”</p><p>After pondering for a long time, Great Sage Longjing waved his hand, and the talisman message floated towards the demon cultivator. “Remember, this king has been in closed-door cultivation, seeking a breakthrough. You all remain on standby, keep a close watch on the Tripartite Alliance and the Demon Sea, and report to this king immediately if there's any news!”</p><p>“This subordinate obeys!”</p><p>The demon cultivator carefully put away the talisman message, bowed, and retreated.</p>
