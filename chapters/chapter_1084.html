<h1>Chapter 176: The Escape</h1><p>His divine sense swept over the lotus seed. It didn't seem to be a magical treasure.  Inscriptions surfaced, resembling a cultivation technique. Just as Qin Sang was about to examine it closely, Bai’s warning reached him, and he hurriedly withdrew his divine sense, storing the seed away.</p><p>“Outside!”</p><p>Bai’s tone was grave.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up. His pursuit of Mou Laomo had led them to the foot of Yitian Peak.  A thin mist drifted around, obscuring his vision.</p><p>Stone forests stretched out, and mountains rose and fell.</p><p>There wasn't a soul in sight.</p><p>But alerted by Bai, Qin Sang felt a faint sense of being watched. He immediately activated his Heavenly Eye, his vision piercing through the Spirit Suppression Domain. He vaguely saw layers of mountain shadows beyond the domain.</p><p>On one of the peaks, figures were watching them.</p><p>“Why are there so many people here? Is Mou Laomo walking into a trap?” Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>He had assumed that the gravely injured Mou Laomo would flee alone, avoiding any contact.</p><p>This group had clearly been hiding nearby, right in Mou Laomo’s escape path, and were alerted by the commotion of the ambush.</p><p>Only a limited number of cultivators entered the Inner Halls. The Inner Halls were vast, with countless secret realms, and even fewer ventured to the secluded valley and the Spirit Suppression Domain. So many people gathered here, waiting outside the domain, must have a purpose.</p><p>Were they the Demon Lord’s subordinates or another faction?</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed something unusual about these individuals. Some had horns, while others even had tails!</p><p>“Demonic Beasts!  Transformed Great Demons!”</p><p>Within the Seven Kills Hall, even in the Inner Halls, there were only ferocious beasts.</p><p>Top-tier ferocious beasts were comparable in strength to Transformed Great Demons, but for unknown reasons, their ferocity overwhelmed their minds, preventing transformation. These demonic beasts must have infiltrated from the outside.</p><p>Jiu Fengwang’s purpose in sending Chang Ling into the Immortal Forbidden Zone was indeed to infiltrate the Inner Halls, and she wasn't alone.  So many Great Demons had entered together.</p><p>What were these Transformed Great Demons, lurking at the edge of the Spirit Suppression Domain, planning?</p><p>Almost instinctively, Qin Sang activated the disguise technique Yuan Zhu had taught him.</p><p>The Transformed Great Demons gathered outside the Spirit Suppression Domain were likely limited by its suppression due to their insufficient cultivation.  This didn't mean there weren't more powerful demons inside.</p><p>If there were late-stage Transformed Great Demons, they might already be within the Spirit Suppression Domain, lurking somewhere.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.  While the Great Demons couldn't enter for now, he didn't want to become their enemy or be targeted by them.</p><p>This technique would imbue him with a faint aura of a Transformed Great Demon, confusing their judgment and muddying the waters.</p><p>But when he saw a tense, beautiful face among the group, his heart sank. He knew something was wrong.</p><p>Jiu Fengwang was there!</p><p>Their last encounter was during the second opening of the Outer Halls by the Wu Clan.</p><p>He had disguised himself as a demonic beast and met Jiu Fengwang. He had then feigned death and escaped into the hurricane. Judging by her expression, she had recognized him.</p><p>Outside the Spirit Suppression Domain.</p><p>The Demon Kings emerged, looking towards Yitian Peak with varied expressions.</p><p>They were hiding there, waiting for the Flood Dragon King and the Nine-Lived Black Tortoise to steal the dragon corpse, but unexpectedly witnessed the hunt of a human Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>“Why is it him?”</p><p>Jiu Fengwang recognized Qin Sang. She finally remembered him as the demonic beast she thought had perished.</p><p>The other Demon Kings were astonished when they heard Jiu Fengwang’s description.</p><p>“He was only at the Demon Core stage during the last opening of the Seven Kills Hall. It's impossible for him to surpass us in such a short time. How can he move freely within the Spirit Suppression Domain and hunt a Nascent Soul cultivator alone? Are you mistaken?”</p><p>The Spirit Suppression Domain’s restrictions applied to all, not just demonic beasts.</p><p>“The heavenly tribulation just now wasn't particularly strong.”</p><p>“The power of the black fire is hard to determine, but I felt a sense of dread.”</p><p>“His aura is strange…”</p><p>　　……</p><p>The Demon Kings discussed among themselves.</p><p>“It’s him!  I’m certain!” Jiu Fengwang stared intently at Qin Sang.</p><p>If he was also a discarded demonic beast, cultivating the Blood Burning True Art would have prevented him from transforming. If he was human, he couldn't possibly have a higher cultivation level than her, otherwise he would have captured her and taken the Heavenly Phoenix Plume and True Feather last time.</p><p>He dared to wander around right under her nose, and she hadn't even noticed!</p><p>Unforgivable!</p><p>Jiu Fengwang was furious. “The Seven Kills Hall has always been occupied by humans… He must have a treasure that can resist the suppression of the Spirit Suppression Domain!”</p><p>Before she finished speaking, a crimson light pierced through the mist.</p><p>Jiu Fengwang, without hesitation, unleashed the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather.</p><p>The other Demon Kings exchanged glances but didn't intervene. Jiu Fengwang’s judgment might be correct. If they obtained this treasure, they too could enter the Spirit Suppression Domain to search for the corpse.</p><p>Unfortunately, they didn't have a Heavenly Phoenix True Feather and could only watch.</p><p>Seeing the red light, Qin Sang immediately recalled the shocking scene from before, when Chang Ling displayed terrifying power, breaking the Immortal Forbidden Zone and causing it to tremble.</p><p>Could this treasure also withstand the Spirit Suppression Domain’s restrictions?</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang cursed inwardly and instantly turned to flee.</p><p>However, the plume seemed to possess the same instantaneous movement ability as a Nascent Soul cultivator. Like a phantom, it entered the Spirit Suppression Domain one moment, and the next, Qin Sang's vision was filled with crimson.</p><p>Within the red light, a long plume flickered faintly, and a graceful figure gradually materialized – Jiu Fengwang.</p><p>His path was blocked!</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked and immediately changed direction without pausing.</p><p>The plume descended from the sky, forming a barrier of flames.  Jiu Fengwang's figure slowly emerged. With the power of the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather, she successfully entered the Spirit Suppression Domain.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Flames danced wildly.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix True Feather’s power was burning.</p><p>Jiu Fengwang struggled to maintain the plume’s power.  Flames surrounded her body like a brilliant feathered robe, resembling a true Heavenly Phoenix emerging from the void.</p><p>She breathed heavily, her face flushed, clearly strained. She needed to stabilize herself first and couldn't immediately pursue Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing the three-colored escape light on Qin Sang, a strange glint flashed in Jiu Fengwang's eyes.</p><p>This man’s escape technique far surpassed that of ordinary Core Formation cultivators, and since she had to focus on controlling the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather, catching him would take some effort.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Jiu Fengwang formulated a strategy and transformed into a red light, pursuing him relentlessly.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The two chased and fled through the stone forest, their escape lights crisscrossing, causing sections to collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang tried several times to escape towards Yitian Peak, but each time he was intercepted and blocked by Jiu Fengwang.</p><p>Her intention was clear: to force him out of the Spirit Suppression Domain.</p><p>He had already used the Star Conch, and Jiu Fengwang wouldn't give him a chance to cast the Binding Lightning Technique.  With only the nine demonic banners, Qin Sang dared not stop and fight her.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Jiu Fengwang attacked, a large expanse of rosy light transforming into a phoenix and smashing towards him.</p><p>The phoenix was composed of countless tiny feathers, containing incredibly violent power. It easily plowed a path through the stone forest, pulverizing the stone trees in its wake.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a scorching heat, intense pain, and a sensation of being incinerated.</p><p>There was a significant gap between him and a true Transformed Great Demon!</p>
