<h1>Chapter 845: Leaving the Island</h1><p>With his swordsmanship skills, although Qin Sang's cultivation level was slightly lower, he was足以 to be considered their equal.</p><p>Sword Light Splitting was a realm pursued by all sword cultivators throughout their lives. Very few late-stage Core Formation cultivators could comprehend it, and those who did were all renowned grand sword cultivators.</p><p>No one dared to underestimate such a sword cultivator.</p><p>The two people sitting beside him bowed slightly and cupped their hands towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Yue Xiangu sat upright and said seriously, "Reverend Qingfeng's mastery of swordsmanship is admirable. Fellow Daoist Zou's words are not false, Reverend is capable of fighting late-stage Core Formation experts! However..."</p><p>Pausing slightly, Yue Xiangu continued, "Forgive my bluntness, my purpose is to rescue someone and bring them back to Great Wilderness Island alive. Reverend's swordsmanship alone seems insufficient."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly and looked at Old Zou.</p><p>Old Zou's expression was also somewhat helpless.</p><p>Sword cultivators were indeed extremely powerful and awe-inspiring. But the gap caused by insufficient cultivation was all-around. If they were simply looking for a fighter, Qin Sang would undoubtedly be the best choice, but Yue Xiangu's purpose was to find someone, and her words were not unreasonable.</p><p>Old Zou shrugged at Qin Sang, indicating that he couldn't do anything about it.</p><p>Not only could he obtain the Mountain Vine, but he could also return to the Boundless Sea. This was a rare opportunity, and Qin Sang was unwilling to give it up. He lowered his head slightly, pondered for a moment, and said, "This humble Daoist also has some insights into escape techniques, and I believe that in times of crisis, I will not hold back my fellow Daoists..."</p><p>As he spoke, a crimson light surged from Qin Sang's body, and a faint image of a Flood Dragon appeared, competing with a sharp sword. Then, Qin Sang transformed into a streak of startling rainbow light, accompanied by a clap of thunder, and flew out of the hall. After circling briefly outside, he returned.</p><p>The crimson light dissipated, the Flood Dragon's image vanished, the thunder faded, and Qin Sang reappeared in his original spot. The escape technique displayed in this instant made the four people in the hall look grave and secretly shocked.</p><p>Qin Sang had carefully considered and decided to reveal his escape technique to impress Yue Xiangu.</p><p>At the time of rescue, a top-notch escape technique would definitely play a huge role. He didn't believe Yue Xiangu would still refuse.</p><p>Any one of the several treasures on him would surely gain their approval, but those were his trump cards and could easily arouse the greed of others.</p><p>The Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman was hidden in his Qi Sea, disguised by sword Qi and thunder sounds. As long as it wasn't exposed for too long, he believed they wouldn't be able to see through the true appearance of the talisman.</p><p>If those people couldn't figure out his background, they naturally wouldn't dare to have any wicked thoughts.</p><p>Sure enough, after seeing the escape technique Qin Sang displayed, Yue Xiangu's face was full of pleasant surprise, and she agreed without hesitation for Qin Sang to join them, entrusting him with an important task, "Reverend's escape technique is so superb, I feel ashamed of my own! With Reverend joining us, I finally feel at ease! After we find that person, I hope Reverend will not hesitate to protect her closely. If we are surrounded by demonic beasts, take her away first if necessary!"</p><p>Hearing Yue Xiangu's words, Qin Sang was secretly surprised.</p><p>He didn't know who they were trying to save, but Yue Xiangu valued that person's life more than her own and was willing to stay behind herself if there was danger.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious, but he didn't ask too many questions. He agreed to Yue Xiangu's request, then changed the subject and said, "Fellow Daoist Yue, I am willing to risk my life and accompany you into the depths of the Demonic Sea to save someone for the sake of the Mountain Vine and the Teleportation Talisman. If something has happened to that person, and we cannot find them..."</p><p>"The reward will still be paid!"</p><p>Yue Xiangu declared decisively, "I will deposit the treasures at the Xiang'an Auction House and make an oath with all fellow Daoists. Even if we can't find the target, the reward will still be paid!"</p><p>Old Zou stroked his beard and smiled, "It wasn't in vain that Zou worked hard for this. You all must have many things to discuss, so I won't disturb you. I'll take my leave first!"</p><p>After Old Zou left, Qin Sang stayed in Yue Xiangu's cave.</p><p>Yue Xiangu planned to find three late-stage Core Formation helpers. With Qin Sang joining, the number was complete. After everyone got to know each other, they made an oath and discussed the departure time.</p><p>Currently, Great Wilderness Island was besieged by demonic beasts, and traces of transformed demonic beasts could be found everywhere. Leaving the island was the first dangerous obstacle they had to face.</p><p>"The demon race is arrogant and stirring up trouble. I just arrived from the Inner Sea not long ago and learned that some seniors have been angered by the demon race and have decided to take the initiative to attack and teach them a lesson. The time is set for three days from now. We can take advantage of the chaos to leave. Everyone go back and wait for my news. We'll set off as soon as the time is right!"</p><p>Yue Xiangu had gathered intelligence and had already made plans.</p><p>"We're leaving in three days, the time is so tight... The high-level cultivators are actually going to take the initiative to attack, and there hasn't been a whisper of it. It's good to take this opportunity to leave and avoid this great battle..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered these thoughts and returned to his cave to continue patrolling.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The four gathered on a small island north of Great Wilderness Island. They opened a cave underground and waited for the opportune moment.</p><p>The human cultivators would attack at midnight, focusing on the south, which would attract most of the demonic beasts there. Qin Sang and the others would wait for the chaos to erupt and then escape from the north.</p><p>The cave was dim, and the four people were silent.</p><p>Besides Qin Sang and Yue Xiangu, the other two were men. One looked middle-aged, and the other was an old man, looking not much younger than Yue Xiangu.</p><p>The middle-aged man was named Kong Yun, and he was also a member of the East Pole Alliance Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>The old man called himself Bamboo Mountain Elder, but his true identity was an elder of a sect in the Inner Sea. He was recruited as a guest elder by a chamber of commerce while traveling in the Demonic Sea.</p><p>Like Qin Sang, they were all moved by Yue Xiangu's treasures.</p><p>These two had profound True Essence and formidable strength, not to be underestimated. Of course, the skills Qin Sang displayed also made them treat him with respect, and they were all amicable towards each other.</p><p>"Midnight has arrived!"</p><p>Yue Xiangu whispered, and everyone flashed to the entrance of the cave, looking towards the south. They saw the southern sky suddenly illuminated by several dazzling auroras, as bright as day.</p><p>The stars were obscured by the aurora, and even the moon seemed to dim.</p><p>The distance was too far, they could only see this phenomenon, their faces full of awe.</p><p>After the aurora appeared, they immediately felt several terrifying auras rushing towards the south, and the surrounding beast hordes were also restless, converging towards the south.</p><p>The aurora lasted for a full cup of tea's time, then shimmering lights collided and chased each other in the sky in all directions, and the chaos had spread.</p><p>Yue Xiangu gave the order, and the four of them immediately set off, silently flying towards the north.</p><p>When they reached the outer area, they heard shouts of killing. Demonic beasts were attacking the auxiliary islands and clashing with the cultivators. A chaotic battle ensued. The four exchanged glances, concealed their auras, and slipped into the fray.</p><p>All four were highly skilled individuals. In order not to attract the attention of powerful demonic beasts, they restrained themselves when they attacked, but with their combined strength, they didn't encounter much danger and successfully broke through.</p><p>After escaping the danger, everyone looked at Yue Xiangu.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yue Xiangu showed no sign of stopping, leading them directly north.</p><p>Compared to the other three directions, even before the demonic chaos occurred, the cultivators' strength north of Great Wilderness Island was weak, and they hadn't explored very far.</p><p>It was said that there was a powerful demon race in the north, and the cultivators didn't want to provoke them.  They hadn't expected that the person Yue Xiangu was looking for was there, no wonder she brought so many experts for the rescue.</p>
