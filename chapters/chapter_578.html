<h1>Chapter 571: Rewards</h1><p>Never assume others are like yourself, especially when dealing with Yuan Ying cultivators.  </p><p>Qin Sang, keeping this in mind, followed Dongyang Bo, passing effortlessly through the hordes of demonic beasts to the stone hall.</p><p>The vulture-like creatures, upon discovering the intruders, alerted the entire mountain.  A massive wave of beasts attacked, darkening the sky.</p><p>Dongyang Bo killed them in pairs, then in groups.</p><p>A swathe of corpses and black blood stained the stone mountain, the stench overpowering.</p><p>Finally, the beasts were terrified, circling and screeching, too afraid to land.</p><p>Others ascending the mountain benefited from this, quickly climbing to the stone hall while the beasts were distracted, reaching it unscathed.</p><p>When Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo entered, the beasts finally gave up, falling silent and returning to their perches. Looking back, the mountain was still covered with beasts, seemingly undiminished in number, a surprising sight.</p><p>A passage led to other stone halls.</p><p>Inside, the hall was empty.</p><p>At the far end, a faint light shimmered, suggesting a door.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>Earlier, several people had entered ahead of them, yet now the hall was empty, indicating they’d already passed through the door.</p><p>Beyond that door seemed to be another vast space. The true scale of the Purple Micro Palace was unknown.</p><p>The thousand palaces below, arranged in a sprawling array, were already magnificent.</p><p>Qin Sang anticipated great wonders from the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>“Dongyang Daoist's swordsmanship is divine; I am greatly indebted to you,”</p><p>A laugh echoed through the stone hall.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  His gaze swept the hall; a figure, materializing from thin air, appeared at the entrance—a man in simple robes, an elderly cultivator.</p><p>Recognizing him, Qin Sang remembered the man. He was a Yuan Ying cultivator from the Skyfaring League, one of the few to survive the great battle, remarkably well-preserved, his strength evident.</p><p>Dongyang Bo showed no surprise, replying with a smile, “Those mere carrion vultures, carrying only corpse poison, were easily dealt with by Daoist Dongyun. I hardly deserve any credit.”</p><p>“These carrion vultures originate from the Immortal Tombs; their poison is quite strange. Your swordsmanship is perfect for dispelling it; I would have had more trouble,”</p><p>The man in robes shook his head, slowly approaching.</p><p>His withered face was deeply lined, his eyes dull and listless, making him appear truly aged.</p><p>It was unclear if this was his natural state or the result of the great battle's toll.</p><p>The old man's lifeless eyes flickered, fixing on Chen Yan.  His voice held a deep meaning, "This must be Daoist Chen Yan.  I am Dongyun Xian. I've never heard of such a supremely talented cultivator from Mount Shao Hua, forming a Golden Core so silently, deceiving everyone. You two have kept yourselves well-hidden; were you planning to surprise us in the Heavenly Mountains?”</p><p>“Chen Yan greets Daoist Dongyun.”</p><p>Chen Yan bowed, not responding.</p><p>Dongyang Bo chuckled, “Daoist Dongyun, why are you here alone? Has Zhen Daoist been affected and decided not to go to the Heavenly Mountains? Remember, victory and defeat are common in war; the Crime Abyss's schemes cannot last. If the cultivators of both realms cooperate and stand together, we will surely prevail!”</p><p>Dongyun Xian nodded, “You're right! Though we grieve, we will not be defeated. We must avenge those who died!  Zhen Daoist needs to take care of those who lost their physical bodies, so I must leave ahead. Once Zhen Daoist is finished, he won’t miss the treasure hunt in the Heavenly Mountains…”</p><p>Dongyun Xian walked deeper into the hall. After a few steps, he turned, his gaze sweeping over Qin Sang and the others. He softly asked, “Which one is young friend Qin Sang?”</p><p>All eyes turned to Qin Sang, expressions varied.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai and the others were incredibly surprised.</p><p>Qin Sang was perplexed; he'd never met Dongyun Xian before and didn't understand why he was looking for him, nor how he knew his name.</p><p>However, his tone was kind, suggesting no harm.</p><p>Qin Sang sought his master's permission with a look.  Seeing Dongyang Bo nod, he quickly stepped forward, bowing, “Junior Qin Sang greets senior.”</p><p>Dongyun Xian studied Qin Sang for a moment, then nodded, “Excellent!”</p><p>He turned and left, leaving Qin Sang completely bewildered.</p><p>"Don't be surprised! We were able to anticipate the Wujimen leader's actions thanks to Chongyi Daochang's warning.  Chongyi Daochang, in turn, learned about it from a disciple of theirs named Yunyouzi.  During the recent Yuan Ying meeting, Yunyouzi from Taiyi Danzong was asked to explain the situation, and he voluntarily mentioned your crucial role. He detailed your encounter with the Wujimen leader and Huang Tian in the Wuyavalley, and how you discovered signs of their collusion."  Dongyang Bo explained.</p><p>"In this resolution of the Zuìyuān conspiracy, both realms were saved from danger. Although it was unintentional on your part, the Yuan Ying elders still owe you a debt of gratitude.</p><p>"Right now, our focus is on Ziwei Palace. We haven't had time to discuss your rewards, but you will receive them upon our return.</p><p>"I heard from Fengming that you couldn't form your Golden Core despite taking the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower.</p><p>"Don't worry now. With so many Yuan Ying elders, we'll certainly find a way to quickly raise your cultivation, and then prepare the most suitable natal treasure for you—that's only fitting.</p><p>"But, even with such great rewards, remember to remain humble. Don't think that these external gains will guarantee your safety. Do you understand?"</p><p>Qin Sang, suppressing his elation, bowed respectfully. "Disciple understands and will remember the Master's teachings."</p><p>Dongyang Bo grunted, "Let's go."</p><p>Dongyang Bo and Chenyan walked ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang followed, his mind already wandering to the future. He’d expected a long and arduous process to obtain a natal treasure, but now one awaited him, readily available.  A stroke of luck had yielded such rewards, all thanks to Yunyouzi not forgetting him!</p><p>"Congratulations, Qin Shixiong!"  Lian Qiumubai openly envied Qin Sang's situation.  He envied not so much the Golden Core breakthrough, but the ease with which Qin Sang would obtain a natal treasure.  His own Master had instructed him to gather and refine the materials himself, as a trial.</p><p>Mu Yifeng and the others were even more envious of Qin Sang's access to the Yuan Ying's assistance—Golden Core formation was now a certainty, bringing him closer to the Dao.  They didn't know that Qin Sang no longer needed their help.</p><p>Still, Qin Sang was very happy.  He didn't need their help to form his Golden Core, but he could request that his reward be changed.  With so many Yuan Ying ancestors present, healing his hidden injuries would surely be within their capabilities.</p>
