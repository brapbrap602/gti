<h1>Chapter 1142: The Old Demon</h1><p>The other party had been lurking in the Demon King's lair, only acting now.  Did they, like me, infiltrate with the guards?</p><p>This is terrifying.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly didn't detect anything.</p><p>Qin Sang believed the other party was unlikely to be a Nascent Soul cultivator or a powerful transformed demon; otherwise, he would have been exposed.</p><p>Composing himself, Qin Sang didn't make a move, slowing his pace and silently following.</p><p>The Demon King's favored concubine's quarters were brightly lit.</p><p>A grey wolf led a group of lesser demons guarding the mountain, now all dejected.</p><p>While a celebratory feast was taking place ahead, they were being scolded.</p><p>The Demon King's concubine vented her anger on them. Only after she was tired of scolding and had returned did things quiet down for a moment.</p><p>“Keep your eyes peeled!  If anything happens, before the Demon King orders it, I'll seal your cultivation and throw you all into the Serpent's Lair!”</p><p>The grey wolf held its breath, its eyes flashing fiercely as it bared its teeth.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>The next moment, a grey hawk demon appeared from the shadows, flying directly towards the grey wolf and its companions, moving cautiously, as if afraid of disturbing the Demon King's concubine.</p><p>Seeing the hawk, the grey wolf felt a sense of familiarity. It remembered it as a lesser demon under White Feather Eagle.</p><p>“It’s you?”</p><p>The lesser demons were about to surround it, but the grey wolf stopped them.</p><p>“Did White Feather Eagle send you?”</p><p>The hawk couldn't speak human language, but it nodded repeatedly, flying to the grey wolf, carefully placing a pouch on the ground. A tinkling sound followed, along with a faint, rich aroma of alcohol.</p><p>Then, the hawk respectfully stepped aside, pointing upwards with its wing.</p><p>“The Demon King ordered you to deliver the divine wine?”</p><p>The grey wolf's eyes lit up.  Seeing the pouch filled with bottles of fine wine, its frustration vanished. It snatched a few bottles and tossed the pouch behind it.</p><p>“Everyone, the Demon King hasn't forgotten us! Share it!”</p><p>The lesser demons, already salivating, cheered and scrambled to grab the wine.</p><p>“Excellent wine!”</p><p>The grey wolf drank a bottle in one gulp, smacking its lips in satisfaction. “I heard this divine wine was bought from Yuan Demon King. It truly lives up to its reputation.”</p><p>After drinking three bottles in a row, the grey wolf looked at the hawk and mocked, “I think your Demon King should be called White Mouse. Such a coward! The Demon King orders him to send us wine, yet he doesn't dare to come himself.”</p><p>The hawk replied, “Wolf King, please calm down.  Lord Eagle is stationed on the front mountain and cannot leave.”</p><p>“Tch…”</p><p>The grey wolf scoffed, then froze.</p><p>The lesser demons were stunned.</p><p>This hawk, never enlightened by the Demon King, had just spoken.</p><p>“Down! Down! Down!”</p><p>The hawk gently patted down with its wing.</p><p>The lesser demons' eyes rolled back, falling unconscious.</p><p>The grey wolf, a demon at the Core Formation stage, wasn't so easily subdued. But as it lunged at the hawk, it felt its body go limp, its demonic power stagnating, unable to exert any strength.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The grey wolf crashed to the ground, struggling to fight back. Suddenly, a dazzling flash of light illuminated its surroundings, as a web of interweaving lightning descended, causing a searing pain before it passed out.</p><p>“These Immortal Drunkenness wines were hard for me to get in Immortal Demon City. They can even knock out late Core Formation stage demons.  It’s a pity it only works when drunk.”</p><p>The hawk’s eyes twinkled with pride as it quickly dragged the unconscious demons into a hidden place.</p><p>Then, it spat out a pearl.</p><p>As soon as the pearl left its mouth, the hawk transformed.  Its aura surged.</p><p>Its feathers were no longer grey but a thunderous silver-white, shimmering with lightning seemingly sliding across its wings.</p><p>It resembled a thunder beast born of lightning!</p><p>Its eyes were sharp, its claws like swords.  Though still hawk-like in appearance, it was infinitely more majestic than before; the difference was like comparing the moon to a firefly.</p><p>Even more shockingly, the falcon was merely a low-level demon just moments ago, but now it has suddenly become a mid-stage demon!</p><p>“This mirage pearl my mother left me is quite useful for disguise, but it requires me to seal my cultivation to work perfectly.  Being at your beck and call for so many years has been incredibly frustrating!”</p><p>It viciously kicked the wolf, then looked towards the concubine's chambers.  A pearl flashed, mist swirled, and after being swallowed again, it transformed into a wolf, silently slipping towards the chambers.</p><p>In a forest clearing…</p><p>Qin Sang was hidden among the trees, observing everything.</p><p>Seeing the transformed falcon demon, Qin Sang felt a sudden sense of familiarity.</p><p>“No way?”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the falcon's silvery feathers.</p><p>Suddenly, she remembered years ago, when she and Yun Youzi infiltrated the Endless Valley in search of Night Orchid Lilies, and witnessed a Thunder Falcon and two human Yuan Ying stage cultivators battling.</p><p>This demon's aura and cultivation were far inferior to the Thunder Falcon in its transformed state, but its appearance was strikingly similar.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that the Thunder Falcon had a young one, which she had even teased.</p><p>Could this be a reincarnated demon?</p><p>Confirming that it was only a mid-stage demon, relying on a magical artifact for disguise, and that it had been among the demons for quite some time—not as terrifying as she initially thought—Qin Sang felt relieved and quickly followed.</p><p>The concubine's chambers.</p><p>Light silk curtains, a jade dressing table.</p><p>At first glance, it looked like a human woman's bedroom.</p><p>In fact, the occupant of the chambers, the demon king's concubine, was indeed a female cultivator.</p><p>She was strikingly beautiful, but her talent was lacking, and she remained stuck at the False Core stage.  However, she was deeply favored by the Demon King, who had promised to do whatever it takes to help her break through the Core Formation bottleneck.</p><p>Her cultivation and background couldn't possibly challenge the Demon King's wife's position.</p><p>The concubine understood this perfectly, so she merely feigned anger, venting her frustration on the lesser demons, and didn't actually cause a disturbance at the birthday feast. At this moment, the concubine’s face was devoid of anger, as she was admiring herself in the mirror.</p><p>“Your Majesty, the King has sent your favorite celestial fruits and fine wine.”</p><p>The wolf’s voice came from outside.</p><p>“Insincere! Why didn't he deliver it himself?”</p><p>The concubine snorted, then swept her spiritual sense around, and seeing that it was the wolf, she opened the chamber's barrier.  “Leave it outside!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>…</p><p>Suddenly, the concubine sensed something amiss. Through the mirror, she was horrified to discover that the wolf had entered her chambers without her knowledge and was now behind her.</p><p>“How dare you!”</p><p>The concubine was shocked and enraged. Suddenly, her neck felt a chill as a silver chain tightened around it.</p><p>“Your Majesty, please don’t be alarmed. I know the King has given you many protective treasures, and if I’m too nervous and make a mistake, and you… perish, that wouldn't be good.”</p><p>The mist dissipated from the falcon, revealing its true form.</p><p>“What do you want! He abducted me; I don’t know anything!”</p><p>Seeing a strange falcon demon, the concubine was terrified and dared not move.</p><p>“I don’t need to ask you anything.”</p><p>The falcon said indifferently, then flicked a bolt of lightning from its fingertip.</p><p>The concubine's eyes rolled back, and she fainted.</p>
