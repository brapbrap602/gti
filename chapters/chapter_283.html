Chapter 276: Profound Mark Harmony Pill

"It's hard to guarantee it with just the two of us. In addition to Junior Brother Qin, I also invited a friend to help. He's already on his way to the ruins, and he should be here soon. If Junior Brother Qin is interested, we can leave immediately. After breaking the restriction, the main root of the Fire Earth Platanus will be yours, Junior Brother. My friend and I will split the Fire Platanus Liquid. How does that sound?"

It seemed that Yu Daiyue had already made his plans, going straight to the point with his distribution proposal.

The root system of the Fire Earth Platanus had one main root, which was the most refined piece of spiritual wood in the entire Fire Earth Platanus, of similar quality to Blackwood Camphor.

Its contents were not the most precious part of the Fire Earth Platanus, but rather the Fire Platanus Liquid that was bred in the hollow of the trunk. It was a rare spiritual medicine.

As a helper that accepted the invitation, if Qin Sang took the main root, it wouldn't be good to also divide the Fire Platanus Liquid, or it would be hard to convince the others.

After hearing what he said, Qin Sang did not immediately agree. Instead, he silently pondered.

If it wasn't for Cloud Wanderer's prior invitation, he wouldn't have needed to follow Yu Daiyue, but he was currently waiting to meet up with Cloud Wanderer. The agreed-upon time was just around the corner.

Going back and forth to ancient cultivator ruins would take at least two months.

Unfortunately, the two times overlapped!

Moreover, he had obtained Blackwood Camphor from the elder of the Earth Lacking Sect's possessions. His Green Ebony Sword had already swallowed and refined the Blackwood Camphor, completely satisfying the cultivation requirements. His demand for spiritual wood wasn't very urgent at the moment.

Compared to the Fire Earth Platanus, Qin Sang valued the medicine garden more.

Yu Daiyue's friend had already set off, and moreover, the Trial Space inside the ruins had collapsed. The stone tablet was exposed, making it much easier to enter the ancient ruins.

Those who went to search for treasure were no longer in the minority. The longer they delayed, the more dreams they might have. They definitely couldn't wait for him to finish his matters with the medicine garden.

He could not have both.

After considering his options, Qin Sang had no choice but to gently decline.

Yu Daiyue obviously did not expect to be refused. His face was full of surprise. "Junior Brother Qin, you don't see a spiritual tree like the Fire Earth Platanus everywhere. Will you reconsider?"

Qin Sang gave an affirmative, "yes" but said with some regret, "I won't lie to Senior Brother Yu. That matter is indeed very important to me. I can't miss it. Senior Brother Yu and your friend can't wait for me indefinitely. If the Fire Earth Platanus is taken first, I will become a sinner. If Senior Brother Yu needs more people, I can contact Senior Brother Mu Yifeng for you. Senior Brother Mu's power far surpasses mine. He will be more effective at breaking the restriction."

Yu Daiyue frowned deeply, then tried to persuade Qin Sang for a while longer. When he saw that Qin Sang's mind was made up, he shook his head with regret and stood up. "Pity. I heard that Junior Brother Qin has been in closed-door cultivation in his cave, so I thought you were free. I didn't expect it to be so untimely. It was my mistake to be presumptuous. In that case, I won't disturb you any longer."

Qin Sang originally planned to have Mu Yifeng split the main root of the Fire Earth Platanus and then buy it back from him.

It seemed that Yu Daiyue wasn't interested in this proposal.

When he sent Yu Daiyue out of the cave, Qin Sang added, "Senior Brother Yu, if you and your friend obtain the main root of the Fire Earth Platanus and are willing to part with it, you can consider me. I will definitely do my best to offer a price that satisfies you."

A trace of a smile came to Yu Daiyue's lips. "Of course I trust Junior Brother Qin's integrity. However, we haven't obtained anything yet. It's too early to talk about these things. Junior Brother Qin, please return!"

His light descended upon a snowy mountain peak.

Yu Daiyue stared at Qin Sang's cave that had already been closed. The smile on his face disappeared at some unknown time. His expression became very sullen.

After a few moments, Yu Daiyue summoned his light again and took off in a flash.

A faint snort that was nearly inaudible came from the mountaintop.

...

After seeing Yu Daiyue off, Qin Sang did not continue his meditation to cultivate. Instead, he took out a jade pendant.

The material of the jade pendant was the purest white jade.

He had received this jade pendant when Cloud Wanderer came to visit three months ago.

Qin Sang injected a trace of spiritual power into the jade pendant.

The next moment, a dazzling light shot out of the jade pendant, making his entire cave bright. Since Qin Sang had foreseen the dazzling light, he squinted slightly, gazing intently at the jade pendant.

The light of the jade pendant grew brighter and brighter, almost a milky white color, becoming unusually rich. Following that, the light changed, forming a round mirror-like surface directly above Qin Sang's palm.

There was a scene of a distant mountain in the mirror.

The mountain seemed to be surrounded by clouds and mist. Qin Sang couldn't tell whether it was because of the distance or some kind of restriction that prevented him from seeing it clearly.

He could only see a few rays of light that pierced through the clouds and mist, directly towards the sky, projected from the distant mountain's outline.

These rays of light emanated in differing colors, some vivid while some wan, which were not simple light but bore essence of energy, as if treasures were being revealed to the world. However, these were not manifestations of divine treasures but rather the dense medicinal efficacy of spiritual herbs reaching maturity.

Among them, there was a profound yellow essence that stood out in the top three.

Observing this profound yellow essence, Qin Sang recalled the words spoken by the Wandering Adept.

“Junior Brother Qin, the vision in the jade pendant isn’t particularly clear, but one can still discern a few details. The spiritual herb beneath this yellow light is most likely the Profound Patterned Purslane.

Junior Brother Qin may not know this, but the original name of the Rhyme Harmony Pill is the Profound Patterned Rhyme Harmony Pill. However, due to the absence of Profound Patterned Purslane, a main ingredient, it has always been impossible to refine.

Later, a senior attempted several times to alter a portion of the spiritual herbs in the pill recipe, using two other spiritual herbs to replace the Profound Patterned Purslane. He surprisingly refined an efficacious spiritual panacea with similar properties, whose medicinal effects were only marginally inferior to that of the Profound Patterned Rhyme Harmony Pill.

Due to the shortage of spiritual herbs in the immortal cultivation realm, such substitutions have become commonplace, of which most have ended in failure. However, there have been some which have even shown greater efficacy than the original pill recipe.

Lacking Profound Patterned Purslane, calling it the Profound Patterned Rhyme Harmony Pill would be a misnomer, thus the two words “Profound Patterned” were dropped, leaving only the Rhyme Harmony Pill.

However, the Profound Patterned Rhyme Harmony Pill has a unique property that the Rhyme Harmony Pill lacks, an attribute derived from the Profound Patterned Purslane.

If this spiritual herb is old enough, it can be refined to produce the Yellow Spirit Pill, which can elevate cultivation. Furthermore, the older the herb, the more pronounced its medicinal effects. It works best for Foundation Establishment cultivators, and the Profound Patterned Rhyme Harmony Pill has also inherited this attribute.

Therefore, even if the Profound Patterned Rhyme Harmony Pill cannot heal Junior Brother Qin’s concealed injuries, Junior Brother Qin need not worry about making a wasted trip. By refining the remaining medicinal efficacy, he can use it to elevate his cultivation, and at the very least, push Junior Brother Qin to the bottleneck of the middle stage of Foundation Establishment, saving him over a decade of bitter cultivation.”

The Wandering Adept paused and added with emphasis,

“The most valuable ingredient in the pill recipe for the Profound Patterned Rhyme Harmony Pill is Profound Patterned Purslane. Aside from that, the other ingredients are commonly found and can be bought in the Taiyi Pill Pavilion. Once Junior Brother Qin has gathered all the ingredients, this old man will gladly refine the pill for Junior Brother Qin, free of charge. Although this old man’s pill refining skills dare not compare to that of my esteemed fellow Martial Uncles, I can still guarantee seven to eight out of ten successes. Of course, if Junior Brother Qin is not reassured, this old man can also introduce you to a few fellow Martial Uncles. However, Junior Brother Qin must be mentally prepared—the compensation will certainly not be low.”
