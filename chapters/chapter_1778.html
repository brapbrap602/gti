<h1>Chapter 1769:  The Northern Palace, Southern Dipper Refining Talisman</h1><p>“Hundred-Knot Bamboo…”</p><p>Qin Sang memorized the name and expressed his thanks.</p><p>Master Lingxu nodded with a smile.</p><p>In fact, his trip to the Xuanji Gate was not for any important business, but rather a personal matter, to personally increase Qin Sang’s importance.</p><p>While unclear about what the True Person Cuiwei was planning, Master Lingxu could guess that removing that Daoist summons was not a good thing.</p><p>Under the rules set by the Daoist Court, those like Master Lingxu, unskilled in battle but expert in alchemy, received good protection, yet some things were unavoidable.</p><p>Master Lingxu’s great reputation stemmed from his extraordinary alchemic skills and his gentle nature, always kind to others.</p><p>Learning that the one who removed the summons was safe, Master Lingxu was happy for him, and now he was doing what he could as compensation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang produced such a unique alchemic formula, making Master Lingxu exclaim his trip was worthwhile.  He no longer felt only pity for Qin Sang, but a genuine desire to befriend him.</p><p>Qin Sang, unaware of this, also wanted to befriend this alchemic master.</p><p>Both sharing the same thoughts, their conversation was naturally pleasant.</p><p>By the time they reached Xuanji Gate, Master Lingxu was already calling Qin Sang “Brother Qingfeng.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Xuanji Gate is up there.”</p><p>Master Lingxu pointed upwards.</p><p>They were standing on a river, nearly a thousand miles wide, flowing eastward. It was said that this great river eventually flowed into the Star Island Immortal Lake in Jushan.</p><p>Hills rose and fell along the riverbank, the mountains resembling a celestial dragon.</p><p>Among the mountains, one peak stood out,鹤立鸡群 . While surrounding peaks were at most ten thousand feet high, this one was more than twice as tall.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his vision on the peak, seeing that above the halfway point, there was almost no vegetation, only sheer cliffs, as if carved by knives and axes, exceptionally dangerous.</p><p>A stone staircase had been carved on the side facing the river, but due to its danger, likely only cultivators would dare to traverse it.</p><p>At the summit, a thin mist floated, emitting a faint, crystalline light, like a layer of starlight, only vaguely revealing the silhouettes of pavilions within the mist.</p><p>Master Lingxu flew towards the summit, Qin Sang following closely behind.</p><p>Before reaching the top, a chime sounded, and the Xuanji Gate opened, with several cultivators emerging to greet them.</p><p>The leader was an acquaintance of Master Lingxu.</p><p>After inquiring about Qin Sang’s name, the cultivator said, “Master Lingxu, True Person Qingfeng, our Palace Master requests your presence.”</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a star pavilion. Master Lingxu laughed heartily, “Wonderful! Wonderful! It so happens that True Person Xingqiong has just left seclusion.  I was worried that a sudden visit might disturb her cultivation.”</p><p>A woman’s voice came from within the pavilion, “I had planned to return to seclusion yesterday. However, Master Lingxu’s reputation is too resounding.  The two of you arrived at the Sanyuan River last night and were recognized by the soldiers under the command of the Dragon King…”</p><p>As the voice spoke, Qin Sang saw a Daoist nun descending from the star pavilion, her cultivation comparable to Master Lingxu's, also in the early stage of Transformation God.</p><p>The nun didn't appear young, and her features weren't exquisitely beautiful, but her brows held an authority others lacked.</p><p>Seeing the nun, the Xuanji Gate cultivators bowed, “Greetings, Palace Master.”</p><p>This woman was True Person Xingqiong, the Xuanji Gate's Palace Master. She dismissed her disciples, gesturing with a graceful hand towards the star pavilion, “Please, honored guests.”</p><p>“Mere reputation, not worth mentioning.”</p><p>Master Lingxu shook his head slightly, inviting Qin Sang into the star pavilion.</p><p>After they settled, Master Lingxu made some polite conversation before getting to the point, “My visit is to request something of you, True Person.”</p><p>He pointed to Qin Sang, “I owe Brother Qingfeng a favor, promising to help him with something. Unfortunately, his request is not related to alchemy, so I must boldly ask for your assistance.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>True Person Xingqiong looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>She had secretly observed Qin Sang earlier, sensing his abundant Qi and blood, suggesting a strong cultivator of the Dragon Tiger Hall. However, his aura was rather elusive, making it difficult to see through.  Further investigation would be too impolite, so she secretly speculated about Qin Sang's identity.</p><p>“What does True Person Qingfeng desire? Our sect has received many favors from Master Lingxu. If this Palace can help you both, we will do so without hesitation.”</p><p>Master Lingxu stroked his beard and smiled.</p><p>With Master Lingxu’s nod, Qin Sang rose and bowed, “I wish to request a talisman from you, True Person—the Northern Palace, Southern Dipper Refining Talisman!”</p><p>“That talisman?”</p><p>True Person Xingqiong frowned slightly, “True Person Qingfeng should know that the Northern Palace, Southern Dipper Refining Talisman has no offensive capabilities. It’s a talisman for praying for good fortune and refining forms. It is unlikely to be effective for those outside our Xuanji Gate, and may even backfire.”</p><p>Furthermore, since this talisman requires such a high level of skill, and my cultivation is still insufficient, the chance of successfully creating it is low, and our sect currently does not possess any such treasured items.”</p><p>Talismans and spiritual amulets in Daoist sects are sometimes interchangeable. Some talismans can be made into spiritual amulets, but they are all extremely valuable.</p><p>“I understand! I’m cultivating a secret technique that requires external assistance. I had a sudden idea and recalled your sect's Northern Palace Southern Dipper refining of talismans. Regardless of whether it's effective, I will bear all consequences...I wonder if I could ask the Real Person to personally use their divine powers?”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly explained his intentions.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Real Person Xing Qiong hesitated, glancing at Master Lingxu before saying after a moment, “I am currently cultivating a Daoist technique and need to retreat for about two years.  Can Real Person Qingfeng wait?”</p><p>“I can! I can!”</p><p>Unexpectedly successful, Qin Sang was overjoyed and repeatedly thanked them.</p><p>There was nothing more for him to do. Qin Sang tactfully withdrew, led by a Xuanji Sect cultivator to a guest house to rest.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang and Master Lingxu left Xuanji Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang had made an appointment with Real Person Xing Qiong to meet again at Gu Shan Zhixing Valley in two years. He had originally planned to wait at Xuanji Sect, but considering he might need to do some preparations before the Star Yuan Infusion, he decided to return early.</p><p>After seeing Master Lingxu to his residence, Qin Sang did not stay long and took his leave.</p><p>Back at Heming Mountain, Qin Sang consolidated his cultivation while preparing for his upcoming breakthrough.  His remaining merit was almost depleted.</p><p>As the appointed time approached, Qin Sang left Heming Mountain alone and headed straight for Xing Valley.</p><p>Compared to twenty years ago, Xing Valley had not changed much.</p><p>Returning to the underground cavern, Qin Sang carefully searched the underground river, but found no trace left by the Sword-Wielding Real Person.</p><p>Over the past twenty years, Qin Sang had been in seclusion, cultivating diligently, and hadn’t seen the Sword-Wielding Real Person again. He received a letter from the latter through Real Person Gu Zhou, containing only greetings and an invitation to visit Star Island's Immortal Lake.</p><p>Difficult to refuse.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, “If this breakthrough is successful, I might as well visit Star Island’s Immortal Lake and pay my respects to the Sword-Wielding Real Person.”</p><p>While pondering, Qin Sang began making preparations in Xing Valley.</p><p>One after another, refined star essence stones flew in all directions, forming a large array encompassing the entire valley.  Qin Sang would break through within the array, so that even if something unexpected happened, it could provide some protection.</p><p>Incidentally, he learned this array from his senior sister.</p><p>Thinking of his senior sister, Qin Sang fell into a trance.</p><p>During his years in this unexpected realm, Qin Sang had deliberately avoided thinking about those old friends.</p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang let out an almost inaudible sigh, put aside his distractions, and continued his work.</p><p>…</p><p>The appointed day finally arrived.</p><p>That morning, Qin Sang stopped cultivating and waited until noon. Finally, he sensed a familiar aura, unmistakable, flying towards him.</p><p>He darted out of Xing Valley and saw two streams of light approaching in the distance – Real Person Xing Qiong and Real Person Fuji, who had greeted him at Xuanji Sect.</p><p>“Real Person Qingfeng, you’ve been waiting a long time.”</p><p>Real Person Xing Qiong landed before Qin Sang.</p><p>“It's just that the place I chose was too secluded,” Qin Sang chuckled, inviting them into Xing Valley.</p><p>Sensing the abundant star essence energy within Xing Valley, Real Person Xing Qiong nodded knowingly, “Real Person has chosen a treasure land.”</p><p>Real Person Fuji, who followed behind, glanced over Xing Valley, his eyes lighting up, “This array is quite good.”</p><p>“I’m not skilled in formations, this is a rough attempt, and I still have many uncertainties. I would like to ask for Real Person’s guidance.”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately produced a blank jade slip and inscribed the array onto it.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Real Person Fuji hesitated, looking at the sect leader.</p><p>Real Person Xing Qiong smiled slightly, “Real Person Qingfeng, don’t worry. Since it is Master Lingxu’s request, I will do my utmost.”</p><p>“Thank you, Real Person!”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed respectfully.</p><p>…</p><p>Late at night.</p><p>Happily, the night was moonless, the stars filled the sky, and the Milky Way was exceptionally brilliant.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a stone platform at the bottom of Xing Valley.</p><p>The two Real Persons from Xuanji Sect stood atop the eastern peak.</p><p>They had discussed the details during the day. Real Person Xing Qiong observed the celestial timing, nodded to Real Person Fuji.</p><p>Real Person Fuji leaped outwards, summoning a ritual altar. The seal on the altar differed from the “Announce to All Spirits Seal” of the Tian Shu Academy; it was a scroll depicting the Big Dipper, with the first four stars particularly bright.</p><p>The altar opened two gates.</p><p>At Real Person Fuji's command, the troops were divided into four teams, flying in four directions, mainly guarding the east – the direction of Gui Fang.</p><p>Simultaneously, Real Person Xing Qiong, having ascended to the air at some point, also summoned a ritual altar and summoned his troops.</p><p>In an instant, baleful energy soared into the sky, and flags obscured the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang below in Xing Valley’s expression shifted slightly. He could sense that while Real Person Xing Qiong did not have transformed Divine Transformation stage demonic beasts among his followers, he had two late-stage transformed demon commanders leading the troops.</p><p>Moreover, by merely using a talisman, Real Person Xing Qiong might not have displayed his full strength.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly at the profound cultivation base of the sects in this realm, realizing that even the powerful Xuanji Sect had to rely on Daoting for support.</p><p>Suddenly, a surge of true energy rippled through the air above.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression turned serious.  He dismissed distracting thoughts and waited quietly.</p><p>Troops were deployed, surrounding True Person Xing Qiong.  Their commanders waved their spiritual flags, and the soldiers instantly shifted formations, creating a complex array whose energy was completely unified.</p><p>True Person Xing Qiong stood on the altar, performing ritualistic steps and gestures. Her eyes were deep and starlike.</p><p>She raised her right hand and lightly touched the void.</p><p>The  Big Dipper chart on the altar trembled slightly, emitting a beam of light seemingly containing a talismanic image that merged into True Person Xing Qiong's fingertip.</p><p>As her fingertip moved, incredibly complex runes appeared in the void.</p><p>“Majestic Star Palace, true celestials of the Milky Way.</p><p>Gather the essence of the Northern Palace, stars falling from the Southern Dipper.</p><p>Haste!”</p><p>At that moment, all living beings within a thousand li of Xing Valley felt a stirring in their hearts.  Looking up, they witnessed a spectacular sight.</p><p>The Milky Way, illuminating the heavens, shone with an unprecedented brilliance, its stars bursting forth with radiant light.</p><p>The Milky Way then began to flow, the starlight seemingly drawn together toward the Big Dipper!</p><p>Instantly, the seven stars of the Big Dipper stood out from the myriad stars of the Milky Way.</p><p>The seven stars connected.</p><p>Then, the starlight from the Milky Way surged forth, causing the Big Dipper to become even more dazzling as the starlight poured in.</p><p>The next moment, the sky seemed to tremble. The seven interconnected stars formed a vast stellar bow, launching all the gathered stellar energy towards the Southern Dipper.</p><p>A stellar arrow, visible to the naked eye, streaked across the heavens, piercing the star sea and approaching the Southern Dipper.</p><p>The six stars of the Southern Dipper reacted, absorbing all the starlight before blazing brilliantly, showering starlight from the heavens!</p><p>True Person Xing Qiong's eyes gleamed.  She pointed downwards at Qin Sang.</p><p>A torrent of immense stellar energy, like a surging river, crashed down into Xing Valley, instantly engulfing Qin Sang.</p><p>The influx of starlight triggered a transformation in Xing Valley.</p><p>The accumulated stellar energy within Xing Valley was mobilized, frantically rushing toward Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was bathed in starlight, surrounded by a thick concentration of stellar energy.</p><p>The celestial phenomena gradually faded, while the light in Xing Valley grew increasingly brilliant, illuminating the surrounding Purple Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Then, luminous points rose within Xing Valley, connecting to form a large net that covered the entire valley, sealing the starlight.</p><p>Everything seemed to return to normal.</p><p>True Person Xing Qiong put away the altar, glanced at the sealed Xing Valley, and said to True Person Fu Ji, who had rushed over, "Let's go."</p><p>Their mission was to complete True Person Ling Xu's request. Whether Qin Sang succeeded or not was none of their concern, nor did they have an obligation to protect him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t expect them to protect him, so he directly sealed Xing Valley with a powerful formation.</p><p>True Person Fu Ji responded and left, frequently looking back, curious about whether Qin Sang would succeed.  Such a grand display implied an extraordinary power.</p><p>He couldn't imagine that someone could use the Northern and Southern Dippers to refine talismans and achieve a breakthrough.</p><p>Inside Xing Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang, single-minded, focused on his cultivation technique.  The ethereal and mysterious stellar energy poured into his body from the top of his head.</p><p>His skin instantly turned blood-red, threatening to bleed at any moment.</p><p>Familiar pain struck; his flesh, bones, and marrow felt like they were being torn apart.</p><p>The stronger his body, the more difficult the breaking and rebuilding process became. Qin Sang's physique was now far beyond what it had been; even now, undergoing stellar energy infusion again, he suffered terrible agony.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was already accustomed to this.  His only fear was that the stellar energy might not be sufficient!</p><p>Qin Sang's body seemed like a bottomless pit, constantly absorbing all the stellar energy. The stellar energy gathered into a torrent, repeatedly washing over Qin Sang's body.</p><p>Blood was replaced, bones refined, and sinews tempered.</p><p>Force cultivators achieve the ultimate refinement of their bodies through repeated cleansing and transformation.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Phoenix wings manifested on Qin Sang’s back.</p><p>Then, the Qingluan Dharma Image appeared above his head.  The Dharma Image flickered faintly, seemingly undergoing its own transformation.</p><p>His spiritual awareness and realm had already advanced, laying a solid foundation for this breakthrough.  However, Qin Sang's biggest concern was that, not being a descendant of the Heavenly Yao, he might repeat his previous failure.</p><p>Thankfully, his fears proved unfounded!</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Thunder echoed repeatedly within Qin Sang's body, making him want to roar to the heavens. His blood energy solidified into a beam of blood light that shot towards the stars, only to be blocked by the formation.</p><p>Finally, his aura seemed to cross a certain threshold, suddenly surging.</p><p>Breakthrough!</p><p></p>
