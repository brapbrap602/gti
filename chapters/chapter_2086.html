<h1>Chapter 2077 A Letter</h1><p>“Greetings, Master Uncle.”</p><p>“Greetings, Master Huan…”</p><p>…</p><p>Huan Hen landed before the palace, his遁光  fading.  Dressed in close-fitting attire, his long hair bound, a long sword at his back, his bearing was elegant, his eyes sharp as a hawk’s, like a wandering swordsman.  His sword remained sheathed—a special sword-nurturing technique.</p><p>The disciples of the Green Sheep Temple bowed respectfully, their faces filled with awe.  They showed similar respect to Li Yu Fu and Shen Chen, but the nature of their awe differed.  Their fear of Huan Hen far outweighed their respect; anyone who had witnessed his exploits on the battlefield would feel a chilling dread.</p><p>In the Storm Realm, Huan Hen’s reputation was as formidable as that of the Temple Master, Li Yu Fu, and the leader of the Celestial Crafts Alliance, Shen Chen.  He adhered to the Way of the Killing Sword, thriving in the chaos of battle. He always charged into the enemy ranks first, his sword flashing, limbs and blood spraying as lives were extinguished in an instant, leaving behind a trail of corpses, his expression unchanged.  Both foe and ally would be terrified by the sight.  Countless fell beneath his blade; he was a warrior forged in blood.</p><p>The disciples were utterly respectful, not daring to breathe, their heads bowed, avoiding Huan Hen’s gaze.  Huan Hen was aware of his reputation but had no intention of changing it. This was his path, and he didn't care about others' opinions.  If his enemies were intimidated before a battle, that was even better.</p><p>His expression cold, he merely grunted, “Hmm,” and walked past them, his demeanor aloof.  If they weren’t fellow disciples, he wouldn't even bother responding, but this very indifference reassured them. Even the Green Sheep Temple disciples felt immense pressure in his presence. If Huan Hen were to suddenly become amiable and offer kind instruction like other masters, they would be far more apprehensive.</p><p>Huan Hen subdued his sword intent and approached the palace gates, about to activate the protective barrier to see the Temple Master, when a flash of light emanated from his belt pendant. He paused, slightly surprised, then vanished in a blur.</p><p>After Huan Hen's departure, the disciples visibly relaxed, but dared not discuss their master, dispersing quietly.</p><p>Meanwhile, Huan Hen landed on a nearby peak, its height comparable to the main peak where the palace stood. However, a large formation concealed a structure near the summit, making it appear as an ordinary mountain from afar.  The summit had been leveled to create a platform for future sparring matches among the Green Sheep Temple disciples.</p><p>Two figures stood on the platform: Shen Chen and Sword Slave.</p><p>“Shen Shixiong, are you well?”</p><p>Huan Hen landed and bowed respectfully to Shen Chen. He was a disciple of Shangguan Li Feng; Qin Sang and Shangguan Li Feng being of equal standing, Li Yu Fu had accepted him as a junior brother.  However, after Shangguan Li Feng’s death, both Li Yu Fu and Shen Chen had guided Huan Hen extensively, and though addressed as senior brothers, Huan Hen always treated them with the utmost respect.</p><p>After bowing, Huan Hen turned to Sword Slave, having noticed him upon arrival.  Sword Slave stood motionless, with no detectable aura, like an ordinary person. Yet, Huan Hen sensed a unique quality about him, immediately recognizing him as a fellow swordsman!</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Huan Hen’s eyes. This person was unfathomable, his cultivation seemingly surpassing his own. When did such a powerful swordsman appear in the Storm Realm?</p><p>Because the amount of Azure Spirit Qi was limited, its distribution required careful consideration, assessing each individual's talent, character, and potential for breakthrough.  The vast majority of the Storm Realm’s Transcendent Ascension cultivators achieved their breakthroughs with the aid of Azure Spirit Qi, benefiting from it and bound by its consequences. All of them had appeared on the battlefield and were well-known; their achievements were impossible to hide.</p><p>Of course, there was a possibility of some quietly achieving breakthroughs, fearing the Changyou Tribe and remaining hidden. Not everyone prioritized the greater good; in any situation, some would inevitably harbor ulterior motives.</p><p>Huan Hen didn't care about Sword Slave's origins. His instinctive reaction was that he'd finally met a peerless expert, someone to test his swordsmanship against. His sword hummed in response.</p><p>Sensing Huan Hen's fighting spirit, Shen Chen smiled.  “You haven't paid your respects to Senior Sword Slave yet!”</p><p>Although he and Sword Slave were both at the Transcendent Ascension realm, Qin Sang addressed him as “Dao You”  and treated him with exceptional respect, hence the title of senior.</p><p>Unless Tian Yue Shang Ren had specific instructions, Sword Slave didn't concern himself with formalities or offer explanations.</p><p>Hearing the name "Sword Slave," Shen Chen was slightly surprised.  Who would choose such a self-deprecating title?</p><p>But to Huan Hen, the name held a deeper meaning.</p><p>Self-proclaimed Sword Servant, his heart surely holds only the sword; a pure sword cultivator!</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Sword Servant!”</p><p>A glint flashed in Huan Hen’s eyes, his fighting spirit undiminished but intensified. He was like a drawn sword, ready to strike.</p><p>Shen Chen understood his junior brother’s temperament and anticipated this. He turned to the Sword Servant, “Senior Sword Servant, this…”</p><p>The Sword Servant readily agreed, “I was about to have a friendly sparring match with young friend Huan Hen on swordsmanship!”</p><p>Shen Chen nodded, leaped off the arena, and landed on the viewing platform beside it, fully activating the arena’s protective array.</p><p>Only the Sword Servant and Huan Hen remained on the stage.</p><p>Ten meters apart, they faced each other.</p><p>Huan Hen, in battle attire, carried a spiritual sword on his back. The sword vibrated repeatedly, its ringing echoing, seemingly eager to fight for its master.  Its sound fueled his momentum, rising steadily, merging with his sword intent, his sharpness ever increasing.</p><p>In contrast, the Sword Servant, clad in black, stood with his feet slightly apart, arms hanging naturally. His sword was nowhere to be seen.  His eyes were somewhat cloudy, lacking sharpness. He looked at Huan Hen calmly, like a seasoned elder observing a greenhorn.</p><p>‘Buzz…buzz…buzz…’</p><p>The ringing of the sword filled the arena.</p><p>Suddenly, Huan Hen’s eyes widened slightly; his momentum peaked, and the ringing ceased.</p><p>With a ‘clang’, his spiritual sword left its sheath, a flash of light like a tranquil autumn lake, striking and dazzling.</p><p>At that moment, Shen Chen, watching from the viewing platform, abruptly stood up, his face filled with shock.</p><p>The sword light dimmed. The spiritual sword, never leaving Huan Hen’s back, had only been halfway drawn from its sheath before stopping.</p><p>The spiritual sword remained sheathed, Huan Hen stood motionless, his gaze fixed ahead.  There was a sword there, its tip aimed at his forehead, less than three inches away!</p><p>The moment he was about to draw his sword, an immense sense of danger overwhelmed him. Before he could counterattack, the sword appeared before him.</p><p>Huan Hen had no defensive treasures, only his sword and the ever-present sword intent surrounding him, his proudest defense. His sword intent formed an impenetrable barrier, capable of withstanding any attack.  Any attack that approached would be met with the sharpest counterattack, faster and more reliable than any defensive treasure.</p><p>But against the Sword Servant, the sword intent barrier failed. The sword easily pierced it, appearing before him abruptly, his protective sword intent unreactive, or perhaps too slow to react.</p><p>If the Sword Servant hadn't shown mercy, the sword might have pierced his forehead, piercing his skull.</p><p>Huan Hen knew it was the Sword Servant's sword, but hadn't seen when he drew it, or what sword technique he used.</p><p>Huan Hen tried to find reasons. If it weren't a friendly match, and the Sword Servant hadn't stopped, he could have defended himself, he wouldn't have been so helpless.  But Huan Hen replayed the events repeatedly, reaching the same conclusion: he might have blocked the first strike, but highly doubted he could block a second!</p><p>Battles between Transcendence cultivators involved a clash of heavenly might; those with higher cultivation could suppress their opponents with it.</p><p>Huan Hen knew his cultivation was inferior to the Sword Servant's, and was prepared for it, but the other party hadn't used any heavenly might.</p><p>It was a fair duel, and he lost; he lost utterly.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The spiritual sword returned to its sheath. Huan Hen bowed his head, "I lose."</p><p>The shock in Shen Chen's eyes hadn't subsided. Huan Hen was certainly no match for the Sword Servant, but he hadn't expected the battle to end so quickly, Huan Hen unable to withstand even a single strike.</p><p>No wonder Master valued the Sword Servant so highly!</p><p>Shen Chen even wondered if the Glass Fairy and the Chief of the Changyou Clan were the Sword Servant’s match.</p><p>As he was about to fly to the arena, a figure appeared beside him – Li Yu Fu.</p><p>“Senior Brother…”</p><p>“I saw it,” Li Yu Fu nodded, his eyes shining with excitement. He exclaimed, “Indeed, there are no ordinary people around Master!”</p><p>Shen Chen agreed wholeheartedly.</p><p>The two landed on the arena, bowing to the Sword Servant before turning to Huan Hen.</p><p>Huan Hen hadn't noticed their arrival; he stood motionless, his spiritual sword already retrieved by the Sword Servant.  His gaze was downcast, seemingly replaying the battle, lost in thought, his sword intent rippling.</p><p>Seeing his apparent insight, the Sword Servant nodded subtly.  A promising talent.</p><p>After a while, Huan Hen came to his senses. Seeing Li Yu Fu, he quickly bowed, "Greetings, Overseer, this junior was rude."</p><p>Li Yu Fu smiled and nodded, bowing respectfully to the sword servant.  "Brother Huan Hen wholeheartedly pursues the sword path, yet lacks a master.  Could you, senior, offer some guidance? We would be eternally grateful!"</p><p>Huan Hen's eyes shone with eagerness. He believed the sword path should be pursued relentlessly, but not blindly.  Any strong sword cultivator was his teacher.</p><p>The sword servant glanced at Huan Hen, then turned and walked towards the edge of the arena. "If you wish to learn the sword, follow me."</p><p>"Thank you for your guidance, senior!"</p><p>Huan Hen bowed deeply and quickly followed.</p><p>Watching them leave, Shen Chen sighed and turned to Li Yu Fu. "Master is in seclusion?  Does he have any other instructions?"</p><p>Li Yu Fu nodded, his lips moving slightly as he transmitted a message.</p><p>Shen Chen's expression became serious; he nodded repeatedly.</p><p>…</p><p>South of Zhongzhou, slightly westward, the sea holds countless islands, home to the Changyou people.  The islands are regularly spaced, some forming chains, allowing the Changyou to establish a strong defensive line.</p><p>Previously, beasts from the Foul Lands would occasionally appear, usually just one at a time, causing little damage.  Nearby Changyou experts could easily kill them.</p><p>Then came the beast horde attack, inflicting heavy losses on the Changyou. The discovery of the Storm Realm afterward led to the Changyou establishing their main force here.</p><p>The Storm Realm has launched several counterattacks, pushing the Changyou back to their islands, but they are always driven back. The battlefield has seesawed back and forth between the two areas. Now, the Changyou are ascendant, having also taken the Western Wastelands.</p><p>Beyond the first island chain lie two more similar groups of islands. The Changyou can retreat further; their defensive depth far surpasses that of the Storm Realm.</p><p>The islanders suffered countless casualties during the beast attacks, but have gradually recovered after centuries of rebuilding.</p><p>Beyond the three island chains lies a vast continent, the wealthiest and most important Changyou territory, home to the most influential families and the Ancestral Sacred Hall.</p><p>The Ancestral Sacred Hall is the most important sacred site for every supernatural tribe. It houses ancestral shrines; the people believe that only through devout worship will their ancestors guide them on the path to enlightenment.</p><p>This continent is called Sheng Mu Yuan. Legend says the Changyou ancestors bathed in a sacred lake there.</p><p>Sheng Mu Yuan has countless rivers, lakes and ponds; rainfall is abundant. Over 60% is water; the remainder consists of swamps, wetlands, and rainforests.  Truly dry land is scarce. Water divides the land into separate sections; viewed from above, it resembles a sea of islands.</p><p>This is precisely the environment the Changyou prefer. They possess innate water-controlling abilities and even the ordinary people are naturally fond of water.</p><p>The sacred lake is the Changyou's holiest site, with the Ancestral Sacred Hall built in its center.</p><p>The Changyou chieftain and elders are responsible for guarding the Ancestral Sacred Hall and rarely leave the sacred lake except in times of great importance.</p><p>The chieftain's residence is by the sacred lake; he is currently in seclusion there.</p><p>In a quiet chamber, an oil lamp burns steadily.</p><p>The Changyou chieftain sits cross-legged beneath it.  A wisp of white smoke from the lamp is inhaled into his nostrils.</p><p>The lamp oil is a special spiritual item, emitting a calming fragrance when burned, aiding cultivation. It is a rare treasure among the Changyou, only accessible to the chieftain and elders.</p><p>The Zhu Yan and their subordinate tribes are known for their martial prowess and strong physiques, and the Changyou are no exception; most are tall and strong.</p><p>This chieftain, however, is short and thin, only half the height of a normal Changyou. His cheeks are sunken, making his pointed mouth and small eyes stand out. His four ears, however, are unusually large, giving him a peculiar appearance.</p><p>During his meditation, the Changyou chieftain's ears twitched slightly. He suddenly opened his eyes, and the chamber seemed to brighten momentarily.</p><p>The chamber's protective barriers were triggered by someone outside. The Changyou chieftain sensed it was his favored third son. He had given instructions before entering seclusion; no one else dared disturb him.</p><p>His brow furrowed, he demanded, "What is it?!"</p><p>"Father!"</p><p>His son's voice was panicked, as if he had encountered something terrifying. "Someone asked me to deliver a letter to you, Father, and said they would be waiting outside the sacred grounds!"</p><p>The Changyou chieftain's eyes narrowed. His son also possessed Void Realm cultivation. What kind of person could cause such panic, forcing him to disregard his cultivation to deliver a letter?</p><p>The chamber door silently opened a crack.</p><p>The chieftain's son held out a sealed letter, then felt it lighten as it flew into the chamber.</p><p>The Changyou chieftain opened the letter, glanced at it, and his expression changed drastically.</p><p>He slowly rose, his expression shifting between doubt and determination, before settling into calm.  Exiting the chamber, he addressed his third son, who stood respectfully waiting.  "Keep this a secret."</p><p>His son trembled. "Yes, Father!"</p>
