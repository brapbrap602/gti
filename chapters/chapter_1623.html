<h1>Chapter 1614: Yan Yue Temple</h1><p>Tenglong Cliff.</p><p>The altar and the Five-Phase Order shone brightly.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The Five-Phase Order was unstable, giving the illusion that it might be thrown off at any moment.  The altar itself shook incessantly; while the movement seemed small, it held astonishing force.</p><p>The five practitioners rotated with the altar, their palms firmly pressed against its edge, enduring the tremendous vibrations, not daring to move an inch.  Despite their top-tier cultivation, the constant recoil from the altar was becoming unbearable, threatening to force them to lose their grip or even cause injuries.</p><p>Here, the difference in their lineages became apparent.</p><p>Su Zinan and the Swordsman were not disciples of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>A blood talisman spontaneously flew from Su Zinan's pouch, exploding with a ‘bang’ to reveal a bloody apparition.  The apparition’s features were contorted, emitting a pained shriek that unsettled the minds of those who heard it—clearly an evil entity.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The apparition turned to attack Su Zinan.</p><p>Su Zinan neither dodged nor evaded, merging with the apparition. A wave of blood washed over his face before fading, leaving him looking as before but with greatly increased power; the trembling in his arms lessened considerably as he pressed firmly onto the altar.</p><p>The Swordsman bowed his head slightly, silently chanting sword incantations.  His heavy sword behind him trembled, its hum like a dragon's roar before suddenly unsheathing.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The long sword flew through the air.</p><p>A blinding blade energy soared into the heavens!</p><p>The sword itself was invisible, only the dazzling blade light, like a crescent moon, flashed towards the space between the Swordsman's hands.  The tip silently pressed against the altar, sharing the recoil force for its master.</p><p>The other three had varying degrees of connection to the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>The white-robed man's robes billowed.  It turned out that the robes weren't purely white; intricate patterns were visible, revealing a miniature world of swirling snow inside.  Visible pale, icy winds surged forth, gathering around the white-robed man. The cold air accumulated behind him, gradually forming an ice mirror. The mirror hung behind his head, its surface reflecting the altar, shimmering with frosty light.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man slightly trembled.  From his shoulders, his arms petrified, turning into two pieces of dead wood, his fingers withered like branches, gripping the altar tightly, ensuring he would not let go.</p><p>Zhu Wudao was the mastermind, but Su Zinan had yet to see him make a move.  From the corner of his eye, through the glow of the Five-Phase Order, he observed Zhu Wudao without showing any emotion.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhu Wudao simply changed his eyes to a pale gold; his gaze, tangible as if solid, fixed on the altar.  There were no further movements.  He didn't appear to use any magical arts, yet he stabilized the situation.</p><p>He was the most relaxed of the five.</p><p>The five practitioners jointly stabilized the altar, then looked upwards simultaneously.</p><p>The Five-Phase Order emitted five-colored beams of light.</p><p>In the center of the beams, the white light had grown much larger than before, forming a sphere the size of a person's head. Its strange fluctuations grew increasingly violent. This fluctuation was the source of the tremors.  Waves of light surged within the sphere, each surge bringing a powerful tremor. This tremor didn't just affect the altar; it acted upon the entire space, shaking the earth. The peaks of Taiyue Sect trembled, rocks tumbling down.</p><p>On the main peak,</p><p>Both sides ceased fighting, all eyes drawn to the six beams of light that shot into the sky.</p><p>Gold, green, blue, red, yellow!</p><p>Five beams of light, nearly identical in scale, surrounded the white beam. Initially, the white beam was smaller, but as the tremors intensified, the white light became increasingly dazzling, gradually catching up.</p><p>Under the influence of the tremors, the main peak swayed the most violently. Lower-level disciples needed to use their cultivation techniques to maintain their footing, utterly astonished.</p><p>"There!"</p><p>"What is that?"</p><p>Someone pointed at the sphere, shouting.</p><p>Hua Chenzi rebuked, "Hurry and regulate your breath!"</p><p>The disciples were startled, remembering their predicament—escaping danger was their priority.  Having been continuously attacked by the invaders, they were exhausted, quickly silencing their thoughts to gather strength.</p><p>The beams of light shot into the black sky.</p><p>In the sky, dark clouds gathered here, trapping the beams.</p><p>Otherwise, the phenomenon would be visible for miles, and the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, not yet revealed to the world, would have its secrets spread with alarming speed, becoming known to various forces.</p><p>After several hours, the five-colored beams stabilized, only the white beam continued to expand.</p><p>The sphere gradually inflated, its interior seeming to be a deep passage, chaotic and filled with multicolored, twisted light, imbued with the power of chaos.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>These beams of light, of unknown origin, collided and exploded continuously.  The power of the spirit formation and the restrictions reached an extreme level, even mixing with spatial turbulence.</p><p>Su Zinan and his companions stood close to the orb, their expressions grave as they witnessed the scene within.  Even they couldn't guarantee their safety if caught in its pull.</p><p>"We must enter the Wuxiang Immortal Gate through here?"</p><p>Su Zinan's brow furrowed, sensing great danger.</p><p>"The great upheaval back then came suddenly. Our ancestors, unprepared, forcibly sealed the Wuxiang Immortal Gate, causing spatial turbulence and chaos. We have no other choice but to force our way in. But don't worry, everyone. Once the passage stabilizes and the immortal abode emerges, we'll have more room to maneuver."</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao said, looking up to confirm the anomaly was contained by the Mutian Xuan array, then nodded silently.</p><p>Though subtle, the disturbance caused by the Wuxiang Immortal Gate's emergence intensified, gradually overwhelming the Mutian Xuan array. The tremors reached the Taiyue Gate.</p><p>Some time after the passage opened.</p><p>On a distant mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the fluctuations, awakening from his meditative state.</p><p>"Finally!"</p><p>He dismissed the Sun God Tree, leaving his cave dwelling, concealing his presence, and stopping a distance from the Taiyue Gate.</p><p>From his vantage point.</p><p>Everything at Taiyue Gate appeared normal.</p><p>But Qin Sang knew it was an illusion; a drastic change had occurred within!</p><p>"Sealing a top-tier sect… what a grand scheme!"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.  Worried about counter-measures against probing, he refrained from using his Sky-Eyed Butterfly to spy, choosing to wait and see.</p><p>Remaining hidden, he searched elsewhere, but found no trace of Zi Lei Zhenren, unsure if Gui Mu's assessment was correct, but erring on the side of caution.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>The orb vanished.</p><p>Over those two days, the orb slowly ascended, the power within the passage becoming manifest.  A spatial vortex appeared above Taiyue Gate.</p><p>The vortex's range already covered a significant portion of Taiyue Gate, its terrifying power threatening imminent destruction and inducing a bone-chilling pressure.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>A deafening thunderclap shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>Everyone looked up in shock. The passage had contacted the black veil, and the edge of the turbulent flow finally collided with the Mutian Xuan array.</p><p>Instantly.</p><p>Turbulence filled the sky, tearing the black veil.</p><p>The clash of forces created a storm engulfing Taiyue Gate.</p><p>Trees were uprooted, halls collapsed, the ground trembled, and Taiyue Gate's main peak threatened to topple – utter devastation.</p><p>Finally, the black veil shattered completely!</p><p>At this point, Zhu Wu Dao could no longer contain the anomaly.  Strange lights shot towards the heavens, spatial fluctuations erupted, and the celestial phenomena drastically changed.</p><p>However, this was within Zhu Wu Dao's expectations.</p><p>Everything proceeded as planned.  Top experts from various中原 sects had gathered in Jinyu Prefecture. Even if they received news and rushed here, they wouldn't be able to stop them.</p><p>The vortex expanded faster.</p><p>Through the vortex and passage, glimpses of mirage-like scenes appeared occasionally – a mountain range, a building, a forest – clearly projections from within the Wuxiang Immortal Gate.</p><p>This proved the Wuxiang Immortal Gate was intact and preserved!</p><p>Then, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The altar violently shook, threatening to destabilize the assembled cultivators, particularly the two imitation Five-Phase Tokens, which clattered, on the verge of collapse.</p><p>This unexpected event could ruin everything.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's face paled, letting out a long howl.</p><p>The anomaly had appeared; there was no need to seal Taiyue Gate anymore.</p><p>Hearing the howl, Mo Xing Dao and the others immediately retreated, converging around the altar, displaying their respective abilities.</p><p>…</p><p>At the northern foot of Taiyue Gate.</p><p>Yue Lingtian returned, entering the valley to rendezvous with Zi Lei Zhenren.</p><p>They hid there, gazing at the sky.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren searched for Zhu Wu Dao and his group.</p><p>…</p><p>West of the mountain gate.</p><p>Qin Sang stood beneath a tree, waiting patiently, intently observing the celestial phenomena. His brow flickered, summoning his external avatar.</p><p>…</p><p>Southeast of Taiyue Gate, in the wilderness near Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>A figure hid within a swirling mist, moving erratically through the woods, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>As the anomaly appeared.</p><p>The figure abruptly stopped, looking up, revealing a pale face – Fan Laomo, the Grand Elder of Tianhao Tower.</p><p>Pale and beardless, his face devoid of blood, his aura icy, he was first astonished, then, remembering something, his expression shifted to one of surprise and delight.  "Zhu Laogui, I wondered why your Quyang Mountain lineage had been so secretive. So it's the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Gate! Thankfully, I tracked you here; otherwise, I would have missed a golden opportunity!"</p><p>With a sinister laugh, he vanished without a trace.</p><p>…</p><p>Further afield.</p><p>In a market town.</p><p>Low-level cultivators lacked the resources for long journeys to the Dharma Assembly, so they organized a smaller discussion gathering in the market town, even offering prizes. Participants were mostly disciples from nearby smaller sects.</p><p>Two people were dueling on stage, and the crowd watched intently.</p><p>Suddenly, there was an uproar outside. Several people went out and never returned.</p><p>Screams erupted, and others, unable to contain their curiosity, rushed out of the venue, even the two dueling on stage couldn't resist.</p><p>The street was teeming with people, all staring in astonishment towards the Taiyue sect.</p><p>"Over there... that looks like Mount Taiyue."</p><p>"What happened to the Taiyue sect?"</p><p>"Impossible, who would be so foolish as to attack the Taiyue sect? It looks like a treasure has appeared. Let's go!"</p><p>As this person moved, he was grabbed by a companion. "You dare to grab the Taiyue sect's treasure? You don't want to live!"</p><p>"What's to be afraid of!" The person retorted, pulling his companion along. "The celestial phenomenon is so striking, surely we aren't the only ones who see it.  Where there's a feast, there are scraps. The Taiyue sect will get the meat, but we can get the soup! Let's go check it out!"</p><p>His companion's heart stirred at his words.</p><p>In a short while, figures flew out from the market town, soaring towards Mount Taiyue on their magical tools.</p><p>Similar scenes played out in various places near the Taiyue sect.</p><p>...</p><p>Southern Mount Taiyue.</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin were searching for the strange-faced man in the wilderness.</p><p>They were joined by another person, Elder Ming of the Wan Du Mountain.</p><p>While the Poison King and Master Huaiyin tracked the strange-faced man, Elder Ming led the Wan Du Mountain experts in searching for clues, ensuring no trace was missed.</p><p>As they were traveling,</p><p>the Poison King and Master Huaiyin suddenly stopped, seemingly sensing something. Their faces changed, they exchanged a glance, and then their speed suddenly increased, their figures moving like lightning.</p><p>Elder Ming was clueless, his face full of astonishment, quickly following, but he could only see their backs.</p><p>After a chase,</p><p>Elder Ming finally caught up with the two who had landed on a mountaintop, and also saw the increasingly intense celestial phenomenon in the sky.</p><p>"What is that?"</p><p>Elder Ming was startled. "It seems to be coming from the direction of the Taiyue sect."</p><p>Master Huaiyin looked at the Poison King.</p><p>Being from the Western lands, he knew little about the Central Plains and was unclear about the meaning of such a phenomenon.</p><p>The Poison King remained silent, pondering for a long time.</p><p>"Southern Frontier, Immortal Mansion..."</p><p>The Poison King suddenly realized. "The Wuxiang Immortal Sect! No wonder this thief lingered in the Southern State, a vanished Nascent Soul cultivator. Surely some villain is causing trouble during the Dharma Assembly!"</p><p>"The Wuxiang Immortal Sect?" Master Huaiyin questioned.</p><p>The Poison King briefly explained the reason.</p><p>Master Huaiyin nodded and was about to go, but the Poison King stopped him.</p><p>After a moment of thought, the Poison King turned and said, "They dare to act now, and they're doing it on Mount Taiyue. Their forces must be considerable. If their cultivation is like this thief's, we alone may not be able to control the situation. The Daoist and Buddhist sects know the Wuxiang Immortal Sect best. Elder Ming, quickly return to your sect and send a message to the Ganlu Zen Temple, have them contact Master Xingji and find out what's going on!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Elder Ming left to carry out his orders.</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin went into Mount Taiyue.</p><p>...</p><p>Somewhere on the border of Manzhou and Nan Zhou.</p><p>The environment here was vastly different from the Southern Frontier, devoid of poisonous miasma for hundreds of miles.</p><p>The mountains were beautiful.</p><p>Morning mist flowed through the woods, birds sang in the quiet mountains, surpassing even the Central Plains in beauty.</p><p>Deep in the mountains lay an ancient temple, called the Yan Yue Temple.</p><p>Only a few temples dotted the forest, deeply embodying serenity and blending seamlessly with nature.</p><p>The Yan Yue Temple was only slightly larger than the Eight Scenic Views Temple.</p><p>Leaves fell in the temple courtyard.</p><p>Several nuns swept the leaves with brooms; everything was like an ordinary earthly temple.</p><p>In their hands, the brooms felt weightless, each sweep natural and effortless, creating a sense of tranquility—clearly a form of cultivation.</p><p>In a quiet room,</p><p>an old nun was counting beads, with incense burning before her, meditating.</p><p>Suddenly, a young nun rushed in, flustered.</p><p>"What's the commotion?"</p><p>The old nun asked softly.</p><p>Her voice seemed to possess a certain power, calming the young nun. The young nun bowed and said, "Master, a pagoda in the pagoda forest is suddenly emitting light."</p><p>The old nun paused, stood up, and went to the pagoda forest.</p><p>"Master, it's there."</p><p>The young nun pointed to a pagoda in the center of the pagoda forest, which was indeed glowing.</p><p>This pagoda was completely different in design from the other pagodas.</p><p>Seeing this, a ripple finally appeared on the old nun's face. She instantly appeared in front of the pagoda.</p><p>The old nun gently touched the pagoda, her surprise growing, murmuring, "The Wuxiang Immortal Sect..."</p><p>"Master, what's this? What is the Wuxiang Immortal Sect?" the young nun asked cautiously. She had guarded the pagoda forest for many years and had never seen anything like this before.</p><p>A Buddha's light shone from the old nun's palm, merging with the light of the pagoda.</p><p>Then, she reached into the pagoda, as if grasping something.</p><p>After sensing for a while, the old nun did not answer, but instructed, "Go and call your senior sisters out of seclusion. Yes, including your senior sister, Liuli."</p><p>"Yes!"</p>
