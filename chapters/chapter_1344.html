<h1>Chapter 1336: The Sun God Tree</h1><p>Vermilion Bird True Feather!</p><p>Bai's judgment was correct.</p><p>The Southern Bright Ember Fire was indeed the power emanating from this piece of Sacred Beast True Feather.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird True Feather floated within the flames. Its body was extremely thin and light, its color similar to the deep red of the Southern Bright Ember Fire, without a single blemish. Unlike the Phoenix Feather's multicolored splendor, it possessed a distinct, understated magnificence.</p><p>Silky, thread-like barbs, incredibly soft and supple, gently swayed. The feather itself seemed like a ball of fire, seamlessly merging with the Southern Bright Ember Fire.</p><p>It was hard to imagine that such a violent Demonic Fire originated from this thin feather.</p><p>A blessing in disguise.</p><p>Originally, searching for the Vermilion Bird True Feather within the raging Southern Bright Ember Fire was an incredibly troublesome and dangerous task. Qin Sang's chances of success were less than thirty percent, and this step was the most likely to result in an accident.</p><p>With the eruption of the Southern Bright Ember Fire, the Vermilion Bird True Feather had unexpectedly revealed itself.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully observed the Vermilion Bird True Feather and was delighted to discover that it was complete!</p><p>He remembered that, back then, when the Nine Phoenix King had offered the Celestial Phoenix True Feather, a mere broken barb had been able to penetrate the ancient restrictions of the Seven Slaughter Palace's inner hall. The later appearance of several Demon Kings within the inner hall must have been achieved with the Celestial Phoenix True Feather's power.</p><p>Although this was related to the Celestial Phoenix's inherent spatial abilities, it was enough to demonstrate the might of a Sacred Beast True Feather.</p><p>The Southern Bright Ember Fire originated from the Sacred Beast True Feather, yet it was terrified of the green copper piece.  Qin Sang couldn't fathom the green copper piece's origins. This thought flashed through his mind, and a joyful expression appeared on his face. When refining his magical treasure, he had prepared precisely for this situation. Today, he had a high chance of subduing the Southern Bright Ember Fire!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the scorching Demonic Fire aura, walking step by step towards the Southern Bright Ember Fire.</p><p>He focused intently on the Vermilion Bird True Feather, pondering how to proceed.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird True Feather was the source of the Southern Bright Ember Fire.</p><p>There was no need to worry about the surrounding Demonic Fire.  As long as he could obtain and subdue the Vermilion Bird True Feather itself, he would have achieved his goal.</p><p>Although he could clearly see the Vermilion Bird True Feather's location, grabbing it from within the Demonic Fire was no easy feat. He would need to take some risks.</p><p>Due to the Demonic Fire's eruption, his previously prepared methods were no longer applicable. He could only adapt to the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in place, contemplating for a long while.</p><p>His gaze swept back and forth between the Vermilion Bird True Feather, the Southern Bright Ember Fire, and the golden thread ancient restriction, deducing the feasibility of his actions. A plan gradually took shape.</p><p>"Although I cannot fully comprehend the golden thread ancient restriction, by observing the confrontation between the ancient restriction and the Demonic Fire, I should be able to discover some patterns and then utilize the power of the ancient restriction to achieve my goal."</p><p>Qin Sang acted as soon as the thought occurred to him.</p><p>He retreated a short distance, alleviating the scorching heat somewhat. He took out a bottle of pills and swallowed them all. Then, disregarding his True Essence expenditure, he concentrated on observing the changes in the golden thread ancient restriction.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>There had been too many unforeseen events, and the time spent far exceeded Qin Sang's expectations. Fortunately, he hadn't received any messages from Bai, allowing him to focus without distractions.</p><p>An unknown amount of time later.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow slightly relaxed, as if he had discovered something.</p><p>Just at this moment, a strange fluctuation emanated from the Nascent Soul Puppet. Qin Sang was startled to realize that his own True Essence was also running low. He had no choice but to leave the hidden passage.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged at the entrance of the stone hall, he consumed pills and recovered completely.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the hidden passage and looked at the Southern Bright Ember Fire with anticipation. A white light flashed in his palm, and the newly refined magical treasure appeared in his left hand.</p><p>The magical treasure's shape was quite peculiar, resembling a white copper spirit tree.</p><p>Its base was the Nine Lives Black Tortoise shell. After Qin Sang's refinement, the shell's form hadn't changed much, only the markings on its back had faded somewhat.</p><p>The true transformation lay within. The green copper piece had been embedded into the shell.</p><p>This step had consumed the most of Qin Sang's mental energy. After countless attempts, he had finally managed to perfectly fuse the two treasures without conflict.</p><p>The spirit tree grew from the tortoise shell.  Its trunk was sturdy, branching out into several limbs. It was refined from the mysterious white copper and other spiritual materials, primarily white copper, hence its white appearance.</p><p>At this moment, the white copper's power was restrained, unlike before when it emitted a blazing light.  It appeared somewhat pale.</p><p>Qin Sang grasped the spirit tree, walked to the edge of the Southern Bright Ember Fire, and sensed the Demonic Fire's power. Holding his breath, he suddenly raised his other hand and pressed it virtually against the stone wall.</p><p>The golden thread ancient restriction was constantly changing, currently transitioning from dim to bright.</p><p>An illusory hand seal landed precisely on a rune, causing the golden thread ancient restriction to brighten further.</p><p>Correspondingly, the Demonic Fire's power was suppressed.</p><p>Qin Sang certainly hadn't comprehended the ancient restriction in such a short time. Instead, with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's assistance, he had grasped the patterns of its changes and was borrowing its power.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang poured all his True Essence into the spirit tree and charged into the Demonic Fire. The green copper piece's fluctuations emanated from the spirit tree, suppressing the Southern Bright Ember Fire's power.</p><p>Under the spirit tree's protection, Qin Sang successfully rushed in. A flash of joy crossed his eyes, and he immediately sent the spirit tree flying towards the Vermilion Bird True Feather.</p><p>An unexpected scene unfolded.</p><p>Without warning, the Vermilion Bird True Feather pulsed sharply and vanished into thin air. In the next instant, it reappeared a zhang away, still gently swaying. The spirit tree missed its target.</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned.</p><p>He hadn't expected the True Feather to evade him. He had miscalculated!</p><p>The green copper piece's protection could only last for a short time, forcing Qin Sang to grab the spirit tree and retreat.</p><p>Although the duration was short, Qin Sang's mind and True Essence were greatly depleted.</p><p>He stared at the Vermilion Bird True Feather and noticed it had become stationary again, without any further changes. It seemed that it wasn't sentient. Most likely, the True Feather and the green copper piece clashed, causing the feather to instinctively avoid it.</p><p>Qin Sang felt troubled. After recovering, he attempted again.</p><p>He failed several times in a row.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird True Feather was slippery, impossible to grasp.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, contemplated for a moment, and realized that he would probably need to further comprehend the golden thread seal, utilizing its power to restrict the Vermilion Bird True Feather's movement.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang turned his attention back to the golden thread ancient restriction.</p><p>Thanks to the Heaven's Eye divine ability, after much contemplation, Qin Sang finally made a new discovery.</p><p>After adjusting his breath, Qin Sang returned to the hidden passage, his face now carrying more confidence.  He left his Nascent Soul Puppet outside the Demonic Fire and charged into the Southern Bright Ember Fire without hesitation.</p><p>The spirit tree descended towards the Vermilion Bird True Feather.</p><p>The familiar scene replayed, the True Feather pulsed.</p><p>But at that very moment, the Nascent Soul Puppet punched the golden thread ancient restriction. Golden light erupted, and as expected, the True Feather was affected. When it reappeared, its trajectory was exactly as Qin Sang had predicted!</p><p>The spirit tree happened to be in that very spot. The instant the True Feather materialized, the tree descended swiftly!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Demonic Fire surged.</p><p>Qin Sang paid no attention, his hand seals rapidly changing. A green light suddenly emerged from the spirit tree's base, landing squarely on the True Feather's body.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird True Feather's light dimmed, unexpectedly pulled into the green light.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The tortoise shell vibrated violently, the markings on its back turning crimson at a visible speed, rapidly spreading towards the spirit tree's trunk, dyeing the white copper red as well.</p><p>Flower buds on the spirit tree's branches blossomed, a crimson aura taking shape within them.</p><p>Nine in total!</p><p>"A pity it's not the Three-Legged Golden Crow!"</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind as he looked at the divine tree.
