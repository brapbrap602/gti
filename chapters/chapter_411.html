<h1>Chapter 404: Bloodwood</h1><p>(Went home, got drunk, and completely forgot to update, sorry.</p><p>Posting two chapters together.  Happy New Year, everyone!</p><p>It's a new year, so I'll give Qinsang a little treat as a New Year's gift. Everyone keeps saying I'm mistreating the protagonist, but this is supposed to be a power fantasy, after all. ^_^)</p><p>Qinsang relied on the faint warmth emanating from the Red Pellet to withstand the biting wind.</p><p>He constantly monitored the Red Pellet, meticulously calculating the time. He had to leave the deep chasm before it burned out; otherwise, his life would be forfeit, and any treasures would be meaningless.</p><p>He descended rapidly.</p><p>He had already fallen an unknown distance, yet he hadn't seen any trace of the so-called heavenly treasures.</p><p>Unknowingly, the ice layer had vanished, replaced by frozen earth.</p><p>Even after passing through the thick ice, he still hadn't found the source of the Frostwind.</p><p>Where did this sinister wind originate, and what caused it?</p><p>Qinsang marveled inwardly as he continued downward along the frozen earth. He found the chasm widening, eventually opening into a vast abyss. The abyss seemed bottomless, filled with wisps of pale green wind, like swimming fish.  These wisps, upon reaching the chasm's mouth, were captured by the wind column, merging into one and being carried outwards.</p><p>Qinsang dared not enter the abyss. These green wisps were the essence of the Frostwind. Even brushing against one the size of his forearm would freeze him instantly.</p><p>Was his guess wrong, and there was nothing here?  Or was the Thunderhawk's nest further down in the abyss?</p><p>After all, with the Thunderhawk's power, it wouldn't fear the Frostwind.</p><p>It seemed like a wasted trip.</p><p>Qinsang sighed inwardly, clenching his fist. The Red Pellet in his palm had already shrunk considerably.  Staying here was pointless.</p><p>Just as he was about to turn back, Qinsang's gaze sharpened. He turned his head, staring at the distant stone wall, as if he had noticed something inadvertently. His movements abruptly stopped.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Qinsang skirted along the stone wall.  He hadn't gone far when he saw a dark opening hidden behind several protruding boulders.</p><p>The opening wasn't large, only tall enough for a person and wide enough for three abreast, perfectly concealed by the boulders.</p><p>Could this be the Thunderhawk's nest?</p><p>For a Thunderhawk whose wingspan could blot out the sun, this cave seemed far too small.</p><p>Unfamiliar with the Thunderhawk's habits, Qinsang hesitated. He cautiously extended his divine sense into the cave, discovering no barriers within. The cold wind poured into the stone cave, as frigid as outside.</p><p>It looked like a naturally formed, rough-hewn cave.</p><p>Qinsang pondered for a moment, checked the concealment of his escape techniques, and then carefully entered the cave.</p><p>The cave was deep.  After walking a certain distance, Qinsang's expression shifted slightly.  A faint warmth emanated from the depths of the cave, and the wind's chill lessened.</p><p>Taking a few more steps, a weak red glow flickered in the deep cave, piquing Qinsang's curiosity.</p><p>Qinsang glanced at the Red Pellet in his hand, pursed his lips, and with a grit of his teeth, he dashed forward.</p><p>A wave of heat washed over him, dispelling the cold clinging to him.</p><p>Immediately following was a surge of incredibly dense spiritual energy, invigorating Qinsang and filling him with wonder.</p><p>The place with the densest spiritual energy he had ever encountered was the cave on the back of Mount Shaohua, where he had stayed during his Foundation Establishment after passing the Red Dust Gourd trial. That mountain housed the cave dwelling of Mount Shaohua's founder, Patriarch Dongyang, and was the convergence point of all the sect's spiritual veins. Even his own Spirit Spring Cave Dwelling couldn't compare.</p><p>Yet that cave paled in comparison to this one.</p><p>Qinsang's eyes widened as he surveyed the cave before him.</p><p>Despite its proximity to the Frostwind, the cave was exceptionally warm.  This was because a red river flowed through it, not an ordinary lava flow, but a subterranean Earthfire Vein!</p><p>Beside this Earthfire Vein flowed a clear stream, running parallel to it.</p><p>This small river was even more extraordinary: it was a river of spiritual energy originating from a Spirit Spring.</p><p>A Spirit Spring forming a river!</p><p>The Earthfire Vein and the Spirit Energy River flowed side by side, influencing the cave's landscape.</p><p>Jade-like plants, resembling red coral, grew along the Earthfire Vein, while lush green grass thrived along the banks of the Spirit Energy River.</p><p>Two contrasting scenes coexisted within a single cave, complementing each other yet distinctly separate, creating a bizarre spectacle.</p><p>Taking in the full view of the cave, Qinsang was certain that this was the Thunderhawk's nest!</p><p>Such a cave dwelling was incredibly rare, a once-in-a-lifetime find.  Only a Transformation stage demon or a Nascent Soul ancestor could possess the ability to locate and occupy such a place.</p><p>While marveling at the wondrous scene, Qinsang quickly scanned the cave, his face gradually falling with disappointment.</p><p>Whether by the Earthfire Vein or the Spirit Energy River, only ordinary plants grew.  None of them resembled heavenly treasures.</p><p>Even he wouldn't value these things. What could possibly be worth the efforts of two Nascent Soul cultivators?</p><p>Wait, where was the Spirit Spring, the source of the Spirit Energy River?</p><p>Qinsang focused his gaze on the depths of the cave and cautiously entered.  He landed silently on the flat ground between the two rivers and, after covering some distance, finally found their source.</p><p>A jade pool, constructed from Spirit Jade, came into view.</p><p>The circular pool, with a diameter of several dozen meters, was exquisitely crafted. Every piece of jade had been meticulously polished.</p><p>The source of both the Earthfire Vein and the Spirit Energy River was this jade pool!</p><p>The two distinct "waters" each occupied half of the pool. At their center, a silver-white sphere of lightning hovered silently above the surface.</p><p>The jade pool seemed like a nest nurturing the lightning sphere.</p><p>Lightning flashed within the sphere.</p><p>Each hair-thin bolt possessed terrifying power!</p><p>Sensing the aura emanating from the lightning, Qinsang felt a tremor of fear and dared not approach.</p><p>Within the sphere, tiny white fragments seemed to exist, constantly bombarded by lightning yet remaining unscathed. Their composition was unknown.</p><p>However, what captivated Qinsang's attention the most was something else within the jade pool.</p><p>Half of the clear pool water was the Spirit Spring. Within it, a striking blood-red light soared upwards, dyeing the water a faint crimson, giving it an eerie appearance.</p><p>Qinsang peered closely and finally saw that beneath the blood-red light was a piece of blood-colored spirit wood.</p><p>The spirit wood was entirely blood-colored, a dark, almost污秽 shade of red. Even within the purest Spirit Spring, it couldn't conceal the aura of decay it emanated.</p><p>Upon seeing this wood, one's first thoughts would inevitably turn to words like decline, decay, and other such depressing notions.</p><p>Qinsang was stunned for a moment, then a flash of inspiration struck him.  He suddenly remembered something, and his eyes filled with intense shock and ecstasy.</p><p>"Could this... be the Netherworld Blood Mulberry?"</p><p>Qinsang murmured, his gaze fixated on the bloodwood, unable to look away.</p><p>The Netherworld Blood Mulberry, one of the ten legendary Divine Trees, was the ultimate wood of decay!</p><p>Qinsang suddenly recalled a secret Cloudtraveler had mentioned. A Netherworld Blood Mulberry had once appeared in Boundless Valley.  It was shattered during a battle between Nascent Soul cultivators, and its fragments scattered throughout the valley.  Many cultivators searched for the divine wood, but all efforts proved futile.</p><p>Could this piece of bloodwood be a fragment of that Netherworld Blood Mulberry, landing here after being shattered and then nurtured by the Thunderhawk in the Spirit Spring?</p>
