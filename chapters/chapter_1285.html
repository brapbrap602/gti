<h1>Chapter 1277: Various Schemes</h1><p>“The demon clans helped us drive back the Abyss, but their soldiers won’t go beyond the Skymarch Plateau.  Once we push into the grasslands, we’re on our own. However, we can negotiate individually with the demon kings.  If we offer them irresistible terms, we might be able to recruit some…”  Daoist Zhen said, glancing at Qin Sang.</p><p>The demon clans were compelled by an ancient pact to fight off foreign invaders, but the pact didn’t obligate them to help us invade others; this request is reasonable.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly. He understood Daoist Zhen wanted him to act as an intermediary.  But even when disguised as a demon, he hadn't made many friends among the demon kings. He only had a somewhat amicable relationship with the Snake King. After learning his true identity, he had no idea what the Snake King would think.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's reluctance, Daoist Zhen showed a flicker of disappointment, guessing Qin Sang's predicament; he couldn't force him.</p><p>“Humph! The Tianyao Plateau hopes we humans will fight endlessly, drenched in blood, and never at peace. If not for the pact, they wouldn’t only stand idly by; they’d probably secretly fan the flames, letting us and the Abyss fight to the death. This is a clever plan. If we can’t completely extinguish the Abyss’s arrogance, we’ll be trapped in an endless cycle of war,”</p><p>someone coldly snorted, expressing great dissatisfaction with the demon clans' actions.</p><p>The hall was filled with those who understood the demon clans' intentions.</p><p>Someone immediately laughed, “If the humans and demon clans reversed in power and status, we too would worry about a unified demon clan attacking us. It’s only human nature. Whatever the demon clans' intentions, being able to send troops to aid us at our most difficult moment, we can't ask for more.”</p><p>“However, the Tianyao Plateau has always been united, unlike our warring humans.  They've become increasingly powerful in recent years, with many demon kings emerging. Thankfully, Friend Qin is of human origin, not a demon of the Bright Moon King's stature. Otherwise, we would truly worry about the day the demon clan possesses sufficient power, unwilling to remain dormant on the Tianyao Plateau, and causing further trouble.”</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator from the Skymarch Alliance sighed.</p><p>Even Dongyang Bo had to admit that based on recent achievements, Qin Sang possessed the greatest potential among all the newly promoted Nascent Soul cultivators of the Two Realms Alliance. He could even be considered unprecedented.</p><p>Of course, how far he could go was hard to say. It all depended on whether Qin Sang would encounter insurmountable bottlenecks. Similar tragedies weren't unheard of.</p><p>…</p><p>Skymarch Plateau.</p><p>Before the second tier, the Abyss central camp.</p><p>The Abyss had built a city of rammed earth here. Flags fluttered, and the cultivator army was assembling.</p><p>In the grandest palace at the heart of the camp, a cultivator in a blue Daoist robe, with a cold face and black beard, stood before the palace gates, looking at the vast snowy plains.</p><p>Only one tier separated them from Skymarch City atop the Skymarch Plateau, yet it felt like an insurmountable chasm, firmly guarded by the Skymarch Alliance and the Little Cold Region.</p><p>This person was True Person Canghong, one of the three leaders of the Abyss.</p><p>His strength was equally unfathomable, not inferior to Elder Tianzheng. He was once the leading figure of the Righteous Path within the Abyss. Only after Ye Laomo’s sudden rise did he relinquish the title of the Abyss’ strongest cultivator.</p><p>Judging by appearances, True Person Canghong appeared to be about fifty years old.</p><p>He stared at the Skymarch Plateau for a long time, recalling the various messages he’d received recently, and let out an almost inaudible sigh before returning to the hall.</p><p>In the center of the great hall, a dazzling light shone, revealing a small snow mountain.</p><p>The snow mountain's outline was identical to the Skymarch Plateau.</p><p>On the snow mountain, not only were all the camps and cities, including Skymarch City, perfectly replicated, but there were also countless tiny figures, like ants, gathered in clusters throughout the mountain.</p><p>These figures weren’t inanimate objects. They could move freely and use spells and incantations like real cultivators.</p><p>The figures were different colors. For example, red figures represented the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Two Realms Alliance.</p><p>These were created by the Abyss using restrictions and talismans, similar to a war-gaming sand table.</p><p>True Person Canghong's brow was furrowed. After pondering for a moment, he suddenly raised his hand and repeatedly tapped the snow mountain.</p><p>The figures on it began to move rapidly, some retreating, some attacking.  Amidst the slaughter, colorful spells and restrictive lights flickered, followed by swathes of figures falling.</p><p>“Almost forgot!”</p><p>True Person Canghong suddenly remembered something and pointed at two red figures.</p><p>These two represented Qin Sang and Qing Jun.</p><p>Canghong had learned about what happened in the Blood Lake. Their opponents finding the core of the Black Pagoda Formation so quickly was unexpected. But what surprised them most was the sudden eruption of power from Qin Sang and Qing Jun.</p><p>If not for these two, even in a head-on confrontation, the result would not have been so disastrous, leading to the Abyss's passive position.</p><p>The power of these two red figures had greatly increased.</p><p>Such powerful cultivators, without cultivators of the same level to counter them, could only be handled by sending multiple Nascent Soul cultivators or using the Nether Crystal Tower to restrain them.  Allowing them to wreak havoc on the battlefield was something no one could bear.</p><p>The forces of Zu Yuan were clearly struggling, even with the幽晶塔, they were forced into repeated retreats.</p><p>After a review of the situation.</p><p>Master Canghong’s hand swept across the snow-capped mountain, restoring it to its original appearance.  His miniature soldiers stirred, reforming their battle lines. He commanded them to continue the fight.</p><p>Again and again, the situation remained unfavorable for Zu Yuan.</p><p>Master Canghong pondered for a moment, then took out several sword talismans. Using his finger as a brush, he wrote with swift strokes, before flicking them out. The talismans transformed into streams of light, flying out of the hall.</p><p>The strain of overthinking took its toll. Master Canghong gently rubbed his temples, about to return to his meditation when he sensed something, looking up towards the hall entrance.</p><p>“Master Canghong, I apologize for troubling you during this time…”</p><p>A voice approached.</p><p>Moments later, a figure appeared before the hall. It was Ye Laomo.</p><p>Master Canghong frowned, seeing him alone.  He immediately asked, “How is Tianzheng doing?”</p><p>Ye Laomo sighed, stepping into the hall.</p><p>“Tianzheng used a forbidden technique to escape death, but the technique took a heavy toll.  Combined with the severity of the enemy's attack, his injuries worsened. His foundation was nearly shattered. We sent him back to Xing Heng Sect’s Star Pool, channeling our energy into the pool to stabilize his condition. He’s gradually recovering, but won’t be able to fight for several years.”</p><p>Hearing this, Master Canghong sighed inwardly. This was the worst-case scenario he had anticipated.</p><p>At this moment, Ye Laomo suddenly coughed lightly.</p><p>Master Canghong sized him up. “I heard you were forced to self-destruct a clone comparable to your main body?”</p><p>Ye Laomo chuckled wryly. “Master Canghong, please don’t look at me like that. That clone was created recently while I was refining a treasure banner in Blood Lake. It was an intuition coupled with a secret technique I’d acquired earlier. If I'd possessed it sooner, I wouldn't have held back, and wouldn't have needed to hide. But before I could achieve any merit, I was defeated by that young Mingyue Yao Wang, and it even affected my main body.”</p><p>“Mingyue Yao Wang?”</p><p>Master Canghong chuckled.  “Ye Laomo, you haven’t heard yet. That person isn’t a demon king, but a human cultivator.”</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>The next chapter will be delayed.</p>
