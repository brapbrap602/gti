Chapter 634: I Don't Want This

A horrific massacre unfolded before everyone's eyes.
The priests of Winged Serpent Village, emissaries of the Witch God, were slaughtered in an instant, blood splattering across the sky.
The villagers were terrified, screaming and fleeing in panic.
Even the Winged Serpent villagers were scared out of their wits, no longer daring to remain in the village.
"The priests of Winged Serpent Village slaughtered their people to feed their Gu insects. The Witch God is enraged, and divine punishment has been delivered. In the future, a new emissary will arrive…"
Qin Sang's voice echoed throughout the area, paving the way for Ya Gu.
He carried Ya Gu to the priests' cave.
Ya Gu was sound asleep, her expression serene, a stark contrast to the blood on her face.
After placing her on the ground, Qin Sang reached out and retrieved the priests' storage pouches, which landed on the grass before him.
The items within weren't valuable, nothing that caught Qin Sang's eye.
There were instructions on breeding Winged Serpents, but Qin Sang deemed their potential too low to be chosen as his lifebound Gu.
Moreover, the Winged Serpents' venom wasn't incurable; the effort required to cultivate them wasn't worth the reward.
What truly interested Qin Sang were the village's divine markings.
Their power was unique, unlike lifebound Gu insects, which occupied a special place within one's cultivation. The method of cultivation seemed entirely different from that of immortal cultivators.
If it didn't require too much effort and offered substantial power, Qin Sang considered incorporating them into his own cultivation.
As long as it increased his strength, he cared little for appearances.
After emptying the pouches, Qin Sang found an animal hide within the elder priest's pouch, on which several patterns were drawn.
One of them was identical to the divine marking on the priestess.
He searched through everything but couldn't find any explanation of the markings.  Qin Sang picked up the hide and examined it closely, gradually gaining some insight, but he was still far from truly understanding them.
After all, it was a completely foreign power.
Without guidance, even someone as powerful as Qin Sang couldn't decipher it.
However, Qin Sang had a hunch that these markings were a way for the Witch people to draw upon natural energies, likely requiring their unique talents.
He was human and lacked such an innate ability.
Humans could cultivate lifebound Gu insects as long as they could suppress the backlash, but divine markings were different.

While Qin Sang studied the markings, Ya Gu stirred and woke up.
Her eyes were hazy at first, but she quickly recalled what had happened before she lost consciousness. Panic filled her face until she saw Qin Sang, and then she calmed down.
"You're awake?"
Qin Sang pointed to the small lake. "Go wash your face and clean off the blood."
Ya Gu walked to the lake, scooped up some water, and was about to wash her face when she saw her bloodstained reflection, looking like a murderer. She froze.
Seeing this, Qin Sang recalled his first kill in this world, stabbing those bandits. He had reacted similarly.
After a while, Ya Gu submerged her face in the water, washed off the blood, and returned to sit quietly beside Qin Sang.
Qin Sang noticed a change in her demeanor.
Understandably so, after experiencing such dramatic events and personally killing her enemies, the Witch God's emissaries no less, how could she not change?
"What are your thoughts now?" Qin Sang asked.
Ya Gu hugged her knees, as if seeking warmth, and stared at Qin Sang's profile, shaking her head.
"The world of cultivation is like this, unreasonable.
"The Winged Serpent priests at least had a reason to kill you. If you were unlucky enough to encounter bloodthirsty demons, you could be killed for no reason at all.
"These past few days, you've developed a sense of Qi, making you a cultivator.  I don't know if that's good or bad for you.
"It can make you stronger, allowing you to control your own destiny, but it will also bring trouble and danger. If you want to live longer, remember today.
"Of course, decisiveness alone is not enough. The rest you must learn yourself.
"Here, take this…"
Qin Sang took out the two Soul Eater Spikes and handed them to Ya Gu, explaining how to use them.  "These Soul Eater Spikes have been enhanced with Black Flood Dragon venom.  Used correctly, they can kill a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator.  Even a late-Foundation Establishment cultivator could be severely poisoned, giving you ample time to escape."
Ya Gu took the spikes but didn't look at them. She continued to stare at Qin Sang, hesitated, then softly asked, "Brother One-Arm, can I ask you something?"
Qin Sang nodded.
"What's your cultivation level?" Ya Gu asked.
"Early Core Formation," Qin Sang didn't hide it. "I recently formed my core."
"Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation…"
Ya Gu muttered to herself, the light in her eyes dimming rapidly.  "You said that with my talent, reaching Foundation Establishment would be difficult, and forming a core would be impossible in my lifetime…"
Qin Sang hummed in agreement, then shook his head. "Anything is possible, but realistically, your chances of forming a core are slim. Now that the Winged Serpent priests are dead, you're the only emissary here.  Until your cultivation improves, I'll have the Five Venom Sect manage things for you. With these Soul Eater Spikes, no one can threaten your position.  You'll be the ruler, everyone will fear and respect you, and you'll have absolute power.  You can deal with those who bullied you as you see fit…"
Qin Sang spoke at length, but Ya Gu remained unmoved, fixated on him. She asked, "You're leaving, aren't you? You won't come back."
Qin Sang considered it, then nodded.
Ya Gu suddenly lowered her head, holding back tears, clutching the Green Butterfly Coin tightly in her hand.  "Can I keep this?  Don't take it back."
Ya Gu's voice was laced with a plea.
Qin Sang smiled ruefully.  "These Green Butterfly Coins have a distance limit. I'll be leaving the Bear Mountain region soon, rendering it useless. It's not valuable, keep it if you want."
He stood up. "I've taught you all I can. I should go. I don't know when we'll meet again. Take care of yourself."
Unexpectedly, Ya Gu stood up and rushed to Qin Sang. "Brother One-Arm, can I not be the Winged Serpent Village emissary? I don't want everyone's reverence, I don't want absolute power…"
Qin Sang was surprised. "What do you want?"
"I want to cultivate!"
Ya Gu bit her lip, her eyes filled with determination, meeting Qin Sang's gaze.  "You said that to achieve something in the immortal path, one must be single-minded, focusing solely on cultivation. Power, delicacies, pleasure – I don't want any of it! I don't desire anything else, and I won't cling to you.  I just ask that you show me a path, tell me where I can cultivate like that.  As the Winged Serpent emissary, I'll never…"
She paused, then murmured, "I'm not willing to accept my fate!"
