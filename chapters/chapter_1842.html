<h1>Chapter 1833 War Drums</h1><p>Mo Xingdao took out a jade slip and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing the treasures listed within the jade slip, Qin Sang felt a slight relief. He had feared Mo Xingdao would request something incredibly rare in this world.</p><p>Gathering these treasures, while a Herculean task for Mo Xingdao at present, was merely a matter of venturing deeper into the Baleful Wastelands once more for Qin Sang, then spreading the word and awaiting a response.</p><p>He was just about to visit Master Gu in White Rock County. Going through the Dao Court should expedite matters.</p><p>After staying at Mo Xingdao's residence for only an hour, Qin Sang left, traveling westward until he reached a mountain at the border between Jushan County and White Rock County, where he found the relocated Mirror Stage Temple.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru had initially intended to settle within White Rock County, but later reconsidered, finding it inconvenient to be under the Dao Court's jurisdiction and lacking a suitable location. As a compromise, he chose this place to build a branch temple.</p><p>The eminent monks of Mirror Stage Temple were already well-acquainted with Qin Sang. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, they entered the meditation hall to discuss the Dharma.</p><p>Qin Sang shared his insights without reservation, and when he inquired about Buddhist doctrines, the monks reciprocated with equal openness.</p><p>It was as if Qin Sang and the monks were collectively comprehending this seal.</p><p>Departing from the Mirror Stage Temple's branch, Qin Sang continued westward into White Rock County. He first visited Master Lingxu and finally arrived at Master Gu's residence.</p><p>Since their last parting, this was Qin Sang's first visit.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you possess remarkable generosity. Leaving such a precious treasure at my residence without a single visit for a century, aren't you afraid I might abscond with it, leaving you empty-handed?” Master Gu's tone carried a hint of playful reproach. Even this time, it was she who had summoned him with an insistent letter.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled upon hearing this. He naturally valued Master Gu highly. Restoring the broken drum would significantly enhance his artifact refinement skills, giving him greater confidence in repairing the Taiyi Star Carriage in the future.</p><p>However, for many years, he had prioritized cultivation, delaying his artifact refinement pursuits.</p><p>After all, the depths of the Ritual Altar were exceptionally perilous. Even if he repaired the Taiyi Star Carriage, he needed sufficient strength to traverse the Two Realms Barrier.</p><p>“Master Gu’s reputation for integrity is renowned throughout the land. If Master Gu is not trustworthy, then there are no trustworthy people in this world…”</p><p>Before Qin Sang could finish his flattery, Master Gu impatiently interrupted him.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Master Gu led Qin Sang into the fire chamber.</p><p>Within the fire chamber, flames blazed fiercely. A crimson fireball hung suspended in the air, and within the heart of the fireball was the broken drum.</p><p>The flames enveloped it, yet no flicker truly touched the drum. The treasure’s aura remained unchanged from years past.</p><p>Qin Sang, unable to discern the reason, looked at Master Gu with some puzzlement.</p><p>“Sit!”</p><p>Master Gu pointed to the floor. Once Qin Sang was seated, she sat cross-legged before him and said, “Since your departure, Fellow Daoist, I have spent every waking moment with this treasure, neglecting sleep and food…”</p><p>As Master Gu recounted her experience, Qin Sang learned the entire process of her comprehending the broken drum.</p><p>Although they had exchanged letters before, the details were not as comprehensive.</p><p>Due to their prior agreement, Master Gu meticulously explained her thoughts on comprehending the treasure, including the true meaning of the artifact refinement path. Some insights struck Qin Sang with sudden enlightenment, his demeanor growing more respectful, his listening more attentive.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s earnest expression, Master Gu's demeanor softened. Finally, she asked, "How much did you understand?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "Master, are you telling me there are two options for restoring this treasure?"</p><p>Master Gu revealed a satisfied expression. It seemed this person’s aptitude for artifact refinement was not bad. “You are a quick learner! That is precisely my meaning, but the choice is yours to make. The first option is to restore the treasure to its original state, a feat far beyond my current abilities. The second is for me to repair it based on my understanding of the artifact refinement path, but this will diminish its power, perhaps even altering its function. However, I can commence the refinement immediately.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang hesitated for a moment before continuing, "If we choose the second option, after it's restored, can it be reverted to its current form?"</p><p>Master Gu was slightly taken aback. “That’s…quite a thought…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “Master just mentioned that this treasure’s artifact spirit is extinguished. Even if we achieve perfect restoration, it will at most be comparable to a Spiritual Treasure, and more likely, only a Pseudo Spiritual Treasure. I am not lacking in Pseudo Spiritual Treasures. Therefore, the greatest value of this treasure lies in validating Master’s artifact refinement path and improving my own artifact refinement skills.”</p><p>After a pause, Qin Sang resolutely stated, “Let’s proceed with Master’s method, restore the treasure, and then revert it to its original form. This should prove beneficial for the next refinement!”</p><p>“If you are willing, I am certainly happy to oblige,” Master Gu had no objections. This proposal was the most advantageous for her. She hadn’t expected Qin Sang to possess such boldness.</p><p>Restoring a Postnatal Heavenly Treasure consumed countless spiritual materials, a burden most could not bear.</p><p>Decisive as always, Qin Sang retrieved the beast bones and other materials he had accumulated from his Thousand Jun Ring, adding, “Master, please personally oversee this refinement. I will act as your fire-stoking assistant.”</p><p>He knew his own limitations.</p><p>For him to restore a Postnatal Heavenly Treasure now, even with Master Gu’s assistance, the chance of success was less than ten percent.</p><p>Master Gu's expression shifted slightly. She glanced at Qin Sang and stopped him from retrieving more treasures. “These are sufficient. My residence still holds some reserves, enough to cover the expenses of this refinement. As for the next time, I have some inklings and a few essential items you should seek out.”</p><p>She mentioned several names, which Qin Sang carefully noted.</p><p>Following this, Qin Sang, unusually, remained at Master Gu's residence for an entire year, studying artifact refinement.</p><p>Master Gu, having prepared beforehand, procured the spiritual materials within a year, incidentally also gathering most of what Mo Xingdao needed.</p><p>Within the fire chamber.</p><p>The firelight blazed brightly.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Master Gu seemed draped in a layer of crimson gauze.</p><p>The piercing red light reflected on Qin Sang's face as he watched Master Gu’s movements intently, afraid to miss a single detail.</p><p>At this moment, Master Gu was employing an artifact refinement technique he had never seen before. First, she condensed eight spiritual incense sticks with her divine abilities, placing them in eight directions.</p><p>As the incense burned, the裊裊 fragrant smoke converged towards Master Gu’s hands.</p><p>The fragrance merged with the spiritual fire, triggering a bizarre transformation, as if cloud dragons were circling and frolicking around the broken drum.</p><p>With each hand seal she formed, the cracks on the drum’s surface gradually closed.</p><p>Master Gu worked with the meticulousness of a skilled artisan, carefully weaving over the damaged areas, gradually restoring them.</p><p>Easier said than done, this single step alone consumed ten days.</p><p>Finally, the drum’s surface was completely restored.</p><p>Master Gu abruptly opened her eyes, her gaze sharp. With a wave of her hand, the spiritual drum burst forth from the flames, completely renewed!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The flames subsided.</p><p>Qin Sang flew to Master Gu’s side, examining the spiritual drum. The repaired areas on its surface were nearly invisible, radiating a jade-like,莹 white luster. The drum’s body was red, adorned with enigmatic markings.</p><p>Master Gu raised her right hand, cradling the spiritual drum in her palm. Her divine sense slowly probed within, finding no trace of the Treasure Recognition Technique, but she could control it normally.</p><p>According to her understanding, the True Treasure’s artifact spirit was extinguished, so there was no Treasure Recognition Technique to speak of. Whether a Postnatal Heavenly Treasure retained its Treasure Recognition Technique depended on the relationship between its master and artifact spirit, on whether there was mutual trust.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently beside her.</p><p>A moment later, the spiritual drum rose on its own, transforming into a streak of red light as it flew into the air, expanding into a massive drum tens of zhang in diameter.</p><p>The drum’s body vibrated.</p><p>Though no one struck it, a thunderous drumming sound emanated from within.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The instant the drum sounded, Qin Sang’s heart leaped violently. Even with his unwavering resolve, he felt a surge of excitement, as if a boundless battle intent was rising from within him.</p><p>Those with weaker wills, stirred by the drumbeat, might instantly forget their own lives and charge into battle without regard for the consequences.</p><p>Next, Master Gu tested the spiritual drum's other divine abilities, all related to battle formations.</p><p>The treasure's purpose was self-evident.</p><p>"What a pity..."</p><p>Master Gu sighed.</p><p>Hailing from the Daoist sect, she instinctively considered the Dao Court's interests. The appearance of this spiritual drum on the battlefield would undoubtedly provide their side with a powerful advantage.</p><p>If it were a complete Postnatal Heavenly Treasure, this treasure alone could increase the Dao Court’s chances of victory by ten percent!</p><p>If its Spiritual Treasure power could be restored, it would be a rare and invaluable treasure. Master Gu would exhaust all means to acquire it.</p><p>Unfortunately, Master Gu confirmed that this treasure was the natal Spiritual Treasure of some senior, and even complete restoration would only allow it to exert power equivalent to a Supreme Grade Magical Treasure.</p><p>Regardless of how unique its function, a Supreme Grade Magical Treasure could not alter the course of the war.</p><p>Of course, the spiritual drum was not entirely worthless. One day, when she fully comprehended this treasure, she might have a chance to replicate similar artifacts.</p><p>Master Gu shook her head slightly, handing the spiritual drum to Qin Sang. "This is a war drum..."</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it, grasping its function with a brief examination. His emotions remained relatively unperturbed.</p><p>The spiritual drum was a natal Spiritual Treasure, suitable for him to keep and improve his artifact refinement skills. If it wasn't a natal Spiritual Treasure, it wouldn't be of much use to him personally. Presenting it to the Dao Court through Master Gu would likely bring him considerable rewards.</p><p>Regardless, it was a win-win situation for Qin Sang.</p><p>What truly captivated Qin Sang was Master Gu's refinement process. He had numerous questions and eagerly began to inquire.</p><p>Master Gu, also eager to comprehend her recent insights, provided Qin Sang with a concise explanation, then retreated into seclusion with the spiritual drum, leaving Qin Sang alone in the fire chamber.</p><p>After Master Gu left, Qin Sang remained in the fire chamber for days, continuously refining something.</p><p>Finally, two fist-sized bone spheres floated before him.</p><p>One black, one white, they were the refined remnants of Xiahou's antlers, transformed into spiritual embryos after days of refinement.</p><p>He decided to integrate the bone spheres into his gauntlets, refining the treasure anew, but not here.</p><p>Master Gu was in seclusion, and he didn't wish to disturb her. Qin Sang left a letter and departed from White Rock County.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang hesitated, his thoughts turning to the other two items within his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>The Crude Jade acquired from the Formless Immortal Sect and the White Go Stone obtained from the Sundering Flask Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang had sought appraisals for the three fragmented treasures, but he kept these two, intending to comprehend them himself.</p><p>Over the past century, while his artifact refinement skills had improved significantly, he still couldn't decipher their origins.</p><p>As for the Yin Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art, he certainly couldn’t afford any further distractions in the short term.</p><p>"Should I seek further guidance from others?"</p><p>Qin Sang wavered, ultimately abandoning the idea.</p><p>Both the Crude Jade and the White Go Stone were related to the Yin Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art, tied to a specific Dao Lineage. If that lineage clashed with this world's principles and was recognized by someone with ulterior motives, it would only invite further trouble.</p><p>Only after returning from White Rock County did Qin Sang visit Master Qi.</p><p>Master Qi, never one for tidiness, could now be described as disheveled and unkempt. Aware of his limited time, he dared not waste a single moment.</p><p>His disciples, understanding their master’s dedication, wore expressions of sorrow.</p><p>Sensing the oppressive atmosphere within the residence, Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Without announcing himself, he pushed open the door and entered.</p><p>Startled awake, Master Qi raised his bloodshot eyes, his expression dazed.</p><p>“Master, have you succumbed to madness?” Qin Sang shook his head repeatedly, forcibly pulling Master Qi to the doorway.</p><p>Bathed in the sunlight, Master Qi gradually regained his clarity.</p><p>After a long silence, Master Qi murmured in a hoarse voice, "I have only ten years left to live!"</p><p>Knowing Master Qi's aspirations, Qin Sang didn't know how to console him. He sighed, "I came here hoping to offer any assistance I could, Master."</p><p>With that, he waved his sleeve, sweeping away the clutter in the fire chamber and storing the True Treasure fragments within his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Seeing the True Treasure fragments being taken away, Master Qi nearly flew into a rage.</p><p>“Don’t worry! Look at this!”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his sleeve again.</p><p>Two gauntlets, the black and white bone spheres, and several orbs of varying sizes floated in the air.</p><p>Master Qi’s gaze was instantly drawn to the black and white bone spheres. With his discerning eye, though he couldn't identify their origin, he could sense their extraordinary nature.</p><p>“I intend to re-refine this treasure and wish to request Master's assistance. What are your thoughts, Master?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Master Qi eagerly nodded his agreement.</p><p>Seeing him fixated on the bone spheres, Qin Sang smiled and placed them directly into his hands.</p><p>Master Qi held them with undisguised fascination, sitting down on the spot and analyzing them with a secret technique, oblivious to his surroundings. However, a moment later, a look of anxiety appeared on his face. “This…I fear my skills are insufficient. I might ruin Fellow Daoist’s hard work…”</p><p>He recognized the immense value of the bone spheres, far surpassing any demon bone he had encountered in his lifetime.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand dismissively. "We will refine it together. Even if we fail, how can the blame fall solely on Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Master Qi finally understood Qin Sang's good intentions. He took a deep breath, his lips moving as he rose and bowed deeply. “Thank you, Fellow Daoist, for this opportunity!”</p><p>The two then sealed the fire chamber, remaining inside for several months.</p><p>During these months, Qin Sang both explained his ideas and instructed Master Qi in artifact refinement techniques.</p><p>Of course, this so-called instruction consisted of what Qin Sang had just learned from Master Gu. He was essentially learning and teaching simultaneously, passing on what he could share to Master Qi.</p><p>Once, Qin Sang had learned from Master Qi. Now, their roles were reversed, yet Master Qi didn't mind in the slightest, absorbing everything like a sponge.</p><p>Finally, the day of the refinement arrived. Master Qi’s face radiated confidence as he and Qin Sang sat on opposite sides of the square cauldron.</p><p>Once again, Qin Sang controlled the fire, but this time he also participated in the refinement, the two working together seamlessly.</p><p>The two gauntlets flew into the square cauldron.</p><p>Then, the black and white bone spheres and the other orbs followed suit, merging within. Only a mass of gray, pulsating gel remained inside the cauldron, the shape of the gauntlets no longer discernible.</p><p>The spiritual fire burned fiercely.</p><p>The aura within the square cauldron constantly shifted. Both Qin Sang and Master Qi closed their eyes, continuously forming hand seals and directing them towards the cauldron.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the square cauldron suddenly vibrated. Master Qi, his face alight with excitement, struck the cauldron's side with a resounding clap.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A streak of blood-red light shot out, erupting with an incredibly sharp aura.</p><p>The blood-red light circled in the air before landing in Master Qi’s hand. After examining it, he laughed heartily and tossed it towards Qin Sang.</p><p>As Qin Sang caught it, he instantly felt a connection as if it were part of his own blood. A coolness coursed through him, and the object in his palm vanished without a trace.</p><p>Looking at his hand, Qin Sang focused his mind. A blood-red light flickered in his palm, and a sharp blood-colored spike silently emerged.</p><p>A sword in his palm, or perhaps, a spike in his palm!</p><p>Qin Sang's physical body was now incredibly strong, making the gauntlets more of an embellishment. After careful consideration, he decided to abandon the gauntlets and refine this unexpected weapon instead.</p><p>Of course, this treasure held another layer of significance, a validation of Qin Sang's accumulated knowledge in the path of artifact refinement.</p><p>By refining this treasure, both of them gained considerable insights.</p><p>After remaining at the Star Island Immortal Lake for several more months, Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling, preparing to explore the Venomous Grotto!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
